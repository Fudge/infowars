[00:00:12.907 --> 00:00:18.928]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:19.528 --> 00:00:22.589]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:39.633]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be a particularly jam-packed Friday worldwide broadcast, the 29th day already of April 2016.
[00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:47.916]  We have Roger Stone joining us in 30 minutes to deal with this incredible disinformation job.
[00:00:48.476 --> 00:00:50.619]  Quote, it smacks of a political smear job.
[00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.186]  Former Trump aide tears apart rape lawsuit, claiming that Donald Trump eons ago supposedly raped someone.
[00:00:59.107 --> 00:01:01.809]  Boy, this is all happening right on time, isn't it?
[00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.514]  As he clearly takes the lead and is clearly the presumptive nominee.
[00:01:07.574 --> 00:01:11.995]  We then also have Dr. Cynthia McKinney, former Congresswoman, joining us.
[00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:19.277]  She supports our analysis of the Beyonce situation being a CIA-funded race war program.
[00:01:19.797 --> 00:01:24.619]  She's going to be joining us, and so will Robert David Steele, formerly of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:30.524]  He also, they both reached out to me and said, we'd like to come on because you're absolutely dead on.
[00:01:30.884 --> 00:01:34.348]  Well, it's public that that's what's going on, but they made a big deal about it saying it doesn't exist.
[00:01:34.708 --> 00:01:43.196]  We won't spend the whole second hour just on Beyonce, but with media control, dirty tricks, some of the other agencies and groups that are involved in manipulating the situation.
[00:01:43.897 --> 00:01:48.363]  Rob Dewell pop in, he's on the ground in California or will be landing soon.
[00:01:48.683 --> 00:02:00.618]  The site of physical attacks, racial attacks, people trying to run folks over with their cars, just all sorts of horrible stuff and the mainstream media called it a protest.
[00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:03.465]  And tried to spend the whole thing.
[00:02:04.326 --> 00:02:14.338]  Peter Shipp will then pop in on the incredible jobs numbers and economic numbers that are coming out, and then David Knight will anchor the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:18.216]  First off, simply the worst.
[00:02:18.356 --> 00:02:24.499]  Obama is first president ever to not see a single year of 3% GDP growth.
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.341]  And that's with some of the most cook numbers they've ever engaged in.
[00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:29.482]  We'll be looking at that.
[00:02:29.922 --> 00:02:32.584]  We'll also look at the political correctness area.
[00:02:33.244 --> 00:02:35.525]  Leftists, hilariously triggered.
[00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:37.827]  No, they're conquering society.
[00:02:37.847 --> 00:02:38.607]  They're not triggered.
[00:02:39.047 --> 00:02:40.068]  They rule language.
[00:02:41.048 --> 00:02:42.029]  They are our masters.
[00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.929]  They're not triggered.
[00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.531]  They are prodding and nudging and bullying.
[00:02:46.863 --> 00:02:54.788]  Leftists hilariously triggered by inflammatory sign at Target bathrooms because it said men can use women's and women's can use men.
[00:02:55.228 --> 00:02:59.191]  The word man and woman is hurtful and this is a straight-faced headline.
[00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:04.114]  Up on Infowars.com out of the Seattle Times.
[00:03:08.536 --> 00:03:17.019]  University of Washington pulls cheerleader tryout advice after angry backlash because it's quote too feminine and talks about looking like a woman.
[00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:21.181]  See, your identity as a woman or a man is over.
[00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:23.622]  They want asexualism.
[00:03:24.082 --> 00:03:26.343]  That's in Brave New World, written in 1932.
[00:03:27.483 --> 00:03:37.127]  And Aldous Huxley, whose brother Julian Huxley run UNESCO, that sets the global parameters, in 1961 gave a speech at Berkeley, one hour speech, it's online,
[00:03:37.887 --> 00:03:48.815]  We've played it here where he said, listen, I wrote this book and you see some of it coming true because our goal is by the year 2000 to basically have this book be reality.
[00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:49.896]  This is a real plan.
[00:03:50.957 --> 00:03:52.978]  And he wrote the book Brave New World Revisited.
[00:03:53.018 --> 00:03:54.279]  Now, you notice they didn't quite get there.
[00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:54.920]  They're behind.
[00:03:56.701 --> 00:04:05.427]  But this is the ruling class eugenics families that in the 1850s developed this entire Manhattan Project on PCP
[00:04:06.653 --> 00:04:18.585]  To take over the human system, to take over all biological life and conquer humanity and the earth by creating a new creation, basically, and they're beta testing it all right now.
[00:04:19.245 --> 00:04:22.769]  They envision computers, the DNA double helix, everything.
[00:04:24.048 --> 00:04:26.390]  And they hate the power of femininity.
[00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.252]  They hate the power of male masculinity.
[00:04:28.272 --> 00:04:29.673]  They are attacking the species.
[00:04:29.713 --> 00:04:34.817]  Imagine if they said, that male tiger is too handsome and strong and has too much prowess.
[00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:38.761]  Let's drug the animals to make them behave nicer and sweeter.
[00:04:39.081 --> 00:04:40.142]  We're supposed to be primal.
[00:04:40.162 --> 00:04:51.412]  But see, someone like Trigley Puff is threatened by women in traditional, beautiful, powerful, feminine roles.
[00:04:52.557 --> 00:04:54.819]  So see, first they tell women you should have any role you want.
[00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:55.460]  Fine, whatever.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.663]  Then it's, no, your original role is over.
[00:04:58.963 --> 00:05:01.086]  This is species conquering event.
[00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:03.928]  This is just part of what's coming up today.
[00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.271]  This is a big transmission.
[00:05:06.751 --> 00:05:08.673]  Roger Stone has Gigantor News.
[00:05:08.693 --> 00:05:09.074]  Straight ahead.
[00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:12.751]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:05:12.831 --> 00:05:16.795]  Pro-ISIS hackers post kill lists of State Department employees.
[00:05:17.015 --> 00:05:25.384]  Hackers with a pro-ISIS group calling themselves United Cyber Caliphate distributed a kill list that appears to include dozens of US government personnel.
[00:05:25.524 --> 00:05:28.487]  The list features 43 names of people linked to the
[00:05:28.507 --> 00:05:29.007]  We're good to go.
[00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:01.281]  As a socialist, the word socialism does not frighten me and I think it's probably fair to say that the Nicaraguan government is primarily a socialist government.
[00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.983]  That was Bernie Sanders praising the Nicaraguan communist Sandinistas 30 years ago.
[00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:31.716]  As we see today with the rationing of food, water, medicine and electricity in Venezuela, the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people's money.
[00:06:31.916 --> 00:06:36.918]  Now Bernie Sandinista, the proud socialist, is running out of other people's money.
[00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:40.300]  And he's having to lay off hundreds of staff from his campaign.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.881]  Wait!
[00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:43.622]  Can't he just create jobs out of thin air?
[00:06:43.842 --> 00:06:45.563]  Have them dig ditches or something?
[00:06:45.743 --> 00:06:49.365]  Bernie's campaign is the closest he's ever come to managing a business.
[00:06:49.625 --> 00:06:51.106]  And his business is failing.
[00:06:51.306 --> 00:06:59.930]  Even paying his interns only $12 an hour, not quite up to the socialist mandate of $15 an hour, he still can't make ends meet.
[00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.832]  I will be attacked by every editorial writer in the free press for being a dumb dupe.
[00:07:04.052 --> 00:07:04.592]  Maybe I am.
[00:07:05.052 --> 00:07:07.474]  You know, socialism has duped a lot of people.
[00:07:07.914 --> 00:07:09.735]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:07:10.683 --> 00:07:17.568]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote, Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[00:07:17.668 --> 00:07:22.831]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties, or in his possessions.
[00:07:23.172 --> 00:07:26.374]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[00:07:26.514 --> 00:07:28.575]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:34.139]  And how do we remove that power from Washington, to our local communities, to the individual?
[00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:35.880]  That is the ultimate concern.
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.322]  The concentration of power, the excess of power,
[00:07:38.442 --> 00:07:42.184]  ...was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[00:07:42.264 --> 00:07:44.625]  It was why the Anti-Federalists opposed the Constitution.
[00:07:44.705 --> 00:07:48.847]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power.
[00:07:49.007 --> 00:07:53.309]  But as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:58.751]  People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[00:07:59.131 --> 00:08:04.193]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[00:08:04.494 --> 00:08:07.975]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[00:08:08.195 --> 00:08:10.036]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:08:10.811 --> 00:08:11.692]  We've got it.
[00:08:11.912 --> 00:08:17.595]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:08:17.676 --> 00:08:19.757]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:19.957 --> 00:08:21.798]  Alright, here I go.
[00:08:22.058 --> 00:08:27.722]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:30.784 --> 00:08:31.585]  We've got it.
[00:08:35.141 --> 00:08:38.905]  We all knew that there'd be some giant new hit piece coming out.
[00:08:39.905 --> 00:08:42.708]  I predicted.
[00:08:42.968 --> 00:08:54.878]  Wednesday morning, when Trump had swept another five states, totally dominating, that they would come out and claim he's organized crime, a sexual predator of some type, or working for the Russians.
[00:08:55.299 --> 00:08:56.560]  You know, something outrageous.
[00:08:58.695 --> 00:09:05.877]  And now they have come out and are claiming that some woman says decades ago that Donald Trump raped her.
[00:09:06.657 --> 00:09:12.999]  Roger Stone is going to be popping in at the bottom of the hour to address this absolutely ridiculous garbage.
[00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:21.481]  And of course Roger Stone has known Trump 40 plus years and when Trump has been divorced and Stone's been divorced he's
[00:09:22.659 --> 00:09:23.440]  Trump's wingman.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.340]  They're like buddies.
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.241]  They're friends.
[00:09:26.362 --> 00:09:28.544]  And so that's really the inside baseball.
[00:09:28.604 --> 00:09:30.585]  And he can tell you the truth about Donald Trump.
[00:09:30.885 --> 00:09:32.647]  No one's ever claimed anything like this.
[00:09:33.267 --> 00:09:34.228]  This is just horse manure.
[00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.452]  But this is what goes on, and you're going to see more of it to try to take down the Nationalists.
[00:09:41.012 --> 00:09:50.516]  They have basically indicted Marie Le Pen, who's another Nationalist in France, leading in presidential polls.
[00:09:51.377 --> 00:09:56.559]  They're talking about wanting to try to arrest the new president of Austria for his hate speech or whatever.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.422]  This is what they're doing to counter Nationalism and conquer us via Globalism.
[00:10:03.797 --> 00:10:05.298]  So that's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:10:05.618 --> 00:10:07.700]  Let me get into this first right now.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.642]  Our reporters are in the air.
[00:10:10.922 --> 00:10:12.183]  They will be there in the next few hours.
[00:10:13.503 --> 00:10:21.949]  They will be covering events, further Trump events, the next two days in California that have been some of the most violent so far.
[00:10:26.272 --> 00:10:31.235]  At first California rally, Trump honors families of those killed by illegal aliens.
[00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:33.417]  That's real clear politics.
[00:10:34.548 --> 00:10:49.100]  But that doesn't end up getting on the controlled news, which has a 6% trusted rate with the people, because they're too busy putting out headlines like this that are double lies.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:58.147]  They don't report about why Trump's there, and then they twist and spin and engage in diversions
[00:11:00.339 --> 00:11:03.522]  When it comes to what happened last night in two different cities.
[00:11:04.522 --> 00:11:09.066]  Protest rage outside Trump rally in Orange County.
[00:11:09.086 --> 00:11:11.748]  17 arrested, police car smashed.
[00:11:12.369 --> 00:11:18.694]  The headline should be anti-Trump mob attacks police, men, women and children.
[00:11:20.596 --> 00:11:24.039]  I mean just two days ago it was pepper spraying little Hispanic girls.
[00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:28.963]  When these crowds of Mexican wave flag wannabe gangsters
[00:11:30.737 --> 00:11:35.218]  Mexican flag-waving wannabe gangsters find Hispanics that are Trump supporters.
[00:11:35.258 --> 00:11:38.839]  They physically attack them and start screaming, you're a traitor, you're a sellout.
[00:11:39.219 --> 00:11:45.000]  Donald Trump's whole family is married to Asians and Hispanics and Jews and everybody else.
[00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:47.781]  I mean, they're a very, very inclusive family.
[00:11:48.081 --> 00:11:49.721]  He's not attacking Mexico.
[00:11:52.642 --> 00:11:54.743]  He's saying we've got bad deals with Mexico.
[00:11:55.143 --> 00:11:58.844]  Mexico arrests people that are illegal, puts them in forced labor camps.
[00:11:59.184 --> 00:12:00.024]  We're going to build a wall.
[00:12:01.294 --> 00:12:09.500]  And the media creates this giant pity party and goes, oh my gosh, we're so sorry, Hispanics, that Trump says you're all criminals and that you're bad people.
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.603]  No, he said Mexico's dumping its criminals on us and that's an admitted fact.
[00:12:13.883 --> 00:12:21.088]  Mexico has collapsed in many areas and is a failed state with 100,000 dead in the last decade known and another 70,000 missing.
[00:12:21.108 --> 00:12:21.568]  170,000 dead.
[00:12:21.588 --> 00:12:23.530]  That's worse than the Vietnam War.
[00:12:29.278 --> 00:12:32.319]  By the way, I wish Mexico would become a first world nation.
[00:12:32.599 --> 00:12:36.499]  It's a beautiful country, but it's being swallowed into corruption.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:47.902]  So, he's out there to talk about the violence, the corruption coming across, and how nationalism has been demonized in public schools in this country for 50 years.
[00:12:47.942 --> 00:12:53.303]  So if you wear an American flag at a public school in California, Oregon, or other states,
[00:12:54.485 --> 00:13:04.293]  The illegals in many schools are the majority and they're threatened by the American flag and the schools have ruled all across the country you can't have an American flag on your shirt.
[00:13:07.255 --> 00:13:08.296]  But you can have a Mexican flag.
[00:13:10.078 --> 00:13:10.998]  So that's what this is.
[00:13:11.459 --> 00:13:13.981]  Protests rage outside Trump rally in Orange County.
[00:13:14.001 --> 00:13:14.701]  17 arrested.
[00:13:14.941 --> 00:13:15.902]  Police car smashed.
[00:13:16.423 --> 00:13:23.749]  We have the real footage up on InfoWars.com and we can't really play a lot of it here because of the cussing and out of control behavior but we're talking about
[00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:42.643]  Illegal aliens, wannabe gangbangers, Black Lives Matter, black supremacist, brain-dead teenagers, and vile social justice warriors just running around screaming with hate, acting like lunatics, attacking basically white people.
[00:13:45.603 --> 00:13:46.963]  And then laughing and giggling.
[00:13:47.024 --> 00:13:53.125]  I mean, if I was driving along with my family and people ran around us trying to attack us, I'd just pull the gun out and say, okay, you got two seconds to get back.
[00:13:53.145 --> 00:13:53.745]  You don't get back,
[00:13:54.633 --> 00:13:56.014]  I mean, I'm going to defend my family.
[00:13:56.714 --> 00:13:58.475]  That's why this kind of stuff isn't going on in Texas.
[00:13:59.796 --> 00:14:10.101]  Turning over police cars, burning things down, and of course the police go, get in a fetal position and start urinating on themselves because that's what they've been trained to do in this politically correct situation.
[00:14:13.983 --> 00:14:17.805]  So, here's one headline, protesters rage outside Trump rally in Orange County.
[00:14:18.486 --> 00:14:19.606]  17 arrested, police car smashed.
[00:14:19.626 --> 00:14:20.567]  They don't tell you who did it.
[00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:26.672]  Headline should be anti-Trump thugs physically attack police and citizens.
[00:14:27.232 --> 00:14:28.252]  Try to block free speech.
[00:14:29.612 --> 00:14:34.214]  While holding up their peace signs, which is actually the rune of death in old Norse culture.
[00:14:34.234 --> 00:14:36.995]  I don't even know they've got a banner that says death.
[00:14:37.815 --> 00:14:38.655]  Death to life.
[00:14:38.675 --> 00:14:39.876]  It's a dead tree.
[00:14:40.696 --> 00:14:41.756]  This is a life rune.
[00:14:42.176 --> 00:14:43.177]  This is a death rune.
[00:14:43.557 --> 00:14:45.737]  Just let me educate all you morons.
[00:14:46.238 --> 00:14:47.438]  You might want to know what your flag is.
[00:14:48.593 --> 00:14:52.876]  Anti-Trump protesters tangle with drivers, police in Costa Mesa.
[00:14:53.116 --> 00:14:59.160]  So now if I go out and mug you, that's what they did, they robbed people, stole their wallets, knocked their heads in, ran over people.
[00:14:59.821 --> 00:15:03.083]  If you do that, you just say, oh, I tangled!
[00:15:04.864 --> 00:15:09.007]  No, if someone mugs you or attacks you, you were assaulted and it's a felony.
[00:15:09.287 --> 00:15:10.668]  It wasn't tangling.
[00:15:11.068 --> 00:15:12.369]  And there's hundreds of headlines.
[00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:14.631]  Did you hear about the tangling last night?
[00:15:15.976 --> 00:15:20.859]  CBS News, Los Angeles, anti-Trump protesters tangle with drivers, police and Costa Mesa.
[00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:22.780]  Oh, they tangled with them.
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.982]  No, they came out and assaulted everyone trying to shut down free speech.
[00:15:27.642 --> 00:15:28.863]  Our reporters are going to be there tonight.
[00:15:29.603 --> 00:15:30.624]  By the way, I didn't send them.
[00:15:30.664 --> 00:15:31.244]  They wanted to go.
[00:15:34.727 --> 00:15:36.568]  Now, the Daily Mail actually got it right.
[00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:40.030]  Protesters clash with cops at California Trump rally.
[00:15:40.411 --> 00:15:49.577]  Hundreds of Mexican flag waving demonstrators smash up a squad car, punch a Donald supporter, and scuffle with riot police amid angry scenes.
[00:15:51.087 --> 00:15:52.308]  That itself is a whitewash.
[00:15:52.348 --> 00:15:53.489]  There's going off what's on the videos.
[00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:56.311]  Now here's a true headline by Kit Daniels.
[00:15:56.852 --> 00:15:58.253]  We can go to InfoWars.com.
[00:15:58.313 --> 00:16:02.537]  You can also go to DrudgeReport.com where our reports are right up at the top of Drudge if you want to find these.
[00:16:02.877 --> 00:16:03.677]  DrudgeReport.com.
[00:16:03.697 --> 00:16:06.760]  We'll put that on screen for folks and click on it for TV viewers so they can find it.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.622]  Radio listeners is DrudgeReport.com.
[00:16:09.162 --> 00:16:11.184]  Anti-Trump protesters riot
[00:16:12.432 --> 00:16:16.175]  Attack supporters damage cop car in Orange County.
[00:16:16.656 --> 00:16:18.938]  That, quite frankly, isn't a hardcore enough headline.
[00:16:19.338 --> 00:16:21.580]  Protesters block traffic, harass Trump supporters.
[00:16:23.141 --> 00:16:24.122]  But it's a truthful headline.
[00:16:24.142 --> 00:16:25.223]  I'm just saying, Kit's a great guy.
[00:16:25.243 --> 00:16:28.246]  Just even our folks can't, you know, get the magnitude of this.
[00:16:29.727 --> 00:16:32.129]  Here's Paul Watson's headline up on DrugsReport.com.
[00:16:32.249 --> 00:16:32.710]  Video.
[00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:39.976]  Mexican flag-waving anti-Trumpers beat Trump supporters, attack vehicles, gang member wannabes stage riot in Orange County.
[00:16:43.049 --> 00:16:44.710]  Now this is really the powerful video.
[00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.151]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:52.216]  And again, even my crew doesn't get it hardcore enough in the fact that we don't want to be sensational.
[00:16:52.896 --> 00:16:53.957]  But this is sensational.
[00:16:53.997 --> 00:17:01.242]  This guy is doing donuts in the middle of, driving into the middle of the pro-Trump people, knocking them down, almost running over them.
[00:17:02.343 --> 00:17:08.688]  And the headline should be, anti-Trump crazy tries to run over Trump supporters.
[00:17:11.141 --> 00:17:17.565]  By the way, I would expect a cop, when that's going on, to level their firearm and fire into the windshield of that vehicle.
[00:17:18.125 --> 00:17:23.048]  Let me tell you something, I see somebody driving around in a car like that in a crowd of people, I'm going to pull a gun out of my car and I'm going to kill you.
[00:17:23.889 --> 00:17:28.111]  You know why I'm not looking for the trouble, but I'm not going to let somebody menace the public or myself.
[00:17:28.472 --> 00:17:32.334]  That is assault with a deadly weapon right there, endangering everyone.
[00:17:35.342 --> 00:17:37.902]  And that is the type of bedlam that's going to be turned loose in this country.
[00:17:37.923 --> 00:17:44.484]  And I don't even have anything against these idiot young people out here that believe the mainstream media and think they're going out to do a good thing and the rap videos saying, kill Donald Trump!
[00:17:44.764 --> 00:17:45.604]  Kill Donald Trump!
[00:17:46.624 --> 00:17:49.325]  They believe that this is okay to do because the TV tells them so.
[00:17:49.705 --> 00:17:53.605]  And the New York Times has writers saying, time to kill Trump, and all this garbage.
[00:17:53.645 --> 00:17:55.486]  But look at what he's really saying.
[00:17:55.946 --> 00:17:56.366]  Nothing.
[00:17:57.786 --> 00:18:01.387]  We have bad trade deals, our border's wide open, and we shouldn't sit here and put up with it.
[00:18:02.591 --> 00:18:11.134]  And that turns into the end of the world with the Communist Chinese that have mobile execution vans running around killing people, killing Buddhists that have done nothing.
[00:18:11.154 --> 00:18:19.016]  But nobody cares about that or the Apple slave factories because DC is filled with a bunch of pot-bellied pedophiles like Dennis Hastert.
[00:18:19.156 --> 00:18:24.578]  But nobody cares about Penn State or the Catholic Church or the pedophile groups in both parties.
[00:18:25.078 --> 00:18:25.518]  No, no, no.
[00:18:25.578 --> 00:18:26.919]  It's all Donald Trump.
[00:18:27.019 --> 00:18:28.159]  He's the bad man.
[00:18:31.465 --> 00:18:42.990]  And oh my gosh, the University of Washington is banning cheerleaders, you know, or they're having a backlash because cheerleaders are pretty and that's too feminine, so being feminine is not allowed now.
[00:18:46.132 --> 00:18:46.692]  Here's another one.
[00:18:46.752 --> 00:18:51.935]  Murderers, rapists, kidnappers, nearly 20,000 criminal aliens released last year alone.
[00:18:52.395 --> 00:18:54.076]  But that's okay, that's out of the Daily Caller.
[00:18:55.066 --> 00:19:02.130]  Lake County undocumented immigrant, I love how they use the word Obama says use, illegal alien, gets life for deadly crime spree.
[00:19:04.371 --> 00:19:08.814]  Powerful moment at Trump rally, families who have lost loved ones to illegal immigrant criminals speak out.
[00:19:08.974 --> 00:19:10.855]  That's why the illegals are so upset.
[00:19:11.255 --> 00:19:14.897]  The border may be open, but the White House will now get a new big giant fence.
[00:19:15.677 --> 00:19:16.658]  A big wall around it.
[00:19:16.678 --> 00:19:20.300]  That's just some of the news we have in that stack.
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.542]  Then, coming up, Hillary plays the woman card.
[00:19:24.892 --> 00:19:29.496]  There's a video, three minutes of her at dozens of rallies saying, women, women, women, women, women, we're women.
[00:19:29.736 --> 00:19:30.757]  We're standing up to the men.
[00:19:31.177 --> 00:19:31.977]  Give me a break.
[00:19:32.278 --> 00:19:36.641]  This woman absolutely uses women and everyone else who wants you to be a slave of the state.
[00:19:37.001 --> 00:19:38.162]  Give me a break.
[00:19:38.563 --> 00:19:42.686]  Hillary offers woman card to supporters as campaign focuses on gender.
[00:19:43.226 --> 00:19:55.133]  Yeah, we just focused on Obama's black, so it's okay if he doubles black unemployment, and is the worst president ever not to see a single year of 3% growth, and that's even with their numbers cooking it up.
[00:19:56.413 --> 00:20:00.356]  Oh, don't worry though, we've already seen premium spikes the last two years under Obamacare.
[00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:06.919]  It's being announced in the Associated Press, significant premium hikes expected now this year and next.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.241]  Oh, I'm afraid it's a screw job.
[00:20:10.788 --> 00:20:11.750]  Alright guys, I'm ready.
[00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:12.612]  Let's get ready to roll.
[00:20:12.632 --> 00:20:14.255]  I'm gonna do this without a script.
[00:20:15.176 --> 00:20:15.817]  Bottom line...
[00:20:17.301 --> 00:20:19.541]  People need to get prepared and be self-sufficient.
[00:20:20.222 --> 00:20:22.702]  And so I'm just going to talk for a few minutes and you can just edit it together.
[00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:24.682]  But I'm just going to speak from my heart right now.
[00:20:24.742 --> 00:20:27.363]  So let's get ready and let's start rolling.
[00:20:27.903 --> 00:20:29.203]  I respect my audience.
[00:20:29.383 --> 00:20:38.565]  I know that our viewers and listeners are among the most informed, pro-liberty, pro-human, God-fearing people on the face of the earth.
[00:20:39.005 --> 00:20:41.586]  But in the message I'm about to break down in the next few minutes,
[00:20:42.546 --> 00:20:47.169]  I'm here to remind you and remind myself that the evidence is overwhelming.
[00:20:47.249 --> 00:20:48.550]  It's now time to gear up.
[00:20:49.171 --> 00:20:50.411]  It's time to get ready.
[00:20:50.852 --> 00:20:52.213]  It's time to get prepared.
[00:20:52.593 --> 00:21:05.061]  And if the globalists gauge that we've gotten prepared and that we're ready to defend our republic and that we're ready to protect our families and that we're not going to just be dependent for their UN handouts for our guns, they may actually back off.
[00:21:05.602 --> 00:21:11.726]  I think getting the word out and personally being prepared is the number one
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.502]  ...weapon we have against the globalists.
[00:21:15.363 --> 00:21:20.590]  Their number one weapon is dependency and ignorance and balkanization, and it's time to counter it.
[00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.593]  Geopolitical nightmares are unfolding.
[00:21:23.914 --> 00:21:27.558]  Food prices across the world are exploding, causing revolutions.
[00:21:28.459 --> 00:21:33.461]  And now we see the very same social engineers preparing for carving up this republic.
[00:21:33.921 --> 00:21:37.543]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country.
[00:21:37.903 --> 00:21:40.164]  And quite frankly, my country is planet Earth.
[00:21:40.444 --> 00:21:41.805]  My country is human liberty.
[00:21:41.825 --> 00:21:42.285]  1776 worldwide.
[00:21:44.386 --> 00:21:52.613]  It's time to go to InfoWarsTore.com and prepare and to get the storable foods and the high quality water filtration systems that you need for your family.
[00:21:52.953 --> 00:21:57.997]  Shortwave emergency radios, you name it, we have it all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:21:58.157 --> 00:21:59.198]  And for a limited time
[00:21:59.658 --> 00:22:00.039]  I think?
[00:22:29.718 --> 00:22:35.204]  And it's a contract loophole where we can offer it lower than anyone else, including their other distributors.
[00:22:35.584 --> 00:22:42.511]  I did this because of Infowars' power in the market to leverage in free market to bring you the very best deals.
[00:22:43.151 --> 00:22:53.741]  And quite frankly, that helps us then sell even more food and help fund this operation fighting toe-to-toe with the globalists, using capitalist principles, while there's still a little bit of that left in this country.
[00:22:54.565 --> 00:22:54.765]  I think.
[00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:12.454]  You are getting an amazing deal on it, and you are funding the very tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[00:23:12.634 --> 00:23:14.375]  Bottom line, it's time to get prepared.
[00:23:14.775 --> 00:23:26.643]  And when you wisely choose to shop at Infowarsstore.com, you will get some of the highest quality storable food and other emergency supplies at the lowest prices you're going to find out there for the quality you're getting.
[00:23:26.663 --> 00:23:32.988]  And that helps us, in turn, continue on in this imploding economy to reach people across the U.S.
[00:23:33.208 --> 00:23:36.230]  and across the world when they're finally ready to hear the truth.
[00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:38.751]  InfoWars has crossed the Rubicon.
[00:23:38.791 --> 00:23:41.632]  We are now at the center of the Zeitgeist and you're there with us.
[00:23:42.392 --> 00:23:44.033]  You brought the InfoWars this far.
[00:23:44.493 --> 00:23:49.135]  Now bring it to the next level, all at the same time, getting prepared for you and your family.
[00:23:49.295 --> 00:23:58.739]  So for a limited time, 40 to 30% off all the InfoWars select storable food and you can always get 10% off on the water filtration systems with the promo code WATER.
[00:23:59.199 --> 00:24:00.320]  If you leave me
[00:24:29.287 --> 00:24:34.830]  I won't miss you, and I won't ever take you back.
[00:24:38.411 --> 00:24:45.875]  Girl, your memory won't ever haunt me, cause I don't love you.
[00:24:46.395 --> 00:24:48.496]  Now you'll buy that.
[00:24:50.637 --> 00:24:53.358]  I got some porsche fried fries.
[00:24:53.418 --> 00:24:55.519]  Alex Jones here live, straight shooting you.
[00:24:56.713 --> 00:24:58.513]  Got some big news coming up here at the end of the segment.
[00:24:58.553 --> 00:24:59.094]  Stay with us.
[00:24:59.874 --> 00:25:01.634]  Big broadcast lined up today.
[00:25:01.674 --> 00:25:03.354]  Absolutely jam-packed with guests.
[00:25:03.434 --> 00:25:04.635]  Roger Stone coming up in a moment.
[00:25:07.215 --> 00:25:11.936]  But I also want to walk through these different video clips that we can play here on radio slash television.
[00:25:12.796 --> 00:25:16.357]  Infowars.com forward slash show if you're a radio listener and want to find the free video feeds.
[00:25:17.237 --> 00:25:21.578]  Pro-Trump Hispanics detail racist hate from protesters.
[00:25:22.438 --> 00:25:24.739]  We also have Trump supporter beaten bloody by
[00:25:25.819 --> 00:25:27.401]  The anti-Trump attackers.
[00:25:28.462 --> 00:25:34.589]  We also have video of the insane reckless protester nearly killing people trying to run them over with a car.
[00:25:35.691 --> 00:25:38.374]  Angry mob ransacking Trump supporters car.
[00:25:38.935 --> 00:25:45.002]  Leftists destroy cop car and are like trying to get in people's cars and yelling at them just because they're white.
[00:25:46.769 --> 00:25:48.530]  This is what the media has created.
[00:25:49.271 --> 00:25:54.614]  And such political correctness that if you're Hispanic and you see an American flag, you're supposed to get scared and upset.
[00:25:55.614 --> 00:26:02.959]  Or if you're a woman or a man at the University of Washington or anywhere else, can you see an online flyer about
[00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:07.351]  Cheerleader tryouts and tips on how to look beautiful and feminine.
[00:26:07.731 --> 00:26:10.753]  The fact that femininity was being promoted hurt you.
[00:26:10.873 --> 00:26:12.854]  See, father and mother hurt you.
[00:26:12.974 --> 00:26:14.234]  Male or female hurt you.
[00:26:14.514 --> 00:26:15.135]  He or she.
[00:26:15.215 --> 00:26:16.975]  What if you don't have femininity?
[00:26:17.335 --> 00:26:18.336]  What if you don't identify?
[00:26:18.656 --> 00:26:22.618]  Someone else existing that hurts you.
[00:26:23.058 --> 00:26:28.460]  That's why they started these stunts the last 10 years, you know, making the college beauty queen be a tranny.
[00:26:29.961 --> 00:26:33.182]  To not be inclusive, but to say you can't have it be a woman.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.721]  See, this is a conquering of society.
[00:26:39.661 --> 00:26:44.903]  Leftists hilariously triggered by inflammatory, close quote, sign at Target bathrooms.
[00:26:45.563 --> 00:26:54.845]  Okay, so it's shocking and inflammatory, close quote, because it says men might use the transgender law to their favor to peep little girls and women in the ladies room.
[00:26:55.746 --> 00:26:56.906]  It says, attention ladies.
[00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:59.451]  Now see, that doesn't exist.
[00:26:59.471 --> 00:27:00.432]  You're not allowed to say that.
[00:27:00.952 --> 00:27:05.536]  Target Corps has publicly announced that men may now use the women's restroom.
[00:27:06.457 --> 00:27:07.257]  And vice versa.
[00:27:07.758 --> 00:27:08.739]  No questions asked.
[00:27:09.479 --> 00:27:10.280]  Please be cautious.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.701]  Report suspicious hidden cameras.
[00:27:12.041 --> 00:27:14.103]  Report loitering or peeping individuals.
[00:27:14.523 --> 00:27:17.286]  A lot of public schools put cameras in the showers now, but it's okay when the government does it.
[00:27:17.726 --> 00:27:21.789]  So see, now they're upset by the word he or she or men's or women.
[00:27:21.809 --> 00:27:22.610]  That doesn't exist either.
[00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:24.271]  See, they control everything.
[00:27:24.671 --> 00:27:26.313]  Gender, words, language, they're God.
[00:27:27.853 --> 00:27:30.300]  And here's the article, linked up on InfoWars.com.
[00:27:30.741 --> 00:27:32.807]  University of Washington pulls cheerleader tryout.
[00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:35.896]  Advice after angry backlash.
[00:27:37.944 --> 00:27:48.574]  Makeup do's, bronze, beachy glow, false lashes, girl of out town lipstick, flattering eye shadow, makeup don'ts, dark smokey eyes, nude lips.
[00:27:48.594 --> 00:27:50.316]  I don't know, I want the smokey eyes.
[00:27:50.696 --> 00:27:57.823]  Hair do's, hair do, colored or straight volume, partially off face, hair don'ts, ponytails, slick back, trendy colors.
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.460]  Oh my gosh!
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:00.881]  Let's see.
[00:28:01.161 --> 00:28:11.625]  No one is allowed to have any culture but the culture controllers that the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, UNESCO, and the UN will put out monthly the new OKs.
[00:28:11.705 --> 00:28:13.005]  And the language gets smaller.
[00:28:13.245 --> 00:28:14.866]  What you're allowed to use gets smaller.
[00:28:15.206 --> 00:28:17.387]  You properly listen and then use the words.
[00:28:18.772 --> 00:28:20.253]  They tell you to use.
[00:28:20.854 --> 00:28:22.995]  Isn't that just so sweet and so special?
[00:28:23.015 --> 00:28:25.517]  We're going to be breaking all of that down.
[00:28:25.977 --> 00:28:30.500]  Now, I'm going to roll a Facebook Mentions in the control room live because I'm about to introduce on Facebook.
[00:28:31.721 --> 00:28:32.862]  So folks, tune in right now.
[00:28:33.142 --> 00:28:34.423]  What's about to happen in the next segment?
[00:28:36.004 --> 00:28:47.552]  Roger Stone is going to be coming on, the consummate Trump insider, his wingman of 40 plus years, one of his best friends, not just former campaign head, to break down exactly what is going on.
[00:28:48.499 --> 00:29:11.556]  With the allegations that we knew would come, that he's a rapist, or a pervert, or works for the Russians, or works for the Mafia, and you just knew it was coming, and now Radar Online, quote, it smacks a political smear job, ex-Trump aide, tears apart rape lawsuit, Roger Stone dismisses allegations presidential candidate violated team.
[00:29:12.625 --> 00:29:21.711]  And we're going to go through the inside baseball of this and break the whole thing down, coming up with Roger Stone straight ahead.
[00:29:22.091 --> 00:29:23.272]  Trump is a ladies' man.
[00:29:23.332 --> 00:29:23.952]  It's been well known.
[00:29:23.972 --> 00:29:24.993]  He's been married repeatedly.
[00:29:25.593 --> 00:29:27.375]  In between marriages, he's got girlfriends.
[00:29:28.095 --> 00:29:29.277]  He isn't a hypocrite about it.
[00:29:29.417 --> 00:29:34.364]  He's in the men's bathroom like half these Democrats and Republicans picking up other men.
[00:29:35.246 --> 00:29:36.708]  He's never had any claims before.
[00:29:36.788 --> 00:29:37.789]  No smoke, no fire.
[00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:42.596]  But now because he's dominating and they tried to steal the election from him and it backfired in their face.
[00:29:43.297 --> 00:29:46.759]  Now they're coming out right on time with what you'd expect.
[00:29:46.779 --> 00:29:49.800]  And with Bill Clinton, he's settled rape cases scores of times.
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:50.640]  We know that's real.
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.341]  But the media won't touch that.
[00:29:52.761 --> 00:29:54.002]  Roger Stone's straight ahead.
[00:29:54.322 --> 00:29:56.243]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:29:56.643 --> 00:29:57.863]  Tell everybody you know, tune in.
[00:29:57.903 --> 00:29:58.884]  Roger Stone's coming on.
[00:29:59.584 --> 00:30:00.484]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.965 --> 00:30:02.565]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.506 --> 00:30:06.187]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.134 --> 00:30:13.475]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:30:13.595 --> 00:30:15.856]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:30:16.036 --> 00:30:24.419]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:30:24.679 --> 00:30:28.020]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:38.484]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:30:38.804 --> 00:30:46.087]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:30:46.288 --> 00:30:48.188]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:56.092]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:30:56.292 --> 00:31:01.553]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:04.074]  Introducing Deep Cleanse by InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:33:13.387 --> 00:33:20.813]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:20.993 --> 00:33:23.195]  Well, we knew that it was coming.
[00:33:40.799 --> 00:33:41.741]  We knew that it would happen.
[00:33:43.003 --> 00:33:48.272]  We knew that they would drag you up as soon as it was clear that no one could take the nomination from Trump, that he would go well past the
[00:33:50.315 --> 00:33:56.682]  1237, that they would absolutely just go into crisis mode.
[00:33:56.722 --> 00:34:04.911]  And Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, and of course his good friend and confidant joins us with this breaking information.
[00:34:05.732 --> 00:34:07.614]  Here's the headline out of Radar Online.
[00:34:07.654 --> 00:34:09.916]  He'll break down what the allegations are and what the truth is.
[00:34:10.297 --> 00:34:12.399]  It smacks of a political smear job.
[00:34:13.362 --> 00:34:17.545]  Former Trump aide tears apart rape lawsuit.
[00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:21.067]  Roger Stone dismisses allegations presidential candidate violated teen.
[00:34:21.348 --> 00:34:30.414]  This is the first time we've ever heard something like this in this man's long, almost 50-year public persona.
[00:34:31.094 --> 00:34:35.677]  So Roger Stone joins us to address this and several other big breaking developments.
[00:34:35.737 --> 00:34:36.358]  Roger, thank you.
[00:34:37.923 --> 00:34:41.106]  I've only got a little time here, Alex, but I'm delighted to be with you.
[00:34:41.206 --> 00:34:46.810]  I'm calling from the trenches here, as you can see, in the war to make America great again.
[00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:54.335]  In any event, this is a stunning hoax being perpetrated on Donald Trump.
[00:34:54.375 --> 00:35:04.462]  This shows the extent to which the established order and the ruling class will go to destroy the only man who is a threat to their failed system.
[00:35:05.998 --> 00:35:30.787]  I personally, heavily investigated the entire question of Jeffrey Epstein, the multi-millionaire, billionaire hedge fund manager, an intimate of Bill and Hillary Clinton, and the fact that he had a tangential connection to Trump because he had paid, I don't know, $250,000 to be a member of Trump's Palm Beach Club, a public facility.
[00:35:32.103 --> 00:35:39.354]  I can tell you right now, the woman who filed this lawsuit claiming she met Donald Trump at a sex party.
[00:35:39.774 --> 00:35:40.936]  First of all, that's absurd.
[00:35:41.437 --> 00:35:43.259]  Donald Trump is a family man.
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:44.902]  He's a private man.
[00:35:45.658 --> 00:35:50.161]  He has a very high, puts a very high importance on hygiene.
[00:35:50.541 --> 00:35:55.343]  That is nothing that would indicate that he would participate in something like that.
[00:35:55.864 --> 00:36:10.892]  And then, secondarily, the woman files the claim on her own behalf with no attorney, which is legal, of course, in California, on the 16th, but it has clearly been drafted by an expert lawyer.
[00:36:11.986 --> 00:36:15.389]  So, Alex, it is clearly a hoax.
[00:36:19.092 --> 00:36:24.337]  I tell you, looking at this, the media is not focusing on the Clintons going to this private island.
[00:36:25.038 --> 00:36:29.842]  The media is not focused on the real connections to this group with the Clintons.
[00:36:30.262 --> 00:36:35.908]  Instead, they're focusing on some tiny link because the guy is part of the golf club
[00:36:36.608 --> 00:36:38.430]  That thousands of people are members of.
[00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:40.051]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[00:36:40.091 --> 00:36:48.039]  It's like saying, if Donald Trump ever walked through the same airport as Jeffrey Dahmer, that he's supposedly in league with Jeffrey Dahmer.
[00:36:48.459 --> 00:36:49.621]  This is really desperate, isn't it?
[00:36:50.702 --> 00:36:55.066]  Well, the clear point, of course, here is that Epstein is a convicted pedophile.
[00:36:55.786 --> 00:36:59.530]  I investigated this very thoroughly for my book, The Clinton's War on Women.
[00:37:00.269 --> 00:37:11.456]  Uh, and you can, uh, you can see that the women who testified in that civil case, uh, two of them said, yes, they met Donald Trump at a cocktail party.
[00:37:12.037 --> 00:37:12.337]  Yes.
[00:37:12.637 --> 00:37:13.938]  Uh, he was very polite.
[00:37:13.978 --> 00:37:15.399]  He was never inappropriate.
[00:37:15.739 --> 00:37:16.700]  And he left quickly.
[00:37:17.801 --> 00:37:35.172]  Trump told an instrument in Palm Beach that when he went to a, he was invited to a cocktail party at the home of Epstein, when he got there he said there were a bunch of teenage girls in the pool and he said to his driver, how nice, Jeff let the neighborhood children use his pool.
[00:37:36.973 --> 00:37:42.276]  When he got into the house he didn't realize, he realized that there were an awful lot of young women there.
[00:37:42.636 --> 00:37:44.838]  He was polite to everybody and he left.
[00:37:45.858 --> 00:37:46.839]  That is the extent
[00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:49.891]  Of Trump's knowledge.
[00:37:49.931 --> 00:37:51.572]  Now Epstein had everyone fooled.
[00:37:52.173 --> 00:37:56.696]  He was a major socialite in Palm Beach and in New York.
[00:37:57.396 --> 00:37:59.318]  And he certainly had a relationship with Trump.
[00:37:59.618 --> 00:38:02.440]  He had paid Trump to belong to his club.
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:11.046]  But I thoroughly investigated these claims because there is a little black book held by Epstein.
[00:38:11.527 --> 00:38:13.068]  It does contain Trump's number.
[00:38:13.823 --> 00:38:15.724]  But that's not unusual.
[00:38:16.184 --> 00:38:32.570]  It also, more importantly, contains the number for Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin, the two top operatives for Hillary Clinton, and 22 different phone notations for Bubba himself.
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:39.224]  But this woman's name, the woman filing the false claim against Trump, does not appear in the phone book.
[00:38:39.344 --> 00:38:46.028]  And by the way, the Daily Mail, Radar, and others, they're all basically agreeing with you, saying this appears to be a giant hoax.
[00:38:46.068 --> 00:38:54.273]  Trump's lawyer has come out and said, rape lawsuit, a hoax, and says there's no proof the accuser exists, as he claims her address and phone number are fakes.
[00:38:54.293 --> 00:38:56.054]  So who do we think is behind this, Roger?
[00:38:56.234 --> 00:38:56.995]  Who are the suspects?
[00:38:57.878 --> 00:39:07.723]  Well, first of all, let's notice that it's the British press, even though it's a great worldwide information source, but it is the British press who is pointing out the hoax.
[00:39:07.823 --> 00:39:11.784]  Notice the mainstream media press here isn't as disgusted.
[00:39:11.884 --> 00:39:17.547]  Now, I could, Alex, very easily say, hmm, now who would perpetrate such a hoax?
[00:39:18.267 --> 00:39:23.830]  I could, just as Ted Cruz falsely accused me of planting a story against him,
[00:39:24.418 --> 00:39:29.882]  In the National Enquirer, I could easily accuse Ted Cruz of planting this.
[00:39:30.242 --> 00:39:32.424]  But I must tell you, I don't rule it out.
[00:39:32.924 --> 00:39:34.805]  Let's just say we are investigating.
[00:39:36.166 --> 00:39:36.466]  Wow.
[00:39:36.647 --> 00:39:39.929]  Now, a couple days ago, you said, listen, I've got really big news.
[00:39:39.949 --> 00:39:40.829]  You told me what it was.
[00:39:40.909 --> 00:39:41.490]  It's huge.
[00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:45.793]  You said we need to get an article out on it, but I need to look at all the angles.
[00:39:46.273 --> 00:39:51.477]  Are you getting ready to talk about the huge news you relayed to myself and I know others two days ago?
[00:39:52.642 --> 00:39:57.564]  Yes, I think we're going to be able to expose the entire battle plan of the establishment.
[00:39:58.004 --> 00:40:02.885]  They are passing an amendment around to the rules.
[00:40:03.366 --> 00:40:09.328]  They are raising money for a quote-unquote advertising blitz.
[00:40:10.448 --> 00:40:19.471]  The details are still coming in, but very clearly the Romney-Bush-Cruz alliance
[00:40:20.356 --> 00:40:27.080]  The insiders, the GOP brahmin, are preparing to steal this from Donald Trump.
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:31.103]  Even though Trump moves inexorably towards the nomination.
[00:40:32.223 --> 00:40:34.505]  Alex, the only people who want Trump are the people.
[00:40:35.065 --> 00:40:37.607]  He wins giant victories across the Northeast.
[00:40:38.247 --> 00:40:39.748]  He hits 58% in every demographic.
[00:40:45.663 --> 00:40:52.212]  And he is ignored by the party bosses, who I think will still go to any extent.
[00:40:52.252 --> 00:41:00.363]  So even if he gets to 1237, which I believe he is going to prior to the convention, I feel very good about his prospects in Indiana.
[00:41:00.783 --> 00:41:05.769]  There is a new team in charge at Trump when it comes to delegate selection.
[00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:09.093]  There's a very strong media campaign.
[00:41:09.434 --> 00:41:11.516]  First time we've seen that from the Trump operation.
[00:41:11.857 --> 00:41:15.181]  Plus, Trump himself is the best campaigner in the Republican Party.
[00:41:15.681 --> 00:41:17.784]  Trump draws crowds like nobody else can.
[00:41:17.824 --> 00:41:18.765]  That means buzz.
[00:41:19.266 --> 00:41:20.367]  And buzz means buzz.
[00:41:21.499 --> 00:41:33.426]  In the few minutes we've got left, can you flesh out a little bit more of when we're going to be able to see this internal battle plan by the RNC that you've had a few days, and who exactly is behind it, and what they're planning to do?
[00:41:34.587 --> 00:41:46.474]  Well, I want to make sure that everything I tell you, Alex, and your listeners, and those who are engaged in the fight for liberty, and who are prepared to take on the establishment that have run this country into the ditch,
[00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:51.713]  I want to be sure everything that I'm learning is correct, so stay tuned.
[00:41:51.753 --> 00:42:00.298]  You'll hear about it here at Infowars.com, because unlike CNN, unlike MSNBC, they don't believe in censorship here.
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:12.671]  In closing, we know that this is the type of hit piece that we expected, but it doesn't even say who it's from or what it is, and the press checks it, and it's not even real, but our controlled media is still running with it.
[00:42:13.892 --> 00:42:15.434]  Do you think this is going to damage Trump?
[00:42:15.474 --> 00:42:24.242]  Is anybody going to buy into that he's a known ladies' man, he's been, you know, he's been remarried repeatedly, you've known him forever, you're a personal friend, you know, you guys
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.521]  Well, and it's a double-edged sword.
[00:42:26.541 --> 00:42:29.263]  I mean, if anybody has exposure on the Epstein issue, it would be Bill Clinton.
[00:42:46.986 --> 00:43:00.850]  I mean, in my book, Clinton's War on Women, I point out that he is on Epstein's plane, private plane, that they called the Alita Express because it was like a Hugh Hefner operation, you know, round bed and plenty of teenage girls to play with.
[00:43:01.714 --> 00:43:03.856]  Bill Clinton was on that plane 17 times.
[00:43:03.916 --> 00:43:08.039]  He visited Epstein at his home for a private party in Palm Beach.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:13.303]  One of the neighbors was a Tea Party member, gave me a full lowdown on everything she saw and heard.
[00:43:14.043 --> 00:43:20.268]  And then Bill Clinton also visited one of his sex parties on his private hedonistic island.
[00:43:20.328 --> 00:43:22.670]  That's right, he goes to the Pito Island.
[00:43:23.905 --> 00:43:24.185]  Yes.
[00:43:24.786 --> 00:43:30.710]  So the question really becomes, quite simply, what was Bill Clinton doing there?
[00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:34.293]  Why was he palling around with a convicted pedophile?
[00:43:34.633 --> 00:43:46.182]  The Palm Beach City Police, pardon me, the Palm Beach County Police, Sheriff's Office and Police, determined that Epstein had assaulted 33 underage girls in the county.
[00:43:46.963 --> 00:43:50.846]  He pled to one count of solicitation.
[00:43:51.587 --> 00:43:53.028]  When there was a public uproar,
[00:43:53.695 --> 00:43:54.175]  Over that.
[00:44:08.291 --> 00:44:08.851]  That's right.
[00:44:30.041 --> 00:44:38.849]  They know full well you guys have been planning to go up against Hillary with this very Epstein information, which you've already been doing here for a year.
[00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:41.572]  But now they know your phones are tapped.
[00:44:41.652 --> 00:44:45.235]  Last week you saw them breaking into your computer, surfing around on it, clicking on things.
[00:44:45.635 --> 00:44:52.242]  And so the perfect way to not let you use this weapon of truth is to just put a hoax out saying it's Trump.
[00:44:52.822 --> 00:44:56.704]  So that when Trump tries to go after him for this, they go, wait a minute, that's you.
[00:44:56.764 --> 00:44:57.965]  But I think they miscalculate.
[00:44:58.385 --> 00:45:02.567]  I would predict that Trump's going to go wild now, all guns and bring everything out.
[00:45:02.607 --> 00:45:05.208]  Is that an accurate statement, knowing his personality?
[00:45:05.328 --> 00:45:09.870]  Well, he's put out an emphatic statement, Alex, and that's all he really should dignify this crap with.
[00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:15.653]  I mean, he put out an indignant, categorical statement.
[00:45:15.753 --> 00:45:18.735]  Look, I knew Trump in this time period.
[00:45:18.815 --> 00:45:19.555]  It's just not him.
[00:45:20.439 --> 00:45:22.460]  He is just, you know, that's just not him.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.541]  He would have no interest in underage girls.
[00:45:25.681 --> 00:45:27.702]  I know the age range that he likes them.
[00:45:28.582 --> 00:45:30.403]  He's got the greatest wife in the world.
[00:45:30.423 --> 00:45:35.465]  Let's just say he likes the full goddess woman, powerful, the nine yards.
[00:45:36.185 --> 00:45:38.346]  He wants the big enchilada.
[00:45:39.446 --> 00:45:40.507]  Let's just be very clear.
[00:45:40.587 --> 00:45:42.308]  Jeffrey Epstein's youngest victim was 13.
[00:45:42.348 --> 00:45:44.588]  Some of the girls were 17.
[00:45:44.709 --> 00:45:46.629]  Now, Trump would have no interest in that.
[00:45:46.649 --> 00:45:48.270]  In fact, he would find it disgusting.
[00:45:49.182 --> 00:45:51.364]  He's a father and a family man.
[00:45:51.664 --> 00:45:54.226]  So this is a ridiculous hoax.
[00:45:55.167 --> 00:45:57.229]  An attempt to smear the frontrunner.
[00:45:57.269 --> 00:46:01.032]  This guy threatens to bust up the entire party duopoly.
[00:46:02.313 --> 00:46:07.857]  The Wall Street, K Street axis that has been running this country.
[00:46:08.037 --> 00:46:09.719]  I've never seen this kind of fear.
[00:46:09.819 --> 00:46:10.920]  The smear tactic.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.622]  The incredible attack.
[00:46:14.342 --> 00:46:15.003]  It's absurd.
[00:46:15.794 --> 00:46:16.975]  Well, thank you for this exclusive.
[00:46:16.995 --> 00:46:18.576]  I know you're working so hard on the campaign.
[00:46:18.596 --> 00:46:23.139]  In the last two minutes here, Roger Stone, StoneZone.com, StopTheSteal.org.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.902]  How big a victory have we seen going forward?
[00:46:26.922 --> 00:46:27.982]  The momentum is clear.
[00:46:28.002 --> 00:46:33.506]  Now they're saying even if it gets to, you know, the 237, they're going to, or the 1237, they're going to ignore that.
[00:46:33.947 --> 00:46:36.548]  I mean, I think their hubris is bitten off more than it can chew.
[00:46:37.169 --> 00:46:41.412]  What can you say about the state of the Trump campaign and this campaign and the country right now?
[00:46:42.987 --> 00:46:52.776]  Well, unfortunately the establishment continues to nibble around the edges of Trump's majority, packing the state delegations with Trojan horse delegates.
[00:46:52.816 --> 00:46:55.278]  We saw more of them placed in Georgia last week.
[00:46:56.579 --> 00:46:59.822]  Indiana has a primary, which I think Trump will win smashingly.
[00:47:00.303 --> 00:47:03.105]  He will have one delegate under the current system.
[00:47:03.305 --> 00:47:03.466]  One!
[00:47:04.006 --> 00:47:08.150]  And those delegates will not be forced to vote the will of the voters by party rules.
[00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:09.191]  Will they do so?
[00:47:11.796 --> 00:47:13.537]  So that is what we're up against.
[00:47:13.577 --> 00:47:15.799]  Donald Trump can win huge victories.
[00:47:16.119 --> 00:47:18.340]  When I say we, I say this as a Trump supporter.
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:22.002]  Because all of my actions on behalf of Donald Trump are independent.
[00:47:22.462 --> 00:47:24.484]  I have no affiliation with this campaign.
[00:47:24.944 --> 00:47:26.985]  I have no formal or informal role.
[00:47:27.848 --> 00:47:29.470]  I've known Donald Trump 40 years.
[00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:31.573]  I have great affection for his family.
[00:47:31.593 --> 00:47:33.615]  I've seen the great things he's achieved.
[00:47:34.035 --> 00:47:36.118]  And I think he's the only one for you with a special interest.
[00:47:36.138 --> 00:47:40.302]  But I want to be clear, Alex, that I am just a commando out there in the field.
[00:47:40.583 --> 00:47:41.063]  I understand.
[00:47:41.083 --> 00:47:42.104]  You're going to the sound of the guns.
[00:47:42.665 --> 00:47:54.415]  Knowing his psychology, and myself just watching him, but you knowing him so well, I understand he's not going to respond to this anymore, but I would expect him to get really aggressive now, because every time they do something even close to this, he really fires back.
[00:47:54.435 --> 00:47:58.518]  So I think we're going to start hearing about Bill Clinton, the rapist from Trump, here on the campaign trail.
[00:47:58.799 --> 00:47:59.299]  What do you think?
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:06.205]  Well, I don't think he will open up on Hillary until an appropriate time, and he wants to be the nominee.
[00:48:06.245 --> 00:48:07.846]  Right now, he's the presumptive nominee.
[00:48:07.886 --> 00:48:08.567]  I agree with that.
[00:48:09.047 --> 00:48:10.869]  There is no mathematical way
[00:48:11.587 --> 00:48:18.089]  For Ted Cruz to get there, but Alex, choosing Carly Fiorina, she's Mitt Romney in heels.
[00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:35.716]  I mean, layoffs, outsourcing, giant golden parachute while she's firing people, then she gets caught red-handed essentially violating the Iranian sanctions so Hewlett-Packard can do business in Iran.
[00:48:36.316 --> 00:48:40.218]  Chief Domestic Policy Advisor for cranky John McCain.
[00:48:41.421 --> 00:48:43.962]  This is a Hail Mary pass that makes no sense.
[00:48:44.582 --> 00:48:56.345]  Not only that, but because she ran for the Senate in California, and because the Democrats willfully excoriated her on all those issues, her negatives in California are sky high.
[00:48:56.405 --> 00:48:59.866]  They know what Carly Fiorina is, a globalist lackey.
[00:49:00.669 --> 00:49:01.970]  Uh, who has run a failed company.
[00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:03.131]  So, a very stupid move.
[00:49:03.171 --> 00:49:05.813]  And the media keeps saying, Trump needs to quit complaining about the big steal.
[00:49:05.873 --> 00:49:09.976]  No, he needs to always talk about it so the delegates themselves fight back and say no.
[00:49:10.336 --> 00:49:14.039]  And I can really see the fact that you pointed out to him he needs to go after the Sanders people.
[00:49:14.319 --> 00:49:15.140]  He's doing that now.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.861]  Roger Stone, have a great weekend.
[00:49:16.881 --> 00:49:17.642]  We'll talk to you soon.
[00:49:17.682 --> 00:49:18.142]  Thank you, sir.
[00:49:19.343 --> 00:49:20.284]  Final point, Alex.
[00:49:21.084 --> 00:49:26.208]  Uh, please, activists, lovers of liberty, patriots, come Cleveland.
[00:49:26.775 --> 00:49:28.596]  We need you badly in Cleveland.
[00:49:28.636 --> 00:49:32.599]  We are building the greatest outdoor protest in Cleveland history.
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:33.320]  It's history.
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:34.461]  Commit and be there.
[00:49:34.541 --> 00:49:35.322]  Commit and be there.
[00:49:36.302 --> 00:49:37.043]  Please, we need you.
[00:49:37.063 --> 00:49:38.584]  If you have to sleep in the tent, do it.
[00:49:39.385 --> 00:49:40.325]  Housing is scarce.
[00:49:40.385 --> 00:49:41.526]  We're trying to work on that.
[00:49:41.546 --> 00:49:43.608]  We're working on a system of buses.
[00:49:43.628 --> 00:49:49.993]  So even if you can't go, please go to the website, give us $25 so someone can go in your place.
[00:49:50.073 --> 00:49:50.453]  Absolutely.
[00:49:50.473 --> 00:49:52.835]  There's a lot of people who want to go but need transportation.
[00:49:53.462 --> 00:49:54.422]  Folks, it is your duty.
[00:49:54.442 --> 00:49:55.903]  You want to march on Washington.
[00:49:55.943 --> 00:49:57.683]  This is the march to restore the Republic.
[00:49:58.003 --> 00:50:00.144]  The real battle is in Cleveland, not in D.C.
[00:50:00.424 --> 00:50:04.705]  Roger Strone, we'll see you soon via Skype and soon in person in Cleveland.
[00:50:04.745 --> 00:50:05.185]  God bless.
[00:50:05.205 --> 00:50:06.405]  Many thanks.
[00:50:06.445 --> 00:50:16.608]  We're going to go to break now, folks, and come back and get more into the news surrounding the riots last night, the vicious attacks on Trump supporters, the media has tried to cover up briefly.
[00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:19.372]  The whole world is destabilizing.
[00:50:19.432 --> 00:50:20.513]  The globalists are digging in.
[00:50:20.694 --> 00:50:22.676]  Armored vehicles, machine guns, storable food.
[00:50:22.716 --> 00:50:24.118]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[00:50:24.238 --> 00:50:25.901]  You've heard the expert guests we've had on.
[00:50:26.001 --> 00:50:26.862]  I hope you don't need it.
[00:50:26.942 --> 00:50:27.663]  I hope I don't need it.
[00:50:27.843 --> 00:50:32.229]  But I'm getting more storable food, medical supplies, ammo, you name it, myself.
[00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:35.373]  So I'm trying to save the country politically, fighting on.
[00:50:35.954 --> 00:50:37.234]  On another front, I'm getting ready myself.
[00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:38.935]  The sale is going to have to end.
[00:50:38.955 --> 00:50:39.875]  They want me to end it tonight.
[00:50:40.075 --> 00:50:43.836]  I think we're going to end it probably Sunday or so, but it will be over by Monday.
[00:50:44.176 --> 00:50:45.316]  Mega sale ends.
[00:50:46.016 --> 00:50:46.857]  You need to take advantage.

[00:51:19.256 --> 00:51:27.383]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:51:27.663 --> 00:51:32.366]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:51:32.526 --> 00:51:39.251]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:51:39.331 --> 00:51:46.396]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:51:46.496 --> 00:51:53.380]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:57.483]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:51:57.483 --> 00:52:01.265]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:52:01.285 --> 00:52:03.086]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:52:03.286 --> 00:52:10.530]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:52:24.537 --> 00:52:27.879]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:38.487]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:52:38.687 --> 00:52:45.932]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:52:46.152 --> 00:52:48.052]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:52:48.392 --> 00:52:56.054]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:52:56.354 --> 00:53:02.515]  Super Mill Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:53:02.816 --> 00:53:09.737]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mill Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:53:10.117 --> 00:53:11.639]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:53:12.039 --> 00:53:17.964]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:53:18.185 --> 00:53:32.358]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights,
[00:53:32.938 --> 00:53:34.859]  We're focusing on fighting the globalists.
[00:53:35.259 --> 00:53:43.083]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:53:43.283 --> 00:53:45.884]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated.
[00:53:46.104 --> 00:53:47.645]  My muscle mass increased.
[00:53:47.845 --> 00:53:50.426]  My stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:53:50.706 --> 00:53:56.449]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:59.670]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge.
[00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:05.272]  If they began to yell at me, the traitor, the traitor, and somebody just tried to yank the car away from me, thank God,
[00:54:29.111 --> 00:54:31.974]  A really good fella, an American came and was like, no, the Americans are with you!
[00:54:32.014 --> 00:54:36.718]  And suddenly, like, there was a bunch of people around me, like, yeah, I just keep yelling at them.
[00:54:37.358 --> 00:54:38.139]  But they were shocked.
[00:54:38.159 --> 00:54:43.944]  They were shocked that somebody in Spanish, and because they cannot tell me racist, they were out.
[00:54:44.264 --> 00:54:47.186]  It was funny to see their faces just like, oh, he's screaming in Spanish.
[00:54:47.246 --> 00:54:47.667]  Like, ugh.
[00:54:48.247 --> 00:54:50.429]  But it's still like, it was like that.
[00:54:50.489 --> 00:54:52.931]  Yeah, and I see these people with the Mexican flags.
[00:54:53.011 --> 00:54:54.092]  This is graceful.
[00:54:54.172 --> 00:54:54.793]  Come on, man.
[00:54:55.113 --> 00:54:56.254]  I'm part of this land now.
[00:54:56.374 --> 00:54:56.835]  I love it.
[00:54:59.113 --> 00:55:04.596]  And that's Rob Dew there on the scene getting interviews with folks that went through all of that.
[00:55:05.357 --> 00:55:07.058]  So, continue.
[00:55:07.098 --> 00:55:10.180]  We got more reporters about to land out there to back him up as well.
[00:55:11.881 --> 00:55:19.685]  But imagine people waving Mexican flags because you want to go to a political rally and trying to drive over you with cars and beating people up.
[00:55:20.226 --> 00:55:27.330]  A bunch of Black Lives Matter, black supremacist, goofy social justice warrior people just out there filled with so much hate.
[00:55:28.564 --> 00:55:33.186]  And they really go after Hispanics that, like, are supposedly these traitors to Mexico.
[00:55:33.646 --> 00:55:36.528]  If Mexico's so wonderful, why are you here?
[00:55:36.928 --> 00:55:38.548]  And I'm not saying we're that wonderful either.
[00:55:38.588 --> 00:55:42.230]  We're falling apart, but... It's just crazy.
[00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:44.191]  It's absolute garbage.
[00:55:44.231 --> 00:55:45.091]  It's brainwashing.
[00:55:45.171 --> 00:55:45.992]  It's out of control.
[00:55:46.917 --> 00:56:00.613]  Meanwhile, multinational corporations that own our big insurance companies, in the first year of Obamacare two years ago, according to the Wall Street Journal, had a global 47 plus percent increase in profit in one year.
[00:56:01.274 --> 00:56:03.116]  All insurance companies globally
[00:56:05.814 --> 00:56:11.218]  Off the raping and robbing of us and increasing prices, globally saw a 47% increase.
[00:56:11.558 --> 00:56:12.819]  It went up even more the next year.
[00:56:13.579 --> 00:56:15.000]  My dad's insurance doubled.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.661]  Mine has doubled the last two years.
[00:56:18.082 --> 00:56:25.628]  Member Gruber, who helped write it up with Obama, he said, yes, thank God the public's dumb and doesn't pay attention, we're doubling and tripling prices!
[00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:29.010]  There was always free health care for poor people.
[00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:30.351]  There was always charity care.
[00:56:31.610 --> 00:56:33.931]  Now they just call that Obamacare.
[00:56:34.751 --> 00:56:38.273]  So again, the total ignorance is how they manipulate.
[00:56:38.553 --> 00:56:41.754]  Significant premium hikes expected under Obama health law.
[00:56:42.334 --> 00:56:45.876]  That's already gone up repeatedly, but this is out of the Associated Press.
[00:56:46.756 --> 00:56:55.840]  Expect insurers to seek significant premium increases under President Obama's health care law in a wave of state-level requests rippling across the country ahead of the political conventions this summer.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:05.984]  Insurers say the law coverage has been a financial drain for many of them, and they're setting the stage for 2017 hikes that in some cases could reach well into the double digits.
[00:57:06.864 --> 00:57:08.565]  Oh, isn't that sweet?
[00:57:09.586 --> 00:57:12.487]  International control over local state systems.
[00:57:13.817 --> 00:57:18.420]  But don't worry, Bloomberg columnist says Trump is America's first Nazi.
[00:57:19.381 --> 00:57:22.023]  He says America's first is Nazi rhetoric, really?
[00:57:22.263 --> 00:57:25.525]  And the EU's criticizing Trump that was a Nazi project.
[00:57:27.526 --> 00:57:31.769]  Don't you love the total ignorance of how they operate and how they behave?
[00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:38.234]  Again, the world is degenerating and the best time to get storable food, high quality storable food, is now.
[00:57:39.209 --> 00:57:41.152]  This special ends this weekend.
[00:57:41.172 --> 00:57:42.293]  I'm not sure when this weekend.
[00:57:42.634 --> 00:57:45.918]  There's a certain point we're not going to completely run out of the fresh food that's just been produced.
[00:57:45.938 --> 00:57:48.441]  We're not going to make folks wait two weeks till more gets produced.
[00:57:49.785 --> 00:57:54.209]  So we're going to cut off the 30 to 40 percent off and go back to the regular incredibly low price.
[00:57:54.289 --> 00:57:59.474]  The packaging is incredible for transport, special meals, special diets, full spectrum.
[00:57:59.995 --> 00:58:05.080]  It's MyPatriot Supply, private label by us, so that we can contractually lower the price even more.
[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:11.566]  Infowarsstore.com or infowarsselect.com or you can also buy the MyPatriot full spectrum right there at infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:12.006 --> 00:58:24.250]  Get free shipping on any order above $50, I should also add, and get 10% off on anything you sign up for, for auto-ship, like DNA Force, Anthroplex, Super Mel Vitality, Brain Force.
[00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:27.331]  And we never run out of folks that are signed up for auto-ship.
[00:58:27.651 --> 00:58:31.672]  We never sell out because we hold back enough for folks that are on auto-ship.
[00:58:31.692 --> 00:58:33.513]  So that's a little inside baseball secret.
[00:58:33.793 --> 00:58:34.833]  Anthroplex is back.
[00:58:35.153 --> 00:58:37.594]  Super Mel Vitality will sell out by this weekend.
[00:58:38.669 --> 00:58:41.892]  And there are so many other great products available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:42.332 --> 00:58:48.978]  By the way, we put giant promo codes in for anybody that signed up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:58:49.158 --> 00:58:50.259]  We'll be back with a second hour.
[00:58:50.279 --> 00:58:50.679]  Stay with us.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:53.582]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:54.442 --> 00:58:55.803]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:01.346 --> 00:59:04.748]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:12.233]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:59:12.854 --> 00:59:21.239]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:25.582]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:59:25.882 --> 00:59:31.046]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:59:31.466 --> 00:59:35.388]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:59:35.709 --> 00:59:38.910]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:50.217]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:59:50.257 --> 00:59:52.938]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[00:59:53.178 --> 00:59:59.122]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[01:00:02.513 --> 01:00:06.616]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:16.362]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:29.806 --> 01:00:37.971]  You know, I knew that our reporters were going out to California yesterday, but I've gotten so busy that I saw all these articles.
[01:00:39.071 --> 01:00:44.075]  I didn't realize it was exclusive InfoWars videos that are up on DrudgeReport.com and everywhere else.
[01:00:44.115 --> 01:00:45.776]  I thought we were just writing about stuff.
[01:00:45.816 --> 01:00:48.037]  I thought our crew was getting to the rallies today.
[01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:53.180]  They flew in, I guess, yesterday, got there, and are the ones that got all the exclusive footage.
[01:00:54.141 --> 01:00:56.142]  So I was like, hey, that's Rob Dew's voice.
[01:00:56.182 --> 01:00:56.922]  We're playing the video.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:04.004]  I hadn't really paid attention when I was watching the videos this morning that it was Rob Doo and Joe Biggs and people.
[01:01:04.945 --> 01:01:10.590]  So, Trump Nazi sign holder gets owned.
[01:01:12.892 --> 01:01:15.734]  Bernie supporters dance and destroy at Trump rally.
[01:01:16.935 --> 01:01:18.056]  They're uploading all this right now.
[01:01:18.757 --> 01:01:21.279]  Latino for Trump reveals horrors of socialism.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.042]  Trump supporters, protesters face off.
[01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:30.273]  Trump supporters unload on mob mentality.
[01:01:33.295 --> 01:01:35.036]  House of Cards begins to fail.
[01:01:35.537 --> 01:01:37.238]  Anti-Trump riot quelled.
[01:01:38.359 --> 01:01:40.601]  Riot cops march on Bernie supporters.
[01:01:41.482 --> 01:01:48.948]  These are all great headlines, but the headline is... Anti-Trump thugs attack peaceful families.
[01:01:49.148 --> 01:01:49.869]  I mean, that's what happened.
[01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:52.511]  Trump supporter bloodied by Trump thugs.
[01:01:53.191 --> 01:01:55.193]  Anti-Trump zealots pushed back.
[01:01:57.776 --> 01:02:04.318]  Well, it's anti-Trump attackers successfully repulsed, anti-free speech horde defeated.
[01:02:04.338 --> 01:02:11.880]  And you see, when the police in different cities have attacked peaceful crowds, I'm totally against it.
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:13.560]  And I say, indict them, arrest them, whatever.
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:19.882]  But when there's peaceful crowds and they're attacked, and then the police go and defend the right of free speech, that's a good thing.
[01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:27.832]  Against people waving foreign flags and, I mean, literally hopping around, people that act just like Trigley Puff.
[01:02:29.493 --> 01:02:32.355]  I mean, I was looking at Trigley Puff last night, who I do want to reach out to and have her come here.
[01:02:32.395 --> 01:02:33.355]  I said, look at you!
[01:02:34.396 --> 01:02:39.139]  You're like a baby throwing a fit about people's free speech and just screaming everybody's racist.
[01:02:39.199 --> 01:02:41.261]  So, you know, it's like some title you have.
[01:02:42.574 --> 01:02:43.835]  This is culture war, folks.
[01:02:44.356 --> 01:02:45.556]  This is total divide and conquer.
[01:02:45.577 --> 01:02:46.357]  I see right through it.
[01:02:46.397 --> 01:02:49.199]  And they're funding all the white supremacist groups on the other side.
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:52.822]  Pro-Trump Hispanics to tell racist hate from protesters.
[01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:56.926]  I mean, there's just a bunch of powerful videos.
[01:02:56.946 --> 01:02:58.327]  The crew's done an amazing job.
[01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:03.912]  Trump supporters brave mob of illegal aliens.
[01:03:03.972 --> 01:03:06.113]  I just add that to the headline there.
[01:03:06.153 --> 01:03:07.655]  Whoever's listening to the crew, just please.
[01:03:09.548 --> 01:03:12.249]  Trump supporters defend free speech, brave mob of illegals.
[01:03:12.949 --> 01:03:14.730]  They're waving Mexican flags, folks.
[01:03:15.110 --> 01:03:16.751]  They don't want to be here, I know that.
[01:03:17.291 --> 01:03:18.912]  Like a foreign invasion force, whatever.
[01:03:18.932 --> 01:03:23.894]  Imagine if I was in Mexico running around waving an American flag trying to stop some political demonstration.
[01:03:24.514 --> 01:03:31.217]  Imagine if it was some presidential candidate giving a speech in Mexico City and I showed up with like 50 Americans.
[01:03:32.406 --> 01:03:34.448]  White, black, Hispanics were trying to beat people up.
[01:03:34.588 --> 01:03:35.348]  You'd get killed!
[01:03:36.829 --> 01:03:37.850]  You would get killed!
[01:03:38.371 --> 01:03:39.371]  And you probably should be!
[01:03:39.511 --> 01:03:41.133]  I mean, you know, it's just crazy!
[01:03:42.093 --> 01:03:46.497]  How this country's like, and I know, oh, Mexico belonged to, I mean, California belonged to Mexico.
[01:03:47.718 --> 01:03:49.259]  And it belonged to the Russians, too.
[01:03:49.279 --> 01:03:53.022]  I mean, Texas had eight flags over it, not just six or seven.
[01:03:53.842 --> 01:03:55.043]  It was a war zone.
[01:03:55.284 --> 01:03:57.005]  It belonged to the poor Native Americans.
[01:03:57.385 --> 01:03:59.487]  Do you know what Native Americans lived in Texas?
[01:03:59.907 --> 01:04:01.969]  And I'm not bashing them, I'm related to some of them.
[01:04:03.413 --> 01:04:12.479]  The Karankawas on the coast that were headhunters and killed anybody they got a hold of that were feared all over the place, and then the Comanches.
[01:04:13.499 --> 01:04:21.064]  There weren't a lot of Apaches in Texas, there were some out west, but anywhere that had good land, good forest, the Comanches ran the show.
[01:04:21.825 --> 01:04:24.226]  All the way up through Oklahoma, all the way up into the Dakotas.
[01:04:24.907 --> 01:04:32.312]  The most vicious, undoubted most powerful and warlike of any native tribe.
[01:04:33.226 --> 01:04:33.867]  The Comanches.
[01:04:34.607 --> 01:04:36.529]  That's who ran Texas.
[01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:39.211]  The Comanches and the Karankawa.
[01:04:39.711 --> 01:04:40.992]  That's who ran it.
[01:04:41.153 --> 01:04:45.216]  That's people that would roast you over a fire and eat you.
[01:04:46.157 --> 01:04:52.302]  The Comanches would cut your eyelids off and bury you in an ant bed for enjoyment while they took hallucinogens.
[01:04:54.292 --> 01:04:55.413]  Maybe that's why I'm so crazy.
[01:04:55.993 --> 01:04:57.414]  A little bit of Comanche, not much.
[01:04:57.915 --> 01:05:00.316]  Mainly just good old Sweetie Pie.
[01:05:00.616 --> 01:05:02.298]  You know, folks out of Oklahoma.
[01:05:02.318 --> 01:05:08.262]  But I tell you, it is just so... The image they put out of Native Americans is pure and total bull.
[01:05:10.563 --> 01:05:11.584]  Brain Force is here.
[01:05:12.124 --> 01:05:14.386]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:05:14.666 --> 01:05:20.330]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports.
[01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:22.472]  And it's because of Brain Force.
[01:05:23.243 --> 01:05:26.385]  One of the worst things with most energy products, this is not sustainable.
[01:05:26.686 --> 01:05:26.826]  Right?
[01:05:26.846 --> 01:05:29.188]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[01:05:29.548 --> 01:05:33.071]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[01:05:33.111 --> 01:05:36.253]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[01:05:36.753 --> 01:05:41.557]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[01:05:42.098 --> 01:05:43.939]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[01:05:44.279 --> 01:05:48.703]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[01:05:48.863 --> 01:05:50.884]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[01:05:51.485 --> 01:05:52.966]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[01:05:53.106 --> 01:05:53.346]  Exactly.
[01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:57.168]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[01:05:57.668 --> 01:06:05.652]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:19.399]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:27.568]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:06:27.868 --> 01:06:32.570]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:39.472]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:39.532 --> 01:06:46.615]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:06:46.715 --> 01:06:53.577]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:06:53.737 --> 01:06:58.081]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:10.111]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:08:24.059 --> 01:08:31.361]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:35.302 --> 01:08:38.623]  Bernie Sanders wants to audit the private federal reserve.
[01:08:38.683 --> 01:08:42.244]  Bernie Sanders thinks it's wrong that big elites are basically tax exempt.
[01:08:42.284 --> 01:08:42.804]  I agree with him.
[01:08:43.544 --> 01:08:47.305]  I don't think socialism is the way to go because the elites always get control of that pie.
[01:08:48.575 --> 01:08:51.058]  But the so-called system we have is not capitalism.
[01:08:51.078 --> 01:08:55.322]  It is crony capitalism to the 10th power.
[01:08:55.382 --> 01:08:57.524]  It is a criminal operation.
[01:08:58.546 --> 01:09:08.256]  And it's seeking to turn the entire West and the rest of the world into giant compartmentalized warring factions that they control.
[01:09:11.533 --> 01:09:21.738]  Now, Cynthia McKinney, former congresswoman, has been demonized so much by the left and the right, and they literally put a congressman in to take her place who thinks that islands float.
[01:09:21.778 --> 01:09:22.238]  Remember that?
[01:09:22.759 --> 01:09:23.159]  That guy?
[01:09:23.619 --> 01:09:24.599]  That's who they replaced her with.
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:26.941]  He thought that Guam would capsize.
[01:09:27.721 --> 01:09:39.487]  Because she would get up there and talk about the child kidnapping rings that were in the Chicago Tribune with DynCorp, and men, women, and children being disappeared, and vaccine deaths in the troops.
[01:09:42.179 --> 01:09:42.959]  That's why they went after her.
[01:09:43.039 --> 01:09:48.180]  And that's why they claimed that she would get in fights with the Capitol cops when they were ordered to harass her.
[01:09:49.581 --> 01:09:52.441]  Because of what she actually stood for, because she had courage.
[01:09:53.602 --> 01:09:55.142]  And that's why they're scared of Bernie Sanders.
[01:09:55.162 --> 01:09:56.322]  That's why they're scared of Donald Trump.
[01:09:56.342 --> 01:09:58.483]  That's why they're scared of her.
[01:09:58.523 --> 01:10:00.263]  They're scared of anybody they don't control.
[01:10:00.303 --> 01:10:06.044]  That's why you have the Communist Chinese that Mao Zedong, according to the Chinese Communists, killed 84 million people.
[01:10:06.364 --> 01:10:08.565]  CIA says 60-something, but they're the ones that put him in.
[01:10:09.807 --> 01:10:11.528]  You've got them saying we can't have Donald Trump.
[01:10:11.568 --> 01:10:15.231]  I've got big problems with Donald Trump, with his spying and torture and all the rest of it.
[01:10:15.251 --> 01:10:20.695]  But the point is, they don't like him because he doesn't want war with Russia, he doesn't want unfair trade deals, they're coming after him.
[01:10:21.036 --> 01:10:30.002]  And that's really the biggest seal of approval you can find, the red badge of courage, is if the establishment across the political spectrum hates you.
[01:10:31.183 --> 01:10:36.107]  The mainstream media has a 6% believability, according to the Associated Press just two weeks ago.
[01:10:36.547 --> 01:10:38.529]  I know I'm hammering that point, but it's so important.
[01:10:40.461 --> 01:10:42.863]  And so she's been the Green Party candidate.
[01:10:42.943 --> 01:10:46.765]  She's gone all over the world to war zones when Libya is getting bombed and Syria.
[01:10:46.785 --> 01:10:48.006]  She just has incredible courage.
[01:10:48.026 --> 01:10:49.727]  A lot more courage than I got.
[01:10:49.747 --> 01:10:53.109]  I mean, quite frankly, I got the courage to do it, but I don't want to get killed.
[01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:54.650]  I want to keep doing my work here.
[01:10:55.511 --> 01:10:57.032]  But she goes into war zones, you name it.
[01:10:57.853 --> 01:10:59.073]  RunCynthiaRun.org.
[01:11:00.154 --> 01:11:05.540]  She's also a doctor, I guess she does a whole bunch of political science, you name it, and she knows her stuff.
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:13.710]  And I'm always trying to get her on the show, she's really busy, but she reached out to us and so did another gentleman that's going to be on for part of the interview with us coming up.
[01:11:13.730 --> 01:11:14.711]  We're going to kind of, you know,
[01:11:15.031 --> 01:11:16.652]  Have the interviews overlap with each other.
[01:11:17.313 --> 01:11:20.315]  And of course, that gentleman was formerly with the CIA.
[01:11:20.575 --> 01:11:24.798]  Not just one of these analysts, but an actual field commander who himself carried out false flags.
[01:11:25.098 --> 01:11:27.480]  Now, not false flags killing people, but still false flags.
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:31.383]  And so Robert David Steele is going to be joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:11:31.423 --> 01:11:32.824]  They'll both be on together for 30 minutes.
[01:11:33.124 --> 01:11:35.686]  Then she'll leave and he'll be on with us for 30 minutes of the next hour.
[01:11:36.026 --> 01:11:38.568]  Then Rob Dew out there covering the people attacking.
[01:11:39.048 --> 01:11:42.050]  The Trump events will be joining us from the ground.
[01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:45.113]  The video they shot last night will be in San Francisco this evening.
[01:11:45.133 --> 01:11:48.656]  The video they shot last night is all over CNN, Fox, you name it.
[01:11:49.356 --> 01:11:51.238]  And they crop it and don't even give us credit.
[01:11:52.381 --> 01:11:52.961]  I don't even care.
[01:11:53.041 --> 01:12:04.084]  The point is, is that we're there to get this information out, and that's what your support, and all of you spreading the word about the broadcast, and buying the products, and InfowarsStore.com, you name it, it makes it all possible.
[01:12:04.465 --> 01:12:13.647]  So thank you so much for helping us build a true, independent, libertarian-based, nationalist, constitutionalist, pro-human organization.
[01:12:14.267 --> 01:12:15.828]  We are the anti-eugenics party.
[01:12:16.508 --> 01:12:18.289]  We are the anti-technocracy party.
[01:12:18.549 --> 01:12:21.791]  We're pro-technology, anti-technotronic takeover.
[01:12:22.151 --> 01:12:26.213]  And folks, if you don't know what that is, learn quickly, because that's the real system we're going under.
[01:12:27.728 --> 01:12:31.091]  So Cynthia McKinney joins us, all things CynthiaMcKinney.com.
[01:12:31.111 --> 01:12:36.076]  She's got a couple of websites, I'm not sure which one we should give out, but Dr. McKinney, it is great to have you on with us.
[01:12:36.116 --> 01:12:50.030]  I know that you originally wanted to pop on about Beyonce, and my point is this NFL, CIA funded, that's been admitted, Pentagon funded, her message, where it looks like it's empowering, in my view, is meant to get people at each other's throats, to cause division.
[01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:57.976]  To cause war on the streets while we're looted by the controllers and you wanted to pop on and give your view on this and more of us.
[01:12:57.996 --> 01:13:04.622]  I know you're an expert for being inside it, but also from studying it on the type of psychological warfare going on.
[01:13:04.682 --> 01:13:06.444]  So, Dr. McKinney, thanks for joining us.
[01:13:08.105 --> 01:13:09.386]  Well, thank you so much, Alex.
[01:13:13.945 --> 01:13:15.927]  I'm sorry, we've been having so many Skype problems lately.
[01:13:15.947 --> 01:13:18.229]  We may have to start abandoning Skype in just a moment.
[01:13:18.249 --> 01:13:19.670]  Let me just stop you for a moment, Cynthia.
[01:13:20.331 --> 01:13:22.653]  Guys, let's get her on the phone or whatever we need to do, all right?
[01:13:23.153 --> 01:13:24.514]  We probably have to abandon Skype here.
[01:13:24.534 --> 01:13:28.357]  I don't know if it's system-wide in the country or if it's here, but it's with every person.
[01:13:29.018 --> 01:13:31.220]  Let's see if we can hear her now, and if not, we're going to get her on the phone.
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:31.800]  Go ahead, Cynthia.
[01:13:33.502 --> 01:13:41.429]  Okay, I'm just saying that I'm so happy that you are having me on the show, and I hope that I'm coming through now.
[01:13:43.386 --> 01:13:44.668]  Yes, you are coming through.
[01:13:44.688 --> 01:13:46.750]  I mean, I really think they're starting to mess with us.
[01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:52.235]  Roger Stone was on earlier, and when he comes on sometimes, someone jumps on his computer and is controlling the browser.
[01:13:52.255 --> 01:13:53.977]  I mean, this is really starting to happen.
[01:13:53.997 --> 01:13:56.900]  I think what we're seeing is some information warfare, but please continue.
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:57.421]  I apologize.
[01:13:59.195 --> 01:14:09.010]  Well, the situation with Trump and the riot that took place, let me first say, I'm not in the United States.
[01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:13.557]  For the past two weeks, I've been in Africa and I've been in Asia.
[01:14:15.469 --> 01:14:24.080]  Let me tell you that people are concerned about the potential for a President Trump.
[01:14:24.581 --> 01:14:30.809]  And this stems from things that he has said or things that he has reportedly said.
[01:14:32.771 --> 01:14:47.346]  At the same time, let me just remind folks that if you run a draw play too many times, then the defense is going to be able to tell when you're running a draw play.
[01:14:47.907 --> 01:14:55.514]  Now, this situation with the riot at the campaign event, well, I'm here to tell you
[01:14:56.195 --> 01:15:00.057]  That this happened in my very own campaign.
[01:15:00.077 --> 01:15:00.698]  I remember.
[01:15:00.938 --> 01:15:02.779]  This happened actually twice.
[01:15:03.559 --> 01:15:23.110]  And so one time, the first time it happened, homeless people were told that I was giving away money and all they had to do was come to my campaign headquarters and collect a check, collect some cash.
[01:15:24.601 --> 01:15:37.812]  And, of course, people... Alright, we're having Skype problems with Cynthia McKinney.
[01:15:37.832 --> 01:15:40.694]  She's getting into dirty tricks, how these type of operations run.
[01:15:40.714 --> 01:15:45.158]  When her Skype comes back, we'll attempt to go to her, and then at break, we're going to attempt to get on a phone line with her.
[01:15:45.178 --> 01:15:48.941]  She's in Bangladesh, so that may be the reason we're having some Skype problems.
[01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:51.403]  But with Roger Stone, they've been breaking into his computers.
[01:15:51.423 --> 01:15:52.544]  Of course, he's one of the top
[01:15:53.064 --> 01:15:54.705]  Trump advisors, so what do you expect?
[01:15:54.745 --> 01:15:58.567]  I mean, he's the frontrunner of the so-called free world and they're really coming after him.
[01:15:59.227 --> 01:16:02.148]  And absolutely, Trump does some things I disagree with, some things that scare people.
[01:16:02.428 --> 01:16:04.349]  The media also kind of misrepresents a lot of it.
[01:16:04.649 --> 01:16:10.532]  The bigger question I want to ask Cynthia McKinney is, why does she think the system across the board is so scared of him?
[01:16:10.552 --> 01:16:11.813]  But we'll get to that question in a moment.
[01:16:12.433 --> 01:16:14.094]  Your Skype was cutting out again, Dr. McKinney.
[01:16:14.394 --> 01:16:18.216]  You were getting into, they sent the homeless, claiming that you were offering free money.
[01:16:18.256 --> 01:16:18.816]  Please continue.
[01:16:20.769 --> 01:16:25.395]  And so eventually, I was totally embarrassed.
[01:16:25.936 --> 01:16:28.139]  All of the media were there to cover it.
[01:16:30.022 --> 01:16:32.004]  And I was totally embarrassed.
[01:16:32.105 --> 01:16:34.628]  This is exactly a replay.
[01:16:34.688 --> 01:16:37.912]  This is a not so instant replay.
[01:16:38.513 --> 01:16:39.634]  Of what happened to me.
[01:16:39.714 --> 01:16:41.074]  So I recognize it.
[01:16:41.815 --> 01:16:55.762]  And so the objective is to make Trump so unpalatable that one doesn't have any choice but to cast their vote for Hillary Clinton.
[01:16:56.523 --> 01:17:02.246]  And under no circumstance should any thinking voter vote for Hillary Clinton.
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:11.106]  Well, even Louis Farrakhan has been saying good things about Trump overall, compared to the other establishment candidates, even though he disagrees with some of the things.
[01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:13.908]  And of course, Trump obviously disagrees with some of the stuff Louis Farrakhan says.
[01:17:14.368 --> 01:17:18.331]  All I know is I've never seen the power structure so scared of somebody.
[01:17:18.371 --> 01:17:25.215]  What is your view, as somebody that's been inside Congress, but also been all over the world, Dr. McKinney, of why the system's so scared of Trump?
[01:17:28.718 --> 01:17:31.120]  Well, you know, his instincts.
[01:17:34.126 --> 01:17:36.347]  He said something that caught my attention.
[01:17:36.707 --> 01:17:40.089]  Of course, he said a lot of things that caught a lot of attention, right?
[01:17:40.289 --> 01:17:40.689]  Okay.
[01:17:41.429 --> 01:17:44.471]  However, he started talking about NATO.
[01:17:45.191 --> 01:17:48.593]  You and I know that NATO is an anachronism.
[01:17:49.073 --> 01:17:54.296]  NATO should have been dismantled a decade ago or more.
[01:17:55.709 --> 01:17:56.070]  All right.
[01:18:15.129 --> 01:18:21.816]  Keep cement together these entities that are basically drifting apart.
[01:18:22.237 --> 01:18:28.504]  If you look at what's happening in Europe today and then... Sure he also wants peace with Russia.
[01:18:28.544 --> 01:18:29.925]  I mean that is such a big positive.
[01:18:31.447 --> 01:18:31.987]  That's right.
[01:18:32.368 --> 01:18:36.632]  And so now you've got NATO has become a global
[01:18:37.615 --> 01:18:55.706]  Army to destabilize other parts of the world in pursuit of the Cold War against Russia and a hot war, it seems, against China.
[01:18:55.726 --> 01:18:57.347]  That's right.
[01:18:57.387 --> 01:19:02.250]  You were about to go to break, but you were getting into Hillary Clinton saying under no circumstances vote for her.
[01:19:03.491 --> 01:19:04.672]  Why are you against Hillary Clinton?
[01:19:07.734 --> 01:19:12.799]  I think her record speaks volumes for the kind of president that she would be.
[01:19:12.819 --> 01:19:28.616]  And I can't even imagine that we're talking about a President Hillary Clinton when we really ought to be talking about who's going to prosecute her for war crimes, torture, crimes against humanity, and crimes against the peace.
[01:19:29.428 --> 01:19:40.521]  That's right, Libya, Syria, the warmongering, the lying about being a hero like Brian Williams, all the other things she's done, and then we're just supposed to vote for her because she's a woman?
[01:19:40.541 --> 01:19:41.463]  And that's a total gimmick!
[01:19:43.132 --> 01:19:44.533]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:19:45.094 --> 01:19:55.721]  And first of all, there's a woman by the name of Jane Chirpstra who wrote a fabulous piece called Beware the Women of the Hegemon.
[01:19:56.262 --> 01:20:03.567]  And so she talks about how there was a time when women candidates for political office... Stay there, stay there.
[01:20:03.607 --> 01:20:04.268]  Cynthia McKinney.
[01:20:04.588 --> 01:20:05.369]  Dr. McKinney, stay there.
[01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:06.409]  From Bangladesh.
[01:20:06.449 --> 01:20:07.410]  Wow, didn't know she was there.
[01:20:07.951 --> 01:20:08.911]  Joining us straight ahead.
[01:20:08.931 --> 01:20:09.572]  We'll be back.
[01:20:15.370 --> 01:20:17.735]  I don't like to sit here and have to say, see I told you so.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:45.943]  I would have rather people 15 years ago listened to me when I had FBI agents on and I had other major whistleblowers on like Sabel Edmonds who was an FBI translator who in the months leading up to 9-11 heard elements of our government working with Al Qaeda and heard elements of our government basically giving orders to Al Qaeda to protect them from the US Army that was trying to hunt them down and kill them.
[01:20:46.946 --> 01:20:57.213]  We exposed them, rogue criminal elements in our government, working with Saudi Arabia, who ordered a stand down on 9-11, so that the attacks could take place.
[01:20:58.634 --> 01:21:00.796]  15 of the 19 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia.
[01:21:01.316 --> 01:21:09.182]  But Saudi Arabia's arch enemy, a country pro-Western in the past, compared to Saudi Arabia, Iraq was attacked.
[01:21:09.662 --> 01:21:10.402]  And now 15 years later,
[01:21:12.606 --> 01:21:14.851]  It's all beginning to come out.
[01:21:15.412 --> 01:21:21.044]  The New World Order, crime syndicate, above government, like Spectre out of a James Bond movie.
[01:21:22.099 --> 01:21:29.265]  Like Hydra, out of Captain America, is literally orchestrating the terror attacks and working with radical Islam.
[01:21:29.725 --> 01:21:31.627]  And the good news is, that's all coming out.
[01:21:32.167 --> 01:21:44.198]  And now Saudi Arabia, holding this country hostage, is saying, we'll pull our $750 billion of assets out of your nation and cause a depression if you release what's in that congressional report.
[01:21:45.236 --> 01:21:56.529]  Did you know that in that congressional report, they talked to hundreds of whistleblowers from the Army, the Navy, the Marines, and other agencies like the CIA and the FBI that told them exactly what happened.
[01:21:58.451 --> 01:22:00.733]  And if it ever comes out, it will bring down the bushes.
[01:22:01.803 --> 01:22:08.107]  The Clintons and the corrupt royal dictatorship of Saudi Arabia.
[01:22:08.647 --> 01:22:09.968]  That's why this is so exciting.
[01:22:10.589 --> 01:22:13.230]  To be clear, we're not singling out Saudi Arabia.
[01:22:13.351 --> 01:22:16.873]  Other governments and other criminal networks were involved, but the
[01:22:17.633 --> 01:22:23.678]  28 pages will bring down this first domino that will bring down the rest of the conspirators.
[01:22:24.278 --> 01:22:37.568]  That's why it's more important than ever that all of the great 9-11 truthers who's worked for 15 years to get the truth out, now redouble your efforts and start educating people again because we've entered the season of harvest.
[01:22:38.248 --> 01:22:46.595]  The great time of awakening when people are going to be waking up thanks to you, the patriots around the world that exposed false flag terrorism.
[01:22:47.116 --> 01:22:52.661]  And thanks to the incredible whistleblowers that in some cases, like Barry Jennings, pay the ultimate price.
[01:22:53.582 --> 01:22:58.706]  We now are on the verge of seeing the false flag inside job of 9-11 come out.
[01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:15.760]  It's important, not from an arrogant perspective, but from a teaching perspective, to go back to media and to friends and family and neighbors and co-workers that made fun of you, and throw the newspapers down in front of them and say, what did I tell you 15 years ago or 10 years ago?
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:17.320]  What did we tell you?
[01:23:17.761 --> 01:23:18.381]  We were right.
[01:23:18.801 --> 01:23:21.402]  Alex Jones specifically said Saudi Arabia.
[01:23:21.742 --> 01:23:23.723]  Specifically said NORAD stand down.
[01:23:24.123 --> 01:23:31.926]  Specifically said it was cooked up by Saudi Arabia and criminals in the Pentagon to be able to attack their enemy, Iraq, that they framed for it.
[01:23:32.327 --> 01:23:34.607]  Iraq didn't carry out 9-11.
[01:23:34.808 --> 01:23:37.108]  They were archenemies with the group that did it.
[01:23:37.549 --> 01:23:40.410]  And we owe the million-plus dead Iraqis an apology.
[01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:46.495]  Notice how the globalists hate the Iraqis, and they also hate our troops as well, and list them as the number one terror threat.
[01:23:47.195 --> 01:23:47.736]  Isn't it funny?
[01:23:48.636 --> 01:23:51.939]  We thought the war on terror was about radical Islam, now we're told it's about patriots.
[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:53.440]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:24:04.890]  Find out more about the fight for human liberty at InfoWars.com, follow us on Twitter at RealAlexJones, and it's key that you sign up for our free email news alerts at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:24:13.283 --> 01:24:16.464]  Alex Jones, you're back live.
[01:24:16.664 --> 01:24:20.744]  Dr. Cynthia McKinney, former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, is our guest.
[01:24:21.504 --> 01:24:25.285]  She'll be with us until the end of the hour, and then Robert David Steele will take over for 30 minutes.
[01:24:26.025 --> 01:24:30.966]  He's going to be joining us in the next segment as the two, I know, know each other's work.
[01:24:30.986 --> 01:24:34.787]  We'll be discussing propaganda in our media, manipulation.
[01:24:34.807 --> 01:24:40.688]  There's so many different types of it, but just here in the break, I have CNN on in the break room, and I went to get a cup of coffee.
[01:24:41.872 --> 01:24:48.095]  And Wolf Blitzer was interviewing one of the Trump campaign people, and the headline was, Violence at Trump Campaign.
[01:24:50.055 --> 01:24:53.737]  And then he was saying, Trump needs to apologize that he's causing this.
[01:24:54.597 --> 01:24:56.318]  And she's saying, but they're the ones that attacked.
[01:24:56.798 --> 01:25:00.300]  So see, it's this inversion of reality, and it's like the Egyptian government.
[01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:04.021]  I'm not defending the stuff they were doing, but we overthrow them, put people in worse.
[01:25:04.341 --> 01:25:06.162]  They start murdering tens of thousands of people.
[01:25:08.777 --> 01:25:12.678]  Syria, doing nothing to anybody, trying to overthrow them, kill hundreds of thousands.
[01:25:13.398 --> 01:25:14.398]  Libya, even worse.
[01:25:14.458 --> 01:25:18.139]  I mean, Qaddafi's been working with the West for eight years, investing all his money.
[01:25:18.539 --> 01:25:21.480]  He was basically putting 98% of the government money back to the people.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.100]  I don't like socialism unless Qaddafi's running it.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:29.081]  I mean, when Qaddafi ran it, he actually really did take the oil, the money, and actually create a country.
[01:25:29.662 --> 01:25:30.742]  That's why they took him out, folks.
[01:25:30.802 --> 01:25:32.462]  I'm not lionizing Muammar Qaddafi.
[01:25:32.802 --> 01:25:33.682]  He did some bad stuff.
[01:25:33.702 --> 01:25:35.623]  The point is, compared to our leaders,
[01:25:36.423 --> 01:25:37.643]  Well, I've got her on to be the guest.
[01:25:37.743 --> 01:25:38.544]  I'm just ranting.
[01:25:38.584 --> 01:25:39.404]  It makes me so mad.
[01:25:39.424 --> 01:25:46.907]  We're going to talk about Beyonce and the rest of it, but you were getting into Hillary and just the things she's done and the women of the hegemon.
[01:25:47.487 --> 01:25:53.549]  Look, I say get more women in government, but at the same time, some of the biggest warmongers we've ever seen have been women.
[01:25:53.809 --> 01:25:56.670]  I don't know where this idea comes in that just because it's a woman, it's going to be great.
[01:25:56.710 --> 01:25:56.930]  Cynthia?
[01:25:58.393 --> 01:26:01.734]  Well, you know, Alex, I used to think that.
[01:26:02.274 --> 01:26:22.019]  I used to think that if you put women in policy-making positions, that people would be taken care of, that the healthcare system would be better, that the education system would be better, and that neighborhoods would be safer and cleaner.
[01:26:22.499 --> 01:26:27.000]  I thought that because that's what women generally do.
[01:26:28.168 --> 01:26:33.005]  If it was your mother or my mother, I mean it was the women we know, but just not these women.
[01:26:36.557 --> 01:26:38.278]  That's exactly right.
[01:26:38.578 --> 01:26:46.902]  And so, Dr. Terpstra mentions particularly women like Madeleine Albright, Condoleezza Rice.
[01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:51.344]  You know, these women of the hegemon don't know a particular political party.
[01:26:51.644 --> 01:26:54.045]  They span the political spectrum.
[01:26:54.486 --> 01:26:58.988]  And yet, their policies are worse than the policies of any man.
[01:26:59.648 --> 01:27:03.190]  So, Hillary Clinton fits in that number.
[01:27:03.650 --> 01:27:04.611]  She is a part of that.
[01:27:04.751 --> 01:27:23.442]  Plus, of all of the other criminality, you know, the war crimes, torture, crimes against humanity, crimes against peace, well, we also have three, at least, three outstanding investigations of the way Secretary Clinton ran
[01:27:24.286 --> 01:27:24.907]  That's right.
[01:27:40.563 --> 01:27:47.111]  Because I think they have demonstrated time and time again just exactly what their values are.
[01:27:47.491 --> 01:27:54.059]  And their values have nothing to do with the values, I believe, of the people who are hurting right now.
[01:27:54.079 --> 01:27:54.480]  You're right.
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:59.666]  She's like the leader of Spectre or she's like a master villain like Lex Luthor.
[01:28:00.667 --> 01:28:08.870]  I try to think about all the crimes of Hillary Clinton, and as bad as Bill is, now that I've studied over the years, she really is kind of the boss, quarterbacking the whole deal.
[01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:12.692]  Bill's off raping people and doing drugs, that's bad too, but she wants the power.
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:16.401]  You're absolutely right.
[01:28:16.461 --> 01:28:20.545]  She wants the power, and she has had the opportunity to wield power.
[01:28:20.946 --> 01:28:25.330]  And we have seen the results of her wielding of power.
[01:28:25.851 --> 01:28:33.539]  And so, on the one hand, let me also say something to you, Alex, that probably, you know, I shouldn't broach this subject.
[01:28:34.019 --> 01:28:44.662]  But I'm extremely disappointed with black voters who are bailing out the Hillary Clinton campaign when she doesn't deserve black votes.
[01:28:45.523 --> 01:28:55.686]  I just don't understand the affinity for someone who has been so detrimental to the community at large.
[01:28:56.486 --> 01:29:06.211]  And to the, you know, I didn't think Bill Clinton's Africa policy, his foreign policy could get, could be worse than that.
[01:29:06.252 --> 01:29:08.693]  Cruz missing out on the baby formula factors.
[01:29:08.713 --> 01:29:10.234]  Let me ask this, one minute we have, we're going to break.
[01:29:11.694 --> 01:29:15.557]  Looking at what's happening, why wouldn't Obama do something for the black community?
[01:29:15.577 --> 01:29:18.878]  He almost did less than anybody else and unemployment doubled.
[01:29:18.998 --> 01:29:21.500]  It seemed to me he had it out for the black community.
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:28.464]  Well he definitely, well you know, I ran against Obama.
[01:29:29.965 --> 01:29:43.697]  And I was running because I understood that my values were not going to be reflected by policy coming from the Democratic Party as it is constituted today.
[01:29:44.738 --> 01:29:47.260]  And so I think
[01:29:48.201 --> 01:29:54.945]  President Obama's administration, his tenure, has demonstrated exactly that.
[01:29:54.965 --> 01:29:56.165]  Dr. McKinney, stay there.
[01:29:56.245 --> 01:29:57.906]  From Bangladesh, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:57.946 --> 01:29:59.267]  Robert David Steele's coming up as well.
[01:29:59.447 --> 01:30:00.408]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.848 --> 01:30:02.449]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.369 --> 01:30:06.071]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.138 --> 01:30:16.661]  As a socialist, the word socialism does not frighten me, and I think it's probably fair to say that the Nicaraguan government is primarily a socialist government.
[01:30:16.861 --> 01:30:21.763]  That was Bernie Sanders praising the Nicaraguan communist Sandinistas 30 years ago.
[01:30:22.043 --> 01:30:31.006]  As we see today with the rationing of food, water, medicine, and electricity in Venezuela, the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people's money.
[01:30:31.207 --> 01:30:39.530]  Now Bernie Sandinista, the proud socialist, is running out of other people's money, and he's having to lay off hundreds of staff from his campaign.
[01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:40.170]  Wait!
[01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:42.912]  Can't he just create jobs out of thin air?
[01:30:43.132 --> 01:30:44.834]  Have them dig ditches or something?
[01:30:45.014 --> 01:30:48.616]  Bernie's campaign is the closest he's ever come to managing a business.
[01:30:48.916 --> 01:30:50.377]  And his business is failing.
[01:30:50.618 --> 01:30:59.224]  Even paying his interns only $12 an hour, not quite up to the socialist mandate of $15 an hour, he still can't make ends meet.
[01:30:59.764 --> 01:31:03.086]  I will be attacked by every editorial writer in the free press for being a dumb dupe.
[01:31:03.347 --> 01:31:03.887]  Maybe I am.
[01:31:04.347 --> 01:31:06.769]  You know, socialism has duped a lot of people.
[01:31:07.209 --> 01:31:09.051]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:31:09.983 --> 01:31:16.870]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote, Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[01:31:16.970 --> 01:31:22.135]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties, or in his possessions.
[01:31:22.455 --> 01:31:25.678]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[01:31:25.798 --> 01:31:27.820]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:33.425]  And how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual?
[01:31:33.505 --> 01:31:35.087]  That is the ultimate concern.
[01:31:35.327 --> 01:31:41.471]  The concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[01:31:41.491 --> 01:31:43.932]  It was why the Anti-Federalists opposed the Constitution.
[01:31:43.992 --> 01:31:52.598]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power, but as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[01:31:53.018 --> 01:31:58.023]  People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[01:31:58.424 --> 01:32:03.489]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[01:32:03.789 --> 01:32:07.273]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[01:32:07.493 --> 01:32:09.355]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:32:09.935 --> 01:32:11.818]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[01:32:11.898 --> 01:32:15.883]  Pro-ISIS hackers post kill lists of State Department employees.
[01:32:16.083 --> 01:32:24.454]  Hackers with a pro-ISIS group calling themselves United Cyber Caliphate distributed a kill list that appears to include dozens of US government personnel.
[01:32:24.594 --> 01:32:27.978]  The list features 43 names of people linked to the State Department.
[01:32:28.058 --> 01:32:28.378]  I don't know.
[01:32:52.841 --> 01:32:53.081]  I'm good.
[01:33:12.831 --> 01:33:21.584]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:33:22.365 --> 01:33:23.386]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:33:23.907 --> 01:33:27.612]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:37.859 --> 01:33:48.343]  All right, for the next hour we're going to be joined by Dr. Cynthia McKinney and a gentleman who can really add a lot of information to what we're breaking down, Robert David Steele.
[01:33:48.783 --> 01:33:56.065]  His website is robertdavidsteele.com and Dr. McKinney's site is something everybody should visit as well.
[01:33:56.145 --> 01:33:59.186]  We will also give you that address.
[01:33:59.246 --> 01:34:03.848]  It's allthingscynthiamckinney.com and I'm going to go to them in just a moment.
[01:34:04.448 --> 01:34:07.169]  The point to understand here is transcending left and right.
[01:34:07.569 --> 01:34:09.869]  Both the left and right have real issues and real beefs.
[01:34:10.609 --> 01:34:21.152]  But it's all being weaponized and dumbed down to create societal divide and conquer so that multinationals can literally make us poor as a tool of economic warfare.
[01:34:21.312 --> 01:34:22.932]  And that's their admitted globalist plan.
[01:34:23.732 --> 01:34:26.013]  And they sell it as if it's for the earth and the environment.
[01:34:26.273 --> 01:34:29.634]  It's actually ending innovation and bringing in feudalism again.
[01:34:29.714 --> 01:34:30.854]  That's what they admit they're setting up.
[01:34:31.738 --> 01:34:36.801]  And Cynthia McKinney, Dr. McKinney, and of course Robert David Steele and others are fighting back against that.
[01:34:36.821 --> 01:34:43.005]  And I'm trying to get people to really get organized as they are around understanding what the real game plan is.
[01:34:43.665 --> 01:34:44.826]  Now before we go any further...
[01:34:45.859 --> 01:34:49.523]  Our reporters, you see their footage all over CNN, all over Fox, no credit.
[01:34:50.004 --> 01:34:51.005]  That's fine, I don't care.
[01:34:51.545 --> 01:35:01.376]  People can see that it's folks with Mexican flags running around through liberation theology taught in the colleges by the Rockefeller and Ford Foundation and by the CIA on record.
[01:35:02.267 --> 01:35:04.088]  To teach liberation theology.
[01:35:04.168 --> 01:35:05.908]  And sure, there's a lot of wrongs that have gone on.
[01:35:06.348 --> 01:35:10.150]  But they teach it to create the future breakup of the country.
[01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:15.031]  They'll have a larger multinational sphere than sub-breakups within the countries.
[01:35:15.311 --> 01:35:19.352]  Just like they played off Catholic against Protestant in Ukraine.
[01:35:19.452 --> 01:35:20.633]  Both sides had beefs.
[01:35:21.333 --> 01:35:23.194]  Or Catholic against Orthodox.
[01:35:23.694 --> 01:35:24.694]  Both sides had beefs.
[01:35:24.774 --> 01:35:26.295]  Both sides have been killing each other for 500 years.
[01:35:27.688 --> 01:35:33.251]  The point was they came in with anthropology and sociology and psychology to get everybody at each other's throats.
[01:35:33.751 --> 01:35:34.671]  That's what they're doing.
[01:35:34.691 --> 01:35:37.773]  It's like if aliens invaded, they'd try to get us to fight with each other.
[01:35:38.093 --> 01:35:38.813]  It's the same thing.
[01:35:38.853 --> 01:35:40.214]  It's the great game the British talked about.
[01:35:40.834 --> 01:35:46.257]  Our reporters are going to be up in San Francisco tonight to cover the other Trump rally.
[01:35:46.637 --> 01:35:49.138]  So watch that tonight on the Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central.
[01:35:49.438 --> 01:35:55.361]  My point is, we are true independent media that wears our bias to tell the truth on our sleeve.
[01:35:56.141 --> 01:36:04.389]  And we need your financial support to send reporters to Bilderberg in Germany, to send myself and others to Cleveland and to Philadelphia to cover the DNC.
[01:36:04.969 --> 01:36:20.804]  When you buy a Hillary for Prison t-shirt, or when you buy a Make America Free Again hat, or when you buy the great nutraceuticals we have, you are financing an organization that has the best bang for its buck out there to really change the narrative and put out pro-liberty talking points.
[01:36:21.605 --> 01:36:23.787]  Anthroplex is made for men.
[01:36:23.847 --> 01:36:25.088]  It works great on women as well.
[01:36:25.128 --> 01:36:30.513]  A bunch of known, healthy, clean herbs that boost your vitality, your strength, your energy.
[01:36:30.573 --> 01:36:32.555]  Go read the research for yourself.
[01:36:32.655 --> 01:36:34.757]  It really is an amazing product at a low price.
[01:36:35.918 --> 01:36:38.060]  It's back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[01:36:40.481 --> 01:36:44.362]  Also, super male vitality is a similar formula, a little bit stronger.
[01:36:44.542 --> 01:36:46.303]  It's cold-pressed, that's why it costs a little more.
[01:36:46.683 --> 01:36:47.943]  It's going to sell out by tomorrow.
[01:36:48.423 --> 01:36:50.564]  Never fear, we got plenty of super female vitality.
[01:36:51.144 --> 01:36:54.325]  It's almost the same formula, but people want a male and female formula.
[01:36:54.365 --> 01:36:57.446]  I think it works on me, just because it's got a type of root.
[01:36:57.806 --> 01:36:58.886]  It's got an obnoxious name.
[01:36:59.366 --> 01:37:03.790]  Forget the scientific one, but it has horny goat weeds, one of the ingredients that's in the female that isn't in the male.
[01:37:04.151 --> 01:37:07.754]  But believe me, you get a bottle of this, you'll find out how powerful Mother Nature is.
[01:37:08.194 --> 01:37:09.576]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:37:10.056 --> 01:37:12.659]  The mega sale on storable food will have to end this weekend.
[01:37:13.159 --> 01:37:15.962]  30 to 40% off Infowars Select storable foods.
[01:37:15.982 --> 01:37:16.863]  That doesn't mean select!
[01:37:18.083 --> 01:37:23.247]  It's called InfoWars Select because it's so high quality, very low price, powered by MyPatriot Supply.
[01:37:23.267 --> 01:37:30.031]  We can give you the lowest price anywhere because I have a deal where we are, beyond the distributor, we private label.
[01:37:30.392 --> 01:37:32.893]  So that's how we get around that and lower the price down so low.
[01:37:33.254 --> 01:37:34.594]  That special is going to end.
[01:37:34.915 --> 01:37:38.097]  Of all the things happening in the world, I think you're crazy if you don't get prepared.
[01:37:38.357 --> 01:37:46.743]  And finally, we have a deal with 10% off anybody that signs up for AutoShip, whether it be our non-GMO, high mountain Chiapas grown organic coffee.
[01:37:47.603 --> 01:37:50.824]  Or whether it be the nutraceuticals, or whatever the case may be.
[01:37:51.744 --> 01:37:53.724]  We've got cloils, silver toothbrushes, whatever.
[01:37:53.785 --> 01:37:55.925]  Everything I use, everything I love, we sell it.
[01:37:56.245 --> 01:37:56.925]  It's a win-win.
[01:37:57.305 --> 01:38:00.726]  Whatever works for you on AutoShip, 10% off when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:38:00.986 --> 01:38:04.207]  You can choose how often or when and, you know, cancel any time.
[01:38:04.467 --> 01:38:09.188]  And we also, in closing, have free shipping on orders above $50 or more.
[01:38:09.468 --> 01:38:10.628]  So thank you for your support.
[01:38:10.788 --> 01:38:11.449]  And I want to be clear.
[01:38:13.389 --> 01:38:14.969]  I am a restorationist.
[01:38:15.049 --> 01:38:16.530]  I want to restore the Renaissance.
[01:38:17.423 --> 01:38:20.745]  Restore the enlightenment that was never truly, you know, obviously gained.
[01:38:22.246 --> 01:38:23.487]  But you can call it a revolution.
[01:38:23.567 --> 01:38:31.151]  And most revolutionaries kidnap people or rob banks or, you know, rob shipments of gold bars to fund themselves.
[01:38:31.851 --> 01:38:32.532]  We don't do that.
[01:38:32.592 --> 01:38:34.013]  We sell high-quality products.
[01:38:34.753 --> 01:38:40.977]  But understand, there was a revolution in organic food going back a decade ago, 15 years ago, where there wasn't organic food anywhere to be gotten.
[01:38:41.337 --> 01:38:47.720]  People started buying it, the price went down, the variety went up, now you go to Target or Walmart, it says organic this, organic that.
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:50.361]  Still there's some fraud there half the time, but it doesn't matter.
[01:38:50.741 --> 01:38:54.462]  We're winning the culture war, instead of just fighting with each other over what color we are.
[01:38:55.103 --> 01:39:02.145]  That's an example when you support people like Cynthia McKinney or Mr. Steele or others who are independent voices.
[01:39:02.405 --> 01:39:10.649]  Doesn't mean you totally agree with them, but they see the empire, they see the dehumanizing tyranny, they're speaking out against it, and when you support them, when you
[01:39:11.229 --> 01:39:17.510]  You know, go get one of Steele's books, or go and support one of the projects of Cynthia McKinney, or any other guest we have on.
[01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:25.752]  It builds an economy of true diversity of ideas, not the one-party, two-headed monster that we're dealing with.
[01:39:25.812 --> 01:39:28.772]  So that said, I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:39:29.233 --> 01:39:33.333]  Now, Cynthia McKinney, again, is going to be riding shotgun with us five minutes to the next hour.
[01:39:33.613 --> 01:39:35.594]  Mr. Steele will be with us to the bottom of the next hour.
[01:39:36.474 --> 01:39:37.295]  And he joins us now.
[01:39:37.315 --> 01:39:42.022]  We're going to have a triple, triple threat here for folks watching on television with a split screen.
[01:39:42.362 --> 01:39:50.233]  Robert David Steele wants to get into race war, Trump presidency, the destabilization program that he and Dr. McKinney think is going on.
[01:39:50.253 --> 01:39:53.117]  We haven't gotten into Beyonce yet and her music videos.
[01:39:53.838 --> 01:40:16.413]  We'll also talk about how Bernie Sanders and George Soros and the riots are supporting elements in the Hillary Show, how the Secret Service colleagues are planning to release dirt on Hillary after she becomes the nominee, Sanders refusing to introduce the Electoral Reform Act because he's bought and paid for by Hillary, how Trump can win and why his current staff sucks, how we are all black now and how Trump can win big with both great
[01:40:17.992 --> 01:40:24.398]  Disruptor and great uniner on the four angry groups, whites, blacks, Latinos and youth and college degrees and no work.
[01:40:25.059 --> 01:40:28.102]  And so he's got seven paths to victory that I can try to get to Donald Trump.
[01:40:28.142 --> 01:40:30.945]  I mean, he's very hard to get to and pretty much listens to himself.
[01:40:31.746 --> 01:40:33.688]  And so a lot of exciting things to talk about.
[01:40:33.708 --> 01:40:37.091]  Now, going back to Cynthia McKinney to finish her point.
[01:40:37.451 --> 01:40:40.775]  She got cut off by the break and to introduce the topic of why you're both here.
[01:40:42.315 --> 01:40:56.906]  Dr. McKinney, looking at media control, looking at Beyonce, just one example, looking at the NFL and the Pentagon funding, they really got upset when I talked about this last week and had hundreds of publications come out and demonize this broadcast.
[01:40:57.166 --> 01:40:58.187]  What do you think's behind that?
[01:41:01.178 --> 01:41:23.882]  Well, I have to believe that just as we have these color revolutions that are fabricated around the world, that eventually what the United States does to other countries, those who orchestrate those activities don't hesitate to do it inside the United States as well.
[01:41:24.562 --> 01:41:28.743]  And we saw that with COINTELPRO and the
[01:41:29.423 --> 01:41:29.943]  I don't know.
[01:41:59.275 --> 01:42:09.180]  Like, I can't say left and right any longer because, quite frankly, it's almost like there is no left and right anymore.
[01:42:10.401 --> 01:42:26.410]  It's who has the values and the care and concern about the people of the United States and, of course, the rest of the world to care enough to come together despite what's supposed to keep us apart.
[01:42:27.330 --> 01:42:31.153]  And that is what I've been committed to, and that's what I'm trying to do.
[01:42:31.753 --> 01:42:40.519]  Actually, I've been invited to go to the Democrat convention as well as the Republican convention.
[01:42:40.919 --> 01:42:42.220]  Not on the inside.
[01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:59.950]  But on the outside and trying to talk to people and use those skills that I learned while I was in the Congress and having to reach out to all different kinds of people to reach out, Democrat, Republican, let's come together.
[01:43:00.010 --> 01:43:07.815]  Let's work together on one or two projects that will allow us to, in fact, take our country back.
[01:43:08.815 --> 01:43:09.395]  Absolutely.
[01:43:09.515 --> 01:43:14.978]  I want to get Mr. Steele introduced here and talk about Beyonce and then introduce that into larger topics.
[01:43:15.038 --> 01:43:19.320]  But so many people said, really CIA?
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:23.781]  My point is that whole platform is government-run, government-financed.
[01:43:23.801 --> 01:43:26.303]  The CIA is just one noticeable name.
[01:43:26.343 --> 01:43:29.144]  I mean, do I think she's getting marching orders herself?
[01:43:29.264 --> 01:43:29.484]  No.
[01:43:29.524 --> 01:43:31.765]  Her producers are pushing an agenda.
[01:43:32.325 --> 01:43:34.246]  Of rioting and attacking the police.
[01:43:34.566 --> 01:43:37.968]  And you don't reform the police, you know, shooting them or burning them or going after them.
[01:43:38.248 --> 01:43:40.930]  You do it taking your government back and then reforming it that way.
[01:43:40.990 --> 01:43:48.894]  So the very globalists that have militarized our police now want the detonator to be the election, the inner city communities, the rest of it.
[01:43:49.194 --> 01:43:50.915]  And you can really see it being set up.
[01:43:51.275 --> 01:43:59.900]  I want to get Mr. Steele's take on this and his expert analysis, formerly with the Central Intelligence Agency, actually in the field, folks, not just sitting behind a desk.
[01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:06.645]  On whether he agrees with Dr. McKinney, this is part of an attempt at beta testing a color revolution in this country.
[01:44:07.886 --> 01:44:16.572]  Oh, I absolutely agree with you, Alex, and I love Dr. McKinney, and most people don't realize she did a brilliant PhD thesis on Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.
[01:44:17.393 --> 01:44:27.100]  This is a lady who not only represents the people of color, but she's deeply familiar with Latin America and all the good things that Latinos such as myself represent.
[01:44:28.461 --> 01:44:29.342]  I think Charleston
[01:44:29.762 --> 01:44:37.248]  Was actually a kid on drugs controlled, and they were testing a false flag activity in the United States.
[01:44:38.249 --> 01:44:45.996]  I personally believe that it's no longer CIA, it's contractors paid for by George Sotos, among others.
[01:44:47.036 --> 01:45:03.447]  So the cat is out and people are deathly afraid of the angry people represented by Donald Trump and the angry young people represented by Bernie Sanders coming together with veterans, soccer moms, Latinos, and people of color.
[01:45:04.665 --> 01:45:08.127]  Occupy was undermined by George Sotos and Michael Bloomberg.
[01:45:08.728 --> 01:45:11.469]  I believe we are now a hair away.
[01:45:11.489 --> 01:45:14.731]  And frankly, Donald Trump is his own worst enemy.
[01:45:14.831 --> 01:45:16.993]  I don't think he was planning to get this far.
[01:45:17.373 --> 01:45:19.374]  And so he had a very shallow staff.
[01:45:19.815 --> 01:45:23.577]  He ought to have Russ Bernay, Perot's campaign manager, working for him.
[01:45:23.837 --> 01:45:26.959]  You ought to have Cynthia McKinney at his side every single day.
[01:45:27.619 --> 01:45:35.363]  And of course, I have seven specific things I wrote about in Counterpunch in August of 2015, but there's nobody on Trump's staff that answers the phone.
[01:45:35.524 --> 01:45:36.404]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:45:36.464 --> 01:45:42.728]  You were here about six, seven, eight months ago about Trump, and you said he should reach out to the Sanders people then.
[01:45:43.088 --> 01:45:46.670]  He is now doing that, so this stuff does trickle through to Trump.
[01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:51.596]  I've personally said a few things to him, and then a week later, you know, he's saying, hey, let's audit the private Federal Reserve.
[01:45:51.976 --> 01:45:56.562]  I think he's for real, I think he means well, but he is, he is a bit old-fashioned.
[01:45:56.582 --> 01:45:59.927]  He's not very tech-savvy, and so there are some issues there.
[01:46:01.388 --> 01:46:03.129]  I agree with you, and I'll tell you something.
[01:46:03.149 --> 01:46:05.390]  This is Trump's election to lose.
[01:46:05.470 --> 01:46:17.055]  I've just come back from Norway and Denmark, and people are starting to realize not only all of the huge negatives on Hillary Clinton, warmonger who, her email scandal is not about a few secret emails.
[01:46:17.115 --> 01:46:19.916]  Her email scandal is about a private foreign policy.
[01:46:20.316 --> 01:46:23.479]  Wayne Madsen broke this story and has appeared on your show.
[01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:26.082]  Hillary Clinton was selling U.S.
[01:46:26.142 --> 01:46:29.525]  foreign policy through the Clinton Foundation to the highest bidder.
[01:46:30.046 --> 01:46:36.332]  And that woman should be under indictment for multiple murders as well as crimes against humanity.
[01:46:38.635 --> 01:46:44.980]  That Donald Trump might be an outrageous president is exceeded only by the atrocity of Hillary Clinton.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:51.706]  Well I was about to say, I mean I saw an RT article where the Russian government says, hey, you think Obama's been bad for Russian relations?
[01:46:51.746 --> 01:46:52.667]  Wait till Hillary gets in.
[01:46:54.224 --> 01:46:55.365]  That's absolutely right.
[01:46:55.505 --> 01:46:56.665]  And I agree with Putin.
[01:46:56.705 --> 01:46:59.867]  I mean, he's pointed out that he's only got three bases overseas.
[01:47:00.227 --> 01:47:02.488]  Donald Trump has some very good advisors.
[01:47:02.528 --> 01:47:04.149]  He also has some crazy people.
[01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:14.274]  But he has some very good advisors who are starting to point out that the easiest way to reduce the Pentagon budget and make America strong again is to close all of those overseas bases.
[01:47:14.694 --> 01:47:15.495]  That's step one.
[01:47:15.855 --> 01:47:17.556]  And then have a grand strategy summit.
[01:47:19.105 --> 01:47:23.473]  Absolutely, and then they claim, well the Pentagon says we save money being overseas.
[01:47:23.553 --> 01:47:23.834]  Bull!
[01:47:24.074 --> 01:47:25.156]  We have nuclear weapons.
[01:47:25.517 --> 01:47:27.620]  If Kim Jong-un tries to invade, he'll be destroyed.
[01:47:27.941 --> 01:47:29.924]  I mean, it's all just circus behavior.
[01:47:30.741 --> 01:47:32.143]  It's not just circus behavior.
[01:47:32.183 --> 01:47:36.046]  Dr. McKinney and I have talked about this a lot, and I really respect her leadership.
[01:47:36.386 --> 01:47:45.294]  The bottom line is that General Bob Scales has pointed out that the infantry is 4% of the force, takes 80% of the casualties, and gets 1% of the budget.
[01:47:45.674 --> 01:47:49.417]  Pentagon waste is documented at between 45% in weapons acquisition to 75% in Afghanistan.
[01:47:53.701 --> 01:47:58.486]  We need a 450-ship Navy, a long-haul Air Force, and an air mobile army.
[01:47:58.746 --> 01:48:00.848]  But the first thing... Look at the F-35!
[01:48:00.888 --> 01:48:01.929]  You talk about treason.
[01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:05.672]  It's over a billion dollars and isn't as good as an F-15 from 30 years ago.
[01:48:06.713 --> 01:48:10.477]  Look, the Pentagon is a corrupt cesspool.
[01:48:11.337 --> 01:48:19.225]  And the first thing we have to do is get rid of half of the flag officers, half of the senior executive officers, and two-thirds of the contractors.
[01:48:20.114 --> 01:48:23.698]  Well let me then expand on this because people really want to know and it struck a chord.
[01:48:24.058 --> 01:48:32.267]  The nerve of Esquire and New York Daily News and others to come out and say I'm insane, there's no government involvement in the NFL.
[01:48:32.347 --> 01:48:35.190]  And in the video I said the CIA's been involved, showed articles.
[01:48:35.630 --> 01:48:37.852]  I said the Pentagon's been involved, showed articles.
[01:48:39.013 --> 01:48:44.839]  The ban on domestic propaganda lifted three years ago, including deception against the American people by the CIA.
[01:48:45.159 --> 01:48:47.641]  And then they sat there and told their readers that none of it existed.
[01:48:47.922 --> 01:48:50.584]  Is that why the media has a 6% trust rate?
[01:48:50.924 --> 01:48:54.728]  Don't these people get that they're lying to folks, but it's not working anymore?
[01:48:55.028 --> 01:48:56.890]  And then Dr. McKinney pop in any time.
[01:48:59.673 --> 01:49:01.374]  Well, I want to defer to Dr. McKinney.
[01:49:01.434 --> 01:49:06.597]  I will just say that Alan Dulles and the people after him are on record as saying they own the media.
[01:49:07.458 --> 01:49:09.058]  Now, that's not quite true today.
[01:49:09.118 --> 01:49:12.580]  The media is owned by the same 40 billionaires that own Congress.
[01:49:13.661 --> 01:49:18.024]  But the bottom line is that the CIA sources and methods have proliferated.
[01:49:18.424 --> 01:49:21.786]  It's now legal to do propaganda in the United States.
[01:49:22.326 --> 01:49:25.408]  And Matt Tobey's written a great book on griftopia.
[01:49:25.808 --> 01:49:29.070]  Which is essentially the legalization of crimes against humanity.
[01:49:29.490 --> 01:49:30.751]  The two-party tyranny.
[01:49:30.831 --> 01:49:38.856]  I had to run for president to find out that we have eight parties and that a majority of the Americans no longer consider them part of either of the two-party tyranny.
[01:49:40.257 --> 01:49:41.058]  We're out of control.
[01:49:41.258 --> 01:49:50.284]  And Donald Trump is the one guy, if he's not assassinated, who has a prospect for actually restoring Article 1 of the Constitution.
[01:49:50.304 --> 01:49:50.424]  Sure.
[01:49:50.444 --> 01:49:51.585]  Let me raise that to Dr. McKinney.
[01:49:52.025 --> 01:49:53.286]  That's a really good point, though.
[01:49:53.866 --> 01:50:07.134]  I mean, isn't this the death of the two-party system showing it's a fraud when they just start stealing delegates from Sanders, stealing them from Trump, canceling primaries altogether, and then looking at us with a straight face going, you don't vote.
[01:50:07.394 --> 01:50:08.575]  I mean, they really are arrogant.
[01:50:08.655 --> 01:50:09.876]  Priebus up there smiling.
[01:50:09.896 --> 01:50:10.456]  Dr. McKinney?
[01:50:13.798 --> 01:50:16.060]  Well, I think the...
[01:50:17.182 --> 01:50:23.266]  Fractures that always existed in the U.S.
[01:50:23.326 --> 01:50:33.974]  polity have come to the forefront now so that average ordinary citizens are starting to go, what is a superdelegate and why is my vote not counting?
[01:50:34.314 --> 01:50:35.675]  So you've got
[01:50:36.976 --> 01:50:49.865]  People who now understand that these landmines have been placed inside the system to keep us from having control of the system that we're supposed to control in the first place.
[01:50:49.885 --> 01:50:50.305]  That's right.
[01:50:50.406 --> 01:51:01.714]  So I think it's a darn good thing that Bernie Sanders has taken it to Hillary so effectively that the Democratic
[01:51:02.334 --> 01:51:08.458]  Establishment has tried to, uh, has had to resort to... That's right, stay there doctors.
[01:51:08.618 --> 01:51:09.218]  We'll come right back.
[01:51:09.278 --> 01:51:09.539]  Great point.
[01:51:10.019 --> 01:51:11.420]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:13.001]  You can't survive without it.
[01:51:13.161 --> 01:51:14.081]  But where do you get it?
[01:51:14.361 --> 01:51:20.105]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:51:20.345 --> 01:51:26.087]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:51:26.267 --> 01:51:43.113]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:51:43.513 --> 01:51:45.655]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:51:45.995 --> 01:51:47.196]  Stainless steel construction.
[01:51:47.476 --> 01:51:48.256]  Easy assembly.
[01:51:48.517 --> 01:51:49.137]  Low maintenance.
[01:51:49.417 --> 01:51:51.238]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[01:52:18.743 --> 01:52:26.834]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:52:27.134 --> 01:52:31.816]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:52:31.997 --> 01:52:38.720]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:45.883]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:52:45.984 --> 01:52:52.827]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:52:53.007 --> 01:52:57.353]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:52:57.473 --> 01:53:00.737]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:53:00.877 --> 01:53:07.005]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.

[01:53:09.488 --> 01:53:12.791]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:53:12.951 --> 01:53:15.213]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:53:15.394 --> 01:53:23.761]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:53:24.022 --> 01:53:29.607]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it after consulting top doctors, nutritionists,
[01:53:29.767 --> 01:53:45.440]  Pharmacist and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:47.522]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:53:47.862 --> 01:53:55.546]  Supermail Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:53:55.826 --> 01:54:01.990]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[01:54:22.645 --> 01:54:24.146]  Don't want no shackles!
[01:54:24.646 --> 01:54:25.926]  Don't want no shackles on me!
[01:54:25.966 --> 01:54:26.687]  Don't want no shackles!
[01:54:44.775 --> 01:54:46.015]  Then I'll just be here with steel.
[01:54:46.816 --> 01:54:48.576]  Dr. McKinney, you got cut off by the break.
[01:54:48.616 --> 01:54:51.477]  You were making points about the election, where it's all going.
[01:54:52.357 --> 01:54:53.258]  What is your gut?
[01:54:53.638 --> 01:54:55.698]  You're a smart lady, been in Congress, been around the world.
[01:54:56.599 --> 01:54:58.739]  What does your gut tell you about where this world's going?
[01:54:58.779 --> 01:55:07.822]  Because when the media has a 6% approval rating and Congress has a 9% approval rating, they've got to know they're not operating with the consent of the governed.
[01:55:09.003 --> 01:55:10.123]  Now they start openly
[01:55:11.741 --> 01:55:14.843]  Installing leaders in sham elections.
[01:55:16.084 --> 01:55:19.005]  No one really has a responsibility to follow these laws anymore.
[01:55:19.045 --> 01:55:24.048]  I mean, are we just waking up and realizing we were kind of in an oligarchy all along?
[01:55:24.708 --> 01:55:25.269]  Dr. McKinney?
[01:55:26.650 --> 01:55:31.392]  Well, you know, former President Jimmy Carter said that we were an oligarchy.
[01:55:31.753 --> 01:55:36.455]  How many, at least about two years ago, he made that announcement.
[01:55:36.735 --> 01:55:39.417]  And for some of us who have been observing
[01:55:42.503 --> 01:55:43.404]  We're good to go.
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:13.466]  So just as we had the power to stop it and failed to do so, we still have the power to stop it.
[01:56:13.486 --> 01:56:25.993]  But this time, I believe the noose is so tight around the Republic itself.
[01:56:26.963 --> 01:56:36.450]  That the United States of America, as we have known the United States of America, will cease to exist.
[01:56:37.090 --> 01:56:40.653]  Robert David Steele, I agree with you that we talk about CIA, that's more of a metaphor.
[01:56:41.373 --> 01:56:46.717]  It's CIA technologies, mind control, propaganda technologies, the big foundations and media are using.
[01:56:46.737 --> 01:56:47.998]  The CIA is involved as well.
[01:56:48.238 --> 01:56:51.881]  That's just one of the better known groups, so I use that in the headline to get people's attention.
[01:56:53.300 --> 01:56:55.101]  I don't think their propaganda's working.
[01:56:55.841 --> 01:56:59.082]  I mean, I talk to people that are in the government, even high level, they don't like what's going on.
[01:56:59.822 --> 01:57:04.543]  So, I mean, how many controllers are there who are forcing their agenda on humanity?
[01:57:04.803 --> 01:57:06.964]  It seems like we should just all stop complying.
[01:57:07.684 --> 01:57:11.885]  People inside the government should just stop complying, and this thing would fall very, very quickly.
[01:57:12.910 --> 01:57:16.495]  I believe Donald Trump is being severely underestimated.
[01:57:16.555 --> 01:57:20.681]  I mean, I'm a huge fan of Fox News, mostly because I refuse to watch CNN.
[01:57:21.943 --> 01:57:29.073]  But when they talk about Trump versus Hillary, they have no idea what happens if Donald Trump calls for a general strike.
[01:57:30.185 --> 01:57:33.566]  What happens if Donald Trump names Cynthia McKinney as his vice president?
[01:57:33.806 --> 01:57:36.628]  I think she would be an absolutely phenomenal choice.
[01:57:37.608 --> 01:57:42.850]  What happens if the people of color and the Latinos actually get outreach?
[01:57:42.890 --> 01:57:47.752]  Now, in the half hour when I'm on with you, I'll go with the seven things that I came on the show to state.
[01:57:48.112 --> 01:57:55.775]  But the bottom line here is that imagine a day not just without Mexicans, but a day without white people and black people.
[01:57:56.395 --> 01:57:58.116]  That will rock the nation.
[01:58:00.017 --> 01:58:12.607]  Well, they're definitely trying to divide everybody, and I just, in my gut, see the destabilization happening all over the world, and it makes me wonder, how much crazier can it get?
[01:58:12.627 --> 01:58:17.871]  It can get a whole lot crazier.
[01:58:17.892 --> 01:58:22.395]  It can get a whole lot crazier, and that's my point, that we don't have
[01:58:26.281 --> 01:58:33.104]  much time before the noose is tightened around the neck of the U.S.
[01:58:33.164 --> 01:58:34.064]  body politics.
[01:58:34.484 --> 01:58:42.688]  And if we are to save this body and prevent it from becoming a cadaver, we have got to act and act fast.
[01:58:42.748 --> 01:58:48.350]  And I agree with you, Alex, that not only resistance but failure to comply.
[01:58:48.630 --> 01:58:50.571]  We've got to stop complying.
[01:58:50.731 --> 01:58:52.232]  Stay there, we're back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:52.372 --> 01:58:53.934]  We're already into the third hour, folks.
[01:58:53.974 --> 01:58:58.998]  Final segment with Cynthia McKinney, then I'm going to be with Robert David Steele, formerly in the CIA, to break down how we take the country back.
[01:59:00.957 --> 01:59:07.480]  As a socialist, the word socialism does not frighten me, and I think it's probably fair to say that the Nicaraguan government is primarily a socialist government.
[01:59:07.681 --> 01:59:12.563]  That was Bernie Sanders praising the Nicaraguan communist Sandinistas 30 years ago.
[01:59:12.843 --> 01:59:21.828]  As we see today with the rationing of food, water, medicine, and electricity in Venezuela, the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people's money.
[01:59:22.028 --> 01:59:30.352]  Now Bernie Sandinista, the proud socialist, is running out of other people's money, and he's having to lay off hundreds of staff from his campaign.
[01:59:30.692 --> 01:59:30.972]  Wait!
[01:59:31.292 --> 01:59:33.714]  Can't he just create jobs out of thin air?
[01:59:33.934 --> 01:59:35.655]  Have them dig ditches or something?
[01:59:35.835 --> 01:59:39.437]  Bernie's campaign is the closest he's ever come to managing a business.
[01:59:39.717 --> 01:59:41.198]  And his business is failing.
[01:59:41.418 --> 01:59:50.043]  Even paying his interns only $12 an hour, not quite up to the socialist mandate of $15 an hour, he still can't make ends meet.
[01:59:50.583 --> 01:59:53.885]  I will be attacked by every editorial writer in the free press for being a dumb duke.
[01:59:54.165 --> 01:59:54.705]  Maybe I am.
[01:59:55.165 --> 01:59:57.587]  You know, socialism has duped a lot of people.
[01:59:58.027 --> 01:59:59.848]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:04.609]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:22.862 --> 02:00:30.366]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:00:31.346 --> 02:00:35.248]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:35.708 --> 02:00:39.530]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:00:39.891 --> 02:00:41.511]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:44.093 --> 02:00:46.654]  Dr. Cynthia McKinney is in Bangladesh, India.
[02:00:48.058 --> 02:00:50.300]  Robert David Steele joins us from the United States.
[02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:52.581]  I'm coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[02:00:53.762 --> 02:00:57.165]  Look, we're living in a very epic time right now.
[02:00:59.527 --> 02:01:02.649]  And all I know is the globalists are anti-human eugenicists.
[02:01:02.669 --> 02:01:04.230]  They're creating a science of control.
[02:01:04.651 --> 02:01:06.472]  In their own words, they're targeting everybody.
[02:01:06.752 --> 02:01:08.634]  And the only way we beat them is coming together.
[02:01:08.654 --> 02:01:12.757]  But that means coming together with ideas that are outside their box and outside their system.
[02:01:13.943 --> 02:01:15.224]  And that's what it comes down to.
[02:01:15.584 --> 02:01:16.285]  I'll start with this.
[02:01:16.425 --> 02:01:23.149]  Big megabanks shouldn't be tax-exempt, and we shouldn't have to pay for the derivatives, and they shouldn't be able to hold us hostage, threatening to implode the world economy.
[02:01:23.189 --> 02:01:25.591]  And Dr. McKinney, we saw this in 2007 and 2008.
[02:01:26.472 --> 02:01:28.193]  They admit it's much bigger and worse now.
[02:01:28.553 --> 02:01:38.340]  They're intending to hold us hostage again, and then probably again in another decade, to bring in total tyranny, and to bring in their corporate world government.
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:41.102]  How do we stop that, or do you agree that that's one of the big threats?
[02:01:43.024 --> 02:01:45.426]  Oh, I absolutely agree that that's a big threat.
[02:01:46.127 --> 02:01:54.774]  And, you know, there are some groups that have organized now that have average, ordinary folks running for Congress.
[02:01:54.854 --> 02:02:09.786]  There's a group that's trying to break the hold of the Democratic Party from the of the black vote and get black voters to think more independently and, of course, more critically.
[02:02:13.510 --> 02:02:24.473]  That's desperately needed, but I can guarantee you that if we fail to come together, that the situation is dire for the United States and for the future of our country.
[02:02:24.973 --> 02:02:33.915]  Therefore, that is why I've been invited to go to the GOP convention and the Democratic Party convention on the outside, not on the inside.
[02:02:34.215 --> 02:02:37.996]  And the invitation came from people on the left who now get it.
[02:02:38.536 --> 02:02:49.702]  That we have got to talk to people on the quote-unquote right, because as I said, the left and the right have come together and need to come together.
[02:02:49.783 --> 02:02:54.765]  And that's why they're trying to cause a faux fight at the grassroots to get everybody at each other's throats.
[02:02:55.246 --> 02:03:04.231]  I mean, do you agree with Steele, and you're talking about this after you're gone, that they are trying to start a sex war, a race war, light just to create more fear?
[02:03:07.671 --> 02:03:08.372]  Absolutely!
[02:03:08.452 --> 02:03:17.401]  I think that's what this rioting campaign event is all about.
[02:03:17.721 --> 02:03:25.188]  And as I say, I don't want to marginalize in any way people who have a legitimate grievance.
[02:03:26.601 --> 02:03:32.290]  But those are not the people who are throwing things and beating and bashing in windows and things like that.
[02:03:32.911 --> 02:03:40.002]  I absolutely see the possibility of a color revolution coming home in the United States.
[02:03:41.215 --> 02:03:42.896]  Undoubtedly, that's what the globalists are trying.
[02:03:42.936 --> 02:03:49.963]  When we come back, I'm going to talk about who the players are, how we stop them with Robert David Steele, formerly with the CIA, case officer on the ground.
[02:03:50.003 --> 02:03:51.224]  So a real former CIA guy.
[02:03:51.324 --> 02:03:58.371]  It's so giant now, all these agencies and analysts and all the rest of it and every blue blood, you know, their son or daughter has a CIA badge now.
[02:03:58.391 --> 02:04:00.593]  They're just everywhere running around like they're the new royalty.
[02:04:00.973 --> 02:04:01.714]  Truly sickening.
[02:04:01.734 --> 02:04:05.816]  So we're going to be breaking all that down with a real former CIA guy, Robert David Steele, straight ahead.
[02:04:05.876 --> 02:04:06.897]  RobertDavidSteele.com.
[02:04:07.217 --> 02:04:09.259]  Cynthia McKinney, all thingsCynthiaMcKinney.com.
[02:04:09.859 --> 02:04:13.202]  Dr. McKinney, if you're ever coming through Texas or whatever, we'd love to have you in the studio.
[02:04:13.562 --> 02:04:16.444]  Thank you for your tireless work defending free humanity.
[02:04:17.925 --> 02:04:18.665]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:19.646 --> 02:04:20.166]  Bye, Robert.
[02:04:20.186 --> 02:04:21.768]  Bye, Cynthia.
[02:04:22.128 --> 02:04:22.528]  Love ya.
[02:04:22.928 --> 02:04:23.349]  Okay.
[02:04:24.289 --> 02:04:24.970]  She's a great lady.
[02:04:24.990 --> 02:04:25.650]  We're going to go to break.
[02:04:26.371 --> 02:04:27.732]  Dave, we're going to break in 30 seconds.
[02:04:28.152 --> 02:04:29.373]  What do you want to hit first when we come back?
[02:04:32.125 --> 02:04:34.608]  Oh, I want to outline seven paths to victory.
[02:04:34.688 --> 02:04:36.550]  Trump wasn't expecting to get this far.
[02:04:37.531 --> 02:04:39.593]  So you really think he wasn't expecting to get this far?
[02:04:39.613 --> 02:04:41.355]  What was the point of running, just to bring these issues up?
[02:04:42.076 --> 02:04:43.397]  He's just like Steve Forbes.
[02:04:43.758 --> 02:04:44.539]  I mean, exactly.
[02:04:44.579 --> 02:04:50.926]  He wanted a little status, and the Republican Party self-destructed, and God bless them because Donald Trump is our last chance.
[02:04:52.208 --> 02:04:54.570]  Seems like all the insiders and experts are saying that.
[02:04:54.690 --> 02:04:56.912]  Explain to us why is the last chance we come back in three minutes.
[02:04:56.952 --> 02:04:58.754]  Robert David Steele is our guest.
[02:04:58.774 --> 02:05:03.398]  Find out about his group of amazing websites just by going to his main site.
[02:05:04.058 --> 02:05:04.518]  We'll be back.
[02:05:04.538 --> 02:05:04.899]  Stay with us.
[02:05:10.487 --> 02:05:13.430]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[02:05:13.730 --> 02:05:23.318]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[02:06:07.928 --> 02:06:11.130]  Brain Force is here.
[02:06:11.670 --> 02:06:13.931]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:06:14.212 --> 02:06:22.017]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:06:22.819 --> 02:06:26.381]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[02:06:26.401 --> 02:06:28.743]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:06:29.123 --> 02:06:32.626]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:06:32.666 --> 02:06:35.828]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:06:36.308 --> 02:06:41.111]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:06:41.652 --> 02:06:43.473]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[02:06:43.833 --> 02:06:48.276]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:06:48.416 --> 02:06:50.418]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:06:51.058 --> 02:06:52.519]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:06:52.659 --> 02:06:52.899]  Exactly.
[02:06:52.919 --> 02:06:56.741]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:06:57.222 --> 02:07:05.226]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:07:09.969 --> 02:07:11.330]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:07:11.610 --> 02:07:12.910]  You can't survive without it.
[02:07:13.090 --> 02:07:14.011]  But where do you get it?
[02:07:14.311 --> 02:07:20.073]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:07:20.293 --> 02:07:26.015]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:07:26.195 --> 02:07:43.062]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:07:43.462 --> 02:07:45.584]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:07:45.944 --> 02:07:47.145]  Stainless steel construction.
[02:07:47.405 --> 02:07:48.126]  Easy assembly.
[02:07:48.466 --> 02:07:49.086]  Low maintenance.
[02:07:49.367 --> 02:07:51.188]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[02:08:27.890 --> 02:08:31.418]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:08:31.999 --> 02:08:33.924]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:36.998 --> 02:08:40.400]  I will be back this Sunday live in studio 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:41.461]  Central Standard Time.
[02:08:41.521 --> 02:08:44.863]  I've been on air 21 years, been syndicated for 19.
[02:08:44.964 --> 02:08:51.488]  I started the Sunday show about nine years ago because a lot of stations thought I was too radical.
[02:08:51.908 --> 02:08:53.849]  They knew that we got listeners and ratings and the rest of it.
[02:08:54.610 --> 02:09:02.055]  But if they would pick up the Sunday show, they would find out that it wasn't as radical as they thought, that the listeners would resonate with it, and then the pattern almost always went this way.
[02:09:02.095 --> 02:09:06.238]  Then I'd be put on taped at night, and then finally live during the day.
[02:09:07.278 --> 02:09:20.587]  Now, as AM and FM declines because of competition with the internet, it's more important than ever that we be on AM and FM affiliates because that's where you can still reach some giant audiences and that we not just be on internet only, where they can come in and try to censor us.
[02:09:20.647 --> 02:09:23.248]  We need to be multi-platform.
[02:09:24.589 --> 02:09:27.471]  And there's so many ways they're trying to censor us and shut us down.
[02:09:27.571 --> 02:09:28.772]  I don't sit here and whine about it.
[02:09:28.792 --> 02:09:29.512]  I try to get around it.
[02:09:29.552 --> 02:09:30.353]  I try to move over it.
[02:09:30.393 --> 02:09:31.854]  I try to adapt, improvise, whatever.
[02:09:32.174 --> 02:09:33.254]  I guess Steel's a former Marine.
[02:09:33.294 --> 02:09:33.735]  He gets that.
[02:09:35.011 --> 02:09:38.994]  But this is a time to realize everything you do is counting now.
[02:09:39.834 --> 02:09:44.177]  It's a quickening, an acceleration, a political singularity we're moving towards.
[02:09:44.197 --> 02:09:50.802]  Whether that's going to happen as a complete singularity or approach something similar to it, time is being compacted.
[02:09:51.362 --> 02:09:52.543]  The elites know this.
[02:09:52.703 --> 02:09:54.504]  Most of them are digging into armored redoubts.
[02:09:54.945 --> 02:10:00.709]  Most billionaires I've talked to are freaked out and scared, but are bullied by a group above them, the super elite.
[02:10:01.579 --> 02:10:03.101]  And Steele talks a lot about that.
[02:10:03.182 --> 02:10:05.004]  Not everybody that's rich is your enemy.
[02:10:05.385 --> 02:10:07.768]  Not everybody that's in a leftist group is your enemy.
[02:10:08.109 --> 02:10:09.691]  Not every cop is your enemy.
[02:10:09.771 --> 02:10:13.637]  Most people just want to live in a free country, in a free world and care about their kids.
[02:10:14.667 --> 02:10:23.633]  The problem is there's some really bad actors that, to run the world, have to sabotage normal human activity and really create dysfunction to rule chaos.
[02:10:24.414 --> 02:10:28.957]  So do we want a chaos-based world economy or a true collaborative economy based on renaissance?
[02:10:28.977 --> 02:10:29.497]  That's my view.
[02:10:29.517 --> 02:10:34.641]  We'll get Steele's overall view on where we are, how we change things, how powerful ideas are.
[02:10:34.681 --> 02:10:35.101]  But listen.
[02:10:36.402 --> 02:10:38.223]  Realize your ideas have power.
[02:10:38.283 --> 02:10:42.166]  Your choices in the marketplace and politically and everything have huge effects.
[02:10:44.246 --> 02:10:47.369]  And the system wants to try to disenfranchise you because you do have power.
[02:10:47.649 --> 02:10:50.371]  Because they are stealing elections, it's why we should be voting.
[02:10:51.032 --> 02:10:53.554]  To get in, to be involved, to expose what's happening.
[02:10:54.675 --> 02:10:58.338]  They told Trump, and we're going to our guest, shut up and stop complaining, it's always been this way.
[02:10:58.358 --> 02:11:02.181]  No, they haven't always tried to use their crooked rules unless there's an emergency.
[02:11:02.582 --> 02:11:09.728]  So Trump running forced them to try to steal the election, forced them to try this scam, and now it's out in the open blowing up in their face.
[02:11:10.448 --> 02:11:11.650]  Resistance is victory.
[02:11:12.290 --> 02:11:15.212]  Because there's corruption, we don't just roll over in the ditch and give up.
[02:11:15.752 --> 02:11:18.634]  Exposing it is what will bring it down in my historical view.
[02:11:19.115 --> 02:11:29.241]  That's why it's more important than ever to spread the word about InfoWars.com, the articles, the videos, to sign up for our free newsletter and email so we can stay in contact with you as censorship intensifies.
[02:11:29.601 --> 02:11:31.403]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:11:32.003 --> 02:11:37.587]  It's why you should value all the different diverse ideas that are out there and promote them on Facebook and Twitter.
[02:11:37.927 --> 02:11:40.909]  As they try to censor more, that shows we have power.
[02:11:40.969 --> 02:11:44.791]  You've got to intensify what you're doing, not go, oh, they're censoring me.
[02:11:44.831 --> 02:11:45.591]  I'm going to shut up.
[02:11:45.712 --> 02:11:48.513]  No, fight that much harder because we're hurting them.
[02:11:48.954 --> 02:11:50.014]  Now, Steele, I'm ranting.
[02:11:50.254 --> 02:11:53.376]  I want to just set the table there for taking action against tyranny.
[02:11:54.557 --> 02:11:55.318]  How do we do that?
[02:11:56.398 --> 02:12:01.725]  What is your worldview of the competing ideas and what are the seven key points you keep making to Trump?
[02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:10.714]  Well, I keep trying to get them to Trump, but very candidly, I don't think his campaign staff reads their emails or answers the phone.
[02:12:11.654 --> 02:12:15.977]  He has a very shallow staff, and he deeply, desperately needs to fix that.
[02:12:17.617 --> 02:12:29.123]  Our first priority should be to keep Trump from being assassinated, and he does that by weaving a truth and reconciliation theme and a total quick claim for all of the evil that's been done in the past.
[02:12:29.523 --> 02:12:30.584]  Just get out of our way.
[02:12:30.604 --> 02:12:32.525]  Let us restore integrity to our electoral.
[02:12:33.985 --> 02:12:42.649]  I've published two white papers on Amazon, Democracy Riots, We're All Black Now, Deal With It, and Revolution, How Trump Can Win, and they're 99 cent white papers.
[02:12:42.989 --> 02:12:44.830]  They're also free online at my website.
[02:12:45.290 --> 02:12:48.651]  Now, seven specific things that Trump can do in less than one minute.
[02:12:49.251 --> 02:12:55.954]  One, get Governor Abbott and Mike Levin, the radio show host, to run a virtual constitutional convention in Texas.
[02:12:56.474 --> 02:13:03.486]  To run an unemployment workshop in New York City that shames the banks and corporations and makes it clear the real unemployment rate is 23%.
[02:13:03.766 --> 02:13:04.688]  You're right.
[02:13:04.728 --> 02:13:08.714]  He should lay out how globalism screws people, not just say China's screwing us.
[02:13:09.468 --> 02:13:28.546]  Well, let me point out that under the Clintons, as well as Dick Cheney and now Barack Obama, we have not only put more black people in jail because of Bill Clinton's legislation and the Prison Act, but we have also exported more jobs because of NAFTA and other things that Clinton put in place for Rubin and Wall Street.
[02:13:28.826 --> 02:13:33.488]  Hillary Clinton called black people basically feral animals that need to be made to heal.
[02:13:33.908 --> 02:13:43.992]  I don't get why, if you're known racist and your mentor was a grand dragon, why you get to say black people are animals or whatever.
[02:13:44.032 --> 02:13:45.253]  I don't know why she gets to say that.
[02:13:45.833 --> 02:13:48.694]  I'm quite sure she thinks they don't read or watch TV either.
[02:13:49.234 --> 02:13:53.376]  Look, that woman is evil and my Secret Service buddies have so much dirt on her.
[02:13:53.396 --> 02:13:55.577]  Let's get into that before we get into your seven point plan.
[02:13:55.597 --> 02:13:56.137]  That's important.
[02:13:57.389 --> 02:13:57.869]  Say that again?
[02:13:58.049 --> 02:13:59.330]  Talk about your Secret Service news.
[02:13:59.350 --> 02:14:00.930]  I mean, I know that's in your talking points.
[02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:10.553]  Well, look, Hillary Clinton has had a number of overnight guests and my Secret Service pals who are very angry at her because she treats people that serve her like dirt.
[02:14:12.634 --> 02:14:16.175]  I've never heard my buddies talk worse about anyone.
[02:14:16.235 --> 02:14:18.796]  She is evil and rude and mean.
[02:14:19.457 --> 02:14:21.499]  Uh, and selfish, and I think she's a thief.
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:31.091]  Uh, so bottom line is, I don't think people really understand just how easy it is gonna be for Donald Trump to smash Hillary Clinton when he gets to his head.
[02:14:31.111 --> 02:14:31.852]  Let's elaborate on that.
[02:14:31.872 --> 02:14:35.097]  I mean, you're saying, your sources are saying this is gonna be leaked once she's the nominee?
[02:14:36.038 --> 02:14:36.699]  I think so, yes.
[02:14:37.964 --> 02:14:39.085]  Well, that's bombshell.
[02:14:39.145 --> 02:14:39.726]  Here's the problem.
[02:14:39.806 --> 02:14:50.055]  Levin has been basically totally pulled over to be totally anti-Trump, but I hear that would be a good idea if... I mean, I wish they would listen to you, but nobody's bold to actually...
[02:14:51.089 --> 02:14:52.130]  That's exactly right.
[02:14:52.170 --> 02:14:54.832]  I mean, Trump is his own best advisor.
[02:14:54.912 --> 02:15:01.258]  Unfortunately, the people around Trump lack imagination, and they lack the ability to think outside the box.
[02:15:01.678 --> 02:15:12.227]  So the seven points that I published in Counterpunch in an article on 14 August 2015, it was called Countercoop, How Donald Trump Can Win, I've updated these points.
[02:15:12.267 --> 02:15:13.348]  Now, here's the bottom line.
[02:15:13.388 --> 02:15:14.690]  Bernie Sanders is a fraud.
[02:15:15.543 --> 02:15:17.624]  Bernie has cut a deal with the devil.
[02:15:18.005 --> 02:15:20.886]  He's already conceded to Hillary Clinton.
[02:15:20.926 --> 02:15:25.069]  He's already making plans to turn over his mailing list to Hillary Clinton.
[02:15:25.129 --> 02:15:26.210]  He's bought and paid for.
[02:15:26.610 --> 02:15:41.119]  But Donald Trump has the power to work with the Tea Party representatives in the House and to make the deal with Bernie Sanders and work with Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich to have an electoral reform summit and introduce the Electoral Reform Act.
[02:15:42.019 --> 02:15:46.061]  And again, you said this almost a year ago in August, nine months ago.
[02:15:46.101 --> 02:15:47.321]  It's all coming true now.
[02:15:47.781 --> 02:15:50.182]  You said he could win even back then when people thought it was a joke.
[02:15:50.202 --> 02:15:50.862]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:15:51.002 --> 02:15:51.603]  Absolutely.
[02:15:51.683 --> 02:15:54.564]  And I've told him, and others have, you need to go reach out to Ron Paul.
[02:15:54.904 --> 02:15:59.205]  You need to get him to come out and just endorse monetary reform out of the Fed.
[02:15:59.245 --> 02:16:03.767]  Not even your candidacy, but to endorse electoral reform showing the election fraud.
[02:16:04.534 --> 02:16:08.237]  Part of the problem is that Trump has not figured out how to unify everybody.
[02:16:08.277 --> 02:16:16.763]  For example, Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich are two of my favorite people, along with Dr. McKinney, and they have a very special nonpartisan relationship.
[02:16:17.163 --> 02:16:32.614]  If he were to get them and Jesse Ventura and Jill Stein and a few others into an electoral reform summit, he would not only expose the two-party tyranny, and he would also, frankly, shame Bernie Sanders, because point 12 in the Electoral Reform Act is an end to all superdelegates.
[02:16:32.674 --> 02:16:40.185]  Sure, and wouldn't that show that he's a true bonafide populist, and that he wants a coalition to bring in all these people and have a big meeting with them on TV?
[02:16:40.285 --> 02:16:44.431]  Trump has integrity right now, he lacks imagination among his staff.
[02:16:46.013 --> 02:16:49.418]  If he were to force through the Electoral Reform Act,
[02:16:49.858 --> 02:16:58.946]  That would allow 20 to 30 seats being vacated on the Hill to be occupied by Constitution, Libertarian, Green, Independent, even Working Families.
[02:16:59.306 --> 02:17:08.554]  The trade-off for the Republicans is they have to open the tent to the Constitution and Libertarians, who really feel like the Grand Ole Party has been betrayed.
[02:17:08.594 --> 02:17:09.956]  I mean, I'm a Reagan Republican.
[02:17:10.837 --> 02:17:11.197]  Exactly.
[02:17:11.938 --> 02:17:16.904]  The Republican leadership says we'd rather have Hillary than let the Libertarians come in and even have a seat.
[02:17:17.185 --> 02:17:20.929]  But doesn't this just herald the end of the one-party, two-head monopoly?
[02:17:20.969 --> 02:17:24.253]  I can sense and smell they're on their last legs.
[02:17:24.634 --> 02:17:27.297]  It does, but let's not waste this election.
[02:17:28.118 --> 02:17:29.459]  Let's not waste this election.
[02:17:29.519 --> 02:17:34.982]  What we have to do is we have to reach Trump, get him to expand his staff.
[02:17:35.002 --> 02:17:38.084]  For instance, Russ Verne is Ross Perot's campaign manager.
[02:17:38.484 --> 02:17:42.566]  Trump should have Russ working on the independence right now as we speak.
[02:17:42.946 --> 02:17:54.253]  Trump should already be managing, and here are my other three points, a Latino truth and reconciliation event in Florida, a national conversation about a fantasy cabinet, the way we do fantasy football,
[02:17:54.833 --> 02:17:56.315]  Get the public engaged.
[02:17:56.736 --> 02:17:58.118]  A national conversation.
[02:17:58.378 --> 02:18:07.931]  Make it all about the type of government he's got, because he has given some details, but yeah, make it all about a big display, you know, a concept deal about the great city we're going to build.
[02:18:08.935 --> 02:18:15.297]  Yes, and Ben and Jerry should be recruited by Trump to run a national conversation on creating a balanced budget.
[02:18:15.377 --> 02:18:18.518]  And last but not least, we should eliminate all taxes.
[02:18:18.878 --> 02:18:29.441]  We should have an automated payment transaction tax, which is a tiny little tax on every transaction, especially transactions that are not taxed now, such as currency and stock transactions.
[02:18:29.541 --> 02:18:30.181]  Tax the bankers.
[02:18:30.241 --> 02:18:33.022]  If Edgar Feige is still alive, he should be an advisor to Trump.
[02:18:34.448 --> 02:18:38.433]  Well instead we have the megabanks financing a fake social revolution and more taxes.
[02:18:39.133 --> 02:18:45.000]  We got to explain to the people, the working folks, Kennedy cut taxes by 50% and tax receipts doubled in one year.
[02:18:45.461 --> 02:18:46.442]  They just don't get it.
[02:18:46.682 --> 02:18:50.246]  They just don't understand that the megabanks already ran off with the golden goose.
[02:18:50.587 --> 02:18:53.170]  They want to kill the latter into prosperity.
[02:18:54.299 --> 02:18:55.360]  Look, we're going crazy.
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:56.801]  We're going insane as a nation.
[02:18:56.881 --> 02:18:58.763]  I'm looking at the suicide rates going up.
[02:18:58.983 --> 02:19:00.984]  I'm looking at the actual unemployment rate.
[02:19:01.285 --> 02:19:02.465]  Oh, that's my next question!
[02:19:02.546 --> 02:19:04.247]  Why do people seem like they're going so crazy?
[02:19:05.668 --> 02:19:07.449]  I think it's called cognitive dissonance.
[02:19:07.529 --> 02:19:18.217]  I wrote my first graduate thesis on predicting revolution and the most popular graphic at Phi Beta Iota dot net is the graphic that shows all of the preconditions of revolution that exist in the United States today.
[02:19:18.538 --> 02:19:22.641]  The two biggest ones are concentration of wealth and the loss of legitimacy of the government.
[02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:30.126]  And every historical graph that you've got on your site, but other ones as well, show we are just ripe for war, disaster.
[02:19:30.146 --> 02:19:32.908]  I'm not trying to be a fear monger, but I mean, are we not entering that area?
[02:19:32.948 --> 02:19:33.909]  You're absolutely right.
[02:19:34.329 --> 02:19:49.703]  And frankly, Donald Trump, if he were to expand his perception, if he were to expand and take these seven ideas for action, he's probably our last chance for a non-violent revolution that restores integrity to how we govern the United States of America.
[02:19:50.083 --> 02:19:53.444]  FiveBetaIota.net is one of his websites.
[02:19:53.484 --> 02:19:55.105]  RobertDavidSteel.com is easier to remember.
[02:19:55.145 --> 02:19:57.086]  You can get to FiveBetaIota.net.
[02:19:57.106 --> 02:19:59.487]  From there, I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[02:20:00.207 --> 02:20:04.529]  Wow, we've got to have Mr. Steele back up in the near future, and I promise we will.
[02:20:04.849 --> 02:20:05.830]  Thank you, Mr. Steele.
[02:20:05.890 --> 02:20:06.330]  Amazing.
[02:20:06.390 --> 02:20:08.451]  Rob Dew from California, straight ahead then.
[02:20:09.915 --> 02:20:13.238]  There is an attack on the human institution of family.
[02:20:13.978 --> 02:20:17.601]  And if you want to take down the nuclear family, you attack males.
[02:20:18.462 --> 02:20:22.265]  Males are the defender of the human tribe.
[02:20:22.845 --> 02:20:27.569]  When men fall, the rest of humanity can be completely enslaved.
[02:20:28.349 --> 02:20:32.030]  The attack on the family is in movies, sitcoms, dramas.
[02:20:32.310 --> 02:20:33.830]  This isn't to empower women.
[02:20:34.310 --> 02:20:35.831]  This is to wreck civilization.
[02:20:36.071 --> 02:20:41.772]  For too long, we have been allowing the globalist controllers to launch a full-scale chemical war on our masculinity.
[02:20:41.972 --> 02:20:43.052]  You've seen the headlines.
[02:20:43.092 --> 02:20:48.693]  The estrogen mimickers and the gender-bending compounds and the food and water supply are changing the way our bodies work.
[02:20:48.833 --> 02:20:51.394]  And men are the number one target of this
[02:20:51.954 --> 02:20:52.494]  It's on record!
[02:21:22.114 --> 02:21:28.681]  But for myself personally, what I've experienced with the products at Infowarslife.com has been simply amazing.
[02:21:29.562 --> 02:21:32.845]  Supermail Vitality has changed my life in the last three years.
[02:21:33.165 --> 02:21:39.351]  That's why we wanted to develop something that works in conjunction with Supermail to take it to the next level.
[02:21:39.832 --> 02:21:41.313]  It's only been out for about six months.
[02:21:42.154 --> 02:21:50.958]  It sold out so quickly in its first run, and now it is back after months of not being available, Anthroplex.
[02:21:51.739 --> 02:21:57.842]  The reason we sell out when other big vitamin and mineral and nutraceutical makers don't,
[02:21:58.582 --> 02:22:04.627]  Is because we only source the purest, cleanest, high-quality, organic products.
[02:22:04.687 --> 02:22:14.514]  And it's really hard when you've got a formulation that's got a bunch of really great ingredients in it to get them and to always have them be perfectly clean and to be able to pass some of the highest standards in the world.
[02:22:14.814 --> 02:22:25.662]  When you go to Infowarslife.com, you can see that for yourself and find out why Anthroplex, taken by itself or in conjunction with Super Male Vitality, is such a game changer.
[02:22:26.003 --> 02:22:27.223]  This is the next level.
[02:22:28.184 --> 02:22:32.149]  And I'm so proud that we were able to bring a product like this to you.
[02:22:32.810 --> 02:22:35.433]  This is how men were supposed to feel.
[02:22:35.754 --> 02:22:40.159]  Quite frankly, I remember what it felt like to be 18 or 19 or 20.
[02:22:40.700 --> 02:22:45.266]  To be crazed, to be aggressive, to feel just exhilaration.
[02:22:46.146 --> 02:22:55.551]  And it's the super metal vitality and the AnthroPlex with exercise and a better diet that have taken me back to where I was and quite frankly beyond.
[02:22:55.972 --> 02:22:56.652]  It's amazing.
[02:22:56.832 --> 02:23:00.674]  And AnthroPlex is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:23:01.014 --> 02:23:06.517]  Men, do yourself a favor and get a bottle of AnthroPlex today and see what I'm talking about.
[02:23:07.038 --> 02:23:14.782]  All of our products at InfoWarsLife.com are recognized as safe and they are made in FDA certified labs.
[02:23:15.282 --> 02:23:21.247]  The media tries to demonize supplements because, quite frankly, Mother Nature's got a lot to offer that Big Pharma doesn't.
[02:23:21.847 --> 02:23:26.431]  But there are some bad companies out there and there are some substances that Mother Nature produces that aren't good for you.
[02:23:27.132 --> 02:23:35.459]  That's why everything we put in these products is recognized as safe and produced at the highest level, highest quality, FDA certified labs.
[02:23:35.979 --> 02:23:44.163]  Talk to your physician or healthcare provider before you take Anthraplex or any of the products at InfoWarsLife.com like X2.
[02:23:44.663 --> 02:23:46.744]  Because this stuff's real.
[02:23:47.124 --> 02:23:50.406]  Just one of the ingredients in Anthraplex is horny goat weed.
[02:23:50.686 --> 02:23:56.449]  In Chinese traditional medicine, it is recognized as one of the most powerful male stimulants.
[02:23:56.949 --> 02:23:59.670]  Not just of libido, but overall vitality.
[02:24:00.031 --> 02:24:06.473]  We put together a classic formula, souped up with the highest quality at a very low price.
[02:24:06.934 --> 02:24:09.375]  Available at Infowarslife.com today.
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:27.741]  Talk to him every day.
[02:24:28.382 --> 02:24:45.235]  I remember being in the 8th grade wearing a Megadeth rock t-shirt for peace cells with a UN building and nuclear war on it with a guy wearing a CIA badge with a skull.
[02:24:47.785 --> 02:24:59.295]  And if you told me back then that I'd be with a syndicated radio show on something called the internet with reporters in San Francisco, Skyping in worldwide with millions of viewers and listeners, I'd tell you you were crazy.
[02:24:59.875 --> 02:25:00.796]  Now I'm 42.
[02:25:01.897 --> 02:25:02.577]  And we're in the year 2016.
[02:25:02.617 --> 02:25:03.058]  And Rob Doo is in...
[02:25:08.018 --> 02:25:15.644]  Well, the place that Mark Twain said the coldest winter he ever spent was the summer in San Francisco, and viral videos.
[02:25:15.684 --> 02:25:24.631]  I'm up this morning watching Fox News on the elliptical, and I see all this footage of people being beaten, cars running over people, and I'm thinking, man, Rob, doing them, we're supposed to be out there, hope they're safe.
[02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:29.884]  And then I didn't realize it was our footage because the media cropped it and didn't give us credit, but whatever.
[02:25:30.164 --> 02:25:31.386]  He's now in San Francisco.
[02:25:31.466 --> 02:25:32.487]  He just got off a plane.
[02:25:32.787 --> 02:25:34.149]  He's out there with the demonstrators.
[02:25:34.849 --> 02:25:36.151]  I guess they haven't attacked you yet.
[02:25:36.191 --> 02:25:39.354]  This looks like a more liberal group than the folks with the Mexican flags.
[02:25:40.275 --> 02:25:42.097]  What have you witnessed last night and today?
[02:25:42.117 --> 02:25:42.477]  Rob Doob.
[02:25:43.621 --> 02:25:48.643]  Rob Dewey reporting live from San Francisco, just outside the Hyatt Regency, near the airport.
[02:25:48.863 --> 02:25:52.624]  And what we have right now, it seems the demonstrators have segregated themselves.
[02:25:52.664 --> 02:26:02.288]  You have the social justice warrior, Black Lives Matter crowd, and then just beyond, over this way, you have the pro-Mexican, anti-United States crowd.
[02:26:02.348 --> 02:26:03.689]  So they've mixed themselves up.
[02:26:04.289 --> 02:26:09.591]  We've got more girls bearing their chests here for equality, so maybe we'll go over
[02:26:10.251 --> 02:26:10.832]  Get a little shot of that.
[02:26:10.852 --> 02:26:15.698]  But you can see they blocked, Alex, both sides of the entrance into the Hyatt Regency.
[02:26:16.399 --> 02:26:22.726]  And this seems to be their modus operandi to stop any bastion of free speech.
[02:26:23.087 --> 02:26:27.192]  And I was just approached by a couple guys wearing green handkerchiefs that they keep putting over their face.
[02:26:28.175 --> 02:26:31.017]  And, uh, talking about, oh, the juice boxes are gonna get us.
[02:26:31.437 --> 02:26:32.678]  Oh, the vaccines are gonna get us.
[02:26:32.778 --> 02:26:34.299]  Hey, man, I said take your flu shot.
[02:26:34.619 --> 02:26:35.500]  Drink out of the juice box.
[02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:36.760]  No, I saw you during the break.
[02:26:36.820 --> 02:26:39.442]  Two guys, probably like 22, looked like they're about 14.
[02:26:39.802 --> 02:26:40.983]  And they walked over and were laughing.
[02:26:41.203 --> 02:26:42.904]  Yeah, there's no chemicals in the food and the water.
[02:26:43.244 --> 02:26:44.425]  The cancer isn't exploding.
[02:26:44.445 --> 02:26:45.085]  It's all funny.
[02:26:45.105 --> 02:26:47.487]  I'm surprised they didn't call us racist, Rob.
[02:26:49.159 --> 02:26:50.320]  Yeah, they did not call us racist.
[02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:51.961]  They called us kooks and crazy people.
[02:26:51.981 --> 02:26:53.662]  I got a little bit of that yesterday.
[02:26:53.682 --> 02:26:54.322]  I love it.
[02:26:54.402 --> 02:26:55.683]  I've been putting all these videos.
[02:26:55.703 --> 02:26:57.864]  We still haven't put up all the videos we showed yesterday, Alex.
[02:26:57.884 --> 02:26:58.845]  There just hasn't been enough time.
[02:26:58.865 --> 02:27:02.707]  Well, dude, your Skype was crystal clear before we put you on air, and now it's degraded.
[02:27:02.747 --> 02:27:16.455]  We might have to reconnect briefly, but we've got Peter Schiff joining us to get into the economy in the next segment, but hopefully just upload a video, you know, that you walk around and talk to these ding-dongs, and then upload that so folks can see that on the nightly news tonight, but what are you expecting this evening?
[02:27:17.432 --> 02:27:18.313]  Well, I have no idea.
[02:27:18.373 --> 02:27:21.196]  I did not expect what happened last night to happen.
[02:27:21.857 --> 02:27:25.181]  It started off, we interviewed on the nightly news, we didn't see any protesters.
[02:27:25.581 --> 02:27:32.610]  After we got done with that, they started showing up, but the cops placed a barrier in between the protesters and the Trump supporters.
[02:27:33.726 --> 02:27:35.948]  But then after it got dark, that's when it got crazy.
[02:27:35.968 --> 02:27:36.808]  People were trying to leave.
[02:27:37.148 --> 02:27:39.310]  There were people spinning out in the road.
[02:27:39.330 --> 02:27:40.591]  You can see some of the video.
[02:27:40.631 --> 02:27:46.515]  That was probably the most dangerous part right there when people were blocking streets and people were spinning out in the midst of people.
[02:27:46.935 --> 02:27:48.616]  Very dangerous what was going on.
[02:27:48.956 --> 02:27:50.337]  They started spray-painting signs.
[02:27:50.357 --> 02:27:51.558]  They spray-painted a car.
[02:27:51.838 --> 02:27:53.659]  We got a guy, he got beat up.
[02:27:53.720 --> 02:27:54.780]  Josh got that on tape.
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:56.301]  I got the footage afterwards.
[02:27:56.321 --> 02:27:57.662]  The guy had blood all over his face.
[02:27:57.682 --> 02:27:58.703]  He was wearing a Donald Trump shirt.
[02:27:58.963 --> 02:28:00.264]  And he was just trying to leave the event.
[02:28:00.948 --> 02:28:06.212]  So, and I memed that out this morning, I guess this is what they mean by Love Trumps Tate.
[02:28:06.592 --> 02:28:09.494]  You know, because as far as I know, the guy wasn't doing anything.
[02:28:09.694 --> 02:28:11.755]  He was just trying to leave the event after it was over.
[02:28:12.196 --> 02:28:17.239]  And so I guess that was the cue for the thugs out there to, you know, get money.
[02:28:17.259 --> 02:28:22.723]  But imagine if you're in your car and there's hundreds of people trying to drag you out of it, and there's a guy trying to run people over with a car.
[02:28:22.803 --> 02:28:24.184]  I'm surprised nobody got shot.
[02:28:25.383 --> 02:28:27.924]  I mean, I'm just telling you, he's trying to drag me out of my car.
[02:28:27.984 --> 02:28:29.745]  You're going to have a little Dirty Harry experience.
[02:28:29.805 --> 02:28:30.485]  I mean, I'm just telling you.
[02:28:31.465 --> 02:28:46.050]  And, you know, the protester, so I got a shot earlier, this guy popped up out of his sunroof, had a Trump shirt on, and people were surrounding him, screaming at him, and then he got back in, and then Josh got it later, where they were spray-painting the car, beating on the car, terrorizing the girl who was driving.
[02:28:46.210 --> 02:28:47.910]  For free speech, for free speech.
[02:28:48.290 --> 02:28:49.211]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:28:49.271 --> 02:28:53.512]  They were like, we're peaceful, we're peaceful, as they're beating on cars and spray-painting things and vandalizing.
[02:28:54.822 --> 02:28:56.389]  They were vandalizing the signs.
[02:28:56.429 --> 02:28:58.177]  They broke the windows out of a police car.
[02:28:58.458 --> 02:28:59.623]  Slashed tires of another one.
[02:29:00.368 --> 02:29:07.450]  Um, so I did not expect it to go that far, and it just happened, it seemed to happen magically, like it was, like it was all planned.
[02:29:07.470 --> 02:29:10.151]  Well listen, I can tell there's going to be some triggly puffs in that crowd.
[02:29:10.631 --> 02:29:15.013]  There's some new superstars we need to talk to, the ding-dongs that make fun of us about vaccines.
[02:29:15.473 --> 02:29:25.816]  We need to go, because they just worship the government, they worship the state, these are the most gullible, dumb, I mean, they hate cops, the lowest level of the government, but they love the big multinationals as their mommy and their daddy, it's crazy.
[02:29:26.436 --> 02:29:27.576]  Other points, dude?
[02:29:28.657 --> 02:29:29.257]  Well, um,
[02:29:30.300 --> 02:29:36.843]  I do want to point out, in the Facebook group yesterday, they did say they were going to shut down the road, and they did end up doing that.
[02:29:36.883 --> 02:29:37.924]  I didn't think that was going to happen.
[02:29:38.264 --> 02:29:40.965]  Now, I was reading some of the comments on this post.
[02:29:41.025 --> 02:29:46.187]  They were talking about burning tomatoes, and they've already shut down the road here, it seems, for at least the time being.
[02:29:46.207 --> 02:29:50.549]  But if you turn around, you can see the cops have also blocked off the entrance into this area.
[02:29:50.569 --> 02:29:51.890]  They're allowing pedestrian traffic.
[02:29:52.110 --> 02:29:52.550]  We'll do.
[02:29:52.891 --> 02:29:53.771]  Be safe tonight.
[02:29:53.791 --> 02:29:57.294]  We're going to be following it at Infowars.com and obviously throughout the weekend.
[02:29:58.014 --> 02:30:00.476]  We've got a guest coming up, but continue my friend.
[02:30:00.756 --> 02:30:03.398]  And come on in the next hour if you want when David Knight's hosting.
[02:30:03.418 --> 02:30:05.179]  We'd like to have you.
[02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:06.040]  Good job.
[02:30:06.100 --> 02:30:06.881]  Really great job guys.
[02:30:09.887 --> 02:30:11.327]  My name is Alex Jones.
[02:30:11.808 --> 02:30:17.749]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:30:17.970 --> 02:30:32.114]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights,
[02:30:32.714 --> 02:30:34.636]  You're focusing on fighting the globalists.
[02:30:35.036 --> 02:30:42.862]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds and the weight's going off even faster.
[02:30:43.082 --> 02:30:50.207]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[02:30:50.508 --> 02:30:56.232]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[02:30:56.352 --> 02:31:02.557]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[02:31:02.777 --> 02:31:09.019]  Check them out today at Infowarslife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[02:31:09.539 --> 02:31:16.421]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote, Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[02:31:16.521 --> 02:31:21.663]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties, or in his possessions.
[02:31:22.023 --> 02:31:25.226]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[02:31:25.366 --> 02:31:27.388]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[02:31:27.728 --> 02:31:32.972]  And how do we remove that power from Washington, to our local communities, to the individual?
[02:31:33.052 --> 02:31:34.713]  That is the ultimate concern.
[02:31:34.914 --> 02:31:41.039]  The concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[02:31:41.059 --> 02:31:43.501]  It was why the Anti-Federalists opposed the Constitution.
[02:31:43.561 --> 02:31:47.684]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power.
[02:31:47.844 --> 02:31:52.186]  But as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[02:31:52.446 --> 02:31:57.609]  But people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[02:31:57.969 --> 02:32:03.052]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[02:32:03.352 --> 02:32:06.834]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[02:32:07.054 --> 02:32:08.895]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:32:09.495 --> 02:32:11.396]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[02:32:11.456 --> 02:32:15.437]  Pro-ISIS hackers post kill lists of State Department employees.
[02:32:15.637 --> 02:32:23.999]  Hackers with a pro-ISIS group calling themselves United Cyber Caliphate distributed a kill list that appears to include dozens of US government personnel.
[02:32:24.139 --> 02:32:27.500]  The list features 43 names of people linked to the State Department.
[02:32:27.500 --> 02:32:27.920]  We're good to go.
[02:32:54.445 --> 02:32:57.407]  Many of which are general numbers of institutions or offices.
[02:32:57.487 --> 02:33:04.832]  Though several appear to be correct current office lines, the group also posted zip codes in cities often listed as Washington, D.C.
[02:33:05.013 --> 02:33:08.815]  Allegedly affiliated with their targets, but no specific home or work addresses.
[02:33:11.117 --> 02:33:18.022]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought.
[02:33:24.346 --> 02:33:27.148]  By the Military-Industrial Commonwealth.
[02:33:27.268 --> 02:33:32.631]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[02:33:33.172 --> 02:33:38.395]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[02:33:39.235 --> 02:33:40.716]  It is a big idea.
[02:33:41.777 --> 02:33:42.838]  A new world order.
[02:33:45.880 --> 02:33:48.741]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[02:33:49.462 --> 02:33:50.683]  It just happened.
[02:33:53.348 --> 02:34:07.722]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:34:07.742 --> 02:34:15.911]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[02:34:20.533 --> 02:34:21.514]  Guns will be taken.
[02:34:21.554 --> 02:34:23.115]  No one will be able to be armed.
[02:34:23.155 --> 02:34:24.116]  We will take all guns.
[02:34:24.156 --> 02:34:28.899]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[02:34:28.980 --> 02:34:30.441]  Global governance at last.
[02:34:30.541 --> 02:34:32.943]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[02:34:33.003 --> 02:34:36.665]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[02:34:36.785 --> 02:34:40.748]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[02:34:43.090 --> 02:34:47.814]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:34:53.561 --> 02:34:55.002]  I was thinking about something this morning.
[02:34:55.682 --> 02:34:58.963]  I don't think a term I've heard anybody use, but I'm sure it has been used.
[02:34:58.983 --> 02:35:02.845]  There's not much new under heaven and earth, is there?
[02:35:04.625 --> 02:35:09.607]  But that the mainstream media is committing suicide.
[02:35:11.088 --> 02:35:19.291]  Two weeks ago, the Associated Press did a national scientific poll and found that 6% of people trust the mainstream media.
[02:35:21.826 --> 02:35:25.468]  Alternative media has got a trust rate of higher than 70, 80 percent.
[02:35:25.508 --> 02:35:26.409]  We have one higher than that.
[02:35:26.989 --> 02:35:28.990]  And I'm not even so sure people should trust that.
[02:35:29.030 --> 02:35:30.010]  I hope people can trust us.
[02:35:30.030 --> 02:35:31.171]  We try our best to tell the truth.
[02:35:31.191 --> 02:35:32.032]  We're not perfect.
[02:35:32.852 --> 02:35:37.915]  But so many other big corporations and establishment groups are now posing as independent groups as well.
[02:35:37.995 --> 02:35:40.296]  So it's definitely an information war.
[02:35:42.337 --> 02:35:47.240]  But think about how passe this broadcast has gotten in many ways.
[02:35:51.243 --> 02:36:03.432]  World government, mega banks tax-exempt, globalism, the Pope calling for planetary government, all over the country they're saying women being women is now hurtful to women that don't consider themselves women.
[02:36:03.992 --> 02:36:11.938]  University of Washington is trying to ban advertisements saying, you know, join the cheerleaders and here's how we want you to dress and look sexy, you know, look feminine.
[02:36:13.019 --> 02:36:18.423]  There's an all-out attack on reality and now we learn Obamacare is going to go up again, the Associated Press reports.
[02:36:20.128 --> 02:36:25.551]  Meanwhile, Bloomberg columnist compares Trump nationalism to Nazi rhetoric.
[02:36:27.251 --> 02:36:29.092]  The EU was coming out.
[02:36:30.953 --> 02:36:34.775]  Obama and others saying, you know, it's like Hitler, not staying in the EU.
[02:36:35.355 --> 02:36:37.096]  The EU was a Nazi scheme.
[02:36:37.116 --> 02:36:38.017]  It's just crazy.
[02:36:38.457 --> 02:36:41.719]  We're going to our guest, Peter Schiff of EuroPAC.com.
[02:36:43.237 --> 02:36:47.100]  To get into the economy, boy, I tell you, it is all breaking loose now.
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:49.022]  So serious, but how serious is it?
[02:36:49.042 --> 02:36:56.107]  But I just want to ask him separately, as Ron Paul's former top advisor on the economy and things like that, what he thinks of the state of the world politics.
[02:36:58.249 --> 02:37:07.637]  500 people go out and run cars through people and bash people's heads in and attack the police and CNN says it's Trump's fault.
[02:37:07.737 --> 02:37:08.898]  I mean, it's getting crazy.
[02:37:09.775 --> 02:37:12.556]  Just the bizarreness of the mainstream media.
[02:37:12.576 --> 02:37:13.637]  I mean, they're out of bullets.
[02:37:14.457 --> 02:37:17.239]  Nobody believes them, but they still sit there and try to invert reality.
[02:37:17.479 --> 02:37:20.100]  We're going to be talking to Peter Schiff here in just a moment.
[02:37:20.601 --> 02:37:32.467]  First off, in this uncertain world, with the globalists digging in and getting storable food and armored vehicles and, you know, running around and preparing for collapse, I hope that doesn't happen.
[02:37:32.967 --> 02:37:35.828]  But I know we're sitting on top of the biggest bubble the world's ever seen.
[02:37:36.048 --> 02:37:37.069]  Schiff talks about that forever.
[02:37:37.109 --> 02:37:38.710]  Ron Paul, you know, now Trump is.
[02:37:40.461 --> 02:37:41.562]  I personally am getting ready.
[02:37:41.582 --> 02:37:44.724]  Now, I don't even have a gold sponsor right now, but I think people should get gold and silver.
[02:37:46.605 --> 02:37:48.125]  I'm on the end now that it's going to be going up.
[02:37:48.186 --> 02:37:57.591]  It's been going up, but I just, historically what's coming, paper money's going to be dead, and there's this sigh up out there, you know, that, oh no, gold and silver are going to go down.
[02:37:57.811 --> 02:37:58.932]  They're only going up, in my view.
[02:38:00.131 --> 02:38:01.912]  But I'm now digressing off another subject.
[02:38:02.192 --> 02:38:04.894]  Something everybody really, really needs is storable food.
[02:38:05.414 --> 02:38:07.795]  And I've gone out and found the very best company, MyPatriotSupply.
[02:38:07.815 --> 02:38:11.497]  We have their whole spectrum of food, updated weekly at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:38:11.877 --> 02:38:14.439]  We're allowed to offer you the lowest price out there with our distributor deal.
[02:38:14.979 --> 02:38:16.700]  They're one of the biggest in the country, very respected.
[02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:23.984]  But I got a special contract by private labeling it where I'm allowed to go 30 to 40% below the regular retail.
[02:38:24.004 --> 02:38:24.784]  That's still a great deal.
[02:38:25.004 --> 02:38:26.625]  But I can only do it a few times a year.
[02:38:27.145 --> 02:38:28.266]  This is one of those deals.
[02:38:29.662 --> 02:38:37.806]  And it's making supplies go so low because people are buying a lot of it that we're gonna have to stop very quickly because we don't want to make people wait weeks to get their food.
[02:38:38.087 --> 02:38:40.088]  We have delivery within a week right now.
[02:38:40.648 --> 02:38:43.669]  It's been freshly produced and made, super high quality, 30 to 40 percent off.
[02:38:45.683 --> 02:38:47.144]  InfoWareSelect.com.
[02:38:47.204 --> 02:38:49.925]  Select, super high quality, very, very low prices.
[02:38:50.325 --> 02:38:55.567]  InfoWareStore.com is the umbrella site, or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:38:55.708 --> 02:39:06.853]  If you haven't gotten storable foods, water filtration, firearms, a survival plan, friends and family you can count on, gold and silver, whatever the case may be, I think you're crazy.
[02:39:07.853 --> 02:39:08.753]  That's me personally.
[02:39:09.194 --> 02:39:12.015]  Because we've been trying to stave off this global collapse for a long time, but
[02:39:13.388 --> 02:39:18.376]  You look at it, it is getting more and more evident that it is a probability, not a possibility.
[02:39:18.436 --> 02:39:19.197]  Now that's my view.
[02:39:19.638 --> 02:39:20.839]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:39:21.100 --> 02:39:22.903]  It's also more important than ever to be healthy.
[02:39:24.133 --> 02:39:26.935]  And Infowarslife.com is our line of nutraceuticals.
[02:39:27.475 --> 02:39:29.157]  Super Mel Vitality is about to sell out.
[02:39:29.257 --> 02:39:31.318]  Anthroplex is back in stock.
[02:39:31.758 --> 02:39:37.342]  You can get free shipping on orders of $50 or more and 10% off when you sign up for auto ship.
[02:39:37.422 --> 02:39:40.725]  DNA Force is back in stock and so much more.
[02:39:41.125 --> 02:39:43.166]  Secret 12 is such a popular product.
[02:39:43.226 --> 02:39:45.368]  The highest quality organic sublingual
[02:39:45.988 --> 02:39:47.789]  B12 out there that's so absorbable.
[02:39:48.170 --> 02:39:57.456]  Big studies out about depression, schizophrenia, autism, you name it, from vitamin B12 deficiency because of gut flora problems not allowing its breakdown and upload.
[02:39:57.476 --> 02:40:00.998]  That's why it's so important to get it by injection or under the tongue.
[02:40:01.038 --> 02:40:03.240]  Well, we don't sell it by the injection, obviously.
[02:40:03.540 --> 02:40:08.923]  That's prescription, but this is the same stuff that is in the prescription injections, and it's the organic type.
[02:40:09.564 --> 02:40:10.985]  It's got a 4.7 stars.
[02:40:11.125 --> 02:40:13.046]  Infowarsandlife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:40:15.988 --> 02:40:16.288]  Okay.
[02:40:17.389 --> 02:40:32.094]  Now, shifting gears back into the economy, and our guest who joins us with updates every few weeks, we appreciate that, Europac.com, Peter Schiff, Europacific Capital, billions under management, predicted the 2008 crises and so much more.
[02:40:32.474 --> 02:40:39.376]  He's been predicting that QE Unlimited would work, and he's been predicting much of what's now happened, and I've got a bunch of economic news.
[02:40:39.456 --> 02:40:41.477]  After he starts breaking it down, I'm going to go over here today.
[02:40:42.478 --> 02:40:44.180]  But here are some of the headlines.
[02:40:44.540 --> 02:40:45.441]  Simply the worst.
[02:40:45.521 --> 02:40:50.446]  Obama is the first president ever to not see a single year of 3% GDP growth.
[02:40:52.975 --> 02:40:55.036]  Very, very interesting to see that happening.
[02:40:55.576 --> 02:40:56.856]  We've got other reports here.
[02:40:56.976 --> 02:40:58.957]  White House struggles to explain weak economy.
[02:40:59.317 --> 02:41:02.418]  As Obama boasts of job growth, U.S.
[02:41:02.438 --> 02:41:05.559]  economy expands to 0.5, pays weakest in two years.
[02:41:05.579 --> 02:41:07.299]  Let me just first ask Peter Schiff this.
[02:41:07.319 --> 02:41:14.041]  Peter, we know that a lot of experts use old government accounting numbers that still weren't perfect, but like John Williams and others, and they crunch things.
[02:41:14.081 --> 02:41:15.182]  I know you do this yourself.
[02:41:15.922 --> 02:41:17.265]  Obviously, these are Cook numbers.
[02:41:17.305 --> 02:41:21.913]  So, looking at this, what's the real state of the economy after seven and a half years of Obama?
[02:41:22.234 --> 02:41:25.580]  And then, obviously, they're admitting now the world economy's in deep crisis.
[02:41:26.501 --> 02:41:27.643]  Where are we going after that?
[02:41:28.626 --> 02:41:30.648]  Well, the economy is a complete disaster.
[02:41:30.688 --> 02:41:39.215]  It's actually a lot worse than what people think, because the only way they're able to manufacture the growth rates that we have is by pretending there's no inflation.
[02:41:39.275 --> 02:41:55.749]  For example, the first quarter, where they just told us that we got half a percent, 0.5 GDP growth, and by the way, the Atlanta Fed just forecasted, or not the Atlanta, the New York Fed is now forecasting 0.8% for the second quarter, so not even a bounce back, but
[02:41:56.309 --> 02:42:03.038]  The government told us that inflation in the first quarter was just 0.7% on an annualized basis.
[02:42:03.519 --> 02:42:08.866]  Now, for the fourth quarter of last year, they told us that inflation was 0.9%.
[02:42:09.226 --> 02:42:13.271]  So, theoretically, they're saying inflation went down, oil prices were up.
[02:42:13.852 --> 02:42:14.092]  I think?
[02:42:30.652 --> 02:42:31.933]  We are in a recession.
[02:42:32.053 --> 02:42:35.855]  Whether the government wants to acknowledge it or not, this is a recession.
[02:42:36.335 --> 02:42:37.816]  Nothing that Obama did worked.
[02:42:38.137 --> 02:42:43.360]  He inherited a mess, I agree, but he is going to leave his successor with an even bigger mess.
[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:45.061]  The economy is in worse shape.
[02:42:45.421 --> 02:42:46.582]  The Fed made it worse.
[02:42:46.882 --> 02:42:49.103]  And I think, yeah, they're going to be doing QE4.
[02:42:49.123 --> 02:42:50.484]  They're going to be cutting rates.
[02:42:50.604 --> 02:42:51.765]  They might be going negative.
[02:42:52.165 --> 02:42:55.069]  The only question is, will they do it before the election or after?
[02:42:55.430 --> 02:43:08.908]  Because if they go before the election, then they have to acknowledge how weak the economy is, and that undermines the message that Hillary is going to be running on, and it hurts the credibility of Obama, who's going around the world taking credit for saving everybody.
[02:43:09.602 --> 02:43:18.404]  Here's my concern, correct me if I'm wrong, but haven't they just accelerated the same policies that Bush had, who just continued the Clinton policies that set up this current scam we're under?
[02:43:18.424 --> 02:43:26.386]  A, and then B, Peter, my concern is, they say massive tax increases on middle class for the next banker bailout.
[02:43:26.646 --> 02:43:28.006]  They've only expanded derivatives.
[02:43:29.206 --> 02:43:32.527]  So my concern is about what they're going to do to respond to this.
[02:43:33.407 --> 02:43:41.890]  Yeah, all Obama did was double down or triple down on the same failed policies that brought us the 08 crisis, which is why this one is better.
[02:43:41.910 --> 02:43:44.531]  It's going to be bigger, but nobody is prepared for it.
[02:43:44.551 --> 02:43:46.691]  Look, gold is at a new high for the year today.
[02:43:46.731 --> 02:43:47.692]  It almost hit $1,300.
[02:43:48.392 --> 02:43:50.173]  Silver made a new high for the year.
[02:43:50.513 --> 02:43:51.793]  Gold stocks are at a new high.
[02:43:51.993 --> 02:43:55.775]  You know, the average gold stock has doubled in price in the last three months.
[02:43:56.155 --> 02:44:02.797]  Some have tripled, some have quite... Sure, what about the lawsuit that Zero Hedge is reporting on now, where they're basically admitting that gold has been manipulated?
[02:44:03.717 --> 02:44:05.180]  Well, who cares if it's been manipulated?
[02:44:05.240 --> 02:44:06.022]  It's gonna go up.
[02:44:06.282 --> 02:44:07.044]  They can't stop it.
[02:44:07.064 --> 02:44:08.005]  No, but that's my point.
[02:44:08.066 --> 02:44:10.611]  It proves it's gonna go up if they've been naked shorting it all along.
[02:44:11.471 --> 02:44:15.495]  Oh yeah, but a lot of the shorting has been because they don't understand what's going to happen.
[02:44:15.775 --> 02:44:17.937]  The typical hedge fund is blowing up right now.
[02:44:18.297 --> 02:44:21.480]  All the big money on Wall Street has been betting wrong for years.
[02:44:21.740 --> 02:44:23.221]  Those bad bets are blowing up.
[02:44:23.541 --> 02:44:26.024]  Right now it's like a deer in the headline moment for them.
[02:44:26.264 --> 02:44:29.286]  The dollar index just hit a new low for the year.
[02:44:29.607 --> 02:44:31.388]  We are heading for a dollar crisis.
[02:44:31.728 --> 02:44:33.130]  Gold prices are going to explode.
[02:44:33.190 --> 02:44:35.652]  I've been telling your audience this for months and months.
[02:44:35.692 --> 02:44:36.593]  I've been coming on the show.
[02:44:36.933 --> 02:44:38.094]  People need to do something.
[02:44:38.254 --> 02:44:46.837]  No, no, I told you I'm not sure, but it just seems like common sense that there's massive inflation in currencies everywhere, and that gold's always been pegged as a backup currency.
[02:44:46.897 --> 02:44:47.598]  It's going to go up.
[02:44:47.818 --> 02:44:52.279]  They artificially drove it down, but like a beach ball, you can't hold it at the bottom of the pool forever.
[02:44:53.200 --> 02:44:58.822]  The Chinese yuan just had its biggest up day yesterday since 2005 against the dollar.
[02:44:59.162 --> 02:45:00.843]  And the hedge funds are short the yuan.
[02:45:01.123 --> 02:45:04.404]  They are all positioned for the exact wrong outcome.
[02:45:04.684 --> 02:45:06.105]  There's still a window of opportunity.
[02:45:06.145 --> 02:45:06.705]  I mean, it's getting...
[02:45:07.606 --> 02:45:08.447]  Sure.
[02:45:08.467 --> 02:45:10.711]  Where do you think gold will be on December 15th?
[02:45:15.235 --> 02:45:18.997]  You know, Bob, it tends to every year have its peak in the fall and winter.
[02:45:19.378 --> 02:45:20.779]  I mean, how high do you think it'll get this year?
[02:45:21.399 --> 02:45:22.840]  Look, I think gold's going a lot higher.
[02:45:22.860 --> 02:45:25.683]  I mean, once we get through $1,300, we're knocking on the door.
[02:45:26.063 --> 02:45:30.126]  I think we can move up to $1,500, you know, again, relatively soon.
[02:45:30.226 --> 02:45:41.495]  And if the Fed acknowledges the weakness in the economy that they're still denying, when the Fed came out with their statement a couple of days ago, they didn't raise rates, but they're still pretending that the economy is strong enough that a rate hike is coming.
[02:45:41.975 --> 02:45:51.622]  You and Dent had your friendly debate here, but it got a little bit heated, and I think he's a smart guy, made a lot of predictions like you have, and I get his demographic cliff, but I agree with you.
[02:45:51.662 --> 02:45:58.747]  The fact that there's limited amounts of gold, and that everybody values it around the world, the Chinese and institutions are getting it, that's why it is going to go up.
[02:45:59.007 --> 02:46:04.631]  Scarcity means more value, and I don't see this as a dead cat bounce now, how long it's been going up.
[02:46:05.185 --> 02:46:06.906]  Yeah, Dent is dead wrong on this.
[02:46:06.926 --> 02:46:11.608]  I mean, he's basically siding with Goldman Sachs and the mainstream on Wall Street.
[02:46:11.848 --> 02:46:12.989]  He believes in the dollar.
[02:46:13.049 --> 02:46:14.149]  He believes in the Fed.
[02:46:14.430 --> 02:46:15.770]  He thinks gold's going down.
[02:46:16.030 --> 02:46:17.151]  Put all your money in U.S.
[02:46:17.211 --> 02:46:17.591]  dollars.
[02:46:17.651 --> 02:46:18.151]  Buy U.S.
[02:46:18.191 --> 02:46:18.612]  Treasuries.
[02:46:18.792 --> 02:46:19.852]  He couldn't be more wrong.
[02:46:20.172 --> 02:46:23.054]  Hopefully he will, you know, acknowledge his mistake.
[02:46:23.114 --> 02:46:30.297]  I remember when he was on the phone on the show with me, I forget what price point he said that he would turn around and get bullish on gold if it got above $1,400 or $1,450.
[02:46:30.338 --> 02:46:31.018]  I forget where that was.
[02:46:33.439 --> 02:46:34.400]  We're going to be there soon.
[02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:41.244]  So maybe he'll turn around and get on the right side of this trade, because I'm afraid too many people are going to follow his advice and lose a lot of money.
[02:46:41.524 --> 02:46:46.328]  You've got to understand what's really going on, and once you understand this, you know how it's going to play out.
[02:46:46.608 --> 02:46:47.768]  You've got to get your money out of the dollar.
[02:46:47.788 --> 02:46:47.969]  Okay, okay.
[02:46:47.989 --> 02:46:50.890]  Talk to me like I'm five years old, because I am kind of when it comes to this sometimes.
[02:46:50.911 --> 02:46:52.672]  I mean, I get it, but I want to hear it laid out.
[02:46:52.892 --> 02:46:55.954]  In four minutes, Peter Schiff, tell me why gold and silver are going up.
[02:46:57.042 --> 02:47:05.167]  Well, gold and silver, first of all, the reason that gold went down and silver went down the last few years is because everybody believed that the Fed solved their problems.
[02:47:05.527 --> 02:47:12.411]  Everybody believed we had a healthy economy, the Fed could raise interest rates, shrink its balance sheet, and that was wrong.
[02:47:12.631 --> 02:47:13.712]  The Fed didn't do anything.
[02:47:13.732 --> 02:47:14.973]  They just blew a bigger bubble.
[02:47:15.253 --> 02:47:20.096]  All of our problems were made worse, and I was saying for years the Fed couldn't raise interest rates.
[02:47:20.136 --> 02:47:20.816]  They were bluffing.
[02:47:20.876 --> 02:47:26.620]  If they tried, they would prick the bubble and the market would tank, and that's exactly what happened when they raised rates in December.
[02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:27.641]  Exactly happened.
[02:47:47.904 --> 02:47:51.487]  Meanwhile, the Chinese are selling, the Russians are selling, the Saudis are selling.
[02:47:51.708 --> 02:47:55.471]  This is going to be one of the biggest currency collapses we've ever seen.
[02:47:55.871 --> 02:48:02.057]  And the only place- Well, that is true that China, our biggest holder after the private Federal Reserve, is now accelerating the dumping and others are.
[02:48:02.457 --> 02:48:04.439]  But, so what does that signify?
[02:48:04.519 --> 02:48:07.242]  I mean, if this is the race to the exits, what's the time frame, Peter?
[02:48:08.373 --> 02:48:09.213]  You just gotta hurry up.
[02:48:09.293 --> 02:48:12.714]  I mean, it's a question of when do all the people wake up.
[02:48:12.774 --> 02:48:15.054]  It's like Wile E. Coyote runs off the cliff.
[02:48:15.094 --> 02:48:17.875]  You know, when does he look down and realize he's not standing on anything?
[02:48:18.155 --> 02:48:23.256]  When the people who hold dollars look down and realize what they own is going to drop like a stone.
[02:48:23.696 --> 02:48:29.837]  And there's, again, it's getting more and more expensive now to get out of the dollar because the dollar keeps going down, but it hasn't collapsed yet.
[02:48:29.957 --> 02:48:33.138]  Let me ask you about the Yellen-Obama secret treasury meeting.
[02:48:33.158 --> 02:48:34.698]  They won't tell us what was about two weeks ago.
[02:48:34.718 --> 02:48:35.138]  What was that?
[02:48:36.189 --> 02:48:37.610]  Well, I'm sure they're panicking.
[02:48:37.630 --> 02:48:43.717]  I mean, look, here's the prediction, I mean, the problem for the Fed.
[02:48:44.738 --> 02:48:46.740]  They don't want to admit how weak the economy is.
[02:48:47.160 --> 02:48:49.783]  Because Obama is talking about how great it is.
[02:48:50.163 --> 02:48:52.586]  And Hillary Clinton is running on four more years.
[02:48:53.006 --> 02:48:58.031]  So how can the Fed do more stimulus without acknowledging that the economy needs the stimulus?
[02:48:58.372 --> 02:48:59.473]  So this is the problem.
[02:48:59.893 --> 02:49:05.996]  And, you know, there is no solution for this, but for the investors, for individuals, you've got to take action.
[02:49:06.036 --> 02:49:14.760]  That's what the point I'm trying to make is, you know, I'm working with clients now at Euro Pacific Capital, Shift Gold, people don't have a lot of time to get rid of the dollars.
[02:49:14.820 --> 02:49:22.443]  Because when all the hedge funds that have been loading up on dollars, when they figure this out and they go to dump their dollars, there's going to be no buyers.
[02:49:22.744 --> 02:49:25.285]  So before that happens, people have to get
[02:49:25.845 --> 02:49:33.130]  Oh yeah, out of their currency, buy your gold, buy your Swiss francs, buy your New Zealand dollars, buy your Singapore dollars, use your US dollars to buy stocks over the years.
[02:49:33.150 --> 02:49:37.532]  So you really think a massive dollar correction is coming, or the death of the dollar?
[02:49:38.578 --> 02:49:45.322]  Well, look, eventually we're going to have to back the dollar by gold, or it's just going to be monopoly money.
[02:49:45.943 --> 02:49:50.946]  But in the interim, the dollar has a long way to drop before it goes into a crisis.
[02:49:51.306 --> 02:49:55.249]  But it's a long way down, and there's no reason to lose all that purchasing power.
[02:49:56.070 --> 02:50:01.994]  I mean, the big people on Wall Street who are so leveraged in favor of the dollar, you know, the losses are terrible.
[02:50:02.014 --> 02:50:02.854]  That's because all their bets are in.
[02:50:02.874 --> 02:50:03.635]  They don't have a choice.
[02:50:05.623 --> 02:50:09.305]  They're still refusing to admit they were wrong, despite all the money they're losing.
[02:50:09.706 --> 02:50:10.846]  Everybody is blowing up.
[02:50:11.167 --> 02:50:12.267]  Let me ask you this.
[02:50:12.347 --> 02:50:16.110]  Could the Federal Reserve monetize all of it as it already is monetizing like half of it?
[02:50:16.390 --> 02:50:18.912]  Could they just keep that fantasy land going forever?
[02:50:19.926 --> 02:50:23.227]  They're going to try, because as everybody tries to dump the U.S.
[02:50:23.287 --> 02:50:24.907]  dollar, they're also dumping U.S.
[02:50:24.967 --> 02:50:25.367]  Treasuries.
[02:50:25.707 --> 02:50:31.769]  That would send long-term interest rates up, which would crash the housing market and force the federal government to default.
[02:50:32.069 --> 02:50:34.349]  The Federal Reserve doesn't want that.
[02:50:34.869 --> 02:50:39.910]  So as people want to get out of the dollar, now the Fed has to crank up the printing presses even more.
[02:50:40.050 --> 02:50:41.031]  Peter Schiff, stay there.
[02:50:41.051 --> 02:50:41.951]  Stay there, my friend.
[02:50:42.391 --> 02:50:43.011]  It makes it worse.
[02:50:43.231 --> 02:50:43.892]  Stay right there.
[02:50:43.952 --> 02:50:59.783]  And, of course, I didn't intro the piece like this, but so far in this battle between he and, you know, our other friend, he's being proven right, because the dollar is starting to drop, people are running out of the dollar, gold is going up, and I just, no matter what scenario we go into, we're in deep trouble.
[02:50:59.843 --> 02:51:04.326]  But, I mean, man, we are sitting on top of a time bomb.
[02:51:04.926 --> 02:51:05.647]  Get ready, folks.
[02:51:05.687 --> 02:51:06.127]  Get prepared.
[02:51:06.147 --> 02:51:06.987]  That's all I can tell you.
[02:51:07.288 --> 02:51:08.989]  Final segment with our guest, straight ahead.
[02:51:12.145 --> 02:51:15.567]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:51:15.928 --> 02:51:23.052]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:51:23.653 --> 02:51:32.018]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:51:32.299 --> 02:51:36.381]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:51:36.701 --> 02:51:41.865]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[02:51:42.285 --> 02:51:46.087]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:51:46.527 --> 02:51:49.728]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.

[02:52:19.543 --> 02:52:27.650]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:52:27.950 --> 02:52:32.632]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:52:46.777 --> 02:52:48.518]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[02:52:48.698 --> 02:52:53.642]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:52:53.803 --> 02:52:58.166]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[02:54:38.976 --> 02:54:39.616]  We're good to go.
[02:54:57.701 --> 02:55:02.885]  From all the experts, I'm told more and more as the censorship intensifies, going low-tech internet is the way to go.

[02:55:10.070 --> 02:55:11.191]  Peter Schiff is our guest.
[02:55:11.251 --> 02:55:13.272]  Peter, getting into this,
[02:55:14.233 --> 02:55:16.934]  How does Obamacare affect things like a wet blanket?
[02:55:16.954 --> 02:55:19.315]  They're saying get ready for premiums to go up again in the Associated Press.
[02:55:19.635 --> 02:55:22.496]  How does all these different cities saying, hey, guess what?
[02:55:22.516 --> 02:55:25.037]  We've taken your pension funds from the teachers fund.
[02:55:25.077 --> 02:55:32.299]  I mean, you really see signs of things unraveling and the mainstream media trying to tell people everything's okay, but no one's buying it.
[02:55:32.319 --> 02:55:37.061]  I mean, could you argue that the depression's here, it's just not evenly distributed?
[02:55:38.154 --> 02:55:42.678]  Well, we've been in a depression ever since Obama stepped into office, but look at the GDP.
[02:55:42.958 --> 02:55:47.181]  The GDP, we've now had three consecutive quarters of declining GDP.
[02:55:47.801 --> 02:55:50.944]  The last quarter, first quarter of this year, was 0.5.
[02:55:51.024 --> 02:55:52.125]  I believe it's lower than that.
[02:55:52.725 --> 02:55:58.570]  But whatever the first quarter was, I believe the quarter that we're in now, the second quarter, is going to be lower than the first quarter.
[02:55:58.830 --> 02:56:07.917]  So this is a recession, and Obamacare is making it a lot worse because it's layering our businesses that were already uncompetitive with even higher
[02:56:08.097 --> 02:56:09.238]  We're good to go.
[02:56:38.018 --> 02:56:46.281]  So he just basically threw a drowning economy in anger when he passed Obamacare because we were in trouble and this made it worse.
[02:56:47.141 --> 02:56:54.304]  What do you make of nearly half of millennials in a national survey last week not liking capitalism and wanting socialism?
[02:56:54.644 --> 02:56:56.505]  I mean, they just seem to have no sense.
[02:56:57.930 --> 02:57:02.153]  Well, you know, no wonder they don't like capitalism, because, you know, we don't have capitalism.
[02:57:02.193 --> 02:57:04.395]  We call what we have capitalism, but it's not.
[02:57:04.655 --> 02:57:05.956]  What we have is a disgrace.
[02:57:06.376 --> 02:57:12.681]  It's corporatism, it's cronyism, it's fascism, whatever you want to call it, but don't call it capitalism, because that's not what we have.
[02:57:13.122 --> 02:57:17.105]  But, of course, if we actually went full socialism, I mean, it would be even worse.
[02:57:17.125 --> 02:57:22.088]  I mean, the problem with our economy is all the socialist policies that have crept into it over the years.
[02:57:22.369 --> 02:57:23.489]  That's what's corrupted it.
[02:57:23.770 --> 02:57:26.712]  It's whatever remains of capitalism is all we've got going.
[02:57:26.933 --> 02:57:29.290]  How far is the Dow going to go down before this is over?
[02:57:30.282 --> 02:57:30.982]  Well, I don't know.
[02:57:31.022 --> 02:57:32.423]  It all depends on the Fed.
[02:57:32.483 --> 02:57:36.906]  It all depends on when the Fed comes clean, how much stimulus they do, when they apply it.
[02:57:37.486 --> 02:57:39.728]  But, you know, the earnings aren't there.
[02:57:39.768 --> 02:57:41.289]  The corporate earnings keep falling.
[02:57:41.589 --> 02:57:41.829]  U.S.
[02:57:41.869 --> 02:57:44.210]  stocks are expensive, and we're in a recession.
[02:57:44.570 --> 02:57:46.872]  There's no real reason for the stock market to go up.
[02:57:47.192 --> 02:57:49.393]  But there's a big reason for the dollar to go down.
[02:57:49.633 --> 02:57:53.316]  And if the dollar is collapsing, people are looking for safe havens.
[02:57:53.376 --> 02:57:54.937]  And some people look at the stock market.
[02:57:54.977 --> 02:57:56.157]  But there's better safe havens.
[02:57:56.257 --> 02:57:58.099]  So is the stock market the funnel bubble?
[02:57:59.079 --> 02:58:00.541]  Sure, is the stock market the final bubble?
[02:58:01.983 --> 02:58:04.347]  No, I don't think the stock market is the real bubble.
[02:58:04.387 --> 02:58:10.155]  I think the big bubble is the dollar, the bond market, which is really an IOU, dollars in the future.
[02:58:10.456 --> 02:58:11.337]  That is the much bigger bubble.
[02:58:11.357 --> 02:58:12.299]  Sure, what about derivatives?
[02:58:13.732 --> 02:58:15.713]  Well, I mean, derivatives on what?
[02:58:15.733 --> 02:58:17.074]  It depends on what you're talking about.
[02:58:17.094 --> 02:58:19.996]  But yes, there's all sorts of credit that has been extended.
[02:58:20.016 --> 02:58:23.379]  There's all sorts of counterparty risk inherent in those derivatives.
[02:58:24.059 --> 02:58:28.963]  But, you know, the real blow-up is look at all these bonds that are yielding zero or negative rates all around the world.
[02:58:29.263 --> 02:58:33.346]  Everybody believes there's no inflation, and everybody thinks inflation is a good thing.
[02:58:33.666 --> 02:58:34.927]  Meanwhile, we've got inflation.
[02:58:34.967 --> 02:58:35.707]  It's a bad thing.
[02:58:35.988 --> 02:58:37.189]  It's going to get a lot worse.
[02:58:37.569 --> 02:58:40.451]  And when the central banks around the world have to slam on the brakes,
[02:58:40.791 --> 02:58:46.237]  And when the Fed can't slam on the brakes because we have too much debt, that's when you're going to see all the air come out of the bubble.
[02:58:46.257 --> 02:58:46.998]  Back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:47.018 --> 02:58:48.900]  Peter, I want to come back and talk about that.
[02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:49.961]  Europec.com.
[02:58:49.981 --> 02:58:51.543]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[02:58:51.563 --> 02:58:52.504]  Fourth hour starts now.
[02:58:52.824 --> 02:58:54.426]  Five more minutes with our guest.
[02:58:54.526 --> 02:58:56.168]  And then David Knight comes into the bullpen.
[02:58:59.915 --> 02:59:00.155]  Hair.

[02:59:02.276 --> 02:59:03.557]  You can't survive without it.
[02:59:03.757 --> 02:59:04.657]  But where do you get it?

[03:00:02.478 --> 03:00:07.102]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.227 --> 03:00:14.970]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:00:14.990 --> 03:00:18.853]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:20.535 --> 03:00:22.096]  We are waging war on corruption.
[03:00:22.176 --> 03:00:24.979]  I tell you, the giant facade that is the
[03:00:27.501 --> 03:00:32.363]  Wall Street globalist combine is really starting to sag in the high winds.
[03:00:32.943 --> 03:00:34.323]  And a tornado is coming down the street.
[03:00:34.343 --> 03:00:35.384]  The question is, when will it hit?
[03:00:36.504 --> 03:00:38.225]  Peter Schiff of Europack.com.
[03:00:40.065 --> 03:00:41.766]  This is the five minutes, four minutes we have left.
[03:00:41.786 --> 03:00:44.287]  I mean, I understand you don't have a crystal ball.
[03:00:44.307 --> 03:00:45.747]  We predicted stuff pretty darn accurate.
[03:00:45.788 --> 03:00:48.208]  Now you're saying, yeah, the dollar would start going down.
[03:00:48.228 --> 03:00:49.589]  You know, we've got inflation.
[03:00:51.325 --> 03:00:54.047]  But we have inflation, but we also have deflation in some commodities.
[03:00:54.587 --> 03:00:59.310]  What do you think the effect will be of so many countries announcing zero interest rates or negative interest rates?
[03:01:00.487 --> 03:01:12.272]  Remember, the reason that so many commodity prices were under pressure was because the dollar was rising, because everybody believed the Fed was going to raise rates and shrink its balance sheet, and that put downward pressure on commodities.
[03:01:12.652 --> 03:01:23.776]  Well, as people are figuring out that that's not going to happen, that that was wrong, that the Fed is going to be printing more money, that the Fed is not going to be raising rates, they're going to cut rates back to zero and maybe negative, commodity prices are turning around.
[03:01:23.956 --> 03:01:26.076]  That's why oil prices hit a new high for the year today.
[03:01:26.116 --> 03:01:26.917]  We got about $46.70.
[03:01:27.337 --> 03:01:31.457]  So oil's been going up, and of course, as I said, gold and silver are going up.
[03:01:31.757 --> 03:01:33.258]  Other commodities are turning higher.
[03:01:33.638 --> 03:01:40.239]  And as the dollar really breaks and people understand what's actually going to happen, commodity prices are going to take off.
[03:01:40.359 --> 03:01:44.800]  And all of a sudden, inflation is going to start picking up all around the world.
[03:01:45.300 --> 03:01:51.201]  And then central banks won't be able to use low inflation as an excuse to keep interest rates artificially low.
[03:01:51.661 --> 03:01:53.201]  Interest rates are going to start to go up.
[03:01:53.701 --> 03:02:03.883]  And the country I think that's going to be most affected by it is the United States, because we've got the most debt and we can least afford higher interest rates on all the debt that we have.
[03:02:06.604 --> 03:02:11.905]  One area that I know you haven't been that negative on is China.
[03:02:12.445 --> 03:02:16.426]  But I mean, just for me looking at it, it seems like that is unraveling very quickly as well.
[03:02:16.446 --> 03:02:18.286]  I mean, what's your view on other parts of the world?
[03:02:19.192 --> 03:02:22.575]  Well, I think other parts of the world are in much better shape than the United States.
[03:02:22.635 --> 03:02:28.339]  Not that there aren't problems in countries like China or like Japan or in the Eurozone, but I think our problems are greater.
[03:02:28.619 --> 03:02:32.643]  But I think part of the solution to problems in China is a dollar collapse.
[03:02:32.723 --> 03:02:33.403]  I think the U.S.
[03:02:33.443 --> 03:02:39.248]  dollar being overvalued is what is responsible for a lot of the malinvestments that are going on in China.
[03:02:39.528 --> 03:02:40.369]  And I think when the U.S.
[03:02:40.409 --> 03:02:43.711]  dollar goes down and the Chinese government stops stockpiling U.S.
[03:02:43.771 --> 03:02:52.138]  Treasuries, and allows their currency to rise, and allows their own people to be richer and have greater purchasing power, then I think that's going to solve a lot of the problems over there.
[03:02:52.418 --> 03:03:05.909]  I mean, it obviously... That's really profound what you just said, because Trump's saying they have a currency tariff on us because theirs is lower, but it's really that ours is higher, and so that's the big reason you don't have the investment, is because it's too expensive to actually do stuff here.
[03:03:06.940 --> 03:03:16.014]  Well, Trump is wrong to blame our lack of competitiveness for our trade deficits on the fact that the Chinese currency is too low.
[03:03:17.477 --> 03:03:21.843]  It's because we have too many regulations, we have too many taxes, we have too much government spending.
[03:03:22.424 --> 03:03:25.807]  And right now, China, you know, Trump is vilifying China.
[03:03:26.107 --> 03:03:29.489]  China is basically subsidizing the United States consumer.
[03:03:29.849 --> 03:03:32.511]  And that's why Trump manufactures his ties in China.
[03:03:32.812 --> 03:03:36.654]  Because if he manufactured them in America, it would be too expensive, nobody could buy it.
[03:03:37.115 --> 03:03:45.020]  And so all that happens is if you put a bunch of tariffs on China, or if the Chinese currency goes up, prices go up for Americans, and then we just stop buying.
[03:03:45.040 --> 03:03:47.382]  Sure, what about them holding off the admission?
[03:03:47.842 --> 03:03:52.323]  What about them holding off the admission that we're collapsing until Trump gets in, and then they try to blame Trump?
[03:03:53.643 --> 03:03:57.084]  Well, look, I don't know that they're going to be able to blame Trump for this.
[03:03:57.164 --> 03:04:03.046]  I think it's funny, if Hillary Clinton wins, and she inherits a recession, it's going to be funny watching her blaming it on Bush.
[03:04:03.366 --> 03:04:08.147]  She's going to try to say that, well, this is the Bush recession, and forget about the eight years of Obama.
[03:04:08.407 --> 03:04:11.508]  But I don't think anything really can be blamed on Trump.
[03:04:12.448 --> 03:04:23.515]  But once Trump gets in there, obviously if he adopts some of the policies he's talking about, and everything blows up while he's president, then he might take the blame for that.
[03:04:23.575 --> 03:04:24.616]  But it's going to be hard to blame him.
[03:04:24.636 --> 03:04:24.916]  Sure, sure.
[03:04:25.016 --> 03:04:31.780]  I want to have you on next time to talk some about how you would advise Trump, you advise presidential candidates before, and what you think is wrong with some of his plans.
[03:04:32.020 --> 03:04:32.661]  Thank you, Peter Schiff.

[03:05:10.256 --> 03:05:11.697]  My name is Alex Jones.
[03:05:12.177 --> 03:05:18.122]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:05:18.342 --> 03:05:32.512]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running 6 miles every other day, swimming 2-3 miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights
[03:05:33.092 --> 03:05:35.033]  You're focusing on fighting the globalist.
[03:05:35.414 --> 03:05:43.239]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds and the weight's going off even faster.
[03:05:43.439 --> 03:05:50.584]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[03:05:50.864 --> 03:05:56.608]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.

[03:06:08.173 --> 03:06:11.834]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[03:06:11.894 --> 03:06:15.855]  Pro-ISIS hackers post kill lists of State Department employees.
[03:06:16.075 --> 03:06:23.317]  Hackers with a pro-ISIS group calling themselves United Cyber Caliphate distributed a kill list that appears to include dozens of U.S.
[03:06:23.397 --> 03:06:24.457]  government personnel.
[03:06:24.597 --> 03:06:27.958]  The list features 43 names of people linked to the State Department.
[03:06:27.998 --> 03:06:28.358]  We're good to go.
[03:06:54.875 --> 03:06:57.839]  Many of which are general numbers of institutions or offices.
[03:06:57.919 --> 03:07:09.234]  Though several appear to be correct current office lines, the group also posted zip codes in cities often listed as Washington, D.C., allegedly affiliated with their targets, but no specific home or work addresses.
[03:07:11.181 --> 03:07:14.603]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:07:14.944 --> 03:07:22.088]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:07:22.689 --> 03:07:31.094]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:07:31.314 --> 03:07:35.397]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:07:35.737 --> 03:07:41.101]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[03:07:41.301 --> 03:07:45.162]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:07:45.543 --> 03:07:48.644]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[03:07:48.964 --> 03:08:00.048]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:08:00.088 --> 03:08:02.769]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[03:08:03.009 --> 03:08:08.971]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[03:08:25.169 --> 03:08:26.590]  We are on the march.
[03:08:26.971 --> 03:08:29.393]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:08:30.133 --> 03:08:33.896]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:34.417 --> 03:08:39.842]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, the fourth hour.
[03:08:39.942 --> 03:08:42.524]  I'm David Knight on this Friday, April 29th, 2016.
[03:08:42.584 --> 03:08:45.726]  We've got a lot of news here.
[03:08:45.767 --> 03:08:53.013]  We're going to take another look at... Actually, I want to look at how the media has reported what I would call the Dreamer riots.
[03:08:53.553 --> 03:08:59.914]  You know, they have really soft-pedaled this, and I think we really need to take a look at the reality.
[03:08:59.934 --> 03:09:01.295]  Of course, you saw some of the B-roll.
[03:09:01.355 --> 03:09:03.915]  You can see the video that we've got up at Infowars.com.
[03:09:04.455 --> 03:09:08.996]  Anti-Trump protesters riot, attack supporters, damage cop car in Orange County.
[03:09:09.596 --> 03:09:12.677]  That's an article that is linked to from the Drudge Report.
[03:09:12.917 --> 03:09:15.077]  It just says video at the top of the Drudge Report.
[03:09:15.577 --> 03:09:18.058]  I think this was huge, what happened yesterday.
[03:09:18.758 --> 03:09:24.742]  And I think, quite frankly, we haven't seen this reflected in the polls yet, because they haven't taken any polls after this.
[03:09:25.323 --> 03:09:39.933]  But when you look at the juxtaposition of what's going on in these riots that Rob Dew and Josh Owens videotaped last night, we juxtaposition that to what was going on in the Trump rally, where he has people of all different
[03:09:40.653 --> 03:09:51.777]  Backgrounds, cultural, racial backgrounds, talking about how they have been victims, their families have been victims of violent crime by these... There's a guy right there wiping the blood off of his face.
[03:09:51.797 --> 03:09:53.038]  You're looking at the video feed.
[03:09:53.278 --> 03:09:54.458]  Absolutely amazing.
[03:09:54.498 --> 03:09:55.499]  His face is all bloodied.
[03:09:55.799 --> 03:10:03.282]  And of course there's another part of the video where they've surrounded a car, keep beating it, and just paint on the car as the people are there in the car.
[03:10:03.982 --> 03:10:05.904]  I mean, this is absolutely amazing.
[03:10:05.984 --> 03:10:07.065]  These are the dreamers.
[03:10:07.105 --> 03:10:11.208]  These are the people who show up at our borders with their little teddy bears, according to Glenn Beck.
[03:10:11.828 --> 03:10:12.129]  Okay?
[03:10:12.349 --> 03:10:12.989]  No, it's not.
[03:10:13.470 --> 03:10:13.850]  No, it's not.
[03:10:13.950 --> 03:10:17.273]  Understand, the dreamers include people up to the age of 31 years old.
[03:10:18.193 --> 03:10:23.077]  These teenagers who are coming in, many of them who are coming in are cartel members already, okay?
[03:10:23.117 --> 03:10:25.379]  They're gang members already, MS-13 and others.
[03:10:26.360 --> 03:10:31.284]  So these are the people, the dreamers, at the very least, coming in here, these people beating
[03:10:33.237 --> 03:10:36.660]  People who are showing up to this rally, beating people in the street if they think they support Trump.
[03:10:37.360 --> 03:10:39.621]  Waving Mexican flags all over the place.
[03:10:39.681 --> 03:10:41.342]  You see Mexican flags everywhere.
[03:10:42.243 --> 03:10:44.404]  And demanding that they get free college education.
[03:10:44.685 --> 03:10:50.988]  Demanding that they get subsidized more so than people who have lived here all their lives and paid taxes all their life.
[03:10:51.048 --> 03:10:51.829]  No, they need to come in.
[03:10:52.209 --> 03:10:54.691]  They need to be given a free education.
[03:10:54.751 --> 03:10:56.212]  And if you have a problem with that,
[03:10:56.792 --> 03:11:00.714]  You're a racist, and they're going to physically and violently attack you.
[03:11:00.774 --> 03:11:02.915]  But of course, the media will not attack them.
[03:11:03.595 --> 03:11:04.515]  The media will pull back.
[03:11:04.555 --> 03:11:06.336]  There we go, there's a guy with a Miata.
[03:11:07.476 --> 03:11:10.318]  I gotta say, if you're gonna drift through a crowd, that's the car to do it in.
[03:11:12.038 --> 03:11:16.280]  Anyway, but look at the way that the different media have reported this.
[03:11:16.340 --> 03:11:17.360]  I looked at CNN.
[03:11:17.841 --> 03:11:20.062]  Chaos at anti-Trump rally.
[03:11:20.082 --> 03:11:24.343]  20 arrests after Trump, and then they're underneath it, Indiana Governor Pence endorses Cruz.
[03:11:24.363 --> 03:11:25.284]  See, there's no sense.
[03:11:26.064 --> 03:11:26.344]  Of course!
[03:11:45.419 --> 03:11:50.921]  More violence at the Trump rally, and so now we've got the Indiana governor just had to endorse Ted Cruz.
[03:11:50.981 --> 03:11:52.021]  That's the way this plays out.
[03:11:52.101 --> 03:11:52.702]  USA Today?
[03:11:53.202 --> 03:11:54.262]  Absolutely no coverage.
[03:11:54.862 --> 03:11:59.744]  They've got the NFL draft picks, they've got the Kardashians, nothing about what happened in California.
[03:12:00.084 --> 03:12:01.625]  Wall Street Journal, this is their headline.
[03:12:02.105 --> 03:12:04.746]  Trump rally draws supporters and protesters.
[03:12:05.166 --> 03:12:09.387]  Oh, yeah, you know, they're just standing there, you know, just with their signs, peacefully.
[03:12:09.527 --> 03:12:10.768]  That's not at all what happened.
[03:12:11.208 --> 03:12:12.068]  Not at all what happened.
[03:12:12.088 --> 03:12:13.469]  Listen to the way Fox
[03:12:14.491 --> 03:12:15.772]  Couches this in their headlines.
[03:12:16.252 --> 03:12:19.794]  Protests turn violent after Trump rally.
[03:12:20.255 --> 03:12:20.855]  There you go.
[03:12:20.915 --> 03:12:23.517]  Looks like it's Donald Trump again, who's violent.
[03:12:23.957 --> 03:12:24.958]  Trump's protesters... No.
[03:12:25.078 --> 03:12:25.318]  No.
[03:12:25.338 --> 03:12:27.079]  It's just the opposite.
[03:12:27.379 --> 03:12:30.981]  They should have said, Trump protesters turn violent.
[03:12:31.622 --> 03:12:32.002]  Okay?
[03:12:32.422 --> 03:12:35.864]  And even that would... Anti-Trump protesters turn violent.
[03:12:35.885 --> 03:12:36.705]  It's what they should have said.
[03:12:37.746 --> 03:12:39.587]  This is the way they spin it completely.
[03:12:39.607 --> 03:12:40.227]  Look at Reuters.
[03:12:40.748 --> 03:12:42.669]  Welcome to California, Mr. Trump.
[03:12:43.289 --> 03:12:44.490]  Oh, that was a nice welcome.
[03:12:45.070 --> 03:12:47.792]  No, actually, it's like, welcome to Aslan, okay?
[03:12:47.852 --> 03:12:49.773]  The Aztec land that they say.
[03:12:49.813 --> 03:12:51.934]  That's your future in America, folks.
[03:12:52.274 --> 03:13:02.980]  If you don't control your border, what we see last night, these guys destroying private property, attacking, violently attacking people while they fly the Mexican flag, screaming in Spanish.
[03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:04.161]  I don't know why they're screaming at them.
[03:13:05.322 --> 03:13:10.885]  That's your future everywhere in this country if you don't stop this open border madness.
[03:13:10.905 --> 03:13:14.527]  That's precisely what Obama and the globalists want to see happen.
[03:13:14.707 --> 03:13:17.408]  We look at the map of Aslan, okay?
[03:13:17.548 --> 03:13:18.549]  The Aztec land.
[03:13:19.029 --> 03:13:21.390]  It's everything from California to Texas in the southwest.
[03:13:21.610 --> 03:13:27.271]  All of California, all of Texas, all of Arizona, all of Nevada, all of Utah, all of New Mexico.
[03:13:27.992 --> 03:13:30.192]  This is where La Raza says, hey, we own this.
[03:13:30.252 --> 03:13:30.752]  We're taking it.
[03:13:31.112 --> 03:13:32.693]  That's what those people in California were doing.
[03:13:32.713 --> 03:13:33.973]  They said, this belongs to us.
[03:13:34.333 --> 03:13:39.934]  Get out of here, Americans, as they beat people, destroy cars, and wave their Mexican flags.
[03:13:39.954 --> 03:13:43.995]  And of course, it also includes parts of Colorado, Wyoming, Oklahoma, and Kansas.
[03:13:44.416 --> 03:13:44.776]  Why not?
[03:13:44.936 --> 03:13:45.996]  You know, just take everything.
[03:13:47.025 --> 03:13:49.587]  Then we've got this other thing from Reuters.
[03:13:49.627 --> 03:13:51.968]  This takes the cake, I think.
[03:13:52.008 --> 03:14:00.153]  You see people in riot gear, you see some cops on a horse, and the caption from Reuters is, Trump California Rally Unrest.
[03:14:00.634 --> 03:14:01.074]  Unrest.
[03:14:02.438 --> 03:14:02.898]  No, you know what?
[03:14:03.058 --> 03:14:06.640]  Unrest is what you get when your mattress isn't really working out for you, okay?
[03:14:07.020 --> 03:14:08.021]  That was not unrest.
[03:14:08.501 --> 03:14:14.544]  And let me say, when this happened in Chicago, it took several days for the truth to come out.
[03:14:14.964 --> 03:14:19.947]  It took several days for the police to start speaking off the record and say, you know what really happened?
[03:14:20.507 --> 03:14:23.649]  All the violence was on the side of the anti-Trump protesters.
[03:14:24.049 --> 03:14:25.490]  They were the ones who were attacking us.
[03:14:25.530 --> 03:14:29.652]  They were the ones destroying private property, attacking cars, just as we saw here in California.
[03:14:30.615 --> 03:14:33.678]  This happened last night and our reporters were there.
[03:14:33.718 --> 03:14:35.440]  That's why it's important for us to be there.
[03:14:35.460 --> 03:14:40.064]  There's a great call by Alex and Rob Dew to get out there and get there as that was happening.
[03:14:40.104 --> 03:14:44.068]  I mean, left here yesterday, got there just in time to see that rally going on.
[03:14:44.188 --> 03:14:46.290]  That's why we have to be there.
[03:14:46.450 --> 03:14:48.432]  I just read you the headlines from mainstream media.
[03:14:48.952 --> 03:14:50.294]  That's the way they're going to spin it.
[03:14:50.334 --> 03:14:51.235]  They're going to ignore it.
[03:14:51.655 --> 03:14:54.558]  They're going to spin it like, oh, there's a little bit of unrest.
[03:14:54.678 --> 03:14:55.719]  Not any big deal, really.
[03:14:55.939 --> 03:14:56.759]  No, it was a big deal.
[03:14:57.139 --> 03:14:57.979]  It really was a big deal.
[03:14:58.279 --> 03:15:03.300]  You need to see the hatred of these teenagers to college age, okay?
[03:15:03.320 --> 03:15:06.101]  The dreamers there, who think that they are entitled to everything.
[03:15:06.601 --> 03:15:12.462]  These socialists who come in from other countries, demanding everything, and then attacking anybody that disagrees with them.
[03:15:13.663 --> 03:15:18.324]  And this time, it didn't take three or four or five days for the truth to gradually come out.
[03:15:18.644 --> 03:15:23.645]  This time, you didn't have Ted Cruz coming out and blaming it on the Trump people, on the Trump protesters.
[03:15:23.705 --> 03:15:23.985]  Why?
[03:15:24.425 --> 03:15:25.185]  Because we were there.
[03:15:25.967 --> 03:15:27.468]  We showed you the video, okay?
[03:15:28.008 --> 03:15:31.471]  Now, let's talk about what's going on real quickly in Indiana.
[03:15:31.491 --> 03:15:36.935]  Because, you know, as I mentioned before, that's the common core path to victory for Ted Cruz.
[03:15:37.255 --> 03:15:42.919]  Because, you know, that one little state is more important than the six states that just voted in the last two weeks.
[03:15:43.560 --> 03:15:54.468]  The 57 delegates that are available in Indiana are more important, he says, than the 267 that he didn't get, I think maybe one or two, if that many, out of the Northeast.
[03:15:55.208 --> 03:16:03.198]  He is basically, as they put it on CNN headline, Ted Cruz's Indiana plan, throw everything at the wall and see what sticks.
[03:16:03.499 --> 03:16:04.920]  Yeah, that's basically it.
[03:16:05.842 --> 03:16:12.610]  He's gotten the governor, Governor Pence, to endorse him, but I think the interesting thing about this is that Governor Pence
[03:16:13.769 --> 03:16:15.290]  Can even see the handwriting on the wall.
[03:16:15.690 --> 03:16:16.710]  He's not that suicidal.
[03:16:16.790 --> 03:16:20.592]  Headline says, Pence endorses Cruz but praises Trump.
[03:16:21.313 --> 03:16:24.594]  And he begins the article by saying, well, I particularly want to commend Donald Trump.
[03:16:24.614 --> 03:16:26.575]  This is his endorsement of Ted Cruz, okay?
[03:16:26.915 --> 03:16:27.515]  Backpedaling it.
[03:16:27.876 --> 03:16:35.259]  This tells you something about how out of touch Ted Cruz and his supporters, who really think that he's got a chance, are.
[03:16:35.639 --> 03:16:37.220]  I particularly want to commend Donald Trump.
[03:16:37.580 --> 03:16:38.180]  We're good to go.
[03:16:54.651 --> 03:16:57.714]  But I will be voting for Ted Cruz in the upcoming Republican primary.
[03:16:57.754 --> 03:17:00.037]  I see Ted Cruz as a principled conservative.
[03:17:00.057 --> 03:17:00.437]  You know what?
[03:17:00.537 --> 03:17:02.079]  I don't see him as a principled conservative.
[03:17:02.399 --> 03:17:05.082]  I don't see Ted Cruz as either principled or conservative.
[03:17:05.382 --> 03:17:11.629]  I see him as an unprincipled opportunist who is ineligible to run as President of the United States under the Constitution.
[03:17:11.829 --> 03:17:13.771]  He claims to be an originalist in the Constitution?
[03:17:13.791 --> 03:17:17.374]  Alright, he still hasn't told us how he's a natural born citizen, okay?
[03:17:17.975 --> 03:17:22.478]  And then they go on to say, well, you know, Governor Pence in this article is a popular first-term governor.
[03:17:22.538 --> 03:17:23.038]  Is he really?
[03:17:23.559 --> 03:17:23.939]  Is he really?
[03:17:24.139 --> 03:17:25.860]  You know, he has an approval rating of 41%.
[03:17:26.040 --> 03:17:32.405]  There are only 14 governors in the United States that have an approval rating that's less than Governor Pence.
[03:17:33.005 --> 03:17:34.786]  There's only 14 who are less popular than him.
[03:17:35.026 --> 03:17:46.694]  Would you rather have a governor like that endorse you, or would you rather have the most popular coach of the most popular sport in that state, Bobby Knight, basketball coach, would you rather have his endorsement?
[03:17:46.714 --> 03:17:47.715]  That's what Donald Trump got.
[03:17:48.696 --> 03:17:56.181]  It's interesting, you know, when you look at what happened, the only thing that happened to Ted Cruz that was good news this week was when John Boehner attacked him.
[03:17:56.722 --> 03:17:58.503]  And he's wearing that like a badge of honor.
[03:18:00.029 --> 03:18:00.950]  John Boehner hates me.
[03:18:01.190 --> 03:18:02.251]  That means I must be good.
[03:18:02.952 --> 03:18:03.452]  No, it doesn't.
[03:18:03.993 --> 03:18:08.477]  Actually, you know, you can still be an insider and still be a jerk.
[03:18:08.957 --> 03:18:09.237]  Okay?
[03:18:09.778 --> 03:18:10.799]  That's the bottom line.
[03:18:11.139 --> 03:18:14.602]  It doesn't make him an outsider just because John Boehner hates him.
[03:18:15.043 --> 03:18:15.303]  Okay?
[03:18:15.363 --> 03:18:19.787]  And even in his denials, Ted Cruz, lying Ted, couldn't even tell the truth.
[03:18:19.807 --> 03:18:21.268]  He says, I don't know this guy.
[03:18:21.289 --> 03:18:22.450]  I've never worked with him.
[03:18:23.050 --> 03:18:28.955]  And then the media comes out and they say, well, you know, yeah, he represented him as a lawyer back in the 90s.
[03:18:28.996 --> 03:18:33.880]  He had press conferences where he spoke on behalf of John Boehner as his lawyer.
[03:18:33.920 --> 03:18:38.124]  And I'm assuming, you know, Ted Cruz goes, oh, you mean that John Boehner?
[03:18:38.504 --> 03:18:42.368]  Oh, I thought it was the guy out in Indiana, the John Boehner out there.
[03:18:42.388 --> 03:18:44.249]  You mean the John Boehner in Washington, D.C.?
[03:18:44.369 --> 03:18:45.110]  Oh, yeah, that guy.
[03:18:45.150 --> 03:18:45.771]  Yeah, I know him.
[03:18:46.071 --> 03:18:46.892]  I used to represent him.
[03:18:46.912 --> 03:18:47.792]  I used to work for him.
[03:18:48.646 --> 03:18:52.229]  We had conversations, but he pretends he doesn't know him.
[03:18:52.430 --> 03:18:52.990]  Lying Ted.
[03:18:53.591 --> 03:18:53.931]  Okay?
[03:18:54.451 --> 03:19:00.797]  But when I talk about the fact that he's not a principled conservative, just remember the fact that he has
[03:19:01.732 --> 03:19:05.955]  He voted for the TPA, the Trade Promotion Authority, before he voted against it.
[03:19:05.995 --> 03:19:07.176]  What's the big deal about that?
[03:19:07.736 --> 03:19:13.840]  Well, I mean, he's been on both sides of that issue, but when he voted against it, when it came up at first, when it came up a second time, they didn't need his vote.
[03:19:13.860 --> 03:19:16.322]  There was only four people who opposed it, and he was one of the four.
[03:19:16.362 --> 03:19:22.586]  The only one who had consistently opposed it both times, there was a couple of senators, one of them was Rand Paul.
[03:19:23.427 --> 03:19:24.347]  What is the TPA?
[03:19:24.387 --> 03:19:29.829]  Well, the TPA says we're going to ditch the constitutional process to approve treaties, okay?
[03:19:29.869 --> 03:19:37.472]  Now, that means not only the Transatlantic and Trans-Pacific Partnership, but these services treaties, even the climate treaty, okay?
[03:19:37.812 --> 03:19:42.714]  They're going to get rid of the process of ratification that's in the Constitution.
[03:19:42.734 --> 03:19:48.416]  How's that for a principled constitutional conservative to say that you don't really want to do that process?
[03:19:48.436 --> 03:19:50.717]  And, of course, he was for shutting down
[03:19:51.457 --> 03:20:01.241]  The 10th Amendment, when it came to pot legalization, calling Obama somebody who was abusing executive power because he wouldn't go down and shut down medical marijuana.
[03:20:01.421 --> 03:20:04.242]  But now he's all for that and says, oh no, that's part of the 10th Amendment.
[03:20:04.402 --> 03:20:06.423]  So now he's discovered that's part of the 10th Amendment.
[03:20:06.683 --> 03:20:07.203]  That's what I mean.
[03:20:07.523 --> 03:20:08.163]  He's on principle.
[03:20:08.183 --> 03:20:08.623]  Stay with us.
[03:20:09.003 --> 03:20:09.464]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:09.484 --> 03:20:18.267]  We're going to talk about... I don't like to sit here and have to say, see, I told you so.
[03:20:19.472 --> 03:20:46.437]  I would have rather people 15 years ago listened to me when I had FBI agents on and I had other major whistleblowers on like Sabel Edmonds who was an FBI translator who in the months leading up to 9-11 heard elements of our government working with Al Qaeda and heard elements of our government basically giving orders to Al Qaeda to protect them from the US Army that was trying to hunt them down and kill them.
[03:20:47.458 --> 03:20:57.743]  We exposed then rogue criminal elements in our government working with Saudi Arabia who ordered a stand down on 9-11 so that the attacks could take place.
[03:20:57.763 --> 03:21:01.304]  15 of the 19 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia.
[03:21:01.824 --> 03:21:09.688]  But Saudi Arabia's arch enemy, a country pro-Western in the past, compared to Saudi Arabia, Iraq was attacked.
[03:21:10.168 --> 03:21:10.909]  And now 15 years later,
[03:21:13.118 --> 03:21:15.379]  It's all beginning to come out.
[03:21:15.920 --> 03:21:21.543]  The New World Order, crime syndicate, above government, like Spectre out of a James Bond movie.
[03:21:22.611 --> 03:21:29.778]  Like Hydra, out of Captain America, is literally orchestrating the terror attacks and working with radical Islam.
[03:21:30.258 --> 03:21:32.140]  And the good news is, that's all coming out.
[03:21:32.680 --> 03:21:44.711]  And now Saudi Arabia, holding this country hostage, is saying, we'll pull our $750 billion of assets out of your nation and cause a depression if you release what's in that congressional report.
[03:21:45.752 --> 03:21:57.064]  Did you know that in that congressional report, they talked to hundreds of whistleblowers from the Army, the Navy, the Marines, and other agencies like the CIA and the FBI that told them exactly what happened.
[03:21:58.966 --> 03:22:01.248]  And if it ever comes out, it will bring down the bushes.
[03:22:02.315 --> 03:22:08.601]  The Clintons and the corrupt royal dictatorship of Saudi Arabia.
[03:22:17.909 --> 03:22:18.510]  We're good to go.
[03:22:38.760 --> 03:22:47.087]  The great time of awakening when people are going to be waking up thanks to you, the patriots around the world that exposed false flag terrorism.
[03:22:47.628 --> 03:22:53.173]  And thanks to the incredible whistleblowers that in some cases, like Barry Jennings, pay the ultimate price.
[03:22:54.114 --> 03:22:59.218]  We now are on the verge of seeing the false flag inside job of 9-11 come out.
[03:23:00.979 --> 03:23:10.288]  It's important, not from an arrogant perspective, but from a teaching perspective, to go back to media and to friends and family and neighbors and co-workers that made fun of you.
[03:23:11.360 --> 03:23:16.323]  And throw the newspapers down in front of them and say, what did I tell you 15 years ago or 10 years ago?
[03:23:17.044 --> 03:23:17.844]  What did we tell you?
[03:23:18.285 --> 03:23:18.905]  We were right.
[03:23:19.305 --> 03:23:32.434]  Alex Jones specifically sent Saudi Arabia, specifically said NORAD stand down, specifically said it was cooked up by Saudi Arabia and criminals in the Pentagon to be able to attack their enemy, Iraq, that they framed for it.
[03:23:32.854 --> 03:23:35.116]  Iraq didn't carry out 9-11.
[03:23:35.336 --> 03:23:37.618]  They were arch enemies with the group that did it.
[03:23:38.078 --> 03:23:40.940]  And we owe the million plus dead Iraqis an apology.
[03:23:41.600 --> 03:23:47.005]  Notice how the globalists hate the Iraqis, and they also hate our troops as well, and list them as the number one terror threat.
[03:23:47.726 --> 03:23:48.246]  Isn't it funny?
[03:23:49.147 --> 03:23:52.450]  We thought the war on terror was about radical Islam, now we're told it's about patriots.
[03:23:53.231 --> 03:23:53.971]  I'm Alex Jones.

[03:24:19.972 --> 03:24:21.954]  Welcome back to this fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:22.014 --> 03:24:22.715]  I'm David Knight.
[03:24:23.636 --> 03:24:27.179]  We're going to be looking at some more cruise news here in just a moment.
[03:24:27.399 --> 03:24:29.241]  Also, we're going to be looking at the EU.
[03:24:29.261 --> 03:24:31.983]  It's beginning carbon rationing.
[03:24:32.023 --> 03:24:35.607]  We're going to look at what's going on in the EU with rationing on that.
[03:24:35.927 --> 03:24:37.629]  Higher taxes on red meat.
[03:24:38.309 --> 03:24:41.693]  Bans on the sale of gas and diesel fuel.
[03:24:43.032 --> 03:24:44.813]  This is the way they're shutting us down, folks.
[03:24:44.893 --> 03:24:46.434]  It's across the spectrum.
[03:24:46.474 --> 03:24:53.257]  And of course now, not only is Britain talking about exiting the EU, but we also have Sweden now talking about it.
[03:24:53.317 --> 03:24:56.178]  And Sweden is real big into the whole globalist idea.
[03:24:57.176 --> 03:24:59.677]  But they don't like the implementation of it.
[03:24:59.997 --> 03:25:03.659]  You know, it's kind of like that, from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.
[03:25:03.679 --> 03:25:09.682]  You know, that wonderful phrase that so many, when they ask people that in college, they go around to colleges and ask people, where'd that come from?
[03:25:09.742 --> 03:25:13.103]  Most people say, oh, I think that was Jesus that said that, or the Bible, or whatever.
[03:25:13.163 --> 03:25:14.544]  No, that's Karl Marx.
[03:25:14.604 --> 03:25:16.385]  And as nice as that sounds, folks,
[03:25:17.185 --> 03:25:23.190]  It doesn't work that way in practice, because the guys who are running the country aren't Jesus, okay?
[03:25:24.752 --> 03:25:27.294]  They're not even Karl Marx, for that matter.
[03:25:27.414 --> 03:25:35.101]  Before we go back to the news, though, let me tell you we've got a sale that is ending tonight, our special, on InfoWars Select Storable Food.
[03:25:35.201 --> 03:25:43.588]  This is the huge mega-sale that we've had, with a massive discount, 30-40% off, InfoWars Select Storable Food, that ends tonight.
[03:25:44.249 --> 03:25:46.910]  That's a big deal, so we have to pull that tonight.
[03:25:47.050 --> 03:25:54.414]  It's been going on for a couple of days, but tonight will be the end of this 30 to 40% off all InfoWars Select Storable Food.
[03:25:54.854 --> 03:25:57.015]  It has a shelf life of 25 years.
[03:25:57.375 --> 03:25:59.196]  All the food is made in the USA.
[03:25:59.856 --> 03:26:01.497]  It has excellent packaging.
[03:26:01.557 --> 03:26:05.539]  Even after you open this, you can reseal it so you don't have to eat it all in the same day.
[03:26:05.579 --> 03:26:08.180]  But it will sit there on the shelf for 25 years.
[03:26:08.580 --> 03:26:09.800]  No GMO in this food.
[03:26:09.840 --> 03:26:10.701]  This is good stuff.
[03:26:10.921 --> 03:26:18.104]  It's a way to avoid getting stuck in a crisis, getting stuck with all of a sudden food prices going up.
[03:26:18.144 --> 03:26:19.384]  This is a way that you can
[03:26:21.005 --> 03:26:23.747]  Kind of even out your food purchases.
[03:26:23.807 --> 03:26:28.791]  Make sure that you've got a good backup of affordable food.
[03:26:28.831 --> 03:26:36.036]  And right now, to get it at 30 to 40 percent off, that's a great time to stock up on these foods that have a shelf life of 25 years.
[03:26:36.076 --> 03:26:36.837]  That ends tonight.
[03:26:37.217 --> 03:26:40.579]  The InfoWars Select Storeable Food at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:26:41.860 --> 03:26:43.802]  I was just talking about Ted Cruz.
[03:26:44.827 --> 03:26:48.449]  And as they say, his strategy is to throw everything against the wall and see what sticks.
[03:26:48.469 --> 03:26:53.672]  The New York Times says, as the clock is ticking down, it's a hustle for Cruz in Indiana.
[03:26:53.692 --> 03:26:58.654]  They say he's tried teamwork, setting off a fragile alliance with Governor Kasich.
[03:26:58.694 --> 03:26:59.515]  Nah, that didn't work.
[03:27:00.535 --> 03:27:09.360]  He's also recycled successful strategies from contests past, deploying his father, Rafael Cruz, to come through and talk about Christianity.
[03:27:09.380 --> 03:27:10.661]  We'll talk about that in just a moment.
[03:27:11.061 --> 03:27:16.725]  Then he elevated Carly Fiorina as his would-be running mate, and he says at a rally, they say, so how about Carly?
[03:27:16.765 --> 03:27:21.488]  He asks hundreds of supporters, coyly coaxing cheers from them.
[03:27:21.628 --> 03:27:30.475]  You know, I watched this when he introduced her, when he said she was going to be his quote-unquote running mate in his fantasy football league picks.
[03:27:31.015 --> 03:27:33.177]  And he says, she was born in Texas!
[03:27:33.817 --> 03:27:35.758]  And the crowd goes, yay!
[03:27:35.899 --> 03:27:37.940]  And I thought, what irony!
[03:27:38.020 --> 03:27:39.401]  I tweeted that out, actually.
[03:27:41.260 --> 03:27:42.461]  You know, it's absolutely amazing.
[03:27:42.481 --> 03:27:45.544]  Yeah, unlike Ted, unlike me, she was born in Texas.
[03:27:45.564 --> 03:27:51.169]  You know, it's good for him to have Carly because maybe it helps him with women.
[03:27:51.209 --> 03:27:56.734]  I don't know, because he's losing with women, even to Donald Trump.
[03:27:56.754 --> 03:28:00.918]  But it also gets his globalist wife off of the stage with him.
[03:28:01.619 --> 03:28:02.319]  That could be a help.
[03:28:02.960 --> 03:28:05.823]  And we've got an article here in terms of his dad going around.
[03:28:06.974 --> 03:28:07.354]  Look at this.
[03:28:07.394 --> 03:28:08.455]  This is on the Drudge Report.
[03:28:08.495 --> 03:28:13.197]  Ted Cruz's dad says, my son ran for president after God sent his wife a sign.
[03:28:13.237 --> 03:28:16.559]  He said, God sent a message to Heidi that essentially said, go for it.
[03:28:16.919 --> 03:28:25.804]  And I'm thinking, you know, when all this stuff comes crashing down on him, and this is all over, and Ted and Heidi are sitting around their living room, and he's going, I don't understand, Heidi.
[03:28:26.564 --> 03:28:28.105]  I thought you said God wanted me to run.
[03:28:28.125 --> 03:28:32.988]  I think Heidi's going to say, no, Ted, I said Goldman told you to run.
[03:28:34.962 --> 03:28:42.705]  I think that's basically, from their standpoint, that's really kind of the person calling the shots, okay?
[03:28:43.846 --> 03:28:49.808]  Now, when they opened up their campaigns in Indiana, take a look at what the two of them did.
[03:28:49.968 --> 03:28:51.589]  What did Ted Cruz do?
[03:28:51.629 --> 03:28:59.472]  Well, he went to the Indianapolis GOP Spring Dinner, where they had $150 a plate dinners, and he met a few people, okay?
[03:29:01.434 --> 03:29:04.555]  went to meet with the people at the carrier plant.
[03:29:04.575 --> 03:29:10.877]  He starts talking about the shutting down of the carrier air conditioning plant and moving that to Mexico.
[03:29:10.897 --> 03:29:15.118]  And he's talked about that multiple times but that's where he goes and that's the difference folks.
[03:29:15.918 --> 03:29:17.658]  One guy goes to the party establishment.
[03:29:17.678 --> 03:29:21.199]  I talked about how that happened here at the Alamo in San Antonio.
[03:29:21.439 --> 03:29:23.100]  We had a massive protest
[03:29:23.868 --> 03:29:26.369]  For in support of open carry, legal open carry.
[03:29:26.449 --> 03:29:27.709]  Had over a thousand people there.
[03:29:27.749 --> 03:29:29.650]  We had politicians all over the place there.
[03:29:29.690 --> 03:29:33.992]  But Ted Cruz was in the Hyatt across the street with a tea party.
[03:29:34.592 --> 03:29:34.912]  Okay?
[03:29:35.272 --> 03:29:38.833]  A literal tea party with some Republican women so he could get the money.
[03:29:39.294 --> 03:29:41.314]  That's what we see over and over again.
[03:29:41.394 --> 03:29:42.475]  What's happening in the polls?
[03:29:43.055 --> 03:29:44.256]  They're collapsing for him.
[03:29:44.316 --> 03:29:47.517]  The latest poll shows that he's down 8 or 9 points.
[03:29:48.137 --> 03:29:48.737]  9 points.
[03:29:48.817 --> 03:29:50.198]  And that's the one that just came out yesterday.
[03:29:50.218 --> 03:29:56.461]  I think after what we see with this Dreamer riot, it's gonna go even more underwater for Ted Cruz.
[03:29:56.501 --> 03:29:56.921]  Stay with us.
[03:29:57.181 --> 03:29:57.881]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:59.342 --> 03:30:00.242]  We're on the march.
[03:30:00.743 --> 03:30:02.343]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.284 --> 03:30:05.965]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.613 --> 03:30:17.137]  As a socialist, the word socialism does not frighten me, and I think it's probably fair to say that the Nicaraguan government is primarily a socialist government.
[03:30:17.337 --> 03:30:22.240]  That was Bernie Sanders praising the Nicaraguan communist Sandinistas 30 years ago.
[03:30:22.520 --> 03:30:31.485]  As we see today with the rationing of food, water, medicine, and electricity in Venezuela, the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people's money.
[03:30:31.705 --> 03:30:40.010]  Now Bernie Sandinista, the proud socialist, is running out of other people's money, and he's having to lay off hundreds of staff from his campaign.
[03:30:40.350 --> 03:30:40.650]  Wait!
[03:30:40.950 --> 03:30:43.392]  Can't he just create jobs out of thin air?
[03:30:43.612 --> 03:30:45.313]  Have them dig ditches or something?
[03:30:45.494 --> 03:30:49.096]  Bernie's campaign is the closest he's ever come to managing a business.
[03:30:49.396 --> 03:30:50.857]  And his business is failing.
[03:30:51.097 --> 03:30:59.703]  Even paying his interns only $12 an hour, not quite up to the socialist mandate of $15 an hour, he still can't make ends meet.
[03:31:00.243 --> 03:31:03.566]  I will be attacked by every editorial writer in the free press for being a dumb duke.
[03:31:03.826 --> 03:31:04.366]  Maybe I am.
[03:31:04.826 --> 03:31:07.248]  You know, socialism has duped a lot of people.
[03:31:07.688 --> 03:31:09.530]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:31:10.450 --> 03:31:17.334]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote, Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[03:31:17.434 --> 03:31:22.597]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties, or in his possessions.
[03:31:22.937 --> 03:31:26.139]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[03:31:26.279 --> 03:31:28.321]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[03:31:28.641 --> 03:31:33.904]  And how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual?
[03:31:33.964 --> 03:31:35.565]  That is the ultimate concern.
[03:31:35.805 --> 03:31:41.970]  The concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[03:31:41.990 --> 03:31:44.392]  It was why the Anti-Federalists opposed the Constitution.
[03:31:44.472 --> 03:31:53.099]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power, but as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[03:31:53.519 --> 03:31:58.483]  People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[03:31:58.883 --> 03:32:03.967]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[03:32:04.268 --> 03:32:07.730]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[03:32:07.970 --> 03:32:09.832]  Brainforce.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:32:10.372 --> 03:32:11.373]  Brainforce is here.
[03:32:11.893 --> 03:32:14.175]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:32:14.435 --> 03:32:22.262]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brainforce.
[03:32:23.038 --> 03:32:26.200]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[03:32:26.481 --> 03:32:26.621]  Right?
[03:32:26.641 --> 03:32:28.983]  You're gonna crash and you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[03:32:29.343 --> 03:32:32.846]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:32:32.906 --> 03:32:36.028]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:32:36.528 --> 03:32:41.332]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[03:32:41.873 --> 03:32:43.694]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[03:32:44.054 --> 03:32:48.478]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[03:32:48.638 --> 03:32:50.639]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[03:32:51.280 --> 03:32:52.741]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[03:32:52.881 --> 03:32:53.141]  Exactly.
[03:32:53.161 --> 03:32:56.923]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[03:32:57.444 --> 03:33:05.428]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:33:21.787 --> 03:33:26.452]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:30.478 --> 03:33:38.524]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, and we're going to talk this segment about Obama renewing his smart gun push for gun control.
[03:33:38.544 --> 03:33:48.271]  We also want to talk about what's going on in the EU, because I think that really underlies what we see happening, not only in Europe, but especially with the Donald Trump phenomenon.
[03:33:48.351 --> 03:33:52.213]  People are waking up to what's going on with this globalism, okay?
[03:33:52.253 --> 03:33:56.897]  He talked about when he had his foreign policy speech, the false song of globalism.
[03:33:57.674 --> 03:34:02.518]  It's a great phrase, whoever put that in there, and that is precisely what we're talking about.
[03:34:02.738 --> 03:34:06.661]  We're talking about international treaties that tie us up and bring us down.
[03:34:06.701 --> 03:34:08.062]  That was also from his speech.
[03:34:09.183 --> 03:34:12.425]  I think this is one of the reasons why we see him taking off right now.
[03:34:12.606 --> 03:34:15.408]  There's nobody that has opposed this like Donald Trump.
[03:34:16.360 --> 03:34:20.421]  As a matter of fact, Ted Cruz, before he was against it, was for all this stuff, okay?
[03:34:20.722 --> 03:34:23.843]  He was for the Trade Promotion Authority before he was against it.
[03:34:24.223 --> 03:34:29.705]  He was for shutting down the constitutional process for ratifying treaties before he was against it.
[03:34:30.105 --> 03:34:32.286]  He wrote op-ed pieces talking about free trade.
[03:34:32.326 --> 03:34:33.346]  This is not free trade.
[03:34:33.386 --> 03:34:34.726]  This is managed trade.
[03:34:34.767 --> 03:34:38.748]  And let me give you an example of how this trade is being managed, okay?
[03:34:39.568 --> 03:34:43.990]  We come out today, we see an EU calculation for handing out free carbon permits.
[03:34:44.778 --> 03:34:48.060]  Now, this is how Reuters reports this.
[03:34:48.140 --> 03:35:01.510]  They say, Europe's highest court on Thursday ruled that the European Commission's calculation for handing out free carbon permits to industries was flawed, and they raised the prospect of higher costs for energy users.
[03:35:02.010 --> 03:35:04.372]  The decision followed the court advisor's opinion.
[03:35:04.392 --> 03:35:04.972]  So here we are.
[03:35:05.372 --> 03:35:06.914]  We've got economic
[03:35:08.652 --> 03:35:14.395]  Resources being allocated by one bureaucrat or a couple of bureaucrats in the court.
[03:35:14.475 --> 03:35:17.997]  This is the court advisor who told them what to do.
[03:35:18.057 --> 03:35:23.300]  And then the court, Europe's highest court, with the EU, says, no, you're going to have to pay more.
[03:35:23.320 --> 03:35:26.102]  We're going to tax you more on that or we're going to shut you down.
[03:35:26.923 --> 03:35:28.564]  That's the way it's going to happen here, folks.
[03:35:29.064 --> 03:35:30.785]  That's what's behind this climate treaty.
[03:35:30.825 --> 03:35:35.268]  And of course, that's what the TPA is going to allow them to ratify that.
[03:35:36.124 --> 03:35:42.548]  Very easily, without having to have sixty-seven percent of the votes, two-thirds vote in the Senate.
[03:35:42.848 --> 03:35:45.269]  No, they just have to have a simple majority.
[03:35:45.309 --> 03:35:49.552]  You don't get these treaties that are coming up that the presidents want to bring in here.
[03:35:49.592 --> 03:35:51.753]  You don't get to put any amendments in these things.
[03:35:51.773 --> 03:35:52.773]  You don't have any discussion.
[03:35:52.813 --> 03:35:53.714]  You can't filibuster it.
[03:35:53.734 --> 03:35:55.355]  You can't keep it from coming to the floor.
[03:35:56.095 --> 03:35:57.576]  That's what they did with the TPA.
[03:35:57.616 --> 03:36:02.139]  They completely greased the skids to get this thing in without any opposition.
[03:36:03.052 --> 03:36:05.213]  And without following the Constitution.
[03:36:05.934 --> 03:36:11.157]  And when you look at the way that they're going to be allocating these resources, understand that we had communism, okay?
[03:36:11.177 --> 03:36:14.839]  You had central controllers who were telling everybody what to do.
[03:36:14.899 --> 03:36:18.501]  They said, we own everything and we're going to tell you what you can and cannot do.
[03:36:18.521 --> 03:36:19.322]  Okay?
[03:36:20.822 --> 03:36:29.230]  Now, you may find it strange that these multinational corporations are doing the same thing, only if you don't understand the connection between the banks and the communists.
[03:36:29.250 --> 03:36:36.196]  If you don't understand that the German central bank president, whose brother was working with J.P.
[03:36:36.236 --> 03:36:41.701]  Morgan to set up the Federal Reserve at the time, the German central bank president sent Vladimir Lenin into
[03:36:43.903 --> 03:36:50.965]  Russia from Switzerland in a sealed train with 10 million dollars of gold to start the Russian Revolution because they like that kind of control.
[03:36:50.985 --> 03:36:57.867]  See, in the past what they've done is they've used Marxism to control the people, to control the economy, to seize control of everything.
[03:36:58.187 --> 03:37:03.049]  Now what they're doing is they're using environmentalism or other forms of socialism.
[03:37:03.109 --> 03:37:05.929]  Okay, the kind of cultural Marxism that we see going on here.
[03:37:05.969 --> 03:37:07.650]  The open borders are part of it as well.
[03:37:08.919 --> 03:37:11.260]  That's why, you know, they move from red to green.
[03:37:11.280 --> 03:37:12.381]  It's just that simple.
[03:37:12.901 --> 03:37:13.841]  But it's the same game.
[03:37:13.861 --> 03:37:19.544]  And if you understand who's behind these different moves, you understand that it is the same thing.
[03:37:19.624 --> 03:37:25.366]  Even though they might, you know, they might be green now, they were in red before, they're now watermelon.
[03:37:25.386 --> 03:37:33.710]  You know, they got this thin veneer of green, but underneath, it's still the same old socialism controlled by the few.
[03:37:34.370 --> 03:37:35.331]  And it's by the corporate few.
[03:37:36.158 --> 03:37:37.979]  We're looking at what's going on in Venezuela.
[03:37:37.999 --> 03:37:41.341]  Yeah, that's communism, and it was Hugo Chavez, okay?
[03:37:42.122 --> 03:37:52.268]  But Bloomberg was bragging about how Hugo Chavez and his successor have given them 600 to 700 percent return on their investment because they understand that the banks get paid first, you see.
[03:37:52.688 --> 03:38:02.675]  So, the people may have to go to another country to get water and food and medicine, even power, but the bankers are going to get paid, and they're going to get paid 600 to 700 percent return on investment.
[03:38:02.695 --> 03:38:04.416]  I mean, that's a great deal for them, isn't it?
[03:38:05.882 --> 03:38:08.843]  You know, the World Bank comes in and they set up socialism.
[03:38:09.243 --> 03:38:10.464]  It's not the Marshall Plan.
[03:38:10.484 --> 03:38:12.284]  It's not the Marshall Plan.
[03:38:12.704 --> 03:38:18.967]  When you had McNamara doing this, people accused him of rent-seeking.
[03:38:19.861 --> 03:38:33.270]  Because what he was doing was not loaning them money so they could build the infrastructure, so they could build up their production, but he was loaning them money and then telling them at the same time, create these social programs, give people free this, free that, maybe free college.
[03:38:33.310 --> 03:38:36.372]  That wasn't on the menu then, it is now in our country.
[03:38:37.092 --> 03:38:39.954]  Give them all this free stuff and when you do, guess what?
[03:38:39.974 --> 03:38:41.735]  They're not going to be able to pay that back.
[03:38:42.216 --> 03:38:44.557]  You're just getting them further and further in debt.
[03:38:44.797 --> 03:38:45.978]  They're never going to get out of that.
[03:38:46.038 --> 03:38:48.400]  So what we see here in Europe is we see them
[03:38:49.701 --> 03:38:58.126]  Putting on these controls, these carbon taxes, and say, well, we're going to need to raise these for some of the other people, but why were they raising them?
[03:38:58.146 --> 03:39:00.288]  It's because the big guys weren't paying anything.
[03:39:00.688 --> 03:39:02.769]  They were exempt from the carbon taxes.
[03:39:03.270 --> 03:39:04.531]  So you can't soak the rich.
[03:39:04.571 --> 03:39:06.152]  You're not going to soak the multinationals.
[03:39:06.372 --> 03:39:07.773]  They're not going to pay these taxes.
[03:39:08.660 --> 03:39:09.621]  They're going to get around them.
[03:39:10.362 --> 03:39:12.063]  And so they say, well, we're going to raise that.
[03:39:12.224 --> 03:39:14.906]  Maybe they will for a little while, but they'll find a way to get around it.
[03:39:15.327 --> 03:39:18.270]  Then we look at what's going on in Holland.
[03:39:18.310 --> 03:39:23.875]  We got Dutch politicians backing a proposal to ban sales of gasoline and diesel cars by 2025.
[03:39:24.115 --> 03:39:27.038]  But don't worry, they're going to grandfather you.
[03:39:27.098 --> 03:39:27.859]  And if you've got a
[03:39:29.893 --> 03:39:30.213]  I think?
[03:39:50.441 --> 03:39:52.104]  You're not going to be able to buy them anymore.
[03:39:52.164 --> 03:39:54.687]  We're just going to force you to buy an electric car.
[03:39:54.707 --> 03:39:55.448]  Yeah, that's what we'll have.
[03:39:55.569 --> 03:39:57.852]  Until we force you to give up your electric car.
[03:39:57.872 --> 03:40:01.858]  Until we say we're not going to allow private ownership of any kind of transportation.
[03:40:01.878 --> 03:40:02.900]  Because we want to control you.
[03:40:03.908 --> 03:40:05.829]  And that's what's going on right now in this country.
[03:40:05.889 --> 03:40:18.354]  We've got a federal government under Obama that is not only subsidizing automated cars, but now we've got a massive lobbyist group, like I mentioned yesterday when I was talking to Anthony Gucciardi here on the fourth hour.
[03:40:18.774 --> 03:40:25.577]  We've got a new lobbying group called the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, and it is Google,
[03:40:26.397 --> 03:40:28.879]  Ford and Volvo, Uber and Lyft.
[03:40:29.119 --> 03:40:31.760]  And we look at this, it's like, okay, that makes sense.
[03:40:31.880 --> 03:40:34.422]  These guys, oh, they're trying to make us safer?
[03:40:34.442 --> 03:40:34.482]  No.
[03:40:35.022 --> 03:40:42.627]  What they're doing is they're going to the federal government, just like they did, like big agricultural interests did with GMO and saying, we don't want
[03:40:43.527 --> 03:40:45.529]  Local regulations of what we do.
[03:40:45.790 --> 03:40:56.722]  And so we're going to come to the federal government and we're going to say to the federal government, give us some regulations, which are not regulations at all, and say that supersedes any regulations at the state area.
[03:40:56.742 --> 03:40:58.585]  In other words, shutting down the 9th and the 10th Amendment.
[03:40:59.125 --> 03:41:03.809]  So it's blatantly unconstitutional, it's crony capitalism, it is not about safety.
[03:41:03.849 --> 03:41:16.560]  The reason they're going to Washington now is because California has seen the results of what's happening with these Google cars and they're putting the brakes on and saying, hey wait a minute, we need a person in the cars to back up because we're not happy with what you've done.
[03:41:16.880 --> 03:41:24.406]  They do these, they're telling us how advanced these are and how safe they're going to be and they show us all these pictures of how they've got sensors here and sensors there.
[03:41:25.527 --> 03:41:33.198]  Google just filed a patent to say that they're going to be able to quote-unquote predict human behavior by looking at brake lights and turn signals.
[03:41:33.979 --> 03:41:35.361]  That's how ridiculous this is!
[03:41:36.414 --> 03:41:37.414]  That's how ridiculous it is.
[03:41:37.494 --> 03:41:39.055]  But they're selling it in the name of safety.
[03:41:39.075 --> 03:41:43.195]  But it's really crony capitalism for the corporations and its government control.
[03:41:43.295 --> 03:41:46.056]  And that's what's going on all over the EU.
[03:41:46.256 --> 03:41:49.136]  That's why Britain is having a vote on whether or not they're going to exit.
[03:41:49.697 --> 03:41:54.538]  As The New American points out, the Swedes may follow Britain if it exits the EU.
[03:41:54.578 --> 03:41:57.198]  They say, Swedes tell Britain, if you leave, the EU will follow.
[03:41:57.238 --> 03:42:01.579]  That's the title of a recent article out of The Spectator, a British newspaper.
[03:42:02.159 --> 03:42:14.345]  And they say, well, you know, Britain may be one of the least enthusiastic members of the EU, but other, even more globally-minded countries, like Sweden, are tiring of the protectionism and the insularity in Brussels.
[03:42:14.365 --> 03:42:18.086]  In other words, Brussels is telling people what they can and cannot do.
[03:42:18.566 --> 03:42:21.968]  And it doesn't matter if it's the Kremlin or if it's Brussels.
[03:42:22.268 --> 03:42:26.190]  When you have centralized control of your economy, that's what's going to happen.
[03:42:27.250 --> 03:42:30.253]  Denmark shutting down red meat, okay?
[03:42:30.433 --> 03:42:32.915]  Again, taxing it like they did gasoline.
[03:42:33.456 --> 03:42:36.859]  Eventually, they'll come to just saying, no, you can't have red meat.
[03:42:37.119 --> 03:42:41.984]  And of course, it's all about ethical concerns of climate change, okay?
[03:42:42.044 --> 03:42:44.546]  That should be red meat to the opposition.
[03:42:44.847 --> 03:42:45.847]  And that's why we're seeing
[03:42:46.508 --> 03:42:50.809]  That, combined with the open borders, is why you're seeing the rise of Donald Trump.
[03:42:50.869 --> 03:42:58.491]  It's why you're seeing the rise of people, political parties, throughout Europe, and why you're seeing the fall of the people who are supporting this kind of stuff.
[03:42:58.691 --> 03:43:04.333]  Now, coming back to our own country here, and as we look at this next election, it's going to be coming up on Tuesday in Indiana.
[03:43:05.615 --> 03:43:08.199]  Crowd for cruise rally is less than expected.
[03:43:08.279 --> 03:43:11.022]  This has come from WANE in Indiana.
[03:43:11.643 --> 03:43:18.733]  They say a person there, Brenda Mosbarger, took a break from work to snap a few photos of the hoopla outside the Grand Wayne Center.
[03:43:18.753 --> 03:43:20.596]  She said she didn't see much that was happening there.
[03:43:20.636 --> 03:43:21.477]  This is a cruise rally.
[03:43:21.517 --> 03:43:21.977]  She says, well,
[03:43:22.738 --> 03:43:28.300]  I guess I was just expecting to see some spillover, maybe people waiting to get in, but it seems to be pretty quiet.
[03:43:28.781 --> 03:43:34.303]  They say, yeah, it's a pretty big place, but inside the center only about a thousand supporters came to see Ted Cruz.
[03:43:34.363 --> 03:43:35.683]  It's only about half full.
[03:43:36.304 --> 03:43:41.026]  One person, Joseph Romary, says, I was surprised how few people were there.
[03:43:41.046 --> 03:43:42.346]  He says, I mean, it's a big room.
[03:43:43.467 --> 03:43:45.447]  See, the crowds are collapsing.
[03:43:46.008 --> 03:43:51.350]  Donald Trump is getting tens of thousands and Ted Cruz can only half fill the rooms that he's got.
[03:43:52.014 --> 03:43:53.575]  And you see it reflected in the polls as well.
[03:43:53.595 --> 03:44:03.658]  If you look at real clear politics, and they take the average of recent polls, they range from 2, 5, 8, 6, Trump ahead that much.
[03:44:03.818 --> 03:44:04.558]  Average of 5.3.
[03:44:04.859 --> 03:44:06.999]  Actually, the one that came out today, which was just taken, was
[03:44:10.011 --> 03:44:15.055]  27th to 28th, so it's Wednesday and Thursday, and that was before the Dreamer riot.
[03:44:15.555 --> 03:44:19.678]  We had Donald Trump plus 9 over Ted Cruz.
[03:44:20.218 --> 03:44:21.980]  And it's not just Ted Cruz who's collapsing.
[03:44:22.020 --> 03:44:29.045]  I thought it was interesting to see this article on the Daily Caller about Glenn Beck, because Glenn Beck has been his sidekick.
[03:44:29.125 --> 03:44:36.010]  I guess maybe he got kicked to the side a little bit after Carly got on board, or maybe he's had to dial it back because he's had to lay off
[03:44:37.131 --> 03:44:38.633]  40 people from the blaze!
[03:44:38.793 --> 03:44:45.442]  And he says, yeah, I've laid off 40 people and my media empire is crumbling and part of it is because I'm traveling around with Ted Cruz.
[03:44:46.083 --> 03:44:49.047]  Well, it may also be because he tied himself to that anchor.
[03:44:49.447 --> 03:44:51.450]  And you know, it's not something that just started.
[03:44:53.302 --> 03:45:04.285]  When Glenn Beck came out and tagged all the people at the Bundy standoff as terrorists, that's, I think, he took a big hit for that.
[03:45:04.846 --> 03:45:06.766]  And I don't think he's really recovered from that.
[03:45:06.906 --> 03:45:18.110]  And it's only getting worse when he goes to the border with teddy bears to welcome in the people that you saw rioting yesterday in Orange County, that we had video of.
[03:45:19.076 --> 03:45:23.018]  Now, all this stuff is being sold to us as they are in Europe.
[03:45:23.078 --> 03:45:27.059]  They're selling people on the safety of the smart cars.
[03:45:27.639 --> 03:45:30.320]  They're selling us on smart cities.
[03:45:30.340 --> 03:45:32.441]  They say, yeah, of course, that's all about Agenda 21.
[03:45:32.481 --> 03:45:34.302]  They're going to have smart buses.
[03:45:34.322 --> 03:45:35.503]  We talked about that yesterday.
[03:45:35.523 --> 03:45:38.864]  You know, the empty buses now won't even have a driver on them.
[03:45:39.664 --> 03:45:43.926]  And Elon Musk is saying, oh, we're going to come up with some kind of special bus for people as well.
[03:45:45.046 --> 03:45:51.090]  So they're pushing all this stuff because they've got smart cars, smart cities, and now smart guns.
[03:45:51.490 --> 03:45:59.335]  Understand when they start talking to you about smart cars and smart guns and smart cities, they think you're really stupid.
[03:46:00.076 --> 03:46:04.819]  They think you really don't know that this is about crony capitalism and government control.
[03:46:05.139 --> 03:46:09.962]  And so today we've got Obama renewing his push for smart guns.
[03:46:10.462 --> 03:46:11.823]  And again he's putting this out.
[03:46:11.943 --> 03:46:12.564]  What if
[03:46:13.789 --> 03:46:15.690]  We use these common sense steps, he says.
[03:46:15.870 --> 03:46:21.753]  And he says these common sense steps are not going to prevent every tragedy, but what if they prevented just one?
[03:46:21.773 --> 03:46:25.895]  And he puts that out on Facebook, and he's got a large plan here that I'm looking at.
[03:46:25.915 --> 03:46:35.499]  I would ask him this, well, what if one citizen, even one law enforcement officer, got killed?
[03:46:36.239 --> 03:46:37.800]  Because their gun wouldn't work, Obama.
[03:46:38.540 --> 03:46:41.742]  And he's putting this out, and the way he's going to push this to people,
[03:46:43.089 --> 03:46:48.734]  It's to say they're going to fund this, they're going to offer some, they're going to throw tens of millions of dollars at this.
[03:46:48.754 --> 03:46:53.018]  They're not going to mandate that you have to have this yet.
[03:46:53.338 --> 03:46:56.561]  They're not going to mandate that law enforcement has to have this yet.
[03:46:57.041 --> 03:47:08.190]  What they're going to do is, with crony capitalism again, just like we see with the smart cars, with self-driving cars, they're going to throw some money out there, they're going to find some corporations that they can partner with.
[03:47:09.051 --> 03:47:11.273]  And then they're going to come up with something.
[03:47:11.633 --> 03:47:14.616]  Maybe they'll have some tech that works, maybe they won't.
[03:47:14.896 --> 03:47:15.257]  Okay?
[03:47:15.397 --> 03:47:17.979]  And then at that point, they'll start coming in with the mandates.
[03:47:18.039 --> 03:47:20.081]  I talked about this a while back.
[03:47:20.141 --> 03:47:21.602]  I did a report a couple of months ago.
[03:47:21.903 --> 03:47:23.844]  Smart guns, dumb and dumber.
[03:47:23.864 --> 03:47:28.869]  And I want to play just a little bit of that for you to give you an idea of what's wrong with smart guns.
[03:47:30.265 --> 03:47:37.079]  To help push the idea of smart guns, mainstream media, from Fox News to CNN, turns to James Bond as an example.
[03:47:41.794 --> 03:47:58.287]  While having a gun that only authorized users can fire might sound like a great idea, Bond has lots of gadgets that, in the real world, would be impractical and prohibitively expensive to build.
[03:47:58.628 --> 03:48:01.230]  But Obama says the tech hurdles can be overcome.
[03:48:01.770 --> 03:48:06.214]  If you are a gun owner, I would think that you would at least want a choice.
[03:48:06.654 --> 03:48:08.255]  They don't want to be in a situation where
[03:48:09.076 --> 03:48:10.717]  Oh no, someone's coming through my front door.
[03:48:10.737 --> 03:48:11.898]  I've got to reboot my gun.
[03:48:12.098 --> 03:48:13.639]  It's the reliability, stupid.
[03:48:14.059 --> 03:48:22.023]  Adding biometric or RFID sensors to a gun means adding multiple layers of new complicated technology that can go wrong.
[03:48:22.303 --> 03:48:28.787]  The blinking red LED light means that you have 33% battery life left and you must change the batteries.
[03:48:28.907 --> 03:48:30.388]  There weren't batteries that were small enough.
[03:48:30.448 --> 03:48:33.629]  There weren't chips that were reliable enough.
[03:48:33.829 --> 03:48:38.412]  There wasn't biometric technology that was good enough to recognize fingerprint IDs.
[03:48:38.732 --> 03:48:41.314]  Guns are finely honed mechanical devices.
[03:48:41.674 --> 03:48:42.215]  They're rugged.
[03:48:42.415 --> 03:48:43.936]  They can withstand rough use.
[03:48:44.557 --> 03:48:49.761]  Smart guns will add electronics that can fail, can break, that will need a charged power source.
[03:48:50.261 --> 03:48:53.984]  And most importantly, they can be disabled by criminals or governments.
[03:48:54.544 --> 03:49:02.190]  This vulnerability and others will come from the software, which will also have bugs that will get worse with software updates, just like your phone.
[03:49:02.671 --> 03:49:03.792]  And there are other concerns.
[03:49:04.412 --> 03:49:09.054]  Any wireless coupling can decouple, it can have interference, or it can be hacked.
[03:49:09.474 --> 03:49:14.317]  And will you grip a biometric handle in the same way when you're under stress or under combat?
[03:49:14.837 --> 03:49:17.358]  So far there's only been one attempt at a smart gun.
[03:49:17.878 --> 03:49:20.560]  The IP-1 from the German manufacturer Armitix.
[03:49:20.820 --> 03:49:29.524]  The gun is implanted with an electronic chip that allows it to be fired only if the shooter is wearing a companion watch into which a PIN number has been entered.
[03:49:29.904 --> 03:49:39.127]  It was only offered in a .22 caliber, but it cost $1,800, five times the cost of other .22s, and not offered in a self-defense caliber.
[03:49:39.387 --> 03:49:40.327]  But it had other problems.
[03:49:40.587 --> 03:49:43.908]  It took seven push-button commands and 12 seconds before it could be fired.
[03:49:44.268 --> 03:49:49.110]  And it had three or four misfires per 11-round magazine, repeatedly.
[03:49:49.850 --> 03:49:50.750]  So, it's not good.
[03:49:50.990 --> 03:49:51.331]  It's not bad.
[03:49:51.351 --> 03:49:52.631]  Okay, so you can hear that report.
[03:49:52.691 --> 03:49:55.572]  You can find that at Alex Jones' YouTube channel.
[03:49:55.612 --> 03:49:57.673]  It's Smart Guns, Dumb and Dumber.
[03:49:58.313 --> 03:50:01.495]  That's something you really need to look at because that's something they're going to hit us pretty hard with.
[03:50:01.515 --> 03:50:02.975]  They're going to throw a lot of money at that.
[03:50:02.995 --> 03:50:09.018]  Of course, we're going to borrow money from the Chinese so we can develop this technology that is going to be less reliable.
[03:50:09.038 --> 03:50:13.980]  Look, it's inevitable that when you make something that's a lot more complicated, it's going to be less reliable.
[03:50:14.580 --> 03:50:24.845]  And the thing that you need to have the most reliability for is the thing that you're using in a panic situation to try to save your life for the life of other people.
[03:50:25.145 --> 03:50:26.186]  That's what you've got guns for.
[03:50:26.266 --> 03:50:27.547]  You're going to be under a lot of pressure.
[03:50:27.907 --> 03:50:40.473]  You don't need to have the complications of something that operates with software, with additional electronics, and additionally to anything that, like mechanical, that could go wrong with a gun.
[03:50:40.493 --> 03:50:43.575]  You want something that is solid, that is reliable.
[03:50:44.315 --> 03:50:46.298]  Now, when we come back, I want to take a couple of calls.
[03:50:46.319 --> 03:50:52.929]  We've only got one segment, but if you want to jump in on anything we've talked about, about the guns, about EU, the number to call in will be 800-259-9231.
[03:50:52.989 --> 03:50:53.170]  That's 800-259-9231.
[03:50:53.250 --> 03:50:53.911]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:10.475 --> 03:51:13.758]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[03:51:13.938 --> 03:51:16.200]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[03:51:16.381 --> 03:51:24.768]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[03:51:25.029 --> 03:51:30.614]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it after consulting top doctors, nutritionists,
[03:51:30.774 --> 03:51:46.447]  Pharmacist and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[03:51:46.647 --> 03:51:48.509]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[03:51:48.869 --> 03:51:56.517]  Supermail Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[03:51:56.817 --> 03:52:02.983]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[03:52:03.303 --> 03:52:10.230]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Supermail Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[03:52:10.470 --> 03:52:11.491]  BrainForce is here.
[03:52:12.011 --> 03:52:14.293]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:52:14.573 --> 03:52:22.378]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[03:52:23.174 --> 03:52:26.336]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[03:52:26.616 --> 03:52:26.736]  Right?
[03:52:26.756 --> 03:52:29.098]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[03:52:29.458 --> 03:52:32.980]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:52:33.040 --> 03:52:36.162]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:52:36.662 --> 03:52:41.465]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[03:52:42.005 --> 03:52:43.846]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[03:52:44.186 --> 03:52:48.569]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[03:52:48.769 --> 03:52:50.811]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[03:52:51.392 --> 03:52:52.874]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[03:52:53.014 --> 03:52:53.274]  Exactly.
[03:52:53.294 --> 03:52:57.259]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[03:52:57.599 --> 03:53:05.568]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:53:10.325 --> 03:53:17.212]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote, Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[03:53:17.312 --> 03:53:22.477]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties, or in his possessions.
[03:53:22.817 --> 03:53:26.020]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[03:53:26.160 --> 03:53:28.222]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[03:53:28.522 --> 03:53:33.767]  And how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual?
[03:53:33.847 --> 03:53:35.429]  That is the ultimate concern.
[03:53:35.689 --> 03:53:41.817]  The concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[03:53:41.837 --> 03:53:44.280]  It was why the Anti-Federalists opposed the Constitution.
[03:53:44.340 --> 03:53:52.971]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power, but as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[03:53:53.371 --> 03:53:58.377]  People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[03:53:58.757 --> 03:54:03.842]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[03:54:04.143 --> 03:54:07.627]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[03:54:07.847 --> 03:54:09.689]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:54:21.540 --> 03:54:22.781]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:22.801 --> 03:54:24.863]  In our last segment, I'm going to take some calls here.
[03:54:24.883 --> 03:54:32.029]  Also want to remind you that tonight is the end of the InfoWars Mega Sale on select storable food.
[03:54:32.069 --> 03:54:34.572]  That's 30 to 40 percent off all storable food.
[03:54:34.612 --> 03:54:35.693]  That ends tonight.
[03:54:35.793 --> 03:54:37.294]  We've only had that up for a couple of days.
[03:54:37.775 --> 03:54:41.218]  We can't keep a sale like this going, so it will end tonight.

[03:54:45.459 --> 03:54:47.059]  Shelf life of 25 years.

[03:55:43.689 --> 03:55:46.290]  Let's go to your calls now, Stephen in Florida.
[03:55:46.310 --> 03:55:48.431]  Stephen, you want to talk about Ted Cruz, it says.
[03:55:48.451 --> 03:55:48.691]  Go ahead.
[03:55:50.120 --> 03:55:51.360]  Yeah, hi, David.
[03:55:51.460 --> 03:55:55.662]  Yeah, you know, I want to say this, and I know I'm speaking to a brother in Christ.
[03:55:56.502 --> 03:56:03.244]  Ted Cruz is as phony as a $3 bill when it comes to being a Christian, for all the reasons you guys are bringing out.
[03:56:03.284 --> 03:56:09.746]  You know, originally I was supportive of this man, along with Rand Paul for president, and Rand, of course, dropped out.
[03:56:09.867 --> 03:56:17.329]  But, you know, the thing I want to say is that, you know, I'm getting this from Christians that I'm tied to in the Christian community at large.
[03:56:17.870 --> 03:56:19.151]  This gets to a bigger issue.
[03:56:19.231 --> 03:56:29.496]  That will support Cruz, solely because he's a professing, born-again Christian, without looking at what he's been involved in, the real issues.
[03:56:30.157 --> 03:56:32.178]  And, you know, the thing is, I want to say this.
[03:56:32.298 --> 03:56:33.419]  This is evidence.
[03:56:33.619 --> 03:56:37.801]  Ted Cruz is the symptom of the larger picture, which is this.
[03:56:38.341 --> 03:56:43.824]  You know, in the Bible, there's a principle where the spiritual precedes what goes on in the natural.
[03:56:44.125 --> 03:56:46.606]  The Church is to be the conscience of the nation.
[03:56:47.173 --> 03:57:01.100]  And the reason we've got so many people in America so dumbed down and stupefied and zombified in the natural is because in the spiritual this has taken place, where Christians believe in this pre-trib rapture fantasy, because here's what I'm hearing.
[03:57:01.440 --> 03:57:05.762]  I bring up in church about voting, and a woman says, I vote for the rapture.
[03:57:05.782 --> 03:57:10.784]  Oh, I can see, you know, another guy says in church, I can see God's hand in ISIS.
[03:57:11.625 --> 03:57:14.046]  It's evident that the coming of the Lord is imminent.
[03:57:14.465 --> 03:57:16.767]  You know, well, go ahead and put the chip in me.
[03:57:16.807 --> 03:57:19.490]  I heard a preacher say this last year, because you know what?
[03:57:19.690 --> 03:57:21.012]  That's not the mark of the beast.
[03:57:21.092 --> 03:57:23.414]  Now I know that because I'm not going to be here when they issue it.
[03:57:23.734 --> 03:57:36.567]  And so what I'm saying, brother, is we've got this fantasy among Christians in America who ought to be the most aware and awake to what's going on and the most involved, and yet the majority of Christians have this, don't bother me with politics,
[03:57:36.972 --> 03:57:57.778]  I don't want to get involved, and so all I can say is when it comes to you, because of big decisions that are being made by those in power and in authority, and it affects you, and they drag you off to one of the FEMA camps and do horrible things to your family like they're doing in foreign countries now, don't say you weren't one, because it's all in the Bible that you claim to believe.
[03:57:57.938 --> 03:57:59.258]  I couldn't agree with you more, Stephen.
[03:57:59.438 --> 03:58:00.819]  And I have to say to people, look.
[03:58:01.599 --> 03:58:07.765]  If you're a Christian, as I look at Francis Schaeffer and others who have said, alright, so we're safe, so how do we live?
[03:58:08.526 --> 03:58:10.668]  Aren't you called to protect the innocent?
[03:58:10.728 --> 03:58:15.372]  How can you turn your back on people and say, hey, I don't care what happens to them, rapture's coming or whatever, okay?
[03:58:15.852 --> 03:58:20.036]  It looked like the rapture was coming to a lot of people when Adolf Hitler was going through Europe, didn't it?
[03:58:20.857 --> 03:58:23.818]  You can't predict when it's going to happen.
[03:58:23.858 --> 03:58:25.359]  You don't know when it's going to happen.
[03:58:25.399 --> 03:58:34.243]  You have some clear moral principles, and I think the thing that has been the most devastating is that people look to political leaders for spiritual guidance.
[03:58:34.503 --> 03:58:35.543]  That's the key thing there.
[03:58:35.844 --> 03:58:37.504]  Join us tonight, 7 central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:37.544 --> 03:58:38.665]  Eastern, for the Nightly News.
