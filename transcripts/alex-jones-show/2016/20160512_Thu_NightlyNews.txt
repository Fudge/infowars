[00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:21.632]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.672 --> 00:00:25.474]  It is Thursday, May 12, 2016, and I'm Leigh-Anne McAdoo.
[00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:26.855]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:30.978 --> 00:00:31.378]  Tonight...
[00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:38.232]  Law enforcement professionals say that the fear of going viral impacts their work.
[00:00:38.892 --> 00:00:48.301]  To that I quote Stephen Colbert, if you're doing nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide from the giant surveillance apparatus the government's been hiding.
[00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:53.225]  After that, veterans speak out about problems in the military.
[00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:57.629]  And why the new film Amerigeddon is so important.
[00:00:58.169 --> 00:00:58.790]  That's next.
[00:01:00.137 --> 00:01:02.778]  The average American family only has three days of food.
[00:01:03.298 --> 00:01:04.618]  We need to talk face-to-face.
[00:01:04.638 --> 00:01:05.959]  This is important.
[00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:07.259]  Sir, what's the mission?
[00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:09.880]  Disarm the population and restore order!
[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.241]  Do you have any weapons inside your home on you personally?
[00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:19.263]  You had to give the President power to arrest any American by simply accusing them of terrorism.
[00:01:19.783 --> 00:01:22.344]  The vanity of nationalism will quickly fade.
[00:01:22.664 --> 00:01:24.345]  The ease of at the birth pangs.
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:03.346 --> 00:03:15.753]  Well, we've been witnessing a lot of political infighting this election cycle, and none of that has been more evident as the recent infighting with the Republican Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, refusing to back Donald Trump.
[00:03:16.113 --> 00:03:20.876]  Well, seems like all of that has changed after the two met this week in D.C.
[00:03:21.256 --> 00:03:27.440]  They released a joint statement saying that they decided it's really important that the party unites
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.900]  I think so.
[00:03:45.632 --> 00:03:49.814]  But it seems as though Donald Trump still has the edge here in this meeting.
[00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:58.738]  We know that's how he kind of goes into these business deals because the millions of voters who are backing Trump, they want immigration enforcement and fair trade deals.
[00:03:58.878 --> 00:04:03.660]  And this is key because these are both things which Ryan has worked against.
[00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:06.262]  Joining me now is InfoWars writer Kit Daniels.
[00:04:06.322 --> 00:04:09.503]  Now Kit, is Ryan going to stop moving against Donald Trump behind closed doors?
[00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:10.624]  And what is the deal?
[00:04:10.704 --> 00:04:12.965]  Why won't he or Vicente Fox back Trump?
[00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.372]  Well, it certainly seems like Vicente Fox and Paul Ryan, they love violent illegals more so than Trump.
[00:04:18.933 --> 00:04:19.493]  Here's why.
[00:04:19.513 --> 00:04:23.415]  Vicente Fox, he's a good example of a globalist.
[00:04:23.455 --> 00:04:36.541]  Back, I believe, in 2005, during the George W. Bush administration, he was lobbying the White House to go public about the North American Union, which is a plan by the globalists to practically erase the borders between the US, Canada, and Mexico.
[00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:40.563]  Pretty much kind of like the European Union is today.
[00:04:41.423 --> 00:04:45.726]  And so you had Vincente Fox speaking publicly, you know, advocating the North American Union.
[00:04:45.766 --> 00:04:51.531]  The White House even had to tell him to shut up because they didn't want it to be leaked so publicly at that time.
[00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:58.016]  So you have Vincente Fox, of course, now he's flipping Donald Trump off and going out against Trump's wall.
[00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:04.664]  But here's the thing, the globalists, they love open borders because they can use it to manufacture crises.
[00:05:05.165 --> 00:05:10.812]  For example, you saw in Turkey last year they were shipping arms for ISIS into Syria.
[00:05:11.213 --> 00:05:13.415]  That's because Syria had no control over its border.
[00:05:14.036 --> 00:05:18.020]  So, of course, it's easy for Turkey to just go into the country and ship whatever arms they want.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:25.867]  So that allows them to create these manufactured crises to expand the size and scope of the government and to fuel exploitable hysteria.
[00:05:26.347 --> 00:05:32.392]  So, of course, the globalists and, you know, from a libertarian standpoint, open borders are good, but, you know, you kind of have to have the U.S.
[00:05:32.413 --> 00:05:37.917]  and Mexico, you know, kind of like libertarian communities, countries, if you will.
[00:05:38.718 --> 00:05:45.421]  So, you know, it's like, you can't really have open borders when you have a global elite that's exploiting that to expand government.
[00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:51.444]  Now I'm going to have a video report on why the globalists hate Trump's wall on Resistance News on YouTube, so check it out.
[00:05:51.786 --> 00:05:52.286]  Thank you, Kit.
[00:05:52.927 --> 00:05:59.552]  And it'll be really interesting to see just what sort of shared ideas and principles those two have in common.
[00:05:59.973 --> 00:06:04.876]  Now, if you're curious about this, infighting and, of course, the gridlock, well, it's nothing new.
[00:06:04.977 --> 00:06:06.578]  And in fact, it's the name of the game.
[00:06:07.118 --> 00:06:11.021]  And now an anonymous congressman is writing a tell-all book.
[00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:12.603]  This is going to be coming out in a couple of weeks.
[00:06:13.223 --> 00:06:16.666]  But he says these are the confessions of the congressman.
[00:06:16.686 --> 00:06:18.787]  This is what's really going on behind closed doors.
[00:06:19.488 --> 00:06:19.648]  They're
[00:06:40.453 --> 00:06:55.758]  The way that they feel about it is that voters are incredibly ignorant, they know little about our form of government and how it works, and it's far easier than you think to manipulate a nation of naive, self-absorbed sheep who crave instant gratification.
[00:06:56.258 --> 00:07:07.866]  Now, the author is remaining anonymous, but he is a Democrat in Congress who laid out his complaints to a longtime friend and former Capitol Hill staffer who then has edited these into a book.
[00:07:07.906 --> 00:07:15.792]  So if you want to kind of peel back the curtain even more and see how your elected officials are representing you and what they really think about you when they're
[00:07:16.192 --> 00:07:25.754]  Feeding you all of this bull year after year, cycle after cycle, and then just shaking hands and making promises that they know that they don't intend to follow through.
[00:07:26.494 --> 00:07:40.176]  One of the quotes out of the book is, voters claim they want substance and detailed position papers, but what they really crave are cutesy cat videos, celebrity gossip, top 10 lists, reality TV shows, tabloid tripe, and on and on.
[00:07:40.676 --> 00:07:44.777]  And so this is, you know, this is how they really feel, but frankly,
[00:07:45.217 --> 00:07:53.281]  This is what they feed people and of course people want to watch their cute cat videos because it gets them out of their abysmal lives that they are living.
[00:07:53.782 --> 00:07:56.643]  But this is what the entertainment industry does.
[00:07:57.283 --> 00:08:06.648]  We recently just had a really epic interview with Billy Corgan and he was dropping a lot of knowledge and that's what we want to bring to you is a lot of truth and information.
[00:08:07.209 --> 00:08:07.889]  What happens?
[00:08:07.929 --> 00:08:13.192]  You put out this solid information that's going to actually educate the voters out there and immediately
[00:08:13.892 --> 00:08:20.077]  Your establishment media outlets and other places set about to tear down that information.
[00:08:20.578 --> 00:08:31.887]  The issue with this, the Billy Corgan interview became the top trending story on Facebook today and really the issue is that these media outlets had such a hard time
[00:08:32.948 --> 00:08:33.689]  Ripping it apart!
[00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:37.031]  They couldn't even find their angle with it because it was just so good.
[00:08:37.471 --> 00:08:46.597]  And that's the thing that's just really upsetting, is that they couldn't allow people to watch this video and say, wow, you know, that was, he was dropping a lot of knowledge.
[00:08:46.617 --> 00:08:51.280]  And it is time for us to have a real conversation about what's happening in this country.
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.842]  And it is very important that free speech is under attack.
[00:08:54.922 --> 00:08:55.503]  And you know what?
[00:08:55.563 --> 00:08:56.864]  Perhaps these Bernie supporters
[00:08:57.324 --> 00:08:57.784]  Do you think?
[00:09:15.752 --> 00:09:16.093]  Of course.
[00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:42.039]  The movie that we are actually going to be speaking with the director as well as the producer of Amerigetta and Alex Jones is featured in this movie as well.
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.401]  This movie is total truth.
[00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:58.969]  If you really think you can handle it, this movie puts it in your face and this is something, it deals with something that our congressmen who are too busy trying to get re-elected, they don't even look at the bills and they're clearly not even concerned about
[00:09:59.469 --> 00:10:15.981]  One of the major things that is facing this country, one of the most devastating things that we are absolutely not prepared for, is if the grid goes down, if there is an EMP attack that could perhaps take down the grid and fully wreck this country.
[00:10:16.382 --> 00:10:27.690]  Now, the executive producer and the director joined Alex on the Alex Jones Show today to talk about their movie, Amerigeddon, and also breaking down the fact that there are nefarious actors within our government
[00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:34.894]  Who not only know that we really need to be concerned about the grid going down, but in fact, some of them don't even care.
[00:10:36.195 --> 00:10:37.155]  And why did we do it?
[00:10:37.195 --> 00:10:44.240]  Well, we wanted to warn people, but the other thing, and you brought this up, is that there is a criminal elite in Washington, D.C.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.821]  who are bought and paid for.
[00:10:47.562 --> 00:10:49.403]  These people are controlling our country.
[00:10:49.763 --> 00:10:52.104]  You can call it the shadow government, the deep state.
[00:10:52.164 --> 00:10:56.087]  And Americans know that, and they're ready to hear it, but no one will reflect their views.
[00:10:56.107 --> 00:10:56.307]  Sorry.
[00:10:56.767 --> 00:10:59.389]  Well, the Donald Trump movement is what this is about.
[00:10:59.629 --> 00:11:00.470]  We're going to skip this break.
[00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.950]  I'm sorry.
[00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.711]  I'm interrupting too much.
[00:11:03.031 --> 00:11:08.895]  The American people have realized, they've awakened that our country has been stolen.
[00:11:09.376 --> 00:11:15.600]  And here's Donald Trump raising up and saying, I'm going to lead the move to take our country back.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.381]  That's why Donald Trump is resonating.
[00:11:17.381 --> 00:11:22.863]  There's all these populist waves coming in, and sure, you've been a patriot for 30-40 years, you've been brought up one.
[00:11:23.203 --> 00:11:30.345]  We're kind of old-timers at this, but isn't it exciting to see our ideas, our understanding being validated and proven?
[00:11:30.505 --> 00:11:32.305]  Fluoride really is bad for your brain.
[00:11:32.565 --> 00:11:33.966]  Hey, there really is a world government.
[00:11:34.946 --> 00:11:36.367]  You know, there really is an Illuminati.
[00:11:36.847 --> 00:11:39.770]  Hey, they really are establishing Sharia law in areas of Europe.
[00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:47.715]  Everything we've warned people about, global governance, the attack on the family, 9-11 and our government working with the Saudis, it's all coming out?
[00:11:48.096 --> 00:11:48.736]  It's amazing.
[00:11:48.776 --> 00:11:50.257]  Please continue, I'm ranting.
[00:11:50.277 --> 00:11:51.418]  It's just the points you make are so good.
[00:11:51.838 --> 00:11:53.740]  And I'm tempted to, too, because I'm so excited.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:54.040]  Do it!
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:54.420]  Do it!
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:54.821]  Go wild!
[00:11:55.861 --> 00:11:57.042]  I'm so excited about this.
[00:11:57.062 --> 00:12:01.424]  You know, you missed vaccines, and you missed military-industrial conflict.
[00:12:01.444 --> 00:12:03.105]  I mean, everything.
[00:12:03.605 --> 00:12:07.767]  The corporatists have bought and paid for this country.
[00:12:08.068 --> 00:12:12.090]  You know, this Trans-Pacific Partnership, and that was part of how I outed Cruz.
[00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:23.716]  Any of our politicians, and many of them, and I'm a big former Republican donor, the Republicans signed into the law the fast-tracking of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:12:24.316 --> 00:12:33.145]  What you need to know about that is, number one, is any of our politicians that thought the TPP was a good idea are traitors to this country.
[00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:44.216]  That law, or that trade agreement, takes away the sovereignty of nations and states and gives it over to a tribunal of corporate attorneys.
[00:12:45.237 --> 00:12:52.225]  All they have to do is determine that a corporation has been harmed financially from the act of... We got proven right about corporate world government!
[00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:52.826]  Here it is!
[00:12:52.886 --> 00:12:54.248]  And now you call it global government!
[00:12:54.428 --> 00:12:55.810]  And the Pope calls it world government!
[00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.011]  What do you think's happening?
[00:12:57.031 --> 00:12:59.454]  I mean, a hundred years from now, what will they call this time in history?
[00:13:00.115 --> 00:13:02.317]  Well, they're either going to call it the Great Awakening...
[00:13:03.146 --> 00:13:04.206]  Or the Great Disaster.
[00:13:04.646 --> 00:13:07.447]  You know, I am deftly afraid that they're going to kill Trump.
[00:13:08.007 --> 00:13:20.509]  Trump is such a threat to the power and the wealth of these people that are owned by the elitist that I don't know how... You know, you're familiar with MKUltra Mind Control.
[00:13:20.529 --> 00:13:20.889]  Sure.
[00:13:21.049 --> 00:13:25.150]  I'm terrified they're going to have one of these guys come in and knock him out.
[00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.790]  And Mike and I were talking about this today.
[00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.311]  Will the American people really rise up and take their country back?
[00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:32.472]  I don't know.
[00:13:32.492 --> 00:13:36.157]  You know, you cut the head off of something, it usually dies.
[00:13:36.617 --> 00:13:37.559]  And I think they know that.
[00:13:37.779 --> 00:13:42.766]  And if they'll kill a sitting president, John F. Kennedy, what will they do to simply... I agree.
[00:13:44.252 --> 00:13:48.134]  Imagine, that was just a few minutes of a very powerful interview with Alex Jones.
[00:13:48.254 --> 00:13:52.055]  These two worked for about two years on the movie, Amerigeddon.
[00:13:52.375 --> 00:13:54.476]  So you're going to get all sorts of information in there.
[00:13:54.516 --> 00:13:57.657]  That's opening in theaters across the nation today.
[00:13:57.817 --> 00:13:59.198]  Tonight, actually, at midnight.
[00:13:59.578 --> 00:14:01.259]  So be sure and buy your ticket.
[00:14:01.359 --> 00:14:05.941]  Everybody needs to go out there and let Hollywood know that this is the kind of content that we want on our screens.
[00:14:06.301 --> 00:14:08.702]  And yes, indeed, we can handle the truth.
[00:14:09.102 --> 00:14:17.667]  My very powerful interview is coming up with those two next, and then Joe Biggs will be interviewing two former Navy SEALs punished for trying to exercise their rights.
[00:14:22.813 --> 00:14:37.098]  Community organizing, Supreme Commander President Barack Obama hates America so much that even as a lame duck president, he intends on taking one last cheap shot at the success of the American Dream.
[00:14:37.398 --> 00:14:46.661]  Obama and Julian Castro, Obama's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in some kind of ongoing, lightly reported, bizarre Social Agenda 21 experiment,
[00:14:48.001 --> 00:14:53.885]  AIMED TO PUNISH THE SUBURBS OF AMERICA FOR ALL OF THE HARD WORK THAT FUELED THEIR POSITION IN LIFE.
[00:14:54.285 --> 00:14:56.007]  Ours is a nation like no other.
[00:14:56.527 --> 00:15:00.009]  A place where great journeys can be made in a single generation.
[00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:05.113]  No matter who you are or where you come from, the path is always forward.
[00:15:05.453 --> 00:15:18.199]  The New York Post writes, Hillary's rumored running mate, Housing Secretary Julian Castro, is cooking up a scheme to reallocate funding for Section 8 housing to punish suburbs for being too white and too wealthy.
[00:15:18.439 --> 00:15:33.886]  The scheme involves supersizing vouchers to help urban poor afford higher rents in pricey areas such as Westchester County, while assigning them government real estate agents called mobility counselors to secure housing in the exurbs.
[00:15:34.286 --> 00:15:50.170]  Julian Castro, who the left is seeing as their Obama 2.0 and Hillary's VP, was handpicked by the Obama administration in 2014 from his position as mayor of San Antonio, Texas, to oversee Obama's social experimentation on the housing of America.
[00:15:50.351 --> 00:16:02.474]  Castro was highly criticized for the sale of thousands of foreclosed homes to Wall Street firms at bargain basement prices using HUD's Distressed Assets Stabilization Program.
[00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:05.855]  Ninety-eight percent of those homes were sold to Wall Street.
[00:16:06.055 --> 00:16:22.399]  Castro had been brought in to assist Obama's 2013 forced diversity HUD ruling, where Agenda 21 would receive a tremendous steroid shot, resulting in, as Stanley Kurtz, author of Spreading the Wealth, How Obama is Robbing the Suburbs to Pay for the City's Rights,
[00:16:22.699 --> 00:16:26.302]  The new HUD rule is really about changing the way Americans live.
[00:16:26.482 --> 00:16:34.868]  It is part of a broader suite of initiatives designed to block suburban development, press Americans into hyper-dense cities, and force us out of our cars.
[00:16:35.368 --> 00:16:44.015]  Government-mandated ethnic and racial diversification plays a role in this scheme, yet the broader goal is forced economic integration.
[00:16:44.255 --> 00:16:54.900]  The ultimate vision is to make all neighborhoods more or less alike, turning traditional cities into ultra-dense Manhattans, while making suburbs look more like cities do now.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:17:07.906]  In this centrally planned utopia, steadily increasing numbers will live cheek-by-jowl and stack-and-pack high-rises close to public transportation, while automobiles fall into relative disuse.
[00:17:08.207 --> 00:17:09.087]  The Hill reports,
[00:17:09.327 --> 00:17:11.067]  In June 2015, the U.S.
[00:17:11.107 --> 00:17:27.430]  Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that federal housing laws allows people to challenge zoning laws and other housing practices that have a disparate or harmful impact on minority groups, even if there is no proof that the discrimination was intentional.
[00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:37.732]  And two weeks after that Supreme Court ruling, HUD issued a regulation intended to help poor people move into communities that are rich with opportunity, as HUD Secretary
[00:17:38.012 --> 00:17:38.392]  I think so.
[00:18:00.532 --> 00:18:08.498]  Castro threatened to sue suburban landlords for discrimination if they refuse Section 8 tenants with criminal records.
[00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:13.662]  What do you think about considering Julian Castro as Vice President?
[00:18:14.522 --> 00:18:20.325]  Well, I think really highly of him, and I am thrilled to have his endorsement today.
[00:18:20.805 --> 00:18:27.168]  Both he and his brother, the congressman, are just among the best young leaders in America.
[00:18:27.348 --> 00:18:32.710]  Castro's sucking up to Wall Street was seen as a potential toxic addition to Hillary's campaign.
[00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:50.923]  But now, with this dangerous scheme to once again bring government-leeching welfare recipients and criminals in the left-wing perception of two white, white-flight, quiet suburbs of America in the name of fighting inequality, has the potential of placing the American dream squarely over the toilet.
[00:18:51.084 --> 00:18:53.085]  John Bound for InfoWars.com.
[00:19:04.906 --> 00:19:09.309]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.091]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.773 --> 00:19:15.774]  And to look at that threat we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.435 --> 00:19:27.183]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type 1 civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.854 --> 00:19:39.220]  You could say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:50.126]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.

[00:23:03.004 --> 00:23:05.605]  The reason I'm here today is to encourage the U.S.
[00:23:05.665 --> 00:23:10.327]  Congress to take action to protect our country from its most imminent threat.
[00:23:10.787 --> 00:23:14.929]  The smokescreen of national security used by government at every level.
[00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:18.831]  A strong America is the only thing standing in the way.
[00:23:19.051 --> 00:23:20.652]  The country only needs a little chaos.
[00:23:22.773 --> 00:23:24.173]  Hello, Mr. President.
[00:23:24.714 --> 00:23:26.074]  Now is the time.
[00:23:27.195 --> 00:23:29.796]  The average American family only has three days of food.
[00:23:30.336 --> 00:23:31.657]  We need to talk face-to-face.
[00:23:31.677 --> 00:23:32.877]  This is important.
[00:23:33.557 --> 00:23:34.297]  Sir, what's the mission?
[00:23:34.437 --> 00:23:36.798]  Disarm the population and restore order.
[00:23:36.818 --> 00:23:40.279]  Do you have any weapons inside your home on you personally?
[00:23:40.299 --> 00:23:46.181]  You had to give the President power to arrest any American by simply accusing them of terrorism.
[00:23:46.822 --> 00:23:49.383]  The vanity of nationalism will quickly fade.
[00:23:49.703 --> 00:23:52.844]  These are but the birth pangs of a new world order.
[00:23:53.945 --> 00:23:57.189]  I'm just so afraid of the world that you're gonna have to grow up.
[00:23:57.249 --> 00:24:02.315]  This is a time, man, woman, young or old, when folks run and hide.
[00:24:03.196 --> 00:24:04.738]  Or they pull up their bootstraps.
[00:24:08.507 --> 00:24:16.133]  And you were just watching an excerpt from the movie Amerageddon, and I'm here now with the director and the producer, Mike Norris and Gary Haven.
[00:24:16.513 --> 00:24:17.954]  Thank you guys so much for being here today.
[00:24:17.994 --> 00:24:21.177]  You had just an explosive interview on the Alex Jones Show today.
[00:24:21.217 --> 00:24:23.679]  That one's definitely going to be on repeat.
[00:24:23.899 --> 00:24:31.605]  And you mentioned sort of just the climate of the country and how this was a passion project for you and that you just had to get this film made.
[00:24:31.865 --> 00:24:32.766]  So talk to me a little bit.
[00:24:32.786 --> 00:24:35.588]  I mean, it couldn't be more perfect timing for this movie to come out.
[00:24:36.493 --> 00:24:40.658]  Well, you know, it was my idea to create a movie with a message.
[00:24:41.379 --> 00:24:42.360]  Something that was important.
[00:24:43.209 --> 00:24:46.890]  And of course, Mike is a very successful filmmaker.
[00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.651]  His dad is Chuck Norris.
[00:24:50.371 --> 00:24:52.191]  So he spent his lifetime in this business.
[00:24:52.231 --> 00:24:53.532]  We've been friends for many years.
[00:24:54.072 --> 00:24:56.732]  So we've been looking for a project that we could collaborate on.
[00:24:57.493 --> 00:25:00.093]  And we actually made another movie, Mission Air.
[00:25:00.433 --> 00:25:01.674]  It's on Netflix.
[00:25:01.834 --> 00:25:06.475]  It was a small movie that taught us that we could put up with each other.
[00:25:07.654 --> 00:25:22.791]  And when I came to him with this project, Amerigeddon, it was an important project because there is a threat to this country that according to two congressional reports is the most imminent way that America is going to be attacked.
[00:25:23.552 --> 00:25:25.835]  And it's through an electromagnetic pulse.
[00:25:27.111 --> 00:25:39.448]  It just so happened, you know, we started writing the script two years ago, but in the news over the last four or five months, North Korea has launched a second satellite on February the 7th.
[00:25:40.413 --> 00:25:47.682]  North Korea has been miniaturizing nuclear devices that would be perfect to go on top of a satellite.
[00:25:49.043 --> 00:25:54.730]  And they have been, Kim Jong-un has been threatening to destroy America almost on a weekly basis, right?
[00:25:55.251 --> 00:25:56.873]  So you put these three things together.
[00:25:57.393 --> 00:26:03.058]  And you realize that this satellite that crosses America twice a day could destroy this country.
[00:26:03.559 --> 00:26:13.308]  The Congress of the United States says that if they detonate a nuclear device over our country that 90% of the American population would be dead in 12 months.
[00:26:14.008 --> 00:26:17.311]  So Mike and I agreed that this project was important.
[00:26:18.272 --> 00:26:23.657]  And Mike came on board and worked his magic and has created a great movie.
[00:26:24.301 --> 00:26:32.203]  Well, you know, I appreciate that, but it was very clear to me very early on the importance of this film.
[00:26:32.584 --> 00:26:38.345]  You know, it's one thing about being a filmmaker and going out and making a movie.
[00:26:38.625 --> 00:26:40.146]  It's a whole other thing when you're
[00:26:41.198 --> 00:26:47.681]  Getting ready and you're making a project that you know could actually save somebody's life.
[00:26:48.381 --> 00:27:01.588]  If somebody watches this movie, understands the movie, even if they don't understand the whole principle of it, but if they watch the film, within the context of this film is information that could save somebody's life.
[00:27:02.048 --> 00:27:03.809]  And that's why I am just...
[00:27:04.629 --> 00:27:20.455]  Gary's passion has now turned into my obsession, in a way, to gain the knowledge necessary for me to be prepared like I should be and for me to be able to get the knowledge to now go out and tell the world about what's going on.
[00:27:20.575 --> 00:27:23.516]  So, you know, I was behind the curve a little bit when we started.
[00:27:23.856 --> 00:27:30.779]  I understood Gary and I've been in a number of great conversations with him where I'm trying to soak in this knowledge.
[00:27:30.839 --> 00:27:32.840]  It's like with Gary and Alex and you.
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.560]  These people with great knowledge.
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.941]  I'm new to it, but I understood very early on the importance of it.
[00:27:39.361 --> 00:27:43.762]  And I'm just so amazed at the response we're getting now.
[00:27:45.242 --> 00:27:54.524]  You know, you can just feel the groundswell coming when, you know, we're getting ten theaters added in three days and many more calls to expand on this film.
[00:27:54.644 --> 00:27:57.705]  So, you know, I just really like to encourage
[00:27:59.205 --> 00:28:02.407]  Encourage your listeners to come out and support this film.
[00:28:02.427 --> 00:28:03.888]  It is a call to action.
[00:28:04.008 --> 00:28:05.889]  It's, you know, let your voice be heard.
[00:28:05.949 --> 00:28:06.709]  We are a minority.
[00:28:06.969 --> 00:28:08.990]  You know, I don't even want to say we're a minority.
[00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:14.833]  I think a lot of people firmly believe deep down inside what's really going on, but they're afraid to say anything.
[00:28:14.893 --> 00:28:15.193]  They are.
[00:28:15.233 --> 00:28:15.834]  Like I was.
[00:28:15.874 --> 00:28:19.596]  I was afraid to really speak my voice on this, but now I'm in.
[00:28:20.556 --> 00:28:21.717]  I'm in all the way.
[00:28:21.957 --> 00:28:23.878]  And this is now my life.
[00:28:24.571 --> 00:28:25.912]  Yeah, and it's so exciting.
[00:28:26.152 --> 00:28:31.275]  And you mentioned just the explosion now with other theaters saying, hey, we want to get this movie there.
[00:28:31.956 --> 00:28:34.818]  Actually opening it up to premiere at midnight tonight.
[00:28:35.638 --> 00:28:43.063]  And so talk to me a little bit about that, because you experienced some pushback in Hollywood trying to get this movie produced.
[00:28:43.163 --> 00:28:50.108]  And we always sort of see this kind of pushback whenever there's a film like this that can actually save people's lives.
[00:28:50.188 --> 00:28:53.110]  Yeah, you know, we didn't have pushback while we were filming.
[00:28:53.190 --> 00:29:06.861]  I mean, we had a little bit during the casting process where certain actors were going, you know, this isn't something our clientele would be interested in as far as their actors within William Moore, CAA, whoever it may have been.
[00:29:07.402 --> 00:29:15.608]  But once the film was, once we were done with the film, we had it put together, it was like, now what do we do with this film?
[00:29:15.969 --> 00:29:18.671]  And we'd shown it to a number of people in Hollywood that go,
[00:29:20.356 --> 00:29:26.440]  Okay, this is a good movie, but whoa, whoa, there's no way we could get this through our system.
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:33.685]  And we had pushback on just about every step of the process, and it was really until Gary said, you know what?
[00:29:34.045 --> 00:29:35.687]  If they're not going to do it, I'll do it.
[00:29:36.027 --> 00:29:38.769]  And he's the one that stepped up to the plate and really
[00:29:40.089 --> 00:29:45.130]  He really created his own distribution company to put the movie out into theaters.
[00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:46.931]  So it is no easy task.
[00:29:46.991 --> 00:29:51.652]  And I learned firsthand the politics involved in the film industry.
[00:29:51.672 --> 00:29:51.792]  Right.
[00:29:51.912 --> 00:29:53.892]  You know, we just make movies, they go out.
[00:29:54.233 --> 00:30:02.134]  But on this project, there was so much pushback giving us an R rating, which we got turned into a PG-13 after we said, this is ridiculous.
[00:30:02.174 --> 00:30:04.355]  There is nothing in here that gives us an R rating.
[00:30:04.635 --> 00:30:05.315]  And we fought it.
[00:30:05.555 --> 00:30:06.816]  And we have fought the system.
[00:30:07.256 --> 00:30:08.416]  And so we're winning now.
[00:30:08.636 --> 00:30:10.057]  Now we're winning the system.
[00:30:10.117 --> 00:30:15.218]  Now that the people are gravitating towards America in the movie, they're coming to us now.
[00:30:15.298 --> 00:30:18.319]  So I'm just very, very thankful about that.
[00:30:18.639 --> 00:30:23.961]  And I'm thankful to Gary for being bold enough, not only with his mind, but his resources to do this.
[00:30:24.141 --> 00:30:24.881]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:30:24.921 --> 00:30:26.482]  I mean, what did you think about that?
[00:30:26.502 --> 00:30:52.089]  Because, I mean, they're going to make Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 4 or some other ridiculous movie, but then when you have an amazing movie like this come out that's really going to help people and explain what's going on, and given that push that they might need to see beyond the veil of mainstream media or whatever the lies they're being told to kind of placate society, why do you think there is such a pushback with powerful movies like this, but then they can put out trash every week?
[00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:55.812]  There's a couple of factors here.
[00:30:56.072 --> 00:31:00.997]  One is that when I retired a few years ago, I wanted to do something that really made a difference.
[00:31:01.037 --> 00:31:02.598]  I've got a ministry in Haiti.
[00:31:02.958 --> 00:31:06.001]  We feed 10,000 children a day and we have an orphanage in India.
[00:31:06.041 --> 00:31:06.742]  Those things are neat.
[00:31:07.302 --> 00:31:07.983]  It was a pilot.
[00:31:08.023 --> 00:31:14.729]  I flew Rand Paul to Haiti and we did 200 cataract surgeries and blind people would see the next day.
[00:31:14.749 --> 00:31:16.310]  That's pretty cool stuff.
[00:31:17.492 --> 00:31:20.135]  But I realize that you can teach people if you can entertain them.
[00:31:21.317 --> 00:31:22.559]  But I didn't just want to entertain them.
[00:31:22.579 --> 00:31:24.802]  I wanted to make movies that made a difference.
[00:31:25.523 --> 00:31:29.288]  And so Hollywood is opposed to anything that's values-based.
[00:31:29.609 --> 00:31:31.812]  Anything that's got that Judeo-Christian value to it.
[00:31:32.192 --> 00:31:34.095]  You know, telling people the truth, for example.
[00:31:34.875 --> 00:31:47.380]  Well, truth in Los Angeles is considered relevant, and absolute truth is something that anything that's based on that.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:55.023]  And we were telling the truth about not only this threat to America, but perhaps more importantly, we were telling the truth about the criminal cabal
[00:31:55.703 --> 00:31:57.285]  That owns Washington.
[00:31:57.925 --> 00:32:06.134]  I've been a big Republican donor, and I'm going to tell you that I am disgusted with the Republican Party.
[00:32:06.274 --> 00:32:14.322]  They call them the establishment, but the truth of the matter is, our Republican representatives from here in Texas that are supposed to be conservative,
[00:32:16.384 --> 00:32:19.426]  They vote for things like the Trans-Pacific Partnership or the D.A.R.K.
[00:32:19.586 --> 00:32:21.868]  Act, where we're not supposed to know what we're eating.
[00:32:22.488 --> 00:32:25.791]  And so I am going out and calling names.
[00:32:25.851 --> 00:32:30.994]  I'm calling out these Republicans who keep getting elected as if they were constitutionalists.
[00:32:31.535 --> 00:32:33.536]  And this movie has become a platform for that.
[00:32:33.937 --> 00:32:42.863]  And of course, Washington, Los Angeles doesn't want to hear about truth because they maintain power by keeping us in the dark.
[00:32:43.183 --> 00:32:49.367]  Absolutely, and that's why this film is so exciting and everybody has got to go out, watch it, request it in your theaters.
[00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:53.430]  Now when we come back I want to talk to you a little bit about this EMP.
[00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:59.093]  Now I know you spoke with someone in Homeland Security that actually let you know just how safe or not we really are.
[00:32:59.113 --> 00:33:04.757]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important
[00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:06.546]  I think?
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:04.744 --> 00:37:05.444]  And welcome back.
[00:37:05.544 --> 00:37:13.047]  I'm speaking with the director and producer of Amerageddon the movie that's at amerageddonthemovie.com, Mike Norris and Gary Haven.
[00:37:13.067 --> 00:37:13.787]  Thank you so far.
[00:37:13.827 --> 00:37:15.367]  It's been a really great interview.
[00:37:15.847 --> 00:37:24.810]  Now, Gary, I know that you spoke with someone in Homeland Security who who's basically in charge of protecting America from an EMP attack.
[00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:30.632]  So based on that conversation, what would you say is the current state of our safety here?
[00:37:31.987 --> 00:37:41.958]  Yesterday, as a matter of fact, I spoke to Dr. Peter Pry, who is the head of EMP Protection for Homeland Security.
[00:37:42.718 --> 00:37:44.180]  A fascinating conversation.
[00:37:45.541 --> 00:37:50.587]  In fact, I'll tell you a little insight on it that you'll find pretty interesting.
[00:37:51.347 --> 00:38:03.572]  You know, I asked him, why is the political process, why are our representatives done nothing to protect us from what Homeland Security says is the most imminent threat?
[00:38:04.292 --> 00:38:06.713]  And he said, well, you know, these people are bureaucrats.
[00:38:06.753 --> 00:38:09.374]  These people are, you know, are not focused on it.
[00:38:10.074 --> 00:38:12.195]  And I said, Dr. Perry, I've got to ask you.
[00:38:12.855 --> 00:38:15.336]  I believe it's more nefarious than that.
[00:38:15.476 --> 00:38:18.517]  There's a group of people that really run our government, the shadow government.
[00:38:19.478 --> 00:38:22.959]  And I really think they have ill intentions for the American people.
[00:38:23.559 --> 00:38:25.720]  And he said, stop.
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:28.641]  And I said, pardon me?
[00:38:28.801 --> 00:38:32.482]  He said, you know Homeland Security is listening to this phone call.
[00:38:33.503 --> 00:38:35.143]  And then he said, by the way, I agree with you.
[00:38:36.524 --> 00:38:38.765]  And that was a fascinating conversation to have.
[00:38:39.105 --> 00:38:39.285]  Wow.
[00:38:40.356 --> 00:38:45.199]  Wow, so he didn't give you any indication as far as any moves they're making?
[00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:55.604]  I mean, I know we're watching just kind of on the sidelines, you see them holding these meetings there in Congress about, hey, you know, what should we do about when drones are actually flying in the sky?
[00:38:55.684 --> 00:39:03.509]  And they're supposed to open up the skies for drones by, you know, 2015, obviously this past year, and they didn't even have anything, any idea as far as
[00:39:04.369 --> 00:39:05.430]  What are the rules?
[00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:06.931]  Can we attach weapons to them?
[00:39:07.032 --> 00:39:07.732]  Is this okay?
[00:39:07.752 --> 00:39:09.534]  Can we use them against American citizens?
[00:39:09.914 --> 00:39:15.199]  And we're seeing how the Department of Justice and these other places are being hacked into on a regular basis.
[00:39:15.679 --> 00:39:18.281]  It doesn't make you feel very secure as an American citizen.
[00:39:19.682 --> 00:39:22.122]  When Homeland Security can't even protect their own computers.
[00:39:22.183 --> 00:39:26.103]  You know, we've all been told, I'm from the government, you know, and I'm here to help you, right?
[00:39:26.363 --> 00:39:26.543]  Yeah.
[00:39:27.324 --> 00:39:28.884]  And I think the American people are waking up.
[00:39:29.624 --> 00:39:31.224]  Our government does not care about us.
[00:39:32.144 --> 00:39:37.686]  Our government cares about, and by our government, I'm talking about our elected representatives in Washington.
[00:39:37.926 --> 00:39:39.346]  They care about keeping their jobs.
[00:39:39.546 --> 00:39:39.706]  Right.
[00:39:40.026 --> 00:39:41.926]  They care about becoming a lobbyist afterwards.
[00:39:41.946 --> 00:39:44.867]  They care about the power that they get in that position.
[00:39:45.467 --> 00:39:46.827]  And it's not just an opinion.
[00:39:48.848 --> 00:39:59.831]  Princeton and Northwestern University did a study and looked at the federal policies over a 20-year period, and they determined that you and I, as voters, have no influence.
[00:39:59.971 --> 00:40:00.352]  Zero.
[00:40:00.912 --> 00:40:04.033]  That every federal policy has been determined by moneyed interest.
[00:40:05.892 --> 00:40:12.517]  Representatives in Washington, on both sides of the aisle, are bought and paid for and have no regard for us.
[00:40:12.577 --> 00:40:13.057]  And you know what?
[00:40:13.157 --> 00:40:19.241]  Our movie is going to tell the story that these people we're sending to Washington are not going to protect you.
[00:40:19.301 --> 00:40:20.522]  They're going to leave us vulnerable.
[00:40:21.082 --> 00:40:26.186]  And I think there's a movement in this country, the same movement that's supporting Trump,
[00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:33.081]  That we realize our country's been stolen, and we see somebody that's going to help us take it back.
[00:40:33.341 --> 00:40:33.541]  Right.
[00:40:33.841 --> 00:40:34.422]  Absolutely.
[00:40:34.462 --> 00:40:41.665]  I mean, we have a story out today about Congressman X, someone anonymously, who's basically saying, this is how it really is in Congress.
[00:40:41.706 --> 00:40:43.246]  We don't care about the American people.
[00:40:43.266 --> 00:40:46.468]  They're so stupid and naive, and it's super easy to control them.
[00:40:46.828 --> 00:40:48.989]  And all we really care about is getting reelected.
[00:40:49.049 --> 00:40:49.850]  So as long as we can
[00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:52.652]  Put on the show for the people and keep our job.
[00:40:52.872 --> 00:40:53.693]  That's what they care about.
[00:40:53.733 --> 00:40:55.955]  And these idiots are selling our country out.
[00:40:56.015 --> 00:41:01.119]  They do not care about the future for their, even their children, let alone our children and grandchildren.
[00:41:01.139 --> 00:41:02.600]  And you know, we're having a great awakening.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.642]  The American people are finally accepting this.
[00:41:05.882 --> 00:41:08.745]  Do you know that two days ago, George H.W.
[00:41:08.785 --> 00:41:13.108]  Bush said that the American people can't handle the truth.
[00:41:14.089 --> 00:41:14.650]  Two days ago.
[00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:16.451]  And said it publicly.
[00:41:17.072 --> 00:41:17.852]  So you know what?
[00:41:18.032 --> 00:41:18.773]  The American people
[00:41:19.926 --> 00:41:21.127]  Have decided, well, you know what?
[00:41:22.068 --> 00:41:23.590]  We'll show you we can handle the Trump.
[00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:33.521]  We'll show you that we can elect people that actually do their jobs instead of you bums who go there and line your pockets.
[00:41:33.921 --> 00:41:34.342]  Exactly.
[00:41:34.362 --> 00:41:38.707]  Well, so what does your movie have to do with the Trump phenomenon in this country?
[00:41:39.735 --> 00:41:42.117]  Well, I believe that it's resonated.
[00:41:42.137 --> 00:41:48.702]  You know, our movie, Amerigeddon, has had over 4 million views of the trailer.
[00:41:50.323 --> 00:41:51.805]  It's just, it's become a movement.
[00:41:51.825 --> 00:41:52.245]  Right.
[00:41:52.505 --> 00:41:54.667]  And I think it's paralleled the Trump movement.
[00:41:55.962 --> 00:42:02.863]  Because people are getting behind Trump because they're seeing someone stand up to the establishment.
[00:42:03.023 --> 00:42:03.963]  And the moneyed interests.
[00:42:04.504 --> 00:42:05.324]  And the moneyed interests.
[00:42:05.964 --> 00:42:10.585]  You know, Trump never misses talking about Hillary without saying the criminal Hillary.
[00:42:10.725 --> 00:42:10.925]  Right.
[00:42:11.225 --> 00:42:12.305]  We've never seen this before.
[00:42:12.325 --> 00:42:14.465]  He doesn't play politics, yeah.
[00:42:14.825 --> 00:42:20.666]  You know, and I think he ought to say the pedophile Bill Clinton.
[00:42:20.786 --> 00:42:21.086]  Yeah.
[00:42:21.366 --> 00:42:23.127]  You know, he's a violent rapist.
[00:42:25.187 --> 00:42:26.368]  This is established.
[00:42:27.868 --> 00:42:34.632]  And so somebody finally has the nerve to speak in public about these criminals in Washington.
[00:42:35.012 --> 00:42:36.893]  The American people are getting excited about it.
[00:42:37.593 --> 00:42:44.996]  And so in our movie where we show that our government is more than neglectful by not protecting us.
[00:42:45.617 --> 00:42:53.040]  You know, Dr. Peter Pryor that I was talking about said that this Korean satellite that flies over our country twice a day ought to be shot down.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.721]  We shouldn't take a risk.
[00:42:55.002 --> 00:42:55.963]  And we don't know what's on it.
[00:42:56.764 --> 00:42:57.345]  We don't care.
[00:42:57.405 --> 00:42:58.306]  We should shoot it down.
[00:42:58.367 --> 00:43:01.271]  Especially when they're continually saying, we're going to attack you.
[00:43:01.811 --> 00:43:06.097]  Yeah, if 90% of Americans could be killed as a result of this, you shoot it down.
[00:43:07.519 --> 00:43:09.482]  There's not a discussion here, but they're not doing it.
[00:43:10.023 --> 00:43:15.548]  So, a lot of us are now believing that it's not in confidence or ineptness.
[00:43:16.569 --> 00:43:17.569]  It may be deliberate.
[00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:23.494]  You know, Henry Kissinger said that the only thing standing away of a new world order is a strong America.
[00:43:24.135 --> 00:43:31.661]  And I believe that the people in power, the true power, the deep state in this country, are creating chaos.
[00:43:32.342 --> 00:43:34.263]  Because out of chaos you get order.
[00:43:34.844 --> 00:43:37.126]  And it's not only spending
[00:43:38.118 --> 00:43:40.740]  Into oblivion that will never be paid back.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:44.382]  It's an open border where we know ISIS is coming across.
[00:43:44.962 --> 00:43:50.866]  It's bringing in unvetted Syrians when the FBI says up to 10% of them may be radicalized.
[00:43:52.647 --> 00:43:53.448]  That's insane!
[00:43:53.468 --> 00:43:58.171]  And any of us that have common sense would say, you know, what are we even discussing this?
[00:43:58.191 --> 00:44:00.332]  You just don't do it if it puts us at risk like that.
[00:44:01.141 --> 00:44:05.805]  And following Kissinger's words, you know, they need to bring us down.
[00:44:06.366 --> 00:44:10.810]  Remember, these people in power, they aren't allegiant to this country.
[00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:15.814]  They're allegiant to their own power on a world government, a world economic system.
[00:44:15.954 --> 00:44:16.235]  Wow.
[00:44:16.875 --> 00:44:17.876]  That's just incredible.
[00:44:17.936 --> 00:44:19.137]  It's giving me the goosebumps.
[00:44:20.018 --> 00:44:21.958]  So, Mike, talk to me a little bit about the cast.
[00:44:22.219 --> 00:44:23.659]  Obviously, we know liberal Hollywood.
[00:44:23.679 --> 00:44:27.220]  Were these people kind of against us going in, or were they transformed?
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:37.162]  Yeah, there were some against us, but we had Diane Ladd, four-time Academy Award nominated Diane Ladd, who just got nominated for Joy this year.
[00:44:37.502 --> 00:44:39.202]  She was all on board from the beginning.
[00:44:39.522 --> 00:44:41.163]  She understood it, and she was all in.
[00:44:43.323 --> 00:44:51.586]  Marshall Teague, who is in Roadhouse Armageddon, he's in Armageddon now, plays our bad lieutenant.
[00:44:52.986 --> 00:45:02.569]  We've got my daughter Greta Norris, who is the only person besides me and my family that is awake, let's say, who's 16 years old.
[00:45:04.549 --> 00:45:07.950]  So that was our main cast, and obviously Gary Haven.
[00:45:10.291 --> 00:45:16.199]  What we really try to do on our films is pull in as much Texas talent as we can.
[00:45:16.499 --> 00:45:24.008]  These are people that understand our values and our beliefs and are sold out and ready to come to work and not complain about anything.
[00:45:24.849 --> 00:45:25.851]  And that's just lovely.
[00:45:26.311 --> 00:45:28.834]  And we're starting to really see that even people in Hollywood
[00:45:29.315 --> 00:45:34.297]  They can see what's going on and they're kind of saying, I don't care if you blacklist me at this point.
[00:45:34.837 --> 00:45:42.680]  I have to start speaking out against what's happening here and the whole liberal bias, the liberal agenda that is destroying the fabric of this country.
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:54.564]  And I agree with your point of view that perhaps there are some nefarious globalist actors at work that would like to see a weak America because that is what's going to stop this globalist movement.
[00:45:55.154 --> 00:45:55.594]  Absolutely.
[00:45:55.634 --> 00:45:57.796]  We're going up against a couple of them this weekend.
[00:45:58.416 --> 00:46:03.880]  A couple of very liberal actors and actresses and directors that are coming out with movies this week.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.482]  We're going to wipe them right off the map.
[00:46:05.782 --> 00:46:06.382]  Absolutely.
[00:46:06.602 --> 00:46:08.724]  And we will be there right along with you.
[00:46:08.784 --> 00:46:17.430]  I know I'm going to be at the Red Carpet event this weekend, but everybody else out there, it's opening up in select theaters tonight at midnight everywhere across the country.
[00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:21.974]  You can find out where it's playing near you at amerigetinthemovie.com.
[00:46:22.954 --> 00:46:32.682]  But we need to show Hollywood and the nefarious globalist actors that are out there trying to take down this country and tear away at the fabric of this country.
[00:46:33.103 --> 00:46:35.384]  Let them know that we're not going to stand for it.
[00:46:35.464 --> 00:46:36.145]  We are awake.
[00:46:36.205 --> 00:46:37.446]  We can handle the truth.
[00:46:37.966 --> 00:46:42.190]  And you can do that by supporting this movie and show your patriotism today.
[00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:43.791]  Guys, thank you so much for being here.
[00:46:43.811 --> 00:46:44.172]  Thank you, Leah.
[00:46:44.212 --> 00:46:46.513]  Thanks for all you guys who are here at InfoWars.
[00:46:46.734 --> 00:46:47.634]  You're great Americans.
[00:46:48.375 --> 00:46:48.755]  Thank you.
[00:46:49.016 --> 00:46:49.356]  Thank you.

[00:47:07.602 --> 00:47:09.783]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.903 --> 00:47:16.706]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:16.946 --> 00:47:20.207]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.408]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.991]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:52.195]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com.

[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:37.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.701]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:48:41.081 --> 00:48:46.583]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:48:47.023 --> 00:48:53.689]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.

[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:07.102]  And welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:49:07.282 --> 00:49:10.664]  I'm Joe Biggs, and today we have a very special guest.
[00:49:11.024 --> 00:49:18.629]  We actually have Carl Higbee, a former Navy SEAL, whose book just came out yesterday, Enemies Foreign and Domestic.
[00:49:18.729 --> 00:49:22.832]  And joining with me in studio is his co-author, Brandon Caro.
[00:49:23.252 --> 00:49:24.153]  Thanks guys for being here.
[00:49:24.373 --> 00:49:25.074]  Hi, thanks for having us.
[00:49:25.934 --> 00:49:29.397]  So, Brandon, you got involved with Carl Howe.
[00:49:29.437 --> 00:49:30.318]  Tell us a little bit about that.
[00:49:30.678 --> 00:49:33.681]  So, we're both from the same town, Greenwich, Connecticut.
[00:49:34.342 --> 00:49:36.584]  We actually both went into the military around the same time, 2004.
[00:49:37.024 --> 00:49:41.548]  And this was years later, I guess it was like 13 or 14, something like that.
[00:49:41.568 --> 00:49:48.654]  And we have a mutual friend, and I was out to dinner with her, and she... I didn't know Carl at the time, but I knew who he was.
[00:49:49.821 --> 00:49:52.863]  And she was like, did you hear what happened to Carl Higby?
[00:49:52.883 --> 00:49:54.064]  And I was like, no, what happened?
[00:49:54.565 --> 00:49:58.007]  And she was like, oh, well, he got, you know, dishonorably discharged.
[00:49:58.027 --> 00:49:58.728]  That's what she said.
[00:49:58.808 --> 00:50:03.971]  Obviously, that's not what happened, but that was her interpretation or her understanding of what happened.
[00:50:05.032 --> 00:50:06.134]  And I was like, for what?
[00:50:06.494 --> 00:50:07.015]  What did he do?
[00:50:07.035 --> 00:50:15.747]  Because I served also, I'm a veteran, and I realized that to have your discharge downgraded is a very, very serious thing.
[00:50:16.568 --> 00:50:17.909]  So I was like, what did he do?
[00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:19.972]  And it usually is about conduct.
[00:50:20.213 --> 00:50:22.335]  You did something wrong, you behaved inappropriately.
[00:50:23.467 --> 00:50:29.530]  And she was like, well, he went on Fox News and he made critical comments about the Obama administration.
[00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:32.051]  And I was like, that's not against the law, you know?
[00:50:32.171 --> 00:50:48.358]  Yeah, but that's what we're seeing, though, here in Obama's America, that you can't be critical, you can't be honest, you can't tell people what's really going on, because it could be offensive, or it could actually pull back the curtain and show what's really going on with our government, with our commander-in-chief, or lack thereof.
[00:50:48.758 --> 00:50:50.179]  So that's what I want to get into, Carl.
[00:50:50.459 --> 00:50:52.720]  What happened to you, and what made you
[00:50:54.341 --> 00:50:55.185]  Say the things you said.
[00:50:55.206 --> 00:50:58.803]  I mean, what did you notice with the Obama administration and your deployments?
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:02.001]  Well, there was two fundamental issues here.
[00:51:02.321 --> 00:51:14.725]  I'll go out and first say that, you know, the Obama administration, the amount of money and resources they spent to try to prosecute me, which they ultimately lost in the long run anyway, would have been much better served to fix the problem rather than try to cover it up.
[00:51:15.085 --> 00:51:22.527]  But what really pushed me to write Enemies Foreign and Domestic was during my second deployment, I had a friend of mine get killed because of rules of engagement.
[00:51:22.567 --> 00:51:28.969]  He was a bomb technician and he was ordered to remove explosive material and it ultimately killed him and it was against his better judgment.
[00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:37.035]  Additionally, myself and my teammates were court-martialed for prisoner abuse after catching the second most wanted man in the world behind Osama bin Laden.
[00:51:37.736 --> 00:51:40.217]  And we brought him back, not a shot fired.
[00:51:40.257 --> 00:51:45.662]  He bit his lip, spit blood on himself, and told our high-ups that he had been abused by us.
[00:51:45.882 --> 00:51:47.803]  And that's the the Butcher of Fallujah, correct?
[00:51:47.823 --> 00:51:48.624]  Yeah, Patently Full.
[00:51:50.165 --> 00:51:50.885]  We're good to go.
[00:52:07.895 --> 00:52:15.937]  And it really pushed me into the political sphere to say, you know, there's some serious technical difficulties with the military, the chain of command, and also up to the White House.
[00:52:15.997 --> 00:52:30.880]  I published my first book, Battle on the Homefront, and Enemies Foreign and Domestic, the second book, is a first-hand account of me taking on the administration single-handedly, and with the help of Guy Rushenthaler, my attorney, who is now a state senator and PA, we were able to defeat them.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:35.961]  They tried to take away my honorable discharge after I was already out of the military, which is
[00:52:36.741 --> 00:52:37.501]  Wow, that's crazy.
[00:52:37.621 --> 00:52:39.062]  Yeah, I mean, it's completely illegal.
[00:52:39.442 --> 00:52:50.126]  We took them on, we beat them in a 5-0 appellate court decision in my favor, reissuing my honorable discharge and making sure that we had all the good marks back in my record.
[00:52:50.146 --> 00:52:57.910]  So this book is a true account of how to take on the thing, right versus might, the little guy, David N. Goliath, coming through.
[00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:04.012]  And it's a message to people out there and it's a message to the administration that we will not sit silently as a populace.
[00:53:04.315 --> 00:53:10.677]  I mean, I'm so fascinated by all this because I was in the Army, I was in the 82nd Airborne, and I saw corruption at the lower levels.
[00:53:10.697 --> 00:53:14.758]  You know, I was asked to do things that were, you know, went against my better judgment.
[00:53:14.778 --> 00:53:16.919]  A lot of times I was like, you know what, I'm not going to be a part of this.
[00:53:17.279 --> 00:53:23.261]  And I was always curious, was this happening at your level, at that special ops?
[00:53:23.321 --> 00:53:30.383]  And it's interesting to see all the stuff coming out now, you know, with Benghazi, 13 Hours, hearing your story about this, how they're trying to change it.
[00:53:30.663 --> 00:53:34.084]  It's amazing how much corruption is going on and how much they are trying to cover up.
[00:53:34.884 --> 00:53:35.524]  It's incredible.
[00:53:35.725 --> 00:53:47.292]  And the funny thing is they are spending more resources, like I said earlier, trying to cover these problems up rather than just saying, oh, you know what, troops, if you're on the outer wall, maybe you should keep your guns loaded because the TTPs wouldn't let us do that.
[00:53:47.913 --> 00:53:51.235]  Maybe you should just kill bad guys rather than try to win their hearts and minds.
[00:53:51.255 --> 00:53:55.217]  I mean, these are fundamental things that even the common person who hasn't served understands.
[00:53:55.338 --> 00:53:57.279]  Why can't the administration get through their heads?
[00:53:57.699 --> 00:53:57.919]  Yeah.
[00:53:58.059 --> 00:54:02.022]  I think when we were working on this book, we started working on it in early 2014.
[00:54:03.403 --> 00:54:05.685]  It was before the big ISIS push.
[00:54:05.905 --> 00:54:07.507]  It was before they took Fallujah.
[00:54:08.547 --> 00:54:21.738]  And in the book we talk about, on Carl's second deployment, how they had intel on high-level guys in the opposition, in al-Qaeda and in other terror networks, that they couldn't get mission approval for.
[00:54:22.298 --> 00:54:27.482]  And now, in all likelihood, those people are members of the ISIS administration.
[00:54:27.902 --> 00:54:31.527]  So you feel that these guys are kind of helping hiding some of these guys to let them flourish?
[00:54:31.848 --> 00:54:35.753]  When we were over there in 2009, we began to pull out and withdraw prematurely.
[00:54:36.474 --> 00:54:44.004]  What happened was is these targets that we were supposed to action that we were over there to get, the Obama administration started ignoring them.
[00:54:44.384 --> 00:54:46.364]  They said, well, there's no more war anymore.
[00:54:46.404 --> 00:54:47.044]  We've won the war.
[00:54:47.064 --> 00:54:48.625]  We're bringing our troops home.
[00:54:48.665 --> 00:54:54.026]  The fact of the matter is the enemy gets a say on whether or not you've won or lost the war, and they were not done yet.
[00:54:54.406 --> 00:55:00.887]  So we just left a job half finished, and a lot of these troops were able to go back, and they are the foundation of ISIS.
[00:55:00.927 --> 00:55:08.428]  They're, you know, Saddam dissidents or previous Saddam army people, and they're the fundamentals of why that region is devolving.
[00:55:08.448 --> 00:55:09.808]  It's because we let them go.
[00:55:09.848 --> 00:55:13.489]  We didn't go get them because the administration was too fairy-handed to want to go get them.
[00:55:14.414 --> 00:55:15.075]  Yes, interesting.
[00:55:15.675 --> 00:55:21.721]  Brandon shared an article with me the other day about some other things you're dealing with as well in your own personal life.
[00:55:22.041 --> 00:55:26.065]  Tell us a little bit more about that as well with regards to guns and all that.
[00:55:26.923 --> 00:55:30.967]  Well, actually, there was an article recently published in the Washington Post, is what you're talking about.
[00:55:31.627 --> 00:55:34.510]  I was separating from my ex-wife.
[00:55:36.332 --> 00:55:37.753]  The fact is, I don't want to demonize her.
[00:55:37.813 --> 00:55:38.934]  She's the mother of my child.
[00:55:38.974 --> 00:55:44.699]  But what she did was, in an emotional feat, was try to ban me from owning firearms around my daughter.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.561]  I have no criminal record.
[00:55:46.581 --> 00:55:47.982]  I'm a poster child for the NRA.
[00:55:48.923 --> 00:56:01.869]  And I fought it tooth and nail, and the fact is it was originally a judge that upheld it and made an emotional, you know, took her emotional plea and said, you know, I don't want him to own guns around the child for the sake of, you know, the better judgment for all.
[00:56:02.509 --> 00:56:03.910]  And we challenged, we won.
[00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:18.196]  Now, the problem here is that when you have somebody who's trained like I am, or even if somebody's not trained like I am, there's no just cause to remove firearm rights under the Second Amendment, Article 1, Section 15 of the Connecticut Constitution, and also local state laws.
[00:56:18.636 --> 00:56:25.062]  I wasn't doing anything wrong and this was a big challenge and I think the Second Amendment is being greatly challenged in the family courts.
[00:56:25.102 --> 00:56:31.328]  It's being used as leverage to over custody for fathers and we fought and we had Rachel Baird.
[00:56:31.388 --> 00:56:33.470]  She's a big-time attorney for the NRA.
[00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:38.554]  We also had a Beverly Krieger who stepped up and really took this case by the horns and said, you know what?
[00:56:39.715 --> 00:56:44.540]  You can't remove someone's right to drive just because they may have had an accident.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:49.944]  You definitely can't remove someone's right to own a firearm simply because it's an emotional plea.
[00:56:50.505 --> 00:56:57.331]  And it's being done across the country, but we need to make sure that this is precedent now because we set the tone that says you can't do this anymore.
[00:56:57.671 --> 00:56:58.191]  Yeah, indeed.
[00:56:58.552 --> 00:57:03.956]  Well, since we're in a political time right now, we have some elections coming up.
[00:57:04.216 --> 00:57:05.337]  There's a lot of different candidates.
[00:57:05.718 --> 00:57:06.839]  Who does Carl Higby like?
[00:57:07.594 --> 00:57:10.675]  Well, Carl Higby, in all fairness, is a Donald Trump national surrogate.
[00:57:11.116 --> 00:57:13.036]  So, I'm obviously a Donald Trump fan.
[00:57:13.056 --> 00:57:14.377]  I think he's the right man for the job.
[00:57:15.458 --> 00:57:16.378]  He doesn't mince words.
[00:57:16.438 --> 00:57:17.238]  He says what he means.
[00:57:17.278 --> 00:57:18.079]  He means what he says.
[00:57:18.119 --> 00:57:20.020]  And I think he'll do the right thing across the board.
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:21.240]  Yeah, I agree.
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:28.884]  I mean, I like having someone like this that's going to come out and not be politically correct and smash through a lot of this stuff, bring a lot of these things to the forefront.
[00:57:29.324 --> 00:57:33.806]  The 28 pages, talking about hopefully prosecuting Hillary Clinton.
[00:57:34.086 --> 00:57:35.166]  She deserves to be in jail.
[00:57:35.186 --> 00:57:36.347]  She's one of the most evil people
[00:57:36.827 --> 00:57:41.654]  I've ever, you know, heard of, seen, that's a public figure.
[00:57:41.694 --> 00:57:50.047]  It's just astounding to see someone like that that's able to run for president and the FBI is looking into her and yet people still will vote for her.
[00:57:50.677 --> 00:57:53.179]  You know, America can survive a Barack Obama.
[00:57:53.199 --> 00:57:56.922]  They can survive a Hillary Clinton or Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders.
[00:57:56.942 --> 00:58:02.767]  But what they cannot survive is an electorate dumb enough to keep electing these people who sell them down the river.
[00:58:03.508 --> 00:58:10.033]  You know, the Democrats have been running on the fact that this is a racist nation for, oh, I don't know, you know, the last 30 or 40 years.
[00:58:10.093 --> 00:58:12.875]  The fact is we are the least racist nation ever.
[00:58:13.276 --> 00:58:15.998]  And if there's anything racist about this country, it's
[00:58:15.998 --> 00:58:25.225]  It's the Democratic Party, the same party that 150-160 years ago traded in a steady stream of housing and food in exchange for labor.
[00:58:25.325 --> 00:58:35.113]  Now, that same Democratic Party trades WIC cards, food stamps, and federal housing, so housing and food, in a steady exchange for votes.
[00:58:35.513 --> 00:58:42.359]  We need to examine and do a history check on which party stands for what, and I think that's what the American populace is forgetting.
[00:58:43.078 --> 00:58:46.001]  Alright, well thank you Carl for joining us, and Brandon as well.
