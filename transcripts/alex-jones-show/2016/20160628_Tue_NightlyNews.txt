[00:00:20.182 --> 00:00:22.105]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:25.851]  It is Tuesday, June 28, 2016 and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:27.013]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:30.728 --> 00:00:34.912]  Tonight, a massive terror attack at airport check-in in Turkey.
[00:00:35.492 --> 00:00:38.355]  Initial reports are 28 dead and over 60 wounded.
[00:00:38.915 --> 00:00:41.838]  Alex Jones reports what happened and analyzes what it means.
[00:00:42.258 --> 00:00:47.122]  Then, we look at the final report from the Congressional Committee investigating Benghazi.
[00:00:47.883 --> 00:00:57.331]  And, Trump declares America's economic independence as he takes on the central issue of the campaign, globalism's destruction of our economy.
[00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:09.921]  If we're going to deliver real change, we're going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation being pursued by powerful corporations, media elites, and political dynasties.
[00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:20.489]  The people who rigged the system for their benefit will do anything and say anything to keep things exactly the way they are.
[00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:23.552]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.432]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com with an extremely important message.
[00:01:55.933 --> 00:02:00.916]  You're probably asking yourself right now, what's the most important phrase in America right now?
[00:02:01.456 --> 00:02:03.658]  Well, it happens to be Hillary for Prison.
[00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:07.420]  Get your Hillary for Prison t-shirt today at the InfoWars store for $9.95.
[00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:10.482]  That's half of what it used to be at $19.95.
[00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:12.904]  Why do you want to get this?
[00:02:12.964 --> 00:02:15.485]  Why should you buy this for you and your friends and family?
[00:02:15.826 --> 00:02:18.968]  Because number one, it's a great conversation starter, and number two,
[00:02:19.648 --> 00:02:24.212]  Hell, you get to trigger a whole lot of crazy liberal commie bastards, and that's what I like to do.
[00:02:24.552 --> 00:02:31.778]  And maybe you're just at work right now, and it's casual shirt Friday, and one of your hipster buddies walks in with a Hillary Clinton shirt saying, I'm with her.
[00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:32.599]  Negative!
[00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:33.360]  This is what you're gonna do.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:42.367]  You're gonna stand up and go, UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:50.447]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get your Hillary for Prison shirt today for $9.95 and trigger more assholes like him.
[00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.270]  Come on, Hillary.
[00:02:53.471 --> 00:02:54.051]  Just a little.
[00:02:54.352 --> 00:02:55.132]  Just a little sip.
[00:02:55.693 --> 00:02:55.993]  Open up.
[00:02:56.314 --> 00:02:57.215]  Come on, take it!
[00:02:57.695 --> 00:02:58.076]  Take it!
[00:03:02.247 --> 00:03:07.431]  Well, another terror attack has taken place in Turkey, this time at the airport in Istanbul.
[00:03:08.151 --> 00:03:11.794]  At least 50 people have been killed, many more wounded.
[00:03:12.174 --> 00:03:15.676]  Two suicide bombings took place there at the airport.
[00:03:15.716 --> 00:03:20.300]  Now, this is one of the largest, the third busiest airports in Europe.
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.521]  It's a very high security location.
[00:03:22.881 --> 00:03:28.025]  So the fact that this could take place there is thoroughly unsettling.
[00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:30.727]  And with more commentary on that is Alex Jones.
[00:03:32.304 --> 00:03:33.625]  It happened again today.
[00:03:33.765 --> 00:03:36.967]  The religion of peace has struck again.
[00:03:38.108 --> 00:03:44.133]  More than 10 dead in a bombing and mass shooting at a major airport in Turkey.
[00:03:45.265 --> 00:03:59.216]  And the mainstream media is reporting on this and not even calling it Islamic terror, because the President-in-Chief, or I should say the Jihadi-in-Chief, has instructed everyone not to call it Islamic terror.
[00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:07.422]  There's a lot of different issues here, but first off, since when does the First Lady tell school children nationwide what they'll eat at lunch or breakfast?
[00:04:08.183 --> 00:04:09.203]  In the school lunch program?
[00:04:09.764 --> 00:04:17.207]  Since when does the president tell the press and the media they can't use the word radical Islam or Islamic terror?
[00:04:18.607 --> 00:04:20.408]  That is so authoritarian.
[00:04:20.828 --> 00:04:23.710]  That is so incredibly cultic.
[00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.193]  And we have record numbers of people from Islamic nations being brought into this nation, unvetted,
[00:04:32.153 --> 00:04:47.838]  And when they attack, whether it be Sam Bernardino or Major Hassan at Fort Hood, Texas, or this terrible event we saw out in Florida at the Gay Nightclub, it's then blamed on gun owners?
[00:04:48.458 --> 00:04:53.079]  Or it's blamed, in the case of Orlando, on Donald Trump?
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.961]  We have seen gay black activists out on the street blaming Donald Trump.
[00:05:00.475 --> 00:05:07.338]  When Donald Trump is on record never being someone who is quote against the gay community.
[00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:13.762]  It is Islam that fundamentally in 11 nations says they will execute anyone who's a homosexual.
[00:05:14.922 --> 00:05:18.784]  And my frustration on this front is I'm a libertarian.
[00:05:19.504 --> 00:05:26.368]  I have my personal views but I don't try to make you follow my lifestyle or my worldview.
[00:05:26.728 --> 00:05:28.289]  I'm truly tolerant.
[00:05:29.397 --> 00:05:32.401]  But the left doesn't want me to just be tolerant.
[00:05:32.882 --> 00:05:41.013]  They want me to adopt all their weird, crazy garbage, like sexualizing children age five, teaching them Heather has two mommies.
[00:05:42.543 --> 00:05:46.125]  I don't want homosexual or heterosexual or anything sexual taught to young children.
[00:05:46.866 --> 00:05:52.030]  And they'll tell me, oh, I'm a homophobe or a bigot because I won't let them get involved in the raising of my children.
[00:05:52.490 --> 00:06:05.459]  And then they go further and say I'm Islamophobic because I point out that orthodox Islam is radical Islam and oppresses women to a level never before seen in history.
[00:06:06.359 --> 00:06:11.543]  And its very system, its very dogma is one of conquest and enslavement.
[00:06:13.359 --> 00:06:17.820]  The African slave trade was started and run by the Arabs.
[00:06:18.701 --> 00:06:28.204]  It's still going on in several Middle Eastern countries today, but I get to watch the black Muslims run around and tell me how great Islam is.
[00:06:30.144 --> 00:06:31.385]  I'm simply here saying this.
[00:06:32.605 --> 00:06:35.246]  The globalists have allied with orthodox Islam.
[00:06:36.417 --> 00:06:38.518]  They are using it to destabilize the world.
[00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:48.484]  And they use that destabilization to impoverish and enslave the West, but also impoverish and enslave the Middle East and areas of Africa that are Islamic.
[00:06:49.204 --> 00:06:51.426]  I know good people that are Muslims.
[00:06:52.226 --> 00:06:54.847]  I know that most Muslims really do want peace.
[00:06:55.768 --> 00:07:04.393]  The problem is you're seen as heretics by the Saudi Arabian leadership that controls modern Sunni Islamic teaching.
[00:07:06.212 --> 00:07:08.213]  And that is the new dominant form of Islam.
[00:07:09.293 --> 00:07:11.594]  So Islam's had different periods in its history.
[00:07:11.974 --> 00:07:14.195]  And I do want to coexist and live in peace.
[00:07:15.015 --> 00:07:25.339]  But coexistence doesn't mean I give up my Christian values, or my libertarian values, or my free market values, or my values to empower and uplift women and everybody else.
[00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:27.760]  I'm proud of the West empowering women.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:33.082]  I'm proud of the West empowering literature and art and culture and creating a complex truly
[00:07:34.269 --> 00:07:37.090]  Independent, open, free, diverse society.
[00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:49.055]  And I'm not going to sit here and watch the West scapegoated and blamed for what the authoritarian left and their Islamic cohorts are now engaging in.
[00:07:49.795 --> 00:07:51.576]  You people are the gang members.
[00:07:51.996 --> 00:07:53.197]  You people are the thugs.
[00:07:53.597 --> 00:07:58.359]  You people are the ones trying to restrict speech and ban speech on the left and in Islam.
[00:07:59.215 --> 00:08:03.037]  The new mayor, the Islamic Mayor of London, has said, we'll just break away.
[00:08:03.237 --> 00:08:04.738]  We'll just ignore the voters.
[00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:06.499]  We'll just bring in more people.
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.281]  We'll just do whatever the EU says.
[00:08:10.002 --> 00:08:13.424]  And by the way, we're going to ban women in bathing suits in advertising.
[00:08:14.404 --> 00:08:16.165]  And he says it's fat shaming.
[00:08:16.205 --> 00:08:17.486]  No, it's Sharia law.
[00:08:19.767 --> 00:08:20.228]  My friends,
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:34.166]  The truth is, the West has been so open, so truly liberal, that a bunch of fascists calling themselves liberals, allied with Islam, are coming in and dominating and taking control of our civilization and our society.
[00:08:34.807 --> 00:08:44.812]  True liberalism means that you can have your own individual ideas and that you're not going to attack other people for their views or their lifestyle as long as they're not physically attacking you.
[00:08:46.513 --> 00:08:48.934]  It's time for there to be a reformation in Islam
[00:08:49.755 --> 00:08:53.356]  And there's time for a reform and reformation in the so-called liberals.
[00:08:54.636 --> 00:09:05.158]  God knows the conservatives need it as well, but you guys are in the catbird seat running the show and you have let the power go to your heads and you are wrecking thousands of years of progress.
[00:09:06.098 --> 00:09:12.259]  Just because you call yourselves progressive doesn't mean you're truly progressive for freedom and liberty and prosperity.
[00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:16.060]  You're progressive for tyranny and that makes you
[00:09:17.486 --> 00:09:19.348]  The establishment left and Islam.
[00:09:20.008 --> 00:09:20.509]  A cancer.
[00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.553]  I'm Alex Jones for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:09:24.973 --> 00:09:28.036]  Now back to our anchors and the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:42.705]  Now considering the fact that we're seeing a ramp up of these ISIS-inspired terror attacks around the world, it's very troubling to know that the FBI hasn't alerted many Americans that they were actually on an ISIS kill list.
[00:09:43.346 --> 00:09:46.488]  Now this was numerous Americans, some 15,000 people,
[00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.970]  We're good to go.
[00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:13.390]  And California.
[00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:30.076]  In Texas alone, Circa identified 22 people in a sampling of 24 names who did not receive any notification that they were on ISIS's list, in ISIS's crosshairs, and it also identified two local police departments whose citizens were on this list.
[00:10:30.136 --> 00:10:32.177]  They also got no alert from the FBI.
[00:10:33.357 --> 00:10:37.402]  Now, maybe you could say, yeah, well, they didn't want to terrify these people or frighten them.
[00:10:37.843 --> 00:10:39.284]  No, but that is ridiculous.
[00:10:39.325 --> 00:10:41.367]  A lot of these people were military families.
[00:10:41.788 --> 00:10:49.177]  You would want to alert them so that they could take the necessary precautions that even with the arming themselves and making sure their families were well prepared.
[00:10:49.617 --> 00:10:57.448]  Making sure they weren't posting anything on social media or making sure that there wasn't any identifying information out there about where they live or where they're hanging out.
[00:10:57.929 --> 00:11:03.056]  Something to prepare these people to let them know that for whatever reason their names are appearing on these lists.
[00:11:03.457 --> 00:11:04.919]  But we're seeing that again and again too.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:24.810]  Uh, sort of steer people away from the thought that terrorism exists, that it's out there, because they want to push this narrative that Obama has just really done a stellar job at stopping the JV team, ISIS is under control, and actually we've seen that same narrative being pushed with the Benghazi attack.
[00:11:25.491 --> 00:11:34.736]  The 800-page file has been released today on this, from the Benghazi Select Committee, and you'll see that as this attack was taking place,
[00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:48.071]  They were already working out how to spin the story, how to take it away from terrorism and to make it save face politically for the Obama administration while endangering Americans.
[00:11:48.351 --> 00:11:49.893]  And they're doing that here again.
[00:11:50.153 --> 00:11:54.899]  So is this who we really want running the country at this critical juncture in our history?
[00:11:55.359 --> 00:11:56.000]  Absolutely not.
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:02.587]  Not someone who would spin away terrorism in order to save face politically while endangering the lives of Americans.
[00:12:03.007 --> 00:12:08.193]  And that's why they just hate Donald Trump, because he's coming out and saying that.
[00:12:08.513 --> 00:12:15.621]  And in fact, he's going on to criticize the TPP, which Hillary Clinton and Obama played a major role in.
[00:12:16.021 --> 00:12:20.465]  He's saying this globalization and free trade are absolutely job killers.
[00:12:20.765 --> 00:12:31.395]  We're going to talk about that coming up, but he points out how globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very, very wealthy, but it hasn't done very much for the rest of America.
[00:12:32.156 --> 00:12:37.404]  Now, Obama came out very snarkily and saying, well, Trump embodies the global elites.
[00:12:37.744 --> 00:12:41.510]  He's hardly a spokesperson for a populist surge.
[00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:46.697]  And on that, you know, of course, he's correct in that Donald Trump is a billionaire.
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:55.264]  You know, Obama, you were once being touted as the first black president, but you're hardly a legitimate spokesperson for that community.
[00:12:55.404 --> 00:12:58.646]  What have you done for the black community since you've been in office?
[00:12:59.146 --> 00:13:05.270]  Even we had an Obama phone lady on to say, no, indeed, you didn't even give her the phone that you promised her.
[00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:12.875]  But this is why the globalists hate Trump, because he did come out and he said, yes, indeed, I became very wealthy here in America.
[00:13:12.915 --> 00:13:14.316]  America made me very rich.
[00:13:14.916 --> 00:13:19.378]  That's why he loves this country, and that's why he wants to make America great again.
[00:13:19.638 --> 00:13:20.819]  And they absolutely hate him.
[00:13:21.119 --> 00:13:33.204]  And indeed, on the economy, this is one of the big issues where Trump really needs to stay focused, because this is where it threatens Hillary Clinton, because we've just been in dire straits with these last two
[00:13:34.184 --> 00:13:38.765]  Presidential runs with Obama and we don't need a Clinton in office.
[00:13:39.186 --> 00:13:49.129]  A new poll that has come out is actually saying that voters feel much more confident by five points that Trump is actually going to be the candidate that would create more jobs.
[00:13:49.749 --> 00:13:56.331]  And indeed, I think people are really starting to see that worldwide as we see with Brexit.
[00:13:56.431 --> 00:14:02.413]  The people there just showed tremendous bravery in choosing the unknown rather than the known
[00:14:02.813 --> 00:14:11.978]  To stick with globalism, they could see what's been happening with their country, how the open borders, the loss of jobs, their economy is tanking, and these people are saying enough is enough.
[00:14:12.078 --> 00:14:15.640]  Globalism, it's a job killer, and they wanted something different.
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:21.303]  Well now because of that, and because of this populist surge that they're seeing with all these people supporting Donald Trump,
[00:14:21.883 --> 00:14:27.947]  We're really seeing the New World Order ramping up their plans to make this happen even quicker.
[00:14:28.007 --> 00:14:33.351]  We've got the EU saying they're going to create a super state in response to all of this.
[00:14:33.711 --> 00:14:38.134]  And now we even have the Mexican president coming out demanding that the U.S.
[00:14:38.274 --> 00:14:40.315]  merge with Mexico and Canada.
[00:14:40.776 --> 00:14:43.357]  They want the North American Union to happen.
[00:14:43.638 --> 00:14:45.319]  Of course, that would kill U.S.
[00:14:45.499 --> 00:14:46.500]  national sovereignty.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.722]  A Donald Trump presidency is not going to allow that happen, at least
[00:14:50.482 --> 00:14:53.545]  Not if we hold him to what he has promised us.
[00:14:54.145 --> 00:14:56.507]  But I don't want that to happen.
[00:14:56.727 --> 00:15:05.334]  You know, I know there are a lot of people that are coming to this country to escape vile, horrific things that are happening in Mexico and Central America.
[00:15:06.581 --> 00:15:08.162]  But look at what's going on.
[00:15:08.182 --> 00:15:10.764]  I mean, they're out of the Cartel Chronicles with Breitbart.
[00:15:10.804 --> 00:15:13.767]  They have really graphic stories all the time.
[00:15:13.807 --> 00:15:14.968]  These people are so brave.
[00:15:15.008 --> 00:15:20.372]  They would be murdered if anyone found out who was actually supplying this information to Breitbart.
[00:15:20.692 --> 00:15:31.961]  But they're being very brave, using pseudonyms to put these articles out there, showing graphic images of these executions that most journalists are afraid to report about because they don't want
[00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:34.442]  First of all, they don't want the cartels coming after them.
[00:15:34.542 --> 00:15:42.404]  But secondly, this would totally kill open immigration and kill the fact that, you know, we do need a border wall.
[00:15:42.724 --> 00:15:52.307]  And actually, our guys were visiting the border and they just so happened to confront some illegal immigrants who were actually crossing the border right at that moment.
[00:15:52.407 --> 00:15:54.207]  A group of more than 20 people.
[00:15:54.867 --> 00:16:00.489]  And you know it's really bad when these border agents are willing to speak out on camera
[00:16:00.809 --> 00:16:03.351]  And just put it all out there so there's no confusion.
[00:16:04.051 --> 00:16:06.833]  Jakari Jackson spoke with the border agent Chris Cabrera.
[00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:11.335]  He's also the vice president of the National Border Patrol Council 3307.
[00:16:11.956 --> 00:16:18.299]  And he was just saying, you know, the vast majority of illegals are released into the country, disease or no disease.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:27.105]  Agents are still encountering tuberculosis, scabies, measles, chickenpox, and many other unidentifiable infectious diseases.
[00:16:27.885 --> 00:16:30.769]  And they have a yellow caution tape that ropes off.
[00:16:30.849 --> 00:16:31.750]  Oh, you're the sick one.
[00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:38.878]  When they do get them in these quarantine facilities, it's a yellow tape that is separating the sick from the not sick people.
[00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:40.260]  So take a listen.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.786]  Border agents own voice here trying to get this very urgent message out to America.
[00:16:46.687 --> 00:16:53.655]  And as far as the people coming over, are your agents encountering any type of infectious diseases, people with illnesses as they cross the border?
[00:16:53.915 --> 00:16:54.636]  Oh, most definitely.
[00:16:54.676 --> 00:16:59.962]  We see tuberculosis pretty regularly, scabies more often than not.
[00:17:00.342 --> 00:17:04.607]  We have large amounts of infectious diseases as far as scabies go.
[00:17:05.208 --> 00:17:07.750]  And the interesting part with that is it's not actually
[00:17:09.756 --> 00:17:10.237]  We're good to go.
[00:17:35.467 --> 00:17:42.697]  And Jokari also asked Agent Cabrera about Trump's proposed border wall, and he said it would indeed be an asset to agents.
[00:17:43.097 --> 00:17:45.100]  You know, it's not going to stop everyone from coming through.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.526]  Indeed, that they would need some electronic surveillance, some other form of detection.
[00:17:49.887 --> 00:17:52.230]  But he said, indeed, a wall would be an asset.
[00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:52.811]  It would help.
[00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:55.955]  So go to InfoWars.com, watch this video.
[00:17:56.115 --> 00:18:01.181]  Border Patrol agent tuberculosis and other diseases are spreading easily.
[00:18:01.582 --> 00:18:03.585]  Share that video with everyone.
[00:18:03.905 --> 00:18:05.006]  Put it out there on Facebook.
[00:18:05.026 --> 00:18:10.494]  People need to see that the border agents are speaking out, that this is a real issue.
[00:18:10.874 --> 00:18:24.400]  And now we have the Obama administration dumping 4,000 more illegal alien kids into the U.S., and this is during the month of April, so that brings the total to 29,250 kids that have just been dumped all throughout the U.S.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:34.064]  And so we can take a look at what's going on in Europe, where Muslim asylum seekers raped a woman, some 22-year-old guys, because they were having a bad day.
[00:18:34.464 --> 00:18:38.506]  So this is what we are importing into our country with no vetting system,
[00:18:38.846 --> 00:18:45.069]  On the one side, you have a presidential candidate who is putting global politics over the safety of you and your family.
[00:18:45.509 --> 00:18:49.091]  And on the other side, well, you got somebody that wants to make America great again.
[00:18:49.451 --> 00:18:52.052]  Now stick around because there's more news coming right up.
[00:19:04.898 --> 00:19:06.339]  There's a very important question.
[00:19:08.168 --> 00:19:09.309]  That needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.091]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.772 --> 00:19:15.754]  And to look at that threat we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.434 --> 00:19:27.183]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type 1 civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.854 --> 00:19:39.220]  You could say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:50.126]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.

[00:23:03.672 --> 00:23:04.513]  And welcome back.
[00:23:04.833 --> 00:23:09.236]  Now, today, the final majority report of the Benghazi Select Committee was released.
[00:23:09.717 --> 00:23:11.218]  It's about 800 pages.
[00:23:11.618 --> 00:23:13.720]  And does it tell us anything new?
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.461]  Joining me now, Margaret Howell.
[00:23:15.662 --> 00:23:16.762]  We're going to break this down.
[00:23:17.143 --> 00:23:24.829]  Now, what we do know is that when this attack was taking place, the White House was already focusing on some spins.
[00:23:25.009 --> 00:23:26.149]  Spin control, Leanne.
[00:23:26.169 --> 00:23:27.110]  That's what I'm calling this.
[00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.090]  You know, I've been looking at this report all morning long.
[00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:30.390]  This is what I found.
[00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.771]  So at 7.30, the White House had a two-hour meeting.
[00:23:32.791 --> 00:23:36.292]  They knew that Ambassador Stevens had in fact been kidnapped at that point.
[00:23:36.612 --> 00:23:37.232]  Here's what they did.
[00:23:37.252 --> 00:23:39.853]  They came up with an action plan, a 10-item action plan.
[00:23:39.993 --> 00:23:45.534]  Five of those actions on this list included a YouTube video that had nothing to do with Benghazi.
[00:23:45.594 --> 00:23:47.715]  So while the kidnapping was underway,
[00:23:48.195 --> 00:23:50.437]  It was all about spin and damage control.
[00:23:50.457 --> 00:24:08.153]  There were two White House operatives, two officials, their names are Ben Rhodes and David Plouffe, if I'm saying that correctly, and they were prepping Susan Rice to go on national talk shows in the wake of this to do damage control instead of stepping out in front of this and doing something.
[00:24:08.473 --> 00:24:08.693]  Right.
[00:24:08.813 --> 00:24:14.400]  And of course, so this is, you know, putting it in context, this was about 50 something days out from the next election.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:21.568]  So it was all about politics, saving face for the Obama administration, not about saving these Americans that were there.
[00:24:22.108 --> 00:24:22.949]  But you're absolutely right.
[00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.670]  Yes.
[00:24:38.945 --> 00:24:50.307]  The number per day, I broke this down, if you want to look at it this way, $8,000 a day this committee spent investigating, or if you wanted to do it per page, roughly $9,056 per page of information.
[00:24:50.347 --> 00:24:51.647]  It's valuable information.
[00:24:52.087 --> 00:24:53.287]  It's worth a read.
[00:24:54.028 --> 00:24:56.848]  Congressman Grouty, am I saying his name right?
[00:24:57.608 --> 00:25:00.069]  He encouraged people to come out and read this report.
[00:25:00.249 --> 00:25:06.750]  800 pages if you can stomach it, but the bottom line is that the blame falls on the administration and on Hillary Clinton.
[00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:07.530]  That's the bottom line.
[00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:08.871]  I can give you the cliff notes.
[00:25:09.371 --> 00:25:09.491]  Right.
[00:25:09.511 --> 00:25:18.078]  Well, I mean, immediately before people even had a chance to digest this report, you're seeing the Clinton news networks come out and say, this is security failures.
[00:25:18.138 --> 00:25:23.242]  It had nothing to do with Hillary Clinton, just already kind of getting her off, off the trouble there.
[00:25:23.282 --> 00:25:34.711]  But we know from leaked emails that have already come out between that she sent immediately to her daughter, Chelsea, as well as some foreign dignitaries that they were behind closed doors and immediately calling it a terrorist attack.
[00:25:35.512 --> 00:25:40.175]  To the American people and to the families of those who died in there.
[00:25:40.735 --> 00:25:44.297]  They were calling it, you know, a YouTube video.
[00:25:44.397 --> 00:25:46.138]  We're not clear on what the circumstances.
[00:25:46.198 --> 00:25:47.699]  This is an intelligence failure.
[00:25:47.739 --> 00:25:49.240]  That's what she was, she was labeling this.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.181]  She were absolutely right.
[00:25:50.201 --> 00:25:52.142]  She was calling it terrorism behind closed doors.
[00:25:52.522 --> 00:25:55.544]  But the public narrative was very different than what she was actually calling it.
[00:25:55.644 --> 00:25:58.786]  And, you know, it's heartbreaking to know what Ambassador Stevens was going through.
[00:25:58.966 --> 00:26:02.648]  On June the 7th, 2012, he requested, he pleaded for security.
[00:26:02.688 --> 00:26:03.149]  He said, look,
[00:26:04.089 --> 00:26:05.590]  September 11th is coming.
[00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:06.870]  The anniversary of this is coming.
[00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:11.532]  The revolution that's underway post-Gaddafi, tensions are heightened here.
[00:26:11.592 --> 00:26:12.832]  I need people guarding me.
[00:26:12.852 --> 00:26:14.293]  I need added boots on the ground.
[00:26:14.333 --> 00:26:17.594]  But Obama, he was going to protect that legacy no matter what.
[00:26:17.634 --> 00:26:19.034]  He was taking the boots off the ground.
[00:26:19.094 --> 00:26:22.255]  It was more important to him than these four men that died.
[00:26:22.295 --> 00:26:23.756]  That's very clear reading this.
[00:26:24.096 --> 00:26:33.522]  Right, and even now, years out, it's still very important to them to get Hillary Clinton in, Obama's going to back her, even though she has kind of snubbed him as well here.
[00:26:33.922 --> 00:26:39.506]  Apparently they're saying that government officials failed to act on Obama's orders.
[00:26:40.046 --> 00:26:52.798]  And so despite President Obama and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta's clear orders to deploy military assets, nothing was sent to Benghazi, nothing was unwrapped to Libya at the time that the last two Americans were killed almost eight hours later.
[00:26:53.339 --> 00:26:58.284]  And we also know that a fleet anti-terrorism security team sat on a plane
[00:26:58.704 --> 00:27:02.026]  For three hours they changed in and out of their uniforms four different times.
[00:27:02.046 --> 00:27:13.433]  So there was plenty of opportunity for them to get in there and do something about it, but instead the Americans had to actually be pulled out by Gaddafi supporters, not even by any of our own people.
[00:27:13.614 --> 00:27:18.717]  It's despicable when you think about the facts surrounding what happened to Ambassador Stevens and these three other men.
[00:27:18.817 --> 00:27:20.758]  It's absolutely inexcusable.
[00:27:22.319 --> 00:27:31.849]  It's not only a failure to act, it's an egregious, it's a dereliction of duty, if you will, because these men, they represent our whole country and what happened to them, it's inexcusable.
[00:27:31.869 --> 00:27:34.992]  Hillary Clinton is trying not to fall on her sword.
[00:27:35.072 --> 00:27:36.594]  This is about saving face.
[00:27:36.614 --> 00:27:42.360]  You know, The Guardian did a piece 11 minutes after Trey Gowdy took to the airways and mentioned this report.
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:46.061]  Hillary Clinton's response was, it's time to get over it.
[00:27:46.181 --> 00:27:46.821]  Oh, really?
[00:27:46.861 --> 00:27:49.441]  Well, I think it's time to get to the bottom of it, actually.
[00:27:49.581 --> 00:27:52.742]  Absolutely, and we will find out what difference it does make.
[00:27:53.282 --> 00:28:09.745]  Minutes before the president delivered his speech in the Rose Garden, there was an email that was sent to Ben Rhodes and others saying there wasn't really much violence in Egypt, and we're not saying that the violence in Libya erupted over inflammatory videos, but then we have Susan Rice going out and saying that, and they actually
[00:28:10.385 --> 00:28:10.505]  Yes.
[00:28:28.251 --> 00:28:34.756]  Putting all of their focus on how they can spin this and turn it into an attack about a video, and that is getting to the bottom of it.
[00:28:34.816 --> 00:28:47.725]  That is where she wants people to move on because she doesn't want them to see her role that she played in it with her emails that she tried to delete that showed that she was having these conversations with her daughter, counter to what she'd been telling the American people.
[00:28:47.745 --> 00:28:51.027]  You know, deleting emails while we're on the subject.
[00:28:52.666 --> 00:28:58.129]  One Trump attorney, he tweeted something that was getting major flack on every national media program this morning.
[00:28:58.149 --> 00:29:02.931]  This tweet about Hillary Clinton and how she sold uranium to the Russians under her fake charity.
[00:29:03.011 --> 00:29:08.053]  He took it a step further, blaming the murder of Stevens on Hillary Clinton.
[00:29:08.073 --> 00:29:09.073]  That's what's on the table here.
[00:29:09.094 --> 00:29:10.174]  I don't want people to forget that.
[00:29:10.194 --> 00:29:11.935]  I want them to carefully look at these facts.
[00:29:12.435 --> 00:29:13.195]  We're good to go.
[00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:43.555]  People are awake, Leigh-Anne, they understand what's at stake, they know what's going on, and it makes me sick to hear the spin that's coming out of this now.
[00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:47.178]  It's just, it's such a disrespect to these men who died.
[00:29:47.398 --> 00:29:47.618]  Right.
[00:29:48.078 --> 00:29:58.006]  And we know that there were some security officers there warning everyone, sending out these emails, like you mentioned, that they need help, they need security, this is a suicide mission to have people stationed there.
[00:29:58.386 --> 00:30:03.690]  Did these emails make it to the spam folder because people weren't able to send her actually any
[00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:05.051]  I mean, total dereliction of duty.
[00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:25.070]  Right.
[00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:28.274]  And you are, I mean, the benefit of the doubt, maybe it went to a spam folder.
[00:30:28.314 --> 00:30:34.482]  What we do know is that that June the 7th email that Chris Stevens sent to the State Department, it was replied back to.
[00:30:34.542 --> 00:30:36.384]  He was requesting that step up in security.
[00:30:36.485 --> 00:30:37.686]  They said no.
[00:30:37.786 --> 00:30:38.627]  That's the bottom line.
[00:30:38.647 --> 00:30:39.508]  They said no more.
[00:30:40.309 --> 00:30:43.270]  And there isn't any more clear evidence than that.
[00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:44.811]  That happens on June the 7th.
[00:30:44.851 --> 00:30:49.893]  In September, of course, he's murdered, raped, brutalized, his body torched.
[00:30:50.214 --> 00:30:51.854]  Despicable things happened to him.
[00:30:51.874 --> 00:30:55.296]  You know, we would be looking at a completely different outlook, Leigh-Anne.
[00:30:55.316 --> 00:31:03.740]  I would be able to give her the credit that she's due if she had just replied with a yes, you can have the proper security, we're going to protect you.
[00:31:05.401 --> 00:31:12.052]  Knowing the story of what happened to Ambassador Stevens, and to say that she really cared about him as well, it really hurt her.
[00:31:12.092 --> 00:31:19.644]  But then to be able to come out and try to save her own skin, to famously say, you know, what difference at this point does it make?
[00:31:20.004 --> 00:31:24.465]  Because she really does not want any of the light to shine on her and I agree.
[00:31:24.505 --> 00:31:27.385]  People really need to read that 800 pages.
[00:31:27.425 --> 00:31:47.009]  They need to take the time and not allow the networks out there that are fully circling the wagons around Hillary Clinton to get her elected and see that once again there is a huge issue here that the original lies themselves were being perpetrated to save face for the Obama administration and now they're trying to do it again for Hillary Clinton.
[00:31:47.549 --> 00:31:51.633]  Perhaps the grossest failure on record in U.S.
[00:31:51.673 --> 00:31:54.096]  history regarding a situation like this.
[00:31:54.756 --> 00:31:54.917]  Yeah.
[00:31:55.677 --> 00:31:56.779]  Well, thank you very much, Margaret.
[00:31:57.139 --> 00:31:58.240]  Glad to have you on board.
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.301]  Thank you.
[00:31:59.321 --> 00:32:01.964]  Well, stick around because Joe Biggs is going to be joining me in studio.
[00:32:02.004 --> 00:32:09.592]  We're going to talk about Trump's speech on the economy and what illegal immigration is going to do here in this country to make that even worse.
[00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:19.995]  You traitors claiming I'm a Ruski agent, say it to my face and I'll break your nose.
[00:32:20.235 --> 00:32:20.896]  I'm sick of it.
[00:32:21.136 --> 00:32:24.139]  I will stomp your head in the ground, you traitorous maggots.
[00:32:24.399 --> 00:32:37.571]  While we go under Obamacare, North American Union, conquered by European banks, announcing our kids don't belong to us, total bondage, total surveillance, and you want to shoot your mouth off about me being a Ruski agent, I will stomp your head in the ground.
[00:32:37.831 --> 00:32:43.576]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 proof.
[00:32:43.996 --> 00:32:47.900]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.584]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important
[00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:06.546]  I think?
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.
[00:33:57.342 --> 00:34:05.626]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, when products are sold out, you're unable to get them, sometimes for months, but we hold back the products for people that have already signed up for AutoShip.
[00:34:06.286 --> 00:34:17.391]  When you choose AutoShip before checkout on your order at Infowarshore.com, we'll give you 10% off and give you guaranteed delivery of out-of-stock products that are on your AutoShip list.
[00:34:17.932 --> 00:34:20.553]  Plus, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:34:21.033 --> 00:34:28.437]  Listers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products when you need them each month.
[00:34:29.474 --> 00:34:30.494]  Now it's finally here.
[00:34:30.954 --> 00:34:34.455]  AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:34:34.775 --> 00:34:35.255]  It's easy.
[00:34:35.295 --> 00:34:42.117]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product, click on the AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:34:42.937 --> 00:34:49.699]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, it's a sure win.
[00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:53.400]  You add to that free shipping on orders of $50, it is a can't lose.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:35:01.110]  Visit InfoWarsTore.com and save 10% off on your next InfoWars Live order by selecting auto ship at checkout and get free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:04.155]  That's InfoWarsTore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:03.285 --> 00:37:12.488]  As it was in the legend of Saint George and the Dragon, the European Union is nothing less than a plague-wielding dragon, feeding on the welfare of the European people.
[00:37:12.648 --> 00:37:21.550]  And as it was in that very same legend, those that chose to remain under the dragon's control would vote to turn over everything to that dragon.
[00:37:21.771 --> 00:37:30.173]  And now, that dragon is on a short leash, meekly begging for a second chance so it can destroy everything in its path.
[00:37:30.453 --> 00:37:39.461]  Kurt Nimmo writes, the establishment is pushing a buyer's remorse narrative in the wake of Brexit and the globalist George Soros is leading the charge.
[00:37:39.842 --> 00:37:47.369]  Soros said during the annual meeting of the European Council of Foreign Relations, it was in general what you call buyer's remorse.
[00:37:47.769 --> 00:37:52.974]  It included everyone, the people who voted for leave, those who voted for remain, and those who didn't vote.
[00:37:53.314 --> 00:37:58.057]  According to Soros, the British people are not serious about leaving the EU.
[00:37:58.217 --> 00:38:03.119]  They simply want to express their discontent with their political situation in Europe.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:08.042]  And now that Brexit is a reality, they are demonstrating buyer's remorse.
[00:38:08.442 --> 00:38:11.704]  The corporate media has adopted Soros' narrative.
[00:38:12.004 --> 00:38:13.765]  Is there any chance of a second referenda?
[00:38:13.785 --> 00:38:14.746]  Is there any going back?
[00:38:15.742 --> 00:38:20.267]  There's a lot of buyer's remorse and there's a lot of concern amongst the Remainers, obviously.
[00:38:20.407 --> 00:38:25.993]  ABC News points to a survey poll conducted for the Mail on Sunday after the Brexit vote.
[00:38:26.253 --> 00:38:33.881]  It claims of the 17.4 million who voted to leave, 1.1 million actually wished they had voted Remain.
[00:38:34.261 --> 00:38:37.564]  Because if we're going to wait for a successor to David Cameron,
[00:38:54.255 --> 00:38:55.116]  Further thinking.
[00:38:55.496 --> 00:39:01.679]  We're not going to invoke Article 50 or start the serious renegotiation of our trade relationship until later on this year.
[00:39:02.119 --> 00:39:04.221]  Actually, that is a period of indecision.
[00:39:04.361 --> 00:39:11.144]  Another escape hatch might be the Parliaments of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales refusing to approve Brexit.
[00:39:11.305 --> 00:39:17.428]  On Monday, an online petition calling for a second vote had 3.8 million signatures.
[00:39:17.668 --> 00:39:27.915]  Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's campaign manager, said Brexit represents a rejection of globalism and faceless bureaucrats ruling the lives of millions of people.
[00:39:28.195 --> 00:39:34.600]  However, globalist shill President Barack Obama would have the American people led astray yet again.
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:46.968]  I think it's important to remember that Mr. Trump embodies global elites and has taken full advantage of it his entire life and so he's hardly a spokesperson for
[00:39:48.622 --> 00:39:55.427]  A legitimate spokesperson for a populist surge from working class people on either side of the Atlantic.
[00:40:18.422 --> 00:40:19.043]  We're good to go.
[00:40:34.838 --> 00:40:44.692]  In the preamble to the text, the two ministers write, Our countries share a common destiny and a common set of values that give rise to an even closer union between our citizens.
[00:40:45.033 --> 00:40:49.840]  Immediately after the Brexit, many people in England texted, What is the European Union?
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:41:11.352]  Well, simply put, the European Union was created in 1955 at Bilderberg by the very same globalists that have risen to their current status as the enemy of humankind, fomenting quiet wars utilizing a myriad of weapons in order to establish a new world order, which those very same globalists are incredibly close to finalizing.
[00:41:11.632 --> 00:41:14.874]  And now the rest of Europe is following Great Britain's lead.
[00:41:15.354 --> 00:41:40.167]  If the British people do fold under the weight of doom and gloom shelled out by the very globalists they are trying to escape from, and return like frightened children to their sociopathic mummy and daddy at the EU, the imaginary consequences the mainstream media would have the British people frightened of now would become very real in the near future, resulting in complete and total submission under a European super-state,
[00:41:40.487 --> 00:41:46.935]  Run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels so arrogant and powerful, England would cease to exist.
[00:41:47.216 --> 00:41:50.259]  It is the EU that must cease to exist.
[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.883]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:42:19.471 --> 00:42:22.472]  Hello, we're journalists.
[00:42:23.113 --> 00:42:23.473]  Okay.
[00:42:24.133 --> 00:42:25.474]  Do you speak Spanish?
[00:42:25.934 --> 00:42:26.174]  Yes.
[00:42:28.315 --> 00:42:28.776]  How are you?
[00:42:28.896 --> 00:42:29.176]  Good.
[00:42:29.376 --> 00:42:30.136]  As good as can be.
[00:42:30.156 --> 00:42:30.837]  Michael.
[00:42:39.306 --> 00:42:41.847]  Are you from Mexico?
[00:42:42.447 --> 00:42:44.948]  El Salvador.
[00:42:45.048 --> 00:42:45.329]  Everyone?
[00:42:46.489 --> 00:42:48.090]  Yes.
[00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:48.750]  We came together.
[00:42:50.511 --> 00:42:53.032]  How long was your journey to get here?
[00:42:53.052 --> 00:42:56.493]  It took us two months.
[00:42:57.194 --> 00:43:02.556]  We were working and working on the way up until we got here, where we're at.
[00:43:02.596 --> 00:43:04.357]  We just want to complete the journey.
[00:43:04.377 --> 00:43:06.197]  We're already tired, thirsty, hungry.
[00:43:09.834 --> 00:43:13.876]  Eventually we'll get where we want to go.
[00:43:13.896 --> 00:43:16.197]  But it's getting impossible.
[00:43:16.217 --> 00:43:19.559]  It's kind of hot out here.
[00:43:19.619 --> 00:43:21.100]  I want to drink some water.
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:24.882]  But, uh, yeah, you got any questions for me?
[00:43:34.446 --> 00:43:35.667]  How long have they been traveling?
[00:43:35.867 --> 00:43:37.929]  They said it'd take two months to get here.
[00:43:38.029 --> 00:43:38.449]  Two months?
[00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:39.029]  Yeah.
[00:43:39.229 --> 00:43:41.031]  They've been traveling from El Salvador.
[00:43:41.851 --> 00:43:43.372]  Oh wow.
[00:43:43.392 --> 00:43:44.093]  What are their plans?
[00:43:45.874 --> 00:43:48.916]  What do you plan to do once you're in the United States?
[00:43:50.515 --> 00:43:52.836]  Well, we'll see what the good Lord gives us.
[00:43:53.476 --> 00:43:56.197]  Because only God is with us.
[00:43:56.357 --> 00:43:58.958]  We just want to arrive at our final destination.
[00:44:00.258 --> 00:44:06.060]  We'll see what the good Lord has in store for us.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.341]  Is there a city you're going to?
[00:44:07.421 --> 00:44:08.101]  Houston?
[00:44:08.221 --> 00:44:08.761]  Dallas?
[00:44:09.081 --> 00:44:11.062]  Yes, we're going to Houston, Texas.
[00:44:11.142 --> 00:44:12.503]  Are we on the right track?
[00:44:12.963 --> 00:44:14.003]  It's about 400 miles inland.
[00:44:14.043 --> 00:44:14.483]  It's pretty far.
[00:44:24.666 --> 00:44:26.607]  Well, we'll see how we get there.
[00:44:26.727 --> 00:44:30.049]  Do you have water in the truck?
[00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:32.410]  No, unfortunately we don't have water.
[00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:32.850]  No, sorry.
[00:44:47.028 --> 00:44:50.056]  We're good to go.
[00:44:50.136 --> 00:44:51.360]  Thank you.
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:52.984]  We're going to keep walking.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:59.204]  Here, you don't see immigration much, do you?
[00:45:59.244 --> 00:46:00.485]  Yes.
[00:46:00.945 --> 00:46:03.308]  We just saw three agent vehicles earlier.
[00:46:06.445 --> 00:46:08.066]  And a game warden as well.
[00:46:08.487 --> 00:46:09.768]  And will they pick you up?
[00:46:09.808 --> 00:46:11.550]  Yes, maybe not if you're from El Salvador.
[00:46:23.012 --> 00:46:25.273]  It's like water or food or something like that.
[00:46:25.394 --> 00:46:26.274]  Could it be?
[00:46:26.314 --> 00:46:28.035]  Yes, they're going to process it.
[00:46:28.075 --> 00:46:32.979]  But if they're from Mexico, I don't think they're going to process it.
[00:46:33.019 --> 00:46:34.600]  No, we're all from El Salvador.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:38.622]  Yes, yes, so they're going to... What did you say your name was?
[00:46:38.682 --> 00:46:39.023]  Adan.
[00:46:39.083 --> 00:46:40.283]  Adan Salazar.
[00:46:40.924 --> 00:46:42.605]  Jose Leonel, to be precise.
[00:46:42.645 --> 00:46:43.125]  Jose?
[00:46:44.646 --> 00:46:44.766]  Yes.
[00:46:44.786 --> 00:46:45.787]  Thank you.
[00:46:45.847 --> 00:46:45.967]  Me?
[00:46:46.427 --> 00:46:46.808]  Michael.
[00:46:47.008 --> 00:46:48.469]  Michael, I'm Jose Leonel.
[00:46:48.489 --> 00:46:50.170]  Nice to meet you.
[00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:52.849]  Let's see if God helps us.
[00:47:03.117 --> 00:47:07.480]  Get Brain Force at 25% off for a limited time at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.801]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.901 --> 00:47:16.705]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:16.945 --> 00:47:20.207]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.408]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.990]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:52.194]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com.

[00:49:05.049 --> 00:49:08.873]  Now Donald Trump is once again taking on the globalists in a speech today.
[00:49:08.933 --> 00:49:10.634]  He took aim at U.S.
[00:49:10.835 --> 00:49:14.959]  free trade deals in a speech that he delivered in Western Pennsylvania.
[00:49:15.559 --> 00:49:20.764]  And he was targeting globalization as a jobs killer with this free trade.
[00:49:20.804 --> 00:49:26.410]  He said globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very, very wealthy.
[00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:30.171]  But it's left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache.
[00:49:30.531 --> 00:49:44.914]  He also portrayed Clinton as an agent of the status quo that worships globalism over Americanism, and he criticized her past support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which he described as the death blow for American manufacturing.
[00:49:45.294 --> 00:49:46.814]  Now joining me, of course, is Joe Biggs.
[00:49:47.174 --> 00:49:47.894]  Biggs, what do you think?
[00:49:47.974 --> 00:49:50.295]  Is this going to resonate with the American people?
[00:49:50.335 --> 00:49:54.856]  It seems like if Trump really sticks with the economy and immigration, these are things where he
[00:49:55.596 --> 00:50:01.383]  Yeah, I think it's going to resonate with people pretty largely across the country right now.
[00:50:01.403 --> 00:50:08.271]  I mean, those are two topics that Donald's really going to have to hammer on because what we've seen with Brexit, what we've seen across the country,
[00:50:09.984 --> 00:50:12.045]  We need to hammer on those issues.
[00:50:12.065 --> 00:50:12.425]  Right.
[00:50:12.585 --> 00:50:23.992]  You know, the fact that we are sending jobs from America overseas, and yet we're sending companies like Ford and these other manufacturing companies down to Mexico, but what are we getting in return?
[00:50:24.492 --> 00:50:27.133]  We're getting some of the worst people from Mexico.
[00:50:27.473 --> 00:50:33.717]  Not all of them, there's a lot of great people that come over here, but there's a lot of the criminals that are being allowed to come over here, and what's that going to do?
[00:50:33.757 --> 00:50:35.818]  That's going to help collapse our economy.
[00:50:36.258 --> 00:50:37.438]  Right, seems to be the plan.
[00:50:37.458 --> 00:50:38.179]  Yeah, that's the plan.
[00:50:38.199 --> 00:50:39.639]  They want to form everything together.
[00:50:39.879 --> 00:50:51.682]  They want to have this North American Union to merge everything together, which will go into a larger picture of this new world order, this one world government, where we're all under this one dictator, one police force.
[00:50:52.042 --> 00:50:58.324]  You know, that's what's happening, and that's why this is so important for Donald Trump to talk about these issues like he is right now.
[00:50:58.564 --> 00:51:16.869]  Right, because what we're seeing of course with the mainstream media worldwide is that they're really trying to paint Brexit as just this tragedy, a frightening thing, I can't believe they did it, what were they thinking, it's going to be so terrible, because they don't want people to reclaim their sovereignty and to understand that what is happening here in the United States
[00:51:17.449 --> 00:51:20.370]  Isn't just a populist surge here.
[00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:21.250]  It's everywhere.
[00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:28.891]  People are starting to see that this globalization has been terrible for their economies and people are wanting to reclaim their sovereignty.
[00:51:29.452 --> 00:51:34.453]  And he's absolutely right to call free trade a job killer because we've seen it.
[00:51:34.533 --> 00:51:38.173]  It's that giant sucking sound and a new poll.
[00:51:38.574 --> 00:51:40.794]  So they're always kind of talking about these polls about how, you know,
[00:51:40.934 --> 00:51:50.277]  Hillary Clinton, she's got a five point lead and she's leading, but when it comes to the economy and that people are asked which president is more likely to grow the U.S.
[00:51:50.317 --> 00:51:56.358]  economy, voters are more confident that Donald Trump is going to be the president to help grow the economy.
[00:51:56.698 --> 00:51:58.919]  So, I mean, he's a jobs builder.
[00:51:58.939 --> 00:52:02.500]  You know, he actually has created some jobs where Hillary Clinton has not.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.781]  And she's more than willing to give even more jobs away.
[00:52:06.471 --> 00:52:13.453]  I think people are scared of Donald Trump because he's an unknown entity, but we have a proven criminal in Hillary Clinton.
[00:52:13.953 --> 00:52:16.733]  Her track record shows that she is a horrible person.
[00:52:17.173 --> 00:52:20.614]  You know, her track record at the State Department is flawed in so many ways.
[00:52:21.014 --> 00:52:27.216]  The fact that she's covered up for her husband who has raped women and done all this, these horrible things, Benghazi.
[00:52:27.536 --> 00:52:32.277]  The fact that, you know, we heard interviews on Alex Jones today, how people feel like
[00:52:33.706 --> 00:52:41.016]  Everything that's happened with this is being made a joke out of by the Republican Party to kind of take the focus off what's really going on.
[00:52:41.056 --> 00:52:43.799]  I mean, he has a proven track record.
[00:52:44.795 --> 00:52:48.976]  Of taking something and turning it into something that's really sought after.
[00:52:48.996 --> 00:52:49.437]  Right.
[00:52:49.457 --> 00:52:50.757]  You know, an image, branding.
[00:52:50.777 --> 00:52:53.018]  And that's kind of what we have to redo right now in America.
[00:52:53.038 --> 00:52:59.940]  We have to rebrand ourselves in a sense, because across the country, freedom is now being looked at as something that's bad.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:00.360]  Right.
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:03.141]  You know, with what happened with Brexit, people are like, oh, you shouldn't break away.
[00:53:03.201 --> 00:53:04.121]  No, that's awesome.
[00:53:04.321 --> 00:53:04.441]  Right.
[00:53:04.461 --> 00:53:05.242]  We should praise that.
[00:53:05.282 --> 00:53:09.183]  We should encourage these other countries to do the exact same thing and follow suit.
[00:53:09.403 --> 00:53:09.583]  Right.
[00:53:09.603 --> 00:53:20.191]  Well, and also kind of trying to put that message out there that these people are crazy for wanting to build a wall around their country that is being overrun by illegal immigrants that are flooding their country.
[00:53:20.311 --> 00:53:21.372]  It is an invasion.
[00:53:21.752 --> 00:53:22.733]  It's not immigration.
[00:53:22.773 --> 00:53:28.097]  There's no way that you can take care of people when they come over in those amount of numbers.
[00:53:28.177 --> 00:53:31.820]  And people are just wanting to reclaim the ability to say no.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:35.102]  And then talk about a wall and this North American Union.
[00:53:35.122 --> 00:53:36.103]  So the Mexican president
[00:53:36.503 --> 00:53:36.743]  I think?
[00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:07.083]  I don't know.
[00:54:27.888 --> 00:54:28.930]  We're good to go.
[00:54:43.652 --> 00:54:44.133]  I don't think so.
[00:54:59.471 --> 00:55:06.756]  And they're doing this to boost figures so that they can show society that the government's security efforts are yielding results.
[00:55:06.776 --> 00:55:08.597]  They're saying, well, look at all these arrests we're making.
[00:55:08.657 --> 00:55:09.998]  We're helping to take down crime.
[00:55:10.298 --> 00:55:15.782]  But really, they're just going after easy targets that they can threaten with rape or actually rape beat.
[00:55:16.242 --> 00:55:17.683]  I mean, it's just disgusting.
[00:55:17.864 --> 00:55:22.347]  And I looked at these articles today, and the wall just got 10 feet higher.
[00:55:23.462 --> 00:55:25.584]  I mean, we're bringing in people with a gang mentality.
[00:55:25.604 --> 00:55:26.585]  I mean, that's the issue.
[00:55:26.945 --> 00:55:28.607]  You know, there are people that come through who are good.
[00:55:28.627 --> 00:55:31.810]  Like I said before, I'm not trying to say immigration is not the problem.
[00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:34.592]  Illegal immigration is the problem.
[00:55:35.073 --> 00:55:45.242]  And the fact that Obama essentially has a stand-down order to all Border Patrol to let any and everybody through without any kind of checks, people coming through with diseases.
[00:55:45.282 --> 00:55:46.143]  We have video of them coming through.
[00:55:46.163 --> 00:55:46.684]  What's going to happen?
[00:55:46.704 --> 00:55:49.547]  When people start getting sick, they're not even quarantining them at the border.
[00:55:49.567 --> 00:55:51.029]  They have that yellow police tape up.
[00:55:51.049 --> 00:55:52.070]  You see a murder scene.
[00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:54.593]  That's not going to stop a disease from spreading.
[00:55:54.773 --> 00:55:54.873]  Right.
[00:55:54.893 --> 00:56:01.621]  And Jakari Jackson, Adon Salazar, Michael Zimmerman are down there at the border again, two years later from when we originally broke the news.
[00:56:01.642 --> 00:56:03.904]  I've been down to the border numerous times.
[00:56:04.665 --> 00:56:15.075]  Catching drugs coming across the border, you know, the criminals, the gang bimmers, you know, the fact that they're trying to use it as this beard to say, well, there's kids coming across, you know, there's the dreamers.
[00:56:15.295 --> 00:56:15.416]  Right.
[00:56:15.516 --> 00:56:18.038]  Yeah, there's some of those, but that's a small aspect.
[00:56:18.358 --> 00:56:20.240]  We're bringing in people with a gang mentality.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:27.667]  We have a situation at Fort Bliss last week where two soldiers were caught at the Falfuris border checkpoint smuggling people in.
[00:56:28.328 --> 00:56:29.009]  And why is that?
[00:56:29.069 --> 00:56:38.136]  Because we have such a lack of leadership in America that people with a gang mentality can get themselves into the military, keep their nose clean for a while, and then start smuggling people in.
[00:56:38.536 --> 00:56:39.317]  And why do we do that?
[00:56:39.397 --> 00:56:40.238]  Why is this happening?
[00:56:40.698 --> 00:56:45.442]  Because the only kind of people in their right mind that want this to stop are people like us who are awake.
[00:56:45.462 --> 00:56:46.603]  We want to put a stop to this.
[00:56:46.623 --> 00:56:47.544]  We want to put a border up.
[00:56:47.764 --> 00:56:48.405]  We don't want to stop
[00:56:49.266 --> 00:56:49.846]  Immigration.
[00:56:49.866 --> 00:56:51.727]  We want to stop the bad people from coming in.
[00:56:51.947 --> 00:56:53.327]  There needs to be a checks and balances.
[00:56:53.547 --> 00:56:55.368]  We need to find out who it is that's coming across.
[00:56:55.388 --> 00:56:56.668]  We need to find out what they have.
[00:56:57.048 --> 00:56:58.229]  Because those people come through.
[00:56:58.249 --> 00:56:59.109]  They start getting sick.
[00:56:59.389 --> 00:57:01.110]  We have quarantine set up all over the place.
[00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:02.630]  Our economy is going to crash.
[00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:06.831]  And next thing you know, they're going to be like, well, maybe Obama should just go ahead and stay in.
[00:57:06.931 --> 00:57:10.873]  Or maybe, you know, we'll blame it all on Donald Trump and let him take the presidency.
[00:57:11.173 --> 00:57:12.293]  And then we'll go, look at this.
[00:57:12.313 --> 00:57:14.074]  This is what happens when a Republican takes over.
[00:57:14.374 --> 00:57:15.394]  Let's bring in our people.
[00:57:15.654 --> 00:57:18.295]  And then they've already brought in all their votes because
[00:57:18.635 --> 00:57:21.156]  The illegal immigrants are going to come over here and they're going to go, you know what?
[00:57:21.536 --> 00:57:22.676]  I'm going to vote for that Democrat.
[00:57:22.916 --> 00:57:30.358]  Well, and that's the thing, is if you see all of the states where they're taking the refugees, the resettlements, they're taking them to all the red states to turn them blue.
[00:57:30.738 --> 00:57:34.439]  So, and you're absolutely right about that, is they're wanting to create that voting block there.
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:42.922]  It's so transparent, it's absolutely frightening, and if you think about it, now they've got several cases of babies being born with Zika here in the United States.
[00:57:43.342 --> 00:57:53.606]  So these are things that could be stopped or at least, you know, we need to look at this truthfully and frankly, but they're trying to make it, oh, Trump's going to deport everyone.
[00:57:53.646 --> 00:57:55.207]  He's going to take out everyone's families.
[00:57:55.647 --> 00:57:57.788]  No, it's about responsible participation.
[00:57:57.868 --> 00:58:04.791]  If you're one of these young ladies that just graduated as the valedictorian of your university and your parents brought you here, you had not,
[00:58:05.191 --> 00:58:06.873]  I personally, I'm okay with that.
[00:58:06.933 --> 00:58:09.195]  I think that, you know, something does need to happen.
[00:58:09.496 --> 00:58:18.505]  But what we need to talk about is people that haven't been here forever, that don't agree with our Western values, that don't unite with what America stands for.
[00:58:18.846 --> 00:58:19.646]  That's a problem.
[00:58:19.987 --> 00:58:26.674]  And we can look at what's happening in Europe with Muslim asylum seekers raping women because they had a bad day.
[00:58:26.874 --> 00:58:27.414]  Well, hold on.
[00:58:27.614 --> 00:58:28.395]  You're being a racist.
[00:58:28.475 --> 00:58:29.295]  You're being sexist.
[00:58:29.315 --> 00:58:30.436]  You're being Islamophobic.
[00:58:31.196 --> 00:58:31.736]  It's ridiculous.
[00:58:31.776 --> 00:58:32.717]  Tone down your rhetoric, all right?
[00:58:32.957 --> 00:58:33.657]  But listen to this.
[00:58:34.017 --> 00:58:44.602]  Donald Trump says if we're going to deliver real change, we're going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation by being pushed by powerful corporations, media elites, and political dynasties.
[00:58:44.822 --> 00:58:45.882]  He's the only one saying it.
[00:58:46.623 --> 00:58:47.443]  Clear your mind.
[00:58:47.683 --> 00:58:48.504]  Look at the true picture.
[00:58:48.664 --> 00:58:50.324]  Put your emotions away.
[00:58:50.444 --> 00:58:51.305]  And these are the facts.
