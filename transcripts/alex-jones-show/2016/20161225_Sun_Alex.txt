[00:00:14.902 --> 00:00:16.103]  Isn't this Bing Crosby?
[00:00:17.524 --> 00:00:19.286]  Isn't he like a thought criminal or something now?
[00:00:19.326 --> 00:00:20.967]  They said white Christmas is racist.
[00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.091]  I thought it meant snow.
[00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:30.054]  You know, like your kids say, boy, I want to see snow.
[00:00:32.797 --> 00:00:35.399]  My younger daughter hasn't seen it since she was about four years old.
[00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:36.139]  She's eight now.
[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.202]  She said, could we go to Colorado this year or somewhere?
[00:00:39.222 --> 00:00:40.043]  I hear there's snow there.
[00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:42.306]  And I said, honey, we're going to stay home.
[00:00:42.326 --> 00:00:43.787]  There's too much going on in the world right now.
[00:00:43.847 --> 00:00:46.490]  But maybe in February or something, there's still snow.
[00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.071]  We'll go there.
[00:00:47.792 --> 00:00:54.540]  She didn't know she was racist because she wanted to see all those billions of snowflakes that form that beautiful white.
[00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:59.333]  Snow on the ground has nothing to do with what color it is.
[00:00:59.413 --> 00:01:05.856]  It's not dreaming of white people, but they've so brainwashed the left and their minions that they think it's bad.
[00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:11.879]  You know, that was last year that colleges and places said that don't have Christmas parties and don't even say the word holiday.
[00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.040]  It's gotten worse this year.
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.861]  They're now saying, baby, it's cold outside.
[00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:16.962]  It's a song about rape.
[00:01:17.622 --> 00:01:18.983]  And so you can't have that.
[00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.537]  What it really is is a cult, as I talk about a lot, that wants to totally impose its will on you.
[00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:29.644]  And the answer to the cult is to openly exercise your rights and put it back in the bully's faces.
[00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:36.135]  I remember 15 years ago when I first started seeing concealed carry rallies in Austin, Texas, people wearing guns openly.
[00:01:36.655 --> 00:01:40.959]  I was so conditioned at first, even though I was pro-Second Amendment, that I was like, maybe that's too much, maybe it's dangerous.
[00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:44.681]  But no, I figured out, these people are geniuses, and I talked to them.
[00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:46.423]  You're out openly carrying.
[00:01:46.823 --> 00:01:49.385]  It's only concealed carry that's normally illegal, because it's concealed.
[00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:51.746]  That goes back to common law, wear your weapons openly.
[00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:55.970]  So you have to get a license to do something that would otherwise be illegal.
[00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.413]  And I'm all for concealed because it makes the criminals not know where the guns are and it doesn't freak out liberals.
[00:02:00.773 --> 00:02:07.898]  But why not really just openly wear the guns to exercise your right and say, look, you keep implying guns are illegal.
[00:02:08.758 --> 00:02:10.700]  You keep implying no one can have them.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:23.869]  I mean, I remember until I was about a teenager, even growing up in Dallas, you'd see people driving around in their own trucks with a gun rack with a .30-06 or a .308 or a .223 or a shotgun, a Remington shotgun or a Winchester Defender.
[00:02:25.293 --> 00:02:25.854]  In their car.
[00:02:26.094 --> 00:02:29.877]  And then suddenly you didn't see that anymore by the 90s because the police would pull you over and harass you.
[00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:41.907]  That's a right you had in almost every state and county and city, but they were creating the illusion through Hollywood and all these made-for-TV movies and cop shows that are based in Chicago or other places where they pull you over and go, you got a gun, you're going to prison.
[00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:43.620]  I got you with a gun!
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.100]  Possession!
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.561]  That's only in a few cities like D.C., New York.
[00:02:47.102 --> 00:02:48.202]  You name it, they have that in place.
[00:02:48.262 --> 00:02:54.226]  But they create the perception of zero tolerance by a kid in his article at school.
[00:02:54.246 --> 00:02:57.368]  Wrote an article about hunting and talked about hunting dogs with a shotgun.
[00:02:57.408 --> 00:02:58.368]  He wrote the word shotgun.
[00:02:58.588 --> 00:02:59.429]  Expel Jimmy!
[00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.171]  They want to bully us into submission.
[00:03:03.471 --> 00:03:06.933]  And the answer to that bullying is to say, no, no, no.
[00:03:08.624 --> 00:03:10.405]  And to openly practice Christianity.
[00:03:10.425 --> 00:03:21.253]  You know, I remember growing up hearing hardcore Christians go, the Tenenbaum is really Germanic, and it's a winter solstice ritual, and the Deep of Winter, and it's occultic, so they wanted Christmas shut down because of that.
[00:03:21.313 --> 00:03:23.975]  Look, God doesn't care if we like pretty trees and lights.
[00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:24.836]  It's art.
[00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:26.377]  We're not trying to be satanic.
[00:03:26.858 --> 00:03:31.001]  To the super, you know, right-wing Christians, in my view, I mean, I'm not saying you're bad, just come on.
[00:03:31.881 --> 00:03:32.622]  God judges the heart.
[00:03:33.103 --> 00:03:42.232]  But on the other side, you've got the crazy leftists and the jihadists who want it banned because they want to dominate culture and run over people with trucks and 18-wheelers and the media covering it up.
[00:03:42.332 --> 00:03:44.874]  So, this is the insanity.
[00:03:45.435 --> 00:03:54.824]  The answer is to exercise our First Amendment, to exercise our right to eat non-GMO, to exercise our right to everything, free speech, you name it, or we will lose it.
[00:03:56.701 --> 00:04:13.210]  To realize free speech is under attack, InfoWars is under attack, the free press is under attack, so I want to thank you all for your support, and I want to encourage all of you to continue to support us right into next year, because I never thought InfoWars would become the spearhead, the tip of the spear, the whole nine yards.
[00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:22.355]  We are, but that's because we are representing basically you, and your will, and your honor, and your courage to be free.
[00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:46.693]  We're going to go to break, and we're looking back at a few days after the election in the middle of November, I guess Tuesday was November 8th, so 9th or 13th or whatever it was, when we had the Sunday broadcast, and I kind of laid out what I thought Trump would try to do, how they would try to counter him, the fact that they'd try to block his election, which they did do, and as of taping this for the Sunday broadcast, they haven't overthrown Trump yet, but
[00:04:47.193 --> 00:04:48.553]  They're openly calling for him to be killed.
[00:04:48.573 --> 00:04:48.994]  You name it.
[00:04:49.034 --> 00:04:50.554]  So, let's pray for America.
[00:04:50.614 --> 00:04:51.694]  Let's pray for a free world.
[00:04:51.954 --> 00:04:55.475]  Let's pray for Christians being persecuted in the Middle East and elsewhere by the jihadis.
[00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:57.956]  Let's pray for peace and a great awakening this Christmas.
[00:04:58.656 --> 00:05:00.377]  I'm very, very thankful and I'm very, very thankful to you.
[00:05:00.397 --> 00:05:03.238]  Let's also pray for Trump and pray for America and the unborn.
[00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:04.778]  Thanks to the crew and everybody else.
[00:05:04.818 --> 00:05:05.178]  I love you.
[00:05:05.198 --> 00:05:06.819]  We'll be right back with the retransmission.
[00:05:10.299 --> 00:05:14.162]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:14.463 --> 00:05:21.749]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:32.938]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:40.929]  In the history of InfoWars life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products, like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:50.542]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process, designed for maximized effects.
[00:05:50.842 --> 00:05:55.064]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:05:55.304 --> 00:06:02.026]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:06:02.346 --> 00:06:03.487]  That means it's clean.
[00:06:03.807 --> 00:06:04.907]  That means it's pure.
[00:06:04.967 --> 00:06:07.728]  That's infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:06:07.888 --> 00:06:09.569]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:06:22.287 --> 00:06:30.012]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:39.738 --> 00:06:43.801]  Last Sunday we were sitting here only two days out from the presidential election.
[00:06:45.242 --> 00:06:47.287]  Cueing our fingernails.
[00:06:47.327 --> 00:06:52.781]  I was telling you that the internal polls show Donald Trump is going to win basically every swing state unless Hillary tried to steal it.
[00:06:54.013 --> 00:06:55.053]  Well, we were proven right.
[00:06:55.434 --> 00:06:58.755]  He did win, but she successfully stole at least five states.
[00:06:59.275 --> 00:07:00.795]  The numbers are overwhelmingly clear.
[00:07:01.736 --> 00:07:08.898]  I had Bev Harris, the Democrat, the liberal, the top election fraud expert in the country, extremely bipartisan, totally respected.
[00:07:09.878 --> 00:07:14.460]  And she came out and laid out the fact that they were going to try to steal it from Trump beforehand, and they certainly did.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.322]  And she concurred on those key states where Hillary, the evidence that leans towards, stole it.
[00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:28.685]  Lots of evidence of late night, right as the polls are closing, some precincts getting 100% of the voters voting.
[00:07:29.025 --> 00:07:29.845]  That never happens.
[00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:32.006]  Or sometimes more than 100% voting.
[00:07:32.547 --> 00:07:33.267]  Major evidence.
[00:07:33.307 --> 00:07:39.709]  But despite that, despite that, still Donald Trump becomes the 45th President of the United States.
[00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:46.452]  I want to pull back here before I plunge into all the latest news and information.
[00:07:49.355 --> 00:07:51.036]  And I want people to savor this victory.
[00:07:52.237 --> 00:07:55.799]  I was the one Tuesday night, Wednesday morning saying, look, they're going to counter-strike.
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.121]  Soros will fund a bunch of riots.
[00:07:58.161 --> 00:07:59.782]  They're going to try to block him in Congress.
[00:08:00.383 --> 00:08:01.523]  Our fight has just begun.
[00:08:02.784 --> 00:08:06.747]  But it is important to basically think about what we have done together.
[00:08:08.048 --> 00:08:08.728]  Because it's big.
[00:08:09.549 --> 00:08:10.409]  It's very, very big.
[00:08:14.792 --> 00:08:18.395]  The entire establishment media has been discredited.
[00:08:21.348 --> 00:08:24.190]  All the pollsters have been turned into laughingstocks.
[00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:36.440]  The entire political correct cult trying to bully this country into submission to cultural tyranny has been blown into a million, million pieces.
[00:08:42.926 --> 00:08:44.067]  And the successes go on.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:51.266]  Globalism itself and the fact that crony capitalists control and manipulate the system worldwide has been exposed.
[00:08:52.327 --> 00:09:02.037]  This last year and a half campaign did more work to expose the global tyranny than all of the Liberty Movement's 60-year history to try to restore this republic.
[00:09:02.898 --> 00:09:09.084]  Because we're coming towards the peak, the crescendo here in the next decade or so, maybe even sooner.
[00:09:12.253 --> 00:09:22.701]  Donald Trump is already moving to fulfill his promises announcing he's going to reverse the climate deal Obama signed seven years ago without congressional approval.
[00:09:22.721 --> 00:09:27.145]  I have the articles right here, we'll go over them in a moment.
[00:09:27.185 --> 00:09:36.952]  We have John Kerry trying to race to get it ratified with other countries globally and completed before Trump takes office in two months.
[00:09:39.134 --> 00:09:40.095]  Think about them apples.
[00:09:41.991 --> 00:09:56.143]  Trump is announcing already that he is going to ignore the EPA's order to shut down another 500 power plants and allow the other clean burning plants that were shut down to get their licenses and fire back up.
[00:09:56.984 --> 00:09:59.426]  Get ready for more energy competition.
[00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:01.808]  Get ready for dropping prices.
[00:10:02.609 --> 00:10:06.452]  The hidden taxes against the poorest Americans of every race, color, and creed.
[00:10:09.468 --> 00:10:11.269]  Trump reportedly looking for a way to pull U.S.
[00:10:11.329 --> 00:10:12.190]  out of climate agreement.
[00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:15.352]  Looking for a way?
[00:10:16.914 --> 00:10:23.338]  Congress didn't pass it, so the Supreme Court just said that the EPA could do whatever they wanted to.
[00:10:23.358 --> 00:10:23.839]  Well, guess what?
[00:10:24.199 --> 00:10:25.160]  Guess who's over the EPA?
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.200]  El Presidente.
[00:10:26.461 --> 00:10:28.202]  He could abolish that cabinet position.
[00:10:29.743 --> 00:10:30.043]  The U.S.
[00:10:30.063 --> 00:10:32.805]  to push ahead on climate pact before Trump takes over.
[00:10:32.885 --> 00:10:35.988]  Kerry, Yahoo News, AP, Reuters.
[00:10:38.411 --> 00:10:38.791]  Report!
[00:10:38.871 --> 00:10:41.632]  Obama administration giving up on the Pacific trade deal.
[00:10:41.652 --> 00:10:47.853]  Not a trade deal, a global government deal to merge the Asian Union, the EU, and the American Union that have already all been set up through the Atlantic Treaty Agreement.
[00:10:49.153 --> 00:10:49.833]  And TPP.
[00:10:50.653 --> 00:10:51.433]  In deep trouble.
[00:10:52.873 --> 00:10:54.154]  Chalk that up to the patriots.
[00:10:54.254 --> 00:10:54.994]  You, the listeners.
[00:10:55.034 --> 00:10:56.094]  The heart of the Infowar.
[00:10:57.754 --> 00:10:58.414]  Chalk that up.
[00:11:01.695 --> 00:11:02.415]  To Donald Trump.
[00:11:02.435 --> 00:11:07.196]  The reason I wanted to start here with some positive news is
[00:11:08.263 --> 00:11:09.944]  We're now seeing the game plan against Trump.
[00:11:10.724 --> 00:11:21.911]  When he's still two months out and change, the rest of November, December, and then what, 18 days into January.
[00:11:21.951 --> 00:11:23.052]  We're more than two months out.
[00:11:23.812 --> 00:11:26.594]  We're more than 60 days out.
[00:11:26.614 --> 00:11:28.795]  67 days.
[00:11:29.315 --> 00:11:31.637]  Thank you Darius, you popped in my ear.
[00:11:31.657 --> 00:11:32.157]  67 days out.
[00:11:32.798 --> 00:11:35.039]  And they're already saying he failed and didn't deliver.
[00:11:39.059 --> 00:11:39.959]  That's going to be their tactic.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.901]  It's also going to be something I discovered yesterday that made me so mad it gave me a headache.
[00:11:44.921 --> 00:11:47.142]  And that rarely happens because I hate Amy Schumer.
[00:11:47.842 --> 00:11:55.805]  Ever since I saw her pig face on TV and her anti-family garbage and know that they force feed her to all the young girls in America and she's not even popular, she's a failure.
[00:11:56.905 --> 00:12:04.248]  I saw this headline, it punched me in the stomach because it was a fake headline the New York Times had put out in an article over a year ago that they had to retract.
[00:12:07.312 --> 00:12:12.575]  But for this, they dolled up... I'm going to show this to you later.
[00:12:12.595 --> 00:12:15.536]  It's up on Infowars.com with video.
[00:12:15.576 --> 00:12:24.200]  They dolled up a fake news headline from supposedly 20 years ago with yellowed, acid-damaged paper and jaggedly cut edges.
[00:12:26.041 --> 00:12:29.323]  And it's supposedly Donald Trump saying, if I were to run, I'd run as a Republican.
[00:12:29.683 --> 00:12:31.804]  They're the dumbest group of voters in the country.
[00:12:31.844 --> 00:12:33.465]  They believe anything on Fox News.
[00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:35.046]  I could lie and they'd still eat it up.
[00:12:35.526 --> 00:12:36.927]  I bet my numbers would be terrific.
[00:12:38.072 --> 00:12:41.315]  At the end of a lengthy article she puts out, she admits it's a fake quote.
[00:12:42.236 --> 00:12:48.401]  But she knows full well 90 plus percent of people would never read down to the bottom of it to find out she says it's fake.
[00:12:49.622 --> 00:12:51.184]  This is super fraud.
[00:12:52.765 --> 00:12:53.586]  Now why do I mention that?
[00:12:53.646 --> 00:12:57.910]  Because there's so many of these that I can't even cover them all.
[00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:03.515]  You're going to have to decipher it yourself, deal with it yourself, because a lot of the time they don't admit it's a fake.
[00:13:03.535 --> 00:13:04.656]  I mean I'm seeing stuff now
[00:13:06.567 --> 00:13:08.467]  Where they are saying things about me, which is fine.
[00:13:08.487 --> 00:13:09.047]  They're liars.
[00:13:09.087 --> 00:13:09.828]  They've been discredited.
[00:13:09.868 --> 00:13:10.788]  They've lost so far.
[00:13:11.388 --> 00:13:12.848]  But they're going to the next level.
[00:13:12.888 --> 00:13:13.728]  They're not backing down.
[00:13:13.748 --> 00:13:15.168]  They're only intensifying their lies.
[00:13:15.869 --> 00:13:19.009]  Where they'll write the wildest crap about me that I never even said.
[00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:25.250]  They'll usually kind of trim it apart and move it around and change it when they lie.
[00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.791]  Now they're doing stuff just whole hog I never said.
[00:13:30.991 --> 00:13:35.272]  So... They're hitting next level, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:41.058 --> 00:13:41.958]  So it goes on and on.
[00:13:42.059 --> 00:13:44.340]  Now, that said, let me give you the big news here.
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.142]  Most people, if they had a lengthy conversation with President-elect, would tell you all about it.
[00:13:49.542 --> 00:13:51.523]  And the conversation was not off the record.
[00:13:51.563 --> 00:13:55.365]  I asked the President, Donald Trump, Friday if it was off the record.
[00:13:55.385 --> 00:13:55.905]  He said no.
[00:13:56.886 --> 00:13:59.707]  But most of the conversation is going to be off the record.
[00:14:03.369 --> 00:14:09.612]  Just because the enemies out there try to use this against the movement to restore the Republic.
[00:14:10.464 --> 00:14:12.285]  But I can assure you Donald Trump's for real.
[00:14:13.426 --> 00:14:14.627]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:14:15.448 --> 00:14:20.451]  And I'm going to give him my complete backing and confidence until I see the policies he starts to deliver.
[00:14:20.852 --> 00:14:22.573]  And he's going to try to deliver them or die fighting.
[00:14:23.414 --> 00:14:24.274]  He's never let me down.
[00:14:24.294 --> 00:14:25.755]  He's never let you down.
[00:14:25.775 --> 00:14:28.737]  And I happen to know for a fact that Donald Trump Jr.
[00:14:28.798 --> 00:14:29.558]  is not going to let you down.
[00:14:29.598 --> 00:14:30.819]  He's a big listener for years.
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.321]  And I'm going to just stop right there.
[00:14:37.722 --> 00:14:40.522]  But Donald Trump's for real, ladies and gentlemen, and that's why they're so scared of him.
[00:14:40.542 --> 00:14:47.844]  I have a clip coming up of Dave Chappelle up on InfoWars.com saying, let's give Donald Trump a chance.
[00:14:49.964 --> 00:14:51.684]  And I've always liked Dave Chappelle when I've seen him on TV.
[00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:56.945]  I went and saw his concert, and I guess he bought into the hype, and it was just the biggest race-baiting thing I ever heard.
[00:14:57.325 --> 00:15:02.766]  I want to hear some funny comedy, man, not about white people or black people or this or that, all this race comedy.
[00:15:02.826 --> 00:15:03.466]  It gets a little old.
[00:15:04.467 --> 00:15:05.867]  I've never been big on the race jokes.
[00:15:09.301 --> 00:15:17.608]  It's not that I've been politically correct all my life, I just like to think about people as individuals, and then if I don't like that individual, I'll tell you why I don't like them.
[00:15:17.648 --> 00:15:18.609]  It's not because of what color they are.
[00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:32.220]  But the old Dave Chappelle was back, and he just made a really great point about, we're saying this guy can't govern, he can't rule, just like people used to say black people couldn't rule or couldn't be in the White House.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.101]  And he goes, let's just give Donald Trump a chance.
[00:15:34.682 --> 00:15:36.964]  And only Dave Chappelle could say that in a Saturday Night Live audience.
[00:15:38.712 --> 00:15:39.672]  They didn't really even boo.
[00:15:41.713 --> 00:15:46.995]  Because really, what has Donald Trump done except say he tried to have major reinvestment in black communities and cut taxes?
[00:15:48.936 --> 00:15:52.177]  I mean, the truth is Donald Trump is going to deliver.
[00:15:53.418 --> 00:15:56.159]  And the media is going to do everything they can to try to stop it.
[00:15:57.219 --> 00:16:01.621]  Because the media works for foreign multinationals that want to sew this country up.
[00:16:01.641 --> 00:16:02.741]  They want to bag this nation up.
[00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:05.022]  They want us poor so they can buy everything up, folks.
[00:16:05.062 --> 00:16:05.782]  It's real simple.
[00:16:06.183 --> 00:16:06.823]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:06.843 --> 00:16:07.203]  Stay with us.
[00:16:19.071 --> 00:16:26.974]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[00:16:27.054 --> 00:16:30.136]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[00:16:30.953 --> 00:16:32.813]  And they're also very affordable.
[00:16:54.938 --> 00:17:01.682]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the InfoWar change the country and the world.
[00:17:02.082 --> 00:17:02.843]  It's a win-win.
[00:17:03.323 --> 00:17:04.303]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:17:09.226 --> 00:17:13.629]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:17:13.689 --> 00:17:24.635]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:17:24.775 --> 00:17:29.717]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:17:29.837 --> 00:17:32.338]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:33.898]  It helps detoxify.
[00:17:34.118 --> 00:17:36.959]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:17:36.999 --> 00:17:41.761]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:17:41.781 --> 00:17:48.003]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:17:48.043 --> 00:17:53.345]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:54.125]  I'm taking it now.
[00:17:54.485 --> 00:17:56.566]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.270]  You can't survive without it.
[00:18:12.471 --> 00:18:13.371]  But where do you get it?
[00:18:13.671 --> 00:18:19.453]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:18:19.653 --> 00:18:25.395]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:18:25.575 --> 00:18:33.338]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities.
[00:18:36.099 --> 00:18:42.441]  Including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:44.962]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:18:45.322 --> 00:18:46.502]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:18:46.783 --> 00:18:47.563]  Easy assembly.
[00:18:47.823 --> 00:18:48.463]  Low maintenance.
[00:18:48.743 --> 00:18:50.564]  Replacement filters are simple to install.
[00:18:50.844 --> 00:18:57.966]  And now, as part of an exclusive limited time introductory offer, you can save $20 off the retail price and get free shipping.
[00:18:58.106 --> 00:19:02.428]  This is a limited time offer, so order your unit today and receive free shipping and $20 off.
[00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:07.349]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:19:07.389 --> 00:19:11.210]  I mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but
[00:19:24.733 --> 00:19:32.337]  Right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:19:32.377 --> 00:19:38.701]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:19:38.801 --> 00:19:40.062]  These are all parasites.
[00:19:40.102 --> 00:19:41.202]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:42.263]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:19:42.563 --> 00:19:46.865]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:19:47.065 --> 00:19:50.227]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:19:50.367 --> 00:19:53.428]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:19:53.468 --> 00:19:54.469]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:19:54.509 --> 00:19:56.390]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:57.470]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:59.571]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:20:00.191 --> 00:20:02.072]  And you support the broadcast.
[00:20:02.132 --> 00:20:03.233]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:03.473 --> 00:20:05.354]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:20:05.754 --> 00:20:07.715]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:20:12.088 --> 00:20:18.031]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:21.452 --> 00:20:35.419]  It's always a tough boat because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt.
[00:20:36.039 --> 00:20:39.261]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not
[00:20:40.536 --> 00:20:41.777]  Increase our debt.
[00:20:41.817 --> 00:20:44.858]  It does not somehow promote profligacy.
[00:20:45.158 --> 00:20:55.323]  All it does is it says, you gotta pay the bills that you've already racked up Congress.
[00:20:55.363 --> 00:20:57.905]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:21:00.748 --> 00:21:07.754]  By the way, Nico Acosta, our great lead producer here for the radio slash TV transmission six days a week, 11 a.m.
[00:21:07.774 --> 00:21:09.695]  to 3 p.m.
[00:21:09.736 --> 00:21:12.458]  Central, and then of course we come back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:21:13.219 --> 00:21:16.802]  I came and I said, look at this, Nico, and he said, no, I put that on screen for you when you came in today.
[00:21:17.282 --> 00:21:25.109]  I'd forgotten the time Donald Trump, I guess 10 years ago, the 43rd president of the United States, now, but back in the future.
[00:21:26.553 --> 00:21:31.078]  He body slams the guy and of course there's a mock beat up of him.
[00:21:31.118 --> 00:21:33.160]  So he is a great actor.
[00:21:33.841 --> 00:21:39.206]  But he is going to actually deliver lower taxes and turn the carbon taxes off.
[00:21:39.306 --> 00:21:41.989]  That alone will be a death blow to the globalists.
[00:21:42.049 --> 00:21:43.771]  And he's moving in that direction right now.
[00:21:43.811 --> 00:21:48.156]  But for TV viewers, here it is, Donald Trump slamming down the opposition.
[00:21:50.335 --> 00:21:53.057]  We ought to get this and load this into the computer and actually play it with audio.
[00:21:53.617 --> 00:21:55.458]  Trump doing a mock beat-up.
[00:21:56.218 --> 00:21:57.119]  Oh, it's hilarious.
[00:21:57.519 --> 00:21:59.520]  Just the fact that he'd go out there and do all that.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.460]  He's so ridiculous.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:00.880]  I love it.
[00:22:01.801 --> 00:22:04.402]  He's got such an amazing sense of humor.
[00:22:07.649 --> 00:22:09.330]  Hey, will you guys get that with audio, please?
[00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.111]  I want to play this for everybody.
[00:22:11.531 --> 00:22:12.412]  There's Vince McMahon.
[00:22:13.232 --> 00:22:15.454]  Oh my gosh, he's going to get his head shaved when Trump beats him.
[00:22:16.334 --> 00:22:17.375]  Those guys are ridiculous.
[00:22:17.955 --> 00:22:19.636]  Okay, let's expand on all this.
[00:22:19.656 --> 00:22:30.122]  I want to play the Dave Chappelle clip in a little while, but first off, we've got to play this clip one more time, and then I'm going to walk through the attacks and what's going to happen.
[00:22:31.363 --> 00:22:33.224]  They're trying to get Prevost in right now.
[00:22:33.984 --> 00:22:35.425]  Steve Bannon was the general.
[00:22:36.923 --> 00:22:39.124]  Ran the attack, the best person in the campaign.
[00:22:39.204 --> 00:22:43.267]  I've talked to people inside the campaign, not just Roger Stone from outside the campaign.
[00:22:44.588 --> 00:22:47.570]  Bannon really kicked ass, the head of Breitbart.com.
[00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.752]  So we need Bannon to be the chief of staff.
[00:22:50.772 --> 00:22:51.772]  He's hardcore, folks.
[00:22:52.573 --> 00:22:57.476]  I mean, Bannon, since he took over Breitbart, they run my videos, they run our articles, they love what we do, they get it.
[00:22:57.756 --> 00:22:59.257]  They've gotten more hardcore like us.
[00:22:59.317 --> 00:23:05.041]  They've moved more towards drudge and info wars on the libertarian constitutional side than mainline Republican.
[00:23:06.249 --> 00:23:08.031]  And in some cases have surpassed what I've done.
[00:23:08.131 --> 00:23:09.913]  So I'm very, very excited to see that.
[00:23:11.335 --> 00:23:15.219]  Rince Priebus, the head of the Republican Party, backstabbed Trump a hundred different ways.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.944]  When Trump finally defeated him so many times, he kind of backed off at the end.
[00:23:20.759 --> 00:23:29.528]  But all I can tell you is we absolutely need to try to keep as many establishment people out as we can.
[00:23:29.588 --> 00:23:30.850]  Now, here's the deal.
[00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:37.277]  Obviously, Trump knows to really get things done, if someone who's been on the inside will come over to our side.
[00:23:38.937 --> 00:23:44.481]  That's fine, as long as the policies then flow towards the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[00:23:44.981 --> 00:23:55.727]  But if you get enough old guard neocons, Democrats, Republican establishment in, then the assassination temp level goes way up because they'll be able to come in and take over very, very quickly.
[00:23:57.369 --> 00:23:59.210]  Mike Pence is trusted by Trump.
[00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:00.931]  I trust the Vice President.
[00:24:01.894 --> 00:24:12.839]  He's a patriot, he's pro-gun, pro-sovereignty, he wants to control our borders, he's a little too pro-war towards Russia, but compared to Hillary Clinton, he is a peachenik.
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:25.625]  Now all of that said, I should have written notes about what I would talk about in my discussion with the President-elect Friday, because some of it would be newsmaking.
[00:24:26.125 --> 00:24:27.086]  Trump is just so real.
[00:24:29.844 --> 00:24:31.005]  It was all very, very positive.
[00:24:31.846 --> 00:24:34.928]  But later in the broadcast, I'm going to sit here and think about it during the break.
[00:24:34.948 --> 00:24:40.493]  I'm going to write down a few notes of what he told me, what we talked about, that I can relay to the viewers out there.
[00:24:40.553 --> 00:24:45.497]  But number one, he just called me to thank you.
[00:24:47.178 --> 00:24:48.739]  And to thank, of course, myself and the crew.
[00:24:48.759 --> 00:24:52.242]  They're fully aware that we had $85 million.
[00:24:52.262 --> 00:24:53.743]  We thought it was $75 million, the seven days.
[00:24:57.133 --> 00:24:59.482]  From a few days before the election right through to yesterday.
[00:25:00.225 --> 00:25:00.887]  So we're talking...
[00:25:02.732 --> 00:25:06.154]  80 plus million, conservatively, just on videos online.
[00:25:06.174 --> 00:25:06.874]  That's not counting.
[00:25:07.674 --> 00:25:09.055]  5 million a day terrestrial radio.
[00:25:09.095 --> 00:25:12.177]  We've gone from... We could never get above 170 affiliates.
[00:25:13.017 --> 00:25:17.359]  It's a few times 190, but it would always... Stations change hands, they sell, they change formats.
[00:25:17.899 --> 00:25:18.620]  We never got to 200.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:19.940]  We're at, like, 250.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.161]  It was, like, 230 a week ago.
[00:25:22.181 --> 00:25:23.282]  We're, like, 250 now?
[00:25:23.302 --> 00:25:26.703]  And we're talking blowtorch stations, AM, FM, across the country.
[00:25:27.804 --> 00:25:29.165]  The M4's taking over, folks.
[00:25:29.245 --> 00:25:29.865]  It's a big deal.
[00:25:31.411 --> 00:25:40.195]  Now some people, and I want to address this now because it's so important, and I'm going to come back and play all the clips for the next long segment, are saying, Alex, you're the establishment now.
[00:25:40.875 --> 00:25:41.695]  You're the elite now.
[00:25:42.956 --> 00:25:45.997]  We've gotten a beachhead in Washington that's tenuous.
[00:25:46.877 --> 00:25:47.798]  A big beachhead, though.
[00:25:47.858 --> 00:25:49.378]  Getting that beachhead is half the battle.
[00:25:51.419 --> 00:25:55.681]  In fact, if Trump has the initiative and we back him, I'd say 70% of the battle's won.
[00:25:57.315 --> 00:26:01.196]  The rest of it's moral for us individually in our own lives to work hard, be good people, and do the right thing.
[00:26:02.377 --> 00:26:07.599]  But we're at least 50% of the way there right now, but hey, that's a long way to fall as well.
[00:26:08.959 --> 00:26:10.160]  I'm the opposite of establishment.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:18.823]  I want to be the guy out in the wilderness that's trying to wake folks up and being able to be the purest and talk about what's right and what's good like Ron Paul does.
[00:26:19.203 --> 00:26:26.666]  It's a different thing to have your hands in the guts doing the emergency surgery with how big this government is in bureaucracy, the biggest thing in the world.
[00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:34.283]  But believe me, Trump is in there, he is moving to get it done, and he is the outsider.
[00:26:34.323 --> 00:26:35.464]  He's the consummate outsider.
[00:26:35.824 --> 00:26:37.885]  They hit him with everything they had and it failed.
[00:26:39.767 --> 00:26:41.268]  Every lie, every fake poll.
[00:26:41.708 --> 00:26:53.056]  And the big win is, the establishment is totally discredited, it's a huge joke, and the only way Trump loses is by being gracious and giving quarter.
[00:26:54.810 --> 00:27:00.314]  And if folks don't know about fencing or war, they say before a battle, no quarter taken, no quarter given.
[00:27:00.795 --> 00:27:02.076]  A white flag means you're giving up.
[00:27:02.396 --> 00:27:07.200]  If an army's running black flags, from the beginning of a fight, it means we're not giving up.
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:12.004]  If there's a skull on a flag, pirates didn't invent this, by the way, folks, it means we're going to kill you.
[00:27:12.584 --> 00:27:14.225]  We don't just take prisoners, we're going to kill you.
[00:27:14.486 --> 00:27:17.288]  If blood's coming out the skull, it means we're going to torture you.
[00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:21.011]  And armies would fly those flags.
[00:27:23.697 --> 00:27:25.159]  So the black flag means no surrender.
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.222]  They're running a black flag up, folks.
[00:27:27.242 --> 00:27:28.383]  They're not surrendering.
[00:27:30.406 --> 00:27:33.070]  So, it's not we want to persecute Hillary.
[00:27:33.891 --> 00:27:34.532]  It's justice.
[00:27:34.572 --> 00:27:35.733]  He's got to keep his promises.
[00:27:36.581 --> 00:27:40.702]  They're promising him now, they'll back off, let him have his agenda, if he just is nice to them.
[00:27:41.302 --> 00:27:50.064]  Once he gets in, they're going to start up a bunch of controversies, they're going to sap out his first hundred days or so, and then he'll be pretty much a lame duck.
[00:27:50.524 --> 00:27:53.565]  They're going to start impeachment proceedings run by the Republican Party itself.
[00:27:53.645 --> 00:27:56.686]  Get ready, that's already leaked, I'm going to get to that later.
[00:27:57.146 --> 00:27:59.447]  And people finally know to listen to me, that I know what I'm talking about.
[00:27:59.787 --> 00:28:00.947]  This is the current thinking.
[00:28:04.804 --> 00:28:06.905]  Sure, reconciliation, let's all be nice.
[00:28:07.005 --> 00:28:10.467]  No one in the liberal media is saying that except Dave Chappelle.
[00:28:10.547 --> 00:28:11.187]  And he's a maverick.
[00:28:13.048 --> 00:28:17.711]  And he's always bitched about black leaders only taking money from black folks and then selling them out.
[00:28:18.251 --> 00:28:19.151]  He likes what Trump's saying.
[00:28:19.171 --> 00:28:26.115]  I mean, if you really listen to what Trump's saying, you know, I think black people should have lower taxes in predominantly black areas and tax incentives because it's not taking money from somebody else.
[00:28:26.355 --> 00:28:27.276]  It's your money, let you keep it.
[00:28:27.736 --> 00:28:28.296]  I'm all for that.
[00:28:28.856 --> 00:28:30.357]  Give folks a leg up that have been disadvantaged.
[00:28:30.977 --> 00:28:32.918]  I'm all for cutting poor people's taxes across the board.
[00:28:32.939 --> 00:28:33.739]  I don't care what color you are.
[00:28:37.622 --> 00:28:42.643]  The way you break down his main tax plan, $40,000 or less, zero federal tax.
[00:28:43.343 --> 00:28:45.444]  Zip, zero, zero, zero.
[00:28:45.844 --> 00:28:47.164]  Boy, they don't want you to hear that, do they?
[00:28:48.664 --> 00:28:51.165]  So, Trump just wanted to say thank you to the listeners.
[00:28:51.205 --> 00:28:53.145]  He said what amazing people say all over the country.
[00:28:53.725 --> 00:28:56.386]  He's just, oh my God, I can't believe the influence you've got, obviously.
[00:28:56.406 --> 00:28:58.586]  It's just amazing, and we're aware of the numbers.
[00:28:58.626 --> 00:29:00.247]  We've looked at it, it's just phenomenal.
[00:29:01.067 --> 00:29:03.667]  We talked about, yeah, he was like, what is it, 75, 80 million a week?
[00:29:03.787 --> 00:29:05.568]  We're like, yeah, something like that.
[00:29:05.608 --> 00:29:06.448]  It was a good discussion.
[00:29:06.488 --> 00:29:07.308]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[00:29:13.431 --> 00:29:16.053]  Here's to all the patriots standing up for humanity worldwide.
[00:29:16.934 --> 00:29:21.217]  Whether they be Japanese, Chinese, Russian, American, Mexican, it doesn't matter.
[00:29:21.978 --> 00:29:23.599]  We're all in this together, and I salute you.
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.601]  The truth is the globalists are dehumanizing us.
[00:29:26.462 --> 00:29:28.123]  They're jacking our food and water supply.
[00:29:28.143 --> 00:29:29.784]  They're trying to destroy the family.
[00:29:30.205 --> 00:29:31.966]  They hate it that I know their attack plan.
[00:29:32.186 --> 00:29:35.249]  They hate it I don't care what they say, and I just go with the facts.
[00:29:36.969 --> 00:29:39.311]  I operate as if they don't exist, because they don't.
[00:29:39.471 --> 00:29:41.472]  They're frauds, they're sellouts, they're traitors.
[00:29:41.792 --> 00:29:48.296]  Anthony, break down the level, because as of yesterday, it was the second biggest DDOT, Spambot attack they've ever seen.
[00:29:48.676 --> 00:29:50.698]  Now they're saying it's about to be the biggest, Anthony.
[00:29:50.718 --> 00:29:56.762]  Well, you know, let me just say, we're living in a world, we're living under a society where we can't even make our own decisions anymore about what we want to read.
[00:29:57.322 --> 00:30:03.186]  The EU government, the United States House gets to pass quietly a bill that could censor so-called fake news.
[00:30:03.206 --> 00:30:05.187]  You know, Facebook says, that's okay, we're going to put a big
[00:30:05.707 --> 00:30:06.528]  We're good to go.
[00:30:21.138 --> 00:30:25.099]  Number one, we can't even intellectually choose what we want to consume anymore, to that level.
[00:30:25.519 --> 00:30:30.920]  There is a lot of fake news out there, sure, but a lot of it's going to be opinion-based, and everyone is inherently biased one way or another.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:37.461]  But then, in a more direct attack, you go on, let's say InfoWars Life, I just went on it over here, and it's down.
[00:30:37.481 --> 00:30:38.461]  The InfoWars store is down.
[00:30:38.821 --> 00:30:41.562]  Now, you would say, well, gee, what about InfoWars?
[00:30:41.762 --> 00:30:49.623]  Well, InfoWars.com is under attack, too, but these people are smart, and they're attacking the Lifeblood InfoWars Life.com and InfoWars store,
[00:30:50.083 --> 00:30:53.346]  This is what it costs to run an operation against the New World Order.
[00:30:53.547 --> 00:30:55.809]  People say, why doesn't somebody build a media system to fight them?
[00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:57.290]  They come after you.
[00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:58.391]  They demonize you.
[00:30:58.411 --> 00:30:59.652]  But here's the deal, we're winning!
[00:30:59.993 --> 00:31:02.255]  The great news is, every time we fight back, we win.
[00:31:02.535 --> 00:31:09.222]  So flood the web with HUMET, spreading our links, spreading our articles, spreading our videos, explaining what's happening.
[00:31:09.582 --> 00:31:18.544]  As an independent group, as an independent organization, not taking money from megacorporations, not taking money from government subsidies and groups and saying, oh, well, you know, we're here for the people.
[00:31:18.624 --> 00:31:22.465]  But meanwhile, getting back to our payments, we actually need to sell stuff that is really good.
[00:31:22.485 --> 00:31:25.026]  I mean, they try and attack you over and over again, say you're crazy or whatever.
[00:31:25.386 --> 00:31:29.207]  But your millions of listeners that actually know you, they say, well, hey, you know, we like him.
[00:31:29.427 --> 00:31:30.367]  So what else are they going to do?
[00:31:30.407 --> 00:31:32.188]  They're going to try and cut down your funding arm.
[00:31:32.208 --> 00:31:34.888]  They're going to try and stop you any way they possibly can.
[00:31:35.268 --> 00:31:36.829]  What are control freaks afraid of?
[00:31:37.489 --> 00:31:41.971]  They're afraid of losing control of their little fake perceived paradigm that they have control under.
[00:31:42.331 --> 00:31:43.652]  And they hate independent groups.
[00:31:43.692 --> 00:31:44.812]  They hate independent media.
[00:31:45.032 --> 00:31:49.334]  They hate anything that doesn't follow the chippering mouthpiece of the establishment system.
[00:31:49.554 --> 00:31:52.996]  They're desperately afraid of people like you because there's actually no control.
[00:31:53.436 --> 00:31:55.417]  There's no control through your back end.
[00:31:55.437 --> 00:31:56.977]  They don't come in here and tell you what to say.
[00:31:57.577 --> 00:32:05.801]  So, kind of like a loose cannon that could actually fire, you know, proverbially and intellectually at the target very, very frequently and just blasting things off.
[00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:19.362]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:32:19.443 --> 00:32:27.514]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:27.834 --> 00:32:32.536]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:32:32.696 --> 00:32:39.379]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:39.499 --> 00:32:46.583]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:32:46.683 --> 00:32:53.526]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:32:53.686 --> 00:32:58.047]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:32:58.167 --> 00:33:01.428]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:33:01.568 --> 00:33:07.709]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:33:07.869 --> 00:33:10.109]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:17.811]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:46.735 --> 00:33:51.518]  You can't always get what you want.
[00:33:53.527 --> 00:33:54.407]  That's pretty funny.
[00:33:55.028 --> 00:34:01.530]  If you're a radio listener, we'll post... Can we get whoever's on this weekend or whoever's on today to post that video to Infowars.com?
[00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:03.430]  A video from the UK.
[00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:05.851]  Hillary can't always get what she wants.
[00:34:06.091 --> 00:34:10.053]  The dog, that dirty dog Donald Trump, steals it from her every time.
[00:34:10.493 --> 00:34:12.733]  The Russians are pulling out of the global corporate government.
[00:34:13.254 --> 00:34:14.454]  The UK is pulling out of it.
[00:34:14.714 --> 00:34:17.035]  All 25 members of the EU are trying to pull out.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.302]  Trump is trying to get us to pull out of the New World Order.
[00:34:20.322 --> 00:34:23.905]  We have huge carbon taxes and open borders and everything else.
[00:34:23.985 --> 00:34:26.246]  It's a very, very important time to be alive.
[00:34:27.948 --> 00:34:34.033]  And we're attempting to restore the real American establishment that is due process, a Bill of Rights, a Constitution.
[00:34:34.793 --> 00:34:37.155]  Free speech, not political correctness.
[00:34:38.756 --> 00:34:43.800]  We're not supposed to have an establishment in this country, you see, because the establishment globally is the Fortune 500.
[00:34:45.202 --> 00:34:50.927]  And they're all lockstep to take your guns and shut down your company or your business to consolidate control.
[00:34:52.108 --> 00:34:56.612]  That's why Donald Trump, myself, and others are opposing them.
[00:34:57.773 --> 00:34:58.634]  Now let's continue.
[00:34:58.674 --> 00:35:01.676]  Donald Trump comes out and says, oh, TPP's dead.
[00:35:01.716 --> 00:35:02.377]  They admit that.
[00:35:03.712 --> 00:35:05.574]  One of the biggest global government moves in history.
[00:35:05.914 --> 00:35:08.036]  Makes Napsin get pale in comparison.
[00:35:08.397 --> 00:35:10.199]  Trump reportedly looking for a way to pull U.S.
[00:35:10.279 --> 00:35:11.140]  out of a climate agreement.
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:12.201]  Fox News.
[00:35:12.321 --> 00:35:14.944]  President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly looking for ways for the U.S.
[00:35:14.964 --> 00:35:19.568]  to back out of the landmark climate pact, which would defy an agreement to cut carbon emissions across the globe.
[00:35:19.909 --> 00:35:20.990]  Defy an agreement!
[00:35:22.892 --> 00:35:24.133]  They say Fox is right-wing.
[00:35:24.153 --> 00:35:25.474]  How about nationalistic?
[00:35:25.514 --> 00:35:25.675]  No.
[00:35:26.883 --> 00:35:35.866]  Obama defied Congress and signed on to that outside of law, then ordered the EPA to follow it, and they shut down more than half our power plants that were totally clean.
[00:35:36.606 --> 00:35:40.868]  How do we compete when China has energy three times cheaper than ours and builds coal plants every week?
[00:35:43.289 --> 00:35:44.709]  That's why they all moved to Mexico, folks.
[00:35:44.729 --> 00:35:46.910]  They moved the coal plants down there and built the factories there.
[00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:47.690]  It's crazy.
[00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:49.170]  It's crazy.
[00:35:50.011 --> 00:35:50.591]  But don't worry.
[00:35:51.051 --> 00:35:53.392]  Kerry says you have to push ahead on climate pact before Turkey.
[00:35:54.898 --> 00:35:55.819]  Another sign-on to it.
[00:35:55.919 --> 00:35:56.139]  U.S.
[00:35:56.159 --> 00:35:59.181]  to push ahead of climate pact before Trump takes over.
[00:35:59.201 --> 00:36:02.403]  They're trying to get a bunch of other countries to sign on, like New Zealand and others, to get it done.
[00:36:04.885 --> 00:36:05.566]  So there you go.
[00:36:05.726 --> 00:36:07.127]  Now, let's look at some of the other news here.
[00:36:07.407 --> 00:36:10.809]  Analysts say Trump stocks rally could persist.
[00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:19.476]  Yeah, they tried to plunge it the first day, but it still picked back up with the stock market ground analysts and traders chanting, lock her up!
[00:36:19.956 --> 00:36:20.717]  Lock her up!
[00:36:21.445 --> 00:36:34.974]  Because it's the big mega banks and brokerage firms that are shutting down all the rest of Wall Street and rigging it with fractional systems and currency fixing and other price fixing, with interest rate fixing.
[00:36:35.014 --> 00:36:36.355]  It's all come out.
[00:36:36.395 --> 00:36:38.236]  The LIBOR scandal, it's all rigged.
[00:36:38.897 --> 00:36:43.020]  And most of our real diverse stock market systems that built the country have been shut down.
[00:36:43.902 --> 00:36:54.326]  And you have the super high frequency trading systems run by Goldman Sachs that are literally consolidating power with a little guy, the little gal can't win anymore and they want that to change as well.
[00:36:54.926 --> 00:36:55.386]  And guess what?
[00:36:55.446 --> 00:36:57.887]  Trump is on the side of that.
[00:36:58.427 --> 00:37:02.789]  But before I get to all the other huge news, I want to get to some more of these clips.
[00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:09.231]  We have Sidney Blumenthal says right wing FBI agents took down Hillary in coup d'etat.
[00:37:09.432 --> 00:37:10.232]  Is that really true?
[00:37:11.789 --> 00:37:18.651]  I'll give you my honest analysis of that in a moment, but first, we've got to play this because there's different compilations.
[00:37:18.671 --> 00:37:24.793]  I played several this week, earlier this week, but here's a new one I saw on Infowars.com earlier today.
[00:37:25.573 --> 00:37:30.434]  When people laughed at the idea of Trump actually being elected president compilation.
[00:37:30.454 --> 00:37:32.035]  Now before I air this, I want to point something out.
[00:37:35.612 --> 00:37:38.794]  And I even said this myself, and I don't say that to brag.
[00:37:38.834 --> 00:37:41.557]  It's so people understand, I know how these people work.
[00:37:41.597 --> 00:37:42.397]  I've studied history.
[00:37:43.098 --> 00:37:44.799]  I've studied this establishment.
[00:37:47.101 --> 00:37:49.002]  And they really think they're better than you.
[00:37:49.963 --> 00:37:51.004]  Pride goes before a fall.
[00:37:51.664 --> 00:37:53.806]  And they really give these echo chambers of yes-men.
[00:37:57.549 --> 00:38:01.452]  And Hillary, in these emails, was telling her own party.
[00:38:03.717 --> 00:38:05.218]  Don't attack Trump too much.
[00:38:05.458 --> 00:38:08.499]  Let's let him get in the lead with these other Republicans.
[00:38:08.559 --> 00:38:09.540]  He's such a clown.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.401]  He's going to be easier to beat.
[00:38:13.001 --> 00:38:15.363]  And we'll be able to say he's racist, wanting a border wall.
[00:38:15.883 --> 00:38:16.543]  Let him go.
[00:38:17.944 --> 00:38:19.084]  Plus, they were all getting ratings.
[00:38:19.925 --> 00:38:21.746]  I remember at the time saying they think they can beat him.
[00:38:21.766 --> 00:38:22.406]  They don't get it.
[00:38:23.146 --> 00:38:24.827]  Being radical is what's popular.
[00:38:25.187 --> 00:38:26.988]  They're playing by old playbooks.
[00:38:27.008 --> 00:38:30.670]  We were all bullied into political correctness and scared and doing what we were told.
[00:38:32.975 --> 00:38:37.137]  Sure enough, they panicked when it was clear he was going to get the nomination.
[00:38:37.177 --> 00:38:39.778]  So they started saying, oh, you don't get the nomination now.
[00:38:40.098 --> 00:38:41.378]  That backfired even more.
[00:38:41.458 --> 00:38:48.121]  And the critical game changer was DrudgeReport.com and InfoWars to a secondary extent.
[00:38:48.141 --> 00:39:01.426]  But let's just, it's not about the credit, but the history needs to know with those headlines, another voterless victory for Ted Cruz, another voterless victory for Hillary, though it didn't stop Hillary from stealing it.
[00:39:02.588 --> 00:39:10.914]  The number one website in the world, with a 50 to 60 to 70 million people or more a day, seeing that went, yeah, that's not right.
[00:39:11.755 --> 00:39:24.744]  They would have the whole mainstream media say it was okay, but just a small voice in the wilderness, compared to all the rest of the media together, the truth coming out, they couldn't stand against it.
[00:39:25.925 --> 00:39:26.786]  And they're all discredited.
[00:39:27.927 --> 00:39:30.609]  So we should celebrate that, but if Trump doesn't press it,
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:35.401]  And does it continue to point out that they're the traitors we're trying to get rid of?
[00:39:35.421 --> 00:39:36.662]  They're the swamp we're trying to drain.
[00:39:37.062 --> 00:39:50.085]  They will only bite him in the ass because they understand fundamentally, at every level, that what he represents is the end of their good old boys club, where they don't have to produce anything, they just gotta stay in control.
[00:39:50.386 --> 00:39:51.606]  So here's the victory video.
[00:39:52.206 --> 00:39:55.647]  People laughed at the idea of Trump actually being elected president.
[00:39:55.867 --> 00:39:58.248]  This was their own delusion.
[00:39:58.288 --> 00:39:58.648]  Here it is.
[00:39:59.246 --> 00:40:03.867]  Donald Trump, just last week, he confirmed to the National Review that he is again considering a run in 2016.
[00:40:03.947 --> 00:40:04.127]  Do it.
[00:40:04.167 --> 00:40:04.507]  Do it.
[00:40:04.567 --> 00:40:05.127]  Look at me.
[00:40:05.247 --> 00:40:05.627]  Do it.
[00:40:05.667 --> 00:40:20.470]  I will personally write you a campaign check now, on behalf of this country, which does not want you to be president, but which badly wants you to run.
[00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:27.311]  Donald Trump has been saying that he will run for president as a Republican, which is surprising, since I just assumed he was running as a joke.
[00:40:29.254 --> 00:40:31.255]  Is that people think that Donald Trump is a clown?
[00:40:31.635 --> 00:40:33.256]  Donald Trump is a clown.
[00:40:33.276 --> 00:40:38.859]  I mean, does anybody seriously think that Donald Trump is serious about running for president?
[00:40:38.939 --> 00:40:42.440]  You know, he's a clown.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.481]  So manly.
[00:40:43.621 --> 00:40:47.262]  Which Republican candidate has the best chance of winning the general election?
[00:40:48.263 --> 00:40:50.824]  Of the declared ones right now, Donald Trump.
[00:40:58.110 --> 00:40:58.890]  They're all followers.
[00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:00.111]  They're followers, we're leaders.
[00:41:00.131 --> 00:41:00.791]  How's it feel, folks?
[00:41:00.811 --> 00:41:01.071]  Yep, 44, he's 45.
[00:41:18.078 --> 00:41:20.302]  So basically this is the beginning of the end for Trump.
[00:41:20.322 --> 00:41:21.363]  The beginning of the end.
[00:41:21.403 --> 00:41:22.164]  Beginning of the end.
[00:41:22.184 --> 00:41:25.549]  This is probably starting of the beginning of the end for Donald Trump.
[00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:29.315]  Donald, you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency.
[00:41:29.776 --> 00:41:33.682]  The strongest person usually isn't the loudest one in the room.
[00:41:34.382 --> 00:41:36.723]  So right now, we have Hillary's about 75% favorite.
[00:41:36.743 --> 00:41:38.424]  We have different versions.
[00:41:38.444 --> 00:41:41.365]  The poll has Hillary Clinton up by double digits.
[00:41:41.485 --> 00:41:44.186]  Nationally, 12 points, 50 to 38 in the four-way race.
[00:41:44.766 --> 00:41:45.846]  Clinton leading in Florida.
[00:41:45.866 --> 00:41:47.167]  Clinton leading in North Carolina.
[00:41:47.227 --> 00:41:48.267]  Clinton leading in Ohio.
[00:41:48.287 --> 00:41:49.788]  Clinton leading in Nevada.
[00:41:49.908 --> 00:41:51.188]  I could go on and on and on.
[00:41:52.749 --> 00:41:55.069]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president.
[00:41:55.089 --> 00:41:56.110]  He'll go on and online, Dan.
[00:41:56.810 --> 00:42:04.496]  And so, right now, Mr. Trump, to answer your call for political honesty, I just want to say... You're not going to be president, alright?
[00:42:04.516 --> 00:42:05.777]  It's been fun!
[00:42:05.837 --> 00:42:08.559]  It's been great!
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.942]  You overthrew them!
[00:42:11.982 --> 00:42:12.102]  What?
[00:42:12.122 --> 00:42:12.902]  You overthrew them!
[00:42:12.942 --> 00:42:13.023]  What?
[00:42:13.043 --> 00:42:14.143]  You broke the mind control!
[00:42:14.223 --> 00:42:15.144]  Come on, buddy!
[00:42:15.164 --> 00:42:15.965]  You broke the trance!
[00:42:16.005 --> 00:42:19.447]  ...major projection right now, Donald Trump will take Ohio.
[00:42:19.487 --> 00:42:20.728]  That's the projection.
[00:42:20.748 --> 00:42:24.311]  Donald Trump will carry the state of Florida!
[00:42:24.551 --> 00:42:25.412]  Wait, Donald Trump...
[00:42:26.262 --> 00:42:28.044]  He's so evil.
[00:42:28.244 --> 00:42:32.389]  He doesn't want to blow up Russia.
[00:42:32.489 --> 00:42:35.612]  Oh, Russia's done nothing to us.
[00:42:36.012 --> 00:42:37.374]  I've seen as weak.
[00:42:37.394 --> 00:42:39.056]  The globe has turned to war.
[00:42:39.116 --> 00:42:39.496]  Winning.
[00:42:39.676 --> 00:42:39.957]  Winning.
[00:42:40.017 --> 00:42:40.437]  Winning.
[00:42:46.563 --> 00:42:49.726]  Sorry to keep you waiting, complicated business.
[00:42:49.806 --> 00:42:53.550]  A lot of people have laughed at me over the years.
[00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:56.473]  Now they're not laughing so much, I'll tell you.
[00:43:05.501 --> 00:43:06.021]  We'll be back.
[00:43:06.041 --> 00:43:06.442]  Stay with us.
[00:43:06.482 --> 00:43:07.102]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:43:07.142 --> 00:43:08.163]  This is the InfoWar.
[00:43:08.863 --> 00:43:10.685]  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
[00:43:10.785 --> 00:43:12.506]  That all men are created equal.
[00:43:12.706 --> 00:43:16.209]  That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights.
[00:43:16.409 --> 00:43:19.511]  That among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:43:19.831 --> 00:43:26.636]  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[00:43:26.876 --> 00:43:33.861]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it.
[00:43:34.464 --> 00:43:36.037]  ...and institute new government.
[00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.181]  Independence isn't a day.
[00:43:39.462 --> 00:43:40.242]  It's a mindset.
[00:43:40.502 --> 00:43:43.164]  An attitude that says, I will not be your dependent.
[00:43:43.264 --> 00:43:44.585]  I will not be your slave.
[00:43:44.886 --> 00:43:50.410]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:55.214]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave.
[00:43:55.914 --> 00:43:57.355]  Slaves are never safe.
[00:43:57.796 --> 00:44:00.097]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[00:44:00.798 --> 00:44:01.478]  Guard your liberty.
[00:44:01.879 --> 00:44:04.641]  Regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[00:44:05.181 --> 00:44:07.143]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:44:08.556 --> 00:44:16.682]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:44:17.662 --> 00:44:26.488]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption, and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:44:26.869 --> 00:44:30.751]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:44:30.831 --> 00:44:33.813]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:44:33.833 --> 00:44:35.334]  We now have George Soros
[00:44:36.415 --> 00:44:37.176]  As a goblin.
[00:44:37.836 --> 00:44:41.499]  On the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters.
[00:44:41.839 --> 00:44:42.500]  No Soros.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:43.640]  Him as a goblin.
[00:44:44.381 --> 00:44:48.744]  It says, Deport Soros on the bottom, and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[00:44:50.986 --> 00:44:54.208]  So, it is a limited edition, Deport Soros on the back.
[00:44:54.708 --> 00:44:55.889]  Hillary for President on the front.
[00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:58.071]  Right hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[00:44:58.431 --> 00:44:59.012]  It's powerful.
[00:44:59.032 --> 00:45:00.072]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.
[00:45:00.332 --> 00:45:02.114]  InfoWarsStore.com, or call 888-253-3139.

[00:47:12.085 --> 00:47:16.186]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:16.726 --> 00:47:18.066]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:19.187 --> 00:47:27.489]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:47:29.329 --> 00:47:32.710]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:35.291]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.582]  Alright, I do want to open the phones up some in the next hour or so.
[00:47:39.602 --> 00:47:43.064]  At the very end of this segment, I'm going to open the phones up and give that toll-free number out.
[00:47:43.424 --> 00:47:47.487]  But before I go there, I want to play this Dave Chappelle clip against some other news.
[00:47:48.848 --> 00:47:54.892]  But just pulling back from this, if I got a call from President Barack Obama, it would mean nothing to me.
[00:47:55.833 --> 00:47:57.654]  I would just say, please stop selling our country out.
[00:47:57.694 --> 00:48:01.997]  It's not fair to have higher taxes on us than China has on their industries.
[00:48:02.097 --> 00:48:02.857]  Why are you doing this?
[00:48:04.178 --> 00:48:06.260]  Power means nothing to me if it's not doing good.
[00:48:07.393 --> 00:48:09.575]  I mean, I've had Obama talk about me.
[00:48:09.616 --> 00:48:11.317]  I've had Hillary talk about me and attack me.
[00:48:11.598 --> 00:48:12.358]  It means nothing.
[00:48:12.418 --> 00:48:13.359]  I've been on Nightline.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.481]  I've been in movies.
[00:48:14.521 --> 00:48:15.522]  I've been on HBO.
[00:48:16.843 --> 00:48:18.165]  I've been at the A-list parties.
[00:48:18.925 --> 00:48:20.107]  I don't want to sell it to the system.
[00:48:20.167 --> 00:48:23.410]  I don't want to go to the inauguration and sit around people in tuxedos and hang around with Trump.
[00:48:24.531 --> 00:48:25.793]  I want to change the world.
[00:48:25.933 --> 00:48:27.054]  I want to build a better planet.
[00:48:27.114 --> 00:48:29.056]  I want to have a better future.
[00:48:29.096 --> 00:48:29.777]  That's what I'm into.
[00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:38.472]  But you do have to pinch yourself like some parallel universe when the South delivered a Yankee into the White House.
[00:48:38.492 --> 00:48:39.033]  It's beautiful.
[00:48:40.553 --> 00:48:41.494]  Whole South went for him.
[00:48:42.214 --> 00:48:43.334]  New York, his own state.
[00:48:45.055 --> 00:48:47.596]  They'd have to steal that because there's almost no Republicans even on the ballot.
[00:48:47.936 --> 00:48:50.257]  So there's not even a Republican Party in most counties, basically.
[00:48:51.817 --> 00:48:53.838]  So it's all Democrats.
[00:48:53.858 --> 00:48:54.978]  So he lost his own state.
[00:48:56.779 --> 00:48:59.260]  He stole five other states, that's clear, but he still won.
[00:49:00.327 --> 00:49:00.907]  It's beautiful.
[00:49:01.768 --> 00:49:04.430]  All this demonization of the North and the South is all made up crap.
[00:49:06.571 --> 00:49:12.135]  And it's like some parallel universe that we were in, we finally broke it back into the real universe.
[00:49:13.856 --> 00:49:15.557]  I mean, Obama doubled black unemployment.
[00:49:15.577 --> 00:49:22.302]  He didn't do anything for those communities, except spew racism to give people a wound instead of a job.
[00:49:24.138 --> 00:49:31.681]  That's what I'm tired of is, ladies and gentlemen, I covered the demographics in 2008, I covered the demographics in 2012, so did you.
[00:49:31.721 --> 00:49:32.201]  You saw it.
[00:49:32.842 --> 00:49:41.125]  A record number of white people, more than voted for Ronald Reagan, this is more people, but still, a record number voted
[00:49:43.342 --> 00:49:51.587]  A record number of Republicans voted for Barack Obama because they were so sick of George W. Bush and the wars and the spying and the stuttering and the lying.
[00:49:52.528 --> 00:49:55.830]  And I mean, with George W., it was like we had a retarded monkey in the White House.
[00:49:57.371 --> 00:50:05.436]  And so Americans are like, yeah, sure, this guy says he didn't want our guns, wants to cut taxes, wants to do all this great stuff, sure, put him in, he's an articulate, good-looking guy.
[00:50:06.436 --> 00:50:08.798]  In comes Obama, screws us up one side and down the other.
[00:50:09.218 --> 00:50:10.299]  So I came up with this saying.
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:12.220]  I tweeted it.
[00:50:13.615 --> 00:50:14.976]  Yesterday, we should tweet it again.
[00:50:17.417 --> 00:50:21.038]  We voted for Obama because we wanted to prove we weren't racists.
[00:50:22.759 --> 00:50:24.920]  We voted for Trump to prove we weren't stupid.
[00:50:26.561 --> 00:50:30.603]  And I didn't vote for Obama, but I was neutral.
[00:50:31.323 --> 00:50:35.565]  I was so sick of the Republican establishment, John McCain is as bad, maybe worse, totally out of his mind.
[00:50:36.246 --> 00:50:39.707]  In fact, more warmonger than Obama, so maybe that was the right choice, as bad as it was.
[00:50:40.147 --> 00:50:41.028]  Obama was a wake-up call.
[00:50:41.755 --> 00:50:49.320]  Man, I was all for Romney, even though I didn't completely like him, because... I mean, Obama had done so much bad in four years.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.221]  I mean, hurt poor people so damn bad.
[00:50:53.703 --> 00:50:59.947]  One thing I harped on every day was, you shut down 500 plants this first administration, another 500, 600 the second.
[00:51:00.908 --> 00:51:02.269]  That was almost half our plants.
[00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:06.972]  Everything we've got's moving to Mexico, folks, because they're building brand new, dirty-running plants.
[00:51:07.553 --> 00:51:10.935]  One-tenth the price of ours, and the electricity's cheaper than dirt.
[00:51:12.725 --> 00:51:16.426]  So you can run a factory three, four times cheaper in Mexico just on electricity.
[00:51:16.446 --> 00:51:18.287]  That's the number one cost in a factory.
[00:51:19.287 --> 00:51:21.788]  It's above labor in a manufacturing plant generally.
[00:51:22.548 --> 00:51:23.148]  Where are you going to go?
[00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:29.050]  America has like bowling balls tied to its legs playing a football game.
[00:51:29.351 --> 00:51:29.911]  It's not right!
[00:51:31.991 --> 00:51:36.433]  Trump gets that and that's why all these special interests are so pissed because they sold us out.
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:50.231]  Now Dave Chappelle tells some historical stories, and I'm a pretty big historian, and the Abraham Lincoln story's true, and I'm not defending Roosevelt, but that's a story that's been disproven.
[00:51:50.251 --> 00:51:51.732]  He did not call the person an n-word.
[00:51:52.073 --> 00:51:56.597]  But the point is, is that, yes, everything in America was class-run.
[00:51:56.917 --> 00:51:58.559]  Not as much as Europe, but still class-run.
[00:51:58.579 --> 00:51:59.260]  We were a little bit better.
[00:52:00.333 --> 00:52:06.278]  But he makes the point that he goes to the White House, it's all black people there for this party, and everybody's saying Trump can't do it, Trump can't do it.
[00:52:06.698 --> 00:52:09.040]  The sense of what you get is, it's this elitism.
[00:52:09.081 --> 00:52:14.805]  What, a multi-billionaire white guy suddenly isn't qualified and Obama's all arrogant and says you can't do it?
[00:52:14.825 --> 00:52:16.547]  So they say the black man can't be president.
[00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:19.469]  Obama's a smart guy.
[00:52:19.489 --> 00:52:20.791]  If he wasn't a globalist, he'd be great.
[00:52:20.851 --> 00:52:25.895]  See, it's not the color of their skin, it's who they stand up for, who they serve.
[00:52:25.935 --> 00:52:27.997]  Like Bob Dylan says, you gotta serve someone.
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:35.123]  When I stand up for nationalism, that'll teach other countries to stand up for nationalism.
[00:52:35.663 --> 00:52:37.565]  So the multinationals just don't run over the top of us.
[00:52:41.408 --> 00:52:42.109]  But it is surreal.
[00:52:42.129 --> 00:52:44.911]  You want to know how real Donald Trump is?
[00:52:47.933 --> 00:52:51.516]  I could have gotten Donald Trump back on the show since he first came on, but I knew they were going to use it.
[00:52:51.977 --> 00:52:56.460]  I wasn't 100% sure that my association with him was good overall, and I knew it was with the grassroots.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.761]  Everything was bonafide.
[00:52:57.781 --> 00:52:59.603]  We knew the numbers.
[00:53:00.913 --> 00:53:02.855]  But I just didn't push, even though I could have got him on.
[00:53:02.975 --> 00:53:05.357]  We talked some on the phone, here and there.
[00:53:06.899 --> 00:53:07.740]  Real conversations.
[00:53:10.723 --> 00:53:16.068]  And then, boom, I see Trump Tower calling, Friday, at a lengthy conversation.
[00:53:16.088 --> 00:53:18.390]  He says, you're number 61, Alex, on my list.
[00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:22.194]  Just talked to the Queen of England, and then this person, and now you.
[00:53:23.519 --> 00:53:25.620]  He goes, yeah, well you're a little busy sir, maybe we should talk later.
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:28.381]  He goes, well, I understand that, but just keep doing what you're doing.
[00:53:28.421 --> 00:53:31.363]  And those other things were said, but I appreciate you and your audience.
[00:53:31.403 --> 00:53:32.503]  It's amazing what you're doing.
[00:53:32.563 --> 00:53:36.325]  And good God, it's incredible the influence you, you know, talk like that.
[00:53:39.947 --> 00:53:46.530]  But the point is, is that I wouldn't have cared if it was a Barack Obama or a George Bush or a Bill Clinton.
[00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:47.810]  I wouldn't even probably take that call.
[00:53:48.531 --> 00:53:51.172]  I mean, I had the governor when he was the president elect trying to get me to
[00:53:52.921 --> 00:53:55.523]  Say nice things about him and he wanted to have me come over to the governor's mansion.
[00:53:55.543 --> 00:54:01.787]  I mean, they had the state police come over and then later federal marshals saying, look, he wants to be nice to you.
[00:54:02.147 --> 00:54:02.588]  He likes you.
[00:54:04.349 --> 00:54:07.151]  But I guess that Bush collected talk shows like he collected baseball cards.
[00:54:07.171 --> 00:54:07.671]  It didn't happen.
[00:54:08.291 --> 00:54:08.612]  You know what?
[00:54:08.632 --> 00:54:09.572]  I'm a baseball card.
[00:54:09.652 --> 00:54:13.695]  I'm in the pocket of Donald Trump as long as he delivers.
[00:54:14.315 --> 00:54:15.096]  He delivers half.
[00:54:15.536 --> 00:54:16.537]  It's earth changing.
[00:54:18.393 --> 00:54:19.633]  I mean, he wants the whole enchilada.
[00:54:19.653 --> 00:54:20.914]  He is in an uphill battle, folks.
[00:54:20.934 --> 00:54:21.734]  We better understand that.
[00:54:22.134 --> 00:54:25.154]  With everything against him, we only have a tenuous beachhead right now.
[00:54:26.075 --> 00:54:27.515]  And he's already delivering on so many fronts.
[00:54:28.255 --> 00:54:39.357]  And if he thinks appointing some big banker is the Treasury person, because they have the connections, as long as they do his will and our will, it's like World War II.
[00:54:39.417 --> 00:54:41.698]  If Nazis were defecting over to our side, did we just kick them out?
[00:54:41.718 --> 00:54:42.918]  No, we had to have them to win the war.
[00:54:45.579 --> 00:54:46.939]  Same thing, you know, with our Revolutionary War.
[00:54:50.444 --> 00:54:53.245]  I will always be honest in the final equation about what I see happening.
[00:54:53.265 --> 00:55:09.388]  It's not about some relationship or being starstruck by Trump, but it's good to finally be enchanted again a little bit and to find something exciting because nothing's exciting to me except my kids having a fun time out on the lake or sunset or barbecuing or hiking or loving God and being a good man.
[00:55:10.068 --> 00:55:12.208]  Power means nothing to me unless it's doing good for people.
[00:55:12.688 --> 00:55:16.769]  So know this, I believe Trump's, my gut tells me he's for real, but also
[00:55:17.549 --> 00:55:23.713]  Now, before I go, I do want to say one thing, and this is not a joke, but I think it's important that I say this, because they're marching up the street right now as we speak.
[00:55:39.855 --> 00:55:42.716]  A few weeks ago, I went to the White House for a party.
[00:55:42.856 --> 00:55:45.157]  It was the first time I'd been there in many years.
[00:55:45.678 --> 00:55:46.738]  This is Saturday Night Live.
[00:55:46.758 --> 00:55:47.498]  We're analyzing it.
[00:55:47.538 --> 00:55:48.559]  And it was very exciting.
[00:55:49.359 --> 00:55:51.120]  And BET had sponsored the party.
[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:54.041]  So everyone there was black.
[00:55:56.603 --> 00:55:57.503]  And it was beautiful.
[00:55:57.763 --> 00:55:58.643]  I walked through the gates.
[00:55:58.824 --> 00:56:06.567]  You know, I'm from Washington, so I saw the bus stop, or the corner where the bus stop used to be, where I used to catch the bus to school and dream about nights like tonight.
[00:56:07.247 --> 00:56:08.668]  It was a really, really beautiful night.
[00:56:09.594 --> 00:56:12.276]  And at the end of the night, everyone went into the West Wing of the White House.
[00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:14.277]  And there was a huge party.
[00:56:15.218 --> 00:56:18.340]  And everybody in there was black, except for Brad the Koopa, for some reason.
[00:56:24.865 --> 00:56:28.988]  And on the walls were pictures of all the presidents of the past.
[00:56:30.169 --> 00:56:37.174]  Now, I'm not sure if this is true, but to my knowledge, the first black person that was officially invited to the White House was Frederick Douglass.
[00:56:37.634 --> 00:56:38.975]  They stopped him at the gates.
[00:56:40.018 --> 00:56:44.860]  Abraham Lincoln had to walk out himself and escort Frederick Douglass into the White House.
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:48.922]  And it didn't happen again, as far as I know, until Roosevelt was president.
[00:56:49.962 --> 00:56:58.586]  When Roosevelt was president, he had a black guy over and got so much flack from the media that he literally said, I will never have a nigger in this house again.
[00:57:00.126 --> 00:57:04.528]  I thought about that and I looked at that room and I saw all those black faces in Bradley.
[00:57:05.249 --> 00:57:05.789]  And I saw
[00:57:09.514 --> 00:57:11.615]  And I saw how happy everybody was.
[00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:14.877]  These people had been historically disenfranchised.
[00:57:15.457 --> 00:57:16.818]  And it made me feel hopeful.
[00:57:17.478 --> 00:57:19.419]  And it made me feel proud of being American.
[00:57:19.819 --> 00:57:23.301]  And it made me very happy about the prospects of our country.
[00:57:23.941 --> 00:57:28.364]  So, in that spirit, I'm wishing Donald Trump luck.
[00:57:29.504 --> 00:57:31.085]  And I'm going to give him a chance.
[00:57:32.506 --> 00:57:38.409]  And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one too.
[00:57:39.421 --> 00:57:40.042]  Thank you very much.
[00:57:40.062 --> 00:57:40.663]  Well, don't worry.
[00:57:40.843 --> 00:57:42.465]  He's not out to get you like the Globalist are.
[00:57:42.485 --> 00:57:44.427]  He's not going to build more abortuaries in your neighborhood.
[00:57:45.008 --> 00:57:50.234]  So that's a very, very exciting little piece there because it shows that folks at a deep down level understand what's happening here.
[00:57:50.254 --> 00:57:52.517]  But we have to get behind Trump so he can deliver that.
[00:57:53.098 --> 00:57:54.539]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[00:57:54.559 --> 00:57:58.264]  We have free shipping running store-wide at instantaliumforestore.com.
[00:57:59.516 --> 00:58:00.897]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:58:00.957 --> 00:58:02.038]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:58:02.278 --> 00:58:03.199]  Why is this so good?
[00:58:03.499 --> 00:58:08.743]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:58:08.823 --> 00:58:22.373]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:58:22.433 --> 00:58:23.814]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:58:24.574 --> 00:58:26.135]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:58:26.235 --> 00:58:28.738]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:58:28.818 --> 00:58:30.079]  These are all parasites.
[00:58:30.119 --> 00:58:31.220]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:32.280]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:58:32.581 --> 00:58:36.924]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:58:37.124 --> 00:58:40.287]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:58:40.367 --> 00:58:43.451]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:58:43.471 --> 00:58:44.492]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:58:44.532 --> 00:58:46.415]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:46.475 --> 00:58:47.496]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:58:47.516 --> 00:58:49.598]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:58:50.219 --> 00:58:53.263]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:53.523 --> 00:58:55.406]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:58:55.786 --> 00:58:57.749]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:58:59.008 --> 00:59:04.271]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse, minor words, and his was action.
[00:59:04.852 --> 00:59:06.373]  His was what he's done to women.
[00:59:06.433 --> 00:59:12.096]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[00:59:12.316 --> 00:59:14.618]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[00:59:14.978 --> 00:59:21.182]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight.
[00:59:21.302 --> 00:59:26.605]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[00:59:37.438 --> 00:59:40.179]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:42.480]  It's a fight for our minds.
[00:59:43.161 --> 00:59:45.081]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.

[01:00:18.933 --> 01:00:19.993]  About to give it out.
[01:00:27.125 --> 01:00:33.210]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:00:33.591 --> 01:00:35.152]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.372 --> 01:00:40.717]  Now I probably should have been covering all the news and stuff on DrugsReport.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:00:41.677 --> 01:00:46.482]  Where you've got the George Soros funded people running around burning stuff and screaming racism this, racism that.
[01:00:51.166 --> 01:00:52.507]  This is just ongoing crap.
[01:00:53.578 --> 01:01:00.743]  But that's not as important as every network channel saying it's a whitelash, it's a whitelash, it's a whitelash.
[01:01:00.803 --> 01:01:02.825]  I'm gonna go back and get the demographic numbers this week.
[01:01:02.865 --> 01:01:03.605]  I mean, I remember them.
[01:01:04.266 --> 01:01:09.089]  Record numbers of whites, record numbers of Republicans vote, a huge mandate landslide.
[01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:10.670]  Let me tell you something.
[01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:12.832]  Barack Obama didn't need to steal his first election.
[01:01:12.872 --> 01:01:14.653]  He won in a frickin' landslide.
[01:01:17.815 --> 01:01:20.077]  Because people wanted change.
[01:01:21.458 --> 01:01:22.518]  People just want change.
[01:01:23.544 --> 01:01:30.226]  I can tell you as a white person, believe me, I don't care if our president had brown skin, black skin, white skin.
[01:01:30.246 --> 01:01:31.706]  I don't care if it's a woman.
[01:01:33.126 --> 01:01:36.647]  I just want him to do economic systems that we know work.
[01:01:38.247 --> 01:01:44.629]  And it's so insulting to hear that this is because we didn't like Barack Obama because he was black.
[01:01:47.435 --> 01:01:54.239]  Now, I'll tell you, seeing them hype folks up into racial hatred and seeing a bunch of racist black people running around saying whites are bad, it gets a little old.
[01:01:54.379 --> 01:01:56.160]  I mean, it's just like, damn, you're ignorant.
[01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:03.204]  There were systems of economic degradation against basically everybody.
[01:02:03.584 --> 01:02:07.887]  Classism was a system of control, and the lowest area of that class was being a black slave.
[01:02:07.907 --> 01:02:08.887]  I get it, and it was wrong.
[01:02:09.928 --> 01:02:14.891]  But to sit there and project class warfare onto anybody that isn't black,
[01:02:17.179 --> 01:02:20.660]  Like they did something to you is a fundamental insult.
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:22.540]  And I'm tired of it.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.821]  And it's not racism I have, I'm sick of your ignorance.
[01:02:26.881 --> 01:02:31.402]  It's like, let me tell you something, you can be black, you can be white, you can be Hispanic, you can be an Asian woman.
[01:02:33.502 --> 01:02:39.524]  I'm going down the highway, I agree with Ludacris on this, and you're in the fast lane, in my way.
[01:02:40.704 --> 01:02:41.544]  You see them headlights?
[01:02:41.564 --> 01:02:42.925]  You see me knock them curtains down?
[01:02:44.285 --> 01:02:44.925]  Get out of the way.
[01:02:46.752 --> 01:02:48.572]  You should be smart enough to get the hell out of my way.
[01:02:51.153 --> 01:02:52.113]  Everybody likes success.
[01:02:52.153 --> 01:02:53.813]  I don't care what color you are or where you came from.
[01:02:54.373 --> 01:02:58.354]  You're cool, you're smart, you got success, you got... I don't give a damn.
[01:02:59.414 --> 01:03:14.517]  And I'm tired of you insulting who I am, telling me that I got a problem with you because of what damn color you are, when all that is is some program, more classism, that we can't ever seem to get rid of, based on just where you're from, what you look like, instead of what you do.
[01:03:17.025 --> 01:03:20.506]  Now voters who heavily supported Obama switched over to Trump.
[01:03:20.546 --> 01:03:21.226]  Wow, I didn't even see that.
[01:03:21.266 --> 01:03:22.607]  I didn't believe the Washington Post told the truth.
[01:03:22.647 --> 01:03:24.307]  I guess now the new regime is in.
[01:03:24.327 --> 01:03:26.348]  You know, that's one thing I was thinking about.
[01:03:27.528 --> 01:03:28.789]  Most of the media was under terror.
[01:03:28.829 --> 01:03:30.329]  You would get fired by the executives.
[01:03:30.509 --> 01:03:31.370]  They had such control.
[01:03:31.570 --> 01:03:32.230]  That's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:34.091]  And if you didn't, you'd get kicked out.
[01:03:34.151 --> 01:03:35.551]  So maybe so many people are finally telling the truth.
[01:03:35.771 --> 01:03:36.051]  Print that.
[01:03:36.071 --> 01:03:37.952]  I didn't even know the Washington Post told the truth there.
[01:03:38.292 --> 01:03:39.232]  That's just what the numbers showed.
[01:03:39.652 --> 01:03:41.253]  It was Obama voters that beat Hillary.
[01:03:44.224 --> 01:03:59.581]  But what panics the social engineers, you see, is that, whoa, if we get non-whites on board for libertarianism and free market, they're going to be so damn wealthy, even the laziest whites, blacks that matter are going to be better off after this.
[01:03:59.601 --> 01:04:02.664]  We're going to have so much damn prosperity that we're not going to need us anymore.
[01:04:02.684 --> 01:04:03.866]  They're not going to need welfare anymore.
[01:04:06.172 --> 01:04:08.013]  It'll be like, oh yeah, five percent's on that.
[01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:11.135]  We're trying to, you know, too bad, they're mentally ill or whatever.
[01:04:11.155 --> 01:04:13.036]  Yeah, take care of the mentally ill people, whatever.
[01:04:13.476 --> 01:04:15.117]  Oh, oh, another big one, we're going to break.
[01:04:15.137 --> 01:04:19.879]  You know, I'm going to give them the number, I'm going to come back with this.
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:25.002]  They say he's not going to deport anybody, and they say he's going to keep Obamacare.
[01:04:25.603 --> 01:04:26.283]  None of that's true.
[01:04:27.504 --> 01:04:29.985]  I spent all weekend reading what's really happening.
[01:04:32.543 --> 01:04:36.984]  He supports pre-existing conditions being covered, and children sit on insurance until they're 26.
[01:04:37.685 --> 01:04:38.485]  He said that a year ago.
[01:04:38.505 --> 01:04:40.145]  It's been on his website for a year.
[01:04:41.366 --> 01:04:42.006]  Never flip-flop.
[01:04:42.806 --> 01:04:44.847]  Never plan to have roving groups rounding folks up.
[01:04:45.107 --> 01:04:49.048]  They said if you're a felon and we catch you at a DWI or whatever, you're gonna be deported.
[01:04:49.068 --> 01:04:49.588]  That's all he said.
[01:04:50.268 --> 01:04:51.689]  You're here illegal, you're a criminal, you're gone.
[01:04:51.709 --> 01:04:52.549]  We're gonna ship your ass out here.
[01:04:53.639 --> 01:04:54.761]  Every other company does that.
[01:04:54.781 --> 01:04:59.028]  They took normal stuff, folks, and inverted it into mind control.
[01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:00.491]  Call for your number to join us.
[01:05:00.511 --> 01:05:00.831]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:05:00.851 --> 01:05:00.892]  877-789-2539.
[01:05:00.912 --> 01:05:01.132]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:05:01.152 --> 01:05:01.533]  Call now.
[01:05:09.522 --> 01:05:13.063]  Let's face it, most of us are totally addicted to our cell phones.
[01:05:13.163 --> 01:05:17.644]  But recent studies link cell phone use to major health issues, including brain cancer.
[01:05:17.945 --> 01:05:21.426]  Experts say parents and expecting mothers need to be extra careful.
[01:05:21.706 --> 01:05:25.827]  Doctors say the infant brain, even while in the womb, is especially vulnerable.
[01:05:25.967 --> 01:05:30.090]  So keep the phone away from your abdomen, especially toward the end of pregnancy.
[01:05:30.270 --> 01:05:39.896]  And for men, using a cell phone for as little as an hour a day is literally cooking your sperm, lowering sperm count levels so much that conceiving a child could be difficult.
[01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:42.678]  This is one of those times you want to keep it out of your pants.
[01:05:43.058 --> 01:05:48.462]  And for those of us who use our cell phones before bed, know that the screen light is actually disrupting your sleep rhythms.
[01:05:48.522 --> 01:05:51.024]  This causes insomnia and slows the metabolism.
[01:05:51.184 --> 01:05:52.204]  Hello, weight gain!
[01:05:52.465 --> 01:05:57.448]  Generally speaking, when cell phones are on, they're constantly emitting radio frequency radiation.
[01:05:57.568 --> 01:05:59.670]  So keep your phone in airplane mode when you can.
[01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:02.211]  Keep the phone at least two feet away from your body.
[01:06:02.451 --> 01:06:03.172]  Use headphones.
[01:06:03.372 --> 01:06:06.414]  And when you're not on your phone, keep it as far away from you as possible.
[01:06:06.694 --> 01:06:08.736]  Leigh Ann McAdoo with your InfoWars Tip of the Week.
[01:06:19.645 --> 01:06:28.151]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:28.291 --> 01:06:31.414]  We are a long way from being out of the woods, my friends.
[01:06:32.715 --> 01:06:34.356]  But let me tell you, we are fighting back.
[01:06:34.396 --> 01:06:35.437]  Humanity's on the march.
[01:06:36.177 --> 01:06:39.680]  From Russia to the UK to the United States, globalism is in decline.
[01:06:40.919 --> 01:06:57.252]  And the elite said in all their major publications, I've really beat this to death, but I'm talking to Washington Post, Financial Times of London, The Economist, New York Times, that if Hillary fell, she'd be the final domino for the new world order.
[01:06:57.272 --> 01:07:00.735]  And they had headlines Wednesday morning and Thursday morning and the two days after the election.
[01:07:01.215 --> 01:07:02.336]  World government's in trouble!
[01:07:02.576 --> 01:07:09.222]  But see, you acted in a vacuum like nobody else knew that stuff was going on.
[01:07:11.158 --> 01:07:19.422]  You acted in a vacuum where they'd be announcing world government and on C-SPAN, we'd play the clip, they'd go, but there is no world government, Mr. Jones.
[01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:20.482]  You're being anti-Semitic.
[01:07:21.583 --> 01:07:23.364]  And I'd say, I don't think Jews run the world.
[01:07:25.085 --> 01:07:28.146]  That would turn into Jerusalem Post, Alex Jones, Jews run the world.
[01:07:30.567 --> 01:07:31.688]  I don't want Obamacare.
[01:07:33.081 --> 01:07:36.665]  It says here it has death panels and it'll double prices in the first three years.
[01:07:37.525 --> 01:07:38.486]  Shut up, racist!
[01:07:38.526 --> 01:07:39.427]  You're deeply racist!
[01:07:39.607 --> 01:07:39.908]  What?
[01:07:40.749 --> 01:07:42.430]  So, it didn't make people racist.
[01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:43.732]  It just pissed everybody off.
[01:07:44.833 --> 01:07:54.082]  And it got so ridiculous that record numbers of blacks and record numbers of Hispanics in any election ever voted
[01:07:55.253 --> 01:07:56.473]  For Republicans since the 1950s.
[01:07:56.633 --> 01:08:04.915]  Because minorities weren't voting Republican then because they were for the Civil Rights Movement, then the Democrats flipped over and they ran the media because they'd been the establishment, and that was it.
[01:08:05.975 --> 01:08:07.476]  The Republicans were not the establishment.
[01:08:08.496 --> 01:08:09.576]  They were trying to change things.
[01:08:09.596 --> 01:08:10.236]  They weren't perfect.
[01:08:12.457 --> 01:08:18.978]  But since a caller, since Nico was mentioning it earlier, I'm going to take your calls here in a moment, the number is 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex...
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:31.685]  You guys brought me the article in here where it showed how voters who heavily supported Obama switched over to Trump.
[01:08:33.567 --> 01:08:38.631]  This is a November 10th article I had seen from a couple days ago, I guess on Thursday.
[01:08:38.651 --> 01:08:47.018]  And they admit that all these people that had actually given Obama the big victory went for Trump because they want an economic future.
[01:08:48.928 --> 01:08:57.677]  In all these de-industrialized areas, particularly in the north central area and the east, isn't that interesting?
[01:08:57.697 --> 01:08:58.798]  Because that's really what happened.
[01:08:59.498 --> 01:09:01.981]  These people don't care what color the president is.
[01:09:03.022 --> 01:09:07.186]  Man, it's hard to get a job and then if you're on welfare it doesn't pay the bills.
[01:09:08.147 --> 01:09:09.908]  And we're supposedly this big prosperous nation.
[01:09:09.948 --> 01:09:10.429]  What happened?
[01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:12.291]  You got sold out.
[01:09:13.962 --> 01:09:17.944]  So I was reading during the break, it's just amazing that this is actually a truthful article.
[01:09:18.464 --> 01:09:20.805]  I think my head's spinning out of the Washington Post.
[01:09:21.246 --> 01:09:25.908]  The revenge of the white working class voter and where millions of Obama supporters flip for Trump.
[01:09:26.690 --> 01:09:33.515]  So see, Town Hall says the revenge of white working voters, even the conservative side, and then where millions of Obama supporters flipped their vote.
[01:09:33.555 --> 01:09:41.021]  It wasn't white voters, it was record numbers of blacks, record numbers of Hispanics, and record numbers of former Obama voters and whites.
[01:09:41.081 --> 01:09:45.084]  They proved they weren't racist, they voted for Obama and they got screwed!
[01:09:46.946 --> 01:09:53.150]  So again, the biggest strength in this is that Obama was repudiated, people came together to elect Trump, so what do they do?
[01:09:53.996 --> 01:09:55.577]  You can't be part of this new future.
[01:09:55.617 --> 01:09:57.237]  You gotta block, you gotta go out and riot.
[01:09:57.637 --> 01:09:59.158]  You can't, no, it's racist.
[01:09:59.198 --> 01:10:01.259]  The KKK just got elected.
[01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:06.921]  That's why the South just voted for Donald Trump, a Yankee.
[01:10:08.102 --> 01:10:09.682]  See, all the rules are off.
[01:10:09.862 --> 01:10:11.263]  All the old garbage is over.
[01:10:11.723 --> 01:10:13.104]  I'm only 42, about to be 43.
[01:10:13.964 --> 01:10:19.386]  I didn't grow up in the world of naked racism.
[01:10:19.426 --> 01:10:21.007]  I mean, if I was naive in one area,
[01:10:21.852 --> 01:10:24.633]  It wasn't women or anything, it was race stuff.
[01:10:26.433 --> 01:10:34.836]  I was so colorblind, that I was so dumb when I was young, I wondered why, why do black people keep trying to beat me up?
[01:10:37.017 --> 01:10:39.198]  Well, now I think back, they were racist.
[01:10:39.378 --> 01:10:46.360]  I was brought up so colorblind, like a dodo bird or something, that I didn't even know what was hitting me.
[01:10:48.261 --> 01:10:49.601]  And that's what's so funny about the whole thing.
[01:10:55.427 --> 01:10:56.047]  This is crazy.
[01:10:59.469 --> 01:11:04.791]  I mean, it really is crazy to see what they've done to reality, how they've turned the whole thing upside down.
[01:11:04.811 --> 01:11:16.555]  I was talking to my dad last night, he came over to the house, about his dad who was elected to different county positions, and how he was the first person in the family to go Republican, and how the KKK hated him and all the rest of it.
[01:11:16.595 --> 01:11:19.856]  And he was like, well, it wasn't that bad.
[01:11:19.896 --> 01:11:24.358]  Sure, they threatened him and did some stuff and did some things, but big deal, they were a bunch of wimps.
[01:11:25.663 --> 01:11:26.604]  Everybody hated them.
[01:11:28.385 --> 01:11:34.448]  He said, my dad was just one of the first people to stand up and say, we're not going to let him push people around anymore.
[01:11:36.689 --> 01:11:37.630]  And then I got to sit here.
[01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:44.353]  When both my grandfathers fought Hitler, one of my grandfathers was in the civil rights movement, just like Chuck Heston.
[01:11:46.414 --> 01:11:52.418]  They called Chuck Heston a racist when he was involved in the 50s, man, almost getting killed, places like Oklahoma and Alabama.
[01:11:53.322 --> 01:11:53.802]  What's he get?
[01:11:53.842 --> 01:11:54.443]  He's called racist?
[01:11:54.523 --> 01:11:55.843]  No, he stood up for everybody.
[01:11:55.863 --> 01:11:57.004]  He stood up for our Second Amendment.
[01:11:57.344 --> 01:11:58.244]  He stood up for civil rights.
[01:11:58.284 --> 01:11:59.265]  He stood up across the board.
[01:11:59.465 --> 01:12:00.365]  He was amazing!
[01:12:00.385 --> 01:12:01.806]  He's a frickin' angel!
[01:12:03.767 --> 01:12:05.868]  Before he died, they called him a racist because he was pro-gun.
[01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:06.688]  What the hell does that mean?
[01:12:07.969 --> 01:12:09.649]  They got these Fox News sports people.
[01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:13.431]  Oh my, the new KKK is the NRA.
[01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:21.775]  The NRA was founded to train northerners on how to shoot and blacks how to shoot so they can protect themselves from the KKK.
[01:12:23.769 --> 01:12:25.690]  I'm so sick of the inversion of reality.
[01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:31.232]  I'm so sick of... I remember I caught black guys getting paid to go testify.
[01:12:31.252 --> 01:12:37.234]  I guess they were like actors, because they didn't talk in like urban accents until they got up on stage.
[01:12:37.855 --> 01:12:39.175]  They're like, yeah, I'm a thug!
[01:12:39.235 --> 01:12:39.996]  I kill people!
[01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:42.256]  I'm black, but I take my guns!
[01:12:42.817 --> 01:12:45.758]  Outside, they're like, thank you, sir, like Urkel, for the money.
[01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:48.579]  And there's a guy paying them 300, 400 bucks a piece.
[01:12:48.599 --> 01:12:50.260]  And I was like, you're actors?
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:53.501]  So the news calls me up, and they go, the Office of American States, and they go,
[01:12:53.661 --> 01:12:54.822]  Did you do this because they're black?
[01:12:54.882 --> 01:12:56.142]  And I went, excuse me?
[01:12:56.503 --> 01:12:57.303]  They were being bribed.
[01:12:57.323 --> 01:12:58.704]  The House Ethics Committee had been sitting there.
[01:12:58.964 --> 01:13:00.324]  We beat a bunch of legislation because of it.
[01:13:00.344 --> 01:13:01.865]  One of my first big stories was in 99.
[01:13:01.965 --> 01:13:05.527]  I mean, I had a bunch of big stories, but that was one of the first really big ones on guns.
[01:13:06.287 --> 01:13:10.490]  When Nationwide NRA picked it up, and they were like, and the paper was like, Alex Jones is a racist.
[01:13:13.331 --> 01:13:17.053]  And they had these black actors up there going, yo, we dangerous, we gonna get you.
[01:13:17.073 --> 01:13:20.034]  And then they go outside, thank you, sir, for the money.
[01:13:22.217 --> 01:13:22.838]  Whoa!
[01:13:23.298 --> 01:13:24.078]  Next level!
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:28.441]  And, I mean, I didn't know that much when I got into all this, folks.
[01:13:28.501 --> 01:13:31.764]  I learned, watching it for myself, that we're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:13:31.804 --> 01:13:33.985]  And they are gaming people big time!
[01:13:34.686 --> 01:13:35.246]  Big time!
[01:13:38.028 --> 01:13:38.608]  And I get it.
[01:13:38.668 --> 01:13:39.569]  People are dishing you.
[01:13:39.589 --> 01:13:40.549]  People treat you bad in your life.
[01:13:40.569 --> 01:13:42.331]  You learn to bow up and be arrogant and not care.
[01:13:42.351 --> 01:13:43.471]  I know how that is.
[01:13:43.772 --> 01:13:44.732]  Hell, I fight the media all day.
[01:13:44.752 --> 01:13:45.653]  I don't care what they say about me.
[01:13:47.148 --> 01:13:48.330]  But it is a mental wound.
[01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:51.897]  It is a projection to say that if we have a border, it's racist.
[01:13:52.498 --> 01:13:56.465]  There's six plus billion people in the third world that want to come here.
[01:13:57.206 --> 01:13:58.388]  The third world's collapsing.
[01:13:59.428 --> 01:14:00.469]  We ought to try to stabilize it.
[01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:05.512]  You don't do that by bringing the total unwashed here who have no future with diseases, you name it.
[01:14:05.813 --> 01:14:07.034]  All you do is drive down wages.
[01:14:07.074 --> 01:14:08.154]  And what do big corporations want?
[01:14:08.174 --> 01:14:09.255]  A permanent poor class.
[01:14:09.555 --> 01:14:10.096]  They want that.
[01:14:10.136 --> 01:14:10.676]  They get that.
[01:14:10.756 --> 01:14:11.277]  It's endgame.
[01:14:11.297 --> 01:14:11.637]  They win.
[01:14:11.657 --> 01:14:15.139]  We're going to come back and go to your phone calls from across the country.
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:16.901]  Bunch of other clips and news to cover.
[01:14:22.062 --> 01:14:26.806]  And also get into some of the lies we're telling about Trump on the border and health care and everything else.
[01:14:26.846 --> 01:14:28.948]  But let me just add this.
[01:14:28.968 --> 01:14:29.828]  We've extended this.
[01:14:31.410 --> 01:14:34.793]  We rarely do this three, four days because it has been so successful.
[01:14:35.173 --> 01:14:37.715]  And folks keep asking us to wait, I guess, till they get paid or whatever.
[01:14:37.735 --> 01:14:39.376]  But we have free shipping across the board.
[01:14:39.416 --> 01:14:41.178]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:14:41.658 --> 01:14:42.599]  Free shipping is a big deal.

[01:14:45.055 --> 01:14:52.328]  On things that are like coffee or nutraceuticals or supplements or things you reorder and you can even order out a year out and you get 10% off additionally.
[01:14:54.056 --> 01:15:00.343]  But the big deal is we've sold out of a few products like the Pro King water filter, but other stuff's on sale as well, other water filters.
[01:15:00.363 --> 01:15:02.905]  30% off Survival Shield X2, the key halogen.

[01:15:17.788 --> 01:15:20.010]  Notice how game-changing we are on politics.
[01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:22.471]  Notice how game-changing we are on future trends.
[01:15:22.491 --> 01:15:25.093]  Because we're not going off the mainstream lie to keep you diverted.
[01:15:25.273 --> 01:15:28.855]  We're going to policy papers and what the elite are really writing, thinking you're too dumb to read it.
[01:15:29.276 --> 01:15:29.696]  But you're not.
[01:15:30.417 --> 01:15:33.118]  When we tell you that X2 will change your life, it's changed mine.
[01:15:33.539 --> 01:15:35.340]  Or that DNA Force is over-the-top amazing.
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:38.962]  Or that SuperMetal Vitality is just over-the-top cool.
[01:15:39.643 --> 01:15:43.705]  Folks, we only go out and find the top sides to bring you the absolute game-changers.
[01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:45.266]  You owe it to yourself.
[01:15:45.306 --> 01:15:46.307]  Plus, it supports the broadcast.
[01:15:46.327 --> 01:15:46.868]  It's a win-win.
[01:15:47.948 --> 01:15:51.132]  A non, you know, zero-sum game.
[01:15:51.572 --> 01:15:55.136]  I think that's the term.
[01:15:55.156 --> 01:15:55.316]  888-253-3139.
[01:15:55.336 --> 01:15:55.436]  888-253-3139.
[01:15:56.017 --> 01:15:57.559]  Or infowarestore.com.
[01:15:57.799 --> 01:16:01.243]  And I want to thank all of you over the years for supporting us and what you've done.
[01:16:01.283 --> 01:16:02.144]  You've seen it bear fruit.
[01:16:02.564 --> 01:16:03.645]  We've lived up to our commitment.
[01:16:03.685 --> 01:16:04.226]  You've done yours.
[01:16:04.246 --> 01:16:05.527]  I want to thank you all.
[01:16:05.607 --> 01:16:06.008]  We'll be back.
[01:16:13.103 --> 01:16:17.747]  Matt Bracken, I mean, people need to understand, from my view, we're in the middle of a civil war still.
[01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:18.307]  What do you say?
[01:16:18.427 --> 01:16:19.208]  They won't give up.
[01:16:19.328 --> 01:16:20.049]  They never quit.
[01:16:20.789 --> 01:16:23.091]  This is the red-green alliance.
[01:16:23.151 --> 01:16:26.013]  This is Islam and the left allied against civilization.
[01:16:26.614 --> 01:16:36.582]  The way that I look at it, the only difference between the moderate Muslims and the radical Muslims is that the moderate Muslims are just demographically planning to take over.
[01:16:37.502 --> 01:16:43.484]  As the radicals, you know, are sort of the bad cop in an ongoing good cop bad cop routine.
[01:16:43.985 --> 01:16:48.166]  The bad cops are blowing up buildings or, you know, driving over people with trucks.
[01:16:49.007 --> 01:16:52.268]  And then we're told, don't make the good Muslims mad.
[01:16:53.181 --> 01:16:54.562]  Just give them a little bit more.
[01:16:54.662 --> 01:16:57.764]  What we're seeing now is the extinguishing of Christianity in Europe.
[01:16:58.164 --> 01:17:01.607]  You think there are going to be these Christmas festivals in Europe outside anymore?
[01:17:01.647 --> 01:17:06.350]  Notice the leftists are all trying to sue and ban Christmas trees.
[01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:08.711]  They say don't even hand out Christmas cards, which is your First Amendment.
[01:17:08.731 --> 01:17:11.533]  They're now saying don't even use holiday in the colleges.
[01:17:11.753 --> 01:17:14.235]  The left is synced up trying to extinct Christianity.
[01:17:14.855 --> 01:17:17.757]  Well, and this is the meaning of Islam.
[01:17:17.817 --> 01:17:19.639]  It's not peace, it's submission.
[01:17:20.219 --> 01:17:21.540]  Islam means submission.
[01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:28.045]  You'll get peace, theoretically, after the entire world has submitted to Islam, which I don't plan to do.
[01:17:28.345 --> 01:17:30.126]  We see it starkly in Germany.
[01:17:30.687 --> 01:17:35.851]  Even now, you know, they are afraid to name what it is, which is Islamic terror.
[01:17:36.631 --> 01:17:41.392]  Something that all Muslims need to know, all the quote-unquote moderate Muslims.
[01:17:41.732 --> 01:17:47.134]  When the elites are worried, they're not worried about us getting run over in the streets or blown up in a cafe.
[01:17:47.614 --> 01:17:48.414]  They could care less.
[01:17:48.454 --> 01:17:49.154]  We're the peasants.
[01:17:49.214 --> 01:17:50.475]  We're outside of the green zone.
[01:17:50.755 --> 01:17:59.137]  So when somebody in a suit and tie with a clean-shaven face walks up and shoots a tier one, you know, ambassador in the head, that gets their attention.
[01:17:59.981 --> 01:18:06.428]  So, you know, the elites, they start to freak out when they see their own security agents assassinating them from behind.
[01:18:06.668 --> 01:18:08.390]  What do you think the overall message is?
[01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:15.638]  I mean, the jihadis, I guess, I mean, as you said, they're testing Merkel and others to make sure they sit there and cover up it's Islam.
[01:18:15.918 --> 01:18:16.759]  That's part of their deal.
[01:18:18.155 --> 01:18:22.460]  Right, well, if Merkel doesn't resign now, obviously she's never going to resign.
[01:18:22.941 --> 01:18:25.684]  If she's re-elected then, put a fork in Germany.
[01:18:26.345 --> 01:18:28.528]  And as Germany goes, Europe goes.
[01:18:28.608 --> 01:18:31.271]  And remember also, in Germany and across Europe,
[01:18:32.063 --> 01:18:38.048]  It's only because of the luck and incompetence on the part of these terrorists that there aren't attacks like last night weekly.
[01:18:38.528 --> 01:18:43.612]  And there was a 12-year-old about a week ago who was trying to take a nail bomb into another festival.
[01:18:44.012 --> 01:18:59.905]  You know, if an attack of sufficient magnitude happens even under President Trump, it really wouldn't be that much of a different outcome if there's, say, a grid attack, you know, or even just a simple kinetic rifle attack against enough, you know, power substations.
[01:19:00.862 --> 01:19:04.444]  Putting this country into a grid-down scenario is going to be ugly no matter who's in charge.
[01:19:09.308 --> 01:19:11.109]  I'm going to lay it out short and sweet.
[01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:18.454]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:23.057]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[01:19:24.005 --> 01:19:26.228]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[01:19:26.308 --> 01:19:27.470]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[01:19:27.490 --> 01:19:30.694]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[01:19:31.695 --> 01:19:32.036]  Or more.
[01:19:32.116 --> 01:19:34.079]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[01:19:34.539 --> 01:19:36.041]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[01:19:36.121 --> 01:19:39.486]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[01:19:39.586 --> 01:19:41.348]  It's actually scary.
[01:19:42.213 --> 01:19:52.298]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[01:19:53.299 --> 01:20:06.106]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.
[01:20:12.358 --> 01:20:18.323]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:21.545 --> 01:20:26.149]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:26.209 --> 01:20:26.749]  Watch me!
[01:20:26.829 --> 01:20:27.369]  Watch me!
[01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:29.151]  I got some... Watch me!
[01:20:34.684 --> 01:20:38.145]  InfoWars.com.
[01:20:38.846 --> 01:20:47.489]  We're going to be updating the site soon, launching some new sites that are more high-tech, but folks kind of like our... It's not really low-tech, but it's a couple-year-old design.
[01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:49.610]  And we're going to roll out a lot of new things.
[01:20:49.630 --> 01:20:52.651]  We'll roll out the new free app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:20:53.011 --> 01:21:00.494]  There's a paid app that we're really about to ramp up that has promo codes and coupons for the store that are worth it the first time you buy it.
[01:21:00.514 --> 01:21:00.854]  $4.95 a month.
[01:21:01.614 --> 01:21:03.015]  It's half price out of the gates.
[01:21:03.935 --> 01:21:11.220]  Uh, but we're going to have where all my reporters, myself, every day do live special reports, tape reports, original films, you name it.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:20.927]  I want to build it to a whole new, like, YouTube platform that's separate from all that, aka Matt Drudge's advice, have our own systems that are separate from the bigger platforms.
[01:21:21.367 --> 01:21:30.273]  We'll also put a lot of that information on there, but it's just more and more we're being censored by Facebook and YouTube, and they've been spanking Facebook in the New York Times and the Washington Post.
[01:21:30.693 --> 01:21:31.974]  You're the reason Trump won.
[01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:33.515]  You didn't censor enough.
[01:21:35.196 --> 01:21:39.818]  Well, when Trump supports 30 to 1, what are you going to do?
[01:21:39.898 --> 01:21:42.119]  I mean, she had crowds of 300 on average.
[01:21:42.559 --> 01:21:44.020]  She had crowds of 20,000 on average.
[01:21:45.261 --> 01:21:46.922]  He probably won the biggest victory in history.
[01:21:47.182 --> 01:21:48.702]  They stole so hard.
[01:21:49.743 --> 01:21:53.705]  Ev Harris, Democrat, liberal, top expert, stole at least five states.
[01:21:53.825 --> 01:21:54.625]  She still lost.
[01:21:54.645 --> 01:21:57.467]  This is epic, epic.
[01:21:57.487 --> 01:22:01.209]  I want to go to your phone calls just briefly, and I'll flesh this out more during the weekday show.
[01:22:02.543 --> 01:22:04.904]  The big attack is he's waffling isn't delivering.
[01:22:05.904 --> 01:22:12.267]  When he said I'm gonna get rid of Obamacare, he meant the forced mandate tax level that you have to have it.
[01:22:12.867 --> 01:22:20.791]  They're gonna produce a government system where you can go into a market and where you can't be refused if you have a pre-existing condition.
[01:22:22.054 --> 01:22:23.675]  And children can stay on until 26.
[01:22:25.176 --> 01:22:27.478]  He thinks those are good provisions, his advisors do.
[01:22:28.059 --> 01:22:34.043]  He said that a year ago when they put it on the damn website, and I'm sorry, but man, they play people because they don't pay attention.
[01:22:34.563 --> 01:22:37.225]  That's what he said a year ago on the website.
[01:22:38.786 --> 01:22:42.950]  He never said all Mexicans are criminals, and he's ready to deport all of them that are illegal.
[01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:51.216]  He said, if you're a felon, and we catch you in a checkpoint or a stop or whatever, you're going back.
[01:22:52.369 --> 01:22:56.672]  People that are here illegally, we're gonna create a process for you to go out and come back in if you're not a criminal.
[01:22:58.573 --> 01:23:00.374]  And if you're skilled, boom, we're gonna bring you here.
[01:23:01.775 --> 01:23:04.637]  As long as the factories are here, I don't care if we bring skilled workers in.
[01:23:05.178 --> 01:23:06.198]  We gotta compete, folks.
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:09.961]  Some would call that too liberal of a plan.
[01:23:09.981 --> 01:23:12.002]  The reason I like it with Trump, it's a real plan.
[01:23:12.403 --> 01:23:13.824]  He's not lying to you.
[01:23:14.164 --> 01:23:15.505]  It's so refreshing.
[01:23:18.263 --> 01:23:19.484]  It's like these protests everywhere.
[01:23:19.504 --> 01:23:21.386]  On camera, people pick it up from California to Texas.
[01:23:21.406 --> 01:23:30.675]  They go, he's a homophobe, he wants to... You could criticize him from a conservative perspective that he's been pro-equality for 30 years.
[01:23:33.564 --> 01:23:43.209]  Hillary in her speech at the DNC didn't mention being nice to LGBT and all that stuff and everybody clapping.
[01:23:43.289 --> 01:23:50.072]  Again, my biggest problem with the Trump bashing is, and I got some issues with Trump, is that it's none of it's reality based.
[01:23:50.693 --> 01:23:58.277]  It's like this Amy Schumer article she put out that has hundreds of thousands of shares and likes millions of readers that I caught in our ad feed on InfoWars.
[01:23:58.617 --> 01:24:00.038]  I'm going to get rid of that ad feed, man.
[01:24:00.718 --> 01:24:02.319]  It's all this anti-liberty crap.
[01:24:03.012 --> 01:24:06.153]  But I gotta get money to fund the operation, but at the same time, I'm not gonna put this out.
[01:24:06.413 --> 01:24:08.913]  That's why I almost have no advertising, is crap like this.
[01:24:10.574 --> 01:24:16.375]  I caught this on other sites that are Patriot, where he says that if he runs the Republican, they're the dumbest people and all this stuff.
[01:24:16.615 --> 01:24:22.517]  And she admits later, oh by the way, this is a fake quote, knowing no one's gonna actually read pages, two pages down to the fine print.
[01:24:26.938 --> 01:24:28.258]  I don't like scumbags.
[01:24:30.802 --> 01:24:33.203]  I don't like people scamming everybody.
[01:24:33.283 --> 01:24:34.304]  I'm sick of it.
[01:24:34.324 --> 01:24:35.084]  And you know what I don't like?
[01:24:35.845 --> 01:24:37.025]  The public buying into it.
[01:24:37.545 --> 01:24:38.426]  Alright, let's take a few calls.
[01:24:38.446 --> 01:24:39.526]  We've got two more segments coming up.
[01:24:39.546 --> 01:24:40.747]  We'll get to a few right now.
[01:24:40.767 --> 01:24:45.830]  We've got Rusty and Charles and Dean and Owl Killer and Raven and Tony and James and Wade and Mitchell.
[01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:47.150]  Who's up first?
[01:24:47.170 --> 01:24:49.611]  Let's go to James in the great state of Seattle.
[01:24:49.892 --> 01:24:50.852]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:24:52.073 --> 01:24:54.014]  Wow, thanks for taking my call, brother.
[01:24:54.614 --> 01:24:55.374]  God bless you, man.
[01:24:55.514 --> 01:24:55.955]  God bless you.
[01:24:55.975 --> 01:24:56.475]  What's on your mind?
[01:24:57.977 --> 01:25:07.340]  Uh, a warning of a prophecy warning that has been very silenced and quieted by many people in the Christian community.
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:11.001]  And this timeline might be wrong, but I have to get it out.
[01:25:11.061 --> 01:25:13.121]  Blood's on my hands, and you need to know about it.
[01:25:13.181 --> 01:25:13.761]  Be aware of it.
[01:25:13.781 --> 01:25:14.682]  Sure, well just tell us.
[01:25:14.702 --> 01:25:16.842]  Whose prophecy and what?
[01:25:17.002 --> 01:25:22.004]  A man who died in 2008-ish, a man named Dewey Bruton.
[01:25:22.724 --> 01:25:23.544]  It's on YouTube.
[01:25:23.664 --> 01:25:25.384]  It's called Daniel's Timeline.
[01:25:25.504 --> 01:25:26.745]  It ends November 17th.
[01:25:28.728 --> 01:25:37.310]  And Obama, coincidentally, left the country for six days to do a speech in Greece, where it all began.
[01:25:38.069 --> 01:25:45.671]  Because we're still following a timeline that says he is the beast, and people better wake up because... I hear where you're going, and I appreciate your call.
[01:25:46.412 --> 01:25:48.072]  People say he's still got two months in office.
[01:25:48.552 --> 01:25:50.253]  Will they start World War III before then?
[01:25:51.273 --> 01:25:57.195]  And they've been trying to start World War III with Russia, and people say, why isn't Trump winning with Russia?
[01:25:57.255 --> 01:25:58.435]  Russia has two bases.
[01:25:59.195 --> 01:26:00.896]  Russia's trying to not collapse.
[01:26:01.396 --> 01:26:02.316]  Russia's done nothing.
[01:26:02.476 --> 01:26:06.097]  I'm not anti-China, but China is buying up Hollywood in our business.
[01:26:06.778 --> 01:26:07.258]  I went and saw
[01:26:08.536 --> 01:26:09.417]  Arrival last night.
[01:26:10.237 --> 01:26:11.718]  Plus all my parents are where we're keeping the kids.
[01:26:12.759 --> 01:26:15.200]  And it was just all Chinese propaganda.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:18.102]  Nothing is Chinese, but every movie is on the Chinese service.
[01:26:18.963 --> 01:26:20.984]  Because they're buying up all of Hollywood right now.
[01:26:21.804 --> 01:26:22.945]  It's like, no, this is our country.
[01:26:23.785 --> 01:26:26.327]  We can't go buy China's movie production.
[01:26:26.627 --> 01:26:27.448]  They'd never let you do that.
[01:26:27.508 --> 01:26:28.368]  This is getting serious.
[01:26:30.029 --> 01:26:30.590]  Thank you, James.
[01:26:32.171 --> 01:26:33.792]  Owl Killer in New Jersey.
[01:26:33.812 --> 01:26:34.452]  You're on the air.
[01:26:35.893 --> 01:26:36.613]  Hey Alex, am I on?
[01:26:36.774 --> 01:26:37.034]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:38.123 --> 01:26:41.765]  Hey, all I have to say is thank God for the renegades and the life they lead.
[01:26:42.305 --> 01:26:43.525]  Way far ahead of their time.
[01:26:44.426 --> 01:26:46.647]  Thank God for the renegades, absolutely.
[01:26:47.247 --> 01:26:51.489]  I have some very important stuff to put out about Trump.
[01:26:51.649 --> 01:26:59.493]  Well, I went to go see Roger Stone at the Palladium about four weeks ago and I got a book signed and I spoke to him for a couple minutes.
[01:27:00.133 --> 01:27:01.554]  It was about the Clinton's war on women.
[01:27:02.194 --> 01:27:03.615]  Now we have Trump in office.
[01:27:04.655 --> 01:27:06.396]  You can see the system is scared to death of him.
[01:27:07.068 --> 01:27:08.269]  We're going to have the Supreme Court.
[01:27:08.429 --> 01:27:16.493]  He's got to put the most conservative, the most constitutional... By the way, let me interrupt you just because I want to say this earlier.
[01:27:17.094 --> 01:27:22.997]  The litmus test is he better put somebody more conservative than Scalia.
[01:27:23.497 --> 01:27:25.558]  I want patriots and I want them now.
[01:27:25.879 --> 01:27:26.879]  And that's my litmus test.
[01:27:26.939 --> 01:27:30.181]  If he doesn't do that, I am going ape, S-H, you know what.
[01:27:31.462 --> 01:27:31.982]  Absolutely.
[01:27:32.542 --> 01:27:35.244]  Now, the day he got elected,
[01:27:35.936 --> 01:27:39.419]  There was such a breath of fresh air and relief in the military.
[01:27:39.439 --> 01:27:45.424]  There's people that got out that are trying to get back in, that were furious at what's been going on, that are trying to come back in.
[01:27:46.045 --> 01:27:48.447]  Now, this is where the game plan comes in.
[01:27:48.907 --> 01:27:51.509]  We've got to press the local government.
[01:27:51.729 --> 01:27:55.773]  Everybody has to get involved, from the sheriffs, to your councilmen, to your mayors, to your governors.
[01:27:56.253 --> 01:28:03.019]  We're going to squash the New World Order like a trash bag, from the top all the way to the bottom, and we're going to meet them right in the middle.
[01:28:05.912 --> 01:28:06.833]  We're good to go.
[01:28:26.607 --> 01:28:27.849]  Political correctness repudiated.
[01:28:27.869 --> 01:28:28.890]  The media destroyed.
[01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:30.552]  The pollsters proven to be fraudsters.
[01:28:30.992 --> 01:28:32.294]  The victory was him running.
[01:28:32.534 --> 01:28:33.555]  The victory was him winning.
[01:28:33.615 --> 01:28:35.357]  We have had a devastating victory.
[01:28:35.678 --> 01:28:41.745]  Let's not let them get us all pissy and sour it because he doesn't deliver it all before he's not even in office.
[01:28:44.062 --> 01:28:54.972]  Here's the thing, now, with the whole issue with Hillary's pardons, let her get her pardons, and let's get the Freedom of Information Act, and just bury them and everybody that's attached to them for the rest of their lives.
[01:28:55.032 --> 01:28:55.493]  No, no, I hear you.
[01:28:55.513 --> 01:28:57.655]  Let me give you the inside baseball.
[01:28:58.516 --> 01:28:59.036]  Here's the problem.
[01:28:59.056 --> 01:29:00.337]  At this level, they're all watching.
[01:29:00.378 --> 01:29:02.480]  Should I give people the inside baseball?
[01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:03.140]  Should I let you know?
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:05.923]  I think they're smart enough to already know.
[01:29:09.305 --> 01:29:12.246]  As Americans, this whole country is under attack.
[01:29:12.786 --> 01:29:14.367]  And the reason why is very simple.
[01:29:14.407 --> 01:29:18.088]  If you don't take down the biggest guy on the block, then you don't have anything yet.
[01:29:18.809 --> 01:29:25.691]  And so this new world order, most of the people around the world have no idea what's going on, so they're very easy to knock over.
[01:29:26.192 --> 01:29:32.374]  But America has always been on the forefront of intellectual and education and knowledge.
[01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:57.077]  technology so unless you can destroy this base of resistance to tyranny then you haven't done anything that's why they are continuing to attack America because America is the only country left that offers freedom and liberty and justice for all and all of that kind of ideas and thinking that came that came out of the Renaissance and so
[01:29:57.837 --> 01:29:58.677]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:30:00.358 --> 01:30:01.438]  We are under attack.
[01:30:01.458 --> 01:30:25.787]  This is why in the book, Fire in the Minds of Men, James Billington, who is today the Chief Librarian for the Library of Congress, this is Bill Slouch, Chief Librarian for the Library of Congress, wrote a book called Fire in the Minds of Men, in which he explained this whole idea of calling things democratic.
[01:30:26.507 --> 01:30:26.708]  I think?
[01:30:37.492 --> 01:30:46.377]  We need to understand that when you use the word democratic today, it does not mean the people's democratic thinking and from the Grecian Empire.
[01:30:46.397 --> 01:30:52.301]  We're talking about corporate democracy, which is actually today called communism.
[01:30:52.801 --> 01:30:58.365]  Sure, so we're not talking about a constitutional republic like ours, the first and pretty much only.
[01:30:58.385 --> 01:30:58.785]  No, not at all.
[01:30:58.805 --> 01:31:05.209]  We're talking about a democratic republic, which means a politburo, a secretariat, a totally staged event.
[01:31:05.869 --> 01:31:27.458]  Precisely, and that's exactly why today the communist movement throughout the world is absolutely elated when Obama was made president, because finally, they finally got a full-blown Marxist-Leninist Soviet communist, old-school Soviet communist
[01:31:28.338 --> 01:31:34.859]  Oh, they even use the classic communist paintings where it shows her face and other faces and it's the exact same iconography.
[01:31:55.863 --> 01:31:56.484]  Absolutely.
[01:31:56.564 --> 01:32:04.406]  So, you need to understand that democracy today in America is not a people's democracy where people matter.
[01:32:04.666 --> 01:32:08.688]  It's a corporate democracy under world communism.
[01:32:08.908 --> 01:32:12.749]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.

[01:32:39.790 --> 01:32:43.551]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today.

[01:33:06.498 --> 01:33:08.179]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:33:11.488 --> 01:33:17.451]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.038 --> 01:33:37.282]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:38.939 --> 01:33:47.106]  Well, I was told this a few hours ago when I was still at home, and then I got some calls here about 30 minutes ago, and it just went live on Infowars.com.
[01:33:48.387 --> 01:33:52.570]  Trump names Priebus, chief of staff, Bannon's senior counselor.
[01:33:53.611 --> 01:33:55.552]  Now, again, Priebus knows how D.C.
[01:33:55.592 --> 01:33:55.853]  works.
[01:33:55.893 --> 01:33:57.454]  He knows who the people are.
[01:33:57.474 --> 01:33:58.295]  He knows Congress.
[01:33:58.915 --> 01:34:02.638]  He stabbed Trump in the back, I don't know, 40 times, is what I was told by an insider.
[01:34:04.099 --> 01:34:07.382]  And Trump knows that, but, I mean, these people roll over to whoever their master is.
[01:34:07.402 --> 01:34:08.403]  That's what they do, is follow orders.
[01:34:09.443 --> 01:34:18.087]  So if he knows, kind of like the janitor that knows where all the keys fit and where all the detergent is, I'm trusting Trump because the enemy hates him.
[01:34:18.587 --> 01:34:21.808]  He's already trying to deliver on tax cuts, controlling the border, and so much more.
[01:34:21.868 --> 01:34:24.809]  But stuff on InfoWars.com is from Fox News.
[01:34:25.269 --> 01:34:28.271]  Trump names Priebus Chief of Staff Bannon Senior Counselor.
[01:34:29.851 --> 01:34:33.673]  So that just means that Bannon will be up there helping make the decisions, but then Priebus will carry out the will.
[01:34:33.693 --> 01:34:34.353]  So that's a good thing.
[01:34:34.753 --> 01:34:37.975]  Trump said that Priebus and Bannon will work as equal partners.
[01:34:38.055 --> 01:34:38.575]  So that's good.
[01:34:40.407 --> 01:34:46.851]  President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday appointed Republican National Committee Chairman Rentz Priebus as the White House.
[01:34:46.971 --> 01:34:48.893]  That's almost like putting Paul Ryan in.
[01:34:48.933 --> 01:34:52.435]  I mean, Paul Ryan's many times worse and a total demon.
[01:34:52.475 --> 01:35:00.421]  But Trump also announced that campaign CEO Stephen Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, will be his chief strategist and senior counselor.
[01:35:01.121 --> 01:35:06.304]  Bannon was notably given top billing in the press release announcing the appointments, and that's what I was going to say earlier.
[01:35:06.764 --> 01:35:07.624]  We have this clip.
[01:35:08.145 --> 01:35:13.147]  Kathleen Conway said Steve Bannon has been the general in this campaign, but says that Priebus is being looked at.
[01:35:13.487 --> 01:35:17.589]  Let's cue that up, play that, and then go back to phone calls, because this really says it all.
[01:35:17.889 --> 01:35:20.471]  Now again, Trump said 100 with me.
[01:35:22.298 --> 01:35:23.378]  And he's staying at 100.
[01:35:24.279 --> 01:35:26.239]  He gets in in 60-something days.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:27.800]  We see delivery.
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:28.700]  67 days.
[01:35:29.401 --> 01:35:30.581]  We see him fighting hard on this.
[01:35:30.621 --> 01:35:31.061]  That's great.
[01:35:31.621 --> 01:35:34.442]  But these Republican weasels will tell him whatever they want to hear.
[01:35:34.462 --> 01:35:39.164]  Oh, they're cooking up scandals behind the scenes and leaking information to everybody under the sun.
[01:35:39.884 --> 01:35:42.225]  And I think he just put Henry Kissinger in his administration.
[01:35:43.006 --> 01:35:44.086]  I think this is a bad move.
[01:35:48.891 --> 01:35:50.992]  And I told him it was a bad move Friday, but whatever.
[01:35:51.012 --> 01:35:52.213]  Trump can do whatever he wants, I'm sure.
[01:35:52.253 --> 01:35:53.854]  He's smarter than I am anyway, so whatever.
[01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:55.595]  I'm not pissed.
[01:35:55.635 --> 01:35:56.556]  I'm very, very happy.
[01:35:56.636 --> 01:35:58.777]  We've defeated the globalists on so many fronts.
[01:36:00.038 --> 01:36:01.019]  The media is discredited.
[01:36:01.039 --> 01:36:01.939]  The pollsters are discredited.
[01:36:01.959 --> 01:36:02.880]  They're in total pain.
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.481]  Trump's getting ready to turn the power plants back on.
[01:36:05.522 --> 01:36:07.743]  I mean, he's not out to get us.
[01:36:07.823 --> 01:36:08.383]  It's wonderful.
[01:36:09.044 --> 01:36:10.845]  But I'll tell you what I really think.
[01:36:10.865 --> 01:36:15.248]  I think Priebus is a grand weasel.
[01:36:16.314 --> 01:36:17.775]  But maybe he can be Trump's weasel.
[01:36:17.815 --> 01:36:21.657]  Maybe he's just, you know, maybe he's just a good little servant and does whatever he's told.
[01:36:21.717 --> 01:36:25.279]  I mean, I've seen a major flip in some media figuring out there's a new sheriff in town.
[01:36:25.319 --> 01:36:25.679]  We'll see.
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:32.043]  But here is Conway, former head of the campaign, the spokeswoman, talking about this earlier today.
[01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:44.358]  The two leading candidates are reportedly Republican party chair and insider Reince Priebus and campaign CEO Steve Bannon, who's a fierce anti-establishment critic of Washington.
[01:36:45.319 --> 01:37:00.650]  Won't that, Kellyanne, tell us a lot about how Mr. Trump plans to govern, whether he chooses an insider, maybe he still wants to change it, but by using an insider, or whether he chooses somebody from the outsider who really does view Washington as a swamp?
[01:37:02.102 --> 01:37:10.951]  Well, it tells you a great deal about President Trump that both of those men are thought to have very important roles in his administration, very senior roles.
[01:37:11.491 --> 01:37:14.535]  And that, regardless of title, that is absolutely what's going to happen.
[01:37:14.555 --> 01:37:20.701]  And that is probably the case for most of his very small but loyal and frankly effective senior team in our circle.
[01:37:21.221 --> 01:37:27.304]  But I, you know, the thing about Steve Bannon that people don't understand is that in this campaign he's been the general.
[01:37:27.444 --> 01:37:31.566]  And he's worked very closely with Reince Priebus and the rest of us as part of that small core team.
[01:37:31.926 --> 01:37:34.087]  We couldn't have done it without Priebus or Bannon.
[01:37:34.207 --> 01:37:36.328]  I can say that unequivocally as the campaign manager.
[01:37:36.348 --> 01:37:38.649]  Sure, and we weren't there for all things that happened.
[01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:40.970]  And by the way, I never convince myself of what I want to believe.
[01:37:40.990 --> 01:37:42.210]  I go with my gut.
[01:37:42.991 --> 01:37:45.852]  And I don't trust Priebus, but I'll say this, it just clicked.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:48.100]  Trump is really smart.
[01:37:48.401 --> 01:38:02.286]  He's got the outsider that'll give him the vice and be his chief counselor, who then just send a little gremlin down the rat hole, a little goblin, to take him through the different portals and different entrances and exits.
[01:38:02.326 --> 01:38:05.247]  And I'll say this, knowing Trump, because it all just clicked while I was watching that clip.
[01:38:05.967 --> 01:38:09.029]  If Priebus doesn't deliver, his ass will be gone in a month or two.
[01:38:09.589 --> 01:38:14.511]  In fact, I think once Priebus, I'm predicting this now, unless he totally rolls over to Liberty,
[01:38:15.458 --> 01:38:17.219]  But Trump never forgives a traitor, I can tell you that.
[01:38:18.179 --> 01:38:20.321]  I think Priebus is gone in 90 days.
[01:38:20.821 --> 01:38:22.182]  After they're in office.
[01:38:23.442 --> 01:38:31.807]  I'll bet you that by... I bet by May of 2017, Priebus is gone.
[01:38:32.007 --> 01:38:32.647]  Or demoted.
[01:38:33.828 --> 01:38:34.228]  You heard it.
[01:38:35.845 --> 01:38:40.491]  Because I know how Trump works, and I know my gut tells me he's on the right target, and I know the enemy is scared of him.
[01:38:40.531 --> 01:38:41.131]  But here's the deal.
[01:38:41.732 --> 01:38:42.433]  I don't want to say this.
[01:38:42.473 --> 01:38:44.215]  We got 67 days left.
[01:38:44.355 --> 01:38:45.637]  The globalists are scared to death.
[01:38:46.037 --> 01:38:50.202]  If Trump doesn't play possum a little bit, they'll probably try to kill him or start a war.
[01:38:50.242 --> 01:38:50.583]  I don't know.
[01:38:51.224 --> 01:38:53.606]  The problem is they're, well, they underestimated Trump already, so.
[01:38:55.247 --> 01:38:57.828]  The point is, is that I think, I'm betting on Trump.
[01:38:58.628 --> 01:39:01.329]  I mean, he's already trying to get rid of the Obamacare.
[01:39:01.349 --> 01:39:03.110]  Oh, that's another lie, he's not getting rid of Obamacare.
[01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:05.811]  He's getting rid of the provision that is the forced mandate.
[01:39:06.531 --> 01:39:10.952]  But that insurance companies have to have pre-existing condition if they take your money, that's only fair.
[01:39:11.713 --> 01:39:18.655]  And that 26-year-olds, you're 26 and you're telling your parents insurance, that sounds reasonable because that's when you're out of college by then.
[01:39:19.815 --> 01:39:20.916]  That's stuff that everybody agreed to.
[01:39:21.578 --> 01:39:25.839]  But then they spin it, oh, he backed off, oh, he's not gonna deport every person illegally!
[01:39:25.859 --> 01:39:27.820]  He's not gonna have a force that goes to every building!
[01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:29.440]  We already have a force that does that.
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:36.962]  But notice, Paul Ryan comes out and lies there by the news and goes, I'll assure you, we're not doing any of this, Congress isn't doing it, I speak for Trump.
[01:39:37.002 --> 01:39:37.202]  What?
[01:39:38.642 --> 01:39:43.943]  Undermining him, undermining, undermining, playing games, because he wants the big money.
[01:39:43.983 --> 01:39:47.124]  He's still, we haven't kicked the globalists out yet, we haven't drained the swamp.
[01:39:47.404 --> 01:39:49.765]  We've gotta have somebody that knows the depths of the swamp,
[01:39:51.227 --> 01:39:54.771]  It's against the swamp, but I... What do you think?
[01:39:54.791 --> 01:39:58.995]  You got Rusty and Charles and Dean and Raven and so many others.
[01:39:59.015 --> 01:40:01.578]  Who should we talk to first?
[01:40:01.618 --> 01:40:02.619]  Let's talk to Raven.
[01:40:03.239 --> 01:40:04.581]  Raven in North Carolina.
[01:40:07.361 --> 01:40:12.346]  Alex, I couldn't vote for John McCain or Mitt Romney because I knew who they were.
[01:40:13.087 --> 01:40:17.572]  I couldn't vote for Barack Hussein Obama because the writing was all over the law.
[01:40:17.952 --> 01:40:22.457]  You don't seem to have a very good memory, but you had exposed him before the first election that he ran in.
[01:40:23.195 --> 01:40:23.415]  Are you
[01:40:37.856 --> 01:40:38.216]  I think?
[01:41:01.108 --> 01:41:12.576]  Impartial, complete investigation of Hillary Clinton and her crimes, with her foundation, all of that stuff, all these other criminals, and the Justice Department.
[01:41:22.253 --> 01:41:25.096]  Yeah, I'm hoping... I'll be honest with you.
[01:41:25.156 --> 01:41:26.637]  I never followed Trump in my whole life.
[01:41:26.697 --> 01:41:27.558]  I don't have television.
[01:41:27.578 --> 01:41:29.260]  I haven't had television in like 10 years.
[01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:32.282]  So I mean, I heard... So what told you to like him?
[01:41:32.302 --> 01:41:33.784]  Just the fact that the enemy was against him?
[01:41:35.135 --> 01:41:35.956]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:41:36.016 --> 01:41:38.297]  All of his enemies, all the people that are coming out against him.
[01:41:39.258 --> 01:41:44.681]  No one was ever able to convince me that Donald Trump hated America like all these others.
[01:41:44.701 --> 01:41:45.181]  He doesn't.
[01:41:45.961 --> 01:41:54.927]  They either hate him, they either hate America, or they're willing, they're a bunch of weasels and snakes, and they're willing to sell us out and they actually... Or they really are racist.
[01:41:54.987 --> 01:41:57.728]  I mean, it's not just white racists, there's anti-white racists as well.
[01:41:57.748 --> 01:42:02.111]  Oh, and they're self-hating white racists as well.
[01:42:02.830 --> 01:42:04.031]  Well, that seems to be who leads it.
[01:42:04.071 --> 01:42:06.613]  I don't get this whole... It's crazy.
[01:42:06.673 --> 01:42:08.074]  So what's your gut tell you?
[01:42:08.634 --> 01:42:09.755]  Alex, come on, man.
[01:42:10.055 --> 01:42:12.376]  Let's be genuine here.
[01:42:12.396 --> 01:42:16.419]  A lot of these people that we're calling white don't consider themselves to be white.
[01:42:16.439 --> 01:42:18.841]  They consider themselves to be above white.
[01:42:19.721 --> 01:42:22.263]  They're Jewish, and they don't consider themselves to be black.
[01:42:23.364 --> 01:42:30.549]  And one other point, uh, I know you've got liberal Jews, conservatives, you've got people fighting the new world order that are Jewish across the board.
[01:42:30.569 --> 01:42:35.832]  So how do you just sit there and say, oh, you know, Jews, I mean, I, I want to get past all the names and just promote freedom.
[01:42:36.727 --> 01:42:38.687]  They always seem to frame the debate.
[01:42:38.747 --> 01:42:40.168]  They always seem to frame the narrative.
[01:42:40.188 --> 01:42:42.588]  They take the left and the right, and then they control it.
[01:42:42.608 --> 01:42:43.308]  You get that simply.
[01:42:43.368 --> 01:42:44.168]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[01:42:44.188 --> 01:42:44.988]  Here's the good news.
[01:42:45.028 --> 01:42:45.769]  Here's the good news.
[01:42:45.909 --> 01:42:47.089]  This whole thing's getting shattered.
[01:42:47.569 --> 01:42:48.749]  People don't want to have World War III.
[01:42:48.769 --> 01:42:50.609]  I don't care whether they're German, Jewish, or Chinese.
[01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:52.570]  But, listen, I'll agree with you on this.
[01:42:53.490 --> 01:42:54.170]  Trump's for real.
[01:42:54.530 --> 01:42:56.650]  He's got the system scared, and he's got my back.
[01:42:56.670 --> 01:42:58.931]  I want to see what he does once he gets in.
[01:42:58.971 --> 01:43:01.191]  I'm going to let him navigate the waters he's in.
[01:43:01.231 --> 01:43:02.011]  I'm not there with him.
[01:43:03.111 --> 01:43:04.592]  But, I mean, I really do have a good feeling.
[01:43:04.612 --> 01:43:05.652]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[01:43:09.485 --> 01:43:14.288]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[01:43:14.428 --> 01:43:21.492]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[01:43:21.752 --> 01:43:24.154]  I started to exercise really hard again.
[01:43:24.614 --> 01:43:30.239]  And I started to try to eat healthy, started taking third party supplements, started seeing some more gains.
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:41.150]  But when I started working with Dr. Group and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that the population is absolutely deficient in.
[01:43:41.310 --> 01:43:41.570]  Boom!
[01:43:41.991 --> 01:43:45.414]  Weight started pouring off, toxins started coming out of my body.
[01:43:45.894 --> 01:43:47.055]  Then, by early 2016,
[01:43:49.097 --> 01:43:52.459]  I was in the best shape of my life since I've been in really good shape in my 20s.
[01:43:52.479 --> 01:43:53.540]  But the election heated up.
[01:43:53.580 --> 01:43:55.961]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[01:43:56.081 --> 01:44:05.326]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[01:44:05.546 --> 01:44:06.507]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[01:44:06.687 --> 01:44:10.369]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:17.237]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again, and I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[01:44:17.257 --> 01:44:18.618]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[01:44:18.678 --> 01:44:22.243]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[01:44:24.076 --> 01:44:30.881]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table, I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[01:44:31.221 --> 01:44:37.685]  I've lost five pounds religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[01:44:38.086 --> 01:44:38.606]  It's amazing.
[01:44:38.926 --> 01:44:41.288]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[01:44:41.568 --> 01:44:44.270]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:53.056]  And to be clear, I'm exercising the same amount, it's the holidays, so I'm eating pumpkin pie, pecan pie, I ate a candy bar last night,
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:57.622]  I mean, quite frankly, I eat more junk during the holidays like everybody else.
[01:44:58.082 --> 01:44:59.323]  So I'm eating worse.
[01:44:59.963 --> 01:45:07.328]  But because I've got these trace elements, or whatever it's doing in DNA Force and X2 and Supermail, I have lost 5 pounds.
[01:45:07.488 --> 01:45:08.008]  It's incredible.
[01:45:09.029 --> 01:45:10.950]  I thought I might lose 10 to 15 in a month.
[01:45:11.190 --> 01:45:12.451]  If this continues, it'll be 20.
[01:45:12.571 --> 01:45:14.973]  But generally, it's more dramatic up front.
[01:45:15.593 --> 01:45:16.454]  This is an experiment.
[01:45:16.574 --> 01:45:17.334]  Everybody's watching.
[01:45:17.574 --> 01:45:18.395]  We'll see what happens.
[01:45:18.835 --> 01:45:19.696]  This is Part 2.
[01:45:23.814 --> 01:45:25.575]  Well here we are, another week has passed.
[01:45:26.176 --> 01:45:38.265]  If memory serves, I lost 5 pounds the first week, 3 pounds the next, and only 1 pound this week because it's the holidays, there's fudge, there's candy, it's everywhere, and I've been picking out eggnog, you name it.
[01:45:38.305 --> 01:45:41.628]  This is the worst time of year, but usually you're gaining weight, I've lost a pound.
[01:45:42.128 --> 01:45:43.109]  So we're now up to 9 pounds.
[01:45:44.662 --> 01:45:48.865]  And I've only got a week and a half left or so until we see what happens in this experiment.
[01:45:48.885 --> 01:45:50.466]  But I'm pretty happy with 9 pounds.
[01:45:50.506 --> 01:45:52.567]  But I want to lose 5 or 6 more.
[01:45:53.428 --> 01:45:58.111]  But as I said, I'm working out less, I'm eating more, I'm taking the supplements, I'm losing weight.
[01:45:58.651 --> 01:46:01.113]  Whatever is doing to me metabolically is amazing.
[01:46:01.213 --> 01:46:02.794]  Let's see what happens next week.
[01:46:09.497 --> 01:46:11.299]  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
[01:46:11.419 --> 01:46:13.140]  That all men are created equal.
[01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:16.843]  That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights.
[01:46:17.023 --> 01:46:20.146]  That among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:46:20.466 --> 01:46:27.252]  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[01:46:27.512 --> 01:46:36.640]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government.
[01:46:38.306 --> 01:46:39.827]  Independence isn't a day.
[01:46:40.087 --> 01:46:40.887]  It's a mindset.
[01:46:41.127 --> 01:46:43.769]  An attitude that says, I will not be your dependent.
[01:46:43.889 --> 01:46:45.209]  I will not be your slave.
[01:46:45.509 --> 01:46:51.052]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[01:46:51.572 --> 01:46:55.814]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave.
[01:46:56.535 --> 01:46:57.995]  Slaves are never safe.
[01:46:58.415 --> 01:47:00.737]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[01:47:01.417 --> 01:47:02.117]  Guard your liberty.
[01:47:02.517 --> 01:47:05.259]  Regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[01:47:05.879 --> 01:47:07.760]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:47:11.744 --> 01:47:15.848]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:16.368 --> 01:47:17.709]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:21.793 --> 01:47:23.314]  We are on the march.
[01:47:23.855 --> 01:47:26.097]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:47:26.737 --> 01:47:30.281]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:30.441 --> 01:47:33.083]  I'm waiting in my cold cell.
[01:47:41.142 --> 01:47:43.004]  Reflecting on my past life.
[01:47:47.067 --> 01:47:50.229]  Real advanced intellects can look forward and backward in the future.
[01:47:52.750 --> 01:47:57.994]  And they know that the time for me is running low.
[01:47:58.014 --> 01:48:02.037]  Let's crank this up.
[01:48:03.238 --> 01:48:05.019]  Sands of time for all of us.
[01:48:06.059 --> 01:48:06.700]  Individually.
[01:48:07.492 --> 01:48:08.233]  ...are running low.
[01:48:09.794 --> 01:48:16.278]  But for the species, if we survive, the sands run on for eternity.
[01:48:16.418 --> 01:48:19.260]  And we are so close to that mark.
[01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:19.780]  So close.
[01:48:22.001 --> 01:48:22.782]  Running low.
[01:48:22.802 --> 01:48:25.503]  I'll be back tomorrow.
[01:48:25.563 --> 01:48:27.725]  By the way, we're gonna take some more phone calls.
[01:48:27.745 --> 01:48:27.845]  11 a.m.
[01:48:27.885 --> 01:48:28.305]  to 3 p.m.
[01:48:28.365 --> 01:48:30.006]  Central, with a weekday transmission.
[01:48:31.387 --> 01:48:35.790]  And to say InfoWars is hitting on all cylinders is, uh, putting it lightly.
[01:48:36.915 --> 01:48:40.876]  I have pushed so hard, I have seen everything we've prayed for and worked for come true.
[01:48:40.896 --> 01:48:43.437]  I want to thank you, the listeners, for making it all possible.
[01:48:44.217 --> 01:48:55.520]  We're not out of the woods, as I said earlier, but we are really seeing that we can affect change, we can come together, we can challenge the lies and the intimidators, and that mainstream media isn't all powerful.
[01:48:57.220 --> 01:49:01.941]  What matters is, is what you stand for, what you do, what you say, what you speak.
[01:49:04.242 --> 01:49:04.602]  Briefly,
[01:49:06.107 --> 01:49:09.749]  We are having a sale that ends, finally, it will end today, will not be there tomorrow.
[01:49:09.789 --> 01:49:13.831]  Free shipping, store-wide, infowarestore.com, at 30 to 40% off.
[01:49:14.212 --> 01:49:25.418]  High-quality storable foods, the high-quality supplements that are just amazing, non-GMO heirloom seeds, massive discounts on ProGun apparel, Molon Labe.
[01:49:25.898 --> 01:49:33.222]  You're the ones making it all possible, bucking the system, bucking the curb, funding an operation, we'll tell the truth, that is now kicking butt.
[01:49:33.242 --> 01:49:34.283]  Now, I mean, look,
[01:49:35.242 --> 01:49:39.727]  Mainstream media, CNN was down to basically 15 million viewers a day.
[01:49:40.047 --> 01:49:42.970]  Their smaller shows 100,000 viewers, their bigger shows a million viewers.
[01:49:43.671 --> 01:49:48.036]  We were having 20 million views a day just on different videos a month ago.
[01:49:48.516 --> 01:49:50.338]  And Threshold Radio, 5 million viewers a day.
[01:49:50.439 --> 01:49:52.301]  So the average day was 25-30 million viewers.
[01:49:53.922 --> 01:49:55.744]  In a week, just six months ago, it was 30 million.
[01:49:57.739 --> 01:50:03.443]  80-something million last week just on video views, and just 5 million today on the radio.
[01:50:03.503 --> 01:50:05.444]  Just one of the biggest media events in the world.
[01:50:05.504 --> 01:50:09.347]  I mean, we're definitely bigger than Rush Limbaugh, which I don't go, I'm bigger than Rush Limbaugh, that's great.
[01:50:10.127 --> 01:50:11.308]  The point is, is that we are.
[01:50:11.328 --> 01:50:14.750]  You know, total reach in what we're doing.
[01:50:16.711 --> 01:50:18.252]  And we're going to get bigger, because I want to win.
[01:50:18.313 --> 01:50:18.753]  That's nothing.
[01:50:20.034 --> 01:50:24.877]  It's because of you supporting us, so thank you for your support, your prayers, sending our videos out, our articles out.
[01:50:24.957 --> 01:50:33.802]  You are the InfoWars, so no matter what color you are or where you came from, whether you're in England or Russia or Mexico or some place in the continent of Africa or wherever you are, I love you.
[01:50:33.822 --> 01:50:36.124]  I want you to have a great future and I want us to work together.
[01:50:36.744 --> 01:50:37.865]  So thank you for the support.
[01:50:38.365 --> 01:50:42.848]  We've got great products that you need, from BioPCA to Knockout to
[01:50:47.205 --> 01:51:03.659]  Alex, I'm so glad you picked me right after that introduction there where you're speaking about the things that we have accomplished.
[01:51:03.719 --> 01:51:05.140]  I wanted to reflect a little bit.
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:11.245]  I've been listening to you since 2004 when I first ordered martial law 9-11 rise of the police state.
[01:51:11.969 --> 01:51:15.490]  And it woke up tremendously with you and your videos since then.
[01:51:16.370 --> 01:51:26.172]  Um, I've passed them out from Little Rock to Orlando, left them on windshields of cars, and my wife tracking me down said, get out of there, get away from there, but I've done it.
[01:51:26.192 --> 01:51:30.492]  You were the original, you folks spreading our films before the internet even spread stuff viral, you did it.
[01:51:31.493 --> 01:51:33.533]  That's right, and I'm so, I'm so thrilled to be here.
[01:51:33.553 --> 01:51:35.033]  But do you see how long it took though?
[01:51:35.753 --> 01:51:38.994]  Like Force 10 from Navarone, they bombed the dam, it didn't blow up for 30 minutes.
[01:51:40.014 --> 01:51:41.535]  That's right, but you know what?
[01:51:42.135 --> 01:51:45.136]  We finally got here and we got a little beachhead like you've been saying.
[01:51:46.217 --> 01:51:56.442]  I just wanted to say that I'm just so thrilled to hear those numbers and that those of you that are out there listening, you've been a part of this and you've been helping the InfoWar.
[01:51:57.646 --> 01:52:01.770]  And we've finally got a beachhead, and that's something to be proud of.
[01:52:01.850 --> 01:52:02.911]  Well, I'll tell you the paradox.
[01:52:03.171 --> 01:52:09.176]  I know now why they've got to put billions a year from Carlos Slim, Mexican kingpins in the New York Times, and everything.
[01:52:09.196 --> 01:52:14.321]  Because listen, you'd think, the economy's so shot, you'd think with those listeners and viewers, we'd have extra money.
[01:52:14.921 --> 01:52:19.164]  We barely had more money come in per day than we did before with all this giant audience.
[01:52:19.184 --> 01:52:24.067]  What's crazy is, there's so much media now, audience doesn't even bring in money.
[01:52:24.148 --> 01:52:29.391]  So, we're successful audience-wise, monetarily we're not, which scares me for the economy.
[01:52:29.431 --> 01:52:30.212]  I mean, what does that say?
[01:52:31.585 --> 01:52:32.766]  Yeah, it says a lot.
[01:52:32.926 --> 01:52:37.047]  You know, there's been so many people, you know, I've been laid off twice since 2012.
[01:52:37.368 --> 01:52:44.030]  Brother, most of my family, college degrees, super successful the last ten years, had to sell their houses, and I understand.
[01:52:44.931 --> 01:52:45.391]  Exactly.
[01:52:45.451 --> 01:52:47.592]  So, we know the economy isn't like they told us.
[01:52:48.570 --> 01:53:02.254]  No, and speaking on that, I'd like for everybody to go out to InfoWars, to the store and to media and videos and look at the specials that they've got going on the video there.
[01:53:02.754 --> 01:53:04.275]  Several of them are $9.95.
[01:53:04.755 --> 01:53:08.196]  You can buy those and give them as Dirty Santa gifts.
[01:53:09.102 --> 01:53:13.186]  And just give them, you know, give them to people in your family that may not agree with you.
[01:53:13.826 --> 01:53:15.287]  And just say, you know, watch it.
[01:53:15.628 --> 01:53:16.689]  That's the thing about truth.
[01:53:17.289 --> 01:53:19.051]  Mountains of lies can be dissolved by that.
[01:53:19.071 --> 01:53:19.711]  Well, God bless you.
[01:53:19.751 --> 01:53:20.472]  I appreciate you, brother.
[01:53:20.492 --> 01:53:21.613]  Your check's in the mail for the plug.
[01:53:22.093 --> 01:53:23.274]  Yeah, we basically, uh...
[01:53:25.576 --> 01:53:29.457]  It's surreal, because I always wanted to just fight the New World Order.
[01:53:29.477 --> 01:53:30.538]  I thought it would be a small part of it.
[01:53:30.558 --> 01:53:32.138]  I didn't realize we'd be a dominant part of it.
[01:53:32.158 --> 01:53:38.500]  It is bizarre, but the praise goes to Christ, to you, to the listeners, I mean all of you, the crew.
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:42.802]  I mean, I'm just one small part of this, and it's very, very humbling, so thank you for the support.
[01:53:42.822 --> 01:53:44.582]  All right, Charles in New York.
[01:53:44.602 --> 01:53:45.883]  You're on the air, Charles, go ahead.
[01:53:47.045 --> 01:53:48.686]  Thank you very much for taking my call.
[01:53:48.766 --> 01:53:59.715]  I just wanted to tell you that there is a fundamentally important contribution that you can make to Donald Trump as he becomes President of the United States.
[01:54:00.315 --> 01:54:08.962]  I can look back on the last few weeks at the great analysis and distribution, message distribution that you and InfoWars and
[01:54:09.902 --> 01:54:15.688]  Drudge contributed along with Assange's verification and validation of many of the analyses.
[01:54:16.048 --> 01:54:20.773]  You had people like Molyneux, Sinek, Stone, Valenti, Watson.
[01:54:21.114 --> 01:54:25.298]  These were great contributors to the analysis and you did the distribution.
[01:54:25.618 --> 01:54:30.463]  And this is fundamental and for that I believe every historic in the modern media.
[01:54:31.445 --> 01:54:46.060]  Now the challenge that is facing Trump is that half of the population, or those that voted for Hillary Clinton, weren't really being given the reason why they should not vote for her.
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:47.061]  We're good to go.
[01:55:01.476 --> 01:55:07.860]  It's like he compromises to be nice to them because Hillary's saying be nice, but that's on the level, that's on a false level.
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:10.102]  Her surrogates are all saying attack, attack.
[01:55:10.122 --> 01:55:13.104]  That's why he has to point out, hey, you're still ordering this.
[01:55:13.384 --> 01:55:14.024]  They bust.
[01:55:14.104 --> 01:55:23.351]  We saw moveon.org funded buses, literally over 100 of them, bus people in from all over the state to riot in Austin the last three days.
[01:55:23.371 --> 01:55:26.893]  I mean, you've got to counter organize stuff like this and say it's organized.
[01:55:27.173 --> 01:55:29.475]  You're saying be nice, but you're not being nice.
[01:55:30.339 --> 01:55:30.639]  Yes.
[01:55:30.699 --> 01:55:31.840]  Analyze this for a second.
[01:55:32.060 --> 01:55:36.462]  What do you think 25,000, 30,000 people would turn out to see Donald Trump?
[01:55:36.882 --> 01:55:37.062]  Why?
[01:55:37.342 --> 01:55:40.844]  Because they couldn't reach him other than to go to see him directly.
[01:55:41.084 --> 01:55:44.526]  They would put their signs on the lawn and they would be destroyed.
[01:55:44.706 --> 01:55:46.126]  They would try to reach the media.
[01:55:46.146 --> 01:55:47.427]  They would be told, get off.
[01:55:47.747 --> 01:55:48.668]  They would not be given information.
[01:55:48.688 --> 01:55:51.509]  So they had to go to him to beat other people like themselves.
[01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:54.170]  And actually suppressing us is what made us stronger.
[01:55:54.590 --> 01:55:55.151]  Great points.
[01:55:55.191 --> 01:55:55.791]  God bless you.
[01:55:55.811 --> 01:55:56.431]  Amazing points.
[01:55:56.451 --> 01:55:57.452]  Yeah, we've got to figure out
[01:55:58.032 --> 01:56:01.577]  Because the average person thinking that Trump's a KKK member really means well.
[01:56:01.597 --> 01:56:07.787]  They have no idea that he got awards from the NAACP for hiring record numbers of blacks and Hispanics and others and promoting him.
[01:56:08.107 --> 01:56:09.450]  He doesn't care as long as you get the job done.
[01:56:10.615 --> 01:56:10.835]  I think?
[01:56:41.956 --> 01:56:48.438]  Yeah, based on your talks with Harris, how big of a landslide does it take to override the voting fraud algorithms?
[01:56:49.059 --> 01:56:58.563]  And secondly, the other two things you need to worry about with Trump is Electoral College voting fraud, because there's something called a faithless elector where they don't honor their pledge.
[01:56:58.683 --> 01:56:59.003]  That's right.
[01:56:59.023 --> 01:57:03.627]  They've already got Democrats 2 million signed to try to get the Electoral College not to honor him.
[01:57:04.067 --> 01:57:05.768]  But he's already president-elect.
[01:57:05.948 --> 01:57:07.069]  They would have challenged it earlier.
[01:57:07.129 --> 01:57:07.830]  I think he's in.
[01:57:08.490 --> 01:57:11.452]  But as for Bez Harris, she agreed about five states they tried to steal.
[01:57:11.492 --> 01:57:12.113]  They did steal.
[01:57:13.394 --> 01:57:19.078]  And so you add that together, he probably won by five, six million popular vote and 300 plus electoral votes.
[01:57:19.118 --> 01:57:20.639]  So they had to try to dampen that.
[01:57:20.679 --> 01:57:21.600]  But despite that, he won.
[01:57:22.557 --> 01:57:27.685]  Well, the last people to speak as strongly as Trump has has been John F. Kennedy and Reagan.
[01:57:28.045 --> 01:57:34.255]  They didn't get Reagan, but he actually backed off after they attempted to get him, so I'm really, really worried about a Trump assassination.
[01:57:34.615 --> 01:57:36.338]  I think that's the prime issue.
[01:57:36.398 --> 01:57:37.640]  They know he's playing nice.
[01:57:38.741 --> 01:57:41.404]  And they know he's got the military on his side, that's why they're standing down.
[01:57:42.546 --> 01:57:45.669]  But if they think they're gonna kill Trump and get away with it, everything's being watched.
[01:57:46.350 --> 01:57:49.714]  Look, they're scared, because the military and the police are away.
[01:57:50.595 --> 01:57:52.177]  This is a true battle for the Republic.
[01:57:52.517 --> 01:57:52.858]  Thank you.
[01:57:53.178 --> 01:57:53.899]  Great job, everybody.
[01:57:53.919 --> 01:57:54.500]  Thank you so much.
[01:57:54.540 --> 01:57:56.462]  Tomorrow at 11 AM Central, that's the kickoff.
[01:57:56.482 --> 01:57:56.882]  Spread the word.
