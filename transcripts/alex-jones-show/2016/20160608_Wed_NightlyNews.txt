[00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:22.423]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.503 --> 00:00:23.763]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:24.103 --> 00:00:27.924]  It is June 8th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:37.026]  Tonight, Muhammad Ali had his boxing title revoked when he was convicted of draft evasion.
[00:00:37.306 --> 00:00:39.866]  The conviction was later overturned by the Supreme Court.
[00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:46.508]  Now, Rand Paul has introduced the Muhammad Ali Voluntary Service Act to end the draft.
[00:00:47.228 --> 00:00:53.290]  Then, Hillary was pronounced the nominee by the AP even before voting began in yesterday's primaries.
[00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.212]  Today, Bernie is poised to lay off hundreds of staff members.
[00:00:57.952 --> 00:01:03.054]  And, from Dresden, Germany, FOR's live Bilderberg 2016 coverage.
[00:01:03.574 --> 00:01:08.396]  For 15,000 people to come here and protest the people who are against illegal migration, right?
[00:01:08.616 --> 00:01:14.138]  It's crazy that our government pays celery?
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.467]  Protester.
[00:01:17.487 --> 00:01:18.089]  Be brave!
[00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.320]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:37.697]  Buckley, tell us about Alexa Pure Breeze, discounted over 25% off as an introductory promotion.
[00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:39.038]  It's the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:01:39.178 --> 00:01:42.982]  It's an energy-efficient HEPA ion cluster air purification system.
[00:01:43.382 --> 00:01:45.805]  It has a four-stage purification process.
[00:01:45.945 --> 00:01:49.248]  It has a HEPA filter, pre-filters, and the carbon-activated filters.
[00:01:49.488 --> 00:01:58.971]  And the most amazing thing about it is that it has this patented ion cluster technology that kills airborne microbes with a final byproduct of clean water, not ozone.
[00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:10.674]  Because there's a lot of units out there that do that, that will sterilize the air, that will take out toxins and microbes, but you always come back into the room and you have that ozone smell, and as a matter of fact, if you leave a room sealed and you have one of those running... Toxin!
[00:02:10.854 --> 00:02:12.435]  It is toxic and it's kind of dangerous.
[00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:14.336]  So this is non-toxic.
[00:02:14.496 --> 00:02:15.577]  It's a beautiful unit.
[00:02:15.877 --> 00:02:16.717]  It really looks good.
[00:02:16.757 --> 00:02:18.679]  I mean, it will look beautiful in your house in a corner.
[00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.521]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, which operates as a fan.
[00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:23.501]  It's super quiet.
[00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:24.462]  It cleans the air.
[00:02:24.982 --> 00:02:27.624]  Every major room in your house really should have one of these.
[00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:41.113]  The cheapest equivalent unit costs $259.95 and there are other units that are up to $899 to $1,000 to do exactly what this unit does but they're not as quiet because this one has a silent mode which runs at 16 decibels.
[00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:46.636]  One thing that I encourage everybody to do is go and just look up online the toxicity of being inside all the time.
[00:02:46.876 --> 00:02:50.039]  In this current age, we're inside the vast majority of the time.
[00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.020]  Hardly do we ever get outside in the sun.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.282]  We're usually out inside doing something in our office or at home.
[00:02:55.643 --> 00:02:56.745]  Great job, Alexa Pure.
[00:02:56.966 --> 00:03:00.113]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com for all the nitroceuticals.
[00:03:02.366 --> 00:03:04.967]  We begin tonight with some breaking news out of Tel Aviv.
[00:03:05.527 --> 00:03:07.668]  At least four are dead in a Tel Aviv shooting.
[00:03:08.028 --> 00:03:15.111]  A Fox News producer in Jerusalem confirmed the death toll and said that five others were wounded and are in severe condition.
[00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:27.175]  A spokeswoman for the police said that there were at least two terror suspects and both were neutralized, meaning either killed or detained, and police are searching the area to make sure there are no other attackers.
[00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:31.920]  Now, of course, when you have stories like this, breaking news, developing news, the numbers can change quite frequently.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.764]  So we'll bring you the updates as they become available.
[00:03:35.224 --> 00:03:37.286]  But for right now, let's talk more about domestic news.
[00:03:37.847 --> 00:03:41.351]  Last night, Mrs. Clinton got a resounding victory over Bernie Sanders.
[00:03:41.391 --> 00:03:45.716]  Now, you can debate how legitimate that victory was, but it was a victory nonetheless.
[00:03:46.157 --> 00:03:46.898]  And it makes me wonder...
[00:03:47.478 --> 00:03:57.725]  For all the people who were feeling the burn over the past, I guess, year or so, going out there to these Bernie Sanders campaigns and doing all the things out there, are they satisfied with this outcome?
[00:03:57.745 --> 00:04:05.971]  Because as we pointed out last night, at least as the votes were last night, Mrs. Clinton pretty much hit a hole in one, not even dribbling into the cup.
[00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:10.334]  It's like dropping an ice cube into a big bucket and just got the exact number
[00:04:11.014 --> 00:04:11.514]  We're good.
[00:04:34.727 --> 00:04:43.280]  The primary is over except for D.C., a campaign source said, referencing next week's primary, and added that the dismissed staffers are getting severance.
[00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:48.809]  And one person who used to work for Sanders said it's more of the job ending as opposed to getting laid off.
[00:04:50.211 --> 00:04:52.472]  And they threw everything they could at Sanders.
[00:04:52.512 --> 00:04:55.774]  Of course, I wasn't a Sanders supporter, but I wanted to see the guy get a fair shake.
[00:04:56.415 --> 00:05:06.260]  And in the last days of pretty much his campaign, they've come out to the guy with everything they could, even going as far as to ask him if he was sexist for merely remaining in the race.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.801]  Somebody actually did this, I believe it was a New York Times reporter.
[00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:11.443]  They approached him and said, Mr. Sanders, is it sexist?
[00:05:11.823 --> 00:05:18.071]  For you to continue on in this campaign and go against Hillary Clinton, he's like, why should I have to give up my campaign?
[00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:21.034]  And beyond that, why is it sexist just because she's a woman?
[00:05:21.275 --> 00:05:24.338]  Just completely ridiculous standards as you go forward.
[00:05:24.358 --> 00:05:28.323]  And it would have been the same thing back when Obama was running against Romney or anybody else.
[00:05:28.664 --> 00:05:31.267]  They don't have to give up their campaign just because he's black.
[00:05:31.647 --> 00:05:39.355]  They have every right, even though I don't agree with their politics, to continue their campaign until they are crushed into the dust, as happened with Mr. Sanders.
[00:05:39.375 --> 00:05:47.604]  But it's not racist or sexist or bigoted in any way or fashion to continue your campaign just because your opponent looks different than you.
[00:05:47.684 --> 00:05:52.309]  So keep that for what it is, you social justice, self-righteous people.
[00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:53.690]  And that's just one
[00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:55.773]  ...about the Sanders campaign.
[00:05:56.054 --> 00:06:03.966]  Now one thing I did notice when we were out at the Sanders campaign, Joe Biggs was out there at the polling place trying to hear from the various Sanders supporters.
[00:06:05.046 --> 00:06:16.750]  There were no rocks being thrown, there were no riot cops, nobody was tossing barricades or lighting stuff on fire, and it was a very stark contrast to what we saw at Trump events.
[00:06:17.051 --> 00:06:25.814]  Now, of course, I'm talking to people who show up in protests of Donald Trump, and it doesn't even matter what you believe about the guy's politics, whether you love him, hate him, indifferent, whatever.
[00:06:26.474 --> 00:06:35.503]  Disagreeing with somebody does not allow you the right to go to their rallies and assault the police officers there or assault the supporters for said candidate.
[00:06:35.844 --> 00:06:44.953]  Case in point, what we've seen recently at the Donald Trump rallies, San Jose, where the lady went out there, she's wearing her Trump shirt, and somebody assaulted her, smashed an egg into her face.
[00:06:45.253 --> 00:06:48.497]  Now, I'm not a Hillary Clinton supporter, but if I go to a Hillary Clinton event,
[00:06:48.797 --> 00:06:51.318]  And I attacked a young lady by smashing an egg in her face.
[00:06:51.598 --> 00:06:53.759]  Are you guys going to sit back and say that was justified?
[00:06:53.799 --> 00:06:56.680]  That was completely rational behavior?
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.701]  No, you're not going to say that because that's criminal activity and it should be prosecuted as such.
[00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:03.262]  Just like what I experienced when I went out to Albuquerque.
[00:07:05.743 --> 00:07:08.584]  You guys know I don't like that stuff.
[00:07:12.785 --> 00:07:14.846]  Bro, you sent me on a freaking rock.
[00:07:14.946 --> 00:07:16.326]  What's your name, bro?
[00:07:16.366 --> 00:07:17.467]  You sent me on a rock.
[00:07:18.906 --> 00:07:32.906]  You guys hit me with a freaking rock.
[00:07:32.947 --> 00:07:35.150]  Now I got the tear gas in my mouth.
[00:07:49.721 --> 00:08:03.312]  Now the young man you see before you is not the person who hit me with a rock, but they're starting to round up these people who are going out there assaulting people, lighting fires, and doing all that craziness that you see at these riots and rallies and everything going on around the country.
[00:08:03.712 --> 00:08:05.734]  And some people are saying they're coming down too hard on this kid.
[00:08:05.754 --> 00:08:08.997]  They're charging him with felony charges for going after the officers.
[00:08:09.897 --> 00:08:11.479]  Honestly, I don't think that's going to stick.
[00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:14.241]  I think they're overcharging the kid, trying to get him to plead down.
[00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:16.683]  But regardless, you can take a look at this for yourself.
[00:08:17.435 --> 00:08:19.496]  APD says targeted their officers.
[00:08:19.936 --> 00:08:24.597]  So far, they've arrested three, including 14-year-old Marcus Griego.
[00:08:24.617 --> 00:08:31.079]  The commander actually witnessed Marcus throw a rock directly and hit the sergeant that was standing next to him.
[00:08:31.419 --> 00:08:37.301]  APD says this picture was taken after the rock was thrown and that officers confronted Griego.
[00:08:37.481 --> 00:08:42.542]  My understanding is that Marcus kind of laughed it off and kind of just pretended that it wasn't a big deal.
[00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:47.286]  Gregor is charged with two felony counts of aggravated battery on a peace officer.
[00:08:48.109 --> 00:08:53.492]  Earlier we were talking about how Bernie Sanders is having to lay off or let go of his staff, whichever way you want to look at it.
[00:08:53.853 --> 00:08:55.574]  And now we see that he's not the only one.
[00:08:55.614 --> 00:08:57.695]  This is going on all across the nation.
[00:08:58.195 --> 00:09:02.398]  Ralph Lauren, for one, they're looking to cut about 1,200 jobs.
[00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:06.601]  And this follows the layoffs of places like Macy's, Nordstrom's, and Walmart.
[00:09:06.621 --> 00:09:08.122]  Walmart was very surprising to me.
[00:09:08.542 --> 00:09:16.327]  And several other retailers, including Gap, Sears, JCPenney, have gone on to announce plans to shut down their facilities.
[00:09:16.767 --> 00:09:22.269]  Now, if you guys recall this video that happened, I guess a couple weeks ago, the guys were out going to these various rallies.
[00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.211]  And there's one thing in particular, this is like burned in my head of all the videos we've shot.
[00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:31.233]  It's this woman who owned a furniture factory, or she had some kind of furniture outlet.
[00:09:31.373 --> 00:09:33.214]  She hired movers and other people like that.
[00:09:33.474 --> 00:09:35.495]  And she was talking to this young girl, high school age girl.
[00:09:35.855 --> 00:09:37.256]  And the girl's like, why do I want to be a mover?
[00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:38.737]  Why do I want to move furniture around?
[00:09:38.937 --> 00:09:43.719]  Well, besides the fact it's a job, and if you don't like it, you can go be replaced by a robot working at Wendy's.
[00:09:44.119 --> 00:09:49.164]  But in this article, they say that home furniture and home furnishing retailers have actually added jobs.
[00:09:49.224 --> 00:09:54.990]  So, young lady out there, if you want a job, you may actually end up working at one of these furniture factory outlets.
[00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.813]  So, just keep that in mind as you go forward in your career.
[00:09:57.853 --> 00:10:00.095]  And of course, if you don't want to do that, start your own business.
[00:10:00.155 --> 00:10:04.399]  I think that'd be great, and I'd love to see more businesses started here in America.
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.863]  Now, one thing that's not great about the United States of America, we have
[00:10:09.301 --> 00:10:22.370]  Epidemic health crisis now there are many type of epidemics you got smoking epidemics drinking epidemics And now they're saying that we have a obesity epidemic and it's hit a new high They say overall 38% of u.s.
[00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:39.021]  Adults are obese and 17% of teenagers are two reports fine that's obese and it's medically defined as having a BMI body mass index of measure to height and weight that's more than 30 and This is the deal about this and before I go too deep into this
[00:10:39.822 --> 00:10:56.437]  Back when I was in high school they used to give us these tests too and we always laughed at them because you know guys who played sports you know I weigh about 10 pounds more than I did back when I was in high school but I was in high school I was in really good shape and basically they came back to me and said that according to this BMI this body mass index I was overweight.
[00:10:56.937 --> 00:11:02.441]  Which, you know, I was, you know, 5'11", whatever I was, you know, 180 pounds, you know, rock solid.
[00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:04.842]  And they're like, uh, the paper says that you're overweight.
[00:11:04.862 --> 00:11:08.585]  I'm like, well, the paper is stupid because I'm obviously not overweight.
[00:11:08.925 --> 00:11:10.466]  So take all this with a grain of salt.
[00:11:10.926 --> 00:11:15.109]  If you have, if you're going by this BMI, it's not exactly the most accurate thing on the planet.
[00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:16.970]  I know it's kind of the standard here in the States.
[00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:25.996]  So don't sweat it too bad if you're a little bit overweight, according to this, because it doesn't take into account things like, you know, body mass, body muscle and things like that.
[00:11:26.036 --> 00:11:26.157]  So.
[00:11:27.097 --> 00:11:27.757]  Keep that in mind.
[00:11:28.137 --> 00:11:30.658]  Now, another thing that you need to keep in mind is the FBI.
[00:11:30.998 --> 00:11:37.419]  Now, hopefully, the FBI, as we're talking about them at large, will do something about the Hillary Clinton situation.
[00:11:37.459 --> 00:11:44.060]  But regardless, we see Judge Andrew Napolitano telling Americans that they need to wake up to the FBI and their snooping laws.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.020]  It gets worse.
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.120]  It never gets better.
[00:11:47.321 --> 00:11:53.402]  No matter who's in the White House and no matter which party controls the Congress, the American people should wake up.
[00:11:53.762 --> 00:11:55.722]  This is a major step
[00:11:56.454 --> 00:12:02.298]  Far more egregious than the previous ones that have happened before this, which you and I have been talking about as you stay.
[00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:05.161]  This is a major step toward a police statement.
[00:12:05.181 --> 00:12:08.883]  It's done in the name of, it's always done in the name of, keeping us safe.
[00:12:09.244 --> 00:12:12.066]  Who or what will keep our liberties safe?
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.604]  Now this year we've had a string of very high profile celebrity deaths.
[00:12:16.624 --> 00:12:27.755]  We've seen David Bowie, Prince, Kimbo Slice just the other day, and of course, Muhammad Ali, you know, considered to be one of the greatest, not only boxers, but athletes of all time.
[00:12:27.775 --> 00:12:34.142]  One of the most outspoken and identifiable, iconic people of his generation, and rightfully so.
[00:12:35.242 --> 00:12:40.425]  And many people will identify with Ali, remember him for many reasons, and you're welcome to your reasons.
[00:12:41.286 --> 00:12:47.690]  I always remember his charisma, things of that nature, you know, how important he was to the black community, along with guys like Jim Brown.
[00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:49.171]  I actually got a chance to meet Jim Brown.
[00:12:49.591 --> 00:12:55.855]  Came here to Austin, I believe it was at LBJ's museum when I was supposed to see Obama, but the Secret Service didn't let me in because I wasn't, you know,
[00:12:57.002 --> 00:13:00.487]  Approved Secret Service, but not for nothing.
[00:13:00.567 --> 00:13:01.789]  Talk about Muhammad Ali.
[00:13:01.809 --> 00:13:04.794]  I think one of the best ways to remember Ali is to remember...
[00:13:05.942 --> 00:13:11.145]  One of the biggest political statements of his career, if not the biggest, is when he said, I'm not going to Vietnam.
[00:13:11.185 --> 00:13:13.687]  And he said this for a very profound reason.
[00:13:14.047 --> 00:13:18.970]  He said, basically, you can find the clips on YouTube, but he said, I'm not going to go fight in a war for a country that hates me.
[00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:22.172]  And of course, racial relations have gotten somewhat better.
[00:13:22.452 --> 00:13:26.535]  You wouldn't know this watching mainstream television, but they've gotten somewhat better since that time.
[00:13:26.975 --> 00:13:32.239]  But regardless of race, I don't think you should have to go fight in a war for any reason if you do not agree with that.
[00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:34.160]  I was talking to David Knight last night.
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.862]  And he said his parents, his grandparents, they went out and fought in World War II.
[00:13:38.122 --> 00:13:40.082]  And you cannot stop those guys from signing up.
[00:13:40.203 --> 00:13:40.403]  Why?
[00:13:40.443 --> 00:13:41.903]  Because they believed in the war.
[00:13:42.263 --> 00:13:46.445]  If people believe in a war, you don't need to have a draft or a selective service or anything like that.
[00:13:46.765 --> 00:13:48.386]  People will go volunteer for that war.
[00:13:48.746 --> 00:13:54.809]  But when I turn on the TV and I see, oh, we want you to go kill Gaddafi, who's just a regional threat.
[00:13:55.129 --> 00:13:55.590]  We're good to go.
[00:14:11.852 --> 00:14:16.293]  Man's military didn't use a drone to go blow up a wedding party in Pakistan or Yemen.
[00:14:16.553 --> 00:14:20.654]  I want you to go fly and blow up a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Afghanistan.
[00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:22.694]  Of course, I don't want anything to do with these wars.
[00:14:23.014 --> 00:14:25.194]  And that's why you see these guys come back in record numbers.
[00:14:25.515 --> 00:14:26.495]  They're on psych meds.
[00:14:26.535 --> 00:14:27.575]  They commit suicide.
[00:14:27.595 --> 00:14:32.036]  They have all these health defects because of psychological trauma, not just physical trauma.
[00:14:32.056 --> 00:14:32.976]  That's a whole other thing.
[00:14:33.276 --> 00:14:38.477]  But the psychological trauma that they have when they're told, hey, go to this village and kill everybody out there.
[00:14:38.857 --> 00:14:41.739]  Or deliver these people to be tortured like Joe Biggs had to do.
[00:14:42.159 --> 00:14:44.080]  Nobody wants to endure these type of things.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.721]  And people join for various reasons.
[00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:47.623]  Sometimes it's GI benefits or whatever else.
[00:14:47.943 --> 00:14:51.325]  But I think a great way to honor Muhammad is with Rand Paul's bill.
[00:14:51.745 --> 00:14:54.907]  It's called the Muhammad Ali Voluntary Service Act.
[00:14:55.227 --> 00:15:00.471]  And this will be presented to Congress in honor of the famed boxer who refused to serve in Vietnam.
[00:15:00.531 --> 00:15:03.733]  I think it's a very great way to honor Muhammad Ali's memory.
[00:15:04.369 --> 00:15:08.377]  Now before we go into a very shocking video featuring Alex Jones, I want to leave you with this.
[00:15:08.758 --> 00:15:13.106]  State police are now swiping motorist debit cards and prepaid cards to seize their money.
[00:15:14.167 --> 00:15:20.950]  It's called an ERAD, Electronic Recovery and Access to Data Machine, and state police began using 16 of them last month.
[00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:21.850]  Here's how it works.
[00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:28.973]  If a trooper suspects you may have money tied to some type of a crime, the highway patrol can scan any cards you have and seize the money.
[00:15:28.993 --> 00:15:31.594]  We're going to look for different factors in the way that you're acting.
[00:15:31.614 --> 00:15:42.458]  We're going to look for different, if there's a difference in your story, if there's some way that we can prove that you're basically falsifying information to us about your business.
[00:15:42.967 --> 00:15:50.210]  Now before we go on to our special reports, we're going to end with a very shocking video, a very shocking revelation, if we can pull it up on the Drudge Report.
[00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:58.994]  You see the golden goose, glowing golden girl, Hillary Clinton, and she is now being endorsed by none other than Alex Emerick Jones.
[00:15:59.014 --> 00:16:01.515]  I know this is a very shocking revelation for you people out there.
[00:16:01.535 --> 00:16:03.996]  You know, Alex has been supporting Trump.
[00:16:04.036 --> 00:16:06.817]  He has a Trump sticker right here, right here on his desk.
[00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:09.639]  You know, he was supporting Trump until recently here.
[00:16:10.419 --> 00:16:25.965]  I walked in earlier today and I saw Alex in this very studio, for lack of a better term, worshipping Hillary Rodham Clinton, and we had to have an intervention damn near an exorcism to get him off of the golden goose that is known as Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.346]  This is very disturbing footage.
[00:16:27.786 --> 00:16:30.687]  I do caution all of our viewers out there, but this is what it is.
[00:16:30.707 --> 00:16:31.668]  This is Teleprompter Free.
[00:16:31.688 --> 00:16:34.669]  This is what really happens here at TheInfoWars.com studios.
[00:16:43.046 --> 00:16:45.847]  Alright, now this is take one of the Second Amendment piece.
[00:16:46.007 --> 00:16:48.748]  Going to do a dry run here so everybody's good with the audio.
[00:16:48.768 --> 00:16:49.248]  Okay, let's start.
[00:16:49.689 --> 00:16:49.869]  Okay.
[00:16:50.529 --> 00:16:53.430]  Hillary Clinton is going to be your Democratic nominee.
[00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.071]  Now, Mrs. Clinton is a very conservative person.
[00:16:56.131 --> 00:16:56.511]  Travis!
[00:16:56.791 --> 00:16:58.372]  You guys, you gotta come help me, man.
[00:16:58.532 --> 00:16:59.532]  Alex is freaking out.
[00:16:59.673 --> 00:17:00.813]  I don't know what he's doing.
[00:17:00.873 --> 00:17:02.474]  I don't know what's going on.
[00:17:02.494 --> 00:17:04.494]  He kind of locked his mind or something.
[00:17:04.654 --> 00:17:05.855]  I've never seen him do that.
[00:17:12.773 --> 00:17:13.313]  I love her!
[00:17:13.353 --> 00:17:14.033]  She's my God!
[00:17:14.093 --> 00:17:16.614]  She's my God!
[00:17:17.914 --> 00:17:18.754]  I love her!
[00:17:18.954 --> 00:17:21.875]  She's a Goddess!
[00:17:22.175 --> 00:17:23.795]  Get a hold of yourself!
[00:17:24.015 --> 00:17:24.915]  Do it!
[00:17:24.955 --> 00:17:25.375]  Do it!
[00:17:41.932 --> 00:17:42.552]  No!
[00:17:42.712 --> 00:17:44.072]  You're wrong here, Evil!
[00:17:44.152 --> 00:17:44.913]  No, she's gone!
[00:17:44.953 --> 00:17:46.313]  I saw it on the drugs report!
[00:17:46.373 --> 00:17:46.593]  No!
[00:17:46.673 --> 00:17:47.593]  She's a goddess!
[00:17:47.613 --> 00:17:48.453]  She's saving us!
[00:17:48.473 --> 00:17:49.774]  She's in prison right here!
[00:17:50.054 --> 00:17:50.354]  Damn it!
[00:17:50.674 --> 00:17:51.674]  She needs to be in prison now!
[00:17:51.694 --> 00:17:52.594]  This church, Evil!
[00:17:52.634 --> 00:17:52.934]  No!
[00:17:52.994 --> 00:17:53.795]  No!
[00:17:55.795 --> 00:17:58.396]  Get away from me, racist!
[00:17:58.796 --> 00:17:59.776]  She's gone!
[00:18:00.376 --> 00:18:05.057]  He's gonna lose!
[00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:06.757]  He's gonna lose!
[00:18:07.217 --> 00:18:08.358]  You'll never stop me!
[00:18:09.178 --> 00:18:09.598]  Racist!
[00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:15.082]  This is what happens when people lose their minds.
[00:18:16.903 --> 00:18:20.205]  He's been infected by Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[00:18:20.785 --> 00:18:21.786]  Don't let this happen to you.
[00:18:21.806 --> 00:18:23.827]  Get your Hillary for Prison t-shirt today.
[00:18:24.487 --> 00:18:30.350]  Get your blasphemous Hillary for Prison t-shirt before Hillary outlaws them or Alex has them all destroyed.
[00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:34.893]  Go to store.infowars.com today and buy your Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[00:19:04.906 --> 00:19:09.309]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.091]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.773 --> 00:19:15.774]  And to look at that threat we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.435 --> 00:19:27.183]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type 1 civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.854 --> 00:19:39.220]  You could say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:50.126]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.
[00:22:47.091 --> 00:22:53.835]  Check out Brain Force today and other game-changing compounds like X2, Survival Shield, at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:54.116 --> 00:22:56.998]  Again, that's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:57.038 --> 00:23:08.225]  Alright, Rob Dew with InfoWars.com and we're live in Dresden, Germany.
[00:23:08.665 --> 00:23:11.207]  There's a group of seven or so
[00:23:12.929 --> 00:23:13.850]  You'd like to look at my bag?
[00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:14.531]  You're the next.
[00:23:14.971 --> 00:23:15.652]  Oh, I'm the next one.
[00:23:16.312 --> 00:23:17.994]  So I get to be part of the bag search now.
[00:23:18.875 --> 00:23:19.635]  What's going on?
[00:23:20.116 --> 00:23:22.438]  This is how they treat journalists.
[00:23:22.458 --> 00:23:22.898]  On the ground?
[00:23:23.178 --> 00:23:23.258]  Okay.
[00:23:23.278 --> 00:23:25.100]  I'm going to put this on the ground.
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:25.440]  Alright.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.141]  Here's my bag.
[00:23:38.288 --> 00:23:40.710]  It's got two pockets up at the top.
[00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.631]  There's a pocket here and then a pocket that opens up.
[00:23:45.573 --> 00:23:47.254]  Anyway, my bags are now being searched.
[00:23:48.014 --> 00:23:49.635]  I'm gonna look at my wallet.
[00:23:50.075 --> 00:23:50.976]  I got some money in there.
[00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:54.358]  Got some earbuds.
[00:23:54.838 --> 00:23:55.559]  Very dangerous.
[00:23:55.939 --> 00:23:57.320]  Very dangerous that you have earbuds.
[00:24:03.968 --> 00:24:04.908]  How are you guys doing tonight?
[00:24:05.329 --> 00:24:05.929]  Having a good time?
[00:24:05.949 --> 00:24:07.850]  Yeah.
[00:24:10.691 --> 00:24:27.539]  That's the company press pass and then that's attached to my... So this is Rob Duhem live streaming from Dresden, Germany where bags are being searched.
[00:24:29.379 --> 00:24:31.700]  The crime is walking 10 steps away from a
[00:24:37.054 --> 00:24:39.635]  Pull all the stuff that I've intricately packed into my bag.
[00:24:39.675 --> 00:24:40.135]  It's tape.
[00:24:43.877 --> 00:24:46.097]  Those are wet wipes and a battery.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.880]  They're meticulously going through my bag.
[00:24:54.721 --> 00:24:55.681]  Those are lens wipes.
[00:24:57.199 --> 00:24:58.760]  And some Velcro safety pins.
[00:25:01.001 --> 00:25:07.544]  Hey, to help me with my German vocabulary, what are safety pins in German?
[00:25:07.925 --> 00:25:08.785]  Sicherheitsnadeln.
[00:25:08.825 --> 00:25:09.766]  Sicherheitsnadeln.
[00:25:10.006 --> 00:25:11.046]  Alright, that's a good one.
[00:25:12.707 --> 00:25:14.288]  I love the long German words.
[00:25:14.728 --> 00:25:16.789]  I hear two safety pins right there.
[00:25:16.809 --> 00:25:17.750]  Can you put those back in?
[00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:21.032]  Sicherheitsnadeln.
[00:25:21.612 --> 00:25:23.253]  Sicherheitsnadeln.
[00:25:24.093 --> 00:25:25.634]  I'm working on my German right now, people.
[00:25:27.329 --> 00:25:32.974]  But yeah, we're here attempting to cover the secret meeting that is going on with Bilderberg.
[00:25:34.495 --> 00:25:35.396]  So that's going to open up.
[00:25:35.436 --> 00:25:36.016]  Let me show you this.
[00:25:36.036 --> 00:25:38.118]  This goes all the way around and then it opens up.
[00:25:38.158 --> 00:25:40.460]  Yeah, lay it flat and then you won't spill everything out.
[00:25:41.721 --> 00:25:44.964]  Yeah, I got a lot of stuff in there.
[00:25:44.984 --> 00:25:45.624]  Sunglasses.
[00:25:45.985 --> 00:25:46.405]  Flashlight.
[00:25:53.851 --> 00:25:56.293]  Those are foot pads for walking around all day.
[00:25:56.313 --> 00:25:57.314]  Those are really good too.
[00:25:57.374 --> 00:25:58.275]  I bought those in Italy.
[00:25:59.075 --> 00:26:00.456]  They're good when you have to stand around all day.
[00:26:00.697 --> 00:26:01.998]  That's to hold a cell phone.
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.581]  That is a cord.
[00:26:06.261 --> 00:26:07.983]  I'm just going all through it just so we all know.
[00:26:08.083 --> 00:26:11.606]  I have some throat lozenges in there when I have to scream.
[00:26:11.626 --> 00:26:13.187]  Ricola!
[00:26:13.587 --> 00:26:14.548]  Ricola!
[00:26:14.728 --> 00:26:15.429]  Ricola!
[00:26:15.629 --> 00:26:16.410]  That's a flask.
[00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.051]  It's a battery for charging.
[00:26:21.814 --> 00:26:22.655]  That's a microphone.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.741]  That is called the Super Zoom Camera.
[00:26:28.522 --> 00:26:31.524]  To get the faces of the globalists as they go in to plan our future.
[00:26:32.264 --> 00:26:32.504]  Right?
[00:26:32.724 --> 00:26:33.505]  They're gonna dictate.
[00:26:34.045 --> 00:26:36.166]  Now that's got a blade on it and that's got a pair of pliers.
[00:26:36.227 --> 00:26:37.127]  It's called a Leatherman.
[00:26:37.888 --> 00:26:38.568]  But it's a tool.
[00:26:40.269 --> 00:26:44.392]  And I got some cords in there.
[00:26:46.673 --> 00:26:48.474]  Some cuplinks.
[00:26:50.455 --> 00:26:51.336]  This'll be fun.
[00:26:52.336 --> 00:26:53.457]  I'll pack lighter next time.
[00:26:53.497 --> 00:26:54.678]  Those are memory cards in there.
[00:26:57.637 --> 00:27:01.780]  About 2,000 people watching this live right now.
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.243]  That's a camera and then there's my press pass.
[00:27:22.331 --> 00:27:23.312]  That's right.
[00:27:23.372 --> 00:27:24.133]  I'm like a German.
[00:27:24.153 --> 00:27:25.635]  I keep everything with me.
[00:27:26.035 --> 00:27:27.397]  I'm an engineer as well.
[00:27:28.098 --> 00:27:28.878]  Got all my tools.
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:30.921]  Tools of the trade.
[00:27:34.785 --> 00:27:35.485]  Fingernail clippers.
[00:27:35.525 --> 00:27:36.567]  Are those legal in Germany?
[00:27:37.347 --> 00:27:38.609]  We can carry fingernail clippers?
[00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:40.010]  Right?
[00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.671]  Fingernails?
[00:27:40.731 --> 00:27:41.552]  What do you say fingernails?
[00:27:42.096 --> 00:27:42.977]  Finger Noggin.
[00:27:43.357 --> 00:27:43.857]  Finger Noggin?
[00:27:44.317 --> 00:27:44.577]  All right.
[00:27:44.637 --> 00:27:45.738]  Finger Noggin.
[00:27:45.778 --> 00:27:47.139]  Finger Noggin.
[00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:48.940]  Noggin.
[00:27:50.041 --> 00:27:50.561]  Noggin.
[00:27:50.701 --> 00:27:51.181]  What's this?
[00:27:52.562 --> 00:27:54.523]  Oh, that is a clamp.
[00:27:54.783 --> 00:27:57.025]  For what?
[00:27:57.625 --> 00:27:58.045]  A clamp?
[00:27:58.105 --> 00:27:59.306]  To clamp anything.
[00:27:59.326 --> 00:28:02.628]  You know what I did with this before is I put it here and I clamped my hat to it.
[00:28:03.168 --> 00:28:07.451]  I was holding my hat right here when I went live on the air today to millions of people.
[00:28:07.471 --> 00:28:08.431]  That's all that is.
[00:28:08.931 --> 00:28:09.872]  You know, it just clamps things.
[00:28:11.753 --> 00:28:12.293]  That's awesome.
[00:28:12.533 --> 00:28:12.833]  Yeah.
[00:28:13.393 --> 00:28:13.994]  Press Pass.
[00:28:14.014 --> 00:28:14.214]  Austin.
[00:28:14.234 --> 00:28:16.074]  Have you ever been to Texas?
[00:28:16.574 --> 00:28:16.774]  No.
[00:28:17.294 --> 00:28:18.014]  It's a great place.
[00:28:18.074 --> 00:28:23.536]  We have things like the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment.
[00:28:24.736 --> 00:28:25.396]  It's good stuff.
[00:28:25.756 --> 00:28:26.336]  Am I good to go?
[00:28:26.696 --> 00:28:27.896]  Yes.
[00:28:28.717 --> 00:28:30.057]  You guys, you guys look young.
[00:28:30.077 --> 00:28:31.417]  You guys look younger than me.
[00:28:31.717 --> 00:28:32.457]  You're like 22.
[00:28:34.358 --> 00:28:35.618]  Looking young here, you guys.
[00:28:36.458 --> 00:28:37.398]  Alright, so I'm good to go?
[00:28:37.418 --> 00:28:38.479]  Yeah.
[00:28:38.819 --> 00:28:39.499]  Come with me?
[00:28:39.679 --> 00:28:39.919]  Yeah.
[00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.432]  Okay, because they're going to check the passport.
[00:28:46.793 --> 00:28:49.615]  And now I'm in the second depot here.
[00:28:49.635 --> 00:28:52.816]  There's Josh Owens, had his bag searched.
[00:28:54.297 --> 00:28:58.840]  Now they go through our passports and make sure we're good Americans, I assure you.
[00:29:00.641 --> 00:29:01.782]  Except he's a Canadian.
[00:29:03.263 --> 00:29:04.684]  That's Dan Dix right there.
[00:29:07.432 --> 00:29:08.233]  And what's your name again?
[00:29:08.253 --> 00:29:08.854]  Alex Poucher.
[00:29:08.935 --> 00:29:10.417]  Alex, and where are you from?
[00:29:10.457 --> 00:29:10.617]  St.
[00:29:10.657 --> 00:29:10.918]  Louis.
[00:29:11.018 --> 00:29:11.178]  St.
[00:29:11.218 --> 00:29:11.499]  Louis.
[00:29:11.839 --> 00:29:12.700]  You came down here for this?
[00:29:13.241 --> 00:29:14.123]  I live in Germany now.
[00:29:14.143 --> 00:29:14.744]  Oh, you live in Germany.
[00:29:14.844 --> 00:29:14.984]  Okay.
[00:29:15.004 --> 00:29:15.184]  Alright.
[00:29:15.645 --> 00:29:16.526]  You have a German girlfriend?
[00:29:16.787 --> 00:29:17.087]  I do.
[00:29:17.247 --> 00:29:17.468]  Okay.
[00:29:18.044 --> 00:29:20.086]  Yeah, she was translating there in the beginning.
[00:29:20.326 --> 00:29:22.508]  This young man over here was trying to see what was going on.
[00:29:22.748 --> 00:29:23.449]  What's your name, sir?
[00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.570]  I'm Alan.
[00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:25.731]  Alan, where are you from?
[00:29:25.871 --> 00:29:26.731]  I'm from London.
[00:29:26.811 --> 00:29:27.112]  London?
[00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:27.512]  Yeah.
[00:29:27.532 --> 00:29:29.454]  So you came here to check out the Bilderberg meeting?
[00:29:29.634 --> 00:29:30.034]  Yeah.
[00:29:30.314 --> 00:29:30.855]  Excellent.
[00:29:31.235 --> 00:29:35.839]  And yeah, so we're live streaming right now and just showing what's going on.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.282]  I've covered over a thousand protests in Europe.
[00:29:39.642 --> 00:29:40.982]  About eight German police cars.
[00:29:41.262 --> 00:29:47.924]  I think, hey, there's one German police car for each person that was walking up near the Bilderbergs.
[00:29:47.984 --> 00:29:49.144]  Watson, are you clear?
[00:29:49.544 --> 00:29:51.044]  I'm clear, for now.
[00:29:51.264 --> 00:29:55.045]  Watson doesn't have a bag, so that's white privilege.
[00:29:55.505 --> 00:29:57.166]  He's so privileged he doesn't have to carry a bag.
[00:29:57.206 --> 00:29:59.386]  Also, he's a male, so I say we arrest him anyway.
[00:29:59.426 --> 00:30:00.186]  F-ing white male.
[00:30:12.698 --> 00:30:23.631]  The police don't realize that their future is also being determined by this unelected cabal of criminals that are going to meet together and basically determine our fates.
[00:30:24.995 --> 00:30:26.917]  And the fact that the mainstream media is not covering.
[00:30:27.277 --> 00:30:31.800]  If 200 rock stars got together, there would be press everywhere, right?
[00:30:32.001 --> 00:30:34.342]  And you guys would be letting the press go wherever they wanted to.
[00:30:34.843 --> 00:30:40.828]  But 200 politicians get together in secret, and it's the end of the frickin' world if you want to put a camera on it.
[00:30:41.088 --> 00:30:44.270]  It is literally the end of the world in Dresden, Germany right now.
[00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:47.393]  We're witnessing it happen as we speak because we want to
[00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:52.513]  Show the fact that world leaders get together in secret to talk.
[00:30:52.533 --> 00:30:52.953]  You made it?
[00:30:53.033 --> 00:30:53.513]  You're good?
[00:30:54.014 --> 00:30:56.495]  Alright, Luke Grodowski has been cleared.
[00:30:57.096 --> 00:30:58.857]  Now we've got to go through the passport check.
[00:30:58.897 --> 00:31:00.298]  I know, passport check.
[00:31:00.618 --> 00:31:03.239]  And the blacklist and everything else that goes along with it.
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.842]  That is Jeff Burwick from the Dollar Bids Royal Enfee over there now being served.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.382]  So, Luke, Dave Cooley-Kirchner.
[00:31:12.543 --> 00:31:13.143]  Oh yeah.
[00:31:13.183 --> 00:31:14.805]  Oh, Watson just got a comment.
[00:31:14.845 --> 00:31:15.546]  Love Watson!
[00:31:15.586 --> 00:31:16.166]  There he is.
[00:31:17.368 --> 00:31:18.709]  He's getting the full search.
[00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:19.850]  You're live on Facebook.
[00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:20.371]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:20.391 --> 00:31:21.652]  I went ahead and Facebook mentioned this.
[00:31:23.194 --> 00:31:24.335]  Cool.
[00:31:24.375 --> 00:31:26.077]  We're only 2,000 people watching this.
[00:31:26.097 --> 00:31:28.580]  I think we're all mentioned right now.
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:29.621]  Yeah, pretty much.
[00:31:34.642 --> 00:31:37.924]  We have these young policemen who don't quite understand the people they're protecting.
[00:31:38.244 --> 00:31:45.508]  They've just been told what to do, so they're following orders and making sure the journalists get a good waxing.
[00:31:47.169 --> 00:31:49.450]  Probably because I'm German, they trust me more than you guys.
[00:31:50.911 --> 00:31:54.913]  Sorry, I know that's... Well, you speak good English for being German.
[00:31:55.153 --> 00:31:57.014]  Yeah, I lived abroad and now I live with students.
[00:32:00.453 --> 00:32:07.156]  So yeah, we're just over here at least 50, 100 meters from the Interalpen Hotel.
[00:32:07.176 --> 00:32:07.876]  50 meters.
[00:32:07.996 --> 00:32:09.777]  Yeah, at least 50 meters.
[00:32:10.017 --> 00:32:14.359]  They said to me if everything is fine we can actually walk there even for tomorrow.
[00:32:15.099 --> 00:32:17.920]  The only thing is to avoid the same procedure again.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.601]  We should not go with more than five people.
[00:32:20.481 --> 00:32:21.221]  Five people now.
[00:32:21.401 --> 00:32:25.462]  So it was 15?
[00:32:26.063 --> 00:32:27.163]  Just to have less trouble.
[00:32:27.503 --> 00:32:28.583]  Of course they can forbid it.
[00:32:28.803 --> 00:32:34.505]  You know, there's going to be a big protest over at the Caesar statue tomorrow.
[00:32:34.665 --> 00:32:35.785]  At least.
[00:32:35.805 --> 00:32:41.227]  The problem is, when we follow 15 people, then there are 16, or whatever, how many people follow them.
[00:32:41.267 --> 00:32:49.449]  I tried to explain it to them, and also as a press study, we should have the kind of immunity, because we're not participating, but observing or reporting about it.
[00:32:50.422 --> 00:32:51.743]  I think press is being treated twice as bad.
[00:32:51.764 --> 00:32:59.411]  It was explained to me that that will be the problem and in the decision of the police head of that unit.
[00:33:02.354 --> 00:33:04.757]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important
[00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:06.546]  I think?
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.
[00:33:57.342 --> 00:34:05.626]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, when products are sold out, you're unable to get them, sometimes for months, but we hold back the products for people that have already signed up for AutoShip.
[00:34:06.286 --> 00:34:17.391]  When you choose AutoShip before checkout on your order at Infowarshore.com, we'll give you 10% off and give you guaranteed delivery of out-of-stock products that are on your AutoShip list.

[00:34:21.033 --> 00:34:28.437]  Listers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products when you need them each month.
[00:34:29.474 --> 00:34:30.494]  Now it's finally here.
[00:34:30.954 --> 00:34:34.455]  AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:34:34.775 --> 00:34:35.255]  It's easy.

[00:34:42.937 --> 00:34:49.699]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, it's a sure win.
[00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:53.400]  You add to that free shipping on orders of $50, it is a can't lose.

[00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:04.155]  That's InfoWarsTore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:04.719 --> 00:37:05.779]  Alright guys, did you get beat?
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:07.640]  You look okay.
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:08.741]  Looked like nothing happened.
[00:37:08.781 --> 00:37:09.721]  No, nothing happened.
[00:37:09.781 --> 00:37:12.742]  I mean, we just stayed there to see what we could do and how far we could get.
[00:37:13.583 --> 00:37:19.925]  We heard there were some Bilderbergers in the lobby, so we went downstairs to try to talk to them.
[00:37:20.525 --> 00:37:28.829]  One of the security ladies who has been following me around taking photos of me throughout the last couple days actually spotted me and that's when
[00:37:29.409 --> 00:37:35.511]  These wonderful gentlemen came up and we're kind of flabbergasted and shocked but we're live-streaming right now.
[00:37:35.751 --> 00:37:36.031]  Excellent.
[00:37:36.051 --> 00:37:46.034]  We're gonna have the video up on youtube.com forward slash wearechanged and Dix is gonna have it up, Lauren Savage is gonna have it up and yeah I mean let these guys talk.
[00:37:46.094 --> 00:37:48.454]  I wonder if they're going to mess with our car right now.
[00:37:48.534 --> 00:37:50.995]  I didn't move it quite off the property so let's see what happens.
[00:37:51.015 --> 00:37:55.116]  Lauren, were you fearful at all for your safety or well-being?
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.941]  Was I fearful for my safety?
[00:37:57.001 --> 00:38:03.545]  Well, I was a bit worried that we were going to be sacrificed by the Bilderbergers since we stayed up to 12, but we managed to survive.
[00:38:03.565 --> 00:38:06.646]  But yeah, they were freaked out when they saw us in there.
[00:38:06.666 --> 00:38:08.567]  They were like, how did we let this happen?
[00:38:08.928 --> 00:38:10.428]  There are people that should not be there.
[00:38:10.448 --> 00:38:12.089]  They came up and asked, where are you from?
[00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.530]  Where are you from?
[00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:13.810]  And I'm like, oh, I'm from Canada.
[00:38:15.191 --> 00:38:17.012]  I don't speak jive!
[00:38:17.512 --> 00:38:18.632]  No, no, where'd you come from?
[00:38:20.233 --> 00:38:21.333]  Are you checking out, right?
[00:38:21.353 --> 00:38:22.873]  And then we're like, oh, we haven't checked out yet.
[00:38:22.913 --> 00:38:24.234]  Just absolute panic.
[00:38:24.294 --> 00:38:29.375]  The girl, the girl was watching him, walked by them, walked right back to get security.
[00:38:29.535 --> 00:38:29.916]  Yeah.
[00:38:30.176 --> 00:38:31.776]  But then I was like, where's coffee?
[00:38:31.816 --> 00:38:32.837]  I want some coffee now.
[00:38:32.937 --> 00:38:33.217]  Yeah.
[00:38:33.237 --> 00:38:34.197]  Can we have some coffee?
[00:38:34.217 --> 00:38:36.518]  And they're like, no!
[00:38:36.878 --> 00:38:38.498]  I'm like, I just want some coffee.
[00:38:38.518 --> 00:38:39.619]  Your coffee is really good here.
[00:38:39.639 --> 00:38:40.619]  Can we please have some?
[00:38:41.035 --> 00:38:43.617]  And they're like, oh no possible sir, no!
[00:38:43.637 --> 00:38:45.077]  See, they're under a paradox right now.
[00:38:45.137 --> 00:38:51.901]  They have to be nice and be respectful to people, but then also they have this impending doom of something they can't talk about that's coming.
[00:38:52.222 --> 00:38:52.982]  They don't want to talk about it.
[00:38:53.002 --> 00:38:56.724]  We tried talking to them at the front desk, and they just weren't interested in having a conversation.
[00:38:56.764 --> 00:39:01.547]  No, the lady at the front desk literally, like she's like, okay, you have to go, you have to go!
[00:39:01.567 --> 00:39:04.249]  Like started pushing the roundabout door.
[00:39:04.809 --> 00:39:07.891]  So we just get out of there and she did it in like the most fakest, most
[00:39:10.334 --> 00:39:19.060]  You don't get that panicked.
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.462]  You don't get that freaked out.
[00:39:20.482 --> 00:39:21.102]  For no reason.
[00:39:21.382 --> 00:39:23.884]  Unless, like honestly, they looked like scared.
[00:39:23.944 --> 00:39:24.865]  Scared for their jobs.
[00:39:25.025 --> 00:39:28.128]  Scared for... This is a demerit.
[00:39:28.468 --> 00:39:29.208]  Oh absolutely.
[00:39:29.529 --> 00:39:32.211]  You don't see people with that look in their eyes very often.
[00:39:33.035 --> 00:39:41.099]  Rob, you're reporting for InfoWars.com in Dresden, Germany, outside the Hotel Kibnitzky, Taschenberg Palais, where Bilderberg 2016 is taking place.
[00:39:41.119 --> 00:39:45.941]  And I'm standing next to a fellow journalist, alternative blogger, Manfred Petrich.
[00:39:45.961 --> 00:39:46.662]  How are you doing today?
[00:39:46.962 --> 00:39:47.682]  Fine, great.
[00:39:47.742 --> 00:39:48.983]  Nice to see you guys again.
[00:39:49.591 --> 00:39:51.553]  Well, we're always here.
[00:39:51.954 --> 00:39:54.136]  It's an alternative media circus.
[00:39:54.577 --> 00:40:00.664]  We don't have all the big trucks, all the fancy gear, but we're still out here getting the intel and making the confrontations.
[00:40:01.025 --> 00:40:03.568]  Who are you surprised is going to be here this year?
[00:40:04.639 --> 00:40:09.161]  Well, I'm surprised that, for instance, Klaus Schwab from the WEF is here.
[00:40:09.461 --> 00:40:13.083]  You know, the organizer of the Davos meeting is here.
[00:40:13.143 --> 00:40:18.945]  That's a sign also that the highest member of the Swiss Parliament is here.
[00:40:19.606 --> 00:40:27.229]  Then, of course, there are so many other people like Breedlove, the general supreme commander, who is on his way out.
[00:40:27.329 --> 00:40:29.050]  Maybe he's looking for a job or something.
[00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.230]  There you go, yeah.
[00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:32.331]  This is a good networking situation for these elitists.
[00:40:32.371 --> 00:40:33.452]  Like betrayers, you know.
[00:40:33.792 --> 00:40:35.133]  Petraeus is unemployed.
[00:40:37.274 --> 00:40:40.076]  A lot of what's being said, I'm concerned that Lindsey Graham's here.
[00:40:40.276 --> 00:40:49.202]  He's a sitting senator, which you normally don't see a sitting senator at a Bilderberg meeting unless I guess you're Hillary Clinton back in 2008 who secretly came to the meeting unannounced.
[00:40:49.362 --> 00:40:50.383]  Do you think Merkel's going to show up?
[00:40:50.805 --> 00:40:51.906]  No, I don't think so.
[00:40:52.267 --> 00:41:02.597]  But because she's on her way out, I think the reason why the three German ministers are coming is because maybe they will select who will follow her.
[00:41:02.617 --> 00:41:03.498]  Her successor?
[00:41:03.638 --> 00:41:03.958]  Yeah.
[00:41:04.479 --> 00:41:06.961]  And it could be von der Leyen, the defense minister.
[00:41:06.981 --> 00:41:09.083]  I mean, there are some rumors about that.
[00:41:10.287 --> 00:41:16.573]  And it looks as if the police are now arriving into the area inside the cordoned off concrete zone.
[00:41:16.854 --> 00:41:19.316]  Not a big zone, not as big as last year in Telfs.
[00:41:19.756 --> 00:41:20.497]  A big contrast.
[00:41:20.838 --> 00:41:25.462]  That's right, but remember at the same time, or just the day before, was a G7.
[00:41:26.343 --> 00:41:30.147]  That's why they were very kind of security aware.
[00:41:30.667 --> 00:41:31.949]  You know, they were freaking out.
[00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:33.090]  Right, that's right.
[00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:35.632]  That's what we said, and that's the videos we shot.
[00:41:35.652 --> 00:41:39.976]  Last year they cordoned off 10 kilometers and closed roads.
[00:41:40.557 --> 00:41:45.221]  That's why I'm surprised that they're doing it in the middle of a city where they can't do that that much.
[00:41:45.281 --> 00:41:47.323]  And you see how many tourists are running around?
[00:41:47.343 --> 00:41:49.265]  But they're obviously unaware.
[00:41:49.305 --> 00:41:49.846]  Look at these people.
[00:41:49.886 --> 00:41:51.467]  They have no idea what's going on right now.
[00:41:52.408 --> 00:41:57.769]  This is our friend Helmut, who we did an interview with a couple days ago, and it got a lot of views.
[00:41:57.789 --> 00:41:59.709]  A lot of people were interested in what you had to say about Bilderberg.
[00:41:59.729 --> 00:42:04.050]  A lot of people were impressed with the knowledge that you had and the anger that you showed.
[00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:08.411]  Even though you're very subdued, people were like, oh boy, he really gets mad there at the end.
[00:42:08.431 --> 00:42:09.531]  He doesn't like those globalists.
[00:42:10.471 --> 00:42:14.792]  And so after we did that interview, you then pulled out a piece of paper and showed it to me.
[00:42:14.832 --> 00:42:16.752]  Let's pull that out and let's show it to the people.
[00:42:18.073 --> 00:42:20.693]  And tell people what it is and what they're looking at.
[00:42:21.129 --> 00:42:23.051]  Yes, it was from last time.
[00:42:23.071 --> 00:42:30.298]  We just had some sheets with us to give the people some information about Bilderbergers.
[00:42:31.879 --> 00:42:35.163]  Nothing special, just common information about Bilderbergers.
[00:42:36.244 --> 00:42:43.090]  We were stopped from police and they took away all the sheets and
[00:42:43.911 --> 00:42:45.913]  And when you say sheets, you're talking about flyers, right?
[00:42:45.933 --> 00:42:46.874]  We call them flyers.
[00:42:46.995 --> 00:42:48.096]  Flyers, flyers.
[00:42:49.137 --> 00:42:52.761]  And just double-sided information about billiards.
[00:42:53.842 --> 00:42:57.707]  And, well, of course, they banned me from the square.
[00:42:58.948 --> 00:43:03.031]  And that's a shit, I just have my thumb on my address, yeah?
[00:43:03.051 --> 00:43:03.531]  Sure, sure, that's fine.
[00:43:03.571 --> 00:43:08.275]  Just for... I don't like Billaburgers here, I don't like them at home.
[00:43:08.395 --> 00:43:08.855]  Exactly.
[00:43:09.375 --> 00:43:12.117]  Well, read to the people what it says, because most of the people here speak German.
[00:43:12.177 --> 00:43:21.424]  Well, it means, in German it's Ordnungswidrigkeit, this means some lower crime.
[00:43:22.604 --> 00:43:24.486]  Against the Saxonian
[00:43:25.998 --> 00:43:28.921]  The media law.
[00:43:32.645 --> 00:43:41.033]  So they put all the flyers, and I will get not only this ticket, but some letter in a few weeks or some days.
[00:43:42.254 --> 00:43:42.995]  Well, I don't care.
[00:43:44.196 --> 00:43:45.817]  I make it like... How was it?
[00:43:46.237 --> 00:43:46.898]  Ellis Presley?
[00:43:47.218 --> 00:43:47.418]  Yeah.
[00:43:47.699 --> 00:43:48.719]  Return to sender.
[00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:50.241]  Address unknown.
[00:43:50.281 --> 00:43:50.881]  Something like this.
[00:43:51.262 --> 00:43:53.303]  Well, yes.
[00:43:54.364 --> 00:43:55.125]  And that's a ticket.
[00:43:55.425 --> 00:43:55.645]  Yeah.
[00:43:55.985 --> 00:43:58.167]  So you got a ticket for passing out flyers.
[00:43:58.207 --> 00:43:59.228]  You essentially got ticketed.
[00:43:59.288 --> 00:43:59.768]  That's right.
[00:43:59.949 --> 00:44:01.610]  And they also banned me from the square.
[00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:02.851]  Yeah.
[00:44:03.391 --> 00:44:06.194]  But they've been very polite, yeah?
[00:44:06.674 --> 00:44:06.974]  Oh, yeah.
[00:44:07.014 --> 00:44:07.955]  They were friendly.
[00:44:07.975 --> 00:44:08.555]  Here's a ticket.
[00:44:08.636 --> 00:44:09.216]  This is polite.
[00:44:10.417 --> 00:44:10.977]  Yeah, but they...
[00:44:11.938 --> 00:44:28.181]  They really said, one policeman said, I'm very sorry, but we are instructed from local government to watch very closely, clearly everything because of this event here in Taschenberg.
[00:44:29.026 --> 00:44:29.907]  What's the name of this paper?
[00:44:30.147 --> 00:44:32.729]  Sächsische Zeitung from today.
[00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:42.577]  And here you can read 15,000 anti-fascist action.
[00:44:42.858 --> 00:44:45.220]  Anti-fascist is another name for leftists, right?
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:45.580]  Yes.
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:46.701]  People who don't really have jobs?
[00:44:47.141 --> 00:44:49.023]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:49.403 --> 00:44:50.864]  But they get Antifa.
[00:44:51.405 --> 00:44:55.148]  They get money per hour, about 45 Euro.
[00:44:56.829 --> 00:44:57.429]  That's pretty nice.
[00:44:57.590 --> 00:45:00.771]  Yeah, and for eating and for the bus transfer.
[00:45:01.192 --> 00:45:08.636]  So they're paying for 15,000 people to come here and protest the people who are against illegal migration, right?
[00:45:09.997 --> 00:45:15.721]  What they did in the real... Maybe not every person gets the money.
[00:45:15.801 --> 00:45:16.621]  I don't know.
[00:45:16.741 --> 00:45:17.722]  The leaders do.
[00:45:17.962 --> 00:45:23.966]  But it's crazy that our government pays
[00:45:25.498 --> 00:45:25.918]  Salary?
[00:45:26.278 --> 00:45:27.059]  Yeah.
[00:45:27.099 --> 00:45:27.579]  Protesters.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:29.840]  And we pay.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.101]  It's like the election.
[00:45:32.601 --> 00:45:40.725]  The election, many, many posters, many, many information in the news or newspaper, and we pay.
[00:45:41.585 --> 00:45:46.167]  That we make a cross, write a cross for a special
[00:45:47.385 --> 00:45:49.208]  I think so.
[00:46:02.265 --> 00:46:08.928]  Ask people here in Dresden, in the restaurants, and I said, yes, what do you know what is happening?
[00:46:09.288 --> 00:46:19.073]  And today in the morning, one man from a restaurant said, yeah, today in the newspaper, you can read 15,000 will come.
[00:46:19.233 --> 00:46:20.333]  And I said, what?
[00:46:20.954 --> 00:46:22.414]  And yes, yes, yes, in newspaper.
[00:46:22.454 --> 00:46:22.995]  And therefore I
[00:46:23.775 --> 00:46:39.664]  I want a newspaper, and I saw in the Google, I was searching about Billeberg and a demonstration tomorrow, and then I found the local TV, MDR.
[00:46:40.764 --> 00:46:50.429]  And then, as you can see in the internet, the demonstrations, the legal demonstrations, the police knows.
[00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:52.451]  Okay, so this will be a legal demonstration.
[00:46:52.511 --> 00:46:52.791]  Yes.
[00:46:53.511 --> 00:46:53.872]  Yeah.
[00:46:53.892 --> 00:46:58.035]  So there's always a way around the rules when you want to create some sort of weird atmosphere.
[00:46:58.075 --> 00:46:59.376]  Yeah, it's a democracy.
[00:46:59.416 --> 00:47:00.217]  We have democracy.

[00:47:07.593 --> 00:47:09.796]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.896 --> 00:47:16.702]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:47:16.942 --> 00:47:20.226]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.246 --> 00:47:21.407]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.707 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.991]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.

[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:37.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.701]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:48:41.081 --> 00:48:46.583]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the InfoWar.
[00:48:47.023 --> 00:48:53.687]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.

[00:49:04.085 --> 00:49:05.726]  Our borders are wide open.
[00:49:05.967 --> 00:49:14.954]  Now that last sentence may generate a collective yawn among a large swath of Americans, and some Americans may even consider that sentiment to be racist.
[00:49:15.154 --> 00:49:25.202]  But their undivided attention on the matter of our open border may soon be met with an electric jolt of yet another hidden danger slipping into the United States.
[00:49:25.542 --> 00:49:31.267]  It hasn't taken long for Obama's disastrous Iranian nuclear arms deal to grow legs.
[00:49:31.667 --> 00:49:33.669]  As a result, the Iranian government
[00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:46.161]  A supporter of the Shia militant group Hezbollah recently had $100 billion in frozen assets thawed, and now Hezbollah is growing exponentially in Central America.
[00:49:46.441 --> 00:49:55.770]  The House Financial Services Committee Task Force met on the Hill today to investigate the mushrooming threat of terrorism financing in Central America.
[00:49:55.990 --> 00:50:03.898]  It is clear to us by now that there was a complete lack of political will to fight money laundering and terrorist financing in Argentina during the last 12 years.
[00:50:04.799 --> 00:50:11.526]  There was a lack of strategic planning which prevented the government from prioritizing its efforts and making an efficient use of public resources.
[00:50:12.167 --> 00:50:16.711]  This in turn led to a serious lack of effectiveness with a related impact on risk levels.
[00:50:17.492 --> 00:50:28.664]  Throughout the last 10 years, the threats to financial integrity increased significantly, as criminals exploited the advantages of a sophisticated financial system with the vulnerabilities of an uncommitted government.
[00:50:29.471 --> 00:50:33.893]  One of the main structural vulnerabilities exploited by criminals in recent years was corruption.
[00:50:34.714 --> 00:50:41.577]  Corruption under the previous administration was the rule, not the exception, and corrupt officials were rewarded rather than punished.
[00:50:42.438 --> 00:50:46.340]  At our Financial Intelligence Unit in particular, the situation was also critical.
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:53.564]  The strategy was to have no strategy, which allowed for a discretionary use of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing tools.
[00:50:54.705 --> 00:50:58.048]  And you would you're saying that it's expanding it is expanding.
[00:50:58.088 --> 00:51:16.807]  Yes, sir It is expanding because it is making a conscious sustained well-funded effort to actually Reach out not just to the local Shia communities, which are mainly Syrian and Lebanese But it is actually reaching out to convert non-muslims to Shia Islam.
[00:51:16.827 --> 00:51:17.568]  You have the supreme leader
[00:51:17.568 --> 00:51:17.628]  Yes.
[00:51:32.702 --> 00:51:54.199]  Immigrants of Lebanese and Syrian descent the Iranians are focusing on the outreach missionary effort But they are combined most of the time they're overlapping in the same mosques in the same centers They're interacting there is a stream of very senior clerics coming from both Iran and Lebanon to visit on a constant basis and
[00:51:54.699 --> 00:52:00.662]  The Hezbollah representatives together with the Iranian ones are constantly cooperating on this effort.
[00:52:01.163 --> 00:52:13.930]  And this effort to a large extent is geared toward building support, galvanizing, so to speak, the troops, indoctrinating and radicalizing, and it is also designed
[00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:21.035]  As a facade for the financial activities which are managed in coordination.
[00:52:21.095 --> 00:52:24.998]  Hezbollah is not the same organization that they were 15 years ago.
[00:52:25.078 --> 00:52:26.599]  Just 15 short years ago.
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:39.589]  In the early 2000s, they began moving small quantities of cocaine from the tri-border area of Latin America into fledgling markets at that time in Europe and the Middle East.
[00:52:40.984 --> 00:52:55.644]  Flash forward to 15 years later, they're now moving multi-tons of cocaine into Europe to attempt to satisfy the ever-increasing demand for cocaine in Europe, in the Middle East, and other emerging markets.
[00:52:56.636 --> 00:53:06.302]  They possess a demonstrated ability to move, again, hundreds of tons of cocaine over that 15 year period and move massive amounts of currency.
[00:53:06.702 --> 00:53:17.770]  Hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of dollars in currency around the world in the most sophisticated money laundering scheme or schemes that we have ever witnessed.
[00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:27.847]  They have metastasized into a hydra with international connections that the likes of ISIL and groups like Al-Qaeda could only hope to have.
[00:53:28.584 --> 00:53:32.768]  But don't expect the Obama administration to provide any real answers.
[00:53:33.068 --> 00:53:34.169]  That would be a miracle.
[00:53:34.569 --> 00:53:42.776]  Instead, White House spokesman Josh Earnest has chosen to cover up statements he clearly made about the Iranian nuclear deal.
[00:53:42.916 --> 00:53:49.621]  Back in 2013, multi-million dollar terrorism financing is happening for a reason.
[00:53:49.942 --> 00:53:54.445]  And when they strike, the sheeple are going to beg for our borders to be closed.
[00:53:54.826 --> 00:53:56.447]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[00:54:02.418 --> 00:54:05.560]  Tim Kennedy was number two middle heavyweight.
[00:54:05.921 --> 00:54:06.981]  He's lived in Austin many years.
[00:54:07.001 --> 00:54:10.764]  He's been friends with my high school buddy Shane Steiner for many years, who folks know.
[00:54:11.705 --> 00:54:17.189]  And they're an old famous rodeo family and Texas family and our families go back some.
[00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:26.896]  Strange, even though when I met him in high school, when I moved down here, I didn't know my grandfather knew his grandfather and great-grandfather, Buck Steiner, but it's a small world.
[00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:28.951]  I was like, yeah, Tim Kennedy.
[00:54:28.971 --> 00:54:31.313]  So I started having dinner a few times, hanging out with him.
[00:54:31.333 --> 00:54:32.495]  They'd come by the office.
[00:54:32.835 --> 00:54:34.757]  We'd go over to the gym, watch him work out.
[00:54:34.857 --> 00:54:36.299]  Anthony started working out with him a little bit.
[00:54:36.339 --> 00:54:40.062]  These guys work out all over town for like twice a day, three hours a day.
[00:54:40.583 --> 00:54:42.164]  And then go out and shoot and do all the rest of it.
[00:54:43.191 --> 00:54:56.295]  And then I talked to some of my Army buddies and people I know that are retired or been in Special Forces, and they said, well, you know Tim Kennedy's been in more combat probably than even somebody like the legend Chris Kyle.
[00:54:56.736 --> 00:55:09.140]  And I didn't know those guys had been friends years in Iraq where the Army and the Marines worked with each other in Overwatch and Underwatch, Nighttime Watch, Daytime Watch, all this other stuff, and that they'd actually been in contact a lot.
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:10.961]  Tim Kennedy won't brag on himself.
[00:55:11.021 --> 00:55:21.568]  This guy, when it comes to being a sniper, right there with Chris Kyle, but only a legend in the Army, and when it comes to just all the things he's done, it's amazing.
[00:55:22.289 --> 00:55:26.271]  There's not just sniping, but commando raids, taking out top terrorists, you name it, he's been there.
[00:55:26.711 --> 00:55:35.998]  And now they try to train the military for gun confiscation and taking over capitals and checkpoints and martial law and all the rest of it, so that's really woken the military up.
[00:55:36.378 --> 00:55:37.839]  And Kennedy's not telling me any of this.
[00:55:37.859 --> 00:55:38.940]  I already know all this.
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:42.221]  It's public, but he said, yeah, folks are awake.
[00:55:42.261 --> 00:55:42.882]  Yes, it's true.
[00:55:47.684 --> 00:55:49.966]  I believe in dangerous freedom.
[00:55:51.766 --> 00:55:54.148]  I'll take dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery any day.
[00:55:54.928 --> 00:56:04.513]  The reason that I believe that is any other form of this construct of freedom can't materialize.
[00:56:04.553 --> 00:56:07.315]  It can't ever be substantial.
[00:56:08.945 --> 00:56:09.585]  Without risk.
[00:56:10.966 --> 00:56:19.529]  The part about being a libertarian, the part about being and understanding what individual responsibility means, there is some assumed risk that goes along with it.
[00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:24.551]  That's knowing that the government can't take care of me all the time.
[00:56:25.011 --> 00:56:27.152]  That's knowing that the government's not going to give me a free cell phone.
[00:56:27.532 --> 00:56:30.193]  That's knowing that the government is not going to give me food when I'm hungry.
[00:56:30.554 --> 00:56:34.015]  That's knowing that I have to take care of myself and my family.
[00:56:35.697 --> 00:56:36.418]  I believe in freedom.
[00:56:37.238 --> 00:56:42.642]  I believe that I should be able to say whatever I want, whenever I want, when it doesn't hurt somebody else.
[00:56:44.824 --> 00:56:46.685]  I believe in freedom of religion.
[00:56:47.406 --> 00:56:53.531]  I believe that there should be procedures when the government's going to come and search my home or want to get in my car.
[00:56:54.812 --> 00:56:59.335]  There's a reason that we had all these, you know, the Constitution and every one of those wonderful amendments.
[00:56:59.956 --> 00:57:05.320]  The only way that every single one of them can exist is because of the Second Amendment.
[00:57:07.762 --> 00:57:08.643]  You like freedom of speech?
[00:57:09.564 --> 00:57:12.528]  Well, you better like your right to bear arms.
[00:57:13.249 --> 00:57:14.631]  Because you can't have one without the other.
[00:57:15.572 --> 00:57:17.755]  The Second Amendment was not written for
[00:57:19.008 --> 00:57:19.648]  Hunting deer.
[00:57:20.389 --> 00:57:23.231]  You hear people say like, you know, they had muskets back then.
[00:57:23.271 --> 00:57:26.633]  There's no way that they could have imagined the type of technology that we have today.
[00:57:27.013 --> 00:57:28.214]  No, that's, that's malarkey.
[00:57:28.995 --> 00:57:30.296]  They knew what was coming.
[00:57:30.596 --> 00:57:31.897]  The founding fathers were brilliant.
[00:57:32.237 --> 00:57:33.077]  They were engineers.
[00:57:33.418 --> 00:57:35.979]  They weren't like the politicians of today that never had a job in their life.
[00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:38.041]  They actually did things for a living.
[00:57:38.141 --> 00:57:41.503]  When they wrote that constitution, there were already guns that were essentially Gatling guns.
[00:57:41.663 --> 00:57:44.045]  They knew that those type, that type of technology was coming.
[00:57:44.625 --> 00:57:48.728]  So when people are like, you know, do you really need a automatic weapon to go deer hunting?
[00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:50.971]  Do you know what?
[00:57:50.991 --> 00:57:52.032]  It wasn't written for deer.
[00:57:52.493 --> 00:58:01.064]  If the deer were going to then come and try to imprison me, and then search my home, and then take what's mine, then yeah, I need an AR-15 for deer hunting.
[00:58:01.344 --> 00:58:02.005]  But that's not the case.
[00:58:02.265 --> 00:58:03.407]  It was written for the government.
[00:58:03.767 --> 00:58:06.811]  It was written so that the people always have more power than the government.
[00:58:07.492 --> 00:58:08.733]  Now that preponderance has shifted.
[00:58:09.413 --> 00:58:14.695]  It has gone from the people being the ones that have the power, to now we're scared of the government.
[00:58:15.075 --> 00:58:17.856]  We have to go back to a dangerous freedom.
[00:58:18.156 --> 00:58:20.357]  That's where people have more power than the government.
[00:58:21.197 --> 00:58:22.258]  That is people having guns.
[00:58:22.678 --> 00:58:24.779]  That is people having better guns than the government.
[00:58:25.219 --> 00:58:26.079]  Yeah, it's scary.
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:34.903]  But last time we had somebody cruise into San Bernardino into a gun-free zone, two people, couple of guns, killed countless.
[00:58:35.828 --> 00:58:40.771]  Do you know what happened last time two people came into Texas to try to do the same thing?
[00:58:41.431 --> 00:58:42.792]  They didn't even make it out of their car.
[00:58:43.512 --> 00:58:44.173]  That's the difference.
[00:58:44.893 --> 00:58:46.734]  Dangerous freedom, we understand what the risk is.
[00:58:46.934 --> 00:58:47.714]  There's an assumption there.
[00:58:48.195 --> 00:58:51.537]  And I'll take that dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery any day.
[00:58:53.958 --> 00:58:55.259]  Well, that's it for our show tonight.
[00:58:55.319 --> 00:58:59.521]  I'm Jakari Jackson from the InfoWars Command Center, and we'll see you again tomorrow night.
[00:59:03.857 --> 00:59:05.018]  Knockout is back.
[00:59:05.358 --> 00:59:16.465]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep, restful sleep, Knockout's it.

[00:59:19.107 --> 00:59:28.192]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:28.573 --> 00:59:30.354]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:30.914 --> 00:59:31.795]  It's the same price
[00:59:32.515 --> 00:59:41.379]  As leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece, it has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult, and it just synergistically puts everything in there.
