[00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:22.240]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.301]  It is Friday, September 30th, 2016, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.522]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:44.108]  Tonight, as hackers across the country infect cameras, DVRs, and the Internet, security experts warn of an impending hack attack on our nation's voting systems.
[00:00:44.508 --> 00:00:46.729]  We are just as sick and tired of the corrupt
[00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:49.307]  That malicious system is the next person.
[00:00:49.327 --> 00:00:55.154]  The current democratic institutions are not only failing us, they're making our lives unbearable.
[00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:57.836]  Meanwhile, the dead live.
[00:00:58.497 --> 00:01:00.539]  And they are voting Democrat.
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.341]  Plus, the U.N.
[00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:07.106]  launches their very own propaganda campaign to stop Donald Trump.
[00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:12.270]  And Megyn Kelly tells Team Trump to just shut up.
[00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:19.077]  Why won't they just shut up about the women and how big they're supposed to be?
[00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.944]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:33.024]  Look, I'm not going to sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:01:33.284 --> 00:01:36.306]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:37.427]  Because it's already here.
[00:01:37.827 --> 00:01:38.467]  It's being announced.
[00:01:38.828 --> 00:01:42.290]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.051]  You don't let them break your will.
[00:01:44.692 --> 00:01:56.760]  Go to infowars.com forward slash app and download an app that took us over a year to develop that we're going to be expanding on the next few months with free video and audio and podcast feeds and breaking news and alerts and so much more.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.982]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[00:02:00.502 --> 00:02:04.444]  Take action!
[00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.705]  I train two, three times a day.
[00:02:07.506 --> 00:02:11.808]  They're brutal, agonizing, painful training sessions.
[00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.191]  I have to have the edge over my opponents.
[00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:24.094]  I believe that in Forest Products, Super Male Vitality, you know, that gives me the edge.
[00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:27.056]  Well, you have to know where you break.
[00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:30.740]  You know, ultimately, like, you don't push yourself to know where that breaking point is.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.422]  You're always going to be falling short of what your potential is.
[00:02:33.923 --> 00:02:39.609]  So it's really just about finding how far you can go.
[00:02:56.613 --> 00:02:57.877]  There's a lot of different things out there.
[00:02:58.981 --> 00:02:59.884]  I only use the best.
[00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:04.780]  Well, here's something we couldn't see coming from a mile away.
[00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:10.344]  Millions of smart devices have already been infected by an army of hackers.
[00:03:10.664 --> 00:03:17.069]  Of course, we've told you these so-called smart devices are completely vulnerable and susceptible to hackers.
[00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:25.475]  Well, now attackers have used an army of hijacked security cameras and video recorders to launch several massive internet attacks.
[00:03:25.515 --> 00:03:26.475]  This happened last week.
[00:03:26.876 --> 00:03:30.979]  And of course, this is prompting fresh concerns about the vulnerability
[00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:31.779]  Of course!
[00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:53.582]  So they say it's unclear whether these attackers had access to video feeds from the devices.
[00:03:54.002 --> 00:04:03.428]  I'm sure they did though, but it's not like people are going to really know what all was revealed by these hackers or what they were able to get into.
[00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:09.472]  But people only realized that they were being attacked when their websites were being taken down.
[00:04:10.072 --> 00:04:16.976]  And so the reason why experts are so concerned with this now is because hackers used to infiltrate people's personal security
[00:04:18.217 --> 00:04:18.357]  I don't
[00:04:37.183 --> 00:04:39.365]  To take out their intended targets.
[00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:54.815]  Right now what they're doing is they're doing denial of service attacks, which is one website said the traffic that was hitting their website was akin to the equivalent of 140,000 high-def movies streaming all at once.
[00:04:54.975 --> 00:04:57.897]  So you can imagine the kind of lag that that had.
[00:04:58.378 --> 00:05:04.002]  But now of course they're saying people that they're really requesting that you and I
[00:05:04.662 --> 00:05:09.746]  Take the initiative to protect our own devices and go in and really back up the firmware.
[00:05:09.806 --> 00:05:16.971]  But how are you supposed to ask someone to patch their refrigerator or their Google Nest thermostat?
[00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:25.217]  So this is a completely insane world, but we are just forging ahead full steam into this technocratic takeover.
[00:05:25.757 --> 00:05:26.458]  But that's not all.
[00:05:26.638 --> 00:05:30.000]  Hackers are also targeting our voting machines.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.983]  So these are voting systems that have been targeted in 20 different states thus far.
[00:05:35.283 --> 00:05:40.447]  So here's another conspiracy theory, until it isn't a theory, it's actually fact.
[00:05:41.067 --> 00:05:47.870]  And of course, this is FBI Director James Comey saying that bad actors are at work poking around in electoral databases.
[00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:55.413]  He's the only bad actor I'm seeing poking around here affecting this election cycle by getting his little buddy Hillary Clinton off.
[00:05:55.873 --> 00:06:00.555]  But of course, intelligence officials believe the hackers are from Russia.
[00:06:00.996 --> 00:06:02.076]  But they say, don't worry.
[00:06:02.556 --> 00:06:08.939]  Any of the voting and tabulation machines used in the general election on Election Day, they're not accessible online.
[00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:14.006]  So, we've already shown you how those are susceptible to hackers.
[00:06:14.346 --> 00:06:24.539]  The only difference this time will be that they can't blame it on the Russians, unless they send in their little Russian agents to work on the machines right there at the polling stations, as people can easily do.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.084]  But here they're worried about foreign actors influencing the election.
[00:06:29.384 --> 00:06:31.265]  What about the United Nations?
[00:06:31.486 --> 00:06:35.930]  Their unelected representatives are allowed to tell people how to vote.
[00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:42.695]  Well, the UN, their news agency, actually tweeted and then quickly deleted their tweet.
[00:06:43.076 --> 00:06:47.320]  It was a post that called for eight million Americans abroad to stop Trump.
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.921]  It was a tweet that was published
[00:06:50.242 --> 00:06:59.586]  Thursday evening, urging American expats to share a voter registration tool on the website of the activist organization, Avaz, it states, U.S.
[00:06:59.626 --> 00:07:02.867]  citizens abroad could defeat Trump if they voted.
[00:07:03.287 --> 00:07:07.469]  And the webpage is titled, The October Surprise That Will End Trump.
[00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:18.394]  So not only do we see they're going in and hacking in, blaming it on the Russians, they're signing up many people, trying to get as many new citizens signed up as they possibly can.
[00:07:19.474 --> 00:07:23.775]  Beauty Queen that everyone is continually talking about that is coming out after Trump.
[00:07:24.575 --> 00:07:27.996]  And that's not it, but they're also registering the dead.
[00:07:28.196 --> 00:07:30.337]  That's right, the dead are voting Democrats.
[00:07:30.837 --> 00:07:44.181]  An investigation launched in Harrisonburg, I believe this is in Virginia, after 20 people, 20 voter applications were turned in under the names of dead people, and they only figured this out
[00:07:44.941 --> 00:07:51.504]  Because someone there, an employee who was working in the city, recognized the name of one of these dead people.
[00:07:51.524 --> 00:07:56.626]  It was actually a distinguished resident and someone that had been working for the city for many years.
[00:07:56.666 --> 00:08:00.748]  So that's how they were able to say, whoa, wait a minute, this guy died a while ago.
[00:08:01.628 --> 00:08:11.133]  And so now Republican lawmakers are saying this is just further proof that voter fraud is real and it validates the push for stronger voter ID laws.
[00:08:11.573 --> 00:08:18.977]  But of course, the Democratic colleagues still, even in the face of this, say that it's a myth, it doesn't exist.
[00:08:19.658 --> 00:08:21.399]  But that's because the dead vote Democrat.
[00:08:22.159 --> 00:08:25.862]  And now Trump is coming out saying it's our whole system is rigged.
[00:08:25.902 --> 00:08:27.083]  We're seeing how this is rigged.
[00:08:27.403 --> 00:08:28.504]  The debate was rigged.
[00:08:29.065 --> 00:08:30.886]  We've already reported on that yesterday.
[00:08:30.946 --> 00:08:32.527]  There's some very peculiar things.
[00:08:32.547 --> 00:08:35.650]  Hillary Clinton signaling the moderator as well.
[00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:40.654]  Now he's saying, you know, I had to put up with the anchor and fight the anchor on everything I said.
[00:08:40.774 --> 00:08:41.675]  Indeed, he did.
[00:08:41.695 --> 00:08:43.656]  He says, what a rigged deal.
[00:08:43.716 --> 00:08:45.638]  I tell you, we're in such a rigged system.
[00:08:45.718 --> 00:08:46.378]  It's terrible.
[00:08:47.139 --> 00:08:47.479]  I don't know.
[00:09:05.928 --> 00:09:06.228]  I think so.
[00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:30.021]  To just shut up about women's weight.
[00:09:30.441 --> 00:09:37.726]  But it's the media who is dragging out these things from decades ago and continuing to talk about irrelevant things.
[00:09:38.147 --> 00:09:41.029]  People, we are about to go to World War III.
[00:09:41.429 --> 00:09:52.297]  Who cares if Donald Trump called a beauty pageant winner Miss Piggy because she gained 50 pounds while she was representing the beauty... It's a beauty pageant.
[00:09:52.537 --> 00:09:54.138]  They're supposed to be objectified.
[00:09:54.178 --> 00:09:55.279]  That's the whole point of it.
[00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:56.440]  And of course,
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.768]  Megyn Kelly is coming out saying, well some might find that objectification objectionable.
[00:10:01.788 --> 00:10:05.234]  Okay, but Bill Clinton the rapist is just fine.
[00:10:06.778 --> 00:10:08.799]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:10:09.239 --> 00:10:12.159]  Now I want to talk about the first presidential debate for a moment.
[00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:13.120]  Remember it?
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:13.900]  I do.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.080]  Because it was pretty bad.
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:22.782]  The fact that MSNBC's Lester Holt came out and only asked Hillary Clinton two questions and Trump 15 questions.
[00:10:23.162 --> 00:10:25.863]  The media attacked him for days after that.
[00:10:25.903 --> 00:10:31.324]  But for some reason, Teflon Don was still able to sit there and remain ahead in the polls.
[00:10:31.784 --> 00:10:35.967]  Now, immediately after the debate, Trump led in 90% of the polls.
[00:10:36.307 --> 00:10:43.692]  And still to this day, here we are, a week later, Trump is still ahead over Clinton in key battleground states as well.
[00:10:44.132 --> 00:10:47.174]  Now, some of the things that we need to look at for this next presidential debate.
[00:10:47.774 --> 00:10:51.877]  Sadly, it looks like the CIA will be running the second presidential debate.
[00:10:51.957 --> 00:10:52.277]  Why?
[00:10:52.778 --> 00:11:02.665]  Because CNN's own Anderson Cooper, who works for the Clinton News Network, will be moderating alongside Martha Raddatz of ABC.
[00:11:03.205 --> 00:11:07.348]  These two will be co-hosting and moderating this next presidential debate.
[00:11:07.568 --> 00:11:09.990]  And they're also going to be taking questions from Facebook.
[00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:16.336]  Facebook, who lots of times censors any kind of conservative trends that are happening on there as well.
[00:11:16.636 --> 00:11:28.187]  And we're supposed to be getting questions from Facebook to ask these presidential candidates that I'm pretty sure are going to be biased, leaning more towards helping Hillary and leaning more towards defeating Donald Trump.
[00:11:28.607 --> 00:11:30.688]  Now let's talk about Anderson Cooper for a second.
[00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:33.971]  Anderson Cooper interned for two summers at the CIA.
[00:11:34.431 --> 00:11:41.576]  Now we know that the CIA started a program, a secret campaign, back in the 1950s called Operation Mockingbird.
[00:11:41.876 --> 00:11:48.741]  The organization recruited leading American journalists into a propaganda network to help present the CIA's views.
[00:11:49.261 --> 00:11:52.062]  Now we know that a lot of people are scared of Donald Trump.
[00:11:52.442 --> 00:12:01.223]  A presidency that could get rid of a lot of elites, a lot of people that have a lot of money invested in Hillary Clinton, and she has a lot of money invested in them as well.
[00:12:01.623 --> 00:12:07.104]  Now a lot of people were very disappointed in how Donald Trump came out in that first debate against Hillary Clinton.
[00:12:07.124 --> 00:12:17.206]  A lot of people thought that he was too soft, that he didn't come at her hard about enough topics about Bill Clinton's affairs, about so many other topics that are out there that we could go on.
[00:12:17.266 --> 00:12:17.886]  Benghazi,
[00:12:18.206 --> 00:12:19.888]  The email scandal, you know?
[00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.792]  I think there's a strategy that Trump has fallen.
[00:12:22.833 --> 00:12:27.559]  Now, I have a lot of buddies who are Green Berets who went through the Special Forces selection.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.824]  And in that, you have to have three PT tests.
[00:12:31.889 --> 00:12:42.711]  Now if you come into that first PT test and you give it everything you have, there's a good chance that after you start going through selection, that you're running a lot, you're rug marching, your PT scores are going to decline.
[00:12:43.011 --> 00:12:46.632]  And by the time you get to that third one, you're going to start off here and end up here.
[00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:50.713]  And that's not what people want to see because they're going to remember you by the last thing you've done.
[00:12:51.133 --> 00:12:52.714]  And that's what happens in selection.
[00:12:53.094 --> 00:12:58.655]  Now we have three presidential debates that Trump has to go through to defeat Hillary Clinton.
[00:12:59.255 --> 00:13:04.676]  Now the first one he came out very moderate very presidential didn't attack too hard and that's good.
[00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:06.556]  We need him to do that on the first one.
[00:13:07.056 --> 00:13:14.398]  The second one he needs to step up his game a little bit and by the time he gets to that third presidential debate it should be the shock and awe campaign.
[00:13:14.658 --> 00:13:24.920]  He should be hitting her from every side about every single scandal that she's been involved in along with her husband as well and the money that they've given to people who have helped
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:26.181]  I think so.
[00:13:41.141 --> 00:13:47.805]  A wife can have her head chopped off by her husband without having any kind of facts or any due process for a reason why.
[00:13:47.845 --> 00:13:53.528]  He could just say that she cheated on him, boom, drag her out of the car, chop her head off, and the police will do nothing for it.
[00:13:53.828 --> 00:13:56.210]  That's the kind of woman's rights that she's fighting for.
[00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:05.735]  That's the kind of LGBTQ rights that she's fighting for when, after the Paris attack or after the Pulse nightclub attack, she brings in the father
[00:14:06.435 --> 00:14:13.700]  Of the man who killed all the people at the gay nightclub and has him sitting right behind her in the debate.
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.681]  Makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:14:16.141 --> 00:14:19.663]  But she seems to be their champion and everyone still wants to go out and vote for her.
[00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:21.544]  So this is what I want to say to Donald Trump.
[00:14:21.785 --> 00:14:23.045]  You've started off the right way.
[00:14:23.365 --> 00:14:25.427]  You need to come out a little bit harder on the second one.
[00:14:25.647 --> 00:14:28.569]  And on the third one it needs to be a shock and awe campaign.
[00:14:29.474 --> 00:14:40.343]  And hit her on every single scandal because the last debate is the only debate that people will remember in history and that's going to be the debate where you can take America back and make it great again.
[00:14:40.583 --> 00:14:42.805]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:14:43.826 --> 00:14:54.992]  FBI Director James Comey was on the hill again, digging himself a deeper hole of bottomless federal corruption as he faced an oversight hearing held by the House Judiciary Committee.
[00:14:55.132 --> 00:15:07.639]  His prepared statements served to block any chance of reopening the case surrounding Hillary's email debacle, regardless of the mounting evidence that was raised after Comey shut the case back in July of 2016.
[00:15:08.979 --> 00:15:11.961]  Last week the American people learned that Cheryl Mills,
[00:15:12.907 --> 00:15:25.478]  Secretary Clinton's longtime confidant and former State Department Chief of Staff, and Heather Samuelson, counsel to Secretary Clinton in the State Department, were granted immunity for production of their laptops.
[00:15:26.279 --> 00:15:30.002]  Why were they not targets of the FBI's criminal investigation?
[00:15:30.708 --> 00:15:34.050]  Well, a target is someone on whom you have sufficient evidence to indict.
[00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:39.513]  A subject is someone whose conduct at some point during the investigation falls within the scope of the investigation.
[00:15:39.913 --> 00:15:41.274]  So, certainly with respect to Ms.
[00:15:41.314 --> 00:15:47.217]  Mills, at least initially, because she was an email correspondent, she was a subject of the investigation.
[00:15:48.157 --> 00:15:51.599]  Did the FBI find classified information on either of their computers?
[00:15:52.359 --> 00:15:57.942]  I think there were some emails still on the computer that were recovered that were classified, is my recollection.
[00:15:58.362 --> 00:15:59.083]  Isn't that a crime?
[00:16:00.495 --> 00:16:01.155]  Is what a crime, sir?
[00:16:02.055 --> 00:16:08.557]  Having classified information on computers that are outside of the server system of the Department of State.
[00:16:09.657 --> 00:16:10.197]  Unsecured.
[00:16:11.037 --> 00:16:14.338]  No, it's certainly something, without knowing more, you couldn't conclude whether it was a crime.
[00:16:14.358 --> 00:16:26.341]  You'd have to know what were the circumstances, what was the intention around that, but it's certainly something, it's the reason we conducted a year-long investigation to understand where emails had gone on an unclassified system that contained classified information.
[00:16:26.801 --> 00:16:36.513]  Law professor John Turley recently said, of all the individuals who would warrant immunity, most would view Mills would be the very last on that list.
[00:16:36.953 --> 00:16:42.640]  If one assumes that there may have been criminal conduct, it is equivalent to immunizing H.R.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.743]  Alderman and John D. Ehrlichman
[00:16:44.983 --> 00:16:45.464]  We're good to go.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.321]  Recently, you became a director of Global Bank HSBC.
[00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:15.164]  Given that the department has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with HSBC, will you have a conflict of interest with regard to that matter?
[00:17:15.324 --> 00:17:19.386]  And if you do, or would have, how would you resolve that conflict?
[00:17:20.266 --> 00:17:25.988]  I think it would be a conflict, and so I would recuse myself from any involvement in any matter relating to my former employers.
[00:17:26.434 --> 00:17:35.763]  However, Comey earned $6 million in one year alone from Lockheed Martin, and Lockheed Martin became a Clinton Foundation donor that very year.
[00:17:35.923 --> 00:17:41.888]  Comey served as Deputy Attorney General under John Ashcroft for two years of the Bush Administration.
[00:17:42.109 --> 00:17:49.155]  When he left the Bush Administration, he went directly to Lockheed Martin and became Vice President, acting as a General Counsel.
[00:17:50.196 --> 00:17:50.917]  We're good to go.
[00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:21.179]  Former Lockheed Martin Vice President and cartel money laundering HBCU board member James Comey has ties to the Clinton crime machine that are so numerous, Comey himself should be investigated by the FBI rather than running it.
[00:18:21.359 --> 00:18:33.124]  But there he was, pretending that the extraordinary usage of immunity given to the co-conspirators of the obstruction of justice surrounding Hillary's emails was completely normal in Hillary Clinton's case.
[00:18:33.524 --> 00:18:39.228]  And hinting that a possible investigation of Hillary political enemy Roger Stone may be afoot.
[00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:53.279]  On August 8, 2016, Roger Stone, a Donald Trump confidant, revealed that he has communicated with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange about the upcoming release of additional illegally hacked Democratic documents.
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:59.824]  Mr. Stone made these statements during a Republican campaign event while answering a question about a potential October surprise.
[00:19:01.377 --> 00:19:06.801]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.

[00:19:21.872 --> 00:19:22.152]  I think so.

[00:23:05.117 --> 00:23:25.003]  Former President Bill Clinton wants to turn Motown into Mohammed Town, as he has stated publicly that the way to solve the financial crisis in Detroit, Michigan is to, wait for it, fill the city with Muslim migrants from Syria.
[00:23:25.243 --> 00:23:29.205]  The truth is the big loser in this over the long run is going to be Syria.
[00:23:29.825 --> 00:23:32.826]  This is an enormous opportunity for Americans
[00:23:34.093 --> 00:23:43.519]  Detroit has 10,000 empty, structurally sound houses.
[00:23:43.539 --> 00:23:43.519]  10,000.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.663]  And a lot of jobs to be had repairing those houses.
[00:23:49.483 --> 00:23:56.948]  But Detroit just came out of bankruptcy, and the mayor's trying to do an innovative sort of urban homesteading program there.
[00:23:58.329 --> 00:24:02.592]  But it just gives you an example of what could be done, and I think
[00:24:03.627 --> 00:24:12.684]  Any of us who've ever had a personal experience with either Syrian Americans or Syrian refugees think it's a pretty good deal.
[00:24:13.717 --> 00:24:14.938]  Yeah, he said that.
[00:24:15.638 --> 00:24:18.680]  Detroit, as you know, has completely collapsed.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.361]  Under Democrat rule, by the way.
[00:24:21.701 --> 00:24:35.889]  And now Bill Clinton wants to put the final nail in the coffin of Detroit, adding insult to injury as he says there are 10,000 homes just waiting to be occupied by Muslim migrants.
[00:24:36.449 --> 00:24:42.753]  How is it possible that this man can say things like that and liberals still love him?
[00:24:43.496 --> 00:24:45.098]  Never mind, I already know the answer to that.
[00:24:45.598 --> 00:24:48.421]  Liberalism is a mental disorder.
[00:24:48.762 --> 00:24:53.787]  And guess how many Syrian refugees Hillary Clinton wants to bring to America?
[00:24:54.187 --> 00:24:54.988]  I'll give you a hint.
[00:24:55.509 --> 00:24:59.193]  More than the entire population of Detroit.
[00:24:59.753 --> 00:25:06.457]  I think the United States has to do more and I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000.
[00:25:07.458 --> 00:25:16.223]  And don't mistake this for some kind of humanitarian effort or Hillary's compassion for others because she's not about all that.
[00:25:16.723 --> 00:25:18.024]  Just ask Haiti.
[00:25:18.504 --> 00:25:21.006]  No, this is by design.
[00:25:21.346 --> 00:25:35.934]  The tsunami of Muslim migrants pouring into Europe, and next the United States, is an orchestrated attack by globalists like billionaire George Soros, who's also bankrolling Hillary's presidential campaign.
[00:25:36.355 --> 00:25:42.478]  Meanwhile, the DHS is rubber-stamping citizenships prior to the upcoming election.
[00:25:42.798 --> 00:25:46.901]  And guess who all these lucky lotto-winning migrants will be voting for?
[00:25:47.321 --> 00:25:56.691]  Well, of course, the people who brought them here, like Hillary Clinton, who also promised them more tax money to help them through the system.
[00:25:56.911 --> 00:26:06.861]  So they get almost $2,000 each as soon as they get here in the United States, and then an additional $1,700 a month on top of that.
[00:26:07.402 --> 00:26:09.344]  Compare all that to this guy.
[00:26:09.944 --> 00:26:13.827]  An American hero who received medals in two wars.
[00:26:14.007 --> 00:26:19.170]  Well, he gets $1,200 a month, but Muslim refugees get $1,700.
[00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.392]  Does that sound fair to you?
[00:26:22.935 --> 00:26:24.775]  See, that pisses me off right there.
[00:26:25.696 --> 00:26:28.696]  Yes, we are a nation of immigrants.
[00:26:29.156 --> 00:26:35.538]  That's something that most red-blooded, patriotic, true American patriots are damn proud of.
[00:26:35.678 --> 00:26:37.898]  So it's not a race issue, alright?
[00:26:38.638 --> 00:26:40.139]  This is about open borders.
[00:26:40.219 --> 00:26:41.839]  We can't afford open borders.
[00:26:41.919 --> 00:26:46.060]  It jeopardizes our security and it cripples us financially.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.541]  We can't allow illegal, I'm gonna say it again,
[00:26:50.501 --> 00:27:00.386]  We can't allow I-L-L-E-G-A-L illegal immigrants or Muslim migrants with ties to countries with terrorism, period.
[00:27:00.506 --> 00:27:12.252]  Are the powers that be hiding behind a vetting process allowing the flow of illegal immigration in order to destroy one of the United States founding principles, that of national security?
[00:27:12.412 --> 00:27:17.415]  The increase from 2015 to the new number of 110,000
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:27.662]  The administration announced just a few weeks ago represents in and of itself a 60% increase over two years, almost a 60% increase.
[00:27:28.282 --> 00:27:36.765]  So similarly to doubling the number of slots that are available worldwide in the president's summit, it's significant and also not nearly enough.
[00:27:36.825 --> 00:27:37.745]  It's a drop in the bucket.
[00:27:38.305 --> 00:27:45.647]  But there is a vetting process being added by the chairman and others in this room, Mr. Babin and others, who have brought forth ideas to say, how do we make it stronger?
[00:27:46.209 --> 00:27:52.654]  The persons who perpetrated this crime in Paris also had visas.
[00:27:52.814 --> 00:27:53.054]  I agree.
[00:27:53.094 --> 00:27:54.836]  They could very well have been here.
[00:27:55.076 --> 00:27:56.977]  And that is the bigger concern.
[00:27:57.038 --> 00:28:02.322]  The people that blew down the Twin Towers had visas and were here.
[00:28:02.822 --> 00:28:14.464]  Did vetting stop the massacre in San Bernardino, Orlando, the recent New York and New Jersey bombing, or the recent knife attack from a radical Islamicist who attacked innocent Americans in a Minnesota mall?
[00:28:14.804 --> 00:28:22.506]  Is abandoning your country as a refugee really the answer, and would Americans do the same under similar circumstances?
[00:28:22.886 --> 00:28:28.267]  No, it would be our constitutional duty to stand and defend our Republic.
[00:28:28.707 --> 00:28:31.728]  Just how rigorous is the federal vetting program?
[00:28:32.128 --> 00:28:37.430]  Amy Pope, Deputy Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, explains, Recurrent vetting.
[00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:45.592]  Throughout this process, pending applications continue to be checked against terrorist databases to ensure new relevant terrorism information has come to light.
[00:28:45.852 --> 00:28:49.413]  If a match is found, that case is paused for further review.
[00:28:49.813 --> 00:28:53.638]  Applicants who continue to have no flags continue the process.
[00:28:53.918 --> 00:28:58.663]  If there is doubt about whether an applicant poses a security risk, they will not be admitted.
[00:28:58.844 --> 00:29:04.510]  Many refugee applicants identify themselves to the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR.
[00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:10.517]  UNHCR collects identifying documents, performs initial assessment, collects biodata,
[00:29:10.757 --> 00:29:12.678]  Name, address, birthday, place of birth.
[00:29:12.858 --> 00:29:18.180]  Collects biometrics, iris scans for Syrians and other refugee populations in the Middle East.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:22.521]  Interviews applicants to confirm refugee status and the need for resettlement.
[00:29:22.742 --> 00:29:26.663]  Applicants are received by a federally funded resettlement support center.
[00:29:26.863 --> 00:29:32.525]  They collect identifying documents, compile information to conduct biographic security checks.
[00:29:32.765 --> 00:29:37.087]  Biographic security checks start with enhanced interagency security checks.
[00:29:37.387 --> 00:29:43.211]  Refugees are subject to the highest level of security checks of any category of the traveler to the United States.
[00:29:43.592 --> 00:29:43.892]  U.S.
[00:29:43.932 --> 00:29:53.479]  security agencies screen the candidate, including National Counterterrorism Center, the Intelligence Community, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and the State Department.
[00:29:53.519 --> 00:30:04.367]  The screening looks for indicators like information that the individual is a security risk, connections to known bad actors, and outstanding warrants, immigration, or criminal violations.
[00:30:04.747 --> 00:30:15.671]  They then go through a Department of Homeland Security interview, another biometric security check, a medical check, a cultural orientation and assignment to domestic resettlement locations.
[00:30:16.071 --> 00:30:23.534]  They then travel to the United States, arrive, and are then required to apply for a green card within a year of their arrival.
[00:30:24.114 --> 00:30:26.236]  So, does that make you feel safer?
[00:30:26.557 --> 00:30:27.377]  Well, it shouldn't.
[00:30:27.798 --> 00:30:31.701]  Let me ask you, does the vetting process even matter?
[00:30:32.162 --> 00:30:48.057]  Breitbart reported leaked documents with sensitive FBI data exclusively obtained by Breitbart Texas reveal that 7,712 terrorist encounters occurred within the United States in one year, and that many of those encounters occurred near the US-Mexico border.
[00:30:48.297 --> 00:30:52.642]  The incidents are characterized as known or suspected terrorist encounters.
[00:30:52.762 --> 00:31:05.175]  Some of the encounters occurred near the U.S.-Mexico border at ports of entry and some occurred in between, indicating that persons known or reasonably suspected of being terrorists attempted to sneak into the U.S.
[00:31:05.456 --> 00:31:06.537]  across the border.
[00:31:06.777 --> 00:31:10.201]  In all, the encounters occurred in high numbers in border states.
[00:31:10.501 --> 00:31:22.004]  It is impossible to know just how many of the 500% increase of Hillary Clinton's purported refugee invasion would self-radicalize once they reach United States shores.
[00:31:22.404 --> 00:31:28.286]  We are clearly being set up for disaster and our national security is being ignored.
[00:31:28.786 --> 00:31:30.687]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:10.425]  There's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now.
[00:32:11.166 --> 00:32:16.011]  And if you're wondering how on earth we ever got in this situation, well I'll tell you how.
[00:32:16.531 --> 00:32:22.037]  When the Democrats showed their true colors, you got angry and you elected Republicans.
[00:32:22.557 --> 00:32:27.803]  And then when the Republicans showed their true colors, you got angry and elected Democrats.
[00:32:28.223 --> 00:32:38.306]  And when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither side were looking out for your best interest, you acted like they were crazy.
[00:32:38.886 --> 00:32:46.568]  But the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
[00:32:47.088 --> 00:32:52.992]  That's why it is vitally important that you wake up, America, and break the matrix.
[00:32:53.352 --> 00:32:58.316]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:58.736 --> 00:33:01.118]  Because there's a war on for your mind.

[00:33:16.737 --> 00:33:17.797]  It is simply amazing.

[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all of the essential amino acids, all of the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.783]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.004]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.346]  Yeah, this... I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:49.088]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!

[00:36:00.442 --> 00:36:01.983]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.686]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.026 --> 00:36:46.687]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:36:46.888 --> 00:36:53.009]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.

[00:37:03.757 --> 00:37:17.830]  Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
[00:37:24.736 --> 00:37:25.637]  We have no choice.
[00:37:27.098 --> 00:37:28.960]  We have no choice.
[00:37:30.663 --> 00:37:36.344]  Will the Muslim ghettos that are crippling Europe right now strike America next?
[00:37:36.624 --> 00:37:39.825]  Well, that all depends on the next election.
[00:37:39.905 --> 00:37:42.226]  InfoWars reporter John Bowne joins us now.
[00:37:42.266 --> 00:37:50.508]  We just saw your report on the tsunami of immigrants that is striking Europe, soon to be in the United States as well, if we're not careful.
[00:37:50.788 --> 00:38:00.996]  Well, they're here, you know, and one thing that our Constitution guarantees is that we ensure our domestic tranquility and we provide for the common defense.
[00:38:01.736 --> 00:38:13.886]  And everything that Obama and company have done has been an act of going against the very foundation of this country, which is to provide a common defense and provide national security.
[00:38:13.926 --> 00:38:18.309]  The national security is obviously being used on us, the Americans.
[00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:24.232]  A flow of terrorist organizations have already been here for decades.
[00:38:24.372 --> 00:38:27.394]  And I don't want to cut you off, but you've been on the border towns.
[00:38:27.454 --> 00:38:30.736]  You've done reports right there on the Texas border.
[00:38:31.756 --> 00:38:38.560]  And these guys, the Texas Border Patrol volunteers, we've seen that they are seeing alarming
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:39:01.050]  Items such as Iranian cash so it's not just all Mexican immigrants folks on where they're seeing Iranian cash Muslim prayer rugs and Arabic to English Translation books they're here the most alarming aspect of all this is that a lot of this you know we live in a an era right now where we're getting our information from a
[00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:19.238]  Hackers and Snowden level intrusions and it's the only way we can get our information and at the end of that report I read what Breitbart Texas had revealed that 7,712 terrorists were encountered.
[00:39:19.579 --> 00:39:25.902]  Terrorist encounters were held right there on the border of the United States of Mexico.
[00:39:25.982 --> 00:39:30.424]  So as these small skirmishes
[00:39:31.926 --> 00:39:38.534]  Crop up, like what happened in Orlando, and that wasn't small by any account, that was a record mass shooting by a single shooter.
[00:39:38.554 --> 00:39:42.718]  But it was a radical Muslim terrorist.
[00:39:42.839 --> 00:39:51.789]  It was a radical Muslim terrorist who, even to this day, I don't know if you knew the Gold Star mother who was asking Obama why he wants a radical Islam.
[00:39:52.169 --> 00:39:54.612]  He still won't say it because he doesn't want to offend anybody.
[00:39:55.033 --> 00:39:58.817]  Well, we're getting past the point of offending anybody.
[00:39:59.218 --> 00:40:10.671]  It's going to be really offensive when you've got a machete in your skull or your kid's arms are blown off or these things continue to aggressively, exponentially increase.
[00:40:10.731 --> 00:40:14.312]  Well, that's right, and a lot of the bleeding-hearted liberals, this is the way they get you.
[00:40:14.352 --> 00:40:19.874]  They say it's a humanitarian effort, and a lot of liberals do understand it's because of U.S.
[00:40:19.914 --> 00:40:24.716]  foreign policy that this is happening, but what they don't understand, it is by design.
[00:40:24.776 --> 00:40:26.417]  I mean, these are proxy wars.
[00:40:26.897 --> 00:40:27.258]  We're good to go.
[00:40:44.759 --> 00:40:46.981]  He's funding Black Lives Matter.
[00:40:47.041 --> 00:40:51.966]  He's also funding the whole Muslim refugee crisis in the United States.
[00:40:52.186 --> 00:40:54.729]  He's funding Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.
[00:40:55.049 --> 00:41:00.695]  And he wants to flood the entire United States with Muslim refugees.
[00:41:00.855 --> 00:41:03.297]  And that way, it's divide and conquer.
[00:41:03.357 --> 00:41:03.738]  Am I right?
[00:41:04.315 --> 00:41:07.257]  Yeah, and what is the vetting process?
[00:41:07.377 --> 00:41:09.419]  Is the vetting process actually going to help?
[00:41:09.919 --> 00:41:13.081]  Or is it just more nonsense out of Washington, D.C.?
[00:41:13.562 --> 00:41:18.465]  It doesn't matter how many people you vet, how much information you have on them.
[00:41:18.865 --> 00:41:22.428]  They will radicalize once they get here, and it's upwards of what, 23% at least?
[00:41:24.669 --> 00:41:33.612]  According to an article by... According to Barack Obama, we're all afraid of three-year-old baby orphans, but the sad truth is the majority are males.
[00:41:33.752 --> 00:41:34.952]  Well, it's not a joke anymore.
[00:41:35.272 --> 00:41:36.352]  It's not a joke anymore.
[00:41:37.353 --> 00:41:38.473]  Americans are being killed.
[00:41:38.513 --> 00:41:39.513]  You're not being killed.
[00:41:39.873 --> 00:41:46.355]  You're sitting at home watching this TV show, but somebody else in America was attacked by a guy with a machete.
[00:41:46.415 --> 00:41:49.536]  There was a guy that attacked a bunch of people in a mall in Minnesota.
[00:41:50.676 --> 00:41:52.217]  There are Americans being attacked.
[00:41:53.537 --> 00:41:57.559]  And what worries me is that we've become this domesticated nation.
[00:41:58.619 --> 00:42:02.541]  Alex has in the past always said that he fights for the free wild human.
[00:42:02.961 --> 00:42:03.741]  Think about that.
[00:42:04.361 --> 00:42:10.584]  There was a time when we were like wild beasts in the Wild West in the 19th century.
[00:42:11.044 --> 00:42:12.584]  The Constitution meant something.
[00:42:13.065 --> 00:42:19.767]  And if you did something wrong, then you had to be held accountable for it against the other wild free humans that live here.
[00:42:19.787 --> 00:42:21.668]  You said the Constitution meant more than a football game?
[00:42:22.168 --> 00:42:22.568]  It did.
[00:42:22.708 --> 00:42:22.969]  Really?
[00:42:23.089 --> 00:42:23.469]  It did.
[00:42:23.809 --> 00:42:24.089]  Yeah.
[00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:25.090]  It actually did.
[00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:26.350]  It meant a lot.
[00:42:27.591 --> 00:42:32.934]  But now we've become like these tranquil, domesticated animals.
[00:42:33.434 --> 00:42:34.815]  You know, the pets that we keep in our house.
[00:42:34.835 --> 00:42:36.436]  It's the pussification of America.
[00:42:36.536 --> 00:42:37.156]  Absolutely.
[00:42:38.837 --> 00:42:46.969]  We're going to either realize that very quickly as long as we get enough people ahead of the curve like we are here.
[00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:51.796]  And that's not because we sit around all day and think about conspiracy theories.
[00:42:51.836 --> 00:42:54.340]  It's because we know the horrible facts.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.320]  The horrible truth.
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:43:01.982]  Well, we're talking about how they get through the border illegally, but they're also fast-tracked here through the refugee crisis.
[00:43:02.122 --> 00:43:08.863]  It's like they're always trying to outdo each other, because Bill Clinton says he wants to fill the city of Detroit with Syrian refugees.
[00:43:09.164 --> 00:43:12.324]  Then Barack Obama says he wants 40,000 of them here.
[00:43:12.644 --> 00:43:14.745]  And then Hillary Clinton says, hey, I could do better than that.
[00:43:15.005 --> 00:43:17.446]  I want 65,000 to 70,000 here.
[00:43:17.766 --> 00:43:22.907]  And what they want is, what'll end up happening is you'll have these Muslim ghettos like you have
[00:43:23.647 --> 00:43:24.348]  And Belgium?
[00:43:24.708 --> 00:43:25.808]  You know, our guys went there.
[00:43:26.089 --> 00:43:27.249]  These are no-go zones.
[00:43:27.469 --> 00:43:29.170]  The police won't even go there.
[00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:30.651]  And folks, that's not racist.
[00:43:30.691 --> 00:43:31.672]  That's just the cold, hard truth.
[00:43:31.692 --> 00:43:39.837]  Well, there are already areas, Dearborn, Michigan, Amarillo, Texas, that are already on the verge of becoming Sharia law areas.
[00:43:40.937 --> 00:43:47.206]  They're also experiencing rape is going up just like it is in Sweden.
[00:43:48.107 --> 00:43:49.849]  And that's happening right here in America.
[00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:51.411]  And it has to stop.
[00:43:51.551 --> 00:43:52.993]  And we have to put a stop to it.
[00:43:53.033 --> 00:43:56.218]  The criminals are running the pageant here.
[00:43:56.638 --> 00:43:57.619]  And the problem is that
[00:43:59.212 --> 00:44:01.274]  We have to stop that narrative.
[00:44:01.414 --> 00:44:12.864]  We have to invite the true narrative in and start talking to each other honestly about what's happening and stop ignoring what's happening in places because they're a thousand miles from you but still in your same country.
[00:44:13.004 --> 00:44:23.713]  According to Pew Research, among others, there is a great hatred toward Americans by large segments of the Muslim population.
[00:44:25.126 --> 00:44:39.417]  Most recently, a poll from Center for Security Policy released data showing 25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans... These are people that are here, by the way.
[00:44:40.238 --> 00:44:42.039]  People are here.
[00:44:42.059 --> 00:44:42.239]  25, not 1%.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.461]  By the way, 1% would be unacceptable.
[00:44:44.481 --> 00:44:45.302]  1% is unacceptable.
[00:44:49.145 --> 00:44:58.092]  25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified.
[00:44:58.553 --> 00:45:02.996]  This has to be the topic that is on the forefront of everyone's mind.
[00:45:03.216 --> 00:45:04.077]  You're absolutely right.
[00:45:04.097 --> 00:45:05.938]  We're going to take a quick commercial break right now.
[00:45:05.978 --> 00:45:06.319]  But wait!
[00:45:06.499 --> 00:45:07.560]  It's not what you think.
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:11.503]  This is a TV ad that they're using to indoctrinate
[00:45:11.983 --> 00:45:13.064]  There is no way back.
[00:45:13.104 --> 00:45:16.128]  Sweden will never be the way it was.
[00:45:31.056 --> 00:45:32.157]  There's no turning back.
[00:45:32.217 --> 00:45:33.097]  That's a quote.
[00:45:33.117 --> 00:45:37.080]  Swedish TV ad says Swedes must accept multiculturalism.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.622]  It shows old Swedes and basically says you're the past.
[00:45:40.603 --> 00:45:42.664]  And then, you've got the subtitles.
[00:45:43.365 --> 00:45:46.387]  A Muslim woman looks up and says something new, the new country.
[00:45:47.805 --> 00:45:50.526]  No turning back a woman in a hijab.
[00:45:51.286 --> 00:46:06.493]  And we have George Soros' own emails running the UN, running the Obama administration, running the Hillary operation, saying we're bringing these people in to break down the culture and make the Western free culture adapt to it and submit to it.
[00:46:07.369 --> 00:46:13.751]  Because we're so inclusive, we must bring in something uninclusive to make our people submit to this.
[00:46:14.231 --> 00:46:16.772]  Then the Muslims will be the client of the government.
[00:46:17.312 --> 00:46:18.272]  Wow, so there you go.
[00:46:18.332 --> 00:46:20.713]  That's a heavy piece of propaganda there in Sweden.
[00:46:20.933 --> 00:46:22.053]  I don't think it's going to work here though.
[00:46:22.093 --> 00:46:23.794]  No, it's not going to work here.
[00:46:23.814 --> 00:46:30.855]  In fact, the Chicago Council on Global Affairs poll found that just 36% of Americans support bringing Syrian refugees in.
[00:46:31.176 --> 00:46:34.036]  And that's going to go down as Hillary pushes it up to 500%.
[00:46:34.076 --> 00:46:34.356]  Just like
[00:46:36.437 --> 00:46:42.921]  Her husband, Bill Clinton, incarcerated 500% more Americans after he became president.
[00:46:43.341 --> 00:46:45.022]  It's a globalist nightmare.
[00:46:45.062 --> 00:46:50.405]  Hillary is a globalist, and if you vote for Hillary, you're voting for a globalist stooge.
[00:46:50.505 --> 00:46:56.149]  That's right, and unlike Muslim refugees who are fleeing their countries, that's not going to happen in America.
[00:46:56.189 --> 00:46:58.070]  We're staying here, and we're going to fight.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.244 --> 00:48:52.725]  I don't know.
[00:49:08.666 --> 00:49:09.927]  Welcome back to the Nightly News.
[00:49:10.047 --> 00:49:14.690]  I'm Owen Schroer from InfoWars.com and September has been a crazy month.
[00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:21.694]  So in the final segment of the InfoWars Nightly News, we're going to talk about all the craziness that happened in the month of September.
[00:49:21.734 --> 00:49:25.556]  Let's start with a big event that was quickly distracted from by the mainstream media.
[00:49:26.522 --> 00:49:33.226]  Investigators believe he coordinated three terror attacks using homemade bombs in the New York City neighborhood of Chelsea.
[00:49:33.566 --> 00:49:35.667]  This time, 29 people are injured.
[00:49:35.907 --> 00:49:39.789]  Three hours later, word of pressure cooker is found just four blocks north.
[00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:42.091]  An undetonated pressure cooker bomb.
[00:49:42.231 --> 00:49:47.614]  Then, just after 8.30 Sunday night, two men found a backpack near the train station in Elizabeth.
[00:49:47.874 --> 00:49:49.535]  It contains five pipe bombs.
[00:49:49.895 --> 00:49:50.295]  And U.S.
[00:49:50.335 --> 00:49:57.219]  officials also tell ABC News that Rahami traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan, later telling authorities he had a wife in Pakistan.
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:02.282]  Based on the information we have now, we have every reason to believe this was an act of terror.
[00:50:02.683 --> 00:50:05.724]  Radical Islamic terror hitting us domestically.
[00:50:06.045 --> 00:50:10.247]  Of course, there was also a stabbing that was related to radical Islamic terror.
[00:50:10.267 --> 00:50:13.529]  But we were quickly distracted from this by riots in Charlotte.
[00:50:14.201 --> 00:50:18.746]  A dozen police officers hurt after riots explode in Charlotte.
[00:50:18.926 --> 00:50:25.052]  Well, rioters shutting down traffic on Interstate 85, looting cars and trucks, and setting things on fire.
[00:50:25.072 --> 00:50:28.576]  Video showing rioters jumping on top of a police cruiser.
[00:50:28.736 --> 00:50:32.320]  Other cop cars kicked and destroyed with large rocks.
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:53.057]  Now, much like the other riots we've seen, they were led by misinformation and false narratives, trying to say that Keith Scott was a peaceful man, didn't have a gun, it turned out that he did have a gun, he actually has shot a man before in Texas, and of course, what happens when we see people running with false narratives?
[00:50:53.137 --> 00:50:55.799]  We get riots on the streets and nothing accomplished.
[00:50:55.819 --> 00:50:58.682]  Of course, there was another police shooting, police
[00:50:58.942 --> 00:50:59.463]  We're good.
[00:51:11.736 --> 00:51:14.657]  In the month of September, and this was a wild one, folks.
[00:51:14.997 --> 00:51:19.399]  Did we catch Hillary Clinton and Lester Holt using hand signals?
[00:51:19.799 --> 00:51:24.020]  You can be the judge for yourself, but these videos are pretty incriminating.
[00:51:24.421 --> 00:51:28.302]  And of course, it only gets stranger from there.
[00:51:28.402 --> 00:51:35.905]  Not only does it appear that she is working with Lester Holt, it also appears she has some sort of pack and wire on her back.
[00:51:36.345 --> 00:51:39.266]  I'm not sure if this is a medical device or some sort of a
[00:51:40.546 --> 00:51:45.488]  Speaking device, but undeniably, you can see it in that image right there.
[00:51:45.548 --> 00:51:54.132]  Now, of course, we were called conspiracy theorists when we questioned Hillary Clinton's health, but how could we forget the September 11th fall at the memorial?
[00:51:54.452 --> 00:51:59.754]  Hillary Clinton, there she is, blacking out, fainting, things falling out of her pants.
[00:52:00.034 --> 00:52:02.075]  She has to be drug into this van.
[00:52:02.415 --> 00:52:04.076]  Her security quickly hides her.
[00:52:04.116 --> 00:52:05.416]  There you can see her feet dragging.
[00:52:05.456 --> 00:52:06.017]  She falls.
[00:52:06.317 --> 00:52:07.577]  She clearly fainted.
[00:52:07.617 --> 00:52:08.898]  She clearly passed out.
[00:52:09.458 --> 00:52:09.998]  Unbelievable.
[00:52:10.038 --> 00:52:12.380]  This is just a crazy month of September.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:19.064]  Now, we also saw Michael Savage get his show pulled live from the air.
[00:52:19.404 --> 00:52:22.686]  He started talking about Hillary's health and what happens?
[00:52:22.846 --> 00:52:24.187]  Magically, he's preempted.
[00:52:24.567 --> 00:52:29.190]  Magically, he is pulled from many of his national syndicates.
[00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:34.473]  This is an example of how they want to muster or put a muzzle on
[00:52:35.313 --> 00:52:36.594]  Conservative media.
[00:52:36.634 --> 00:52:40.356]  Now, of course, Gary Johnson, a presidential candidate, this guy seems to be completely clueless.
[00:52:40.376 --> 00:52:41.957]  Listen to what he said in the month of September.
[00:52:42.718 --> 00:52:45.900]  What would you do if you were elected about Aleppo?
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:47.861]  About Aleppo.
[00:52:48.801 --> 00:52:50.002]  And what is Aleppo?
[00:52:51.523 --> 00:52:51.963]  You're kidding.
[00:52:52.243 --> 00:52:52.424]  No.
[00:52:53.924 --> 00:52:54.985]  Who's your favorite foreign leader?
[00:52:55.946 --> 00:52:57.066]  Who's my favorite?
[00:52:57.086 --> 00:52:59.328]  Just name anywhere in the country, any one of the continents, any country.
[00:52:59.368 --> 00:53:01.789]  Name one foreign leader that you respect and look up to.
[00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:02.550]  Anybody.
[00:53:03.632 --> 00:53:04.873]  Mine was Shimon Peres.
[00:53:04.933 --> 00:53:06.274]  I'm talking about living.
[00:53:06.354 --> 00:53:08.034]  Go ahead.
[00:53:08.055 --> 00:53:08.755]  You gotta do this.
[00:53:08.895 --> 00:53:09.295]  Anywhere.
[00:53:09.315 --> 00:53:09.996]  Any continent.
[00:53:10.436 --> 00:53:15.158]  Canada, Mexico, Europe over there, Asia, South America, Africa.
[00:53:15.178 --> 00:53:16.939]  Name a foreign leader that you respect.
[00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:21.022]  I guess I'm having an Aleppo moment in the former president of Mexico.
[00:53:21.042 --> 00:53:22.102]  But I'm giving you the whole world.
[00:53:22.202 --> 00:53:22.843]  I know, I know.
[00:53:22.983 --> 00:53:24.164]  Anybody in the world you like.
[00:53:24.764 --> 00:53:25.144]  Anybody.
[00:53:25.504 --> 00:53:26.225]  Pick any leader.
[00:53:26.885 --> 00:53:28.686]  The former president of Mexico.
[00:53:29.507 --> 00:53:29.947]  Which one?
[00:53:31.222 --> 00:53:34.085]  I'm having a brain, I'm having a brain... Well name anybody!
[00:53:34.125 --> 00:53:34.525]  Fox!
[00:53:34.685 --> 00:53:34.966]  Fox!
[00:53:34.986 --> 00:53:36.367]  Who's your favorite farmer?
[00:53:36.427 --> 00:53:41.571]  Gary Johnson, a presidential candidate, completely clueless, completely lost in the month of September.
[00:53:41.611 --> 00:53:43.713]  Maybe he'll find himself in the month of October.
[00:53:43.973 --> 00:53:47.577]  We also had a cartoon frog declared a hate sign!
[00:53:48.257 --> 00:53:59.620]  That's right folks, you thought you heard it all from the brainwashed left, you thought you heard it all from the tolerant left, but Pepe the Frog has been declared a hate symbol.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:12.383]  You've never heard of a more childish thing in your life, a cartoon frog being considered a symbol of hate, but of course this is nothing more than an attempt to demonize Trump and call him a racist and anything affiliated with Trump a racist.
[00:54:12.763 --> 00:54:14.324]  Now we also had Colin Powell
[00:54:15.004 --> 00:54:15.625]  Email leaks!
[00:54:15.665 --> 00:54:26.932]  We've seen a lot of email leaks over the course of this election cycle, and a big one in September was Colin Powell emails, in which we saw him talking trash on Hillary Clinton, basically threatening Hillary Clinton.
[00:54:27.904 --> 00:54:44.029]  This is something that has been a negative obviously for the Democrats and even Colin Powell talking about Bill Clinton and him, well we won't use the words he used, but basically screwing around with women in the White House and how he most likely still does that to this day.
[00:54:44.349 --> 00:54:46.550]  How about Donald Trump's military endorsement?
[00:54:46.810 --> 00:54:51.772]  This was a historic moment for Donald Trump when they try to say the military isn't with him.
[00:54:52.552 --> 00:55:05.428]  Perhaps the greatest military endorsement, certainly in my lifetime, maybe of all time, where we have had, originally there were some 90 that came out, but it's over 100 military leaders have now come out for Donald Trump.
[00:55:05.568 --> 00:55:08.051]  Major developments in the Trump campaign for September.
[00:55:08.292 --> 00:55:10.714]  How about in professional sports, folks?
[00:55:11.255 --> 00:55:19.959]  Well, it started with Colin Kaepernick, and then he got praised for it, and then it went on and now more NFL players are kneeling during the National Anthem.
[00:55:20.159 --> 00:55:22.219]  Other professional athletes are considering it.
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:22.920]  Even U.S.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:26.601]  women's soccer player Megan Rapinoe decided she was going to kneel.
[00:55:27.121 --> 00:55:28.222]  Completely disgraceful for me.
[00:55:28.482 --> 00:55:31.383]  We had a train crash in New York and New Jersey.
[00:55:31.603 --> 00:55:43.008]  Now this was wild, there was a similar incident in 2011, and then there was a strange FEMA emergency broadcast the night before the crash, alluding to Green Eggs and Ham, if I could on a train, if I would on a train.
[00:55:43.288 --> 00:55:45.569]  Very curious stuff with that.
[00:55:45.729 --> 00:55:49.651]  We had an ISIS chemical attack that happened at a U.S.
[00:55:49.771 --> 00:55:51.511]  base in Iraq.
[00:55:51.531 --> 00:55:52.492]  Let's roll that video.
[00:55:53.012 --> 00:55:57.456]  But now, as we speak, this chemical shell is being tested by the U.S.
[00:55:57.496 --> 00:55:59.938]  military to see exactly what was in it.
[00:55:59.998 --> 00:56:03.781]  This shell landed on an airbase in northern Iraq, where U.S.
[00:56:03.861 --> 00:56:09.586]  and Iraqi troops are operating, getting ready to try and fight to take Mosul back from ISIS.
[00:56:10.007 --> 00:56:10.967]  The shell landed.
[00:56:11.108 --> 00:56:11.288]  U.S.
[00:56:11.328 --> 00:56:12.869]  troops went out to look at the shell.
[00:56:13.189 --> 00:56:14.651]  They saw something suspicious.
[00:56:14.731 --> 00:56:15.551]  They tested it.
[00:56:15.892 --> 00:56:19.655]  The first test came back positive for mustard agent.
[00:56:20.095 --> 00:56:23.976]  ISIS chemical attacks on a US base in Iraq.
[00:56:24.397 --> 00:56:29.638]  Now, we also had Vladimir Putin's favorite chauffeur die in a car crash.
[00:56:29.898 --> 00:56:32.159]  This was a very strange car crash.
[00:56:32.499 --> 00:56:40.042]  If you watch the video, you can see how he's driving and another man or woman driving in the middle of the road swerves right into the car.
[00:56:41.062 --> 00:56:42.904]  Truly a surreal thing, folks.
[00:56:42.924 --> 00:56:43.885]  You can see it right here.
[00:56:43.945 --> 00:56:45.707]  The car takes a turn at the last second.
[00:56:45.947 --> 00:56:46.828]  On the left, boom!
[00:56:47.148 --> 00:56:48.950]  Slams into Vladimir Putin's chauffeur.
[00:56:49.311 --> 00:56:52.494]  Was this an attempt at Vladimir Putin's life?
[00:56:52.734 --> 00:56:57.359]  Certainly another crazy development that we saw in the month of September.
[00:56:57.679 --> 00:56:59.761]  Now, we are on the eve, folks.
[00:57:00.482 --> 00:57:02.402]  of the internet handover.
[00:57:02.482 --> 00:57:10.904]  Here in September, September 30th, the internet is about to be handed over towards national conglomerates, the UN.
[00:57:11.164 --> 00:57:18.206]  This is without a doubt, this is without a doubt, a complete power withdrawal from the United States.
[00:57:18.326 --> 00:57:24.507]  Why would the United States want to hand over the internet to a national or international consortium?
[00:57:24.827 --> 00:57:28.688]  Why would the United States want to hand over the internet, something that we built
[00:57:29.188 --> 00:57:30.549]  Something that we created.
[00:57:30.949 --> 00:57:38.373]  Something that because we are the beacon of freedom and free speech in the world, we should carry the torch of internet freedom.
[00:57:38.413 --> 00:57:44.857]  But no, Barack Obama has not taken as much power away from the United States as he'd like to just yet.
[00:57:45.177 --> 00:57:47.338]  He is going to go ahead and hand over the internet.
[00:57:47.378 --> 00:57:50.720]  And of course, Ted Cruz has, to his credit,
[00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:59.422]  Has been trying to alert people in the government and citizens to do something about this internet handover but apparently it was not enough.
[00:57:59.582 --> 00:58:10.806]  Even Donald Trump has echoed what Ted Cruz has said and speaking about keeping the internet in the hands of the United States instead of in an international consortium.
[00:58:10.826 --> 00:58:11.346]  Now of course
[00:58:12.642 --> 00:58:17.625]  This is an encapsulated segment of all the craziness we saw in September.
[00:58:17.665 --> 00:58:21.927]  I didn't even mention all the clown attacks, dozens of clown attacks happening.
[00:58:21.987 --> 00:58:23.428]  So, here's my question.
[00:58:23.989 --> 00:58:32.173]  If the month of September hasn't woke you up to start caring about this country, hasn't woke you up to start doing a little research of your own, I don't know what will.
[00:58:32.513 --> 00:58:38.857]  That is an absolutely crazy month that we just witnessed in the span of nine minutes, and I'm sure we missed a lot of stuff.
[00:58:39.117 --> 00:58:40.278]  What will October bring?
[00:58:40.538 --> 00:58:42.140]  What will the October surprise be?
[00:58:42.461 --> 00:58:45.144]  I'm not sure, but stay tuned at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:45.164 --> 00:58:46.626]  We'll be sure to keep you updated.
[00:58:46.966 --> 00:58:48.548]  That's going to do it for the nightly news.
[00:58:48.909 --> 00:58:50.571]  Thanks to everybody who tuned in.
