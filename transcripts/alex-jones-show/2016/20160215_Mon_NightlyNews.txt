[00:00:19.628 --> 00:00:21.593]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:22.977]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.418 --> 00:00:25.222]  It is February 15th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:34.259]  We are interrupting regular programming to bring you breaking news.
[00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:35.440]  Reports from U.S.
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.323]  Marshals and the Governor of Texas that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has passed away.
[00:00:40.403 --> 00:00:49.828]  The mainstream news media was quick to report that the death of Justice Scalia was ruled a heart attack by natural causes in his sleep.
[00:00:50.048 --> 00:00:52.290]  So an autopsy isn't necessary.
[00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.553]  But the bizarre circumstances surrounding Scalia's death are growing more suspicious by the minute.
[00:00:59.554 --> 00:01:04.318]  This guy lied about Ben Carson when he took votes away from Ben Carson in Iowa.
[00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:05.740]  And he just continued.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.624]  Who are all those people booing Donald Trump during the debate on Saturday?
[00:01:10.644 --> 00:01:16.129]  Well it looks like tickets were given to an establishment audience full of lobbyists.
[00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.674]  And a preacher in Texas gets a citation for offending people.
[00:01:21.954 --> 00:01:25.697]  All that plus much more up next on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:01.624]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:03.206]  You can't survive without it.
[00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:04.308]  But where do you get it?
[00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:10.375]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:16.302]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:33.360]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.881]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:37.442]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:37.722 --> 00:02:38.503]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:38.743 --> 00:02:39.363]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:39.663 --> 00:02:41.484]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:03:03.936 --> 00:03:07.258]  This weekend we were greeted with the unfortunate news that a man has died.
[00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.382]  Justice Scalia was found dead this weekend in a Texas resort.
[00:03:12.022 --> 00:03:17.106]  And to tell you a little bit about the guy, later on we'll have a bunch of guys in the crew give you their takes on the situation.
[00:03:17.146 --> 00:03:22.570]  But a little bit about the man himself, he was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
[00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:34.257]  From 1986 to his death recently here in 2016 and he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan back in 1986 and as I said we'll have many of the guys on to give their takes on his recent death.
[00:03:34.718 --> 00:03:38.620]  Now he was a very strong pro-gun proponent and now we have another guy, Mr. Crapo.
[00:03:39.861 --> 00:03:47.389]  He is a senator out of Idaho and he has filed legislation to protect the Social Security beneficiaries from losing their Second Amendment rights.
[00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:57.481]  And he has filed Senate Bill 2495 to prevent the Social Security Administration from using determinations about the management and payment of an individual's benefits
[00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:59.522]  His office said in a statement.
[00:03:59.542 --> 00:04:02.845]  So basically, they're coming after your firearms any which way they can.
[00:04:02.925 --> 00:04:06.407]  If they can't do it by executive order, they're going to do it by eliminating ammunition.
[00:04:06.447 --> 00:04:13.772]  If they can't do that, it's going to be the magazines or they're going to say you're incompetent at the VA if you go to H&R Block and have somebody help you with your taxes.
[00:04:13.812 --> 00:04:16.414]  And they're coming again with the Social Security Administration.
[00:04:16.434 --> 00:04:20.357]  So good luck to you, Mr. Crapo, and hopefully you'll get your legislation passed.
[00:04:22.375 --> 00:04:28.041]  I mean, a lot of people, when I talk about foreign policy, they have this very sucks for them kind of attitude.
[00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:31.846]  You know, they'll see, you know, a church or a wedding party get blown up overseas.
[00:04:31.866 --> 00:04:32.887]  I'm like, oh, it sucks for them.
[00:04:32.947 --> 00:04:37.552]  I'm like, well, you understand those policies could come home at any point in time.
[00:04:37.572 --> 00:04:38.693]  Because yes, we do have
[00:04:39.594 --> 00:04:40.355]  We're good to go.
[00:04:59.187 --> 00:05:11.655]  And basically the Russian war plans being blamed for carrying out what has been called a deliberate attack on two makeshift hospitals and schools in northern Syria Monday that killed nearly 50 people according to the United Nations.
[00:05:12.135 --> 00:05:19.139]  Doctors Without Borders said in a statement that the hospital was hit four times and at least two attacks that were minutes apart.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.483]  Also that a third raid hit a school in a nearby village killing seven and wounding others.
[00:05:25.263 --> 00:05:33.188]  And of course, I definitely want Russia to be held responsible for these actions if it turns out that it's the case, and there's a good chance that it will be the case.
[00:05:33.768 --> 00:05:35.389]  But let us not forget that the U.S.
[00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:37.630]  has done similar things in Afghanistan.
[00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.552]  And I'm not talking about blowing up the wedding parties and all that.
[00:05:40.572 --> 00:05:41.753]  That's a whole different issue.
[00:05:42.113 --> 00:05:49.577]  If you guys recall last year, last October I believe it was, Doctors Without Borders had one of their facilities hit in Afghanistan courtesy of a U.S.
[00:05:49.677 --> 00:05:50.178]  airstrike.
[00:05:50.518 --> 00:05:51.118]  And then the U.S.
[00:05:51.158 --> 00:05:54.020]  general came out and said basically it was a human error.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:01.065]  That caused the hospital to be attacked and they said they're going to try to make up for it and do better next time.
[00:06:01.165 --> 00:06:02.166]  And that's the deal about it.
[00:06:02.186 --> 00:06:03.747]  You know, like I said, these are jets.
[00:06:04.047 --> 00:06:11.994]  We see a lot of inaccuracy with Jones, but even when you have with drones, but when you have your jet pilots who can't hit their targets, that's a very troubling thing.
[00:06:12.234 --> 00:06:13.455]  And I'm not knocking the jet pilots.
[00:06:13.495 --> 00:06:14.816]  I'm not saying that they're incompetent.
[00:06:14.856 --> 00:06:15.937]  I don't believe they're incompetent.
[00:06:15.977 --> 00:06:18.699]  I believe these guys are hitting the targets that they're told to hit.
[00:06:19.239 --> 00:06:21.142]  So it comes down to a human error.
[00:06:21.202 --> 00:06:23.324]  Yeah, but it's not the human error of the pilot.
[00:06:23.365 --> 00:06:28.571]  I think it goes back even further than that to the human error of the people giving out the orders in the first place.
[00:06:28.952 --> 00:06:29.572]  And it's not just...
[00:06:31.181 --> 00:06:32.142]  The military does this.
[00:06:32.162 --> 00:06:34.183]  You see similar things in SWAT team raids, right?
[00:06:34.503 --> 00:06:49.410]  They'll go to a raid of somebody's house that's used to live there, or they go to their mom's house, or just has horrible information, show up to some innocent lady's house, or, you know, blow up some kid's face with a flashbang grenade, and they're like, oh, well, sorry, sucks for him, he shouldn't have been there.
[00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.492]  That's basically how they treat a lot of these things, and it definitely needs to stop.
[00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:57.156]  Now, let's talk about how they're trying to stop people's First Amendment right here in the state of Texas.
[00:06:57.536 --> 00:07:03.842]  Now, I've been to the University of Texas several, several times, and I've met many interesting people.
[00:07:04.363 --> 00:07:08.687]  And I do respect people who go out and protest, even if it's something I don't agree with.
[00:07:08.827 --> 00:07:10.989]  I see abortion activists out there.
[00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:12.851]  I don't support abortion, but I do support people
[00:07:13.231 --> 00:07:19.999]  Who are willing to give up their Saturday afternoon to go out and march for whatever they think is an important cause or contact their legislators.
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.164]  But now at the University of Texas, they're citing people for offending others.
[00:07:24.464 --> 00:07:29.691]  And we see a street preacher has actually been cited for just talking to people out on the street.
[00:07:30.768 --> 00:07:42.631]  Alright, so basically what I was saying earlier, we had somebody that was offended by the gestures you were making, and that's our job is to make sure that that doesn't happen because these are students that's walking in this mall right here.
[00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:56.174]  I know you're not on campus, but you're right off campus offending students on the campus, so the job here is to write you up as a citation, disorderly conduct, for offending someone.
[00:07:57.134 --> 00:08:00.275]  Uh, does freedom of speech protect offensive speech?
[00:08:00.976 --> 00:08:01.796]  Does freedom of speech do what?
[00:08:02.136 --> 00:08:03.357]  Uh, protect offensive speech?
[00:08:04.277 --> 00:08:05.457]  It doesn't matter if it's freedom of speech.
[00:08:05.477 --> 00:08:06.278]  Someone was offended.
[00:08:06.318 --> 00:08:07.058]  That's against the law.
[00:08:07.418 --> 00:08:08.879]  I don't want to argue with you.
[00:08:09.219 --> 00:08:09.979]  It's against the law.
[00:08:10.059 --> 00:08:11.920]  I'm sorry, can you say that again?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.841]  It's against the law to offend somebody?
[00:08:14.101 --> 00:08:14.361]  Yes.
[00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:15.401]  Okay.
[00:08:15.802 --> 00:08:16.982]  So, uh, why?
[00:08:17.642 --> 00:08:21.624]  I mean, I thought freedom of speech was to protect... Look, I gotta get your ID, man.
[00:08:21.644 --> 00:08:24.785]  I mean, I don't mind you doing the camera, but you have to work with me like I work with you.
[00:08:25.145 --> 00:08:26.306]  So, could you give me your ID?
[00:08:26.886 --> 00:08:33.132]  Now, in other campus news, we see that a university is telling students to report incidents of discomfort to campus police.
[00:08:33.512 --> 00:08:36.775]  Now, I don't know what the situation is on this particular campus.
[00:08:36.815 --> 00:08:50.208]  I'm not going to judge the kids or talk bad about them, but I just know from my own personal experience being in college, the few times that I had, you know, an issue with somebody, and they were very few, most of the time it didn't even involve racism, just, you know, me and another guy just disagreed on whatever.
[00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:56.912]  I just politely told the guy that he could go fly a kite, usually up his rectum, and then go fornicate with his mother.
[00:08:57.272 --> 00:09:04.254]  Now, I was much more profane back in those days, but the point I'm making here is I didn't get the school involved and, you know, try to have, you know, big civil suits and all this other stuff.
[00:09:04.314 --> 00:09:05.575]  It wasn't an issue between me...
[00:09:06.155 --> 00:09:07.256]  The person in the school.
[00:09:07.356 --> 00:09:09.478]  It was an issue between me and that person.
[00:09:09.879 --> 00:09:20.669]  But now we see that they're asking members of the community to speak up and report alleged incidents of discrimination and incidents of discomfort regarding observed or experienced interactions of intolerance.
[00:09:20.749 --> 00:09:25.033]  And they say that there's a lot of microaggressions going on against students of color.
[00:09:25.053 --> 00:09:26.594]  You know, once again, you know, I'm not at the school.
[00:09:26.634 --> 00:09:28.036]  I'm not sure what the situation is.
[00:09:28.396 --> 00:09:29.877]  Maybe that is a big deal, but you know,
[00:09:30.478 --> 00:09:37.720]  When I had my own instances, it wasn't me versus the school, it was me versus that individual, and we were able to squash it without getting the school involved.
[00:09:38.141 --> 00:09:42.842]  Now we see schools involved in all types of things, and now they're getting into 3D printing.
[00:09:43.242 --> 00:09:46.844]  And we see Wake Forest students are printing living body parts.
[00:09:46.864 --> 00:09:53.846]  This is very interesting indeed, because my own understanding of 3D printing technology, at least from the stuff that I've researched and reported on,
[00:09:54.546 --> 00:10:00.389]  There's a lot of people making toys or they make firearms or components of firearms, any number of things.
[00:10:00.429 --> 00:10:04.231]  You can make, you know, sculptures, anything pretty much you can make on these printers now.
[00:10:04.732 --> 00:10:06.152]  But they have the body parts now.
[00:10:06.512 --> 00:10:22.561]  And they say the new approach mixes live cells with a gel that starts out as a liquid but quickly hardens to the consistency of living tissue and layers them with tiny tunnels that serve as passages for nutrients to feed cells until blood vessels can grow in and do the job naturally.
[00:10:22.981 --> 00:10:25.883]  So it's a very interesting and strange time to be alive.
[00:10:25.903 --> 00:10:32.028]  It reminds me of the sci-fi movies, all these artificial body parts.
[00:10:32.148 --> 00:10:36.031]  I guess it's becoming somewhat of a reality where you can actually grow things.
[00:10:36.071 --> 00:10:41.255]  Because you see things like troops who have arm replacements or hearing aids, pacemakers, stuff like that.
[00:10:41.295 --> 00:10:43.436]  But you can actually grow things now in Petri dishes.
[00:10:43.496 --> 00:10:46.759]  It's a very interesting time to be alive.
[00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:50.341]  And it's so interesting that the CIA wants to know everything that you do.
[00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:57.035]  If you guys haven't been paying attention, we've seen the CIA come out and say that they will spy on you throughout your dishwasher.
[00:10:57.496 --> 00:11:01.379]  They're not really supposed to be active here domestically, but they are anyway.
[00:11:01.419 --> 00:11:06.583]  They're supposed to be involved in foreign entanglements and stuff like that, but we know that they're doing things here.
[00:11:06.663 --> 00:11:11.027]  Actually, Governor Ventura has been on this show, and he talked about his experience with the CIA.
[00:11:11.067 --> 00:11:17.112]  I believe when he first became governor, he said some guys wanted to meet him in a basement or whatever it was, and he walked around.
[00:11:17.152 --> 00:11:20.755]  He's like, hey, I want to know all your names and what your position in the CIA is.
[00:11:21.095 --> 00:11:25.581]  He said some of them answered him, some of them he didn't even know if they gave their real names.
[00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:33.370]  But the point is, they're really not supposed to be active here domestically, but if you're going to be active here domestically, you should do something to keep the American people safe.
[00:11:33.691 --> 00:11:39.518]  And we've seen numerous terror attacks, and they always give the justification that there's plenty of things that go on that we have no idea about.
[00:11:39.798 --> 00:11:40.659]  And that probably is true.
[00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:49.747]  It reminds me of that scene, I believe it was in Men in Black, the first one, where Timer Lee Jones' character is talking to Will Smith.
[00:11:49.787 --> 00:12:04.702]  He said, I'm sure plenty of that stuff does happen and they do stop things that we don't even know about, but we've seen enough things that have happened in the United States of America here on domestic soil that makes you question how effective are these guys being with this mass
[00:12:05.322 --> 00:12:06.083]  Data collection.
[00:12:06.123 --> 00:12:12.249]  They can't even pinpoint the things like what happened in San Bernardino, many other things that have happened here as well.
[00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:18.997]  And now we see that the CIA director went on 60 Minutes and they say he's the man that's supposed to stop terror attacks.
[00:12:19.357 --> 00:12:25.824]  But the director of the CIA is doing a rare interview to talk about the recent terrorism here in the United States of America.
[00:12:26.892 --> 00:12:27.973]  When does terrorism end?
[00:12:28.613 --> 00:12:29.554]  I don't think terrorism ends.
[00:12:30.975 --> 00:12:32.376]  Terrorism has been with us for millennia.
[00:12:32.856 --> 00:12:43.644]  Unfortunately, the means of destruction, the ability to kill a lot of people in a very short period of time, has just increased markedly.
[00:12:44.185 --> 00:12:48.087]  And finally, tonight, this past weekend, we had the Republican debate.
[00:12:48.548 --> 00:12:52.170]  Now, I know a lot of people have pretty much given up on watching the debates.
[00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.533]  After Rand Paul left, I was pretty much done with them myself.
[00:12:56.033 --> 00:13:02.757]  Because there's basically a bunch of people on either stage, whether they're Republicans or Democrats, a bunch of people I have no interest in voting for.
[00:13:03.498 --> 00:13:08.401]  I think it's just one person talking about how they're going to wreck the country worse than the next person.
[00:13:08.481 --> 00:13:13.785]  Personally, if the election was held tomorrow, I'm probably going to vote for John McAfee of the Libertarian Party.
[00:13:13.805 --> 00:13:16.526]  I'm definitely interested in many of the positions he has to say.
[00:13:16.606 --> 00:13:19.008]  But let's talk about the Republican frontrunner.
[00:13:19.028 --> 00:13:20.769]  I guess one of the Republican frontrunners.
[00:13:20.809 --> 00:13:22.530]  They keep trying to push up Rubio.
[00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.411]  Ted Cruz is doing
[00:13:23.911 --> 00:13:30.559]  Well in various polls, but we see Trump talking about the debate, debate tickets should go to the general public, not special interests.
[00:13:30.599 --> 00:13:42.573]  Now, the Donald says many things that I don't agree with, whether it's just his personal opinions or his official policy, but I do agree with him on this matter when he's talking about how they bring these special interest groups to come in and
[00:13:43.214 --> 00:13:43.815]  We're good to go.
[00:14:01.457 --> 00:14:04.999]  He's getting away from that because just like we saw, he held his own event.
[00:14:05.019 --> 00:14:08.061]  He stepped out one of the debates, held his own event, did very well.
[00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:09.262]  He's getting publicity for that.
[00:14:09.542 --> 00:14:17.748]  And I definitely do encourage more presidential candidates not to be beholden to the mainstream narrative and just go out and do their own events like Rand Paul or Donald Trump.
[00:14:18.168 --> 00:14:19.309]  And finally, we see Trump.
[00:14:19.329 --> 00:14:23.792]  He is threatening to sue Ted Cruz over his eligibility or possibly lack thereof.
[00:14:24.492 --> 00:14:30.436]  Many people have various opinions on whether or not Ted Cruz is a viable presidential candidate because of his
[00:14:31.617 --> 00:14:35.099]  Not nationality, but his natural born citizen status.
[00:14:35.139 --> 00:14:40.042]  So only time will tell if this becomes an issue in the larger mainstream apparatus.
[00:14:40.062 --> 00:14:44.644]  But as of right now, they're pushing out Ted Cruz and guys like Marco Rubio as the golden boy.
[00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:45.625]  So stay tuned.
[00:14:45.665 --> 00:14:47.406]  After this break, we'll have many more special reports.
[00:14:47.426 --> 00:14:51.728]  We'll have Wayne Madsen, our investigative reporter, as well as other reports from the rest of the crew.
[00:14:51.768 --> 00:14:54.270]  This is the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:15:01.823 --> 00:15:03.864]  The Zika virus is still in the news.
[00:15:04.384 --> 00:15:09.366]  The Zika virus is causing states and countries in the Western Hemisphere to go on red alert.
[00:15:09.886 --> 00:15:12.267]  The Olympics in Brazil may even be threatened.
[00:15:12.567 --> 00:15:17.849]  In fact, the state of Hawaii is saying it will take a guerrilla war effort to root out the disease.
[00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.651]  But is the Zika virus the actual cause of this current health crisis?
[00:15:22.111 --> 00:15:30.775]  As Tech Times reported on February 14th, larvicide manufactured by Monsanto partner, not Zika virus, true cause of Brazil's microcephaly outbreak.
[00:15:31.115 --> 00:15:40.119]  Malformations detected in thousands of children from pregnant women living in areas where the Brazilian state added priproxafen to the drinking water is not a coincidence, the PCST wrote.
[00:15:40.499 --> 00:15:46.185]  For instance, the Brazilian Health Ministry had injected priproxifen into reservoirs in the state of Pernambuco.
[00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:50.208]  In the area, the proliferation of the mosquito carrying the Zika virus was very high.
[00:15:50.328 --> 00:15:53.331]  Pernambuco is also the first state in Brazil that noticed the problem.
[00:15:53.491 --> 00:15:57.255]  The state contains 35% of the total microcephaly cases in the country.
[00:15:57.555 --> 00:16:04.441]  A group of Argentine doctors pointed out that during past Zika epidemics, there may not have been any cases of microcephaly linked to the virus.
[00:16:04.801 --> 00:16:10.867]  In fact, about 75% of the population in countries where Zika broke out had been infected by the mosquito-borne virus.
[00:16:11.227 --> 00:16:15.651]  Zika virus has been all over the news as being cause of the birth defect known as microcephaly.
[00:16:15.851 --> 00:16:18.633]  A defect causing babies to be born with unusually small heads.
[00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:28.441]  While there is no scientific evidence that proves the link between the mosquito and the outbreak of microcephaly, health agencies such as the CDC and World Health Organization strongly allude to the fact that there is a link.
[00:16:28.701 --> 00:16:37.388]  The CDC even has a page dedicated to the Zika virus where they state, additional studies are needed to determine the degree to which Zika might be linked to microcephaly.
[00:16:37.748 --> 00:16:50.516]  And the World Health Organization states, Recently in Brazil, local health authorities have observed an increase in Guillain-Barré syndrome, which coincided with Zika virus infections in the general public, as well as an increase in babies born with microcephaly in northeast Brazil.
[00:16:50.736 --> 00:16:57.200]  Agencies investigating the Zika outbreaks are finding an increasing body of evidence about the link between the Zika virus and microcephaly.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:03.264]  However, more investigation is needed to better understand the relationship between microcephaly in babies and the Zika virus.
[00:17:03.524 --> 00:17:06.866]  In my recent article at NoMoreFakeNews, I run down the useless and deceptive
[00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:40.374]  Laboratory tests that try to define how, for example, the Zika virus is causing babies to be born with smaller heads and damaged brains.
[00:17:40.995 --> 00:17:43.456]  And the science absolutely does not hold up.
[00:17:44.016 --> 00:17:47.778]  You are talking about gigantic amounts of pesticide use down there.
[00:17:48.478 --> 00:17:51.799]  They use more pesticides in Brazil than any country in the world.
[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.920]  Any country in the world.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.982]  And many of these pesticides are banned.
[00:17:58.542 --> 00:18:03.770]  Of course, it was InfoWars that pointed out that the Rockefeller Corporation owns the Zika virus.
[00:18:14.045 --> 00:18:17.807]  So it is yet to be determined what role the Rockefellers are playing in this crisis.
[00:18:18.147 --> 00:18:29.473]  But as of now, Zika hysteria has gripped the world, and it will just be more of our freedoms that are taken away to combat this so-called disease, when it may not even be the culprit of this birth defect epidemic currently hitting Brazil.
[00:18:29.653 --> 00:18:32.655]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:18:44.079 --> 00:18:45.882]  This is a protest.
[00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:48.446]  And this is a riot.
[00:18:48.826 --> 00:18:52.632]  If you can't tell the difference, then you are part of the problem.
[00:18:53.073 --> 00:18:54.475]  InfoWars.com
[00:19:10.766 --> 00:19:12.068]  We believe in win-win, folks.
[00:19:12.128 --> 00:19:13.869]  Treating people like we want to be treated.
[00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.634]  That's why we developed IntraCeuticals with Dr. Group and other top researchers, chemists, scientists, you name it.
[00:19:18.794 --> 00:19:19.735]  He's one of our advisors.
[00:19:20.016 --> 00:19:25.481]  To come up with products like AnthroPlex that is an original product that he made just for us.
[00:19:26.422 --> 00:19:28.384]  And this is a base
[00:19:29.298 --> 00:19:34.120]  system to make super male or super female vitality work even better.
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.180]  It is natural.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.482]  It just helps get your body pumping and going in the way you need to be going.
[00:19:40.882 --> 00:19:54.566]  And Dr. Group is here until we go to break to tell us about the latest product at InfoWarsLife.com, AnthroPlex, that out of the gates, and we do this all the time with the new product, we discount it out of the gates to get you to try it, knowing that you're going to love it.
[00:19:55.566 --> 00:19:56.187]  It'll sell out.
[00:19:56.527 --> 00:20:07.295]  So, Infowarslife.com, Anthroplex, 15% off and free shipping for the next two days only when you get it with Supermail or Female Vitality.
[00:20:07.435 --> 00:20:08.215]  Let's go to Dr. Group.
[00:20:08.396 --> 00:20:14.240]  Why do you call this the foundation to start the fire and then the Supermail takes you to the next level?
[00:20:15.455 --> 00:20:32.302]  Well, we just look at the base problem that's going on right now all over the world, which is the endocrine-disrupting chemicals, the amount of estrogen that men have, the femininity of men, and what's going on even in children right now with low testosterone levels.
[00:20:32.782 --> 00:20:33.443]  We're good to go!
[00:21:00.939 --> 00:21:02.800]  What is in the goat weed?
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.300]  You've got one of the purest, strongest organic forms of it.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.921]  What's so magic about the goat weed?
[00:21:20.225 --> 00:21:33.334]  Well the horny goat weed was given that name because years ago in India they noticed that a certain time of the year this weed would grow and the goats would eat it and they would just go crazy with all the female goats.
[00:21:33.414 --> 00:21:34.935]  So that's how it was developed.
[00:21:34.955 --> 00:21:35.896]  It's called epimidium.
[00:21:36.696 --> 00:21:43.400]  And what that's been proven to do over thousands of years is increase sexual pleasure, help balance the male hormones.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.181]  It can actually be used for women as well.
[00:21:45.621 --> 00:21:52.485]  But it really kind of resets and brings the hormone balance, improves sperm motility, and increases testosterone levels.
[00:21:52.505 --> 00:21:54.506]  So it counters the stuff they've been throwing at us.
[00:21:54.766 --> 00:21:55.866]  Results will vary.
[00:21:55.946 --> 00:21:58.588]  Overall, all I know is dynamite.
[00:21:59.028 --> 00:22:03.893]  I mean, absolutely dynamite with the stamina, with the weight lifting, with the swimming.
[00:22:04.133 --> 00:22:09.137]  Folks, the new product is available, AnthroPlex, available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:09.498 --> 00:22:11.640]  Dr. Group, thank you for developing this amazing product.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.080]  Thank you.
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.742]  You know what Infowars' main job is?
[00:23:16.704 --> 00:23:17.605]  Hitting the barbed wire.
[00:23:18.586 --> 00:23:20.768]  Going up the hill first, not being afraid to be attacked.
[00:23:22.429 --> 00:23:28.574]  On 9-11, it was on the news, they were going to blow up the Solomon Brothers building, Building 7, to protect other buildings.
[00:23:29.595 --> 00:23:38.103]  They blew it up, and then people would say I was a conspiracy theorist, that they ever said blow it up, and I would go to New York,
[00:23:38.928 --> 00:23:46.373]  And I would sit there and interview people who all heard them say on the news, NPR, CBS, CNN, Fox News, the same thing.
[00:23:47.314 --> 00:23:49.455]  But Fox and all them wouldn't release the tapes.
[00:23:49.555 --> 00:23:50.056]  It was weird.
[00:23:50.416 --> 00:23:55.079]  But then years later, MSNBC, CNBC, NBC, they released all their tapes.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.722]  And then BBC did, and it was all on the tape.
[00:24:00.923 --> 00:24:03.185]  An hour before, we're going to bring it down, we're going to blow it up.
[00:24:03.265 --> 00:24:05.006]  Then they announced it had fallen early.
[00:24:06.987 --> 00:24:07.888]  And then it hadn't fallen.
[00:24:08.959 --> 00:24:11.480]  And then boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, it fell at free-fall speed.
[00:24:12.701 --> 00:24:15.142]  And then NIST came out and said, actually, it did fall at free-fall speed.
[00:24:15.302 --> 00:24:16.923]  Impossible from a fire collapse.
[00:24:18.583 --> 00:24:19.704]  Those are nearly impossible.
[00:24:20.204 --> 00:24:29.448]  And then I interviewed the deputy head of emergency management, who was basically told there's bombs, the building's gonna be brought down, and two weeks later, Barry Jennings was dead.
[00:24:30.449 --> 00:24:37.172]  And then we sent reporters to his house on Long Island, and the family wouldn't talk, and everything was being loaded in a moving truck.
[00:24:40.913 --> 00:24:42.634]  They were relocated very quickly.
[00:24:42.674 --> 00:24:44.275]  Was he even, did he really even die?
[00:24:46.957 --> 00:24:50.799]  Or they come snatch him up and say, we're putting you into a super secret program, we're gonna let you know what really happened.
[00:24:51.379 --> 00:24:53.300]  I don't know, but they said he died.
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:54.781]  Just like the DC madam.
[00:24:55.502 --> 00:25:04.607]  Just like Steak Knife, the British commando that on my show exposed that British intelligence ran the IRA, the violent element of it at the top.
[00:25:08.243 --> 00:25:11.785]  And I'm not here saying, we told you, we told you, we told you, but we're the ones that did it.
[00:25:12.626 --> 00:25:14.807]  And so on Saturday, I'm up here working.
[00:25:15.188 --> 00:25:21.752]  I called Buckley, Hammond, Anthony Gucciardi, and Rob Dewey in the morning.
[00:25:21.812 --> 00:25:24.054]  And I said, something big is about to happen.
[00:25:24.174 --> 00:25:29.737]  I want to have a big war game scenario in the conference room for at least two hours.
[00:25:29.818 --> 00:25:31.138]  I want to shoot special reports.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.142]  And I sat in that office Saturday
[00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:41.913]  Telling them something big is about to happen.
[00:25:41.953 --> 00:25:42.873]  They're all witnesses to it.
[00:25:42.894 --> 00:25:44.375]  And of course, Scalia was already dead.
[00:25:44.395 --> 00:25:45.015]  It was that morning.
[00:25:45.216 --> 00:25:46.156]  I called him about 10.
[00:25:46.417 --> 00:25:48.158]  I was like, something big.
[00:25:48.178 --> 00:25:50.080]  It's not that Scalia is that big.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:50.600]  He's huge.
[00:25:51.141 --> 00:25:58.908]  But it's that they do it and seismically what it means is that it's happening.
[00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:06.633]  Just like when you're sitting there at the park bench and you feel somebody looking at you and you turn around and the person's a hundred yards away staring right at you.
[00:26:06.873 --> 00:26:07.714]  You know, you're six cents.
[00:26:07.814 --> 00:26:10.056]  I was just like, you got to come into the office.
[00:26:10.076 --> 00:26:11.137]  Something big's about to happen.
[00:26:11.157 --> 00:26:22.166]  And we were here for seven hours preparing and planning and for scenarios of false flags and assassinations and a sense of urgency to the public.
[00:26:22.987 --> 00:26:25.129]  And then meanwhile, we're shooting Facebook mentions for
[00:26:26.397 --> 00:26:33.618]  Two hours, and people keep saying, talk about Scalia, talk about Scalia, talk about Scalia, and I'm in this desperate two-hour rant.
[00:26:33.638 --> 00:26:35.019]  It was like an hour and 50 minutes long.
[00:26:35.419 --> 00:26:37.039]  The video stopped once, it was in two parts.
[00:26:37.499 --> 00:26:40.080]  Live in the conference room, with sweat running down.
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.940]  They weren't sweating, I had sweat running down me.
[00:26:45.781 --> 00:26:47.881]  It's 65 degrees in here, folks, and I'm sweating right now.
[00:26:48.801 --> 00:26:50.242]  That happens when I'm freaked out, okay?
[00:26:51.142 --> 00:26:52.362]  My brain's going a million miles an hour.
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.521]  All I can tell you is all hell's about to break loose.
[00:27:01.181 --> 00:27:15.444]  So then I'm driving home and I'm listening to the radio and they had just announced an hour and a half before that he was found dead.
[00:27:15.504 --> 00:27:16.304]  Nothing to see here.
[00:27:16.724 --> 00:27:18.425]  Looks like natural causes, which they never say.
[00:27:18.445 --> 00:27:20.985]  And I called Buckling and I said, that's it.
[00:27:21.185 --> 00:27:22.146]  I got to come over to your place.
[00:27:22.706 --> 00:27:23.486]  I want to do another video.
[00:27:27.219 --> 00:27:37.249]  And I get up there and I say, he's a key Supreme Court Justice, there's more than 50 big cases, the Second Amendment hanging in the balance, our borders, our sovereignty, these U.N.
[00:27:37.309 --> 00:27:42.114]  treaties, he's not going along with Obamacare like the other Republicans that have reportedly been blackmailed.
[00:27:42.815 --> 00:27:47.720]  Clarence Thomas, I'd like to hear from him.
[00:27:48.936 --> 00:28:00.461]  I'll say this, Matt Drudge came here, when he's only done like one other interview in the last five years, came here a few months ago to say, I've had dinner with the top Supreme Court justices, more than a dinner, he was with them for like a day.
[00:28:01.141 --> 00:28:05.343]  He told me the hammer's coming down next year, we've been threatened to basically go along with it.
[00:28:06.843 --> 00:28:09.604]  He talked about this on air and he told me more obviously at dinner.
[00:28:11.425 --> 00:28:13.446]  But Drudge was here because he's concerned.
[00:28:17.679 --> 00:28:25.146]  See, so the Sydney Morning Herald can make jokes, and hundreds of other newspapers can make jokes, and all these publications can make jokes.
[00:28:27.568 --> 00:28:30.891]  Anthony Scalia's death sets off hysteria, conspiracy theories.
[00:28:33.473 --> 00:28:34.374]  But it doesn't matter, see.
[00:28:35.755 --> 00:28:43.482]  I'm credible with the actual people that are in the real world who have dinner with multiple Supreme Court justices, and you wouldn't believe who else was in the room.
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.282]  Talking about what you just saw happen.
[00:28:46.742 --> 00:28:51.026]  And so, obviously, Drudge began to look into him being killed immediately, because evidence was emerging.
[00:28:51.447 --> 00:28:52.928]  And Drudge is being criticized for that.
[00:28:52.948 --> 00:28:55.991]  You know, because he's the type of guy that has dinner with these people.
[00:28:57.132 --> 00:29:07.923]  See, because when you live in the real world, like I do, and the military threatens to kill you, if you keep talking about the NSA 18 years ago, oh, you learn that there is a tyranny.
[00:29:11.004 --> 00:29:15.730]  Then you learn the military has basically told the government, you have somebody else kill Jones.
[00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:16.692]  We're not going to do it.
[00:29:16.932 --> 00:29:20.276]  And by the way, information is going to leak about whoever kills him.
[00:29:20.657 --> 00:29:26.464]  You've heard Steve Pucinich on air, who's personally killed a lot of people himself, overthrown more than eight governments.
[00:29:27.065 --> 00:29:28.207]  He's on record for that.
[00:29:31.857 --> 00:29:35.400]  He knew how to use psychological warfare to make the communists do what he wanted to in Italy.
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.781]  The list goes on and on.
[00:29:37.001 --> 00:29:39.543]  That's a real guy that co-wrote books with Tom Clancy.
[00:29:39.704 --> 00:29:40.945]  That's where Clancy got his info.
[00:29:41.325 --> 00:29:52.634]  Shane, yeah, there have of course been discussions about killing you at high levels, but they know there's people that support what you're doing that are going to leak if you're killed.
[00:29:52.995 --> 00:29:56.497]  Folks, there is a full-on war for the country right now. 110%.
[00:29:59.582 --> 00:30:00.802]  This isn't a radio show.
[00:30:00.982 --> 00:30:02.003]  This isn't entertainment.
[00:30:02.163 --> 00:30:03.163]  This isn't a game.
[00:30:05.204 --> 00:30:07.144]  This is an emergency transmission.
[00:30:07.284 --> 00:30:10.145]  I'm nothing but a Paul Revere, and I'm not special.
[00:30:10.485 --> 00:30:11.826]  I learned about this early on.
[00:30:11.906 --> 00:30:13.726]  I was a paleo libertarian conservative.
[00:30:14.067 --> 00:30:22.609]  I got on air, and I would talk about things other people wouldn't talk about, so I became a conduit for sources to put out their info.
[00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:24.850]  And I was willing to die.
[00:30:25.933 --> 00:30:26.413]  To do it.
[00:30:27.033 --> 00:30:32.394]  Because my forebearers were the same, and I'm cut from the same cloth, even though I grew up in a softer age.
[00:30:35.815 --> 00:30:39.415]  I have a will to survive, a will to not be overthrown, a will to not be a slave.
[00:30:41.136 --> 00:30:42.336]  And that's what made America great.
[00:30:44.636 --> 00:30:45.517]  Was not rolling over.
[00:30:48.197 --> 00:30:53.118]  And so, the reason I talk about myself, or Matt Drudge and all of this, is because I'm in this.
[00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:56.031]  I'm in this.
[00:30:59.594 --> 00:31:00.575]  I'm living in this.
[00:31:05.579 --> 00:31:07.220]  I talk to the retired generals.
[00:31:07.721 --> 00:31:09.923]  I talk to the people in the military currently high level.
[00:31:14.487 --> 00:31:16.409]  There are former heads of special forces.
[00:31:21.633 --> 00:31:22.134]  And others.
[00:31:23.686 --> 00:31:34.274]  I've talked to three, actually, of some of the former heads of Army Special Forces, before they got promoted above that, who have security details that they have to pay for around the clock.
[00:31:34.554 --> 00:31:38.497]  And let me tell you, boys and girls, it isn't for Al-Qaeda coming after.
[00:31:45.763 --> 00:31:46.844]  You understand that, folks?
[00:31:48.407 --> 00:31:51.848]  There's already been a coup over America and now they want to mop the states up.
[00:31:53.409 --> 00:31:55.610]  They're trying to indict Governor Abbott.
[00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:57.530]  They are trying to cook.
[00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:06.073]  They have already indicted his Attorney General who is shooing Obama and brought the cases that are before Scalia on the open borders, on the gun grabbing, on the power plants.
[00:32:07.234 --> 00:32:12.376]  And they just said, you know what, we're going to indict you at dinner a year after you gave up your
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:19.901]  Your stock license, your securities license, you told people you thought a certain company ought to be a good investment.
[00:32:20.142 --> 00:32:27.243]  We're going to indict you for that while Hillary gets billions of dollars from foreign dictators in front of everybody to ship weapons to them.
[00:32:31.565 --> 00:32:33.005]  They can indict a ham sandwich.
[00:32:33.785 --> 00:32:39.527]  And you notice Abbott just came out and said, come and take our guns, you're a tyrant, we need to get the states together, there's been basically a foreign takeover.
[00:32:40.567 --> 00:32:43.848]  And we need other governors to act just the same way.
[00:33:14.893 --> 00:33:17.355]  This is Bernie Sanders and I'm quite upset.
[00:33:17.555 --> 00:33:24.298]  If you guys saw the Iowa Caucus the other night, you would know that I worked extremely hard for these votes.
[00:33:24.598 --> 00:33:30.761]  And the people that were working in the Iowa Caucus took what I worked hard for and gave it to someone else.
[00:33:31.081 --> 00:33:36.063]  A lying, cheating, horrible human being by the name of Hillary Clinton.
[00:33:38.244 --> 00:33:42.146]  I don't understand how anybody could like something like this.
[00:33:42.226 --> 00:33:54.492]  That you work hard for something your whole life and you earn something and then you're expected to give it to someone else who's not as deserving and is too lazy or more of a piece of crap than you are.
[00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:57.613]  What kind of person would even think about something like that?
[00:33:57.873 --> 00:34:01.235]  Hey, that'd be you, Bernie Sanders.
[00:34:01.475 --> 00:34:02.536]  Guess you just felt the Bern.

[00:35:18.759 --> 00:35:20.020]  The police are shoving people.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.041]  Shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:35:22.061 --> 00:35:23.801]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted.

[00:37:06.024 --> 00:37:09.186]  Joining us now in studio is our Nightly News director, Rob Dew.
[00:37:09.226 --> 00:37:12.088]  He's going to talk to us about the death of Justice Scalia.
[00:37:12.228 --> 00:37:13.809]  Now, this just happened this past weekend.
[00:37:13.849 --> 00:37:17.392]  Rob, what were your first thoughts when you heard about the death of Justice Scalia?
[00:37:17.981 --> 00:37:21.243]  Well, when I first heard about this, I thought back to early October.
[00:37:21.283 --> 00:37:26.086]  In fact, it was October 6, 2015, when Matt Drudge came to our studio.
[00:37:26.106 --> 00:37:30.449]  I actually wasn't here at the time, but I was listening intently to that interview.
[00:37:30.789 --> 00:37:39.054]  And he had these really, I guess now you could say, prophetic comments about what conversations he had with an unnamed Supreme Court Justice.
[00:37:39.074 --> 00:37:40.355]  And here's what he said.
[00:37:40.375 --> 00:37:44.157]  I had a Supreme Court Justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:46.721]  Matt, it's over for you.
[00:37:47.081 --> 00:37:49.262]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[00:37:49.542 --> 00:37:50.122]  You're out of there.
[00:37:50.742 --> 00:37:53.044]  They're going to make it so headlines you can't even use headlines.
[00:37:54.044 --> 00:38:01.668]  To have a Supreme Court Justice say that to my face, that it's over, they've got the votes, which means time is limited.
[00:38:02.875 --> 00:38:04.075]  Yeah, I remember when he said that.
[00:38:04.596 --> 00:38:05.216]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:05.296 --> 00:38:06.076]  Time is limited.
[00:38:06.416 --> 00:38:07.377]  They've got the votes.
[00:38:07.537 --> 00:38:12.279]  And now, what you look at in the Supreme Court, you have a 4-4, pretty much a tie.
[00:38:12.439 --> 00:38:17.701]  And Justice Scalia was always the tiebreaker in all these big major decisions.
[00:38:18.221 --> 00:38:22.362]  And so people are asking, well, now what's going to happen when a Supreme Court justice dies?
[00:38:22.402 --> 00:38:22.823]  What happens?
[00:38:22.843 --> 00:38:24.563]  They have cases in progress.
[00:38:24.643 --> 00:38:28.065]  They have cases that they've written about, but they haven't publicly mentioned.
[00:38:28.545 --> 00:38:30.846]  Now, here is an AP article by Mark Sherman.
[00:38:32.106 --> 00:38:38.693]  And let's see, let's go to veteran Supreme Court lawyer Roy Engelbert says that a vote of a deceased justice does not count.
[00:38:38.733 --> 00:38:48.702]  So anything he might have said that is not in the official public opinion or that they haven't officially ruled on it yet, anything he might have said or done in that does not count at all.
[00:38:49.263 --> 00:38:51.025]  And so I guess what's going to happen?
[00:38:51.045 --> 00:38:51.825]  People are going to say, well,
[00:38:52.526 --> 00:38:57.649]  You got Obama coming out saying he is going to put out a list of nominations immediately.
[00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:02.312]  But that, it's a process that they go through to put out a Supreme Court nominee.
[00:39:02.673 --> 00:39:09.717]  First, it has to go through the Judiciary Committee, where the Republicans hold an 11-9 edge in that.
[00:39:10.077 --> 00:39:14.660]  Then it has to go through the full Senate, where Republicans hold a 54-46 majority.
[00:39:14.961 --> 00:39:16.201]  And Mitch McConnell even said,
[00:39:17.242 --> 00:39:24.466]  This vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president and Ted Cruz has also vowed to filibuster any Obama nominee.
[00:39:24.946 --> 00:39:28.689]  And then you have Senator Rob Portman of Ohio who also echoed the same sentiments.
[00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:40.595]  He said it is common practice for the Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a presidential term and it's been nearly 80 years since any president was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year.
[00:39:40.935 --> 00:39:45.218]  So this would definitely be something unprecedented we would see if this were to happen.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:47.601]  Absolutely.
[00:39:47.661 --> 00:39:54.125]  Now, there are many different things we want to look into as we continue to think about the vacancies that are going to be filled.
[00:39:54.406 --> 00:39:59.850]  Actually, Paul made a very good point earlier today when he was talking about the reaction to the death of Justice Scalia.
[00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:05.314]  He was pointing out how when people questioned the death of Scalia, I have no reason to believe that it was
[00:40:05.754 --> 00:40:06.414]  We're good to go.
[00:40:23.442 --> 00:40:29.363]  Exactly, and I don't even think Obama has put out a tweet yet on the death of Justice Scalia, which is really weird.
[00:40:29.423 --> 00:40:49.987]  And also, going back to how the Senate, this election year thing, where the Senate doesn't want to make lifetime appointments, back in 1960, they passed Senate Resolution 334, and it is titled, expressing the sense of the Senate that the President should not make resets appointments to the Supreme Court except to prevent or end a breakdown in the administration of the Court's business.
[00:40:50.447 --> 00:41:03.532]  So there it is right there back in 1960 and this was passed by Democrats but then back in 2007 you even had Chuckie Schumer coming out and saying hey we got to stop these Bush appointees in a year that there's going to be an election.
[00:41:03.792 --> 00:41:10.335]  So he was making this statement back in 2007 but now the Democrats are ready to foister in anybody as quickly as possible.
[00:41:10.375 --> 00:41:11.475]  Here's what Chuckie Schumer had to say.
[00:41:11.935 --> 00:41:13.516]  We should not confirm
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:21.255]  Any Bush nominee to the Supreme Court except in extraordinary circumstances.
[00:41:23.385 --> 00:41:25.726]  Extraordinary circumstances, he says.
[00:41:26.507 --> 00:41:29.449]  And now, who's at the top of the list of nominees?
[00:41:30.089 --> 00:41:31.930]  Okay, so Fox News has a pretty good article.
[00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:36.553]  Supreme Court shortlists deep bunch of potential nominees to succeed Scalia.
[00:41:36.793 --> 00:41:38.254]  Who's at the top of the list, Jakari?
[00:41:38.694 --> 00:41:40.615]  Loretta Lynch, Attorney General.
[00:41:40.635 --> 00:41:47.179]  She's at the top of the list, and she had a bitter confirmation hearing in the Senate, and we'll get to that in a second of the things she said.
[00:41:47.419 --> 00:41:48.300]  Here's some of the other people.
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:49.821]  Judge Patricia Millett.
[00:41:50.461 --> 00:41:54.806]  She's argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court, the second most ever for a female lawyer.
[00:41:55.367 --> 00:42:03.116]  Also, Judge Sri Sreevanasan, he's a principal deputy solicitor general at the Justice Department and has argued more than two dozen cases before the Supreme Court.
[00:42:03.596 --> 00:42:08.542]  Also, Judge Paul Watford, who's a conservative libertarian federal judge and
[00:42:09.763 --> 00:42:15.289]  Well, he worked for that judge, Alex Kaczynski, and he also worked for Ruth Bader Ginsburg as a clerk.
[00:42:15.309 --> 00:42:20.433]  So this guy has, these three all have deep ties within the Supreme Court.
[00:42:20.894 --> 00:42:24.457]  And then we also have the current Attorney General, Loretta Lynch.
[00:42:24.477 --> 00:42:26.799]  I'm surprised Eric Holder is not on this list.
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:28.521]  Yeah, they could bring him back and throw him in that spot.
[00:42:28.581 --> 00:42:30.403]  I'm pretty sure he'd be quite happy about that.
[00:42:30.663 --> 00:42:34.847]  I definitely think so, and I think people have to really look at that, but I think they won't.
[00:42:35.087 --> 00:42:44.175]  The only reason they won't is to protect a confirmation hearing, which will bring up things like Fast and Furious and all the other things, including his brainwashing comments about the Second Amendment.
[00:42:44.535 --> 00:42:45.877]  But let's look at Loretta Lynch.
[00:42:46.826 --> 00:42:52.074]  Back in early January 2016, Loretta Lynch warns gun owners were watching you.
[00:42:52.574 --> 00:42:59.304]  She told a group of reporters that the federal government will be actively searching out those firearms owners who want to sidestep registration.
[00:42:59.765 --> 00:43:01.667]  And she said specifically she wants to
[00:43:02.228 --> 00:43:08.249]  Basically take Obama's executive orders and make them a permanent part of American society.
[00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:12.290]  Something that's going to fulfill their purpose long after they're gone.
[00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:18.752]  She said she would require anyone who's engaged in business of dealing firearms to register as a dealer, thus become subject to background checks.
[00:43:18.812 --> 00:43:20.492]  And that was what Breitbart reported.
[00:43:23.564 --> 00:43:26.425]  Yeah, basically, she is just hardcore on gun control.
[00:43:26.445 --> 00:43:31.206]  And then here is a video from the Daily Mail where she talks about basically thought crime.
[00:43:31.246 --> 00:43:45.591]  People who speak out against what they're seeing as this radical Muslim activity that's going on all over the world, especially with these migrants coming into Western countries and then imposing their Sharia law practices on, you know, the Westerners that live there.
[00:43:45.991 --> 00:43:49.092]  Here's what she had to say about people and their anti-Muslim rhetoric.
[00:43:49.997 --> 00:43:52.698]  Now, obviously, this is a country that is based on free speech.
[00:43:53.158 --> 00:44:04.642]  But when it edges towards violence, when we see the potential for someone lifting that mantle of anti-Muslim rhetoric, when we see that, we will take action.
[00:44:05.382 --> 00:44:12.765]  That I think we have, yes, we have charged 225 defendants with hate crimes offenses over the last six years.
[00:44:13.205 --> 00:44:15.406]  Most of those in the last three years.
[00:44:16.466 --> 00:44:19.467]  Since 9-11, we've had over a thousand investigations
[00:44:20.103 --> 00:44:23.421]  Into acts of anti-Muslim hatred, including rhetoric.
[00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:32.215]  So here we have Loretta Lynch, who's a possible Supreme Court nominee to be a justice, going after the First Amendment and Second Amendment.
[00:44:32.276 --> 00:44:36.678]  So that should definitely make people very fearful about what could happen in this election year.
[00:44:37.239 --> 00:44:37.759]  Absolutely.
[00:44:37.779 --> 00:44:39.340]  It always happens.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.482]  They go after the first or the second or the second or the first.
[00:44:41.522 --> 00:44:43.823]  Those things are usually very closely related.
[00:44:43.903 --> 00:44:49.567]  Now, Rob, you began the talk by discussing how cases will be affected by Scalia's passing.
[00:44:49.687 --> 00:44:51.849]  What exactly are the cases that he was looking into?
[00:44:52.429 --> 00:44:57.393]  Well, there was one major case that had to do with labor unions, and it looked like the unions were going to have a big defeat.
[00:44:57.993 --> 00:45:01.917]  And so it looks like without Scalia, now this kind of is up in the air.
[00:45:01.937 --> 00:45:09.783]  There was also a clash over contraception, religious liberty, and they had a big Obamacare health law case that they were looking at.
[00:45:10.143 --> 00:45:11.844]  And a lot of these things are behind closed doors.
[00:45:11.884 --> 00:45:15.665]  We don't really see them until they come out into the open when they publish their opinions.
[00:45:15.985 --> 00:45:17.545]  So it's hard to get the details on these.
[00:45:17.905 --> 00:45:20.386]  But there was definitely a lot of things that were in business.
[00:45:20.406 --> 00:45:22.847]  They had a lot of working business going on in the Supreme Court.
[00:45:23.147 --> 00:45:26.488]  So it's going to be interesting to see what happens as a result of Justice Scalia's death.
[00:45:26.848 --> 00:45:31.569]  And especially, you know, the result of not having any autopsy, not doing any investigation.
[00:45:31.989 --> 00:45:33.710]  It's just really looking fishy at this point.
[00:45:34.389 --> 00:45:40.154]  And we see that, Rob, when they go after the First Amendment, they usually go after the second, or sometimes they go after the second and then go to the first.
[00:45:40.554 --> 00:45:42.316]  Well, that's very good insight right there.
[00:45:42.436 --> 00:45:50.343]  Now, you know as well as I do, Rob, we have a crew that's on the way right now to get out there to South Texas to investigate this death of Mr. Scalia.
[00:45:50.363 --> 00:45:54.467]  They're going to talk to as many people as they can, canvass the area, and really try to find out
[00:45:54.847 --> 00:46:05.740]  But the locals think about the death, like I said, at this point I'm not convinced that any foul play was in motion here, but we could find out something completely opposite once the guys get on the ground out there.
[00:46:06.261 --> 00:46:12.968]  You know, the guy was old, obese, and smoked, but he did die with a pillow over his head, and there's no autopsy.
[00:46:13.089 --> 00:46:14.691]  That, to me, just stinks to high heaven.
[00:46:15.271 --> 00:46:17.753]  All right, we'll find out what happens as soon as the guys get out there.
[00:46:17.794 --> 00:46:18.454]  Thank you, Rob Dew.
[00:46:19.375 --> 00:46:25.621]  And coming up after this break, we have a special report from Joe Biggs and also Wayne Mattson, our investigative reporter who's headed to the border.
[00:46:30.946 --> 00:46:33.428]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:46:33.969 --> 00:46:35.490]  It just pancaked.
[00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:38.293]  Well, pancaking almost like a precision implosion.
[00:46:42.739 --> 00:46:51.109]  It's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[00:47:02.998 --> 00:47:04.019]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.559 --> 00:47:06.821]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.101 --> 00:47:14.947]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:07.512 --> 00:49:09.493]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:20.619]  Now, this past week in Savannah, Georgia, the annual conference of the American Mosquito Control Association met to discuss the upcoming problems we may face with the Zika virus.
[00:49:21.339 --> 00:49:29.103]  Now, nearly a year after the first case was discovered in Brazil, there have been tests being done.
[00:49:29.163 --> 00:49:36.287]  There have been, you know, doctors looking into us and they do believe that birth defects are caused by this and other neurological problems.
[00:49:37.614 --> 00:49:43.221]  Now what we do know is that this Zika virus is no longer something that is just abroad.
[00:49:43.541 --> 00:49:49.288]  It is now starting to bear down on our American shores and is starting to become our problem.
[00:49:50.663 --> 00:49:53.364]  Now it is already in Puerto Rico and the U.S.
[00:49:53.524 --> 00:49:54.665]  Virgin Islands.
[00:49:55.105 --> 00:50:00.347]  Now there have already been over 50 cases of Americans who have been infected abroad.
[00:50:00.947 --> 00:50:08.971]  Now what they believe, what these experts believe at this conference is that by this summer there will be a more domestic version of the Zika virus.
[00:50:09.391 --> 00:50:15.874]  Meaning the mosquitoes here will be carrying the virus and that will spread throughout the country as well.
[00:50:16.374 --> 00:50:25.603]  One of the experts there at the conference, Dennis Moore, the Director of Mosquito Control in Pasco County, Florida, said it will be like preparing for a hurricane.
[00:50:25.983 --> 00:50:32.009]  We know that it's coming from across the Gulf, but where it hits and how bad it will be is unknown.
[00:50:32.589 --> 00:50:36.994]  Now, the Aedes aegypti is the mosquito that carries this Zika virus.
[00:50:37.374 --> 00:50:41.097]  They say that this mosquito is tenacious and pretty much almost impervious.
[00:50:41.758 --> 00:50:45.820]  To the outdoor spraying techniques that we are used to here in America.
[00:50:46.341 --> 00:50:49.382]  The techniques for tracking it are outdated and underfunded.
[00:50:49.923 --> 00:51:01.850]  Now experts interviewed here this week at the conference said that the Zika virus will need or require a major shift in our country's approach to mosquito control.
[00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:05.912]  Meaning that they want to go door-to-door.
[00:51:07.554 --> 00:51:09.816]  This says it right here in the New York Times article.
[00:51:10.316 --> 00:51:19.703]  It says, a more door-to-door action, a painstaking and expensive practice that many say is a tall order or an era of shrinking budgets and weariness of government intrusion.
[00:51:21.144 --> 00:51:33.233]  And this is a quote, this guerrilla warfare house-to-house method is still very new and I'm not convinced that many places are prepared for it, said Michael Doyle, the head of the Mosquito Control of the Florida Keys.
[00:51:35.526 --> 00:51:48.077]  So they want to use, in quotation marks here, they said this, experts, the CDC's there, CDC Director Thomas Fraden, say that this is a good technique, door-to-door.
[00:51:48.537 --> 00:51:52.460]  Will this be the way they usher in mandatory vaccinations?
[00:51:53.121 --> 00:51:56.744]  And if you refuse, you and your family, what will happen?
[00:51:57.344 --> 00:52:02.849]  We already saw what happened with Chris Chrissy, the governor of New Jersey, with the Ebola crisis that happened a year ago.
[00:52:04.639 --> 00:52:07.061]  He was all about throwing people in quarantines.
[00:52:08.141 --> 00:52:10.523]  Will this happen on a large, massive scale?
[00:52:10.563 --> 00:52:17.847]  Will people give in and take this vaccination that we don't know the outcome, the effects that could happen, the side effects?
[00:52:18.528 --> 00:52:26.433]  Or will there be a huge uprising and people saying, no, you're not going to forcibly give me some kind of vaccination that I don't know the side effects on?
[00:52:26.693 --> 00:52:33.537]  And will there be a large amount of people that are forced to be held in camps and quarantined for times unknown?
[00:52:36.047 --> 00:52:38.689]  This is a problem that we will be facing in the year 2016.
[00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:43.692]  Hopefully, we can do something about this.
[00:52:44.352 --> 00:52:47.314]  Stay tuned for more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:52:47.714 --> 00:52:48.395]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[00:52:58.103 --> 00:53:06.810]  Now today we've had many of the crew come on and give their take about the death of Justice Scalia, and now we have our investigative reporter Wayne Mattson who's preparing to go on his trip down to South Texas.
[00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:08.111]  Thank you for joining us, Wayne.
[00:53:08.791 --> 00:53:09.532]  Good to be with you.
[00:53:10.172 --> 00:53:13.955]  Okay, so you've been looking into this, the death of Justice Scalia.
[00:53:14.015 --> 00:53:14.876]  What are your thoughts on this?
[00:53:16.084 --> 00:53:20.807]  Well, I've been working the phones this afternoon with people around D.C.
[00:53:20.887 --> 00:53:28.193]  and I think right at this point in time it's important not to jump to any conclusions.
[00:53:28.233 --> 00:53:38.280]  There are some troubling aspects, one of which is a report that Justice Scalia has in his will that he wanted to be cremated.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:50.682]  What I find very odd with that situation, Justice Scalia is a basic adherent of the old Latin right Catholic Church.
[00:53:50.942 --> 00:54:03.165]  He's a Roman Catholic, but I do know that he has attended the Latin Mass in Washington, and they tend to be very conservative on issues like cremation, although I believe
[00:54:04.259 --> 00:54:10.822]  The Roman Catholic Church itself officially has said cremation is okay.
[00:54:12.263 --> 00:54:27.071]  Those who tend to be more traditionalists, as was Scalia, do not view cremation the same way as more mainstream Catholics do.
[00:54:27.231 --> 00:54:31.413]  So, if he's cremated, we already have no autopsy.
[00:54:32.213 --> 00:54:39.458]  And now cremation, that means there'll never be any reasonable explanation as to what caused his death.
[00:54:40.339 --> 00:54:45.263]  Do you think that there's anything suspicious at all as to the cause of his death or the timing of it?
[00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:50.472]  Yeah, but it may not be what people are thinking.
[00:54:50.492 --> 00:55:09.584]  I understand that this weekend get-together in Texas, very similar to the Cheney situation with his lawyers, where the boys, even older men, go to basically let off steam and have a good time.
[00:55:11.065 --> 00:55:23.316]  There may be more to this than meets the eye, and it may explain why there was no autopsy, and certainly why there'd be this report of a cremation.
[00:55:24.056 --> 00:55:24.597]  Absolutely.
[00:55:24.657 --> 00:55:30.682]  Now, we know this guy was 79 years old, you know, probably not in the best of health as, you know, most 79-year-olds are.
[00:55:30.922 --> 00:55:36.147]  So, with all that playing into account, do you think that it's possible that he just died of natural causes?
[00:55:37.173 --> 00:55:44.336]  I'm not going to say that it was natural causes per se, but what it may be.
[00:55:44.356 --> 00:55:53.179]  I think instead of the idea that somebody may have murdered him, we have to look at an unintended death.
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:59.182]  People should be thinking more, maybe thinking more in terms of Warren Harding and Nelson Rockefeller in this case.
[00:56:00.157 --> 00:56:00.377]  Yes.
[00:56:00.998 --> 00:56:06.144]  Okay, so as you prepare to get on the road, you're about to get on a plane here very shortly.
[00:56:06.424 --> 00:56:12.231]  Are there any particular angles or people you're going to try to contact once you get on the ground down there in South Texas?
[00:56:12.773 --> 00:56:31.526]  Well, I think the most important thing is to find out who else was present at this get-together, which was like for the old boys getting together to have a good time, find out who all the other people present were, and just the nature of this get-together.
[00:56:32.086 --> 00:56:41.313]  It may have been more going on the evening before Judge Scalia's death than a quiet dinner and a nice, expensive bottle of wine.
[00:56:42.299 --> 00:56:42.799]  Absolutely.
[00:56:42.839 --> 00:56:44.160]  Now, Wayne, I know you stay on the move.
[00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:52.126]  You've got a lot of different stories going on, but once you're done with the Justice Scalia case, do we have any reports that we can look forward to seeing from Wayne Madsen?
[00:56:53.146 --> 00:56:55.468]  Well, there's a couple things I'm looking at.
[00:56:56.449 --> 00:57:04.194]  I think people should expect a major new expose on Marco Rubio and his alternate lifestyle in the middle of this week.
[00:57:04.929 --> 00:57:13.417]  Yeah, I remember you talking about this a little bit before and I'm sure you've got things you want to hold to later on, but what can you tell us about what you found out looking into Marco Rubio?
[00:57:14.522 --> 00:57:24.570]  Well, Marco Rubio has been very vocal against gay rights, although he seems to hedge his bets sometimes.
[00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:40.042]  Up in New Hampshire, somebody in one of his appearances, I believe it was in a diner, asked him if he thought Lindsey Graham, the senior senator from South Carolina who's supporting Jeb Bush, a woman asked Rubio
[00:57:40.642 --> 00:57:46.290]  If he thought that Lindsey Graham is gay and he said, oh no, no, he said he's not gay.
[00:57:46.690 --> 00:57:49.334]  When in fact everyone in South Carolina is gay.
[00:57:49.798 --> 00:57:51.839]  Seems to know that Lindsey Graham is gay.
[00:57:52.679 --> 00:58:04.202]  But Marco Rubio, who's campaigning in the state now, trying to recoup his losses, you know, before in New Hampshire, seemed to have a very quick answer for that.
[00:58:05.102 --> 00:58:07.843]  So maybe it's a little nervousness on his part.
[00:58:09.023 --> 00:58:13.064]  You know, today they're asking about, somebody's asking about Lindsey Graham tomorrow.
[00:58:13.084 --> 00:58:16.085]  Could they be asking him to his face about himself?
[00:58:17.654 --> 00:58:21.938]  Alright, well Wayne Mattson, we definitely look forward to seeing what you have coming up on Justice Scalia.
[00:58:22.979 --> 00:58:23.359]  You bet.
[00:58:23.959 --> 00:58:25.201]  And that's it for our show tonight.
