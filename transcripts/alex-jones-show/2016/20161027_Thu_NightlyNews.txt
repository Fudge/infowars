[00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:22.248]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.308 --> 00:00:23.990]  It's October 27th, 2016.
[00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:25.673]  I'm your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:00:25.873 --> 00:00:27.215]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:32.273 --> 00:00:37.555]  Mainstream media not only hides its bias, but gets downright criminal in its support of Hillary.
[00:00:37.776 --> 00:00:44.319]  Recently, we've seen the New York Times exposed for secretly working with Hillary to promote her, allowing her even to edit their articles about her.
[00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:52.582]  But now Montel Williams says a New York Times reporter threatened to publish his home address if he didn't work with him on a Trump hit piece.
[00:00:53.143 --> 00:00:58.025]  Then, the FBI questioned Hillary for about the same time they questioned Brad and Angelina.
[00:00:58.345 --> 00:01:04.708]  Everyone was amazed that Comey would let Hillary off even after he admitted she committed multiple felony violations.
[00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:11.390]  We look at Judge Napolitano's report, breaking down the backstory that you haven't heard about the FBI.
[00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:13.551]  And it can't be happening.
[00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:16.253]  The experts who said Brexit couldn't win.
[00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:21.135]  Yet the economy has grown two and a half times what the experts projected.
[00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:24.416]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:33.024]  Look, I'm not going to sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:01:33.284 --> 00:01:36.306]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:37.427]  Because it's already here.
[00:01:37.827 --> 00:01:38.467]  It's being announced.
[00:01:38.828 --> 00:01:42.290]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.051]  You don't let them break your will.
[00:01:44.692 --> 00:01:56.760]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app and download an app that took us over a year to develop that we're going to be expanding on the next few months with free video and audio and podcast feeds and breaking news and alerts and so much more.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.982]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[00:02:00.502 --> 00:02:04.444]  Take action!
[00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.705]  I train two, three times a day.
[00:02:07.506 --> 00:02:11.808]  They're brutal, agonizing, painful training sessions.
[00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.191]  I have to have the edge over my opponents.
[00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:24.094]  I believe that in Forest Products, Super Male Vitality, you know, that gives me the edge.
[00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:27.056]  Well, you have to know where you break.
[00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:30.740]  You know, ultimately, like, you don't push yourself to know where that breaking point is.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.422]  You're always going to be falling short of what your potential is.
[00:02:33.923 --> 00:02:39.609]  So it's really just about finding how far you can go.
[00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:57.897]  There's a lot of different things out there.
[00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:59.882]  I only use the best.
[00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:06.411]  I'm Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:10.114]  We've got a ton of news to cover tonight, so let's dig right in.
[00:03:10.154 --> 00:03:16.520]  Let's start off in Russia, where Russians are preparing for World War III, a nuclear attack.
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.183]  I'm not sure exactly what, but this is some serious training going down.
[00:03:20.203 --> 00:03:25.007]  40 million people involved, and this has been going on for days.
[00:03:25.047 --> 00:03:26.248]  They've been doing this for a while.
[00:03:26.588 --> 00:03:29.331]  There's some pretty terrifying video
[00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:29.992]  I don't know.
[00:03:44.815 --> 00:03:46.496]  For World War 3 perhaps?
[00:03:46.576 --> 00:03:48.297]  For a nuclear detonation perhaps?
[00:03:48.417 --> 00:03:50.117]  What is going on in Russia?
[00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:57.461]  Now Putin has made more statements recently saying that anybody saying that Russia is meddling in the U.S.
[00:03:57.601 --> 00:04:00.182]  election is absolutely hysterical.
[00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:02.463]  I guess he's talking about Hillary Clinton.
[00:04:02.663 --> 00:04:07.165]  President Vladimir Putin slammed as hysteria Thursday's claims that Russia has tried to interfere
[00:04:08.906 --> 00:04:16.333]  So, somebody's lying here.
[00:04:16.593 --> 00:04:17.234]  Is it Putin?
[00:04:17.614 --> 00:04:18.295]  Is it Hillary?
[00:04:18.435 --> 00:04:23.519]  Well, I know Hillary is a pathological liar, so if I had to bet, I would probably go with Hillary Clinton.
[00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:24.280]  But isn't that crazy?
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.883]  We've got two world leaders with two completely opposite opinions.
[00:04:27.923 --> 00:04:31.586]  If you take this from a non-partisan perspective, one of the two has got to be lying.
[00:04:32.327 --> 00:04:38.334]  Serious problem when we've got world leaders that are just bold-faced liars, but I think we know who Hillary Clinton really is.
[00:04:38.494 --> 00:04:44.680]  Now, speaking of Hillary Clinton, this shows you just how the FBI is colluding with her.
[00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:53.210]  This story, FBI questions Angelina Jolie for over four hours over child abuse allegations.
[00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:07.886]  So the FBI for some reason thinks it's so important they're going to investigate Brangelina for over four hours, but let's recall, when they investigated Hillary Clinton, they only questioned her for three and a half hours!
[00:05:08.587 --> 00:05:16.233]  So it's more important to look into the children of celebrities than it is to look into our national security.
[00:05:16.593 --> 00:05:20.916]  Why is the FBI even looking into Brangelina at all?
[00:05:21.116 --> 00:05:26.260]  That, I think, is where we can start and end that conversation, if you want to go there.
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:34.006]  And then, of course, they basically publicly indict Hillary Clinton with their rhetoric and then they, of course, let her walk.
[00:05:34.466 --> 00:05:40.248]  Now, if you want to know the real state of the Hillary Clinton campaign, I think I can sum it up with this story that just broke.
[00:05:40.768 --> 00:05:44.249]  Tim Kaine has had to cancel an event.
[00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.010]  A Hillary Clinton rally has been cancelled.
[00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.991]  Tim Kaine was set to speak, and they cancelled the event.
[00:05:50.031 --> 00:05:54.013]  Now, they haven't said why they've cancelled the event, but folks,
[00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:55.249]  You know.
[00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:56.430]  I know.
[00:05:57.111 --> 00:05:57.511]  They know.
[00:05:57.972 --> 00:06:00.153]  Because nobody wants to go.
[00:06:00.794 --> 00:06:03.096]  He had an event and 30 people showed up.
[00:06:03.236 --> 00:06:05.598]  It was an outright embarrassment.
[00:06:06.058 --> 00:06:09.461]  This is the true state of the Hillary Clinton campaign.
[00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:12.964]  Canceling events because nobody is going to show up.
[00:06:13.244 --> 00:06:16.127]  And if you want to know how they really operate, look at this folks.
[00:06:17.267 --> 00:06:22.491]  WikiLeaks, Clinton team leaked creep shot of Bernie Sanders in his swimming suit.
[00:06:22.531 --> 00:06:25.813]  The Clinton campaign buzzed over a picture of Bernie Sanders in his swimming suit.
[00:06:26.173 --> 00:06:28.695]  Yeah, because they've got nothing else to buzz about.
[00:06:28.975 --> 00:06:39.402]  Bill Clinton Chief of Staff Tina Flournoy emailed the attached photo of Sanders and this is the Clinton camp who openly mocks Bernie Sanders in their emails.
[00:06:39.642 --> 00:06:41.803]  They openly mock Bernie Sanders supporters.
[00:06:42.304 --> 00:06:47.067]  Sanders still campaigns for her and Sanders supporters are still going to vote for her.
[00:06:47.727 --> 00:06:48.928]  How is this possible?
[00:06:49.608 --> 00:07:00.192]  But this is, again, this just shows you how desperate the Clinton camp is when they're canceling events and putting photos of Bernie Sanders in a swimsuit out and buzzing about it as if that's some story.
[00:07:00.692 --> 00:07:06.594]  Ex-Secret Service officer behind Clinton tell-all planning to start a defamation suit.
[00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:07.635]  Now folks, this is big.
[00:07:08.135 --> 00:07:19.822]  A former Secret Service officer, Gary Byrne, we've had him on our shows before, who published an explosive tell-all from his days guarding Bill and Hillary Clinton in the White House, is about to file a defamation lawsuit against his detractors.
[00:07:20.283 --> 00:07:25.266]  In specific, Media Matters for America and David Brock.
[00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:29.467]  Please help us take down David Brock.
[00:07:29.547 --> 00:07:36.670]  Maybe we can start it with this defamation suit, and then maybe we can catch him for the money laundering that we know he is guilty of.
[00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:49.734]  The letter requests Brock and Media Matters to hold all records and communications associated with their communications regarding Byrne, including any communications between Brock and Clinton regarding Byrne, suggesting there might be collusion.
[00:07:50.194 --> 00:07:50.995]  That's right, folks.
[00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:56.721]  The Democratic crime machine is collapsing, and David Brock is part of that machine.
[00:07:57.002 --> 00:08:02.348]  If he gets exposed in this lawsuit, folks, I mean, Kramer's already out, Fovall's out.
[00:08:02.428 --> 00:08:10.497]  If we get David Brock out and Hillary Clinton out, folks, I mean, we're talking about pillars of the Democratic corruption here that are deteriorating.
[00:08:10.537 --> 00:08:11.057]  This is huge.
[00:08:11.798 --> 00:08:17.801]  Now we may have heard the story about Trump's star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame getting smashed.
[00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:21.463]  The suspect has now been arrested and charged with vandalism.
[00:08:21.843 --> 00:08:23.744]  James Otis was taken into custody.
[00:08:23.764 --> 00:08:26.945]  He's the suspect on the felony of vandalism.
[00:08:27.286 --> 00:08:27.666]  Of course,
[00:08:28.346 --> 00:08:31.008]  It's funny because I don't know how you call him a suspect.
[00:08:31.048 --> 00:08:32.109]  He was caught on camera.
[00:08:32.129 --> 00:08:33.070]  He brags about it.
[00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:37.694]  Otis said his motive for destroying the star involves sexual assault allegations against Trump.
[00:08:38.074 --> 00:08:39.315]  So a total brainwashed zombie.
[00:08:39.355 --> 00:08:39.956]  Here's what's funny.
[00:08:40.076 --> 00:08:44.500]  In the quote he says, I have four or five family members who were sexually assaulted.
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.560]  Four or five!
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.141]  He doesn't know!
[00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:47.642]  He doesn't know folks.
[00:08:47.982 --> 00:08:49.023]  This is such a big deal to him.
[00:08:49.063 --> 00:08:49.704]  This is so big.
[00:08:49.744 --> 00:08:51.285]  He has four or maybe five.
[00:08:51.806 --> 00:08:56.389]  He doesn't know but he's got family members that are guilty or I'm sorry that have been abused by sexual assault.
[00:08:57.304 --> 00:09:02.628]  And now he says that the presidential nominee from the Republicans is the poster child for sexual assault.
[00:09:02.968 --> 00:09:04.290]  No, I have some news for you.
[00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.413]  That's actually thanks to the propaganda on the television.
[00:09:08.453 --> 00:09:09.834]  That's not actually the case.
[00:09:10.254 --> 00:09:12.496]  It wasn't the case before he started running for president.
[00:09:12.536 --> 00:09:13.457]  Why is it the case now?
[00:09:13.857 --> 00:09:15.158]  Television propaganda.
[00:09:15.378 --> 00:09:16.339]  Very, very simple.
[00:09:16.659 --> 00:09:18.521]  And here's an example of how they try to do it.
[00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:19.762]  Montel Williams.
[00:09:20.262 --> 00:09:25.205]  New York Times reporter threatened to publish his address over a recent Trump story.
[00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:30.449]  He tweeted out, New York Times reporter threatened to publish my address if I didn't talk to him about this useless story.
[00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:33.330]  And the story was a New York Times hit piece.
[00:09:34.071 --> 00:09:37.613]  People saying they can't live in Trump Tower anymore, they're embarrassed about it.
[00:09:37.633 --> 00:09:39.774]  It's funny, they had no problem living there before.
[00:09:39.915 --> 00:09:41.716]  Again, this is the propaganda working.
[00:09:42.656 --> 00:09:48.720]  Times feature writer Jacob Bernstein was asking Williams, who lives in one of the Trump buildings, to cooperate with the story.
[00:09:49.061 --> 00:09:55.025]  In other words, go along with our hit piece against Donald Trump, or we're going to libel and slander you.
[00:09:55.585 --> 00:09:57.266]  Oh, it's funny how that works.
[00:09:57.306 --> 00:10:02.130]  The Democrats like intimidating people on the streets, they like intimidating people in the media.
[00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:08.391]  Now, recent polls coming out of California are saying that Trump has no chance in California.
[00:10:08.511 --> 00:10:10.732]  Numbers are dropping into uncharted territory.
[00:10:10.972 --> 00:10:12.112]  But here's the thing, it wouldn't matter.
[00:10:12.392 --> 00:10:17.473]  Trump could not get one vote in California and it wouldn't affect the results of this election.
[00:10:17.974 --> 00:10:23.655]  California is essentially a super delegate for the Democrats in the general election.
[00:10:24.395 --> 00:10:31.978]  You get 20% of what's needed out of the Electoral to College to win the election if you win California.
[00:10:32.019 --> 00:10:36.461]  This is a superdelegate for the Democratic Party, California.
[00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:37.521]  Trump has no chance.
[00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:38.161]  Of course he doesn't.
[00:10:38.201 --> 00:10:40.062]  It's the superdelegate for the Democrats.
[00:10:40.122 --> 00:10:41.323]  We've seen Hillary use it before.
[00:10:42.043 --> 00:10:47.125]  Live from Trump Tower, this is a, I believe out of Yahoo, Yahoo is bashing Donald Trump all day.
[00:10:47.245 --> 00:10:49.846]  Live from Trump Tower, the ultimate conspiracy theory.
[00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:53.988]  Now they try to make fun of Trump Tower TV, which is doing live broadcasts now.
[00:10:54.408 --> 00:10:57.169]  This is the anti-Trump propaganda.
[00:10:57.229 --> 00:10:58.990]  This is all we get from Yahoo.
[00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:02.831]  I actually had another push notification come to my cell phone right before I started this segment.
[00:11:03.252 --> 00:11:09.094]  Another woman is coming forward saying that Donald Trump grabbed her butt in a taxi 50 years ago.
[00:11:09.834 --> 00:11:12.296]  And, of course, this goes out over all the mainstream news.
[00:11:12.396 --> 00:11:13.437]  No lawsuits, though.
[00:11:13.457 --> 00:11:15.018]  They don't want to litigate for some reason.
[00:11:15.058 --> 00:11:16.499]  They just want to accuse.
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:26.166]  Now, in this story, they say how easy it is for any moron with a laptop and a dream to perfectly imitate the cheerful, vaucusness of most TV news.
[00:11:26.347 --> 00:11:27.748]  Now, actually, I would agree with this.
[00:11:28.428 --> 00:11:32.389]  I would agree with this, but they use this to try to demonize what Trump Tower TV is doing.
[00:11:32.749 --> 00:11:34.589]  No, this is the state of the mainstream news.
[00:11:35.209 --> 00:11:44.151]  The mainstream news is so pathetic that, just like you said, anybody can pick up a laptop and try to be honest on air and they will defeat the mainstream news.
[00:11:44.191 --> 00:11:47.452]  This is why InfoWars is taking off, folks, and we thank you for your support.
[00:11:47.992 --> 00:11:50.652]  Now, Trump is warning of vote flipping on machines.
[00:11:50.692 --> 00:11:52.213]  This is a story out of InfoWars.
[00:11:53.613 --> 00:11:57.496]  I listened to this all morning when I was driving into work, folks.
[00:11:57.976 --> 00:12:04.021]  Texas voting machines are switching from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton.
[00:12:04.081 --> 00:12:08.865]  We recall this happened for Ted Cruz in Texas during the primaries.
[00:12:08.965 --> 00:12:11.226]  Now it's happening in the general to Donald Trump.
[00:12:11.567 --> 00:12:17.271]  This is why Texas electioneer officials will not speak with our reporters.
[00:12:17.331 --> 00:12:18.412]  They know that they're guilty.
[00:12:18.892 --> 00:12:25.375]  Megyn Kelly is seeking a salary north of 20 million dollars with Fox News!
[00:12:25.855 --> 00:12:31.418]  She's not worth 20 cents, in my opinion, if that matters to anybody.
[00:12:31.518 --> 00:12:34.419]  I would like to see that wench off Fox News.
[00:12:34.479 --> 00:12:35.380]  I think that would be great.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:42.603]  Now, I remember mainstream news saying that the UK economy was going to collapse if they voted for Brexit, but what's this?
[00:12:43.923 --> 00:12:48.147]  UK economy grows 0.5% in three months after Brexit vote.
[00:12:48.467 --> 00:12:54.052]  The UK economy grew 0.5% in three months after the Brexit vote, the Office for National Statistics has said.
[00:12:54.553 --> 00:12:55.113]  Wow!
[00:12:55.594 --> 00:13:01.459]  Well, I'll tell ya, if that trend continues, I think they're going to be happy with that Brexit vote, don't you think?
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.823]  That Brexit vote is looking pretty good, and where's the mainstream news?
[00:13:06.624 --> 00:13:08.385]  The economy was supposed to collapse!
[00:13:09.126 --> 00:13:12.088]  Oh my gosh, it was all out chaos if the Brexit vote won.
[00:13:12.328 --> 00:13:14.750]  Oh my gosh, but here we are seeing the economy grow.
[00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.373]  Folks, this is an example of what we'll see in America if we elect Donald Trump.
[00:13:18.693 --> 00:13:19.354]  I guarantee it.
[00:13:19.974 --> 00:13:23.497]  Now Angela Merkel, I'm gonna have to agree with her for a second without vomiting here,
[00:13:23.857 --> 00:13:28.621]  Says Facebook, Google, distort perception and demands they reveal algorithms.
[00:13:28.681 --> 00:13:34.086]  She said that these algorithms, when they are not transparent, can lead to a distortion of our perception.
[00:13:34.286 --> 00:13:36.568]  They narrow our breadth of information.
[00:13:36.888 --> 00:13:38.229]  Oh my goodness!
[00:13:38.329 --> 00:13:40.491]  Am I agreeing with Angela Merkel?
[00:13:40.531 --> 00:13:43.233]  Did she just say something that is true?
[00:13:43.253 --> 00:13:44.314]  Wow!
[00:13:44.394 --> 00:13:44.774]  Shocking!
[00:13:44.794 --> 00:13:45.935]  And of course we see this
[00:13:46.756 --> 00:13:55.782]  In triplicate with Google and YouTube basically trying to rig and manipulate this election for Hillary Clinton.
[00:13:55.822 --> 00:13:57.003]  We have documented this.
[00:13:57.263 --> 00:13:58.604]  We know about the voter fraud.
[00:13:58.824 --> 00:14:00.526]  We know about the mainstream media.
[00:14:00.846 --> 00:14:03.027]  Just like Donald Trump says, she has broken the law.
[00:14:03.067 --> 00:14:05.649]  She should not even be allowed to run, folks.
[00:14:05.869 --> 00:14:11.373]  The things that she's guilty of, people in the military have suffered stricter punishments from.
[00:14:11.413 --> 00:14:14.055]  Of course, anything stricter than what she got, she got nothing.
[00:14:14.375 --> 00:14:16.136]  She didn't even get a slap on the wrist.
[00:14:16.456 --> 00:14:17.777]  She gets absolutely nothing.
[00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:21.779]  This woman got more of a punishment than Hillary Clinton did.
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.122]  And this is another protest of the National Anthem.
[00:14:26.802 --> 00:14:31.745]  76ers stop singer from performing National Anthem with a We Matter jersey on.
[00:14:32.146 --> 00:14:37.389]  Now, Seven Streeter was set to perform the National Anthem, but she never made it out onto the court.
[00:14:38.429 --> 00:14:39.410]  And I, you know,
[00:14:40.612 --> 00:14:49.155]  This is a tough one because we are all about free speech here at InfoWars, but I'd have to say that I agree with this decision because all these people are doing is they're making it about themselves.
[00:14:49.535 --> 00:14:54.216]  We had another person sing the National Anthem on a knee with a Black Lives Matter shirt on, okay?
[00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:59.178]  This is people singing the National Anthem and making it about them.
[00:14:59.878 --> 00:15:07.462]  Instead of saying, wow, what an honor it is to sing the national anthem at such a big event, they say, hmm, how can I make this about me?
[00:15:07.822 --> 00:15:10.043]  How can I draw attention to myself?
[00:15:10.583 --> 00:15:15.106]  And I salute the 76ers for pulling her from doing this because all this does
[00:15:16.437 --> 00:15:16.497]  Is
[00:15:35.851 --> 00:15:52.837]  platform you take the attention off of them and all of a sudden what do you know they quit their protest I guarantee you if she would have known that her protesting the national anthem would have resulted in her getting booted from singing it she would not have done it because she still wants to be on the main stage absolutely
[00:15:53.197 --> 00:15:57.660]  Now folks, this is a big story and this can really show you how the system works.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.303]  Systematically, time and time again, how they have these plans.
[00:16:02.603 --> 00:16:07.326]  New technology at Detroit Metro Airport allows travelers to move through security lines in a flash.
[00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:08.467]  So here's what they're going to do, folks.
[00:16:09.227 --> 00:16:14.809]  It's called Clear, certified as a qualified anti-terrorism technology by the U.S.
[00:16:14.829 --> 00:16:16.609]  Department of Homeland Security.
[00:16:17.169 --> 00:16:24.831]  They use a government identification that's validated using technology, and then we link to their biometrics.
[00:16:25.112 --> 00:16:32.114]  We take 10 fingerprints with a digital reader, we take a scan of their iris, and we take a high-res photo of their face.
[00:16:32.154 --> 00:16:32.894]  So basically,
[00:16:33.914 --> 00:16:40.857]  They can identify you with just a flash of a camera with facial recognition, iris recognition.
[00:16:41.197 --> 00:16:42.718]  They use our cell phones to do this.
[00:16:42.758 --> 00:16:44.779]  They use apps like Snapchat to do this.
[00:16:45.359 --> 00:16:52.723]  And this is the mark of the beast, folks, where you can't go anywhere without being recognized because there's scanners everywhere scanning their face.
[00:16:52.983 --> 00:16:54.804]  But see, they sell it to you as safety.
[00:16:55.524 --> 00:17:02.247]  See, what they do is first they tell you you can't get on an airplane without getting groped by the TSA as we see the logo right behind us.
[00:17:02.267 --> 00:17:03.328]  That's how they like to grope you.
[00:17:03.928 --> 00:17:05.269]  Oh, okay, so this is for our safety.
[00:17:05.289 --> 00:17:06.369]  Oh, but you know what?
[00:17:06.389 --> 00:17:08.070]  We're seeing the lines getting really long.
[00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:09.310]  This is starting to frustrate Americans.
[00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:10.031]  So what are we going to do?
[00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:19.517]  Well, let's go ahead and unveil this clear technology here, which makes us take your fingerprints, scan your face, scan your iris, and now we've got you!
[00:17:20.038 --> 00:17:21.319]  Now we've got you on everything!
[00:17:21.379 --> 00:17:26.863]  Now we can scan you, now we can identify you with the facial recognition technology that's built into everything, but hey!
[00:17:27.623 --> 00:17:32.628]  It's for your safety and it's so you can get through that pesky line at the airport quicker.
[00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:34.971]  Now, of course, this is also about business.
[00:17:35.311 --> 00:17:41.137]  This is going to cost you $179 a year if you want to enroll in this program.
[00:17:41.177 --> 00:17:42.018]  It's always about money.
[00:17:42.058 --> 00:17:43.079]  It's always about business.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.043]  But they're still going to make you go through x-rays and body scans.
[00:17:46.083 --> 00:17:46.743]  So that's nice.
[00:17:47.104 --> 00:17:50.067]  They're still going to zap you before they let you get on the plane.
[00:17:50.367 --> 00:17:52.209]  Scientists discover elixir of youth.
[00:17:52.249 --> 00:17:53.730]  Now, I always find these stories funny.
[00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:54.611]  Scientists in the U.S.
[00:17:54.651 --> 00:18:02.839]  claim to have discovered a natural compound in avocado, broccoli, and cucumber that has remarkable anti-aging effects in mice and could also work for humans.
[00:18:02.899 --> 00:18:03.199]  It's funny.
[00:18:03.459 --> 00:18:05.021]  We see all these new ad campaigns with food.
[00:18:05.361 --> 00:18:07.723]  All natural, no more preservatives, real food.
[00:18:07.923 --> 00:18:09.345]  Well, what were you serving to us before?
[00:18:09.625 --> 00:18:11.526]  Perhaps that's what's making all of us sick.
[00:18:11.846 --> 00:18:15.988]  And of course, these are the types of ingredients that go into all the products at InfoWars.com.
[00:18:16.309 --> 00:18:21.712]  Dinosaur brain tissue discovered for the first time in a 130-year-old million fossil.
[00:18:21.772 --> 00:18:24.973]  They have soft brain tissue from a dinosaur.
[00:18:24.993 --> 00:18:25.974]  This is pretty cool stuff.
[00:18:26.354 --> 00:18:27.875]  Now, I wish that we could do this.
[00:18:27.956 --> 00:18:31.279]  I wish that we could cover fossils and our history and going to the stars.
[00:18:31.579 --> 00:18:34.081]  Donald Trump says he wants to make NASA relevant again.
[00:18:34.341 --> 00:18:38.265]  But instead, I gotta come on here and I gotta talk about World War III.
[00:18:38.545 --> 00:18:41.968]  I gotta talk about rigged elections because this is what's going on in this country.
[00:18:42.048 --> 00:18:47.793]  I hope that someday we all wake up and we can grow together to figure out what's actually going on in the world.
[00:18:47.833 --> 00:18:49.235]  This is Owen Troyer for InfoWars.com.
[00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:52.478]  We'll be right back with more on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:19:01.343 --> 00:19:08.727]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:19:09.228 --> 00:19:16.872]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[00:19:17.132 --> 00:19:19.234]  As president, I will make it clear.
[00:19:20.114 --> 00:19:24.855]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:30.757]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:33.818]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[00:19:34.398 --> 00:19:37.199]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[00:19:37.239 --> 00:19:39.799]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:19:42.228 --> 00:19:44.251]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[00:19:44.591 --> 00:19:48.075]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[00:19:48.275 --> 00:19:56.145]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[00:19:58.083 --> 00:19:58.543]  The U.S.
[00:19:58.583 --> 00:20:02.186]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[00:20:02.567 --> 00:20:10.173]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[00:20:10.553 --> 00:20:12.915]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[00:20:13.275 --> 00:20:16.278]  Of course not, because she's... Look, there's a really loud noise.
[00:20:16.658 --> 00:20:21.642]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[00:20:21.662 --> 00:20:23.884]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[00:20:27.717 --> 00:20:32.128]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:21:06.607 --> 00:21:13.711]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[00:21:14.072 --> 00:21:27.280]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:39.444]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[00:21:40.105 --> 00:21:46.067]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[00:21:46.827 --> 00:21:55.211]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[00:21:55.871 --> 00:22:04.055]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[00:22:06.656 --> 00:22:08.919]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:17.031]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:22:17.813 --> 00:22:20.974]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:22:21.255 --> 00:22:24.796]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:22:24.816 --> 00:22:27.937]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:22:28.438 --> 00:22:33.220]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.621]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:22:35.961 --> 00:22:40.343]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:22:40.543 --> 00:22:42.605]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:22:43.185 --> 00:22:44.687]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:22:44.807 --> 00:22:45.047]  Exactly.
[00:22:45.067 --> 00:22:48.870]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:22:49.371 --> 00:22:57.378]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:23:02.586 --> 00:23:06.007]  We would have a country that would be in much better shape than it's, you know, highways.
[00:23:06.047 --> 00:23:07.948]  They built highways for double and triple the cost.
[00:23:07.988 --> 00:23:08.788]  They built hospitals.
[00:23:08.848 --> 00:23:14.130]  And so to people who say you're taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?
[00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:15.611]  I say the following.
[00:23:15.851 --> 00:23:19.152]  You have been covering me for the last long time.
[00:23:20.233 --> 00:23:26.395]  For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps.
[00:23:27.795 --> 00:23:29.456]  And yet you'll ask me that question.
[00:23:29.496 --> 00:23:31.557]  I think it's a very rude question to be honest with you.
[00:23:33.007 --> 00:23:34.147]  Now I know what you're thinking.
[00:23:34.327 --> 00:23:39.029]  Why would Hillary Clinton and her minions accuse anyone of taking the day off?
[00:23:39.189 --> 00:23:45.250]  All it does is draw attention to the fact that Hillary Clinton needs a lot of nap time to gear up for those 10 minute speeches.
[00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:47.171]  But this is Alinsky 101.
[00:23:47.511 --> 00:23:49.891]  It's been used by the left for decades.
[00:23:50.332 --> 00:23:51.852]  Accuse your opponents of
[00:23:51.892 --> 00:23:52.452]  Of course!
[00:24:08.701 --> 00:24:14.104]  Actually developed the organizational manual for aspiring Marxist revolutionaries here in the U.S.
[00:24:14.665 --> 00:24:17.266]  The infamous rules for radicals.
[00:24:17.787 --> 00:24:22.770]  So this is kind of the agitprop or agitator's propagandist technique.
[00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:25.451]  So this has been used by the left in inner cities.
[00:24:25.851 --> 00:24:27.552]  It's also used on college campuses.
[00:24:27.573 --> 00:24:32.175]  We know that Hillary Clinton actually did her senior thesis on Alinsky.
[00:24:32.916 --> 00:24:35.317]  Obama was really fond of his teachings.
[00:24:35.357 --> 00:24:36.818]  A lot of people said his 2008 presidential campaign
[00:24:38.639 --> 00:24:39.019]  I think so.
[00:24:57.091 --> 00:25:04.756]  Yes, there in the book it's dedicated to Lucifer, who he says is the original radical who rebelled against the establishment and gained a whole kingdom.
[00:25:05.136 --> 00:25:10.819]  So that's just to give you a little idea of who this Alinsky is and why the left idolized him, I guess.
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.520]  But if you look at rule number 11,
[00:25:13.641 --> 00:25:18.624]  If you push a negative hard and deep enough, it will break through into its counterside.
[00:25:19.105 --> 00:25:23.508]  So the winner in politics is almost always whoever is on offense.
[00:25:23.608 --> 00:25:32.234]  So if you make your opponent spend all their time refuting charges that they're extremists, racist, they hate women, they despise the poor, that means they are losing.
[00:25:32.614 --> 00:25:36.017]  And that's why Trump's always winning because he's always going on the attack.
[00:25:36.037 --> 00:25:40.840]  He doesn't fall for that PC BS and he calls them out on it just like he did Dana Bash.
[00:25:41.301 --> 00:25:47.165]  So this is what they hope to do is if they're always constantly accusing you of things, you don't have time to go after them.
[00:25:48.166 --> 00:25:57.534]  So that's why we see things like this WikiLeaks, where we're finding out now that it was actually the Clinton team who leaked the creeper shot of Bernie Sanders in his swimsuit.
[00:25:58.135 --> 00:26:03.019]  And this was something that they were going to do to try to accuse Bernie Sanders of being lazy.
[00:26:03.099 --> 00:26:11.566]  He was just lazing about in the Hamptons, taking money from Wall Street, which we know Hillary Clinton is the number one recipient of Wall Street money.
[00:26:12.387 --> 00:26:20.331]  And let's not forget that she was the one who didn't bother to visit any of the flood victims because she was fundraising in the Hamptons with Cher.
[00:26:20.791 --> 00:26:24.293]  So she's accusing Bernie Sanders of something she herself is guilty of.
[00:26:24.893 --> 00:26:27.054]  We also know that Donald Trump
[00:26:27.794 --> 00:26:28.235]  I think so.
[00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:49.092]  You know, we're going to accuse you of being a sexual assaulter, Donald Trump.
[00:26:49.152 --> 00:26:56.337]  It doesn't matter if it's true or not, because a lot of people will just think, well, if there's smoke, there's fire, and they'll believe those charges.
[00:26:56.417 --> 00:26:57.378]  This is right there.
[00:26:57.558 --> 00:26:58.579]  Rule number 11.
[00:26:58.619 --> 00:26:59.439]  This is the tactic.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:13.109]  So we know that leaked emails, Hillary Clinton's own campaign, her own staffers were struggling to deal with William J. Clinton's issues and trying to kind of prep Hillary Clinton to have to deal with a lot of this backlash.
[00:27:13.929 --> 00:27:29.095]  Um, we also know that Hillary Clinton tried to come out accusing Donald Trump of the whole birtherism, saying that Trump's birther claims are based on racism, but that's of course been debunked because she and her campaign were actually the ones who started the whole birtherism.
[00:27:29.855 --> 00:27:34.260]  They put out the picture of Obama in Somali garb.
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:39.707]  They were really working on how to expose and exploit Obama's lack of American roots.
[00:27:40.228 --> 00:27:47.737]  And they actually went out and accused Obama, you know, they blasted him for suggesting the photo of him in Somali garb was offensive.
[00:27:48.217 --> 00:27:51.298]  Why would you say this is controversial photo, Obama?
[00:27:51.618 --> 00:27:52.458]  How dare you?
[00:27:52.778 --> 00:27:54.239]  So they turned it around on him.
[00:27:54.579 --> 00:27:56.279]  So you have to understand what's happening there.
[00:27:56.319 --> 00:27:57.440]  This is Saul Alinsky 101.
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.520]  He's a favored Luciferian of the left.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.161]  And this is why Trump is going to win this.
[00:28:03.281 --> 00:28:06.322]  As you see, top forecasters say, it's not over yet.
[00:28:06.382 --> 00:28:10.123]  Don't get too comfortable, Hillary Clinton, because Donald Trump will win.
[00:28:14.855 --> 00:28:33.105]  Every expert, regardless of political party, regardless of ideology, conservative or liberal, who has ever examined these issues in a serious way, will tell you that instances of significant voter fraud are not to be found.
[00:28:33.985 --> 00:28:45.493]  The very election fraud President Obama would have us all ignore, like the sheep he perceives us all to be, has, as predicted, reared its ugly head all over the United States.
[00:28:45.793 --> 00:28:57.801]  In Texas, the issue was actually discovered on Monday morning when Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne was casting her own ballot and the voter next to her noticed that one of her votes was not filled in.
[00:28:58.021 --> 00:29:14.248]  When she reviewed her electronic ballot, Hawthorne told 12 News on Tuesday, an error in the voting machine programming by Election Systems and Software, ES&S, caused votes for one statewide Court of Appeals race not to be entered.
[00:29:14.348 --> 00:29:17.750]  When a voter tried to vote straight ticket in either party,
[00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:20.712]  According to a release from Chambers County.
[00:29:20.952 --> 00:29:27.537]  Election Systems and Software was founded in 1979 and is owned by the McCarthy Group.
[00:29:27.637 --> 00:29:38.005]  Back in 2010, the Washington Post reported ES&S was the target of a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice in 2010 due to a shady contract deal.
[00:29:38.146 --> 00:29:41.188]  And after that deal, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg
[00:29:41.368 --> 00:30:04.055]  Referred to the breakdown of the machines as a Royal Screw-Up, ES&S is based in Omaha, Nebraska, the home of operations for globalist Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Wall Street, Hillary's supporter and one of the main focuses of John DeCamp's The Franklin Cover-Up, an investigation of a corporacratic pedophile society that went all the way to the White House.
[00:30:04.475 --> 00:30:12.199]  Ironically, Buffett recently asked the question, Mr. Trump... Have you no sense of decency, sir?
[00:30:12.239 --> 00:30:21.504]  In 2014, Election Systems and Software was the largest manufacturer of voting machines in the United States, claiming customers in 4,500 localities in 42 states and two U.S.
[00:30:21.524 --> 00:30:22.044]  territories.
[00:30:25.606 --> 00:30:40.588]  And if those machines aren't bad enough, as Polizet reported, the George Soros-linked UK company Smartmatic provided voting machines for 16 states, including important battleground states like Florida and Arizona.
[00:30:40.868 --> 00:30:56.993]  Since the story first broke, the flowchart has disappeared from Smartmatic's website detailing its reach into the United States, raising further questions about the real status of the Soros-tied voting equipment and whether it is truly being deployed in U.S.
[00:30:57.053 --> 00:30:57.613]  elections.
[00:30:57.913 --> 00:31:06.816]  A petition begging Congress to have an emergency meeting session to remove the Soros-linked machines has already passed its required 100,000 signatures.
[00:31:08.456 --> 00:31:22.407]  Smartmatic has since doubled down on the debunking of Soros having any link to their organization by publishing on their website that George Soros does not have and has never had any ownership stake in Smartmatic.
[00:31:22.467 --> 00:31:25.790]  But then Smartmatic goes on to say it is no secret
[00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:37.135]  That our chairman, Lord Mark Malek Brown, is a member of a number of non-profit boards, including the Global Board of the Open Society Foundation, Soros' foundation.
[00:31:37.235 --> 00:31:48.940]  Lord Malek Brown is a highly respected global figure, whose credentials include former Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations and former Vice Chairman of the World Economic Forum.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.741]  It's real simple.
[00:31:51.081 --> 00:32:06.965]  Why in the darkest caverns of Hades is an English Lord on the board with Soros' Open Society Foundation sporting a mile-long globalist resume overseeing the United States voting process in 16 states.
[00:32:07.345 --> 00:32:09.165]  Indiana revealed it had 4,556 double registrations
[00:32:13.167 --> 00:32:17.790]  3,000 records without birth dates and 31 registered voters too young to vote.
[00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:36.742]  The FBI is currently investigating 19 dead Virginians re-registered to vote in Harrisonburg, Virginia, while a 2012 Pew study revealed that 1.8 million deceased individuals were listed as voters and that 2.75 million are registered in more than one state.
[00:32:36.922 --> 00:32:40.845]  And according to the Brennan Center for Justice, vendors are frequently
[00:32:40.925 --> 00:32:41.486]  I don't know.
[00:33:02.102 --> 00:33:06.384]  November 12th, fighting Rashad Evans in New York at Madison Square Gardens.
[00:33:06.544 --> 00:33:08.585]  I'm coming to not only win, but to dominate.
[00:33:08.685 --> 00:33:16.328]  I need to make an exclamation mark to the entire division that I have been and I still am the best fighter in that division.
[00:33:16.688 --> 00:33:18.029]  I have two months to get ready for the fight.
[00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:20.750]  I'm going to go to Albuquerque, New Mexico to Jackson Winklejohn MMA.
[00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:24.972]  We're actually going to bring some cameras from Infowars to film some of my fight camp.
[00:33:26.351 --> 00:33:32.215]  When you're training, you're training 90-minute sessions once, twice, three times a day.
[00:33:32.675 --> 00:33:34.636]  There's one day a week that I only have one workout.
[00:33:34.716 --> 00:33:36.477]  All the other days are two or three times.
[00:33:36.837 --> 00:33:40.819]  I use Superman Vitality when I'm tired, when I'm broken.
[00:33:40.899 --> 00:33:46.182]  It's those things, it's these supplements that kick me into the next gear so I can have another training session.
[00:33:46.363 --> 00:33:47.903]  It's cold-pressed, known herbs.
[00:33:47.963 --> 00:33:48.664]  I didn't develop this.
[00:33:48.704 --> 00:33:51.405]  The top herbologist, doctor group in the country.
[00:33:51.505 --> 00:33:52.166]  It's the best.
[00:33:52.526 --> 00:33:55.848]  It's like sold in medical clinics, but it doesn't copy testosterone.
[00:33:56.088 --> 00:33:59.371]  It only gets your body to release the hormones you already have.
[00:33:59.731 --> 00:34:05.635]  And what I'm told is it actually blocks estrogen mimickers that are in all the plastics and crap, so it brings you more to your natural state.
[00:34:05.755 --> 00:34:08.697]  What's in the things that I'm taking are real herbs.
[00:34:08.737 --> 00:34:12.119]  This is real food that I'm taking before workouts and after workouts.
[00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:12.760]  Totally natural.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.542]  Totally natural to feel better and to be the most elite athlete on the planet.
[00:34:16.582 --> 00:34:20.005]  And by the way, years ago, you and Shane were going out and getting raw milk.
[00:34:20.125 --> 00:34:21.786]  You were getting your vegetables from the Amish.
[00:34:21.926 --> 00:34:22.566]  Go buy the product.
[00:34:22.667 --> 00:34:23.107]  I believe in it.
[00:34:23.247 --> 00:34:24.208]  It's the real deal.
[00:34:39.778 --> 00:34:42.400]  It's helped me lose over 70 pounds of frickin' fat.
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:43.981]  I gained back about 30-40 pounds of muscle.
[00:34:44.001 --> 00:34:44.702]  I'm a pretty big guy.
[00:34:45.722 --> 00:34:48.864]  And it's incredible what Mother Nature gave us.
[00:34:49.225 --> 00:34:50.726]  And your purchase supports everything we're doing.
[00:34:50.746 --> 00:34:53.287]  But you heard Tim Kennedy, who I never intended to be a sponsor.
[00:34:53.768 --> 00:34:54.148]  I like it.
[00:34:54.208 --> 00:35:01.013]  You know, is it evil of me that I don't want Hillary's camp to start using any of our supplements?
[00:35:01.633 --> 00:35:04.555]  Because she might actually get a little healthier.
[00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:07.617]  You know, we thought of that as a joke to send her some super female vitality.
[00:35:07.637 --> 00:35:08.718]  People said, well, wait, we don't want to help her.
[00:35:08.758 --> 00:35:09.478]  I'm actually helping her.
[00:35:09.658 --> 00:35:11.219]  No, but really, it affects change.
[00:35:11.459 --> 00:35:13.961]  I take super male vitality every single day.
[00:35:14.381 --> 00:35:15.022]  I love it.
[00:35:15.302 --> 00:35:15.962]  My wife loves it.
[00:35:16.783 --> 00:35:19.384]  My coaches love it because I have energy nonstop.
[00:35:19.705 --> 00:35:21.406]  There's a foundation to being an athlete.
[00:35:21.966 --> 00:35:24.227]  No, there's kind of the four cornerstones.
[00:35:24.307 --> 00:35:25.287]  You've got to have healthy sleep.
[00:35:25.707 --> 00:35:32.029]  You have to have that workload, that hard work in the gym or every day and your job, whatever that is, hard workload.
[00:35:32.589 --> 00:35:33.649]  Then you have to be intimate.
[00:35:33.769 --> 00:35:38.130]  You have to be connected with your spouse or whoever you're with.
[00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:39.691]  And then lastly is nutrition.
[00:35:40.231 --> 00:35:44.716]  All of those are equally important, and they all play parts in how you are healthy as a man.
[00:35:45.277 --> 00:35:49.882]  So for me as a male athlete, I have to be intimate with my wife every day, a couple of times a day if I can.
[00:35:49.922 --> 00:35:51.223]  You know, like I have to get good sleep.
[00:35:51.303 --> 00:35:53.826]  I have to have that good work, and I have to have that good food.
[00:35:54.246 --> 00:36:00.954]  And these things, super male vitality, is one of those things that is cornerstone to who I am as an athlete and as a man.

[00:37:05.683 --> 00:37:11.150]  If Hillary Clinton is elected president, she will be the most openly corrupt individual to ever do so.
[00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.112]  Many people are guilty of corruption.
[00:37:13.392 --> 00:37:13.973]  They hide it.
[00:37:14.093 --> 00:37:16.256]  It comes out after they become president.
[00:37:16.876 --> 00:37:24.305]  But Hillary Clinton, we know, going in with these email scandals and massive felonies committed in violation of national security, everyone knows about this.
[00:37:25.206 --> 00:37:36.629]  Judge Napolitano has an interesting article on antiwar.com where he talks to law enforcement sources who give him a chronology and talk about how this went and their lingo sideways.
[00:37:36.689 --> 00:37:38.129]  I think it's important to look at this.
[00:37:38.149 --> 00:37:48.131]  We've talked about the background of James Comey, how he was at the time HSBC was getting multiple convictions on money laundering.
[00:37:48.171 --> 00:37:51.572]  He was on the board of HSBC and it was Loretta Lynch that let them go.
[00:37:52.487 --> 00:37:54.830]  Uh, saying that they're too big to jail.
[00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:58.574]  That was the way Rolling Stone and many people characterized that, rightfully so.
[00:37:59.354 --> 00:38:10.166]  Also, in the past, the two of them had worked together to let Sandy Berger violate national security law, steal classified documents to cover up information that they did not want to get out about the Clintons.
[00:38:10.906 --> 00:38:12.747]  As the 9-11 Commission was operating.
[00:38:12.767 --> 00:38:17.709]  So let's take a look at what Judge Napolitano gives us from his FBI sources.
[00:38:18.149 --> 00:38:21.751]  Now he points out, the FBI began investigating the Clinton email scandal in the spring of 2015.
[00:38:22.691 --> 00:38:33.096]  Six months later, the senior FBI agent in charge of that investigation resigned from the case and retired from the FBI because he felt the case was going sideways.
[00:38:33.136 --> 00:38:36.137]  That's law enforcement jargon for nowhere by design.
[00:38:36.177 --> 00:38:38.358]  They didn't want to get a conviction, in other words, and we knew that.
[00:38:38.938 --> 00:38:41.020]  Now, this was John Giacalone.
[00:38:41.321 --> 00:38:44.223]  He had been a chief of the New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.
[00:38:44.264 --> 00:38:45.645]  field offices of the FBI.
[00:38:46.025 --> 00:38:51.691]  And at the time of his sideways comment, he was chief of FBI National Security Branch.
[00:38:51.711 --> 00:38:53.773]  So this is under his investigation.
[00:38:54.713 --> 00:39:00.697]  Now they say, Giacalone knew that without a grand jury, the FBI would be toothless as it would have no subpoena power.
[00:39:00.917 --> 00:39:10.524]  And if you remember, when we go back and look at the comments that Judge Napolitano was making at the time, he said it's very encouraging to see them giving amnesty to people who were low down in the investigation.
[00:39:10.564 --> 00:39:14.927]  That means that they want to find out what they know so they can use it against the people at the top.
[00:39:14.967 --> 00:39:15.868]  That's what they always do.
[00:39:16.348 --> 00:39:23.353]  And an honest law enforcement agent like Judge Napolitano would know that, would know what the tactics and techniques are, but that doesn't work with the Clintons.
[00:39:23.533 --> 00:39:30.036]  We've seen this 20 years ago with Charlie Tree and what happened to the Chinese money laundering that was going on under Bill Clinton.
[00:39:30.357 --> 00:39:34.039]  They gave Charlie Tree immunity, but they didn't use it to get the Clintons.
[00:39:34.519 --> 00:39:37.440]  They just gave him immunity because he's with the Clintons.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:39.621]  Same thing happened with these investigations.
[00:39:39.661 --> 00:39:46.605]  He talks about it as the investigation dragged on in secret and Donald Trump simultaneously began to rise in Republican presidential primaries.
[00:39:46.965 --> 00:39:51.788]  It became more apparent to Giacalone's successors that the goal of the FBI was to exonerate Clinton.
[00:39:52.389 --> 00:40:02.020]  When she was interviewed on July 2nd, remember, 4th of July weekend, for only four hours, during which the interviewer seemed to summon the bureau to lack aggression, passion, or determination.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.283]  Yeah, they did not want to find anything.
[00:40:04.804 --> 00:40:07.787]  Some FBI agents privately came to the same conclusion as their former boss.
[00:40:07.807 --> 00:40:09.970]  The case was going sideways, they said.
[00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:15.234]  A few determined agents, however, were frustrated by Clinton's professed lack of memory.
[00:40:15.274 --> 00:40:17.336]  Remember, she said, oh, I can't remember any of that stuff.
[00:40:17.356 --> 00:40:20.539]  So they said, all right, let's get some medical information about this.
[00:40:20.599 --> 00:40:32.109]  So they sought, according to Judge Napolitano and his sources inside law enforcement, they sought to obtain her medical records to verify the gravity of her injury and to determine whether she had been truthful with them.
[00:40:32.669 --> 00:40:39.656]  They prepared the paperwork to get the records, only to have their request denied by Director Comey himself on July 4th.
[00:40:40.116 --> 00:40:42.078]  Then some agents did the unthinkable, he said.
[00:40:42.519 --> 00:40:45.021]  They reached out to colleagues in the intelligence community.
[00:40:45.281 --> 00:40:50.186]  They asked them to get the records on Clinton's medical history so they could show them to Comey.
[00:40:50.826 --> 00:40:53.688]  The National Security Agency, as he points out, can access anything.
[00:40:53.948 --> 00:41:01.933]  When Comey learned of these efforts, he headed them off the next morning with his now infamous news conference in which he announced that Clinton would not be indicted.
[00:41:02.093 --> 00:41:02.593]  You understand?
[00:41:03.014 --> 00:41:10.999]  So here you've got a situation where Hillary Clinton claims she has amnesty, or she has amnesia, so she should have amnesty.
[00:41:11.219 --> 00:41:14.501]  She says she has amnesia because of a medical issue.
[00:41:14.841 --> 00:41:17.704]  And they say, well fine, let's see what her true condition is.
[00:41:17.764 --> 00:41:22.007]  But no, we can't have information about Hillary Clinton's true medical conditions either.
[00:41:22.668 --> 00:41:25.410]  Everything must be concealed for Hillary Clinton.
[00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:35.599]  And the FBI agent in charge, the one in charge of everything, Jack Comey, the most politicized FBI agency that people in our lifetime have seen,
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:37.161]  Covers up for her.
[00:41:56.253 --> 00:42:06.297]  We found out that Andrew McKay, who was the successor to Jack O'Loney, head of the FBI Washington field office, presently the number three person in the FBI, is guess what?
[00:42:06.777 --> 00:42:13.480]  Married to a woman to whom the Clinton money machine in Virginia funneled about $675,000 in lawful campaign funds for a failed 2015 run for the Virginia Senate.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:13.940]  You understand?
[00:42:20.462 --> 00:42:21.223]  It's pay for play.
[00:42:21.703 --> 00:42:23.185]  It's the network of cronyism.
[00:42:23.625 --> 00:42:26.327]  It's what we've seen with Hillary Clinton on and on.
[00:42:26.667 --> 00:42:35.575]  It's important to understand that there are people in the government, in the NSA, in the intelligence offices, in the FBI, who know precisely what's going on.
[00:42:35.595 --> 00:42:41.179]  Now, unfortunately, under this corrupt administration, the only option they have is to resign.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:48.806]  They're not going to get anybody in the Obama administration, and they won't get anybody in the Hillary Clinton administration to pay attention to what they're telling us.
[00:42:49.647 --> 00:42:53.350]  But if we have a President Donald Trump, I think that's going to change.
[00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:55.252]  And Judge Napolitano ends with this.
[00:42:55.832 --> 00:42:59.536]  He says, this isn't your grandfather's FBI or your father's FBI.
[00:43:00.056 --> 00:43:01.938]  It's the Obama FBI.
[00:43:02.739 --> 00:43:04.841]  That's the state of
[00:43:06.007 --> 00:43:08.588]  Corruption that we have now in Washington.
[00:43:08.969 --> 00:43:12.631]  Never before has it been this open, this in your face.
[00:43:12.671 --> 00:43:20.235]  Remember, Richard Nixon was impeached because he approached the IRS to do audits against his political enemies.
[00:43:20.375 --> 00:43:22.836]  And the IRS commissioner at the time exposed it.
[00:43:22.856 --> 00:43:23.817]  That's why he was impeached.
[00:43:24.257 --> 00:43:29.580]  Instead, under an Obama administration, the FBI, the corrupt FBI, goes along with him.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.903]  And continues to do it even after it sees the light of day.
[00:43:34.024 --> 00:43:37.747]  Even after everybody knows that this is a politicized attack.
[00:43:38.547 --> 00:43:40.269]  The IRS continues to do so.
[00:43:40.949 --> 00:43:42.871]  The Obama administration continues to do so.
[00:43:43.372 --> 00:43:45.854]  That is a level of corruption that we face.
[00:43:46.474 --> 00:43:47.815]  For M4Wars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:43:57.893 --> 00:44:07.181]  New information coming out about Erica Garner and she's ripping the Clinton camp for WikiLeaks, of course, a series of emails about her father, her dad.
[00:44:07.301 --> 00:44:10.884]  Eric Garner was, of course, killed by police, a chokehold victim.
[00:44:11.304 --> 00:44:21.233]  Hillary Clinton's campaign in a series of tweets on Thursday afternoon, the new campaign emails released by WikiLeaks, they show how Hillary Clinton staffers discussed the death of Erica's father.
[00:44:21.773 --> 00:44:23.655]  This is what Erica had to say about it.
[00:44:23.716 --> 00:44:29.943]  She says, I'm troubled by the revelation that you and this campaign actually discussed using Eric Garner.
[00:44:30.503 --> 00:44:32.105]  Why would you want to use my dad?
[00:44:32.145 --> 00:44:35.729]  Well, Garner tweeted this along with a link to the email release by WikiLeaks.
[00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:39.992]  And I've got news for you, sweetheart, that fits into their narrative well.
[00:44:40.032 --> 00:44:45.955]  They want to incite violence in this country by paying rioters that they can't do it any other way, and they're trying to use this tragedy.
[00:44:45.975 --> 00:44:48.697]  You know, Clinton, she never wasted a tragedy, mind you.
[00:44:49.397 --> 00:44:57.082]  And the unfortunate death of Eric Garner at the hands of police, regardless of the circumstance, they're trying to capitalize it, of course.
[00:44:57.142 --> 00:45:00.664]  And we know this because of WikiLeaks, the cashy dump of emails.
[00:45:01.304 --> 00:45:07.548]  And these tweets reflecting what Erica Garner has to say about Clinton and about how she feels about it.
[00:45:08.329 --> 00:45:10.950]  You know, she's seen speaking in Harlem in April.
[00:45:11.531 --> 00:45:17.455]  And Garner, she's tweeting links as well to hacked emails from the Clinton campaign, John Podesta.
[00:45:18.155 --> 00:45:28.142]  And those were released by WikiLeaks that show this internal communication dialogue between Clinton's top staffers about how best to word an editorial piece on gun violence.
[00:45:28.163 --> 00:45:36.369]  They're trying to use this tragedy to craft a false narrative about gun violence and curbing guns and the Second Amendment in this country.
[00:45:36.409 --> 00:45:37.409]  They're trying to take advantage of it.
[00:45:37.429 --> 00:45:38.510]  You know, we've seen her do this.
[00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:40.652]  We saw her campaign by ads.
[00:45:41.132 --> 00:45:41.432]  I think so.
[00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:00.070]  Thank you.
[00:46:17.937 --> 00:46:47.322]  Regarding a Clinton operative and what he had to say about black voters and capitalizing on their quote-unquote stupidity and we really know how Clinton feels and her staff feels about about black Americans about this community and our nation and we really understand that they're wanting to use them like they've always done they could rely on the black vote to get Democrats into office and we're seeing that blow up in their face because we really know how they feel
[00:46:47.842 --> 00:46:53.451]  Check out this article, Erica Garner rips on ClintonCamp regarding these emails and this latest stump.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.

[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:59.046 --> 00:49:05.729]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:49:05.809 --> 00:49:11.851]  Owen Schroer with you and I'm joined by Jack Posobiec, the Special Operations Director for Citizens for Trump.
[00:49:11.891 --> 00:49:16.173]  He's been very enlightening with some of the intel he's provided us and he's got more intel for us.
[00:49:16.193 --> 00:49:18.113]  We're going to discuss everything election with him.
[00:49:18.154 --> 00:49:19.274]  Jack, thanks for coming on with us again.
[00:49:20.267 --> 00:49:21.167]  Thanks for having me on, Owen.
[00:49:21.287 --> 00:49:22.088]  It's always great to be here.
[00:49:22.768 --> 00:49:30.891]  Well, there's a lot for us to talk about, but I want to talk about first something we were discussing yesterday, and that was the hack of StopTheSteel.
[00:49:31.211 --> 00:49:34.372]  We're getting hacked now when we're trying to watch the polls.
[00:49:34.412 --> 00:49:35.172]  What do you know about this?
[00:49:36.253 --> 00:49:48.737]  So, StopTheSteel.org yesterday suffered a DDoS attack, a Distributed Denial of Service attack, very similar coincidentally to the one that we saw across the entire United States last week.
[00:49:49.130 --> 00:50:09.324]  So a lot of similar fingerprints and some evidence that our tech team is now putting together that seems to be along the same lines of, they can't say specifically who, but we assessed, you know, we think we know who the culprits are, but it's probably the same group that actually shut down the Internet last week, right before Julian Assange went silent.
[00:50:10.273 --> 00:50:20.504]  Yeah, and originally when we were talking, we were both thinking, oh, you know, maybe this is due to overload of traffic because they've been marketing this, they were pushing this on all different platforms, which would have been a good thing.
[00:50:20.524 --> 00:50:21.525]  We said, wow, this is great.
[00:50:21.545 --> 00:50:22.707]  People want to monitor the polls.
[00:50:22.787 --> 00:50:24.268]  All these people are coming to stop the steal.
[00:50:24.508 --> 00:50:28.653]  This is effective marketing to try to keep this election integrity filled.
[00:50:29.113 --> 00:50:31.116]  But we found out, no, it was actually a hack.
[00:50:31.756 --> 00:50:36.359]  And it goes to show you, I think, that anybody is susceptible to hacking.
[00:50:36.399 --> 00:50:37.880]  And this is a nonpartisan issue.
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:42.803]  Whether it's Hillary Clinton's emails or Stop the Steal, is hacking something we're just going to have to deal with now?
[00:50:44.124 --> 00:50:45.105]  That's absolutely right.
[00:50:45.305 --> 00:50:51.048]  And honestly, I've always been a big advocate of telling people that, look, you are going to get hacked.
[00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:53.550]  Your password can get cracked, period.
[00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:57.612]  I don't care how crazy it is and how many different names you use in there.
[00:50:57.853 --> 00:51:00.054]  And that's why I'm a big advocate for encryption.
[00:51:00.452 --> 00:51:02.214]  You have to encrypt your stuff.
[00:51:02.655 --> 00:51:03.736]  End-to-end encryption.
[00:51:03.816 --> 00:51:06.679]  Don't let the keys reside on the server.
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:12.546]  Keep your communications encrypted, and that way, when you do get hacked, nobody's going to be able to see what it was.
[00:51:12.786 --> 00:51:15.690]  And that's just something for your private stuff, not just politics.
[00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:16.851]  Completely nonpartisan.
[00:51:16.871 --> 00:51:19.034]  Just, I don't want people seeing my emails, you know?
[00:51:19.887 --> 00:51:27.151]  Right, and it's just, it's strange because it's becoming something that we see more and more of, and I guess the people obviously hope that it never comes to their front door.
[00:51:27.191 --> 00:51:28.632]  That's always the hope.
[00:51:28.912 --> 00:51:30.473]  Let's get back to the polls for a second here.
[00:51:30.493 --> 00:51:44.001]  Now, we were discussing earlier about how the media polls are saying one thing, internal polling is saying another thing, the eye test is saying something completely different altogether when you talk about rally turnout, but what are you hearing about the media polls right now and their accuracy?
[00:51:45.017 --> 00:51:52.979]  So, Owen, I have some sources that met at the highest levels of the RNC earlier today, and they've showed us basically their internal polls.
[00:51:53.399 --> 00:51:57.060]  And what we're seeing is completely separate from the media polls.
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:02.041]  Now, there are some good scientific polls out there, like Axiom Strategies Group and their battleground studies.
[00:52:02.362 --> 00:52:04.822]  They actually go and target battleground counties.
[00:52:05.062 --> 00:52:11.544]  But those aren't the ones that you're going to see on Wall Street Journal, on CNN, on Fox News, on MSNBC, these mainstream media outlets.
[00:52:11.926 --> 00:52:26.514]  Because all of those ones are throwing these insane, totally off-the-wall, skewed polls out there in an attempt, a PSYOP essentially, to depress Trump voters, to demoralize Trump voters, and to make them think that Hillary is going to win.
[00:52:26.574 --> 00:52:28.715]  Well, there's two issues that have come to play here.
[00:52:28.735 --> 00:52:34.098]  Number one, they realized that they weren't able to demoralize the Trump voters, it just galvanized them further.
[00:52:34.459 --> 00:52:35.019]  And number two,
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:41.823]  It was actually starting to tell Hillary voters to sort of tune out of the race and they didn't care anymore.
[00:52:41.903 --> 00:52:51.208]  So, I think your average Hillary voter that's watching nothing but Rachel Maddow, that guy, and reading Huffington Post thinks the race is over, so hey, why do I have to turn out on November 8th?
[00:52:52.011 --> 00:52:53.752]  Yeah, and we know how they rigged the polls.
[00:52:53.913 --> 00:52:55.614]  Of course, mainstream media is guilty of this.
[00:52:55.654 --> 00:53:00.898]  We see how they skew the numbers based on who they survey, who they poll, favoring Democrats.
[00:53:01.278 --> 00:53:08.404]  And we know how we're trying to keep the integrity of this election with Stop the Steal and doing exit polls and doing poll watching.
[00:53:08.844 --> 00:53:21.034]  Do you think that maybe this has gotten the establishment and the mainstream media scared that the tactics that we're going to use to maintain the integrity of this election with citizen action on the ground, that they might not be able to skew the actual election like they skew the polls?
[00:53:22.023 --> 00:53:24.085]  I absolutely think it's got them scared.
[00:53:24.125 --> 00:53:28.588]  You know, General Patton once said that you're taking the most flak when you know you're right over the target.
[00:53:28.948 --> 00:53:32.030]  And I think that's exactly the situation we find ourselves in today.
[00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:46.220]  There have been no less than, I think, a dozen articles written in the mainstream media and the liberal press, the Daily Beast, you know the ones, about Stop the Steal and about what Citizens for Trump and MAGA 3X are going to be doing on Election Day.
[00:53:46.638 --> 00:53:49.199]  And all we're saying, and they're calling us everything under the sun.
[00:53:49.239 --> 00:53:53.501]  They're calling us racist, misogynist, targeting minorities, vote intimidation.
[00:53:53.901 --> 00:53:55.262]  And all we're saying is, whoa, whoa.
[00:53:55.942 --> 00:54:06.026]  Citizens for Trump with Stop the Steal and Operation MAGA 3X, all we're doing is we're doing basic exit polling for these polls.
[00:54:06.406 --> 00:54:12.869]  And we are going to have citizens going out and essentially keeping an eye on what's going on in the world.
[00:54:14.022 --> 00:54:18.825]  That's all we're trying to do, and there's nothing covert, there's nothing clandestine about this.
[00:54:18.865 --> 00:54:20.926]  It's completely open and to the public.
[00:54:21.186 --> 00:54:25.869]  But for some reason, it's got the mainstream media and the establishment incredibly scared.
[00:54:26.155 --> 00:54:34.085]  Well and think about this, we've got the Democratic operatives, the left side of this, the Hillary Clinton side of this, that have been caught breaking the law.
[00:54:34.205 --> 00:54:42.355]  In multiple different laws, electioneering laws, voter intimidation laws, we've been caught, they've been caught, and there seems to be no action here.
[00:54:42.696 --> 00:54:44.979]  So it's amazing, you know what, this is kind of what it says to me.
[00:54:45.479 --> 00:54:50.166]  If my government is going to ignore this, and if my government is not going to take action, well, you know what?
[00:54:50.286 --> 00:54:51.447]  This is my government.
[00:54:51.668 --> 00:54:52.809]  I am we the people.
[00:54:53.029 --> 00:54:54.191]  So I'm going to take action.
[00:54:54.231 --> 00:54:55.072]  And that's kind of what this is.
[00:54:55.092 --> 00:54:56.915]  This is a citizen's movement.
[00:54:56.955 --> 00:55:00.459]  This is a grassroots movement to ensure the integrity of the election.
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:02.883]  And there's no laws being broken, by the way.
[00:55:04.232 --> 00:55:05.032]  Not a single one.
[00:55:05.072 --> 00:55:10.534]  We actually have several lawyers that are completely nonpartisan that are coming on that are going to be helping us.
[00:55:10.834 --> 00:55:19.418]  I just had a very lengthy email chain with one earlier today going through, okay, what specifically are the distances that someone has to stay from the polls?
[00:55:19.758 --> 00:55:20.718]  What can you wear?
[00:55:20.818 --> 00:55:22.879]  What can you not wear if you're doing the polling?
[00:55:24.179 --> 00:55:33.623]  We are going in to make sure that every single thing is in compliance with the law and that we are using scientific methodology, the same methodology that's employed by, or at least
[00:55:34.048 --> 00:55:39.853]  Supposedly employed by every single major news agency and university that conducts exit polling.
[00:55:40.813 --> 00:55:50.561]  And now we're seeing more WikiLeaks to kind of move the conversation along a little bit of Hillary Clinton perhaps making illegal offers with Supreme Court justices' seats.
[00:55:50.581 --> 00:55:51.362]  What do you know about this?
[00:55:52.342 --> 00:56:02.591]  So late last night I got across my desk one of the new WikiLeaks and buried deep within an email chain from John Podesta was a discussion regarding the
[00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:04.971]  The MP seat on the Supreme Court.
[00:56:04.991 --> 00:56:07.372]  So we've currently only got eight seats on the Supreme Court.
[00:56:07.812 --> 00:56:16.497]  They suggested appointing someone who is a federal judge currently, but is also the sister-in-law of the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan.
[00:56:16.897 --> 00:56:24.061]  Now this email came out for several months ago, way before any of the GOP sabotage and the attempted Paul Ryan coup ever took place.
[00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:30.364]  So when all that was going down, and currently a lot of people are wondering, you know, what was the deal?
[00:56:30.485 --> 00:56:31.185]  What was struck?
[00:56:31.533 --> 00:56:33.494]  What was used to buy off Paul Ryan?
[00:56:33.534 --> 00:56:36.816]  Because Paul Ryan is clearly campaigning for Hillary Clinton at this point.
[00:56:37.076 --> 00:56:40.138]  We're now seeing the RNC cut ads for Hillary Clinton at this point.
[00:56:40.178 --> 00:56:44.881]  So what were some of the actual, you know, favors that were promised to them as part of this deal?
[00:56:45.222 --> 00:56:52.206]  And now, according to WikiLeaks, we now have some evidence that a Supreme Court seat offer may have been made to Paul Ryan's sister-in-law.
[00:56:52.898 --> 00:56:55.259]  Yeah, I'm sure there will be no investigation of this at all.
[00:56:55.299 --> 00:56:56.780]  The FBI is completely incompetent.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:57.821]  We covered that earlier.
[00:56:58.161 --> 00:57:00.322]  And now let's talk about some of the GOP smearing of Trump.
[00:57:00.762 --> 00:57:04.404]  And you mentioned the ads, but think about this, and you can mention those again in a second.
[00:57:04.744 --> 00:57:11.348]  But I'm sorry, I remember a certain pledge that the Republican establishment made Donald Trump take.
[00:57:11.408 --> 00:57:12.609]  I recall a pledge.
[00:57:13.189 --> 00:57:15.730]  Oh, but I guess they didn't have to honor that pledge, did they?
[00:57:15.850 --> 00:57:16.611]  There was a pledge?
[00:57:16.631 --> 00:57:17.391]  Did we sign a pledge?
[00:57:17.411 --> 00:57:17.871]  What was that?
[00:57:17.891 --> 00:57:18.552]  A pledge, yeah.
[00:57:18.592 --> 00:57:19.392]  They seem to forgot.
[00:57:19.612 --> 00:57:22.274]  They forgot the pledge as soon as Donald Trump became the nominee.
[00:57:23.407 --> 00:57:29.590]  Well, you've seen the same people that they get up and swear to the Constitution, and they completely break that.
[00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:33.251]  So it doesn't surprise me, not the least, that all of them are breaking.
[00:57:33.271 --> 00:57:36.133]  The RNC is breaking the RNC's own pledge.
[00:57:36.473 --> 00:57:45.057]  They're now running anti-Trump ads for Republican candidates that have, quote unquote, stood up to Donald Trump in districts across the United States.
[00:57:45.577 --> 00:57:48.438]  They're refusing to pay staffers, their own staffers.
[00:57:48.718 --> 00:57:52.440]  So the RNC is refusing to pay RNC staffers that support Trump.
[00:57:53.170 --> 00:58:01.554]  There is a wholesale schism going on, the likes of which we haven't seen in, you know, hundreds of years in politics within the GOP.
[00:58:01.774 --> 00:58:05.195]  And basically it's, are you with the establishment or are you with the people?
[00:58:05.915 --> 00:58:14.619]  Right now, short answer, Jack, the Special Operations Director for Citizens for Trump, where do you think Trump stands as far as getting 270 in the Electoral College?
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:17.580]  Well, I think the fight is currently Florida.
[00:58:17.961 --> 00:58:19.001]  I think that, uh,
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:20.940]  Trump is going to do very well there.
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.961]  I think he's going to do a lot better than people think.
[00:58:23.421 --> 00:58:26.922]  But it's definitely a street fight that he finds himself in.
[00:58:26.942 --> 00:58:28.342]  And Hillary Clinton knows that, too.
[00:58:28.702 --> 00:58:32.823]  The difference is that Trump supporters are much, much more motivated.
[00:58:33.103 --> 00:58:37.824]  And the enthusiasm gap that you've seen with these rallies is what's going to be able to sustain him.
[00:58:37.844 --> 00:58:44.766]  And that is the reason they are pushing this PSYOP as hard as they can with these false polls and this narrative that the race is already over.
[00:58:45.166 --> 00:58:47.367]  If Trump supporters remain vigilant,
[00:58:48.672 --> 00:58:54.975]  If people use the MAGA 3X operation that we've talked about, bring three extra voters out to the polls with you, Hillary doesn't stand a chance.
[00:58:55.576 --> 00:58:56.596]  Could not agree more.
[00:58:56.676 --> 00:58:58.157]  Thank you, Jack, for joining us.
