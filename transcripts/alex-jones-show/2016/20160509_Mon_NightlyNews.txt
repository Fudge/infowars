[00:00:20.114 --> 00:00:21.715]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.895 --> 00:00:22.576]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:22.776 --> 00:00:23.657]  It's Monday, May 9th, 2016.
[00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:24.578]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:32.893 --> 00:00:42.082]  As millions of students prepare to graduate, they'll be bombarded by liberal speakers at a rate of six for every one conservative.
[00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:46.086]  Then, what you need to know about Brexit.
[00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:48.608]  After that... Lovely!
[00:00:49.088 --> 00:00:50.269]  You bastard!
[00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.310]  What have you done?
[00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.813]  That's not your mother, it's a man, baby!
[00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:58.654]  How will people react if someone of the wrong gender walks into the privy?
[00:00:59.594 --> 00:01:03.975]  And, social media doubles down on steering public opinion.
[00:01:04.695 --> 00:01:05.355]  That's next!
[00:01:20.998 --> 00:01:22.420]  I mean, it's just so obvious.
[00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:24.784]  Why would anyone listen to scum?
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:03.334 --> 00:03:14.201]  Well, you would think that they had all of the important issues solved, but we've got Obama and his Attorney General Loretta Lynch having a news conference today talking about how they're going to sue the state of North Carolina.
[00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:19.985]  We'll get to the Lynch mob and the gay KK in just a moment, but first I want to talk about what happened in London over the weekend.
[00:03:20.205 --> 00:03:38.112]  Breitbart reports that Muslims reading the advert are told that to, quote, gather the rewards of Ramadan, unquote, they must donate to Islamic Relief, an organization which had its accounts with banking giant HSBC closed after, quote, concerns that cash for aid could end up with terrorist groups abroad.
[00:03:38.732 --> 00:03:46.998]  Now remember, we've reported multiple times about all the money laundering issues that HSBC has had with drug cartels, as well as with terrorist organizations.
[00:03:47.478 --> 00:03:57.365]  For them to close these accounts is troubling, especially considering the fact that the new mayor had questions about his relationships with different organizations during the campaign.
[00:03:57.385 --> 00:04:00.127]  Those were dismissed as simply racist.
[00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:04.910]  And so the question is, is London transitioning into Arabia?
[00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.212]  I mean, are they trans-Islamic here?
[00:04:07.592 --> 00:04:27.149]  The new campaign came the day after London crowned its first Muslim leader, Mayor Sadiq Khan, and Islamic Relief, again remember this is the organization that the large bank that has been involved in more money laundering, convicted of more money laundering issues than any other large bank, HSBC, suspended their account.
[00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:29.812]  Islamic Relief called it a nice irony.
[00:04:30.032 --> 00:04:30.532]  How about that?
[00:04:30.572 --> 00:04:33.195]  A nice irony that the two events coincided.
[00:04:33.775 --> 00:04:40.023]  Now Breitbart points out that the phrase that's on here, glory to Allah, is often mistranslated as glory to God.
[00:04:40.563 --> 00:04:49.274]  In the same way that Allah Akbar is often translated as God is great, but it really means in Arabic, our God, Allah, is greater than yours.
[00:04:49.654 --> 00:04:55.437]  Now, this might just be a lot of people complaining because they don't like to see Islamic slogans on buses, right?
[00:04:55.897 --> 00:05:05.402]  No, the issue here is the fact that they have continually suppressed Christian groups putting the same kinds of religious ads on buses.
[00:05:05.442 --> 00:05:09.264]  For example, they point out Christian groups fared less well with London buses.
[00:05:09.344 --> 00:05:17.148]  The then mayor, Boris Johnson, stepped in to ban a message by a Christian group in response to a pro-gay advertising campaign.
[00:05:17.788 --> 00:05:21.931]  A group called Stonewall told Londoners, some people are gay, get over it.
[00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:27.935]  Then there was a Christian group that came out and said, not gay, ex-gay, post-gay, and proud.
[00:05:28.235 --> 00:05:28.795]  Get over it.
[00:05:28.875 --> 00:05:30.617]  Well, that message was shut down.
[00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:33.599]  It was challenged, but it was left to stand.
[00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:34.839]  It was not found to be unlawful.
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.021]  And then this one, which was even more interesting.
[00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:52.236]  Last November, the Church of England, the official church of the British government, we don't have an official church here in America, but they do in England, and it's supposed to be the Church of England, they decided they would do a commercial that they'll be shown in movie theaters about the Lord's Prayer.
[00:05:52.296 --> 00:05:53.196]  So they had a lot of people.
[00:05:53.216 --> 00:05:54.318]  It was a 60-second spot.
[00:05:54.778 --> 00:05:59.623]  They featured a farmer, a weightlifter, gospel singers, children, even the Archbishop of Canterbury.
[00:06:00.183 --> 00:06:06.228]  Praying just before the new Star Wars film was going to open up, but it was banned by the different cinema chains.
[00:06:06.288 --> 00:06:15.135]  It was blocked by Digital Cinema Media, DCM, the agency that controls advertising for Britain's biggest cinema chains, including Odeon, View, and Cinema World.
[00:06:15.576 --> 00:06:19.719]  The Church of England called the decision chilling in terms of free speech.
[00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:28.026]  And so you have to ask yourself, is the real Church of England the state church, or is it a state mosque now?
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.204]  Because Islamic messages are allowed to be put on the buses, but Christian messages are suppressed.
[00:06:34.845 --> 00:06:39.909]  And you might say, well, you know, we don't want anybody coming after the homosexuals, okay?
[00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:42.791]  But look at what's happening with our allies.
[00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:44.352]  ISIS, Saudi Arabia.
[00:06:44.372 --> 00:06:51.097]  As Jonathan Turley points out, ISIS cleanses a gay man of sins by stoning him and then throwing him off the top of a building.
[00:06:51.137 --> 00:06:52.118]  This is not something new.
[00:06:52.158 --> 00:06:54.259]  This is something that happens all the time.
[00:06:55.134 --> 00:06:59.517]  But the left is swallowing a camel while they strain at a gnat.
[00:06:59.577 --> 00:07:01.159]  And we're going to look at that in just a moment.
[00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:07.724]  And they point out that within Sharia law, they say they can cleanse a man of his sins by this execution.
[00:07:08.184 --> 00:07:11.006]  This is the medieval system of Sharia law, as he points out.
[00:07:11.326 --> 00:07:15.350]  The Sharia faux court explained that throwing gaze this way cleanses their sins.
[00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:22.259]  And he also points out that our closest allies, Saudi Arabia, also use Sharia law.
[00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:23.741]  They use the death penalty.
[00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:25.283]  They criminalize homosexuality.
[00:07:25.884 --> 00:07:32.152]  Saudi prosecutors are reportedly seeking the death penalty for dozens of people right now who admit that they are homosexuals.
[00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:35.856]  Why do we work so closely with Saudi Arabia?
[00:07:35.876 --> 00:07:38.259]  As a matter of fact, why do we work so closely with ISIS?
[00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:42.783]  People are not admitting that we work with ISIS, but we have documented over and over again how the U.S.
[00:07:42.823 --> 00:07:54.896]  government, the CIA, via Turkey and other methods, have been supplying ISIS with weapons just as we supplied Al-Qaeda with weapons when they were called Mujahideen and also when they were called Al-Qaeda as well.
[00:07:55.336 --> 00:08:02.804]  Well, of course, this brings it back to the missing 28 pages and CIA Director John Brennan saying that we're going to protect Saudi Arabia.
[00:08:03.145 --> 00:08:16.660]  As a matter of fact, we've got the Obama administration lobbying against releasing these pages, lobbying against the compensation bills that are going through the Congress that have overwhelming majority of people from both parties who say that
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:27.224]  If the Saudis were shown to be complicit in aiding what they consider to be the true narrative of this, that there were 19 hijackers that took this down, of course that's the official story.
[00:08:28.084 --> 00:08:33.386]  And as Senator Bob Graham has said, that could not have happened without help inside the United States.
[00:08:33.466 --> 00:08:34.267]  Of course that's true.
[00:08:34.327 --> 00:08:35.967]  That's only one aspect of it.
[00:08:36.447 --> 00:08:37.628]  But if we're going to have that,
[00:08:38.388 --> 00:08:43.935]  We need to understand, if they're going to throw the Saudis under the bus, we need to understand that there needs to be some compensation for victims.
[00:08:43.995 --> 00:08:44.896]  But they don't want to do that.
[00:08:44.916 --> 00:08:48.821]  They don't want the story, the official conspiracy theory, to begin to unravel.
[00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:54.788]  And they don't want to pull back from their allies, the Saudis, even though they execute homosexuals.
[00:08:55.489 --> 00:08:57.130]  And yet the Obama administration
[00:08:57.972 --> 00:09:03.975]  We'll throw out this and stop the presses, have a massive press conference this afternoon.
[00:09:04.035 --> 00:09:13.399]  So Attorney General Loretta Lynch, even though we have no other problems to solve, we don't have any problems with the border, we don't have any problems with national security and the violation of national security by the Secretary of State.
[00:09:13.439 --> 00:09:23.143]  No, the most important, stop the presses press conference they had this afternoon, absolutely outraged and indignant that there would be bathroom laws in North Carolina.
[00:09:23.843 --> 00:09:27.424]  This is simply to divide and distract the country.
[00:09:28.165 --> 00:09:38.809]  Because this could have been handled any number of ways at either the city level, the state level, or the federal level to respect private property, to respect people's free choices.
[00:09:39.289 --> 00:09:50.834]  And yet, now we see today, we've got North Carolina first suing the Justice Department after they threatened to withhold federal funding for education, and then we have the feds counter-suing North Carolina.
[00:09:50.854 --> 00:09:51.614]  And when I talk about
[00:09:52.014 --> 00:09:55.216]  The lynch mob and the gay KK, this is what the feds are saying.
[00:09:55.256 --> 00:10:01.359]  Attorney General Loretta Lynch compared House Bill 2 in North Carolina to Jim Crow laws.
[00:10:01.999 --> 00:10:07.162]  She says, this law provides no benefit to society, all it does is harm innocent Americans.
[00:10:07.182 --> 00:10:09.023]  Well, I think both sides are saying that.
[00:10:09.403 --> 00:10:14.326]  And when we look at where this originally started, this was, this began in Charlotte.
[00:10:14.386 --> 00:10:17.087]  We had an LGBT chamber president
[00:10:17.819 --> 00:10:21.804]  And he stepped down after people learned of his sex offender status.
[00:10:21.844 --> 00:10:30.193]  We had a situation where nobody was telling anybody what to do with bathrooms other than saying you have to have this many stalls in a bathroom if you have this much square footage.
[00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:43.357]  Then you had the LGBT Chamber of Commerce in Charlotte come up with a law making new demands on people, not respecting people's private choices, not respecting their private property.
[00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:55.823]  At that point, the North Carolina state government had an opportunity to do something that was reasonable and say you're not going to dictate to people what they can do with their private businesses, with their churches, but they didn't do that.
[00:10:56.104 --> 00:11:00.046]  Instead, the ball was in their court and they hit it back and came back in an attack mode.
[00:11:00.786 --> 00:11:08.112]  Now it has escalated to the Feds, who have absolutely no authority to get involved in this under the 9th and the 10th Amendment.
[00:11:08.872 --> 00:11:14.616]  As the North Carolina lawsuit states, they said this is simply a common sense bodily privacy law.
[00:11:14.656 --> 00:11:21.261]  Well, it should have been privacy and private property and the 10th Amendment, but instead they chose to escalate this.
[00:11:21.902 --> 00:11:29.508]  But what they are characterizing the moves by the federal government to be a radical reinterpretation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.
[00:11:30.228 --> 00:11:34.609]  Governor McCrory blamed the city of Charlotte for raising the issue of gender identity in the first place.
[00:11:34.689 --> 00:11:38.571]  And of course, as I pointed out, it was from the LGBT group in Charlotte.
[00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:49.674]  He said the matter was not on the state's agenda until the city imposed a mandate that caused major privacy concerns about males entering female facilities and females entering male facilities.
[00:11:50.174 --> 00:11:52.115]  So they bounced this back and forth.
[00:11:52.315 --> 00:11:55.896]  And it's interesting, I think, to note that the guy who started all of this
[00:11:56.696 --> 00:12:07.825]  was Chad Severance Turner, a man who is on a sex offender list because he was found guilty of fondling a 15-year-old teenage church member while the boy slept.
[00:12:08.205 --> 00:12:23.818]  This is the guy that began everything, that did not want to leave the status quo where it had been, and now we have the Justice Department, so-called Justice Department, the lynch mob, escalating this now, finding new rights, new ways to distract people from real issues.
[00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:26.591]  And here's another example.
[00:12:27.012 --> 00:12:30.956]  And I'm going to tell you how this plays into new rights that have been found.
[00:12:31.096 --> 00:12:36.021]  This is a case in Seattle of a grandmother, actually a great-grandmother.
[00:12:36.682 --> 00:12:41.307]  She's a grandmother of three and a grandmother of eight and a great-grandmother of three.
[00:12:41.387 --> 00:12:41.828]  She's 80 years old.
[00:12:43.109 --> 00:12:48.935]  And she heard a noise in her house in Seattle and she found their husband coming back towards her.
[00:12:48.975 --> 00:12:50.557]  He had been stabbed and hit with a crowbar.
[00:12:50.597 --> 00:12:51.618]  He told her what had happened.
[00:12:51.919 --> 00:12:52.980]  It was a home invasion.
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:58.486]  She ran to the back, got her .38, came out, shot and killed the home intruder.
[00:12:59.269 --> 00:13:05.699]  Now, she said that she felt like if she hadn't, her son and she, as well as her husband, would all be dead.
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.343]  That her husband might have bled to death on the kitchen floor.
[00:13:08.383 --> 00:13:14.472]  She said, you know, never in my whole life did I ever anticipate having to take another life, especially at the age of 80.
[00:13:15.618 --> 00:13:26.744]  Authorities investigating the case believe that Shepard, the person shot, the person doing the home invasion, may have been looking for prescription drugs to steal when he was disturbed by the husband, Mr. Moulds.
[00:13:27.385 --> 00:13:32.327]  Now, I've got to tell you, this reflects when I saw this very much on a personal story in my life.
[00:13:33.588 --> 00:13:36.270]  My aunt and uncle, back in 1986, were murdered.
[00:13:39.341 --> 00:13:43.165]  Not with a home intrusion, but with a renter that they rented to.
[00:13:43.705 --> 00:13:48.650]  Someone that now we have Obama warning landlords that criminals have a right to rent.
[00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:54.615]  The individual that they rented to was a man who had been found guilty and served time for rape.
[00:13:55.436 --> 00:13:57.318]  Now, my aunt and uncle were very old at the time.
[00:13:57.338 --> 00:13:58.419]  They were in their seventies.
[00:13:59.219 --> 00:14:00.541]  There was no internet, of course.
[00:14:00.641 --> 00:14:03.984]  And of course, if there had been, they probably wouldn't have used it to check his background.
[00:14:04.628 --> 00:14:08.731]  But now Obama is telling landlords that criminals have a right to rent from you.
[00:14:08.751 --> 00:14:14.176]  You can't say, I'm not going to rent to this person because they're a violent felon, because they raped or killed somebody.
[00:14:14.196 --> 00:14:18.699]  I'm not going to be allowed to discriminate against them because I might be sued.
[00:14:18.719 --> 00:14:20.340]  Well, let me tell you what happened to my aunt and uncle.
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.583]  Unfortunately, neither of them had a firearm.
[00:14:24.451 --> 00:14:25.792]  Now, they were both very poor.
[00:14:26.573 --> 00:14:32.338]  The amount of rent that this guy was behind was about $250, which represented several months worth of rent.
[00:14:32.438 --> 00:14:33.959]  They lived in the same place.
[00:14:33.999 --> 00:14:34.840]  It was a duplex.
[00:14:35.861 --> 00:14:41.886]  He paid them the rent and then came back later in the night, very angry, broke into the apartment and butchered both of them.
[00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:51.794]  To the extent that the person who was reading the, describing the case, the police lieutenant, broke down on the stand.
[00:14:53.172 --> 00:15:07.495]  And as I think about Mother's Day and what my cousins have to remember how their parents left this world, and I look at what Obama is doing with these laws, I have to say, this is the kind of insanity that we see.
[00:15:07.635 --> 00:15:20.498]  Discovering these new rights and telling us that we have to put our lives in danger because the Obama administration and their Justice Department, which is now down in Charlotte, is telling us, well, we think that we have committed to prison
[00:15:21.198 --> 00:15:28.181]  found guilty a larger percentage of black people and Hispanics and so therefore we're not going to let you discriminate against felons.
[00:15:29.101 --> 00:15:33.803]  Well if that's the case, if they put these people away simply because they're black or Hispanic
[00:15:34.741 --> 00:15:39.024]  That should be something we should reform with the Justice Department, and that may very well be the case.
[00:15:39.385 --> 00:15:42.147]  However, they're the ones who found them guilty.
[00:15:42.207 --> 00:15:43.588]  They're the ones who put them in jail.
[00:15:43.628 --> 00:15:50.854]  They're the ones who identified them as dangerous individuals, and conduct is not something that we cannot discriminate against.
[00:15:51.154 --> 00:15:54.477]  As a matter of fact, conduct is something that we must discriminate against.
[00:15:55.197 --> 00:15:56.518]  Our lives are at stake.
[00:15:57.219 --> 00:16:00.902]  I don't want to see this happen to anybody else but happen to my family.
[00:16:01.523 --> 00:16:09.010]  And yet we have the Obama administration saying that if you refuse to rent to somebody who is a convicted criminal then they can sue you.
[00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:10.151]  And guess what?
[00:16:10.532 --> 00:16:14.635]  The person that is putting this out is HUD Secretary Julian Castro.
[00:16:15.576 --> 00:16:19.457]  One of the people who is now in the veep stakes for Hillary Clinton.
[00:16:20.077 --> 00:16:25.778]  He and his brother, his brother is mayor in San Antonio, they are brushing up on their Spanish.
[00:16:26.398 --> 00:16:34.380]  The two of them are the spawn of a Chicano activist who has turned them into revolutionaries and now they would like to be vice president of this country.
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:44.822]  His organization, HUD, says that landlords may be allowed to bar those with criminal records from living in a facility, but they have to prove that such a policy is necessary for protecting the safety of other tenants.
[00:16:45.402 --> 00:16:47.948]  And it's designed to avoid illegal discrimination.
[00:16:47.988 --> 00:16:48.550]  Yeah, there you go.
[00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:54.544]  So the burden of proof is on you, even though the government says that they have proved these are violent individuals.
[00:16:55.475 --> 00:17:05.518]  And along the same line, look at what has happened in Virginia with Terry McAuliffe, a guy who has been nothing but a political operative for the Clintons, for the DNC.
[00:17:05.818 --> 00:17:11.059]  He is now governor of Virginia, having had no experience in anything other than those types of politics.
[00:17:11.519 --> 00:17:16.781]  This is the same guy who a few months ago, along with his Democrat attorney general, decided that they were going to revoke
[00:17:17.301 --> 00:17:25.451]  The carry permits from about 25 states, if I remember correctly, saying that we're not going to have reciprocity.
[00:17:25.551 --> 00:17:36.544]  Now they're going to, after they reject people's ability to carry weapons to protect themselves, after they tell us that we have to have convicted felons in our rental property,
[00:17:37.245 --> 00:17:41.191]  Now they're going to tell us that they want these same felons to be able to vote.
[00:17:41.712 --> 00:17:48.261]  And they're going to restore their voting rights for 206,000 ex-felons in Virginia.
[00:17:48.462 --> 00:17:50.765]  And we know what's behind that, don't we?
[00:17:51.854 --> 00:18:04.798]  Now the people in the Virginia legislature who pushed back on this open carry permit issue and got them to back down from that are also saying you cannot restore these voting rights in a blanket manner.
[00:18:05.198 --> 00:18:07.039]  That is against the law in Virginia.
[00:18:07.479 --> 00:18:13.761]  But when has something being against the law ever stopped the Hillary Clinton Democrats?
[00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:15.542]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:18:33.842 --> 00:18:34.603]  Yeah!
[00:18:35.403 --> 00:18:36.164]  Score!
[00:18:37.925 --> 00:18:39.826]  Goal!
[00:18:40.186 --> 00:18:41.207]  Goal!
[00:19:04.906 --> 00:19:09.309]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.091]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.773 --> 00:19:15.774]  And to look at that threat we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.435 --> 00:19:27.183]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type 1 civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.854 --> 00:19:39.220]  You could say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:50.126]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.

[00:23:02.847 --> 00:23:03.327]  Welcome back.
[00:23:03.687 --> 00:23:08.628]  Joining me now is Leanne McAdoo, and we're here to talk about what's going on with Facebook.
[00:23:08.668 --> 00:23:14.089]  Are they really honestly portraying the trending stories, or are they rigging it?
[00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:27.692]  You know, we're told, Leanne, that, or at least we're left with the impression, this is something that's being done honestly, without the intervention of humans, maybe, you know, implied that it's being done by an algorithm, and yet whistleblowers are telling us that's not what happened at all, right?
[00:23:28.012 --> 00:23:28.732]  Right, absolutely.
[00:23:28.772 --> 00:23:30.673]  And you know, this is no surprise to us.
[00:23:30.713 --> 00:23:33.914]  We've been talking for years about our articles being suppressed.
[00:23:33.954 --> 00:23:39.035]  People are trying to share some InfoWars articles on Facebook and they're not able to.
[00:23:39.055 --> 00:23:47.497]  Or someone will post something anti-Hillary Clinton and Facebook will determine that it violates their terms of service.
[00:23:47.577 --> 00:23:50.618]  Meanwhile, you can keep an assassinate Donald Trump page up there.
[00:23:51.578 --> 00:23:52.618]  And it's completely fine.
[00:23:52.818 --> 00:23:53.919]  No violation of service.
[00:23:54.279 --> 00:24:03.661]  Well, now we do have some former Facebook workers, they were all employed as contractors, and they came out saying, we routinely suppressed conservative news.
[00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:07.922]  And it was all just willy-nilly based on whoever was on the shift that day.
[00:24:08.422 --> 00:24:14.083]  If they felt like something was newsworthy, they could inject it into the trending news, or if it was
[00:24:14.423 --> 00:24:15.404]  It didn't have to be trending.
[00:24:15.444 --> 00:24:19.269]  According to the algorithms, they could take a story that they wanted to promote and stick it in there.
[00:24:19.289 --> 00:24:22.572]  A story that was trending that they didn't agree with, they could pull out.
[00:24:22.592 --> 00:24:31.883]  And of course, Zuckerberg has been very outspoken about his globalist beliefs and attacking Donald Trump and many other issues that he's very outspoken about.
[00:24:31.923 --> 00:24:34.146]  So it's not a surprise that they would do this.
[00:24:34.366 --> 00:24:34.546]  Right.
[00:24:34.727 --> 00:24:36.549]  And we've seen this kind of across the board.
[00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:44.519]  Whereas you speak with algorithm, we know that Google's algorithm is so important it can crush companies entirely.
[00:24:44.899 --> 00:24:45.820]  And it's the same with them.
[00:24:45.901 --> 00:24:47.643]  It's not just some arbitrary algorithm.
[00:24:47.683 --> 00:24:52.068]  There are actually people in there that you can call and say, hey, you know what's going on here?
[00:24:52.168 --> 00:24:52.949]  Same with Facebook.
[00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:56.752]  And so they have omitted conservative topics from their trending list.
[00:24:56.792 --> 00:25:05.718]  Meanwhile, they made the Black Lives Matter movement trend by the inserting it into the news feed because it wasn't trending and people were saying, well, hey, this is really important.
[00:25:05.758 --> 00:25:07.259]  You should make this go viral.
[00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:08.099]  And so they did.
[00:25:08.659 --> 00:25:17.485]  And then, of course, you know, you hear in the media how powerful Black Lives Matter is in social media, but it's not because the whole system is rigged because it suits a certain agenda.
[00:25:17.825 --> 00:25:22.867]  And even before this broke with the whistleblowers, we'd seen indications that, of course, this was going on.
[00:25:23.187 --> 00:25:28.589]  You had in the question and answer periods, it was put in there, hey, should we spike Trump or should we attack Trump?
[00:25:28.609 --> 00:25:31.630]  What should we do to take this guy down is one of the questions.
[00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:32.950]  Right!
[00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:40.753]  I guess they do like an inner office poll there every single week, and that was one of their actual polls that they have between the employees.
[00:25:41.413 --> 00:25:41.793]  It said,
[00:25:43.974 --> 00:25:49.815]  Specifically, what responsibility does Facebook have to help prevent President Trump in 2017?
[00:25:50.616 --> 00:25:51.136]  Responsibility.
[00:25:51.156 --> 00:25:58.937]  That's their responsibility that they have as this business who is trying to put themselves out there as this non-biased news aggregator.
[00:25:58.957 --> 00:26:09.620]  See, that's the problem I have, is that when people put themselves out there as being non-biased, you have to understand that either they're not being honest with themselves about their own biases,
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.562]  Or they're being very dishonest with you because everybody has biases.
[00:26:13.702 --> 00:26:23.006]  What you choose to report, the analysis that you give it, that's why I always prefer to get my news from a source that was upfront about its biases.
[00:26:23.026 --> 00:26:27.408]  I would like to go to opinion journals that were conservative or libertarian or liberal even.
[00:26:27.448 --> 00:26:32.630]  I would go to Mother Jones or whatever and say, what are the progressive socialists saying about this?
[00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:39.273]  I would like to see the clash of ideas and people who are upfront and honest about what those ideas are rather than hiding
[00:26:39.933 --> 00:26:40.314]  I think so.
[00:26:56.334 --> 00:26:56.494]  That's
[00:27:15.677 --> 00:27:22.584]  Because it's important for people to understand that just because it's an algorithm, just because it's a robot that's doing it, doesn't mean that it isn't rigged completely.
[00:27:22.945 --> 00:27:28.531]  I mean, they can hard bake that in and make it more obvious than they can with a human who's coming in who will blow the whistle on them.
[00:27:28.551 --> 00:27:31.414]  The software isn't going to blow the whistle on this, okay?
[00:27:31.434 --> 00:27:33.116]  They can rig it just like they rig elections.
[00:27:33.536 --> 00:27:47.391]  Well, and of course it's going to start to see that specific topics are continually suppressed and then so that's how it learns, okay, well these topics, these websites aren't important and I should never allow these things to start trending.
[00:27:47.671 --> 00:27:50.214]  So it starts to learn from the human who's teaching it.
[00:27:50.754 --> 00:27:53.975]  Don't don't give any attention to these conservative points of view.
[00:27:54.916 --> 00:28:01.799]  So you have news sites such as the Drudge Report, Breitbart, Newsmax, Washington Examiner, and of course InfoWars.
[00:28:02.119 --> 00:28:13.183]  And so what they were forced to do is if we had a breaking story come out, they would have to wait until an establishment media source like the New York Times or something reported on it as well.
[00:28:13.564 --> 00:28:17.465]  And then they would they would post it from that establishment site.
[00:28:17.905 --> 00:28:19.206]  And they say, I take their spin.
[00:28:19.426 --> 00:28:22.328]  We'd have to choose the one that had the least amount of bias.
[00:28:22.748 --> 00:28:26.210]  But if it's liberal bias, totally fine.
[00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:32.334]  So if somebody would take our story, water it down, spin it, misrepresent it, and label it a conspiracy theory, then they would link to that.
[00:28:32.394 --> 00:28:37.277]  And of course, you don't have to have something that is AI that is learning heuristically about this.
[00:28:37.457 --> 00:28:42.960]  You can just put a filter in there and say, hey, if it matches these terms or if it matches these websites, spike it.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:43.440]  Right.
[00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:44.481]  Exactly.
[00:28:44.982 --> 00:28:52.771]  And so, you know, Facebook does have a political agenda, as we can see there, even with that poll that they took, should they stop a Trump campaign.
[00:28:53.191 --> 00:28:59.298]  But one of the things that they said that they, the curators, didn't ever suppress anything that had Facebook.
[00:28:59.659 --> 00:29:01.801]  If the news was about Facebook, they wouldn't.
[00:29:02.302 --> 00:29:03.083]  So they said that
[00:29:04.264 --> 00:29:08.047]  They were censoring content that was undermining Zuckerberg's immigration agenda.
[00:29:08.087 --> 00:29:09.568]  They said that was just an error.
[00:29:09.628 --> 00:29:11.069]  We didn't mean to suppress that.
[00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:12.390]  So what was happening?
[00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:18.293]  Obviously, he was very much behind immigration with the whole Muslim thing, the H-1B worker visas.
[00:29:18.714 --> 00:29:27.299]  And so a lot of people were trying to post stories and studies using government data, job reports showing how mass migration has impacted the U.S.
[00:29:27.339 --> 00:29:32.863]  labor market, things that were very contradictory and made the whole political agenda that he was pushing look bad.
[00:29:33.243 --> 00:29:34.064]  Those were suppressed.
[00:29:34.484 --> 00:29:35.965]  But it was an error, right?
[00:29:35.985 --> 00:29:49.734]  And so this is how you can see how it can sway an election or get a lot of young people or even people in the community thinking that, oh, well, all of my friends are really behind this topic because it's trending.
[00:29:49.794 --> 00:29:53.077]  So maybe I should also think like this and do that.
[00:29:53.117 --> 00:30:03.944]  Or maybe I shouldn't speak out about how I feel or what I'm really passionate about because it's not what's trending or it's not what all of my friends are into, you know, so it's they're completely controlling the narrative.
[00:30:04.224 --> 00:30:13.031]  Well, of course, in the past you used to have the three major networks, and they would determine the news, and they would basically, essentially all cover the same stories, give you the same angle on that.
[00:30:13.772 --> 00:30:20.117]  Now, as things begin to open up, we have to have a way for the establishment to take back the narrative.
[00:30:20.578 --> 00:30:26.683]  And of course, putting this out there and saying, oh, we're going to let all of you organically share the articles that you think are interesting,
[00:30:27.103 --> 00:30:31.504]  You can like these things and put them out there and you're just going to find out, you know, it's just going to bubble up to the top.
[00:30:31.544 --> 00:30:33.525]  Well, that has happened to some degree in the past.
[00:30:33.785 --> 00:30:35.705]  They're going to shut that down, take it over.
[00:30:35.965 --> 00:30:37.345]  That's going to be the facade.
[00:30:37.726 --> 00:30:48.208]  But they will, if they can confine everybody to Facebook and Google and a couple of other points of control, then they can control the narrative again, just like they did when they had just three networks giving everybody the news.
[00:30:48.288 --> 00:30:48.468]  Right.
[00:30:48.648 --> 00:30:50.270]  And that's what we have now.
[00:30:50.871 --> 00:30:55.997]  Regulators in Washington, of course, are really afraid of the new media, arguing that it's too powerful.
[00:30:56.317 --> 00:30:57.939]  So they want to put out these new regulations.
[00:30:57.959 --> 00:31:02.845]  But of course, Facebook doesn't fall under the new media because it's gotten in line with the globalist agenda.
[00:31:03.345 --> 00:31:08.651]  But they see that these dissonant voices out there can speak out and have a lot of powerful influence.
[00:31:09.252 --> 00:31:26.519]  But it's really dangerous because people don't understand how much the conservative viewpoint, even though the majority of Americans are conservative, it's so suppressed that they start to believe that this is actually how the world is thinking and it's not reality.
[00:31:26.839 --> 00:31:28.420]  So you see all these kids in school
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:32.482]  Who are trying to silence any conservative speakers from coming in.
[00:31:32.542 --> 00:31:38.525]  It's like, I think, 6 to 1 as far as liberal people who will come speak at your school versus conservatives.
[00:31:38.605 --> 00:31:50.532]  And now it's getting to the point where campus protesters are barring the door and setting off the fire alarm and doing everything they can to stop any conservative voices from even going on their campus.
[00:31:51.052 --> 00:31:54.294]  Because I would say that Zuckerberg is not even conservative, he's globalist.
[00:31:54.754 --> 00:31:55.555]  He's made it very clear.
[00:31:55.575 --> 00:31:59.177]  He's drawn very clearly the lines between globalism and nationalism.
[00:31:59.217 --> 00:32:03.479]  Between the multinational corporations first or America first.
[00:32:03.879 --> 00:32:12.845]  And what he does is, the way he fights that war, is to label everything that he's opposed to as racist or anti-woman or whatever.
[00:32:12.865 --> 00:32:15.586]  They've got all their little pigeon holes that they put everybody into.
[00:32:15.626 --> 00:32:19.528]  They essentially amount to ad hominem attacks on individuals or on groups.
[00:32:20.749 --> 00:32:31.554]  Well, it definitely seems to be finally backfiring because the curtain has been peeled back and people can see that they're using racism or whatever as this tool to silence and oppress people.
[00:32:31.935 --> 00:32:41.880]  And it's, you know... Well, we're going to take a break, a real quick break, and then we're going to be back with Darren McBreen and Joe Biggs, and they're going to show us what this looks like physically in the world.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:47.682]  They went to a Trump rally this weekend in Oregon, and they're going to show us and tell us what they saw there.
[00:32:47.702 --> 00:32:48.563]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:33:02.335 --> 00:33:11.519]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important area of InfoWars that runs the whole operation that is having such a big effect against the globalists.
[00:33:12.359 --> 00:33:19.983]  And I've said it over and over again, it is you the listeners and the viewers that send us the intel, the news tips, that support the broadcast, that spread the word.
[00:33:20.883 --> 00:33:23.984]  You are 90% of the operation or more.
[00:33:24.024 --> 00:33:27.166]  You don't stand beside us, you stand at the heart of InfoWars.
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:14.144 --> 00:37:17.207]  Hillary Clinton's days are numbered, or so it would appear.
[00:37:17.507 --> 00:37:28.777]  During the past few weeks, the FBI has dragged in Hillary's assistant, Huma Abedin, and Brian Pagliano, the IT specialist believed to have set up and maintained Clinton's server.
[00:37:28.957 --> 00:37:33.441]  Pagliano was given full immunity in exchange for his help with the investigation.
[00:37:33.641 --> 00:37:47.447]  An investigation narrowing down the correct answers to questions surrounding the emails on Hillary's private server deemed confidential that placed national security at a high level of risk while Hillary made a mockery of the U.S.
[00:37:47.487 --> 00:37:48.988]  Secretary of State office.
[00:37:49.568 --> 00:37:56.111]  By the way, you may have seen that I recently launched a Snapchat account.
[00:38:00.013 --> 00:38:00.553]  I love it.
[00:38:01.154 --> 00:38:01.634]  I love it.
[00:38:02.864 --> 00:38:06.036]  Those messages disappear all by themselves.
[00:38:08.937 --> 00:38:22.600]  As the investigation appears to wind down, Hillary will be interviewed by the FBI in a matter of days or weeks regarding the answers the FBI now has to questions that must be corroborated by Hillary.
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:33.062]  The FBI and the Justice Department have denied any knowledge of whether or not the investigation is closing or whether or not Hillary is the target of the investigation, but The Hill reports
[00:38:33.462 --> 00:38:43.089]  Steven Levin, a former federal prosecutor and current partner at the law firm Levin and Kurlitz said, This certainly sends the signal that they are nearing an end to their investigation.
[00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:50.555]  Typically, the way we structure the investigations when I was a federal prosecutor is that we would seek to interview the target last.
[00:38:50.895 --> 00:38:59.402]  Steven Levin continues, As you begin to interview people who are extremely close to the target of an investigation, people who are considered confidants,
[00:38:59.642 --> 00:39:04.505]  You typically interview those people towards the final stages of the investigation.
[00:39:04.745 --> 00:39:12.631]  So that way, if they tell you something that is contrary to something you've already learned, you can immediately challenge them on that information.
[00:39:13.131 --> 00:39:18.855]  Tech activist Marcel Lazar, aka Guccifer, claims to have breached Hillary's server at least twice.
[00:39:19.235 --> 00:39:29.384]  Guccifer said he first compromised Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal's AOL account in March of 2013 and used that as a stepping stone to the Clinton server.
[00:39:29.584 --> 00:39:37.351]  He said he accessed Clinton's server like twice, though he described the contents as not interesting to him at the time.
[00:39:37.711 --> 00:39:43.056]  Doodles by Bill Clinton appear to back up Guccifer's claims that were released as far back as 2013.
[00:39:44.497 --> 00:39:54.508]  It bears repeating the extent to which Hillary violated her position in the State Department, because most people have become completely accustomed to corruption as business as usual.
[00:39:54.729 --> 00:39:55.690]  Here are the facts.
[00:39:59.394 --> 00:40:13.840]  Clinton was responsible for ascertaining whether information in her possession was classified and acknowledged that negligent handling of that information could jeopardize national security, according to a copy of an agreement she signed upon taking the job.
[00:40:14.101 --> 00:40:27.947]  A day after assuming office as Secretary of State, Clinton signed a sensitive compartmented information non-disclosure agreement that laid out criminal penalties for any unauthorized disclosure of classified information.
[00:40:28.447 --> 00:40:40.817]  The Sensitive Compartmented Information Nondisclosure Agreement details how Hillary has been granted access to Sensitive Compartmented Information, or SCI, classified information.
[00:40:41.017 --> 00:40:46.361]  The agreement states that Hillary hereby acknowledges that the disclosure of SCI may constitute
[00:40:46.741 --> 00:40:56.526]  Violations of United States criminal laws and that nothing in the agreement constitutes a waiver by the United States of the right to prosecute for any statutory violation.
[00:40:56.766 --> 00:41:05.810]  The agreement is also severable, meaning if one part is unenforceable the remainder of the provisions in the agreement remain in full force and effect.
[00:41:06.111 --> 00:41:06.791]  Bottom line?
[00:41:07.071 --> 00:41:07.311]  U.S.
[00:41:07.351 --> 00:41:18.618]  intelligence officials determined at least four and up to 305 of the emails Hillary's aides printed out were from Hillary's personal server and were SCI at the time they were written.
[00:41:18.998 --> 00:41:24.021]  Two of the emails discussed classified drone information deemed top secret by the CIA.
[00:41:24.381 --> 00:41:29.446]  Hillary Clinton faces 10 years behind bars as required under the Espionage Act.
[00:41:29.786 --> 00:41:38.234]  Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA leak, was sentenced to three and a half years after disclosing national defense information concerning a covert operation.
[00:41:38.854 --> 00:41:44.579]  And General David Petraeus was slapped with two years probation and a fine of $100,000 for revealing classified documents to his mistress.
[00:41:47.802 --> 00:41:56.187]  Petraeus, a former director of the CIA, a four-star general, and CENTCOM commander, had served our country for 37 years.
[00:41:56.668 --> 00:41:59.350]  So why would Hillary Clinton deserve immunity?
[00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:05.994]  Ignorance and or negligence of Hillary's possession of highly sensitive classified emails is no joke.
[00:42:06.454 --> 00:42:23.642]  In fact, if Hillary does walk away from this investigation with a slap on the wrist after she personally went to great lengths to cover up a mountain of evidence, the entire farce will demonstrate just how far gone the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department really are.
[00:42:24.023 --> 00:42:32.407]  Hillary's path of deception could even serve to take those departments to the cleaners if Donald Trump becomes President and keeps his word.
[00:42:32.787 --> 00:42:34.768]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:42:43.914 --> 00:42:47.636]  Joining me now are Darren McBreen and Joe Biggs, our InfoWars reporters.
[00:42:47.676 --> 00:43:00.004]  They went to Eugene, Oregon this weekend to cover the massive Trump rally, and we've got a video compilation coming up in the next segment, but I wanted them to give us their first-hand impressions of what they saw there.
[00:43:00.344 --> 00:43:00.545]  Darren?
[00:43:01.721 --> 00:43:08.767]  Well, my biggest impression was what you're going to see is the bad part of Eugene, Oregon, and that's all the anti-Trump agitators.
[00:43:08.867 --> 00:43:17.214]  But keep in mind, inside there was, what, 5,000 capacity crowds, so there was 5,000 pro-Trump people in there.
[00:43:17.834 --> 00:43:19.975]  Very good Americans, very patriotic.
[00:43:20.335 --> 00:43:21.616]  People of all color, by the way.
[00:43:21.676 --> 00:43:24.377]  We saw a Muslim Trump supporter.
[00:43:24.957 --> 00:43:27.479]  We saw some black gentlemen, Latinos.
[00:43:28.119 --> 00:43:30.360]  But, you know, the crowd, you know, kids.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.321]  It was a really good family gathering.
[00:43:32.681 --> 00:43:33.481]  Full capacity, 5,000.
[00:43:33.882 --> 00:43:35.542]  They had to turn people away.
[00:43:35.923 --> 00:43:44.887]  Meanwhile, on the outside were the agitators and they surrounded most of the exits and blocked the pro-Trump supporters inside and wouldn't let them out.
[00:43:45.447 --> 00:43:46.328]  And about how many of them?
[00:44:01.581 --> 00:44:02.042]  I don't know.
[00:44:19.484 --> 00:44:23.205]  He's going to lose, and the Bernie Sanders supporters need to behave themselves.
[00:44:23.225 --> 00:44:24.125]  Now why would he say that?
[00:44:24.425 --> 00:44:26.646]  He knows it's not the Trump people's fault, right?
[00:44:27.026 --> 00:44:28.887]  He knows because he's seen all these things.
[00:44:29.167 --> 00:44:32.168]  It's a common... Everybody knows that this has happened.
[00:44:32.208 --> 00:44:45.111]  It's happened at all these different rallies, and it's only when they want to use it to political advantage, when the Democrats want to use it against Trump and his supporters, or when somebody like Ted Cruz wants to blame Trump and his supporters for the violence, they know which side the violence is coming from.
[00:44:45.131 --> 00:45:11.505]  Something I never thought would come out of Rachel Maddow's mouth was the truth, and she goes, these crazed Bernie supporters are going to Hillary Clinton events and attacking the Clinton supporters, but they still don't ever mention the fact that the thousands that show up to these Trump protests and incite violence and become violent, and then when they push someone to the limit, are shocked when they get pushed or punched, and then they want to play the victim when they're the ones coming out there and making that happen.
[00:45:12.145 --> 00:45:19.413]  And that's the thing right there, is there's these anti-Trump agitators, I don't like calling them protesters, because they're really rioters and agitators.
[00:45:20.114 --> 00:45:23.117]  If you look around, there's all kinds of flags.
[00:45:23.337 --> 00:45:23.958]  Not one American?
[00:45:23.998 --> 00:45:25.059]  Not one American flag.
[00:45:25.139 --> 00:45:32.708]  But you'll see La Raza, you'll see Mecca, you'll see, you know, the Mexican flags, every flag you can think of, communist flags, you know.
[00:45:33.929 --> 00:45:39.433]  I was just going to say, sorry, they're so stupid that they don't even realize they're paving the way for a Trump presidency.
[00:45:39.473 --> 00:45:39.873]  That's right.
[00:45:39.914 --> 00:45:43.496]  Because people are seeing this and it's... It's like Vincente Fox.
[00:45:43.516 --> 00:45:47.059]  He goes in as a powwow with Nancy Pelosi on how they can stop Trump.
[00:45:47.299 --> 00:45:50.621]  Or you got all these other leaders from other countries saying, we've got to stop Trump.
[00:45:50.661 --> 00:45:52.222]  And it's like, how do they think that's playing?
[00:45:52.243 --> 00:45:57.346]  I mean, I was surprised by the amount of pro-La Raza protesters or whatever it was.
[00:45:57.406 --> 00:45:58.387]  In Eugene, Oregon!
[00:45:59.168 --> 00:46:08.356]  There was at least 400 of these guys sitting there chanting, Viva La Raza, La Raza, let's put an end to white supremacy, stop white hate.
[00:46:08.837 --> 00:46:11.659]  And meanwhile, you know, they've got their Mexican flags.
[00:46:11.699 --> 00:46:13.821]  There's nothing about America whatsoever in it.
[00:46:14.181 --> 00:46:17.364]  And they're saying that they want a part of their, you know, their freedom.
[00:46:17.404 --> 00:46:18.646]  They want to be able to do this and that.
[00:46:18.906 --> 00:46:21.989]  Not once, though, did I ever see an American flag except
[00:46:22.549 --> 00:46:26.530]  On a Hispanic guy, he had an American flag draped around his neck, you saw him, right?
[00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:31.611]  And they all jumped around him, you're a traitor to your race, you're garbage, blah blah blah.
[00:46:31.671 --> 00:46:33.492]  Well, they don't want to be a part of America.
[00:46:33.792 --> 00:46:41.714]  They don't want to make America great, like that sign that little kid was holding, that drudge had at the top a couple of weeks ago, make America Mexican again.
[00:46:41.814 --> 00:46:44.955]  We saw a lot of those too, a lot of those signs were there as well.
[00:46:46.115 --> 00:46:47.518]  So stick around for the video, folks.
[00:46:47.578 --> 00:46:49.061]  It's coming up right after this break.
[00:46:49.081 --> 00:46:50.043]  You don't want to miss it.
[00:46:50.104 --> 00:46:54.713]  We're getting some heated arguments and tensions are running high right after this.
[00:46:54.894 --> 00:46:55.355]  Stick around.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:07.462]  Get Brain Force at 25% off for a limited time at Infowarslife.com.
[00:47:07.602 --> 00:47:09.783]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.903 --> 00:47:16.706]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:16.946 --> 00:47:20.207]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.408]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.990]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.

[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.

[00:48:58.968 --> 00:49:01.009]  InfoWars.com, here we are outside the Trump rally.
[00:49:11.704 --> 00:49:12.405]  Eugene, Oregon.
[00:49:20.351 --> 00:49:21.932]  Lots of protesters have arrived.
[00:49:25.635 --> 00:49:29.578]  And Donald Trump should be speaking inside any moment now.
[00:49:30.379 --> 00:49:39.967]  I'm telling you, the real fireworks will begin once that Trump rally is over and the Trump supporters are let out and they have to face this angry mob.
[00:49:42.824 --> 00:49:56.838]  It's interesting to walk behind some of the people that are wearing Trump t-shirts or Trump hats and see how they're treated by the protesters.
[00:49:57.939 --> 00:50:00.081]  This guy right here, for example, he's got a Trump shirt.
[00:50:13.045 --> 00:50:21.469]  It's one little punk just threw a bunch of confetti at a guy with a Trump shirt.
[00:50:21.489 --> 00:50:22.430]  Yeah, there's another.
[00:50:35.956 --> 00:50:38.337]  So you think it's appropriate that he throws stuff at people?
[00:50:39.357 --> 00:50:42.479]  I don't know what his reason was.
[00:50:43.859 --> 00:50:45.340]  I'll just say he's frustrated about something.
[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:47.121]  This guy's having a good time.
[00:50:48.421 --> 00:50:51.882]  It looks like Trump's not feeling so well.
[00:50:53.663 --> 00:50:54.483]  You can't watch it, right?
[00:50:54.784 --> 00:50:57.965]  You can't swim, huh?
[00:50:57.985 --> 00:51:05.068]  Okay, so I think he's making comments of this because this is a Mexican guy with the American flag
[00:51:06.647 --> 00:51:13.696]  And he's a pro-Trump supporter, so he's getting some angry looks from anti-Trump agitators.
[00:51:21.032 --> 00:51:22.433]  We were just inside right now.
[00:51:22.473 --> 00:51:23.173]  We got kicked out.
[00:51:23.213 --> 00:51:24.614]  Everybody was being violent towards us.
[00:51:24.734 --> 00:51:25.434]  Down with Trump.
[00:51:25.494 --> 00:51:26.595]  Down with Trump, bro.
[00:51:26.735 --> 00:51:27.815]  Just for saying, down with Trump.
[00:51:27.915 --> 00:51:28.996]  So you said, down with Trump.
[00:51:29.036 --> 00:51:29.576]  They kicked you out?
[00:51:29.636 --> 00:51:30.396]  Down with Trump.
[00:51:30.536 --> 00:51:30.996]  Everybody.
[00:51:31.157 --> 00:51:32.157]  Everybody went towards us.
[00:51:32.197 --> 00:51:32.937]  They were like, get out.
[00:51:33.217 --> 00:51:33.918]  Knock it off our heads.
[00:51:34.058 --> 00:51:34.958]  All right.
[00:51:34.978 --> 00:51:35.798]  All right.
[00:51:35.839 --> 00:51:36.699]  You heard it here, folks.
[00:51:37.839 --> 00:51:43.522]  They shouted, down with Trump, at a private event.
[00:51:44.653 --> 00:51:46.293]  They were kicked out of a private event.
[00:51:46.874 --> 00:51:47.574]  Hey, nice shirts.
[00:51:47.714 --> 00:51:48.654]  Look at that right there.
[00:51:48.714 --> 00:51:49.154]  Look at that.
[00:51:49.174 --> 00:51:56.616]  Hey guys, what's the flag represent?
[00:51:57.276 --> 00:52:00.997]  It's anarcho-syndicalism slash communism.
[00:52:02.117 --> 00:52:03.638]  Okay, are you guys Bernie supporters?
[00:52:04.198 --> 00:52:04.578]  I'm not.
[00:52:06.325 --> 00:52:07.646]  But you don't like Donald Trump?
[00:52:08.427 --> 00:52:09.148]  Yeah, no.
[00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:12.211]  What's your main deal?
[00:52:12.251 --> 00:52:14.573]  What's the main thing you don't like about the Don?
[00:52:15.274 --> 00:52:16.195]  About the Donald Trump?
[00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:23.193]  That's a tough question, but mainly because I guess he's just an asshole.
[00:52:23.233 --> 00:52:24.794]  Hey, put this on the front page of InfoWars.
[00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:26.996]  I'd like to say a shout-out to all my friends.
[00:52:28.217 --> 00:52:32.001]  First off, Alex Jones, I think you're a f***ing traitor to the liberty movement.
[00:52:32.281 --> 00:52:33.162]  Gay frogs!
[00:52:33.282 --> 00:52:34.203]  Gay frogs!
[00:52:34.323 --> 00:52:35.204]  Gay frogs!
[00:52:35.224 --> 00:52:36.044]  Gay frogs!
[00:52:36.184 --> 00:52:37.866]  We have a gay frog supporter over here.
[00:52:37.886 --> 00:52:38.947]  I support gay frogs.
[00:52:39.527 --> 00:52:39.928]  Why am I racist?
[00:52:39.988 --> 00:52:41.029]  You're like Trump.
[00:52:41.049 --> 00:52:41.429]  That's why.
[00:52:41.609 --> 00:52:41.970]  Donald Trump.
[00:52:46.193 --> 00:52:49.816]  Why is this young man racist for wearing a Donald Trump shirt?
[00:52:50.517 --> 00:52:55.621]  Because Trump is a racist, xenophobic, Islamic-hating, Mexican-hating... Wow, I've never heard that before.
[00:52:55.641 --> 00:52:56.982]  Okay, so... Wait, did you hear that?
[00:52:57.022 --> 00:52:58.443]  Did you hear that, like, off the internet?
[00:52:58.463 --> 00:52:59.564]  That's what he says.
[00:52:59.925 --> 00:53:01.886]  Yeah, he says that stuff.
[00:53:02.147 --> 00:53:03.147]  What did he say?
[00:53:04.769 --> 00:53:05.529]  Yeah, it's not.
[00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:08.092]  It's a shirt, and I'm allowed to wear it.
[00:53:08.352 --> 00:53:11.775]  Yeah, but it means he supports someone that's a terrible human being.
[00:53:12.215 --> 00:53:13.316]  And why do you say that?
[00:53:13.564 --> 00:53:16.787]  Because Trump is a terrible human being and that's in the discussion.
[00:53:18.208 --> 00:53:25.235]  Do you see Trump supporters going to like Bernie Sanders rallies and harassing Bernie Sanders voters?
[00:53:26.181 --> 00:53:30.163]  You know, if they're wimps and they're scared and they have no balls, that's not our problem.
[00:53:30.263 --> 00:53:31.363]  He's not worth your time.
[00:53:31.403 --> 00:53:32.664]  Don't talk to this man.
[00:53:32.804 --> 00:53:34.144]  He's not worth your time.
[00:53:34.204 --> 00:53:37.126]  He is not worth your time.
[00:53:37.206 --> 00:53:38.706]  No, no, no.
[00:53:38.866 --> 00:53:39.487]  He's an idiot.
[00:53:39.527 --> 00:53:40.147]  Let's agree.
[00:53:41.268 --> 00:53:41.928]  I'm an idiot.
[00:53:42.368 --> 00:53:43.188]  Why am I an idiot?
[00:53:44.269 --> 00:53:45.669]  Pour out in the water supply, boy.
[00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:46.770]  Why am I an idiot?
[00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:48.371]  F**k that n***** Trump!
[00:53:48.831 --> 00:53:51.052]  Alright.
[00:53:51.832 --> 00:53:53.033]  Hey, it's a gang s**t!
[00:53:53.313 --> 00:53:53.833]  Gang s**t!
[00:54:01.008 --> 00:54:06.031]  Obviously this behavior is only paving the way for a Donald Trump presidency.
[00:54:09.493 --> 00:54:11.634]  These guys are too stupid to know it.
[00:54:28.189 --> 00:54:32.872]  Hey, you think he can get beat up for wearing that around here?
[00:54:32.972 --> 00:54:35.534]  Oh, hell yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:35.674 --> 00:54:36.895]  Just for wearing a shirt though?
[00:54:37.095 --> 00:54:37.836]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:55:10.706 --> 00:55:12.487]  You all hate women.
[00:55:12.507 --> 00:55:14.648]  You're afraid of Mexican people.
[00:55:14.668 --> 00:55:18.270]  You're afraid of anybody other than the white man.
[00:55:18.310 --> 00:55:19.311]  You're just fearful.
[00:55:19.331 --> 00:55:20.412]  You're afraid of things.
[00:55:20.952 --> 00:55:23.153]  You're making a pretty big judgment point.
[00:55:23.173 --> 00:55:24.194]  You don't know anybody here.
[00:55:24.214 --> 00:55:26.095]  I know what you're voting for.
[00:55:26.295 --> 00:55:33.519]  You're voting for someone who supports homophobia, anti-Mexicanism, anti-Hispanic, has to be a bigot.
[00:55:33.559 --> 00:55:36.421]  We're just asking for honesty.
[00:55:39.011 --> 00:55:47.274]  Police have announced that they are getting ready to let the people who have attended Trump's rally, they're going to let them out of the parking lot.
[00:55:47.974 --> 00:55:54.916]  And the anti-Trump protesters have gathered here, I guess to harass them when they come out.
[00:55:54.936 --> 00:55:56.817]  No justice, no peace!
[00:55:57.057 --> 00:55:58.397]  No justice, no peace!
[00:55:58.597 --> 00:55:59.978]  No justice, no peace!
[00:56:00.178 --> 00:56:01.538]  No justice, no peace!
[00:56:01.718 --> 00:56:03.279]  No justice, no peace!
[00:56:03.319 --> 00:56:04.920]  No justice, no peace!
[00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:06.100]  No justice, no peace!
[00:56:07.114 --> 00:56:09.135]  We've got a significant development right here.
[00:56:09.255 --> 00:56:12.117]  Once again, this is InfoWars.
[00:56:12.157 --> 00:56:16.460]  Derrick McBrain outside the Trump rally in Eugene, Oregon.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:25.144]  The police have just told pedestrians to clear the area so the Trump supporters attending the Trump rally could leave.
[00:56:26.205 --> 00:56:28.907]  But now we have protesters that have blocked the gate.
[00:56:30.027 --> 00:56:30.948]  They have blocked the gate.
[00:56:32.694 --> 00:56:34.735]  And I guess they're trapping him inside.
[00:56:34.755 --> 00:56:36.796]  Let me back up.
[00:56:36.956 --> 00:56:38.216]  No, there's four exits, don't worry.
[00:56:38.296 --> 00:56:40.477]  Let me back up.
[00:56:41.097 --> 00:56:43.338]  Good.
[00:56:44.519 --> 00:56:49.020]  There is four exits, however, so... I guess they'll have to find another way to get out.
[00:56:50.401 --> 00:56:56.103]  And this is probably a blessing in disguise, because if they had to drive through this area, more than likely they would...
[00:56:57.671 --> 00:57:03.055]  Spit on, had their cars keyed, egged, you know, we've seen it before in Costa Mesa.
[00:57:03.936 --> 00:57:15.905]  And you're watching InfoWars coverage of the anti-Trump protest outside the Trump rally in Eugene, Oregon.
[00:57:15.925 --> 00:57:16.966]  They have blocked the gate.
[00:57:19.608 --> 00:57:20.308]  Come through guys.
[00:57:24.451 --> 00:57:26.193]  Police are saying clear the roadway.
[00:57:29.588 --> 00:57:34.031]  I'm just saying, you're recording something and you're lying to people.
[00:57:34.051 --> 00:57:35.852]  You're saying they're blocking the exit.
[00:57:35.872 --> 00:57:36.652]  There's four exits.
[00:58:01.195 --> 00:58:02.256]  That's it for tonight's news.
