[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:02.070]  We're good to go.
[00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:31.846]  That can stop this corrupt machine is you.
[00:00:33.726 --> 00:00:37.487]  The only force strong enough to save our country is us.
[00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:44.888]  The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American people.
[00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:51.130]  I'm doing this for the people and for the movement.
[00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.711]  And we will take back this country for you, and we will make America great again.
[00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:04.111]  I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message.
[00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:26.749]  My fellow Americans, my fellow humans on planet Earth, there is an epic, legendary awakening of nationalism and populism happening from the Brexit to the Donald Trump phenomenon to Russia pulling out of the New World Order and arresting the bankster oligarchs.
[00:01:27.449 --> 00:01:29.851]  Humanity's will for self-determination
[00:01:30.752 --> 00:01:32.593]  And freedom is expressing itself.
[00:01:33.073 --> 00:01:40.477]  The great classical liberalisms of Thomas Jefferson and Francis Bacon are reawakening right now.
[00:01:41.257 --> 00:01:50.442]  And it's because of the historical times we live in that InfoWars is going to embark on an unprecedented 52-hour broadcast.
[00:01:50.482 --> 00:01:55.984]  We've done 24-hour broadcasts before, but we've never gone 52 hours.
[00:01:56.544 --> 00:01:57.305]  This Monday,
[00:01:57.825 --> 00:01:59.246]  From 11 a.m.
[00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:04.988]  Central right through Tuesday right into Wednesday when the Wednesday show ends at 3 p.m.
[00:02:05.028 --> 00:02:12.872]  Central we will broadcast for an unprecedented legendary over-the-top 52 hours live.
[00:02:12.892 --> 00:02:15.813]  The second great awakening is taking place.
[00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.475]  We are in the dawn of a new
[00:02:19.495 --> 00:02:24.039]  ...era of renaissance, of rediscovery, and human liberty.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:37.731]  Donald Trump, the Brexit, Infowars, Matt Drudge, Breitbart, WorldNetDaily, and so many others are only one small manifestation in the fire of liberty that is now exploding across the globe.
[00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:39.952]  You can see it in the news.
[00:02:40.012 --> 00:02:40.893]  You can feel it.
[00:02:41.373 --> 00:02:42.594]  You can witness it on the street.
[00:02:43.254 --> 00:02:44.115]  History's happening.
[00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:48.637]  They always say this election is the most important in our lifetimes and we laugh it off.
[00:02:48.717 --> 00:02:52.199]  I wouldn't even get involved in past elections because they were so clearly frauds.
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.041]  This one's the big kahuna.
[00:02:54.901 --> 00:03:03.264]  A clear demarcation line, a crossroads between nationalism and tyranny, between Americanism and globalism.
[00:03:03.924 --> 00:03:08.045]  That's why we're doing this one time and one time only, because history's happening.
[00:03:08.505 --> 00:03:16.628]  A 52-hour live transmission kicking off Monday, November 7th, 2016 at 11 a.m., running right through Election Day the 8th,
[00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:21.750]  End of the night at 3 p.m.
[00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.951]  and quite frankly beyond.
[00:03:23.312 --> 00:03:29.316]  It's historical and it's part of overthrowing the dinosaur media, not just overthrowing the two-party corrupt system.
[00:03:29.817 --> 00:03:35.521]  I want to see 10 million viewers tune in over the 50 plus hours and that's where you come in.
[00:03:35.961 --> 00:03:37.683]  You are the heart and blood of the InfoWar.
[00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:47.711]  If you spread the link to InfoWars.com forward slash show and point out that this is the alternative new media, this is the rebellion, this is the modern Paul Revere operation,
[00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:51.833]  Then all of you are riding right beside us, not behind us.
[00:03:52.194 --> 00:03:58.758]  So spread the word by Paul Revere's, no matter where you live in the world, to Information Warfare Arms.
[00:03:59.078 --> 00:04:02.240]  The globalists are coming and they will be met on the field.
[00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:05.342]  Infowars.com.
[00:04:05.703 --> 00:04:06.323]  Powered by 1776.
[00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:33.590]  I'm gonna be with you till 8 a.m.
[00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.431]  Central, 221 a.m.
[00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:36.191]  Central right now.
[00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:38.192]  We're pulling another all-nighter here, folks.
[00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:42.794]  What else would you do the night Donald J. Trump wins the presidency?
[00:04:42.814 --> 00:04:44.694]  All right, here's what the deal is, folks.
[00:04:45.715 --> 00:04:47.035]  I've got some stuff I'm gonna cover.
[00:04:48.116 --> 00:04:49.156]  We got a great crew back there.
[00:04:49.176 --> 00:04:50.377]  They're gonna be working with me tonight.
[00:04:51.017 --> 00:04:53.638]  Marcos, you're gonna be with me tonight, is that correct?
[00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:56.699]  All night.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.220]  That's my boy Marcos.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.041]  What about, is Ashley gonna be around tonight, too?
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.421]  Yeah, she's going to be taking your calls.
[00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:04.762]  She'll be the lady on the phone.
[00:05:05.143 --> 00:05:06.264]  So here's the deal, folks.
[00:05:06.284 --> 00:05:07.445]  We're going to open up the phone lines.
[00:05:07.465 --> 00:05:07.905]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:08.366]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[00:05:08.386 --> 00:05:08.446]  1-877-789-2539.
[00:05:08.466 --> 00:05:10.067]  Ashley will take your call.
[00:05:10.087 --> 00:05:11.628]  Here's the deal, folks.
[00:05:11.648 --> 00:05:14.311]  We've got literally thousands of people that try to call in.
[00:05:27.526 --> 00:05:39.413]  Basically what I'm telling you is I'm the kind of guy who feels bad when I try to, when I cut you off and I don't let you finish your point, but we've got too many people calling in, so if you call in, have your point ready.
[00:05:39.473 --> 00:05:42.895]  In fact, hey Ashley, what do you want to do?
[00:05:42.915 --> 00:05:44.536]  You want to do like a five minute limit?
[00:05:44.556 --> 00:05:46.037]  Like if they hit five minutes, they're off?
[00:05:49.295 --> 00:05:50.938]  Yeah, let's come on and make our point.
[00:05:51.078 --> 00:05:52.140]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.665]  But let's actually have a... This is not Ashley, by the way.
[00:05:54.805 --> 00:05:55.747]  Okay, that's Marcos.
[00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:56.729]  Ashley's back there too.
[00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:57.811]  Alright, so here's the deal, folks.
[00:05:57.931 --> 00:05:58.913]  Ashley's going to be in charge of the phone.
[00:05:59.514 --> 00:06:01.137]  Five minutes is the max.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.140]  I'm sorry.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.661]  I don't mean to cut you off.
[00:06:04.741 --> 00:06:05.762]  I don't want to cut you off.
[00:06:05.842 --> 00:06:07.022]  It's not because I'm a mean guy.
[00:06:07.423 --> 00:06:09.404]  We've literally got thousands of people that want to call in.
[00:06:09.824 --> 00:06:11.165]  So, call in.
[00:06:11.685 --> 00:06:12.825]  Have your point ready.
[00:06:13.526 --> 00:06:15.007]  Five minute max.
[00:06:15.707 --> 00:06:16.247]  That's it.
[00:06:16.407 --> 00:06:17.808]  You're done after five minutes.
[00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:19.989]  Again, this is not to be rude.
[00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:22.531]  This is not because I don't want to hear from you or whatever it is you're saying.
[00:06:22.931 --> 00:06:26.553]  We just need to take all these callers because we literally have thousands that want to call in.
[00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:27.433]  All right.
[00:06:29.591 --> 00:06:32.174]  Here's what I want everybody listening to do.
[00:06:32.694 --> 00:06:35.617]  I want you to get ready to capture this moment, okay?
[00:06:35.637 --> 00:06:45.807]  Because I want this to go out on Twitter to all of the people out there, the mainstream media, the hillbots, the brainwashed masses who thought Trump never had a chance.
[00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:48.270]  For whatever reason, he's racist, he's this.
[00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.132]  The polls, the polls, the polls!
[00:06:50.732 --> 00:06:52.454]  Wait a second, do we remember the polls?
[00:06:52.754 --> 00:06:53.755]  What about the polls?
[00:06:54.196 --> 00:06:56.218]  The polls, the polls, the polls, the polls!
[00:06:56.498 --> 00:07:00.422]  Fox polls, CNN polls, MSNBC polls, New York Times polls!
[00:07:00.762 --> 00:07:05.246]  All the polls had Trump losing, and now he's kicking ass!
[00:07:05.727 --> 00:07:07.068]  So, so much for your polls.
[00:07:07.448 --> 00:07:08.730]  So, capture this moment.
[00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.711]  This is it, folks.
[00:07:10.808 --> 00:07:13.791]  Nanny Nanny Boo Boo, we beat you!
[00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:16.614]  Nanny Nanny Boo Boo, you were wrong!
[00:07:16.694 --> 00:07:19.217]  Nanny Nanny Boo Boo, I was right!
[00:07:19.457 --> 00:07:22.580]  Nanny Nanny Boo Boo, my tinfoil hat still works!
[00:07:23.061 --> 00:07:23.421]  Ha!
[00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:24.062]  Ha!
[00:07:25.492 --> 00:07:27.334]  We were right again!
[00:07:27.974 --> 00:07:30.636]  Donald Trump won tonight in a landslide.
[00:07:30.696 --> 00:07:33.619]  Right now they're saying he's got 279 electoral votes.
[00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:36.201]  He's gonna finish with over 300, folks.
[00:07:36.702 --> 00:07:37.002]  Okay?
[00:07:37.242 --> 00:07:51.234]  So again, to all the haters, to everybody out there who thought we were crazy, to everybody who bought into the mainstream media polls, to everybody who bought into Trump being racist, Nanny Nanny Boo Boo, we beat you!
[00:07:51.434 --> 00:07:52.835]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:07:53.536 --> 00:08:00.697]  Sorry, I'm just really basking in this because... I mean, you've dealt with it too, folks.
[00:08:00.737 --> 00:08:02.838]  The people who tell you you're crazy.
[00:08:02.878 --> 00:08:03.958]  Trump never had a chance.
[00:08:03.998 --> 00:08:04.718]  Don't you remember?
[00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:06.479]  Don't you remember?
[00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:09.619]  Let's rewind the clocks back a year and a half.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.280]  Or I guess not quite a year and a half.
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.180]  Almost a year and a half.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.040]  A year and five months.
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.161]  Donald Trump announces his run for presidency.
[00:08:19.628 --> 00:08:21.349]  Starts gaining momentum within a month.
[00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.051]  He can't win!
[00:08:23.071 --> 00:08:25.092]  He can't win!
[00:08:25.132 --> 00:08:26.493]  They've got Rubio!
[00:08:26.553 --> 00:08:28.034]  They've got Cruz!
[00:08:28.434 --> 00:08:29.415]  It's Rubio!
[00:08:29.495 --> 00:08:30.336]  It's Cruz!
[00:08:30.436 --> 00:08:31.176]  It's Christie!
[00:08:31.457 --> 00:08:32.938]  It's Jeb Bush!
[00:08:33.938 --> 00:08:35.339]  Jeb Bush.
[00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:37.081]  Talk about an afterthought.
[00:08:39.182 --> 00:08:45.567]  I guarantee you, entering this election, the establishment plan was Bush v. Clinton, folks.
[00:08:46.607 --> 00:08:49.269]  A total control of the election.
[00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:55.355]  Bush vs. Clinton in what would have been the most ironic election ever.
[00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:57.217]  Bush vs. Clinton when they're both on the same team.
[00:08:57.497 --> 00:08:58.137]  So that failed.
[00:08:58.177 --> 00:08:59.158]  Jeb Bush sucks.
[00:09:00.199 --> 00:09:01.240]  Low energy Jeb.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.621]  I forget what Donald called him.
[00:09:04.283 --> 00:09:04.883]  Little Jeb.
[00:09:04.943 --> 00:09:06.044]  Or no, that was Little Marco.
[00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:07.305]  Whatever, they're both little.
[00:09:07.326 --> 00:09:07.726]  They're gone.
[00:09:07.866 --> 00:09:08.366]  Aftermath.
[00:09:08.487 --> 00:09:08.947]  Afterthought.
[00:09:09.467 --> 00:09:09.748]  See ya.
[00:09:10.933 --> 00:09:11.713]  But don't you remember?
[00:09:12.094 --> 00:09:13.514]  Trump doesn't have a chance!
[00:09:13.855 --> 00:09:18.477]  And then a month out, two months out, the polls, the polls, the polls!
[00:09:18.557 --> 00:09:19.238]  Clinton winning!
[00:09:19.438 --> 00:09:20.078]  Clinton winning!
[00:09:20.258 --> 00:09:21.079]  Clinton winning by 10!
[00:09:21.619 --> 00:09:22.179]  Clinton winning by 15!
[00:09:22.259 --> 00:09:23.540]  Clinton winning by 5!
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:24.580]  Clinton winning by 10!
[00:09:24.881 --> 00:09:25.301]  Clinton winning!
[00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:25.681]  Clinton winning!
[00:09:25.841 --> 00:09:26.141]  Polls!
[00:09:26.181 --> 00:09:26.442]  Polls!
[00:09:26.502 --> 00:09:26.802]  Polls!
[00:09:27.422 --> 00:09:27.902]  Wrong!
[00:09:28.202 --> 00:09:28.623]  Wrong!
[00:09:28.903 --> 00:09:29.363]  Wrong!
[00:09:30.864 --> 00:09:35.006]  When are you going to start listening to people who actually do research?
[00:09:35.647 --> 00:09:37.968]  When are you going to start listening to the people who actually care about you?
[00:09:44.264 --> 00:09:46.625]  I don't know how much of my family is tuned in right now.
[00:09:46.705 --> 00:09:48.206]  First of all, I just want to say I love you all.
[00:09:49.046 --> 00:09:50.407]  I love you all, all my family.
[00:09:50.427 --> 00:09:53.429]  I love everybody that's tuned in, all my friends that have been very supportive over this.
[00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:58.012]  But I can't wait for Thanksgiving and Christmas.
[00:09:58.112 --> 00:09:59.853]  Boy, am I going to rub it in your face.
[00:10:01.978 --> 00:10:20.982]  You thought I was so crazy you looked at me Like I had three heads on my shoulder when I told you that Donald Trump was gonna win Can't wait to hear what you had to say now I'm crazy.
[00:10:21.622 --> 00:10:29.384]  I'm the tinfoil hat war where I was right again now Alex is very concerned about the aftermath of
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.001]  What they might do in response to this.
[00:10:34.362 --> 00:10:35.563]  It will be interesting to see.
[00:10:35.963 --> 00:10:36.924]  Will they back off?
[00:10:37.484 --> 00:10:38.705]  Will they try to start a war?
[00:10:40.966 --> 00:10:46.069]  I have the feeling that the whole Russian meddling in the election, Russian hacking, all that stuff.
[00:10:46.129 --> 00:10:47.650]  I have a feeling that's just going to fade away.
[00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.732]  That never really hit the ground.
[00:10:50.752 --> 00:10:52.393]  That never really caught any momentum.
[00:10:55.534 --> 00:10:58.276]  But there obviously will be a counter plan here.
[00:10:58.396 --> 00:10:59.677]  Obama has two months left.
[00:11:02.039 --> 00:11:02.799]  You know what, though?
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.621]  Think about this, folks.
[00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:09.883]  Bernie Sanders had a lot of people following him.
[00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:12.485]  We told you who Bernie Sanders really was.
[00:11:12.885 --> 00:11:19.069]  He turned out to be a total shill for Clinton, lost a lot of his supporters because he ended up endorsing Clinton.
[00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:26.673]  Okay, so now you've got Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee.
[00:11:28.764 --> 00:11:30.204]  And she cares about you, right?
[00:11:30.264 --> 00:11:31.205]  She cares about America.
[00:11:31.285 --> 00:11:33.465]  She's the candidate that cares about you.
[00:11:33.545 --> 00:11:34.966]  Donald Trump is cold-hearted.
[00:11:35.286 --> 00:11:36.626]  Alex Jones has a black heart, right?
[00:11:37.026 --> 00:11:38.207]  Why won't you vote for Hillary?
[00:11:38.247 --> 00:11:39.367]  She actually cares about you.
[00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:41.367]  She's the one that's been fighting for the children.
[00:11:41.628 --> 00:11:43.508]  She's the one that's been fighting for you.
[00:11:43.728 --> 00:11:44.968]  Oh my God, don't you remember?
[00:11:45.289 --> 00:11:46.869]  Stronger together, folks.
[00:11:47.189 --> 00:11:48.329]  Stronger together.
[00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.030]  We've been telling you this woman is a total hypocrite.
[00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:55.371]  What happens tonight when it turns out that she's losing in a landslide?
[00:11:55.651 --> 00:11:56.512]  What did she do, folks?
[00:11:56.952 --> 00:11:57.692]  She ran away.
[00:11:59.181 --> 00:11:59.661]  She hid.
[00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:01.643]  Still haven't seen her!
[00:12:02.123 --> 00:12:03.184]  Have you seen Hillary Clinton?
[00:12:03.744 --> 00:12:04.024]  No.
[00:12:05.245 --> 00:12:06.186]  Total coward.
[00:12:06.566 --> 00:12:07.407]  Total fraud.
[00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:09.968]  And in the final, you know what?
[00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:12.090]  The final move.
[00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:22.837]  This, again, this shows you Bernie Sanders supporters got burned by Bernie Sanders and now Hillary Clinton supporters, after getting burned by the mainstream media, have now been burned by Hillary Clinton.
[00:12:22.857 --> 00:12:23.377]  You know why?
[00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:25.559]  Because she abandoned you.
[00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:28.994]  She totally abandoned you.
[00:12:29.295 --> 00:12:31.838]  Stronger together, and then she left.
[00:12:32.619 --> 00:12:33.380]  She was gone.
[00:12:35.023 --> 00:12:35.643]  Don't you get it?
[00:12:36.721 --> 00:12:37.982]  This is how these people operate.
[00:12:38.042 --> 00:12:44.448]  Bernie Sanders sells you a bill of goods, shills for Hillary Clinton, and then gives you the middle finger and endorses Hillary Clinton.
[00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:53.677]  Hillary Clinton says she's for you, she's the candidate for the people, she's the candidate for the children, she cares about America, Donald Trump's cold-hearted, and then after she loses, what does she do?
[00:12:53.957 --> 00:12:56.840]  She gives you the middle finger and runs and hides.
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.042]  And we still haven't seen her.
[00:13:07.992 --> 00:13:13.637]  I wonder, are the Hillary Clinton supporters going to admit they were conned?
[00:13:14.457 --> 00:13:17.119]  Are the Hillary Clinton supporters going to admit they were duped?
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.461]  This is actually a great point.
[00:13:19.381 --> 00:13:19.922]  Think about this.
[00:13:21.563 --> 00:13:22.704]  Female-aged Skrillex.
[00:13:23.445 --> 00:13:24.546]  We played her last night.
[00:13:24.586 --> 00:13:27.208]  You've probably seen the video on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:13:27.268 --> 00:13:28.048]  Female-aged Skrillex.
[00:13:28.609 --> 00:13:29.710]  Do you think... Look at that.
[00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:30.590]  They got it ready to go.
[00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:31.211]  Of course you do.
[00:13:31.651 --> 00:13:32.812]  Of course you have it ready to go.
[00:13:33.072 --> 00:13:34.233]  Marcos Morales, folks.
[00:13:34.253 --> 00:13:34.614]  What a guy.
[00:13:35.819 --> 00:13:38.981]  So, will she admit that she was tricked?
[00:13:39.761 --> 00:13:41.742]  Will she admit that she was duped?
[00:13:42.863 --> 00:13:51.648]  Or will these brainwashed masses entrench themselves even deeper into the establishment narrative and say that
[00:13:52.776 --> 00:13:57.980]  You know, oh, Donald Trump somehow stole it, Donald Trump conned America, the whole thing was rigged.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:04.565]  It'll be really interesting to see the response of the Hillary Clinton supporters, like female-age Skrillex.
[00:14:05.045 --> 00:14:07.267]  Now, we've already seen what the response is.
[00:14:07.307 --> 00:14:13.432]  There she is, female-age Skrillex with the veins popping, female Carl the Cuck.
[00:14:14.533 --> 00:14:16.975]  She told me that I was the detriment to America.
[00:14:18.869 --> 00:14:20.510]  I am America, you dumbass.
[00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:21.171]  Excuse me.
[00:14:21.271 --> 00:14:21.671]  You know what?
[00:14:21.691 --> 00:14:22.572]  These are fine ladies.
[00:14:22.812 --> 00:14:23.612]  They've been brainwashed.
[00:14:23.632 --> 00:14:24.193]  They're victims.
[00:14:24.613 --> 00:14:26.094]  I told her I wanted to be friends with her.
[00:14:26.114 --> 00:14:27.955]  I'm like, hey, we can be friends.
[00:14:27.995 --> 00:14:30.977]  Like, I'm just trying to tell you some facts you might want to know.
[00:14:31.397 --> 00:14:33.039]  And by the way, your candidate's going to lose.
[00:14:33.059 --> 00:14:33.699]  You've been duped.
[00:14:33.719 --> 00:14:34.580]  You've been brainwashed.
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.662]  And then she gives you the middle finger on election night.
[00:14:38.222 --> 00:14:38.762]  How about this?
[00:14:39.283 --> 00:14:39.823]  Let's recall.
[00:14:41.004 --> 00:14:43.405]  It was Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton
[00:14:44.523 --> 00:14:47.066]  Sitting here saying, Trump's a sore loser.
[00:14:47.146 --> 00:14:48.127]  Trump's a sore loser.
[00:14:49.048 --> 00:14:52.030]  I've never heard of someone complaining about the election being rigged.
[00:14:52.091 --> 00:14:53.372]  It can't possibly happen.
[00:14:53.412 --> 00:14:54.333]  Trump's a sore loser.
[00:14:54.373 --> 00:14:55.354]  He's already complaining.
[00:14:55.714 --> 00:14:56.455]  And then what happens?
[00:14:56.495 --> 00:14:59.538]  Trump wins, and then Hillary Clinton is the sore loser!
[00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:13.140]  So, we've reached an interesting paradigm, we've reached an interesting point in history where are the brainwashed sheeple going to admit they're brainwashed?
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.062]  Will they finally recognize it?
[00:15:15.102 --> 00:15:18.064]  Will they finally recognize the lies of the mainstream media?
[00:15:18.845 --> 00:15:20.246]  Will they admit they were duped?
[00:15:21.567 --> 00:15:27.372]  Or will they entrench themselves further into the Stockholm Syndrome, claim they're the victims,
[00:15:29.088 --> 00:15:32.630]  And I guess, I mean, I don't know where you really go from here.
[00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:39.874]  Because if you really think Trump is that bad as you think he is, a racist, misogynist, whatever, what do you do now?
[00:15:40.754 --> 00:15:41.375]  What do you do now?
[00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:50.319]  And I'll admit, you know, I was the kind of guy that thought once Donald Trump was elected, things would immediately start setting off.
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.941]  I'm not feeling that way anymore, folks.
[00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:55.510]  I'm really not feeling that way.
[00:15:55.710 --> 00:16:03.737]  And I think the fact that we haven't seen riots anywhere tonight is an indication that people are just over it.
[00:16:05.898 --> 00:16:12.304]  You know, the George Soros-funded protests have completely lost their steam.
[00:16:14.906 --> 00:16:19.589]  And they were losing steam for a long time, but they always had
[00:16:20.649 --> 00:16:24.871]  The end result that would justify their movement.
[00:16:25.871 --> 00:16:27.872]  But now that end result is gone.
[00:16:28.733 --> 00:16:29.913]  Trump is the end result.
[00:16:31.474 --> 00:16:34.816]  So... I guess we'll find out here in the coming days.
[00:16:35.376 --> 00:16:38.017]  Will the brainwashed sheeple admit they were brainwashed?
[00:16:39.258 --> 00:16:40.498]  Will they admit they were duped?
[00:16:40.618 --> 00:16:42.559]  Will they see what's actually going on?
[00:16:42.579 --> 00:16:44.320]  Will they finally put the glasses on?
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.961]  Will they finally see reality?
[00:16:45.981 --> 00:16:48.562]  Because... Because let's remember...
[00:16:49.724 --> 00:16:51.565]  In fact, I'll be perfectly honest with you folks.
[00:16:53.607 --> 00:16:56.208]  I'll tell you, I had a lot of money riding on this election.
[00:16:56.929 --> 00:17:00.391]  I gambled with a lot of friends that Trump would win.
[00:17:00.431 --> 00:17:04.153]  These are bets going back from a year ago, and I just won them all.
[00:17:05.134 --> 00:17:07.115]  And even last week,
[00:17:09.764 --> 00:17:14.447]  I remember all my friends who I bet with that Trump would win sending me the polls.
[00:17:14.687 --> 00:17:15.848]  You know, sending me the polls.
[00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:16.949]  They're tweeting me the polls.
[00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:17.969]  They're messaging me the polls.
[00:17:18.009 --> 00:17:19.670]  The polls, the polls, the polls, the polls.
[00:17:21.652 --> 00:17:23.333]  I told you the polls were rigged!
[00:17:23.353 --> 00:17:24.694]  I told you!
[00:17:26.155 --> 00:17:27.616]  Again, I'm not crazy.
[00:17:27.736 --> 00:17:29.137]  I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
[00:17:29.217 --> 00:17:30.738]  I don't wear a tinfoil hat.
[00:17:30.918 --> 00:17:32.199]  I live in reality.
[00:17:32.479 --> 00:17:33.880]  I've beaten the brainwashing.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.121]  I've broken through the propaganda.
[00:17:36.141 --> 00:17:36.221]  Okay?
[00:17:38.459 --> 00:17:41.461]  All I'm doing is trying to bring you on the team.
[00:17:41.842 --> 00:18:03.579]  I'll tell you, the most amazing thing about this to me is the patriots out there who are true Americans, but didn't really know what was going on, didn't really understand the globalists, didn't really understand propaganda, but they were true patriots, they loved the country, but they just didn't know all this was going on.
[00:18:04.419 --> 00:18:06.261]  And at the beginning of the cycle,
[00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:12.873]  You know, they kind of buy into the brainwashing social patterns because they're just not really engaged.
[00:18:12.893 --> 00:18:14.774]  They're patriots, but they're not really engaged.
[00:18:14.794 --> 00:18:17.075]  They got their own things going on, sports, work, whatever it is.
[00:18:17.095 --> 00:18:23.038]  And they didn't like Trump this entire election cycle.
[00:18:23.158 --> 00:18:26.619]  I have like 10 to 20 friends and family that are the same story.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.201]  The entire election cycle, they could never get behind Trump.
[00:18:31.081 --> 00:18:32.662]  They could never get behind Trump.
[00:18:33.242 --> 00:18:34.743]  And then for whatever reason,
[00:18:36.471 --> 00:18:41.095]  It really started Sunday and then it came on strong Monday and Tuesday.
[00:18:41.816 --> 00:18:43.197]  They came over for Trump.
[00:18:43.257 --> 00:18:44.518]  They were texting me for Trump.
[00:18:44.558 --> 00:18:46.720]  They said I voted for Trump today.
[00:18:49.162 --> 00:18:52.705]  And that might be what sent Trump over the edge.
[00:18:54.147 --> 00:18:56.489]  Now Trump is still winning the popular vote.
[00:19:00.188 --> 00:19:02.809]  So, you know, we'll see what happens.
[00:19:02.929 --> 00:19:06.210]  If Hillary Clinton ends up winning the popular vote, I don't think she will.
[00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.150]  Maybe that's what they do, though.
[00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:22.434]  They steal the popular vote in favor of Hillary, and then they try to spin that towards some sort of contestion or, I don't know, some sort of narrative or something like that.
[00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:24.134]  So that could be something to keep an eye on.
[00:19:25.875 --> 00:19:27.055]  But I'll tell you what, right now,
[00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:30.913]  Hey, can you pull my screen up here, Marcos?
[00:19:30.993 --> 00:19:31.573]  Is that available?
[00:19:33.755 --> 00:19:38.237]  Right now, folks, Marcos Morales is going to be in the office with us.
[00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:39.597]  Do we need to get the TriCaster?
[00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:40.118]  I know how to do it.
[00:19:40.258 --> 00:19:40.558]  I got it.
[00:19:41.118 --> 00:19:41.518]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:19:41.538 --> 00:19:41.878]  I got it.
[00:19:42.219 --> 00:19:42.919]  It should be started.
[00:19:42.959 --> 00:19:43.659]  It should be good to go.
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.301]  See if it's... Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:46.361 --> 00:19:47.561]  Nico came in here and set it up.
[00:19:48.722 --> 00:19:49.302]  Sorry, folks.
[00:19:49.542 --> 00:19:52.083]  I got to come in and troubleshoot some technical difficulties.
[00:19:52.744 --> 00:19:54.905]  We're going to make it so I can share my screen with you.
[00:19:56.491 --> 00:20:00.375]  But right now, the Electoral College... Yeah, Nico said it was running.
[00:20:00.915 --> 00:20:05.359]  The Electoral College... This computer's weird, dude.
[00:20:05.379 --> 00:20:07.501]  279 to 218 for Hillary Clinton.
[00:20:07.521 --> 00:20:09.803]  This is Marcos Morales' mug in front of me, by the way.
[00:20:10.646 --> 00:20:11.407]  He's a good looking guy.
[00:20:11.447 --> 00:20:12.728]  Hey, we're actually on that camera.
[00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:14.610]  Marcos Morales.
[00:20:15.271 --> 00:20:16.632]  Marcos Morales voted Trump.
[00:20:17.273 --> 00:20:18.394]  He's got a beautiful family.
[00:20:18.434 --> 00:20:19.455]  He wants them to have a future.
[00:20:20.156 --> 00:20:21.497]  He's helping me get my screen set up.
[00:20:21.517 --> 00:20:25.542]  But right now, Donald Trump is in the books with 279 electoral votes.
[00:20:25.582 --> 00:20:26.442]  I think he's going to finish with 305.
[00:20:28.243 --> 00:20:39.867]  One thing we're going to do tonight is we're going to compare, I'm going to, we're going to compare basically what happened in the last election to what happened in this election.
[00:20:39.887 --> 00:20:40.567]  Hey.
[00:20:45.569 --> 00:20:46.489]  This is Leanne McAdoo.
[00:20:46.509 --> 00:20:47.510]  I'm trying to get her to sit down.
[00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:50.591]  Your computer is working.
[00:20:51.071 --> 00:20:52.591]  So here's, yeah, we're going to take calls.
[00:20:52.631 --> 00:20:53.432]  I'm going to take your calls.
[00:20:53.472 --> 00:20:54.292]  I'm going to take your calls.
[00:20:54.892 --> 00:20:55.292]  You know me.
[00:20:55.312 --> 00:20:55.952]  I'm long-winded.
[00:20:56.192 --> 00:20:57.273]  I'm going to be here till 8 a.m.
[00:20:57.293 --> 00:20:57.513]  folks.
[00:21:00.154 --> 00:21:03.395]  So, here's the screen right now with what we have official.
[00:21:03.475 --> 00:21:05.256]  Donald Trump with 279.
[00:21:05.316 --> 00:21:06.636]  Hillary Clinton with 218.
[00:21:07.456 --> 00:21:10.718]  And then obviously, they're still tabulating these results.
[00:21:10.778 --> 00:21:11.898]  Here's the popular vote.
[00:21:12.578 --> 00:21:14.319]  We're going to continue to monitor this.
[00:21:14.519 --> 00:21:17.160]  Barack Obama won with 62 million last year.
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.260]  Trump with 57.
[00:21:20.141 --> 00:21:22.742]  I don't see how Donald Trump doesn't get more.
[00:21:24.202 --> 00:21:27.943]  Of course, I guess the actual... Here, you know what?
[00:21:27.983 --> 00:21:29.524]  I've got these numbers right here, actually.
[00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:35.323]  Romney had 59 million, Obama had 62 million.
[00:21:36.644 --> 00:21:39.785]  Here you can see how everything went last year.
[00:21:40.446 --> 00:21:41.726]  So what are the big differences?
[00:21:42.107 --> 00:21:49.851]  Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, all went for Trump.
[00:21:50.291 --> 00:21:52.232]  Oh, and Pennsylvania, of course, Pennsylvania.
[00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:57.906]  So that is what made the difference in this.
[00:21:58.806 --> 00:22:03.848]  I remember, folks, I was not even into politics in 2012.
[00:22:04.288 --> 00:22:07.249]  It wasn't until 2013 that I even had a clue what was going on.
[00:22:07.289 --> 00:22:11.390]  I was a total sheeple until 2013, the Boston Marathon bombing.
[00:22:11.751 --> 00:22:15.592]  But even I knew that Obama was going to win in a landslide against Romney.
[00:22:16.152 --> 00:22:21.116]  Because of how pathetic Romney's campaign was, and incumbent presidents usually win in a landslide.
[00:22:21.136 --> 00:22:24.879]  So Obama with 332 of the electoral vote last year, I don't think Trump will get that.
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:37.209]  But total, last year total votes, we had 122 million.
[00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.631]  I'm trying to do math here, live on air.
[00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:41.372]  I am no mathematician, folks.
[00:22:41.453 --> 00:22:42.834]  Let me just be perfectly honest with you.
[00:22:43.747 --> 00:22:46.188]  But I believe we had over 120 million votes last year.
[00:22:46.208 --> 00:22:52.609]  So it'll be interesting to see what the total vote number is at the end of the night, as far as how many people voted.
[00:22:52.649 --> 00:22:58.590]  But we're getting voter record and turnout, voter record and registration, so you would imagine it's going to go above and beyond that.
[00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.091]  Right now we are at 114 million total votes, both with 57 million right now.
[00:23:06.834 --> 00:23:13.383]  But if you guys could just pop this map up real quick, this is what it looks like it's going to be at the end of the night.
[00:23:13.543 --> 00:23:17.468]  At least this is how I think it's going to be when the night concludes.
[00:23:17.969 --> 00:23:18.610]  Donald Trump, 305.
[00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:19.191]  Hillary Clinton, 233.
[00:23:23.937 --> 00:23:26.060]  I believe this will be the final tabulation.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:39.839]  I remember going through this days and days ago, just switching it, looking at all the different formulas that could happen, all the different results, and I just did not see Hillary Clinton's true path to victory unless she totally stole this one.
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.421]  There you go, folks.
[00:23:41.601 --> 00:23:42.381]  It is official.
[00:23:42.441 --> 00:23:45.763]  Donald Trump is the next president of the United States.
[00:23:45.983 --> 00:23:47.324]  I gotta show you something, too.
[00:23:47.804 --> 00:23:48.905]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:23:49.185 --> 00:23:50.086]  Are you on air right now?
[00:23:50.286 --> 00:23:51.167]  I am on air right now.
[00:23:52.067 --> 00:23:54.809]  I actually did not vote for Donald Trump.
[00:23:54.829 --> 00:23:55.509]  Put it back where it was.
[00:23:55.529 --> 00:23:57.971]  My oldest daughter voted at school today in a mock election.
[00:23:58.031 --> 00:23:59.071]  Age 6 voted at her school.
[00:24:06.856 --> 00:24:07.837]  For Donald Trump.
[00:24:08.117 --> 00:24:10.779]  Well, she voted for Donald Trump, but... Donald Trump.
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:11.520]  Donald Trump.
[00:24:12.261 --> 00:24:13.262]  All the way.
[00:24:14.763 --> 00:24:15.804]  She voted at school today.
[00:24:15.944 --> 00:24:17.145]  Well, congratulations, Marcos.
[00:24:17.165 --> 00:24:18.766]  First grade knows what's up.
[00:24:18.906 --> 00:24:20.888]  So wait, you didn't vote for Trump, but your kid did?
[00:24:20.908 --> 00:24:23.290]  Yeah, yeah, she's better than me.
[00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:24.871]  I was gonna say... She's the next generation.
[00:24:24.911 --> 00:24:25.892]  She's gotta be better than me.
[00:24:25.912 --> 00:24:27.353]  So your kid is smarter than you are, then?
[00:24:28.254 --> 00:24:28.894]  Are you smarter than me?
[00:24:29.395 --> 00:24:30.416]  Are you leaving, Leigh-Anne?
[00:24:31.397 --> 00:24:31.817]  Alright.
[00:24:33.103 --> 00:24:34.103]  So there you go, folks.
[00:24:34.163 --> 00:24:35.884]  Donald Trump is your next president.
[00:24:36.624 --> 00:24:38.905]  Will the brainwashed masses admit they were duped?
[00:24:39.025 --> 00:24:40.206]  Again, I have to bring this up.
[00:24:40.286 --> 00:24:40.886]  The polls!
[00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:41.766]  The polls!
[00:24:41.806 --> 00:24:42.287]  The polls!
[00:24:42.347 --> 00:24:42.787]  The polls!
[00:24:42.847 --> 00:24:43.227]  The polls!
[00:24:43.267 --> 00:24:43.767]  The polls!
[00:24:44.187 --> 00:24:45.608]  The polls were wrong!
[00:24:45.848 --> 00:24:46.828]  They were rigged!
[00:24:47.148 --> 00:24:48.449]  I tried to tell you!
[00:24:48.469 --> 00:24:49.529]  In fact, you know what?
[00:24:49.629 --> 00:24:53.351]  I really hope my sister is tuned in right now, because my sister was one of the worst.
[00:24:53.891 --> 00:24:55.552]  She was totally depressed.
[00:24:56.252 --> 00:24:57.033]  Couldn't believe it.
[00:24:57.173 --> 00:24:58.353]  Hillary Clinton's gonna win.
[00:24:58.493 --> 00:25:00.875]  Like, when I'm talking to her on the phone, I can't believe it.
[00:25:00.975 --> 00:25:01.996]  Oh, and this is gonna happen.
[00:25:02.176 --> 00:25:03.316]  Donald Trump doesn't have a chance.
[00:25:03.336 --> 00:25:04.037]  Hillary's gonna win.
[00:25:04.097 --> 00:25:04.637]  It's over.
[00:25:04.737 --> 00:25:06.778]  I'm like, what are you talking about?
[00:25:06.798 --> 00:25:08.640]  What makes you say the polls, the polls, the polls?
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.641]  I told you they were rigged!
[00:25:10.661 --> 00:25:12.162]  I told you!
[00:25:12.182 --> 00:25:14.483]  I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
[00:25:14.543 --> 00:25:15.684]  I do my research.
[00:25:15.764 --> 00:25:17.225]  Okay, I'm gonna be done ranting.
[00:25:18.715 --> 00:25:19.696]  Here's what we got coming up.
[00:25:19.736 --> 00:25:22.498]  So, oh yeah, again, will Hillary Clinton try to blame Russia for this?
[00:25:22.638 --> 00:25:26.140]  I think that that cat has escaped the bag.
[00:25:26.921 --> 00:25:28.082]  Here's a question for you.
[00:25:29.423 --> 00:25:31.964]  So here are the questions, you know, here's the deal.
[00:25:31.984 --> 00:25:33.625]  You got five minutes as the caller.
[00:25:33.726 --> 00:25:35.006]  Five minutes, you're out.
[00:25:35.087 --> 00:25:36.528]  Five minute max, you're out.
[00:25:36.588 --> 00:25:38.729]  If you can get your comment in before that, great.
[00:25:39.189 --> 00:25:40.911]  More power to you, we can get to more callers.
[00:25:40.951 --> 00:25:42.632]  But here's some of the stuff we're going to talk about.
[00:25:44.071 --> 00:25:49.357]  Will the Clinton camp and the Obama camp try to demonize or blame Russia for this?
[00:25:50.719 --> 00:25:57.868]  Will the brainwashed sheeple admit they were duped, admit they were brainwashed, finally admit the mainstream news is totally fake?
[00:25:58.809 --> 00:26:00.451]  Now here's another one that I haven't brought up yet.
[00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:05.973]  What is the establishment more scared of right now?
[00:26:07.054 --> 00:26:15.382]  Is the establishment more scared of Donald Trump or is the establishment more scared of the fact that they no longer control us?
[00:26:15.782 --> 00:26:17.624]  That they no longer control the narrative?
[00:26:17.664 --> 00:26:20.766]  Because so much of what we've seen
[00:26:21.847 --> 00:26:35.433]  In this country, in my lifetime, in your lifetime, has been all based around the notion or fact that the establishment controls the narrative and that the establishment controls the population, see?
[00:26:38.034 --> 00:26:47.598]  So, have we reached the precipice now where that paradigm has been broken, where those shackles have been broken?
[00:26:48.723 --> 00:26:50.665]  And what is the establishment more scared of now?
[00:26:50.805 --> 00:26:51.605]  Donald Trump?
[00:26:52.046 --> 00:26:56.789]  Or the fact they've lost their power to control the narrative and control the population?
[00:27:00.083 --> 00:27:06.868]  I think one of the strongest points to a Trump administration is who he's going to put in positions of power.
[00:27:07.308 --> 00:27:28.584]  I think we finally have a candidate who's not going to be looking to put people in positions of power who are going to collude with him and the corrupt establishment, crony people who just want to become rich based on the ignorance of the American sheeple and the kind of, you know, foreign geopolitics they can play, pay-for-play programs, etc, etc.
[00:27:30.931 --> 00:27:38.133]  Will Donald Trump finally eradicate that type of crony system that's been eking its way into Washington?
[00:27:38.173 --> 00:27:44.775]  And will he finally put people in positions of power who care about this country, want to help this country, and not want to enrich themselves?
[00:27:45.235 --> 00:27:47.456]  Also, we're going to look at Hillary Clinton's Twitter account.
[00:27:47.936 --> 00:27:51.177]  Some interesting tweets coming out of Hillary Clinton tonight.
[00:27:51.237 --> 00:27:52.737]  I'm now joined by Leanne McAdoo.
[00:27:53.137 --> 00:27:54.337]  We're going to take your calls.
[00:27:54.377 --> 00:27:56.918]  Before we take your calls, Leanne, what are your thoughts right now?
[00:27:56.978 --> 00:27:58.038]  How are you feeling right now?
[00:27:58.098 --> 00:27:59.619]  What do you think about the things I just said?
[00:28:00.339 --> 00:28:11.322]  Totally unbelievable, and I'm trying to get Marcos to be able to pull it up to where we can see the responses from the mainstream establishment media.
[00:28:11.622 --> 00:28:26.486]  As much as you and I out there who are celebrating and cannot believe that this actually happened, the mainstream media who has been pushing this narrative for more than a year that there's no way Donald Trump can win, he's crazy, America is racist, sexist, xenophobic,
[00:28:26.986 --> 00:28:30.850]  Bigoted if they vote for him and now he is the president.
[00:28:31.491 --> 00:28:34.074]  I need to see the look on their faces.
[00:28:34.234 --> 00:28:35.355]  How do they feel?
[00:28:35.495 --> 00:28:36.456]  What are they saying?
[00:28:36.476 --> 00:28:43.023]  Well, I think tomorrow is going to be the ultimate to see how because because again, they think they control the narrative.
[00:28:43.043 --> 00:28:45.206]  They think that they control your thought pattern.
[00:28:45.506 --> 00:28:46.307]  We've defeated that.
[00:28:46.567 --> 00:28:49.829]  So how do they even approach their jobs bar?
[00:28:49.849 --> 00:28:52.551]  They're a total joke!
[00:28:52.791 --> 00:29:00.136]  You just, for the last year and a half, were putting out a story, putting out a narrative, putting out a prediction, and you look like an idiot!
[00:29:00.156 --> 00:29:05.459]  We already did not believe them, but now it's like their results right there are completely flipped!
[00:29:05.759 --> 00:29:07.440]  Are we able to go to that New York Times?
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.101]  Yeah, we can go to this right here.
[00:29:09.182 --> 00:29:13.124]  Are you able to scroll down where their predictions went askew?
[00:29:16.246 --> 00:29:16.867]  Oh, this is great.
[00:29:16.887 --> 00:29:17.767]  I know what you're talking about.
[00:29:17.787 --> 00:29:18.848]  I know what you're talking about.
[00:29:18.868 --> 00:29:19.428]  This is classic.
[00:29:19.508 --> 00:29:20.309]  No, this is classic.
[00:29:20.349 --> 00:29:22.991]  Here's where the forecast... Oh!
[00:29:26.533 --> 00:29:28.074]  We were completely wrong.
[00:29:28.094 --> 00:29:28.814]  Sorry.
[00:29:28.914 --> 00:29:29.795]  Right about here.
[00:29:29.855 --> 00:29:30.455]  Right about 8.30.
[00:29:30.776 --> 00:29:31.736]  Sorry folks.
[00:29:31.796 --> 00:29:37.319]  Somehow, somehow at 9.30pm reality just changed.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:48.226]  I don't know what happened but at 9.30pm the entire, 8.30pm the entire world switched on its hemisphere and now the entire world has changed somehow magically.
[00:29:48.826 --> 00:29:52.067]  But for the rest of us, we've been seeing this the entire time.
[00:29:52.107 --> 00:29:57.227]  We're like, look at the people that are turning up to the rallies, and then Hillary Clinton's got like 30 people.
[00:29:57.247 --> 00:30:00.888]  They're having to photoshop in people attending her rallies.
[00:30:00.908 --> 00:30:04.829]  And pay people to go, pay Jay-Z, Beyonce, LeBron James.
[00:30:04.849 --> 00:30:07.649]  That's where the reality flipped for them.
[00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:14.390]  That's where reality finally flipped for the establishment, where they were having that, oh shit moment, you know?
[00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:15.551]  Well, and here's the thing.
[00:30:15.671 --> 00:30:17.111]  You talk about the media response.
[00:30:18.527 --> 00:30:19.488]  Here's what I've seen.
[00:30:19.508 --> 00:30:27.413]  Can I just say, on camera, Marcos, can I get that on camera?
[00:30:27.433 --> 00:30:30.195]  They're busy back there.
[00:30:32.256 --> 00:30:34.037]  Hillary, you're fired.
[00:30:36.999 --> 00:30:37.560]  You're fired.
[00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:38.440]  You're fired, Hillary.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:38.981]  You're fired.
[00:30:40.219 --> 00:30:42.102]  Here's what I saw from the media response.
[00:30:42.182 --> 00:30:47.490]  Now, I woke up... I probably got out of bed at like 8 or 9.
[00:30:47.931 --> 00:30:49.073]  I got in here around 10.
[00:30:49.293 --> 00:30:52.958]  And I was monitoring the mainstream news before I got in here.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:31:02.102]  And most of them have been saying, shocking, you know, oh my, unbelievable, we can't believe it, this is breaking, how did this happen?
[00:31:02.142 --> 00:31:03.642]  Like it was some sort of a surprise.
[00:31:03.662 --> 00:31:04.362]  How did this happen?
[00:31:04.522 --> 00:31:12.684]  And these are the same people that will say Alex Jones is crazy, we're conspiracy theorists, you know, try to control the narrative, but yet, we were right.
[00:31:12.944 --> 00:31:17.025]  This isn't shocking, I'm not shocked, but hold on a second Leigh-Anne, I gotta call you out here.
[00:31:17.505 --> 00:31:23.966]  We work, me and Leigh-Anne's desk is in a close vicinity, and every day you had no faith, you never thought Trump could win.
[00:31:24.807 --> 00:31:44.742]  Well no, I didn't want to say it out loud because I'm kind of a fatalist and I'm always waiting for the rug to be pulled out and I don't trust, I do not trust, even still to this day with Hillary Clinton not making her concession speech because she has zero class and probably couldn't get out of her gurney to go and make this concession speech.
[00:31:45.342 --> 00:31:51.987]  But, you know, I'm always thinking, are they going to come up with these, oh, look, we just got a shipment in of these write-in ballots.
[00:31:52.027 --> 00:31:55.410]  You know, people just, I don't know where these came from, and we're going to give it to her.
[00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.071]  I'm always kind of waiting for that.
[00:31:57.112 --> 00:31:58.012]  I trust no one.
[00:31:58.032 --> 00:31:59.954]  I don't know why this is how I am.
[00:32:00.774 --> 00:32:05.758]  And that's why I have refused to say my predictions or whatever, because I didn't want to speak that into it.
[00:32:05.778 --> 00:32:06.319]  I told you.
[00:32:06.339 --> 00:32:08.080]  I tried to tell you.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.542]  You're a cocky son of a bitch.
[00:32:10.711 --> 00:32:12.773]  Kind of like, I guess me and Hillary have that in common.
[00:32:13.213 --> 00:32:14.694]  You know what, actually, this is funny.
[00:32:15.034 --> 00:32:16.856]  This is how I'm kind of picturing this.
[00:32:16.896 --> 00:32:17.957]  Hillary Clinton is like...
[00:32:19.622 --> 00:32:48.640]  The fake popular girl in school, who's not actually popular, nobody actually likes her, but you know, she's, you know, whatever, her parents are wealthy or something, she drives a fancy car, everybody wants to be friends with her, she's got, you know, the big boobs that she puts on display or whatever, everybody knows what I'm talking about, and prom season is coming around, and she's going around passing out her pamphlets, vote for me prom queen, and then she, you know, she walks by some certain people, bemoans them, insults them, is just really a total bitch, nobody in the school likes her, but see, but she's all
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.642]  And then goes out and is like, oh, I love puppies and kittens.
[00:32:51.662 --> 00:32:53.003]  Yeah, when she's on the stage.
[00:32:53.483 --> 00:32:54.964]  And then, but you know, she'll prop herself up.
[00:32:54.984 --> 00:32:55.905]  I'm the prom queen.
[00:32:55.945 --> 00:32:56.726]  She's all confident.
[00:32:56.746 --> 00:32:58.047]  There's no way anybody can beat her.
[00:32:59.315 --> 00:33:05.239]  And then, you know, the time comes where they select the prom queen, and it's not her.
[00:33:05.839 --> 00:33:06.800]  And it's not her.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.442]  And that's the moment that Hillary Clinton had today.
[00:33:10.082 --> 00:33:12.644]  And that's why she couldn't give a concession speech.
[00:33:13.224 --> 00:33:17.007]  That's why she had to call Donald Trump to concede.
[00:33:17.227 --> 00:33:22.911]  And again, in the final move of her entire campaign, she gives a middle finger
[00:33:23.351 --> 00:33:29.533]  To her voters, and abandons them, and leaves them hanging, and doesn't even speak to them.
[00:33:29.593 --> 00:33:32.014]  That is the true candidate that Hillary Clinton is.
[00:33:32.054 --> 00:33:33.274]  Well, I'm really curious.
[00:33:33.794 --> 00:33:35.415]  Like, what is she going to say tomorrow?
[00:33:35.435 --> 00:33:43.277]  When she comes out tomorrow, is she going to say, because President Obama, Michelle Obama, they're all out there saying, hope is on the ballot.
[00:33:44.037 --> 00:33:45.357]  Respect is on the ballot.
[00:33:45.397 --> 00:33:47.138]  Respect for women is on the ballot.
[00:33:47.438 --> 00:33:52.961]  Everything we've tried, everything we've done in the last eight years is on the ballot.
[00:33:53.361 --> 00:34:13.713]  Yeah, so she's gonna come out tomorrow and say, the basket of deplorables won, the dark hearts won, evil has totally taken over our country, all the racist, sexist bigots have won and decided, and like rile up her supporters, her base, who truly think in their mind this is the apocalypse.
[00:34:14.073 --> 00:34:16.794]  I mean, you have to understand, you've got to kind of see it from the flip side.
[00:34:16.834 --> 00:34:18.835]  In their mind, this is the apocalypse.
[00:34:18.855 --> 00:34:19.975]  Yeah, that's an interesting point.
[00:34:20.075 --> 00:34:20.596]  Is it though?
[00:34:20.696 --> 00:34:24.657]  Or will they finally wake up and realize they've been duped, realize they've been brainwashed?
[00:34:24.677 --> 00:34:29.879]  Well, I mean, it's like they didn't even wake up when they saw that the election was stolen from Bernie Sanders.
[00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:39.543]  I mean, in your face, stolen from Bernie Sanders, and then yet you still had, even at the DNC, you had some of Bernie's, like, top supporters running around and going,
[00:34:40.143 --> 00:34:41.924]  You know what, we just gotta vote for Hillary now.
[00:34:41.984 --> 00:34:46.508]  I know she's everything that Bernie stands against, but we just gotta get behind her.
[00:34:46.588 --> 00:34:52.312]  Even CNN tonight, even CNN tonight basically talked about how Hillary Clinton was the Wall Street candidate.
[00:34:52.332 --> 00:34:52.972]  It was pretty funny.
[00:34:53.192 --> 00:34:55.074]  While they were shocked at the results that they were seeing.
[00:34:55.834 --> 00:34:57.335]  But you know, here's what I think, Leigh-Anne.
[00:34:57.355 --> 00:35:00.738]  I think that, you know, Hillary has already failed so miserably.
[00:35:01.721 --> 00:35:06.985]  I think that what you're talking about, I think that that's actually going to be what Obama's job is for the next two months.
[00:35:07.105 --> 00:35:09.146]  Obviously, Obama's job is not to be the president.
[00:35:09.186 --> 00:35:10.087]  He's totally treasonous.
[00:35:10.367 --> 00:35:11.968]  He doesn't give a damn about the Constitution.
[00:35:11.988 --> 00:35:13.809]  He doesn't give a damn about the American people.
[00:35:14.149 --> 00:35:21.234]  He's got his own agendas, whether it be to play golf, visit Saudi Arabia, China, whatever it is, erode the U.S.
[00:35:21.274 --> 00:35:21.754]  Constitution.
[00:35:21.774 --> 00:35:23.496]  Literally to play golf for the rest of his days.
[00:35:23.516 --> 00:35:24.076]  Whatever it is.
[00:35:24.096 --> 00:35:28.399]  But I think what we might see here, because the establishment knows Hillary Clinton is a failed candidate.
[00:35:28.499 --> 00:35:29.580]  Nobody likes her.
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.301]  She's hideous to look at, even.
[00:35:31.961 --> 00:35:34.644]  Obama, you know... Has she disintegrated into a dark corner?
[00:35:34.684 --> 00:35:35.044]  She's gone.
[00:35:35.084 --> 00:35:35.885]  She's completely gone.
[00:35:35.925 --> 00:35:37.967]  I don't know if we'll ever see Hillary Clinton again, to be honest.
[00:35:38.287 --> 00:35:48.276]  But I think that for the next two months, Obama's agenda is going to be to do what you just said, which is try to demonize the Trump voters, you know, pretend this is the apocalypse.
[00:35:48.296 --> 00:35:49.657]  Dark times for America.
[00:35:49.777 --> 00:35:55.562]  Racism has returned, you know, bigotry has returned, trying to spark some sort of a
[00:35:56.383 --> 00:36:01.247]  You know, George Soros protest type of thing as we move into the Trump administration.
[00:36:01.267 --> 00:36:05.911]  Well, I'm trying to stay in celebration mode because we have just a short amount of time tomorrow.
[00:36:05.991 --> 00:36:06.692]  Everyone's going to wake up.
[00:36:06.752 --> 00:36:10.935]  I mean, we see already the mainstream media, those pundits are out there sort of spinning this.
[00:36:11.015 --> 00:36:14.518]  And I believe it was NBC earlier where they're saying, well.
[00:36:15.805 --> 00:36:20.889]  Some anonymous sources, some generals are saying... Hey, by the way, that's Brian Williams.
[00:36:20.949 --> 00:36:23.290]  Are we going to have to follow his orders?
[00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:25.432]  What are the constitutional guidelines?
[00:36:25.452 --> 00:36:30.395]  And it's like, no dude, they were not looking forward to having to follow Hillary Clinton's orders.
[00:36:30.415 --> 00:36:32.256]  Is there a more too pathetic people in media?
[00:36:32.777 --> 00:36:34.658]  Brian Williams and Rachel Maddow?
[00:36:34.898 --> 00:36:35.479]  Oh my.
[00:36:35.499 --> 00:36:36.359]  Rachel Maddow.
[00:36:36.379 --> 00:36:41.263]  Brian Williams actually reported that he was there when Hillary Clinton won the election tonight.
[00:36:42.253 --> 00:36:48.518]  Yeah, Brian Williams has actually been to Mars, and Rachel Maddow might be from Mars.
[00:36:49.679 --> 00:36:51.520]  Oh man, Rachel Maddow, is she crying?
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.922]  Hey Rachel, by the way, Rachel...

[00:38:32.303 --> 00:38:35.325]  Let's start off with Jacob in Oklahoma.
[00:38:35.425 --> 00:38:36.145]  Go ahead, Jacob.
[00:38:40.626 --> 00:38:42.547]  We are seeing the age... It's pretty late now.
[00:38:42.827 --> 00:38:43.367]  There we go.
[00:38:43.927 --> 00:38:44.967]  I'm sorry, go ahead, Jacob.
[00:38:45.067 --> 00:38:51.609]  Oh, no, I was just asking how y'all were doing this morning, early morning, with the victory.
[00:38:51.629 --> 00:38:55.630]  Caught the second wind after the Trump win, I gotta say.
[00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:59.091]  I'm going to have a good time tonight, I'll just put it that way.
[00:38:59.791 --> 00:39:00.952]  Having a good time tonight.
[00:39:01.352 --> 00:39:06.913]  Not tonight, I mean it's actually, now it's actually Wednesday, so Wednesday night I'm gonna have a good time.
[00:39:06.953 --> 00:39:08.874]  Jacob, did you do a victory dance?
[00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:13.413]  Uh, yeah, I did a victory dance.
[00:39:13.533 --> 00:39:35.011]  You know, this entire election, it's been obviously pretty clear cut between the two main candidates here, but you know, I never really looked a whole lot into Donald Trump, so there were a couple things that I wasn't so sure on, but I obviously, being a veteran, knew that Hillary Clinton was a horrible choice.
[00:39:37.745 --> 00:39:53.721]  So, I mean, I'm just glad that Trump won, because my God, if that woman had made it into, if that witch had made it into the presidency, we would be looking at a very interesting next four years, if our nation made it that far.
[00:39:54.001 --> 00:39:54.522]  Absolutely.
[00:39:54.562 --> 00:39:55.843]  I mean, think about it.
[00:39:56.424 --> 00:39:59.206]  You think they're kicking themselves right now if they would have just
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.985]  If the media would have treated Trump the same way, I think yeah.
[00:40:11.547 --> 00:40:12.447]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:12.487 --> 00:40:17.948]  They would have given Bernie Sanders the win because he had a lot of just support the same way Trump did.
[00:40:18.268 --> 00:40:23.589]  It was a lot of people who were mobilized to overthrow the system as it stands.
[00:40:23.649 --> 00:40:33.711]  Now, Bernie Sanders supporters maybe not understanding that they're trying to overthrow the system by giving the system all even more money and power, which was a little off base.
[00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:38.532]  But either way, we're seeing on both sides people just across the border saying enough with this system.
[00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:48.455]  I think a lot of Bernie supporters were kicking themselves whenever the nomination was stolen in the first place.
[00:40:49.296 --> 00:40:51.037]  That was definitely a big kick in the gut.
[00:40:51.057 --> 00:40:52.899]  Of course, I've never been a fan of Bernie Sanders.
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:41:03.227]  But no, actually, I think one of the reasons they may have gone with Hillary Clinton instead of Bernie Sanders is, you know, even though Bernie Sanders stands for what he stands for,
[00:41:04.117 --> 00:41:05.678]  At least he stands for something.
[00:41:05.778 --> 00:41:13.103]  He wasn't a readily malleable puppet like Clinton was.
[00:41:13.323 --> 00:41:16.805]  I'd have to disagree with you, Jacob, because what did Bernie Sanders stand for?
[00:41:16.865 --> 00:41:26.832]  He stood for big money out of politics, he stood for getting rid of big lobbyists, he stood for getting rid of big Wall Street influence, and then he endorsed Hillary Clinton, who is the candidate for all of that.
[00:41:27.532 --> 00:41:35.555]  After there was proof, documented proof, that the establishment had stolen, the entire system he's fighting against had stolen and rigged it against him.
[00:41:35.575 --> 00:41:38.816]  I'm still in a state of shock.
[00:41:41.037 --> 00:41:44.798]  Yeah, I'm not sure how the country didn't revolt when that happened.
[00:41:44.818 --> 00:41:53.461]  You know, it's funny, every step of the way through this election has just been one more thing added and it's just every time something happens,
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:42:00.842]  I just think that everything's going to break loose because there's just been so much stuff going on in this year, in this election.
[00:42:00.922 --> 00:42:06.463]  I mean, it literally is, it is, or it was, the make or break for our nation.
[00:42:08.064 --> 00:42:13.225]  Well, I think the reason why the country didn't revolt is because the country wasn't Bernie Sanders supporters.
[00:42:13.245 --> 00:42:14.546]  The country was Trump supporters.
[00:42:14.606 --> 00:42:15.506]  We are the country.
[00:42:15.626 --> 00:42:16.046]  Exactly.
[00:42:16.066 --> 00:42:18.907]  So we weren't the ones that had our primaries stolen from us.
[00:42:19.167 --> 00:42:23.128]  Of course, the Woozies and the Foozies and the Fazzies and the Wazzies on the Democratic
[00:42:23.148 --> 00:42:23.308]  Oh yeah.
[00:42:46.525 --> 00:42:47.446]  Sarah Silverman.
[00:42:47.566 --> 00:42:50.490]  Did you see Sarah Silverman's tweet by the way?
[00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:52.192]  Sarah Silverman tweeted earlier.
[00:42:52.753 --> 00:42:54.415]  Somebody give me hope!
[00:42:54.855 --> 00:42:56.377]  Well I got hope for ya.
[00:42:56.437 --> 00:42:57.739]  I got hope for ya.
[00:42:57.939 --> 00:42:58.720]  Here's hope for ya.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.282]  Southwest Airlines.
[00:43:00.322 --> 00:43:00.802]  Southwest.
[00:43:02.364 --> 00:43:07.128]  SouthwestAirlines.com, go ahead and book yourself a one-way flight out of this country, Sarah Silverman.
[00:43:07.148 --> 00:43:08.329]  Thank you for the call.
[00:43:08.469 --> 00:43:09.329]  Thank you, Jacob.
[00:43:09.469 --> 00:43:16.134]  Actually, did you see that Canada's immigration website crashed because of these people freaking out?
[00:43:16.174 --> 00:43:17.235]  I'm not even kidding you, Leanne.
[00:43:17.295 --> 00:43:17.976]  I'm not even kidding you.
[00:43:17.996 --> 00:43:18.496]  That's so racist though.
[00:43:18.756 --> 00:43:21.198]  Why didn't Mexico's immigration server crash?
[00:43:21.218 --> 00:43:22.079]  Well, the wall.
[00:43:22.439 --> 00:43:23.160]  Why are you being racist?
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.861]  Like, why not go to Mexico though?
[00:43:24.881 --> 00:43:28.504]  You know, why does Canada look so great?
[00:43:28.624 --> 00:43:29.324]  I have a friend.
[00:43:30.285 --> 00:43:37.915]  I have a Canadian friend who's in the United States on a work visa who actually thought she was going to get deported.
[00:43:40.678 --> 00:43:41.499]  I swear, I'm not even kidding.
[00:43:41.519 --> 00:43:43.882]  I told her, I was like, hey, I was like, look, you know.
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:48.382]  Donald Trump doesn't want to deport everybody who's not a citizen.
[00:43:49.002 --> 00:43:53.944]  All he wants to do is enforce immigration law and get the criminals out.
[00:43:53.964 --> 00:43:54.484]  That's it.
[00:43:54.544 --> 00:44:08.411]  And give Border Patrol the power to deport these people and do what they need to do to process these people who we just had someone here in Tyler, Texas, who had been deported on multiple occasions, who killed a little girl that was known to him.
[00:44:08.451 --> 00:44:11.192]  A 10-year-old girl and threw her body in a well.
[00:44:11.892 --> 00:44:18.374]  So, I mean, we're seeing these type of things again and again and again with people who are being deported and then they come back and there's nothing they can do.
[00:44:18.434 --> 00:44:19.275]  Their hands are tied.
[00:44:19.335 --> 00:44:21.716]  Hopefully that will change.
[00:44:22.136 --> 00:44:25.277]  Donald Trump, like, you know, he was one of the only people that went to the border.
[00:44:25.657 --> 00:44:26.877]  President Obama never went.
[00:44:27.218 --> 00:44:31.379]  That's why they took his statement about, you know, Mexicans when they come to the border, blah, blah, blah.
[00:44:31.399 --> 00:44:38.622]  They took it out of context because he said that while he visited the border and spoke to the Border Patrol and he was the only one.
[00:44:39.722 --> 00:44:45.231]  The winner, actually, of the election tonight is President Trump in the building.
[00:44:45.992 --> 00:44:46.453]  We know.
[00:44:46.473 --> 00:44:47.695]  We did it!
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:54.801]  Trump, you are big league right now.
[00:44:54.821 --> 00:44:57.003]  I'm Donald Trump, I'm your next president, 45th right here.
[00:44:57.023 --> 00:44:58.884]  I just want to go ahead and make an announcement right now.
[00:44:59.144 --> 00:44:59.984]  Very high energy.
[00:45:00.005 --> 00:45:06.189]  The brand new lead for the show Orange is the New Black is going to be Hillary Clinton for next season.
[00:45:06.469 --> 00:45:07.810]  Yeah!
[00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:09.251]  Hillary, you're fired.
[00:45:09.271 --> 00:45:11.492]  Oh, and by the way, Hillary Clinton, you're fired.
[00:45:14.494 --> 00:45:15.094]  That is it!
[00:45:15.135 --> 00:45:15.855]  We won!
[00:45:16.075 --> 00:45:16.876]  It is over!
[00:45:17.076 --> 00:45:18.016]  We're vindicated!
[00:45:18.197 --> 00:45:18.777]  It's done!
[00:45:19.057 --> 00:45:19.958]  Trump wins!
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.583]  We beat them all.
[00:45:25.343 --> 00:45:26.744]  Donald, Donald!
[00:45:26.905 --> 00:45:34.411]  I know that you were sure that you had this, you were confident the entire time, but seriously, I mean, up to the wire!
[00:45:34.431 --> 00:45:36.092]  It was up to the wire.
[00:45:36.132 --> 00:45:39.275]  I mean, we were all just like hanging on to the edge of our seat.
[00:45:39.335 --> 00:45:40.036]  What were you really thinking?
[00:45:40.076 --> 00:45:42.357]  All I gotta say is watch out, China.
[00:45:43.358 --> 00:45:46.520]  Watch out, we're going to make deals, they're going to be so great.
[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:52.122]  We're going to win so much that we're going to get tired of winning, but we're going to keep winning.
[00:45:52.903 --> 00:45:53.703]  I gotta go home.
[00:45:54.584 --> 00:45:57.165]  Wow, you deserve it.
[00:45:59.326 --> 00:46:02.427]  Like he said, Hillary, she's going to be in jail.
[00:46:02.567 --> 00:46:03.788]  Oh my god, I just can't even.
[00:46:03.948 --> 00:46:05.649]  Is he really going to put her in prison?
[00:46:07.009 --> 00:46:08.329]  Donald Trump, I need to know.
[00:46:08.369 --> 00:46:14.531]  Don't pass off my... We're gonna have Donald Trump hanging out with us all night, folks.
[00:46:15.731 --> 00:46:16.872]  That's good, Donald.
[00:46:17.452 --> 00:46:18.472]  Oh my God.
[00:46:18.972 --> 00:46:19.092]  Yes.
[00:46:20.012 --> 00:46:20.853]  Yes.
[00:46:21.033 --> 00:46:21.833]  Who cares right now?
[00:46:22.153 --> 00:46:23.793]  We just want America!
[00:46:25.554 --> 00:46:26.594]  America's back!
[00:46:27.114 --> 00:46:30.255]  You tell the world that America is back!
[00:46:30.815 --> 00:46:31.235]  All right.
[00:46:31.475 --> 00:46:32.096]  Oh my God.
[00:46:32.116 --> 00:46:33.696]  And by the way, folks, let me just tell you.
[00:46:35.438 --> 00:46:39.622]  People all over the planet are cheering that America got this election right, folks.
[00:46:42.677 --> 00:46:46.518]  You think about Donald Trump, no matter who Donald Trump is, what he's done in the past, folks.
[00:46:47.018 --> 00:46:48.838]  This isn't about Donald Trump.
[00:46:48.878 --> 00:46:52.879]  This is about the fact that America's finally broken the shackles.
[00:46:53.059 --> 00:46:58.921]  We have finally beaten the brainwashing, beaten the conditioning, and beat the establishment.
[00:46:59.001 --> 00:47:02.141]  That is what the world has been waiting for America to do for so long.
[00:47:02.502 --> 00:47:04.922]  Brexit 2.0 just happened tonight.
[00:47:04.982 --> 00:47:06.823]  Donald Trump is the next president.
[00:47:07.163 --> 00:47:08.523]  He gets inaugurated in January.
[00:47:08.863 --> 00:47:11.185]  Let's go out to Nicholas in Florida.
[00:47:11.265 --> 00:47:12.066]  Go ahead, Nicholas.
[00:47:12.406 --> 00:47:14.348]  This is Mary Trump-us.
[00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:18.631]  Mary Trump-us.
[00:47:19.732 --> 00:47:21.313]  Go Trump, go!
[00:47:21.934 --> 00:47:23.415]  Go Trump, go!
[00:47:23.435 --> 00:47:25.977]  Hey America, what do you say?
[00:47:26.117 --> 00:47:28.079]  Trump has already won today.
[00:47:28.099 --> 00:47:29.620]  Alright, we got Nicholas.
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:30.340]  Nicholas is gone.
[00:47:30.641 --> 00:47:32.122]  Let's go out to Al.
[00:47:32.142 --> 00:47:32.802]  Go ahead, Al.
[00:47:36.145 --> 00:47:37.787]  In Oregon from Texas.
[00:47:38.706 --> 00:47:41.587]  Yeah, I'm originally from Texas, but I live in a blue state right now.
[00:47:41.607 --> 00:47:42.248]  I live in Oregon.
[00:47:42.268 --> 00:47:43.988]  I tell you what, voters are scary out here.
[00:47:44.509 --> 00:47:47.030]  They are totally just freaking out now.
[00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:48.751]  They think they're going to be deported.
[00:47:48.891 --> 00:47:51.672]  Even people who've lived here for generations.
[00:47:51.792 --> 00:48:01.336]  My girlfriend's mother, her ancestry is German, and she's, of course, they've lived here for years, but she thinks she's going to get deported.
[00:48:01.796 --> 00:48:02.977]  They are so crazy out here.
[00:48:03.317 --> 00:48:04.477]  I'm telling you, it's the media.
[00:48:04.497 --> 00:48:05.918]  They brainwashed him into thinking that.
[00:48:05.938 --> 00:48:08.379]  They have ramped up that fear factor.
[00:48:08.399 --> 00:48:09.879]  People truly believe this.
[00:48:09.919 --> 00:48:14.701]  And that's why you can't get mad at people who voted on the other side with that thinking.
[00:48:14.721 --> 00:48:19.063]  Folks, let me tell you, we're just going to deport the criminals, okay?
[00:48:19.563 --> 00:48:24.445]  If you're a good citizen, if you have a job, if you pay the taxes, we want you here, folks.
[00:48:24.465 --> 00:48:25.605]  We're going to build this country.
[00:48:25.625 --> 00:48:27.206]  We're going to make America great again.
[00:48:27.346 --> 00:48:30.410]  Donald Trump, you really do have tiny hands now that I'm looking.
[00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:33.835]  Compared to my head, my hands might be a little small.
[00:48:34.235 --> 00:48:36.658]  But the wall is going to be huge.
[00:48:37.319 --> 00:48:37.960]  It's going to be huge.
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:39.062]  The wall will be huge.
[00:48:39.162 --> 00:48:40.523]  It's going to be a big, beautiful wall.
[00:48:40.944 --> 00:48:42.426]  Mexico is going to pay for the wall.
[00:48:42.446 --> 00:48:43.688]  But I want to let you know...
[00:48:44.673 --> 00:48:49.399]  We're only going to deport you if you're breaking the law, if you have a job, if you pay your taxes.
[00:48:49.659 --> 00:48:50.861]  We want you to be a citizen.
[00:48:50.881 --> 00:48:52.883]  It's the bad hombres, folks.
[00:48:52.903 --> 00:48:54.044]  There are bad hombres out there.
[00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:54.505]  Bad hombres.
[00:48:54.525 --> 00:48:55.406]  Very bad hombres.
[00:48:55.426 --> 00:48:56.507]  We're going to get rid of those hombres.
[00:48:56.527 --> 00:49:03.976]  Al, but so what do you think about the conditioning that people, they truly believe that they're just going to be rounded up FEMA camp style?
[00:49:04.737 --> 00:49:06.098]  Well, Leigh-Anne, I'll tell you this.
[00:49:06.218 --> 00:49:13.362]  I mean, living in Oregon after, you know, being from Texas and, you know, coming out here and seeing how they are, it's really scary.
[00:49:13.662 --> 00:49:16.344]  They are on a totally different level.
[00:49:16.404 --> 00:49:23.968]  They don't know what planet they're on, and they just wander around just chilling for Hillary like it's what they're supposed to do.
[00:49:24.368 --> 00:49:25.069]  I'm from Oregon.
[00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.749]  It's a blue state.
[00:49:25.789 --> 00:49:26.830]  That's what I'm supposed to vote.
[00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:29.952]  And most of the people were for Sanders.
[00:49:30.012 --> 00:49:30.812]  They hated Hillary.
[00:49:30.992 --> 00:49:32.033]  Then when Sanders told
[00:49:33.072 --> 00:49:33.653]  We're good to go.
[00:49:54.854 --> 00:50:00.778]  And we have, uh, you know, we listen to you, uh, you know, almost as much as we can through this thing when we're not at work.
[00:50:00.978 --> 00:50:05.320]  Once we get home, we've been totally on you guys, and this has been the best coverage.
[00:50:05.701 --> 00:50:09.503]  It's almost better than Hunter S. Thompson's Spirian Loving on the campaign trail in 72.
[00:50:09.543 --> 00:50:09.823]  I mean, you...
[00:50:11.644 --> 00:50:14.328]  You guys have become the story.
[00:50:14.669 --> 00:50:17.893]  InfoWars has become the story and that's why we push you guys.
[00:50:18.334 --> 00:50:23.121]  We give your bumper stickers to everybody out here because Oregon is completely zombified.
[00:50:23.482 --> 00:50:24.123]  We don't care.
[00:50:28.254 --> 00:50:33.558]  You know, the only way Alex Jones grows, the only way InfoWars grows is from you.
[00:50:34.058 --> 00:50:40.562]  We don't get, you know, we don't buy major ad space, we don't have people promoting us like celebrities or anything like that.
[00:50:40.782 --> 00:50:42.103]  Jones gives it away for free.
[00:50:42.183 --> 00:50:42.524]  Exactly.
[00:50:42.544 --> 00:50:45.085]  If you want to pick up the show and put your own commercials in there, do it, go for it.
[00:50:45.105 --> 00:50:47.387]  Hey guys, this is what's going on in, it looks like Oakland.
[00:50:47.667 --> 00:50:54.152]  Oh, LAPD's, yes, LAPD did say that they were going to be prepared for riots if Donald Trump won.
[00:50:54.372 --> 00:50:54.672]  Oh my.
[00:50:55.092 --> 00:51:01.998]  And is this, these Agitprop... We're so mad Donald Trump won, we gotta burn stuff.
[00:51:02.739 --> 00:51:04.700]  They didn't pay us our $16 an hour.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.562]  Is that Rob on the board right now?
[00:51:07.282 --> 00:51:11.166]  We're so mad that Donald Trump won, we gotta burn stuff, alright?
[00:51:11.266 --> 00:51:13.568]  We gotta get out of our way, we're awesome!
[00:51:14.028 --> 00:51:15.689]  We're gonna burn it down!
[00:51:15.729 --> 00:51:17.289]  We were promised everything!
[00:51:17.369 --> 00:51:20.630]  Let's hope that this does not start happening.
[00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:25.831]  People vandalizing and robbing because Donald Trump won.
[00:51:25.851 --> 00:51:28.052]  Well, Hillary Clinton promised them jobs, okay?
[00:51:28.072 --> 00:51:32.193]  You mean, you don't like social justice warriors getting on the mic and telling you what's right?
[00:51:34.234 --> 00:51:34.674]  You know what?
[00:51:34.694 --> 00:51:41.456]  All these social justice warriors, I guess they want to burn down America so that... Well, you know, it is Western values.
[00:51:44.676 --> 00:51:48.401]  Yeah, so I guess the uh... You gotta fight for your right to party!
[00:51:48.441 --> 00:51:49.362]  Hey, you know what though?
[00:51:49.523 --> 00:51:50.224]  You know what though?
[00:51:50.344 --> 00:51:52.487]  This is actually... I hate western values!
[00:51:53.703 --> 00:51:54.863]  This is actually interesting.
[00:51:55.324 --> 00:51:57.384]  So, Rob, you're saying that was from Oklahoma?
[00:51:57.984 --> 00:51:58.404]  Oakland.
[00:51:58.905 --> 00:51:59.345]  Oakland.
[00:51:59.545 --> 00:51:59.825]  Oh, okay.
[00:51:59.925 --> 00:52:01.045]  Oak-town.
[00:52:01.245 --> 00:52:01.846]  Oakland, okay.
[00:52:01.886 --> 00:52:02.926]  New West Side.
[00:52:03.306 --> 00:52:06.467]  So, yeah, California, I guess, is ripe for protest now.
[00:52:07.047 --> 00:52:07.967]  Oh, yeah.
[00:52:07.988 --> 00:52:09.168]  I talked about that earlier.
[00:52:09.408 --> 00:52:11.669]  LAPD said that they were going to a riot formation.
[00:52:11.689 --> 00:52:12.149]  Is that a fire?
[00:52:12.169 --> 00:52:12.609]  We're so mad!
[00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:13.749]  That's a fire.
[00:52:13.849 --> 00:52:16.570]  Because they were ready for this to happen.
[00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:19.671]  They were ready for these... But think about it.
[00:52:19.711 --> 00:52:21.412]  This is the same... Oh, Lord Jesus!
[00:52:22.772 --> 00:52:23.793]  This is the same line!
[00:52:23.813 --> 00:52:24.854]  Anybody got time for that?
[00:52:25.174 --> 00:52:30.258]  Anybody, any excuse, any excuse we have to go burn and loot, we're gonna do it.
[00:52:31.438 --> 00:52:34.140]  Where's that Bob Marley song, Burnin' and Lootin'?
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:34.961]  I love that song.
[00:52:35.001 --> 00:52:40.024]  You know what though, here's the good news, these people... Burnin' and lootin' tonight.
[00:52:40.084 --> 00:52:43.287]  That's a good song, that did not sound like the actual song, but that was pretty good.
[00:52:43.307 --> 00:52:46.329]  Burnin' and lootin' tonight.
[00:52:46.889 --> 00:52:54.056]  But here's the thing, they're not going to have the time and energy for this soon, because Donald Trump is going to give them a job.
[00:52:54.797 --> 00:52:57.860]  So then they don't have to rob, they don't have to loot, they don't have to burn.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:05.247]  They're going to want to go to bed, because they're going to have to get up tomorrow for their job, hopefully in a manufacturing company, because we're bringing manufacturing back to America.
[00:53:05.367 --> 00:53:07.288]  Yeah, let the dust settle a little bit.
[00:53:07.348 --> 00:53:14.671]  Let him show you what he said he's going to do for this country, whereas Hillary Clinton has just filled your head with lies.
[00:53:15.411 --> 00:53:32.318]  She's a total figment of everyone's imagination, which is why she couldn't even come out and do her concession speech, because she either missed her shipment of baby's blood to reinvigorate her for her concession speech, or she has puffed up into a
[00:53:33.158 --> 00:53:33.979]  A ball of dust!
[00:53:34.399 --> 00:53:46.491]  And she is no longer... Or, as David Knight tweeted out earlier, if you can go to his Twitter, he actually has footage of why Hillary Clinton was not able to make her concession speech tonight.
[00:53:47.011 --> 00:53:48.072]  I tweeted it out as well.
[00:53:50.254 --> 00:53:54.358]  Maybe she's going to one last pizza party at Comet Pizza and Ping Pong.
[00:53:54.458 --> 00:53:57.741]  All I gotta say is, ding dong, the witch is dead.
[00:53:58.513 --> 00:53:59.914]  Alright, let's take another caller.
[00:54:00.014 --> 00:54:03.175]  Let's go to Dylan in West Virginia.
[00:54:03.195 --> 00:54:04.295]  Go ahead, Dylan.
[00:54:06.736 --> 00:54:08.056]  America!
[00:54:08.417 --> 00:54:09.097]  Oh my God!
[00:54:09.337 --> 00:54:10.717]  America!
[00:54:11.898 --> 00:54:13.498]  Oh, I can't say it, but yeah!
[00:54:13.698 --> 00:54:19.240]  I don't know, I think it's a late... America!
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.281]  It's like the late... It's a late night hour.
[00:54:25.943 --> 00:54:34.087]  Oh my god, are we about to see an Arab greater than what we saw back when, um, what's his name?
[00:54:34.107 --> 00:54:40.610]  I'm thinking about Allen Iverson and all these basketball people with New World Orders trying to bring about us in the media.
[00:54:41.331 --> 00:54:42.491]  Uh, Eisenhower, man.
[00:54:42.811 --> 00:54:44.592]  Is this an Arab better than Eisenhower?
[00:54:44.712 --> 00:54:46.293]  Is that what we're getting to in this country?
[00:54:47.577 --> 00:54:48.598]  I don't think we know yet.
[00:54:48.958 --> 00:55:06.568]  You know, I think that we can take Donald Trump for what he's been, what he's said through this election cycle, but I don't think we truly know what to expect from the Trump administration, what to expect from the American society with a Trump presidency.
[00:55:06.628 --> 00:55:09.430]  I think that it'll be very interesting to see.
[00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:11.671]  We've still got two months left of Obama.
[00:55:12.231 --> 00:55:17.496]  He'll try to do whatever he can to try to muddy the waters before Trump even gets into office.
[00:55:17.536 --> 00:55:20.418]  So a lot to keep our eye on the ball here.
[00:55:20.478 --> 00:55:20.639]  Right.
[00:55:20.679 --> 00:55:23.741]  I mean, just think of how everyone was so excited with the Brexit vote.
[00:55:23.941 --> 00:55:26.624]  And then, of course, now we're seeing that they've kind of solved it.
[00:55:26.804 --> 00:55:29.426]  At first, they were saying it was like total apocalypse level.
[00:55:29.887 --> 00:55:30.988]  Everything was going to crash.
[00:55:31.028 --> 00:55:32.169]  You've made the worst decision.
[00:55:32.209 --> 00:55:34.311]  And then it was like, oh, well, it really wasn't that bad.
[00:55:34.671 --> 00:55:36.833]  And now they have all of these elites in there saying,
[00:55:37.153 --> 00:55:39.375]  We're not going to honor the vote of the people.
[00:55:39.395 --> 00:55:45.759]  So now there's a huge march being led by Nigel Farage to ensure that this actually happens.
[00:55:45.839 --> 00:55:47.160]  The people voted for Brexit.
[00:55:47.621 --> 00:55:51.363]  So, you know, we might see some of that kind of stuff here in the U.S.
[00:55:51.483 --> 00:55:54.786]  They might say, look, Donald, you know, you're the president now.
[00:55:54.846 --> 00:55:56.767]  We've already started World War III.
[00:55:56.807 --> 00:55:57.868]  I trust Hillary!
[00:55:58.288 --> 00:56:02.891]  Yeah, we've already started the war, and then they pin it on him, and they say, look, see?
[00:56:03.091 --> 00:56:05.493]  We told you you shouldn't elect Hitler.
[00:56:05.653 --> 00:56:06.574]  We tried to tell you.
[00:56:07.034 --> 00:56:10.356]  Meanwhile, Lady Gaga is actually wearing her Nazi uniform.
[00:56:10.376 --> 00:56:11.257]  Literally Hitler.
[00:56:12.237 --> 00:56:21.944]  But they'll say Donald Trump is literally Hitler, and then a Nazi collaborator, George Soros, is working with Hillary Clinton in all the emails.
[00:56:22.004 --> 00:56:23.405]  Lady Gaga wears the
[00:56:24.345 --> 00:56:26.506]  Dylan, are you still there?
[00:56:26.666 --> 00:56:28.887]  Sorry, we're just blabbering on.
[00:56:29.047 --> 00:56:30.507]  I'm not sure if we still have Dylan.
[00:56:42.409 --> 00:56:43.850]  In West Virginia.
[00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:45.531]  I'm not sure if we still have a crew.
[00:56:46.132 --> 00:56:46.812]  I don't even know.
[00:56:46.832 --> 00:56:49.974]  I don't think anyone's... Nobody's bad.
[00:56:50.254 --> 00:56:53.997]  But West Virginia was actually one of those states that called it right away.
[00:56:54.017 --> 00:56:54.897]  It was like boom.
[00:56:54.937 --> 00:56:56.478]  They didn't even... Kind of like California.
[00:56:56.498 --> 00:56:56.999]  There she is.
[00:56:57.119 --> 00:56:58.460]  Where there was zero tallies.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:04.804]  And so obviously this is the jacket that Lady Gaga bought from Michael Jackson's collection or whatever
[00:57:04.964 --> 00:57:05.385]  Wrong.
[00:57:05.525 --> 00:57:11.391]  Michael Jackson had red stripes going down the side of his pants and on the arms.
[00:57:11.571 --> 00:57:12.372]  Not like this.
[00:57:12.392 --> 00:57:13.954]  This was clearly a message.
[00:57:14.294 --> 00:57:16.096]  This is my, well, okay, here's the thing.
[00:57:16.196 --> 00:57:21.281]  This is the thing that Michael Jackson wore when he went to go visit some president, you know, decades ago.
[00:57:21.362 --> 00:57:24.004]  So she's like, I'm going to wear it too because I'm with her.
[00:57:24.024 --> 00:57:25.326]  It doesn't matter.
[00:57:25.866 --> 00:57:29.631]  Even at the time when Michael Jackson wore it, everyone was like, what the F?
[00:57:29.691 --> 00:57:32.374]  Why are you wearing Nazi uniform?
[00:57:32.935 --> 00:57:34.937]  It was even weird when Michael Jackson did it.
[00:57:35.298 --> 00:57:38.782]  But he was weird and had a lot of weird, creepy stuff.
[00:57:38.862 --> 00:57:43.307]  And now that he's dead and gone, you know, R.I.P., loved his music, but...
[00:57:44.188 --> 00:57:51.450]  We realized that he was doing some weird creepy stuff and so here we have Lady Gaga who was also tied up in some weird creepy stuff.
[00:57:52.430 --> 00:58:10.593]  Isn't it crazy how we have Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, you know, a lot of these people who are into witchcraft and goblins and our crew back there who likes to leave the microphones open so everyone can hear them talking.
[00:58:10.613 --> 00:58:12.834]  Thank you for doing that smoothly, Leigh-Anne.
[00:58:14.295 --> 00:58:16.036]  Anyway, the Nazi memorabilia.
[00:58:16.056 --> 00:58:16.736]  Very subtle.
[00:58:16.856 --> 00:58:19.217]  Very subtle with the Nazi memorabilia.
[00:58:19.257 --> 00:58:19.838]  Very subtle.
[00:58:20.878 --> 00:58:22.419]  Very subtle, kind of like when we're on air.
[00:58:22.439 --> 00:58:23.519]  Okay.
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:29.122]  Alright, let's go to Ron in Texas.
[00:58:30.042 --> 00:58:30.782]  Go ahead, Ron.
[00:58:30.802 --> 00:58:35.465]  Hello?
[00:58:35.625 --> 00:58:35.945]  Hello?
[00:58:36.125 --> 00:58:36.765]  Can you hear me?
[00:58:36.845 --> 00:58:38.226]  Oh yeah, Trump victory.
[00:58:39.281 --> 00:58:41.463]  Hey, good job guys.
[00:58:41.483 --> 00:58:42.524]  I appreciate the work.
[00:58:42.544 --> 00:58:43.384]  Trump kicks ass.
[00:58:43.404 --> 00:58:44.005]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[00:58:44.045 --> 00:58:45.166]  Good job, I appreciate it.
[00:58:45.326 --> 00:58:50.309]  Hey Owen, I was thinking about the new female version of the Aiden Skrillex.
[00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:54.132]  I think his name is Jezebel Skrillex.
[00:59:10.077 --> 00:59:13.959]  Think about how many people this election cycle... Okay, wait a minute, Owen.
[00:59:13.999 --> 00:59:15.319]  What is that girl doing right now tonight?
[00:59:15.379 --> 00:59:16.040]  Where is that girl?
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:16.700]  I don't know.
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:19.021]  Is she having a meltdown?
[00:59:33.683 --> 00:59:34.824]  Like, or is she asleep?
[00:59:34.844 --> 00:59:35.384]  That's what I'm saying!
[00:59:35.404 --> 00:59:36.285]  That's what I'm saying!
[00:59:36.305 --> 00:59:44.230]  What are the Hillary Clinton supporters doing that were so brainwashed into thinking this thing was already decided?
[00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:47.152]  If you support Trump, you're so stupid because it's already decided.
[00:59:47.193 --> 00:59:48.473]  You're probably racist and all this stuff.
[00:59:48.513 --> 00:59:49.454]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[00:59:49.654 --> 00:59:55.899]  Is their reality, is their reality being completely crushed in front of their eyes?
[00:59:56.499 --> 01:00:00.362]  Or are they somehow tricking themselves into thinking that
[01:00:02.083 --> 01:00:03.884]  Again, I don't even know where their thought goes.
[01:00:03.904 --> 01:00:04.905]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:00:05.305 --> 01:00:05.986]  Do they wake up?
[01:00:06.026 --> 01:00:07.266]  Do they see that they've been lied to?
[01:00:07.306 --> 01:00:08.467]  Do they see that they've been duped?
[01:00:08.487 --> 01:00:09.408]  Do they look in the mirror?
[01:00:09.428 --> 01:00:15.431]  Does female aide Skrillex look in the mirror and say, wow, what the hell is wrong with me?
[01:00:16.172 --> 01:00:19.954]  Or does she look in the mirror and say, I have to fight harder!
[01:00:20.615 --> 01:00:21.975]  I have to stop Donald Trump!
[01:00:22.496 --> 01:00:23.416]  He is a racist!
[01:00:23.596 --> 01:00:24.657]  He hates gay people!
[01:00:24.957 --> 01:00:26.918]  He's going to send everybody to Mexico!
[01:00:27.819 --> 01:00:29.200]  I have to fight harder now!
[01:00:30.407 --> 01:00:32.928]  It's gonna, I mean, which way does it go for these freaks?
[01:00:34.369 --> 01:00:34.809]  I don't know.
[01:00:34.829 --> 01:00:40.612]  The thing that I don't like is that that happens to be at an establishment that I like to frequent.
[01:00:41.052 --> 01:00:41.572]  Oh boy, oh boy.
[01:00:41.592 --> 01:00:44.553]  So now I'm going to see female astrologists.
[01:00:44.593 --> 01:00:46.334]  She's never going back, Leanne.
[01:00:46.614 --> 01:00:54.918]  Let me tell you, when she assaulted a man, I mean, she slapped him in the face, she spit on me, so she assaulted two people that night.
[01:00:55.198 --> 01:00:56.078]  She's never going back.
[01:00:56.458 --> 01:00:58.239]  You know what, I'll tell you, actually I have a response now.
[01:00:58.259 --> 01:00:59.460]  You know what she's doing?
[01:01:00.373 --> 01:01:03.774]  Hillary Clinton supporters are going to do the exact same thing that Hillary Clinton did.
[01:01:04.334 --> 01:01:05.115]  They're hiding.
[01:01:05.135 --> 01:01:07.295]  They're covering their faces.
[01:01:07.335 --> 01:01:07.916]  They're hiding.
[01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:08.656]  They're cowering.
[01:01:08.676 --> 01:01:09.636]  They're so embarrassed.
[01:01:09.656 --> 01:01:10.617]  They don't know what to do.
[01:01:10.797 --> 01:01:12.617]  Can we pull up that tweet please?
[01:01:13.017 --> 01:01:14.318]  David Knight tweeted it out.
[01:01:14.418 --> 01:01:15.578]  I also retweeted it.
[01:01:16.079 --> 01:01:20.480]  Why Hillary Clinton was not able to make her concession speech tonight.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:24.161]  Also where Hillary Clinton supporters are going to be.
[01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:26.922]  And it's going to be very interesting.
[01:01:26.962 --> 01:01:27.923]  I mean at some point
[01:01:28.783 --> 01:01:29.783]  Not that one there.
[01:01:29.943 --> 01:01:30.484]  You're fired.
[01:01:30.744 --> 01:01:31.184]  You're fired.
[01:01:31.764 --> 01:01:32.544]  Right there, David Knight.
[01:01:32.765 --> 01:01:35.606]  There it is.
[01:01:35.746 --> 01:01:36.986]  Hey, Owen.
[01:01:37.086 --> 01:01:37.806]  Go ahead, Ron.
[01:01:37.826 --> 01:01:44.729]  Hey, I was thinking, man, I was thinking, you know what Trump reminds me of when he pulled it out tonight?
[01:01:45.209 --> 01:01:47.350]  Reminds me of, you ever seen Escape from New York?
[01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:48.851]  Trump's snake busting.
[01:01:50.631 --> 01:01:57.954]  He goes in there, he kicks ass, you know, he saves the president, the Duke of New York, who is Hillary Clinton,
[01:01:58.826 --> 01:02:00.987]  You know, he ends up kicking his ass.
[01:02:01.007 --> 01:02:02.848]  I mean, he's probably just a badass.
[01:02:02.888 --> 01:02:03.929]  He's straight plus skin.
[01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:05.970]  I mean, that's all there is to it.
[01:02:06.050 --> 01:02:09.152]  He's just, you know, he's the ultimate badass.
[01:02:10.453 --> 01:02:13.515]  So, that's my two cents.
[01:02:15.116 --> 01:02:16.136]  That's my two cents.
[01:02:17.737 --> 01:02:19.638]  But I appreciate the job y'all are doing.
[01:02:19.718 --> 01:02:20.679]  You're doing a great job.
[01:02:36.459 --> 01:02:36.859]  Mike Clinton.
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:42.804]  But they said, you know, basically I was shocked, but you were right.
[01:02:43.224 --> 01:02:46.186]  And I think that this is a good opportunity for us to work together.
[01:02:46.246 --> 01:02:49.629]  You know, we can, we can accept our differences in policy.
[01:02:49.709 --> 01:02:55.313]  We can find common ground that we can move forward on with policy.
[01:02:55.813 --> 01:02:59.016]  And I think that Donald Trump actually gives us a chance to do that.
[01:02:59.056 --> 01:03:00.016]  At least that's what I hope.
[01:03:00.156 --> 01:03:02.438]  You know, obviously we've still got two months left of Obama.
[01:03:02.478 --> 01:03:03.679]  Who knows what he'll try to pull.
[01:03:03.959 --> 01:03:04.740]  That piece of crap.
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:05.340]  Mm-hmm.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:13.123]  But this is a real, again, the brainwashed sheeple are gonna be on Twitter trending, he's not my president, apparently is already happening.
[01:03:13.383 --> 01:03:15.363]  I'm not the president, oh yes he is.
[01:03:15.463 --> 01:03:20.465]  You've got people that are probably in hiding and running away scared and embarrassed like Hillary Clinton.
[01:03:20.725 --> 01:03:30.088]  But real Americans know what happened tonight and real Americans, even if they don't like Donald Trump, see that this is an opportunity to perhaps work together.
[01:03:30.348 --> 01:03:30.388]  Oh!
[01:03:31.609 --> 01:03:36.295]  Oh god, this song gets me every time.
[01:03:50.638 --> 01:03:52.780]  When you're a Hillary Clinton supporter.
[01:04:06.229 --> 01:04:10.331]  Uh, Google, Facebook, all of these social media networks in her pocket.
[01:04:10.371 --> 01:04:15.974]  She had celebrities, you know, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, all these big names coming out shilling for her.
[01:04:15.994 --> 01:04:22.677]  Uh, she was going on the Ellen DeGeneres Show and like pandering and like doing, what's that move?
[01:04:23.057 --> 01:04:24.538]  Owen, you know what the kids do.
[01:04:24.758 --> 01:04:25.379]  The whip nae nae?
[01:04:25.559 --> 01:04:29.641]  Yeah, she was whipping and nae nae-ing on the Ellen DeGeneres Show.
[01:04:30.541 --> 01:04:32.463]  You know, I mean... I do the whip Nene!
[01:04:32.623 --> 01:04:33.283]  The Trump Nene!
[01:04:33.343 --> 01:04:38.908]  She said she had hot sauce in her bag swag to like, pander for the black vote.
[01:04:38.948 --> 01:04:43.372]  I mean, she... And then the people... She did everything and it didn't work!
[01:04:43.392 --> 01:04:46.655]  Alright, we've got this, uh, this is Sky7HD.
[01:04:46.715 --> 01:04:48.556]  Is this in, uh, is this in California, guys?
[01:04:49.277 --> 01:04:51.579]  Oh my... Okay, guys, riots in the streets.
[01:04:52.079 --> 01:04:53.461]  Hey guys, is this in California?
[01:04:53.481 --> 01:04:55.082]  Where's Josh Owens or Michael Zimmerman?
[01:04:55.102 --> 01:04:55.903]  Are they ready to go?
[01:04:56.863 --> 01:04:57.663]  Are they ready to go?
[01:04:57.683 --> 01:04:58.983]  Well, I'm not sure where this is.
[01:04:59.003 --> 01:05:01.584]  Berkeley, California.
[01:05:01.704 --> 01:05:03.124]  Of course it is in California.
[01:05:03.144 --> 01:05:07.025]  Hey, Hillary won California, so I don't know what you're so mad about.
[01:05:07.065 --> 01:05:08.445]  You got the superdelegate.
[01:05:08.486 --> 01:05:10.246]  Nobody stole the election from you.
[01:05:10.586 --> 01:05:11.986]  You got what you wanted.
[01:05:12.006 --> 01:05:14.007]  They tallied your votes before you.
[01:05:14.247 --> 01:05:19.908]  Maybe they're protesting because they voted and California decided in favor of Hillary Clinton.
[01:05:20.128 --> 01:05:27.017]  Another example, another example of the complete hypocrisy and hyperbole of the left.
[01:05:27.318 --> 01:05:32.024]  Do we recall, first of all, Hillary Clinton and Obama say, Trump's a sore loser, Trump's a sore loser.
[01:05:32.044 --> 01:05:34.848]  Then Hillary Clinton scours and runs away when she loses.
[01:05:35.309 --> 01:05:37.572]  They say that, oh, you know, well...
[01:05:38.593 --> 01:05:43.277]  It's a common practice in the United States of America that you hand over power peacefully.
[01:05:43.297 --> 01:05:46.901]  Donald Trump is a threat to that tradition of handing over power peacefully.
[01:05:47.181 --> 01:05:48.403]  Then Trump wins, what happens?
[01:05:48.703 --> 01:05:51.786]  Hillary Clinton supporters are rioting and starting fires in the streets.
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:58.623]  So, I mean, who is still living in this fake reality?
[01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:04.686]  They're going to come out and say again that Trump is a threat, that he has not peacefully acquiesced to.
[01:06:04.946 --> 01:06:05.867]  It's all Trump.
[01:06:06.367 --> 01:06:11.990]  But it's like, these are people, oh my gosh, and they are going to be playing this on a loop.
[01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:13.591]  People are in an uproar.
[01:06:13.671 --> 01:06:16.432]  They're so upset that Donald Trump is winning.
[01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:17.753]  They're taking to the streets.
[01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:19.514]  Oh my God, they're actually marching.
[01:06:20.673 --> 01:06:23.316]  Oh, they're going to be like, this is our 1776.
[01:06:23.416 --> 01:06:24.657]  We're angry.
[01:06:26.259 --> 01:06:30.663]  We're going to kick over some trash cans and set stuff on fire.
[01:06:30.683 --> 01:06:31.644]  So this is interesting.
[01:06:31.884 --> 01:06:33.846]  What are they doing?
[01:06:34.647 --> 01:06:35.467]  That's my question.
[01:06:35.808 --> 01:06:36.829]  What are you doing?
[01:06:36.909 --> 01:06:38.010]  What are you marching for?
[01:06:38.130 --> 01:06:39.131]  What is your movement?
[01:06:39.231 --> 01:06:40.973]  What do you think you're going to accomplish?
[01:06:41.553 --> 01:06:41.913]  Do you?
[01:06:42.073 --> 01:06:43.514]  Let's see if we have anything on Twitter.
[01:06:43.794 --> 01:06:44.195]  You know what?
[01:06:44.235 --> 01:06:44.775]  Here's the thing.
[01:06:45.055 --> 01:06:45.735]  Let me get this.
[01:06:45.996 --> 01:06:50.118]  Maybe we can find... We've got a couple callers that are calling in about martial law.
[01:06:50.158 --> 01:06:50.898]  We'll talk to them.
[01:06:52.099 --> 01:06:57.522]  Maybe we can get someone to call in from California that might have some insight on this or that's even on the streets first hand.
[01:06:57.542 --> 01:06:59.563]  First we protest, not our president.
[01:06:59.703 --> 01:07:00.404]  That's what they're saying.
[01:07:00.444 --> 01:07:00.784]  Let's see.
[01:07:00.824 --> 01:07:01.925]  I don't know who it is yet.
[01:07:02.765 --> 01:07:03.586]  Alright, fine.
[01:07:03.626 --> 01:07:04.286]  Not your president.
[01:07:04.406 --> 01:07:06.007]  Okay, then don't contribute to the country.
[01:07:06.027 --> 01:07:06.747]  I mean, I don't care.
[01:07:06.767 --> 01:07:07.388]  So what are they going to do?
[01:07:07.428 --> 01:07:09.188]  Try and recall the election?
[01:07:09.229 --> 01:07:10.389]  Say it doesn't work?
[01:07:10.629 --> 01:07:12.430]  Is Obama going to come out and say, you know what?
[01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:13.311]  It was rigged.
[01:07:13.331 --> 01:07:15.012]  It was probably the Russians.
[01:07:15.512 --> 01:07:17.093]  I've never heard of a rigged election.
[01:07:17.193 --> 01:07:17.873]  Oh my God.
[01:07:18.073 --> 01:07:23.116]  Can you imagine if Barack Obama actually came out and tried to make the case that this was a rigged election?
[01:07:23.752 --> 01:07:26.935]  I mean, after he sat there and told us there's no way, what does that even mean?
[01:07:26.955 --> 01:07:27.476]  What does that even mean?
[01:07:27.496 --> 01:07:27.976]  What does that even mean?
[01:07:27.996 --> 01:07:38.746]  I've never, I've never heard of a regular... What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what
[01:07:39.793 --> 01:07:46.195]  Hey Barack Obama, President Trump, what do you think about Donald Trump winning the election?
[01:07:46.215 --> 01:07:50.216]  Okie doke.
[01:07:50.436 --> 01:07:51.477]  Okie doke.
[01:07:51.677 --> 01:07:52.117]  Okie doke.
[01:07:54.278 --> 01:07:56.338]  But is he going to try and say it's Russia?
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:05.042]  Alright, I think that's died.
[01:08:05.162 --> 01:08:06.282]  I think that that one's died.
[01:08:06.302 --> 01:08:07.143]  Let's take another call.
[01:08:07.803 --> 01:08:11.726]  Let's go to Jacob in Tennessee who thinks we're going to see martial law.
[01:08:11.746 --> 01:08:12.426]  Go ahead, Jacob.
[01:08:13.346 --> 01:08:14.327]  Hey, can you hear me okay?
[01:08:14.347 --> 01:08:14.967]  Yeah, we got you.
[01:08:15.788 --> 01:08:16.448]  Awesome, good deal.
[01:08:16.949 --> 01:08:21.551]  I just want to ask you a quick question, basically kind of relates to what you guys have been talking through the last couple seconds.
[01:08:21.611 --> 01:08:26.014]  You know, what do you think we'll see between November and January?
[01:08:26.754 --> 01:08:31.577]  And how probable do you think it is that Obama would implement some sort of martial law
[01:08:32.463 --> 01:08:34.654]  In an effort to keep Trump out of the White House.
[01:08:35.029 --> 01:08:35.629]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:37.391]  America's spoken, okay?
[01:08:37.431 --> 01:08:50.239]  So if Obama tries to set forth some sort of martial law policy or to do something to try to suspend the inauguration of Trump or try to maintain power for himself, it's not going to work.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.241]  America's spoken.
[01:08:52.321 --> 01:08:53.081]  Trump won.
[01:08:53.501 --> 01:08:55.042]  He is the populist candidate.
[01:08:55.463 --> 01:09:02.968]  So if he tries to pull something like that, it's going to be met, just like this Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, with utter failure.
[01:09:04.329 --> 01:09:05.670]  Good, yeah.
[01:09:05.771 --> 01:09:16.182]  And another question I had, if he does try to, do you think that he could implement it over a Russian threat or some sort of race war?
[01:09:18.066 --> 01:09:19.927]  Well, we're already seeing that happening.
[01:09:19.967 --> 01:09:22.187]  I mean, that's all they've got at this moment.
[01:09:22.307 --> 01:09:23.308]  That's all they have at this moment.
[01:09:23.328 --> 01:09:25.148]  And they've already built the narrative that Trump's racist.
[01:09:25.368 --> 01:09:25.608]  Right.
[01:09:25.748 --> 01:09:33.851]  That's all they need to say is, mobilizing the streets will not stand for this racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic bigot to be our next president, not my president.
[01:09:34.211 --> 01:09:37.212]  And it's so interesting how this always happens at Berkeley.
[01:09:37.452 --> 01:09:39.172]  So these are like 200 Berkeley students.
[01:09:39.232 --> 01:09:40.113]  Ronald Reagan, too.
[01:09:40.193 --> 01:09:41.293]  It happened to Ronald Reagan.
[01:09:41.853 --> 01:09:54.801]  And Berkeley is like one of the main places where students are taught how to protest and how to go and it's like their rite of passage to go out and protest if they're a student there at Berkeley.
[01:09:55.061 --> 01:09:57.082]  You're always sort of seeing this happen there.
[01:09:57.442 --> 01:10:03.226]  That's why you're always I mean one of my favorite speeches that I actually tweeted out where
[01:10:04.086 --> 01:10:11.049]  The speech made on the Sproul Hall steps about, you know, you've got to fight against the machine and you're the cog.
[01:10:11.109 --> 01:10:15.970]  Sometimes you want to, you fight against that machine and you decide we're not going to take it anymore.
[01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:17.611]  It was a very powerful speech.
[01:10:17.951 --> 01:10:23.193]  And it was kind of like the epicenter of when it all began, when they realized how much power they had.
[01:10:23.213 --> 01:10:26.054]  And now it's been thoroughly co-opted.
[01:10:26.074 --> 01:10:32.316]  And these students are taught to go out and activate and protest
[01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:34.699]  But they're not even having their own thoughts.
[01:10:34.759 --> 01:10:44.912]  They're these college students that are being totally brainwashed and saying, OK, we need you to go out right now and activate in the streets there in California, not our president.
[01:10:45.032 --> 01:10:48.877]  Yeah, and it looks like there's a couple hundred people there protesting.
[01:10:48.897 --> 01:10:49.818]  And this is the funny thing.
[01:10:51.519 --> 01:10:57.583]  These people, these Hillary Clinton voters, whether they're out protesting or hiding at home, that's all they're going to do.
[01:10:57.763 --> 01:11:06.129]  Because they're not going to go out unless they're with other stupid, ignorant, brainwashed sheeple like they are here marching.
[01:11:07.289 --> 01:11:09.491]  They wouldn't go out and do this individually.
[01:11:09.591 --> 01:11:17.176]  Nobody would go into a herd of Donald Trump supporters as a Hillary Clinton supporter and try to stand up for their case like I have done.
[01:11:17.576 --> 01:11:23.340]  They can only do this type of crap when they know they have a bunch of numbers, when they know they're organized.
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:32.106]  All of these little shillbots will go back home and cower in their beds by themselves because they've been defeated.
[01:11:32.586 --> 01:11:40.801]  The only way they feel empowered is when they group together like this and march in the streets, even though it's not going to do anything at all.
[01:11:41.763 --> 01:11:43.145]  That's their feeling of empowerment.
[01:11:43.226 --> 01:11:43.787]  Feeling like...
[01:11:44.744 --> 01:11:50.067]  Together they were screwed, even though they're completely clueless to the reality of the situation.
[01:11:50.087 --> 01:11:52.428]  And apparently they're chanting the, whose streets?
[01:11:52.828 --> 01:11:53.469]  Our streets!
[01:11:53.589 --> 01:11:56.010]  Which is, you know, the chant we always hear.
[01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:58.071]  So yes, it's very programmed.
[01:11:58.411 --> 01:11:59.151]  They're trained.
[01:11:59.372 --> 01:12:01.453]  These are the chants that we hear throughout.
[01:12:01.473 --> 01:12:03.354]  These are not just, these are not sponsored.
[01:12:03.374 --> 01:12:03.914]  Is that live?
[01:12:04.134 --> 01:12:04.654]  Is that live?
[01:12:04.674 --> 01:12:05.615]  Yeah, that's UCLA.
[01:12:06.075 --> 01:12:08.796]  Yeah, these are not spontaneous protests.
[01:12:08.976 --> 01:12:09.417]  Not live?
[01:12:09.497 --> 01:12:09.797]  Okay.
[01:12:09.857 --> 01:12:12.938]  But this is a recent video of UCLA students, I suppose, protesting.
[01:12:12.958 --> 01:12:18.261]  Yeah, they came out about, oh gosh, a woman was actually hit by a car at about 12.15am.
[01:12:18.661 --> 01:12:22.523]  Multiple reports that the driver of the car allegedly tried to flee the scene.
[01:12:23.183 --> 01:12:28.348]  Protesters created a barricade to stop the car, attempted to break the glass of the car.
[01:12:29.049 --> 01:12:37.556]  So this is about 1130 California time, where protesters began marching down the avenue in response to the presidential election results.
[01:12:37.997 --> 01:12:40.579]  But again, this is not spontaneous.
[01:12:40.639 --> 01:12:40.920]  This is...
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:48.205]  These are people who are part of a group, maybe they're on the same Twitter, but they're just like, let's get out there.
[01:12:48.225 --> 01:12:49.646]  We've got a, you know, whose streets?
[01:12:50.226 --> 01:12:50.786]  Our streets!
[01:12:50.886 --> 01:12:53.688]  It's the same chant over and over again.
[01:12:54.409 --> 01:12:56.730]  So there's someone in the crowd leading them.
[01:12:56.750 --> 01:13:01.433]  There's some sort of a student protest leader that's saying we've got to take to the streets.
[01:13:01.453 --> 01:13:03.195]  Probably a Democratic operative.
[01:13:03.735 --> 01:13:04.395]  Absolutely.
[01:13:05.697 --> 01:13:10.580]  You know, and so of course, this is, you know, we live in the United States of America.
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.342]  This is part of their First Amendment right, right here to do this.
[01:13:13.382 --> 01:13:19.606]  So we have to support this as long as they're not going out and rioting and breaking people's windows and hurting, harming people.
[01:13:20.026 --> 01:13:27.010]  They are apparently upset with President Trump, President-elect Donald Trump.
[01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:28.671]  Yeah, no, I agree.
[01:13:28.691 --> 01:13:30.132]  They're more than welcome to protest.
[01:13:30.152 --> 01:13:32.634]  They're more than welcome to walk around the streets all day, all night.
[01:13:33.554 --> 01:13:34.234]  That's their right.
[01:13:34.855 --> 01:13:36.515]  And if that's all they do, then that's fine.
[01:13:36.936 --> 01:13:44.599]  But the moment they start burning or looting or trying to disrupt society, that's when they need to be thrown in the slammer.
[01:13:44.639 --> 01:13:47.540]  Thank you for the call, Jacob, out of Tennessee.
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:50.502]  Let's go to Paul in Florida.
[01:13:50.622 --> 01:13:51.322]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:13:51.342 --> 01:13:55.124]  Hey, what an epic night, what an epic day, what an epic year.
[01:13:56.164 --> 01:14:04.088]  Trump is not only a genius, he's the man of the hour, the man of the day, and he'll be the man of the century, I think, once he becomes President of the United States.
[01:14:04.828 --> 01:14:11.451]  Hats off to you guys for being not only the tip of the spear, but the apex of the new media.
[01:14:12.872 --> 01:14:18.274]  The old media is going to be on the ash heap of history, as Alex has so aptly phrased it.
[01:14:19.235 --> 01:14:24.277]  One of the things I don't think that is given enough credence is
[01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:26.028]  Trump's political genius.
[01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:30.574]  It's not just happenstance that he's in the position he happens to be in.
[01:14:30.594 --> 01:14:36.161]  I was around when Reagan won his epic victory in 1980.
[01:14:36.301 --> 01:14:44.851]  He was 10 points behind in the polls a week before the election and pulled it off, and we thought that was epic at the time.
[01:14:45.558 --> 01:15:03.513]  But what Trump has done is exponentially more significant, because Reagan, you see, got the nomination by being a two-term governor of California, being friendly and on really good terms with the functionaries in the Republican Party, and that's how he got the nomination in 1980.
[01:15:04.114 --> 01:15:09.118]  So he wasn't at odds with the party infrastructure as much as Donald was.
[01:15:10.119 --> 01:15:12.101]  Donald went straight to the people with his case.
[01:15:13.712 --> 01:15:22.797]  And the genius of what he did was that to prevent another Reagan, the Republican establishment came up with the primary system.
[01:15:23.397 --> 01:15:27.219]  And they front-loaded it, you see, with all the caucuses at the beginning.
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:29.841]  And the caucuses are all party functionaries.
[01:15:30.841 --> 01:15:36.224]  So they get all the party hacks, right, to shortstop anybody they didn't want to become a nominee.
[01:15:36.244 --> 01:15:41.447]  So finally, along comes Donald Trump, who has enough money.
[01:15:42.119 --> 01:15:43.459]  Yes, but it goes beyond just his money.
[01:15:43.499 --> 01:15:45.480]  It's the fact that he wasn't a controlled candidate.
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:47.781]  He could go on the podium and say what he wanted to say.
[01:15:47.901 --> 01:15:51.181]  He didn't have big donors that he had to worry about crossing.
[01:15:51.201 --> 01:15:51.982]  He didn't have big money.
[01:15:52.002 --> 01:15:53.182]  Mitt Romney was a billionaire.
[01:16:08.586 --> 01:16:12.809]  So that was the big difference with Donald Trump is he wasn't tied to anyone.
[01:16:12.869 --> 01:16:15.191]  He was only out there speaking to the American people, like you said.
[01:16:15.651 --> 01:16:20.775]  And by the way, I just had this thought go through my head because we were watching MSNBC up there for a second.
[01:16:20.895 --> 01:16:21.995]  What a bunch of jokes they are.
[01:16:22.396 --> 01:16:26.218]  Again, Infowars versus Fox, CNN, and MSNBC.
[01:16:26.438 --> 01:16:27.839]  Who told you Trump was going to win?
[01:16:28.099 --> 01:16:28.520]  We did.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:29.260]  They didn't.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.741]  They're on here and Van Jones has done the same thing.
[01:16:32.841 --> 01:16:37.823]  It just clicked in my head when I was seeing the captioning on that MSNBC segment.
[01:16:39.264 --> 01:16:45.807]  The guy just said that Trump winning goes against every movement in America right now.
[01:16:46.267 --> 01:16:46.607]  No!
[01:16:47.187 --> 01:16:48.828]  That's your movement!
[01:16:49.068 --> 01:16:50.489]  Your fake movement!
[01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:51.990]  That's what this goes against!
[01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:54.070]  Your fake movement!
[01:16:54.271 --> 01:16:56.211]  The real movement is with Trump!
[01:16:56.532 --> 01:16:57.632]  And that's what they still don't understand.
[01:16:57.652 --> 01:16:59.053]  But then he took it one step further.
[01:16:59.093 --> 01:16:59.433]  He said,
[01:17:00.093 --> 01:17:06.640]  This is an illustration of the white people still dominating America.
[01:17:06.941 --> 01:17:08.923]  Van Jones said this hours ago.
[01:17:09.203 --> 01:17:10.224]  So here's the narrative.
[01:17:11.226 --> 01:17:24.050]  Donald Trump's victory equals white supremacy, white establishment, even though I guarantee you he's gotten more of the black vote and Hispanic vote than any other Republican in a long time.
[01:17:24.330 --> 01:17:28.231]  Folks, the only reason Donald Trump won Pennsylvania is because he got the black vote.
[01:17:29.511 --> 01:17:35.233]  The inner city black vote did not go 100% for the Democrats like it normally does.
[01:17:35.813 --> 01:17:39.474]  That's why Donald Trump was able to win Ohio and Pennsylvania and Michigan.
[01:17:40.334 --> 01:17:41.254]  So just remember that.
[01:17:41.374 --> 01:17:43.475]  But this is now, I think, what they're gonna do.
[01:17:44.435 --> 01:17:45.675]  White supremacy wins.
[01:17:45.735 --> 01:17:46.735]  Donald Trump wins.
[01:17:46.975 --> 01:17:47.916]  Racism exists.
[01:17:47.936 --> 01:17:51.556]  The caller before said, you know, what do you think about a race war?
[01:17:51.736 --> 01:17:52.697]  Absolutely!
[01:17:52.797 --> 01:17:56.337]  They haven't been firing us up on those buzzwords for no reason.
[01:17:56.377 --> 01:17:57.998]  Paul, you're making very great points.
[01:17:58.038 --> 01:17:58.398]  Go on.
[01:17:58.518 --> 01:17:59.478]  Yeah, Paul, final words.
[01:18:02.419 --> 01:18:05.519]  We didn't mean to interrupt you there, Paul.
[01:18:06.079 --> 01:18:08.940]  I wanted to go back to something you said earlier, Leigh Ann, and that is that
[01:18:10.656 --> 01:18:22.603]  You were concerned that some supervisors of elections, in particular Democratic jurisdictions, might come up with ballots of votes that they amazingly hadn't counted and change the results.
[01:18:23.103 --> 01:18:24.384]  Well, that's not to be discounted.
[01:18:24.424 --> 01:18:25.845]  That might be happening right now.
[01:18:26.626 --> 01:18:35.711]  And also remember, there's many a pitfall between now and the actual election of Donald Trump as President of the United States.
[01:18:37.185 --> 01:18:40.326]  The Secretaries of State have to verify the election in each state.
[01:18:40.366 --> 01:18:53.269]  Right now, Trump's election as the designated presidential electee is based on projections, okay, by the press.
[01:18:53.770 --> 01:18:59.231]  But the elections won't be certified until the Secretaries of State in each state are so certified.
[01:18:59.251 --> 01:19:06.093]  And then the electors have to be selected, and then the Electoral College has to vote, and the electors are under no obligation to vote.
[01:19:07.652 --> 01:19:09.133]  Well, that's actually a good point.
[01:19:09.153 --> 01:19:14.815]  There were people that were worried about Electoral College voters going against how the actual population voted.
[01:19:14.835 --> 01:19:19.497]  I don't think, I don't, I mean, we have no actual evidence that that's going to happen tonight.
[01:19:19.517 --> 01:19:20.837]  I think this one is already in the books.
[01:19:20.957 --> 01:19:25.859]  No, but there's got to be bird dog because you remember Trump... Well, they're bird dogging on the streets.
[01:19:25.919 --> 01:19:27.120]  They're bird dogging on the streets.
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:27.820]  That's what they do.
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:29.160]  They can't bird dog politically.
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:29.981]  They've already lost.
[01:19:30.001 --> 01:19:30.921]  They already lost the vote.
[01:19:30.941 --> 01:19:32.462]  So all they can do is try to take it to the street.
[01:19:32.782 --> 01:19:34.082]  Thank you for the call, Paul.
[01:19:34.482 --> 01:19:35.883]  All right, we have... Hey, real quick.
[01:19:36.423 --> 01:19:38.124]  I, uh, we got Mark Dice on the phone.
[01:19:39.924 --> 01:19:41.005]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:19:41.285 --> 01:19:49.308]  Sorry, we're not getting any audio here, so... We, uh, have Mark Dice who just called in.
[01:19:49.348 --> 01:19:50.729]  We're gonna try to go to Mark Dice here.
[01:19:51.772 --> 01:19:52.712]  What's up, guys?
[01:19:52.772 --> 01:19:53.913]  Congratulations!
[01:19:54.353 --> 01:19:58.135]  Absolutely American history, global history, really.
[01:19:58.175 --> 01:19:58.755]  Yes, truly.
[01:19:58.895 --> 01:19:59.755]  Quite stunning.
[01:19:59.915 --> 01:20:02.116]  I mean, it couldn't have been done without you guys.
[01:20:02.376 --> 01:20:05.357]  It's just, you guys have been just so critical.
[01:20:05.377 --> 01:20:12.360]  So I had to call up Mark a minute ago, dude, and congratulate him on all the badass videos he's put out, because he's been an integral part of our fight.
[01:20:12.901 --> 01:20:16.122]  You know, we play a lot of the videos, Judge is playing all of his videos.
[01:20:16.262 --> 01:20:18.783]  I called Baked Alaska, the guy who did the MAGA anthem.
[01:20:18.863 --> 01:20:21.204]  I'm calling everybody, General Flynn, all these people.
[01:20:22.273 --> 01:20:27.140]  Mark Dice has been an awesome part of this and I figured, hey man, we gotta get him on the show right now.
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:29.102]  So tell us man, how do you feel right now?
[01:20:30.003 --> 01:20:31.766]  It really feels like a dream, man.
[01:20:31.826 --> 01:20:37.193]  I was a little hesitant to celebrate before Hillary called to, you know, admit that she
[01:20:37.193 --> 01:20:37.693]  We're good to go.
[01:20:59.528 --> 01:21:01.349]  You look at everything that built up to this.
[01:21:01.389 --> 01:21:05.071]  We have Hillary collapsing on 9-11 at Ground Zero.
[01:21:05.371 --> 01:21:08.853]  I mean, we have the Podesta emails showing the spirit cooking.
[01:21:09.654 --> 01:21:21.921]  It's just straight out of this divine intervention to stop what would have been the most wicked, corrupt criminal to ever be the most powerful person on the planet.
[01:21:22.321 --> 01:21:23.882]  And we stopped her.
[01:21:24.002 --> 01:21:25.203]  It really is incredible.
[01:21:25.939 --> 01:21:31.841]  Mark, you know, there are people protesting in California right now saying Trump is not my president.
[01:21:32.201 --> 01:21:35.742]  I think you're going to have some new ammunition for your videos that you do on the street.
[01:21:36.482 --> 01:21:40.803]  Yeah, they're calling for the Cal exit now, the California exit.
[01:21:40.963 --> 01:21:41.343]  Oh boy.
[01:21:41.383 --> 01:21:42.343]  They want us to succeed.
[01:21:42.363 --> 01:21:43.404]  They're the patriots now.
[01:21:45.644 --> 01:21:48.405]  They're saying that they're not Americans, they're Californians.
[01:21:48.525 --> 01:21:51.526]  And the brain dead zombies are going to have their 1776 right now tonight.
[01:21:53.086 --> 01:21:57.728]  Well we're going to try to get Mark out here to Texas and let him do some of his videos here in Austin.
[01:21:58.548 --> 01:22:04.611]  You stay here, we'll let California sink off into zombie land, and we're going to make America great again from here.
[01:22:05.491 --> 01:22:09.512]  It can exit, it can exit right into the Pacific Ocean for all I care.
[01:22:09.652 --> 01:22:15.835]  And I'll tell you what, we could let California have their calxit, and then, you know what, Hillary can be your president!
[01:22:16.941 --> 01:22:27.166]  So we'll let California break away from the Union, and you can have Hillary as your president, and then you'll be a third world nation, and we'll gracefully take you back and build you back up again.
[01:22:27.186 --> 01:22:27.607]  How about that?
[01:22:28.267 --> 01:22:33.529]  Have you guys seen the anchors on CNN and MSNBC almost in tears?
[01:22:33.650 --> 01:22:34.570]  They don't know what to do.
[01:22:34.670 --> 01:22:35.891]  I've seen Rachel Maddow.
[01:22:35.931 --> 01:22:37.872]  She is totally grumpy cat.
[01:22:37.892 --> 01:22:38.252]  She's like,
[01:22:40.154 --> 01:22:42.375]  Whatever happens tonight, we had a great fight.
[01:22:42.435 --> 01:22:45.976]  She's a very long face, Mr. Maddow.
[01:22:46.477 --> 01:22:47.877]  Yes, they are stunned.
[01:22:47.997 --> 01:22:52.179]  Even before it was official, Chris Matthews gasped under his breath.
[01:22:52.259 --> 01:22:54.040]  He's like, Jesus.
[01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:59.702]  As soon as the Electoral College map showed that it was pending to be a Trump victory.
[01:23:00.402 --> 01:23:02.063]  I gasped too, I'm not gonna lie.
[01:23:02.103 --> 01:23:04.304]  I mean, I was like clutching pearls in here.
[01:23:04.324 --> 01:23:10.348]  Like, I just, I couldn't, I wouldn't believe it until Google called it 276 for Trump.
[01:23:10.828 --> 01:23:13.890]  And I was like, Google, who's totally in the can for Hillary Clinton.
[01:23:15.050 --> 01:23:15.911]  If they, you know.
[01:23:17.513 --> 01:23:35.030]  I thought for sure before it became official that they were going to launch some kind of legal battles, they were going to contest, they were going to call for recounts, or I feared that they were going to launch some last minute hack attack to try to adjust the incoming tallies, but here we have it.
[01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:41.236]  I mean, it's just all the attacks that they did, you know, it's like the Bible says, no weapon formed against us.
[01:23:41.676 --> 01:23:43.397]  You're on the rise, Mark Dice!
[01:24:06.468 --> 01:24:11.470]  I checked Twitter, there literally is 10 people who have ever called me alt-right.
[01:24:12.091 --> 01:24:14.832]  So they're calling me a rising alt-right star.
[01:24:14.932 --> 01:24:19.014]  I'm like, 10 people, like Twitter trolls calling me alt-right doesn't even count.
[01:24:19.474 --> 01:24:21.215]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:24:22.555 --> 01:24:31.179]  Well, we're trying to visualize a future because Donald Trump has already blacklisted some people from the mainstream media from following him on the campaign trail.
[01:24:31.259 --> 01:24:32.740]  He doesn't want them anywhere near him.
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:40.024]  We're kind of visualizing a future where, you know, only we are allowed into the press pool there.
[01:24:40.044 --> 01:24:43.866]  We got the White House press access with the President Donald Trump.
[01:24:43.886 --> 01:24:48.288]  I mean, can you even imagine the change this country would have?
[01:24:48.988 --> 01:24:51.029]  If we were sent out... Oh, you're right!
[01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:53.831]  The InfoWars getting White House press credentials.
[01:24:53.951 --> 01:24:55.032]  I mean, it could happen.
[01:24:55.492 --> 01:25:03.798]  You know, I mean, they would hand out press credentials to BuzzFeed and the Huffington compost pile, the Huffington Post.
[01:25:04.338 --> 01:25:04.559]  I mean...
[01:25:05.839 --> 01:25:06.420]  It's amazing.
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:08.781]  Yeah, you guys need to get on that and at least apply.
[01:25:09.021 --> 01:25:11.382]  Mark Dice, Breitbart, Milo Yiannopoulos.
[01:25:11.442 --> 01:25:15.304]  I mean, Paul Joseph Watson, the contrarian polemicist.
[01:25:15.384 --> 01:25:28.091]  And the thing is, Trump will still let all the dumbasses like from Snopes or BuzzFeed in there, but then they won't show up because we'll be there and they'll be so scared that they won't even be able to show up because they're so scared of us.
[01:25:28.391 --> 01:25:34.194]  And the fact that we've broken their brainwashing, broken their fake pseudo-electual intellectual
[01:25:34.634 --> 01:25:36.396]  You know, comments and articles.
[01:25:36.697 --> 01:25:37.878]  But I do want to ask you this, Mark.
[01:25:38.759 --> 01:25:45.748]  What do you make of Hillary Clinton running and hiding instead of speaking at her campaign headquarters tonight?
[01:25:45.788 --> 01:25:48.852]  Instead she runs and hides, doesn't give a conceding speech.
[01:25:49.605 --> 01:25:52.507]  I don't think Grandma had the stamina to wake up.
[01:25:52.547 --> 01:25:53.247]  She had to go to bed.
[01:25:53.267 --> 01:25:55.188]  It was way long past her bedtime.
[01:25:55.268 --> 01:26:16.680]  And so I think that she, I think it's that, but I also think that they perhaps were in denial that through some sort of miracle or some sort of, perhaps if they could, they probably have access to some of the tallies, some ways to manipulate some, at least of those tallies in certain districts.
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:18.340]  Or they're just in denial.
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:25.782]  Or she maybe had to go do some spirit cooking and pray to Satan to hope for a steal by morning.
[01:26:26.342 --> 01:26:35.624]  That was my very first response is that she did not get her shipment of baby's blood and she has had to call off her concession speech and send her crowd away.
[01:26:35.644 --> 01:26:41.085]  I mean this is how I know that I still have a good pure heart is that I actually
[01:26:41.345 --> 01:26:42.526]  I feel empathy for her.
[01:26:42.546 --> 01:26:43.507]  I feel sad.
[01:26:43.527 --> 01:26:48.151]  I mean, she's worked her whole damn life for this, and now she is literally going to crumble into dust.
[01:26:48.631 --> 01:26:51.834]  Everyone was so worried about her, you know, making it through her presidency.
[01:26:51.854 --> 01:26:55.998]  You know, now that this is over for her, like, what else does she have?
[01:26:56.518 --> 01:26:57.219]  Oh, it's very sad.
[01:26:57.932 --> 01:27:02.476]  You know, what are the millennials going to do when now they seem to be sort of coming of age?
[01:27:02.917 --> 01:27:03.697]  I've written them off.
[01:27:03.778 --> 01:27:09.543]  Many of us have written them off as just kind of this lost generation, but perhaps they were just late bloomers.
[01:27:10.083 --> 01:27:12.586]  And now they've learned about the spirit cooking.
[01:27:12.606 --> 01:27:17.250]  They've learned how corrupt and how manipulative the mainstream media is.
[01:27:17.671 --> 01:27:20.193]  What is going to happen when they start to discover
[01:27:20.353 --> 01:27:20.593]  We're good.
[01:27:30.959 --> 01:27:35.443]  The mainstream media has ruined their entire next generation of viewership.
[01:27:35.743 --> 01:27:44.550]  Nobody under the age of 27, 25 is going to ever believe anything that they say ever again.
[01:27:44.570 --> 01:27:56.120]  And that's why they're flocking to InfoWars, which is rivaling major media organizations, while Glenn Beck's The Blaze is basically sinking into bankruptcy.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:28:06.004]  Yeah, we actually had a video of Glenn Beck breaking down and in just a week, two weeks, he's trying to get in good graces again with the left.
[01:28:06.024 --> 01:28:08.565]  Well, he totally failed when he endorsed Ted Cruz.
[01:28:08.605 --> 01:28:10.225]  He made a complete ass of himself.
[01:28:10.506 --> 01:28:11.726]  And said that God told him.
[01:28:11.746 --> 01:28:16.808]  Yeah, anointing Ted Cruz, basically saying he was Jesus and that God told him Ted Cruz was God's candidate.
[01:28:19.429 --> 01:28:23.474]  Literally smashes his face into a bowl of Cheetos.
[01:28:24.115 --> 01:28:25.577]  Never seen anything like that before.
[01:28:26.117 --> 01:28:31.784]  But I think that the real question here is, because again we're joined by Mark Dice, YouTube channel Mark Dice.
[01:28:32.425 --> 01:28:35.689]  I think that the real question here is, we've got two months left of Obama.
[01:28:36.869 --> 01:28:50.256]  You just addressed the situation of all these people that are now going to have this window of opportunity to come into a new understanding of the world, be introduced to new media that's been ignored or discredited before.
[01:28:51.076 --> 01:28:55.679]  Now it's going to be mainstream, I think, if anything.
[01:28:56.179 --> 01:29:01.141]  So I'm curious, you know, Mark, do you think Mark Dice is the future?
[01:29:01.161 --> 01:29:02.722]  Is Infowars the future?
[01:29:02.822 --> 01:29:05.163]  I mean, you talk about these millennials.
[01:29:05.644 --> 01:29:06.064]  I think that
[01:29:07.054 --> 01:29:19.426]  Obama, they're going to have to do something to try to cover this before Trump's inauguration because they cannot let the millennials, who might be late bloomers as you said, become aware of the truth.
[01:29:19.907 --> 01:29:22.490]  Can I just interject right here, breaking news.
[01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:28.676]  We're having reports that CNN is now saying that this is a new world order.
[01:29:31.961 --> 01:29:34.103]  Oh yeah, this is... It's true.
[01:29:34.683 --> 01:29:36.064]  The people over the government.
[01:29:36.104 --> 01:29:37.045]  That's the New World Order.
[01:29:37.065 --> 01:29:38.006]  The New World Order!
[01:29:38.687 --> 01:29:46.634]  Well, maybe we should just grab a hold of that term like the black people did with the N-word and modify it and use it to mean something else.
[01:29:46.654 --> 01:29:47.375]  Empower us, yeah.
[01:29:47.535 --> 01:29:48.416]  I like that, yeah.
[01:29:49.136 --> 01:29:55.983]  I really think that the Illuminati mafia is going to have to find a new country to set their base in.
[01:29:56.003 --> 01:29:58.445]  They're going to have to probably go over to Europe.
[01:29:58.765 --> 01:30:00.487]  We're kicking them out of our country.
[01:30:00.847 --> 01:30:03.550]  We have exposed them on a massive scale.
[01:30:03.850 --> 01:30:07.153]  I mean, you know, this has been an uphill battle for all of us.
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:20.553]  Sort of, we felt like we were just sort of going against this monolithic giant and having, you know, minimal progress, but we just kept coming back and kept coming back.
[01:30:20.953 --> 01:30:22.095]  And look at what it's done.
[01:30:22.115 --> 01:30:27.201]  InfoWars has grown, just especially over the last five years, six years into this.
[01:30:27.817 --> 01:30:48.474]  unstoppable media organization with reporters everywhere, breaking news, great guests, a fantastic platform for growing and up-and-coming media analysts and reporters or just people that are part of a breaking story that can come on and tell it and get it out to the world.
[01:30:49.014 --> 01:30:56.080]  I don't know what they're going to do because even with their mainstream media manipulation, even with the social media manipulation, even with
[01:30:57.007 --> 01:31:14.673]  Shadowbanning users, even with manipulating the top trending topics, even with manipulating the results of the top trending topics, so that even when a hashtag is potentially disastrous, people click on it and it links to certain articles that slant it in to the establishment's favor.
[01:31:15.093 --> 01:31:23.776]  I mean, we, through the grassroots, and using social media, and just from making phone calls, and from going out to dinner, and from just hanging out with people,
[01:31:24.316 --> 01:31:31.741]  We have defeated the most powerful criminal organization in the history of the world, at least in this battle.
[01:31:35.624 --> 01:31:42.709]  I mention that because those are the tactics, you know, shadow banning, censoring, giving false narratives of racism or bigotry.
[01:31:43.229 --> 01:31:50.234]  These are tactics that worked in the old world order, or the new world order, whatever you want to say, the PC nature of this country.
[01:31:50.735 --> 01:31:52.236]  These were tactics that worked
[01:31:53.036 --> 01:31:56.439]  In the old PC culture, I think we're finally breaking that.
[01:31:56.819 --> 01:31:58.601]  These tactics aren't going to work anymore.
[01:31:59.061 --> 01:32:03.125]  If they continue to shadow ban people from the right, it's going to be too obvious now.
[01:32:03.205 --> 01:32:05.166]  It's obvious that they're trying to censor the truth.
[01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:07.849]  They're trying to censor the real populist movement.
[01:32:08.329 --> 01:32:09.930]  So I'm not sure if that's going to work anymore.
[01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:11.452]  I wonder if that stuff is going to stop.
[01:32:12.032 --> 01:32:19.898]  And even more so, just in the last five months, InfoWars has picked up about half a million new subscribers.
[01:32:19.938 --> 01:32:20.859]  The growth is amazing.
[01:32:20.899 --> 01:32:23.361]  Have you experienced the same thing on your YouTube channel, Mark?
[01:32:24.282 --> 01:32:26.604]  In the last two months alone, it's been incredible.
[01:32:26.704 --> 01:32:38.653]  I mean, it's, for my average, and I've been averaging, you know, maybe three million views a month, maybe it'll bump up to five, I think occasionally I would hit ten, but it's like 17 million just in October.
[01:32:40.154 --> 01:32:59.185]  So it's I mean it's almost six times of my my average and the subscribers just keep flowing in it's incredible and you know we have a big responsibility because since we are dedicating our time and this is our job this is our life you know we're we're in a position where
[01:33:00.434 --> 01:33:09.882]  Most people aren't because we all have duties and jobs and responsibilities, but most people can't spend so much time focusing on this.
[01:33:10.262 --> 01:33:18.749]  So when they get done with work or even if they're at work, they need a resource to come to to get the analysis and that's what we're here for.
[01:33:18.909 --> 01:33:20.110]  And so it's amazing.
[01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:47.337]  to be a part of this and to see such a great victory because like I said it's been an uphill battle for so long and it will still continue to be but this is such an unexpected and a blessed victory that I it's just it's I'm glad to be a part of your team and I'm so thankful for all the listeners and we're all just one big resistance family especially as this is unfolded.
[01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:52.282]  And it's amazing, too, because all of the establishment platforms are dying.
[01:33:52.982 --> 01:34:01.787]  Whether it be NFL football or mainstream news, you know, cable television programming, all of those aspects of media are dying.
[01:34:01.847 --> 01:34:02.887]  They're losing viewers.
[01:34:03.367 --> 01:34:04.848]  Mark Dice's channel is growing.
[01:34:05.008 --> 01:34:06.029]  Infowars is growing.
[01:34:06.429 --> 01:34:10.311]  And I think what we're seeing here is that, you know, middle-of-the-road people
[01:34:10.891 --> 01:34:25.355]  Who weren't really engaged either way, not brainwashed, not engaged, whatever you want to say, just middle-of-the-road people completely distracted, blinders on, are starting to kind of see why this Donald Trump movement became so popular.
[01:34:25.555 --> 01:34:30.416]  Now they're seeing it was real, now he wins, and now they're kind of scratching their head like, well, wait a second.
[01:34:31.414 --> 01:34:32.675]  Maybe this was something real.
[01:34:32.715 --> 01:34:33.855]  Maybe this was something cool.
[01:34:33.895 --> 01:34:34.816]  Maybe this was a big deal.
[01:34:34.836 --> 01:34:36.377]  Did I just miss out on this history?
[01:34:36.857 --> 01:34:39.839]  And so now they're sitting here, they're thinking, well, I don't want to miss out again.
[01:34:39.859 --> 01:34:53.127]  And so they're going to these sources that are now growing, that are now blooming, ditching the old establishment sources who basically are the ones responsible for them completely missing this historical movement.
[01:34:54.158 --> 01:34:56.279]  You know, when I was a kid, I was a troublemaker.
[01:34:56.479 --> 01:34:58.341]  I didn't really like to do my homework.
[01:34:58.521 --> 01:35:03.183]  I was more interested in cracking jokes than, you know, following along with what the teacher was saying.
[01:35:03.203 --> 01:35:04.424]  And I hated history class.
[01:35:04.464 --> 01:35:07.326]  I thought it was boring, and I thought, I don't need to learn this.
[01:35:08.287 --> 01:35:15.351]  And of course, as you grow older, you start to realize that you weren't as intelligent as you once thought you were.
[01:35:15.451 --> 01:35:18.993]  And now history has become a big passion of mine.
[01:35:19.213 --> 01:35:21.274]  And then I can realize the importance of it.
[01:35:21.314 --> 01:35:21.615]  And so I think
[01:35:22.495 --> 01:35:38.383]  That we shouldn't write off these younger generations or the people that, you know, myself and others have called zombies and maybe ridiculed a little bit too hard as being totally lost because at one point in time we really all were all lost and so
[01:35:39.084 --> 01:35:54.467]  If I can turn around from really hating history class and thinking that it's pointless and being a total class clown troublemaker to realizing the importance of it and then really almost becoming a teacher of it in some respect, I mean, I think that
[01:35:55.107 --> 01:36:09.533]  Anybody that has opposed the Trump movement can come to see why we're in this movement and what is important and why we should all come together for the greater good and make America great again.
[01:36:10.233 --> 01:36:21.644]  Well, and think about this, too, as you've got people protesting in California, you know, all of these social justice warriors, all their protests, all of their claims of racism, bigotry, all of this stuff.
[01:36:22.304 --> 01:36:27.369]  The only reason why they were able to do this is because they got justified.
[01:36:27.429 --> 01:36:32.554]  They got they got backing from the establishment in the media and in the White House.
[01:36:32.694 --> 01:36:38.158]  From Obama, from CNN, MSNBC, but now they don't have that anymore.
[01:36:38.218 --> 01:36:45.903]  If Donald Trump gets in and in two months the status quo changes, well we're going to be the ones that control the status quo.
[01:36:46.263 --> 01:36:58.851]  Our information, our narrative is going to be the dominant one and they're not going to be able to use the fake, failing, failed now mainstream news and politicians to back them up as justification for their causes.
[01:36:58.911 --> 01:36:59.572]  Will it die?
[01:37:00.615 --> 01:37:08.901]  Yeah, one of my main fears of a Hillary presidency was going to be the clamping down of free speech on social media, and really in reality.
[01:37:08.921 --> 01:37:20.130]  I mean, I fully expected to be indicted on hate speech charges if Hillary Clinton were to win because not only do they have the backing of Hollywood promoting that kind of a culture,
[01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:25.414]  But they would have the backing of the Justice Department and, symbolically, the President of the United States.
[01:37:25.434 --> 01:37:28.236]  So we all would have been in big, big trouble.
[01:37:28.296 --> 01:37:30.117]  Even you guys in Texas, perhaps.
[01:37:30.197 --> 01:37:31.678]  I mean, who knows what would have happened.
[01:37:31.718 --> 01:37:33.540]  So, you know, what are they going to do?
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:37.583]  We are the ones now that have the backing of the President.
[01:37:38.123 --> 01:37:40.645]  The President of the United States, President-elect.
[01:37:41.664 --> 01:37:43.688]  It's a major cultural shift.
[01:37:53.281 --> 01:38:12.475]  The older you get, you sort of see these major cultural shifts and we can talk to our parents and our grandparents and they've seen these tremendous things and we look back on them in history and we sort of can't fully understand how culture was before a major culture shift and a paradigm shift, but I think we're right
[01:38:12.875 --> 01:38:30.853]  Right in the middle of one right now and so we're going to be able to see what it was like on the dark side and now we're kind of coming around to the light so we're finally seeing a massive we're really right in the middle of another tremendous cultural shift and it's fantastic.
[01:38:31.794 --> 01:38:36.338]  And I think again like you just said the shift is I think it's going to be determined in
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:44.144]  Like you said, we've got now Donald Trump who's not going to cater to the social justice warriors.
[01:38:44.785 --> 01:38:48.528]  He's not going to cater to false cries of racism, false cries of oppression.
[01:38:49.088 --> 01:38:52.631]  If there's a real cry and there's some serious issues, I think Donald will address them.
[01:38:53.632 --> 01:39:05.222]  But you know, the Black Lives Matter movements, whether they're justified or not, the people actually out there on the street, for the most of the part, have no clue what they're protesting, no clue about any facts or information.
[01:39:05.842 --> 01:39:08.984]  And I think that that's the culture that we're going to see die.
[01:39:09.325 --> 01:39:12.447]  The hearsay mafia, the brainwashed sheeple.
[01:39:12.467 --> 01:39:16.790]  It might not die, but it will no longer control the narrative.
[01:39:17.010 --> 01:39:22.154]  And the biggest part of it is, right now they feel empowered.
[01:39:22.274 --> 01:39:24.115]  They feel like they control the narrative.
[01:39:24.175 --> 01:39:25.816]  They feel like they have the power.
[01:39:26.617 --> 01:39:27.978]  But it's over.
[01:39:28.098 --> 01:39:28.638]  It's over now.
[01:39:28.678 --> 01:39:29.319]  Yeah, it's done.
[01:39:29.912 --> 01:39:30.072]  Yeah.
[01:39:30.212 --> 01:39:31.873]  You know, and I think you're right.
[01:39:32.053 --> 01:39:33.174]  You articulate it really well.
[01:39:33.194 --> 01:39:36.075]  You're a great asset to the Infowar team over there, Owen.
[01:39:36.696 --> 01:39:49.122]  And to see these angry mobs whipped up on the streets of America based off of a hundred and eighty degree incorrect information is absolutely absurd.
[01:39:49.142 --> 01:39:56.886]  And the president and those in the Justice Department and local sheriffs and police chiefs all should have been
[01:39:56.906 --> 01:39:57.066]  Yes.
[01:40:17.361 --> 01:40:30.227]  These social justice warriors and these social media suckers aren't going to be whipped into a frenzy based off of not even just incorrect information, just flat out lies.
[01:40:31.067 --> 01:40:32.548]  The two biggest heads
[01:40:33.809 --> 01:40:42.818]  Of the Illuminati-establishment, uh, controlled establishment of the United States, in my opinion, were the United States President and the media.
[01:40:43.278 --> 01:40:49.984]  I think we're gonna, obviously, you know, our President-elect Donald Trump is not going to be the same head as Obama.
[01:40:50.004 --> 01:40:51.626]  We've still got two months to get to that point.
[01:40:52.066 --> 01:40:56.330]  But, you know, my next question would be, and I don't even know if we can properly address this issue, but
[01:40:57.171 --> 01:40:58.553]  What's the response from the media?
[01:40:58.693 --> 01:41:01.556]  What does the media look like in two months, three months?
[01:41:02.476 --> 01:41:04.518]  How does CNN still cling to life?
[01:41:04.619 --> 01:41:09.223]  Are they going to still continue to present news as they have for the last couple decades?
[01:41:10.204 --> 01:41:12.847]  Are they going to continue to see their ratings decrease?
[01:41:12.887 --> 01:41:14.108]  Will they finally die?
[01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:20.755]  Mark Dice, what do you think the future of the CNNs and MSNBCs and even Fox Newses of the world is?
[01:41:22.281 --> 01:41:28.011]  You know, they'll continue to limp along, but I think that every day we're seeing them lose, perhaps.
[01:41:29.122 --> 01:41:30.943]  Huge percentages of their viewership.
[01:41:30.983 --> 01:41:50.115]  Now their viewership has been up in recent months because of the election, but when we're in the middle of an election, in between elections, when people aren't really glued to their TVs about the possible next leader of the United States, certain massive changes in the country, their viewership is going to drop.
[01:41:50.155 --> 01:41:52.997]  I mean, before the election cycle really got heated up,
[01:41:53.397 --> 01:41:53.537]  We're
[01:42:10.424 --> 01:42:10.965]  I think so.
[01:42:32.387 --> 01:42:32.507]  Yes.
[01:42:48.511 --> 01:42:48.811]  We're good.
[01:43:03.983 --> 01:43:14.006]  We've seen people like Tomi Lahren pop out of nowhere and go to 3 million Facebook followers in a year, 5 million views per Facebook video.
[01:43:14.026 --> 01:43:16.587]  Of course, she works for Glenn Beck, which is a downside, but you know what?
[01:43:16.827 --> 01:43:18.808]  She's a bigger star than Glenn Beck is anyway.
[01:43:19.648 --> 01:43:27.416]  He lets her do whatever the hell she wants to because she'll just leave and his blaze will just go into the dust.
[01:43:27.776 --> 01:43:37.947]  And so her message is completely contrary to anything and everything that he has to say, but he's letting her still be on the network because the ship would sink if he were to cut her loose.
[01:43:38.635 --> 01:43:45.960]  Right, and the biggest, I think the biggest, you know, aspect of the ratings for the mainstream news came from the drive-by media viewers.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:53.185]  Like you said, you know, they flip on their TV and CNN just happens to be on or, you know, they want a news update so they just flip on the TV.
[01:43:53.586 --> 01:43:55.787]  They're not actually absorbing anything.
[01:43:56.187 --> 01:43:58.369]  They're not actually looking for substance.
[01:43:58.489 --> 01:44:00.811]  It's just, you know, it's very superficial.
[01:44:01.471 --> 01:44:04.693]  It's the drive-by media viewing experience.
[01:44:05.053 --> 01:44:14.920]  And so they take what they see, and then that becomes the reality where people who go to Mark Dice's YouTube channel, they sit down, they say, okay, this is a six-minute video.
[01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:17.881]  For six minutes, I'm absorbing what I'm seeing.
[01:44:18.242 --> 01:44:19.542]  I'm looking for substance.
[01:44:19.602 --> 01:44:20.863]  I'm actually engraved in this.
[01:44:21.063 --> 01:44:24.806]  When people tune in to Alex Jones' radio show, they're looking for substance.
[01:44:24.826 --> 01:44:26.327]  They're absorbing the information.
[01:44:26.347 --> 01:44:29.749]  They're trying to learn something instead of just the drive-by
[01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.690]  We're good to go.
[01:44:52.230 --> 01:45:00.815]  You know, the last stat I saw regarding YouTube, there were 2,000 YouTube channels with over a million subscribers.
[01:45:01.035 --> 01:45:21.466]  Okay, so I don't even have a million subscribers and I have a pretty big fan base and a pretty dedicated fan base and so the fact that there's 2,000 channels that are almost twice the size of mine is astounding considering when I was a kid you had a couple broadcast channels and even a handful of cable channels and so
[01:45:21.966 --> 01:45:32.390]  People's viewership has been fractionalized into Netflix and Hulu and all this on-demand video and YouTube and independent outlets and Infowars.
[01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:37.672]  And so I don't know what these mainstream media outlets are going to do to survive.
[01:45:37.692 --> 01:45:50.398]  They may survive, but they may limp along and they may just sort of fade into obscurity where they have such little influence that they just don't even matter anymore.
[01:45:50.638 --> 01:45:51.118]  I don't know.
[01:45:52.230 --> 01:46:06.281]  And it'll be interesting to see if there's another wave similar to the thing that we've seen happen in the last couple months where now we're going to have another wave of people tuning into InfoWars because we were right and because they were filled by the mainstream news.
[01:46:06.641 --> 01:46:08.023]  But what's next for Mark Dice?
[01:46:08.263 --> 01:46:09.724]  What does Mark Dice do next?
[01:46:09.824 --> 01:46:12.486]  Obviously your man on the street videos are what you're famous for.
[01:46:12.546 --> 01:46:15.649]  You get gold every time you go out there.
[01:46:16.750 --> 01:46:18.513]  What's next for Mark Dice?
[01:46:18.553 --> 01:46:20.777]  What's the next thing on Mark Dice's docket?
[01:46:20.857 --> 01:46:25.386]  How does Mark Dice approach the rest of the time until Donald Trump becomes president?
[01:46:26.513 --> 01:46:28.454]  You know, I think that's a great question.
[01:46:28.474 --> 01:46:33.677]  I've been dedicating my channel specifically to the election for the last probably three, four or five months.
[01:46:34.438 --> 01:46:38.420]  You know, I've kind of gotten away from more of the deeper, darker conspiracies.
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:42.102]  But I've I think I've sort of grown as as an analyst.
[01:46:42.302 --> 01:46:47.245]  And so I'm going to try to be a little more positive, not just so complaining about this and that.
[01:46:47.605 --> 01:46:48.426]  But we're really
[01:46:49.292 --> 01:46:57.356]  I have made almost a full revolution where we are, I think it was Joe Biggs that told me this on the phone, we're now, we are offense now.
[01:46:57.756 --> 01:46:59.417]  You know, we're no longer playing defense.
[01:46:59.457 --> 01:47:00.357]  We have the ball.
[01:47:00.577 --> 01:47:02.138]  You know, we're running for the touchdown.
[01:47:02.198 --> 01:47:13.584]  So I think I want to just continue to present quality content, to continue to show the new viewers who maybe haven't been so far down this rabbit hole to see
[01:47:14.444 --> 01:47:14.905]  I think?
[01:47:34.262 --> 01:47:59.174]  Failure and you know I spoke with Alex earlier today or yesterday I guess now on the show and I was telling him in California after the 1960s we had a huge resurgence of Christianity and it was called the Jesus movement here in Southern California because after the failed experiments of the hippie communes and just doing LSD and dropping out or whatever the phrases tune in drop out whatever whatever it was
[01:47:59.754 --> 01:48:16.335]  That wasn't the path to happiness and so there was a resurgence in interest in spirituality and in Christianity and in conservatism and leaving behind this sort of just worldly, decadent, lawless type of
[01:48:17.015 --> 01:48:18.216]  We're good to go.
[01:48:38.291 --> 01:48:41.315]  Did this election bring you closer to God?
[01:48:41.335 --> 01:48:42.877]  Distance you from God?
[01:48:43.137 --> 01:48:43.898]  Or indifferent?
[01:48:43.978 --> 01:48:47.563]  Me, personally, this election cycle brought me closer to God.
[01:48:47.583 --> 01:48:50.667]  I felt the spirituality you're talking about.
[01:48:50.847 --> 01:48:52.670]  Both aspects, honestly.
[01:48:52.710 --> 01:48:54.292]  The bad and the good.
[01:48:55.253 --> 01:48:56.234]  Good and evil, if you will.
[01:48:56.855 --> 01:49:22.891]  And most callers said that this election cycle brought them closer to God, so perhaps we're actually seeing again what you're talking about, this rise in spirituality that goes beyond just Americanism, but also kind of a newfound humanitarianism where it's actually, it's not the humanitarianism where, oh, we need to stop global warming, or oh, you know, gas is bad, or this, that, or the other thing.
[01:49:23.411 --> 01:49:24.992]  It's a humanitarianism where
[01:49:26.033 --> 01:49:44.100]  We take it upon ourselves, we take pride in the fact that we're contributing to society, we have morals, we have standards, and we're basically not just blind, ignorant, fat, lazy pieces of crap who just float about this country full of entertainment and food.
[01:49:44.580 --> 01:49:49.722]  No, now we actually take pride in what this country does, how the world views it,
[01:49:50.322 --> 01:49:55.825]  I mean, this could truly be the start of another great American renaissance.
[01:49:56.465 --> 01:50:06.610]  But like I said, I guess, Mark, the two months that Obama has left is their final buffer to try to handicap or stymie this movement.
[01:50:08.250 --> 01:50:09.331]  It's going to be interesting.
[01:50:09.971 --> 01:50:15.574]  Like Jesus said, you know, there's really one rule to get into heaven, and that's to love your neighbor as yourself.
[01:50:16.586 --> 01:50:17.987]  And to love God with all your heart.
[01:50:18.067 --> 01:50:24.449]  And hopefully we can get back to a country where we realize that we are all a family.
[01:50:24.829 --> 01:50:34.313]  We're a distant family that has been separated through space and time, but we are all, there's really, you know, no difference between
[01:50:35.271 --> 01:50:47.221]  The person that you're walking past on the street and a member of your family, you just haven't met that stranger that is a part of our family because they've grown up in a different house, in a different city, or in a different state.
[01:50:47.702 --> 01:50:52.606]  And so if we can finally really start to get back to the core principle of Christ,
[01:50:53.326 --> 01:51:05.535]  And to really just treat our neighbor as ourselves, then we can restore America, we can kick the globalists out, they can go and try to infest another country, and we can live in peace.
[01:51:05.695 --> 01:51:06.956]  That's at least my dream.
[01:51:07.878 --> 01:51:18.500]  Now, Mark, you're out there in California, so I would imagine it would be worse for you than it was for me, where I tried to tell people Trump was going to win.
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:21.000]  I tried to tell people what was going on.
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:21.840]  They wouldn't hear it.
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:22.961]  They turned a deaf ear.
[01:51:23.301 --> 01:51:25.661]  Friends and family, I've already gloated.
[01:51:25.761 --> 01:51:28.662]  I've already did the ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, told you so on air.
[01:51:29.282 --> 01:51:32.882]  Mark Dice, do you want to go ahead and bask in this Trump victory at all?
[01:51:34.843 --> 01:51:35.883]  You know, I don't want to...
[01:51:36.821 --> 01:51:39.844]  I don't want to drink the tears of the Hillary supporters.
[01:51:42.025 --> 01:51:49.151]  It feels great to win, but we need to be humble about this and not try to be sore winners.
[01:51:50.212 --> 01:51:52.294]  We know what's right.
[01:51:52.334 --> 01:51:53.375]  We're doing the right thing.
[01:51:54.355 --> 01:52:03.163]  We can't sink to the level of the opponents as they've already been exploding all over social media just thinking that the end of the world is near.
[01:52:03.203 --> 01:52:04.444]  Sort of like the parent.
[01:52:05.264 --> 01:52:13.647]  Uh, to the two-year-old who is crying and kicking and screaming, we just need to sort of grab them by the hand and, you know, convince them that it's gonna be okay.
[01:52:13.667 --> 01:52:14.147]  They're there.
[01:52:14.647 --> 01:52:16.087]  You don't know what you're crying about.
[01:52:16.127 --> 01:52:16.768]  Just come along.
[01:52:16.828 --> 01:52:17.988]  Everything's gonna be just fine.
[01:52:19.268 --> 01:52:20.569]  Mommy knows what's best for you.
[01:52:21.570 --> 01:52:23.011]  Well, yeah, well, here's a hand.
[01:52:23.071 --> 01:52:24.352]  Like, we can be friends still.
[01:52:24.452 --> 01:52:25.693]  I know it's been hard for you.
[01:52:25.713 --> 01:52:26.934]  This is very traumatizing.
[01:52:26.954 --> 01:52:28.975]  But here, try listening to me this time.
[01:52:29.035 --> 01:52:29.856]  I tried to help you before.
[01:52:29.896 --> 01:52:30.756]  Try listening to me this time.
[01:52:31.017 --> 01:52:32.498]  All right, final question from Mark Dice.
[01:52:32.538 --> 01:52:37.301]  Thank you so much for joining us here, 2 a.m., 209 in California, 409 Central Time.
[01:52:37.941 --> 01:52:47.588]  Do you think Amy Schumer, Sam Jackson, all of these celebrities who said they were going to leave the country if Trump wins, do you think they'll leave?
[01:52:49.209 --> 01:52:59.993]  You know, them making those accusations is no different than a two-year-old child telling their parent that they hate them after they took away the entire bag of candy and stopped them from eating it.
[01:53:00.053 --> 01:53:02.394]  You know, they just don't know what they're doing.
[01:53:02.414 --> 01:53:03.234]  They're little children.
[01:53:03.254 --> 01:53:05.055]  They're just acting up in temper tantrums.
[01:53:05.835 --> 01:53:06.996]  It's great to be a part of the show.
[01:53:07.417 --> 01:53:08.698]  I think you guys are doing awesome.
[01:53:08.798 --> 01:53:10.739]  It's fantastic to be a part of the team.
[01:53:11.220 --> 01:53:28.375]  All the listeners, every Trump supporter, I mean, just shake a fellow Trump supporter's hand and thank them for getting out the word and for getting out to vote because we have the greatest victory that we've had in our lifetime and perhaps in recent history.
[01:53:29.485 --> 01:53:30.525]  Could not agree more.
[01:53:30.606 --> 01:53:33.547]  Mark Dice, check out his YouTube channel, Mark Dice.
[01:53:33.587 --> 01:53:34.727]  He's also written books.
[01:53:34.767 --> 01:53:35.768]  You can check out those.
[01:53:36.328 --> 01:53:42.010]  And this is the type of stuff, the books that he writes, Secrets of the Illuminati, Families of the Illuminati, Bloodlines.
[01:53:42.751 --> 01:53:45.392]  That's the stuff that he's really deep, deep research.
[01:53:45.452 --> 01:53:50.314]  He's done in that and he's very educated on that stuff, but obviously covering the election cycle.
[01:53:51.034 --> 01:53:53.856]  Mark, thank you so much and we'll be in touch, brother.
[01:53:53.876 --> 01:53:55.176]  Appreciate it, guys.
[01:53:55.316 --> 01:53:56.457]  Keep up the great work, everybody.
[01:53:57.196 --> 01:54:03.078]  There goes Mark Dice, joining us late on this merry Trumpest Eve.
[01:54:03.118 --> 01:54:05.979]  Hey guys, let's take a break here real quick.
[01:54:06.939 --> 01:54:11.321]  And on the other side of this break, I'm trying to see if there's even anybody back there.
[01:54:11.361 --> 01:54:13.861]  If I'm alone in here, I don't know what's going on, folks.
[01:54:13.881 --> 01:54:15.222]  We got a bit of a skeleton crew.
[01:54:15.262 --> 01:54:16.102]  All night, Owen.
[01:54:16.222 --> 01:54:17.082]  There's Marcos.
[01:54:17.383 --> 01:54:18.403]  All night.
[01:54:18.643 --> 01:54:22.027]  We're going to take a quick break, folks, but as he just said, we're going to be on air all night.
[01:54:22.528 --> 01:54:25.271]  I will personally be live with you until 8 a.m.
[01:54:25.291 --> 01:54:27.493]  in the morning, and then I think it's Rob Dew that comes in.
[01:54:27.553 --> 01:54:28.735]  Is that correct, Rob Dew?
[01:54:29.336 --> 01:54:30.697]  Yep, he comes on at 8 a.m.
[01:54:30.997 --> 01:54:33.761]  Rob Dew comes on to relieve me at 8 a.m.
[01:54:33.781 --> 01:54:34.722]  We're going to take your calls.
[01:54:34.742 --> 01:54:36.244]  He's going to torture me for another couple of hours.
[01:54:36.952 --> 01:54:38.713]  So I'll take your calls till 8 a.m.
[01:54:39.473 --> 01:54:43.934]  Quickly, before we take this break, folks, InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:55:39.925 --> 01:55:44.887]  And people always call in, you know, guests come in here and they love the brain force, folks.
[01:55:45.767 --> 01:55:47.208]  I took some brain force before I went on.
[01:55:47.248 --> 01:55:48.308]  I took brain force last night.
[01:55:48.328 --> 01:55:50.169]  That's how I'm able to do eight hours of radio, but...
[01:55:51.169 --> 01:55:54.791]  I guess we're on YouTube, InfoWars.com, but check out InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:55:55.271 --> 01:55:58.873]  That's how we fund this broadcast.
[01:55:59.073 --> 01:56:00.794]  You are the sponsor.
[01:56:00.834 --> 01:56:03.715]  Just like Donald Trump says, you are the one that can fix this country.
[01:56:04.115 --> 01:56:06.076]  You are the one that builds this broadcast, folks.
[01:56:06.096 --> 01:56:07.897]  So we thank you for your support.
[01:56:07.917 --> 01:56:09.058]  We're going to take a quick break.
[01:56:09.598 --> 01:56:12.119]  When we come back, we will go back out to the phone lines.
[01:56:12.139 --> 01:56:16.942]  We've got callers from Georgia, Texas, all over America, celebrating Trump-esque Eve.
[01:56:17.002 --> 01:56:17.822]  This is Owen Schroer.
[01:56:17.882 --> 01:56:19.663]  I will be right back after these words.
[01:56:30.382 --> 01:56:37.487]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:56:37.867 --> 01:56:51.076]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:56:52.017 --> 01:57:03.250]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[01:57:03.911 --> 01:57:09.877]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[01:57:10.618 --> 01:57:19.007]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[01:57:19.648 --> 01:57:27.857]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[01:57:30.692 --> 01:57:36.854]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:57:37.234 --> 01:57:40.115]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:57:40.455 --> 01:57:45.656]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:57:46.076 --> 01:57:52.038]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:57:52.198 --> 01:57:55.319]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:57:55.459 --> 01:57:56.919]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:57:57.119 --> 01:58:01.282]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:58:01.462 --> 01:58:04.325]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:58:04.405 --> 01:58:05.986]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:58:06.066 --> 01:58:09.249]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:58:09.549 --> 01:58:11.871]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:58:12.131 --> 01:58:13.112]  It's in powder form.
[01:58:13.192 --> 01:58:15.914]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:58:16.074 --> 01:58:17.095]  I take this.
[01:58:17.215 --> 01:58:18.496]  This is the product that I take.
[01:58:18.616 --> 01:58:20.578]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:58:21.398 --> 01:58:23.058]  We fight the Globals, we fight the New World Order.

[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:38.162]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:58:38.642 --> 01:58:46.303]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[01:58:46.563 --> 01:58:48.664]  As President, I will make it clear.
[01:58:49.531 --> 01:58:54.272]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[01:58:54.852 --> 01:59:00.194]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[01:59:00.274 --> 01:59:03.334]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[01:59:03.654 --> 01:59:06.615]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[01:59:06.675 --> 01:59:09.236]  We came, we saw, he died.
[01:59:11.633 --> 01:59:13.655]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[01:59:14.015 --> 01:59:17.259]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[01:59:17.699 --> 01:59:25.587]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[01:59:27.495 --> 01:59:27.975]  The U.S.
[01:59:28.015 --> 01:59:31.638]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[01:59:31.999 --> 01:59:39.604]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[01:59:39.985 --> 01:59:42.326]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[01:59:42.406 --> 01:59:45.549]  Of course not, because she's... There's a really loud noise.
[01:59:45.949 --> 01:59:51.073]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[01:59:51.093 --> 01:59:53.295]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[01:59:57.411 --> 02:00:01.568]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:32.890]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[02:00:33.470 --> 02:00:34.810]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[02:00:35.050 --> 02:00:38.571]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[02:00:38.952 --> 02:00:46.694]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[02:00:46.894 --> 02:00:51.696]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[02:00:51.856 --> 02:00:52.576]  The reality is
[02:00:52.876 --> 02:00:57.341]  It's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[02:00:57.681 --> 02:01:05.209]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[02:01:05.449 --> 02:01:09.854]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[02:01:10.154 --> 02:01:15.916]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes.
[02:01:16.036 --> 02:01:18.996]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[02:01:19.176 --> 02:01:22.477]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[02:01:22.737 --> 02:01:26.398]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:01:26.638 --> 02:01:28.239]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:01:31.938 --> 02:01:35.361]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:01:35.721 --> 02:01:42.825]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:01:43.446 --> 02:01:51.832]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:01:52.092 --> 02:01:56.174]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:01:56.495 --> 02:02:01.178]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[02:02:01.598 --> 02:02:01.958]  I don't know.
[02:02:30.444 --> 02:02:32.866]  They said in October I'd be dead in six months.
[02:02:34.807 --> 02:02:39.150]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[02:02:39.891 --> 02:02:49.258]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[02:02:49.398 --> 02:02:51.559]  We came, we saw, he died.
[02:02:53.737 --> 02:02:58.559]  The intervention led by NATO to topple Gaddafi has led to a failed state.
[02:03:03.341 --> 02:03:10.384]  Maybe Libya was not perfect under Gaddafi, but it had, even if to some extent, a functioning government, one unified country.
[02:03:10.764 --> 02:03:11.925]  It was a sovereign state.
[02:03:13.445 --> 02:03:20.208]  Libya now has two rival governments, a civil war that has left over 4,000 people dead, and its cities are in ruin.
[02:03:20.368 --> 02:03:20.909]  I don't know.
[02:03:21.909 --> 02:03:26.954]  What happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be?
[02:03:27.274 --> 02:03:31.738]  Women are treated discriminated against in all these countries she took money against.
[02:03:32.078 --> 02:03:35.581]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[02:03:35.642 --> 02:03:36.502]  They're mistreated.
[02:03:37.203 --> 02:03:38.564]  She claims to be their champion.
[02:03:38.864 --> 02:03:39.805]  We led ISIS!
[02:03:40.786 --> 02:03:41.787]  Take this position.
[02:03:42.428 --> 02:03:48.293]  It was Hillary Clinton that she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS.
[02:03:48.593 --> 02:04:00.083]  We had this brilliant idea that we were going to come to Pakistan and create a force of Mujahideen, equip them with stinger missiles and everything else to go after the Soviets inside Afghanistan.
[02:04:00.763 --> 02:04:01.924]  And we were successful.
[02:04:01.964 --> 02:04:04.146]  And this really just is so disgusting.
[02:04:04.266 --> 02:04:10.751]  When Vince Foster left his White House office on that July day in 1993, he told his secretary that he would be back.
[02:04:11.512 --> 02:04:15.535]  But the Deputy White House Counsel and boyhood friend of Bill Clinton never returned.
[02:04:15.875 --> 02:04:19.118]  There has been this urgency to end this.
[02:04:19.618 --> 02:04:23.181]  And, you know, historically that makes no sense.
[02:04:23.381 --> 02:04:28.105]  We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California.
[02:04:28.345 --> 02:04:37.794]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[02:04:37.834 --> 02:04:39.596]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[02:04:39.996 --> 02:04:51.427]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results instead of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades.
[02:04:51.707 --> 02:04:56.413]  Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks.
[02:04:56.594 --> 02:04:59.878]  We have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton.
[02:05:00.118 --> 02:05:07.568]  You know, the emails we published show that Hillary Clinton is receiving constant updates about my personal situation.
[02:05:07.708 --> 02:05:13.091]  The latest story was the death of DNC staffer Seth Rich, who was murdered last month in an apparent robbery.
[02:05:13.531 --> 02:05:20.295]  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has hinted that Rich was his source, but has made no further comments about the case.
[02:05:20.635 --> 02:05:22.776]  That murder, we should say, remains unsolved.
[02:05:23.016 --> 02:05:33.202]  He's a 27-year-old, works for the DNC, who was shot in the back, murdered just two weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.
[02:05:33.442 --> 02:05:37.789]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:45.019]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[02:05:55.182 --> 02:06:04.792]  Now we are introducing a new t-shirt, which I think folks need to get, telling the real truth about Bill Clinton, who is a serial rapist and a user of women.
[02:06:04.912 --> 02:06:08.696]  In another case, it's about groping and fondling and touching against a woman's will.
[02:06:08.856 --> 02:06:09.197]  And rape.
[02:06:09.397 --> 02:06:09.777]  And rape.
[02:06:09.837 --> 02:06:14.022]  Bill rapes them physically, and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[02:06:14.062 --> 02:06:14.682]  He's a rapist.
[02:06:15.263 --> 02:06:15.683]  Absolutely.
[02:06:15.704 --> 02:06:16.985]  He's a public figure, he goes straight to hell.
[02:06:17.145 --> 02:06:22.406]  Get your Bill Clinton rape shirt today at Infowarsstore.com or call 1-800-253-3139.
[02:06:22.426 --> 02:06:43.329]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:43.369 --> 02:06:46.470]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[02:06:47.284 --> 02:06:49.144]  And they're also very affordable.
[02:07:11.189 --> 02:07:18.010]  It went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[02:07:18.410 --> 02:07:19.170]  It's a win-win.
[02:07:19.651 --> 02:07:20.671]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:25.712 --> 02:07:26.732]  BrainForce is here.
[02:07:27.252 --> 02:07:29.512]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:07:29.792 --> 02:07:37.614]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:07:38.396 --> 02:07:41.559]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[02:07:41.839 --> 02:07:41.979]  Right?
[02:07:41.999 --> 02:07:44.341]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:07:44.701 --> 02:07:48.244]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:07:48.264 --> 02:07:51.407]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:07:51.907 --> 02:07:56.711]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:07:57.251 --> 02:07:59.073]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[02:07:59.413 --> 02:08:03.836]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:08:04.017 --> 02:08:06.018]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:08:06.639 --> 02:08:08.100]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:08.500]  Exactly.
[02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:12.303]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:08:12.803 --> 02:08:20.068]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:08:20.348 --> 02:08:20.788]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[02:08:25.712 --> 02:08:28.394]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[02:08:28.614 --> 02:08:31.677]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[02:08:32.017 --> 02:08:32.758]  Because it's already here.
[02:08:33.138 --> 02:08:33.799]  It's being announced.
[02:08:34.159 --> 02:08:37.622]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.

[02:08:40.103 --> 02:08:41.665]  A new battleship in the fight.

[02:08:43.026 --> 02:08:43.866]  Available right now.
[02:08:44.127 --> 02:08:45.468]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[02:08:45.928 --> 02:08:48.310]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[02:08:49.030 --> 02:08:49.931]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[02:08:50.492 --> 02:08:53.494]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[02:08:53.994 --> 02:08:54.575]  Take action!
[02:08:55.416 --> 02:08:57.317]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[02:08:57.377 --> 02:08:59.239]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:08:59.339 --> 02:09:02.061]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:09:02.261 --> 02:09:03.082]  Alex Jones.
[02:09:03.162 --> 02:09:05.904]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:09:05.984 --> 02:09:09.186]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:09:09.206 --> 02:09:10.527]  Deeply I think racist.
[02:09:10.627 --> 02:09:12.488]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[02:09:12.588 --> 02:09:14.390]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[02:09:14.410 --> 02:09:18.492]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[02:09:18.512 --> 02:09:19.653]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:09:19.733 --> 02:09:24.637]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:09:30.410 --> 02:09:37.817]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[02:09:38.298 --> 02:09:45.945]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[02:09:46.225 --> 02:09:48.327]  As president, I will make it clear.
[02:09:49.190 --> 02:09:53.935]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[02:09:54.496 --> 02:09:59.862]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[02:09:59.922 --> 02:10:03.005]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[02:10:03.305 --> 02:10:06.129]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[02:10:06.329 --> 02:10:08.892]  We came, we saw, he died.
[02:10:11.272 --> 02:10:13.294]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[02:10:13.674 --> 02:10:17.097]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[02:10:17.337 --> 02:10:25.243]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[02:10:27.156 --> 02:10:27.616]  The U.S.
[02:10:27.656 --> 02:10:31.277]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[02:10:31.638 --> 02:10:39.260]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[02:10:39.620 --> 02:10:41.961]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[02:10:41.981 --> 02:10:45.182]  Of course not, because she's... Look, there's a really loud noise.
[02:10:46.663 --> 02:10:50.704]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[02:10:50.724 --> 02:10:52.945]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[02:10:56.795 --> 02:11:01.216]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.

[02:12:41.909 --> 02:12:42.890]  Welcome back, folks.
[02:12:43.090 --> 02:12:46.773]  Infowars.com slash show.
[02:12:47.173 --> 02:12:51.156]  This is the 52-hour broadcast special, the election special.
[02:12:52.177 --> 02:12:59.663]  Donald J. Trump has been elected the President of the United States.
[02:12:59.703 --> 02:13:02.345]  They are still tabulating the votes on the West Coast.
[02:13:03.445 --> 02:13:10.311]  They're actually still tabulating votes in New Hampshire, which appears like it might actually go for Trump now.
[02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:15.342]  Still tabulating votes in Michigan, Minnesota.
[02:13:15.502 --> 02:13:19.785]  Actually, the gap has now shrunk in Minnesota, but that's almost finished.
[02:13:19.925 --> 02:13:21.406]  Hillary will win by a little bit there.
[02:13:22.566 --> 02:13:29.371]  And now the popular vote, they're predicting, might actually go to Hillary Clinton.
[02:13:29.431 --> 02:13:34.694]  So we'll see if they try to spin that into some sort of way to contest this election.
[02:13:36.397 --> 02:13:43.800]  I don't know, maybe that's something that actually needs to be looked at, the popular vote versus the Electoral College, but not this election.
[02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:46.341]  Donald Trump will be your victor.
[02:13:47.081 --> 02:13:49.762]  He will be inaugurated next year in January.
[02:13:49.962 --> 02:13:55.384]  My, oh my, what a pivotal two months we have ahead of us.
[02:13:55.985 --> 02:13:56.865]  Here's the current map.
[02:13:59.730 --> 02:14:05.694]  Owen Schroer with you, Ashley Beckford, Marcos Morales are helping keep me on the air tonight.
[02:14:05.854 --> 02:14:07.655]  We've got some stuff we're going to cover.
[02:14:09.396 --> 02:14:11.117]  I'm going to respond to Van Jones.
[02:14:11.157 --> 02:14:14.539]  He asked me a question tonight, actually, so we're going to respond to that.
[02:14:15.039 --> 02:14:17.040]  I've got a story that Yahoo just printed.
[02:14:17.101 --> 02:14:18.101]  I'm going to cover that.
[02:14:20.122 --> 02:14:21.183]  I lost my calls here.
[02:14:23.184 --> 02:14:24.225]  What do you guys want to do first?
[02:14:24.245 --> 02:14:25.886]  You want me to go to this Yahoo story first?
[02:14:25.906 --> 02:14:27.107]  You want to go to some calls first?
[02:14:27.127 --> 02:14:28.647]  You want me to respond to Van Jones first?
[02:14:28.667 --> 02:14:29.288]  What do you guys want to do?
[02:14:38.492 --> 02:14:46.800]  Let's go to Levi in Georgia to start off this segment at 4.31 Central Time.
[02:14:46.940 --> 02:14:47.720]  Go ahead, Levi.
[02:14:48.721 --> 02:14:49.522]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:14:50.163 --> 02:14:50.903]  It's going alright.
[02:14:51.824 --> 02:14:52.545]  Going pretty good.
[02:14:54.207 --> 02:14:57.029]  I'm a big fan of the show, Former Marine.
[02:14:58.376 --> 02:15:02.021]  I've been on hold for a while, so I kind of just wrote down some things I wanted to get into.
[02:15:02.081 --> 02:15:03.363]  Sure.
[02:15:03.503 --> 02:15:07.288]  You just mentioned that the popular vote was going to Hillary Clinton.
[02:15:07.328 --> 02:15:08.009]  Did I hear that right?
[02:15:08.029 --> 02:15:09.371]  Mm-hmm.
[02:15:10.430 --> 02:15:17.097]  Okay, so that's kind of a little bit frustrating because, like, my name is Levi Hardy and I sent you guys some stuff.
[02:15:17.217 --> 02:15:19.980]  I sent it through the contact us page on InfoWars.
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.323]  I sent articles, rough drafts.
[02:15:22.743 --> 02:15:31.473]  Specifically, I wanted to get into, I wrote an article and did a video broadcast of the technological panopticon and human aversion to binary philosophy.
[02:15:32.359 --> 02:15:50.148]  Um, it gets into a lot of, like, media manipulation through the use of binary mechanisms, like, you know, how millennials are always stuck in their phone, and they're always, you're kind of in their own world, so like, my truth is my truth, your truth is your truth, it kind of perpetuates that whole, uh, like, combative,
[02:15:51.934 --> 02:15:52.374]  I don't know.
[02:16:12.426 --> 02:16:13.026]  We're good to go.
[02:16:36.499 --> 02:16:39.040]  These boats, however hell they went in, it didn't matter.
[02:16:39.881 --> 02:16:43.823]  But it's interesting, and I'm a little worried about what's going to happen.
[02:16:43.863 --> 02:16:50.966]  Like, I'm still fearful of, like, some assassination attempts, martial law, and possibly an internet shutdown.
[02:16:51.166 --> 02:17:03.092]  And this is going to sound a little ridiculous, but back in 2013, in a college, during a college break, I'd been working on some research into AI.
[02:17:04.540 --> 02:17:05.781]  Uh, and binary programming.
[02:17:06.241 --> 02:17:21.331]  And I was able to, like, uh, I made this algorithm that, you know, a lot of stuff, after I kind of wrote this and put it on Facebook, a lot of stuff in my life kind of went topsy-turvy as far as, uh, you know, military intelligence and, like, being monitored on the ground went.
[02:17:21.951 --> 02:17:29.336]  Um, and so, I, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm a little worried, like, there's this, there's a computer program in place that we're all kind of just adding into.
[02:17:29.376 --> 02:17:32.818]  And, like, you guys are reliant on this panoptic infrastructure just as much as
[02:17:33.749 --> 02:17:35.010]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[02:17:35.030 --> 02:17:36.490]  I think that you raise an interesting point.
[02:17:36.510 --> 02:17:40.772]  Perhaps it could be a serious issue, but, you know,
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:19.134]  If the establishment wants to shut down the internet, or censor people on the internet, or Facebook, or YouTube, or Twitter want to try to censor certain points, or arguments, or opinions... I mean, they would never do that, though, because the data collection... But hold on, though, but here's the thing, but here's the thing.
[02:18:20.115 --> 02:18:28.242]  You know, you could be looking at a situation where under a Donald Trump administration, that sort of stuff is no longer...
[02:18:29.505 --> 02:18:37.867]  Popular, that kind of stuff is no longer what's common or expected and then justified by the government and by the media.
[02:18:38.267 --> 02:18:55.811]  But here's the thing, even if they wanted to do that, even if they wanted to try to censor us on the internet or shut us down on the internet or whatever have you, you know what, as long as I have my country, as long as I'm free, as long as I'm not having to deal with a globalist government cabal,
[02:18:56.612 --> 02:19:00.220]  Trying to crush me and make me a slave and put me into a FEMA camp?
[02:19:00.721 --> 02:19:01.242]  Then you know what?
[02:19:01.302 --> 02:19:03.948]  I think I'll be able to get over not being able to get on Twitter.
[02:19:04.972 --> 02:19:06.973]  Oh yeah, I mean, this is the whole thing about this.
[02:19:07.374 --> 02:19:14.518]  The thing about the data collection is it's been subcontracted to the CIA and the NSA, to Google and Microsoft.
[02:19:14.538 --> 02:19:16.079]  Like, it's a big business, all this data.
[02:19:16.119 --> 02:19:19.161]  So, essentially what the media does is they foment this conflict.
[02:19:19.461 --> 02:19:25.645]  It's based on complete lies, like that whole algorithmic election process saying now that Hillary Clinton got the popular vote.
[02:19:27.170 --> 02:19:27.811]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:19:28.011 --> 02:19:30.433]  It's like their plan B. Yeah, that's actually, yeah, I see what you're saying.
[02:19:30.493 --> 02:19:45.848]  I see what you're saying because now they could be, they could be, I guess, perhaps, this could be the rig, you know, they couldn't rig it to get the result they wanted for Hillary in the Electoral College because of a landslide and because, as Obama said,
[02:19:47.619 --> 02:19:50.301]  You know, this isn't a federally run election.
[02:19:50.341 --> 02:19:52.443]  There are local election boards that run this.
[02:19:53.164 --> 02:20:05.694]  And even though, you know, the electronic voter machines are basically black box voting, even with the fractional magic, a landslide still cannot be beaten.
[02:20:05.994 --> 02:20:07.355]  And I think that's what we witnessed.
[02:20:07.375 --> 02:20:08.936]  But it's an interesting point you make, perhaps.
[02:20:09.997 --> 02:20:12.459]  Maybe this is kind of the last ditch effort
[02:20:13.545 --> 02:20:30.307]  Um, getting enough votes via a rigged system or whatever have you, or who knows, I guess maybe even perhaps making up numbers if that's what you're insinuating, but nonetheless, I think there's going to be backlash whether Hillary Clinton wins the popular vote or not.
[02:20:30.347 --> 02:20:31.369]  We're already seeing that.
[02:20:32.691 --> 02:20:35.773]  But I guess that does give them more fuel to their argument.
[02:20:35.953 --> 02:20:39.815]  It does give them a feather in their cap, if you will.
[02:20:39.835 --> 02:20:41.576]  You know, it's interesting though.
[02:20:41.596 --> 02:20:49.121]  You know, these people that are Hillary supporters or Trump protesters, whatever they may be, that are out there protesting.
[02:20:50.021 --> 02:20:57.564]  My guess is they're, honestly, I'm not trying to insult them, but my guess is they're so stupid or ignorant that they don't even know about the popular vote.
[02:20:57.584 --> 02:20:59.605]  They don't even know about the Electoral College.
[02:21:00.846 --> 02:21:01.866]  They really have no clue.
[02:21:01.966 --> 02:21:05.608]  All they heard was Trump won, and this shattered their reality.
[02:21:05.628 --> 02:21:12.111]  This blows their mind that a racist bigot could win, and so their entire reality's been shattered.
[02:21:12.831 --> 02:21:17.973]  And now they're looking at a situation where they feel like it's so desperate they have to go out and protest.
[02:21:18.013 --> 02:21:19.233]  Thank you for the call, Levi.
[02:21:19.493 --> 02:21:28.516]  And I'm not sure, again, even if they want to try to control the internet or censor social media or whatever have you,
[02:21:31.144 --> 02:21:44.792]  I suppose a privately owned company has every right to do that, so I would say those enterprises will die and be buried because they claim they're for free speech and they're not.
[02:21:44.812 --> 02:21:52.736]  Just like the mainstream media that claims they're not biased, claims they're fair and balanced, they're trying to give you news, they're looking out for you.
[02:21:53.516 --> 02:21:54.297]  Total BS.
[02:21:54.617 --> 02:21:55.437]  They're dying.
[02:21:56.678 --> 02:22:19.008]  So if that's the way these business owners, people that run these companies, if that's the way they decide to go, but we live in America or some semblance of America where we're free to move about and make our own decisions and not have an indoctrinating establishment government controlling us, then those industries will die.
[02:22:20.191 --> 02:22:27.913]  So I'm not really too concerned about that, but again, I think that the issue more is what happens in the next two months.
[02:22:29.329 --> 02:22:32.711]  What is the establishment's response?
[02:22:32.831 --> 02:22:34.713]  What does Barack Obama try to do?
[02:22:35.113 --> 02:22:36.154]  There's going to be something.
[02:22:36.254 --> 02:22:39.396]  Do these protests get bigger, more violent?
[02:22:39.456 --> 02:22:43.138]  Does George Soros start to inject money into this?
[02:22:43.179 --> 02:22:44.339]  Does he start a new group?
[02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:45.940]  Stop the Trump!
[02:22:46.481 --> 02:22:47.541]  You know, I don't know.
[02:22:49.063 --> 02:22:52.245]  There's still two months for them to respond before Trump gets inaugurated.
[02:22:53.419 --> 02:22:56.302]  I don't believe that there'll be an assassination attempt on Donald Trump.
[02:22:56.322 --> 02:22:57.303]  I think that's too obvious.
[02:22:59.985 --> 02:23:05.931]  Marcos was saying that they should just bury him in a bunker for the next two months just to make sure that nothing happens to him.
[02:23:06.711 --> 02:23:07.852]  But a nice one.
[02:23:08.293 --> 02:23:09.554]  A nice bunker.
[02:23:09.654 --> 02:23:11.676]  Big, beautiful, paid for by Mexico.
[02:23:12.316 --> 02:23:13.818]  No, he'll probably pay for that himself.
[02:23:15.319 --> 02:23:18.580]  Do we have that Yahoo story or the Van Jones clip?
[02:23:18.840 --> 02:23:28.464]  I'll just go to the next call and while we have this caller on, I don't have my story in front of me so let's not go to that Yahoo yet, but let's just take another caller.
[02:23:28.524 --> 02:23:31.685]  Let's go to John in Dallas.
[02:23:32.966 --> 02:23:33.726]  Go ahead, John.
[02:23:35.207 --> 02:23:36.167]  Hey guys, how are you?
[02:23:37.694 --> 02:23:38.515]  Well, you know what?
[02:23:38.635 --> 02:23:50.522]  There's a lot of people still up here at the office, video editors, who are just having a good time right now, celebrating, editing the videos that we put out today, and everyone feels the positive energy.
[02:23:50.782 --> 02:23:55.285]  A lot of people can't believe Trump won, but the positive energy is palpable.
[02:23:56.126 --> 02:24:04.311]  Alright guys, I wanted to touch on something that Mark had
[02:24:04.915 --> 02:24:05.715]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:24:05.915 --> 02:24:06.075]  Okay.
[02:24:06.095 --> 02:24:07.816]  This was not just an election.
[02:24:07.856 --> 02:24:09.736]  This was a mandate from God.
[02:24:33.107 --> 02:24:40.092]  I'm not sure if you guys know who King Cyrus was in scripture, but King Cyrus was a leader.
[02:24:40.192 --> 02:24:43.936]  He subdued nations, and he didn't do it by war.
[02:24:43.976 --> 02:24:46.838]  He did it by the financial systems of the nation.
[02:24:47.819 --> 02:24:50.701]  He was ordained by God to come to power.
[02:24:50.761 --> 02:25:01.410]  He's first mentioned in the book of Isaiah, the 45th chapter of Isaiah, which that lines up with Donald Trump.
[02:25:02.657 --> 02:25:14.849]  We just entered into the Biblical Hebrew year, which was 5777, which anybody will tell you that's a wonderful number to be in, and we have scripture.
[02:25:14.889 --> 02:25:17.512]  I want you guys to hear these two scriptures.
[02:25:17.532 --> 02:25:20.716]  The first one is 2 Chronicles 7.14.
[02:25:24.386 --> 02:25:25.887]  Then you go to 2 Chronicles 14, 7.
[02:25:26.107 --> 02:25:27.488]  I want you to listen closely to this.
[02:25:54.671 --> 02:26:05.855]  Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers and gates and bars.
[02:26:06.515 --> 02:26:17.119]  The land is still ours because we have sought the Lord our God and we have sought Him and He has given us peace on every side.
[02:26:17.739 --> 02:26:20.460]  So they built and they prospered.
[02:26:23.419 --> 02:26:28.641]  I don't know if this means anything to you guys, but this was a serious, serious spiritual battle.
[02:26:29.021 --> 02:26:34.443]  We had a presidential candidate last night that had a satanic ceremony on her stage.
[02:26:34.483 --> 02:26:37.023]  That was her closing ceremony.
[02:26:37.343 --> 02:26:37.584]  Yeah.
[02:26:37.784 --> 02:26:46.126]  That was her final, that was her, that was her closing argument to the United States that she was surrendering unto Satan.
[02:26:46.626 --> 02:26:48.227]  I mean, it's just really that simple.
[02:26:49.076 --> 02:26:55.220]  So we need to take what God has given us, this opportunity, and we need to pray for this president.
[02:26:55.280 --> 02:27:00.663]  We can't just lean back on our morals and think that we've won this thing and it's in the bucket.
[02:27:01.123 --> 02:27:03.064]  We need to continually pray.
[02:27:03.124 --> 02:27:13.190]  We're not just going to receive the blessings for this nation, but I will tell you this, King Cyrus changed the financial systems of the world.
[02:27:14.210 --> 02:27:14.610]  Okay?
[02:27:15.111 --> 02:27:17.493]  He rebuilt the Temple in Israel.
[02:27:17.593 --> 02:27:20.355]  It was his mandate by God to do so.
[02:27:21.135 --> 02:27:22.697]  And I'll tell you something else.
[02:27:23.257 --> 02:27:34.145]  Donald Trump, from the date he was born until the first day he enters office, it will have been 70 years, 70 months, and 7 days.
[02:27:34.165 --> 02:27:35.426]  Again, the Hebrew year 777.
[02:27:42.210 --> 02:27:49.737]  We are experiencing a time, it's not just a change, I think Mark or someone said it earlier, this is a change in the age.
[02:27:50.297 --> 02:27:52.119]  We're entering to a new age.
[02:27:52.579 --> 02:27:57.183]  We're entering to a period where the time of the Gentiles is passing.
[02:27:57.824 --> 02:28:00.086]  Now there's going to be a temple built in Israel.
[02:28:00.106 --> 02:28:03.989]  Netanyahu came and visited the UN.
[02:28:04.009 --> 02:28:08.193]  He met with all the world leaders, but Donald Trump invited him to his home.
[02:28:09.514 --> 02:28:23.182]  Well, there's no doubt that Donald Trump represents a massive change, and not just as far as policy, but just as far as a candidate, his background, the things he's said, the things he wants to do.
[02:28:23.202 --> 02:28:34.989]  I think that the difference between Donald Trump and past presidents, or anybody even in the government that we know of, you know, the Harry Reid types,
[02:28:36.766 --> 02:28:39.288]  You know, he wants to actually make good deals.
[02:28:39.809 --> 02:28:42.851]  He wants to leave a legacy.
[02:28:44.372 --> 02:28:46.274]  He doesn't just want to get into office.
[02:28:46.294 --> 02:28:47.275]  I mean, this is what I believe.
[02:28:47.315 --> 02:28:48.376]  I suppose I could be wrong.
[02:28:48.396 --> 02:28:49.016]  We'll find out.
[02:28:50.629 --> 02:28:53.450]  He doesn't just want to get into office and enrich himself.
[02:28:54.190 --> 02:29:00.413]  He doesn't want to get into office and then use that office as a leverage to enrich himself or become more powerful.
[02:29:00.973 --> 02:29:02.273]  He's already done that on his own.
[02:29:02.313 --> 02:29:04.114]  He's already done that in the private sector.
[02:29:04.134 --> 02:29:05.154]  He has nothing to prove.
[02:29:05.174 --> 02:29:06.435]  He has nothing to win.
[02:29:08.335 --> 02:29:18.398]  I really think that he wants to get in, make good deals, and try to make things better, try to build things, try to, you know, make good deals with other countries domestically.
[02:29:18.418 --> 02:29:30.562]  And that is such a difference, such a dynamic difference than what we've been dealing with in this country for so long that I don't even think, you know, I don't even think we know what it's like.
[02:29:30.602 --> 02:29:31.863]  I don't even think we can taste it.
[02:29:32.163 --> 02:29:35.764]  There's this movie, oh man, what is the name of this movie?
[02:29:36.690 --> 02:29:48.119]  Maybe one of you guys back there has seen it, but it's this train, and everyone is stuck on the train, and the whole world is froze, but this train circumnavigates the world, and all the survivors are on this train.
[02:29:48.159 --> 02:29:56.426]  It's been going for 30 years, and there's this guy, they think they're gonna get off the train, and they think they're gonna go eat meat for the first time.
[02:29:57.146 --> 02:30:03.371]  And the guy's on the train, and he's like, man, he's like, I haven't had steak in so long, I don't even remember what it tastes like.
[02:30:04.492 --> 02:30:05.593]  That's what this is like!
[02:30:07.028 --> 02:30:10.671]  We haven't had a president that actually cares about America.
[02:30:11.351 --> 02:30:15.915]  We haven't had a president that actually takes pride in the fact he's the president of America.
[02:30:16.915 --> 02:30:26.362]  All of these past presidents, at least what it feels like to me, have just gotten in there with an agenda, and the biggest deal on them was to get their agenda accomplished.
[02:30:26.442 --> 02:30:30.405]  Whether it was their agenda, their puppeteer's agenda, whoever it may be.
[02:30:30.486 --> 02:30:32.567]  Obama's the most egregious example, obviously.
[02:30:33.508 --> 02:30:36.130]  So, just the fact that
[02:30:37.216 --> 02:30:44.541]  Trump gets in and actually wants to be a president for the people, by the people, is such a dynamic difference.
[02:30:44.601 --> 02:30:51.747]  It's like you haven't had steak in 30 years and you're about to sit down for filet mignon and you just don't even know what it tastes like.
[02:30:51.767 --> 02:30:53.208]  You completely forgot what it tastes like.
[02:30:53.248 --> 02:30:56.050]  So that should be interesting to see how that works out.
[02:30:56.170 --> 02:31:00.093]  And in fact, you know, hopefully there's other world leaders out there
[02:31:01.550 --> 02:31:02.730]  Was it Snowpiercer?
[02:31:03.191 --> 02:31:04.091]  Snowpiercer!
[02:31:04.271 --> 02:31:04.951]  Snowpiercer.
[02:31:04.971 --> 02:31:05.271]  Okay.
[02:31:05.631 --> 02:31:05.892]  Yeah.
[02:31:06.152 --> 02:31:06.592]  Snowpiercer.
[02:31:06.612 --> 02:31:07.612]  Sorry, I had to go back to that.
[02:31:07.932 --> 02:31:08.332]  Thank you.
[02:31:08.492 --> 02:31:10.393]  No, that is... I enjoyed that movie.
[02:31:10.413 --> 02:31:11.013]  It was a good movie.
[02:31:11.433 --> 02:31:16.775]  This is very triggering because there are a lot of vegans out there and, uh, you know, not to... Okay.
[02:31:17.275 --> 02:31:18.076]  Okay.
[02:31:18.536 --> 02:31:20.817]  I like the idea of the meat train.
[02:31:21.177 --> 02:31:22.197]  So, but then how about this?
[02:31:22.297 --> 02:31:23.838]  It's like, it's like the meat train.
[02:31:23.958 --> 02:31:24.158]  Okay.
[02:31:24.798 --> 02:31:31.020]  How about you haven't had broccoli for 30 years and you really like broccoli and then you go and eat broccoli.
[02:31:31.040 --> 02:31:31.781]  Yeah, that's a good one.
[02:31:31.801 --> 02:31:33.281]  You guys are cutting it up after that one.
[02:31:33.301 --> 02:31:34.442]  That was Ashley, by the way.
[02:31:35.262 --> 02:31:46.767]  So, it'll be interesting to see, I think, just having a president that wants to be remembered, wants to leave a legacy, wants the people to look at him and be proud of the deals he made.
[02:31:47.707 --> 02:31:52.309]  Not enrich himself, not travel the world, not go on lavish vacations, but
[02:31:53.340 --> 02:32:01.310]  Make deals that he can, I mean, honestly be arrogant about, be proud of, but then the people look at it and they say, wow, great job, Donald.
[02:32:01.330 --> 02:32:02.031]  Thank you for that.
[02:32:02.091 --> 02:32:02.812]  Whatever it may be.
[02:32:05.015 --> 02:32:11.423]  Now, the guy talked about the spiritual battle and how this was basically a test from God to America.
[02:32:13.118 --> 02:32:18.523]  And that, you know, religious aspect left out of this for a second.
[02:32:19.043 --> 02:32:24.768]  I think that there's truth to that in that this was a challenge to America.
[02:32:25.909 --> 02:32:28.011]  You know, we can talk about this was a challenge from God.
[02:32:28.331 --> 02:32:30.614]  You know, of course you can say that everything's a challenge from God.
[02:32:30.654 --> 02:32:32.815]  But I mean, but think about it like this.
[02:32:32.875 --> 02:32:34.357]  Let's talk about on a worldly level.
[02:32:35.358 --> 02:32:40.062]  The challenge for America was to beat the propaganda.
[02:32:41.328 --> 02:32:51.575]  To completely be able to ignore, sidestep, and defeat the establishment propaganda.
[02:32:51.635 --> 02:32:53.577]  Defeat the lies from the mainstream news.
[02:32:53.657 --> 02:32:57.319]  Defeat the lies from the politicians like Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama.
[02:32:58.881 --> 02:33:03.444]  Defeat the lies from the celebrity mouthpieces of this establishment.
[02:33:04.424 --> 02:33:05.025]  And we did.
[02:33:07.438 --> 02:33:12.679]  Now, it is with a grain of salt that I say that, because it does look like Hillary Clinton will win the popular vote.
[02:33:13.259 --> 02:33:14.320]  But of course she will!
[02:33:15.500 --> 02:33:17.680]  She's got California and New York!
[02:33:19.741 --> 02:33:20.561]  Folks, look at this!
[02:33:21.561 --> 02:33:22.742]  Can we pull up my screen here?
[02:33:24.182 --> 02:33:26.163]  Hillary Clinton beats Donald Trump.
[02:33:26.943 --> 02:33:27.623]  It failed again.
[02:33:28.444 --> 02:33:30.565]  You have to relaunch it.
[02:33:30.686 --> 02:33:31.706]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:33:32.767 --> 02:33:40.552]  Hillary Clinton, right now with 84% of the votes in, this could be where they rigged it, folks.
[02:33:40.772 --> 02:33:42.353]  This could actually be the rig job.
[02:33:42.854 --> 02:33:47.217]  And now that Trump has already won the electoral college,
[02:33:49.158 --> 02:33:54.340]  We're not really paying much attention to them trying to steal votes anymore.
[02:33:54.400 --> 02:33:56.160]  So this could actually be where they rigged it.
[02:33:56.560 --> 02:33:56.940]  I don't know.
[02:33:57.540 --> 02:34:08.303]  Do you really believe that Hillary Clinton has 4.6 million votes to Donald Trump's 2.7 million votes beating Donald Trump?
[02:34:09.084 --> 02:34:11.044]  I guess that's 4.9 million votes.
[02:34:11.824 --> 02:34:17.086]  So Hillary Clinton is beating Donald Trump by 2 million votes in California.
[02:34:19.272 --> 02:34:26.377]  And that's basically what gives her the popular vote, is the brainwashed state of California.
[02:34:26.437 --> 02:34:30.039]  She also won by one and a half million in New York.
[02:34:30.079 --> 02:34:36.863]  So you talk about the two most liberal brainwashed strongholds, New York and California, that's why she wins the popular vote.
[02:34:36.883 --> 02:34:40.586]  If it wasn't for that, she certainly would not win the popular vote.
[02:34:41.926 --> 02:34:45.629]  But those are the most brainwashed areas, we are well aware of that.
[02:34:47.614 --> 02:34:50.216]  So, uh, I'm gonna try to get this screen fixed here.
[02:34:50.236 --> 02:34:54.060]  Let me see if I can get this fixed here, Marcos.
[02:34:54.961 --> 02:34:55.581]  Did I fix it?
[02:34:55.601 --> 02:34:56.282]  I don't even know.
[02:34:58.984 --> 02:34:59.625]  There we go!
[02:34:59.645 --> 02:35:01.406]  Yeah, so... Yay!
[02:35:02.848 --> 02:35:04.049]  Yeah, so here's California.
[02:35:06.803 --> 02:35:07.123]  84% in.
[02:35:07.703 --> 02:35:12.046]  Clinton, 4.9 million.
[02:35:12.786 --> 02:35:15.228]  Trump, 2.7 million.
[02:35:15.288 --> 02:35:21.632]  So that's why Hillary Clinton, if she does win the popular vote, won the popular vote, that and New York.
[02:35:23.593 --> 02:35:24.414]  Quite simply put.
[02:35:25.575 --> 02:35:28.276]  So, I'm not as much bothered by that, I suppose.
[02:35:29.237 --> 02:35:30.898]  But the challenge, again, was to
[02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:39.937]  Prove that we have brains that function at a higher level than a goldfish.
[02:35:41.058 --> 02:35:48.946]  And it's nice to see that at least a large amount of Americans have a brain that functions higher than a goldfish.
[02:35:49.975 --> 02:36:02.908]  And we're able to beat the propaganda, see through the social engineering, see through the lies, and elect Donald Trump even after the character assassination that he went through for the last year and a half.
[02:36:04.787 --> 02:36:14.330]  But I wonder if they're stealing votes in California right now to try to provide the optics that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.
[02:36:15.050 --> 02:36:23.693]  So that's an interesting thing that will be monitored as I will be live with you till 8am, 4.53 right now Central Time, 5.53 on the East Coast.
[02:36:24.753 --> 02:36:30.475]  And out in California where people are protesting, they're also protesting in Oregon now, it is 2.53.
[02:36:32.628 --> 02:36:38.453]  All right, let's go to Amy and Bruce in FEMA Region 5.
[02:36:39.474 --> 02:36:44.518]  Amy and Bruce, welcome to the InfoWars Election 52-hour special broadcast.
[02:36:45.939 --> 02:36:46.579]  Hi, Owen.
[02:36:47.220 --> 02:36:50.903]  We're first-time callers, very long-time listeners.
[02:36:51.864 --> 02:36:56.988]  I just wanted to get, like, a little bit of granola on you for a moment and stuff.
[02:36:57.854 --> 02:37:00.036]  Uh, my wife kind of whooped me up.
[02:37:00.456 --> 02:37:20.213]  I was passed out for a second and stuff, but anyway, I was like texting with my friends earlier and all that good stuff and like, you know, maybe we should try to like, you know, maybe try this tactic with the naysayers of the fucking, oh, ooh, I'm sorry about that.
[02:37:20.633 --> 02:37:26.458]  Anyway, let's try to like, try to like bring the other people that are naysayers and stuff and like say, hey,
[02:37:27.526 --> 02:37:30.648]  How about we try to make America great again?
[02:37:31.408 --> 02:37:35.170]  You know, just from the fact that, like, I was at a job earlier.
[02:37:36.170 --> 02:37:42.994]  Okay, I'm now a Hillary supporter, so I show up to multiple jobs in one day at a time and stuff.
[02:37:43.614 --> 02:37:51.178]  And, like, I have a co-worker saying, you know, he showed me a picture and he's like, oh, this is what you're up against today when you're voting.
[02:37:51.838 --> 02:37:55.800]  So I was like, oh, okay, well, I'm not trying to be a fascist.
[02:37:56.934 --> 02:38:04.257]  Not trying to be against anybody of different lifestyle choices, but I was like, you know, I'm not against you.
[02:38:04.457 --> 02:38:06.097]  I'm not against anyone and stuff.
[02:38:06.397 --> 02:38:10.639]  I just don't want us to be obliterated at nuclear apocalypse.
[02:38:11.239 --> 02:38:17.861]  And that's what I've been telling people when I wear what you pulled up, Owen, that you're awesome.
[02:38:18.561 --> 02:38:22.163]  And I wore my Trump shirt to voting and stuff.
[02:38:22.403 --> 02:38:25.764]  And, you know, I'm like, I don't want all of us to die.
[02:38:26.471 --> 02:38:29.052]  You know, at one nuclear blast.
[02:38:29.732 --> 02:38:53.923]  But anyway, I was just trying to say that, you know, if we can try to bring other people that are, like, against our cause, and I believe strongly in our cause, and I'm still God-struck by the fact that Trump was elected, and all the things that could happen in this time that's coming up right now,
[02:38:54.815 --> 02:38:59.378]  Maybe we could just, like, give them, like, you know, play their game and stuff.
[02:38:59.478 --> 02:39:13.466]  Say, hey, how about you just try to work with us to make America great and not make it just a fallout, apocalyptic type of situation that's going to happen?
[02:39:14.106 --> 02:39:22.431]  Maybe that could help them understand that where we're coming from, that we're not a bunch of fascists.
[02:39:22.891 --> 02:39:23.472]  Yeah.
[02:39:23.512 --> 02:39:24.092]  How about this?
[02:39:24.605 --> 02:39:28.070]  How about I'll let my wife tell you a few things?
[02:39:28.811 --> 02:39:30.113]  I would just like to ask...
[02:39:30.709 --> 02:39:51.494]  Our great President, please, please, if you're not going to put Hillary in jail, because I know that would be a really hard feat to do, if you're not going to do that, then please investigate the Clinton's private pedophile island, investigate that, and shut it down and prosecute those that are in charge.
[02:39:51.574 --> 02:39:55.635]  Those that are running the pedophile ring, including the Comet Pizza store.
[02:39:56.375 --> 02:39:59.958]  And the neighboring place that has the pedophile logo on it?
[02:40:00.478 --> 02:40:02.280]  Shut down these pedophiles.
[02:40:02.580 --> 02:40:03.101]  Please.
[02:40:03.461 --> 02:40:13.008]  Well, we'll have to see about the alleged pedophilia ring going on with the Podesta Brothers and perhaps Clinton and Comet Pizza.
[02:40:13.068 --> 02:40:14.830]  That's, you know, the alleged pedophile ring.
[02:40:14.990 --> 02:40:16.171]  People will need to look into that.
[02:40:16.271 --> 02:40:16.711]  I agree.
[02:40:16.751 --> 02:40:17.972]  There needs to be investigation.
[02:40:18.573 --> 02:40:21.935]  I was hoping Info Warriors would go out there when I was on the air.
[02:40:22.296 --> 02:40:24.918]  I'm telling you, go to Comet Pizza!
[02:40:25.518 --> 02:40:25.818]  Okay?
[02:40:26.359 --> 02:40:27.640]  Take these stories.
[02:40:27.940 --> 02:40:29.201]  Ask them these questions.
[02:40:29.521 --> 02:40:30.182]  Record it.
[02:40:30.923 --> 02:40:31.763]  Yes, you can.
[02:40:31.803 --> 02:40:33.385]  There is nothing illegal about that.
[02:40:33.465 --> 02:40:36.367]  There is no- I'm not saying- You're not accusing them of anything.
[02:40:36.387 --> 02:40:38.849]  You're not- I'm not suggesting you break and enter.
[02:40:39.510 --> 02:40:50.720]  If you're- I mean, if you live in Washington, D.C., okay, and you go to a pizza joint, and you enjoy the pizza joint, and then you see a story, oh my god, alleged pedophilia at a pizza joint,
[02:40:51.340 --> 02:40:52.361]  You're not supposed to react?
[02:40:52.381 --> 02:40:53.521]  You're not supposed to do anything?
[02:40:53.561 --> 02:40:55.102]  This is a natural response.
[02:40:55.142 --> 02:40:58.384]  But again, that's not really Trump's job, to be perfectly honest with you.
[02:40:59.044 --> 02:41:03.306]  The Washington DC Police Department would be the ones in charge of that.
[02:41:03.366 --> 02:41:04.187]  The FBI.
[02:41:05.187 --> 02:41:13.291]  Maybe there's a change, a new turn of leaf in the type of investigations or the people that get investigated under a Trump administration.
[02:41:13.331 --> 02:41:14.212]  We'll see about that.
[02:41:15.772 --> 02:41:17.893]  But, you know, I don't know.
[02:41:17.993 --> 02:41:21.714]  Again, it's very weird stuff with the WikiLeaks emails and the Podestas.
[02:41:21.734 --> 02:41:22.675]  This is all alleged.
[02:41:23.035 --> 02:41:24.535]  People think they've got it figured out.
[02:41:25.256 --> 02:41:40.041]  All these people on social media, I think that, you know, there's, in my opinion, you know, if I was the director of a justice system, whether it be a police department or FBI or something, I would certainly think there would be an investigation warranted there.
[02:41:40.061 --> 02:41:43.002]  And, you know, and the thing to me is,
[02:41:44.983 --> 02:41:46.564]  Maybe they have investigated.
[02:41:46.624 --> 02:41:46.965]  I don't know.
[02:41:47.005 --> 02:41:48.246]  They haven't said anything to me.
[02:41:48.326 --> 02:41:50.047]  James Comey hasn't said anything to me.
[02:41:50.087 --> 02:41:51.168]  This is a pretty big deal.
[02:41:51.228 --> 02:41:54.830]  They talk about how they look into Hillary Clinton's emails, right?
[02:41:54.891 --> 02:42:05.158]  I mean, that's what James Comey's been doing, investigating Hillary Clinton's emails, scanning to see what documents went through, whether they were classified or not.
[02:42:05.238 --> 02:42:07.940]  Of course, he found out that they were classified.
[02:42:07.960 --> 02:42:09.522]  Hillary Clinton completely lied about that.
[02:42:10.522 --> 02:42:15.305]  But nonetheless, in the emails is where we found this weird stuff.
[02:42:16.186 --> 02:42:20.409]  So, does the FBI look into it the same way that the citizens have looked into it?
[02:42:20.529 --> 02:42:21.029]  I don't know.
[02:42:22.390 --> 02:42:23.711]  What's going on at Comet Pizza?
[02:42:23.791 --> 02:42:25.172]  Obviously, I have no idea.
[02:42:25.272 --> 02:42:26.693]  I'm not in Washington, D.C.
[02:42:26.833 --> 02:42:27.654]  I've never been there.
[02:42:28.294 --> 02:42:34.398]  But I'm telling you, if I was, again, I would print out these stories and I would say, hey, what's going on here?
[02:42:34.418 --> 02:42:39.522]  And then you can probably get a good idea based on the response if there's anything going on.
[02:42:40.422 --> 02:42:41.463]  But this is all alleged.
[02:42:41.583 --> 02:42:42.343]  I have no idea.
[02:42:42.423 --> 02:42:43.724]  I don't know if there's an investigation.
[02:42:43.884 --> 02:42:55.331]  I don't know what the Podestas are involved in in their free time other than weird art with weird images of children and the way Jeffrey Dahmer would twist dead bodies.
[02:42:55.351 --> 02:42:56.731]  You know, he can be into that, fine.
[02:42:56.751 --> 02:42:57.652]  You're a freak show.
[02:42:57.972 --> 02:42:58.392]  Whatever.
[02:42:58.472 --> 02:42:59.553]  You're into that kind of crap.
[02:43:00.213 --> 02:43:00.994]  That's none of my business.
[02:43:01.014 --> 02:43:01.954]  That's not against the law.
[02:43:02.655 --> 02:43:05.957]  But obviously, there are alleged activities people think that need to be investigated.
[02:43:06.960 --> 02:43:07.480]  But we'll see.
[02:43:07.961 --> 02:43:09.302]  We'll see if any of that falls through.
[02:43:09.342 --> 02:43:10.743]  We'll see if the FBI does anything.
[02:43:11.563 --> 02:43:28.014]  And we'll see if there's a change of the guard when Trump becomes president as far as the audacity or the transparency that these agencies have to actually look in to people from the establishment like Hillary Clinton.
[02:43:29.434 --> 02:43:41.077]  Of course, but it's the Clintons who have been working hand-in-hand with people like the Podestas, like Mark Rich, in order to maintain their criminal empire.
[02:43:41.457 --> 02:43:43.698]  So, but could it all come to an end with Trump?
[02:43:43.738 --> 02:43:46.439]  I think that that's more the question than anything.
[02:43:47.642 --> 02:44:02.093]  To me, outside of alleged pedophiliaring or whatever else is going on, if Trump gets in, we might actually have a leader that is willing to let these departments do their job
[02:44:02.893 --> 02:44:12.858]  Instead of, you know, looking around, constantly trying to be in control, have cronies in all these positions because they have to maintain their corrupt power structure.
[02:44:12.878 --> 02:44:14.338]  So that could be a big difference.
[02:44:15.439 --> 02:44:18.900]  And you know, you talked about Hillary Clinton going to jail when Trump put her in jail.
[02:44:20.301 --> 02:44:22.462]  You know, Hillary didn't do a concession speech tonight.
[02:44:23.908 --> 02:44:26.089]  She abandoned all of her followers.
[02:44:26.649 --> 02:44:27.630]  That's what she thinks of you.
[02:44:27.730 --> 02:44:32.212]  She took a big fat crap on you right before she lost the election.
[02:44:32.352 --> 02:44:34.092]  That's the true nature of Hillary Clinton.
[02:44:36.474 --> 02:44:39.455]  But, you know, she called Donald Trump apparently for her concession.
[02:44:39.555 --> 02:44:41.556]  She called Donald Trump and conceded on the phone.
[02:44:41.576 --> 02:44:45.858]  I have a feeling that that conversation went a lot like this.
[02:44:47.999 --> 02:44:51.060]  Donald, please don't send me to jail.
[02:44:52.403 --> 02:44:54.283]  Please don't send me to jail, Donald.
[02:44:54.363 --> 02:44:55.044]  I'm sorry.
[02:44:55.864 --> 02:44:56.624]  I'll back off.
[02:44:57.324 --> 02:44:58.684]  I won't say the Russians rigged it.
[02:44:59.645 --> 02:45:01.065]  I won't say the election is rigged.
[02:45:01.145 --> 02:45:02.205]  I'll concede right now.
[02:45:02.265 --> 02:45:03.805]  Just please don't send me to jail.
[02:45:04.165 --> 02:45:04.486]  Please.
[02:45:05.266 --> 02:45:06.566]  Please don't look into my emails.
[02:45:06.606 --> 02:45:08.106]  Please don't send me to jail, Donald.
[02:45:08.226 --> 02:45:08.826]  Oh my God.
[02:45:09.147 --> 02:45:09.587]  You won.
[02:45:09.767 --> 02:45:10.487]  You won, Donald.
[02:45:10.507 --> 02:45:11.587]  Just don't send me to jail.
[02:45:13.547 --> 02:45:15.348]  I have a feeling that that's how that phone call went.
[02:45:16.208 --> 02:45:16.668]  But I don't know.
[02:45:17.328 --> 02:45:17.968]  That's just me.
[02:45:18.789 --> 02:45:20.789]  Do we have that Van Jones clip ready to go, guys?
[02:45:25.411 --> 02:45:26.392]  Sorry, what was that, Captain?
[02:45:27.432 --> 02:45:29.974]  Let's go to that Van Jones clip.
[02:45:30.554 --> 02:45:33.056]  Van Jones asked me a question earlier.
[02:45:33.076 --> 02:45:34.657]  He really wants to know about this.
[02:45:34.697 --> 02:45:35.958]  Now, me and Van are friends.
[02:45:36.498 --> 02:45:42.862]  You've probably seen the video of me and Van deliberating on the street, if you will.
[02:45:43.402 --> 02:45:45.363]  This is probably a rough night for Van Jones.
[02:45:45.424 --> 02:45:49.586]  He couldn't believe that the racist bigot Donald Trump could ever win office.
[02:45:49.626 --> 02:45:50.667]  He's the biggest racist ever.
[02:45:51.187 --> 02:45:51.987]  He actually said that.
[02:45:52.027 --> 02:45:54.068]  He said he thinks he's worse than a racist.
[02:45:54.709 --> 02:45:55.849]  He said that when I was talking.
[02:45:55.869 --> 02:45:57.490]  He said Donald Trump is worse than a racist.
[02:45:57.970 --> 02:45:58.710]  Whatever, Van.
[02:45:59.390 --> 02:46:02.892]  But here's the question that Van Jones wants me to answer.
[02:46:02.972 --> 02:46:04.172]  Go ahead and roll Van Jones.
[02:46:07.814 --> 02:46:08.894]  Hey guys, I can't hear him.
[02:46:08.934 --> 02:46:11.075]  Tell your kids, don't be a bully.
[02:46:12.076 --> 02:46:13.336]  Hey, can we restart that please?
[02:46:13.837 --> 02:46:14.957]  Let's restart that real quick.
[02:46:15.597 --> 02:46:16.818]  Tell your kids, do your homework.
[02:46:17.705 --> 02:46:18.786]  You know, it's funny to me.
[02:46:19.266 --> 02:46:20.226]  Yeah, I could hear that.
[02:46:20.246 --> 02:46:22.447]  It's funny to me that... Alright, just go ahead and roll it.
[02:46:22.467 --> 02:46:23.248]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:46:23.388 --> 02:46:25.369]  It's hard to be a parent tonight for a lot of us.
[02:46:26.249 --> 02:46:28.530]  You tell your kids, don't be a bully.
[02:46:29.851 --> 02:46:31.331]  You tell your kids, don't be a bully.
[02:46:31.351 --> 02:46:31.932]  Alright, stop it.
[02:46:31.972 --> 02:46:32.392]  Just stop it.
[02:46:32.412 --> 02:46:32.772]  Just stop it.
[02:46:32.892 --> 02:46:33.432]  It's alright, folks.
[02:46:33.452 --> 02:46:34.513]  It's 5 o'clock central.
[02:46:35.153 --> 02:46:35.914]  And be prepared.
[02:46:36.874 --> 02:46:37.894]  And then you have this outcome.
[02:46:37.935 --> 02:46:40.256]  And you have people putting children to bed tonight.
[02:46:40.676 --> 02:46:41.796]  Alright.
[02:46:41.836 --> 02:46:42.917]  They're afraid of breakfast.
[02:46:43.933 --> 02:46:46.474]  You're afraid of- how do I explain this to my children?
[02:46:46.754 --> 02:46:51.496]  I have Muslim friends who are texting me tonight saying, should I leave the country?
[02:46:51.516 --> 02:46:53.016]  I have- PAUSE IT!
[02:46:53.056 --> 02:46:53.697]  PAUSE IT RIGHT THERE!
[02:46:53.757 --> 02:46:54.357]  PAUSE IT RIGHT THERE!
[02:46:54.417 --> 02:46:55.017]  PAUSE IT RIGHT THERE!
[02:46:55.417 --> 02:46:57.098]  Okay, see, this is exactly what I'm talking about.
[02:46:59.919 --> 02:47:02.080]  See, I mean, I just- the brainwashing!
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:12.104]  It's- it's- it's- it's- It's literally buying in to propaganda so much so that
[02:47:13.132 --> 02:47:30.743]  It affects your reality where you're living in such a delusionment that you really think, you're really afraid that Donald Trump being president means you're going to somehow be deported.
[02:47:30.783 --> 02:47:33.345]  We've had people say he's going to send black people back to Africa.
[02:47:33.925 --> 02:47:36.867]  The most asinine beliefs, the most asinine things.
[02:47:37.427 --> 02:47:37.748]  Folks!
[02:47:39.429 --> 02:47:42.791]  All Donald Trump wants to do is secure the border.
[02:47:44.052 --> 02:47:49.475]  Now, the reason why it's hard for people to understand this is because they don't understand that the border is wide open.
[02:47:49.515 --> 02:47:51.016]  They really don't get it.
[02:47:51.496 --> 02:47:53.337]  They really don't understand that concept.
[02:47:53.357 --> 02:47:55.899]  They're either not paying attention or they think it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:47:55.959 --> 02:47:56.919]  No, the border is wide open.
[02:47:57.600 --> 02:47:59.301]  All Donald wants to do is secure the border.
[02:47:59.921 --> 02:48:03.543]  And then Van Jones says, what am I supposed to say to my Muslim friends?
[02:48:04.404 --> 02:48:05.945]  Well, are they American citizens, Van?
[02:48:07.287 --> 02:48:07.587]  Yes?
[02:48:08.428 --> 02:48:09.208]  Then nothing!
[02:48:10.209 --> 02:48:12.130]  You don't have to say anything!
[02:48:12.571 --> 02:48:13.952]  Because they're Americans!
[02:48:14.292 --> 02:48:15.653]  They're not going anywhere!
[02:48:16.013 --> 02:48:17.554]  They're not gonna be deported!
[02:48:17.894 --> 02:48:19.415]  They are American citizens!
[02:48:19.495 --> 02:48:23.138]  Why is this so hard for some people to grasp?
[02:48:24.038 --> 02:48:25.880]  Like I said earlier, I have a friend from Canada.
[02:48:25.900 --> 02:48:30.022]  Now maybe she was joking, but she was like, oh my god, Trump won, I'm gonna be deported.
[02:48:30.042 --> 02:48:31.463]  I'm like laughing, like what?
[02:48:32.824 --> 02:48:33.745]  You're here legally!
[02:48:36.064 --> 02:48:37.686]  All Donald wants to do is secure the border.
[02:48:38.867 --> 02:48:42.030]  He wants a very stingent vetting process for refugees.
[02:48:42.370 --> 02:48:45.533]  In fact, I think that this is a plan that makes even more sense.
[02:48:46.434 --> 02:48:52.840]  Instead of bringing all of these refugees here, paying for all of them, trying to reshape our culture,
[02:48:55.031 --> 02:49:00.277]  Why not just set up safe zones that all these countries can help pay for?
[02:49:00.898 --> 02:49:06.624]  Instead of bringing all these people into Europe that has destroyed their culture and their countries, we create safe zones.
[02:49:06.784 --> 02:49:14.433]  Of course, you know, this whole thing is so convoluted because we're at the very base of it dealing with
[02:49:15.942 --> 02:49:33.656]  There's wars that are being fought for reasons that we probably still can't fully comprehend, a lot of lies, a lot of political reasons, banking reasons why these wars are fought, religious reasons as well if you talk about the Middle East, but why are we even sticking our noses in it?
[02:49:33.736 --> 02:49:36.838]  You know, that's the question you've got to think about to begin with.
[02:49:37.339 --> 02:49:44.925]  So there's this whole weird convoluted thing going on with these wars where sure, we're responsible, we share the responsibility.
[02:49:46.610 --> 02:49:55.194]  But that doesn't mean that now we should just basically punish ourselves by wrecking our own country and our own culture.
[02:49:55.234 --> 02:49:57.815]  No, why don't we try to fix what's going on over there?
[02:49:58.715 --> 02:50:00.976]  So again, that's what Donald Trump wants.
[02:50:01.016 --> 02:50:02.977]  He doesn't want to ban Muslims.
[02:50:03.377 --> 02:50:13.402]  He wants to fix the problems we have in Muslim regions, and then he wants to deter the element of radical Islam that comes here
[02:50:14.462 --> 02:50:17.563]  And wants to destroy our culture and kills innocent people.
[02:50:18.883 --> 02:50:21.043]  But Van Jones, I just don't get it.
[02:50:21.203 --> 02:50:27.024]  I'm sorry folks, people get triggered by this word, but is Van Jones retarded?
[02:50:29.725 --> 02:50:38.566]  Look, the word retarded means you have a brain that doesn't function fully.
[02:50:39.246 --> 02:50:42.867]  It's retarded, it's shortened, it's weak, it's smaller.
[02:50:43.829 --> 02:50:45.730]  I mean, so that's what I'm saying.
[02:50:45.790 --> 02:50:46.930]  Is Van Jones retarded?
[02:50:46.990 --> 02:50:51.492]  He doesn't understand that Donald Trump isn't going to deport Muslims?
[02:50:53.192 --> 02:51:02.235]  Now, if a Muslim is here illegally and tries to commit an act of terror, yeah, your ass is gone!
[02:51:03.156 --> 02:51:03.876]  No doubt!
[02:51:05.196 --> 02:51:06.857]  But if you're an American citizen,
[02:51:08.072 --> 02:51:09.212]  That is Muslim?
[02:51:10.053 --> 02:51:10.913]  You're fine!
[02:51:11.373 --> 02:51:12.413]  Don't break the law!
[02:51:12.613 --> 02:51:14.814]  It's not that hard to understand.
[02:51:14.874 --> 02:51:16.394]  Why doesn't Van Jones get it?
[02:51:17.754 --> 02:51:19.255]  And then what is wrong with Van Jones?
[02:51:19.755 --> 02:51:21.515]  How do I explain this to my kids?
[02:51:23.776 --> 02:51:26.237]  What are you trying to explain to your kids exactly, Van?
[02:51:26.937 --> 02:51:28.817]  What is it that you're going to explain to your kids?
[02:51:29.297 --> 02:51:31.378]  Are you... Here's what Van is going to do, folks.
[02:51:32.605 --> 02:51:37.588]  He's going to perpetuate this false narrative that Donald Trump's a bigot.
[02:51:38.148 --> 02:51:41.390]  He's going to perpetuate this false narrative that Donald Trump's a racist.
[02:51:41.810 --> 02:51:47.773]  He's going to perpetuate this false narrative that Donald Trump wants to import anybody or deport anybody who's not white.
[02:51:48.494 --> 02:51:53.056]  He's going to perpetuate this false narrative that Donald Trump is the most evil man since Hitler.
[02:51:54.397 --> 02:52:01.741]  So even though we've defeated this, we the American people have defeated this, we defeated him, his train of thought has failed.
[02:52:02.839 --> 02:52:18.174]  In real time, in reality, it's failed, but he's still going to stick on this, he's still going to perpetuate these false narratives, and then he's going to have to sit here and he's going to bury himself in his own fake reality.
[02:52:19.776 --> 02:52:20.636]  And so what happens?
[02:52:21.724 --> 02:52:39.944]  His fake reality has failed, but he can't accept it, so he's going to bury himself in the fake reality, smothering himself in it, and then he's looking in the mirror asking himself, how do I explain this to the children?
[02:52:39.964 --> 02:52:43.247]  How do I explain this to my Muslim friends?
[02:52:44.517 --> 02:53:06.791]  So again, completely baseless, completely outside of any realm of logical thought, he takes his false reality, he puts a veil over himself, and then he wants to perpetuate this in his own life and tries to figure out how he's going to explain this to his children, folks.
[02:53:07.652 --> 02:53:08.673]  Again, explain what?
[02:53:09.733 --> 02:53:10.394]  Explain what?
[02:53:11.892 --> 02:53:17.804]  In fact, here you go, we'll finish the clip, but Van, Van, I'll explain it to you very simply, my friend.
[02:53:17.824 --> 02:53:18.867]  You're wrong.
[02:53:20.626 --> 02:53:21.867]  Trump's not racist.
[02:53:22.427 --> 02:53:23.708]  He doesn't hate women.
[02:53:24.469 --> 02:53:26.710]  He doesn't want to deport Mexicans.
[02:53:28.011 --> 02:53:31.213]  He wants to return law and order.
[02:53:31.573 --> 02:53:38.698]  He wants to get rid of all these political agendas that cause us to ignore law in certain aspects of life and our culture.
[02:53:39.098 --> 02:53:42.341]  And he wants to bring back logic and common sense, which you lack!
[02:53:42.921 --> 02:53:44.282]  That's all it is, Van Jones!
[02:53:44.562 --> 02:53:46.003]  The return of common sense!
[02:53:46.283 --> 02:53:47.444]  The return of logic!
[02:53:47.724 --> 02:53:52.327]  You want to explain to your kids what happened on November 8th, 2016?
[02:53:52.647 --> 02:53:54.628]  You tell them that logic returned!
[02:53:54.828 --> 02:53:56.689]  You tell them that common sense returned!
[02:53:56.909 --> 02:54:01.452]  You tell them that the American people decided they didn't want to vote in a criminal!
[02:54:01.952 --> 02:54:03.413]  That's what you tell them, Van!
[02:54:03.433 --> 02:54:03.853]  But you...
[02:54:05.094 --> 02:54:11.176]  You want to perpetuate the false narratives because you're so arrogant that you can't admit you failed.
[02:54:11.476 --> 02:54:23.781]  You tried to force these false narratives on the entire American people and you failed, but because you're so prideful, you're going to continue to live in this false reality, and then you're going to push it on your kids and friends.
[02:54:23.801 --> 02:54:25.861]  So, there you go, Van.
[02:54:25.881 --> 02:54:29.783]  I just told you what to explain, how to explain this to your kids.
[02:54:30.743 --> 02:54:32.784]  Americanism has defeated globalism.
[02:54:33.704 --> 02:54:36.546]  Reality has defeated propaganda.
[02:54:38.447 --> 02:54:47.372]  And America decided they didn't want to elect a known criminal who is allegedly involved in pedophile rings.
[02:54:48.272 --> 02:54:48.592]  Okay?
[02:54:48.852 --> 02:54:50.213]  So that's what happened, Van!
[02:54:50.974 --> 02:54:52.234]  Try to explain that to your kids.
[02:54:52.595 --> 02:54:53.455]  But of course!
[02:54:54.315 --> 02:54:54.836]  Of course!
[02:54:54.916 --> 02:55:00.279]  How is Van Jones going to explain this to his kids when he can't even accept it himself?
[02:55:02.970 --> 02:55:04.731]  It's gonna be impossible for you, Van.
[02:55:05.591 --> 02:55:12.633]  You can't live in reality, so of course you can't explain to your kids the reality of the situation.
[02:55:13.733 --> 02:55:15.854]  So, I don't know what Van Jones' problem is.
[02:55:18.155 --> 02:55:21.416]  I don't think he... I mean, he's a well-spoken guy.
[02:55:21.436 --> 02:55:22.696]  I think he's smart.
[02:55:23.376 --> 02:55:30.999]  But for whatever reason, he cannot lift the veil of the propaganda that he has helped perpetuate.
[02:55:31.823 --> 02:55:33.164]  So really a shocking situation.
[02:55:33.204 --> 02:55:35.184]  Do actually, let's finish that Van Jones clip.
[02:55:36.885 --> 02:55:37.665]  Do we have more of that?
[02:55:37.685 --> 02:55:41.327]  Afraid of breakfast.
[02:55:42.327 --> 02:55:44.868]  They're afraid of, how do I explain this to my children?
[02:55:45.149 --> 02:55:49.911]  I have Muslim friends who are texting me tonight saying, should I leave the country?
[02:55:50.291 --> 02:55:52.292]  No, not if you're an American citizen.
[02:55:52.312 --> 02:55:55.093]  I have families of immigrants that are terrified tonight.
[02:55:55.393 --> 02:55:56.974]  Oh, they're legal immigrants then, so they're fine.
[02:55:56.994 --> 02:55:57.734]  There's many things.
[02:55:58.894 --> 02:55:59.134]  I think so.
[02:56:18.590 --> 02:56:21.971]  This was a white lash against a changing country.
[02:56:22.672 --> 02:56:25.793]  It was a white lash against a black president in part.
[02:56:25.973 --> 02:56:26.553]  Half black.
[02:56:26.593 --> 02:56:28.894]  And that's the part where the pain comes.
[02:56:29.474 --> 02:56:41.259]  And Donald Trump has a responsibility tonight to come out and reassure people that he is going to be the president of all the people who he insulted and offended and brushed aside.
[02:56:41.359 --> 02:56:44.780]  Yeah, when you say you want to take your country back,
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:46.181]  Look at Jeffrey Lord.
[02:56:46.361 --> 02:56:49.403]  He's just like... Is this guy real?
[02:56:49.563 --> 02:56:50.344]  Is this guy serious?
[02:56:50.804 --> 02:56:59.790]  But we don't want to feel that someone has been elected by throwing away some of us to appeal more deeply to others.
[02:57:00.110 --> 02:57:02.612]  So this is a deeply painful moment tonight.
[02:57:02.812 --> 02:57:04.033]  I know it's not just about race.
[02:57:04.193 --> 02:57:04.993]  There's more going on.
[02:57:05.013 --> 02:57:06.995]  Hillary Clinton called us deplorable!
[02:57:07.515 --> 02:57:09.436]  Hillary Clinton called us deplorable!
[02:57:09.717 --> 02:57:17.061]  He said that Trump is the one that's demonizing all these people, putting all these people down in order to lift himself up.
[02:57:17.762 --> 02:57:19.223]  That's Hillary Clinton!
[02:57:22.645 --> 02:57:23.605]  Oh my god.
[02:57:23.765 --> 02:57:30.670]  You know, maybe Van Jones... Maybe Van Jones is one of these people that...
[02:57:32.182 --> 02:57:43.647]  He just hates Republicans so much that he cannot accept that anything Republican is valid or that anything Republican isn't bigoted.
[02:57:44.448 --> 02:57:46.389]  Maybe that's what Van Jones' problem is.
[02:57:47.486 --> 02:57:48.226]  Because he gets it.
[02:57:48.267 --> 02:57:48.867]  He's admitted it.
[02:57:48.927 --> 02:57:50.068]  When I talked to him, he admitted it.
[02:57:50.108 --> 02:57:52.209]  Yeah, Donald Trump is against the establishment.
[02:57:52.469 --> 02:57:53.710]  Donald Trump is against the elites.
[02:57:54.030 --> 02:57:58.993]  Donald Trump is the middle finger to the establishment, to the Washington politicians that have been screwing this country.
[02:57:59.033 --> 02:57:59.954]  Yes, he accepts that.
[02:58:00.434 --> 02:58:02.055]  But he's so racist!
[02:58:02.295 --> 02:58:05.998]  He's so bigoted that we have to put in a criminal!
[02:58:07.199 --> 02:58:08.339]  That's Van Jones logic.
[02:58:09.520 --> 02:58:11.461]  And then what does that even mean, a white lash?
[02:58:11.761 --> 02:58:12.302]  First of all,
[02:58:13.739 --> 02:58:16.282]  President Barack Obama is half black.
[02:58:16.782 --> 02:58:18.143]  Now, it doesn't matter to me.
[02:58:18.363 --> 02:58:20.325]  He can be half black, full black, whatever.
[02:58:20.345 --> 02:58:21.286]  It's not a difference.
[02:58:21.706 --> 02:58:33.476]  But he's going to sit here and act like this is some sort of a race-related issue, like people don't like Barack Obama because he's black, and this is a white-lash because Barack Obama was a black president.
[02:58:33.817 --> 02:58:37.139]  Well then, hey, Van, why didn't that happen four years ago?
[02:58:38.400 --> 02:58:39.762]  See, your logic
[02:58:41.444 --> 02:58:42.225]  It's baseless.
[02:58:43.366 --> 02:58:47.990]  There's no actual foundation to your thought pattern.
[02:58:49.152 --> 02:58:50.913]  You are the hearsay mafia.
[02:58:52.314 --> 02:58:53.135]  And I'm sorry.
[02:58:53.155 --> 02:58:54.336]  Hey, I was the same way.
[02:58:54.436 --> 02:58:54.957]  I talked about it.
[02:58:54.977 --> 02:58:55.978]  I've had friends text me.
[02:58:56.538 --> 02:58:56.598]  Oh!
[02:58:57.759 --> 02:59:01.501]  You know, I'm not an American citizen, I'm here on a visa, I'm gonna get deported tomorrow, what do I do?
[02:59:01.521 --> 02:59:03.942]  That's not what's happening here, folks!
[02:59:04.782 --> 02:59:09.324]  That's not even close, but because you don't understand the real issues, you're missing out entirely.
[02:59:10.125 --> 02:59:17.148]  So I don't know what, you know what, I'm sorry, Van Jones, I guess it's gonna be a tough night for you to try to explain to your, uh...
[02:59:18.437 --> 02:59:24.080]  I don't know if the Muslim friend of his is American or not, but if they're an American citizen, then they're just fine.
[02:59:24.600 --> 02:59:25.081]  Nothing wrong.
[02:59:25.541 --> 02:59:26.441]  They'll be perfectly fine.
[02:59:27.562 --> 02:59:29.103]  He talks about immigrant friends.
[02:59:29.163 --> 02:59:33.045]  Well, if they're legal immigrants, if they're citizens, if they immigrated here, then they're fine.
[02:59:33.085 --> 02:59:34.626]  I mean, what's the problem?
[02:59:34.646 --> 02:59:35.266]  I don't understand.
[02:59:36.387 --> 02:59:37.868]  But Van Jones doesn't get it.
[02:59:38.688 --> 02:59:43.210]  He, for whatever reason, has a brain that can't fully function.
[02:59:43.391 --> 02:59:45.071]  He's got his blinders on.
[02:59:46.291 --> 02:59:49.012]  You know, it's going to be a tough night for him, I guess.
[02:59:49.072 --> 03:00:03.136]  It's going to be a tough four years for Van Jones to try to cover the news and to try to explain to his friends and family why Donald Trump won, even though it's very obvious.
[03:00:04.376 --> 03:00:08.957]  Now, can you bring me in that Yahoo story that I printed out, please, guys?
[03:00:08.997 --> 03:00:10.818]  I want to cover this Yahoo story real quick.
[03:00:12.193 --> 03:00:16.174]  This was the last push notification that I received from Yahoo.
[03:00:17.034 --> 03:00:20.916]  Now, Yahoo has been completely in the tank for Hillary.
[03:00:21.696 --> 03:00:28.858]  Yahoo has been one of the establishment wings bashing Donald Trump on a daily basis.
[03:00:32.073 --> 03:00:51.363]  I got push notifications routinely from Yahoo bashing Donald Trump, even all the false rape claims, all the false allegations against Trump, where all of these women that came forward had to back off their claims, all of these women that came forward, oh, Donald Trump raped me when I was 13, yeah, she had to back off.
[03:00:51.403 --> 03:00:53.224]  They've all made it up, folks, they all made it up.
[03:00:53.484 --> 03:00:57.306]  But Yahoo and the New York Times ran with all those stories that were completely untrue.
[03:00:57.346 --> 03:00:58.167]  But here's Yahoo.
[03:00:59.304 --> 03:01:01.766]  Again folks, here's what it is.
[03:01:04.568 --> 03:01:26.104]  The elements within the establishment are so arrogant and they've been able to get away with providing false narratives that then are forced upon the American people as reality that now that they've reached this point in time where it's failing,
[03:01:27.895 --> 03:01:33.180]  They're having to now start to find a way to twist it because they can't admit they failed.
[03:01:33.621 --> 03:01:36.364]  They can't admit that their brainwashing propaganda failed.
[03:01:36.684 --> 03:01:38.886]  They can't admit that they've been wrong the whole time.
[03:01:38.966 --> 03:01:40.228]  So now they make excuses.
[03:01:41.509 --> 03:01:43.371]  So this is what came out of Yahoo.
[03:01:44.192 --> 03:01:46.074]  Trump's stunning campaign.
[03:01:47.515 --> 03:01:49.037]  Rewrote all the rules.
[03:01:50.563 --> 03:02:05.340]  His candidacy was born in spectacle, nurtured on controversy, yeah, drummed up controversy from the establishment news sources like Yahoo, and careered from one self-inflicted disaster to another.
[03:02:06.281 --> 03:02:07.722]  Self-inflicted disaster.
[03:02:07.882 --> 03:02:16.186]  Again, no mainstream news twisting things Donald Trump says and then providing a false narrative.
[03:02:16.826 --> 03:02:20.948]  Overturning every rule of modern American politics along the way.
[03:02:22.009 --> 03:02:23.949]  Modern rule of American politics.
[03:02:25.130 --> 03:02:25.670]  Lying.
[03:02:26.611 --> 03:02:27.091]  Cheating.
[03:02:28.372 --> 03:02:28.812]  Rigging.
[03:02:29.292 --> 03:02:29.932]  Colluding.
[03:02:30.252 --> 03:02:30.793]  Corrupting.
[03:02:31.823 --> 03:02:34.784]  I think Yahoo is actually right on that one.
[03:02:35.244 --> 03:03:00.095]  With virtually no on-the-ground organization, lackadaisical support at best from the leaders of his own party, I'd say hardly any, and outspent by a large margin in advertising, Donald Trump won the presidency with a campaign built around raucous rallies and a visceral appeal to a shrinking slice of the American electorate, the rural and small-town white working class.
[03:03:01.255 --> 03:03:03.296]  So Van Jones blames white people.
[03:03:04.337 --> 03:03:06.078]  Yahoo blames white people.
[03:03:07.199 --> 03:03:08.680]  So I guess this is what they're going to do.
[03:03:09.501 --> 03:03:15.645]  I guess this is what they're going to do is blame white people and then try to foment a race war.
[03:03:18.843 --> 03:03:23.006]  I guess that that is how they think this thing is gonna go.
[03:03:23.066 --> 03:03:24.968]  But here's what I expect from the media.
[03:03:25.929 --> 03:03:28.611]  Tonight, all we saw was, we're shocked!
[03:03:28.651 --> 03:03:29.471]  How did this happen?
[03:03:29.511 --> 03:03:30.812]  Oh my God, no way!
[03:03:30.892 --> 03:03:31.853]  Shocking upset!
[03:03:32.754 --> 03:03:34.555]  Oh my God, nobody expected this!
[03:03:34.655 --> 03:03:35.896]  How could this have happened?
[03:03:35.976 --> 03:03:36.497]  Wow!
[03:03:37.938 --> 03:03:39.419]  So that was their response tonight.
[03:03:39.979 --> 03:03:45.584]  I guess in the future, what I expect to see is excuse-making,
[03:03:47.134 --> 03:03:49.136]  And I guess blaming white people.
[03:03:50.116 --> 03:03:52.878]  Again, they mention it again at the end of the next paragraph.
[03:03:53.959 --> 03:03:56.301]  Trump's huge advantage among white men.
[03:03:57.442 --> 03:03:59.123]  White, white, white, white.
[03:03:59.483 --> 03:04:01.565]  In fact, would you guys do me a favor?
[03:04:01.625 --> 03:04:06.589]  Let's do a command F and let's see how many times they say white in this story.
[03:04:07.149 --> 03:04:08.330]  Can we look that up real quick?
[03:04:12.005 --> 03:04:14.207]  You guys know how to do a, do a search.
[03:04:14.947 --> 03:04:15.808]  Do a word search.
[03:04:15.868 --> 03:04:17.470]  Hit command F. There you go.
[03:04:18.310 --> 03:04:19.111]  And search white.
[03:04:19.151 --> 03:04:22.414]  Let's see how many times they blame white people in this Yahoo story.
[03:04:26.577 --> 03:04:28.459]  So just hit enter once you've hit white.
[03:04:28.719 --> 03:04:29.560]  And just hit enter.
[03:04:29.720 --> 03:04:30.320]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:04:31.081 --> 03:04:32.342]  And it should go to each one.
[03:04:32.402 --> 03:04:33.603]  So there's the two we've covered.
[03:04:33.643 --> 03:04:34.824]  Let's see if they've mentioned any more.
[03:04:34.844 --> 03:04:36.125]  Is that it guys?
[03:04:36.185 --> 03:04:36.746]  Just hit enter.
[03:04:36.826 --> 03:04:37.406]  Keep hitting enter.
[03:04:39.788 --> 03:04:40.149]  Only two?
[03:04:41.598 --> 03:04:50.266]  Alright, so they did it only twice, but they made sure to get it in at the top of the article because that's what people normally read before they give up and move on to the next thing.
[03:04:51.026 --> 03:04:57.112]  But maybe that's the plan, I guess, try to foment a race war, blame white people for this, which is really sad.
[03:04:57.132 --> 03:04:59.414]  You know, actually, that's the most racist thing you can do.
[03:05:02.082 --> 03:05:24.097]  Not because, okay, you're racist against white people, I guess you could make that claim, but honestly, to say that this is white people's fault that Donald Trump got elected, honestly, that's racist against black people, that's racist against Latinos, because I guarantee you Donald Trump does not win this election without the support and endorsement of black people and Latino people.
[03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:28.041]  So this is another example of total hypocrisy.
[03:05:28.061 --> 03:05:43.464]  Yahoo, Van Jones are going to be racist and blame this election on white people and completely ignore the black constituents of Trump, completely ignore the Latino constituents of Trump, because that goes against their narrative.
[03:05:43.504 --> 03:05:45.224]  That doesn't help foment a race war.
[03:05:45.764 --> 03:05:46.884]  But this is an example.
[03:05:46.924 --> 03:05:47.985]  This is the hypocrisy.
[03:05:48.005 --> 03:05:49.325]  This is a white male.
[03:05:50.265 --> 03:05:57.053]  Telling a white male his opinion doesn't matter and that he's racist and that's basically what's going on.
[03:05:57.114 --> 03:05:57.955]  It's white people's fault.
[03:05:58.015 --> 03:05:58.916]  It's white people's fault.
[03:05:59.697 --> 03:06:08.327]  But then being racist and completely discounting the fact that black people and Latino people also supported and helped get Trump in office.
[03:06:09.147 --> 03:06:19.217]  So, just, you know, this is what we can expect, I think, in the near future, in the next two months, before Trump is inaugurated in the final two months of the Obama administration.
[03:06:19.858 --> 03:06:20.719]  Hey, you guys, you know what?
[03:06:20.879 --> 03:06:21.159]  I think...
[03:06:22.895 --> 03:06:24.236]  Yeah, Obama's got a tee time.
[03:06:24.256 --> 03:06:27.318]  Obama's tee time is in two hours.
[03:06:27.338 --> 03:06:32.662]  He's got a big golf match coming up, so let's hope Obama makes it to that tee time perfectly safe.
[03:06:33.362 --> 03:06:35.844]  All right, let's go to Michael.
[03:06:35.864 --> 03:06:39.146]  We will take your calls, folks.
[03:06:39.166 --> 03:06:41.347]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[03:06:41.367 --> 03:06:42.228]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[03:06:42.648 --> 03:06:43.929]  We now go to Michael in Georgia.
[03:06:43.969 --> 03:06:44.569]  Go ahead, Michael.
[03:06:45.910 --> 03:06:50.754]  Hey, I'm not sure if you're talking to me, but... Yeah, go ahead.
[03:06:51.903 --> 03:06:53.344]  Right on.
[03:06:55.204 --> 03:07:04.388]  You know, one thing that concerns me is that everyone's really happy that Trump has won.
[03:07:05.368 --> 03:07:12.010]  But when we look at this government, and we look at this governmental system, what's going to happen in the morning?
[03:07:12.030 --> 03:07:13.311]  I mean, has he won?
[03:07:15.252 --> 03:07:19.575]  In other words, is this real?
[03:07:20.315 --> 03:07:22.857]  Or are we going to wake up to some other reality?
[03:07:23.617 --> 03:07:37.866]  And the next thing that really concerns me is that I was thinking about this concept of if Hillary won,
[03:07:39.433 --> 03:07:44.397]  Uh, which would be just my worst thing, you know, my concept, worst concept ever.
[03:07:44.737 --> 03:07:46.959]  If she won, what would that mean to me?
[03:07:47.379 --> 03:07:50.702]  And I started thinking about it because I would think she would win.
[03:07:50.722 --> 03:08:06.513]  And then I thought, well, uh, because I'm a Christian, I thought, well, God would be involved and, uh, there would be, you know, uh, God has his own plan and everything else.
[03:08:06.613 --> 03:08:06.934]  And so,
[03:08:09.019 --> 03:08:24.305]  I would think that God would have, well, he'd basically be punishing the United States of America for the crimes that we've done against the world.
[03:08:24.325 --> 03:08:36.910]  You know, under the Bushes, not the Clintons, the Clintons too, but under the Bushes, the Clintons, all of these regimes.
[03:08:37.645 --> 03:08:41.726]  I mean, how many people did the Bushes kill on planet Earth?
[03:08:43.247 --> 03:08:44.027]  Am I still on?
[03:08:45.507 --> 03:08:49.988]  Yeah, and specifically, I think you're talking about their policies, going to war.
[03:08:50.008 --> 03:08:51.969]  No, I'm talking about their fake wars.
[03:08:52.269 --> 03:08:52.669]  Yeah, right.
[03:08:52.689 --> 03:08:56.110]  I'm talking about their unconstitutional wars.
[03:08:56.590 --> 03:09:04.572]  I'm talking about Bush 1, his war in Iraq, and him talking about New World Order.
[03:09:04.972 --> 03:09:06.933]  I'm talking about Bush
[03:09:08.370 --> 03:09:22.236]  Clinton, I guess, talking, I don't know, because I'm not a political, you know, whatever, but the war against drugs on America.
[03:09:22.857 --> 03:09:24.257]  We import.
[03:09:25.618 --> 03:09:28.419]  I used to live in Southern California.
[03:09:28.699 --> 03:09:32.241]  We import the cocaine.
[03:09:33.461 --> 03:09:37.183]  You know, and Mexico is our drug laundering nation.
[03:09:37.810 --> 03:09:44.174]  Well, you can look at what happened to Afghanistan since the United States took over.
[03:09:44.234 --> 03:09:46.835]  Now all the opium comes out of Afghanistan.
[03:09:46.855 --> 03:09:53.639]  We're in Afghanistan for going on 15 years for one reason, and that's opium.
[03:09:54.299 --> 03:09:54.479]  Yep.
[03:09:55.360 --> 03:09:58.682]  Okay, so then we have a second Bush war.
[03:10:00.143 --> 03:10:00.503]  Okay.
[03:10:00.903 --> 03:10:03.964]  That is for weapons of mass destruction.
[03:10:04.244 --> 03:10:08.145]  We never found any weapons of mass destruction.
[03:10:08.445 --> 03:10:10.085]  And I voted for these people.
[03:10:10.385 --> 03:10:11.365]  Yeah, but see, but that's the thing.
[03:10:11.405 --> 03:10:15.226]  That's the beauty of this because we kept another Bush out.
[03:10:15.286 --> 03:10:16.887]  We kept Jeb Bush out.
[03:10:16.967 --> 03:10:17.687]  Jeb Bush is done.
[03:10:18.047 --> 03:10:19.567]  And Van Jones can sit here.
[03:10:19.587 --> 03:10:22.248]  Oh, how can I explain this to my kids?
[03:10:22.368 --> 03:10:24.748]  Oh my God, what am I going to do?
[03:10:24.788 --> 03:10:25.869]  This is so bad.
[03:10:25.889 --> 03:10:26.969]  Hey, Van.
[03:10:29.463 --> 03:10:31.724]  I understand why you don't like Republicans, okay?
[03:10:31.944 --> 03:10:36.045]  I understand why George Bush probably left a sour taste in your mouth.
[03:10:36.085 --> 03:10:42.466]  We all feel the same way about George Bush, at least I would imagine here in this, within this organization.
[03:10:42.506 --> 03:10:43.206]  But here's the thing.
[03:10:45.607 --> 03:10:51.888]  You know, he wants to sit here and be so upset over Donald Trump for all this faux racism, faux bigotry, whatever it is.
[03:10:52.829 --> 03:10:53.809]  Or even if it's real!
[03:10:56.607 --> 03:11:00.110]  Donald Trump doesn't want to start wars overseas!
[03:11:01.270 --> 03:11:04.273]  Donald Trump doesn't want to go to World War III with Russia!
[03:11:05.413 --> 03:11:06.414]  It was the Bushes!
[03:11:07.074 --> 03:11:14.340]  Van Jones should be happy that Donald Trump kept Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush away from the White House.
[03:11:14.840 --> 03:11:18.703]  If it wasn't for that, we would be going into another war.
[03:11:18.823 --> 03:11:19.503]  I agree, caller.
[03:11:19.543 --> 03:11:20.724]  Thank you so much for the call.
[03:11:20.944 --> 03:11:24.327]  But Van Jones, he can't get that through his head, you see?
[03:11:25.885 --> 03:11:43.310]  He's so obsessed over the false narrative, over the propaganda that he helped perpetuate in his own weak mind that Trump is a racist, Trump is a bigot, and he assumed in his own arrogance that by him
[03:11:44.488 --> 03:11:51.131]  Preaching these things, selling you these things, that there's no way you could elect Donald Trump.
[03:11:51.171 --> 03:11:52.332]  There's no way!
[03:11:52.632 --> 03:11:53.893]  I'm Van Jones!
[03:11:54.413 --> 03:11:56.114]  I told you he was a racist!
[03:11:56.354 --> 03:11:58.515]  There's no way America could elect him!
[03:12:00.676 --> 03:12:02.277]  That's what happened to you, Van Jones!
[03:12:02.737 --> 03:12:06.539]  And now you have to embrace that reality, but you still can't do it, can ya?
[03:12:06.939 --> 03:12:08.800]  You're still gonna try to figure it out.
[03:12:10.180 --> 03:12:11.301]  It's so difficult.
[03:12:12.614 --> 03:12:14.595]  How you're gonna explain this to the kids?
[03:12:15.855 --> 03:12:16.095]  Wow.
[03:12:16.335 --> 03:12:19.336]  Boy, I tell ya, I'm just glad I'm not Van Jones.
[03:12:19.916 --> 03:12:23.437]  Because that must be a difficult life to live.
[03:12:26.138 --> 03:12:27.898]  Really just being a confused individual.
[03:12:27.918 --> 03:12:31.419]  Alright, I don't have any names of these other callers on the board.
[03:12:31.559 --> 03:12:32.960]  I'm not sure what's going on there.
[03:12:34.400 --> 03:12:38.101]  You know, I said this earlier this evening in a tweet.
[03:12:39.561 --> 03:12:41.722]  And I think it really goes to show the nature
[03:12:43.223 --> 03:12:48.926]  Of the two sides of this election, as far as the voters were concerned, and it can really tell a story.
[03:12:50.867 --> 03:13:05.815]  Hillary Clinton voters went to the polls and voted and sat back tonight waiting the results, thinking, hoping we're going to stop the evil Donald Trump.
[03:13:07.213 --> 03:13:14.318]  All Hillary Clinton voters were thinking tonight is, or first woman president, or we're going to stop the evil Donald Trump.
[03:13:14.378 --> 03:13:17.541]  Those were the two thoughts that Hillary Clinton voters had tonight.
[03:13:17.641 --> 03:13:20.363]  Either, we finally got the first woman president, yay!
[03:13:20.543 --> 03:13:26.007]  Or, we're going to stop Donald, we have to stop Donald, he's a racist, he's a bigot, he's the worst man ever, he's evil, he's evil, he's bad.
[03:13:26.868 --> 03:13:27.949]  He's a Russian, you know.
[03:13:29.250 --> 03:13:34.634]  So that's what Hillary Clinton voters are sitting back, hoping and wishing tonight during this process.
[03:13:36.263 --> 03:13:44.209]  Trump voters, meanwhile, are sitting back thinking, man, I really want to get Trump in so we can beat the establishment.
[03:13:44.809 --> 03:13:49.632]  Man, I really want to get Trump in so we can drain the swamp in Washington and end the corruption.
[03:13:49.672 --> 03:13:52.895]  Man, I want to get Trump in because I want policies that are American first.
[03:13:54.015 --> 03:13:56.037]  Do you see the dynamic difference here, folks?
[03:13:57.398 --> 03:14:03.122]  Do you see the dynamic difference in the mindset of a Trump voter versus a Hillary Clinton voter?
[03:14:04.963 --> 03:14:13.850]  And I think that the illustration that I just made for you is very understandable, very palpable.
[03:14:15.651 --> 03:14:16.452]  Because what is it?
[03:14:16.832 --> 03:14:20.775]  Again, when you talk to these Hillary Clinton supporters, what do they say?
[03:14:21.135 --> 03:14:22.376]  There's two of them right there.
[03:14:22.716 --> 03:14:24.998]  Female Abe Skrillex, female Carl the Cuck.
[03:14:26.059 --> 03:14:29.181]  They didn't say anything why they like Hillary Clinton.
[03:14:29.942 --> 03:14:32.304]  All they said was why Donald Trump is so bad.
[03:14:33.663 --> 03:14:46.414]  So all of these Hillary Clinton voters tonight are hoping that they either elected the first woman president or that they stopped the evil racist Donald Trump to completely
[03:14:48.356 --> 03:14:49.557]  I don't even know the word.
[03:14:50.978 --> 03:14:52.960]  Irrelevant to this election.
[03:14:53.040 --> 03:15:09.454]  Two things that are totally irrelevant to this election, totally irrelevant to the future, totally irrelevant to reality, and they're sitting here living in their reality that doesn't actually exist, hoping I just got the first woman in president.
[03:15:09.814 --> 03:15:11.515]  Hoping I just stopped Donald Trump.
[03:15:12.276 --> 03:15:14.298]  Completely irrelevant.
[03:15:15.270 --> 03:15:20.133]  But then Trump supporters are saying, I hope Trump wins, I want to end the corruption in Washington.
[03:15:20.553 --> 03:15:23.235]  I hope Trump wins, I want an American first president.
[03:15:23.735 --> 03:15:25.777]  I hope Trump wins, I want to secure that border.
[03:15:25.877 --> 03:15:26.757]  Do you see the difference?
[03:15:27.418 --> 03:15:28.738]  Do you see the difference?
[03:15:30.259 --> 03:15:31.840]  It's pretty obvious to me.
[03:15:32.341 --> 03:15:42.527]  So it is now official, with the current tally, Hillary Clinton is winning the popular vote.
[03:15:44.218 --> 03:15:48.479]  So I'm not sure she's going to win California by well over 2 million votes.
[03:15:48.519 --> 03:15:49.860]  That's of course all this is.
[03:15:50.760 --> 03:15:56.462]  The only reason why Hillary Clinton wins this popular vote is because of California.
[03:15:56.602 --> 03:15:58.762]  And you could probably give a little credit to New York there too.
[03:15:58.802 --> 03:16:00.083]  But it's mainly California.
[03:16:00.223 --> 03:16:01.903]  The dumbest of the dumb.
[03:16:03.104 --> 03:16:04.404]  Mark Dice has proved that.
[03:16:05.706 --> 03:16:08.629]  But it does look like Hillary Clinton will win the popular vote.
[03:16:09.209 --> 03:16:13.212]  Before we take more calls, I have to remind you about Infowarsstore.com, folks.
[03:16:13.753 --> 03:16:15.794]  This is how we fund the broadcast.
[03:16:15.834 --> 03:16:19.077]  We don't take money from big pharmaceutical companies.
[03:16:19.918 --> 03:16:23.641]  We don't take money from Food Incorporated.
[03:16:24.161 --> 03:16:26.443]  We just sell great products.
[03:16:26.523 --> 03:16:29.686]  We fund ourselves with your support.
[03:16:30.976 --> 03:16:33.759]  You are the sponsor of this broadcast, folks.
[03:16:33.839 --> 03:16:40.307]  By going to Infowarsstore.com, by buying the great products that we offer there, that's how this broadcast is sponsored.
[03:16:40.407 --> 03:16:41.989]  You are in charge of this broadcast.
[03:16:42.009 --> 03:16:49.438]  See, the reason why the mainstream news is so controlled and can't report on a lot of stories like vaccines,
[03:16:51.480 --> 03:16:53.481]  Is because they're bought and paid for, you see?
[03:16:53.501 --> 03:17:06.869]  If they start to cover stuff like that, or, you know, instead of blaming guns for mass shooters, perhaps looking into a link between psychotropic drugs, pharmaceutical drugs and mass shooters, no, they can't do that.
[03:17:06.969 --> 03:17:07.289]  Why?
[03:17:07.710 --> 03:17:11.572]  Because they don't have any gun sponsors, they have big pharmaceutical sponsors.
[03:17:11.812 --> 03:17:17.335]  So they can't go on air and present to you truth and news coverage because they have to watch their sponsors back.
[03:17:17.755 --> 03:17:18.656]  Who's our sponsors?
[03:17:19.056 --> 03:17:20.476]  You are our sponsors.

[03:18:16.648 --> 03:18:21.569]  We have a moment of opportunity here to overtake the mainstream media.
[03:18:21.609 --> 03:18:23.229]  Now, we've already done it.
[03:18:23.889 --> 03:18:25.890]  We already have done it in the sense that
[03:18:26.909 --> 03:18:30.750]  We're the ones that present news based in reality.
[03:18:31.731 --> 03:18:34.411]  We're the ones trying to give you the real story.
[03:18:35.912 --> 03:18:39.293]  We're the ones that told you Trump could win.
[03:18:40.313 --> 03:18:44.614]  We're the ones that have been right time and time again.
[03:18:45.295 --> 03:18:55.478]  So we're already winning in that aspect, but we're talking about going to the next level where talking about CNN or MSNBC is passe.
[03:18:56.789 --> 03:19:00.144]  Now we're almost at that point now, but we're now...
[03:19:01.627 --> 03:19:05.449]  At a point where we can literally zoom by them.
[03:19:05.789 --> 03:19:09.331]  Just blast off right past the fake media.
[03:19:10.192 --> 03:19:14.674]  And just like what Donald Trump said with his election, it's all up to you folks.
[03:19:15.215 --> 03:19:16.935]  You share the link with friends and family.
[03:19:17.456 --> 03:19:19.297]  You go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:19.957 --> 03:19:22.919]  That's what takes this operation to the next level.
[03:19:22.939 --> 03:19:24.460]  So I thank you, the listener.
[03:19:24.520 --> 03:19:27.581]  Let's go to Matthew in Georgia.
[03:19:27.641 --> 03:19:28.422]  Go ahead, Matthew.
[03:19:30.032 --> 03:19:32.453]  Oh, and I want to say you're doing a great job, man.
[03:19:32.493 --> 03:19:34.013]  I've got a couple of points to make.
[03:19:35.774 --> 03:19:47.017]  One being, if I read correctly, us taking control of the House and the Senate, I believe that's the first time that's happened for the Republican Party with the President since 1928.
[03:19:47.157 --> 03:19:50.258]  Isn't that great, too?
[03:19:50.298 --> 03:19:50.859]  That's great.
[03:19:51.199 --> 03:19:52.019]  Oh, that's amazing.
[03:19:52.279 --> 03:19:55.400]  And the thing is, though, what I want to encourage anyone that's listening now,
[03:19:56.417 --> 03:20:00.000]  We've got the opportunity to, by default, take the Supreme Court as well.
[03:20:01.101 --> 03:20:12.049]  And we need, for everyone, if you live in an area that was fortunate enough to hang on to a conservative, you need to be contacting your elected officials and telling them, don't let us down in these four years.
[03:20:12.129 --> 03:20:24.479]  We delivered this to you collectively, and we need you to be there for us, because we have the potential to set ourselves up for decades to come with the Liberty Movement and to solidify the Constitution.
[03:20:25.990 --> 03:20:38.774]  But that being my first point, my second point being, and I also have a question for you, my second point being, I actually had a little bit of a sad experience today when I went to vote.
[03:20:40.095 --> 03:20:49.818]  A young man came in behind me and he, when he went through the process to get his voter card, they couldn't find him in the registration database.
[03:20:49.938 --> 03:20:54.100]  And fortunately, we do live in a state that requires, you know, ID to be able to vote.
[03:20:56.448 --> 03:21:08.253]  Come to find out he had been on deployment in 2012 in the military and didn't know when he voted by absentee ballot then that he had to re-register into his home district when he moved back home.
[03:21:08.553 --> 03:21:10.593]  It was just an error on his part.
[03:21:11.554 --> 03:21:14.475]  He was devastated to know he wasn't going to get to vote.
[03:21:14.495 --> 03:21:19.777]  And I found it sad because I thought this man fought for our nation.
[03:21:21.400 --> 03:21:23.662]  And Obama endorses that, even encourages it.
[03:21:23.682 --> 03:21:23.762]  Yep.
[03:21:23.802 --> 03:21:24.182]  Despicable.
[03:21:24.622 --> 03:21:26.444]  Absolutely despicable.
[03:21:52.185 --> 03:21:57.387]  Before any results had come in, basically conceding that Trump had lost.
[03:21:59.387 --> 03:22:02.769]  Uh, I did not, I did not see or hear anything about that.
[03:22:02.849 --> 03:22:03.409]  Oh, there you go.
[03:22:03.449 --> 03:22:04.329]  They found it right there.
[03:22:04.349 --> 03:22:04.409]  Huh.
[03:22:06.030 --> 03:22:06.810]  Ted Cruz.
[03:22:07.450 --> 03:22:13.772]  You know, I don't, I don't understand Ted Cruz to be honest with you because here's a guy who
[03:22:17.029 --> 03:22:19.350]  Uh, filibustered for 24 hours.
[03:22:20.450 --> 03:22:22.471]  Uh, what was it, against Obamacare, I think?
[03:22:22.511 --> 03:22:23.531]  The Affordable Care Act.
[03:22:24.671 --> 03:22:31.553]  Uh, here's a guy who's done a lot of great things, um, as his time as a senator.
[03:22:31.613 --> 03:22:32.833]  This is a satire piece.
[03:22:33.653 --> 03:22:34.774]  Okay, so... It is satire.
[03:22:36.718 --> 03:22:41.942]  But still, I still don't understand Ted Cruz, to be perfectly honest with you, even if this is satire or not.
[03:22:43.744 --> 03:22:45.805]  I can see how that's kind of like an onion type of thing.
[03:22:45.885 --> 03:22:53.291]  But the thing about it is, to me, it's like, Ted Cruz has a lot of great, he's got a good voting record in many cases.
[03:22:54.412 --> 03:22:57.774]  As a Texas Senator, he's said a lot of good things, he did the filibuster.
[03:22:58.435 --> 03:23:05.280]  Then he runs against Trump and turns into a complete government shill, a complete Bush hitman.
[03:23:06.457 --> 03:23:06.898]  I don't
[03:23:23.885 --> 03:23:25.746]  And then he kind of goes back into old Ted.
[03:23:26.707 --> 03:23:31.690]  Constitutional, sticking up for internet freedom in America.
[03:23:31.710 --> 03:23:36.913]  He was one of the leading voices to try to stop the UN takeover of the internet.
[03:23:38.394 --> 03:23:42.697]  But then it was so hard for him to endorse Trump too, so there was that aspect.
[03:23:42.717 --> 03:23:43.998]  Ted Cruz is just a weird guy.
[03:23:46.024 --> 03:23:47.645]  But yeah, thank you for the call, Matthew.
[03:23:47.665 --> 03:23:49.545]  I don't think Trump will let us down.
[03:23:49.605 --> 03:23:55.888]  I think that as long as we the people hold Donald Trump's feet to the fire, which is what's gonna happen, you know the media's gonna do it.
[03:23:55.908 --> 03:24:01.710]  They didn't do it to Obama, for the most part, at least, I mean, to the extent they should have.
[03:24:03.134 --> 03:24:08.037]  But Donald Trump is already the most hated president, and he hasn't even taken office yet.
[03:24:08.957 --> 03:24:11.218]  The media is going to be all over him for anything he does.
[03:24:12.639 --> 03:24:24.305]  It'll be interesting to see if any of these false narratives against Trump's character stick or linger around through the inauguration process or after that.
[03:24:25.346 --> 03:24:29.588]  I doubt it, considering how baseless and completely made up even some of these claims were.
[03:24:30.448 --> 03:24:36.230]  But, you know, I think that the American people, the voters who put Trump in, are going to hold his feet to the fire.
[03:24:36.590 --> 03:24:41.031]  There's still bigger issues that go way above and beyond this election cycle.
[03:24:41.331 --> 03:24:50.314]  I mean, my God, imagine if Donald Trump got in, had an inauguration speech, and said, folks, we are no longer going to fluoridate our water.
[03:24:50.334 --> 03:24:54.676]  I mean, that would be like, oh my God.
[03:24:55.316 --> 03:24:58.717]  This guy is unfrickin' real.
[03:24:59.943 --> 03:25:00.423]  But I don't know.
[03:25:00.483 --> 03:25:01.883]  He's never even mentioned anything like that.
[03:25:01.943 --> 03:25:03.084]  I'm not even sure if he's aware of that.
[03:25:03.964 --> 03:25:22.427]  But the point is, as long as the people maintain the thought process that he's accountable to them, as long as they maintain their vigilance, Donald Trump working with and for the American people could be the change that we've been waiting for and deserving for a long, long time.
[03:25:22.487 --> 03:25:24.307]  Or I guess not deserving until now.
[03:25:24.548 --> 03:25:26.408]  I guess now we deserve it if we voted him in.
[03:25:27.348 --> 03:25:32.130]  Um, but we really haven't had an option like Donald Trump, um, at least in my lifetime.
[03:25:32.311 --> 03:25:33.551]  I'm, uh, 26 years old.
[03:25:34.051 --> 03:25:37.333]  Let's go to Richard in Washington.
[03:25:38.333 --> 03:25:39.734]  What is on your mind tonight, Richard?
[03:25:39.774 --> 03:25:40.094]  Go ahead.
[03:25:45.657 --> 03:25:49.619]  I'm excited as anybody else, obviously, that, uh, this happened.
[03:25:50.179 --> 03:25:51.560]  You know, amazing that, uh,
[03:25:52.870 --> 03:25:54.331]  I'm a little bit older than you.
[03:25:54.411 --> 03:25:57.533]  I did the, you know, I did the demagogue thing.
[03:25:57.594 --> 03:26:03.518]  I got, uh, I got hooked in on the first, uh, Obama presidency and I'm not going to do another thing.
[03:26:04.499 --> 03:26:06.960]  And the first fellow from Georgia brought it up.
[03:26:06.980 --> 03:26:10.283]  It's like, it's like your priorities, right?
[03:26:10.503 --> 03:26:14.806]  And, uh, like our foreign policy is just like insane.
[03:26:14.906 --> 03:26:19.870]  Like it's, it's seriously like satanic, like demonic, whatever you want to,
[03:26:21.804 --> 03:26:39.449]  I mean, it's just, uh, it's unconscionable to me, you know, and, uh, and I know it's like you say, I mean, obviously he's not gonna, you know, go out there and, uh, take the inauguration and be like, uh, yeah, you know, uh, we're gonna, you know, quit four, four dating.
[03:26:39.469 --> 03:26:50.252]  I don't know how you say that for, but, but putting four in the water and everything, you know, you can't expect like anybody to do it, but it, there, there are things that I'm gonna hold him to, you know, and, uh,
[03:26:51.232 --> 03:27:04.497]  And this insane foreign policy where it's just, you know, it's like I'm, I'm working hard every day like I'm sure you are to pay for them to like, like kill people like that.
[03:27:06.238 --> 03:27:08.099]  That's crazy, you know, I mean.
[03:27:10.247 --> 03:27:30.456]  Well think about it, it's the informed voter, it's the engaged American, it's the hardworking American, it's the American that cares about this country, the American that cares about this future, the American that likes to hold themselves and their friends and family accountable, and those are the people that put Trump in office, and I would imagine that those people aren't just going to change overnight.
[03:27:30.496 --> 03:27:37.179]  This is going to stay the same, they're going to stay vigilant, they're going to stay passionate about their country, about their constitution.
[03:27:37.979 --> 03:27:42.303]  And I think that, again, Donald Trump, I think he's real.
[03:27:42.463 --> 03:27:45.626]  I'm not concerned that we're going to have issues with Donald Trump.
[03:27:45.686 --> 03:27:50.550]  But, you know, in the case that we do, we're going to be here.
[03:27:50.730 --> 03:27:51.971]  We're not going to give up.
[03:27:52.011 --> 03:27:53.092]  We're not going to give in.
[03:27:53.452 --> 03:28:00.217]  We're going to fight the same fight we've been fighting, except now we have a United States president on our team.
[03:28:00.237 --> 03:28:02.639]  And this is something that's new.
[03:28:02.699 --> 03:28:05.282]  This is something I don't even think we can fully comprehend yet.
[03:28:05.922 --> 03:28:10.424]  But we're all excited for it, but at the same time we do realize we need to hold his feet to the fire.
[03:28:10.665 --> 03:28:12.025]  Thank you for the call, Richard.
[03:28:12.065 --> 03:28:13.586]  Let's go out to Cody now.
[03:28:14.527 --> 03:28:15.867]  Cody is in Texas.
[03:28:17.128 --> 03:28:18.208]  What's on your mind tonight, Cody?
[03:28:22.671 --> 03:28:23.071]  You there?
[03:28:23.331 --> 03:28:23.911]  Yep, go ahead.
[03:28:25.132 --> 03:28:31.836]  Hey, I'm just calling about the recent Putin address that just got put on YouTube by Reuters.
[03:28:32.516 --> 03:28:33.536]  RT, not Reuters.
[03:28:33.797 --> 03:28:34.397]  My apologies.
[03:28:35.411 --> 03:28:59.378]  He addressed the Cambodian and the Ugandan and a lot of Polish and New Zealand and a lot of other dignitaries while he was speaking and saying that we need to come together and all these things and I agree with that because
[03:29:00.888 --> 03:29:28.495]  Trump is also trying to agree with Russia and coming together in that, and not in a weakful way, but more in a diplomatic way, whereas Hillary would say, okay, we're going to, any kind of instance that they put across in cyber attacks or any other type of attack, we're going to immediately meet them with force.
[03:29:29.338 --> 03:29:39.470]  Or Trump is saying, no, we're going to meet them with, you know, diplomatic solutions, which is what the whole...
[03:29:41.084 --> 03:29:56.336]  Well I don't think Trump is going to be the kind of person that willingly puts the fate of the American military in the hands of weapons manufacturers or big central bankers.
[03:29:56.876 --> 03:30:00.419]  Where if a big central banker comes to the president and says,
[03:30:02.034 --> 03:30:04.176]  I can't get my central bank in Iraq.
[03:30:04.856 --> 03:30:11.101]  I need you to go in and destabilize and destroy so that I can get my central bank in there.
[03:30:11.941 --> 03:30:13.963]  And George Bush says, well, I don't know.
[03:30:14.063 --> 03:30:15.124]  How am I going to do that?
[03:30:15.324 --> 03:30:23.249]  Okay, well, let's stage a false flag, bring down the Twin Towers, write the Patriot Act, and then you can claim we need to go into Iraq to fight terrorism.
[03:30:23.289 --> 03:30:24.750]  We'll kill two birds with one stone.
[03:30:25.191 --> 03:30:25.371]  No.
[03:30:25.671 --> 03:30:30.595]  Donald Trump is not going to sell the American military down the drain like that.
[03:30:31.115 --> 03:30:32.438]  Hell no!
[03:30:33.480 --> 03:30:37.449]  And that's the kind of thing that we're looking at with Russia where...
[03:30:38.971 --> 03:30:46.796]  He's not just gonna willy-nilly try to send troops into battle with Russia because of a pissing contest over Syria.
[03:30:47.277 --> 03:30:52.280]  He would rather just get the hell out of there to begin with and say, deal with your own mess.
[03:30:52.960 --> 03:30:59.325]  So I think that that's the dynamic difference again between Donald Trump and past presidents that we've had.
[03:30:59.385 --> 03:31:01.246]  Thank you for the call, Cody in Texas.
[03:31:01.606 --> 03:31:03.508]  Hey, could you guys share my screen here real quick?
[03:31:03.548 --> 03:31:04.708]  This is MSNBC.
[03:31:06.286 --> 03:31:07.467]  Okay, let me pull this back up.
[03:31:08.148 --> 03:31:18.556]  MSNBC, we're gonna pull this up for you in a second, is claiming Donald Trump has won in an upset, folks.
[03:31:19.838 --> 03:31:20.838]  It's an upset.
[03:31:22.840 --> 03:31:23.561]  An upset.
[03:31:24.622 --> 03:31:30.467]  It's only an upset to the brainwashed morons who believe MSNBC.
[03:31:33.959 --> 03:31:35.079]  See, this is what I'm telling you.
[03:31:35.119 --> 03:31:46.403]  They have to spin it, because the reality they've been selling you for a year and a half, obviously longer than that, but just based on this election, a year and a half, is complete bullcrap!
[03:31:47.924 --> 03:32:01.229]  So, they tell you it's an upset, because they've been sitting here telling you Clinton's gonna win, Clinton's in the polls, Clinton's leading, it's Clinton, it's Clinton, it's Clinton, completely BSing you the whole time, buying their own nonsense,
[03:32:02.600 --> 03:32:06.302]  Eating the own crap that they're selling to the audience.
[03:32:06.983 --> 03:32:12.926]  And then, of course, when they're wrong, they say, oh, well, it was an upset.
[03:32:15.008 --> 03:32:16.929]  Don't you just love the mainstream news, folks?
[03:32:17.549 --> 03:32:31.018]  These people are complete shills that will say anything to try to maintain their fake ivory tower, their fake establishment status.
[03:32:31.946 --> 03:32:33.187]  Here's Drudge Report.
[03:32:33.247 --> 03:32:34.889]  Trump wins in historic uprising.
[03:32:34.929 --> 03:32:35.889]  That's been up for a while.
[03:32:36.290 --> 03:32:37.291]  Let the people rule.
[03:32:37.331 --> 03:32:41.094]  That's been up since like 9 or 10 o'clock even.
[03:32:41.114 --> 03:32:45.217]  I guess you could say that Drudge was the first one to declare Trump the victor.
[03:32:46.318 --> 03:32:47.640]  Alex Jones was the second.
[03:32:48.695 --> 03:33:02.040]  I came into this office when I got in here at like, what was that, at like 10, with my bottle of champagne, my cigar in my mouth, and Rob Dew shooed me out of the studio, shuffled me out, said, no, not yet, not yet.
[03:33:04.481 --> 03:33:05.582]  So I wasn't able to declare it.
[03:33:05.622 --> 03:33:06.722]  I guess I could have been the first.
[03:33:06.762 --> 03:33:07.522]  Thanks a lot, Rob.
[03:33:07.542 --> 03:33:09.363]  You had to steal that from me, didn't you, Rob?
[03:33:09.943 --> 03:33:11.104]  Wouldn't let me celebrate early.
[03:33:12.119 --> 03:33:13.480]  Had to make me do my diligence.
[03:33:14.201 --> 03:33:19.945]  All right, let's go to Jose Maria in California, a Latino for Trump.
[03:33:21.226 --> 03:33:27.851]  What do you think, Jose, about Van Jones saying that this is a whitelash and completely ignoring the Latino support for Trump?
[03:33:30.493 --> 03:33:40.261]  It's kind of crazy because it's... Well, we the Latinos, I'm Mexican, but we the Latinos love
[03:33:41.084 --> 03:33:41.424]  Love.
[03:33:42.085 --> 03:33:43.986]  Well, many of us love Trump.
[03:33:44.847 --> 03:33:50.391]  The thing is that we Latinos don't, we're not very educated.
[03:33:51.592 --> 03:33:52.693]  Uh, we don't see the future.
[03:33:53.634 --> 03:33:58.237]  We just come here and, uh, to work, uh, not to study.
[03:33:58.277 --> 03:34:02.200]  Most of us just to work, get the money, send it back to Mexico.
[03:34:02.701 --> 03:34:07.204]  And some, some like us, like me, we stay, we bring our families.
[03:34:07.284 --> 03:34:08.885]  We, uh, we see the future.
[03:34:08.985 --> 03:34:09.966]  We buy our houses.
[03:34:10.006 --> 03:34:10.767]  We work hard.
[03:34:11.900 --> 03:34:19.847]  But most of Mexicans and most of Latinos, we don't care about this country, the truth.
[03:34:20.207 --> 03:34:22.369]  Because, I mean, I'm not talking about me.
[03:34:22.749 --> 03:34:24.450]  I said, like, we Latinos.
[03:34:25.471 --> 03:34:31.196]  And because we just we don't care about violence or gangs or terrorism.
[03:34:31.576 --> 03:34:32.457]  We don't care.
[03:34:32.517 --> 03:34:34.739]  And we don't we don't educate ourselves.
[03:34:35.479 --> 03:34:35.800]  We just
[03:34:37.006 --> 03:34:43.870]  Watch Spanish and Latin TV, and we think that that's the truth, but it is not.
[03:34:44.171 --> 03:34:54.697]  You can see right away, I mean, they try to control our minds and keep us down, and most of us stay like that, stay down.
[03:34:55.898 --> 03:35:01.041]  And you can see it right away about the jobs and everything, and illegal immigrants.
[03:35:01.481 --> 03:35:04.223]  You can see that away at the border towns.
[03:35:05.328 --> 03:35:13.952]  Like, you know, San Ysidro, border with Tijuana, and Calexico, and El Centro, border with Mexicali.
[03:35:14.793 --> 03:35:25.338]  Well, in these American towns, there's no jobs because the people, I mean, the illegals cross the border only with a visa.
[03:35:26.454 --> 03:35:29.175]  There's this crazy, there's this crazy dynamic in America where
[03:35:56.462 --> 03:36:04.047]  The obvious issues, the elephant in the room that's right in front of your face gets completely ignored.
[03:36:05.267 --> 03:36:12.532]  And I'm not sure if that's because American citizens want to live in denial over these serious issues or because the mainstream media doesn't cover it.
[03:36:13.604 --> 03:36:25.030]  I always use cancer as an example, or autism, where cancer rates are spiking at astronomical rates, autism is spiking at astronomical rates, but nobody asks why.
[03:36:25.630 --> 03:36:26.550]  Nobody asks why.
[03:36:26.630 --> 03:36:37.896]  Nobody seems to know what the issue is, when obviously there's some issue, like something is causing this, this isn't just natural, but nobody wants to cover it, nobody wants to report on it, nobody asks any questions.
[03:36:38.476 --> 03:36:41.278]  It's the same dynamic, what you talk about with the jobs.
[03:36:41.858 --> 03:36:42.418]  I'm from St.
[03:36:42.438 --> 03:36:42.738]  Louis.
[03:36:42.818 --> 03:36:44.159]  If you go into downtown St.
[03:36:44.179 --> 03:36:51.543]  Louis, there in the city, there's abandoned building after abandoned building after abandoned building.
[03:36:51.763 --> 03:37:00.248]  These are huge buildings, you know, 30, 40 story buildings, manufacturing warehouses, completely abandoned.
[03:37:00.948 --> 03:37:04.431]  Boarded up windows, broken windows, nobody's gone in there in years.
[03:37:05.352 --> 03:37:08.334]  They begged people to try to rehab these buildings.
[03:37:08.834 --> 03:37:09.755]  And it doesn't happen.
[03:37:10.316 --> 03:37:11.597]  But nobody asks why.
[03:37:11.677 --> 03:37:15.660]  Nobody asks why there's all these abandoned buildings in the downtown city area.
[03:37:16.240 --> 03:37:23.947]  Because the manufacturing companies, the manufacturing jobs, have been shipped overseas.
[03:37:24.747 --> 03:37:26.148]  This is what Donald Trump talks about.
[03:37:26.429 --> 03:37:28.750]  This is what Jose talks about, where
[03:37:29.671 --> 03:37:30.672]  You want a job.
[03:37:31.652 --> 03:37:32.812]  You don't want to be homeless.
[03:37:33.373 --> 03:37:34.993]  You don't want to live on food stamps.
[03:37:35.454 --> 03:37:37.154]  You want to have a job.
[03:37:37.214 --> 03:37:39.395]  You want to have something to do.
[03:37:39.816 --> 03:37:43.257]  You want to contribute to the society, to the culture.
[03:37:43.817 --> 03:37:52.181]  And the reason why so many people have become so desperate and pathetic, really, is because they've shipped all the jobs away.
[03:37:52.781 --> 03:37:55.463]  So now you've got this new underclass of poor people
[03:37:56.360 --> 03:37:58.263]  Well now what are we going to do with these poor people, right?
[03:37:58.304 --> 03:38:05.597]  The government, whose fault it is that they're in this situation because they shipped all the jobs out, well now the government has to do something.
[03:38:05.617 --> 03:38:06.138]  So what do they do?
[03:38:06.378 --> 03:38:07.039]  They create these...
[03:38:08.226 --> 03:38:09.526]  Welfare programs.
[03:38:10.007 --> 03:38:13.028]  Now you're on the Democratic plantation, you see?
[03:38:13.308 --> 03:38:24.752]  So now all the inner cities that have been destroyed by Democrats, destroyed by Democrat policies, abandoned buildings everywhere, continue into the collapsing state that they're in.
[03:38:24.792 --> 03:38:27.633]  Very rare for cities to actually be up and coming these days.
[03:38:28.393 --> 03:38:31.854]  Most cities you go to, buildings in downtown area are abandoned.
[03:38:31.994 --> 03:38:32.615]  It's getting worse.
[03:38:32.755 --> 03:38:33.335]  Homeless is up.
[03:38:35.523 --> 03:38:48.596]  But so Donald Trump sees the issue and then has a solution that isn't just giving you a handout, which is only going to make the situation worse because now we're in a serious debt.
[03:38:49.892 --> 03:38:55.835]  So it's the selfish politicians who have made bad, selfish decisions that have put us in this situation.
[03:38:56.476 --> 03:39:08.582]  Then they try to pretend like they're making up for it on the surface by providing these welfare programs to the inner cities that they destroyed by ruining the manufacturing jobs and shipping them overseas.
[03:39:09.583 --> 03:39:12.304]  And I think Donald Trump at least wants to fight this.
[03:39:12.364 --> 03:39:18.508]  Again, I don't know if he can do it himself, but it's funny, if these people understood
[03:39:19.824 --> 03:39:28.127]  That all of those abandoned buildings that used to house thousands and thousands of manufacturing jobs might get back in service and now you might have a job?
[03:39:28.147 --> 03:39:35.570]  You know, maybe if they understood that, they would understand what Trump is talking about and they wouldn't hate him that much.
[03:39:35.650 --> 03:39:38.591]  But then again, maybe these people just want to be on welfare.
[03:39:40.292 --> 03:39:41.532]  Maybe they don't want a job.
[03:39:43.133 --> 03:39:44.394]  I don't, I don't, I don't know.
[03:39:44.494 --> 03:39:47.655]  Maybe that's why they're mad, because Donald Trump's gonna send them back to work.
[03:39:49.687 --> 03:39:51.068]  Perhaps that's the mindset, I don't know.
[03:39:52.229 --> 03:39:55.311]  But that's certainly not the American mindset.
[03:39:55.411 --> 03:40:02.817]  The American mindset was, you know, calloused hands, pick up your bootstraps and let's go to work, let's build a country.
[03:40:03.918 --> 03:40:06.039]  And I think that's the attitude Donald Trump comes on with.
[03:40:06.059 --> 03:40:08.661]  Thank you for the call, Jose Maria.
[03:40:08.701 --> 03:40:11.823]  Let's go to Eliash in Pennsylvania.
[03:40:12.724 --> 03:40:13.625]  Go ahead, Eliash.
[03:40:22.073 --> 03:40:22.893]  Do we have Eliash?
[03:40:26.436 --> 03:40:27.976]  Here guys, I think I see the problem here.
[03:40:28.016 --> 03:40:29.978]  Hey, do you just want me to take control of this, dude?
[03:40:32.819 --> 03:40:33.039]  Okay.
[03:40:33.119 --> 03:40:33.339]  Owen?
[03:40:33.720 --> 03:40:35.161]  Yeah, hey, we got you.
[03:40:35.221 --> 03:40:35.981]  Is it Eliash?
[03:40:37.142 --> 03:40:39.203]  Yeah, Eliash is fine, whatever.
[03:40:39.223 --> 03:40:40.824]  Okay, go ahead.
[03:40:41.644 --> 03:40:45.286]  First of all, I want to say, Owen, you're amazing in the H3LX videos.
[03:40:45.306 --> 03:40:49.789]  A true inspiration for standing up for Trump very early in his whole process.
[03:40:52.449 --> 03:41:02.553]  I thought of this point while I was waiting for my main point of how about Hillary being the first presidential candidate in history to not give a speech after an election.
[03:41:03.933 --> 03:41:21.239]  Completely BS to the people that are following her and that brings me to the point of how do we bring these good people who are so, I guess, misinformed thinking that we just elected some bigot, some racist that they think the world is over.
[03:41:22.188 --> 03:41:28.552]  We want to bring these people obviously to our camp, but they have this mindset of just mis-illusion.
[03:41:28.572 --> 03:41:35.796]  And I'm from New York, I live in Philly, so it's pure liberal my whole life, and they think the world is over.
[03:41:35.816 --> 03:41:42.220]  And I want to start the coming together... Yeah, and you know what's sad?
[03:41:42.401 --> 03:41:47.424]  You know what's sad about that is... Man, it's so...
[03:41:49.082 --> 03:41:55.503]  It's sad because that's the brainwashing, that's the impact of the brainwashing, and they've completely been defeated by it.
[03:41:55.583 --> 03:41:57.604]  They've completely been defeated by the establishment.
[03:41:57.624 --> 03:42:02.525]  That's what the establishment wanted, was to completely defeat them and make them feel hopeless.
[03:42:03.225 --> 03:42:08.986]  And it's sad because they don't even realize this, and it's gonna drag us down.
[03:42:09.066 --> 03:42:12.407]  It's gonna hurt all of us because if we could get these people to
[03:42:14.261 --> 03:42:22.670]  Work with us to help us build a better America, no matter what you think about America's past or whatever, whether it's great, bad, indifferent.
[03:42:24.452 --> 03:42:26.114]  Why don't we all work together now?
[03:42:26.875 --> 03:42:33.042]  We have an opportunity now to all work together to be the change we want to see in this country.
[03:42:33.102 --> 03:42:34.003]  But as you said,
[03:42:35.503 --> 03:42:41.606]  These people are so brainwashed, they already think that this is the end of it, and they've already been defeated.
[03:42:41.626 --> 03:42:58.292]  And so now, again, just like getting Trump into office, we have to deal with these slugs, we have to deal with these obstacles, the dumbed down, brainwashed, defeated now, sheeple of America that are in our way.
[03:42:58.372 --> 03:42:59.113]  It's very sad.
[03:42:59.153 --> 03:42:59.513]  Go ahead.
[03:43:05.196 --> 03:43:13.118]  Alright, I think that we have lost Elias out in Philadelphia.
[03:43:13.138 --> 03:43:34.124]  Oh man, that's really sad because I guess the brainwashed masses are going to continue to be the brainwashed masses and now luckily we were able to trump them and get Trump
[03:43:35.177 --> 03:43:35.938]  Into office.
[03:43:36.940 --> 03:43:46.412]  But now, moving forward, we're gonna have to continue to deal with them slowing us down as we're trying to make America great again, if you will.
[03:43:47.834 --> 03:43:48.535]  And that's what it is.
[03:43:48.595 --> 03:43:49.336]  They're slugs.
[03:43:49.456 --> 03:43:51.659]  They are sloths.
[03:43:54.127 --> 03:43:58.689]  They're like sloths that are grabbing our legs.
[03:43:59.249 --> 03:44:07.133]  We're trying to run a 50-yard dash or whatever, and we've got these sloths that won't let go of our legs.
[03:44:09.534 --> 03:44:10.794]  Trump's a racist.
[03:44:10.854 --> 03:44:11.274]  He won.
[03:44:11.454 --> 03:44:12.075]  We're done.
[03:44:12.535 --> 03:44:14.476]  It's like, no, hey man, get up and run with me.
[03:44:18.217 --> 03:44:19.458]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[03:44:20.905 --> 03:44:24.166]  Alright, let's take another call here.
[03:44:24.246 --> 03:44:27.127]  Let's go to, who's been holding the longest?
[03:44:28.127 --> 03:44:29.948]  Let's go to Eva.
[03:44:29.968 --> 03:44:32.989]  I'm not sure where Eva is.
[03:44:33.029 --> 03:44:33.689]  Go ahead, Eva.
[03:44:33.709 --> 03:44:36.670]  Hello, Owen.
[03:44:36.970 --> 03:44:40.332]  My sister is the one that woke me up to you guys a few years ago.
[03:44:40.632 --> 03:44:41.892]  She actually called yesterday.
[03:44:41.932 --> 03:44:42.692]  Now it's my turn.
[03:44:42.732 --> 03:44:44.253]  I just wanted to make two quick points.
[03:44:44.973 --> 03:44:50.235]  Point number one, the reason Van Jones, and you will find, notice, you will find more anger
[03:44:50.996 --> 03:44:54.598]  From CNN and MSNBC because they have something in common.
[03:44:55.118 --> 03:45:00.981]  They're government funded and now that we have President Trump, the money comes to an end.
[03:45:01.082 --> 03:45:02.842]  No more government funding.
[03:45:03.363 --> 03:45:04.323]  Interesting point.
[03:45:05.004 --> 03:45:08.105]  Yeah, that's why they're pissed off more than all the other networks.
[03:45:08.245 --> 03:45:10.046]  They will be the ones being pissed off.
[03:45:10.146 --> 03:45:16.230]  Now the other point I wanted to make is we need to challenge this BS.
[03:45:17.199 --> 03:45:23.242]  That she has, that Hillary has a popular vote and we're going to do it with, look at the rallies.
[03:45:24.623 --> 03:45:25.963]  You've been to the rallies.
[03:45:26.403 --> 03:45:26.684]  Okay.
[03:45:26.704 --> 03:45:33.827]  You look at the Trump rallies, look at the thousands and thousands of people that show up that look at the mediocre crowd that she would get.
[03:45:34.787 --> 03:45:35.107]  Okay.
[03:45:35.468 --> 03:45:36.728]  So how can it be?
[03:45:36.788 --> 03:45:41.370]  She has the popular vote winning in rallies that did not show it.
[03:45:41.490 --> 03:45:44.632]  And another thing, what we shouldn't back down.
[03:45:45.481 --> 03:45:49.003]  With all the voter fraud that happened.
[03:45:49.083 --> 03:45:50.463]  That should not be let go.
[03:45:50.523 --> 03:45:51.184]  Because you know what?
[03:45:51.544 --> 03:45:52.905]  We had dead people voting.
[03:45:53.565 --> 03:45:56.306]  We had people who legally are not supposed to vote.
[03:45:56.346 --> 03:45:58.988]  There are convicts, you know, that all of a sudden were allowed to vote.
[03:45:59.448 --> 03:46:00.889]  And then we have illegals voting.
[03:46:01.369 --> 03:46:03.410]  So we should not back this up.
[03:46:03.450 --> 03:46:04.170]  Because you know what?
[03:46:04.290 --> 03:46:14.135]  If we do, the media is going to run throughout the entire course of Trump's administration saying that he was never a popular president.
[03:46:17.543 --> 03:46:18.845]  Yeah, I mean, that is interesting.
[03:46:18.985 --> 03:46:21.589]  Obviously, you know, rally turnout
[03:46:22.608 --> 03:46:35.797]  And social media representation was kind of, because I don't trust the polls personally, is kind of how I dictated what I felt about heading into this election, who I thought was going to win, Trump.
[03:46:36.938 --> 03:46:40.980]  But yeah, the electoral vote now, let's see where it stands.
[03:46:42.381 --> 03:46:44.302]  Hillary Clinton, 59 million.
[03:46:45.183 --> 03:46:48.125]  Donald Trump, 58.9 million.
[03:46:48.505 --> 03:46:52.008]  So, you know, it's neck and neck, but Hillary Clinton is going to win the popular vote.
[03:46:52.789 --> 03:46:58.683]  Like I said, I wouldn't be surprised if they're shaving points
[03:46:59.924 --> 03:47:18.789]  In Hillary's favor, in California right now, in order to provide the victory in the popular vote so that they still have something to grasp onto, still have some sort of narrative they can twist in order to either contest this or continue to prop themselves up.
[03:47:19.890 --> 03:47:24.511]  I'm not really sure, but it really is indifferent at this point.
[03:47:25.458 --> 03:47:30.581]  And I'm not sure, you know, what people feel about the Electoral College.
[03:47:30.682 --> 03:47:33.664]  You know, you could make a case, I guess, for or against it.
[03:47:33.724 --> 03:47:36.786]  Obviously, this year, I think most of us would be for it.
[03:47:37.246 --> 03:47:37.906]  But who knows?
[03:47:38.707 --> 03:47:43.650]  You know, who knows what the actual integrity of this election was?
[03:47:44.211 --> 03:47:50.095]  Who knows if these votes were being shaved and point shaving was happening here?
[03:47:50.455 --> 03:47:52.036]  Who knows how many dead people voted?
[03:47:53.897 --> 03:47:57.859]  And even though we're happy with this victory right now, you know, I think you make a good point.
[03:47:58.379 --> 03:48:00.220]  Perhaps we should still be looking into this stuff.
[03:48:00.240 --> 03:48:01.261]  In fact, we definitely should be.
[03:48:01.701 --> 03:48:04.282]  We should still be finding out how many dead people voted.
[03:48:05.423 --> 03:48:08.885]  We should still be looking into the fractional magic with the black box voting machines.
[03:48:10.505 --> 03:48:19.330]  And even though it seems tedious and menial and perhaps, after considering the timing now, a worthless task, it won't be.
[03:48:20.396 --> 03:48:47.111]  It's something that's very important for maintaining the integrity of these elections, which, you know, even though I think the Trump victory is obviously one that is easy to see as legitimate, that doesn't mean that the entire process of this election was fair in the sense that no dead people voted, no illegal immigrants voted,
[03:48:48.217 --> 03:48:55.500]  You know, people didn't vote twice or in two different states, or black box voting didn't use fractional magic to save points.
[03:48:56.120 --> 03:49:02.362]  And my guess is there's a lot of patriots out there who are still going to look into this because no matter who's president, that's just what they do.
[03:49:03.707 --> 03:49:18.056]  Like us at Infowars.com, Bev Harris, but obviously we're on a high ground right now because Donald Trump won and we were all so scared of the steal that just the victory tonight is such a sweet satisfaction.
[03:49:19.297 --> 03:49:24.501]  It's almost like you forget about all the other crap that we have to deal with, at least for the time being.
[03:49:25.421 --> 03:49:26.982]  Thank you for the call, Eva.
[03:49:27.042 --> 03:49:28.523]  Let's now go out to
[03:49:29.872 --> 03:49:31.293]  Let's see who's been holding here.
[03:49:31.353 --> 03:49:32.234]  Let's go to Jack.
[03:49:32.354 --> 03:49:33.275]  What's on your mind, Jack?
[03:49:35.557 --> 03:49:42.242]  Um, I just would like to say that I am really, really, really, uh, pissed at the results of this election.
[03:49:42.623 --> 03:49:52.891]  I was a Hillary Clinton supporter, and I am so shocked about this outcome of the election, and I am really pissed off, and I don't know what to do.
[03:49:52.911 --> 03:49:54.473]  I just don't know what to do.
[03:49:54.893 --> 03:49:55.654]  I'm really pissed.
[03:49:55.854 --> 03:49:56.955]  How old are you, Jack?
[03:49:58.399 --> 03:49:58.559]  I'm 21.
[03:49:59.520 --> 03:49:59.660]  I'm 21.
[03:50:00.380 --> 03:50:01.981]  And you were a Hillary Clinton voter?
[03:50:03.342 --> 03:50:03.563]  Yes.
[03:50:03.983 --> 03:50:04.203]  Yes.
[03:50:04.623 --> 03:50:09.226]  So why are you so upset with the results just because Hillary lost?
[03:50:10.307 --> 03:50:11.988]  Well, no, not just because she lost.
[03:50:12.288 --> 03:50:13.369]  It could have been anyone else.
[03:50:13.549 --> 03:50:15.811]  I mean, it's because of that Donald Trump.
[03:50:16.411 --> 03:50:16.952]  That's the thing.
[03:50:17.472 --> 03:50:17.892]  What's wrong?
[03:50:17.952 --> 03:50:18.313]  What's wrong?
[03:50:18.493 --> 03:50:19.293]  What's wrong with Trump?
[03:50:20.954 --> 03:50:22.756]  Oh, where do I start?
[03:50:23.396 --> 03:50:24.777]  I mean, let's just say that
[03:50:25.543 --> 03:50:29.384]  Not just the comments he made, but the policies he wants to implement.
[03:50:30.104 --> 03:50:31.965]  He doesn't want to raise the minimum wage.
[03:50:32.385 --> 03:50:33.985]  He doesn't want to ban Muslims.
[03:50:34.005 --> 03:50:38.006]  He wants to halt Muslims from coming to this country.
[03:50:38.046 --> 03:50:40.167]  I don't know what to do with this caller, guys.
[03:50:40.207 --> 03:50:41.687]  Are you serious, Jack?
[03:50:41.867 --> 03:50:42.708]  Are you really serious?
[03:50:42.728 --> 03:50:43.928]  Or are you just trying to troll me?
[03:50:43.988 --> 03:50:45.708]  I don't joke about this stuff.
[03:50:45.768 --> 03:50:47.689]  No, I don't joke about this kind of stuff.
[03:50:47.729 --> 03:50:49.089]  This is serious business for me.
[03:50:49.670 --> 03:50:51.390]  Okay, well you realize that you're a joke.
[03:50:56.399 --> 03:50:57.440]  You can say that all you want.
[03:50:57.540 --> 03:51:01.782]  I'm just going to try and find a way to get through all this.
[03:51:02.383 --> 03:51:03.844]  To get through all this stuff.
[03:51:05.104 --> 03:51:05.505]  I don't know.
[03:51:05.985 --> 03:51:11.788]  My question I have is though, he's saying that it's rigged, but he wants.
[03:51:12.068 --> 03:51:14.950]  So is it still rigged, but yet not in his favor?
[03:51:14.970 --> 03:51:17.632]  Now hold on a second.
[03:51:18.072 --> 03:51:21.634]  Your candidate said that Russia was trying to rig this election.
[03:51:23.638 --> 03:51:24.558]  Okay, okay.
[03:51:24.978 --> 03:51:27.779]  Yeah, he says some a lot of crazy things.
[03:51:27.879 --> 03:51:33.581]  I don't agree with everything that he says, but I like her a lot, and I proudly voted for her.
[03:51:33.881 --> 03:51:35.722]  You like Hillary Clinton?
[03:51:36.982 --> 03:51:41.044]  I think she would have been an amazing president, just like Bernie Sanders would have been.
[03:51:41.404 --> 03:51:43.005]  Oh my god.
[03:51:44.885 --> 03:51:45.965]  Oh my god.
[03:51:45.986 --> 03:51:46.966]  What was that, Marcos?
[03:51:49.144 --> 03:51:50.286]  I just feel bad for all my fans.
[03:51:50.346 --> 03:51:52.691]  They're going to call me and they're going to be like, what's going on?
[03:51:52.711 --> 03:51:53.673]  How did this happen?
[03:51:53.733 --> 03:51:58.783]  And except like maybe three people, everyone's going to be calling me and be like, what happened here?
[03:52:00.251 --> 03:52:01.051]  Well, you know what?
[03:52:01.091 --> 03:52:02.332]  I don't know what your deal is, Jack.
[03:52:02.372 --> 03:52:03.192]  Maybe you're a troll.
[03:52:03.252 --> 03:52:04.973]  Maybe you're an actual Hillary Clinton supporter.
[03:52:05.653 --> 03:52:06.353]  But here's the deal.
[03:52:06.853 --> 03:52:07.213]  Here's the deal.
[03:52:07.253 --> 03:52:09.314]  I would suggest you go look into the WikiLeaks.
[03:52:09.474 --> 03:52:11.695]  I would suggest you look into the Clinton Foundation.
[03:52:12.155 --> 03:52:13.315]  Pay-for-play programs.
[03:52:13.576 --> 03:52:14.556]  What they did with Haiti.
[03:52:14.856 --> 03:52:16.857]  I would look into who funds the Clinton Foundation.
[03:52:17.097 --> 03:52:18.137]  Who funds ISIS.
[03:52:18.417 --> 03:52:20.258]  And then see if she's the real candidate of women.
[03:52:20.858 --> 03:52:23.699]  You can look at the cattle futures scam that she ran.
[03:52:24.539 --> 03:52:31.964]  I mean it just goes on and on and on and I think it's a I think you know either you're just a total troll or a total joke.
[03:52:33.385 --> 03:52:35.366]  So I don't know what I don't know what his deal was.
[03:52:35.706 --> 03:52:38.388]  Let's go to I wasn't gonna waste my time with that caller anymore.
[03:52:38.608 --> 03:52:39.969]  Let's go to Michael.
[03:52:40.369 --> 03:52:41.010]  Go ahead Michael.
[03:52:44.432 --> 03:52:49.655]  Hold on I'm getting a little feedback.
[03:52:49.695 --> 03:52:52.737]  Can you turn down your can you turn down the show audio?
[03:52:57.612 --> 03:53:03.315]  Yes, sir.
[03:53:03.475 --> 03:53:03.916]  I'm done.
[03:53:04.016 --> 03:53:04.396]  I'm done.
[03:53:04.516 --> 03:53:05.276]  Okay.
[03:53:05.296 --> 03:53:06.837]  We got too many callers to deal with this.
[03:53:06.857 --> 03:53:07.598]  Here's the deal, folks.
[03:53:08.679 --> 03:53:09.419]  You call in.
[03:53:09.479 --> 03:53:15.523]  We're going to take as many calls as we have, but I'm not going to have any patience for any of this crap anymore because we have too many people trying to call in.
[03:53:16.143 --> 03:53:16.684]  Call in.
[03:53:16.704 --> 03:53:19.366]  You're going to have five minutes or less.
[03:53:19.966 --> 03:53:21.107]  Have your point ready to go.
[03:53:22.455 --> 03:53:23.916]  Don't be on speakerphone.
[03:53:24.056 --> 03:53:26.617]  Have the phone up to your face so that I can hear you.
[03:53:27.197 --> 03:53:31.279]  Don't have the feed going in the background so that I have feedback, okay?
[03:53:31.519 --> 03:53:32.879]  It's very simple stuff.
[03:53:33.340 --> 03:53:38.702]  I'm sorry I had to drop you, but we got way too many people trying to call in to have to deal with that crap.
[03:53:39.362 --> 03:53:43.204]  Alright, let's go to Scott in Ontario.
[03:53:43.244 --> 03:53:43.944]  Go ahead, Scott.
[03:53:44.927 --> 03:53:46.189]  Oh, hi Owen.
[03:53:46.829 --> 03:53:49.733]  First off, I want to commend you and your crew for the work you've done.
[03:53:49.753 --> 03:54:01.527]  I mean, I've spent 11 years working in TV in Canada, and I know the stress and amount of work involved to do even remotely what you've done and are doing.
[03:54:03.109 --> 03:54:09.275]  I'm going to be honest, three months ago I was anti-Trump based on what I was hearing, just hearsay from U.S.
[03:54:09.935 --> 03:54:10.516]  citizens.
[03:54:10.656 --> 03:54:22.927]  The only reason I started looking into this election was the years of television work and training allowed me to easily see the attack ads on Trump were being cut out of context, just like that edited tape.
[03:54:23.487 --> 03:54:27.291]  And after watching your show, when Trump's full speech is, I knew it was nonsense.
[03:54:28.851 --> 03:54:39.033]  I knew Anderson Cooper even tried to set Trump up in the second debate with a question about if he's ever done what he said in the tapes before the fake assault charges were filed.
[03:54:39.694 --> 03:54:44.555]  I was trained by the audio director of a national network to do and detect that type of editing.
[03:54:44.575 --> 03:54:56.017]  It's kind of sad both our countries had a media blackout on the real issues, the real policies, the emails, WikiLeaks, and the clips of Biden, the Chief of Staff,
[03:54:56.846 --> 03:55:05.455]  But making threats or threats to Russia and Russia's warning or Hillary caught lying multiple times by Trey Gowdy.
[03:55:06.896 --> 03:55:16.546]  Although we have some UK news sources, it's been odd since our media isn't partially owned by the military industrial complex, it has been dumping the same narratives on us.
[03:55:17.472 --> 03:55:25.217]  I'm just wondering your opinion on the immigration site to Canada crashing and the possible future of Canada now.
[03:55:26.338 --> 03:55:26.879]  You know what?
[03:55:26.999 --> 03:55:27.499]  I don't know.
[03:55:27.519 --> 03:55:33.243]  That was either because of intense traffic on the website or it could have just been a coincidence.
[03:55:33.403 --> 03:55:34.004]  I don't really know.
[03:55:34.024 --> 03:55:36.525]  I haven't really seen too many stories on that.
[03:55:36.565 --> 03:55:42.489]  But funny enough, I had told the story a bunch of times on air already tonight or this morning.
[03:55:43.570 --> 03:55:54.220]  I have a Canadian friend, she's here on a work visa, and she was legitimately scared she was going to get deported because Trump won.
[03:55:54.260 --> 03:55:55.661]  I explained to her that's not the case.
[03:55:56.262 --> 03:55:59.645]  But she did go to the Canadian immigration site.
[03:55:59.705 --> 03:56:02.528]  She was the one that originally reported to me that it was down.
[03:56:02.568 --> 03:56:03.889]  So it's funny that you talk about that.
[03:56:06.698 --> 03:56:07.218]  You know, I don't know.
[03:56:07.258 --> 03:56:16.886]  As far as the immigration thing is concerned, I think that because of how much tension there is around this topic, not just because of Donald Trump, but because of...
[03:56:18.032 --> 03:56:32.520]  You know, illegal immigration issues, the fact that a lot of these people are being told that they need to come here now because Trump is going to win, so we're having another mass rush of immigrants into the country.
[03:56:33.501 --> 03:56:38.584]  You know Obama is going to try to bring in as many as possible before he gets out of office.
[03:56:40.184 --> 03:56:45.487]  So I think that the issue there is still the same, at least until Trump is inaugurated.
[03:56:45.507 --> 03:56:51.389]  The illegal immigrants are still going to be coming in in droves.
[03:56:51.409 --> 03:56:57.472]  The political establishment is going to try to get as many legal as possible before Trump gets in.
[03:56:58.852 --> 03:57:15.862]  And, you know, they're going to do everything they can to try to flush out and ram home all the policies, the failing policies that Obama planned on Clinton carrying on in her administration.
[03:57:16.122 --> 03:57:20.025]  Obama is now going to have to drop that hammer on all of those himself.
[03:57:20.085 --> 03:57:21.786]  So it's going to be a tough time for Obama.
[03:57:22.748 --> 03:57:25.512]  And I think we're going to continue to see immigrants coming here in droves.
[03:57:26.673 --> 03:57:28.055]  And you made a couple good points there.
[03:57:28.816 --> 03:57:32.481]  First of all, you talked about one thing, and this is kind of off topic, but it's an aspect of life.
[03:57:33.885 --> 03:57:37.087]  That people really need to grasp and understand.
[03:57:37.887 --> 03:57:41.330]  Where you talked about how you could kind of understand what was going on.
[03:57:41.350 --> 03:57:43.911]  You could kind of see what was going on because you work in TV.
[03:57:44.271 --> 03:57:46.873]  So you kind of understand the things and how they operate around here.
[03:57:46.953 --> 03:57:49.995]  You kind of operate, you see how the things are operated in the mainstream news.
[03:57:50.615 --> 03:58:01.002]  That's just a story that resonates for anyone and everyone to me because until you're actually
[03:58:03.752 --> 03:58:11.938]  In the game, like a football analogy, until you're actually in the huddle, until you're actually under center, you don't get it.
[03:58:12.058 --> 03:58:13.198]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:58:13.238 --> 03:58:19.222]  It's like you said, until you're actually in the TV media and you know the behind the scenes stuff, you don't get it.
[03:58:19.643 --> 03:58:33.532]  That's why I always tell people you need to work in the service industry at least one time in your life so that when you go out to eat or when you go out to a restaurant or something like that, you understand the aspects of what they're going through, how they operate,
[03:58:34.192 --> 03:58:35.773]  And that makes you a better customer.
[03:58:35.793 --> 03:58:37.013]  That makes you a better client.
[03:58:37.653 --> 03:58:45.776]  And so it's like, you know, a lawyer, like, you know, until you're a lawyer, you don't understand the backroom dealings of a courtroom or, you know, a legal proceeding or litigation or stuff like that.
[03:58:46.376 --> 03:58:50.797]  You know, until you're in TV or media, you know, there's certain things that you're just not going to understand.
[03:58:50.817 --> 03:58:51.517]  You're not going to get it.
[03:58:51.537 --> 03:58:53.078]  You're not in there witnessing the scene.
[03:58:53.418 --> 03:58:56.659]  But then to someone like you, you've been in there, you've witnessed it.
[03:58:56.699 --> 03:58:57.339]  Like for me, like,
[03:58:58.913 --> 03:59:11.578]  If I'm watching a football game, I worked in a football television truck for three years, just some little thing, a little thing with a graphic or a little thing with a camera change here, that's something I see.
[03:59:11.638 --> 03:59:12.898]  I notice that, like, oh, they messed up.
[03:59:13.158 --> 03:59:14.418]  But the average person has no clue.
[03:59:14.439 --> 03:59:15.199]  They didn't even notice it.
[03:59:15.879 --> 03:59:19.180]  But you talk about being in TV and seeing it.
[03:59:19.280 --> 03:59:21.541]  You can kind of use that analogy, I think, for anything for life.
[03:59:22.021 --> 03:59:27.263]  But so you talked about seeing the propaganda against Trump
[03:59:28.849 --> 03:59:38.118]  Seeing how the television was being used to demonize Trump, and you said you didn't like Trump, but you started to see through the TV propaganda, but maybe you still didn't like Trump.
[03:59:38.859 --> 03:59:47.587]  But then the even more powerful thing that the caller said, Scott from Ontario, was that as soon as you heard Donald Trump speak,
[03:59:48.834 --> 03:59:57.385]  When you actually listened to a Donald Trump speech, that's when you actually began to like Donald Trump.
[03:59:57.465 --> 04:00:02.071]  And I'm curious, how many other people it was like that for?
[04:00:03.834 --> 04:00:04.395]  Were there...
[04:00:05.583 --> 04:00:13.926]  A million Americans in the last two days that for the first time in this election cycle went and actually listened to a Donald Trump speech for the first time?
[04:00:14.426 --> 04:00:20.928]  Because I've always believed that so many of these people that hate Trump have never actually heard a speech.
[04:00:22.268 --> 04:00:25.970]  All they do is they're part of the drive-by media audience.
[04:00:27.270 --> 04:00:32.732]  They'll tune into CNN or whoever and they'll just hear clips from the Donald Trump speech
[04:00:33.757 --> 04:00:37.559]  And they'll use those clips to twist and make Donald Trump look bad.
[04:00:38.619 --> 04:00:46.103]  So then that's what they think Donald Trump is talking about, that's how they think he talks, instead of actually hearing the full speech and understanding the context.
[04:00:47.163 --> 04:00:50.304]  And so that's what you did, and then you ended up liking Trump.
[04:00:50.364 --> 04:01:02.570]  Of course, you're in Ontario, so you're not in a voter here, but I wonder how many Americans that was also true for, where they may have hated Trump, and then they actually went and listened to his speech and changed their mind.
[04:01:04.093 --> 04:01:19.498]  But I guarantee you, it's like either you have never heard Donald Trump speak, or you are too narrow-minded to understand the context and the issues of which he speaks on.
[04:01:20.538 --> 04:01:28.281]  And I think a combination of those two things is what results in a female-aid skrillex, where
[04:01:29.511 --> 04:01:40.740]  You think Donald Trump is so bad that you're going to literally scream at me, I mean, lose control, veins popping out of your neck.
[04:01:41.941 --> 04:01:44.923]  I mean, folks, look, I'm a, I mean, I'm the same way.
[04:01:44.983 --> 04:01:50.427]  I mean, I've been, I've literally been made famous by screaming at people, veins popping out of my neck.
[04:01:50.487 --> 04:01:52.328]  So I'm not sitting here saying that's bad or good or whatever.
[04:01:53.971 --> 04:01:55.814]  And I guess I'm sexist for this comment.
[04:01:56.435 --> 04:01:58.538]  That's just not ladylike behavior, okay?
[04:01:58.899 --> 04:01:59.340]  I'm sorry.
[04:01:59.840 --> 04:02:06.911]  I don't want a crazed, lunatic, batty woman coming at me, screaming, pointing at me like this.
[04:02:06.952 --> 04:02:08.554]  This is a brainwashed fool, folks.
[04:02:09.639 --> 04:02:14.843]  Now, has female aide Skrillex ever actually heard Donald Trump speak?
[04:02:14.963 --> 04:02:16.984]  Has she ever listened to a Donald Trump speech?
[04:02:17.525 --> 04:02:18.305]  I doubt it.
[04:02:19.026 --> 04:02:20.007]  I highly doubt it.
[04:02:20.047 --> 04:02:26.351]  She goes by, she's a drive-by media viewer, and so, but why is she so mad at me?
[04:02:26.992 --> 04:02:28.413]  Why is she so mad at me?
[04:02:28.693 --> 04:02:30.835]  Because that's the brainwashing, folks.
[04:02:31.675 --> 04:02:33.016]  That's the brainwashing.
[04:02:34.337 --> 04:02:35.718]  Drive-by media audience
[04:02:36.909 --> 04:02:37.809]  Trump's a racist.
[04:02:38.529 --> 04:02:39.609]  This guy likes Trump.
[04:02:40.130 --> 04:02:41.370]  He must be a racist.
[04:02:41.750 --> 04:02:43.190]  You're the detriment of America.
[04:02:44.370 --> 04:02:46.811]  That's how the brainwashing works, folks.
[04:02:46.871 --> 04:02:51.952]  This is the circle of propaganda that we are fighting.
[04:02:51.972 --> 04:02:56.353]  6-19 Central Time in Austin, Texas.
[04:02:56.373 --> 04:02:58.253]  7-19 on the East Coast.
[04:02:59.253 --> 04:03:01.814]  And then out in California, 4-19, about to be 4-20.
[04:03:05.209 --> 04:03:11.274]  And we have a caller actually in Portland.
[04:03:11.294 --> 04:03:13.576]  Let's take this caller in Portland and then we'll take a break.
[04:03:14.176 --> 04:03:20.522]  Let's go to Chris who is calling in about the protests in Portland and Salem.
[04:03:20.542 --> 04:03:21.202]  Go ahead, Chris.
[04:03:24.825 --> 04:03:25.426]  How's it going, buddy?
[04:03:25.726 --> 04:03:26.366]  It's going good.
[04:03:26.386 --> 04:03:27.968]  Good.
[04:03:29.015 --> 04:03:29.655]  Democrat.
[04:03:29.935 --> 04:03:31.676]  I'll try to be as organized as possible.
[04:03:31.756 --> 04:03:35.137]  Democrat since 2008, since I hit the voting scene.
[04:03:36.977 --> 04:03:39.538]  First time voting for a Republican president.
[04:03:40.178 --> 04:03:44.359]  I've definitely listened to a couple of his speeches.
[04:03:45.360 --> 04:03:56.643]  Definitely got a totally different impression from actually listening to what he has to say than what the media has tried to ram down our throats.
[04:03:57.441 --> 04:04:00.823]  This is absolutely historic, truly our Brexit.
[04:04:02.384 --> 04:04:07.808]  Portland, Oregon and Salem, Oregon had protests going like all night.
[04:04:08.829 --> 04:04:17.034]  The bratty college students in Oregon State University were protesting even before they called it for Trump.
[04:04:18.375 --> 04:04:22.638]  And then Black Lives Matter and Hands Up Don't Shoot.
[04:04:23.722 --> 04:04:26.403]  Organized the protest in Portland, Oregon.
[04:04:26.423 --> 04:04:33.545]  Yeah, those thugs organized the protest in Portland that is literally just ending.
[04:04:34.565 --> 04:04:40.287]  People are almost getting up for work and those thugs are literally just ending.
[04:04:40.567 --> 04:04:42.547]  So this protest went from like 1 a.m.
[04:04:42.627 --> 04:04:44.528]  to like 3 or 4 a.m.?
[04:04:45.708 --> 04:04:46.828]  It went from about 11 p.m.
[04:04:46.848 --> 04:04:47.208]  to 4 a.m.
[04:04:49.790 --> 04:04:50.170]  Wow.
[04:04:50.250 --> 04:04:55.291]  And it took the cops over two and a half hours to even become involved.
[04:04:56.012 --> 04:04:57.192]  That tends to happen.
[04:04:57.212 --> 04:05:06.194]  Imagine, imagine, imagine, Chris, if these people put that same energy towards school or work or building or creating something.
[04:05:06.214 --> 04:05:07.094]  I mean, you know.
[04:05:08.374 --> 04:05:15.096]  Yeah, it took the cops over two and a half hours, which is kind of typical in my part of the country here.
[04:05:16.376 --> 04:05:18.617]  If Black Lives Matter is involved,
[04:05:19.275 --> 04:05:22.278]  The cops tend to not get involved at all.
[04:05:22.738 --> 04:05:24.499]  Well, that might change.
[04:05:24.580 --> 04:05:25.801]  That might change.
[04:05:27.902 --> 04:05:38.351]  They've dragged dumpsters into the middle of the road, set them on fire, dragged newsstands, those little metal boxes with like the newspapers, set those on fire.
[04:05:38.391 --> 04:05:45.597]  Yeah, you're out here literally destroying property, you're out here rioting, but Trump is the problem.
[04:05:45.637 --> 04:05:46.338]  What a joke!
[04:05:48.339 --> 04:05:53.183]  So I just wanted to congratulate you guys and thank you for the work that you do.
[04:05:53.504 --> 04:05:55.726]  J. Owen Shroyer, Info Champion.
[04:05:56.326 --> 04:05:58.528]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[04:05:59.389 --> 04:06:05.555]  And tell you that I'm a deplorable Democrat from Oregon that voted for Trump.
[04:06:06.615 --> 04:06:07.596]  It's pretty fun, isn't it?
[04:06:09.238 --> 04:06:11.340]  He had a brilliant acceptance speech.
[04:06:11.580 --> 04:06:13.742]  I thought it was really humble for him to say that
[04:06:14.651 --> 04:06:19.054]  Um, he was even reaching out to people that didn't support him and that he needed their help.
[04:06:20.375 --> 04:06:21.436]  Um, I'm awake.
[04:06:21.636 --> 04:06:22.657]  I'm paying attention.
[04:06:22.997 --> 04:06:25.038]  There's people all over my Facebook feed.
[04:06:25.058 --> 04:06:40.629]  Um, I call them Hillary bots that are saying that they can't sleep and that they're afraid for the country and that they think that because they're gay or lesbian or whatever, that they're going to just like get like drugged through the ringer.
[04:06:40.709 --> 04:06:42.950]  But I know that's not going to happen.
[04:06:43.411 --> 04:06:43.531]  And
[04:06:44.540 --> 04:06:47.822]  Their liberal peers are delicious tonight.
[04:06:49.783 --> 04:06:53.205]  And there is an abundance of them, without a doubt, Chris.
[04:06:53.245 --> 04:06:56.326]  Thank you so much for the kind words and the call.

[04:08:21.843 --> 04:08:23.024]  I guarantee you.
[04:08:23.484 --> 04:08:24.364]  I'm Owen Schroeder.
[04:08:24.965 --> 04:08:27.646]  I'm gonna be live till 8 a.m.
[04:08:27.686 --> 04:08:30.327]  here, so I've got another seven, excuse me,
[04:08:31.127 --> 04:08:31.507]  Seven.
[04:08:31.547 --> 04:08:32.588]  I'm already starting to lose it.
[04:08:32.908 --> 04:08:33.509]  Starting to lose it.
[04:08:33.569 --> 04:08:34.990]  I've got another hour and a half.
[04:08:35.310 --> 04:08:36.351]  I'm going to take a little break.
[04:08:36.451 --> 04:08:45.498]  When we come back, more of your phone calls, more excitement, more talking about the future, the past, and everything that is the U.S.
[04:08:45.558 --> 04:08:48.880]  election on the InfoWars 52-hour election broadcast special.
[04:09:01.152 --> 04:09:08.237]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.

[04:09:34.658 --> 04:09:40.623]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[04:10:01.261 --> 04:10:07.445]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[04:10:07.825 --> 04:10:10.707]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[04:10:11.047 --> 04:10:16.230]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[04:10:16.650 --> 04:10:22.634]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[04:10:22.774 --> 04:10:25.896]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[04:10:26.056 --> 04:10:27.497]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[04:10:27.697 --> 04:10:31.841]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[04:10:32.041 --> 04:10:34.904]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[04:10:34.984 --> 04:10:36.566]  It works like an antioxidant.
[04:10:36.646 --> 04:10:39.829]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[04:10:40.109 --> 04:10:42.452]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[04:10:42.712 --> 04:10:43.673]  It's in powder form.

[04:10:46.656 --> 04:10:47.677]  I take this.
[04:10:47.797 --> 04:10:49.078]  This is the product that I take.
[04:10:49.179 --> 04:10:51.160]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[04:10:51.961 --> 04:10:53.602]  We fight the Globals, we fight the New World Order.

[04:11:01.347 --> 04:11:08.771]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[04:11:09.232 --> 04:11:16.876]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[04:11:17.156 --> 04:11:19.238]  As President, I will make it clear.
[04:11:20.118 --> 04:11:24.862]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[04:11:25.422 --> 04:11:30.786]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[04:11:30.846 --> 04:11:33.929]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[04:11:34.409 --> 04:11:37.191]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[04:11:37.251 --> 04:11:39.813]  We came, we saw, he died.
[04:11:42.213 --> 04:11:44.195]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[04:11:44.596 --> 04:11:47.840]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[04:11:48.260 --> 04:11:56.169]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[04:11:58.075 --> 04:11:58.535]  The U.S.
[04:11:58.595 --> 04:12:02.198]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[04:12:02.558 --> 04:12:10.184]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[04:12:10.565 --> 04:12:12.886]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[04:12:13.267 --> 04:12:17.090]  Of course not, because she's... Look, there's a really loud noise.
[04:12:17.530 --> 04:12:21.633]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[04:12:21.653 --> 04:12:23.875]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[04:12:27.714 --> 04:12:32.127]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[04:13:01.750 --> 04:13:03.451]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[04:13:04.051 --> 04:13:05.392]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[04:13:05.632 --> 04:13:09.154]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[04:13:09.514 --> 04:13:17.258]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[04:13:17.458 --> 04:13:22.280]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[04:13:22.440 --> 04:13:27.923]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[04:13:28.243 --> 04:13:35.771]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[04:13:36.011 --> 04:13:40.475]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[04:13:40.735 --> 04:13:46.481]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes.
[04:13:46.601 --> 04:13:49.565]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[04:13:49.766 --> 04:13:53.031]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[04:14:02.507 --> 04:14:05.929]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[04:14:06.289 --> 04:14:13.414]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[04:14:14.014 --> 04:14:22.379]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[04:14:22.659 --> 04:14:26.742]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[04:14:27.062 --> 04:14:31.825]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics, the destroyer of
[04:14:32.245 --> 04:14:32.665]  We're good.
[04:15:00.987 --> 04:15:03.428]  They said in October I'd be dead in six months.
[04:15:05.389 --> 04:15:09.732]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[04:15:10.472 --> 04:15:19.817]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[04:15:19.957 --> 04:15:22.098]  We came, we saw, he died.
[04:15:24.301 --> 04:15:29.142]  The intervention led by NATO to topple Gaddafi has led to a failed state.
[04:15:33.904 --> 04:15:40.946]  Maybe Libya was not perfect under Gaddafi, but it had, even if to some extent, a functioning government, one unified country.
[04:15:41.326 --> 04:15:42.506]  It was a sovereign state.
[04:15:44.027 --> 04:15:50.769]  Libya now has two rival governments, a civil war that has left over 4,000 people dead, and its cities are in ruin.
[04:15:50.929 --> 04:15:51.489]  I don't know.
[04:15:52.469 --> 04:15:57.494]  What happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be?
[04:15:57.854 --> 04:16:02.299]  Women are treated discriminated against in all these countries she took money against.
[04:16:02.659 --> 04:16:06.142]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[04:16:06.202 --> 04:16:07.083]  They're mistreated.
[04:16:07.764 --> 04:16:09.145]  She claims to be their champion.
[04:16:09.445 --> 04:16:10.366]  We led ISIS.
[04:16:11.348 --> 04:16:12.349]  Take this position.
[04:16:13.010 --> 04:16:18.855]  It was Hillary Clinton that she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS.
[04:16:19.155 --> 04:16:30.646]  We had this brilliant idea that we were going to come to Pakistan and create a force of Mujahideen, equip them with stinger missiles and everything else to go after the Soviets inside Afghanistan.
[04:16:31.327 --> 04:16:32.488]  And we were successful.
[04:16:32.548 --> 04:16:34.730]  And this really just is so disgusting.
[04:16:34.830 --> 04:16:41.335]  When Vince Foster left his White House office on that July day in 1993, he told his secretary that he would be back.
[04:16:42.075 --> 04:16:46.098]  But the Deputy White House Counsel and boyhood friend of Bill Clinton never returned.
[04:16:46.439 --> 04:16:49.701]  There has been this urgency to end this.
[04:16:50.182 --> 04:16:53.764]  And, you know, historically that makes no sense.
[04:16:53.944 --> 04:16:58.688]  We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California.
[04:16:58.908 --> 04:17:08.357]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[04:17:08.397 --> 04:17:10.159]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[04:17:10.579 --> 04:17:21.990]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results instead of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades.
[04:17:22.170 --> 04:17:26.977]  Our whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks.
[04:17:27.158 --> 04:17:30.462]  We have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton.
[04:17:30.683 --> 04:17:38.134]  You know, the emails we published show that Hillary Clinton is receiving constant updates about my personal situation.
[04:17:38.274 --> 04:17:43.656]  The latest story was the death of DNC staffer Seth Rich, who was murdered last month in an apparent robbery.
[04:17:44.096 --> 04:17:50.858]  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has hinted that Rich was his source, but has made no further comments about the case.
[04:17:51.218 --> 04:17:53.339]  That murder, we should say, remains unsolved.
[04:17:53.679 --> 04:18:03.782]  There's a 27-year-old that works for the DNC who was shot in the back, murdered just two weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.
[04:18:04.022 --> 04:18:08.368]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[04:18:09.069 --> 04:18:15.597]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[04:18:25.745 --> 04:18:35.355]  Now we are introducing a new t-shirt, which I think folks need to get, telling the real truth about Bill Clinton, who is a serial rapist and an abuser of women.
[04:18:35.475 --> 04:18:39.279]  In another case, it's about groping and fondling and touching against a woman's will.
[04:18:39.419 --> 04:18:39.760]  And rape.
[04:18:39.960 --> 04:18:40.340]  And rape.
[04:18:40.400 --> 04:18:44.585]  Bill rapes them physically, and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[04:18:44.645 --> 04:18:45.265]  He's a rapist.
[04:18:45.826 --> 04:18:46.226]  Absolutely.
[04:18:46.246 --> 04:18:47.568]  He's a public figure, he goes straight to hell.

[04:18:53.469 --> 04:19:13.893]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by InfoWarsLife.com.
[04:19:13.953 --> 04:19:17.034]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[04:19:17.844 --> 04:19:19.665]  And they're also very affordable.
[04:19:19.685 --> 04:19:20.025]  Exactly.
[04:19:20.045 --> 04:19:21.827]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[04:19:21.847 --> 04:19:25.189]  You talk about we're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[04:19:25.229 --> 04:19:26.350]  We've both talked to them.
[04:19:26.690 --> 04:19:35.656]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[04:19:36.536 --> 04:19:37.637]  We refuse to screw people.
[04:19:37.977 --> 04:19:38.938]  We refuse to do that.
[04:19:39.318 --> 04:19:41.360]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[04:19:41.540 --> 04:19:45.182]  I went on what Mother Nature gave us and it's changed my life.
[04:19:45.562 --> 04:19:47.804]  And it's also helped the info war change the
[04:20:05.117 --> 04:20:13.023]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by InfoWarsLife.com.
[04:20:13.083 --> 04:20:16.186]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[04:20:16.974 --> 04:20:18.835]  And they're also very affordable.
[04:20:40.982 --> 04:20:47.705]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[04:20:48.105 --> 04:20:48.865]  It's a win-win.
[04:20:49.345 --> 04:20:55.048]  Infowarslife.com.
[04:20:55.408 --> 04:20:56.428]  BrainForce is here.
[04:20:56.949 --> 04:20:59.230]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[04:20:59.510 --> 04:21:07.313]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[04:21:08.106 --> 04:21:11.689]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[04:21:11.709 --> 04:21:14.050]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[04:21:14.410 --> 04:21:17.913]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[04:21:17.973 --> 04:21:21.095]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[04:21:21.616 --> 04:21:26.399]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[04:21:26.939 --> 04:21:28.781]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[04:21:29.121 --> 04:21:33.564]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[04:21:33.704 --> 04:21:35.705]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[04:21:36.346 --> 04:21:37.807]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[04:21:37.947 --> 04:21:38.207]  Exactly.
[04:21:38.227 --> 04:21:42.029]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[04:21:42.509 --> 04:21:49.392]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com.
[04:21:49.412 --> 04:21:49.853]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[04:21:49.993 --> 04:21:52.554]  You know, I'm sitting here during the break,
[04:22:06.715 --> 04:22:14.659]  Because we had people call in talking earlier about how mad is Hillary Clinton, you know?
[04:22:14.679 --> 04:22:18.741]  Is Hillary Clinton throwing fits right now?
[04:22:18.801 --> 04:22:20.061]  Is she breaking things?
[04:22:21.542 --> 04:22:22.222]  Is she running?
[04:22:22.303 --> 04:22:23.763]  Is she trying to flee the country?
[04:22:24.704 --> 04:22:25.644]  Is she passed out?
[04:22:25.704 --> 04:22:26.625]  Is she in an ambulance?
[04:22:27.445 --> 04:22:31.287]  No, who really knows, but she was not able to give a concession speech tonight.
[04:22:33.217 --> 04:22:37.299]  We're told that she called Donald Trump and conceded over the phone.
[04:22:39.240 --> 04:22:43.743]  If that happened, my guess is she also begged Donald not to send her to jail.
[04:22:45.604 --> 04:22:53.868]  But I was thinking about this because earlier, you know, I didn't think Hillary was that mad.
[04:22:55.209 --> 04:23:02.433]  And I think that was actually part of her plan was the reason why she couldn't give a concession speech
[04:23:04.355 --> 04:23:15.946]  The reason why she didn't go up on that stage in front of the thousands of people she had in New York at the Clinton headquarters tonight to give the speech was because she was so angry.
[04:23:18.249 --> 04:23:20.171]  And I don't know why that hit me during the break.
[04:23:21.252 --> 04:23:22.152]  I was thinking about this.
[04:23:26.232 --> 04:23:38.362]  She was probably so angry, and of course we know, we've talked to the Secret Service folks, we know how Hillary behaves behind closed doors, like a total psychotic demon, like a little child, actually, throwing temper tantrums.
[04:23:39.963 --> 04:23:49.851]  So, even though it's hard to believe that a grown woman, such a dignified woman, so dignified, Hillary Clinton, hmm,
[04:23:52.113 --> 04:24:05.939]  That she would be throwing little temper tantrums like a little girl, but no, we know that she does, and my guess is that is what was going on tonight, and she was so mad, she was so hopped up, that she could not give that concession speech.
[04:24:05.999 --> 04:24:08.740]  So then, I'm just curious, Hillary.
[04:24:08.760 --> 04:24:11.081]  Maybe you're listening right now.
[04:24:13.042 --> 04:24:14.383]  Why are you so mad?
[04:24:15.463 --> 04:24:16.524]  What are you mad at?
[04:24:18.345 --> 04:24:19.165]  Think about it, folks.
[04:24:21.428 --> 04:24:28.331]  Hillary Clinton is probably so ticked off that she could not even give a concession speech.
[04:24:30.392 --> 04:24:31.412]  So what are you mad at?
[04:24:32.152 --> 04:24:40.696]  Are you mad at the fact you're such a corrupt, lying witch that you couldn't get elected?
[04:24:41.736 --> 04:24:42.896]  So are you mad at yourself?
[04:24:43.617 --> 04:24:44.237]  Probably not.
[04:24:46.283 --> 04:24:48.264]  Are you mad at the American public?
[04:24:48.825 --> 04:24:51.067]  That you thought you had under your thumb?
[04:24:51.127 --> 04:24:55.209]  That you thought you had enslaved their minds?
[04:24:55.250 --> 04:24:56.190]  Their thought process?
[04:24:56.610 --> 04:24:57.791]  That you could get them to vote for you?
[04:24:58.532 --> 04:25:00.713]  Use the media to make Trump look so bad?
[04:25:00.894 --> 04:25:01.694]  To get you elected?
[04:25:02.815 --> 04:25:04.096]  Is that why you're mad, Hillary?
[04:25:04.676 --> 04:25:06.658]  At the American people that you thought you owned?
[04:25:06.678 --> 04:25:08.759]  The American people you thought you controlled?
[04:25:09.280 --> 04:25:10.360]  Is that why you're so mad?
[04:25:10.420 --> 04:25:12.282]  Because they didn't do what you told them to do?
[04:25:14.124 --> 04:25:16.166]  That's the sick, psychotic freak that she is.
[04:25:16.786 --> 04:25:20.529]  Or maybe she's mad at the mainstream media.
[04:25:21.650 --> 04:25:23.692]  Maybe that's who's gonna catch the lash.
[04:25:25.033 --> 04:25:30.097]  It was the mainstream media's fault because they didn't demonize Trump enough.
[04:25:30.697 --> 04:25:42.547]  They did not do enough to make Trump look as bad as they could in order to send the worst possible candidate, Hillary Clinton, to the office.
[04:25:44.326 --> 04:25:46.009]  I mean, I'm trying to think who could be worse.
[04:25:46.169 --> 04:25:47.492]  Maybe like a Harry Reid?
[04:25:47.512 --> 04:25:51.419]  I mean, she's got to be the worst candidate possible.
[04:25:53.649 --> 04:25:57.052]  So is she mad at the American people that she thinks that she's in charge of?
[04:25:57.072 --> 04:26:03.999]  Is she mad at the mainstream news because they did not do enough to Donald Trump in this election cycle?
[04:26:04.459 --> 04:26:05.560]  Who's getting the lash?
[04:26:06.181 --> 04:26:09.664]  Maybe she's mad at the voting machines.
[04:26:10.004 --> 04:26:12.667]  Maybe she's mad at the people who programmed the voting machines.
[04:26:12.707 --> 04:26:17.331]  They didn't do a good enough job shaving enough points to get her elected.
[04:26:17.371 --> 04:26:18.172]  So I'm not sure.
[04:26:19.380 --> 04:26:26.104]  Who is receiving the lash of Hillary Clinton's anger with this loss that she took?
[04:26:28.205 --> 04:26:33.168]  But, um, I think that's why she couldn't give her concession speech, is because she was so angry.
[04:26:34.268 --> 04:26:39.971]  And I think it was a, I mean, for her, probably a good move to not take the stage.
[04:26:41.252 --> 04:26:44.694]  Because she's taken the stage under extreme circumstances before.
[04:26:46.803 --> 04:26:55.709]  But she chose not to tonight, giving a big fat middle finger to her constituents that went out to support her by the thousands in New York tonight.
[04:26:56.069 --> 04:26:56.509]  That's nice.
[04:26:56.549 --> 04:26:57.110]  Isn't that nice?
[04:26:57.610 --> 04:27:03.294]  She took a nice crap on her supporters the eve that she lost the election.
[04:27:03.334 --> 04:27:05.276]  That's how much she cares about her constituents, folks.
[04:27:05.296 --> 04:27:06.436]  She can't even address you.
[04:27:07.237 --> 04:27:08.458]  She's such a selfish pig.
[04:27:11.451 --> 04:27:12.552]  She thought this was hers.
[04:27:12.892 --> 04:27:14.472]  She was entitled to this election.
[04:27:15.113 --> 04:27:15.893]  She didn't get it.
[04:27:15.993 --> 04:27:17.234]  She threw a temper tantrum.
[04:27:18.094 --> 04:27:22.456]  And then could care less about her constituents who went to see her by the thousands in New York.
[04:27:23.117 --> 04:27:24.797]  Leaves the building without addressing them.
[04:27:26.058 --> 04:27:27.279]  Probably in a fit of rage.
[04:27:28.519 --> 04:27:29.760]  Probably had to be sedated.
[04:27:32.221 --> 04:27:33.662]  And I wonder who caught the lash.
[04:27:33.862 --> 04:27:34.862]  Mainstream media?
[04:27:35.803 --> 04:27:36.603]  Secret Service?
[04:27:36.903 --> 04:27:37.443]  Herself?
[04:27:38.104 --> 04:27:39.324]  The American public, maybe?
[04:27:39.344 --> 04:27:40.345]  The voting machines?
[04:27:41.616 --> 04:27:43.958]  Who is Hillary the most ticked at today?
[04:27:44.118 --> 04:27:45.800]  That crazy, psychotic wish.
[04:27:45.940 --> 04:27:49.103]  You know what's going on in her head.
[04:27:49.223 --> 04:27:50.284]  She is ticked off.
[04:27:51.965 --> 04:27:53.326]  This was her presidency.
[04:27:54.647 --> 04:27:55.688]  Bill Clinton even said it.
[04:27:55.829 --> 04:27:56.329]  It's hers.
[04:27:56.489 --> 04:27:57.230]  She deserves it.
[04:27:57.370 --> 04:27:58.611]  She's the one that's been fighting.
[04:27:58.891 --> 04:28:00.132]  She's the one that's been in government.
[04:28:00.833 --> 04:28:06.298]  Hillary Clinton has felt entitled for this position for eight years since Obama defeated her.
[04:28:08.447 --> 04:28:10.267]  She had the mainstream media demonizing Trump.
[04:28:10.447 --> 04:28:11.207]  They didn't do enough.
[04:28:11.308 --> 04:28:13.288]  She had rigged voting machines, shaving points.
[04:28:13.488 --> 04:28:14.328]  They didn't do enough.
[04:28:14.728 --> 04:28:17.589]  She had the brainwashed sheeple that she thought she controlled.
[04:28:18.109 --> 04:28:19.169]  They weren't enough.
[04:28:20.689 --> 04:28:25.490]  So a lot of people are going to receive the lash of Hillary Clinton, I think, today.
[04:28:26.590 --> 04:28:27.150]  But we'll see.
[04:28:27.190 --> 04:28:31.071]  We haven't really gotten anything from the Clinton camp at all.
[04:28:33.411 --> 04:28:36.432]  Except Podesta saying she's not going to give a concession speech.
[04:28:38.757 --> 04:28:42.418]  And that she allegedly called Donald Trump and conceded over the phone.
[04:28:43.819 --> 04:28:50.022]  Now it's interesting, as we're in the break, I'm hearing all the ads, right?
[04:28:50.322 --> 04:28:52.242]  All of the ads that we had playing.
[04:28:53.263 --> 04:28:54.944]  They're like all election related, right?
[04:28:57.204 --> 04:29:06.048]  And it reminded me how we've been in this election process for a year and a half now.
[04:29:07.449 --> 04:29:08.369]  Almost a year and a half.
[04:29:10.914 --> 04:29:14.975]  And it's basically a part of our life.
[04:29:17.356 --> 04:29:29.440]  You know, if you think about it, think about if you date a girl, or if you're a girl, you date a guy, or whatever it is, or let's say you have a pet, and you date, let's say you date, let's say I date a girl for a year and a half, okay?
[04:29:29.540 --> 04:29:30.901]  She's part of my life, right?
[04:29:31.741 --> 04:29:33.982]  Let's say I have a dog for a year and a half.
[04:29:34.022 --> 04:29:34.962]  He's part of my life.
[04:29:36.018 --> 04:29:38.019]  The election has been a part of our life.
[04:29:38.079 --> 04:29:43.281]  It's been ingrained in our everyday life when we wake up, when we go to sleep, when we eat.
[04:29:44.722 --> 04:29:45.842]  It's always been there.
[04:29:46.362 --> 04:29:47.743]  And now it's over.
[04:29:47.823 --> 04:29:48.763]  Now it's gone.
[04:29:49.584 --> 04:29:51.804]  So where do we go from here?
[04:29:51.985 --> 04:29:53.825]  What fills that void?
[04:29:56.526 --> 04:29:57.167]  Will there be...
[04:29:59.141 --> 04:30:05.605]  Will there be some sort of a emotional response here from the American people that the election is finally over?
[04:30:05.986 --> 04:30:07.567]  A sigh of relief?
[04:30:08.187 --> 04:30:09.488]  Maybe some people will miss it?
[04:30:11.669 --> 04:30:18.694]  But this is something that's been a part of our life now for almost a year and a half, and it's now over with, and this is a big void to fill.
[04:30:20.461 --> 04:30:32.465]  For us at Infowars, we're going to go back to doing what we have been doing for years, and we're going to continue to fight the corruption that expands just beyond the presidency.
[04:30:33.206 --> 04:30:38.227]  But we do have to continue to be vigilant before and after Trump gets inaugurated.
[04:30:41.068 --> 04:30:44.770]  But, you know, we'll go back, we'll look at the vaccines, you know, the chemtrails.
[04:30:47.421 --> 04:30:55.365]  Fluoride in the water, I mean there's always that stuff, but it's just weird to think, what is going to fill that void?
[04:30:55.525 --> 04:31:03.188]  So much energy, so much time, so much intent, so much focus, and it's over with.
[04:31:04.649 --> 04:31:05.469]  The election's over with.
[04:31:08.278 --> 04:31:09.019]  So, I don't know.
[04:31:09.439 --> 04:31:13.402]  It'll be interesting to see, because it's not just us, it's everyone, right?
[04:31:13.842 --> 04:31:17.264]  You know, it's every news source, every radio station, everywhere.
[04:31:18.265 --> 04:31:21.087]  The election has been central.
[04:31:22.248 --> 04:31:24.929]  And now that it's over with, what fills that void?
[04:31:26.530 --> 04:31:29.673]  Where is the next trend in media?
[04:31:31.274 --> 04:31:36.097]  Especially considering that the mainstream media has failed miserably.
[04:31:37.506 --> 04:31:39.507]  None of them told you Trump was gonna win, folks.
[04:31:40.568 --> 04:31:41.189]  None of them.
[04:31:41.809 --> 04:31:47.533]  Not Fox, not CNN, not MSNBC, not ABC, not CBS, not NBC.
[04:31:48.693 --> 04:31:49.114]  None of them.
[04:31:50.575 --> 04:31:53.497]  Not a single one.
[04:31:55.238 --> 04:31:56.378]  So where do they go from here?
[04:31:58.680 --> 04:32:04.544]  And they try to save their own skin by twisting it
[04:32:05.600 --> 04:32:06.862]  And saying, shocking!
[04:32:08.205 --> 04:32:08.646]  Upset!
[04:32:08.886 --> 04:32:09.768]  Underdog Trump!
[04:32:09.968 --> 04:32:10.950]  No one expected it!
[04:32:11.731 --> 04:32:15.338]  To try to cover for themselves, because they were completely wrong.
[04:32:18.717 --> 04:32:21.579]  How much gravity does the mainstream media still have?
[04:32:22.399 --> 04:32:23.820]  How much pull?
[04:32:23.920 --> 04:32:25.000]  How much control?
[04:32:25.821 --> 04:32:27.122]  Do they still control the narrative?
[04:32:27.142 --> 04:32:29.583]  Does anybody trust them anymore at all?
[04:32:30.143 --> 04:32:36.667]  Are they now... Did they go from 90% of a joke to now 100% of a joke?
[04:32:38.848 --> 04:32:39.928]  And where do they go from here?
[04:32:41.749 --> 04:32:42.710]  Where do we go from here?
[04:32:45.310 --> 04:32:50.633]  As I said, the election's been part of our life, and it is now in the past.
[04:32:50.853 --> 04:32:51.394]  Or is it?
[04:32:51.514 --> 04:32:53.375]  Maybe they still think they're gonna contest this.
[04:32:55.296 --> 04:32:56.837]  They do have the popular vote.
[04:32:58.217 --> 04:33:00.899]  It looks like by a couple hundred thousand right now.
[04:33:03.781 --> 04:33:08.183]  I'm not sure how much we're still waiting on here.
[04:33:08.203 --> 04:33:10.204]  We've got 93% in in California.
[04:33:13.838 --> 04:33:14.659]  I'm trying to see.
[04:33:14.679 --> 04:33:17.740]  We've still got some in Arizona still needs to be reported.
[04:33:17.940 --> 04:33:19.521]  Utah is still waiting on a lot.
[04:33:20.242 --> 04:33:20.822]  Colorado, 87%.
[04:33:24.064 --> 04:33:25.424]  Montana is almost complete.
[04:33:25.584 --> 04:33:26.585]  Idaho almost complete.
[04:33:26.765 --> 04:33:28.486]  Oregon, 91%.
[04:33:29.506 --> 04:33:30.267]  Washington, 65%.
[04:33:30.407 --> 04:33:33.088]  So still a lot coming in there.
[04:33:33.108 --> 04:33:39.232]  I'm just trying to see if there's anywhere else that still might have an impact.
[04:33:40.345 --> 04:33:42.386]  On the popular vote.
[04:33:42.426 --> 04:33:45.268]  Nebraska, is that 96% there, I think?
[04:33:45.288 --> 04:33:47.649]  Yeah, that's 96%.
[04:33:49.130 --> 04:33:52.052]  So for the most part, the votes are pretty much tallied.
[04:33:52.192 --> 04:34:02.518]  And the weird thing to me is... It appears, at least right now,
[04:34:04.226 --> 04:34:15.152]  That the record voter turnout we were expecting, the record voter registration that we were expecting, um, might not have been as record as we thought.
[04:34:16.212 --> 04:34:32.061]  Or, I guess, I mean, how is that possible that we had record lines in the polls, records of people registering to vote, but yet, where we stand right now, I'm not sure if the record turnout is going to be much more than what we had in the last presidential election.
[04:34:34.781 --> 04:34:42.283]  Let me see if I can get these totals again for last year's election.
[04:34:42.303 --> 04:34:49.485]  59.1 million for Romney, 62.6 million for Obama.
[04:34:52.346 --> 04:34:57.788]  So basically, there's 3 million votes out there.
[04:34:57.808 --> 04:35:01.429]  Around 3 million votes out there.
[04:35:02.597 --> 04:35:08.479]  That would mean we had the same number of voters as the 2012 election.
[04:35:08.499 --> 04:35:14.421]  Or I guess they're actually, I guess I'm not even taking into account third party candidates either.
[04:35:14.461 --> 04:35:17.082]  So I'm terribly forgetting that.
[04:35:17.162 --> 04:35:22.824]  So I guess maybe you had more voters for third party candidates in this election.
[04:35:22.884 --> 04:35:26.906]  Maybe that's where the record voter turnout ended up going.
[04:35:27.506 --> 04:35:30.807]  Because it's definitely not with Trump or Hillary.
[04:35:32.847 --> 04:35:41.114]  In fact, right now, Trump is actually behind Romney by 200,000.
[04:35:45.157 --> 04:35:51.042]  I would expect by the end of the night that that won't be the case, but very interesting.
[04:35:52.043 --> 04:35:53.224]  We'll have to keep an eye on that.
[04:35:53.964 --> 04:35:55.065]  And what does that point to?
[04:35:55.125 --> 04:35:55.786]  What does that mean?
[04:35:58.425 --> 04:36:01.207]  Does that mean that there was some election rigging going on?
[04:36:01.647 --> 04:36:15.354]  Or perhaps that means that the dead voters, illegal voters, and all that, all those shenanigans, perhaps maybe they did not take place in this election, and that's why we don't see the record number of voter turnout that we expected.
[04:36:16.455 --> 04:36:17.235]  So I'm not sure about that.
[04:36:17.255 --> 04:36:18.156]  We'll keep our eye on that.
[04:36:20.452 --> 04:36:23.234]  We'll see where we go from here, what fills the void of the election.
[04:36:24.214 --> 04:36:35.760]  We'll see who receives the lash of Hillary Clinton, who receives the anger, who gets the brute end of that anger that we know is spewing right now from Hillary Clinton.
[04:36:36.901 --> 04:36:44.065]  And these are all the types of things I think are going to be developing today, the day after Donald Trump.
[04:36:45.273 --> 04:36:52.134]  Has been elected the President of the United States, even though the mainstream media told you it couldn't ever happen, folks.
[04:36:52.834 --> 04:36:53.734]  And you know, think about it.
[04:36:55.175 --> 04:37:06.477]  If it wasn't for Infowars.com, if it wasn't for Drudge Report, they could have just, they could have literally stolen this entire election and you would have no idea.
[04:37:08.817 --> 04:37:09.637]  You see how that works?
[04:37:12.958 --> 04:37:13.978]  You see how important we are?
[04:37:15.267 --> 04:37:17.049]  And I don't mean we here at Infowars.com.
[04:37:17.089 --> 04:37:22.413]  I mean we, as in yes, the people here at Infowars.com, but you, the Info Warrior.
[04:37:24.335 --> 04:37:26.597]  You, we the vigilant.
[04:37:27.437 --> 04:37:28.078]  We the people.
[04:37:30.260 --> 04:37:41.870]  Folks, they would have just stolen this thing without a question in the book with the mainstream media and the crooked politicians and the rigged voting machines.
[04:37:43.055 --> 04:37:52.397]  And if there was nobody reporting on it, nobody looking into it, no judge, no InfoWars, no We The People, it would have been given to Hillary Clinton.
[04:37:53.277 --> 04:37:55.097]  No doubt about it.
[04:37:57.878 --> 04:38:02.499]  Because why else would the mainstream news... Zero!
[04:38:02.519 --> 04:38:05.919]  0 for 0, 0 for 100, 0 forever!
[04:38:06.279 --> 04:38:07.480]  That's what the mainstream news is.
[04:38:07.520 --> 04:38:09.620]  They are 0 for forever.
[04:38:12.110 --> 04:38:12.931]  Completely wrong.
[04:38:13.491 --> 04:38:14.712]  Told you that this was Hillary's.
[04:38:14.892 --> 04:38:15.872]  All the polls, folks.
[04:38:16.313 --> 04:38:17.073]  All the polls!
[04:38:19.534 --> 04:38:21.896]  This is something that should never be forgotten.
[04:38:21.916 --> 04:38:28.460]  This is something that we should never let live down.
[04:38:30.561 --> 04:38:31.462]  The polls, folks.
[04:38:31.702 --> 04:38:33.483]  The fake polls.
[04:38:35.546 --> 04:38:46.490]  And let's remember, too, all the people that said that Donald Trump was a conspiracy theorist because he didn't trust the polls, all the people that said we were conspiracy theorists because the polls were rigged, even though we knew it.
[04:38:46.511 --> 04:38:49.772]  Well, where are your polls now?
[04:38:51.072 --> 04:38:57.095]  Hillary Clinton was up by as much as 15 to 20 points in some of your quote-unquote polls.
[04:38:59.016 --> 04:39:04.558]  But yet, this election was decided, uh, what?
[04:39:05.748 --> 04:39:08.109]  Probably by midnight, Central Time.
[04:39:10.930 --> 04:39:12.930]  So we can never forget about this, folks.
[04:39:13.190 --> 04:39:20.813]  We can never forget about how they tried to steal this election from Trump with the mainstream media and their fake polls.
[04:39:24.714 --> 04:39:33.357]  And I'm curious if MSNBC, ABC, Fox, CNN, NBC, CBS, all of these people
[04:39:34.520 --> 04:39:38.122]  I'm curious if they're going to come out and address these polls.
[04:39:38.262 --> 04:39:43.085]  Do you think they're going to do a segment on CNN or Fox talking about, what happened to our polls?
[04:39:43.205 --> 04:39:44.206]  We had these polls.
[04:39:44.266 --> 04:39:45.727]  It was Hillary and all the polls.
[04:39:45.767 --> 04:39:47.248]  Hillary was winning all the polls.
[04:39:47.508 --> 04:39:48.608]  How did Trump win?
[04:39:48.929 --> 04:39:50.209]  What is going on here?
[04:39:51.470 --> 04:39:53.972]  We all thought Hillary was going to win and then Trump won.
[04:39:55.512 --> 04:39:56.693]  No, they're not going to talk like that.
[04:39:56.733 --> 04:39:59.935]  Instead, it's going to be like, shocking upset.
[04:39:59.995 --> 04:40:00.996]  Nobody saw it coming.
[04:40:01.056 --> 04:40:01.976]  This is unbelievable.
[04:40:02.036 --> 04:40:02.317]  Wow.
[04:40:04.696 --> 04:40:05.136]  Not true.
[04:40:05.196 --> 04:40:07.337]  We saw it coming right here at InfoWars.com.
[04:40:08.617 --> 04:40:13.999]  I predicted a Trump victory a year ago on my podcast.
[04:40:14.079 --> 04:40:14.719]  I remember this.
[04:40:15.439 --> 04:40:16.659]  And people thinking I was nuts.
[04:40:17.140 --> 04:40:21.761]  I remember at Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners telling you Trump will be the president and people thinking I was nuts.
[04:40:22.161 --> 04:40:22.941]  Look at the polls!
[04:40:23.221 --> 04:40:24.021]  Look at the polls!
[04:40:24.262 --> 04:40:25.102]  Look at the polls!
[04:40:26.182 --> 04:40:27.242]  The rigged polls, folks.
[04:40:27.422 --> 04:40:28.083]  The rigged polls.
[04:40:30.950 --> 04:40:35.031]  Will the rigged polls be a dead operation of the mainstream news?
[04:40:36.631 --> 04:40:49.113]  Will they continue in the next election process to try to skew the optics of what's actually happening with the election, with their rigged polls?
[04:40:52.334 --> 04:40:53.534]  Because the rigged polls failed.
[04:40:54.974 --> 04:41:00.175]  They were inaccurate, they were rigged, as we told you, and Trump won, as we told you.
[04:41:02.199 --> 04:41:09.065]  So will they continue in the next election cycle to try to propagate a false narrative with rigged polls?
[04:41:09.445 --> 04:41:10.246]  I told you, folks.
[04:41:10.626 --> 04:41:11.167]  We told you.
[04:41:11.427 --> 04:41:11.707]  Okay?
[04:41:12.008 --> 04:41:14.510]  Alex Jones told you the polls were rigged.
[04:41:15.170 --> 04:41:15.491]  Again.
[04:41:17.292 --> 04:41:17.612]  Ofer.
[04:41:18.173 --> 04:41:18.994]  The mainstream news.
[04:41:19.854 --> 04:41:20.115]  Ofer.
[04:41:21.187 --> 04:41:24.610]  Zero of them, not one, predicted Trump would win.
[04:41:25.150 --> 04:41:26.491]  Not one.
[04:41:27.172 --> 04:41:28.192]  DrudgeReport.com?
[04:41:28.733 --> 04:41:29.613]  Predicted Trump would win.
[04:41:29.633 --> 04:41:30.314]  First to announce it.
[04:41:30.614 --> 04:41:31.535]  Infowars.com?
[04:41:31.935 --> 04:41:32.856]  Told you Trump would win.
[04:41:33.636 --> 04:41:34.417]  Second to announce it.

[04:41:48.207 --> 04:41:49.108]  They failed, folks.
[04:41:49.748 --> 04:41:50.289]  They failed.
[04:41:51.783 --> 04:41:52.924]  Hillary failed.
[04:41:53.224 --> 04:41:54.486]  Obama failed.
[04:41:55.046 --> 04:41:55.847]  This is beautiful.
[04:41:55.887 --> 04:41:57.088]  They are the failures.
[04:41:57.308 --> 04:41:59.510]  They are the failures that we always knew they were.
[04:41:59.530 --> 04:42:15.405]  And today is the day for we the people to feel empowered that the liars, cheaters, and the corrupt establishment failed, folks.
[04:42:16.485 --> 04:42:18.987]  That is rue the day, folks.
[04:42:19.507 --> 04:42:24.691]  Rue the day, because today is the day the establishment went ofer.
[04:42:25.592 --> 04:42:27.974]  And we the people won the day.
[04:42:28.354 --> 04:42:30.516]  Let's go back out to the phone lines.
[04:42:31.997 --> 04:42:35.059]  Let's go to... Who's been holding the longest here?
[04:42:35.200 --> 04:42:40.744]  It looks like... Let's go to Jacob in Oklahoma.
[04:42:41.625 --> 04:42:43.886]  I'm sorry, we got to... Okay, Jacob in Oklahoma.
[04:42:43.926 --> 04:42:44.527]  Go ahead, Jacob.
[04:42:46.598 --> 04:42:48.078]  Hi Owen, how you doing?
[04:42:48.378 --> 04:42:49.039]  I'm doing alright.
[04:42:49.259 --> 04:42:49.919]  Thanks for calling.
[04:42:50.899 --> 04:42:56.500]  Hey, I'd just like to start off by saying thanks and congratulations to the entire team there at InfoWars.
[04:42:56.520 --> 04:43:12.084]  Y'all have really been one of the main groups at the forefront of keeping everything at the forefront of the mainstream media, forcing it into the mainstream media, forcing them to basically have no choice but to cover these stories.
[04:43:12.754 --> 04:43:15.195]  And kind of move away from their narrative and their agenda.
[04:43:15.636 --> 04:43:16.896]  But you know what's funny, Jacob?
[04:43:16.916 --> 04:43:17.537]  You know what's funny?
[04:43:17.917 --> 04:43:19.418]  They still ignored the stories.
[04:43:19.758 --> 04:43:21.319]  They still stuck to their narrative.
[04:43:21.659 --> 04:43:26.502]  And here they are, November 9th, total failures, total losers.
[04:43:27.863 --> 04:43:29.083]  Yeah, they're losers alright.
[04:43:29.123 --> 04:43:35.767]  And they're gonna be feeling the pain of that in the coming years.
[04:43:35.787 --> 04:43:39.029]  And a lot of people have woken up and realized that
[04:43:40.492 --> 04:43:44.953]  The mainstream media's credibility is just, I mean, it's absolutely obliterated.
[04:43:44.993 --> 04:43:55.715]  I mean, all the stuff that they've been involved with, and then you've got all these WikiLeaks emails that come out and show collusion between the mainstream press or mainstream media and Hillary Clinton.
[04:43:55.735 --> 04:44:00.916]  You know, CNN is basically a subsidiary of Hillary Clinton and her campaign.
[04:44:03.337 --> 04:44:04.877]  But I just wanted to say a couple things.
[04:44:04.897 --> 04:44:07.498]  You know, it's funny, I hadn't watched that video about the
[04:44:09.264 --> 04:44:09.804]  Yeah.
[04:44:09.925 --> 04:44:11.946]  It's the hearsay mafia.
[04:44:38.807 --> 04:44:48.494]  10 full hat wearers and conspiracy theorists by the same people that watch TV to get their news and information.
[04:44:49.695 --> 04:44:51.196]  Yeah.
[04:44:51.296 --> 04:44:53.698]  And they're not even absorbing anything when they're watching.
[04:44:53.938 --> 04:44:56.880]  They're just the drive-by media audience.
[04:44:56.920 --> 04:44:57.120]  Yeah.
[04:44:57.541 --> 04:44:57.801]  Yeah.
[04:44:58.341 --> 04:45:03.525]  They're like kind of in a zombified state where they're only catching, you know, the key words.
[04:45:05.166 --> 04:45:07.548]  Anybody that knows anything about basic psychology knows that they're
[04:45:08.167 --> 04:45:08.808]  I don't think so.
[04:45:36.482 --> 04:45:42.884]  You know, we had a serious victory here in this nation with him winning the election.
[04:45:42.904 --> 04:45:57.847]  What do you think the possibility is of some sort of, you know, false flag shenanigans or something like that, the possibility of the establishment trying something to remain in power?
[04:45:57.887 --> 04:45:59.928]  Because, I mean, let's be honest, people that are behind
[04:46:00.663 --> 04:46:05.666]  Hillary Clinton and this entire campaign and globalist, elitist movement.
[04:46:05.906 --> 04:46:08.968]  I mean, these people have spent millions, hundreds of millions of dollars.
[04:46:09.308 --> 04:46:13.310]  She's received hundreds of millions of dollars from Qatar, Saudi Arabia.
[04:46:13.410 --> 04:46:23.235]  I mean, all these nations and all these people, the Rockefellers, George Soros, all these people, you know, they spent all this money on her.
[04:46:24.156 --> 04:46:29.879]  And I'm curious as to how they're going to react whenever she didn't deliver.
[04:46:30.845 --> 04:46:36.086]  You know, it's funny that you talk about that, and thank you so much for the call, Jacob.
[04:46:36.766 --> 04:46:41.647]  In a way, Hillary Clinton was kind of the false flag to remain in power.
[04:46:41.667 --> 04:46:43.468]  I mean, think about it, folks.
[04:46:43.508 --> 04:46:46.708]  Hillary Clinton, totally unfit to be president.
[04:46:46.828 --> 04:46:48.309]  So much corruption behind her.
[04:46:49.049 --> 04:46:50.269]  Totally unfit to be president.
[04:46:50.389 --> 04:46:51.309]  Not even healthy!
[04:46:51.769 --> 04:46:52.910]  Not even healthy!
[04:46:52.930 --> 04:46:53.970]  You know?
[04:46:54.410 --> 04:46:55.490]  Totally unfit to be president.
[04:46:55.850 --> 04:46:59.871]  Couldn't even beat Bernie Sanders in the primary, except the fact it was rigged.
[04:47:00.936 --> 04:47:08.040]  So, if you think about it, Hillary Clinton was kind of the false flag to stay in power because she was never a real candidate.
[04:47:08.640 --> 04:47:10.141]  She never actually had a chance.
[04:47:10.601 --> 04:47:11.802]  She already lost.
[04:47:11.922 --> 04:47:13.383]  She already tried and failed.
[04:47:14.063 --> 04:47:14.983]  Now she's sick.
[04:47:15.784 --> 04:47:16.944]  Now she's tired.
[04:47:17.485 --> 04:47:19.926]  She's got all this corruption, all this baggage.
[04:47:19.986 --> 04:47:21.187]  She never had a chance.
[04:47:21.467 --> 04:47:23.168]  Hillary Clinton was the false flag.
[04:47:24.468 --> 04:47:25.209]  Then they tried to
[04:47:26.550 --> 04:47:28.371]  Grease the skids for another false flag!
[04:47:28.531 --> 04:47:29.852]  Oh, Russia's hacking!
[04:47:29.972 --> 04:47:30.753]  Russia's hacking!
[04:47:30.813 --> 04:47:31.433]  It's Russia!
[04:47:31.473 --> 04:47:32.894]  We'll go to war with Russia!
[04:47:33.995 --> 04:47:37.297]  But to answer your question, 100%.
[04:47:37.718 --> 04:47:46.404]  100% chance that the globalists and the establishment in America will do something to try to stay in power.
[04:47:48.092 --> 04:47:56.573]  If they really, I mean, if Trump is really as big of a threat to the establishment and the globalists as we think he is, 100% they will try to pull something.
[04:47:56.633 --> 04:47:59.374]  Now, we're already seeing this happening, folks.
[04:47:59.694 --> 04:48:02.074]  The freakout has already begun.
[04:48:02.114 --> 04:48:03.355]  Can I get a screen share, Marcos?
[04:48:03.395 --> 04:48:04.235]  Is my screen still good?
[04:48:04.255 --> 04:48:06.175]  Alright, I'll pull this up.
[04:48:06.215 --> 04:48:07.875]  But the freakout has already begun.
[04:48:07.915 --> 04:48:15.837]  Now, we've covered this a little bit, and we even shared some of the live video of the protest.
[04:48:15.857 --> 04:48:17.257]  We even had callers call in about it.
[04:48:21.117 --> 04:48:22.117]  Is it working now, Marcos?
[04:48:24.978 --> 04:48:26.158]  It just gave me a weird deal.
[04:48:26.798 --> 04:48:27.638]  Is it not working still?
[04:48:30.959 --> 04:48:32.440]  So we've... Can you stop on it?
[04:48:33.060 --> 04:48:33.820]  I don't know what happened.
[04:48:33.860 --> 04:48:35.960]  It was a weird... Alright, I'll try to get it.
[04:48:36.060 --> 04:48:38.321]  We've already had... Okay, here it goes.
[04:48:38.401 --> 04:48:40.122]  We've already had protests start.
[04:48:40.942 --> 04:48:45.203]  Before Trump was even announced that he won, we had people protesting.
[04:48:47.012 --> 04:48:56.037]  But here's some of the freak out, and I think that this is what they might try to essentially turn into the false flag.
[04:48:57.298 --> 04:48:59.559]  LAPD prepping for riot mode.
[04:49:00.179 --> 04:49:02.240]  Of course, this was last evening.
[04:49:02.800 --> 04:49:13.306]  In some neighborhoods, if Donald Trump wins, and of course, Donald Trump did win, and there were people that essentially rioted in California.
[04:49:15.783 --> 04:49:17.143]  Uh, yeah, that's a different story.
[04:49:17.163 --> 04:49:22.545]  Donald Trump wins White House, protests flare in Oakland.
[04:49:23.505 --> 04:49:27.786]  So, we've already got people protesting in the streets.
[04:49:30.987 --> 04:49:33.268]  Stock futures crashing.
[04:49:34.968 --> 04:49:38.589]  So, you see the stock market is crashing.
[04:49:38.609 --> 04:49:41.310]  Of course, it's already going back up this morning.
[04:49:41.330 --> 04:49:44.591]  That's how it typically goes with these false flags.
[04:49:46.192 --> 04:49:49.295]  Hollywood freaks out about to throw up.
[04:49:51.897 --> 04:49:59.523]  Hollywood stars begin to panic as Hillary Clinton is going to lose.
[04:49:59.543 --> 04:50:04.887]  Celebs who say they would leave the country if Trump won.
[04:50:04.907 --> 04:50:06.149]  We covered this yesterday.
[04:50:06.189 --> 04:50:07.510]  There's a long list of them.
[04:50:07.530 --> 04:50:08.811]  Of course, they're freaking out.
[04:50:08.851 --> 04:50:10.332]  They didn't actually want to leave.
[04:50:10.852 --> 04:50:14.515]  They bought the propaganda that Hillary Clinton could never lose and then they lost.
[04:50:15.322 --> 04:50:16.262]  So what are they going to do now?
[04:50:16.782 --> 04:50:20.203]  Silicon Valley freaking out about election right now.
[04:50:23.724 --> 04:50:28.066]  Networks brace for long night as Donald Trump's momentum shocks.
[04:50:30.606 --> 04:50:31.447]  These are some of the headlines.
[04:50:31.987 --> 04:50:34.247]  Video compilation, this is from the Gateway Pundit.
[04:50:34.908 --> 04:50:38.189]  Pundits and politicians insist Trump cannot win the election.
[04:50:38.509 --> 04:50:41.290]  In fact, hey do you guys think you could get this video up?
[04:50:41.370 --> 04:50:42.610]  Let's actually play this video.
[04:50:43.868 --> 04:50:44.769]  There's a bunch of videos.
[04:50:44.789 --> 04:50:47.931]  Do you guys think you could get this pulled up back here and we can actually listen to some of this?
[04:50:50.494 --> 04:50:52.875]  This was actually a link, uh, this was linked on Drudge Report.
[04:50:52.936 --> 04:50:55.618]  So, basically what I'm saying is... Give me a second.
[04:50:56.499 --> 04:50:57.239]  Thank you, Marcos.
[04:50:58.560 --> 04:51:09.409]  Basically what I'm saying is they've already got the platform for a false flag, where they've got all these people freaking out, um, they've already got riots happening,
[04:51:10.732 --> 04:51:16.414]  So they can bring in a George Soros type of uprising.
[04:51:17.934 --> 04:51:18.795]  Start a new group.
[04:51:20.475 --> 04:51:23.636]  They'll find some catchy name for it, some catchy acronym.
[04:51:24.836 --> 04:51:26.997]  TrumpIsNotMyPresident.com.
[04:51:27.017 --> 04:51:28.258]  You know, something silly like that.
[04:51:28.298 --> 04:51:29.758]  They've already got all this hate spewed.
[04:51:29.778 --> 04:51:31.419]  They've already got people willing to protest.
[04:51:31.439 --> 04:51:35.220]  They've already got celebrities who will hop on this bandwagon.
[04:51:35.300 --> 04:51:38.381]  So I think that that is the
[04:51:41.174 --> 04:51:42.694]  The easiest for them to do.
[04:51:42.814 --> 04:51:45.155]  Would they go as far as to try to start a war?
[04:51:48.676 --> 04:51:50.276]  I would hope not.
[04:51:51.556 --> 04:52:01.078]  But I think that they've already got the skids ready to start fueling protests and to foment some of that via George Soros protest groups.
[04:52:01.438 --> 04:52:02.818]  But here's some of these.
[04:52:03.319 --> 04:52:04.599]  This is from the Gateway Pundit.
[04:52:04.759 --> 04:52:05.939]  See, here's some of the videos.
[04:52:06.399 --> 04:52:09.640]  Pundits and politicians insist Donald Trump cannot win election.
[04:52:09.700 --> 04:52:10.220]  Again, folks,
[04:52:10.820 --> 04:52:25.466]  All the establishment politicians, all the establishment media, the entire time, telling you they are in control, they know what's gonna happen, Trump cannot win, all the people are batting zero.
[04:52:25.546 --> 04:52:26.827]  Let's run down some of these videos.
[04:52:32.549 --> 04:52:34.030]  Hey guys, I'm not sure if we're getting sound.
[04:52:34.110 --> 04:52:34.450]  I'm not.
[04:52:44.150 --> 04:52:46.031]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president.
[04:52:46.131 --> 04:52:48.372]  President Obama on the Republican frontrunner.
[04:52:48.752 --> 04:52:51.514]  It's not hosting a talk show.
[04:52:51.594 --> 04:52:51.794]  Good.
[04:52:52.594 --> 04:52:53.435]  Or a reality show.
[04:52:54.255 --> 04:52:54.655]  It's hard.
[04:52:55.036 --> 04:52:56.076]  Trump's response.
[04:52:56.356 --> 04:52:58.237]  This man has done such a bad job.
[04:52:58.297 --> 04:52:59.678]  He has set us back so far.
[04:53:00.138 --> 04:53:02.359]  And for him to say that actually is a great compliment.
[04:53:02.499 --> 04:53:09.363]  Trump's double-digit lead in our latest NBC News Sunday Monkey National Poll mirrors what's happening in South Carolina.
[04:53:09.423 --> 04:53:10.964]  We love South Carolina.
[04:53:11.004 --> 04:53:11.304]  Let's go.
[04:53:11.744 --> 04:53:13.224]  He's got twice as much support as Ted Cruz.
[04:53:13.244 --> 04:53:14.225]  Alright, that's enough of that.
[04:53:14.285 --> 04:53:15.245]  That's enough of Obama.
[04:53:15.285 --> 04:53:15.825]  How many times?
[04:53:16.065 --> 04:53:20.507]  Because Obama, Obama said Trump couldn't win dozens of times, folks.
[04:53:20.767 --> 04:53:24.508]  Obama said that he doesn't see how Trump could win, it's impossible, no way.
[04:53:25.148 --> 04:53:34.231]  He'd been on that podium forever, campaigning for Hillary, saying, I don't see how Trump wins, there's no way Trump wins, he doesn't know what he's doing.
[04:53:34.251 --> 04:53:38.352]  Barack Obama is a loser.
[04:53:38.933 --> 04:53:39.913]  Let's go to Karl Rove.
[04:53:41.621 --> 04:53:42.262]  Another loser.
[04:54:03.261 --> 04:54:04.942]  Alright, get rid of this.
[04:54:04.962 --> 04:54:07.042]  We don't need to hear this.
[04:54:07.503 --> 04:54:08.043]  Here we go.
[04:54:08.203 --> 04:54:10.864]  We're turned off by those arch-liberals John McCain and Mitt Romney.
[04:54:10.904 --> 04:54:11.964]  That simply is a myth.
[04:54:12.544 --> 04:54:15.725]  It's sort of like trying to refight the Civil War as a lost cause.
[04:54:15.786 --> 04:54:16.126]  Right.
[04:54:16.386 --> 04:54:26.889]  And in order to win the next election, Republicans are going to have to have confidence in their conservative ideals and say we can take them to the Latino community, the African-American community, the Asian community, young people.
[04:54:27.150 --> 04:54:28.890]  Can Donald Trump win a general election?
[04:54:29.310 --> 04:54:30.571]  My view is no, but we'll see.
[04:54:30.711 --> 04:54:31.011]  Why not?
[04:54:31.611 --> 04:54:39.715]  Well, if Mitt Romney lost with 27% among Latinos, how good would somebody do who's got an 11% approval rating?
[04:54:39.735 --> 04:54:41.496]  So who can stop Donald Trump right now?
[04:54:42.497 --> 04:54:45.358]  The person who can talk about their vision.
[04:54:45.538 --> 04:54:47.559]  It's not about stopping Donald Trump.
[04:54:47.599 --> 04:54:49.300]  He's got a hot floor and a low ceiling.
[04:54:50.040 --> 04:54:58.725]  Again, all of the experts, folks, all of the experts, the President of the United States, all the media, batting zero.
[04:54:59.721 --> 04:55:01.442]  Batting zero.
[04:55:01.883 --> 04:55:02.203]  Okay?
[04:55:02.503 --> 04:55:05.806]  Now, you can choose to believe whatever you want to believe.
[04:55:05.966 --> 04:55:07.767]  Did they really think Trump couldn't win?
[04:55:08.208 --> 04:55:15.153]  Were they trying to force-feed the propaganda that Trump couldn't win down your throat as a form of voter suppression and rigging the election?
[04:55:15.774 --> 04:55:16.614]  You be the judge of that.
[04:55:16.815 --> 04:55:17.295]  I don't know.
[04:55:17.715 --> 04:55:20.377]  But, regardless, they're all wrong.
[04:55:21.458 --> 04:55:22.579]  Every single one of them.
[04:55:23.060 --> 04:55:27.924]  And the only people who predicted this Trump victory, for the most part,
[04:55:28.860 --> 04:55:37.162]  Not exclusively, but at least loud and proud, are the conspiracy theorists, the tinfoil hat wearers, the crazy people!
[04:55:38.342 --> 04:55:39.903]  Oh, but we were right.
[04:55:40.783 --> 04:55:42.103]  As usual.
[04:55:42.983 --> 04:55:45.604]  So it's funny how that works.
[04:55:45.964 --> 04:55:57.407]  And it'll be interesting to see if this is finally the example of the conspiracy theorist being right that sends the shockwave through the American public
[04:55:58.612 --> 04:56:06.601]  That hey, maybe I might want to start opening up my mind and listening to some of those theories.
[04:56:07.522 --> 04:56:08.924]  Maybe there is something there.
[04:56:12.188 --> 04:56:17.273]  Or, you can go back to the same people that told you that Donald Trump couldn't win the election, folks.
[04:56:17.293 --> 04:56:20.616]  Of course, the option is up to you.
[04:56:21.217 --> 04:56:22.238]  Let's go back to some callers.
[04:56:22.358 --> 04:56:25.962]  Let's go to Stephen in Dallas.
[04:56:26.802 --> 04:56:28.564]  Stephen wants to talk about what he thinks Obama will do.
[04:56:28.624 --> 04:56:29.225]  Go ahead, Stephen.
[04:56:35.632 --> 04:56:51.001]  Like, I was talking to my parents this morning, I'm 19 years old, and it's just ridiculous the stuff they fall for, and it has to be confirmed by CNN, and everything they believe in has to be confirmed by these mainstream media outlets.
[04:56:51.081 --> 04:57:03.008]  And I told them about the WikiLeaks thing, and how Clintons are Satanists and everything, and now they're kind of starting to wake up, and realizing that, you know, we're taking our country back.
[04:57:03.880 --> 04:57:18.023]  And we're not letting this happen, but my biggest fear is, you know, with Soros, with the Black Lives Matter and everything, my biggest fear is, you know, what's going to happen before Trump is allowed in the office, before he's actually in, you know?
[04:57:18.484 --> 04:57:27.906]  I don't know what, you know, Obama's been passing, you know, these executive orders while this election's been happening as well.
[04:57:27.926 --> 04:57:32.387]  Well, and the thing about it is, too, I mean, you talk about, you know,
[04:57:33.516 --> 04:57:34.757]  These are failed attempts.
[04:57:34.797 --> 04:57:35.838]  These are failed movements.
[04:57:35.878 --> 04:57:38.360]  I mean, the Black Lives Matter movement is a failed movement.
[04:57:38.400 --> 04:57:39.261]  What have they accomplished?
[04:57:39.541 --> 04:57:43.504]  This is a movement, this is a group that has been around for more than two years now.
[04:57:43.785 --> 04:57:44.445]  What have they done?
[04:57:44.585 --> 04:57:45.626]  They've done nothing.
[04:57:46.027 --> 04:57:46.947]  They've done nothing.
[04:57:47.147 --> 04:57:50.831]  They've burned, rioted, looted, and police officers have died.
[04:57:51.511 --> 04:58:01.860]  So, I mean, whatever, maybe, you know, again, I'm not saying, the people, I'm sure there's people involved in these groups that are well-meaning people, there's issues in this country, nobody's denying that, but the point is these movements have failed.
[04:58:02.761 --> 04:58:13.010]  If they go back to something like a Black Lives Matter protest movement as a way of a false flag or something in order to incite some sort of event,
[04:58:13.991 --> 04:58:18.573]  In order to perhaps, I guess, keep Trump from being inaugurated, suspend the inauguration.
[04:58:18.613 --> 04:58:21.354]  I don't even know what good that would do at this point.
[04:58:22.174 --> 04:58:22.654]  It'll fail.
[04:58:22.994 --> 04:58:24.415]  It'll be another failed attempt.
[04:58:25.435 --> 04:58:28.996]  So we'll see if they go back to the drawing board and try to come up with something else.
[04:58:30.096 --> 04:58:32.457]  But there's no doubt, or you know what we hope?
[04:58:32.617 --> 04:58:33.518]  I'll tell you what, how about this?
[04:58:36.479 --> 04:58:43.281]  All of these criminals, the Clintons, the Podestas, Foval, Kramer, Obama, you know what?
[04:58:44.619 --> 04:58:45.299]  Just go.
[04:58:46.459 --> 04:58:46.779]  Okay?
[04:58:47.460 --> 04:58:48.160]  Just go.
[04:58:49.140 --> 04:58:49.800]  Just go.
[04:58:50.440 --> 04:58:51.940]  I know you've got land somewhere.
[04:58:52.401 --> 04:58:54.381]  I know you've got Palisades somewhere.
[04:58:54.841 --> 04:59:03.043]  Off the grid, out of our lives, you want to avoid justice, you want to survive during World War III, nuclear war, just go.
[04:59:04.023 --> 04:59:05.423]  Just go.
[04:59:06.583 --> 04:59:06.904]  Okay?
[04:59:07.424 --> 04:59:08.484]  If that's what it takes,
[04:59:09.656 --> 04:59:12.718]  For you to leave us alone, then just go.
[04:59:13.138 --> 04:59:17.180]  Ride off into the sunset with your criminal enterprise and go.
[04:59:17.600 --> 04:59:18.740]  Leave us alone.
[04:59:18.760 --> 04:59:23.963]  I will, I will, me personally, maybe not Trump, but I would, I would be okay with that.
[04:59:24.243 --> 04:59:24.863]  Just go.
[04:59:25.224 --> 04:59:26.104]  Leave me alone.
[04:59:26.444 --> 04:59:27.405]  Leave my country.
[04:59:27.745 --> 04:59:30.846]  Take your criminal cabal and just go.
[04:59:30.866 --> 04:59:34.308]  But my guess is they're going to try to fight this to the death and
[04:59:37.810 --> 04:59:42.332]  They won't leave, and they're gonna end up having to face justice.
[04:59:43.592 --> 04:59:47.713]  So, whose justice will it be, I guess, is the question then.
[04:59:48.214 --> 04:59:49.034]  Trump's justice?
[04:59:49.134 --> 04:59:50.234]  We the People's justice?
[04:59:50.254 --> 04:59:51.835]  A corrupt FBI justice?
[04:59:52.415 --> 04:59:53.375]  A UN justice?
[04:59:55.036 --> 04:59:56.756]  Maybe we'll find out in the next two months.
[04:59:57.857 --> 05:00:04.759]  It's crazy, the next two months, you know, we've got Thanksgiving and Christmas and New Years, and then the inauguration.
[05:00:04.779 --> 05:00:07.020]  These next two months are gonna fly.
[05:00:08.491 --> 05:00:10.353]  And who else knows what we can expect?
[05:00:11.273 --> 05:00:12.795]  Let's take another caller.
[05:00:12.935 --> 05:00:18.359]  Let's go to Zach in Louisiana.
[05:00:20.181 --> 05:00:20.961]  Go ahead, Zach.
[05:00:22.303 --> 05:00:22.503]  Hi.
[05:00:23.343 --> 05:00:27.227]  So, yeah, I'm just extremely happy with what happened.
[05:00:29.981 --> 05:00:47.732]  I just like, I just go back to 2008 and all these people were beaming with pride over Obama and how, I mean like, oh you have to, it's a new era, we're gonna, everything's gonna be great and sunshine and rainbows and everything's gonna be awesome and you just have to accept it.
[05:00:48.713 --> 05:00:54.396]  And now, come back here, 2016, you got, oh, every white person, uneducated, uh,
[05:00:58.683 --> 05:00:59.864]  He's a terrible person.
[05:00:59.884 --> 05:01:06.129]  People tell him to F off on Facebook, their family members, everything.
[05:01:06.189 --> 05:01:15.376]  I'm just like... I was extremely upset in 2008 when I knew it was coming, but I accepted it.
[05:01:16.256 --> 05:01:18.238]  I mean, that was a landslide of landslides.
[05:01:19.078 --> 05:01:27.545]  And we're... I mean, in a sense, it is a landslide with what we have.
[05:01:28.103 --> 05:01:36.805]  We're not winning the popular vote, but just the shock and awe of what happened because of such the bad polling.
[05:01:36.825 --> 05:01:40.226]  Oh, you were saying that they didn't do a segment on the pollsters?
[05:01:40.286 --> 05:01:41.226]  I was listening to you earlier.
[05:01:41.646 --> 05:01:49.288]  Actually, they had Maddow and all the other people on MSNBC because I was flipping back between you guys at about 3 in the morning because I just couldn't sleep because I was too charged.
[05:01:51.532 --> 05:01:58.556]  They'll do a segment on the polls and the segment will be shocked, upset, nobody saw it coming.
[05:01:58.617 --> 05:01:59.417]  That's what it'll be.
[05:01:59.897 --> 05:02:02.979]  It won't be, uh, why are our polls always wrong?
[05:02:03.420 --> 05:02:04.981]  Why were we totally wrong?
[05:02:05.001 --> 05:02:08.583]  How come none of the polls actually reflected reality?
[05:02:08.623 --> 05:02:10.984]  That's not how they're gonna cover this.
[05:02:11.245 --> 05:02:17.288]  Well, the thing is, they're all trying to put the blame on the pollsters and not themselves.
[05:02:17.809 --> 05:02:19.350]  They're trying to keep some semblance of
[05:02:20.286 --> 05:02:23.467]  Of uh, I don't know, credibility in their eyes?
[05:02:24.187 --> 05:02:44.714]  I mean, but... I don't know, I mean... No, that's a good point, that's a good point because they know they've been completely discredited, but then in order to try to save any integrity that they have, they're gonna continue to spout complete nonsense.
[05:02:46.084 --> 05:02:50.447]  These people, I'm sorry, these people are complete losers.
[05:02:50.987 --> 05:02:53.649]  They are complete failures, okay?
[05:02:53.669 --> 05:02:55.931]  Again, just go.
[05:02:56.431 --> 05:02:57.792]  Just go.
[05:02:57.992 --> 05:03:00.054]  Your time is gone.
[05:03:00.274 --> 05:03:01.595]  So just be gone with it.
[05:03:03.996 --> 05:03:05.157]  Yeah.
[05:03:05.818 --> 05:03:08.540]  So, I mean, they're not going anywhere.
[05:03:08.840 --> 05:03:11.942]  And what we really need for the next probably two months
[05:03:12.540 --> 05:03:16.401]  We need Julian Assange to keep the drip going with just more...
[05:03:43.852 --> 05:03:56.361]  And it'll just be hilarious no matter what we find, the Hillary Clinton supporters will still say Trump is the worst and that they can't believe that you elected Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton.
[05:03:57.021 --> 05:04:01.204]  And then in a very strange move, think about this actually, wow, wow.
[05:04:04.858 --> 05:04:11.022]  Hillary Clinton ends her campaign with Lady Gaga.
[05:04:11.322 --> 05:04:12.463]  Freudian slip, by the way.
[05:04:12.783 --> 05:04:13.404]  I'm sorry, what's that?
[05:04:13.544 --> 05:04:15.065]  Freudian slip, by the way.
[05:04:15.645 --> 05:04:16.786]  She ends her campaign.
[05:04:19.208 --> 05:04:19.908]  Did you say that on air?
[05:04:20.989 --> 05:04:21.329]  Oh yeah.
[05:04:21.509 --> 05:04:21.890]  Thank you.
[05:04:22.710 --> 05:04:25.092]  So the whore ends her whore campaign.
[05:04:25.132 --> 05:04:25.972]  Her whore campaign.
[05:04:27.273 --> 05:04:27.794]  Freudian slip.
[05:04:27.834 --> 05:04:32.697]  No, but... So, the final event of Clinton's campaign is
[05:04:35.242 --> 05:04:55.757]  Lady Gaga, a Satanist who takes part in Satan occult spirit cooking dinners, who goes to art shows where there's naked bodies in bathtubs with a bloody-like substance that you go up to and you scoop it off of the naked body and then eat it.
[05:04:55.917 --> 05:04:57.018]  A total freak, folks.
[05:04:57.578 --> 05:05:03.943]  Not only is this freak going to Satan occult dinners and doing Satan occult worship art ceremonies,
[05:05:05.427 --> 05:05:11.830]  She's dressed up in a Nazi SS uniform performing at Hillary Clinton's event!
[05:05:12.430 --> 05:05:21.915]  So Hillary Clinton's final event, final move in the campaign, because here's the deal folks, she knows that she's not going to win a vote from an intellectual.
[05:05:21.995 --> 05:05:24.316]  She knows that none of her constituents are intellectuals.
[05:05:24.756 --> 05:05:27.958]  She knows that none of her voters are actually smart, educated people.
[05:05:28.258 --> 05:05:29.579]  It's the dumbest of the dumb.
[05:05:29.939 --> 05:05:31.139]  It's the window shoppers.
[05:05:31.400 --> 05:05:32.920]  It's the drive-by media viewers.
[05:05:33.120 --> 05:05:33.841]  So what does she do?
[05:05:34.321 --> 05:05:36.422]  Well, I'll put Lady Gaga out there.
[05:05:36.482 --> 05:05:37.583]  I'll give you Jay-Z.
[05:05:37.663 --> 05:05:39.023]  I'll give you LeBron James.
[05:05:39.704 --> 05:05:47.968]  Thinking that the dumbest of the dumb, the brainwashed sheeple, the dumbed-down Americans are going to eat it up and love her because of it.
[05:05:48.949 --> 05:05:55.432]  Again, underestimating the American people, underestimating the fact that we are intelligent and that we do do research and that we are educated.
[05:05:55.752 --> 05:05:56.572]  Sorry, Hillary.
[05:05:57.133 --> 05:05:58.994]  We didn't fall for your Lady Gaga crap.
[05:06:00.148 --> 05:06:02.309]  But so she puts Lady Gaga out there.
[05:06:02.329 --> 05:06:05.590]  Wait a second, was that Marina Abramovic at a TED Talks?
[05:06:07.491 --> 05:06:08.711]  She's done a TED Talks?
[05:06:09.271 --> 05:06:13.113]  Oh yeah, about her performance art where she carved a pentagram into her belly.
[05:06:14.901 --> 05:06:16.622]  I didn't know she did a TED Talks!
[05:06:17.242 --> 05:06:17.962]  What a freak!
[05:06:18.402 --> 05:06:20.263]  What's a bigger freak?
[05:06:20.883 --> 05:06:23.764]  Marina Abramovitz, a Satanist, doing a TED Talk?
[05:06:24.344 --> 05:06:31.006]  Or Bill Gates doing a TED Talk and telling you that the human population needs to be eradicated, folks?
[05:06:31.306 --> 05:06:34.547]  You don't think there's a global population control program going on?
[05:06:34.887 --> 05:06:39.209]  Watch Bill Gates' TED Talks and then look at what Bill Gates does around the world
[05:06:40.009 --> 05:06:41.132]  With his vaccines.
[05:06:41.653 --> 05:06:48.187]  And then what happens in an aftermath in those countries where the Bill and Melinda Gates vaccines actually go.
[05:06:48.528 --> 05:06:49.771]  But that's neither here nor there.
[05:06:49.791 --> 05:06:50.592]  Let's get back to the point.
[05:06:51.320 --> 05:06:54.502]  Sorry, I saw Marina Abramovic on a TED Talk and that sent me on a whole different road.
[05:06:55.102 --> 05:06:56.823]  But these are the people that Clinton associates with.
[05:06:57.243 --> 05:07:07.349]  So the last day of her campaign, Satanist Lady Gaga performs in a Nazi SS outfit with a, looks like a German haircut.
[05:07:08.430 --> 05:07:10.511]  Folks, she tried to look like a German Nazi, okay?
[05:07:10.771 --> 05:07:11.512]  This is blatant.
[05:07:11.712 --> 05:07:16.575]  There's a reason why Hillary Clinton wears Mao outfits and Lady Gaga is dressed like Hitler, okay?
[05:07:17.195 --> 05:07:17.995]  There's a reason for this.
[05:07:20.216 --> 05:07:32.179]  They know you're so stupid that you won't see the iconic imagery that they're putting forth for the establishment shills or for the establishment power brokers that they're actually trying to please.
[05:07:33.379 --> 05:07:40.400]  So Lady Gaga, the final piece of the puzzle in Hillary Clinton's campaign for presidency.
[05:07:41.501 --> 05:07:42.281]  Then tonight,
[05:07:43.669 --> 05:07:46.211]  Today, we don't hear or see anything from Hillary.
[05:07:46.251 --> 05:07:47.171]  She's in hiding, right?
[05:07:47.571 --> 05:07:48.512]  Never saw Hillary.
[05:07:49.072 --> 05:07:50.093]  Never heard from Hillary.
[05:07:50.533 --> 05:07:51.354]  She's been in hiding.
[05:07:52.454 --> 05:07:56.056]  Thousands of people go to her event in New York.
[05:07:57.637 --> 05:07:58.658]  And what do they get?
[05:08:00.319 --> 05:08:07.323]  John Podesta telling them that Hillary will not be making a statement tonight.
[05:08:08.924 --> 05:08:11.246]  So, final two moves of the Clinton campaign.
[05:08:12.366 --> 05:08:13.187]  Lady Gaga
[05:08:16.001 --> 05:08:22.330]  Someone who hangs out with Satanist and admires, she said, Satanist Marina Abramovich.
[05:08:23.312 --> 05:08:31.083]  And then John Podesta, someone the entire alt-right in social media is convinced is a pedophile.
[05:08:34.480 --> 05:08:41.526]  Of course, this is alleged, but these are the two final pieces in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[05:08:42.407 --> 05:08:58.622]  Lady Gaga, a talented musician as she may be, a Satan observer and worshipper who eats bodily fluids off of naked bodies in bathtubs as art, and John Podesta,
[05:09:00.265 --> 05:09:07.951]  Who the entire alt-right internet community is alleging is running a child pedophilia ring.
[05:09:14.015 --> 05:09:14.876]  Good choice, Hillary.
[05:09:16.037 --> 05:09:17.017]  Real good work, Hillary.
[05:09:18.078 --> 05:09:20.300]  Boy, you really had it down this time, didn't you?
[05:09:22.502 --> 05:09:23.282]  So there you go, folks.
[05:09:23.322 --> 05:09:26.645]  That's how you fail a presidential campaign.
[05:09:28.098 --> 05:09:32.080]  Let's go to Charles in California.
[05:09:32.180 --> 05:09:32.941]  Go ahead, Charles.
[05:09:35.562 --> 05:09:36.462]  Thanks for having me on.
[05:09:36.482 --> 05:09:38.023]  Thanks for calling.
[05:09:39.324 --> 05:09:41.245]  I've never called into this show before.
[05:09:41.265 --> 05:09:47.268]  You know, I did want to say that I don't think Hillary won the popular vote here in California.
[05:09:48.169 --> 05:09:51.610]  I went to polling, to my polling place, kind of late.
[05:09:53.011 --> 05:09:56.353]  And when I was sitting down filling out my ballot,
[05:09:57.298 --> 05:10:02.382]  I had a lady come in there, uh, you know, she seemed like she was rushing.
[05:10:02.442 --> 05:10:10.208]  She said that she hadn't gotten her, uh, registration, uh, to actually vote there.
[05:10:10.248 --> 05:10:15.072]  She hadn't got that assigned to the polling place and that she was registered in San Jose, which is a few cities over.
[05:10:16.313 --> 05:10:20.196]  And they gave her, um, like a provisional ballot anyways, and they let her vote.
[05:10:22.423 --> 05:10:23.504]  That's illegal.
[05:10:23.564 --> 05:10:30.928]  You're supposed to have registered with your polling place by 15 days before the election, which should pass by the 24th.
[05:10:32.710 --> 05:10:34.311]  And I wanted to get that comment in.
[05:10:34.911 --> 05:10:42.476]  Well, they're running programs now where you can just show up at the poll and they'll let you vote.
[05:10:43.316 --> 05:10:45.698]  Registered, ID, doesn't matter.
[05:10:47.110 --> 05:10:53.299]  But so you're saying you think that the entire state of California was rigged?
[05:10:55.081 --> 05:10:56.624]  No, I'm just telling you, man.
[05:10:56.684 --> 05:10:57.465]  I sat down there.
[05:10:57.995 --> 05:11:10.124]  And this lady came in with an agenda to like get this vote and I saw her, she sat right behind me, I looked behind me and she filled out that ballot like she had done it 10 times that day and then she just handed it over the folder and left.
[05:11:10.485 --> 05:11:21.573]  She made some quick story up and like convinced this guy and I was staring, I was leering at this dude, one of the polling volunteers, when he slittered that paper and I went and asked him, I'm like, what was that?
[05:11:21.633 --> 05:11:24.175]  Because I overheard the conversation and she was saying that
[05:11:24.781 --> 05:11:28.923]  Like she, you know, she moved from San Jose or something and she just really wanted to vote.
[05:11:28.943 --> 05:11:30.364]  She lives across the street in the apartment.
[05:11:30.384 --> 05:11:32.826]  I'm like, this is, this ain't right.
[05:11:32.886 --> 05:11:36.328]  So I don't think the numbers coming in from California are correct.
[05:11:36.348 --> 05:11:42.231]  I also heard something else, like somebody found like 80 ballots on someone's porch down south in Orange County.
[05:11:45.093 --> 05:11:45.913]  So, no.
[05:11:45.973 --> 05:11:46.433]  That's very...
[05:11:48.210 --> 05:11:51.432]  So, well, I mean, obviously you've seen the results in California.
[05:11:51.492 --> 05:11:55.234]  Clinton won in a landslide, almost doubling Donald's votes.
[05:11:55.294 --> 05:11:56.994]  You realize that, right?
[05:11:58.435 --> 05:12:04.838]  Yeah, and I mean, there's a lot of people that do support her because, you know, they get caught up in all the emotional nonsense.
[05:12:05.759 --> 05:12:08.980]  But I don't think the numbers are accurate.
[05:12:09.700 --> 05:12:15.403]  I think that there's less Clinton supporters than were polled.
[05:12:17.952 --> 05:12:21.416]  I mean, that's what I observed, and I wanted to report that.
[05:12:21.456 --> 05:12:27.484]  I also want to thank you guys, you know, for bringing up, you know, the fluoride in the water, the endocrine disruptors in aerosols.
[05:12:28.044 --> 05:12:35.053]  You know, people are not as aware as they should be, and people are eating things that are making them sick, and frankly, I think making them stupid.
[05:12:36.187 --> 05:12:37.448]  And I think that's the biggest problem.
[05:12:37.608 --> 05:12:43.552]  And these are non-partisan issues that every American should get behind, you know?
[05:12:44.552 --> 05:12:58.962]  And it's sad that we're so divided now, where, you know, you have people that, just because I'm a Trump supporter, or this, that, or the other thing, won't even listen to my opinion.
[05:12:59.960 --> 05:13:00.560]  You know what I'm saying?
[05:13:00.840 --> 05:13:02.721]  They'll label me a conspiracy theorist.
[05:13:02.761 --> 05:13:03.861]  Thank you so much for the calls.
[05:13:03.941 --> 05:13:04.342]  Actually, hold on.
[05:13:04.362 --> 05:13:05.402]  I'm going to hold Charles for a second.
[05:13:05.422 --> 05:13:06.282]  I want to ask him one more question.
[05:13:07.423 --> 05:13:15.646]  They'll label me a conspiracy theorist based on one thing I say, and they'll refuse to do any research into the actual issue, and they don't even understand.
[05:13:16.646 --> 05:13:21.108]  If we could all try to get the fluoride out of the water, we would be a lot better off.
[05:13:21.848 --> 05:13:23.829]  And then you wouldn't have people like female-aged Skrillex.
[05:13:23.869 --> 05:13:24.789]  But here's the thing, folks.
[05:13:26.150 --> 05:13:29.031]  Even if you want to believe that fluoride is good for you,
[05:13:29.977 --> 05:13:30.297]  Fine.
[05:13:30.417 --> 05:13:30.697]  Whatever.
[05:13:30.797 --> 05:13:32.138]  Believe fluoride is good for you.
[05:13:32.879 --> 05:13:34.980]  So is a hammer to the back of your head.
[05:13:36.060 --> 05:13:36.541]  Guess what?
[05:13:37.341 --> 05:13:39.542]  Forced medication is illegal.
[05:13:40.563 --> 05:13:46.366]  You don't give an infant the same amount of medication you give to an adult.
[05:13:47.126 --> 05:13:48.007]  This is logic.
[05:13:48.067 --> 05:13:49.127]  This is common sense.
[05:13:49.628 --> 05:13:51.328]  We should be against forced medication.
[05:13:51.689 --> 05:13:57.312]  If fluoride is good for you, and I need it for whatever reason, then provide it to me in a supplement.
[05:13:58.243 --> 05:14:00.124]  That's what we do at Infowarstore.com!
[05:14:00.524 --> 05:14:01.825]  We give you nasoniodine.
[05:14:02.145 --> 05:14:04.446]  We give you bio-PQQ in different products.
[05:14:05.087 --> 05:14:07.208]  Why are you force-medicating me fluoride?
[05:14:07.508 --> 05:14:13.431]  Why did the Nazis do that to the Jews in the concentration camps?
[05:14:13.911 --> 05:14:18.794]  Why is fluoride directly correlated with a drop in IQ?
[05:14:19.934 --> 05:14:21.715]  This is a non-partisan issue!
[05:14:23.216 --> 05:14:24.396]  But we are really divided.
[05:14:24.436 --> 05:14:25.317]  We are polarized.
[05:14:27.355 --> 05:14:29.037]  And I think you can blame the media a lot for that.
[05:14:29.137 --> 05:14:41.309]  But again, I just want to ask you, Charles, so what do you think the actual, I mean, you're saying that you don't think Hillary Clinton actually had double the votes that Trump did in California?
[05:14:41.329 --> 05:14:43.431]  I just want to hear one last comment before I let you go.
[05:14:44.672 --> 05:14:47.956]  What do you think is going on in California then because Hillary Clinton won in a landslide?
[05:14:47.976 --> 05:14:49.137]  What do you think actually happened?
[05:14:50.134 --> 05:15:07.760]  You had a bunch of, I have to say it, Latino Americans that were very concerned and maybe had some family members or something they were concerned about and were, I guess, felt like it was appropriate to go and commit fraud and they felt like they had the tools to do it and they felt like they were given the okay.
[05:15:08.640 --> 05:15:10.401]  So, that's what I saw.
[05:15:12.319 --> 05:15:14.139]  No, she didn't double the vote.
[05:15:14.399 --> 05:15:16.240]  She probably won just because L.A.
[05:15:16.280 --> 05:15:23.522]  and Hollywood and San Francisco, but there's no way she got as many as doubling.
[05:15:23.542 --> 05:15:24.142]  Yep.
[05:15:27.722 --> 05:15:28.043]  Okay.
[05:15:28.323 --> 05:15:30.703]  Well, that's interesting and that's kind of what I was saying.
[05:15:30.743 --> 05:15:31.583]  Thank you for the call.
[05:15:32.303 --> 05:15:33.824]  That's kind of what I was saying where
[05:15:36.254 --> 05:15:38.396]  You're the only people that are watching these polls.
[05:15:38.796 --> 05:15:39.557]  Actually, that's not true.
[05:15:39.597 --> 05:15:40.237]  I shouldn't say that.
[05:15:40.277 --> 05:15:41.318]  It's not only Republicans.
[05:15:41.358 --> 05:15:42.019]  I take that back.
[05:15:42.039 --> 05:15:43.000]  It's not only Trump supporters.
[05:15:43.040 --> 05:15:44.101]  Well, it might be only Trump supporters.
[05:15:44.121 --> 05:15:46.843]  I don't think there's any Hillary Clinton supporters that are worried about election fraud.
[05:15:47.243 --> 05:15:47.664]  They don't know.
[05:15:47.704 --> 05:15:52.548]  They're worried about, you know, who Brad Pitt is dating or some crap like that.
[05:15:53.889 --> 05:15:56.972]  But that's an interesting point you make because I was alluding to this earlier where
[05:15:58.271 --> 05:16:02.332]  You know, for me, it was obvious that Trump was going to win pretty early.
[05:16:02.392 --> 05:16:06.573]  Well, I thought I knew he was going to win the whole time as long as they couldn't just outright steal it.
[05:16:08.194 --> 05:16:12.495]  So that's why when I showed up today, I had my bottle of bubbly and my cigar ready to go.
[05:16:12.515 --> 05:16:21.358]  I was expecting the Trump victory and especially towards the end of the night when they're tabulating California late into the night, still doing it.
[05:16:22.947 --> 05:16:26.291]  We're not really paying attention as much with election fraud.
[05:16:26.311 --> 05:16:28.054]  We're not worried as much with voter fraud.
[05:16:28.074 --> 05:16:29.976]  We're not looking at these polls and these numbers.
[05:16:30.837 --> 05:16:39.368]  So if they were going to steal votes, if they were going to shave points, if they were going to do any of that in a massive fashion, California would have been the place to do it.
[05:16:40.413 --> 05:16:45.274]  And in the last, you know, four hours would have been the time.
[05:16:46.035 --> 05:16:47.675]  And that's basically what we've seen.
[05:16:47.815 --> 05:16:51.836]  And the last caller from California is not buying the numbers that were being told.
[05:16:52.916 --> 05:16:53.437]  So I don't know.
[05:16:53.817 --> 05:16:54.117]  I don't know.
[05:16:54.137 --> 05:16:55.197]  That's an interesting point.
[05:16:55.957 --> 05:16:59.418]  Maybe there'll be someone with answers for that.
[05:16:59.958 --> 05:17:01.119]  Maybe we'll never have answers.
[05:17:01.159 --> 05:17:01.859]  I'm not sure.
[05:17:03.439 --> 05:17:03.819]  More.
[05:17:04.580 --> 05:17:07.941]  This is another push notification from Yahoo.
[05:17:07.981 --> 05:17:09.421]  Can I get a document cam here, guys?
[05:17:11.992 --> 05:17:15.494]  This United States is from Good Morning America.
[05:17:15.615 --> 05:17:17.256]  Push notification from Yahoo.
[05:17:17.816 --> 05:17:20.858]  How world media is reacting to election night.
[05:17:21.659 --> 05:17:26.122]  Now the funny thing is... I'm playing a little game of chicken here with my cameraman.
[05:17:27.699 --> 05:17:32.320]  Dis United States, how world media is reacting to election night.
[05:17:33.160 --> 05:17:37.221]  Now, if Hillary had won, it would be, United States shines!
[05:17:37.582 --> 05:17:38.782]  United States did it!
[05:17:39.222 --> 05:17:40.762]  United States not racist!
[05:17:41.082 --> 05:17:42.463]  United States not bigoted!
[05:17:43.083 --> 05:17:44.443]  United States for women!
[05:17:44.523 --> 05:17:46.544]  It'd be everything positive, everything great.
[05:17:46.744 --> 05:17:47.964]  But you're gonna see this, folks.
[05:17:49.505 --> 05:17:50.805]  The big media outlets
[05:17:51.991 --> 05:18:02.526]  Who were shills for Clinton, are going to be spreading negative press, they're going to be shedding negative light, dark light on the Trump victory.
[05:18:02.546 --> 05:18:06.532]  They're going to try to spin this like it was a bad thing, because they lost!
[05:18:07.032 --> 05:18:07.994]  Because they were wrong.
[05:18:09.707 --> 05:18:11.068]  That's how it's gonna do.
[05:18:11.128 --> 05:18:12.049]  Again, right in here.
[05:18:12.829 --> 05:18:18.214]  News outlets across the globe are reacting after Donald Trump pulled off a stunning victory!
[05:18:18.234 --> 05:18:20.075]  It was stunning, folks!
[05:18:21.076 --> 05:18:22.737]  It was stunning!
[05:18:24.839 --> 05:18:25.419]  Stunning?
[05:18:26.120 --> 05:18:28.522]  Divided America, bitter to the end!
[05:18:30.612 --> 05:18:33.276]  Brutal contest has riven America!
[05:18:33.997 --> 05:18:36.181]  It's all of these negative headlines, folks.
[05:18:36.421 --> 05:18:37.583]  This is what they're gonna try to do.
[05:18:37.623 --> 05:18:40.227]  They're gonna... Trump is already the most hated president.
[05:18:40.267 --> 05:18:41.388]  He hasn't even entered office yet.
[05:18:42.711 --> 05:18:55.604]  And they're going to try to already make his presidency look bad by printing and publishing all of these negative headlines today about Donald Trump's victory, about America, because we won.
[05:18:55.764 --> 05:18:56.645]  So there's the fight.
[05:18:57.346 --> 05:18:59.007]  Here's the beginning of the fight.
[05:18:59.047 --> 05:19:00.469]  Here's the beginning of the false flag.
[05:19:00.489 --> 05:19:02.311]  They're not going to leave us alone, are they?
[05:19:02.351 --> 05:19:05.334]  They're not going to admit we beat them!
[05:19:07.206 --> 05:19:07.326]  Oh!
[05:19:07.406 --> 05:19:08.466]  We beat you!
[05:19:08.806 --> 05:19:10.107]  We beat you!
[05:19:10.527 --> 05:19:10.947]  Okay?
[05:19:11.407 --> 05:19:11.947]  Admit it!
[05:19:12.707 --> 05:19:13.628]  Admit we beat you!
[05:19:13.648 --> 05:19:15.228]  Admit it, Yahoo!
[05:19:15.428 --> 05:19:16.188]  You were wrong!
[05:19:16.488 --> 05:19:17.548]  Admit it, ABC!
[05:19:17.728 --> 05:19:18.509]  You were wrong!
[05:19:18.529 --> 05:19:19.489]  Okay?
[05:19:20.349 --> 05:19:21.769]  Quit trying to spin this!
[05:19:22.169 --> 05:19:23.830]  God, these people won't stop!
[05:19:25.210 --> 05:19:26.970]  These people will not stop!
[05:19:28.791 --> 05:19:29.291]  Ha ha ha!
[05:19:30.586 --> 05:19:33.447]  Okay, so the fight goes on, folks.
[05:19:33.487 --> 05:19:36.168]  The fight for reality continues on.
[05:19:37.068 --> 05:19:40.870]  Even after Trump wins, they're still going to try to character slam him.
[05:19:40.910 --> 05:19:42.790]  They're still going to try to drag him through the mud.
[05:19:42.990 --> 05:19:45.331]  They're still going to try to drag our country through the mud.
[05:19:45.671 --> 05:19:48.052]  But if Hillary won, everything's great!
[05:19:48.352 --> 05:19:49.173]  Everything's awesome!
[05:19:49.213 --> 05:19:49.933]  America did it!
[05:19:50.053 --> 05:19:51.373]  America ended racism!
[05:19:51.413 --> 05:19:52.594]  America put a woman in!
[05:19:53.394 --> 05:20:10.305]  Even though this woman is a racist, even though this woman hangs out with satanists, even though this woman steals money from Haiti, even though this money, even though this woman uses her foundation as a money laundering scheme to avoid, see, I mean, I'm not even going to get into it, folks.
[05:20:10.345 --> 05:20:12.246]  Again, this is the media.
[05:20:13.287 --> 05:20:15.048]  This is how they twist reality.
[05:20:15.768 --> 05:20:18.010]  And I think I realize something now.
[05:20:20.080 --> 05:20:24.084]  They have been in this spiral for so long.
[05:20:25.185 --> 05:20:30.550]  They've been in this backward spiral for so long where they've just been wrong.
[05:20:30.811 --> 05:20:31.752]  They're just wrong.
[05:20:31.812 --> 05:20:43.964]  They've been batting zero for so long that they try to prop themselves up by always spinning it and demonizing the people that were right.
[05:20:45.914 --> 05:20:49.716]  And whenever they're wrong, blaming something else for it.
[05:20:50.217 --> 05:21:08.267]  Instead of just admitting they were wrong, and trying to recover and be right, they can't admit they were wrong, they blame somebody else, and then they spin it as if America is bad, or Trump is bad, or whoever it is that ruined their prediction is bad.
[05:21:13.134 --> 05:21:17.898]  This is, folks, just, just, just, I know, I know that I'm preaching to the choir, okay?
[05:21:18.599 --> 05:21:21.642]  But just do not let these people drag you down.
[05:21:22.242 --> 05:21:24.564]  Do not let these people steal this victory.
[05:21:24.584 --> 05:21:27.547]  Do not let them try to paint this in a negative light.
[05:21:27.987 --> 05:21:28.768]  Do not buy it.
[05:21:28.808 --> 05:21:32.892]  These are the pathetic entities in the media that were wrong the entire time.
[05:21:33.252 --> 05:21:36.956]  They're gonna try to make us feel bad, just like they did the entire election cycle.
[05:21:37.256 --> 05:21:41.500]  They're gonna continue to try to demoralize us, just like they did the entire election cycle.
[05:21:41.760 --> 05:21:42.962]  We cannot let them do it.
[05:21:43.242 --> 05:21:48.767]  Do not let them... They couldn't steal it from us, so now they're ticked and bitching and moaning here.
[05:21:49.148 --> 05:21:50.689]  Don't let them steal our joy either.
[05:21:51.970 --> 05:21:54.413]  In fact, we need to rub this in their face.
[05:21:56.465 --> 05:21:58.466]  Continue to celebrate on social media.
[05:21:58.926 --> 05:22:01.487]  Continue to call into the radio programs bragging.
[05:22:02.467 --> 05:22:04.467]  Continue to wear your Trump gear out.
[05:22:04.948 --> 05:22:06.988]  We need to really shove this down their throats.
[05:22:08.269 --> 05:22:14.851]  If they're gonna continue to shove their propaganda down our throats, then we'll go ahead and just shove our victory down their throats.
[05:22:14.891 --> 05:22:15.471]  That's what we'll do.
[05:22:16.749 --> 05:22:17.429]  That's what we'll do.
[05:22:18.350 --> 05:22:26.094]  I can only imagine these talk shows that are going on right now and what they're saying about Donald Trump and the American people.
[05:22:27.874 --> 05:22:28.995]  They want to demonize us.
[05:22:29.055 --> 05:22:43.082]  The biggest liars, cowards, and frauds on the face of the earth are going to demonize the American people because we didn't elect the sick, twisted, corrupt puppet Hillary Clinton that they told us to elect.
[05:22:45.947 --> 05:22:48.488]  Here's a big, fat middle finger to you, mainstream media.
[05:22:49.368 --> 05:22:52.430]  Here's a big, fat middle finger to you, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton.
[05:22:53.190 --> 05:22:54.671]  We beat you.
[05:22:55.431 --> 05:22:55.991]  We beat ya.
[05:22:57.672 --> 05:22:58.752]  God, it feels so good.
[05:22:58.772 --> 05:23:01.533]  It feels so good to beat these people!
[05:23:03.754 --> 05:23:05.415]  We are in control, folks!
[05:23:05.995 --> 05:23:07.076]  Let's take another call.
[05:23:07.896 --> 05:23:09.257]  Nell in New York City.
[05:23:09.297 --> 05:23:09.977]  Go ahead, Nell.
[05:23:13.738 --> 05:23:14.479]  Hey, what's up, guys?
[05:23:14.519 --> 05:23:14.879]  How are you?
[05:23:16.145 --> 05:23:16.846]  I'm feeling good.
[05:23:16.886 --> 05:23:22.369]  I'm not going to let the liars in the media and the politicians try to take our joy of this victory.
[05:23:22.390 --> 05:23:25.251]  Oh, you definitely shouldn't.
[05:23:25.291 --> 05:23:27.473]  Let me explain my background.
[05:23:27.573 --> 05:23:28.033]  I'm a chef.
[05:23:28.073 --> 05:23:30.935]  I work in a very well-known restaurant in Midtown Manhattan.
[05:23:31.195 --> 05:23:32.716]  I work the overnight shift, right?
[05:23:33.617 --> 05:23:35.538]  And I listen to your show every day, by the way.
[05:23:36.279 --> 05:23:37.860]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[05:23:38.320 --> 05:23:40.242]  Now, I actually had an issue at work.
[05:23:41.531 --> 05:23:46.955]  Because I was listening to the show and some of my co-workers were getting offended by the things I was listening to.
[05:23:47.635 --> 05:23:55.320]  So my boss actually asked me not to listen to your show at work.
[05:23:55.981 --> 05:24:01.044]  Which is kind of ironic because he himself voted for Donald Trump.
[05:24:02.345 --> 05:24:05.808]  He was the only person besides me at my job that voted for Donald Trump.
[05:24:08.004 --> 05:24:23.408]  So do you think that he is, um, so perhaps maybe your boss is afraid that, you know, listening to Infowars or Alex Jones and maybe a customer hears it and freaks out and doesn't use you guys, doesn't provide you guys business anymore?
[05:24:23.428 --> 05:24:24.328]  Is that what you think is going on?
[05:24:25.309 --> 05:24:28.550]  Well, I work the overnight shift, so there's no customers by the time I get in.
[05:24:28.590 --> 05:24:32.951]  But I work, this is the thing, I work with a large number of foreigners.
[05:24:33.051 --> 05:24:37.032]  I'm not going to say particularly where they're from, but they are of the Islamic faith.
[05:24:38.634 --> 05:24:44.696]  And every time they hear Alex talking about Islam and these things, they get very offended right away.
[05:24:45.357 --> 05:24:45.897]  Right away.
[05:24:46.177 --> 05:24:47.477]  And they complained to my boss.
[05:24:48.398 --> 05:24:51.979]  And my boss actually asked me to turn off the show one time.
[05:24:52.399 --> 05:24:57.561]  And I told him, I said, listen, dude, freedom of speech, you know, I'm not harming anybody.
[05:24:57.801 --> 05:25:07.505]  So I really don't think, you know, that I should have to turn off my broadcast because, you know, these are things that are important in American politics, you know, and in life in general.
[05:25:08.635 --> 05:25:14.580]  You know, and then, and this is, you know, I thank you guys for keeping me informed about, you know, world events and the things that are going on.
[05:25:14.600 --> 05:25:16.821]  You know, I'm very grateful for that.
[05:25:17.642 --> 05:25:18.322]  You know what I'm saying?
[05:25:18.402 --> 05:25:29.371]  But I just, the irony, you know, and one of my coworkers, actually, a young man who's a line cook at my job, we, you know, we have political discussions every day.
[05:25:29.391 --> 05:25:34.955]  And before he left, he was like, oh, he was like, I cast him out to vote for Hillary, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[05:25:34.995 --> 05:25:37.297]  And I asked him why, and he couldn't give me a straight answer.
[05:25:38.385 --> 05:25:48.313]  Couldn't give me a straight answer, so why do you support a woman that, you know, that supposedly is supposedly the champion for minorities and for women and all this other crap that she talks?
[05:25:49.894 --> 05:25:50.815]  Which is actually false!
[05:25:52.056 --> 05:25:53.417]  Yeah, she takes money from Saudi Arabia.
[05:25:53.457 --> 05:25:57.060]  It was the same Hillary Clinton that supported longer sentences for petty drug offenders.
[05:25:57.620 --> 05:25:58.601]  Yeah, it was her husband.
[05:25:58.621 --> 05:25:59.301]  For mostly minorities.
[05:25:59.321 --> 05:26:00.983]  Yeah, her husband is the one that wrote the bill.
[05:26:02.356 --> 05:26:03.637]  Exactly, exactly.
[05:26:03.857 --> 05:26:12.843]  And I tried explaining it to this man, you know, showing him the proof, you know, and he's like, it's like, it's like everybody's willing to turn a blind eye not to see the truth.
[05:26:14.925 --> 05:26:16.926]  It's kind of sickening.
[05:26:16.946 --> 05:26:18.367]  Well, here's the problem.
[05:26:18.407 --> 05:26:19.027]  Here's the problem.
[05:26:19.307 --> 05:26:19.488]  And, and...
[05:26:21.932 --> 05:26:24.472]  I'm glad that you listen to the Alex Jones Show at work.
[05:26:24.513 --> 05:26:32.534]  I'm glad that you're such a brave American that you would actually play the Alex Jones Show, not just have it in your earbuds.
[05:26:32.794 --> 05:26:33.594]  But here's the thing.
[05:26:35.475 --> 05:26:45.917]  You know, listening to the Alex Jones Show for the first time for most people, and I'm not trying to sound insensitive here by any stretch, because we've all been affected by this.
[05:26:45.997 --> 05:26:47.677]  It's just the best analogy I could think of.
[05:26:48.877 --> 05:26:53.240]  Hearing the Alex Jones Show for the first time for most people is like finding out you have cancer.
[05:26:54.541 --> 05:27:16.719]  Because the things that Alex Jones talks about, the way he talks about them, the way he connects the dots, the way he's historically informed, and the issues he brings to the forefront are things that most people have no idea about, but he's so convicted and he's so vindicated in the things that he talks about, it's so real that
[05:27:18.231 --> 05:27:22.613]  Again, it's like hearing you have cancer.
[05:27:23.134 --> 05:27:29.677]  It's so extreme, it's so intense, that it hits you.
[05:27:30.357 --> 05:27:33.779]  And you cannot help but have a serious emotional response.
[05:27:34.319 --> 05:27:37.221]  You cannot help but feel like you have a physical response.
[05:27:38.581 --> 05:27:40.562]  And it's a serious thing, like you said.
[05:27:40.602 --> 05:27:43.264]  Like you said, these are serious issues to be American.
[05:27:43.284 --> 05:27:44.705]  These are serious issues in the world.
[05:27:45.385 --> 05:27:47.226]  If you have cancer, that's a serious issue.
[05:27:48.407 --> 05:27:58.631]  And so for most people, you know, hearing these things for the first time, it's like that big of a blow to yourself, you know, personally.
[05:27:59.391 --> 05:28:03.652]  Again, I'm not trying to sound insensitive here with, you know, obviously it's not the exact same thing.
[05:28:03.692 --> 05:28:04.893]  I'm just trying to use this analogy.
[05:28:04.913 --> 05:28:08.254]  But I think that that's why your boss feels that way.
[05:28:08.314 --> 05:28:11.195]  I'm not, whether it's right or wrong, you know, we can have that discussion.
[05:28:11.215 --> 05:28:12.516]  You and your boss can have that discussion.
[05:28:13.996 --> 05:28:15.417]  But I think that that's what's going on.
[05:28:16.357 --> 05:28:18.078]  Because don't we all kind of feel that way, folks?
[05:28:18.818 --> 05:28:23.420]  I mean, don't we all kind of feel that way when we're around people that we just don't know?
[05:28:23.581 --> 05:28:26.442]  That maybe we're listening to Alex Jones a little too loud?
[05:28:27.402 --> 05:28:28.323]  You know what I'm talking about.
[05:28:30.234 --> 05:28:32.835]  I play it loud and proud for all to hear.
[05:28:32.855 --> 05:28:35.517]  You know, the speaker that I use is very boisterous.
[05:28:35.557 --> 05:28:37.798]  You know, it amplifies sounds throughout the whole restaurant.
[05:28:37.818 --> 05:28:39.339]  You know, we have a pretty big restaurant.
[05:28:39.679 --> 05:28:42.360]  And the nice part is very, like, there's not too many nice parts.
[05:28:42.380 --> 05:28:46.522]  Maybe like seven guys, the dishwashers, and the porters, and one night cook, which is me.
[05:28:47.483 --> 05:28:51.845]  So, I mean, I play it loud for everybody to hear because, you know, we're all Americans.
[05:28:52.125 --> 05:28:55.607]  And, you know, if you live here, you need to know what the hell's going on here.
[05:28:56.240 --> 05:28:58.101]  Well, I completely agree, and I salute you.
[05:28:58.442 --> 05:29:00.083]  I mean, believe me, man, I salute you.
[05:29:00.143 --> 05:29:01.524]  You are an info warrior.
[05:29:01.564 --> 05:29:04.105]  You are fighting the good fight.
[05:29:04.125 --> 05:29:05.687]  You are probably even making a difference.
[05:29:07.028 --> 05:29:10.710]  I mean, you know, I bet that some people hear that for the first time.
[05:29:11.411 --> 05:29:12.351]  That's how it was for me.
[05:29:12.952 --> 05:29:16.114]  First time I heard it, I mean,
[05:29:17.375 --> 05:29:20.536]  Again, folks, you don't hear people talk like this on television.
[05:29:20.997 --> 05:29:25.899]  Now, some people on television are starting to get it and head in that direction.
[05:29:26.359 --> 05:29:30.601]  And you'll notice that those people are kicking ass in the ratings, Sean Hannity.
[05:29:31.821 --> 05:29:35.323]  But for the most part, people have no clue that this is going on.
[05:29:36.103 --> 05:29:46.688]  They've been basically put into a state of a trance with sports and pop culture entertainment.
[05:29:47.819 --> 05:29:53.083]  And for them to hear, hey, the vaccines are killing us.
[05:29:53.564 --> 05:29:56.907]  Hey, there's fluoride and glyphosates in the water.
[05:29:57.507 --> 05:30:01.591]  Hey, the government is so corrupt that they lie to us to start wars.
[05:30:02.511 --> 05:30:15.963]  I mean, these are extreme things that affect you immediately, that cause you to not just have a response physically and emotionally, but now, you know, you have to act!
[05:30:17.566 --> 05:30:27.873]  Unless you're completely docile or just sedated, you have to act.
[05:30:27.933 --> 05:30:28.733]  You have a conscience.
[05:30:28.773 --> 05:30:29.834]  You have a moral soul.
[05:30:30.434 --> 05:30:31.215]  You have a spirit.
[05:30:31.875 --> 05:30:33.116]  You want to have a lineage.
[05:30:33.897 --> 05:30:35.037]  So you have to act.
[05:30:37.279 --> 05:30:39.860]  So again, I'm not saying whether it's right or wrong or bad or good.
[05:30:40.081 --> 05:30:43.283]  I'm just simply responding to the story you were telling me because
[05:30:44.960 --> 05:30:48.222]  You know, that's really what it's like, folks.
[05:30:49.083 --> 05:30:50.384]  And America does have cancer.
[05:30:51.385 --> 05:30:51.705]  We do.
[05:30:54.067 --> 05:30:54.607]  We really do.
[05:30:55.448 --> 05:31:01.692]  And it's... It started and metastasized in Washington, D.C.
[05:31:03.934 --> 05:31:08.097]  And then it's been spread throughout this country via the mainstream news.
[05:31:10.879 --> 05:31:11.580]  And Hollywood.
[05:31:14.082 --> 05:31:14.242]  And...
[05:31:17.327 --> 05:31:24.308]  Now, these sources of cancer have failed and are dying.
[05:31:26.329 --> 05:31:30.670]  And they've been completely wrong for the last year and a half, longer than that, but we can prove it.
[05:31:30.870 --> 05:31:33.770]  I mean, in spades, the last year and a half with this election cycle.
[05:31:35.931 --> 05:31:37.831]  And these are the sources of the cancer, folks.
[05:31:39.772 --> 05:31:45.973]  Now, this cancer wants to kill you so that it can live in peace.
[05:31:47.031 --> 05:31:47.912]  How it wants to live.
[05:31:48.592 --> 05:31:49.833]  Killing anything in its way.
[05:31:51.974 --> 05:31:55.897]  So that's why you can't know that America has cancer.
[05:31:57.618 --> 05:32:06.463]  And that's why for most people it's such a shocking thing to hear, you know, obviously, you know, you hear you got cancer, obviously that's shocking, right?
[05:32:07.064 --> 05:32:08.064]  Your life is at stake.
[05:32:09.305 --> 05:32:10.186]  That's the point, folks.
[05:32:10.366 --> 05:32:11.386]  America has cancer.
[05:32:11.466 --> 05:32:12.727]  America's life is at stake.
[05:32:14.468 --> 05:32:14.628]  And
[05:32:16.078 --> 05:32:31.088]  Maybe InfoWars is, you know, the cancer screening that told you you had cancer, and now maybe Donald Trump is whatever therapy in order to eradicate this cancer.
[05:32:31.268 --> 05:32:34.250]  And that's what we hope, because we want America to live.
[05:32:37.132 --> 05:32:41.295]  I'm going to take one more call before I sign things over to Rob Dew.
[05:32:42.759 --> 05:32:46.700]  Let's take John in Austin, Texas.
[05:32:47.840 --> 05:32:48.440]  What's up, John?
[05:32:48.460 --> 05:32:49.900]  Hey, how's it going?
[05:32:50.041 --> 05:32:52.421]  I just want to say, yeah, thank you guys for doing all that you do.
[05:32:52.741 --> 05:32:59.122]  And it was a really close election, and I think that you guys, you know, with Drudge and everybody else, sort of pulled it together for the end.
[05:32:59.142 --> 05:33:01.843]  I'm psyched about waking up this morning.
[05:33:01.863 --> 05:33:03.283]  It's like Christmas morning.
[05:33:03.303 --> 05:33:04.683]  You know, I'm proud to be an American.
[05:33:05.524 --> 05:33:11.925]  And I think, you know, Donald Trump has the potential to be the best president we've ever had, like a George Washington type level.
[05:33:13.007 --> 05:33:14.068]  Oh, sorry about that.
[05:33:42.563 --> 05:33:49.449]  And it's like, you know, when the Constitution was signed, you know, someone asked Ben Franklin, you know, what type of government did you give us?
[05:33:49.830 --> 05:33:51.732]  He said he gave us the Republic if we can keep it.
[05:33:51.752 --> 05:33:55.795]  And I think today's, I mean, it's a lot like 1776.
[05:33:58.661 --> 05:33:59.642]  Well, I agree.
[05:33:59.762 --> 05:34:17.390]  It's kind of like a modern day 1776 where just like the British were sitting on us and wanting to control us, the globalists and the Washington establishment has been doing the same thing and we rejected them with the election and nomination of Donald Trump.
[05:34:18.231 --> 05:34:22.333]  And for me, Donald Trump always was more of a John Hancock because
[05:34:24.249 --> 05:34:51.141]  What John Hancock represented in 1776, because he wasn't really behind the movement at first, but the reason why John Hancock was so pivotal, and the reason why John Hancock's name is the biggest name on the Declaration of Independence, is because John Hancock was one of the richest and most powerful MFers in New England.
[05:34:54.141 --> 05:35:05.446]  There were a bunch of people that were behind this movement for a long time, folks, trying to get 1776 in motion for a long time, and it just, they could not get it going.
[05:35:06.847 --> 05:35:19.653]  And what happened when John Hancock signed the Declaration of Independence with his monstrous signature, that was a big middle finger to the establishment and to Britain
[05:35:20.578 --> 05:35:21.779]  Because he was huge.
[05:35:22.259 --> 05:35:22.540]  See?
[05:35:23.460 --> 05:35:25.582]  He was a monster businessman.
[05:35:26.022 --> 05:35:28.324]  He owned, like, all the ports in Boston.
[05:35:29.245 --> 05:35:36.311]  And when the establishment, you know, saw John Hancock's name on it, it was like, oh crap.
[05:35:37.892 --> 05:35:39.413]  That's what Donald Trump has been.
[05:35:40.234 --> 05:35:42.376]  I remember so many times thinking,
[05:35:43.746 --> 05:35:46.927]  You know, how can we wake the people up?
[05:35:46.947 --> 05:35:48.308]  Because nobody's going to listen to me.
[05:35:49.308 --> 05:35:51.049]  They won't even listen to Alex Jones.
[05:35:51.189 --> 05:35:52.889]  Why are they going to listen to Owen Schroer?
[05:35:54.310 --> 05:35:55.590]  We need a celebrity.
[05:35:55.650 --> 05:35:56.791]  We need a billionaire.
[05:35:56.831 --> 05:36:06.014]  We need a successful somebody to come forward and say these things, to legitify them, to bring them into the spotlight, just like John Hancock did.
[05:36:07.555 --> 05:36:09.155]  And that's what Donald Trump did, folks.
[05:36:10.296 --> 05:36:13.437]  Nobody was talking about the open border until Donald Trump.
[05:36:14.881 --> 05:36:19.464]  Nobody was talking about TPP until Donald Trump.
[05:36:20.465 --> 05:36:30.292]  Nobody was talking about the secret 21 pages of the 9-11 investigation except Donald Trump.
[05:36:31.273 --> 05:36:39.359]  Nobody was talking about NAFTA and GATT and all of our jobs and manufacturing being shipped overseas except Donald Trump.
[05:36:40.427 --> 05:36:49.770]  Nobody was talking about these trade deals ripping us off, how we got sent into this debt and this deficit, except Donald Trump.
[05:36:50.590 --> 05:37:05.014]  So you see, while everybody's been ignoring this in the mainstream news, while everybody in the public's been ignoring this for whatever reason, maybe they don't believe it, maybe they've never seen it, here comes Donald Trump, like John Hancock,
[05:37:05.987 --> 05:37:13.651]  Big name, powerful man, charismatic, everybody knows who he is, and he brings it to the forefront, folks.
[05:37:14.152 --> 05:37:17.053]  That's what John Hancock did for the Declaration of Independence in 1776.
[05:37:17.794 --> 05:37:21.076]  That's what Donald Trump did for us in June 2015.
[05:37:23.577 --> 05:37:28.100]  So that's why I've always kind of felt like Donald Trump was more like John Hancock, but I do agree with you.
[05:37:28.120 --> 05:37:33.083]  I think he's got the chance to be one of the greatest presidents of all time, and, um,
[05:37:34.209 --> 05:37:41.751]  That's a high expectation to hold for him, but I bet he holds it to himself, and he certainly has the opportunity.
[05:37:42.571 --> 05:38:01.475]  Given how far this country's fallen to corruption, how far our moral fabric in society has decayed, Donald Trump certainly has a great opportunity to not just make America great again, but go down in history as one of the greatest American presidents, and perhaps even world leaders of all time.
[05:38:02.862 --> 05:38:05.483]  And I hope that Donald Trump can live up to that billing.
[05:38:06.984 --> 05:38:10.065]  But really, it's going to be an effort.
[05:38:10.546 --> 05:38:11.406]  Because think about it, folks.
[05:38:11.426 --> 05:38:14.288]  Donald Trump, still right now, today, is just an American citizen.
[05:38:15.668 --> 05:38:16.789]  He's not been inaugurated.
[05:38:17.469 --> 05:38:18.490]  He's never held office.
[05:38:18.750 --> 05:38:23.032]  He's an American citizen like you and I. So, it's we the people
[05:38:24.025 --> 05:38:35.797]  That put Donald Trump in office, and it's we the people that are going to have to put Donald Trump on the map, historically speaking, as the greatest president of all time, whatever it ends up being.
[05:38:35.817 --> 05:38:45.787]  This is a movement led by we the people, for we the people, and that's what it's going to take to really solidify this legacy.

[05:39:20.804 --> 05:39:22.045]  And you know what?
[05:39:22.065 --> 05:39:28.808]  Thanks to Marcos, Ashley, Wes, Joe, everybody that helped me back there.
[05:39:28.868 --> 05:39:29.788]  You guys are awesome.
[05:39:29.848 --> 05:39:30.668]  I love you guys.
[05:39:31.769 --> 05:39:40.412]  Thanks to Rob Dew for giving me the opportunity to come on air here in a very long-winded fashion, if you will.
[05:39:43.129 --> 05:39:46.170]  Again, thanks to all the people out there who support InfoWars, the callers.
[05:39:47.071 --> 05:39:48.932]  We would not be in this position without you.
[05:39:48.972 --> 05:39:57.416]  So, my final thing, as I sign off here for the last time on the 52-hour broadcast, Rob Dew will be taking over on the other side.
[05:39:57.456 --> 05:40:00.397]  This is a song that I wrote, a song that we sang.
[05:40:00.837 --> 05:40:02.999]  Today is Trump's victory day.
[05:40:03.099 --> 05:40:04.899]  Today is our victory day.
[05:40:05.380 --> 05:40:06.780]  This is Go Trump Go.
[05:40:06.820 --> 05:40:08.321]  This is a song we sang last week.
[05:40:09.061 --> 05:40:12.023]  Enjoy this on our great victory day.
[05:40:13.160 --> 05:40:13.620]  Here we go.
[05:40:15.640 --> 05:40:17.501]  Don't let me embarrass myself.
[05:40:19.001 --> 05:40:20.941]  See, kind of trendy.
[05:40:20.981 --> 05:40:21.702]  Jack that up.
[05:40:24.202 --> 05:40:26.722]  Election season's underway.
[05:40:28.663 --> 05:40:31.403]  But you better get ready for a brand new day.
[05:40:32.263 --> 05:40:32.643]  Hey!
[05:40:33.784 --> 05:40:36.264]  Hey, America, what do you say?
[05:40:38.004 --> 05:40:40.965]  Trump is gonna win today.
[05:40:43.327 --> 05:40:45.388]  Go Trump, go!
[05:40:45.729 --> 05:40:47.550]  Go Trump, go!
[05:40:48.170 --> 05:40:50.431]  Hey America, what do you say?
[05:40:50.611 --> 05:40:52.913]  Trump is gonna win today!
[05:40:53.013 --> 05:40:55.194]  Go Trump, go!
[05:40:55.294 --> 05:40:57.155]  Go Trump, go!
[05:40:57.735 --> 05:41:00.036]  Hey America, what do you say?
[05:41:00.196 --> 05:41:02.358]  Trump is gonna win today!
[05:41:02.398 --> 05:41:04.959]  He's got the power, he's got the speed!
[05:41:05.039 --> 05:41:06.500]  Singing the whole song!
[05:41:07.020 --> 05:41:09.482]  To be the presidential nominee!
[05:41:11.946 --> 05:41:17.950]  Well this is the year and Trump is the man!
[05:41:17.990 --> 05:41:21.793]  To make America great again!
[05:41:21.913 --> 05:41:23.714]  Go Trump Go!
[05:41:24.354 --> 05:41:26.276]  Go Trump Go!
[05:41:26.816 --> 05:41:29.138]  Hey America, what do you say?
[05:41:29.218 --> 05:41:31.279]  Trump is gonna win today!
[05:41:41.826 --> 05:41:42.827]  I don't think so.
[05:41:55.561 --> 05:42:00.665]  Send Hillary Clinton to prison!
[05:42:00.745 --> 05:42:02.446]  Go Trump Go!
[05:42:03.107 --> 05:42:04.868]  Go Trump Go!
[05:42:05.549 --> 05:42:07.851]  Hey America, what do you say?
[05:42:07.911 --> 05:42:10.152]  Trump is gonna win today!
[05:42:10.353 --> 05:42:12.034]  Go Trump Go!
[05:42:12.614 --> 05:42:14.336]  Go Trump Go!
[05:42:14.376 --> 05:42:17.458]  Hey America, what do you say?
[05:42:17.518 --> 05:42:20.901]  Trump is gonna win today!
[05:42:21.281 --> 05:42:22.342]  Go Trump Go!
[05:42:25.886 --> 05:42:28.188]  Hillary for prison!
[05:42:28.248 --> 05:42:35.952]  Don't vote for people who go for spirit cooking!

[05:44:10.809 --> 05:44:15.991]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[05:44:16.411 --> 05:44:22.373]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[05:44:22.533 --> 05:44:25.654]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[05:44:25.814 --> 05:44:27.255]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[05:44:27.475 --> 05:44:31.618]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[05:44:31.798 --> 05:44:34.681]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[05:44:34.741 --> 05:44:36.322]  It works like an antioxidant.
[05:44:36.402 --> 05:44:39.504]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
