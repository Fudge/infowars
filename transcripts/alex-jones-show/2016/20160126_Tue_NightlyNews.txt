[00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:21.493]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:25.637]  It is Tuesday, January 26, 2016, and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:25.937 --> 00:00:27.039]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.303 --> 00:00:36.468]  Tonight, a political insider says it doesn't matter who you vote for.
[00:00:36.488 --> 00:00:38.931]  Hillary has this one in the bag.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.963]  Then, mass sexual assaults at a Stockholm train station are reported to be more than just groping.
[00:00:47.804 --> 00:00:50.785]  And France declares a permanent police state.
[00:00:51.425 --> 00:00:52.046]  That's next!
[00:00:52.662 --> 00:01:09.734]  I started digressing off into this domestication process, and how people are scared of things they shouldn't be, because the media teaches them how, through Pavlovian conditioning and peer pressure, that it's fun to get scared of the Muslim terrorist, though the honeybee's much more deadly statistically.
[00:01:10.034 --> 00:01:14.758]  It's fun to get scared of the great white shark, even though they kill maybe three people a year worldwide.
[00:01:15.218 --> 00:01:20.882]  It's fun to get scared of things that don't matter, but then, meanwhile, tornadoes just kill 300 people in one day.
[00:01:30.222 --> 00:01:31.583]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:33.163]  You can't survive without it.
[00:01:33.363 --> 00:01:34.264]  But where do you get it?
[00:01:34.564 --> 00:01:40.326]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:46.268]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:01:46.468 --> 00:02:03.329]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.850]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:07.391]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:07.672 --> 00:02:08.452]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:09.333]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:11.454]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:02:33.965 --> 00:02:45.513]  Alex Jones has been sending out a dire warning to anyone who would listen about this dangerous and unprecedented bill that's trying to make its way through Congress, trying to pass it under the cloak of Snowmageddon.
[00:02:45.973 --> 00:02:52.158]  This would be a blank check for whomever becomes the next president to declare war anywhere.
[00:02:52.478 --> 00:02:57.861]  No geographical boundaries to when, where, for how long they could declare war.
[00:02:58.382 --> 00:03:00.023]  And, you know, he's been catching a lot of flack.
[00:03:00.063 --> 00:03:03.225]  People say, oh, you're just fear-mongering, you conspiracy theorist.
[00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:04.125]  This isn't like that at all.
[00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:08.068]  Well, now we have a Democratic senator taking to the Senate floor.
[00:03:08.428 --> 00:03:16.213]  This is Senator Chris Murphy, and he said that this resolution is a total rewrite of the War Powers Clause of the Constitution.
[00:03:17.253 --> 00:03:22.275]  It is essentially a declaration of international martial law.
[00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:30.158]  A sweeping transfer of military power to the President that will allow him or her to send U.S.
[00:03:30.378 --> 00:03:38.441]  troops almost anywhere in the world for almost any reason with absolutely no limitations.
[00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:44.665]  It's safe to say that this resolution is the wrong way to authorize war against ISIS.
[00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:49.788]  The language of this resolution is dangerous and it is unprecedented.
[00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:53.211]  The American people want Congress to authorize war against ISIS.
[00:03:53.671 --> 00:03:58.454]  But they also want us to make sure that we don't send hundreds of thousands of U.S.
[00:03:58.494 --> 00:04:05.159]  soldiers back into the Middle East to fight a war that has to be won first and foremost with regional partners.
[00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:16.405]  And they certainly don't want Congress to hand over the power to the President to send our troops into any country, anywhere in the world, for almost any reason.
[00:04:17.106 --> 00:04:19.227]  And that's what this resolution would do.
[00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:30.349]  And so, of course, this is the exact same thing that Ron Paul was saying last week, that this particular resolution would make the Iraq War Authorization of 2002 look like a walk in the park.
[00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:37.593]  Now, Senator Murphy went on to say, it gives the power to the President, without consulting Congress, to deploy U.S.
[00:04:37.633 --> 00:04:43.376]  forces in any one of the 61 countries where ISIS has a single sympathizer.
[00:04:43.736 --> 00:04:44.616]  And think about that.
[00:04:45.196 --> 00:04:45.637]  We are
[00:04:46.237 --> 00:04:56.805]  We're seeing what is happening to Europe and other countries where we're having these refugees, this migrant crisis where all of these ISIS sympathizers are now being placed all over the globe.
[00:04:57.285 --> 00:05:02.189]  We have people coming across the southern border with fake Syrian passports.
[00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.270]  No one knows who they are or how to vet them.
[00:05:04.611 --> 00:05:11.256]  So this is a frightening thing to think whoever might be the next president will have unprecedented power to declare war.
[00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:15.599]  This is the whole reason why the founders set up the three branches of the government
[00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:19.622]  To make sure that we don't have a dictator in office who's going to send U.S.
[00:05:19.662 --> 00:05:21.623]  troops off to perpetual war.
[00:05:21.883 --> 00:05:23.384]  This is very frightening.
[00:05:23.764 --> 00:05:29.468]  And you have to understand with this international martial law, this is basically war against the world.
[00:05:30.109 --> 00:05:36.073]  And this is the perfect pattern, the perfect problem reaction solution.
[00:05:36.393 --> 00:05:37.493]  We're going to fund ISIS.
[00:05:37.674 --> 00:05:38.854]  We're going to drop them weapons.
[00:05:39.115 --> 00:05:42.377]  We're going to train them and ship them all around the world.
[00:05:42.537 --> 00:05:45.499]  And then we're going to declare international martial law to deal with that.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.162]  We have the article from Curt Nemo today.
[00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:50.424]  France declares permanent police state.
[00:05:50.905 --> 00:05:59.234]  French Prime Minister Manuel Valls has declared a state of emergency which will last until the total and global war against the Islamic State is completed.
[00:05:59.634 --> 00:06:05.881]  Additionally, the French President Hollande has told senior officials that the extension of the measure is possible.
[00:06:06.181 --> 00:06:10.745]  Ball said we will have to live for decades or for many years with this menace or this threat.
[00:06:11.005 --> 00:06:12.306]  And that's why it's a war.
[00:06:12.326 --> 00:06:16.010]  And of course, all this came about after the November 13th attacks.
[00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.331]  And initially, the police had many raids.
[00:06:18.352 --> 00:06:22.095]  They had over 2000 raids and arrested hundreds of people.
[00:06:22.695 --> 00:06:27.979]  And you know, the French people were in a similar state, I guess, to Americans to an extent after 9-11.
[00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:36.705]  Many people cheer the policies, initiatives of President George Bush, TSA, Patriot Act, you know, NSA spying, all these other things.
[00:06:37.205 --> 00:06:41.648]  And just after a few months of having similar measures in France, it's wearing a little thin.
[00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:47.032]  And if you think about things we have here, things that happened after 9-11, and now these things are still in place.
[00:06:47.312 --> 00:06:47.933]  You still have
[00:06:48.473 --> 00:06:50.734]  The TSA patting you down at the airport.
[00:06:50.754 --> 00:06:59.056]  Initially they were patting down Muslim military-aged men, and now since the videos have come out them patting little schoolgirls, people have an issue with this.
[00:06:59.076 --> 00:07:03.717]  So you can't just wait until it comes to you, until the issue comes to you, because you see those anecdotes.
[00:07:04.018 --> 00:07:09.939]  They came for the Jews, they came for the whatever, they came for the whatever, and then they came to me and there's nobody to fight by my side.
[00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:11.760]  So when you see this thing come to your door and say,
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.501]  I understand there are threats out there, but you can't sacrifice your liberty for security.
[00:07:17.761 --> 00:07:18.482]  Back to you Leanne.
[00:07:19.762 --> 00:07:35.186]  Here when someone is making such a dire warning, but at the same exact time continuing to open the borders to people that the governments admit that they cannot vet, ISIS says we're going to be sending 500,000 of our fighters into Europe and just
[00:07:35.626 --> 00:07:35.866]  I'm good.
[00:07:51.090 --> 00:08:03.474]  The USA Patriot Act, which basically says you can search all buildings, private residences, there's preemptive arrest without probable cause, any individual deemed by French authorities to be suspect or dangerous.
[00:08:03.814 --> 00:08:07.335]  And of course, we know from our own experience that this notion is dangerous.
[00:08:07.775 --> 00:08:08.295]  It's vague.
[00:08:08.575 --> 00:08:11.996]  It could potentially apply to anyone, especially political dissidents.
[00:08:12.336 --> 00:08:14.217]  And French citizens were all for this.
[00:08:14.838 --> 00:08:20.086]  Immediately following those terrorist attacks, they were saying, yes, please, go ahead, implement this police state.
[00:08:20.387 --> 00:08:24.433]  But now, they're having second thoughts about it, as they're seeing their rights being stripped away.
[00:08:25.612 --> 00:08:28.895]  This is Stephan Hughes and Alex Lantier.
[00:08:28.935 --> 00:08:37.644]  They say, as if in a slow motion coup d'etat, the ruling elite is moving to transform political life in France, creating an authoritarian regime.
[00:08:38.164 --> 00:08:44.811]  Under the state of emergency, public protests are banned, there is no guarantee of freedom of the press or freedom of assembly,
[00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:49.735]  And no judicial oversight of arbitrary searches and seizures carried out by police.
[00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.818]  And we've already seen them banning protests.
[00:08:52.858 --> 00:08:55.681]  They can't have any freedom of assembly there.
[00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:58.664]  And so already changing the way of life.
[00:08:59.324 --> 00:09:01.626]  And in July of last year, one of the U.S.
[00:09:01.706 --> 00:09:10.635]  Army's top officers echoed this call that said that the war against ISIS will last 10 to 20 years, probably longer.
[00:09:11.235 --> 00:09:22.002]  So the problem reaction solution, we're going to create this problem for you and we'll fix it for you with our permanent police state and our perpetual war, which will be everywhere.
[00:09:22.242 --> 00:09:29.446]  And so you're now starting to see them preparing the stage for whoever is going to be the next dictatorial president.
[00:09:29.746 --> 00:09:35.170]  Congress has been giving away their power even when, with this last election,
[00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.852]  Democrats were booted out of office.
[00:09:38.332 --> 00:09:47.299]  The Republicans that all went in gave the entire fiscal year for 2015 and 2016 over to the outgoing Democratic Party.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.282]  So they've already been planning this, giving up their power.
[00:09:50.342 --> 00:09:51.503]  They don't want to deal with it.
[00:09:51.783 --> 00:09:52.704]  So it's pretty frightening.
[00:09:53.224 --> 00:09:56.187]  And then now this is coming out of Sweden.
[00:09:56.627 --> 00:10:01.651]  Gangs of all-male Moroccan migrant children are taking over train stations there.
[00:10:01.691 --> 00:10:04.113]  They're stealing, groping, and beating women.
[00:10:05.474 --> 00:10:07.195]  Now, this is coming after the fact.
[00:10:07.215 --> 00:10:21.104]  We've already seen these integration guides and brochures aimed at explaining how in Western European society it's, you know, you don't really grope women even if you think that they're wearing suggestive clothing.
[00:10:21.525 --> 00:10:24.226]  You shouldn't poop in the pool, things like that.
[00:10:24.266 --> 00:10:24.727]  Well, now
[00:10:25.387 --> 00:10:30.831]  Apparently, we have a lot of Moroccan street children who are taking over the train stations there.
[00:10:31.492 --> 00:10:36.436]  They're stealing, groping, beating women, and they're basically, they've got the police on their knees.
[00:10:36.476 --> 00:10:42.061]  They don't know how to deal with these little rapey Lord of the Flies gangs that they've got here in these tunnels.
[00:10:44.983 --> 00:10:52.747]  They say that the authorities have, they're a huge problem for the authorities and they refuse any help from the Swedish authorities.
[00:10:52.787 --> 00:10:56.389]  So people have invited them all in and they don't want help.
[00:10:56.429 --> 00:10:57.950]  They don't want to stay in the refugee centers.
[00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:00.431]  They don't want to stay with the families who are taking these people in.
[00:11:02.532 --> 00:11:11.042]  They're in the streets burglarizing, stealing stuff everywhere according to the authorities, and slapping women when they protest being groped and raped.
[00:11:11.182 --> 00:11:11.983]  So there you go.
[00:11:12.023 --> 00:11:17.910]  There's one of the little pamphlets of how not to touch women in the Western world.
[00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:18.651]  What is the norm here?
[00:11:20.373 --> 00:11:34.284]  Here's what I don't understand, is this capitulation for this to people who are so wracked with guilt that they capitulate and say, please, it's fine, grope us, just please don't think that we are xenophobic.
[00:11:34.624 --> 00:11:37.166]  We actually have feminist women there in Cologne
[00:11:38.167 --> 00:11:41.429]  Who are not concerned about protecting the safety of women there.
[00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:48.693]  They are actually apologizing by giving migrants roses following the mass molestation that took place on New Year's Eve.
[00:11:48.713 --> 00:11:54.776]  They went to the largest refugee center and handed out roses as a gesture against xenophobia.
[00:11:55.516 --> 00:12:03.941]  And, you know, this is just sort of a disturbing reminder of how the left responds to these attacks instead of demanding that migrants change their behavior.
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:09.483]  Which has of course led to a rape epidemic sweeping Europe.
[00:12:10.324 --> 00:12:13.126]  They're the ones that are now bowing down and apologizing.
[00:12:13.527 --> 00:12:21.633]  And also we've got Rome who is sparing the Iranian president any blushes by covering the nude statues there.
[00:12:22.474 --> 00:12:26.917]  So we have the Iranian president visiting there and
[00:12:27.978 --> 00:12:35.765]  Just to avoid any possible offense on his visit to Rome, they've covered up these nude statues at the museum there.
[00:12:35.965 --> 00:12:36.986]  So, here we go.
[00:12:37.026 --> 00:12:38.488]  This is just how the world is.
[00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:49.458]  We capitulate to extremists and they're prepping us for that here in the United States by Congress giving all of its power away to whomever the next dictator will be.
[00:12:54.833 --> 00:13:06.537]  Now that the Bill of Rights have been largely destroyed by our corporatized government, President Obama has decided to go for the meat of the American Constitution, the War Powers of the Constitution.
[00:13:06.797 --> 00:13:21.763]  Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11 of the United States Constitution, sometimes referred to as the War Powers Clause, vests in the Congress the power to declare war.
[00:13:22.303 --> 00:13:23.384]  This resolution
[00:13:24.424 --> 00:13:30.427]  Is a total rewrite of the War Powers Clause of the United States Constitution.
[00:13:30.447 --> 00:13:31.668]  Let's be clear about that.
[00:13:32.288 --> 00:13:37.311]  It is essentially a declaration of international martial law.
[00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:45.175]  A sweeping transfer of military power to the President that will allow him or her to send U.S.
[00:13:45.395 --> 00:13:53.459]  troops almost anywhere in the world for almost any reason with absolutely no limitations.
[00:13:54.099 --> 00:14:08.913]  So while the East Coast was buried under record snowfall, Obama's faux Republican minions Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell scuttled another dangerous fast-track bill into the halls of the most hated Congress in U.S.
[00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:09.414]  history.
[00:14:09.854 --> 00:14:15.860]  The legislation makes the unconstitutional Iraq war authorization of 2002 look like a walk in the park.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:25.410]  It will allow this president and future presidents to wage war against ISIS without restrictions on time, geographic scope, or the use of ground troops.
[00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:33.338]  It is a completely open-ended authorization for the president to use the military as he wishes for as long as he or she wishes.
[00:14:34.156 --> 00:14:41.663]  Even President Obama has expressed concern over how willing Congress is to hand him unlimited power to wage war.
[00:14:41.944 --> 00:14:55.556]  The Foreign Relations Committee, whose chair is Senator Bob Corker, suggested that a new authorization for use of military force was unlikely to happen, and that President Obama currently has the legal authority he needs.
[00:14:56.317 --> 00:15:01.698]  Corker's authority was bypassed by McConnell's treasonous fast track.
[00:15:02.139 --> 00:15:04.879]  And Senator Lindsey Graham bleated out to reporters,
[00:15:14.682 --> 00:15:20.469]  I would be astonished that anybody seeking to be commander in chief wouldn't want this power.
[00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:27.338]  It would allow the administration to fight the terror group ISIS wherever, whenever, and however.
[00:15:27.798 --> 00:15:31.583]  As if the real threat of ISIS was a mystery to the American people.
[00:15:32.043 --> 00:15:38.466]  Most Americans are fully aware that our greatest threat lies in Obama's policies regarding immigration.
[00:15:38.887 --> 00:15:50.212]  The bill isn't even warm yet, and Vice President Joe Biden is in Turkey cheerleading World War III, presenting both sides of the issue to Turkey and the American people.
[00:15:50.572 --> 00:15:53.634]  Our allies in the region were our largest problem in Syria.
[00:15:54.414 --> 00:15:59.237]  The Turks were great friends, and I have a great relationship with Erdogan, which I've just spent a lot of time with.
[00:16:00.129 --> 00:16:10.997]  They poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens, thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad.
[00:16:11.518 --> 00:16:23.127]  Except that the people who were being supplied were al-Nusra and Al-Qaeda and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world.
[00:16:24.198 --> 00:16:43.351]  Following World War II, the United States leadership has continually sought to foment and drive the industrial-military complex machine into an unending unconstitutional state of global war, creating the very enemies Obama's dictatorial powers would seek to suppress.
[00:16:43.691 --> 00:16:51.637]  We have finally reached the precipice of the total annihilation of the balance of powers that act as the foundation of our republic.
[00:16:52.361 --> 00:16:57.305]  Let's not get involved in constitutional arguments.
[00:16:57.525 --> 00:17:11.616]  President Obama is desperately attempting to disarm the public and re-engineer the United States into a lawless military state overseen by corrupt politicians on par with the horror south of our border.
[00:17:12.116 --> 00:17:14.018]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:17:32.796 --> 00:17:36.940]  You traitors claiming I'm a Ruski agent, say it to my face and I'll break your nose.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:37.821]  I'm sick of it.
[00:17:38.061 --> 00:17:41.064]  I will stomp your head in the ground, you traitorous maggots.
[00:17:41.324 --> 00:17:54.516]  While we go under Obamacare, North American Union, conquered by European banks, announcing our kids don't belong to us, total bondage, total surveillance, and you want to shoot your mouth off about me being a Ruski agent, I will stomp your head in the ground.
[00:17:54.756 --> 00:18:00.499]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 proof.
[00:18:00.939 --> 00:18:04.821]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:18:04.841 --> 00:18:12.005]  I wish we'd go back to the days, I'm telling you, of getting my satisfaction out in the street.
[00:18:13.035 --> 00:18:14.776]  You pick a sword or something else.
[00:18:14.876 --> 00:18:15.796]  You're going down the street.
[00:18:16.316 --> 00:18:21.258]  Shane Steiner's involvement with InfoWarsLife.com truly happened in an organic way.
[00:18:21.378 --> 00:18:24.098]  I went to high school with Shane, his brother, knew his parents well.
[00:18:24.318 --> 00:18:29.980]  And he was visiting the office once, hadn't been to the office in years, and said, wow, I notice you're making and selling supplements.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.760]  Do these really work?
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.862]  Because I've tried a lot of supplements as a workout enthusiast, and I really think most of them are hype.
[00:18:35.902 --> 00:18:37.403]  And I said, here, take some home, try it.
[00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:44.048]  Well, a few weeks later, he came in, blown away, and said, I want to buy three boxes of this stuff to give my friends and family.
[00:18:44.468 --> 00:18:45.969]  It's simply amazing.
[00:18:46.009 --> 00:18:47.290]  He said, why does it work so well?
[00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:51.854]  And I said, listen, go to Infowarslife.com, watch the informational videos with Dr. Group and others.
[00:18:52.074 --> 00:18:53.575]  They understand how it all works.
[00:18:53.855 --> 00:18:55.436]  I know that it works for me.
[00:18:55.556 --> 00:18:56.697]  That's all I understand.
[00:18:56.957 --> 00:19:02.001]  The science, the facts, the research, people's testimonials, they're all on Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:02.021 --> 00:19:03.002]  You can check it out for yourself.
[00:19:03.602 --> 00:19:04.683]  I wanted to go to the gym.
[00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:14.788]  I wanted to push myself and work out harder, and that led to me being able to come out and do stuff like the barefooting and the surfing and stuff like that, which I would have never done.
[00:19:14.808 --> 00:19:17.329]  I never would have done that two years ago.
[00:19:17.929 --> 00:19:21.551]  Shane has said over and over again, more than just libido and energy,
[00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:23.873]  It made him want to get into the gym more.
[00:19:24.214 --> 00:19:25.675]  It made him want to get in better shape.
[00:19:25.715 --> 00:19:28.338]  And believe me, the Steiners have amazing genetics.
[00:19:28.879 --> 00:19:31.322]  His brother is a world champion steer wrestler.
[00:19:31.662 --> 00:19:35.647]  His dad, Bobby Steiner, is a famous world champion bull rider.
[00:19:35.847 --> 00:19:37.509]  They've got natural genetics.
[00:19:37.949 --> 00:19:42.675]  But when you added this to the mix, in Shane's own words, it took him to the next level.
[00:19:54.972 --> 00:19:56.673]  Shane noticed the mental clarity.
[00:19:57.134 --> 00:20:00.616]  Bobby was able to work out longer and gain muscle mass.
[00:20:00.736 --> 00:20:02.037]  He's already completely shredded.
[00:20:02.237 --> 00:20:04.899]  I gotta admit, for me, the biggest effect has been libido.
[00:20:05.259 --> 00:20:11.303]  Now, I've never claimed to have a body like some beach model, but back when I was 20, 22 years old and worked out every day, I looked great.
[00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:17.368]  But over the years and being married, having three kids, working 18 hours a day, I gained basically 100 pounds.
[00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:20.650]  And it's been a long process of losing that weight in the last four years.
[00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.392]  But if you look at the photos and the videos,
[00:20:23.752 --> 00:20:24.112]  We're good to go.
[00:20:42.837 --> 00:20:52.901]  This has actually made me feel so good that here lately, about a year ago, I started training jiu-jitsu and that kind of led to doing some boxing and kickboxing.
[00:20:52.921 --> 00:21:05.407]  I mean, it's amazing that two years ago I was on the couch and couldn't even tie my shoes and now I'm training with MMA fighters and just doing stuff that I never thought that I would be doing ever again.
[00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:07.528]  So, Supermail Vitality has
[00:21:08.408 --> 00:21:08.929]  I don't know.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.140]  You'll love it.
[00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:12.437]  Bottom line folks, you want to discover the power of super male vitality and super female vitality for yourself by visiting InfoWarsLife.com today or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:17.554 --> 00:22:26.264]  Well, one of former President Bill Clinton's mistresses has actually taken to her social media warning friends that she fears for her life.
[00:22:26.725 --> 00:22:37.497]  Now, this is the former Miss Arkansas Sally Miller, and she's posted, in this election year, if you read I died by committing suicide, don't believe it.
[00:22:38.098 --> 00:22:43.362]  Now she says she's familiar with the Clintons intimidation tactics since the 90s.
[00:22:44.002 --> 00:22:47.504]  This is the time she was physically threatened by a Clinton operative.
[00:22:48.065 --> 00:22:53.188]  They actually said they told her to be a good little girl and they offered her a federal job.
[00:22:53.568 --> 00:23:01.414]  If she didn't accept the offer then they knew that if she went jogging by herself and they couldn't guarantee what would happen to her pretty little legs.
[00:23:02.154 --> 00:23:05.338]  And she just said things weren't very fun for her anymore.
[00:23:05.398 --> 00:23:07.199]  They said life is going to get hard for you, girl.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:14.227]  Well, now she fears that she is being monitored while at her home and followed while she's visiting the park with her dog.
[00:23:14.287 --> 00:23:18.011]  She gets lots of instances where she's basically being gang stalked.
[00:23:18.531 --> 00:23:39.737]  Um, she said that people are coming to her door, people all of a sudden want to be her friend, trucks are going back and forth past her home with the tinted out windows, and she said, I know it sounds crazy, but this is the exact type of thing that was happening back in the 90s, and she has every reason to be concerned all over again because she's about to release a tell-all book
[00:23:40.237 --> 00:23:43.059]  The beauty queen let no good deed go unpublished.
[00:23:43.419 --> 00:23:54.146]  She's going to elaborate on her affair with the then Governor Bill Clinton and his numerous vices, including the regular smoking of marijuana and snorting of cocaine.
[00:23:54.667 --> 00:24:00.591]  Now, we've interviewed Clinton insider Larry Nichols, who has teared open the Clinton machine before.
[00:24:00.691 --> 00:24:09.817]  He's also alluded to these vices of the Clintons, as well as the connection there with trafficking cocaine into the United States.
[00:24:10.637 --> 00:24:13.278]  Just a colossal list of lies and deception.
[00:24:13.739 --> 00:24:14.699]  You can check that out.
[00:24:14.759 --> 00:24:16.120]  It's called the New Clinton Chronicles 2015.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.301]  That's an excellent Larry Nichols interview.
[00:24:20.562 --> 00:24:24.063]  But now we have a very influential CEO saying, you know what, it doesn't matter.
[00:24:24.083 --> 00:24:26.884]  It doesn't matter what is printed about Hillary.
[00:24:26.904 --> 00:24:29.425]  It doesn't matter what comes out about her, what anyone says.
[00:24:29.986 --> 00:24:33.727]  The 2016 presidential election has already been decided.
[00:24:34.268 --> 00:24:37.429]  And this is the highly influential CEO Martin Sorrell.
[00:24:37.949 --> 00:24:39.530]  And he says it doesn't matter about Trump.
[00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:40.990]  Hillary will win.
[00:24:42.131 --> 00:24:54.775]  This has been reported by the DC Whispers website and they say, you know, he is the single most influential and prominent marketing firm in the world with decades old ties to the most elite of the elite.
[00:24:54.815 --> 00:24:58.556]  He's the head of WPP PLC.
[00:24:59.696 --> 00:25:09.324]  Now they have ties to Fox News, which just check this out, WPP and its myriad of affiliates represent up to half of all Fox News ad revenue.
[00:25:09.645 --> 00:25:16.330]  Clients include corporate giants like Ford, GlaxoSmith, IBM, Microsoft, Nestle, Walmart, Unilever, etc.
[00:25:17.311 --> 00:25:29.535]  So, these are people who result in tens of millions of dollars in ad revenue, keeping the lights there of Fox News on, and also, of course, pays the salaries of on-air personalities like Megyn Kelly.
[00:25:29.955 --> 00:25:38.258]  So, when someone like Martin Sorrell signals that it doesn't matter who the Republicans nominate because Hillary Clinton is going to be the next president of the United States,
[00:25:39.478 --> 00:25:43.139]  It's a prediction or a threat that should be taken really seriously.
[00:25:43.559 --> 00:26:05.643]  And this is something that we actually alluded to in one of our documentaries, Obama Deception, where we talk about Obama and Clinton being sweeped up into one of these secretive closed-door meetings involving public servants, which means it's being paid for with your tax dollars, where the elite are deciding who will be the next puppet that they're going to roll out for the American people to choose from.
[00:26:06.263 --> 00:26:13.611]  Year after year, Estalin and other reporters like Jim Tucker are able to report on future events with stunning accuracy.
[00:26:14.051 --> 00:26:17.535]  All because they know the agenda of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:26:19.857 --> 00:26:24.301]  The Bilderberg Group sits at the top of the world power structure.
[00:26:24.321 --> 00:26:29.347]  125 of the richest and most influential individuals on the globe make up its membership.
[00:26:32.145 --> 00:26:37.894]  From Istanbul, Turkey to Chantilly, Virginia, we have tracked the elusive Bilderberg Group.
[00:26:41.687 --> 00:26:44.929]  Bilderberg always insists on a media blackout.
[00:26:45.629 --> 00:26:51.232]  By June of 2008, we had already figured out that Barack Obama was the elite's puppet of choice.
[00:26:51.673 --> 00:27:00.878]  The national media claimed that during the weekend the Bilderberg group was scheduled to meet, that Obama had speaking engagements set for Chicago and the Midwest.
[00:27:01.298 --> 00:27:01.939]  We knew better.
[00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:12.689]  In a classic bait-and-switch, the Obama campaign told the press corps to get on Obama's campaign plane and that Obama would join them on the flight to Chicago.
[00:27:13.049 --> 00:27:15.892]  Campaign staff then slammed the door shut.
[00:27:16.313 --> 00:27:22.379]  The fawning press had been shanghaied as Obama's campaign aircraft lifted off without Obama.
[00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:31.653]  Robert, why were we not told about this meeting and that the Senator wouldn't be on our flight until the doors were shut and we were about to taxi to take off?
[00:27:35.766 --> 00:27:36.666]  We had a desire.
[00:27:36.686 --> 00:27:40.107]  Senator Obama had a desire to do some meetings.
[00:27:40.207 --> 00:27:43.568]  Others had a desire to meet with him tonight in a private way.
[00:27:43.869 --> 00:27:45.129]  And that's what we're doing.
[00:27:45.169 --> 00:27:46.249]  We set up these meetings.
[00:27:46.809 --> 00:27:48.290]  They're being done tonight.
[00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:54.112]  Again, I'm... Is there more than one meeting?
[00:27:54.392 --> 00:27:55.732]  Is there more than one person?
[00:27:56.292 --> 00:27:58.433]  I'm not going to get into all the details of the meetings.
[00:27:58.453 --> 00:28:00.914]  I don't know that I've got a ton more
[00:28:02.065 --> 00:28:04.367]  Different answers for all of your questions.
[00:28:04.687 --> 00:28:06.648]  Obama wasn't going to Chicago.
[00:28:06.988 --> 00:28:08.449]  He had a meeting to attend.
[00:28:08.869 --> 00:28:09.810]  A secret meeting.
[00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:14.253]  Initially it was believed that the secret meeting took place at Clinton's Washington D.C.
[00:28:14.313 --> 00:28:14.573]  home.
[00:28:14.933 --> 00:28:18.936]  Obama's spokesman denied that, but won't confirm where the former rivals met.
[00:28:19.356 --> 00:28:22.038]  He also declined to comment on their topics of discussion.
[00:28:23.052 --> 00:28:29.976]  For a day and a half, the mainstream media engaged in a wild goose chase, trying to find out where Hillary and Obama had gone.
[00:28:30.356 --> 00:28:37.380]  Three cover stories later, the corporate press had to admit they had no idea where the two candidates had gone.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:41.402]  And to this day, Clinton and Obama aren't talking.
[00:28:42.023 --> 00:28:49.427]  Plenty of sources knew about this meeting, told us and others that it was at Hillary Clinton's house, but clearly it wasn't.
[00:28:49.912 --> 00:28:55.860]  In 2008, the trail led us to the Westfields Marriott Hotel, right outside Washington D.C.
[00:28:58.646 --> 00:29:00.287]  We just flew into Washington, D.C.
[00:29:01.068 --> 00:29:02.969]  We're driving to the Westfields Marriott.
[00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:07.673]  Tomorrow the hotel's closed throughout the week and in the weekend for the Bilderberg Group meeting.
[00:29:08.233 --> 00:29:09.714]  We're going to check in the night before.
[00:29:09.754 --> 00:29:10.995]  They're going to kick us out tomorrow.
[00:29:11.515 --> 00:29:13.737]  So we're going directly into the belly of the beast.
[00:29:14.177 --> 00:29:17.680]  The hotel will be filled with at least five spy agencies.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:23.284]  CIA, Defense Intelligence, Facade, European Union Security.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:31.987]  We checked into the Westfields Marriott 48 hours before hotel guests were scheduled to be thrown out ahead of the annual meeting.
[00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:42.277]  The building was nestled in the heart of the military-industrial complex, with the National Reconnaissance Office and Raytheon just a stone's throw away.
[00:29:45.703 --> 00:29:58.211]  Robert David Steele joined the Alex Jones Show today where he talks about this Clinton cover-up via the mainstream media and also about the fact that now Bloomberg is wanting to throw his hat into the presidential race.
[00:29:58.251 --> 00:30:07.057]  I guess he's jealous of the other billionaire who's up there doing very well, thinking that he can do a better job of implementing the nanny state nationwide.
[00:30:07.498 --> 00:30:15.123]  So this is Robert David Steele's take on this Clinton cover-up and should we be worried about a Bloomberg president?
[00:30:16.275 --> 00:30:33.280]  I believe that it's time now for someone like Governor Kasich and Governor Abbott and maybe even Governor O'Malley to come out and point out to America that 60% of the electoral public has been disenfranchised by the two-party tyranny.
[00:30:33.861 --> 00:30:43.864]  And if we go into a new election, let's say Mike Bloomberg runs, that's actually good because he'll pull votes from Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, who I consider a fraud.
[00:30:44.606 --> 00:30:49.369]  Um, but the bottom line here is we need a clean sheet, fresh start.
[00:30:49.389 --> 00:30:53.791]  By the way, Bloomberg, as you predicted last week, came out three days later and said he may run.
[00:30:53.811 --> 00:30:57.613]  Uh, and of course we've also got Biden talking about running now.
[00:30:57.993 --> 00:30:59.554]  Uh, what's your view on Hillary?
[00:30:59.594 --> 00:31:01.195]  I mean, she is in so much trouble.
[00:31:01.435 --> 00:31:03.656]  She's having, in fact we have the video, coughing fits.
[00:31:04.076 --> 00:31:04.657]  She looks...
[00:31:05.297 --> 00:31:06.458]  Let me be crystal clear.
[00:31:06.498 --> 00:31:09.780]  I think Hillary Clinton is a dishonest, incompetent toad.
[00:31:11.401 --> 00:31:14.022]  She has absolutely no redeeming virtues.
[00:31:14.463 --> 00:31:19.565]  She kicked Al Gore out of the vice president's office in the old executive office building.
[00:31:20.026 --> 00:31:23.568]  She treats people very, very badly.
[00:31:24.128 --> 00:31:29.091]  All of my Secret Service contacts say that they will never ever again work for her.
[00:31:29.531 --> 00:31:34.354]  She is a dishonest, mean, cruel, selfish person.
[00:31:34.814 --> 00:31:39.576]  I absolutely think that anybody who votes for Hillary Clinton is an idiot.
[00:31:39.877 --> 00:31:45.520]  I have interviewed Jim Tucker, the late great Jim Tucker that exposed Bilderberg, which is the secret Davos for new viewers and listeners.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.901]  He said that they tell people do not look in her eyes.
[00:31:49.542 --> 00:31:50.402]  She doesn't tip.
[00:31:50.582 --> 00:31:53.723]  She treats the smallest people and tells them you are scum.
[00:31:54.164 --> 00:31:55.904]  She is so hateful even to her staff.
[00:31:56.245 --> 00:32:01.987]  They said and then I had a chance infiltrating Bilderberg quite a few times to actually then go back the days after.
[00:32:02.287 --> 00:32:07.450]  Now they just close it for days after so I have trouble and talk to the staff who wouldn't talk to me especially English speakers in Virginia.
[00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:13.833]  And the police and everybody, and the first few days they won't talk to us, but then after that they go, oh here's the documents, they're horrible.
[00:32:14.113 --> 00:32:15.194]  We've never been treated so bad.
[00:32:15.234 --> 00:32:16.074]  These are evil men.
[00:32:16.294 --> 00:32:18.155]  It's like a James Bond movie is what they say.
[00:32:18.175 --> 00:32:18.835]  Is that Spectre?
[00:32:27.142 --> 00:32:36.406]  You guys have the exclusive for which is a product called Deep Cleanse and why I'm so excited about it is it's a unique formula almost like the iodine crystals.
[00:32:36.506 --> 00:32:40.268]  We have two unique products that nobody in the world has.
[00:32:40.648 --> 00:32:52.434]  One of the most amazing ingredients in the world and it's called Shilajit and it's actually known as blood of the mountain or rock sweat because thousands of years ago, as a matter of fact, this ingredient
[00:32:52.634 --> 00:32:59.038]  Was only given to the elite of the elite thousands of years ago up in the Himalayan mountains and in Tibet.
[00:32:59.078 --> 00:33:02.901]  And we wanted to put this in stuff for a couple years, but we couldn't get an organic form.
[00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:03.301]  Right.
[00:33:03.401 --> 00:33:04.422]  I mean, let's explain.
[00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:07.624]  I mean, this stuff's so good, we couldn't put it out for years.
[00:33:07.904 --> 00:33:16.353]  Right, so I had to actually, it's kind of like the iodine crystals, finding a source deep in the earth that we could get the cleanest source available.
[00:33:16.793 --> 00:33:26.363]  But in Tibet and in Nepal and in the Himalayan mountains, thousands of years ago they found, they watched these monkeys and during the summer months the monkeys would go up into the mountains.
[00:33:26.384 --> 00:33:27.625]  Now you're being racist against monkeys.
[00:33:27.665 --> 00:33:28.306]  And they would pick
[00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:31.207]  This black substance from the mountains.
[00:33:31.668 --> 00:33:38.171]  And so in Russia, they actually, it grows in Russia and the mountains and in the Himalayas and only in the summer.
[00:33:38.272 --> 00:33:46.476]  And shilajit is actually the decomposition of up to 7,000 different medicinal herbs.
[00:33:46.536 --> 00:33:53.200]  So it decomposes, all these different herbs decompose in the Himalayan mountains and the volcanic soil up there.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.483]  And what happens in the summertime... So it's almost like an oil from
[00:33:58.343 --> 00:34:01.046]  Yes, it's high in fulvic acid, it's high in humic acid.
[00:34:01.086 --> 00:34:05.411]  Because they're always claiming oil is really from decomposed animals and plants.
[00:34:05.972 --> 00:34:10.417]  There is some oil that is based from fossils, but most of it's really abiotic.
[00:34:10.818 --> 00:34:14.823]  So this is a true fossil source?
[00:34:14.843 --> 00:34:15.583]  I mean, explain it to me.
[00:34:16.284 --> 00:34:16.624]  It is.
[00:34:17.024 --> 00:34:22.345]  It's really the decomposition, like I said, of over 7,000 different medicinal herbs and plants.
[00:34:22.505 --> 00:34:26.306]  And with the rocks and the pressure deep in the mountains, it freezes.
[00:34:26.386 --> 00:34:31.327]  And during the summertime and the pressures build it up, it oozes out.
[00:34:31.427 --> 00:34:33.007]  So it literally oozes out of the mountain.
[00:34:33.027 --> 00:34:33.827]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:34.187 --> 00:34:35.188]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:35.228 --> 00:34:38.348]  It's black and it's highly nutritious.
[00:34:39.188 --> 00:34:41.809]  Even in the 1980s, when the Olympic
[00:34:42.529 --> 00:34:44.850]  Athletes in Russia were accused of being on steroids.
[00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:52.231]  They found out that they were actually been given Shilajit because it works as an anabolic as well and it builds muscles.
[00:34:52.431 --> 00:34:53.491]  It's a big dose in there.
[00:34:53.511 --> 00:35:03.234]  The second big main ingredient in there is a volcanic zeolite concentrate and what this formula is designed to do, the Shilajit and the zeolites have a real strong negative charge.
[00:35:03.694 --> 00:35:08.615]  All the metals and chemicals and PCBs and VOCs have positive charges.
[00:35:09.415 --> 00:35:17.522]  So these go in, they grab it, and then they safely eliminate it through the body so you can become healthy.
[00:35:17.563 --> 00:35:21.506]  I mean, this is an amazing formula.
[00:35:21.646 --> 00:35:27.512]  I wish I actually had it, but because this was an exclusive InfoWars Life product, you're the only one in the world that has.
[00:35:28.132 --> 00:35:36.039]  This formula now and, you know, there is going to be a limited supply available when you sell out because you can only harvest this once a year.
[00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:37.260]  How do people take it?
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.622]  How is it recommended that this be done?
[00:35:39.722 --> 00:35:41.424]  Just a daily dose?
[00:35:41.704 --> 00:35:43.446]  Yeah, daily dose.
[00:35:43.526 --> 00:35:44.907]  The instructions are on the label.
[00:35:44.927 --> 00:35:48.330]  You know, of course, I kind of modify it for each individual.
[00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:49.931]  It depends on what your lifestyle is.
[00:35:49.971 --> 00:35:55.076]  I mean, honestly, the best thing to do is for you to avoid all these chemicals and toxins in your environment.
[00:35:55.376 --> 00:35:55.456]  Yeah.
[00:36:17.495 --> 00:36:18.395]  These aren't just great products.
[00:36:18.415 --> 00:36:20.196]  This is how we fund this independent operation.
[00:36:20.216 --> 00:36:25.418]  We're not taxpayer-funded, like MSNBC or NPR, and neither is your local station, so support them, folks.
[00:36:25.618 --> 00:36:26.239]  This is a war.
[00:36:30.956 --> 00:36:35.519]  Is there anything that can unseat Hillary Rodham Clinton?
[00:36:35.619 --> 00:36:42.704]  And out of all the players, you know, Bernie Sanders talks about inequity but doesn't tell people why it's crony capitalism.
[00:36:43.604 --> 00:36:46.886]  We, you know, Hillary we know is the consummate insider saying she's not.
[00:36:47.787 --> 00:36:48.988]  You know, what do you think of Ted Cruz?
[00:36:49.008 --> 00:36:50.008]  What do you think of Donald Trump?
[00:36:50.269 --> 00:36:52.090]  What's your take on election 2016 from Red Square?
[00:36:54.952 --> 00:36:59.114]  Well Alex, you know, we entered really a vortex a few weeks ago.
[00:36:59.554 --> 00:37:04.397]  The events horizon was crossed when Donald Trump was on Alex Jones.
[00:37:05.057 --> 00:37:17.764]  And what I mean by that is you've been in the trenches for years developing this audience of an alternative media with an alternative voice and here's a presidential candidate who realizes that mainstream media is a complete waste of time and he goes on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:37:18.351 --> 00:37:29.835]  Now, Bernie Sanders, on the other side of the aisle, also realizes that he can reach out with an audience of alternative media as well, and he gets enormous traction.
[00:37:29.895 --> 00:37:31.676]  But this is a presidential election.
[00:37:31.996 --> 00:37:35.878]  We're going to sweep out all the old, and we're bringing in the new.
[00:37:35.918 --> 00:37:41.480]  I think Hillary Clinton is toast, and I think that Donald Trump is going to be the Republican nominee.
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.521]  64% now of Republicans think that Trump's going to be the nominee.
[00:37:45.126 --> 00:37:53.698]  Personally, I'd like to see Trump get in the White House because I think he would be the right billionaire at the right time to kick out the other billionaires.
[00:37:53.738 --> 00:38:02.770]  Remember, Vladimir Putin had to kick out the kleptocrats when he came into office in the early 90s, and the Russian economy benefited as a result.
[00:38:03.638 --> 00:38:05.219]  Putin is anti-kleptocrat.
[00:38:05.259 --> 00:38:06.420]  He's anti-oligarch.
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:07.681]  Same thing with Trump.
[00:38:07.741 --> 00:38:16.808]  If Trump gets in, he will kick out the other oligarchs, the Michael Bloombergs, the billionaires that are ruling and destroying America, the Koch brothers.
[00:38:17.268 --> 00:38:17.989]  He'll get rid of them.
[00:38:18.309 --> 00:38:18.609]  That's my
[00:38:18.809 --> 00:38:22.712]  And by the way, he said he likes Putin and what he's done, kicking out the cronies.
[00:38:23.133 --> 00:38:27.716]  And so, I don't usually say, man on a white horse, you know, I want some guy, a strong man to save me.
[00:38:27.956 --> 00:38:31.839]  We're already having them try to give people martial law and no one cares.
[00:38:31.859 --> 00:38:36.243]  I mean, we've reached such a crisis point that we know Jeb Bush and Hillary ain't it.
[00:38:36.623 --> 00:38:43.789]  I mean, you know, there's no way Trump could possibly be, and you know, I don't want to say behind the scenes stuff, but Trump claims he's aware of almost everything, basically.
[00:38:44.738 --> 00:38:58.486]  Look, we had in America the robber barons who were anxious to destroy America, and Teddy Roosevelt assumed the White House, and he destroyed, he became the trust buster, and he swept out the Plutarch Act.
[00:38:58.526 --> 00:39:00.207]  The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1906.
[00:39:00.568 --> 00:39:05.090]  And he broke up the oil company, Standard Oil, etc.
[00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:12.875]  A lot of people in his class thought he betrayed his class because he's a rich guy, the Roosevelt family, very rich Fifth Avenue family.
[00:39:13.157 --> 00:39:16.998]  But he assumed power and he kicked out the oligarchs, the robber barons, as they were called.
[00:39:17.298 --> 00:39:18.359]  And that's what America needed.
[00:39:18.379 --> 00:39:21.480]  That's what I thought Obama was going to do when he came into office.
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:25.901]  I thought he was going to, you know, throw down and get rid of a lot of these crony capitalists.
[00:39:26.001 --> 00:39:26.921]  I wouldn't even care.
[00:39:26.982 --> 00:39:34.184]  I mean, I'd care less if we had some robber barons that actually wanted to hire people like Henry Ford and actually said, I pay people so they can buy a car.
[00:39:34.204 --> 00:39:37.005]  I mean, it's like these are anti-free market.
[00:39:37.825 --> 00:39:42.006]  I mean, look at Obama going to Africa saying, you can't have cars, you can't have air conditioning.
[00:39:42.206 --> 00:39:44.646]  Why not say, we're going to develop clean cars and air conditioning?
[00:39:44.826 --> 00:39:48.467]  I mean, just to say it, from Air Force One on a red carpet.
[00:39:49.827 --> 00:39:58.509]  Well, what we have in this century is the billionaire class that uses financial products and financialization.
[00:39:58.529 --> 00:40:05.210]  So it's different than Henry Ford, who manufactured cars, and there's something tangible about that, and there was a manufacturing base.
[00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:06.370]  But here you have billionaires
[00:40:06.809 --> 00:40:13.713]  That have gotten their billions through flipping paper, through stocks and bonds and financialization and derivatives.
[00:40:14.033 --> 00:40:16.315]  And that adds absolutely nothing to the economy.
[00:40:16.355 --> 00:40:19.517]  And they're entrenched in the system along with the central bank.
[00:40:19.897 --> 00:40:32.345]  But as I said earlier, it's remarkable that Deutsche Bank and other bankers are begging Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank to stop printing money because he's doing more harm than good.
[00:40:32.705 --> 00:40:35.687]  I've been saying it on your show for several years now that printing money
[00:40:36.127 --> 00:40:37.588]  It causes deflation.
[00:40:38.028 --> 00:40:39.828]  It doesn't fight deflation.
[00:40:40.229 --> 00:40:43.990]  Now Deutsche Bank and other bankers are agreeing with what I've been saying on your show for years.
[00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:53.634]  All the money printing, all it does, it supports the zombie banks who use all their free money to just roll over all of the debt that's no good.
[00:40:53.694 --> 00:40:54.774]  It's junk debt.
[00:40:54.814 --> 00:40:57.455]  They should be allowed to fail if, in fact, this was a free market.
[00:40:57.735 --> 00:41:02.377]  But by keeping them propped up with all the money printing, they are a huge impediment
[00:41:03.092 --> 00:41:03.352]  Sure.
[00:41:03.372 --> 00:41:04.233]  What are the next triggers?
[00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:27.517]  But the transportation index, which is an index of stocks tied to transportation, it's also gone down.
[00:41:27.918 --> 00:41:33.184]  Usually if the price of oil goes down, transportation companies go up or people benefit from a lower
[00:41:34.048 --> 00:41:34.729]  Let's go further!
[00:41:52.302 --> 00:42:00.365]  As the old companies got caught by the AP in 2000 on a six-year plan that went back to 94, the Big Ten kept meeting in New York and in other U.S.
[00:42:00.405 --> 00:42:00.785]  cities.
[00:42:01.325 --> 00:42:05.246]  In their lawsuit, they got the documents saying, we're going to have wildcatters in the future.
[00:42:05.646 --> 00:42:08.787]  They predicted the shale market coming up, the tar sands.
[00:42:08.827 --> 00:42:13.669]  They said, we've got to get fake environmentalists that we fund to shut down.
[00:42:13.689 --> 00:42:14.409]  This is in the documents.
[00:42:15.222 --> 00:42:18.885]  To shut down all these new refineries and don't let new ones get opened.
[00:42:19.166 --> 00:42:27.673]  So even if the Saudis or somebody have a war, and they saw this 17, 18 years ago, and lower prices, we will create an artificial bottleneck.
[00:42:27.713 --> 00:42:31.677]  So gas should be like a dollar a gallon now.
[00:42:31.757 --> 00:42:33.219]  That would actually help the economy.
[00:42:33.239 --> 00:42:39.965]  It hurts a bunch of other areas of the economy to have oil that low, but it should be translating like a dollar ten, okay, or a dollar twenty.
[00:42:40.405 --> 00:42:40.986]  No, it's not.
[00:42:41.006 --> 00:42:43.608]  So we're getting both.
[00:42:44.049 --> 00:42:55.940]  Oil's really plunging in the real market, but by the time we get it, it's so rigged, we're still paying way more than we should, because the oil companies have the refineries, and so it doesn't matter if there's a glut, they've suspended reality yet again, Kaiser.
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:57.261]  A double screwjob.
[00:42:57.321 --> 00:42:58.402]  Two points, two points.
[00:42:58.462 --> 00:42:58.983]  Number one.
[00:42:59.823 --> 00:43:02.585]  You made there in terms of the gas price.
[00:43:03.546 --> 00:43:13.273]  But the important thing to remember is that behind this industry is a structured financial market of bonds that are all now
[00:43:14.281 --> 00:43:17.783]  Unable to pay their interest payments and they're all collapsing.
[00:43:18.163 --> 00:43:21.425]  So this is causing a chain reaction.
[00:43:21.445 --> 00:43:24.526]  And all these other loans to the Wildcatters are going belly up.
[00:43:24.986 --> 00:43:30.489]  Deutsche Bank is a huge lender to the oil business and that's why it's going down.
[00:43:30.529 --> 00:43:33.090]  Now you mentioned the shale industry for a second.
[00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:39.453]  The shale industry in America was not even profitable when oil was $80 a barrel.
[00:43:39.713 --> 00:43:42.755]  The whole shale so-called revolution was a hoax because
[00:43:43.405 --> 00:43:52.498]  The life of an average shale project does not last long enough to pay the debt that you need to borrow.
[00:43:52.818 --> 00:43:54.180]  It was an investor hoax.
[00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:56.331]  It is a hoax.
[00:43:56.391 --> 00:43:58.614]  There's always cash flow negative from day one.
[00:43:58.914 --> 00:44:00.937]  And that's when oil was $80 a barrel.
[00:44:01.217 --> 00:44:14.573]  Now with oil at $30 a barrel, not only are you getting a negative cash flow on all the shale rigs in America, but all the junk bonds and now all the banks that lent, like the Deutsche Bank or all these money center banks that lent into this hoax, they're now collapsing.
[00:44:14.953 --> 00:44:17.894]  So it doesn't matter if gas price goes to 20 cents a gallon.
[00:44:18.614 --> 00:44:29.716]  If in fact the credit market sees up completely like in 2008, which is now going to happen again, that's the least of your worry, is that you're going to pay 50 cents a gallon of gas.
[00:44:29.736 --> 00:44:33.617]  And then the property tax market goes belly up because they're not getting all that oil and gas money.
[00:44:33.877 --> 00:44:39.418]  Because they'll bring in capital controls, bail-ins, bank seizures, money seizures.
[00:44:39.438 --> 00:44:41.899]  So why are you paying 50 cents a gallon if the bank just
[00:44:42.319 --> 00:44:45.321]  Just took all the money out of your account like they did in Cyprus.
[00:44:45.781 --> 00:44:46.861]  You know, it doesn't matter.
[00:44:46.941 --> 00:44:48.042]  And so you're saying that's coming.
[00:44:48.062 --> 00:44:48.802]  They just took all your money!
[00:44:49.062 --> 00:44:50.143]  That brings me to the next point.
[00:44:50.503 --> 00:44:51.664]  We played this video twice.
[00:44:51.684 --> 00:44:52.924]  I'm not going to play it again right now.
[00:44:53.024 --> 00:44:54.705]  We'll play it next hour with David Knight's in.
[00:44:55.165 --> 00:44:55.766]  But video.
[00:44:55.826 --> 00:45:02.029]  Senator Warren's authorization to use military force bill is declaration of international martial law.
[00:45:02.529 --> 00:45:06.111]  And it's Mitch McConnell, the Republicans are handing Obama and the next president
[00:45:07.682 --> 00:45:14.049]  What even Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy calls a declaration of international martial law.
[00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:18.014]  The resolution is a total rewrite of the War Powers Clause of the Constitution.
[00:45:18.054 --> 00:45:20.016]  We have Ron Paul saying the same thing.
[00:45:20.096 --> 00:45:21.258]  We said this last week.
[00:45:21.878 --> 00:45:22.940]  He said this last week.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.862]  I didn't even know he said it until last night.
[00:45:25.322 --> 00:45:27.184]  No coverage, Max Keiser.
[00:45:27.365 --> 00:45:28.346]  That's two big stories.
[00:45:28.766 --> 00:45:35.051]  The biggest War Powers Act, bigger than World War II, unlimited, insane, and it's not even in the news.
[00:45:35.391 --> 00:45:37.432]  I hope you cover it on your big RT show.
[00:45:37.773 --> 00:45:38.653]  I hope this gets out.
[00:45:38.873 --> 00:45:42.616]  This should be big news for the Russians right here, with NATO knocking on your door.
[00:45:42.636 --> 00:45:52.923]  Well, yeah, NATO is the aggressor, and, you know, part of the problem is that Victoria Nuland, her husband, is a lobbyist for Monsanto.
[00:45:53.243 --> 00:45:56.446]  Monsanto, genetically modified seeds, they want to get into Ukraine.
[00:45:57.111 --> 00:46:04.217]  Vladimir Putin, who works right over there in the Kremlin, has said that he doesn't want genetically modified seeds anywhere near Russia.
[00:46:04.818 --> 00:46:06.339]  He thinks that it's a disaster.
[00:46:06.359 --> 00:46:08.481]  He wants to be the global leader in organic food.
[00:46:09.142 --> 00:46:09.842]  That's what he says.
[00:46:11.784 --> 00:46:14.867]  Just to be official, you pretty much are endorsing Trump overall?
[00:46:16.288 --> 00:46:18.170]  I prefer Trump, yes.
[00:46:19.315 --> 00:46:19.897]  Well, that's news!
[00:46:19.957 --> 00:46:24.628]  Famous stockbroker, author, TV host Max Keiser, known to be a little bit more liberal, endorses Donald Trump.
[00:46:24.849 --> 00:46:26.252]  We've got to get that on the nightly news tonight.
[00:46:26.834 --> 00:46:28.598]  Thank you, my friend, for being on with us.

[00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:17.490]  PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:47:47.426 --> 00:47:48.127]  The Reporters.

[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:50.511]  What I'm going to talk about today is the open betrayal of the Constitution in terms of the fast tracking of the dissolution of Congress.
[00:48:51.141 --> 00:48:54.803]  Now we've talked earlier today, and Alex has played it several times, I'm going to play it again.
[00:48:54.823 --> 00:49:04.530]  This authorization for the use of military force, and the Senator, who last week as it was being introduced, said this is a call for international martial law.
[00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:07.592]  He said, I understand that we need to move after ISIS.
[00:49:07.692 --> 00:49:11.855]  I support that goal as well, but this is the wrong way to go about it.
[00:49:12.779 --> 00:49:15.702]  It's a way to go about it that voids the Constitution.
[00:49:16.042 --> 00:49:16.963]  And it's not just that.
[00:49:17.403 --> 00:49:19.545]  I've got a clip that I'm going to play before I play that clip.
[00:49:20.046 --> 00:49:28.634]  On the same day, another senator, this is a Democrat senator, by the way, the guy who opposed that was a Democrat senator from Connecticut.
[00:49:28.654 --> 00:49:29.194]  Good for him.
[00:49:29.635 --> 00:49:30.095]  Good for him.
[00:49:30.575 --> 00:49:34.939]  And it's very important when we see somebody who goes against their party leaders
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:36.160]  For principle.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.241]  For the Constitution.
[00:49:37.281 --> 00:49:41.462]  And I want to say that we need to strongly stand behind him on this particular issue.
[00:49:41.482 --> 00:49:46.824]  It's not to say that we're going to give him a blank check on every particular issue and a blanket endorsement for him.
[00:49:46.864 --> 00:49:48.125]  We don't ever do that with anybody.
[00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:48.745]  Understand that.
[00:49:49.365 --> 00:49:54.027]  We pick people issue by issue and say I support him on this issue, I don't support him over here.
[00:49:54.647 --> 00:49:57.548]  And we need to criticize people when they do the wrong thing.
[00:49:57.568 --> 00:49:59.269]  We need to pat them on the back when they do the right thing.
[00:49:59.309 --> 00:49:59.949]  Now here's a senator
[00:50:00.609 --> 00:50:01.469]  Who does the wrong thing?
[00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:03.130]  Senator Barbara Mikulski.
[00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:04.711]  She's been there forever in Maryland.
[00:50:05.292 --> 00:50:26.563]  And when they're talking about, and this is again, on Wednesday, the same day, that Mitch McConnell is introducing this fast-track authorization to do an international martial law to give the President carte blanche to go anywhere for as long as he wishes, without any justification, without any authorization from Congress, no time limit, no constraints of any time, geography, or anything.
[00:50:26.683 --> 00:50:26.924]  Okay?
[00:50:26.944 --> 00:50:28.905]  We're just creating a Caesar here.
[00:50:29.505 --> 00:50:30.666]  We're crossing the Rubicon.
[00:50:31.327 --> 00:50:39.077]  On that same day that that is introduced, we have Barbara Mikulski say this about Obama's executive orders.
[00:50:40.535 --> 00:50:43.197]  Mr. Chairman, I look forward, though, not to me talking.
[00:50:43.217 --> 00:50:44.658]  I'm listening to myself.
[00:50:45.038 --> 00:50:46.539]  I'm listening to the Attorney General.
[00:50:46.639 --> 00:50:51.103]  I'm listening to this wonderful panel that you've invited to participate today.
[00:50:51.583 --> 00:50:52.904]  So let's solve the problem.
[00:50:53.644 --> 00:50:56.146]  Let's not get involved in constitutional arguments.
[00:50:56.787 --> 00:51:03.812]  And let's help our American people be safe and secure in their home, their neighborhood, their school, and their house of worship.
[00:51:04.781 --> 00:51:13.270]  Let's not get involved in constitutional arguments and let's help our American people be safe and secure.
[00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:16.814]  Do you think you're going to be safe and secure if you don't have a constitution that protects your rights?
[00:51:17.375 --> 00:51:21.399]  If you have no legal rights that are respected by the government, the whole point...
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:22.340]  I don't know.
[00:51:39.039 --> 00:51:42.822]  That the federal government is not going to be the ruler of us.
[00:51:43.622 --> 00:51:47.445]  That we're giving it limited powers, that we're reserving powers to ourselves.
[00:51:47.465 --> 00:51:49.066]  So let's make that very clear.
[00:51:49.906 --> 00:51:55.390]  And so they enumerate that in eight amendments, specific things that they're protecting and laying that out.
[00:51:55.430 --> 00:52:03.956]  And then they put in two more, the ninth and the tenth, to make it abundantly clear that if we haven't expressly given you this power, then you don't have it.
[00:52:04.396 --> 00:52:07.979]  But of course, Barbara Mikulski says, well, you know, let's not have
[00:52:08.499 --> 00:52:11.180]  Let's not get involved in any constitutional arguments.
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:13.041]  Let's just make ourselves safe and secure.
[00:52:14.042 --> 00:52:18.944]  That is the lie that they continually sell you as part of the national security state.
[00:52:19.465 --> 00:52:21.205]  So now let's play on the same day.
[00:52:21.946 --> 00:52:32.991]  This is a reaction to what was also introduced that same day by Mitch McConnell, a Republican, who introduced this bill for international martial law.
[00:52:33.091 --> 00:52:36.793]  And this is what the, again, a Democrat senator opposed that.
[00:52:36.853 --> 00:52:37.914]  Let's hear what he had to say again.
[00:52:38.336 --> 00:52:44.341]  I want to speak very briefly about a resolution that the majority leader introduced, I believe, earlier today.
[00:52:44.381 --> 00:52:54.110]  This is an authorization for military force, is a total rewrite of the War Powers Clause of the United States Constitution.
[00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:55.351]  Let's be clear about that.
[00:52:55.971 --> 00:53:02.937]  It is essentially a declaration of international martial law, a sweeping transfer
[00:53:03.718 --> 00:53:08.840]  of military power to the President that will allow him or her to send U.S.
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:17.143]  troops almost anywhere in the world for almost any reason with absolutely no limitations.
[00:53:18.064 --> 00:53:23.466]  It's safe to say that this resolution is the wrong way to authorize war against ISIS.
[00:53:23.546 --> 00:53:28.568]  The language of this resolution is dangerous and it is unprecedented.
[00:53:29.594 --> 00:53:32.676]  Okay, so he is making a very clear point.
[00:53:32.736 --> 00:53:34.497]  Ron Paul made the same point.
[00:53:34.517 --> 00:53:41.741]  If you take a look at the article that we have on this, Ron Paul says, and we quote him in the article where we cover that video, that video is embedded.
[00:53:41.761 --> 00:53:42.961]  You can see the entire speech.
[00:53:43.301 --> 00:53:46.203]  You go to Infowars.com where he says, this resolution
[00:53:46.283 --> 00:53:50.926]  It's a total rewrite of the War Powers Clause of the Constitution.
[00:53:50.946 --> 00:53:52.167]  Let's be clear about that.
[00:53:52.187 --> 00:53:53.989]  That's Democrat Senator Chris Murphy.
[00:53:54.409 --> 00:53:56.951]  That is SJ Resolution 29.
[00:53:57.191 --> 00:54:00.593]  He says it is essentially a declaration of international martial law.
[00:54:01.034 --> 00:54:02.395]  And of course, what are they doing with it?
[00:54:02.875 --> 00:54:04.656]  They are fast tracking it.
[00:54:05.317 --> 00:54:06.297]  Where have we heard that before?
[00:54:06.898 --> 00:54:09.760]  We've heard the word fast track used over and over again, haven't we?
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:22.295]  If they can't do a document dump of a several thousand page bill and say we've only got 24 hours to do it, we've got to pass this omnibus bill or the government is going to shut down, there's no time to read this.
[00:54:22.615 --> 00:54:27.902]  We did it with Obamacare and we have done it repeatedly with Boehner and the rest of these people.
[00:54:28.723 --> 00:54:40.271]  Dumping this out, not giving anybody time to take a look at it, and of course that's precisely what they're going to do with the trade deals that are going to be hitting the Congress very shortly, because this has been floating around.
[00:54:40.311 --> 00:54:44.874]  They said we finished this, they did that back, I think it was in December, they said they had finished it.
[00:54:45.554 --> 00:54:50.597]  And we're just waiting for that to be introduced, and of course they have already said they're going to fast-track this.
[00:54:51.598 --> 00:54:55.441]  They are going to do the same thing in terms of the Constitution ignoring it,
[00:54:56.578 --> 00:54:59.419]  They're eviscerating it, and this is Congress doing it to itself.
[00:54:59.499 --> 00:55:08.663]  Imagine if we had a King George III that dissolved the American legislature, dissolved Parliament, or we had a czar who dissolved the Duca, okay?
[00:55:08.703 --> 00:55:11.724]  We got the Congress who's doing it to themselves.
[00:55:11.764 --> 00:55:13.525]  They're eviscerating their own powers.
[00:55:13.785 --> 00:55:20.148]  They have passed all of their legislating powers, their power to tax, their power to write laws.
[00:55:20.208 --> 00:55:22.188]  They have passed that off to the bureaucracies.
[00:55:22.208 --> 00:55:23.209]  They're proud of that.
[00:55:24.409 --> 00:55:29.271]  81,000 pages of legislation passed by the bureaucracy just last year.
[00:55:29.431 --> 00:55:29.912]  A new record.
[00:55:30.292 --> 00:55:36.694]  But of course they've been hitting at about 79,000, 80,000 pages of new rules and regulations each year.
[00:55:37.055 --> 00:55:40.536]  Draconian rules and regulations with no wiggle room.
[00:55:40.836 --> 00:55:46.298]  Without having to find you guilty of a crime, they can impose excessive fines.
[00:55:46.719 --> 00:55:49.560]  Violating every one of the articles of the Constitution.
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:55.464]  We said we had a revolution in this country because we wanted, did not want, taxation without representation.
[00:55:55.484 --> 00:55:59.347]  Well, I don't want legislation and taxation without representation.
[00:55:59.827 --> 00:56:05.752]  We have a swarm of officers who are harassing our people and eating out their substance.
[00:56:05.772 --> 00:56:06.553]  Does that sound familiar?
[00:56:07.173 --> 00:56:09.334]  That's the beginning of the Declaration of Independence.
[00:56:10.054 --> 00:56:11.375]  That's what we have to stop.
[00:56:11.855 --> 00:56:16.297]  So when we look at this fast track, we've been sold this as a deal.
[00:56:16.617 --> 00:56:18.418]  We've been told it's an agreement.
[00:56:19.099 --> 00:56:20.559]  It's a partnership.
[00:56:20.899 --> 00:56:21.200]  Remember?
[00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:24.241]  The NAFTA was a North American Free Trade Agreement.
[00:56:24.801 --> 00:56:29.664]  The TPP and the TTIP are transatlantic and transpacific partnerships.
[00:56:29.704 --> 00:56:32.465]  Whenever they talk about them, they love to talk about them being a deal.
[00:56:32.525 --> 00:56:33.125]  But guess what?
[00:56:33.605 --> 00:56:34.186]  They're treaties!
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:42.464]  A treaty is an agreement between two or more countries that is about economics or other issues.
[00:56:42.504 --> 00:56:45.706]  If you look it up in the dictionary, the very first thing they say is about economics.
[00:56:45.786 --> 00:56:47.507]  That's the very first definition they come up with.
[00:56:47.907 --> 00:57:02.415]  So it was interesting yesterday when I saw this article in the Drudge Report linking to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, CBC, and out of Canada they say Canada will sign the TPP trade deal February the 4th, but ratification is not certain.
[00:57:03.089 --> 00:57:04.753]  Now, this is the person...
[00:57:05.717 --> 00:57:12.621]  Who is the International Trade Representative for Canada, and she says, signing does not equal ratifying.
[00:57:12.701 --> 00:57:22.027]  Signing is simply a technical step in the process allowing the TPP text to be tabled in the Canadian Parliament for consideration for debate before any final decision is made.
[00:57:22.407 --> 00:57:32.314]  And they even say in the text of this CBC article, but when it comes to ratification of the 12-country treaty, the 12-country treaty, this is a treaty.
[00:57:32.514 --> 00:57:34.475]  How are treaties passed in the Constitution?
[00:57:34.815 --> 00:57:38.300]  You have to have two-thirds majority of the Senate to pass a treaty.
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:40.002]  They don't have that, so what do they do?
[00:57:40.851 --> 00:57:48.294]  They vote and they pass a law between the Senate and the Congress saying we're going to have a TPA, a Trade Promotion Authority.
[00:57:48.715 --> 00:57:54.477]  We are going to ignore the requirements for a treaty to be ratified under the Constitution.
[00:57:54.797 --> 00:58:04.582]  And what we're going to say is there's going to be no debate, there'll be no amendments, we will have 20 hours of discussion max, and then it's going to be a straight up and down simple majority vote.
[00:58:05.583 --> 00:58:09.626]  Of this document that was created by multinational corporations.
[00:58:10.207 --> 00:58:13.489]  That our elected representatives had nothing to do with writing.
[00:58:13.909 --> 00:58:22.696]  That our elected representatives were forbidden from telling the public about and they, with the exception of Senator Sessions, they all shut up and fell in line.
[00:58:23.817 --> 00:58:25.198]  That is disgusting.
[00:58:25.659 --> 00:58:27.180]  And you ought to be disgusted about that too.
[00:58:28.971 --> 00:58:35.058]  Well, thank you for watching the show tonight, and be sure and join us this Thursday evening, live, 7 p.m.

[00:58:39.703 --> 00:58:44.929]  Myself and the rest of the crew will be here breaking through the lies and propaganda in real time.
[00:58:45.089 --> 00:58:45.650]  We'll see you then.
[00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:49.961]  Knockout is back.

[00:59:04.011 --> 00:59:13.158]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:13.538 --> 00:59:15.320]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.761]  It's the same price.
[00:59:17.481 --> 00:59:23.364]  As leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece, it has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult.
[00:59:23.904 --> 00:59:30.148]  It's got the GABA, so it would probably cost $50 to take all this as separate pills.
[00:59:30.648 --> 00:59:30.768]  It's $19.95.
[00:59:31.488 --> 00:59:33.830]  You take one or two of these,
[00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:38.213]  And it just is really clean restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[00:59:38.553 --> 00:59:42.476]  It's what I've experienced and it just synergistically puts everything in there.
