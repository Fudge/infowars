[00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:21.746]  Welcome to NIFA Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.846 --> 00:00:22.447]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:22.487 --> 00:00:24.989]  It's Wednesday, December 14th, 2016.
[00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:26.450]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:34.537]  Tonight, the Federal Reserve has raised rates for the second time in a decade.
[00:00:34.997 --> 00:00:35.338]  Why?
[00:00:35.718 --> 00:00:37.520]  And what do rate hikes mean for us?
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.565]  Plus, women in France are now being shunned in some neighborhoods for not wearing a burka.
[00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.474]  Also, social justice warriors are doing all they can to stop the inaugural deplorable.
[00:00:50.874 --> 00:00:52.055]  Will they be successful?
[00:00:52.075 --> 00:00:52.475]  Streets!
[00:00:52.836 --> 00:00:53.356]  Our streets!
[00:00:53.396 --> 00:00:54.177]  Whose streets?
[00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:55.098]  Our streets!
[00:00:55.178 --> 00:00:55.938]  Whose streets?
[00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.819]  Our streets!
[00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:57.620]  Whose streets?
[00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.804]  Meanwhile, the liberalization of colleges have taken higher education to new lows.
[00:01:02.864 --> 00:01:06.207]  What if I told you that every single day kids go to school?
[00:01:07.228 --> 00:01:08.829]  They become less intelligent.
[00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:16.435]  And then, all eyes are on the Electoral College and some have decided to be faithless electors to keep Trump out of office.
[00:01:17.095 --> 00:01:20.458]  All that and more tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.610]  Today we had a reminder that the Federal Reserve is there to manipulate our economy.
[00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.852]  They have met and decided that they're going to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
[00:03:11.872 --> 00:03:21.074]  And we're going to take a look at the pattern of rate decreases and rate increases that have happened over the Federal Reserve and the subsequent consequences that have happened.
[00:03:21.114 --> 00:03:23.415]  But this is the way that it's reported by CNBC.
[00:03:23.835 --> 00:03:26.676]  They say Federal Reserve officials, amid signs that the U.S.
[00:03:26.716 --> 00:03:30.037]  economy could soon shed its long period of stagnation,
[00:03:30.797 --> 00:03:33.799]  Now, hold that phrase in your mind there for a second.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.463]  We have just seen NBC admit that we've had a long period of stagnation.
[00:03:39.563 --> 00:03:43.906]  I thought that we had recovered, according to them, during the Obama years.
[00:03:43.946 --> 00:03:45.127]  But now they say, no, no, no.
[00:03:46.048 --> 00:03:47.289]  We just have stagnation.
[00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.350]  We haven't really recovered in the economy.
[00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.772]  And now we're worried because people are optimistic that Donald Trump is there.
[00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:58.656]  But even more so, the establishment wants to make sure there is no Trump boom.
[00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:16.979]  They're looking at the stock market, they're seeing the optimism in the American economy, they're seeing talk of cutting regulations, cutting taxes, putting a cap on spending, which the other side of the Republican aisle is also saying, the other side of the Republican aisle from Donald Trump that is, the opposition to Donald, the Republican opposition to Trump, but there's signs
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.367]  And everybody believes that Trump is going to do things to make this economy work instead of trying to chain us down as Obama has done.
[00:04:24.407 --> 00:04:34.498]  So, they admit that there's stagnation, they're afraid of a Trump recovery, so they're going to move with interest rates and they say that they foresee three more interest rates increases next year.
[00:04:34.538 --> 00:04:35.118]  Think about that.
[00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.301]  Four increases in a year.
[00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:39.982]  We've seen this happen before.
[00:04:40.022 --> 00:04:43.125]  Now today it was only a quarter of a point that they went up.
[00:04:43.145 --> 00:04:44.206]  But we've seen this happen before.
[00:04:44.246 --> 00:04:47.208]  Take a look at this chart here from ValueWalk.
[00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:52.313]  They talk about the fact that the Fed is now about to begin an interest rate cycle of tightening.
[00:04:53.053 --> 00:04:54.955]  Look at this chart that's here.
[00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:58.438]  And of course you see the interest rate changes there as staircases.
[00:04:58.938 --> 00:05:02.000]  And if you look at that steep dip that started about 2001,
[00:05:04.045 --> 00:05:12.223]  That was Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve doing 13 consecutive decreases in interest rates, about five and a half points over two years.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.861]  It was a rope-a-dope, folks.
[00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:17.542]  That was what fueled the boom right there.
[00:05:17.562 --> 00:05:19.003]  And down at the bottom, what'd they do?
[00:05:19.083 --> 00:05:27.086]  Well, he started pulling the rug out of the economy then by doing 17 interest rate increases, all little steps.
[00:05:27.106 --> 00:05:28.467]  Look at those stair steps going up there.
[00:05:28.807 --> 00:05:29.628]  Ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom.
[00:05:29.668 --> 00:05:35.670]  Like every quarter, raising interest rates, raising interest rates, raising interest rates, until he got to the top and burst the bubble.
[00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:39.092]  They left it there for a while, and they started lowering interest rates.
[00:05:39.112 --> 00:05:40.993]  And now they've left them there for about a decade.
[00:05:41.897 --> 00:05:49.082]  This is the way the Federal Reserve creates boom and bust cycles, and they do it out of political motivation.
[00:05:49.122 --> 00:05:51.044]  They do it out of their own financial motivation.
[00:05:51.424 --> 00:05:55.107]  This was predicted by the opponents of the Federal Reserve when it came out.
[00:05:56.221 --> 00:06:08.831]  It was Lindbergh, Charles Lindbergh's father, who was a senator at the time, he said, they're going to create boom and bust cycles, they will know when this will happen, they will be able to profit from it themselves, and of course, they will be able to manipulate our country politically as well.
[00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:14.135]  They want to make sure that Donald Trump is not going to succeed, they're going to do what they can to make sure that doesn't happen.
[00:06:14.556 --> 00:06:18.679]  The other people that are coming out in opposition, besides the Federal Reserve of course, is China.
[00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:21.381]  Let's take a look at the things that have happened in China the last couple of days.
[00:06:21.421 --> 00:06:22.262]  I think it's very important
[00:06:22.862 --> 00:06:37.290]  We realize that as we see all this Russia phobia that is being hyped by both sides of the political establishment, that as we are attacking and getting aggressive with Russia, nobody is watching our back with China.
[00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.371]  And it is China that is attacking us.
[00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:42.072]  Donald Trump understands that.
[00:06:42.092 --> 00:06:43.933]  We're going to talk about the consequences of this.
[00:06:44.313 --> 00:06:47.315]  And we're going to, as we talk about these stories, I want you to consider the fact
[00:06:47.955 --> 00:07:00.959]  That all the things that the globalists cannot stand about Donald Trump, the fact that he's a nationalist, the fact that he wants to do well for his country, and then even accusing him of a protectionist, all of that is there with China.
[00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:09.302]  They are hyper-nationalists, they are hyper-protectionists, they are hegemonic, they're moving in the South China Sea too aggressively.
[00:07:09.322 --> 00:07:15.584]  We're going to take a look at all of this here, but first let's take a look at the fact that China moved, they said, to penalize US automakers, and the question is,
[00:07:16.164 --> 00:07:24.373]  Is this in response to Donald Trump's move in approaching Taiwan and saying, we're going to maybe consider this one China policy.
[00:07:24.453 --> 00:07:25.875]  That really infuriated them.
[00:07:25.895 --> 00:07:33.162]  They say Chinese officials warned that the Chinese government could slap a penalty on an unnamed US automaker for monopolistic behavior.
[00:07:34.163 --> 00:07:35.885]  Think about that, the absurdity of that.
[00:07:36.346 --> 00:07:47.396]  There is absolutely no way in the kind of protective environment that the Chinese government operates that a automaker, a foreign automaker, an American automaker could have a monopolistic behavior in China.
[00:07:48.177 --> 00:07:53.522]  You have to understand the China price has a lot of different elements to it and of course Donald Trump is aware of the China price.
[00:07:54.122 --> 00:07:54.503]  We're good to go.
[00:08:11.762 --> 00:08:17.091]  They do all kinds of things in China and they do not punish piracy as well.
[00:08:17.431 --> 00:08:19.875]  So there's a lot of different elements to the China price.
[00:08:19.895 --> 00:08:26.845]  We're not going to go into that now but he understands that and for the Chinese to accuse Ford and GM of monopolistic behavior is
[00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:29.948]  Bordering on the absurd, but that's the kind of rhetoric they come up with.
[00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:34.972]  They say this came days after Donald Trump talked about Taiwan.
[00:08:35.192 --> 00:08:37.053]  This is their shot across the bow, perhaps.
[00:08:37.354 --> 00:08:42.658]  They say Trump's rhetorical challenges to a long established policy towards China has rattled U.S.
[00:08:42.698 --> 00:08:43.318]  corporations.
[00:08:43.358 --> 00:08:44.939]  See, Trump is the bad guy.
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.322]  Not the hyper-nationalist, hyper-protectionist Chinese.
[00:08:48.382 --> 00:08:49.783]  It's Trump who's the bad guy.
[00:08:50.284 --> 00:08:54.427]  They say profits from Chinese operations for GM was about 20% of their corporate profits.
[00:08:54.507 --> 00:08:55.227]  It was about 16% for Ford.
[00:08:57.529 --> 00:09:00.330]  And look at the way China is moving militarily.
[00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.410]  Remember that they've gone into the South China Sea.
[00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.211]  It's not their sea anymore than the Gulf of Mexico belongs to Mexico.
[00:09:06.891 --> 00:09:12.653]  They border it, but they've set up these artificial islands very close to the Philippines, which concerns them.
[00:09:13.093 --> 00:09:16.774]  It's in waters that have always been considered to be international waters.
[00:09:17.194 --> 00:09:22.035]  But now China went in and did a very environmentally destructive thing in building
[00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:23.475]  We're good to go.
[00:09:52.429 --> 00:10:02.081]  This is despite statements by the Chinese leadership that Beijing has no intention to militarize the islands and the strategic trade route where territory is claimed by several countries.
[00:10:03.018 --> 00:10:18.693]  Now, as we move ahead and we look at this pic of Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State, and of course he still has to get confirmed, and it's amazing, as the Drudge Report pointed out, it was the Kremlin-ization, very close to criminalization, of Rex Tillerson.
[00:10:19.173 --> 00:10:25.699]  When you look at the monitors as we had in the studio, we had the sound off and I could see the monitors from the various stations up there.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.442]  CNN was running this endless loop
[00:10:29.102 --> 00:10:40.665]  Of military parades in Red Square, of the Kremlin, of the churches with the minarets and everything, and then showing pictures of Rex Tillerson shaking Putin's hand as if he's the only person that Rex Tillerson had ever met.
[00:10:41.245 --> 00:10:44.866]  The only friend in the world that he has is Vladimir Putin.
[00:10:44.906 --> 00:10:55.028]  Now, he's been around to a lot of different countries, but as they talk about this, the Chinese are worried about an easing of relationships between the US and Russia.
[00:10:55.788 --> 00:11:00.936]  Friends Forever asks The Guardian, China is wary of Rex Tillerson wooing away Russia.
[00:11:01.056 --> 00:11:01.737]  Think about this.
[00:11:02.518 --> 00:11:11.271]  The controversial nomination is fueling fears that the President-elect's courtship of the Kremlin could be part of a bold, strategic move to isolate China.
[00:11:12.216 --> 00:11:15.880]  They said, and think about this, this is the respect the Chinese have for him.
[00:11:16.321 --> 00:11:23.168]  He is a very adventurous strategist at a foreign policy specialist in Remnan University.
[00:11:23.989 --> 00:11:25.951]  This is the way the Chinese see him.
[00:11:26.171 --> 00:11:29.715]  They see him as moving very strategically.
[00:11:30.396 --> 00:11:34.317]  First to say that, hey, I've got Taiwan over here I can make moves towards.
[00:11:34.357 --> 00:11:37.218]  I've also got Russia over here that I can make moves to.
[00:11:37.678 --> 00:11:46.121]  And because Russia and China have been moving closer together based on the aggressive confrontational policies of Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[00:11:46.741 --> 00:11:51.426]  He goes on to say, if Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump become great friends, then China can do nothing about it.
[00:11:51.866 --> 00:11:56.311]  But China will be prepared for some degree of alienation between Moscow and Beijing.
[00:11:56.931 --> 00:12:09.604]  Growing Chinese angst that the Republicans might take a harder line on China and seek to drive a wedge between it and Russia was on display Wednesday in the editorial pages of the Global Times, which is a state-run newspaper.
[00:12:10.421 --> 00:12:14.027]  So they're concerned about the strategies that Donald Trump is doing.
[00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:21.079]  See how he is moving the positions already in terms of how he's going to bring them to the negotiating table.
[00:12:22.094 --> 00:12:29.916]  So China comes out and as reported by Reuters says, well we think that our relationship with America is too big to fail.
[00:12:29.936 --> 00:12:35.097]  I've heard that before and never does that work out good for the American consumer.
[00:12:35.137 --> 00:12:45.780]  When Donald Trump becomes US President next month they said, one issue above all others could force his new administration to work closely with China and underscore that Beijing and Washington need each other, that would be North Korea.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.761]  So what they're saying is that between China
[00:12:49.521 --> 00:12:55.946]  And the United States, they need to come together to try to control North Korea because it is a threat to both countries, quite frankly.
[00:12:56.646 --> 00:12:58.828]  A crazy, rogue dictator there.
[00:12:59.268 --> 00:13:07.134]  And they go on to say the Communist Party mouthpiece paper said the importance of the China-US relationship goes without saying that it is too big to fail.
[00:13:07.754 --> 00:13:08.935]  We'll see what happens.
[00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:15.799]  They say they were very happy when Trump first won because they thought, hey, we're going to take these guys for suckers.
[00:13:16.139 --> 00:13:21.803]  And they said they're not so happy now because they're starting to see the strategic moves that Donald Trump is making.
[00:13:22.779 --> 00:13:38.278]  Now I want to take a look at the other issues before us, too, as we look at the globalist issues, as we look at the fact that part of the globalist strategy is to replace cultures, to create an environment with not only open borders but with massive immigration
[00:13:39.099 --> 00:13:44.684]  To make sure that there is no effective resistance locally to their globalist moves.
[00:13:44.904 --> 00:13:48.868]  That everybody sees themselves simply as some place for a job.
[00:13:48.908 --> 00:13:52.291]  They have no loyalty to the country or the culture that they live in.
[00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:55.313]  So they're easily controlled by a globalist government.
[00:13:55.333 --> 00:13:57.876]  And of course that's what's behind the massive immigration.
[00:13:58.336 --> 00:13:59.858]  I want to take a look for a moment
[00:14:00.618 --> 00:14:04.280]  At the back and forth claims of tolerance and intolerance.
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:14.364]  This was brought to light by the German defense minister going to Saudi Arabia and refusing to wear a hijab during her meeting with one of the officials there.
[00:14:15.492 --> 00:14:17.873]  I guess the question is, to Burka or not to Burka?
[00:14:17.893 --> 00:14:18.693]  That is the question.
[00:14:18.973 --> 00:14:31.878]  This is Ursula von der Leyen and her team did not wear the traditional veil, which is worn by women, or the full-length Abaya garment, even though she has claimed to, quote-unquote, respect the country's customs.
[00:14:31.898 --> 00:14:33.179]  That was according to The Sun.
[00:14:33.219 --> 00:14:35.219]  They put that term, respect, in quotes.
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:41.562]  And I have to ask, why is, quote-unquote, respect flow only in one direction?
[00:14:42.202 --> 00:14:44.706]  Where is the respect for the individual to make their choices?
[00:14:45.106 --> 00:14:47.089]  Where is the respect for our culture?
[00:14:47.109 --> 00:14:48.951]  And we're going to see there is no respect for our culture.
[00:14:49.212 --> 00:14:51.795]  But first let's talk about the reaction in Saudi Arabia.
[00:14:52.476 --> 00:14:56.742]  It says her decision not to wear a hijab during her meeting with the Deputy Crown Prince
[00:14:57.574 --> 00:15:02.097]  Was not met warmly by the Saudis who took to Twitter to express their anger.
[00:15:02.877 --> 00:15:13.663]  Okay, so understand that the Saudi Crown Prince, Deputy Crown Prince, they've got a large bureaucracy there just in royalty, but they can go to Twitter and complain about it.
[00:15:13.743 --> 00:15:15.364]  They're not bad if they complain.
[00:15:15.945 --> 00:15:19.187]  It's only bad when Donald Trump goes to Twitter and says something.
[00:15:19.987 --> 00:15:20.487]  That's bad.
[00:15:21.028 --> 00:15:25.871]  But then they came out and said the German defense minister not wearing a hijab in Saudi Arabia was deliberate.
[00:15:25.911 --> 00:15:27.452]  This is an insult to Saudi Arabia.
[00:15:27.492 --> 00:15:28.693]  Well, she wasn't having any of it.
[00:15:28.733 --> 00:15:39.159]  She pushed right back and said, no woman in my delegation will be required to wear the abaya as the right to choose one's attire.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.561]  Is the right shared by men and women equally?
[00:15:44.201 --> 00:15:46.242]  Understand, we are not your slave.
[00:15:46.642 --> 00:15:49.523]  We're not going to be dictated to you as to how we're going to dress.
[00:15:49.563 --> 00:15:51.824]  And yet, that is precisely what is happening in France.
[00:15:52.644 --> 00:15:59.486]  So they demand that when the German people go to Saudi Arabia, that they dress as the Saudis demand.
[00:15:59.946 --> 00:16:05.608]  But when the Muslims come to France, then the French women have to adopt their customs.
[00:16:05.728 --> 00:16:06.488]  You see how this works?
[00:16:07.432 --> 00:16:10.795]  RT reports women are shunned in some Muslim neighborhoods in France.
[00:16:10.855 --> 00:16:13.538]  This is a report done by France 2 TV.
[00:16:13.938 --> 00:16:22.006]  An investigation, also with the aid of a group called BDM, says cafes are no-go for feminine sex.
[00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:25.810]  Streets full solely of men and women are veiled from head to toe.
[00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:30.474]  No, this is not a highly religious neighborhood in Saudi Arabia, but a suburb of Paris.
[00:16:31.195 --> 00:16:33.037]  With predominantly Muslim population.
[00:16:33.597 --> 00:16:40.863]  And this investigation, they went in with a hidden camera, and they went into one cafe, and listen to this dialogue that goes back and forth.
[00:16:41.444 --> 00:16:42.985]  All male customers in this cafe.
[00:16:43.005 --> 00:16:44.566]  A woman walks in.
[00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:47.029]  They were asked, are you looking for men?
[00:16:47.309 --> 00:16:48.730]  In other words, are you whores?
[00:16:49.511 --> 00:16:51.953]  They said, there are men in this cafe.
[00:16:52.413 --> 00:16:53.734]  And the women said, it's okay.
[00:16:54.335 --> 00:16:56.517]  In the world, there are men and women.
[00:16:57.486 --> 00:17:01.908]  And they said, the men in the cafe answered, no, this is Sevran, not Paris.
[00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:04.670]  We have a different mentality.
[00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.332]  They said, it's not like in France, it is like back home.
[00:17:09.753 --> 00:17:10.313]  Understand that?
[00:17:10.573 --> 00:17:12.674]  They do not see France as their home.
[00:17:13.034 --> 00:17:18.097]  They will not assimilate into France any more than our immigrants coming into this country want to be Americans.
[00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:19.878]  These people do not want to be French.
[00:17:20.438 --> 00:17:22.620]  They want France to be Muslim.
[00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:24.882]  It's not like our home.
[00:17:25.262 --> 00:17:27.703]  Or they said, this area is like our home.
[00:17:27.743 --> 00:17:28.804]  It's not like France.
[00:17:29.625 --> 00:17:33.087]  And then the woman replies, or the women reply, but it is France.
[00:17:33.727 --> 00:17:38.410]  Because this area is only nine and a half miles from the very center of Paris.
[00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:40.751]  That is what we see happening here.
[00:17:41.312 --> 00:17:46.935]  And as they pointed out, is that in other neighborhoods in France, women have become undesirable in public places.
[00:17:46.975 --> 00:17:51.758]  Walking in a skirt, having a coffee on the terrace, can become a real challenge for them.
[00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:55.846]  Meanwhile, look at the way the intolerance flows here in America.
[00:17:56.127 --> 00:17:57.650]  You think this is a European problem?
[00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:57.710]  No.
[00:17:58.854 --> 00:18:10.218]  We now have the University of Maryland and a Project UMD where students are protesting and demanding that they never have movies like American Sniper on campus again because it offends Muslims.
[00:18:10.578 --> 00:18:13.139]  And this was something that became national news back in the spring of 2015.
[00:18:13.179 --> 00:18:18.841]  The Student Entertainment Events scheduled American Sniper for screening in the Student Union.
[00:18:18.881 --> 00:18:21.762]  There were big responses back against that and now they have organized.
[00:18:22.102 --> 00:18:23.323]  And listen to these demands.
[00:18:23.683 --> 00:18:33.026]  They demand not only that they ban movies that they think offend Muslims, but they also demand that they have safe prayer rooms on campus.
[00:18:33.066 --> 00:18:42.849]  They want one prayer room in each building, and they demand shuttle services to the mosque, which is a half-hour drive away from the college.
[00:18:44.069 --> 00:18:45.690]  That's tolerance, isn't it?
[00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:46.050]  No.
[00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.751]  It is conquest of our country.
[00:18:48.771 --> 00:18:49.231]  Stay with us.
[00:18:49.571 --> 00:18:52.072]  We'll be right back, and we're going to talk about the Electoral College.
[00:19:01.977 --> 00:19:16.387]  Three years ago, the Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act repealed the law that had been on the books for decades, barring the CIA and other agencies from engaging in domestic propaganda and disinformation.
[00:19:17.734 --> 00:19:36.358]  Over the weekend, they passed the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act that funds 160 plus million dollars to this new organization that will, quote, discover and counter with its own disinformation, alternative media that they dub fake news.
[00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:52.010]  At the very same time, we see mainstream media claiming that Trump, myself, Tucker Carlson, you name it, are Russian agents, and that the American people really wanted Hillary Clinton, but the Russians somehow hacked in, and that's why Trump won.
[00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:56.173]  Yes, we've gotten Trump elected, but they're openly trying to overthrow that.
[00:19:57.034 --> 00:20:00.379]  Now more than ever, InfoWars needs your prayers and your support.
[00:20:00.439 --> 00:20:06.106]  And I need you to take the articles and the videos that are on the site and realize you're the reason we're having such an effect.
[00:20:06.166 --> 00:20:07.948]  You're the power of InfoWars.
[00:20:08.329 --> 00:20:12.574]  Get those articles, get those videos, get those special reports out to everyone you know.
[00:20:13.869 --> 00:20:22.471]  As we approach Christmas, and I'm supposed to say that word now, our country's under such incredible thought police tyranny, it's important to be thankful.
[00:20:22.612 --> 00:20:34.215]  And I am extremely thankful to all of you that have prayed for us, that have spread the word about the broadcast, that have supported us, that have defended us, and that have financially supported us.

[00:21:20.994 --> 00:21:21.995]  1995 can't beat that deal.

[00:22:01.354 --> 00:22:03.054]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.

[00:22:17.057 --> 00:22:21.858]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:22:22.018 --> 00:22:27.499]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.

[00:22:46.202 --> 00:22:49.163]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.

[00:23:02.807 --> 00:23:08.909]  We're going to take a look at the Electoral College, specifically at this movement to subvert Trump's election.
[00:23:08.929 --> 00:23:15.931]  I think a lot of these electors, when they signed up for this, I think they thought they were going to go to a party where they could wear their Uncle Sam costume.
[00:23:16.471 --> 00:23:24.314]  And now some of them have been caught up in political intrigue and illusions of grandeur, imagining that they are Mr. Smith going to Washington.
[00:23:24.354 --> 00:23:27.275]  And I'm talking about you specifically, Chris Supron.
[00:23:28.035 --> 00:23:31.976]  I asked you for an interview days ago on Twitter.
[00:23:32.116 --> 00:23:37.597]  I also contacted your media representative at Media Megaphone Strategies.
[00:23:37.757 --> 00:23:38.538]  What a joke!
[00:23:38.858 --> 00:23:39.998]  You don't have a megaphone.
[00:23:40.338 --> 00:23:51.161]  You've got a strategy of hit and run in the press and now you're hiding because you don't want to talk to somebody that would question your fundamental assumptions about the Electoral College and your motivations and also
[00:23:51.761 --> 00:23:53.302]  The so-called Hamilton elections.
[00:23:53.322 --> 00:23:55.924]  We're going to take a look at how these electors are selected.
[00:23:56.284 --> 00:24:01.408]  We're going to look at why this is a criminal conspiracy and some of these people could wind up going to jail.
[00:24:01.808 --> 00:24:11.655]  We're going to look at what the original Federalist Papers actually say and we're going to look at what we really should do to change this to keep this kind of thing from happening again.
[00:24:12.056 --> 00:24:20.061]  Understand the people that are behind this are simply leftist progressives who are now appealing to the Federalist Papers and Alexander Hamilton
[00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:22.551]  Because why?
[00:24:22.571 --> 00:24:24.192]  It suits their agenda.
[00:24:24.232 --> 00:24:37.380]  These are people who have always hated the written Constitution, who have always thumbed their noses at looking at the original documents to try to find out original intent, and we're going to look at the original text that they're trying to appeal to.
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.241]  This came out about a week ago, about a week and a day ago.
[00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:51.104]  Christopher Supran, who is a New Yorker who moved to Texas, and now he believes that he knows better than the 4.7 million Texans who voted for Donald Trump.
[00:24:51.144 --> 00:24:53.664]  And he's going to overrule their votes.
[00:24:53.744 --> 00:24:56.385]  And we're going to ask, who gave him this authority?
[00:24:56.445 --> 00:24:57.765]  How did he become an elector?
[00:24:58.166 --> 00:25:02.907]  He wrote in the New York Times, why I will not cast my electoral vote for Donald Trump.
[00:25:03.467 --> 00:25:06.610]  And listen to some of the horrible things that he thinks that Mr. Trump has done.
[00:25:06.811 --> 00:25:12.797]  Mr. Trump, he said, has gone out of his way to attack the cast of Saturday Night Live for bias.
[00:25:12.817 --> 00:25:14.258]  He did that on Twitter, of all things.
[00:25:14.659 --> 00:25:16.641]  This, he says, is unacceptable.
[00:25:17.281 --> 00:25:17.722]  The U.S.
[00:25:17.762 --> 00:25:21.386]  was set up as a republic and Alexander Hamilton provided a blueprint
[00:25:21.806 --> 00:25:22.887]  For the state's votes.
[00:25:23.387 --> 00:25:23.647]  Okay.
[00:25:23.967 --> 00:25:29.610]  So, amongst the other crimes, he has attacked the Saturday Night Live cast for their attacks of him.
[00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:29.970]  You know what?
[00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.791]  I don't really care whether he likes Donald Trump or not.
[00:25:33.172 --> 00:25:37.214]  The fundamental issue is that he doesn't have the authority to override our votes.
[00:25:37.634 --> 00:25:39.415]  But of course, this is a massive movement.
[00:25:39.475 --> 00:25:43.997]  He is simply a figurehead, a puppet, a pawn who could wind up going to jail if he goes through with this.
[00:25:44.377 --> 00:25:47.919]  Meanwhile, you've got Lawrence Lessig from Harvard, a very liberal professor.
[00:25:48.539 --> 00:25:49.000]  We're good to go.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.940]  A criminal conspiracy.
[00:26:07.981 --> 00:26:14.823]  He says we are going to set up a platform here with this Electors Trust where electors can strategize about how they can stop Trump.
[00:26:15.284 --> 00:26:20.266]  Understand, they're not trying to stop Trump, they're trying to stop our electoral process.
[00:26:20.706 --> 00:26:20.966]  Okay?
[00:26:21.266 --> 00:26:22.427]  You have to take this personally.
[00:26:22.447 --> 00:26:24.688]  You have to understand, this isn't about one man.
[00:26:25.168 --> 00:26:27.289]  This is about a cabal of people.
[00:26:28.189 --> 00:26:34.813]  Getting involved in intrigue so that they can overthrow an election that you voted in, that you did not vote for any of these people.
[00:26:34.853 --> 00:26:38.716]  And then we've got a Democrat congressman saying the electors should consider foreign influence.
[00:26:38.736 --> 00:26:43.379]  They should get phony briefings from the CIA telling them about casting these votes.
[00:26:43.499 --> 00:26:45.740]  And then they've got the Hamilton electors website.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.340]  Take a look at this.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.522]  Together we can stop Trump.
[00:26:49.142 --> 00:26:50.964]  They call themselves Hamilton electors.
[00:26:51.044 --> 00:26:52.426]  We call them faithless electors.
[00:26:52.466 --> 00:26:56.290]  Maybe we should call them faithless Federalists, okay?
[00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.311]  Because that's really what they are.
[00:26:57.351 --> 00:26:58.493]  Maybe coup creeps.
[00:26:58.873 --> 00:26:59.814]  That'd be enough.
[00:26:59.834 --> 00:27:03.098]  But let's take a look at four issues here.
[00:27:03.558 --> 00:27:05.380]  If we go back and look at the Federalist Papers.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.884]  If they want to appeal to Alexander Hamilton, let's go back and look at Alexander Hamilton.
[00:27:09.625 --> 00:27:10.166]  Number one.
[00:27:11.175 --> 00:27:15.457]  These electors were to be chosen by the people in each state.
[00:27:15.757 --> 00:27:18.278]  This is what he had to say if we look at the various phrases here.
[00:27:18.798 --> 00:27:33.204]  To men, we're going to turn this over, chosen by the people for this special purpose, selected by their fellow citizens from the general mass, electors that are chosen in each state, these are all phrases from this document, Federalist No.
[00:27:33.224 --> 00:27:37.966]  1, the people of each state shall choose a number of persons as electors.
[00:27:38.026 --> 00:27:38.867]  And so I have to ask Chris,
[00:27:39.967 --> 00:27:40.948]  I'm in Texas.
[00:27:41.188 --> 00:27:43.449]  I didn't see your name on the ballot.
[00:27:43.509 --> 00:27:46.311]  I didn't see any of the electors' names on the ballot.
[00:27:46.811 --> 00:27:48.132]  I don't know who you are.
[00:27:48.752 --> 00:27:50.674]  You are an unelected elector.
[00:27:52.135 --> 00:27:53.055]  I did not choose you.
[00:27:53.155 --> 00:27:54.356]  None of the voters chose you.
[00:27:54.376 --> 00:27:56.497]  You were not even a choice that we had there.
[00:27:56.517 --> 00:27:57.258]  Okay?
[00:27:57.298 --> 00:27:58.558]  But you think that you know better.
[00:27:58.799 --> 00:28:05.002]  There were 800,000 more Texans that voted for Donald Trump than for Hillary, but you're going to override that.
[00:28:05.022 --> 00:28:05.683]  You know what this is?
[00:28:06.003 --> 00:28:08.845]  You're trying to create an election without representation.
[00:28:09.525 --> 00:28:11.427]  We didn't see you on the ballot, because you know what?
[00:28:11.487 --> 00:28:14.409]  If we had seen you on the ballot, we might have looked at your qualifications.
[00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:23.516]  Number two, we notice if we look at these documents, that these people were not chosen by the people in each state randomly, but according to qualifications.
[00:28:23.576 --> 00:28:29.000]  He wanted men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to their station.
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:32.783]  In other words, he wanted people who were going to be able to analyze these presidential candidates.
[00:28:33.703 --> 00:28:34.003]  Okay?
[00:28:34.103 --> 00:28:36.066]  And yet, we don't know who you are.
[00:28:36.826 --> 00:28:41.852]  We know your name now because it's been out there in public and we do know some things about you.
[00:28:41.892 --> 00:28:45.536]  Perhaps if you had been running on the ballot, we might have looked at your background.
[00:28:45.576 --> 00:28:47.377]  We might have realized, as it's been reported,
[00:28:48.399 --> 00:28:53.744]  That you use your 9-11 charity as an address to sign up for Ashley Madison.
[00:28:54.364 --> 00:29:03.112]  Got News did an investigation and they found that Chris Supran signed up for his Ashley Madison account while he was married with three kids under 10.
[00:29:04.193 --> 00:29:08.556]  And he paid $249 for a guaranteed affair the same month that he filed for bankruptcy.
[00:29:08.576 --> 00:29:13.919]  Because see, bankruptcy records are public and now the Ashley Madison records are public and you can see that documentation there.
[00:29:13.939 --> 00:29:19.222]  So Chris, we might not have signed up for you to be our representative if we'd known that about you.
[00:29:19.623 --> 00:29:27.808]  Number three, the purpose of the Electoral College, said Alexander Hamilton, you Hamilton electors, was to, quote, avoid tumult and disorder.
[00:29:28.368 --> 00:29:32.050]  To create an obstacle to cabal, intrigue, and corruption.
[00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:32.611]  He said this.
[00:29:33.291 --> 00:29:36.433]  We would afford as little opportunity as possible to tumult and disorder.
[00:29:36.794 --> 00:29:43.699]  Nothing was to be more desired than that every practical obstacle should be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and corruption.
[00:29:43.739 --> 00:29:52.526]  But the whole purpose of the Hamilton electors is to create tumult in our elections, disorder in our elections, and intrigue.
[00:29:52.926 --> 00:29:53.647]  That's what they're doing.
[00:29:54.699 --> 00:30:02.105]  And also to avoid these kind of cabals and intrigue, these people were to be independent of political bodies.
[00:30:02.405 --> 00:30:03.566]  That was his key thing.
[00:30:03.886 --> 00:30:12.933]  He did not want, and it is prohibited in the Constitution, that any elected officials or people who have government offices should not be a part of the Electoral College.
[00:30:13.533 --> 00:30:18.157]  It says, no senator, representative, or other person holding a place of trust or profit on the U.S.
[00:30:18.478 --> 00:30:20.419]  can be of the numbers of the electors.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:29.168]  Thus, without corrupting the body of the people, the immediate agents in the election will at least enter upon the task free from any sinister bias.
[00:30:29.688 --> 00:30:35.212]  What do you think is the bias when all of these electors are selected by the political parties?
[00:30:35.673 --> 00:30:43.639]  He said the end will be answered by committing the right of making it not to any pre-established body but to men chosen by the people for this special purpose.
[00:30:43.979 --> 00:30:50.043]  So you see what we have is political parties, which the founders would have called cabals, running the Electoral College.
[00:30:50.063 --> 00:30:53.326]  We've got Nancy Pelosi's daughter heading part of this revolt.
[00:30:53.586 --> 00:30:58.389]  So now I want to talk to you in the time we've got left of why these Hamilton electors may go to jail.
[00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:11.923]  This is some legal advice from Law News and he points out that Texas law allows electors to declare an intended faithless elector ineligible and replace him at the elector meeting in Texas.
[00:31:11.943 --> 00:31:20.952]  This will help the voters and it will also help these faithless electors to keep them from being accused of serious crimes like election fraud or perjury.
[00:31:20.972 --> 00:31:21.993]  You see Chris,
[00:31:22.814 --> 00:31:29.380]  Suprin, you are a useful idiot who is about to get charged with some very serious crimes if you go through with this.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:34.624]  And he points out that both history and the law prove the media story is fake news.
[00:31:34.804 --> 00:31:47.995]  In 1952, a Supreme Court decision, the Wray decision, made it clear that the state can give state parties control over their electors and many state parties require electors, as they do here in Texas, to sign affidavits to vote for the nominee.
[00:31:48.155 --> 00:31:49.377]  There's your perjury right there.
[00:31:50.057 --> 00:31:50.277]  Thank you.
[00:32:08.883 --> 00:32:23.796]  Who went to the Republicans, said, I will vote for the person that is selected by the people, and now he is saying, I know I signed that paper, and I lied to you, I'm going to do whatever I wish, and I'm going to encourage other people to do the same thing.
[00:32:24.357 --> 00:32:25.638]  It is an outright revolt.
[00:32:26.339 --> 00:32:30.963]  Now, Reason Magazine put it this way, they said, all the people complaining about the fact that we've got a popular vote,
[00:32:32.202 --> 00:32:33.763]  And we need to do this differently.
[00:32:33.783 --> 00:32:35.064]  So think about the World Series.
[00:32:35.585 --> 00:32:39.948]  It's not who got the most number of runs, it's who won each individual game.
[00:32:40.368 --> 00:32:44.911]  We had 51 different elections and that's the way we break it down state by state.
[00:32:44.931 --> 00:32:45.992]  There's a good reason for that.
[00:32:46.552 --> 00:32:54.518]  And what we need to do is we need to keep the Electoral College to preserve the states, but we need to get rid of the political intrigue, the actual individuals.
[00:32:54.558 --> 00:32:55.639]  Just report the vote totals.
[00:33:02.486 --> 00:33:07.267]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[00:33:07.407 --> 00:33:14.469]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[00:33:14.729 --> 00:33:23.212]  I started to exercise really hard again, and I started to try to eat healthy, started taking third-party supplements, started seeing some more gains.
[00:33:23.732 --> 00:33:27.553]  But when I started working with Dr. Group and some of the other top formulators in the country,
[00:33:27.913 --> 00:33:34.038]  They said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that the population is absolutely deficient in.
[00:33:34.278 --> 00:33:34.619]  Boom!
[00:33:34.959 --> 00:33:36.400]  Weight started pouring off.
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.402]  Toxins started coming out of my body.
[00:33:38.882 --> 00:33:45.307]  Then, by early 2016, I was in the best shape of my life since I'd been in really good shape in my 20s.
[00:33:45.448 --> 00:33:46.528]  But the election heated up.
[00:33:46.588 --> 00:33:48.950]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[00:33:49.071 --> 00:33:51.953]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we
[00:33:52.253 --> 00:33:52.513]  I think.
[00:34:12.415 --> 00:34:15.257]  If the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[00:34:15.457 --> 00:34:16.377]  It's December 5th, 2016.
[00:34:16.517 --> 00:34:20.339]  We're only like 25 days from 2017.
[00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:30.645]  And I want to invite all of the Info Warriors of every race, color, and creed that bleed red blood and love liberty, justice, and truth to make our bodies great again.
[00:34:33.564 --> 00:34:38.547]  One of the most common questions I get is, you've changed the whole radio TV model.
[00:34:39.347 --> 00:34:40.087]  How did you do it?
[00:34:40.127 --> 00:34:41.708]  Did an ad agency teach you that?
[00:34:41.728 --> 00:34:43.029]  Or what book did you read?
[00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:44.910]  And the answer is, it was trial and error.
[00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:50.472]  I promote products that I personally use, like the Nutraceuticals and Infowarslife.com.
[00:34:50.953 --> 00:34:52.774]  And it's the same thing for this promotion.
[00:34:53.254 --> 00:34:54.595]  I didn't get this from an ad agency.
[00:34:54.655 --> 00:34:55.855]  I didn't just think this up.
[00:34:56.335 --> 00:34:58.436]  I was sitting there, I'd gained probably 10-15 pounds.
[00:34:59.657 --> 00:35:03.199]  Because I've gotten out of the habit of taking the supplements in the last few months with the election.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.122]  And I was thinking, wow, I need to religiously take these.
[00:35:07.662 --> 00:35:08.903]  Because I'm promoting these things.
[00:35:08.963 --> 00:35:09.823]  It's making me healthier.
[00:35:10.083 --> 00:35:12.545]  And if I'm not taking them, you know, I'm fatter.
[00:35:12.785 --> 00:35:14.026]  Plus, people aren't going to buy the product.
[00:35:14.526 --> 00:35:15.967]  So that's where the promotion comes from.
[00:35:16.267 --> 00:35:17.628]  It's purely from reality.
[00:35:18.004 --> 00:35:19.845]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[00:35:20.245 --> 00:35:24.827]  I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[00:35:25.167 --> 00:35:31.649]  I've lost five pounds, religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[00:35:32.029 --> 00:35:32.569]  It's amazing.
[00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:35.230]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[00:35:35.511 --> 00:35:38.212]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:35:38.412 --> 00:35:40.993]  And to be clear, I'm exercising the same amount.
[00:35:41.673 --> 00:35:45.574]  It's the holidays, so I'm eating pumpkin pie, pecan pie.
[00:35:45.594 --> 00:35:46.995]  I ate a candy bar last night.
[00:35:48.439 --> 00:35:51.581]  I mean, quite frankly, I eat more junk during the holidays like everybody else.
[00:35:52.021 --> 00:35:53.282]  So I'm eating worse.
[00:35:53.902 --> 00:36:01.286]  But because I've got these trace elements, or whatever it's doing in DNA Force and X2 and Supermail, I have lost 5 pounds.
[00:36:01.426 --> 00:36:01.967]  It's incredible.
[00:36:02.967 --> 00:36:04.908]  I thought I might lose 10 to 15 in a month.
[00:36:05.129 --> 00:36:06.409]  If this continues, it'll be 20.
[00:36:06.509 --> 00:36:08.931]  But generally, it's more dramatic up front.
[00:36:09.531 --> 00:36:10.412]  This is an experiment.
[00:36:10.512 --> 00:36:11.272]  Everybody's watching.
[00:36:11.512 --> 00:36:12.353]  We'll see what happens.
[00:36:12.793 --> 00:36:13.633]  This is Part 2.
[00:36:14.744 --> 00:36:15.685]  Next week, part three.
[00:36:16.445 --> 00:36:17.065]  That's a good point.
[00:36:17.866 --> 00:36:26.990]  We just cut there and Rob Deuce said, hey Alex, I know you don't follow script, but you might want to add to people, we're running some of the biggest specials of the year until December 17th.
[00:36:27.271 --> 00:36:32.994]  That's the last day that you can get your order in and have guaranteed shipping anywhere in the United States.
[00:36:33.194 --> 00:36:34.935]  And we have some of the biggest specials of the year.
[00:36:35.795 --> 00:36:38.837]  50% off many of the nutraceuticals, the lowest discounts 25%, 30% off X2,
[00:36:41.898 --> 00:36:46.042]  Huge discounts and free shipping storewide on every product.
[00:36:46.102 --> 00:36:46.983]  Thousands of items.
[00:36:47.423 --> 00:36:51.787]  And on top of that, if you sign up for auto-ship, an additional 10% off.
[00:36:51.827 --> 00:36:55.170]  And I'm going to do one more bad thing because I'm politically correct.
[00:36:55.691 --> 00:36:56.792]  Or I guess I'm politically incorrect.
[00:36:57.232 --> 00:36:59.274]  And that's to say Merry Christmas to everybody.
[00:36:59.594 --> 00:37:00.775]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:37:00.835 --> 00:37:01.416]  You're awesome.
[00:37:04.366 --> 00:37:07.069]  More disinformation coming out of the New York Times.
[00:37:07.149 --> 00:37:08.710]  I'm joined in studio by Owen Schwerer.
[00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:10.632]  We're going to be breaking down some articles for you.
[00:37:11.092 --> 00:37:14.055]  Two in particular that have really annoyed me over the past couple of days.
[00:37:14.556 --> 00:37:20.561]  Number one, New York Times airs ad for fake news story by mistake in an article decrying fake news.
[00:37:20.681 --> 00:37:26.787]  Of course, they're calling us fake news along with Breitbart, Drudge, and they're trying to, you know, censor and ban whatever they can.
[00:37:26.807 --> 00:37:27.828]  They're calling for Facebook
[00:37:28.228 --> 00:37:38.337]  They actually said shame on you, Mark Zuckerberg, for allowing this dangerous information on your platform, and yet they're airing fake ads in the middle of calling us fake news.
[00:37:38.698 --> 00:37:40.599]  Well, and I know that you really wanted to come out here.
[00:37:40.639 --> 00:37:42.761]  You've been offended by the New York Times.
[00:37:42.781 --> 00:37:44.643]  You're very credible as a reporter.
[00:37:44.703 --> 00:37:45.044]  Thank you.
[00:37:45.204 --> 00:37:51.109]  And I don't mean to take you off of your soapbox here, but you know, it's kind of like the same thing when they say, you know, you're a racist.
[00:37:51.149 --> 00:37:53.671]  Like, you know, I get called a racist when I go cover these Trump things.
[00:37:54.452 --> 00:37:59.834]  Well, I shouldn't have to sit here and waste my time explaining how I'm not a racist.
[00:37:59.874 --> 00:38:04.656]  I shouldn't have to enter a conversation with somebody explaining how I'm not a racist.
[00:38:04.676 --> 00:38:05.496]  That's just how it works.
[00:38:05.516 --> 00:38:07.257]  Wait a second, you're not a racist, right?
[00:38:07.317 --> 00:38:07.557]  Right.
[00:38:07.597 --> 00:38:09.098]  So, okay, here's how I'm not a racist.
[00:38:09.138 --> 00:38:11.179]  No, but it's the same thing now with this news.
[00:38:11.239 --> 00:38:11.559]  It's like...
[00:38:12.319 --> 00:38:18.986]  I have to explain how I'm not fake news, or you have to explain how you're not fake news, despite your credentials, despite everything.
[00:38:20.188 --> 00:38:23.011]  You have to talk about how you're not fake news before you even cover news.
[00:38:23.291 --> 00:38:28.517]  It's the same ad hominem identity attack without any basis at all.
[00:38:28.677 --> 00:38:30.478]  Well, when did they ever have to have a base, Owen?
[00:38:31.018 --> 00:38:34.260]  The title of their article was, The Death of Facts, basically.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.681]  That's the New York Times.
[00:38:35.701 --> 00:38:41.944]  And they began to spin their facts accordingly, insinuating that Russian hackers acted to aid Trump in the election.
[00:38:42.025 --> 00:38:44.346]  So, those are some pretty made-up facts right there.
[00:38:44.366 --> 00:38:47.728]  And I just want to take you to a little part of this, because it's particularly funny.
[00:38:47.748 --> 00:38:49.829]  It's comedic, actually.
[00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:55.197]  In the months before the election, it was largely documented that the Democratic Party systems were leaked to the public.
[00:38:55.638 --> 00:38:59.885]  Intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russians gave the Democrats documents to WikiLeaks.
[00:39:00.899 --> 00:39:02.100]  Well and on what planet?
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.323]  And there's Julian Assange has said that that's not true.
[00:39:05.543 --> 00:39:05.784]  Right.
[00:39:06.024 --> 00:39:09.527]  People have said that they know who the leaker or hacker was.
[00:39:09.827 --> 00:39:13.891]  You know really this if it's somebody within the party it's not even technically a hack.
[00:39:14.452 --> 00:39:16.354]  Especially if they already had access to these emails.
[00:39:16.394 --> 00:39:17.395]  I mean who really knows.
[00:39:17.575 --> 00:39:18.636]  They just leaked it right.
[00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:23.580]  But you know this is all this is all semantics that we can sit here and they want to have us talking about these semantics.
[00:39:24.341 --> 00:39:26.604]  And Obama will say quit obsessing over the content.
[00:39:27.024 --> 00:39:29.187]  No, how about we do obsess over the content?
[00:39:29.227 --> 00:39:30.548]  How about we look at the content?
[00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:38.938]  Why are you trying to divert from the content and make up fake news about who actually did the hack or did the leak without any evidence at all?
[00:39:39.278 --> 00:39:42.180]  Right, they think that the messenger should be shot, basically.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.542]  And they're trying to implicate the Russians on every level here.
[00:39:46.562 --> 00:39:47.983]  They hacked into our election.
[00:39:48.023 --> 00:39:49.163]  They aided Donald Trump.
[00:39:49.224 --> 00:39:50.804]  They hacked into the DNC email.
[00:39:50.824 --> 00:39:53.206]  You know, it's so comical.
[00:39:53.886 --> 00:40:00.790]  And as somebody who, you know, has had some experience working in Russia, living in, you know, this is particularly laughable.
[00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:01.871]  Better watch out here.
[00:40:02.971 --> 00:40:11.017]  I'm just saying, you know, it's particularly laughable to me if you have any sort of, you know, understanding of what's going on.
[00:40:11.077 --> 00:40:12.018]  It's hilarious.
[00:40:12.038 --> 00:40:16.401]  And the fact that they're... And not only that, but these are the media elites in our country.
[00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:18.282]  They're the gatekeepers.
[00:40:18.382 --> 00:40:22.465]  And they're just angry because fake news, as they're calling us, has unseated them.
[00:40:23.065 --> 00:40:29.550]  And they're going after people like our boss, Alex Jones, like Tucker Carlson, calling them both Russian agents, which is preposterous.
[00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:48.497]  Well you take pride in your work and that's why sometimes when we shoot these segments and you know I'm not exaggerating Margaret will come up to me steaming she'll be like Owen we have to talk about the New York Times you see what they were saying about us and I'm like okay calm down we know that they're the actual fake news but you know but you take this stuff personally and it's but it's you know
[00:40:48.997 --> 00:40:53.280]  It's the kind of thing where now they're saying everybody's Russian, it's the Russian influence, right?
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.541]  Well, hold on a second though.
[00:40:54.561 --> 00:40:55.082]  Alright, fine.
[00:40:55.102 --> 00:40:55.362]  You know what?
[00:40:55.382 --> 00:40:56.683]  I'll go down that road with you.
[00:40:56.723 --> 00:40:59.064]  Let's say that Russia influenced these elections.
[00:40:59.105 --> 00:41:00.345]  Okay, so you have to say how?
[00:41:00.686 --> 00:41:03.508]  Well, you know, they got the WikiLeaks out there.
[00:41:03.528 --> 00:41:06.130]  They were the ones that exposed the corruption in the DNC.
[00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:06.830]  So wait a second.
[00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:13.795]  So then Russia influenced our election by exposing corruption inside our own Democratic Party here in America.
[00:41:14.276 --> 00:41:15.757]  But aren't these the same people?
[00:41:16.577 --> 00:41:18.439]  That want world influence?
[00:41:18.519 --> 00:41:21.342]  Aren't these the same people that are saying that American influence is bad?
[00:41:21.602 --> 00:41:22.963]  American influence needs to stop?
[00:41:23.404 --> 00:41:24.565]  That's what I'm sick of here.
[00:41:24.585 --> 00:41:29.730]  I don't care if the New York Crimes wants to attack me personally or call me fake news.
[00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:30.631]  I couldn't care less.
[00:41:30.971 --> 00:41:37.758]  But when they're blatant hypocrites, when they have blatant double standards and the general public buys into that, that's where I have the issue.
[00:41:38.158 --> 00:41:38.859]  They want this!
[00:41:38.919 --> 00:41:42.282]  They want to hoodwink everybody listening to them, everybody reading them.
[00:41:42.862 --> 00:41:47.366]  And Millie Weaver, she did this report, we're running out of time, but she was asking people, do you think the Russians hacked us?
[00:41:47.887 --> 00:41:50.269]  Unequivocally, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:41:50.549 --> 00:41:51.690]  So nobody's buying it.
[00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:54.753]  Even doing a man on the street, nobody is buying this stuff.
[00:41:55.073 --> 00:42:00.458]  And it's laughable, they're going down the tubes, and meanwhile they're saying that the death of facts is on us.
[00:42:01.039 --> 00:42:02.200]  No guys, it's on you.
[00:42:08.373 --> 00:42:11.575]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, where do Trump supporters go from here?
[00:42:11.615 --> 00:42:13.676]  We've had such a great time at all the rallies.
[00:42:13.716 --> 00:42:16.898]  We've had such a great time winning and winning and winning.
[00:42:17.498 --> 00:42:22.921]  But what kind of special event can a Trump supporter attend with other like-minded people
[00:42:23.721 --> 00:42:25.122]  As sort of a celebration.
[00:42:25.182 --> 00:42:27.605]  Well now, we have the Deplorable!
[00:42:27.665 --> 00:42:28.305]  That's right!
[00:42:28.966 --> 00:42:34.190]  The 2017 inaugural Deplorable is set to launch this year.
[00:42:34.551 --> 00:42:42.738]  But, of course, it wouldn't be a Deplorable if we didn't have to deal with some butt-hurt leftists in the process.
[00:42:42.818 --> 00:42:48.423]  The Trump inauguration event has to relocate after the leftists were complaining militant
[00:42:48.903 --> 00:42:52.108]  Social Justice Warriors attempt to shut down sold-out Deplorable.
[00:42:52.508 --> 00:42:55.753]  Organizers of the 2017 Deplorable in Washington D.C.
[00:42:55.793 --> 00:43:01.802]  were forced to move the sold-out event to a larger venue after the original venue gave in to Social Justice Warriors.
[00:43:01.842 --> 00:43:02.843]  Well, isn't that just great?
[00:43:03.766 --> 00:43:07.008]  Thank you so much, Social Justice Warriors!
[00:43:07.928 --> 00:43:17.453]  Now, instead of just having one room, room enough for one arm to drink champagne, maybe now I'll have room for one arm to drink champagne and the other arm to hold my cigar!
[00:43:17.914 --> 00:43:27.479]  Thank you so much, Social Justice Warriors, for having this event moved after the leftists began to direct their signature brand of oppressive outrage at
[00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:41.290]  Clarendon, which was where the original Deplora Ball was set to be held, the business shifted into damage control, tweeting directly to media outlets in denial of any events contracted for January 19th.
[00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:43.332]  Of course, that's when the Deplora Ball was supposed to happen.
[00:43:43.352 --> 00:43:45.194]  Now, this was countered
[00:43:46.351 --> 00:44:01.144]  By Mike Cernovich, who tweeted out the proposal that he has in the paperwork from the ballroom that was originally supposed to hold the Deplore Ball, and now they are not honoring that proposal.
[00:44:01.604 --> 00:44:03.266]  So, what are we going to do?
[00:44:03.786 --> 00:44:06.989]  Well, it looks like we're going to have to move, but here's what Cernovich said.
[00:44:07.509 --> 00:44:10.450]  Some still wonder why Trump won, and now you have the answer.
[00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:21.613]  We can't even have a party open to everyone, including liberals, gays, blacks, Latinos, whites, women, men, trans, and everyone else, without having Hillary supporters harass the venue owner to shut us down.
[00:44:21.993 --> 00:44:25.314]  Well, you know, maybe they're Hillary supporters, maybe they're not, maybe they're Bernie supporters.
[00:44:25.334 --> 00:44:26.234]  We know who they are, though.
[00:44:26.254 --> 00:44:28.455]  They're the leftist social justice warriors.
[00:44:28.875 --> 00:44:29.775]  And, you know, that's the thing.
[00:44:30.175 --> 00:44:33.256]  When I filled out my ticket, this is an amazing story, actually,
[00:44:34.798 --> 00:44:38.179]  500 tickets were sold out in less than 24 hours.
[00:44:38.579 --> 00:44:41.600]  You wouldn't have that kind of result for a Hillary event, I promise you.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.941]  But when I got my ticket, there was no checkbox.
[00:44:45.001 --> 00:44:47.021]  It didn't ask what gender I was.
[00:44:47.081 --> 00:44:49.342]  It didn't ask what color my skin was.
[00:44:49.802 --> 00:44:52.463]  In fact, it didn't even ask if I was a Trump supporter!
[00:44:53.363 --> 00:44:55.887]  It just said, hey, this is a deplorable event.
[00:44:56.207 --> 00:44:57.509]  Trump supporters are going to be there.
[00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:58.631]  We like capitalism.
[00:44:58.931 --> 00:44:59.993]  We got 500 tickets.
[00:45:00.073 --> 00:45:01.655]  Buy your ticket and come if you want to come.
[00:45:01.675 --> 00:45:04.139]  If you're an American that likes Trump, that's what we're here to do.
[00:45:04.519 --> 00:45:05.340]  And that's what happened.
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:06.061]  But like I said.
[00:45:07.045 --> 00:45:16.714]  We fully expect, and I'm going to be at the Deplora Ball myself, me and Rob Dew will be there covering this, and I'm expecting to see some social justice warriors.
[00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:27.403]  Maybe a few will actually infiltrate the event, get inside, and then of course maybe there'll be some on the outskirts just wishing they could be inside but protesting it like the little children that they are.
[00:45:27.463 --> 00:45:30.066]  Now, it's been said by Jack Posobiec
[00:45:30.933 --> 00:45:37.917]  Who is one of the head organizers of this, that they've had many other venues reach out to try to host the event.
[00:45:37.957 --> 00:45:39.237]  Of course, why wouldn't you want to?
[00:45:39.277 --> 00:45:39.938]  We're capitalists.
[00:45:39.978 --> 00:45:50.583]  Why would you not want to take people's money unless you are a total cuck to social justice warriors like apparently the original location operatives were?
[00:45:51.023 --> 00:45:52.864]  But now we're going to have more room.
[00:45:53.024 --> 00:45:54.305]  It's doubled in size.
[00:45:54.665 --> 00:45:56.406]  So how do you like that, fellow deplorables?
[00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:58.529]  We now have a bigger venue.
[00:45:59.250 --> 00:45:59.530]  You know what?
[00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:00.610]  I'm going to bring a bigger cigar!
[00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:03.391]  My original cigar was only going to be about this big.
[00:46:03.431 --> 00:46:04.752]  Now my cigar is going to be huge.
[00:46:04.772 --> 00:46:06.532]  I'm going to bring the biggest cigar I can find.
[00:46:06.872 --> 00:46:08.453]  Thank you so much, Social Justice Warriors.
[00:46:08.473 --> 00:46:09.593]  We got a bigger event now.
[00:46:09.653 --> 00:46:14.475]  Like I said, over 500 tickets sold out in under 24 hours.
[00:46:14.535 --> 00:46:17.416]  Now this to me dovetails on a story I covered earlier.
[00:46:18.627 --> 00:46:28.540]  Universities in America are telling their students how to host parties as to not be offensive to people that don't celebrate Christmas.
[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:33.025]  Well, I don't understand what's so offensive about Christmas to begin with, but nonetheless,
[00:46:33.956 --> 00:46:43.683]  What you've got here is universities trying to tell you how to celebrate Christmas, and you've got social justice warriors trying to swoop in and infringe upon our fun.
[00:46:44.103 --> 00:46:45.845]  Look, all we wanted to do was have an event.
[00:46:45.945 --> 00:46:47.386]  You can have all the events you want.
[00:46:47.606 --> 00:46:48.827]  We don't protest your events.
[00:46:48.947 --> 00:46:50.308]  I don't go protest Hillary events.
[00:46:50.408 --> 00:46:52.289]  I don't go protest other religion symbols.
[00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:56.432]  No, we are all open, all loving, and completely for this.
[00:46:56.692 --> 00:46:58.494]  I'll see you at the Deplora Ball.
[00:47:03.021 --> 00:47:11.162]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.143 --> 00:47:20.944]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.364 --> 00:47:25.205]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.225 --> 00:47:28.326]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.726 --> 00:47:29.806]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.
[00:47:53.493 --> 00:47:54.533]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.

[00:48:59.639 --> 00:49:02.303]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:13.672 --> 00:49:19.813]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com and I want to talk about the de-evolution of our college campuses all across this great nation.
[00:49:19.913 --> 00:49:22.754]  I want to share with you a big secret today.
[00:49:24.074 --> 00:49:27.515]  And it's not one that a lot of you are going to want to hear.
[00:49:28.715 --> 00:49:32.236]  But at the same time it's so important that I have to tell you.
[00:49:34.176 --> 00:49:34.956]  And that secret is this.
[00:49:36.456 --> 00:49:39.737]  What if I told you that every single day kids go to school
[00:49:40.834 --> 00:49:42.415]  They become less intelligent.
[00:49:42.715 --> 00:49:51.802]  The fact that it's no longer safe for students to go in and share their ideas, unless those ideas come from the left and are very liberal-leaning.
[00:49:52.422 --> 00:50:01.049]  Please keep your comments to the Q&A session.
[00:50:13.216 --> 00:50:18.282]  But if you're a conservative, it's almost like a war zone for you to even go onto a campus nowadays.
[00:50:18.822 --> 00:50:24.388]  You can be physically and verbally abused just for thinking outside of the box.
[00:50:24.929 --> 00:50:29.453]  Now college campuses are supposed to be environments where you, as a young adult,
[00:50:30.154 --> 00:50:34.738]  Learn and find out who you are and what your values are going to be and what it is you believe in.
[00:50:35.118 --> 00:50:46.107]  And you're supposed to be able to use this environment as a way to debate and have conversations and bounce ideas off and really come up with new ideas on how to change the world.
[00:50:46.507 --> 00:50:54.153]  But that's so hard to do when you are completely and totally attacked from one side of the conversation.
[00:50:54.814 --> 00:50:55.994]  Now what I want to talk about is
[00:50:57.042 --> 00:50:58.683]  You know, in fact, how that is happening.
[00:50:59.083 --> 00:51:02.205]  Look at what happened at the Portland State students for Trump meeting.
[00:51:02.585 --> 00:51:06.967]  They were in a open area where they're allowed to be there and have a discussion.
[00:51:07.327 --> 00:51:12.029]  And they were essentially shut down by a group of leftists that didn't like what they were talking about.
[00:51:12.409 --> 00:51:17.612]  And the fact that they liked Donald Trump and they supported him and wanted to do something to help him get elected.
[00:51:18.052 --> 00:51:18.873]  That's fine.
[00:51:19.353 --> 00:51:21.634]  That's politics on a college campus.
[00:51:21.994 --> 00:51:23.475]  That is supposed to happen.
[00:51:23.795 --> 00:51:29.703]  Now this is what it looks like to actually get in the way of what might be my mission.
[00:51:55.309 --> 00:52:06.674]  Then you have the actual professor at Missouri who called for muscle because a reporter clearly wanted to go in and ask some questions about some kids who were in their safe space.
[00:52:07.575 --> 00:52:08.935]  I know that's a really good one.
[00:52:09.015 --> 00:52:12.937]  I'm a communication faculty and I really get that argument, but you need to go.
[00:52:13.398 --> 00:52:16.119]  She's seen trying to intimidate another cameraman.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.523]  David Kirpius is the Dean of the Journalism School.
[00:52:24.763 --> 00:52:32.452]  I certainly don't condone the act of trying to prevent a journalist from doing his job.
[00:52:32.973 --> 00:52:36.978]  And I don't condone the act of trying to escalate the situation.
[00:52:37.518 --> 00:52:48.847]  And now we have this instance at Orange Coast College in California, where Olga Perez Stable Cox goes on this anti-Trump tirade during a sexuality class.
[00:52:48.947 --> 00:52:55.692]  I don't know what sexuality has to do with an anti-Trump rant, but she saw fit that that should happen at this point in time.
[00:52:56.013 --> 00:53:01.797]  Now, this video has gone viral and came out last week, and I want to give you guys some updates about this story.
[00:53:02.178 --> 00:53:03.539]  It's pretty interesting to see that
[00:53:04.039 --> 00:53:06.561]  When you're pro-Trump, you get shut down, and that's okay.
[00:53:06.581 --> 00:53:07.561]  The media loves it.
[00:53:07.882 --> 00:53:08.622]  They coddle you.
[00:53:08.682 --> 00:53:18.709]  They put you on TV, and everyone's like, oh my god, this guy is such a hero, or she's such a hero, she stood up to the big fascist bullies who supported Trump.
[00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:23.433]  No, what happened here was, is the left finally got called out on their BS.
[00:53:24.153 --> 00:53:28.414]  And the reaction to it is the most interesting part about it.
[00:53:28.874 --> 00:53:37.196]  Now this professor says that Donald Trump is a white supremacist and the governor-elect Mike Pence is the most anti-gay human in the country.
[00:53:39.477 --> 00:53:40.337]  That's pretty factless.
[00:53:40.357 --> 00:53:41.277]  That's pretty baseless.
[00:53:41.317 --> 00:53:42.498]  Where did this even come from?
[00:53:43.638 --> 00:53:45.839]  But she says that and everything's fine.
[00:53:45.899 --> 00:53:49.420]  Most people in the classroom are probably like, that's pretty true.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.540]  I saw it on MSNBC.
[00:53:51.886 --> 00:53:55.209]  Then she goes on to say that we are in for a difficult time.
[00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:59.212]  But again, I do believe that we can get past this extreme time.
[00:53:59.592 --> 00:54:02.375]  Our nation is divided, but we have been assaulted.
[00:54:03.335 --> 00:54:04.817]  And it's an act of terrorism.
[00:54:05.497 --> 00:54:17.027]  Now a student that's a part of a Republican group in the college filmed this entire rant from this professor that simply just was so triggered by President-elect Trump.
[00:54:18.336 --> 00:54:22.158]  That she thought that pretty much everybody in her classroom thought the same way she did.
[00:54:22.798 --> 00:54:25.259]  And that it was okay to be that kind of person.
[00:54:25.739 --> 00:54:26.740]  But that's out of control.
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:28.861]  And now the video's gone viral.
[00:54:29.381 --> 00:54:31.602]  The students have been threatened with expulsion.
[00:54:32.082 --> 00:54:37.365]  And it's gotten to such a point where she says she's been getting threats and has had to leave the state.
[00:54:37.785 --> 00:54:44.088]  Multiple professors, multiple students were in support of her, showed up, protested.
[00:54:44.628 --> 00:54:55.131]  Because it's her right in a college that's supposed to be diverse for conversation, where students are supposed to be open and talk about the many things that they're feeling.
[00:54:56.431 --> 00:55:01.932]  But it's only allowed when it's liberal left BS propaganda.
[00:55:02.292 --> 00:55:03.493]  And she's like this hero now.
[00:55:03.533 --> 00:55:13.035]  She's had to flee the mean Trump supporters and is now hiding from the fascist, evil Trump dwellers, the deplorables.
[00:55:13.882 --> 00:55:15.322]  Who just called her out on her B.S.
[00:55:16.163 --> 00:55:24.826]  Now if the roles were flipped in reverse, this professor, who let's say goes on a pro-Trump rant, would probably be fired within days.
[00:55:25.426 --> 00:55:34.609]  Because so many people were just triggered and they needed a safe space and they had to do cry-ins and put safety pins so they could all stand in solidarity with one another.
[00:55:35.469 --> 00:55:37.170]  This is reality.
[00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:40.111]  Trump will be your president.
[00:55:40.971 --> 00:55:41.991]  And safety pins.
[00:55:42.892 --> 00:55:43.572]  And coddling.
[00:55:44.775 --> 00:55:49.860]  And coping skills and cry-ins aren't going to change that fact.
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.802]  Everyone needs to be upset that this is going on.
[00:55:53.082 --> 00:56:00.209]  We shouldn't be paying all this money to send our children to go be brainwashed at these colleges.
[00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:07.955]  It's time to stand up for the right thing to do and it's time for us to take a stand for freedom of speech.
[00:56:08.556 --> 00:56:11.779]  This has been Joe Biggs reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:56:24.578 --> 00:56:27.944]  Every TV, every news outlet, Russian influence.
[00:56:28.124 --> 00:56:29.026]  I'm a Russian agent.
[00:56:29.747 --> 00:56:30.889]  I thought I was American.
[00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:32.312]  I thought I worked for InfoWars.
[00:56:33.752 --> 00:56:34.753]  What is going on?
[00:56:35.133 --> 00:56:36.695]  Putin, get out of my head.
[00:56:37.255 --> 00:56:38.917]  Russia, get out of my elections.
[00:56:39.157 --> 00:56:41.339]  But wait, no, I work for Infowars.
[00:56:41.399 --> 00:56:41.940]  I'm American.
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:43.101]  I want to make America great again.
[00:56:43.461 --> 00:56:47.285]  Trump's an American citizen, but they keep saying his appointments are Russian affiliated.
[00:56:47.525 --> 00:56:49.607]  Everyone he works with is a Russian agent.
[00:56:50.188 --> 00:56:51.369]  Donald Trump works for Russia.
[00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:53.371]  I can't handle this anymore.
[00:56:53.411 --> 00:56:53.951]  Who am I?
[00:56:54.312 --> 00:56:55.393]  Who am I working for?
[00:56:56.133 --> 00:56:57.554]  I want to make America great again.
[00:56:57.594 --> 00:56:59.656]  I don't want Russia to be my boss.
[00:56:59.736 --> 00:57:01.638]  I don't need Russia influencing my elections.
[00:57:02.578 --> 00:57:04.580]  I just, I just want to be a reporter in America.
[00:57:05.601 --> 00:57:06.462]  Why is Russia?
[00:57:07.362 --> 00:57:08.103]  Am I Russian?
[00:57:08.483 --> 00:57:09.624]  I don't even understand.
[00:57:10.024 --> 00:57:10.805]  Is this a Russian?
[00:57:12.707 --> 00:57:13.507]  Agent Cameron Schroier.
[00:57:13.527 --> 00:57:14.468]  Yes, Putin.
[00:57:30.939 --> 00:57:37.304]  And that's how Donald Trump became the greatest presidential election in American history, without any Russian influence at all.
[00:57:37.745 --> 00:57:41.568]  Now here's a word from our sponsors with the Kremlin, I mean, InfoWars.com.
[00:57:41.588 --> 00:57:45.471]  Well that's it for tonight's news.
[00:57:45.491 --> 00:57:46.452]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:57:46.472 --> 00:57:51.076]  Join us again tomorrow night at 7 central, 8pm eastern for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:57:51.156 --> 00:57:51.737]  I'm David Knight.
[00:57:57.290 --> 00:58:06.859]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:58:07.319 --> 00:58:09.041]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:58:09.221 --> 00:58:09.781]  Think about it.
[00:58:09.981 --> 00:58:15.767]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interest.
[00:58:16.027 --> 00:58:21.592]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:58:21.972 --> 00:58:33.740]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.762]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:58:36.962 --> 00:58:39.443]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:58:39.763 --> 00:58:44.206]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:58:44.647 --> 00:58:45.207]  Think about it.
[00:58:45.427 --> 00:58:56.617]  This is Darren McBreen and I want you to break the matrix at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and listen to the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on in your mind.
[00:59:04.133 --> 00:59:09.917]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.378 --> 00:59:20.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:29.387]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.787 --> 00:59:36.008]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.308 --> 00:59:38.608]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:39.268 --> 00:59:41.709]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:59:42.089 --> 00:59:47.590]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:54.693]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
[00:59:55.053 --> 00:59:59.895]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
