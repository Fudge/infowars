[00:00:20.188 --> 00:00:26.694]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome in to the nightly news, this Monday night Labor Day special.
[00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:29.536]  I hope that everybody is enjoying their time off.
[00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:31.618]  I hope that everybody is enjoying their Labor Day.
[00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:42.048]  And while we enjoy the cold beverages and the juicy meats and the juicy vegetables and the smell of charcoal and barbecue, maybe you're out on the lake boating with friends and family,
[00:00:42.648 --> 00:00:45.673]  Let's just remember how important America is.
[00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:47.175]  How important freedom is.
[00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:48.778]  How important liberty is.
[00:00:49.178 --> 00:00:52.724]  And that's what we here at InfoWars are striving to protect.
[00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.727]  You can't have liberty without vigilance.
[00:00:57.148 --> 00:01:08.733]  So even though we take time off on this Labor Day to enjoy the privileges and freedoms of being an American, let's also recall that it takes vigilance of our leaders in order to ensure that freedom.
[00:01:09.113 --> 00:01:13.135]  And that's why InfoWars.com is committed to the fight for liberty.
[00:01:13.796 --> 00:01:16.477]  This is the Labor Day Nightly News Special.
[00:01:30.188 --> 00:01:34.593]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:01:34.673 --> 00:01:45.605]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:01:45.765 --> 00:01:50.689]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:53.331]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:54.872]  It helps detoxify.
[00:01:55.112 --> 00:01:57.915]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:01:57.995 --> 00:02:02.739]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:06.902]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:02:07.322 --> 00:02:14.326]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:15.867]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:16.787]  This is so key.
[00:02:17.047 --> 00:02:21.349]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:23.471]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:02:23.591 --> 00:02:27.052]  Exclusively available at M4WarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:02:30.254 --> 00:02:39.861]  Now we are introducing a new t-shirt, which I think folks need to get, telling the real truth about Bill Clinton, who is a serial rapist and a user of women.
[00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:43.764]  In another case, it's about groping and fondling and touching against a woman's will.
[00:02:43.924 --> 00:02:44.304]  And rape.
[00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:44.845]  And rape.
[00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:49.088]  Bill rapes them physically, and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:49.788]  He's a rapist.
[00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.749]  Absolutely.
[00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.050]  He's a public figure, he goes straight to hell.
[00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:14.874]  So Colin Kaepernick again has decided he's going to sit during the National Anthem and this was even more selfish, more arrogant than the first time because he chose to do this on military night.
[00:03:15.134 --> 00:03:20.135]  He couldn't put his own political agendas aside for the military.
[00:03:21.175 --> 00:03:23.176]  That is selfishness, folks.
[00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:25.518]  That is selfishness, at least in my opinion.
[00:03:25.818 --> 00:03:28.820]  So let's try to figure out exactly what's going on with Colin Kaepernick.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.801]  Let's try to tie it into some history.
[00:03:31.681 --> 00:03:38.405]  And let's try to maybe even extend an offer to Colin Kaepernick to maybe voice some of his opinions on the show.
[00:03:38.445 --> 00:03:41.027]  But first, let's try to figure out what's going on and maybe even inform Colin.
[00:03:41.567 --> 00:03:49.332]  So first of all, it's interesting to note that Colin Kaepernick, as many people know by now, converted to the religion of Islam in the off season.
[00:03:49.992 --> 00:03:58.939]  Now, he's also engaged to a well-known Black Lives Matter activist who is DJ Nessa Diab on Hot 97.
[00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:09.987]  Now, she's been very vocal about her support of Black Lives Matter, and when I was looking into her, I found her logo to be very, very suspicious, folks.
[00:04:10.527 --> 00:04:13.029]  You might want to check out the logo.
[00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.534]  There it is, the nice little Illuminati pyramid.
[00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:19.215]  Look at that!
[00:04:20.436 --> 00:04:28.724]  So there's the official logo for Colin Kaepernick's fiancÃ©'s radio show, an Illuminati pyramid.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.681]  So what do you think about that?
[00:04:31.761 --> 00:04:34.304]  I wonder if Colin Kaepernick has any idea about that.
[00:04:34.624 --> 00:04:42.710]  Colin Kaepernick has now been joined by other NFL players, such as teammate Eric Reid and the Seattle Seahawks' Jeremy Lane.
[00:04:43.191 --> 00:04:47.034]  And he's doing this in the face of a lot of rejection.
[00:04:47.094 --> 00:04:48.895]  He was booed in San Diego.
[00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:49.956]  There were a lot of jeers.
[00:04:50.236 --> 00:04:53.779]  When he walked into the clubhouse, he got booed and shouted out.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.822]  But it does appear that he does have the support
[00:04:57.302 --> 00:05:01.165]  Of his teammates and other people around the league.
[00:05:01.405 --> 00:05:09.730]  Now Colin Kaepernick says that he's not anti-American and that he loves America and he wants to help make America better.
[00:05:10.431 --> 00:05:13.353]  I'm not sure if he's going about this the right way.
[00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:23.980]  I'm not sure how the divide and conquer tactic that Colin Kaepernick is using is going about helping America in the right way.
[00:05:25.225 --> 00:05:32.529]  I think that this creates the divide between police and citizens, and that's exactly what people like George Soros want.
[00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:34.670]  But we'll get into that in a matter of time.
[00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:41.894]  But wearing socks with a pig in a cop hat doesn't help America.
[00:05:42.334 --> 00:05:54.300]  And I thought if I was the owner or coach of the 49ers as soon as I saw, or an NFL exec, as soon as I saw Colin Kaepernick do this, I would have cut him immediately.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.464]  I would have wanted nothing to do with that player anymore.
[00:05:58.684 --> 00:06:00.386]  That cannot be good for a clubhouse.
[00:06:00.586 --> 00:06:02.187]  That cannot be good for America.
[00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:17.642]  And it's interesting, a story out of the Daily Mail says that some NFL execs are not happy with Colin Kaepernick, and there's even rumors that he might be done playing professional football.
[00:06:18.661 --> 00:06:20.202]  I don't know if that's true or not.
[00:06:20.282 --> 00:06:26.566]  He did play last night, and he actually played pretty well, something he was concerned about.
[00:06:27.967 --> 00:06:41.615]  Now, he did say he's going to donate $1 million to causes of issues that he sees being put in the spotlight, such as racial inequality and police brutality.
[00:06:42.822 --> 00:06:51.806]  I wonder if that $1 million is going to go to Black Lives Matter, the NAACP, some other form, maybe even, how about this, maybe a police organization.
[00:06:52.146 --> 00:06:57.409]  Maybe towards the families of the victims of the Dallas police shooting.
[00:06:57.549 --> 00:07:00.090]  So let's see where Colin Kaepernick gives his $1 million.
[00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.173]  Boy, what an oppressed human being that can just give away a million dollars.
[00:07:05.513 --> 00:07:07.974]  Must be tough to be Colin Kaepernick.
[00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:17.542]  Now, Colin has said that this is all a misunderstanding, that his points are being misconstrued, and I think that Colin Kaepernick is the one that is confused in this issue.
[00:07:17.742 --> 00:07:19.984]  But hey, maybe we aren't understanding Colin Kaepernick.
[00:07:20.044 --> 00:07:24.008]  Maybe he needs to come on InfoWars.com and do an interview.
[00:07:24.368 --> 00:07:24.628]  You know what?
[00:07:24.768 --> 00:07:26.189]  Let's actually get into this angle.
[00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:32.755]  You know, Colin Kaepernick is not the first player to do this on a national stage, on a professional athlete stage.
[00:07:33.055 --> 00:07:34.377]  Before Colin Kaepernick did it,
[00:07:35.077 --> 00:07:37.498]  An NBA player did the same thing.
[00:07:38.378 --> 00:07:47.780]  His name was Abdul Rauf and he was converted to Islam just before he did his protest as well.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:54.201]  So that's an interesting angle that they convert to Islam and then they want to protest the national anthem and the American flag.
[00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:57.142]  Boy, we should bring more of these people to this country, shouldn't we?
[00:07:57.342 --> 00:07:58.802]  People that want to protest the flag.
[00:07:59.002 --> 00:08:00.983]  What do you think that's going to do to America, Colin?
[00:08:01.263 --> 00:08:11.165]  You say you want to help America, but how do you think that's going to help America when people convert to Islam, they don't want to honor the flag or the national anthem, and then we're going to bring these people in by the millions.
[00:08:11.365 --> 00:08:12.765]  That's not going to help America.
[00:08:13.706 --> 00:08:20.747]  But it's a different reception that was received in 96 while Rauf's career was ended, folks.
[00:08:21.087 --> 00:08:21.987]  His career was ended.
[00:08:22.027 --> 00:08:23.388]  He could never play the same again.
[00:08:23.608 --> 00:08:24.988]  The media criticized him.
[00:08:26.044 --> 00:08:36.931]  He was suspended from the NBA for his protest, and of course, you know, he's so vindicated in his religious beliefs, they took away his paycheck, and all of a sudden his protest stopped.
[00:08:37.432 --> 00:08:39.493]  So, that's how vindicated he was in his beliefs.
[00:08:39.733 --> 00:08:44.457]  Of course, he still says that he's glad he did it to this day.
[00:08:45.382 --> 00:08:47.623]  But he lost his paycheck.
[00:08:48.444 --> 00:08:49.445]  He lost his career.
[00:08:49.485 --> 00:08:50.865]  He was demonized in the media.
[00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.907]  People completely rejected his protest.
[00:08:53.667 --> 00:09:01.012]  But now, in the modern day of the liberal media, running our train of thought, it's okay.
[00:09:01.072 --> 00:09:06.375]  He doesn't get suspended, and he gets basically endorsed by the NFL, folks.
[00:09:06.475 --> 00:09:07.155]  I'm telling you this.
[00:09:07.375 --> 00:09:08.076]  This was shocking.
[00:09:09.099 --> 00:09:17.246]  I'm watching this game and the coverage on CBS and the coverage on the NFL networks were totally pro-Kaepernick.
[00:09:17.426 --> 00:09:18.887]  They endorsed him the whole time.
[00:09:19.128 --> 00:09:24.292]  They gave him more camera time and more recognition than any of the veterans that were in Qualcomm Stadium.
[00:09:24.893 --> 00:09:28.015]  More than the Chief Petty Officer that sang the National Anthem.
[00:09:28.396 --> 00:09:30.978]  CBS didn't even mention the Chief Petty Officer's name.
[00:09:31.278 --> 00:09:36.882]  I had to listen to the PA, try to hear the PA over the broadcasters, just to find out who this Chief Petty Officer was.
[00:09:37.263 --> 00:09:38.584]  No respect for the military.
[00:09:38.904 --> 00:09:39.925]  No regard for the vets.
[00:09:40.165 --> 00:09:44.128]  It's all about Colin Kaepernick's protest on CBS and NFL.
[00:09:44.308 --> 00:09:45.269]  That's disgusting.
[00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.270]  Now...
[00:09:47.591 --> 00:09:53.115]  Here are some comments that Stephen A. Smith has made regarding the matter.
[00:09:53.396 --> 00:10:04.764]  But in this particular instance, he really would have to be black to understand, and more importantly, he would need to be black to really make the kind of statement that he made.
[00:10:05.065 --> 00:10:10.189]  So Stephen A. Smith, in my opinion, illustrates the double standard in this society.
[00:10:10.689 --> 00:10:23.839]  Where Stephen A. Smith says that a white man can't hold an opinion on a black man's perspective but then it's okay for Stephen A. Smith as a black man to assume he understands what it's like as a white man.
[00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:28.002]  So that is a complete double standard coming from that point of view.
[00:10:28.222 --> 00:10:31.825]  Completely bogus and at the end of the day it's just a divide and conquer tactic anyway.
[00:10:32.105 --> 00:10:33.586]  But ESPN goes further folks.
[00:10:33.626 --> 00:10:34.707]  Paul Feinbaum came out
[00:10:35.327 --> 00:10:41.290]  And spoke out against Colin Kaepernick with a black man on air who agreed that black people are not being oppressed in America.
[00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:52.375]  His sidekick agreed when Paul Feinbaum said that, but the next day, the next day, ESPN made Paul Feinbaum apologize.
[00:10:53.607 --> 00:11:04.937]  In what was one of the most weak, disgusting, cowardly things I've ever seen Paul Feinbaum do, apologize for his true feelings and comments.
[00:11:04.957 --> 00:11:05.577]  That's disgusting.
[00:11:05.757 --> 00:11:10.862]  But it's just like the basketball player who, as soon as he found out he was losing his paycheck, his protest stopped.
[00:11:11.082 --> 00:11:16.446]  I'm sure ESPN called up Mr. Feinbaum and said, hey, you better take that back or you're fired.
[00:11:16.626 --> 00:11:19.369]  That's millions of dollars on the table that he didn't want to lose.
[00:11:19.629 --> 00:11:21.531]  And of course, this is the same ESPN
[00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:25.349]  That prints out a story endorsing Colin Kaepernick.
[00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:28.272]  You can knock Colin Kaepernick, but don't call him un-American.
[00:11:28.532 --> 00:11:30.313]  And here's what it comes down to for me at the end of the day.
[00:11:30.373 --> 00:11:35.177]  Again, I think that Colin Kaepernick trying to bring real issues to light is a good thing.
[00:11:35.237 --> 00:11:39.500]  I think him using his celebrity and the stage of the NFL is a good thing.
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.961]  I think athletes getting involved is a good thing.
[00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:47.086]  My problem is, he's completely misinformed, and I'm curious if he knows who George Soros is, because this is very important, folks.
[00:11:48.513 --> 00:11:59.363]  When Black Lives Matter is being used to create a divide between the cops and citizens, or black and white people, this is not helping America.
[00:11:59.623 --> 00:12:01.765]  This is a George Soros operation.
[00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:11.113]  Now, we need to understand, when George Soros is funding Black Lives Matter and funding civil arrest in this country, he's not doing it to help America, okay?
[00:12:11.373 --> 00:12:14.376]  What he's doing is trying to create a situation
[00:12:14.716 --> 00:12:18.478]  Where he can reasonably bring about the federalization of police.
[00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:22.260]  This is a man who's been given millions of dollars to Black Lives Matter.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.703]  This is the same man whose goal is to federalize America's police.
[00:12:26.963 --> 00:12:28.764]  So I got a question for you, Colin Kaepernick.
[00:12:29.204 --> 00:12:35.427]  If you think there's a problem with policing in America, do you really think that federalizing the police is going to help?
[00:12:35.647 --> 00:12:38.189]  Do you really think that giving more power to a
[00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.673]  Larger police system is going to help.
[00:12:40.934 --> 00:12:42.016]  Of course it's not going to help.
[00:12:42.236 --> 00:12:45.884]  So I invite Colin Kaepernick to Infowars.com to voice his opinion.
[00:12:46.144 --> 00:12:49.571]  Let's see him stand up and talk about real issues in America.
[00:13:07.441 --> 00:13:13.264]  It was 17 years ago, just north of Austin, Texas in Waco, that I met Jon Ronson.
[00:13:13.804 --> 00:13:19.207]  And Jon was already a successful documentary filmmaker from BBC and also Channel 4.
[00:13:20.187 --> 00:13:21.088]  He had an idea.
[00:13:21.128 --> 00:13:23.649]  He was making a documentary on Waco, but he had an idea.
[00:13:23.709 --> 00:13:34.394]  He wanted to infiltrate Bohemian Grove in Northern California and see if Republican leaders were really involved in all these weird activities, a la Skull and Bones.
[00:13:34.434 --> 00:13:35.455]  But that's another story.
[00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:51.505]  Since then he's written so many best-selling books and one of them was The Psychopath Test that even many psychiatrists and psychologists say is a must read and really made them rethink a lot of things because he talked to a lot of experts.
[00:13:51.545 --> 00:13:56.329]  So I wanted to ask him today in a brief interview for the Nightly News.
[00:13:58.007 --> 00:14:16.540]  What he thinks of the Atlantic Monthly and the Washington Post and Vanity Fair and everybody else, basically doing assessments of Hillary Clinton, assessments of Donald Trump from afar, and what he makes of that when he is the author of The Psychopath Test.
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:23.264]  So first, recap the book, break down what the body of thought is, not just from yourself, but others.
[00:14:23.304 --> 00:14:24.886]  John Ronson again, thanks for being here.
[00:14:25.686 --> 00:14:36.550]  Yeah, I wrote this book, The Psychopath Test, and as part of the research for the book, I went on a course that taught me how to identify psychopaths.
[00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:52.995]  And so I went on this course, and the guy who ran the course, who's like the father of modern psychopathy studies, a very kind of revered and respected man called Robert Hare, said that one of his great regrets in life was that he spent all of his
[00:14:53.795 --> 00:15:00.980]  time researching prison psychopaths, when in fact what he should have been doing was researching corporate psychopaths.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:11.086]  Because he said one of the most extraordinary things about the way that our world works is that you're four times more likely to have a psychopath at the top of the tree than at the bottom.
[00:15:11.407 --> 00:15:17.951]  That psychopathy is such a powerful brain anomaly, it remoulds society all wrong.
[00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:26.275]  I think the assessment was that Donald Trump would try and do some things to appeal to the middle of the electorate, to appeal to suburban college-educated women.
[00:15:26.315 --> 00:15:26.816]  He's not.
[00:15:26.876 --> 00:15:28.937]  I mean, basically we have a psychopath running for president.
[00:15:29.377 --> 00:15:38.442]  So, when Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton came along, obviously a huge number of mainstream outlets
[00:15:39.002 --> 00:15:39.322]  It's immoral.
[00:15:56.852 --> 00:15:58.093]  It's kind of psychopathic.
[00:15:58.353 --> 00:16:01.716]  When you see someone who you think has problems, you know it.
[00:16:02.416 --> 00:16:06.379]  And there's not anybody at this table who doesn't think he has some sort of problem.
[00:16:06.439 --> 00:16:07.900]  Let's ask the questions.
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.141]  Let's do this at this point.
[00:16:09.361 --> 00:16:12.323]  You know, the DSM, their manual is, you know, it's like a book.
[00:16:12.403 --> 00:16:12.843]  Brick.
[00:16:12.903 --> 00:16:14.403]  It's full of mental disorders.
[00:16:14.443 --> 00:16:15.364]  Mental disorders everywhere.
[00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:22.645]  But they basically sent out a ruling saying psychiatrists don't do this.
[00:16:22.865 --> 00:16:27.106]  Don't diagnose Donald Trump from afar as a psychopath.
[00:16:27.846 --> 00:16:31.467]  And what they invoked was a thing called the Goldwater Rule.
[00:16:32.227 --> 00:16:35.748]  And basically when Barry Goldwater was running for president
[00:16:36.568 --> 00:16:36.929]  Thank you.
[00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:54.227]  Don't contact me again.
[00:16:54.247 --> 00:17:01.050]  But then like a thousand of them replied, said, you know, no, Barry Goldwater has, you know, mummy issues.
[00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.211]  Barry Goldwater's schizophrenic.
[00:17:03.311 --> 00:17:05.272]  Barry Goldwater's bipolar.
[00:17:05.713 --> 00:17:08.514]  And it was so unethical for these people to do that.
[00:17:08.554 --> 00:17:18.039]  And it made the American psychiatric industry look terrible, you know, because you can't just sort of declare somebody insane without having met them and evaluated them and so on.
[00:17:18.399 --> 00:17:25.542]  Wait a minute, do you really think, diagnosing people on air, I assume you don't have a degree in psychology.
[00:17:25.882 --> 00:17:26.523]  Is that fair?
[00:17:26.643 --> 00:17:30.024]  I mean, we're jumping to conclusions here.
[00:17:30.044 --> 00:17:32.925]  I think this is what gets voters a little frustrated with this campaign.
[00:17:32.945 --> 00:17:33.826]  Well, you know, listen.
[00:17:33.846 --> 00:17:36.547]  I think there's an issue here.
[00:17:36.987 --> 00:17:41.809]  First of all, a psychiatrist cannot come on and diagnose somebody.
[00:17:41.949 --> 00:17:45.811]  No, but they can talk about the character traits that we are seeing repetitively here.
[00:17:45.851 --> 00:17:47.412]  We may try to figure that out.
[00:17:47.732 --> 00:17:49.413]  David Plouffe said psychopath.
[00:17:49.473 --> 00:17:50.474]  I think he misspoke.
[00:17:50.534 --> 00:17:52.915]  I think he meant sociopath.
[00:17:52.935 --> 00:17:53.816]  There is a difference.
[00:17:53.836 --> 00:17:56.077]  But I think we need to be very careful here.
[00:17:56.537 --> 00:17:58.659]  So the APA said, don't do this with Trump.
[00:17:58.999 --> 00:18:00.040]  But everyone's ignored it.
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:08.845]  And in fact, a thing came out just yesterday from an Oxford University professor saying, you know, Donald Trump is more of a psychopath than Adolf Hitler.
[00:18:09.245 --> 00:18:13.768]  For people who aren't psychopaths, people who do have empathy,
[00:18:15.749 --> 00:18:27.174]  You know, behaving cruelly or psychopathically hurts because you feel remorse, you feel guilt, and those are like painful feelings.
[00:18:27.294 --> 00:18:28.254]  It's a brain thing.
[00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:30.055]  You've got the amygdala, you've got the central nervous system.
[00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:33.036]  And the psychopaths think they're advanced because they don't feel it.
[00:18:33.336 --> 00:18:34.417]  The truth is they're crippled.
[00:18:34.677 --> 00:18:35.577]  Yes, exactly.
[00:18:35.777 --> 00:18:37.978]  John Ronson, it's been amazing talking to you.
[00:18:37.998 --> 00:18:38.878]  It was great to see you again.
[00:18:38.898 --> 00:18:39.959]  Alex, it was great to see you.
[00:19:12.204 --> 00:19:15.867]  He who controls the trends, controls the future.
[00:19:16.687 --> 00:19:20.810]  He who controls the future, controls the destiny of humanity.
[00:19:22.991 --> 00:19:27.934]  My friends, the globalist social engineers are obsessed
[00:19:28.809 --> 00:19:53.099]  with creating false memes false trends that they control to create a population of trendies from those false trends that don't have their own destiny who don't even have a basic organic human genetic drive to build something
[00:19:54.778 --> 00:20:01.501]  That is satisfying, trailblazing, and innately independent and human.
[00:20:02.481 --> 00:20:07.123]  And if you understand this paradigm, you understand all the others.
[00:20:07.663 --> 00:20:20.348]  One of hundreds of memes and trends we've been successfully able to launch and force into the consciousness is a Operation Against Hillary Clinton we launched 10 months ago with the Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[00:20:21.329 --> 00:20:24.050]  It's now been duplicated by countless groups and I think that's wonderful.
[00:20:25.034 --> 00:20:31.958]  Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and now it's all over CNN, it's all over Fox, it's all over the Trump rallies, the Hillary rallies.
[00:20:32.299 --> 00:20:39.383]  The number one search term for a week straight last week, and it's still continuing, one of the top search terms is, is Hillary going to jail?
[00:20:39.723 --> 00:20:46.468]  This has been incredibly successful, because it shows, despite corporate control and despite them trying to control the meme,
[00:20:47.068 --> 00:21:03.980]  We are able to synergistically wear our colors loud and proud against injustice, corruption, and oppression, and show that we, humans, not the globalist controllers, but the common little people, can set the trends, can set the memes.
[00:21:04.821 --> 00:21:07.142]  We've had three versions of the Hillary for Prison shirt.
[00:21:07.662 --> 00:21:11.083]  All of them have been collector's edition and have helped fund the InfoWar.
[00:21:11.664 --> 00:21:14.225]  We now have a third edition in.
[00:21:14.465 --> 00:21:15.785]  The second edition sold out.
[00:21:16.145 --> 00:21:32.692]  It's the same as the last, but on the right shoulder says InfoWars.com, on the back it says InfoWars.com, legalized freedom, be part of history, be part of supporting the InfoWar, be part of meeting like-minded friends and family.
[00:21:33.809 --> 00:21:49.114]  And be part of breaking out of their paradigm and setting the agenda, setting the trend, setting the true, organic, teleprompter-free reawakening of humanity.

[00:22:02.073 --> 00:22:02.873]  Come on, Hillary.
[00:22:03.054 --> 00:22:03.654]  Just a little.
[00:22:03.934 --> 00:22:04.735]  Just a little sip.
[00:22:05.295 --> 00:22:05.595]  Open up.
[00:22:05.895 --> 00:22:06.796]  Come on, take it!
[00:22:07.296 --> 00:22:07.676]  Take it!
[00:22:08.357 --> 00:22:09.417]  I'm running for president.
[00:22:09.797 --> 00:22:12.979]  Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
[00:22:12.999 --> 00:22:17.422]  I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
[00:23:03.643 --> 00:23:09.829]  So Jonathan, you talk a little bit about, in this film, how China is setting itself up to compete with the United States.
[00:23:10.469 --> 00:23:14.673]  One of the things that you point out here is that China has observed U.S.
[00:23:14.793 --> 00:23:23.321]  actions as a superpower, so they've avoided getting involved in internal politics of the neighbors and trading partners, but a lot of countries prefer to do business with China.
[00:23:23.861 --> 00:23:27.905]  You also talk about these major institutions that are being set up by China.
[00:23:28.345 --> 00:23:32.566]  Specifically the New Silk Road, the world's largest infrastructure and trade initiative.
[00:23:32.586 --> 00:23:34.067]  So talk a little bit about that.
[00:23:34.787 --> 00:23:39.469]  So in part one of the interview, I talked about the assassination of President Roldos in Ecuador.
[00:23:39.809 --> 00:23:53.213]  I think what's really instructive is that John Perkins, the author of Confessions of an Economic Hitman, who I interview in the film, goes into detail about a meeting that he had with a very high-ranking Ecuadorian cabinet minister just last year.
[00:23:53.313 --> 00:23:55.314]  And essentially this cabinet minister told him
[00:23:55.874 --> 00:24:03.317]  That Ecuador would much prefer to do business with China because China doesn't get involved in the internal politics of any of the countries that they deal with.
[00:24:03.737 --> 00:24:09.700]  And what they do know about the United States is that A, in the past that they have gotten involved in the internal politics.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.280]  They have assassinated world leaders.
[00:24:11.641 --> 00:24:14.682]  They have been involved in countries around them.
[00:24:15.682 --> 00:24:18.623]  And maybe one day in the future, China will do these things.
[00:24:18.783 --> 00:24:21.285]  And I would make a pretty good argument that they will.
[00:24:21.765 --> 00:24:23.285]  But have they done it yet?
[00:24:23.605 --> 00:24:24.366]  And no, they haven't.
[00:24:25.266 --> 00:24:33.173]  For many countries that just don't appreciate the meddling in the United States in their internal affairs, they would much prefer to deal with a country who doesn't have that track record.
[00:24:34.314 --> 00:24:35.515]  So that's one point.
[00:24:35.595 --> 00:24:43.922]  I think the second point, there are really several different ways that China is trying to dismantle this current economic system that was set up by the United States.
[00:24:45.082 --> 00:24:50.446]  One of them, one of the biggest ways is that they set up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, or the AIIB.
[00:24:50.886 --> 00:24:56.389]  And essentially, of all the founding members, nearly every single major U.S.
[00:24:56.489 --> 00:25:03.353]  ally participated in the founding of this bank, and all of them did it against the explicit wishes of the U.S.
[00:25:03.373 --> 00:25:08.796]  government, which is incredibly fascinating to begin with, that literally countries like the U.K.
[00:25:08.836 --> 00:25:11.218]  and other countries in Europe and such ignored
[00:25:11.858 --> 00:25:13.139]  We're good to go.
[00:25:31.906 --> 00:25:49.399]  So, the AIB is ultimately going to be used to finance the world's largest infrastructure project, which is the New Silk Road, and they're going to be building ports and railways, highways, basically connect the entire massive supercontinent of Eurasia together.
[00:25:49.459 --> 00:25:53.102]  So, it binds Africa, Asia, and Europe together in this one integrated
[00:25:53.702 --> 00:25:54.362]  We're good to go.
[00:26:16.929 --> 00:26:27.376]  They can indeed choose to choose to join this other, you know, parallel system that over time, I mean, I mean, Eurasia represents, you know, what is it, four fifths of the world's population?
[00:26:27.476 --> 00:26:29.518]  I mean, this is a this is a massive deal.
[00:26:30.058 --> 00:26:32.180]  So, you know, I don't know how much you want me to get into it.
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:39.825]  I can also get into the military aspects, which I think is is China is doing something very aggressive and unique in the South China Sea right now.
[00:26:40.307 --> 00:26:49.071]  Yeah, we definitely want to hear about that, because a lot of people are seeing some aggressive maneuvers, and from where we sit, we don't really understand necessarily what's going on.
[00:26:49.372 --> 00:27:00.337]  Now again, I'm speaking with Jonathan Roth, and we are talking about the documentary that's just recently been released, China on Top, how China is using America's playbook to take over the world.
[00:27:00.737 --> 00:27:05.640]  And you can find that documentary at kcresearch.com slash China.
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.762]  So yes, let's talk about some of these military tactics that are happening.
[00:27:10.771 --> 00:27:15.152]  Sure, well essentially a few years ago China decided that they wanted to push the U.S.
[00:27:15.272 --> 00:27:16.672]  out of the South China Sea.
[00:27:17.012 --> 00:27:21.613]  Really, let's just be honest about this, China does not have a very powerful military.
[00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:33.036]  There's only one place in the world that they can really exert power and project power and that's in the South China Sea and they've decided they're going to do that because up until just recently the South China Sea has essentially been
[00:27:33.936 --> 00:27:38.198]  You know, the Americans control it and they run it because so much trade runs to that area.
[00:27:38.778 --> 00:27:48.762]  So they built up all these islands, which I'm sure many of your viewers have seen these stories on television, but what's really behind this is that China is essentially trying to push the U.S.
[00:27:49.242 --> 00:27:52.503]  military out of this area because they recognize that the U.S.
[00:27:52.583 --> 00:28:00.306]  could choke off China in the event of any sort of conflict, say China between Japan or China and Taiwan, the U.S.
[00:28:00.706 --> 00:28:01.747]  Navy could cut off
[00:28:02.267 --> 00:28:02.707]  I don't know.
[00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:30.535]  We're good to go.
[00:28:51.189 --> 00:28:57.397]  All these other countries are going to say to themselves, well what, what, you know, the Philippines has a security guarantee with the United States.
[00:28:57.517 --> 00:28:58.017]  If the U.S.
[00:28:58.057 --> 00:29:00.761]  will not stand up for the Philippines, will they stand up for us?
[00:29:01.221 --> 00:29:05.566]  And that's where this becomes extremely problematic, especially the most serious one is probably
[00:29:06.147 --> 00:29:06.527]  We're good to go.
[00:29:24.378 --> 00:29:34.647]  And I think if Hillary Clinton is elected president, this is my own take on the situation, I would argue that it's almost a guarantee that there is going to be a war in the South China Sea.
[00:29:34.747 --> 00:29:39.831]  Because the Chinese will not back down, and if Clinton is president, I don't think she will either.
[00:29:39.931 --> 00:29:45.676]  And I think you're going to have a very serious conflict that could escalate into something catastrophic very quickly.
[00:29:46.283 --> 00:29:46.903]  Absolutely.
[00:29:47.123 --> 00:30:00.148]  And I think we're all kind of just anticipating that there is going to be some sort of a World War III, but they're really ramping up the rhetoric that it's going to be Russia is really the troublemaker there, but China is really making these aggressive moves.
[00:30:00.988 --> 00:30:03.449]  And as you say, they've kind of been planning this.
[00:30:03.529 --> 00:30:11.452]  I guess just briefly with our last question here, what will we learn from the film about China's role in the next financial crisis?
[00:30:12.665 --> 00:30:16.690]  Sure, I think this is the element of the story that a lot of people don't really understand.
[00:30:17.472 --> 00:30:27.865]  Most conventional analysts who study China and China's rise believe that China will not assume the number one role economically and geopolitically for at least another 20 to 30 years.
[00:30:28.546 --> 00:30:30.229]  I would make the argument, I make it in the film,
[00:30:30.689 --> 00:30:34.852]  That indeed, that's probably the forecast may be too far out.
[00:30:35.352 --> 00:30:45.220]  And that is because the US has a massive economic crisis that is just waiting, lurking around the corner in terms of something seriously terrible happening.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.502]  And that really revolves around what happened in 2008.
[00:30:48.142 --> 00:31:03.738]  2008, they papered over the crisis, central banks around the world, but being led and told by the Fed essentially what to do, they essentially papered over this crisis and they have essentially built up this edifice that's even larger and more dangerous than it was in 2008.
[00:31:03.938 --> 00:31:05.720]  The banks are bigger than they've ever been before.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:11.764]  The more complex, you're seeing many of the same activities that were happening in 2008 only to greater degrees.
[00:31:13.185 --> 00:31:22.152]  You know, they've essentially lowered interest rates to zero and really they're below zero if you think about the rate of inflation versus what interest rates are.
[00:31:22.552 --> 00:31:25.493]  So, sooner or later this crisis is going to hit the U.S.
[00:31:25.914 --> 00:31:39.140]  and when it does, I think what that's going to do is in many ways similar to what happened in World War II with Great Britain, that really essentially, you know, utterly, you know, ended British influence around the world and they had to divest of their empire.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.161]  I think the same thing is going to happen in the United States.
[00:31:41.961 --> 00:31:47.424]  And the interesting part about it is, is that one out of every two Americans is invested in the stock market.
[00:31:48.368 --> 00:31:50.529]  In China, that number is only 1 in 30.
[00:31:51.850 --> 00:32:00.113]  So, you know, any sort of long-term exposure by Chinese citizens to this, you know, the global stock market is just not the same as what we have here.
[00:32:01.253 --> 00:32:11.838]  And when you take a look at savings rates in China versus what they are in the United States, there's a whole number of reasons to see why China will walk out of this situation in a lot better shape than the United States will.
[00:32:11.898 --> 00:32:13.679]  Now, of course, China has a lot of problems.
[00:32:13.959 --> 00:32:14.299]  A lot of them.
[00:32:14.319 --> 00:32:15.419]  There's no question about that.
[00:32:15.479 --> 00:32:16.440]  They have a lot of problems.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.002]  But China has the one thing the U.S.
[00:32:19.022 --> 00:32:20.664]  doesn't have right now, and that's confidence.
[00:32:20.884 --> 00:32:29.132]  And if you ask any Chinese citizen, if you look at the Pew, the results from the Pew research studies that they've been doing recently, I mean, China is full of confidence.
[00:32:29.172 --> 00:32:33.896]  Their citizens truly believe no matter what happens economically, even the short term, that they're going to be running the world.
[00:32:33.916 --> 00:32:34.336]  Wow.
[00:32:34.356 --> 00:32:35.838]  Americans do not feel that way.
[00:32:36.098 --> 00:32:37.841]  Yeah, no, we can definitely see that.
[00:32:38.261 --> 00:32:39.943]  Well, Jonathan Roth, thank you so much.
[00:32:40.024 --> 00:32:45.611]  And everyone, go and watch the film, China on Top, how China is using America's playbook to take over the world.
[00:32:45.731 --> 00:32:48.936]  That is at kcresearch.com slash China.
[00:32:49.196 --> 00:32:50.398]  Jonathan, thanks for joining us.
[00:32:50.478 --> 00:32:51.840]  We'll have you back on the show soon.
[00:32:52.581 --> 00:32:53.122]  Thank you very much.
[00:33:02.526 --> 00:33:08.011]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:33:08.531 --> 00:33:09.032]  Unveiled!
[00:33:09.432 --> 00:33:12.495]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[00:33:13.176 --> 00:33:13.636]  30 servings.
[00:33:13.836 --> 00:33:16.439]  Fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[00:33:16.739 --> 00:33:17.800]  It is simply amazing.
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:18.801]  Infowarslife.com
[00:33:19.201 --> 00:33:23.603]  There's a million different products like this out there that they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.123 --> 00:33:37.228]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all the essential amino acids, all the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.628 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.828 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are going to take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.401 --> 00:34:01.363]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here, okay?
[00:34:01.383 --> 00:34:03.464]  Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.484 --> 00:34:05.346]  But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.746]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com, they're excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.467 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.188]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:49.088]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:59.510]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine, each one of these you could go on for about ten minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.151]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.191 --> 00:35:04.691]  Thirty-four other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.532]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:17.357]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just... By the way, look on the other side too, because we're showing people the minerals and things.
[00:35:17.397 --> 00:35:19.259]  Let's look at the vitamins right there, Old Scott, in there.
[00:35:19.279 --> 00:35:19.959]  I mean, it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again, if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.648 --> 00:35:38.048]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.128 --> 00:35:40.289]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.529 --> 00:35:41.109]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.149 --> 00:35:48.172]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.472 --> 00:35:53.994]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.514 --> 00:35:55.335]  So get them today!

[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.981]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:36:02.362 --> 00:36:08.287]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.199]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.481]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.689]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.029 --> 00:36:46.693]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:36:46.873 --> 00:36:53.017]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.

[00:37:05.459 --> 00:37:06.159]  Intruder alert!
[00:37:06.459 --> 00:37:08.020]  Evacuate bridge.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:13.461]  Head for a life support failure in 10 seconds.
[00:37:13.521 --> 00:37:17.622]  This is an emergency transmission.
[00:37:18.722 --> 00:37:22.683]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:37:22.703 --> 00:37:28.565]  These people are coming for everybody!
[00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:35.865]  A troubling report has surfaced involving Mexican immigration authorities.
[00:37:36.366 --> 00:37:43.011]  424 North African migrants were given Mexican visas and are heading for the U.S.-Mexico border, where they plan on requesting asylum.
[00:37:43.211 --> 00:37:47.134]  The migrants arrived in the southern state of Chiapas over a two-day span last week.
[00:37:47.154 --> 00:37:48.555]  They were given transit visas.
[00:37:48.795 --> 00:37:57.061]  Mexican officials are calling the surge unusual, but say most migrants first travel through Brazil or Ecuador to start their journey through Latin America, heading for North America.
[00:37:57.321 --> 00:38:11.348]  Most of the Africans present themselves voluntarily to Mexican immigration officials, and what we do know is that Mexico's National Immigration Institute has issued them 20-day transit visas to allow them to migrate, reaching the U.S.-Mexican border, where they can enter freely.
[00:38:11.548 --> 00:38:15.730]  We know that they're coming from the Congo, Somalia, and Ghana, and that they will arrive in the U.S.
[00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:17.491]  port entry of San Cicero.
[00:38:17.631 --> 00:38:24.615]  The temporary visas allow entry, and oftentimes the migrant can assimilate freely without difficulty, unchecked, unvetted, and not monitored.
[00:38:24.775 --> 00:38:28.196]  Well, this then set a precedent for thousands more to take advantage of our system.
[00:38:28.376 --> 00:38:30.837]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:38:36.578 --> 00:38:38.759]  Alex Jones here with huge breaking news.
[00:38:39.099 --> 00:38:45.601]  Hillary Clinton, in her own words, in FBI testimony released today, told the FBI that she had amnesia.
[00:38:45.901 --> 00:38:48.602]  Didn't remember the emails, the servers, any of it.
[00:38:49.382 --> 00:38:52.963]  In her own words, she says, she is unfit to be president.
[00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:15.317]  These things are predictable, but it's still hard to believe that the FBI has been pressured for months to release their research data dump on Hillary Clinton, because even if they're going to roll over and not charge her for the crimes she's publicly committed, they should at least release them.
[00:39:15.557 --> 00:39:20.299]  So now, with Labor Day coming up and having this holiday on Friday,
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:25.508]  They predictably released the data dump at 1 p.m.
[00:39:26.109 --> 00:39:27.651]  Central Standard Time.
[00:39:28.172 --> 00:39:34.063]  Knowing that Americans are busy going to pick their kids up after school and to get ready for the long three-day weekend.
[00:39:35.188 --> 00:39:39.090]  A lot of what's in the data dump we've already seen, but tons of it is new.
[00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:44.853]  We knew about 33,000 emails that she never turned over that disappeared.
[00:39:45.253 --> 00:39:46.153]  That was already admitted.
[00:39:46.634 --> 00:39:57.179]  Now they admit to 17,500 emails that they said weren't there, that they'd previously denied to give over, that were on the servers.
[00:39:57.839 --> 00:40:03.288]  So they basically gave the FBI this needle in a haystack and hoped they wouldn't notice that a lot of it was hiding in plain view.
[00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:06.053]  But here's the big news from the FBI.
[00:40:06.774 --> 00:40:08.958]  And it's on screen for TV viewers.
[00:40:10.801 --> 00:40:11.643]  Hillary Clinton
[00:40:13.243 --> 00:40:21.307]  Over and over and over again, dodged subpoenas, wouldn't testify to Congress, wouldn't talk to the FBI, wouldn't answer their questions.
[00:40:21.627 --> 00:40:24.749]  And it was even in the news at the time in 2013, where is she?
[00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:26.290]  She's in the hospital for almost a year.
[00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:41.818]  Well now, the FBI has gone public and said that Hillary Clinton told them years ago, and then again recently, that because she had a traumatic brain injury, a concussion, she had amnesia and didn't remember.
[00:40:42.563 --> 00:40:48.645]  This is so huge because this is what Matt Drudge for three years has been saying.
[00:40:48.685 --> 00:40:51.806]  It's what Obama's former doctor is saying.
[00:40:51.846 --> 00:40:53.866]  It's what Dr. Drew got fired for saying.
[00:40:53.906 --> 00:40:56.987]  It's what my guests like Dr. Steve Pachinick have been saying.
[00:40:57.427 --> 00:40:59.728]  Hillary Clinton clearly has neurological problems.
[00:41:00.568 --> 00:41:03.409]  Donald Trump comes out and says she's having to take naps all the time.
[00:41:03.809 --> 00:41:05.249]  She only gives a few speeches a week.
[00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:06.190]  She's low energy.
[00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:08.070]  This is not presidential material.
[00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:10.391]  WikiLeaks shows that she was trying to get
[00:41:12.355 --> 00:41:13.776]  Drugs for Parkinson's?
[00:41:14.756 --> 00:41:15.737]  It goes on and on.
[00:41:15.817 --> 00:41:17.798]  The weird seizure-like behavior.
[00:41:17.818 --> 00:41:19.799]  They're being helped up by Secret Service.
[00:41:20.299 --> 00:41:25.542]  Her doctor coming over with a tranquilizer pen saying, it's okay, it's okay when somebody yells something in the crowd.
[00:41:25.882 --> 00:41:31.045]  This woman is clearly a basket case a lot of the time and is having serious problems.
[00:41:31.665 --> 00:41:38.749]  And the word is she had brain surgery multiple times during that year in the hospital that overlapped 2012-2013.
[00:41:38.769 --> 00:41:41.130]  They've not released her full medical records.
[00:41:41.769 --> 00:41:45.152]  They've released only a snippet from an earlier doctor in New York.
[00:41:45.172 --> 00:41:57.345]  So this is such a big deal that Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump, not Alex Jones, not Matt Drudge, not Breitbart, not WorldNetDaily, not Vladimir Putin, not the Keebler elves,
[00:41:58.609 --> 00:42:01.331]  Because we're all told this is a theory from Vladimir Putin and we're all getting orders.
[00:42:01.591 --> 00:42:01.952]  Hold on.
[00:42:02.192 --> 00:42:02.952]  Putin, what do I say?
[00:42:03.032 --> 00:42:03.913]  Okay, I'll say it right now.
[00:42:04.414 --> 00:42:25.590]  No, you look like hell, you've been in the hospital, you're falling down, you've got all these problems, you're in the hospital for a year, and now you, Hillary Clinton, told the FBI that you couldn't remember anything you did because you had such a serious brain injury.
[00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:26.671]  You need to be a
[00:42:28.049 --> 00:42:28.470]  I think?
[00:42:46.912 --> 00:42:52.916]  And you need to be held accountable for being caught having classified material on your servers you lied about.
[00:42:53.136 --> 00:42:55.378]  The FBI has come out now and released the evidence.
[00:42:55.738 --> 00:43:00.381]  The FBI's Hillary email probe found evidence of effort to evade federal records law.
[00:43:01.001 --> 00:43:07.406]  That's what made the head of the EPA have to step down three years ago was having a fake set of records as well.
[00:43:07.726 --> 00:43:09.167]  You have absconded from the law.
[00:43:09.547 --> 00:43:10.328]  You've been caught.
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:17.283]  And it's time for the crime syndicate you represent, the Bush and Clinton crime family, to ride into the sunset.
[00:43:18.423 --> 00:43:26.287]  If you don't, it's pretty clear that your health's going to catch up with you, the law's going to catch up with you, and public opinion has already caught up with you.
[00:43:26.507 --> 00:43:27.727]  You've been caught red-handed.
[00:43:28.147 --> 00:43:30.628]  More stories and analysis at InfoWars.com.
[00:43:30.989 --> 00:43:33.690]  If you're watching or listening to this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:43:44.656 --> 00:43:50.162]  You know, Australia's a good example, Canada's a good example, the UK is a good example.
[00:43:50.222 --> 00:43:50.523]  Why?
[00:43:51.684 --> 00:43:53.546]  Because each of them had mass killings.
[00:43:54.027 --> 00:43:59.152]  Somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue.
[00:44:00.017 --> 00:44:02.538]  Well, this is something we should politicize.
[00:44:03.218 --> 00:44:04.058]  I'm not going to carry a gun.
[00:44:04.139 --> 00:44:05.899]  I don't want to be involved in a gunfight.
[00:44:05.999 --> 00:44:18.664]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:44:24.066 --> 00:44:24.506]  Go ahead.
[00:44:25.632 --> 00:44:26.573]  Make my day.
[00:44:27.133 --> 00:44:31.055]  So the notion that gun laws don't work, it's not borne out by the evidence.
[00:44:31.495 --> 00:44:36.937]  He says that the Chicago police had a plan over this bloody 4th of July weekend.
[00:44:37.317 --> 00:44:45.781]  Nonetheless, as you indicated, Corey, there was a count of casualties that could have been from Afghanistan or Iraq.
[00:44:46.122 --> 00:44:46.602]  We'll make it.
[00:44:47.855 --> 00:44:50.737]  Harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns.
[00:44:51.178 --> 00:44:58.363]  In many cases the offenders, felons, some out on parole, some out on bond.
[00:44:58.703 --> 00:45:05.668]  We have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.
[00:45:05.848 --> 00:45:09.290]  There are people at high levels in this government who have
[00:45:10.331 --> 00:45:10.973]  Bodyguards.
[00:45:12.014 --> 00:45:13.938]  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[00:45:14.299 --> 00:45:16.342]  The average American does not have that.
[00:45:16.683 --> 00:45:20.550]  Mayor Bloomberg, why can you defend yourself but not...
[00:45:21.411 --> 00:45:22.491]  The majority of Americans.
[00:45:22.531 --> 00:45:24.652]  I mean, look at the team of security you've got!
[00:45:25.052 --> 00:45:27.393]  Every day, every school, at every level.
[00:45:27.873 --> 00:45:33.614]  One thing that I think is clear with young people, and with adults as well, is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:45:33.674 --> 00:45:40.636]  And we need to do this every day of the week, and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:45:41.056 --> 00:45:44.638]  Was this the weapon of choice for a new kind of terrorist?
[00:45:44.978 --> 00:45:52.543]  When a five-year-old girl said she and a classmate should shoot each other with bubbles, the school calls it a terrorist threat.
[00:45:52.963 --> 00:45:56.065]  AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:45:56.965 --> 00:46:00.947]  You know, the right to bear arms is because that's the last form of defense against tyranny.
[00:46:01.428 --> 00:46:03.429]  Lay down your arms, you damned rebels!
[00:46:05.131 --> 00:46:09.014]  But we don't need the ability to arm ourselves against the army or the police.
[00:46:09.294 --> 00:46:11.096]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[00:46:11.136 --> 00:46:12.117]  would you see that happening?
[00:46:12.177 --> 00:46:16.240]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:21.924]  ...discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[00:46:22.305 --> 00:46:27.489]  To say, we're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down.
[00:46:27.809 --> 00:46:29.931]  If you want them, come and take them!
[00:46:30.575 --> 00:46:35.028]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:37.074]  It's Alex Jones!

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.021]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.146]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.566 --> 00:47:48.329]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.449 --> 00:47:50.491]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.071 --> 00:47:52.592]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.652 --> 00:48:00.577]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.898 --> 00:48:08.203]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.563 --> 00:48:15.688]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:24.635]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.655 --> 00:48:28.958]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.318 --> 00:48:38.762]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:48:39.162 --> 00:48:42.243]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:42.583 --> 00:48:53.588]  Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:48:53.848 --> 00:48:56.352]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[00:48:56.592 --> 00:48:59.556]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[00:48:59.696 --> 00:49:02.580]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[00:49:20.847 --> 00:49:23.788]  We're out here with some Trump protesters.
[00:49:23.948 --> 00:49:24.648]  What's your name ma'am?
[00:49:24.968 --> 00:49:26.229]  Hi, my name is Georgia Schmitz.
[00:49:26.709 --> 00:49:27.949]  And what are you out here protesting?
[00:49:28.129 --> 00:49:29.410]  I'm protesting Donald Trump.
[00:49:30.276 --> 00:49:33.818]  And what is it about Donald Trump that motivated you to come out here and protest?
[00:49:34.198 --> 00:49:37.480]  Well, I think he's s**t and his running mate Mike Pence is a s**t as well.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:38.781]  He's a racist.
[00:49:38.941 --> 00:49:41.782]  I'm protesting because I think Donald Trump is a racist.
[00:49:42.223 --> 00:49:45.444]  I think he would be the worst president in the history of our country.
[00:49:46.085 --> 00:49:48.406]  I painted my face because I think that Trump is a joke.
[00:49:48.886 --> 00:49:54.589]  Because he is racist, misogynistic, he hates immigrants and yet he has an immigrant as a wife.
[00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:57.991]  As I just said to her, let's look for something beyond an ad hominem attack.
[00:49:58.031 --> 00:49:58.972]  Let's talk about policy.
[00:49:59.312 --> 00:50:01.433]  Okay, he doesn't really have any policy.
[00:50:01.493 --> 00:50:03.074]  Well, that's completely false, actually.
[00:50:03.114 --> 00:50:03.614]  Now, hold on.
[00:50:03.654 --> 00:50:05.475]  See, this is an amazing argument.
[00:50:05.515 --> 00:50:07.696]  I see people saying that Donald Trump has no policy.
[00:50:07.957 --> 00:50:12.699]  Donald Trump has given more detailed policy plans than any other candidate.
[00:50:12.939 --> 00:50:15.280]  Tax reform, health care, school.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.001]  He's done it all.
[00:50:16.041 --> 00:50:16.601]  Immigration.
[00:50:16.981 --> 00:50:19.202]  No other candidate has had a detailed plan like this.
[00:50:20.743 --> 00:50:21.143]  A joke.
[00:50:21.404 --> 00:50:23.205]  They continue to go to ad hominem attacks.
[00:50:23.465 --> 00:50:24.626]  So what else is wrong with Trump?
[00:50:25.046 --> 00:50:25.806]  I think G.G.
[00:50:25.966 --> 00:50:27.928]  Allen should be the President of the United States.
[00:50:28.228 --> 00:50:29.169]  I think we should all die.
[00:50:29.909 --> 00:50:30.810]  This is a protest.
[00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:31.990]  Hey, do you have anything to say?
[00:50:34.212 --> 00:50:37.554]  I think he's saying a lot right now, man.
[00:50:37.674 --> 00:50:39.555]  I think he's saying a lot.
[00:50:39.635 --> 00:50:40.596]  He said nothing.
[00:50:40.796 --> 00:50:42.357]  Do you have anything to say at all?
[00:50:45.112 --> 00:50:48.354]  I think that immigration is a human right and that we should get rid of all borders.
[00:50:48.674 --> 00:50:51.715]  Now we've got some, it looks like some communists gathered behind me.
[00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:53.316]  We're gonna see what they're here doing.
[00:50:54.196 --> 00:50:56.157]  You guys are against Trump, you mind telling us why?
[00:50:57.418 --> 00:50:58.818]  This guy doesn't, why can't he talk to them?
[00:50:59.158 --> 00:51:00.239]  You don't like his right to free speech?
[00:51:02.374 --> 00:51:04.976]  That's why they don't want to talk to us because that's all they can say.
[00:51:05.597 --> 00:51:07.918]  See, see?
[00:51:08.619 --> 00:51:14.123]  Every single one of them has used F. Why are you trying to fight me, bro?
[00:51:14.503 --> 00:51:19.827]  Hey, hey, what are you saying?
[00:51:19.848 --> 00:51:20.568]  What are you guys chanting?
[00:51:20.588 --> 00:51:21.108]  What does that mean?
[00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:22.530]  Anti-capitalist.
[00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:24.131]  You're anti-capitalism.
[00:51:25.213 --> 00:51:26.915]  So why don't you go to a communist country?
[00:51:27.856 --> 00:51:29.778]  We're trying to make this one a communist country.
[00:51:29.819 --> 00:51:30.660]  Wait, wait, wait.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.402]  Hey, do you know about Venezuela?
[00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:34.371]  Never heard of it.
[00:51:34.451 --> 00:51:35.451]  Never heard of Venezuela.
[00:51:35.471 --> 00:51:37.953]  Venezuela is a communist country that is collapsing.
[00:51:37.973 --> 00:51:38.833]  They're eating their pets.
[00:51:38.873 --> 00:51:39.393]  They're so hungry.
[00:51:39.413 --> 00:51:40.414]  What do you think about that?
[00:51:40.434 --> 00:51:40.934]  Fucking idiot!
[00:51:40.954 --> 00:51:42.675]  You wouldn't know communism if it punched you in the face!
[00:51:42.695 --> 00:51:44.016]  What do you think about Venezuela?
[00:51:44.376 --> 00:51:46.397]  Like it did Alex Jones last f***ing year!
[00:51:46.417 --> 00:51:47.658]  What do you think about Venezuela?
[00:51:47.758 --> 00:51:51.360]  Alex Jones went after Austin!
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:51.880]  Hey, hey.
[00:51:52.021 --> 00:51:53.221]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:51:53.962 --> 00:51:55.302]  What do you think about Venezuela?
[00:51:55.563 --> 00:51:58.504]  I think you're a f***ing boy and you don't know what communism means.
[00:51:58.584 --> 00:51:59.245]  Alex Jones!
[00:51:59.265 --> 00:52:00.025]  Alex Jones!
[00:52:00.045 --> 00:52:00.766]  Alex Jones!
[00:52:00.946 --> 00:52:01.326]  Alex Jones!
[00:52:01.546 --> 00:52:02.366]  Alex Jones!
[00:52:02.667 --> 00:52:03.247]  Alex Jones!
[00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:07.753]  They want Alex Jones out of Austin.
[00:52:09.576 --> 00:52:11.018]  They want Infowars out of Austin.
[00:52:11.378 --> 00:52:12.500]  These people hate free speech.
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:13.942]  They're obviously communists.
[00:52:13.962 --> 00:52:17.046]  So I don't know why they just don't go to Venezuela, a communist haven.
[00:52:17.406 --> 00:52:19.469]  Hey, you guys know North Korea is communist too.
[00:52:19.509 --> 00:52:20.351]  Why don't you go to North Korea?
[00:52:22.421 --> 00:52:22.682]  You!
[00:52:23.022 --> 00:52:23.964]  Can you put your sign down?
[00:52:24.645 --> 00:52:28.351]  You're out here... I don't understand people that... I'm not in your face.
[00:52:28.391 --> 00:52:28.912]  Calm down.
[00:52:28.932 --> 00:52:33.420]  I just don't understand people that come out here and protest, and then... Oh, look at that.
[00:52:35.945 --> 00:52:38.586]  I just became an official Hillary Clinton supporter.
[00:52:38.826 --> 00:52:41.606]  Senior citizens, look at Donald Trump.
[00:52:41.926 --> 00:52:45.747]  He's a filthy, lying... I don't think you speak for all senior citizens.
[00:52:46.427 --> 00:52:47.587]  Are you out of your mind?
[00:52:47.627 --> 00:52:49.008]  My grandparents support Donald Trump.
[00:52:49.048 --> 00:52:50.948]  I don't give a **** about your grandparents.
[00:52:50.968 --> 00:52:51.388]  That's clear.
[00:52:51.408 --> 00:52:53.909]  What I know about are the people that I know.
[00:52:54.269 --> 00:52:58.550]  I'm a senior citizen and I don't believe in dirty, filthy, lying politics.
[00:52:58.650 --> 00:52:59.910]  Okay, so who are you going to vote for?
[00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:00.930]  Can I ask you who you're going to vote for?
[00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:02.171]  You can count on it.
[00:53:02.231 --> 00:53:04.072]  I'm voting for Hillary Clinton.
[00:53:04.092 --> 00:53:04.672]  Hold on, folks.
[00:53:04.692 --> 00:53:08.574]  She just said she's against lying corrupt politicians, but she's voting for Hillary Clinton.
[00:53:08.874 --> 00:53:13.176]  You would think if you're out here protesting, there is something driving you to do that.
[00:53:13.217 --> 00:53:14.597]  There's a motivational factor.
[00:53:14.997 --> 00:53:20.300]  And then, when I give them a platform to talk about their issues, they completely ignore me.
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:21.081]  I get balloons.
[00:53:21.841 --> 00:53:22.662]  This is a clown.
[00:53:22.922 --> 00:53:23.942]  Yeah, I do actually.
[00:53:24.102 --> 00:53:25.263]  Do you have a clown degree?
[00:53:25.283 --> 00:53:26.283]  Did you go to clown school?
[00:53:26.363 --> 00:53:26.684]  I do.
[00:53:26.764 --> 00:53:27.884]  Hey, that's official.
[00:53:27.964 --> 00:53:29.445]  So are you clowns against Trump?
[00:53:29.805 --> 00:53:30.726]  Yeah, yeah, we are.
[00:53:31.486 --> 00:53:34.848]  We hate free speech, so we're out here protesting.
[00:53:34.868 --> 00:53:36.709]  Well, you don't want Alex Jones right to free speech.
[00:53:36.729 --> 00:53:38.630]  I don't even know who the f*** Alex Jones is.
[00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:41.031]  You were just chanting Alex Jones out of Austin.
[00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:42.091]  Yeah, I know what I was saying.
[00:53:42.132 --> 00:53:42.992]  I'm not stupid.
[00:53:43.132 --> 00:53:44.773]  So you say things you know nothing about?
[00:53:44.813 --> 00:53:45.593]  Yeah, that's me.
[00:53:45.613 --> 00:53:46.434]  So like communism?
[00:53:47.194 --> 00:53:48.135]  Well, I'm Russian.
[00:53:48.195 --> 00:53:49.396]  I know plenty about that.
[00:53:49.416 --> 00:53:51.377]  So you should know why communism is bad.
[00:53:51.397 --> 00:53:53.218]  Yeah, I do know why communism is bad.
[00:53:53.238 --> 00:53:55.160]  So why are you out here protesting capitalism?
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:57.041]  Why are you out here interrogating me?
[00:53:57.061 --> 00:54:02.465]  The reason why we come out here and do these videos is because these people embarrass themselves.
[00:54:02.765 --> 00:54:06.888]  People go watch these videos and then they see how stupid the anti-Trump movement is.
[00:54:06.908 --> 00:54:07.388]  That's the truth.
[00:54:07.428 --> 00:54:08.649]  That's why we do these videos.
[00:54:08.689 --> 00:54:12.692]  You think I want to be out here in the 95 degree heat sweating like this?
[00:54:13.173 --> 00:54:13.433]  No!
[00:54:13.493 --> 00:54:19.217]  But we come out here and we destroy the anti-Trump movement because these people are the most ignorant people I've ever met in my life.
[00:54:19.617 --> 00:54:24.321]  Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com Stupid questions, intelligent answers.
[00:54:24.721 --> 00:54:26.762]  Donald Trump is a tramp.
[00:54:27.102 --> 00:54:28.744]  We are still
[00:54:30.858 --> 00:54:32.919]  Probably at least a quarter of a mile away from the Trump rally.
[00:54:33.559 --> 00:54:34.699]  And traffic is backing up.
[00:54:34.779 --> 00:54:35.699]  It's a near standstill.
[00:54:35.719 --> 00:54:38.280]  People have started to get out of their cars and walk.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:43.881]  I am inviting anyone here!
[00:54:44.401 --> 00:54:45.441]  The microphone!
[00:54:45.821 --> 00:54:47.442]  Come tell me why you hate Trump!
[00:54:47.582 --> 00:54:48.662]  Shut the f**k up!
[00:54:48.822 --> 00:54:50.362]  Because I have a vagina!
[00:54:50.542 --> 00:54:52.243]  Because Trump ain't for the people!
[00:54:52.343 --> 00:54:53.223]  He's racist, n***a!
[00:54:53.243 --> 00:54:55.543]  Because he's a piece of s**t!
[00:54:55.683 --> 00:54:56.884]  What's your point, ma'am?
[00:54:56.924 --> 00:54:58.804]  What's your point, ma'am?
[00:55:00.506 --> 00:55:01.187]  What's your point, man?
[00:55:01.567 --> 00:55:02.588]  What's your point, Cowbell?
[00:55:04.149 --> 00:55:06.571]  Can I ask who you support for president in the upcoming election?
[00:55:06.851 --> 00:55:07.552]  Hillary Clinton.
[00:55:08.152 --> 00:55:09.373]  You don't think Hillary Clinton lies?
[00:55:10.014 --> 00:55:10.634]  Well, you know what?
[00:55:10.654 --> 00:55:12.356]  She has more experience than Trump does.
[00:55:12.796 --> 00:55:13.917]  And what experience is that?
[00:55:14.758 --> 00:55:16.840]  This is a pro-Trump TV station.
[00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:17.420]  Oh, is it?
[00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:18.321]  Oh, well there you go.
[00:55:18.501 --> 00:55:19.001]  So what?
[00:55:19.061 --> 00:55:20.082]  So you're bigoted against me?
[00:55:20.783 --> 00:55:21.584]  I'm not bigoted.
[00:55:21.684 --> 00:55:23.385]  Well then why'd you come say that to cut her off?
[00:55:23.625 --> 00:55:24.966]  Because you're a pro-Trump-er.
[00:55:25.327 --> 00:55:26.768]  Okay, you're probably a pro-Hillary-er.
[00:55:27.893 --> 00:55:28.774]  You're a pro-Trump-er.
[00:55:29.194 --> 00:55:29.955]  You're really educated.
[00:55:29.975 --> 00:55:30.516]  Go ahead, ma'am.
[00:55:33.278 --> 00:55:33.639]  Okay!
[00:55:34.079 --> 00:55:35.200]  So, there we go.
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:37.302]  Thank you for your time, though.
[00:55:37.443 --> 00:55:37.663]  Woo!
[00:55:37.723 --> 00:55:38.203]  Great response!
[00:55:38.223 --> 00:55:38.644]  Great response!
[00:55:39.725 --> 00:55:41.266]  So, look at this, guys.
[00:55:41.286 --> 00:55:44.910]  Somebody stuck a knife in this guy's tire at the Trump Rally.
[00:55:45.651 --> 00:55:46.331]  Right outside Trump Rally.
[00:55:46.352 --> 00:55:48.293]  You want to say something?
[00:55:48.313 --> 00:55:49.194]  Well, we've seen...
[00:55:50.339 --> 00:55:55.001]  We've got cases of Trump supporters getting their tires slashed, getting beat up and everything.
[00:55:55.601 --> 00:55:58.382]  And that's all we can assume that happened right here.
[00:55:58.422 --> 00:56:02.024]  I don't know why else a pocket knife would be sticking out of a tire.
[00:56:02.724 --> 00:56:07.166]  Unfortunately for this person, he was victimized by the peaceful Trump protesters this evening.
[00:56:23.203 --> 00:56:25.644]  They said in October I'd be dead in six months.
[00:56:27.585 --> 00:56:37.791]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones, who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[00:56:39.052 --> 00:56:49.918]  He even said, and this really just is so disgusting, he even said the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors
[00:56:50.805 --> 00:56:53.486]  And no one was actually killed there.
[00:56:53.606 --> 00:57:03.450]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[00:57:04.530 --> 00:57:06.771]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[00:57:07.211 --> 00:57:12.153]  He actually went on Jones's show and said, your reputation is amazing.
[00:57:12.253 --> 00:57:13.534]  I will not let you down.
[00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:31.036]  Now we are introducing a new t-shirt, which I think folks need to get, telling the real truth about Bill Clinton, who is a serial rapist and a user of women.
[00:57:31.156 --> 00:57:34.939]  In another case, it's about groping and fondling and touching against a woman's will.
[00:57:35.119 --> 00:57:35.459]  And rape.
[00:57:35.639 --> 00:57:36.039]  And rape.
[00:57:36.099 --> 00:57:40.262]  Bill rapes them physically, and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[00:57:40.322 --> 00:57:40.962]  He's a rapist.
[00:57:41.523 --> 00:57:41.943]  Absolutely.
[00:57:41.963 --> 00:57:43.224]  He's a public figure, he goes straight to hell.
[00:57:43.404 --> 00:57:48.787]  Get your Bill Clinton rape shirt today at Infowarsstore.com or call 1-800-253-3139.
[00:57:48.987 --> 00:58:01.093]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:58:01.553 --> 00:58:03.254]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:58:03.454 --> 00:58:04.014]  Think about it.
[00:58:04.214 --> 00:58:09.997]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:58:10.257 --> 00:58:11.158]  But on the other hand,
[00:58:11.598 --> 00:58:15.840]  The Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:27.967]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:58:28.247 --> 00:58:31.008]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:58:31.188 --> 00:58:33.670]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:38.452]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:58:38.893 --> 00:58:39.453]  Think about it.
[00:58:39.653 --> 00:58:50.838]  This is Darren McBreen and I want you to break the matrix at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and listen to the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on in your mind.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.932]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.393 --> 00:59:20.121]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.441 --> 00:59:24.145]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.725 --> 00:59:29.386]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.786 --> 00:59:36.007]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.308 --> 00:59:38.608]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:39.268 --> 00:59:41.709]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:59:42.089 --> 00:59:47.590]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the InfoWar.
[00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:54.701]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
