[00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:17.461]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:17.842 --> 00:00:20.128]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:24.272 --> 00:00:28.355]  Well, it's the big New York primary day, and a whole bunch of other states as well.
[00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:30.556]  We'll be breaking it down here over the next four hours.
[00:00:30.576 --> 00:00:36.500]  Then tonight, we'll have extended live coverage kicking off at 7 o'clock Central, InfoWarsNews.com.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.464]  And we'll have free video feeds for everybody at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:00:41.824 --> 00:00:48.228]  I'll be telling you about that throughout the broadcast and sending you the links via InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:00:48.668 --> 00:00:53.952]  If you've signed up for free newsletters, we can send you news alerts and other key intel.
[00:00:54.573 --> 00:00:58.558]  Wow, we've got another big broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:09.414]  Billy Corgan, patriot, anti-New World Order crusader, and of course a guy that sold 40 million albums, the creator of Smashing Pumpkins and so many other
[00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:18.497]  Mega-hit bands will be joining us in studio today, and he's playing here tonight in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:20.398]  Billy Corgan will be in studio.
[00:01:20.438 --> 00:01:24.961]  Leon McAdoo just split five minutes ago to go pick him up downtown.
[00:01:25.682 --> 00:01:26.543]  He's a fan of Billy.
[00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:27.323]  He's a fan of her.
[00:01:27.383 --> 00:01:28.724]  He's a fan of the whole operation.
[00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:33.968]  And so I look for her to also be interviewing him for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:34.088 --> 00:01:34.609]  And who knows?
[00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.270]  Maybe more in the future.
[00:01:37.378 --> 00:01:37.959]  Maybe more.
[00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.043]  So we've got all of that to be breaking down today.
[00:01:42.724 --> 00:01:49.711]  And we have Dr. Andrew Wakefield, the vindicated hero, in studio.
[00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:53.135]  Of course, Robert De Niro saw the film.
[00:01:54.406 --> 00:02:01.729]  Vaxxed that was produced and shot in this building, to a certain extent, here in Austin, Texas, in the M4 Studios.
[00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:07.611]  I'm not behind it, I'm not a producer of it, but I let them use some of the equipment in the studios, because I believe in the cause of exposing it.
[00:02:08.732 --> 00:02:16.655]  And the federal government came, a quote, high government official came and threatened Robert De Niro at his Tribeca Film Festival that he founded, I don't know, was it 16 years ago?
[00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:20.917]  And they canceled it, but De Niro has come out and said everyone should see the film.
[00:02:22.031 --> 00:02:41.765]  And so Dr. Wakefield will give us all the inside baseball, but it turns out that when they said he was discredited and lied about it, in that big hoax a decade ago, that they knew of two studies in England, previously done by the government that were secret, that had the exact same findings as Dr. Wakefield, who is a pioneer.
[00:02:42.898 --> 00:02:52.581]  And then, of course, it was in the New York Times and all over the news the last few months that gut flora connected to toxic brain syndrome connected to autism.
[00:02:54.262 --> 00:02:55.742]  And, oh, what did Wakefield find?
[00:02:55.942 --> 00:03:08.366]  Measles, mumps, rubella antibodies for one or all three, one, two, or three, sometimes all of them, in the gut connected to a chain reaction die-off of flora.
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.441]  And a toxic brew in your gut.
[00:03:11.461 --> 00:03:12.802]  That's why you drink beer to get drunk, folks.
[00:03:12.822 --> 00:03:14.723]  That's why if you haven't eaten, you get a headache.
[00:03:14.963 --> 00:03:16.684]  Your brain and stomach are connected.
[00:03:17.304 --> 00:03:18.585]  That's why your brain follows your gut.
[00:03:18.605 --> 00:03:20.766]  It says, my gut doesn't like the way this feels.
[00:03:21.746 --> 00:03:27.910]  Because you've got brain ganglia, nerve endings, all down in your spine and in your gut.
[00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.072]  Just like a brachiosaur had a big brain in its head, another brain in its back.
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.223]  Now scientists think it has as many as five brains.
[00:03:36.824 --> 00:03:40.649]  Well, mammals have got all sorts of upper brain
[00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.971]  Cerebral cortex right down into the lower brain, right down through the spine.
[00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:51.032]  But I'm digressing.
[00:03:51.332 --> 00:04:04.016]  He's going to be joining us today to break it all down because they've now officially vindicated his scientist partner and now he is in the process of having the courts admit he was wronged and set up and he is suing people.
[00:04:04.396 --> 00:04:07.737]  So it's a long, hard fight, but we will expose the vaccines.
[00:04:07.777 --> 00:04:09.638]  I mean, it's come out, ABC News.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.502]  Fourteen years ago, there was a secret meeting in 2000.
[00:04:13.622 --> 00:04:14.863]  It came out in 2002.
[00:04:14.903 --> 00:04:27.173]  There was a secret meeting in 2000 at the Centers for Disease Control, and they have the minutes of it where the head of the CDC and all the scientists are going, I'm not giving my grandkids this now.
[00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:28.614]  We've got millions damaged.
[00:04:28.914 --> 00:04:30.956]  This is going to be a rebellion on our hands.
[00:04:30.996 --> 00:04:32.177]  We've got to cover this up.
[00:04:33.493 --> 00:04:41.515]  And I guess to their credit, they at least say we've got to somehow reach out to the vaccine makers who've got liability protection and say, look, you've got to clean this up.
[00:04:42.056 --> 00:04:44.636]  This is a public health disaster.
[00:04:45.777 --> 00:04:47.077]  But of course, it didn't get cleaned up.
[00:04:47.137 --> 00:04:49.738]  It's worse because it's by design.
[00:04:50.178 --> 00:04:52.959]  The CDC people don't know that, but it is.
[00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:55.602]  Deadly immunity.
[00:04:55.622 --> 00:04:57.925]  Government cover-up of Mercury Autism scandal.
[00:04:58.005 --> 00:04:58.907]  ABC News.
[00:04:59.568 --> 00:05:02.412]  Alright, we're going to be back, ladies and gentlemen, straight ahead.
[00:05:02.432 --> 00:05:06.017]  I told you a few days ago Donald Trump would be doubling down on 9-11 Truth.
[00:05:06.537 --> 00:05:07.058]  He did it.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.042]  He did it today, this morning on Fox.
[00:05:11.317 --> 00:05:20.319]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:28.641]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:05:28.802 --> 00:05:33.503]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:05:33.703 --> 00:05:37.344]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[00:05:38.564 --> 00:05:39.364]  We're good to go.
[00:06:02.418 --> 00:06:05.639]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:11.920]  You probably notice I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:06:25.103 --> 00:06:28.364]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:06:28.384 --> 00:06:29.564]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[00:06:29.864 --> 00:06:36.266]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of energy compounds that are gonna fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:06:36.506 --> 00:06:37.306]  This is sustainable.
[00:06:37.446 --> 00:06:41.427]  This isn't going to spike and you're gonna collapse and you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:06:41.627 --> 00:06:44.548]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:06:44.648 --> 00:06:47.891]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:49.433]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:06:49.453 --> 00:06:55.178]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.

[00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.831]  You can't survive without it.
[00:07:14.011 --> 00:07:14.931]  But where do you get it?

[00:08:21.613 --> 00:08:25.782]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:08:26.503 --> 00:08:27.966]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:08:52.216 --> 00:08:54.678]  Billy Corgan is going to be dropping some major truth bombs.
[00:08:55.439 --> 00:08:56.319]  I talked to him last night.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:08.289]  He said that he wants to really just keep putting the message out that folks need to realize that many of them are in a trance and it's time to break the trance and start really living.
[00:09:08.309 --> 00:09:12.753]  So we're going to be talking about social justice warriors a lot more.
[00:09:12.773 --> 00:09:19.278]  Some of the things he's doing with Smashing Pumpkins but also other bands that he's created and where he sees the world going.
[00:09:19.298 --> 00:09:20.199]  A really smart guy.
[00:09:20.239 --> 00:09:21.360]  Doesn't give a lot of interviews.
[00:09:23.038 --> 00:09:25.201]  And that's because he does not like the system.
[00:09:26.582 --> 00:09:31.428]  That's why the mainstream media likes to attack him because they know that he is basically a pro-human libertarian.
[00:09:31.708 --> 00:09:32.829]  Good friend of mine, Billy Corgan.
[00:09:33.942 --> 00:09:35.763]  SmashingPumpkinsNexus.com.
[00:09:36.183 --> 00:09:37.984]  He's playing here in Austin, Texas tonight.
[00:09:38.024 --> 00:09:39.064]  He's going to be in studio with us.
[00:09:39.104 --> 00:09:41.985]  Leanne McAdoo is picking him up right now downtown, bringing him here.
[00:09:42.605 --> 00:09:50.088]  Dr. Andrew Wakefield, the vindicated doctor and scientist that exposed the gut flora connection to autism.
[00:09:50.669 --> 00:09:56.511]  That is now in major John Hopkins studies, major Harvard Medical School studies.
[00:09:56.551 --> 00:10:01.013]  It was in the New York Times and the Washington Post, as well as the
[00:10:02.537 --> 00:10:14.205]  Wall Street Journal, just in the last month, with autism connection to the gut, and cancer connection to gut flora die-off, and so much more.
[00:10:14.365 --> 00:10:17.827]  Everything that Dr. Wakefield, 20 years ago, exposed.
[00:10:19.068 --> 00:10:24.772]  And then again, seven, eight years ago, they came out with a giant hoax, saying everything was fraud, and then he was discredited.
[00:10:26.373 --> 00:10:30.436]  The mainstream media still had power to lie then, and get hoaxes across.
[00:10:32.356 --> 00:10:33.638]  And it almost destroyed him.
[00:10:33.738 --> 00:10:36.681]  But now his partner's been officially vindicated in court.
[00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:39.644]  He, of course, has moved to the United States here in Austin.
[00:10:40.665 --> 00:10:45.970]  His new movie Vaxxed, a high-level quote official, came and personally threatened Robert De Niro.
[00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:47.251]  De Niro's now confirmed that.
[00:10:48.092 --> 00:10:50.655]  And he canceled it out of the Tribeca Film Festival he founded.
[00:10:50.695 --> 00:10:54.559]  But De Niro said last week, and it was in an article on InfoWars.com,
[00:10:56.038 --> 00:11:03.244]  That he believes everyone should see the film Vaxxed, that again was shot to a great extent in these studios here in Austin, Texas.
[00:11:04.365 --> 00:11:08.369]  So we'll be talking Vaxxed in studio with Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
[00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:17.717]  Just like they came out, and I use this as one of the most egregious examples, and they said, Alex Jones says Obama sent a tornado to Oklahoma City three years ago.
[00:11:18.487 --> 00:11:19.048]  Never said it.
[00:11:19.108 --> 00:11:20.609]  Caller asked if it was a weather weapon.
[00:11:20.969 --> 00:11:22.971]  I said, they don't really create specific tornadoes.
[00:11:23.272 --> 00:11:24.052]  It's declassified.
[00:11:24.072 --> 00:11:25.614]  They can create major weather fronts.
[00:11:25.934 --> 00:11:27.476]  A lot of governments have this technology.
[00:11:27.736 --> 00:11:30.198]  It's on the Discovery Channel, the Weather Channel, the History Channel.
[00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:36.244]  We had the father of weather weapons on first, Ben Livingston, right when it was declassified a decade ago.
[00:11:39.347 --> 00:11:41.128]  And I said, no, I don't think it's an attack.
[00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:42.450]  So they said that I said it was an attack.
[00:11:43.664 --> 00:11:47.888]  It's not about defending myself, it's about understanding how these deceivers operate.
[00:11:48.288 --> 00:11:52.993]  They get on the news and say Alex Jones influenced the Boston Bombers, and he's deeply racist.
[00:11:53.453 --> 00:11:59.339]  And they didn't show a racist quote, or how they were connected to me, only that I was exposing their CIA connection.
[00:12:01.032 --> 00:12:02.093]  that need to be investigated.
[00:12:02.253 --> 00:12:06.356]  I'm not saying the CIA even did it, but the Russians blew their cover two years before.
[00:12:07.017 --> 00:12:09.278]  They were on a State Department fake IDs.
[00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:11.060]  They were both playboys.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.783]  Boston bombing, of course, anniversary was yesterday.
[00:12:17.304 --> 00:12:20.387]  This is how they misrepresent, and they do it to Donald Trump.
[00:12:20.547 --> 00:12:27.692]  I see articles everywhere, and every time I turn the TV on now, it's folks going, it's horrible that he says Mexicans are all criminals.
[00:12:28.333 --> 00:12:30.495]  It's horrible he wants to deport all the Hispanics.
[00:12:31.602 --> 00:12:32.802]  None of that was ever said.
[00:12:34.083 --> 00:12:39.204]  He said Mexico's dumping a lot of its criminals on us here in the United States, and that's wrong.
[00:12:39.524 --> 00:12:42.005]  And people are coming here and having their kids for free, and that's wrong.
[00:12:42.505 --> 00:12:45.106]  And China's got a huge tariff on us, and that's wrong.
[00:12:45.666 --> 00:12:47.547]  That's why the power structure is so scared.
[00:12:48.987 --> 00:13:00.271]  And it's such an endorsement of Trump to have the Communist Chinese leadership and a who's who of other arch criminals, arch killers, world record regimes of evil.
[00:13:01.503 --> 00:13:27.072]  The all-time most wicked, from the Commie Pope to the Mexican presidents to the British government, the Saudi Arabian government, they all hate Donald Trump because they know he's a nationalist and they've got intelligence files on Donald Trump and they know that he reads books on the private Federal Reserve and gave money to groups to audit the Federal Reserve 25 years ago and wanted to get us out of NAFTA and GATT and is a closet patriot.
[00:13:28.373 --> 00:13:40.020]  Now, I wasn't sure of that until the last few months when I talked to so many high-level sources that say, you didn't know Donald Trump has been into the New World Order and things since before you were on air?
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.202]  That's with Dr. Corsi, who's known him well for 40 years.
[00:13:43.222 --> 00:13:47.645]  They've been in business together for 40 years in finance and in building projects.
[00:13:48.606 --> 00:13:51.668]  Corsi's a bigwig, folks, not just a three-time number one New York Times bestseller.
[00:13:51.688 --> 00:13:54.269]  He's calling Michael Savage as one of the biggest
[00:13:56.357 --> 00:14:02.739]  Supplement owners and rock star energy and best-selling author all time under another name.
[00:14:02.799 --> 00:14:03.939]  No one even knows all that.
[00:14:03.959 --> 00:14:15.163]  It's like I used the example one time I said yeah Chuck Norris is a listener and we're talking to his people he's gonna come on the show and I got all these text messages and calls like who's Chuck who's Chuck Norris?
[00:14:16.783 --> 00:14:17.643]  Well, that's another story.
[00:14:17.683 --> 00:14:18.723]  I know Chuck Norris is a listener.
[00:14:18.743 --> 00:14:19.223]  He's been on.
[00:14:19.264 --> 00:14:21.424]  I was conflating two great patriots.
[00:14:22.184 --> 00:14:24.385]  And it's okay because their names are similar.
[00:14:25.185 --> 00:14:26.325]  Chuck Yeager.
[00:14:27.465 --> 00:14:30.206]  I tell you, teleprompter free here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:30.246 --> 00:14:31.086]  Teleprompter free.
[00:14:31.106 --> 00:14:32.706]  So I get names mixed together.
[00:14:32.726 --> 00:14:33.986]  That's how we make mistakes occasionally.
[00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:34.487]  But that's good.
[00:14:34.507 --> 00:14:41.048]  It keeps my mind fresh and crackling here and a lot of times even correct myself midstream.
[00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:53.509]  So, Dr. Andrew Wakefield coming up, Billy Corgan coming up, and a lot more autism medical information and more will be broken down here today of huge magnitude.
[00:14:54.469 --> 00:14:59.574]  And Leanne McAdoo will also be popping in part of the time with us and Billy Corgan.
[00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:04.839]  Billy is going to produce a film on Americana and In Search of Americana.
[00:15:05.703 --> 00:15:06.604]  He wants to interview me.
[00:15:07.124 --> 00:15:09.085]  He works truly for it, and I'm happy to be in the film.
[00:15:09.205 --> 00:15:15.408]  It's got a pretty famous, well-known, successful documentary maker involved, and I don't know how far he's going to get into it today.
[00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:20.651]  But he also has some ideas to do kind of some popular culture shows, and that's exciting.
[00:15:22.876 --> 00:15:23.777]  I'm just too busy.
[00:15:43.596 --> 00:16:03.372]  And I'll just be quite frank with you, that's success, but I'm so busy with the day-to-day battle against the New World Order that I've just been basically not following up on, you know, having a spot on big national TV shows, which are fiction shows.
[00:16:03.992 --> 00:16:08.015]  And that's where most people are actually getting their news and information, is from fiction.
[00:16:08.916 --> 00:16:12.179]  But in a way, I think if I become involved in all of that,
[00:16:13.188 --> 00:16:20.692]  I've already basically turned Hollywood down once, that I'll be captured by it whether I like it or not.
[00:16:20.792 --> 00:16:23.093]  So it's almost like that's failure.
[00:16:24.694 --> 00:16:37.380]  If I do accept HBO shows, major movie roles, and by the way, I'm not up here bragging about all these offers I turned down or just don't follow up on.
[00:16:38.561 --> 00:16:41.743]  I want everybody to know that Liberty is super sexy.
[00:16:42.941 --> 00:16:47.845]  And ultra popular in culture, not just at the grassroots, but through the establishment as well.
[00:16:47.985 --> 00:16:50.928]  And a lot of people in the establishment do not like what's happening.
[00:16:51.248 --> 00:16:54.330]  And they really want to try to turn things around as well.
[00:16:54.711 --> 00:16:58.994]  But it's the very, very top of the pyramid that is anti-human and very destructive.
[00:16:59.014 --> 00:17:02.617]  And it controls the issuance of currency and credit, the big central banks.
[00:17:03.238 --> 00:17:04.679]  And that's why we're in so much trouble.
[00:17:04.719 --> 00:17:11.585]  No matter if the will of humanity wants to get out of this oppression and this dehumanization, there is an unseen
[00:17:12.165 --> 00:17:20.030]  Hand with an all-seeing eye, wreathed in flame, that is continuing to try to suppress human destiny.
[00:17:22.551 --> 00:17:29.675]  But there's a great truth that's being borne out every day now, as giant lies collapse into the dustbin of history.
[00:17:29.916 --> 00:17:40.482]  And I want to explain something right now, before we go to break, and come back and get into all the news, that is extremely profound, and absolutely essential to understand if we're going to
[00:17:42.168 --> 00:17:44.409]  Transcend our current position.
[00:17:47.511 --> 00:17:57.256]  Because through this microcosm, it's a doorway into the understanding and perception of every other big problem we face.
[00:18:00.578 --> 00:18:10.524]  The 9-11 Commission came out and basically admitted they were ordered to rubber stamp a secretly written
[00:18:11.687 --> 00:18:15.691]  Globalist report put together by Zelikow and the neocons.
[00:18:18.595 --> 00:18:22.959]  And the fact that six of the ten commissioners went public never really got a lot of attention until now.
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.142]  It seismically is building.
[00:18:28.183 --> 00:18:37.866]  But what's really profound is the congressional report got almost no attention before it, and all the hundreds of whistleblowers that were arrested, killed, persecuted, got almost no attention.
[00:18:38.546 --> 00:18:42.167]  And those of us that would talk about all the whistleblowers, we got demonized.
[00:18:42.387 --> 00:18:47.709]  And the media would say that we were making it up, and never give any facts or misrepresent.
[00:18:49.229 --> 00:18:51.010]  But the profound statement is this.
[00:18:52.991 --> 00:18:54.171]  You can't stop the signal.
[00:18:56.241 --> 00:19:08.624]  And 9-11 Truth has now basically been certified, been proven correct, and the establishment has got some splaining to do, as they say, and you can't put that genie back in the bottle.
[00:19:10.407 --> 00:19:16.833]  And what's even more profound about that overall statement is they did everything they could to suppress it, everything they could to bully.
[00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:29.606]  And now the Saudis have come out threatening to remove $750 billion out of the United States, showing how we're kept, showing how we're controlled, showing how we're slaves, at least in their views.
[00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:32.218]  But it's the Streisand effect.
[00:19:32.298 --> 00:19:36.103]  You try to cover something up, it only gives it that much more attention.
[00:19:36.163 --> 00:19:37.525]  Me thinks you protest too much.
[00:19:38.025 --> 00:19:39.287]  Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.
[00:19:39.707 --> 00:19:43.733]  And what's in the 28 pages has already come out because everybody's leaked it.
[00:19:44.013 --> 00:19:45.675]  Members of Congress have come on and told you.
[00:19:46.296 --> 00:19:47.598]  Colonels have come on and told you.
[00:19:48.564 --> 00:19:51.707]  Congressman Walter Jones, Colonel Schaffer, countless others.
[00:19:52.127 --> 00:19:53.788]  So we know from every angle.
[00:19:54.229 --> 00:19:59.893]  I mean, look, Dr. Pachinik's been at the CFR while they sit around and openly discussed how they did it, okay?
[00:20:00.334 --> 00:20:01.755]  By the way, I'm gonna get him back on.
[00:20:02.695 --> 00:20:03.956]  Do you understand that, folks?
[00:20:03.996 --> 00:20:08.260]  At the highest levels, they all know they did it with Saudi Arabia.
[00:20:09.441 --> 00:20:10.662]  And they thought they'd get away with it.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:27.849]  I've been warning you for a long, long time that strategic elites, governmental and corporate power structures have been digging in for a societal and cultural collapse that will make the Great Depression of the 1930s look tame in comparison.
[00:20:35.322 --> 00:20:42.948]  Now, major university studies estimate that more than 7 million Americans starved to death or died via malnutrition during the Great Depression.
[00:20:43.128 --> 00:20:48.212]  The United States fared better than some nations because we were still agrarian.
[00:20:48.292 --> 00:20:49.413]  We were still farmers.
[00:20:49.793 --> 00:20:51.975]  We were not the urban dwellers we are today.
[00:20:52.295 --> 00:20:53.456]  In fact, the numbers have flipped.
[00:20:53.956 --> 00:21:00.922]  In the 1930s, about 89% of people considered themselves rural and about 11% were urban or city.
[00:21:03.007 --> 00:21:11.034]  Now those numbers have basically flipped with maybe 10-11% being rural and upwards of 90% being urban.
[00:21:11.334 --> 00:21:13.836]  We are totally dependent on this system.
[00:21:14.057 --> 00:21:18.621]  And now a top insurer warns global unrest could go viral.
[00:21:19.281 --> 00:21:21.522]  Violent riots threaten international stability.
[00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:30.364]  Lloyds of London has commissioned the leading risk management agency, Risk Advisory Group, to produce a report analyzing these factors.
[00:21:30.684 --> 00:21:35.966]  The story is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:21:36.506 --> 00:21:40.427]  And if you add it into all the other massive preparations that are taking place, it's stunning.
[00:21:41.067 --> 00:21:49.299]  Billionaires in Europe, the United States, and areas like New Zealand are digging in and building multi-billion dollar, in some cases, armored redoubts.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.382]  Local governments are digging in.
[00:21:51.843 --> 00:21:55.688]  And then policies are being put in place to shut down half of our power plants.
[00:21:56.209 --> 00:22:03.471]  and cut off our energy and put regulations on farmers that bankrupt them and shut down local industries and jobs.
[00:22:03.751 --> 00:22:04.731]  It's cloward and pivot.
[00:22:04.791 --> 00:22:07.432]  They want us bankrupt so we can be socially engineered.
[00:22:07.812 --> 00:22:11.273]  This is the globalist revolution against humanity.
[00:22:11.553 --> 00:22:19.415]  We have to stand up and say we are the constitutionalist, we are the anti-globalist, we are the nationalist, we are the global pro-human
[00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.710]  Renaissance.
[00:22:22.151 --> 00:22:22.571]  Movement.
[00:22:23.071 --> 00:22:24.092]  Whatever you want to call it.
[00:22:24.292 --> 00:22:25.293]  We're against feudalism.
[00:22:25.333 --> 00:22:26.093]  We're against serfdom.
[00:22:26.634 --> 00:22:28.575]  And we have to get armed with the truth.
[00:22:29.295 --> 00:22:31.096]  And we have to get armed with our own gardens.
[00:22:31.497 --> 00:22:32.657]  And we have to get prepared.
[00:22:32.777 --> 00:22:36.620]  Another part of a solution, in closing, is to have storable foods.
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.522]  If you don't have storable foods, you're totally dependent on the system.
[00:22:40.642 --> 00:22:46.487]  InfoWars Select is the lowest price you're going to find anywhere on high quality storable foods at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:22:46.928 --> 00:22:52.332]  Find the very best storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:22:52.853 --> 00:22:57.357]  Find our nutraceuticals, it's also key to be as healthy as possible, at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:57.817 --> 00:23:07.525]  And whatever you do, redouble your efforts in the information war and tell your neighbors, your friends, your family, your co-workers, your church members, whoever they are,
[00:23:08.547 --> 00:23:16.827]  The Infowars.com has its finger on the pulse of what's happening and is trying to mobilize humanity in peaceful preparation and resistance against it.
[00:23:17.108 --> 00:23:17.850]  But whatever you do...
[00:23:19.178 --> 00:23:21.699]  Let's pray for peace and prepare for war.
[00:23:22.819 --> 00:23:26.980]  And when I say war, I mean the globalist war of famine and economic collapse.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.601]  They don't want us to be prepared.
[00:23:28.961 --> 00:23:30.241]  They don't want us to be independent.
[00:23:30.641 --> 00:23:32.622]  I hope we never have to use our storable foods.
[00:23:33.062 --> 00:23:35.203]  I hope we never have to defend ourselves with the Second Amendment.
[00:23:35.803 --> 00:23:42.785]  But now it's becoming a probability, almost a certainty, and not just the possibility it was 21 years ago when I first got on air.
[00:23:43.525 --> 00:23:45.747]  Everybody in their gut knows big stuff's happening.
[00:23:45.947 --> 00:23:47.429]  You can also see it economically.
[00:23:47.729 --> 00:23:49.090]  You can also see it culturally.
[00:23:49.591 --> 00:23:51.392]  You can see it unfolding all around you.
[00:23:51.833 --> 00:23:59.539]  Now is the time to get prepared, and the front lines of true preparedness starts at InfoWars.com and InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:09.188]  And finally, when you shop with the good guys, you're helping fund the tip of the spear in the information war that's so key while getting the high-quality products you and your family desperately need.
[00:24:19.708 --> 00:24:24.270]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:24:26.891 --> 00:24:47.260]  Sending out an SOS globally that we should make decisions in our families, in our businesses, and in our lives that will promote freedom and liberty in a pro-human world that is based on due process and honor and free will, free association.
[00:24:49.761 --> 00:25:09.955]  We now see collectivism run by the big offshore megabanks taking over, and with it, the banning of speech, the attack on the family, and any institution that would compete with the hive-borg panopticonic technocratic technocracy that is being foisted upon us in the technotronic era.
[00:25:12.076 --> 00:25:17.920]  And I suggest, if you want to learn about those things, you read books like The Technotronic Era.
[00:25:19.042 --> 00:25:38.097]  By former National Security Advisors Zbigniew Brzezinski, one of the main engineers and authors of the modern world, the black bag sack that humanity is being stuffed into and thrown in the back of a white dented up creeper van.
[00:25:39.618 --> 00:25:41.700]  Quite the analogy.
[00:25:44.882 --> 00:25:47.745]  Top of DrudgeReport.com right now.
[00:25:49.651 --> 00:25:53.453]  Is an InfoWars.com story.
[00:25:54.993 --> 00:25:57.775]  Fight over delegates, rules escalates.
[00:25:58.115 --> 00:26:03.757]  The media is having to admit now that actually they are even violating their own rules and this has never before been done.
[00:26:03.817 --> 00:26:07.759]  Just stealing stuff, cancelling elections, cancelling primaries.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.221]  Giuliani, Trump should get nomination if he's close.
[00:26:13.015 --> 00:26:19.657]  And then our article, Rap Song Threatens Riots, Trump Assassination, Media Celebrates!
[00:26:21.537 --> 00:26:23.418]  Media Celebrates!
[00:26:24.138 --> 00:26:29.459]  And there's the article by Paul Joseph Watson up on Infowars.com.
[00:26:29.519 --> 00:26:37.521]  I'm going to be getting to that because it ties into this culture pushed by the social justice warriors in Europe and the United States
[00:26:39.264 --> 00:26:42.827]  To bully and attack anyone you disagree with.
[00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:56.120]  And then to have in the safe spaces, the public schools, the colleges, the police, the new political police, carefully selected, do nothing as you're physically attacked.
[00:26:58.507 --> 00:27:12.513]  And that's what the whole social justice warrior George Soros, Black Lives Matter movements about is through the Strong Cities UN initiative in the State Department and Justice Department's own words, take over local police departments.
[00:27:13.513 --> 00:27:17.675]  And boy, once the UN and the globalists have control of our local police departments,
[00:27:18.888 --> 00:27:24.074]  And local city councils and local county commissions, they are in the catbird seat.
[00:27:24.394 --> 00:27:28.699]  You are seeing, I am seeing, we are witnessing a real takeover.
[00:27:31.282 --> 00:27:32.404]  You're like, wow, that's bold.
[00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:36.428]  Yeah, it's bold to pass Obamacare written by foreign banks to double and triple your prices.
[00:27:37.688 --> 00:27:42.710]  It's bold to say father and mother can't be used in public documents, or he or she.
[00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:45.270]  It's bold to attack the family.
[00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:48.171]  It's bold to completely open the borders outside of law.
[00:27:48.591 --> 00:28:00.795]  It's bold to bring in 5 million radical jihadis, 80% of military-age men, many of them jihadis, into Europe, let them attack, and then take German and French rights away and declare martial law.
[00:28:02.133 --> 00:28:11.999]  It's bold to sign us onto 2.2 and growing quadrillion dollars globally in fake counterfeit money that makes Madoff look like a legitimate businessman.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:20.744]  It's bold to have a secret vaccine damage fund quietly paying out billions to the dead and dying from the vaccines if you jump through 100 hoops.
[00:28:22.705 --> 00:28:26.627]  It's bold to genetically engineer human chimeras on hundreds of U.S.
[00:28:26.668 --> 00:28:28.789]  farms for organ harvesting in the U.S.
[00:28:30.131 --> 00:28:31.892]  Part human, part cow creatures.
[00:28:34.093 --> 00:28:38.156]  And then they have mainstream media make fun of me when they know that's MIT Associated Press Reuters.
[00:28:40.457 --> 00:28:49.182]  It's bold to detonate over 200 high-powered hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere in the 1960s in an attempt to destroy the atmosphere.
[00:28:51.424 --> 00:28:56.407]  That's Discovery Channel, Trinity, with William Shatner.
[00:28:58.168 --> 00:29:02.349]  I remember reading about it in textbooks a decade before that came out and not believing it.
[00:29:02.849 --> 00:29:14.312]  Then it showed the first time high-def 35mm and 80mm film with the nukes going off trying to blow holes in the Van Allen radiation belt and try to see if they could ignite our atmosphere.
[00:29:14.692 --> 00:29:15.852]  It's bold!
[00:29:15.872 --> 00:29:25.034]  They have thousands of labs with gene guns splicing thousands of species a day looking for random super mutagens.
[00:29:25.931 --> 00:29:39.029]  It's bold to have over 100 BioShield Level 4 facilities in Level 2 with weaponized strains of Ebola and everything else you can imagine that have 98% kill rates like mousepox.
[00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:40.170]  It's bold.
[00:29:41.291 --> 00:29:46.556]  It's bold for our government to fund ISIS and Al Qaeda to take over four nations and then allow them into the U.S.
[00:29:46.576 --> 00:29:52.141]  with sleeper cells awaiting when they launch their Tet Offensive that the government will use to bring in martial law.
[00:29:52.961 --> 00:29:58.486]  It's bold to have a private Federal Reserve that taxes the American people every April that calls itself governmental.
[00:29:58.927 --> 00:29:59.827]  It's bold!
[00:30:00.628 --> 00:30:01.509]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.009 --> 00:30:03.631]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.551 --> 00:30:07.254]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.852 --> 00:30:13.272]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:30:13.753 --> 00:30:19.694]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:30:19.915 --> 00:30:34.079]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running 6 miles every other day, swimming 2-3 miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights
[00:30:34.619 --> 00:30:36.581]  We're focusing on fighting the globalists.
[00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:44.807]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:30:45.027 --> 00:30:52.172]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:30:52.453 --> 00:30:58.177]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:30:58.297 --> 00:31:04.482]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[00:31:04.722 --> 00:31:10.124]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[00:31:10.344 --> 00:31:14.686]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:31:14.886 --> 00:31:17.147]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:31:17.327 --> 00:31:25.691]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:31:25.951 --> 00:31:29.293]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:31:29.453 --> 00:31:39.920]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:31:40.101 --> 00:31:47.385]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:31:47.586 --> 00:31:49.467]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:31:49.807 --> 00:31:57.453]  Supermail Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:31:57.774 --> 00:32:03.939]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:32:04.239 --> 00:32:11.165]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Supermail Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:32:11.445 --> 00:32:20.452]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:32:20.532 --> 00:32:28.779]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:28.939 --> 00:32:33.643]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:32:33.823 --> 00:32:37.206]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[00:32:38.667 --> 00:32:39.487]  We're good to go.
[00:33:02.594 --> 00:33:06.297]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:06.357 --> 00:33:07.699]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:30.945 --> 00:33:32.666]  Is this some conspiracy?
[00:33:33.967 --> 00:33:35.568]  Oh, you bet your bottom dollar it is.
[00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:40.351]  Takeover of a very important planet.
[00:33:41.993 --> 00:33:43.113]  Our species is amazing.
[00:33:43.594 --> 00:33:44.995]  We have unlimited potential.
[00:33:45.455 --> 00:33:47.877]  And the elite want to steal the brain trust of humanity.
[00:33:49.658 --> 00:33:50.899]  And run for the door.
[00:33:51.919 --> 00:33:55.342]  Walling themselves off in a breakaway civilization.
[00:33:57.028 --> 00:34:07.354]  But the words of Roy Batty in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, when he meets his maker, his artificial maker, he tells him, I want more life.
[00:34:09.175 --> 00:34:09.335]  Father.
[00:34:14.507 --> 00:34:17.029]  That's originally what he said, but they let him improvise and change it.
[00:34:17.049 --> 00:34:19.071]  A little more flair to it.
[00:34:19.992 --> 00:34:21.514]  I want more life.
[00:34:21.534 --> 00:34:24.517]  They're not going to steal the whole brain trust.
[00:34:24.617 --> 00:34:27.620]  Our species developed countless struggles.
[00:34:29.101 --> 00:34:32.545]  Just because you are lowdown pirates doesn't give you the right to rule.
[00:34:32.565 --> 00:34:37.389]  And the minute you started trying to dumb humanity down, you forfeited any claim.
[00:34:38.607 --> 00:34:45.173]  Not just to continue on with our species, but to reach some type of promised land.
[00:34:45.653 --> 00:34:48.836]  You will never reach your promised land, New World Order.
[00:34:49.916 --> 00:34:56.662]  You are only providing the test so that the true medal of humanity will rise.
[00:34:58.143 --> 00:34:59.745]  And deep down, you know you're a failure.
[00:35:01.026 --> 00:35:02.827]  Deep down, you know you're fallen.
[00:35:03.908 --> 00:35:04.889]  Fallen from the beginning.
[00:35:08.573 --> 00:35:10.014]  Cemetery Gates, Pantera.
[00:35:10.575 --> 00:35:13.156]  Probably one of the best heavy songs ever.
[00:35:13.717 --> 00:35:14.677]  Hard to turn this off.
[00:35:19.281 --> 00:35:24.204]  It's a love song.
[00:35:25.405 --> 00:35:27.026]  See, evil people think love is weak.
[00:35:27.807 --> 00:35:28.427]  No, it's not.
[00:35:29.608 --> 00:35:33.310]  Because it's with love and standing up for our families and the things that we do care about.
[00:35:34.151 --> 00:35:35.092]  We find strengths.
[00:35:38.138 --> 00:35:39.119]  Far greater.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:47.023]  And evil people would call far darker and twisted than anything you wicked people could ever imagine.
[00:35:47.043 --> 00:35:55.707]  And the sleeping giant that is humanity is rising.
[00:35:56.367 --> 00:35:57.248]  And you can feel it.
[00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:05.292]  Alright, let's get into the news right now.
[00:36:06.758 --> 00:36:09.439]  First off, Billy Corgan should probably be getting here soon.
[00:36:09.459 --> 00:36:11.420]  He's going to be on in the second hour.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:17.222]  Leanne McAleer, right before we kicked off 36 minutes ago, was here in studio with me, getting ready.
[00:36:17.482 --> 00:36:24.124]  And one way you can get more folks to tune in online, which you're doing every day, the show is just exploding, is to retweet
[00:36:25.362 --> 00:36:29.964]  The tweet I put out at Leanne McAdoo, leaving the studio now to pick up Billy Corgan, stay tuned.
[00:36:30.405 --> 00:36:44.892]  And then you can go down below that and send out the link that Paul Watson put out this morning as well, when he breaks down the fact that Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins will basically demolish the Social Justice Warriors.
[00:36:44.912 --> 00:36:45.232]  There it is.
[00:36:45.252 --> 00:36:46.293]  Special guest on the show today.
[00:36:46.313 --> 00:36:49.394]  And then Paul goes over all of it.
[00:36:50.255 --> 00:36:50.995]  We saw it during the break.
[00:36:51.015 --> 00:36:54.077]  If we go to the tweet he sent out, the actual one he sent out, because that's not it.
[00:36:55.356 --> 00:36:55.917]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:36:55.937 --> 00:36:56.518]  That was it right there.
[00:36:56.558 --> 00:36:57.019]  Go back to that.
[00:36:57.039 --> 00:36:57.340]  Thank you.
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.403]  I need to control this myself, I guess.
[00:36:59.443 --> 00:37:00.124]  Just go back up.
[00:37:00.625 --> 00:37:01.046]  Go back up.
[00:37:01.527 --> 00:37:01.948]  Go back up.
[00:37:02.348 --> 00:37:02.749]  Go back up.
[00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:03.631]  Go back up.
[00:37:03.671 --> 00:37:04.212]  There it is right there.
[00:37:04.392 --> 00:37:04.592]  See it?
[00:37:05.494 --> 00:37:06.155]  Just read it.
[00:37:06.896 --> 00:37:07.678]  It's on the bottom now.
[00:37:08.806 --> 00:37:09.066]  That's it.
[00:37:09.086 --> 00:37:09.266]  See?
[00:37:09.347 --> 00:37:10.407]  Scroll up a little bit.
[00:37:10.447 --> 00:37:10.688]  Thanks.
[00:37:11.328 --> 00:37:12.129]  And then I can read it to folks.
[00:37:12.169 --> 00:37:16.453]  Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan will demolish social justice warrior brainwashing in studio today.
[00:37:16.733 --> 00:37:17.273]  Thanks, guys.
[00:37:17.554 --> 00:37:22.178]  That's an important link to send out to everybody you know.
[00:37:22.378 --> 00:37:26.121]  And look, sending that link out won't save the world, as I've said 10,000 times.
[00:37:26.461 --> 00:37:34.908]  But the act of doing it continually and resisting and taking action, somebody that's into rock and roll and Billy Corgan and Smashing Pumpkins,
[00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:41.827]  Maybe one of his ex-girlfriends or something, you know, will, who's famous, will then watch and then wake up and then will speak out.
[00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:45.432]  You know, folks like Taylor Swift were big listeners.
[00:37:46.433 --> 00:37:48.655]  And then, of course, Russell Brand's a big listener.
[00:37:48.675 --> 00:37:49.735]  That's why he's been on the show a lot.
[00:37:49.755 --> 00:37:51.397]  People say, I don't care about Russell Brand.
[00:37:51.777 --> 00:37:52.117]  Oh, really?
[00:37:52.157 --> 00:37:56.961]  We have videos we've done with him with 10 million viewers, finding out about world government, the new world order.
[00:37:57.321 --> 00:38:07.489]  So if I have a famous golf player on or a famous football player on or I have a famous producer on or I have a top banker on or I have the number two in the Japanese government on,
[00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:09.791]  Or I have Donald Trump on.
[00:38:09.991 --> 00:38:14.493]  That hits the audiences that are tuned in to that personality or that individual.
[00:38:14.773 --> 00:38:22.617]  And that's how we reach more and more people in the fight against the globalists and their attempt to dehumanize the world population.
[00:38:24.038 --> 00:38:24.878]  That's how we're doing it.
[00:38:24.899 --> 00:38:29.281]  And I know I'm stating simple things here, but that's why sending out the links is so important.
[00:38:29.301 --> 00:38:29.461]  Look.
[00:38:31.476 --> 00:38:33.157]  9-11 happened 15 years ago.
[00:38:33.417 --> 00:38:34.237]  I knew it was coming.
[00:38:34.417 --> 00:38:37.178]  I knew bin Laden was connected to Western intelligence agencies.
[00:38:37.938 --> 00:38:43.240]  I could see them hyping that there was about to be a imminent attack.
[00:38:46.481 --> 00:38:49.261]  I knew that they were about to take our liberties when that imminent attack came.
[00:38:50.022 --> 00:38:50.942]  They're putting out different
[00:38:51.946 --> 00:38:55.449]  Rand Corporation document saying a huge catalyzing terror attacks coming.
[00:38:55.710 --> 00:39:05.119]  When it does, we're going to radically transform your world and basically get rid of freedom in America and launch a global corporate empire with US government funding.
[00:39:09.898 --> 00:39:20.830]  And then it all happened, and they wrote the PMAC document a year before 9-11, Dick Cheney and Jeb Bush did, saying we need a large catalyzing terror attack that kills around 3,000 people like Pearl Harbor.
[00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:24.333]  They actually say, on the order of Pearl Harbor, boy, got the number just right.
[00:39:25.114 --> 00:39:28.496]  And that we're going to use that to, quote, cause a clash of civilizations.
[00:39:29.016 --> 00:39:32.198]  But then in the next phase, we don't defeat radical Islam.
[00:39:32.238 --> 00:39:39.862]  It's one thing if they staged it as an evil false flag for a greater good, and a Machiavellian injustifies the means to crush radical Islam.
[00:39:40.102 --> 00:39:42.183]  I would still be against it and say it was wrong, obviously.
[00:39:43.124 --> 00:39:48.387]  Because nothing done in great evil for supposed good ever ends up turning into something good.
[00:39:48.627 --> 00:39:52.109]  It's like the Ring of Mordor allegory, or parallel.
[00:39:54.588 --> 00:39:57.353]  But instead, they're double-crossing us with Saudi Arabia.
[00:39:57.393 --> 00:39:58.234]  That's their payoff.
[00:39:58.274 --> 00:40:03.182]  And now flooding us with the very jihadis from the very group of al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[00:40:04.534 --> 00:40:08.618]  Who fly the flag of Saudi Arabia on black, it's just not green.
[00:40:09.479 --> 00:40:11.361]  It's the very same group, admittedly.
[00:40:11.961 --> 00:40:18.728]  And because we've been made ignorant geopolitically, culturally, historically, the average person still doesn't know what's happening.
[00:40:18.748 --> 00:40:20.190]  But Donald Trump does.
[00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:27.337]  And Donald Trump has the will to put his life on the line in basically a suicide mission.
[00:40:29.039 --> 00:40:33.102]  To be demonized, to be lied about, to be boycotted, to be misrepresented.
[00:40:33.342 --> 00:40:37.205]  He's already lost, it's estimated, close to a billion dollars the last year.
[00:40:39.887 --> 00:40:46.612]  Major Catholic colleges are saying, no one's allowed to stay at your hotels and no one's allowed to play golf at your resorts for our college teams.
[00:40:46.672 --> 00:40:49.834]  I mean, they're canceling his beauty pageants.
[00:40:49.855 --> 00:40:52.577]  They're trying to ban him building in Europe.
[00:40:52.597 --> 00:40:55.559]  They're trying to kick him out of the UK where his mother was born.
[00:40:57.177 --> 00:41:03.918]  In Scotland, they are doing everything they can because he's a nationalist, period.
[00:41:05.278 --> 00:41:06.459]  We're already captured.
[00:41:06.499 --> 00:41:08.359]  They already took us over through fraud.
[00:41:08.559 --> 00:41:09.339]  That's not rhetoric.
[00:41:09.439 --> 00:41:10.459]  We are captured.
[00:41:10.779 --> 00:41:19.881]  Now they're mopping up saying you don't have free speech and don't say mother or father and we're going to take your private property and we're going to arrest the Amish all over the country for having their own milk.
[00:41:20.861 --> 00:41:21.961]  I mean, it's happening, folks.
[00:41:21.981 --> 00:41:24.882]  They're going after anybody that's not part of the corporate borg.
[00:41:27.247 --> 00:41:28.868]  Here's another analogy.
[00:41:29.008 --> 00:41:33.410]  The 1984, 82, whatever it is, remake, John Carpenter, The Thing, Kurt Russell, a true classic.
[00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:36.271]  Super good sci-fi horror.
[00:41:36.431 --> 00:41:37.111]  Excellent actors.
[00:41:37.391 --> 00:41:38.932]  One of my favorite sci-fi movies.
[00:41:39.332 --> 00:41:40.212]  I'm a sci-fi buff.
[00:41:42.413 --> 00:41:43.134]  Here's the allegory.
[00:41:43.434 --> 00:41:44.314]  Alien crashes.
[00:41:45.014 --> 00:41:45.595]  Gets out.
[00:41:46.495 --> 00:41:48.596]  It's gonna take over every organism on the Earth.
[00:41:48.616 --> 00:41:52.798]  It's a super predator dominant species.
[00:41:53.849 --> 00:41:54.930]  Is it going to leave?
[00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:58.031]  The Amish aren't going to resist it when it's taken over.
[00:41:58.091 --> 00:41:59.172]  Is it going to leave them out there?
[00:41:59.212 --> 00:42:04.795]  No, it's going to take over every bug, every mouse, every person, every bacteria, every virus.
[00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:06.936]  It's going to replicate and take over.
[00:42:07.456 --> 00:42:13.399]  But at least the alien takes over and becomes the form that it was on that planet so that it can adapt and survive.
[00:42:14.439 --> 00:42:18.942]  The globalists are rewriting everything, playing God, because they're not an alien.
[00:42:19.362 --> 00:42:22.724]  They are psycho control freaks that want to play God who are
[00:42:23.775 --> 00:42:32.437]  Trying to overthrow creation and leave ugly, twisted, stinking messes in its wake.
[00:42:35.618 --> 00:42:40.199]  And they argue, well, we're like little two-year-olds with finger pains and we're going to get better.
[00:42:40.599 --> 00:42:41.460]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:42.960]  Your experiment
[00:42:44.602 --> 00:42:50.524]  He's running over my free will and my destiny and everybody else's and you didn't ask me about your plans for myself and my family.
[00:42:50.864 --> 00:42:54.245]  You didn't announce publicly what you were doing.
[00:42:54.285 --> 00:42:58.846]  You put it in white papers and you're doing it, but you didn't get my consent.
[00:42:58.866 --> 00:42:59.847]  They go, well you don't have free will.
[00:43:00.487 --> 00:43:01.787]  Oh, then you don't have free will either.
[00:43:01.847 --> 00:43:02.307]  Oh, I get it.
[00:43:02.587 --> 00:43:04.108]  You have free will, but I don't.
[00:43:05.575 --> 00:43:19.240]  I've got to use all the words you say to not hurt somebody's feelings, but you can spray aluminum dioxide and barium salts by the tens of thousands of tons a week that we know of into the atmosphere.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.061]  You have all these rights, I have nothing.
[00:43:24.125 --> 00:43:25.065]  I'm just a machine.
[00:43:25.165 --> 00:43:26.546]  I'm just a biological computer.
[00:43:26.926 --> 00:43:27.786]  I don't have any free will.
[00:43:27.806 --> 00:43:29.407]  That's a mind game from you people.
[00:43:29.627 --> 00:43:34.088]  So I just roll over, turn the television on, and let you tell me what reality is.
[00:43:34.328 --> 00:43:35.748]  That's not happening anymore.
[00:43:37.709 --> 00:43:51.713]  And so as you see the fact that Saudi Arabia was heavily involved in 9-11, with our own criminal elements in our government and other governments, and now Obama has come out and said that he will veto a bill and has warned Congress
[00:43:52.952 --> 00:44:02.217]  And it will bring down the Bushes, it will bring down the Clintons, it will bring down the whole corrupt national security structure that's been set up since 1947.
[00:44:04.164 --> 00:44:06.305]  And by the way, you know who wants it to come down the worst?
[00:44:06.725 --> 00:44:16.029]  The good people in the FBI, the CIA, Defense Intelligence, the Geospatial Center, and 60 or 70 other major agencies who know what happened.
[00:44:16.289 --> 00:44:17.169]  It's their business.
[00:44:17.449 --> 00:44:18.770]  They know there was a stand-down.
[00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:25.473]  I remember when an aide to a top general in 2007 leaked a Rumsfeld.
[00:44:25.493 --> 00:44:26.093]  We ought to find it.
[00:44:26.733 --> 00:44:27.493]  I forget the headline.
[00:44:27.533 --> 00:44:30.855]  It was like, Generals told Rumsfeld they needed another 9-11.
[00:44:33.126 --> 00:44:40.368]  And it's a whole bunch of generals at the Pentagon in Rumsfeld saying, sir, before you leave, we need another 9-11.
[00:44:40.468 --> 00:44:42.209]  Maybe it was 2006.
[00:44:42.889 --> 00:44:45.150]  We need one to be able to complete our operations.
[00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:51.952]  The public just isn't listening, isn't going along with these wars, because they had been told we were doing 9-11 to take out Al Qaeda.
[00:44:53.273 --> 00:44:56.474]  And of course, then they weren't providing them with the actual mission to defeat
[00:44:57.605 --> 00:44:58.566]  And they were being double-crossed.
[00:44:58.586 --> 00:45:04.873]  So you hear the generals in the meeting with one Bible page thinness of plausible deniability.
[00:45:05.274 --> 00:45:07.356]  They are openly saying, sir, we've only had one.
[00:45:07.376 --> 00:45:08.858]  It got the public to wake up.
[00:45:08.918 --> 00:45:09.659]  We need another.
[00:45:10.339 --> 00:45:11.180]  Can we have another?
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.682]  I ought to play that tape.
[00:45:12.722 --> 00:45:14.164]  I played it many times years ago.
[00:45:15.826 --> 00:45:17.908]  And they're there begging him for another 9-11.
[00:45:19.124 --> 00:45:20.185]  To crush radicalism.
[00:45:20.946 --> 00:45:23.708]  They didn't get the memo, you're not going to crush it.
[00:45:23.949 --> 00:45:29.234]  This was to stir it up, make Al Qaeda heroes, launch the new generation ISIS, and take over the world.
[00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:34.078]  Guys, try this.
[00:45:34.118 --> 00:45:38.382]  I know we used to be on 9-11 Blogger when we broke the story, but that's a site that may have it indexed.
[00:45:38.442 --> 00:45:39.023]  I would type in...
[00:45:42.156 --> 00:45:46.439]  Generals told Rumsfeld that the public needs a new 9-11.
[00:45:47.079 --> 00:45:47.739]  That's the headline.
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:48.560]  There it is.
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.361]  Former CIA and DIA operatives warned of another 9-11 attack.
[00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:52.342]  No, that's not it.
[00:45:52.522 --> 00:45:55.564]  You guys are clicking News Tab, which is fine.
[00:45:55.604 --> 00:45:57.225]  You're really getting expert at this.
[00:45:57.485 --> 00:45:58.265]  Click Web.
[00:45:58.345 --> 00:45:59.026]  This is old.
[00:46:02.546 --> 00:46:03.746]  You want to go to old.
[00:46:03.806 --> 00:46:05.527]  You want to go to web to search it.
[00:46:06.067 --> 00:46:07.847]  Whenever it's more than six months old.
[00:46:07.867 --> 00:46:10.588]  We have some new crew.
[00:46:10.608 --> 00:46:11.928]  We're augmenting the crew and expanding.
[00:46:11.948 --> 00:46:12.628]  We have great crew.
[00:46:12.968 --> 00:46:15.108]  You'll just see me directing up here on air quite a bit.
[00:46:15.148 --> 00:46:16.249]  That is not putting them down.
[00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:23.190]  That is, in this social justice warrior status out there, not with my crew, but with some of the general public, directing people and teaching them is a bad thing.
[00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:24.610]  That's why dodgeballs banned.
[00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:26.071]  Any contact sports are trying to ban.
[00:46:26.291 --> 00:46:28.011]  They don't want people to actually communicate.
[00:46:28.491 --> 00:46:33.255]  And then a boss talking to someone is a sign of hatred and evil in the Social Justice Warrior Class Show.
[00:46:33.715 --> 00:46:34.416]  They're not like that.
[00:46:34.436 --> 00:46:41.101]  I just want viewers to know that when I'm telling them, no, do this, do that, that is just the total transparency of the first show where someone directs from the cockpit.
[00:46:41.862 --> 00:46:43.563]  There isn't somebody back there in the back directing.
[00:46:43.603 --> 00:46:44.044]  I'm doing it.
[00:46:46.286 --> 00:46:48.007]  So, we will find that.
[00:46:48.027 --> 00:46:49.248]  In fact, I want to bring that back.
[00:46:49.288 --> 00:46:49.989]  I want to find that.
[00:46:50.629 --> 00:46:53.251]  The guy that can always find anything is Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:46:53.892 --> 00:46:55.993]  In fact, I want to talk about his article next.
[00:46:56.093 --> 00:46:57.234]  It's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:46:59.568 --> 00:47:04.292]  By the way, the mainstream media has figured out that Roger Stone's the most influential person with Trump right now.
[00:47:04.312 --> 00:47:05.693]  I mean, Trump's the most influential.
[00:47:05.733 --> 00:47:11.477]  He makes the main decisions, but they figured out that Roger Stone, former head of the campaign, is basically the top quarterback.
[00:47:11.837 --> 00:47:15.500]  They got a couple quarterbacks in there, but he's the one moving them down the field.
[00:47:16.981 --> 00:47:24.887]  And Stone's gonna be breaking big news here tomorrow, and he sent me a whole bunch of articles today where the media is having conniption fits about him and more.
[00:47:27.225 --> 00:47:28.345]  Send Paul a transmission.
[00:47:28.485 --> 00:47:29.306]  He's probably listening.
[00:47:29.326 --> 00:47:36.668]  Maybe one of you guys can call him, because I've got that fever going now, where I've got to have something, and I've wanted it before and forgot to make a big issue out of it.
[00:47:36.968 --> 00:47:41.330]  I want that Pentagon briefing with the top generals with Rumsfeld.
[00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:44.211]  They're around a roundtable, conference table.
[00:47:44.251 --> 00:47:45.251]  It's amazing audio.
[00:47:46.112 --> 00:47:53.294]  And they admitted it was real audio smuggled out, where whoever was in there thought, of the aides that were in there, thought, wow, this is pretty important.
[00:47:53.494 --> 00:47:55.175]  They're saying, sir, can we please have another 9-11?
[00:47:57.793 --> 00:47:58.854]  Pretty big smoking gun.
[00:47:59.034 --> 00:48:04.997]  And you know, that's what I'm getting at here is the Saudis want to take their money out of the U.S.
[00:48:05.017 --> 00:48:06.178]  They want to play all these games.
[00:48:06.618 --> 00:48:07.639]  It's already out.
[00:48:07.679 --> 00:48:15.363]  We already know from Congressman Jones and Senator Graham and countless others that have read the 28 pages and ran Paul and
[00:48:17.276 --> 00:48:25.619]  Are NSA whistleblowers and FBI whistleblowers, the countless ones I've had on, that contributed and testified secretly to Congress to produce the report.
[00:48:26.319 --> 00:48:27.259]  They know what's in it.
[00:48:27.939 --> 00:48:37.522]  A NORAD stand-down, an FAA stand-down, six-month stand-down from California to Florida, from Texas to Arizona, to Minneapolis, St.
[00:48:37.582 --> 00:48:46.325]  Paul, to Oklahoma, with hijackers, at least three other teams, not just the team that was involved in 9-11, decoy teams, I believe the main team was a decoy as well,
[00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:48.210]  From the evidence we have.
[00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:51.753]  The only real air phone calls are about gas and people being gassed.
[00:48:52.473 --> 00:48:53.674]  And we have them!
[00:48:55.536 --> 00:48:57.077]  Ordering the stand down of the FBI.
[00:48:57.397 --> 00:48:59.699]  We have the Deputy FBI Director quitting over it.
[00:49:01.541 --> 00:49:06.665]  Okay, there is a May 14, 2008 Op-Ed News, Rumsfeld Mind.
[00:49:06.705 --> 00:49:08.767]  If 9-11 worked, why not try it again?
[00:49:08.807 --> 00:49:09.487]  Let's scroll down.
[00:49:10.948 --> 00:49:12.510]  I don't believe that's it.
[00:49:13.991 --> 00:49:15.612]  Because we need the audio and there's video.
[00:49:15.652 --> 00:49:16.353]  I'm going to find it.
[00:49:17.498 --> 00:49:17.878]  It doesn't matter.
[00:49:17.898 --> 00:49:18.839]  Our listeners will find it.
[00:49:18.859 --> 00:49:19.459]  Great job, guys.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:20.780]  There it is.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.581]  Rumsfeld on 2006 election.
[00:49:22.941 --> 00:49:24.642]  The correction for that is an attack.
[00:49:25.802 --> 00:49:29.484]  Yeah, see if that's the one that has the actual audio in it, because I'm going to say it again.
[00:49:29.504 --> 00:49:44.452]  Audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio, audio,
[00:49:44.952 --> 00:49:51.496]  Because, see, we have a criminal group that's taking over the country that launched terror attacks and is bringing in giant sleeper cells right now to launch more.
[00:49:52.036 --> 00:50:01.702]  And when I expose that they're behind it, they'll say I'm saying there's not an Islamic threat when I'm saying there's traitors in our government at the globalist Hydra-Spectre level that are running it.
[00:50:02.162 --> 00:50:04.684]  The hour-long audio clip was found as part of a data dump.
[00:50:04.724 --> 00:50:05.284]  There, we have it.
[00:50:06.265 --> 00:50:06.685]  We found it.
[00:50:06.705 --> 00:50:07.986]  And it's all over YouTube.
[00:50:08.006 --> 00:50:08.546]  It's everywhere.
[00:50:08.566 --> 00:50:08.846]  Good.
[00:50:09.226 --> 00:50:09.366]  Good.
[00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:10.667]  So we found the article that has it.
[00:50:10.927 --> 00:50:11.808]  Pull it back up, please.
[00:50:13.326 --> 00:50:14.587]  That's the problem with 9-11.
[00:50:14.727 --> 00:50:16.147]  People say, get into 9-11 Truth again.
[00:50:16.467 --> 00:50:18.888]  I go crazy when I do because there's mountains of it.
[00:50:19.169 --> 00:50:20.369]  It's total smoking gun.
[00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:27.572]  The hour-long audio clip was found as part of a data dump by the Pentagon in response to the New York Times Freedom of Information Act request.
[00:50:27.932 --> 00:50:29.293]  The Huffington Post article reports.
[00:50:29.613 --> 00:50:34.775]  Now, let's scroll back up to the top and I'll give folks the actual article headline so people can find it and then go get the clip.
[00:50:35.075 --> 00:50:36.956]  And the clip's probably been moved or whatever, but we'll get it.
[00:50:40.595 --> 00:50:41.517]  Rumsfeld's mind.
[00:50:41.557 --> 00:50:43.000]  If 9-11 worked, why not try it again?
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:43.882]  We're gonna find that audio.
[00:50:43.922 --> 00:50:44.843]  It's devastating.
[00:50:45.625 --> 00:50:46.286]  Devastating.
[00:50:51.889 --> 00:50:53.690]  By the way, don't forget we're lizard supported.

[00:51:25.643 --> 00:51:28.924]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?

[00:53:29.767 --> 00:53:36.174]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:53:36.414 --> 00:53:37.235]  This is sustainable.
[00:53:37.355 --> 00:53:41.339]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:53:41.539 --> 00:53:44.723]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:53:45.043 --> 00:53:47.805]  He's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:53:47.845 --> 00:53:55.070]  We're looking at the television screen for research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.

[00:54:15.876 --> 00:54:25.083]  For the full second hour, Billy Corgan will be in the studio talking about the trance that the world population, not just the United States, is laboring under.
[00:54:26.904 --> 00:54:32.389]  But I want to play this clip of Donald Trump, who came out six months ago and talked about the 28 pages, two months ago and did it.
[00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:34.610]  The media said he was insane, just making it up.
[00:54:35.051 --> 00:54:39.154]  It didn't exist, even though the families were having press conferences on C-SPAN.
[00:54:40.908 --> 00:54:47.560]  And then a little bird told me over the weekend that he would be coming out this week big time with it again.
[00:54:49.505 --> 00:54:52.187]  I tell you, it is great to talk to little birds.
[00:54:53.207 --> 00:55:07.875]  It is really amazing that I have to sit here and keep my mouth shut about all the stuff I know, but let me just tell you, they've got every dumbed-down moron group out there calling for Trump's death, you name it, because he wants to bring jobs back and wants them to have a future, and he knows vaccines are dangerous.
[00:55:07.936 --> 00:55:09.016]  One of his kids got hurt by it.
[00:55:09.156 --> 00:55:10.137]  That's not known.
[00:55:10.777 --> 00:55:11.778]  I'm just going to shut up right now.
[00:55:12.498 --> 00:55:18.243]  I just cannot believe that they've dumbed the public down, that they almost don't even deserve freedom.
[00:55:18.764 --> 00:55:19.324]  But you know what?
[00:55:19.484 --> 00:55:20.285]  They're victims.
[00:55:20.545 --> 00:55:21.826]  They've been induced into it.
[00:55:22.046 --> 00:55:25.749]  So they need a chance to see the truth, and then reject it before judgment.
[00:55:27.411 --> 00:55:34.137]  Let's go ahead and go to Donald Trump on Fox & Friends, saying release the 28 pages that the media two months ago said didn't exist.
[00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:37.499]  And of course, when I exposed it 14 years ago, they said it didn't exist either.
[00:55:37.539 --> 00:55:37.840]  Here it is.
[00:55:38.536 --> 00:55:38.756]  I do.
[00:55:38.776 --> 00:55:40.638]  I think we should have seen it a long time ago.
[00:55:40.658 --> 00:55:42.580]  I think I know what it's going to say.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.200]  It's going to be very
[00:55:59.675 --> 00:56:06.457]  Very profound, having to do with Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia's role on the World Trade Center and the attack.
[00:56:07.117 --> 00:56:08.978]  And that's very serious stuff.
[00:56:09.198 --> 00:56:11.939]  And, you know, again, I've said it for a long time.
[00:56:12.279 --> 00:56:13.359]  We attacked Iraq.
[00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:18.141]  And frankly, by attacking Iraq, they were not the ones that knocked down the World Trade Center.
[00:56:18.161 --> 00:56:19.541]  Now, I've been saying that for a long time.
[00:56:19.801 --> 00:56:21.062]  Let's see what the papers say.
[00:56:21.442 --> 00:56:23.583]  I think they should have been released a long time ago.
[00:56:23.623 --> 00:56:27.144]  I think they're finally going to be, at least in some form, released.
[00:56:28.024 --> 00:56:38.167]  You know, it's sort of nice to know who your friends are and perhaps who your enemies are, but you're going to see some very revealing things in those papers, and I look forward to reading them.
[00:56:38.247 --> 00:56:40.007]  Yeah, and people say, well, that's not all the story.
[00:56:40.047 --> 00:56:40.788]  It doesn't matter.
[00:56:40.908 --> 00:56:42.228]  It will bring the globalists down.
[00:56:43.168 --> 00:56:45.329]  It will expose false flags in Europe.
[00:56:46.429 --> 00:56:47.429]  It goes on and on.
[00:56:47.449 --> 00:56:52.911]  I mean, it is like a Christmas sweater that has that one string that you pull it, it pulls it all out.
[00:56:52.951 --> 00:56:54.391]  That's why they've always been so scared of it.
[00:56:55.231 --> 00:56:56.572]  Now, again, are we vindicated?
[00:56:57.546 --> 00:56:58.547]  Did I tell you first?
[00:56:59.608 --> 00:57:02.229]  I'm proudest of the fact that I went through hell to tell the truth.
[00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:04.451]  And I lost so much, but I gained so much.
[00:57:05.352 --> 00:57:06.713]  Thank God I had integrity.
[00:57:07.393 --> 00:57:12.197]  And I'm not bragging about it, it's just that we told you the truth, specifically.
[00:57:13.157 --> 00:57:14.318]  And we were right all along.
[00:57:14.758 --> 00:57:18.741]  And our whistleblowers, who are the real champions, and you the listeners, I salute you.
[00:57:19.402 --> 00:57:26.327]  Now I'm going to come back and play a pro-gun piece that we've got before Billy Corgan comes in, because I want to talk to him some before he gets in, because he just got here.
[00:57:27.864 --> 00:57:36.087]  And then I want to play also this top-linked story on DrudgeReport.com that deals with folks threatening in these rap videos to kill Trump.
[00:57:36.767 --> 00:57:38.328]  They don't even know who Trump really is.
[00:57:38.608 --> 00:57:41.008]  They don't know he wants China to stop cheating Americans.
[00:57:41.509 --> 00:57:51.172]  He doesn't know that he's told black Americans he wants to absolutely focus on them because they've been particularly screwed over bringing jobs into their communities, high-paying $30-$40 manufacturing jobs.
[00:57:51.432 --> 00:57:51.932]  It doesn't matter.
[00:57:52.112 --> 00:57:53.933]  MTV owned by Sumner Redstone.
[00:57:54.533 --> 00:57:57.014]  I've talked to folks high-level at MTV, multiple angles.
[00:57:57.594 --> 00:58:04.137]  Where they were told in the 90s, we're getting rid of rock, rid of all this stuff, we want to bring gangster rap to take over the communities and enslave people, and they did it.
[00:58:04.678 --> 00:58:16.204]  So a guy that weaponized gangster rap, the number one killer of black people after abortion, to destroy their culture, and that very same Sumner Redstone tells them Donald Trump's the enemy, and promotes stuff like this.
[00:58:17.506 --> 00:58:19.570]  Alright, we'll talk about that with Billy Corgan as well.
[00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:22.294]  So it's all coming up in the second hour.
[00:58:22.855 --> 00:58:25.680]  And Andrew Wakefield is also already here, so it's coming up.
[00:58:26.141 --> 00:58:28.465]  Just don't forget, folks, I get so busy I don't even plug.
[00:58:29.106 --> 00:58:30.628]  Last day, I'm extending it one day.
[00:58:31.957 --> 00:58:36.199]  Because we have enough to do it, and then still have enough for a month before more comes in, of Brain Force.

[00:58:51.428 --> 00:58:52.309]  Hillary for prison shirts.

[00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:54.790]  Second hour, stay with us.

[00:58:58.032 --> 00:58:58.793]  Infowars.com.com.
[00:59:01.494 --> 00:59:10.504]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:59:10.585 --> 00:59:18.674]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:59:18.974 --> 00:59:23.677]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:59:23.837 --> 00:59:30.581]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:30.641 --> 00:59:37.726]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:59:37.826 --> 00:59:44.670]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:49.193]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:59:49.314 --> 00:59:52.576]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:59:52.716 --> 00:59:58.841]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:59:59.021 --> 01:00:01.243]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:00:03.645 --> 01:00:06.247]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:10.871 --> 01:00:17.584]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:00:17.845 --> 01:00:19.929]  You better believe you got one!
[01:00:40.795 --> 01:00:54.679]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[01:00:54.879 --> 01:01:00.581]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[01:01:01.977 --> 01:01:03.857]  We just have to be repetitive about this.
[01:01:03.917 --> 01:01:08.578]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:15.380]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:15.760]  Enough.
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:16.600]  Enough.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:17.400]  Enough.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:18.340]  Enough.
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:19.820]  Mayor Bloomberg, how you doing?
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.921]  Jason, I grew up in Brooklyn.
[01:01:20.981 --> 01:01:24.321]  In the spirit of gun control, will you disarm your entire security team?
[01:01:24.941 --> 01:01:26.802]  Uh, you will get back to me.
[01:01:26.822 --> 01:01:27.522]  You'll get back to me?
[01:01:36.754 --> 01:01:41.035]  They may feel that it's part of a romanticized culture.
[01:01:41.756 --> 01:01:45.677]  There's an aspect of this, a kind of Wild West, cowboy, Dirty Harry aspect.
[01:01:45.877 --> 01:01:48.618]  There's also an aspect... So they're macho men and they gotta have a gun?
[01:01:48.718 --> 01:01:49.258]  Go ahead.
[01:01:50.298 --> 01:01:51.198]  Make my day.
[01:01:51.538 --> 01:01:53.039]  Anybody that wants to disarm me...
[01:01:55.330 --> 01:01:59.732]  A trio of would-be burglars picked the wrong Albuquerque house to break into.
[01:01:59.892 --> 01:02:07.475]  Police say when the three teens pried open the door, a brave little girl was waiting for them, locked and loaded.
[01:02:07.755 --> 01:02:11.057]  It's harder to use an assault weapon than to hit something that is a shotgun, okay?
[01:02:20.569 --> 01:02:21.830]  You don't need an AR-15.
[01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:24.253]  It's harder to aim.
[01:02:24.633 --> 01:02:25.834]  It's harder to use.
[01:02:31.339 --> 01:02:34.583]  In fact, you don't need 30 rounds to protect yourself.
[01:02:35.183 --> 01:02:35.824]  Buy a shotgun.
[01:02:37.313 --> 01:02:37.993]  Why shotgun?
[01:02:38.474 --> 01:02:54.520]  Vice President Biden and I had a meeting with a group of technology people and talked about how guns can be made more safe by making them either through fingerprint identification, the gun talks to a bracelet or something that you might wear.
[01:02:54.781 --> 01:03:00.123]  Anybody that wants to make me unarmed and helpless, people that want to literally create the proven
[01:03:01.238 --> 01:03:06.342]  Places where more innocents are killed, called gun-free zones, we're gonna beat you.
[01:03:06.542 --> 01:03:09.404]  We're gonna vote you out of office, or suck on my machine gun.
[01:03:09.444 --> 01:03:16.669]  That's why you're going to fail, and the establishment knows, no matter how much propaganda, the republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:17.630]  Guns will be taken.
[01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:18.871]  No one will be able to be armed.
[01:03:19.151 --> 01:03:20.052]  We will take all weapons.
[01:03:20.372 --> 01:03:27.837]  I believe that as Americans, we have a right to arm ourselves against criminals, but we don't need the ability to arm ourselves against the army.
[01:03:29.518 --> 01:03:30.079]  Or the police.
[01:03:31.693 --> 01:03:33.614]  The United States military is not out to get us.
[01:03:33.814 --> 01:03:38.315]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[01:03:38.415 --> 01:03:42.456]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[01:03:42.476 --> 01:03:52.419]  The Second Amendment is there, and it was put in there not for hunting and fishing, like they like to say, because back when they did it, if you didn't hunt or fish, you didn't eat.
[01:03:52.999 --> 01:04:02.562]  It was put in there so the citizens would have the ability, if their government became oppressive, they could defend themselves against oppressive government.
[01:04:02.802 --> 01:04:14.545]  Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns, Fidel Castro took the guns, Hugo Chavez took the guns, and I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:04:15.266 --> 01:04:19.727]  I'm the hootness, tootness, shootness, Bobtail Wildcat in the West!
[01:04:21.194 --> 01:04:23.015]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[01:04:23.476 --> 01:04:29.800]  I wouldn't feel comfortable having an argument with him in his home where he had access to his 50 weapons.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:35.984]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally, and pop him.
[01:04:36.264 --> 01:04:37.585]  I'd love to see that.
[01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:38.285]  In uniform.
[01:04:41.775 --> 01:04:45.640]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:50.005]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:50.085 --> 01:04:54.771]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down.
[01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:57.214]  If you want them, come and take them!
[01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:01.856]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live on this Tuesday.
[01:05:01.956 --> 01:05:03.636]  Billy Corgan is in studio with us.
[01:05:03.816 --> 01:05:05.196]  We'll be back straight ahead.
[01:05:05.696 --> 01:05:09.477]  Tell your friends and family, whether it's on AM, FM, TV, the internet, tune in.
[01:05:09.637 --> 01:05:10.577]  The real power you have.
[01:05:11.118 --> 01:05:12.518]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:05:12.758 --> 01:05:14.058]  You can't survive without it.
[01:05:14.238 --> 01:05:15.178]  But where do you get it?
[01:05:15.458 --> 01:05:21.220]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:27.161]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:05:27.341 --> 01:05:44.208]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:05:44.608 --> 01:05:46.728]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:05:47.089 --> 01:05:48.289]  Stainless steel construction.
[01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:49.349]  Easy assembly.
[01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:50.229]  Low maintenance.

[01:07:09.396 --> 01:07:13.740]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.142]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:07:16.302 --> 01:07:24.610]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:07:24.930 --> 01:07:28.272]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[01:07:28.432 --> 01:07:38.878]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:07:39.078 --> 01:07:46.362]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:48.423]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:07:48.783 --> 01:07:56.446]  Supermail Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:07:56.746 --> 01:08:02.908]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:08:03.208 --> 01:08:10.150]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Supermail Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:08:28.817 --> 01:08:35.203]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:08:35.303 --> 01:08:36.784]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:08:53.628 --> 01:08:56.171]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[01:08:56.471 --> 01:08:59.434]  We are now well into the second hour.
[01:08:59.474 --> 01:09:02.377]  We'll be here until three o'clock Central Standard Time today.
[01:09:02.397 --> 01:09:04.360]  David Knight hosts the fourth hour.
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:08.864]  Now until about 15 after next hour, Billy Corgan is our guest in studio.
[01:09:09.205 --> 01:09:12.749]  And then we have Dr. Andrew Wakefield, a true hero.
[01:09:13.843 --> 01:09:14.283]  Coming on.
[01:09:14.883 --> 01:09:22.066]  He has been vindicated that autism is majorly connected to infections in the gut.
[01:09:22.846 --> 01:09:24.227]  And that's even in the New York Times.
[01:09:24.287 --> 01:09:31.450]  And it turns out the British government did two studies previously that they classified that found the same thing that Dr. Wakefield
[01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:32.470]  I think so.
[01:09:52.925 --> 01:09:58.228]  And Robert De Niro said a high-level government official personally threatened him, but that everyone should see the film.
[01:09:58.828 --> 01:10:02.249]  So we're going to be talking about what vaccines are really doing.
[01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:03.890]  This is social control.
[01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:05.171]  This is social engineering.
[01:10:05.711 --> 01:10:07.132]  We have the CDC documents.
[01:10:07.232 --> 01:10:07.932]  They're scared.
[01:10:08.192 --> 01:10:12.854]  And just like the 9-11 Commission, and just like the Congressional Commission, is suppressing the 28 pages.
[01:10:14.434 --> 01:10:15.014]  Doesn't matter.
[01:10:15.495 --> 01:10:19.638]  Folks that have read it are going public, like Congressman Jones, Senator Graham, and others.
[01:10:19.678 --> 01:10:20.379]  Bipartisan.
[01:10:20.759 --> 01:10:26.643]  And our government stood down with Saudi Arabia, with the Bushes, and bare minimum allowed the attacks to take place.
[01:10:27.004 --> 01:10:32.168]  The Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States, his family, his wife,
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:37.041]  For years, was giving money transfers to the hijackers, who themselves were decoys.
[01:10:37.401 --> 01:10:39.121]  But the point is, it's all coming down.
[01:10:39.141 --> 01:10:41.882]  I was just talking to Billy Corgan, who is a super smart guy.
[01:10:41.902 --> 01:10:42.722]  I'm not being patronizing.
[01:10:42.742 --> 01:10:43.582]  Everybody knows he is.
[01:10:43.942 --> 01:10:46.823]  He doesn't give a lot of interviews because mainstream media is dying.
[01:10:47.603 --> 01:10:48.643]  He wants to talk about that today.
[01:10:49.623 --> 01:10:50.843]  They twist everything you do.
[01:10:50.883 --> 01:10:56.104]  They're a bunch of critics, snots that hate artists and people that, quite frankly, are smarter than them.
[01:10:56.364 --> 01:10:58.325]  And that's what social justice warrior crap is.
[01:10:59.281 --> 01:11:11.050]  It is the elite turning loose on the real intellectuals and artists and liberals, real liberals, turning loose, basically fascists that call themselves liberals, to attack anyone that gets outside the lines.
[01:11:12.912 --> 01:11:13.973]  And that's what's been happening.
[01:11:13.993 --> 01:11:15.254]  We've talked a lot about it behind the scenes.
[01:11:15.274 --> 01:11:20.778]  You've told me amazing stuff that I've talked to top executives that if they've confirmed, talked to other big rock stars, they've said, yeah, no, that's true.
[01:11:21.499 --> 01:11:22.760]  But you're one of the only people
[01:11:23.677 --> 01:11:25.218]  Because they go after Dave Mustaine.
[01:11:25.258 --> 01:11:27.180]  He had courage, but notice he hadn't been political in a while.
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:27.900]  I talk to him all the time.
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:28.260]  Great guy.
[01:11:28.721 --> 01:11:32.543]  You still go public, even though when you come on, they come after you in hundreds of publications.
[01:11:32.824 --> 01:11:33.985]  But they're out of bullets.
[01:11:34.025 --> 01:11:34.745]  They're discredited.
[01:11:34.765 --> 01:11:35.446]  I mean, it's an honor.
[01:11:35.846 --> 01:11:40.669]  So I'm going to try to shut up, because I get really excited when we hang out, because your energy level is really good, and it resonates with me.
[01:11:41.892 --> 01:11:48.396]  To talk about the state of the world, but you were really, during the last five minutes when we were on break, crystallizing so much.
[01:11:48.416 --> 01:11:49.717]  So I don't want to repeat what you said.
[01:11:49.737 --> 01:11:58.963]  I want to give you the floor, Lee Corrigan, to break down, here in studio, in Austin, Texas, founder of Smashing Pumpkins, so many other successful bands, what is it, 40 million albums sold?
[01:11:59.663 --> 01:12:02.345]  You've got SmashingPumpkinsNexus.com.
[01:12:03.446 --> 01:12:11.051]  Just, you know, really, the last decade exposing global tyranny, or longer, you've been doing this for more than two decades,
[01:12:12.426 --> 01:12:15.609]  Where are we currently, in your view, as a species?
[01:12:15.729 --> 01:12:16.569]  Where is the planet?
[01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:22.014]  Why is everybody talking about the fact that they see a quickening happening?
[01:12:24.015 --> 01:12:26.517]  That's A. And then B, you said, look, I'm on a mission.
[01:12:26.557 --> 01:12:27.738]  This is what I want to talk about today.
[01:12:27.758 --> 01:12:28.459]  So you've got the floor.
[01:12:28.619 --> 01:12:29.119]  Great to see you.
[01:12:29.379 --> 01:12:29.760]  Thank you, bud.
[01:12:32.213 --> 01:12:33.074]  I don't know how to follow that.
[01:12:34.555 --> 01:12:35.136]  You're so kind.
[01:12:35.756 --> 01:12:36.377]  Let's start here.
[01:12:37.718 --> 01:12:51.410]  For a while I've been thinking about making a documentary about America and it went from an idea that was maybe going to go with the Pumpkins album to now we're talking about trying to find a partner to make it a sort of a series and what's like the new model of television like the eight part
[01:12:52.253 --> 01:12:59.479]  You know, like the, you know, there's that, everybody's talking about the making of a murder, you know, it's like the kind of new version of TV.
[01:12:59.539 --> 01:13:02.622]  It's like binge watching a part, you know, so we're looking at that model.
[01:13:02.722 --> 01:13:05.764]  So that's exciting because that takes it out of the typical 90 minute thing.
[01:13:06.325 --> 01:13:20.877]  So I traveled across the country in an RV writing songs with a buddy of mine who's a vet, two tours of Iraq, and another friend of mine is a professional wrestler, good friends, and went around and interviewed a bunch of people about America and tried to have a conversation with people above
[01:13:21.724 --> 01:13:30.650]  The political discourse and above the cultural discourse, which is very, very difficult because the way most people relate these days is it starts with Obama this or Trump that.
[01:13:31.431 --> 01:13:34.053]  Or did you see what so-and-so said about somebody else?
[01:13:34.613 --> 01:13:40.077]  Getting people to talk about America from a heartful point of view, their ancestors, which you talk about a lot.
[01:13:40.257 --> 01:13:42.518]  You've inspired me along that path too.
[01:13:43.519 --> 01:13:51.862]  To talk about their feelings about how they view America and whether the America that they grew up believing in or not believing in is real or was it ever real.
[01:13:52.302 --> 01:14:02.466]  And what I found, it was really fascinating because I talked to people from every type of background, that most Americans have a very shared conception of what America means.
[01:14:03.087 --> 01:14:06.368]  And the two things that I heard over and over again were opportunity and hard work.
[01:14:07.216 --> 01:14:08.917]  That's something they learned from their ancestors.
[01:14:09.077 --> 01:14:10.198]  That's our ethos.
[01:14:10.378 --> 01:14:13.039]  That is in the American DNA, I would argue.
[01:14:13.399 --> 01:14:26.646]  And so, what is often classified as a racial component, or a class component, is antithetical to the foundation of the country, is, we came here to build something that was literally an opportunity.
[01:14:27.106 --> 01:14:34.210]  Now, when you say that, of course there are people, you know, start with the Native Americans, you know, who were disenfranchised along the way.
[01:14:34.890 --> 01:14:38.053]  So, that vision of opportunity has continued to grow.
[01:14:38.393 --> 01:14:43.957]  And now we've reached another critical mass point in our nation's history, where is the line of expansion?
[01:14:44.498 --> 01:14:52.324]  In terms of immigration, in terms of tolerance, in terms of welcoming, in terms of welfare sustainability, where are the lines?
[01:14:52.764 --> 01:14:54.986]  So, talking about that more in the symbolic
[01:14:56.948 --> 01:14:59.233]  250 plus year arc of the country.
[01:14:59.293 --> 01:15:01.317]  So transcending the divide and conquer.
[01:15:01.357 --> 01:15:01.598]  Yes.
[01:15:02.941 --> 01:15:03.442]  Jamming.
[01:15:03.742 --> 01:15:04.203]  Absolutely.
[01:15:04.504 --> 01:15:05.466]  And it's amazing.
[01:15:05.867 --> 01:15:06.308]  Amazing.
[01:15:07.153 --> 01:15:16.576]  How when you talk to, and I would encourage anyone to have these discussions with themselves, when you talk about what America really means to them, there's a lot of love left in people's hearts for this country.
[01:15:16.776 --> 01:15:17.696]  That surprised me.
[01:15:18.516 --> 01:15:22.558]  Because the general feeling is we're a nation in decline and we're about to go boom.
[01:15:22.598 --> 01:15:24.098]  You talk to some people and they don't think that.
[01:15:24.318 --> 01:15:26.439]  They think this is just another, you know,
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:29.521]  You're bumping the road.
[01:15:45.478 --> 01:15:47.359]  Yeah, they talk about the bad things in America's past.
[01:15:47.399 --> 01:15:49.560]  Well, yeah, but you compare it to other systems.
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:51.241]  We had the most opportunity.
[01:15:51.281 --> 01:15:52.662]  We were the most rebellious.
[01:15:53.002 --> 01:15:54.443]  We were the most trailblazing.
[01:15:54.463 --> 01:15:57.164]  It didn't mean it was great, but compared to everything else, it was wonderful.
[01:15:57.505 --> 01:16:04.809]  Where you were born into your caste in Italy, or in Japan, or in China, or in Germany, or wherever you came from, or Brazil.
[01:16:06.109 --> 01:16:11.134]  You had to get here where you could get out of the cast and really show who you were.
[01:16:11.154 --> 01:16:11.955]  I mean, let's take music.
[01:16:11.995 --> 01:16:19.142]  If you weren't from a rich, powerful family 200 years ago, 300 years ago in Europe, it didn't matter how good you were, you weren't going to get to write music and ever have it heard.
[01:16:20.734 --> 01:16:23.835]  I would still argue that we are that country.
[01:16:25.276 --> 01:16:26.616]  And this is something you and I talk about.
[01:16:26.716 --> 01:16:29.718]  I think that you're fantastic.
[01:16:30.178 --> 01:16:32.819]  You often use the analogy of being the bomber over the target.
[01:16:33.259 --> 01:16:34.079]  So you're looking down.
[01:16:34.359 --> 01:16:36.680]  You see things people don't see from that vantage point.
[01:16:37.101 --> 01:16:40.302]  You've invested a lot in understanding how to read those things.
[01:16:41.242 --> 01:16:48.725]  Your military sources, your political sources, the Roger Stones, they can give you that bird's eye read just like I can give you the bird's eye read of culture, right?
[01:16:49.506 --> 01:16:50.246]  Or inside MTV.
[01:16:51.567 --> 01:16:52.027]  You name it.
[01:16:52.107 --> 01:16:53.248]  I mean, been there, done that.
[01:16:54.588 --> 01:17:12.195]  So, and what I would say is, and where we can be helpful, I think, is when you talk about pan-national corporations, you know, if you're in the tech world right now, your sandbox is the whole world.
[01:17:13.375 --> 01:17:14.896]  You're not stopping at somebody's border.
[01:17:15.868 --> 01:17:24.897]  And this is why even starting five, seven years ago, you started seeing those tech companies start cutting deals with communists and fascists and whatever type of governments.
[01:17:26.018 --> 01:17:27.659]  Censoring, being willing to do whatever.
[01:17:27.899 --> 01:17:29.161]  Because that's their playing field.
[01:17:29.401 --> 01:17:33.104]  Now they'll sit there and wink and say, you know, we're gonna democratize the world.
[01:17:33.965 --> 01:17:38.249]  I think most people, and particularly Iran, know that's a bunch of BS.
[01:17:38.610 --> 01:17:40.692]  This is capitalism at its raw power best.
[01:17:41.758 --> 01:17:44.260]  You can play it however you want, you can see however you want.
[01:17:45.021 --> 01:17:46.322]  Who's got a bigger gun?
[01:17:46.362 --> 01:17:48.404]  Who's got more cojones at the table?
[01:17:48.424 --> 01:17:55.490]  That's right, the globalists use capitalism when it expands their power, but then at the grassroots they want communism, just like Obama said in Argentina.
[01:17:55.991 --> 01:18:00.294]  He said, oh, multinationally we're going to have capitalism, locally we're going to have communism.
[01:18:00.455 --> 01:18:07.581]  I mean, when you have the President of the United States telling people in another country, use whatever political system works, I mean, that was a laughable moment.
[01:18:09.164 --> 01:18:14.207]  You sent me a couple articles dealing with this, how President Obama is quote, scared of Google.
[01:18:15.154 --> 01:18:35.047]  Well, there was an article, I think you guys maybe even ran it the other day, about a movie producer, a gentleman who was a Expendables 3, and he basically has come out and said, why is the Obama government, which is a liberal government, very in bed with Hollywood, why are they not going after the systems that help exploit movies and disenfranchise people who've invested a lot of money to make the movies?
[01:18:35.327 --> 01:18:37.908]  Not to mention the crews and everything and all the unions involved.
[01:18:38.109 --> 01:18:39.289]  Why are they not protecting those people?
[01:18:39.569 --> 01:18:43.192]  Because the tech companies look the other way on the illegal downloading of materials.
[01:18:43.672 --> 01:18:48.641]  We have the technology right now to stop the transfer of illegal music or pirated music and pirated movies.
[01:18:48.841 --> 01:18:49.542]  They could do that tomorrow.
[01:18:49.983 --> 01:18:50.524]  Why don't they do it?
[01:18:50.905 --> 01:18:51.766]  They put a code in it?
[01:18:51.806 --> 01:18:52.768]  The device has the code?
[01:18:52.788 --> 01:18:53.850]  It either lets it or not.
[01:18:54.090 --> 01:18:55.753]  I have a quick funny story.
[01:18:56.832 --> 01:19:06.662]  I've uploaded my own songs to, you know, something and it'll be deleted because I don't have the right to do it because they have some automatic system that identifies the song and takes it down.
[01:19:07.283 --> 01:19:08.324]  I can't even put up my own music.
[01:19:09.065 --> 01:19:15.952]  Now if they have systems in play to shut down my own music and there's not a system there to identify that it's my music to use, you think they can't stop somebody from...
[01:19:16.912 --> 01:19:21.973]  I mean, yeah, some kid in the dark web can find it, but most users are not sophisticated tech users.
[01:19:22.313 --> 01:19:23.914]  You know, they press a button, it works or it doesn't.
[01:19:24.574 --> 01:19:28.815]  I said I wouldn't do this, but I'm skipping this one network break so we get more time with Billy here today.
[01:19:28.835 --> 01:19:31.896]  I know that causes them headaches, but we're going to skip this network break right now.
[01:19:32.296 --> 01:19:36.137]  For some stations out there, most stations do end up carrying all because this is a network break.
[01:19:36.217 --> 01:19:37.417]  Billy Corgan is our guest.
[01:19:37.857 --> 01:19:41.778]  We've got the website smashingpumpkinsnexus.com.
[01:19:42.678 --> 01:19:44.879]  Thematically, though, let's put this out there.
[01:19:46.055 --> 01:19:50.499]  I mean, repeating what you said in the five minutes we talked before we went on air, you talked about, I said, why are you here?
[01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:52.501]  Well, like you talk about, we want to break the trance.
[01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:54.803]  How do we talk to people that are in the trance?
[01:19:55.223 --> 01:20:02.510]  And you're basically saying, transcend all the current labels and things, talk about ancestors, talk about larger themes of humanity and destiny.
[01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:09.436]  Let's get into where you think the world is at this current place and where you think we're going and how do we transcend
[01:20:10.177 --> 01:20:15.481]  The scientific admitted mind war that the big corporations and governments admit they're using.
[01:20:15.521 --> 01:20:15.842]  Perfect.
[01:20:16.342 --> 01:20:17.023]  Okay, let's start here.
[01:20:17.883 --> 01:20:21.226]  When somebody's lying to you, they have two choices when you call them out on the lie.
[01:20:21.406 --> 01:20:24.709]  They either lie more or they admit it and then you deal with the damage from there.
[01:20:25.269 --> 01:20:33.275]  So what you've done and many other people have done, and of course there's, you talk to people in the entertainment community who are usually pretty awake because they're inside these systems.
[01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:42.284]  We're at the point now where either the lie is going to be triple, quadruple, double, you know, whatever, on downed on, or it's going to break and we're going to deal with the fallout here.
[01:20:42.805 --> 01:20:46.048]  And the election has now become the critical mass point.
[01:20:46.068 --> 01:20:46.589]  The catalyst.
[01:20:46.929 --> 01:20:51.373]  When you see the forces at play, I'll use your term, uncloaking,
[01:20:52.199 --> 01:21:00.481]  I mean brazen, brazen robbing of people's ability to cast their vote in a primary.
[01:21:00.521 --> 01:21:09.423]  When you see brazen disregard of polls, when you see an AP thing that came out yesterday, 6% trust in the media.
[01:21:09.683 --> 01:21:16.265]  What business model in the world would take a 6% approval rating and keep doing the same thing that they're doing?
[01:21:18.393 --> 01:21:19.193]  I mean, unbelievable.
[01:21:19.513 --> 01:21:21.955]  Yeah, what restaurant would stay open with a 6% approval rating?
[01:21:22.175 --> 01:21:22.355]  Right.
[01:21:22.615 --> 01:21:23.455]  So what does that tell you?
[01:21:23.775 --> 01:21:26.136]  That says that they're not there to give you the truth.
[01:21:26.256 --> 01:21:29.138]  They are there as a propaganda arm of a much bigger force.
[01:21:29.438 --> 01:21:30.058]  Is it the U.S.
[01:21:30.098 --> 01:21:30.498]  government?
[01:21:30.618 --> 01:21:31.759]  Is it some big tech company?
[01:21:31.899 --> 01:21:32.199]  Who knows?
[01:21:32.219 --> 01:21:32.799]  It doesn't matter.
[01:21:32.839 --> 01:21:34.180]  And they're a facade!
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:38.643]  That's already collapsed, they just can't admit it because that would be to admit defeat.
[01:21:38.723 --> 01:21:40.224]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:21:40.404 --> 01:21:42.766]  The minute they admit the lie, it all crumbles.
[01:21:43.086 --> 01:21:48.590]  So they have to keep just doubling down like a bad gambler who thinks, if I can just hit this one bet, I'm going to win all my money.
[01:21:48.611 --> 01:21:49.891]  So what was the term you used before we went live?
[01:21:49.912 --> 01:21:50.892]  Because it really crystallized it.
[01:21:50.912 --> 01:21:54.335]  You said, I mean, it was more than it's coming to a head, it's peaking, or?
[01:21:54.575 --> 01:21:57.077]  Well, look, the Republican convention is in 90 days.
[01:21:58.098 --> 01:22:00.880]  And that is the zeitgeist moment.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:02.021]  Everybody's got to be there.
[01:22:03.413 --> 01:22:09.340]  I don't know because, listen, we live in a digital construct as much as we, you know, which is why I think you were so pressing in calling this the Info War.
[01:22:09.961 --> 01:22:13.625]  Yes, I mean, boots on the ground in the, sorry, in the literal sense of the word.
[01:22:13.645 --> 01:22:14.746]  How dare you touch that microphone?
[01:22:15.086 --> 01:22:16.728]  Slap it around if you want.
[01:22:17.089 --> 01:22:18.310]  Boots on the ground is what I'm saying.
[01:22:18.330 --> 01:22:20.933]  Corrigan abuses electronics, that's... Sorry, go ahead.
[01:22:21.173 --> 01:22:23.236]  No, no, but I, you know, look, I...
[01:22:24.582 --> 01:22:28.344]  I believe in political dissent when it's focused on real objectives, right?
[01:22:28.664 --> 01:22:36.388]  If you feel like you need to be there to let the world know that you care about something and you want to peacefully be involved in the process, I have no problem with that.
[01:22:36.828 --> 01:22:39.850]  But let's go back to what I think is the more salient point.
[01:22:40.510 --> 01:22:47.098]  Most people, especially listeners to this program, are conversant in the themes that you deal with daily.
[01:22:47.678 --> 01:22:55.707]  The mind control, the propagandizing, the willingness for governments who are supposed to be our elected representatives to literally disregard
[01:22:56.648 --> 01:23:00.071]  Um, poll after poll after poll that says they want this and that.
[01:23:00.151 --> 01:23:07.057]  And they've now reached that point where it's a total wall of lies and they're busy buying armored vehicles and building command bunkers.
[01:23:07.597 --> 01:23:09.339]  I mean, like they know it's all going down.
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:22.370]  So, so if you, if you're on the side of the fence that we're obviously on, which is, this is all very transparent to us, and you accept that probably 25 to 35% of the population is either asleep or doesn't want to be woken up.
[01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:28.353]  So, what can you say to the people who are awake, are engaged, and wonder what they can do?
[01:23:28.433 --> 01:23:40.119]  I think that's the more salient point, and I think that's more helpful, because, um, so I'll start with something that I tell people when I, when I talk to, uh, I, every day I meet with fans before the show, and, and they often ask me, like, what can I do?
[01:23:40.599 --> 01:23:42.380]  You have to stop clicking on things.
[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:46.702]  You have to, you have to, you know, there's a- Stop feeding the propaganda medium.
[01:23:47.162 --> 01:23:47.722]  Right, okay.
[01:23:47.943 --> 01:23:49.604]  There's the old saying, vote with your feet.
[01:23:49.824 --> 01:23:50.624]  Okay, what does that mean?
[01:23:50.885 --> 01:23:52.205]  Vote with your dollars, vote with your time.
[01:23:52.286 --> 01:23:52.506]  Yes.
[01:23:52.926 --> 01:23:56.749]  So, when you click on something that you think is free, it is not free.
[01:23:57.549 --> 01:24:07.055]  You are, in essence, disenfranchising your own power by giving somebody else power because they want you to click on that stupid thing because it actually means something.
[01:24:07.436 --> 01:24:15.261]  Now, that system, as the article came out the other day about BuzzFeed kind of hitting the wall, we're seeing now the fatigue of the clickbait society.
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:17.780]  You know?
[01:24:18.181 --> 01:24:21.966]  I mean, I'm somebody who they make headlines out of the most stupid stuff.
[01:24:22.026 --> 01:24:22.627]  It's unbelievable.
[01:24:22.647 --> 01:24:24.990]  They literally will troll everything I will say and they make headlines.
[01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:27.653]  And I say to people all the time, why do you think they're making headlines?
[01:24:27.873 --> 01:24:34.141]  They're using me as a... I wish you'd tell people, because I know you're a really private guy, some of the inside baseball you told me because I've talked to so many other big rock stars.
[01:24:34.722 --> 01:24:42.367]  From the early 90s, mid 90s, when you all get called in, they tell you the new direction, you and a few others say hell no, and then suddenly they won't play you.
[01:24:42.407 --> 01:24:48.011]  I mean, it literally comes down to that level of control with people that won't sell out the system.
[01:24:48.291 --> 01:24:52.494]  Now, that's why I know that George Clooney and all these other people actually know what's going on.
[01:24:53.334 --> 01:24:58.198]  Leonardo DiCaprio, they get up there and say what they're supposed to, or they are blackballed.
[01:24:59.178 --> 01:25:01.480]  Let's look at it from a slightly empathetic point of view.
[01:25:02.581 --> 01:25:04.322]  And I'm not here to say anything about it.
[01:25:04.342 --> 01:25:05.263]  Oh, I'm not bashing them either.
[01:25:05.303 --> 01:25:05.923]  They're slaves.
[01:25:06.364 --> 01:25:07.184]  You're not a slave.
[01:25:07.244 --> 01:25:13.709]  You've stood up for, and been, you're one of the few that's continued to be successful, though, despite their support.
[01:25:13.729 --> 01:25:20.214]  But, I mean, just the last 20 years on air, they just constantly attack you, randomly, for nothing, because they're scared of you.
[01:25:20.959 --> 01:25:21.700]  I don't think it's that.
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:26.603]  I wouldn't go to that level because I don't think that people are that sentient and conscious.
[01:25:26.803 --> 01:25:28.044]  I mean, the minions don't know.
[01:25:28.084 --> 01:25:29.985]  They just know they're green-lighted to attack you.
[01:25:30.185 --> 01:25:30.545]  Well, no.
[01:25:30.726 --> 01:25:31.746]  They're part of a system.
[01:25:32.006 --> 01:25:34.188]  It's like, nobody wants to admit that they're dumb.
[01:25:35.319 --> 01:25:35.539]  Okay.
[01:25:35.759 --> 01:25:36.659]  Nobody wants to admit they're dumb.
[01:25:36.699 --> 01:25:38.100]  Who wants to say, yeah, I'm dumb?
[01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:38.760]  Okay.
[01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:43.981]  Most people in the media do not see themselves as part of some bigger cabal.
[01:25:44.621 --> 01:25:46.541]  They, you know, you used to call them the trendies.
[01:25:46.861 --> 01:25:49.822]  They like to feel they're part of a cool- They're just camp followers.
[01:25:49.842 --> 01:25:51.902]  They're just into this cynical, mean attitude.
[01:25:52.303 --> 01:25:52.463]  Right.
[01:25:52.963 --> 01:25:54.563]  Look, I had an instance the other day.
[01:25:54.583 --> 01:25:56.643]  I haven't talked about this yet.
[01:25:57.064 --> 01:25:58.044]  I was in New York.
[01:25:58.064 --> 01:25:58.904]  I was playing some shows.
[01:25:59.344 --> 01:26:05.793]  And I looked at the table over and there was Michelle Fields, the young woman who is in the whole thing with Corey Lewandowski in the Trump campaign.
[01:26:05.993 --> 01:26:08.036]  And she was sitting there with her boyfriend and I recognized her.
[01:26:09.349 --> 01:26:11.710]  Now it's hard not to stare at somebody when they're in the zeitgeist.
[01:26:11.730 --> 01:26:15.532]  I mean, this woman at that point, whatever it was a week ago, that was when that whole thing was peaking.
[01:26:15.912 --> 01:26:17.213]  Is Lewandowski going to be indicted?
[01:26:17.593 --> 01:26:20.535]  When you look at an actual human being, you know what I'm saying?
[01:26:20.555 --> 01:26:21.235]  You humanize them.
[01:26:21.535 --> 01:26:21.795]  Yes.
[01:26:22.275 --> 01:26:23.456]  She's not a symbol.
[01:26:23.616 --> 01:26:25.577]  She's a young woman sitting there, you know.
[01:26:25.977 --> 01:26:26.758]  She is who she is.
[01:26:26.778 --> 01:26:28.799]  I don't know her.
[01:26:29.139 --> 01:26:31.420]  It's not my moment to judge.
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:34.702]  It's my moment to look and say, there's a real person who has a real belief.
[01:26:35.734 --> 01:26:41.717]  I don't think that's somebody who's walking around feeling, at least this is my own intuition, that they're part of something.
[01:26:43.678 --> 01:26:45.619]  Some master plan.
[01:26:46.219 --> 01:26:47.580]  I don't think it's that sophisticated.
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:49.821]  They like to go with a particular flow.
[01:26:50.421 --> 01:26:51.982]  Sure, she's a drama queen.
[01:26:52.162 --> 01:26:53.262]  She wants to be successful.
[01:26:53.642 --> 01:26:56.664]  He does grab her, so she escalates it and goes along with the hype.
[01:26:57.704 --> 01:26:58.485]  She jumps in the river.
[01:26:59.617 --> 01:27:09.926]  Yes, the opportunity exists to be rewarded for something and they don't realize that they're actually sacrificing themselves at a sort of more satanic altar, just to be a bit dramatic about it.
[01:27:10.426 --> 01:27:13.669]  In essence, you don't realize that you're participation in a particular way.
[01:27:15.086 --> 01:27:16.086]  It's just like clicking.
[01:27:16.626 --> 01:27:18.407]  Yes, if you talk to the individual.
[01:27:18.427 --> 01:27:21.988]  Okay, let's take the most empathetic point of view.
[01:27:22.548 --> 01:27:26.609]  This young woman felt in her heart, in her heart's heart, that she was assaulted.
[01:27:26.909 --> 01:27:27.889]  Okay?
[01:27:27.929 --> 01:27:29.790]  Let's take that as complete truth.
[01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:36.091]  The minute she crossed into certain territories, she becomes somebody else's pawn.
[01:27:37.331 --> 01:27:39.932]  I doubt you could sit her here and she would tell you she's a pawn.
[01:27:40.272 --> 01:27:42.793]  At some point, I woke up and realized that I was a pawn.
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:47.366]  And so my natural human instinct was, I don't want to be anybody's bitch here.
[01:27:47.386 --> 01:27:49.088]  I don't want to be a pawn, excuse my French.
[01:27:49.469 --> 01:27:54.236]  I don't want to participate in something that I know will ultimately hurt my children and their children.
[01:27:54.256 --> 01:27:56.520]  You want to be conscious, free will, not a robot.
[01:27:57.979 --> 01:28:05.623]  So the point is, can you exist truthfully in a system that is set up to disenfranchise you and disempower you at every conceivable level?
[01:28:06.103 --> 01:28:07.423]  So let's take the soccer mom.
[01:28:07.684 --> 01:28:16.147]  She gets up in the morning, she drops the kids off, she comes home, she puts on her iPad, and she's clicking through, and here's Apple sorting all her news.
[01:28:16.267 --> 01:28:19.369]  So she's already, one layer in, is already under control.
[01:28:20.285 --> 01:28:21.806]  Now does that mom think she's being controlled?
[01:28:21.846 --> 01:28:22.167]  Of course not.
[01:28:22.207 --> 01:28:22.447]  No.
[01:28:23.067 --> 01:28:25.810]  What she reads is already being given to her by the New York Times or Apple.
[01:28:26.491 --> 01:28:29.373]  She's already being brought into a world and she doesn't even know it.
[01:28:29.553 --> 01:28:29.693]  Right.
[01:28:29.974 --> 01:28:32.576]  I have friends who all they do is scroll Apple News.
[01:28:33.957 --> 01:28:40.083]  They have no idea that there's sources like you and other people who can give them a different perspective, nor are they curious.
[01:28:41.479 --> 01:28:42.800]  Okay, and so I love it.
[01:28:43.141 --> 01:29:03.198]  I get these people, my friends, you know, they're in my home, and they start spouting literal talking points from the Clinton... Oh, I've had them, I've had liberal family who aren't liberal, you know, they're more just kind of modern, trendy, whatever, over, and they see me on my big iPad Pro or whatever, they're like, oh, iPad Pro, and I'm like, looking at the New York Times and Apple News and Google News, and they go, you read the New York Times?
[01:29:03.599 --> 01:29:05.881]  We thought you were, like, suddenly I was this intellectual.
[01:29:06.201 --> 01:29:07.982]  And I went, I try to look at everything.
[01:29:08.263 --> 01:29:11.125]  This is all sorted to different psychology types.
[01:29:11.505 --> 01:29:14.327]  I also go to Defense One and read what the Pentagon's being told.
[01:29:15.007 --> 01:29:19.991]  And they just go, oh, like you go different places?
[01:29:20.231 --> 01:29:23.753]  I literally, I literally can tell my friends when they come at me with those talking points.
[01:29:23.954 --> 01:29:25.154]  I'm like, oh, you read HuffPo.
[01:29:25.635 --> 01:29:26.235]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:29:26.575 --> 01:29:28.577]  Or you're a BuzzFeed or you're a Reddit.
[01:29:30.461 --> 01:29:35.705]  So, again, taking it back to the street level... Show them how they're... We gotta go to break, but go ahead.
[01:29:36.666 --> 01:29:38.207]  That's the perfect place to leave it.
[01:29:38.227 --> 01:29:39.989]  Alright, I get what you're saying.
[01:29:40.249 --> 01:29:43.252]  Billy Corgan's thought a lot about how to get people out of their trance.
[01:29:43.292 --> 01:29:46.534]  He's talked to millions of fans over the years, hundreds of thousands on the ground.
[01:29:46.935 --> 01:29:49.797]  How do you get people that are already caught in a trance out of it?
[01:29:49.817 --> 01:29:50.878]  How do you break the trance?
[01:29:50.898 --> 01:29:51.519]  I mean, that's the question.
[01:29:51.819 --> 01:29:55.282]  Billy Corgan, how do you break the trance of the modern
[01:29:56.826 --> 01:29:59.568]  The modern sorcerers that have enslaved our planet.
[01:29:59.829 --> 01:30:00.329]  This is key.
[01:30:00.469 --> 01:30:01.390]  We're on the march.
[01:30:01.870 --> 01:30:03.452]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.472 --> 01:30:07.095]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:11.616 --> 01:30:13.058]  My name is Alex Jones.
[01:30:13.518 --> 01:30:19.464]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:30:19.685 --> 01:30:33.859]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights,
[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:36.361]  We're focusing on fighting the globalists.
[01:30:36.762 --> 01:30:44.587]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds and the weight's going off even faster.
[01:30:44.787 --> 01:30:51.892]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[01:30:52.212 --> 01:30:57.916]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[01:30:58.056 --> 01:31:04.240]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:10.287]  Check them out today at Infowarslife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[01:31:11.328 --> 01:31:12.850]  My name is Alex Jones.
[01:31:13.250 --> 01:31:19.177]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[01:31:19.397 --> 01:31:20.539]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:36.105]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[01:31:36.465 --> 01:31:44.288]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[01:31:44.488 --> 01:31:50.931]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels
[01:31:51.351 --> 01:31:51.711]  Let's go!
[01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:15.393]  Get Brain Force at 25% off for a limited time at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:15.513 --> 01:32:17.695]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:32:17.815 --> 01:32:24.639]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:32:24.859 --> 01:32:28.102]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[01:32:28.122 --> 01:32:29.322]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[01:32:29.623 --> 01:32:31.464]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[01:32:31.784 --> 01:32:36.006]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[01:32:36.246 --> 01:32:37.067]  This is sustainable.
[01:32:37.187 --> 01:32:41.169]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[01:32:41.369 --> 01:32:44.530]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:47.672]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[01:32:47.692 --> 01:32:49.172]  We're looking at the television screen.
[01:32:49.192 --> 01:32:54.935]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:32:54.955 --> 01:32:56.256]  You will find brain force.
[01:32:56.576 --> 01:33:02.082]  And other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:02.102 --> 01:33:10.070]  Get Brain Force at 25% off for a limited time at InfoWarsLife.com and we thank you for your support.
[01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:55.459]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:59.869]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:34:02.875 --> 01:34:06.459]  Billy Corgan is our guest in studio, SmashingPumpkinsNexus.com.
[01:34:06.479 --> 01:34:08.822]  He's playing here in Austin, Texas tonight.
[01:34:09.783 --> 01:34:11.685]  And you can also find him on the site where he's going to be playing next.
[01:34:12.085 --> 01:34:14.768]  Really a hard schedule out there to pack houses around the country.
[01:34:15.209 --> 01:34:16.530]  Briefly, we are Lister Supported.
[01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:21.135]  When you buy a Hillary for Prison shirt, you're funding our operation, you're promoting the First Amendment.
[01:34:21.756 --> 01:34:23.657]  Uh, for what she did in Benghazi, the rest of it.
[01:34:23.697 --> 01:34:25.579]  They've tried to intimidate people that speak out against her.
[01:34:25.599 --> 01:34:27.640]  It's important to exercise that free speech.
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:29.702]  Molonwabe, come and take it, shirts.
[01:34:30.262 --> 01:34:36.486]  Uh, we also have, uh, our top nootropic brain force, 45% off retail right now.
[01:34:37.107 --> 01:34:38.088]  And that will end tomorrow.
[01:34:38.108 --> 01:34:39.048]  I'm extending it one day.
[01:34:39.068 --> 01:34:40.089]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:34:40.429 --> 01:34:41.510]  Can I jump in here?
[01:34:41.670 --> 01:34:42.050]  Yeah, sure.
[01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:44.271]  You don't know this, but I use a lot of your products.
[01:34:44.691 --> 01:34:47.012]  I literally couldn't tour like I tour without your products.
[01:34:47.652 --> 01:34:49.593]  I mean, I'm doing a free commercial here.
[01:34:49.913 --> 01:34:50.913]  The products are fantastic.
[01:34:51.014 --> 01:34:51.974]  I didn't know this was going to happen.
[01:34:51.994 --> 01:34:58.576]  Well, please tell folks about them because, look, I set out to come up with the least expensive, super high quality stuff.
[01:34:58.836 --> 01:35:02.258]  I've got three big, top organic firms in the country, you know, the top names.
[01:35:03.138 --> 01:35:04.098]  A threshold, you name it.
[01:35:04.739 --> 01:35:09.100]  And they go, no, nobody else comes to us with formulas with this much stuff in it.
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:10.401]  It's all just about hype.
[01:35:10.741 --> 01:35:12.621]  We want people to put out stuff like this.
[01:35:12.981 --> 01:35:14.962]  And so we really have tried to put out the very best stuff.
[01:35:14.982 --> 01:35:15.802]  What's been your experience?
[01:35:16.583 --> 01:35:18.363]  I use X2 iodine every day.
[01:35:18.503 --> 01:35:19.084]  Fantastic.
[01:35:19.144 --> 01:35:20.624]  Keeps me from getting sick on the road.
[01:35:21.764 --> 01:35:24.205]  I've used Super Male Vitality.
[01:35:24.225 --> 01:35:28.607]  I use probably about four or five of your products fairly regularly.
[01:35:28.887 --> 01:35:30.988]  I mean, I can say this from my heart.
[01:35:31.168 --> 01:35:31.808]  Highest quality.
[01:35:32.128 --> 01:35:34.850]  I've been sort of on the healthy side of living for about 15 years.
[01:35:35.250 --> 01:35:38.432]  It's very hard to find products of this quality on the open market.
[01:35:39.252 --> 01:35:40.553]  Well, thank you.
[01:35:40.753 --> 01:35:44.435]  And I'm really proud of you because I think that's been one of the best things you've done.
[01:35:44.595 --> 01:35:45.136]  Well, thank you.
[01:35:45.676 --> 01:35:46.897]  I mean, not that I'm Mr. Healthy.
[01:35:47.217 --> 01:35:54.281]  I got where I didn't care about myself, got depressed about the New World Order, kind of saw myself as expendable, gained almost 100 pounds, was just falling apart.
[01:35:54.721 --> 01:35:58.923]  And as I slowly got back into health and stuff, I was trying to find the best, you know, vitamins, minerals.
[01:36:00.024 --> 01:36:02.105]  And you know it's very difficult on the open market.
[01:36:02.125 --> 01:36:03.445]  What's the right vitamin?
[01:36:03.485 --> 01:36:04.405]  Well here's why they do it.
[01:36:04.866 --> 01:36:21.131]  With California standards so high that almost nothing's perfectly clean, I mean there's more lead in the air as you know than there is in a tomato, that it's hard to, so all the time we don't have the product and are sold out because we'll get batches of supposed stuff, it's not, it's contaminated.
[01:36:21.451 --> 01:36:25.092]  So we have to sit back, return it, sometimes get the lawyers back and forth,
[01:36:26.357 --> 01:36:27.958]  So that's why we're sold out half the time.
[01:36:28.198 --> 01:36:31.121]  So I get why companies don't put out perfect stuff, because you basically can't.
[01:36:31.141 --> 01:36:32.222]  The planet's so contaminated.
[01:36:32.822 --> 01:36:40.908]  But again, I think that this part of your, to use your term, operation, I think is really, really great, because this is, we're sort of in this subject anyway.
[01:36:41.529 --> 01:36:50.495]  How do we support people to get themselves right mind, mind, body, soul, so they can fight this, this, this, you know, we all go through this.
[01:36:50.535 --> 01:36:54.639]  We look sometimes, like if you're people like you and I, and we can read the bigger sort of Zeitgeist stuff.
[01:36:55.524 --> 01:36:56.265]  Um, because we're in it.
[01:36:57.025 --> 01:36:57.966]  You know, it's depressive.
[01:36:58.786 --> 01:37:00.648]  You know, there are days you wake up and you're just depressed.
[01:37:00.868 --> 01:37:03.670]  You just want to go outside and have a good time and play catch with somebody.
[01:37:03.690 --> 01:37:03.990]  I agree.
[01:37:04.010 --> 01:37:08.874]  You don't want to sit around and think about how somebody's, you know, you know what in you every second of every day.
[01:37:09.394 --> 01:37:19.382]  And that's the part is, when you get angry, you know what I mean, and I think this is very important, when you get angry sometimes, you know, it's maybe not the most flattering thing to do, but what you are doing is you are helping break that trance.
[01:37:19.402 --> 01:37:23.385]  You're saying, this is the proper reaction to what is happening to me as an individual.
[01:37:24.105 --> 01:37:26.906]  Not as a public personality, as an individual, as a father.
[01:37:27.206 --> 01:37:30.068]  This is what I'm feeling when I'm looking down the road at what I'm seeing.
[01:37:30.468 --> 01:37:33.289]  Exactly, I'm trying to respect people and show how I really feel.
[01:37:33.349 --> 01:37:37.111]  So as I'm upset, I'm panicked, it feels claustrophobic.
[01:37:38.143 --> 01:37:42.505]  After I've read a hundred articles where they're just throwing it in our face, I really blow up because it's real.
[01:37:42.565 --> 01:37:48.349]  And let's not forget, there's a lot of mocking behind that, which also serves up the social justice warrior.
[01:37:48.609 --> 01:37:50.010]  And there's a mocking tone there.
[01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:57.073]  If you think somebody's dumb or uneducated or a bigot or something, mocking them is usually not the best way to get through to them.
[01:37:57.354 --> 01:37:57.514]  Yeah.
[01:37:58.174 --> 01:37:58.894]  You're absolutely right.
[01:37:58.934 --> 01:38:01.656]  Well, specifically, again, Billy Corgan's our guest here.
[01:38:01.696 --> 01:38:04.097]  We were really getting into some hardcore issues during the break.
[01:38:04.117 --> 01:38:11.882]  We're talking about social justice warriors who I fall down to their level because they're so hateful, they're so dumbed down, but they are victims brought up by this culture.
[01:38:12.582 --> 01:38:16.144]  I'm not, either young people are super awake or they're super dumbed down.
[01:38:16.484 --> 01:38:20.586]  The statistics show lower IQs, lower brain activity, near trance state.
[01:38:20.626 --> 01:38:21.627]  That's mainstream news.
[01:38:21.947 --> 01:38:22.848]  We were talking about that.
[01:38:22.948 --> 01:38:26.850]  But still, when they're spitting in your face, attacking your reporters who are really
[01:38:27.410 --> 01:38:28.850]  Well, there's two schools of thought.
[01:38:28.930 --> 01:38:29.390]  One is, they're gone.
[01:38:57.025 --> 01:38:58.286]  You know, they're Maoists.
[01:38:58.487 --> 01:38:59.788]  They have the Little Red Book in their hand.
[01:39:00.008 --> 01:39:00.929]  You're not going to get them back.
[01:39:00.949 --> 01:39:01.490]  It's a cult.
[01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.411]  It's a cult.
[01:39:03.151 --> 01:39:10.519]  And the only thing that's going to adjust their ideological fixation is reality.
[01:39:12.068 --> 01:39:26.867]  I predict that this hashtag generation, because look, for everyone that's out there spinning their little New Year's toy in your reporter's face, and I've watched those clips and I'm horrified, as somebody who believes in free speech and as an artist, because those people are going to be coming for me.
[01:39:27.622 --> 01:39:29.803]  Let's face it, it may not be tomorrow, but it's soon enough.
[01:39:30.343 --> 01:39:32.864]  Because I said the wrong thing on the wrong day because I was tired.
[01:39:32.884 --> 01:39:35.365]  I didn't take my X2 that day or whatever, you know what I mean?
[01:39:35.425 --> 01:39:40.407]  It's like, to live like that, to live where every word is a landmine, you know what I'm saying?
[01:39:40.727 --> 01:39:41.907]  It's not the world I want to live in.
[01:39:41.927 --> 01:39:43.688]  It's not a liberal world!
[01:39:45.029 --> 01:39:45.749]  I grew up a liberal!
[01:39:46.775 --> 01:39:48.577]  I grew up a liberal, so it's odd to me.
[01:39:48.657 --> 01:39:52.740]  Liberals I knew were always like, talk about whatever you want, get it all out in the open, more freedom.
[01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:55.622]  Hey, let's go back to, and I'm sure you could find this.
[01:39:55.863 --> 01:39:57.004]  Remember, was it around 1978?
[01:39:57.104 --> 01:40:02.188]  Okay, Skokie, heavily Jewish community north of Chicago.
[01:40:02.368 --> 01:40:06.271]  I was there growing up at the time when they let the KKK march down the street.
[01:40:06.672 --> 01:40:07.592]  And what was the big issue?
[01:40:07.633 --> 01:40:08.814]  It was a free speech issue.
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:10.181]  We don't like it.
[01:40:10.681 --> 01:40:12.183]  They're thumbing in our nose, but you know what?
[01:40:12.203 --> 01:40:16.447]  It's better to have an America where, you know, these idiots get to walk down the street and spout their hate.
[01:40:16.707 --> 01:40:17.548]  We're better than them!
[01:40:17.688 --> 01:40:18.348]  That's what it was.
[01:40:19.149 --> 01:40:20.070]  That's the world I grew up in.
[01:40:20.370 --> 01:40:25.695]  A liberal, democratically leaning Chicago that was about tolerance and free speech.
[01:40:26.356 --> 01:40:28.398]  Not, shut it down because it's unpleasant.
[01:40:29.179 --> 01:40:32.302]  And again, you haven't said this here, so it's not again.
[01:40:33.806 --> 01:40:40.609]  The lack of tolerance of ideas and other points of view is the great Achilles heel of the social justice warrior movement.
[01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:43.871]  They do not apply their philosophical bent across the board equally.
[01:40:44.151 --> 01:40:46.612]  That's their, that's what exposes them every time.
[01:40:46.793 --> 01:40:48.493]  And you guys are doing a great job of exposing that.
[01:40:48.834 --> 01:40:57.338]  But most people, most people who are not down there at the rally and spinning their twizzler and making up stories about, you know, ghosts that don't exist.
[01:40:57.758 --> 01:40:59.459]  And it's a lot of fantasy stuff going on there.
[01:40:59.479 --> 01:41:01.660]  I mean it literally is like, it could be a wizard world.
[01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:11.405]  They just caught basically a gay pastor here in Austin at Whole Foods claiming the gay baker put fag on his cake and they have like surveillance video now of the cake being delivered and it's not on there.
[01:41:12.206 --> 01:41:15.348]  I mean, now they're even targeting liberal places.
[01:41:15.548 --> 01:41:18.990]  That's a perfect jumping off point for what I really want to try to get at.
[01:41:19.630 --> 01:41:22.211]  Okay, what do most people do?
[01:41:22.592 --> 01:41:26.274]  Most people's relationship, like let's take my friend who's a HuffPo reader, okay?
[01:41:27.290 --> 01:41:30.091]  He, in his heart, is a classic liberal.
[01:41:30.551 --> 01:41:31.652]  He cares about everybody.
[01:41:32.032 --> 01:41:34.913]  He loves music from every race, creed, and color.
[01:41:35.293 --> 01:41:36.594]  Not a racist in his heart.
[01:41:37.314 --> 01:41:37.574]  Okay?
[01:41:39.655 --> 01:41:44.497]  He reads that stuff, and he thinks by participating, by hashtagging, he's on the good team.
[01:41:45.357 --> 01:41:45.537]  Right?
[01:41:45.777 --> 01:41:49.739]  So the people you've got to get through to is the people who don't have the little red book yet.
[01:41:50.612 --> 01:41:53.373]  Who do care about humanity and do care about free speech.
[01:41:53.953 --> 01:41:58.815]  And you have to get them to understand how their participation in those... They're being inducted into a cult.
[01:41:58.955 --> 01:41:59.655]  Absolutely.
[01:42:00.456 --> 01:42:03.477]  And nobody wants to admit that they're being fooled.
[01:42:03.817 --> 01:42:07.738]  Now I work in professional wrestling, TNA Impact Wrestling, on Tuesday nights on Pop Network.
[01:42:07.758 --> 01:42:08.379]  There's my commercial.
[01:42:08.439 --> 01:42:09.539]  I've seen it, it's just great.
[01:42:09.679 --> 01:42:09.979]  Thank you.
[01:42:12.196 --> 01:42:13.576]  You know, what's the old carny term?
[01:42:13.736 --> 01:42:14.257]  They're Marx.
[01:42:15.137 --> 01:42:16.097]  What was the carny idea?
[01:42:16.117 --> 01:42:17.017]  We're going to stage a fight.
[01:42:17.037 --> 01:42:19.078]  You know, it started in the carnivals in the 1900s.
[01:42:19.118 --> 01:42:20.598]  We're going to stage a fight.
[01:42:20.618 --> 01:42:28.160]  We're going to get the local yokels to believe that the kid from the sticks is going to fight the big guy, and if he can beat him, you know, and that's how professional wrestling started.
[01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:30.161]  Believing that what you were witnessing was real.
[01:42:30.721 --> 01:42:31.961]  And you suspend disbelief.
[01:42:32.221 --> 01:42:32.441]  Yes.
[01:42:32.921 --> 01:42:33.881]  Well, that's what we have.
[01:42:34.042 --> 01:42:35.602]  We have a world of suspended disbelief.
[01:42:37.519 --> 01:42:41.184]  I want to play a short clip we can talk over of just a few social justice warriors.
[01:42:42.205 --> 01:42:48.492]  And what's amazing is people will talk to him and go, listen, I don't even support Trump, but I support free and open elections.
[01:42:48.513 --> 01:42:49.414]  What about Bernie Sanders?
[01:42:50.074 --> 01:42:52.397]  And they just spit in our reporter's face.
[01:42:53.098 --> 01:43:02.982]  And spit on somebody else just because they just want to hate somebody and they literally are like a dumb Klan guy that just pulls over on some black guy walking home from work and kills him because they're black.
[01:43:03.203 --> 01:43:05.464]  They want to just project something onto you.
[01:43:05.744 --> 01:43:08.465]  Let's flip the script here for a second, okay?
[01:43:08.865 --> 01:43:14.948]  And this is a very, I'm going to try to say this in a sort of hypothetical Star Wars holodeck type of way, okay?
[01:43:15.348 --> 01:43:16.649]  If we could transport back to
[01:43:17.549 --> 01:43:20.191]  You know, a much, much more, much, much more racist.
[01:43:20.251 --> 01:43:24.313]  I'm not saying America doesn't have a racist Ben, but so let's, let's, let's put that out there to start with.
[01:43:24.733 --> 01:43:27.435]  Let's go back to a time where racism was accepted.
[01:43:27.855 --> 01:43:29.216]  It was institutionalized.
[01:43:29.716 --> 01:43:29.976]  Okay.
[01:43:30.557 --> 01:43:41.023]  If you could go back to Selma 1932 and the Klan members spitting in some person of color's face, don't you think that guy thought he was right too?
[01:43:41.723 --> 01:43:42.024]  Yes.
[01:43:42.284 --> 01:43:42.504]  Okay.
[01:43:42.884 --> 01:43:44.205]  So how is this any different?
[01:43:45.276 --> 01:43:45.777]  It's not.
[01:43:45.837 --> 01:43:48.941]  And then you realize America has problems, but the media doesn't teach.
[01:43:49.081 --> 01:43:51.545]  Every other country had stuff worse, usually.
[01:43:51.845 --> 01:43:55.370]  But to look to the media to educate us, we're stuck on Cronkite.
[01:43:55.870 --> 01:43:57.593]  And even he was part of the deal.
[01:43:58.752 --> 01:44:02.955]  I'm saying, we have to understand, we have to be our own judge and jury here.
[01:44:03.095 --> 01:44:09.719]  Well, George Washington wasn't allowed in most of the private clubs or businesses where you had to be given entree to even operate as a landowner.
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:13.122]  So he was going under something lesser than, quote, black slaves.
[01:44:13.442 --> 01:44:18.665]  The point was, is that it was his will to be on an equal playing field that helped lead that revolution.
[01:44:19.106 --> 01:44:28.352]  So it's just all these forms of class and control, whereas it should be about free, open, human dialogue and free association.
[01:44:28.892 --> 01:44:32.394]  Look, I work in a very rapacious and cruel business.
[01:44:33.114 --> 01:44:33.394]  You know?
[01:44:33.514 --> 01:44:36.815]  I'm 49 years old, and I'm, you know, I'm 30 plus years in the game.
[01:44:36.895 --> 01:44:40.177]  I mean, I'm on the 0.001% of the survivor list.
[01:44:41.017 --> 01:44:41.257]  Okay?
[01:44:41.657 --> 01:44:42.598]  It's a brutal business.
[01:44:42.838 --> 01:44:47.620]  It's a brutal business, and I'm not asking for... And by the way, you look the best I've ever seen for a rock star in this 30 years.
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:48.280]  God bless you.
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:49.000]  My God.
[01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:49.921]  You're a handsome man.
[01:44:50.001 --> 01:44:50.801]  No, no, no, no.
[01:44:50.841 --> 01:44:51.441]  You're healthy, man.
[01:44:51.481 --> 01:44:51.782]  It's true.
[01:44:52.082 --> 01:44:52.362]  Thank you.
[01:44:53.143 --> 01:45:03.852]  So what I'm trying to say is, I personally, even though I don't like it, I personally don't mind a capitalist society that leverages its power based on opportunity.
[01:45:03.952 --> 01:45:14.702]  Because I believe in any socio-political capitalist system that existed, America has provided more freedom for more people for the longest period of time.
[01:45:15.282 --> 01:45:17.063]  So, are there losers in that game?
[01:45:17.223 --> 01:45:17.483]  Yes.
[01:45:17.783 --> 01:45:19.804]  And at some point, even I'm a loser in that game.
[01:45:20.084 --> 01:45:23.725]  But I believe in that system more than a system that would be gamed for me.
[01:45:24.205 --> 01:45:28.347]  I would sell more records, I would have more opportunities, if I would turn into one of those past-90s records.
[01:45:28.367 --> 01:45:28.587]  Sure, sure.
[01:45:28.707 --> 01:45:33.289]  I was offered first $2 million a year, like 18 years ago, and then $5 million, and then even more.
[01:45:33.849 --> 01:45:39.016]  I mean, we're talking over $10 million a year contract to have shows bigger than Glenn Beck's Limbaugh.
[01:45:39.036 --> 01:45:40.998]  I mean, I've been offered it all by the big syndicates.
[01:45:41.119 --> 01:45:46.646]  So what are we... And the problem is that that wasn't winning to me to have the biggest house in a private jet.
[01:45:46.746 --> 01:45:51.732]  Winning is to see 9-11 truth that I exposed now all over the newspapers 15 years later.
[01:45:52.293 --> 01:45:54.315]  To expose the tyrants that did this.
[01:45:54.335 --> 01:45:56.957]  I mean, I really think about myself with everybody else.
[01:45:57.057 --> 01:45:58.118]  I really have empathy.
[01:45:58.499 --> 01:46:00.360]  And it's not because I'm some loving goody two-shoes.
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:04.244]  That's a normal human instinct of someone that wants to live on a good planet.
[01:46:04.264 --> 01:46:12.111]  Why do most people, like we all have extended friends and family, and we would probably classify most of those people as good-hearted, or we probably wouldn't have them in our lives.
[01:46:12.131 --> 01:46:13.892]  And I think that probably goes for anybody listening to us.
[01:46:13.932 --> 01:46:14.213]  Yes.
[01:46:14.553 --> 01:46:14.693]  Okay.
[01:46:15.914 --> 01:46:19.835]  What is happening that is allowing those people to be led down a path?
[01:46:20.055 --> 01:46:26.036]  Goebbels said we give them dumbed-down propaganda that just gives them an excuse to be confused and lay down and do nothing.
[01:46:26.696 --> 01:46:37.178]  Okay, so if you're trying to come at it from a different angle, because we see the rise of the social justice worry movement as another propaganda kind of control arm, right?
[01:46:37.538 --> 01:46:38.418]  It's here to control us.
[01:46:38.838 --> 01:46:39.458]  It's the Maoists.
[01:46:39.718 --> 01:46:40.238]  Here they come.
[01:46:40.718 --> 01:46:41.499]  And they'll use kids.
[01:46:41.879 --> 01:46:42.639]  I mean, they have no shame.
[01:46:42.819 --> 01:46:43.759]  It's classic tyranny.
[01:46:44.079 --> 01:46:44.699]  Okay, right.
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:49.803]  So what is allowing people who in their own hearts have a differing opinion to be led down this path?
[01:46:50.063 --> 01:46:56.988]  It's a collectivism, it's a peer pressure, it's shaming, it's guilting, it's... It's like gang member stuff.
[01:46:57.008 --> 01:47:08.997]  They're young, they're uninformed, they take them to the college, they put them under pressure, they send them to group... But again, that stuff can exist against a majority who deep down doesn't really truly in their hearts believe... So, liberty lovers,
[01:47:09.617 --> 01:47:11.117]  Have to reach out to young people.
[01:47:11.178 --> 01:47:12.778]  They have to get involved in the community.
[01:47:13.058 --> 01:47:16.659]  They have to go be part of the student groups, whether it's Boy Scouts or whatever it is.
[01:47:16.939 --> 01:47:17.760]  We have to reach out.
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:18.820]  We have to go to the colleges.
[01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:19.780]  We have to volunteer.
[01:47:20.180 --> 01:47:25.122]  We all have to go and reach into these groups and break the centralized control that's coming in.
[01:47:25.162 --> 01:47:25.702]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:47:25.742 --> 01:47:27.302]  And stop clicking the pop culture?
[01:47:27.623 --> 01:47:34.645]  I think I think there's stuff to be said there, but I think for most people that's probably more effort than they can make because, you know, it's not a great economy and stuff like this.
[01:47:35.005 --> 01:47:38.166]  I think you have to look that look again back to the Infowar thing.
[01:47:39.062 --> 01:47:49.006]  Whether you realized it or not, you saw something coming long before other people that the ultimate sort of collapse here was predicated on a psychological control.
[01:47:49.447 --> 01:47:51.227]  The things you're still talking about are very real.
[01:47:51.467 --> 01:47:52.908]  Most people are in their community.
[01:47:53.228 --> 01:47:56.330]  Most people feel they are participants in their community on some level.
[01:47:56.590 --> 01:47:58.310]  Even if they're paying taxes, they're a participant.
[01:47:58.391 --> 01:48:00.091]  They don't like when the water bill goes up.
[01:48:00.351 --> 01:48:01.212]  We're all part of that.
[01:48:01.892 --> 01:48:10.557]  I'm talking about a more collectivist concept where, you know, you have this merging of technology, the new robber barons, you know what I mean?
[01:48:10.577 --> 01:48:11.798]  And I know some of them personally.
[01:48:12.018 --> 01:48:13.058]  I hang out with them, you know?
[01:48:13.238 --> 01:48:14.619]  So they're not real to me.
[01:48:16.647 --> 01:48:20.490]  Sure, and they go along with the bigger robber barons, because the minute they get out of line, they get crushed.
[01:48:20.890 --> 01:48:24.293]  People don't know, the ultra-rich are the most controlled.
[01:48:24.353 --> 01:48:25.073]  The most cloistered.
[01:48:25.093 --> 01:48:30.477]  Let's break it down, so that anybody walking down the street listening can understand what we're saying.
[01:48:31.418 --> 01:48:35.661]  At the highest levels of power, should we blame power for being powerful?
[01:48:36.121 --> 01:48:37.883]  Or should we blame the powerful being powerful?
[01:48:38.283 --> 01:48:39.525]  Most people are not powerful.
[01:48:39.945 --> 01:48:47.853]  So when you talk to them about these things, even though they can relate, and maybe they even have a personal reaction, there's not much they can do, because it's the Borg.
[01:48:48.514 --> 01:48:50.396]  You know, to use the Star Trek word.
[01:48:50.876 --> 01:48:51.417]  It's the Borg.
[01:48:53.115 --> 01:49:00.220]  If you don't realize you're supporting the Borg, yet you feel oppressed by the Borg, the next natural question is, well, how do I not support the Borg?
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:01.080]  So that's it.
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:04.402]  How do we begin, none of us are perfect, to pull out of the system?
[01:49:04.422 --> 01:49:04.683]  Yes.
[01:49:04.863 --> 01:49:07.765]  Plant a garden, go to the local, swap meat.
[01:49:07.805 --> 01:49:10.987]  Sorry, I don't, you know, that's important, and I don't mean to diminish what you're saying.
[01:49:11.047 --> 01:49:11.407]  No, no, go ahead.
[01:49:11.427 --> 01:49:14.249]  We're talking about the technocratic part of this equation.
[01:49:14.589 --> 01:49:15.490]  So how do we engage there?
[01:49:16.778 --> 01:49:17.018]  Okay.
[01:49:17.839 --> 01:49:18.999]  Pick your favorite company.
[01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:19.780]  Doesn't matter.
[01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:21.341]  I'm in these systems, right?
[01:49:21.401 --> 01:49:23.822]  So I have to dance carefully around these subjects, okay?
[01:49:24.362 --> 01:49:26.563]  Pick your favorite system and follow the money.
[01:49:27.684 --> 01:49:28.304]  Follow the money.
[01:49:28.865 --> 01:49:35.288]  Understand how your lack of curiosity or lack of knowledge about who you're... So you're in the biggest defense contractor.
[01:49:35.848 --> 01:49:36.589]  How did you get into that?
[01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:39.030]  Say that again?
[01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:40.411]  I mean, a long time ago.
[01:49:40.431 --> 01:49:41.472]  It just boomed suddenly, yeah.
[01:49:41.952 --> 01:49:42.092]  Right.
[01:49:43.447 --> 01:49:45.489]  You have to look at the systems that you engage in.
[01:49:45.989 --> 01:49:46.730]  Pick your system.
[01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:48.272]  Is it a social media system?
[01:49:48.332 --> 01:49:50.814]  And by the way, they'll attack you for that, but you just volunteered that.
[01:49:51.154 --> 01:49:55.138]  I'll tell you something I've talked about publicly, so there's no new information here, but it illustrates the point.
[01:49:55.799 --> 01:49:57.460]  I quit Twitter about six months ago.
[01:49:57.580 --> 01:49:58.721]  I had about 300,000 followers.
[01:49:58.821 --> 01:49:59.422]  I remember, yeah.
[01:49:59.522 --> 01:49:59.782]  Okay?
[01:50:00.183 --> 01:50:01.864]  Twitter called me within the week.
[01:50:02.165 --> 01:50:03.005]  Why did you quit Twitter?
[01:50:03.874 --> 01:50:11.739]  I said because you guys treat my participation the same as the guy who sits all day and hashtags F you this and F you that and F, you know what I'm saying?
[01:50:12.119 --> 01:50:18.243]  My vote and my participation in your system is worth more to you than some jerk who just tweets negative stuff all day.
[01:50:18.303 --> 01:50:18.984]  And you know that.
[01:50:19.284 --> 01:50:20.405]  And the guy said, yes we do.
[01:50:20.825 --> 01:50:21.886]  Which is why we're calling you.
[01:50:22.833 --> 01:50:32.196]  And I said, so you're basically using my credibility, my social status, my celebrity, my power, whatever, however you want to quantify it.
[01:50:32.456 --> 01:50:34.397]  You're using it to build up your IPO.
[01:50:35.177 --> 01:50:35.417]  Right?
[01:50:35.537 --> 01:50:35.917]  Aren't you?
[01:50:37.097 --> 01:50:45.040]  So how do we, the people that bring real skin to the game, demand from the technocracy that we're part of, whether we like it or not, how do we demand?
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:46.980]  You have to hurt them where it hurts.
[01:50:48.121 --> 01:50:48.821]  It's a numbers game.
[01:50:50.049 --> 01:50:52.471]  I want to come back then and talk about that, because you're absolutely right.
[01:50:52.491 --> 01:50:53.932]  We can't just sit here and bitch at the system.
[01:50:54.032 --> 01:50:54.673]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:50:54.693 --> 01:50:55.473]  When we're all part of it.
[01:50:55.973 --> 01:50:56.674]  We are part of it.
[01:50:57.355 --> 01:50:57.875]  Well, I agree.
[01:50:57.915 --> 01:51:01.758]  That's key, but I believe an even bigger key is what you first wanted to get into, and you have.
[01:51:02.138 --> 01:51:09.704]  How do you get the general person, you've talked a lot about it, to realize they're being manipulated, they're in a lower brainwave level near sleep?
[01:51:09.944 --> 01:51:10.725]  That's mainstream news.
[01:51:11.445 --> 01:51:14.747]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:51:14.927 --> 01:51:17.188]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:51:17.348 --> 01:51:25.732]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:51:25.992 --> 01:51:29.333]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[01:51:29.493 --> 01:51:39.798]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:51:40.118 --> 01:51:47.401]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:51:47.622 --> 01:51:49.502]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:51:49.843 --> 01:51:57.406]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:51:57.786 --> 01:52:03.952]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[01:53:11.118 --> 01:53:20.131]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:53:20.211 --> 01:53:28.322]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:53:28.602 --> 01:53:33.284]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:53:33.484 --> 01:53:40.167]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:53:40.267 --> 01:53:47.331]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:53:47.451 --> 01:53:54.294]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:53:54.474 --> 01:53:58.817]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:53:58.958 --> 01:54:02.200]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:08.465]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:54:08.645 --> 01:54:10.306]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[01:54:14.021 --> 01:54:18.243]  Alright, for 15-20 minutes the next hour, Lee and Mack will be in studio with us from Billy Corgan.
[01:54:18.263 --> 01:54:19.283]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:54:20.403 --> 01:54:22.044]  Please remember, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:54:22.364 --> 01:54:24.444]  Voting with your dollars, voting with your feet, your actions.
[01:54:24.664 --> 01:54:26.265]  Getting great products, funds the operation.
[01:54:26.585 --> 01:54:28.926]  We got that big special, 45% off on RainForce.
[01:54:29.226 --> 01:54:31.847]  Great new tropic that will end tomorrow.
[01:54:31.947 --> 01:54:32.787]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:54:34.161 --> 01:54:35.342]  Billy, we got Leon coming in.
[01:54:35.362 --> 01:54:40.906]  We'll get more into social justice warriors, this big time of change, things we're moving into.
[01:54:41.466 --> 01:54:46.870]  Clearly the future battle space, as they call it, the Pentagon, is being shaped right now.
[01:54:46.890 --> 01:54:48.411]  A critical time.
[01:54:49.032 --> 01:54:53.175]  So many people that have served the establishment are realizing now they were set up.
[01:54:53.675 --> 01:54:55.677]  They were being set up to be obsolete.
[01:54:56.158 --> 01:54:57.400]  A technocracy is coming in.
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:54:58.481]  The robot takeover.
[01:54:58.501 --> 01:54:59.662]  This is the elites on admissions.
[01:54:59.943 --> 01:55:10.535]  But if we're there putting out the narrative that humans have a choice and a destiny and that folks can break out of their trance, make decisions with their actions, that can really change the future of this.
[01:55:10.876 --> 01:55:12.417]  And the Pentagon even admits
[01:55:13.078 --> 01:55:23.444]  In their own reports, like their Jade Helm report about mastering the human domain, stopping empowered individuals and new ideas, their own admission reads like an indictment.
[01:55:23.804 --> 01:55:25.725]  And of course, the military themselves are great people.
[01:55:26.146 --> 01:55:34.651]  It's so crazy, you know, the most awake people are in the military, but then the Pentagon's own battle plan is like a treasonous letter against humanity.
[01:55:35.251 --> 01:55:35.851]  Let's start here.
[01:55:36.572 --> 01:55:37.812]  Nature abhors a vacuum.
[01:55:38.593 --> 01:55:38.813]  Okay?
[01:55:39.986 --> 01:55:42.048]  So, pick your system.
[01:55:42.588 --> 01:55:48.133]  Military, social control, the educational systems of control.
[01:55:48.974 --> 01:55:59.583]  They're stepping into a space that's been created by the average American's abdication of their civic and social responsibility to help run a society which has
[01:56:02.305 --> 01:56:03.907]  A reasonable level of control.
[01:56:03.927 --> 01:56:05.168]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:56:05.608 --> 01:56:10.613]  Like, I used to sit on steps when I was 18 years old with the kids with the spike chair and they'd talk about anarchy.
[01:56:11.154 --> 01:56:14.097]  And I'd say, that's great, but like, are you not going to have a toilet?
[01:56:14.777 --> 01:56:23.446]  You know, so, if we accept that the average American vision is, you know, clean living and social systems and government... And that social contract's being broken.
[01:56:24.907 --> 01:56:27.649]  Yes, but it's being broken.
[01:56:28.249 --> 01:56:36.074]  Now, you've made fantastic arguments for why it's being broken, but it can only happen because the average American is letting it happen.
[01:56:36.094 --> 01:56:37.195]  We don't stand up for ourselves.
[01:56:37.776 --> 01:56:39.357]  Well, let's just say it.
[01:56:39.697 --> 01:56:40.838]  Some people are gone.
[01:56:41.178 --> 01:56:45.541]  We don't revel in that fact like the establishment, but some of these people are dangerous zombies.
[01:56:46.001 --> 01:56:51.505]  So what do you do at the point... To use your term, and other guests on your show, they've been weaponized.
[01:56:52.458 --> 01:56:54.343]  Okay, so let's just keep it real simple.
[01:56:55.526 --> 01:56:56.990]  Let's say 20% of the people are awake.
[01:56:57.950 --> 01:57:00.772]  Let's say 20% of the people are weaponized.
[01:57:00.792 --> 01:57:01.593]  Okay?
[01:57:01.833 --> 01:57:02.894]  So the fight is over the other 60%.
[01:57:04.174 --> 01:57:06.976]  Who thinks because they hashtag about somebody else across the world?
[01:57:06.996 --> 01:57:09.238]  Or thinks because they live in a nice house, they're immune from it.
[01:57:09.338 --> 01:57:10.179]  No, you're not.
[01:57:10.499 --> 01:57:12.120]  The future of humanity is being decided.
[01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:12.340]  Right.
[01:57:12.780 --> 01:57:13.221]  Exactly.
[01:57:13.261 --> 01:57:15.362]  Because more are getting weaponized, folks.
[01:57:15.442 --> 01:57:16.203]  More are waking up.
[01:57:16.483 --> 01:57:17.724]  But more are weaponizing.
[01:57:18.024 --> 01:57:18.705]  There's a race.
[01:57:18.925 --> 01:57:21.046]  So you have a series of choices.
[01:57:21.587 --> 01:57:26.210]  First, you'd have to identify the systems that you engage in and whether those systems are
[01:57:27.911 --> 01:57:31.414]  Zero-sum games, whether they're positive or negative for you and your family.
[01:57:32.355 --> 01:57:35.157]  So take any social media system.
[01:57:35.858 --> 01:57:38.240]  Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram.
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:42.764]  Is your participation in those systems actually making your life worse on some level?
[01:57:42.924 --> 01:57:44.165]  Now, most people would laugh at that.
[01:57:44.405 --> 01:57:45.366]  What does that mean?
[01:57:45.946 --> 01:57:53.933]  Just because I retweet a couple pictures or whatever, I mean, is that, well, if you're supporting things that are ultimately hurting your community, then that argument can
[01:57:53.953 --> 01:58:01.395]  And if you're making your life useless crap on these platforms, I only use Twitter and Facebook to attack them and to expose what they're doing.
[01:58:01.435 --> 01:58:02.435]  And still I feel guilty.
[01:58:02.475 --> 01:58:04.956]  Drudge says, hey, you shouldn't even do that, only do your own thing.
[01:58:05.216 --> 01:58:10.138]  And more and more I think he's right, because they already have algorithms cheating us and stopping us from getting stuff out.
[01:58:10.158 --> 01:58:10.378]  Absolutely.
[01:58:10.398 --> 01:58:14.199]  I mean, Twitter's been caught suppressing and deleting things.
[01:58:14.239 --> 01:58:15.159]  Well, they do it all the time.
[01:58:15.499 --> 01:58:18.000]  So you think Drudge is right, I should just totally disengage?
[01:58:18.461 --> 01:58:22.783]  There is certainly a movement in the technological community that's all going to be what they call over-the-top network.
[01:58:22.903 --> 01:58:32.448]  In essence, you would rather have 300,000 people coming to Alex Jones every day than you having to work in other systems and de facto supporting those systems.
[01:58:32.528 --> 01:58:37.751]  Now those arguments can go either way and I couldn't advise you one way as a friend what is better.
[01:58:38.031 --> 01:58:39.471]  I'm involved in those systems as well.
[01:58:39.732 --> 01:58:43.714]  So what I would argue for is let's call it a conscientious participation.
[01:58:44.594 --> 01:58:46.857]  If you are, if you are a... Wow, that's a good call.
[01:58:46.897 --> 01:58:47.158]  Stay there.
[01:58:47.178 --> 01:58:48.039]  We'll come back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:48.099 --> 01:58:48.840]  Conscientious.
[01:58:49.541 --> 01:58:50.462]  Wow, that's, that's powerful.
[01:58:51.303 --> 01:58:51.664]  Stay with us.
[01:58:51.684 --> 01:58:52.745]  Billy Corgan's our guest.
[01:58:53.046 --> 01:58:53.827]  Oh, his Facebook!
[01:58:53.887 --> 01:58:55.048]  We put his Facebook up on screen.
[01:58:55.068 --> 01:58:56.010]  We're using the enemy system.
[01:58:56.170 --> 01:58:56.971]  What's your Facebook again?
[01:58:57.211 --> 01:58:57.612]  She's huge?
[01:58:57.772 --> 01:58:58.213]  No idea.
[01:58:58.453 --> 01:58:59.134]  Oh yeah, it's big.
[01:58:59.174 --> 01:58:59.575]  We'll put it up.
[01:59:01.351 --> 01:59:04.292]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[01:59:04.592 --> 01:59:14.174]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[01:59:28.897 --> 01:59:37.462]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[01:59:37.723 --> 01:59:44.587]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigyrex herbal processing technique.

[01:59:58.018 --> 02:00:00.059]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:19.765]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:00:20.385 --> 02:00:23.407]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:29.852 --> 02:00:32.134]  There is Billy Corgan on his Facebook page.
[02:00:32.154 --> 02:00:34.996]  He says he doesn't know about the Smashing Pumpkins musical band.
[02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:37.661]  I don't know what it's called.
[02:00:37.681 --> 02:00:38.001]  No, no, no.
[02:00:38.061 --> 02:00:38.582]  I'm teasing you.
[02:00:39.482 --> 02:00:41.544]  So folks can obviously follow that.
[02:00:41.564 --> 02:00:43.165]  But I think we should use these.
[02:00:43.425 --> 02:00:45.166]  The censorship is ratcheting in now.
[02:00:45.587 --> 02:00:47.468]  And we were always there before it got really bad.
[02:00:47.708 --> 02:00:50.030]  But we're going to complain about it while they drowned us.
[02:00:50.090 --> 02:00:51.571]  While they push our head under the water.
[02:00:52.031 --> 02:00:53.613]  Because they say, oh, it's our platform.
[02:00:53.873 --> 02:00:57.718]  In fact, the media is even cheerleading Facebook to, hey, censor people against Trump and things.
[02:00:57.738 --> 02:00:58.900]  You know, it's your platform.
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:02.705]  But you advertise it's our little safe space to share our life with others.
[02:01:03.065 --> 02:01:08.573]  If I'm not violating your terms of service, well, now the terms of service says you can't disagree with someone, Billy.
[02:01:09.690 --> 02:01:12.851]  Right, so go back to the idea of conscientious participation.
[02:01:13.011 --> 02:01:21.114]  Is that system that you're engaging in, is that actually helping to enslave you and take you away from the world and or America that you want to live in?
[02:01:21.654 --> 02:01:23.014]  Or is it empowering you?
[02:01:23.034 --> 02:01:24.195]  And then you have to make those decisions.
[02:01:24.215 --> 02:01:27.476]  I only use Facebook and Twitter to inject that it's the Matrix.
[02:01:27.996 --> 02:01:32.578]  Kind of like a warning, you know, sign or an airplane flying over dropping leaflets over Nazi Germany.
[02:01:32.598 --> 02:01:33.118]  Does that make sense?
[02:01:33.658 --> 02:01:44.382]  Yes, but I guess what I'm coming at is, you know, a soccer mom who's got two kids, she's overburdened, she loves Facebook because she gets to look at her sister's photos.
[02:01:44.462 --> 02:01:48.943]  I'm not even trying to demonize anybody, because you can take those things 50 different ways.
[02:01:49.043 --> 02:01:53.805]  And most people, although they can relate to what they're saying, they don't really understand how it affects them.
[02:01:57.148 --> 02:01:57.948]  It's a numbers game.
[02:01:58.708 --> 02:02:04.630]  If 10% of people left any social system right now, that would be critical damage against those systems.
[02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:07.651]  You're talking about like a Facebook strike or a Twitter strike.
[02:02:07.711 --> 02:02:10.731]  Until they start behaving better, we need to use our power.
[02:02:11.172 --> 02:02:15.893]  I'm talking about people understanding that they have a lot more leverage in the system than they think.
[02:02:16.713 --> 02:02:18.955]  Okay, so is your leverage to leave?
[02:02:19.335 --> 02:02:20.936]  Is your leverage to call for a boycott?
[02:02:21.056 --> 02:02:27.780]  Is your leverage to band together and try to create your own movements like you do, using those systems to your benefit?
[02:02:28.361 --> 02:02:35.025]  Not reducing yourself to what you would call the enemy, but actually rising above and calling for a higher conversation.
[02:02:35.285 --> 02:02:40.949]  So for example, we can get into the minutiae and the weeds of every... So tell Facebook you can screw me but use some libertation.
[02:02:42.710 --> 02:02:44.631]  I'm not participating.
[02:02:46.434 --> 02:02:48.316]  Okay, now you took me off my game.
[02:02:48.376 --> 02:02:50.037]  I'm sorry, I was so dialed in.
[02:02:50.077 --> 02:02:50.678]  Go, go, go back.
[02:02:50.918 --> 02:02:52.299]  I don't know where to go with that.
[02:02:53.020 --> 02:02:55.181]  I don't.
[02:02:55.542 --> 02:03:01.106]  I mean, we have to somehow leverage the fact that we exist on these platforms and not just let them program us.
[02:03:01.406 --> 02:03:08.372]  Right, well when you're finding out that they have been subverting people's tweets and hiding conservative voices that are out there.
[02:03:08.793 --> 02:03:09.493]  Sorry to interrupt you.
[02:03:09.974 --> 02:03:11.515]  I remember what I was going to say.
[02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:20.783]  The critical, if we want to kind of loop together, social media structures, the social justice warrior movement, and all that kind of stuff.
[02:03:21.203 --> 02:03:29.586]  And even the rise of, you know, let's call it this other voice in that sort of discourse, which is using the sort of old leftist tactics now on the right side.
[02:03:29.626 --> 02:03:36.488]  The Breitbarts and Dr. Savage, who's now risen to prominence after a long and distinguished career.
[02:03:37.328 --> 02:03:40.609]  Okay, what is to me, what stitches that all together?
[02:03:40.690 --> 02:03:41.090]  Free speech.
[02:03:42.318 --> 02:03:42.738]  Free speech.
[02:03:43.379 --> 02:03:46.001]  Once we lose free speech in this country, forget it.
[02:03:46.521 --> 02:03:47.642]  It won't matter what we think.
[02:03:47.782 --> 02:03:50.504]  On Drudge's visit, he said, look, they're coming out to free speech next year.
[02:03:50.584 --> 02:03:51.184]  This is next year.
[02:03:51.244 --> 02:03:57.109]  I was listening that day, and I think that was probably one of the most important moments in the history of your broadcasting.
[02:03:57.989 --> 02:04:06.415]  Because that shows you that he sees something, you see something, and together you're, it's like, you know what they call that multiplier, one times one equals a hundred.
[02:04:07.395 --> 02:04:17.078]  You and Drudge on even the same wavelength, even if you guys don't agree about a lot of stuff, you guys on the same wavelength, that's the power, that's the force multiplier.
[02:04:17.098 --> 02:04:18.259]  Huge amplification.
[02:04:18.819 --> 02:04:21.260]  Right, but what is the common stitch there?
[02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:22.400]  Free speech.
[02:04:23.741 --> 02:04:26.642]  Once we give up free speech in this country, it is over.
[02:04:27.805 --> 02:04:28.326]  It is over.
[02:04:28.446 --> 02:04:32.010]  And that's what the social justice warriors on the new left are pushing.
[02:04:32.091 --> 02:04:35.435]  They're weaponized anti-free speech.
[02:04:35.455 --> 02:04:36.236]  They're weaponized.
[02:04:36.276 --> 02:04:37.597]  Weaponized anti-free speech.
[02:04:37.638 --> 02:04:40.661]  Billy Corgan warns of weaponized anti-free speech.
[02:04:40.741 --> 02:04:41.402]  Watch the clips.
[02:04:42.043 --> 02:04:43.785]  I am horrified to see young people.
[02:04:44.426 --> 02:04:57.589]  Who are coming from a variety of backgrounds and you could argue maybe even feel they have a right and or a true story to feel that they're victims in a in a culture or system that doesn't recognize their participation as it should.
[02:04:57.929 --> 02:05:06.870]  Those are important and relevant discussions that are ongoing in America and will probably well hopefully they will end one day but they won't end in our lifetime.
[02:05:06.890 --> 02:05:10.431]  All right stay there and Leanne's gonna pop in on this on the other side follow them on Facebook.
[02:05:10.851 --> 02:05:14.153]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:05:14.313 --> 02:05:16.575]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:05:16.755 --> 02:05:25.141]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:05:25.381 --> 02:05:28.743]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[02:05:28.883 --> 02:05:40.691]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula sourced from powerful
[02:05:40.731 --> 02:05:41.472]  I don't know.
[02:06:10.871 --> 02:06:19.876]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:06:19.956 --> 02:06:28.181]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:06:28.361 --> 02:06:33.064]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:06:33.244 --> 02:06:39.087]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowars.com.
[02:06:39.127 --> 02:06:39.808]  We're good to go.
[02:07:02.008 --> 02:07:03.389]  My name is Alex Jones.
[02:07:03.489 --> 02:07:10.354]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:07:10.395 --> 02:07:12.116]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[02:07:21.463 --> 02:07:35.569]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[02:07:35.989 --> 02:07:40.071]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[02:07:44.013 --> 02:07:46.495]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated.
[02:07:46.815 --> 02:07:48.337]  My muscle mass increased.
[02:07:48.557 --> 02:07:51.139]  My stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[02:07:51.419 --> 02:07:57.164]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[02:07:57.284 --> 02:08:03.549]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:07.452]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[02:08:16.388 --> 02:08:22.190]  Live from Austin, Texas, Smashing Pumpkins, Billy Corgan joins us with Leanne McAteer.
[02:08:23.131 --> 02:08:23.811]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.231 --> 02:08:28.052]  If you're receiving this transmission, you're not in a trance.
[02:08:28.132 --> 02:08:31.754]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:33.354 --> 02:08:33.675]  Live.
[02:08:34.155 --> 02:08:37.396]  I don't know why they want us in a trance, though.
[02:08:37.456 --> 02:08:38.316]  To be alive?
[02:08:38.596 --> 02:08:39.297]  I'm not bragging.
[02:08:39.417 --> 02:08:39.737]  I'm like,
[02:08:41.027 --> 02:08:49.232]  I did drugs here and there in like high school and college a few times and they didn't really boost my, but being really alive and involved and knowing what's going on, I like bounce off the walls.
[02:08:49.612 --> 02:08:53.415]  I'm like, hi, I've had one cup of coffee today and some fruit punch.
[02:08:53.455 --> 02:09:04.801]  I mean, I am literally bouncing off the walls because it's so exciting to be talking about 9-11 truth and now seeing it be top headlines and be talking about autism caused by stuff happening in the gut and to see it now mainstream news.
[02:09:05.102 --> 02:09:08.103]  I mean, we really are seeing victories for humanity.
[02:09:08.344 --> 02:09:09.004]  The government,
[02:09:09.224 --> 02:09:12.265]  The FDA has come out and said take fluoride out of the water two years ago.
[02:09:12.565 --> 02:09:15.506]  They haven't done it yet, but it is success.
[02:09:15.546 --> 02:09:17.847]  Billy, you've dropped a lot of bombshells during the breaks.
[02:09:18.387 --> 02:09:23.809]  Recap some of what you've said about my generation, your generation, versus some of the new generations, where this battle is.
[02:09:23.869 --> 02:09:28.731]  And Leon McAdoo, jump in here because you're going to be interviewing Billy for a special report we're going to air in a few weeks.
[02:09:30.071 --> 02:09:32.192]  Well again, I think when we're talking about
[02:09:32.995 --> 02:09:39.617]  Most people that we know, the people in our families, our extended families, they don't see their participation in this.
[02:09:40.637 --> 02:09:42.238]  They just feel like they don't even exist.
[02:09:42.678 --> 02:09:53.141]  Well, one of the most positive aspects of the Trump campaign is he connected the dots on those people who feel disenfranchised by the system.
[02:09:53.761 --> 02:09:57.802]  And these are people in my family too, whether you agree with the political ideology.
[02:09:58.732 --> 02:10:04.026]  They sit there and say, look, I paid my taxes, I raised my kids, you know, I've worked hard.
[02:10:05.899 --> 02:10:08.460]  Why am I being asked to carry some additional burden here?
[02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:11.161]  Why are we not having this conversation?
[02:10:11.181 --> 02:10:12.602]  Why am I being guilted into something?
[02:10:12.642 --> 02:10:16.163]  Why am I not celebrated for working 60 hours a week for 40 years?
[02:10:16.543 --> 02:10:22.425]  And you and I have talked about in the past the disintegration of the family vis-a-vis the media culture.
[02:10:23.145 --> 02:10:25.086]  The man is always dumb and made fun of.
[02:10:25.346 --> 02:10:28.668]  Even commercials where people get electrocuted.
[02:10:28.948 --> 02:10:30.668]  What kind of culture are we in now?
[02:10:31.269 --> 02:10:33.349]  It's funny to watch somebody get electrocuted.
[02:10:33.369 --> 02:10:34.250]  By the way, buy insurance.
[02:10:35.790 --> 02:10:58.096]  Again, what can the average person do to not assist something that they consciously or unconsciously are participating in that's actually hurting them?
[02:10:58.497 --> 02:11:01.757]  So realize there's a system hurting you, figure out how to not be part of it.
[02:11:01.777 --> 02:11:03.158]  That's the beginning of coming out of the trance?
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:07.741]  Yes, because then you start to see how you've been deluded.
[02:11:07.761 --> 02:11:11.362]  Look, nobody wants to admit that they've been had.
[02:11:11.382 --> 02:11:13.202]  Let's go back to the wrestling analogy.
[02:11:13.242 --> 02:11:14.483]  Nobody wants to admit they're a mark.
[02:11:14.563 --> 02:11:23.905]  If you go to a wrestling event and you know it's not real, or you go to a movie and know that they're not actually flying in a spaceship next to Quantar or whatever, you're part of the game.
[02:11:24.145 --> 02:11:25.066]  You're laughing along.
[02:11:25.146 --> 02:11:25.806]  It's clandestine.
[02:11:25.826 --> 02:11:26.566]  What's that?
[02:11:26.766 --> 02:11:27.246]  Clandestine.
[02:11:27.366 --> 02:11:27.726]  Thank you.
[02:11:29.507 --> 02:11:31.087]  But a lot of people literally think it's real.
[02:11:31.127 --> 02:11:32.788]  I guess, so... Wait, stop.
[02:11:33.396 --> 02:11:39.599]  So when they watch the political system playing out as it is now, they think that that's real.
[02:11:39.639 --> 02:11:41.500]  They don't realize that that's a CGI.
[02:11:42.081 --> 02:11:45.042]  What's going on in the presidential campaign is just as CGI as anything else.
[02:11:45.062 --> 02:11:45.163]  Sure.
[02:11:45.203 --> 02:11:46.943]  So as the facade drops, what's going to happen?
[02:11:47.444 --> 02:11:58.730]  Well, the people in control are either going to double or triple down on the lie and spend a lot more capital and energy to convince you and you and you and they that, no, no, no, nothing to see here.
[02:11:58.750 --> 02:12:00.191]  You know, use that joke all the time.
[02:12:00.231 --> 02:12:01.992]  Droid, move along, that whole bit.
[02:12:02.532 --> 02:12:02.773]  Okay?
[02:12:03.233 --> 02:12:07.880]  Or, look, once you admit to a lie, you know what hits the fan.
[02:12:08.882 --> 02:12:14.670]  And this thing has been puffed up and puffed up to the point where when it goes, it's going to be very messy.
[02:12:14.690 --> 02:12:15.792]  I agree.
[02:12:15.832 --> 02:12:17.655]  Leanne McAdoo, any questions for Mr. Corrigan?
[02:12:18.052 --> 02:12:29.054]  Well, I just think, I mean, on that note of contributing to certain social systems and things, Twitter, for instance, it has the ability to meet a lot of, connect a lot of people and create these movements.
[02:12:29.454 --> 02:12:38.636]  But we talked earlier about how now it seems sort of the powers that be have figured out how to control those movements, or they see, oh, the zeitgeist, this is happening.
[02:12:38.676 --> 02:12:40.557]  So they're testing, steering it, sabotaging it.
[02:12:40.577 --> 02:12:40.777]  Right.
[02:12:40.877 --> 02:12:44.657]  And so Twitter, for instance, back in the day, could start, get a lot of people out for revolutions.
[02:12:44.717 --> 02:12:47.438]  Now they just use a hashtag and they're doing their part.
[02:12:47.927 --> 02:12:53.870]  Look, imagine you're sitting somewhere in some central command system, like you are here, and you have access to all the analytics.
[02:12:54.490 --> 02:13:01.814]  And just by pushing a button or removing a hashtag, you can affect the power to corrupt something to reflect your political ideology.
[02:13:01.834 --> 02:13:04.736]  That's a good point, because we can literally start memes and a lot of stuff.
[02:13:04.996 --> 02:13:06.737]  If we wanted to be deceptive, it'd be dangerous.
[02:13:06.997 --> 02:13:10.439]  Right, but Jack, who's the Twitter guy, can suppress the hashtag.
[02:13:10.479 --> 02:13:17.423]  If he doesn't want your certain movement to get any traction, that doesn't have to trend in America, or wherever you are.
[02:13:17.443 --> 02:13:17.743]  That's right.
[02:13:17.803 --> 02:13:23.866]  Okay, for those who know, and you continue to participate in those systems, you are basically saying, that's okay.
[02:13:24.586 --> 02:13:32.711]  And we've blown past so many stop signs in the last seven to ten years, where government spying and all this stuff, and people just kind of shrug and say, well it's nothing to do with me.
[02:13:34.071 --> 02:13:42.933]  Now as the system is doubling and tripling down on its systems of control, people are going to have to either recognize that they're part of a system or they're going to want to continue in their particular trance.
[02:13:43.254 --> 02:13:49.395]  We're talking to the people who intuitively feel uncomfortable with the system as it exists.
[02:13:49.435 --> 02:13:54.076]  They know that it's not going to add up to be the world and the society that they want their children to grow up in.
[02:13:54.136 --> 02:13:56.397]  So we need to organize and say we want to change the system.
[02:13:57.185 --> 02:14:00.826]  I think you need to identify those things that are very simple for people to do.
[02:14:01.006 --> 02:14:08.689]  Democratize the big blocks like Google and Facebook and Twitter and Apple and say, realize you're feeding us the agenda we want.
[02:14:08.929 --> 02:14:11.870]  Just admitting there's an agenda is the beginning of change.
[02:14:12.290 --> 02:14:15.173]  Or like Matt Drudge said, get out of these internet ghettos.
[02:14:15.213 --> 02:14:16.855]  They're trying to corral you and control you.
[02:14:16.875 --> 02:14:18.077]  Well that goes back to that question, yeah.
[02:14:18.097 --> 02:14:21.440]  Okay, so what do you say to the soccer dad?
[02:14:22.061 --> 02:14:23.002]  To be a PC here.
[02:14:23.022 --> 02:14:23.963]  Okay, now it's a soccer dad.
[02:14:24.003 --> 02:14:24.944]  We've covered everybody.
[02:14:25.245 --> 02:14:26.386]  A soccer person.
[02:14:26.586 --> 02:14:27.527]  Thank you, a soccer person.
[02:14:27.547 --> 02:14:28.148]  A purple penguin.
[02:14:28.488 --> 02:14:29.389]  Thank you, a purple penguin.
[02:14:29.409 --> 02:14:30.531]  I'm sorry, it's a purple penguin.
[02:14:31.624 --> 02:14:32.465]  At a soccer game.
[02:14:32.645 --> 02:14:39.810]  What do you say to the purple penguin who still wants to be on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram because they like... Look how you use the word I say now.
[02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:40.570]  I like that power.
[02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:42.331]  I say it's a green penguin now.
[02:14:42.972 --> 02:14:44.313]  This week, change it.
[02:14:44.373 --> 02:14:45.353]  You tell me the code words.
[02:14:45.393 --> 02:14:47.655]  Green penguin are your races.
[02:14:48.075 --> 02:14:49.096]  I don't want to offend anybody.
[02:14:50.077 --> 02:14:51.538]  I have to love everyone now, right?
[02:14:52.631 --> 02:14:59.294]  What do you say to that person who says, yes I understand what you're saying Alex, yes I understand what you're saying Leanne, but I still want to participate in the system.
[02:14:59.794 --> 02:15:05.897]  You've got to give them more information so they can make a decision based on their own self-interest.
[02:15:07.244 --> 02:15:10.465]  When you talk about big picture stuff, not everybody can relate.
[02:15:10.545 --> 02:15:12.006]  It's too big a picture for them.
[02:15:12.386 --> 02:15:14.247]  Well, I think they need to realize big picture.
[02:15:14.267 --> 02:15:15.827]  More freedom for everybody means more freedom for them.
[02:15:15.847 --> 02:15:17.568]  And I'm not insulting anybody's intelligence.
[02:15:17.588 --> 02:15:18.008]  No, I agree.
[02:15:18.348 --> 02:15:20.049]  I am not a professional NFL quarterback.
[02:15:20.229 --> 02:15:24.190]  I can't see what Peyton Manning sees on the field in the last play of the Super Bowl.
[02:15:24.671 --> 02:15:25.111]  He spent
[02:15:26.692 --> 02:15:31.095]  57,000 hours studying film so he can see that that guy's gonna break open where you and I wouldn't, okay?
[02:15:31.476 --> 02:15:36.660]  You and I have spent 57,000 hours examining certain parts of the entertainment or the governmental structure.
[02:15:36.700 --> 02:15:39.242]  We can see things breaking long before anybody else can.
[02:15:39.903 --> 02:15:42.285]  That's why somebody like Roger Stone at this point is so informative.
[02:15:42.845 --> 02:15:47.609]  Not only for what his intel on the Trump inner machinations, but how he sees the political system.
[02:15:47.629 --> 02:15:50.451]  What I like about him is he's always told me the truth and it's all come true.
[02:15:50.731 --> 02:15:52.313]  Most politicos like lying spin.
[02:15:52.353 --> 02:15:53.314]  That guy is amazing.
[02:15:56.237 --> 02:16:03.399]  I like listening to somebody like Roger Stone because he gives me that quarterback read on the field at the actual street level of the politics.
[02:16:03.659 --> 02:16:05.620]  And he actually gives you what the quarterback is really saying.
[02:16:05.900 --> 02:16:08.380]  Most politicos lie to you about what they're saying.
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:12.062]  So that's why I like this idea of what we discussed behind the scenes.
[02:16:12.082 --> 02:16:13.062]  We'll wait to reveal.
[02:16:13.762 --> 02:16:18.985]  That's why I like the idea so that we can give people that read on the field at a cultural level.
[02:16:19.365 --> 02:16:21.066]  So they can see when they click... I want to do it.
[02:16:21.086 --> 02:16:22.046]  Let's make sure it happens.
[02:16:22.066 --> 02:16:28.389]  When they click on so-and-so rips so-and-so and they click on that, they have to understand the actual cost of that.
[02:16:28.409 --> 02:16:33.792]  And we're going to teach them the read and from a professional view what we've learned and show them how they're being manipulated.
[02:16:33.872 --> 02:16:35.532]  That is true empowerment.
[02:16:35.893 --> 02:16:37.914]  You talk about... I've always wanted to analyze the propaganda.
[02:16:37.934 --> 02:16:38.254]  You're right.
[02:16:38.294 --> 02:16:40.435]  And like 80% of the propaganda is in
[02:16:41.135 --> 02:16:41.716]  Entertainment.
[02:16:42.256 --> 02:16:46.300]  I wrote you that day because you say a lot of things in your rants.
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:46.760]  Babbling.
[02:16:46.900 --> 02:16:47.481]  In your babbling.
[02:16:48.261 --> 02:16:49.562]  Your Green Penguin rambling.
[02:16:50.103 --> 02:16:53.666]  You say a lot of things and sometimes you flip past them because it's coming at you so fast.
[02:16:53.906 --> 02:16:56.789]  It's like you see the sign, you comment, and you move on to the next thing.
[02:16:57.189 --> 02:17:08.199]  That day that you said 80-90% of the propagandizing is in the media entertainment complex, that was one of the most dead on things you've ever said.
[02:17:09.401 --> 02:17:12.102]  That is the route where most people live.
[02:17:12.323 --> 02:17:14.304]  And I'm stating the obvious, but no one's talking about it.
[02:17:14.324 --> 02:17:18.626]  Why do you think the politic game is being presented like it's just another reality show?
[02:17:19.366 --> 02:17:20.006]  Beauty pageant.
[02:17:20.106 --> 02:17:24.489]  Why, when Trump would blow up Megyn Kelly, why would they have him back on the next morning?
[02:17:24.509 --> 02:17:26.570]  Because it's pound for pound dollar.
[02:17:27.714 --> 02:17:29.235]  Well, we're almost out of time.
[02:17:29.255 --> 02:17:30.456]  I know you and Leigh-Anne are going to do an interview.
[02:17:30.476 --> 02:17:31.878]  You've been very gracious with your time.
[02:17:32.318 --> 02:17:33.279]  You're playing tonight in Austin.
[02:17:33.299 --> 02:17:34.280]  I know you're playing all over the country.
[02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:37.523]  Folks can find out about the tour at Smashing Pumpkins.
[02:17:37.703 --> 02:17:38.243]  Thanks for coming.
[02:17:38.383 --> 02:17:41.226]  And you will be playing Houston tomorrow, even after their devastation.
[02:17:41.266 --> 02:17:42.107]  As far as I know, yeah.
[02:17:42.127 --> 02:17:44.309]  Fans have been asking about Houston because of what's going on with the weather.
[02:17:44.349 --> 02:17:45.750]  The flooding is amazing here.
[02:17:47.538 --> 02:17:48.599]  Uh, we've got two minutes left.
[02:17:48.619 --> 02:17:50.340]  Lean in a couple questions, because I know you're about to do an interview.
[02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:55.564]  Well, I think it's just interesting to, as you were saying, you know, forgive people who are still sort of in this trance.
[02:17:55.804 --> 02:17:56.945]  Look at what they're up against.
[02:17:57.365 --> 02:17:59.667]  Even with everything going on with this, with the delegate rigging.
[02:17:59.847 --> 02:18:01.108]  They're set in front of a TV at bars.
[02:18:01.128 --> 02:18:02.389]  That's totally normal.
[02:18:02.569 --> 02:18:04.550]  Your vote, yeah, your vote doesn't count.
[02:18:04.670 --> 02:18:10.575]  Trump's so stupid for not understanding how the delegate rigging, like they're just selling it, that this is, it's normal.
[02:18:10.595 --> 02:18:10.915]  Okay, look.
[02:18:12.296 --> 02:18:15.098]  Trump is known to most people because he was on a TV show.
[02:18:15.859 --> 02:18:16.139]  His
[02:18:17.605 --> 02:18:18.686]  He's obviously a smarter communicator.
[02:18:27.532 --> 02:18:29.834]  At the business level than he is, the way he talks.
[02:18:29.954 --> 02:18:32.536]  Like, when you watch his speeches, it's like, it's all soundbites.
[02:18:33.017 --> 02:18:33.197]  Right?
[02:18:33.357 --> 02:18:35.639]  So he's understood and he understands that patois.
[02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:41.264]  So, that's why the media is presenting those things like, oh hey, your vote doesn't count, let's move on.
[02:18:41.584 --> 02:18:44.847]  Because that is literally the next installment of the reality show.
[02:18:44.867 --> 02:18:45.067]  Right.
[02:18:45.307 --> 02:18:46.688]  It's just another installment of the reality show.
[02:18:46.909 --> 02:18:49.351]  Tune in next to find out whether or not your vote does matter.
[02:18:49.691 --> 02:18:49.911]  Yeah.
[02:18:50.011 --> 02:18:50.252]  You know?
[02:18:50.272 --> 02:18:51.853]  Let me ask you this, why are they so scared of Trump?
[02:18:55.410 --> 02:19:05.196]  Well, I mean, the simplest argument to me is that he is a true outlier in the dangerous sense of he won't play by any particular rule.
[02:19:05.877 --> 02:19:06.757]  But he knows the game.
[02:19:07.878 --> 02:19:09.279]  Maybe he does and maybe he doesn't.
[02:19:10.079 --> 02:19:12.481]  Maybe he just tapped into the zeitgeist and he doesn't even know.
[02:19:13.168 --> 02:19:15.549]  Maybe you just tune into this show one too many times.
[02:19:15.569 --> 02:19:18.371]  That's really what happened.
[02:19:18.511 --> 02:19:19.372]  I'm sorry.
[02:19:19.432 --> 02:19:21.493]  Let's be real simple here for the sake of argument.
[02:19:21.893 --> 02:19:23.194]  We all belong to a club.
[02:19:23.374 --> 02:19:24.234]  A clique of friends.
[02:19:24.755 --> 02:19:25.155]  A team.
[02:19:25.435 --> 02:19:26.456]  And here comes the newcomer.
[02:19:26.536 --> 02:19:29.818]  And they say, we don't know if we want you on our team because you're going to mess up our dynamic.
[02:19:30.278 --> 02:19:31.519]  He messes up their dynamic.
[02:19:31.559 --> 02:19:32.299]  We've paid our dues.
[02:19:32.319 --> 02:19:33.560]  We hijacked and took over the world.
[02:19:33.580 --> 02:19:34.280]  Who do you think you are?
[02:19:35.561 --> 02:19:48.171]  You can literally watch the machinations of these campaigns and the RNC and all that stuff, and then there's the Democratic version too, as they have to keep adjusting their game plans and their strategies to account for unforeseen circumstances.
[02:19:48.191 --> 02:19:50.273]  That's right, all is well, all is not well in Camelot.
[02:19:50.293 --> 02:19:53.035]  That tells you they are not as in control as they like to pretend.
[02:19:53.055 --> 02:19:54.877]  I think I'm going to shut down the internet.
[02:19:54.977 --> 02:19:56.399]  Leon McAdoo, you guys are awesome.
[02:19:56.419 --> 02:19:58.322]  You're going to go do a taped interview with Aaron in a few weeks.
[02:19:58.342 --> 02:19:59.043]  This was all live.
[02:19:59.384 --> 02:20:01.627]  Andrew Wakefield, another great hero, is coming in.
[02:20:02.268 --> 02:20:03.029]  Billy, thanks for the time.
[02:20:03.069 --> 02:20:03.830]  It's always great talking to you.
[02:20:03.850 --> 02:20:05.372]  Thank you, Alex, and thanks to everyone for listening.
[02:20:05.393 --> 02:20:07.315]  And I'm excited about the discussion of a collaboration.
[02:20:07.335 --> 02:20:08.237]  That is very exciting.
[02:20:08.958 --> 02:20:10.120]  Very exciting.
[02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:10.861]  All right, stay with us.
[02:20:18.700 --> 02:20:31.089]  44,000 plus people have evacuated the Japanese town of Mashiki on the southern portion of the Land of the Rising Sun following a 7.4 magnitude earthquake that has killed at least nine and injured 858.
[02:20:31.309 --> 02:20:32.270]  If you have been paying attention,
[02:20:34.451 --> 02:20:40.674]  You may have noticed the frequency of earthquakes being reported in 2016 has been unyielding.
[02:20:40.914 --> 02:20:44.936]  Recently, a magnitude 6.5 earthquake hit Vanuatu.
[02:20:45.276 --> 02:20:48.897]  A magnitude 5.9 earthquake hit the southern Philippines.
[02:20:49.258 --> 02:20:52.399]  A magnitude 6.9 earthquake rocked Myanmar.
[02:20:52.699 --> 02:20:58.164]  And on April 10th, a 6.6 magnitude quake hit Kabul with aftershocks in India.
[02:20:58.344 --> 02:21:02.668]  On April 8th, there was a magnitude 4.2 earthquake in Nepal.
[02:21:02.968 --> 02:21:09.194]  Nepal was also hit earlier with a large 5.5 magnitude quake on February 22nd.
[02:21:09.494 --> 02:21:12.637]  And in the beginning of 2016, on January 20th, there was a 6.1 magnitude earthquake in China.
[02:21:16.360 --> 02:21:23.987]  And sixteen days prior, eleven people had died when a 6.7 magnitude earthquake hit Manipur in India.
[02:21:24.407 --> 02:21:31.754]  Michael Snyder of End of the American Dream writes, Why is the crust of the earth shaking so violently all of a sudden?
[02:21:32.114 --> 02:21:36.578]  Seismologist Ilham of the University of Colorado has made headlines
[02:21:36.818 --> 02:21:44.706]  All over the world by warning that current conditions might trigger at least four earthquakes greater than 8.0 in magnitude.
[02:21:45.186 --> 02:21:55.756]  If his projections are accurate, our planet could be on the precipice of a wave of natural disasters unlike anything that any of us have ever experienced before.
[02:21:55.976 --> 02:21:56.517]  Basically,
[02:21:56.917 --> 02:22:00.279]  What we saw in Japan earlier today is tiny.
[02:22:00.419 --> 02:22:07.484]  Compared to the destruction, Bilham has been desperately trying to compel governments all over the globe to be aware of.
[02:22:07.744 --> 02:22:12.748]  But Bilham has been turned away from at least one country that refused to hear the truth.
[02:22:13.088 --> 02:22:18.712]  In 2012, Indian officials deported Bilham when his plane arrived in New Delhi.
[02:22:18.732 --> 02:22:18.792]  Why?
[02:22:19.352 --> 02:22:26.717]  Bilham had raised concerns about the dangerous seismic activity in the Jaipur region where a nuclear plant was being planned.
[02:22:27.177 --> 02:22:32.640]  Meanwhile, authorities are quietly racing to monitor the many volcanoes blowing their tops.
[02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:38.383]  Currently, there are 38 active volcanoes as the Earth moves through its volcano season.
[02:22:38.523 --> 02:22:42.646]  The World Net Daily writes, there is a 5% to a 10% chance in the next 80 years, scientists say.
[02:22:45.407 --> 02:22:54.636]  One of these eruptions will kill millions of people and poison the atmosphere beyond the imagination of anything man's activity could do in a thousand years.
[02:22:55.036 --> 02:22:59.900]  And no one is yet making any plans to deal with the calamitous possibilities.
[02:23:01.142 --> 02:23:03.684]  But earthquakes are earthquakes and I don't know.
[02:23:04.184 --> 02:23:05.946]  Hopefully we just won't ever have to worry about it.
[02:23:06.326 --> 02:23:09.029]  How does that make you feel living here and running a business here?
[02:23:10.300 --> 02:23:12.121]  Um, it just feels kind of awkward.
[02:23:12.822 --> 02:23:14.183]  I didn't know about that fall.
[02:23:15.384 --> 02:23:24.090]  We've had earthquakes here in the last two or three months that weren't as big as this, but I'm just happy that I have a building that I know that can withstand it.
[02:23:26.079 --> 02:23:33.785]  Relatively unknown fault line that was here and you can see where the road has just separated into.
[02:23:34.626 --> 02:23:37.368]  It was pushed up against each other directly in this area.
[02:23:37.448 --> 02:23:41.732]  Sidewalks are about three feet high in some places.
[02:23:43.075 --> 02:23:54.703]  True to California fashion, some of the children have seen this as their opportunity to have their own makeshift bike ramps and skate ramps, trying to make the best of this situation.
[02:23:54.984 --> 02:24:04.010]  All eyes should be on the ring of fire as the trenches activate the tectonic plates at exponential levels and earthquake news events multiply.
[02:24:04.330 --> 02:24:06.212]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[02:24:08.313 --> 02:24:09.554]  Oh my God, we're having an earthquake.
[02:24:09.614 --> 02:24:10.154]  Wait a minute.
[02:24:10.214 --> 02:24:10.455]  Hold on.
[02:24:10.495 --> 02:24:10.735]  Hold on.
[02:24:32.755 --> 02:24:39.541]  Alright, he's with us till 5 after next hour, then David Knight takes over, and he's Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
[02:24:40.382 --> 02:24:43.384]  He has the new film out, going through film festivals.
[02:24:43.565 --> 02:24:50.410]  Robert De Niro chose it for his Tribeca-founded event, and we've had other film festivals, like in Houston and places, threatened.
[02:24:51.051 --> 02:24:58.117]  There were also other pressure put, obviously, on the New York festival, and it just shows the control going on that's happened.
[02:24:58.337 --> 02:25:00.199]  But separately, I'm not going to go through the whole saga.
[02:25:00.899 --> 02:25:03.700]  Andrew Wakefield and his partners have been exonerated in England.
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:05.161]  They came out and said it was all a hoax.
[02:25:05.621 --> 02:25:20.048]  I have a giant stack of mainstream news articles, New York Times, you name it, government studies, admitting that autism and mental illness and so many other things is linked to toxicity in the gut and imbalances, cancer, you name it.
[02:25:20.508 --> 02:25:21.769]  So we're going to talk about this today.
[02:25:21.789 --> 02:25:25.771]  I know he likes to specifically just get into the facts and in his own research study he did.
[02:25:26.631 --> 02:25:35.800]  Wow, they tried to just pick him out as the bad guy because he was one of the trailblazers and destroy him, but it turned out there were British studies before his finding basically the same thing.
[02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:40.544]  So, the fact is they want to distract away from autism from 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 58.
[02:25:40.604 --> 02:25:45.248]  They want to distract from this, but he joins us to talk about the film
[02:25:46.229 --> 02:25:50.251]  Vaxxed, produced right here in Austin, some of it shot here, some of the interviews, honored.
[02:25:50.991 --> 02:26:04.736]  And the fact that their attempt to censor it, I think will cause what we talked about last hour, Billy Corrigan, the Founders Smashing Pumpkins, the Streisand effect, where somebody was showing her house, we don't know what it is, and she complained about it on the internet, and then it became a national news story.
[02:26:05.416 --> 02:26:07.597]  They try to cover it up, so it explodes.
[02:26:08.017 --> 02:26:11.599]  Robert De Niro on Vaxxed, the movie is something that people should see, close quote.
[02:26:12.339 --> 02:26:14.941]  I'm not anti-vaccines, I want safe vaccines.
[02:26:15.221 --> 02:26:17.343]  That's basically what Wakefield's always said.
[02:26:17.623 --> 02:26:18.524]  Doctor, great to have you.
[02:26:18.824 --> 02:26:19.845]  Great to be back on the show.
[02:26:19.985 --> 02:26:24.988]  We've only got five, six minutes of this segment, long segment coming up, but what's the big news in front of us?
[02:26:25.028 --> 02:26:31.293]  I mean, obviously, the cover-ups imploding, the fact that they've got vaccine damage funds, they try to keep secret.
[02:26:31.793 --> 02:26:33.474]  What does it mean that they're trying to censor this film?
[02:26:33.855 --> 02:26:39.499]  Well, Alex, I'm 20 years into this battle now, and it could have all continued the way it was going until one man stepped forward.
[02:26:40.450 --> 02:26:45.015]  A senior scientist at CDC insider saying I was in charge of a study where we
[02:26:45.896 --> 02:26:51.541]  Tested a hypothesis, we found that MMR vaccination was causally associated with autism, and we hid the findings.
[02:26:51.581 --> 02:26:59.908]  We hid it for 14 years, and we have known for 14 years that this vaccine is causally associated with autism, and we have concealed it.
[02:26:59.948 --> 02:27:04.852]  We put millions of American children in harm's way, and I can live with that no longer.
[02:27:05.293 --> 02:27:08.615]  And he came forward, and now the world is... That's right, we have huge whistleblowers.
[02:27:08.635 --> 02:27:11.158]  We've got Merck whistleblowers, CDC whistleblowers.
[02:27:11.818 --> 02:27:18.922]  It was first at ABC News years ago that they had that meeting in the minutes where the head of the CDC says, I won't give this to my grandkids, but now it's coming out.
[02:27:18.982 --> 02:27:20.102]  Tell folks about the whistleblower.
[02:27:20.723 --> 02:27:22.884]  The whistleblower tested the hypothesis.
[02:27:22.924 --> 02:27:24.485]  He ran a study which he designed.
[02:27:24.525 --> 02:27:29.808]  If you took this, if this were a money laundering ring, Alex, this guy would be the accountant.
[02:27:29.828 --> 02:27:33.470]  He would be the last person that you want to be plea bargaining with the feds.
[02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:37.712]  This is a guy who designed the study, did all the analysis, had the data,
[02:27:38.312 --> 02:27:48.117]  And no wonder they don't want your film seen, because he's gone to Congress, he hasn't gotten a lot of attention, he's the head guy, this came out a few years ago, almost no attention, you try to make a film about it, no wonder they want to suppress it.
[02:28:07.728 --> 02:28:10.930]  Absolutely, and now that the film has come out, it's kind of caught them off guard.
[02:28:10.970 --> 02:28:16.633]  They've then put huge pressure on everybody from De Niro right the way across the board to stop people.
[02:28:16.673 --> 02:28:29.740]  They are saying, and this is the pharmaceutical industry as well as the government, don't get it wrong, this is the government and the pharmaceutical industry telling us what we can say, what we can see, what we can think, and ultimately what we will inject into our children's bodies and our own.
[02:28:30.380 --> 02:28:37.764]  There is something gone horribly wrong with democracy in this country, and we've got to seize it back, and this film is now the opening, the door opening on that.
[02:28:37.884 --> 02:28:53.511]  Well, you're admirable, because every time I have you in here, you're at the cutting edge of working with families, trying to put the truth out, you name it, lawsuits, you've just been proven, vindicated in spades, a true trailblazer, I know you don't like that, but a true hero, Andrew Wakefield, you never want to talk about yourself being vindicated, it's always
[02:28:54.051 --> 02:28:58.512]  We have a top whistleblower, the head of the program, hired to cover it up, did all the studies.
[02:28:58.912 --> 02:28:59.992]  He's now gone public.
[02:29:00.312 --> 02:29:01.393]  The media won't cover it.
[02:29:01.933 --> 02:29:04.193]  You're just still worried about the millions of kids getting brain damaged.
[02:29:04.613 --> 02:29:05.513]  Alex, it's not about me.
[02:29:05.634 --> 02:29:06.534]  It's not about me at all.
[02:29:06.554 --> 02:29:09.254]  I'm just a guy trying to do a job and being prevented.
[02:29:09.294 --> 02:29:11.575]  So I'm really just obstinate, but I'm not going to go away.
[02:29:11.615 --> 02:29:12.955]  I'm not going to duck this issue.
[02:29:13.255 --> 02:29:14.335]  It's far too important.
[02:29:14.395 --> 02:29:20.317]  It's going to be, from the estimates in the movie, one in two children born in 2032 are going to have autism.
[02:29:20.337 --> 02:29:21.517]  That is absolutely
[02:29:22.037 --> 02:29:22.758]  Unacceptable.
[02:29:22.838 --> 02:29:27.703]  So whatever the media say about me, whatever the politicians say about me, it doesn't matter because I don't matter.
[02:29:28.304 --> 02:29:32.208]  What matters is the future of this country and the future of this country is its children.
[02:29:32.819 --> 02:29:33.499]  Folks, we're going to break.
[02:29:33.519 --> 02:29:35.000]  We're going to come back and give this guy the floor.
[02:29:35.100 --> 02:29:38.001]  Andrew Wakefield, AutismMediaChannel.com.
[02:29:38.302 --> 02:29:39.502]  We'll give you other sites as well.
[02:29:39.862 --> 02:29:42.804]  You need to make sure this film gets shown everywhere in the film festivals.
[02:29:42.824 --> 02:29:43.844]  It needs to be on TV.
[02:29:44.364 --> 02:29:49.947]  Regardless, there needs to be 10 million copies sold when it comes out on DVD because they cannot stop the signal.
[02:29:50.007 --> 02:29:51.187]  AutismMediaChannel.com.
[02:29:51.627 --> 02:29:55.329]  Right there, if you're watching this on TV, I'm pointing of your radio listener, Andrew Wakefield.
[02:29:55.669 --> 02:29:57.030]  That's a real man, folks.
[02:29:57.330 --> 02:29:59.051]  And decades later, being vindicated.
[02:30:00.399 --> 02:30:01.319]  We're on the march.
[02:30:01.800 --> 02:30:03.400]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:04.341 --> 02:30:07.122]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:11.404 --> 02:30:12.764]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:30:13.025 --> 02:30:14.325]  You can't survive without it.
[02:30:14.525 --> 02:30:15.446]  But where do you get it?
[02:30:15.746 --> 02:30:21.508]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.

[02:31:07.553 --> 02:31:10.395]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[02:31:14.298 --> 02:31:23.883]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by Infowarslife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[02:31:38.610 --> 02:31:38.890]  I'm good.
[02:32:00.034 --> 02:32:02.955]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:32:02.975 --> 02:32:08.938]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:32:24.625 --> 02:32:27.887]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[02:32:27.907 --> 02:32:29.088]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[02:32:29.388 --> 02:32:35.793]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[02:32:36.033 --> 02:32:36.954]  This is sustainable.
[02:32:36.974 --> 02:32:40.956]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[02:32:41.157 --> 02:32:44.479]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:32:44.599 --> 02:32:47.420]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:32:47.460 --> 02:32:48.940]  We're looking at the television screen.
[02:32:48.980 --> 02:32:54.681]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.

[02:33:03.483 --> 02:33:04.544]  And we thank you for your support.
[02:33:18.795 --> 02:33:19.838]  Strange days are here.
[02:33:19.878 --> 02:33:21.703]  Here's the trailer for Vax.
[02:33:21.743 --> 02:33:26.415]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.697 --> 02:33:36.957]  The film I don't want you to see.
[02:33:36.997 --> 02:33:39.638]  My phone rings and it's Dr. William Thompson.
[02:33:40.339 --> 02:33:42.099]  You and I don't know each other very well.
[02:33:42.620 --> 02:33:46.621]  You have a son with autism and I have great shame now.
[02:33:47.041 --> 02:33:57.285]  There's a whistleblower from the CDC who's going to come out and say that the CDC had committed fraud on the MMR study and that they knew that vaccines were actually causing autism.
[02:33:57.945 --> 02:34:01.206]  My oldest son, Ian, was walking and running.
[02:34:01.706 --> 02:34:04.247]  After the vaccine, he was no longer able to do that.
[02:34:05.048 --> 02:34:09.969]  So I called the clinic and I said, I think my child's had adverse reaction to those shots.
[02:34:10.269 --> 02:34:11.690]  And then came the headbang.
[02:34:12.050 --> 02:34:15.271]  The constant banging against anything that he could find.
[02:34:15.431 --> 02:34:19.953]  Right now, I'm sitting in a very pretty position in terms of providing you a lot of information.
[02:34:20.421 --> 02:34:23.283]  The first thing that Thompson did was to plot a graph.
[02:34:23.503 --> 02:34:28.646]  Now, if there's no link between early MMR and autism, those two lines should track together.
[02:34:29.086 --> 02:34:31.808]  And they do track together, until they get to 15 months.
[02:34:32.048 --> 02:34:34.809]  Then they separate, and they continue to separate thereafter.
[02:34:35.310 --> 02:34:39.792]  And they sliced and diced the data in an effort to get rid of that effect.
[02:34:40.352 --> 02:34:45.335]  The relative risk of receiving an autism diagnosis was astronomical.
[02:34:45.675 --> 02:34:45.856]  Wow.
[02:34:46.856 --> 02:34:52.019]  The CDC had known all along there was this MMR autism risk.
[02:34:54.601 --> 02:35:00.164]  In CDC's judgment, the best public policy is to continue vaccination unchanged.
[02:35:00.284 --> 02:35:09.169]  You who run our health agencies in this country, you have an obligation to make sure that these studies are complete, thorough, so that we have all the facts.
[02:35:09.389 --> 02:35:13.252]  Oh my god, I cannot believe we did what we did.
[02:35:13.272 --> 02:35:14.953]  Um, but we did.
[02:35:15.905 --> 02:35:17.286]  Omission of crucial data.
[02:35:17.866 --> 02:35:19.286]  Destruction of documents.
[02:35:20.047 --> 02:35:21.247]  Misleading the Congress.
[02:35:22.008 --> 02:35:24.769]  Grievous harm to innocent children.
[02:35:26.089 --> 02:35:32.272]  Everything I've been telling my patients for the last 10 years has been based on a lie and a cover-up.
[02:35:32.932 --> 02:35:37.254]  Parents should be able to count on federal agencies to tell them the truth.
[02:35:38.739 --> 02:35:44.960]  In 1978, the prevalence of autism was about 1 in 15,000 children.
[02:35:45.300 --> 02:35:54.582]  If we assume that things are going to continue as they have, we can predict that by 2032, 80% of the boys born will end up on the autism spectrum.
[02:35:55.443 --> 02:35:57.223]  Half the children, 80% of the boys.
[02:35:57.543 --> 02:36:02.404]  It's a vast number of children who are being diagnosed with autism every day.
[02:36:03.144 --> 02:36:06.185]  This is going to be a complete catastrophe if we just let it happen.
[02:36:10.225 --> 02:36:16.110]  What are they going to do when one in two or one in three in the next decade or so is brain damaged?
[02:36:16.210 --> 02:36:16.770]  What are they going to do?
[02:36:16.790 --> 02:36:17.831]  The cover-up's not going to work.
[02:36:17.851 --> 02:36:21.614]  And obviously it's a cocktail of pesticides and everything, but they've linked it.
[02:36:21.634 --> 02:36:27.999]  I've got a stack of New York Times, you name it, to gut flora problems and viral infections and brain damage.
[02:36:28.019 --> 02:36:29.860]  It's in the New York Times now.
[02:36:29.920 --> 02:36:34.564]  And Dr. Wakefield pioneered the research that he learned government had already secretly done.
[02:36:35.285 --> 02:36:36.406]  He's here to break it down.
[02:36:36.546 --> 02:36:38.127]  AutismMediaChannel.com.
[02:36:38.167 --> 02:36:38.968]  The film is vaxxed.
[02:36:39.688 --> 02:36:44.034]  Robert De Niro, under pressure, cancelled showing at Tribeca, but says everyone should see it.
[02:36:44.094 --> 02:36:47.539]  Government officials have threatened other film festivals to shut it down.
[02:36:49.241 --> 02:36:54.168]  All of this is going on, and they don't even want folks to know there's ways to mitigate it.
[02:36:54.308 --> 02:36:55.409]  So, look, here's the deal.
[02:36:56.246 --> 02:37:00.949]  Why are so many Democrat and Republican Congress people going out saying, we should investigate?
[02:37:01.049 --> 02:37:04.951]  Why are their CDC high-level whistleblowers going public?
[02:37:05.691 --> 02:37:16.878]  Because it doesn't matter how much propaganda you buy into, when your 18-month-old gets that third round of shots, and boys don't have the blood-brain barrier, and it's mainly boys, 80% or so, and they don't ever talk again.
[02:37:17.878 --> 02:37:20.380]  And they gotta wear a football helmet for the rest of their life, basically.
[02:37:20.860 --> 02:37:21.921]  It'll wake anybody up.
[02:37:23.141 --> 02:37:25.103]  And that's why this is such a crisis.
[02:37:25.743 --> 02:37:27.364]  And that's the kids that get hurt the worst.
[02:37:27.384 --> 02:37:31.407]  A lot of kids just get other neurological problems, or things that are lesser on the spectrum.
[02:37:31.427 --> 02:37:42.035]  So I'm going to try to shut up, Dr. Wakefield, give you the floor in this long segment we have, 16 minutes left in this segment, then a couple other segments, to break down how historical this is.
[02:37:42.856 --> 02:37:45.778]  Because if you're a radio listener, I could go over these articles for TV viewers.
[02:37:45.818 --> 02:37:50.201]  I'm going to go through while he's talking a stack of mainstream news, confirming what he said.
[02:37:50.221 --> 02:37:54.525]  And he just told me, yes, it's made the film get 10 times bigger, that they are censoring it.
[02:37:55.533 --> 02:37:58.135]  But this is such a big deal, because is it on purpose?
[02:37:58.195 --> 02:37:58.995]  Is it to dumb us down?
[02:37:59.435 --> 02:38:01.397]  Or can they not admit it so they're doubling down?
[02:38:01.737 --> 02:38:05.099]  I mean, what's this really all about, Dr. Wakefield, and where are we going from here?
[02:38:05.139 --> 02:38:20.288]  And how do people get behind Vax and make sure that every person that has children, about to have children, every grandparent, every school teacher, everybody that cares about children, which should be everyone, sees this film and sees all the scientists, the insiders.
[02:38:20.348 --> 02:38:23.130]  I mean, this thing deserves an Oscar.
[02:38:24.284 --> 02:38:25.044]  You're very kind, Alex.
[02:38:25.324 --> 02:38:26.905]  Let me, first of all, break it down.
[02:38:26.945 --> 02:38:29.605]  This film is about MMR and autism.
[02:38:29.645 --> 02:38:34.647]  That does not mean that other vaccines are safe or other vaccine components are not linked to autism.
[02:38:34.767 --> 02:38:41.429]  This is based upon the information provided to us by the whistleblower, so it is based exclusively on facts.
[02:38:41.929 --> 02:38:52.832]  He gave us the analysis plans, he gave us the data outputs, he gave us the meeting notes, he gave us the internal correspondence, showing that the knowledge of this went right to the very top of the CDC.
[02:38:53.912 --> 02:38:58.875]  It went to Julie Gerberding herself, who then of course went on to become head of vaccines at Merck.
[02:38:59.555 --> 02:39:01.016]  So they knew about it.
[02:39:01.056 --> 02:39:02.177]  They all knew about it.
[02:39:02.277 --> 02:39:04.398]  This was a huge crime.
[02:39:04.458 --> 02:39:07.239]  So let me now break down the levels of the crime they committed.
[02:39:07.299 --> 02:39:09.060]  What did they do in terms of fraud?
[02:39:09.221 --> 02:39:12.062]  First of all, they changed the analysis plan.
[02:39:12.142 --> 02:39:18.706]  So, in science, you set out a protocol, this is what we'll do, this is how we'll analyze the data, and we will stick to it.
[02:39:19.861 --> 02:39:25.164]  You do not change that plan when you find an effect that you do not like, and that is what they did.
[02:39:25.324 --> 02:39:41.094]  Then they decided to omit data, and they omitted data specifically on the very high risk in African-American children, African-American boys in particular, and in children who, of all races, children who were developmentally normal to age 12 months.
[02:39:41.174 --> 02:39:42.495]  Exactly the group we've been talking about.
[02:39:42.535 --> 02:39:45.197]  Children who develop normally and then lost skills.
[02:39:46.260 --> 02:39:51.644]  They then decided that they had to destroy the documents in order to get rid of that effect.
[02:39:51.684 --> 02:39:59.008]  Get rid of anything that might lead back to the fact that they committed- Let's remember, you have all the whistleblowers, the documents, this is all admitted.
[02:39:59.329 --> 02:40:01.490]  You only focus on what's provable and it's bombshell.
[02:40:01.750 --> 02:40:05.174]  It's absolutely... We will only deal with what we can actually prove.
[02:40:05.194 --> 02:40:12.762]  And the value of Thompson as a whistleblower is, as he says in the movie itself, I will not give you anything that cannot be supported by the facts.
[02:40:12.822 --> 02:40:14.443]  So we have the facts.
[02:40:14.804 --> 02:40:15.925]  It goes way beyond this.
[02:40:16.025 --> 02:40:18.247]  But look, we don't indulge in speculation.
[02:40:19.088 --> 02:40:23.853]  So then, the destruction of documents, Thompson realized that this would be a felony.
[02:40:24.434 --> 02:40:33.343]  That the Department of Justice were after these documents, that other people were after these documents in Congress, that to destroy them would be a felony, and so he kept his records.
[02:40:33.403 --> 02:40:35.825]  The rest of them thought that they had been destroyed.
[02:40:35.906 --> 02:40:38.829]  Then, they went forward and they misled the Congress.
[02:40:39.629 --> 02:40:44.512]  About the link between vaccines and autism, they misled the Institute of Medicine, the IOM.
[02:40:45.112 --> 02:40:55.058]  And the Institute of Medicine issued a report which said MMR vaccine is not causally associated with autism and no further funding should be put into investigating this link.
[02:40:55.378 --> 02:40:56.399]  On the basis of that...
[02:40:57.284 --> 02:41:08.573]  The vaccine court threw out 5,000 cases of children, plaintiffs, who were in that court seeking compensation for damage, autism following vaccination.
[02:41:09.094 --> 02:41:11.356]  So they were denied their day in court.
[02:41:11.456 --> 02:41:13.497]  This was an obstruction of justice.
[02:41:13.537 --> 02:41:23.986]  So, Alex, on so many levels, this is a disgrace, it's a crime, it goes from being just simple fraud to a felony, and these people need to be held accountable.
[02:41:25.169 --> 02:41:41.980]  Looking at the eyes of the doctors, the scientists, the whistleblowers, they're so alive in this film because these are people that believe in the system and when they finally saw the proof weren't going to be part of the murder of millions of children's brains just here in the US alone.
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:46.163]  Tens of millions every year worldwide in this epidemic and these industries.
[02:41:47.031 --> 02:41:53.415]  Like Bayer, who for a decade knew their Factor VIII was giving millions of people Hepatitis A, B, and C and HIV.
[02:41:53.775 --> 02:41:58.899]  And it came out in those court hearings that they knew and decided to cover it up because that would bring down the company.
[02:41:59.299 --> 02:42:01.701]  But finally it did come out and didn't bring down the company.
[02:42:02.771 --> 02:42:13.579]  Everybody overuses Hitler, but when you talk about Hitler killing millions of Jews and other peoples, and attacking Russia, and killing 20 million Russians, and all these other incredible crimes, people never talk about the Russians.
[02:42:13.619 --> 02:42:14.640]  I'm not even Russian.
[02:42:14.660 --> 02:42:17.422]  I just think about, nobody ever talks about 20 million Russians died in World War II.
[02:42:17.462 --> 02:42:18.003]  My God!
[02:42:18.023 --> 02:42:27.590]  I mean, what they went through, and 600,000 Brits, and 400,000 Americans, and both my grandfathers almost died, just because they almost died, both of them.
[02:42:28.891 --> 02:42:36.374]  I feel an anger towards the Nazis, and then I feel this even greater anger currently that these big pharma people just want to cover this up.
[02:42:36.414 --> 02:42:41.036]  You're looking at one vaccine that, you know, you 20-plus years ago documented was one of the worst.
[02:42:41.577 --> 02:42:44.378]  This triple shot, MMR, Meals, Bumps, Rubella.
[02:42:44.938 --> 02:42:48.660]  But this really is genocide against our babies, mainly our young men.
[02:42:49.180 --> 02:42:52.482]  And then I see it in the fluoride studies, the vaccine mercury studies, all of it.
[02:42:53.062 --> 02:42:59.246]  Blacks, for whatever reason, higher testosterone levels, a little bit different souped up physiology on average.
[02:42:59.786 --> 02:43:01.047]  It's devastating.
[02:43:01.127 --> 02:43:03.428]  Blacks, and you don't hear one black leader pointing this out.
[02:43:03.468 --> 02:43:05.129]  Your film gets into that.
[02:43:05.209 --> 02:43:06.670]  As bad as it is for boys,
[02:43:08.260 --> 02:43:10.943]  You look at the disproportionate towards African-Americans.
[02:43:11.004 --> 02:43:11.965]  It's so sad.
[02:43:12.505 --> 02:43:14.448]  It's just epic what you're exposing.
[02:43:14.488 --> 02:43:15.389]  It's so huge.
[02:43:15.449 --> 02:43:16.911]  It's like the biggest thing I could imagine.
[02:43:17.151 --> 02:43:19.474]  I know I'm ranting, so don't pause or I'll jump in here.
[02:43:19.755 --> 02:43:21.016]  Dr. Wakefield, please continue.
[02:43:21.036 --> 02:43:26.904]  And also, about the general site, AutismMediaChannel.com, the site that everybody needs to visit and retweet.
[02:43:27.424 --> 02:43:29.886]  And just know they're censoring and know they're trying to stop.
[02:43:30.147 --> 02:43:31.488]  You're gonna save children, folks.
[02:43:31.988 --> 02:43:33.470]  Vaxthemovie.com.
[02:43:33.550 --> 02:43:35.051]  V-A-X-X-E-D.
[02:43:35.091 --> 02:43:36.352]  V-A-X-X-E-D.
[02:43:36.792 --> 02:43:38.854]  Vaxthemovie.com.
[02:43:38.894 --> 02:43:40.436]  Dr. Wakefield, the pioneer.
[02:43:40.936 --> 02:43:41.617]  Vindicated.
[02:43:42.097 --> 02:43:42.678]  On target.
[02:43:43.837 --> 02:43:44.318]  Continue.
[02:43:44.978 --> 02:43:47.240]  Well, Alex, the credit really lies with the parents.
[02:43:47.301 --> 02:43:52.225]  It was the parents who brought our attention to this, and it reiterates the fundamental rule of clinical medicine.
[02:43:52.245 --> 02:43:54.047]  You listen to the patient or the patient's parents.
[02:43:54.107 --> 02:43:58.251]  No one knows a child like their mother, and they will tell you what happened.
[02:43:58.271 --> 02:43:59.132]  They weren't anti-vaccine.
[02:43:59.172 --> 02:44:02.316]  They went to be vaccinated on time, and this was the consequence.
[02:44:02.456 --> 02:44:04.057]  All they are doing is reporting.
[02:44:04.157 --> 02:44:05.278]  I want clean vaccines.
[02:44:05.298 --> 02:44:05.959]  You make that point.
[02:44:05.999 --> 02:44:06.340]  I'm sorry.
[02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:06.580]  It's just...
[02:44:06.900 --> 02:44:07.621]  No, absolutely.
[02:44:07.641 --> 02:44:09.402]  This is not an anti-vaccine movie.
[02:44:09.823 --> 02:44:12.205]  It is a pro-vaccine safety.
[02:44:12.285 --> 02:44:15.368]  It is about holding these people... Don't give them liability protection!
[02:44:15.508 --> 02:44:17.269]  Don't put HIV in the blood product!
[02:44:17.309 --> 02:44:18.711]  Just don't screw us over!
[02:44:19.071 --> 02:44:21.973]  Yeah, and you talk about the sort of major crimes against humanity.
[02:44:22.013 --> 02:44:28.299]  This is so many worse in many ways because these people were sworn professionally and morally... Hippocratic oath.
[02:44:28.319 --> 02:44:28.960]  ...to protect.
[02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:39.303]  These children, it wasn't that they were your sworn enemies, they were actually meant to be on your side, and that for me makes it so much worse, because millions of children have been put in harm's way.
[02:44:39.483 --> 02:44:52.408]  If these data had emerged at the time, and they said, we're really sorry, we found an effect, we didn't, we weren't aware of it, but now we will do the right thing, we will do a bigger, better study to confirm whether it's true, and in the meantime, we will delay
[02:44:52.848 --> 02:44:57.809]  Just delay the MMR vaccination until after three years and then we might reduce the risk of this problem.
[02:44:57.829 --> 02:44:58.589]  Like Japan did?
[02:44:58.869 --> 02:45:00.830]  Absolutely, and they did not do that.
[02:45:00.910 --> 02:45:06.031]  Instead, they took the option of covering it up and putting all of these children at risk.
[02:45:06.171 --> 02:45:12.593]  Had they done their job at the time, the studies would have been done and we would now know where we are.
[02:45:13.133 --> 02:45:13.593]  We do not.
[02:45:13.673 --> 02:45:18.434]  We are operating from an extraordinary position of ignorance in respect of vaccine safety.
[02:45:20.050 --> 02:45:20.991]  You know, I have children.
[02:45:21.011 --> 02:45:25.777]  I have three children, and they're 13, 11, and 8.
[02:45:26.758 --> 02:45:28.300]  I know a learned immunity is real.
[02:45:28.460 --> 02:45:29.461]  I know there's a science.
[02:45:29.621 --> 02:45:30.702]  I know it's 500 years old.
[02:45:30.762 --> 02:45:31.303]  Smallpox.
[02:45:32.024 --> 02:45:34.747]  You know, back in England and back in Germany, they were doing it in France.
[02:45:35.367 --> 02:45:36.689]  There was a benefit.
[02:45:37.210 --> 02:45:38.471]  There was a negative.
[02:45:38.571 --> 02:45:40.033]  You did a cost-benefit analysis.
[02:45:41.693 --> 02:45:44.076]  I just want them to have liability like all the other companies.
[02:45:44.196 --> 02:45:45.737]  I want to make the choice.
[02:45:45.797 --> 02:45:46.918]  I don't want to be made to do it.
[02:45:47.339 --> 02:45:48.200]  Things like tetanus.
[02:45:48.340 --> 02:45:55.467]  I mean, you know, I cut my finger off ten years ago helping people with their boat on fire on Lake Travis and I fell off and cut my finger off.
[02:45:55.688 --> 02:46:03.375]  They reattached it but, you know, I went ahead and did this, you know, looked at it, tried to get one of the safer companies, you know, did a tetanus shot because I know that's a real issue.
[02:46:04.056 --> 02:46:10.482]  I understand it's a real technology, but don't lie to us and tell us there's no negative end and then just give these companies cover.
[02:46:10.883 --> 02:46:11.763]  But it goes beyond that.
[02:46:11.883 --> 02:46:16.908]  They know the Gardasil shot 10 years ago in studies in Texas and around the U.S.
[02:46:17.028 --> 02:46:18.850]  was causing deaths in autoimmune responses.
[02:46:19.130 --> 02:46:21.252]  They know it doesn't protect against human papilloma.
[02:46:21.272 --> 02:46:22.233]  It says it in the insert.
[02:46:22.453 --> 02:46:23.494]  There's thousands of strains.
[02:46:24.557 --> 02:46:26.478]  Four to ten, depending on the vaccine.
[02:46:26.919 --> 02:46:31.382]  Now they're injecting all of Latin America with it, directly linked to infertility.
[02:46:31.702 --> 02:46:41.169]  I know you've been attacked because you were so professional and had such great credits and were such a... They were scared of you because you're a handsome, smart doctor who pioneered things.
[02:46:41.550 --> 02:46:43.231]  Mr. Superman.
[02:46:43.631 --> 02:46:45.292]  They came after you because they knew you were so good.
[02:46:45.633 --> 02:46:47.674]  So you don't want to speculate, but it's not speculation.
[02:46:48.135 --> 02:46:50.757]  They know these vaccines are being used for social control.
[02:46:51.577 --> 02:46:56.507]  And I just look at, say, the Gardasil shot and all these countries that have banned it, I look at...
[02:46:57.330 --> 02:47:00.152]  A stack of articles here we're going to cover in the next hour when David Knight comes in.
[02:47:00.532 --> 02:47:07.096]  New study shows mutated poliovirus may be responsible for paralyzing more than 100 children in the past year, Daily Mail.
[02:47:07.677 --> 02:47:10.459]  NPR, new polio vaccine rollout comes with a big risk.
[02:47:11.139 --> 02:47:14.241]  The entire world has two weeks to switch over to the new polio vaccine.
[02:47:14.541 --> 02:47:16.082]  Here's why they're recalling it.
[02:47:16.763 --> 02:47:18.564]  I mean, there's something else here.
[02:47:18.984 --> 02:47:24.207]  When these companies don't care, when they know it's hurting people, who are these CEOs?
[02:47:25.248 --> 02:47:33.110]  I'll be honest, I'm not a vindictive person, but you mess with children like pedophiles and stuff, I got an instinct to want to see you up there with a rope around your neck.
[02:47:33.530 --> 02:47:33.990]  Dr. Wakefield?
[02:47:34.510 --> 02:47:38.371]  Yes, and people keep talking about, when we get into this issue, what about polio?
[02:47:38.391 --> 02:47:38.991]  What about polio?
[02:47:39.011 --> 02:47:40.752]  What about the benefits of polio vaccine?
[02:47:40.772 --> 02:47:45.193]  And I'm saying, this is not about the vaccine's ability to protect.
[02:47:45.233 --> 02:47:46.433]  This is about safety.
[02:47:46.493 --> 02:47:48.193]  Please, this is a completely separate issue.
[02:47:48.213 --> 02:47:48.774]  How it's made!
[02:47:48.814 --> 02:47:52.975]  Yeah, just because it protects, apparently, that does not make it safe.
[02:47:53.595 --> 02:47:54.155]  Thalidomide.
[02:47:55.216 --> 02:47:59.700]  Improved morning sickness, but it caused the most horrendous... Millions of babies do not have arms and legs!
[02:47:59.780 --> 02:48:00.341]  Absolutely.
[02:48:00.821 --> 02:48:02.603]  So let's separate these issues.
[02:48:02.643 --> 02:48:04.165]  Don't say to me, what about polio?
[02:48:04.846 --> 02:48:06.127]  Let's just separate this out.
[02:48:06.167 --> 02:48:09.611]  It's like statins will make you not have a heart attack, but they eat your damn brain!
[02:48:10.111 --> 02:48:22.083]  So we, you know, let's focus on the issue and this movie is about safety and it's about the lack of safety studies and the corruption of safety studies at the CDC and that is the issue we need to focus on.
[02:48:22.143 --> 02:48:26.327]  It is not anti-vaccine and it's been portrayed in the media here, there and everywhere as anti-vaccine.
[02:48:26.347 --> 02:48:31.071]  Oh, it's like when I exposed the Saudi role in 9-11 and the stand-down which I had from FBI and everybody on the show.
[02:48:31.272 --> 02:48:33.073]  They go, oh, you say jihadists don't exist.
[02:48:33.113 --> 02:48:33.233]  No.
[02:48:33.954 --> 02:48:37.437]  I say they exist, they're getting a paycheck from criminal elements, and that's all proven in the media now.
[02:48:37.717 --> 02:48:39.138]  Same deal, they go, oh, you're just anti-science.
[02:48:39.499 --> 02:48:40.099]  Baloney!
[02:48:40.740 --> 02:48:49.347]  If I can go get some shot that's proven overall to be very safe for my kids not to, you know, die of some bacteria or something that's, you know, drug resistant, I'll do it.
[02:48:49.407 --> 02:48:51.469]  But don't tell me there's no risk.
[02:48:52.069 --> 02:48:54.852]  Me and my colleagues and I were very, very pro-science.
[02:48:55.193 --> 02:49:05.624]  The trouble is the science has been corrupted and now we have a formidable example of the corruption of science coming from the body itself responsible for the care of these children, responsible for protecting them.
[02:49:05.664 --> 02:49:07.346]  I'm all about air conditioning in my car!
[02:49:07.386 --> 02:49:08.387]  I'm pro-science!
[02:49:09.415 --> 02:49:09.915]  Absolutely.
[02:49:09.955 --> 02:49:23.764]  So, we need to completely rethink this because in the end, Alex, the enemies of public health, the enemies of vaccination policy, safe vaccination policy, are the CDC themselves and the people who attrite public confidence in vaccination policy because they lie.
[02:49:23.824 --> 02:49:25.665]  Am I wrong to say that the facade is imploding?
[02:49:26.539 --> 02:49:30.464]  I think it is, and I think that it's amazing how one man can turn this whole thing around.
[02:49:30.484 --> 02:49:33.288]  Let's talk about Robert De Niro, one of the top actors in the world, one of my favorites.
[02:49:33.728 --> 02:49:36.071]  You know, he got backed off, but he at least said, hey, see the film.
[02:49:36.111 --> 02:49:39.876]  And I understand, you know, people are threatening him and stuff, but have you talked to him or your crew talked to him?
[02:49:39.996 --> 02:49:41.358]  I mean, we know he's come out and said, see the film.
[02:49:42.006 --> 02:49:44.527]  Yes, I have, and I feel extremely sorry for him.
[02:49:44.547 --> 02:49:50.390]  Not only has his life been plagued by autism in his son, but he's now confronted with this huge issue.
[02:49:50.430 --> 02:49:53.651]  He did not make the decision to withdraw the film from Tribeca.
[02:49:53.691 --> 02:49:55.292]  It meant a lot to him personally.
[02:49:55.532 --> 02:49:56.252]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[02:49:56.272 --> 02:50:00.214]  The media spun it that he... You know, the decision was really... We're going to skip this break.
[02:50:00.254 --> 02:50:01.715]  It's too important for these kids' future.
[02:50:02.095 --> 02:50:03.796]  Explain to us the whole Robert Duvall, as much as you can.
[02:50:04.156 --> 02:50:04.496]  Tell us.
[02:50:04.916 --> 02:50:05.436]  Absolutely.
[02:50:05.456 --> 02:50:08.157]  Not Robert Duvall, the... De Niro.
[02:50:08.197 --> 02:50:08.938]  Robert De Niro.
[02:50:08.978 --> 02:50:09.938]  Two great actors, I love it.
[02:50:10.198 --> 02:50:13.639]  Anyways, getting back to Robert De Niro and the whole Tribeca deal.
[02:50:13.659 --> 02:50:16.220]  Tell folks that story, because it's key to understand the censorship.
[02:50:16.540 --> 02:50:18.660]  Yeah, it was... The film... They loved the film.
[02:50:18.700 --> 02:50:19.801]  He and his wife loved the film.
[02:50:19.841 --> 02:50:20.741]  They wanted it shown.
[02:50:20.781 --> 02:50:22.762]  It was accepted for the Tribeca lineup.
[02:50:23.222 --> 02:50:26.543]  It was due to play, and then we were told, no, the film has been pulled.
[02:50:27.363 --> 02:50:28.344]  It came out of the blue.
[02:50:29.044 --> 02:50:30.926]  Censorship at a major film festival.
[02:50:30.946 --> 02:50:35.410]  You know, when you start censoring at a film festival, then that's the thin end of the wedge.
[02:50:35.430 --> 02:50:36.671]  It then becomes propaganda.
[02:50:36.871 --> 02:50:42.535]  That film festival is merely an instrument of the sponsors and the message they do or don't want to get.
[02:50:42.556 --> 02:50:44.237]  It's a very dangerous precedent.
[02:50:44.457 --> 02:50:51.799]  Yeah, and what emerges is that Jane Rosenthal, who's his business partner, really drove this issue to have the film withdrawn.
[02:50:51.959 --> 02:50:53.279]  And I think they made a huge mistake.
[02:50:53.339 --> 02:50:56.180]  Because once you censor something, then everybody wants to see it.
[02:50:56.240 --> 02:50:57.460]  You do not tell Americans.
[02:50:57.500 --> 02:51:03.082]  You do not tell people what they will see, think, eat, inject into their bodies or the bodies of their children.
[02:51:03.202 --> 02:51:05.603]  And once you do that, then it opens wide up.
[02:51:05.663 --> 02:51:09.284]  And so we then had much more coverage than we would ever have had.
[02:51:09.384 --> 02:51:10.844]  So the arrogance backfired.
[02:51:11.104 --> 02:51:25.253]  It backfired completely, so he then got picked up by a bunch of film festivals, Houston being one of those, and then the mayor's office puts pressure through sponsors on the film festivals' organizers to ban that.
[02:51:25.333 --> 02:51:32.238]  Now in Texas, for heaven's sake, censoring a film in the state of Texas where we value our... That's a whole other story.
[02:51:32.278 --> 02:51:35.380]  The high-level federal official threatens the film festival in Houston.
[02:51:35.560 --> 02:51:43.584]  Incredible, saying we will withdraw sponsorship and encouraging all the sponsors of that festival to get in touch with the head of the festival to have funding withdrawn.
[02:51:43.604 --> 02:51:44.865]  That's racketeering in my view.
[02:51:45.085 --> 02:51:47.246]  That is racketeering, and again it backfires.
[02:51:47.266 --> 02:51:49.187]  There's a protest outside the mayor's office.
[02:51:49.507 --> 02:51:53.229]  It will show in Texas, and now many, many more people will come and see it.
[02:51:53.249 --> 02:51:55.230]  By the way, I'll rent out theaters for a week to show it.
[02:51:55.270 --> 02:51:56.850]  I mean, anything saving kids is important.
[02:51:57.130 --> 02:51:57.911]  That's another question.
[02:51:57.991 --> 02:52:00.452]  How do we get behind Vaxxed?
[02:52:00.992 --> 02:52:02.793]  Folks are asking, when are they going to get to see it?
[02:52:02.813 --> 02:52:03.954]  Because I know it goes through a process.
[02:52:04.694 --> 02:52:05.455]  Through the film festivals.
[02:52:05.515 --> 02:52:08.737]  When can our viewers see Vaxxed and show it to others they know?
[02:52:09.117 --> 02:52:14.500]  It's now opening up in film festivals and film theaters across the country and soon across the world.
[02:52:14.580 --> 02:52:15.621]  It opened in New York.
[02:52:15.661 --> 02:52:19.623]  It's now just played in California, in Santa Monica, in Pasadena.
[02:52:20.024 --> 02:52:20.604]  We were there.
[02:52:20.664 --> 02:52:22.085]  It's now opening in Arizona.
[02:52:22.125 --> 02:52:24.306]  It's opening up again in New York.
[02:52:24.366 --> 02:52:25.647]  It's opening up in Dallas.
[02:52:25.687 --> 02:52:27.188]  It's opening up in Plano.
[02:52:27.248 --> 02:52:28.789]  It is opening up across the country.
[02:52:28.849 --> 02:52:31.591]  So if you want it seen, then get in touch with
[02:52:32.211 --> 02:52:37.977]  Cinema Libre through our website VaxTheMovie.com and contact us.
[02:52:38.138 --> 02:52:42.042]  VaxTheMovie.com contact and become a sponsor in your area to get this on.
[02:52:42.202 --> 02:52:43.243]  And get the movie out.
[02:52:43.503 --> 02:52:46.607]  And then you call the local papers, they cover it, and you reach your entire city.
[02:52:46.967 --> 02:52:48.349]  This is information warfare.
[02:52:48.709 --> 02:52:51.252]  This is trench warfare against these people.
[02:52:51.372 --> 02:52:52.113]  So exciting.
[02:52:52.433 --> 02:52:53.534]  Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
[02:52:54.625 --> 02:52:57.728]  Looking at this though, again, it goes to the instincts of the establishment.
[02:52:58.068 --> 02:53:00.370]  They always try to block things and it blows up in their face.
[02:53:00.710 --> 02:53:02.031]  Reminds me of The Exorcist.
[02:53:02.071 --> 02:53:09.697]  When The Exorcist came out when I was a kid and there were priests outside the movie theater with placards saying, if you watch this film you will go to hell.
[02:53:09.737 --> 02:53:13.800]  And there were lines around the block and people were saying, I don't know what this movie's about but I've got to see it.
[02:53:14.340 --> 02:53:19.204]  You know, if you start telling people in a free country what they can and can't see, then they're going to go and do it.
[02:53:19.224 --> 02:53:21.486]  They're going to want it twice as much and that is what's happening now.
[02:53:21.866 --> 02:53:27.473]  Well then, what is the establishment thinking to get this cancelled in New York and try to cancel it in Texas?
[02:53:28.054 --> 02:53:29.155]  And then it blows up in their face.
[02:53:29.215 --> 02:53:30.477]  Don't they understand that?
[02:53:31.218 --> 02:53:35.263]  I mean, the media has a 6% approval rating in the Gallup poll now.
[02:53:35.783 --> 02:53:36.885]  A year ago it was like 14%.
[02:53:37.666 --> 02:53:40.149]  Don't they understand they are hated for covering things up?
[02:53:40.874 --> 02:53:42.234]  I think more and more and more.
[02:53:42.254 --> 02:53:50.476]  They're at the behest of their sponsors, largely from the pharmaceutical industry, who are dictating what they will say, when they will say it, what their headlines are, what their editorials are.
[02:53:50.836 --> 02:53:51.596]  And that's a disgrace.
[02:53:51.696 --> 02:53:55.157]  Once you lose democracy, once you lose the free media, you lose democracy.
[02:53:55.177 --> 02:53:57.957]  Well, that's what I'm scared of ever being endorsed by the mainstream media.
[02:53:58.197 --> 02:54:00.638]  But they're so arrogant, they'll never do it, just to destroy me.
[02:54:01.018 --> 02:54:02.138]  They just don't understand.
[02:54:02.178 --> 02:54:08.379]  It was like when I was on Piers Morgan about the whole gun issue, and he's got private bodyguards, doesn't want me to be able to be armed.
[02:54:09.383 --> 02:54:11.645]  When I, he said, no, you're on three segments no matter what you say.
[02:54:11.765 --> 02:54:18.892]  But then when I brought up your sponsors are Prozac and other serotonin reuptake inhibitors linked to psychotic breaks, the insert says it.
[02:54:19.753 --> 02:54:21.595]  They walked in and said, he just attacked the sponsor.
[02:54:21.635 --> 02:54:22.115]  Get him off.
[02:54:22.316 --> 02:54:23.357]  I saw them say it.
[02:54:23.737 --> 02:54:24.278]  He's off.
[02:54:24.318 --> 02:54:25.359]  And Morgan's like, really?
[02:54:25.379 --> 02:54:27.681]  I mean, they do not want that discussed.
[02:54:28.072 --> 02:54:31.295]  No, it's incredible how the sponsors control.
[02:54:31.375 --> 02:54:36.699]  I used to interview with Cheryl Axsom when she was on CBS, one of the most wonderful reporters in the country.
[02:54:36.719 --> 02:54:39.361]  She exposed Fast and Furious, autism, she's a great patriot.
[02:54:39.581 --> 02:54:50.290]  Wonderful, and they would, she said, five minutes after this interview there'll be a call from the top floor saying pull that segment, it's never going to play because our sponsors will pull their funding if it isn't.
[02:54:50.330 --> 02:54:52.772]  So they control the media.
[02:54:52.812 --> 02:54:53.653]  You experienced it.
[02:54:54.473 --> 02:54:55.114]  At first hand.
[02:54:55.614 --> 02:55:01.119]  Testify for a minute or two to that with a great reporter, CBS Newsbroke, so many huge reports.
[02:55:01.439 --> 02:55:02.740]  You were there when she was being censored.
[02:55:03.100 --> 02:55:04.101]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:55:04.141 --> 02:55:05.302]  We'd actually do the segment.
[02:55:05.342 --> 02:55:06.303]  It would go perfectly.
[02:55:06.343 --> 02:55:10.066]  It would go, great interview, and then she would say five minutes later, this is going to get pulled.
[02:55:10.146 --> 02:55:10.887]  I can predict it.
[02:55:11.267 --> 02:55:13.889]  And I think that's in the end why she just decided she'd had enough.
[02:55:14.270 --> 02:55:19.054]  She had to get out of that corporation-sponsored excuse for news.
[02:55:19.834 --> 02:55:32.919]  Excuse me, it was just pathetic that she could not get these... Remember when News Corp knew in government studies that the human bovine growth hormone or whatever was causing cancer and stuff and making girls be like eight feet tall, you know, seven feet tall.
[02:55:34.280 --> 02:55:39.582]  They got shut down and News Corp, it came out in the film, was like, we know it's doing it, just don't report it.
[02:55:39.602 --> 02:55:41.062]  It's like, but it's killing us.
[02:55:41.263 --> 02:55:42.003]  What are we supposed to do?
[02:55:42.560 --> 02:55:55.307]  Yeah, and I think that this is why news outlets like yours and others are really growing and growing and growing because people have to turn to programs that they can trust and they simply can't trust the mainstream media anymore.
[02:55:55.707 --> 02:56:01.310]  But look, I don't have all the answers and I'm not perfect, but I've got so many friends and family that had healthy boys.
[02:56:02.483 --> 02:56:02.884]  We're
[02:56:17.583 --> 02:56:18.364]  I mean, I dumb it down.
[02:56:18.404 --> 02:56:19.025]  I've seen the studies.
[02:56:19.045 --> 02:56:23.371]  But as a doctor, as a guy that trailblazed researching this, why does it hit boys so much worse?
[02:56:23.411 --> 02:56:26.034]  I know most medical doctors say girls are tougher than boys.
[02:56:26.094 --> 02:56:26.675]  It's just true.
[02:56:26.935 --> 02:56:29.018]  Not tougher lifting weights, but heartier.
[02:56:29.518 --> 02:56:31.161]  Gunshot wounds, starving, you name it.
[02:56:31.201 --> 02:56:31.881]  Women are tougher.
[02:56:32.302 --> 02:56:32.682]  Bodies.
[02:56:32.983 --> 02:56:33.684]  I mean, is that right?
[02:56:33.784 --> 02:56:35.306]  I mean, why is it not hitting girls as bad?
[02:56:35.566 --> 02:56:39.909]  Yeah, babies, as girls, babies have a lower infant mortality rate from infectious disease.
[02:56:39.949 --> 02:56:41.351]  They're tougher for some reason.
[02:56:42.031 --> 02:56:51.879]  And when it comes to vaccine components like mercury, we know that testosterone increases the susceptibility to mercury toxicity, whereas estrogen protects the brain.
[02:56:52.399 --> 02:56:59.228]  It's far more complex than that, but there is clearly this sex difference that puts girls at an advantage over boys.
[02:56:59.288 --> 02:57:05.036]  And if you look at schools, going back to an issue raised earlier, about is this just the thin end of the wedge?
[02:57:05.096 --> 02:57:07.720]  Is there a more pervasive effect of these vaccines?
[02:57:08.340 --> 02:57:11.324]  Then what happens if you're just shaving nine points off a kid's IQ?
[02:57:11.384 --> 02:57:12.605]  How long will that take to detect?
[02:57:12.645 --> 02:57:16.369]  And if you look at schools, then it's boys who are failing and not girls.
[02:57:16.489 --> 02:57:18.612]  So is this more systematic?
[02:57:18.712 --> 02:57:21.735]  Is this more pervasive throughout neurodevelopmental problems?
[02:57:21.835 --> 02:57:22.897]  And I think it probably is.
[02:57:23.317 --> 02:57:32.543]  Well, just like boys are hit, or blacks are hit more, the more finely tuned hot rod a human is, studying males and others, that's what it's hitting.
[02:57:32.583 --> 02:57:44.690]  These chemicals, these things are attacking, you know, the more dominant, aggressive versions of the species, the leading edge, and then women designed to be able to really go through more toxicity, more aversion, they're able to survive.
[02:57:44.710 --> 02:57:47.592]  But as you point out, autism rates in women are exploding as well.
[02:57:47.812 --> 02:57:50.914]  We're going to go to break for 70 seconds, come back for the final five minutes with
[02:57:51.334 --> 02:57:54.404]  Dr. Andrew Wakefield, incredible things happening, vaxthemovie.com.

[02:58:11.403 --> 02:58:12.564]  Right now that will end tomorrow.
[02:58:12.584 --> 02:58:13.565]  I've extended it one day.
[02:58:14.025 --> 02:58:20.268]  Super Mel Vitality is just known healthy herbs concentrated with all the estrogen mimickers and things known to block that.
[02:58:20.769 --> 02:58:22.770]  X2 is the purest iodine you'll find anywhere.
[02:58:22.790 --> 02:58:24.651]  The good halogen, you heard Billy Corrigan.
[02:58:25.171 --> 02:58:27.934]  I don't even know, he's a user of them saying he absolutely loves them.
[02:58:27.974 --> 02:58:29.275]  He's a big health nut.
[02:58:30.617 --> 02:58:31.898]  Like many folks are, he loves it.
[02:58:32.218 --> 02:58:34.140]  Infowarslife.com is the nutraceuticals.
[02:58:35.285 --> 02:58:43.911]  Infowarsstore.com is the general site with all the other, literally thousands of products from high-quality radio, shortwave radios, books, films, you name it.
[02:58:44.331 --> 02:58:46.473]  And as soon as it comes out on DVD, we'll have Vaxxed.
[02:58:46.953 --> 02:58:53.118]  Back in 70 seconds, we'll talk about the rollout of Vaxxed, the future of it with Dr. Wakefield, the director of it.
[02:58:53.138 --> 02:58:53.518]  Stay with us.
[02:58:54.058 --> 02:58:57.661]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:59:01.072 --> 02:59:04.353]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:59:04.533 --> 02:59:06.794]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:59:06.974 --> 02:59:15.336]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:59:15.616 --> 02:59:18.957]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[02:59:19.117 --> 02:59:29.420]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:59:29.740 --> 02:59:37.024]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:59:37.224 --> 02:59:39.145]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:59:39.466 --> 02:59:47.030]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:59:47.410 --> 02:59:49.573]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:15.715 --> 03:00:16.596]  Breaking the law!
[03:00:17.036 --> 03:00:18.637]  That's what the genetic engineers are doing.
[03:00:20.559 --> 03:00:23.681]  Vaccines are far beyond what you think they are.
[03:00:23.721 --> 03:00:26.544]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:27.925 --> 03:00:31.207]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:31.227 --> 03:00:32.909]  We've got some British Steel bringing us in.
[03:00:32.929 --> 03:00:36.932]  The real British Steel is here with us, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, VaxTheMovie.com.
[03:00:37.112 --> 03:00:38.813]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:00:38.873 --> 03:00:39.594]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:00:41.076 --> 03:00:48.803]  And the last five minutes we have left, I didn't even get into all these articles out of the New York Times, you name it, admitting researchers find a link between gut bacteria and mental health.
[03:00:49.263 --> 03:00:50.684]  That's what you found.
[03:00:51.365 --> 03:00:52.266]  All of this coming out.
[03:00:52.306 --> 03:00:53.447]  How do people see the film?
[03:00:53.847 --> 03:00:54.908]  How do they get behind it?
[03:00:54.928 --> 03:00:56.610]  You know, I've talked about
[03:00:57.543 --> 03:01:00.525]  You never see, you've got all these kids at Donald Trump, you never see the youngest son.
[03:01:00.545 --> 03:01:02.946]  I've talked to people that know him very well, I've talked to Trump as well.
[03:01:02.966 --> 03:01:06.428]  You know, the word is the son's autistic, just like Robert De Niro.
[03:01:06.969 --> 03:01:08.189]  I mean, the system's got a problem.
[03:01:08.229 --> 03:01:14.733]  If they think 1 in 50-something is causing a rebellion, what happens in a few years when it's 1 in 20, 1 in 10, 1 in 2?
[03:01:15.233 --> 03:01:17.695]  I mean, the vaccine execs, they can't go on forever.
[03:01:18.616 --> 03:01:19.276]  What do you do?
[03:01:19.356 --> 03:01:21.377]  You have no standing army, no police force.
[03:01:21.397 --> 03:01:24.838]  You're either affected by autism or you look after someone affected by autism.
[03:01:25.358 --> 03:01:26.459]  The economy collapses.
[03:01:26.499 --> 03:01:29.099]  And Mark Blacksill makes this exquisitely well in the film.
[03:01:29.580 --> 03:01:31.400]  What happens to our competitiveness as a nation?
[03:01:31.820 --> 03:01:33.141]  Autism's the end of humanity.
[03:01:34.685 --> 03:01:37.206]  It could effectively be, unless something is done to address it now.
[03:01:37.266 --> 03:01:39.287]  It drains every resource you have.
[03:01:39.327 --> 03:01:40.608]  Just take a school, for example.
[03:01:40.648 --> 03:01:41.829]  People say, this isn't my problem.
[03:01:41.849 --> 03:01:42.949]  My child doesn't have autism.
[03:01:42.969 --> 03:01:44.950]  He didn't have a reaction to his vaccines.
[03:01:44.970 --> 03:01:47.111]  But suddenly they find the sports program's being cut.
[03:01:47.452 --> 03:01:50.593]  Or the special program's being cut for the excellent students.
[03:01:50.673 --> 03:01:50.933]  Why?
[03:01:50.993 --> 03:01:52.974]  Because it's all going into special education.
[03:01:52.994 --> 03:01:55.876]  The giant new wings of the special ed.
[03:01:56.016 --> 03:01:57.797]  Sometimes half the school is.
[03:01:58.197 --> 03:02:03.459]  I'm sorry, I hear teachers telling me time and time again, I've been in this job for 50 years, I never saw this.
[03:02:03.559 --> 03:02:09.761]  Now, we have special classrooms dedicated to this, and as you say, special buildings being created for special needs kids.
[03:02:10.201 --> 03:02:15.483]  It is extraordinary, and yet it seems to be completely ignored by the powers that be.
[03:02:15.723 --> 03:02:17.064]  I'm sure it's all accidental.
[03:02:17.104 --> 03:02:19.304]  I'm sure it's not a silent weapon for a quiet war.
[03:02:19.365 --> 03:02:20.425]  I'm sure it's not eugenics.
[03:02:20.465 --> 03:02:22.806]  I'm sure it's not a soft kill weapon.
[03:02:23.286 --> 03:02:25.747]  Well, regardless, folks should learn the facts for themselves.
[03:02:25.787 --> 03:02:28.548]  From your research, MMR is linked to the most problems?
[03:02:29.409 --> 03:02:38.372]  It's linked to many, and we have no idea quite how many, because the vaccine program is now so complex, with mercury in the flu shots, for mercury being given, for heaven's sake, to pregnant women.
[03:02:38.452 --> 03:02:38.612]  What?
[03:02:38.952 --> 03:02:39.653]  That's unthinkable.
[03:02:39.673 --> 03:02:40.253]  They've never done that.
[03:02:40.473 --> 03:02:43.896]  No, for aluminum to be put in there, for formaldehyde and antifreezen.
[03:02:44.217 --> 03:02:50.742]  So it's so complex, it's such a toxic soup that we really have no idea what precisely in any one child is causing this problem.
[03:02:50.762 --> 03:02:57.609]  But we do know that the proximate cause, according to the parents time and time and time again, is an exposure to a vaccine.
[03:02:58.314 --> 03:03:02.237]  I'll be on vacation, I'll be at the movies, anywhere, and you see an autistic child.
[03:03:02.297 --> 03:03:07.540]  Sometimes they'll have two in a family because, you know, it's a genetic procrivity that whatever's in it, it hits them worse.
[03:03:07.880 --> 03:03:08.781]  You tell them, oh, it's genetic.
[03:03:08.821 --> 03:03:13.444]  Yeah, like, you may smoke two packs of cigarettes and genetically you get lung cancer, but it's the cigarettes that do it.
[03:03:14.004 --> 03:03:21.749]  And they'll go, no, you know, he was, it's always he, 18 months old, third round, had a seizure in the office or in the car that night, never talked again.
[03:03:21.789 --> 03:03:22.630]  It's always the same story.
[03:03:23.010 --> 03:03:26.278]  Yeah, as Polly Tommy describes in the movie, it's very, very clear.
[03:03:26.298 --> 03:03:27.079]  This is what happened.
[03:03:27.440 --> 03:03:28.362]  The doctors then admit...
[03:03:29.375 --> 03:03:32.956]  That it's the vaccines and then suddenly the medical records of that child disappear.
[03:03:33.016 --> 03:03:50.420]  Did you, I don't know if you saw it, we did an interview about six months ago, Rob Dew did, and David Knight did as well, with whistleblower head nurses, where they go and they say in the preemie area, they go, okay, we're ordered to give them vaccines, they'll stop breathing and die, and they gear up and get ready with the respirators and the defibrillators, and the kids die and they try to make them live.
[03:03:51.241 --> 03:03:56.782]  And they're like, they follow the orders to like start to commence the execution, but then they try to save them after.
[03:03:57.375 --> 03:04:04.179]  And I saw this the other day, a NICU nurse, a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit nurse, said exactly this.
[03:04:04.199 --> 03:04:15.505]  She said, I can no longer work in there because we are mandated to give these premature, underweight babies the full vaccine schedule and they go into respiratory arrest and I can no longer do this.
[03:04:16.155 --> 03:04:28.154]  Imagine, you've got like 50 little babies in there, and you get the order, whether they're six pounds, five pounds, three pounds, give them a shot, they die, they're dying, you're trying to resuscitate them, and then... Wow!
[03:04:29.457 --> 03:04:30.277]  It's tragic.
[03:04:30.317 --> 03:04:31.018]  I mean, it's sad.
[03:04:31.058 --> 03:04:35.160]  And do I know whether that is the case, whether scientifically this would stand up to scrutiny?
[03:04:35.600 --> 03:04:38.161]  All I know is those studies should and must be done.
[03:04:38.781 --> 03:04:39.642]  But they're not being done.
[03:04:39.702 --> 03:04:46.265]  All I know is Nicky and it's all over the world say, we get the order to give the shots, we try to hold it back, we get ready to try to save the kids after following orders.
[03:04:46.665 --> 03:04:50.607]  Vaxthemovie.com, Vaxthemovie.com, Dr. Wakefield, Godspeed.
[03:04:51.687 --> 03:04:53.408]  Congratulations on a job well done.
[03:04:53.428 --> 03:04:55.149]  I believe you and others are turning the tide.
[03:04:55.569 --> 03:04:56.070]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:04:56.230 --> 03:04:56.530]  Thank you.
[03:04:56.570 --> 03:04:56.991]  Great to be on.
[03:04:57.171 --> 03:04:57.451]  You bet.
[03:04:57.471 --> 03:04:59.013]  I'm going to say bye to you and see you off.
[03:04:59.253 --> 03:05:01.175]  David Knight is coming into the other studio.
[03:05:01.596 --> 03:05:03.498]  Tell your friends and family and neighbors, tune in now.
[03:05:03.538 --> 03:05:04.299]  This is a war.
[03:05:04.879 --> 03:05:05.600]  We need your help.
[03:05:05.660 --> 03:05:06.661]  These children need your help.
[03:05:07.061 --> 03:05:08.183]  Infowars.com.
[03:05:08.503 --> 03:05:11.266]  Special Facebook mentions live of Billy Corgan tonight.
[03:05:11.767 --> 03:05:14.750]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[03:05:15.010 --> 03:05:17.292]  Introducing Deep Cleanse by Infowarslife.com.

[03:06:00.657 --> 03:06:01.257]  My name is Alex Jones.
[03:06:01.277 --> 03:06:06.000]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:06:06.040 --> 03:06:07.120]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[03:06:22.128 --> 03:06:36.281]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[03:06:36.661 --> 03:06:40.905]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[03:06:44.668 --> 03:06:51.793]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[03:06:52.093 --> 03:06:57.837]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[03:06:57.957 --> 03:07:04.121]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.

[03:08:21.340 --> 03:08:23.400]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:08:23.941 --> 03:08:25.361]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:25.681 --> 03:08:29.062]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:08:35.003 --> 03:08:38.984]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday, April the 19th.
[03:08:39.064 --> 03:08:40.644]  Does that have any significance to you?
[03:08:40.664 --> 03:08:42.925]  That has been a very significant date throughout history.
[03:08:43.797 --> 03:08:55.102]  We have, joining us tonight on the nightly news, we have George Washington is going to be coming in here with us live and we're going to talk to him about some significant events that happened on April 19th.
[03:08:55.142 --> 03:09:02.766]  We're also going to talk to him about a fiery explosion that happened as a new president was taking office in 01.
[03:09:04.372 --> 03:09:05.553]  Actually, a terrorist event.
[03:09:05.573 --> 03:09:06.594]  So we're going to talk to him about that.
[03:09:06.834 --> 03:09:09.015]  Now, a lot of people are talking about 9-11.
[03:09:09.275 --> 03:09:15.219]  It is really blown up now in the common news.
[03:09:15.300 --> 03:09:29.029]  It was something that just, I guess about a month and a half ago, when National Review was making fun of Donald Trump, saying he sounded like an Alex Jones caller, because he said, hey, we need to release these 28 pages.
[03:09:29.129 --> 03:09:33.012]  And it was only people who were coming on the Alex Jones Show that were really talking about it.
[03:09:33.712 --> 03:09:37.575]  We had former senators like Bob Graham out of Florida.
[03:09:37.615 --> 03:09:42.539]  We talked about it occasionally, but the mainstream media wasn't giving it any attention.
[03:09:43.328 --> 03:09:49.889]  We had Congressman Walter Jones come on many, many times with Alex talking about the 28 pages.
[03:09:50.029 --> 03:09:51.730]  But you know, it's just a conspiracy.
[03:09:51.930 --> 03:09:53.950]  You know, it's this secret document.
[03:09:54.891 --> 03:10:01.732]  And yet, now everybody is talking about it, except some of our presidential candidates are not talking about it.
[03:10:02.052 --> 03:10:03.172]  Hillary's not talking about it.
[03:10:03.792 --> 03:10:05.233]  Ted Cruz is not talking about it.
[03:10:05.733 --> 03:10:07.573]  And I believe Kasich is talking about it.
[03:10:07.613 --> 03:10:10.554]  I didn't look to see if he'd had anything to say, because you know what, quite frankly,
[03:10:12.173 --> 03:10:22.559]  I don't really know what to make about somebody who is singing in and hoping that he's going to have an engineered, brokered convention where the establishment is going to hand him the nomination.
[03:10:22.599 --> 03:10:23.920]  It is beyond contemptible.
[03:10:24.501 --> 03:10:34.507]  And of course, he's Mr. Nice Guy, Mr. Rogers, really, until somebody, a reporter, gets in his face and persists on asking him, why should we take you seriously?
[03:10:34.527 --> 03:10:37.289]  You've only won one state, and that was your home state.
[03:10:37.329 --> 03:10:38.429]  He got pretty testy about that.
[03:10:38.469 --> 03:10:40.070]  But let's go back to the 28 pages.
[03:10:41.462 --> 03:10:51.265]  We've just had some recent confrontations with candidate Clinton, and she said to NBC News, I'm not going to comment about this.
[03:10:51.345 --> 03:11:02.689]  They got in her face and asked her to talk about the 28 pages, to talk about the bill that says that if Saudi Arabia, the government of Saudi Arabia had something to do with this, that they ought to be liable.
[03:11:03.988 --> 03:11:29.141]  Don't you think that's kind of interesting that a candidate who just last week was pushing the idea that gun manufacturers should be liable for the misuse of their product now doesn't think that we have a right or should know about these 28 pages and probably because she doesn't support any lawsuits against Saudi Arabia if they were found to be complicit in this.
[03:11:29.301 --> 03:11:30.542]  So we have a situation where
[03:11:31.795 --> 03:11:41.702]  If you've got somebody that we're told these 9-11, these missing 28 pages on the 9-11 Commission, document the involvement of the Saudi Arabian government.
[03:11:42.614 --> 03:11:53.820]  And there's 9-11 families who say, well, we want to hold somebody who is engaged in that kind of massive criminal activity responsible because they were involved in that activity.
[03:11:54.420 --> 03:11:55.961]  She says, no, no, no, no.
[03:11:56.101 --> 03:11:57.542]  That really doesn't serve our interests.
[03:11:57.682 --> 03:12:01.744]  Barack Obama says, I'm going to probably veto that because that doesn't serve our interests.
[03:12:01.764 --> 03:12:09.629]  But when it comes to Sandy Hook, if they can go after the gun manufacturers and try to take away our firearms, then they will do that.
[03:12:10.389 --> 03:12:11.550]  That's essentially what they're saying.
[03:12:12.557 --> 03:12:20.159]  When she was asked about the papers, she said, asked about reporters, if she'd read the classified pages, because as a senator, she could.
[03:12:20.700 --> 03:12:22.980]  She said this, I'm not commenting.
[03:12:23.761 --> 03:12:29.803]  She said, I think the administration should take a hard look at them and determine whether that can be done consistent with national security.
[03:12:29.823 --> 03:12:30.963]  In other words, releasing them.
[03:12:32.068 --> 03:12:35.571]  Well, you know, that's also kind of interesting, isn't it?
[03:12:36.212 --> 03:12:42.437]  Because here she's deferring to national security as to whether or not to keep the Saudi Arabian involvement in 9-11 secret.
[03:12:44.261 --> 03:12:46.502]  Was she really concerned about national security?
[03:12:47.002 --> 03:12:52.544]  And she put all of her correspondents in the State Department on an unsecured private server?
[03:12:52.584 --> 03:12:53.165]  Of course not!
[03:12:53.605 --> 03:12:57.626]  But when it comes to protecting Saudi Arabia, now she's very concerned about that.
[03:12:57.667 --> 03:13:01.088]  And listen to the way she finishes the interview here.
[03:13:01.288 --> 03:13:03.869]  She says, if there's nothing there, then fine.
[03:13:03.929 --> 03:13:05.330]  Nobody will be held accountable.
[03:13:05.590 --> 03:13:08.411]  That's a presumption that nobody's going to be held accountable.
[03:13:08.431 --> 03:13:10.532]  We're not going to hold the Saudis accountable for their
[03:13:11.294 --> 03:13:12.474]  Being involved in 9-11.
[03:13:12.634 --> 03:13:13.935]  Because, you know, national security.
[03:13:14.015 --> 03:13:18.556]  But when Hillary Clinton violates national security, she's not going to be held accountable.
[03:13:19.436 --> 03:13:23.878]  Now, we've also had Ted Cruz remain incredibly silent.
[03:13:23.918 --> 03:13:38.722]  As a matter of fact, I saw a video, we didn't have time to put this on there, but it was a very long video because you had one individual journalist who was trying to talk to Ted Cruz back at CPAC.
[03:13:39.562 --> 03:13:42.703]  Trying to get him to make a comment about the 28 pages.
[03:13:43.143 --> 03:13:48.085]  And Ted Cruz, even though he got in his face several times and asked him, Ted Cruz would pretend that he didn't hear it.
[03:13:48.405 --> 03:13:49.546]  He would talk to somebody else.
[03:13:49.666 --> 03:13:59.849]  And he followed the Ted Cruz around the CPAC floor as he's shaking hands and posing for selfies with all these people and completely ignores this guy.
[03:13:59.990 --> 03:14:00.810]  Hi, how you doing?
[03:14:00.870 --> 03:14:01.630]  It's so great to see you.
[03:14:01.670 --> 03:14:02.490]  What is your name?
[03:14:02.731 --> 03:14:03.311]  Talking to everybody.
[03:14:03.531 --> 03:14:05.011]  What about the 28 pages, Ted?
[03:14:05.131 --> 03:14:05.672]  What about the 28 pages?
[03:14:06.957 --> 03:14:07.978]  Well, he hasn't read them.
[03:14:08.658 --> 03:14:09.879]  And he has no comment about that.
[03:14:10.299 --> 03:14:11.180]  I think it's very telling.
[03:14:11.740 --> 03:14:16.984]  I went back and I'm looking to see if I can find any comments from Ted Cruz about the 28 pages.
[03:14:17.004 --> 03:14:23.067]  I went back and I found this article going back to June of last year.
[03:14:24.116 --> 03:14:28.679]  Rand Paul battles the GOP over 9-11 secrets.
[03:14:28.719 --> 03:14:33.923]  They say Senator Rand Paul is on his own again on a major national security issue.
[03:14:33.943 --> 03:14:41.729]  They say the Kentucky Republican has offered an amendment that would declassify 28 blacked out pages from the post 9-11 report on the attacks.
[03:14:41.809 --> 03:14:42.370]  It's an amendment
[03:14:42.930 --> 03:15:04.503]  That exactly zero, zero of his fellow Senate Republican support, that would be Ted Cruz included in that, okay, does not support looking at the 28 pages a year ago and he's changed his position on a lot of things like the Constitution and the Bill of Rights but he hasn't changed his position on this evidently and he still hasn't bothered to read it.
[03:15:04.603 --> 03:15:08.785]  Now going on the article it says, this is back in June of 2015, so today more than decade
[03:15:10.146 --> 03:15:18.909]  After this, only a handful of Senate lawmakers are interested in pressing the issue of looking to see why these 28 pages have not been released.
[03:15:19.329 --> 03:15:22.130]  Of the original 46 senators, 12 remain in the Senate.
[03:15:22.430 --> 03:15:26.591]  Just two of those are publicly supportive of declassifying the 28 pages now.
[03:15:26.671 --> 03:15:28.372]  They say senators like Ted Cruz...
[03:15:29.383 --> 03:15:32.044]  Didn't respond to questions about the 28 pages.
[03:15:32.064 --> 03:15:43.747]  They said in this article, among Republican senators, among Republican senators, Rand Paul flew essentially solo that month back in June of 2015 as he did these things.
[03:15:43.807 --> 03:15:44.547]  Listen to what he did.
[03:15:44.867 --> 03:15:46.848]  He opposed the Patriot Act.
[03:15:47.368 --> 03:15:50.409]  Ted Cruz wasn't with him on opposing the Patriot Act.
[03:15:51.027 --> 03:15:54.089]  He opposed John Brennan's 2013 nomination as head of the CIA.
[03:15:54.590 --> 03:16:01.075]  And just a small group of senators joined Paul for a killer drone-related filibuster.
[03:16:01.095 --> 03:16:02.576]  Okay?
[03:16:03.096 --> 03:16:07.860]  Now, neither effort was successful except to draw attention to the initiatives.
[03:16:07.900 --> 03:16:10.201]  Now, how did Paul get involved with this?
[03:16:10.281 --> 03:16:14.845]  Well, so he only recently came across the issue, that was a year ago.
[03:16:16.016 --> 03:16:22.979]  Of the classified 28 pages, he began to look into the matter after a January press conference by Representative Walter Jones.
[03:16:23.760 --> 03:16:24.860]  Good man, Walter Jones.
[03:16:24.900 --> 03:16:40.128]  And again, he's the one who kept coming on Alex Jones to talk about this and those types of people that National Review, the Operation Mockingbird mouthpiece of the CIA, has continually lampooned as Alex Jones callers.
[03:16:41.349 --> 03:16:47.314]  Walter Jones and Stephen Lynch pressed the issue in the House along with former Senator Bob Graham.
[03:16:47.734 --> 03:17:03.988]  Convinced that declassification was necessary as a measure of government transparency, Rand Paul read the classified 28 pages in early May of 2015, and within a month, Rand Paul championed legislation to make public the content of those pages.
[03:17:04.689 --> 03:17:06.170]  They say the odds are against him.
[03:17:06.250 --> 03:17:08.552]  Yeah, the odds are against him, but the odds are starting to turn around.
[03:17:09.773 --> 03:17:14.978]  And I think a key part of it is now, we can now believe it, because CBS 60 Minutes has done a report.
[03:17:15.618 --> 03:17:16.399]  I'm glad they did it.
[03:17:16.980 --> 03:17:17.280]  Okay?
[03:17:17.400 --> 03:17:20.883]  It's better that they finally covered the cover-up.
[03:17:20.923 --> 03:17:23.746]  It's better late than never, and I'm glad that they finally came around to that.
[03:17:23.806 --> 03:17:27.429]  But we need to understand where these people have been on the issues.
[03:17:27.990 --> 03:17:33.275]  And we need to understand where Ted Cruz remains on the issue, and where Hillary Clinton remains on the issue.
[03:17:33.795 --> 03:17:41.886]  We know that Donald Trump called for the declassification of the 28 pages and was ridiculed as an Alex Jones caller for doing so by the National Review.
[03:17:42.426 --> 03:17:51.558]  And of course, Bernie Sanders admits that he hasn't seen the 28 pages even though it's as a senator he is allowed to read them unredacted.
[03:17:52.506 --> 03:17:53.467]  He hasn't bothered to.
[03:17:54.048 --> 03:17:54.728]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:17:55.289 --> 03:17:58.893]  And he says he won't look, but it should be made public.
[03:18:01.035 --> 03:18:09.525]  I just don't even know what to say about senators who won't bother to look at secret redacted reports about 9-11.
[03:18:10.848 --> 03:18:11.709]  When it's right there.
[03:18:11.929 --> 03:18:15.471]  I don't know what to say about Sanders, Hillary, and Cruz.
[03:18:15.932 --> 03:18:25.519]  I really don't know what to say about that except it just beggars belief that these people would be so disinterested in what's really underneath 9-11.
[03:18:25.819 --> 03:18:27.280]  Not interested at all.
[03:18:29.059 --> 03:18:39.763]  And I can't understand why they wouldn't be interested in looking at trade reports that have also been classified and secret and redacted, like the Trans-Pacific and the Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[03:18:40.203 --> 03:18:41.264]  I can't understand that either.
[03:18:42.332 --> 03:18:44.073]  Of course, we had Senator Sessions who did it.
[03:18:44.333 --> 03:18:52.816]  He tried to educate the Senators who were too disinterested, too lazy to go down and take a look at the massive trade reports.
[03:18:53.276 --> 03:19:01.678]  He put together a summary for them, did a dog and pony show with slides and, actually, he didn't have slides, he had charts that he did in the Senate.
[03:19:02.099 --> 03:19:02.979]  They couldn't be bothered.
[03:19:03.732 --> 03:19:04.773]  Didn't want to take a look at it.
[03:19:05.293 --> 03:19:21.425]  And went ahead and passed the Trade Promotion Authority, which says we're not going to amend it, we're not going to allow any amendments, we're not going to allow any debate more than 20 hours, no filibusters, and of course, we're not going to allow any procedural obstacles to this either.
[03:19:21.605 --> 03:19:25.087]  Once it is presented, it will go to a vote within 20 days.
[03:19:25.167 --> 03:19:26.969]  They just don't care.
[03:19:28.052 --> 03:19:30.575]  That is the apathy that we are presented with.
[03:19:31.215 --> 03:19:38.803]  And as we look at whether or not there should be compensation, and we see Clinton coming after Sanders, we're going to talk about that tonight.
[03:19:38.823 --> 03:19:42.207]  We're going to have live coverage of the New York primary as the
[03:19:43.672 --> 03:19:44.733]  Results are released.
[03:19:44.773 --> 03:19:48.435]  We're going to take a look at what's happening there between, of course, the run tonight.
[03:19:48.875 --> 03:19:54.338]  The question is going to be how Sanders does against Clinton and what they were fighting over this last week.
[03:19:54.378 --> 03:20:02.002]  And we had a gunfight at the Democrat debate, and the fight was whether or not you could sue a company when they haven't done anything criminal.
[03:20:02.423 --> 03:20:08.506]  Well, of course, Hillary Clinton says yes, and Bernie reluctantly begins to agree with her as time goes on.
[03:20:08.546 --> 03:20:08.966]  Stay with us.
[03:20:09.286 --> 03:20:09.867]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:11.297 --> 03:20:27.149]  I've been warning you for a long, long time that strategic elites, governmental and corporate power structures have been digging in for a societal and cultural collapse that will make the Great Depression of the 1930s look tame in comparison.
[03:20:34.636 --> 03:20:42.299]  Now, major university studies estimate that more than 7 million Americans starved to death or died via malnutrition during the Great Depression.
[03:20:42.459 --> 03:20:47.521]  The United States fared better than some nations because we were still agrarian.
[03:20:47.621 --> 03:20:48.742]  We were still farmers.
[03:20:49.122 --> 03:20:51.303]  We were not the urban dwellers we are today.
[03:20:51.603 --> 03:20:52.783]  In fact, the numbers have flipped.
[03:20:53.284 --> 03:21:00.266]  In the 1930s, about 89% of people considered themselves rural and about 11% were urban or city.
[03:21:02.324 --> 03:21:10.353]  Now those numbers have basically flipped with maybe 10-11% being rural and upwards of 90% being urban.
[03:21:10.673 --> 03:21:13.176]  We are totally dependent on this system.
[03:21:13.376 --> 03:21:17.941]  And now a top insurer warns global unrest could go viral.
[03:21:18.602 --> 03:21:20.845]  Violent riots threaten international stability.
[03:21:21.145 --> 03:21:29.694]  Lloyds of London has commissioned the leading risk management agency, Risk Advisory Group, to produce a report analyzing these factors.
[03:21:30.014 --> 03:21:35.300]  The story is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[03:21:35.840 --> 03:21:39.764]  And if you add it into all the other massive preparations that are taking place, it's stunning.
[03:21:40.385 --> 03:21:48.617]  Billionaires in Europe, the United States, and areas like New Zealand are digging in and building multi-billion dollar, in some cases, armored redoubts.
[03:21:49.218 --> 03:21:50.720]  Local governments are digging in.
[03:21:51.181 --> 03:21:55.006]  And then policies are being put in place to shut down half of our power plants.
[03:21:55.547 --> 03:22:02.789]  And cut off our energy and put regulations on farmers that bankrupt them and shut down local industries and jobs.
[03:22:03.070 --> 03:22:04.050]  It's cloward and pivot.
[03:22:04.130 --> 03:22:06.771]  They want us bankrupt so we can be socially engineered.
[03:22:07.151 --> 03:22:10.612]  This is the globalist revolution against humanity.
[03:22:10.872 --> 03:22:13.493]  We have to stand up and say we are the constitutionalist.
[03:22:14.093 --> 03:22:15.394]  We are the anti-globalist.
[03:22:15.494 --> 03:22:16.594]  We are the nationalist.
[03:22:16.994 --> 03:22:18.735]  We are the global pro-human
[03:22:20.442 --> 03:22:21.022]  Renaissance.
[03:22:21.483 --> 03:22:21.903]  Movement.
[03:22:22.403 --> 03:22:23.423]  Whatever you want to call it.
[03:22:23.624 --> 03:22:24.624]  We're against feudalism.
[03:22:24.644 --> 03:22:25.424]  We're against serfdom.
[03:22:25.965 --> 03:22:27.906]  And we have to get armed with the truth.
[03:22:28.626 --> 03:22:30.427]  And we have to get armed with our own gardens.
[03:22:30.827 --> 03:22:31.967]  And we have to get prepared.
[03:22:32.108 --> 03:22:35.929]  Another part of a solution in closing is to have storable foods.
[03:22:36.630 --> 03:22:38.851]  If you don't have storable foods, you're totally dependent on the system.
[03:22:39.971 --> 03:22:45.833]  InfoWars Select is the lowest price you're going to find anywhere on high quality storable foods at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:22:46.253 --> 03:22:51.655]  Find the very best storable foods powered by My Patriot Supply at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:22:52.175 --> 03:22:56.677]  Find our nutraceuticals, it's also key to be as healthy as possible, at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:22:57.137 --> 03:23:06.840]  And whatever you do, redouble your efforts in the information war and tell your neighbors, your friends, your family, your co-workers, your church members, whoever they are,
[03:23:08.184 --> 03:23:16.150]  Infowars.com has its finger on the pulse of what's happening and is trying to mobilize humanity in peaceful preparation and resistance against it.
[03:23:16.410 --> 03:23:17.171]  But whatever you do...
[03:23:18.510 --> 03:23:21.031]  Let's pray for peace and prepare for war.
[03:23:22.152 --> 03:23:26.294]  And when I say war, I mean the globalist war of famine and economic collapse.
[03:23:26.674 --> 03:23:27.935]  They don't want us to be prepared.
[03:23:28.295 --> 03:23:29.576]  They don't want us to be independent.
[03:23:29.976 --> 03:23:31.957]  I hope we never have to use our storable foods.
[03:23:32.398 --> 03:23:34.519]  I hope we never have to defend ourselves with the Second Amendment.
[03:23:35.139 --> 03:23:42.123]  But now it's becoming a probability, almost a certainty, and not just the possibility it was 21 years ago when I first got on air.
[03:23:42.843 --> 03:23:45.084]  Everybody in their gut knows big stuff's happening.
[03:23:45.284 --> 03:23:46.744]  You can also see it economically.
[03:23:47.044 --> 03:23:48.404]  You can also see it culturally.
[03:23:48.924 --> 03:23:50.725]  You can see it unfolding all around you.
[03:23:51.145 --> 03:23:58.847]  Now is the time to get prepared, and the front lines of true preparedness starts at InfoWars.com and InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:23:59.227 --> 03:24:08.509]  And finally, when you shop with the good guys, you're helping fund the tip of the spear in the information war that's so key while getting the high-quality products you and your family desperately need.
[03:24:20.635 --> 03:24:23.998]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday, April 19th, 2016.
[03:24:24.038 --> 03:24:29.503]  Before we get back to Saudi Arabia and potential fallout from
[03:24:30.518 --> 03:24:35.241]  Releasing the information on the 28 pages, I just want to let you know that we've extended the sale for BrainForce.
[03:24:35.402 --> 03:24:39.484]  We have extended that sale of an additional 25% off our sale price.
[03:24:39.785 --> 03:24:42.266]  That's 45% off the retail price.
[03:24:42.627 --> 03:24:45.649]  That's BrainForce at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:24:46.089 --> 03:24:51.173]  Unlike some energy drinks and supplements, BrainForce uses natural brain activation ingredients like
[03:24:51.713 --> 03:24:52.334]  We're good to go.
[03:25:09.446 --> 03:25:11.907]  I think an excellent supplement.
[03:25:11.987 --> 03:25:13.848]  It helps to focus my mind.
[03:25:13.928 --> 03:25:18.150]  I would call it brain focus if I were going to name it from day one.
[03:25:18.190 --> 03:25:23.192]  Again, that is 45% off the retail price right now at Infowarslife.com.
[03:25:23.592 --> 03:25:24.132]  Brainforce.
[03:25:25.232 --> 03:25:28.054]  I was just talking about the missing 28 pages.
[03:25:29.334 --> 03:25:36.417]  Many of those who are on the original 9-11 Commission have said there was absolutely no reason for these pages to be declassified in the first place.
[03:25:36.917 --> 03:25:37.737]  We need to take this out.
[03:25:37.757 --> 03:25:38.818]  Well, here's the real reason.
[03:25:39.551 --> 03:25:53.320]  We understand that when Saudi Arabia comes out and essentially tries to blackmail people into silence, saying, if you pass a bill to allow people to sue us for 9-11, we will dump 750 billion dollars of T-bills.
[03:25:57.901 --> 03:26:01.224]  This goes back to the power that they wield over the United States.
[03:26:01.344 --> 03:26:07.728]  But of course, put this in perspective, that's about, well, it's not even quite as much as we did with the TARP bailout.
[03:26:08.509 --> 03:26:09.830]  Should we bail out the truth?
[03:26:10.010 --> 03:26:13.873]  We bailed out lying, crooked banks in the financial industry.
[03:26:14.954 --> 03:26:21.219]  Maybe we should bail out the truth, even if it's going to cost us $750 billion that they're going to dump.
[03:26:21.239 --> 03:26:22.820]  But of course, somebody's going to buy those up.
[03:26:22.860 --> 03:26:25.022]  It'll just be the loss of Saudi Arabia.
[03:26:25.982 --> 03:26:26.443]  But this
[03:26:27.822 --> 03:26:38.953]  Lays bare the kind of naked blackmail that we have put ourselves in a position to be subjected to, going all the way back to our involvement with Saudi Arabia and setting up the petrodollar.
[03:26:38.973 --> 03:26:44.598]  And we talked about this a couple of weeks ago on the nightly news, the fact that as Bretton Woods 2,
[03:26:46.817 --> 03:26:55.003]  They came through and they said, well, you know, Europe and other countries were upset about the fact that we weren't really keeping gold behind our dollar.
[03:26:55.043 --> 03:27:02.088]  That was, we're telling everybody, the American dollar was backed with gold, but it was an obvious lie, an obvious fraud.
[03:27:03.028 --> 03:27:10.914]  So they took us off of the gold standard officially, and what they did was they set up the petrodollar, whereby Saudi Arabia
[03:27:11.937 --> 03:27:15.139]  They would agree that they would denominate their oil in dollar bills.
[03:27:15.239 --> 03:27:26.444]  They also agreed that they would take the money that they got for their oil sales and buy substantial amounts of T-bills with the Federal Reserve, our private corporation, our private central bank.
[03:27:26.985 --> 03:27:35.469]  And oh, by the way, by the way, you know, they were going to replace Alexander Hamilton on the $10 bill with a woman yet to be designated.
[03:27:35.509 --> 03:27:39.871]  We've got to find a woman who is significant enough to replace Alexander Hamilton.
[03:27:40.311 --> 03:27:43.313]  But then they said, well, wait a minute, he's got a new play on Broadway.
[03:27:43.913 --> 03:27:45.174]  Hamilton's got a play on Broadway.
[03:27:45.214 --> 03:27:49.697]  We can't take him off, especially because, you know, this doesn't have any white guys.
[03:27:49.797 --> 03:27:52.038]  Dead white guys have been purged out of the Hamilton play.
[03:27:52.098 --> 03:27:53.999]  So, you know, he's a cool guy now.
[03:27:54.079 --> 03:27:55.860]  Let's not take him off the dollar bill.
[03:27:55.901 --> 03:27:59.603]  You know, Alexander Hamilton is now a person of color, according to Broadway.
[03:28:00.123 --> 03:28:03.586]  So let's leave him on and let's get rid of the slaver Andrew Jackson.
[03:28:03.626 --> 03:28:15.518]  And Andrew Jackson, I believe, had been put on the dollar bill simply as a bit of mocking by the Federal Reserve because Andrew Jackson was the only one who ever stood up to the central banks.
[03:28:15.738 --> 03:28:21.043]  When their charter came up for renewal, Alexander Hamilton was all in favor of the central banks.
[03:28:21.103 --> 03:28:22.184]  He was their chief advocate.
[03:28:23.005 --> 03:28:27.166]  When their charter came up for renewal, Alexander Hamilton said, not gonna do it.
[03:28:27.806 --> 03:28:28.446]  Not gonna do it.
[03:28:28.527 --> 03:28:30.987]  So they put his face on the pictures.
[03:28:31.047 --> 03:28:33.148]  Hey look, we got it after all.
[03:28:33.188 --> 03:28:35.148]  And by the way, it's private too.
[03:28:35.248 --> 03:28:36.989]  How do you like that, Andrew Jackson?
[03:28:37.029 --> 03:28:37.929]  You thought you were gonna get us?
[03:28:37.969 --> 03:28:40.290]  Well, here's our way to dance on your grave.
[03:28:40.310 --> 03:28:42.190]  But nobody remembers that anymore.
[03:28:42.310 --> 03:28:45.171]  Nobody even knows that Andrew Jackson stood up to the
[03:28:45.931 --> 03:28:46.572]  Central Bank.
[03:28:46.672 --> 03:28:51.176]  So it's time to just get rid of him, call him a slaver, and take him straight off the $20 bill.
[03:28:51.296 --> 03:29:03.007]  But going back to what they're going to do, they have been supporting the American dollar, making it the world's global reserve currency because they denominate oil in it and because they buy massive amounts of T-bills.
[03:29:03.067 --> 03:29:06.130]  So that's the way they want to threaten and blackmail us.
[03:29:06.250 --> 03:29:07.131]  But of course it also
[03:29:08.072 --> 03:29:09.894]  Verifies what everybody's been saying.
[03:29:10.594 --> 03:29:12.756]  That they have involvement in this.
[03:29:12.816 --> 03:29:16.540]  People who have seen the documents have said, well, you know, Saudi Arabia is going to look pretty bad in this.
[03:29:16.580 --> 03:29:20.603]  And you've got senators on both sides of the aisle, as they say.
[03:29:20.643 --> 03:29:25.207]  You've got Chuckie Schumer and John Cornyn, who typically don't agree on anything.
[03:29:25.948 --> 03:29:31.351]  Saying, we need to hold Saudi Arabia responsible for this.
[03:29:31.531 --> 03:29:39.276]  If they were involved in this and have some culpability in it, then we ought to have the 9-11 families have the ability to sue them.
[03:29:40.016 --> 03:29:42.638]  Except, you know, Hillary Clinton doesn't think so, evidently.
[03:29:43.538 --> 03:29:47.359]  We've also got people like Ted Cruz and Al Franken.
[03:29:47.559 --> 03:29:47.840]  Okay?
[03:29:47.920 --> 03:29:48.960]  Those kinds of people.
[03:29:49.300 --> 03:29:50.340]  All of them are agreeing.
[03:29:50.360 --> 03:29:50.580]  Yeah.
[03:29:50.981 --> 03:29:55.062]  We ought to allow the 9-11 families to sue Saudi Arabia if they helped do this.
[03:29:55.342 --> 03:29:57.943]  And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[03:29:58.423 --> 03:29:58.763]  Stay with us.
[03:29:58.783 --> 03:29:59.383]  We'll be right back.
[03:30:00.524 --> 03:30:01.424]  We're on the march.
[03:30:01.924 --> 03:30:03.505]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:04.445 --> 03:30:07.126]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:11.036 --> 03:30:20.046]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:30:20.127 --> 03:30:28.196]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:30:28.516 --> 03:30:33.218]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:30:33.398 --> 03:30:40.121]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:30:40.181 --> 03:30:47.263]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:30:47.363 --> 03:30:54.226]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:30:54.386 --> 03:30:58.728]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[03:31:15.476 --> 03:31:17.677]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:31:17.797 --> 03:31:24.601]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[03:31:24.822 --> 03:31:28.104]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[03:31:28.124 --> 03:31:29.284]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[03:31:29.585 --> 03:31:35.988]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of energy compounds that are gonna fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:37.069]  This is sustainable.
[03:31:37.169 --> 03:31:38.330]  This isn't going to spike
[03:31:38.530 --> 03:31:41.131]  And you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[03:31:41.331 --> 03:31:44.512]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:31:44.572 --> 03:31:47.613]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:31:47.653 --> 03:31:49.133]  We're looking at the television screen.
[03:31:49.173 --> 03:31:54.875]  For research purposes, whatever we're even doing, trying to learn something or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:31:54.915 --> 03:32:00.756]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[03:32:12.241 --> 03:32:13.542]  You can't survive without it.
[03:32:13.722 --> 03:32:14.643]  But where do you get it?

[03:32:46.573 --> 03:32:47.774]  Stainless steel construction.

[03:33:07.237 --> 03:33:07.497]  Thank you.
[03:33:14.921 --> 03:33:17.624]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.804 --> 03:33:26.311]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.331 --> 03:33:32.477]  I want to move on to vaccines because there's some huge information that has just come out in the last day or so.
[03:33:32.497 --> 03:33:37.061]  There is a new polio vaccine rollout that is going to come out worldwide.
[03:33:38.234 --> 03:33:50.331]  And they are going to give two weeks to switch this over and they want to eradicate, well not polio, but eradicate the vaccine for polio and come up with a new and improved vaccine.
[03:33:50.351 --> 03:33:51.553]  Now what is behind this?
[03:33:52.274 --> 03:33:54.797]  I found this to be extremely interesting.
[03:33:55.678 --> 03:34:01.521]  I heard this on NPR last night and just about drove off the side of the road as I heard these clips.
[03:34:01.601 --> 03:34:07.484]  Now, the NPR reporter in introducing this says, the world uses nearly 2 billion doses of polio vaccine each year.
[03:34:07.764 --> 03:34:11.306]  They're all stored in little vials at clinics and hospitals across the globe.
[03:34:11.686 --> 03:34:16.868]  Now, every single vial has to be destroyed and switched out with a new one.
[03:34:17.349 --> 03:34:18.649]  And it all has to be done in two weeks.
[03:34:19.370 --> 03:34:23.352]  I thought, does that sound odd to you?
[03:34:24.332 --> 03:34:26.233]  Does that sound suspicious to you?
[03:34:27.233 --> 03:34:30.114]  And they talk about how they've been training for this for months worldwide.
[03:34:30.574 --> 03:34:33.515]  Healthy workers have been taught how to destroy the old vaccine.
[03:34:33.735 --> 03:34:35.356]  Sorry, health workers, not healthy workers.
[03:34:35.396 --> 03:34:44.339]  Health workers have been taught to destroy the old vaccine by boiling it, incinerating it, even burying it in the ground.
[03:34:46.018 --> 03:34:46.318]  Why?
[03:34:46.538 --> 03:34:47.659]  They're desperate to get rid of that.
[03:34:48.440 --> 03:34:53.544]  This is what, just a couple weeks ago, I mean they're still injecting people with this stuff, okay?
[03:34:53.744 --> 03:34:57.307]  But now we've got to incinerate it, boil it, bury it in the ground.
[03:34:58.908 --> 03:34:59.729]  What's going on with that?
[03:34:59.749 --> 03:35:06.054]  And they said, here's what's being done, go out to all the independent monitors, visit these sites, make sure that it's being collected.
[03:35:06.355 --> 03:35:07.576]  Make sure that it's being destroyed.
[03:35:08.016 --> 03:35:09.037]  So not only do they have
[03:35:10.606 --> 03:35:14.510]  A destruction regime that is incredibly rigorous, okay?
[03:35:14.530 --> 03:35:20.016]  Gonna burn, incinerate it, bury it, and we're gonna have inspectors to come out and make sure you did this.
[03:35:21.077 --> 03:35:21.338]  Okay?
[03:35:22.233 --> 03:35:31.215]  Now, she says, the vaccine used in most countries, as she starts to introduce this scientist Robin Nandy, she says, it contains a live virus.
[03:35:31.255 --> 03:35:36.056]  Now the virus has been weakened so it doesn't make people sick, but, and goes, oh, wait a minute, says the scientist.
[03:35:36.356 --> 03:35:43.077]  Well, in very rare instances, the live vaccine virus can mutate and can cause polio.
[03:35:44.937 --> 03:35:45.497]  That's different.
[03:35:45.997 --> 03:35:47.018]  Haven't heard that before.
[03:35:47.678 --> 03:35:48.618]  I'm driving along and it's like,
[03:35:49.418 --> 03:35:49.598]  What?
[03:35:49.618 --> 03:35:55.402]  I mean, this is like telling us that the government's been lying to us about 9-11.
[03:35:55.822 --> 03:36:11.653]  And of course, they're not even getting, folks, that's just part of rolling out that whole narrative, getting people to say, well, wait a minute, they lied to us and covered up some of the foreign government involvement of the Saudis and probably the CIA, because, you know, the Saudi intelligence and Prince Bandar have been
[03:36:12.811 --> 03:36:17.736]  Uh, linked at the hip with the CIA since we've been doing this petrodollar stuff and probably before that.
[03:36:17.836 --> 03:36:20.119]  But I mean, you know, they're so intricately linked with each other.
[03:36:20.219 --> 03:36:23.122]  Maybe there's other stuff that they're lying to us about with 9-11.
[03:36:23.142 --> 03:36:26.024]  You know, like the fact that you had two planes but three buildings fell down?
[03:36:27.346 --> 03:36:29.388]  One building fell down, wasn't even hit with a plane.
[03:36:30.285 --> 03:36:32.345]  Yeah, and Silverstein says, you know, pull it down.
[03:36:32.925 --> 03:36:34.166]  And it looks like a demolition.
[03:36:34.506 --> 03:36:39.527]  And the reporters on the scene, even the mainstream reporters on scene, say, wow, that looks like a building demolition.
[03:36:40.207 --> 03:36:44.507]  And then we have architects and engineers who say, nah, it wouldn't fall down that way.
[03:36:45.087 --> 03:36:46.688]  We haven't seen anything like that happen before.
[03:36:46.708 --> 03:36:52.629]  And you got pilots who say, no, you can't fly those planes at that speed, at that altitude.
[03:36:52.729 --> 03:36:53.889]  The air is too thick.
[03:36:53.909 --> 03:36:54.549]  It wouldn't work.
[03:36:54.709 --> 03:36:59.590]  OK, so you got all kinds of questions then that start to percolate out as people start to look at this and say, you know,
[03:37:00.350 --> 03:37:04.572]  That conspiracy theory that the government's been telling people really doesn't seem to add up.
[03:37:04.612 --> 03:37:06.713]  And now we're seeing the same thing with the vaccines.
[03:37:06.733 --> 03:37:09.995]  They've been saying, well, you know, you can't get sick with a vaccine.
[03:37:10.035 --> 03:37:12.396]  It's not going to have adverse side effects like that.
[03:37:12.456 --> 03:37:13.637]  Now they're saying, well, wait a minute.
[03:37:14.097 --> 03:37:14.517]  No, no, no.
[03:37:14.737 --> 03:37:17.379]  Actually, you can get polio from the vaccines.
[03:37:18.419 --> 03:37:22.861]  And they said, well, last year the world recorded about 100 cases of polio and about 30 of them
[03:37:24.212 --> 03:37:26.833]  We're caused by mutant strains from the old vaccine.
[03:37:27.153 --> 03:37:31.295]  The new vaccine also has a live virus in it, but it mutates much less often.
[03:37:31.415 --> 03:37:32.556]  Yes, it's new and improved.
[03:37:32.696 --> 03:37:35.637]  Don't worry, we're not going to have any mutation with this new and improved stuff.
[03:37:36.198 --> 03:37:36.818]  Ain't going to happen.
[03:37:38.019 --> 03:37:38.599]  That's my honor.
[03:37:38.939 --> 03:37:46.223]  Okay, we've been giving you this other stuff for decades and telling you it was safe and effective, but now we've got to pull it all off in two weeks and burn it.
[03:37:46.443 --> 03:37:47.143]  Burn the evidence.
[03:37:47.703 --> 03:37:48.324]  Burn the evidence.
[03:37:48.824 --> 03:37:50.765]  Don't want anybody taking a look at that vaccine
[03:37:51.605 --> 03:37:55.350]  And saying, you know, why are they in such a hurry to pull this stuff off?
[03:37:55.450 --> 03:37:57.492]  What's in this that they don't want us to see?
[03:37:57.713 --> 03:37:58.454]  What's going on with it?
[03:37:59.255 --> 03:38:02.679]  Okay, so they say, well, in the long run, we think it's going to cause 90% fewer cases.
[03:38:02.979 --> 03:38:04.261]  But there's one big catch, they say.
[03:38:04.701 --> 03:38:10.168]  The new vaccine doesn't protect against one type of polio that was eradicated 15 years ago.
[03:38:11.752 --> 03:38:14.694]  That's why it's so important that all those vials of the old vaccine are completely destroyed.
[03:38:14.734 --> 03:38:19.536]  Some of the virus could leak into the world and we could have outbreaks of a type of polio we haven't seen since 1999.
[03:38:19.756 --> 03:38:23.058]  So I'm listening to this and I'm thinking, well, wait a minute.
[03:38:24.102 --> 03:38:34.228]  If they're saying that the vaccine has live polio in it, and it can mutate, and it can cause polio, or polio-like symptoms, that's what they used to tell us.
[03:38:34.288 --> 03:38:39.891]  When people would say, hey, look, your vaccines are giving people polio, the tens of thousands.
[03:38:39.951 --> 03:38:40.971]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:38:41.011 --> 03:38:41.792]  That's not polio.
[03:38:42.212 --> 03:38:44.213]  That's polio-like symptoms.
[03:38:44.253 --> 03:38:45.254]  That's not polio.
[03:38:46.718 --> 03:38:50.360]  Well, you know, we look at this and they say, well, we eradicated it 15 years ago.
[03:38:50.400 --> 03:38:53.662]  We've got to destroy all this stuff because we don't want anybody getting that.
[03:38:54.642 --> 03:39:08.050]  And I look at it and it's like, okay, you admit now that the vaccine was mutating and giving people polio, and you've got this strain that you said has been eradicated, and yet, wouldn't people be getting polio from that strain over the last 15 years?
[03:39:08.090 --> 03:39:09.411]  Was it truly eradicated?
[03:39:09.431 --> 03:39:13.573]  I mean, that reasoning there just doesn't make sense to me.
[03:39:14.795 --> 03:39:31.690]  If you have the possibility that the polio vaccine can mutate and give people polio, and one of the strains in it can do that, and we say we've got to get rid of it because we don't want that strain to be anywhere at all, then I would think that perhaps, maybe, that strain could also mutate, couldn't it?
[03:39:32.090 --> 03:39:34.272]  And that strain could also give people polio, couldn't it?
[03:39:34.673 --> 03:39:37.996]  And maybe that strain was the thing that they want to get rid of.
[03:39:39.360 --> 03:39:44.444]  But they don't want anybody to see it, they want to incinerate it, they want to bury it, and they're going to have inspectors coming around to make sure you do it.
[03:39:44.865 --> 03:39:47.967]  And then they finish up the report on NPR with this zinger.
[03:39:49.028 --> 03:39:51.390]  And Nandy says, it's all worth the risk.
[03:39:51.851 --> 03:39:58.997]  Because if the world is ever going to wipe out polio, we have to first make sure the vaccine isn't causing it.
[03:40:00.493 --> 03:40:00.753]  Yeah.
[03:40:01.253 --> 03:40:02.694]  That would be a good start, wouldn't it?
[03:40:03.254 --> 03:40:03.894]  That'd be a good start.
[03:40:03.914 --> 03:40:13.977]  You know, when you're looking at safety and efficacy of medical treatments, one of the things you want to make sure is, is that, you know, you're not making things worse with your vaccines or with your medical treatment.
[03:40:14.017 --> 03:40:16.178]  You want to know what the risks are.
[03:40:16.618 --> 03:40:22.299]  So I started going back and looking at this and saying, yeah, you know, it might actually have been causing it.
[03:40:22.319 --> 03:40:26.421]  So I find this story, found several stories, June, July of last year.
[03:40:27.141 --> 03:40:27.701]  Here's one of them.
[03:40:29.139 --> 03:40:36.784]  IBT, the International Business Times, new polio-like virus, C-105, is causing paralysis in children across the U.S.
[03:40:37.225 --> 03:40:38.846]  with 100 cases in 34 states.
[03:40:39.166 --> 03:40:43.449]  Oh, that kind of matches to what they just confessed to over here in this report.
[03:40:43.949 --> 03:40:50.734]  Now, what they're saying is a new strain of polio-like virus is believed to be behind the alarming cases of paralysis reported in children across the U.S.
[03:40:51.134 --> 03:40:56.038]  The virus is called the enterovirus C-105, belonging to the same polio family of viruses
[03:40:56.718 --> 03:40:58.419]  Could be causing the paralysis.
[03:40:58.499 --> 03:40:58.899]  Could be.
[03:40:59.820 --> 03:41:01.781]  Some other viruses are also on the suspect list.
[03:41:02.261 --> 03:41:15.389]  Known as acute flaccid myelitis, okay, like polio, leads to muscle weakness or paralysis of arms or legs and has been seen in 100 cases in 34 states.
[03:41:15.789 --> 03:41:19.831]  So they kind of were admitting it about a year ago and then they started this
[03:41:21.394 --> 03:41:33.037]  program to create a new polio vaccine and to make sure that when they're going to be able to roll it out, as soon as they can get it, they continue for a year to sell this because it's about the money, folks.
[03:41:34.498 --> 03:41:42.640]  So they continue to sell this vaccine for a year as they get stock built up of some new polio vaccines.
[03:41:43.400 --> 03:41:48.461]  And then they're going to make the switch in two weeks and get rid of the old stuff, get rid of the evidence.
[03:41:49.082 --> 03:41:50.122]  I find that very amazing.
[03:41:50.896 --> 03:42:12.081]  You know, when Dr. Wakefield was here, and we were looking at all these articles about whether or not they were going to censor his documentary at the Tribeca Film Festival, and as I said when I talked about it, I thought it was absolutely reprehensible that the people who were calling for the censorship, according to Robert De Niro and the person who was with the Tribeca
[03:42:13.210 --> 03:42:15.232]  Film Festival there on the Today Show.
[03:42:15.572 --> 03:42:19.556]  The people who are calling for the censorship, they said, for the most part, were filmmakers.
[03:42:20.136 --> 03:42:29.925]  Filmmakers said they were going to boycott the Tribeca Film Festival unless they censored the other filmmaker who had made facts, Dr. Wakefield.
[03:42:31.462 --> 03:42:35.863]  And I thought, you know, that is one of the saddest things, to see this kind of censorship.
[03:42:36.063 --> 03:42:37.104]  The censorship of the left.
[03:42:37.144 --> 03:42:38.764]  Of course, we see it in science as well.
[03:42:38.784 --> 03:42:39.284]  We got the U.S.
[03:42:39.324 --> 03:42:41.565]  Attorney General talking about, and it's building.
[03:42:41.665 --> 03:42:43.265]  This is something that's been going on for a while.
[03:42:43.625 --> 03:42:48.667]  They're still continuing to have meetings saying, we're going to prosecute people who are climate change deniers.
[03:42:48.687 --> 03:42:51.708]  We're going to come after them with the RICO statutes, okay?
[03:42:51.728 --> 03:42:58.469]  We're going to say they're racketeers, they're gangsters, they're corrupt organizations, because they don't believe the science.
[03:42:58.630 --> 03:43:00.070]  They have an honest disagreement with it.
[03:43:01.158 --> 03:43:05.660]  And it's what Billy Corrigan was saying earlier to Alex Jones.
[03:43:06.100 --> 03:43:08.221]  We can't have a discussion of stuff anymore, can we?
[03:43:08.802 --> 03:43:10.422]  We're going to criminalize dissent.
[03:43:10.562 --> 03:43:18.606]  You are going to agree with the official story, whether it is 9-11 or whether it is climate change or whether it is vaccines.
[03:43:18.666 --> 03:43:28.651]  If you want to question anything, if you are skeptical of anything, we are now going to censor you, perhaps criminally prosecute you with a RICO statute.
[03:43:29.687 --> 03:43:39.020]  We're not going to accept any open discussion, and I'm thinking, you know, when you're looking especially at science issues, things like climate change,
[03:43:39.904 --> 03:43:46.905]  As I mentioned before, they don't have any understanding whatsoever of the limits of tolerance when they look at this.
[03:43:46.925 --> 03:43:59.108]  We've had the founder of the Weather Channel saying, when we were looking at thermometers in the days when it was analog and a mercury thermometer and we were looking at that, you have to understand there are certain tolerances in your measurements.
[03:43:59.168 --> 03:44:07.630]  It's the first thing as an undergraduate science or engineering student you learn is that there are tolerances on what you measure in the lab.
[03:44:08.510 --> 03:44:12.791]  And they're taking these tolerances way, way beyond what is reasonable.
[03:44:12.811 --> 03:44:19.532]  And as I said before, I think a lot of it has to do with the fact you get a computer model and you got a printout and it's like, oh, God has spoken.
[03:44:19.592 --> 03:44:21.352]  Look, it's on the computers printed this out.
[03:44:21.812 --> 03:44:22.432]  So shut up.
[03:44:22.612 --> 03:44:23.453]  Everybody bow down.
[03:44:23.513 --> 03:44:26.813]  Or I've got a digital readout down to five decimal places.
[03:44:27.993 --> 03:44:29.494]  It's like, well, you know what?
[03:44:29.534 --> 03:44:37.115]  Maybe you're going to get a completely different reading if you stand over there on the tarmac in the sun than you are over here in the shade under the trees on your temperature.
[03:44:37.944 --> 03:44:43.647]  And so, there's a lot of different ways that their temperature measurements can be affected, but the whole world is going to melt down if it's one degree.
[03:44:43.687 --> 03:44:45.368]  We can't question their models.
[03:44:45.748 --> 03:44:51.952]  We can't verify their models, because their models are projecting effects out to many decades.
[03:44:51.992 --> 03:45:02.798]  What we have seen, some projections that they have made, and some of the things they've been doing this for long enough, that we were told by Al Gore that the polar ice caps would be gone by now, and they're not.
[03:45:03.658 --> 03:45:04.359]  By a long shot.
[03:45:04.919 --> 03:45:10.145]  So, we can look at some of their information, we can see that it's wrong, but what they want to do is they want to criminalize dissent.
[03:45:11.707 --> 03:45:13.549]  And we've got a lot of people who are speaking out.
[03:45:13.589 --> 03:45:22.439]  We only hear it when it's the actors like Robert De Niro who come out and say, my son has autism and I believe he got it as a direct result of a vaccine.
[03:45:23.260 --> 03:45:29.144]  Or we got another actor who came out, Aidan Quinn, who came out and said that he believes the same thing.
[03:45:29.385 --> 03:45:31.686]  He said, uh, autism doesn't run in my family.
[03:45:31.746 --> 03:45:34.949]  My oldest daughter had an extreme reaction to a vaccination.
[03:45:35.309 --> 03:45:37.531]  She was a normal child and got autism.
[03:45:37.711 --> 03:45:39.052]  I believe there's a connection here.
[03:45:39.192 --> 03:45:40.253]  I think it needs to be looked at.
[03:45:40.573 --> 03:45:44.116]  And to his credit, Robert De Niro has said, yes, you need to see this movie.
[03:45:45.131 --> 03:46:03.718]  But he also, in that interview, he says, well, I don't know about Dr. Wakefield, you know, he's a lot of people have questions about this scientist and when you look at Dr. Wakefield and the Daily Mail and others were reporting it, Daily Mail put his picture there and said, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, discredited, like it was his fourth name.
[03:46:04.653 --> 03:46:07.635]  What they don't tell you is about how he was vindicated.
[03:46:07.675 --> 03:46:12.237]  You know, where do you go to get your name back when somebody smears your name and lies about you?
[03:46:12.998 --> 03:46:14.239]  And then they have an investigation.
[03:46:14.999 --> 03:46:15.819]  And you are...
[03:46:17.651 --> 03:46:19.993]  ...found to be not guilty of their accusations.
[03:46:20.033 --> 03:46:21.554]  You were found to do the right thing.
[03:46:21.914 --> 03:46:23.235]  They don't publicize it, do they?
[03:46:23.295 --> 03:46:24.977]  The BBC did not publicize it.
[03:46:25.317 --> 03:46:46.553]  And going back to, here's, on three years ago, April 14th, 2013, with the UK's national media in a feeding frenzy, whipped up by the UK's Department of Health, claiming the current outbreaks of relatively few measles cases are all the fault of Dr. Wakefield, the BBC appears to have slipped up and have confirmed that the main plank of the General Media Medical Council's case against Dr. Wakefield and his two colleagues,
[03:46:47.441 --> 03:46:48.402]  Has bitten the dust.
[03:46:48.522 --> 03:46:52.565]  They said that he had only carried out one study and he shouldn't have drawn these conclusions.
[03:46:52.605 --> 03:46:56.208]  Well, they find out now that there were in fact two studies that were carried out.
[03:46:56.708 --> 03:46:58.950]  Okay, so why hasn't the BBC reported this?
[03:46:59.370 --> 03:47:00.912]  Why haven't they gone back and corrected it?
[03:47:02.393 --> 03:47:05.095]  They have not corrected that.
[03:47:05.535 --> 03:47:11.300]  So, this is worse than the situation where somebody screams out on page one accusing you of some crime
[03:47:12.441 --> 03:47:18.767]  And then a couple of days later, they print a retraction on the back of the newspaper, page 26 in small print.
[03:47:19.848 --> 03:47:23.851]  No, they're still screaming on page 1, even though he's been vindicated.
[03:47:24.312 --> 03:47:33.740]  And when I look at this, and I look at his dedication, and the fact that he has stood up and taken the hits to do it for children.
[03:47:34.581 --> 03:47:37.564]  To keep children like Robert De Niro's child.
[03:47:38.581 --> 03:47:45.843]  from other children, like Robert De Niro's child, from having this happen to them, or other children, like Aiden Quinn's daughter.
[03:47:46.883 --> 03:47:47.983]  These people have seen this.
[03:47:48.023 --> 03:47:49.484]  They have been devastated by this.
[03:47:50.224 --> 03:47:51.284]  And they're now speaking out.
[03:47:52.184 --> 03:47:54.685]  They're not going to be intimidated by the medical community.
[03:47:54.705 --> 03:47:59.986]  They're not going to be intimidated by the fact that people are going to call them wackos and loons.
[03:48:00.026 --> 03:48:00.946]  They know what they saw.
[03:48:01.607 --> 03:48:02.787]  And people are comparing notes.
[03:48:04.110 --> 03:48:15.577]  With each other, and you've got Dr. Wakefield, who did this investigation, who did the study, and then the BBC came in and made accusations against him, and then he was later vindicated, and they never did it.
[03:48:15.677 --> 03:48:19.800]  And I'm thinking, you know, that is the definition of a real hero.
[03:48:21.112 --> 03:48:35.777]  Somebody who will continue to do the right thing, who will not be intimidated, who will put his life, his reputation on the line to save the lives, to save the lives not only of these kids whose lives are destroyed, but it destroys the lives of their parents as well.
[03:48:36.737 --> 03:48:42.919]  And as Alex Jones has talked about, it is the perfect way to destroy an entire nation
[03:48:44.215 --> 03:48:50.718]  Because it's like having somebody who is severely wounded, you bring them back to take care of them, and you can't do anything yourself.
[03:48:51.258 --> 03:48:54.279]  You're basically constrained to that situation.
[03:48:55.360 --> 03:49:09.786]  Now, I want to, in the time that we've got left, tell you about our special that we've got, and also I've got an interesting observation, I think, about what happened with the trailing of this warship, the Donald Cook.
[03:49:10.586 --> 03:49:14.248]  Something that I find is interesting that the mainstream media is not talking about.
[03:49:14.288 --> 03:49:15.389]  A very interesting connection.
[03:49:15.449 --> 03:49:20.071]  Before I go to that, I just want to remind you that we have extended the sale for BrainForce.
[03:49:20.131 --> 03:49:24.334]  It is now 45% off the retail price.
[03:49:24.354 --> 03:49:27.175]  45% off the retail price.
[03:49:27.195 --> 03:49:28.896]  25% off of our previous sale price.
[03:49:29.397 --> 03:49:30.577]  It's the lowest it has ever been.
[03:49:30.777 --> 03:49:32.638]  Unprecedented sale on BrainForce.
[03:49:33.059 --> 03:49:35.320]  I think one of the best supplements we have here.
[03:49:36.040 --> 03:49:38.663]  You can find the reviews at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:49:39.063 --> 03:49:45.750]  There are hundreds of five-star reviews that you can read for yourself, see what people say it does for them, make your decision.
[03:49:45.770 --> 03:49:50.594]  This is a great time to try it when it is 45% off of the retail price.
[03:49:51.575 --> 03:49:54.077]  That's BrainForce at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:49:55.719 --> 03:49:58.381]  When I'm looking at all the reports about the back and forth,
[03:49:59.477 --> 03:50:05.021]  Whether the Russians are being aggressive towards us, whether they're trying to start World War III.
[03:50:05.642 --> 03:50:11.426]  And of course, some of us, I would say, that I'm concerned about the aggressiveness of our government.
[03:50:12.627 --> 03:50:14.688]  One of the things that I thought was interesting, you know, you look at
[03:50:15.836 --> 03:50:20.718]  Sherlock Holmes, one of his stories, he solved it because there was a dog that didn't bark.
[03:50:21.539 --> 03:50:38.527]  And while I'm listening to this story about the USS Donald Cook and how it was buzzed by this SU-24 Russian jet, I thought it was very interesting that nobody talked about the fact that this very same ship had exactly the same thing happen to it exactly two years ago.
[03:50:39.307 --> 03:50:43.389]  Wouldn't you think that that would be an interesting point to talk about if you're going to cover this?
[03:50:44.761 --> 03:50:45.302]  I think it is.
[03:50:45.322 --> 03:50:51.729]  And when we come back, I'm going to tell you what happened then, and why I think perhaps they didn't talk about it.
[03:50:51.970 --> 03:50:58.818]  And we're also going to talk about how John Kerry reacted, how the naval commander reacted, how China and Russia reacted.
[03:50:59.278 --> 03:51:03.463]  I think the scariest person in this entire equation is John Kerry.
[03:51:03.723 --> 03:51:04.905]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:51:11.056 --> 03:51:15.397]  Get Brain Force at 25% off for a limited time at Infowarslife.com.
[03:51:15.557 --> 03:51:17.738]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:51:17.858 --> 03:51:24.659]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[03:51:24.879 --> 03:51:28.160]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[03:51:28.180 --> 03:51:29.340]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[03:51:29.641 --> 03:51:31.481]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[03:51:31.821 --> 03:51:36.047]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[03:51:36.067 --> 03:51:37.109]  This is sustainable.
[03:51:37.229 --> 03:51:41.214]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[03:51:41.415 --> 03:51:44.599]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:51:44.659 --> 03:51:47.684]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:51:47.944 --> 03:51:54.926]  Looking at the television screen for research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:51:54.966 --> 03:52:00.128]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com.
[03:52:00.328 --> 03:52:02.149]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[03:52:02.269 --> 03:52:08.391]  Get BrainForce at 25% off for a limited time at Infowarslife.com.
[03:52:08.711 --> 03:52:10.112]  And we thank you for your support.
[03:52:10.632 --> 03:52:19.658]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:52:19.718 --> 03:52:27.824]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:52:28.124 --> 03:52:32.808]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:52:32.989 --> 03:52:39.695]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:52:39.795 --> 03:52:46.881]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:52:46.961 --> 03:52:48.703]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[03:52:48.863 --> 03:52:53.825]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:52:53.985 --> 03:52:58.326]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:52:58.466 --> 03:53:07.990]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:53:08.170 --> 03:53:10.351]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:53:10.571 --> 03:53:13.532]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[03:53:13.812 --> 03:53:16.093]  Introducing Deep Cleanse by InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:53:16.713 --> 03:53:23.418]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[03:53:23.698 --> 03:53:28.882]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[03:53:28.982 --> 03:53:37.849]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[03:53:38.109 --> 03:53:46.673]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[03:53:46.913 --> 03:53:53.837]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigyrex herbal processing technique.
[03:53:53.977 --> 03:54:00.060]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.
[03:54:00.300 --> 03:54:02.701]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:02.721 --> 03:54:03.262]  I'm David Knight.
[03:54:03.302 --> 03:54:05.663]  In this last segment, I want to talk about what's going on
[03:54:25.282 --> 03:54:32.485]  With the back and forth intimidation of Russian planes, American ships, and also American planes being intimidated by Russian fighter jets.
[03:54:33.465 --> 03:54:34.965]  Who is being provocative here?
[03:54:35.045 --> 03:54:35.966]  What is going on?
[03:54:36.006 --> 03:54:39.267]  And of course there is a, there's been a lot of reaction to this.
[03:54:39.947 --> 03:54:44.629]  One of the things that I thought was interesting in all of these reports, they went back and talked about how there had been
[03:54:45.663 --> 03:54:46.944]  Multiple cases of this.
[03:54:47.284 --> 03:54:52.047]  This began about April 15th, about a week or so ago.
[03:54:52.708 --> 03:55:11.560]  There was the USS Donald Cook and an encounter with a couple of Russian jets, but nobody talked about, even though they talked about a similar situation about a year ago with the same class of ship, nobody talked about the fact that it happened exactly two years ago to the exact same ship, the USS Donald Cook.
[03:55:12.588 --> 03:55:14.648]  Now, first I want to talk about the reactions.
[03:55:14.688 --> 03:55:19.449]  You've got John Kerry coming out saying, we could have opened fire on these jets.
[03:55:20.109 --> 03:55:22.070]  We could have started a war, essentially.
[03:55:22.630 --> 03:55:28.031]  He says it's unprofessional, and under the rules of engagement, John Kerry said, that plane could have been shot down.
[03:55:28.351 --> 03:55:32.412]  So people need to understand, this is serious business, and the United States is not going to be intimidated in the high seas.
[03:55:32.592 --> 03:55:34.212]  Okay, well, fine, okay.
[03:55:34.552 --> 03:55:39.653]  China crows about it, says Russia humiliated America with this, because you know,
[03:55:40.493 --> 03:55:50.479]  China is trying to intrude itself into the South China Sea into an area that they do not have any reasonable jurisdiction over.
[03:55:50.520 --> 03:55:59.585]  They're trying to take over those islands and so there is a back and forth intimidation going on between the Chinese and the American military there to say we're going to keep this in an international area and that's legitimate.
[03:55:59.625 --> 03:56:01.707]  But when I look at the situation with Russia,
[03:56:02.999 --> 03:56:08.724]  Uh, oh, first let me talk also about the response of the naval commander there, okay?
[03:56:09.185 --> 03:56:13.208]  And he said, this is why the Navy didn't shoot down Russian jets.
[03:56:13.349 --> 03:56:14.930]  And this is from the Navy Times.
[03:56:14.990 --> 03:56:22.256]  They say, Russian pilots rattled nerves across aboard the destroyer Donald Cook, buzzing within yards of the ship in the Baltic Sea.
[03:56:22.316 --> 03:56:24.578]  Provocative, sure, but they weren't a credible threat.
[03:56:25.427 --> 03:56:34.792]  It said, unarmed, SU-24 fighters flew within a thousand feet of the ship, once coming as close as 30 feet, in what US officials called simulated attacks.
[03:56:35.592 --> 03:56:39.934]  Well, the captain, Rick Hoffman, said, well, we're not at war with Russia.
[03:56:40.094 --> 03:56:47.158]  It'd be one thing to be operating and have a threatening attack profile from someone who we might not recognize, but that's not the case here.
[03:56:47.558 --> 03:56:56.041]  He says, if you've got visual identification of the jet, you can see it isn't carrying weapons, you don't detect any electronic emission, suggesting there's a missile lock on the ship, there's nothing to be done.
[03:56:56.681 --> 03:57:01.702]  You don't get to kill people because they're being annoying, said the captain of the ship.
[03:57:02.883 --> 03:57:03.383]  Thank you.
[03:57:03.783 --> 03:57:06.924]  We have somebody who is rational, okay?
[03:57:07.384 --> 03:57:08.785]  Not the political guys.
[03:57:08.805 --> 03:57:11.606]  And of course, the Russians are kind of blowing it off and saying, hey, there's nothing to this.
[03:57:12.066 --> 03:57:12.566]  No big deal.
[03:57:13.732 --> 03:57:15.394]  But you got the Chinese screaming about it.
[03:57:15.654 --> 03:57:19.038]  You got John Kerry saying, we could have shot him down and we'd been justified to do it.
[03:57:19.678 --> 03:57:26.666]  And fortunately, the guy who really is in charge of the ship is a lot more level-headed.
[03:57:26.746 --> 03:57:34.374]  Aren't you glad to know that we have some people in the military who aren't these histrionic, warmongering, you know...
[03:57:35.215 --> 03:57:37.717]  Bullying people like John Kerry, shooting their mouth off.
[03:57:38.058 --> 03:57:41.420]  Fortunately, they're not shooting their guns off in the Navy.
[03:57:42.321 --> 03:57:47.605]  They said it would be real interesting to see how this is played in the Russian papers, to see how they play this.
[03:57:47.685 --> 03:58:01.637]  Well, the interesting thing is, is that when it came out two years ago, the Russians were saying that they had flown for 90 minutes making multiple passes at the same ship, the USS Donald Cook.
[03:58:03.140 --> 03:58:05.843]  This most recent episode happened in the Baltic Sea.
[03:58:06.524 --> 03:58:12.711]  The previous incident happened in the Black Sea, which is about a quarter of the size of the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:58:13.432 --> 03:58:19.658]  Furthermore, they were off the coast of Romania at the time that it happens, which means that they were also off the coast of the Crimea.
[03:58:20.439 --> 03:58:27.022]  Which the Russians have had as part of Russia longer than the United States has been the United States.
[03:58:27.922 --> 03:58:42.168]  And what they claimed at that point, which nobody has talked about, and this may be why they're not going back to that two-year anniversary mark, they claim that for 90 minutes they were able to shut down the avionics on this state-of-the-art $1.6 billion destroyer.
[03:58:42.548 --> 03:58:46.530]  We'll talk about that more tonight on the Nightly News at 7 central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:46.550 --> 03:58:46.850]  Eastern.
