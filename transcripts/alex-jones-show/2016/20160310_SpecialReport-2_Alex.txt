[00:00:10.317 --> 00:00:18.685]  In an otherwise softball interview with Chris Matthews, Hillary Clinton seemed a little bit rattled when she was asked to explain the difference between a Democrat and a Socialist.
[00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:20.787]  What's the difference between a Socialist and a Democrat?
[00:00:22.103 --> 00:00:24.104]  Is that a question you want to answer or would you rather not?
[00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:27.565]  Well, you know, you'd have to ask... Well, see, I'm asking you.
[00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:29.606]  You're a Democrat, he's a Socialist.
[00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:31.447]  Would you like somebody to call you a Socialist?
[00:00:31.647 --> 00:00:32.927]  I wouldn't like somebody calling me a Socialist.
[00:00:32.947 --> 00:00:33.987]  But I'm not one.
[00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:36.348]  Okay, well what's the difference between a Socialist and a Democrat?
[00:00:36.448 --> 00:00:37.709]  Well, I can tell you what I am.
[00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.469]  I am a progressive Democrat.
[00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:48.853]  I'm a progressive Democrat who likes to get things done and who believes that we are better off in this country when we're trying to solve problems together.
[00:00:49.113 --> 00:00:51.636]  So this is the party's leading candidate.
[00:00:52.077 --> 00:00:59.366]  But Matthews was equally flustered last year when he asked the same question to the party's leading officer, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[00:00:59.806 --> 00:01:01.729]  What is the difference between a Democrat and a Socialist?
[00:01:04.332 --> 00:01:05.554]  I used to think there was a big difference.
[00:01:05.574 --> 00:01:06.194]  What do you think it is?
[00:01:08.624 --> 00:01:14.029]  What's the difference between being a Democrat and being a Republican?
[00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.912]  What's the big difference between a Democrat and a Socialist?
[00:01:17.073 --> 00:01:18.294]  You're the chairman of the Democratic Party.
[00:01:18.334 --> 00:01:19.856]  Tell me the difference between you and a Socialist.
[00:01:20.736 --> 00:01:26.182]  The relevant debate that we'll be having over the course of this campaign is, what's the difference between a Democrat and a Republican?
[00:01:27.023 --> 00:01:33.524]  So it's really difficult for them to explain the difference because there is no difference in the current contemporary Democratic Party.
[00:01:33.904 --> 00:01:41.486]  So since Bernie Sanders came on the scene introducing this term Democratic Socialism there into the mainstream, people are rightly confused.
[00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:42.866]  Here is the gist of it.
[00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:44.066]  This is socialism.
[00:01:44.286 --> 00:01:54.288]  So the three core demands of the National Day of Action are free public college, a cancellation of student debt, and a $15 an hour minimum wage for people who work on the campus.
[00:01:54.588 --> 00:01:55.648]  And how's that going to be paid?
[00:01:58.795 --> 00:01:59.355]  Great question.
[00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:08.057]  I mean, you know, so... Now, Margaret Thatcher famously said that the problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money.
[00:02:08.517 --> 00:02:14.718]  Now, socialists, they say, they're characterized by common ownership and democratic control of the means of production.
[00:02:15.018 --> 00:02:27.341]  And, of course, this means there has to be a big state there to divvy up all of these goodies to everyone equally, making sure that the very basic needs of society are being taken care of.
[00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:38.049]  Now, the Democrats, they also agree, you know, they want equality for all, rule by the majority, and they pretend to believe that nobody should be too rich, right?
[00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.931]  Unless you're Hillary Clinton or part of the ruling class.
[00:02:41.732 --> 00:02:46.336]  And they also believe in a big, and I do mean a very big government,
[00:02:46.696 --> 00:02:47.336]  Take care
[00:03:05.547 --> 00:03:05.988]  I think so.
[00:03:25.948 --> 00:03:28.009]  No, we are not a separate party.
[00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:36.651]  Like our friends and allies in the feminist, labor, civil rights, religious and community organizing movements, many of us have been active in the Democratic Party.
[00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:40.792]  We work with those movements to strengthen the party's left wing.
[00:03:41.032 --> 00:03:46.854]  We hope that at some point in the future, in coalition with our allies, an alternative national party will be viable.
[00:03:47.214 --> 00:03:54.976]  For now, we'll continue to support progressives who have a real chance at winning elections, which usually means left-wing Democrats.
[00:03:55.457 --> 00:03:56.800]  I am a progressive Democrat.
[00:03:57.261 --> 00:03:59.907]  So what's the difference between a Democrat and a socialist?
[00:04:00.228 --> 00:04:04.819]  Well, the answer is there isn't a real difference anymore, but no one wants to admit it.
