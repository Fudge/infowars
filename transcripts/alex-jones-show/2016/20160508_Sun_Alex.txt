[00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:20.638]  Well, here we are.
[00:00:21.338 --> 00:00:22.318]  It's Mother's Day.
[00:00:22.338 --> 00:00:22.318]  2016.
[00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:24.158]  May 8th.
[00:00:24.178 --> 00:00:29.840]  And I'm sitting back thinking about Mom.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.321]  And I'm sitting back thinking about my two daughters.
[00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:38.662]  And when I think about my mother and my daughters, it makes me think about...
[00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:41.548]  Well, my grandmothers.
[00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:47.372]  And it makes many of you think about your daughters and your mothers and your wife.
[00:00:48.213 --> 00:00:50.214]  It makes you think about the women in your life.
[00:00:50.234 --> 00:01:00.242]  And it makes me think about the number one threats to women on this planet today, instead of just offering up some platitudes about how much I love women.
[00:01:00.262 --> 00:01:03.204]  I just want to say I love humanity.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:12.706]  And we look at the multi-thousand percentage point increases in only Western countries of breast cancer since the 1940s.
[00:01:14.027 --> 00:01:15.288]  Almost 70 years ago.
[00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:23.773]  And it makes me realize that the people running this system really don't care
[00:01:24.913 --> 00:01:26.774]  about women in the final equation.
[00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:34.876]  All they care about is treating the mystery illnesses that are only expanding and only getting worse by the second.
[00:01:36.616 --> 00:01:44.318]  But secondarily, when I think about women and women's, quote, issues, which to me are just human issues, there is no separation between men and women.
[00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:45.579]  We're the same species.
[00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:46.399]  We are the species.
[00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:56.899]  It makes me think about a billion, five hundred million people worldwide that live under Islamic rule.
[00:02:00.191 --> 00:02:01.152]  We're good to go.
[00:02:21.917 --> 00:02:36.826]  And that's why when I see Saudi Arabia and our government and others working together to put radical Wahhabist Sunni Islamic teaching into place and to be taught in public schools and colleges around the United States and Europe as well.
[00:02:37.086 --> 00:02:44.090]  And I see anti-free speech laws being put into place in Europe to arrest people that raise the alarm about this orchestrated invasion.
[00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:46.078]  It makes my blood boil.
[00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:50.341]  When we come back from break, from this first segment, I'm going to tell you a story.
[00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:57.587]  Just a few nights ago, I took my daughters and some family out to eat at the local mall.
[00:02:57.688 --> 00:02:59.509]  Went to a restaurant there.
[00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.651]  The girls wanted some shoes.
[00:03:03.012 --> 00:03:09.958]  And the mall was literally, the word would be crawling, with slaves.
[00:03:11.508 --> 00:03:18.131]  The mall was filled everywhere I went with women wearing full coverings over their heads.
[00:03:18.211 --> 00:03:24.955]  I don't just mean hajibs or hajibs, I mean the full beekeeper suits.
[00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:31.678]  And understand something folks, if you go to Saudi Arabia and you try to preach the Christian gospel, you're executed.
[00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:33.539]  Bare minimum arrested.
[00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.680]  Tortured.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.881]  If you are a homosexual,
[00:03:37.802 --> 00:03:38.943]  You are executed.
[00:03:39.303 --> 00:03:40.824]  But nobody cares about that.
[00:03:40.904 --> 00:03:41.384]  No, no, no.
[00:03:41.744 --> 00:03:46.927]  It's the evil Alex Jones coming out and saying Europe's brought in five million.
[00:03:46.947 --> 00:03:48.988]  The United States has brought in a massive number.
[00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:49.769]  They keep it safe.
[00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:51.250]  I'm going to cover that in the next segment.
[00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.431]  And women are absolutely oppressed.
[00:03:54.552 --> 00:03:55.272]  And London just...
[00:03:57.453 --> 00:04:00.155]  Elected their first Muslim mayor, on and on and on.
[00:04:00.515 --> 00:04:04.358]  I've known a lot of great Muslim people, but they're what you call the heretics.
[00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:07.501]  The people that aren't following what's going on.
[00:04:07.821 --> 00:04:10.543]  Because Islam has had different periods in its history.
[00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:18.329]  But undoubtedly it is a political and sociological control grid with religion as a backdrop.
[00:04:19.562 --> 00:04:21.342]  And it's taken over much of the world.
[00:04:22.423 --> 00:04:27.684]  And it is absolutely, totally, and completely out of control.
[00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:38.827]  And it's time to have a real discussion about this because when I see a bunch of women wearing beekeeper suits, wearing masks over their faces, it's because those women are slaves.
[00:04:38.927 --> 00:04:42.408]  It'd be like if I went to the mall and suddenly saw slaves.
[00:04:43.268 --> 00:04:50.077]  From, you know, before the 1860s with chains around their necks, sitting there waiting for their master to come pick them up.
[00:04:50.437 --> 00:04:53.101]  I would be offended, I would be upset, I would be scared.
[00:04:54.302 --> 00:04:57.206]  And it made me fear for my daughters and the future of this country.
[00:04:57.266 --> 00:05:00.030]  We'll be back and we'll break it all down on Alex Jones.
[00:05:09.252 --> 00:05:20.236]  A staunch anti-federalist, Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution, fearing it would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it, but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty.
[00:05:20.316 --> 00:05:22.977]  His warnings, ignored, have now come to pass.
[00:05:23.317 --> 00:05:31.720]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased, nor how you are to become a great and powerful people, but how your liberties can be secured.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.541]  For liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:42.707]  Patrick Henry warned us, the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[00:05:42.927 --> 00:05:46.971]  Today, everything the government does, at every level, is concealed from us.
[00:05:47.271 --> 00:05:51.814]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see.
[00:05:52.195 --> 00:05:58.179]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different.
[00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:00.341]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:04.104]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort.
[00:06:04.264 --> 00:06:06.226]  When we should be demanding liberty.
[00:06:06.446 --> 00:06:08.507]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.491]  We are on the march.
[00:06:13.871 --> 00:06:16.273]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:06:17.034 --> 00:06:20.797]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:22.278 --> 00:06:23.138]  Well, here we are.
[00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:26.921]  Another Mother's Day has come.
[00:06:26.941 --> 00:06:28.983]  Soon another Mother's Day would have gone.
[00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:41.535]  We're all supposed to buy mom some chocolates or some flowers and take her out for a nice lunch and maybe rub her feet before she takes a hot bath and goes to bed at night.
[00:06:41.915 --> 00:06:42.416]  And you know what?
[00:06:42.456 --> 00:06:51.760]  I think all that's a great idea because mothers and the women in our lives period are one of the most precious things that go on on this planet as human beings.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.102]  And women, why they cherish their men as well and supposedly take good care of them.
[00:06:57.843 --> 00:06:58.603]  But I'll tell you something.
[00:07:00.031 --> 00:07:08.921]  We need to start thinking about the human community as a whole, and what the social engineers are doing, and what their agenda is for this planet.
[00:07:10.022 --> 00:07:17.351]  Instead of just focusing in on a little, innocent, and easy, sentimental things we do.
[00:07:19.477 --> 00:07:34.011]  Sure, it's important to give mom flowers, but isn't it more important, let's say, if mom is 70 years old and just doesn't seem to have her memory anymore and just doesn't seem to have energy anymore, isn't it important to actually research and find out that
[00:07:34.631 --> 00:07:41.394]  If she leads a sedentary lifestyle, that that absolutely leads to neuron degeneration in her brain.
[00:07:41.654 --> 00:07:49.357]  And if she would just walk around the block one time a day, why, mom might live 20 years longer and have a much better life.
[00:07:50.359 --> 00:07:52.260]  I've got the statistics and the articles right in front of me.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.421]  I'm going to go over some of them and give you the headlines in a moment.
[00:07:55.382 --> 00:08:00.024]  Oh, but that's nosy to get involved and try to warn mom.
[00:08:01.025 --> 00:08:07.288]  Oh, and maybe mom is 65 years old or 60 and suddenly she doesn't have the memory or the energy.
[00:08:07.768 --> 00:08:15.052]  Don't go look at the mainline studies about vitamin B12 and how gut flora is dead and how most people can't absorb it after age 50.
[00:08:15.932 --> 00:08:19.414]  And so that's one big reason we see so many neurological disorders.
[00:08:19.794 --> 00:08:20.676]  No, no, no.
[00:08:21.397 --> 00:08:25.502]  Don't educate mom, or dad for that matter, about vitamin B12.
[00:08:27.099 --> 00:08:39.104]  The average person who's just 30 years old or so in this country, you can look it up, has the vitamin B12 absorption level in their brain of a 75 to 80 year old person.
[00:08:39.544 --> 00:08:39.984]  Look it up.
[00:08:40.804 --> 00:08:41.745]  Oh, but just forget that.
[00:08:42.225 --> 00:08:43.685]  I'm being pessimistic.
[00:08:43.785 --> 00:08:45.346]  Give her a box of chocolates.
[00:08:45.806 --> 00:08:51.148]  That's much easier than actually being involved and trying to talk to mom about what's happening to her.
[00:08:51.248 --> 00:08:52.289]  But I'll tell you what's even easier.
[00:08:53.209 --> 00:08:56.290]  I'll tell you what's even more politically correct to do, okay?
[00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.050]  Because that's the way to go.
[00:08:59.811 --> 00:09:14.134]  Don't warn mom, or your daughters for that matter, about the fact that there's an orchestrated massive Islamic invasion with 5 million, quote, refugee invaders shipped in by the EU into Europe, or
[00:09:15.578 --> 00:09:18.519]  The Lord knows how many brought into this country because it's kept secret.
[00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:39.387]  Ignore the fact that in those Muslim nations women can't drive and women don't have any basic rights and women can be burned to death or drowned or have acid thrown on their faces or be stoned to death or have their throats slit or be hung because their husband feels like they were rude to him.
[00:09:39.627 --> 00:09:42.408]  Let's not hear anything from the feminists about that.
[00:09:42.628 --> 00:09:44.149]  Let's not hear any discussions about that.
[00:09:44.229 --> 00:09:44.829]  No, no, no, no.
[00:09:45.709 --> 00:09:47.671]  Yeah, that's my big issue here on Mother's Day.
[00:09:47.691 --> 00:09:56.178]  I, a few days ago, took my daughters and my son out to eat at a local mall.
[00:09:57.359 --> 00:10:04.445]  And, mind you, I've been in Europe and I've been in other major cities, but let me tell you, I've never seen anything like it.
[00:10:04.906 --> 00:10:09.330]  Everywhere I went at the Barton Creek Mall,
[00:10:10.598 --> 00:10:17.380]  was absolutely filled with women wearing full head covering with just a slit where their eyes were.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.201]  And you know what was so upsetting about that?
[00:10:19.721 --> 00:10:21.801]  I can't go to their countries and teach the gospel.
[00:10:22.282 --> 00:10:23.282]  I'd be arrested or killed.
[00:10:24.062 --> 00:10:24.502]  Literally.
[00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:25.562]  Saudi Arabia, you name it.
[00:10:26.223 --> 00:10:27.863]  If you're, quote, gay, you're killed.
[00:10:27.883 --> 00:10:28.984]  But that's okay for the left.
[00:10:29.024 --> 00:10:30.564]  They don't care.
[00:10:30.664 --> 00:10:36.526]  Let's bring this here in mass, and let's let these people call the shots, and let's change our culture to comply with theirs.
[00:10:37.786 --> 00:10:45.648]  Because that's how much the globalists hate the Renaissance and the West, where the real freedom for women and everybody else and the end of slavery basically came from.
[00:10:45.788 --> 00:10:51.949]  And that's why I'm so upset, because those poor women look completely scared and completely freaked out from their body language.
[00:10:51.969 --> 00:10:54.890]  And there were big groups of them all over the mall.
[00:10:55.690 --> 00:11:00.211]  Because you see, in their countries, they're hardly ever allowed to even go out, even though they're wearing hoods over their heads.
[00:11:01.454 --> 00:11:03.156]  I didn't see their men anywhere by the way.
[00:11:03.757 --> 00:11:06.940]  Their society is so incredibly completely segregated.
[00:11:07.781 --> 00:11:10.445]  But what was amazing was I realized that if I was
[00:11:11.894 --> 00:11:18.635]  At the mall, and I saw, let's say, a group of 20 black people with chains around their necks as slaves.
[00:11:19.396 --> 00:11:22.736]  I would be incredibly upset and say, slavery's been outlawed, what are you doing?
[00:11:22.956 --> 00:11:41.340]  But these were women, brought into this country, who will be beaten with an inch of their lives or killed, routinely are in the U.S., if they dare to try to take the hoods off their heads, if they dare to try to drive a car or get a job or live their life, or, God forbid, leave their supposed religion, because it's a giant cult.
[00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:55.218]  While the media attacks Christianity, and pulls crosses down, and attacks Christmas, and tells Christians they can't have Christmas cards, and finds little girls with Bibles in their backpacks at school, and takes them away, and suspends them, we've all seen the stories.
[00:11:55.938 --> 00:12:07.364]  As all this anti-Christian garbage goes on, with our tolerant, loving religion, we have to sit there and see the most radical islamicists the world has ever seen brought into this country in mass.
[00:12:08.539 --> 00:12:13.484]  And then, when they carry out terror attacks in our country, the citizens lose our rights.
[00:12:13.845 --> 00:12:14.886]  That's what's even sicker.
[00:12:16.668 --> 00:12:18.369]  And then there's somebody like Donald Trump.
[00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:26.678]  How dare Donald Trump say, hey, we're not vetting any of the refugees, they're not even checking their passports or IDs, which is admitted.
[00:12:27.119 --> 00:12:30.843]  Until we check them and find out what's happening, we've got to cut it all off.
[00:12:32.094 --> 00:12:33.756]  Oh my gosh, he's such a racist.
[00:12:34.296 --> 00:12:41.363]  But Saudi Arabia won't take one of these so-called refugees that are almost all invaders that went into Syria out of other Muslim countries.
[00:12:42.244 --> 00:12:46.748]  Oh, and Donald Trump's so evil, let me continue with all the bad things Donald Trump's done because he's so bad.
[00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:54.776]  Donald Trump said Mexico has the most stringent immigration in this hemisphere and forced labor for a year and tortures people that come in illegally.
[00:12:55.116 --> 00:13:01.663]  He just said we should vet people that have criminal past and ship them back because so many criminals are coming over to our country.
[00:13:02.103 --> 00:13:03.144]  Oh, he's so horrible.
[00:13:03.424 --> 00:13:05.006]  Mainstream television told me so.
[00:13:06.687 --> 00:13:08.109]  So that's the big question here today.
[00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.432]  Why does the establishment want to bring these people in?
[00:13:12.645 --> 00:13:13.505]  What's their endgame?
[00:13:14.265 --> 00:13:18.506]  And why does the mainstream media act like Donald Trump is a bad person when they know he's telling the truth?
[00:13:19.206 --> 00:13:39.071]  Because there's a globalist agenda to bring this country and Europe down because we're the birthplace of basic liberty and the renaissance and the human enlightenment and they want to get rid of real liberalism Thomas Jefferson 1776 style and radical Islamists that are taking over Islam are perfectly compatible
[00:13:39.811 --> 00:13:45.674]  And work like a horse in carriage with the radical left and the social justice warriors that want to shut down free speech.
[00:13:46.095 --> 00:13:50.057]  Coming up in the next hour, live in studio, Joe Biggs with Anthony Gucciardi.
[00:13:50.397 --> 00:14:04.465]  Joe Biggs, who was just out in Oregon, just yesterday, with the social justice warriors trying to attack Trump supporters at a rally, trying to block cars, attacking people, waving Mexican flags in mass and communist hammer and sickle flags in mass.
[00:14:05.851 --> 00:14:07.553]  The videos are up on InfoWars.com.
[00:14:21.072 --> 00:14:28.539]  Bitch and complain and say they want communism, or they want us to be Mexico, which is a collapse-filled state.
[00:14:28.799 --> 00:14:42.351]  These are a bunch of ignorant morons brainwashed by mainstream media and the colleges and the high schools that universally teach this crap, because the elites that have taken this country over are hell-bent on bringing this republic down.
[00:14:42.651 --> 00:15:01.583]  And so they take these couch potato people, whether they be white, black, hispanic, it doesn't matter, and they fill them full of the most mindless brainwashed garbage you can imagine, and then fill them full of all this anti-western, anti-white crud to bring down the megabanks last obstacle that is any
[00:15:01.803 --> 00:15:02.924]  We're good to go.
[00:15:18.483 --> 00:15:42.741]  The truth is America isn't perfect, and Western Europe isn't perfect, but it's the only place that ever got set up with any basic semblance of a free market system, and it created so much wealth that the American system threatened the hegemonic, crony, centralized systems of the robber barons, the royalty, and others, and so they've established their corporate world government to come in and destroy all that.
[00:15:43.061 --> 00:16:00.028]  And as soon as they've destroyed the engine of liberty and the engine of progress, and there's nothing to compete with them, they're gonna come in with their giant robot factories and leverage out all of their competition and make everyone sign on and sell out their humanity for the baubles these factories produce, and it's game over.
[00:16:00.368 --> 00:16:02.969]  Dictatorship 2.0 worldwide.
[00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:05.149]  We'll be back with the latest news and intel.
[00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:05.930]  Stay with us.
[00:16:13.959 --> 00:16:25.609]  I've been seeing all this opposition coming from Bernie and Hillary supporters and sitting there talking about, we're liberal, we're loving, we just want peace, yet they throw eggs at you and punch you in the mouth because they're peaceful and loving.
[00:16:25.889 --> 00:16:28.631]  I saw what went down in Southern California.
[00:16:29.171 --> 00:16:30.272]  It got to me.
[00:16:30.292 --> 00:16:33.415]  I had to come out here and actually talk about what's going on.
[00:16:33.435 --> 00:16:34.636]  These people don't want to talk to you.
[00:16:34.876 --> 00:16:35.597]  That's the problem.
[00:16:35.637 --> 00:16:39.260]  They sit there and say they don't have double standards and that they're not hypocritical.
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.962]  They'll come up to you and just yell and scream.
[00:16:42.282 --> 00:16:46.764]  Nazis, racists, can't get caught!
[00:16:46.804 --> 00:16:49.925]  Nazis, racists, can't get caught!
[00:17:00.149 --> 00:17:03.110]  All right, they said they were going to be arrested.
[00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.291]  Got people being triggered.
[00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:16.390]  This represents slavery!
[00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:17.650]  Colonialism!
[00:17:17.991 --> 00:17:18.871]  Genocide!
[00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:19.832]  Oppression!
[00:17:20.032 --> 00:17:23.554]  And it's alright to burn that s**t!
[00:17:23.614 --> 00:17:25.295]  Burn baby burn!
[00:17:25.415 --> 00:17:27.116]  Burn baby burn!
[00:17:27.676 --> 00:17:29.797]  Burn that colonialism!
[00:17:48.639 --> 00:17:51.125]  Alright, they're throwing eggs and they're pushing the protesters back.
[00:18:16.906 --> 00:18:17.266]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:17.326 --> 00:18:17.706]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:17.767 --> 00:18:18.747]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:18.767 --> 00:18:19.167]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:19.187 --> 00:18:20.048]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:20.548 --> 00:18:20.888]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:20.908 --> 00:18:21.309]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:21.329 --> 00:18:22.770]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:23.190]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:27.833]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:28.133 --> 00:18:28.513]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:28.533 --> 00:18:29.013]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:29.053 --> 00:18:29.654]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:29.674 --> 00:18:30.134]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:30.294 --> 00:18:30.714]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:30.734 --> 00:18:31.075]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:31.095 --> 00:18:31.495]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:31.515 --> 00:18:32.055]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:32.075 --> 00:18:32.455]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:32.475 --> 00:18:32.976]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:32.996 --> 00:18:33.416]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:33.456 --> 00:18:33.956]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:33.996 --> 00:18:34.417]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:34.437 --> 00:18:35.017]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:35.037 --> 00:18:35.497]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:35.557 --> 00:18:36.058]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:36.078 --> 00:18:36.718]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:36.738 --> 00:18:37.238]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:37.298 --> 00:18:37.679]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:37.819 --> 00:18:38.399]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:38.459 --> 00:18:39.119]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:39.660]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.240]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.021]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:41.381]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:41.401 --> 00:18:41.861]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:41.901 --> 00:18:42.421]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:42.442 --> 00:18:42.922]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:42.942 --> 00:18:43.302]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:43.322 --> 00:18:43.882]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:43.902 --> 00:18:44.363]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:44.403 --> 00:18:44.883]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:44.943 --> 00:18:45.343]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:45.363 --> 00:18:45.844]  You're a disgrace!
[00:18:45.864 --> 00:18:46.404]  You're a disgrace
[00:18:54.568 --> 00:18:56.134]  This is the heart of 1776!

[00:20:23.303 --> 00:20:27.466]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:20:28.206 --> 00:20:31.449]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:31.509 --> 00:20:33.510]  My stories are almost over.
[00:20:34.031 --> 00:20:38.194]  And then I'm going to turn the mic over to Anthony Gucciardi and Joe Biggs.
[00:20:39.054 --> 00:20:40.295]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20:40.415 --> 00:20:46.960]  Again, thank you so much for joining us on this live, original, worldwide broadcast.
[00:20:47.681 --> 00:20:48.522]  The 8th day of May, 2016.
[00:20:51.266 --> 00:20:52.527]  And I sound a little angry.
[00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:53.929]  I sound a little aggressive.
[00:20:54.209 --> 00:20:56.672]  And it's because I am angry.
[00:20:56.792 --> 00:20:57.492]  I am aggressive.
[00:20:58.173 --> 00:21:11.967]  I see our open, loving society being used by social engineers to bring down our cherished republic and replace it with a very nasty form of authoritarianism.
[00:21:13.609 --> 00:21:14.190]  And I see
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:26.888]  The United Nations and other organizations set up by the Rockefeller family in the last 70 years openly establishing a world government that's waging war against the nation-state.
[00:21:27.769 --> 00:21:39.637]  And I see these arrogant propagandists demonizing Donald Trump because he would dare be a nationalist and would defend sovereignty of our country and bring forward the idea
[00:21:40.538 --> 00:21:45.960]  That America first is what our country was founded on and what it should be based on.
[00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:57.646]  Yes, any nation is supposedly founded on the nation's sovereignty and interest being first, and that means the liberties and the freedoms of the citizens being first.
[00:21:58.646 --> 00:22:06.330]  That's why I've told Donald Trump on and off air, for America to be great again, she must be free again.
[00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:16.212]  But before I hand the baton to the rest of the crew for their live reports in studio, let's go over some of the supposed headlines.
[00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:30.535]  We're told by the mainstream media that things are getting nasty because Trump is coming out and exposing that Hillary, quote, is nasty and that she is mean and an enabler of Bill Clinton who settled rape cases.
[00:22:30.635 --> 00:22:31.795]  Well, thank God!
[00:22:32.575 --> 00:22:43.442]  That we see Trump trumping all of her claims that she represents women when she is a, by every yardstick, a vampiric political creature feeding on humanity.
[00:22:44.322 --> 00:22:47.945]  But when I look at the RNC, aren't they a bigger threat than even Hillary?
[00:22:48.425 --> 00:22:54.149]  The Rents, Previces, and the George Wills that told us our popular votes never counted and didn't matter?
[00:22:55.069 --> 00:22:55.790]  In the primaries.
[00:22:56.190 --> 00:23:01.353]  But the good news is that arrogant attempt to tell us that didn't work, it blew up in their faces.
[00:23:02.074 --> 00:23:09.419]  Showing them that the veneer of civilization and the population buying their fraud is peeling back very very quickly.
[00:23:09.799 --> 00:23:10.660]  These are the people
[00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:37.183]  that have presided over all these illegal wars, over the NSA spy, over the open borders, over all the jihadis being brought in, over all of the incredible government bureaucracy and corruption selectively enforced to shut down small companies and mom-and-pop operations, and then they have the nerve, the Bushes and the George Wills and the Republican establishment to point their fingers at Donald Trump and Donald Trump supporters
[00:23:37.743 --> 00:23:55.133]  And to gang up on the American people with the Communist Chinese government, and Mexican presidents, and the Pope, and the Saudi royalty, and all this other garbage in the British government, and criticize Donald Trump, and tell us who we can't have, and tell us what we must do.
[00:23:56.013 --> 00:24:08.272]  When they're the ones that have been presiding over the decline of our republic for decades and Donald Trump has never even had a chance at the helm to try to reverse any of this.
[00:24:09.622 --> 00:24:10.822]  What does that tell you about Trump?
[00:24:10.983 --> 00:24:12.003]  Why are they afraid of him?
[00:24:12.063 --> 00:24:13.864]  Because, again, he's a nationalist.
[00:24:14.444 --> 00:24:15.984]  He doesn't want to work within their system.
[00:24:16.685 --> 00:24:18.926]  He wants to have fair deals for this country.
[00:24:19.506 --> 00:24:28.569]  This nation's openness was used to be infiltrated by foreign governments and many others and major corporations to set up incredible scams.
[00:24:28.589 --> 00:24:37.553]  Listen, if you're a globalist and you can guarantee to shut down most of the power plants in the U.S., you've just ensured that the jobs go to Mexico, China, and India.
[00:24:38.593 --> 00:24:40.235]  And you find the very globalists doing it.
[00:24:40.656 --> 00:24:56.196]  So arrogant, the head of the UN program, Pacharia, years ago, who was shutting down coal plants in England, was opening them as they were shut down in India, using the plants shut down in England
[00:24:57.433 --> 00:25:05.421]  As the set-aside, quote, basically green space or easement to set him up in India with his inside deal for his family.
[00:25:06.082 --> 00:25:08.084]  This is how stupid they think we are.
[00:25:08.824 --> 00:25:19.074]  This is the type of garbage they have where the UK and Germany and France and Spain and Portugal and Greece can't have power plants that are totally clean, but Mexico and China can't.
[00:25:19.995 --> 00:25:23.017]  And it's not because we're trying to hurt the Mexican or Chinese people.
[00:25:23.057 --> 00:25:25.619]  We don't want them to have one-sided deals, though it's not fair.
[00:25:25.879 --> 00:25:31.483]  The globalists don't let them get any of the spoils, the booty, the goods from the jobs being shipped there.
[00:25:32.324 --> 00:25:37.367]  The jobs are being shipped there because they've got oligarchies and corrupt systems that totally control the people.
[00:25:38.328 --> 00:25:39.729]  And this is what we're talking about.
[00:25:39.769 --> 00:25:41.470]  This is what Trump is pointing out.
[00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:44.312]  Trump's not perfect, but listen to me, this is so important.
[00:25:45.089 --> 00:25:45.990]  Trump isn't perfect.
[00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:48.852]  But Trump doesn't hate America.
[00:25:49.412 --> 00:25:53.535]  Trump fundamentally has a sense, and so do I and so do you, of fairness.
[00:25:54.015 --> 00:25:56.357]  He's not out to get America.
[00:25:57.357 --> 00:25:59.699]  And that's why he is an anti-globalist.
[00:25:59.959 --> 00:26:00.920]  And that's why in his foreign
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:17.370]  Policy speech he said globalism is the problem and it's fundamentally unfair and it's about a bunch of special interests Shutting the country down and he's been told like other billionaires I know have been told the plan for post-industrialization and he is saying no
[00:26:18.712 --> 00:26:22.774]  How could we not stand with an American who's under all this foreign attack?
[00:26:23.114 --> 00:26:26.736]  How could we not stand with an American who's saying such things that are common sense?
[00:26:27.836 --> 00:26:32.258]  The majority of libertarians and patriots and conservatives and even a lot of liberals I know are backing Trump.
[00:26:32.298 --> 00:26:34.499]  His numbers are much higher than even the media says.
[00:26:35.019 --> 00:26:40.041]  But I am ashamed that close to 40% of the American people hate Trump and buy into mainstream media.
[00:26:40.362 --> 00:26:45.384]  And if you want to see who this collection of dupes and very sad idiots are,
[00:26:46.024 --> 00:26:52.268]  Go to InfoWars.com and see the video we put out last week of anti-Trump rallies in California attacking free speech.
[00:26:52.648 --> 00:26:54.349]  DrudgeReport.com, others linked to it.
[00:26:54.689 --> 00:26:57.091]  Just one version of the video has 4 million views.
[00:26:57.711 --> 00:26:59.452]  All total it's got about 14 million.
[00:26:59.993 --> 00:27:04.796]  It's anti-Trump rioters gone wild, uncensored.
[00:27:06.147 --> 00:27:13.791]  But there's a whole bunch of other videos just shot Friday and Saturday by Joe Biggs and our crew out in Oregon just as bad.
[00:27:14.411 --> 00:27:16.272]  Anti-free speech, anti-liberty.
[00:27:16.792 --> 00:27:26.577]  And you see these people in the lap of liberty, in the lap of all the services and things this country has to offer that rivals almost any nation on earth.
[00:27:26.717 --> 00:27:27.358]  We're not perfect.
[00:27:28.038 --> 00:27:32.441]  And they don't know how North Korea is, or how Russia was, or how Venezuela is.
[00:27:32.842 --> 00:27:34.263]  They don't have any sense.
[00:27:34.703 --> 00:27:36.244]  They don't have any idea.
[00:27:36.624 --> 00:27:41.888]  They don't have any imagination because they are so incredibly dumbed down.
[00:27:42.809 --> 00:27:47.592]  Obama came out and said, my election did not create post-racial society.
[00:27:47.633 --> 00:27:50.595]  No, he energized racial division, divide and conquer.
[00:27:51.778 --> 00:27:57.988]  And the AP had a quote of him saying, US in better place than when he graduated college.
[00:27:58.689 --> 00:28:01.513]  He also says we have the best economy we've ever had.
[00:28:02.884 --> 00:28:08.288]  Meanwhile, we have a video on Infowars.com of a Bernie supporter calls for the end of cash.
[00:28:08.328 --> 00:28:09.188]  That's the headline.
[00:28:09.308 --> 00:28:13.391]  Oregon Hippie says all private ownership and cash must end.
[00:28:14.172 --> 00:28:15.873]  But that's only in the U.S.
[00:28:16.033 --> 00:28:21.357]  When Obama a few months ago was down in Argentina, he said communism and capitalism can work together.
[00:28:22.057 --> 00:28:27.221]  You have communism locally, in your country, but multinationals are free market, that's right.
[00:28:27.561 --> 00:28:33.465]  You're a slave at a Foxcom Apple factory in China, with communist military controlling you as a slave.
[00:28:33.525 --> 00:28:36.868]  We just call it communism so it's trendy and all the liberals back in the U.S.
[00:28:36.908 --> 00:28:37.168]  love it.
[00:28:37.328 --> 00:28:41.211]  It must be great, you know, the communist Chinese execute gays, but that's okay.
[00:28:41.431 --> 00:28:43.232]  Who cares, it's trendy as long as Mao's for it.
[00:28:44.153 --> 00:28:52.256]  But then, internationally, the multinationals aren't communists, they're free market, tax-exempt, and they feed off the slave combine that is communism.
[00:28:52.776 --> 00:28:59.298]  We're gonna go to break, come back, I'm gonna talk about the neocons and the anti-free speechers attacking Trump.
[00:28:59.739 --> 00:29:05.521]  And one of them is Glenn Beck, and we'll talk about the big controversy that's brewing because I've been criticizing him as a Benedict Arnold.

[00:30:09.065 --> 00:30:17.932]  The Constitutional Convention of 1787 was held in strict secrecy, and at the end of the proceeding, citizens gathered outside Independence Hall to learn what had been produced behind closed doors.
[00:30:18.252 --> 00:30:22.335]  While Benjamin Franklin was leaving the hall, a lady asked him, Well, Doctor, what have we got?
[00:30:22.456 --> 00:30:23.937]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:30:24.057 --> 00:30:26.919]  To which he responded, A republic, if you can keep it.
[00:30:27.019 --> 00:30:31.603]  But today, not only have we lost a republic, but most people don't even know what a republic even is.
[00:30:31.783 --> 00:30:34.325]  For one thing, a republic is not a democracy.
[00:30:34.445 --> 00:30:40.327]  The republic operates under the rule of law, which protects individual liberties so that the majority cannot take away the rights of the minority.
[00:30:40.487 --> 00:30:45.829]  Under a republic, the government and its citizens all abide by the same laws regardless of political power or lack thereof.
[00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:50.170]  Democracy, on the other hand, only leads to mob rule fueled by the unrestrained whims of the public.
[00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:56.835]  In a democracy, the individual, or any groups of individuals composing the minority, have no protection against the unlimited power of the majority.
[00:30:57.075 --> 00:30:58.816]  It is a case of majority over man.
[00:30:58.977 --> 00:31:02.459]  In other words, under a democracy, two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner.
[00:31:02.479 --> 00:31:05.942]  But under a republic, the sheep's right to life is protected by the rule of law.
[00:31:06.022 --> 00:31:08.484]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com.
[00:31:08.924 --> 00:31:14.989]  It was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking so steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction to wit.
[00:31:15.109 --> 00:31:19.192]  By consolidation of power first, and then corruption its necessary consequence.
[00:31:19.352 --> 00:31:26.601]  Jefferson was warning us about the global elite, the 1% of the 1%, consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government.
[00:31:26.742 --> 00:31:28.564]  Unfortunately, we didn't heed his advice.
[00:31:28.724 --> 00:31:34.752]  We now live in a neo-feudalistic society in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment.
[00:31:34.952 --> 00:31:42.319]  Political office no longer represents the voice of the people, but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy.
[00:31:42.479 --> 00:31:50.047]  Simply put, we the people are responsible for civilization and culture, yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world.
[00:31:50.287 --> 00:31:58.413]  We falsely believe that everything is simply black and white, one extreme against the other, conservative versus liberal, but things will change once more of us realize this truth.
[00:31:58.573 --> 00:32:05.858]  As Thomas Jefferson also said, enlighten the people generally and tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.
[00:32:05.978 --> 00:32:08.340]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:17.827]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:32:17.887 --> 00:32:26.133]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:26.314 --> 00:32:31.017]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:32:31.197 --> 00:32:34.580]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:36.841]  We're good to go.
[00:33:00.037 --> 00:33:01.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:26.254 --> 00:33:27.855]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:28.196 --> 00:33:34.502]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:40.047 --> 00:33:47.013]  It is so real to turn on your computer on Friday afternoon and check the latest headlines.
[00:33:48.143 --> 00:33:55.527]  And to see the top headline on DrugsReport.com, Alex Jones, Glenn Beck on fire with evil.
[00:33:56.507 --> 00:33:58.848]  Sub-headline, a prancing demon.
[00:34:00.309 --> 00:34:07.612]  And that story was up there as one of the top stories until Saturday evening when the headline changed, Radio War.
[00:34:08.853 --> 00:34:14.956]  Alex Jones slams Glenn Beck as a psychopath who wants to be a cult leader.
[00:34:17.074 --> 00:34:18.295]  Look, I'll be honest with you.
[00:34:18.755 --> 00:34:26.480]  Glenn Beck has been a bully, doing things behind the scenes of myself, Ron Paul, and others for eight or nine years.
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.962]  And I've talked some about it, but I've tried to turn the other cheek.
[00:34:31.043 --> 00:34:44.491]  But when he started saying that millions of voters that were supporting Donald Trump were supporting a devil worshipper and this serpent, and that you were Christian if you were for Cruz, you were a devil if you were
[00:34:45.531 --> 00:35:00.863]  For Trump that type of cult-like behavior needs to be answered with aggressive truth And so I'm not retracting what I've said, but it's done in the spirit of standing up against a bully I don't want to spend my time bashing other talk show host
[00:35:02.424 --> 00:35:13.690]  Beck has done some good over the years with Agenda 21 and other issues like that, but so many other times, you know, he said, when you do something about Ron Paul, his supporters are terrorists that want to blow things up.
[00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:15.891]  They got something called a money bomb.
[00:35:15.971 --> 00:35:18.552]  This was years into Ron Paul's money bombs.
[00:35:18.833 --> 00:35:20.954]  You know, just so many things he's done like that.
[00:35:21.454 --> 00:35:22.775]  So much disinformation.
[00:35:23.975 --> 00:35:28.757]  That when he got so arrogant and was calling everybody devils, I basically came out and said, look, you're a devil, buddy.
[00:35:29.558 --> 00:35:32.079]  The way you behave, the way you operate, I'm tired of you.
[00:35:32.119 --> 00:35:42.103]  But I'll be honest, some of my anger was at Priebus and at George Will and the Republican establishment itself saying your local votes don't count.
[00:35:42.123 --> 00:35:49.286]  You know, we're the party, we're the sovereigns, your mere plurality doesn't count.
[00:35:49.566 --> 00:35:50.647]  I mean, they actually said that.
[00:35:51.107 --> 00:35:52.928]  And then I would see the clips online
[00:35:53.288 --> 00:36:06.358]  And on Drudge, of Glenn Beck saying, you're anointed Cruz, you've won the popular vote, there's a landslide, Donald Trump's a crybaby losing, Drudge's report, you know, is anti-Christian.
[00:36:06.919 --> 00:36:15.565]  I've never seen a website run so many stories pro-Christian, when Christians are being slaughtered and persecuted around the world, and crosses are being pulled down, and the war on Christmas.
[00:36:15.605 --> 00:36:20.329]  I mean, quite frankly, ten years ago, Drudge was reporting on the war on Christmas, and I wasn't aware of it.
[00:36:20.649 --> 00:36:23.910]  I was more of a libertarian then, and just kind of poo-pooed right-wing stuff.
[00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:27.331]  I learned about the war on Christmas from Drudge Report.
[00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:28.571]  Now I know it's real.
[00:36:28.871 --> 00:36:29.911]  Now it's out in the open.
[00:36:30.111 --> 00:36:32.072]  They're trying to basically ban it, okay?
[00:36:32.332 --> 00:36:33.432]  Everybody knows it's real now.
[00:36:33.452 --> 00:36:37.753]  And they're also trying to ban costume parties and everything else, and the words mother and father.
[00:36:38.173 --> 00:36:45.375]  But just to see that too, it's just, that's just one example of hundreds of inversions of reality that make me so angry.
[00:36:46.435 --> 00:36:46.735]  I don't
[00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:05.210]  We're
[00:37:25.795 --> 00:37:27.076]  Sit there and do all this stuff.
[00:37:27.676 --> 00:37:30.137]  The globalists did, and we're saying we don't like it.
[00:37:30.437 --> 00:37:37.480]  So I don't want to hear, we're the devil, and we're the problem, and we're the end of the world, and we're anti-Christian, and all this bull.
[00:37:37.901 --> 00:37:39.321]  So, that's why I punched back.
[00:37:39.641 --> 00:37:43.583]  You punch me, or you punch people I support, people I admire, I'm coming after you.
[00:37:43.783 --> 00:37:44.384]  That's how I work.
[00:37:45.444 --> 00:37:49.446]  But man, I don't take pleasure watching you just writhe around and implode, okay?
[00:37:51.704 --> 00:37:52.824]  So I'm done talking about it.
[00:37:53.665 --> 00:37:54.525]  It's out of control.
[00:37:55.205 --> 00:37:58.927]  And I'm sure tomorrow on the radio show we'll have to respond more because he's saying all sorts of garbage.
[00:37:58.967 --> 00:38:00.347]  Now, let's get into some positive news.
[00:38:00.367 --> 00:38:02.328]  I'm going to hand the baton to Anthony Gucciardi.
[00:38:03.008 --> 00:38:11.551]  You just type into search engine, vitamin B12, deficiencies, depression, Alzheimer's, mental illness.
[00:38:12.392 --> 00:38:13.212]  It's all over the place.
[00:38:13.232 --> 00:38:16.253]  And I'm going to cover some of those articles in a moment.
[00:38:17.731 --> 00:38:30.078]  You type in to any search engine, there's hundreds of articles and major studies admitting that a walk in the park, a walk in the woods every day, boosts your overall happiness, releases key chemicals in your brain, endorphins that are meant to make you happy.
[00:38:30.419 --> 00:38:30.999]  Absolutely.
[00:38:31.059 --> 00:38:33.220]  It's this artificial environment that's killing us.
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:39.024]  And so for all the negative things I cover, I want to let you know that's so we can recognize what's good from the bad.
[00:38:39.804 --> 00:38:48.491]  You've got to expose the bad, which the globals don't want to do, so that you can recognize it and basically curtail it, control it, reduce it.
[00:38:49.292 --> 00:38:53.975]  But you can go to The Atlantic and read, How Walking in Nature Prevents Depression.
[00:38:54.336 --> 00:38:59.159]  A study finds that wild environments boost well-being by reducing obsessive negative thoughts.
[00:38:59.259 --> 00:39:03.503]  So just go out and take a walk after the show, but think about positive ways to wake somebody up.
[00:39:03.723 --> 00:39:05.444]  We've got to be positive about telling the truth.
[00:39:06.665 --> 00:39:07.386]  Then take an action.
[00:39:07.406 --> 00:39:08.868]  And believe me, I'm preaching to myself here.
[00:39:08.888 --> 00:39:10.490]  I'm going to go take a walk after the show today.
[00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:12.312]  Here's another one out of Live Science.
[00:39:12.352 --> 00:39:13.453]  It's also in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:39:13.793 --> 00:39:17.137]  Low B12 seen in aging, autism, and schizophrenia.
[00:39:17.818 --> 00:39:18.038]  See?
[00:39:18.258 --> 00:39:18.498]  Boom.
[00:39:20.208 --> 00:39:20.288]  And
[00:39:40.022 --> 00:39:41.984]  Early onset of neurological disorders in people.
[00:39:42.424 --> 00:39:46.067]  So much of it, if you look at the studies, is because the gut's not absorbing the vitamin B12.
[00:39:46.628 --> 00:39:50.051]  You gotta get it through injections or sublingual under the tongue, okay?
[00:39:50.331 --> 00:39:52.753]  Just vitamin B12, folks, is a game changer.
[00:39:52.993 --> 00:39:56.056]  Just real organic vitamin C or folic acid, game changer.
[00:39:56.596 --> 00:39:58.497]  I don't even sell vitamin C or folic acid.
[00:39:58.737 --> 00:40:00.759]  The point is you just need sunlight.
[00:40:00.939 --> 00:40:12.086]  There's big studies about how sunlight makes you healthier and creates different chemicals in the body, not just vitamin D and things like that, where it actually creates nitrous oxide and weight loss.
[00:40:12.206 --> 00:40:13.867]  I mean, look, plants need it.
[00:40:13.907 --> 00:40:14.667]  We need it as well.
[00:40:14.727 --> 00:40:17.909]  We don't have photosynthesis, but we've got other metabolic things that are happening.
[00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:19.590]  So that's some of the positive news.
[00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:20.251]  And every day,
[00:40:20.811 --> 00:40:30.755]  I have little health alerts where I mention different positive things that are going on, positive things that are total game changers that people should be aware of and understand.
[00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:39.858]  But less screen time, more time outside, more time listening to radio boosts IQ because you have to image what you're hearing.
[00:40:40.218 --> 00:40:42.239]  Reading boosts overall cognitive ability.
[00:40:42.759 --> 00:40:44.160]  It is all this watching.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.181]  And this, you know, mindless garbage.
[00:40:46.221 --> 00:40:50.425]  Now, if you're actually watching something, but clicking on it, and doing things, it's not as negative.
[00:40:50.705 --> 00:40:56.350]  But still not as good as just reading, or actually, you know, going out to the lake, taking a swim, doing whatever.
[00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:58.111]  So, just be positive, folks.
[00:40:58.551 --> 00:41:00.653]  I'm not being negative, exposing all this corruption.
[00:41:00.933 --> 00:41:04.656]  It's very negative to ignore what's going on.
[00:41:04.997 --> 00:41:09.080]  I'm going to hand the baton to Anthony Gucciardi, Joe Biggs, and so much more today.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.642]  Infowars.com is the tip of the spear.
[00:41:11.942 --> 00:41:12.723]  God bless you all.
[00:41:13.752 --> 00:41:17.554]  There it is, Alex Jones with a message he just recorded before the show.
[00:41:17.874 --> 00:41:19.295]  And look, I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[00:41:19.355 --> 00:41:22.756]  I'm excited to always be invited on to host the show.
[00:41:22.936 --> 00:41:28.299]  And what Alex is talking about is the reality that we have all of the answers presented to us.
[00:41:28.639 --> 00:41:30.760]  We know the actual core issues.
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.380]  We know the solutions.
[00:41:32.801 --> 00:41:36.422]  We know what's actually going on, but we get pushed back.
[00:41:37.563 --> 00:41:39.704]  The system is designed.
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:58.666]  Call that what you will, whether it's the political establishment system, it's the politicians that are feeding into the establishment, to push back away from the core issues, from the core realities, and shift you into a state of mind where you're focused on the things that don't matter, so we don't talk about the core issues.
[00:41:59.605 --> 00:42:03.408]  But today, if you're receiving this transmission, I've got good news for you.
[00:42:04.209 --> 00:42:06.470]  I'm done with that, and I'm going to talk about the core issues.
[00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:14.296]  I'm going to talk about some of the big news, like the Canadian fire that threatens to double in size, 80,000 devastated residents.
[00:42:14.316 --> 00:42:22.783]  I'm going to talk about John Kerry says to prepare for a borderless world, and what he said about Trump, the opposition leader in Venezuela, assassinated.
[00:42:22.943 --> 00:42:28.067]  Hillary Clinton demonstrated gross negligence, according to a former FBI agent.
[00:42:28.727 --> 00:42:30.929]  And here's an interesting one that you're not going to hear about also.
[00:42:31.329 --> 00:42:39.815]  Court orders man to forfeit nearly $20,000 despite no criminal charges and prosecutors attempt to dismiss case.
[00:42:39.835 --> 00:42:41.215]  So that's just some of the news.
[00:42:41.255 --> 00:42:42.656]  We've got a lot, a lot of news.
[00:42:42.977 --> 00:42:49.241]  You're not going to see it certainly on the mainstream media and you're not even going to see it on some of the other big websites because I really scraped and found a lot of good stuff.
[00:42:49.661 --> 00:42:50.622]  So I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[00:42:50.662 --> 00:42:52.303]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:42:52.323 --> 00:42:52.883]  Stay right there.
[00:42:52.903 --> 00:42:58.507]  We're going to get to the core issues and Joe Biggs is going to come and join us and show us what he found at the anti-Trump rally.
[00:43:08.649 --> 00:43:09.669]  Brainforce is here.
[00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:12.470]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:20.552]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brainforce.
[00:43:21.351 --> 00:43:24.513]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:43:24.793 --> 00:43:24.913]  Right?
[00:43:24.933 --> 00:43:27.275]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:43:27.635 --> 00:43:31.157]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:43:31.197 --> 00:43:34.359]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:43:34.839 --> 00:43:39.842]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:43:40.162 --> 00:43:42.003]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:43:42.364 --> 00:43:46.806]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:43:46.946 --> 00:43:48.968]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:43:49.588 --> 00:43:51.049]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:43:51.189 --> 00:43:51.449]  Exactly.
[00:43:51.469 --> 00:43:55.233]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.

[00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:10.111]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:44:10.491 --> 00:44:16.415]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:44:16.635 --> 00:44:30.803]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running 6 miles every other day, swimming 2-3 miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights
[00:44:31.403 --> 00:44:33.304]  We're focusing on fighting the globalists.
[00:44:33.725 --> 00:44:41.530]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:44:41.751 --> 00:44:48.876]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:44:49.176 --> 00:44:54.900]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:45:01.205]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[00:45:01.445 --> 00:45:05.689]  Check them out today at Infowarslife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[00:45:05.929 --> 00:45:10.272]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[00:45:10.332 --> 00:45:12.354]  Today I want to talk to you about guns.
[00:45:12.654 --> 00:45:13.515]  Why we have them.
[00:45:13.715 --> 00:45:16.978]  Why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have them.
[00:45:17.078 --> 00:45:22.382]  And why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against it in the press.
[00:45:22.582 --> 00:45:29.508]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered more essential than the First Amendment.
[00:45:29.608 --> 00:45:40.059]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the redcoats.
[00:45:40.359 --> 00:45:43.783]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[00:45:45.885 --> 00:45:52.848]  The original amendments we referred to as the Bill of Rights contained ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[00:45:53.048 --> 00:45:55.589]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[00:45:55.709 --> 00:45:58.451]  It doesn't recognize color, or class, or wealth.
[00:45:58.551 --> 00:46:05.054]  It protects not just the rights of actors, or editors, or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[00:46:05.154 --> 00:46:07.655]  This is a small excerpt from Tralton Heston.
[00:46:09.474 --> 00:46:12.896]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:46:13.256 --> 00:46:20.380]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:29.344]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:46:29.624 --> 00:46:33.687]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:46:34.027 --> 00:46:36.208]  Pathenogens added to the food and water,
[00:46:36.408 --> 00:46:36.688]  We're good.
[00:46:58.524 --> 00:47:01.067]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[00:47:01.307 --> 00:47:04.250]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:07.373]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[00:47:12.839 --> 00:47:15.442]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.372 --> 00:47:27.873]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:47:28.413 --> 00:47:30.234]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:31.474 --> 00:47:35.255]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:35.475 --> 00:47:43.038]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi and we've got Joe Biggs coming up later in the show to come talk about what he saw at the anti-Trump rally up in Oregon.
[00:47:43.898 --> 00:47:52.887]  But first, you know, I was in an Uber last night, which may have been my last Uber ever in Austin, because Austin passed Proposition 1.
[00:47:53.327 --> 00:47:55.349]  Or it declined it, rather.
[00:47:56.511 --> 00:48:01.575]  And what happened is, Uber and Lyft have now said that they're going to leave Austin forever.
[00:48:02.543 --> 00:48:05.885]  At least until the act is repealed, the proposition is repealed.
[00:48:06.425 --> 00:48:11.327]  But the point is, I'm in an Uber, and the driver is talking about politics, okay?
[00:48:11.347 --> 00:48:15.129]  It's probably a first bad sign, but I decide to engage, right?
[00:48:15.149 --> 00:48:16.190]  We have a little chat.
[00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:19.151]  And we're talking about taxes.
[00:48:19.211 --> 00:48:31.637]  So he says, you know, I really like the fact that Bernie wants to tax the upper class and the millionaires and the billionaires and the corporations because, man, they don't pay their fair share.
[00:48:32.517 --> 00:48:32.657]  Right?
[00:48:33.197 --> 00:48:35.879]  And I said, OK, well, tell me more about that.
[00:48:35.899 --> 00:48:39.300]  And he goes, well, I like some of the stuff that Trump says, but he's a flat out racist.
[00:48:40.281 --> 00:48:41.081]  We'll get to that in a second.
[00:48:41.662 --> 00:48:44.883]  So on the tax thing, though, I said, well, what do you mean?
[00:48:44.923 --> 00:48:46.104]  You know, why do you like that?
[00:48:46.544 --> 00:48:50.246]  The so-called rich people that are making 200 plus thousand dollars a year are getting taxed more.
[00:48:50.266 --> 00:48:55.708]  He goes, well, they don't pay their fair share and I have to pay taxes and I don't like it.
[00:48:55.748 --> 00:48:58.390]  And my taxes are too high and I pay too much tax every year.
[00:48:59.290 --> 00:48:59.931]  And I said, man,
[00:49:00.953 --> 00:49:01.533]  You know what's funny?
[00:49:01.573 --> 00:49:06.636]  We talked about that for a little bit, and I said, you know, we talked about how basically 50% of Americans don't even pay taxes.
[00:49:06.656 --> 00:49:09.598]  I mean, you know how many people just don't even pay taxes?
[00:49:09.618 --> 00:49:11.039]  They make plenty of money, they don't even pay it.
[00:49:11.419 --> 00:49:17.943]  But besides all that, besides all that debate, I realized, man, we're debating something that is worthless.
[00:49:18.263 --> 00:49:19.684]  Because we already lost.
[00:49:19.764 --> 00:49:25.368]  If we're in that debate on who's going to pay the extra tax, the trillions in tax, we already lost.
[00:49:26.929 --> 00:49:32.070]  If you're listening right now and you're talking to somebody, you've talked to someone in the past about this debate, who's going to pay the tax?
[00:49:32.471 --> 00:49:33.871]  You already lost.
[00:49:34.311 --> 00:49:35.691]  We already lost the debate.
[00:49:36.132 --> 00:49:37.352]  We already lost hope.
[00:49:37.512 --> 00:49:37.912]  You know why?
[00:49:38.432 --> 00:49:41.393]  Because the core issue has been pushed back.
[00:49:41.773 --> 00:49:51.236]  The core issue isn't who's going to pay the extra tax, it's why are we paying the tax to the bloated system that is spending billions on junk.
[00:49:52.628 --> 00:49:53.648]  That is the core issue.
[00:49:54.189 --> 00:49:55.069]  And I want to talk about that.
[00:49:55.089 --> 00:49:56.749]  We've been pushed back from core issues.
[00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:57.570]  Deeply.
[00:49:57.830 --> 00:49:58.130]  Deeply.
[00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:03.632]  We've been pushed back from all of the root causes of everything.
[00:50:04.192 --> 00:50:06.333]  From the political system, to the health system, everything.
[00:50:07.013 --> 00:50:18.017]  You know, instead of addressing these problems, like, well, gee, instead of who will pay the tax, what about all the no mention of what the government's spending it on?
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:21.342]  I've got some lists here to give you a friendly reminder.
[00:50:22.203 --> 00:50:26.046]  Things like, you know, this is just a silly article.
[00:50:26.206 --> 00:50:28.808]  Seven of the wackiest examples of wasteful government spending.
[00:50:29.769 --> 00:50:31.010]  And this is a funny one.
[00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:37.435]  One of them is the National Institute of Health Center for Alternative and Complementary Medicine spent $387,000 to study the effects of Swedish massage on rabbits.
[00:50:41.658 --> 00:50:42.380]  It's useful stuff.
[00:50:43.702 --> 00:50:44.323]  This is a good one.
[00:50:45.105 --> 00:50:52.318]  The Natural Science Foundation granted more than $200,000 to a research project that is trying to determine how and why Wikipedia is sexist.
[00:50:53.831 --> 00:50:58.772]  Well, gee, that sounds like a good expenditure, and we can talk about how we're also pushed into political correctness every five seconds.
[00:50:59.912 --> 00:51:05.153]  National Institutes of Health also did a study to see if mothers love dogs as much as they love kids.
[00:51:06.393 --> 00:51:08.314]  They didn't even get their results, and it cost $371,000.
[00:51:08.594 --> 00:51:11.734]  You see where I'm going with this.
[00:51:11.995 --> 00:51:14.095]  $800,000 on an app for a food fight app.
[00:51:14.915 --> 00:51:18.856]  Some of the other stuff, $76 million to round up wild horses.
[00:51:20.534 --> 00:51:24.577]  7.8 million on interior conferences, Department of Interior.
[00:51:24.597 --> 00:51:26.919]  $10,000 DOJ pizza party, that makes sense.
[00:51:26.939 --> 00:51:29.520]  11 million private jets for DOJ political appointees.
[00:51:30.981 --> 00:51:33.583]  But who's gonna pay the extra taxes for all this?
[00:51:34.023 --> 00:51:35.524]  We gotta have the pizza parties.
[00:51:35.945 --> 00:51:38.767]  We gotta see what happens when those rabbits get their little massage.
[00:51:38.787 --> 00:51:42.629]  When they come in, after a long day, they need that sweetest massage.
[00:51:42.649 --> 00:51:43.570]  And who's gonna pay for it?
[00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:45.671]  The rich gotta pay for it.
[00:51:47.232 --> 00:51:48.193]  Wait, wait, wait a minute.
[00:51:49.309 --> 00:51:56.317]  You want the rich people to pay all their money to the Federal Reserve and you're mad at them because they're bad.
[00:51:56.358 --> 00:51:58.140]  They're not paying for the rabbit massages.
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.262]  They're not paying for the pizza parties.
[00:52:01.003 --> 00:52:02.765]  They're not paying for the fraudulent bank accounts.
[00:52:02.785 --> 00:52:05.649]  They're just giving money and all the IRS fraud and everything.
[00:52:06.129 --> 00:52:07.250]  How dare they?
[00:52:08.427 --> 00:52:10.548]  We lost, my friends, if we're on that debate.
[00:52:10.688 --> 00:52:11.528]  We lost.
[00:52:11.708 --> 00:52:17.710]  Meanwhile, 10 of the biggest companies pay no taxes because they're losing so much money on paper.
[00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:23.732]  Verizon Communications, $19.8 billion in profits, but their effective tax rate is negative 3.8%.
[00:52:23.772 --> 00:52:27.093]  And they gave money to pretty much everybody.
[00:52:28.053 --> 00:52:29.154]  Just a few more here.
[00:52:29.174 --> 00:52:30.594]  I mean, think about this, really.
[00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:32.975]  General Electric made $19.6 billion.
[00:52:33.015 --> 00:52:34.375]  Their tax rate is negative 18%.
[00:52:34.415 --> 00:52:35.876]  Because you know what?
[00:52:35.896 --> 00:52:36.816]  They lost a lot of money.
[00:52:38.081 --> 00:52:39.663]  On paper, they didn't make a dime.
[00:52:39.843 --> 00:52:42.345]  They lost so much money, they had to get refunds.
[00:52:43.967 --> 00:52:49.532]  Apache, Boeing, Boeing made $14 billion and their effective tax rate was negative 5.5%.
[00:52:50.113 --> 00:53:02.124]  So, another reason we're not allowed to talk about where the money goes, we're not allowed to talk about the Federal Reserve System, which is private, we're not allowed to talk about the gross misspending of billions, we're not allowed to talk about
[00:53:02.825 --> 00:53:03.145]  Anything.
[00:53:03.745 --> 00:53:05.826]  We're just allowed to debate what they let us.
[00:53:05.886 --> 00:53:14.029]  What the political establishment comes out and starts throwing at us, then we can debate on that, like little crumbs at the dinner table, instead of a big juicy steak, which is the core issue.
[00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:18.591]  And, you know, we're also forced to talk about political correctness.
[00:53:19.511 --> 00:53:23.733]  Because, notice also they spent 300k or whatever it was to see if Wikipedia was sexist.
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:25.760]  And that's fine.
[00:53:26.381 --> 00:53:31.944]  Because when you start talking about the real things we're talking about right now, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:53:32.305 --> 00:53:37.368]  You must only talk about the political correctness and the weird system that's in it.
[00:53:40.626 --> 00:53:47.229]  The politicians are going to go out and talk about, John Kerry says, to prepare for a borderless world during Trump jab.
[00:53:47.709 --> 00:53:54.912]  Secretary of State John Kerry told graduating students to prepare for a borderless world Friday during a commencement speech at Northeastern University.
[00:53:55.532 --> 00:54:00.314]  Kerry criticized the idea of using a wall to protect the country's porous southern border.
[00:54:00.794 --> 00:54:04.196]  As many of you were in elementary school when you learned the toughest lesson of all on 9-11.
[00:54:05.236 --> 00:54:07.260]  There are no walls big enough to stop people from anywhere.
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:12.429]  Tens of thousands of miles away who are determined to take on their own lives while they target others.
[00:54:12.629 --> 00:54:14.232]  He talked about a borderless world.
[00:54:14.452 --> 00:54:17.157]  So, you know, they're talking about...
[00:54:18.234 --> 00:54:27.138]  Serious foreign policy things that they want to integrate, and big changes they want to bring to the planet, and we're stuck on whether or not Wikipedia has a war on women.
[00:54:28.019 --> 00:54:28.579]  Don't think so.
[00:54:28.599 --> 00:54:30.600]  I think that's not good.
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:41.905]  So my goal here on this show, and if you're listening, you're part of the resistance, is to get back to the core problems, and to reset our focus, and to remind ourselves, hmm, you know, maybe we should talk about real news.
[00:54:41.925 --> 00:54:42.826]  How about this?
[00:54:44.448 --> 00:54:52.896]  Court orders man to forfeit nearly $20,000 despite no criminal charges and the prosecutor attempted to dismiss the case.
[00:54:53.137 --> 00:54:54.598]  The judge even said it was wrong.
[00:54:55.499 --> 00:54:57.201]  Even said this is baloney.
[00:54:57.942 --> 00:54:58.983]  But they still took it anyway.
[00:54:59.563 --> 00:55:00.044]  That happens.
[00:55:01.374 --> 00:55:14.819]  An Arkansas court of appeals on Wednesday upheld civil forfeiture of almost $20,000 taken from a man during a traffic stop, even though he was never charged with a crime and prosecutors had previously attempted to dismiss the case.
[00:55:16.001 --> 00:55:23.087]  Back in July 2013, his name is Guillermo Espinosa, was traveling with his girlfriend to Texas when they were pulled over by the Arkansas State Police.
[00:55:23.587 --> 00:55:32.835]  During the stop, a drug dog alerted to the computer bag, and inside police found $19,894 in cash, which they promptly seized.
[00:55:33.615 --> 00:55:36.177]  No contraband was found during the stop.
[00:55:37.598 --> 00:55:39.960]  Excuse me, sir, the dog barked at absolutely nothing.
[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:41.602]  I'm going to have to open that bag.
[00:55:41.942 --> 00:55:45.205]  I guess they were traveling, moving or something, and they brought some cash.
[00:55:46.308 --> 00:55:48.591]  And the cops take the money, steal it.
[00:55:48.691 --> 00:55:52.956]  They took the money with no contraband in sight and nothing.
[00:55:54.798 --> 00:55:55.739]  That is how it works now.
[00:55:56.838 --> 00:55:59.740]  And, amazingly, it's in here how much they took.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:13.147]  Yes, it says, an Institute for Justice report found that between 2000 and 2014, Arkansas law enforcement agencies seized more than $80 million in cash and 9,500 vehicles.
[00:56:14.068 --> 00:56:17.369]  That is enough to make me not want to even drive through Arkansas.
[00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:19.771]  $80 million in cash?
[00:56:20.751 --> 00:56:20.991]  What?
[00:56:21.592 --> 00:56:22.472]  For doing nothing?
[00:56:22.632 --> 00:56:23.273]  And they appealed it.
[00:56:24.042 --> 00:56:25.383]  And they said, no, sorry.
[00:56:25.943 --> 00:56:29.984]  He was past the appeal time after the initial judge said, no, you have no case.
[00:56:30.925 --> 00:56:31.845]  So that's what happens now.
[00:56:31.945 --> 00:56:33.226]  You don't even have drugs in your car.
[00:56:33.426 --> 00:56:34.286]  You just get stopped.
[00:56:34.386 --> 00:56:38.668]  And if the dog barks because it has to go to the bathroom, you just have to seize all your cash.
[00:56:39.838 --> 00:56:40.618]  That's what happens, I guess.
[00:56:40.859 --> 00:56:43.820]  But on the good side of things, it's not going to be all about how everything's horrible.
[00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:45.161]  There's a lot of good news, too.
[00:56:45.821 --> 00:56:49.544]  And the truth is, though, highlighting this stuff is the positive response.
[00:56:49.844 --> 00:57:01.991]  Highlighting what's going on empowers you to make better decisions and not get caught up in the stupid debate on who's going to pay the taxes, when billions are being flushed down the toilet, or the political correctness stuff, when real things are going on.
[00:57:02.776 --> 00:57:12.741]  So I'll tell you what, we're about to head to a break here, but we're going to talk about scientists discover the first ever safe way to send medication to placenta and it could avoid and end premature births.
[00:57:13.422 --> 00:57:18.525]  Some pretty interesting news and a lot more about Hillary Clinton, gross negligence in handling classified information.
[00:57:18.965 --> 00:57:22.827]  Joe Baggs is going to come talk about what he saw at the anti-Trump rally in Oregon.
[00:57:22.847 --> 00:57:26.109]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi, this is the Alex Jones Show Power Pact.
[00:57:26.429 --> 00:57:27.850]  Stay tuned, a lot more coming.
[00:57:28.170 --> 00:57:29.691]  We'll be right back after this break.
[00:57:58.996 --> 00:58:09.979]  A staunch anti-federalist, Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution, fearing it would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it, but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty.
[00:58:10.079 --> 00:58:12.719]  His warnings, ignored, have now come to pass.
[00:58:13.059 --> 00:58:21.461]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased, nor how you are to become a great and powerful people, but how your liberties can be secured.
[00:58:21.621 --> 00:58:24.282]  For liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[00:58:24.542 --> 00:58:32.448]  Patrick Henry warned us, the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[00:58:32.688 --> 00:58:36.712]  Today, everything the government does, at every level, is concealed from us.
[00:58:37.012 --> 00:58:41.575]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see.
[00:58:41.936 --> 00:58:47.940]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.102]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[00:58:50.362 --> 00:58:53.865]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort.
[00:58:54.025 --> 00:58:55.966]  When we should be demanding liberty.
[00:58:56.226 --> 00:58:58.208]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:59:23.985 --> 00:59:24.586]  We're good to go.
[00:59:40.362 --> 00:59:46.806]  In a democracy, the individual or any groups of individuals composing the minority have no protection against the unlimited power of the majority.
[00:59:47.046 --> 00:59:48.787]  It is a case of majority over man.
[00:59:48.947 --> 00:59:52.449]  In other words, under democracy, two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner.
[00:59:52.469 --> 00:59:55.912]  But under a republic, the sheep's right to life is protected by the rule of law.
[00:59:55.992 --> 00:59:58.493]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com.
[01:00:02.816 --> 01:00:05.457]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:12.228 --> 01:00:18.242]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:18.864 --> 01:00:21.851]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.075 --> 01:00:29.516]  That's right, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:29.796 --> 01:00:30.756]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[01:00:31.036 --> 01:00:34.597]  Very happy and honored to be invited to guest host the show.
[01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:45.501]  I'll tell you what, there is a lot of news that we're going to get to, and Joe Biggs is going to come on in the coming segment to talk about the anti-Trump rally and what he saw in Oregon.
[01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:47.022]  We've got some videos for you as well.
[01:00:47.882 --> 01:00:54.309]  I'll tell you what, I was talking a little bit earlier about how I was in this Uber yesterday, and the driver was talking politics.
[01:00:54.789 --> 01:01:03.858]  And he was just, you know, I like to listen to what people really think that, you know, don't heavily research the information, but just kind of what they hear from friends or whatever.
[01:01:04.218 --> 01:01:09.484]  And he goes, yeah, I do like a lot of the stuff Trump says, but obviously he's a racist.
[01:01:10.939 --> 01:01:13.940]  And I said, I said, look, I'm open to all possibilities.
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:18.081]  If you have information that proves he is a racist, give it to me.
[01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:19.321]  I'm not OK.
[01:01:19.541 --> 01:01:19.961]  Show it to me.
[01:01:19.981 --> 01:01:21.021]  You know, I'd like to see it.
[01:01:21.521 --> 01:01:24.682]  I said, what specifically has he said that's racist?
[01:01:25.222 --> 01:01:28.683]  And again, I'm not even proclaiming to be a major Trump supporter or anything.
[01:01:28.703 --> 01:01:30.563]  I'm just saying, what information do you have?
[01:01:31.183 --> 01:01:33.524]  And he goes, well, everyone knows it's clear.
[01:01:34.465 --> 01:01:34.926]  That's okay.
[01:01:35.346 --> 01:01:37.589]  But what line, like what did he do?
[01:01:37.649 --> 01:01:41.313]  What news article, what was it that showed he was such a racist, horrible person?
[01:01:41.353 --> 01:01:44.396]  He goes, well, he wants to keep illegal immigrants out.
[01:01:45.778 --> 01:01:48.060]  And I said, well, how is that racist?
[01:01:49.682 --> 01:01:51.464]  It's an illegal immigration issue.
[01:01:51.705 --> 01:01:55.429]  And he goes, well, he's racist because they're Mexican.
[01:01:58.578 --> 01:02:03.060]  So now it's racist to not want illegal immigration.
[01:02:03.801 --> 01:02:06.082]  And I said, do you see how absurd that sounds?
[01:02:06.102 --> 01:02:11.125]  And he goes, no, those Mexican people are hard workers and they deserve to be here.
[01:02:12.165 --> 01:02:14.667]  So I guess it's actually a racist now.
[01:02:15.687 --> 01:02:17.388]  It's funny because I'm not even trying to defend Trump.
[01:02:17.709 --> 01:02:19.410]  But I guess by that logic, it's racist.
[01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:22.952]  If I go down the street, let's say I go home and someone's breaking into my house.
[01:02:23.775 --> 01:02:24.035]  Okay.
[01:02:24.675 --> 01:02:29.817]  And they're like destroying my door, like running in, taking, looting all my stuff and putting it in a pickup truck.
[01:02:30.697 --> 01:02:34.698]  And I guess I should just not call the police because of that illegal activity or it would be racist.
[01:02:35.578 --> 01:02:39.639]  To stop an illegal immigrant coming into the country is racist.
[01:02:40.079 --> 01:02:43.600]  Therefore, we cannot stop any illegal activities or we could be labeled a racist.
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.101]  I guess it makes perfect sense.
[01:02:46.461 --> 01:02:51.462]  And I bring that up because, as Biggs is going to come on and talk about, when you talk to people on the street,
[01:02:52.483 --> 01:02:56.129]  They say Donald Trump is racist and they just spit fire and they hate him or whatever.
[01:02:57.351 --> 01:03:00.356]  They often can't talk about specific things.
[01:03:00.757 --> 01:03:04.083]  They just say, well everyone knows that he's a horrible person, he's a racist, he's a bad person.
[01:03:05.285 --> 01:03:09.166]  And it's funny, because I actually like a lot of things about Bernie Sanders.
[01:03:09.246 --> 01:03:12.067]  I think, in many ways, you know, he's against the NSA spying.
[01:03:12.427 --> 01:03:14.867]  He's really so-called anti-establishment in many ways.
[01:03:15.647 --> 01:03:25.890]  And they think that I'm some, like, huge hater, like, mega-Trump fan or something, and I come up and just ask them, why is he racist, and they scream at me, like, I'm evil, like, how dare you!
[01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:26.910]  You know he's racist!
[01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:31.293]  And it just goes to show how far we have fallen from the details.
[01:03:32.114 --> 01:03:37.001]  And, you know, another thing is how we've been sold an unattainable lie.
[01:03:38.302 --> 01:03:40.343]  That's another thing I want to talk about on the show today.
[01:03:40.363 --> 01:03:57.471]  And, uh, you know, I was meeting with Alex earlier, we did a Facebook mentions, and he had the magazines from the grocery store checkout, like the tabloid magazines, and it had all these celebrities and the royalty and, you know, Prince Harry and his Kate or whatever, and how amazing they are.
[01:03:58.451 --> 01:04:14.500]  And the whole lie that we've been fed where it's so unattainable it shows the fitness models and magazines that I know people like this they don't eat for like a week beforehand and they they work out for two hours and jog and cut all their salt or whatever and they just look like
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:21.544]  You know, amazing for a week, and then afterwards they come back and they actually eat real food and they're all bloated and like gross and vomiting.
[01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:31.611]  But when you see them in the fitness model shoot, and when the Photoshop is hit, you know, and the lights are perfect in a million-dollar studio, and it's like, you should look like this!
[01:04:32.172 --> 01:04:33.473]  You should be this person!
[01:04:34.193 --> 01:04:36.315]  You know, we're sold an unattainable lie.
[01:04:36.735 --> 01:04:42.159]  And if you flip a few pages next, it's an ad for weight loss, or it's an ad for an antidepressant.
[01:04:43.234 --> 01:04:53.905]  Our society has been so locked out of the core issues and the details that we just spew that everyone's racist and, unfortunately, by the tabloid magazines.
[01:04:53.925 --> 01:04:54.766]  We're going to talk about that.
[01:04:54.786 --> 01:05:01.513]  We're going to talk about some big news, actually, about Hillary Clinton having found gross negligence in handling her classified information.
[01:05:01.533 --> 01:05:02.214]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:02.314 --> 01:05:05.257]  This is Anthony Gucciardi on the Alex Jones Show, Sunday edition.
[01:05:05.337 --> 01:05:05.698]  Stay tuned.
[01:05:11.067 --> 01:05:14.469]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:05:14.830 --> 01:05:21.954]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:05:22.575 --> 01:05:30.920]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:05:31.201 --> 01:05:35.283]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:05:35.603 --> 01:05:40.947]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:45.010]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:48.532]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:05:48.852 --> 01:05:59.920]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:02.662]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[01:06:02.902 --> 01:06:08.866]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:25.205]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:25.746 --> 01:06:27.148]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:31.971 --> 01:06:32.611]  All right, we're back.
[01:06:33.171 --> 01:06:33.972]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:06:34.012 --> 01:06:36.853]  This is the Alex Jones Show and I've got good news for you.
[01:06:36.873 --> 01:06:37.813]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[01:06:37.833 --> 01:06:40.674]  We're going to hit some actual real news and real issues.
[01:06:41.254 --> 01:06:44.675]  None of the BS political correctness that you may be used to hearing.
[01:06:45.655 --> 01:06:51.377]  None of the micro news, the micro information that you also may be used to hearing.
[01:06:51.397 --> 01:06:52.518]  We're going to hit some real stuff.
[01:06:52.538 --> 01:06:55.899]  We're going to talk about real talk and just generally
[01:06:56.499 --> 01:07:03.294]  Kind of get the pulse of what's actually going on in a way that is not full of propaganda and establishment political system.
[01:07:04.102 --> 01:07:06.783]  First of all, we're going to talk about maybe a little bit of good news.
[01:07:07.203 --> 01:07:11.605]  Scientists discover the first ever safe way to send medication into the placenta.
[01:07:12.005 --> 01:07:17.467]  For the first time in history, scientists have found a way to safely send drugs into the placenta during pregnancy.
[01:07:17.847 --> 01:07:22.369]  This finding holds the possibility of one day being able to avoid premature births.
[01:07:22.389 --> 01:07:23.429]  I can't read today.
[01:07:23.729 --> 01:07:27.091]  And treat common complications that often occur during early pregnancy.
[01:07:27.631 --> 01:07:29.812]  So, that is good news.
[01:07:30.672 --> 01:07:31.313]  On the developments.
[01:07:31.413 --> 01:07:34.855]  Also, there's the massive fire going on in Canada.
[01:07:35.215 --> 01:07:41.120]  Monster Canadian Fire threatens to double in size while more than 80,000 devastated residents are forced to evacuate.
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:46.944]  80,000 people have left Fort McMurray, Alberta, where the fire has torched 1,600 homes and buildings.
[01:07:47.344 --> 01:07:48.585]  It's covering 249,571 acres.
[01:07:48.605 --> 01:07:49.185]  They say it might double.
[01:07:54.502 --> 01:07:55.663]  Very, very sad.
[01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:59.769]  Some of the residents are staying behind, according to AFP.
[01:08:00.830 --> 01:08:09.060]  Police were still working Saturday to evacuate residents left behind in the Canadian city, the epicenter of the country's ferocious wildfire, nearly a week into the disaster.
[01:08:09.901 --> 01:08:14.862]  But, also there are some reports that it is actually being under control.
[01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:19.363]  According to Reuters, Canada officials are starting to get a handle on Largest Wildfire.
[01:08:19.863 --> 01:08:21.824]  So, hopefully they will actually get a handle on it.
[01:08:21.864 --> 01:08:24.945]  Because if it doubles, that would be extremely dramatic.
[01:08:25.505 --> 01:08:25.825]  Horrible.
[01:08:26.005 --> 01:08:26.365]  Tragic.
[01:08:27.005 --> 01:08:28.386]  So, here's some more news.
[01:08:29.066 --> 01:08:37.828]  Hillary Clinton, and this is just a representation to me, of how far we've come in many wrong directions.
[01:08:39.141 --> 01:08:42.743]  We have, and should be the nominee most likely, right?
[01:08:43.664 --> 01:08:51.928]  For the Democratic Party, the former FBI agent and many others are saying that basically she's a criminal.
[01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:56.211]  Regardless if you love her, it's an objective fact.
[01:08:56.831 --> 01:09:03.355]  So Hillary Clinton demonstrated, quote, gross negligence in handling classified information, former FBI agent.
[01:09:04.115 --> 01:09:04.996]  It's from Reuters.
[01:09:06.215 --> 01:09:06.956]  Actually, it's from RT.
[01:09:06.976 --> 01:09:07.957]  Sorry, this is photos from Reuters.
[01:09:08.397 --> 01:09:14.802]  Clinton faces questioning over handling of classified information emails as well as funds received by the Clinton Foundation while she was in high office.
[01:09:15.143 --> 01:09:19.246]  James Conway, former FBI agent and managing director of Global Intel Strategies told RT.
[01:09:21.464 --> 01:09:29.870]  CBS News reported the Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton will be interviewed by the FBI in the near future regarding the messages sent and received on her private email server.
[01:09:30.491 --> 01:09:36.335]  So the former FBI agent says, I do know the protocols and standards the FBI follows when it comes to serious violations of law.
[01:09:36.755 --> 01:09:41.519]  First of all, the FBI is a political organization that has nothing to do with politics.
[01:09:42.119 --> 01:09:49.944]  Agents of the FBI and support employees of the FBI take an oath to uphold the law, and that's regardless of who may have committed violations of the law.
[01:09:51.028 --> 01:09:52.888]  So in other words, he's saying, hey.
[01:09:54.261 --> 01:09:56.182]  I'm not saying that I'm anti-Hillary Clinton.
[01:09:56.902 --> 01:10:02.684]  It's just an objective reality that she's being investigated and they might actually have to do something about it.
[01:10:03.004 --> 01:10:05.204]  Decision time for FBI on Clinton.
[01:10:05.585 --> 01:10:05.985]  The Hill.
[01:10:06.405 --> 01:10:11.706]  FBI investigations swirling around Hillary Clinton's presidential run appears to have entered its final stages.
[01:10:12.247 --> 01:10:22.510]  Many of the former Secretary of State's top aides have been interviewed over the course of the last month, and Clinton herself is expected to answer investigators' questions about her use of a private email server in the coming days or weeks.
[01:10:23.530 --> 01:10:29.993]  Quote, this certainly sends the signal that they are nearing an end to their investigation, said Stephen Levin, former federal prosecutor.
[01:10:30.413 --> 01:10:31.534]  Think about the madness, man.
[01:10:32.574 --> 01:10:44.299]  We're living in a country where a potential president could be indicted, you know, could be in prison, is objectively being investigated as to whether or not she is a criminal.
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.741]  That is kind of how far we've gone down the rabbit hole.
[01:10:49.542 --> 01:10:49.842]  Truly.
[01:10:50.822 --> 01:10:51.983]  You know, meanwhile,
[01:10:53.183 --> 01:10:54.504]  I wanted to tie in with this.
[01:10:54.784 --> 01:10:59.928]  CDC, this is a bit older of an article, but the teen suicide attempts were on the rise.
[01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:05.133]  That the Thursday revealed that the number of attempted suicides among teenagers had increased from 6.3% to 7.8% from 2009-2011.
[01:11:05.153 --> 01:11:05.793]  Again, a bit older article.
[01:11:11.778 --> 01:11:17.286]  But it reminded me, we got into this a little bit, of the meeting I had with Alex earlier.
[01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:20.850]  I was talking to Alex, we were doing a Facebook mentions talking about the show today.
[01:11:21.391 --> 01:11:24.015]  And he had bought all these tabloids from the grocery store.
[01:11:24.515 --> 01:11:29.021]  You know, the ridiculous ones like, Brad Pitt cheats on Angelina Jolie!
[01:11:30.632 --> 01:11:31.953]  Horrible marriage problems.
[01:11:31.993 --> 01:11:33.895]  You know, she weighs 90 pounds, that kind of stuff.
[01:11:33.935 --> 01:11:35.456]  And then they had the royalty on there.
[01:11:35.976 --> 01:11:37.277]  I'm sure we could show it on the mentions.
[01:11:38.078 --> 01:11:39.479]  And it's about a third way in.
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:44.663]  And then had, you know, Angelina Jolie and the royalty, Prince Harry, how Kate stays fit.
[01:11:44.783 --> 01:11:46.345]  Oh, Princess Kate, all that kind of stuff.
[01:11:46.565 --> 01:11:47.345]  Just general...
[01:11:48.564 --> 01:11:49.545]  Making them icons.
[01:11:50.345 --> 01:12:00.772]  And they feature models and actors with perfect bodies, which is really just they starve themselves for a week or two and don't have any water so that they're all ripped and stuff.
[01:12:01.252 --> 01:12:05.755]  And they get into the magazine shoot with the perfect lighting and their fake tans and the Photoshop
[01:12:06.817 --> 01:12:09.139]  You may have seen the before and after Photoshop of all these people.
[01:12:09.859 --> 01:12:12.201]  And we just are supposed to think they're icons.
[01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:17.025]  And if you flip through these magazines, they tell you, you don't look like this person.
[01:12:17.045 --> 01:12:18.826]  You know, you should, this is what's in right now.
[01:12:18.866 --> 01:12:21.288]  Look at all this overpriced stuff this person's wearing.
[01:12:21.909 --> 01:12:23.450]  Look at Kim Kardashian's butt.
[01:12:24.271 --> 01:12:28.394]  And I've always said we should care more about the future of this planet than Kim Kardashian's butt.
[01:12:28.674 --> 01:12:29.795]  But you're sold a lie.
[01:12:30.455 --> 01:12:31.997]  You're sold unattainable goals.
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:38.487]  If you're watching right now on InfoWars.com forward slash show, you can see the magazines that we're talking about.
[01:12:39.147 --> 01:12:47.317]  It's a sick system because they'll show these models, they'll show these celebrities how cool they are, look at their mega mansions, look how great they are.
[01:12:48.311 --> 01:12:54.836]  And it's funny because the next page you'll flip and there's a weight loss ad.
[01:12:55.016 --> 01:12:57.718]  And it says, you know, do you not look your best?
[01:12:58.619 --> 01:13:02.762]  Try this, you know, lose 20 pounds in four days or whatever craziness.
[01:13:03.022 --> 01:13:03.903]  And then you keep flipping.
[01:13:04.403 --> 01:13:05.825]  It's an antidepressant ad.
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:09.341]  It's an ad for antidepressants in the magazine.
[01:13:09.901 --> 01:13:11.622]  Because they know it's so sad!
[01:13:11.962 --> 01:13:13.222]  The people reading these!
[01:13:13.342 --> 01:13:14.923]  And nothing even against you if you read it.
[01:13:15.123 --> 01:13:15.823]  I feel sorry.
[01:13:16.123 --> 01:13:31.689]  I don't like these magazines because they make you think if you don't look like that and you don't have that house and you're not that amazing celebrity then you're nothing and you're worthless and you're scum and you better get the weight loss pills and get the antidepressant drugs because you need to be like them.
[01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:34.690]  But it's a sick system.
[01:13:35.689 --> 01:13:40.193]  And today's Mother's Day, I want to acknowledge that, and I have an idea.
[01:13:41.814 --> 01:13:48.360]  And my belief is instead of making the celebrities the icons, and we have a love-hate relationship with celebrities in America, don't we?
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:52.843]  We hate them, and we hate them, and we love them, and we like to read all their little gossip and stuff.
[01:13:53.264 --> 01:14:02.552]  How about instead of worshipping celebrities like Kim Kardashian, we actually focus on giving credit to people like single mothers?
[01:14:03.666 --> 01:14:12.632]  People that raise their children from nothing, that are poor and broke and sacrifice themselves, which is the essence of humanity, to actually raising their kids.
[01:14:13.332 --> 01:14:15.033]  Or sacrifice themselves in some other way.
[01:14:15.053 --> 01:14:18.175]  How about the grandmother that lifts the truck off the little girl that's dying?
[01:14:19.236 --> 01:14:21.638]  I think they should be on the front of magazines like that.
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:38.906]  Of course it wouldn't sell as much, but I think that the single mothers, the grandmothers that lift trucks off kids, the men and women that actually sacrifice themselves and are good people and really aren't famous for anything, that is who we should be making icons in our society.
[01:14:39.627 --> 01:14:45.709]  It shouldn't be 90 pound celebrities who had a cheating fling with their marriage or whatever.
[01:14:46.309 --> 01:14:48.810]  You know, that's the essence of humanity, is to actually build people up.
[01:14:49.410 --> 01:14:53.392]  Not talk about how they're trash if they're not looking like these people.
[01:14:53.732 --> 01:14:57.993]  Just unattainable junk, and then sell them weight loss pills and antidepressants.
[01:14:58.613 --> 01:14:59.854]  You know, that doesn't work for me.
[01:15:00.174 --> 01:15:02.595]  I'm not into that system, and I don't buy into it.
[01:15:03.035 --> 01:15:13.439]  And that's why teen suicide rates are going up, because the teens think they're not cool, they're not attractive and trendy or whatever, because they're not looking like the people in these magazines.
[01:15:14.377 --> 01:15:15.399]  That's all I have to say about that.
[01:15:15.941 --> 01:15:16.863]  Now let's cover some more news.
[01:15:16.883 --> 01:15:21.814]  Let's talk about Leader Opposition Party in Venezuela assassinated.
[01:15:22.827 --> 01:15:29.273]  Venezuelan politician German Mavare, leader of the opposition UNT party, died Friday after being shot in the head.
[01:15:29.293 --> 01:15:34.277]  An assassination that occurred in the western state of Lara, his organization said.
[01:15:34.857 --> 01:15:40.762]  The board of UNT expresses its deepest sorrow for the slaying of colleague German Mavare.
[01:15:40.802 --> 01:15:43.145]  We demand justice and an end to violence.
[01:15:43.925 --> 01:15:47.768]  So a little bit more craziness from around the world as we continue to see.
[01:15:48.749 --> 01:15:50.090]  It is a sad state of affairs.
[01:15:50.811 --> 01:15:51.051]  Isn't it?
[01:15:51.851 --> 01:15:56.073]  We have someone running for president who very might well be or is a criminal.
[01:15:56.873 --> 01:15:58.834]  We have people being assassinated.
[01:15:59.234 --> 01:16:05.276]  But at the end of the day, we are basically fighting the very system that says everything is just okay.
[01:16:05.396 --> 01:16:05.856]  Go to sleep.
[01:16:05.876 --> 01:16:06.476]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:06.596 --> 01:16:07.637]  Alex Jones Show with Joe Biggs.
[01:16:08.388 --> 01:16:18.673]  It was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking such steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction to wit, by consolidation of power first and then corruption its necessary consequence.
[01:16:18.833 --> 01:16:26.076]  Jefferson was warning us about the global elite, the 1% of the 1%, consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government.
[01:16:26.216 --> 01:16:28.037]  Unfortunately, we didn't heed his advice.
[01:16:28.197 --> 01:16:34.240]  We now live in a neo-feudalistic society in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment.
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:41.809]  Political office no longer represents the voice of the people, but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy.
[01:16:41.949 --> 01:16:49.538]  Simply put, we the people are responsible for civilization and culture, yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world.
[01:16:49.758 --> 01:16:57.900]  We falsely believe that everything is simply black and white, one extreme against the other, conservative versus liberal, but things will change once more of us realize this truth.
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:05.322]  As Thomas Jefferson also said, enlighten the people generally and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.
[01:17:05.342 --> 01:17:07.823]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com
[01:17:08.303 --> 01:17:19.293]  A staunch anti-federalist, Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution, fearing it would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it, but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty.
[01:17:19.373 --> 01:17:22.035]  His warnings, ignored, have now come to pass.
[01:17:22.376 --> 01:17:30.763]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased, nor how you are to become a great and powerful people, but how your liberties can be secured.
[01:17:30.943 --> 01:17:33.606]  For liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[01:17:33.846 --> 01:17:41.754]  Patrick Henry warned us, the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[01:17:41.974 --> 01:17:46.018]  Today, everything the government does, at every level, is concealed from us.
[01:17:46.318 --> 01:17:50.883]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see.
[01:17:51.243 --> 01:17:57.229]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different.
[01:17:57.469 --> 01:17:59.450]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[01:17:59.650 --> 01:18:05.252]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort, when we should be demanding liberty.
[01:18:05.512 --> 01:18:07.532]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:18:08.232 --> 01:18:17.255]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:18:17.335 --> 01:18:25.418]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:18:25.718 --> 01:18:30.420]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:18:44.565 --> 01:18:51.427]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[01:19:08.213 --> 01:19:09.734]  My name is Alex Jones.
[01:19:10.114 --> 01:19:16.056]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:19:16.276 --> 01:19:17.377]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[01:19:18.837 --> 01:19:32.946]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[01:19:33.366 --> 01:19:37.449]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[01:19:41.371 --> 01:19:48.513]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[01:19:48.793 --> 01:19:54.514]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[01:19:54.635 --> 01:20:00.896]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[01:20:01.076 --> 01:20:04.817]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[01:20:12.378 --> 01:20:14.966]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:22.967 --> 01:20:32.991]  They're intentionally leaving the borders open in Europe, bringing in mass refugees, among them are going to be jihadists, who are setting up a future Tet Offensive, Tet-style offensive, in Europe.
[01:20:33.191 --> 01:20:34.732]  And the same thing's being done to this country.
[01:20:35.192 --> 01:20:45.616]  On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor, half-frozen snake.
[01:20:47.324 --> 01:20:51.767]  His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew.
[01:20:52.267 --> 01:20:53.348]  Oh well, she cried.
[01:20:53.829 --> 01:20:54.609]  I'll take you in.
[01:20:55.049 --> 01:20:56.170]  And I'll take care of you.
[01:20:57.311 --> 01:20:58.772]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:20:59.332 --> 01:21:00.793]  Take me in for heaven's sake.
[01:21:01.254 --> 01:21:02.815]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:21:03.875 --> 01:21:06.497]  Sighed the vicious snake.
[01:21:08.499 --> 01:21:10.580]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:12.461]  Take me in for heaven's sake.
[01:21:13.322 --> 01:21:14.803]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:21:15.845 --> 01:21:18.607]  Beside the vicious snake.
[01:21:19.847 --> 01:21:22.329]  Now she clutched him to her bosom.
[01:21:22.809 --> 01:21:24.650]  You're so beautiful, she cried.
[01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:29.733]  But if I hadn't brought you in by now, you might have died.
[01:21:30.839 --> 01:21:36.121]  She stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight.
[01:21:36.942 --> 01:21:44.145]  But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite.
[01:21:45.025 --> 01:21:46.626]  I saved you, cried the woman.
[01:21:47.674 --> 01:21:50.356]  And you've bit me, heavens why?
[01:21:51.296 --> 01:21:55.819]  You know your bite is poisonous, and now I'm going to die.
[01:21:56.799 --> 01:22:00.902]  Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin.
[01:22:01.742 --> 01:22:07.006]  You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.
[01:22:10.588 --> 01:22:15.631]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:22:16.783 --> 01:22:21.948]  That's right, it is the Alex Jones Show and I'm Anthony Gucciardi and I'm joined right now by Joe Biggs.
[01:22:22.649 --> 01:22:28.194]  The reason he's going to come in and talk is, number one, he's got back from an Oregon anti-Trump rally.
[01:22:29.075 --> 01:22:39.726]  And to me, the biggest thing about all these anti-Trump rallies is the ridiculousness and the lack of details and the lack of actual discussion.
[01:22:40.146 --> 01:22:49.589]  It just turns into destroying cop cars, screaming slurs at people, screaming curse words, saying you're a bad person, you're a racist, you're a horrible human being.
[01:22:50.050 --> 01:22:52.551]  And I've talked to a lot of people that are rabidly anti-Trump.
[01:22:52.951 --> 01:22:59.293]  And again, not even proclaiming myself to be a Trump supporter, or, you know, I never even told them I liked him at all, right?
[01:22:59.373 --> 01:23:02.394]  So for all they know, or for all everyone knows, I could completely dislike him.
[01:23:02.714 --> 01:23:04.135]  But I would say, how is he racist?
[01:23:04.475 --> 01:23:07.136]  And they just say, I don't know, it's just, shut up, F you, racist.
[01:23:07.981 --> 01:23:09.742]  You know, Biggs, tell us about what you saw up there.
[01:23:09.962 --> 01:23:12.023]  And I guess we're going to play some video over it as well.
[01:23:12.043 --> 01:23:15.124]  Yeah, so we went out to Eugene, Oregon, Friday.
[01:23:15.144 --> 01:23:19.886]  Flew out that morning, got there probably around 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
[01:23:20.226 --> 01:23:22.407]  There were already thousands of people waiting.
[01:23:22.887 --> 01:23:28.209]  There was guys that got there 6.30 in the morning to go see Donald Trump speak at this rally.
[01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.769]  And
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:54.682]  Barricaded themselves into this area to where, when you walked into this event, into this gated area, you had to go through them.
[01:23:54.962 --> 01:24:01.025]  You had to go through the slurs, being cussed at, screamed at, called a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, the spitting, the yelling.
[01:24:01.505 --> 01:24:07.607]  Children, you know, were being hugged by their mothers as they were going through these crowds of people just yelling and flipping out.
[01:24:09.682 --> 01:24:10.402]  It's really surreal.
[01:24:10.422 --> 01:24:23.448]  I mean, it's crazy to see that because they're sitting here calling for this world where there's peace and love and there's no hate, but there's some of the most vile, hateful people you will ever encounter in your life.
[01:24:23.508 --> 01:24:25.849]  It's completely and totally ridiculous to see that.
[01:24:26.169 --> 01:24:32.432]  To see one say, you know, love Trump's all, or they have all these different signs that go against completely the way that they're acting.
[01:24:32.932 --> 01:24:39.956]  You know, there's one guy that says, I'm here today to ask these pro-Trump guys, you know, these people, why they're voting for him.
[01:24:40.296 --> 01:24:45.339]  And I want to, you know, get involved in the conversation and find out why they would vote for him.
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:48.121]  And I said, so you're going to be willing to be calm?
[01:24:48.141 --> 01:24:49.742]  You're not going to act a fool?
[01:24:49.782 --> 01:24:53.725]  And you're going to have an actual discussion with someone who goes, yes, that's what I'm here for.
[01:24:53.805 --> 01:24:54.865]  I don't want to act crazy.
[01:24:55.546 --> 01:24:56.406]  Two minutes goes by.
[01:24:56.446 --> 01:25:00.629]  This guy's at the fence screaming and yelling and shaking the fence.
[01:25:01.289 --> 01:25:11.325]  You know, F-U, F-U, you're a racist, you're... And then another guy runs up beside him, pulls his pants down, and is like exposing himself, you know, mooning everybody in here.
[01:25:11.545 --> 01:25:14.249]  There's kids walking by, and they're trying to go, and the cops are just kind of like...
[01:25:15.165 --> 01:25:18.748]  They're walking around filming as well, you know, this insanity that's going on.
[01:25:18.768 --> 01:25:26.474]  And, you know, they hate borders, but meanwhile they were using, like, they were building this human wall to stop people from going to see someone.
[01:25:26.494 --> 01:25:29.577]  And it was so ironic to see this whole thing unfold.
[01:25:29.617 --> 01:25:39.926]  They're locking, they're building a wall to not allow people to go do something, and yet they're fighting to not have any walls and to allow everyone to go be free and, you know, talk about whatever.
[01:25:39.946 --> 01:25:41.647]  It's just completely and totally ridiculous.
[01:25:41.807 --> 01:25:45.909]  Do they not realize that they're making everyone that's actually anti-Trump look terrible?
[01:25:46.210 --> 01:25:50.432]  Oh, and you're making these people that love Trump stand even taller.
[01:25:50.872 --> 01:25:53.874]  I mean, these guys were walking through that, coming out with their heads even higher.
[01:25:54.314 --> 01:25:55.415]  Like, just ready, you know?
[01:25:55.815 --> 01:25:59.938]  And I'm sitting out here, and these guys are like, those guys are gonna come out here and they're gonna attack us!
[01:26:00.678 --> 01:26:02.979]  And I'm sitting here like, not one person's thinking about that.
[01:26:02.999 --> 01:26:09.143]  I was like, if you guys left or whatever, if you were willing to have an intelligent conversation and not bother anyone, no one would care.
[01:26:09.603 --> 01:26:16.548]  But by the end of the night, they had blocked the entrances and exits to this convention center, not allowing vehicles to leave.
[01:26:16.908 --> 01:26:24.232]  What's going to happen when you're sitting there with your family and you're trying to get out of there and these crazy people are sitting there blocking off these areas and you can't get out?
[01:26:24.252 --> 01:26:25.933]  They had to scramble, find another
[01:26:27.074 --> 01:26:27.414]  I don't know.
[01:26:42.068 --> 01:26:46.734]  You know, protesting and promoting this La Raza, which means the race of the Mexican KKK.
[01:26:47.094 --> 01:26:52.361]  I saw not one American flag being waved by any of the Hispanics there.
[01:26:52.701 --> 01:26:58.368]  And they were sitting there saying, screw America, we want Azatlan, this is our country, you know, this used to be our land.
[01:26:58.388 --> 01:27:01.271]  Well, sorry, I guess you don't know anything about history because when you lose a war,
[01:27:01.932 --> 01:27:03.633]  That land becomes the winners.
[01:27:03.853 --> 01:27:07.175]  If they wanted that to be their land, they should learn how to fly a little bit better.
[01:27:07.415 --> 01:27:08.435]  It's not even about Trump.
[01:27:08.495 --> 01:27:09.836]  I mean, these people are just mad.
[01:27:10.156 --> 01:27:10.997]  They just hate.
[01:27:12.217 --> 01:27:15.359]  It's funny because they're like, oh, love, Trump's hate.
[01:27:15.399 --> 01:27:22.443]  And then they're spewing hatred, screaming at people, saying they're racist, mooning them, destroying cop cars, blowing things up.
[01:27:23.376 --> 01:27:30.983]  There were cars driving up and down the road, and they had people on both sides, and as the cars walked by, they were like shaking and spitting and yelling at them.
[01:27:31.544 --> 01:27:34.306]  F-U, F-U, you racist, you know, S-O-B, blah, blah, blah.
[01:27:34.627 --> 01:27:40.032]  And those little kids, like, you strap in their car seats, and they're just kind of like looking out the window, like, what the, you know, what the hell's going on?
[01:27:40.052 --> 01:27:45.197]  Well, the truth is, they're just hate-filled people, and they're just using Trump as an excuse to funnel their hatred into.
[01:27:45.817 --> 01:27:46.097]  I think.
[01:27:46.177 --> 01:27:51.580]  I think it's not even political, because you talk to the people that are totally radicalized, and it's not everyone that's anti-Trump.
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:56.603]  Obviously, there's a lot of people that are anti-Trump, including listeners of this show, and I get it.
[01:27:57.043 --> 01:28:01.225]  I'm talking about the crazed people, the hateful, crazed people that we're talking about.
[01:28:01.625 --> 01:28:03.026]  I think Trump is just a scapegoat.
[01:28:03.306 --> 01:28:07.889]  They're just full of hatred, and they're going to spew their garbage anyway, and you talk politics with them.
[01:28:08.789 --> 01:28:09.529]  Don't forget politics.
[01:28:09.689 --> 01:28:10.670]  Talk logic.
[01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:13.971]  You talk real life with them, those people can't even figure it out.
[01:28:14.011 --> 01:28:14.971]  They can't even talk back.
[01:28:15.331 --> 01:28:18.612]  They just spew curse words at you when you talk about anything.
[01:28:19.092 --> 01:28:23.834]  The people that organized that counter-protest, the anti-Trump people, were all La Raza.
[01:28:24.454 --> 01:28:30.258]  They all had La Raza stuff, they all had Mexican flags, and when you saw... By the way, can you break down what La Raza is for people that don't know?
[01:28:30.418 --> 01:28:37.043]  It is the, uh, basically like the Mexican KKK, like Alex calls them, uh, uh, La Raza means the race.
[01:28:37.543 --> 01:28:42.667]  So it's a one race, uh, agenda, kind of like how the KKK wants everyone to be white.
[01:28:43.027 --> 01:28:43.827]  You know, this, uh...
[01:28:45.028 --> 01:28:46.208]  White, you know, blue-eyed.
[01:28:46.728 --> 01:28:47.189]  They're friendly.
[01:28:47.229 --> 01:28:56.011]  And some of the extreme versions of the group say to kill all the white males above 16 years old and basically, you know, I guess kill the women too.
[01:28:56.451 --> 01:28:58.131]  So, very friendly stuff.
[01:28:58.511 --> 01:29:02.852]  Really, really good things to make the anti-terrorist sisters look really, really good.
[01:29:02.912 --> 01:29:04.292]  Anyway, be right back with Joe Biggs.
[01:29:04.332 --> 01:29:04.812]  A lot more.
[01:29:04.832 --> 01:29:06.073]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:06.093 --> 01:29:06.873]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[01:29:08.786 --> 01:29:24.658]  I've been warning you for a long, long time that strategic elites, governmental and corporate power structures have been digging in for a societal and cultural collapse that will make the Great Depression of the 1930s look tame in comparison.
[01:29:32.148 --> 01:29:39.794]  Now, major university studies estimate that more than 7 million Americans starved to death or died via malnutrition during the Great Depression.
[01:29:39.974 --> 01:29:45.058]  The United States fared better than some nations because we were still agrarian.
[01:29:45.138 --> 01:29:46.259]  We were still farmers.
[01:29:46.639 --> 01:29:48.821]  We were not the urban dwellers we are today.
[01:29:49.121 --> 01:29:50.302]  In fact, the numbers have flipped.
[01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:57.768]  In the 1930s, about 89% of people considered themselves rural and about 11% were urban or city.
[01:29:59.853 --> 01:30:07.857]  Now those numbers have basically flipped with maybe 10-11% being rural and upwards of 90% being urban.
[01:30:08.177 --> 01:30:10.698]  We are totally dependent on this system.
[01:30:10.898 --> 01:30:15.441]  And now a top insurer warns global unrest could go viral.
[01:30:16.121 --> 01:30:18.362]  Violent riots threaten international stability.
[01:30:18.662 --> 01:30:27.207]  Lloyds of London has commissioned the leading risk management agency, Risk Advisory Group, to produce a report analyzing these factors.
[01:30:27.527 --> 01:30:32.810]  The story is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:30:33.351 --> 01:30:37.273]  And if you add it into all the other massive preparations that are taking place, it's stunning.
[01:30:37.913 --> 01:30:46.123]  Billionaires in Europe, the United States, and areas like New Zealand are digging in and building multi-billion dollar, in some cases, armored redoubts.
[01:30:46.724 --> 01:30:48.226]  Local governments are digging in.
[01:30:48.687 --> 01:30:52.512]  And then policies are being put in place to shut down half of our power plants.
[01:30:53.052 --> 01:31:00.294]  and cut off our energy and put regulations on farmers that bankrupt them and shut down local industries and jobs.
[01:31:00.574 --> 01:31:01.574]  It's cloward and pivot.
[01:31:01.634 --> 01:31:04.275]  They want us bankrupt so we can be socially engineered.
[01:31:04.655 --> 01:31:08.116]  This is the globalist revolution against humanity.
[01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:16.258]  We have to stand up and say we are the constitutionalist, we are the anti-globalist, we are the nationalist, we are the global pro-human
[01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:18.530]  Renaissance.
[01:31:18.991 --> 01:31:19.411]  Movement.
[01:31:19.911 --> 01:31:20.932]  Whatever you want to call it.
[01:31:21.132 --> 01:31:22.133]  We're against feudalism.
[01:31:22.173 --> 01:31:22.933]  We're against serfdom.
[01:31:23.474 --> 01:31:25.415]  And we have to get armed with the truth.
[01:31:26.135 --> 01:31:27.936]  And we have to get armed with our own gardens.
[01:31:28.337 --> 01:31:29.497]  And we have to get prepared.
[01:31:29.617 --> 01:31:33.460]  Another part of a solution, in closing, is to have storable foods.
[01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:36.362]  If you don't have storable foods, you're totally dependent on the system.
[01:31:37.482 --> 01:31:43.324]  InfoWars Select is the lowest price you're going to find anywhere on high-quality storable foods at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:31:43.764 --> 01:31:49.145]  Find the very best storable foods powered by My Patriot Supply at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:31:49.685 --> 01:31:54.206]  Find our nutraceuticals, it's also key to be as healthy as possible, at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:54.646 --> 01:32:04.349]  And whatever you do, redouble your efforts in the information war and tell your neighbors, your friends, your family, your co-workers, your church members, whoever they are,
[01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:13.663]  That Infowars.com has its finger on the pulse of what's happening and is trying to mobilize humanity in peaceful preparation and resistance against it.
[01:32:13.943 --> 01:32:18.510]  But whatever you do, let's pray for peace and prepare for war.
[01:32:19.657 --> 01:32:23.821]  And when I say war, I mean the globalist war of famine and economic collapse.
[01:32:24.201 --> 01:32:25.462]  They don't want us to be prepared.
[01:32:25.802 --> 01:32:27.083]  They don't want us to be independent.
[01:32:27.484 --> 01:32:29.485]  I hope we never have to use our storable foods.
[01:32:29.906 --> 01:32:32.047]  I hope we never have to defend ourselves with the Second Amendment.
[01:32:32.648 --> 01:32:39.634]  But now it's becoming a probability, almost a certainty, and not just the possibility it was 21 years ago when I first got on air.
[01:32:40.354 --> 01:32:42.596]  Everybody in their gut knows big stuff's happening.
[01:32:42.796 --> 01:32:44.277]  You can also see it economically.
[01:32:44.557 --> 01:32:45.918]  You can also see it culturally.
[01:32:46.438 --> 01:32:48.239]  You can see it unfolding all around you.
[01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:56.365]  Now is the time to get prepared, and the front lines of true preparedness starts at InfoWars.com and InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:56.745 --> 01:33:06.031]  And finally, when you shop with the good guys, you're helping fund the tip of the spear in the information war that's so key while getting the high-quality products you and your family desperately need.
[01:33:12.825 --> 01:33:15.432]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:46.164 --> 01:33:48.325]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:48.826 --> 01:33:54.069]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:58.712 --> 01:34:00.073]  Friday, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:00.273 --> 01:34:02.235]  Anthony Gucciardi with Joe Biggs.
[01:34:03.035 --> 01:34:04.336]  Picking some metal.
[01:34:05.297 --> 01:34:06.738]  Bad to the bone metal.
[01:34:08.022 --> 01:34:09.984]  Speed Metal, Megadeth, actually an amazing band.
[01:34:10.244 --> 01:34:11.225]  Big fan myself.
[01:34:12.326 --> 01:34:16.148]  So listen, we're going to talk about Uber and Lyft leaving Austin.
[01:34:16.168 --> 01:34:18.670]  We're going to talk about no Muslims on German soil.
[01:34:18.750 --> 01:34:24.095]  Quote, thousands of right-wing extremists rally outside Berlin train station against city's influx of refugees.
[01:34:24.395 --> 01:34:27.537]  Some more about what Bigg saw at the anti-Trump rally.
[01:34:28.018 --> 01:34:31.220]  Army shrinks to smallest level since before World War II.
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:32.481]  I want to get Joe's take on that.
[01:34:32.781 --> 01:34:34.723]  But first, but first,
[01:34:36.237 --> 01:34:50.971]  It is actually my failure to only mention this a couple times already, is that the storable food sale, the unprecedented storable food sale at InfoWarsStore.com, 30-40% off all of the storable food, and 10% off all preparedness items.
[01:34:51.111 --> 01:34:54.435]  InfoWarsStore.com has to end tonight at midnight.
[01:34:55.333 --> 01:34:58.554]  Alright, Alex was talking about ending it before and we extended it.
[01:34:58.794 --> 01:35:00.274]  We're on the phone with the manufacturer.
[01:35:00.534 --> 01:35:03.495]  They're not exactly happy about it and I talked to him before the show.
[01:35:03.575 --> 01:35:05.735]  It has to end tonight at midnight.
[01:35:06.255 --> 01:35:08.416]  So that was already discounted storable food.
[01:35:08.436 --> 01:35:09.976]  Stuff that I use and I have.
[01:35:10.496 --> 01:35:14.237]  It is 30 to 40 percent off now and it will end tonight at midnight.
[01:35:14.277 --> 01:35:18.798]  So the sale will officially be over and we're not going to be able to run it for a very long time.
[01:35:20.038 --> 01:35:24.060]  Alex is unable to run this, obviously, because number one, it's basically a loss leader.
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:30.024]  Number two, the manufacturer gets upset and we're only supposed to run it for like a day or something.
[01:35:30.724 --> 01:35:31.565]  And number three...
[01:35:33.294 --> 01:35:34.494]  It's about time, okay?
[01:35:35.495 --> 01:35:40.036]  It's about time to get prepared now, and we can't continue to give 30-40% off.
[01:35:40.336 --> 01:35:43.297]  So there it is, storable food and 10% off preparedness items.
[01:35:43.337 --> 01:35:45.278]  But the storable food is ending tonight, 12 a.m.
[01:35:45.598 --> 01:35:46.678]  Discount is over.
[01:35:46.818 --> 01:35:48.799]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:35:49.399 --> 01:35:51.360]  Shelf life of like 25 years, the real deal.
[01:35:52.065 --> 01:35:54.167]  Now, Joe Biggs, let's talk about a couple things.
[01:35:54.727 --> 01:35:58.951]  So I do want to get your take on Army shrinks to smallest levels since before World War II.
[01:35:59.331 --> 01:36:04.056]  But first, so Uber and Lyft have left Austin as of 5 a.m.
[01:36:04.596 --> 01:36:04.976]  Monday.
[01:36:05.717 --> 01:36:12.723]  They put 8.6 million dollars into a campaign to keep fingerprinting on their end and they essentially
[01:36:13.644 --> 01:36:20.571]  Proposition 1 wanted Uber to pay the city to run background checks and do training for its drivers under the guise of safety.
[01:36:20.591 --> 01:36:32.184]  A lot of people said it's like total BS and basically that Uber is being kind of shaken through the coals and that the city wants more money and they want to charge fees to Uber and they want to take a little bit of their cut.
[01:36:32.584 --> 01:36:34.686]  And you offered some interesting perspective.
[01:36:35.543 --> 01:36:37.003]  I must say, it is a conspiracy theory.
[01:36:38.264 --> 01:36:39.964]  But it's an interesting perspective.
[01:36:39.984 --> 01:36:41.064]  Tell me what you were telling me earlier.
[01:36:41.084 --> 01:36:48.946]  Well, so, you know, not only are there tons of people losing jobs, you know, this is a great starter job when you move to a new city.
[01:36:49.406 --> 01:36:52.447]  Anytime I get, I use Lyft daily almost.
[01:36:52.727 --> 01:36:58.108]  It's going to be a huge crush on my transportation because you can't find parking downtown, all that stuff.
[01:36:58.148 --> 01:37:00.649]  It just makes more sense to use Lyft or Uber or whatever.
[01:37:03.052 --> 01:37:08.494]  What's going on is now they have to leave because of the fact that they don't want to pay the city.
[01:37:08.694 --> 01:37:11.296]  And they don't want to set a precedent, because other cities will do the same thing.
[01:37:11.336 --> 01:37:11.536]  Yeah.
[01:37:11.556 --> 01:37:13.737]  This might happen, by the way, all throughout the United States.
[01:37:13.957 --> 01:37:15.077]  It's already happened in Midland.
[01:37:15.097 --> 01:37:16.658]  They're lobbying all the city council people.
[01:37:16.698 --> 01:37:19.379]  It's happened in a couple other little cities throughout Texas as well.
[01:37:19.819 --> 01:37:21.640]  But this is going to be the largest hit on them.
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:26.222]  And like you said, the city wants money because here's the thing, here's the kicker.
[01:37:26.622 --> 01:37:29.843]  Since Uber and Lyft have been in Austin, the DUIs have gone down about 20%.
[01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:35.333]  So, we have roughly now a little over 2 million people.
[01:37:35.633 --> 01:37:37.154]  When I moved here 2 years ago, there was about 800,000.
[01:37:37.194 --> 01:37:38.135]  We're at 2 million now, 2 years later.
[01:37:38.175 --> 01:37:38.435]  Ridiculous!
[01:37:42.881 --> 01:37:55.104]  That's about 30 DUIs a day or something like that at $8,000 to $10,000 per case that the city is not getting because of Uber and Lyft, these ride-sharing apps that really help people out.
[01:37:55.124 --> 01:37:56.605]  It cuts down that whole thing.
[01:37:56.745 --> 01:38:01.566]  Now, by taking this away and forcing these guys pretty much out with this Prop 1,
[01:38:03.177 --> 01:38:06.038]  Now you're going to have people forced with, are they going to drink and drive?
[01:38:06.078 --> 01:38:07.558]  Are they going to take that chance now?
[01:38:08.159 --> 01:38:09.359]  Or are they just not going to go out?
[01:38:09.399 --> 01:38:10.319]  Is it going to hurt the economy?
[01:38:10.419 --> 01:38:11.660]  People are going to drink and drive.
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:14.001]  People are going to drink and drive, but it's going to happen more though now.
[01:38:14.181 --> 01:38:14.361]  Yeah.
[01:38:14.401 --> 01:38:17.582]  Because you know, for me, like when I go out, I like to go out and drink some beers.
[01:38:17.862 --> 01:38:18.982]  I take a Lyft or an Uber.
[01:38:19.302 --> 01:38:20.943]  It's 10 times harder to get a cab.
[01:38:21.343 --> 01:38:23.445]  Now you've got to plan things out a lot further.
[01:38:23.465 --> 01:38:24.205]  You've got to do a lot of stuff.
[01:38:24.445 --> 01:38:25.686]  And a lot of people out there are pretty lazy.
[01:38:25.706 --> 01:38:26.347]  They're not going to do it.
[01:38:26.367 --> 01:38:28.929]  They're going to take that risk and go, I haven't had many.
[01:38:28.989 --> 01:38:30.690]  I'm going to drive anyways.
[01:38:30.710 --> 01:38:32.911]  And the next thing you know, their DUIs are going back up.
[01:38:32.931 --> 01:38:33.532]  They're making money.
[01:38:33.572 --> 01:38:38.475]  The police departments, at the end of the day, the government, this is an institution to make money off of you.
[01:38:38.716 --> 01:38:41.157]  They say they want to cut down on DUI, drinking and driving.
[01:38:41.177 --> 01:38:42.618]  They want you to wear your seatbelts.
[01:38:42.638 --> 01:38:44.780]  They want to do all this stuff and act like they're here to help.
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:46.181]  But at the end of the day, they're making money.
[01:38:46.201 --> 01:38:47.362]  They're trying to generate revenue.
[01:38:47.722 --> 01:38:48.523]  It's weird, right?
[01:38:48.543 --> 01:38:53.486]  Because on one side, you're like, wow, we are just kind of feeding into this corporation of Uber and Lyft.
[01:39:08.775 --> 01:39:12.579]  Oh, poor Uber and Lyft, these billion-dollar companies, they're pushing out.
[01:39:12.679 --> 01:39:25.390]  But at the same time, if the city is really concerned about these scary Uber drivers without background checks, isn't there more public safety concern about people drunk driving and dying and killing other people that are innocent?
[01:39:25.730 --> 01:39:30.114]  And I mean, the goal should not to be getting people with DUIs, obviously.
[01:39:30.154 --> 01:39:30.595]  You know what I mean?
[01:39:30.695 --> 01:39:31.696]  I see your point, it's interesting.
[01:39:32.436 --> 01:39:48.070]  Um, I think regardless, even though it is Uber and it is kind of weird to be like, oh this poor corporation, I think it's indisputable, it's a safety issue, that more people, period, you know how many people I see downtown, they're going to drive drunk, they don't care, and you know what's going to happen?
[01:39:48.530 --> 01:39:59.000]  People are going to go out because they don't read the news, they don't know anything, a lot of people unfortunately, and they're going to get on Uber, and it's going to be 2am, they're drunk, alright, next Friday or whatever, and it's going to be like, no, sorry, we don't do Austin anymore.
[01:39:59.602 --> 01:40:03.966]  I don't feel bad for Uber or anything like that, but I mean, here's the thing, if I created Uber,
[01:40:22.938 --> 01:40:28.039]  I have the right to be successful and make tons of money if it's working, but it's not, it's not, you know, poor Uber.
[01:40:28.179 --> 01:40:29.720]  I think it's... No, I wasn't saying you're saying that.
[01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:30.100]  Well, yeah, yeah.
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:38.202]  It's just there were people, like, protesting and stuff, like, Uber, Uber, like, oh my God, Uber's just, you know, being destroyed, just such a martyr, you know?
[01:40:38.282 --> 01:40:38.422]  Yeah.
[01:40:38.882 --> 01:40:41.183]  It's really just... I mean, I just feel bad for the people that need it.
[01:40:41.203 --> 01:40:41.843]  Yeah, of course.
[01:40:41.863 --> 01:40:44.204]  Because a lot of my buddies don't have cars in Austin.
[01:40:44.764 --> 01:40:53.634]  Because, I mean, and it makes it easier for the transportation, like waiting on a bus, that can take a long time, you know, to learn the schedules.
[01:40:53.654 --> 01:40:55.375]  I mean, all you gotta do is hop on your phone, boom, I won it.
[01:40:55.396 --> 01:40:56.156]  That's the easiest thing ever.
[01:40:56.457 --> 01:41:01.202]  And if other cities do this, it's gonna be pretty much detrimental for going downtown and drinking or whatever.
[01:41:01.562 --> 01:41:02.503]  Now it's shifting gears.
[01:41:02.923 --> 01:41:05.185]  Army shrinks the smallest level since before World War II.
[01:41:05.686 --> 01:41:16.455]  The Army's latest headcount shows that nearly 2,600 soldiers departed active service in March without being replaced, an action that plunges manning to its lowest level since before World War II.
[01:41:16.736 --> 01:41:20.999]  During the past years, the size of the active force has been reduced by 16,548 soldiers, the rough equivalent of three brigades.
[01:41:24.122 --> 01:41:32.968]  Now, in strength for March was 479,172, which is 154 fewer troops than were on active duty when the Army halted the post-Cold War drawdown in 1999.
[01:41:33.028 --> 01:41:36.891]  What do you think about that, as someone who's been in the military?
[01:41:37.352 --> 01:41:42.355]  The despicable thing about the whole thing is it's not people getting out, like they were
[01:41:44.138 --> 01:41:46.839]  You know, getting out of the army already and, you know, their time was up.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:57.304]  A lot of these people were actually serving in combat in Afghanistan and were literally handed slips like officers saying, hey, you're still going to be deployed, but when you get back, you're not going to have a job.
[01:41:57.324 --> 01:41:58.025]  All right.
[01:41:58.105 --> 01:42:00.046]  Enjoy the rest of your six months here in Afghanistan.
[01:42:00.306 --> 01:42:01.426]  Thanks for fighting for America.
[01:42:01.727 --> 01:42:02.827]  That's how they're dealing with it.
[01:42:02.867 --> 01:42:04.428]  That's one of the horrible things about it.
[01:42:04.828 --> 01:42:10.571]  You know, and everyone's like, you know, our our our military is so big, you know, and Trump keeps going, we're going to make it bigger, better, stronger.
[01:42:10.991 --> 01:42:11.351]  You know what?
[01:42:11.391 --> 01:42:12.792]  We live in a world where there's bad people.
[01:42:12.912 --> 01:42:23.276]  There's a lot of people out there with superpowers that have nuclear capabilities that hate us, that hate our freedoms, hate what we stand for, what we represent, hate the fact that some of them feel like they've been betrayed or screwed over with some of these faulty wars.
[01:42:23.336 --> 01:42:25.036]  I mean, at the end of the day, guess what?
[01:42:25.096 --> 01:42:26.877]  We need to have a strong military.
[01:42:26.897 --> 01:42:32.899]  It doesn't mean that we need to have tanks running up and down or anything like that, but we should have good numbers in case someone flexes.
[01:42:33.359 --> 01:42:38.641]  We can do something, you know, and people should be able to want to join right now if they want to serve their country.
[01:42:38.681 --> 01:42:39.141]  That's fine.
[01:42:39.281 --> 01:42:39.561]  It's true.
[01:42:39.601 --> 01:42:41.402]  And Joe, I forgot, we're going to give out the phone number.
[01:42:41.642 --> 01:42:44.263]  Take your calls on the myriad of issues we've been talking about.
[01:42:44.463 --> 01:42:44.643]  It's 877-789-2539.
[01:42:44.663 --> 01:42:44.743]  877-789-2539.
[01:42:44.803 --> 01:42:45.123]  Call in.
[01:42:45.163 --> 01:42:47.764]  Next segment, we're going to take your calls, so hurry up.
[01:42:47.784 --> 01:42:47.904]  877-789-2539.
[01:42:47.944 --> 01:42:51.125]  Hear your thoughts on all the issues we're talking about.
[01:42:51.185 --> 01:42:53.906]  Be back next segment with Biggs, and we'll answer your calls.
[01:42:53.926 --> 01:42:55.566]  Anthony Gucciardi, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:08.915 --> 01:43:09.936]  Brain Force is here.
[01:43:10.457 --> 01:43:12.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:20.830]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:43:21.604 --> 01:43:24.766]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[01:43:25.046 --> 01:43:25.187]  Right?
[01:43:25.207 --> 01:43:27.548]  You're gonna crash and you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[01:43:27.908 --> 01:43:31.411]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[01:43:31.471 --> 01:43:34.613]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[01:43:35.114 --> 01:43:39.897]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[01:43:40.457 --> 01:43:42.279]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[01:43:42.639 --> 01:43:47.062]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[01:43:47.222 --> 01:43:49.223]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[01:43:49.844 --> 01:43:51.325]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[01:43:51.465 --> 01:43:51.705]  Exactly.
[01:43:51.725 --> 01:43:55.529]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[01:43:56.030 --> 01:44:03.297]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:44:12.045 --> 01:44:21.650]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by Infowarslife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[01:45:06.048 --> 01:45:10.549]  Joe Bakes here with InfoWars.com.
[01:45:10.609 --> 01:45:12.630]  Today I want to talk to you about guns.
[01:45:12.910 --> 01:45:13.790]  Why we have them.
[01:45:13.970 --> 01:45:17.251]  Why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have them.
[01:45:17.351 --> 01:45:22.573]  And why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against it in the press.
[01:45:22.833 --> 01:45:29.796]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered more essential than the First Amendment.
[01:45:29.876 --> 01:45:40.341]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[01:45:40.621 --> 01:45:44.063]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[01:45:46.164 --> 01:45:53.108]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[01:45:53.308 --> 01:45:55.849]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[01:45:55.969 --> 01:45:58.711]  It doesn't recognize color, or class, or wealth.
[01:45:58.831 --> 01:46:05.314]  It protects not just the rights of actors, or editors, or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[01:46:05.415 --> 01:46:07.976]  This is a small excerpt from Charlton Heston.
[01:46:08.416 --> 01:46:09.757]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:46:10.057 --> 01:46:11.338]  You can't survive without it.
[01:46:11.538 --> 01:46:12.439]  But where do you get it?
[01:46:12.739 --> 01:46:18.504]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:46:18.724 --> 01:46:24.469]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:46:24.649 --> 01:46:32.415]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities.
[01:46:35.177 --> 01:46:41.504]  Including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:46:41.904 --> 01:46:44.026]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:46:44.386 --> 01:46:45.588]  Stainless steel construction.
[01:46:45.868 --> 01:46:46.589]  Easy assembly.
[01:46:46.909 --> 01:46:47.530]  Low maintenance.
[01:46:47.810 --> 01:46:49.652]  Replacement filters are simple to install.
[01:46:49.912 --> 01:46:55.918]  And now, as part of an exclusive limited time introductory offer, you can save $20 off the retail price.
[01:46:56.298 --> 01:46:57.519]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:31.093 --> 01:47:34.075]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:47:34.655 --> 01:47:38.877]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:41.598 --> 01:47:42.559]  Alright, we're back.
[01:47:42.619 --> 01:47:48.241]  We're taking your calls at 877-789-2539.
[01:47:48.261 --> 01:47:48.621]  877-789-2539.
[01:47:49.122 --> 01:47:54.664]  Call board is pretty much lit up right now, but we have a couple spots.
[01:47:54.684 --> 01:47:57.726]  If you want to talk about any of the issues we're talking about today,
[01:47:59.397 --> 01:48:03.701]  From, Army shrinks to smallest level since before World War II.
[01:48:04.581 --> 01:48:08.465]  The story I talked about earlier, which is, I think, the most important of the day.
[01:48:08.865 --> 01:48:14.970]  Court orders man to forfeit nearly $20,000 despite no criminal charges and prosecutors attempt to dismiss case.
[01:48:15.391 --> 01:48:18.053]  They found $20,000 in his laptop bag.
[01:48:18.673 --> 01:48:22.476]  No drugs, nothing, he didn't do anything wrong, but the dog barked.
[01:48:23.450 --> 01:48:25.953]  So, that was enough for them to seize all his money.
[01:48:26.453 --> 01:48:34.262]  And it turns out, in Arkansas, between 2000 and 2014, law enforcement seized more than $80 million in cash and over 9,500 vehicles.
[01:48:36.826 --> 01:48:40.248]  So yeah, pretty insane if you didn't catch that in the beginning.
[01:48:40.688 --> 01:48:54.616]  Also about the FBI and Clinton, basically the FBI saying we might be able to move, might be ready to move and make a final judgment, and former FBI agents saying that Hillary Clinton did demonstrate gross negligence in handling the servers.
[01:48:55.196 --> 01:48:56.817]  Well, that's just some of the news we've been talking about.
[01:48:56.837 --> 01:48:59.318]  Austin banning, or rather Lyft leaving Austin.
[01:48:59.698 --> 01:49:02.440]  Man accused of putting mouse poison on food arranged.
[01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:04.921]  What a mentally deranged person.
[01:49:04.941 --> 01:49:12.025]  29-year-old Ann Arbor man suspected of spraying food with rodent poison mixture at Ann Arbor area grocery store was arraigned Thursday in a district court.
[01:49:12.045 --> 01:49:14.126]  Authorities brought charges against him.
[01:49:14.146 --> 01:49:20.689]  He was faced with four felony counts of poisoning food or water, carrying potential penalties as much as $15,000 each and 20 years in prison.
[01:49:22.370 --> 01:49:29.294]  I can think of a few companies that could probably face those charges as well, and most likely should as well, for destroying the food and water supply.
[01:49:29.314 --> 01:49:32.115]  Does it rhyme with Onsanto?
[01:49:33.336 --> 01:49:36.657]  There's quite a few, you know, and I'm surprised they pay any tax.
[01:49:37.017 --> 01:49:42.420]  So alright, we're going to go ahead and pick some of these callers here in a moment.
[01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:43.461]  Some more are just coming in.
[01:49:43.781 --> 01:49:49.504]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jimmy in Michigan, who wants to talk about the military.
[01:49:49.524 --> 01:49:50.244]  What's on your mind, Jimmy?
[01:49:53.666 --> 01:49:54.066]  Jimmy, you there?
[01:49:55.087 --> 01:49:55.587]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:55.688 --> 01:49:56.448]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:49:56.648 --> 01:49:57.169]  How's it going?
[01:49:57.269 --> 01:49:58.770]  So what do you want to talk about the military today?
[01:49:59.450 --> 01:50:01.692]  And if you wouldn't mind me getting your phone so it's not on speaker.
[01:50:01.812 --> 01:50:05.475]  No, I'm not on speaker phone, I don't think.
[01:50:06.355 --> 01:50:07.456]  Oh, what's on your mind, my friend?
[01:50:07.476 --> 01:50:11.959]  Alright, Jimmy, sorry.
[01:50:11.979 --> 01:50:19.225]  We're going to have to drop you though just because the phone connection is bad and I don't want the audience to have to listen to that noise in the background.
[01:50:20.174 --> 01:50:22.575]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Charles in Georgia.
[01:50:22.635 --> 01:50:25.697]  He wants to talk about Donald Trump.
[01:50:25.937 --> 01:50:31.900]  No one ever talks about Donald Trump, so I'll tell you what, Charles, I want to hear something original about Donald Trump today.
[01:50:33.161 --> 01:50:33.921]  What you got for me?
[01:50:34.042 --> 01:50:47.429]  Oh, you're going to definitely hear something original, because I'm another black supporter that supports Donald Trump, and I'm tired of people in the South, or people in general, calling Donald Trump a racist.
[01:50:48.049 --> 01:50:49.130]  And he's not a racist.
[01:50:50.137 --> 01:50:57.583]  Donald Trump has done more for the black community and for minority communities than anybody in the Democratic Party right there.
[01:50:57.603 --> 01:50:58.664]  That's real talk right there.
[01:50:59.204 --> 01:51:00.365]  Yeah, I like the real talk.
[01:51:00.425 --> 01:51:08.832]  You can see all the charities that he's donated money to and everything, and you can see where he's donated to minority groups in New York City.
[01:51:08.872 --> 01:51:14.836]  And by the way, New York City is the most liberal, is one of the most liberal states in America.
[01:51:14.896 --> 01:51:18.299]  There's no way, if Donald Trump was a racist, there's no way he could make it.
[01:51:18.917 --> 01:51:23.379]  Uh, as being there in one of the most liberal states in America.
[01:51:23.879 --> 01:51:30.702]  But with that said, I got a documentary film that I'd like to share with you guys at InfoWars.
[01:51:30.722 --> 01:51:34.463]  You can go on over to YouTube and check out The Nation of Truth.
[01:51:34.783 --> 01:51:37.524]  And we got a film called Black Origins Untold.
[01:51:38.145 --> 01:51:44.127]  And we got a film that talks about the hip-hop community being infiltrated by the Illuminati to poison the minds of black people.
[01:51:44.707 --> 01:51:46.848]  We also have where they're stealing
[01:51:47.375 --> 01:51:48.016]  Yeah, he will be.
[01:52:03.951 --> 01:52:04.431]  Well, you know what?
[01:52:04.451 --> 01:52:05.132]  Let me tell you, Charles.
[01:52:05.612 --> 01:52:07.494]  Hey, you answered my wish.
[01:52:07.534 --> 01:52:08.455]  It wasn't an original call.
[01:52:08.755 --> 01:52:11.478]  It wasn't just a standard talk on Trump.
[01:52:11.918 --> 01:52:16.963]  It's interesting to me, as I've said about five billion times, I'm not even sitting here saying I'm a Trump supporter.
[01:52:17.463 --> 01:52:27.072]  But it's interesting to me, Charles, I like that you said this is real talk because, number one, when I talk to people and they say, well, Donald Trump is racist and you're a racist if you even say anything about it.
[01:52:28.641 --> 01:52:31.183]  Well, number one, I always say, you know, to give me a specific example, they can't do it.
[01:52:31.404 --> 01:52:42.654]  They just spew hatred, and it sounds like you're actually a reasonable guy, can speak well, and say, hey man, you know, I'm from Philadelphia also, so I get when you say it's a liberal city.
[01:52:42.694 --> 01:52:53.664]  I've been in New York a million times, New York City, and Philadelphia is extremely liberal, New York City is extremely liberal, to the point where you're told in Philadelphia when you're looking for a job, well just make sure you're registered Democrat.
[01:52:54.366 --> 01:52:54.646]  Yeah.
[01:52:54.726 --> 01:52:55.947]  They're not going to like you if you're not.
[01:52:56.187 --> 01:52:56.428]  Yeah.
[01:52:56.448 --> 01:52:56.688]  Okay?
[01:52:57.068 --> 01:53:02.592]  So, yeah, obviously, I mean, there's a lot to discuss there instead of just screaming that he's racist.
[01:53:02.792 --> 01:53:05.314]  The elite, the mainstream media, they're all scared of this guy.
[01:53:05.614 --> 01:53:08.956]  Completely and totally, because they know he's not going to take a lot of this BS.
[01:53:08.996 --> 01:53:10.237]  He's not going to put up with their crap.
[01:53:11.238 --> 01:53:14.820]  And that's why they keep pushing these campaigns that promote the fact that he's a racist.
[01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:20.922]  And they try to make you think that the only real candidate that you have to choose from right now is Hillary Clinton.
[01:53:21.262 --> 01:53:28.486]  But if you look at her numbers now compared to 2012 when she ran that first time, they're way lower.
[01:53:29.486 --> 01:53:30.246]  Way lower now.
[01:53:30.586 --> 01:53:33.087]  Her ratings, her votes, all that stuff, way lower.
[01:53:33.487 --> 01:53:41.029]  And now you take this nominee, this Donald Trump, and you look at him, he has the most turnout out of any GOP nominee ever.
[01:53:42.190 --> 01:53:47.271]  Smashing every person's record thus far in an election cycle.
[01:53:48.382 --> 01:53:54.608]  But they keep telling you when you turn on TV every time, he's going to destroy America, he's a racist, he's a bigot, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:53:55.069 --> 01:53:59.693]  You know, this guy's going to, you know, no, they're scared and they're saying that because they know they're going to get shut down.
[01:53:59.713 --> 01:54:01.836]  These elites know they're going to have nowhere to go.
[01:54:01.856 --> 01:54:08.122]  And he's going to start pulling a lot of this stuff away from the political side and make these guys get out of there.
[01:54:08.382 --> 01:54:08.442]  Yes.
[01:54:38.302 --> 01:54:39.304]  It's the same thing that's happening.
[01:54:39.424 --> 01:54:39.664]  It is.
[01:54:39.704 --> 01:54:42.889]  You know, I gotta tell you, I don't know Donald Trump's true intentions.
[01:54:43.809 --> 01:54:44.590]  Okay, either do you.
[01:54:44.970 --> 01:54:46.151]  Nope, he's shaking it up though.
[01:54:46.171 --> 01:54:49.313]  He could get in and be the worst president in human history.
[01:54:49.653 --> 01:54:50.634]  But I will say one thing.
[01:54:51.275 --> 01:54:59.261]  The support for Donald Trump is representative of a true hatred and a true disillusion and a true isolation from the political establishment.
[01:54:59.301 --> 01:55:01.162]  And that is the most riveting and powerful point.
[01:55:01.362 --> 01:55:05.405]  And I think the establishment is not only afraid of Donald Trump, they're afraid of anything they can't control.
[01:55:05.725 --> 01:55:09.108]  If you look, they're doing a lot of the same things to Bernie Sanders.
[01:55:09.408 --> 01:55:09.588]  Yeah.
[01:55:09.848 --> 01:55:10.769]  They're just afraid, man.
[01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:12.891]  They know they can control Hillary Clinton.
[01:55:13.351 --> 01:55:17.054]  They know that they basically, you know, Hillary is 100% establishment.
[01:55:17.414 --> 01:55:20.216]  They know that they could have done the same with someone like Marco Rubio.
[01:55:20.617 --> 01:55:22.558]  But they're afraid of the outlier.
[01:55:22.778 --> 01:55:24.580]  They're afraid of the wild cards.
[01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:27.222]  And not even that the wild cards may be the best thing in the world.
[01:55:27.762 --> 01:55:35.128]  But God, they represent something that the population is completely done with the establishment and that is the most scary thing in the world.
[01:55:35.148 --> 01:55:44.916]  Well it's like it worked against Ron Paul, it worked against Rand Paul, they were able to sideline these guys and get them out of there because they know that these guys would come in, shake Washington up, and kick a lot of these people to the curb.
[01:55:45.337 --> 01:55:52.903]  You know, and for some reason, everything that they did to those two guys, they tried to do it to Trump, didn't work, and there's more and more people coming out.
[01:55:53.123 --> 01:56:00.049]  First they laugh and say it's a joke, it'll never happen, and then make, oh it'll never actually, he'll never be the nominee, and then they attack, attack, attack, attack, attack.
[01:56:00.770 --> 01:56:02.151]  Anyway, let's go to some more calls here.
[01:56:03.311 --> 01:56:09.976]  Why don't we go to John in Oklahoma who also wants to talk about military and ask Joe Biggs a question.
[01:56:10.016 --> 01:56:10.856]  John, what's on your mind?
[01:56:11.737 --> 01:56:12.818]  Yes, good evening.
[01:56:13.298 --> 01:56:14.439]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:56:14.479 --> 01:56:17.381]  I just want to ask Joe... Thank you for calling in.
[01:56:18.882 --> 01:56:21.704]  There's a few... He knows what a sheepdog is.
[01:56:22.204 --> 01:56:30.330]  There's a few guys out here that possess the techniques and the qualification to go ahead and defeat IEDs.
[01:56:31.411 --> 01:56:32.812]  Do you think we're going to see
[01:56:35.951 --> 01:56:41.693]  In our communities, we're going to have to deploy our personal dogs to do that task?
[01:56:42.853 --> 01:56:43.953]  I mean, it's a possibility.
[01:56:43.973 --> 01:56:50.115]  I mean, they just found an IED under a bridge in a town, I believe, called... That's what I'm referring to.
[01:56:50.135 --> 01:56:55.277]  Yeah, in Rosebud, Texas, right outside of... I can't think of the name of the city right now.
[01:56:55.757 --> 01:56:57.777]  But, yeah, there was an IED found out there.
[01:56:58.037 --> 01:56:59.718]  And, you know, we already know the borders are open.
[01:56:59.778 --> 01:57:03.559]  We know that ISIS has got a guy down there who's been training in an opera.
[01:57:04.019 --> 01:57:17.447]  You know, it's only a matter of time before those tactics that we saw in Iraq on convoys, that we saw in Afghanistan, are eventually going to come across the borders, our poorest border, and be used against us on, you know, roadways and things like that.
[01:57:18.048 --> 01:57:25.652]  And it's going to be hard at first because we don't have a police force that's used to dealing with that kind of, you know, problem, you know.
[01:57:25.812 --> 01:57:30.035]  And then that's what's going to be the scary thing is, are we going to have the time and the resources to train?
[01:57:30.655 --> 01:57:41.142]  The police to defeat IEDs or then they're gonna bring in military EOD teams to take over and have convoys doing route clearance up and down major interstates and things like that.
[01:57:41.222 --> 01:57:42.703]  So it's definitely gonna be an interesting future.
[01:57:42.723 --> 01:57:43.804]  That is a scary thought.
[01:57:44.425 --> 01:57:47.186]  Alright, well Alex will be back tomorrow from 11 a.m.
[01:57:47.206 --> 01:57:47.727]  to 2 p.m.
