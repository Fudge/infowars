[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:02.636]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:15.905 --> 00:00:20.068]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:21.549]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.231]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:27.554]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.054 --> 00:00:32.118]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.691]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:40.675]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Thursday, and we have a lot of news.
[00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:43.937]  Alex Jones is going to be calling us in the next segment.
[00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:48.581]  He's got a report that he has filed about the arrest of Cliven Bundy.
[00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:52.385]  Of course, Cliven Bundy announced last night that he was going to be heading to Oregon.
[00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:54.466]  There was a live broadcast.
[00:00:54.486 --> 00:00:56.828]  We're going to have an update on what's going on in that situation.
[00:00:56.849 --> 00:01:02.253]  The last four people who were there in that refuge went out, broadcast last night that they were being surrounded by the FBI.
[00:01:03.354 --> 00:01:05.415]  They also called Franklin Graham.
[00:01:05.455 --> 00:01:06.715]  He is also on his way.
[00:01:07.255 --> 00:01:09.796]  Presumably they won't arrest Franklin Graham.
[00:01:10.596 --> 00:01:27.341]  They arrested Cliven Bundy on conspiracy charges and they say that it relates to what happened in Nevada because clearly when you look at the message that went out last night he said it's time for all we the people, Americans, Patriots, Militia, we need to go and we need to be louder than they are.
[00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:28.862]  He didn't go with arms.
[00:01:29.182 --> 00:01:30.843]  He's not calling for violent revolution.
[00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:33.205]  He's not conspiring to overthrow the government.
[00:01:33.245 --> 00:01:36.748]  He's exercising, just as the others were, his First Amendment rights.
[00:01:37.228 --> 00:01:39.450]  We have a right to peacefully assemble.
[00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.872]  We have a right to petition our government for redress of grievances.
[00:01:43.313 --> 00:01:48.897]  You know, that's the right to complain about your government, the right to complain to your government.
[00:01:49.237 --> 00:01:52.600]  A lot of people are very upset because these guys showed up with weapons, you know.
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.502]  Well, we have a Second Amendment that covers that as well.
[00:01:55.802 --> 00:01:57.103]  You have a right to keep and bear arms.
[00:01:57.123 --> 00:02:00.104]  They didn't violate the Second Amendment, which protects that.
[00:02:00.164 --> 00:02:02.405]  There's a state law that doesn't conflict with that either.
[00:02:02.425 --> 00:02:06.227]  Of course, we said from the beginning that this is what this was about.
[00:02:06.307 --> 00:02:11.449]  That they wanted to get the Bundy family as an act of revenge for what happened in Nevada.
[00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.313]  I think it's very clear that you have to do this neighborhood by neighborhood.
[00:02:16.753 --> 00:02:26.622]  That neighborhood woke up when they saw the excessive use of force, when they saw the BLM come in and rope off a little remote area in the middle of the desert and say First Amendment area.
[00:02:26.722 --> 00:02:27.542]  It was outrageous.
[00:02:28.263 --> 00:02:35.865]  The violence, the predation, the negating of our First Amendment rights had angered the community.
[00:02:35.885 --> 00:02:39.066]  They stood together and helped him to take his cattle back.
[00:02:39.646 --> 00:02:44.327]  And if they're saying that that was a conspiracy, Cliven Bundy clearly said, I'm not telling anybody what to do.
[00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:46.248]  I'm telling you what I'm doing.
[00:02:47.168 --> 00:03:02.932]  I was there, we've got it on tape, so that's something where we need to stand together, we need to understand what's going on, but we need to understand that it has to be done community by community, it has to be done in a way that people clearly understand that this is a defensive operation, not an offensive operation.
[00:03:02.952 --> 00:03:14.296]  They went into Oregon, they didn't know the people there, the territory, they were easily portrayed by the leftist media as being dangerous, aggressive yahoos, and there were some dangerous, aggressive yahoos there.
[00:03:14.336 --> 00:03:15.436]  We said from the very beginning,
[00:03:16.036 --> 00:03:24.620]  That there are Fed provocateurs that were pushing them to do things that made absolutely no sense from a strategic standpoint, from a tactical standpoint.
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:35.345]  When they wanted to go talk to people at a meeting with 400 people, they wanted to talk about what could be done in terms of managing the public lands better by doing it at a local level.
[00:03:35.805 --> 00:03:37.007]  They were going to have a peaceful meeting.
[00:03:37.047 --> 00:03:41.612]  Clearly the community of 400 people were not afraid of these people going to speak to them.
[00:03:41.652 --> 00:03:44.315]  That's when they arrested the group that was going there.
[00:03:44.636 --> 00:03:46.138]  That's when they shot Lavoie Finnegan.
[00:03:46.658 --> 00:03:48.981]  So Alex Jones is going to be talking to us about that.
[00:03:49.401 --> 00:03:52.745]  We also have news about the global financial meltdown continuing.
[00:03:53.717 --> 00:03:56.219]  We have another day of massive stocks.
[00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.721]  It's not really news anymore.
[00:03:57.741 --> 00:03:59.182]  We don't cover this on a daily basis.
[00:03:59.242 --> 00:04:02.325]  Every day there's hundreds of points being lost.
[00:04:02.425 --> 00:04:04.627]  One market or the other is going down several percent.
[00:04:05.247 --> 00:04:08.891]  It was the Asian markets the last couple of days have been plummeting.
[00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:12.093]  We now have dollar and global stocks are falling.
[00:04:12.834 --> 00:04:19.557]  Evidently, because of, everybody is saying it's because of Janet Yellen's comments yesterday that she made in one of the houses of Congress.
[00:04:19.597 --> 00:04:20.797]  She's speaking again today.
[00:04:20.817 --> 00:04:28.780]  You know, the Fed created this economic bubble and the Fed is now waving their pen around and scaring the stock markets.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.961]  Everybody is fleeing to gold.
[00:04:31.041 --> 00:04:33.642]  It's a massive move towards gold.
[00:04:33.662 --> 00:04:36.783]  There's a lot of articles up at the top of Drudge Report.
[00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:40.465]  As a matter of fact, it is the lead story on the Drudge Report gold rush.
[00:04:40.925 --> 00:04:46.629]  As stocks and bonds plunge, and then of course there's a very interesting article we'll take a look at from the Telegraph.
[00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:49.411]  They say the world can't afford another financial crisis.
[00:04:49.491 --> 00:04:51.232]  It could destroy capitalism as we know it.
[00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:55.154]  Well, capitalism as they define it is crony corruption.
[00:04:55.214 --> 00:05:01.178]  Maybe that wouldn't be a bad thing, but of course it will be spun by the Bernie Sanders socialists in a very evil way.
[00:05:01.398 --> 00:05:02.359]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:05:09.724 --> 00:05:12.185]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:05:12.465 --> 00:05:16.708]  Anti-Beyonce rally planned for next week at NFL headquarters.
[00:05:17.068 --> 00:05:21.610]  Controversy continues to swirl around Beyonce's Super Bowl halftime show performance.
[00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.393]  The pop superstar is being accused of using her performance to attack police officers.
[00:05:26.653 --> 00:05:32.937]  Beyonce and her dancers were wearing leather and black berets, which was apparently a nod to the Black Panthers movement.
[00:05:33.137 --> 00:05:43.823]  One dance formation seemed to acknowledge Malcolm X, and other dancers had fists in the air, which was reminiscent of the Black Power salutes of the 1960s and 1970s.
[00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:49.507]  Representative Peter King of New York told CBS2 that the NFL should have canceled her appearance.
[00:05:49.767 --> 00:05:51.728]  I found the entire show objectionable.
[00:05:51.868 --> 00:05:56.090]  Despite the criticism, Beyonce has seen her share of supporters for her performance.
[00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:05.874]  Black Lives Matter activist Malina Abdullah praised her for being like artists who are willing to raise social consciousness and use their artistry to advance social justice.
[00:06:06.014 --> 00:06:09.016]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:09.676 --> 00:06:14.018]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:06:14.298 --> 00:06:18.924]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:06:19.064 --> 00:06:20.085]  Talk about the effects.
[00:06:20.405 --> 00:06:21.887]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:06:21.907 --> 00:06:23.529]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:24.891]  I feel like I look better.
[00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:25.612]  I feel better.
[00:06:25.672 --> 00:06:26.693]  I feel sexier.
[00:06:26.713 --> 00:06:27.454]  I love it.
[00:06:27.694 --> 00:06:30.618]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:06:30.678 --> 00:06:33.361]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:34.622]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:06:34.662 --> 00:06:35.702]  Consult your physician.

[00:06:38.224 --> 00:06:39.165]  This is life-changing.
[00:06:39.685 --> 00:06:40.446]  Shower filters.
[00:06:40.586 --> 00:06:42.227]  We're introducing the best yet.

[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:13.505]  Secret 12, InfoWars Life's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:07:13.765 --> 00:07:19.867]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:07:20.067 --> 00:07:27.050]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:36.200]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:42.407]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:07:42.647 --> 00:07:45.791]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and
[00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:47.372]  Adenosylcobalamin.
[00:07:47.452 --> 00:07:50.814]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:52.655]  No needles, no injections.
[00:07:52.935 --> 00:07:54.416]  Don't take my word for it.

[00:08:03.301 --> 00:08:03.501]  Secret 12.
[00:08:12.466 --> 00:08:15.110]  My fellow liberty lovers, it is February 11th.
[00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.392]  2016 on this worldwide live Thursday transmission.
[00:08:31.372 --> 00:08:34.494]  I am filing reports from the road coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:08:34.594 --> 00:08:36.915]  David Knight will be hosting live in studio.
[00:08:37.635 --> 00:08:53.443]  Now at the bottom of the hour, I'm filing a report on the deteriorating situation out in Oregon with Cliven Bundy traveling there to protest for his son's release, being arrested in Portland last night, flying in in armored vehicles.
[00:08:54.563 --> 00:09:05.212]  The ones they swore wouldn't be used against the American people have now surrounded the Federal Wildlife Refuge and the people inside say that they may finally give up today.
[00:09:05.232 --> 00:09:16.202]  And of course the feds with total relish will then charge them with a bunch of crimes, but allow the president to sign executive orders to basically bring in all the illegal aliens he wants
[00:09:16.502 --> 00:09:17.062]  We're good to go.
[00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:50.437]  The so-called federal government is run by foreign banks on record.
[00:09:50.477 --> 00:09:52.138]  That's what the New World Order is all about.
[00:09:53.739 --> 00:10:00.522]  And they are trying to make, if you quote, federal lands that in some states are 90% of the land, like Nevada, off limits.
[00:10:02.003 --> 00:10:04.044]  They're blocking people with their four-wheelers.
[00:10:04.284 --> 00:10:05.625]  They're blocking people trying to fish.
[00:10:05.965 --> 00:10:12.069]  They're kicking farmers and ranchers off that have used the land before it was even a territory or a state.
[00:10:13.365 --> 00:10:14.486]  So, that's what's going on.
[00:10:14.526 --> 00:10:29.438]  And under property rights, for all the liberal trendies who hate capitalism but love their iPhones, when you have grazing rights and you have a loyal title, that is the strongest type of right you can have when it's been exercised over generations.
[00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:35.664]  That's why they have to grandfather in people that already owned or used the land before.
[00:10:36.024 --> 00:10:37.925]  David Knott was making a great point just two days ago.
[00:10:38.894 --> 00:10:41.398]  They call them nail houses in China.
[00:10:41.418 --> 00:10:42.299]  There's thousands of them.
[00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:46.725]  We're in the middle of a shopping center or the middle of a government complex or the middle of a road.
[00:10:47.026 --> 00:10:50.290]  They'll just be a house in 10 acres.
[00:10:51.874 --> 00:11:02.222]  Because after Mao took over, they couldn't produce any food when they took all the land, so they let the public all have about 10 acres, and most of the country's produce ended up being produced on those little 10 acre plots.
[00:11:02.723 --> 00:11:04.424]  He was copying what Lenin did as well.
[00:11:04.444 --> 00:11:09.949]  The Soviet Union couldn't feed itself in its early days because they collectivized everything.
[00:11:11.073 --> 00:11:20.598]  And so they began to allow some of their satellites that they controlled, like Ukraine and other areas, especially in the time of Stalin, to then have their own little small plots of land.
[00:11:21.158 --> 00:11:24.540]  So I guess capitalism does, again, feed even the Communist bellies.
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.880]  But I digress.
[00:11:26.381 --> 00:11:27.621]  The Feds are out of control.
[00:11:27.661 --> 00:11:28.962]  They're starting fights everywhere.
[00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:29.902]  They're power-grabbing.
[00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:31.563]  They're groping our genitals at the airport.
[00:11:31.883 --> 00:11:32.784]  And the border's open.
[00:11:33.044 --> 00:11:34.145]  It's all a big joke, okay?
[00:11:34.165 --> 00:11:34.625]  We know that.
[00:11:34.845 --> 00:11:35.725]  We've ascertained that.
[00:11:37.286 --> 00:11:38.627]  But the bigger issue is
[00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:44.699]  Globalism uses the same tactics around the world to take over a country.
[00:11:44.739 --> 00:11:51.893]  And when it enters the final phases of a total foreign takeover, they will try to start a domestic civil war in a country.
[00:11:53.368 --> 00:12:01.752]  Ahead of really restricting speech and really arresting your political opposition, which is professors and writers and scientists and media people.
[00:12:02.132 --> 00:12:12.378]  But first they want to set the precedent rounding up people that are seen as disreputable, just like Hitler did with the Jews and others that they demonized.
[00:12:12.978 --> 00:12:18.501]  And so that's why they want to infiltrate and manipulate the patriot media and the patriot militia.
[00:12:19.642 --> 00:12:30.731]  To have us sound violent, to have us sound unhinged so that they can then affect the battle space and try to sell the idea of a war against the American people.
[00:12:30.891 --> 00:12:33.273]  The good news is it's not going to fly.
[00:12:33.473 --> 00:12:34.233]  The dog doesn't hunt.
[00:12:36.696 --> 00:12:37.496]  The boat doesn't float.
[00:12:38.336 --> 00:12:39.977]  Congress has a 9% approval rating.
[00:12:40.277 --> 00:12:46.018]  They had a Gallup poll last month where Americans think the government's the most dangerous thing to them in the world.
[00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:48.799]  And that's true because it's illegitimate.
[00:12:49.219 --> 00:12:51.880]  It's run by these special interests who are playing God.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:13:05.023]  Now coming up, David Knight has a guest coming on the broadcast to break down the fact that major city councils across the country and state legislatures
[00:13:06.249 --> 00:13:15.771]  Are trying to ban the words founding fathers being used at 4th of July or being used in government speech.
[00:13:16.711 --> 00:13:19.351]  They're saying do not talk about the founders in speeches.
[00:13:19.791 --> 00:13:23.612]  Do not talk about the founders when you're giving a speech.
[00:13:23.712 --> 00:13:24.512]  Do not use it.
[00:13:24.872 --> 00:13:27.833]  That's just like when they said in Seattle, ban brown bags.
[00:13:28.133 --> 00:13:29.553]  They might hurt somebody's feelings.
[00:13:29.973 --> 00:13:31.193]  And you're like, that's ridiculous.
[00:13:31.293 --> 00:13:32.454]  It's meant to be ridiculous.
[00:13:32.914 --> 00:13:34.194]  These are thought police.
[00:13:35.376 --> 00:13:38.997]  And they've already banned protesting radical Muslims in Europe.
[00:13:39.337 --> 00:13:41.797]  They have a permanent emergency now in France.
[00:13:43.058 --> 00:13:43.998]  People say that's crazy.
[00:13:44.018 --> 00:13:48.579]  They bring in foreigners, let them attack, and then if you speak out against it, you get arrested.
[00:13:48.659 --> 00:13:48.979]  Yes.
[00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:49.819]  Yes.
[00:13:50.479 --> 00:13:52.900]  That's what they're trying to set up in this country as well.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:58.921]  And so we have to understand these are true authoritarians.
[00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:02.198]  That we are dealing with.
[00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:06.282]  These are true oppressors of the people.
[00:14:07.162 --> 00:14:12.968]  And if you work for the federal government, I mean, give me a break.
[00:14:13.528 --> 00:14:15.870]  Who could deny that it's lawless at the top?
[00:14:16.311 --> 00:14:19.013]  Who could deny it's doing more and more things that aren't in the Constitution?
[00:14:19.333 --> 00:14:23.677]  Who can deny that it's involved in many policies that persecute the people?
[00:14:24.238 --> 00:14:27.441]  Who can deny that when you go to a national park now,
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:35.947]  Imperious, arrogant rangers will just come over and henpeck you to let you know that they're the boss.
[00:14:36.348 --> 00:14:37.649]  Same thing when you're in DC.
[00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:48.500]  Just endless uniformed groups, federal, state, and local, getting in your face, treating you like you're bad, training you that you basically have no dignity or no rights.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.883]  This is all being done by design.
[00:14:52.426 --> 00:15:09.845]  And then when the police and security services, now that we're a third world country, act like goons, the globalists are going to come in in the next phase, which you're already seeing the preparatory stages of, and start a major socialist slash communist style revolt against those departments.
[00:15:10.646 --> 00:15:21.717]  Then the feds will come in as the saviors saying adopt the UN truth and reconciliation model of the quote strong cities initiative.
[00:15:22.057 --> 00:15:23.418]  Let us monitor you.
[00:15:23.479 --> 00:15:24.600]  Let us run you.
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.443]  This is already happening in America and we won't come after you.
[00:15:28.483 --> 00:15:29.665]  We won't indict you.
[00:15:29.945 --> 00:15:31.566]  We won't SWAT team raid you.
[00:15:31.827 --> 00:15:34.549]  We won't sue you like they are Sheriff Arpaio.
[00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:40.932]  And they're investigating people like Governor Abbott and our Attorney General, they've indicted.
[00:15:41.192 --> 00:15:42.972]  There's already a war going on.
[00:15:44.233 --> 00:15:56.197]  And we need to have people like the Governor of Texas be able to stand strong with the people behind them, openly speaking out against the tyranny that we're seeing.
[00:15:56.237 --> 00:16:00.518]  Because the fact that they're bringing in all this open attack on free speech, the
[00:16:01.857 --> 00:16:18.743]  The fact that they're telling us on TV that our kids belong to the government only shows how desperate they are to speed up their revolution of authoritarianism and just make us basically cave in and submit and be so overwhelmed we just give up.
[00:16:18.963 --> 00:16:19.703]  That's not happening.
[00:16:20.083 --> 00:16:21.103]  The opposite is happening.
[00:16:21.143 --> 00:16:22.604]  People are waking up in droves.
[00:16:22.964 --> 00:16:24.424]  They're realizing what's going on.
[00:16:24.985 --> 00:16:25.605]  The feds
[00:16:26.744 --> 00:16:27.865]  Are waking up big time?
[00:16:28.105 --> 00:16:29.346]  Believe me, it's amazing.
[00:16:29.626 --> 00:16:30.687]  The police are awake.
[00:16:31.027 --> 00:16:32.228]  The military is awake.
[00:16:32.708 --> 00:16:35.850]  I don't know one special forces operator.
[00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:40.433]  I don't know one special forces operator, and I know a lot of them.
[00:16:40.874 --> 00:16:41.974]  I know currently serving.
[00:16:42.275 --> 00:16:46.798]  I know folks, Navy SEALs, Green Berets, Delta Force, whole nine yards.
[00:16:47.418 --> 00:16:51.001]  You know, people that have just done amazing stuff beyond anything you've ever seen in a movie.
[00:16:51.321 --> 00:16:52.221]  Super smart men.
[00:16:52.802 --> 00:16:55.264]  And they are as awake as I am or more.
[00:16:56.144 --> 00:16:58.886]  Okay, so that's got to concern the globalist folks.
[00:16:58.926 --> 00:16:59.867]  So what do they want to do?
[00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:01.789]  They want to kick off a civil war.
[00:17:02.089 --> 00:17:06.933]  They want us to act like a bunch of idiots and a bunch of morons, and we can't let that happen.
[00:17:06.973 --> 00:17:14.960]  But we've also got to realize, and I'm going to say this again later because it's so important, we can't be maneuvered into a physical fight.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.504]  And I don't want to hear all these guys that go, shut up, wimp, you know, time for talk's over.
[00:17:21.075 --> 00:17:22.896]  It's those guys that never actually do anything.
[00:17:23.677 --> 00:17:25.058]  Have you gotten politically involved?
[00:17:25.098 --> 00:17:26.098]  Have you run for office?
[00:17:26.118 --> 00:17:27.179]  Have you done a radio show?
[00:17:27.219 --> 00:17:28.140]  Have you done videos?
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.401]  Have you gotten involved?
[00:17:29.421 --> 00:17:31.362]  Have you sued an agency that's out of control?
[00:17:31.722 --> 00:17:36.825]  Have you supported good people in government to hold them up as leaders and promote them?
[00:17:37.886 --> 00:17:40.608]  Have you gone out and created community organizations?
[00:17:43.075 --> 00:17:43.916]  No, you haven't.
[00:17:44.477 --> 00:17:48.882]  But millions and millions of other great patriots in this country and worldwide have.
[00:17:49.202 --> 00:17:57.792]  And you're the reason we have a very, very good shot at stopping this and not letting them start a Soros-style civil war like we've seen in Ukraine.
[00:17:58.032 --> 00:17:59.314]  So I just keep hammering that.
[00:17:59.794 --> 00:18:01.835]  And hammering that, and hammering that.
[00:18:02.235 --> 00:18:06.537]  It is a tragedy that someone was killed out there, Mr. LaVoie.
[00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:10.599]  But it'll be a bigger tragedy if this kicks off in a larger event.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.220]  Again, I'm going to say it.
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.862]  Let's not be maneuvered into fighting with each other.
[00:18:14.882 --> 00:18:17.343]  The info war is now.
[00:18:17.623 --> 00:18:19.364]  You will never physically fight.
[00:18:21.181 --> 00:18:30.548]  In the future, if you won't fight in the information war today, and that's what the globalists are scared of, because 99% of us stand to lose under this new world order.
[00:18:30.888 --> 00:18:36.552]  It's treasonous, it's illegitimate, it's foreign, it's breaking all of our laws nakedly in our face.
[00:18:36.852 --> 00:18:45.358]  It's time to get that message out and have the states come together with the people and with good members of Congress to reverse this tyranny, this runaway train.
[00:18:45.598 --> 00:18:48.861]  Don't think that there's this big runaway train because they're invincible.
[00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:55.023]  They're now in the looting process knowing they may go down and may be defeated and may be set back.
[00:18:55.863 --> 00:19:00.824]  Doesn't mean they'll be completely defeated, but they know they're about to be set back in Europe and the United States and other areas.
[00:19:00.964 --> 00:19:02.184]  That's why they dissolved the borders.
[00:19:02.425 --> 00:19:03.345]  It's why they're panicking.
[00:19:03.525 --> 00:19:08.986]  It's why they're trying to bring us into globalism now, is because there is such a huge awakening taking place.
[00:19:09.366 --> 00:19:11.127]  They are desperate people.
[00:19:11.747 --> 00:19:12.728]  They are desperate.
[00:19:13.128 --> 00:19:28.061]  So we need to hold our heads high, stand up for free speech, and promote free speech, and go to these city councils and these public schools, and let them know that there will be free speech, and reach out with free speech programs to reteach Americana.
[00:19:28.441 --> 00:19:32.665]  That is like high noon to a vampire, or a silver bullet to a werewolf.
[00:19:33.206 --> 00:19:36.749]  They want to get our speech shut down because that's the power, folks.
[00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:39.091]  So use it or lose it.
[00:19:39.771 --> 00:19:41.612]  And now is the time to use it.
[00:19:41.632 --> 00:19:43.854]  We're doing it right here at the InfoWar.
[00:19:43.874 --> 00:19:44.834]  We're going to go to break.
[00:19:45.214 --> 00:19:47.576]  We're going to come back with David Knight and more.
[00:19:47.976 --> 00:19:48.456]  Stay with us.
[00:19:48.516 --> 00:19:54.720]  It's a big broadcast today as we defend the entire Bill of Rights against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.615]  Winter has just begun and are you already tired of being cold?

[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.021]  It's true.
[00:22:14.141 --> 00:22:18.084]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:22:18.304 --> 00:22:20.166]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:22:20.686 --> 00:22:25.170]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:38.079]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.

[00:23:09.204 --> 00:23:12.746]  Attention, listeners of this radio station are set to get free survival food.
[00:23:13.126 --> 00:23:19.669]  Farmers vow to keep up with the rush to supply every listener who calls and beats the deadline to claim free 72-hour survival food kits.
[00:23:19.929 --> 00:23:23.170]  In a crisis, your number one need is food, but not just any food.
[00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:26.572]  Experts recommend good-for-25-years survival food.
[00:23:26.892 --> 00:23:33.915]  In an unprecedented move, Food for Patriots 72-hour survival food kits are being given away to listeners of this radio station.
[00:23:34.375 --> 00:23:39.538]  According to a company spokesman, this is happening because we're worried that the people in Washington have an agenda.
[00:23:39.758 --> 00:23:41.439]  Control the food, control the people.
[00:23:41.759 --> 00:23:45.000]  You don't want to rely on the government to keep your family fed in a crisis.
[00:23:45.321 --> 00:23:50.423]  The normal price of these kits is $27 plus shipping, but listeners who act now get them free.
[00:23:50.643 --> 00:23:53.465]  Just cover $9.95 shipping and processing per kit.
[00:23:53.725 --> 00:23:55.766]  Call 800-942-7579 in the next 48 hours to beat the deadline.

[00:24:02.131 --> 00:24:02.371]  That's 800-942-7579.
[00:24:16.351 --> 00:24:19.992]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:20.032 --> 00:24:21.253]  I'm David Knight here live.
[00:24:21.273 --> 00:24:24.554]  We're going to have some more comments from Alex Jones in the next segment.
[00:24:25.154 --> 00:24:32.737]  I want to talk about who the real terrorists are as we look at the situation unfolding in Oregon and of course we're staying abreast of what's going on there.
[00:24:32.757 --> 00:24:34.178]  We've had Franklin Graham
[00:24:34.918 --> 00:24:39.865]  Fly to the area to try to resolve this peacefully so there won't be any more loss of life.
[00:24:40.626 --> 00:24:42.388]  We hope that it is resolved peacefully.
[00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:47.495]  Before I go to who the real terrorists are, let me tell you about a new flash sale that we have 24 hours.
[00:24:47.515 --> 00:24:47.776]  We have a
[00:24:50.459 --> 00:24:56.006]  A flash sale 30 to 40 percent off retail for our InfoWars Life select storable food.
[00:24:56.186 --> 00:24:58.930]  This is very important as we look at the economic uncertainty.
[00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:00.832]  As you look at the drudge report still at the very top.
[00:25:01.212 --> 00:25:03.255]  Gold rush, the stocks, bonds, plunge.
[00:25:03.295 --> 00:25:08.441]  We're headed for very uncertain economic times as we're approaching this year.
[00:25:09.002 --> 00:25:09.682]  We're good to go.
[00:25:30.769 --> 00:25:32.632]  On any orders over $50.
[00:25:32.732 --> 00:25:40.744]  That's very important because food is heavy to ship so that's a big savings in addition to the 30 to 40 percent off retail.
[00:25:41.638 --> 00:25:44.520]  So for limited time only, we've got this 24-hour flash sale.
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.781]  You can get 30 to 40% off InfoWars Select Food.
[00:25:46.801 --> 00:25:51.545]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:25:51.725 --> 00:25:57.028]  And one other thing, we have extended for one more day the introductory sale for AnthroPlex.
[00:25:57.088 --> 00:26:03.092]  Again, that's the sale where you can get AnthroPlex, our new male product, along with Super Male Vitality.
[00:26:03.112 --> 00:26:07.075]  15% off when you buy those together and get free shipping.
[00:26:07.155 --> 00:26:08.476]  This will end today.
[00:26:08.516 --> 00:26:09.937]  We extended it for one more day.
[00:26:09.957 --> 00:26:11.578]  You can find that at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:26:12.118 --> 00:26:17.463]  There was an article that caught my attention today as I was looking at what's going on in Oregon.
[00:26:17.483 --> 00:26:23.749]  HSBC has just been sued in Texas court for acts of terror.
[00:26:23.969 --> 00:26:35.140]  Yes, the London Bank, Hong Kong-Shanghai Bank, and of course remember they got started about a hundred years ago with the opium trade out of Hong Kong-Shanghai.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.020]  U.S.
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.322]  families, the families of U.S.
[00:26:38.362 --> 00:26:42.524]  citizens who were brutally murdered by Mexican drug cartels are suing HSBC.
[00:26:42.904 --> 00:26:48.708]  They're accusing the bank of allowing crime lords to launder billions of dollars and shatter lives in the process.
[00:26:48.748 --> 00:26:50.208]  This is from RT.
[00:26:50.849 --> 00:26:59.674]  Through Reuters, they say the legal complaint says HSBC's material support of Mexican drug gangs led to the destruction of multiple lives, including those of the plaintiffs.
[00:26:59.714 --> 00:27:01.195]  And of course, we have reported
[00:27:01.795 --> 00:27:04.761]  They found HSBC liable for money laundering.
[00:27:04.801 --> 00:27:08.709]  They gave them a slap on the wrist, which was two billion dollars in penalties back in 2012.
[00:27:08.749 --> 00:27:09.410]  We've talked to...
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:18.225]  A whistleblower who pointed out that this kind of activity had been flagged before it continued to go on.
[00:27:18.786 --> 00:27:19.406]  Yeah, what do we hear?
[00:27:19.466 --> 00:27:20.867]  We hear about Yale-Qaeda.
[00:27:21.107 --> 00:27:23.850]  We hear about these guys who are protesting in Oregon.
[00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:27.513]  And again, I think that the way they went about it was foolish.
[00:27:27.553 --> 00:27:29.594]  They should have stuck to their area.
[00:27:29.654 --> 00:27:34.038]  They should have had the backing and the understanding of their community where they were known.
[00:27:34.798 --> 00:27:37.280]  But they didn't break any laws.
[00:27:38.049 --> 00:27:40.590]  They're being charged with conspiracy.
[00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:42.250]  That's the favorite thing of the FBI.
[00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:51.873]  You know, when I look at what the FBI, what the BLM did in Nevada, cordoning off that area and saying this is a free speech zone, that was really an affront.
[00:27:51.913 --> 00:27:52.773]  It was a visual thing.
[00:27:52.833 --> 00:27:53.534]  People could get around.
[00:27:53.574 --> 00:27:56.154]  But you have to understand and look at what the FBI is doing.
[00:27:56.194 --> 00:28:04.417]  When they arrest these people, when they make it into, when they actually killed LaVoy Finnegan, now they've arrested Cliven Bundy for flying up there.
[00:28:05.057 --> 00:28:09.080]  Can't we address and redress grievances to our government?
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.961]  Can't we complain to their face?
[00:28:11.281 --> 00:28:13.523]  Can't we carry weapons openly?
[00:28:13.543 --> 00:28:20.128]  It didn't violate any state laws, and certainly it's supported by the Second Amendment, without getting attacked by the FBI.
[00:28:20.208 --> 00:28:23.830]  Remember, the only people who have done violence here have been the FBI.
[00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:25.131]  There was no violence done.
[00:28:25.351 --> 00:28:34.358]  These people who were arrested, Lavoie Finnegan who was shot, they were on their way to a meeting with 400 people to talk about natural resources issues in that area.
[00:28:34.958 --> 00:28:38.803]  And when we look at the other terrorists, we see HSBC laundering money.
[00:28:39.443 --> 00:28:40.625]  Remember El Chapo?
[00:28:41.005 --> 00:28:44.029]  The guy that we heard so much about when he broke out of the prison.
[00:28:44.489 --> 00:28:45.951]  He was head of the Sinaloa cartel.
[00:28:46.906 --> 00:28:52.952]  That Sinaloa cartel had its own private window at HSBC to launder money.
[00:28:53.733 --> 00:29:02.182]  So these people are working with the Mexican drug gangs, are working with international gangs, are working with terrorists to foment violence.
[00:29:02.342 --> 00:29:07.527]  This is the banks, this is the government, and the government gives them a pass because they're too big to jail.
[00:29:08.288 --> 00:29:10.210]  That's what we really need to be concerned about.
[00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:13.073]  Those are the people who are the real terrorists.
[00:29:13.614 --> 00:29:27.167]  And let me tell you, as we look at these stories that are at the top of drudge about the markets that are collapsing now, people are stampeding out of the global stock markets concerned about the comments that the chair of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, is saying.
[00:29:28.379 --> 00:29:33.343]  Remember that it was Ben Bernanke who said, yeah, we caused the depression.
[00:29:33.363 --> 00:29:34.244]  Sorry about that.
[00:29:34.784 --> 00:29:35.345]  Sorry about that.
[00:29:35.765 --> 00:29:39.568]  We, in other words, the Fed, he said it as he was chairman of the Fed, we won't do that again.
[00:29:39.588 --> 00:29:40.469]  Oh, really?
[00:29:40.949 --> 00:29:41.190]  Really?
[00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:45.913]  When we look at this, I don't have a lot of confidence that they won't do it again.
[00:29:46.714 --> 00:29:48.376]  So we're going to be right back with Alex Jones.
[00:29:48.416 --> 00:29:51.438]  He has more comments about what is going on in Oregon.
[00:29:51.458 --> 00:29:52.359]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:58.993 --> 00:30:01.982]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.904 --> 00:30:05.592]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:14.413]  Leftist media labels Trump supporters racist, sexist zombies after New Hampshire win.
[00:30:14.573 --> 00:30:17.194]  Victriolic headlines highlight unhinged sentiment.
[00:30:17.294 --> 00:30:19.195]  Article up by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:30:19.335 --> 00:30:23.498]  Trump trouts nearest contender John Kasich, taking 34% of the vote.
[00:30:23.538 --> 00:30:27.720]  With establishment favor Marco Rubio lagging behind in fifth place.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.542]  The Huffington Post exploded with resentment.
[00:30:30.682 --> 00:30:36.185]  Running the headline, New Hampshire goes racist, sexist, homophobic, in huge red capital letters.
[00:30:36.405 --> 00:30:40.209]  A short time later, the headline was changed to WTF GOP.
[00:30:40.349 --> 00:30:44.874]  This is just the latest salvo in the publication's long-running feud with Trump.
[00:30:44.954 --> 00:30:49.478]  It had previously relegated news stories about him to the entertainment section.
[00:30:49.639 --> 00:30:59.308]  Last month, The Huffington Post took the unprecedented step of adding a note to the bottom of every article about Trump which described him as a liar, a racist, and a xenophobe.
[00:31:00.189 --> 00:31:06.056]  Not to be outdone, the New York Daily News reacted to Trump's win by portraying the business mogul as a clown.
[00:31:06.137 --> 00:31:09.341]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:11.873 --> 00:31:15.237]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:31:15.597 --> 00:31:24.406]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war as the enemy approached, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:31:25.027 --> 00:31:33.356]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:31:33.716 --> 00:31:37.840]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:47.449]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:31:47.869 --> 00:31:53.254]  I personally counter this onslaught with Entroplex, the latest product from Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:53.534 --> 00:31:56.357]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.

[00:32:14.271 --> 00:32:18.232]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[00:32:39.617 --> 00:32:40.558]  BrainForce is here.
[00:32:40.758 --> 00:32:42.839]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:32:42.959 --> 00:32:47.702]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:32:47.942 --> 00:32:49.603]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[00:32:49.643 --> 00:32:51.104]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:32:51.244 --> 00:32:54.446]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:32:54.726 --> 00:32:56.527]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:32:56.707 --> 00:32:57.608]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:32:57.628 --> 00:32:58.569]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:32:58.809 --> 00:33:00.690]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:06.413]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:33:10.285 --> 00:33:14.167]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:15.828 --> 00:33:18.509]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:31.116]  Alex Jones here with a breakdown on the latest developments in Oregon with the ongoing standoff and the entire land rights situation.
[00:33:31.996 --> 00:33:39.240]  This is very, very important, and I know that everything we talk about here on the broadcast is important, but this is particularly important because
[00:33:40.805 --> 00:33:43.688]  It's got so many different angles to it.
[00:33:44.508 --> 00:34:01.664]  First off, there's four people still inside, and they're saying that they're negotiating to come out today because the FBI has moved armored vehicles, MRAPs in, surrounding it within about 50 yards, and has snipers trained on the building, reportedly.
[00:34:02.985 --> 00:34:05.787]  And so they're now realizing that things are escalating.
[00:34:06.693 --> 00:34:24.648]  That coincides with the patriarch of the Bundy clan being arrested, the 74-year-old rancher being arrested, flying into Oregon last night.
[00:34:25.789 --> 00:34:30.493]  Now, going over the different things that Cliven had talked about,
[00:34:31.809 --> 00:34:35.191]  His sons, after they were in custody, said, stand down, everybody go home.
[00:34:35.812 --> 00:34:47.899]  He had put the sheriff on notice basically ordering him to remove the feds and saying that he was coming out there to basically lead a new protest of some type.
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.641]  So Mr. Bundy had to know that the feds
[00:34:53.726 --> 00:35:00.509]  See him as more of a leader than his sons and would obviously be planning to arrest him when he arrives.
[00:35:00.549 --> 00:35:12.455]  So we must take into consideration the fact that he probably knows that this was going to happen and wants to be a symbol, a land rights symbol, and I guess be in jail with his sons.
[00:35:13.776 --> 00:35:14.256]  Let's be clear.
[00:35:15.822 --> 00:35:19.684]  We sent out David Knight and Josh Owens and covered this for over a week.
[00:35:19.785 --> 00:35:27.269]  When it happened last year, we were right there when the Feds were threatening to shoot the people if they crossed the line there in Southern Nevada.
[00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:29.491]  It was historic.
[00:35:30.151 --> 00:35:33.233]  And that's why Harry Reid said, these people are domestic terrorists.
[00:35:33.273 --> 00:35:33.933]  We're going to get you.
[00:35:33.973 --> 00:35:34.854]  We're coming after you.
[00:35:36.075 --> 00:35:43.680]  From that point on, the Feds had special psychological warfare operators infiltrating
[00:35:44.853 --> 00:36:00.325]  Kind of the Bundy Circle and basically maneuvering them from the best research we've been able to put together into this new situation and the 40-day standoff.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:01.840]  In Oregon.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:03.461]  Now, let's be clear.
[00:36:04.181 --> 00:36:05.321]  The Feds are out of control.
[00:36:05.961 --> 00:36:06.962]  They're totally lawless.
[00:36:07.722 --> 00:36:09.603]  The President ignores whatever laws he wants.
[00:36:09.643 --> 00:36:12.824]  They ship in plane loads of people every day and don't even check their IDs.
[00:36:12.864 --> 00:36:14.584]  That's mainstream news.
[00:36:14.704 --> 00:36:17.325]  The government has been caught shipping in most of the narcotics.
[00:36:17.345 --> 00:36:18.485]  The big banks launder the money.
[00:36:19.045 --> 00:36:20.906]  They put cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:36:21.586 --> 00:36:24.047]  Look, we know we have an occupied government.
[00:36:24.307 --> 00:36:26.688]  We know that it's been taken over by foreign interests.
[00:36:26.728 --> 00:36:30.229]  We know it signs foreign secret treaties waiving our sovereignty.
[00:36:31.789 --> 00:36:43.377]  The problem is, if you look at the George Soros globalist attack plan, they don't want us to peacefully, politically educate people about this, and then take the country back through the states and the federal government, and a CON-CON if needed.
[00:36:44.338 --> 00:36:45.178]  Constitutional Convention.
[00:36:45.679 --> 00:36:54.605]  They want it to be a physical confrontation, and where they can do it on their terms, where they want, with people that have martyr complexes.
[00:36:55.626 --> 00:37:09.411]  And I've studied the situation, I've studied the militias in this country, and what they do is they go out and they find the militias, or they find the type of people that mean well, but who can be psychologically manipulated into believing they're going to make a last stand like the Alamo.
[00:37:11.312 --> 00:37:21.196]  And then once they have the people in place, they can then have other operatives come in, or useful idiots, and do things like dress up in sumo wrestler outfits or
[00:37:22.711 --> 00:37:30.455]  You know, when the liberal media would send giant boxes of sex toys, they would, you know, hold them up on TV and say, how dare you send these to us?
[00:37:31.455 --> 00:37:33.536]  Just everything they did walked right into a trap.
[00:37:34.676 --> 00:37:36.577]  And not so much the Bundys, but the other people there.
[00:37:37.558 --> 00:37:40.499]  Then, of course, you've got the fact that the Hammonds said, we don't want you here.
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.761]  You know, we don't want to have this standoff.
[00:37:44.421 --> 00:37:46.642]  They were clearly set up over a control burn.
[00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:52.471]  This is giving Harry Reid everything he wants.
[00:37:53.672 --> 00:38:07.218]  Because you have the iconography, the image of what happened last year with people with American flags on horseback not aiming their guns at the feds and the feds aiming their guns at the people and they look like fools.
[00:38:07.638 --> 00:38:13.441]  They look like an occupying army being run off by the local villagers, the local peasants.
[00:38:14.081 --> 00:38:15.282]  And so the symbolism
[00:38:16.684 --> 00:38:41.181]  Was pure Americana, pure John Wayne, and absolutely scared the living daylights out of the globalists because they want to make resistance to tyranny, whether it be physical or whether it be cultural, informational, they want to make it look like guys hiding out in camo thinking that the government's going to put chips in their brains.
[00:38:41.701 --> 00:38:45.223]  They want to make it look paranoid and schizophrenic and nuts.
[00:38:46.263 --> 00:38:57.089]  And they want to sell that image to brand any resistance to what's coming as farcical, as stupid, as silly.
[00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:05.854]  And that's exactly what, then, a year plus later, the Bundys walked into.
[00:39:07.654 --> 00:39:13.958]  In the case of the Bundy Ranch, since the 1870s, they had grazing rights on the property.
[00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:17.914]  And the Feds kept raising the rates until...
[00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:22.732]  More than 50 families total, 30 families right in the area were driven out.
[00:39:23.273 --> 00:39:26.254]  So this is taxation while representation.
[00:39:26.995 --> 00:39:29.216]  This is the power to tax, this is the power to destroy.
[00:39:29.677 --> 00:39:44.205]  Just like they turn off our power plants, just like they set up tariffs and other systems with environmental regulations that are internal tariffs so we can't compete with Chinese and Indian and Mexican factories.
[00:39:44.506 --> 00:39:47.868]  This is all part of the deindustrialization program and getting us off the land.
[00:39:49.062 --> 00:39:50.523]  It is Agenda 21.
[00:39:50.623 --> 00:39:51.824]  It is the UN Treaty.
[00:39:51.924 --> 00:39:57.307]  It is the plan that's been used in Mexico and Burma and in countries in Africa.
[00:39:57.828 --> 00:40:04.632]  This is an exact program that has been used to drive the Native peoples off their lands.
[00:40:05.412 --> 00:40:14.338]  And the Native Americans are pointing out, hey, this is our land you stole to begin with and now you've got a bunch of white people in here fighting over whose it is.
[00:40:15.014 --> 00:40:42.397]  Well, that's a good point, because if you look at the armored vehicles and the BLM arming to the teeth, and all these agencies getting armed, and all these agencies demonizing the Liberty Movement, they're branding it now all over the country, people that try to stay in rural areas and be self-sufficient, whether you be Native American, white, black, whatever you are, to where you are basically seen as a terrorist, and where you are seen as an enemy, and where the sheriff's departments admit, we have these armored vehicles for the constitutional movement.
[00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:48.274]  And then they walk the constitutional movement right into their trap in their place and their time.
[00:40:49.636 --> 00:40:51.577]  So there is a move to push us off the land.
[00:40:51.618 --> 00:40:55.962]  There is a move to use drones against a family in North Dakota.
[00:40:57.082 --> 00:41:04.166]  Who kept having cattle come on their property so they rounded a few of them up and then they called it cattle poaching and sent in Homeland Security with a drone.
[00:41:04.446 --> 00:41:04.806]  Remember that?
[00:41:05.606 --> 00:41:08.068]  So there is a move to pick a fight with rural communities.
[00:41:08.408 --> 00:41:14.591]  There is a move to hire imperious, arrogant, hateful land management groups.
[00:41:16.263 --> 00:41:25.225]  To then basically force locals to choose a side, whether you're with the Feds, who themselves are globalists, or whether you're, quote, with the locals, and quote, the militia.
[00:41:25.785 --> 00:41:38.488]  And then half the time, the so-called militia itself is led or infiltrated by globalist operatives, who then be sure that they can lead the militias internally to make them look stupid.
[00:41:39.753 --> 00:41:40.693]  Sound unreasonable.
[00:41:41.334 --> 00:41:51.058]  And by the way, folks, I interviewed State Knife, the top British commando who was inside the IRA actually running it.
[00:41:53.099 --> 00:41:53.399]  Okay.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.461]  In fact, I've interviewed four of those commandos.
[00:41:57.161 --> 00:42:00.743]  Two of them died within a month of being on my show.
[00:42:01.263 --> 00:42:03.084]  Look up the interviews from eight, nine years ago.
[00:42:04.714 --> 00:42:24.232]  And it has been declassified that since the 70s, the IRA, the Irish Republican Army, to make Sinn Féin and more reasonable groups look radical, led the IRA carrying out bombings against civilian targets.
[00:42:24.292 --> 00:42:28.395]  There was a real IRA that had guns that would fight the British troops.
[00:42:29.787 --> 00:42:38.471]  But another IRA was formed, basically, and even the IRA didn't know that it was British government-run.
[00:42:38.491 --> 00:42:40.051]  Alright?
[00:42:41.492 --> 00:42:48.655]  And they would break the kneecaps and even kill people under them if they wouldn't carry out bombings or if they wouldn't carry out shootings.
[00:42:49.675 --> 00:42:51.436]  And this has all come out of the British papers, okay?
[00:42:51.476 --> 00:42:56.438]  So, that same management system is going on here, where they want to lead the militia movement
[00:42:57.645 --> 00:43:12.479]  When the globalists do horrible things in America, kill farmers, kill ranchers, take property, you name it, they want to lead these movements to make them look unreasonable.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:20.167]  Now again, what the fed-run militias do every time I point this out is they go, you shut up, you're a fed, we're not feds, you said we're feds.
[00:43:20.547 --> 00:43:22.049]  I'm not saying you're feds.
[00:43:23.402 --> 00:43:29.524]  I'm saying the globalists, foundation operatives above the feds, are infiltrating and leading groups.
[00:43:29.584 --> 00:43:30.965]  It's been in the news hundreds of times.
[00:43:31.365 --> 00:43:33.345]  Okay, I told you Hal Turner was a fed.
[00:43:33.906 --> 00:43:35.126]  He was attacking me constantly.
[00:43:35.146 --> 00:43:38.687]  And then it turned out he was a high-level fed, national security level FBI.
[00:43:38.907 --> 00:43:42.489]  They still burned him and put him in prison once hackers got into his information.
[00:43:42.509 --> 00:43:44.369]  So that's another message to you snitches.
[00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:49.791]  Your bosses will hang you out to dry because you know where the bodies are buried and they want to discredit you down the road.
[00:43:50.851 --> 00:43:51.912]  So that's key to understand.
[00:43:53.379 --> 00:43:56.642]  And I'm basically just trying to cover all the points of the compass here.
[00:43:57.883 --> 00:44:06.970]  We had a big victory in that the Feds did the right thing and didn't shoot those folks when they came across the line at the whole Bundy Ranch situation.
[00:44:07.191 --> 00:44:10.533]  That could have been an absolute New Waco disastrous fiasco.
[00:44:11.534 --> 00:44:20.362]  And it would have been the shot heard around the world, the image of people with American flags on the back of horses being shot off by Feds in goon outfits.
[00:44:21.854 --> 00:44:23.655]  That's why the Feds didn't pull the trigger that day.
[00:44:24.455 --> 00:44:43.141]  They want to have the Civil War start when they want it to start, so the American people are all fighting with each other, while the globalists control us and manipulate both sides, just like they've done in Ukraine, just like they've done in Syria, just like they've done in Northern Ireland, and Ireland itself, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:44:44.941 --> 00:44:46.942]  So, that's what this comes down to.
[00:44:47.382 --> 00:44:49.683]  And you're facing 21st century warfare here.
[00:44:50.762 --> 00:44:54.543]  The main reason I'm going over all this as well is a lot of the feds don't even know how this works.
[00:44:55.203 --> 00:45:06.426]  The stuff I'm getting into here has taken decades of deep research, decades of interviewing world experts, and decades of going through it myself with these people trying to set us up.
[00:45:07.526 --> 00:45:19.529]  I was reading about Clyde and Bundy six, seven days ago before he traveled to Oregon and got arrested and the press was trying to call him and his daughter got on the phone and said he doesn't talk to anyone but militia.
[00:45:20.555 --> 00:45:24.159]  That's the first thing the feds get you to do is stop talking to the media.
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:27.523]  Only talk to the militia commander.
[00:45:28.004 --> 00:45:30.887]  Only talk to the militia director of communications.
[00:45:31.688 --> 00:45:33.690]  You know, only talk to your bodyguard.
[00:45:34.752 --> 00:45:38.136]  And this is how they get in and manage everybody with paranoia.
[00:45:40.469 --> 00:45:43.630]  They know where you're going, what you're doing, what's being planned.
[00:45:44.411 --> 00:45:57.657]  It's also possible that the four people left inside, one or more, may actually be an operative and may be leading the group and one of the standoff to go a little bit longer so they could demonstrate why they need the armored vehicles and the rest of it.
[00:45:57.957 --> 00:46:05.641]  I'm not saying that, but historically that's one of the things that we see happen and take place.
[00:46:05.881 --> 00:46:08.322]  So this whole thing is a giant trap.
[00:46:09.411 --> 00:46:10.552]  The whole thing is flypaper.
[00:46:12.073 --> 00:46:15.736]  The whole thing is shut up to make land rights activists look stupid.
[00:46:16.777 --> 00:46:20.961]  And the Bundys mean well, but they walked right into a trap.
[00:46:22.462 --> 00:46:25.145]  But remember, even Fox News supported the Bundys.
[00:46:26.085 --> 00:46:26.686]  And people like
[00:46:28.635 --> 00:46:33.117]  Hannity and others, because folks are mad about the land being taken in this country.
[00:46:33.578 --> 00:46:35.579]  People are concerned about what's happening.
[00:46:36.179 --> 00:46:40.341]  They're aware of the persecution that's taking place, and they're really ready for a fight.
[00:46:40.901 --> 00:46:46.024]  So, see, if Fox News sits there and attacks land rights groups, they know they'll lose their audience.
[00:46:46.784 --> 00:46:53.588]  So first, there has to be an internal takeover of the land rights movement, and then an internal demonization campaign.
[00:46:54.617 --> 00:47:05.726]  In the country, so they can then kick off the next phase of incrementally persecuting people that try to go out west or that try to go to rural areas and you left alone.
[00:47:06.807 --> 00:47:14.293]  That way it's also a new market for the defense contractors for their armored vehicles, their drones, their surveillance out west and turn that into the new economy.
[00:47:15.458 --> 00:47:18.340]  Because they are planning massive, massive persecution.
[00:47:18.961 --> 00:47:33.092]  The answer for all these militias and people is to put on a suit and tie, to run for office, to become local commissioners, and then to have community shooting clubs.
[00:47:34.639 --> 00:47:47.026]  Where you invite out the Rotary Club and everybody else, and then you have marksman contests with, you know, $1,000 prizes from the local car dealership or the local gun shop, and you're mainstream.
[00:47:47.347 --> 00:47:50.769]  By mainstream, you take underground, liberty-based systems.
[00:47:52.689 --> 00:47:56.391]  And you then put it out mainstream because that's what Americana is.
[00:47:56.771 --> 00:47:58.612]  And you don't do it hiding in the woods.
[00:47:59.132 --> 00:48:01.053]  You don't do it being led by the feds.
[00:48:01.413 --> 00:48:02.793]  You don't do it in paranoia.
[00:48:02.873 --> 00:48:06.275]  You do it out in the shining sunlight in the open.
[00:48:07.235 --> 00:48:08.856]  We get legislatures elected.
[00:48:09.336 --> 00:48:10.556]  We get governors elected.
[00:48:10.937 --> 00:48:12.417]  We get congresspeople elected.
[00:48:12.477 --> 00:48:19.280]  And we point out there has been a literal foreign globalist takeover in this country.
[00:48:21.027 --> 00:48:23.288]  So I'm very, very sad for the Bundys.
[00:48:23.988 --> 00:48:26.609]  This whole thing is just a disaster.
[00:48:26.629 --> 00:48:33.672]  It has reversed the victory on making land rights activists look good and strong and pure.
[00:48:34.233 --> 00:48:37.714]  It has reversed that and caused a problem.
[00:48:37.754 --> 00:48:42.096]  But overall, I thank God that only one person's died.
[00:48:42.316 --> 00:48:44.597]  And I obviously wish he wouldn't have been killed.
[00:48:46.698 --> 00:48:51.101]  Mr. Lavoie, but this isn't the time or place for a physical fight.
[00:48:51.421 --> 00:48:52.882]  We're winning the info war.
[00:48:53.842 --> 00:48:55.603]  90% of war is informational.
[00:48:56.023 --> 00:48:59.606]  We have the moral high ground and we have a right to defend ourselves.
[00:49:00.806 --> 00:49:05.169]  But being maneuvered into occupations and things like that is not a good idea of a lone building.
[00:49:06.246 --> 00:49:16.299]  You're talking about hundreds of thousands of acres that people have surface rights to, grazing rights to, being stolen by them raising fines and fees designed to kick us off the land.
[00:49:16.779 --> 00:49:17.941]  That was the moral high ground.
[00:49:18.682 --> 00:49:20.864]  Still incredibly dangerous.
[00:49:22.119 --> 00:49:23.060]  So that's the basics.
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:26.744]  I'm going to throw the transmission back to David Knight and the crew there.
[00:49:26.764 --> 00:49:29.727]  I'm going to be filing some other reports throughout the day.
[00:49:29.767 --> 00:49:35.072]  And Lord willing, I'll be back in studio live for the full three, four hours tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[00:49:35.553 --> 00:49:36.954]  Central Standard Time.
[00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:45.183]  I know David and I will have some more points to add to this, but now two sons and the father are in jail.
[00:49:46.162 --> 00:49:52.047]  They're in Oregon and are facing different conspiracy charges to impede federal officers and the rest of it.
[00:49:52.087 --> 00:49:54.449]  And again, the feds are illegitimate.
[00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:58.192]  But the general public doesn't understand that they've been occupied and taken over.
[00:49:58.212 --> 00:50:00.774]  They don't understand that it's completely lawless.
[00:50:01.755 --> 00:50:08.120]  And at the same time, the average federal person themselves is not our enemy and is compartmentalized as well.
[00:50:08.961 --> 00:50:13.565]  And if you won't fight now in the information war, you'll never fight physically
[00:50:15.049 --> 00:50:15.810]  In a physical war.
[00:50:16.271 --> 00:50:19.295]  Because if we can do a physical war, it means we've lost the info war.
[00:50:20.337 --> 00:50:22.420]  And it means that the globalists are getting what they want.
[00:50:23.141 --> 00:50:24.623]  I sincerely pray for peace.
[00:50:25.544 --> 00:50:26.245]  I do prepare.
[00:50:27.383 --> 00:50:27.783]  For sure.
[00:50:47.917 --> 00:50:49.419]  We're good to go.

[00:54:19.087 --> 00:54:19.628]  I'm David Knight.
[00:54:19.668 --> 00:54:23.330]  We're going to be talking to Joe Biggs in the next hour.
[00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:27.693]  We're going to keep up with what's happening at the Oregon standoff as things develop there.
[00:54:28.313 --> 00:54:30.055]  Franklin Graham has flown in.
[00:54:30.115 --> 00:54:33.397]  He's there with a state rep from Nevada, Michelle Fiore.
[00:54:33.797 --> 00:54:39.141]  They are trying to negotiate this out peacefully, trying to get these last four people out without being killed.
[00:54:39.721 --> 00:54:45.165]  But of course, as Cliven Bundy goes in, the FBI immediately arrests him as he gets off the plane.
[00:54:46.383 --> 00:54:48.827]  Almost looks like they don't want to resolve this peacefully.
[00:54:48.847 --> 00:54:56.138]  It looks like they want to fuel the fear and paranoia of the people who remain in the reserve.
[00:54:56.198 --> 00:54:57.300]  So we'll see what happens.
[00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:59.944]  We're going to, as I said, talk to Joe Biggs.
[00:54:59.964 --> 00:55:01.066]  He's been monitoring this.
[00:55:01.906 --> 00:55:05.170]  We see financial markets collapsing around the world.
[00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:06.972]  This is the top of the Drudge Report.
[00:55:07.032 --> 00:55:12.018]  All this morning has been about gold surging to a one-year high on fears of financial uncertainty.
[00:55:12.579 --> 00:55:15.482]  It has jumped 3.6% today.
[00:55:15.502 --> 00:55:18.766]  It's on track for its biggest daily rise since December 1st, 2014.
[00:55:21.269 --> 00:55:28.853]  And, of course, at the same time, and because of that, the tumbling global stocks as well as the falling dollar.
[00:55:28.893 --> 00:55:31.434]  The dollar hit a 16-month low against the yen on Thursday.
[00:55:31.855 --> 00:55:36.137]  Investors were spooked by what Janet Yellen told Congress.
[00:55:36.257 --> 00:55:40.379]  And, of course, she's panicking the markets, talking about interest rates.
[00:55:40.519 --> 00:55:44.301]  Sweden has cut interest rates deeper into negative territory.
[00:55:44.701 --> 00:55:46.142]  This is the central bank of Sweden.
[00:55:46.582 --> 00:55:52.987]  Has now lowered its key interest rate even further below zero, said it is prepared to use its full toolbox of measures.
[00:55:53.007 --> 00:56:00.873]  That would be all the Keynesian tricks, which have not really worked so far, but are going to keep doing the same thing over and over again.
[00:56:00.913 --> 00:56:02.774]  Isn't that definition of insanity here?
[00:56:03.415 --> 00:56:12.281]  Swedish policymakers have unleashed unprecedented stimulus over the past year to save the economy from deflation and keep the krona from appreciating.
[00:56:12.362 --> 00:56:13.943]  So with all of this happening,
[00:56:14.895 --> 00:56:24.162]  We have other people who are looking at this and saying this could be the end of capitalism as we know it with another financial crash.
[00:56:24.222 --> 00:56:25.543]  That's the Daily Telegraph.
[00:56:26.464 --> 00:56:30.828]  They're looking at it and saying we are too fragile fiscally as well as psychologically.
[00:56:30.888 --> 00:56:32.989]  That's what the UK Telegraph says.
[00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:41.076]  Another collapse accompanied by a fresh banking bailout by the taxpayers would trigger a cataclysmic uncontrollable backlash.
[00:56:41.556 --> 00:56:47.940]  Look, let's understand that if we're going to have another bailout, this is not capitalism, folks.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:52.082]  This is just corporate corruption of our government.
[00:56:52.602 --> 00:56:55.444]  If you get bailed out like that, that is not capitalism.
[00:56:55.484 --> 00:56:57.165]  Capitalism has not failed.
[00:56:57.625 --> 00:56:59.346]  Capitalism has not been tried.
[00:56:59.586 --> 00:57:02.207]  And let me say something to all the socialists out there.
[00:57:02.688 --> 00:57:04.569]  All the crony socialists, okay?
[00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:10.031]  Let me give you an example of crony socialism right out of the New Hampshire election.
[00:57:10.071 --> 00:57:11.492]  We talked about this multiple times.
[00:57:12.052 --> 00:57:15.094]  Bernie Sanders got the same number of delegates as Hillary Clinton, right?
[00:57:15.114 --> 00:57:15.674]  He got about 150,000 votes.
[00:57:15.694 --> 00:57:16.335]  He got 15 delegates.
[00:57:16.355 --> 00:57:18.436]  So that's 10,000 voters get him one delegate.
[00:57:23.237 --> 00:57:28.682]  Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, has one party apparatchik that can do whatever she wants.
[00:57:28.702 --> 00:57:33.127]  So one of the socialist party apparatchiks equals 10,000 voters.
[00:57:33.527 --> 00:57:35.149]  How's that for socialism?
[00:57:35.189 --> 00:57:36.570]  How's that for crony socialism?
[00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:40.134]  You know, some socialists are more equal than other socialists.
[00:57:40.154 --> 00:57:44.959]  Maybe you need to put down your catcher in the rye and start looking at Animal Farm.
[00:57:45.239 --> 00:57:55.511]  Now, while all this economic collapse is happening around us, as people are saying, this is the end of capitalism, and it may be a rough ride this year, the stock market, the financial markets have been going down.
[00:57:55.851 --> 00:57:57.092]  Understand, you need to prepare.
[00:57:57.113 --> 00:57:58.935]  That's one of the reasons we have a 24-hour
[00:58:00.196 --> 00:58:03.177]  Flash sale on InfoWars Life Select Storable Foods.

[00:58:14.041 --> 00:58:18.362]  Everything from the tote, to the packaging, to the food, everything is made in the U.S.
[00:58:18.443 --> 00:58:22.084]  It's balanced kits with breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks, snacks.

[00:58:27.166 --> 00:58:27.926]  So once you open it,
[00:58:28.386 --> 00:58:33.107]  You can use it for a couple of days, but it will stay fresh for years.
[00:58:33.187 --> 00:58:35.347]  Again, a 24-hour flash sale.

[00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:49.070]  These are unstable times.
[00:58:51.391 --> 00:58:54.912]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:54.932 --> 00:58:56.992]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:59.673 --> 00:59:00.133]  Hey, everyone!
[00:59:00.493 --> 00:59:06.355]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:59:06.615 --> 00:59:08.216]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:59:08.696 --> 00:59:18.620]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:24.962]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:59:25.362 --> 00:59:25.783]  We're good to go.
[00:59:40.359 --> 00:59:41.840]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:13.499 --> 01:00:16.181]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:16.942 --> 01:00:23.027]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this February 11th, 2016.
[01:00:23.148 --> 01:00:24.569]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:29.634]  Joe Biggs is going to be joining us in the next segment with an update on what's going on the Oregon standoff.
[01:00:29.674 --> 01:00:33.898]  There have been some new developments there, of course, as we've been talking about this last hour.
[01:00:34.438 --> 01:00:35.599]  Cliven Bundy flew in.
[01:00:35.639 --> 01:00:38.341]  We've had Franklin Graham fly in.
[01:00:39.282 --> 01:00:42.384]  A state legislator from Nevada, Michelle Fiore, flew in.
[01:00:42.424 --> 01:00:46.247]  They're all trying to negotiate that down without getting anybody killed.
[01:00:46.508 --> 01:00:47.769]  They arrested Cliven Bundy.
[01:00:48.449 --> 01:00:53.093]  So we're going to get an update from Joe Biggs who's been following that broadcast live.
[01:00:53.133 --> 01:00:57.516]  There's a broadcast coming out of the refuge from that area.
[01:00:57.977 --> 01:00:59.358]  He's going to update us on the next segment.
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:12.783]  Real quickly, at the top of the Drudge Report, now we have a new article that came out of the Washington Post, this came out in the last hour, talking about the Clinton Foundation getting a subpoena from State Department investigators.
[01:01:12.803 --> 01:01:18.345]  They say investigators from the State Department issued a subpoena to the Bill Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation last fall.
[01:01:18.945 --> 01:01:26.994]  Seeking documents about the charity's projects that may have required approval from the federal government during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State.
[01:01:27.494 --> 01:01:29.716]  This is from somebody who's familiar with the subpoena.
[01:01:29.736 --> 01:01:32.760]  Now, the interesting thing about it, too, is Huma Abedin.
[01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:35.651]  Her very close personal assistant.
[01:01:35.711 --> 01:01:36.531]  We'll just leave it at that.
[01:01:37.112 --> 01:01:54.680]  Longtime aide, as it's put by Washington Post, who for six months in 2012 was employed simultaneously, get this, employed simultaneously by the State Department, the Clinton Foundation, the Clinton's personal office, and a private consulting firm with ties to the Clintons.
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:59.062]  I mean, she's not double-dipping, she's not triple-dipping, she's quadruple-dipping.
[01:01:59.642 --> 01:02:01.103]  Huma must be rich!
[01:02:01.604 --> 01:02:03.005]  You know, it's pretty amazing.
[01:02:03.025 --> 01:02:06.588]  Of course her husband, remember her husband was a wiener in New York.
[01:02:07.068 --> 01:02:10.851]  And of course she also has family ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:02:11.452 --> 01:02:13.273]  That's a very interesting character, Huma.
[01:02:13.834 --> 01:02:25.003]  Now they say a foundation representative who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing inquiry said the initial document request has been narrowed by investigators, the foundation's not the focus of the probe.
[01:02:25.643 --> 01:02:28.466]  And they say there's no indication that the watchdog is looking at Clinton.
[01:02:28.946 --> 01:02:30.606]  And Huma Abedin has declined comment.
[01:02:30.626 --> 01:02:34.387]  You know, I guess nobody is really being investigated by the subpoena.
[01:02:35.208 --> 01:02:37.048]  It's like they're not looking at anybody.
[01:02:37.108 --> 01:02:46.550]  They just wanted to get some information, I guess, to look at because they had nothing better to do, even though this is an inspector general who is looking at this.
[01:02:47.691 --> 01:02:54.952]  Now, in the amount of time that we've got left, I started talking about this in the previous segment, this article from The Telegraph.
[01:02:54.992 --> 01:02:56.933]  And there was just so much in this when I looked at it.
[01:02:58.291 --> 01:03:08.233]  When they talk about the fact that this could destroy capitalism as we know it, let's understand that capitalism as we know it has to be redefined.
[01:03:08.253 --> 01:03:17.736]  When we talk about free trade, as they mention here, they say this could threaten the very survival of free trade, of globalization, of the market-based economy.
[01:03:18.615 --> 01:03:22.436]  Let's understand that free trade, as it's being sold to us, is not free trade.
[01:03:23.637 --> 01:03:28.819]  A 5,000-page document called the Trans-Pacific Partnership is not free trade.
[01:03:29.059 --> 01:03:30.299]  That's managed trade.
[01:03:30.639 --> 01:03:35.261]  And it's even worse, because that document was written by corporate lawyers secretly.
[01:03:35.401 --> 01:03:36.381]  Lobbyists, okay?
[01:03:36.401 --> 01:03:37.742]  It wasn't written by our legislators.
[01:03:38.402 --> 01:03:46.810]  It's not going to go through the approval process for a treaty, and it's going to turn over the management of our economy, because that's what we're talking about here.
[01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:48.392]  We're not talking about something like trade.
[01:03:48.652 --> 01:03:50.233]  No, it's managing our economy.
[01:03:50.293 --> 01:03:53.056]  Who's going to get to sell what to who at what prices?
[01:03:53.436 --> 01:03:58.841]  It's going to turn all of that management over to a foreign international commission
[01:03:59.542 --> 01:04:01.583]  That we do not control.
[01:04:01.883 --> 01:04:02.203]  Okay?
[01:04:02.423 --> 01:04:03.864]  So let's not talk about free trade.
[01:04:04.264 --> 01:04:06.265]  Let's not say that free trade has failed.
[01:04:06.505 --> 01:04:15.068]  Let's not say that free markets have failed when you prop up these crony capitalist banks when they pump and dump the real estate market.
[01:04:15.448 --> 01:04:17.209]  That's not capitalism as I know it.
[01:04:17.469 --> 01:04:19.170]  That's not any definition of capitalism.
[01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:19.790]  It's certainly not
[01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:22.151]  The free market, okay?
[01:04:22.491 --> 01:04:26.612]  And globalization is not capitalism either, okay?
[01:04:26.652 --> 01:04:32.174]  Let's understand that globalization is a move to establish a global governance.
[01:04:32.214 --> 01:04:38.036]  First by economic unity, then by political unity when they create economic crisis.
[01:04:38.076 --> 01:04:40.336]  Let's understand what's behind all of this.
[01:04:40.696 --> 01:04:45.218]  We have to understand that when they talk about it's going to destroy people's faith in the elites.
[01:04:45.558 --> 01:04:45.818]  It's like,
[01:04:46.118 --> 01:04:47.198]  Yeah, I hope so.
[01:04:47.458 --> 01:04:56.141]  It's about time we wake up, understand what's behind this, understand that when they talk about free markets, when they talk about free trade, that's nonsense.
[01:04:56.321 --> 01:05:00.622]  What we need is real freedom, we need real liberty, we need free markets.
[01:05:00.662 --> 01:05:04.083]  Stay with us, we'll be right back for an update on the Oregon Standoff with Joe Biggs.
[01:05:09.821 --> 01:05:14.763]  Top story on Drudge Report this morning, gold surges to a one-year high on fears of financial uncertainty.
[01:05:14.983 --> 01:05:19.425]  That's right, spot gold has surged nearly 4% to $1,240 an ounce.
[01:05:19.705 --> 01:05:25.087]  It's highest since February 2015, and it's on track for its biggest daily rise since December 1st, 2014.
[01:05:25.347 --> 01:05:34.911]  The rise in gold is being triggered by financial instability fears that are fueled by European bank shares slumping to multi-year lows, with concerns mounting over banks' profitability and a low growth
[01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:35.531]  We're good to go.
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:00.601]  It's highest since November 2015.
[01:06:01.082 --> 01:06:06.008]  A year ago at this time, silver was hovering nearly $17.50 an ounce.
[01:06:06.388 --> 01:06:09.292]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:06:09.652 --> 01:06:16.020]  Our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:19.584]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[01:06:19.604 --> 01:06:23.348]  I needed to get my digestive system working correctly again.
[01:06:23.368 --> 01:06:23.809]  So I stumbled on the X2.
[01:06:24.009 --> 01:06:25.191]  I needed a detox basically.
[01:06:25.211 --> 01:06:25.951]  I started taking X2.
[01:06:40.248 --> 01:06:43.691]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves.
[01:06:43.892 --> 01:06:44.933]  What do you have to lose?
[01:06:45.213 --> 01:06:53.782]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:58.074]  I noticed significant change in my digestive flow.
[01:06:58.094 --> 01:06:59.595]  I was like really more natural.

[01:08:02.594 --> 01:08:06.578]  That's InfoWarsLive.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:08:12.563 --> 01:08:18.589]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:19.190 --> 01:08:22.192]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:28.219]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Thursday, February 11, 2016.
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:34.843]  I'm David Knight and joining me now is Joe Biggs with an update on what's going on in the Oregon standoff.
[01:08:34.943 --> 01:08:46.789]  Now, what we know from last night, and we're going to get a new update from this, Cliven Bundy and his family had sent out an email last night, said, come on all Americans, all patriots, all militia, now is the time.
[01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:47.669]  We need to go there.
[01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:50.071]  We need to be louder than they are.
[01:08:50.868 --> 01:08:52.848]  Now he flew into Portland.
[01:08:53.249 --> 01:08:55.729]  He was arrested at 10 10 p.m.
[01:08:55.909 --> 01:09:02.531]  Authorities there say that he is facing federal charges related to the 2014 standoff at the Bundy Ranch.
[01:09:02.611 --> 01:09:05.231]  Interesting that they would wait till this point to arrest him then.
[01:09:06.171 --> 01:09:09.132]  I heard that it was conspiracy charges.
[01:09:09.512 --> 01:09:15.714]  I don't know if they're trying to say that he's inciting violence in Oregon, but now they're saying that it is related to Nevada charges.
[01:09:15.734 --> 01:09:17.034]  We'll see what's going on with that.
[01:09:17.714 --> 01:09:22.337]  But meanwhile, after that, that was at 10.10 last night, at 5 a.m.
[01:09:22.397 --> 01:09:30.622]  this morning, Franklin Graham, North Carolina evangelist, son of Billy Graham, flew into the refuge to try to help to resolve this peacefully.
[01:09:30.642 --> 01:09:34.125]  There were four people in the refuge still.
[01:09:34.185 --> 01:09:39.748]  They were saying that the FBI was moving in closer last night, demanding that they surrender.
[01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:43.471]  Everyone was concerned that they were going to be spooked, that there was going to be a shootout.
[01:09:44.131 --> 01:09:55.104]  And so, Franklin Graham traveled to the area, Nevada Assemblywoman Michelle Fiore, who was the representative for the area in Bunkerville, where the standoff occurred in Nevada.
[01:09:55.504 --> 01:10:01.771]  She flew into the area, Clive and Bundy flew into the area, so they arrested Clive and Bundy to, I guess, try to de-escalate things.
[01:10:02.625 --> 01:10:05.167]  But now, giving us an update is Joe Biggs.
[01:10:05.207 --> 01:10:06.607]  Joe, tell us what's going on right now.
[01:10:06.928 --> 01:10:08.669]  Oh, well, let's start with last night.
[01:10:08.689 --> 01:10:23.177]  So last night, Gavin Syme, he's an activist, someone I met when I was actually in Spokane, Washington, back with Darren McBreen when we were speaking with Representative Matt Shea, talking about the Sheriff Ozzie Nesovich and all that that was going down with the MRAP, the Constitutionalists.
[01:10:25.876 --> 01:10:31.439]  This guy started a YouTube channel, had a live stream going, and on the phone he had the four remaining people inside.
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:44.907]  And they called in, they set up this whole conference call, they had Michelle Fiore, they had some other representatives that are with her as well, and they were talking about how the FBI was beginning to tighten the noose, so to say, around that refuge.
[01:10:44.927 --> 01:10:50.591]  They could hear the vehicles moving in strategically, helicopters were starting to fly overhead, and they were starting to panic and worry.
[01:10:51.151 --> 01:10:52.452]  So it was very tense last night.
[01:10:52.472 --> 01:10:54.173]  I listened up until about midnight or so.
[01:10:54.853 --> 01:11:00.196]  I tuned into it at one point, there was like 67,000 people live-streaming it at one point.
[01:11:00.236 --> 01:11:03.478]  We've got a clip from that where Michelle is talking to them, trying to negotiate that.
[01:11:03.739 --> 01:11:10.543]  Let's play a short clip that we've got of that, the remaining occupiers, when they were live-streaming just as Joe was talking about.
[01:11:10.563 --> 01:11:11.623]  Let's play that first clip.
[01:11:12.844 --> 01:11:18.748]  I need you guys to be alive in order for us to be able to make a change.
[01:11:18.988 --> 01:11:20.809]  This is the Nevada legislator talking to them.
[01:11:22.845 --> 01:11:25.826]  Okay, so that's what they were saying last night.
[01:11:49.892 --> 01:11:50.914]  No, no, I won't do that.
[01:12:06.718 --> 01:12:09.879]  Okay, let's hold it at that point, because it's kind of hard to hear that audio.
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.301]  And again, they're putting the audio up on the internet.
[01:12:13.341 --> 01:12:29.027]  It was a live broadcast, captured from phones, and that's the Nevada state legislator, Michelle Fiore, who's trying to talk some sense into them, and she was able to get them to say, alright, you get here, Franklin Graham gets here, and we will turn ourselves in in the morning.
[01:12:29.187 --> 01:12:30.247]  Okay, so that's what happened.
[01:12:30.287 --> 01:12:31.988]  So they got into Portland late last night.
[01:12:32.088 --> 01:12:37.890]  It was about a six hour, actually a little bit more than that because of snowy conditions, mountainous terrain, which you saw when we went last time.
[01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:42.612]  They didn't get in until, I would say about 9.30 this morning, I think it was.
[01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:46.594]  Yeah, so when I began to listen, 9.30 our time, Central, yeah.
[01:12:47.134 --> 01:12:48.215]  And they arrived.
[01:12:48.555 --> 01:12:49.877]  She was there with her group of people.
[01:12:49.917 --> 01:12:54.701]  They got to that FBI compound that I got footage of that's at that private airport in Burns.
[01:12:55.341 --> 01:12:57.804]  And they met Franklin Graham there.
[01:12:58.224 --> 01:13:00.966]  And then from there, they went inside, spoke I think for about 10 minutes.
[01:13:01.287 --> 01:13:04.169]  They cut the phone conversation off with the occupiers inside there.
[01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:06.171]  And then they had a conversation.
[01:13:06.191 --> 01:13:08.073]  They loaded up in vehicles and they began to travel.
[01:13:08.113 --> 01:13:09.034]  It's about 40 minutes.
[01:13:09.574 --> 01:13:10.254]  To the refuge.
[01:13:10.655 --> 01:13:13.316]  Now at this point in time, she's keeping her cell phone back on.
[01:13:13.356 --> 01:13:17.938]  This is Michelle Fior, continuing to talk with Gavin Syme and the four remaining people.
[01:13:18.778 --> 01:13:22.700]  And they're talking about, alright, when you guys get here, we're going to turn ourselves in.
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.361]  Our guns have already been locked in the vehicles.
[01:13:24.721 --> 01:13:26.502]  We do not have any personal guns on us.
[01:13:26.742 --> 01:13:27.943]  We will come out with our hands up.
[01:13:28.783 --> 01:13:30.884]  One of the guys said he was going to hold an American flag, which he did.
[01:13:30.924 --> 01:13:31.824]  I listened as it happened.
[01:13:32.365 --> 01:13:34.806]  And at this point in time, three of them have left.
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:43.383]  Michelle Fiore got there, Franklin Graham showed up, the FBI brought in a separate vehicle, they pushed forward, and three came out.
[01:13:43.504 --> 01:13:46.325]  Now, David Frye is still there.
[01:13:46.605 --> 01:13:59.752]  He's the guy that has the Stay in Your Base, Guard Your Base YouTube channel that had been live-streaming for, you know, since Amon Bundy and Ryan and all these guys were taken and put in FBI custody.
[01:14:00.672 --> 01:14:07.603]  So this guy is saying that I never agreed to this negotiation, this turning myself in.
[01:14:07.623 --> 01:14:10.648]  The other three said that that's something that they wanted to do.
[01:14:11.029 --> 01:14:12.111]  I have no part of this.
[01:14:12.211 --> 01:14:12.511]  They said...
[01:14:13.677 --> 01:14:16.858]  Basically he said that he was born a free man and he will die a free man.
[01:14:17.158 --> 01:14:26.961]  And one of the things he said, I think I'm looking at the time clock right now, it's about 42 minutes ago, he was talking to Chris Ann Hall on the show with Gavin and he said, I feel suicidal.
[01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:28.921]  He says, I'm going to stand my ground.
[01:14:29.301 --> 01:14:30.962]  And she kept saying, hey, you know, don't
[01:14:31.562 --> 01:14:32.163]  Don't do this.
[01:14:32.223 --> 01:14:33.444]  Everyone else has turned themselves in.
[01:14:33.504 --> 01:14:33.964]  Let's do this.
[01:14:33.984 --> 01:14:34.685]  Let's be peaceful.
[01:14:35.005 --> 01:14:36.687]  He said, no, I'm making my stand.
[01:14:36.747 --> 01:14:37.648]  I'm not going anywhere.
[01:14:37.668 --> 01:14:38.609]  This is my time.
[01:14:38.969 --> 01:14:39.930]  This is my stand.
[01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:41.672]  And at this point in time, this is where they're at.
[01:14:42.032 --> 01:14:44.554]  He's still there inside the campground little area.
[01:14:44.574 --> 01:14:48.258]  They have like a little tent set up and he's refusing to leave at this point in time.
[01:14:48.919 --> 01:14:50.059]  What do you know about David Frye?
[01:14:50.119 --> 01:15:03.763]  I mean, you see somebody that came in at the uh... later and I know he was the one who was broadcasting as we were there after they had arrested uh... the leaders Ammon Bundy, Ryan Bundy, LaVoy Finnegan was shot uh... David Frye was one who was the most vocal at that point in time.
[01:15:03.803 --> 01:15:04.843]  What do you know about David Frye?
[01:15:04.883 --> 01:15:08.144]  He's from Cincinnati, Ohio I believe, if I'm not mistaken.
[01:15:08.164 --> 01:15:09.024]  He's from that area.
[01:15:09.124 --> 01:15:16.106]  He uh... knew the other uh... journalist that was out there as well uh... those two had worked together I believe before and uh...
[01:15:17.526 --> 01:15:19.326]  So that's what's going on with this guy.
[01:15:19.386 --> 01:15:25.728]  He doesn't seem to really want to have this end peacefully.
[01:15:25.748 --> 01:15:34.550]  He thinks the only way is for him to go out in a blaze of glory or to sit there and remain and eventually run out of food and then leave.
[01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:35.730]  I don't know at this point in time.
[01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:43.792]  But we need to understand, you know, when you have a situation like this, you're going to have some people who are mentally unstable who will want to attach themselves to a larger movement.
[01:15:44.252 --> 01:15:47.193]  You're going to have some federal provocateurs who will come in and try to provoke things
[01:15:47.193 --> 01:15:47.594]  I don't think so.
[01:16:03.157 --> 01:16:06.239]  To send them to jail for the mandatory minimum of five years.
[01:16:06.419 --> 01:16:09.781]  They were tried and convicted as arsonists, as terrorists.
[01:16:09.841 --> 01:16:13.323]  There was absolutely no way the Hammond ranchers were terrorists.
[01:16:13.463 --> 01:16:22.068]  They had burned a small amount of land as a backfire, got a little bit out of control, burned 139 acres on federal land.
[01:16:22.108 --> 01:16:23.709]  To give you an idea how small that is,
[01:16:23.769 --> 01:16:28.415]  So we're over three and a half million acres that burned that year on federal lands, okay?
[01:16:28.795 --> 01:16:31.199]  Because they're not managing the lands very well.
[01:16:31.239 --> 01:16:39.589]  We talked to Logger and John Day talking about how they'd had the largest fire there this last summer that they've had.
[01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:43.931]  And it was because they leave the dead wood on the ground.
[01:16:43.991 --> 01:16:51.213]  They are so determined that nobody is going to use the land that they will let the forest burn down.
[01:16:51.793 --> 01:16:54.254]  So they can burn down the economy and get these people out of there.
[01:16:54.274 --> 01:16:57.595]  The only thing... And the companies get closed down too because they're not allowed to go out and do that work.
[01:16:57.815 --> 01:16:58.195]  Exactly.
[01:16:58.215 --> 01:16:58.995]  Take that stuff out.
[01:16:59.155 --> 01:17:07.086]  We showed all the logging, all the lumber mills that had shut down, and they're putting everyone out of business.
[01:17:07.127 --> 01:17:10.411]  The only thing that's being built in that area are federal stations.
[01:17:10.431 --> 01:17:12.554]  And you know, it was interesting, Joe, when I came in this morning,
[01:17:13.291 --> 01:17:14.532]  I was listening to the radio.
[01:17:14.592 --> 01:17:20.974]  They had NPR talking about an IMAX documentary somebody had done to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the National Park System.
[01:17:21.694 --> 01:17:31.138]  And the guy was saying, yeah, you know, well, I'm kind of conflicted about this because we really don't want to promote the national parks too much because people might go there and stress the parks out.
[01:17:31.198 --> 01:17:31.738]  I mean, that's how...
[01:17:32.458 --> 01:17:33.038]  I don't think so.
[01:17:54.033 --> 01:18:01.279]  Everything that they're talking about is how this is so special and the biggest enemy, the biggest predator, the biggest problem in the park is man.
[01:18:01.439 --> 01:18:02.880]  And that's what they have in the exhibit.
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:11.487]  It was funny though, when we drove from Ontario, Oregon out to Burns, I don't know if you remember me pointing this out, there was a national park called Your Land.
[01:18:12.408 --> 01:18:13.188]  It was closed.
[01:18:13.409 --> 01:18:14.449]  So my land was closed.
[01:18:14.489 --> 01:18:15.290]  I didn't even know about it.
[01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:17.111]  So I didn't even have access to my land.
[01:18:17.432 --> 01:18:18.733]  Oh, they want to lock everything down.
[01:18:18.933 --> 01:18:22.316]  I mean, they had a protest out in Utah because some
[01:18:23.349 --> 01:18:30.273]  Local county commissioners were upset about the fact that they were closing down what had been access roads for ATVs through the park.
[01:18:30.593 --> 01:18:34.395]  This is what the people who are in the cities and in the suburbs need to understand.
[01:18:35.216 --> 01:18:43.581]  These people who are ranchers, these people who are miners, they have surface rights, they have water rights, they have mineral rights, these are property rights just like your home is.
[01:18:44.181 --> 01:18:46.542]  And they produce things that you want.
[01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:47.943]  Things like meat.
[01:18:48.383 --> 01:18:49.104]  People forget about that.
[01:18:49.144 --> 01:18:49.884]  It's a good deal.
[01:18:49.924 --> 01:18:50.224]  What's that?
[01:18:50.324 --> 01:18:51.245]  People forget about that.
[01:18:51.485 --> 01:18:53.846]  Or they get where the wood for their furniture comes from.
[01:18:53.866 --> 01:18:54.406]  That's right.
[01:18:54.607 --> 01:18:57.988]  When these ranchers are affected, you at home are affected in the city.
[01:18:58.468 --> 01:19:12.335]  And they want to take that land away, make it private, push you into a city, put you in a small apartment, put you in a driverless car so they can monitor everything you do when you're not paying your taxes, when you're not paying your child support, lock that car down, notify authorities what's going on.
[01:19:12.675 --> 01:19:13.776]  That is the plan.
[01:19:14.096 --> 01:19:16.478]  And they're using this situation in Burns, Oregon right now.
[01:19:16.538 --> 01:19:29.590]  This is a federal PSYOP that they're using to demonize the quote-unquote patriot movement, the liberty movement, from these militiamen who are actually trying to make a stand for something that is worthy of taking a stand for.
[01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:33.513]  What Clive and Bundy did back in Nevada, what Amon Bundy's intentions were.
[01:19:33.913 --> 01:19:41.000]  Like we said, we agreed with his intentions, but the time and place was wrong with this entire thing, how it unfolded.
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:43.062]  But they're using this to demonize it.
[01:19:43.302 --> 01:19:48.008]  They're going, alright, we got these last four guys, they're kind of crazy, and they're blasting this stuff all over the place.
[01:19:48.068 --> 01:19:51.672]  And they've got them contained in that area, but look at what they're doing to the local ranchers.
[01:19:51.712 --> 01:19:53.534]  That's why they're letting this continue to go on.
[01:19:53.554 --> 01:19:56.217]  That's how they did it as long as they did it, to continue to demonize it.
[01:19:56.357 --> 01:20:00.422]  We talked to a couple of ranchers and said they've got Apache helicopters flying over our ranches.
[01:20:00.502 --> 01:20:05.347]  That's the kind of martial law intimidation that we see every time anything happens.
[01:20:05.407 --> 01:20:07.089]  The government is itching for that.
[01:20:07.349 --> 01:20:09.332]  We cannot give them the excuse.
[01:20:09.372 --> 01:20:10.233]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:20:11.374 --> 01:20:11.914]  We're good to go.
[01:20:35.314 --> 01:20:40.478]  According to a company spokesman, this is happening because we're worried that the people in Washington have an agenda.
[01:20:40.698 --> 01:20:42.379]  Control the food, control the people.
[01:20:42.699 --> 01:20:45.942]  You don't want to rely on the government to keep your family fed in a crisis.

[01:24:08.396 --> 01:24:20.541]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:20.601 --> 01:24:22.081]  I'm David Knight here with Joe Biggs.
[01:24:22.101 --> 01:24:25.083]  We've been talking about the latest developments in the Oregon Standoff.
[01:24:25.923 --> 01:24:31.147]  As Franklin Graham flew up from North Carolina, Michelle Fiore, the state legislator in Nevada, flew up.
[01:24:31.187 --> 01:24:34.590]  They were able to negotiate and get three out of the four people out of there.
[01:24:35.230 --> 01:24:35.931]  One remains.
[01:24:35.971 --> 01:24:37.452]  He sounds very suicidal.
[01:24:37.492 --> 01:24:41.175]  David Fry is talking about he's got a gun, pistol, he's going to shoot himself.
[01:24:41.255 --> 01:24:44.157]  So it's a very sad situation to see this developing.
[01:24:44.177 --> 01:24:47.000]  And we want to talk about what is really behind all of this.
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:51.303]  But before we do, real quickly, I want to let you know about the special sales we have.
[01:24:51.343 --> 01:24:51.923]  We have a 24-hour
[01:24:52.944 --> 01:24:55.384]  Flash sale at InfoWars Life.
[01:24:55.624 --> 01:24:58.485]  At InfoWars Life, select storable foods.
[01:24:58.545 --> 01:25:00.645]  We have 30-40% off retail.
[01:25:01.105 --> 01:25:02.246]  Our lowest prices of the year.
[01:25:02.426 --> 01:25:04.906]  And you get free shipping with orders over $50.
[01:25:05.566 --> 01:25:09.587]  Again, the food, all the packaging is made in the USA.
[01:25:10.087 --> 01:25:13.828]  It's balanced kits with breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks, and snacks.
[01:25:13.928 --> 01:25:16.968]  If you order a three-month supply or greater, you get the most variety.
[01:25:16.988 --> 01:25:20.649]  And everything comes in zip-lock packages, so nothing goes to waste.
[01:25:21.129 --> 01:25:22.249]  That's for limited time only.
[01:25:22.309 --> 01:25:26.610]  It's just a 24-hour flash sale on InfoWarsLife Select Storable Foods.
[01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:31.091]  30 to 40% off, plus free shipping on all orders over $50.
[01:25:31.351 --> 01:25:34.072]  You can find that at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:25:34.152 --> 01:25:39.973]  Also, it was so popular, we extended the introductory sale of AnthroPlex for one more day.
[01:25:40.013 --> 01:25:47.995]  And again, that's a sale where if you buy AnthroPlex and Supermail Vitality together, you get them 15% off, plus free shipping.
[01:25:48.035 --> 01:25:49.595]  This will definitely end tonight.
[01:25:49.995 --> 01:25:58.443]  And remember, this is the new twice daily pill formulation that works synergistically with super male vitality to help to restore your masculine foundation.
[01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:08.573]  It combats the estrogen compounds that you are facing and the plastic foods that you get, the runoff that you find in the water.
[01:26:09.173 --> 01:26:13.517]  It's one way that you can look after your health and also store up for your food.
[01:26:13.557 --> 01:26:14.778]  These two sales we've got going.
[01:26:14.838 --> 01:26:15.779]  Two big sales going.
[01:26:16.159 --> 01:26:17.460]  Both of them will end tonight.
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:24.766]  Again, the 15% off Supermail Vitality and Anthroplex with free shipping and also the storable food flash sale.
[01:26:25.007 --> 01:26:28.530]  30 to 40% off and free shipping on orders of $50 or more.
[01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:34.094]  Now, Joe, as we're looking at this, there was, and this is all coming out of the Oregon
[01:26:35.714 --> 01:26:42.597]  There's a sarcastic Facebook page that's been put up called the Public Lands Hunt Club.
[01:26:42.617 --> 01:26:44.138]  This is reported on the New American.
[01:26:45.198 --> 01:26:51.861]  Encouraging people to go out and shoot cattle on public lands if the people haven't paid their grazing fees.
[01:26:52.502 --> 01:26:56.804]  And as the New American points out, intentionally shooting somebody else's livestock is a crime.
[01:26:56.844 --> 01:26:57.584]  It's actually a felony.
[01:26:58.224 --> 01:27:04.629]  Okay, and they say doing it to make a political statement and to intimidate the owners might be considered to be terrorism.
[01:27:04.949 --> 01:27:08.592]  Okay, but of course we're not going to see the FBI go out there and arrest these people.
[01:27:08.752 --> 01:27:10.253]  Okay, we will see them.
[01:27:10.454 --> 01:27:12.075]  But don't they go and shoot cattle?
[01:27:12.315 --> 01:27:12.695]  That's right.
[01:27:12.735 --> 01:27:13.256]  They did shoot.
[01:27:13.436 --> 01:27:14.397]  They did at the Bundy Ranch.
[01:27:14.457 --> 01:27:14.877]  Exactly.
[01:27:14.917 --> 01:27:15.357]  Exactly.
[01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:15.698]  They did.
[01:27:15.738 --> 01:27:23.283]  They shot the prize bull and that's a lot of, that's a lot of value there in a prize bull as well as several other animals that were out there.
[01:27:24.304 --> 01:27:27.627]  This, to me, highlights a key issue.
[01:27:27.847 --> 01:27:32.852]  And that is the government has been more successful at pitting the left versus the right.
[01:27:32.952 --> 01:27:35.334]  Many people on the right hate the Occupy movement.
[01:27:35.394 --> 01:27:38.837]  They correctly point out these guys damaged private property.
[01:27:39.058 --> 01:27:39.718]  Okay, fine.
[01:27:40.319 --> 01:27:44.643]  But there's other ways to handle this other than some of the police brutality that we saw.
[01:27:45.083 --> 01:27:52.649]  There's other ways to handle it other than the FBI putting out a hit list for Occupy leaders with FBI snipers.
[01:27:52.729 --> 01:27:57.753]  As we saw released, it was a document that was leaked out about this happening in Houston.
[01:27:58.173 --> 01:28:04.357]  I don't want to see the government using those kinds of tactics and techniques to shut down protests.
[01:28:04.898 --> 01:28:13.885]  I think the Occupiers, many of them have been captured by a lot of, kind of more from a socialist standpoint, but both the Occupiers and the Tea Party,
[01:28:14.505 --> 01:28:22.529]  We're concerned about this kind of corruption that we saw in the wake of the 2008 financial collapse, the pump and dump that the banks did.
[01:28:23.349 --> 01:28:32.374]  They had legitimate concerns, and just because they were coming from the left, just because they did some damage in some areas, is no reason to start plotting to execute them.
[01:28:32.734 --> 01:28:42.936]  There's also no reason for the left to call for the execution of people at the Bundy standoff, to be excited about the fact that Lavoie Finnegan was killed.
[01:28:42.956 --> 01:29:00.480]  And I'm seeing plenty of that, and it makes me disgusted to see people on the left and on the right who hate each other so much that they're calling for the government to act like terrorists, to murder their own citizens, to shut down free speech, to shut down the right to petition your government, to talk about your grievances with the government.
[01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:01.700]  And that was what was happening.
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:07.884]  They were on their way to a meeting of 400 people and they were going to talk about the land use issues there.
[01:29:08.624 --> 01:29:14.868]  They were not, the people there were not afraid of them, as the media in Oregon like to portray this.
[01:29:15.369 --> 01:29:17.530]  We need to be able to have that kind of discussion.
[01:29:17.650 --> 01:29:31.359]  This is very dangerous when the government acts in this egregious way to shut down the free exercise of speech, to shut down and demonize people because they happen to be carrying firearms, not threatening people with them, just carrying them as a threat.
[01:29:31.539 --> 01:29:44.327]  I mean, when Black Lives Matter had their issues with things, if anyone disagreed with it, they were completely demonized, called racist, called bigots, and we had to apologize, and we had to come out and bow down before it.
[01:29:44.587 --> 01:29:55.193]  But when you have this group go out and make a stand, a good stand for something that's legitimate, that will affect us all down the road, completely demonized, shut down, and ridiculed.
[01:29:55.413 --> 01:29:58.275]  And make sure that nobody sees the underlying issues behind this.
[01:29:58.315 --> 01:29:59.336]  Thank you very much, Joe Biggs.
[01:29:59.356 --> 01:30:00.016]  We'll be right back.
[01:30:09.861 --> 01:30:20.208]  Socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is having breakfast in Harlem this morning with former Coke dealer and FBI informant Reverend Al Sharpton.
[01:30:20.549 --> 01:30:32.517]  Sanders is hoping for an endorsement from Sharpton and hopes that it will boost his reputation among young black voters who, according to recent poll numbers, overwhelmingly support Hillary Clinton.
[01:30:32.737 --> 01:30:44.260]  This morning's meeting with the Reverend Al is at Sylvia's Restaurant, the very same place that Barack Obama sat down with a preacher in 2008, and they've since become very close friends.
[01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:55.563]  In fact, Al Sharpton has somehow managed to get away with owing $4 million in back taxes to the IRS, perhaps because of his cozy relationship with the President.
[01:30:55.843 --> 01:30:57.564]  So how ironic is this?
[01:30:58.084 --> 01:31:04.909]  Bernie Sanders, a guy who wants to raise taxes, is having breakfast with a guy who doesn't pay them.
[01:31:05.769 --> 01:31:08.892]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.

[01:33:45.234 --> 01:33:49.475]  I want to play for you a clip that was recorded by Ammon Bundy from jail.
[01:33:49.495 --> 01:33:59.037]  It was put up last, uh, it was recorded last Saturday, put up on Monday, and I want you to hear what he has to say about free speech and civil disobedience.
[01:34:00.717 --> 01:34:01.958]  Ammon Bundy, February 6, 2016.
[01:34:04.144 --> 01:34:14.352]  This is a call to action for any elected representative in Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Wyoming, Utah, Arizona, the state of Washington, and Ohio.
[01:34:14.933 --> 01:34:17.115]  You have constituents in federal custody.
[01:34:17.615 --> 01:34:24.521]  Please visit and contact them to voice your support for free speech, the right to assemble, and civil disobedience.
[01:34:25.141 --> 01:34:29.885]  It is your duty to hold federal agencies at bay, protecting the people in your state.
[01:34:30.826 --> 01:34:32.928]  And to those who disagree with my speech,
[01:34:33.547 --> 01:34:35.028]  Or our civil disobedience.
[01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:39.772]  And may dislike our ideas regarding that the land belongs to the people.
[01:34:40.373 --> 01:34:45.937]  Please remember that you do not want free speech to be retaliated against by government officials.
[01:34:46.778 --> 01:34:54.765]  If you do not advocate for government to tolerate ideas that it hates, then the First Amendment and free speech mean nothing.
[01:34:55.585 --> 01:34:56.906]  Arm yourself with ideas.
[01:34:57.487 --> 01:34:58.928]  Arm yourself with education.
[01:34:59.568 --> 01:35:00.729]  Argue and disagree.
[01:35:00.749 --> 01:35:01.870]  Be free.
[01:35:03.635 --> 01:35:04.055]  Thank you.
[01:35:04.656 --> 01:35:05.857]  That's what you need to understand.
[01:35:06.477 --> 01:35:15.725]  You need to understand whether or not you agree with them, and I'm saying this to the people that are pouring out hatred on social media, begging the government to execute people.
[01:35:15.745 --> 01:35:23.030]  I gotta say to you, that is, you have to understand just how dangerous that is, and how that will come back and reflect on you.
[01:35:23.070 --> 01:35:27.394]  We talked about what happened to the occupiers as well, and I'm saying this to the people on the right as well.
[01:35:27.734 --> 01:35:29.916]  You have to understand that when you disagree with somebody,
[01:35:30.677 --> 01:35:38.006]  Don't call for the government to suspend the Constitution, to trash the First Amendment, to execute the protesters, okay?
[01:35:38.647 --> 01:35:39.388]  Don't call for that.
[01:35:40.109 --> 01:35:41.231]  It's going to come back on you.
[01:35:41.631 --> 01:35:43.514]  Remember what John F. Kennedy said.
[01:35:44.154 --> 01:35:47.138]  He said, when we make peaceful revolution impossible,
[01:35:47.847 --> 01:35:50.148]  We make violent revolution inevitable.
[01:35:50.848 --> 01:35:56.411]  We cannot destroy our cherished freedoms because we disagree with somebody.
[01:35:56.651 --> 01:36:03.835]  We cannot allow the rule of law to be taken away by executive order, regardless of what you think about these issues.
[01:36:03.855 --> 01:36:13.780]  For those people who support Barack Obama's efforts to enact, for example, gun control or these other aspects of his agenda by executive order, understand that someday
[01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:25.782]  If you allow this, if you create a Caesar, a dictator to run this country, you're going to have somebody that has very different ideas from you become a Caesar, become a dictator.
[01:36:26.102 --> 01:36:28.863]  You do not want to cross the Rubicon, okay?
[01:36:29.143 --> 01:36:37.444]  You do not want to live in a country where we destroy the rule of law, where we destroy our free speech protections, where we destroy the Constitution.
[01:36:37.924 --> 01:36:41.605]  Let me give you an example of this too, because one of the things that's very troubling as we were out there,
[01:36:42.597 --> 01:36:48.601]  Was to see how the government uses every excuse to create martial law.
[01:36:49.082 --> 01:36:56.627]  Setting up these checkpoints, and not just having checkpoints, but pointing guns at ranchers who are there.
[01:36:56.847 --> 01:37:08.055]  We've had the report, take a look at the report that I had, of the rancher who said he's been in third world banana republics, he's been concerned about his safety when he went through those checkpoints in those third world countries.
[01:37:08.595 --> 01:37:18.259]  But even there, he never had anybody point a gun in his face and threaten him like they did in his own neighborhood, going to his own home.
[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:20.180]  We can't allow this.
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.521]  We've seen this happen in the wake of the Boston bombing.
[01:37:22.921 --> 01:37:23.922]  One guy is at large.
[01:37:23.962 --> 01:37:26.403]  So they start pulling people out of their houses at gunpoint.
[01:37:26.663 --> 01:37:27.863]  They're doing the same thing out there.
[01:37:27.883 --> 01:37:31.805]  They've got Apache helicopters flying over these people's ranches.
[01:37:32.305 --> 01:37:33.526]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:37:33.546 --> 01:37:35.987]  The government is looking for every excuse
[01:37:36.747 --> 01:37:37.768]  To create martial law.
[01:37:38.248 --> 01:37:44.591]  That's why they have prepositioned these MRAPs and these other things, but now they bring them in to a small area like this.
[01:37:44.611 --> 01:37:48.913]  You've got a refuge where nobody has done anything, committed any violence.
[01:37:49.133 --> 01:37:53.035]  They're in a refuge in the middle of winter where people go to watch birds, okay?
[01:37:53.115 --> 01:37:53.855]  It's the middle of winter.
[01:37:53.895 --> 01:37:54.696]  There's nobody there.
[01:37:55.096 --> 01:37:56.797]  They weren't doing any damage to anything.
[01:37:56.837 --> 01:37:57.797]  They were protesting.
[01:37:58.578 --> 01:38:02.740]  They happen to have guns, which is protected by the Constitution and protected by Oregon law.
[01:38:03.442 --> 01:38:04.442]  They didn't threaten anybody.
[01:38:04.502 --> 01:38:06.763]  People were not concerned about them, not afraid of them.
[01:38:06.803 --> 01:38:10.124]  They were going to meet and speak to 400 people in a public meeting.
[01:38:10.804 --> 01:38:17.186]  So the government finds it necessary to use over-the-top violence and kill someone who had his hands up.
[01:38:18.266 --> 01:38:19.966]  Many people say, well, he's reaching for a gun.
[01:38:20.006 --> 01:38:21.887]  That is not clear from that video.
[01:38:21.907 --> 01:38:28.929]  If they wanted to make that clear, believe me, they've got more video than just an overhead aerial drone with no sound.
[01:38:28.969 --> 01:38:33.110]  They could make it clear if they really wanted to that they felt that they were threatened.
[01:38:33.865 --> 01:38:35.607]  But let's look at some of the other aspects of this.
[01:38:35.647 --> 01:38:39.972]  Think about what it's going to be like to live in a minority report style society.
[01:38:40.012 --> 01:38:44.657]  There's an interesting art project that was done by Dutch photographer Esther Hovers.
[01:38:45.418 --> 01:38:47.220]  This was first reported by Wired Magazine.
[01:38:48.222 --> 01:38:53.307]  She has installed cameras that have been installed in various US cities.
[01:38:53.948 --> 01:38:57.030]  Boston, Chicago, Washington, D.C., the Atlanta transit system.
[01:38:57.571 --> 01:39:05.957]  She wanted to make the point of when they do this minority report investigation, having individuals looking and tagging suspicious activity.
[01:39:06.057 --> 01:39:10.040]  Yeah, let's see something, say something, and call the SWAT team, okay?
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:20.913]  This is something that has been reported before, but in her particular case, what she did was just took some video and she gave it to people to analyze in the crime detection.
[01:39:21.754 --> 01:39:25.679]  They pointed out people who were loitering too long, or people who were moving too fast.
[01:39:25.939 --> 01:39:26.859]  Or people who are standing.
[01:39:26.919 --> 01:39:33.021]  So, if you stand too long, if you stand on a corner, if you move faster than they think, maybe you're looking over your shoulder.
[01:39:33.321 --> 01:39:40.022]  Maybe you're going against the flow of foot traffic, or you're abandoning something, or there's a cluster of people that suddenly break apart.
[01:39:40.042 --> 01:39:40.602]  Okay?
[01:39:41.002 --> 01:39:41.543]  All these things.
[01:39:41.583 --> 01:39:46.824]  In other words, is there anything that you can't do that doesn't look suspicious to these people?
[01:39:46.884 --> 01:39:47.724]  That's the bottom line.
[01:39:48.894 --> 01:39:51.416]  I remember seeing a project about this a couple of years ago.
[01:39:52.337 --> 01:39:57.121]  They had some AI intelligence that was trying to flag this, Minority Report style.
[01:39:57.542 --> 01:40:04.508]  They had a guy who walks up to his car, he stops, he pauses, he looks at it for a second, and then he bends down and disappears, and you don't see him for a while.
[01:40:05.248 --> 01:40:05.709]  Suspicious.
[01:40:06.567 --> 01:40:07.527]  Notify the police.
[01:40:08.008 --> 01:40:08.908]  Send the SWAT team.
[01:40:09.488 --> 01:40:11.669]  Well, what was, was he had a flat tire.
[01:40:12.289 --> 01:40:15.190]  And he was bent down and he was working on his tire.
[01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:22.833]  But of course, we could call the SWAT team and they could show up and get all excited and Barney Fife mode, start yelling and screaming at the guy.
[01:40:22.853 --> 01:40:27.075]  He panics, he gets up, he's got a tire iron in his hand and they shoot him, right?
[01:40:28.015 --> 01:40:29.717]  That's not that preposterous.
[01:40:29.757 --> 01:40:37.903]  We've seen young men who have a BB gun and they're just playing like the kid in Christmas Story, Red Rider, right?
[01:40:38.484 --> 01:40:39.505]  Black kid in a park.
[01:40:40.305 --> 01:40:41.967]  And the police show up and shoot him dead.
[01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:50.951]  That's 21st century America, very different from 1950 America, when they did that with the red Ryder BB gun.
[01:40:51.592 --> 01:40:53.712]  Do we really want to live in that kind of society?
[01:40:54.312 --> 01:41:02.454]  We are allowing them to create a paranoid, nightmare society for this, and we cannot allow this to happen.
[01:41:02.714 --> 01:41:04.814]  This project makes a good example of that.
[01:41:04.854 --> 01:41:06.114]  Let me give you another example.
[01:41:06.735 --> 01:41:08.935]  And this is something out of the presidential campaign.
[01:41:10.259 --> 01:41:13.121]  We talk about waterboarding, okay?
[01:41:13.241 --> 01:41:18.363]  And this is something that, this involves Donald Trump, but all the Republicans are doing this.
[01:41:18.423 --> 01:41:20.144]  Unfortunately, we don't have a choice.
[01:41:20.464 --> 01:41:25.087]  They're all trying to be tougher than the next guy when it comes to terrorism, okay?
[01:41:26.383 --> 01:41:32.005]  So, Donald Trump says, oh, I would go way beyond waterboarding when he's asked, okay?
[01:41:32.065 --> 01:41:41.708]  And of course his son comes out and says, look, he told Greta Van Susteren on Fox News, he said, listen, you see these terrorists that are flying planes into buildings, right?
[01:41:41.748 --> 01:41:44.949]  You see our cities getting shot up in California, you see Paris getting shot up.
[01:41:45.569 --> 01:41:53.871]  Then somebody complains when a terrorist gets waterboarded, which quite frankly is no different than what happens on college campuses and frat houses every day.
[01:41:54.852 --> 01:41:55.532]  It's like, what?
[01:41:56.673 --> 01:41:56.953]  What?
[01:41:58.073 --> 01:42:02.555]  Waterboarding is no different than what happens in a college frat house?
[01:42:03.855 --> 01:42:04.476]  I don't think so.
[01:42:05.336 --> 01:42:06.356]  It's not a keg party.
[01:42:07.416 --> 01:42:19.580]  And before I get into what waterboarding really is, because the New American did a great story talking about what waterboarding really is, we need to understand, just like this Minority Report, what are we doing to our country?
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:24.222]  What are we allowing them to do to us in the name of fighting terrorism?
[01:42:25.299 --> 01:42:26.160]  You have to be careful.
[01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:35.125]  Whenever you fight a war, and we're supposedly in a war against a tactic, you have to be careful when you fight a war that you don't become what you fight.
[01:42:35.705 --> 01:42:37.806]  Our government is becoming the terrorists.
[01:42:38.387 --> 01:42:41.549]  Our government is using the tactic of terrorism against us.
[01:42:41.909 --> 01:42:45.091]  Fear, intimidation, and violence to achieve a political means.
[01:42:46.031 --> 01:42:49.173]  You cannot allow them to become the terrorists.
[01:42:49.513 --> 01:42:50.754]  But let me just say this, too.
[01:42:50.814 --> 01:42:53.396]  He says somebody complains when a terrorist gets waterboarded.
[01:42:54.042 --> 01:42:55.763]  Who defines what a terrorist is?
[01:42:56.283 --> 01:42:57.444]  Do you have due process?
[01:42:58.224 --> 01:43:00.345]  Are they going to bring charges to you?
[01:43:00.445 --> 01:43:03.027]  Are you going to have a day in court before they label you a terrorist?
[01:43:03.367 --> 01:43:06.048]  I don't have a problem with a terrorist being punished.
[01:43:06.789 --> 01:43:18.395]  But I have a problem, and of course Fox News is the place where this happens the most, just label somebody a terrorist and that gives you carte blanche to do anything you want to to that person who has been labeled a terrorist.
[01:43:19.363 --> 01:43:22.444]  They labeled the people of the Bundy Ranch terrorists.
[01:43:22.944 --> 01:43:23.804]  They were not terrorists.
[01:43:24.524 --> 01:43:25.564]  Harry Reid said they were.
[01:43:25.604 --> 01:43:26.645]  They were not terrorists.
[01:43:26.705 --> 01:43:27.665]  They were protesters.
[01:43:27.925 --> 01:43:30.085]  They were people who had been oppressed by their government.
[01:43:30.625 --> 01:43:32.626]  A government that had used excessive force against them.
[01:43:32.666 --> 01:43:34.066]  They took back their property.
[01:43:34.926 --> 01:43:35.906]  They were not terrorists.
[01:43:36.547 --> 01:43:38.267]  Now, let me tell you what terrorism is.
[01:43:39.527 --> 01:43:40.988]  Waterboarding is terrorism.
[01:43:41.328 --> 01:43:42.488]  Let me give you an example of this.
[01:43:43.427 --> 01:43:44.528]  This is from the New American.
[01:43:44.908 --> 01:43:53.612]  Many regard waterboarding as a form of water torture, in which water is poured over a cloth covering the face and breathing passages of a restrained captive.
[01:43:54.072 --> 01:44:01.096]  It causes the individual being waterboarded to experience the sensation he's being drowned, and in fact, that is what is happening.
[01:44:01.696 --> 01:44:05.878]  If not halted in time, the subject will die by drowning, and this has happened.
[01:44:07.466 --> 01:44:11.887]  Former CIA officer Bob Baer contends that it often extracts worthless confessions.
[01:44:11.907 --> 01:44:12.567]  We know this!
[01:44:13.187 --> 01:44:16.368]  Stop watching Jack Bauer on 24.
[01:44:16.608 --> 01:44:19.669]  Listen to the people who know what they're talking about.
[01:44:19.929 --> 01:44:24.010]  The people in the CIA and the military tells you torture doesn't work.
[01:44:24.650 --> 01:44:25.530]  This is what he says.
[01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:29.051]  He says, I mean, you can't get anyone to confess anything.
[01:44:29.231 --> 01:44:32.292]  You can get anyone to confess anything if the torture is bad enough.
[01:44:32.972 --> 01:44:33.692]  Writing in another
[01:44:34.653 --> 01:44:36.094]  Publication, national interest.
[01:44:36.134 --> 01:44:39.577]  Remy Moduit recounted his personal experience.
[01:44:39.597 --> 01:44:44.240]  Here's somebody who has suffered it, his personal experience at having been waterboarded.
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:51.526]  He said, waterboarding is often described as simulated drowning or a technique to convince the interrogated that he or she is drowning.
[01:44:52.206 --> 01:44:56.109]  There is no way to simulate the lungs filling with fluid.
[01:44:57.150 --> 01:44:59.832]  And the victim does not need to be convinced physiologically.
[01:45:00.112 --> 01:45:02.874]  They are in the process of drowning.
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:08.322]  He went on to explain, waterboarding is difficult to understand without first-hand experience.
[01:45:08.922 --> 01:45:11.703]  Yeah, Eric, it's not like your frat parties, okay?
[01:45:12.183 --> 01:45:17.906]  I know you probably had this big tube of booze, of beer, and you stuck it in your mouth, and you thought you were drowning, okay?
[01:45:17.966 --> 01:45:19.226]  It's not like that, alright?
[01:45:19.666 --> 01:45:20.507]  Not like that at all.
[01:45:21.087 --> 01:45:22.067]  Let me tell you what it's like.
[01:45:22.768 --> 01:45:25.829]  He says the tortured person, he said, this is somebody who actually has done it, Eric,
[01:45:27.432 --> 01:45:35.255]  It says that this near-drowning will happen repeatedly and will eventually culminate with that promised slow and agonizing death.
[01:45:35.295 --> 01:45:41.037]  You're constantly being reminded by this by your tortures, not by your enhanced interrogators.
[01:45:41.877 --> 01:45:45.618]  That's some more CIA Pentagon double-speak.
[01:45:45.698 --> 01:45:46.799]  This is torture, folks.
[01:45:47.359 --> 01:45:52.881]  He says, in spite of my frenzied fight to survive, I prayed so many times for death and deliverance from pain.
[01:45:55.142 --> 01:45:56.122]  He says you talk a lot.
[01:45:57.182 --> 01:46:03.465]  You say anything, absolutely anything, to get the torture to stop.
[01:46:05.606 --> 01:46:06.627]  He says you throw up a lot.
[01:46:07.147 --> 01:46:11.549]  You talk, you scream like a demented person whenever you can, and then you throw up again.
[01:46:11.569 --> 01:46:13.970]  This is what our government does!
[01:46:15.051 --> 01:46:17.532]  This is what they call enhanced interrogation.
[01:46:18.697 --> 01:46:26.465]  When they shoot up weddings, when they execute innocent people in the Middle East with their drone strikes, that's called a disposition matrix.
[01:46:26.825 --> 01:46:30.068]  They have wonderful phrases for it, or collateral damage, you know?
[01:46:30.388 --> 01:46:32.751]  We have these nice phrases, just call it what it is.
[01:46:33.631 --> 01:46:37.695]  It's murder, it's torture, it's like something out of the Middle Ages.
[01:46:38.686 --> 01:46:47.369]  And at the same time, we've got our laws being shut down to establish Star Chamber procedures, where you are accused of being a terrorist.
[01:46:47.589 --> 01:46:49.030]  You're put on a terrorist watch list.
[01:46:49.170 --> 01:46:50.870]  You're put on a no-fly watch list.
[01:46:51.190 --> 01:46:51.451]  Okay?
[01:46:51.471 --> 01:46:53.191]  You're put on all kinds of lists.
[01:46:53.431 --> 01:46:57.713]  You don't even know you're on the list, because this is a secret procedure.
[01:46:58.433 --> 01:47:03.755]  You're not given the rights that we fought for in Western civilization a thousand years ago.
[01:47:05.063 --> 01:47:13.559]  The right to know and face your accusers, to answer your charges, to be publicly charged, to have due process.
[01:47:14.621 --> 01:47:17.065]  That is guaranteed in the Constitution.
[01:47:18.137 --> 01:47:33.824]  And when we have a government that swears allegiance to the Constitution as terms of having their offices made, understand that Constitution, the rule of law is like the king that they swear allegiance to.
[01:47:33.884 --> 01:47:36.365]  These are merely temporary stewards.
[01:47:37.806 --> 01:47:39.947]  The rule of law is over them.
[01:47:41.598 --> 01:47:43.899]  We established that rule of law collectively.
[01:47:43.919 --> 01:47:48.061]  We said we're not going to be ruled by dictators, by men.
[01:47:48.121 --> 01:47:49.961]  We're going to be ruled by law.
[01:47:50.081 --> 01:47:52.302]  These are the principles by which we will be governed.
[01:47:52.562 --> 01:48:00.926]  If you're going to be in government, if you're going to wear a uniform, have a gun, be able to use force against other people, you are going to swear to these principles.
[01:48:01.206 --> 01:48:07.889]  You are going to swear to the Bill of Rights that says that there are certain things you will not do.
[01:48:08.789 --> 01:48:10.710]  That is a condition of your authority.
[01:48:11.954 --> 01:48:16.759]  When you lie, when you go back on your oath, you have no authority.
[01:48:17.499 --> 01:48:21.463]  And we began to live in a kind of medieval dictatorship.
[01:48:21.743 --> 01:48:25.547]  Don't be surprised when you see the government executing people on the streets.
[01:48:25.887 --> 01:48:32.954]  It isn't because you're black, it isn't because you're a redneck farmer that people don't like, or you're doing the right...
[01:48:33.519 --> 01:48:38.503]  This is going to continue to happen because we no longer value the rule of law.
[01:48:38.523 --> 01:48:40.464]  We don't understand what juries are for.
[01:48:40.824 --> 01:48:42.505]  We don't care about our neighbors.
[01:48:42.585 --> 01:48:45.087]  And we listen to the news when they demonize people.
[01:48:45.107 --> 01:48:47.008]  And we say, yeah, I don't like this guy.
[01:48:47.229 --> 01:48:48.429]  I don't agree with his cause.
[01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:50.411]  So lock him up or shoot him.
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:57.422]  We heard people say that about Alex Jones when he went on with Piers Morgan, remember?
[01:48:57.542 --> 01:48:58.462]  They were joking about it.
[01:48:58.502 --> 01:49:01.163]  It was Huntsman's daughter, okay?
[01:49:01.183 --> 01:49:03.363]  One of the guys who was running for president.
[01:49:04.404 --> 01:49:06.984]  Huntsman's daughter says, yeah, shoot him in uniform.
[01:49:07.005 --> 01:49:07.425]  Remember that?
[01:49:07.445 --> 01:49:09.805]  Yeah, we don't agree with them, so just shoot him.
[01:49:11.226 --> 01:49:14.627]  Well, you know, part of this is going to be the control grid that's being established.
[01:49:15.147 --> 01:49:17.908]  And every day seems like there's another story about
[01:49:19.099 --> 01:49:21.443]  Automatic self-driving cars.
[01:49:22.004 --> 01:49:23.647]  And again, they're robot cars.
[01:49:23.987 --> 01:49:26.071]  They're going to be controlled by the government, okay?
[01:49:26.131 --> 01:49:30.398]  They're software cars and they keep calling them self-driving cars, and I guess...
[01:49:32.321 --> 01:49:34.143]  They call them driverless cars as well.
[01:49:34.203 --> 01:49:46.091]  I guess we can't call them driverless cars anymore because now Google and Silicon Valley has told the federal government that they are going to allow these computerized cars to qualify as drivers.
[01:49:46.152 --> 01:49:47.513]  So now they're no longer driverless.
[01:49:47.913 --> 01:49:49.494]  Now the car itself is the driver.
[01:49:49.534 --> 01:49:51.235]  It's going to be officially recognized as this.
[01:49:52.016 --> 01:49:55.879]  The National Highway Traffic Safety Association will interpret driver quote-unquote
[01:49:56.579 --> 01:50:04.424]  In the context of Google's described motor vehicle designs as referring to the self-driving system, not to any of the vehicle occupants.
[01:50:04.464 --> 01:50:07.867]  That's a great way, see the feds, they go to the feds and they say, you know what?
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:16.288]  We have all these safety regulations that are being put on us at the local and the state level, so we would like for you to just make those go away.
[01:50:16.448 --> 01:50:20.092]  So one of the ways we could do this is to say, well, yeah, it has a driver.
[01:50:20.132 --> 01:50:20.993]  The driver is the car.
[01:50:21.053 --> 01:50:22.094]  The driver is the computer.
[01:50:22.214 --> 01:50:29.702]  So whatever Silicon Valley and Google and these people want, they just go to the feds and the feds say, yes, sir.
[01:50:30.303 --> 01:50:31.084]  Anything else you'd like?
[01:50:31.984 --> 01:50:32.765]  You want something else?
[01:50:32.805 --> 01:50:34.166]  We'll just put that in there as well.
[01:50:34.586 --> 01:50:36.287]  And that's the way this thing is going to be greased.
[01:50:36.327 --> 01:50:38.629]  That's the way it's going to come to pass.
[01:50:38.949 --> 01:50:42.371]  And it's going to happen to us much more quickly than you think it is.
[01:50:42.471 --> 01:50:45.173]  I don't think there's going to be any liability issues that are going to stand in the way.
[01:50:45.373 --> 01:50:46.514]  They want this very badly.
[01:50:46.794 --> 01:50:47.895]  The car companies want it.
[01:50:48.175 --> 01:50:49.256]  Silicon Valley wants it.
[01:50:49.276 --> 01:50:50.237]  The computer companies want it.
[01:50:50.417 --> 01:50:57.121]  And the government wants it the most of all because they want to have a complete surveillance grid to tax and track you everywhere you go.
[01:50:57.161 --> 01:50:57.782]  When you look at this,
[01:50:58.522 --> 01:51:01.242]  Train crash in Germany, what was the first thing they did?
[01:51:01.543 --> 01:51:05.143]  They said, oh, we think a human shut down our computerized system.
[01:51:05.183 --> 01:51:07.344]  And the German police looked at it and said, nope, didn't happen.
[01:51:07.844 --> 01:51:08.344]  Guess again.
[01:51:08.604 --> 01:51:10.724]  They always blame it on the people, never on the computer.
[01:51:10.744 --> 01:51:12.664]  My dad was 69 and collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:51:12.985 --> 01:51:15.605]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:51:15.625 --> 01:51:16.025]  Croix River.
[01:51:16.345 --> 01:51:18.345]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:51:18.586 --> 01:51:21.306]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:51:21.546 --> 01:51:22.066]  His excuse?
[01:51:22.426 --> 01:51:23.486]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:51:23.766 --> 01:51:25.047]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:51:25.367 --> 01:51:26.067]  At less than $107 per month,
[01:51:27.447 --> 01:51:30.871]  LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[01:51:31.131 --> 01:51:31.852]  Don't wait.

[01:52:09.871 --> 01:52:13.594]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:52:13.854 --> 01:52:19.978]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:52:20.158 --> 01:52:27.142]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:52:27.442 --> 01:52:36.188]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[01:52:36.548 --> 01:52:42.472]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:52:42.712 --> 01:52:47.495]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:52:47.555 --> 01:52:50.897]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:52:51.137 --> 01:52:52.758]  No needles, no injections.
[01:52:53.038 --> 01:52:54.559]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:52:54.679 --> 01:52:55.720]  Try it for yourself.
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:57.441]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[01:53:10.033 --> 01:53:12.696]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[01:53:12.776 --> 01:53:16.239]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[01:53:17.463 --> 01:53:20.624]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[01:53:20.944 --> 01:53:26.026]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[01:53:26.386 --> 01:53:27.607]  How is this even possible?
[01:53:27.867 --> 01:53:35.189]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[01:53:35.409 --> 01:53:42.832]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[01:53:43.052 --> 01:53:46.253]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[01:53:46.533 --> 01:53:53.956]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[01:53:54.356 --> 01:53:57.057]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[01:53:57.517 --> 01:54:01.658]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[01:54:01.678 --> 01:54:02.318]  That's Greens75.com.
[01:54:02.338 --> 01:54:02.718]  Greens75.com.
[01:54:18.191 --> 01:54:19.634]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:19.674 --> 01:54:24.064]  I've got some important news about one candidate who we really haven't paid much attention to.
[01:54:25.246 --> 01:54:26.188]  Vermin Supreme.
[01:54:26.990 --> 01:54:28.052]  It's been a perennial candidate.
[01:54:28.709 --> 01:54:29.149]  Very funny.
[01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:36.134]  I'll tell you this in just a moment, but before I do, I'll put this bottle here on the desk to remind me that we have a sale on Prostagard.
[01:54:36.755 --> 01:54:38.236]  15% off Prostagard.
[01:54:38.276 --> 01:54:43.319]  And of course, this is our new formula to help support men's health.
[01:54:43.419 --> 01:54:51.245]  It's a blend of salt, palmetto, lycopene, plant sterols, zinc, vitamin D3, selenium, copper, many other key ingredients.
[01:54:51.385 --> 01:54:58.110]  And of course, you can get that now, 15% off, plus an additional 10% off if you choose auto-ship before checkout.
[01:54:58.670 --> 01:55:06.918]  So make sure that you check auto ship and you can save an additional 10% that'd be 25% off of Prostagard while supplies last.
[01:55:07.298 --> 01:55:10.441]  And we do have a two sales that are ending today.
[01:55:10.481 --> 01:55:19.189]  We have the 24-hour flash sale on storable foods, InfoWars Life Select storable foods, 30 to 40% off retail and free shipping.
[01:55:19.409 --> 01:55:30.378]  If you have an order that's $50 or more, again, that's 30 to 40% off storable food, and we have the AnthroPlex introductory cell extended for just one more day.
[01:55:30.458 --> 01:55:33.380]  It had ended yesterday, but it was so popular we extended it for one more day.
[01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:36.763]  Again, that is AnthroPlex along with Supermail Vitality.
[01:55:37.123 --> 01:55:41.067]  You can get those two together for 15% off and free shipping on that as well.
[01:55:41.167 --> 01:55:47.332]  Both of those cells, AnthroPlex and the storable food, both of those end today.
[01:55:48.493 --> 01:55:49.393]  Vermin Supreme.
[01:55:49.433 --> 01:55:50.814]  This is the guy who campaigns.
[01:55:50.834 --> 01:55:55.116]  He's got a large, long beard and he has a big boot on his head.
[01:55:55.176 --> 01:55:56.977]  And we were just talking about waterboarding.
[01:55:57.758 --> 01:56:04.381]  He asked Senator Ted Cruz, another proponent of waterboarding, because all the Republicans support waterboarding.
[01:56:04.421 --> 01:56:06.642]  They all want to be tougher than the next guy.
[01:56:06.702 --> 01:56:07.503]  And let me tell you what.
[01:56:08.163 --> 01:56:10.685]  The problem is not with the candidates.
[01:56:10.905 --> 01:56:13.768]  The problem is with the Republicans who vote for him.
[01:56:14.048 --> 01:56:17.771]  They're telling you that because they know that you want that.
[01:56:18.252 --> 01:56:21.214]  They know you want terrorists waterboard.
[01:56:21.595 --> 01:56:23.416]  And you don't know who the terrorists are.
[01:56:23.456 --> 01:56:24.257]  You don't really care.
[01:56:24.537 --> 01:56:25.558]  Just point a guy out.
[01:56:25.598 --> 01:56:27.660]  If the government says it's a terrorist, get tough with him.
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:28.541]  Waterboard him.
[01:56:28.661 --> 01:56:29.521]  Do whatever you have to.
[01:56:30.342 --> 01:56:32.784]  You are the ones who are driving this.
[01:56:33.184 --> 01:56:37.846]  You are the ones who are encouraging this from the government, from these candidates.
[01:56:37.866 --> 01:56:39.868]  And so they're all saying, yeah, we'll do the waterboarding for you.
[01:56:39.908 --> 01:56:41.349]  Sure, we'll be tougher than the next guy.
[01:56:41.749 --> 01:56:44.230]  So what he did was he asked Ted Cruz a question about waterboarding.
[01:56:44.590 --> 01:56:48.813]  He said, should the water used in waterboarding be fluoridated?
[01:56:51.049 --> 01:56:52.750]  There you go, that's Vermin Supreme.
[01:56:52.790 --> 01:57:02.615]  Now, he's running not as a Republican, he's running as a Democrat, and like a good Democrat, he has promised a free pony for every American, just as you would expect a Democrat to, okay?
[01:57:03.335 --> 01:57:05.136]  And mandatory toothbrushing laws.
[01:57:06.197 --> 01:57:11.119]  I don't really, I think he's basically stolen the campaign of Michael Bloomberg.
[01:57:11.339 --> 01:57:14.221]  If Bloomberg gets in the race, I expect him to do exactly the same thing.
[01:57:14.881 --> 01:57:16.762]  Absolutely, the mandatory toothbrush laws.
[01:57:16.802 --> 01:57:22.065]  You may or may not get your free pony from Mayor Bloomberg, but here's the interesting thing out of New Hampshire.
[01:57:22.785 --> 01:57:30.349]  Vermin Supreme, and again he's a performance artist, he looks like a wizard, he's got a boot on his head, okay, he's been doing this for 30 some odd years.
[01:57:30.850 --> 01:57:32.591]  Guess what?
[01:57:32.631 --> 01:57:33.671]  He got 240 votes.
[01:57:34.352 --> 01:57:38.554]  He got twice as many votes as former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore.
[01:57:39.895 --> 01:57:40.935]  Who is still in the race!
[01:57:41.295 --> 01:57:42.216]  He hasn't dropped out.
[01:57:42.496 --> 01:57:47.197]  He got half the votes of Vermin Supreme, and Jim Gilmore has not dropped out.
[01:57:47.317 --> 01:57:49.658]  I mean, at least Carly Fiorina did.
[01:57:49.978 --> 01:57:53.519]  But, uh, Jim Gilmore just keeps going and going and going.
[01:57:53.539 --> 01:57:54.560]  He's the Energizer Bunny.
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:56.980]  And we look at Hillary Clinton.
[01:57:57.561 --> 01:57:58.021]  Let me, uh...
[01:57:58.882 --> 01:58:01.164]  We have the story up on Infowars.com today.
[01:58:01.204 --> 01:58:04.567]  New emails show the press is literally taking orders from Hillary.
[01:58:05.108 --> 01:58:15.478]  Yeah, she dictated to the political editor of The Atlantic, said, I will give you, and there's back and forth, there's emails that were discovered by Gawker doing a FOIA request.
[01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:20.122]  And this is why they don't want these emails released, okay?
[01:58:20.322 --> 01:58:24.703]  It's not just the criminal indictments, they don't want you to see how she's blackmailing people.
[01:58:25.044 --> 01:58:33.887]  She blackmailed this editor and said, you're going to have to use the exact words that I want you to use to describe the speech if you want to see an advanced transcript of it.
[01:58:34.407 --> 01:58:40.530]  Interestingly enough, the word that they wanted to use to describe her speech was muscular.
[01:58:41.190 --> 01:58:41.670]  Muscular?
[01:58:42.491 --> 01:58:44.191]  That's what she was muscling this guy about.
[01:58:44.231 --> 01:58:45.192]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:58:50.305 --> 01:58:52.125]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:00:01.661 --> 02:00:07.907]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:18.716 --> 02:00:22.640]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:23.540 --> 02:00:28.525]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.119 --> 02:00:34.541]  Welcome back to the third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:34.581 --> 02:00:39.024]  In this hour, we're going to be talking to, in the next segment actually coming up, we're going to be talking to Brad Dacus.
[02:00:39.725 --> 02:00:51.274]  He is the founder and president of the Pacific Justice Institute, and we're going to be talking to him about the attempt by the city of San Diego to ban the term Founding Fathers.
[02:00:51.794 --> 02:00:59.019]  And of course, after he sent them a letter and it got some exposure in the press, everybody was absolutely amazed.
[02:00:59.059 --> 02:01:00.621]  And here we are, just before Presidents Day,
[02:01:01.261 --> 02:01:06.746]  And the city of San Diego, out of political correctness, is going to ban the term founding father.
[02:01:06.766 --> 02:01:13.151]  So we're going to talk to him about the victory, because they backed down when people shined the light on that absurdity.
[02:01:13.191 --> 02:01:16.093]  But we're going to just talk about political correctness in general.
[02:01:16.473 --> 02:01:23.039]  Also, his institute defends religious liberties and parental rights, so we're going to talk to him about other issues involving that as well.
[02:01:24.147 --> 02:01:46.463]  Now, as I was talking about before we went to the break, Hillary Clinton's emails that were obtained by a Freedom of Request action with Gawker showed that they were blackmailing journalists, telling them, we'll give you access, we'll give you advanced transcripts so that you can get a scoop on other people, but we're going to tell you how to describe the speech.
[02:01:47.324 --> 02:01:48.125]  Pretty amazing.
[02:01:49.225 --> 02:01:55.389]  I think it's things like that that Hillary Clinton is fighting so hard to cover up with this email scandal.
[02:01:55.810 --> 02:01:58.011]  But then there's another story that was very interesting.
[02:01:58.071 --> 02:02:01.193]  This is from Jerome Corsi at WND.
[02:02:01.554 --> 02:02:07.017]  He says the Sanders ground game is being led by the Soros garbage man.
[02:02:07.177 --> 02:02:08.938]  This is somebody that's worked for George Soros.
[02:02:09.019 --> 02:02:12.501]  It's somebody that George W. Bush called the garbage man.
[02:02:12.741 --> 02:02:15.923]  And that has nothing to do with garbage.
[02:02:16.303 --> 02:02:16.664]  It's just
[02:02:17.624 --> 02:02:18.385]  It's just the Bushes.
[02:02:18.405 --> 02:02:20.926]  You've got to understand, it's not going to make any sense.
[02:02:21.246 --> 02:02:23.067]  It's just their inarticulate rage.
[02:02:23.788 --> 02:02:24.828]  Jeb has the same problem.
[02:02:24.848 --> 02:02:30.691]  But anyway, he hacked Bush's 2000 presidential campaign website, so W called him the garbage man.
[02:02:30.711 --> 02:02:32.412]  This guy's name is Zach Exley.
[02:02:33.073 --> 02:02:35.174]  What I found was interesting on this is that
[02:02:36.212 --> 02:02:45.998]  Bernie Sanders, who's put out there as Mr. Squeaky Clean, he would never do anything dirty, he's hired this labor union organizer and computer hacker to run his ground game, okay?
[02:02:46.018 --> 02:02:48.699]  And here's where it also gets even more interesting.
[02:02:49.179 --> 02:03:00.646]  Many within the Clinton camp suspect that this guy, this hacker, Zack Exley, is connected to the international network of computer hackers that exposed Clinton's private email server in 2013.
[02:03:00.706 --> 02:03:02.507]  This is where it all began.
[02:03:03.067 --> 02:03:13.434]  So now Sanders has hired the guy who made her private email server public and hacked into it and put this stuff out here and started the whole ball rolling.
[02:03:13.914 --> 02:03:14.455]  How about that?
[02:03:14.515 --> 02:03:15.375]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:03:16.076 --> 02:03:20.679]  Mr. Simon and Garfunkel has hired this guy here.
[02:03:21.519 --> 02:03:26.883]  Anyway, looking at some of the other things that are coming out of the election campaign, we see that Rupert Murdoch
[02:03:27.739 --> 02:03:29.120]  He's very angry at Chris Christie.
[02:03:29.540 --> 02:03:31.501]  He calls him a suicide bomber.
[02:03:31.921 --> 02:03:33.842]  He said, Chris Christie, suicide bomber.
[02:03:33.882 --> 02:03:34.582]  He tweeted this out.
[02:03:35.002 --> 02:03:37.624]  He damages the victim while blowing himself up.
[02:03:37.764 --> 02:03:39.064]  Ooh, I guess he's a terrorist.
[02:03:39.284 --> 02:03:44.367]  I guess we should lock up Chris Christie because Rupert Murdoch calls him a suicide bomber terrorist.
[02:03:44.767 --> 02:03:50.970]  Actually, you know what he did was he just blew up Fox News' favorite wind-up toy, Marco Rubato.
[02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:59.098]  And as we look at them heading towards South Carolina, it's pretty interesting looking at the various headlines.
[02:03:59.499 --> 02:04:05.005]  We've got Rubio attacking Trump, Trump attacking Jeb, Jeb attacking Rubio.
[02:04:05.025 --> 02:04:08.769]  I mean, it's like they're circling the guns, they're firing at each other.
[02:04:09.190 --> 02:04:11.692]  It is going to get pretty rough in South Carolina.
[02:04:11.772 --> 02:04:12.794]  And South Carolina
[02:04:13.354 --> 02:04:17.457]  has a very rough heritage when it comes to dirty tricks.
[02:04:17.637 --> 02:04:19.539]  It's the land of dirty tricks.
[02:04:19.959 --> 02:04:24.943]  There's an article that was up on the Drudge Report earlier from Politico warning the dirty tricks are about to start.
[02:04:24.983 --> 02:04:30.267]  They point out that the Charleston Post and Courier has set up a whisperer campaign.
[02:04:30.707 --> 02:04:36.371]  It's a digital tool that begs the public to help to keep tabs on the coming blizzard of dirty tricks.
[02:04:36.752 --> 02:04:40.875]  They know it's going to be happening in South Carolina because, look, we got things like
[02:04:41.255 --> 02:04:48.818]  Remember when John McCain, just before, just before the election, they did these push telephone polls telling everybody he had an illegitimate child?
[02:04:49.138 --> 02:04:53.600]  Then they had the bogus Mitt Romney Christmas cards with controversial quotes from the Book of Mormon.
[02:04:53.980 --> 02:04:58.822]  Okay, you have flyers dropped on people's doorsteps telling them to vote on the wrong day.
[02:04:59.283 --> 02:05:00.263]  That's South Carolina!
[02:05:00.483 --> 02:05:01.804]  That's Lindsey Graham land!
[02:05:02.144 --> 02:05:04.505]  That's Jeb Bush's good buddy, Lindsey Graham!
[02:05:04.545 --> 02:05:06.085]  That's the way they play ball down there.
[02:05:06.126 --> 02:05:07.726]  It's gonna get really nasty.
[02:05:07.746 --> 02:05:09.527]  A lot of ad hominem attacks coming up.
[02:05:09.727 --> 02:05:20.098]  Socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is having breakfast in Harlem this morning with former coke dealer and FBI informant Reverend Al Sharpton.
[02:05:20.418 --> 02:05:32.411]  Sanders is hoping for an endorsement from Sharpton and hopes that it will boost his reputation among young black voters, who according to recent poll numbers overwhelmingly support Hillary Clinton.
[02:05:32.631 --> 02:05:44.137]  This morning's meeting with the Reverend Al is at Sylvia's Restaurant, the very same place that Barack Obama sat down with a preacher in 2008, and they've since become very close friends.
[02:05:44.637 --> 02:05:55.443]  In fact, Al Sharpton has somehow managed to get away with owing $4 million in back taxes to the IRS, perhaps because of his cozy relationship with the President.
[02:05:55.723 --> 02:05:57.444]  So how ironic is this?
[02:05:57.964 --> 02:06:04.809]  Bernie Sanders, a guy who wants to raise taxes, is having breakfast with a guy who doesn't pay them.
[02:06:05.649 --> 02:06:08.752]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.

[02:08:37.084 --> 02:08:39.369]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:44.787 --> 02:08:50.731]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, and in this segment we're going to be joined by Brad Dacus.
[02:08:51.332 --> 02:08:54.754]  He's the founder and president of the Pacific Justice Institute.
[02:08:54.774 --> 02:08:57.016]  He's been the legislative assistant to U.S.
[02:08:57.156 --> 02:09:00.979]  Senator Phil Graham, a graduate of the Texas Law School here.
[02:09:02.006 --> 02:09:06.349]  And now he is working to defend religious liberty and parental rights.
[02:09:06.749 --> 02:09:17.115]  His efforts to stop the banishing of the term founding fathers in San Diego just came out the last couple of days and they had a victory on this.
[02:09:17.176 --> 02:09:22.579]  I want to talk to him about that, about the other things that he works on with religious liberties and parental rights.
[02:09:23.039 --> 02:09:26.862]  And let me break down the story for you real quickly before we get him on.
[02:09:27.782 --> 02:09:41.090]  It was reported by WND, I think they were the first ones to break this a couple of days ago, that the city of San Diego had put out a new guidelines for their employees saying that you can't utter the phrase, uh, founding fathers.
[02:09:41.130 --> 02:09:45.093]  They had a lot of other things in their bias free language guide.
[02:09:45.113 --> 02:09:51.277]  They had things like, uh, the common man, mankind, man made, man up.
[02:09:51.937 --> 02:09:54.318]  Those are things that they had in their manual.
[02:09:54.979 --> 02:09:55.499]  Can I say that?
[02:09:55.519 --> 02:09:56.560]  Can I say manual?
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:09:57.320]  I don't know.
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:09:58.741]  It's got the word man in it.
[02:09:59.221 --> 02:10:01.523]  And they said that this is their bias-free language.
[02:10:01.743 --> 02:10:02.363]  Let me tell you something.
[02:10:02.483 --> 02:10:04.724]  They've got a bias problem themselves.
[02:10:04.764 --> 02:10:09.307]  They seem to be obsessed with the term man, anything that is masculine.
[02:10:09.327 --> 02:10:17.712]  So let's get the comments from Brad Dacus, president of the Pacific Justice Institute, who fired off a letter and we got some results from that.
[02:10:18.192 --> 02:10:19.473]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Dacus.
[02:10:20.721 --> 02:10:21.421]  My pleasure, Alex.
[02:10:21.501 --> 02:10:22.422]  Thanks for the opportunity.
[02:10:23.362 --> 02:10:35.686]  We had, Alex isn't here, I'm David, but it was interesting when you talked about this, you said if you can't utter the phrase founding fathers without losing your job when you work for the government, it's a sad day for free speech.
[02:10:35.726 --> 02:10:40.968]  And of course their timing was extremely bad as well, coming just a couple of days before President's Day.
[02:10:42.649 --> 02:10:44.629]  Yeah, this is terrible timing.
[02:10:45.330 --> 02:10:49.211]  You know, here we're about to recognize the founding fathers and
[02:10:49.995 --> 02:10:59.242]  Uh, and for the sacrifice that they put forth so we have our constitutional freedoms and our constitutional rights, like the First Amendment, free speech.
[02:10:59.883 --> 02:11:08.409]  And at the same time here, they're coming out with this kind of policy to prohibition of speech, including the term founding fathers.
[02:11:09.076 --> 02:11:11.877]  Of course, we at Pacific Justice, we saw this for what it was.
[02:11:12.297 --> 02:11:19.479]  We sent a demand letter to the city, and we're glad that they have rescinded that prohibition on mentioning the term Founding Fathers.
[02:11:19.499 --> 02:11:19.960]  That's good.
[02:11:19.980 --> 02:11:23.821]  But if you alluded to... It's amazing that you've got to do that, right?
[02:11:23.881 --> 02:11:30.743]  You wouldn't think... It's kind of insane that you would have to send them a letter and say, you know what, you shouldn't try to ban the term Founding Fathers.
[02:11:30.783 --> 02:11:34.324]  But that's the kind of insane society that we live in now, isn't it?
[02:11:34.424 --> 02:11:34.985]  Oh, it is.
[02:11:35.065 --> 02:11:35.905]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[02:11:36.744 --> 02:11:42.953]  More than 1,500 court decisions where the phrase Founding Fathers has been mentioned.
[02:11:43.634 --> 02:11:52.547]  And to treat it like some kind of a cuss word is really, I don't know how to say it, twisted.
[02:11:53.689 --> 02:11:56.050]  And yet, this was being implemented.
[02:11:56.090 --> 02:11:59.452]  This wasn't just a hypothetical idea.
[02:11:59.832 --> 02:12:04.774]  This was in writing, and the director was given to all employees.
[02:12:05.275 --> 02:12:07.155]  And if they didn't comply, they could lose their job.
[02:12:07.176 --> 02:12:09.136]  That's right, that was in their manual.
[02:12:09.437 --> 02:12:11.978]  Do they have a different term for the term manual?
[02:12:12.018 --> 02:12:15.459]  Because I find that offensive, it's got the term man in it.
[02:12:15.940 --> 02:12:18.501]  Haven't they come up with a gender neutral term for manual?
[02:12:19.525 --> 02:12:21.565]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[02:12:21.685 --> 02:12:23.766]  I see the hypocrisy right there.
[02:12:23.806 --> 02:12:26.386]  It's very ironic.
[02:12:26.946 --> 02:12:28.527]  Man-made, man-up, mankind.
[02:12:28.567 --> 02:12:30.047]  They can't talk about any of that stuff.
[02:12:30.287 --> 02:12:31.267]  I mean, it's insane.
[02:12:31.527 --> 02:12:32.407]  Yeah.
[02:12:32.447 --> 02:12:47.570]  And also, I think people need to understand as far as, you know, rationally why it makes no sense is if they look at the Webster's Dictionary and how these words are defined, they're not defined in the sense of exclusively to one gender or the other.
[02:12:48.050 --> 02:12:48.870]  They never have been.
[02:12:49.705 --> 02:12:54.827]  And yet they're trying to read something into a word that's not there.
[02:12:55.568 --> 02:12:58.909]  So it's really sort of an obsession.
[02:12:58.989 --> 02:12:59.710]  It's almost a...
[02:13:00.886 --> 02:13:04.590]  I think that maybe counseling is needed.
[02:13:04.870 --> 02:13:08.153]  Quite clearly is an obsession and it is a political tool.
[02:13:08.213 --> 02:13:24.848]  I mean we just saw this last week we had Gloria Steinem, we had Madeleine Albright come out and do what Ann Taylor Fleming writing for Reuters said was vote shaming, slut shaming and said that it was essentially the same thing saying if you don't support Hillary Clinton
[02:13:25.548 --> 02:13:39.394]  You're not a real feminist, you have betrayed women and so forth and so on, and make all kinds of insinuations about people supporting Bernie Sanders because they wanted to get dates with young boys, things like that.
[02:13:39.434 --> 02:13:43.755]  I mean, just shaming them over their political choice within the Democrat Party.
[02:13:44.176 --> 02:13:50.338]  It is a political tactic, it is a tool used to control people, and we need to understand that.
[02:13:50.378 --> 02:13:52.159]  I mean, it's not an idiotic obsession.
[02:13:52.739 --> 02:13:59.584]  John Cleese was talking about how you could no longer criticize anybody, and it was a shame because that's the essence of comedy.
[02:13:59.644 --> 02:14:02.666]  Comedy is always going to have some kind of implied criticism with people.
[02:14:03.147 --> 02:14:08.110]  And he said, you know, there's kind of a psychological condition about it, but it's not just a psychological condition.
[02:14:08.591 --> 02:14:11.092]  It is a tool of social control.
[02:14:11.192 --> 02:14:15.215]  It is a tool of, kind of a Marxist tool of social control, isn't it?
[02:14:16.636 --> 02:14:17.737]  It really is.
[02:14:17.977 --> 02:14:20.019]  If government can control
[02:14:20.759 --> 02:14:22.800]  The speech of man and women.
[02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:29.103]  If government can control this, they control what we think.
[02:14:29.123 --> 02:14:33.985]  If they can control what we speak, they can control what we think and our program.
[02:14:34.205 --> 02:14:36.346]  You know, I've read the book 1984.
[02:14:36.386 --> 02:14:44.410]  I never thought we'd become as close as we are today to that book, and yet that kind of control is what we see taking place.
[02:14:45.230 --> 02:14:49.112]  Like the city of San Diego trying to implement these outrageous policies.
[02:14:49.522 --> 02:14:53.845]  And it's pages and pages of control with regard to what can be said and what can't be.
[02:14:54.546 --> 02:15:01.932]  I think a policy addressing harassment, that's fine, where you're deliberately saying something to someone to put them down.
[02:15:02.392 --> 02:15:02.732]  Fine.
[02:15:03.273 --> 02:15:17.724]  But what we get is so obsessive about this, this kind of, I don't know how to describe it, thinking that individuals can't say words because of a meaning that someone else has that they never intended.
[02:15:18.862 --> 02:15:21.024]  That's really a very sick part of our society.
[02:15:21.044 --> 02:15:34.694]  You know, I thought it was interesting, Mr. Dacus, when they came back and you wrote them the letter and said, you know, essentially pointing this out to the mayor and the mayor said, oh, yes, I really don't support that.
[02:15:34.754 --> 02:15:35.735]  We're not going to do that.
[02:15:36.215 --> 02:15:46.363]  And then they had a spokesperson, city spokeswoman Katie Keech said, no employee has ever been disciplined for referencing our founding fathers and no one ever will.
[02:15:47.381 --> 02:15:53.164]  But then, why would they put out this bias-free manual if they didn't intend to do that?
[02:15:53.384 --> 02:15:55.225]  I mean, that begs the whole issue.
[02:15:55.265 --> 02:15:58.787]  They're pretending as if this never happened because they got caught on it.
[02:15:58.827 --> 02:15:59.587]  They got called on it.
[02:15:59.888 --> 02:16:00.108]  Right.
[02:16:00.648 --> 02:16:00.848]  Right.
[02:16:01.088 --> 02:16:02.009]  It's in black and white.
[02:16:02.689 --> 02:16:06.971]  The prohibition regarding founding fathers, it's in black and white on their letterhead.
[02:16:06.991 --> 02:16:12.174]  You know, they're trying to see some pushback.
[02:16:12.954 --> 02:16:14.015]  I'm glad there's pushback.
[02:16:14.882 --> 02:16:19.928]  But that just shows you why we need to be very sensitive to call it out when we see it.
[02:16:20.849 --> 02:16:29.979]  Otherwise, this would have been implemented and with regard to all the employees working for the City of San Diego, that's very disturbing.
[02:16:30.305 --> 02:16:31.666]  Yeah, and it's a very large group of people.
[02:16:32.126 --> 02:16:40.270]  Let's talk about kids now as well, because I noticed that one of the things that you do at the Pacific Justice Institute, you say you defend religious liberties and parental rights.
[02:16:40.290 --> 02:16:45.433]  You mentioned Orwell, and we do live in an increasingly Orwellian world.
[02:16:45.453 --> 02:16:49.935]  There was an article by New American, Big Brother is seeking to get into your child's head, literally.
[02:16:50.635 --> 02:16:55.760]  And they point out an article from Education Week where they're advocating the idea that U.S.
[02:16:55.800 --> 02:17:13.595]  Department of Education and other federal agencies would use emerging technologies to monitor and track everything from a child's mindset to their attitudes, to their emotions, to their cognitive processes, all under the pretext of educating them.
[02:17:13.635 --> 02:17:17.798]  Of course, they're going to target all these emotions, processes, mindsets,
[02:17:18.619 --> 02:17:22.402]  Map their personality traits and keep track of that.
[02:17:22.442 --> 02:17:25.424]  I mean, that is about as Orwellian as it gets.
[02:17:25.605 --> 02:17:26.145]  Your comments.
[02:17:27.626 --> 02:17:27.926]  Oh, yeah.
[02:17:27.966 --> 02:17:33.791]  When people first hear that, their first reaction is usually like, OK, this is some kind of conspiracy thing.
[02:17:33.831 --> 02:17:37.394]  It's, you know, no, it is not a conspiracy thing.
[02:17:37.714 --> 02:17:38.635]  It's right.
[02:17:38.695 --> 02:17:41.697]  It's laid out for implementation.
[02:17:41.757 --> 02:17:47.602]  And it's some are using it as a part of Common Core and that whole big picture, if you will.
[02:17:48.388 --> 02:17:49.769]  Uh, it's very real.
[02:17:49.789 --> 02:18:07.580]  Uh, I know that, you know, personally, I was in court, uh, just, uh, about 15 years ago in the state of California to get four judges to grant injunctions against the state of California to protect parents wanting to opt in children out of a new test that would, that delves into psychology and the psyche of kids.
[02:18:07.701 --> 02:18:09.422]  And it would be reviewed by everyone.
[02:18:09.442 --> 02:18:16.006]  I would have the access would be accessible to social workers to determine which children they needed to focus on, which families they needed to
[02:18:16.753 --> 02:18:17.293]  I think so.
[02:18:31.158 --> 02:18:35.600]  Being implemented on an institutional basis from K-12, that's very serious.
[02:18:48.086 --> 02:18:52.208]  They want to dismiss that as paranoid, and yet it's the government itself that is paranoid.
[02:18:52.608 --> 02:18:56.970]  It's the government itself that wants to know everything about everyone, and to record that.
[02:18:56.990 --> 02:19:05.615]  I mean, the biggest area of intelligence that's growing, that James Clapper's been involved with for a long time, is geospatial intelligence, and part of that
[02:19:06.295 --> 02:19:08.696]  Is to map the human domain.
[02:19:08.736 --> 02:19:11.218]  We've been talking about this since Operation Jade Helm.
[02:19:11.618 --> 02:19:12.919]  Human domain analytics.
[02:19:12.959 --> 02:19:24.445]  They want to go in and map people's religious beliefs, their political beliefs, look at their activity, and keep track of that, map that out, so they know everything that everyone is doing.
[02:19:24.485 --> 02:19:27.787]  I mean, if that's not paranoid and over-the-top, nothing is.
[02:19:28.047 --> 02:19:29.468]  And that's the reality of this.
[02:19:29.928 --> 02:19:33.510]  I mean, they want to say that people who are concerned about that, that we're the paranoid ones.
[02:19:33.550 --> 02:19:34.751]  No, it's the government!
[02:19:35.091 --> 02:19:35.814]  That is paranoid.
[02:19:35.855 --> 02:19:39.068]  It's the government that has to know and control everyone.
[02:19:41.300 --> 02:19:42.300]  Exactly.
[02:19:42.821 --> 02:19:57.044]  We've seen that being implemented through public education, you know, training teachers on how to placate religious people, how to identify students who come from intolerant families.
[02:19:58.285 --> 02:19:59.505]  Hold it right there, Mr. Dacus.
[02:19:59.545 --> 02:20:00.945]  We've got to take a commercial break.
[02:20:00.965 --> 02:20:04.826]  We're going to come right back with Brad Dacus, Pacific Justice Institute.
[02:20:04.846 --> 02:20:07.107]  We're going to talk to him about some of the other cases that he's on.
[02:20:07.127 --> 02:20:07.707]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:09.853 --> 02:20:11.353]  Are you looking to sell body armor?

[02:21:40.583 --> 02:21:42.704]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.

[02:21:47.785 --> 02:21:49.425]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[02:21:49.465 --> 02:21:50.965]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:21:51.085 --> 02:21:54.306]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:21:54.566 --> 02:21:56.386]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:21:56.546 --> 02:21:57.447]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:21:57.467 --> 02:21:58.427]  It doesn't have garbage in it.

[02:22:24.635 --> 02:22:26.456]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[02:22:26.796 --> 02:22:32.238]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:22:32.418 --> 02:22:42.201]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:22:42.441 --> 02:22:48.683]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:22:48.923 --> 02:22:52.244]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[02:22:52.264 --> 02:22:54.105]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:22:54.345 --> 02:22:57.446]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:22:57.486 --> 02:22:59.607]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[02:23:08.849 --> 02:23:10.850]  Paid for by Bonner and Partners, an independent research firm.
[02:23:11.230 --> 02:23:20.653]  Fed up after years spent fighting big government in Washington, D.C., a multi-millionaire businessman has spent the last 30 years tracking an obscure threat to America.
[02:23:20.913 --> 02:23:24.595]  Today, he says it's about to reach a sudden and disturbing conclusion.
[02:23:24.855 --> 02:23:28.216]  If he's right, your way of life is about to change very suddenly.
[02:23:28.576 --> 02:23:33.238]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit, to your retirement, and the family you want to protect.
[02:23:33.639 --> 02:23:35.559]  Now, he's made predictions like this before.
[02:23:35.820 --> 02:23:37.240]  And he was right then, too.
[02:23:37.680 --> 02:23:40.482]  A few years ago, he warned that housing prices would collapse.
[02:23:40.822 --> 02:23:41.282]  They did.
[02:23:41.642 --> 02:23:44.463]  Before that, he warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[02:23:44.883 --> 02:23:45.384]  They did.
[02:23:45.704 --> 02:23:47.805]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[02:23:48.065 --> 02:23:50.386]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[02:23:50.746 --> 02:23:52.128]  This will affect us all.
[02:23:52.388 --> 02:23:57.853]  A free video he's released online details everything you need to know at dollardownfall.com.
[02:23:58.134 --> 02:24:03.939]  Now maybe you'll disagree with his conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.
[02:24:04.340 --> 02:24:06.262]  Just go to dollardownfall.com.
[02:24:06.482 --> 02:24:08.244]  That's dollardownfall.com.
[02:24:27.105 --> 02:24:28.365]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:28.445 --> 02:24:30.246]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to Brad Dekus.
[02:24:30.306 --> 02:24:33.747]  He is the founder and president of the Pacific Justice Institute.
[02:24:34.527 --> 02:24:44.990]  He saw that San Diego, the city of San Diego, put out a new manual and I hesitate to use that word because they're trying to purge the term man out of everything.
[02:24:45.690 --> 02:24:50.931]  They wanted to purge the term founding fathers, so he sent them a letter and they backed down.
[02:24:50.951 --> 02:24:53.552]  You know, when you shine daylight on these people,
[02:24:54.372 --> 02:24:58.113]  They will back down from the absurdity, but they just keep coming.
[02:24:58.153 --> 02:25:03.295]  So in this segment I want to ask Mr. Dacus about some of the other cases that he's involved with.
[02:25:03.335 --> 02:25:07.876]  He defends the religious liberties and parental rights with the Pacific Justice Institute.
[02:25:07.896 --> 02:25:12.537]  Mr. Dacus, tell us about some of the other cases that you've been involved in recently here.
[02:25:13.778 --> 02:25:14.638]  Oh sure, you bet.
[02:25:15.278 --> 02:25:18.219]  Right now we're defending a church in San Francisco.
[02:25:18.928 --> 02:25:19.288]  I think so.
[02:25:39.313 --> 02:25:51.600]  When they're being threatened from being able to build somewhere, grow somewhere, we see the number one curtailment of church growth in America today is not lack of members or money, but it's actually local government saying, we don't want you anywhere.
[02:25:51.620 --> 02:25:54.362]  And that's something that we're really addressing firmly.
[02:25:54.402 --> 02:25:56.583]  We had a big Ninth Circuit victory not too long ago.
[02:25:57.130 --> 02:25:58.631]  Yeah, I've seen that many times.
[02:25:58.671 --> 02:26:08.981]  I mean, when we look at these cases of eminent domain for private use, in most of these cases that I've noticed, they typically go after a church because they feel like they're easy pickings.
[02:26:09.081 --> 02:26:14.907]  I remember a case out in California where they had a church and they wanted to take their property.
[02:26:16.028 --> 02:26:25.294]  Take them off the property and give it to Costco and of course the justification was what we always see with these Kello V London type cases saying well Costco can generate more tax revenue than the church can.
[02:26:25.334 --> 02:26:32.718]  Well quite obviously they can because the church isn't being taxed but nevertheless they become the targets of these eminent domain cases.
[02:26:34.199 --> 02:26:40.103]  Oh exactly and it's it's a real atrocity to religious freedom and equal treatment.
[02:26:40.844 --> 02:26:42.565]  Another classic example of
[02:26:43.140 --> 02:26:55.067]  Violation of the rights of individuals and a true free libertarian society is a law in California and that has actually gone into effect also in Illinois and New Jersey actually.
[02:26:55.087 --> 02:27:04.693]  Governor of New Jersey signed this law and what it does is it bans anyone under the age of 18 who's struggling with same-sex attraction or gender identity dysphoria.
[02:27:05.334 --> 02:27:08.816]  It prohibits them from getting any kind of counseling that in any way
[02:27:09.443 --> 02:27:09.803]  I don't know.
[02:27:36.418 --> 02:27:45.066]  To be able to meet the individual needs of their individual clients who wish to have that kind of counseling in alignment with their beliefs and their faith.
[02:27:45.466 --> 02:27:53.374]  It's amazing that the government would think that they should interject themselves into a medical issue, into a family issue like that, especially for a minor.
[02:27:54.655 --> 02:28:01.521]  Right, exactly, and unfortunately the other states are very tolerant and let parents and families and individuals
[02:28:02.085 --> 02:28:08.010]  It's the kind of counseling that they feel they need and is warranted based on the individual needs of that client.
[02:28:08.451 --> 02:28:12.734]  But it's just a very heavy-handed control that is very intimidating.
[02:28:12.754 --> 02:28:29.029]  Another area of control we're dealing with, we're litigating, is dealing with boys being required to be able to go into girls' locker rooms and shower with the girls at all public schools, senior high schools in California.
[02:28:29.833 --> 02:28:33.195]  Uh, you know, of course, they're trying to address the, uh, gender identity dysphoria.
[02:28:33.235 --> 02:28:51.327]  If a boy feels like inside, he feels like he's a girl, they're saying, okay, then he can not just have a separate place to shower and change, but actually use the locker room and the showers at the same time as the opposite biological sex, disregarding the privacy rights of these 13, 14 year old girls.
[02:28:52.067 --> 02:28:54.609]  Uh, and, and, and the implications, it's very, very twisted.
[02:28:55.229 --> 02:28:58.171]  And once again, it's, it's the big heavy hand of state government.
[02:28:58.866 --> 02:28:59.106]  Okay.
[02:29:09.315 --> 02:29:09.655]  All right.
[02:29:29.369 --> 02:29:40.436]  But most of the rest of the people are getting this kind of brave new world conditioning and of course it focuses on that kind of sexualization to keep them subdued, keep them confused.
[02:29:40.816 --> 02:29:45.999]  You've got your hands full being on the Pacific West Coast because that's where things are so crazy.
[02:29:46.019 --> 02:29:47.160]  We're talking to Brad Dacus.
[02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:48.881]  Thank you so much for joining us, Mr. Dacus.
[02:29:49.261 --> 02:29:53.003]  Pacific Justice Institute, you can find them at pji.org.
[02:29:53.063 --> 02:29:54.444]  Thank you so much for the work that you do.
[02:29:59.067 --> 02:30:02.072]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.013 --> 02:30:05.698]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.895 --> 02:30:14.838]  Top story on Drudge Report this morning, gold surges to one year high on fears of financial uncertainty.
[02:30:15.038 --> 02:30:19.480]  That's right, spot gold has surged nearly 4% to $1,240 an ounce.
[02:30:19.761 --> 02:30:25.104]  It's highest since February 2015, and it's on track for its biggest daily rise since December 1st, 2014.
[02:30:25.424 --> 02:30:34.989]  The rise in gold is being triggered by financial instability fears that are fueled by European bank shares slumping to multi-year lows, with concerns mounting over banks' profitability and a low growth
[02:30:35.189 --> 02:30:36.450]  Low interest rate environment.
[02:30:36.570 --> 02:30:43.895]  Analyst Matthew Turner said, Investors are concerned that Central Bank's solution is negative interest rates or at least not rising rates, and that is gold friendly.
[02:30:44.135 --> 02:30:49.518]  James Butterfield added, Investors are returning to gold as a core diversifier and safe haven investment.
[02:30:49.659 --> 02:30:54.141]  Given the increasingly challenging investment and economic environment, we expect this trend to continue.
[02:30:54.382 --> 02:30:57.324]  Silver is also experiencing a surge, jumping nearly 2% to $15.60 an ounce.
[02:30:59.685 --> 02:31:00.667]  It's high since November 2015.
[02:31:01.147 --> 02:31:06.075]  A year ago at this time, silver was hovering nearly $17.50 an ounce.
[02:31:06.456 --> 02:31:09.340]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:31:11.031 --> 02:31:14.453]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:31:14.814 --> 02:31:21.938]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:31:22.539 --> 02:31:30.884]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:31:31.185 --> 02:31:35.327]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:31:35.588 --> 02:31:40.631]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[02:31:41.171 --> 02:31:44.993]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:31:45.413 --> 02:31:48.515]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[02:31:48.835 --> 02:31:59.901]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[02:32:21.196 --> 02:32:26.240]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:33:17.816 --> 02:33:22.710]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.652 --> 02:33:28.874]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show this February 11, 2016.
[02:33:29.675 --> 02:33:33.738]  I'm David Knight and we have just, we've got it up on Infowars.com.
[02:33:33.758 --> 02:33:40.402]  Story of the last of the four people who were at the Wildlife Refuge there in the Oregon standoff has now peacefully surrendered.
[02:33:40.442 --> 02:33:41.603]  We're glad to see that happen.
[02:33:41.703 --> 02:33:45.846]  It appeared that he was suicidal but now he has surrendered peacefully.
[02:33:45.866 --> 02:33:48.028]  I'm glad to see that peacefully resolved.
[02:33:48.068 --> 02:33:52.651]  They now need to take that into the courts because I feel these people do not deserve to be arrested.
[02:33:52.711 --> 02:33:53.912]  I think they were exercising
[02:33:54.392 --> 02:33:56.392]  Their free speech rights to protest.
[02:33:57.133 --> 02:33:58.893]  And now we will have that discussion in the course.
[02:33:58.913 --> 02:34:00.453]  I'm glad no one else has been killed.
[02:34:00.473 --> 02:34:04.794]  If you want to call in and talk about the news that we've been talking about today, I'll give you that number.
[02:34:04.874 --> 02:34:05.934]  It's 800-259-9231.

[02:34:08.555 --> 02:34:13.676]  Before I go to the calls, I want to let you know about some of the specials that we have today.
[02:34:14.076 --> 02:34:18.317]  We have a 24-hour flash sale on storable food.

[02:35:37.651 --> 02:35:41.334]  We extended the introductory sale on Anthroplex for one more day.
[02:35:41.414 --> 02:35:46.197]  Get Anthroplex and Supermail Vitality together, 15% off and free shipping.
[02:35:46.258 --> 02:35:47.719]  That definitely ends tonight.
[02:35:47.759 --> 02:35:50.320]  You can find that at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:35:52.256 --> 02:36:08.207]  As we look at some of the political news, again, we were just talking to Brad Dacus with the Pacific Justice Institute about the efforts by the city of San Diego to shut down the term Founding Fathers, also things like man-made, mankind.
[02:36:08.908 --> 02:36:15.852]  They didn't go after Manuel, okay, because the manual that they had was a bias-free manual.
[02:36:16.793 --> 02:36:17.994]  That was what was so amazing.
[02:36:18.394 --> 02:36:20.096]  Their bias was so obvious.
[02:36:20.116 --> 02:36:24.259]  They cannot abide any male terms to be used anywhere.
[02:36:24.419 --> 02:36:27.101]  But they wanted to change Founding Fathers to Founders.
[02:36:27.542 --> 02:36:36.409]  And so his organization sent a letter to them, they went public to the press, it got a lot of exposure, and the city of San Diego backed down.
[02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:42.214]  Said, no, we never really meant it, we weren't going to do anything to anybody, and it's like, oh yeah, that's why you put the manual out to do that.
[02:36:43.012 --> 02:36:48.234]  That's one of the things that Donald Trump has brought to this campaign, and we had an article about that yesterday.
[02:36:48.474 --> 02:36:55.937]  A campaign aide for the Trump campaign said that Trump has single-handedly brought back freedom of speech.
[02:36:56.337 --> 02:36:57.338]  Well, he's done a lot for it.
[02:36:57.378 --> 02:36:58.238]  We're not there yet.
[02:36:58.518 --> 02:37:04.561]  It's going to be a continuous battle, but it is great to have somebody essentially say, no, we're not going to play that game.
[02:37:04.621 --> 02:37:07.762]  Remember way back, I think it was back in August.
[02:37:08.362 --> 02:37:16.008]  There was an exchange between Donald Trump and a reporter, and the reporter called him out on the term anchor baby.
[02:37:16.168 --> 02:37:20.531]  He says, are you aware that the term anchor baby is an offensive term?
[02:37:21.051 --> 02:37:23.893]  And I guess maybe he could have said, you mean like Marco Rubio?
[02:37:24.254 --> 02:37:24.854]  He didn't say that.
[02:37:25.274 --> 02:37:28.317]  He said, you mean it's not politically correct, yet everybody uses it, said Trump.
[02:37:28.897 --> 02:37:29.357]  You know what?
[02:37:29.878 --> 02:37:31.239]  You give me a different term.
[02:37:31.559 --> 02:37:37.883]  And the guy came back and he says, the American-born childs, that's the way he put it, of undocumented immigrants.
[02:37:38.224 --> 02:37:40.325]  And Trump said, you want me to say that?
[02:37:40.725 --> 02:37:43.087]  Okay, I think I'll use the term anchor baby.
[02:37:44.008 --> 02:37:46.029]  That's the way we need to respond to this.
[02:37:46.329 --> 02:37:48.831]  You want me to use the term founders?
[02:37:48.951 --> 02:37:50.212]  I can't say founding fathers?
[02:37:50.272 --> 02:37:52.433]  No, I think I'll say founding fathers.
[02:37:52.453 --> 02:37:54.415]  You're not going to stop me from saying that.
[02:37:55.802 --> 02:38:00.065]  It's the kind of thing that I think that has some value in the campaign.
[02:38:00.085 --> 02:38:05.769]  And of course, one other thing I want to say about the political landscape here before we go to your calls.
[02:38:05.829 --> 02:38:06.789]  Oh, two things, two things.
[02:38:07.030 --> 02:38:08.571]  I've got this article here about Jeb Bush.
[02:38:09.031 --> 02:38:13.034]  You know, Jeb Bush, his big victory was that he finished in fourth place.
[02:38:13.494 --> 02:38:15.415]  So he's been telling everybody, I'm not dead.
[02:38:15.655 --> 02:38:16.296]  I'm not dead yet.
[02:38:16.716 --> 02:38:17.056]  Okay.
[02:38:17.296 --> 02:38:23.700]  Well, he may not be dead yet, but he may become dead broke if he keeps spending money like he did in New Hampshire.
[02:38:24.001 --> 02:38:28.283]  He spent $1,100 per vote.
[02:38:28.543 --> 02:38:28.924]  $1,100 per vote.
[02:38:29.264 --> 02:38:33.767]  In contrast, Donald Trump spent $37 per vote in New Hampshire.
[02:38:34.207 --> 02:38:39.170]  You know, Richard Reeves was here yesterday, our reporter who's been on site in Iowa and New Hampshire.
[02:38:39.190 --> 02:38:40.451]  He's going to South Carolina.
[02:38:40.987 --> 02:38:44.528]  He was talking about retail vs. wholesale politics.
[02:38:44.808 --> 02:38:46.509]  Retail vs. wholesale politics.
[02:38:47.749 --> 02:38:49.190]  This is a good example, okay?
[02:38:49.210 --> 02:38:59.413]  Now what he really meant by that was, wholesale politics, you're dressing people with broadcast media, or you're dressing people in massive rallies like Donald Trump did.
[02:39:00.023 --> 02:39:05.425]  Retail politics, you're going door-to-door, you're going to this diner, you're going to that business, you're shaking hands.
[02:39:05.445 --> 02:39:07.886]  That's what people do in Iowa and New Hampshire.
[02:39:07.986 --> 02:39:10.386]  But really, this is retail versus wholesale.
[02:39:10.486 --> 02:39:12.147]  I mean, Donald Trump got it for wholesale.
[02:39:12.247 --> 02:39:17.929]  He got it $37 a vote, and Jeb Bush spent over $1,000 a vote.
[02:39:18.289 --> 02:39:19.509]  Ted Cruz got it even cheaper.
[02:39:19.529 --> 02:39:20.950]  They say $18 a vote.
[02:39:20.970 --> 02:39:22.090]  This is how it kind of broke down.
[02:39:22.170 --> 02:39:22.750]  It's interesting.
[02:39:22.810 --> 02:39:23.751]  Chris Christie spent $887 per vote.
[02:39:25.151 --> 02:39:29.094]  Yeah, he basically spent all of his time, all of his money in New Hampshire.
[02:39:29.155 --> 02:39:31.376]  He couldn't get it through, so he's dropped out.
[02:39:31.977 --> 02:39:34.739]  Rubio, $513 per voter in New Hampshire.
[02:39:34.799 --> 02:39:37.462]  Kasich, $272 per voter.
[02:39:37.902 --> 02:39:40.464]  Carly Fiorina, $156 per voter.
[02:39:40.504 --> 02:39:41.165]  She dropped out.
[02:39:41.605 --> 02:39:44.168]  Carson spent just $89 per voter.
[02:39:44.228 --> 02:39:45.028]  So that's interesting.
[02:39:45.629 --> 02:39:49.612]  The other thing that I thought was interesting out of the stack of political stuff here was Marco Rubio.
[02:39:50.253 --> 02:39:54.095]  His campaign is now talking a lot about a brokered convention.
[02:39:54.695 --> 02:39:56.896]  That's really where he is putting his hope.
[02:39:56.957 --> 02:40:08.903]  He says, according to his campaign manager, Terry Sullivan, he said, yeah, this week's performance in New Hampshire was very disappointing, but we're going to extend the fight for another three weeks or three months or more.
[02:40:08.963 --> 02:40:13.005]  He said we could very easily be looking at May or at the convention.
[02:40:13.425 --> 02:40:16.627]  I wouldn't be surprised if it's May or the convention, they continue to say.
[02:40:16.687 --> 02:40:24.090]  So they're looking for a brokered convention because that's where they can really push their advantage with the establishment candidates.
[02:40:24.110 --> 02:40:28.492]  Just like I pointed out before, you know, these people in the Democrat Party, they think they love socialism.
[02:40:29.032 --> 02:40:30.773]  Well, here's an example of how socialism works.
[02:40:31.013 --> 02:40:34.315]  Straight out of Animal Farm, you know, because some socialists are more equal than others.
[02:40:34.935 --> 02:40:36.256]  Bernie Sanders, 150,000 votes, he got 15 delegates.
[02:40:39.514 --> 02:40:41.275]  Hillary Clinton got the same number of delegates.
[02:40:41.315 --> 02:40:46.779]  As a matter of fact, she started back in November with 15% of the delegates she needed for the nomination.
[02:40:46.819 --> 02:40:50.742]  She had over 440 delegates back in November.
[02:40:50.782 --> 02:40:51.583]  Bernie Sanders had 30.
[02:40:52.063 --> 02:40:55.465]  She had 62% of the superdelegates.
[02:40:55.746 --> 02:40:56.226]  He had only 1%.
[02:40:57.107 --> 02:40:58.187]  So think about that, folks.
[02:40:58.588 --> 02:41:03.091]  All these people who voted for Bernie Sanders, he didn't get any superdelegates in New Hampshire.
[02:41:03.531 --> 02:41:04.212]  He had to have 10,000
[02:41:06.093 --> 02:41:09.096]  of the unequal animals on the animal farm.
[02:41:09.116 --> 02:41:10.277]  Vote for him, okay?
[02:41:10.757 --> 02:41:15.041]  So 10,000 of his socialist voters equals one of the party apparatchik.
[02:41:15.441 --> 02:41:17.523]  How's that for crony socialism?
[02:41:18.103 --> 02:41:19.384]  You really want socialism?
[02:41:19.704 --> 02:41:23.447]  You really want everything to be decided by government votes?
[02:41:24.028 --> 02:41:26.330]  That's the way they're going to skew this.
[02:41:27.050 --> 02:41:29.573]  Let's go to Cash in Missouri.
[02:41:29.593 --> 02:41:30.814]  You want to talk about Oregon, Cash?
[02:41:30.854 --> 02:41:31.114]  Go ahead.
[02:41:32.102 --> 02:41:32.582]  Hey, David.
[02:41:32.602 --> 02:41:38.564]  You know, I've heard you talk several times about jury nullification, and that's one very powerful thing that we have.
[02:41:40.004 --> 02:41:40.264]  Yes.
[02:41:40.445 --> 02:41:49.427]  But there's also one thing I think that's even more powerful that I've been looking into and studying a little bit lately, and that's getting back to common law courts.
[02:41:51.088 --> 02:41:55.369]  Getting away from the statutory courts, which is just totally fraudulent, colored law.
[02:41:56.627 --> 02:42:03.328]  And there's an organization out there that I would really like for you or maybe somebody there within your organization to look into.
[02:42:04.029 --> 02:42:08.509]  It's the NationalLibertyAlliance.org is the website.
[02:42:09.470 --> 02:42:13.050]  They've been going for 31 months now.
[02:42:13.531 --> 02:42:20.492]  They've actually been filing core warranto and habeas corpus papers in common law court, and they're actually having victories.
[02:42:21.257 --> 02:42:28.080]  There actually have had some cases where judges, once these papers were presented to them, actually resigned the next day.
[02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:31.141]  They know how much fraud that there is there.
[02:42:31.641 --> 02:42:36.043]  They know how much, if we the people wake up enough, that they are done.
[02:42:36.363 --> 02:42:36.924]  And that's the key.
[02:42:36.944 --> 02:42:42.426]  You know, I mean, when you look at this, when a lot of this is a bluff, a lot of it are lies.
[02:42:42.466 --> 02:42:44.907]  And you go back to jury nullification and talk about that for a moment.
[02:42:45.527 --> 02:42:51.070]  When the judges come in and say, you don't have the right to look at, to judge the law.
[02:42:51.130 --> 02:43:00.894]  You may not agree with this law, but if I show you by the facts of this case that this person did X, then you need to find them guilty, no matter if you think that the penalty is excessive or whatever.
[02:43:00.934 --> 02:43:01.754]  That is not the law.
[02:43:02.195 --> 02:43:03.515]  That is not what juries are for.
[02:43:03.875 --> 02:43:13.700]  Now, as you're pointing out with these common law courts, I think if you go in and you do that, understand that a lot of times the judges are, or the, you know, the police force is going to say, we're not going to listen to that.
[02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:15.541]  Sit down, shut up.
[02:43:15.781 --> 02:43:17.142]  I'm going to lock you up right now.
[02:43:18.042 --> 02:43:19.103]  Sometimes it doesn't work.
[02:43:19.303 --> 02:43:20.503]  Oftentimes it doesn't work.
[02:43:20.944 --> 02:43:22.585]  They do the same thing with jury nullification.
[02:43:22.605 --> 02:43:26.647]  I mean, we talked to the, we had the case of the New Jersey weed man.
[02:43:26.687 --> 02:43:30.669]  This is a guy who was a marijuana activist from the West Coast.
[02:43:30.709 --> 02:43:32.630]  He went to Chris Christie's, New Jersey.
[02:43:33.431 --> 02:43:34.191]  They busted him.
[02:43:34.231 --> 02:43:36.693]  He had, he had, he's a medical marijuana patient.
[02:43:36.733 --> 02:43:38.154]  He had a huge amount of marijuana.
[02:43:38.174 --> 02:43:39.835]  He had like a pound of marijuana.
[02:43:40.735 --> 02:43:44.477]  And so they were going to come after him for very serious crimes, for distribution.
[02:43:44.557 --> 02:43:48.758]  He used jury nullification, represented himself, because a lawyer won't represent you.
[02:43:48.798 --> 02:43:50.199]  So he said, I'm going to represent myself.
[02:43:50.259 --> 02:43:58.882]  It's in the state constitution of New Jersey that the jurors have the right and the duty to judge the law as well as the facts of the case.
[02:43:58.902 --> 02:44:03.864]  He says, I know that more than half the people here agree, think that marijuana ought to be legalized.
[02:44:03.884 --> 02:44:04.344]  So he did that.
[02:44:04.384 --> 02:44:05.125]  The first judge says,
[02:44:06.470 --> 02:44:09.731]  He put up a thing that was clipped out of the New Jersey Constitution.
[02:44:09.751 --> 02:44:13.792]  The first judge told him, put that down, I'm going to throw you in jail for contempt of court.
[02:44:13.812 --> 02:44:14.372]  So he put it down.
[02:44:14.412 --> 02:44:15.453]  But he got a hung jury.
[02:44:16.053 --> 02:44:18.753]  He had seven people vote for acquittal, but they came after him again.
[02:44:18.773 --> 02:44:23.515]  The second time he got a different judge, and that judge let him leave that up.
[02:44:23.855 --> 02:44:29.036]  Let him leave up the clause in the New Jersey Constitution talking about jury nullification.
[02:44:29.096 --> 02:44:31.577]  He was acquitted 12-0 and they couldn't come after him again.
[02:44:32.017 --> 02:44:32.798]  And so that's the thing.
[02:44:32.838 --> 02:44:34.460]  I mean, you're really kind of rolling the dice.
[02:44:34.500 --> 02:44:38.043]  So there is a huge educational issue that we have to do.
[02:44:38.424 --> 02:44:41.407]  Understand that, you know, there is a lot of bluff.
[02:44:41.427 --> 02:44:43.929]  There's a lot of illegal activity that's going on by the judges.
[02:44:43.969 --> 02:44:49.314]  But the same guys who will lie to you and who will intimidate you will also lock you up.
[02:44:49.935 --> 02:44:51.296]  Without giving you due process.
[02:44:51.316 --> 02:44:55.377]  So you have to take your... you have to make that judgment.
[02:44:55.978 --> 02:44:58.699]  And it is something that is very difficult to judge.
[02:44:58.899 --> 02:45:01.560]  That's why it really is an educational issue.
[02:45:01.580 --> 02:45:02.741]  Thank you so much, Cash.
[02:45:03.041 --> 02:45:05.722]  Let's go to Kevin in California.
[02:45:05.762 --> 02:45:06.022]  Kevin.
[02:45:06.962 --> 02:45:07.923]  Can you hear me?
[02:45:08.283 --> 02:45:08.783]  Yes, I hear you.
[02:45:08.803 --> 02:45:09.043]  Go ahead.
[02:45:09.603 --> 02:45:14.265]  Yeah, the whole Cliven Bundy thing... I grew up in Vegas, about an hour north of Vegas.
[02:45:14.466 --> 02:45:15.626]  It's a little further.
[02:45:16.106 --> 02:45:16.987]  It's all about the water.
[02:45:18.280 --> 02:45:19.181]  Vegas is drying up.
[02:45:19.342 --> 02:45:24.810]  So the population has gone from maybe 200,000 to over 2 million in about 40 years.
[02:45:25.871 --> 02:45:29.817]  So I think you're overreacting about seizing this land, but it's just...
[02:45:30.245 --> 02:45:33.007]  Vegas is in desperation to find water.
[02:45:33.567 --> 02:45:35.328]  Well, it's not simply about the water.
[02:45:35.588 --> 02:45:38.830]  If you think it's about the water, then you're missing a lot of things.
[02:45:39.310 --> 02:45:42.552]  There are mineral rights that are there that they're trying to get people out of.
[02:45:42.612 --> 02:45:45.493]  And it's not just, it's not happening just in Nevada.
[02:45:45.553 --> 02:45:47.734]  If it was just happening in Nevada, yeah, I would agree with you.
[02:45:47.754 --> 02:45:48.935]  Maybe it is just the water.
[02:45:49.747 --> 02:45:50.888]  It's happening in Arizona.
[02:45:51.068 --> 02:45:53.249]  It's happening in Oregon with the miners, okay?
[02:45:53.269 --> 02:45:55.770]  It's not even just with this family, the Hammonds.
[02:45:55.810 --> 02:45:56.910]  I mean, that wasn't about water.
[02:45:57.431 --> 02:46:02.713]  They were taking the Hammonds out, taking them, shutting down their farm because they want to take over their land.
[02:46:02.933 --> 02:46:08.136]  Their land was checkerboarded with the National Park's lands and they wanted to get all of their land.
[02:46:08.436 --> 02:46:18.105]  I've seen this used against people bringing up false marijuana charges for a guy in California about 25 years ago, taking him out because they wanted his property.
[02:46:18.145 --> 02:46:25.172]  Again, it's a kind of eminent domain thing, but they thought, well, we really don't want to pay him any money, so why don't we set him up for marijuana charges.
[02:46:25.232 --> 02:46:31.799]  They put in a SWAT team, surprised him, he came down the stairway with a gun in his hand, they shot and killed him, then they took his land.
[02:46:32.279 --> 02:46:33.800]  We see this type of thing happening all the time.
[02:46:33.820 --> 02:46:37.063]  They're going to take the Hammond's land because they accuse them of being arsonists and terrorists.
[02:46:37.483 --> 02:46:39.005]  What's going on in Nevada?
[02:46:39.045 --> 02:46:40.145]  What's going on in Arizona?
[02:46:40.166 --> 02:46:41.487]  What's going on in most of these places?
[02:46:41.567 --> 02:46:42.908]  It's part of something called Agenda 21.
[02:46:43.108 --> 02:46:44.089]  You need to look at that.
[02:46:44.109 --> 02:46:45.650]  You need to understand what's going on with that.
[02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:48.793]  You need to understand they want people, everyone, off of the land.
[02:46:48.833 --> 02:46:50.654]  They want to concentrate everyone into the cities.
[02:46:50.974 --> 02:46:55.298]  There's also another aspect of this that you can see with what John McCain did in Arizona.
[02:46:56.035 --> 02:47:08.564]  What he did there was they took a park, Tonto National Park, it's something that's being used as a national park, it has, people have mineral resources there, they have grazing rights there, they have water rights there, they have a lot of different rights.
[02:47:08.924 --> 02:47:18.732]  The Indians have this, it's a sacred area to them, the Apache Indians, it is also an historical area to them, and it's a recreational area, all of those things, and yet,
[02:47:19.272 --> 02:47:25.256]  John McCain got this turned over to a British corporation who is going to mine it for copper.
[02:47:25.576 --> 02:47:32.760]  And they're going to mine it in a way that it's going to leave it in a one giant crater that is visible from space very easily.
[02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:36.562]  So you have to understand what they want to do is they want to get everyone off the land.
[02:47:37.023 --> 02:47:45.588]  Then these senators, these powerful senators like John McCain and Harry Reid, can turn this over to the Chinese or to the British or whatever.
[02:47:45.608 --> 02:47:47.009]  They can cut their deal.
[02:47:47.549 --> 02:47:50.732]  With these multinational corporations, that's really the endgame.
[02:47:50.752 --> 02:47:53.255]  It's not just as simple as saying, we need the water.
[02:47:53.535 --> 02:47:56.258]  They were playing games with a desert tortoise in Nevada.
[02:47:56.278 --> 02:47:59.221]  There used to be over 50 ranchers in that area.
[02:47:59.722 --> 02:48:02.785]  The Bundy family is the last rancher standing there.
[02:48:03.726 --> 02:48:06.729]  They said, we got to get your cattle off the land because of the desert tortoise.
[02:48:07.009 --> 02:48:10.573]  And it's Clive and Bundy and the rest of the ranchers that we talked to who had been driven off.
[02:48:10.633 --> 02:48:12.835]  They drove off the other 50 some odd ranchers.
[02:48:13.135 --> 02:48:15.698]  They all said, we used to have cattle all over the place.
[02:48:15.738 --> 02:48:17.439]  And we used to have desert tortoise all over the place.
[02:48:17.479 --> 02:48:18.701]  Now you don't see either one.
[02:48:19.502 --> 02:48:23.285]  And he had some people saying, yeah, they had a synergistic relationship there with him.
[02:48:23.925 --> 02:48:28.989]  The desert tortoise could get moisture from the feces of the cattle that were there grazing on the land.
[02:48:29.569 --> 02:48:32.972]  The BLM came in, said, yeah, they're an endangered species.
[02:48:33.032 --> 02:48:39.637]  They took 1,200 of these desert tortoise, put them under their control, and then said, hey, we don't have the budget to feed them.
[02:48:39.737 --> 02:48:43.940]  So they euthanized 1,200 of these endangered species.
[02:48:44.721 --> 02:48:46.262]  That's what we're talking about.
[02:48:46.502 --> 02:48:48.263]  We're talking about all these different issues.
[02:48:48.343 --> 02:48:49.544]  It's a very big issue.
[02:48:50.144 --> 02:48:57.548]  And underneath all of that is the issue that, under the Constitution, the federal government should not own any of this land.
[02:48:57.728 --> 02:49:03.111]  All of this land should have been turned over to the states for their management, for whatever they were going to do with it.
[02:49:03.131 --> 02:49:07.393]  It should have been turned over at the time these territories became states.
[02:49:08.894 --> 02:49:10.875]  That's what happened on the East Coast.
[02:49:10.935 --> 02:49:15.857]  But after the Civil War, we operated under a very different set of rules.
[02:49:15.897 --> 02:49:18.618]  Let's go to Damien in Arizona.
[02:49:18.678 --> 02:49:19.198]  Thank you, Kevin.
[02:49:19.639 --> 02:49:20.379]  Let's go to Damien.
[02:49:21.399 --> 02:49:22.300]  How are you doing, David?
[02:49:23.260 --> 02:49:27.942]  I love your work and I love the passion that you bring to a lot of these issues, especially like the waterboarding.
[02:49:28.322 --> 02:49:32.624]  And I really wish we only got the chance to confront Donald Trump or
[02:49:33.174 --> 02:49:40.478]  When Alex gets a chance to talk to Donald, if he does have an accent, he should really find the nuances of what he's really explaining.
[02:49:40.518 --> 02:49:46.981]  I think Donald, he himself may understand this issue, but I don't think his followers, when they hear it, they're going to understand the nuance of it.
[02:49:47.081 --> 02:49:49.102]  I think he's just using the rhetoric to get at them.
[02:49:49.282 --> 02:49:50.303]  I think that's very dangerous.
[02:49:50.643 --> 02:49:51.003]  I agree.
[02:49:51.043 --> 02:49:54.365]  I think he's responding to what, he's telling the voters what the voters want to hear.
[02:49:54.745 --> 02:50:00.948]  When you go back and you look at some of these issues, like you look at the trade issue, Donald Trump has been saying the same thing for 30 years.
[02:50:01.608 --> 02:50:11.553]  He took out a $100,000 page, a $100,000 ad page in the New York Times back in 1987, talking about how we're getting screwed with these trade deals.
[02:50:11.994 --> 02:50:15.215]  And that's what's going to happen with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[02:50:15.255 --> 02:50:17.717]  He's the best bet we've got to try to shut that down.
[02:50:17.977 --> 02:50:21.819]  He also, 25 years ago, was talking in a Playboy interview.
[02:50:21.919 --> 02:50:29.243]  He said, hey, you're not going to stop the violence of the drug war until you legalize and control it like you did with alcohol prohibition.
[02:50:29.363 --> 02:50:34.347]  No, the only other thing that I want to bring to light is that yesterday I came about, Ted Nugent had a Facebook post about how basically a lot of
[02:50:57.399 --> 02:51:04.864]  Anti-gunners and gun control people happen to be Jewish, and a lot of the response even from the gun community has been the ones from our social justice warriors, like, fire them!
[02:51:05.124 --> 02:51:05.724]  Get them off the NRA border!
[02:51:05.744 --> 02:51:06.985]  Yeah, I saw that, I saw that.
[02:51:07.005 --> 02:51:07.906]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:51:08.506 --> 02:51:09.547]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:51:09.567 --> 02:51:11.728]  Hang on with those calls, we'll take the people right on the line.
[02:51:11.748 --> 02:51:12.389]  Look at these roses!
[02:51:12.409 --> 02:51:13.149]  They're gorgeous!
[02:51:13.389 --> 02:51:14.430]  You didn't have to get me these!
[02:51:14.670 --> 02:51:17.452]  I couldn't let Valentine's Day come and go without surprising you with flowers.
[02:51:18.120 --> 02:51:24.762]  Guys, this Valentine's Day, even though she says you don't have to get her flowers, lesson number one in relationships, send her flowers!
[02:51:24.962 --> 02:51:26.362]  She'll be so happy when you do.
[02:51:26.602 --> 02:51:29.703]  The pros at ProFlowers will help you deliver at Valentine's Day.
[02:51:29.903 --> 02:51:36.285]  And right now, you can get her an incredible bouquet of two dozen assorted roses with a free glass vase for just $29.99.
[02:51:36.545 --> 02:51:39.846]  Just go to proflowers.com, click the blue microphone in the upper right corner,
[02:51:40.086 --> 02:51:40.766]  We're good to go.
[02:52:11.242 --> 02:52:14.645]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:52:15.005 --> 02:52:22.130]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:52:22.730 --> 02:52:31.096]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:52:31.376 --> 02:52:35.519]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:52:35.779 --> 02:52:40.482]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[02:52:40.802 --> 02:52:41.102]  We're good.
[02:53:10.797 --> 02:53:14.258]  I'm just a sweet old lady who needs help crossing the street.
[02:53:14.518 --> 02:53:19.679]  But the real reason I want to get to the other side is so I can steal your identity along the way.
[02:53:19.959 --> 02:53:26.401]  While you're holding onto my hand, the RFID reader in my purse is capturing all your personal information.
[02:53:26.661 --> 02:53:30.462]  Debit cards, credit cards, even your work ID badge isn't safe.
[02:53:30.922 --> 02:53:33.442]  Oh, you have an RFID chipped subway pass?
[02:53:33.662 --> 02:53:35.083]  Well now, so do I!
[02:53:36.563 --> 02:53:41.206]  Protect yourself from crimes you can't see with ID Stronghold wallets, card sleeves, and purses.
[02:53:41.426 --> 02:53:47.150]  ID Stronghold pioneered RFID blocking technology over 10 years ago to prevent electronic pickpocketing.
[02:53:47.270 --> 02:53:49.852]  Even when your wallet is open, imitators don't do that.
[02:53:50.112 --> 02:53:54.915]  ID Stronghold wallets even cost about the same as wallets in most stores, but give you extra protection.
[02:53:54.995 --> 02:53:59.157]  Visit IDStronghold.com and get the original RFID blocking wallet.
[02:53:59.358 --> 02:54:01.459]  I'm Wal Augustinowicz, founder and CEO.
[02:54:01.599 --> 02:54:04.481]  Protect yourself from crimes you can't see with ID Stronghold.
[02:54:06.981 --> 02:54:22.074]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:22.094 --> 02:54:25.137]  We're going to try to get through as many callers as we can in this next segment.
[02:54:25.157 --> 02:54:28.140]  We've got Bob, Jim, Mark in California hanging on the line.
[02:54:28.160 --> 02:54:28.840]  We'll try to get to you.
[02:54:29.080 --> 02:54:30.462]  Let's go first to Bob in Michigan.
[02:54:30.482 --> 02:54:30.662]  Bob.
[02:54:32.402 --> 02:54:34.583]  Yeah, David, you did a wonderful job.
[02:54:34.723 --> 02:54:36.324]  I just want to make one point.
[02:54:37.164 --> 02:54:40.505]  I saw the video of what I thought was a provocateur.
[02:54:40.985 --> 02:54:44.927]  He claimed to be Ammon Bundy's bodyguard.
[02:54:45.387 --> 02:54:50.669]  He was released the very next day after the convoy was stopped.
[02:54:51.049 --> 02:54:51.989]  Yeah, I know who you're talking about.
[02:54:52.009 --> 02:54:53.650]  I think Mark McConnell or something like that.
[02:54:53.690 --> 02:54:59.632]  Yeah, he held only for two hours and he gave an account that conflicted with the testimony of the people in the car.
[02:55:01.591 --> 02:55:08.036]  And I feel that that person should be brought up on charges to start exposing them, because they had no way out.
[02:55:08.116 --> 02:55:09.136]  They had the roadblock.
[02:55:09.316 --> 02:55:10.397]  They had him behind.
[02:55:11.378 --> 02:55:14.240]  He helped to institute that.
[02:55:14.600 --> 02:55:15.781]  I thought it was a travesty.
[02:55:15.961 --> 02:55:17.102]  Yeah, a true tragedy.
[02:55:17.562 --> 02:55:30.291]  And you know, when you look at what the police were doing, we had a, on Infowars.com, you'll find a video that was done by a retired police officer, and he points out that the guys that were shooting Cliven, not Cliven, but LaVoy Finicum,
[02:55:30.871 --> 02:55:34.696]  Uh, the one guy comes out behind the car that is supposedly this dangerous vehicle.
[02:55:34.736 --> 02:55:38.420]  He's standing right behind the car exposing himself to danger if that vehicle was dangerous.
[02:55:38.460 --> 02:55:44.768]  And then the other guy is coming out of the woods and he's shooting at his own people in the crossfire if he misses, uh, LaVoy Finicum.
[02:55:45.269 --> 02:55:45.889]  Absolute...
[02:55:46.630 --> 02:55:48.071]  Chaos and idiocy.
[02:55:48.111 --> 02:55:50.012]  I mean, it was Keystone Cops at the very best.
[02:55:50.032 --> 02:55:57.077]  But then, after, you know, ignoring this car, they go back undercover and then shoot it up as if they were Bonnie and Clyde.
[02:55:57.117 --> 02:55:58.999]  It's absolutely, absolutely amazing.
[02:55:59.639 --> 02:56:00.079]  Thank you, Bob.
[02:56:00.099 --> 02:56:02.561]  Let's go quickly to Jim in Connecticut.
[02:56:02.581 --> 02:56:02.761]  Jim.
[02:56:04.362 --> 02:56:04.823]  Hey, Dave.
[02:56:04.863 --> 02:56:05.383]  How you doing?
[02:56:05.683 --> 02:56:06.104]  Doing okay.
[02:56:06.464 --> 02:56:06.764]  Go ahead.
[02:56:07.525 --> 02:56:08.025]  Doing good.
[02:56:08.045 --> 02:56:15.070]  I just wanted to say what Alex talked about earlier, how we need to get involved, start working for electricians, start interviewing people.
[02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:16.962]  That's what we all really need to do.
[02:56:17.002 --> 02:56:20.767]  What I like to do is I like to call my local AM radio show.
[02:56:21.027 --> 02:56:23.991]  There's local early shows in the morning.
[02:56:24.011 --> 02:56:27.095]  They just talk about nonsense, you know, geopolitics.
[02:56:27.676 --> 02:56:32.723]  I like to get on there and, you know, talk to the audience, the host on the show.
[02:56:33.263 --> 02:56:35.104]  Yeah, that's a great way to do it.
[02:56:35.184 --> 02:56:36.125]  Call in radio shows.
[02:56:36.225 --> 02:56:36.965]  I used to do that.
[02:56:37.005 --> 02:56:41.208]  As a matter of fact, that's how Lionel got his start in talk radio down in Florida.
[02:56:41.248 --> 02:56:42.609]  He used to call in so many times.
[02:56:42.629 --> 02:56:43.470]  He was a regular caller.
[02:56:43.870 --> 02:56:48.953]  So I would listen to it and I would get so upset I would just have to call in to the local talk show.
[02:56:49.673 --> 02:56:50.854]  That's a very important thing.
[02:56:50.894 --> 02:56:58.539]  It's all about education, you know, and that's... When I look at this whole situation in Oregon, I feel like... And that was what was really dangerous.
[02:56:58.559 --> 02:57:00.020]  They were going to talk to 400 people.
[02:57:00.060 --> 02:57:01.141]  That's when they had to stop them.
[02:57:01.741 --> 02:57:05.344]  It's the education that is more dangerous than anything else.
[02:57:05.404 --> 02:57:09.908]  They don't care as long as they're staying up there, you know, in a remote refuge away from everybody.
[02:57:10.168 --> 02:57:15.412]  But they got dangerous when they're going to go talk to a meeting of 400 people about what really could be done.
[02:57:15.953 --> 02:57:16.393]  Thank you, Jim.
[02:57:16.413 --> 02:57:18.655]  Let's go to Mark in California, KOMY.
[02:57:18.675 --> 02:57:19.235]  Go ahead, Mark.
[02:57:21.277 --> 02:57:26.421]  Yeah, can I say hi to that listener on Union Ave in San Jose who I asked to
[02:57:27.509 --> 02:57:30.210]  Tune in to KOMY 1340 to follow me.
[02:57:30.650 --> 02:57:31.351]  Consider it done.
[02:57:31.611 --> 02:57:32.511]  Go ahead.
[02:57:33.351 --> 02:57:48.318]  Hey, yeah, you know, I told him there's this guy on the radio right now that's ten times better than whoever's in second place, and if all the listeners would do this... You know, I'm telling you the truth, David, and before I begin, I'm looking up near-death of foster child, near-death of foster child.
[02:57:49.098 --> 02:57:55.881]  I swear to God Almighty, on Friday's broadcast with Kathleen Willey, I told a hundred people, probably,
[02:57:56.468 --> 02:57:56.588]  Yeah.
[02:57:56.628 --> 02:57:56.868]  Yeah.
[02:58:13.092 --> 02:58:15.934]  We, as Christians, we need to start praying to God.
[02:58:16.574 --> 02:58:20.777]  I'm telling you, pray to the Lord God, like we never have before.
[02:58:21.297 --> 02:58:23.519]  Oh yeah, this country has become like Rome.
[02:58:23.659 --> 02:58:26.080]  You know, they talk about Washington as being Rome on the Potomac.
[02:58:26.120 --> 02:58:27.481]  That's quite literally true.
[02:58:27.501 --> 02:58:29.422]  They talk about Kathleen Willey.
[02:58:29.602 --> 02:58:34.586]  I don't know if you saw this or not, but Roger Stone has announced that he's going to set up a super PAC.
[02:58:34.926 --> 02:58:37.207]  They're going to call it the Rape Super PAC.
[02:58:37.708 --> 02:58:41.190]  And Kathleen Willey is going to be a spokeswoman, as well as many others.
[02:58:41.710 --> 02:58:42.931]  Stay with us for the fourth hour.
[02:58:42.951 --> 02:58:45.012]  We'll have Anthony Gucciardi and Dr. Group.
[02:58:45.032 --> 02:58:47.133]  And then tonight at 7 central, 8 p.m.
[02:58:47.193 --> 02:58:48.614]  Eastern, The Nightly News.
[02:58:52.636 --> 02:58:56.398]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:59.619 --> 02:59:00.519]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:59:00.579 --> 02:59:00.999]  Good, brother.
[02:59:01.159 --> 02:59:02.840]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:59:02.880 --> 02:59:04.641]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:59:04.821 --> 02:59:08.822]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:59:08.842 --> 02:59:11.423]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:59:11.463 --> 02:59:13.723]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:59:13.883 --> 02:59:21.806]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:59:21.946 --> 02:59:25.170]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:59:25.310 --> 02:59:26.811]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:59:26.831 --> 02:59:29.755]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:59:29.895 --> 02:59:31.256]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:59:31.537 --> 02:59:37.343]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated.
[02:59:37.543 --> 02:59:40.205]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:10.546 --> 03:00:17.329]  I could do for InfoWars.com out here in Austin, Texas, trying to find out if people know who was the real winner of the Democratic primaries last night.
[03:00:17.629 --> 03:00:24.272]  Bernie Sanders supporters are super pumped because he seemed to have a sweeping upset there for Hillary Clinton with more than 60% of the votes.
[03:00:24.612 --> 03:00:28.094]  But it turns out for Clinton, even when she loses, she wins.
[03:00:28.434 --> 03:00:31.316]  She's going to get two more delegates than Bernie Sanders.
[03:00:31.716 --> 03:00:38.539]  Either way, whatever way this plays out, Sanders, his voters are going to be really smiling now, but crying later.
[03:00:39.995 --> 03:00:40.495]  Hey there!
[03:00:40.755 --> 03:00:41.976]  Hey, what's up?
[03:00:41.996 --> 03:00:44.357]  So who do you think won the Democratic primary last night?
[03:00:44.797 --> 03:00:45.457]  Uh, Bernie Sanders.
[03:00:46.318 --> 03:00:47.298]  Bernie Sanders, absolutely.
[03:00:47.538 --> 03:00:47.798]  Right.
[03:00:47.918 --> 03:00:48.138]  Yeah.
[03:00:48.459 --> 03:00:52.380]  But Hillary Clinton, even though she loses, she wins.
[03:00:52.700 --> 03:00:53.961]  She got more delegates than him.
[03:00:57.322 --> 03:00:58.262]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[03:00:58.282 --> 03:00:59.443]  Yeah, most people don't.
[03:00:59.943 --> 03:01:01.944]  Yeah, no, I didn't know that.
[03:01:02.124 --> 03:01:02.784]  Bernie Sanders.
[03:01:03.965 --> 03:01:05.425]  With 60% of the vote, right?
[03:01:06.506 --> 03:01:06.686]  Yeah.
[03:01:07.389 --> 03:01:10.110]  Well, how did Hillary get more delegates than him?
[03:01:10.990 --> 03:01:11.370]  I don't know.
[03:01:11.390 --> 03:01:12.071]  How does that work?
[03:01:12.531 --> 03:01:12.971]  Not sure.
[03:01:12.991 --> 03:01:16.452]  Yeah, does it appear as if the system is rigged?
[03:01:16.652 --> 03:01:19.593]  Or, I mean, can the establishment ever be taken down?
[03:01:23.095 --> 03:01:23.655]  Probably not.
[03:01:24.235 --> 03:01:26.856]  This system seems like it's just flawed.
[03:01:27.489 --> 03:01:32.213]  Yeah, she went into the game with the bases loaded with six superdelegates.
[03:01:32.874 --> 03:01:40.120]  So do you think that Bernie Sanders supporters, should they continue with this fight, this revolution that's going on, or do you think that there is no chance?
[03:01:42.237 --> 03:01:44.459]  Um, there's no chance.
[03:01:45.079 --> 03:01:47.481]  She's just gonna get the delegates no matter what.
[03:02:12.778 --> 03:02:16.681]  Very socialistic, and I don't think they're exactly the best for America.
[03:02:16.721 --> 03:02:18.042]  Like I said, I don't like either one of them.
[03:02:18.062 --> 03:02:23.307]  I mean, I think the establishment would be more likely to support a candidate like Hillary Clinton.
[03:02:23.803 --> 03:02:24.003]  Right.
[03:02:24.383 --> 03:02:24.543]  Yeah.
[03:02:24.703 --> 03:02:30.504]  So does it appear as though the game might be rigged in her favor when the people clearly are wanting Sanders?
[03:02:30.584 --> 03:02:32.725]  But somehow she's ending up with more delegates?
[03:02:32.765 --> 03:02:32.945]  I do.
[03:02:32.985 --> 03:02:35.665]  I do think that's indicative of like a flaw in the establishment.
[03:02:35.685 --> 03:02:36.046]  Yeah.
[03:02:36.406 --> 03:02:44.367]  And I think too with this whole delegate system, it sort of says to these Bernie Sanders voters, you guys should just quit while you're ahead, you know, because it's not, it doesn't matter.
[03:02:45.007 --> 03:02:46.188]  She's still going to get the delegates.
[03:02:46.768 --> 03:02:47.588]  I think that's what that says.
[03:02:47.708 --> 03:02:52.569]  I've also, I mean, based on most of the Bernie supporters I've met though, they're a
[03:02:53.507 --> 03:02:58.511]  Pretty committed bunch to him and his movement and his so-called political revolution.
[03:02:58.951 --> 03:03:05.516]  So I don't think that this is going to be enough to deter Bernie supporters entirely.
[03:03:06.724 --> 03:03:07.284]  Who are you going for?
[03:03:07.405 --> 03:03:08.265]  Who do you want to see in there?
[03:03:08.405 --> 03:03:09.666]  I'm not going to vote by party line.
[03:03:09.726 --> 03:03:12.728]  I'm going to vote by who represents what I want in a president.
[03:03:13.129 --> 03:03:18.212]  And I don't agree with all of the ideals of the current candidates.
[03:03:19.373 --> 03:03:19.633]  I know.
[03:03:19.894 --> 03:03:21.675]  Rand Paul was mine, but he dropped out, so.
[03:03:21.775 --> 03:03:22.656]  Yes, Rand Paul.
[03:03:23.116 --> 03:03:24.577]  We need him to stay in the Senate, though, so.
[03:03:24.797 --> 03:03:24.997]  Yes.
[03:03:25.538 --> 03:03:26.138]  Unfortunately.
[03:03:26.158 --> 03:03:27.619]  Or go for the Supreme Court!
[03:03:27.839 --> 03:03:28.780]  Did you hear that, Trump?
[03:03:29.341 --> 03:03:33.764]  His ideas did influence a lot of the Republicans, with the support that he got in Iowa, at least.
[03:03:34.904 --> 03:03:39.227]  So do you think you'll just write in somebody random like I normally do every year?
[03:03:40.368 --> 03:03:43.891]  We'll see who's still on the ballot come Super Tuesday in the Texas primaries.
[03:03:44.731 --> 03:03:47.313]  And I'll see who I'm leading then.
[03:03:47.894 --> 03:03:50.515]  Then Hillary Clinton, even though she loses, she still wins.
[03:03:51.496 --> 03:03:53.137]  What do you think that says about the establishment?
[03:03:54.799 --> 03:03:57.380]  I'm going to decline to comment on the establishment.
[03:03:57.400 --> 03:03:57.841]  Thank you.
[03:03:58.101 --> 03:03:59.422]  So you think Bernie Sanders won?
[03:04:00.368 --> 03:04:03.089]  Um, I think he showed that he's a serious contender.
[03:04:03.509 --> 03:04:04.029]  Oh.
[03:04:04.089 --> 03:04:05.630]  It'll be, it's not November yet.
[03:04:05.690 --> 03:04:07.090]  It's a little early to be making that call.
[03:04:07.130 --> 03:04:12.292]  But I think that if he keeps playing off of this vibe, he will definitely win the nomination.
[03:04:12.952 --> 03:04:16.573]  Well, he got more than 60% of the vote last night, right?
[03:04:16.593 --> 03:04:16.673]  Yeah.
[03:04:17.393 --> 03:04:20.214]  But even when she loses, she wins.
[03:04:20.234 --> 03:04:22.114]  Because Clinton actually got more delegates.
[03:04:22.975 --> 03:04:24.075]  Do you, how does that work?
[03:04:24.855 --> 03:04:25.835]  Oh, that's easy.
[03:04:25.935 --> 03:04:27.476]  That's being in the back of someone's pocket.
[03:04:29.835 --> 03:04:42.405]  So what do you think this says about, you know, Bernie Sanders, he's coming up, this like huge revolution, it's finally time to maybe we're witnessing the fall of the establishment, and then they come in and give her some superdelegates so she beats him out.
[03:04:43.226 --> 03:04:44.487]  Politics are always nasty.
[03:04:44.527 --> 03:04:47.029]  Anything that can't be explained in numbers is usually happening under the table.
[03:04:47.049 --> 03:04:50.972]  Well there you go, definitely not any corruption, right?
[03:04:51.112 --> 03:04:54.194]  I think Bernie Sanders should work on his coin-flipping skills.
[03:04:54.214 --> 03:04:55.475]  We'll be right back with The Fourth Hour.
[03:04:55.515 --> 03:04:56.376]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:04:56.396 --> 03:04:57.297]  A lot of news to cover.
[03:05:09.787 --> 03:05:11.768]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[03:05:11.868 --> 03:05:20.914]  Now, last night, tensions were high at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge as the remaining four occupants inside of the compound called in on a live stream.
[03:05:21.015 --> 03:05:29.840]  Now, during this entire conversation, the remaining four called out what they were seeing as Humvees began to come in, MRAPs, helicopters were flying overhead.
[03:05:29.860 --> 03:05:33.543]  The FBI began to tighten their grip around those
[03:05:33.883 --> 03:05:53.129]  Four now we have a state rep Michelle Fiore and Franklin Graham on the ground they got there just about an hour ago they started talking with the FBI and they are now at this time being transported to the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in hopes of negotiating with the four inside to come to a peaceful resolution.
[03:05:53.289 --> 03:05:53.669]  Now the FBI
[03:05:53.729 --> 03:05:59.952]  The FBI has given their words that there will be no bloodshed today as long as the remaining four inside remain peaceful.
[03:06:00.092 --> 03:06:05.975]  Hopefully it doesn't turn out the way it did in John Day, Oregon when Lavoie Finnegan was shot and killed.
[03:06:06.095 --> 03:06:08.677]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.

[03:08:19.637 --> 03:08:25.896]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:28.524 --> 03:08:30.484]  It's the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:30.525 --> 03:08:31.425]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:08:31.465 --> 03:08:33.465]  I'll be your host for the rest of the hour.
[03:08:33.485 --> 03:08:41.547]  We're going to talk to Dr. Edward Group about an interesting article that has come out lately and decide whether it's real or not or valid or not.
[03:08:41.947 --> 03:08:43.368]  It caught my eye when he brought it up to me.
[03:08:44.028 --> 03:08:50.250]  Specifically from WorldNetDaily, the headline reads, huge natural disaster gets little media attention.
[03:08:50.730 --> 03:08:51.330]  Apparently,
[03:08:52.230 --> 03:09:00.775]  This natural gas leak is pumping out massive amounts of noxious fumes and even lethal, quote, lethal levels of radioactive material.
[03:09:00.795 --> 03:09:07.299]  It says, a natural disaster of unprecedented proportion is unfolding in California but has received little national attention.
[03:09:07.639 --> 03:09:15.464]  Near Los Angeles, a leaking natural gas well, which has been spewing noxious fumes for months, is now, according to some, emitting lethal levels of radioactive material.
[03:09:16.144 --> 03:09:26.828]  The methane is spewing from one of the 115 wells at the company's facility in Santa Susana Mountains, which is used to store gas for distribution to nearly 22 million customers in the L.A.
[03:09:26.848 --> 03:09:27.168]  basin.
[03:09:27.188 --> 03:09:31.449]  It has a capacity of 86 billion cubic feet and is one of the largest of more than 400 gas fields.
[03:09:33.630 --> 03:09:47.477]  And apparently, it's, according to some sources, is leaking radioactive material, and some of the sources, which I'm not sure if it's been confirmed, say that some people are experiencing some bad reactions in the area and having nosebleeds.
[03:09:47.838 --> 03:09:53.461]  So we're going to investigate that at the bottom of the hour with Dr. Edward Gruben, get his take on it, and he's done a lot of research on this.
[03:09:54.181 --> 03:10:05.755]  You know, today seems like one of those days when there's just a lot of chaotic, crazy news from Clive and Bundy getting arrested and all that stuff going on up there, to the stocks plunging, to gold going back up.
[03:10:06.536 --> 03:10:11.021]  And I remember weeks ago looking at the silver prices thinking, man, I need to get some more silver.
[03:10:11.141 --> 03:10:13.884]  You know, I have a decent supply, but I was thinking, it's just so low.
[03:10:14.505 --> 03:10:15.046]  It's just so low.
[03:10:15.066 --> 03:10:20.230]  I remember when it was $14, $15, and it went all the way up to $50, and everyone was sure it was going to keep going.
[03:10:20.250 --> 03:10:23.914]  It went back down, and we see the same thing happen over and over again.
[03:10:23.954 --> 03:10:25.515]  It climbs, it goes down, it climbs, it goes down.
[03:10:25.996 --> 03:10:35.365]  Well, as we begin to realize that we can't trust the mega-bankers with our financial stability, obviously precious metals and other assets that are actually valuable are going to go up.
[03:10:36.391 --> 03:10:41.513]  It's also in the news, beyond the share's plunge on global growth and bank fears, U.S.
[03:10:41.553 --> 03:10:50.257]  yields fall, both sides of the Atlantic, the benchmark S&P index, Dow Jones Industrial Average, dumping more than 10% for the year.
[03:10:50.277 --> 03:10:53.578]  Here's some other news with the Zika virus.
[03:10:55.399 --> 03:11:04.110]  What's interesting to me is there's been a lot of freak out about the Zika virus, and it seems that we still don't really understand what it actually does.
[03:11:04.810 --> 03:11:06.573]  Colombia, 3,177 pregnant women with Zika, yet no microcephaly.
[03:11:11.198 --> 03:11:25.327]  Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos said Saturday there's no evidence Zika has caused any cases of the birth defect known as microcephaly in his country, though it has diagnosed 3,177 pregnant women with the virus.
[03:11:25.847 --> 03:11:26.848]  He also announced that a U.S.
[03:11:26.888 --> 03:11:30.651]  medical scientific team will arrive in Colombia to help investigate the mosquito-borne virus.
[03:11:31.531 --> 03:11:38.479]  Brazilian officials say they suspect the Zika is behind a seemingly unusual number of microcephaly cases in which children are born with unusually small heads.
[03:11:38.780 --> 03:11:43.265]  The link is not confirmed, but it has helped promote the World Health Organization to declare an emergency over the virus.
[03:11:44.246 --> 03:11:47.831]  So if this is true from the New York Times, if what the president is saying is true,
[03:11:48.925 --> 03:12:01.884]  Then the Zika virus might not even cause, or maybe in a small percentage of cases, who knows, have a distinct and large link to microcephaly, the birth deformation in babies, which would change the whole game.
[03:12:02.910 --> 03:12:04.971]  Let me cover some more news, then we're going to go to a special report.
[03:12:05.771 --> 03:12:07.612]  So, we talk about the Pope, right?
[03:12:07.812 --> 03:12:12.074]  I feel like when the Pope comes anywhere, it turns into Pope Zone, and every radio show is like, The Pope!
[03:12:12.114 --> 03:12:12.414]  The Pope!
[03:12:12.434 --> 03:12:12.734]  The Pope!
[03:12:12.774 --> 03:12:13.274]  I love the Pope!
[03:12:13.314 --> 03:12:13.815]  I hate the Pope!
[03:12:13.855 --> 03:12:14.175]  The Pope!
[03:12:14.515 --> 03:12:16.436]  Just worship of the Pope over and over and over again.
[03:12:16.556 --> 03:12:18.117]  Even if you don't like him, you hear about it all day.
[03:12:18.837 --> 03:12:22.979]  But there's some surprisingly new, interesting Pope news that I just have to cover.
[03:12:22.999 --> 03:12:23.559]  Okay?
[03:12:23.859 --> 03:12:26.980]  So he's going to visit Juarez, Mexico.
[03:12:28.281 --> 03:12:30.242]  And just a few days before this happened,
[03:12:31.098 --> 03:12:35.362]  Mexican prison riot, at least 52 people killed and 12 injured in Monterrey.
[03:12:35.722 --> 03:12:49.595]  A riot at the prison in the Mexican city of Monterrey involving inmates belonging to rival drug cartels has left at least 52 dead and 12 injured just days before Pope Francis is due to visit another prison in northern Mexico.
[03:12:50.636 --> 03:12:53.218]  Think about that for a minute, right?
[03:12:53.479 --> 03:12:55.741]  52 people killed in a prison riot, but wait!
[03:12:56.809 --> 03:13:01.532]  Maybe they need, maybe the murderers need a super confessor.
[03:13:02.773 --> 03:13:05.014]  Well, what's a super confessor you might say?
[03:13:05.034 --> 03:13:17.742]  The Pope has dispatched an elite team of super confessors that are priests that forgive grave sins that normally only the Pope can forgive.
[03:13:18.772 --> 03:13:20.253]  So this is from the BBC.
[03:13:20.333 --> 03:13:24.656]  Pope Francis dispatches 1,000 super confessor priests.
[03:13:24.696 --> 03:13:28.278]  I guess this is like the Spetsnaz of priesthood.
[03:13:29.139 --> 03:13:37.484]  Pope Francis has sent more than 1,000 priests on a global mission to forgive grave sins that normally only he or a top church official may pardon.
[03:13:38.084 --> 03:13:41.507]  The Missionaries of Mercy, they even have a name, the Missionaries of Mercy,
[03:13:42.407 --> 03:13:49.390]  Nicknamed the super confessors were given the special license for the Vatican's Jubilee year, which ends in November.
[03:13:50.010 --> 03:13:56.753]  Grave sins include defiling consecrated bread and wine, violating confessional secrecy, and plotting to kill a Pope.
[03:13:57.753 --> 03:14:00.955]  Pope Francis has often said the church needs to be less rigid and judgmental.
[03:14:01.775 --> 03:14:07.777]  He declared a holy year of mercy, spread a message, and has addressed some of the 700 chosen priests.
[03:14:07.797 --> 03:14:08.958]  Well, what I would like to ask
[03:14:10.465 --> 03:14:13.388]  is how does one become a super confessor?
[03:14:14.128 --> 03:14:22.195]  How does the Pope give his ability to forgive grave sins that only he can forgive to a thousand Spetsnaz priests?
[03:14:23.376 --> 03:14:24.817]  I would like to wonder that.
[03:14:25.831 --> 03:14:34.461]  Personally, I would also like to wonder why it seems that you would think that you have to go to another human being to forgive your sins, but I don't want to get into that.
[03:14:34.481 --> 03:14:35.502]  I'm not bashing Catholics.
[03:14:35.562 --> 03:14:36.023]  I understand.
[03:14:36.043 --> 03:14:42.430]  I appreciate many of the traits, but it is a little absurd that he's sending out 1,000 Spetsnaz priests.
[03:14:42.850 --> 03:14:44.072]  Then I would also ask this, though.
[03:14:45.216 --> 03:14:48.659]  Catholic bishops not obliged to report clerical child abuse, Vatican says.
[03:14:48.979 --> 03:14:50.060]  This seems like a grave sin.
[03:14:51.041 --> 03:14:59.388]  Vatican Guide says not necessarily bishops duty to report suspects to police despite Pope Francis vows to redress Catholic Church legacy of child abuse.
[03:14:59.408 --> 03:15:02.670]  So it's not their, it doesn't, you know, they don't have to report to the police if there's child abuse.
[03:15:02.991 --> 03:15:13.960]  The Catholic Church is telling newly appointed bishops that it is not necessarily their duty to report accusations of clerical child abuse and that only victims or their family should make the decision to report abuse to police.
[03:15:15.219 --> 03:15:15.500]  What?
[03:15:16.682 --> 03:15:25.637]  A document that spells out how senior clergy members ought to deal with allegations of abuse, which was recently released by the Vatican, emphasized that they must be aware of local laws.
[03:15:25.797 --> 03:15:28.902]  Bishops' only duty was to address such allegations internally.
[03:15:29.997 --> 03:15:32.078]  Wow, so they're not even supposed to go to the police.
[03:15:32.098 --> 03:15:33.518]  You better just deal with it internally.
[03:15:33.638 --> 03:15:35.299]  Better just turn a blind eye.
[03:15:35.379 --> 03:15:36.320]  That sounds like a grave sin.
[03:15:36.340 --> 03:15:45.603]  It sounds like, to me, that some of these bishops not reporting the child abuse and rape to the authorities might need to see a super confessor.
[03:15:46.064 --> 03:15:49.405]  The Pope needs to dispatch a super confessor.
[03:15:50.705 --> 03:15:56.668]  Alright, we're going to go to a special report now by John Bowne about artificial intelligence that I think you have to see.
[03:15:58.345 --> 03:16:02.268]  American jobs are increasingly rotting from the inside out.
[03:16:02.548 --> 03:16:08.112]  MarketWatch reports there are now more than 260,000 robots working in U.S.
[03:16:08.192 --> 03:16:08.733]  factories.
[03:16:08.893 --> 03:16:12.475]  Orders and shipments for robots in North America set new records in 2015.
[03:16:13.596 --> 03:16:26.763]  According to Industry Trade Group Robotic Industries Association, a total of 31,464 robots, valued at a combined $1.8 billion, were ordered from the North American companies last year.
[03:16:27.003 --> 03:16:34.907]  The most popular jobs for these robots were industrial, including coating and dispensing, material handling, and spot welding.
[03:16:35.487 --> 03:16:51.117]  Blindsided by technological gains and a sick fascination with artificial intelligence, the leftist media spews out reports glorifying an unstoppable race towards the demise of the one thing that has kept America humming along as a global innovator for close to 240 years.
[03:16:53.018 --> 03:16:53.819]  Skilled labor.
[03:16:54.159 --> 03:16:58.064]  The numbers of apprenticing electricians, welders, machinists, etc.
[03:16:58.184 --> 03:17:00.346]  have been dwindling in the past 10 years.
[03:17:00.526 --> 03:17:03.009]  Forbes reported in 2012, 53% of skilled trade workers in the U.S.
[03:17:03.049 --> 03:17:03.970]  were 45 years and older.
[03:17:03.990 --> 03:17:05.251]  And 18.6% were between the ages of 55 and 64.
[03:17:11.618 --> 03:17:20.708]  The Tampa Tribune reports Ken Simonson, chief economist at Associated General Contractors of America, said the industry is hiring people at quite a strong clip.
[03:17:21.029 --> 03:17:26.254]  But at the same time, contractors are saying that they can't find the folks with the skills they want.
[03:17:26.475 --> 03:17:31.000]  They're having to pull in people from other industries or people that haven't done it before.
[03:17:31.380 --> 03:17:33.862]  Which isn't always something you can make do with.
[03:17:34.402 --> 03:17:42.327]  It's blatantly obvious that a combination of fundamental factors are leading to a third world future for the United States of America.
[03:17:42.647 --> 03:17:46.890]  The millennial generation is simply not interested in a vocational education.
[03:17:47.170 --> 03:17:53.094]  Projects will simply not be built in the future or may take much longer as skilled labor is sparse.
[03:17:53.494 --> 03:18:06.922]  Also, the unchecked and unethical destruction of American working families as American companies like Disney have American workers train foreign workers on temporary H-1B visas to replace them.
[03:18:07.503 --> 03:18:13.867]  The New York Times reported about 250 Disney employees were told in late October that they would be laid off.
[03:18:14.235 --> 03:18:22.839]  Many of their jobs were transferred to immigrants on temporary visas for highly skilled technical workers who were brought in by an outsourcing firm based in India.
[03:18:23.119 --> 03:18:30.163]  Over the next three months, some Disney employees were required to train their replacements to do the jobs they had lost.
[03:18:30.851 --> 03:18:39.156]  One former worker said, I just couldn't believe they could fly people in to sit at our desks and take over our jobs exactly.
[03:18:39.496 --> 03:18:45.239]  It was so humiliating to train somebody else to take over your job, I still can't grasp it.
[03:18:45.679 --> 03:18:59.327]  Of course, NAFTA, GATT, KORUS, and the impending sovereign destroying Trans-Pacific Partnership will and have destroyed millions of American jobs and led cities like Detroit, for example, to ruin in their wake.
[03:18:59.887 --> 03:19:01.328]  The robots aren't coming.
[03:19:01.908 --> 03:19:03.328]  The robots are here.
[03:19:03.528 --> 03:19:18.134]  And it won't be long before automation completely wipes out everything from cashiers to call center operators, taxi drivers, real estate agents, accountants, journalists, internet comment section trolls, etc., etc.
[03:19:18.494 --> 03:19:21.935]  It's abundantly clear the new world order global governance
[03:19:22.395 --> 03:19:34.261]  that has established itself while we were on holiday or working our third job is on the verge of wiping out the middle class and converting the remaining populace into a peasant class.
[03:19:34.461 --> 03:19:40.984]  We have all been subjected to a soft, slow war, guaranteeing our demise for decades.
[03:19:41.445 --> 03:19:43.486]  Of course, you were never told.
[03:19:43.986 --> 03:19:45.827]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[03:19:46.806 --> 03:19:48.348]  There's a report by John Bowne.
[03:19:48.989 --> 03:19:58.321]  Look, when we come back, we're going to talk a lot about a lot more news, including a British ISIS fighter who called himself Superman, but returned to the UK because Syria was too cold.
[03:19:58.602 --> 03:19:59.683]  He couldn't handle being an ISIS fighter.
[03:19:59.703 --> 03:20:00.304]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:00.344 --> 03:20:01.345]  This is the Alex Jones Show, 4th Hour.

[03:21:09.890 --> 03:21:16.853]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[03:22:09.253 --> 03:22:11.275]  Paid for by Bonner and Partners, an independent research firm.
[03:22:11.655 --> 03:22:21.122]  Fed up after years spent fighting big government in Washington, D.C., a multimillionaire businessman has spent the last 30 years tracking an obscure threat to America.
[03:22:21.342 --> 03:22:25.025]  Today, he says it's about to reach a sudden and disturbing conclusion.
[03:22:25.285 --> 03:22:28.647]  If he's right, your way of life is about to change very suddenly.
[03:22:29.007 --> 03:22:33.631]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit, to your retirement, and the family you want to protect.
[03:22:34.071 --> 03:22:35.974]  Now, he's made predictions like this before.
[03:22:36.254 --> 03:22:37.676]  And he was right then, too.
[03:22:38.097 --> 03:22:40.901]  A few years ago, he warned that housing prices would collapse.
[03:22:41.261 --> 03:22:41.702]  They did.
[03:22:42.062 --> 03:22:44.886]  Before that, he warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[03:22:45.307 --> 03:22:45.808]  They did.
[03:22:46.148 --> 03:22:48.231]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[03:22:48.491 --> 03:22:50.815]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[03:22:51.155 --> 03:22:52.536]  This will affect us all.
[03:22:52.816 --> 03:22:58.259]  A free video he's released online details everything you need to know at dollardownfall.com.
[03:22:58.559 --> 03:23:04.342]  Now maybe you'll disagree with his conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.
[03:23:04.742 --> 03:23:06.663]  Just go to dollardownfall.com.
[03:23:06.903 --> 03:23:08.744]  That's dollardownfall.com.
[03:23:08.964 --> 03:23:09.984]  Happy Valentine's Day, honey.
[03:23:10.205 --> 03:23:11.485]  Wow, look at these roses.
[03:23:11.525 --> 03:23:12.266]  They're gorgeous.
[03:23:12.506 --> 03:23:13.566]  You didn't have to get me these.
[03:23:13.786 --> 03:23:16.568]  I couldn't let Valentine's Day come and go without surprising you with flowers.
[03:23:17.233 --> 03:23:23.896]  Guys, this Valentine's Day, even though she says you don't have to get her flowers, lesson number one in relationships, send her flowers.

[03:23:35.662 --> 03:23:38.964]  Just go to proflowers.com, click the blue microphone in the upper right corner,
[03:23:39.204 --> 03:23:39.884]  We're good to go.
[03:24:16.835 --> 03:24:18.576]  It's the Alex Jones Show, the fourth hour.
[03:24:18.636 --> 03:24:19.737]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:24:20.218 --> 03:24:22.599]  And before the break, we're talking about a number of different things.
[03:24:22.619 --> 03:24:24.901]  You know, I'm reading a headline right now on the screen.
[03:24:25.362 --> 03:24:29.285]  Anti-Beyonce rally planned outside NFL headquarters over hate speech.
[03:24:29.945 --> 03:24:33.588]  And it brings me on to this topic of political correctness and hate speech.
[03:24:34.128 --> 03:24:44.956]  And before the break, I was talking about some of the ridiculousness from the high-ups in the Catholic Church not forcing or asking, even telling their bishops not to report any child abuse that they see to the police.
[03:24:45.717 --> 03:24:47.419]  You know, I'm not attacking Catholic people.
[03:24:47.799 --> 03:24:50.742]  I'm attacking those policies or those ideas.
[03:24:51.422 --> 03:24:55.025]  And it's something that most people fail to understand, unfortunately.
[03:24:55.726 --> 03:24:56.867]  That it's in the details.
[03:24:57.347 --> 03:25:05.254]  It's not aligning yourself with one thing when I say that that idea in Catholicism to not report child abuse to the police is bad.
[03:25:05.314 --> 03:25:06.536]  It's not me attacking Catholicism.
[03:25:07.438 --> 03:25:17.201]  And the whole idea of political correctness and hate speech, as you know, I believe it is a form of dominance, a form of verbal dominance, because it allows people to instantly attack you and dominate you.
[03:25:17.502 --> 03:25:19.102]  If you say something, they say, that offends me.
[03:25:19.662 --> 03:25:21.703]  That's hate speech, or that's whatever.
[03:25:22.323 --> 03:25:29.866]  That person on the other end, even if it's not, even if they're not racist, if they're not sexist or whatever, they're instantly dominated by the ideology.
[03:25:31.207 --> 03:25:40.028]  And Paul Watson has a video I want to play for you guys about Twitter policing so-called hate speech and what he thinks is really going on.
[03:25:40.349 --> 03:25:41.150]  Let's go ahead and play that video.
[03:25:41.800 --> 03:25:51.224]  Twitter has announced the creation of a new trust and safety council that critics assert will police free speech and censor conservative voices.
[03:25:51.364 --> 03:25:55.545]  And who did they pick to oversee this new advisory board?
[03:25:55.685 --> 03:25:59.287]  Everything is sexist, everything is racist, everything is homophobic.
[03:25:59.307 --> 03:26:08.310]  That's right, it's Anita Sarkeesian, the feminist who thinks that telling social justice warriors they're liars is a form of harassment.
[03:26:08.650 --> 03:26:14.613]  Harassment is threats of violence, but it's also the day-to-day grind of you're a liar, you suck.
[03:26:14.853 --> 03:26:16.674]  Let me emphasize that point.
[03:26:17.115 --> 03:26:26.900]  Twitter is now being advised on its free speech policy by somebody who thinks that criticism of feminism is a form of hate speech.
[03:26:27.140 --> 03:26:29.001]  But Twitter's a private company.
[03:26:29.381 --> 03:26:31.382]  It can censor whoever it likes.
[03:26:31.622 --> 03:26:31.982]  Right.
[03:26:32.462 --> 03:26:34.543]  And how's that working out for them?
[03:26:34.603 --> 03:26:47.146]  Since it tightened the screws on free speech and started suspending and banning conservatives, the company's stock has plunged and top executives are fleeing like rats from a sinking ship.
[03:26:47.306 --> 03:26:52.808]  Now Twitter's user count is set to decline for the first time ever.
[03:26:52.908 --> 03:26:53.588]  Hey, Twitter!
[03:26:53.908 --> 03:27:05.012]  Turning your entire platform into one giant safe space for perpetually triggered SJW cult members is not a good business move.
[03:27:05.092 --> 03:27:13.015]  Just ask Mattel, who caved to professionally offended morons by creating a fat feminist Barbie.
[03:27:13.455 --> 03:27:17.016]  A decision that resulted in a marketing nightmare.
[03:27:17.136 --> 03:27:26.143]  On the other hand, Protein World, who gave the middle finger to funless fat pride feminists, went on to make millions in profit.
[03:27:26.283 --> 03:27:30.506]  Look at what happened to Reddit and 4chan when they cracked down on free speech.
[03:27:30.866 --> 03:27:32.487]  Didn't go so well.
[03:27:32.668 --> 03:27:38.252]  Twitter claims that its new Ministry of Truth contains a diversity of voices.
[03:27:38.432 --> 03:27:41.134]  And that claim is total bullshit.
[03:27:41.274 --> 03:27:46.398]  Not a single one of the organisations listed is an unrestricted proponent
[03:27:46.718 --> 03:27:47.658]  ...of free speech.
[03:27:47.818 --> 03:27:53.780]  Groups like the Foundation for Individual Rights and the Electronic Frontier Foundation aren't involved.
[03:27:53.860 --> 03:27:56.240]  There's no diversity whatsoever.
[03:27:56.661 --> 03:28:02.562]  Most of these groups are dedicated to censorship and smearing their political adversaries.
[03:28:02.722 --> 03:28:12.785]  Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey thinks that freedom of expression starts with safety, a line that wouldn't look out of place in Orwell's 1984.
[03:28:15.922 --> 03:28:26.848]  And isn't it an amazing coincidence how Twitter began this censorship purge immediately after a member of the Saudi royal family became its second biggest shareholder.
[03:28:26.948 --> 03:28:35.793]  Saudi Arabia, the country that tortures and executes people who break blasphemy laws by criticising the religion of Islam.
[03:28:35.853 --> 03:28:39.976]  Twitter also reserves the right to ban people who criticise Islam.
[03:28:40.436 --> 03:28:45.777]  Characterizing advocacy against someone's religion as hate speech.
[03:28:45.877 --> 03:28:53.019]  But it's not just Twitter that's thrown in the towel and allowed itself to be subverted by regressive authoritarians.
[03:28:53.179 --> 03:29:00.681]  Facebook is now working with the German government and ex-Stasi members to punish critics of mass immigration.
[03:29:00.821 --> 03:29:08.063]  One Dutch man who said on social media that he thought allowing in untold numbers of migrants was a quote bad plan
[03:29:08.763 --> 03:29:12.404]  later received a home visit from the police.
[03:29:12.624 --> 03:29:20.086]  Websites like The Guardian are also closing down comment sections because their leftist narratives are being demolished.
[03:29:20.306 --> 03:29:25.288]  Hey Jack Dorsey, if you want Twitter to go down the toilet, then go ahead.
[03:29:25.808 --> 03:29:33.434]  Turn it into one giant circle jerk safe space for Islamists, feminists and social justice warriors.
[03:29:33.674 --> 03:29:39.778]  Slap a giant censored sticker over what made social media great in the first place.
[03:29:40.239 --> 03:29:49.085]  Vigorous debate, dissent and a true diversity of opinion will simply take our huge audiences elsewhere.
[03:29:49.225 --> 03:29:54.830]  The cultural renaissance will continue to rise with or without
[03:29:55.430 --> 03:29:55.991]  Twitter.
[03:29:58.858 --> 03:29:59.760]  We're on the march.
[03:30:00.281 --> 03:30:01.885]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.807 --> 03:30:05.513]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.844 --> 03:30:14.805]  Top story on Drudge Report this morning, gold surges to a one-year high on fears of financial uncertainty.
[03:30:15.005 --> 03:30:19.446]  That's right, spot gold has surged nearly 4% to $1,240 an ounce.
[03:30:19.726 --> 03:30:25.047]  It's highest since February 2015, and it's on track for its biggest daily rise since December 1st, 2014.
[03:30:25.367 --> 03:30:34.929]  The rise in gold is being triggered by financial instability fears that are fueled by European bank shares slumping to multi-year lows, with concerns mounting over banks' profitability and a low growth
[03:30:35.149 --> 03:30:36.409]  Low interest rate environment.
[03:30:36.529 --> 03:30:42.551]  Analyst Matthew Turner said, Investors are concerned that Central Bank's solution is negative interest rates or at least not rising rates.
[03:30:42.691 --> 03:30:43.851]  And that is gold friendly.
[03:30:44.091 --> 03:30:49.472]  James Butterfield added, Investors are returning to gold as a core diversifier and safe haven investment.
[03:30:49.612 --> 03:30:54.093]  Given the increasingly challenging investment and economic environment, we expect this trend to continue.
[03:30:54.333 --> 03:30:57.274]  Silver is also experiencing a surge, jumping nearly 2% to $15.60 an ounce.
[03:30:59.634 --> 03:31:00.635]  It's highest since November 2015.
[03:31:01.095 --> 03:31:06.017]  A year ago at this time, silver was hovering nearly $17.50 an ounce.
[03:31:06.398 --> 03:31:09.299]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:31:09.479 --> 03:31:13.842]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[03:31:14.122 --> 03:31:18.764]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[03:31:18.884 --> 03:31:19.885]  Talk about the effects.
[03:31:20.205 --> 03:31:21.686]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[03:31:21.706 --> 03:31:23.327]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[03:31:23.647 --> 03:31:24.707]  I feel like I look better.
[03:31:24.747 --> 03:31:25.408]  I feel better.
[03:31:25.468 --> 03:31:26.528]  I feel sexier.
[03:31:26.548 --> 03:31:27.269]  I love it.

[03:32:10.507 --> 03:32:13.910]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:32:14.270 --> 03:32:21.415]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:32:22.016 --> 03:32:30.342]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:32:30.662 --> 03:32:34.785]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:32:35.045 --> 03:32:38.828]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastic,
[03:32:38.848 --> 03:32:39.208]  We're good.

[03:33:22.802 --> 03:33:45.509]  We're back, it's the fourth hour, it's Anthony Gucciardi, and we've got Dr. Edward Group on the line from Global Healing Center, and we're going to talk about this huge natural disaster that's apparently getting very little attention in the media, and some sources say it's spewing lethal levels of radioactive material in Los Angeles, as well as natural gas, formaldehyde, noxious fumes, you name it.
[03:33:46.109 --> 03:34:02.498]  But first, I want to remind you that Infowarslife.com has a couple of specials that were extended from yesterday because so many people still wanted it, so please just give me one more day, including the 15% off when you buy Anthroplex and Supermail Vitality together in a pack.

[03:34:57.578 --> 03:34:59.002]  Hey, thanks for having me on, Anthony.
[03:34:59.042 --> 03:34:59.724]  It's always fun to...
[03:35:00.911 --> 03:35:03.972]  Share new and exciting reports with you guys.
[03:35:04.232 --> 03:35:04.872]  Absolutely, man.
[03:35:04.932 --> 03:35:05.892]  It's always fun talking with you.
[03:35:05.912 --> 03:35:07.253]  You know, we can talk for hours and hours.
[03:35:07.293 --> 03:35:09.273]  We've done live streams for five, six hours at a time.
[03:35:09.653 --> 03:35:13.815]  So, first of all, I want to ask you about this story because you emailed it to me and you know a lot more about it than me.
[03:35:14.215 --> 03:35:17.536]  So, WorldNetDaily says, huge natural disaster, gets little media attention.
[03:35:17.976 --> 03:35:20.096]  Says there's a leak near Los Angeles.
[03:35:20.116 --> 03:35:23.057]  There's a bunch of different sources, ENE News and all these different sources.
[03:35:23.097 --> 03:35:24.437]  Some of them are smaller.
[03:35:24.697 --> 03:35:26.098]  They're saying the leak was discovered.
[03:35:26.998 --> 03:35:40.857]  Officially, on December 7th, I guess it was discovered on October 23rd, but on December 7th, a video emerged showing a cloud of methane gas hovering over the upscale community of Porter Ranch, and an infrared camera showed the leak is just going crazy.
[03:35:40.877 --> 03:35:41.398]  What's going on here?
[03:35:42.560 --> 03:35:49.663]  Well, there's not a lot of information coming out, although we know that people are suffering in the area.
[03:35:49.703 --> 03:35:57.926]  They're suffering with nosebleeds, vomiting, many other symptoms, and I started looking into it because we were getting some calls, which is really devastating.
[03:35:57.946 --> 03:36:11.291]  You know, if you live... That's a heavily populated area, Los Angeles, and we know for a fact that there's massive amounts of methane and radon coming out, but there's also naturally occurring uranium
[03:36:12.231 --> 03:36:16.857]  And toxic substances that are in the ground and when you have a volcano like effect...
[03:36:17.935 --> 03:36:45.203]  like these infrared photos of this gas coming out that to me would be considered a massive potential radiation emergency of course anything that has to do with the radiation is hush-hush all the time because the government's just like Fukushima all over the world we now know that radiation is destroying the ocean the fish are coming down with cancerous tumors but this is like right over the city I mean this is with children
[03:36:46.961 --> 03:37:00.088]  And we're still trying to verify, although there was a French organization called AIPRI that came out saying that there are lethal levels of naturally occurring radiation coming out of the well.
[03:37:00.108 --> 03:37:04.610]  And they even went as far as saying that people will probably die, which is a very sad situation.
[03:37:05.270 --> 03:37:07.691]  Unfortunately, that's going to be the uranium-238
[03:37:09.592 --> 03:37:26.245]  And they're saying the levels are so serious that they're accumulating on the soil, they're accumulating on the roofs, they're accumulating, people have their windows open, so of course that gets blown into their house, so their children, their pets.
[03:37:26.585 --> 03:37:28.266]  There's been reports of pets dying.
[03:37:28.706 --> 03:37:35.612]  And I just started looking into this actually, you know, because you hear these things and you're saying this can't be going on because
[03:37:36.940 --> 03:37:41.565]  You know, why is this not being brought to the attention of all these people in the California area?
[03:37:41.605 --> 03:37:44.388]  We know how damaging and how strong radiation can be.
[03:37:44.529 --> 03:37:53.298]  So, it's still in the beginning stages and of course I wanted to let everybody, all the listeners know in the California area about this.
[03:37:53.619 --> 03:37:56.762]  There have been people that have been moving out actually
[03:37:57.443 --> 03:38:02.766]  From their homes in the California area and wanted to let people know what they can do.
[03:38:02.786 --> 03:38:10.610]  I mean, you know, if you if you're stuck in a scenario that you're breathing the air, we talk about the toxic air, the toxic water.
[03:38:11.050 --> 03:38:13.491]  This gets into the water supply for tap water.
[03:38:13.551 --> 03:38:23.877]  It's so hard to neutralize radiation and radiation is one of the things that to me is one of the most damaging to the genes, to the cells, can cause death.
[03:38:24.659 --> 03:38:31.523]  And we know that people's pets are dying around that area, and we know that people are suffering, and we know that children are suffering, too.
[03:38:31.863 --> 03:38:37.787]  Of course, most of the city officials are saying that it's just due to the high levels of methane.
[03:38:38.387 --> 03:38:40.648]  But who wants to even breathe in methane?
[03:38:40.889 --> 03:38:42.209]  Like, that's better or something.
[03:38:42.269 --> 03:38:44.611]  Oh, it's just methane and formaldehyde, guys.
[03:38:44.631 --> 03:38:45.631]  I mean, that's insane.
[03:38:46.192 --> 03:38:47.833]  It's so funny, also, because yesterday,
[03:38:48.593 --> 03:38:50.475]  Or whenever I was on the show, yeah, yesterday.
[03:38:50.815 --> 03:38:53.557]  We talked about, I said, is this the next Flint?
[03:38:53.638 --> 03:38:55.299]  And we talked about the leaking reactors.
[03:38:55.359 --> 03:38:58.322]  Two out of three nuclear sites in the United States are leaking.
[03:38:58.762 --> 03:39:04.847]  And New York has like 63,000 percent increased tritium in the water, in the groundwater supply.
[03:39:04.867 --> 03:39:06.209]  And I was saying, meanwhile,
[03:39:06.789 --> 03:39:12.652]  The media is like a spotlight and only focuses on one thing like Flint, you know, and it says, hey, Flint is such a crisis.
[03:39:12.672 --> 03:39:13.473]  There's lead in the water.
[03:39:13.533 --> 03:39:15.714]  And it is, by the way, it is significant crisis.
[03:39:15.774 --> 03:39:17.295]  It's really, really sad and really upsetting.
[03:39:17.735 --> 03:39:21.878]  But it's almost like radiation is something that the media doesn't ever touch.
[03:39:22.038 --> 03:39:25.080]  And if this story is true, this is huge news because it said.
[03:39:25.700 --> 03:39:28.322]  That it was actually discovered on October 23rd.
[03:39:28.342 --> 03:39:30.783]  So that's why there's been so much little news going on.
[03:39:31.063 --> 03:39:32.104]  But the New York thing, too.
[03:39:32.164 --> 03:39:33.025]  I mean, can you imagine?
[03:39:33.625 --> 03:39:38.008]  If these nuke plants are leaking into the groundwater supply, that is a bad sign.
[03:39:38.448 --> 03:39:41.009]  And all these plants are just kind of just like, oh, it's fine.
[03:39:41.410 --> 03:39:44.912]  They just get their licenses renewed and stuff, and no one seems to be talking about it.
[03:39:45.212 --> 03:39:48.534]  Even WorldNetDaily says this huge natural disaster gets little media attention.
[03:39:48.914 --> 03:39:51.656]  Are we, isn't it sad that we're one of the only people talking about this?
[03:39:51.696 --> 03:39:52.897]  This is disturbing to me.
[03:39:53.735 --> 03:40:05.141]  You would think that the warning bells would go off and the sirens would go off and, you know, they would be distributing things or at least trying to close the wells.
[03:40:05.241 --> 03:40:12.345]  I mean, it's getting worse and what people don't understand is, okay, let's say you have a major gas leak.
[03:40:12.405 --> 03:40:13.646]  This is a major
[03:40:14.486 --> 03:40:17.589]  Worldwide emergency right here that's going on in Los Angeles.
[03:40:17.669 --> 03:40:22.973]  They've admitted that it's leaking massive amounts of what they're saying is just methane.
[03:40:23.434 --> 03:40:25.936]  But look, you know what all the minerals are in the ground?
[03:40:25.976 --> 03:40:29.378]  This thing is a mile deep, you know, half a mile deep in the ground.
[03:40:29.438 --> 03:40:36.444]  It's going to come in, methane gas is going to come in contact with many other things on the way up from the drill holes.
[03:40:36.484 --> 03:40:39.467]  So it's not just methane gas that you have to worry about.
[03:40:40.546 --> 03:40:48.588]  I think they even said the methane gas was the equivalent of the exhaust of 337,000 cars or something like that.
[03:40:48.608 --> 03:40:49.908]  Yeah, I have it here.
[03:40:50.109 --> 03:41:04.632]  The Sacramento Bee reported the facility was releasing 44,000 kilograms of methane per hour, or the monthly equivalent of greenhouse gases released by more than 200,000 cars, according to the California Air Resources Board.
[03:41:05.012 --> 03:41:06.773]  And one of the people measurements said
[03:41:07.213 --> 03:41:10.735]  This is probably 20 times bigger than anything else we've measured.
[03:41:12.136 --> 03:41:14.577]  That is a big... This is from World Net Daily, by the way, guys.
[03:41:15.138 --> 03:41:17.959]  Headline, huge natural disaster gets little media attention.
[03:41:17.979 --> 03:41:21.682]  We should definitely continue to cover this and see what's really going on.
[03:41:22.582 --> 03:41:30.387]  And it says, ironically, the leak occurs as Governor Jerry Brown works to reduce emissions of methane and other short-lived climate pollutants by 40% or more by the year 2030.
[03:41:31.267 --> 03:41:33.789]  Isn't it funny how they always focus on these little things, like these little
[03:41:34.309 --> 03:41:38.590]  Green initiatives when there's like things spewing out toxic matter everywhere.
[03:41:38.610 --> 03:41:45.852]  They're like well we really need to work on this coal plant here and there's like just death spewing everywhere and like lead in the water and stuff.
[03:41:45.892 --> 03:41:47.152]  It's totally crazy man.
[03:41:47.472 --> 03:41:56.955]  I mean the whole environment is just polluted and they're just blaming everything and trying to get those carbon taxes and saying it's all you know due to all this.
[03:41:57.035 --> 03:42:00.236]  Now they're even saying that the Zika virus
[03:42:01.523 --> 03:42:03.723]  is caused by climate change.
[03:42:04.224 --> 03:42:05.904]  I mean, how ridiculous is that?
[03:42:05.984 --> 03:42:10.245]  And speaking of the Zika virus, this is a really interesting story from Columbia that we talked about earlier.
[03:42:10.265 --> 03:42:22.467]  The article said that there's 33,000 women infected with the Zika virus, but none of them actually are having microcephaly in the children from the no birth defects.
[03:42:22.487 --> 03:42:25.087]  So they're saying it's actually probably not related at all.
[03:42:25.407 --> 03:42:27.068]  So how much misinformation is there out there?
[03:42:27.088 --> 03:42:27.568]  I mean, geez,
[03:42:28.248 --> 03:42:30.530]  Just constantly, over and over again, we're just hearing new things.
[03:42:30.870 --> 03:42:38.817]  Not to mention, you know, today, we were talking on the phone earlier, the market, the stock market, you know, is crashing because people don't believe in the big banks anymore.
[03:42:39.638 --> 03:42:44.523]  When are people going to realize that it's not your mommy and your daddy running everything?
[03:42:44.563 --> 03:42:45.964]  You know, they're not here to help you.
[03:42:46.644 --> 03:42:50.508]  They're not here to cater to whatever you want and hold you close and keep you safe.
[03:42:50.548 --> 03:42:51.509]  The banks aren't going to help you.
[03:42:53.308 --> 03:42:55.369]  Well, I hope they realize fairly soon.
[03:42:55.430 --> 03:43:03.115]  I mean, especially here in Houston, which is the oil and gas mecca, it's really being affected with the price prices.
[03:43:03.175 --> 03:43:05.196]  But the way I see it is a change.
[03:43:05.236 --> 03:43:05.917]  You know what I mean?
[03:43:05.957 --> 03:43:09.960]  It's like we're coming in this revolution that we're part of.
[03:43:10.040 --> 03:43:12.842]  I mean, we all are part of this revolution.
[03:43:12.982 --> 03:43:18.186]  All the InfoWars listeners, what we're doing on a daily basis, bringing the truth out to the masses.
[03:43:19.918 --> 03:43:37.006]  Years from now, our kids are going to be saying, Dad, Mom, you were part of that revolution when oil and gas died and new green energy took place, when pharmaceuticals died and people started going back to the earth and using natural remedies.
[03:43:37.086 --> 03:43:38.886]  I mean, this is going to be known.
[03:43:39.687 --> 03:43:41.788]  What we're doing right now is going down in history.
[03:43:41.828 --> 03:43:44.369]  We don't realize it, but it is.
[03:43:45.029 --> 03:43:47.130]  And we are that revolution that's happening.
[03:43:47.190 --> 03:43:50.092]  I mean, years from now, this is going to be written in the history books.
[03:43:50.412 --> 03:43:54.794]  Yes, we used to actually drill into the earth and take the earth's resources.
[03:43:54.854 --> 03:43:59.056]  People are going to look back and say, why did we do that as a civilization?
[03:43:59.436 --> 03:44:01.918]  Why did we allow chemicals?
[03:44:02.698 --> 03:44:06.400]  You know, years ago, the water was polluted with all these chemicals.
[03:44:06.480 --> 03:44:09.001]  And how did people even live breathing the air?
[03:44:09.081 --> 03:44:09.662]  And why were we
[03:44:10.586 --> 03:44:15.069]  Manipulating things and genetically modifying things and what happened?
[03:44:15.129 --> 03:44:16.230]  How did that all change?
[03:44:16.250 --> 03:44:33.343]  And then they're going to say, oh, well, InfoWars, Global Healing Center, all these guys finally came together and, you know, the children are going to be, you know, saying in the history books, they're going to be looking back and they're going to be saying, reading about this revolution that we're doing right now.
[03:44:33.723 --> 03:44:39.568]  But I just want to warn people because, listen, if you live out in California and you're having fatigue
[03:44:40.168 --> 03:44:45.872]  You know, especially around the Los Angeles area, don't think that there could be something wrong with what you're doing every day.
[03:44:46.392 --> 03:45:07.225]  Headaches, nausea, you're starting to see itchy, dry skin on your children, you're starting to see your animals freak out or your animals start to get sick, scalp tenderness, any of these things, mood changes, your kids are not paying attention in school, memory problems, these are all going to be signs that you may be
[03:45:08.405 --> 03:45:37.347]  exposed to these gases and you may be exposed to low levels of radiation and you should do something about it just you know we're here to warn people and to give people solutions because they are coming to us for the truth they are coming to us for solutions and if you are in that scenario some of the things that i would recommend that you do is you know go don't drink the tap water be careful about the food that you're eating wash it
[03:45:38.027 --> 03:45:39.628]  You know, with purified water.
[03:45:39.668 --> 03:45:53.553]  Some of the natural ways that things that I do and that I recommend people, if you are exposed to these gases and low levels of radiation, potassium is really good, calcium, magnesium,
[03:45:54.710 --> 03:46:04.644]  DMSO, zeolites are really good, activated charcoal, some of the clays that are out there, the bentonite clays, the pascalite clays, those can be taken internally.
[03:46:04.664 --> 03:46:08.770]  And you know, it's crazy to think about that someone would even have to be in this circumstance.
[03:46:08.930 --> 03:46:10.572]  I'm not sure, you know, I don't think we have a conclusion.
[03:46:10.612 --> 03:46:11.093]  I don't think so.
[03:46:28.391 --> 03:46:32.274]  Think about also, you know, for example with Flint or anywhere.
[03:46:32.414 --> 03:46:34.856]  We looked at this and I broke it down for you guys before.
[03:46:35.297 --> 03:46:38.339]  There's been articles that have shown the levels in other areas.
[03:46:38.359 --> 03:46:39.099]  They're bad too.
[03:46:39.280 --> 03:46:40.360]  The lead levels are bad.
[03:46:40.601 --> 03:46:44.364]  The water supply is full of things like antibiotics and pharmaceuticals.
[03:46:44.764 --> 03:46:46.265]  I'm not saying that to belabor a point.
[03:46:46.285 --> 03:46:46.906]  I'm explaining
[03:46:47.546 --> 03:46:50.128]  That what happens is you're told, just drink the tap water, you're fine.
[03:46:50.168 --> 03:46:51.348]  Just drink the tap water, you're fine.
[03:46:51.689 --> 03:47:01.655]  And then it's the small symptoms that people don't really see, the lead in the water, it makes the children antisocial, it reduces their IQ, it reduces their ability to form sentences.
[03:47:01.695 --> 03:47:03.716]  I mean, it really messes these kids up completely.
[03:47:04.056 --> 03:47:05.357]  It makes them brain damaged.
[03:47:05.957 --> 03:47:06.938]  And it's little things, right?
[03:47:06.978 --> 03:47:11.241]  So you're not going to be sitting there in a seizure and go to the doctor, oh, you have lead poisoning.
[03:47:11.741 --> 03:47:13.806]  It's a soft little hit.
[03:47:13.826 --> 03:47:15.190]  It's a soft attack on your body.
[03:47:15.250 --> 03:47:16.393]  It really, really is devastating.
[03:47:16.713 --> 03:47:17.475]  And it's just like this.
[03:47:17.535 --> 03:47:19.340]  Maybe you're inhaling methane.
[03:47:19.601 --> 03:47:20.763]  Maybe it's really damaging people.
[03:47:21.638 --> 03:47:30.924]  But it's so sad because the problem with our system and the establishment system is that they never correlate these things because it's such a soft attack, right?
[03:47:30.944 --> 03:47:40.790]  It's like maybe it reduces your life by a couple years if you do something, if you drink the tap water, or maybe, you know, it reduces your IQ by a little bit if you drink the tap water with the lead in it and stuff in places like Flint.
[03:47:41.130 --> 03:47:43.552]  But it's never going to be something huge and monumental that you can
[03:47:43.792 --> 03:47:48.196]  So this is definitely it, and that's why it's so powerful and so scary and so disturbing.
[03:47:48.616 --> 03:48:02.787]  But as to your vision of the future, which again I think was very beautiful, I think if we look at the age we are in right now, for years, I'd say from whoever knows how long, to about just a little bit ago, we were in the age of needing information.
[03:48:02.847 --> 03:48:07.031]  What I mean by that is you talk to the average person on the street, they didn't know anything you're talking about.
[03:48:07.591 --> 03:48:09.012]  They're like, what are you talking about?
[03:48:09.352 --> 03:48:12.175]  They're modifying the food, they're stuffing the tap water.
[03:48:12.195 --> 03:48:15.918]  They didn't know anything about the political system, the Federal Reserve, what's that?
[03:48:16.198 --> 03:48:17.779]  The big banks, what are you talking about?
[03:48:18.180 --> 03:48:26.066]  And then we had the kind of mainstream hijacking version of that with we are the 99% and a lot of the food group movements and stuff like that.
[03:48:26.427 --> 03:48:28.849]  But ultimately, we culminated somewhere in the middle.
[03:48:29.409 --> 03:48:32.270]  Where I get a lot of people still don't quote-unquote know what's going on.
[03:48:32.310 --> 03:48:33.790]  They're somewhat low consciousness.
[03:48:33.830 --> 03:48:37.591]  But the consciousness of this country and the world has greatly expanded, I believe.
[03:48:37.931 --> 03:48:44.433]  And now we're in the age of solutions, action, and just really getting stuff done, right?
[03:48:44.653 --> 03:48:50.614]  So now that people start to understand things, we can actually make leaps and bounds in our society and change the planet and change the world.
[03:48:50.974 --> 03:48:52.935]  Because the fruit of our labor is paying off.
[03:48:53.715 --> 03:48:55.817]  And even if we weren't hitting it right every single time, right?
[03:48:56.097 --> 03:49:06.103]  Even if we're kind of mixing in and out, and we're hitting stuff right sometimes, and sometimes not getting it totally right, the answer is that we're trying, we have pure intentions, we have a good heart, we're doing the right thing.
[03:49:06.604 --> 03:49:09.085]  And ultimately, we are leading the charge, like you're saying.
[03:49:09.406 --> 03:49:13.508]  I mean, just over the past few years, I can see so many people getting ready for action.
[03:49:13.969 --> 03:49:16.430]  Look at the mega banks, no one even believes in them anymore.
[03:49:16.470 --> 03:49:17.371]  Look at the stocks plunging.
[03:49:17.631 --> 03:49:21.594]  It's not just because of their rigging system, it's because people are not buying the BS anymore.
[03:49:23.840 --> 03:49:34.549]  No, I agree, and we're moving to a great change that's happening, and there's a big war going on between the negative and the positive.
[03:49:34.989 --> 03:49:39.733]  I mean, I was called a granola the other day, and I didn't even know what that was.
[03:49:39.813 --> 03:49:41.435]  I had to go look it up online.
[03:49:41.455 --> 03:49:43.957]  They said, we don't want anything to do with these granolas.
[03:49:44.497 --> 03:49:46.019]  And I said, what is that all about?
[03:49:46.059 --> 03:49:50.923]  So I looked it up, and I said, a granola is someone who cares about the environment,
[03:49:51.989 --> 03:50:05.179]  A tree-hugging type that eats organic and nutritious food, is worried about the health of their children, I mean, is environmentally friendly, recycles, and I was like, well, that's, that's good!
[03:50:05.499 --> 03:50:06.300]  I'm glad I'm a grown-up.
[03:50:06.320 --> 03:50:16.728]  It's just like I used to, you know, people back in, uh, years ago when you go to Whole Foods, back when people didn't really understand what they needed to do with their diet and their life, it was like, only, only hippies go to Whole Foods.
[03:50:17.288 --> 03:50:17.508]  Right?
[03:50:17.548 --> 03:50:19.631]  Now everyone like goes to Starbucks and Whole Foods.
[03:50:19.651 --> 03:50:20.752]  Like, I'm gonna go hang at Whole Foods.
[03:50:20.772 --> 03:50:21.673]  It's like the cool place to go.
[03:50:21.693 --> 03:50:23.915]  But it was like, you're a hippie if you eat organic.
[03:50:23.935 --> 03:50:24.656]  That's weird.
[03:50:24.696 --> 03:50:24.956]  Remember?
[03:50:24.996 --> 03:50:26.457]  Now it's like all the rage.
[03:50:26.818 --> 03:50:27.679]  Everyone loves it.
[03:50:27.939 --> 03:50:31.302]  But you remember being back at the beginning when people were like, what?
[03:50:31.362 --> 03:50:31.863]  You do this?
[03:50:31.903 --> 03:50:32.303]  You do that?
[03:50:32.323 --> 03:50:33.084]  You care about your health?
[03:50:33.124 --> 03:50:33.785]  What's wrong with you?
[03:50:33.985 --> 03:50:34.525]  It's absurd.
[03:50:35.266 --> 03:50:36.547]  You're a granola, Dr. Group.
[03:50:36.587 --> 03:50:37.747]  How dare you care about the environment?
[03:50:37.927 --> 03:50:38.067]  What?
[03:50:38.448 --> 03:50:43.850]  You don't want 200,000 cars worth of methane gas to be dumped all over Los Angeles and killing everybody?
[03:50:44.230 --> 03:50:45.151]  What is wrong with you?
[03:50:45.651 --> 03:50:48.032]  Hey, we're about to go to break, but we're coming back.
[03:50:48.072 --> 03:50:51.174]  We'll cover some more points, and we've got another segment with Dr. Edward Group.

[03:54:12.937 --> 03:54:15.743]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:54:21.818 --> 03:54:23.539]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:23.599 --> 03:54:24.580]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:54:24.600 --> 03:54:30.584]  We've got Dr. Edward Group of Global Healing Center dot com on air with us right now.
[03:54:30.664 --> 03:54:34.206]  And he brought to my attention this article we're about to cover here in one minute.
[03:54:34.706 --> 03:54:36.287]  This is unbelievable.
[03:54:36.788 --> 03:54:40.050]  Concerns raised over number of children not engaging with nature.
[03:54:40.090 --> 03:54:41.611]  Now here's the part, here's the crazy part.
[03:54:42.091 --> 03:54:55.744]  More than one in nine children in England have not set foot in a park, forest, beach, or any other natural environment for at least 12 months, according to a two-year study funded by the government.
[03:54:55.764 --> 03:54:57.526]  Now let's be clear again.
[03:54:58.427 --> 03:55:04.333]  Have not set foot in a park, forest, beach, or any other natural environment, no natural environment, for a year.
[03:55:05.726 --> 03:55:06.667]  One in nine children.
[03:55:07.368 --> 03:55:17.622]  And it goes on to say children from low-income families and black, Asian, and minority ethnic households are markedly less likely than white children and those from higher income households to frequently visit urban or rural wild places.
[03:55:18.143 --> 03:55:18.964]  Just 50%.
[03:55:19.304 --> 03:55:19.985]  And by the way, okay.
[03:55:21.072 --> 03:55:22.993]  Talk about real racism for a second.
[03:55:23.734 --> 03:55:25.435]  Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic.
[03:55:25.535 --> 03:55:26.175]  They have a name.
[03:55:26.255 --> 03:55:28.637]  B-A-M-E.
[03:55:28.697 --> 03:55:35.621]  I don't know how Asian, Black, and presumably Hispanic ethnicities are all lumped into one category in the study because that makes no sense.
[03:55:36.061 --> 03:55:41.405]  But anyway, so one in nine children in England have not set foot in any natural environment for a year.
[03:55:41.465 --> 03:55:43.906]  This is totally absurd, totally insane.
[03:55:44.226 --> 03:55:45.927]  A Guardian article Dr. Group wants to talk about.
[03:55:45.947 --> 03:55:48.329]  We're going to talk to him in a second about that, get his take on it.
[03:55:48.649 --> 03:55:49.830]  But first, producer
[03:55:50.771 --> 03:55:52.753]  In the back there, Daria was telling me something.
[03:55:52.773 --> 03:55:54.155]  What were you saying about the word doctor?
[03:55:54.175 --> 03:56:02.225]  Hey, yeah, so I just realized during the break that the Russian word for doctor comes from a Russian word that means liar.
[03:56:03.046 --> 03:56:03.907]  It's very interesting.
[03:56:03.967 --> 03:56:05.389]  Now, now let me give you my take on this.
[03:56:05.769 --> 03:56:07.432]  Okay, you're gonna think I'm gonna trash doctors.
[03:56:07.892 --> 03:56:08.473]  I actually have
[03:56:09.973 --> 03:56:13.096]  One of my closest friends is a dentist, a doctor of dental surgery.
[03:56:13.136 --> 03:56:14.338]  Another is a medical doctor.
[03:56:14.358 --> 03:56:21.264]  And I have two other good friends that are medical doctors that own emergency clinics and run major hospitals in Dallas and other areas.
[03:56:21.905 --> 03:56:23.366]  Again, these are people I'm close friends with.
[03:56:24.007 --> 03:56:24.928]  And obviously, Dr. Group.
[03:56:25.248 --> 03:56:25.569]  So look.
[03:56:26.249 --> 03:56:37.116]  I think that most doctors are starting to get it and move away from pharmaceutical drugs like prednisone, which are some of the worst things ever, and realize that natural medicine has a role.
[03:56:37.336 --> 03:56:42.700]  And I'll also say, if you're in a car accident, you better pray to God that you have a medical doctor nearby or some type of surgeon.
[03:56:42.920 --> 03:56:43.740]  So they have a role.
[03:56:44.121 --> 03:56:50.905]  But the problem is when they buy into the establishment lie that everything is cut, burned, and drug up.
[03:56:51.185 --> 03:56:52.066]  Wouldn't you agree, Dr. Group?
[03:56:52.086 --> 03:56:53.186]  I mean, not all doctors are bad.
[03:56:53.226 --> 03:56:55.588]  A lot of them are really realizing what's going on.
[03:56:56.232 --> 03:56:57.693]  No, I totally agree.
[03:56:57.733 --> 03:57:17.762]  Even like 15 years ago, I was called a quack practically every single day, and in the last five years, it's amazing how many medical doctors have contacted us and read the book and really want to learn about natural medicine, whether or not to just switch completely over, especially with Obamacare.
[03:57:18.222 --> 03:57:19.483]  It is a disaster.
[03:57:19.823 --> 03:57:21.104]  Doctors aren't getting paid.
[03:57:21.664 --> 03:57:26.729]  The individual demand from the patients that are coming into the doctor's offices.
[03:57:27.089 --> 03:57:31.933]  Doctors, the average time spent with a patient is less than seven minutes.
[03:57:32.434 --> 03:57:37.198]  That statistic is changing because patients are asking doctors more information.
[03:57:37.739 --> 03:57:41.902]  So now the amount of time that the patients are requesting from the doctor
[03:57:42.543 --> 03:57:57.126]  has gone up and the doctors are being forced to learn about natural medicine because the patients are bringing in supplements saying can i take these with your pharmaceuticals and so uh... the good news is that they are i mean you you're starting to see that even though the a m a
[03:57:57.867 --> 03:58:01.989]  And the insurance carriers are fighting heavily against that.
[03:58:02.049 --> 03:58:03.930]  Well, yeah, because they're pushing the establishment part.
[03:58:03.950 --> 03:58:08.993]  You know, wouldn't it be insane if the listeners and everyone, all your haters and everything, knew how many people you've treated?
[03:58:09.013 --> 03:58:10.273]  Remember, I was at your office last time.
[03:58:10.313 --> 03:58:18.838]  We were talking with our buddy, who's also a doctor, Therese, in your office, saying how he does cardiac surgeons and all these major hospital ward people and stuff.
[03:58:18.858 --> 03:58:19.898]  It's, like, totally insane.
[03:58:19.938 --> 03:58:25.541]  If people knew that all their MDs are going to you, they might have a change of heart for the haters.
[03:58:25.581 --> 03:58:26.742]  But I think most people are getting it.
[03:58:27.342 --> 03:58:29.584]  We're about to go to the end of the show, Dr. Group.
[03:58:29.624 --> 03:58:30.825]  Any final words, real quick?
[03:58:31.505 --> 03:58:34.107]  Well, any final words relate back to that article.
[03:58:34.168 --> 03:58:36.429]  I mean, we now, it's just sickening.
[03:58:36.690 --> 03:58:38.191]  And it's part of Agenda 21.
[03:58:38.251 --> 03:58:42.354]  They want to pull all the children, all the families into big city environments.
[03:58:42.914 --> 03:58:46.217]  Get outside, get in nature, breathe clean air, drink clean water.
[03:58:46.237 --> 03:58:47.498]  All right, we'll be right back, Dr. Group.
[03:58:47.538 --> 03:58:47.978]  Thanks so much.
[03:58:47.998 --> 03:58:48.679]  This is the end of the show.
