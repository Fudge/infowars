[00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:20.405]  Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:20.465 --> 00:00:22.626]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.786 --> 00:00:23.667]  I'm Darren McBreen.
[00:00:23.707 --> 00:00:29.569]  It is Friday, February 19th, 2016, and here's a quick look at what's coming up.
[00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.653]  Tonight, the crew has returned from their investigation into the death of Justice Scalia.
[00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:43.414]  Find out what they uncovered next.
[00:00:44.537 --> 00:00:51.010]  You've got a judge who over the phone pronounces the Supreme Court justice dead.
[00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.092]  We don't need to see anything.
[00:00:52.153 --> 00:00:52.794]  It's all done.
[00:00:53.054 --> 00:00:54.678]  This was a Republican president.
[00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.661]  A ranch owned by a Republican donor, and it was a liberal judge who died out there.
[00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:02.823]  The entire left would be screaming and crying, asking for an investigation.
[00:01:03.303 --> 00:01:07.125]  As soon as this man's name came down over the wire, this place should have been locked down.
[00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:08.906]  They should have called for an investigation.
[00:01:09.126 --> 00:01:12.027]  They should have done an autopsy, toxicology, and all of that.
[00:01:12.347 --> 00:01:14.709]  Instead, they take the body and drive it to El Paso.
[00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:19.531]  Now, we have an investigator in El Paso right now who just spoke to the mortician who did the embalming.
[00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:22.913]  They just drained his fluids and threw them into the El Paso sewage.
[00:01:23.814 --> 00:01:26.622]  Oh my god, you're kidding me, they did that already?
[00:01:26.642 --> 00:01:28.948]  Yes, that has already been done.
[00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:01.624]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:03.206]  You can't survive without it.
[00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:04.308]  But where do you get it?

[00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:37.442]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:37.722 --> 00:02:38.503]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:38.743 --> 00:02:39.363]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:39.663 --> 00:02:41.484]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:20.894]  Veteran homicide investigators all across the country have some very serious questions about the way local and federal authorities in Texas handled, or better said mishandled, the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
[00:03:21.395 --> 00:03:29.199]  With confirmation that he was found dead last Saturday morning with a pillow over his head and his clothes unwrinkled,
[00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:46.191]  Retired police detectives nationwide began to look into the case and then publicly expressed their concerns that the official investigation and handling of the case has thus far been a complete disaster and highly unusual.
[00:03:46.572 --> 00:03:58.801]  In fact, it was former head of criminal investigations for the DC police, William Ritchie, who told the Washington Post, my gut tells me that there is something fishy going on
[00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:04.923]  Well, you could say that again, and how's this for a botched investigation?
[00:04:05.243 --> 00:04:16.566]  You have a Supreme Court Justice who died mysteriously on his bed in a far-off remote location, the Cibolo Ranch and Resort in Marfa, Texas.
[00:04:16.946 --> 00:04:21.287]  The owner of the ranch is Texas millionaire John Poindexter.
[00:04:21.747 --> 00:04:25.529]  Shown here shaking hands with President Barack Obama.
[00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:35.574]  And that's because Poindexter is also a huge financial donor to the Democrats and a big time Obama supporter.
[00:04:36.074 --> 00:04:42.337]  He also happened to be the first guy to discover the body there at the scene of Scalia's death.
[00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:45.719]  It was Poindexter who then called the local authorities.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:55.127]  He told them that Scalia had died and they officially declared that he was dead over the phone without an official medical examination.
[00:04:55.647 --> 00:05:00.091]  No autopsy was ordered for the Supreme Court justice.
[00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:07.056]  Presidio Judge Cinderella Guevara pronounced that Scalia had died of natural causes.
[00:05:07.496 --> 00:05:11.419]  The death certificate will say that he suffered a heart attack.
[00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:17.343]  Remember, there was no medical examination, but they're going to tell us that it was a heart attack.
[00:05:17.644 --> 00:05:22.107]  And there was also nobody there to examine the body who was trained in homicides.
[00:05:22.367 --> 00:05:26.111]  So nobody there to look around and see if there was any foul play involved.
[00:05:26.512 --> 00:05:27.353]  Very strange.
[00:05:27.513 --> 00:05:30.876]  I guess we're supposed to just take their word for it.
[00:05:31.277 --> 00:05:41.808]  Poindexter said that there's no doubt in his mind that there was no struggle and that Scalia died peacefully in his sleep.
[00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:43.149]  And you know what?
[00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.230]  Maybe he's right.
[00:05:44.731 --> 00:05:47.973]  Maybe Scalia did die of a heart attack in his sleep.
[00:05:48.033 --> 00:05:51.756]  I mean, the guy was 79 years old, so it could have happened, right?
[00:05:52.616 --> 00:06:03.204]  But any reasonable law enforcement agency, they would have immediately set up a crime scene, and then they would have launched an investigation into his death.
[00:06:03.824 --> 00:06:09.889]  In fact, they broke Texas law by not following standard operating procedures.
[00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:23.592]  I believe that in this day and time, with someone as important as a sitting justice on the Supreme Court, that you would have such a haphazard death investigation.
[00:06:24.373 --> 00:06:32.695]  And that was former head of the Homicide Division in Washington D.C., William Ritchie, with a big WTF thought bubble over his head.
[00:06:33.732 --> 00:06:42.127]  Look, Scalia held one of the most important positions in the world and there's no doubt that he has some very powerful enemies.
[00:06:42.548 --> 00:06:46.435]  There needs to be an investigation and they should have done an autopsy.
[00:06:47.296 --> 00:06:52.461]  Upon hearing Scalia's death due to natural causes, most people brushed it off.
[00:06:52.721 --> 00:06:54.242]  He was 79 years old.
[00:06:54.582 --> 00:06:57.105]  But then the fumbling of the details began.
[00:06:57.365 --> 00:07:05.952]  Presidio County Judge Cinderella Guevara pronounced Scalia dead due to natural causes without seeing the body or even ordering an autopsy.
[00:07:06.253 --> 00:07:11.057]  If you believe that, you ought to go back to monarchy that the people are such sheep.
[00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:17.105]  That they just swallow whatever they see on television or read in the newspapers?
[00:07:17.385 --> 00:07:33.276]  And the highly decorated Vietnam veteran and prized Democratic Party donor and Cibolo Creek Ranch owner, John Poindexter, continually changed his story until he finally blurted out that Scalia was found with a pillow over his head and the sheets were unwrinkled.
[00:07:33.556 --> 00:07:40.382]  The Washington Post reports, quote, William O. Ritchie, a former commander and former head of criminal investigations for D.C.
[00:07:40.442 --> 00:07:45.486]  police, wrote, You have a Supreme Court justice who died, not in attendance of a physician.
[00:07:45.786 --> 00:07:48.008]  You have a non-homicide-trained U.S.
[00:07:48.068 --> 00:07:52.151]  marshal tell the justice of the peace that no foul play was observed.
[00:07:52.371 --> 00:08:02.780]  You have a justice of the peace pronounce death while not being on the scene and without any medical training opining that the justice died of a heart attack.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.381]  What medical proof exists of a myocardial infarction?
[00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:08.721]  Why not a cerebral hemorrhage?
[00:08:09.401 --> 00:08:09.961]  End quote.
[00:08:10.261 --> 00:08:18.683]  Any signs of strangulation uncovered by a mandatory standard autopsy, such as patechial hemorrhage, would have sounded off alarm bells.
[00:08:18.903 --> 00:08:24.204]  Yet an autopsy of one of the most powerful people in the United States was neglected.
[00:08:24.544 --> 00:08:32.225]  Meanwhile, towns like Fowl Furious, Texas shell out money they don't have to perform autopsies on illegal aliens.
[00:08:32.865 --> 00:08:52.686]  The meager funds that Brooks County accumulates from their property taxes and funds given to them by the state of Texas and not the federal government go here to bury undocumented migrants crossing illegally across the border just 60 miles south a day's walk
[00:08:53.544 --> 00:08:55.306]  To their deaths of dehydration.
[00:08:55.627 --> 00:08:57.869]  The effective tax rate cannot exceed 80 cents.
[00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.955]  And the effective tax rate at that time would have been 97 cents.
[00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:04.838]  So we had to reduce our budget by 17 cents.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.882]  Because it cannot go over that, and that's by law.
[00:09:08.763 --> 00:09:27.064]  Compounded by the amount that we spend, and that figure is dealing with autopsies, it's dealing with the wear and tear of the vehicles, the sheriff's department, the JP's, the magistrates, the death certificates, all the paperwork that's entailed, getting out to these areas that are very, very remote.
[00:09:27.945 --> 00:09:34.608]  I personally have been taken to pronounce a body when the sheriff officer with me says, oh, there went the transmission.
[00:09:34.928 --> 00:09:46.252]  Currently, it may not appear that Scalia's suspicious end at a West Texas resort amounts to much to the average citizen, 32% of which have never even heard of him, according to a Gallup poll.
[00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:56.316]  But in the months to come, if all goes well for Obama by way of a corporacratic faux-Republican majority in Congress and Obama's go-it-alone approach to the executive office,
[00:09:56.596 --> 00:10:11.501]  Scalia's death will be regarded as the final nail to be driven into the Federal Republic of the United States as Obama transforms the United States into a unitary republic, legally ruled by an all-powerful central government.
[00:10:12.057 --> 00:10:15.799]  It's always suspicious when a judge, at any level, gets killed.
[00:10:16.179 --> 00:10:23.083]  Because judges sit in a position where they make decisions that can destroy people's lives.
[00:10:23.163 --> 00:10:25.544]  And so they make a lot of enemies in the course of their work.
[00:10:25.925 --> 00:10:32.888]  But when you've got a Supreme Court Justice, this Supreme Court Justice is deciding the life and death of entire industries.
[00:10:33.148 --> 00:10:36.270]  He's deciding the life and death of global agendas.
[00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:36.951]  Exactly.
[00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:40.773]  And as a matter of fact, he just had a decision like that a few days before he died.
[00:10:41.493 --> 00:10:43.077]  Shutting down all the carbon plants.
[00:10:43.478 --> 00:10:45.543]  No, we're going to defend the Second Amendment.
[00:10:45.643 --> 00:10:46.766]  No, we're going to control the border.
[00:10:47.087 --> 00:10:48.811]  No, we're not going to let the TPP run everything.
[00:10:48.851 --> 00:10:49.472]  And they went, oh really?
[00:10:49.493 --> 00:10:49.793]  You're dead!
[00:10:50.771 --> 00:10:51.871]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:10:52.232 --> 00:10:53.592]  That is what is very suspicious.
[00:10:53.892 --> 00:11:08.057]  Because you've got him being involved in something that is not only shutting the coal industry down, but that decision that they made to put a stay on Obama's EPA orders to take down the coal industry also had massive impacts on their whole climate change agenda.
[00:11:08.137 --> 00:11:12.198]  So that decision wasn't just of national importance, it was of international importance.
[00:11:12.218 --> 00:11:19.501]  And the globalists, according to the Financial Times of London, have spent more than $60 billion the last 20 years pushing the global warming carbon tax bull.
[00:11:20.001 --> 00:11:21.422]  And he just shot it down.
[00:11:21.762 --> 00:11:23.843]  And so maybe it's just a message to the rest of the court.
[00:11:24.164 --> 00:11:26.885]  You do what you're told or you're going to end up with a pillow over your head.
[00:11:27.526 --> 00:11:27.966]  That's right.
[00:11:27.986 --> 00:11:30.687]  Scalia had some very powerful enemies.
[00:11:30.928 --> 00:11:41.494]  And if this was indeed a hit job, well, it certainly would send a powerful message to anyone standing in the way of the globalist agenda.
[00:11:41.814 --> 00:11:46.277]  Perhaps Scalia felt as if he was one of the untouchables.
[00:11:47.477 --> 00:11:48.258]  What can he do to me?
[00:11:50.906 --> 00:11:51.707]  Or to any of us.
[00:11:51.727 --> 00:11:52.687]  We have life tenure.
[00:11:53.068 --> 00:11:57.591]  And we have it precisely so that we will not be influenced by politics.
[00:11:58.231 --> 00:11:59.813]  By threats from anybody.
[00:12:02.234 --> 00:12:02.875]  What the hell is this?
[00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:04.496]  It's a Sicilian message.
[00:12:05.196 --> 00:12:07.098]  It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.
[00:12:07.864 --> 00:12:13.510]  And it gets even more suspicious when the people out there in Presidio County won't talk to anybody.
[00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:17.935]  When the people in charge of the case refuse to answer questions.
[00:12:18.375 --> 00:12:20.297]  When they don't participate in interviews.
[00:12:20.577 --> 00:12:22.640]  And when they turn their backs on our cameras.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.963]  Tell you what, something strange is going on out there.
[00:12:26.243 --> 00:12:28.446]  To me, this looks like a cover-up.
[00:12:30.186 --> 00:12:31.787]  I wanted to speak to Jennifer Miller.
[00:12:33.067 --> 00:12:33.968]  My name is David Knight.
[00:12:34.428 --> 00:12:34.808]  Hi.
[00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:37.309]  Anthony Garton.
[00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:39.410]  I just had a quick question.
[00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:40.551]  Are you with the Sheriff's Office?
[00:12:40.731 --> 00:12:42.512]  No, I'm with the City County Council.
[00:12:42.552 --> 00:12:42.712]  Okay.
[00:12:42.772 --> 00:12:43.712]  Hi, Jennifer.
[00:12:44.172 --> 00:12:44.572]  Hello.
[00:12:44.612 --> 00:12:45.493]  I had a quick question.
[00:12:45.513 --> 00:12:46.773]  We're with the press.
[00:12:46.793 --> 00:12:47.654]  My name is David Knight.
[00:12:48.494 --> 00:12:51.056]  I had a couple of questions going back and forth between the Sheriff.
[00:12:51.156 --> 00:13:07.868]  I wasn't really clear how the federal marshals were involved, because the press reports that I've seen are conversations back and forth between you and the Sheriff, but I was trying to tie down a timeline as to who was involved at what point, who made the decisions on the autopsy.
[00:13:07.988 --> 00:13:10.870]  Was that something the federal marshals were involved with?
[00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.312]  I've given a statement to the Big Red Sentinel.
[00:13:13.592 --> 00:13:14.493]  You'll have to go to them.
[00:13:14.973 --> 00:13:16.134]  They have my official statements.
[00:13:16.614 --> 00:13:17.695]  So they're your spokesman?
[00:13:18.991 --> 00:13:22.774]  Because this is a story of national importance.
[00:13:22.954 --> 00:13:23.675]  I understand.
[00:13:23.715 --> 00:13:25.336]  This is a story of national importance.
[00:13:25.457 --> 00:13:29.420]  There's a lot of people who are very concerned that procedures were not followed.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.883]  And they want to know who was making that decision.
[00:13:32.903 --> 00:13:34.764]  Was that something the sheriff was doing?
[00:13:34.784 --> 00:13:36.606]  Or was that something the federal marshals were doing?
[00:13:36.786 --> 00:13:37.707]  Is it something you were doing?
[00:13:38.247 --> 00:13:39.348]  Procedure was followed.
[00:13:39.849 --> 00:13:42.211]  And they have my statement.
[00:13:42.271 --> 00:13:42.451]  Okay.
[00:13:50.032 --> 00:13:54.138]  You see, she doesn't want to talk about what's happened here, and we understand why.
[00:13:56.361 --> 00:13:56.621]  Usual.
[00:13:57.896 --> 00:13:58.676]  Usual procedure.
[00:13:59.256 --> 00:14:05.739]  You've got a judge who over the phone pronounces the Supreme Court Justice dead.
[00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:06.819]  We don't need to see anything.
[00:14:06.859 --> 00:14:07.519]  It's all done.
[00:14:08.179 --> 00:14:13.381]  You had two judges who passed this on because they couldn't physically go.
[00:14:13.821 --> 00:14:15.322]  She doesn't think it's important enough to go.
[00:14:15.742 --> 00:14:18.002]  She says we can talk to the local paper.
[00:14:18.022 --> 00:14:21.564]  I don't know if it's a livestock paper, what it is, to get their statements.
[00:14:21.664 --> 00:14:22.584]  She's given them a statement.
[00:14:22.604 --> 00:14:25.205]  She's not going to talk to anyone else except the local paper.
[00:14:25.925 --> 00:14:27.286]  I wonder what their relationship is.
[00:14:27.346 --> 00:14:28.787]  But she doesn't have a relationship with us.
[00:14:29.308 --> 00:14:31.489]  She doesn't want us to ask her any questions.
[00:14:31.549 --> 00:14:32.510]  That's what this is all about.
[00:14:33.591 --> 00:14:39.275]  Meanwhile, InfoWars reporter Joe Biggs also on the scene investigating all this.
[00:14:39.635 --> 00:14:50.203]  Well, he talked to a former deputy from the area and he says that the way local authorities handled the Scalia case was very irregular.
[00:14:50.714 --> 00:14:55.715]  So why do you think the ball was dropped, so to say, in dealing with Justice Scalia?
[00:14:55.975 --> 00:14:59.216]  You know, there was a body in a room at the Cibola Creek Ranch.
[00:14:59.576 --> 00:15:01.476]  No one was there when this happened, from what we've been told.
[00:15:02.296 --> 00:15:10.458]  Someone walks in, they see this guy laying there with a pillow over his face, over his head, however you want to put it, and the sheriff initially comes in, they call a few judges.
[00:15:11.058 --> 00:15:11.858]  No one can make it out.
[00:15:12.478 --> 00:15:16.539]  They contact the judge here, and she does an over-the-phone thing.
[00:15:16.599 --> 00:15:18.279]  Now, what would have you done differently?
[00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.472]  Again, I would have quarantined the area.
[00:15:21.692 --> 00:15:28.161]  Sorry, gathering the bed sheets, the pillows, everything that was there as evidence to get sent off to the labs for testing.
[00:15:28.982 --> 00:15:32.707]  And I would have requested the judge to give me an autopsy.
[00:15:33.908 --> 00:15:35.971]  See, this is the situation we have.
[00:15:36.571 --> 00:15:39.515]  You have a case where an illegal alien comes across the border.
[00:15:39.895 --> 00:15:50.728]  It's mandatory standard operating procedure for them to cordon off that area, gather evidence, submit that evidence, and then get a request or contact and try to get an autopsy done.
[00:15:51.089 --> 00:15:51.990]  And then we have this man
[00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.234]  Yes, I would have to say it is very irregular.
[00:16:07.935 --> 00:16:09.256]  Well, thank you for your time.
[00:16:09.696 --> 00:16:18.180]  Like you said, I mean, hopefully if you can win this race, you can become sheriff, you can make sure that these kind of situations and scenarios will be dealt with properly.
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:30.705]  And one thing you can always count on in a situation like this, especially if there is indeed a cover-up, and that is full cooperation and assistance from the mainstream media.
[00:16:31.005 --> 00:16:34.127]  Ever since we got details of Scalia's death,
[00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:37.850]  And started asking common sense questions.
[00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:46.917]  Well, it didn't take long for the establishment media to go into full attack mode and they started killing the messenger, so to speak.
[00:16:47.277 --> 00:16:50.860]  And of course, they're calling us the C word again.
[00:16:51.581 --> 00:16:52.722]  Conspiracy theorist.
[00:16:53.182 --> 00:17:02.908]  In fact, if you do a Google search and type in Justice Scalia conspiracy theories, well, you are going to get a ton of results with our name on it in full wars.
[00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:11.793]  And of course, Alex Jones, who the Washington Post says is the vector of universal conspiracy theories.
[00:17:12.774 --> 00:17:26.263]  They are trying to discredit and ridicule anyone who dares to question the official narrative of the bizarre and strange circumstances surrounding the death of Justice Scalia.
[00:17:26.623 --> 00:17:39.572]  See there, they even put us alongside space aliens and a group of wackos who think that Leonard Nimoy faked his death to join the Illuminati and kill Obama.
[00:17:39.852 --> 00:17:42.054]  I guess we're supposed to be with that group.
[00:17:42.614 --> 00:17:44.234]  So you won't take us serious.
[00:17:45.015 --> 00:17:47.375]  It is guilt by association.
[00:17:47.735 --> 00:17:49.255]  And I know you're not going to fall for it.
[00:17:49.295 --> 00:17:51.516]  For the most part, I'm preaching to the choir here.
[00:17:51.716 --> 00:17:55.377]  Our audience is very intelligent and wide awake.
[00:17:55.657 --> 00:18:03.158]  But unfortunately, there are still lots of people out there who are gullible enough to believe in these hit pieces.
[00:18:03.298 --> 00:18:06.659]  I guess you could say they are very naive.
[00:18:21.365 --> 00:18:23.827]  My father's no different than any other powerful man.
[00:18:25.768 --> 00:18:28.891]  Any man who's responsible for other people.
[00:18:30.412 --> 00:18:31.853]  Like a senator or a president.
[00:18:32.934 --> 00:18:34.515]  You know how naive you sound.
[00:18:34.715 --> 00:18:34.995]  Why?
[00:18:35.535 --> 00:18:37.837]  Senators and presidents don't have men killed.
[00:18:39.699 --> 00:18:39.959]  Oh.
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.561]  Who's being naive, Kay?
[00:18:43.481 --> 00:18:45.963]  Fool me once, shame on you.
[00:18:46.824 --> 00:18:49.185]  Fool me twice, shame on me.
[00:18:50.464 --> 00:18:51.245]  Vote for Jeb?
[00:18:51.985 --> 00:18:53.506]  Well, you're just f***ing stupid.
[00:18:56.808 --> 00:18:58.830]  Fool me, we can't get fooled again.
[00:19:10.766 --> 00:19:12.068]  We believe in win-win, folks.
[00:19:12.128 --> 00:19:13.869]  Treating people like we want to be treated.
[00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.634]  That's why we developed IntraCeuticals with Dr. Group and other top researchers, chemists, scientists, you name it.
[00:19:18.794 --> 00:19:19.735]  He's one of our advisors.
[00:19:20.016 --> 00:19:25.481]  To come up with products like AnthroPlex that is an original product that he made just for us.
[00:19:26.422 --> 00:19:28.384]  And this is a base
[00:19:29.298 --> 00:19:34.120]  system to make super male or super female vitality work even better.
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.180]  It is natural.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.482]  It just helps get your body pumping and going in the way you need to be going.
[00:19:40.882 --> 00:19:54.566]  And Dr. Group is here until we go to break to tell us about the latest product at InfoWarsLife.com, AnthroPlex, that out of the gates, and we do this all the time with the new product, we discount it out of the gates to get you to try it, knowing that you're going to love it.
[00:19:55.566 --> 00:19:56.187]  It'll sell out.
[00:19:56.527 --> 00:20:07.295]  So, Infowarslife.com, Anthroplex, 15% off and free shipping for the next two days only when you get it with Supermail or Female Vitality.
[00:20:07.435 --> 00:20:08.215]  Let's go to Dr. Group.
[00:20:08.396 --> 00:20:14.240]  Why do you call this the foundation to start the fire and then the Supermail takes you to the next level?
[00:20:15.455 --> 00:20:32.302]  Well, we just look at the base problem that's going on right now all over the world, which is the endocrine-disrupting chemicals, the amount of estrogen that men have, the femininity of men, and what's going on even in children right now with low testosterone levels.
[00:20:32.782 --> 00:20:33.443]  We're good to go!
[00:21:00.939 --> 00:21:02.800]  What is in the goat weed?
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.300]  You've got one of the purest, strongest organic forms of it.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.921]  What's so magic about the goat weed?
[00:21:20.225 --> 00:21:33.334]  Well, the horny goat weed was given that name because years ago in India, they noticed that a certain time of the year, this weed would grow and the goats would eat it and they would just go crazy with all the female goats.
[00:21:33.414 --> 00:21:34.935]  So that's how it was developed.
[00:21:34.955 --> 00:21:35.896]  It's called epimidium.
[00:21:36.696 --> 00:21:43.400]  And what that's been proven to do over thousands of years is increase sexual pleasure, help balance the male hormones.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.181]  It can actually be used for women as well.
[00:21:45.621 --> 00:21:52.485]  But it really kind of resets and brings the hormone balance, improves sperm motility, and increases testosterone levels.
[00:21:52.505 --> 00:21:54.506]  So it counters the stuff they've been throwing at us.
[00:21:54.766 --> 00:21:55.866]  Results will vary.
[00:21:55.946 --> 00:21:58.588]  Overall, all I know is dynamite.
[00:21:59.028 --> 00:22:03.893]  I mean, absolutely dynamite with the stamina, with the weight lifting, with the swimming.
[00:22:04.133 --> 00:22:09.137]  Folks, the new product is available, AnthroPlex, available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:09.498 --> 00:22:11.640]  Dr. Group, thank you for developing this amazing product.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.080]  Thank you.
[00:23:02.562 --> 00:23:04.744]  Who are you working for, brother?
[00:23:05.444 --> 00:23:05.945]  Same people.
[00:23:06.505 --> 00:23:07.687]  What do you mean, same people?
[00:23:07.827 --> 00:23:09.708]  InfoWars.com InfoWars.com?
[00:23:09.808 --> 00:23:10.549]  I've never heard of it.
[00:23:10.589 --> 00:23:11.890]  It sounds like a very powerful group.
[00:23:17.628 --> 00:23:24.651]  Look who's talking about the importance of releasing the classified 28 pages of the 9-11 Commission Report.
[00:23:25.211 --> 00:23:25.871]  You guessed it.
[00:23:26.212 --> 00:23:27.332]  It's Donald Trump.
[00:23:27.692 --> 00:23:29.233]  Who blew up the World Trade Center?
[00:23:29.553 --> 00:23:30.673]  It wasn't the Iraqis.
[00:23:30.713 --> 00:23:31.634]  It was Saudi.
[00:23:31.654 --> 00:23:32.934]  Take a look at Saudi Arabia.
[00:23:32.974 --> 00:23:33.875]  Open the documents.
[00:23:34.235 --> 00:23:41.438]  We ought to get Bush or somebody to have the documents opened because, frankly, if you open the documents, I think you're going to see that it was Saudi Arabia.
[00:23:41.898 --> 00:23:44.260]  They did not knock down the World Trade Center, okay?
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.282]  It wasn't the Iraqis that knocked down the World Trade Center.
[00:23:47.783 --> 00:23:51.786]  We went after Iraq, we decimated the country, Iran's taken over, okay.
[00:23:52.206 --> 00:23:53.767]  But it wasn't the Iraqis.
[00:23:54.608 --> 00:23:59.432]  You will find out who really knocked down the World Trade Center, because they have papers in there that are very secret.
[00:23:59.572 --> 00:24:02.014]  You may find it's the Saudis, okay?
[00:24:02.474 --> 00:24:03.415]  But you will find out.
[00:24:03.655 --> 00:24:11.919]  This morning on the Alex Jones Show, political insider Roger Stone had this to say about the incriminating 28 pages.
[00:24:12.399 --> 00:24:15.841]  We know that a number of the hijackers trained in Tampa, Florida.
[00:24:16.361 --> 00:24:23.725]  We know that the neighbors tipped the local police and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement under Jeb Bush.
[00:24:24.045 --> 00:24:24.746]  And what happened?
[00:24:25.246 --> 00:24:25.706]  Nothing.
[00:24:25.766 --> 00:24:29.248]  Instead, Jeb Bush helped the Bin Ladens get on planes and get out of the country.
[00:24:30.089 --> 00:24:34.851]  You know, and for the Bush lackeys to now claim that it's outrageous.
[00:24:34.891 --> 00:24:37.812]  Look, Condoleezza Rice had multiple warnings.
[00:24:38.532 --> 00:24:41.513]  The Central Intelligence Agency had multiple warnings.
[00:24:41.793 --> 00:24:44.174]  The FBI had multiple warnings.
[00:24:44.294 --> 00:24:47.876]  But within the Bush administration, they weren't speaking to each other.
[00:24:48.296 --> 00:24:51.277]  That is a failure of leadership, or it's willful.
[00:24:51.817 --> 00:24:56.339]  One or the other, whether it's incompetence or treason, is meaningless at this point.
[00:24:56.519 --> 00:25:04.230]  Recently, Jeb Bush was confronted again by Infowars and once again refused to talk about the documents.
[00:25:04.851 --> 00:25:07.955]  Last week I asked you about the 28 pages that were redacted.
[00:25:08.076 --> 00:25:09.698]  Yeah, you haven't sent them to me.
[00:25:09.718 --> 00:25:11.781]  I don't know anything about them yet.
[00:25:11.801 --> 00:25:13.083]  Can you ask W to help us get them?
[00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:15.310]  I don't know what you think.
[00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:16.531]  What's the implication of it?
[00:25:16.551 --> 00:25:17.772]  What are you talking about?
[00:25:17.812 --> 00:25:18.132]  Thank you.
[00:25:18.172 --> 00:25:19.433]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:25:19.453 --> 00:25:19.573]  28th.
[00:25:19.753 --> 00:25:20.494]  Yeah, where is it from?
[00:25:20.554 --> 00:25:21.954]  It's from the 9-11 Commission report.
[00:25:22.335 --> 00:25:24.176]  Well, eventually they'll come out, won't they?
[00:25:24.256 --> 00:25:25.076]  Well, we hope so.
[00:25:25.116 --> 00:25:27.798]  If you could ask your brother to get them for us, that'd be great.
[00:25:27.818 --> 00:25:28.779]  Well, I'll see him one more time.
[00:25:28.999 --> 00:25:41.366]  Well, there's the Bush dynasty for you, making jokes at the expense of the 9-11 victims' families, who simply want answers to why their loved ones died on September 11th.
[00:25:41.906 --> 00:25:44.148]  It's getting blatantly obvious to everyone
[00:25:44.468 --> 00:25:45.308]  I love my dad.
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:04.381]  I'd kill for him.
[00:26:05.061 --> 00:26:06.983]  I'd go to prison for him because I love him so much.
[00:26:07.323 --> 00:26:17.270]  And what's hidden from the public in the classified documents of the 28 pages is a link between the Saudi government and the 9-11 hijackers.
[00:26:17.711 --> 00:26:24.416]  And we're talking funding and training of the terrorist who launched an attack on our country on September 11, 2001.
[00:26:26.397 --> 00:26:32.580]  This was an act of war, not to mention treason by the Bush administration.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.962]  And they don't want anybody to see what's in those 28 pages.
[00:26:38.248 --> 00:26:43.131]  Governor Bush was wondering about the use of eminent domain with the Texas Rangers stadium.
[00:26:43.311 --> 00:26:44.071]  Yeah, that was wrong.
[00:26:44.532 --> 00:26:45.292]  That's a private use.
[00:26:45.312 --> 00:26:46.393]  That would be an example of it.
[00:26:46.653 --> 00:26:47.573]  Who are you working for, brother?
[00:26:48.294 --> 00:26:48.774]  Same people.
[00:26:49.354 --> 00:26:50.175]  What do you mean, same people?
[00:26:50.255 --> 00:26:51.355]  Infowars.com.
[00:26:51.676 --> 00:26:52.556]  Infowars.com?
[00:26:52.636 --> 00:26:53.357]  I've never heard of it.
[00:26:53.417 --> 00:26:55.057]  Is it like a very powerful group?
[00:26:55.138 --> 00:26:55.958]  Infowars.com?
[00:26:55.978 --> 00:26:56.418]  Infowars.com?
[00:26:58.544 --> 00:27:00.045]  Well, thanks for the plug, Jeb.
[00:27:00.605 --> 00:27:04.347]  Maybe you should check out some of the articles on InfoWars.com.
[00:27:04.768 --> 00:27:09.730]  This way you don't look like such a dumbass when somebody asks you a serious question.
[00:27:10.051 --> 00:27:19.316]  By the way, for those of you who missed out the first time InfoWars caught up with Jeb and asked him about the 28 pages, here's InfoWars reporter Richard Reeves.
[00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:21.050]  You doing well?
[00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:22.311]  Excellent.
[00:27:22.751 --> 00:27:23.332]  Good to see you.
[00:27:24.232 --> 00:27:24.693]  Governor Bush!
[00:27:24.813 --> 00:27:25.213]  How we doing?
[00:27:25.233 --> 00:27:25.613]  Good to see you, man.
[00:27:25.633 --> 00:27:25.893]  Alright, good.
[00:27:25.913 --> 00:27:26.233]  How you doing?
[00:27:26.974 --> 00:27:31.757]  I was wondering, would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9-11 Commission report?
[00:27:31.777 --> 00:27:33.057]  Would you be one to see those released?
[00:27:33.077 --> 00:27:34.578]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[00:27:34.598 --> 00:27:34.958]  You got them?
[00:27:35.799 --> 00:27:37.420]  Well, hopefully we can get them.
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.240]  Thank you.
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.803]  Would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9-11 Commission report?
[00:27:42.823 --> 00:27:44.084]  Would you be one to see those released?
[00:27:44.884 --> 00:27:45.604]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[00:27:45.624 --> 00:27:45.985]  You got them?
[00:27:46.825 --> 00:27:47.765]  Well, we may have them.
[00:27:47.785 --> 00:27:48.466]  Hopefully we can get them.
[00:27:48.666 --> 00:27:48.966]  Thank you.
[00:27:49.246 --> 00:27:53.168]  For the few who have seen them, they're known as the 28 pages.
[00:27:53.548 --> 00:27:59.951]  In those pages are names of people who allegedly helped the Al-Qaeda killers, but who have never been held accountable.
[00:28:00.271 --> 00:28:04.733]  Potential sources of foreign support for the September 11th hijackers.
[00:28:05.453 --> 00:28:07.515]  Classified by the Bush administration.
[00:28:07.615 --> 00:28:12.120]  Why the 28 pages remain hidden from the public remains a mystery.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:17.866]  We know the 28 pages from Senator Graham and Senator Jones that have seen it, and military we've had on that have seen it.
[00:28:18.127 --> 00:28:20.970]  It says Saudi Arabia ran the attacks to blame Iraq.
[00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:21.931]  That was always the plan.
[00:28:22.531 --> 00:28:24.433]  And then our own government, bare minimum, stood down.
[00:28:24.533 --> 00:28:25.675]  And of course it was more than that.
[00:28:26.115 --> 00:28:30.098]  But we have the fact that it now, to a great extent, was an inside job.
[00:28:30.358 --> 00:28:35.121]  I have read the 28 pages and the 28 pages have nothing to do with national security.
[00:28:35.361 --> 00:28:35.681]  Nothing.
[00:28:35.861 --> 00:28:36.842]  I wouldn't be standing here.
[00:28:37.362 --> 00:28:40.184]  It's all about relationships and involvement in 9-11.
[00:28:40.525 --> 00:28:43.226]  I want those documents declassified.
[00:28:43.306 --> 00:28:47.049]  I'm embarrassed to be associated with a work product.
[00:28:48.151 --> 00:28:48.891]  That is secret.
[00:28:49.192 --> 00:29:00.157]  I am convinced that there was a direct line between at least some of the terrorists who carried out the September 11th attacks and the government of Saudi Arabia.
[00:29:00.557 --> 00:29:02.438]  He called it a smoking gun.
[00:29:02.819 --> 00:29:09.282]  And he went on to say the reason for this cover-up goes right up to the White House.
[00:29:09.642 --> 00:29:11.263]  This is sort of shocking when you read it.
[00:29:11.423 --> 00:29:13.444]  As I read it, we all had our own experience.
[00:29:14.059 --> 00:29:25.227]  I had to stop every couple pages and just sort of absorb and try to rearrange my understanding of history for the past 13 years and the years leading up to that.
[00:29:25.828 --> 00:29:28.570]  It challenges you to rethink everything.
[00:29:29.218 --> 00:29:33.419]  What do we know is in the 28 censored pages of the 9-11 report?
[00:29:33.739 --> 00:29:36.119]  People that have seen it said it would bring down the whole system.
[00:29:36.459 --> 00:29:40.040]  I've met with and talked to multiple members of Congress who read it.
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.241]  They are convinced the American people need to see it.
[00:29:42.261 --> 00:29:48.582]  It has to do with information which is not convenient to the White House, either White House, the Clinton White House or the Bush White House.
[00:29:49.022 --> 00:29:55.463]  And it has to do with an ally, but since it looked the other way, it allowed a lot of support for the terrorists who conducted the attack.
[00:29:55.543 --> 00:29:58.904]  We're here today to call for the release of those 28 pages.
[00:29:59.755 --> 00:30:08.722]  The survivors, civilian heroes, and families of the victims of September 11th terrorist attacks, some of whom are here today, deserve the full truth.
[00:30:09.262 --> 00:30:20.411]  We cannot let page after page of blanked out documents be obscured behind a veil, leaving these families to wonder if there is additional information surrounding these horrible acts.
[00:30:20.731 --> 00:30:25.855]  My son, Matthew C. Salido, was murdered September 11th, 2001.
[00:30:28.507 --> 00:30:31.988]  On September 11th, I lost my husband Tom Strada.
[00:30:32.388 --> 00:30:40.130]  My husband Victor was the captain of United Flight 175 that struck the South Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11th at 9.03 a.m.
[00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:47.551]  My father never got to see me compete on my horse, cheer me on at a lacrosse game, or hear me speak at my middle school graduation.
[00:30:48.171 --> 00:30:54.673]  When you tell me there's a security risk and that's the reason
[00:30:56.607 --> 00:30:58.988]  You're not making these public?
[00:31:00.148 --> 00:31:05.149]  Mr. President, I call you a liar.
[00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:08.130]  He would be laughing and saying, you go get him, Terry.
[00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:09.170]  You go get him.
[00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:11.411]  Don't let them get away with this.
[00:31:11.531 --> 00:31:12.851]  Don't let them hide the truth.
[00:31:13.291 --> 00:31:16.632]  And don't let the people that were behind it not pay.
[00:31:16.812 --> 00:31:21.553]  Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make.
[00:31:22.994 --> 00:31:24.074]  Either you are with us,
[00:31:25.506 --> 00:31:26.787]  Well, you are with the terrorists.
[00:31:29.049 --> 00:31:29.510]  Governor Bush.
[00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:29.990]  How we doing?
[00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:30.431]  Good to see you, man.
[00:31:30.451 --> 00:31:30.691]  Alright, good.
[00:31:30.731 --> 00:31:31.051]  How you doing?
[00:31:31.792 --> 00:31:36.497]  I was wondering, would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9-11 Commission report?
[00:31:36.517 --> 00:31:36.697]  Yes, sir.
[00:31:36.717 --> 00:31:37.858]  Would you be willing to see those released?
[00:31:38.659 --> 00:31:39.400]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:39.740]  Got them?
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:44.565]  When I dream of my wedding day, I will carry his picture and wish he were there with me.
[00:31:44.585 --> 00:31:45.626]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[00:31:45.666 --> 00:31:45.906]  Got them?
[00:31:46.526 --> 00:31:48.548]  My son's dead.
[00:31:49.907 --> 00:31:52.108]  And I don't know all the facts.
[00:31:52.488 --> 00:31:53.229]  Yeah, I'd like to see him.
[00:31:53.249 --> 00:31:53.589]  You got him?
[00:31:54.009 --> 00:31:58.492]  Keeping it a secret about those who facilitated it must end now.
[00:31:59.292 --> 00:32:00.413]  Uh, well, Andrea may have him.
[00:32:00.433 --> 00:32:01.653]  Hopefully we can get him.
[00:32:01.793 --> 00:32:08.537]  Thank you.
[00:32:10.898 --> 00:32:13.379]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.440]  It just pancaked.
[00:32:15.721 --> 00:32:18.242]  Well, pancaking almost like a precision enclosure.
[00:32:22.654 --> 00:32:31.007]  It's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[00:32:46.946 --> 00:32:49.512]  This is an American president.
[00:32:49.853 --> 00:32:50.995]  Just add puppet.
[00:32:51.376 --> 00:32:53.641]  Then vote and repeat every four years.
[00:33:14.893 --> 00:33:17.355]  This is Bernie Sanders and I'm quite upset.
[00:33:17.555 --> 00:33:24.298]  If you guys saw the Iowa Caucus the other night, you would know that I worked extremely hard for these votes.
[00:33:24.598 --> 00:33:30.761]  And the people that were working in the Iowa Caucus took what I worked hard for and gave it to someone else.
[00:33:31.081 --> 00:33:36.063]  A lying, cheating, horrible human being by the name of Hillary Clinton.
[00:33:38.244 --> 00:33:42.146]  I don't understand how anybody could like something like this.
[00:33:42.226 --> 00:33:54.492]  That you work hard for something your whole life and you earn something and then you're expected to give it to someone else who's not as deserving and is too lazy or more of a piece of crap than you are.
[00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:57.613]  What kind of person would even think about something like that?
[00:33:57.873 --> 00:34:01.235]  Hey, that'd be you, Bernie Sanders.
[00:34:01.475 --> 00:34:02.536]  Guess you just felt the Bern.
[00:34:03.656 --> 00:34:06.657]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:06.858 --> 00:34:07.478]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.301]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[00:34:14.641 --> 00:34:18.184]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:34:18.444 --> 00:34:21.067]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:34:21.387 --> 00:34:24.830]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:28.734]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts.
[00:34:28.854 --> 00:34:29.174]  I'm good.
[00:34:53.069 --> 00:34:54.110]  We're good to go.
[00:35:12.617 --> 00:35:18.719]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about a potential Fort Hood situation?
[00:35:18.759 --> 00:35:22.041]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:35:22.061 --> 00:35:23.801]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:35:23.841 --> 00:35:30.104]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:35:30.204 --> 00:35:36.106]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:35:36.246 --> 00:35:40.028]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:35:40.208 --> 00:35:43.169]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:35:43.289 --> 00:35:51.292]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:35:51.573 --> 00:35:53.613]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:35:53.673 --> 00:35:54.714]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:35:55.054 --> 00:36:03.822]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:37:25.791 --> 00:37:27.712]  You talk about leveling with the American people.
[00:37:27.752 --> 00:37:28.832]  Have you always told the truth?
[00:37:29.112 --> 00:37:29.953]  I've always tried to.
[00:37:30.653 --> 00:37:30.953]  Always.
[00:37:31.573 --> 00:37:31.853]  Always.
[00:37:32.754 --> 00:37:34.654]  For me to say, have I ever?
[00:37:34.794 --> 00:37:35.975]  I don't believe I ever have.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.240]  I don't believe I ever have.
[00:37:38.321 --> 00:37:39.421]  I don't believe I ever will.
[00:37:39.521 --> 00:37:41.982]  I'm going to do the best I can to level with the American people.
[00:37:53.186 --> 00:37:56.188]  Using a secret private server to hang under sniper fire.
[00:37:56.368 --> 00:38:03.132]  There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles.
[00:38:03.352 --> 00:38:05.393]  Problem is, that's not what happened.
[00:38:05.733 --> 00:38:06.574]  And we should know.
[00:38:06.914 --> 00:38:11.377]  CBS News accompanied the First Lady and daughter Chelsea on that Bosnia trip.
[00:38:11.517 --> 00:38:14.979]  That's Senator Clinton talking to me on the military flight into Tuzla.
[00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:18.961]  And these are the pictures we recorded of the greeting ceremony when the plane landed.
[00:38:19.161 --> 00:38:21.166]  I remember landing under sniper fire.
[00:38:21.447 --> 00:38:22.730]  There was no greeting ceremony.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.201]  To Turkey?
[00:38:25.441 --> 00:38:34.428]  Whitewater, Watergate, defending a rapist, threatening all of Bill's bimbos in an effort to keep them quiet, then claiming to run a campaign for women.
[00:38:34.808 --> 00:38:43.475]  I really just want everybody to take a deep breath and relax and just, you know, sit back because here they come again.
[00:38:43.535 --> 00:38:49.900]  We're going to have to just ride through this as we have so many of these other false accusations.
[00:38:50.231 --> 00:38:54.975]  Using the Clinton Foundation as a cover for tax evasion and taking bribes from foreign countries.
[00:38:55.215 --> 00:39:01.681]  She talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
[00:39:02.302 --> 00:39:07.886]  Well, I know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy and we have yet to know who that is.
[00:39:07.906 --> 00:39:09.428]  Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger, that's for sure.
[00:39:09.448 --> 00:39:10.348]  That's fine, that's fine.
[00:39:10.809 --> 00:39:17.755]  She claims to be against the big banks, yet won't release the transcripts of the speeches she made to those banks who paid her hefty speaking fees.
[00:39:17.895 --> 00:39:19.857]  Another conspiracy theory.
[00:39:19.957 --> 00:39:26.382]  And after turning Libya into chaos, Clinton wants to dispel the notion that as Secretary of State, she led the U.S.
[00:39:26.422 --> 00:39:27.943]  intervention that toppled Gaddafi.
[00:39:27.963 --> 00:39:29.244]  I think you're underselling yourself.
[00:39:29.304 --> 00:39:42.895]  You got the State Department on board, you convinced the President, you overcame the objections of Vice President Biden and Secretary of Defense Gates, the National Security Council, and you had another obstacle then, and that was the United Nations.
[00:39:43.136 --> 00:39:45.818]  And you were able to persuade the Russians, of all things,
[00:39:46.358 --> 00:39:48.518]  He came, we saw, he died.
[00:39:49.059 --> 00:39:55.320]  Clinton even took $190,000 worth of household goods from the White House when Bill left office.
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.760]  I guess they were dead broke at the time.
[00:39:58.441 --> 00:40:00.941]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:40:01.201 --> 00:40:02.241]  I'm running for president.
[00:40:02.641 --> 00:40:05.842]  Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
[00:40:06.102 --> 00:40:10.223]  I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
[00:40:25.242 --> 00:40:42.605]  Mrs. Hillary Clinton, former Nelson Rockefeller campaign staff member, Saul Alinsky neophyte, First Lady cuck queen, New York Wall Street guard dog senator, treasonous Secretary of State, and now sickly presidential candidate.
[00:40:42.785 --> 00:40:47.429]  The red carpet Hillary thought she walked in on is quickly being rolled back up.
[00:40:47.649 --> 00:41:02.042]  An Associated Press GFK poll shows that 72% of registered Democratic voters are leaning towards Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, a 21% jump since the poll was taken less than three months ago.
[00:41:02.222 --> 00:41:08.025]  Liberal stalwart Salon Magazine is even declaring Hillary's campaign to be on its last legs.
[00:41:08.285 --> 00:41:12.188]  Meanwhile, Hillary's public presence is a slow-motion disaster.
[00:41:12.508 --> 00:41:18.871]  Hillary told Scott Pelley of CBS News that she tries not to lie to the American people, whatever that means.
[00:41:18.911 --> 00:41:20.872]  You talk about leveling with the American people.
[00:41:20.912 --> 00:41:21.973]  Have you always told the truth?
[00:41:22.273 --> 00:41:23.133]  I've always tried to.
[00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:28.136]  And even Britney Spears deleted her recent endorsement of the Clinton campaign.
[00:41:28.536 --> 00:41:37.560]  But the real question plaguing Hillary's now-desperate presidential bid isn't her giant sham of a platform or her trail of deception.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.101]  It's Hillary herself.
[00:41:43.683 --> 00:41:46.644]  In the administration, we assume you won't be...
[00:41:55.908 --> 00:41:59.132]  Yeah, but you talk.
[00:42:10.606 --> 00:42:13.269]  She may not even be fit to take office.
[00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:30.650]  Jerome Corsi of WorldNetDaily reports, the concussion Hillary Clinton suffered in December of 2012 that led to a serious blood clot requiring hospitalization may also have caused her to suffer post-concussion syndrome with symptoms including confusion, headaches and dizziness.
[00:42:31.087 --> 00:42:48.799]  Florida Physician, Dr. Daniel Casasea, a dual board certified osteopathic neurologist and a leading headache specialist who directs the Florida Headache and Movement Disorder Center in Sarasota, Florida, told World Net Daily, Dr. Casasea pointed to the published incidents that the World Net Daily had previously reported on,
[00:42:57.324 --> 00:42:58.185]  Thanks for watching!
[00:43:17.077 --> 00:43:19.200]  She's wearing those glasses again.
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:31.114]  As far back as 2013, two of Hillary's assistants, Huma Abedin and Monica Hanley, said it was very important to go over phone calls with Hillary because she was often confused.
[00:43:31.514 --> 00:43:36.881]  And then there was the odd five-minute bathroom break at the third Democratic debate in New Hampshire.
[00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:43.563]  Hillary was actually sitting off stage recovering from dizziness, fatigue, and disorientation.
[00:43:43.823 --> 00:43:49.665]  Hillary Clinton is nothing less than a New World Order puppet of a very dark order.
[00:43:50.105 --> 00:43:57.788]  May the providence invested by the good people of the United States prevent Hillary Clinton from wielding the highest power on Earth.
[00:43:58.408 --> 00:44:00.349]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.764]  For the latest from South Carolina, Richard Reeves.
[00:44:11.305 --> 00:44:15.490]  By the way, I like the Peter Prince haircut, the Blackwater haircut.
[00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:16.411]  You look sharp, Richard.
[00:44:16.691 --> 00:44:17.172]  I like that.
[00:44:17.672 --> 00:44:19.334]  You're there with a big ol' cannon in the background.
[00:44:19.354 --> 00:44:21.457]  You got an aircraft carrier there in the background.
[00:44:21.817 --> 00:44:23.359]  Looks like 4th of July or something.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.182]  What has developed since we checked in with you yesterday?
[00:44:26.903 --> 00:44:29.885]  Well Alex, more has developed than we have time to even talk about.
[00:44:30.005 --> 00:44:31.466]  We are here at Patriot's Point.
[00:44:31.686 --> 00:44:44.274]  Right behind me is the USS Yorktown and the main difference between that ship that is now a museum and the GOP establishment is that it sits upright and it's afloat because the GOP establishment is in big trouble, buddy.
[00:44:44.694 --> 00:44:56.822]  And it's good news for us, because one thing that Roger Stone didn't get to mention, because he didn't know about it, because I know the mainstream media doesn't want to talk about it, is because Marco Rubio pulled another big, giant absentee showing last night.
[00:44:57.142 --> 00:45:05.348]  They had in Greenville, South Carolina, they had a three-candidate event with Marco Rubio scheduled with Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.
[00:45:06.168 --> 00:45:12.309]  5,000 ardent conservatives showed up and Marco Rubio went out.
[00:45:12.569 --> 00:45:13.270]  He was afraid.
[00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:15.270]  It was too much Ted Cruz in the crowd.
[00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:23.652]  He's backed out of that event and we know he did because what happened was is Matt, my cameraman and I, we were at a Rubio event earlier in the day.
[00:45:24.372 --> 00:45:28.693]  Trey Gowdy, Tim Scott, Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina and
[00:45:29.409 --> 00:45:35.314]  The governor of South Carolina, they were all tied at the hip with Marco Rubio all day long.
[00:45:35.795 --> 00:45:50.208]  Well, Tim Scott and Craig Gowdy for sure showed up at that event last night, and they were willing to be surrogates in Marco Rubio's place, and to the event of the credit, to the credit of the organizers of the event, they said no because they had disallowed a surrogate for Jeb Bush days ago.
[00:45:50.248 --> 00:45:51.389]  They said no, we're not having surrogates.
[00:45:51.409 --> 00:45:54.552]  So the big angle is Rubio in no show, chickens out of the bait.
[00:45:56.067 --> 00:45:59.390]  The headline is, Rubio peed his pants.
[00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:00.030]  Well, that's right.
[00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:03.053]  You know, he's famous for being absent on Senate votes.
[00:46:03.433 --> 00:46:08.017]  Well, I tell you what, what's going to happen when he has a face down with Putin or some other important world leader?
[00:46:08.357 --> 00:46:12.481]  So let's not forget this because Alex... Maybe he can sit on Putin's knee and ask for Christmas presents.
[00:46:13.682 --> 00:46:14.302]  Unbelievable.
[00:46:14.362 --> 00:46:19.567]  So, obviously, Alex, has this been reported in the national press in Austin at all?
[00:46:20.325 --> 00:46:23.928]  No, I would get the data over to one of our writers and have him get a story out.
[00:46:24.709 --> 00:46:25.109]  That's it.
[00:46:25.149 --> 00:46:34.157]  Well, we uploaded a video earlier talking about it, and so that's posted now, but it's called Another Bonafide for Trump, Another Absence for Rubio.
[00:46:34.197 --> 00:46:36.579]  So folks, watch that YouTube video on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:46:36.599 --> 00:46:37.440]  Richard, we're going to break.
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:38.440]  What else are we learning?
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.962]  I mean, I see the polls are all over the place.
[00:46:40.002 --> 00:46:43.224]  Do you think it's accurate that Trump is still gaining more and more every day?
[00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:45.372]  Well, thank you, Pope.
[00:46:45.672 --> 00:46:46.453]  Thank you, Pope.
[00:46:46.513 --> 00:46:47.335]  That's another thing.
[00:46:47.695 --> 00:46:54.625]  South Carolina Christians are pretty offended over the Pope's comments that Trump's not a Christian because conservatives here, they want a wall, too.
[00:46:54.685 --> 00:46:57.148]  They want illegal immigration controlled.
[00:46:57.469 --> 00:47:00.113]  So they took it as a personal offense, Alex.
[00:47:02.992 --> 00:47:04.013]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.554 --> 00:47:06.837]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.117 --> 00:47:14.946]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.588]  We're good.
[00:49:06.664 --> 00:49:07.885]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:49:07.905 --> 00:49:18.695]  I'm David Knight, your host, and joining me now is Wayne Madsen as well as our reporters who went with us to West Texas to investigate the hotel where Antonin Scalia died.
[00:49:18.975 --> 00:49:21.997]  Joe Biggs and Kit Daniels will be joining us as well.
[00:49:22.017 --> 00:49:26.902]  We're also going to have a clip from the interview that Michael Savage had with Joe Biggs.
[00:49:26.942 --> 00:49:32.186]  Before we get into the Scalia death and the investigation that we did there, Wayne, I want to ask you.
[00:49:33.007 --> 00:49:38.414]  What do you make of the fact that Donald Trump is now talking about the missing pages from 9-11?
[00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:45.674]  Well, he's certainly talking about something that no other candidate would even think about delving into.
[00:49:46.235 --> 00:49:47.656]  Most of all, Jeb Bush.
[00:49:48.016 --> 00:49:49.037]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[00:49:49.278 --> 00:49:49.738]  He avoided that.
[00:49:49.758 --> 00:49:55.243]  His family, of course, has a lot of reasons to keep that information secret.
[00:49:55.263 --> 00:50:04.531]  I think Trump is starting to even be more open about what he thinks about
[00:50:05.316 --> 00:50:08.877]  What's wrong with this country that even H. Ross Perot was?
[00:50:09.197 --> 00:50:09.758]  Oh, I think so.
[00:50:09.918 --> 00:50:11.458]  Very much so, yeah.
[00:50:11.578 --> 00:50:15.620]  Perot, of course, also fed on a lot of discontent.
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:21.502]  But Trump has done a couple of things here that I think are interesting.
[00:50:21.982 --> 00:50:32.646]  Not only is he basically overthrowing the Republican Party establishment, and Sanders is doing it for other reasons on the Democratic side.
[00:50:33.542 --> 00:50:40.584]  But he's also, he was ruled out by all the political professionals last year.
[00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:43.785]  Every time he made some controversial statement he said, that's it, he's done.
[00:50:44.385 --> 00:50:47.006]  When he went after McCain and other things.
[00:50:47.666 --> 00:50:52.408]  He's probably going to destroy the professional political consultants.
[00:50:53.268 --> 00:50:58.370]  The advertising, political advertising consultants, because he's... Oh yeah, it's not having any effect.
[00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:00.511]  They've spent hundreds of millions of dollars for Jeb Bush.
[00:51:00.531 --> 00:51:04.092]  He came in with this massive war chest that that was supposed to scare all the competition away.
[00:51:04.352 --> 00:51:07.393]  He's spent most of it now and it hasn't done anything for him.
[00:51:07.854 --> 00:51:08.474]  Absolutely.
[00:51:08.694 --> 00:51:15.757]  Trump says he spent five million dollars, whereas Jeb has wasted 140 million at least.
[00:51:16.737 --> 00:51:21.779]  And if this is the case, if Trump wins South Carolina, which it looks like he's going to do,
[00:51:22.339 --> 00:51:22.419]  Yes.
[00:51:37.668 --> 00:51:41.951]  All I need is a Twitter account, a Facebook page, and, you know, a website.
[00:51:42.051 --> 00:51:44.633]  Because that's basically how he's getting his message across.
[00:51:44.893 --> 00:51:48.656]  I think that's a key part of what's going on with both his campaign and Sanders' campaign.
[00:51:48.696 --> 00:52:02.586]  The fact that people are able to get the news directly, they're able to bypass and are more and more willing to bypass the established mainstream media and get their information directly from the candidates, get it from alternative sources to make up their own minds and do their own research.
[00:52:02.606 --> 00:52:05.729]  And that's really what we're trying to do with this investigation.
[00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:10.292]  I don't have any conspiracy theories about how Antonin Scalia died.
[00:52:10.413 --> 00:52:16.818]  I am skeptic of the various stories that we've heard, which they're conflicting with each other, that have been offered by the government.
[00:52:16.938 --> 00:52:22.122]  I don't think that it, you know, you don't become a conspiracy theorist simply because you're a skeptic.
[00:52:22.142 --> 00:52:23.623]  You want to see a criminal investigation.
[00:52:23.663 --> 00:52:27.046]  Since when is a criminal investigation a conspiracy theory?
[00:52:27.106 --> 00:52:27.566]  It's not.
[00:52:27.687 --> 00:52:31.189]  We should have an investigation to rule out criminal actions.
[00:52:31.269 --> 00:52:32.991]  That's not a theory being offered.
[00:52:33.351 --> 00:52:34.011]  Absolutely.
[00:52:34.031 --> 00:52:40.014]  And the thing is, without the autopsy, there's going to be questions obviously raised.
[00:52:40.114 --> 00:52:47.878]  And even those who are dismissing the idea that there was foul play involved are saying, well, why wasn't there an autopsy?
[00:52:49.218 --> 00:52:51.279]  There's so many aspects to this story.
[00:52:51.659 --> 00:52:57.202]  But even the Washington Post, which only really exists in Washington, D.C., to shoot down
[00:52:57.982 --> 00:52:58.062]  Yes.
[00:53:16.099 --> 00:53:25.892]  Uh, day, weekend, uh, at this secluded ranch out in the middle of nowhere, where you have to sign a waiver, uh, over the medical issue.
[00:53:25.912 --> 00:53:25.992]  Yeah.
[00:53:26.012 --> 00:53:26.973]  There's no medical.
[00:53:26.993 --> 00:53:28.075]  You have to sign a waiver.
[00:53:28.115 --> 00:53:33.122]  All of us had to sign a waiver when we went in there saying that we acknowledge that there's no medical help for ours.
[00:53:33.522 --> 00:53:39.525]  We know that people are coming to this ranch to engage in physical activities like whale hunting, horseback riding, ATV riding, okay?
[00:53:39.825 --> 00:53:40.345]  All of this stuff.
[00:53:40.545 --> 00:53:51.330]  So all of that brings to question the stories about his particular health, okay, that we've heard, as well as what was really happening at the ranch.
[00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:52.330]  And you've got a story about that.
[00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:53.651]  We're going to talk about that in detail.
[00:53:53.911 --> 00:53:59.553]  I want to bring in our other reporters who are also joining us from the Situation Room, Joe Biggs and Kit Daniels.
[00:53:59.594 --> 00:54:11.559]  Give us your quick take on what you think behind the Trump exposure of the missing pages, calling out the Bush family for being liars about the weapons of mass destruction.
[00:54:12.239 --> 00:54:12.760]  Thank you, David.
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:16.703]  I think it's exceptionally great that he is doing that.
[00:54:17.103 --> 00:54:24.509]  You know, I was more, like you said, on Rand Paul's side, and now that he's out, there's really nowhere else to look other than Donald Trump.
[00:54:24.569 --> 00:54:32.716]  And the fact that he's coming out, he's willing to put himself out there, make himself a target, and he has made himself a target by bringing up the situation with the 28 pages.
[00:54:34.858 --> 00:54:49.301]  It's unprecedented to see someone like this, a candidate running for this position, for President of the United States, and seeing him coming out, hitting hard, going after the Pope when the Pope attacks him, you know, going after the Bush family, going after the Clintons.
[00:54:49.761 --> 00:54:55.102]  You know, I'm moving up too as far as, you know, my wanting to back Donald Trump.
[00:54:55.162 --> 00:55:01.764]  I think he's doing some amazing stuff now, you know, his unfiltered view on the world and how he gets up there and says what he wants.
[00:55:02.864 --> 00:55:04.705]  I believe he's going to do some great stuff for America.
[00:55:04.725 --> 00:55:05.145]  What do you think?
[00:55:05.445 --> 00:55:09.366]  Yeah, I think it's really key that he's got a very unfiltered view of the world.
[00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:14.787]  I mean, most politicians, when you see in a general election, there's always something that's off limits for all of them to talk about.
[00:55:14.807 --> 00:55:18.668]  I think even in the 90s and 92 when Bill Clinton and George H.W.
[00:55:18.708 --> 00:55:24.570]  Bush were running against each other, they had a gentleman's agreement not to talk about the sub scandal they had going on in Arkansas about guns.
[00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:28.211]  And I think it was at the time that that's what it was.
[00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:29.692]  But it's yeah, it's great.
[00:55:29.732 --> 00:55:31.113]  He's talking about 28 pages.
[00:55:31.133 --> 00:55:37.516]  That's typically something that's completely off limits for any politician, no matter what kind of election you're running to talk about.
[00:55:37.536 --> 00:55:41.238]  I mean, even like in a local like county commissioner, you can't talk about 9-11.
[00:55:41.258 --> 00:55:42.838]  You're going to get run out of office.
[00:55:43.579 --> 00:55:52.063]  So he's really kind of pushing the Overton window, like I've said before, about what he what politicians are are allowed to say.
[00:55:52.123 --> 00:55:54.404]  That's not going to kill them in the election in the polls.
[00:55:55.128 --> 00:55:59.052]  Yeah, it's weird because anytime I've ever spoke to any kind of political person, it's always got to be off-record.
[00:55:59.092 --> 00:56:02.055]  They'll kind of be like, you know, we watch your show, or, you know, we agree with this.
[00:56:02.075 --> 00:56:09.903]  This is the first time I've seen a candidate, someone in this position, with this kind of power, this kind of social pull, so to say, to actually come out
[00:56:10.564 --> 00:56:16.065]  And hard charge these issues, really important issues that Americans should be concerned about.
[00:56:16.105 --> 00:56:20.386]  I mean, the fact that he's saying, hey, if I if I'm elected president, I'm going to give you the information.
[00:56:20.406 --> 00:56:22.447]  You're going to know who brought down those towers.
[00:56:22.467 --> 00:56:25.747]  And like you said, Iraq, Saddam Hussein, nothing to do with it.
[00:56:26.047 --> 00:56:30.068]  I think the key thing, let me break in here quickly, Joe and Kit.
[00:56:30.548 --> 00:56:33.669]  I think the key thing with this, too, for me is, as I said before,
[00:56:34.469 --> 00:56:38.574]  I'm very much interested in shutting down the attacks on our civil liberties.
[00:56:38.634 --> 00:56:39.935]  But where did they all begin?
[00:56:40.336 --> 00:56:41.737]  They all began with 9-11.
[00:56:41.917 --> 00:56:46.963]  That was always the basis for, well, we have to take all of your freedoms, we have to shut down the Constitution, because 9-11.
[00:56:47.463 --> 00:56:53.971]  If the people understand that they have been lied to, that the basis of the security state
[00:56:54.531 --> 00:56:55.071]  Is a lie.
[00:56:55.632 --> 00:56:56.392]  That is huge.
[00:56:56.753 --> 00:56:58.254]  And so, that is a key thing.
[00:56:58.634 --> 00:57:05.539]  If he will attack on that particular basis and say, you've got these pages that you're not releasing, let us see that.
[00:57:05.639 --> 00:57:09.022]  And he's already called out Jeb Bush on lying about weapons of mass destruction.
[00:57:09.442 --> 00:57:15.186]  It's amazing to me that he would get booed for that at the GOP debate because everybody knows that it was based on a lie.
[00:57:15.206 --> 00:57:18.709]  Do you think it was a smart play though, David, for him to come out now and say that?
[00:57:19.029 --> 00:57:23.833]  Or do you think he should have waited until, you know, maybe after he wins the election possibly?
[00:57:24.213 --> 00:57:35.941]  No, I think he should do it right now because I think it's going to, look, when he called out, regardless of what happens with the 9-11 issue, a lot of people, most people don't realize there are missing pages from the 9-11 report that had not been released.
[00:57:35.961 --> 00:57:38.482]  They don't realize that congressmen have wanted to see that as well.
[00:57:38.722 --> 00:57:40.724]  So I think that's very important to get that on the table.
[00:57:40.764 --> 00:57:47.548]  But everybody knows that the weapons of mass destruction lie, the basis of Iraq, they all know that that was a lie.
[00:57:47.608 --> 00:57:48.669]  To call him out on that,
[00:57:49.289 --> 00:57:53.631]  Gives him stature that he did not have before in a lot of people's eyes.
[00:57:53.692 --> 00:57:58.714]  In terms of my viewpoint, it gave Trump a great deal of stature to call out Jeb on those lines.
[00:57:58.734 --> 00:57:59.335]  What do you think, Wayne?
[00:57:59.495 --> 00:58:00.856]  Well, think of something else here.
[00:58:00.956 --> 00:58:06.639]  Trump is a major real estate developer in New York City, especially Manhattan.
[00:58:07.139 --> 00:58:09.701]  He's been in this game for a long, long time.
[00:58:10.121 --> 00:58:12.242]  He knows all the players.
[00:58:12.262 --> 00:58:17.125]  He knows a lot about the World Trade Center from the time it was being built.
[00:58:17.925 --> 00:58:25.356]  And so, you know, we have Bloomberg, for example, threatening to get in because he doesn't like Trump.
[00:58:25.577 --> 00:58:25.777]  Yeah.
[00:58:26.338 --> 00:58:28.962]  And Trump doesn't really care for him, I guess.
[00:58:29.503 --> 00:58:32.667]  But Bloomberg's friend is Larry Silverstein, who
[00:58:34.155 --> 00:58:36.477]  All right, folks, that's going to do it for tonight's broadcast.
[00:58:36.517 --> 00:58:40.679]  By the way, today is the 71st anniversary of Iwo Jima.
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:43.101]  God bless the greatest generation.
