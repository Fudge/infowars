[00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:22.036]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.096 --> 00:00:25.806]  It is Thursday, April 7th, 2016, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.087 --> 00:00:27.010]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:30.404 --> 00:00:30.804]  Tonight.
[00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:31.765]  Mayday!
[00:00:31.885 --> 00:00:32.386]  Mayday!
[00:00:32.786 --> 00:00:40.492]  CNN freaks out over the Alex Jones plan to assemble a protest at the Republican National Committee.
[00:00:40.652 --> 00:00:48.498]  To let people feel the pressure of the American people and those who have bothered to vote in these primaries and caucuses.
[00:00:48.518 --> 00:00:51.560]  Yeah, we're the victims that they're openly robbing as we speak.
[00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:53.262]  That sounds slightly ominous.
[00:00:53.342 --> 00:00:55.343]  I mean, is that the way you want the delegates counted?
[00:00:56.244 --> 00:01:07.914]  Iranian hackers attempted a cyber attack on the United States, but the public didn't learn about the cyber crimes until after Obama's nuclear deal with Iran.
[00:01:08.415 --> 00:01:12.438]  And guess who's triggering the social justice warriors this time?
[00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:18.083]  It's Thomas the Tank Engine, because he doesn't have enough black friends.
[00:01:18.684 --> 00:01:19.244]  Racist!
[00:01:19.724 --> 00:01:23.548]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:03.151 --> 00:03:06.573]  Well, a homicide has hit close to home here in Austin, Texas.
[00:03:06.613 --> 00:03:12.457]  The body of an 18-year-old freshman was found on the campus at University of Texas here in Austin.
[00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:16.760]  The identity of the student has been released, 18-year-old Haruka Weiser.
[00:03:17.481 --> 00:03:19.442]  She was a first-year theater and dance student.
[00:03:19.482 --> 00:03:19.842]  I think?
[00:03:39.403 --> 00:03:49.486]  They're saying it's a black male, approximately 6 feet tall, and a $15,000 reward is being offered for any information that would lead to an arrest of this man.
[00:03:49.986 --> 00:03:58.769]  Now, it's very interesting considering this happened at UT because we have this whole anti-campus carry protest happening with a gun-free UT.
[00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:03.852]  Perhaps if this girl had been armed with reason, she'd be alive right now.
[00:04:04.272 --> 00:04:13.397]  Now, I attended one of these protests, and these people were in an uproar out there, making a mockery of Campus Carry with fart blasters and dildos.
[00:04:13.898 --> 00:04:21.622]  And this is the exact reason why Michael Cargill and others with Campus Carry Texas fought to get this bill passed.
[00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:23.623]  Now, I spoke with Michael Cargill.
[00:04:24.104 --> 00:04:25.985]  He's the owner of Central Texas Gunworks.
[00:04:26.545 --> 00:04:31.208]  About why he was fighting so hard for Campus Carry, and here's what he had to say.
[00:04:32.829 --> 00:04:35.771]  Campus Carry is something that's near and dear to my heart.
[00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:40.133]  My grandmother decided that at 70 years old, she was going to go to college to get her college degree.
[00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:42.455]  My grandmother only got a high school education.
[00:04:42.835 --> 00:04:46.477]  At 70, she decided she wanted to become a nurse, so she went to college.
[00:04:46.897 --> 00:04:53.862]  While my grandmother was traveling from a college library, sitting at a bus stop waiting for a bus to come, a guy came along, mugged her, and raped her.
[00:04:54.602 --> 00:04:59.166]  And I decided at that point I would make sure that every female in my family had tools they needed to protect themselves.
[00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:00.728]  So this is not a joke.
[00:05:01.128 --> 00:05:02.009]  This is not a joke for me.
[00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:06.293]  This is something I've been working for for over 10 years to get passed in this state.
[00:05:06.553 --> 00:05:17.883]  And I do not want clowns making a mockery of what we worked so hard for to get passed and we need a nice smooth transition because there are other things that we want to get passed in this session down the road.
[00:05:18.103 --> 00:05:19.144]  Right, exactly.
[00:05:19.224 --> 00:05:29.850]  And that was one of the things that you mentioned to me when I saw you Saturday, was just that, you know, this campus carry isn't about some kid in a classroom taking down a mass shooter.
[00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:37.215]  That's not what this was about, because A, they're not going to have the training necessary to take down a mass shooter, most likely.
[00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:38.916]  This is about self-defense.
[00:05:39.116 --> 00:05:40.877]  Yes, this is about my personal protection.
[00:05:40.917 --> 00:05:42.257]  This is about your personal protection.
[00:05:42.517 --> 00:05:44.258]  This is a license to carry a handgun.
[00:05:44.518 --> 00:05:48.940]  This is not about somebody being a one-armed security team trying to clear an entire building.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.860]  This is not about that.
[00:05:50.181 --> 00:05:55.303]  This is about your individual personal protection and protection of your family and to protect yourself to stop someone from killing you.
[00:05:56.083 --> 00:05:57.244]  That is what this is all about.
[00:05:57.424 --> 00:06:00.605]  Not to be made a mockery of or anything else.
[00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.275]  Well, the establishment media is once again having a freakout over Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:14.642]  Here, on CNN, they aired his interview with Roger Stone and their plan to assemble at the Republican National Convention.
[00:06:15.322 --> 00:06:16.984]  That sounds slightly ominous.
[00:06:17.064 --> 00:06:19.026]  I mean, is that the way you want the delegates counted?
[00:06:19.557 --> 00:06:21.418]  Look, I mean, he said he doesn't want violence.
[00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:22.539]  No one wants violence.
[00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:23.380]  There's no place for that.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.320]  He said that explicitly.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.743]  I think he's just trying to say, I want this to be transparent.
[00:06:27.783 --> 00:06:28.844]  And I think that's fair.
[00:06:28.964 --> 00:06:30.845]  At least, oh, that's the people.
[00:06:30.885 --> 00:06:35.468]  When you have the most of the American people going to vote for Donald Trump, we at least owe transparency.
[00:06:35.488 --> 00:06:36.909]  What about what Katie said?
[00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:37.970]  The rules are the rules.
[00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.712]  And these rules have been in place for a while now.
[00:06:40.752 --> 00:06:41.913]  This is just how it's done.
[00:06:42.093 --> 00:06:43.715]  Sure, but can we step back and question?
[00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:57.047]  So the fact that the establishment media is covering this plan to stop the steal just shows that they are terrified by the very idea that the voters might show up and try to influence the delegates there.
[00:06:57.588 --> 00:07:03.091]  I mean, I guess you need to be paying a lot more money to get the Republican delegates to do your bidding.
[00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:07.032]  If you're a voter, if you're one of the American people, don't you dare show up.
[00:07:07.092 --> 00:07:08.353]  How insulting!
[00:07:08.433 --> 00:07:09.674]  How dare you!
[00:07:10.114 --> 00:07:17.778]  Now, something else that the establishment is really concerned about, and they want to keep a lid on, is Obama's nuclear deal with Iran.
[00:07:18.078 --> 00:07:22.840]  In fact, the Justice Department kept the public in the dark about Iranian hackers
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.221]  Until that deal was completed.
[00:07:25.702 --> 00:07:31.065]  On March 24th, the Department of Justice indicted seven Iranian hackers for two cybercrimes.
[00:07:31.385 --> 00:07:34.047]  The charges result from the individual's attacks on U.S.
[00:07:34.127 --> 00:07:38.109]  bank websites and the breach of a New York dam's control systems.
[00:07:38.489 --> 00:07:42.512]  Hmm, that's, oh no, nothing to worry about there, taking over the dam's systems.
[00:07:42.952 --> 00:07:50.493]  Now, even though this indictment was just released to the public, it had originally been announced and then immediately sealed the same week that the U.S.
[00:07:50.513 --> 00:07:53.814]  and Iran were implementing agreements regarding Iran's nuclear program.
[00:07:54.354 --> 00:08:06.757]  Now, the Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, she said last week that the Department of Justice is sending a powerful message that they will not allow any individual group or nation to sabotage American financial institutions.
[00:08:07.097 --> 00:08:08.797]  But of course, you know, she's saying that
[00:08:09.517 --> 00:08:14.720]  These charges illustrate that cyber hacking or attacks of any sort will not be tolerated by the U.S.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:22.383]  government, and this is after they're showing their firm hand with giving them this Iranian nuclear deal.
[00:08:22.824 --> 00:08:30.608]  Now, Iran's cyber capabilities have only been growing exponentially for the past six years, and victims of that include not only U.S.
[00:08:30.828 --> 00:08:33.269]  military, but also private sectors.
[00:08:33.749 --> 00:08:33.889]  I don't
[00:08:52.321 --> 00:08:53.221]  Tearing it down.
[00:08:53.641 --> 00:09:01.544]  Now, of course, Europe is actually having to admit that they allowed in a jihadist Trojan horse that they were warned about.
[00:09:01.944 --> 00:09:03.564]  Now, this is being reported by the U.K.
[00:09:03.584 --> 00:09:10.226]  Telegraph, and they say terrorists are using the migration crisis to enter Europe and plot atrocities across the continent.
[00:09:10.566 --> 00:09:10.746]  I don't
[00:09:27.017 --> 00:09:27.577]  I don't think so.
[00:09:55.555 --> 00:09:56.375]  You think so?
[00:09:56.916 --> 00:09:57.776]  You were warned.
[00:09:58.016 --> 00:10:10.520]  But once again, they're telling us to not trust our instincts, not listen to ourselves, not worry about these red flags, and to tell us that we have no idea what we're talking about, that we're being racist, sexist, whatever.
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:17.783]  Oh, here, by the way, here's just some random video for you of a refugee threatening to throw a baby
[00:10:18.143 --> 00:10:18.583]  I don't think so.
[00:10:38.052 --> 00:10:53.501]  Yesterday, we talked about how because of situations like this, where we're having to deal with potential ISIS, jihadi sympathizers and the like infiltrating the TSA, Port of Authority, other types of things, they're now putting on these surprise terror drills, which
[00:10:54.241 --> 00:10:59.644]  Sounds like a terrible idea, and the Port Authority supervisors there seem to agree.
[00:10:59.664 --> 00:11:01.526]  I mean, what's the worst that could happen, right?
[00:11:01.846 --> 00:11:12.052]  Well, I wanted to go out to the streets of Austin today, just ask your average tourist out here in Austin if they think that this is really insane to just have a surprise terror drill.
[00:11:32.596 --> 00:11:33.576]  What do you think about that?
[00:11:33.836 --> 00:11:47.200]  There was a surprise terror drill in New Jersey, and the Port Authority didn't know about it, the police didn't know about it, and so people were calling saying, hey, there's some suspicious activity, and so they rushed there thinking they're gonna need to go guns-a-blazin'.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.881]  Do you think surprise terror drills are a smart idea?
[00:11:50.901 --> 00:11:50.941]  No.
[00:11:53.342 --> 00:11:57.664]  What do you think, if here in Texas with open carry, what would you do?
[00:11:59.404 --> 00:12:00.104]  What would I do?
[00:12:00.945 --> 00:12:01.285]  I don't know.
[00:12:01.445 --> 00:12:07.007]  We haven't seen one yet, so I would probably, and I don't carry a gun, so I'd probably run and hide.
[00:12:07.027 --> 00:12:08.668]  It'd be scary.
[00:12:09.268 --> 00:12:09.548]  Yeah.
[00:12:10.328 --> 00:12:12.989]  Would you feel compelled to respond or do something?
[00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:14.950]  Probably, yeah.
[00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:16.570]  Would you be frightened?
[00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:17.851]  How would you respond?
[00:12:19.792 --> 00:12:20.732]  Maybe frightened?
[00:12:22.416 --> 00:12:23.577]  I don't really know.
[00:12:23.597 --> 00:12:24.017]  It's happened.
[00:12:24.137 --> 00:12:30.079]  It's a little frightening, but it'd be interesting if they could give you a little bit of warning, maybe?
[00:12:30.099 --> 00:12:35.082]  Well, I have 13 and 15 year old daughters, and that, they would be totally freaked out.
[00:12:35.442 --> 00:12:35.762]  Yeah.
[00:12:36.582 --> 00:12:37.563]  Yeah, they'd be really scared.
[00:12:37.903 --> 00:12:41.224]  What could potentially be the worst thing that could happen in a surprise terror drill?
[00:12:42.545 --> 00:12:46.246]  Somebody would take it for real, obviously, and then it would be a terror drill.
[00:12:46.687 --> 00:12:49.828]  You'd have the people doing the drill being the terrorists at that point.
[00:12:51.035 --> 00:12:52.015]  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:12:52.035 --> 00:12:53.056]  Yeah.
[00:12:53.296 --> 00:12:55.757]  If something really, really bad happened.
[00:12:56.077 --> 00:12:58.819]  Like a self-fulfilling drill.
[00:12:58.919 --> 00:13:01.220]  You used to hide behind the walls.
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.821]  You used to hide behind desks.
[00:13:04.861 --> 00:13:11.745]  So I want you to know I can see through your masks.
[00:13:11.865 --> 00:13:14.866]  You used to never have done nothing.
[00:13:16.607 --> 00:13:18.568]  But failed to destroy.
[00:13:28.228 --> 00:13:36.195]  Now, speaking of another mass exodus, we've been reporting about how millionaires are fleeing their cities due to potential civil unrest.
[00:13:36.515 --> 00:13:41.960]  Well, now we can also report that millionaires are fleeing Chicago over the fear of civil unrest.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.244]  They are panicked over potential race riots and, of course, the crime wave.
[00:13:46.744 --> 00:13:56.367]  About 3,000 individuals with net assets of a million dollars or more, and that's not including their primary residence, moved from the city just last year.
[00:13:56.687 --> 00:14:02.869]  And most of those people cited rising racial tensions and worries about crime as factors in the decision.
[00:14:03.249 --> 00:14:09.691]  Now, Chicago is third on the list of the cities that are experiencing this exodus of millionaires behind Paris and also Rome.
[00:14:10.351 --> 00:14:16.133]  Now, we've previously highlighted the fact that it's this increasing wealth inequality
[00:14:16.733 --> 00:14:25.338]  In addition to the rise of extreme protest movements like Black Lives Matter that are providing this toxic cocktail, they were saying last year was going to be the summer of rage.
[00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:29.101]  Of course, it seems as though that's continuing on into this summer.
[00:14:29.461 --> 00:14:35.145]  We've reported that they're installing panic rooms in their big city apartments due to fears over this potential civil unrest.
[00:14:36.185 --> 00:14:39.328]  So, you know, the world is, of course, a very scary place right now.
[00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:41.650]  But, you know, don't let me tell you that.
[00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:48.396]  I'm a white lady, so that means that I'm super racist for even talking about this potential crime, and Black Lives Matter.
[00:14:48.756 --> 00:14:53.861]  So I'm going to let former NFL player Ray Lewis talk about Black Lives Matter.
[00:14:54.621 --> 00:15:03.028]  I'm trying to ask the question if, to an organization of black lives, if they really matter, then why not riot now?
[00:15:04.295 --> 00:15:09.639]  There was 141 murders this year, 82 murders last year at the same time.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:18.846]  I'm trying to figure out in my mind why no one is paying attention to black men killing black men.
[00:15:19.647 --> 00:15:23.030]  Why we always find ourselves as the victims.
[00:15:24.306 --> 00:15:29.369]  And of course it is the rising crime there in Chicago that is causing people to flee en masse.
[00:15:29.729 --> 00:15:37.034]  Now let's take a little flashback to the city that sort of lit the match for all of this civil unrest and these race riots, Ferguson.
[00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:47.780]  Now a lot of the issue there was with the policing, the police brutality, and now Ferguson, they did agree to police reform, but only if they could raise taxes on the citizens.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.002]  They wanted the citizens to pay for their police reform.
[00:15:51.542 --> 00:15:52.942]  So this was according to the St.
[00:15:52.962 --> 00:15:53.743]  Louis Dispatch.
[00:15:54.303 --> 00:16:13.267]  They did agree to the DOJ mandated police reform, but the city was experiencing a $2.5 million operating deficit last year and the budget fell by more than a million dollars after the DOJ forced Ferguson to stop using fines and tickets to balance the city budget.
[00:16:13.607 --> 00:16:19.249]  And so that was where a lot of the issue was stemming from in Ferguson is that they were targeting blacks and minorities.
[00:16:20.709 --> 00:16:37.535]  Charging them millions of dollars in fines and fees so it's more of a revenue rather than serving the public safety needs and this is what they're saying law enforcement has come to because of course cities across America use police to ticket citizens in order to balance the budget.
[00:16:37.575 --> 00:16:38.816]  So there you go, Ferguson.
[00:16:39.096 --> 00:16:41.517]  They'll stop harassing you, but you gotta pay for it.
[00:16:41.857 --> 00:16:49.462]  And it's very interesting that, you know, even though they're taking in all of this revenue, they still can't seem to balance the budget, much like the rest of the country.
[00:16:49.702 --> 00:16:54.545]  We're taking in record amount of taxes, and we are still in massive debt.
[00:16:55.105 --> 00:17:03.390]  And now, according to the Tax Foundation, Americans actually pay more in taxes than food, clothing, and housing combined.
[00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:09.414]  It takes now 46 days of the year for Americans to pay off their federal, state, and local
[00:17:10.114 --> 00:17:10.634]  Taxes.
[00:17:11.095 --> 00:17:11.775]  And guess what?
[00:17:12.776 --> 00:17:16.358]  Kids still want you to pay even more in taxes.
[00:17:16.479 --> 00:17:20.061]  Bernie says up to 75% so that they can get free college.
[00:17:20.381 --> 00:17:29.087]  So that they can go to school and become idiots like these people who panicked after confusing a priest with a KKK member.
[00:17:29.367 --> 00:17:30.468]  So they're tweeting this out.
[00:17:30.828 --> 00:17:31.769]  Take a look at that picture.
[00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:34.771]  Someone tweets that out and they say, Students, be careful.
[00:17:34.871 --> 00:17:38.574]  There's someone walking around in KKK gear with a whip.
[00:17:40.513 --> 00:17:41.254]  Oh my gosh.
[00:17:41.294 --> 00:17:43.535]  And so now they're tweeting out, can't you keep us safe?
[00:17:43.635 --> 00:17:44.276]  Oh my gosh.
[00:17:44.716 --> 00:17:47.238]  He was a Dominican friar.
[00:17:47.879 --> 00:17:56.305]  And so they, of course, poked fun at these highly intelligent college students who can't tell a priest from a KKK member poking fun at them.
[00:17:56.645 --> 00:17:57.446]  But that's not all.
[00:17:57.766 --> 00:18:06.212]  We also have these highly educated social justice warriors arguing that the new Thomas the Tank Engine movie is racist and sexist.
[00:18:06.573 --> 00:18:07.113]  That's right.
[00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:09.235]  It's the new film and
[00:18:10.015 --> 00:18:15.678]  Thomas the Tank has been given several diverse friends of different nationalities, but you know what?
[00:18:15.798 --> 00:18:25.103]  That's not good enough, it's not multicultural enough, it's racist, and the three female characters that have been introduced are sexist,
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:27.722]  I don't even know where to go with this.
[00:18:27.782 --> 00:18:36.814]  It seems like the more educated our country gets, the more insane they also get, and now they want you to pay for that education.
[00:18:37.615 --> 00:18:42.141]  It's not just the social justice warriors you have to worry about, but the technological zombies as well.
[00:18:42.341 --> 00:18:44.383]  Alex Jones will have that report coming right up.
[00:19:02.073 --> 00:19:05.797]  Please take a moment to listen to what I'm about to break down very, very carefully.
[00:19:06.518 --> 00:19:14.487]  Because the information I'm about to lay out in just two minutes changed my life and changed the life of many, many people around me.
[00:19:15.008 --> 00:19:21.376]  I was a big sports enthusiast, but loved to eat like a pig when I was 10 years old, up to about 22 or so.
[00:19:22.757 --> 00:19:28.102]  And I ran six miles every other day and lifted weights almost every day and had a great physique.
[00:19:28.262 --> 00:19:34.408]  Then I got into radio and television 21 years ago and got so busy in my work, I stopped working out.
[00:19:34.568 --> 00:19:39.193]  And everything was okay for four or five years, but then suddenly I started putting on pounds every month.
[00:19:39.493 --> 00:19:43.096]  And in the next 10 years, I gained almost 100 pounds.
[00:19:46.107 --> 00:19:56.459]  Then about seven years ago, I began jogging, swimming long distances, and lifting weights again, trying to lose weight, and was only able to lose about 20 of the 98 pounds.
[00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:58.040]  I even changed my diet.
[00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:59.742]  I even increased the exercise.
[00:19:59.762 --> 00:20:00.303]  It didn't work.
[00:20:01.144 --> 00:20:06.190]  But as soon as I began to get the nutrients and compounds that I needed
[00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:08.177]  My whole life changed.
[00:20:08.798 --> 00:20:14.844]  I've gone from 200 and almost 80 pounds down to about 220 pounds or so.
[00:20:15.445 --> 00:20:16.446]  It is incredible.
[00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:24.635]  And in just the last three years, Super Male Vitality, developed by Dr. Grube for mfulworthslife.com exclusively,
[00:20:25.315 --> 00:20:32.462]  And products like the Survival Shield X2 Nascent Ionine have just done incredible things for my body.
[00:20:32.623 --> 00:20:40.090]  I work out less, even though I'm older, I've lost more weight, my muscles got stronger, my stamina, my libido, and so much more.

[00:23:13.274 --> 00:23:19.959]  The momentum of the slippery slope to demolish our inherent rights protected by the First Amendment is picking up speed.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:30.848]  Back in January of 2014, federal prosecutors threw the book at author and documentary filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza for exaggerated campaign finance law violations.
[00:23:31.089 --> 00:23:31.929]  In September of 2014,
[00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:42.578]  D'Souza was sentenced to 5 years probation, 8 months in a halfway house, a $30,000 fine, community service, and mandatory therapy.
[00:23:42.818 --> 00:23:49.864]  Even the liberal Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz said the felony sentencing smacked of selective prosecution.
[00:23:50.144 --> 00:23:50.605]  Why?
[00:23:50.945 --> 00:23:59.152]  It just so happened that D'Souza had made a highly successful documentary criticizing President Barack Obama.
[00:23:59.452 --> 00:24:05.975]  Unfortunately, D'Souza's admission of guilt set the precedent for a newfound attack on the First Amendment.
[00:24:06.215 --> 00:24:09.336]  The liberals had tasted blood, and they wanted more.
[00:24:10.036 --> 00:24:22.942]  Matt Drudge had warned in 2015 that plans to take down conservative, i.e., right-wing, i.e., alternative media were gathering steam in the back rooms of Washington, D.C.
[00:24:23.402 --> 00:24:25.504]  They're getting ready for these decisions to come.
[00:24:25.524 --> 00:24:27.186]  You thought Obamacare was shocking.
[00:24:27.546 --> 00:24:29.348]  You thought some of these other decisions were shocking.
[00:24:29.408 --> 00:24:40.160]  Wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.181]  Then that will end for me.
[00:24:42.441 --> 00:24:44.162]  Fine, I've had a hell of a run.
[00:24:44.222 --> 00:25:03.535]  So when pro-life activist David Daleiden exposed Planned Parenthood's sale of fetal tissue via secret recordings and investigative techniques, the liberal Rockefeller-supported organization Planned Parenthood used the unchecked liberal inertia to slap Daleiden with a possible 22-year sentence.
[00:25:03.896 --> 00:25:08.699]  While beyond the embarrassment, no charges were ever filed against Planned Parenthood.
[00:25:09.059 --> 00:25:20.886]  Now documentary filmmaker Joel Gilbert, creator of the Obama expose, Dreams From My Real Father, faces a federal precedent-setting onslaught by the FEC.
[00:25:21.166 --> 00:25:36.916]  WorldNetDaily writes, in a case spotlighting regulation of conservative media, the three Democrats on the FEC alleged Gilbert violated reporting rules when he mailed out DVDs of his movie, Dreams From My Real Father, a story of reds and deception.
[00:25:37.156 --> 00:25:37.496]  We're good.
[00:25:52.073 --> 00:25:57.216]  All documentary films shown on television or the internet or broadcast over radio may be subject to criminal penalties, Gilbert said.
[00:26:19.631 --> 00:26:22.553]  The liberal line is being drawn in the sand.
[00:26:22.733 --> 00:26:36.923]  And as the Obama administration slowly reveals its teeth, their guard goes down as the possibility of their actions backfires into charges against their own criminal violations of the First Amendment.
[00:26:37.163 --> 00:26:42.166]  We are seeing nothing less than a witch hunt masquerading as a liberal agenda.
[00:26:42.386 --> 00:26:49.231]  It's not that they're breaking the laws, it's that the laws are so poorly designed that they allow people, if they've got enough lawyers and enough accountants,
[00:26:50.232 --> 00:26:55.196]  To wiggle out of responsibilities that ordinary citizens are having to abide by.
[00:27:07.096 --> 00:27:11.380]  But the conservatives will never oppose minimum wage on principle.
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.982]  They will only fight to keep it from being changed.
[00:27:14.002 --> 00:27:14.902]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:27:15.783 --> 00:27:18.405]  Is that they always fight to preserve the status quo.
[00:27:19.006 --> 00:27:21.568]  I'm concerned about individual liberty.
[00:27:21.588 --> 00:27:24.410]  That's why I'm a libertarian and not a conservative.
[00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.832]  But we can talk about that some other day in more detail.
[00:27:26.852 --> 00:27:28.374]  I want to talk about this delegate issue here.
[00:27:29.295 --> 00:27:33.298]  But of course, there's a lot of people who have different ideas about this.
[00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:37.982]  This is a way that conservatives are pushing this back and forth.
[00:27:38.002 --> 00:27:46.049]  Let's play this latest clip from Reince Priebus, the guy who has been telling us that, no, no, no, no, no, no, this isn't an election.
[00:27:46.069 --> 00:27:49.812]  You've got to understand, they are trying to join us, to join our party.
[00:27:50.232 --> 00:27:56.697]  We control the party, we dictate what the rules are going to be, and we change the rules at will, and we will put in there whoever we wish.
[00:27:56.757 --> 00:27:58.118]  Now he's talking about Kasich.
[00:27:58.178 --> 00:27:58.839]  Let's run that clip.
[00:27:59.119 --> 00:28:07.222]  Your opinion as the state chairman that the nominee of your party, are you confident tonight that it will be either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz?
[00:28:07.722 --> 00:28:08.442]  Are you confident?
[00:28:09.122 --> 00:28:13.564]  I think it, this is what I'll say, I think our nominee is going to be someone who's running, okay?
[00:28:13.604 --> 00:28:21.486]  I'm not going to, I'm not... Well there's three people running, I mean, mathematically John Casey can't catch up to them.
[00:28:21.746 --> 00:28:24.527]  You won't say for the record that it's either going to be Cruz or Trump?
[00:28:26.164 --> 00:28:28.847]  No, I'm gonna say it's gonna be someone that's running, Sean.
[00:28:28.867 --> 00:28:30.129]  I mean, I'm not gonna... Define running.
[00:28:30.189 --> 00:28:33.993]  Is running meaning... Does running mean it's either gonna be Cruz, Trump or Kasich?
[00:28:35.515 --> 00:28:38.439]  I think it's gonna be one of the three people running is going to be our nominee.
[00:28:38.499 --> 00:28:43.685]  And how does John Kasich get there without leapfrogging over people that have millions of more votes and hundreds of more delegates?
[00:28:45.515 --> 00:28:53.383]  You're gonna have to ask John Kasich, but I'm not gonna do something that's gonna be an affront right now to John Kasich.
[00:28:53.403 --> 00:28:56.446]  He's a good governor of Ohio, and he's running, and it's up to him.
[00:28:56.726 --> 00:29:02.431]  Now, that should tell you something about the Wisconsin primary, as they try to sell this narrative that...
[00:29:03.325 --> 00:29:05.867]  Donald Trump has crashed and burned because of Wisconsin.
[00:29:06.367 --> 00:29:10.389]  Reince Priebus is from Wisconsin, just like Paul Ryan.
[00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:13.471]  It is GOP establishment headquarters, folks.
[00:29:13.771 --> 00:29:18.714]  Now, when he says, well, I think it's going to be one of the three people running, he's not even going to be sure about that.
[00:29:18.994 --> 00:29:29.321]  But when he holds out for John Kasich, I want you to understand, as I pointed out last night on the nightly news, when you look at the remaining delegates, and you look at where they are in terms of the delegates that they have now,
[00:29:29.921 --> 00:29:35.986]  Donald Trump needs to get 65% of the remaining delegates to get to the magic threshold.
[00:29:36.847 --> 00:29:37.768]  Ted Cruz needs to get 82%.
[00:29:37.808 --> 00:29:37.768]  82%!
[00:29:38.008 --> 00:29:44.454]  Do you think you can do that with all the winner-take-all states that are coming up?
[00:29:44.974 --> 00:29:47.756]  Now, it gets even more ridiculous with John Kasich.
[00:29:47.917 --> 00:29:50.419]  John Kasich has so few delegates.
[00:29:50.439 --> 00:29:50.919]  It's 140-something.
[00:29:50.939 --> 00:29:52.120]  But he needs 146% of the remaining delegates.
[00:29:58.421 --> 00:30:06.287]  You know, he needs virtually, I think it's over 1,000 delegates that he needs, 1,100 or something delegates.
[00:30:07.408 --> 00:30:10.831]  But it's 140 some odd percent that John Kasich needs.
[00:30:10.871 --> 00:30:13.433]  You can't get more than 100% of the delegates.
[00:30:13.473 --> 00:30:21.439]  So what they're saying is, we're going to throw out the preferences of the voters in order to give John Kasich a chance.
[00:30:21.499 --> 00:30:25.222]  So he's still in play because we don't care what you voted for.
[00:30:27.031 --> 00:30:29.614]  In light of that, I want to talk about this story from WND.
[00:30:29.654 --> 00:30:36.080]  And as I mentioned with Alex, we've had Joseph Farah, the editor of WND, as well as Jerome Corsi, an excellent investigator.
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.221]  We've had them on multiple times.
[00:30:37.261 --> 00:30:38.722]  We agree with them on so much.
[00:30:39.003 --> 00:30:41.825]  They don't agree even within WND as to whether or not
[00:30:42.526 --> 00:30:46.007]  It's moral to take these delegates as Ted Cruz is doing.
[00:30:46.287 --> 00:30:55.351]  As they pointed out on Monday night, WND posted a column by their managing editor, David Kopelian, headlined, Is the Cruz campaign moral?
[00:30:55.591 --> 00:31:00.173]  And it documented that not only are Cruz operatives swarming over primary states that have been won by Donald Trump,
[00:31:00.993 --> 00:31:01.133]  I think?
[00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:26.391]  And he should have gotten a certain number of delegates.
[00:31:26.411 --> 00:31:30.673]  For example, in Arizona, Trump won in a landslide.
[00:31:30.693 --> 00:31:32.674]  47 to 25 percent.
[00:31:33.375 --> 00:31:33.715]  Okay?
[00:31:33.775 --> 00:31:37.257]  Gave him all 58 of the winner-take-all delegates there.
[00:31:37.937 --> 00:31:41.599]  Same thing happened in South Carolina, which wasn't even a winner-take-all state.
[00:31:42.099 --> 00:31:45.141]  Donald Trump won so resoundingly in South Carolina.
[00:31:45.181 --> 00:31:45.601]  You know the
[00:31:46.381 --> 00:32:05.746]  Southern part of the country where Ted Cruz is supposed to be so strong the place where they've got a lot of white Evangelicals it's supposed to be Ted Cruz's strength Donald Trump beat him there and got every single delegate because he won by such a large margin he got every single congressional district they allocated the Delegates based on congressional district because it was early in the process.
[00:32:05.786 --> 00:32:12.568]  They didn't allow winner-take-all and So Ted Cruz is going in and taking those delegates now
[00:32:13.607 --> 00:32:17.092]  Joseph Fair came back in and said, no, I think it is fair.
[00:32:17.193 --> 00:32:21.599]  He says it's just politics in his editorial.
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.363]  Coming back, they said they had a mass of comments.
[00:32:24.403 --> 00:32:27.007]  They had over 3,000 people commenting on that.
[00:32:28.263 --> 00:32:29.403]  I don't think it's just politics.
[00:32:29.443 --> 00:32:31.864]  You could say that lying is just politics.
[00:32:32.084 --> 00:32:32.664]  Because it is.
[00:32:32.684 --> 00:32:34.104]  It's a key part of it.
[00:32:34.164 --> 00:32:35.924]  You could say stealing is just politics.
[00:32:35.984 --> 00:32:38.285]  He says we live in a country of representative government.
[00:32:38.325 --> 00:32:42.946]  It doesn't always work well, but it's probably the best system of governance we can hope for.
[00:32:43.566 --> 00:32:45.446]  No, it's not about persuading people.
[00:32:45.526 --> 00:32:51.147]  It's as if you elected a Republican and a Democrat was chosen to go to Congress.
[00:32:51.947 --> 00:32:53.467]  And they've been doing that for a long time.
[00:32:53.607 --> 00:32:54.408]  They're called RINOs.
[00:32:54.428 --> 00:32:56.648]  We need to come up with a better word because they work for the globalists.
[00:33:02.335 --> 00:33:11.519]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important area of InfoWars that runs the whole operation that is having such a big effect against the globalists.
[00:33:12.359 --> 00:33:19.983]  And I've said it over and over again, it is you the listeners and the viewers that send us the intel, the news tips, that support the broadcast, that spread the word.
[00:33:20.883 --> 00:33:23.984]  You are 90% of the operation or more.
[00:33:24.024 --> 00:33:27.166]  You don't stand beside us, you stand at the heart of InfoWars.
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:06.061]  Look at these headlines.
[00:37:06.701 --> 00:37:09.343]  Samsung patents contact lenses with built-in cameras.
[00:37:09.363 --> 00:37:10.143]  CBS News.
[00:37:10.624 --> 00:37:15.086]  Brain zapping gadgets promise to make you better, smarter, stronger, even happier.
[00:37:15.126 --> 00:37:15.707]  Washington Post.
[00:37:17.093 --> 00:37:37.688]  And that headline about, oh, sending these different tweet signals via light and holograms through your brain cells, and it mind controls you, oh my gosh, with flickering light, this time not injected through the optic nerves, but directly into your brain stem.
[00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.771]  What's that Pentagon paper they had 20 years ago?
[00:37:43.312 --> 00:37:44.993]  The brain has no firewall?
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:53.702]  Forget smart glasses, Samsung patents, contact lenses, a built-in camera that projects images directly into the eye.
[00:37:54.302 --> 00:38:09.208]  Folks, this is beyond PKD's wirehead scenarios, and the people running the show are anti-human, nihilistic, parasitic monsters.
[00:38:11.121 --> 00:38:36.219]  Now, Eisenhower warned us that the technological elite that was in control of the military-industrial complex, in the full speech, not just the military-industrial complex, he said, beware the technological elite and the undue influence, whether sought or unsought, over the American people.
[00:38:37.222 --> 00:38:38.183]  It's a 21-minute speech.
[00:38:38.223 --> 00:38:38.923]  It's on YouTube.
[00:38:39.103 --> 00:38:39.684]  Go watch it.
[00:38:40.204 --> 00:38:41.926]  Farewell address.
[00:38:42.206 --> 00:38:41.926]  1961.
[00:38:42.326 --> 00:38:46.069]  And that's because they'd come to him at that point with this plan.
[00:38:46.709 --> 00:38:49.631]  It was already in place and much bigger than the Manhattan Project.
[00:38:50.872 --> 00:38:57.497]  To have a totally engineered, totally controlled, artificial world where people are obsolete.
[00:39:02.199 --> 00:39:10.985]  And where we're incrementally turned into jellyfish that can't stand up for ourselves, and where we don't have culture, we don't have chivalry, we don't have honor, we have nothing!
[00:39:13.387 --> 00:39:14.147]  And we collapse.
[00:39:14.387 --> 00:39:16.108]  Why did Forbes ask the question?
[00:39:16.188 --> 00:39:17.409]  So did the Associated Press.
[00:39:17.669 --> 00:39:19.711]  Why is there a war on lemonade stands?
[00:39:22.594 --> 00:39:24.775]  Another question in headlines.
[00:39:25.015 --> 00:39:26.755]  Why is there a war on farmers markets?
[00:39:27.115 --> 00:39:27.755]  Another headline.
[00:39:27.975 --> 00:39:29.896]  Why is there a war on Mennonites and Amish?
[00:39:30.156 --> 00:39:30.676]  Another headline.
[00:39:30.896 --> 00:39:32.696]  Why is there a war on gardens?
[00:39:32.796 --> 00:39:34.397]  Front yard, back yard, you name it.
[00:39:34.657 --> 00:39:36.277]  Why is there a war on urban gardens?
[00:39:37.397 --> 00:39:40.058]  Why is there a war on not taking vaccines?
[00:39:40.138 --> 00:39:43.239]  Why is there a war on contact sports?
[00:39:43.819 --> 00:39:45.019]  Why is there a nanny state?
[00:39:45.079 --> 00:39:46.379]  Why is there a war on language?
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.360]  There's a war on humanity.
[00:39:49.588 --> 00:39:52.130]  The globalists believe they're a breakaway species.
[00:39:52.671 --> 00:39:53.391]  They're attacking.
[00:39:53.631 --> 00:39:58.916]  And folks, I've got hundreds of articles here to cover super important stuff, but I go back to this because it's central.
[00:40:00.157 --> 00:40:01.778]  In fact, I hate to spring stuff on you.
[00:40:01.798 --> 00:40:02.939]  You guys do such a great job.
[00:40:05.021 --> 00:40:06.742]  We sent it out on our Twitter is the best way to find it.
[00:40:07.082 --> 00:40:12.186]  Drudge, a couple of months ago, Zuckerberg was walking at one of his presentations.
[00:40:13.327 --> 00:40:16.350]  Facebook's bought out that big virtual reality goggle company.
[00:40:18.402 --> 00:40:28.012]  And it shows thousands of his minions sitting there like slaves with the laptops and then they've got the goggles on and he's walking by with that predatory jackal grin.
[00:40:28.032 --> 00:40:38.062]  And Drudge put out a tweet saying, look out, feel the air, feel the water, you know, walk in the grass before it's too late.
[00:40:41.317 --> 00:40:50.923]  It's that what we're being wired into isn't even 1 100th as good as reality, and it doesn't get better, it gets worse by design.
[00:40:51.924 --> 00:40:59.649]  We're not being given this Promethean system to empower us, we're being given a twisted, jacked, poisoned bear trap.
[00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:04.052]  You stick your arm in here, you get it torn off.
[00:41:05.757 --> 00:41:15.812]  All the numbers, all the metrics, all the statistics, all the gauges, all the warning signs, all the red flags, all the red balloons, all the sirens are going off!
[00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:17.908]  Danger.
[00:41:18.129 --> 00:41:18.769]  Danger.
[00:41:18.969 --> 00:41:19.589]  Danger.
[00:41:19.769 --> 00:41:20.370]  Danger.
[00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:21.110]  Danger.
[00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:21.790]  Danger.
[00:41:21.911 --> 00:41:22.271]  Danger.
[00:41:22.631 --> 00:41:23.131]  Headline.
[00:41:23.151 --> 00:41:25.372]  Scream time causing children to be brain damaged.
[00:41:26.153 --> 00:41:27.353]  All top scientists agree.
[00:41:27.493 --> 00:41:28.334]  Limit screen time.
[00:41:28.374 --> 00:41:29.154]  Stop it altogether.
[00:41:29.775 --> 00:41:38.559]  The former owner of Apple, Steve Jobs, would not allow his children to have iPads or watch television, saying it was rewiring their brains and brain damaging them.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.720]  But he was pushing it on your kids.
[00:41:43.402 --> 00:41:43.902]  It's a plan.
[00:41:46.127 --> 00:41:48.329]  I told you this a hundred and something times over the years.
[00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:51.871]  I was allowed into the UT psychology department.
[00:41:53.653 --> 00:41:57.676]  I was allowed into the DARPA areas that said DARPA on the walls.
[00:41:57.756 --> 00:42:00.418]  It wasn't classified, but it was restricted.
[00:42:01.659 --> 00:42:10.085]  But they hide classified stuff in plain view and almost every lab that then was connected to remote offices around Texas and around the country.
[00:42:12.947 --> 00:42:26.516]  They'd fire up computers and there would be something out of a science fiction movie, the monkeys, the apes, the animals, with the TV sets flashing in their faces, testing brainwashing waves on you and your family, and then the wirehead monkeys sitting there.
[00:42:26.636 --> 00:42:27.837]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:42:28.878 --> 00:42:30.719]  And I mean, you're talking about people going, you want to see something?
[00:42:30.779 --> 00:42:32.380]  Flipping it on and going, you didn't see this here.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.822]  Not until I'm out of here and moved on to another university.
[00:42:36.703 --> 00:42:36.943]  I mean.
[00:42:38.752 --> 00:42:46.498]  The social engineers have engaged in societal brainwashing, fluoride in the water, additives to the plastics to reduce our fertility, to dumb us down.
[00:42:46.538 --> 00:42:54.384]  They've written published books like Ecoscience, published 1974 by the current White House science czar, admitting all of their plan.
[00:42:56.265 --> 00:42:57.846]  They have been dumbing the language down.
[00:42:57.886 --> 00:42:59.388]  They have been dumbing the media down.
[00:42:59.408 --> 00:43:00.829]  They have been dumbing the culture down.
[00:43:01.289 --> 00:43:06.313]  They have been turning the public basically into servile, backstabbing idiots with arrested development.
[00:43:07.355 --> 00:43:25.138]  Now they're moving ahead with weaponized flicker rates on the televisions, weaponized carrier waves, just like in the Kingsman, where the billionaire crazy wants to exterminate the population and joins with the elite, and then they send out a signal over the smartphones to basically make everybody start killing each other.
[00:43:25.678 --> 00:43:29.739]  That is a dumbed-down allegory of what they're actually doing, okay?
[00:43:30.619 --> 00:43:34.280]  That's why it's in every major movie you go see now that's science fiction based.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:35.940]  They're throwing it in your face.
[00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:38.470]  Now is Hollywood warning us?
[00:43:40.031 --> 00:43:41.872]  Or is Hollywood conditioning us?
[00:43:42.852 --> 00:43:51.855]  The people at the production level are very, very evil and are conditioning the population.
[00:43:52.415 --> 00:43:58.858]  But they cannot buck the directors and the writers and the people that believe they're putting a lot of this out to actually warn society.
[00:43:59.698 --> 00:44:00.758]  And how do I know that, folks?
[00:44:00.798 --> 00:44:03.859]  Because I've talked to a bunch of them and I'm going to leave it right there.
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:04.920]  In fact,
[00:44:06.118 --> 00:44:10.679]  I wish I could tell you the stuff I know about Hollywood, but it's been told to me in confidence.
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.381]  Part of what I've learned, I'm allowed to tell folks.
[00:44:14.841 --> 00:44:17.782]  I just can't say specifically who told me or the specifics.
[00:44:18.882 --> 00:44:30.305]  Like I was taken 10 years ago, 10 years ago, next month, and I was allowed to see the future of movies.
[00:44:30.625 --> 00:44:35.667]  Now since then, I've told people about it at the time, since then it's been rolled out partially.
[00:44:36.581 --> 00:44:43.463]  But James Cameron, who's moved to New Zealand by the way, we told you he was leaving when he believes in societal collapse.
[00:44:43.783 --> 00:44:44.984]  That wasn't in the news at the time.
[00:44:45.064 --> 00:44:46.984]  People made fun of me, now it's been confirmed.
[00:44:48.025 --> 00:44:58.508]  But they're going to pure holograms, where you'll go and a movie theater will be circular basically, and then the movie will go on in front of you and around you.
[00:44:59.108 --> 00:45:00.048]  And they've already got it.
[00:45:01.049 --> 00:45:05.650]  They're just getting all the licensing together and deciding how they're going to roll it out, how they're going to have people adopt it.
[00:45:07.441 --> 00:45:13.125]  They're gonna come out with the first wave of theaters where you show up and people are wearing goggles just to have the experience in their chair.
[00:45:14.225 --> 00:45:19.509]  And let me tell you, folks, there is massive subliminals and things being integrated into all of this.
[00:45:19.529 --> 00:45:21.650]  This is massively rewiring your brain.
[00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:24.872]  This is 100% CIA DARPA run.
[00:45:25.392 --> 00:45:29.895]  And at those levels with Hollywood, they publicly meet on a daily basis.
[00:45:30.936 --> 00:45:31.957]  And that used to be secret.
[00:45:32.057 --> 00:45:33.778]  They just hide everything in plain view now.
[00:45:34.738 --> 00:45:41.841]  And so they admit, oh, the government's spending billions working with Hollywood, and I don't mean letting Top Gun use an aircraft carrier.
[00:45:44.823 --> 00:45:46.363]  Or an F-14 Tomcat.
[00:45:47.684 --> 00:45:49.265]  So I'm gonna digress off this now.
[00:45:49.585 --> 00:45:51.206]  It's just, this is the big enchilada.
[00:45:51.806 --> 00:46:02.211]  You're being targeted to have your free will taken over and to be mesmerized, to be hypnotized, to be put into a near-sleep state, a sleepwalking trance.
[00:46:03.598 --> 00:46:07.840]  And if Infowars is here to do anything, I'm here to break people out of their trance.
[00:46:09.681 --> 00:46:11.542]  And that takes breaking myself out of a trance.
[00:46:13.222 --> 00:46:32.031]  I can't tell you how many wealthy, successful people I know who are fully aware of what's going on, but, you know, I'm going to go play golf, they say, or, you know, I'm going to go out and have some great dinner, or go out and see a great play, and I'm going to read some great literature, and I'm going to watch, you know, a show on Netflix or whatever, and Alex, you're not going to change it.
[00:46:32.873 --> 00:46:36.316]  It's that attitude that is going to let this all come into play.
[00:46:36.616 --> 00:46:38.037]  And those people aren't happy.
[00:46:38.357 --> 00:46:39.898]  They're just caught in a habit.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:45.803]  And they don't see it as their role to warn anybody or to get involved.
[00:46:47.624 --> 00:47:00.514]  Technology developed on primates to absolutely control them has and is being rolled out by successive incremental approximation.
[00:47:03.004 --> 00:47:04.006]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.547 --> 00:47:06.831]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.112 --> 00:47:14.966]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:06.061 --> 00:49:08.402]  Alright, welcome to the last segment of the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:49:08.962 --> 00:49:09.722]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[00:49:09.762 --> 00:49:18.285]  I had to jump in real quick and get into the seat because, let me tell you, this is probably the most important topic on health that I can think of.
[00:49:18.625 --> 00:49:31.270]  And around the country right now, we're seeing constantly a shutdown of fake cancer charities that are claiming to spend millions upon millions of dollars to find the cure, and people are just dying due to a lack of information.
[00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:42.073]  This has been a passion of mine for years and years, and I'm here with a good buddy of mine, and I think the premier researcher on what is actually going on with the whole so-called cancer industry.
[00:49:42.654 --> 00:49:49.316]  Somebody that's crawled through the National Library of Medicine more than anyone I know, more than any researcher I'm aware of, more than any doctor.
[00:49:49.736 --> 00:49:56.018]  He works with a lot of leading doctors and a lot of researchers, and that is Sayer G., who's the founder of GreenBedInfo.com.
[00:49:56.778 --> 00:50:11.946]  And I've used GreenmanInfo for years, and you know, we've talked for years as friends, but you have, what, like tens of thousands of studies just on cancer and other subjects on your website that you've crawled through, you've written the abstracts out for.
[00:50:12.486 --> 00:50:14.687]  You just know this in and out.
[00:50:14.907 --> 00:50:17.909]  And I want to get your take on this, and you have a lot to share in this interview.
[00:50:17.929 --> 00:50:19.690]  That's why I had to jump in on this last segment here.
[00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:21.251]  It's so important.
[00:50:22.032 --> 00:50:27.617]  First and foremost, I will say, I think there is a time and a place for pharmaceutical drugs.
[00:50:27.998 --> 00:50:29.619]  There is a time and a place for surgery.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.882]  If I'm in a car accident, I'm not going to go to a naturopathic doctor.
[00:50:33.323 --> 00:50:39.789]  If my arm is bleeding and shooting blood everywhere, I'm not going to call Dr. Group for some herbs.
[00:50:39.809 --> 00:50:43.273]  There is a time and a place for the so-called medical system.
[00:50:43.813 --> 00:50:51.038]  But, in my view, they're overarching, they're expanding away from, okay, here's a hospital for surgeries, for extreme care, right?
[00:50:51.538 --> 00:50:52.899]  Forget prevention now.
[00:50:53.199 --> 00:51:00.444]  Like, the big pharma companies can make so much money and just hide all the studies where they find it induces the negative behaviors they're attempting to treat, right?
[00:51:00.744 --> 00:51:05.787]  So, there is such an overarching, like, fat, bureaucratic, weird, big pharma thing going on.
[00:51:06.067 --> 00:51:06.187]  Yeah.
[00:51:06.428 --> 00:51:09.372]  And to me, the cancer industry is the leading cause of this.
[00:51:09.773 --> 00:51:14.400]  And with the cancer so-called charities being shut down, this is another indicator for me.
[00:51:14.981 --> 00:51:17.405]  What is your take on the cancer industry as it stands today?
[00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:21.573]  Well, unfortunately, what's happened is it's almost like an infection of the mind.
[00:51:21.693 --> 00:51:29.779]  You know, info warriors, I think, understand this very well, but you put into people's minds that there isn't a known cause for cancer, right?
[00:51:29.819 --> 00:51:33.142]  If you know a cause, identify it, remove it, you actually have a cure.
[00:51:33.602 --> 00:51:40.808]  Or you put into the mind this idea that prevention is early detection through mammography, where you're exposing pretty much healthy breasts
[00:51:41.348 --> 00:51:49.292]  To mammography x-rays that are actually inducing the very types of genetic damage in the breast tissue that cause breast cancer.
[00:51:49.893 --> 00:51:54.815]  And so what's happened is that there's this fear meme of people thinking, oh my god, we have to detect it early.
[00:51:54.956 --> 00:52:02.340]  And half the time, they're detecting lesions that have absolutely no malignancy, will never cause a symptom in the life of those individuals, or will cause harm.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:09.884]  And they call it cancer and say, we have to do preventive war, we have to go preemptive, we have to strike first, we have to use chemo, radiation, surgery.
[00:52:10.424 --> 00:52:15.106]  These are, you know, weapons of mass destruction grade treatments.
[00:52:15.246 --> 00:52:20.869]  You're using chemotherapy that the original use was, you know, it's derivative of mustard gas, basically.
[00:52:21.209 --> 00:52:29.993]  Or radioisotopes pulled from nuclear reactors and even munitions facilities to, quote, treat these essentially benign lesions.
[00:52:30.053 --> 00:52:36.456]  So what people need to understand is that when it comes to cancer treatment and prevention, we're all brainwashed.
[00:52:36.676 --> 00:52:51.986]  I mean, people don't understand the simple fact that our body is capable of the miracle of healing, even in the cases of cancer, which again, everyone thinks is an inexorably lethal process that's genetically based, not related to diet or all these exposures we're talking about.
[00:52:52.006 --> 00:52:55.589]  Because that would imply self-accountability.
[00:52:56.169 --> 00:52:58.310]  And responsibility to go out and change your lifestyle.
[00:52:58.330 --> 00:52:59.870]  And I don't have the most perfect lifestyle, right?
[00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:02.251]  I'm doing things that are carcinogenic in my daily life.
[00:53:02.911 --> 00:53:13.033]  And what's amazing to me, and tell me if you agree on this, you know a network of doctors and things, the MDs that I'm friends with, and the surgeons that I'm friends with, agree with all of this.
[00:53:13.614 --> 00:53:22.616]  And I actually have someone that runs a number of urgent care slash hospitals in Dallas, and he tells me, you wouldn't believe the ridiculous stuff that goes on.
[00:53:22.756 --> 00:53:31.199]  I mean, people going in, charging $100 for a saline bag that cost a cent, and so much money for all these procedures.
[00:53:31.219 --> 00:53:32.539]  Oh, these checkups and procedures.
[00:53:32.999 --> 00:53:34.240]  And it reminds me of your article.
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.081]  You were telling me it was one of the most shared last year.
[00:53:37.601 --> 00:53:40.682]  How many millions of people are misdiagnosed for cancer?
[00:53:40.922 --> 00:53:43.643]  I'm not going to put you on the spot for the exact number, but I mean it's millions, right?
[00:53:43.743 --> 00:53:51.227]  In the case of, quote, breast cancer, there's something called ductal carcinoma in situ and it's considered stage zero or early stage.
[00:53:51.447 --> 00:53:53.989]  1.3 million women in the U.S.
[00:53:54.149 --> 00:54:06.355]  in the past 30 years had their breasts either removed or exposed to radiation or chemo with lumpectomy for a condition that the National Cancer Institute two years ago identified as not being cancer at all.
[00:54:06.835 --> 00:54:19.413]  So literally all these Stockholm Syndrome type of situations have occurred where the women are now identifying with their aggressors, doing these prevention marches, cause marketing with pink ribbons, etc.
[00:54:19.533 --> 00:54:20.795]  And they think they're doing something great.
[00:54:21.135 --> 00:54:22.557]  So we're not attacking the people.
[00:54:23.078 --> 00:54:24.799]  I think that's amazing, right?
[00:54:25.159 --> 00:54:28.521]  They have good intentions, the people that are doing the pink rallies and stuff.
[00:54:28.561 --> 00:54:31.243]  It's not like they're like, yes, we're going to make money for Big Pharma.
[00:54:31.263 --> 00:54:33.044]  You know, these are good intentioned people.
[00:54:33.064 --> 00:54:33.824]  Right.
[00:54:34.064 --> 00:54:37.086]  Instead, we're saying it's sad how these people are being hijacked.
[00:54:37.206 --> 00:54:42.949]  All these fake cancer charities, how the cancer industry is kind of hijacking these people and pushing them towards something.
[00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:44.810]  And no one's talking about the prevention.
[00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:45.351]  Yeah.
[00:54:45.391 --> 00:54:46.531]  And the genetics are a factor.
[00:54:46.852 --> 00:54:47.272]  Absolutely.
[00:54:47.352 --> 00:54:48.733]  But no one's talking about the prevention.
[00:54:49.113 --> 00:54:51.474]  No one's talking about some of the science that you're highlighting.
[00:54:51.594 --> 00:54:51.814]  Right.
[00:54:51.894 --> 00:54:52.595]  It's really, really sad.
[00:54:52.935 --> 00:54:53.475]  Well, thank you.
[00:54:53.655 --> 00:55:02.939]  Because, of course, that's the last thing I want to project, is that those who are subject to the misunderstanding are somehow guilty of hurting themselves.
[00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:17.986]  When, in fact, Breast Cancer Awareness Month, if you look at the history of it, was actually a project of a pharmaceutical company, which AstraZeneca today represents, which has two blockbuster drugs for breast cancer, Aromadex and Tamoxifen.
[00:55:18.066 --> 00:55:21.448]  The same company that, by the way, if I'm remembering correctly, said
[00:55:22.108 --> 00:55:23.069]  Wow, it's amazing.
[00:55:23.249 --> 00:55:31.036]  Our top drug scientists found out recently that the microbiome and gut flora may play a role in the prevention of disease.
[00:55:31.096 --> 00:55:34.619]  And he goes, if you would have told me that five years ago, I would have laughed at you.
[00:55:34.959 --> 00:55:36.741]  We were saying that five years ago, right?
[00:55:36.821 --> 00:55:38.342]  So it's not like we're crazy people.
[00:55:38.883 --> 00:55:45.208]  We're looking at the research that's out there and saying, hey, maybe it's good to restore the biome, as they were saying three to five thousand years ago.
[00:55:45.268 --> 00:55:46.309]  You know, the center of all health.
[00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:47.951]  Hippocrates is saying it over and over again.
[00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:49.152]  But anyway, sorry, go ahead.
[00:55:49.372 --> 00:55:50.092]  No, it's beautiful.
[00:55:50.192 --> 00:55:55.735]  So basically today you have drugs that have been approved by the FDA for malignant melanoma.
[00:55:56.295 --> 00:55:59.117]  Literally costs $150 per milligram.
[00:55:59.177 --> 00:56:02.118]  That's 4,000 times the cost of gold by weight.
[00:56:02.758 --> 00:56:05.700]  And it hasn't even been placebo controlled validated.
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:16.945]  They compared it in the trial to some combination of an experimental vaccine and this drug and basically less people died who were just on the drug because the vaccine was causing all these harmful
[00:56:17.325 --> 00:56:19.666]  So they just compared it against an experimental product?
[00:56:19.806 --> 00:56:25.768]  Yeah, it was approved without the, you know, classical verification through, you know, placebo-controlled trials.
[00:56:27.149 --> 00:56:31.210]  So $150,000 of treatment, a course of treatment, and it extends life, if at all, two, three months.
[00:56:31.671 --> 00:56:34.992]  The point is, is that in my own research agreement info, we have literally
[00:56:36.172 --> 00:56:42.816]  3,000 studies we've indexed, over 700 natural compounds have been shown to kill cancer, including chemo and radiation resistant strains.
[00:56:43.236 --> 00:56:55.923]  I mean, these are preclinical, many of the studies, but the point is, is that when you can grow the cure for cancer in your backyard, or it's all about the food you're consuming, or even your mindset, you know, that's why this is such a threatening topic.
[00:56:56.363 --> 00:57:09.355]  You know, there's this amazing documentary, which I know InfoWars subscribers are able to get access to for free, TruthAboutCancer.com, which includes a lot of the people that have been on here, like Dr. Group, our friend, and it tells the truth about cancer.
[00:57:09.395 --> 00:57:17.041]  100 plus scientists and medical doctors, researchers tell the absolute truth about cancer, and it is the most empowering message you will ever hear.
[00:57:17.362 --> 00:57:17.642]  Right on.
[00:57:18.783 --> 00:57:22.186]  Well, maybe some of these things aren't a so-called cure for cancer, right?
[00:57:22.226 --> 00:57:27.410]  Like the research on ginger or turmeric or any of the awesome beneficial compounds out there.
[00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:30.612]  Maybe it's not like the cure, like you're going to take it and it's going to cure your cancer.
[00:57:30.892 --> 00:57:33.494]  But the studies say, hey, there's a reduction in cancer cells.
[00:57:33.895 --> 00:57:37.297]  Even marijuana constituents kill cancer cells.
[00:57:38.038 --> 00:57:39.499]  The federal journals have put that out.
[00:57:40.119 --> 00:57:48.266]  The sad thing is the drug companies or some group should then say, wow, we need to take this and expand upon this research and fund billions of dollars in this research.
[00:57:48.906 --> 00:57:57.169]  Not into a drug that costs $150,000 for a treatment that has only been tested against an experimental product, not versus placebo and not following the proper methodologies.
[00:57:57.669 --> 00:58:04.211]  Instead, maybe we should put the money towards natural things that people can take and prevent the cancer in the first place, but that's not profitable.
[00:58:04.511 --> 00:58:04.951]  No, thank you.
[00:58:04.971 --> 00:58:06.032]  That is the sad part.
[00:58:06.092 --> 00:58:06.333]  Yes.
[00:58:06.533 --> 00:58:22.466]  If you take a compound like turmeric that's been shown in hundreds of studies to kill hundreds of different types of cancer, and you alter it slightly, you know, produce a petrochemical derivative, it will then be able to be patented and give market exclusivity a return on investment.
[00:58:22.486 --> 00:58:25.729]  $11 billion is about how much it will cost for the FDA
[00:58:26.209 --> 00:58:26.689]  Thank you so much.
[00:59:03.849 --> 00:59:05.009]  Knockout is back.
[00:59:05.329 --> 00:59:16.432]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:59:16.852 --> 00:59:18.532]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:19.052 --> 00:59:28.174]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:28.554 --> 00:59:30.335]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:30.895 --> 00:59:31.755]  It's the same price
