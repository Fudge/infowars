[00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:22.324]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.384 --> 00:00:23.745]  I'm your host, Margaret Howell.
[00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:25.727]  It's Friday, December 30th.
[00:00:25.807 --> 00:00:27.128]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:38.637]  Tonight, Obama is pushing for World War III, while President-elect Trump is trying to avoid any confrontation.
[00:00:39.358 --> 00:00:46.144]  Meanwhile, Putin and Russia are laughing at the President's attempts to demonize Russia and blame them for Hillary's loss.
[00:00:47.364 --> 00:00:51.326]  Also, Obama continues to bring in refugees at a record pace.
[00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:54.107]  But where will they go, and who decides?
[00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.772]  And then, Bilderberg's website gets hacked, with a cryptic message left behind.
[00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:09.395]  And developing, seismic and volcanic activity across the world.
[00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:16.145]  All this and more on the final InfoWars Nightly News of 2016.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:05.961 --> 00:03:08.922]  Well, President Obama, he's had quite a day, hasn't he?
[00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:16.064]  He's decided to commit an ultimate provocation against Russia, sanctioning them, throwing 35 of their diplomats out of the country.
[00:03:16.104 --> 00:03:23.165]  We saw Dmitry Medvedev and his staff take to the Russian embassy in the UK, basically calling him a lame duck.
[00:03:23.205 --> 00:03:28.306]  It looks like Putin has responded himself, calling this, quote, kitchen diplomacy.
[00:03:28.326 --> 00:03:29.527]  I can't make this up.
[00:03:29.567 --> 00:03:30.487]  I found this on Vox.
[00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:38.953]  And it talks about how President Obama, he's taking these unprecedented steps to punish Russia for these cyber attacks we're seeing.
[00:03:38.973 --> 00:03:40.374]  Now, of course, U.S.
[00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:51.243]  intel agencies, they believe, and a couple of them, it's my belief that there are only a few rogue agents, this past year that Russia has mounted this attack on the integrity of the American electoral process.
[00:03:51.423 --> 00:03:52.524]  So what are we going to do?
[00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:59.009]  We're going to begin sanctioning and targeting like we've never targeted before, including throwing 35 of their people
[00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.571]  Out of the country!
[00:04:01.611 --> 00:04:11.421]  Now, of course, Putin has responded to this, and he's saying, look, just because you expel our people doesn't mean we're going to expel your people.
[00:04:11.481 --> 00:04:14.845]  He responds, he says, look, we're not expelling anyone from Russia.
[00:04:14.885 --> 00:04:16.186]  We're just going to hold tight here.
[00:04:16.206 --> 00:04:19.990]  And we refuse to sink to your kitchen diplomacy.
[00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.572]  Now, I had to ask, what was kitchen diplomacy?
[00:04:22.612 --> 00:04:23.974]  I hadn't heard that expression before.
[00:04:24.594 --> 00:04:32.780]  And Daria, one of our lovely, we-can't-do-without kind of people around here, explained to me that it's like a man and a wife bickering in the kitchen.
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.222]  So Russia's saying they're not going to stoop to that level.
[00:04:35.562 --> 00:04:37.443]  Thank God for that, that they're going to hold tight.
[00:04:37.884 --> 00:04:46.150]  We have an article that's up on our website written by Steve Watson, and it talks about how Trump and Reince Priebus is saying, we don't want World War anywhere.
[00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:54.334]  You know, Trump, he gave a statement from West Palm Beach about the Russian hacking and he said, look, who knows what really happened?
[00:04:54.374 --> 00:04:55.394]  We don't have any idea.
[00:04:55.434 --> 00:04:56.935]  They're not releasing any information.
[00:04:56.955 --> 00:04:59.796]  And in this computer age, there's a lot of really muffled things.
[00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:00.877]  But here's what we do know.
[00:05:01.277 --> 00:05:04.699]  We're not interested in going to war all over the place.
[00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:05.599]  That's what we do know.
[00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:08.561]  And of course, he addresses the fact that Obama
[00:05:09.381 --> 00:05:09.461]  It's
[00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:31.550]  They'd agreed to build for Russia.
[00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:44.661]  We were pressuring the West, the UK specifically, to make sure that Russian diplomats and people in the Russian government, their kids were kicked out of private schools, and we made a lot of them persona non grata because of the Ukraine and Crimea.
[00:05:45.842 --> 00:05:56.411]  But this, we have no evidence of any hacking, and yet our president, he has to look strong and tough in these last final hours instead of playing golf, which is my opinion.
[00:05:56.431 --> 00:05:58.272]  That's where he belongs, frankly, on the golf course.
[00:05:59.113 --> 00:06:02.455]  Not kicking Russia in the teeth on the way out.
[00:06:02.515 --> 00:06:18.423]  Now, we know that President Obama, the unprecedented amount of red tape that he's throwing up there right before Trump gets in, this article surprisingly comes from The Hill, and that's sort of an internal beltway kind of paper for all the wonks on Capitol Hill to read.
[00:06:18.443 --> 00:06:26.227]  I found this article particularly amusing, and it talks about how President Obama is taking a number of unilateral
[00:06:26.527 --> 00:06:34.852]  He's doing actions in his last 10 years, last days of tenure to appear, that appear to be boxing in President-elect Donald Trump.
[00:06:34.932 --> 00:06:39.735]  Now, all of this red tape, of course, we discussed the sanctions of Russian entities.
[00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:44.758]  We've also discussed this permanent ban on oil and gas drilling.
[00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:46.960]  He's doing a lot of these actions.
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.542]  Some of them are costing billions of dollars by the time they're all finished.
[00:06:52.703 --> 00:06:52.904]  Yeah.
[00:07:07.602 --> 00:07:09.724]  That there's so many regulations to undo.
[00:07:10.285 --> 00:07:15.009]  And I was listening to the business aspect, the business regulations in particular.
[00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:18.312]  Carl Icahn, you know, there's been a lot of crap thrown at Carl Icahn.
[00:07:18.352 --> 00:07:19.253]  He's not the right choice.
[00:07:19.293 --> 00:07:19.994]  He is the right choice.
[00:07:20.294 --> 00:07:20.754]  You know what?
[00:07:20.954 --> 00:07:28.642]  I'm of the belief that he is the man for the job to do this because we need somebody who understands what these regulations do to businesses and can undo them.
[00:07:29.342 --> 00:07:37.210]  As somebody who comes from two parents with small businesses myself, I understand the burden and the implication of these ridiculous regulations on our American system.
[00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.074]  What they're doing to the small business owner in this country, they're tying up hands.
[00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:42.095]  And you know what?
[00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:52.405]  We heard President Trump, and I don't mean to get off topic here, but it's very important to me as a citizen living in this country who hates paying a federal tax every year because I don't have adequate health insurance.
[00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:55.286]  This Obamacare crap, 8,000 pages in length.
[00:07:55.626 --> 00:07:58.607]  Most people didn't even read it before they signed it up on the Hill.
[00:07:58.928 --> 00:08:01.409]  And of course, we heard Nancy Pelosi say, you know what?
[00:08:01.849 --> 00:08:03.870]  You gotta pass it before you know what's in it.
[00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.510]  Well, now we know what's in it, folks.
[00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:12.013]  And thank God that Trump is on the way to dismantling Obamacare, as he promised he would do.
[00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.414]  And I have some faith in that promise.
[00:08:14.454 --> 00:08:18.816]  Now, we've seen a mass wave of populism all across the globe.
[00:08:19.876 --> 00:08:24.761]  We saw it in Italy with Pepe Grillo leading the referendum to tear down the current Prime Minister.
[00:08:24.801 --> 00:08:36.431]  We've seen it in France with Marine Le Pen coming to the National Front, if you will, that's the name of her party, and she literally is coming to the National Front as people are gaining momentum against these globalist rogue policies.
[00:08:36.451 --> 00:08:40.714]  We've seen it here in the States with Trump and of course with Brexit and Nigel Farage.
[00:08:40.775 --> 00:08:44.478]  Now, it looks like some of the Italian thugs that
[00:08:44.798 --> 00:08:45.038]  Can you
[00:09:04.338 --> 00:09:09.803]  They want to make sure that public agencies are working to remove the fake news from anything.
[00:09:09.843 --> 00:09:12.124]  We're seeing these fines imposed in Italy as well.
[00:09:12.164 --> 00:09:14.306]  We saw it in Germany.
[00:09:14.366 --> 00:09:23.373]  Merkel talking to Zuckerberg herself and making sure that Facebook knows that for every fake news post left up every day, it's going to be 500,000 euros.
[00:09:23.714 --> 00:09:28.457]  Looks like Italy, because of the referendum, some of the people in power, they cannot stand it either.
[00:09:29.258 --> 00:09:30.219]  And what are they doing?
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.981]  They're trying to say, you know what?
[00:09:32.241 --> 00:09:33.423]  We're just going to fine you.
[00:09:33.763 --> 00:09:34.824]  And I've got news for you.
[00:09:35.184 --> 00:09:38.488]  We're in the process of sort of developing the Beginner's Guide to Fake News.
[00:09:38.528 --> 00:09:41.351]  And we were talking about this a couple of nights ago.
[00:09:41.691 --> 00:09:44.054]  We really want people to understand what real fake news is.
[00:09:44.474 --> 00:09:48.759]  It is the garbage being spouted, the warmongering happening on television.
[00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:53.622]  Right now all you have to do is turn on your TV set and you're going to get an earload full of fake news.
[00:09:53.762 --> 00:09:54.582]  I can promise you.
[00:09:55.023 --> 00:09:59.065]  And it's garbage talking about how we should basically go to war with Russia.
[00:09:59.185 --> 00:10:00.766]  I've been hearing that all morning long.
[00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:02.727]  Baseless accusations.
[00:10:02.807 --> 00:10:06.790]  Meanwhile, the Russians and the Turkish, Erdogan and Putin,
[00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:07.570]  I don't
[00:10:29.841 --> 00:10:48.334]  Speaking of fake news, and I go to the New York Times mainly for laughs, there are a couple of good reporters at the New York Times that I know personally and have interviewed before, but the majority of them have no problem basically being lapdogs for the liberal establishment, the Obama administration.
[00:10:48.975 --> 00:10:54.719]  And this specific piece, I couldn't pass it up, I had to bring it to you because there's been a lot of trolling going on.
[00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:57.439]  from the New York Times, this nuclear option.
[00:10:57.479 --> 00:11:01.480]  The New York Times is trolling Christians on the Christian holiday.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.521]  Now, we would never see this in reverse, and I don't care what you are.
[00:11:05.541 --> 00:11:09.541]  I don't care if you're a Muslim, an atheist, a person of Jewish descent, or a Christian.
[00:11:10.022 --> 00:11:19.883]  I myself find this very appalling that they are picking and being very prejudicial, excuse me, in the way that they're writing.
[00:11:20.583 --> 00:11:23.944]  And this one particular piece, if you can only imagine,
[00:11:24.804 --> 00:11:33.951]  If Muslims had to face the same type of trolling from the New York Times as they celebrate on one of their holiest days, we might see a few attacks in this country.
[00:11:34.012 --> 00:11:45.140]  But because they're picking a group that largely gets persecuted, but it goes unnoticed because, you know what, hey, it's the Christian population, they see that as fair game and fair fodder.
[00:11:45.261 --> 00:11:50.165]  Now, speaking of Christians, they're not the only ones persecuted in this country, as we know.
[00:11:50.785 --> 00:11:51.225]  I think so.
[00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:12.651]  D.C.
[00:12:12.711 --> 00:12:15.433]  law enforcement, and this was up on the Daily Caller, D.C.
[00:12:15.473 --> 00:12:21.639]  law enforcement, they're demanding the removal of a Capitol painting depicting cops as racist pigs.
[00:12:21.739 --> 00:12:31.247]  Now, on this piece, you know, this congressional art competition exhibit, it literally shows police officers as pigs.
[00:12:33.129 --> 00:12:33.750]  In the face.
[00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.452]  And they're killing innocent people.
[00:12:36.472 --> 00:12:44.078]  I want to just quote this directly from this Democratic Missouri representative named Lacey Clay in a statement.
[00:12:45.179 --> 00:12:51.384]  Representative Clay says, the painting portrays a colorful landscape of symbolic characters representing social injustice.
[00:12:52.185 --> 00:12:52.866]  No, it doesn't.
[00:12:53.026 --> 00:12:56.989]  It portrays law enforcement as pigs, not human.
[00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:58.290]  That is appalling.
[00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.292]  It should be removed immediately.
[00:13:00.312 --> 00:13:01.393]  This is utter
[00:13:01.673 --> 00:13:02.213]  We're good.
[00:13:21.738 --> 00:13:42.527]  We honestly we spout the truth as best as we can here and he takes a lot of heat because of his rogue globalist agenda and I am no exception in that as a reporter I find I find what he's doing in this country particularly repugnant in a lot of ways and Leanne talked about this on the radio show today and I just wanted to bring it up again
[00:13:42.967 --> 00:13:44.088]  Because it is so important.
[00:13:44.108 --> 00:13:47.592]  We're seeing the President in his last 20-something days of office.
[00:13:47.852 --> 00:13:54.099]  He is ramming through as many refugees, unvetted in some cases I might add, as many as he can.
[00:13:54.119 --> 00:14:02.388]  And we have these states, Nebraska is one of these states, and the resettlement program, because Nebraska has a lot of land and not a lot of populace.
[00:14:02.608 --> 00:14:03.969]  And the President is on to that.
[00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:25.436]  Dropping 502 additional refugees into Nebraska during, and we're already into FY 2017, it began in October, that's how the federal government does it, and significantly higher in Nebraska than it's been during any other part of the year in more than three decades since the state has participated in the Federal Refugee Resettlement Program.
[00:14:25.476 --> 00:14:29.377]  So he is ratcheting it up, folks, as many as he can.
[00:14:30.077 --> 00:14:30.738]  I think so.
[00:14:50.839 --> 00:15:01.748]  Who were allowing into our nation unvetted coming from places where Islamic radical radicalism and Islamic terrorism is growing rapidly on the ground.
[00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:06.771]  You know we had a hand in destabilizing Syria and I really I have a heavy heart when it comes to that.
[00:15:07.552 --> 00:15:11.314]  Because we never, we had no business what the hell we were doing there.
[00:15:11.394 --> 00:15:29.201]  We wanted to destabilize the population but now that we had a hand in that, namely arming rebels on the ground, we've seen this collapse and we're forced to take in a disenfranchised population and it's much to our demise, let me just say that.
[00:15:29.281 --> 00:15:34.784]  So going back to Trump for a minute and those policies and moving on really quickly, we're running out of time.
[00:15:35.504 --> 00:15:40.647]  A story also coming up in the Hill, and I don't know if you guys have watched Chuck Todd at all.
[00:15:41.427 --> 00:15:43.728]  He's like the everyman, if you will.
[00:15:43.748 --> 00:15:52.953]  He looks unassuming, not an attractive man, not a well-spoken man, so he gets away with a lot because he flies under the radar, in my opinion.
[00:15:53.793 --> 00:16:02.458]  He actually weighed in on President Trump, and the ego on this guy, this article he said, I've interviewed Trump multiple times on Meet the Press,
[00:16:03.078 --> 00:16:08.040]  And the amount of times he spends after the interview watching the interview with a sound off.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.221]  He wants people to know that Trump is watching himself.
[00:16:10.301 --> 00:16:11.822]  He's trying to shame Trump.
[00:16:13.082 --> 00:16:14.883]  He will watch the whole thing on mute.
[00:16:15.483 --> 00:16:16.544]  He thinks this way.
[00:16:16.644 --> 00:16:19.825]  And look, it's important insight into just understanding him.
[00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:24.267]  He's trying to shed some light on Trump's character by saying that he watches himself with a sound off.
[00:16:25.327 --> 00:16:29.349]  Buddy, who gives a flying piece of crap if he watches himself with a sound off?
[00:16:29.429 --> 00:16:35.131]  I'm sure you have spent countless decades watching yourself with a sound on and off.
[00:16:35.191 --> 00:16:45.796]  And sometimes, and I know this is a reporter, and I have one of those voices, I know it sounds like a girl, I got a girl's voice and it's hard to really, sometimes you watch yourself with a sound off.
[00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:46.636]  I don't know.
[00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:03.344]  I think?
[00:17:19.479 --> 00:17:24.702]  And talking about Obama and how he's permanently banned, you know, he's doing these bans and these resolutions.
[00:17:25.362 --> 00:17:31.365]  He's also talking in depth, he's allowing the UN Security Council to condemn Israel.
[00:17:31.405 --> 00:17:39.809]  So even though John Kerry is saying we had nothing to do with it, we weren't behind it, he's still allowing the United Nations to go after Israel and to slap them.
[00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:54.494]  And I'm of the belief that we have no business in ordering Israel around at all, regardless of how you feel about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, regardless of how you feel about the measures that they're taking or whose land belongs to whom.
[00:17:54.934 --> 00:18:03.857]  We have no business condemning them and letting the international body do so while we stand behind it and pretend like we're not standing behind it.
[00:18:04.637 --> 00:18:12.623]  Speaking of Israel, because I'm also of the belief that our President Obama, he is propping up the Imams of Iran and he's condemning Israel.
[00:18:12.763 --> 00:18:14.364]  And that's a very dangerous thing.
[00:18:14.384 --> 00:18:18.868]  I want to leave you guys with this, this tally of Iran sanctions relief.
[00:18:19.028 --> 00:18:20.669]  If you remember, he lifted the sanctions.
[00:18:21.189 --> 00:18:24.272]  It includes more than 10 billion in cash and gold.
[00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:24.812]  That's right.
[00:18:24.872 --> 00:18:29.595]  Large shipments tied to nuclear negotiations to make it harder to track what Tehran does with its money.
[00:18:30.396 --> 00:18:39.191]  But this, in fact, is the case that because of Washington, because of this president, Iran sanctions lifted $10 billion in cash and gold.
[00:18:39.211 --> 00:18:40.053]  Hey, guess what?
[00:18:40.173 --> 00:18:44.039]  We still don't have a check and balance on what they're doing with their nuclear program.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:16.387]  Three years ago, the Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act repealed the law that had been on the books for decades, barring the CIA and other agencies from engaging in domestic propaganda and disinformation.
[00:19:17.734 --> 00:19:36.358]  Over the weekend, they passed the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act that funds 160 plus million dollars to this new organization that will, quote, discover and counter with its own disinformation, alternative media that they dub fake news.
[00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:52.010]  At the very same time, we see mainstream media claiming that Trump, myself, Tucker Carlson, you name it, are Russian agents, and that the American people really wanted Hillary Clinton, but the Russians somehow hacked in, and that's why Trump won.
[00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:56.173]  Yes, we've gotten Trump elected, but they're openly trying to overthrow that.
[00:19:57.034 --> 00:20:00.379]  Now more than ever, InfoWars needs your prayers and your support.
[00:20:00.439 --> 00:20:06.106]  And I need you to take the articles and the videos that are on the site and realize you're the reason we're having such an effect.
[00:20:06.166 --> 00:20:07.948]  You're the power of InfoWars.

[00:20:13.869 --> 00:20:22.471]  As we approach Christmas, and I'm supposed to say that word now, our country's under such incredible thought police tyranny, it's important to be thankful.
[00:20:22.612 --> 00:20:34.215]  And I am extremely thankful to all of you that have prayed for us, that have spread the word about the broadcast, that have supported us, that have defended us, and that have financially supported us.

[00:23:06.913 --> 00:23:13.136]  For us, you are an example of a true American man, the true American spirit.
[00:23:13.717 --> 00:23:20.681]  You, Alex, have changed our view of who a real American is.
[00:23:22.121 --> 00:23:32.047]  If the American people are anything like you, then the attitude toward your country, toward your people, will be radically changed.
[00:23:44.453 --> 00:23:50.494]  We have a special program today because in a few moments we are joined by a legendary American journalist Alex Jones.
[00:23:51.715 --> 00:23:56.636]  But before that, let's see this short piece about our today's special guest Alex Jones.
[00:23:58.143 --> 00:24:01.745]  Mainstream media, the fourthest state, is molding us today.
[00:24:02.065 --> 00:24:08.169]  We form our worldview, our perception of reality, depending on how the mainstream media presents the information to us.
[00:24:08.729 --> 00:24:13.972]  In the Western world, the dictatorship of the liberal paradigm is all too obvious when it comes to the media.
[00:24:14.212 --> 00:24:16.595]  But it's become especially brazen during the U.S.
[00:24:16.675 --> 00:24:17.577]  presidential race.
[00:24:17.957 --> 00:24:22.724]  All the big media moguls openly supported the war criminal Hillary Clinton.
[00:24:23.024 --> 00:24:31.336]  Round the clock, with the help of lies, distortions, and fake polls, they praised her political platform and assured of her inevitable win.
[00:24:31.556 --> 00:24:39.700]  Meanwhile, all the front pages of every other publication portray Trump as a loser, intentionally exaggerating his supposed dark past.
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:44.663]  His words taken out of context and repeated over and over on all media outlets.
[00:24:44.943 --> 00:24:54.588]  On November 8, the main Western media operations had already prepared their November 9 issue with Hillary's portrait on the cover and headline, Madam President.
[00:24:54.828 --> 00:25:01.051]  And television programs have prepared reports praising the Lady Kingpin of the world financial elites.
[00:25:01.591 --> 00:25:07.138]  Something went wrong and all the pre-scripted news packages turned a complete fiasco.
[00:25:07.238 --> 00:25:09.902]  They've put everything on the line and failed miserably.
[00:25:10.022 --> 00:25:13.426]  The predetermined Clinton win has suffered a death blow.
[00:25:13.586 --> 00:25:14.988]  The numbers spoke for themselves.
[00:25:15.148 --> 00:25:15.969]  Trump won.
[00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:19.854]  No one in the US mainstream media believed or wanted to believe in Trump.
[00:25:20.094 --> 00:25:32.683]  No one except for those in the scientific polls, Los Angeles Times, and one dynamic, highly passionate, energetic and unrelenting journalist and documentary producer Alex Jones, the director and editor-in-chief of InfoWars News.
[00:25:32.903 --> 00:25:37.246]  It is this journalist who had the courage to show the truth of what is really going on in the United States.
[00:25:37.486 --> 00:25:41.869]  For many years he has been fighting the false narratives of the mainstream media information.
[00:25:42.069 --> 00:25:49.174]  He has exposed the globalist liberal ideology prevailing in a totalitarian style on the modern Western media front.
[00:25:49.494 --> 00:25:54.678]  He reported on the financial elites, their stakes and strategies during the election.
[00:25:55.038 --> 00:26:03.964]  Alex Jones believes that behind all the world's media outlets there is an ideological liberal agenda which aims at building a unipolar empire.
[00:26:04.204 --> 00:26:09.548]  This world government manipulates all the prominent media systems for the sake of their own personal interests.
[00:26:10.148 --> 00:26:15.232]  He was all but ostracized for continually exposing the war crimes of Hillary Clinton.
[00:26:15.433 --> 00:26:20.537]  They avoided mentioning his name, and his website suffered repeated denial-of-service attacks.
[00:26:20.777 --> 00:26:22.719]  But they couldn't stop him.
[00:26:22.939 --> 00:26:26.242]  His videos continue to gather hundreds of thousands of views.
[00:26:26.562 --> 00:26:33.086]  Infowars.com was practically the only resource where the elections were covered thoroughly and objectively.
[00:26:33.246 --> 00:26:39.529]  They didn't cut their live feeds when someone voiced criticism toward the FBI, and they discussed the Wikileaks dumps.
[00:26:39.769 --> 00:26:44.092]  Infowars has built itself to serve the interests of the American people.
[00:26:44.292 --> 00:26:48.974]  This media organization showed its independence from the world financial elites.
[00:26:49.234 --> 00:26:51.916]  It showed its sovereignty from the globalist owners.
[00:26:52.216 --> 00:27:08.852]  And today, when all the mainstream liberal media have utterly been discredited, revealing themselves as puppets, InfoWars along with the new independent media outlets are becoming powerful forces in the new era and new paradigm which ushered Donald Trump.
[00:27:10.093 --> 00:27:13.976]  I'm very happy that Alex Jones is live with us right now.
[00:27:14.697 --> 00:27:25.726]  We have been following you, Alex, for many years, including myself personally, and when you became truly celebrated in this new era of Donald Trump, I marveled at you.
[00:27:26.207 --> 00:27:32.772]  The fact that such people as yourself, who embody such free and independent points of view,
[00:27:33.473 --> 00:27:34.254]  We're good to go.
[00:27:53.095 --> 00:28:06.781]  And all the dirt that they were throwing your way, and whether it be Russians, Europeans, Asians or Turks, for us, you are an example of a true American man, the true American spirit.
[00:28:07.341 --> 00:28:12.524]  You, Alex, have changed our view of who a real American is.
[00:28:15.765 --> 00:28:25.693]  If the American people are anything like you, then the attitude toward your country, toward your people, will be radically changed.
[00:28:27.134 --> 00:28:33.960]  And when Donald Trump won, whom you supported, and whom we were all also in solidarity with,
[00:28:35.921 --> 00:28:41.004]  When you and him and all of us won, I said this.
[00:28:41.024 --> 00:28:43.786]  Anti-Americanism is over.
[00:28:43.806 --> 00:28:46.267]  Now the people of the free United States, free Russia,
[00:28:53.972 --> 00:29:00.596]  And all the anti-globalist powers worldwide have to build a new world, new architecture.
[00:29:01.217 --> 00:29:05.780]  We are exceedingly glad to see you on our program, broadcasting live, right now.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:12.124]  And from the bottom of our hearts, we thank you for being the genuine face of real America.
[00:29:23.411 --> 00:29:27.013]  And your colleagues at InfoWars, including your presence on social media.
[00:29:27.934 --> 00:29:34.778]  And of course, lately, especially, InfoWars has been under attacks and pressure coming from the swamp of the mainstream media.
[00:29:37.279 --> 00:29:40.481]  But after Clinton lost, they weren't able to accept it.
[00:29:41.681 --> 00:29:45.283]  It seems they don't have the strength of mind to recognize their defeat.
[00:29:46.684 --> 00:29:54.728]  And of course they have to attack the ones who played such an important role in this victory, which is you and your colleagues in the independent American patriot media.
[00:29:55.868 --> 00:29:59.890]  Today we find ourselves together in the same situation.
[00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:03.392]  See, when you speak of the civil war that is happening in America,
[00:30:04.352 --> 00:30:06.254]  The same civil war is happening in Europe.
[00:30:06.334 --> 00:30:12.561]  And in this same civil war, which was started 16 years ago in our country, the forces of good have also been victorious.
[00:30:23.013 --> 00:30:31.761]  That's why we understand that today we are all in the same situation, whether it be Russians, Americans or Europeans.
[00:30:32.122 --> 00:30:35.325]  The globalists do not represent America.
[00:30:35.585 --> 00:30:38.247]  They are the enemy of the American people.
[00:30:38.468 --> 00:30:39.689]  And when you tell people
[00:30:40.976 --> 00:31:06.311]  Addressing your supporters, it sounds like a call to all the people worldwide to shake off the dominance of the globalist elites and establish in each of our countries our own American order in America, Russian order in Russia, Turkish order in Turkey, and this war and struggle is what unites us.
[00:31:07.071 --> 00:31:18.835]  Prior to a certain point, the global corporations, transnational corporations, the globalist elites were presented to us as the voice of the United States.
[00:31:20.715 --> 00:31:34.400]  But thanks to Trump's victory, we now know that there is a distinct difference between the American people, that's you, that's those who are the resistance to the globalist dictatorship, and the political elites.
[00:31:35.461 --> 00:31:39.903]  Which organized color revolutions against us.
[00:31:40.123 --> 00:31:46.687]  And they, the Soroses, the Clintons, the Obama administration, the so-called Deep State.
[00:31:47.067 --> 00:31:55.411]  They also organized color revolutions against Trump, refusing to recognize the democratic victory of the American people.
[00:31:55.791 --> 00:32:01.194]  And all of us, united, have to think about how we can resist this elite.
[00:32:01.814 --> 00:32:02.995]  We, the people.
[00:32:03.815 --> 00:32:14.361]  Each defending our own system of values have to engage in dialogue in terms of what do we want to build instead of globalism.
[00:32:15.802 --> 00:32:25.028]  And this time to build it not in opposition to America, not in opposition to Russia, not in opposition to Turkey.
[00:32:26.409 --> 00:32:37.518]  Not so that we fight each other to protect our narrow national interests, which is what the globalists impose on us, to fight with each other, a civil war.
[00:32:38.199 --> 00:32:39.740]  We have to avoid this.
[00:32:40.661 --> 00:32:50.269]  And that's why the communication and dialogue between us, exchange of ideas and different views, is so important.
[00:33:02.486 --> 00:33:07.268]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[00:33:07.428 --> 00:33:14.471]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[00:33:14.731 --> 00:33:23.215]  I started to exercise really hard again, and I started to try to eat healthy, started taking third-party supplements, started seeing some more gains.
[00:33:23.795 --> 00:33:24.015]  I think?
[00:33:42.092 --> 00:33:45.435]  I was in the best shape of my life since I'd been in really good shape in my 20s.
[00:33:45.455 --> 00:33:46.536]  But the election heated up.
[00:33:46.576 --> 00:33:48.959]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[00:33:49.079 --> 00:33:58.348]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[00:33:58.548 --> 00:33:59.509]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[00:33:59.689 --> 00:34:03.372]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put Lazy Susan back on the table.
[00:34:04.173 --> 00:34:06.295]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again.
[00:34:07.015 --> 00:34:10.238]  And I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[00:34:10.278 --> 00:34:11.579]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:15.281]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[00:34:15.482 --> 00:34:16.402]  It's December 5th, 2016.
[00:34:16.522 --> 00:34:20.105]  We're only like 25 days from 2017.
[00:34:20.485 --> 00:34:30.553]  And I want to invite all of the info workers of every race, color, and creed that bleed red blood and love liberty, justice, and truth to make our bodies great again.
[00:34:33.564 --> 00:34:38.587]  One of the most common questions I get is, you've changed the whole radio TV model.
[00:34:39.348 --> 00:34:40.088]  How did you do it?
[00:34:40.148 --> 00:34:43.030]  Did an ad agency teach you that or what book did you read?
[00:34:43.351 --> 00:34:44.912]  And the answer is, it was trial and error.
[00:34:45.172 --> 00:34:50.475]  I promote products that I personally use, like the Nutraceuticals and Infowarslife.com.
[00:34:50.956 --> 00:34:52.777]  And it's the same thing for this promotion.
[00:34:53.277 --> 00:34:54.598]  I didn't get this from an ad agency.
[00:34:54.658 --> 00:34:55.859]  I didn't just think this up.
[00:34:56.339 --> 00:35:03.184]  I was sitting there, I'd gained probably 10, 15 pounds because I've gotten out of the habit of taking the supplements in the last few months with the election.
[00:35:03.964 --> 00:35:14.030]  And I was thinking, wow, I need to religiously take these, because I'm promoting these things, it's making me healthier, and if I'm not taking them, you know, I'm fatter, plus people aren't going to buy the product.
[00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:17.672]  So that's where the promotion comes from, is purely from reality.
[00:35:18.012 --> 00:35:24.816]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table, I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[00:35:24.856 --> 00:35:31.640]  I've lost five pounds religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:32.561]  It's amazing.
[00:35:32.861 --> 00:35:35.245]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[00:35:35.505 --> 00:35:38.229]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:35:38.429 --> 00:35:40.992]  And to be clear, I'm exercising the same amount.
[00:35:41.693 --> 00:35:45.599]  It's the holidays, so I'm eating pumpkin pie, pecan pie.
[00:35:45.799 --> 00:35:47.000]  I ate a candy bar last night.
[00:35:48.456 --> 00:35:51.598]  I mean, quite frankly, I eat more junk during the holidays like everybody else.
[00:35:52.018 --> 00:35:53.299]  So I'm eating worse.
[00:35:53.919 --> 00:36:01.283]  But because I've got these trace elements, or whatever it's doing in DNA Force and X2 and Supermail, I have lost 5 pounds.
[00:36:01.443 --> 00:36:01.983]  It's incredible.
[00:36:02.984 --> 00:36:04.905]  I thought I might lose 10 to 15 in a month.
[00:36:05.145 --> 00:36:06.406]  If this continues, it'll be 20.
[00:36:06.506 --> 00:36:08.927]  But generally, it's more dramatic up front.
[00:36:09.527 --> 00:36:10.408]  This is an experiment.
[00:36:10.528 --> 00:36:11.268]  Everybody's watching.
[00:36:11.529 --> 00:36:12.349]  We'll see what happens.
[00:36:12.789 --> 00:36:13.930]  This is Part 2.
[00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:15.571]  Next week, Part 3.
[00:36:16.451 --> 00:36:17.052]  That's a good point.
[00:36:17.892 --> 00:36:26.998]  We just cut there and Rob Deuce said, hey Alex, I know you don't follow script, but you might want to add to people, we're running some of the biggest specials of the year until December 17th.
[00:36:27.279 --> 00:36:33.003]  That's the last day that you can get your order in and have guaranteed shipping anywhere in the United States.
[00:36:33.183 --> 00:36:34.924]  And we have some of the biggest specials of the year.
[00:36:34.944 --> 00:36:37.486]  50% off many of the nutraceuticals.
[00:36:37.806 --> 00:36:38.667]  The lowest discount is 25%.
[00:36:38.707 --> 00:36:38.847]  30% off X2.
[00:36:41.889 --> 00:36:46.991]  Huge discounts and free shipping store wide on every product, thousands of items.
[00:36:47.412 --> 00:36:51.794]  And on top of that, if you sign up for auto ship, an additional 10% off.
[00:36:51.834 --> 00:36:56.776]  And I'm going to do one more bad thing because I'm politically correct, or I guess I'm politically incorrect.
[00:36:57.236 --> 00:36:59.257]  And that's a Merry Christmas to everybody.
[00:36:59.597 --> 00:37:00.758]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:37:00.838 --> 00:37:01.378]  You're awesome.
[00:37:05.339 --> 00:37:07.520]  Well, now your time is up, Obama.
[00:37:07.841 --> 00:37:10.202]  Remember all those promises you made?
[00:37:10.623 --> 00:37:14.825]  When I said, change we can believe in, I didn't say change we can believe in tomorrow.
[00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:22.410]  Back during the hoopla of Obama hysteria, Washington Monthly listed Obama's top 50 achievements.
[00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:28.174]  Here are a few of those supposed achievements which have actually been proven to be hollow shams.
[00:37:28.434 --> 00:37:30.215]  Past health care reform.
[00:37:30.416 --> 00:37:31.856]  Past the stimulus.
[00:37:32.217 --> 00:37:33.898]  Past Wall Street reform.
[00:37:34.318 --> 00:37:35.819]  Ended the war in Iraq.
[00:37:36.039 --> 00:37:38.640]  Began drawdown of the war in Afghanistan.
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.021]  Eliminated Osama Bin Laden.
[00:37:41.302 --> 00:37:45.644]  And now the cold reality behind Obama's legacy of globalism.
[00:37:45.844 --> 00:37:52.427]  Obama prosecuted more federal whistleblowers as spies under the Espionage Act than all previous U.S.
[00:37:52.527 --> 00:37:53.848]  presidents combined.
[00:37:54.168 --> 00:38:00.531]  Obama's Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform added no new discretionary authority to fuel Wall Street.
[00:38:00.671 --> 00:38:03.813]  International bankers were responsible for the mandates.
[00:38:04.193 --> 00:38:11.438]  Airstrikes and operations continue in Iraq and 10,000 US troops still remain in Afghanistan.
[00:38:11.779 --> 00:38:14.421]  Obama didn't kill Osama Bin Laden.
[00:38:14.661 --> 00:38:18.524]  Osama Bin Laden died when we went into Afghanistan.
[00:38:18.724 --> 00:38:21.626]  General Tommy Franks had stated very clearly
[00:38:22.355 --> 00:38:23.116]  I think so.
[00:38:36.385 --> 00:38:42.848]  According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Obama was responsible for 528 strikes that killed 4,189 persons, an estimated 474 of whom were civilians.
[00:38:42.868 --> 00:38:44.228]  Obama signed record regulations
[00:38:53.292 --> 00:38:55.713]  527 pages in one day.
[00:38:56.054 --> 00:39:10.860]  The Washington Examiner reports, while Congress passed just 211 laws, Obama's team issued and accompanying 3,852 new federal regulations, some costing billions of dollars.
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:19.684]  Obama's health care reform, Obamacare, an unconstitutional religious freedom violating tax on a mandated health care,
[00:39:19.864 --> 00:39:20.885]  We're good to go.
[00:39:34.224 --> 00:39:43.868]  Ended terror asylum restrictions while allowing the highest number of Muslim refugees since data on religious affiliations was collected.
[00:39:44.168 --> 00:39:47.889]  Killed four Americans overseas with no due process.
[00:39:48.209 --> 00:39:52.431]  Ordered SWAT teams to raid Gibson Guitar Factory and seize property.
[00:39:52.811 --> 00:39:55.272]  After the debacle, no charges were filed.
[00:39:55.672 --> 00:39:57.533]  Do you think there's something political going on here?
[00:39:58.487 --> 00:40:13.056]  Well, the fact that we're doing the same thing other people are doing and only we are being targeted leads me to believe that there are some ulterior, possibly political motives.
[00:40:13.616 --> 00:40:16.458]  Use the IRS to target conservative groups.
[00:40:16.758 --> 00:40:23.682]  Work to allow a FISA court to reverse restrictions on the NSA's interception of citizens' emails and phone calls.
[00:40:24.062 --> 00:40:29.944]  Sold thousands of guns to criminals under Fast and Furious and then ignored a congressional subpoena.
[00:40:30.124 --> 00:40:35.286]  Traded five Guantanamo inmates for Bo Bergdahl, who would later be viewed as a traitor.
[00:40:35.586 --> 00:40:42.409]  Fueled racial tensions, pushing a race war and creating an environment for innocent police officers to be killed.
[00:40:42.729 --> 00:40:44.449]  Supported the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:40:44.569 --> 00:40:48.711]  Obama supports the Saudi Arabian government, who continued
[00:40:48.931 --> 00:40:49.331]  We're good to go.
[00:41:17.765 --> 00:41:26.409]  Obama said he would never sign the 2013 NDAA allowing the executive office to jail any American citizen without due process.
[00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:32.653]  Instead he signed the 2013 NDAA overnight while Americans celebrated New Year's Eve.
[00:41:33.553 --> 00:41:39.478]  As hard as we can to make sure that this is a successful transition for the President-elect.
[00:41:39.878 --> 00:41:44.181]  Obama has single-handedly begun a new Cold War with Russia.
[00:41:44.381 --> 00:41:50.586]  And that's a short list as we head towards the final 20 days of Obama's reign of tyranny.
[00:41:50.886 --> 00:42:00.253]  Any American denying these tyrannical actions taken by President Obama during his two-term presidency is simply lying to themselves.
[00:42:00.633 --> 00:42:02.655]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:42:15.137 --> 00:42:22.499]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com and I think headlines are going to look a little something like this if World War III begins.
[00:42:23.439 --> 00:42:26.940]  Nobel Peace Prize winner starts World War III.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:33.062]  I receive this honor with deep gratitude and great humility.
[00:42:34.113 --> 00:42:37.757]  He was cited for re-engaging America in global diplomacy.
[00:42:38.157 --> 00:42:43.543]  Yet his Peace Prize came days after he ordered thousands more troops to war in Afghanistan.
[00:42:43.964 --> 00:42:52.573]  The Norwegian Nobel Committee saw fit to give the Nobel Peace Prize to Barack Obama for his promotion of nuclear non-proliferation.
[00:42:53.462 --> 00:42:57.266]  Climate change and reaching out to the Muslim world.
[00:42:57.727 --> 00:42:59.669]  And that's something that he's definitely done.
[00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:02.052]  He's definitely reached out to the Muslim world.
[00:43:02.072 --> 00:43:05.015]  He definitely has not reached out to our U.S.
[00:43:05.095 --> 00:43:07.038]  veterans, to our American people.
[00:43:08.746 --> 00:43:15.789]  There has been hope for the Muslim world and there has been change drastically for the American people.
[00:43:16.149 --> 00:43:22.971]  And now this Nobel Peace Prize winner, the same guy who wants open borders to let attacks happen in the U.S.
[00:43:22.991 --> 00:43:32.055]  like we've seen in, say, Paris, Nice, Belgium, Berlin, all around Europe, he wants those attacks to happen here.
[00:43:32.475 --> 00:43:38.077]  This is the same guy that wants to start World War III, a nuclear holocaust, but luckily
[00:43:38.737 --> 00:43:41.639]  President-elect Donald Trump has taken the high road.
[00:43:41.679 --> 00:43:45.301]  He'd rather have an ally out of Vladimir Putin.
[00:43:45.321 --> 00:43:48.884]  He'd rather make Russia-US relations much stronger.
[00:43:49.324 --> 00:43:54.628]  And we also have Vladimir Putin on the other side, who is willing to take the high road as well.
[00:43:54.988 --> 00:43:56.169]  Now, if you look back,
[00:43:56.869 --> 00:44:09.014]  To this it says President Obama expels 35 Russian diplomats in Cold War deja vu as everybody including American people will be glad to see the last of this hapless administration.
[00:44:09.434 --> 00:44:12.875]  This was tweeted out yesterday by the Russian Embassy in the UK.
[00:44:13.515 --> 00:44:15.716]  And now we have a new article up by Zero Hedge.
[00:44:15.856 --> 00:44:16.616]  Putin stunner!
[00:44:16.636 --> 00:44:18.017]  We will not expel anyone.
[00:44:18.397 --> 00:44:20.798]  We refuse to sink to kitchen diplomacy.
[00:44:22.955 --> 00:44:23.756]  Bravo!
[00:44:24.297 --> 00:44:32.706]  Trump, Putin, taking the high road and showing and exposing Barack Obama truly for what he is, a piece of filth.
[00:44:32.946 --> 00:44:38.673]  Following this morning's reports that Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov would recommend a Russia president,
[00:44:39.033 --> 00:44:46.280]  Vladimir Putin a retaliation in kind and expel 35 American diplomats saying that we cannot leave such acts unanswered.
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:58.531]  Reciprocity is part of diplomatic law with Putin spokesman Peskov adding that there is no doubt that Russia's adequate and mere response will make Washington officials feel very uncomfortable as well.
[00:44:59.232 --> 00:45:01.553]  But it was ultimately up to Putin to decide what to do.
[00:45:02.033 --> 00:45:05.574]  And today he came out and there was a stunning reversal.
[00:45:05.934 --> 00:45:15.217]  The Russian leader took the high road, rejected the Lavrov proposal, and in a statement posted by the Kremlin said that Russia won't expel any Americans in retaliation to U.S.
[00:45:15.317 --> 00:45:20.378]  moves in a brutal demonstration just to show how irrelevant Obama is.
[00:45:20.578 --> 00:45:21.919]  And that is what he is.
[00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:23.019]  Irrelevant.
[00:45:23.479 --> 00:45:25.980]  I don't think that we're going to be on the verge of World War III.
[00:45:27.353 --> 00:45:50.665]  If both Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump know that this is just Obama grasping for whatever he can to remain relevant these last 20-something days that are left, it's pretty pathetic and it's quite disgusting to see how this guy has gone from this Nobel Peace Prize winner to, hey, let's go start a war and end life as we know it.
[00:45:50.765 --> 00:45:51.406]  That'll be good.
[00:45:51.826 --> 00:45:54.688]  You know, it's mind-blowing to see that.
[00:45:55.168 --> 00:46:01.531]  And from a military standpoint, I don't think many generals out there would even listen to Obama on this.
[00:46:01.611 --> 00:46:03.452]  And second of all, you've got to go through Congress.
[00:46:03.512 --> 00:46:09.055]  I mean, does anybody really want to risk the chance of us going into nuclear war?
[00:46:09.716 --> 00:46:15.098]  Well, if it does happen, remember, Nobel Peace Prize winner started World War III.
[00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:17.880]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:46:18.206 --> 00:46:23.888]  So the committee was disappointed in their choice for Obama as the Peace Prize winner, just like the rest of the world.
[00:46:34.195 --> 00:46:35.756]  And all you ISIS people threatening us?
[00:46:35.996 --> 00:46:37.477]  Hey, we're not a French newspaper.
[00:46:37.937 --> 00:46:38.177]  Okay?
[00:46:38.478 --> 00:46:41.339]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:46:41.539 --> 00:46:43.240]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:44.541]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:46:44.901 --> 00:46:45.602]  This is Texas.
[00:46:45.822 --> 00:46:46.643]  You wanna threaten me?
[00:46:46.723 --> 00:46:47.823]  You can go straight to hell.
[00:46:47.863 --> 00:46:48.484]  You understand that?
[00:46:48.664 --> 00:46:54.387]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:46:54.847 --> 00:46:58.690]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:47:03.024 --> 00:47:11.171]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:20.958]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.379 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.302 --> 00:47:28.304]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.324 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.
[00:47:53.493 --> 00:47:54.533]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.

[00:48:59.628 --> 00:49:02.290]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:05.811 --> 00:49:08.954]  Well, we've had some very interesting developments to close out 2016.
[00:49:09.234 --> 00:49:13.277]  The elites have officially been put on notice.
[00:49:14.098 --> 00:49:16.520]  The Bilderberg website has been hacked.
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:23.806]  Now, according to Charlie Skelton of The Guardian, it looks like this message has been up on the Bilderberg website since December 22nd.
[00:49:24.447 --> 00:49:26.849]  They weren't able to capture the actual archived page.
[00:49:27.409 --> 00:49:46.907]  But this is a message, starts hack back, and there's initially a message to the people saying, basically paraphrasing, wake up you guys, we're being controlled, we're being owned, we're all being very selfish, egotistical right now, but a few of us are really taking advantage of this and abusing their power.
[00:49:48.048 --> 00:49:50.709]  And they're abusing the power and using it against the weak.
[00:49:51.049 --> 00:49:58.991]  History is repeating itself, and we're all just mindless dolts while being told, work hard, work hard, and you can achieve.
[00:49:59.471 --> 00:50:11.354]  Meanwhile, they're continuing on with the wealth that's passed down through each generation, and they're not sharing that wealth or that power, but they're just telling all of us to work really hard and maybe we can get a little bite of that pie.
[00:50:11.994 --> 00:50:22.349]  But then it's interesting because it has a message directly to these wealthy elites who, of course, go annually to these Bilderberg meetings, these private secretive forums.
[00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:24.973]  So it has this message directly to them.
[00:50:26.104 --> 00:50:39.756]  And this kind of sent shivers up my spine, but once it gives them a year, it says, you have one year, 365 days to truly work in favor of humans and not your private interests.
[00:50:40.197 --> 00:50:43.139]  And then it goes on to say, mind the current situation.
[00:50:43.479 --> 00:50:46.122]  We control your expensive connected cars.
[00:50:46.562 --> 00:50:49.285]  We control your connected house security devices.
[00:50:49.585 --> 00:50:52.447]  We control your daughter's laptop, your wife's mobile.
[00:50:53.288 --> 00:50:54.750]  We tape your secret meetings.
[00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:55.971]  We read your emails.
[00:50:56.272 --> 00:50:59.676]  We control your favorite escort girl, your smart watch.
[00:51:00.096 --> 00:51:04.582]  We are inside your beloved banks and we are reading your assets.
[00:51:04.942 --> 00:51:08.627]  You won't be safe anywhere near electricity anymore.
[00:51:08.867 --> 00:51:09.828]  We will watch you.
[00:51:10.489 --> 00:51:12.591]  From now on, you've got to work for us.
[00:51:12.651 --> 00:51:28.083]  So they're basically saying, look, you're the ones that have built this prison planet, thinking that you're going to enslave all of humanity and control all of us and do away with the dollar so that you can control all the cash flow and all the banks, you know, and scandalously rob the people of our money.
[00:51:28.463 --> 00:51:30.425]  They're turning it around on them saying, look,
[00:51:30.905 --> 00:51:34.926]  You're the ones that are trying to give us driverless cars, so we have no control, no freedom.
[00:51:34.966 --> 00:51:35.446]  But guess what?
[00:51:35.806 --> 00:51:37.566]  We can hack into those cars.
[00:51:38.066 --> 00:51:41.847]  And then at the very end, it gives a greeting to Phineas Fisher.
[00:51:41.867 --> 00:51:44.047]  It says, cheers to Phineas Fisher.
[00:51:44.447 --> 00:51:46.208]  You're one of the greatest humans alive.
[00:51:46.748 --> 00:51:50.288]  And Phineas Fisher is a notorious hacker.
[00:51:50.708 --> 00:51:57.070]  He was able to kind of famously last year, we reported on this, he hacked into an Italian security firm.
[00:51:57.490 --> 00:51:58.990]  And this Italian security firm
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:06.141]  Can't find the name right now, but they are actually the ones who develop these spying tools to governments all over the world.
[00:52:06.161 --> 00:52:12.443]  So they're selling all these spying tools, all of these kind of oppressive instruments to these oppressive regimes.
[00:52:12.823 --> 00:52:21.885]  So Phineas Fisher last year hacked in to this security firm and put out all of their, you know, all of their information.
[00:52:22.865 --> 00:52:25.567]  via their Twitter account that they also hacked into.
[00:52:26.167 --> 00:52:33.532]  They published all their emails, all their files, all their source codes, and it was accompanied by a link to a torrent file, 400 gigs.
[00:52:34.252 --> 00:52:45.159]  So this is a, you know, Phineas Fisher is basically like, we will hack you, we have the means, we've done it before, and so that little nod to Phineas Fisher at the end was very telling.
[00:52:45.179 --> 00:52:46.820]  The elites have been put on notice.
[00:52:47.261 --> 00:52:48.802]  Owen Troyer, to me, this is
[00:52:49.542 --> 00:52:50.202]  Pretty thrilling.
[00:52:50.242 --> 00:52:51.662]  We'll see if anything comes of this.
[00:52:51.902 --> 00:52:54.143]  You know, obviously, 365 days.
[00:52:54.943 --> 00:52:55.583]  What do you think?
[00:52:55.623 --> 00:52:58.764]  Do you think there's anyone that's actually going to these Bilderberg meetings that's sweating?
[00:52:58.804 --> 00:53:03.905]  We know usually it's the above the law, like we see with Clinton, but... Well, it's the age-old question.
[00:53:03.985 --> 00:53:05.545]  Who's watching the watchers?
[00:53:05.925 --> 00:53:11.826]  And you take this message at its word, at face value, they're claiming they've got it.
[00:53:12.046 --> 00:53:12.726]  They're hacking.
[00:53:12.846 --> 00:53:13.987]  They are no longer safe.
[00:53:14.047 --> 00:53:15.567]  Now they are watching the watchers.
[00:53:16.587 --> 00:53:17.407]  Can we buy that?
[00:53:17.667 --> 00:53:19.028]  Is there any legitimacy to that?
[00:53:19.148 --> 00:53:20.048]  Is that an empty threat?
[00:53:20.229 --> 00:53:22.449]  Obviously, we can't tell right now.
[00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:29.172]  But, it does kind of add this weird element of suspense, whether or not the Bilderberg group feels it or not.
[00:53:29.292 --> 00:53:34.134]  I think we all kind of feel it, because it's like, well, do we actually have this strength now?
[00:53:34.194 --> 00:53:40.077]  Do we, the people, actually have the ability to put the fear into these people that they've been putting into us?
[00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:45.199]  Are they, just like he said, when he talks about you're not safe around electricity, I mean, it's the same for us.
[00:53:46.079 --> 00:53:51.261]  If me and Leanne are having a conversation and my phone is out, well then they can record that conversation.
[00:53:51.321 --> 00:53:52.882]  They can turn on my camera right now.
[00:53:53.182 --> 00:53:55.223]  And that's what the governments have been telling all of us.
[00:53:55.263 --> 00:53:58.744]  This was the big message when Edward Snowden exposed what was going on with the NSA.
[00:53:59.264 --> 00:54:03.446]  The big message, and all the media was running around with this as well, and they just were like, it's fine.
[00:54:03.806 --> 00:54:08.169]  They were saying, if you've got nothing to hide, then you have nothing to worry about.
[00:54:08.509 --> 00:54:20.437]  And then, turns out, you know, when it happened to Hillary Clinton and everyone at the DNC, they weren't very happy about it, and now they're willing to go to war with Russia, allegedly because they leaked these emails to WikiLeaks.
[00:54:20.557 --> 00:54:28.402]  So, they themselves, when they're exposed, that's a big problem, even though Obama promised to be the most transparent administration ever.
[00:54:29.302 --> 00:54:34.226]  Um, so when they're exposed, when they're put on notice, they're being surveilled, they don't like it.
[00:54:34.626 --> 00:54:39.870]  The prison plan, it was meant to be for all of us, but they're basically saying, no, we're going to turn the tables around on you.
[00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:42.912]  Is this the technocracy being used against them?
[00:54:42.952 --> 00:54:55.622]  The same, you know, mechanisms that they've used to form the, uh, you know, human domain, mapping out everything in the digital age, is now this something that can be flipped and used against them?
[00:54:55.862 --> 00:54:56.883]  And of course, you know,
[00:54:57.623 --> 00:54:59.543]  If you don't have anything to hide, what do you have to worry about?
[00:54:59.723 --> 00:55:02.744]  Well, I think we know they've got something to hide.
[00:55:02.864 --> 00:55:03.104]  Right.
[00:55:03.264 --> 00:55:18.167]  And what I appreciate about this message is that not only is it putting out this call to the people, but then also kind of in the middle, it gives these elites the opportunity to sort of check within and say, look, you know, this is the time for you guys.
[00:55:18.207 --> 00:55:18.747]  We beg you.
[00:55:18.767 --> 00:55:19.267]  We support.
[00:55:19.327 --> 00:55:21.208]  Without you, the public, we can't do anything.
[00:55:21.308 --> 00:55:22.148]  Listen to your heart.
[00:55:22.268 --> 00:55:23.148]  See the situation.
[00:55:23.668 --> 00:55:25.649]  You can make the world a better place.
[00:55:25.669 --> 00:55:26.809]  So it's almost like appealing.
[00:55:27.389 --> 00:55:29.971]  Not everyone is bad that goes to Bilderberg.
[00:55:30.031 --> 00:55:31.613]  They invite all sorts of people there.
[00:55:32.213 --> 00:55:34.936]  But there really are people that have the ability to change the world.
[00:55:35.016 --> 00:55:37.958]  So it's just kind of like, look, we're putting you on notice.
[00:55:38.018 --> 00:55:39.660]  You have a chance to do the right thing.
[00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:44.144]  Otherwise, you're going to be exposed just like Clinton and Podesta.
[00:55:44.224 --> 00:55:44.964]  Well, here's the thing.
[00:55:45.105 --> 00:55:48.747]  Whether they take these threats seriously or not, we'll never know.
[00:55:48.767 --> 00:55:53.250]  It's not like they're going to make some statement like, oh, we're scared, we're at risk for hacking.
[00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:55.011]  No, they'll probably just brush this off.
[00:55:55.571 --> 00:56:02.956]  But the real way to actually hold the Bilderbergers' feet to the fire is for public awareness.
[00:56:03.576 --> 00:56:12.144]  If every person on planet Earth knew about the Bilderberg Group, knew what they did, they wouldn't be able to operate in the mannerisms that they do.
[00:56:12.184 --> 00:56:16.788]  They wouldn't be able to pull all these strings, pull all these levers for power like they're doing.
[00:56:16.868 --> 00:56:23.574]  So we've already seen it come such a far way where, you know, ten years ago they would say that the Bilderberg Group didn't exist.
[00:56:24.995 --> 00:56:25.895]  Entered mainstream news.
[00:56:25.915 --> 00:56:30.938]  Just a couple of years ago we actually forced the media to cover it and that's just what's so incredible.
[00:56:30.958 --> 00:56:38.481]  I know there's like a law that talks about how quickly things begin to advance and as soon as it starts to accelerate and that's what's happening here.
[00:56:38.501 --> 00:56:43.323]  I mean for 20 something years Alex has been talking about the Bilderberg meetings that didn't exist, conspiracy theory.
[00:56:43.583 --> 00:56:46.684]  Then in just the last couple of years they were forced to create a website.
[00:56:46.824 --> 00:56:48.105]  Now they put out their agenda.
[00:56:48.605 --> 00:56:52.807]  Now here we are when they're going to be hacked and exposed
[00:56:53.987 --> 00:56:54.727]  What a time to be alive.
[00:56:54.747 --> 00:56:55.308]  I think it's amazing.
[00:56:55.348 --> 00:57:09.653]  And so George Soros coming out saying Trump is a would-be dictator, everything he's got going on with his Open Society Foundation and all the different uprisings that he has personally invested in and bankrolled, he is going to be exposed.
[00:57:09.993 --> 00:57:12.534]  All of the evil demons, there is nowhere to hide.
[00:57:12.894 --> 00:57:15.575]  The light is shining in all of the shadows.
[00:57:16.135 --> 00:57:19.416]  And, you know, who knew technology would be the way?
[00:57:19.436 --> 00:57:21.657]  And no wonder they want to control it and shut it down.
[00:57:22.059 --> 00:57:27.342]  Well, and speaking of ramping up, this is something that's non-political but is happening around the earth right now.
[00:57:27.783 --> 00:57:31.105]  Volcanic activity strengthening around the world.
[00:57:31.645 --> 00:57:36.508]  You had volcanoes in Italy, Peru, Japan, Alaska, all increasing their activity.
[00:57:37.068 --> 00:57:45.914]  And we've been hearing about this for a while, but also experts reveal earthquakes in Nevada would have killed people and cost more than a billion dollars
[00:57:46.554 --> 00:57:55.967]  If they would have hit just 90 miles north, there's also increased earthquake activity happening on the west coast of the United States right now and in other places around the world.
[00:57:56.487 --> 00:57:58.610]  Obviously, there was another tsunami in Japan recently.
[00:57:58.670 --> 00:58:02.155]  So, you know, these are the kind of things that we only see.
[00:58:04.025 --> 00:58:22.653]  We only seem to care about these things after they happen, but it appears that more people are bringing these, you know, things to light, so hopefully people can prepare and, you know, hey, you know, you might need some emergency food, you might need an emergency plan, hopefully we don't have a big volcano or earthquake, but you need to be aware that these things are possible.
[00:58:22.853 --> 00:58:35.095]  Right, well and it's interesting, when I went to go cover the Napa earthquake a couple of years ago, I talked with a scientist there and he said, for the state of California to put together this program that would give the citizens there a 10 second warning.
[00:58:35.175 --> 00:58:41.356]  It's not much, but 10 seconds, you know, a surgeon could lift the knife off of someone's eyeball or something if they had that warning.
[00:58:41.616 --> 00:58:45.457]  It's only like $300,000 for them to invest in this for the entire state.
[00:58:45.797 --> 00:58:46.797]  And they wouldn't even do that.
[00:58:47.178 --> 00:58:49.558]  Well, you know, they're like $300 trillion in debt over there.
[00:58:49.958 --> 00:58:53.164]  Owen, thank you so much, and thank you guys so much for tuning into the show tonight.
[00:58:53.464 --> 00:58:54.726]  We will see you guys in 2017.
[00:58:54.847 --> 00:58:55.648]  Have a happy new year.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.934]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.394 --> 00:59:20.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:29.387]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.787 --> 00:59:36.008]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.308 --> 00:59:38.608]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:39.268 --> 00:59:41.709]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
