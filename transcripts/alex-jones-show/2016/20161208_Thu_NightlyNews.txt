[00:00:20.148 --> 00:00:20.989]  Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.110]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.110]  I'm Darren McBreen.
[00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.292]  It is Thursday, December 8th, 2016.
[00:00:27.392 --> 00:00:32.676]  Here's a quick look at what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:33.752 --> 00:00:34.713]  Espionage!
[00:00:35.053 --> 00:00:43.161]  Congress passes the Intelligence Authorization Act to eliminate what the federal government is calling fake news.
[00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:44.862]  Because according to U.S.
[00:00:44.922 --> 00:00:49.647]  intelligence sources, it was the Russians who rigged the U.S.
[00:00:49.807 --> 00:00:52.950]  election in favor of Donald Trump.
[00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:01.975]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton calls for an emergency press conference and warns America about the fake news epidemic.
[00:01:02.276 --> 00:01:07.759]  But don't worry, because Silicon Valley is here to save America!
[00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:13.583]  Silicon Valley is starting to grapple with the challenge and threat of fake news.
[00:01:14.063 --> 00:01:21.568]  And that means alternative news websites might be charged with covert broadcasting and espionage.
[00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:26.099]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.954]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.
[00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:44.720]  We're making freedom go viral, and now we are proud to announce a new weapon in the epic battle against the globalists.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:05.646 --> 00:03:17.933]  Well, just like we predicted, the mainstream establishment media is continuing their complete and total meltdown over what they are calling fake news.
[00:03:18.613 --> 00:03:23.096]  And these are the guys, the same liberal hypocrites, who were
[00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:35.803]  Basically promoting all of the lies, the propaganda, the disinformation that not only came out of Barack Obama's White House, but also Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.
[00:03:36.123 --> 00:03:42.807]  I mean, when you think about it, the mainstream media has really become Obama and Hillary's very own PR department.
[00:03:43.507 --> 00:03:47.208]  Or the Ministry of Truth from George Orwell's 1984.
[00:03:47.348 --> 00:03:49.468]  That's what it reminds me of.
[00:03:49.868 --> 00:03:56.190]  We know, for example, that there were CNN reporters who colluded with the Clinton campaign.
[00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:04.972]  We also found out through Wikileaks, something we suspected all along, that Hillary was getting her debate questions in advance.
[00:04:05.552 --> 00:04:09.934]  CNN was also caught rigging the polls for Hillary.
[00:04:10.294 --> 00:04:18.076]  And remember, it was the mainstream media who said Donald Trump has no chance of winning the presidential election.
[00:04:18.436 --> 00:04:20.057]  It's not gonna happen.
[00:04:20.897 --> 00:04:23.258]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president.
[00:04:23.338 --> 00:04:26.179]  The debate is never about, can Trump win the election?
[00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:32.121]  The standard has now been reduced to, can Trump make it through the next four weeks without getting removed from the ticket?
[00:04:32.341 --> 00:04:33.482]  I talked to probably 12
[00:04:34.782 --> 00:04:38.445]  Republican senators yesterday or their representatives.
[00:04:39.326 --> 00:04:42.629]  I couldn't find a single one who now thinks they're going to win.
[00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:56.160]  Well, I make of it the fact that Mr. Trump is a serious candidate for the Republican nomination, is so stupendously incredibly idiotic, I can't even get my hands around or my head around it.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.840]  Drop out.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.304]  Simply drop out and tell America this entire candidacy was a stunt.
[00:05:01.684 --> 00:05:05.395]  Which Republican candidate has the best chance of winning the general election?
[00:05:06.438 --> 00:05:08.985]  Of the declared ones right now, Donald Trump.
[00:05:16.682 --> 00:05:21.045]  I think the real danger is, you know, Trump is going to be up on that debate stage.
[00:05:21.105 --> 00:05:26.209]  He's going to make any cut because his poll numbers will be high enough to get him up there.
[00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:32.133]  And that just kind of makes a mockery of the whole process for the Republican nomination.
[00:05:32.253 --> 00:05:41.879]  Hillary Clinton has a 100% chance of winning, so that means that in no scenario that we could lay out to get Donald Trump to 270 electoral votes, there's not going to be a President Donald Trump.
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.341]  That's not going to happen.
[00:05:44.902 --> 00:05:47.930]  Trump, I don't believe, is going to be the party's nominee.
[00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.096]  And if he is, he's going to get crushed by Hillary Clinton.
[00:05:50.117 --> 00:05:51.200]  And I wanted to point that out.
[00:05:53.735 --> 00:05:54.816]  This guy's a joke.
[00:05:55.136 --> 00:05:57.557]  We may lose by historic proportions.
[00:05:57.797 --> 00:06:04.920]  I mean, something that, well, one person said to me yesterday that could affect the Republican Party for generations to come.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.301]  I'm not sure the Republican Party's going to survive.
[00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:11.143]  I don't think there's any way that Donald Trump gets elected president of the United States.
[00:06:11.223 --> 00:06:13.704]  Tomorrow night, I think, when Hillary Clinton wins, that
[00:06:15.445 --> 00:06:21.650]  Donald Trump will have lost this election from the very first day he announced it.
[00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.092]  We couldn't help her any more than we have.
[00:06:23.172 --> 00:06:23.772]  I know.
[00:06:23.792 --> 00:06:26.554]  She's got just a free ride so far from the media.
[00:06:26.574 --> 00:06:28.296]  We're the biggest ones promoting her campaign.
[00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:30.969]  That's right.
[00:06:31.109 --> 00:06:35.651]  Nobody has been the victim of fake news more than Donald Trump.
[00:06:36.611 --> 00:06:41.012]  I mean, he was ambushed from all sides of the mainstream news media.
[00:06:41.412 --> 00:06:42.193]  And I got news for you.
[00:06:42.233 --> 00:06:43.513]  They are not going to stop.
[00:06:43.733 --> 00:06:49.675]  OK, they're just getting started because they are going to do everything in their power to destroy him.
[00:06:50.155 --> 00:06:52.036]  I mean, hell, it was just a couple of days ago.
[00:06:52.816 --> 00:06:57.299]  When CNN, they ran another fake news segment about Donald Trump.
[00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:04.423]  This time they said he was getting ready to round up Muslims and throw them into internment camps.
[00:07:04.844 --> 00:07:07.405]  I mean, how ridiculous is that?
[00:07:07.865 --> 00:07:08.706]  Come on, man.
[00:07:09.526 --> 00:07:11.248]  And hey, I'll let you in on a little secret.
[00:07:12.301 --> 00:07:16.644]  Donald Trump is not afraid of the mainstream media.
[00:07:17.144 --> 00:07:24.708]  And they've done everything they can to intimidate him, belittle him, and even blackmail him into backing down.
[00:07:25.188 --> 00:07:26.169]  But it's not happening.
[00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:29.131]  That what doesn't kill Trump only makes him stronger.
[00:07:29.671 --> 00:07:33.293]  And thank God for the alternative in social media.
[00:07:33.733 --> 00:07:37.674]  Because I don't think Trump would have had a chance in hell without the internet.
[00:07:37.974 --> 00:07:47.658]  In fact, we'd probably be looking at a Jeb Bush presidency, or God forbid, Hillary Clinton, if it wasn't for the World Wide Web.
[00:07:48.058 --> 00:07:51.260]  The mainstream media, they can't handle the Trump.
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.180]  They don't know what to do about this guy.
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.622]  They've never seen anybody quite like him before.
[00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:09.185]  And I guess the establishment figures, if they could shut us down, Breitbart, Infowars, Drudge Report, you know, if they could shut down alternative and social media, they can shut Donald Trump down.
[00:08:09.606 --> 00:08:13.551]  And that, my friends, that is their new battle plan.
[00:08:17.159 --> 00:08:19.681]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president.
[00:08:19.701 --> 00:08:21.442]  Can Donald Trump win a general election?
[00:08:21.882 --> 00:08:23.163]  My view is no, but we'll see.
[00:08:23.263 --> 00:08:23.583]  Why not?
[00:08:24.183 --> 00:08:31.768]  Well, if Mitt Romney lost with 27% among Latinos, how good would somebody do who's got an 11% approval rating?
[00:08:31.788 --> 00:08:35.490]  This guy, in my view, is not going to be elected president, and he's got a ceiling.
[00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:39.433]  And your basic argument is that the premise here, he's not going to win all four of those things.
[00:08:39.453 --> 00:08:39.593]  No!
[00:08:39.633 --> 00:08:39.713]  No!
[00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:47.195]  The decision desk has called Pennsylvania for Donald Trump.
[00:08:47.755 --> 00:08:53.796]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:08:55.016 --> 00:08:59.697]  Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division.
[00:08:59.737 --> 00:09:00.937]  We have to get together.
[00:09:02.378 --> 00:09:09.739]  To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us
[00:09:11.004 --> 00:09:14.146]  We come together as one united people.
[00:09:16.868 --> 00:09:17.908]  You're awake, by the way.
[00:09:18.549 --> 00:09:20.450]  You're not having a terrible, terrible dream.
[00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.791]  Also, you're not dead, and you haven't gone to hell.
[00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:24.232]  This is your life now.
[00:09:24.372 --> 00:09:25.273]  This is our election now.
[00:09:25.373 --> 00:09:25.873]  This is us.
[00:09:25.993 --> 00:09:26.894]  This is our country.
[00:09:26.934 --> 00:09:28.675]  America is crying tonight.
[00:09:28.795 --> 00:09:32.597]  I'm not sure how much of America, but a very, very significant portion.
[00:09:32.617 --> 00:09:34.758]  And I mean literally crying.
[00:09:34.778 --> 00:09:35.319]  I'm sorry.
[00:09:35.359 --> 00:09:37.120]  It's just, it's not okay.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:37.820]  It's okay.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.160]  Take a moment.
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:38.541]  I'm sorry.
[00:09:39.982 --> 00:09:45.787]  When you both consider the events over the next 36 hours, this was a white lash.
[00:09:46.247 --> 00:09:51.692]  Investigators are also looking into who breached voter databases in the states of Illinois and Arizona.
[00:09:52.012 --> 00:09:55.955]  For his part, President Putin has denied any tampering.
[00:09:56.015 --> 00:09:57.176]  I don't know anything about it.
[00:09:57.577 --> 00:10:00.019]  And on a state level, Russia has never done this.
[00:10:00.699 --> 00:10:24.600]  And to further that sentiment of total fear porn now spiraling out of control from the left, Hillary Clinton mouthpiece central the Washington Post backed up the website Prop or Not's claim that 200 websites wittingly or unwittingly published or echoed Russian propaganda.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.043]  Of course, Infowars was at the top of the list.
[00:10:28.643 --> 00:10:36.308]  The Washington Post's attack on independent media was later modified with a retraction.
[00:10:36.408 --> 00:10:55.699]  The Washington Post wrote, The Post, which did not name any of the sites, does not itself vouch for the validity of Prop or Not's findings regarding any individual media outlet, nor did the article purport to do so, since publication of the Post's story, Prop or Not, has removed some sites from its list.
[00:10:56.099 --> 00:11:07.014]  Regardless of the fact that the Washington Post had engaged in fake news, the very same article went on to lecture its readers on methods of identifying fake news.
[00:11:07.314 --> 00:11:09.077]  How do we do better prices for our audience?
[00:11:09.097 --> 00:11:10.058]  Because that's how I want to be treated.
[00:11:10.398 --> 00:11:12.141]  Meanwhile, they're just like, how do we screw everyone?
[00:11:12.201 --> 00:11:12.702]  Oh yeah!
[00:11:13.142 --> 00:11:13.603]  Oh yeah!
[00:11:14.043 --> 00:11:15.945]  But then on air, it's like, oh, I'm liberal.
[00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:21.031]  Oh, I have the moral high ground fighting racism and sexism and homophobia.
[00:11:21.331 --> 00:11:23.193]  Really, Obamacare doubles prices in the first year.
[00:11:23.733 --> 00:11:25.155]  Shut up, racist.
[00:11:25.635 --> 00:11:27.097]  Why are you getting upset?
[00:11:27.117 --> 00:11:28.278]  Because I'm for real!
[00:11:29.324 --> 00:11:34.607]  So, self-proclaimed hack journalist calls on social media to censor fake news.
[00:11:34.947 --> 00:11:40.090]  Hillary supporters, still reeling over devastating loss, call for censorship of independent media.
[00:11:40.431 --> 00:11:47.455]  I mean, this is like your restaurant can't get any businesses because you got caught with cockroaches in all your food and rat droppings, and it was on the news.
[00:11:47.735 --> 00:11:49.116]  The health department shut you down for a week.
[00:11:49.496 --> 00:11:50.937]  No one's pulling up to eat your food.
[00:11:52.131 --> 00:11:52.471]  No one.
[00:11:52.491 --> 00:11:52.931]  What do you do?
[00:11:53.712 --> 00:11:57.753]  You start whispering, oh yeah, they got cat turds in their food across the street.
[00:11:57.814 --> 00:12:00.215]  Oh yeah, they got syphilis on the hamburgers.
[00:12:00.435 --> 00:12:02.035]  Oh yeah, we did it.
[00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:06.537]  And then they start calling, health department calls, oh, you know, Bob's across the street.
[00:12:06.617 --> 00:12:08.538]  They're the ones that got really dirty stuff.
[00:12:09.038 --> 00:12:15.961]  And then they run over and like throw cat droppings, you know, under the bar stools, right as the inspector comes in.
[00:12:16.201 --> 00:12:17.802]  Look, look, it's there.
[00:12:17.822 --> 00:12:19.423]  Then shut them down.
[00:12:20.003 --> 00:12:22.146]  Hubris is a heavy drug.
[00:12:22.347 --> 00:12:24.370]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.681]  Paul Craig Roberts, the father of Reaganomics, joins us now.
[00:12:28.761 --> 00:12:34.664]  And I wanted to get your take on all this, because fake news, that is the new talking point.
[00:12:35.164 --> 00:12:42.828]  I mean, you cannot watch the mainstream news media right now for more than a couple of minutes without hearing about fake news, right?
[00:12:42.888 --> 00:12:45.869]  And now, unfortunately, it looks like the U.S.
[00:12:45.929 --> 00:12:53.713]  intelligence agencies are getting involved, and they say Russia helped rig the election in favor of Donald Trump.
[00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:58.596]  And they did it by spreading fake news throughout the internet.
[00:12:58.636 --> 00:13:00.077]  Paul Craig Roberts, thanks for being here.
[00:13:02.438 --> 00:13:03.339]  Glad to be with you.
[00:13:03.419 --> 00:13:06.261]  Now we have one Russian agent talking to another.
[00:13:06.738 --> 00:13:07.299]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:13:07.319 --> 00:13:08.540]  That's the next thing, right?
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.941]  We're going to be Russian agents.
[00:13:10.281 --> 00:13:13.704]  Well, tell us about this bill, because I thought that was pretty scary.
[00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:17.688]  There's a new bill that was just passed by Congress to help the U.S.
[00:13:17.748 --> 00:13:30.539]  government fight covert influence by the Russians, and this is supposed to stop them from spreading fake news in our country, but it looks like they might stop the First Amendment in the process.
[00:13:31.957 --> 00:13:32.237]  Yes.
[00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:45.423]  Well, this is a Title V in a House of Representatives bill dealing with the intelligence agencies, you know, the compensation, all that sort.
[00:13:45.844 --> 00:13:57.009]  But someone stuck in a Title V section, which creates an interagency executive branch committee
[00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:06.214]  That is supposed to monitor and keep up with
[00:14:08.465 --> 00:14:17.832]  Sources of information that are contrary to the lines that are issued out of Washington and out of the presstitutes.
[00:14:18.493 --> 00:14:19.113]  Okay.
[00:14:19.393 --> 00:14:28.400]  The press and the printed newspapers and the TV stations such as the Washington Post, New York Times, CNN.
[00:14:29.081 --> 00:14:35.706]  So anything that is said contrary to the real fake news
[00:14:36.346 --> 00:14:40.673]  Because all the fake news comes from the prostitutes.
[00:14:41.254 --> 00:14:41.434]  Yeah.
[00:14:42.055 --> 00:14:43.597]  So anything, any truth
[00:14:44.724 --> 00:14:57.927]  Or any reasonable analysis, this is now declared as Russian efforts to subvert America with propaganda.
[00:14:57.967 --> 00:15:10.809]  All right, so like, okay, so if you and I, for example, if we don't talk bad about Vladimir Putin, that might make us a Russian spy or a foreign agent or perhaps espionage?
[00:15:11.462 --> 00:15:13.626]  Yeah, there's no might about it.
[00:15:13.726 --> 00:15:15.530]  It definitely makes you want it.
[00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:31.116]  Guilty of being against America because we don't lie for Washington or for the prestigious media.
[00:15:31.196 --> 00:15:37.699]  So what they're doing, they're turning, if you tell the truth, it means you're a Russian agent.
[00:15:37.959 --> 00:15:41.301]  In order to be an American agent, you have to tell lies.
[00:15:42.886 --> 00:15:44.327]  Look, look, this is breaking.
[00:15:44.427 --> 00:15:58.676]  I want to share this video with you because Hillary Clinton, she just had a press conference talking about the epidemic of fake news where she said Congress is pushing through legislation to fight foreign propaganda.
[00:15:58.957 --> 00:16:00.618]  Check this out and I want to get your thoughts on it.
[00:16:02.479 --> 00:16:09.704]  The epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that flooded social media over the past year
[00:16:10.871 --> 00:16:16.073]  It's now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences.
[00:16:17.194 --> 00:16:19.815]  This isn't about politics or partisanship.
[00:16:19.955 --> 00:16:20.715]  Oh, no, no.
[00:16:20.775 --> 00:16:21.896]  Lives are at risk.
[00:16:22.396 --> 00:16:28.719]  Lives of ordinary people just trying to go about their days, to do their jobs, contribute to their communities.
[00:16:29.619 --> 00:16:32.801]  It's a danger that must be addressed, and addressed quickly.
[00:16:33.789 --> 00:16:45.452]  Bipartisan legislation is making its way through Congress to boost the government's response to foreign propaganda, and Silicon Valley is starting to grapple with the challenge and threat of fake news.
[00:16:46.272 --> 00:16:54.173]  Wow, and I think the scariest part about that, Silicon Valley, does that mean Facebook, Twitter, social media, they're a target as well?
[00:16:55.214 --> 00:16:56.214]  It means Google.
[00:16:56.614 --> 00:16:56.774]  Yep.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:05.964]  Yeah, what they're going to do, see, fake news is what was used against Trump.
[00:17:06.004 --> 00:17:06.664]  We all know that.
[00:17:06.745 --> 00:17:07.685]  It didn't work.
[00:17:08.766 --> 00:17:10.647]  It's not working now.
[00:17:10.687 --> 00:17:15.770]  You know, when they branded me a slave agent, I wrote a spoof about it.
[00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:16.791]  It had great fun.
[00:17:16.811 --> 00:17:18.692]  It went viral all over the world.
[00:17:20.633 --> 00:17:25.156]  The Russians announced they were going to give me a passport to rescue me from
[00:17:27.684 --> 00:17:31.695]  Let's hope they don't have to, but I guess it's good to have that in your back pocket, I guess.
[00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:33.291]  They've been ridiculed.
[00:17:33.311 --> 00:17:41.996]  What they're trying to do now, and the whole purpose of this list, is to lend credence to this House bill, which has passed.
[00:17:42.036 --> 00:17:43.918]  That's what Hillary was talking about.
[00:17:44.998 --> 00:17:46.219]  This House bill.
[00:17:46.639 --> 00:17:56.086]  And if you have an interagency executive branch committee that's supposed to keep up with this, then obviously they're supposed to do something about it.
[00:17:57.154 --> 00:18:12.579]  And so they can very easily use Google and they will essentially close down, that's the plan, the websites that people have turned to to find out what's really happening.
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.620]  And so that's the list of 200.
[00:18:18.141 --> 00:18:23.723]  It was really quite stupid of them to produce a list so now people know where to go to get good information.
[00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:32.997]  The purpose is to discredit us as anti-American.
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:46.203]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:19:46.884 --> 00:19:48.465]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:19:48.865 --> 00:19:53.848]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:19:54.208 --> 00:19:59.652]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:20:00.052 --> 00:20:06.636]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:20:07.277 --> 00:20:08.438]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:20:09.278 --> 00:20:11.219]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.501]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:20:14.942 --> 00:20:18.564]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:20:18.744 --> 00:20:21.306]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:20:21.366 --> 00:20:33.714]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:20:33.934 --> 00:20:39.055]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:40.496]  It's bound.
[00:20:40.776 --> 00:20:41.776]  It's not absorbable.
[00:20:42.196 --> 00:20:46.758]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:20:46.978 --> 00:20:51.879]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride and all these other bad halogens.
[00:20:52.239 --> 00:20:55.940]  It's such a game changer if you'll just research iodine for yourself.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.681]  It's a fact that the federal government in the Midwest back in the 20s
[00:20:59.241 --> 00:21:08.206]  Mandated a grungier form of iodine to the salt because people had low IQs, they had huge goiters, major problems directly connected to it.
[00:21:08.386 --> 00:21:12.048]  There are some studies that show a 15 point increase, others show even higher.
[00:21:12.208 --> 00:21:25.656]  But it really is crazy to realize that this is something that is so deficient in our food chain, so deficient in our played out fields where different crops are being grown, but the federal government isn't educating people and telling them about it.
[00:21:25.856 --> 00:21:37.399]  That's why for a limited time, I want to encourage everyone to go to Infowarslife.com and get 20% off on the best nascent iodine out there from our research, Truly Pure Survival Shield X2.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.260]  Again, that's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.461]  Thank you for joining us in this brief news update.
[00:21:43.841 --> 00:21:48.743]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:21:48.823 --> 00:21:49.983]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:52.724]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:21:52.884 --> 00:21:53.104]  Of course!
[00:22:15.742 --> 00:22:19.404]  You've got to have vitamin C, you've got to have iodine to live, you've got to have water to live.
[00:22:19.744 --> 00:22:30.249]  Iodine is key, you must have it, but consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com, or call toll free, we can answer your questions, 888-253-3139.
[00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:32.630]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[00:22:43.925 --> 00:22:45.387]  It's a fight for our minds.
[00:22:46.048 --> 00:22:47.971]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[00:22:48.311 --> 00:22:52.517]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:22:52.657 --> 00:22:56.002]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[00:22:56.082 --> 00:22:57.644]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:23:02.893 --> 00:23:19.261]  Obviously Donald Trump is not going to fall for it because he's basically bypassed the mainstream media, went over their heads by using Twitter, you know, social media and all the alternative news media websites to go over their head and get his message out to the American people.
[00:23:19.641 --> 00:23:21.903]  What do you expect Donald Trump to do about this?
[00:23:22.363 --> 00:23:23.764]  And you've got the last word.
[00:23:23.884 --> 00:23:24.544]  Paul Craig Rivers.
[00:23:25.026 --> 00:23:28.613]  Okay, well of course he's also identified as part of the conspiracy.
[00:23:29.074 --> 00:23:31.840]  Because he was working with Putin and the rest of us.
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.142]  Oh yeah, he's part of it, right?
[00:23:33.182 --> 00:23:34.084]  He's part of the whole thing.
[00:23:34.939 --> 00:23:42.863]  What he needs to do, he needs to investigate what aspects of the United States government are behind this, who's involved.
[00:23:44.184 --> 00:23:49.207]  If it's some elements of the intelligence community, he's got to hold them responsible, clean them out.
[00:23:50.267 --> 00:23:57.851]  If it is the National Endowment for Democracy, which is funded by the State Department, he needs to close that down.
[00:23:59.672 --> 00:23:59.892]  But
[00:24:01.213 --> 00:24:02.635]  It may well be.
[00:24:02.655 --> 00:24:06.058]  See, we can't find out who is behind this website.
[00:24:06.198 --> 00:24:12.605]  It's hidden behind several removed fake names.
[00:24:13.066 --> 00:24:17.570]  Nobody knows who they are, where the money is, but Cam Martens of
[00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:32.812]  Wall Street Parade has investigated and she finds background links to the Koch brothers, to the Bradley Foundation, the Scaife Foundation,
[00:24:35.214 --> 00:24:36.275]  To two U.S.
[00:24:36.315 --> 00:24:42.403]  Senators, and she's published this on her website, and she's still investigating.
[00:24:42.784 --> 00:24:48.791]  So this is a group that is so secret, we can't find out who they are.
[00:24:49.707 --> 00:25:01.797]  So, either it is some public element in there that the government has to hide, or the oligarchs behind it don't want to be revealed.
[00:25:02.557 --> 00:25:06.820]  So, it kind of takes away the credibility of the charge.
[00:25:06.921 --> 00:25:12.205]  If people are libeling you, but they won't even say who they are.
[00:25:13.726 --> 00:25:15.428]  It doesn't really have any credibility.
[00:25:15.828 --> 00:25:34.164]  So I don't know what Trump's going to do, but it's really disturbing that the House would go along with this Title V stuck into a bill which mainly is about the scope of intelligence agencies, their compensation, and that sort of thing.
[00:25:34.684 --> 00:25:35.565]  But that has happened.
[00:25:35.605 --> 00:25:36.686]  It did pass the House.
[00:25:36.786 --> 00:25:38.528]  So if it passes the Senate,
[00:25:39.208 --> 00:25:44.333]  Quickly, and Obama signs it, then it'll be a law that Trump will have to confront.
[00:25:45.935 --> 00:25:47.537]  It's clearly, and you know what?
[00:25:47.597 --> 00:25:52.682]  This may also be part of the effort to keep Trump from being inaugurated.
[00:25:52.862 --> 00:26:02.271]  I don't know what the vote count situation is, but there's some suspicion that these votes aren't counted by the deadline.
[00:26:03.492 --> 00:26:19.501]  That courts would rule that these votes can't be included when the Electoral College meets, and therefore neither candidate would have votes, and therefore it would go to the Congress.
[00:26:20.401 --> 00:26:23.963]  And it's the existing Congress, not the new one that's been elected.
[00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:28.886]  So, we really don't know if this isn't somehow part of that as well.
[00:26:29.206 --> 00:26:31.127]  But it is very strange, isn't it?
[00:26:31.767 --> 00:26:51.989]  That we have elements of the United States government and the mainstream media and the defeated presidential candidate who are essentially accusing the President-elect of the United States of being part of a Russian conspiracy.
[00:26:53.046 --> 00:26:58.188]  Yeah, being a stooge for Vladimir Putin, it's one of the craziest things I've ever seen.
[00:26:58.609 --> 00:27:00.810]  And they are really escalating this right now.
[00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:07.713]  And I have a feeling, I thought Hillary, they set her out there on the stage today looking rather presidential.
[00:27:08.293 --> 00:27:10.334]  And I don't know if that was by accident either.
[00:27:10.354 --> 00:27:16.937]  I tell you what, if this vote count and this whole recount goes through, we're looking at an American Civil War.
[00:27:19.238 --> 00:27:22.140]  They try to take that presidency from Trump, man, and it's going to be bad.
[00:27:22.836 --> 00:27:24.117]  If the people have it in them.
[00:27:24.717 --> 00:27:26.559]  Always a pleasure.
[00:27:43.703 --> 00:27:49.708]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for InfoWars and I'm joined in studio by Max Keiser, host of the Keiser Report for RT News.
[00:27:49.748 --> 00:27:55.213]  He's been with us all day long and you interviewed Alex recently, a couple of hours ago.
[00:27:55.273 --> 00:27:55.974]  That's going up.
[00:27:56.434 --> 00:27:58.556]  I wanted to talk to you about climate change.
[00:27:58.616 --> 00:28:00.038]  I understand that's a big issue for you.
[00:28:00.078 --> 00:28:01.699]  I've heard you talk about it a lot.
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:06.864]  Are you happy with Trump and how this is looking for an issue that's passionate for you?
[00:28:07.444 --> 00:28:14.952]  Well, I guess in the context of Infowars and Alex Jones, I guess I'm an outlier in that the climate change issue I see is a real issue.
[00:28:17.254 --> 00:28:24.722]  In my view, you've got ample evidence of rising sea levels and increased storm activity and there needs to be something done.
[00:28:25.042 --> 00:28:27.905]  Now, my view on Trump is that
[00:28:28.934 --> 00:28:38.218]  Until otherwise, I think that he's a guy who will entertain any deal that comes over and take a look at any deal that makes sense.
[00:28:38.298 --> 00:28:45.262]  I know that he's interested in jobs and he's interested in making America great again, and I would tell the lefties in the audience and the
[00:28:45.982 --> 00:29:00.339]  The Greenpeace people and the progressives to put together a pitch about opening up solar arrays in the United States and we already see some activities Google now known as Alphabet they're going to become completely
[00:29:01.199 --> 00:29:01.620]  Thank you!
[00:29:27.423 --> 00:29:28.263]  Great, I agree with you.
[00:29:28.524 --> 00:29:29.944]  Leonardo DiCaprio, of all people.
[00:29:29.964 --> 00:29:33.006]  You know, I hate it when celebrities, they go in and they talk to a president-elect.
[00:29:33.026 --> 00:29:33.746]  It really irks me.
[00:29:34.226 --> 00:29:37.508]  But he had a green job discussion with Trump, I believe, today.
[00:29:37.608 --> 00:29:39.809]  Let's shift this because we only have a few minutes with you.
[00:29:39.829 --> 00:29:40.930]  I know you're on your way out.
[00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:42.491]  WikiLeaks exposure.
[00:29:42.571 --> 00:29:43.131]  What do you think?
[00:29:43.151 --> 00:29:45.212]  Did Americans just not read the emails?
[00:29:45.232 --> 00:29:45.992]  What's going on with that?
[00:29:46.233 --> 00:29:46.893]  What's exposure?
[00:29:47.113 --> 00:30:09.460]  Well come on, so InfoWars, we've covered these mass leaks and we've tried to bring them up as much as we can, you know, in relation to the election, leading up to the election, and I noticed that on RT News, that's kind of my go-to source, I go to it every day and look at your website, you guys were the only ones that were really covering it, but it seemed like we were kind of in a bubble, like nobody was really reading them.
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:10.081]  Did you find that?
[00:30:10.101 --> 00:30:11.721]  The WikiLeaks and the Podesta emails?
[00:30:11.781 --> 00:30:14.122]  Maybe in London where you're kind of out of the
[00:30:15.205 --> 00:30:29.170]  Well, I think that, you know, the government and the entrenched oligarchy, you know, they don't have an infinite pool of resources to snuff out every single
[00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:31.431]  Thank you.
[00:30:48.991 --> 00:30:51.154]  That they just couldn't cover all the bases.
[00:30:51.454 --> 00:30:56.621]  It's like the story of the boy trying to plug the holes in the dike.
[00:30:56.661 --> 00:30:58.043]  You run out of fingers eventually.
[00:30:58.063 --> 00:31:05.232]  They just didn't have the resources to cover so much corruption over so many years and it toppled.
[00:31:05.452 --> 00:31:07.314]  Did you ever have Assange on your show?
[00:31:08.414 --> 00:31:11.898]  I've never had Assange on my show, no.
[00:31:11.918 --> 00:31:20.147]  His dad is a big fan of my show and I've talked to his dad a few times and he's been trying to get us over there to the embassy a few times.
[00:31:20.167 --> 00:31:22.369]  You need to go check and make sure he's still alive for all of us.
[00:31:22.449 --> 00:31:24.992]  I believe he's still okay.
[00:31:25.553 --> 00:31:27.335]  Alright, so Trump support.
[00:31:27.635 --> 00:31:29.157]  Were you a Trump supporter in the beginning?
[00:31:29.277 --> 00:31:29.857]  Are you one now?
[00:31:31.158 --> 00:31:44.567]  Yeah, well, with the choice being Hillary, I was definitely always in the Trump camp because I think that it's an acid test of the Constitution that it should stand the test of Trump, if it's going to stand the test of anyone.
[00:31:45.127 --> 00:31:46.808]  He's certainly the capable guy.
[00:31:46.828 --> 00:31:48.209]  He's got enough intelligence.
[00:31:48.229 --> 00:31:49.149]  He's got the resources.
[00:31:49.209 --> 00:31:51.731]  And I think he has civil service in mind.
[00:31:51.751 --> 00:31:54.272]  I think he's into the public service of being the president.
[00:31:54.292 --> 00:31:55.953]  I don't think he's just out there trying to make $100 billion.
[00:31:56.894 --> 00:31:57.114]  Right.
[00:31:57.134 --> 00:31:59.655]  Do you worry that he's staffing his cabinet with neocons?
[00:32:00.316 --> 00:32:07.659]  Well, I think that the way I see it is that, you know, it depends how these guys are managed.
[00:32:07.719 --> 00:32:22.086]  I mean, if you have a group of hard hitters in the area of banking, for example, he's got this Goldman Sachs guy and you put them to work in doing something like reducing the federal deficit by $10 trillion, those are the kind of guys who can get the job done.
[00:32:22.166 --> 00:32:25.948]  You know, if he goes to the new Treasury Secretary and says, look,
[00:32:26.468 --> 00:32:30.711]  Cut the debt by $10 trillion and we'll give Wall Street a 1% fee.
[00:32:30.871 --> 00:32:31.912]  That's a $100 billion deal.
[00:32:31.932 --> 00:32:32.292]  Right.
[00:32:32.772 --> 00:32:33.613]  Okay, that's what they do.
[00:32:33.733 --> 00:32:34.493]  That's what they're good at.
[00:32:34.734 --> 00:32:45.441]  But in the service of the agenda of putting together an economy that he, I think he sees an economy needing to support higher paying jobs and more manufacturing jobs and bring it back onshore.
[00:32:45.461 --> 00:32:45.781]  Right.
[00:32:46.331 --> 00:32:48.092]  Well, certainly, I'm with you on that.
[00:32:48.112 --> 00:32:48.792]  I agree with you.
[00:32:48.872 --> 00:32:50.773]  Max Keiser in studio with InfoWars.
[00:32:51.214 --> 00:32:52.934]  This is going to be up soon on our YouTube channel.

[00:33:02.439 --> 00:33:04.901]  More than 20 years ago when I started InfoWars,
[00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:07.211]  I was a fitness addict.
[00:33:07.431 --> 00:33:08.992]  I ran six miles almost every day.
[00:33:09.012 --> 00:33:11.835]  I would lift weights four or five days a week for up to three hours.
[00:33:12.415 --> 00:33:16.819]  I was really into what I was doing, but I also loved to go to buffets and pig out.
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:17.700]  I was a young man.
[00:33:18.301 --> 00:33:20.363]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down.
[00:33:20.743 --> 00:33:21.684]  I quit working out.
[00:33:21.764 --> 00:33:27.089]  I was working 18 hours a day, many days, on average about 14, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:33.652]  I went from 180 to right up to 280 pounds.
[00:33:33.832 --> 00:33:36.753]  And I started to exercise really hard again.
[00:33:37.173 --> 00:33:38.753]  And I started to try to eat healthier.
[00:33:39.233 --> 00:33:41.414]  But for some reason, I couldn't lose more than 20 pounds.
[00:33:41.494 --> 00:33:43.895]  Couldn't go below about 259.
[00:33:45.075 --> 00:33:46.716]  Started taking third-party supplements.
[00:33:47.116 --> 00:33:48.936]  Started seeing some more gains.
[00:33:49.457 --> 00:33:56.899]  But when I started working with Dr. Grip and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that
[00:33:57.319 --> 00:33:59.720]  The population is absolutely deficient in.
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:06.463]  Take this true atomic iodine that they were just developing and wasn't even available in stores yet.
[00:34:07.123 --> 00:34:07.464]  Boom!
[00:34:08.184 --> 00:34:09.625]  Weight started pouring off.
[00:34:09.725 --> 00:34:11.605]  Toxins started coming out of my body.
[00:34:12.106 --> 00:34:12.926]  It was incredible.
[00:34:12.966 --> 00:34:18.548]  Then I started taking DNA force, super male vitality, and I went down to 230 pounds.
[00:34:18.568 --> 00:34:24.111]  Now understand, that's losing 60, 70 pounds of fat and gaining, I don't know, 20 pounds of muscle?
[00:34:25.086 --> 00:34:25.406]  All I know
[00:34:44.918 --> 00:34:54.265]  But more importantly, I stopped taking the supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[00:34:54.365 --> 00:34:55.326]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[00:34:55.526 --> 00:35:02.051]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put Lazy Susan back on the table and I'm going to start taking it religiously again.
[00:35:02.851 --> 00:35:06.074]  And I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[00:35:06.114 --> 00:35:07.395]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[00:35:07.996 --> 00:35:12.059]  And I've already experienced what this has done before, but this time we're going to document it.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.063]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[00:35:16.624 --> 00:35:20.187]  My gut tells me I'll lose at least 10 pounds even during the holidays.
[00:35:20.567 --> 00:35:45.424]  Taking the supplements because again, it's what I've experienced before but we're gonna see I'm gonna work out just the same probably eat even more But I'm gonna take the x2 the DNA force the super male every single day as it's recommended And we're all gonna see the results look we're making America great again We're restoring the Republic and part of that is making ourselves great again our bodies great again and feeling good about ourselves I don't plan to be some Beach Boy
[00:35:46.164 --> 00:35:48.205]  I've got kind of bodybuilder form.
[00:35:48.225 --> 00:35:48.785]  I'm a big guy.
[00:35:49.085 --> 00:35:53.966]  But we're going to see what happens in the next 30 days together on this journey.
[00:35:53.986 --> 00:35:56.427]  And we'll have updates every week on what's happening.
[00:35:57.147 --> 00:36:04.529]  And we will also then obviously take the four weeks and put it all together in a special report that's going to air January 5th.
[00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.330]  Now, I'll be frank with you.
[00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:07.710]  I'm still having treats.
[00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:09.131]  I'm still living like I normally do.
[00:36:09.371 --> 00:36:10.591]  This wasn't part of what we were about to do.
[00:36:10.631 --> 00:36:11.732]  And I'm not saying it's good.
[00:36:12.052 --> 00:36:12.792]  I'm embarrassed of it.
[00:36:14.249 --> 00:36:14.929]  Mexican Coke.
[00:36:15.409 --> 00:36:17.010]  Buckley's over there and he made the joke earlier.
[00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:19.271]  Oh yeah, you're really going to lose weight drinking Mexican Coke.
[00:36:19.611 --> 00:36:20.912]  I'm just being totally transparent.
[00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:21.892]  I'm going to eat pie.
[00:36:22.252 --> 00:36:22.973]  Christmas is coming up.
[00:36:23.013 --> 00:36:24.953]  I'm going to eat ham and turkey.
[00:36:26.374 --> 00:36:26.934]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:27.514 --> 00:36:27.995]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:28.655 --> 00:36:36.358]  These nutraceuticals have really spoiled me because I work out less and was just losing weight.
[00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:38.440]  As long as I took them.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.281]  Then when I quit taking them, I've gained some weight.
[00:36:40.321 --> 00:36:41.642]  So we're going to see what happens.
[00:36:41.702 --> 00:36:43.183]  But I've experienced this.
[00:36:43.203 --> 00:36:45.384]  You need to experience this for yourself.
[00:36:45.505 --> 00:36:46.425]  It's December 5, 2016.
[00:36:46.545 --> 00:36:50.148]  We're only like 25 days from 2017.
[00:36:51.129 --> 00:37:00.836]  And I want to invite all of the InfoWarriors of every race, color, and creed that bleed red blood and love liberty, justice, and truth to make our bodies great again.
[00:37:07.614 --> 00:37:12.777]  Sheriff Joe Arpaio is dropping a bombshell on December 15th.
[00:37:12.857 --> 00:37:22.862]  He's going to have a big press conference presenting criminal evidence of fraud and a forged document which is a federal offense and this will not be about
[00:37:23.602 --> 00:37:25.283]  Where Obama was born.
[00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:30.046]  No, this is going to be about who Obama's real father is.
[00:37:30.506 --> 00:37:32.267]  And we're joined again by Joel Gilbert.
[00:37:32.367 --> 00:37:36.250]  He is the writer and director of Dreams From My Real Father.
[00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:41.393]  And we were just talking about how the birth certificate, you know, I talked to Mike Zullo.
[00:37:41.433 --> 00:37:45.896]  We had a couple beers here locally one night and he told me that this forged document
[00:37:46.556 --> 00:37:48.497]  Was it even a sloppy job?
[00:37:48.517 --> 00:37:50.479]  It wasn't even a good forgery at that.
[00:37:50.879 --> 00:37:52.440]  And he said it was an amateur job.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.721]  Yeah, I've examined it.
[00:37:54.281 --> 00:37:55.662]  It is a terrible forgery.
[00:37:55.802 --> 00:38:03.307]  I mean, I think if you're President of the United States, you can't put an ad on Craigslist saying, could I please have a document forged or create a birth certificate.
[00:38:03.727 --> 00:38:08.430]  You have to rely on someone very close to you who would probably lie in court and
[00:38:09.591 --> 00:38:12.274]  You know, make sure that that information never gets out.
[00:38:12.314 --> 00:38:17.780]  So I think he was stuck with a very primitive document forgery, because it really is a bad forgery.
[00:38:18.161 --> 00:38:28.072]  I've released two birth certificates today with InfoWars that show you can just obviously see the difference between a very poor forgery and authentic Hawaiian birth certificates from 1961.
[00:38:29.093 --> 00:38:37.498]  Well, this has been like the plague for the mainstream media as far as nobody will touch this story outside of alternative media.
[00:38:37.798 --> 00:38:40.759]  That's another reason why they label us fake news.
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:47.583]  Why the big cover-up and why both sides, why the right and left, how come they are both in on this?
[00:38:48.023 --> 00:38:52.546]  I've even heard Bill O'Reilly talk about, look, look, we know the birth certificate is authentic.
[00:38:52.946 --> 00:38:54.127]  Nothing to see here.
[00:38:54.887 --> 00:38:55.768]  So what's the deal?
[00:38:56.209 --> 00:39:07.321]  Uh, well, just to back up one second, you had people that took this to Congress and people in Congress and they said, look, we know this document is very problematic, but we don't want to mess with it.
[00:39:07.361 --> 00:39:08.142]  Take it to the courts.
[00:39:08.702 --> 00:39:09.543]  People went to the courts.
[00:39:09.583 --> 00:39:11.465]  They said, I'm sorry, this is an electoral matter.
[00:39:11.505 --> 00:39:12.346]  Take it to Congress.
[00:39:12.507 --> 00:39:12.767]  Okay.
[00:39:13.127 --> 00:39:15.770]  Uh... then you had the media who was afraid to touch it.
[00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:22.759]  I think the conservative media was afraid to touch it for being accused of being racist for questioning Obama's citizenship.
[00:39:22.819 --> 00:39:25.242]  In fact, no one really ever questioned Obama's citizenship.
[00:39:26.043 --> 00:39:30.949]  It was the authenticity of a document that would reveal that his
[00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:33.971]  Family background might not be what he says.
[00:39:34.171 --> 00:39:50.418]  I think I showed that rather than this very wonderful family background he presented in his life story, Obama had a deeply disturbing family background with a father who was a Soviet agent and radical communist who radicalized him in his youth.
[00:39:53.072 --> 00:39:53.232]  I don't
[00:40:12.583 --> 00:40:17.228]  People have been afraid to stand up, whether it's Obamacare or just about anything else.
[00:40:17.428 --> 00:40:28.500]  They have this fear of confronting Obama with the truth, asking simple questions that researchers have been trying to ask, and the media and the left very cleverly
[00:40:29.201 --> 00:40:34.446]  Turned the question, you know, can you please release your college records, Senate records, birth certificate?
[00:40:34.466 --> 00:40:36.067]  They turned it into a weapon.
[00:40:37.308 --> 00:40:42.653]  You know, if you ask a question, you believe in a religion called birtherism.
[00:40:43.413 --> 00:40:50.239]  And this is just another piece of evidence that the media has died and no longer serves any purpose.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:55.323]  Well, I want to hear more about his childhood and when he was a young adult, and I want to hear more about the
[00:40:56.044 --> 00:40:59.425]  The Hubba Hubba Strip Club and Honey Harlow.
[00:40:59.745 --> 00:41:06.046]  And do you think that she's the famous stripper who allegedly appeared with Obama's mom in those nude photos?
[00:41:06.347 --> 00:41:06.527]  Right.
[00:41:06.587 --> 00:41:10.708]  We obtained a lot of nude photos that show Ann Dunham at Frank Marshall Davis' house.
[00:41:10.768 --> 00:41:16.889]  I went to his house for the purpose of showing that there's a good chance of a relationship between Davis and Obama's mother.
[00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:22.710]  And one of the four strippers in the photos I think is very clearly Honey Harlow.
[00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:24.491]  Honey Harlow was a very famous stripper.
[00:41:25.091 --> 00:41:51.090]  in the fifties an actress ex-wife of Lenny Bruce the famous comedian and uh... she lived in Honolulu all those years and I think that's clearly her in the photo I've released today along with a picture of her at Hubba Hubba uh... Keith Kakagawa told me the stories about how Frank Marshall Davis would take Obama down to Hubba Hubba where Honey Harlow was the manager uh... and uh... by the way I forgot to mention the other interview that uh... Obama's grandfather
[00:41:51.670 --> 00:42:01.796]  Stanley was the insurance agent and he said that he was also the insurance agent for Hubba Hubba and that he would get about a 10% kickback that would go to Frank.
[00:42:02.637 --> 00:42:09.361]  So it was a very intimate and nefarious relationship between all these people for many, many years.
[00:42:10.101 --> 00:42:18.907]  And it just shows how very different the reality is of Obama's upbringing as compared to the glossy picture he painted for us.
[00:42:19.367 --> 00:42:22.330]  It almost reminds me of a Manchurian candidate.
[00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:25.132]  We call him the Ghost President, Manchurian Candidate President.
[00:42:25.192 --> 00:42:27.794]  It's a little bit of a stretch, but he's not who he says he is.
[00:42:27.814 --> 00:42:29.295]  I call him the Radical-in-Chief.
[00:42:29.635 --> 00:42:30.136]  There you go.
[00:42:30.176 --> 00:42:31.016]  That's a good description.
[00:42:31.437 --> 00:42:47.569]  Now, every once in a while, we've seen Obama in either press conferences or television interviews where he slips up and he mentions some revealing truth of his past, and you discovered an interview where he talks about how he studied overseas.
[00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:48.210]  Tell us about that.
[00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.710]  Correct.
[00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:52.731]  Well, I had suspected that Obama was not at Columbia for two years.
[00:42:52.771 --> 00:42:55.151]  He claimed he was at Occidental and transferred to Columbia.
[00:42:55.191 --> 00:42:56.332]  And we can't see the records.
[00:42:56.492 --> 00:42:57.292]  Yeah, no records.
[00:42:57.312 --> 00:42:58.872]  There's no such thing as a transfer program.
[00:42:58.912 --> 00:42:59.973]  He said he was in a transfer program.
[00:43:00.353 --> 00:43:06.594]  Columbia University, I spoke to Henry Graff, 95 years old, was the head of the political science department at Columbia.
[00:43:06.994 --> 00:43:11.295]  And he said, look, Obama was not in any of my classes and in none of my colleagues' classes.
[00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:14.736]  How do you graduate from Columbia in political science if you never go to class?
[00:43:14.756 --> 00:43:15.316]  That's what he told me.
[00:43:16.016 --> 00:43:19.538]  So it was clear that Obama was not there, certainly not for two years.
[00:43:20.038 --> 00:43:25.641]  I discovered that in his senior year he took freshman courses, which showed that he was just filling out some requirements.
[00:43:26.322 --> 00:43:36.287]  And I gained a tremendous amount of evidence that showed that Obama, who was an international studies major at Occidental, went on a junior year abroad and lived in Pakistan for his junior year.
[00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:43.731]  Now Peter Geithner, the father of Secretary of Treasury Peter Geithner, I'm sorry, Timothy Geithner,
[00:43:45.692 --> 00:43:54.163]  Peter Geithner was the head of the Foreign Foundation in Asia, lived in Hong Kong, and Anne Dunham, Obama's mother, worked for Peter Geithner those years.
[00:43:54.183 --> 00:44:01.071]  So I spoke to Peter Geithner about two years ago, and he told me that Obama had a scholarship from the Ford Foundation to go to Colombia.
[00:44:01.946 --> 00:44:02.786]  In his senior year.
[00:44:03.386 --> 00:44:10.989]  So with that bit of information, you put together all the pieces and I'm certain that Obama was abroad.
[00:44:11.069 --> 00:44:15.670]  His mother also lived in Pakistan during that year and he slipped up when he spoke to Good Morning America.
[00:44:15.871 --> 00:44:23.033]  Are you concerned that your lack of experience when it comes to foreign policy may hurt your chances in the run for the White House?
[00:44:24.248 --> 00:44:29.550]  Well, actually, my experience in foreign policy is probably more diverse than most others in the field.
[00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:35.072]  I mean, I'm somebody who has actually lived overseas, somebody who has studied overseas.
[00:44:36.132 --> 00:44:37.732]  I majored in international relations.
[00:44:38.333 --> 00:44:45.035]  Okay, so in that clip to Good Morning America, Obama said, I lived abroad and studied abroad, and that's why I know so much about international relations.
[00:44:45.595 --> 00:44:50.857]  Well, he certainly wasn't talking about being a four-year-old going to kindergarten in Indonesia.
[00:44:50.877 --> 00:44:52.678]  I don't think they'd studied that.
[00:44:53.218 --> 00:45:00.140]  No, that terminology is the terminology that junior year abroad students use, that type of terminology.
[00:45:00.601 --> 00:45:01.201]  He slipped up.
[00:45:01.381 --> 00:45:02.861]  And he just kind of slipped up.
[00:45:02.961 --> 00:45:12.105]  So his affinity, this explains Obama's cultural affinity and political affinity with Islam and the Islamic world, living as an adult in a Muslim country.
[00:45:12.625 --> 00:45:21.692]  That's why he went to Egypt and used all that terminology in his first speech in Cairo about how, as President of the United States, his job is to defend Islam.
[00:45:22.093 --> 00:45:24.655]  Talking about the Quran, the Holy Quran.
[00:45:25.175 --> 00:45:29.438]  All this terminology and knowledge was not the knowledge of a four-year-old.
[00:45:29.518 --> 00:45:33.762]  It was the knowledge of someone who spent a year of his adult life living in a Muslim country.
[00:45:34.082 --> 00:45:41.392]  Well, absolutely, and what gets me is we were talking earlier about the mainstream media being very critical of Donald Trump for getting his...
[00:45:43.357 --> 00:45:51.501]  News and even as intelligence reports is how they phrase it from InfoWars and when we talk about Things like the birth certificate.
[00:45:51.881 --> 00:46:08.148]  We just didn't make up this Conspiracy theory no we went we sent our reporters to a press conference in 2012 from Sheriff Joe Arpaio and his cold-case posse these this was a team of investigators And this is what these guys do they investigate forgeries they investigate
[00:46:08.148 --> 00:46:08.508]  We're good.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:28.842]  Look, the birth certificate is one small piece of the puzzle, which explains why Barack Obama had a radical presidency.
[00:46:29.562 --> 00:46:37.384]  Open the borders, diminish American power abroad, abandon our allies, force government-controlled health care upon the United States.
[00:46:38.225 --> 00:46:43.186]  Obama learned in Chicago from his mentor Bill Ayers, the terrorist emeritus from the Weather Underground,
[00:46:44.367 --> 00:46:46.229]  He learned that you don't tell the truth.
[00:46:46.349 --> 00:46:49.573]  You look people in the eye and tell them you want to help working families.
[00:46:49.913 --> 00:46:55.099]  And when you get into office, you throw the electorate under the bus and pursue the agenda that no one voted for.
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.442]  And that's what happened to America the past eight years.
[00:47:03.024 --> 00:47:11.171]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:20.958]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.379 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.302 --> 00:47:28.304]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.324 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.
[00:47:53.493 --> 00:47:54.533]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.

[00:48:59.629 --> 00:49:02.331]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:08.455 --> 00:49:09.896]  It is a big idea.
[00:49:10.997 --> 00:49:12.018]  A new world order.
[00:49:16.385 --> 00:49:20.948]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:49:22.589 --> 00:49:23.209]  What's wrong?
[00:49:23.289 --> 00:49:24.470]  Nothing, nothing really.
[00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:28.212]  I just feel that I need something stronger.
[00:49:28.292 --> 00:49:31.614]  If you have a problem, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.
[00:49:31.714 --> 00:49:33.515]  Stay calm.
[00:49:34.015 --> 00:49:40.119]  For more enjoyment and greater efficiency, consumption is being standardized.
[00:49:41.796 --> 00:49:48.842]  If you feel you are not properly sedated, call 348-844-IMMEDIATELY.
[00:49:49.482 --> 00:49:55.006]  Failure to do so may result in prosecution for criminal drug evasion.
[00:50:10.356 --> 00:50:12.438]  I've really got to hand it to the globalists.
[00:50:13.138 --> 00:50:14.479]  They have stuck to their plan.
[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:34.554]  If you go back to the mid-1850s, British scientists, in fact, leading scientists of the day, like Galton, and of course Wedgwood, Huxley, Darwin, envisioned a planned world controlled by a scientific elite.
[00:50:35.034 --> 00:50:38.277]  Malthus, more than a hundred years before them, had also developed a similar plan.
[00:50:39.326 --> 00:50:42.293]  And they have been developing it and refining it ever since.
[00:50:42.894 --> 00:50:45.720]  And you can read the books that they wrote about their plan.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:51:09.776]  Galton envisioned computers and the double helix of DNA and the science of biometrics and developed the system of eugenics based off Plato's writings from thousands of years before to set up a planned technocracy to control every facet of human life carried out by a very tiny scientific elite on top.
[00:51:10.416 --> 00:51:25.204]  And the British Empire by the 1850s was the dominant force in the world, and they needed systems or sciences of population control, so they put the equivalent of trillions of dollars today into funding these sciences.
[00:51:25.924 --> 00:51:36.250]  And though these sciences were anti-human in many ways, you have to give them credit that many of the modern sciences we enjoy today were developed through their labors.
[00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:45.494]  Ten years ago, I produced a documentary film that tens of millions of people watched online, and it was a big success in stores around the country.
[00:51:45.814 --> 00:51:50.116]  So it was well-received, titled, in-game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:51:51.897 --> 00:51:57.179]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.921]  Once free nations are slaves to the will of a tiny elite.
[00:52:03.222 --> 00:52:05.923]  The dawn of a new dark age is upon mankind.
[00:52:06.872 --> 00:52:22.327]  But folks thought that it was like a science fiction dystopia film even though it was real quotes and real video of world leaders in the last 80 years calling for an authoritarian science-based global dictatorship.
[00:52:23.442 --> 00:52:35.726]  Fast forward to late 2016, and much of what we put in the film and predicted as near future developments has already happened, and the rest of it is now being publicly announced.
[00:52:36.446 --> 00:52:38.867]  A lot of people ask me, Alex, how did you know all of this?
[00:52:38.927 --> 00:52:39.627]  Are you psychic?
[00:52:40.247 --> 00:52:42.928]  And I explain to them again, have you watched the film?
[00:52:43.488 --> 00:52:46.369]  It's video clips, it's film clips, it's newsreels.
[00:52:47.069 --> 00:52:48.350]  Going back to the 20s and 30s,
[00:52:50.029 --> 00:52:52.572]  Where they were admitting all of this.
[00:52:53.373 --> 00:53:07.169]  Pre-Hitler, eugenics and this new science-based control of human procreation, compact cities, you name it, was accepted by the public because they believed anything scientific must be good.
[00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:24.746]  Hitler's plan for living space and the final solution admittedly came out of the Cold Springs Harbor Rockefeller Foundation program in New York and was transferred in the 30s to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and was the map for the Nazis.
[00:53:25.747 --> 00:53:32.854]  IBM's Thomas Watson and thousands of IBM engineers ran the Nazi war machine and the Holocaust.
[00:53:34.187 --> 00:53:53.886]  And to understand the system we're going into, it's important to listen to Aldous Huxley, whose brother ran the United Nations and the UNESCO program for three decades and is the father of the transhumanist program and the former head of the World Eugenics Society, Julian Huxley.
[00:53:54.526 --> 00:53:55.647]  Both men wrote books.
[00:53:56.588 --> 00:53:57.088]  Compare!
[00:54:18.675 --> 00:54:28.082]  The Parable of Brave New World with another parable which was put forth more recently in George Orwell's book 1984.
[00:54:28.242 --> 00:54:40.251]  I'm inclined to think that the scientific dictatorships of the future, and I think they're going to be scientific dictatorships in many parts of the world,
[00:54:41.204 --> 00:54:49.747]  We'll be probably a good deal nearer to the Brave New World pattern than to the 1984 pattern.
[00:54:49.787 --> 00:55:02.052]  They will be a good deal nearer, not because of any humanitarian qualms in the scientific dictators, but simply because the Brave New World pattern is probably a good deal more efficient than the other.
[00:55:02.652 --> 00:55:03.553]  But if you can
[00:55:04.361 --> 00:55:10.922]  I get people to consent to the state of affairs in which they are living, the state of servitude, the state of being.
[00:55:11.482 --> 00:55:30.086]  Well, it seems to me that the nature of the ultimate revolution with which we are now faced is precisely this, that we are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy,
[00:55:31.244 --> 00:55:41.307]  ...have always existed, and presumably always will exist, to get people actually to love their servitude.
[00:55:41.847 --> 00:55:50.770]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[00:55:51.559 --> 00:56:06.093]  And these methods, I think, are a real refinement on the older methods of terror, because they combine methods of terror with methods of acceptance.
[00:56:06.593 --> 00:56:16.302]  Then he said, by the year 2000, it will be evident that this was not fiction, and actually a fictionalized account of what we're actually intending to build.
[00:56:17.023 --> 00:56:24.947]  Now that we've broken down a brief history of this scientific system of control, let's look at the latest huge developments.
[00:56:25.628 --> 00:56:37.134]  Gentlemen, for the gentlemen out there who are not yet married, let me just explain to you, your goal is to improve your gene pool by marrying somebody who is superior to you.
[00:56:39.938 --> 00:56:54.244]  Shortly after my film came out in 2007, Barack Obama got into office, and all of a sudden, the eugenics program and the technocracy program, not just here in the U.S., but globally, went from being secret
[00:56:55.194 --> 00:57:01.317]  Or restricted, and not for public promotion, to suddenly being pushed everywhere.
[00:57:01.597 --> 00:57:22.327]  There were shows about the world after humans, how great it'll be, and how horrible humans are, and New York Times bestsellers about how a wonderful plague would come and kill everybody, and how humans are parasites, and professors were lauded and praised who gave speeches about airborne Ebola killing 90% of the population, and how 12 monkeys needs to become a reality.
[00:57:23.559 --> 00:57:32.143]  Suddenly, Ray Kurzweil said, we'll soon merge the machines, everyone else will be like cockroaches, you'll assimilate by the Borg, or you will be basically destroyed.
[00:57:32.824 --> 00:57:48.752]  And now, they have MIT Magazine, they have the Davos Group, they have, almost on a daily basis, Wired Magazine, all the modern intelligentsia groups, who went from saying, I was insane, and none of this existed, and it was fake news, and it was made up, and it was conspiracy theory,
[00:57:49.741 --> 00:57:53.802]  To rolling it out because they're so close to their program being completed.
[00:57:54.162 --> 00:58:04.205]  There was an article today on InfoWars.com by Michael Snyder, proof that the elite really do want a global society with no possessions, no privacy, and no freedom.
[00:58:04.786 --> 00:58:10.147]  If they get their way, our world is going to look vastly different than it does now in the not too distant future.
[00:58:10.287 --> 00:58:17.169]  And there are scores of links in his article and quotes by world leaders currently saying this.
[00:58:17.570 --> 00:58:18.570]  The first link
[00:58:19.625 --> 00:58:31.513]  goes to an article that came out in November of this year, just a month ago, at the World Economic Forum that is basically the mouthpiece of the private Bilderberg Group and secretive club of Rome.
[00:58:32.033 --> 00:58:38.417]  The very same members attend this and they want a $100 trillion global tax every decade that's paid out every year.
[00:58:39.137 --> 00:58:41.879]  They want the state running your family.
[00:58:41.979 --> 00:58:42.740]  They admit it all.
[00:58:43.936 --> 00:58:46.217]  All right, folks, that's going to do it for tonight's broadcast.
[00:58:46.297 --> 00:58:50.839]  InfoWars Nightly News will return, Lord willing, tomorrow evening at 7 o'clock p.m.
[00:58:50.939 --> 00:58:51.359]  Central.

[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.932]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.393 --> 00:59:20.121]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.442 --> 00:59:24.185]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.746 --> 00:59:27.588]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:36.017]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.317 --> 00:59:38.620]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
