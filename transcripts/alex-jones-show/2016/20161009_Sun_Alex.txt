[00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:39.557]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:40.058 --> 00:00:45.203]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:47.025 --> 00:00:54.029]  We all know the FBI, about a month and a half ago, gave immunity to everybody that had covered up Hillary Clinton with her criminal activities.
[00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:55.630]  Selling U.S.
[00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.991]  secrets, selling out U.S.
[00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:58.792]  sovereignties, selling out favors.
[00:00:59.512 --> 00:01:02.274]  Everybody from the Saudi Arabians, to the communist Chinese, to the Russians.
[00:01:03.174 --> 00:01:09.158]  And so what does Hillary do, is she has a massive problem selling out for $35 million, one-fifth of U.S.
[00:01:09.198 --> 00:01:10.278]  weapons-grade plutonium.
[00:01:10.318 --> 00:01:13.240]  That's admitted, that's in the Wall Street Journal, that's even in the New York Times.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.161]  She accuses
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.240]  Donald Trump of being a Russian agent.
[00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:18.821]  They've accused me of that.
[00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:20.041]  I mean, this is really getting crazy.
[00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:23.662]  It's like accusing me of being Santa Claus or a keyboard elf.
[00:01:24.622 --> 00:01:40.005]  Well, what do you do when you've got the same FBI a couple years ago with Jeffrey Epstein, who had the Lolita Express with Bill Clinton on at least 16 round-trip flights to the pedophile island that he got convicted of running?
[00:01:42.162 --> 00:01:48.006]  And then you've got Clinton flying out to hang out with Sultans that have admitted harems of little boys and little girls.
[00:01:48.306 --> 00:01:49.486]  This is mainstream news.
[00:01:49.927 --> 00:01:51.708]  Well, the FBI, quote, gave them all immunity.
[00:01:52.348 --> 00:01:53.729]  Magic wand, you're above the law.
[00:01:54.269 --> 00:01:55.930]  But they know Trump is holding this back.
[00:01:56.891 --> 00:02:00.373]  I've known this has been a Trump-October surprise for six months.
[00:02:02.494 --> 00:02:03.435]  And so what happens?
[00:02:04.756 --> 00:02:05.916]  They hit Trump with it.
[00:02:07.237 --> 00:02:11.520]  Now, in 30 minutes, I'm going to break down an internal Democratic Party dossier.
[00:02:13.493 --> 00:02:21.877]  And we have the actual next 29 days till the election, the actual data dump on their battle plans and how they're going to hit Trump.
[00:02:21.917 --> 00:02:30.361]  We even know what she and Anderson Cooper are going to be hitting them first with in the debate at 8 o'clock Central, 9 o'clock Eastern tonight.
[00:02:31.581 --> 00:02:35.203]  So that is all coming up today.
[00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:39.185]  At the bottom of the hour, I will break all of this down.
[00:02:41.018 --> 00:02:42.018]  This is so surreal.
[00:02:42.778 --> 00:02:50.080]  Now, obviously, they've released an 11-year-old tape of him on a TV show, and they were deceptively recording him on a bus.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.760]  It's highly edited.
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.121]  You hear him kind of end with, well, she was married, so I, you know, backed off.
[00:02:57.121 --> 00:02:57.981]  Locker room talk.
[00:02:58.722 --> 00:03:01.042]  I guarantee you, most Republicans and Democrats do far worse.
[00:03:01.382 --> 00:03:04.263]  But my issue is Trump never acted like he was some perfect angel.
[00:03:04.303 --> 00:03:05.263]  He never held that out.
[00:03:07.671 --> 00:03:09.052]  He's got the same sin as King David.
[00:03:09.072 --> 00:03:10.253]  He likes women or King Solomon.
[00:03:11.034 --> 00:03:12.315]  The point is he's a nationalist.
[00:03:12.335 --> 00:03:18.700]  He's got the globalists that have occupied and captured this country absolutely hating his guts and throwing everything they've got at him.
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.963]  It's not like he was some televangelist that said if you kiss your girlfriend out of wedlock you're going to hell.
[00:03:22.983 --> 00:03:25.625]  And then he got caught, you know, with a prostitute.
[00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:27.406]  The guy's never been a hypocrite.
[00:03:27.827 --> 00:03:28.727]  We knew this was all coming up.
[00:03:28.767 --> 00:03:30.048]  Those Howard Stern interviews are old.
[00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:31.830]  They hit him with those a year ago.
[00:03:34.645 --> 00:03:38.788]  So, this is all about manipulating his evangelical support base.
[00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:43.011]  What you need to know is, Pence is anti-abortion, so is Trump.
[00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:44.251]  That's all you need to know.
[00:03:44.552 --> 00:03:45.292]  Is the guy a hypocrite?
[00:03:45.332 --> 00:03:45.852]  Absolutely not.
[00:03:46.273 --> 00:03:53.738]  If he was a goody two-shoe, and said that he was the cleanest whistle around, and then he got caught shooting his mouth off like this, I'd say this guy's a hypocrite.
[00:03:53.758 --> 00:03:54.158]  I don't like him.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.681]  Quite frankly, I like Trump more because of this.
[00:03:58.761 --> 00:04:02.904]  And it's not that I'm some gruff guy that shoots my mouth off like this.
[00:04:04.147 --> 00:04:06.472]  It's that it's so real, that's why they're so scared of him.
[00:04:08.236 --> 00:04:09.298]  And they cannot stand him.
[00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:14.389]  And they've got more of this stuff coming out, but man, the Clintons literally fund radical jihadis.
[00:04:15.162 --> 00:04:16.782]  That mutilate women's genitals.
[00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:22.304]  Hillary stays in the same bedroom with Uma Abedin, whose mother is the top genital mutilation maven that pushes it.
[00:04:22.724 --> 00:04:25.024]  They fund jihadis to take over, kill hundreds of thousands of Christians.
[00:04:25.725 --> 00:04:27.065]  Benghazi, what difference does it make?
[00:04:27.085 --> 00:04:29.165]  You know, the ordering the stand down, getting caught lying about it.
[00:04:29.806 --> 00:04:31.226]  It goes on and on and on.
[00:04:31.246 --> 00:04:35.567]  The abortion pushing they're doing, the baby parts selling that Trump says is horrible.
[00:04:36.087 --> 00:04:38.868]  So, killing 3-4 million babies, selling their body parts a year?
[00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:40.088]  That bad?
[00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.809]  No.
[00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.112]  The average fake Christian wants to bitch about him saying, oh my goodness, this woman was so hot until she was married.
[00:04:46.893 --> 00:04:53.117]  This is really a referendum on whether we really want to be with the establishment that's screwing us over or we want to make America great again.
[00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:55.238]  All right, it's a big broadcast.
[00:04:55.299 --> 00:04:56.759]  We've got huge breaking news.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.761]  I've got my Democratic Party source.
[00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:00.442]  Roger Stone's going to be joining us.
[00:05:00.462 --> 00:05:01.983]  He's got huge intel on the debate.
[00:05:02.403 --> 00:05:04.525]  This is going to be a big broadcast, one of the biggest ever.
[00:05:04.825 --> 00:05:05.285]  Stay with us.
[00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:09.368]  We're two hours out from our expanded coverage and then four hours.
[00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:12.072]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[00:05:13.695 --> 00:05:19.364]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:23.952]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[00:05:24.915 --> 00:05:27.137]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[00:05:27.217 --> 00:05:28.359]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:31.622]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[00:05:32.603 --> 00:05:32.943]  Or more.
[00:05:33.023 --> 00:05:35.005]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[00:05:35.446 --> 00:05:36.927]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[00:05:37.047 --> 00:05:39.930]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:40.651]  It's actually scary.
[00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:53.237]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[00:05:54.217 --> 00:06:07.022]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:25.456]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:43.624 --> 00:06:47.827]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, October 9th, 2016.
[00:06:47.867 --> 00:06:53.131]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you live from the heart of Texas, Austin, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:58.214]  Well, coming up tonight, we've got the CNN Hosted Debate with Anderson Cooper, half of its town hall.
[00:06:59.515 --> 00:07:07.721]  We have intelligence from inside the Democratic Party, high level, on the dossier that they intend to attack Donald Trump with the next 29 days.
[00:07:10.046 --> 00:07:17.071]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I will launch into this exclusive battle plan that the Democrats have to launch.
[00:07:18.312 --> 00:07:20.774]  Now obviously, it's going to be about sexual activity.
[00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:23.015]  They know that's Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton's weakness.
[00:07:23.756 --> 00:07:30.541]  They want to muddy the waters and accuse Trump of what they clearly have been involved in and have been involved covering up.
[00:07:31.762 --> 00:07:35.825]  Trump made a major miscalculation through intermediaries from the Clintons.
[00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:45.345]  Threw Chelsea to Trump's daughters two and a half weeks ago, in the upcoming debate a week later, to not go after Hillary for the sexual crimes.
[00:07:45.906 --> 00:07:53.833]  And covering up, and staying in the same hotel room with Umad Abedin, whose mother's the top jihadi Wahhabist Sharia law pusher for sexual mutilation.
[00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:54.934]  I mean, she's the top person.
[00:07:55.595 --> 00:08:01.501]  Made a huge mistake not going after that, because now they are going to hammer him, and hammer him hard.
[00:08:03.462 --> 00:08:12.229]  Now, obviously we have the three-minute tape, highly edited, but Trump just came out and said, well, I apologize, this is 11 years ago, this isn't who I normally am, and I've changed.
[00:08:12.289 --> 00:08:16.292]  And I'm sure he has changed, getting educated about the globalists and the New World Order, he's shown that.
[00:08:16.312 --> 00:08:17.693]  That's why the establishment hates him.
[00:08:19.354 --> 00:08:26.320]  But just to see Bill Clinton, who's settled sexual assault cases, settled all these other cases with women, who's known to do all this,
[00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:33.402]  That the mainstream media ignoring these scores of women that have come out saying he brutally raped them decades ago.
[00:08:34.703 --> 00:08:41.288]  And Hillary on tape bragging about covering up for a pedophile she knew was guilty who brutally raped a 12-year-old girl and put her in a coma.
[00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:49.214]  And then to see them launching jihad attacks and pushing all this and then saying, oh my gosh, Donald Trump,
[00:08:50.526 --> 00:08:56.827]  With some, you know, contestant, twenty years ago, said that she gained too much weight after she won, so she lost her contract.
[00:08:57.208 --> 00:08:59.948]  That's what happens with a boxer, if they're not weight for a fight.
[00:09:00.408 --> 00:09:06.330]  Supposed to be a middleweight, you're in a heavyweight range, you forfeit the fight, or the person's gotta go ahead and fight you and sign off on that.
[00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:11.591]  But, women say they want to be in a man's world, fine, you gotta play by those rules.
[00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:15.612]  So they push this whole thing along sexist lines, it's all Hillary Clinton's got.
[00:09:16.732 --> 00:09:19.054]  Well, she's one of the biggest abusers of women out there.
[00:09:19.074 --> 00:09:25.358]  I mean, this is epic what's going on, and I don't just sit here and approach this like I'm a Republican who wants Trump to win.
[00:09:26.779 --> 00:09:27.920]  Trump has his own issues.
[00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:31.263]  I've been against the Republicans many times in my radio and TV career.
[00:09:31.523 --> 00:09:33.024]  I'm bipartisan when I attack people.
[00:09:33.585 --> 00:09:34.405]  I just go after the truth.
[00:09:34.445 --> 00:09:45.694]  But Hillary is such a monster, and has such a criminal record, and stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders, and on the payroll of the Saudi Arabians and the Communist Chinese,
[00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:51.155]  All these other corrupt governments and the Pope all lined up telling us we can't have Donald Trump.
[00:09:51.195 --> 00:09:51.775]  Why is that?
[00:09:52.655 --> 00:10:04.817]  Because these special interests have taken this country over and Donald Trump, they don't know if he's for real trying to get us our sovereignty back or whether he's just a hyena trying to come in and steal the lion's quarry that they've already killed.
[00:10:05.518 --> 00:10:10.598]  They just know he is part of their club and he's coming in to this kill.
[00:10:11.079 --> 00:10:13.139]  They're about to try to kick him off of the kill.
[00:10:14.284 --> 00:10:16.166]  So, Trump's an unknown country.
[00:10:16.706 --> 00:10:18.267]  Trump's not perfect, we all know that.
[00:10:19.548 --> 00:10:22.391]  But we know Hillary Clinton is pure evil.
[00:10:23.812 --> 00:10:31.699]  And there's this mass mental illness where people can sit there and think that they're buying into somebody so they're getting political power by getting reflected glory from them.
[00:10:31.739 --> 00:10:36.082]  With Hillary, and with Obama, blacks have gotten double unemployment, what they had eight years ago.
[00:10:36.783 --> 00:10:39.845]  With them, the college educations are more unaffordable than ever.
[00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:46.852]  And 80 plus percent of people that get one of these college degrees will never pay off their loan, will never get a job that's worth the degree.
[00:10:48.553 --> 00:10:54.716]  But people that have been defrauded by this system are doubling down believing Bernie Sanders or Hillary can deliver them this.
[00:10:54.756 --> 00:11:02.360]  But when Hillary speaks to Wall Street, she says, listen, Bernie supporters live in their mother's basements, they're baristas at best, they're nobodies or losers.
[00:11:04.101 --> 00:11:07.643]  And she's come out and said that her own people in these emails
[00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:09.480]  Our losers.
[00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:14.006]  And then Obama calls gun owners and Bible believers bitter clingers.
[00:11:14.026 --> 00:11:16.009]  Well, you've already taken everything else we've got.
[00:11:16.029 --> 00:11:21.156]  Obama goes to Africa and says you can't have cars or air conditioning.
[00:11:23.159 --> 00:11:23.320]  So...
[00:11:24.895 --> 00:11:26.176]  That's the latest WikiLeaks, by the way.
[00:11:26.216 --> 00:11:29.777]  That is very weak compared to what was supposedly going to come out, they said, last Monday.
[00:11:29.797 --> 00:11:32.199]  And it was going to, quote, on Tuesday, it was going to devastate Hillary.
[00:11:32.779 --> 00:11:34.840]  She would, quote, you know, be indicted.
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.780]  This would do it.
[00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:43.524]  Now, the latest thing is her at Wall Street speeches talking trash about people and admitting she wants a world government and carbon taxes and the TPP.
[00:11:43.564 --> 00:11:48.066]  Well, we know she called it the gold standard and bragged that she helped do the whole thing.
[00:11:48.106 --> 00:11:52.248]  And she claims, like Al Gore says he invented the Internet, she says she did the whole thing in speeches.
[00:11:52.548 --> 00:11:53.109]  We got video.
[00:11:53.729 --> 00:11:55.609]  So, I mean, what did WikiLeaks give us?
[00:11:55.649 --> 00:11:56.430]  We didn't already know.
[00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:02.331]  I mean, I guess it's internal emails, but there's thousands of them, but folks have already poured through them.
[00:12:02.371 --> 00:12:07.232]  So, the word is the Sons got intimidated, got threatened, and didn't release the motherload, and that's too bad.
[00:12:08.652 --> 00:12:19.554]  Now that they feel safe on this, they are moving forward with their massive, massive destruction of Donald Trump that I will cover at the bottom of the hour.
[00:12:19.574 --> 00:12:20.354]  Now, if you've just tuned in,
[00:12:21.809 --> 00:12:23.610]  I've been hosting radio for 21 years.
[00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:24.830]  I've been syndicated for 19.
[00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.011]  For 10 years, I've been doing a Sunday show.
[00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:29.992]  Because I noticed that nobody really broadcasts on Saturday and Sunday.
[00:12:30.312 --> 00:12:31.293]  Drudge used to, and it was great.
[00:12:31.313 --> 00:12:32.133]  You used to always listen to it.
[00:12:32.793 --> 00:12:36.595]  And I thought, to fill that vacuum, we should syndicate on Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:12:36.615 --> 00:12:36.975]  We've done that.
[00:12:36.995 --> 00:12:37.795]  It's been very successful.
[00:12:37.815 --> 00:12:41.157]  In fact, it was key to getting on a lot of big stations across the country.
[00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:43.918]  There's a lot of folks who stick their toe in the water, pick up the Sunday show.
[00:12:43.938 --> 00:12:45.138]  The listeners liked it, got ratings.
[00:12:45.499 --> 00:12:47.339]  See it won to the end of the world, you picked Alex Jones up.
[00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:49.980]  Then they'd put us on at night, then they'd put us on live.
[00:12:50.761 --> 00:12:51.361]  It's been a success.
[00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:54.072]  We've got to jump on the news for the week.
[00:12:54.652 --> 00:13:03.635]  But today, when your station leaves us at 6 o'clock Central, 7 o'clock Eastern, 5 o'clock Mountain, 4 o'clock Pacific, we will continue on.
[00:13:03.655 --> 00:13:05.936]  And some stations are carrying it, TV stations are carrying it.
[00:13:06.436 --> 00:13:07.337]  Everybody's free to air.
[00:13:08.277 --> 00:13:09.418]  Take part of it, take all of it.
[00:13:09.478 --> 00:13:10.298]  No contract needed.
[00:13:10.358 --> 00:13:11.678]  Just pick it up if you want it, stations.
[00:13:11.718 --> 00:13:12.119]  You know that.
[00:13:12.479 --> 00:13:15.120]  We're just here to win this war against the globalists and wake up America.
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:20.422]  But if you go to InfoWars.com forward slash show or InfoWars.com forward slash app,
[00:13:21.596 --> 00:13:26.838]  You can download the new free app on Droid and iPhone that has video, audio, news alerts that are going to start in two weeks.
[00:13:26.858 --> 00:13:28.559]  A lot of other new stuff is going to be added to the app.
[00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:29.299]  It's a great new app.
[00:13:29.319 --> 00:13:44.765]  You can also watch the debate there because when this two hours ends, that we've been doing for ten years, two hours of further live coverage from our big TV studios, I'm going to walk across the hall as soon as this show's over, and then the full coverage for at least four hours of the debate begins.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:53.864]  Two hours from six to eight central, the 90-minute debate, and at least an hour of live coverage and highlights with Leigh Ann McAdoo, David Knight, myself, and others.
[00:13:54.845 --> 00:13:55.345]  That's coming up.
[00:13:55.365 --> 00:14:05.530]  So we'll probably be live until like 11 o'clock, so I'll say six, seven hours, as long as we want to go tonight, InfoWars.com forward slash show, InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:14:06.851 --> 00:14:07.732]  But if you just tuned in,
[00:14:08.752 --> 00:14:12.034]  We have the leaked Democrats' plan to pin rape hoax on Trump.
[00:14:12.074 --> 00:14:13.775]  Now, people are saying, yeah, what was it?
[00:14:14.315 --> 00:14:20.659]  Eight, nine months ago, there were rape charges filed in a civil suit in Houston with a fake name.
[00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:22.780]  And then others got filed all over.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.281]  People ask, what's the point of filing these fake things?
[00:14:26.342 --> 00:14:30.724]  Because then it gives people cover to write books and articles saying, oh, we didn't know.
[00:14:31.064 --> 00:14:31.985]  It's in a lawsuit.
[00:14:32.485 --> 00:14:37.388]  You can say Jane Doe and then claim you saw Trump raping Easter bunnies on Pluto.
[00:14:38.541 --> 00:14:39.362]  And then write a book about it.
[00:14:40.242 --> 00:14:43.905]  And then, again, they didn't launch this earlier because there's only 29 days left.
[00:14:43.945 --> 00:14:44.986]  They're going to launch this tomorrow.
[00:14:45.186 --> 00:14:45.466]  Watch.
[00:14:46.888 --> 00:14:47.688]  We have the dossier.
[00:14:47.948 --> 00:14:49.269]  They may change it up because of this.
[00:14:51.091 --> 00:14:57.796]  And by the way, when we got this info yesterday, we started getting it two days ago, all hell broke loose.
[00:14:57.856 --> 00:14:58.577]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:14:58.597 --> 00:14:59.378]  I mean, they are freaked.
[00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:00.959]  This is not where we were given this info.
[00:15:01.459 --> 00:15:05.082]  If they don't run with this tomorrow, it's because we have released this.
[00:15:05.142 --> 00:15:06.123]  But they're going to go with it.
[00:15:07.128 --> 00:15:11.089]  They've got a book being published they're going to announce tomorrow that comes out Tuesday.
[00:15:11.609 --> 00:15:13.049]  They've got articles that are all about to hit.
[00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:19.750]  In fact, I heard about this on Friday, got the documents Saturday, and by then it began to even kind of break as they tested the waters.
[00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.051]  So, this is big.
[00:15:23.351 --> 00:15:30.592]  They are accusing Trump of what Jeffrey Epstein was involved with with Bill Clinton and the Lolita Express.
[00:15:31.753 --> 00:15:33.193]  Trump on record has been to one
[00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:39.774]  Florida party that this guy was at and left immediately, a couple years ago.
[00:15:41.396 --> 00:15:47.262]  Bill Clinton's registered in flight 16 times Alita Express with Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:15:47.282 --> 00:15:51.606]  So they know Trump had, this is his October surprise, hydrogen bomb.
[00:15:52.607 --> 00:15:54.449]  Trump was induced not to drop it.
[00:15:55.287 --> 00:15:56.548]  He didn't launch the attack.
[00:15:57.349 --> 00:15:58.890]  The enemy's launching a counterfeit.
[00:15:59.731 --> 00:16:06.718]  And they're mixing it all in with a few Howard Stern comments in this other tape, edited to give it plausible believability.
[00:16:07.058 --> 00:16:07.439]  Stay with us.
[00:16:09.082 --> 00:16:27.533]  Ladies and gentlemen, this Sunday is the biggest presidential debate in United States history, and Infowars.com slash show will have complete coverage for you, starting at four o'clock central with the Alex Jones Show, and then rolling right through the entire debate, even afterwards taking your phone calls.
[00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:29.354]  Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump
[00:16:29.694 --> 00:16:30.994]  Round two from St.
[00:16:31.034 --> 00:16:33.115]  Louis, Missouri, Washington University.
[00:16:33.335 --> 00:16:43.538]  This is the most anticipated debate ever and we're going to have complete coverage for you at InfoWars.com and also the new InfoWars live app.
[00:16:43.738 --> 00:16:53.441]  We're going to have boots on the ground and we're going to have the entire InfoWars crew in studio covering the debate, breaking down the things that the two candidates say in live time.
[00:16:53.761 --> 00:16:55.805]  Are you going to be stuck at home watching football?
[00:16:55.825 --> 00:16:58.169]  Or are you going to be engaged in the InfoWar?
[00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:06.845]  InfoWars.com slash show, InfoWars live app, complete coverage of the presidential debate, round two, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
[00:17:11.806 --> 00:17:16.770]  Now another shirt that was designed and licensed from Roger Stone is the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[00:17:17.431 --> 00:17:20.113]  Looks like the, you know, communist style Obama Hope shirt.
[00:17:20.814 --> 00:17:26.839]  But says, rape, wear it, get aggressive, start the conversations, get on TV with it.
[00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:27.860]  In fact, I'm going to say this right now.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:38.469]  Anyone that gets on national TV with the shirt, clearly, for more than five seconds, gets a thousand dollars.
[00:17:40.066 --> 00:17:41.648]  That means, you know, behind cameras, you name it.
[00:17:41.809 --> 00:17:51.722]  Anyone that gets it on air on national TV and gets the words out, Bill Clinton is a rapist, are things along that line with a bullhorn.
[00:17:51.762 --> 00:17:52.764]  I could go to this right now. $5,000.
[00:17:56.747 --> 00:17:58.148]  Until a budget of $100,000 has been spent.
[00:18:12.538 --> 00:18:18.163]  I think one of the kind of the things that we really need to be looking at in this debate is that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:18:18.283 --> 00:18:19.264]  Infowars.com.
[00:18:19.344 --> 00:18:20.365]  Infowars.com.
[00:18:20.445 --> 00:18:21.326]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[00:18:21.646 --> 00:18:22.707]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:18:22.908 --> 00:18:23.148]  Alright.
[00:18:23.168 --> 00:18:24.069]  Bill Clinton.
[00:18:24.089 --> 00:18:30.775]  I got this Hillary for prison t-shirt and I just want everyone to know about this like big presidential campaign that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:18:30.915 --> 00:18:31.656]  Infowars.com.
[00:18:32.618 --> 00:18:34.358]  Okay, thank you very much, Terrence.
[00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:39.220]  How can we make sure everybody gets a chance to participate?
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:51.302]  How can we help families succeed in most important jobs in this society, raising children and succeeding at work?
[00:18:51.322 --> 00:18:52.043]  How can we live together?
[00:18:52.343 --> 00:18:52.863]  He doesn't age.
[00:18:52.903 --> 00:18:53.463]  No, he doesn't.
[00:18:53.543 --> 00:18:54.443]  He looks great.
[00:18:54.523 --> 00:18:55.904]  We're all gonna rickroll.
[00:18:55.964 --> 00:18:56.164]  Exactly.
[00:18:56.184 --> 00:18:57.164]  We've had a $100,000 contest before.
[00:18:57.484 --> 00:18:57.964]  My budget's $100,000.
[00:18:58.204 --> 00:19:01.785]  That means if a bunch of people do this, I'll pay up to $100,000 and stop it.
[00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:08.280]  That's $1,000 if you just get the shirt on national TV.
[00:19:10.043 --> 00:19:11.145]  Visually rape.
[00:19:13.701 --> 00:19:15.742]  It is.
[00:19:16.663 --> 00:19:17.623]  It is.
[00:19:17.643 --> 00:19:18.804]  $5,000 if you get the audio.
[00:19:18.844 --> 00:19:19.504]  Legally and lawfully.
[00:19:19.524 --> 00:19:20.365]  They gotta be outdoors.
[00:19:20.745 --> 00:19:21.345]  Mother-in-law events.
[00:19:21.365 --> 00:19:22.246]  You gotta have a bullhorn.
[00:19:22.786 --> 00:19:24.387]  You gotta have the shirt on or have somebody with it.
[00:19:24.727 --> 00:19:28.850]  Or maybe a big sign with it on it and two of you hold it up and then somebody else bullhorns.
[00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.432]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, not a philanderer.
[00:19:32.992 --> 00:19:34.453]  Hillary covers up the rape.
[00:19:39.355 --> 00:19:42.036]  Look, I'm not going to sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:19:42.256 --> 00:19:45.317]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:19:45.618 --> 00:19:46.398]  Because it's already here.
[00:19:46.778 --> 00:19:47.438]  It's been announced.
[00:19:47.798 --> 00:19:51.260]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.601]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:19:53.721 --> 00:19:55.282]  A new battleship in the fight.
[00:19:55.482 --> 00:19:56.482]  InfoWars Live.
[00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:57.482]  Available right now.
[00:19:57.763 --> 00:19:59.023]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[00:19:59.043 --> 00:20:01.904]  Are you going to sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[00:20:01.924 --> 00:20:03.565]  Or are you going to be part of history?
[00:20:04.125 --> 00:20:07.126]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[00:20:07.627 --> 00:20:08.187]  Take action.
[00:20:12.836 --> 00:20:18.942]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.124 --> 00:20:31.173]  Oh yeah, it's the Airwolf Alex Jones here live.
[00:20:31.813 --> 00:20:35.777]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:20:36.297 --> 00:20:37.718]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:38.666 --> 00:20:43.249]  All right, I'm in the radio slash TV studio, the small studio, for the next hour and 40 minutes.
[00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:48.171]  And I'm gonna walk over to the TV studio and host at least four or five hours.
[00:20:48.872 --> 00:20:57.257]  Two hours before the debate, right through the debate, with limited commentary and analysis, then at least an hour with your phone calls and commentary after this evening.
[00:20:57.697 --> 00:20:59.498]  This is Make it or Break it for Donald Trump.
[00:21:01.021 --> 00:21:04.383]  They have hit him with, obviously edited, but it doesn't matter.
[00:21:04.523 --> 00:21:06.545]  It's still not something good to say as a family man.
[00:21:07.305 --> 00:21:09.186]  Comments on a bus 11 years ago.
[00:21:09.767 --> 00:21:10.928]  Clearly being asked questions.
[00:21:11.008 --> 00:21:12.449]  It's clearly edited.
[00:21:12.589 --> 00:21:15.050]  It's the type of talk you hear in a locker room.
[00:21:15.711 --> 00:21:18.052]  They've taken it out of context, but he's apologized for it.
[00:21:18.072 --> 00:21:19.433]  But they made it the biggest issue in the world.
[00:21:19.854 --> 00:21:22.595]  Hillary got four people killed in Benghazi in order to stand out.
[00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:24.697]  Hillary is engaged in all these other crimes.
[00:21:24.737 --> 00:21:30.601]  Sold out her sovereignty and been involved in espionage on the communist Chinese and Saudi Arabian and Qatari payroll.
[00:21:31.341 --> 00:21:39.048]  Hillary funds and supports jihadis, murdering Christians and women and sexually mutilating people, you name it.
[00:21:39.688 --> 00:21:40.709]  It goes on and on and on.
[00:21:40.749 --> 00:21:43.071]  And Bill Clinton has settled sexual assault cases.
[00:21:43.932 --> 00:21:52.519]  And the media totally ignores that and then acts like it is the end of the world when they dredge up 11-year-old tape on Trump.
[00:21:53.959 --> 00:21:54.780]  So, here's the deal.
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:22:07.150]  If Trump needs to resign, and these so-called Republican senators that were always against Trump early on, they couldn't beat him, so their constituents got mad at him, so they had to then, the last four months, support Trump, they're now doubling back.
[00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:09.552]  CNN says the Republican Party turns against him.
[00:22:09.912 --> 00:22:10.552]  Thank God!
[00:22:10.793 --> 00:22:12.114]  We're trying to take that over.
[00:22:13.223 --> 00:22:16.308]  I mean, not a word about JFK having sex with five, six women a day.
[00:22:16.328 --> 00:22:19.052]  Nothing about reportedly killing Meryl Monroe.
[00:22:19.252 --> 00:22:20.053]  All of that's okay.
[00:22:20.574 --> 00:22:21.956]  Nothing about Bill Clinton raping women.
[00:22:21.976 --> 00:22:26.563]  Oh my gosh, he shot his mouth off about wanting, you know, women, blah, blah, blah, when he was divorced.
[00:22:27.955 --> 00:22:29.656]  So all of this is going on.
[00:22:29.676 --> 00:22:30.776]  We knew this was coming out.
[00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:32.196]  We knew Trump's not been an angel.
[00:22:32.236 --> 00:22:33.497]  He's never said he was.
[00:22:34.417 --> 00:22:37.938]  The guy's never taken an aspirin, doesn't drink, because his brother died of alcoholism.
[00:22:38.338 --> 00:22:42.779]  He reportedly likes eating big meals, and he likes his wives, and when he's not married, he's a womanizer.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.520]  King David was a womanizer as well.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.001]  King David had his best friend killed to get his woman.
[00:22:47.341 --> 00:22:49.562]  He later repented of it, and God said, you're a man of your own heart.
[00:22:49.582 --> 00:22:52.782]  I just want to tell all the phony Christians on power trips, because I'm a Christian.
[00:22:53.803 --> 00:22:57.244]  I was out shooting a video up on a mountaintop dealing with Trump better
[00:22:58.024 --> 00:22:59.586]  Attack or drop out, same with the video.
[00:23:00.006 --> 00:23:04.130]  This guy walks over and he goes, Are you a Christian, Alex?
[00:23:04.471 --> 00:23:05.572]  Very accusatorily.
[00:23:05.592 --> 00:23:08.795]  And I said, I'm not like the Pharisees that stood up on the mountain and prayed in public.
[00:23:11.658 --> 00:23:12.179]  He goes, what do you mean?
[00:23:12.219 --> 00:23:15.983]  I go, well, you know, Christ said don't go pray in public and tell people how big you are and how Christian you are.
[00:23:16.263 --> 00:23:17.724]  And he beat the Pharisees with a whip.
[00:23:18.522 --> 00:23:29.146]  So, of course I'm a Christian, but I'm not going to sit here with you like all accusatorily, like you're on the high mountain judging me on your power trip because you're all full of your garbage.
[00:23:29.566 --> 00:23:33.128]  Get the beam out of your eye before you tell me about the speck in mine.
[00:23:35.609 --> 00:23:43.332]  Promoting abortion, promoting globalism, promoting GMO, promoting world government, promoting cross-species chimeras, these are the blasphemies.
[00:23:46.834 --> 00:23:52.555]  But the devil's an accuser and wants to tell people that have done small things, you can't be a good person in the world because you do these little things.
[00:23:52.835 --> 00:23:58.937]  The average good person goes, okay, since I have a conscience and guilt, I'll just stand down in the world and then let the total evil take over.
[00:24:00.817 --> 00:24:06.918]  It's what you do now against the great evil of world government that proves your worth, ladies and gentlemen, and will save this civilization.
[00:24:09.999 --> 00:24:14.580]  Now, coming up after this break, I'm going to give you the big enchilada.
[00:24:15.472 --> 00:24:24.397]  The battle plan from a high-level Democratic Party operative who is so upset about the evil they're seeing and so upset about all the crazy stuff they see.
[00:24:24.557 --> 00:24:33.763]  And look, this is why a lot of Democrats are actually turning against Hillary, who are very liberal on a lot of issues that I even agree with on some issues, on some of the social issues.
[00:24:33.863 --> 00:24:34.363]  I understand.
[00:24:34.383 --> 00:24:35.224]  I'm not out to get people.
[00:24:35.744 --> 00:24:41.788]  I understand that some of the right-wing folks have just obsessed on things as their political diversion from all the things they're doing.
[00:24:43.609 --> 00:24:50.360]  But it's Hillary saying she wants war with Iran, and I'm saying Iran's a perfect, but that she, quote, will attack Iran, and she, quote, will attack Russia.
[00:24:51.297 --> 00:24:57.180]  And the fact that Soros has this big flaming you-know-what for Russia that has our military upset and concerned.
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:01.802]  It has a lot of well-meaning, really smart intellectual liberals like Cy Hirsch and others.
[00:25:02.062 --> 00:25:03.363]  And Cy Hirsch isn't my source.
[00:25:04.003 --> 00:25:12.607]  You notice Cy Hirsch has come on the show this year and tip his hat to our work on the military stand down with fighting for Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[00:25:12.667 --> 00:25:15.629]  They've told Obama and Hillary we're not doing that.
[00:25:16.229 --> 00:25:19.391]  And as bad as Obama's been, I will say I believe Hillary's worse now.
[00:25:20.111 --> 00:25:24.474]  Because it's been Obama in memos and emails that have come out saying, no, we're not doing that.
[00:25:24.514 --> 00:25:25.535]  That'll start a war with Russia.
[00:25:26.096 --> 00:25:28.037]  And he's already allowed a lot of aggressive actions.
[00:25:29.058 --> 00:25:33.621]  But he did listen to our generals four years ago on not being al-Qaeda slash ISIS's air force.
[00:25:33.921 --> 00:25:34.502]  Remember all that?
[00:25:34.542 --> 00:25:35.162]  We broke it here.
[00:25:35.643 --> 00:25:39.706]  Came out three years later, three and a half years later, all the secret stuff we told you was on record.
[00:25:40.646 --> 00:25:42.227]  Just like they were going to federalize the election.
[00:25:42.448 --> 00:25:43.809]  They announced it a month after we told you.
[00:25:44.449 --> 00:25:49.193]  Or just like we, you know, have folks all over the country shouting, Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[00:25:49.861 --> 00:25:51.602]  That's now happened 14 times I know of.
[00:25:51.662 --> 00:25:52.883]  I mean, this show has power.
[00:25:52.903 --> 00:26:00.127]  I just want listeners to know, you're out there all alone somewhere and have no idea how many brethren you've got of every race, color, and creed, and both sexes.
[00:26:02.288 --> 00:26:12.054]  People are awake, they know what's going on, and you can see the huge train of death behind the Clintons and the Bushes, and that's what this is, this same dynasty.
[00:26:12.807 --> 00:26:26.022]  With a half million dead kids in Iraq with sanctions that Clinton's made worse, and bombing Serbia, and bombing Sudan, and blowing up their aspirin factories, and funding jihadi invasions of Sudan, and funding jihadi invasions of Kenya that Obama's been involved in.
[00:26:26.082 --> 00:26:28.305]  These are really anti-Christian bad people.
[00:26:31.596 --> 00:26:33.957]  To the liberals, to the conservatives, to libertarians, to everybody.
[00:26:34.097 --> 00:26:38.118]  We all know we're not going to vote for the mentally deficient, in my view, Gary Johnson.
[00:26:38.598 --> 00:26:40.499]  I told you that before you saw him melt down.
[00:26:41.259 --> 00:26:44.680]  He flipped out in this very studio in front of me repeated times a year ago when he was here.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:45.840]  I mean, I thought something was wrong with him.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.080]  People said, really?
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:47.721]  We haven't seen that.
[00:26:47.741 --> 00:26:49.641]  And the whole city started doing it all over TV.
[00:26:50.661 --> 00:26:52.662]  Sticking his tongue out, blacking out.
[00:26:52.742 --> 00:26:54.443]  I mean, I don't know what these people are on, okay?
[00:26:54.463 --> 00:26:56.983]  I don't know why Hillary's all spacing out and falling down.
[00:26:57.023 --> 00:26:59.264]  But they're on some weird stuff, okay?
[00:27:00.526 --> 00:27:01.607]  So what is Aleppo?
[00:27:01.667 --> 00:27:02.727]  Can't name one foreign leader.
[00:27:02.747 --> 00:27:04.268]  Sticks his tongue out over and over again.
[00:27:04.288 --> 00:27:05.209]  Starts going in circles.
[00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:07.190]  I don't know what's going on with these people.
[00:27:09.432 --> 00:27:10.572]  But weird stuff's happening.
[00:27:12.093 --> 00:27:20.879]  We got a bunch of the folks today and tomorrow coming on that have been confronting Clinton and have been confronting his surrogate and Hillary's surrogate, Tim Kaine.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.861]  On national TV.
[00:27:23.581 --> 00:27:24.382]  It's all coming up today.
[00:27:24.442 --> 00:27:26.924]  Roger Stone, separately, I called him about my data dump.
[00:27:27.664 --> 00:27:33.449]  He can only confirm from his New York sources, mine are in DC, two of the things that I had in my data dump.
[00:27:33.469 --> 00:27:36.011]  But he said that sounds very credible from what I'm hearing.
[00:27:36.031 --> 00:27:38.913]  And he's obviously meeting with Trump hours every day there in New York.
[00:27:41.275 --> 00:27:43.737]  But I've confirmed this with other sources as well.
[00:27:44.097 --> 00:27:44.838]  This is coming up.
[00:27:45.712 --> 00:27:46.453]  After the break.
[00:27:47.013 --> 00:27:55.541]  But then Stone's coming on with his inside baseball from another source very, very close on what Hillary is planning to do in the debate tonight.
[00:27:55.921 --> 00:27:57.342]  It's coming up in three and a half hours.
[00:27:58.703 --> 00:27:59.464]  So that's all coming up.
[00:27:59.484 --> 00:28:00.465]  And I want to go out to break.
[00:28:00.865 --> 00:28:03.087]  There's been two new confrontations the last two days.
[00:28:03.407 --> 00:28:04.748]  Well, a third and a fourth are coming in.
[00:28:04.929 --> 00:28:05.389]  We heard about it.
[00:28:05.409 --> 00:28:07.331]  We haven't gotten the videos yet, but two we know of.
[00:28:08.897 --> 00:28:10.637]  Uh, and this is pretty, pretty powerful stuff.
[00:28:10.677 --> 00:28:13.198]  Protesters taunt Bill Clinton at Milwaukee rally.
[00:28:13.218 --> 00:28:15.199]  He's been confronted three times now in the last week.
[00:28:15.239 --> 00:28:17.059]  DrugsReport.com is linked to this.
[00:28:17.119 --> 00:28:20.160]  Two different people jump in when he brings up a key point.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:21.700]  And then we've got another clip.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.040]  Here it is.
[00:28:23.721 --> 00:28:26.761]  Nobody can dispute the fact that you're a rapist!
[00:28:26.801 --> 00:28:29.002]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[00:28:38.089 --> 00:28:38.970]  It goes on and on.
[00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:41.831]  We're going to come back with the rest of this in one more clip and then give you the big data dump.
[00:28:42.432 --> 00:28:44.953]  But listen, we initiated this even though it's very dangerous.
[00:28:45.813 --> 00:28:47.915]  I'm not saying, oh look, I'm walking a tightrope for no reason.
[00:28:47.935 --> 00:28:50.596]  I'm not doing this to sell popcorn to the stands.
[00:28:50.776 --> 00:28:55.379]  I'm doing this to save my family and because quite frankly, I'm not in control of myself.
[00:28:55.919 --> 00:28:57.840]  I've turned myself over to the will of God.
[00:28:58.181 --> 00:28:59.461]  I'm telling the truth at the very end.
[00:28:59.782 --> 00:29:00.922]  I'm going up against these people 110%.
[00:29:01.122 --> 00:29:02.623]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:02.643 --> 00:29:05.005]  Donald Trump's got to attack tonight or drop out.
[00:29:05.025 --> 00:29:05.525]  Stay with us.
[00:29:08.985 --> 00:29:10.427]  Folks, the message is clear.
[00:29:10.808 --> 00:29:12.009]  The parallels are there.
[00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:23.845]  There are millions of ordinary Americans who've been let down, who've had a bad time, who feel the political class in Washington are detached from them, who feel so many of their representatives are
[00:29:23.865 --> 00:29:27.847]  You are politically correct parts of that liberal media elite.
[00:29:28.207 --> 00:29:35.330]  They feel people aren't standing up for them and they've actually in many cases given up on the whole electoral process.
[00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:41.252]  And I think that you have a fantastic opportunity here with this campaign.
[00:29:41.712 --> 00:29:42.513]  You can go out.
[00:29:42.993 --> 00:29:44.413]  You can beat the pollsters.
[00:29:44.994 --> 00:29:46.734]  You can beat the commentators.
[00:29:47.194 --> 00:29:48.435]  You can beat Washington.
[00:29:48.775 --> 00:29:53.397]  Mr. Farage, you just recently resigned as the head of UKIP, still in the EU Parliament.
[00:29:53.918 --> 00:29:54.258]  Wow!
[00:29:54.298 --> 00:29:56.359]  Talk about a David versus Goliath story.
[00:29:56.699 --> 00:29:57.959]  This is epic.
[00:29:57.999 --> 00:29:58.420]  Well, it is.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:09.305]  I think the point about Brexit, Alex, is Brexit is the first victory against this phenomenon of the big banks, the big businesses, effectively owning politics.
[00:30:10.189 --> 00:30:14.152]  Literally willfully destroying nation-state democracy.
[00:30:14.212 --> 00:30:22.236]  Getting rid of that thing that our forebears actually fought and shed their blood to create and to preserve our liberties, our freedoms.
[00:30:22.457 --> 00:30:30.341]  All of that being taken away and suddenly, suddenly in a referendum that no one said we could win.
[00:30:30.361 --> 00:30:35.484]  I mean literally nobody thought Brexit would succeed and we've done it.
[00:30:36.245 --> 00:30:37.626]  Hillary represents
[00:30:38.733 --> 00:30:42.716]  Everything that has gone wrong in our lives in the last couple of decades.
[00:30:43.277 --> 00:30:56.246]  She is part, you know, of that class of people who have taken us into an endless series of foreign wars that I think arguably have made things worse, certainly in Libya and elsewhere, not better.
[00:30:57.067 --> 00:30:58.648]  She is part of that phenomenon.
[00:30:59.346 --> 00:31:03.207]  Where all that seems to matter now is corporatism.
[00:31:03.568 --> 00:31:21.014]  You know, the big global companies who want to set the rule books to effectively put out of business small and medium-sized competitors, they have destroyed, you know, what I believe to be proper free market capitalism, where your eye can go and set up a company, you know, and have a real chance of succeeding.
[00:31:21.574 --> 00:31:30.637]  And they've presided over a period where the rich have got richer and where ordinary, decent, working people have seen their living standards deteriorate.
[00:31:30.977 --> 00:31:32.718]  She represents failure.
[00:31:32.918 --> 00:31:38.140]  And she, of course, is completely unreconciled to the vote on Brexit.
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.240]  Because Hillary loves the European Union.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:46.642]  I think she sees the European Union as a prototype for an even bigger form of world government.
[00:31:46.763 --> 00:31:47.923]  But let me make it clear.
[00:31:48.744 --> 00:32:03.048]  If you want nothing to change at all, if you want to continue with the kind of cronyism that we see with the Clinton Foundation and everything else, if you want things to stay the same, you vote for Hillary.
[00:32:03.469 --> 00:32:07.650]  I wouldn't vote for Hillary if she paid me, and I feel pretty strongly about that.
[00:32:08.652 --> 00:32:10.013]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:32:10.293 --> 00:32:11.574]  You can't survive without it.
[00:32:11.774 --> 00:32:12.674]  But where do you get it?
[00:32:12.994 --> 00:32:18.758]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:32:18.978 --> 00:32:24.701]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:32:24.881 --> 00:32:41.748]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:32:42.148 --> 00:32:44.269]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:45.810]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:32:46.091 --> 00:32:46.811]  Easy assembly.
[00:32:47.131 --> 00:32:47.772]  Low maintenance.
[00:32:48.052 --> 00:32:49.873]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:33:13.303 --> 00:33:16.005]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:30.315]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:54.511 --> 00:33:56.312]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:33:56.372 --> 00:33:57.753]  Thank you so much for joining me.
[00:33:57.773 --> 00:34:11.961]  I want to finish up with these clips with the latest folks confronting the Clintons over their history of sexual crime, sexual abuse, and Hillary being the beard to play the part of the woman to go after the women that Bill has accused, including physically attacking them.
[00:34:12.441 --> 00:34:18.924]  Threatening them, women that Clinton's gotten pregnant, physically attacking the baby, trying to cause the woman to have a miscarriage.
[00:34:19.424 --> 00:34:23.906]  These witnesses, these articles are all on InfoWars.com, Breitbart.com.
[00:34:24.266 --> 00:34:25.106]  It's all coming out.
[00:34:25.867 --> 00:34:27.587]  But I covered this stuff all 20 years ago.
[00:34:28.308 --> 00:34:29.288]  This is well known.
[00:34:29.328 --> 00:34:35.111]  We've got big surprises this week with in-studio guests all throughout next week.
[00:34:36.751 --> 00:34:40.273]  So believe me when I tell you, you do not want to miss next week's
[00:34:41.226 --> 00:34:55.269]  Monday through Friday broadcast, because the biggest breaking news for this republic you've ever seen in our bombshell after bombshell broadcast this week is looking to be the creme de la creme, the coup de gras, the final blow.
[00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:56.430]  This is big.
[00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:00.090]  To say I'm on pins and needles is an understatement.
[00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:06.572]  I eat sleep, dream, you name it, what's happening?
[00:35:09.326 --> 00:35:13.167]  Now let's go back to the clip I was just playing of just yesterday.
[00:35:13.227 --> 00:35:14.447]  There's a new clip today.
[00:35:15.887 --> 00:35:18.328]  Protesters taunt Bill Clinton at Milwaukee rally.
[00:35:18.868 --> 00:35:21.168]  And the full 30 minute rally is up there.
[00:35:21.649 --> 00:35:33.651]  He starts talking about one thing we do know is, and two different gentlemen, they both look like veterans, start shouting out, and they've got Bill Clinton rape shirts, that Bill Clinton's a rapist and he has settled sexual assault cases.
[00:35:34.591 --> 00:35:36.352]  Now again, Trump wouldn't go here.
[00:35:36.852 --> 00:35:38.292]  He did like three months ago on Hannity.
[00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:43.392]  You wouldn't go here when Hitler was like, you once called a beauty pageant person Miss Piggy.
[00:35:43.653 --> 00:35:44.473]  Oh my gosh!
[00:35:45.414 --> 00:35:50.057]  Okay, you funded jihadis to take over worldwide and sexually mutilate women and kill hundreds of thousands of Christians.
[00:35:50.617 --> 00:35:53.699]  You know, General Flynn, the head of Defense Intelligence, exposed you!
[00:35:54.219 --> 00:35:58.922]  I mean, it's like, you once, you know, yelled at your child.
[00:35:59.823 --> 00:36:01.804]  Trump's like, okay, he wants barbecued children.
[00:36:01.904 --> 00:36:03.685]  I mean, it's totally different worlds.
[00:36:04.126 --> 00:36:08.889]  There's a graphic on Infowars.com we should show at the bottom, and everybody's saying it's the best ever.
[00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:12.802]  And it shows three big mountains in the background.
[00:36:13.322 --> 00:36:15.824]  One, Hillary Clinton email scandal is a giant mountain.
[00:36:16.204 --> 00:36:19.085]  Another snow top mountain is Clinton Foundation scandal.
[00:36:19.405 --> 00:36:24.248]  Another snow top mountain is Hillary Benghazi scandal.
[00:36:24.268 --> 00:36:34.933]  And it shows the Washington Post, owned by Bezos and run by Obama basically, Washington Post reporters, about 15 of them, with a magnifying glass looking at a mole hill, like a fire ant hill.
[00:36:36.465 --> 00:36:38.487]  I mean, I'm sorry, I don't like hearing Trump.
[00:36:39.348 --> 00:36:43.792]  It sounds a little punkish, but we all know guys, most guys do that.
[00:36:43.912 --> 00:36:46.474]  They're in the locker room, somebody brings up sex to them.
[00:36:46.534 --> 00:36:47.555]  Oh, you see this hot lady?
[00:36:48.156 --> 00:36:49.877]  Oh yeah, man, she's so hot.
[00:36:49.958 --> 00:36:51.419]  Yeah, boy, I'd really like to get her.
[00:36:51.439 --> 00:36:59.807]  I mean, everybody knows the real womanizers just keep their mouth shut.
[00:37:00.862 --> 00:37:03.104]  But the point is, is that it's no big deal.
[00:37:03.185 --> 00:37:05.807]  I mean, I want to think of Trump better as that, better than that.
[00:37:05.827 --> 00:37:06.728]  And this was 11 years ago.
[00:37:06.768 --> 00:37:08.190]  He says he's grown on the campaign trail.
[00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:09.772]  And I've talked to folks that know Trump.
[00:37:09.852 --> 00:37:11.253]  I've talked to Trump, as you know, quite a bit.
[00:37:11.634 --> 00:37:12.435]  I've talked to other people.
[00:37:13.561 --> 00:37:14.201]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:37:14.261 --> 00:37:14.922]  Involve with Trump.
[00:37:15.382 --> 00:37:18.384]  And he's really got concerned about the New World Order.
[00:37:18.784 --> 00:37:20.805]  Trump really knows about globalism and how the U.S.
[00:37:20.825 --> 00:37:21.465]  is being screwed over.
[00:37:21.805 --> 00:37:24.507]  Twenty-five years ago, he gave money to try to defeat NAFTA and GATT.
[00:37:24.807 --> 00:37:29.069]  He wrote big op-eds, paid to put them in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.
[00:37:29.149 --> 00:37:30.810]  I mean, we're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:37:31.591 --> 00:37:34.432]  He really doesn't like seeing the country get screwed.
[00:37:35.433 --> 00:37:36.093]  He's a great guy.
[00:37:36.513 --> 00:37:37.934]  He's got the establishment scared of him.
[00:37:38.985 --> 00:37:40.185]  But that's a New York thing.
[00:37:40.205 --> 00:37:41.406]  I mean, I don't want to say he's like Wiener.
[00:37:41.426 --> 00:37:44.927]  I mean, Wiener's 50 times worse, but you want to stereotype New Yorkers?
[00:37:45.147 --> 00:37:46.807]  I mean, I've been to New York a lot.
[00:37:46.827 --> 00:37:47.647]  They're great people.
[00:37:48.308 --> 00:37:49.748]  They're full of hospitality.
[00:37:51.268 --> 00:37:53.809]  You think New Yorkers don't have hospitality, but if they like it, they're full of hospitality.
[00:37:53.849 --> 00:38:00.491]  Buying you dinner, taking you here, giving you a great apartment to stay in, giving you tickets to a great play or, you know, to the Mets or the Yankees.
[00:38:02.017 --> 00:38:03.218]  And it's exactly like that.
[00:38:03.358 --> 00:38:05.640]  Oh, this girl, I like her, boy, she's great!
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.461]  I mean, that's what Yankees do.
[00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:09.262]  It's very Yankee.
[00:38:10.443 --> 00:38:11.404]  And I love Yankees.
[00:38:11.544 --> 00:38:16.728]  I mean, we want somebody that's got bravado, somebody that's gonna get in the face of the globalists, somebody that's bigger than life.
[00:38:16.828 --> 00:38:18.989]  And I'm sorry, John Wayne was a womanizer.
[00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:20.410]  I'm sorry.
[00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:21.511]  You know who else was a womanizer?
[00:38:22.172 --> 00:38:24.153]  Pretty much everybody that's an alpha male, okay?
[00:38:24.173 --> 00:38:26.575]  I mean, it goes with the territory.
[00:38:27.055 --> 00:38:28.036]  And I'm not forgiving.
[00:38:29.514 --> 00:38:31.816]  But no one has ever accused him of pedophilia.
[00:38:32.217 --> 00:38:34.059]  No one has ever accused him of underage women.
[00:38:34.319 --> 00:38:44.630]  And you look at Trump, and I know folks that know him, because we knew this attack was coming months ago, Trump likes big, aggressive, Amazon, beyond Marilyn Monroe.
[00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:47.774]  I mean, let me tell you, you start getting into six foot one women, that's a little much for me.
[00:38:49.738 --> 00:38:54.179]  Full, you know, 35, 40-year-old boom, vava boom.
[00:38:54.199 --> 00:38:56.500]  I mean, I know what men are like that like real women.
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:57.100]  I'm one of them.
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:58.580]  I like the whole nine yards.
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.781]  Trump goes beyond that.
[00:39:02.561 --> 00:39:04.422]  To women that are almost so female, they're scary.
[00:39:04.722 --> 00:39:05.562]  He ain't into women.
[00:39:06.182 --> 00:39:07.203]  I mean, he's into little girls.
[00:39:07.243 --> 00:39:07.823]  He's into women.
[00:39:08.403 --> 00:39:11.764]  And the whole point is, is that he's not into your average woman.
[00:39:11.784 --> 00:39:12.664]  He wants the Amazon.
[00:39:13.962 --> 00:39:22.166]  A whole different spectrum from what creepy people like Jeffrey Epstein, Bill Clinton's best buddy who founded the Clinton Foundation is.
[00:39:22.186 --> 00:39:29.429]  So we're going to play these clips and I'm going to start getting in to the Democratic Party dossier dump that we have.
[00:39:29.449 --> 00:39:37.313]  This is huge, it's important, and nine times out of ten our big scoops end up hitting pay dirt.
[00:39:37.393 --> 00:39:39.094]  There's been a few times I've been chumped.
[00:39:40.117 --> 00:39:41.438]  And I talked to the people involved.
[00:39:42.258 --> 00:39:42.738]  He said it.
[00:39:42.818 --> 00:39:45.119]  I mean, WikiLeaks has never not paid off.
[00:39:45.159 --> 00:39:46.480]  They've never not done what they say they do.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.742]  And he said, I'm going to release information that will get her indicted in the next two weeks.
[00:39:50.162 --> 00:39:51.062]  A month later, he hadn't done it.
[00:39:51.082 --> 00:39:52.123]  And he says, OK, in two weeks.
[00:39:52.483 --> 00:39:53.203]  Two weeks later, he hadn't done it.
[00:39:53.223 --> 00:39:55.184]  Then a week later, he says, I'll release it Wednesday.
[00:39:55.344 --> 00:39:58.726]  Then he said, I've gotten death threats for security concerns.
[00:39:58.766 --> 00:39:59.346]  I'm canceling it.
[00:39:59.927 --> 00:40:04.389]  Then he announces, now I'm going a day early on Tuesday via Skype to some German group.
[00:40:05.529 --> 00:40:06.890]  And I know people that talk to Assange.
[00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:08.311]  I've seen copies of the emails, OK?
[00:40:09.304 --> 00:40:11.285]  And he said, yes, I'm releasing it.
[00:40:12.125 --> 00:40:12.945]  Then he got threatened.
[00:40:12.965 --> 00:40:14.165]  They promised him some deal.
[00:40:14.645 --> 00:40:15.886]  They backed off the deal.
[00:40:15.906 --> 00:40:20.347]  They're playing games with him, folks, stalling, until they drop their payload on Trump.
[00:40:20.767 --> 00:40:21.407]  And they've now done it.
[00:40:21.987 --> 00:40:23.648]  And now it doesn't matter what WikiLeaks puts out, does it?
[00:40:23.668 --> 00:40:25.148]  Because they've already launched their big attack.
[00:40:26.108 --> 00:40:32.650]  And sure enough, they put out their stuff Friday, same day, same day that they put out all this Trump sex baloney.
[00:40:34.366 --> 00:40:35.086]  You know what, Gate?
[00:40:35.587 --> 00:40:36.387]  Pussycat, Gate.
[00:40:37.107 --> 00:40:41.950]  And all of this goes on, all of this unfolds, all of this happens.
[00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:46.091]  And they release some stuff with her at corporations, stuff we already knew.
[00:40:46.592 --> 00:40:50.874]  She's for NAFTA, she's for GATT, she's for the TPP, she said she wrote part of the TPP.
[00:40:52.655 --> 00:40:54.796]  Now they say 100,000 more are coming, let's see.
[00:40:55.156 --> 00:40:56.556]  I'm tired of being dangled along here.
[00:40:56.796 --> 00:41:01.859]  We're 29 days out, they got Trump hanging out there on, you know, flapping in the wind.
[00:41:03.663 --> 00:41:08.947]  I'm going to come back and give you the big data dump, but right now let's go to protesters taunting Bill Clinton at Milwaukee Rally.
[00:41:08.987 --> 00:41:09.307]  Here it is.
[00:41:10.908 --> 00:41:13.951]  Nobody can dispute the fact that you're a rapist.
[00:41:13.991 --> 00:41:14.991]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[00:41:15.011 --> 00:41:15.292]  Thank you.
[00:41:15.312 --> 00:41:15.752]  Thank you.
[00:41:15.772 --> 00:41:17.433]  Don't worry about it.
[00:41:38.943 --> 00:41:40.064]  Holding up the PDFs of the rape?
[00:41:40.084 --> 00:41:43.805]  These are great patriots.
[00:41:44.565 --> 00:41:51.367]  These guys are great patriots.
[00:41:54.348 --> 00:41:55.088]  Yeah, those guys are getting $5,000.
[00:41:55.288 --> 00:41:58.329]  Yeah, I'm paying $5,000 per person that does it.
[00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:00.469]  $1,000 if you just get the sign on TV for five seconds.
[00:42:00.849 --> 00:42:01.630]  Those are great patriots.
[00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:02.130]  We're already up about $25,000.
[00:42:03.686 --> 00:42:05.528]  So we got another 75,000 we can give out and then my budget's gone.
[00:42:05.548 --> 00:42:05.948]  Give back good.
[00:42:05.968 --> 00:42:14.235]  Give back good.
[00:42:14.255 --> 00:42:15.395]  Oh, give back good.
[00:42:15.476 --> 00:42:16.677]  Be loving to them.
[00:42:17.057 --> 00:42:19.859]  And when they throw you out, he says, oh, you don't want to be part of the conversation.
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:27.045]  He kills 97% of the money from the Haitian refugees when they bomb Belgrade, back jihadis.
[00:42:27.065 --> 00:42:27.725]  He's loving.
[00:42:27.765 --> 00:42:28.346]  He's Bill Clinton.
[00:42:28.366 --> 00:42:29.147]  He cares about you.
[00:42:30.441 --> 00:42:32.322]  Hillary Clinton doesn't even give people tips, folks.
[00:42:32.722 --> 00:42:33.842]  This is how monstrous she is.
[00:42:34.743 --> 00:42:36.564]  We are going to go to break now.
[00:42:36.584 --> 00:42:38.884]  We have another clip of another lady in St.
[00:42:38.904 --> 00:42:43.786]  Louis, side of the debate coming up in 3 hours and 15 minutes.
[00:42:44.207 --> 00:42:46.788]  She got on TV shouting, Bill Clinton's a rapist with a shirt.
[00:42:47.348 --> 00:42:49.269]  But before I get to that, I have to come back and give you
[00:42:50.362 --> 00:43:00.153]  The Democratic Party attack plan data dump from our Democratic Party high-level source that's worried about World War III is why we were given this information.
[00:43:00.173 --> 00:43:02.576]  Let me tell you, Hillary Clinton wants World War III.
[00:43:02.616 --> 00:43:03.998]  She is a psychotic demon.
[00:43:04.779 --> 00:43:06.581]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:06.601 --> 00:43:07.242]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:43:09.614 --> 00:43:16.698]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[00:43:17.079 --> 00:43:30.287]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[00:43:43.131 --> 00:43:49.073]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:15.356]  InfoWars is proud to announce the official InfoWars Live app, available now for iPhone and Android.

[00:44:37.412 --> 00:44:38.632]  The app is brand new.
[00:44:38.832 --> 00:44:39.913]  This is the first release.
[00:44:40.093 --> 00:44:42.214]  And it was completely built from the ground up.
[00:44:42.414 --> 00:44:45.975]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks attempting to deceive you.
[00:44:46.255 --> 00:44:54.881]  In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces who are trying to sway public opinion in an unnatural direction that only serves establishment agendas.
[00:44:55.101 --> 00:44:59.905]  But InfoWars Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.
[00:45:00.145 --> 00:45:07.490]  So download InfoWars Live today at InfoWars.com and learn what's really going on instead of being spoon-fed lies by the mainstream media.
[00:45:09.445 --> 00:45:10.565]  The brain force is here.
[00:45:11.085 --> 00:45:13.386]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:45:13.646 --> 00:45:21.488]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of brain force.
[00:45:22.248 --> 00:45:25.829]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:28.190]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:32.071]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:45:32.111 --> 00:45:35.232]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:45:35.732 --> 00:45:40.519]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:42.923]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:45:43.263 --> 00:45:47.690]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:49.873]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:45:50.494 --> 00:45:51.996]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:45:52.096 --> 00:45:52.236]  Exactly.
[00:45:52.256 --> 00:45:56.179]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:46:04.666]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:46:04.746 --> 00:46:06.467]  I'm gonna lay it out short, sweet.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:18.964]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[00:46:19.664 --> 00:46:23.646]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[00:46:24.507 --> 00:46:26.728]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[00:46:26.828 --> 00:46:28.009]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:31.231]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[00:46:32.192 --> 00:46:32.532]  Or more.
[00:46:32.632 --> 00:46:34.413]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[00:46:35.053 --> 00:46:36.534]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[00:46:37.755 --> 00:46:39.977]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[00:46:40.077 --> 00:46:41.838]  It's actually scary.
[00:46:42.738 --> 00:46:52.803]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[00:46:53.804 --> 00:47:06.630]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.
[00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:15.918]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.056 --> 00:47:25.537]  We are on the march.
[00:47:25.917 --> 00:47:28.318]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:47:29.078 --> 00:47:32.839]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:41.943]  I know most of you are conscious of this, but especially if you're listening to us on AMREF stations, you should tell your friends, your neighbors, your family, your co-workers to tune in.
[00:47:41.983 --> 00:47:45.344]  This is really earth-shattering important information we're about to cover.
[00:47:45.804 --> 00:47:52.787]  And you can also tell folks who are going to be watching the debate mainstream, we've licensed to carry the debate ourselves, we're going to have live feeds of it tonight.

[00:47:59.151 --> 00:48:08.998]  So this is starting now, 47 minutes ago, running right till past 10 o'clock Central, 11 o'clock Eastern, tonight at InfoWars.com forward slash show.

[00:48:22.836 --> 00:48:25.597]  Briefly, we have several specials that are going to end next week.
[00:48:26.497 --> 00:48:35.621]  We have the new DNA Force flagship product, 23% off, the Bio PQQ, the CoQ10, and a lot of other key enzymes that help you absorb it better.
[00:48:35.981 --> 00:48:41.343]  There's 170 plus studies just behind the Bio PQQ to detoxify your cells, the ultimate antioxidant.
[00:48:42.603 --> 00:48:45.304]  There's no such thing as a fountain of youth, but this is as close as you're going to get to it.
[00:48:45.844 --> 00:48:46.905]  Find out why it's so amazing.
[00:48:46.925 --> 00:48:48.045]  DNA Force discounted 23%.
[00:48:49.105 --> 00:48:55.327]  Read the five-star reviews from third-party sites we're linked to at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:48:55.567 --> 00:49:06.391]  And we have seven years in the making, what we believe is the ultimate system of 50 billion live and active cultures from 23 different probiotic strains with biome defense
[00:49:07.622 --> 00:49:08.603]  We're good to go.
[00:49:23.194 --> 00:49:31.080]  We also have the Infowar Solar Base Station and Control System, one of the most modern, high-tech, high-quality systems, which is less money than the average system.
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:32.221]  We go out and find the very best.
[00:49:33.042 --> 00:49:39.947]  It lasts eight times longer than your typical unit because it uses unique lithium iron phosphate battery and more.
[00:49:40.287 --> 00:49:44.310]  InfowarStore.com, 33% off on that amazing unit.
[00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:46.131]  That's what funds this operation.
[00:49:46.191 --> 00:49:48.633]  Our reporters we've got popping in later from St.
[00:49:48.673 --> 00:49:48.954]  Louis.
[00:49:49.963 --> 00:49:53.287]  Before and after the debate tonight, they're going to be there covering it live.
[00:49:53.887 --> 00:50:02.257]  Our crew around the world, from the United Kingdom to California, that is the true independent media organization that we are setting up here.
[00:50:03.404 --> 00:50:09.988]  And then launching operations with citizen activists to expose the rape history and settling rape cases that Bill Clinton has.
[00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:12.230]  People are like, man, you got big huevos.
[00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:13.030]  You know what?
[00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:17.413]  It takes bigger huevos to let these criminals run things and start wars with other countries.
[00:50:18.134 --> 00:50:22.497]  My very gut, my spirit tells me I've got to fight as hard as I can or the chips fall.
[00:50:22.597 --> 00:50:23.577]  That's just up to God.
[00:50:23.637 --> 00:50:25.959]  I put my self into God's hands.
[00:50:26.019 --> 00:50:28.861]  I commit my soul to God and I know full well what I'm doing.
[00:50:28.881 --> 00:50:30.542]  I'm not going to let them snatch my victory.
[00:50:31.561 --> 00:50:32.821]  Whatever happens, I did the right thing.
[00:50:32.841 --> 00:50:36.842]  People keep telling me, you know the Clintons kill people, you know they're really dangerous, you know though.
[00:50:37.242 --> 00:50:38.903]  They've already come after me before, folks.
[00:50:39.583 --> 00:50:40.383]  I'm committed.
[00:50:41.003 --> 00:50:42.544]  Just recognize it for what it is.
[00:50:42.604 --> 00:50:44.864]  I'm not trying to act like Mr. Tough Guy here.
[00:50:45.484 --> 00:50:47.185]  I'm actually an introverted person in private.
[00:50:47.765 --> 00:50:51.146]  But I've got to get on the field, I've got to fight these people, and I'm doing it.
[00:50:51.166 --> 00:50:51.786]  So it's done.
[00:50:52.966 --> 00:50:53.806]  The dice cast.
[00:50:54.346 --> 00:50:55.647]  I'm going 110%.
[00:50:56.167 --> 00:50:57.587]  Forget the maneuvers, I'm going straight at them.
[00:50:58.427 --> 00:51:00.108]  That's when Providence kicks in, in my experience.
[00:51:01.909 --> 00:51:08.071]  I'll start covering it now with a basic summation, a basic boil down, and then I'll go through it all and then sum it all up.
[00:51:09.471 --> 00:51:10.332]  But how do you begin?
[00:51:11.672 --> 00:51:12.292]  Where do you start?
[00:51:14.233 --> 00:51:15.033]  Let's start at the beginning.
[00:51:16.554 --> 00:51:26.797]  And I'll give you the entire attack plan the Democrats have the next 29 days till the historic election in this epic countdown that we are all witnessing.
[00:51:28.524 --> 00:51:44.107]  Before I get into their data dump and what they're about to launch tomorrow and the next day, let me just remind you we're giving this information because even high-level Democrats are concerned about Hillary and her mental illness, her tantrums, her convulsions.
[00:51:44.127 --> 00:51:50.448]  It's like the Secret Service told us he was falling down as he has a black van with special rising systems a month before it was in the news.
[00:51:51.388 --> 00:51:54.049]  This isn't from the Secret Service, this is from a high-level Democrat.
[00:51:57.483 --> 00:52:02.146]  And it's because they're really concerned that Hillary is a megalomaniac who's going to kill everybody with World War III.
[00:52:02.667 --> 00:52:04.388]  And everybody in their gut is on edge, folks.
[00:52:04.568 --> 00:52:06.930]  Now let me give you background first, why they're doing this.
[00:52:08.551 --> 00:52:09.972]  What are the Clintons' Achilles heel?
[00:52:10.252 --> 00:52:12.534]  Being espionage agents, selling out the country.
[00:52:12.554 --> 00:52:13.495]  Yeah, but folks know about that.
[00:52:13.575 --> 00:52:14.175]  Lying about emails.
[00:52:14.215 --> 00:52:14.936]  Okay, but we know about that.
[00:52:15.516 --> 00:52:17.718]  They want to make it all about how women love Hillary.
[00:52:18.118 --> 00:52:21.941]  She represents the women and builds this angel and our first black president and all this other bull.
[00:52:23.763 --> 00:52:25.304]  So let's go back to the New York Post.
[00:52:25.665 --> 00:52:29.028]  The sex slave scandal that exposed pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:52:29.448 --> 00:52:29.668]  Okay?
[00:52:30.189 --> 00:52:30.749]  That's one article.
[00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:31.670]  There's thousands.
[00:52:32.511 --> 00:52:33.071]  Fox News.
[00:52:33.392 --> 00:52:37.235]  Flight logs show Bill Clinton flew on sex offenders jet, much more than previously known.
[00:52:37.255 --> 00:52:44.282]  And they don't normally, on one of these big private jets, make you log through Homeland Security or other governments, but when they did, it was 16 different occasions.
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:46.380]  That's total flights.
[00:52:47.201 --> 00:52:52.684]  Bill Clinton took twice as many flights on pedophile island billionaires Lolita Express than previously reported.
[00:52:52.704 --> 00:52:55.946]  Remember Lolita is a book about a man's love affair with a 13-year-old girl.
[00:52:58.007 --> 00:53:05.191]  He founded the Clinton Foundation, the huge money laundering operation, but guilty to one charge of pedophilia, but all the rest of it got shut down.
[00:53:05.211 --> 00:53:11.415]  The madam that ran it all for him, they all got immunity, just like the FBI just did for Hillary and her people on the emails.
[00:53:12.725 --> 00:53:16.268]  Bill Clinton ditched Secret Service on multiple Lolita Express flights.
[00:53:16.348 --> 00:53:16.708]  Report.
[00:53:18.009 --> 00:53:19.090]  Wonder why he did that.
[00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:21.872]  I did not have sex with those 10-year-old girls.
[00:53:23.093 --> 00:53:26.275]  Bill Clinton was frequent flyer on pedophile private jet Lolita Express.
[00:53:26.936 --> 00:53:27.276]  RT.
[00:53:29.498 --> 00:53:30.238]  Washington Post.
[00:53:31.459 --> 00:53:34.421]  The billionaire pedophile who could bring down Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
[00:53:34.882 --> 00:53:37.164]  Oh, the Daily Beast.
[00:53:38.228 --> 00:53:40.511]  Now, this was all over a year ago, I just covered.
[00:53:41.271 --> 00:53:54.706]  Now we start seeing this, because Donald Trump, two miles from his club, was invited to a party, gets there, there's like underage girls jumping around a pool, he thinks it's weird.
[00:53:55.106 --> 00:53:56.928]  Heard about this over two years ago, he leaves.
[00:53:57.769 --> 00:53:58.570]  That's all they've got.
[00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:00.412]  But they mix it all in together, okay?
[00:54:05.575 --> 00:54:06.196]  That's Daily Beast.
[00:54:07.136 --> 00:54:07.497]  What is it?
[00:54:08.057 --> 00:54:08.338]  Newsweek.
[00:54:08.358 --> 00:54:09.539]  All right, here's Daily Mail.
[00:54:09.759 --> 00:54:10.299]  Exclusive.
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:20.449]  The cozy relationship between billionaire Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton, who flew in the pedophile's private jet and once praised his insights and generosity, detailed in a new book by James Patterson.
[00:54:22.611 --> 00:54:26.455]  The shameful way feds protect convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:54:26.855 --> 00:54:27.336]  Law news.
[00:54:28.397 --> 00:54:29.598]  Now, they basically covered it all up.
[00:54:31.067 --> 00:54:32.247]  It's like we just saw for the Clintons.
[00:54:32.307 --> 00:54:34.048]  Okay, so we have that information.
[00:54:34.088 --> 00:54:40.069]  We know Trump likes six-foot-one supermodels that are 30 years old.
[00:54:40.109 --> 00:54:40.749]  That's his type.
[00:54:40.769 --> 00:54:41.609]  That's what he goes after.
[00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:48.271]  You got the Clinton settling rape cases, Hillary covering up for pedophile cases.
[00:54:48.291 --> 00:54:49.031]  This is all on record.
[00:54:49.051 --> 00:54:51.872]  It's going to come up in the debate tonight of Trump counterpunches.
[00:54:51.912 --> 00:54:52.592]  That's what I've been told.
[00:54:54.639 --> 00:54:56.080]  And again, Roger Stone joins us later.
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.120]  He's not part of this data dump.
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:02.502]  When Roger Stone joins us later, he reportedly, and he's been right 15 times out of 16.
[00:55:02.542 --> 00:55:03.623]  He's been wrong once.
[00:55:04.703 --> 00:55:07.405]  On the whole WikiLeaks thing, that's because, admittedly, Saanich backed off.
[00:55:08.445 --> 00:55:12.507]  You're going to get what he's been told she's planning to do in the debate.
[00:55:12.567 --> 00:55:14.388]  In fact, we were questioning, do we just let this go forward?
[00:55:14.708 --> 00:55:16.289]  Announce it as the debate begins?
[00:55:17.049 --> 00:55:18.510]  So we can prove we have the inside scoop?
[00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:23.672]  Or do we say it an hour before so Hillary gets cold feet and doesn't use this?
[00:55:24.633 --> 00:55:25.433]  Because believe me, they're watching.
[00:55:25.453 --> 00:55:29.714]  You've heard her attack his Media Matters room at the White House, right wing watch room at the White House in Toros.
[00:55:30.034 --> 00:55:31.555]  I mean, they watch every minute of what we do.
[00:55:31.595 --> 00:55:33.756]  They have books commissioned about us that are out.
[00:55:33.816 --> 00:55:36.256]  I mean, it is redonkulous.
[00:55:37.316 --> 00:55:38.737]  So we've got all that going on.
[00:55:41.278 --> 00:55:46.899]  Now, let me tell you what's coming up as soon as we come back in the next segment.
[00:55:47.819 --> 00:55:49.800]  I have, this isn't breaking until tomorrow.
[00:55:52.136 --> 00:56:00.838]  I have the lawsuits filed against Donald Trump, claiming with Mr. Epstein that they double-teamed little kids.
[00:56:03.958 --> 00:56:07.219]  Now Epstein's already been given basically immunity after his little slap on the wrist.
[00:56:07.239 --> 00:56:08.239]  So has the rest of his crew.
[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:11.160]  Now they've been given their deal by the FBI.
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:16.281]  Now they can say anything they want, including that they saw Donald Trump raping Easter bunnies
[00:56:17.768 --> 00:56:27.213]  Santa Claus, Mother Teresa, they saw him slitting babies' throats, they saw him sacrificing babies, they saw him... But what they say is, double-teaming little kids.
[00:56:27.233 --> 00:56:28.014]  Okay?
[00:56:28.854 --> 00:56:31.336]  Sorry to talk about stuff like this on a family show, but this is what's going on.
[00:56:31.736 --> 00:56:36.799]  And we have what they're planning, who they're going to release it, how it's going to unfold, who's involved, everything.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:42.682]  I was told this by another source a couple weeks ago, because these people talk.
[00:56:44.183 --> 00:56:46.184]  There's leaks everywhere, but I was given the data dump
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:47.901]  Because people are so scared.
[00:56:47.981 --> 00:56:49.722]  And they said, listen, all we care about is World War III.
[00:56:51.383 --> 00:56:54.465]  And people are really going, man, why do we fund jihadis to kill Christians?
[00:56:54.525 --> 00:56:59.688]  I mean, there are a lot of good Democrats, good liberals out there who are really, really upset.
[00:56:59.728 --> 00:57:03.210]  So judge sets date for hearing of lawsuits, Donald Trump of underage rape.
[00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:04.271]  See, seven hours ago.
[00:57:05.071 --> 00:57:07.733]  I told you yesterday, that's the only independent.
[00:57:07.773 --> 00:57:14.777]  I told you yesterday, in the early afternoon, 20-something hours before that broke.
[00:57:14.797 --> 00:57:15.798]  See, I didn't even know that broke.
[00:57:17.116 --> 00:57:21.099]  I told you, raping children, and now the... See?
[00:57:21.119 --> 00:57:21.940]  You just heard.
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:26.063]  A judge came in on the weekend and set the date.
[00:57:26.803 --> 00:57:28.064]  This is breaking as I speak.
[00:57:28.565 --> 00:57:31.107]  And we're forcing their timetable on all of this right now.
[00:57:33.388 --> 00:57:36.210]  Hell, we even had Roger Stone on a year ago talking about this and said it was coming.
[00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:37.151]  We gotta find that clip.
[00:57:38.132 --> 00:57:39.973]  That really documents it all when he brought all this up.
[00:57:40.474 --> 00:57:44.817]  And then I have these other sources, and they're just totally freaked out because they know it's totally made up.
[00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:51.498]  And so get ready, they primed the pump with Howard Stern clips and him joking around on the bus, just jock talk.
[00:57:52.399 --> 00:57:57.827]  I don't think it sticks really good, but give me a break, it's nothing compared to what Clinton does, actually raping people, and now it primes the pump for this.
[00:57:58.945 --> 00:58:17.394]  Ladies and gentlemen, this Sunday is the biggest presidential debate in United States history, and Infowars.com slash show will have complete coverage for you, starting at four o'clock central with the Alex Jones Show, and then rolling right through the entire debate, even afterwards taking your phone calls.
[00:58:17.714 --> 00:58:20.876]  Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump, round two, from St.
[00:58:20.896 --> 00:58:22.977]  Louis, Missouri, Washington University.
[00:58:23.217 --> 00:58:25.278]  This is the most anticipated debate
[00:58:25.858 --> 00:58:26.098]  Ever!

[01:00:02.852 --> 01:00:05.433]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:17.366 --> 01:00:18.968]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:19.288 --> 01:00:23.632]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:43.732 --> 01:00:55.217]  And we have several of the valiant Americans that have gone out to Clintonista events with Bill Clinton, Adam, you name it, Tim Kaine, and confronted Bill Clinton on his sexual crimes.
[01:00:55.278 --> 01:00:57.799]  One of those gentlemen is joining us coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:57.819 --> 01:01:00.160]  I'll continue with all this news as well.
[01:01:02.022 --> 01:01:07.283]  We're going to have coverage of the debate coming up tonight, coming up in three hours, right through the debate, after the debate.
[01:01:07.663 --> 01:01:09.524]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:01:09.544 --> 01:01:14.345]  A lot of TV and radio stations are obviously going to extend coverage and continue carrying broadcasts in about an hour.
[01:01:14.445 --> 01:01:19.486]  I'm going to go into the other studio for hosting from the big TV studio with my co-host and other guests.
[01:01:20.987 --> 01:01:25.688]  But understand, it is my duty to expose the Clintons and their narcotics trafficking.
[01:01:25.708 --> 01:01:27.228]  They're selling us out to foreign powers.
[01:01:27.288 --> 01:01:30.269]  They are international criminals like James Bond villains.
[01:01:31.325 --> 01:01:39.889]  So we just joined us, I exposed Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein and the FBI covering up and slapping him on the wrist and Bill Clinton flying to the pedophile island.
[01:01:41.110 --> 01:01:55.877]  But now, after Epstein's been cut out of this and given diplomatic immunity basically by the globalists, by the FBI, document cam for TV viewers please, we have the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, they waited until right before, 29 days out,
[01:01:57.398 --> 01:02:03.259]  They're gonna launch this tomorrow with 20 days out, 28 days out, show that it'll never get to court by then and of course get thrown out.
[01:02:04.059 --> 01:02:16.822]  Now they launched a few of these with fake names in Houston and other things eight and ten months ago to be able to give plausible deniability to the media and authors to write books about the fake filings to give it cover.
[01:02:18.722 --> 01:02:19.043]  Okay?
[01:02:21.323 --> 01:02:25.524]  That's why the Jesse Ventura ruling was so important when he was found to have been slandered and libeled.
[01:02:26.325 --> 01:02:30.008]  But then the courts reversed it and said, well, you're not allowed to get unjust enrichment.
[01:02:30.489 --> 01:02:33.091]  So yeah, a quarter million has to be paid, but no damages.
[01:02:33.692 --> 01:02:39.598]  So you can tell a lie that gives you the presidency, but only pay a quarter million, not 50 million.
[01:02:40.919 --> 01:02:41.479]  Or 30 million.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:42.580]  Or 10 million.
[01:02:43.761 --> 01:02:47.185]  And all the big media signed on to this, because folks, this is how dirty they are now.
[01:02:47.205 --> 01:02:49.567]  So you have to understand, you can't trust them.
[01:02:51.653 --> 01:02:55.136]  And they allege, under the name Jane Doe.
[01:02:55.316 --> 01:03:02.522]  So Jane Doe can say, again, that they caught me raping a baby xenomorph.
[01:03:02.782 --> 01:03:04.663]  A xenomorph is the alien from the movie Alien.
[01:03:04.744 --> 01:03:05.924]  It's not true, but whatever.
[01:03:06.545 --> 01:03:12.770]  So now Jane Doe has come out and said that they were raped 22 years ago.
[01:03:14.111 --> 01:03:14.772]  Yes, you heard me.
[01:03:15.512 --> 01:03:16.353]  In 1994.
[01:03:17.634 --> 01:03:19.856]  And magically, it was a girl in a bus station
[01:03:20.953 --> 01:03:26.376]  With the madam, who's already been given immunity, and then she told some other woman about it.
[01:03:26.456 --> 01:03:33.141]  A madam, given immunity by the FBI, who reportedly is supplying Epstein with all this stuff.
[01:03:33.181 --> 01:03:44.508]  A person supplying underage girls to Epstein, who's now pled guilty, so they all been given a deal, and then told some woman 20 years ago.
[01:03:44.748 --> 01:03:45.388]  Wow!
[01:03:46.249 --> 01:03:47.049]  Wow!
[01:03:47.149 --> 01:03:49.871]  That's really bombshell, isn't it?
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:58.466]  So they bring out his dirty talk, talking about a married woman or whatever, not good, not seemly, we know we're not going for a Boy Scout here, we never said he was, he's been honest.
[01:03:59.607 --> 01:03:59.907]  Whatever.
[01:04:02.769 --> 01:04:03.590]  We got that going on.
[01:04:04.791 --> 01:04:20.403]  And now on the heels of this, boom, the lawsuit's filed, and then boom, the judge just today, I didn't know they worked on the weekend, but notice it's breaking today, it was supposed to break tomorrow, but I broke it yesterday, so now the normal papers that put it out today, it's now coming out, that's the 24 hours after I told you,
[01:04:22.654 --> 01:04:23.714]  Wish I had jumped on this even earlier.
[01:04:23.734 --> 01:04:25.155]  I knew about it earlier, but I wanted all the documents.
[01:04:25.815 --> 01:04:27.596]  Declaration to support a plaintiff's record.
[01:04:27.636 --> 01:04:29.177]  This is Jan Doe.
[01:04:29.897 --> 01:04:31.498]  The reported madam, the supplier.
[01:04:31.518 --> 01:04:32.998]  You're supposed to believe her.
[01:04:33.038 --> 01:04:37.780]  She got the girl 22 years ago at a bus stop for Epstein and Trump, the double teamer.
[01:04:39.441 --> 01:04:41.562]  If you believe that, I got a rocket I'm gonna sell you.
[01:04:42.182 --> 01:04:42.782]  But another one.
[01:04:42.802 --> 01:04:44.463]  A declaration to support a plaintiff's claim.
[01:04:44.783 --> 01:04:45.423]  Tiffany Doe.
[01:04:45.503 --> 01:04:49.325]  Some woman says she supposedly told her that.
[01:04:50.649 --> 01:04:52.670]  So she corroborates 22 years ago, this happened.
[01:04:53.191 --> 01:04:54.251]  We've got them all signed, look!
[01:04:54.652 --> 01:04:56.093]  Joan Doe signed it!
[01:04:57.594 --> 01:05:01.076]  I mean, you might as well have Keebler Elf signing this thing.
[01:05:01.777 --> 01:05:02.657]  This is amazing.
[01:05:02.677 --> 01:05:04.218]  I'm gonna show folks as we go out to break.
[01:05:04.799 --> 01:05:06.640]  This shot right here, we got Joan Doe.
[01:05:10.623 --> 01:05:29.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, this Sunday is the biggest presidential debate in United States history, and Infowars.com slash show will have complete coverage for you, starting at four o'clock central with the Alex Jones Show, and then rolling right through the entire debate, even afterwards taking your phone calls.
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:32.563]  Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump, round two, from St.
[01:05:32.583 --> 01:05:34.665]  Louis, Missouri, Washington University.
[01:05:34.905 --> 01:05:36.987]  This is the most anticipated debate
[01:05:37.547 --> 01:05:37.767]  Ever!
[01:05:38.048 --> 01:05:45.073]  And we're going to have complete coverage for you at InfoWars.com slash show and also the new InfoWars live app.
[01:05:45.293 --> 01:05:55.021]  We're going to have boots on the ground and we're going to have the entire InfoWars crew in studio covering the debate, breaking down the things that the two candidates say in live time.
[01:05:55.321 --> 01:05:59.724]  Are you going to be stuck at home watching football or are you going to be engaged in the InfoWars?
[01:06:00.025 --> 01:06:05.509]  InfoWars.com slash show, InfoWars live app, complete coverage of the presidential debate.
[01:06:05.769 --> 01:06:08.432]  Round two, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
[01:06:18.861 --> 01:06:27.129]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:28.482 --> 01:06:39.594]  You know, we played the clip before, but I've had multiple MSNBC hosts say, quote, Alex Jones is deeply racist and influenced the Boston Bombers.
[01:06:40.973 --> 01:06:46.915]  We even have a promo where we play that clip and they didn't show where I influence the Boston Bombers or where I'm deeply racist.
[01:06:47.695 --> 01:06:50.416]  So I've experienced this stuff where they make stuff up about you.
[01:06:51.137 --> 01:07:08.423]  So we now have Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey E. Epstein being listed in the Southern District of New York by a Jane Doe and a Tiffany Doe and look, a Joan Doe
[01:07:10.017 --> 01:07:26.668]  All these does saying 22 years ago at a bus stop, an underage girl was picked up and taken by the madam who now swears this out against Trump, who's already pled guilty.
[01:07:26.688 --> 01:07:27.589]  We think this is the same madam.
[01:07:27.609 --> 01:07:29.730]  We're not sure, but this is their witness.
[01:07:30.711 --> 01:07:37.295]  But we know there was a madam earlier with Epstein who did, but then got let off and was given immunity with another person she talked to about it later.
[01:07:37.595 --> 01:07:38.696]  And there's Donald Trump.
[01:07:39.912 --> 01:07:40.713]  Going after.
[01:07:40.733 --> 01:07:44.895]  This is incredible.
[01:07:45.936 --> 01:07:47.877]  Double-teaming, supposedly.
[01:07:48.117 --> 01:07:51.920]  This is how they brought down the Vatican and installed the new Pope that wants world government and carbon taxes.
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.222]  This is how they take down all these institutions just with sex scandals.
[01:07:55.682 --> 01:07:57.844]  You have Clinton settling rape cases.
[01:07:57.864 --> 01:08:02.487]  You have Clinton 16 times flying on the Lolita Express with Epstein.
[01:08:03.067 --> 01:08:08.531]  You have his FBI, his government, protecting him and giving him a slap on the wrist, as well as the madam and others.
[01:08:10.165 --> 01:08:17.987]  You have all of this unfolding, and now you've got a bunch of secret people announcing this.
[01:08:18.007 --> 01:08:22.188]  You have the Clintons committing all these crimes, overthrowing countries, funding radical jihadistical Christians.
[01:08:22.908 --> 01:08:24.249]  You have all of this going on 24-7.
[01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:36.332]  And we knew they were coming up with a big October surprise, and we knew that the weakness of the Clintons was the sexual abuse and the reported pedophilia.
[01:08:37.072 --> 01:08:39.413]  And I'm about to give the final information and get to our next guest.
[01:08:41.004 --> 01:08:46.353]  And when Roger Stone joins us, separate from the Democratic Party insider, we're going to have what's supposedly coming up in the debate tonight.
[01:08:46.393 --> 01:08:48.897]  We'll see if this happens, but according to a source that's high level.
[01:08:51.181 --> 01:08:53.986]  But understand, they're going to release
[01:08:56.209 --> 01:09:02.073]  More supposed dirty talk of Trump when all these scumbags are totally dishonest recording.
[01:09:02.153 --> 01:09:05.796]  I mean, I love how the reporter who recorded him said, I'm sorry I didn't release this myself.
[01:09:06.076 --> 01:09:06.657]  I apologize.
[01:09:07.117 --> 01:09:09.679]  You're sitting there with some guy on a bus asking about girls.
[01:09:09.699 --> 01:09:11.620]  He's talking about this really hot lady he saw.
[01:09:11.641 --> 01:09:13.142]  And then this is the big evil.
[01:09:14.222 --> 01:09:16.704]  Where they make being a male evil.
[01:09:19.186 --> 01:09:20.227]  I mean, I don't talk like that.
[01:09:23.203 --> 01:09:27.608]  But the point is, I don't know, over the years, I guess the people recorded me every time they were around me.
[01:09:27.628 --> 01:09:30.752]  I might have shot my mouth off or made some jokes or said things.
[01:09:30.772 --> 01:09:31.893]  I mean, occasionally you're not yourself.
[01:09:31.933 --> 01:09:36.178]  But what Trump said is he said, listen, I've changed on this campaign.
[01:09:36.338 --> 01:09:39.082]  I've never lied about the fact that I'm not perfect and love women.
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:42.981]  It's not like we're trying to elect Mother Teresa here.
[01:09:43.601 --> 01:09:45.041]  We know Bill Clinton rapes women.
[01:09:45.081 --> 01:09:45.542]  It's come out.
[01:09:45.562 --> 01:09:46.422]  We know he lies to us.
[01:09:46.662 --> 01:09:49.703]  We know he bombs aspirin factories in Sudan to cover it up.
[01:09:49.783 --> 01:09:51.623]  We know they're sold out to foreign entrants.
[01:09:51.663 --> 01:09:53.364]  We know they're sold out to the Communist Chinese.
[01:09:53.804 --> 01:09:56.785]  We know the whole power structure that we claim we don't want is against Trump.
[01:09:58.486 --> 01:10:00.686]  Because they know he never has played ball with them.
[01:10:02.187 --> 01:10:03.987]  Never once been on Jeffrey Epstein's plane.
[01:10:04.087 --> 01:10:04.347]  None of it.
[01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:05.448]  So let's go through the rest of the articles.
[01:10:06.768 --> 01:10:08.989]  We have all these anonymous people, three of them coming out.
[01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:20.594]  But we've even got the Associated Press, Donald Trump, pedo lawsuit, refiled, accusing presidential candidate of raping girl 13 at 1994 party.
[01:10:22.516 --> 01:10:27.901]  Now, they filed one under another girl's name that was fake in Houston, again, what was it, 9-10 months ago.
[01:10:28.241 --> 01:10:31.123]  That's to be able to start writing the book so you don't get sued.
[01:10:31.183 --> 01:10:31.824]  Oh, I got it!
[01:10:31.864 --> 01:10:33.205]  No Jane Doe lawsuit!
[01:10:35.227 --> 01:10:37.729]  They got a book being published tomorrow.
[01:10:38.389 --> 01:10:38.830]  Just watch.
[01:10:41.067 --> 01:10:43.188]  Claiming all this, just perfectly all lined up.
[01:10:44.468 --> 01:10:44.988]  Here's another one.
[01:10:45.609 --> 01:10:49.470]  It smacks of a political smear job, ex-Trump aide tears apart rape lawsuit.
[01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:51.731]  That's out of Radar Online.
[01:10:54.952 --> 01:10:57.773]  Billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein created Clinton Foundation.
[01:10:57.813 --> 01:10:59.273]  Big article on that.
[01:10:59.393 --> 01:11:00.734]  Everybody should go look that up.
[01:11:00.834 --> 01:11:01.354]  It's a fact.
[01:11:01.394 --> 01:11:01.854]  Daily Mail.
[01:11:01.974 --> 01:11:02.554]  It is a fact.
[01:11:02.594 --> 01:11:03.875]  This is the Clinton Kingpin.
[01:11:06.172 --> 01:11:06.692]  It doesn't matter.
[01:11:06.732 --> 01:11:08.754]  The guy that created the thing has been convicted pedophile.
[01:11:09.054 --> 01:11:12.657]  Let's blame Donald Trump, because they knew that Trump was going to bring this up.
[01:11:12.677 --> 01:11:14.739]  And then somehow Trump got convinced not to bring it up earlier.
[01:11:14.759 --> 01:11:25.547]  He was advised to in the last debate, and he just... His daughter talked to Chelsea, and Hillary promised to be nice if he would, and she betrayed him.
[01:11:26.188 --> 01:11:27.629]  And I don't know why Trump did that.
[01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:34.214]  He got induced by the New York folks to be nice and don't go there, and she set him up
[01:11:35.438 --> 01:11:36.879]  You gotta go after them first!
[01:11:36.939 --> 01:11:37.800]  They're on the planes!
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:38.880]  They settle the cases!
[01:11:39.181 --> 01:11:40.381]  Everybody knows they're liars!
[01:11:40.422 --> 01:11:41.562]  Everybody knows he's a pervert!
[01:11:41.843 --> 01:11:43.904]  And you waited to try to be a nice guy!
[01:11:48.227 --> 01:11:48.767]  Unbelievable.
[01:11:49.928 --> 01:11:51.850]  And then a really scary article out of the Freebacon.
[01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:55.332]  The Clintons and the Sultan have a history.
[01:11:59.635 --> 01:12:05.039]  The Clintons and the Sultan of Brunei have a history.
[01:12:06.684 --> 01:12:12.027]  And then it just goes into his whole background and Clinton flying there on the pedophile plane to meet for days, get $2 million checks.
[01:12:12.047 --> 01:12:16.389]  I mean, this guy reportedly has a harem of little boys and girls, and the Saudis do too.
[01:12:16.649 --> 01:12:18.810]  But that's okay that Hillary gets $100 million from the Saudis.
[01:12:19.090 --> 01:12:27.094]  It's okay that she finances all this and hangs out with Jay-Z and folks that, you know, brag about orgies and everything, and Kanye and whoever else these people are.
[01:12:28.915 --> 01:12:29.435]  It's okay!
[01:12:29.495 --> 01:12:30.255]  But see, Trump!
[01:12:31.956 --> 01:12:33.397]  He shot his mouth off about loving women.
[01:12:34.935 --> 01:12:44.639]  If Jeffrey Epstein's non-prosecution agreement is overturned, Clinton ties to teen sex scandal could be exposed.
[01:12:44.899 --> 01:12:58.245]  Well don't worry, just pin it on Donald Trump and then make sure the puppet Hillary gets in and the elite will have a blackmailed minion who has nothing to lose, who's mentally ill, who's totally sick, they gotta roll around, who will do anything.
[01:12:58.585 --> 01:13:01.546]  You'll put a queen in who will follow your orders.
[01:13:02.952 --> 01:13:05.334]  To do anything, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:09.157 --> 01:13:09.897]  Think about that.
[01:13:09.957 --> 01:13:10.998]  So that's where we stand.
[01:13:11.038 --> 01:13:19.104]  The plan is to smear him with pedophilia when the Clintons are the ones on the airplane and the ones going to the known reported pedophile Sultan.
[01:13:19.925 --> 01:13:20.826]  And that's their plan.
[01:13:20.846 --> 01:13:23.668]  And we have a 90-minute debate coming up from St.
[01:13:23.708 --> 01:13:27.071]  Louis in two hours and 45 minutes.
[01:13:27.231 --> 01:13:29.613]  And we're going to be here right through it, live covering it.
[01:13:30.464 --> 01:13:32.205]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:13:32.566 --> 01:13:36.229]  Share that link to friends, family, neighbors, so people online can watch it.
[01:13:36.249 --> 01:13:49.119]  They can watch it on their smart TV, their TiVo, their Boxy, their Roku, or InfoWars.com forward slash app for the new free app that has video, audio, radio mode, and a lot of new functions about to get added in the next few weeks.
[01:13:49.519 --> 01:13:51.201]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:13:52.051 --> 01:13:52.672]  I'm going to go to break.
[01:13:53.192 --> 01:13:54.054]  He's waiting in the wings.
[01:13:54.194 --> 01:14:01.242]  He was the slickest of them all when MSNBC came out to him a few days ago and said, boy, you heard the Trump rally, and he laid out the facts about Hillary Clinton.
[01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:10.173]  Talked to this gentleman straight ahead, then Roger Stone's coming on with his inside scoop, and he's been right, I'd say, 15 out of 16 times, more like 20 out of one time.
[01:14:11.014 --> 01:14:18.560]  You know, he was told this by the WikiLeaks folks, and WikiLeaks said, we're going to get her indicted, we're about to release it, they strung everybody along, and they didn't do it.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:23.164]  Report was they got threats, and I said, okay, they'll probably release Milk Toast, and they did release Milk Toast on Friday.
[01:14:23.644 --> 01:14:25.706]  We know she's already wants globalism and North American Union.
[01:14:25.906 --> 01:14:27.047]  We already know she wants open borders.
[01:14:27.527 --> 01:14:30.450]  We already know she helped wrap the TPP, but it's all in her emails now.
[01:14:32.552 --> 01:14:35.434]  It's all in orders to come out, but it's not the stuff that will get her indicted, we were promised.
[01:14:37.235 --> 01:14:39.057]  So we're going to continue to dig through all this.
[01:14:41.087 --> 01:14:45.890]  The real activism is getting to people, friends and family that are on the fence, that don't know what's happening.
[01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:47.731]  Because Hillary is probably still going to lose.
[01:14:48.091 --> 01:14:54.734]  They've got big polls out, the LA Times, they've got Gallup polls out, showing Trump lost about half a point the last three days on this, if you believe it.
[01:14:55.675 --> 01:14:57.156]  People pretty much decided who they're going to vote for.
[01:14:57.972 --> 01:15:03.657]  And Trump's ahead in most battleground states, but they want to have the perception he lost or make him step down or make him go away.
[01:15:03.978 --> 01:15:09.563]  All the Republicans that tried to get him to step down during the primaries and they said, oh, your vote doesn't count and all that, that didn't fly.
[01:15:09.783 --> 01:15:12.906]  Their constituents were so mad, they had to play possum and claim they were for Trump.
[01:15:13.486 --> 01:15:19.512]  Now they're going to use this excuse, just like the Bushes saying they're going to vote for Hillary, to say, see, we told you so.
[01:15:19.712 --> 01:15:21.614]  Glenn Beck was told when he went to the Facebook meeting.
[01:15:22.793 --> 01:15:24.174]  We're going to shut down talk radio in 2017.
[01:15:24.214 --> 01:15:27.777]  We're going to shut down Vat Drudge, Infowars, Breitbart.
[01:15:27.957 --> 01:15:30.338]  Hillary's now said the alt-media doesn't have a right to exist.
[01:15:30.739 --> 01:15:31.139]  Alt-right.
[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:38.084]  And so he thinks it won't matter if he's a pariah with conservatives because he'll be the only conservative left.
[01:15:38.104 --> 01:15:46.370]  He'll be like, you know, they left two or three Jews alone in Nazi Germany to still be on radio and in films to make everybody think everything was okay.
[01:15:48.416 --> 01:15:54.061]  Same thing, he thinks, hell, if this is how I get my monopoly, they're going to arrest Alex Jones and Matt Drudge and Russell Embaugh or shut them down.
[01:15:55.161 --> 01:15:56.262]  They already had a coup at Fox.
[01:15:56.282 --> 01:16:00.746]  I mean, you know, Megyn Kelly, all of them sold out to Judas.
[01:16:01.847 --> 01:16:05.089]  We're going to come back with our guest, straight ahead, Peter Miller.
[01:16:05.730 --> 01:16:07.692]  Powerful information confronting the Clintons.
[01:16:08.973 --> 01:16:10.454]  I was raised a Democrat.
[01:16:11.334 --> 01:16:20.720]  See, I didn't know your story, but I think for all of us that's humanizing it, how you get to the point of this powerful speech that goes worldwide and wakes up so many people, I just knew it would be very interesting.
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:36.330]  So when Trump talks about the lies that the Democrat Party has told, and the failed policies, both in economics, education, and crime,
[01:16:39.184 --> 01:16:45.407]  Your heart should be stirred with passion and strength to do something about it!
[01:16:45.427 --> 01:16:49.289]  I'm from Louisiana originally.
[01:16:49.309 --> 01:16:55.193]  I consider myself a person who, I evacuated from Katrina.
[01:16:55.673 --> 01:16:59.295]  I was in a guard at the time, so I had to evacuate and I had to run back actually.
[01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:00.795]  I was called up to serve.
[01:17:01.216 --> 01:17:04.838]  So I did a month in search and rescue and three months of ICU.
[01:17:05.798 --> 01:17:07.198]  And that's where my conversion starts.
[01:17:08.079 --> 01:17:14.300]  I was taking a Blackhawk trip, and as I was taking the Blackhawk trip, we were actually looking for movement.
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:14.920]  That was our goal.
[01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:16.240]  We had to look for a new life.
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:18.361]  And just devastation upon devastation.
[01:17:18.401 --> 01:17:24.422]  I remember looking at the east side of New Orleans, and it was all gray, Alex.
[01:17:24.842 --> 01:17:25.542]  Everything was gray.
[01:17:26.222 --> 01:17:27.542]  So we gave up looking for life.
[01:17:27.743 --> 01:17:29.363]  We got to the Riverwalk.
[01:17:30.283 --> 01:17:32.604]  And I saw the pilot starting to cry.
[01:17:33.185 --> 01:17:37.167]  And I looked down, and it's nothing but men and women who look just like me.
[01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:40.208]  And that's when I knew we had believed a lie.
[01:17:40.909 --> 01:17:42.350]  The government cannot take care of you.
[01:17:42.850 --> 01:17:48.673]  It was droves of African Americans with their hands up in America looking for someone to be dropped down.
[01:17:48.753 --> 01:17:50.434]  I don't know the story, but let me guess, what color was the pilot?
[01:17:51.385 --> 01:17:53.006]  White, that was a shocking moment for me.
[01:17:53.646 --> 01:18:01.989]  And the amazing thing is that we circled back around to the east side later on that day because we had to only do footwork as well as air.
[01:18:02.469 --> 01:18:06.950]  So we went through the homes, making the marks on the walls and whatnot.
[01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:12.452]  In the rubbish of a house, I found a book called Up From Slavery by Booker T. Washington.
[01:18:12.752 --> 01:18:14.013]  At night, I would read that book.
[01:18:14.993 --> 01:18:16.533]  And it changed my life.
[01:18:16.633 --> 01:18:19.854]  Booker T. Washington was a entrepreneur.
[01:18:20.814 --> 01:18:23.315]  He was an education advocate.
[01:18:23.655 --> 01:18:25.696]  He started his own university.
[01:18:25.756 --> 01:18:28.676]  It would be no Tuskegee Airmen if it wasn't for this guy.
[01:18:28.696 --> 01:18:30.677]  It would be no Tuskegee University if it wasn't for this guy.
[01:18:31.097 --> 01:18:32.357]  Slavery has returned!
[01:18:35.398 --> 01:18:37.358]  And she is more vicious than ever before!
[01:18:39.059 --> 01:18:40.719]  Because this time she is colorblind.
[01:18:43.742 --> 01:18:45.678]  31% of white Americans.
[01:18:47.771 --> 01:18:48.652]  We're fair recipients.
[01:18:49.172 --> 01:18:50.253]  And that was my conversion.
[01:18:50.373 --> 01:18:58.718]  Between that experience, Katrina, obviously, and the book, seeing a black man who was unapologetic for being a Republican changed my entire life.
[01:18:58.858 --> 01:19:01.499]  My whole view of how I needed to advance my life.
[01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:07.543]  I would have never had the opportunity to be able to give a speech at a Trump rally to ignite fire in millions of people.
[01:19:07.623 --> 01:19:11.606]  But more importantly, I'm on a show that touches millions because of you.
[01:19:11.746 --> 01:19:13.246]  And we have a common heart.
[01:19:14.187 --> 01:19:26.778]  Well, that's what Trump does, whether it's myself or you, he gives a voice to other people that have important information, and then he's helping magnify a whole new group of people to truly create real diversity of ideas and thought.
[01:19:26.838 --> 01:19:30.782]  The top Democrat states in America are led by white liberals.
[01:19:30.982 --> 01:19:35.546]  For them, the blacks are the slaves that offer them the votes they need in order to stay in office.
[01:19:35.646 --> 01:19:41.068]  The sad thing is that African-Americans in those areas don't see the importance and the power of their vote.
[01:19:41.448 --> 01:19:44.109]  No one party should have a monopoly over the black vote.
[01:19:44.489 --> 01:19:45.729]  People want it, they need to earn it.
[01:19:45.989 --> 01:19:50.670]  The Democrat Party wants to corral African-Americans and minorities into one area so they can control them.
[01:19:50.991 --> 01:19:55.412]  And the African-Americans have given their vote over to Democrats and they've lost their power.
[01:19:55.432 --> 01:19:56.232]  Let's talk about Trump.
[01:19:56.252 --> 01:20:02.234]  We're going to break in a minute, but what's your, like, in-person meeting, what's your impression?
[01:20:03.075 --> 01:20:04.256]  He's just like you, truly.
[01:20:04.516 --> 01:20:07.357]  He's a guy who says what he thinks and gives it to you straight, no chaser.
[01:20:07.718 --> 01:20:09.159]  You gotta appreciate a man like that.
[01:20:13.341 --> 01:20:16.062]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:22.326 --> 01:20:27.209]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:44.263]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars is on the offense.
[01:20:44.423 --> 01:20:48.306]  We know that Bill Clinton has settled many rape cases.
[01:20:48.426 --> 01:20:49.027]  That's on record.
[01:20:49.047 --> 01:20:53.030]  We know there's a whole flotilla of women saying he brutally raped them and witnesses.
[01:20:53.890 --> 01:21:07.561]  And now they're going to counter the Clinton's biggest weakness with having the person the feds control, who pled guilty, who they let off for almost nothing like a year in jail for sex slavery, flying little kids to an island with Bill Clinton reportedly, sultans, you name it.
[01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:11.731]  By having, basically, Epstein come out and say he raped kids with Trump.
[01:21:12.971 --> 01:21:14.772]  That's their October surprise.
[01:21:14.872 --> 01:21:16.352]  It shows what these criminals will do.
[01:21:16.992 --> 01:21:17.973]  There is no end to it.
[01:21:18.053 --> 01:21:27.575]  And if the public is dumb enough to believe a convicted pedophile that flies around with Bill Clinton on a plane and believe the Clintons, I didn't have sex with that woman, it was a kid, then you will believe anything.
[01:21:28.695 --> 01:21:32.116]  And Roger Stone's coming up to talk about this and a lot more in the next segment.
[01:21:32.176 --> 01:21:34.137]  But Peter Miller is taking action.
[01:21:34.497 --> 01:21:36.017]  He was in Colorado a few days ago.
[01:21:36.037 --> 01:21:37.298]  There have now been 14 people
[01:21:39.209 --> 01:21:47.994]  Get on national TV, confront Bill Clinton, Hillary's had to stop her events because of it, Or Health, events that Tim Kaine's at, it is really freaking him out.
[01:21:48.795 --> 01:21:55.279]  But also, live TV, Fox News, MSNBC, Matt Lauer, it's all happening.
[01:21:56.239 --> 01:22:04.965]  Fourteen I know of, putting the meme out there that no, it's not about cheating on his wife, like they're claiming Trump's done, or talking about women.
[01:22:06.476 --> 01:22:07.737]  That's a red-blooded American right there.
[01:22:07.777 --> 01:22:08.577]  Sorry, that's just how it is.
[01:22:08.597 --> 01:22:09.258]  And that's not a crime.
[01:22:09.318 --> 01:22:10.158]  I'm not saying it's a good thing.
[01:22:11.519 --> 01:22:16.202]  But they're trying to change the subject onto Trump right now, and it's ridiculous.
[01:22:16.222 --> 01:22:21.585]  You should just call her out and go, big deal, I called a beauty contestant fat because she got big and wouldn't go out and do her job.
[01:22:21.906 --> 01:22:24.707]  I cut her contract, just like if a football player can't perform.
[01:22:25.087 --> 01:22:26.829]  And big deal, I should have done that.
[01:22:26.989 --> 01:22:28.670]  What the hell are you doing recording me in secret?
[01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:30.271]  That's the bigger issue.
[01:22:30.984 --> 01:22:33.989]  You're the one enabling a raper and funding jihadis worldwide.
[01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:35.753]  Now, Peter Miller is incredible.
[01:22:36.234 --> 01:22:42.284]  I saw him on his big Ask Me Anything Reddit, reddit.com forward slash r forward slash v underscore Donald.
[01:22:44.028 --> 01:22:45.508]  And he'll be with us a little bit in the next segment.
[01:22:45.548 --> 01:22:47.029]  Roger Stone's coming on as well.
[01:22:47.049 --> 01:22:51.830]  I want to invite him back up for a full 30 minutes later in the week because we're so limited on time tonight with all this breaking news.
[01:22:51.850 --> 01:22:57.631]  We have the other guy who was in Nevada and like for two minutes is screaming a rapist on ABC National News.
[01:22:58.512 --> 01:23:01.732]  These are great patriots who I want to probably try to hire as auxiliary reporters.
[01:23:02.233 --> 01:23:07.734]  But Peter Miller, here he is, just real quick, real clean on MSNBC, the most slick of all of them.
[01:23:08.971 --> 01:23:09.891]  Probably the way it should be done.
[01:23:10.612 --> 01:23:16.174]  And then we've got Donald inviting him up a few days ago on stage, showing he knows what a great job these folks are doing with our initiative.
[01:23:16.194 --> 01:23:18.055]  Here it is.
[01:23:18.435 --> 01:23:21.836]  Or maybe he didn't perform very well in some of his business endeavors.
[01:23:22.216 --> 01:23:27.939]  But I think one of the kind of the things that we really need to be looking at in this debate is that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[01:23:28.079 --> 01:23:29.019]  Infowars.com.
[01:23:29.139 --> 01:23:30.000]  Infowars.com.
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:31.100]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.501]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[01:23:32.521 --> 01:23:32.801]  Alright.
[01:23:32.821 --> 01:23:33.841]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[01:23:33.861 --> 01:23:36.442]  So he knew that he had a minute?
[01:23:36.902 --> 01:23:38.323]  That's how he wanted to use his time?
[01:23:39.483 --> 01:23:39.764]  Good.
[01:23:39.824 --> 01:23:40.864]  So let's go ahead now.
[01:23:40.904 --> 01:23:42.245]  This is a chain reaction, folks.
[01:23:42.305 --> 01:23:43.786]  A chain reaction all over the country, all over the world.
[01:23:43.826 --> 01:23:44.466]  We're not stopping.
[01:23:44.886 --> 01:23:47.648]  Mainstream media wants to cover up the rape, send protesters to Trump events.
[01:23:47.968 --> 01:23:52.210]  We're sending patriots to their events and Trump events as well to expose this.
[01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:52.930]  Culture jamming.
[01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:58.233]  So Peter Miller, here's one more clip of Trump inviting him up on stage a few days later to recognize what he did.
[01:24:18.052 --> 01:24:19.413]  Boy, that was a hard hug.
[01:24:19.793 --> 01:24:25.258]  He's a strong guy, I want to tell you that.
[01:24:30.407 --> 01:24:31.407]  I'm gonna cut my right arm off.
[01:24:31.427 --> 01:24:33.468]  I mean, just everything about me tells me he's good.
[01:24:33.508 --> 01:24:40.169]  His history, the fact that the elites hate him, never flew on the plane, went to one Epstein party, buys golf cars, was there like 15 minutes.
[01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.949]  We talked about that a year ago.
[01:24:41.309 --> 01:24:41.989]  We said this was coming.
[01:24:42.189 --> 01:24:45.850]  And then they blame him for pedophilia and have Jane Doe's file a deal.
[01:24:46.450 --> 01:24:47.451]  This is so big, folks.
[01:24:47.471 --> 01:24:48.391]  This is so dirty.
[01:24:49.571 --> 01:24:51.591]  Just like they say, he never was against the Iraq War.
[01:24:51.811 --> 01:24:56.572]  We have six clips, three the year of it, three right before it saying, don't do it, it's a bad idea.
[01:24:56.772 --> 01:24:57.933]  The media says, no, you don't.
[01:24:58.153 --> 01:24:59.353]  Lester Holt says, no, you don't.
[01:25:00.745 --> 01:25:02.566]  Peter Miller, thank you so much, my friend.
[01:25:02.626 --> 01:25:04.066]  Wow, it's crazy.
[01:25:04.086 --> 01:25:09.868]  Talk about what you did, what other folks are doing, the Shane reaction, and the behind-the-scenes that got you invited up on stage with Trump.
[01:25:11.568 --> 01:25:12.068]  Hey!
[01:25:12.188 --> 01:25:12.669]  Hey, Alex.
[01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:13.629]  Hey, great to be here.
[01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:15.609]  Just want to say thank you again for having me on.
[01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:17.030]  Thank you for plugging The Donald.
[01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:18.130]  Just a quick thing, too.
[01:25:18.170 --> 01:25:20.911]  I wanted to plug rsbn.tv.
[01:25:20.971 --> 01:25:25.052]  They're the good guys who go out and film all of Donald's rallies.
[01:25:25.432 --> 01:25:27.473]  Absolutely, and the right-side broadcasting.
[01:25:28.237 --> 01:25:29.638]  Yep, Right Side Broadcasting.
[01:25:29.698 --> 01:25:30.998]  They're true patriots out there.
[01:25:31.178 --> 01:25:32.819]  They're a great media outlet.
[01:25:33.059 --> 01:25:34.080]  Love the work they do.
[01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:37.241]  It's how I can follow Donald from home wherever I go.
[01:25:38.282 --> 01:25:46.465]  It's really great to be able to see him up there in front of tens of thousands of people, telling how we're going to put our foot down on the necks of globalism.
[01:25:47.866 --> 01:25:51.287]  Talk about... I mean, you did it very smoothly, very slickly.
[01:25:51.307 --> 01:25:52.468]  Some of these are hardcore.
[01:25:52.488 --> 01:25:54.209]  I mean, this is getting wild.
[01:25:54.469 --> 01:25:56.850]  How big do you think this will get with folks saying Bill Clinton's a rapist?
[01:25:57.466 --> 01:25:58.706]  Oh, I think it gets huge.
[01:25:58.746 --> 01:26:04.808]  I think it will, you know, once your stockpile of cash dries up, I think the message will still be out there.
[01:26:04.868 --> 01:26:08.830]  I think after a certain point, people have to recognize we're not doing it for the money.
[01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:10.330]  We're doing it to spread the truth.
[01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:12.171]  And that's what the most important thing is.
[01:26:13.131 --> 01:26:14.952]  You know, they try to slander Donald.
[01:26:14.992 --> 01:26:16.532]  He says this, he says that.
[01:26:16.932 --> 01:26:17.452]  But you know what?
[01:26:17.512 --> 01:26:20.053]  At the end of the day, Bill Clinton is the guy who did it.
[01:26:21.634 --> 01:26:23.574]  What do you make of this inversion of reality?
[01:26:23.654 --> 01:26:25.135]  No history, no claims in
[01:26:25.973 --> 01:26:36.315]  Forty-something years as an adult of rape, and now the very people Clinton works with that founded his foundation that he flies around on the rape plane with, they're having Jane Doe say it's Trump raping kids.
[01:26:36.936 --> 01:26:37.756]  It's bogus.
[01:26:37.916 --> 01:26:38.516]  It's bogus.
[01:26:38.576 --> 01:26:40.476]  I've heard these allegations for so long.
[01:26:40.516 --> 01:26:44.797]  If you go back and you see the records, Bill Clinton's what, flown 20-some odd times?
[01:26:45.698 --> 01:26:47.018]  It was 16, you're right, it's 20.
[01:26:47.078 --> 01:26:47.598]  I'm sorry, it's now 24.
[01:26:47.638 --> 01:26:48.418]  No, it was 16, then 20, then it's 24.
[01:26:48.478 --> 01:26:48.858]  You're right, it's 24.
[01:26:51.857 --> 01:26:57.801]  Going all the way out there to, you know, to Rape Island, Pedophile Island, whatever you want to call it.
[01:26:57.821 --> 01:26:59.182]  He does his three hour tour.
[01:26:59.243 --> 01:27:00.343]  He gets his jollies off.
[01:27:01.424 --> 01:27:06.828]  And yet at the end of the day, here we are talking about Donald Trump, some statements he made years ago.
[01:27:06.848 --> 01:27:12.793]  And I just think, you know, once again, it's the mainstream media trying to beat their false
[01:27:13.991 --> 01:27:19.815]  Beat their drum, try to cause a disturbance, try to say things about Donald that he's this, that, or the other.
[01:27:20.255 --> 01:27:25.399]  And even what's even more disturbing is just the conservatives who are really backing off of Donald.
[01:27:26.159 --> 01:27:27.680]  Paul Ryan up in Wisconsin.
[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:30.242]  Oh, they were forced by constituents to support him.
[01:27:30.262 --> 01:27:31.443]  They've always been double dealers.
[01:27:32.170 --> 01:27:35.212]  Oh yeah, they've been out for Donald from the start.
[01:27:35.252 --> 01:27:40.516]  I mean, they were just looking for one more reason to try to put their foot in the ground.
[01:27:40.836 --> 01:27:45.419]  They're the ones we should get rid of, and no matter what happens to Donald, this is all a sign of the sea change.
[01:27:45.439 --> 01:27:46.239]  You guys are gone.
[01:27:46.259 --> 01:27:50.482]  Look, we're going to throw out the Second Amendment.
[01:27:50.803 --> 01:27:57.107]  We're going to overturn the Supreme Court, all because Donald Trump said he was going to grab her by the pussy.
[01:27:57.547 --> 01:28:00.269]  Is that really the hill that we want to stand and die on?
[01:28:01.158 --> 01:28:03.079]  I mean, that's where we end this conversation.
[01:28:03.099 --> 01:28:09.181]  You know, it's like, he didn't want to sell us out to China, but once, behind, you know, in a locker room talk, he talked about a woman.
[01:28:10.182 --> 01:28:20.626]  I mean, it's a joke, and I'll be honest, I'm hardly ever like that, but every once in a while I get in a mood and I shoot my mouth off and act like a punk, and I kind of feel weird later, but haven't we all done that?
[01:28:22.127 --> 01:28:25.788]  Hey, any one of us with high levels of testosterone has done that.
[01:28:26.189 --> 01:28:27.029]  I can confirm that.
[01:28:28.066 --> 01:28:29.327]  Yeah, I mean, I can't be a hypocrite.
[01:28:29.367 --> 01:28:30.767]  I mean, he sounds like I did when I was 16.
[01:28:30.807 --> 01:28:36.610]  But I mean, I'm not trying to be mean to New Yorkers, but I mean, the talk, that's kind of New York culture, is it not?
[01:28:36.710 --> 01:28:38.250]  I mean, anybody's been in New York a lot?
[01:28:38.290 --> 01:28:39.171]  I mean, that's how the guys talk.
[01:28:40.351 --> 01:28:42.152]  I think it's culture throughout the country.
[01:28:42.272 --> 01:28:44.313]  I think it's... No, I agree, but isn't it worse?
[01:28:44.413 --> 01:28:46.074]  Isn't it worse like in New Jersey and New York?
[01:28:47.428 --> 01:28:48.329]  It might be, it might be.
[01:29:08.507 --> 01:29:17.214]  Mr. Trump, you've got five things to say, ten things to say, and what you do, and by the way, whenever you go on any TV show, listen to me, I know what I'm talking about.
[01:29:17.234 --> 01:29:20.237]  You're going to say what you want to say, irrespective of what they ask you.
[01:29:20.257 --> 01:29:22.759]  And if they don't ask you, you say, you know, it's funny, that reminds me.
[01:29:22.779 --> 01:29:23.819]  And then you go right into it.
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:24.560]  Absolutely.
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:27.022]  He never even talked about immigration.
[01:29:27.523 --> 01:29:30.125]  The thing that brought him to the dance, he never even talked about.
[01:29:30.145 --> 01:29:34.368]  Number two, he's got to understand that he has a plan.
[01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:47.054]  Beat soundly Alex, 16 of the best and the brightest of the Republican Party, coming to senators, governors, including a brain surgeon, an actual brain surgeon.
[01:29:47.694 --> 01:29:49.615]  He didn't go out there slamming Hillary Clinton.
[01:29:49.915 --> 01:29:51.076]  He gave them a vision.
[01:29:51.176 --> 01:29:57.458]  And he talked about basically a couple of things, illegal immigration and the sense of crime and losing.
[01:29:57.739 --> 01:30:00.780]  I would teach Donald Trump like a kata.
[01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:02.461]  We're good to go.
[01:30:21.128 --> 01:30:31.678]  And I want to talk to you, all you millennials, by the way, who were hosed by Bernie Sanders, who aren't necessarily going to vote for Hillary Clinton out of default, but who have been completely abandoned by this corrupt and venal system.
[01:30:32.019 --> 01:30:34.081]  I want to talk to you about this thing called whitewater.
[01:30:34.441 --> 01:30:39.546]  Once upon a time, there was something so big that the governor of Arkansas went to prison and people were indicted.
[01:30:39.946 --> 01:30:47.929]  This makes you talk about Atlantic City, where the city went bankrupt, where we have casinos and revel and wind and this.
[01:30:48.369 --> 01:30:51.871]  You're talking about I have 400 corporations, five went bankrupt.
[01:30:52.071 --> 01:30:53.391]  Let's look at Mitt Romney.
[01:30:53.611 --> 01:30:56.292]  Folks, bankruptcy is not the issue.
[01:30:56.372 --> 01:31:00.594]  Now, when she brings up Trump University, pray to God.
[01:31:00.854 --> 01:31:03.877]  God, she brings it up, say, I'm glad you brought that up.
[01:31:04.378 --> 01:31:06.740]  I want to talk about something called laureate.
[01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:15.508]  When you talk about how he's fat shaming in 90 whatever, some type of a beauty pageant contestant.
[01:31:16.469 --> 01:31:19.672]  I want to talk about sexual predation.
[01:31:20.809 --> 01:31:28.455]  Not Eleftherio, not somebody who's a skirt chaser, not somebody, but somebody who is a sexual predator.
[01:31:28.696 --> 01:31:34.380]  Now, remember, Bill Cosby, when people said, you know, that happened a long time ago.
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:34.961]  Who cares?
[01:31:35.221 --> 01:31:35.881]  It doesn't matter.
[01:31:36.182 --> 01:31:38.003]  Yeah, but you know, that was 40 years ago.
[01:31:38.123 --> 01:31:38.844]  It doesn't matter.
[01:31:39.284 --> 01:31:41.425]  Nobody blamed Bill Cosby's wife.
[01:31:41.845 --> 01:31:46.306]  They're looking at Hillary as the innocent spouse.
[01:31:46.666 --> 01:31:58.408]  When you are the Secretary of State and you can't say, give me the money, pay me the money and I'll give you most favored nation status or arms or whatever, you can't do that.
[01:31:58.928 --> 01:32:01.309]  What she did was, I'll tell you what,
[01:32:01.929 --> 01:32:04.651]  Pay the Clinton Foundation.
[01:32:05.351 --> 01:32:06.692]  That's the connection.
[01:32:07.232 --> 01:32:08.053]  That's the nexus.
[01:32:08.273 --> 01:32:12.115]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:12.456 --> 01:32:19.740]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable grape-tasting multivitamin formula available.

[01:32:39.177 --> 01:32:48.529]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[01:32:48.829 --> 01:32:50.510]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:20.652 --> 01:33:21.293]  I don't know.
[01:33:32.330 --> 01:33:34.812]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:34.932 --> 01:33:36.613]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.533 --> 01:33:39.434]  Now we're about to go to Roger Stone here in about five minutes.
[01:33:39.454 --> 01:33:41.315]  He'll arrive shot in with us a little bit in the next hour.
[01:33:42.016 --> 01:33:43.216]  Normally we tune in on Sunday.
[01:33:43.236 --> 01:33:44.277]  We go 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:44.317 --> 01:33:44.617]  Central.
[01:33:44.637 --> 01:33:45.137]  The show's over.
[01:33:45.698 --> 01:33:47.018]  We're going well past 10 p.m.
[01:33:47.038 --> 01:33:47.359]  tonight.
[01:33:47.779 --> 01:33:51.941]  If your station stops covering us in 35, you know, 30 minutes, Infowars.com.
[01:33:53.422 --> 01:34:01.307]  We have an updated app that has video and audio feeds and podcasts and a lot more.
[01:34:01.907 --> 01:34:10.111]  Infowars.com forward slash app and spread the word everybody you know to get real analysis on this debate and real inside baseball.
[01:34:10.492 --> 01:34:11.672]  We're going to Roger Stone in a moment.
[01:34:11.692 --> 01:34:15.515]  Now I have my separate data dump from a Democratic Party high-level person.
[01:34:15.855 --> 01:34:16.815]  This is high level.
[01:34:18.076 --> 01:34:19.537]  I'm going to talk to Stone here in a moment.
[01:34:20.546 --> 01:34:25.951]  I talked to him earlier today and he knew about parts of it, but I'm going to see what he can confirm or what his analysis is.
[01:34:25.971 --> 01:34:29.175]  But he said, I have more separately on the debate tonight.
[01:34:30.156 --> 01:34:34.700]  Now, by bringing this out, it may make Hillary not do it, but this is what he was told they're planning to do.
[01:34:36.182 --> 01:34:37.623]  So we're talking to Roger Stone here in just a moment.
[01:34:38.324 --> 01:34:40.066]  We've got another fellow joining us later in the next hour.
[01:34:41.343 --> 01:34:46.768]  Who also went and stood there in Nevada and screamed for like three minutes, Bill Clinton's a rapist, live on ABC News.
[01:34:46.788 --> 01:34:48.529]  So he's going to be popping up.
[01:34:49.570 --> 01:34:50.871]  But going back to Jeremy...
[01:34:52.336 --> 01:34:54.458]  Who's joining us, Spangle, right now.
[01:34:55.318 --> 01:34:56.799]  Or, excuse me, Peter Miller.
[01:34:56.819 --> 01:34:59.741]  Then Jeremy Spangle's joining us, after Roger Stone.
[01:35:00.042 --> 01:35:00.862]  He's the guy in Nevada.
[01:35:01.022 --> 01:35:01.983]  Peter was in Colorado.
[01:35:02.303 --> 01:35:04.445]  Trump invited him up on stage to add other points.
[01:35:04.485 --> 01:35:12.230]  Because this movement, 14 people now on national TV, many others that didn't get on national TV, are saying, hey, you're accusing Trump of sex stuff.
[01:35:12.731 --> 01:35:13.491]  We knew this was coming.
[01:35:14.712 --> 01:35:16.453]  What about Bill Clinton settling rape cases?
[01:35:16.693 --> 01:35:17.234]  Other points, sir.
[01:35:20.643 --> 01:35:22.264]  Other points you'd like to make, Peter Miller?
[01:35:22.925 --> 01:35:25.087]  Hey, it's Jesse from iVideos back up.
[01:35:25.167 --> 01:35:27.989]  I just wanted to share with you guys the basket of deplorables.
[01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:30.451]  And yes, my name is Peter Miller.
[01:35:30.491 --> 01:35:31.973]  John Miller is my uncle.
[01:35:32.453 --> 01:35:35.195]  These are some of the favorite things we have going out there.
[01:35:35.936 --> 01:35:39.139]  We got you, the madman himself, with all the other madmen.
[01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:40.900]  We got the Pepe.
[01:35:41.281 --> 01:35:42.161]  We love Pepe.
[01:35:42.382 --> 01:35:42.702]  Alright?
[01:35:43.182 --> 01:35:44.483]  Pepe is a symbol of peace.
[01:35:45.204 --> 01:35:46.245]  Do not take our memes.
[01:35:47.492 --> 01:35:49.774]  We got the Constitution.
[01:35:50.114 --> 01:35:51.435]  We know the liberals hate that.
[01:35:52.075 --> 01:35:54.497]  I hope we put out a trigger warning for all the cunts.
[01:35:54.857 --> 01:35:55.978]  We got the American flag.
[01:35:56.078 --> 01:35:56.999]  I'm getting through this, Alex.
[01:35:57.599 --> 01:35:59.600]  We got some lovely ladies supporting Trump.
[01:36:00.821 --> 01:36:02.142]  We got the Gadsden flag.
[01:36:02.983 --> 01:36:15.031]  And I guess the last thing I want to say before I check out, I know you got big people on, but on November 8th, get out, vote, and grab Lady Liberty by the pussy.
[01:36:15.492 --> 01:36:16.434]  Let's do this, folks.
[01:36:16.594 --> 01:36:18.458]  Let's make America great again.
[01:36:19.079 --> 01:36:19.500]  Thank you.
[01:36:19.961 --> 01:36:20.883]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[01:36:21.404 --> 01:36:22.066]  I'm a little bit...
[01:36:23.447 --> 01:36:24.348]  And I appreciate you joining us.
[01:36:24.368 --> 01:36:25.349]  We'll have you back on, my friend.
[01:36:25.929 --> 01:36:27.471]  I'm a little bit of a Victorian.
[01:36:27.491 --> 01:36:31.134]  I mean, I shouldn't be, but that's how I've been brought up to a certain point.
[01:36:31.154 --> 01:36:38.641]  But, you know, Donald Trump behind the scenes making jokes is nothing compared to Bill Clinton flying around on the Pedophile Express and raping countries, raping our Bill of Rights.
[01:36:39.441 --> 01:36:42.804]  In the latest emails, it has come out that she does plan to use executive order to ban our guns.
[01:36:42.844 --> 01:36:43.365]  That's confirmed.
[01:36:43.425 --> 01:36:44.386]  I haven't even gotten to that.
[01:36:44.646 --> 01:36:45.246]  That's in the statute.
[01:36:45.266 --> 01:36:45.807]  That's confirmed.
[01:36:46.167 --> 01:36:48.167]  So they're coming after our guns, folks.
[01:36:48.647 --> 01:36:49.068]  Oh, that's okay.
[01:36:49.088 --> 01:36:58.729]  I'm going to turn my guns in and kill America and further bankrupt us and go after the bitter clingers because Donald Trump 11 years ago got secretly recorded being baited into talking about locker rooms.
[01:36:58.989 --> 01:36:59.989]  We appreciate you joining us.
[01:37:00.029 --> 01:37:00.730]  Peter Miller, thank you.
[01:37:01.770 --> 01:37:02.310]  All right, folks.
[01:37:02.730 --> 01:37:03.410]  Thank you.
[01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:04.090]  You bet.
[01:37:04.210 --> 01:37:07.431]  Now, joining us is Roger Stone.
[01:37:07.451 --> 01:37:09.811]  He'll probably be popping in tonight after the debate as well.
[01:37:10.911 --> 01:37:11.811]  It's 90 minutes long.
[01:37:11.891 --> 01:37:13.532]  It kicks off at 8 o'clock central.
[01:37:13.872 --> 01:37:14.572]  We have the feed.
[01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:18.491]  So we're going to have before, during, and after analysis.
[01:37:18.651 --> 01:37:26.833]  I believe if Trump doesn't come out of the gates and attack, and really just overturn the money changers tables, and just point out the whole things of Assad, that's what people want.
[01:37:27.473 --> 01:37:30.614]  The mainstream media has a 6% trust rate AP study shows.
[01:37:30.654 --> 01:37:31.495]  I agree with that analysis.
[01:37:32.135 --> 01:37:34.476]  If he doesn't just hit them with everything, he's going to be eaten alive.
[01:37:36.596 --> 01:37:39.039]  We'll get Roger Stone's take on that and a lot more here.
[01:37:39.079 --> 01:37:46.348]  A little bit in the next hour, then we have another one of the Patriots joining us, who's been exposing the Clintons of settled rape cases, and Hillary Clinton covers up for it.
[01:37:46.949 --> 01:37:48.430]  But Roger Stone, first off...
[01:37:49.309 --> 01:37:53.332]  Before we get to your big data dump and your analysis of what you've been told is going to happen tonight.
[01:37:53.813 --> 01:37:54.633]  They could change things.
[01:37:55.414 --> 01:38:03.821]  First off, I don't know if you were able to hear it earlier, but I went over the data dump on the Clintons and the Sultan and the connections to Epstein.
[01:38:03.841 --> 01:38:07.264]  They're in mainstream media and the 20 plus flights, not just 16 now.
[01:38:07.825 --> 01:38:09.126]  And I remember you like a year ago.
[01:38:09.166 --> 01:38:11.127]  We got to find the clip because folks really pay attention to that.
[01:38:11.468 --> 01:38:17.253]  Drudge last week, you know, linked to you, bringing up Danny Williams, you know, six months or no, nine months ago before it was in the news.
[01:38:18.799 --> 01:38:21.641]  Bill Clinton's illegitimate son is saying that was going to be coming up.
[01:38:22.002 --> 01:38:29.467]  You said about the whole Epstein thing, and get ready, they've already failed at filing one fake lawsuit in Houston with fake names.
[01:38:29.507 --> 01:38:30.928]  Now they're going to file others.
[01:38:31.769 --> 01:38:32.990]  So this is unprecedented.
[01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:34.231]  You predicted all of this.
[01:38:34.251 --> 01:38:35.391]  I talked to you this morning at length.
[01:38:35.932 --> 01:38:38.314]  You said you weren't aware of all of it, but you knew it was coming.
[01:38:38.434 --> 01:38:45.239]  Since then, since I broke this yesterday, it's broken in a bunch of newspapers that a judge has now announced a date to hear this.
[01:38:46.328 --> 01:38:50.011]  So this is purely right up against the election when they won't have time to prove it either way.
[01:38:50.291 --> 01:38:55.255]  This is so obvious when the Clintons are the ones that hang out with this guy and he founded their foundation.
[01:38:55.435 --> 01:39:03.081]  I mean, am I barking up the wrong tree here or is this the most naked, sickening, over-the-top, deceptive October surprise in the history of the galaxy?
[01:39:04.262 --> 01:39:06.463]  No, Alex, I think you've got it about right.
[01:39:06.603 --> 01:39:09.426]  I mean, the Clintons know they have massive vulnerability.
[01:39:11.327 --> 01:39:14.970]  Jeffrey Epstein is a billionaire hedge fund manager friend of Bill.
[01:39:16.226 --> 01:39:24.686]  The Palm Beach County, uh, Palm Beach City Police determined that he has raped 33 underage girls between the ages of 13 and 17.
[01:39:26.713 --> 01:39:37.921]  We also know from the FAA records that Bill Clinton has been on Epstein's hedonistic private orgy island in the U.S.
[01:39:37.961 --> 01:39:38.701]  Virgin Islands.
[01:39:39.742 --> 01:39:55.593]  We know that Epstein has given $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation, although of course that doesn't show on their website where they claim they are engaging in full voluntary disclosure.
[01:39:56.890 --> 01:40:18.777]  Grizzlane Maxwell, who is essentially the pimp who goes out and recruits underage girls in bus stations and runaways for Epstein to assault, is given immunity in his prosecution and now works for a non-profit financed by the Clinton Foundation.
[01:40:19.518 --> 01:40:23.839]  She was present every time Bill was on Pido Island.
[01:40:25.158 --> 01:40:46.381]  We know that Epstein, a convicted pedophile, flew Bill Clinton, a suspected pedophile, to Brunei to collect a $2 million check for the Clinton Presidential Library from the Sultan of Brunei, a known pedophile who
[01:40:47.230 --> 01:40:52.414]  Is known to have a harem of both underage boys and girls.
[01:40:53.054 --> 01:40:55.216]  So what we have here is deflection.
[01:40:55.897 --> 01:40:58.659]  The Clintons know this lawsuit will never survive.
[01:40:59.139 --> 01:41:00.820]  They know it'll never even go to trial.
[01:41:01.481 --> 01:41:05.724]  So when people say to me, oh, you're accusing Bill of rape.
[01:41:05.764 --> 01:41:09.407]  What about the rape allegations against Trump?
[01:41:10.803 --> 01:41:17.185]  I say we know who's accused Clinton of rape, Juanita Broderick, and others.
[01:41:17.525 --> 01:41:23.926]  Sexual assault, Paula Jones, where Bill Clinton paid an $850,000 out-of-court settlement.
[01:41:24.826 --> 01:41:31.128]  But those bearing witness against Trump, I would say false witness, they're anonymous.
[01:41:31.648 --> 01:41:32.568]  Jane Doe.
[01:41:32.989 --> 01:41:34.209]  This has no credibility.
[01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:38.850]  If you want to accuse Donald Trump of rape in a legal forum,
[01:41:39.696 --> 01:41:43.119]  Put your name on it if you want to be taken seriously.
[01:41:43.719 --> 01:41:57.751]  Now, I've talked to the lawyers for the plaintiffs in the current pending Epstein case, in which some of the victims are seeking to overturn his slap on the wrist conviction.
[01:41:59.132 --> 01:42:02.514]  And they believe that these women do not exist.
[01:42:03.675 --> 01:42:07.919]  The lawyer who has represented them, at least represented them in Texas,
[01:42:08.866 --> 01:42:11.769]  Uses different names on the phone with different reporters.
[01:42:12.610 --> 01:42:16.554]  Appears to be an entertainment lawyer rather than having any expertise.
[01:42:16.614 --> 01:42:25.522]  Clearly an intelligence operation, a classic cutout with fake names right before the election to be able to create the whole illusion but then have it all fade away after the election.
[01:42:25.803 --> 01:42:26.583]  A total hoax.
[01:42:27.504 --> 01:42:36.291]  An outrageous smear to deflect the Clinton's very real- Let me ask you this, because you said this a year ago, and you said if Trump was to go serious, he would release this, he knew about it all.
[01:42:37.051 --> 01:42:42.095]  And you even predicted they would try to go after him instead, because we already heard rumblings and fake suits that were thrown out with fake names.
[01:42:42.556 --> 01:42:44.137]  Why didn't Trump go with this against him?
[01:42:45.623 --> 01:42:46.744]  It's an excellent question.
[01:42:47.104 --> 01:42:51.769]  I must say, many times I can't explain what the Trump campaign is doing.
[01:42:52.449 --> 01:42:55.012]  The best thing about the Trump campaign is Trump himself.
[01:42:55.032 --> 01:42:55.933]  Stay there.
[01:42:56.013 --> 01:43:00.677]  I'm going to come back to you to talk about this and then your info on what you have been told they're planning to do tonight.
[01:43:01.317 --> 01:43:02.418]  Stonecoldtruth.com.
[01:43:02.459 --> 01:43:03.199]  He's Roger Stone.
[01:43:03.219 --> 01:43:04.420]  We sell both of his best-selling books.
[01:43:04.741 --> 01:43:05.962]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:43:06.102 --> 01:43:06.542]  Stay with us.
[01:43:06.562 --> 01:43:07.023]  We'll be back.
[01:43:10.126 --> 01:43:20.315]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:43:20.875 --> 01:43:32.545]  And others who are kind of at the very fringe of the conspiracy movement like Alex Jones are being kind of incorporated into the campaign in ways it's a or even the recent choices of campaign management.
[01:43:32.845 --> 01:43:37.989]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle as we've been chronicling here.
[01:43:38.029 --> 01:43:39.070]  Jones is the show which
[01:43:39.370 --> 01:43:43.132]  Conspiracy theorist and creator of the fringe website InfoWars.
[01:43:43.512 --> 01:43:46.534]  Do you also know that Hillary Clinton uses a wheelchair?
[01:43:47.595 --> 01:43:53.658]  Her personal vehicle has had to be outfitted with a wheelchair lift because she is not a person who can actually walk.
[01:43:54.438 --> 01:43:57.520]  She secretly uses a wheelchair all those times you think you've seen her walking.
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:58.481]  She hasn't been walking.
[01:43:58.701 --> 01:43:59.221]  Did you know that?
[01:44:00.081 --> 01:44:03.023]  Hillary Clinton has been on the campaign trail for 18 months.
[01:44:03.103 --> 01:44:05.664]  Her energy staggers me.
[01:44:06.385 --> 01:44:07.946]  I have a hard time keeping up with her.
[01:44:12.432 --> 01:44:16.975]  The historical first in electing the first conspiracy freak president.
[01:44:17.235 --> 01:44:18.716]  He's not pivoting for presidential.
[01:44:18.956 --> 01:44:20.557]  He's pivoting to Alex Jones.
[01:44:20.597 --> 01:44:21.918]  He's pivoting to crazy.
[01:44:22.418 --> 01:44:26.961]  Was Hillary wearing an earpiece during last night's presidential forum?
[01:44:27.701 --> 01:44:36.987]  That is the pilot, the captain of America's conspiracy theory mothership, Alex Jones.
[01:44:37.007 --> 01:44:39.088]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you Alex?
[01:44:40.467 --> 01:44:41.648]  The plan was so simple.
[01:44:41.748 --> 01:44:46.092]  All Hillary had to do was open a jar of pickles, and the White House would be all ours.
[01:44:46.252 --> 01:44:48.594]  You're gonna be part of the conspiracy now, you realize that, right?
[01:44:48.614 --> 01:44:49.575]  I'm gonna try and do my best.
[01:44:49.755 --> 01:44:51.497]  Alex Jones is gonna be all over you!
[01:44:51.537 --> 01:44:52.277]  Let's see what happens.
[01:44:52.317 --> 01:44:53.138]  Okay, here we go.
[01:44:53.939 --> 01:44:54.419]  Here it is.
[01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:55.760]  Whoop Blitzer.
[01:44:56.521 --> 01:44:56.881]  Oh no!
[01:44:58.863 --> 01:45:05.549]  Oh, there was a... They're all in on this, on this total conspiracy theory that literally came from InfoWars.
[01:45:05.909 --> 01:45:07.791]  First of all, Hayes, I'll get you for this segment.
[01:45:08.706 --> 01:45:12.847]  It may take years and cost thousands of lives, but I'll get you for this.
[01:45:13.207 --> 01:45:23.010]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[01:45:24.270 --> 01:45:26.371]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[01:45:29.612 --> 01:45:32.592]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:45:32.612 --> 01:45:34.653]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:45:35.093 --> 01:45:37.914]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:45:38.914 --> 01:45:42.437]  And it matters, because it's not just the Kook Fringe.
[01:45:42.477 --> 01:45:48.961]  It's not just the sort of remunerative conspiracy theory world of that part of the conservative media machine.
[01:45:49.242 --> 01:45:54.205]  It's not even just wacky people who have made their way into Republican politics at a surprising height.
[01:45:54.445 --> 01:45:56.207]  This is now the top of the Republican ticket.
[01:46:08.672 --> 01:46:11.693]  Coming to a city near you, ISIS serial killers!
[01:46:11.993 --> 01:46:18.754]  That's right, an ISIS magazine, Rumaya, is recruiting serial killers to carry out knife attacks in the West.
[01:46:18.994 --> 01:46:28.155]  This hate group, or religion of peace according to Hillary Clinton, explains to potential recruits how they don't need a gun to terrorize innocent people, they just need a knife!
[01:46:28.556 --> 01:46:34.097]  This same publication also calls for its servants to shed blood and even to die for their cause.
[01:46:34.337 --> 01:46:35.477]  How would you describe that?
[01:46:35.777 --> 01:46:36.637]  Radical Islam?
[01:46:36.937 --> 01:46:41.040]  I'm sure Barack Obama will be ignoring this because radical Islam doesn't exist to him.
[01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:47.145]  I'm sure Hillary Clinton will turn a blind eye to this as well as she doesn't want to offend anyone on the eve of an election.
[01:46:47.405 --> 01:46:48.526]  Here's a crazy idea.
[01:46:48.866 --> 01:46:54.751]  Find out whoever is publishing this mass murderer producing hate rag and start questioning him and his entire staff.
[01:46:55.031 --> 01:46:58.634]  It's okay to assume it's a man as they're in charge of women in radical Islam.
[01:46:58.934 --> 01:47:03.155]  Then jail him or start getting some answers on ISIS leaders immediately.
[01:47:03.395 --> 01:47:05.356]  Or are we really that incompetent?
[01:47:05.516 --> 01:47:08.077]  This is Owen Schroer from InfoWars.com.
[01:47:12.778 --> 01:47:15.399]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:30.583 --> 01:47:34.026]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:47:34.646 --> 01:47:36.548]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:36.568 --> 01:47:39.170]  We have seen historical levels of corruption.
[01:47:39.731 --> 01:47:42.193]  The Clintons sell us out to foreign interests with the Bushes.
[01:47:42.793 --> 01:47:47.317]  The powerful old corrupt dynasty rejected by the voters in the Republican primary.
[01:47:48.258 --> 01:47:57.165]  The Republican establishment throwing everything they've got against Trump for some jocular, you know, talk 11 years ago being set up, highly edited.
[01:47:57.185 --> 01:47:59.307]  I'm not going to even defend the talk.
[01:48:00.185 --> 01:48:10.008]  But compared to taking us to war, backing Al Qaeda, selling out our jobs, Bill Clinton selling secrets, Hillary doing it, covering it all up, it is nothing.
[01:48:11.249 --> 01:48:18.711]  And to see the mainstream media act like this is the end of the world, and all these Republican leaders that are total neocons acting like, oh, now they're settling against Trump.
[01:48:18.731 --> 01:48:19.672]  They were always against him.
[01:48:20.552 --> 01:48:22.973]  Then their constituents forced them to hold their nose.
[01:48:24.568 --> 01:48:26.629]  So regardless, the power structure's really scared.
[01:48:27.149 --> 01:48:29.791]  I think Trump needs to come out, guns blazing politically tonight.
[01:48:29.811 --> 01:48:32.452]  I think he needs to go for the jugular or he's in deep trouble.
[01:48:33.232 --> 01:48:34.373]  Roger, what do you think you should do?
[01:48:34.993 --> 01:48:39.435]  And then a former campaign head for Trump, and then obviously we've got a clip we're going to play coming up.
[01:48:39.475 --> 01:48:40.396]  We start the next hour.
[01:48:40.416 --> 01:48:42.417]  It's a two-minute statement.
[01:48:42.437 --> 01:48:53.022]  You'll be able to continue here with your analysis, but the ten minutes we have right now, what should Trump do, A, and then B, you've got some big breaking news that I want to get into this hour when we have a lot of stations carrying us.
[01:48:54.481 --> 01:49:00.547]  On what you were told by a high-level source is going to happen tonight at this debate that kicks off in two hours and 15 minutes.
[01:49:02.048 --> 01:49:08.254]  Well, Alex, Hillary Clinton is going to start the debate by refusing to shake Donald Trump's hand.
[01:49:09.275 --> 01:49:17.322]  After which, Anderson Cooper will give her the first question, which will be, why did you decide not to shake Donald Trump's hand?
[01:49:18.050 --> 01:49:36.238]  Giving her the open for an attack on Trump that relates to this tape incident, which is a distraction from the scandal-style gutter politics of the Clintons, the rotten record of corruption
[01:49:36.978 --> 01:49:43.023]  And the policy failures of Bill and Hillary Clinton that have brought the country to its knees.
[01:49:43.063 --> 01:49:43.964]  Sure, so let's get into this.
[01:49:43.984 --> 01:49:44.725]  You were told this again.
[01:49:44.765 --> 01:49:46.286]  Repeat to me what you told me earlier.
[01:49:46.306 --> 01:49:47.527]  I mean, this is huge.
[01:49:48.268 --> 01:49:49.949]  I mean, specifically what you were told.
[01:49:49.989 --> 01:49:51.370]  This is obviously a stage zinger.
[01:49:52.011 --> 01:49:53.412]  How do you think Trump will respond?
[01:49:53.492 --> 01:49:56.755]  Or by us talking about it hours before, might they back off?
[01:49:56.955 --> 01:49:57.475]  Roger Stone.
[01:49:58.696 --> 01:50:05.602]  Well, a very high level source in the Clinton camp doesn't perhaps realize that they have a leak.
[01:50:06.286 --> 01:50:11.191]  But Hillary, again, will open the debate by refusing to shake Trump's hand.
[01:50:12.612 --> 01:50:27.006]  And Anderson Cooper will then direct his first question to Hillary, giving her a forum to launch a personal attack on Trump regarding extraneous issues of 10 years ago.
[01:50:28.749 --> 01:50:39.574]  In order to deflect from the corruption, the poor health, the policy failures, and the bully boy tactics of the Clintons.
[01:50:40.554 --> 01:50:52.039]  Now that Trump knows about this stratagem, I have no doubt that he will be well prepared for it in any number of ways.
[01:50:52.659 --> 01:50:56.321]  Trump, being a gentleman, should shake Hillary's hand.
[01:50:57.168 --> 01:51:21.384]  Despite the fact that she has virtually raped the people of Haiti, that she has raped the people of Libya, that she and her husband have lined their pockets with millions in their phony charity scam, the fact that her husband is a sexual predator, and that Hillary herself
[01:51:22.210 --> 01:51:32.015]  has orchestrated the terror campaign to bully and intimidate her husband's sexual assault victims into silence.
[01:51:32.835 --> 01:51:48.503]  You know, Alex, there's an incredible piece in today's New York Post in which the veteran Republican campaign consultant, Ed Rollins, offers Donald Trump and his campaign six things they must do to get the campaign on track.
[01:51:49.446 --> 01:52:05.133]  What's historic about this piece is, Rollins is wrong about every single point that he makes, including that Trump should not bring up the issue of Bill Clinton's infidelities.
[01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:08.021]  His indiscretions.
[01:52:08.481 --> 01:52:10.822]  Could we please get this straight one more time?
[01:52:11.902 --> 01:52:14.363]  The issue is not the Clinton's marriage.
[01:52:14.823 --> 01:52:19.385]  It's the brutal, vicious raping and biting of women.
[01:52:19.885 --> 01:52:23.326]  And can't Trump see that he knew about Epstein and all this?
[01:52:23.346 --> 01:52:24.366]  We knew this was coming.
[01:52:24.666 --> 01:52:25.967]  He should have attacked earlier.
[01:52:25.987 --> 01:52:29.348]  Now they launch it so it just sounds like he's counterattacking now.
[01:52:30.518 --> 01:52:32.820]  Well, look, Trump is not a career politician.
[01:52:34.081 --> 01:52:42.186]  And while he has a few good people around him, he's got many a boarding party from the Ted Cruz camp.
[01:52:42.726 --> 01:52:45.829]  And I don't see the depth of political experience there.
[01:52:45.849 --> 01:52:52.974]  Now, I'm a big fan of Steve Bannon, because like you and I, Alex, you know, he can think outside the box.
[01:52:53.434 --> 01:52:56.376]  He understands who the bad guys are, the globalists.
[01:52:57.376 --> 01:53:02.679]  He has published some of the best research on the Clinton's crimes across the board.
[01:53:02.699 --> 01:53:16.046]  The sex crimes, the Clinton Foundation crimes, the policy crimes that have left the Middle East a smoldering, smoking wreckage, refugees, crime, and death.
[01:53:16.866 --> 01:53:22.829]  So I'm a Bannon fan, but only Donald Trump will decide what tactics he will use tonight.
[01:53:23.759 --> 01:53:36.523]  And I think in a certain sense, historically, as you know, the audience for the debate, the second debate, drops dramatically from the first, traditionally.
[01:53:37.224 --> 01:53:44.846]  Because of this tape incident, Donald Trump's audience tonight, I think, will be larger than the first debate.
[01:53:45.566 --> 01:53:50.468]  So here is an opportunity to score that may be unprecedented.
[01:53:51.784 --> 01:54:00.930]  I don't want to say he's doomed with 29 days out if he doesn't absolutely have a brutal coup de grace, but now is the time to both barrels to say this is outrageous hypocrisy.
[01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:05.513]  Don't interrupt me, Anderson Cooper, like the last debater did 40-something times, her six times.
[01:54:06.133 --> 01:54:07.234]  Stop turning my mic off.
[01:54:07.254 --> 01:54:08.494]  The debate commission admitted they did it.
[01:54:08.775 --> 01:54:09.555]  Don't rig this.
[01:54:10.075 --> 01:54:12.037]  Stop scamming me and the American people.
[01:54:12.357 --> 01:54:13.317]  Your fraud is over.
[01:54:13.337 --> 01:54:15.379]  I think you should just tear into Hillary Clinton.
[01:54:16.363 --> 01:54:18.144]  Well, look, I've got to hand it to the Clinton campaign.
[01:54:18.604 --> 01:54:24.148]  These folks have run numerous presidential campaigns, and they are skillful at creating diversionary non-issues, such as Miss Venezuela.
[01:54:44.795 --> 01:54:51.061]  I would caution Trump and the Trump supporters not to get into a discussion on extraneous issues.
[01:54:51.161 --> 01:55:00.729]  Stay focused on the policy failures and record of corruption and the sexual assaults and cover-ups of the Clintons.
[01:55:02.331 --> 01:55:06.915]  Trade, immigration, jobs, and most importantly, war.
[01:55:06.975 --> 01:55:11.699]  Because Alex, we are hurtling towards war with the Russians.
[01:55:12.777 --> 01:55:15.539]  We are provoking the Russians.
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:31.492]  We are inserting ourselves in Syria in which neither Assad and his Russian patrons or ISIS and their Saudi patrons are friends of ours.
[01:55:32.393 --> 01:55:37.760]  Why would we spend American blood and treasure in such a war?
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:40.403]  Well, the Democrats want to win an election.
[01:55:40.443 --> 01:55:44.668]  If we have to go to war with Russia, that will be the cost.
[01:55:48.493 --> 01:55:50.336]  This is mad dog behavior.
[01:56:06.088 --> 01:56:08.269]  Calling for a no-fly zone is madness.
[01:56:08.989 --> 01:56:10.069]  It's just madness.
[01:56:10.529 --> 01:56:17.752]  The AWACS that the Russians now have here are superior to anybody else can bring to the theater.
[01:56:18.432 --> 01:56:20.632]  This could spark World War III.
[01:56:21.233 --> 01:56:26.654]  But as long as Hillary gets elected, of course, that would be okay with the Obama administration.
[01:56:27.214 --> 01:56:32.736]  I was on a panel the other day with Max Boot, formerly of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:56:33.176 --> 01:56:35.317]  He's salivating for war.
[01:56:36.153 --> 01:56:37.464]  He also told the audience...
[01:56:38.464 --> 01:56:39.685]  Creating his own reality.
[01:56:39.705 --> 01:56:40.946]  Everything's great in America.
[01:57:08.524 --> 01:57:11.747]  Where I watched Congress two weeks ago going, just shoot down the Russian airplanes with missiles.
[01:57:11.767 --> 01:57:13.208]  They go, but then they'll attack our pilots.
[01:57:13.468 --> 01:57:14.910]  But the missiles don't have pilots on them.
[01:57:15.070 --> 01:57:17.492]  The point is they're going to attack our ships off the shore.
[01:57:17.512 --> 01:57:19.293]  Like, Congress is insane.
[01:57:19.574 --> 01:57:20.354]  Not just the Democrats.
[01:57:20.374 --> 01:57:24.818]  These are insane people with all these crazy right-wing neocons running Hillary and Obama.
[01:57:25.119 --> 01:57:26.420]  What the hell's wrong with the left?
[01:57:27.418 --> 01:57:28.800]  Yeah, it's really extraordinary.
[01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:32.364]  Donald Trump is the peace candidate in this race.
[01:57:32.824 --> 01:57:36.328]  Donald Trump favors a period... Well, that's why we got this leak from a high-level Democrat.
[01:57:36.349 --> 01:57:38.331]  I mean, people that have brains are really freaking out.
[01:57:38.371 --> 01:57:40.834]  It's like Hillary, you know, has an H in her name for a reason.
[01:57:40.854 --> 01:57:41.414]  She's Hitler-y.
[01:57:41.795 --> 01:57:44.778]  We're gonna be back in 70 seconds to start the third hour.
[01:57:44.798 --> 01:57:45.019]  We only...
[01:57:45.399 --> 01:57:46.541]  Normally we do two hours on Sunday.
[01:57:46.561 --> 01:57:48.204]  We're going to go right past 10 o'clock tonight.
[01:57:48.244 --> 01:57:48.965]  The debate's coming up.
[01:57:49.165 --> 01:57:49.866]  We're covering it all.
[01:57:49.927 --> 01:57:51.629]  InfoAwards.com forward slash show.
[01:57:51.850 --> 01:57:55.235]  If your station stops carrying us a minute, InfoAwards.com forward slash show.
[01:57:55.696 --> 01:57:56.177]  Stay with us.
[01:57:56.237 --> 01:57:57.980]  I'm Alex Jones and we'll be back with Roger Stone.

[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:03.361]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[01:58:20.408 --> 01:58:21.128]  The reality is
[01:58:21.408 --> 01:58:25.894]  It's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[01:58:26.215 --> 01:58:33.765]  Zika 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[01:58:34.006 --> 01:58:38.432]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.

[01:58:59.022 --> 01:59:00.023]  BrainForce is here.
[01:59:00.563 --> 01:59:02.845]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:59:03.105 --> 01:59:10.911]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:59:11.707 --> 01:59:15.290]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[01:59:15.310 --> 01:59:17.652]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[01:59:18.012 --> 01:59:21.535]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[01:59:21.575 --> 01:59:24.717]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[01:59:25.217 --> 01:59:30.401]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[01:59:30.542 --> 01:59:32.383]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[01:59:32.723 --> 01:59:37.167]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[01:59:37.307 --> 01:59:39.328]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[01:59:39.949 --> 01:59:41.410]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[01:59:41.550 --> 01:59:41.810]  Exactly.
[01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:45.631]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[01:59:46.111 --> 01:59:53.374]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:59:53.614 --> 01:59:55.314]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:14.949 --> 02:00:18.513]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:00:18.793 --> 02:00:20.094]  In the heart of the resistance.
[02:00:27.281 --> 02:00:28.943]  In the heart of the resistance.
[02:00:30.364 --> 02:00:31.446]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.866 --> 02:00:32.847]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:00:32.867 --> 02:00:34.529]  In about 15 minutes I'm going to go to break.
[02:00:35.708 --> 02:00:36.649]  And we've got our next guest on.
[02:00:36.669 --> 02:00:38.170]  I'm going to move into the TV studios.
[02:00:38.190 --> 02:00:42.493]  We're going to be there for at least three, four hours covering the debate that is in two hours.
[02:00:43.014 --> 02:00:48.598]  And afterwards, our analysis with David Knightley and McAdoo, Darren McBreen, Rob Dew.
[02:00:48.638 --> 02:00:51.000]  We've got Kit Daniels here, Raquel Thelen.
[02:00:51.581 --> 02:00:57.906]  So many other great people working on this Sunday night with our smaller crew to bring you this information.
[02:00:59.056 --> 02:01:00.816]  We're pretty much commercial free for the evening.
[02:01:01.196 --> 02:01:05.937]  We'll have some promos, we'll have some breaks, we'll have some news pieces, but we're pretty much commercial free.
[02:01:07.378 --> 02:01:10.738]  I will take time here and there to remind folks that we're listener supported.
[02:01:10.779 --> 02:01:16.120]  We're running a special 23% off on our flagship nutraceutical supplement, DNA Force.
[02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:23.581]  Find out what it does for your mitochondria, your cells, the ultimate antioxidant combination, 23% off on that product.
[02:01:24.201 --> 02:01:26.742]  We also have our new Biome Defense Probiotic.
[02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:30.283]  We have it with 25 billion live and active cultures.
[02:01:30.663 --> 02:01:33.746]  That's half the price than 50 billion live and active cultures.
[02:01:34.967 --> 02:01:39.952]  Two different sizes but the exact same formulation.
[02:01:40.332 --> 02:01:41.433]  That funds this operation.
[02:01:41.493 --> 02:01:42.854]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:01:43.275 --> 02:01:51.102]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site where you'll find the Bill Clinton rape shirt and where you'll also find the Hillary for prison shirt that in 29 days
[02:01:52.688 --> 02:01:53.589]  We're gonna stop selling it.
[02:01:53.609 --> 02:01:56.053]  We may have a few left and then it's discounted, but that's it.
[02:01:56.473 --> 02:02:02.322]  It's been our best-selling t-shirt ever, even more than the Obama Joker shirt we designed that started that whole meme.
[02:02:03.971 --> 02:02:05.472]  This is our best-selling shirt ever.
[02:02:05.492 --> 02:02:06.733]  A lot of them we've sold at cost.
[02:02:06.753 --> 02:02:07.374]  That's one reason.
[02:02:07.914 --> 02:02:09.216]  But it does help fund our operation.
[02:02:09.376 --> 02:02:11.137]  Having a $100,000 contest is not cheap.
[02:02:12.198 --> 02:02:14.500]  The thing that's really expensive is that they come after me.
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:21.667]  Believe me, it's really dangerous to punch a snarling, psychotic, rabies-infested creature like Hillary in the nose.
[02:02:22.187 --> 02:02:23.148]  But she's attacking us.
[02:02:23.508 --> 02:02:26.511]  She's sending people to Trump rallies to pose as racists and attackers.
[02:02:26.771 --> 02:02:27.572]  That's come out in the emails.
[02:02:27.872 --> 02:02:30.655]  So turnabout is fair in love and war.
[02:02:31.530 --> 02:02:34.511]  We're just doing something much more peaceful, just exposing he has a criminal rape record.
[02:02:34.831 --> 02:02:43.033]  I'm glad we launched this a week and a half ago ahead of them claiming, you know, that Trump's this big pervert and rapist and pedophile with no evidence, when Bill Clinton's flying around on Epstein's rape plane.
[02:02:43.393 --> 02:02:46.414]  So finishing up with Roger Stone here of the StoneColdTruth.com.
[02:02:47.754 --> 02:02:52.035]  We sell both his Bill Clinton's and Hillary Clinton's war on women and the Clinton, uh,
[02:02:52.912 --> 02:02:56.554]  Crime history being exposed, as well as the book that accompanies it, the Bush crime family.
[02:02:56.814 --> 02:03:05.240]  To have the Bushes endorsing them, and to have them calling them family, and the Republican rhinos coming out and saying, we're not for Trump now, but ignoring all the crimes of Clinton.
[02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:06.400]  It's so transparent.
[02:03:06.721 --> 02:03:08.762]  The establishment is against Trump.
[02:03:09.022 --> 02:03:09.943]  So let's speak to that.
[02:03:10.563 --> 02:03:12.624]  Let's also speak to what you expect to come next.
[02:03:13.124 --> 02:03:21.708]  If Trump follows his own gut and other people's advice, and not some of the other people's advice that want him to be sweetsie cake, they've got to know he got betrayed, he got set up.
[02:03:21.748 --> 02:03:25.490]  We know Hillary threw in a meteor, he's promised the daughters and stuff, be nice.
[02:03:25.850 --> 02:03:26.630]  We won't go there.
[02:03:26.650 --> 02:03:27.671]  She stabbed him in the back.
[02:03:28.571 --> 02:03:30.692]  I mean, I hope to God he gives it to her with both barrels.
[02:03:30.972 --> 02:03:32.373]  What would you advise Trump to do?
[02:03:32.633 --> 02:03:33.233]  You've got the floor.
[02:03:33.253 --> 02:03:34.234]  I'm going to give you 10 minutes right now.
[02:03:35.635 --> 02:04:01.233]  Well, I noticed in the New York Times, in their story regarding the video that the Trump campaign released in which the candidate sought to put his comments in the now famous Billy Bush tape, which may in fact have been doctored and kind of re-sliced, which I find curious, that at least one of
[02:04:02.091 --> 02:04:14.937]  Mr. Trump's advisors, Donald's advisors, told him that if he mentioned the Clintons in his statement, the statement would be ineffective and it would be a failure.
[02:04:16.117 --> 02:04:18.518]  This is about as wrongheaded as I can think.
[02:04:18.578 --> 02:04:23.841]  In fact, finally, we got the proper focus on the issue, which as I've said before,
[02:04:24.682 --> 02:04:36.234]  Is not infidelity or adultery or girlfriends or mistresses, but something far darker and more sinister, sexual assault and rape.
[02:04:36.794 --> 02:04:43.521]  Trump very effectively counterpunched when he essentially said, look, maybe it wasn't a great choice of words.
[02:04:44.962 --> 02:04:48.506]  You know, let's compare my words to their deeds.
[02:04:49.249 --> 02:04:51.971]  Let's compare my words to their actions.
[02:04:52.852 --> 02:05:00.718]  Now, finally, perhaps, we're going to have this exchange, which I think can have a profound impact among women voters.
[02:05:03.908 --> 02:05:08.651]  When I say I'm giving you the floor, brother, that's it, because if I keep my mic on, I'll interrupt you constantly.
[02:05:08.931 --> 02:05:11.953]  But because you paused, let me play this clip now since you mentioned it.
[02:05:12.674 --> 02:05:14.135]  This is Donald Trump's apology.
[02:05:14.195 --> 02:05:15.116]  I think it was spot on.
[02:05:15.496 --> 02:05:16.396]  Hey, I've grown a lot.
[02:05:16.596 --> 02:05:18.338]  I was behind the scenes 11 years ago.
[02:05:18.778 --> 02:05:20.339]  You know, he said, I've never claimed to be perfect.
[02:05:20.359 --> 02:05:22.560]  He's never claimed like he was some lily white guy.
[02:05:22.641 --> 02:05:23.461]  He's not covered it up.
[02:05:23.501 --> 02:05:24.682]  It's why, to me, I just don't care.
[02:05:24.702 --> 02:05:27.524]  I mean, quite frankly, he doesn't want America to be sold out.
[02:05:27.804 --> 02:05:28.645]  The globalists know it.
[02:05:28.965 --> 02:05:29.685]  He's a nationalist.
[02:05:29.705 --> 02:05:33.548]  He's got great generals advising him that exposed our government's working with ISIS and al Qaeda.
[02:05:34.048 --> 02:05:35.409]  I mean, I'm more Donald Trump than ever.
[02:05:35.449 --> 02:05:42.095]  The more he gets embattled, the more hyenas turn against him, the more rats turn against him, the more Republican snot-noses turn against him, the more I'm for him.
[02:05:42.315 --> 02:05:43.576]  That's what Democrats should know.
[02:05:43.636 --> 02:05:45.197]  You had it stolen from Bernie Sanders.
[02:05:46.358 --> 02:05:47.880]  You watched yourselves robbed.
[02:05:48.881 --> 02:05:49.941]  Trump's still gonna win.
[02:05:50.322 --> 02:05:51.363]  Maybe not a landslide.
[02:05:51.583 --> 02:05:54.725]  They want a perception he lost so they can steal it.
[02:05:55.086 --> 02:05:56.707]  All they're wanting is plausibility.
[02:05:57.047 --> 02:06:00.750]  So let's go to a little two-minute clip of him Friday night responding.
[02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:01.091]  Here it is.
[02:06:02.898 --> 02:06:06.921]  I've never said I'm a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I'm not.
[02:06:07.521 --> 02:06:14.486]  I've said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them.
[02:06:15.147 --> 02:06:19.329]  Anyone who knows me knows these words don't reflect who I am.
[02:06:20.010 --> 02:06:23.392]  I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize.
[02:06:24.033 --> 02:06:26.855]  I've traveled the country talking about change for America.
[02:06:27.355 --> 02:06:29.537]  But my travels have also changed me.
[02:06:30.118 --> 02:06:40.927]  I've spent time with grieving mothers who've lost their children, laid-off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future.
[02:06:41.628 --> 02:06:47.253]  I have gotten to know the great people of our country, and I've been humbled by the faith they've placed in me.
[02:06:47.813 --> 02:06:52.538]  I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and will never, ever let you down.
[02:06:53.198 --> 02:06:54.039]  Let's be honest.
[02:06:54.479 --> 02:06:55.881]  We're living in the real world.
[02:06:56.321 --> 02:07:00.785]  This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we're facing today.
[02:07:01.385 --> 02:07:07.871]  We're losing our jobs, we're less safe than we were eight years ago, and Washington is totally broken.
[02:07:08.372 --> 02:07:11.815]  Hillary Clinton and her kind have run our country into the ground.
[02:07:12.495 --> 02:07:18.717]  I've said some foolish things, but there's a big difference between the words and actions of other people.
[02:07:19.177 --> 02:07:26.159]  Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed, and intimidated his victims.
[02:07:26.699 --> 02:07:29.020]  We will discuss this more in the coming days.
[02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:31.441]  See you at the debate on Sunday.
[02:07:43.328 --> 02:07:49.513]  Well, you're exactly right, Alex, about the fact that those Republicans who have headed to the tall grass were never for him to begin with.
[02:07:50.815 --> 02:07:59.382]  And those who bitterly opposed his nomination, the never Trumpers, are helping promulgate this myth.
[02:08:01.398 --> 02:08:11.082]  I thought that was very effective, particularly at the end, to try to refocus the campaign on the crimes and the failures of the Clintons.
[02:08:11.802 --> 02:08:19.465]  And if he can continue in that vein tonight, with an enormous television audience, this race is still imminently winnable.
[02:08:20.425 --> 02:08:27.548]  The Sunshine Soldiers today were ready to jump out the windows, saying three weeks before an election, this is over.
[02:08:28.268 --> 02:08:28.488]  Over!
[02:08:29.634 --> 02:08:32.076]  Nothing's over till we say it is.
[02:08:33.276 --> 02:08:35.117]  This is total mind control.
[02:08:35.138 --> 02:08:37.999]  You have Bill Clinton on the rapist plane 20 something times.
[02:08:38.239 --> 02:08:40.821]  You have him flying to the pedophile Sultan's house.
[02:08:41.101 --> 02:08:42.762]  You have him settling rape cases.
[02:08:42.962 --> 02:08:44.824]  You've got Jane Doe made up crap.
[02:08:45.184 --> 02:08:49.647]  You've got this stupid thing and the media is all hoaxing it like the media has lost its power.
[02:08:50.367 --> 02:08:56.250]  But always after the fact, like Obamacare is free, or all these other lies, or we don't want your guns, but we are going to ban them.
[02:08:56.570 --> 02:09:01.672]  And now they're saying, it's all over, it's all over, it's over for Trump, it's over, it's over, it's over, it's over.
[02:09:02.032 --> 02:09:08.975]  When Hillary, I almost want them to just steal the election and put Hillary in, because she's falling apart, everybody hates her, and I'm just sick of this crap.
[02:09:08.995 --> 02:09:17.439]  Because once she doesn't have Donald Trump to stick her evil demon witch finger at, that damn witch is going to melt like the witch when a big bucket of water got thrown on her.
[02:09:19.011 --> 02:09:21.189]  So I guess I can put you down as undecided.
[02:09:22.979 --> 02:09:24.640]  I think you just summed it up, Alex.
[02:09:25.101 --> 02:09:35.307]  The mainstream media is apoplectic and they are working hand in glove with the Clinton campaign and the Democrats to create this false narrative.
[02:09:35.768 --> 02:09:49.817]  We've yet to see a poll, an authoritative poll, that shows any substantial shift in the electorate after this unprecedented, carefully orchestrated, planted attack on Trump.
[02:09:50.397 --> 02:09:54.120]  I don't think you'll have a shift of more than three or four percent of the vote.
[02:09:54.580 --> 02:09:58.283]  I was about to say, we even have a Gallup poll where he hadn't even lost half a point in two days by this.
[02:09:58.343 --> 02:10:02.545]  I mean, I think pretty much people are decided and I think most people are like closeted.
[02:10:02.625 --> 02:10:04.587]  I think some of the internal Trump folks are right.
[02:10:04.607 --> 02:10:07.549]  There's five, ten points of people that are scared to say they're for Trump.
[02:10:07.609 --> 02:10:08.870]  I mean, I think he's going to win a landslide.
[02:10:09.150 --> 02:10:13.713]  What about my statement, they're only preparing us for plausibility when Homeland Security steals it.
[02:10:14.636 --> 02:10:18.499]  Yeah, this is the most outrageous single claim of the week.
[02:10:18.659 --> 02:10:33.592]  The Homeland Security cabinet member, secretary, and I believe one of the assistant directors of the anti-terrorism effects, come out publicly and say they're concerned that the Russians will hack the election.
[02:10:34.415 --> 02:10:36.816]  They're reading the Clinton campaign talking points.
[02:10:36.977 --> 02:10:37.897]  They have no evidence.
[02:10:38.017 --> 02:10:43.000]  If they have evidence, send it to the Republicans on the Intelligence Committee.
[02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:47.703]  They're qualified to see classified information.
[02:10:47.723 --> 02:10:48.023]  That's right.
[02:10:48.063 --> 02:10:48.684]  I mean, I forgot.
[02:10:48.704 --> 02:10:55.327]  They've now officially come out and said Putin is jacking the elections with no proof, and they won't release it, and they won't tell Congress.
[02:10:55.648 --> 02:10:59.710]  I mean, this looks like an internal coup already happening 29 days out, Roger.
[02:10:59.730 --> 02:11:00.771]  So what do we do?
[02:11:01.531 --> 02:11:06.434]  Well, if I were the Republican Congress, I would challenge those two officials.
[02:11:06.674 --> 02:11:11.577]  No, they're too busy saying Trump should step down because he had locker room talk and said he, you know, likes women.
[02:11:12.922 --> 02:11:17.626]  Vote the articles of impeachment in the House and convict him in the Senate.
[02:11:17.826 --> 02:11:18.747]  The man's lying!
[02:11:19.007 --> 02:11:23.611]  There's no evidence the Russians are hacking the... Jay Johnson's a liar!
[02:11:23.711 --> 02:11:25.793]  We've been hacked by the New World Order!
[02:11:25.993 --> 02:11:27.414]  We're run by foreign banks!
[02:11:27.875 --> 02:11:35.601]  Did you see the Secretary of the Army, General Milley, came out on Monday, we played it all week long, and he actually says, you think Russia pulled out?
[02:11:35.982 --> 02:11:37.483]  You think the EU's gonna fall apart?
[02:11:37.743 --> 02:11:38.824]  You think Brexit'll happen?
[02:11:39.184 --> 02:11:41.046]  We'll hit you harder than you've ever been hit!
[02:11:41.346 --> 02:11:46.029]  He's saying to the patriots worldwide that when out of the New World Order, they're going to hit us.
[02:11:46.489 --> 02:11:49.271]  I mean, this is... Meanwhile, they had to fire all the generals.
[02:11:49.611 --> 02:11:58.297]  Meanwhile, we have a patriot like General Flynn, former head of Army Intelligence and Army Intelligence, period, Defense Intelligence, saying, we've been taken over by multinationals.
[02:11:58.337 --> 02:11:59.578]  This is Lexington Concord.
[02:11:59.838 --> 02:12:00.958]  Let's take America back.
[02:12:01.299 --> 02:12:07.703]  Meanwhile, this traitor is up there literally saying, you try to pull out, we'll hit you harder than you've ever been hit.
[02:12:08.904 --> 02:12:12.147]  It reminded me of the Nuremberg rallies.
[02:12:12.607 --> 02:12:13.628]  It had that feeling.
[02:12:14.208 --> 02:12:26.878]  The other thing that I think is going very well here is because the mainstream media refuses to cover the rape narrative, our t-shirts are popping up everywhere.
[02:12:27.438 --> 02:12:46.817]  I was about to say, how would you, because it was a Friday and a half ago, it was like a week and a half ago, we had the idea, I had the idea on air, I said they're blocking the rape allegations, they're blocking the rape settlements, I said that's it Roger, everybody's going to wear your shirts in public, and to make it fun, get it in public for five seconds on national TV, a thousand, get raped out multiple times on air that you believe he's committed a crime, so that's your view, five thousand dollars.
[02:12:47.097 --> 02:12:48.819]  I'm down to twenty-five thousand I'm going to pay out.
[02:12:49.079 --> 02:12:50.901]  I'll pay out the $100,000 even though it hurts our budget.
[02:12:50.921 --> 02:12:51.401]  I'm gonna do it.
[02:12:51.421 --> 02:12:52.643]  I just sent checks out Friday.
[02:12:53.083 --> 02:12:56.166]  And I've got more guests coming up later after you leave us who have actually done this as well.
[02:12:56.607 --> 02:12:58.268]  I mean, this could really domino.
[02:12:58.289 --> 02:12:59.750]  This could really snowball.
[02:13:00.170 --> 02:13:02.253]  How would you grade the success of this right now?
[02:13:02.473 --> 02:13:06.577]  Just as an exercise of cyber-jamming the New World Order.
[02:13:06.597 --> 02:13:07.498]  This is beyond hacking.
[02:13:07.718 --> 02:13:09.240]  This is live media hacking.
[02:13:10.270 --> 02:13:15.334]  You know, Alex, I've always had a very high regard for guerrilla warfare, and that's exactly what this is.
[02:13:15.755 --> 02:13:28.906]  If the punks at CNN, who, by the way, edited Anna Navarro's epic meltdown on TV... Yeah, we just found that Anna Navarro, when she starts screaming pussy over and over again, I forgot to tell you that, Anna Navarro's... In fact, describe that.
[02:13:30.067 --> 02:13:35.252]  Yeah, she is asked about Trump's comments, and she flips out.
[02:13:35.985 --> 02:13:42.150]  And when she's challenged by Trump's surrogate to clean up her language, she starts screaming at the top of her lungs, PUSSY!
[02:13:42.250 --> 02:13:42.731]  PUSSY!
[02:13:42.831 --> 02:13:43.211]  PUSSY!
[02:13:43.291 --> 02:13:43.671]  PUSSY!
[02:13:43.872 --> 02:13:45.213]  And they cut to a commercial.
[02:13:45.273 --> 02:13:50.217]  Now, when you go to the archived version of the show, they've edited that out.
[02:13:50.757 --> 02:13:51.398]  CNN.
[02:13:51.738 --> 02:13:53.139]  Not a news organization.
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:55.221]  An opinion journal.
[02:13:55.341 --> 02:13:58.163]  Oh, they even edit Obama and Hillary speeches when they make a mistake.
[02:13:58.243 --> 02:13:58.824]  They take it out.
[02:13:59.864 --> 02:14:15.789]  Yeah, it's really extraordinary and quite clearly now with, as you pointed out, Rick Hulme, the former Jack Anderson white man, reading word-for-word verbatim talking points from Media Matters for America,
[02:14:16.704 --> 02:14:19.465]  The coup d'etat is complete at Fox.
[02:14:19.545 --> 02:14:22.325]  They are no longer fair and balanced.
[02:14:22.705 --> 02:14:26.426]  They're another cheerleader for the Clinton campaign.
[02:14:26.486 --> 02:14:30.047]  Now, there's a few folks there that I still like, and I think are patriots.
[02:14:30.107 --> 02:14:34.408]  Sean Hannity, Judge Andrew Napolitano, Judge Jeanine Pirro.
[02:14:35.108 --> 02:14:44.390]  But the red bears, those who were following the general, fair, balanced, objective
[02:14:45.527 --> 02:14:49.671]  Standard of Fox before the Roger Ailes coup.
[02:14:50.371 --> 02:14:53.034]  They're now quizlings for Rupert Murdoch.
[02:14:53.054 --> 02:14:53.394]  Exactly.
[02:14:53.434 --> 02:14:55.356]  Nobody's saying Ailes is perfect.
[02:14:55.396 --> 02:14:57.818]  The point is he was taken out for this change.
[02:14:58.118 --> 02:15:00.160]  The family then came out and admitted they're for Hillary.
[02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:02.862]  And now I watch it when I'm on the treadmill working out in the morning.
[02:15:02.882 --> 02:15:03.763]  I flip back and forth.
[02:15:04.343 --> 02:15:05.965]  It's what CNN was five years ago.
[02:15:06.765 --> 02:15:08.507]  And of course MSNBC is the most extreme.
[02:15:08.727 --> 02:15:09.568]  But CNN is horrible.
[02:15:09.628 --> 02:15:10.829]  I mean, they'll have fair and balanced.
[02:15:11.550 --> 02:15:12.611]  The host is neutral.
[02:15:13.351 --> 02:15:19.157]  Let's say with Hammer, and then they'll have the Republican lady on going, oh, Hillary just stumbled, she didn't fall.
[02:15:19.397 --> 02:15:22.800]  Conspiracy, and the Democrat goes, that's right, Hillary can climb Mount Everest.
[02:15:23.100 --> 02:15:28.886]  I mean, and then the next show, the next show, it is now tilted towards Hillary, and they have the worst polls.
[02:15:29.226 --> 02:15:31.468]  In the Fox polls, she's always leading more than anybody.
[02:15:32.329 --> 02:15:36.292]  What's interesting, Alex, is they're losing viewers every single day.
[02:15:36.913 --> 02:15:37.814]  Where are they going?
[02:15:38.635 --> 02:15:40.716]  They're going here to Infowars.com.
[02:15:40.736 --> 02:15:41.937]  They're going to Breitbart News.
[02:15:41.977 --> 02:15:44.838]  Which is why Hillary says she's going to shut us down, the alt-right.
[02:15:45.118 --> 02:15:46.099]  Let's say she gets in.
[02:15:46.519 --> 02:15:49.081]  They're saying fairness doctrine, federal legislation.
[02:15:49.101 --> 02:15:52.142]  They've actually announced they're coming after us in mainstream news.
[02:15:52.202 --> 02:15:55.904]  I mean, I can't believe a left sits there and goes, no one reads our papers, so let's just shut them down.
[02:15:56.144 --> 02:15:56.985]  Don't you idiots get it?
[02:15:57.005 --> 02:15:58.005]  They'll never go to you!
[02:15:58.065 --> 02:15:58.746]  They hate you!
[02:15:59.699 --> 02:16:02.261]  And they're boring, and no one believes them anymore.
[02:16:02.301 --> 02:16:06.964]  They have shredded their credibility by being stooges for the New World Order.
[02:16:07.404 --> 02:16:08.825]  It's over for cable television.
[02:16:08.845 --> 02:16:14.428]  Listen, I've had people in public walk up to me in Austin and say, I used to like you, but why are you a homophobe, or why are you racist?
[02:16:14.949 --> 02:16:19.872]  And I go, show me where I was sensitive and bad about somebody who's gay, or where I'm hurting black people.
[02:16:19.952 --> 02:16:20.752]  It's all made up.
[02:16:20.772 --> 02:16:23.414]  And they go, actually, I haven't heard that, but I just heard you are.
[02:16:23.934 --> 02:16:25.976]  And it's like, listen, I'm the real liberal.
[02:16:26.036 --> 02:16:27.197]  I'm against nuclear war.
[02:16:27.217 --> 02:16:28.458]  I want lower taxes.
[02:16:28.498 --> 02:16:29.439]  I want you to be able to live your life.
[02:16:29.739 --> 02:16:31.700]  I don't want colleges to say what words to use.
[02:16:31.921 --> 02:16:33.902]  We're not a giant brainwashing cult.
[02:16:34.142 --> 02:16:36.344]  You people are under the mind control.
[02:16:36.724 --> 02:16:37.245]  Wake up.
[02:16:37.285 --> 02:16:38.686]  I mean, you're for marijuana legalization.
[02:16:38.886 --> 02:16:39.547]  You're a libertarian.
[02:16:39.567 --> 02:16:40.528]  You're involved in all this stuff.
[02:16:40.808 --> 02:16:42.409]  You've been against the Bushes for over a decade.
[02:16:42.629 --> 02:16:43.830]  It's not like we're sitting here.
[02:16:44.050 --> 02:16:46.412]  The Democrats have turned into like a cult of loons.
[02:16:47.406 --> 02:16:51.910]  Well, name-calling is a staple of the left's bag of tricks.
[02:16:52.270 --> 02:16:56.994]  When they can't refute your arguments, they start to name-call you.
[02:16:57.354 --> 02:17:02.118]  Max Boot, this punk, kept calling me a conspiracy theorist for the next breath, he would say.
[02:17:03.078 --> 02:17:04.900]  Donald Trump's running down America.
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:06.601]  Everything in this country is great.
[02:17:06.901 --> 02:17:08.402]  Things are going terrifically.
[02:17:08.743 --> 02:17:11.165]  What planet does this guy live on?
[02:17:11.525 --> 02:17:13.567]  And he's salivating for war.
[02:17:13.867 --> 02:17:15.588]  They can't wait to have war.
[02:17:16.409 --> 02:17:17.570]  Praising the
[02:17:18.842 --> 02:17:20.843]  Look, they're demon possessed.
[02:17:20.883 --> 02:17:22.104]  They're demon possessed.
[02:17:22.144 --> 02:17:23.845]  I mean, something is wrong with these people.
[02:17:24.305 --> 02:17:25.546]  I mean, I mentioned this earlier.
[02:17:25.646 --> 02:17:27.487]  I've got plenty of news to get to, but I'm going to go back to this.
[02:17:28.007 --> 02:17:32.550]  I'm watching congressional hearings where Republicans and Democrats are saying, we want a no-fly zone.
[02:17:32.570 --> 02:17:34.251]  And they go, Russia was invited in.
[02:17:34.291 --> 02:17:35.151]  We had a deal with them.
[02:17:35.451 --> 02:17:36.512]  We've broken the ceasefire.
[02:17:36.552 --> 02:17:38.053]  But if we attack Russia, they'll attack back.
[02:17:38.113 --> 02:17:39.533]  And they go, but we have drones.
[02:17:39.593 --> 02:17:42.215]  And they go, but they'll attack where the drones are launched from.
[02:17:42.235 --> 02:17:42.635]  They'll attack.
[02:17:42.655 --> 02:17:43.676]  And they just go, attack!
[02:17:43.696 --> 02:17:45.777]  And they go, OK, give us a declaration of war.
[02:17:46.618 --> 02:17:53.240]  I mean, the generals are the ones restrained now from the loons that keep thinking we attack Russia, they're like Iraq or something.
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:56.581]  I mean, don't they get we're not cruise-missiling Sudan here?
[02:17:58.541 --> 02:18:10.184]  The other thing I noticed today among the political establishment is that Governor Bill Weld, who was running for Vice President on the Libertarian ticket,
[02:18:11.076 --> 02:18:15.681]  Has essentially announced that he's no longer supporting his running mate, Gary Johnson, who selected him.
[02:18:16.201 --> 02:18:20.505]  He's betrayed the delegates who selected him at the National Convention of the Libertarian Party.
[02:18:20.865 --> 02:18:25.890]  He's endorsed Hillary, and he's now out campaigning against Donald Trump.
[02:18:25.970 --> 02:18:28.052]  And that was the plan all along?
[02:18:28.072 --> 02:18:29.293]  I have no question.
[02:18:29.614 --> 02:18:34.959]  Ambassador Weld, oh pardon me, Ambassador Weld, what deal did he make?
[02:18:36.705 --> 02:18:37.765]  You know Johnson well.
[02:18:37.845 --> 02:18:39.566]  You ran with presidential campaigns.
[02:18:39.666 --> 02:18:40.566]  I liked him before.
[02:18:40.586 --> 02:18:41.566]  I know him.
[02:18:41.626 --> 02:18:43.427]  I've probably interviewed him ten times in person.
[02:18:43.447 --> 02:18:45.807]  The last time he was here, he was like a different person.
[02:18:46.727 --> 02:18:48.308]  I said he acted mentally ill or crazy.
[02:18:48.328 --> 02:18:49.148]  Has he had a stroke?
[02:18:49.508 --> 02:18:53.349]  Or what's going on with his tongue sticking out and not knowing any world leader?
[02:18:54.129 --> 02:18:54.649]  What's going on?
[02:18:55.630 --> 02:18:57.470]  I don't think the campaign has any guidance.
[02:18:57.930 --> 02:19:05.172]  More importantly, I can't understand how his campaign has raised, I think in the next report it would be about $10 million.
[02:19:06.374 --> 02:19:09.595]  Have you seen a lot of his TV commercials there in Texas, Alex?
[02:19:09.635 --> 02:19:09.675]  No.
[02:19:09.735 --> 02:19:11.136]  Of course, radio commercials.
[02:19:11.796 --> 02:19:12.936]  Where's this money going?
[02:19:13.577 --> 02:19:16.138]  His filings with the FEC are opaque.
[02:19:16.158 --> 02:19:19.839]  And by the way, he announced last week, he said, I'm going to dedicate my time to bringing on Trump now.
[02:19:19.899 --> 02:19:21.500]  So they're showing they're desperate.
[02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:26.801]  The Libertarian Party's been taken over as a kamikaze zero going into the Trump Lexington.
[02:19:27.021 --> 02:19:28.022]  And I'm not going to put up with it.
[02:19:28.766 --> 02:19:31.788]  It's very, very sad because I think Gary Johnson's a good man.
[02:19:32.188 --> 02:19:37.591]  He's been betrayed by his quizzling Harvard-educated establishment running mate.
[02:19:37.611 --> 02:19:39.952]  Now, I like Bill Weld on a personal level.
[02:19:40.293 --> 02:19:45.175]  He's a highly intelligent, engaging guy, and he was a great governor of Massachusetts.
[02:19:45.215 --> 02:19:47.477]  He governed as a real libertarian.
[02:19:47.557 --> 02:19:50.718]  Low taxes, low spending, support for the Second Amendment.
[02:19:51.399 --> 02:19:55.161]  That's not the Bill Weld who's running in this campaign for Vice President.
[02:19:55.481 --> 02:19:56.782]  He's just made his deal.
[02:19:57.910 --> 02:20:02.393]  In a complete example of treachery with Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[02:20:02.653 --> 02:20:03.194]  Unbelievable.
[02:20:03.234 --> 02:20:05.635]  Well, Roger, I know you're a busy man.
[02:20:05.995 --> 02:20:06.556]  I know you're a busy man.
[02:20:06.576 --> 02:20:13.761]  I want you to take two minutes up to finish up any other points and then I want to invite you back after the debate is over for like 10 minutes to give your analysis of what happened.
[02:20:14.141 --> 02:20:17.663]  The debate is coming up in an hour and 40 minutes exactly after 90 minutes after that.
[02:20:18.103 --> 02:20:19.304]  I know you have a lot of interviews coming up.
[02:20:19.564 --> 02:20:23.927]  Can you, when I put you on hold in a moment, tell the crew sometime after
[02:20:25.228 --> 02:20:28.789]  I guess that'd be 10.30 Eastern, 9.30 Central that you can pop in.
[02:20:28.809 --> 02:20:29.389]  Is that possible?
[02:20:30.870 --> 02:20:32.430]  Let's try to work it out.
[02:20:32.490 --> 02:20:35.331]  And if you can't do it, then tomorrow, because obviously we've got the daytime show.
[02:20:35.351 --> 02:20:35.591]  Go ahead.
[02:20:35.611 --> 02:20:37.612]  This is very important.
[02:20:37.692 --> 02:20:41.233]  Again, tonight, only minutes from now...
[02:20:42.153 --> 02:20:55.566]  Hillary Clinton will begin the debate by refusing to shake Trump's hand, and then by prearrangement, Anderson Cooper will ask her why, setting her up for a blistering attack on Trump.
[02:20:55.686 --> 02:20:58.349]  Now, Donald Trump is warned.
[02:20:58.629 --> 02:20:59.990]  His campaign is warned.
[02:21:00.631 --> 02:21:02.813]  The media has now been tipped off.
[02:21:03.273 --> 02:21:04.435]  Let's see what Hillary does.
[02:21:06.038 --> 02:21:13.463]  You know, we discussed whether you'd come on 10 minutes before the debate and do this and not tell them, and then see if they went ahead with it and not give them a chance to pull back.
[02:21:13.483 --> 02:21:17.306]  If we wanted personal mojo, we would just do that to say, see, we were right, she did it.
[02:21:17.826 --> 02:21:19.347]  But we're a shot across the bow.
[02:21:19.907 --> 02:21:23.610]  You know, I mean, you were on 45 minutes ago, so two hours plus before the debate.
[02:21:23.630 --> 02:21:25.691]  We're now an hour and 38 minutes out.
[02:21:26.352 --> 02:21:27.473]  We have given them fair warning.
[02:21:27.493 --> 02:21:30.595]  Do you think it's time to percolate up to their campaign?
[02:21:31.587 --> 02:21:33.229]  Well look, we're like Paul Revere.
[02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:37.295]  This is an early warning and therefore it needs to be all over Twitter and Facebook.
[02:21:37.756 --> 02:21:40.059]  We have uncovered the plot!
[02:21:40.874 --> 02:21:43.136]  Anderson Cooper's in it with the Clinton campaign.
[02:21:43.496 --> 02:21:47.900]  CNN stands for Clinton News Network.
[02:21:48.300 --> 02:21:51.362]  So this debate is a fraud.
[02:21:51.382 --> 02:21:52.984]  So give me the tweet, because I'm going to go to break.
[02:21:53.064 --> 02:21:53.864]  I'm going to tweet.
[02:21:54.185 --> 02:22:01.470]  Roger, I mean, do I just say Clinton and Cooper to launch attack on Trump out of Gates?
[02:22:01.510 --> 02:22:02.071]  Or what do we say?
[02:22:02.331 --> 02:22:02.831]  Or Clinton?
[02:22:02.851 --> 02:22:07.175]  What I would say is Hillary Clinton will refuse to shake Donald Trump's hand
[02:22:08.035 --> 02:22:13.239]  And Anderson Cooper will ask her why in a setup to take down Donald Trump.
[02:22:21.857 --> 02:22:22.497]  Works for me.
[02:22:22.517 --> 02:22:23.858]  I think we can work that out.
[02:22:23.958 --> 02:22:31.041]  I'm just, as you can imagine, it's a hectic day because I have concerned Trump supporters from all over the country calling me saying
[02:22:41.101 --> 02:22:43.202]  Please tell Mr. Trump not to drop out!
[02:23:05.507 --> 02:23:11.589]  The same media said that Trump was for the Iraq War when we have six clips saying he wasn't before the damn thing.
[02:23:11.849 --> 02:23:12.969]  They are liars!
[02:23:13.349 --> 02:23:17.471]  We have Gruber saying, I met with Obama on how to deceive the public to triple their prices.
[02:23:17.711 --> 02:23:19.331]  I mean, hasn't the public gotten it?
[02:23:19.511 --> 02:23:21.972]  They have to stop believing these frickin' people!
[02:23:23.323 --> 02:23:28.669]  I think the public has gotten it, but if you are a Trump supporter, you can see how you might be downhearted.
[02:23:28.689 --> 02:23:29.169]  Stampeded.
[02:23:29.229 --> 02:23:30.150]  Stampeded like lemons.
[02:23:30.210 --> 02:23:33.814]  Because you read constantly that Trump is considering dropping out.
[02:23:34.135 --> 02:23:36.137]  Alex, let me say this and be absolutely clear.
[02:23:36.557 --> 02:23:39.200]  He never even thought about dropping out.
[02:23:39.420 --> 02:23:40.521]  He's a fighter.
[02:23:40.882 --> 02:23:41.983]  He's a brawler.
[02:23:42.543 --> 02:23:45.747]  Anybody who writes him on... He intends to fight if they try to steal it!
[02:23:46.915 --> 02:23:48.415]  He's already signaled that.
[02:23:48.435 --> 02:23:49.196]  We will never stop.
[02:23:49.236 --> 02:23:50.656]  We will never go away.
[02:23:50.696 --> 02:23:51.696]  We will never give in.
[02:23:51.997 --> 02:23:52.757]  We will go on.
[02:23:53.017 --> 02:23:55.658]  No matter what it takes, we will defend this republic!
[02:23:57.438 --> 02:23:57.778]  Amen.
[02:23:57.898 --> 02:23:59.379]  I'm paraphrasing Winston Churchill.
[02:23:59.739 --> 02:24:02.199]  Alright, StoneColdTruth.com.
[02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:04.920]  Get the Clinton Rape Shirt at InfoWars.com.
[02:24:05.560 --> 02:24:07.521]  We are the exclusive group outside of Stone.
[02:24:07.561 --> 02:24:08.621]  He's the only other person selling it.
[02:24:08.641 --> 02:24:09.842]  I don't care where you get it.
[02:24:09.882 --> 02:24:10.822]  Just get out in public.
[02:24:10.862 --> 02:24:11.202]  Wear it.
[02:24:11.242 --> 02:24:12.302]  Get in these people's faces.
[02:24:12.723 --> 02:24:13.683]  Break their conditioning.
[02:24:14.523 --> 02:24:19.785]  And point out that it is Clinton flying around with Epstein, the convicted pedophile, not Donald Trump.
[02:24:19.805 --> 02:24:21.626]  This is made up with John Doe filings.
[02:24:21.926 --> 02:24:22.767]  Completely fake.
[02:24:23.367 --> 02:24:25.488]  Too close to the election to ever prove it one way or the other.
[02:24:25.788 --> 02:24:26.628]  This is incredible.
[02:24:26.768 --> 02:24:28.369]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:24:28.609 --> 02:24:29.590]  The Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[02:24:29.930 --> 02:24:30.570]  Limited edition.
[02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:32.011]  We also have the Hillary for prison shirt.
[02:24:32.351 --> 02:24:32.691]  Wear it.
[02:24:32.771 --> 02:24:33.892]  Do your own YouTubes with it.
[02:24:34.212 --> 02:24:35.192]  I don't care what you do.
[02:24:35.472 --> 02:24:39.554]  Just get, even if you're not going to do it on national TV for the prize, just get the word out.
[02:24:39.594 --> 02:24:41.375]  In fact, I think it's going to cascade this week.
[02:24:41.395 --> 02:24:42.836]  I think it's going to get even bigger this week.
[02:24:42.856 --> 02:24:43.496]  What do you think, Roger?
[02:24:44.144 --> 02:24:45.365]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:24:45.425 --> 02:24:58.093]  And now that I have read that Bill Clinton is going to undertake a bus tour on behalf of his wife, it's time to introduce the official Bill Clinton rape whistle.
[02:24:58.494 --> 02:25:03.897]  Because everywhere he goes, our people need to whistle in huge numbers.
[02:25:04.057 --> 02:25:06.599]  Can you imagine five or six women in one group whistling?
[02:25:06.659 --> 02:25:08.200]  It'll take them an hour to get them all out.
[02:25:08.260 --> 02:25:09.501]  Rape, rape, whistle, whistle!
[02:25:10.663 --> 02:25:11.223]  Exactly.
[02:25:11.403 --> 02:25:19.507]  So stay tuned, very shortly you'll be able to go online and get your official Bill Clinton rape whistle.
[02:25:19.607 --> 02:25:21.568]  Are you going to let us be distributors as well?
[02:25:22.327 --> 02:25:23.648]  We've already made a deal with your people.
[02:25:24.008 --> 02:25:24.248]  Good.
[02:25:24.308 --> 02:25:25.549]  I know you're just great with Weldon.
[02:25:25.569 --> 02:25:25.730]  Great.
[02:25:25.970 --> 02:25:28.932]  Let me just say this final thing, Mr. Revere, Mr. Roger Stone.
[02:25:29.612 --> 02:25:40.780]  Do you think she's disappearing in an announcement for another 20 days, and is only saying she's going to do this event, and now her surrogates, Kane and Bill, are out there stumbling around, I mean, confronted by people saying that, you know, obviously they're involved in stuff?
[02:25:41.301 --> 02:25:45.704]  Do you think that's because she is so sick, or is it because they don't want her confronted with Bill Clinton rape?
[02:25:46.841 --> 02:25:49.984]  I don't think she has the stamina for a campaign.
[02:25:50.164 --> 02:25:53.107]  Look, of course she was jacked up on something.
[02:25:53.127 --> 02:25:59.252]  I assume some kind of methamphetamine, as John Kennedy was, by the way.
[02:26:00.673 --> 02:26:01.594]  He was being injected with it.
[02:26:02.253 --> 02:26:04.315]  Yes, by Dr. Max Jacobson.
[02:26:04.695 --> 02:26:07.898]  So, they managed to prop her up for one debate.
[02:26:08.498 --> 02:26:13.383]  She can't even keep a full schedule because her health is so bad.
[02:26:13.503 --> 02:26:22.951]  Now, for those who say, ah, that's a conspiracy theory, why do we have email in which she's asking for Parkinson's medicine?
[02:26:23.031 --> 02:26:23.551]  We have her.
[02:26:24.733 --> 02:26:34.476]  Finally, another question, and then I'm going to this tape, and I'm going to go to the studio, do 30 minutes, have another guest on, and then hand the baton for an hour to the other crew, and then I'm going to come in and cover the debate live, and then they will take over in the aftermath.
[02:26:34.496 --> 02:26:39.698]  I'll do 30 minutes with you, but they'll do an hour and a half after that, and take phone calls as well here on the Sunday night.
[02:26:39.718 --> 02:26:40.518]  Then I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:26:40.538 --> 02:26:40.838]  to 3 p.m.
[02:26:43.779 --> 02:26:44.759]  I confirmed with my sources.
[02:26:44.819 --> 02:26:46.940]  I talked to you, so that's incredible you have the same sources.
[02:26:47.460 --> 02:26:50.321]  Well, similar information that a New York lawyer threatened him.
[02:26:50.581 --> 02:26:51.541]  He admitted he'd been threatened.
[02:26:51.561 --> 02:26:56.103]  He canceled the Wednesday event, then did Skype, then backed off, said, well, we'll release it in two days.
[02:26:56.443 --> 02:26:57.623]  They did release it Friday.
[02:26:58.103 --> 02:26:59.664]  Milk toast compared to what he said it was.
[02:26:59.704 --> 02:27:01.204]  He said it would, you know, it would get her indicted.
[02:27:01.264 --> 02:27:05.225]  It's just more corporate stuff, more globalism, more world government, no, no borders.
[02:27:05.245 --> 02:27:05.826]  We already knew that.
[02:27:06.826 --> 02:27:07.826]  So we have her doing that.
[02:27:08.106 --> 02:27:10.747]  It looks to me like, at least so far, WikiLeaks has chickened out.
[02:27:12.103 --> 02:27:14.128]  I'm not prepared to make that judgment yet.
[02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:18.519]  He did promise revelations for 10 weeks at the beginning of each week.
[02:27:19.041 --> 02:27:21.306]  Let's see what happens on Monday.
[02:27:22.548 --> 02:27:37.511]  The release of her bank speech is not insignificant, because what it shows the American people is, she says one thing in public, then she says something entirely different to her well-heeled patrons who are financing her aspirations for power.
[02:27:37.531 --> 02:27:38.812]  Sure, and she bad mouths her constituents.
[02:27:39.592 --> 02:27:43.253]  Proving, once again, that she's a pathological liar.
[02:27:44.173 --> 02:27:46.073]  Alright, Roger Stone, thank you so much.
[02:27:46.093 --> 02:27:48.774]  We'll talk to you again this evening, and tomorrow, 11am to 3pm sometime.
[02:27:48.794 --> 02:27:49.014]  Thank you.
[02:27:49.721 --> 02:27:50.622]  Great to be here, Alex.
[02:27:50.682 --> 02:27:51.202]  Many thanks.
[02:27:51.262 --> 02:27:51.583]  Thank you.
[02:27:52.083 --> 02:27:55.166]  I'm going to go to this piece I shot yesterday, basically promoing tonight.
[02:27:55.186 --> 02:27:57.368]  I did it from the edge of a cliff for a reason.
[02:27:57.768 --> 02:28:15.524]  Then in seven minutes when it's over, I'm going to be at the other studio, and I've got some clips I want to play dealing with the Clintons and dealing with the whole TPP and her wanting to raise taxes on the middle class, and how it ties into Tim Kaine wanting to admit her emails have been hacked, even though they're admitted to be real.
[02:28:16.244 --> 02:28:17.165]  And we've got a lot more.
[02:28:17.605 --> 02:28:21.927]  So, there's a lot of other news, obviously, breaking up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:28:22.607 --> 02:28:24.889]  We're an hour and 32 minutes out from the debate.
[02:28:25.469 --> 02:28:36.775]  And it's important that your neighbors, your friends, your families, on your smart TV or whatever, you can put it on your big screen TV, have the neighbors over, or you can, you know, send your neighbor Infowars.com forward slash app, say, hey, download it on your Droid or iPhone.
[02:28:37.395 --> 02:28:38.676]  That's how we get more people tuning in.
[02:28:38.696 --> 02:28:41.477]  Let me tell you, we're up to, like, 3 million people tuned into some of these now.
[02:28:41.917 --> 02:28:43.958]  Or we can look, verify, 3 million tune in.
[02:28:44.559 --> 02:28:44.979]  You know, a couple...
[02:28:46.018 --> 02:28:48.959]  You know, like a million and a half live, the next day a million, two million more.
[02:28:48.979 --> 02:28:51.600]  That's not just counting millions on AM and FM and TV.
[02:28:51.941 --> 02:28:52.701]  That's exciting.
[02:28:52.741 --> 02:28:54.542]  That's bigger than most networks have carrying this.
[02:28:54.562 --> 02:28:56.222]  And it's because you're spreading the word.
[02:28:56.282 --> 02:28:57.183]  You're the real power.
[02:28:57.703 --> 02:29:00.024]  You're the oxygen in the room for this whole thing.
[02:29:00.064 --> 02:29:01.785]  So, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:29:02.805 --> 02:29:04.989]  Or simply, InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:29:05.590 --> 02:29:07.793]  You can download the free podcast, link to that.
[02:29:07.813 --> 02:29:10.758]  There's a free video feed and so much more.
[02:29:10.898 --> 02:29:13.802]  Live Trump versus the globalist world debate.
[02:29:13.883 --> 02:29:16.427]  Share this link, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:29:16.487 --> 02:29:17.228]  Great job to the crew.
[02:29:18.189 --> 02:29:33.357]  I'm gonna take a little seven-minute break to get my articles together, walk across into the TV studio, and we're gonna get ready to kick off our official, let me see, one and a half hours, another half, three hours, four hours, but another five hours or so of live coverage from the InfoWars News Center in Austin, Texas.
[02:29:33.797 --> 02:29:34.597]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:34.657 --> 02:29:35.858]  Stay with us and spread the word.
[02:29:37.108 --> 02:29:40.591]  We're now only 30 days out from the November 8, 2016 election.
[02:29:40.691 --> 02:29:45.395]  I'm Alex Jones for InfoWars.com and I've got a message for Donald Trump.
[02:29:46.055 --> 02:29:47.837]  Attack Hillary or drop out.
[02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:59.846]  We're coming to you this Saturday evening from right outside Austin, Texas on the edge of a literal 400-foot-plus cliff.
[02:30:00.707 --> 02:30:04.550]  And at the end of this incredibly important emergency alert,
[02:30:05.523 --> 02:30:10.905]  I'm going to break down why I chose this location to cover this information.
[02:30:11.646 --> 02:30:30.474]  If Donald Trump doesn't double down out of the gates tomorrow night during the debate against Hillary on Sunday, that we'll be covering live, and just viciously go into the fact that how dare your surrogate media dredge up edited 11-year tapes of locker room, you know, guy talk, while you have protected Bill and gone after the women
[02:30:31.721 --> 02:30:36.643]  With your female cover, over and over again, while Bill settled sexual assault and rape cases.
[02:30:36.923 --> 02:30:50.970]  How dare you sit there and bring up that I made some comments about some Miss Universe eating too much, and so I hate women, but then meanwhile, you are openly funding the jihadists in the Middle East, the Wahhabists, the ISIS people.
[02:30:51.250 --> 02:30:54.872]  That's the proxy armies that Hillary and Obama have been literally running.
[02:30:55.572 --> 02:31:00.978]  To go in and then butcher Christians in mass and enslave women and sell children into sex slavery.
[02:31:01.218 --> 02:31:04.001]  I mean, understand, Hillary is literally quarterbacking all this.
[02:31:04.281 --> 02:31:05.162]  So is John McCain.
[02:31:05.502 --> 02:31:06.603]  It's bipartisan treason.
[02:31:07.024 --> 02:31:07.964]  And we've been exposing it.
[02:31:08.385 --> 02:31:13.009]  This is the type of hypocrisy that you've got to come out of the gates and attack, not sit there and defend yourself.
[02:31:13.650 --> 02:31:17.054]  But for the sake of rational thought, let's take Donald Trump out of the equation.
[02:31:17.987 --> 02:31:22.330]  And let's look at who Hillary Clinton is and how she's protected her husband.
[02:31:22.690 --> 02:31:26.712]  She went after the women viciously that would expose his rapes, his sexual abuse.
[02:31:26.952 --> 02:31:28.213]  He settled some of these cases.
[02:31:28.513 --> 02:31:29.234]  This is well known.
[02:31:30.875 --> 02:31:36.118]  And so how could the mainstream media ignore all of that and have a major embargo against that information being brought up?
[02:31:36.988 --> 02:31:49.311]  I mean, you get banned off CNN, Fox, you name it if you bring it up, and then sit around and take Donald Trump 11 years ago and some edited locker room tape and turn this into the biggest issue in the world and how he hates women.
[02:31:49.851 --> 02:31:50.871]  This is such a ploy.
[02:31:52.011 --> 02:31:58.333]  And that's the reason I'm on a cliff here today, because there are many species that can be stampeded through hype, through fear, off the edge of a cliff.
[02:31:59.364 --> 02:32:04.745]  And to Lemmings, going over the edge of a cliff, they feel like they're doing the right thing because everybody else is going in that direction.
[02:32:05.226 --> 02:32:21.290]  And that's what these big globalist hype machines do, like Obamacare, that promise to give you free healthcare or keep your doctor, and then you have Gruber, the guy that orchestrated it, admitting that Obama hired him to help lie to the public, and thank God the public doesn't pay attention and doesn't have attention spans.
[02:32:21.830 --> 02:32:24.292]  Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.
[02:32:24.913 --> 02:32:28.055]  And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever.
[02:32:28.576 --> 02:32:32.639]  But basically, that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.
[02:32:32.879 --> 02:32:34.140]  That's what all of this is about.
[02:32:34.400 --> 02:32:36.822]  The establishment that's been screwing you over forever.
[02:32:37.583 --> 02:32:53.495]  He wants you to be mad at Donald Trump about some racy comments 11 years ago, but then completely ignore Hillary in Benghazi and four Americans dying, ordering the stand down, being caught lying about it, and then saying, what difference does it make?
[02:32:54.136 --> 02:32:56.578]  The fact is we had four dead Americans.
[02:32:56.598 --> 02:33:01.802]  Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans?
[02:33:02.395 --> 02:33:04.917]  What difference at this point does it make?
[02:33:05.558 --> 02:33:13.124]  Our society, our culture, militarily, spiritually, economically, is all being basically demolished right now.
[02:33:13.685 --> 02:33:17.748]  Open corporate world government via the TPP and other systems is being established.
[02:33:18.409 --> 02:33:22.152]  And in the UK, they have begun to pull out of this with the Brexit and Nigel Farage.
[02:33:22.612 --> 02:33:26.856]  Here in the US, we're beginning through populism to pull out, and Donald Trump's just one manifestation of that.
[02:33:27.476 --> 02:33:30.659]  Russia is doing the same thing as well, pulling out of this corporate world government.
[02:33:31.860 --> 02:33:41.545]  And the controlled media and the basic domesticated masses have been programmed that all of this is a foregone conclusion and that we have to go along with this system.
[02:33:42.125 --> 02:33:44.586]  But we don't have to be herded like lemmings over the edge of a cliff.
[02:33:44.866 --> 02:33:48.668]  We don't have to be mindless animals that are just easily programmed.
[02:33:49.349 --> 02:33:51.610]  If people claim they want change and they're sick of the establishment,
[02:33:52.401 --> 02:34:00.188]  And then you sit back and you see the entire corporate media combine doing everything they can to stop Donald Trump and the populist movement.
[02:34:00.248 --> 02:34:01.009]  What does that tell you?
[02:34:01.610 --> 02:34:03.291]  That you really don't want change.
[02:34:03.651 --> 02:34:06.554]  That you really do want the crumbs off the table from the establishment.
[02:34:06.794 --> 02:34:09.417]  You really do like NAFTA and GATT and the TPP.
[02:34:09.937 --> 02:34:14.862]  You really do like associating yourself with the mainstream media, which admittedly is collapsing.
[02:34:16.291 --> 02:34:17.512]  It's time to stop being followers.
[02:34:17.752 --> 02:34:18.814]  It's time to start being leaders.
[02:34:19.334 --> 02:34:24.619]  And of course you can also look at what's happened with past Democrat and Republican presidents.
[02:34:24.679 --> 02:34:29.404]  I mean, did anybody go after JFK, who was probably ten times the womanizer of Trump?
[02:34:29.865 --> 02:34:30.025]  No.
[02:34:30.465 --> 02:34:32.767]  Did people go after Clinton for all his womanizing and rape?
[02:34:32.848 --> 02:34:33.768]  No, that's what I'm saying.
[02:34:34.409 --> 02:34:40.072]  Is this is just all a bunch of hype where everyone decides to get offended and now we're not going to support him.
[02:34:40.593 --> 02:34:48.737]  Show that when he still has his landslide victory, they come in with electronic voting machines, steal it, but there's the perception that he's discredited and lost and was a loser.
[02:34:49.277 --> 02:34:52.819]  The attempt to take down Trump is as big a fraud as Obamacare.
[02:34:52.839 --> 02:34:59.443]  If you'll just read the fine print and actually look at the legislation, you would have known it was a scam written by insurance companies to rip you off.
[02:34:59.683 --> 02:35:00.504]  And it's the same thing here.
[02:35:01.184 --> 02:35:02.005]  The facts are there.
[02:35:02.685 --> 02:35:08.291]  The globalists that are our enemies and have taken this country over are absolutely opposed to Donald Trump for good reason.
[02:35:08.491 --> 02:35:09.292]  He's a nationalist.
[02:35:09.632 --> 02:35:10.673]  He will put America first.
[02:35:10.993 --> 02:35:12.755]  That's why the political system is panicking.
[02:35:12.955 --> 02:35:14.536]  They want a nation of total followers.
[02:35:15.453 --> 02:35:30.586]  Before I conclude, I also want to relay to the viewers and listeners of this broadcast that we have been given an exclusive dossier from moles inside the Democratic Party of the future attack plan on Donald J. Trump that will be launched on Monday and Tuesday.
[02:35:31.087 --> 02:35:35.650]  This exclusive information in detail will be relayed tomorrow.
[02:35:36.291 --> 02:35:44.081]  But to give you a hint of one of their new major attacks, remember eight months ago the dismissed, fake 14-year-old rape victim in Houston?
[02:35:44.501 --> 02:35:45.603]  Fake name, you name it.
[02:35:46.003 --> 02:35:47.485]  And then others were filed in New York?
[02:35:48.502 --> 02:35:55.187]  That was done so news reports could be compiled for later off of those frivolous reports.
[02:35:55.888 --> 02:35:59.550]  And so if you think the setup of Donald Trump is bad now, get ready.
[02:35:59.791 --> 02:36:07.737]  That's why they're laying the groundwork with this audio of him talking about how much he likes women before they release the next fake salvo.
[02:36:08.337 --> 02:36:10.539]  Join myself, Alex Jones, and the InfoWars crew.
[02:36:11.059 --> 02:36:15.562]  Sunday night, in less than 24 hours, we will cover the second historic debate.
[02:36:16.102 --> 02:36:20.125]  Trump must go on the attack and blast through the disinformation and lies.
[02:36:20.726 --> 02:36:37.497]  All of you need to understand this is an InfoWar, and it's critical for you to get your friends, your family, your neighbors, and others to tune in tomorrow night to the free streams at InfoWars.com forward slash show, or via the free app that has audio and video feeds as well as news, InfoWars.com forward slash app,
[02:36:37.638 --> 02:36:38.361]  We're good to go.
[02:36:47.227 --> 02:36:48.527]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:36:49.007 --> 02:36:50.508]  Because there is a war on.
[02:36:51.028 --> 02:36:51.708]  Or your mind.
[02:36:52.228 --> 02:36:55.949]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle.
[02:36:55.969 --> 02:36:57.129]  There's a guy named Alex Jones.
[02:36:57.189 --> 02:36:58.069]  Alex Jones.
[02:36:58.089 --> 02:36:59.089]  From Info Wars.
[02:36:59.149 --> 02:36:59.769]  From Info Wars.
[02:36:59.809 --> 02:36:59.989]  Yeah.
[02:37:00.130 --> 02:37:00.810]  Alex Jones.
[02:37:00.890 --> 02:37:01.690]  Alex Jones.
[02:37:01.710 --> 02:37:05.150]  One of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[02:37:05.211 --> 02:37:07.991]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[02:37:08.071 --> 02:37:12.812]  Claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[02:37:13.012 --> 02:37:17.636]  The conspiracy du jour, Hillary Clinton is harboring a secret medical condition.
[02:37:17.796 --> 02:37:19.818]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you, Alex?
[02:37:20.498 --> 02:37:22.560]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know!
[02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:23.201]  Mine too!
[02:37:23.241 --> 02:37:32.508]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton's body count story.
[02:37:32.528 --> 02:37:34.210]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[02:37:34.270 --> 02:37:36.532]  And this really, this is so disgusting.
[02:37:36.552 --> 02:37:39.074]  The juice of these pickles is on you, Alex Jones.
[02:37:42.722 --> 02:37:45.423]  It goes right from Alex Jones, and it shows up in Donald Trump's mouth.
[02:37:45.483 --> 02:37:48.004]  Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama.
[02:37:48.585 --> 02:37:54.707]  The very fringe of the conspiracy movement, like Alex Jones, are being kind of incorporated into the campaign.
[02:37:54.767 --> 02:37:56.968]  If Trump gets elected, he's going to be Secretary of Defense.
[02:37:56.988 --> 02:37:58.869]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[02:37:58.909 --> 02:38:00.009]  Move, bitch!
[02:38:00.330 --> 02:38:01.170]  Get out of the way!
[02:38:01.270 --> 02:38:03.271]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, Infowars.com.
[02:38:03.291 --> 02:38:05.012]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[02:38:06.592 --> 02:38:07.733]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[02:38:07.894 --> 02:38:08.894]  Infowars.com.
[02:38:08.954 --> 02:38:09.755]  Infowars.com.
[02:38:09.775 --> 02:38:10.896]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[02:38:11.056 --> 02:38:13.178]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[02:38:16.721 --> 02:38:20.664]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:38:21.285 --> 02:38:22.906]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:38:24.187 --> 02:38:27.089]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're about to see live coverage.
[02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:28.290]  I'm not trying to interrupt too much.
[02:38:29.192 --> 02:38:33.434]  But we're going to have live coverage and analysis of the 2016 Second Historic Debate.
[02:38:33.454 --> 02:38:36.835]  I think bigger than the last one because of how staged the last one was.
[02:38:36.915 --> 02:38:42.157]  Donald Trump has got to come out with guns blazing and just point out the hypocrisy.
[02:38:42.658 --> 02:38:46.079]  Some locker room talk from 11 years ago that's clearly edited.
[02:38:47.359 --> 02:38:48.220]  Intelligently edited.
[02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:51.441]  And they're making this like the biggest thing in the world.
[02:38:51.521 --> 02:38:55.763]  The Clintons start all these wars and settle rape cases and Hillary covers it up.
[02:38:56.543 --> 02:38:57.724]  Now I knew about this a week ago.
[02:38:58.780 --> 02:39:00.480]  We're working on getting her in studio this week.
[02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:01.881]  I knew about this a week ago.
[02:39:02.761 --> 02:39:05.841]  I didn't go with it because it wasn't supposed to break until tonight.
[02:39:06.341 --> 02:39:07.401]  But it's all over Twitter.
[02:39:07.441 --> 02:39:09.982]  I had crew running up to me about it, who's not involved in producing.
[02:39:10.002 --> 02:39:16.163]  And they said, Kathy Shelton, the 12-year-old girl that got raped, was in a coma.
[02:39:16.343 --> 02:39:19.464]  Hillary was the defense lawyer for this establishment guy.
[02:39:19.864 --> 02:39:20.844]  Knew he was guilty.
[02:39:21.904 --> 02:39:24.984]  We've played the tapes of her bragging, oh man, I knew he was guilty.
[02:39:25.345 --> 02:39:28.065]  But I, you know, accused the little girl of wanting it.
[02:39:29.667 --> 02:39:31.088]  You know, wanting to have bones broken.
[02:39:32.248 --> 02:39:33.849]  And I, you know, he took a lie detector.
[02:39:33.909 --> 02:39:35.590]  I knew he was, he passed it.
[02:39:35.610 --> 02:39:36.130]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:39:36.170 --> 02:39:38.591]  I never believed in lie detectors again because I knew he was guilty.
[02:39:40.212 --> 02:39:42.353]  They've, they've opened fire with her new Twitter account.
[02:39:42.373 --> 02:39:43.013]  She just started.
[02:39:43.754 --> 02:39:44.354]  They've opened it up.
[02:39:44.374 --> 02:39:55.079]  I guess they think it's too late an hour before, an hour and 20 minutes before, but she's going to be in the front row when Hillary comes out and goes, how dare you talk about grabbing a woman's, you know, wee-wee or whatever.
[02:39:56.590 --> 02:39:57.691]  I mean, boom!
[02:39:57.771 --> 02:39:59.192]  They're gonna hit her with that.
[02:39:59.793 --> 02:39:59.893]  Oh!
[02:40:00.473 --> 02:40:02.094]  Like Kathy Sheldon you represented?
[02:40:02.615 --> 02:40:05.477]  With a convicted pedophile that you knew was innocent like that?
[02:40:08.099 --> 02:40:10.461]  So, that's some of the surprises coming up tonight.
[02:40:12.222 --> 02:40:13.903]  Now these things can change as they go.
[02:40:15.304 --> 02:40:19.808]  But guess what, guess what Kit Daniels is writing an article about?
[02:40:21.198 --> 02:40:45.334]  I told crew members on Friday that we were going to get a dossier on Saturday, and I said they were going to come out in court and accept the case of three Jane Does, the victim, the madam, and some person that just heard about it later, that Donald Trump, with Jerry Epstein, who's the Clinton Foundation founder and best buddies, whether they fly around the world to non-pedophile sultans' houses, you name it, I covered it earlier,
[02:40:46.957 --> 02:41:05.872]  That because they knew that Trump had that as his doomsday device, why not just file these lawsuits with no names on it, have a book that was starting to be written a year ago that is going to be published tomorrow, out of the blue, and get all this attention that it wasn't Epstein, it was Trump.
[02:41:07.934 --> 02:41:10.656]  That's right, Trump and Epstein double teaming little girls.
[02:41:10.676 --> 02:41:12.658]  22 years ago.
[02:41:15.782 --> 02:41:18.023]  So Kit Daniels says, hey Alex, did you notice?
[02:41:18.043 --> 02:41:18.804]  Here's the one independent.
[02:41:19.024 --> 02:41:22.706]  Judge sets date for hearing of lawsuit accusing Donald Trump of underage rape.
[02:41:23.747 --> 02:41:25.007]  This just came out today.
[02:41:25.087 --> 02:41:28.529]  See, I sent out a video yesterday saying they're going to accuse him of underage rape.
[02:41:29.530 --> 02:41:30.190]  I told you.
[02:41:30.610 --> 02:41:32.492]  Hell, we had stood on a year ago naming it all.
[02:41:32.532 --> 02:41:32.992]  He already knew.
[02:41:33.032 --> 02:41:34.433]  He'd been advising Trump to attack first.
[02:41:35.473 --> 02:41:36.154]  Trump didn't do it.
[02:41:37.090 --> 02:41:41.792]  Because his daughters were talking to Chelsea, and Chelsea was saying, Mom, he's going to be nice at the first debate.
[02:41:41.832 --> 02:41:42.412]  Just be nice.
[02:41:42.452 --> 02:41:43.133]  Call her secretary.
[02:41:43.433 --> 02:41:45.354]  And that means that you're going to be nice and we're going to be nice.
[02:41:45.374 --> 02:41:46.154]  And Hillary goes with a fake look.
[02:41:46.214 --> 02:41:46.834]  Oh, you're going to be nice.
[02:41:46.854 --> 02:41:47.815]  And then at the end, she attacks him.
[02:41:47.835 --> 02:41:52.017]  And he goes, you know, I was going to be nice and not bring up some bad things, and I'm still not going to.
[02:41:52.457 --> 02:41:56.179]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:41:57.699 --> 02:41:59.040]  You will attack!
[02:42:04.042 --> 02:42:07.264]  Or, I would say that they're going to definitely steal the election.
[02:42:07.304 --> 02:42:09.825]  Look, there's 10% or more that aren't telling people they're for Trump.
[02:42:10.365 --> 02:42:11.366]  That's known in the polling.
[02:42:12.186 --> 02:42:13.467]  He's way ahead in battleground states.
[02:42:13.507 --> 02:42:14.748]  He's going to have a landslide at this point.
[02:42:15.168 --> 02:42:16.088]  Even Gallup came out.
[02:42:16.108 --> 02:42:17.329]  We have a story on Infowars.com.
[02:42:17.349 --> 02:42:19.931]  He lost half a point with the pussy gate thing.
[02:42:19.971 --> 02:42:21.651]  I mean, that's not a cuss word, so I can use it.
[02:42:23.112 --> 02:42:24.333]  And so all that's going on.
[02:42:26.428 --> 02:42:28.390]  And this is to prime the pump for PedophileGate.
[02:42:28.410 --> 02:42:31.473]  They're about to launch to cover up their entire operation.
[02:42:31.973 --> 02:42:33.835]  So this is a big, big deal.
[02:42:34.495 --> 02:42:37.438]  And then Kit goes, Alex, I went and Googled that judge's name.
[02:42:38.639 --> 02:42:39.520]  And guess what we found?
[02:42:39.540 --> 02:42:41.662]  We're going to put an article out on Infowars.com the next hour.
[02:42:41.982 --> 02:42:44.885]  Surprise, surprise, surprise, Sergeant.
[02:42:47.045 --> 02:42:48.847]  Surprise, surprise, surprise.
[02:42:49.888 --> 02:43:00.859]  Kit Daniels found out something about the judge that set the date with three unnamed witnesses from 22 years ago that saw Donald Trump raping Jack Frost.
[02:43:02.020 --> 02:43:03.561]  Kit Daniels from Infowars.com.
[02:43:03.601 --> 02:43:04.562]  Tell folks what you've discovered.
[02:43:05.203 --> 02:43:06.284]  People can check it out for themselves.
[02:43:06.304 --> 02:43:07.505]  We're getting an article going up very, very soon.
[02:43:07.525 --> 02:43:07.886]  Kit Daniels.
[02:43:08.325 --> 02:43:25.989]  Yeah Alex, I thought it was a little weird that only hours after you put out that viral video on how the Democrats, particularly the Hillary campaign, was about to launch this rape allegations against Trump, we have this federal judge that unusually she signs off on this lawsuit during the weekend.
[02:43:26.550 --> 02:43:31.371]  So I looked her up and it said that Abrams, the judge, Ronnie Abrams,
[02:43:32.489 --> 02:43:44.819]  She was appointed by President Barack Obama, formally nominated and appointed for the Southern District of New York in 2011, after she was recommended for the position by the Democratic Senator from New York.
[02:43:45.700 --> 02:43:46.700]  Which is Hillary Clinton.
[02:43:47.181 --> 02:43:50.544]  Well yeah, well actually it was the new one, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.
[02:43:50.984 --> 02:43:54.747]  But Kirsten Gillibrand actually took over the vacancy left by Hillary Clinton.
[02:43:54.767 --> 02:43:56.388]  That's what I mean, yeah, that's still her spot, yeah.
[02:43:56.629 --> 02:43:56.869]  Yeah.
[02:43:57.669 --> 02:44:01.572]  So it's just this whole, and I looked at the lawsuit myself, and
[02:44:03.143 --> 02:44:08.186]  I just, I've done like four or five different articles over the past three years on various lawsuits.
[02:44:08.487 --> 02:44:09.808]  So I'm used to reading lawsuits.
[02:44:09.848 --> 02:44:17.713]  No, that's why when Trump comes out and says, this guy's a La Reconquista, he was heading up the La Reconquista Hispanic Ku Klux Klan organization.
[02:44:18.253 --> 02:44:21.135]  But Trump wasn't, I don't want to say eloquent enough, but just threw it out there.
[02:44:21.175 --> 02:44:22.016]  Yeah, he's a Mexican.
[02:44:22.236 --> 02:44:24.838]  He wants, and Trump says, no, there are Mexicans that are American.
[02:44:25.078 --> 02:44:25.999]  This guy's from Mexico.
[02:44:26.019 --> 02:44:27.219]  Because the guy is.
[02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:30.802]  But see, he doesn't put it out where it's all calculated.
[02:44:30.862 --> 02:44:31.903]  That's why they cut him to pieces.
[02:44:32.563 --> 02:44:39.848]  Yeah, you've got to look past the smoke screen and realize that there's political motivations about the people that are attacking Trump.
[02:44:40.048 --> 02:44:40.488]  Absolutely.
[02:44:40.508 --> 02:44:43.270]  Well listen, bring me that Wikipedia and I want to show this to folks.
[02:44:43.290 --> 02:44:44.471]  I've got a new article coming out on this.
[02:44:44.511 --> 02:44:45.592]  Let's get it out as soon as possible.
[02:44:45.612 --> 02:44:46.132]  Anything else, Kit?
[02:44:46.472 --> 02:44:47.133]  That's it, Alex.
[02:44:47.433 --> 02:44:47.653]  Thank you.
[02:44:47.673 --> 02:44:48.414]  Bring it on in, my friend.
[02:44:48.874 --> 02:44:51.516]  He's in our control room with evil racist George Washington behind him.
[02:44:52.737 --> 02:44:54.258]  So, all of this is unfolding.
[02:44:54.598 --> 02:44:55.719]  You can see it in real time.
[02:44:55.799 --> 02:44:58.821]  A judge appointed by Obama.
[02:44:59.901 --> 02:45:02.183]  Recommended the former district controlled by the Clintons.
[02:45:02.203 --> 02:45:03.124]  Yeah, just bring the paper on.
[02:45:03.164 --> 02:45:03.604]  It's fine, kid.
[02:45:03.624 --> 02:45:04.205]  You can walk it on air.
[02:45:04.225 --> 02:45:04.485]  It's fine.
[02:45:04.505 --> 02:45:04.965]  Bring it on into me.
[02:45:05.626 --> 02:45:08.588]  You've got all this unfolding, all this, you know, happening.
[02:45:10.009 --> 02:45:11.811]  And it's just, you can see how it's all staged.
[02:45:11.831 --> 02:45:13.652]  And then tomorrow, notice you've heard nothing about it.
[02:45:14.533 --> 02:45:15.433]  I told you yesterday.
[02:45:15.974 --> 02:45:16.254]  Watch.
[02:45:16.294 --> 02:45:24.461]  Tomorrow, they're going to announce a book out of the blue that's interviewed the Jane Does about Trump raping the little girl.
[02:45:26.803 --> 02:45:35.206]  Just like there was the daughter of the ambassador, they didn't tell you that on C-SPAN, that they saw Saddam take the babies out of the incubators and stomp their brains out.
[02:45:35.286 --> 02:45:36.006]  None of it was true.
[02:45:36.887 --> 02:45:37.667]  Saddam a great guy?
[02:45:37.707 --> 02:45:38.928]  No, but he was installed by the CIA.
[02:45:39.308 --> 02:45:42.369]  Much better than, you know, the people that came after it.
[02:45:43.029 --> 02:45:50.032]  And it just makes your head spin to see this magnitude of garbage unfolding.
[02:45:51.112 --> 02:45:52.653]  And this is the hour of hoaxes.
[02:45:52.693 --> 02:45:55.013]  This is the hour of disinformation.
[02:45:55.033 --> 02:45:57.594]  You've got him on the plane 20-something times with Jerry Epstein.
[02:45:58.615 --> 02:46:00.735]  You've got him going to the pedophile island, Bill Clinton.
[02:46:01.096 --> 02:46:03.016]  You've got Hillary representing pedophiles.
[02:46:03.036 --> 02:46:04.977]  You've got Bill Clinton settling rape cases.
[02:46:05.077 --> 02:46:05.957]  None of that matters!
[02:46:06.498 --> 02:46:07.518]  Jane Doe!
[02:46:07.618 --> 02:46:08.678]  Two minutes to midnight.
[02:46:09.379 --> 02:46:09.779]  29 days.
[02:46:09.799 --> 02:46:10.899]  It'll be 28 tomorrow.
[02:46:11.339 --> 02:46:13.360]  The book will suddenly be everywhere!
[02:46:14.761 --> 02:46:18.702]  Imaginary people say green men from Mars were raping children with Donald Trump.
[02:46:22.369 --> 02:46:33.014]  Now, Jeremy Spangle of Twitter.com forward slash Spanglevision has been doing the analysis that's later been confirmed of not one, not two.
[02:46:33.094 --> 02:46:34.535]  We've been going in and scanning as well.
[02:46:34.655 --> 02:46:47.801]  Others with the human element, the human intelligence are scanning this fake town hall she had a few weeks ago that they aired like it was real with a bunch of extras, a bunch of actors, a bunch of Democratic Party operatives in a staged event.
[02:46:47.841 --> 02:46:50.502]  That way if she has a convulsion, they can cover it up.
[02:46:52.364 --> 02:46:55.186]  And they've even got a famous Hollywood actress running the whole thing.
[02:46:55.706 --> 02:46:59.548]  So you talk about the running man of your radio lister and we've obviously covered this in detail.
[02:46:59.828 --> 02:47:01.970]  Just Google Hillary caught using child actors.
[02:47:03.331 --> 02:47:04.171]  And this gets creepy.
[02:47:04.191 --> 02:47:08.694]  She's in anti-gun videos too about how cool Bill Clinton is and how much she likes him.
[02:47:10.575 --> 02:47:13.076]  And then she was in a movie about kidnapped children.
[02:47:13.556 --> 02:47:14.597]  Kidnapped little girls.
[02:47:14.677 --> 02:47:15.518]  Kidnapped by a man.
[02:47:16.536 --> 02:47:29.273]  So there's definitely just a lot of weirdness going on here, and Jeremy Spangle, who I've said I'm going to be an auxiliary reporter for his bare minimum, does a great analysis of this at Twitter.com forward slash Spanglevision.
[02:47:29.293 --> 02:47:30.334]  I know his last name was Spangle.
[02:47:30.635 --> 02:47:33.879]  I figured it was some play of words of like the star Spangled Banner.
[02:47:34.900 --> 02:47:39.962]  But it's definitely great to have him with us and to be joining us.
[02:47:39.982 --> 02:47:45.483]  You can follow him again at Spanglevision, S-P-A-N-G-L-E-V-I-S-O-N.
[02:47:45.964 --> 02:47:47.864]  And we'll also tweet that out at InfoWars.com.
[02:47:47.884 --> 02:47:48.644]  We need to tweet though.
[02:47:48.664 --> 02:47:49.064]  Did we tweet?
[02:47:49.425 --> 02:48:02.008]  What I said, just to make sure we're so busy, that Insider, Hillary Clinton, you heard it here first, will refuse to shake Trump's hand tonight during the debate.
[02:48:02.629 --> 02:48:03.429]  Do we have that out there?
[02:48:05.657 --> 02:48:06.097]  Good, good, good.
[02:48:06.117 --> 02:48:06.937]  I want to put it on screen.
[02:48:07.618 --> 02:48:13.580]  And I also just want to point out that we have more protesters we haven't shown taunting Hillary about rape, you know, outside the event.
[02:48:13.620 --> 02:48:14.700]  They are besieged.
[02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:16.240]  They are under siege.
[02:48:16.801 --> 02:48:20.042]  So you want to have the media have a blackout and fire anybody or blackball anybody?
[02:48:20.242 --> 02:48:20.902]  That's been admitted.
[02:48:21.442 --> 02:48:24.083]  Who talks about Bill Clinton rape and you want to make up stuff about Trump?
[02:48:27.338 --> 02:48:32.521]  Notice they didn't go and have somebody else separate from Epstein claim it was really Trump, not Clinton.
[02:48:33.021 --> 02:48:34.823]  They knew Trump was planning this.
[02:48:35.583 --> 02:48:37.904]  And so they went and cooked it up on him!
[02:48:38.485 --> 02:48:39.285]  Whoa!
[02:48:39.505 --> 02:48:41.186]  I mean, this is amazing!
[02:48:41.667 --> 02:48:46.990]  With a judge appointed by Obama in Hillary's district, in New York,
[02:48:48.769 --> 02:48:54.812]  Right before the election, and the media will not tell their viewers a thing, but their viewers will find out about it.
[02:48:55.373 --> 02:48:56.853]  Or they'll find out about one of the other big lies.
[02:48:57.634 --> 02:48:57.994]  You know what?
[02:48:58.034 --> 02:48:59.495]  Trump's mic was turned off for the crowd.
[02:48:59.515 --> 02:49:00.655]  It was being faded up and down.
[02:49:00.896 --> 02:49:02.036]  The debate commission admits it.
[02:49:02.416 --> 02:49:03.457]  They are rigging the polls.
[02:49:03.477 --> 02:49:04.377]  They are rigging Google.
[02:49:04.397 --> 02:49:05.218]  They are rigging it.
[02:49:05.238 --> 02:49:13.102]  To their own detriment, because even if they defeat Trump, it's almost even better, because we fight, we fight, we fight, they cheat, they steal it, and they're all discredited even more.
[02:49:13.142 --> 02:49:16.424]  They have a periodic victory, which means a victory, you lose the battle.
[02:49:18.322 --> 02:49:21.326]  You're the patriot, but the enemy that wins it ends up collapsing because of it.
[02:49:21.887 --> 02:49:23.489]  They win the battle, but they lose the war.
[02:49:23.850 --> 02:49:25.171]  A Pyrrhic victory.
[02:49:25.672 --> 02:49:26.894]  Resistance is victory.
[02:49:26.954 --> 02:49:27.975]  We have the right on our side.
[02:49:28.456 --> 02:49:33.904]  So, Jeremy Spangl, joining us till the end of the hour and a little bit into the next, because we're commercial free now.
[02:49:34.404 --> 02:49:36.826]  A lot of stations are tearing as they go to break whenever they feel like it.
[02:49:37.086 --> 02:49:38.307]  But this is commercial free right now.
[02:49:38.427 --> 02:49:40.529]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:49:40.689 --> 02:49:41.670]  Listeners spread that link everywhere.
[02:49:42.090 --> 02:49:42.411]  Wow!
[02:49:42.851 --> 02:49:45.433]  Do you want to come commentate on what you just heard us talk about?
[02:49:45.793 --> 02:49:50.097]  Or this latest little girl that comes out that's an actress in other Democratic Party ads?
[02:49:50.637 --> 02:49:51.778]  I mean, where should we begin here?
[02:49:51.798 --> 02:49:52.819]  I mean, you talk about a facade.
[02:49:52.919 --> 02:49:57.903]  Imagine if Donald Trump got caught with fake town halls with fake actresses.
[02:49:57.923 --> 02:50:00.626]  What do you think is going on here, Jeremy?
[02:50:01.326 --> 02:50:02.706]  Yeah, we wouldn't hear the end of it.
[02:50:03.006 --> 02:50:07.487]  It would be constant news coverage of that.
[02:50:07.667 --> 02:50:12.448]  But I don't know what to think of it.
[02:50:12.628 --> 02:50:26.610]  I just want to say I was listening to you about a month ago and you kind of made a call to arms to get all those info warriors out there doing what they can.
[02:50:28.071 --> 02:50:30.151]  And let's say on
[02:50:32.403 --> 02:50:37.931]  Tuesday, I saw Hillary's camp tweeted that they had a live town hall on Facebook.
[02:50:37.971 --> 02:50:47.043]  So I started watching it and as soon as that first questioner got on the air and asked her question, it just didn't sit well with me.
[02:50:47.103 --> 02:50:47.965]  I knew something was up.
[02:50:50.137 --> 02:50:51.378]  And again, you were proven right.
[02:50:51.818 --> 02:50:54.941]  That's the subconscious that's hundreds of times more powerful, admittedly.
[02:50:55.201 --> 02:50:58.043]  Some say thousands, depending on the person, than the conscious brain.
[02:50:58.263 --> 02:50:58.923]  It looks fake.
[02:50:58.984 --> 02:50:59.524]  It looks staged.
[02:50:59.544 --> 02:51:00.244]  There's an actress.
[02:51:00.485 --> 02:51:01.065]  It looks weird.
[02:51:01.085 --> 02:51:02.566]  I mean, you can tell when a movie's a movie.
[02:51:02.586 --> 02:51:06.209]  I mean, you know the Godfather's not real, because it looks so slick and so real.
[02:51:06.689 --> 02:51:09.411]  You know when something's really a home movie, because it's a home movie.
[02:51:09.891 --> 02:51:14.415]  And, you know, you can see they even shot it so slick, it was meant to look real, but it wasn't.
[02:51:14.855 --> 02:51:17.777]  And the audio, and the scripting, and the little girl with the red bow!
[02:51:17.797 --> 02:51:24.963]  It's like the fake preachers that, you know, have the radios saying, she's got bad teeth in the front and arthritis because they fell out of form.
[02:51:25.223 --> 02:51:26.664]  I mean, this was beyond that.
[02:51:27.004 --> 02:51:28.005]  Truly exploitive.
[02:51:28.085 --> 02:51:29.907]  And so, you start digging, tell us what you found.
[02:51:31.707 --> 02:51:33.449]  So I'll just walk you through the process.
[02:51:33.469 --> 02:51:37.372]  You know, I didn't know the girl's last name.
[02:51:38.433 --> 02:51:40.094]  She introduced herself as Brennan.
[02:51:40.134 --> 02:51:43.517]  So I mean, it was just simple on the surface Google searching.
[02:51:44.498 --> 02:51:50.043]  And Brennan, just did a search for Brennan and Hillary Town Hall.
[02:51:50.403 --> 02:51:53.986]  And to my surprise, the mainstream media was
[02:51:54.767 --> 02:51:55.867]  They were reporting on it.
[02:51:56.047 --> 02:51:59.309]  You know, for them, it was a, it was an anti-Trump story.
[02:51:59.369 --> 02:52:06.991]  So that's all they were talking about and how this 15 year old girl just, um, trounced Trump.
[02:52:07.331 --> 02:52:12.913]  And, um, but it was, it was those articles that disclosed her, her last name.
[02:52:13.373 --> 02:52:20.196]  And from there, it just, I found an IMDB page and the light bulb went off in my head that this girl is an actress.
[02:52:21.375 --> 02:52:28.478]  Yeah, in a pretty big film, in commercials, um, the child kidnapping genre.
[02:52:30.258 --> 02:52:30.858]  It's insane.
[02:52:31.439 --> 02:52:34.300]  And, uh, yeah, I found, I found the movie.
[02:52:34.320 --> 02:52:36.260]  Then we found out Daddy was somebody, didn't we?
[02:52:36.921 --> 02:52:37.281]  We did.
[02:52:37.301 --> 02:52:38.321]  I didn't find that out.
[02:52:38.581 --> 02:52:40.702]  Uh, there's some Redditors that just go through that.
[02:52:40.962 --> 02:52:46.264]  You hit the first domino, then more people on Reddit on the Donald's found more, then other people found more actors.
[02:52:48.171 --> 02:52:50.452]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:52:50.492 --> 02:52:54.915]  By the way, anything you look at, you're going to find crime and deception with these people because they're so dirty.
[02:52:55.475 --> 02:53:02.899]  It's the nature of psychopaths, I'm not saying she is, but the handlers, to always create something fake because they don't have a real personality.
[02:53:03.160 --> 02:53:04.140]  So they don't know what to do.
[02:53:04.200 --> 02:53:05.401]  They've got to construct something.
[02:53:05.541 --> 02:53:07.022]  That's why they're obsessed with thespian.
[02:53:07.222 --> 02:53:08.243]  Glenn Beck is obsessed.
[02:53:08.303 --> 02:53:10.184]  Everything's an act because there's no one there.
[02:53:12.325 --> 02:53:15.507]  Yeah, I couldn't believe how
[02:53:16.997 --> 02:53:28.866]  Just scratching on the surface, I was able to uncover this and I had somebody comment on the video about how this just shows how much the mainstream media is in bed with Hillary.
[02:53:29.226 --> 02:53:34.671]  I mean, if they were doing their jobs, it wouldn't have taken, it wouldn't have taken them 30 minutes to find out.
[02:53:34.691 --> 02:53:39.234]  I've been told by media folks that since we have the secret, of course we know she's having convulsions all the time, but she's better than Trump.
[02:53:39.514 --> 02:53:40.955]  They know she's having these.
[02:53:41.696 --> 02:53:44.238]  The Secret Service just said, start following around, happens all the time.
[02:53:44.258 --> 02:53:45.659]  And then it happened.
[02:53:47.096 --> 02:53:47.317]  Yeah.
[02:53:48.479 --> 02:53:57.019]  And it goes to show you how important the everyday person is in this fight because it wasn't the media that recorded her on that curb.
[02:53:58.400 --> 02:54:00.400]  It was, it was... And again, that's why you're here.
[02:54:00.580 --> 02:54:01.641]  You are the future.
[02:54:01.741 --> 02:54:02.761]  You are the resistance.
[02:54:03.221 --> 02:54:04.741]  We're not just as good as the mainstream.
[02:54:04.801 --> 02:54:06.782]  We're willing to tell the truth and just show what happened.
[02:54:07.162 --> 02:54:08.322]  Chips fall where they may.
[02:54:08.922 --> 02:54:11.122]  If I had video of her jumping rope, I'd say, hey, she looks great.
[02:54:11.602 --> 02:54:12.623]  But we tell it like it is.
[02:54:12.723 --> 02:54:18.084]  And the thing is, no matter what happens to me or you, as more people get involved, no matter what happens with this election, we are their downfall.
[02:54:19.844 --> 02:54:22.304]  It's our responsibility because nobody else is going to do it.
[02:54:22.344 --> 02:54:25.245]  If we don't do it, Hillary's in, you know.
[02:54:26.607 --> 02:54:27.747]  Well listen, you're a polite guy.
[02:54:27.767 --> 02:54:29.168]  I want to give you like ten minutes to yourself.
[02:54:29.228 --> 02:54:30.008]  You've got the floor.
[02:54:30.428 --> 02:54:31.649]  Talk about what you think of the world.
[02:54:31.689 --> 02:54:31.889]  Why?
[02:54:31.929 --> 02:54:33.250]  I didn't know you were spurred by us.
[02:54:33.330 --> 02:54:36.591]  It's very humbling that nine times out of ten, literally, folks are spurred by this show.
[02:54:36.891 --> 02:54:38.892]  Because despite all my faults, I'm excited.
[02:54:38.932 --> 02:54:39.372]  I'm awake.
[02:54:39.612 --> 02:54:41.573]  I tend to have that wavelength of getting people out of a trance.
[02:54:41.953 --> 02:54:43.794]  You weren't in a trance, but it spurred you to action.
[02:54:44.034 --> 02:54:45.494]  Let's have you spur others to action.
[02:54:45.814 --> 02:54:46.535]  Just take over!
[02:54:46.755 --> 02:54:47.995]  What do we do to fight this tyranny?
[02:54:49.936 --> 02:54:51.216]  Just be vigilant.
[02:54:51.717 --> 02:54:53.097]  Keep your ears and eyes open.
[02:54:53.157 --> 02:54:54.218]  And if you see anything,
[02:54:56.306 --> 02:54:57.087]  Start digging.
[02:54:58.188 --> 02:54:58.829]  It's not hard.
[02:55:00.230 --> 02:55:02.172]  10 minutes, that's a tall order.
[02:55:02.212 --> 02:55:10.301]  I don't know that I can run the floor for 10 minutes, but if I can do it, anybody can do it.
[02:55:11.522 --> 02:55:13.144]  Keep your eyes and ears open for sure.
[02:55:15.560 --> 02:55:20.946]  Well, we've had the mantra that Hillary for President has been the mantra they've had in the campaign for the last six months.
[02:55:21.006 --> 02:55:25.971]  Now, the mantra is, new mantra in presidential contest, rape, world net daily.
[02:55:26.372 --> 02:55:27.193]  What do you make of that?
[02:55:27.233 --> 02:55:34.280]  I mean, they want to send people to rallies to claim he's racist with no evidence, and now they want to say he rapes little girls with Jane Doe saying it.
[02:55:34.520 --> 02:55:36.523]  Well, Bill Clinton settled rape cases, we're going to say it then.
[02:55:38.137 --> 02:55:42.540]  Yeah, well it just goes to show you that they don't have, there's no boundaries.
[02:55:42.560 --> 02:55:47.583]  The gloves are off and it's time for Trump to fight back just as hard.
[02:55:47.723 --> 02:55:53.106]  You know, it seems like in that first debate, you know, he wanted to appear presidential and he refrained.
[02:55:54.107 --> 02:55:57.229]  Well, I found out Hillary reached out to the Daughters and they asked him, he got set up.
[02:55:57.289 --> 02:55:58.410]  I can't believe he did it, but go ahead.
[02:55:58.950 --> 02:56:01.311]  Well, you know, tonight's his redemption.
[02:56:03.312 --> 02:56:04.913]  The future of our country is on the line.
[02:56:05.313 --> 02:56:14.057]  And, you know, when I see Hillary staging town halls, you know, it infuriates me.
[02:56:14.097 --> 02:56:16.238]  It upsets me because this is my country.
[02:56:16.318 --> 02:56:17.519]  It's like The Running Man.
[02:56:17.579 --> 02:56:20.360]  I mean, in The Running Man, when they find out it's fake, the dictatorship is overthrown.
[02:56:22.121 --> 02:56:22.661]  It's crazy.
[02:56:22.701 --> 02:56:23.922]  You can't make this stuff up.
[02:56:26.535 --> 02:56:29.956]  It's crazier than science fiction, and it's happening right now.
[02:56:29.976 --> 02:56:32.757]  And you know what that tells me, Mr. Spangle?
[02:56:32.777 --> 02:56:33.598]  They're going for broke.
[02:56:33.638 --> 02:56:34.818]  We've got to expose them.
[02:56:34.838 --> 02:56:35.558]  We've got to fight them.
[02:56:36.759 --> 02:56:37.259]  We have to.
[02:56:38.139 --> 02:56:39.120]  Our country's on the line.
[02:56:41.786 --> 02:56:46.051]  Well, you're making some great points, and I really want to get some auxiliary reporters that are paid positions.
[02:56:46.071 --> 02:56:50.236]  Our budget isn't huge, but we've got the budget for three or four full-time, five or six other part-time.
[02:56:50.256 --> 02:56:54.520]  But I'd love to, if you can find a camera crew, we'd pay some folks or have you do analysis or points.
[02:56:54.941 --> 02:56:56.442]  We'd love to have you develop in that.
[02:56:57.023 --> 02:56:58.844]  We're going to move forward, maybe get you here full time.
[02:56:59.125 --> 02:57:01.386]  That's all to listeners supporting us and spreading the word.
[02:57:01.406 --> 02:57:05.429]  But we have a great responsibility to have great analysts like you out there taking action.
[02:57:05.469 --> 02:57:08.031]  So it's very, very exciting to see you doing this, my friend.
[02:57:08.651 --> 02:57:10.573]  What are your predictions, your gut level feelings?
[02:57:10.593 --> 02:57:22.781]  I mean, if they turned his mic off to the crowd, faded it down to TV viewers, if they asked, interrupted him 40 plus times, her six times, you know, pinch 60 something times, the other guy four times, cane.
[02:57:22.801 --> 02:57:24.443]  I mean, my God, this is going to be a
[02:57:24.963 --> 02:57:30.266]  Double team, where there's two reporters attacking him, one CIA, the other rat lady, and then you're going to have Hillary.
[02:57:30.306 --> 02:57:31.166]  That's three to one.
[02:57:31.186 --> 02:57:32.747]  I mean, I hope Trump calls this out.
[02:57:33.287 --> 02:57:33.868]  He has to.
[02:57:34.008 --> 02:57:35.188]  It's not going to be any different.
[02:57:35.429 --> 02:57:37.390]  I mean, it's hosted by Anderson Cooper.
[02:57:37.970 --> 02:57:41.752]  You couldn't get a more pro-Hillary moderator.
[02:57:42.112 --> 02:57:53.258]  So he's going to have to, he's just going to have to take the bull by the horns and, you know, do what he does best, what got him to the
[02:57:54.105 --> 02:57:56.647]  Republican nomination.
[02:57:56.708 --> 02:57:58.930]  So he's, he's capable.
[02:57:59.510 --> 02:58:03.794]  I'm, I'm optimistic and confident that he's going to shine tonight.
[02:58:03.834 --> 02:58:09.199]  You know, the first, that first debate was, was him just testing the water.
[02:58:09.279 --> 02:58:12.823]  So I, I'm optimistic that it's going to be a good night for him.
[02:58:14.141 --> 02:58:16.663]  Damn the Maneuvers and go straight at him.
[02:58:17.204 --> 02:58:18.425]  Which British Lord was that?
[02:58:19.246 --> 02:58:20.707]  That wasn't Lord Acton.
[02:58:20.727 --> 02:58:23.249]  That was Power Krebs, absolute Power Krebs, absolutely.
[02:58:23.269 --> 02:58:25.411]  It was Lord Nelson, I believe.
[02:58:25.431 --> 02:58:27.133]  Damn the Maneuvers, just go straight at him.
[02:58:29.035 --> 02:58:30.856]  Listen, I really appreciate where he lost.
[02:58:31.116 --> 02:58:33.659]  He died in that battle, but won that war.
[02:58:33.679 --> 02:58:35.300]  Won that naval engagement, that war.
[02:58:36.466 --> 02:58:37.607]  But it was the Battle of the Nile.
[02:58:38.087 --> 02:58:39.507]  But listen, you're doing a great job.
[02:58:39.567 --> 02:58:41.308]  I cannot tell you what a rock star you are to us.
[02:58:41.368 --> 02:58:42.409]  Everybody that takes action.
[02:58:42.649 --> 02:58:46.551]  These folks that go and scream Hillary's a rapist or whatever with all these enemies around them.
[02:58:46.891 --> 02:58:49.172]  This is the future and it's very very exciting.
[02:58:49.732 --> 02:58:50.672]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:58:50.692 --> 02:58:51.653]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:58:52.529 --> 02:58:55.711]  Alright, we will talk to more folks in the future, but that was Jeremy Spangler.
[02:58:55.731 --> 02:58:57.012]  Hey Alex, I want to break in real quick.
[02:58:57.052 --> 02:59:02.176]  It looks like Trump is right now having a press conference with all these rape victims of Bill Clinton.
[02:59:02.236 --> 02:59:04.018]  It's on the top left of Drudge.
[02:59:04.038 --> 02:59:04.658]  It's a red link.
[02:59:05.399 --> 02:59:05.879]  Let's show it.
[02:59:05.899 --> 02:59:07.220]  Let's go to DrudgeReport.com.
[02:59:07.240 --> 02:59:10.342]  Let's put some of that up with him right now.
[02:59:10.382 --> 02:59:11.383]  Absolutely devastating.
[02:59:11.523 --> 02:59:12.624]  I knew he had to launch first.
[02:59:12.664 --> 02:59:14.686]  This shows he is going to turbo her.
[02:59:15.246 --> 02:59:16.607]  He is going to go straight for the jugular.
[02:59:21.943 --> 02:59:24.184]  So I don't know if it's started yet, but... No, it just started.
[02:59:24.204 --> 02:59:26.105]  Let's get this press conference.
[02:59:26.445 --> 02:59:28.926]  And then we're going to get our next guest lined up while this happens.
[02:59:28.946 --> 02:59:31.967]  He got up there and yelled, Bill Clinton's a rapist in Nevada.
[02:59:32.047 --> 02:59:32.887]  It was Nevada.
[02:59:34.008 --> 02:59:35.789]  And really took over the strongest of anybody.
[02:59:37.549 --> 02:59:40.631]  So he's done a sneak attack press conference with the ladies.
[02:59:41.271 --> 02:59:43.632]  The 12-year-old that got raped, she's going to be there tonight.
[02:59:44.432 --> 02:59:48.015]  Uh, in the front row, and Hillary accuses him of, you know, joking about grabbing a lady.
[02:59:48.895 --> 02:59:51.457]  So, uh... Oh, he didn't say I grabbed a lady by the you-know-what.
[02:59:51.517 --> 02:59:52.778]  Oh, that lady sitting right next to Trump.
[02:59:52.978 --> 02:59:53.478]  Yeah, there she is.
[02:59:53.498 --> 02:59:54.419]  She's sitting right next to Trump.
[02:59:54.439 --> 02:59:57.060]  These four very courageous women have... Kathy Shelton.
[02:59:57.080 --> 02:59:57.641]  Here's Donald Trump.
[02:59:58.121 --> 03:00:00.643]  ...be here, and it was our honor to help them.
[03:00:01.643 --> 03:00:09.829]  And I think they reached out to make just an individual short statement, and then we will put up a little meeting, and we'll see you at the debate.
[03:00:11.710 --> 03:00:12.791]  Perhaps we'll start with Paul.
[03:00:13.422 --> 03:00:17.163]  Well, I'm here to support Mr. Trump because he's going to make America great again.
[03:00:17.763 --> 03:00:20.464]  Heck, man, I think everybody else should vote for him.
[03:00:21.104 --> 03:00:26.085]  And I think they should all look at the fact that he's a good person.
[03:00:26.145 --> 03:00:31.547]  He's not what other people have been saying he's been, like Hillary.
[03:00:31.747 --> 03:00:32.967]  So, think about that.
[03:00:35.948 --> 03:00:36.788]  Kathy Shelton?
[03:00:37.788 --> 03:00:39.409]  I'm also here to support Trump.
[03:00:41.354 --> 03:00:49.920]  At 12 years old, Hillary put me through something that you would never put a 12-year-old through.
[03:00:50.860 --> 03:00:53.722]  And she says she's for women and children.
[03:00:54.683 --> 03:01:01.227]  And she was asked last year on what happened, and she says she's supposed to defend whether they did it or not.
[03:01:01.267 --> 03:01:04.149]  And now she's laughing on tape, saying she know they did it.
[03:01:07.391 --> 03:01:08.732]  You went through the room?
[03:01:08.752 --> 03:01:09.613]  Yes, yes, sir, I did.
[03:01:12.032 --> 03:01:12.352]  Okay.
[03:01:12.752 --> 03:01:17.073]  Hi, I'm Winnie the Broderick, and I'm here to support Donald Trump.
[03:01:18.133 --> 03:01:24.375]  I tweeted recently, and Mr. Trump retweeted it, that actions speak louder than words.
[03:01:25.875 --> 03:01:34.777]  Mr. Trump may have said some bad words, but Bill Clinton raped me, and Hillary Clinton threatened me.
[03:01:35.798 --> 03:01:37.498]  I don't think there's any comparison.
[03:01:43.087 --> 03:01:48.756]  I am here to support Donald Trump.
[03:01:50.899 --> 03:01:56.088]  The reason for that is the first day that he announced the president, he said,
[03:01:56.869 --> 03:02:00.273]  I love this country, and I want America to be great again.
[03:02:01.134 --> 03:02:06.339]  And I cried when he said that, because I think that this is the greatest country in the world.
[03:02:06.920 --> 03:02:08.902]  I think that we can do anything.
[03:02:09.182 --> 03:02:11.044]  I think we can accomplish anything.
[03:02:11.745 --> 03:02:14.128]  I think that we can bring peace to this world.
[03:02:14.548 --> 03:02:18.773]  And I think Donald Trump can lead us to that point.
[03:02:22.353 --> 03:02:23.594]  Okay, thank you all very much.
[03:02:23.635 --> 03:02:24.696]  We appreciate it.
[03:02:24.716 --> 03:02:26.497]  Why don't y'all ask Bill Clinton that?
[03:02:26.517 --> 03:02:28.759]  Why don't y'all go ask Bill Clinton that?
[03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:30.001]  Go ahead and ask Hillary as well!
[03:02:45.492 --> 03:02:54.274]  Alright, that just happened minutes ago, it's already got a half a million views, which again, we have millions tuning in via our streams, YouTube, we have the backups and forwards.com forward slash show.
[03:02:55.395 --> 03:03:00.356]  It took me 20 years to build up 3 million listeners a day on Terrestrial Radio.
[03:03:00.896 --> 03:03:03.657]  Now we get 5 million views a day just from my show on YouTube.
[03:03:03.737 --> 03:03:05.437]  I mean, it's getting insane.
[03:03:05.457 --> 03:03:06.578]  5 billion on YouTube total.
[03:03:07.698 --> 03:03:11.579]  I have reporters that routinely have videos every week that get 5 to 10 to 20 million views apiece.
[03:03:12.469 --> 03:03:14.151]  McBrain gets one almost every week with over a million.
[03:03:14.351 --> 03:03:15.953]  Paul Watson videos every week with 5 million.
[03:03:16.133 --> 03:03:18.396]  Routinely 16, 17, 18, 20 million.
[03:03:19.717 --> 03:03:23.561]  And we are dominating all over the place on ratings on terrestrial radio.
[03:03:24.142 --> 03:03:27.946]  Despite the fact that two conglomerates own 90% of the stations, we're basically on the ones they don't own.
[03:03:27.966 --> 03:03:31.310]  There's a few hundred that are privately owned, a lot of them big.
[03:03:31.470 --> 03:03:32.091]  We're on all of them.
[03:03:33.072 --> 03:03:33.292]  Okay?
[03:03:34.229 --> 03:03:36.132]  This is a total battle, a total war.
[03:03:36.152 --> 03:03:40.698]  Those Neocon talk show hosts, I'll be on a 5,000 water, beat their 50,000 water.
[03:03:41.218 --> 03:03:44.643]  Places like Orlando, Chicago, you name it.
[03:03:44.683 --> 03:03:46.005]  And again, it's not, oh, I'm a big guy.
[03:03:46.285 --> 03:03:47.607]  The truth is popular.
[03:03:48.127 --> 03:03:49.029]  These people aren't.
[03:03:50.762 --> 03:03:52.923]  We are 46 minutes out.
[03:03:52.943 --> 03:03:54.525]  I'm going to be out of here in about 10-15 minutes.
[03:03:54.545 --> 03:04:03.350]  I'm going to bring in Leon McAdoo, David Knight, and then I'm going to come in, and pretty much silently, but in case something happens during the debate, I'm going to be here, and then they're going to come in for a couple hours after Roger Stone's popping back in.
[03:04:03.671 --> 03:04:05.392]  Now, keep explaining this.
[03:04:06.292 --> 03:04:14.718]  I'm just an average guy that, I'm still not perfect on air, far from it, that 25 years ago started trying to get on radio, and got on radio 21 years ago.
[03:04:15.679 --> 03:04:16.039]  Locally.
[03:04:16.960 --> 03:04:18.721]  Started out on AXS TV, and I now reach
[03:04:20.532 --> 03:04:22.453]  It's like 30 million people a week, conservatively?
[03:04:23.914 --> 03:04:27.377]  Okay, so, I am spurring everybody to be activists.
[03:04:28.417 --> 03:04:31.819]  Start your local radio show, start an excellent show, start a blog, cover big issues.
[03:04:32.940 --> 03:04:36.262]  America, the future, Trump, globalism, the past, Hillary.
[03:04:36.883 --> 03:04:39.985]  Get aggressive, and whether he wins or loses, he's probably gonna win, they're gonna steal it.
[03:04:40.305 --> 03:04:42.006]  Doesn't matter, we have savaged the globalists.
[03:04:42.246 --> 03:04:43.387]  Their world government's out in the open.
[03:04:43.427 --> 03:04:46.609]  Nigel Farage just got UK out of the EU, the first phase.
[03:04:46.909 --> 03:04:47.930]  He's there advising Trump.
[03:04:48.230 --> 03:04:48.991]  Got that clip in a minute.
[03:04:49.898 --> 03:04:57.042]  That's why I'm so excited today and tomorrow, I'm going to have at least eight of the, now it's fourteen people, we're trying to get in touch with the others, mail checks out on Friday.
[03:04:57.603 --> 03:04:59.904]  And I didn't do it for the money, but I put prizes out to make it more fun.
[03:04:59.924 --> 03:05:10.130]  A thousand dollars, you get a Bill Clinton raped shirt out there, because they're blocking this on TV, they're censoring people, they're doing everything they can to not let these women that got raped and abused by Clinton get their word out.
[03:05:10.330 --> 03:05:10.911]  You just saw them.
[03:05:10.931 --> 03:05:12.392]  Believe me, I'm going to lose money on this.
[03:05:12.412 --> 03:05:14.593]  We're not going to sell a hundred thousand of these shirts.
[03:05:14.693 --> 03:05:16.894]  I mean, we have the Hillary for President, but not this one.
[03:05:17.754 --> 03:05:21.096]  And I said just 5,000 of you wear it and get raped out.
[03:05:21.136 --> 03:05:24.717]  This guy definitely is the most hardcore of all of them.
[03:05:24.757 --> 03:05:29.099]  The guy that did it first in New York, a little scared to come on, all this other stuff's going on.
[03:05:29.119 --> 03:05:35.602]  But I gotta tell you, I think this guy is the most bold, and I appreciate Richard Jarrett joining us.
[03:05:36.722 --> 03:05:38.163]  A little bit about Richard Jarrett.
[03:05:40.964 --> 03:05:43.825]  He's been a congressional district elected delegate.
[03:05:45.174 --> 03:05:47.335]  Democratic National Convention, Chicago, Illinois, 1996.
[03:05:47.955 --> 03:05:50.436]  Staffed Chicago Democratic Party.
[03:05:51.496 --> 03:05:55.338]  And a bunch of other... Executive Director, El Paso County Democratic, Colorado Springs.
[03:05:55.698 --> 03:05:56.739]  I'm not gonna go over his whole bio.
[03:05:57.899 --> 03:06:00.580]  But he's been elected National DNC Committee person.
[03:06:00.620 --> 03:06:01.340]  That's a big deal.
[03:06:02.161 --> 03:06:03.001]  National Delegate.
[03:06:03.021 --> 03:06:05.522]  I mean, he's been what I'd call mid-level Democratic Party.
[03:06:05.782 --> 03:06:07.603]  Maybe even upper-middle level.
[03:06:08.651 --> 03:06:11.075]  Uh, National Delegate, Democratic National Convention, it goes on and on.
[03:06:11.736 --> 03:06:15.944]  So this is a guy who, I said, we're all the real liberals that were against Bush and wars and all this evil.
[03:06:15.984 --> 03:06:17.427]  I mean, Hillary is worse, probably.
[03:06:18.108 --> 03:06:19.591]  And so, and I was against Bush.
[03:06:19.611 --> 03:06:20.592]  I mean, I'm a libertarian.
[03:06:22.452 --> 03:06:23.493]  Trump's kind of like a liberal.
[03:06:23.533 --> 03:06:24.033]  He doesn't get down to it.
[03:06:24.053 --> 03:06:24.874]  He's just not crazy.
[03:06:25.274 --> 03:06:27.916]  So some conservatives actually have a real issue on some points with him.
[03:06:27.956 --> 03:06:29.277]  I told you he didn't claim to be some angel.
[03:06:29.817 --> 03:06:30.918]  So I want to ask Richard Garrett.
[03:06:30.958 --> 03:06:31.879]  I've never talked to him yet.
[03:06:31.899 --> 03:06:32.679]  Appreciate him coming on.
[03:06:32.919 --> 03:06:33.760]  5,000th in the mail, brother.
[03:06:34.040 --> 03:06:34.500]  Great job.
[03:06:34.580 --> 03:06:35.481]  Why'd you do this?
[03:06:35.801 --> 03:06:37.142]  Where do you see this world going?
[03:06:37.442 --> 03:06:39.404]  And then in a moment, we're going to play the clip for folks that have missed it.
[03:06:40.248 --> 03:06:41.489]  Well, Alex, thanks for having me.
[03:06:44.730 --> 03:06:51.913]  I spent 20 years being sick of the Clinton crime family, and I have had enough.
[03:06:52.413 --> 03:06:56.095]  So I ordered this Clinton rape shirt.
[03:06:56.875 --> 03:07:08.520]  I went down and registered to vote for the first time since 96 after I saw all the disgusting things that I saw at that national convention with Bill Clinton in a closed door meeting on Friday, August 30th.
[03:07:10.194 --> 03:07:14.937]  And after that, I went down to the Hillary headquarters, got some buttons on.
[03:07:14.957 --> 03:07:18.980]  I went down to the outlet, got a nice shirt to put over my rape shirt.
[03:07:19.720 --> 03:07:20.761]  Got into the meeting.
[03:07:20.781 --> 03:07:26.845]  The brunette that took that other video, you know, that you said that was the wife.
[03:07:27.346 --> 03:07:30.428]  Actually, she wouldn't even talk to me because I was some stinking liberal.
[03:07:31.508 --> 03:07:33.710]  I mean, I was just guessing she was your wife or girlfriend.
[03:07:33.770 --> 03:07:34.771]  No, no, no.
[03:07:35.011 --> 03:07:42.758]  I tried to talk to her because she was like, you know, she worked in the medical field and she wouldn't even talk to me because I look, you know, she's like, I ain't talking to no liberal, you know.
[03:07:43.518 --> 03:07:46.421]  See, we should talk to liberals and wake them up, you know.
[03:07:46.781 --> 03:07:50.124]  So anyway, so all that video she shot was all coincidental.
[03:07:50.885 --> 03:07:56.369]  And that whole thing about when, uh, when, uh, when a creepy cane goes, well, you know,
[03:07:57.230 --> 03:08:00.071]  From Trump Tower, and then I go, Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[03:08:00.352 --> 03:08:03.173]  All that was going with what God gives you.
[03:08:04.013 --> 03:08:05.574]  And I was going with what God gives me.
[03:08:06.095 --> 03:08:09.776]  And just going for it, going all the way, and that's what you gotta do.
[03:08:09.796 --> 03:08:12.278]  You go rich through the vote, then you get out there and mix it up.
[03:08:12.298 --> 03:08:14.079]  Well, I'll tell you, it was powerful.
[03:08:14.139 --> 03:08:16.940]  The other guys, have you seen the new clip where Bill Clinton's also on the trail?
[03:08:17.240 --> 03:08:20.182]  And he says, and I'll tell you the whole secret of it, they go, yeah, you're a rapist.
[03:08:20.862 --> 03:08:24.565]  I mean, so you were a Democrat earlier on.
[03:08:24.785 --> 03:08:26.686]  I could see how back in the 90s it would seem more reasonable.
[03:08:27.047 --> 03:08:29.268]  Things weren't as clear then and probably the Republicans are bad as well.
[03:08:29.548 --> 03:08:31.270]  But you saw a bunch of stuff that really woke you up.
[03:08:31.290 --> 03:08:39.636]  I want to interview you later in the week for a full 30 minutes or so to get into that background and what woke you up and what happened in those secret meetings where the sausage is actually being made.
[03:08:39.676 --> 03:08:43.378]  But what do you make overall of this campaign and where this is going?
[03:08:46.573 --> 03:09:02.522]  We gotta get out there and tell these young people, right, that Bill Clinton is a rapist, a sexual predator, and one of the nastiest individuals on this planet.
[03:09:03.783 --> 03:09:11.868]  The things I saw at a closed door meeting the day after his nomination speech in 1996 on Friday was absolutely disgusting.
[03:09:11.908 --> 03:09:14.710]  Since you bring it up, let's talk about some of what you witnessed as a delegate.
[03:09:15.461 --> 03:09:26.461]  Well, the first thing I witnessed was on Monday or Tuesday when Hillary Clinton had a special video shoot.
[03:09:26.481 --> 03:09:27.963]  She was outside the United Center.
[03:09:29.297 --> 03:09:31.239]  And all the convention delegates were inside.
[03:09:31.259 --> 03:09:33.160]  And she goes, Hi, this is Hillary.
[03:09:33.460 --> 03:09:34.841]  I can't wait to see you guys.
[03:09:35.121 --> 03:09:37.182]  I'm so excited to be here in Chicago.
[03:09:37.202 --> 03:09:39.183]  I'll see you really soon.
[03:09:39.203 --> 03:09:40.664]  And then she snapped.
[03:09:41.245 --> 03:09:43.526]  She snapped into a bipolar rage.
[03:09:43.586 --> 03:09:45.327]  And she goes, Take this effing mic!
[03:09:45.607 --> 03:09:47.828]  And threw it right at the cameraman's face.
[03:09:49.129 --> 03:09:50.270]  And then the whole crowd went shhh.
[03:09:52.071 --> 03:09:52.952]  And they covered it up.
[03:09:53.372 --> 03:09:54.533]  It doesn't exist anywhere.
[03:09:54.893 --> 03:09:55.093]  You know?
[03:09:55.879 --> 03:10:01.303]  Then on Friday, the worst thing I ever saw was Bill Clinton.
[03:10:02.443 --> 03:10:04.285]  Matter of fact, all the people are right here.
[03:10:04.305 --> 03:10:05.285]  They're right here.
[03:10:06.346 --> 03:10:10.589]  Mainstream media, if you want to interview all these people, they're here in this book.
[03:10:11.069 --> 03:10:14.171]  The Delegates and Alternatives to the Democratic National Convention in 1996.
[03:10:14.211 --> 03:10:16.633]  Fairly easy to access.
[03:10:17.753 --> 03:10:23.317]  We can start with the Executive Committee, all those women that he groped, and all these people on his Rules Committee, and everything else.
[03:10:23.897 --> 03:10:24.458]  But anyway,
[03:10:26.035 --> 03:10:31.378]  I want to make a special appeal to someone that has given his life to civil rights.
[03:10:32.499 --> 03:10:36.261]  I sat, I was standing next to the Reverend Jesse Jackson.
[03:10:36.281 --> 03:10:43.506]  And he, there was a lady in a wheelchair and she was like stuck and she couldn't get through the line because people wouldn't let her.
[03:10:44.006 --> 03:10:48.388]  And so the Reverend Jackson moved these people out of the way, put her in front of the receiving line.
[03:10:50.310 --> 03:10:52.431]  And he said something I'll never forget.
[03:10:53.411 --> 03:10:55.413]  He said, watch his hands.
[03:10:56.823 --> 03:10:58.103]  Watch his hands.
[03:11:00.284 --> 03:11:08.186]  And he was up there in his closed door meeting with the media, groping, touching, fondling all these women.
[03:11:08.466 --> 03:11:10.287]  And everybody's just like, yay!
[03:11:10.327 --> 03:11:11.247]  Who was?
[03:11:11.607 --> 03:11:12.227]  Bill Clinton.
[03:11:12.887 --> 03:11:18.109]  Have you seen the videos of Joe Biden with little girls on TV, grabbing him, kissing him, telling him he wants to date him?
[03:11:18.869 --> 03:11:19.929]  Rob, do the video on this.
[03:11:19.949 --> 03:11:20.589]  I've never seen it.
[03:11:20.629 --> 03:11:21.249]  It blew me away.
[03:11:21.569 --> 03:11:22.910]  I didn't know he does this on TV.
[03:11:24.554 --> 03:11:25.394]  I'll tell you what, man.
[03:11:25.714 --> 03:11:28.055]  This is the bottom line.
[03:11:28.075 --> 03:11:40.820]  From the time Dick Morris went down in that tabloid and he had to resign, and then to the time that that drug brought out Monica Lewinsky, Bill Clinton was a serial
[03:11:42.586 --> 03:11:43.747]  Sexual predator.
[03:11:44.067 --> 03:11:51.053]  To be clear, you heard Jesse Jackson, I've talked to folks at NOM, despite the fact the stuff he does and all the women, these women he takes care of, adult women, he's had a few kids out of wedlock.
[03:11:51.413 --> 03:11:53.335]  I've heard he's pretty nice to people behind the scenes though.
[03:11:53.575 --> 03:11:56.678]  That's what you saw, he said, watch Bill Clinton's hands.
[03:11:58.119 --> 03:12:01.461]  He told a woman in a wheelchair, watch his hands.
[03:12:02.862 --> 03:12:04.783]  And I was like, what?
[03:12:05.384 --> 03:12:08.606]  And then the person that invited me, right?
[03:12:09.166 --> 03:12:15.389]  The person that invited me, we just sat there and watched in horror about how the hell is this guy grabbing all these women?
[03:12:15.409 --> 03:12:20.753]  He was grabbing deep, deep, deep down and just grabbing everything.
[03:12:20.773 --> 03:12:22.774]  Well, there's video of him grabbing stewardesses and everything else.
[03:12:22.794 --> 03:12:24.515]  Reportedly, Clinton has sex with 10 women a day.
[03:12:25.950 --> 03:12:27.751]  This was unbelievable.
[03:12:27.851 --> 03:12:29.252]  It was the day, it was August 30th.
[03:12:29.412 --> 03:12:32.034]  It was at a DNC committee person.
[03:12:32.174 --> 03:12:33.454]  So how does this compare to Trump?
[03:12:33.474 --> 03:12:34.995]  Because I admit, I don't like the way it sounds.
[03:12:35.355 --> 03:12:36.496]  But you can hear it's edited too.
[03:12:36.516 --> 03:12:37.957]  They're on a bus, he doesn't know it's being recorded.
[03:12:37.977 --> 03:12:41.999]  11 years ago he's joking about, these girls will let you grab their sons and suckers, you're famous.
[03:12:42.259 --> 03:12:43.860]  He didn't say I'm grabbing and he says they'd let you.
[03:12:43.880 --> 03:12:45.521]  I mean, okay, it's a little uncouth.
[03:12:45.761 --> 03:12:47.803]  We know we're not electing a saint here.
[03:12:48.023 --> 03:12:49.223]  He's never said he is.
[03:12:50.084 --> 03:12:51.285]  But we've never had allegations.
[03:12:51.305 --> 03:12:53.266]  I mean, what do you make of that?
[03:12:54.360 --> 03:13:01.727]  Well, all I know is that I heard on Fox News earlier that it's not about his jokes.
[03:13:01.827 --> 03:13:07.632]  It's about his, you know, talking about his talking about him making a sexual
[03:13:09.468 --> 03:13:16.593]  You know, talking about doing a sexual act, you know, being a sexual, doing a sexual assault, him talking about it.
[03:13:17.194 --> 03:13:20.456]  Bill Clinton has done it over and over and over and over.
[03:13:21.116 --> 03:13:22.097]  And they all cover it up.
[03:13:22.117 --> 03:13:23.118]  They cover everything up.
[03:13:23.338 --> 03:13:23.998]  They cover it all up.
[03:13:24.018 --> 03:13:26.820]  And they've been covering up for these people since day one.
[03:13:26.840 --> 03:13:29.442]  The mainstream media covers up since day one.
[03:13:29.823 --> 03:13:30.843]  They do anything they want.
[03:13:31.043 --> 03:13:35.887]  I'm going to tell you something that happened to me during, afterwards, when they took me in the back of that room.
[03:13:36.673 --> 03:13:38.775]  At that Carpenters Union.
[03:13:39.636 --> 03:13:42.218]  The Carpenters, you know, were pissed, right?
[03:13:42.578 --> 03:13:45.661]  They had a security detail, you know, and you know what?
[03:13:46.862 --> 03:13:48.603]  They said, you're trespassed.
[03:13:48.903 --> 03:13:51.425]  I got roughed up a little bit, but that's all cool, man.
[03:13:51.445 --> 03:13:52.126]  We're in Vegas.
[03:13:52.146 --> 03:13:53.647]  That's how it works here, right?
[03:13:54.188 --> 03:14:00.393]  But they had that bald guy with the black suit on, that's the one that left me in the video, like, roughing my arm up.
[03:14:01.074 --> 03:14:03.115]  He kept punching into me.
[03:14:04.246 --> 03:14:05.867]  Ripping my arm.
[03:14:05.887 --> 03:14:09.851]  And then it was right out of the Matrix, Alex.
[03:14:10.471 --> 03:14:11.332]  Right out of the Matrix.
[03:14:11.352 --> 03:14:13.474]  And he goes, I'd watch out.
[03:14:14.615 --> 03:14:16.617]  We can do anything to you anytime we want.
[03:14:18.592 --> 03:14:20.034]  Yeah, until we decide to do something to him.
[03:14:20.054 --> 03:14:21.996]  That's what these guys are going to find out.
[03:14:22.116 --> 03:14:22.436]  Wow.
[03:14:22.576 --> 03:14:25.599]  I'll tell you, Richard Garrett, I want to get you up for a full 30 minutes an hour this week.
[03:14:25.960 --> 03:14:26.701]  This is amazing.
[03:14:26.761 --> 03:14:35.530]  I want to play a clip here and then come back when you have a final comment, because I'm going to get the other crew in here in the next 45 minutes before the debate kicks off, and they're going to be on afterwards with analysis.
[03:14:37.432 --> 03:14:42.356]  The Clintons are so maniacal and so evil, I had them kick me off local radio, which is very popular.
[03:14:42.737 --> 03:14:45.059]  I was told to quit talking about the Clintons when I did and I got fired.
[03:14:45.299 --> 03:14:52.065]  Then I got physically beat up and attacked, and then when they're beating me in the face, thugs, they're saying, shut up about the Evans-Clintons or you're dead.
[03:14:52.925 --> 03:15:01.413]  Imagine once they get power again, and like you said, secret service agents, I've had two of them on, FBI agent, Hillary beats him with ashtrays, screams.
[03:15:02.153 --> 03:15:04.956]  I mean, I talked to security detail from the State Department.
[03:15:06.587 --> 03:15:08.808]  Blackwater, about what she would do in Iraq.
[03:15:08.848 --> 03:15:09.768]  It's the same damn crap.
[03:15:10.048 --> 03:15:13.849]  But they said she would get in like an hour-long car ride and go into a trance.
[03:15:14.310 --> 03:15:15.630]  They said it was like she wasn't human.
[03:15:15.890 --> 03:15:18.511]  Then I talked to other contractors, and they said, how do you know that?
[03:15:18.531 --> 03:15:19.371]  I said, well, I was told that.
[03:15:19.671 --> 03:15:22.092]  This woman's not normal, is what I'm saying.
[03:15:22.112 --> 03:15:23.513]  I mean, there's something weird.
[03:15:23.973 --> 03:15:24.693]  And she has to be nice.
[03:15:24.733 --> 03:15:25.633]  She has to be mean.
[03:15:25.653 --> 03:15:27.494]  She's like a group of kids at the White House.
[03:15:27.534 --> 03:15:28.654]  Oh, sweetie, oh, I love you.
[03:15:28.934 --> 03:15:31.976]  And when she closes the door, she goes, blah!
[03:15:32.116 --> 03:15:33.176]  And you're saying you saw that.
[03:15:34.301 --> 03:15:36.122]  It was in the entire convention, man.
[03:15:36.402 --> 03:15:41.424]  I mean, they showed the feed at the United Center on all the TV screens, right?
[03:15:42.185 --> 03:15:44.146]  And she goes, this is Hillary.
[03:15:44.446 --> 03:15:46.587]  I'm outside and I can't wait to see everybody.
[03:15:46.927 --> 03:15:47.988]  I'll be in really soon.
[03:15:48.328 --> 03:15:49.748]  And then she thought the feed was cut.
[03:15:49.768 --> 03:15:53.670]  And she goes, take this effing mic and throw it right at the guy's face.
[03:15:54.030 --> 03:15:56.111]  And the whole crowd just shut up for like 10 minutes.
[03:15:57.332 --> 03:16:02.415]  I've been on air, and they'll say, for no reason, they'll go, don't you ever look me in the eyes, you filth!
[03:16:02.735 --> 03:16:04.096]  You and your family are nothing!
[03:16:04.116 --> 03:16:05.077]  You're nothing like me!
[03:16:05.317 --> 03:16:06.058]  You know who I am!
[03:16:06.078 --> 03:16:09.660]  I have a security detail sweeping her deal for bombs in the green zone.
[03:16:09.900 --> 03:16:10.861]  Man, we've got a sweeping in there.
[03:16:10.881 --> 03:16:11.901]  You pieces of filth!
[03:16:12.642 --> 03:16:14.963]  Get that dog out of here!
[03:16:15.043 --> 03:16:17.345]  I will have you written up and removed!
[03:16:17.725 --> 03:16:22.088]  And she'll scream for an hour, and then they'll apologize, and they'll go, oh sir, it happens all the time.
[03:16:22.688 --> 03:16:24.530]  I mean, she is psycho, man!
[03:16:25.663 --> 03:16:29.168]  Yeah, she's a bipolar maniac bitch.
[03:16:31.452 --> 03:16:32.734]  Well, we're getting you back on, Richard.
[03:16:33.976 --> 03:16:37.141]  Any way for folks to contact you that want to interview you or other media?
[03:16:38.151 --> 03:16:39.252]  Yeah, I'm good to go, man.
[03:16:39.272 --> 03:16:49.300]  You know, I'm going to keep striking all the way through this election cycle here, wearing this shirt, hitting things here when they come to town, getting fundraisers like that.
[03:16:49.500 --> 03:16:50.861]  Well, Richard, great job.
[03:16:50.881 --> 03:16:50.901]  5-5.
[03:16:51.041 --> 03:16:53.903]  I know you didn't do it for the money, but 5 grand is in there to make it exciting.
[03:16:53.943 --> 03:16:54.384]  Great job.
[03:16:54.404 --> 03:16:55.304]  You are the best at this.
[03:16:55.585 --> 03:16:58.327]  We're going to end with you and a clip of this, and I'm going to play a short clip.
[03:16:59.481 --> 03:16:59.541]  I'm
[03:17:18.334 --> 03:17:19.995]  Well, it looks like the ABC version.
[03:17:20.375 --> 03:17:20.936]  Here he is.
[03:17:20.956 --> 03:17:21.936]  This is how it's done.
[03:17:22.216 --> 03:17:23.057]  They want to block this.
[03:17:23.097 --> 03:17:24.698]  They want to have a black ball the media.
[03:17:24.958 --> 03:17:26.019]  They think they control the narrative.
[03:17:26.059 --> 03:17:27.039]  No, we're storming the gates.
[03:17:27.320 --> 03:17:28.200]  An information war.
[03:17:28.220 --> 03:17:30.602]  She wants to send folks screaming racist to attack people.
[03:17:30.642 --> 03:17:31.222]  That's illegal.
[03:17:31.542 --> 03:17:32.263]  We have the WikiLeaks.
[03:17:32.503 --> 03:17:35.745]  What we're doing is peacefully following the law, like Richard Garrett did it.
[03:17:35.925 --> 03:17:36.785]  This guy did it right.
[03:17:38.246 --> 03:17:36.785]  $5,000.
[03:17:38.366 --> 03:17:41.488]  But the real Laurel is exposing these monsters.
[03:17:41.829 --> 03:17:43.390]  I'm the one risking my life, so let's get that straight.
[03:17:43.410 --> 03:17:44.850]  But he was too, with these thugs.
[03:17:44.891 --> 03:17:45.391]  Let's go to it.
[03:17:46.670 --> 03:17:53.919]  ...conditioning for a race four years from now, and the word out of Trump Tower in New York is... Bill Clinton's a rapist!
[03:17:53.939 --> 03:17:55.862]  Bill Clinton's a rapist!
[03:17:55.882 --> 03:18:01.609]  The Donald was not too happy about the fact that it's him, right?
[03:18:15.798 --> 03:18:35.547]  Donald Trump after the debate went into a full scale meltdown attacking women for their weight.
[03:18:35.667 --> 03:18:39.789]  And then his own running mate stands on the stage and won't defend him.
[03:18:42.947 --> 03:18:48.210]  He's going into this debate with Hillary Sunday in a pretty, pretty tough spot.
[03:18:48.470 --> 03:18:50.011]  In a pretty tough spot.
[03:18:50.231 --> 03:18:59.577]  And then that last debate, the closing debate... Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[03:18:59.777 --> 03:19:02.979]  Americanism... I've been telling people about Trump that he's allergic!
[03:19:04.620 --> 03:19:07.641]  Nobody can dispute the fact... That you're a rapist!
[03:19:07.701 --> 03:19:08.722]  That's a free deal!
[03:19:08.742 --> 03:19:10.403]  Bill Clinton's a rapist!
[03:19:22.395 --> 03:19:28.306]  I'm too happy about what I just said.
[03:19:37.717 --> 03:19:42.618]  Now another shirt that was designed and licensed from Roger Stone is the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[03:19:43.279 --> 03:19:45.939]  Looks like the, you know, communist style Obama Hope shirt.
[03:19:46.660 --> 03:19:52.641]  But says, rape, wear it, get aggressive, start the conversations, get on TV with it.
[03:19:52.661 --> 03:19:53.702]  In fact, I'm going to say this right now.
[03:19:54.102 --> 03:20:03.325]  Anyone that gets on national TV with a shirt, clearly, for more than five seconds, gets $1,000.
[03:20:05.919 --> 03:20:07.520]  That means, you know, behind cameras, you name it.
[03:20:07.660 --> 03:20:17.567]  Anyone that gets it on air on national TV and gets the words out, Bill Clinton is a rapist, are things along that line with a bullhorn.
[03:20:17.607 --> 03:20:18.428]  I could go to this right now.
[03:20:18.448 --> 03:20:18.428]  $5,000.
[03:20:18.468 --> 03:20:19.949]  Until a budget of $100,000 has been spent.
[03:20:32.936 --> 03:20:34.377]  Adoptable dogs.
[03:20:34.497 --> 03:20:41.041]  Every year, the Best Friends Animal Society helps cats and dogs who are stuck in animal shelters find homes.
[03:20:41.141 --> 03:20:43.302]  Bill Clinton's a rapist!
[03:20:43.842 --> 03:20:45.623]  Bill Clinton's a rapist!
[03:20:45.884 --> 03:20:51.507]  I think one of the kind of the things that we really need to be looking at in this debate is that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:20:51.647 --> 03:20:52.607]  Infowars.com.
[03:20:52.707 --> 03:20:53.528]  Infowars.com.
[03:20:53.808 --> 03:20:54.689]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[03:20:55.029 --> 03:20:56.069]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:20:56.290 --> 03:20:56.510]  Alright.
[03:20:57.431 --> 03:21:04.108]  I got this Hillary for Prison t-shirt and I just want everyone to know about this like big presidential campaign that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:21:04.289 --> 03:21:04.991]  Infowars.com
[03:21:05.974 --> 03:21:07.735]  Okay, thank you very much, Terrence.
[03:21:07.795 --> 03:21:12.578]  How can we make sure everybody gets a chance to participate?
[03:21:12.618 --> 03:21:23.844]  How can we help families succeed in the most important job of any society, raising children and succeeding at work?
[03:21:23.944 --> 03:21:24.944]  He doesn't age.
[03:21:24.984 --> 03:21:25.865]  No, he doesn't.
[03:21:25.885 --> 03:21:26.385]  He looks great.
[03:21:26.405 --> 03:21:27.586]  We're all going to Rick Roll.
[03:21:27.686 --> 03:21:28.146]  Exactly.
[03:21:29.027 --> 03:21:30.547]  We've had a $100,000 contest before.
[03:21:30.868 --> 03:21:31.528]  My budget's $100,000.
[03:21:32.148 --> 03:21:35.150]  That means if a bunch of people do this, I'll pay up to $100,000 and stop it.
[03:21:37.211 --> 03:21:41.640]  That's $1,000 if you just get the shirt on national TV.
[03:21:43.383 --> 03:21:44.465]  Visually rape.
[03:21:47.066 --> 03:21:49.107]  It is.
[03:21:50.027 --> 03:21:50.988]  It is.
[03:21:51.008 --> 03:21:52.168]  $5,000 if you get the audio.
[03:21:52.188 --> 03:21:52.869]  Legally lawful.
[03:21:52.889 --> 03:22:02.213]  They gotta be outdoors, mother of little bitch, you gotta have a bullhorn, you gotta have the shirt on, have somebody with it, or maybe a big sign with it on it, and two of you hold it up, and then somebody else bullhorns.
[03:22:02.613 --> 03:22:05.774]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, not a philanderer.
[03:22:06.354 --> 03:22:07.795]  Hillary covers up the rape.
[03:22:12.711 --> 03:22:15.412]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[03:22:15.612 --> 03:22:18.673]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[03:22:18.693 --> 03:22:19.754]  Because it's already here.
[03:22:20.134 --> 03:22:20.794]  It's being announced.
[03:22:21.154 --> 03:22:24.615]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[03:22:25.036 --> 03:22:26.996]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:22:27.096 --> 03:22:28.657]  A new battleship in the fight.
[03:22:28.837 --> 03:22:29.837]  InfoWars Live.
[03:22:30.017 --> 03:22:30.878]  Available right now.
[03:22:31.118 --> 03:22:32.458]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[03:22:32.919 --> 03:22:35.319]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:36.920]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[03:22:37.480 --> 03:22:40.481]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[03:22:40.982 --> 03:22:41.562]  Take action!
[03:22:43.375 --> 03:22:47.519]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[03:22:52.847 --> 03:22:54.309]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:22:54.389 --> 03:22:55.810]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo.
[03:22:55.830 --> 03:22:59.314]  We're only about 40 minutes or so away from the beginning of the debate.
[03:22:59.334 --> 03:23:01.997]  We're going to have some phone interviews coming up.
[03:23:02.498 --> 03:23:13.190]  But before we do that, Leanne, your comments on what you saw Donald Trump doing had an amazing move to have a press conference with the victims of Bill Clinton, the rape victims of Bill Clinton.
[03:23:13.910 --> 03:23:16.131]  Had a press conference with them before the debate.
[03:23:16.151 --> 03:23:21.592]  I mean, this is a guy He's not resting for five or six days before he comes out swinging with that.
[03:23:21.612 --> 03:23:36.075]  I think it's gonna be an interesting debate Well, you know Hillary Clinton has her minions in the press that can go and release things at opportune times They do all the work for her while she's off napping for a few days in the background Sitting there smugly just waiting to you know prep for this debate.
[03:23:36.475 --> 03:23:39.496]  So Donald Trump goes and fires the first shot and has a
[03:23:40.196 --> 03:23:40.617]  Well, I think
[03:23:54.511 --> 03:24:05.737]  This was really genius because this is going to force the mainstream media to have to cover these women that continually tries to be swept under the rug like the woman who was one of Hillary Clinton's first cases there.
[03:24:06.938 --> 03:24:14.542]  Kathy Shelton, she was raped as a 12-year-old and Hillary Clinton was representing her accuser, her rapist.
[03:24:15.062 --> 03:24:18.464]  Clinton knew he was guilty and laughed about it.
[03:24:19.685 --> 03:24:21.007]  Laughed about it years later.
[03:24:21.107 --> 03:24:27.076]  Laughed about it years later that ruined her trust in lie detector tests from there on out.
[03:24:27.216 --> 03:24:32.904]  I mean, this is, and so this is like setting the precedent for who she is decades on now.
[03:24:33.204 --> 03:24:35.428]  What she's willing to do anything, anything.
[03:24:35.848 --> 03:24:48.814]  Well, her very first case, as you point out, she gets a rapist of a child off on a technicality and she has been throwing women under the bus for her husband Bill Clinton's political career and for her political career ever since.
[03:24:48.854 --> 03:24:52.735]  That's been her method of operation and I think that's the most interesting thing about it.
[03:24:53.156 --> 03:24:58.358]  Here we're having all of these revelations that are coming out of the 11th hour, as Alex was pointing out earlier.
[03:24:58.838 --> 03:25:04.803]  There's a book that they've been working on for the last year or so that'd be time to come out right now before just before the election.
[03:25:04.823 --> 03:25:06.044]  So it can't be vetted.
[03:25:06.104 --> 03:25:06.944]  It can't be disputed.
[03:25:06.984 --> 03:25:09.506]  We see this type of dirty trick done all the time.
[03:25:09.526 --> 03:25:15.491]  I remember when John McCain was running for president and in South Carolina they came out and they said the day before the election
[03:25:16.374 --> 03:25:20.279]  He's got an illegitimate black child to try to hurt him with Republican voters there.
[03:25:20.760 --> 03:25:29.932]  Well, he had adopted a child from India or something like that that was dark-skinned or whatever, but that's the way these crooks win elections.
[03:25:30.052 --> 03:25:32.055]  They throw this stuff out there at the last minute.
[03:25:32.515 --> 03:25:45.004]  They try to create an equivalency there between their crimes, they know what they've done, and so they create and invent stuff for Donald Trump, real or imagined, and throw this stuff out here at the last minute so people can't really see what's going on.
[03:25:45.044 --> 03:25:47.106]  This is all being done for the low-information voters.
[03:25:47.246 --> 03:25:48.867]  People don't really know what's going on.
[03:25:49.207 --> 03:25:52.330]  And I want to talk about the real revelations that I think were important.
[03:25:52.870 --> 03:25:57.614]  That they used this tape from one of the Bush family.
[03:25:57.714 --> 03:26:03.299]  And let's understand, Billy Bush is the cousin of George W. He's the nephew of George H.W.
[03:26:03.339 --> 03:26:03.540]  Bush.
[03:26:03.780 --> 03:26:07.283]  This is the Bushes and Clintons up to their usual dirty political tricks.
[03:26:07.643 --> 03:26:13.769]  And so they put this out there, completely take off the table the comments that Hillary Clinton had been making.
[03:26:13.809 --> 03:26:15.190]  Some amazing admissions.
[03:26:15.230 --> 03:26:32.140]  What I think is really key to point out here too is that the people who are actually in possession of these tapes got scooped on this because they, NBC and the other Access Hollywood show, they got scooped on it because they were holding on to these tapes waiting for the opportune moment but they got leaked somehow.
[03:26:32.641 --> 03:26:38.124]  Because they needed a cover to cover for these Podesta tape, Podesta emails and that's the key thing.
[03:26:38.144 --> 03:26:42.947]  And then of course we have the usual suspects at the top of the GOP.
[03:26:44.068 --> 03:26:49.232]  People like McCain and all the rest of them who said, well that's it, I'm not endorsing Donald Trump.
[03:26:49.252 --> 03:26:52.295]  It's like, I don't ever remember you ever endorsing Donald Trump.
[03:26:52.555 --> 03:27:01.702]  And every time there is something coming out that the mainstream media wants to build into a crescendo, they have all the usual suspects in the GOP come out and dump on Trump.
[03:27:01.862 --> 03:27:03.744]  Even somebody like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[03:27:04.284 --> 03:27:04.805]  We're good to go.
[03:27:19.608 --> 03:27:20.269]  We're good to go.
[03:27:38.075 --> 03:27:42.016]  From saying earlier in the campaign, I don't need forgiveness for anything.
[03:27:42.056 --> 03:27:42.916]  Remember when he said that?
[03:27:43.136 --> 03:27:46.416]  And I said, oh, that's really painful to hear that he hasn't come to that position.
[03:27:46.877 --> 03:27:50.597]  And hopefully, hopefully, he has grown as a person throughout this campaign.
[03:27:51.137 --> 03:27:56.718]  And one of the things she said is, Mr. Trump apologizes, but she said, you know, America should apologize too.
[03:27:57.478 --> 03:28:06.620]  And when I look at the hypocrisy from Hollywood, talking about the comments that he made, and the fact that he tried to commit adultery, okay?
[03:28:07.836 --> 03:28:11.520]  This is Hollywood that sells us stuff to us on a regular basis.
[03:28:11.560 --> 03:28:12.841]  This is the essence of what they do.
[03:28:12.941 --> 03:28:17.566]  Everything that comes out of Hollywood is either filthy talk, adultery, or gun violence.
[03:28:18.006 --> 03:28:26.935]  They want to ban guns, okay, and they want to make a big deal out of Donald Trump's comments, which I think should be made a big deal out of, but not in the context of these people.
[03:28:27.275 --> 03:28:32.500]  Hollywood and these news websites, you go to these news websites, and all over the news websites is softcore porn or hard
[03:28:32.500 --> 03:28:34.341]  Hardcore porn, you know, Daily Mail or whatever.
[03:28:34.641 --> 03:28:36.421]  These are the people who are wringing their hands?
[03:28:36.782 --> 03:28:37.782]  What hypocrisy!
[03:28:37.982 --> 03:28:38.122]  Right.
[03:28:38.302 --> 03:28:40.583]  This is the filth that America has become.
[03:28:40.923 --> 03:28:48.406]  And the very people who sell this to us, the Hollywood people, the mainstream media, they're the ones that are just, tsk, tsk, all this stuff.
[03:28:48.446 --> 03:28:49.386]  Oh, it's horrific!
[03:28:49.766 --> 03:28:52.427]  This is nothing compared to what they do on a regular basis.
[03:28:52.447 --> 03:28:54.108]  This is how these people earn their money.
[03:28:54.588 --> 03:29:00.050]  And yet they're trying to sell to us the idea that what Donald Trump said in this comment was so bad.
[03:29:00.990 --> 03:29:02.450]  That he needs to be taken off of the ticket.
[03:29:02.530 --> 03:29:07.972]  I have never in my life ever heard anybody on either party say that somebody ought to be removed from a ticket.
[03:29:08.352 --> 03:29:08.552]  Never.
[03:29:08.692 --> 03:29:08.852]  Ever.
[03:29:09.593 --> 03:29:12.574]  Even somebody who's been guilty of facilitating rape like Hillary Clinton.
[03:29:12.614 --> 03:29:15.735]  Nobody other than some of the victims of Hillary Clinton have called for her to be removed.
[03:29:15.755 --> 03:29:18.275]  Even Bill Clinton ran for president a second time.
[03:29:18.435 --> 03:29:18.936]  Exactly.
[03:29:19.116 --> 03:29:19.476]  Exactly.
[03:29:19.496 --> 03:29:23.857]  Because they made that about consensual sex and not about the rape when they did that.
[03:29:23.897 --> 03:29:26.418]  That's why they focused on Monica Lewinsky so much.
[03:29:26.994 --> 03:29:31.516]  And she finishes, Alveda King finishes, by saying, okay, Mr. Trump has caught in the act of his past.
[03:29:31.876 --> 03:29:34.817]  So, quote unquote, yes, he's on the hot spot.
[03:29:34.877 --> 03:29:38.878]  God and the world are watching him, yet we all have sinned and fall short of God's glory.
[03:29:39.338 --> 03:29:40.818]  Not one of us is perfect.
[03:29:41.259 --> 03:29:42.719]  America needs to change.
[03:29:42.739 --> 03:29:43.279]  And you know what?
[03:29:43.399 --> 03:29:45.040]  If America doesn't recover from this,
[03:29:45.680 --> 03:29:47.563]  Filthy state that we're in.
[03:29:47.643 --> 03:29:51.068]  It's been sold to us by the very critics of Donald Trump.
[03:29:51.108 --> 03:29:55.474]  If we don't recover from that, we will get Hillary Clinton as an act of judgment from God.
[03:29:55.514 --> 03:29:57.597]  Now let's take a look at some of these things.
[03:29:57.637 --> 03:29:59.460]  I want to get your comments on some of these, Leanne.
[03:30:00.181 --> 03:30:01.643]  Some of the emails that came out, okay?
[03:30:02.443 --> 03:30:07.185]  Hillary Clinton talking about how there's a bias against people who have led successful or complicated lives.
[03:30:07.245 --> 03:30:07.925]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:30:07.985 --> 03:30:08.165]  Yeah.
[03:30:08.225 --> 03:30:10.166]  That's why she wants to go after Donald Trump's emails.
[03:30:10.586 --> 03:30:10.746]  Right.
[03:30:10.826 --> 03:30:12.107]  He's led a successful life.
[03:30:12.607 --> 03:30:17.209]  That means that his tax returns are complicated because he's got more businesses and she's got aliases, okay?
[03:30:17.769 --> 03:30:22.154]  So, you know, this is why she wants to get him on the carpet.
[03:30:22.194 --> 03:30:25.358]  But she says this to the people, to the bankers that she's talking to.
[03:30:25.398 --> 03:30:29.482]  And these are speeches where she's getting a quarter of a million dollars, made about $22 million.
[03:30:29.843 --> 03:30:31.485]  So she says to them a couple of things like that.
[03:30:31.525 --> 03:30:32.666]  Well, you know, we have to do this.
[03:30:33.127 --> 03:30:37.491]  And I think implied in this, the way I read this, it was kind of an implicit threat to them.
[03:30:38.172 --> 03:30:39.594]  None of you want to get involved in this.
[03:30:39.674 --> 03:30:46.544]  Leave this to the people like Bill and I, who have no conscience, who can lie without any remorse or being caught.
[03:30:47.144 --> 03:30:48.126]  We can do the dirty work.
[03:30:48.146 --> 03:30:50.649]  You just need to pay us and we'll get done for what you need done.
[03:30:50.689 --> 03:30:55.776]  But I think it is clear that she understands precisely what is going on and going after these tax returns.
[03:30:55.876 --> 03:31:08.723]  Right, which is so incredible because Hillary Clinton herself has these questionable, complicated tax returns, but she's known just from being in the public eye for so many decades that she has to keep her squeaky clean.
[03:31:08.843 --> 03:31:12.705]  It's just her Clinton Foundation where, you know, it gets a little tricky there.
[03:31:13.365 --> 03:31:14.926]  But she knows how to play the game.
[03:31:14.946 --> 03:31:17.888]  She's been doing this for decades, but it's so funny how they'll shine the light
[03:31:18.428 --> 03:31:27.320]  And just try to pull Trump out as if he's this terrible billionaire for taking advantage of these tax loopholes when she's taking the same exact loopholes.
[03:31:27.360 --> 03:31:31.206]  When she says you've got to have a private policy and a public policy.
[03:31:31.246 --> 03:31:32.568]  In other words, I got two different things.
[03:31:32.628 --> 03:31:33.309]  I got one thing that...
[03:31:33.709 --> 03:31:39.073]  When you and I, the bankers, are meeting behind closed doors, I'll tell you one thing, but I'm going to tell the public what they want to hear.
[03:31:39.093 --> 03:31:48.181]  I'm going to be for the TPP, I'm going to be for Keystone Pipeline, but I'll tell the public that I'm not for those things, and that's precisely what they're doing with the tax returns, as you mentioned, Leanne.
[03:31:48.681 --> 03:31:52.705]  She has a set of squeaky clean tax returns that she puts out there for display.
[03:31:53.345 --> 03:31:59.951]  Whereas behind the scenes, privately, she's got this massive money laundering thing that's going on with the Clinton Foundation and everything else.
[03:32:00.191 --> 03:32:12.301]  This is incredible criminal enterprise that is completely off the records while she has this squeaky clean little tax return that's very simple, shows the surf that she pays taxes just like they do, okay?
[03:32:12.602 --> 03:32:14.263]  And that's her public face.
[03:32:14.443 --> 03:32:14.643]  Right.
[03:32:14.803 --> 03:32:26.530]  And we also know with these WikiLeaks, these leaked emails that she has admitted, you know, she's out of touch with the middle class lifestyle, you know, the struggle that your ordinary American has to go through.
[03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:35.135]  But yet she's putting herself out there on the campaign trail as this girl who just grew up meager means and her and her husband were dead broke.
[03:32:35.775 --> 03:32:53.307]  She's got hot sauce in her bag, swag, like she's just like you and I. But meanwhile, behind closed doors, to her cronies there, she's saying, hey, wink wink guys, I'm gonna have to tell them this, but when I say this, you know I really mean, I'm gonna allow you all to regulate yourselves.
[03:32:53.728 --> 03:32:54.408]  That's the phoniness of it.
[03:32:55.798 --> 03:33:03.465]  And when she's talking about people who have successful and complicated lives, okay, she goes back to her Cattle Futures episode.
[03:33:04.006 --> 03:33:07.369]  Many of you may not remember Hillary Clinton's Cattle Futures episode.
[03:33:07.389 --> 03:33:10.512]  She's one of the most successful investors ever.
[03:33:11.630 --> 03:33:18.293]  And to go back to the sting yet again, because we talked about it last week with the little nose symbols and everything where she's flicking her nose and stuff.
[03:33:18.813 --> 03:33:20.714]  We go back to what she was doing with the Cattle Futures.
[03:33:20.774 --> 03:33:27.657]  It's essentially, if you've seen the movie The Sting, you know these guys set up a scam where they've got a room and they've got a delay on the broadcast.
[03:33:27.677 --> 03:33:29.058]  So they already know who's won.
[03:33:29.838 --> 03:33:33.160]  And they run this thing to make it sound like it's going concurrently.
[03:33:33.601 --> 03:33:37.303]  And they take the bets from this other guy and make it sound like it's going to go a different way.
[03:33:37.524 --> 03:33:40.386]  They've already covered their bets knowing who's won because they do a delay.
[03:33:40.726 --> 03:33:43.228]  That's what Hillary Clinton did with the cattle futures.
[03:33:43.888 --> 03:33:50.613]  She and her buddies altered the trades, held the trades, made sure that Hillary's trades were put in at a certain time so she would win.
[03:33:51.173 --> 03:33:54.715]  And did that by causing other people to lose, just out of the timing.
[03:33:54.935 --> 03:33:58.876]  So she ran a classic sting, just like the movie, The Sting, okay?
[03:33:59.136 --> 03:33:59.837]  But here's what she said.
[03:33:59.857 --> 03:34:12.182]  She goes to a bunch of people, a group that is working with futures markets, and she says, now it's always a little bit risky for me to come speak to a group that's committed to the futures market, because there's a few knowing laughs, they said.
[03:34:12.322 --> 03:34:15.443]  Many years ago, I actually traded in the futures market.
[03:34:15.863 --> 03:34:18.924]  I worked with a group of like-minded friends and associates.
[03:34:18.985 --> 03:34:19.985]  That's the way she makes her money.
[03:34:20.185 --> 03:34:20.525]  Wow.
[03:34:20.565 --> 03:34:23.048]  Who traded in pork bellies and cotton and other such things.
[03:34:23.168 --> 03:34:24.189]  And I did pretty well.
[03:34:24.209 --> 03:34:29.375]  I invested about $1,000, traded up to about $100,000, and she did it with just a couple of trades and then got out.
[03:34:29.875 --> 03:34:34.600]  That's the way they launder money in the Clintons' foundations, okay?
[03:34:34.901 --> 03:34:36.723]  And that was early days.
[03:34:36.763 --> 03:34:39.866]  That was when she just took $1,000 and they paid her off at like $100,000.
[03:34:41.087 --> 03:34:46.050]  Now she launders money by giving speeches to banks, by having the Clinton Foundation, that sort of thing.
[03:34:46.090 --> 03:34:53.353]  So she's got much more sophisticated, much wealthier because they've taken this to the next level.
[03:34:53.373 --> 03:34:55.154]  But that's precisely what she's doing.
[03:34:55.674 --> 03:34:56.575]  That's the way she makes her money.
[03:34:56.835 --> 03:35:22.849]  And it's so incredible to see just the massive amount of people that she has working for her in every single capacity, trying to streamline her scandals, her speeches, just the amount of people that went through and flagged her speeches because, you know, this started, The Intercept was actually one of the first that posed this question, hey, release your speeches that you made to Goldman Sachs and others, and she kind of laughed it off at first and then she could see the heat was, she said,
[03:35:23.269 --> 03:35:25.350]  Oh yes, well maybe I'll get to that.
[03:35:25.410 --> 03:35:26.451]  We'll see where it is, I don't know.
[03:35:26.791 --> 03:35:35.434]  But while she's saying that to the public, she has all of her people looking, combing through all those speeches, flagging anything that's going to look bad on her behalf.
[03:35:35.835 --> 03:35:38.556]  And so, I mean, think of how many people she has on the staff.
[03:35:38.956 --> 03:35:43.560]  Just wiping up behind her, sweeping up, trying to protect her in every single way.
[03:35:43.600 --> 03:35:51.206]  And then she goes out and laughs on camera and talks about the weather and stuff, because that's how stupid that she thinks most people are.
[03:35:51.306 --> 03:36:05.917]  And frankly, you know, I'm going to think you're really stupid, too, if you allow this tabloid sensationalism to swirl up around the actual issues, to cloud people from the actual issues and from all of the scandals surrounding the Clintons.
[03:36:06.758 --> 03:36:11.864]  Week after week, there's so many scandals that the news moves on so quickly.
[03:36:12.366 --> 03:36:14.587]  Let's talk about a couple of other things that she's got in here.
[03:36:15.088 --> 03:36:25.535]  Here's one, you know, we keep telling you that it's not xenophobic or racist to say that we need to vet the people that are being brought into our country from areas that we have set on fire.
[03:36:25.635 --> 03:36:28.377]  And it's Hillary Clinton who has set these areas on fire.
[03:36:28.837 --> 03:36:41.325]  And she said, and this was back in October of 2013, she said they can't possibly vet all those refugees so they don't know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.
[03:36:41.365 --> 03:36:42.206]  That was Hillary Clinton.
[03:36:42.726 --> 03:36:44.587]  That was Hillary Clinton three years ago.
[03:36:44.607 --> 03:36:50.650]  Today, if someone were to say that, they are despicable racists and xenophobes for saying that.
[03:36:50.770 --> 03:36:55.852]  One other thing that she says here, of course, and this is what we've been talking about, this is the essence of the election.
[03:36:55.912 --> 03:36:58.433]  We say it's about Americanism versus globalism.
[03:36:58.773 --> 03:37:02.295]  Here's the vision of globalism, which is Hillary Clinton's dream.
[03:37:02.715 --> 03:37:03.976]  She said, my dream
[03:37:04.776 --> 03:37:06.577]  is a hemispheric common market.
[03:37:06.657 --> 03:37:07.957]  That's the North American Union, folks.
[03:37:08.457 --> 03:37:14.138]  With open trade, open borders, and sometime in the future with energy that's as green and sustainable as we can get it.
[03:37:14.158 --> 03:37:16.939]  In other words, crony capitalism.
[03:37:17.259 --> 03:37:31.603]  Shutting down everything, shutting down coal, shutting down all domestic production of oil, shutting down all internal combustion engines, confining people to the cities, and turning all of our transportation, all of our energy production, over to a few politically connected people.
[03:37:31.923 --> 03:37:38.644]  Okay, that's Agenda 21, that's the UN Agenda for Sustainable Development she's talking about, and she's talking about the North American Union.
[03:37:38.904 --> 03:37:44.045]  Destroying our borders, opening trade, and turning it into a hemispheric open market.
[03:37:44.285 --> 03:37:45.886]  That is going to be controlled by who?
[03:37:45.906 --> 03:37:48.686]  Is it going to be controlled by our elected representatives?
[03:37:48.746 --> 03:37:48.886]  No.
[03:37:49.166 --> 03:37:56.788]  We're not going to have a say in that market as to who gets to participate, who gets to play, which businesses and industries are going to be allowed to compete in that market.
[03:37:56.848 --> 03:37:58.608]  That's going to be something, as we've seen now,
[03:37:59.189 --> 03:38:02.787]  With the Trans-Pacific and the Trans-Atlantic partnership agreements.
[03:38:03.786 --> 03:38:10.671]  The economies are going to be managed by these corporate conglomerates.
[03:38:10.691 --> 03:38:12.673]  The same types of people that wrote these deals.
[03:38:12.733 --> 03:38:15.675]  It's going to be a small committee and it's going to be a living document.
[03:38:15.735 --> 03:38:18.057]  They can add China if they want to to the document.
[03:38:18.077 --> 03:38:21.740]  This isn't a bulwark against China coming after our country.
[03:38:21.780 --> 03:38:23.001]  They can add anyone they want to.
[03:38:23.041 --> 03:38:24.202]  They can change any terms.
[03:38:24.502 --> 03:38:28.645]  They can destroy any industry or they can lift somebody up.
[03:38:28.705 --> 03:38:30.787]  They can give a monopoly to anyone that they choose.
[03:38:30.967 --> 03:38:32.168]  That is what we're looking at.
[03:38:32.508 --> 03:38:33.529]  That is her dream.
[03:38:33.829 --> 03:38:34.029]  Right.
[03:38:34.590 --> 03:38:41.618]  And that's what she says, of course, in her private positions, not her public positions, that she tells people now she's against the TPP.
[03:38:42.078 --> 03:38:47.605]  You know, she wants to talk about borders, you know, after she lets in hundreds of thousands unvetted.
[03:38:48.746 --> 03:38:49.707]  But it's interesting, too.
[03:38:49.987 --> 03:38:57.994]  Jake Tapper actually confronted Tim Kaine about these emails, and he immediately comes out and says, well, you know, there's thousands of them.
[03:38:58.034 --> 03:38:59.395]  I can't, we can't be sure.
[03:38:59.475 --> 03:39:00.435]  The Russians could have changed.
[03:39:00.456 --> 03:39:01.677]  We shouldn't trust WikiLeaks.
[03:39:02.057 --> 03:39:04.899]  Meanwhile, WikiLeaks used to be kind of the darling of the left.
[03:39:04.959 --> 03:39:09.163]  They were really all for WikiLeaks when they were exposing the type of information that they wanted.
[03:39:09.543 --> 03:39:13.866]  But now that they're going against the Democrats and Clinton, now all of a sudden he's a Russian agent.
[03:39:14.247 --> 03:39:15.308]  He's this terrible guy.
[03:39:15.848 --> 03:39:18.070]  We're going to have to go toe-to-toe with those Rooskies.
[03:39:18.151 --> 03:39:22.335]  It's going to be nuclear combat toe-to-toe with the Rooskies if they get their way, and it will be.
[03:39:22.856 --> 03:39:29.703]  And he was asking, you know, well, did she say this to the Brazilian bank in 2013 that she was for open trade and open borders?
[03:39:29.763 --> 03:39:31.125]  And he's like, well, you could just ask her.
[03:39:33.948 --> 03:39:34.889]  Yeah, that's the whole thing.
[03:39:35.329 --> 03:39:36.851]  It is simply muddying the water.
[03:39:36.991 --> 03:39:38.533]  It is simply a smokescreen.
[03:39:38.973 --> 03:39:42.596]  They want to come out and say, it's the Russians, or they could make this stuff up.
[03:39:42.677 --> 03:39:44.618]  Who knows if they made this stuff up?
[03:39:44.678 --> 03:39:45.619]  Just trying to muddy the water.
[03:39:45.920 --> 03:39:52.446]  They won't definitively come out and respond to any of these very specific allegations, these very specific quotes that are out there.
[03:39:52.726 --> 03:39:53.907]  They won't respond to any of it.
[03:39:54.248 --> 03:39:55.869]  They just say, well, you know, it could be made up.
[03:39:55.969 --> 03:39:57.211]  Well, it could be, but it isn't.
[03:39:57.811 --> 03:40:00.434]  If it were, you would come out and confront that.
[03:40:00.514 --> 03:40:01.115]  Here's another one.
[03:40:01.295 --> 03:40:04.819]  They want to talk about how technology and how these leaks have come out.
[03:40:05.380 --> 03:40:09.985]  Clinton said when she got to the State Department, most people were not permitted to have handheld devices.
[03:40:10.205 --> 03:40:14.711]  Well, there's a reason for that, Hillary, and you just demonstrated for us why there's a reason for that.
[03:40:15.471 --> 03:40:16.452]  We've got Owen on the line.
[03:40:16.472 --> 03:40:17.853]  We're going to go to Owen here in just one moment.
[03:40:17.873 --> 03:40:22.477]  Real quickly, though, I want to say, when I got there, she said they were mostly not permitted to have handheld devices.
[03:40:22.537 --> 03:40:28.141]  I mean, so you're thinking, how do we operate in this new environment dominated by technology and globalizing forces?
[03:40:28.641 --> 03:40:32.084]  Well, one thing you don't do is violate all security protocols.
[03:40:32.344 --> 03:40:34.105]  One thing you don't do is commit felonies.
[03:40:34.586 --> 03:40:36.868]  And they have been hoisted by their own petard.
[03:40:37.108 --> 03:40:43.813]  They thought they would set up these private servers and these multiple handheld devices, and they would be able to conduct their business on the sly.
[03:40:44.313 --> 03:40:47.717]  And instead now, what they're reaping is what they sowed, okay?
[03:40:47.757 --> 03:40:52.542]  Because they had absolutely no security, because not only are they criminals, they're also stupid.
[03:40:53.082 --> 03:41:00.310]  And so, because of their foolishness, they've exposed themselves as well as the rest of the nation to this kind of exposure.
[03:41:00.410 --> 03:41:06.817]  And now that they're reaping this, they want to pretend, well, it's the Russians, and so we need to be able to go to war with them if they do any more cyber-hacking again.
[03:41:07.017 --> 03:41:16.559]  Let's not forget, she knew exactly what she was doing, because we know from that leaked footage that came, she was having dinner with Stan Lee, where she was kind of joking off the cuff about, oh, emails.
[03:41:16.599 --> 03:41:18.719]  Have you seen how many times I've been audited?
[03:41:18.779 --> 03:41:22.540]  Can you even imagine if I put that out there in public?
[03:41:22.740 --> 03:41:25.521]  You know, I would never, emails would take me down.
[03:41:25.781 --> 03:41:27.281]  So even back then, she knew.
[03:41:27.581 --> 03:41:30.602]  So she had to set up her own private server, keep everything separate.
[03:41:30.922 --> 03:41:34.443]  We got a clip of Cain talking about this with Jake Tapper.
[03:41:34.463 --> 03:41:35.463]  Let's run that clip real quick.
[03:41:36.103 --> 03:41:38.125]  Let's turn to the latest revelations from WikiLeaks.
[03:41:38.185 --> 03:41:46.431]  We finally got a glimpse at excerpts from those famous paid speeches by Hillary Clinton that Bernie Sanders wanted released during the Democratic primaries.
[03:41:46.791 --> 03:41:58.720]  In one of them, in a closed door 2013 speech to a Brazilian bank, Secretary Clinton said this, take a look, quote, my dream is a hemispheric common market with open borders sometime in the future.
[03:41:59.641 --> 03:42:00.421]  Is that her dream?
[03:42:00.501 --> 03:42:01.682]  Is that what she wants?
[03:42:02.463 --> 03:42:03.163]  Open borders?
[03:42:03.283 --> 03:42:03.984]  An open market?
[03:42:06.238 --> 03:42:14.507]  Yeah, Jake, I'm glad you asked it that way because I don't think we can dignify documents dumped by WikiLeaks and just assume that they're all accurate and true.
[03:42:15.068 --> 03:42:20.635]  Anybody who hacks in to get documents is completely capable of manipulating them.
[03:42:21.015 --> 03:42:22.337]  But you asked the question about
[03:42:22.717 --> 03:42:24.319]  What is your position on policy?
[03:42:24.379 --> 03:42:33.087]  Hillary's position on on policy on markets and trade is very plain, which is we'll do trade deals, but only if they meet three criteria.
[03:42:33.127 --> 03:42:35.309]  Do they increase American jobs?
[03:42:35.349 --> 03:42:36.911]  Do they increase American wages?
[03:42:37.751 --> 03:42:39.473]  And are they good for national security?
[03:42:39.493 --> 03:42:43.016]  And if they are and if we can enforce them, then trade deals are okay.
[03:42:43.056 --> 03:42:43.637]  But if they're not,
[03:42:43.817 --> 03:42:44.738]  We can't embrace them.
[03:42:44.758 --> 03:42:46.279]  And as you know, when Hillary was a U.S.
[03:42:46.299 --> 03:42:52.523]  Senator, she voted for some trade deals when they met her standards, but she voted against others when they didn't.
[03:42:53.224 --> 03:42:58.888]  We're going to fight so that the only trade deals will contemplate are ones that have the high standards that she set out.
[03:43:00.429 --> 03:43:04.392]  Right, but Senator, first of all, are you disputing the accuracy of this?
[03:43:04.432 --> 03:43:08.855]  Did Hillary Clinton not say to these Brazilian bankers that she had this dream?
[03:43:11.235 --> 03:43:18.684]  Jake, I have no way of knowing the accuracy of documents dumped by this hacking organization.
[03:43:19.064 --> 03:43:20.966]  But I think it is really important.
[03:43:21.447 --> 03:43:23.069]  This hacking has been connected.
[03:43:23.930 --> 03:43:26.633]  Much of the hacking has been connected to the Russian government.
[03:43:26.673 --> 03:43:27.614]  But did she say it?
[03:43:27.654 --> 03:43:28.496]  He won't admit.
[03:43:30.558 --> 03:43:39.483]  That this kind of hacking has been traced directly to the Russian government, and there is a direct intent to influence the outcome of an American election.
[03:43:39.863 --> 03:43:40.183]  Oh, by who?
[03:43:40.203 --> 03:43:40.483]  The DNC?
[03:43:40.563 --> 03:43:45.906]  If that is in fact true, you cannot accept as gospel truth everything that they might put in the document.
[03:43:46.247 --> 03:43:49.969]  But you didn't ask about the document, you asked me what Hillary Clinton's position was.
[03:43:51.529 --> 03:43:53.090]  Exactly, so answer the question.
[03:43:53.150 --> 03:43:54.751]  Is this document accurate?
[03:43:54.891 --> 03:43:56.692]  Did she tell Brazilian bankers?
[03:43:57.152 --> 03:43:58.833]  I have no way of knowing that.
[03:43:59.033 --> 03:43:59.814]  I have no way of knowing.
[03:44:00.922 --> 03:44:03.243]  I know nothing.
[03:44:04.743 --> 03:44:06.584]  But the documents are in the thousands.
[03:44:06.644 --> 03:44:07.324]  I haven't asked her.
[03:44:07.344 --> 03:44:08.844]  But you asked me about her position on trade.
[03:44:08.864 --> 03:44:11.205]  Her position on trade is very clear.
[03:44:11.765 --> 03:44:12.726]  Well, maybe you should ask her.
[03:44:12.746 --> 03:44:13.946]  What about her position on borders?
[03:44:13.966 --> 03:44:19.108]  Because her dream in this document, her dream is a hemispheric common market with open borders.
[03:44:19.308 --> 03:44:24.069]  Is that something that in the Clinton-Kaine administration we would see?
[03:44:24.169 --> 03:44:24.729]  Open borders?
[03:44:25.470 --> 03:44:26.030]  And open trade?
[03:44:26.883 --> 03:44:34.284]  We believe in comprehensive immigration reform that would, with the pillars that we've described, where we would have more border security.
[03:44:34.584 --> 03:44:53.568]  Jake, as you know, I voted for significant investments in border security in June of 2013 and continue to believe that's part of a comprehensive immigration reform plan, along with the value of keeping families together and providing a path to citizenship for those who work hard, play by the rules.
[03:44:54.708 --> 03:45:03.053]  And of course, back in 2013, Hillary Clinton said, we don't have any way to know whether jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.
[03:45:03.253 --> 03:45:06.315]  Right, and she also called the TPP the gold standard in trade deals.
[03:45:06.335 --> 03:45:07.455]  Yeah, and nothing has changed.
[03:45:07.616 --> 03:45:10.797]  I mean, Cain himself is for the TPP.
[03:45:10.897 --> 03:45:11.078]  Right.
[03:45:11.098 --> 03:45:14.019]  I want to go to our reporter, Owen Schroyer.
[03:45:14.079 --> 03:45:15.100]  He is in St.
[03:45:15.180 --> 03:45:17.181]  Louis at the site of the debate.
[03:45:17.501 --> 03:45:19.502]  Owen, what's happening in St.
[03:45:19.522 --> 03:45:19.783]  Louis?
[03:45:21.741 --> 03:45:32.531]  Well, we are on the campus of Washington University, and if you don't believe in the liberalization of higher education in this country, this is an illustration.
[03:45:32.651 --> 03:45:33.692]  It is truly unbelievable.
[03:45:34.272 --> 03:45:43.540]  All of these higher education students, I would say, at least from what we've seen out here on the ground, it is probably 80% Hillary Clinton supporters.
[03:45:43.640 --> 03:45:44.121]  Unbelievable.
[03:45:44.501 --> 03:45:53.847]  I'm surprised there's 20% that aren't, because that's the whole point of colleges anymore, is to sell the political correctness, the victimology, everything.
[03:45:54.748 --> 03:45:57.990]  That's why they want to have everybody go to college for another four years.
[03:45:58.030 --> 03:45:58.870]  You're ostracized.
[03:45:58.910 --> 03:45:59.491]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:45:59.531 --> 03:46:00.692]  It's a propaganda machine.
[03:46:01.112 --> 03:46:01.432]  Absolutely.
[03:46:01.452 --> 03:46:02.473]  So I'm surprised there's 20% there that aren't.
[03:46:05.308 --> 03:46:13.874]  Some of us are able to beat the brainwashing, but my guess is all the Trump supporters were probably studying in the library trying to get good grades for their future.
[03:46:14.214 --> 03:46:15.235]  But you know what's amazing?
[03:46:16.375 --> 03:46:21.979]  We've got the CNN set here, right to my right, as our cameraman is putting it on right here.
[03:46:23.984 --> 03:46:24.625]  It's just amazing.
[03:46:24.645 --> 03:46:31.608]  I know you guys have been on air, so you probably haven't heard the debates or the conversations going on on the CNN Roundtable.
[03:46:32.328 --> 03:46:32.988]  My God!
[03:46:33.029 --> 03:46:36.530]  I mean, we are talking about the softest, weakest-minded people.
[03:46:36.650 --> 03:46:39.452]  I can't even imagine the things that they're saying.
[03:46:39.492 --> 03:46:40.152]  Jake Tapper?
[03:46:40.852 --> 03:46:43.394]  Jake Tapper is hosting your debate night?
[03:46:43.834 --> 03:46:45.376]  This guy is, he is terrible!
[03:46:45.396 --> 03:46:49.619]  I mean, honestly, no energy, no way to lead an invigorating conversation.
[03:46:49.859 --> 03:47:01.727]  The whole time they're sitting here talking about the Trump tapes being released, Van Jones even says that now Trump's voice and people who speak like Trump are now the representation of rapists in this country.
[03:47:01.948 --> 03:47:03.769]  Doesn't even mention Bill Clinton!
[03:47:04.129 --> 03:47:05.010]  Doesn't even mention him!
[03:47:05.610 --> 03:47:20.643]  These people who have given Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton a pass for 25 or more years on rape allegations, and multiple rape allegations, now are just absolutely incensed about the comments that Donald Trump made.
[03:47:20.703 --> 03:47:26.788]  And I was saying earlier, Owen, that what we see is the same people in Hollywood, in the media, complaining about this language.
[03:47:26.948 --> 03:47:28.289]  That is how they make their money.
[03:47:28.569 --> 03:47:30.711]  That is how they make their money, selling that to the public.
[03:47:31.768 --> 03:47:44.320]  Yeah, I mean it's just if you tune into any late-night television show, any humor, you know, any movie, you're gonna hear that stuff, and you have no problem paying for that entertainment, but, you know, Donald Trump says something that, you know what, okay, it's inappropriate.
[03:47:45.054 --> 03:47:46.095]  We say inappropriate things.
[03:47:46.115 --> 03:47:50.537]  These people sitting on this set, you're going to tell me that they've never made lewd comments in a private conversation?
[03:47:50.557 --> 03:47:52.197]  And if they haven't, I feel bad for them.
[03:47:52.217 --> 03:47:56.600]  I mean, honestly, I guess that's the brainwashing conversations that liberals have with one another.
[03:47:56.620 --> 03:47:58.921]  There's no excitement or energy or anything.
[03:47:59.141 --> 03:48:00.041]  Don't offend anybody.
[03:48:00.061 --> 03:48:00.661]  Don't offend anybody.
[03:48:00.942 --> 03:48:02.062]  But it's amazing.
[03:48:02.082 --> 03:48:03.343]  We got a ton of videos.
[03:48:03.663 --> 03:48:06.924]  There are a few of them that are on the Alex Jones channel already on YouTube.
[03:48:07.325 --> 03:48:14.268]  If you liked my work, what I've done with other Trump protesters, you're going to love what you see on the Alex Jones YouTube channel tonight.
[03:48:14.748 --> 03:48:15.710]  That's great, that's great.
[03:48:15.730 --> 03:48:17.873]  So what else have you seen there?
[03:48:17.893 --> 03:48:25.204]  You've done some interviews with some of the Clinton protesters there and you've seen CNN talking about how they're going to spend this.
[03:48:25.244 --> 03:48:29.750]  Are they talking at all, Owen, about the Podesta emails that were leaked?
[03:48:31.334 --> 03:48:32.656]  Nothing.
[03:48:32.836 --> 03:48:34.358]  Very limited.
[03:48:35.359 --> 03:48:41.948]  You've got Jeffrey Lord and Kayleigh McEnany are on the stage, so obviously they injected and shed some light onto that situation.
[03:48:42.168 --> 03:48:48.116]  But anytime it got brought up, Van Jones or Jake Tapper would immediately divert and change the topic back.
[03:48:49.302 --> 03:49:04.687]  Yeah, we've been reading some of the places here where Hillary Clinton bragged about how she and some of her like-minded individuals had helped her to make a fortune investing in cattle futures, talking about how... Oh, but it's not on the mainstream news, so it doesn't exist.
[03:49:04.867 --> 03:49:05.527]  That's right, yeah.
[03:49:05.607 --> 03:49:08.469]  Talking about how she's going to do gun control by executive order.
[03:49:08.509 --> 03:49:11.351]  That's one of the key things that she said in these things.
[03:49:11.391 --> 03:49:15.053]  But of course, that's not anything at all that anyone is going to talk about.
[03:49:15.073 --> 03:49:19.315]  All they're going to talk about is Donald Trump saying the types of things that you see
[03:49:20.476 --> 03:49:25.798]  Go out on a daily basis from the television programs, from the movies that we see.
[03:49:25.818 --> 03:49:34.582]  To me, it's like these people like Matt Damien who makes his money doing action films complaining about guns and saying we need to eliminate guns.
[03:49:34.602 --> 03:49:35.803]  It's that type of hypocrisy.
[03:49:36.283 --> 03:49:43.010]  Well, and that's what we've also seen with these leaks is the cozy press relationship that the Clinton campaign has.
[03:49:43.470 --> 03:49:50.978]  And they have, you know, all of these reporters, mainstream reporters that we all know, Wolf Blitzer, Rachel Maddow, Chris Hayes, etc, etc.
[03:49:51.399 --> 03:49:58.326]  They are the friendly press and they're going to these exclusive, off-the-record dinners and to kind of
[03:49:58.886 --> 03:50:12.976]  Be taught how to put Hillary Clinton's message across and, you know, what type of ways that they can protect her and feed Clinton's stories, just in case anything bad comes up about the Clinton Foundation, about her emails.
[03:50:13.276 --> 03:50:15.938]  What are some other stories that you guys could cover instead?
[03:50:15.998 --> 03:50:18.640]  And we're just watching with these leaked emails.
[03:50:18.680 --> 03:50:23.383]  I mean, that's what we've been witnessing the mainstream media doing is protecting her left and right.
[03:50:24.788 --> 03:50:31.533]  Well, and the amazing thing is, even talking to the Clinton supporters that are out here, many of them admit they don't like Hillary.
[03:50:31.573 --> 03:50:37.057]  They admit she's corrupt and they basically just hate Donald Trump so much that they're going to vote for Hillary even though they don't like her.
[03:50:37.477 --> 03:50:38.318]  So I say, well, why not?
[03:50:38.338 --> 03:50:39.399]  You know, there's other candidates.
[03:50:39.419 --> 03:50:40.559]  You can vote for another candidate.
[03:50:40.579 --> 03:50:42.221]  They're like, no, we're just going to go ahead and vote for Hillary.
[03:50:42.441 --> 03:50:43.121]  Oh, but she's corrupt.
[03:50:43.141 --> 03:50:43.602]  She's a liar.
[03:50:43.722 --> 03:50:44.802]  Yeah, we're going to vote for her anyway.
[03:50:45.003 --> 03:50:45.223]  Okay.
[03:50:45.805 --> 03:50:46.265]  Good luck with that.
[03:50:46.625 --> 03:50:53.746]  Well, we're going to take a quick break and we're going to play some of the reports, some of the interviews that you've had with people there at the University of St.
[03:50:53.766 --> 03:50:53.866]  Louis.
[03:50:53.886 --> 03:50:54.607]  Brace yourselves.
[03:50:55.067 --> 03:50:57.947]  And yeah, we're going to be right back with that.
[03:50:58.247 --> 03:51:02.608]  We're going to take a quick break and the debate is coming up in about another 10 minutes.
[03:51:02.648 --> 03:51:06.789]  We're going to have some of Owen's encounters with the politically brainwashed.
[03:51:06.809 --> 03:51:07.349]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:07.389 --> 03:51:11.649]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[03:51:11.669 --> 03:51:14.850]  Americanism, not globalism!
[03:51:22.441 --> 03:51:26.123]  Why are we attacking Trump all of a sudden?
[03:51:26.583 --> 03:51:28.324]  Sexual assault that he admitted to!
[03:51:28.384 --> 03:51:30.285]  He lost a billion dollars in one year!
[03:51:30.305 --> 03:51:31.025]  He's a moron!
[03:51:38.348 --> 03:51:44.932]  Steve Jobs also lost a billion dollars and is world-renowned as one of the most smartest men in the world.
[03:51:44.952 --> 03:51:48.154]  Businessmen lose money.
[03:51:48.294 --> 03:52:01.761]  I think it's funny how Trump protesters want to demonize Donald Trump for being a womanizer when Bill Clinton has settled multiple rape cases.
[03:52:01.781 --> 03:52:02.662]  That's a fact.
[03:52:03.802 --> 03:52:07.623]  So you want a rapist in the White House?
[03:52:07.723 --> 03:52:13.424]  Raise your hand if you want a rapist in the White House.
[03:52:13.684 --> 03:52:15.724]  Raise your hand if you want a rapist in the White House.
[03:52:15.764 --> 03:52:17.685]  Who has Donald Trump raped?
[03:52:17.705 --> 03:52:19.025]  Who has Donald Trump raped?
[03:52:19.065 --> 03:52:19.805]  Name one woman.
[03:52:33.308 --> 03:52:34.670]  Donald Trump is a moron.
[03:52:34.830 --> 03:52:36.613]  Donald Trump's a moron.
[03:52:36.673 --> 03:52:39.938]  This guy's made billions of dollars.
[03:52:40.238 --> 03:52:43.223]  One of the most successful businessmen in the world.
[03:52:51.732 --> 03:52:55.574]  You wouldn't take a million dollar loan from your dad to build a business?
[03:52:55.614 --> 03:52:57.155]  You bet I'd take a million dollars.
[03:52:57.175 --> 03:52:58.136]  14 million!
[03:52:58.156 --> 03:52:59.556]  Let me ask you a question, sir.
[03:52:59.576 --> 03:53:00.777]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:53:00.857 --> 03:53:04.819]  If you got $1 million dollars and turned it... 14!
[03:53:04.959 --> 03:53:04.819]  14!
[03:53:05.019 --> 03:53:05.759]  Okay, fine.
[03:53:05.779 --> 03:53:09.761]  If you got $100 million dollars and turned it into $6 billion, would that be a success?
[03:53:09.901 --> 03:53:10.141]  No!
[03:53:10.201 --> 03:53:11.222]  Because I could do better!
[03:53:11.682 --> 03:53:14.565]  No, that's not a success.
[03:53:14.826 --> 03:53:17.208]  Turning millions into billions is not a success.
[03:53:17.228 --> 03:53:18.690]  This is right out of Austin Powers.
[03:53:18.810 --> 03:53:21.773]  Why make billions when we can make millions?
[03:53:21.853 --> 03:53:23.335]  This is what we're dealing with out here.
[03:53:27.199 --> 03:53:27.700]  I love it.
[03:53:27.740 --> 03:53:28.921]  His daddy bailed him out.
[03:53:31.383 --> 03:53:38.029]  Trump is going to bail out this country from the corrupt politicians that we've been dealing with for decades, folks.
[03:53:38.049 --> 03:53:38.750]  For decades.
[03:53:38.970 --> 03:53:40.632]  These people complain about the government.
[03:53:40.792 --> 03:53:43.695]  They want to put another government shield right back in the White House.
[03:53:44.035 --> 03:53:45.636]  It's really unbelievable, folks.
[03:53:45.736 --> 03:53:47.178]  Owen Schroeder from Infowars.com.
[03:53:47.498 --> 03:53:50.240]  We're going to be out here all night.
[03:54:22.140 --> 03:54:28.103]  Look, I'm not going to sit here and say, see, I told you so, that communist Chinese-style net censorship is coming to the web.
[03:54:28.444 --> 03:54:29.164]  Because it's already here.
[03:54:29.564 --> 03:54:30.225]  It's being announced.
[03:54:30.565 --> 03:54:34.087]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[03:54:34.447 --> 03:54:38.069]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app, a new battleship in the fight.
[03:54:38.249 --> 03:54:40.270]  InfoWars Live, available right now.
[03:54:40.530 --> 03:54:41.811]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[03:54:41.831 --> 03:54:44.692]  Are you going to sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[03:54:44.712 --> 03:54:46.313]  Or are you going to be part of history?
[03:54:46.873 --> 03:54:49.855]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[03:54:50.375 --> 03:54:51.016]  Take action!
[03:54:55.519 --> 03:54:57.880]  We're now about five minutes out from this historic Sunday.
[03:54:57.900 --> 03:55:01.462]  Americanism, not globalism will be our credo!
[03:55:01.602 --> 03:55:04.024]  Americanism, not globalism.
[03:55:04.404 --> 03:55:06.245]  Americanism, not globalism.
[03:55:06.325 --> 03:55:07.646]  Americanism, not globalism.
[03:55:08.286 --> 03:55:09.427]  This is the info.
[03:55:10.888 --> 03:55:15.391]  As I said, we are now only five minutes exactly out.
[03:55:17.148 --> 03:55:18.909]  From this historic debate.
[03:55:19.509 --> 03:55:24.051]  If Trump doesn't attack the hypocrisy and the lies, he's in deep trouble.
[03:55:24.311 --> 03:55:26.071]  He could still come back in the next 29 days.
[03:55:26.792 --> 03:55:28.732]  We're almost 28 days starting at midnight.
[03:55:29.853 --> 03:55:30.673]  In just a few hours.
[03:55:30.733 --> 03:55:34.195]  We're 28 days basically out, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:55:34.395 --> 03:55:34.715]  28 days.
[03:55:36.675 --> 03:55:37.256]  Less than a month.
[03:55:38.636 --> 03:55:42.398]  We have Billy Bush, the nephew of George Herbert Walker Bush.
[03:55:44.959 --> 03:55:45.499]  We have
[03:55:47.432 --> 03:55:54.558]  This recording of Trump with some jocular, heavily edited audio, making jokes about these women loving you so much you can grab on them, 11 years ago.
[03:55:55.579 --> 03:56:15.815]  And you've got the judge that Obama appointed, in the district Hillary Clinton was a senator in, approving today, three Jane Doe's, one of them they say a victim, two of them witnesses, one that didn't see it, of Jerry Epstein and Trump double teaming a little girl 22 years ago,
[03:56:17.250 --> 03:56:23.698]  When the Clintons and Obama covered up for Epstein, he got a slap on the wrist for girls being shipped to Slave Island, reportedly.
[03:56:24.139 --> 03:56:25.741]  Clinton on the plane 20 plus times.
[03:56:25.761 --> 03:56:26.562]  It was 16 times.
[03:56:26.582 --> 03:56:27.423]  Now they're saying 20 times.
[03:56:27.984 --> 03:56:31.769]  Think about the setup and a book they've been writing for a year claiming this.
[03:56:32.690 --> 03:56:34.752]  But the FBI has already given immunity to all the people.
[03:56:35.612 --> 03:56:37.053]  Just like we saw with Hillary's servers.
[03:56:37.834 --> 03:56:38.474]  What do you expect?
[03:56:38.514 --> 03:56:39.194]  You want a dirty trick?
[03:56:39.215 --> 03:56:40.335]  People that overthrow governments?
[03:56:40.736 --> 03:56:41.776]  Oh look, Bill Clinton's on screen.
[03:56:41.816 --> 03:56:42.737]  Let's pump that up for folks.
[03:56:43.137 --> 03:56:43.978]  Oh, how you doing?
[03:56:44.398 --> 03:56:48.321]  Let's show Bill Clinton up front being nice, shaking everybody's hand.
[03:56:48.361 --> 03:56:49.642]  He's so good.
[03:56:49.682 --> 03:56:56.667]  And I heard in the audience tonight there's going to be a young lady, Kathy Shelton, who was 12 years old and got raped and put in a coma.
[03:56:57.847 --> 03:57:01.310]  And that Hillary admittedly knew he was guilty but covered up for him.
[03:57:01.350 --> 03:57:02.871]  And so the little girl wanted it.
[03:57:04.045 --> 03:57:04.906]  So that's all coming up.
[03:57:04.966 --> 03:57:10.871]  This is a referendum on the mainstream media and its lies, on the corporate media, and on everything they do.
[03:57:11.872 --> 03:57:15.455]  This is a referendum on whether we can break their conditioning, whether we can see through their lies.
[03:57:15.855 --> 03:57:18.998]  Turning his mic off a week and a half ago, which was confirmed.
[03:57:19.458 --> 03:57:21.820]  Asking him 40-something questions until Hillary gets six.
[03:57:22.120 --> 03:57:22.681]  Interrupting.
[03:57:22.961 --> 03:57:25.043]  Same thing with his VP, but still, Pence won.
[03:57:26.132 --> 03:57:27.954]  The moderator's up here babbling mindlessly.
[03:57:27.974 --> 03:57:29.276]  We're going live in three minutes here.
[03:57:29.676 --> 03:57:30.577]  We've got multiple feeds.
[03:57:30.597 --> 03:57:32.520]  But Darren McBrain, you're going to be covering this after the show.
[03:57:33.181 --> 03:57:34.282]  An hour and a half of the show.
[03:57:34.702 --> 03:57:35.383]  The P.T.
[03:57:35.423 --> 03:57:36.344]  Barnum disinfo.
[03:57:36.384 --> 03:57:37.406]  The whole system against Trump.
[03:57:37.646 --> 03:57:38.647]  Trump against the globalists.
[03:57:38.667 --> 03:57:39.508]  Trump against the world.
[03:57:39.989 --> 03:57:40.950]  America against the world.
[03:57:40.970 --> 03:57:43.092]  All these foreign governments telling us what to do and who we can have.
[03:57:43.373 --> 03:57:44.174]  McBrain, real fast.
[03:57:45.319 --> 03:57:53.041]  Well, the moderators are getting on the stage right now, and Trump, he found out the hard way that the moderators are not his friend.
[03:57:53.141 --> 03:57:59.663]  And CIA Anderson Cooper... Lester Holt was not his friend, and certainly CIA Anderson Cooper is not going to give him any love tonight.
[03:57:59.723 --> 03:58:03.964]  So, I also think, Alex, we need to look out for operatives in the audience.
[03:58:04.304 --> 03:58:11.146]  This is a town hall style meeting, and we know from, like, just a couple days ago, Hillary had a plant in the audience.
[03:58:11.166 --> 03:58:12.967]  You can expect the same thing tonight.
[03:58:13.852 --> 03:58:14.492]  Absolutely.
[03:58:14.653 --> 03:58:15.653]  All right, great job.
[03:58:15.673 --> 03:58:18.975]  We'll be talking to you more with Lee Ann Mack and David Knight in the live coverage.
[03:58:19.255 --> 03:58:20.216]  I'm going to be a good boy tonight.
[03:58:20.236 --> 03:58:23.898]  I usually get a lot of commentary and analysis, but we're going to sit back and get very, very limited.
[03:58:23.938 --> 03:58:27.740]  We have streams at InfoWars.com of the dry feed from Right Side and others.
[03:58:27.780 --> 03:58:29.701]  Without our commentary, we'll have the limited commentary here.
[03:58:29.721 --> 03:58:33.043]  And then after full analysis in an hour and a half, let's go ahead and go to this feed.
[03:58:33.143 --> 03:58:34.564]  Oh, look, there's Bill Clinton and Chelsea.
[03:58:34.884 --> 03:58:36.065]  Chelsea has some of us all.
[03:58:36.085 --> 03:58:37.806]  She said, Dad, why are you killing all the Haitians?
[03:58:37.846 --> 03:58:38.546]  Why don't you give them money?
[03:58:38.566 --> 03:58:39.807]  Why do you give them watered down drugs?
[03:58:39.827 --> 03:58:40.187]  Why do you still 97%?
[03:58:42.059 --> 03:58:43.460]  But still, she won't stand up against it.
[03:58:43.520 --> 03:58:46.543]  So, they're going live in about a minute and a half.
[03:58:47.184 --> 03:58:50.607]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners of Infowars.com who support the broadcast.
[03:58:51.368 --> 03:58:53.830]  And we have the Bill Clinton rape shirt spreading across the country.
[03:58:53.870 --> 03:58:55.411]  Folks are putting up rape signs outside.
[03:58:55.431 --> 03:58:59.415]  We've had 14 times he's been confronted or they've been confronted with rape on national TV.
[03:58:59.435 --> 03:59:00.476]  They want to blame Trump for this.
[03:59:00.496 --> 03:59:02.137]  They've settled rape cases.
[03:59:02.958 --> 03:59:03.599]  Gloves are off.
[03:59:03.619 --> 03:59:06.582]  You want to hire Black Lives Matter with George Soros to go beat people up?
[03:59:06.882 --> 03:59:08.283]  We're not calling for violence or anything illegal.
[03:59:08.323 --> 03:59:12.107]  We're just showing up with citizens, bringing up the fact that you settled sexual assault cases.
[03:59:12.147 --> 03:59:15.691]  Alright, Anderson Cooper and Mrs. Rat, Raticus, or whatever her name is.
[03:59:16.251 --> 03:59:17.593]  It's going to be three against one.
[03:59:17.733 --> 03:59:19.575]  Trump, the lion, with three hyenas.
[03:59:20.215 --> 03:59:21.577]  I guess a jackal and two hyenas.
[03:59:21.837 --> 03:59:23.138]  Hillary's the jackal, the joker.
[03:59:23.619 --> 03:59:24.499]  Going at them!
[03:59:25.606 --> 03:59:26.886]  All right, so here we go.
[03:59:27.667 --> 03:59:28.067]  45 seconds.
[03:59:28.167 --> 03:59:30.328]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:59:30.348 --> 03:59:31.268]  You'll be part of the InfoWars.
[03:59:31.488 --> 03:59:38.030]  Sending friends and families and neighbors the link to get our live analysis and post-debate analysis at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:59:38.050 --> 03:59:38.871]  We're downloading the free app.
[03:59:39.311 --> 03:59:43.912]  InfoWars.com forward slash app has video feeds, everything to break through the mainstream media.
[03:59:44.192 --> 03:59:45.673]  We have millions of viewers when we do this.
[03:59:45.693 --> 03:59:46.733]  We're bigger than they are now.
[03:59:47.133 --> 03:59:47.834]  They can't stand it.
[03:59:47.854 --> 03:59:49.314]  That's why she wants to shut down the alt media.
[03:59:49.534 --> 03:59:54.156]  Let's go to Central Intelligence Agency officer working for foreign banks, Anderson Cooper.
[03:59:55.176 --> 03:59:56.457]  And his other person.
[03:59:56.477 --> 03:59:58.338]  So this is Hillary, Cooper, and Ratty.
[03:59:59.418 --> 03:59:59.859]  Three of them.
[03:59:59.879 --> 04:00:01.620]  So they're now staying a few more minutes.
[04:00:02.280 --> 04:00:03.180]  They're waiting a few minutes.
[04:00:03.240 --> 04:00:05.902]  I guess they're going to go to it late like they did a week and a half ago.
[04:00:05.922 --> 04:00:07.743]  I wonder if Lester Holt's earpiece is going to go out.
[04:00:07.763 --> 04:00:08.563]  He's not there this week.
[04:00:09.824 --> 04:00:11.164]  So here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:00:11.205 --> 04:00:14.346]  We are counting down right now to the debate.
[04:00:14.526 --> 04:00:16.487]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[04:00:17.688 --> 04:00:21.850]  Let's just go ahead and write down, fade up the audio and get some of the background noise here for radio listeners.
[04:00:21.870 --> 04:00:23.331]  A lot of affiliates are tuning into this.
[04:00:25.186 --> 04:00:30.153]  And as you can hear, they're just sitting around waiting.
[04:00:30.193 --> 04:00:32.816]  It's now 8 o'clock central and 25 seconds.
[04:00:35.900 --> 04:00:37.082]  C-SPAN is saying 3 minutes.
[04:00:37.242 --> 04:00:38.303]  We've got atomic clocks.
[04:00:39.104 --> 04:00:40.626]  As you can see, C-SPAN says it is.
[04:00:42.216 --> 04:00:47.039]  It is 6 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Central, 7 o'clock Mountain, 9 o'clock Eastern.
[04:00:47.059 --> 04:00:47.819]  We've got our own feed.
[04:00:47.879 --> 04:00:52.062]  Let's maybe put our feed up there from RightSide, which as you can notice, it's the same feed.
[04:00:52.082 --> 04:00:53.363]  We also subscribe to the same feed.
[04:00:53.383 --> 04:00:55.804]  But we've been partnering with RightSide because they're great folks.
[04:00:55.864 --> 04:00:57.265]  They're also donation supported.
[04:00:57.665 --> 04:01:00.567]  We're supported by some sponsors, but we are also supported just by the high quality.
[04:01:01.127 --> 04:01:06.388]  Nutraceutical supplements and products at Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[04:01:06.428 --> 04:01:10.929]  This is the house the people built, now reaching upwards of 30 million people a week, conservatively.
[04:01:11.309 --> 04:01:12.050]  Hillary has a name.
[04:01:12.070 --> 04:01:13.850]  This is the number one enemy she wants to shut down.
[04:01:14.230 --> 04:01:18.211]  She says the alt-right, meaning true liberals, Thomas Everson style, have no right to exist.
[04:01:18.311 --> 04:01:19.271]  Talk about Hitlerian.
[04:01:19.691 --> 04:01:21.152]  The press has no right to exist.
[04:01:21.752 --> 04:01:26.873]  They admit Obama's been three times worse in the press than anybody in history, but that's okay because it's liberal.
[04:01:28.140 --> 04:01:30.223]  So there's Anderson Cooper, and how do you pronounce her name?
[04:01:30.303 --> 04:01:30.783]  Radicus?
[04:01:30.863 --> 04:01:31.144]  Ratty?
[04:01:31.204 --> 04:01:31.484]  Ratty?
[04:01:32.405 --> 04:01:34.087]  Uh, the old... Raddatz?
[04:01:34.107 --> 04:01:34.768]  The old piranha?
[04:01:35.168 --> 04:01:38.733]  We're all here about how old... Clinton and Hillary are great to women!
[04:01:40.509 --> 04:01:41.750]  And how horrible Trump is.
[04:01:41.790 --> 04:01:45.953]  They got a fake rape lawsuit of little kids tomorrow with, you know, all this stuff.
[04:01:46.013 --> 04:01:47.154]  It's just all so cute.
[04:01:47.614 --> 04:01:48.555]  It's all so wonderful.
[04:01:48.935 --> 04:01:50.476]  Jane Doe's, made up stuff.
[04:01:50.596 --> 04:01:52.217]  Bill Clinton, we know he's on the rape express.
[04:01:52.658 --> 04:01:53.298]  We know he's involved.
[04:01:53.318 --> 04:01:54.339]  We knew Trump was going to bring this up.
[04:01:54.359 --> 04:01:55.380]  This is a nuclear option.
[04:01:55.580 --> 04:01:57.241]  They said, hey, bud, we'll just have it on us.
[04:01:57.261 --> 04:01:59.462]  People go file a lawsuit in a district judge in New York.
[04:01:59.783 --> 04:02:02.485]  We control and see how you like that.
[04:02:03.345 --> 04:02:04.526]  Everybody wants to bitch about Trump.
[04:02:04.586 --> 04:02:05.667]  He's the man in the arena.
[04:02:06.371 --> 04:02:07.492]  He's the man in the arena.
[04:02:07.812 --> 04:02:09.412]  He's our champion fighting globalism.
[04:02:09.792 --> 04:02:12.754]  Just like UKIP and Nigel Farage has been coaching him for a week.
[04:02:14.154 --> 04:02:15.535]  I'll get Nigel Farage on next week, by the way.
[04:02:15.555 --> 04:02:17.216]  He said he wanted to come back on.
[04:02:17.276 --> 04:02:17.856]  And this is it.
[04:02:17.916 --> 04:02:19.136]  You want to get out of the New World Order?
[04:02:19.657 --> 04:02:24.879]  You don't want the establishment, everybody keeps claiming they don't want to be part of the New World Order and the Federal Reserve and them selling our jobs to China?
[04:02:26.152 --> 04:02:30.299]  But it's time to be honest with yourselves and know then you have to break from the mind control.
[04:02:30.319 --> 04:02:31.901]  I know the average viewer here has.
[04:02:32.663 --> 04:02:34.245]  But you've got to send this link out to everybody.
[04:02:34.626 --> 04:02:36.068]  I have a way of breaking people's mind control.
[04:02:36.108 --> 04:02:36.449]  So do you.
[04:02:37.535 --> 04:02:48.586]  Our listeners are out there charging in everywhere, injecting the truth at these live events, and shaking the globalist up, and letting these arrogant monsters know they're not invincible, they're not God, when they sell us out.
[04:02:49.347 --> 04:02:54.332]  You're tuning in, this is InfoWars.com on radio and TV stations across the country, the streams, you can send out to everybody.
[04:02:54.632 --> 04:02:57.195]  You're driving down the road to see Albuquerque, New Mexico, listen right now, that's great.
[04:02:57.535 --> 04:03:00.018]  Tell folks about the station that you're listening to.
[04:03:00.478 --> 04:03:05.481]  But also tell people about Infowars.com forward slash show for the free audio and video feeds.
[04:03:05.921 --> 04:03:07.382]  There's that evil Donald Jr.
[04:03:07.402 --> 04:03:10.424]  that keeps sending out links to Infowars.com.
[04:03:10.844 --> 04:03:14.446]  The media has told him, Donald, you don't do that or we'll say bad things about you.
[04:03:14.947 --> 04:03:18.129]  But if your dad's nice to us, we'll make up pedophile allegations, even worse.
[04:03:18.769 --> 04:03:20.230]  You're in the arena with scum.
[04:03:20.570 --> 04:03:25.533]  They're going to give you no quarter, charge in 199%, or you're going to lose everything.
[04:03:25.793 --> 04:03:26.594]  It's all the line.
[04:03:26.794 --> 04:03:29.876]  Trump must attack with the truth and the incredible hypocrisy of Hillary.
[04:03:30.276 --> 04:03:33.957]  She's like, you made fun of a fat lady because she wouldn't do her job.
[04:03:34.677 --> 04:03:35.117]  OK!
[04:03:35.377 --> 04:03:36.038]  Into the world!
[04:03:36.098 --> 04:03:36.618]  Oh my God!
[04:03:36.678 --> 04:03:39.178]  You funded jihadis to run around raping and killing women!
[04:03:40.119 --> 04:03:46.540]  You support and defend pedophiles you know are guilty that brutalized and put 14-year-old girls or 12-year-old girls in comas!
[04:03:46.980 --> 04:03:47.701]  You're a monster!
[04:03:47.881 --> 04:03:48.521]  You're a pig!
[04:03:48.761 --> 04:03:49.401]  You're a criminal!
[04:03:49.601 --> 04:03:50.101]  You lied!
[04:03:50.121 --> 04:03:52.102]  You stood down in Benghazi and people died!
[04:03:53.018 --> 04:03:56.200]  How dare you in the media rig this thing in front of the American people?
[04:03:56.800 --> 04:04:01.923]  How dare you put Homeland Security over the election with the UN and the EU?
[04:04:02.664 --> 04:04:07.367]  How dare you try to sell all these frauds and create all these derivatives and the Glass-Steagall act and screw everybody over?
[04:04:07.607 --> 04:04:08.888]  How dare you try this?
[04:04:09.448 --> 04:04:10.208]  How do you know Trump's good?
[04:04:11.289 --> 04:04:12.470]  The whole establishment's against him.
[04:04:13.510 --> 04:04:18.212]  They're trying to destroy him, and nobody would do this job and be one of their insiders as a show, because they're going after him.
[04:04:18.392 --> 04:04:19.632]  They're trying to ruin his businesses.
[04:04:20.212 --> 04:04:21.173]  They're trying to bankrupt him.
[04:04:21.193 --> 04:04:22.293]  All right, here we go.
[04:04:22.313 --> 04:04:23.774]  Let's go to the CIA operatives.
[04:04:23.794 --> 04:04:24.594]  And I'm Anderson Cooper.
[04:04:24.614 --> 04:04:24.994]  Here they are.
[04:04:25.194 --> 04:04:27.635]  And we want to welcome you to Washington University in St.
[04:04:27.675 --> 04:04:31.256]  Louis for the second presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
[04:04:31.276 --> 04:04:32.257]  This is not technically a debate.
[04:04:32.277 --> 04:04:32.937]  It's a town hall.
[04:04:32.977 --> 04:04:35.318]  He will interrupt the whole time with fact-checking, which is BS.
[04:04:35.498 --> 04:04:36.019]  He's got to see.
[04:04:36.059 --> 04:04:37.540]  We ought to have him as president.
[04:04:37.600 --> 04:04:38.121]  That'll be rigged.
[04:04:48.846 --> 04:04:52.769]  The people you see on this stage were chosen by the Gallup organization.
[04:04:53.089 --> 04:04:54.170]  They're all from the St.
[04:04:54.210 --> 04:04:58.113]  Louis area and they haven't committed to a candidate.
[04:04:58.193 --> 04:04:58.734]  Oh sure!
[04:04:58.794 --> 04:05:05.059]  Each of them came here with questions they want to ask and we saw those questions for the first time this morning.
[04:05:05.539 --> 04:05:09.522]  Anderson and I and our team from ABC and CNN are the only ones who've seen them.
[04:05:11.744 --> 04:05:16.668]  Both candidates will have two minutes to answer each audience and online question.
[04:05:17.008 --> 04:05:24.974]  We hope to get to as many questions as we can, so we've asked the audience not to slow things down with any applause.
[04:05:24.994 --> 04:05:26.456]  It's up for now.
[04:05:26.636 --> 04:05:34.642]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Republican nominee for President, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for President, Hillary Clinton.
[04:05:34.682 --> 04:05:36.543]  Yay, Hitler!
[04:05:36.643 --> 04:05:39.726]  Oh, look, she can walk!
[04:05:41.969 --> 04:05:44.811]  Hello, it's the Joker!
[04:05:44.871 --> 04:05:46.452]  All right, I'm going to stop now.
[04:05:46.732 --> 04:05:47.692]  I'm going to stop now for five minutes.
[04:05:47.732 --> 04:05:49.113]  No more talking.
[04:05:49.153 --> 04:05:49.794]  Infowars.com.
[04:05:50.034 --> 04:05:51.995]  We have the free feed of Right Side of Infowars if you want that.
[04:05:52.615 --> 04:05:53.676]  We'll be on after the debate, too.
[04:05:54.937 --> 04:05:55.757]  This is the second debate.
[04:05:55.777 --> 04:05:58.699]  Now, Trump, we're going to see what happens.
[04:06:01.024 --> 04:06:02.105]  Thank you very much for being here.
[04:06:02.145 --> 04:06:06.408]  We're going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall.
[04:06:06.428 --> 04:06:07.328]  There was no handshake.
[04:06:07.368 --> 04:06:09.290]  We'll have two minutes to respond to this question.
[04:06:09.310 --> 04:06:11.952]  Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you'll go first.
[04:06:12.012 --> 04:06:14.453]  Our first question comes from Patrice Brock.
[04:06:14.894 --> 04:06:15.254]  Patrice?
[04:06:17.035 --> 04:06:18.116]  Thank you and good evening.
[04:06:18.936 --> 04:06:25.960]  The last presidential debate could have been rated as MA, Mature Audiences, per TV Parental Guidelines.
[04:06:26.480 --> 04:06:34.585]  Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debate to students' homework, do you feel you are modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today's youth?
[04:06:35.185 --> 04:06:35.785]  Well, thank you.
[04:06:36.046 --> 04:06:36.666]  Are you a teacher?
[04:06:38.781 --> 04:06:51.150]  Yes, I think that that's a very good question because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.
[04:06:52.071 --> 04:07:01.839]  And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.
[04:07:02.699 --> 04:07:06.783]  And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up.
[04:07:07.523 --> 04:07:22.613]  We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl as well as every adult to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.
[04:07:22.954 --> 04:07:26.996]  I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.
[04:07:27.397 --> 04:07:30.399]  That's why the slogan of my campaign is Stronger Together.
[04:07:30.879 --> 04:07:55.810]  Because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals, and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college, and making it affordable, and so much else.
[04:07:56.210 --> 04:08:00.292]  If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them,
[04:08:00.632 --> 04:08:03.734]  There's nothing, in my opinion, that America can't do.
[04:08:04.154 --> 04:08:08.696]  So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.
[04:08:09.276 --> 04:08:11.598]  Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote.
[04:08:12.098 --> 04:08:14.059]  I'm hoping to be elected in November.
[04:08:14.479 --> 04:08:17.361]  And I can promise you, I will work with every American.
[04:08:17.441 --> 04:08:25.084]  I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.
[04:08:25.545 --> 04:08:27.726]  I want us to heal our country and bring it together.
[04:08:28.286 --> 04:08:33.470]  Because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.
[04:08:33.830 --> 04:08:34.791]  Secretary Clinton, thank you.
[04:08:34.811 --> 04:08:35.851]  Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.
[04:08:36.572 --> 04:08:37.933]  Well, I actually agree with that.
[04:08:38.353 --> 04:08:40.635]  I agree with everything she said.
[04:08:41.735 --> 04:08:48.720]  I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country.
[04:08:49.481 --> 04:08:50.582]  This is a great country.
[04:08:50.602 --> 04:08:51.742]  This is a great land.
[04:08:51.762 --> 04:08:56.346]  I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year and a half that I've been
[04:08:57.046 --> 04:08:58.728]  Doing this as a politician.
[04:08:59.269 --> 04:09:02.852]  I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.
[04:09:03.633 --> 04:09:07.477]  And my whole concept was to make America great again.
[04:09:07.557 --> 04:09:12.342]  When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with
[04:09:13.203 --> 04:09:19.749]  Some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68%, 59%, 71%.
[04:09:23.192 --> 04:09:36.083]  And when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really the number one terrorist state.
[04:09:36.123 --> 04:09:40.246]  We've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.
[04:09:41.207 --> 04:09:47.369]  When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential.
[04:09:48.029 --> 04:09:51.491]  Whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly.
[04:09:52.371 --> 04:09:56.472]  Last year we had an almost $800 billion trade deficit.
[04:09:56.512 --> 04:10:02.555]  In other words, trading with other countries, we had an $800 billion deficit.
[04:10:02.675 --> 04:10:03.435]  It's hard to believe.
[04:10:03.575 --> 04:10:04.395]  Inconceivable.
[04:10:04.855 --> 04:10:06.236]  You say, who's making these deals?
[04:10:06.836 --> 04:10:08.017]  We're going to make great trade deals.
[04:10:08.057 --> 04:10:09.097]  We're going to have a strong border.
[04:10:09.117 --> 04:10:11.138]  We're going to bring back law and order.
[04:10:11.819 --> 04:10:15.561]  Just today, a policeman was shot, two killed.
[04:10:16.381 --> 04:10:18.162]  And this is happening on a weekly basis.
[04:10:18.902 --> 04:10:22.784]  We have to bring back respect to law enforcement.
[04:10:23.204 --> 04:10:25.466]  At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.
[04:10:25.506 --> 04:10:26.246]  We need justice.
[04:10:27.286 --> 04:10:36.071]  But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African American citizens that are so great.
[04:10:36.671 --> 04:10:38.612]  And for the Latinos, Hispanics.
[04:10:39.492 --> 04:10:40.793]  And I look forward to doing it.
[04:10:40.813 --> 04:10:43.734]  It's called Make America Great Again.
[04:10:43.934 --> 04:10:44.715]  Thank you, Mr. Trump.
[04:10:45.395 --> 04:10:50.557]  The question from Patrice was about, are you both modeling positive and appropriate behaviors for today's youth?
[04:10:51.117 --> 04:10:54.859]  We've received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday.
[04:10:54.879 --> 04:10:58.321]  As you can imagine, you called what you said locker room banter.
[04:10:58.541 --> 04:11:01.442]  You just stopped some women without consent grabbing their genitals.
[04:11:01.782 --> 04:11:03.163]  That is sexual assault.
[04:11:03.823 --> 04:11:05.344]  You bragged that you have sent baseballs to come in.
[04:11:05.364 --> 04:11:05.844]  This is a rigged debate!
[04:11:05.864 --> 04:11:06.904]  Do you understand that?
[04:11:07.104 --> 04:11:08.025]  Get ready for the gloves to come off.
[04:11:08.045 --> 04:11:08.685]  No, I didn't say that at all.
[04:11:08.725 --> 04:11:10.526]  I don't think you understood what was said.
[04:11:10.566 --> 04:11:12.086]  This was locker room talk.
[04:11:13.087 --> 04:11:13.907]  I'm not proud of it.
[04:11:14.567 --> 04:11:15.988]  I apologize to my family.
[04:11:16.028 --> 04:11:17.828]  I apologize to the American people.
[04:11:18.229 --> 04:11:19.409]  Certainly I'm not proud of it.
[04:11:20.029 --> 04:11:21.650]  But this is locker room talk.
[04:11:21.670 --> 04:11:29.473]  You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have, and frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have
[04:11:30.213 --> 04:11:30.373]  This is
[04:11:47.961 --> 04:11:48.521]  With ISIS.
[04:11:49.121 --> 04:11:51.462]  And they look at our country and they say it's better.
[04:11:51.562 --> 04:11:52.743]  I'm very embarrassed by it.
[04:11:53.163 --> 04:11:53.583]  I hate it.
[04:11:53.983 --> 04:11:55.404]  But it's locker room talk.
[04:11:55.784 --> 04:11:57.385]  And it's one of those things.
[04:11:57.605 --> 04:11:59.865]  I will knock the hell out of ISIS.
[04:12:00.386 --> 04:12:01.506]  We're going to defeat ISIS.
[04:12:01.626 --> 04:12:07.908]  ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment.
[04:12:08.149 --> 04:12:08.829]  And I will tell you.
[04:12:09.756 --> 04:12:10.917]  I will take care of ISIS.
[04:12:11.197 --> 04:12:12.438]  I have great respect for women.
[04:12:12.458 --> 04:12:14.540]  Nobody has more respect for women than I do.
[04:12:32.273 --> 04:12:34.414]  You hear these things, they're said.
[04:12:34.514 --> 04:12:35.574]  Yes Vanderbilt!
[04:12:36.214 --> 04:12:38.855]  He settles rape cases!
[04:12:38.975 --> 04:12:39.795]  Get back!
[04:12:40.155 --> 04:12:41.575]  And I will tell you, no I have not.
[04:12:42.135 --> 04:12:45.076]  And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe.
[04:12:45.556 --> 04:12:48.177]  We're going to have borders on our country, which we don't have now.
[04:12:48.517 --> 04:12:49.817]  And he hasn't settled rape cases.
[04:12:50.277 --> 04:12:51.918]  You know Anderson, you're the CIA.
[04:12:51.958 --> 04:12:53.118]  All these questions have been against me.
[04:12:53.138 --> 04:12:54.858]  We're going to make America safe again.
[04:12:54.878 --> 04:12:57.299]  We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.
[04:12:57.319 --> 04:12:57.899]  I didn't settle rape cases!
[04:12:58.339 --> 04:13:07.067]  We're going to make America wealthy again because if you don't do that, it just sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.
[04:13:07.087 --> 04:13:10.170]  Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth.
[04:13:10.190 --> 04:13:11.972]  And that's what I want to talk about.
[04:13:14.721 --> 04:13:23.363]  Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.
[04:13:23.383 --> 04:13:24.323]  Now you represent pedophiles.
[04:13:24.343 --> 04:13:32.726]  You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles.
[04:13:32.766 --> 04:13:33.986]  Like the Bushes you vacation with.
[04:13:34.006 --> 04:13:36.547]  But I never questioned their fitness to serve.
[04:13:38.757 --> 04:13:39.797]  Donald Trump is different.
[04:13:40.658 --> 04:13:48.060]  I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander in chief.
[04:13:48.220 --> 04:13:51.841]  And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.
[04:13:53.981 --> 04:14:00.623]  What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women.
[04:14:01.484 --> 04:14:02.544]  What he thinks about women.
[04:14:03.598 --> 04:14:10.241]  What he does to women, and he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.
[04:14:11.441 --> 04:14:17.444]  But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.
[04:14:18.064 --> 04:14:20.165]  Because we've seen this throughout the campaign.
[04:14:20.225 --> 04:14:21.666]  We've seen him insult women.
[04:14:21.686 --> 04:14:23.687]  We've seen him rate women.
[04:14:27.645 --> 04:14:30.586]  On their appearance, ranking them from 1 to 10.
[04:14:30.646 --> 04:14:31.507]  What about rape them?
[04:14:32.267 --> 04:14:35.809]  We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.
[04:14:37.249 --> 04:14:42.492]  We saw him, after the first debate, spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe.
[04:14:42.512 --> 04:14:43.372]  It's a total crucifixion of Trump.
[04:14:43.452 --> 04:14:44.632]  I cannot believe he's not striking back.
[04:14:44.652 --> 04:14:46.553]  In the harshest, most personal terms.
[04:14:46.853 --> 04:14:47.454]  Please go ahead.
[04:14:47.474 --> 04:14:50.075]  So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.
[04:14:51.749 --> 04:14:59.333]  But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president.
[04:15:00.514 --> 04:15:12.340]  Because he has also targeted immigrants, African Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.
[04:15:13.321 --> 04:15:19.424]  So this is who Donald Trump is, and the question for us, the question our country must answer
[04:15:21.229 --> 04:15:23.590]  Is that this is not who we are.
[04:15:23.690 --> 04:15:25.471]  She wants no borders, she doesn't want us to have a country.
[04:15:25.491 --> 04:15:34.215]  That's why, to go back to your question, I want to send a message, we all should, to every boy and girl, and indeed to the entire world.
[04:15:35.489 --> 04:15:38.731]  That America already is great, but we are great because we are good.
[04:15:39.251 --> 04:15:40.032]  Oh, we're good.
[04:15:40.132 --> 04:15:40.432]  You're good.
[04:15:40.452 --> 04:15:41.893]  And we will respect one another.
[04:15:42.293 --> 04:15:43.995]  And we will work with one another.
[04:15:44.015 --> 04:15:44.815]  She's so good.
[04:15:44.895 --> 04:15:46.937]  And we will celebrate our diversity.
[04:15:46.977 --> 04:15:49.538]  When she turns her country over to jihadists that kill all the Christians, she's good.
[04:15:49.558 --> 04:15:52.941]  These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.
[04:15:52.961 --> 04:15:54.682]  When she orders Benghazi stand-downs, she's good.
[04:15:54.702 --> 04:16:02.387]  And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.
[04:16:03.425 --> 04:16:05.509]  And we want to get to some questions from online.
[04:16:05.529 --> 04:16:06.692]  Oh, you can't respond to that.
[04:16:06.712 --> 04:16:08.074]  Yes, you can respond to that.
[04:16:10.828 --> 04:16:13.029]  It's just words, folks, it's just words.
[04:16:13.650 --> 04:16:15.451]  Those words, I've been hearing them for many years.
[04:16:16.452 --> 04:16:25.437]  I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was gonna bring back jobs to upstate New York, and she failed.
[04:16:26.018 --> 04:16:36.244]  I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster, education-wise, job-wise, safety-wise.
[04:16:37.305 --> 04:16:38.426]  In every way possible.
[04:16:39.187 --> 04:16:40.809]  I'm going to help the African Americans.
[04:16:40.889 --> 04:16:43.212]  I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics.
[04:16:44.113 --> 04:16:45.955]  I am going to help the inner cities.
[04:16:45.995 --> 04:16:49.558]  She's done a terrible job for the African Americans.
[04:16:49.639 --> 04:16:53.202]  She wants their vote and she does nothing and then she comes back four years later.
[04:16:53.983 --> 04:16:57.609]  We saw that firsthand when she was a United States Senator.
[04:16:57.629 --> 04:17:04.479]  She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign... Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, I want to get to audience questions and online questions.
[04:17:04.519 --> 04:17:07.163]  So she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond.
[04:17:07.524 --> 04:17:09.046]  You're going to get to respond right now.
[04:17:09.066 --> 04:17:09.507]  That sounds fair.
[04:17:09.967 --> 04:17:12.451]  This tape is generating intense interest.
[04:17:12.511 --> 04:17:20.303]  In just 48 hours, it's become the most talked about story of the entire 2016 election.
[04:17:20.624 --> 04:17:23.148]  With millions and millions of people discussing it.
[04:17:25.310 --> 04:17:30.472]  As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around the country via social media.
[04:17:30.512 --> 04:17:33.133]  And our first stays on this topic.
[04:17:33.173 --> 04:17:38.855]  Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, Trump says the campaign has changed him.
[04:17:39.395 --> 04:17:40.436]  When did that happen?
[04:17:40.976 --> 04:17:42.537]  So Mr. Trump, let me add to that.
[04:17:42.577 --> 04:17:51.322]  When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently?
[04:17:51.762 --> 04:17:53.703]  And you have two minutes for this.
[04:17:54.023 --> 04:17:55.244]  That was locker room talk.
[04:17:56.164 --> 04:17:57.045]  I'm not proud of it.
[04:17:57.885 --> 04:18:03.670]  I am a person who has had respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.
[04:18:04.350 --> 04:18:05.611]  And certainly I'm not proud of it.
[04:18:06.172 --> 04:18:11.316]  But that was something that... To his credit, he did have the right victims and abuse victims on reporters on press conference.
[04:18:12.056 --> 04:18:13.637]  So I'm going to hold back for now, Trump.
[04:18:13.697 --> 04:18:14.558]  And his was action.
[04:18:15.099 --> 04:18:16.700]  His was what he said to women.
[04:18:16.720 --> 04:18:22.404]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[04:18:23.105 --> 04:18:25.667]  So you can say any way you want to say it.
[04:18:26.367 --> 04:18:28.889]  But Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[04:18:29.249 --> 04:18:35.432]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight.
[04:18:36.133 --> 04:18:41.536]  One of the women, who is a wonderful woman at 12 years old, was raped.
[04:18:42.423 --> 04:18:42.803]  At 12.
[04:18:43.644 --> 04:18:51.049]  Her client, she represented, got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.
[04:18:51.970 --> 04:18:55.453]  Kathy Shelton, that young woman, is here with us tonight.
[04:18:56.413 --> 04:18:58.555]  So don't tell me about words.
[04:18:58.975 --> 04:19:02.137]  I am absolutely, I apologize for those words.
[04:19:03.218 --> 04:19:05.921]  But it is things that people say.
[04:19:06.441 --> 04:19:11.866]  But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.
[04:19:12.646 --> 04:19:20.033]  He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.
[04:19:20.934 --> 04:19:28.260]  And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that, that she talks about words that I said 11 years ago.
[04:19:30.157 --> 04:19:34.298]  I think it's disgraceful and I think she should be ashamed of herself if you want to know the truth.
[04:19:34.938 --> 04:19:35.799]  You came through, Trump!
[04:19:36.459 --> 04:19:36.919]  Yeah!
[04:19:37.039 --> 04:19:38.159]  Yeah!
[04:19:38.259 --> 04:19:38.920]  Damn right!
[04:19:39.180 --> 04:19:40.320]  I'm turning the mic off now!
[04:19:40.440 --> 04:19:41.600]  Yeah, Trump's for real!
[04:19:42.761 --> 04:19:51.423]  Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[04:19:51.583 --> 04:19:53.624]  He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.
[04:19:54.560 --> 04:20:05.866]  Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.
[04:20:07.126 --> 04:20:13.549]  When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend Michelle Obama advised us all.
[04:20:14.790 --> 04:20:16.671]  When they go low, you go high.
[04:20:24.153 --> 04:20:31.701]  If this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable.
[04:20:32.521 --> 04:20:40.149]  But everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women.
[04:20:41.671 --> 04:20:44.834]  But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.
[04:20:46.192 --> 04:20:51.336]  He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family.
[04:20:51.376 --> 04:20:52.677]  The Gold Star family?
[04:20:52.697 --> 04:20:53.818]  When you won't get that, it would be treatment.
[04:20:53.838 --> 04:21:02.624]  Captain Khan died in the line of duty in Iraq, and Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.
[04:21:02.644 --> 04:21:04.666]  You're the one bringing jihadis in, lady.
[04:21:04.686 --> 04:21:10.250]  He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge, who was born in Indiana.
[04:21:12.110 --> 04:21:26.754]  But Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because... It's like the judge Obama appointed that's... He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.
[04:21:27.474 --> 04:21:30.535]  And he never apologized for the racist lie.
[04:21:31.752 --> 04:21:36.055]  That President Obama was not born in the United States of America.
[04:21:36.096 --> 04:21:37.477]  He owes the President an apology.
[04:21:37.497 --> 04:21:38.557]  He said that in his Harvard Review papers.
[04:21:38.598 --> 04:21:40.039]  He owes our country an apology.
[04:21:40.059 --> 04:21:41.240]  We know it's Frank Marshall Davis now, lady.
[04:21:41.280 --> 04:21:45.283]  And he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.
[04:21:46.204 --> 04:21:46.844]  Your actions?
[04:21:46.904 --> 04:21:56.312]  Well, you owe the President an apology because, as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal, he's another real winner that you have.
[04:21:56.612 --> 04:22:01.336]  And he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just
[04:22:01.856 --> 04:22:06.598]  Two weeks ago, she was saying exactly that, so you really owe him an apology.
[04:22:06.618 --> 04:22:12.501]  You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.
[04:22:12.822 --> 04:22:16.483]  That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.
[04:22:17.104 --> 04:22:18.684]  Number two, Michelle Obama.
[04:22:19.725 --> 04:22:27.429]  I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you, and I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen.
[04:22:28.420 --> 04:22:31.424]  Of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.
[04:22:32.205 --> 04:22:37.732]  So you talked about friend, go back and take a look at those commercials.
[04:22:37.972 --> 04:22:43.178]  A race where you lost, fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race where
[04:22:44.039 --> 04:22:46.240]  You won, but not fair and square, in my opinion.
[04:22:46.281 --> 04:22:46.701]  Good job.
[04:22:47.041 --> 04:22:54.105]  And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they said about Bernie Sanders and see what Debra Wasserman Schultz had in mind.
[04:22:54.146 --> 04:22:54.726]  Good job, Trump.
[04:22:54.886 --> 04:22:56.127]  You stole that nomination.
[04:22:56.167 --> 04:22:59.629]  Between superdelegates and Debra Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.
[04:22:59.749 --> 04:23:02.971]  And I was so surprised to see him going on with the devil.
[04:23:03.792 --> 04:23:05.253]  But when you talk about apology...
[04:23:06.073 --> 04:23:16.939]  I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 emails that you deleted and that you acid washed.
[04:23:17.639 --> 04:23:24.283]  And then the two boxes of emails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.
[04:23:24.343 --> 04:23:25.324]  Notice she's sitting down.
[04:23:25.344 --> 04:23:25.884]  I'll tell you what.
[04:23:29.654 --> 04:23:41.017]  I hate to say it, but if I win, I am going to instruct my Attorney General to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation.
[04:23:41.077 --> 04:23:47.538]  Because there has never been so many lies, so much deception, there has never been anything like it.
[04:23:47.678 --> 04:23:49.719]  And we're gonna have a special prosecutor.
[04:23:50.299 --> 04:23:54.480]  When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are free.
[04:23:55.400 --> 04:24:00.403]  In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.
[04:24:00.743 --> 04:24:05.225]  There has never been anything like this, where emails and you get a subpoena- Look at her, he's standing up to that witch.
[04:24:05.245 --> 04:24:10.068]  You get a subpoena and after- She's gonna say he's a pedophile tomorrow with her own judge, with no name.
[04:24:10.128 --> 04:24:11.769]  And then you have to watch.
[04:24:11.789 --> 04:24:13.430]  Magically he's a pedophile tomorrow, watch.
[04:24:13.450 --> 04:24:14.910]  It's a very expensive process.
[04:24:15.911 --> 04:24:19.633]  So we're gonna get a special prosecutor and we're gonna look into it, because you know what?
[04:24:20.133 --> 04:24:21.114]  People have been
[04:24:22.214 --> 04:24:25.877]  Their lives have been destroyed for doing one monstrous of what you've done.
[04:24:26.057 --> 04:24:26.877]  And it's a disgrace.
[04:24:27.118 --> 04:24:29.239]  And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[04:24:41.067 --> 04:24:41.767]  We're good.
[04:24:57.995 --> 04:25:00.297]  Fact check him in real time.
[04:25:00.497 --> 04:25:17.329]  Last time at the first debate we had millions of people fact-checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact-checking because, you know, it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
[04:25:17.989 --> 04:25:18.910]  Because you'd be in jail.
[04:25:23.408 --> 04:25:30.370]  We want to remind the audience to please not... Please only cheer for Hillary.
[04:25:30.450 --> 04:25:32.111]  Please do not applaud, you're just wasting time.
[04:25:32.171 --> 04:25:35.192]  As a major Vanderbilt, I need to ask her myself.
[04:25:35.252 --> 04:25:38.053]  You've said your handling of your emails was a mistake.
[04:25:38.093 --> 04:25:45.715]  You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, extremely careless.
[04:25:46.175 --> 04:25:56.639]  The FBI said that there were 110 classified emails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those emails.
[04:25:57.119 --> 04:25:58.840]  You don't call that extremely careless?
[04:25:59.360 --> 04:26:04.062]  Well, Martha, first let me say, and I've said it before, but I'll repeat it because I want everyone to hear it.
[04:26:04.522 --> 04:26:10.345]  That was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal email account.
[04:26:11.245 --> 04:26:13.986]  Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not.
[04:26:14.206 --> 04:26:15.646]  I'm not making any excuses.
[04:26:15.666 --> 04:26:17.727]  Would you have made Lydia Villafelste a mistake?
[04:26:18.327 --> 04:26:20.327]  I'm very sorry about that.
[04:26:20.428 --> 04:26:30.310]  But I think it's also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others.
[04:26:31.470 --> 04:26:36.772]  After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked
[04:26:37.608 --> 04:26:50.738]  The server I was using, and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all, anyone who says otherwise has no basis, that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.
[04:26:50.898 --> 04:26:55.342]  I take classified materials very seriously, and always have.
[04:26:55.382 --> 04:27:02.688]  When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material, obviously as Secretary of State.
[04:27:03.468 --> 04:27:10.370]  I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after Bin Laden.
[04:27:10.850 --> 04:27:20.712]  So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously, and as I said, there is no evidence of any classified information.
[04:27:20.852 --> 04:27:22.333]  Ended up in the wrong hands.
[04:27:22.373 --> 04:27:27.394]  And yet, she didn't know the letter C on a document.
[04:27:28.254 --> 04:27:28.474]  Right?
[04:27:28.674 --> 04:27:31.557]  She didn't even know what that word, what that letter meant.
[04:27:31.977 --> 04:27:32.797]  You know, it's amazing.
[04:27:32.837 --> 04:27:34.819]  I'm watching Hillary go over facts.
[04:27:35.680 --> 04:27:37.641]  And she's going after fact after fact.
[04:27:37.741 --> 04:27:42.705]  And she's lying again because she said she, you know, what she did with the emails was fine.
[04:27:42.745 --> 04:27:44.106]  You think it was fine to delete 33,000 emails?
[04:27:44.126 --> 04:27:44.606]  I don't think so.
[04:27:46.227 --> 04:27:52.169]  She said the 33,000 emails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class.
[04:27:52.209 --> 04:27:55.890]  Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something.
[04:27:56.090 --> 04:27:57.270]  33,000 emails deleted.
[04:27:57.630 --> 04:27:59.691]  And now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.
[04:28:00.131 --> 04:28:02.352]  And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.
[04:28:02.372 --> 04:28:04.092]  That wasn't before, that was after.
[04:28:04.172 --> 04:28:05.793]  She got it from the United States Congress.
[04:28:06.133 --> 04:28:12.475]  And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for
[04:28:13.795 --> 04:28:23.518]  Allowing this to happen, our Justice Department, where her husband goes onto the back of an airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the Attorney General days before a ruling is going to be made on her case.
[04:28:24.339 --> 04:28:34.782]  But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 emails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself, what you did.
[04:28:34.982 --> 04:28:36.903]  And this is after getting a subpoena.
[04:28:37.623 --> 04:28:38.884]  From the United States Congress.
[04:28:38.904 --> 04:28:39.484]  We have to move on.
[04:28:39.504 --> 04:28:41.166]  Secretary Clinton, you can respond and then we have to move on.
[04:28:41.186 --> 04:28:44.348]  We want to give the audience a chance here.
[04:28:44.608 --> 04:28:47.911]  Let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.
[04:28:47.931 --> 04:28:50.132]  Secretary Clinton, you can respond and then we have to move on to an audience question.
[04:28:50.473 --> 04:28:55.957]  Look, it's just not true and so please allow her to respond, please.
[04:28:55.977 --> 04:28:59.439]  Personal emails, not official.
[04:28:59.459 --> 04:28:59.439]  33,000?
[04:28:59.499 --> 04:29:03.682]  Well, we turned over 35,000, so it was... What about the other 15,000?
[04:29:03.762 --> 04:29:04.863]  Please allow her to respond.
[04:29:04.923 --> 04:29:05.864]  She didn't talk while you talked.
[04:29:06.877 --> 04:29:07.919]  Yes, that's true, I didn't.
[04:29:07.939 --> 04:29:18.075]  I did win the first debate and I'm going to try not to in this debate because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.
[04:29:18.196 --> 04:29:19.438]  And get off this question.
[04:29:21.957 --> 04:29:24.999]  Okay, Donald, I know you're into big diversion tonight.
[04:29:25.299 --> 04:29:30.302]  Anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you.
[04:29:30.322 --> 04:29:36.246]  But let's at least focus on some of the issues that people care about tonight.
[04:29:36.326 --> 04:29:37.567]  Let's get to their questions.
[04:29:37.587 --> 04:29:39.548]  We have a question here from Ken Karpowitz.
[04:29:39.588 --> 04:29:42.991]  Look, we've got Cooper and Rapp teamed up on him.
[04:29:43.111 --> 04:29:44.251]  I'm helping Donald, okay?
[04:29:44.311 --> 04:29:46.413]  I'd like to know, why aren't you bringing up the emails?
[04:29:46.453 --> 04:29:47.513]  It hasn't been finished.
[04:29:49.955 --> 04:29:51.076]  Tim Karpowitz has a question.
[04:29:51.096 --> 04:29:52.417]  It's nice to one-on-three.
[04:29:52.437 --> 04:29:53.819]  There you go!
[04:29:53.839 --> 04:29:54.319]  Donald gets it!
[04:29:54.699 --> 04:29:55.400]  One-on-three!
[04:29:55.440 --> 04:29:56.141]  Boom, baby!
[04:29:56.161 --> 04:29:57.402]  Two against three!
[04:29:57.602 --> 04:29:58.083]  Yes!
[04:29:58.163 --> 04:29:59.684]  It is not affordable.
[04:30:00.445 --> 04:30:01.626]  Premiums have gone up.
[04:30:02.066 --> 04:30:03.307]  Deductibles have gone up.
[04:30:03.908 --> 04:30:04.989]  Co-pays have gone up.
[04:30:05.549 --> 04:30:06.711]  Prescriptions have gone up.
[04:30:07.251 --> 04:30:08.732]  And the coverage has gone down.
[04:30:09.853 --> 04:30:14.458]  What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?
[04:30:15.031 --> 04:30:19.312]  That first one goes to Secretary Clinton because you started out the last one to the audience.
[04:30:19.332 --> 04:30:20.933]  Yeah, there you go, CIA interrupts.
[04:30:21.033 --> 04:30:21.953]  All gang up on Trump.
[04:30:21.973 --> 04:30:22.714]  No, go ahead, Donald.
[04:30:22.854 --> 04:30:23.834]  No, I'm a gentleman, Hillary.
[04:30:23.854 --> 04:30:24.154]  Go ahead.
[04:30:24.294 --> 04:30:25.034]  Secretary Clinton.
[04:30:25.074 --> 04:30:25.395]  Pig.
[04:30:26.475 --> 04:30:27.035]  Pig demon.
[04:30:28.736 --> 04:30:34.458]  Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.
[04:30:34.498 --> 04:30:36.919]  Oh yeah, the giant screw job that doesn't have increased premiums.
[04:30:36.939 --> 04:30:37.879]  Because I agree with you.
[04:30:38.615 --> 04:30:47.678]  Premiums have gotten too high, copays, deductible and prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.
[04:30:48.318 --> 04:30:56.961]  But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president.
[04:30:57.341 --> 04:31:05.729]  When the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million people got insurance who didn't have it before, but that in and of itself was a good thing.
[04:31:06.089 --> 04:31:12.094]  I meet these people all the time and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.
[04:31:12.975 --> 04:31:20.322]  But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employers,
[04:31:21.374 --> 04:31:22.354]  Got big benefits.
[04:31:22.414 --> 04:31:27.496]  Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.
[04:31:28.356 --> 04:31:34.518]  Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.
[04:31:34.638 --> 04:31:41.920]  Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.
[04:31:43.940 --> 04:31:49.703]  If you're under 26 and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26.
[04:31:49.763 --> 04:31:52.365]  Something that didn't happen before.
[04:31:52.385 --> 04:31:58.909]  So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.
[04:31:59.329 --> 04:32:00.770]  But we've got to get costs down.
[04:32:00.790 --> 04:32:07.574]  We've got to provide some additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.
[04:32:08.334 --> 04:32:16.956]  But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody.
[04:32:16.976 --> 04:32:18.617]  See, once they get you captured, you never get out of the system.
[04:32:18.657 --> 04:32:20.957]  Not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.
[04:32:20.977 --> 04:32:25.898]  And if the people bitching on YouTube don't want to hear my commentary, they're going to be on the right side feed on InfoWars for you.
[04:32:25.918 --> 04:32:28.099]  But right now we are at 90% health insurance coverage.
[04:32:28.119 --> 04:32:30.059]  That's the highest we've ever been in our country.
[04:32:30.079 --> 04:32:35.621]  So I want us to get to 100% but get costs down and keep quality up.
[04:32:35.981 --> 04:32:36.921]  Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.
[04:32:38.174 --> 04:32:44.698]  It is such a great question, and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.
[04:32:46.098 --> 04:32:47.499]  Obamacare is a disaster.
[04:32:48.340 --> 04:32:49.560]  You know it, we all know it.
[04:32:50.981 --> 04:32:54.443]  It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.
[04:32:54.523 --> 04:32:57.185]  Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for healthcare.
[04:32:57.965 --> 04:32:58.866]  It's only getting worse.
[04:32:59.106 --> 04:33:00.987]  In 17, it implodes by itself.
[04:33:01.914 --> 04:33:06.275]  Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.
[04:33:06.616 --> 04:33:09.516]  We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.
[04:33:09.536 --> 04:33:10.117]  Screw you more.
[04:33:10.297 --> 04:33:11.637]  Obamacare will never work.
[04:33:12.517 --> 04:33:15.738]  It's very bad, very bad health insurance.
[04:33:16.419 --> 04:33:22.561]  Far too expensive, and not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.
[04:33:22.581 --> 04:33:25.822]  It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.
[04:33:26.862 --> 04:33:29.363]  We have to repeal it and replace it.
[04:33:30.253 --> 04:33:35.554]  With something absolutely much less expensive and something that works.
[04:33:35.854 --> 04:33:38.435]  Just give people, poor people free is cheaper!
[04:33:38.455 --> 04:33:53.999]  We have to get rid of the lines around the state where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing because they wanted, President Obama and whoever was working on it, they want to leave those lines because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.
[04:33:54.539 --> 04:33:55.499]  We want competition.
[04:33:56.772 --> 04:34:00.035]  You will have the finest healthcare plan there is.
[04:34:00.055 --> 04:34:02.718]  She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster.
[04:34:02.958 --> 04:34:03.699]  Which was always the plan.
[04:34:03.719 --> 04:34:04.700]  Somewhat similar to Canada.
[04:34:05.141 --> 04:34:14.590]  And if you ever notice, the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States, in many cases, because their system is so slow.
[04:34:15.512 --> 04:34:17.995]  It's catastrophic in certain ways.
[04:34:18.316 --> 04:34:23.904]  But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything.
[04:34:23.944 --> 04:34:26.048]  Hillary Clinton has been after this for years.
[04:34:26.789 --> 04:34:28.451]  Obamacare was the first step.
[04:34:28.972 --> 04:34:31.095]  Obamacare is a total disaster.
[04:34:31.796 --> 04:34:38.681]  And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up.
[04:34:38.801 --> 04:34:42.523]  Unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.
[04:34:42.863 --> 04:34:47.346]  It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.
[04:34:47.586 --> 04:34:49.067]  Let me follow up with you.
[04:34:49.107 --> 04:34:56.432]  Your husband called Obamacare, quote, the craziest thing in the world, saying that small business owners are getting killed, as premiums double, coverage is cut in half.
[04:34:56.532 --> 04:34:59.754]  Was he mistaken, or was his mistake simply telling the truth?
[04:35:00.103 --> 04:35:02.947]  No, I mean he clarified what he meant and it's very clear.
[04:35:03.047 --> 04:35:08.494]  Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again...
[04:35:09.457 --> 04:35:11.378]  We might come up with a different system.
[04:35:11.518 --> 04:35:17.740]  But now we're in the scam, stay in it, let me gang rape you, murder a whole third world population.
[04:35:17.960 --> 04:35:23.663]  I'm a mass murderer, I support rapists, I support pedophiles, I'm Hillary the criminal with a big rubber hair.
[04:35:24.323 --> 04:35:29.485]  And couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid.
[04:35:30.305 --> 04:35:37.094]  Obviously Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way.
[04:35:37.594 --> 04:35:47.486]  And then all the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.
[04:35:48.127 --> 04:35:53.049]  That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take.
[04:35:53.429 --> 04:35:56.430]  And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.
[04:35:56.910 --> 04:36:03.973]  So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is, we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be.
[04:36:04.773 --> 04:36:13.882]  And that means the insurance companies get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma.
[04:36:13.902 --> 04:36:14.342]  Your time is up.
[04:36:14.523 --> 04:36:17.966]  You may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it.
[04:36:18.366 --> 04:36:24.733]  So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies.
[04:36:24.873 --> 04:36:25.693]  Let me follow up with you, Mr.
[04:36:26.294 --> 04:36:26.995]  That's not going to work.
[04:36:27.055 --> 04:36:28.075]  Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this.
[04:36:28.095 --> 04:36:29.056]  I just want to, just one thing.
[04:36:29.096 --> 04:36:31.178]  First of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it.
[04:36:31.278 --> 04:36:31.678]  Everything.
[04:36:32.159 --> 04:36:36.482]  Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment.
[04:36:36.822 --> 04:36:38.584]  This is a perfect example of it.
[04:36:38.624 --> 04:36:42.387]  Trying to save Obamacare, which is... You've said you want to end Obamacare.
[04:36:42.467 --> 04:36:43.948]  You've said you want to end Obamacare.
[04:36:43.988 --> 04:36:48.091]  You've also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions.
[04:36:48.151 --> 04:36:52.815]  How do you force insurance companies to do that if you're no longer mandating that every person get insurance?
[04:36:52.835 --> 04:36:53.875]  You're going to have plans.
[04:36:53.895 --> 04:36:54.476]  What does that mean?
[04:36:54.676 --> 04:36:55.917]  Well, I'll tell you what it means.
[04:36:56.277 --> 04:37:06.063]  You're going to have plans that are so good because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come.
[04:37:06.684 --> 04:37:09.726]  Are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?
[04:37:11.627 --> 04:37:14.888]  By keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state.
[04:37:15.168 --> 04:37:20.450]  And it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare.
[04:37:21.310 --> 04:37:22.530]  Which, by the way, was a fraud.
[04:37:22.650 --> 04:37:23.130]  You know that.
[04:37:23.210 --> 04:37:29.252]  Because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said, he said it was a great lie.
[04:37:29.272 --> 04:37:29.973]  It was a big lie.
[04:37:30.213 --> 04:37:32.373]  President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plant.
[04:37:32.393 --> 04:37:33.494]  The whole thing was a fraud.
[04:37:33.814 --> 04:37:34.474]  And it doesn't work.
[04:37:35.134 --> 04:37:40.176]  But when we get rid of those lines, you have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing.
[04:37:40.496 --> 04:37:46.358]  We'll also be able to help people that can't get, don't have money, because we are going to have people protected.
[04:37:46.798 --> 04:37:50.540]  And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way.
[04:37:50.880 --> 04:37:53.481]  We're going to block grant into the states.
[04:37:53.621 --> 04:38:02.244]  We're going to block grant into Medicaid, into the states, so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.
[04:38:03.166 --> 04:38:07.107]  We now go to Gorba Hamid with a question for both candidates.
[04:38:08.808 --> 04:38:09.028]  Hi.
[04:38:09.728 --> 04:38:13.249]  There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I'm one of them.
[04:38:14.089 --> 04:38:25.573]  You've mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?
[04:38:26.173 --> 04:38:27.694]  Mr. Trump, you're first.
[04:38:28.407 --> 04:38:31.589]  Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame.
[04:38:32.590 --> 04:38:36.012]  But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that
[04:38:37.162 --> 04:38:38.122]  Because there is a problem.
[04:38:38.603 --> 04:38:44.425]  I mean, whether we like it or not, and we can be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.
[04:38:45.085 --> 04:38:50.688]  And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.
[04:38:50.908 --> 04:38:52.848]  When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.
[04:38:52.908 --> 04:39:01.032]  As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.
[04:39:01.472 --> 04:39:03.153]  Horribly wounded, they'll never be the same.
[04:39:04.453 --> 04:39:05.874]  Muslims have to report.
[04:39:07.386 --> 04:39:08.806]  The problems when they see them.
[04:39:09.866 --> 04:39:13.527]  And there's always a reason for everything.
[04:39:14.047 --> 04:39:18.068]  If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country.
[04:39:18.728 --> 04:39:28.970]  Because you look at Orlando, and you look at San Bernardino, and you look at the World Trade Center, go outside, you look at Paris, look at that horrible, these are radical Islamic terrorists.
[04:39:29.910 --> 04:39:33.950]  And he won't even mention the word, and nor will President Obama.
[04:39:34.011 --> 04:39:36.251]  He won't use the term radical Islamic
[04:39:37.091 --> 04:39:37.451]  Terrorism.
[04:39:37.692 --> 04:39:43.776]  Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is, or at least say the name.
[04:39:44.837 --> 04:39:49.360]  She won't say the name, and President Obama won't say the name, but the name is there.
[04:39:49.801 --> 04:39:51.982]  It's radical Islamic terror.
[04:39:52.423 --> 04:39:54.884]  And before you solve it, you have to say the name.
[04:39:56.145 --> 04:39:56.926]  Secretary Clinton.
[04:39:58.007 --> 04:40:00.028]  Well, thank you for asking your question.
[04:40:00.068 --> 04:40:04.672]  And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim Americans across our country.
[04:40:05.680 --> 04:40:14.423]  Because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims.
[04:40:14.883 --> 04:40:25.426]  And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.
[04:40:25.446 --> 04:40:27.807]  I want to say just a couple of things.
[04:40:27.887 --> 04:40:30.908]  First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.
[04:40:32.236 --> 04:40:34.597]  And we've had many successful Muslims.
[04:40:34.998 --> 04:40:39.220]  We just lost a particularly well-known one with Muhammad Ali.
[04:40:42.101 --> 04:40:47.104]  My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place.
[04:40:47.664 --> 04:40:54.908]  If you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community, that's what America is.
[04:40:54.928 --> 04:40:57.650]  That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.
[04:40:59.079 --> 04:41:06.641]  It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.
[04:41:07.679 --> 04:41:12.662]  We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears, on our front lines.
[04:41:13.342 --> 04:41:16.945]  I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.
[04:41:17.345 --> 04:41:29.872]  I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see.
[04:41:29.892 --> 04:41:31.773]  They're letting the radical Muslims in.
[04:41:32.254 --> 04:41:34.055]  She has said she wants war with Russia.
[04:41:34.335 --> 04:41:38.497]  To do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.
[04:41:38.637 --> 04:41:45.440]  Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Dalek says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans?
[04:41:45.460 --> 04:41:47.441]  And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists.
[04:41:49.602 --> 04:41:51.444]  Violent, jihadist terrorists.
[04:41:51.464 --> 04:41:54.687]  He said because you're trying to leave with Brexit, we will attack you.
[04:41:54.707 --> 04:41:55.108]  It's a quote.
[04:41:55.248 --> 04:41:56.309]  And it is a mistake.
[04:41:56.349 --> 04:41:57.210]  You want to leave with Brexit?
[04:41:57.230 --> 04:41:58.231]  You want to leave with the EU?
[04:41:58.251 --> 04:42:00.934]  We'll hit you harder than you've ever been hit before.
[04:42:00.954 --> 04:42:04.077]  So I want a country where citizens like you
[04:42:04.998 --> 04:42:07.178]  And your family are just as welcome as anyone else.
[04:42:07.238 --> 04:42:08.599]  She represents banks that seized America.
[04:42:08.619 --> 04:42:10.079]  She's a foreign collaborator.
[04:42:10.099 --> 04:42:11.819]  Mr. Trump, in December, you said this.
[04:42:12.479 --> 04:42:21.121]  Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
[04:42:21.201 --> 04:42:22.441]  Because they're not doing any vetting.
[04:42:22.481 --> 04:42:23.262]  They're not doing any vetting.
[04:42:23.282 --> 04:42:24.182]  We have no choice.
[04:42:24.282 --> 04:42:26.002]  I can't get back to him without a passport.
[04:42:26.062 --> 04:42:26.682]  You're running late.
[04:42:26.702 --> 04:42:28.183]  You can't go to Mexico without a passport.
[04:42:28.203 --> 04:42:30.163]  The Muslim ban is no longer in your position.
[04:42:30.183 --> 04:42:30.523]  This is crazy!
[04:42:30.723 --> 04:42:31.763]  Is that correct?
[04:42:31.843 --> 04:42:33.444]  All he said was, put it back in!
[04:42:33.504 --> 04:42:35.945]  Was it a mistake to have a religious test?
[04:42:36.185 --> 04:42:39.226]  First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero.
[04:42:40.087 --> 04:42:43.408]  And if I were president at that time, he would be alive today.
[04:42:44.656 --> 04:42:52.799]  Because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.
[04:42:52.859 --> 04:42:54.239]  Iraq was a disaster.
[04:42:54.600 --> 04:42:55.220]  He was on record.
[04:42:55.240 --> 04:42:56.380]  He would have been alive today.
[04:42:56.820 --> 04:42:57.701]  On record six times.
[04:42:57.821 --> 04:43:06.424]  The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.
[04:43:06.464 --> 04:43:08.965]  Hillary Clinton wants to allow
[04:43:10.198 --> 04:43:12.740]  And why did it morph into that?
[04:43:12.801 --> 04:43:13.901]  No, answer the question.
[04:43:13.982 --> 04:43:15.183]  Why do you interrupt her?
[04:43:15.503 --> 04:43:16.684]  You interrupt me all the time.
[04:43:16.704 --> 04:43:17.465]  Why don't you interrupt her?
[04:43:17.485 --> 04:43:21.848]  Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?
[04:43:21.928 --> 04:43:24.751]  It's called extreme vetting.
[04:43:25.271 --> 04:43:32.838]  We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.
[04:43:32.858 --> 04:43:33.558]  They're not even vetting.
[04:43:33.578 --> 04:43:35.800]  And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a five
[04:43:38.161 --> 04:43:39.822]  150% increase over Obama.
[04:43:40.442 --> 04:43:48.983]  People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they're from, what their feelings about our country is.
[04:43:49.463 --> 04:43:51.023]  And she wants 550% more.
[04:43:51.143 --> 04:43:54.464]  This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.
[04:43:55.384 --> 04:43:57.064]  We have enough problems in this country.
[04:43:57.224 --> 04:43:58.945]  I believe in building safe zones.
[04:43:59.405 --> 04:44:01.445]  I believe in having other people pay for them.
[04:44:01.605 --> 04:44:05.566]  As an example, the Gulf states who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money.
[04:44:06.346 --> 04:44:08.529]  Saudi Arabia hasn't taken one Syrian refugee.
[04:44:08.589 --> 04:44:09.310]  Great point.
[04:44:09.330 --> 04:44:22.806]  With all the problems this country has, and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them, we know nothing about their values, and we know nothing about their love for our country.
[04:44:23.482 --> 04:44:25.883]  And Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that.
[04:44:26.344 --> 04:44:32.507]  Because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees.
[04:44:32.947 --> 04:44:35.068]  We know you want tougher vetting.
[04:44:35.369 --> 04:44:37.069]  That's not a perfect system.
[04:44:37.089 --> 04:44:39.631]  But I shot a video on top of that mountain top in Sawyer State.
[04:44:39.671 --> 04:44:41.692]  It was basically all Muslims up there.
[04:44:41.732 --> 04:44:46.975]  First of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us
[04:44:48.114 --> 04:44:50.016]  But there are a lot of refugees.
[04:44:50.036 --> 04:44:51.217]  Oh, there are a lot of nice Muslims.
[04:44:51.257 --> 04:44:52.097]  Women and children.
[04:44:52.137 --> 04:44:59.864]  Think of that picture we all saw of that four-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian Syrian air forces.
[04:44:59.904 --> 04:45:02.266]  You and Obama launched the Syria war on record!
[04:45:02.606 --> 04:45:04.928]  You started it and now you're blaming Trump!
[04:45:05.028 --> 04:45:07.029]  In this catastrophic war.
[04:45:07.970 --> 04:45:11.252]  Largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression.
[04:45:11.492 --> 04:45:13.172]  Russia wanted to stop the jihadis, you damn liar!
[04:45:13.212 --> 04:45:14.093]  And we need to do our part.
[04:45:14.113 --> 04:45:14.873]  She thinks you're dumb, folks.
[04:45:14.893 --> 04:45:19.715]  We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.
[04:45:20.676 --> 04:45:29.780]  But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.
[04:45:30.721 --> 04:45:33.162]  But it is important for us as a
[04:45:34.485 --> 04:45:41.071]  Policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.
[04:45:42.172 --> 04:45:42.993]  How do you do that?
[04:45:43.013 --> 04:45:46.636]  He said, until you start vetting, shut it all down.
[04:45:47.557 --> 04:45:55.804]  How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own country?
[04:45:55.824 --> 04:45:58.066]  Are we going to have religious tests?
[04:45:58.887 --> 04:46:00.388]  When people fly into our country,
[04:46:01.314 --> 04:46:05.558]  And how do we expect to be able to implement those?
[04:46:06.079 --> 04:46:23.877]  I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous and indeed you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorist sites and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit
[04:46:25.197 --> 04:46:25.638]  Fighters.
[04:46:26.219 --> 04:46:34.014]  You allowed the recruiting, you ran it, it was your invasion, your Arab Spring, Al Gore called for an Arab Spring here, you are a damn liar!
[04:46:37.446 --> 04:46:38.407]  We have it on tape.
[04:46:38.567 --> 04:46:41.049]  The entire press corps has looked at it.
[04:46:41.269 --> 04:46:42.310]  It's been debunked.
[04:46:42.390 --> 04:46:46.152]  It never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.
[04:46:46.232 --> 04:46:49.755]  He wrote a book!
[04:46:49.815 --> 04:46:51.676]  I was against the war in Iraq.
[04:46:51.696 --> 04:46:52.797]  It has not been debunked.
[04:46:53.497 --> 04:46:55.579]  And you voted for it and you shouldn't have.
[04:46:55.679 --> 04:46:57.640]  There's been lots of fact-checking on that.
[04:46:57.740 --> 04:46:59.802]  I'd like to answer an online question.
[04:46:59.822 --> 04:47:02.444]  She just went about 25 seconds over her time.
[04:47:02.464 --> 04:47:04.045]  Could I just respond to this please?
[04:47:04.185 --> 04:47:05.106]  Very quickly please.
[04:47:05.848 --> 04:47:11.876]  Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens.
[04:47:12.357 --> 04:47:16.323]  When we want to send them back to their country, their country says, we don't want them.
[04:47:16.503 --> 04:47:21.009]  In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems, and they don't want them.
[04:47:21.890 --> 04:47:26.032]  Hillary Clinton, when she was Secretary of State, said, that's okay, we can't force it into their country.
[04:47:26.072 --> 04:47:28.894]  Let me tell you, I'm gonna force them right back into their country.
[04:47:29.174 --> 04:47:31.335]  They're murderers and some very bad people.
[04:47:31.755 --> 04:47:37.438]  And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment.
[04:47:37.498 --> 04:47:43.041]  Because we are letting people into this country that are gonna cause problems and crime like you've never seen.
[04:47:43.381 --> 04:47:47.543]  We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip.
[04:47:48.263 --> 04:47:48.824]  We're good to go.
[04:48:10.447 --> 04:48:12.028]  It's a horrible thing she's doing.
[04:48:12.268 --> 04:48:18.589]  She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad, that she should never be President of the United States.
[04:48:18.629 --> 04:48:20.010]  That I can tell you.
[04:48:20.170 --> 04:48:21.030]  I want to move on.
[04:48:21.070 --> 04:48:23.171]  This next question comes from the public.
[04:48:23.191 --> 04:48:24.411]  I'm going to put the headline out.
[04:48:24.451 --> 04:48:27.492]  Fox News, but we have seven, six clips.
[04:48:27.692 --> 04:48:29.733]  2003 clip backs Trump on war opposition.
[04:48:29.753 --> 04:48:30.673]  He says we shouldn't do it.
[04:48:30.733 --> 04:48:31.353]  Bush is wrong.
[04:48:31.853 --> 04:48:33.894]  A month before they did it, we have five other clips.
[04:48:34.014 --> 04:48:34.534]  Six clips.
[04:48:35.074 --> 04:48:36.415]  For TV viewers, there it is.
[04:48:36.816 --> 04:48:38.577]  Clip backs Trump on Iraq war.
[04:48:38.597 --> 04:48:39.538]  I played it 50 times.
[04:48:39.899 --> 04:48:41.020]  She is a liar.
[04:48:41.580 --> 04:48:42.401]  Let's go back to it.
[04:48:42.481 --> 04:48:49.828]  Secretary Clinton purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues.
[04:48:50.288 --> 04:48:56.933]  So, two from Virginia asks, is it okay for politicians to be two-faced?
[04:48:57.153 --> 04:49:01.876]  Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues?
[04:49:02.237 --> 04:49:04.458]  Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.
[04:49:04.598 --> 04:49:04.818]  Right.
[04:49:04.959 --> 04:49:17.147]  As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called Lincoln.
[04:49:18.308 --> 04:49:26.173]  It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment.
[04:49:27.113 --> 04:49:29.535]  It was principled and it was strategic.
[04:49:30.475 --> 04:49:33.177]  And I was making the point that
[04:49:33.397 --> 04:49:34.258]  No, that's not lying.
[04:49:34.318 --> 04:49:35.338]  You lie constantly.
[04:49:55.319 --> 04:50:10.866]  But you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing
[04:50:11.926 --> 04:50:18.034]  The attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election.
[04:50:18.574 --> 04:50:28.927]  And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.
[04:50:29.748 --> 04:50:41.593]  We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election.
[04:50:42.094 --> 04:50:44.975]  And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected.
[04:50:45.195 --> 04:50:49.117]  They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.
[04:50:49.157 --> 04:50:51.278]  Now maybe because he has praise for Hillary.
[04:50:51.858 --> 04:50:55.541]  Nigel Farage is helping Trump, he's not a British agent.
[04:50:55.622 --> 04:50:58.824]  Maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons.
[04:50:59.465 --> 04:51:00.806]  But we deserve answers.
[04:51:01.627 --> 04:51:12.857]  And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial risks that he has.
[04:51:12.997 --> 04:51:14.358]  Talk about selling us out, lady.
[04:51:14.418 --> 04:51:17.922]  I mean, you are the biggest criminal ever, because it's so ridiculous.
[04:51:18.942 --> 04:51:22.625]  Look, now she's blaming, she got caught in a total lie.
[04:51:23.325 --> 04:51:27.028]  Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else.
[04:51:27.708 --> 04:51:30.630]  And she said things, WikiLeaks, that just came out.
[04:51:31.731 --> 04:51:32.892]  And she lied.
[04:51:33.152 --> 04:51:37.335]  Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.
[04:51:37.535 --> 04:51:38.556]  That's one that I have.
[04:51:40.146 --> 04:51:41.126]  Okay, honest Abe.
[04:51:41.246 --> 04:51:42.267]  Honest Abe never lied.
[04:51:42.287 --> 04:51:42.947]  That's the good thing.
[04:51:42.987 --> 04:51:45.448]  That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.
[04:51:46.548 --> 04:51:47.969]  That's a big, big difference.
[04:51:47.989 --> 04:51:49.530]  We're talking about some difference.
[04:51:50.490 --> 04:51:55.872]  But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know, Putin.
[04:51:56.789 --> 04:52:02.397]  I think it would be great if we got along with Russia, because we could fight ISIS together as an example, but I don't know Putin.
[04:52:03.077 --> 04:52:09.506]  But I notice anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say, the Russians, she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking.
[04:52:09.927 --> 04:52:10.988]  Maybe there is no hacking.
[04:52:11.749 --> 04:52:12.629]  But they always blame Russia.
[04:52:12.770 --> 04:52:16.371]  And the reason they blame Russia, because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.
[04:52:16.872 --> 04:52:18.132]  I know nothing about Russia.
[04:52:18.553 --> 04:52:22.355]  I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia.
[04:52:22.395 --> 04:52:22.975]  I don't deal there.
[04:52:23.035 --> 04:52:24.015]  I have no businesses there.
[04:52:24.035 --> 04:52:25.456]  I have no loans from Russia.
[04:52:25.476 --> 04:52:27.978]  I have a very, very great balance sheet.
[04:52:28.058 --> 04:52:35.702]  So great that when I did the old post office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well,
[04:52:36.602 --> 04:52:41.525]  Chose me to do the old post office between the White House and Congress.
[04:52:42.025 --> 04:52:44.026]  Chose me to do the old post office.
[04:52:44.086 --> 04:52:47.709]  One of the primary things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.
[04:52:48.649 --> 04:52:50.950]  But I have no loans with Russia.
[04:52:50.990 --> 04:52:59.395]  You could go to the United States government and they would probably tell you that because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.
[04:52:59.736 --> 04:53:01.577]  Now, the taxes are a very simple thing.
[04:53:02.057 --> 04:53:05.259]  As soon as I have, first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.
[04:53:06.365 --> 04:53:09.027]  Many of her friends took bigger deductions.
[04:53:09.047 --> 04:53:11.710]  Warren Buffett took a massive deduction.
[04:53:12.270 --> 04:53:14.872]  Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction.
[04:53:15.132 --> 04:53:21.418]  Many of the people that are giving her all this money, that she can do many more commercials than me, took massive deductions.
[04:53:22.178 --> 04:53:29.164]  I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes, but as soon as my routine audit's finished, I'll release my returns.
[04:53:29.224 --> 04:53:30.045]  I'll be very proud to.
[04:53:30.325 --> 04:53:31.305]  Thank you, Mr. Trump.
[04:53:31.665 --> 04:53:34.086]  We're on turn, actually, to the topic of taxes.
[04:53:34.106 --> 04:53:35.587]  We have a question from Spencer Moth.
[04:53:35.627 --> 04:53:36.287]  Bravo, Trump!
[04:53:36.367 --> 04:53:38.608]  Spencer?
[04:53:38.648 --> 04:53:39.648]  I'm going to sleep so good tonight.
[04:53:39.728 --> 04:53:40.448]  Wow, this is great.
[04:53:41.368 --> 04:53:41.788]  Good evening.
[04:53:42.669 --> 04:53:49.111]  My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?
[04:53:49.631 --> 04:53:50.691]  Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.
[04:53:50.771 --> 04:53:53.192]  Well, one thing I do is get rid of carried interest.
[04:53:53.852 --> 04:53:56.953]  One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you.
[04:53:57.873 --> 04:53:59.274]  I give up a lot when I run because
[04:54:00.194 --> 04:54:01.335]  I knock out the tax code.
[04:54:02.055 --> 04:54:03.575]  And she could have done this years ago, by the way.
[04:54:03.595 --> 04:54:05.936]  She's a United States, she was a United States Senator.
[04:54:06.517 --> 04:54:09.478]  She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code.
[04:54:09.578 --> 04:54:11.219]  Well, why didn't she change it?
[04:54:11.259 --> 04:54:13.420]  Why didn't you change it when you were Senator?
[04:54:13.440 --> 04:54:16.041]  The reason you didn't is that all your friends took the same advantage.
[04:54:16.101 --> 04:54:20.202]  You have provisions in the tax code that frankly we could change.
[04:54:20.963 --> 04:54:27.025]  But you wouldn't change it because all of these people give you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.
[04:54:27.065 --> 04:54:28.126]  That's right, foreign bankers.
[04:54:28.846 --> 04:54:30.107]  And I say that about a lot of things.
[04:54:30.127 --> 04:54:33.769]  You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years.
[04:54:33.849 --> 04:54:34.709]  Oh, we should have done this.
[04:54:35.009 --> 04:54:36.250]  But she's been there for 30 years.
[04:54:36.270 --> 04:54:37.171]  She's been doing this stuff.
[04:54:37.731 --> 04:54:38.371]  She never changed.
[04:54:38.451 --> 04:54:39.752]  And she never will change.
[04:54:40.192 --> 04:54:41.393]  She never will change.
[04:54:41.673 --> 04:54:43.414]  We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.
[04:54:43.954 --> 04:54:50.718]  I'm lowering taxes, actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving, massive corporations and little ones.
[04:54:51.398 --> 04:54:52.699]  Little ones can't form.
[04:54:52.719 --> 04:54:56.802]  We're getting rid of regulations, which goes hand-in-hand with the lowering of the taxes.
[04:54:56.842 --> 04:54:58.704]  But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35% to 15%.
[04:54:58.964 --> 04:55:02.767]  We're cutting taxes for the middle class.
[04:55:03.127 --> 04:55:06.590]  And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.
[04:55:07.111 --> 04:55:10.874]  And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks.
[04:55:10.894 --> 04:55:13.395]  She's raising your taxes really high.
[04:55:14.236 --> 04:55:21.238]  And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country.
[04:55:21.758 --> 04:55:23.218]  That in itself is a big difference.
[04:55:23.318 --> 04:55:24.858]  We are going to be thriving again.
[04:55:25.279 --> 04:55:27.099]  We have no growth in this country.
[04:55:27.159 --> 04:55:27.799]  There's no growth.
[04:55:28.279 --> 04:55:33.520]  If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe.
[04:55:34.081 --> 04:55:35.301]  We're down to 1 percent.
[04:55:36.321 --> 04:55:38.302]  And that's like, no growth.
[04:55:38.602 --> 04:55:40.703]  And we're going lower, in my opinion.
[04:55:40.723 --> 04:55:43.444]  And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high.
[04:55:43.684 --> 04:55:45.385]  Just about the highest in the world.
[04:55:46.005 --> 04:55:49.027]  And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.
[04:55:49.227 --> 04:55:52.748]  And I think it's so important, one of the most important things we can do.
[04:55:52.989 --> 04:55:55.710]  But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.
[04:55:56.130 --> 04:55:57.311]  Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.
[04:55:57.331 --> 04:56:02.453]  The question was, what specific tax provisions would the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?
[04:56:03.902 --> 04:56:07.103]  Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true.
[04:56:07.323 --> 04:56:12.205]  I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.
[04:56:12.825 --> 04:56:21.209]  And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do, but I'll tell you what he's going to do.
[04:56:22.049 --> 04:56:28.716]  His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had.
[04:56:29.216 --> 04:56:32.580]  More than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.
[04:56:32.600 --> 04:56:36.403]  Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald.
[04:56:36.543 --> 04:56:38.786]  And this would be a massive gift.
[04:56:39.651 --> 04:56:46.816]  And indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle class families.
[04:56:46.936 --> 04:56:48.617]  Millions of middle class families.
[04:56:49.098 --> 04:56:50.118]  Now here's what I want to do.
[04:56:50.799 --> 04:56:59.324]  I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year, and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know, will have their taxes raised.
[04:56:59.405 --> 04:57:04.288]  Because I think we've got to go where the money is, and the money is with people who've taken advantage.
[04:57:04.628 --> 04:57:07.052]  Every single break in the tax code.
[04:57:07.092 --> 04:57:09.255]  And yes, when I was senator, I did vote to close corporate defaults.
[04:57:09.275 --> 04:57:10.898]  I voted to close corporate defaults.
[04:57:13.197 --> 04:57:19.979]  I think one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.
[04:57:20.719 --> 04:57:26.521]  I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.
[04:57:26.621 --> 04:57:27.782]  It's called the Buffett Rule.
[04:57:28.002 --> 04:57:33.063]  Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said, somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary.
[04:57:33.083 --> 04:57:34.324]  Because he wants your tax money as a middle class.
[04:57:34.364 --> 04:57:35.124]  He has stuff set up for us.
[04:57:35.144 --> 04:57:37.125]  I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 billion.
[04:57:37.145 --> 04:57:37.525]  He's scamming you.
[04:57:37.545 --> 04:57:38.665]  He's the biggest beneficiary of the Bank of Maryland.
[04:57:38.685 --> 04:57:39.665]  We have to make up for lost time.
[04:57:39.685 --> 04:57:41.546]  Google, Warren Buffett, biggest beneficiary of the Bank of Maryland.
[04:57:41.786 --> 04:57:42.466]  Put it up!
[04:57:42.506 --> 04:57:43.707]  Put it up!
[04:57:43.747 --> 04:57:45.848]  He got hundreds of billions of your money!
[04:57:46.409 --> 04:57:47.950]  That's why he wants higher taxes!
[04:57:48.090 --> 04:57:48.650]  Put it up!
[04:57:49.211 --> 04:57:50.651]  McClatchy!
[04:57:50.751 --> 04:57:52.953]  Warren Buffett, Vegas recipient of LL.
[04:57:53.173 --> 04:57:54.434]  You're a lying whore!
[04:57:55.256 --> 04:58:02.703]  People like Donald who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education.
[04:58:03.323 --> 04:58:04.284]  That is wrong.
[04:58:04.645 --> 04:58:12.732]  And we're going to make sure that nobody, no corporation and no individual, can get away without paying his fair share.
[04:58:14.013 --> 04:58:15.853]  Mr. Trump, I want to give the chance to respond.
[04:58:15.893 --> 04:58:17.714]  I just want to tell our viewers what she's referring to.
[04:58:17.734 --> 04:58:21.854]  In the last month, taxes were the number one issue on Facebook for the first time in campaign.
[04:58:21.874 --> 04:58:32.316]  The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax return that show you claimed a $960 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years.
[04:58:32.596 --> 04:58:36.717]  You said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes.
[04:58:36.737 --> 04:58:38.637]  You have not answered, though, a simple question.
[04:58:39.037 --> 04:58:43.458]  Did you use that $960 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for
[04:58:43.658 --> 04:58:44.398]  Of course I do.
[04:58:44.878 --> 04:58:45.438]  Of course I do.
[04:58:45.458 --> 04:58:45.979]  I love the honesty.
[04:58:46.059 --> 04:58:48.599]  And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.
[04:58:48.699 --> 04:58:49.800]  I know many of her donors.
[04:58:50.520 --> 04:58:52.860]  Her donors took massive tax breaks.
[04:58:52.880 --> 04:58:54.141]  They wrote it!
[04:58:54.161 --> 04:58:54.681]  They wrote it!
[04:58:54.701 --> 04:58:58.982]  A lot of my write-off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.
[04:58:59.302 --> 04:59:00.282]  He chose America though.
[04:59:00.322 --> 04:59:02.643]  Because the people that give her all this money, they want it.
[04:59:03.283 --> 04:59:03.723]  That's why.
[04:59:03.743 --> 04:59:07.506]  See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.
[04:59:07.966 --> 04:59:23.438]  Hillary Clinton, and it's extremely complex, Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people, but they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving.
[04:59:24.018 --> 04:59:29.142]  It's very interesting why she's leaving carried interest, but I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous
[04:59:29.782 --> 04:59:30.523]  To be in America.
[04:59:50.180 --> 04:59:52.982]  No, but I pay tax and I pay federal tax, too.
[04:59:53.563 --> 04:59:54.543]  But I have a write-off.
[04:59:54.583 --> 04:59:57.025]  A lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.
[04:59:57.085 --> 04:59:57.646]  I love depreciation.
[04:59:57.666 --> 04:59:58.987]  The rich guys wrote it when you can't operate a zone.
[04:59:59.007 --> 04:59:59.707]  No, she's given it to us.
[05:00:00.027 --> 05:00:03.910]  Hey, if she had a problem... For 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson.
[05:00:03.950 --> 05:00:04.671]  I say it all the time.
[05:00:04.691 --> 05:00:05.031]  She does it!
[05:00:05.051 --> 05:00:05.351]  She does it!
[05:00:05.371 --> 05:00:06.132]  She talks about healthcare.
[05:00:06.212 --> 05:00:07.393]  Why didn't she do something about it?
[05:00:07.653 --> 05:00:08.514]  She talks about taxes.
[05:00:08.974 --> 05:00:10.395]  Why didn't she do something about it?
[05:00:11.235 --> 05:00:14.797]  He doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.
[05:00:14.877 --> 05:00:18.339]  With her, it's all talk and no action.
[05:00:18.399 --> 05:00:22.061]  And again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.
[05:00:22.241 --> 05:00:25.043]  She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.
[05:00:30.646 --> 05:00:39.091]  I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place.
[05:00:39.371 --> 05:00:44.494]  They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.
[05:00:44.834 --> 05:00:45.755]  Congratulations.
[05:00:45.875 --> 05:00:46.375]  Great job.
[05:00:46.475 --> 05:00:47.996]  Won't you be able to respond, Secretary Clinton?
[05:00:49.468 --> 05:00:50.990]  Let's not hear her BS response.
[05:00:51.030 --> 05:00:56.337]  Let's play her from six months ago saying she wants to go after the middle class.
[05:00:56.897 --> 05:00:58.159]  Let's hear it from Hillary.
[05:00:58.459 --> 05:00:59.741]  Let's hear it from Hillary.
[05:00:59.761 --> 05:01:02.244]  Believe her the first time, like Maya Angelou said.
[05:01:02.284 --> 05:01:03.886]  Yeah, let's back it up.
[05:01:03.906 --> 05:01:06.109]  Let's play it one more time.
[05:01:06.369 --> 05:01:07.470]  Let's hear it from Hillary.
[05:01:07.490 --> 05:01:08.352]  Let's believe her the first time.
[05:01:09.192 --> 05:01:11.113]  Well, we're not going there, my friends.
[05:01:11.933 --> 05:01:20.036]  I'm telling you right now, we're going to write fairer rules for the middle class and we are going to raise taxes on the middle class!
[05:01:20.076 --> 05:01:21.156]  Damn right you're going to shut it down.
[05:01:21.176 --> 05:01:21.996]  A little bit of improvement.
[05:01:22.016 --> 05:01:22.877]  She's having a hemorrhage.
[05:01:22.917 --> 05:01:24.177]  Let's go back to the liar, though.
[05:01:24.197 --> 05:01:24.797]  Repeatedly.
[05:01:24.817 --> 05:01:27.598]  30 years this and 30 years that.
[05:01:28.038 --> 05:01:30.999]  So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.
[05:01:31.079 --> 05:01:32.820]  I'm very glad to do so.
[05:01:34.434 --> 05:01:41.379]  Eight million kids every year have health insurance because when I was First Lady, I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.
[05:01:41.399 --> 05:01:42.240]  This country is in a depression by design.
[05:01:42.260 --> 05:01:45.363]  They want you poor to make you renters, put you in 200 square foot houses.
[05:01:45.423 --> 05:01:46.543]  It's all their austerity plan.
[05:01:46.563 --> 05:01:47.544]  It's shit you want.
[05:01:47.824 --> 05:01:54.289]  But notice in the clip, though, she's got Warren Buffett right behind her, who is the crime lord, like Carlos Slim.
[05:01:54.650 --> 05:01:57.932]  He's right there to the left of her, on screen, smiling.
[05:01:57.952 --> 05:01:59.794]  The guy is tax exempt, $100 billion.
[05:02:00.134 --> 05:02:01.495]  I'm not going there, my friends.
[05:02:02.375 --> 05:02:10.599]  I'm telling you right now, we're going to write fairer rules for the middle class, and we are going to raise taxes on the middle class.
[05:02:11.460 --> 05:02:14.021]  Buffett-Klebs, damn right, shut down that enemy.
[05:02:14.341 --> 05:02:15.982]  Nobody gets money but globalists.
[05:02:16.042 --> 05:02:18.243]  You're going to be poor, so we run your damn life.
[05:02:18.543 --> 05:02:19.344]  I'm a eugenicist.
[05:02:19.364 --> 05:02:20.204]  Heil Hitler!
[05:02:20.244 --> 05:02:21.725]  My name is Warren Buffett!
[05:02:21.905 --> 05:02:22.966]  Heil Hitler!
[05:02:23.086 --> 05:02:24.786]  The guy is a eugenics Nazi.
[05:02:24.826 --> 05:02:25.287]  Here it is.
[05:02:25.387 --> 05:02:29.229]  Advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had
[05:02:30.049 --> 05:02:37.851]  A decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.
[05:02:39.012 --> 05:02:46.434]  Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or co-sponsor when I was a senator for eight years.
[05:02:47.895 --> 05:02:54.937]  I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.
[05:02:55.990 --> 05:03:05.437]  And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.
[05:03:05.477 --> 05:03:06.798]  And I've proven that I can.
[05:03:07.219 --> 05:03:10.441]  And for 30 years, I've produced results for people.
[05:03:10.461 --> 05:03:11.962]  We're going to move on to Syria.
[05:03:11.982 --> 05:03:13.524]  Both of you have mentioned that.
[05:03:13.604 --> 05:03:14.584]  30 minutes left, folks.
[05:03:14.604 --> 05:03:15.125]  Get ready.
[05:03:15.165 --> 05:03:16.526]  Mr. Trump, we're going to go on.
[05:03:16.546 --> 05:03:17.487]  This is about the audience.
[05:03:17.507 --> 05:03:19.388]  Mr. Trump, we're going to move on.
[05:03:23.712 --> 05:03:37.887]  The heartbreaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Amran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an airstrike in Aleppo focused the world's attention on the force of the war in Syria with 136 million views on Facebook alone.
[05:03:42.191 --> 05:03:51.674]  There are much worse images coming out of the WEPO every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children.
[05:03:52.114 --> 05:03:58.655]  Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia.
[05:04:00.996 --> 05:04:03.338]  For their bombardment of Aleppo.
[05:04:03.358 --> 05:04:06.720]  So this next question comes from social media through Facebook.
[05:04:07.080 --> 05:04:14.826]  Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?
[05:04:15.226 --> 05:04:18.088]  Isn't it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S.
[05:04:18.369 --> 05:04:20.610]  waited too long before we helped?
[05:04:20.690 --> 05:04:23.953]  Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.
[05:04:23.973 --> 05:04:27.015]  Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.
[05:04:28.706 --> 05:04:43.032]  Every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime, Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo.
[05:04:43.865 --> 05:04:49.533]  Where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.
[05:04:50.034 --> 05:04:59.347]  And there is a determined effort by the Russian Air Force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the
[05:05:00.348 --> 05:05:04.110]  Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.
[05:05:04.991 --> 05:05:07.172]  Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.
[05:05:07.733 --> 05:05:10.674]  They're interested in keeping Assad in power.
[05:05:10.694 --> 05:05:18.119]  So I, when I was Secretary of State, advocated, and I advocate today, a no-fly zone and safe zones.
[05:05:18.599 --> 05:05:22.922]  We need some leverage with the Russians, because they're not going to come to the
[05:05:25.043 --> 05:05:25.783]  We're good to go.
[05:05:47.205 --> 05:05:50.868]  Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria.
[05:05:50.908 --> 05:05:52.349]  The aggressiveness of Russia.
[05:05:52.369 --> 05:05:57.113]  And they've also decided that they want to see you become President of the United States too, and it's not me.
[05:05:57.393 --> 05:05:59.235]  Overthrowing Ukraine, you said you want to attack them.
[05:05:59.275 --> 05:06:03.198]  I've stood up to Russia, I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as President.
[05:06:03.378 --> 05:06:04.379]  God, she has flies on her.
[05:06:04.719 --> 05:06:07.361]  Wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine.
[05:06:07.401 --> 05:06:09.062]  And I did, as Secretary of State.
[05:06:09.102 --> 05:06:11.664]  That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.
[05:06:12.124 --> 05:06:18.309]  That's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.
[05:06:18.569 --> 05:06:22.431]  So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.
[05:06:22.912 --> 05:06:28.676]  But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed.
[05:06:29.216 --> 05:06:32.337]  By the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.
[05:06:32.357 --> 05:06:34.518]  Thank you, Secretary Clinton.
[05:06:34.538 --> 05:06:39.299]  Secretary of State with the so-called line in the sand, which... No, I wasn't.
[05:06:39.339 --> 05:06:39.799]  I was gone.
[05:06:39.839 --> 05:06:45.381]  I hate to interrupt you, but... But you were in contact, excuse me, you were in total contact with the White House.
[05:06:46.021 --> 05:06:49.602]  And perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.
[05:06:49.622 --> 05:06:51.643]  I don't think he'd be listening very much anymore.
[05:06:52.623 --> 05:06:54.183]  Obama draws the line in the sand.
[05:06:54.684 --> 05:06:55.024]  It was...
[05:06:56.394 --> 05:06:58.216]  Laughed at all over the world what happened.
[05:06:58.236 --> 05:07:02.199]  Now with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.
[05:07:03.100 --> 05:07:09.266]  But our nuclear program has fallen way behind and they've gone wild with their nuclear program.
[05:07:09.446 --> 05:07:09.886]  Not good.
[05:07:10.427 --> 05:07:12.088]  Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.
[05:07:12.589 --> 05:07:15.932]  Russia is new in terms of nuclear.
[05:07:16.372 --> 05:07:19.695]  We are old, we're tired, we're exhausted in terms of nuclear.
[05:07:20.851 --> 05:07:21.592]  A very bad thing.
[05:07:21.612 --> 05:07:22.453]  Now, she talks tough.
[05:07:22.613 --> 05:07:25.997]  She talks really tough against Putin.
[05:07:26.958 --> 05:07:28.579]  Yes, top generals advising him, by the way.
[05:07:28.599 --> 05:07:29.901]  She talks in favor of the rebels.
[05:07:29.921 --> 05:07:31.342]  She doesn't know who the rebels are.
[05:07:31.362 --> 05:07:38.470]  Every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people.
[05:07:39.030 --> 05:07:39.791]  And you know what happens?
[05:07:40.672 --> 05:07:42.072]  They end up being worse than the people.
[05:07:42.132 --> 05:07:44.233]  Look at what she did in Libya with Qaddafi.
[05:07:44.873 --> 05:07:45.653]  Qaddafi's out.
[05:07:45.873 --> 05:07:46.633]  It's a mess.
[05:07:47.014 --> 05:07:49.314]  And by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.
[05:07:49.394 --> 05:07:50.974]  I'm sure you probably have heard that.
[05:07:51.535 --> 05:07:52.455]  It was a disaster.
[05:07:52.795 --> 05:07:57.576]  Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.
[05:07:57.596 --> 05:07:58.976]  She admitted she wanted to fill state.
[05:07:59.096 --> 05:08:01.377]  But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia.
[05:08:02.097 --> 05:08:07.182]  And look at what they did this week, where I agree she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted.
[05:08:07.742 --> 05:08:08.983]  We sign a peace treaty.
[05:08:09.244 --> 05:08:10.265]  Everyone's all excited.
[05:08:10.825 --> 05:08:25.498]  Well, what Russia did with Assad, and by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of dealmaking, the Iran deal with $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough cash to fill up this room.
[05:08:26.399 --> 05:08:28.021]  But look at that deal.
[05:08:28.701 --> 05:08:31.363]  Iran now and Russia are now against us.
[05:08:31.863 --> 05:08:33.023]  So she wants to fight.
[05:08:33.544 --> 05:08:34.984]  She wants to fight for rebels.
[05:08:35.004 --> 05:08:36.165]  There's only one problem.
[05:08:36.205 --> 05:08:37.666]  You don't even know who the rebels are.
[05:08:37.706 --> 05:08:38.326]  Mr. Trump.
[05:08:38.426 --> 05:08:39.627]  So what's your purpose?
[05:08:39.667 --> 05:08:42.949]  And one thing I have to say, I don't like Assad at all.
[05:08:43.289 --> 05:08:45.650]  But Assad is killing ISIS.
[05:08:46.070 --> 05:08:48.011]  Russia is killing ISIS.
[05:08:48.372 --> 05:08:50.433]  And Iran is killing ISIS.
[05:08:50.513 --> 05:08:54.515]  And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.
[05:08:54.535 --> 05:08:55.596]  We always had the high ground.
[05:08:55.616 --> 05:08:56.176]  We gave it up!
[05:08:56.196 --> 05:08:57.757]  Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question.
[05:08:58.397 --> 05:09:05.762]  If you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?
[05:09:05.862 --> 05:09:09.044]  And I want to remind you what your running mate said.
[05:09:09.104 --> 05:09:27.537]  He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in airstrikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.
[05:09:28.437 --> 05:09:30.158]  He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree.
[05:09:30.718 --> 05:09:31.258]  I disagree.
[05:09:31.578 --> 05:09:33.078]  I think we have to knock out ISIS.
[05:09:33.719 --> 05:09:36.119]  Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.
[05:09:36.820 --> 05:09:38.920]  We have people that want to fight both at the same time.
[05:09:39.300 --> 05:09:40.701]  But Syria is no longer Syria.
[05:09:40.761 --> 05:09:49.103]  Syria is Russia, and it's Iran, who she made strong, and Kerry, and Obama, made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation very, very quickly.
[05:09:49.123 --> 05:09:49.944]  I believe we have to get
[05:09:54.938 --> 05:09:55.198]  ISIS.
[05:09:55.598 --> 05:10:00.140]  We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.
[05:10:00.160 --> 05:10:02.000]  She had a chance to do something with Syria.
[05:10:02.040 --> 05:10:02.720]  They had a chance.
[05:10:02.961 --> 05:10:04.061]  And that was the line.
[05:10:04.081 --> 05:10:06.242]  What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?
[05:10:06.322 --> 05:10:09.403]  I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian disaster.
[05:10:10.903 --> 05:10:13.745]  I think that it basically has fallen, okay?
[05:10:14.105 --> 05:10:14.926]  It basically has fallen.
[05:10:15.126 --> 05:10:15.906]  Let me tell you something.
[05:10:15.946 --> 05:10:16.967]  You take a look at Mosul.
[05:10:17.127 --> 05:10:21.130]  The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy.
[05:10:21.430 --> 05:10:22.070]  We have Mosul.
[05:10:22.090 --> 05:10:24.172]  They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.
[05:10:24.672 --> 05:10:27.654]  So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq.
[05:10:27.994 --> 05:10:30.816]  We will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.
[05:10:31.396 --> 05:10:35.079]  All of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.
[05:10:35.379 --> 05:10:37.261]  Why can't they do it quietly?
[05:10:37.521 --> 05:10:47.850]  Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success.
[05:10:48.531 --> 05:10:49.072]  People leave!
[05:10:49.672 --> 05:10:55.558]  Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying.
[05:10:55.598 --> 05:10:56.999]  How stupid is our country?
[05:10:57.219 --> 05:11:00.382]  There are sometimes reasons the military does that.
[05:11:00.762 --> 05:11:02.483]  Psychological warfare.
[05:11:02.744 --> 05:11:03.604]  I can't think of any.
[05:11:03.684 --> 05:11:06.306]  It might be to help get civilians out.
[05:11:06.627 --> 05:11:09.629]  Look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorse me.
[05:11:10.110 --> 05:11:14.693]  I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorse me.
[05:11:14.713 --> 05:11:16.895]  Yeah, you pretend to be a reporter, lady.
[05:11:17.175 --> 05:11:18.757]  You don't tell people where you're attacking.
[05:11:18.797 --> 05:11:23.440]  Why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock
[05:11:24.201 --> 05:11:24.802]  I don't know.
[05:11:42.455 --> 05:11:48.879]  Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.
[05:11:49.159 --> 05:11:53.342]  Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it.
[05:11:53.462 --> 05:12:03.088]  All I say is this, General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur, are spitting in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.
[05:12:03.208 --> 05:12:04.609]  I'm going to go to Secretary Clinton.
[05:12:04.649 --> 05:12:06.449]  Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go.
[05:12:06.489 --> 05:12:10.911]  You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo.
[05:12:11.251 --> 05:12:13.292]  You talk about diplomatic efforts.
[05:12:13.312 --> 05:12:14.233]  Those have failed.
[05:12:14.393 --> 05:12:15.893]  Ceasefires have failed.
[05:12:16.393 --> 05:12:18.734]  Would you introduce the threat of U.S.
[05:12:18.814 --> 05:12:24.817]  military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?
[05:12:25.615 --> 05:12:29.959]  I would not use American ground forces in Syria.
[05:12:30.300 --> 05:12:33.082]  I think that would be a very serious mistake.
[05:12:33.683 --> 05:12:41.871]  I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do, as an occupying force.
[05:12:42.091 --> 05:12:44.293]  I don't think that is a smart strategy.
[05:12:45.134 --> 05:12:56.660]  I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests.
[05:12:56.960 --> 05:13:02.382]  And so I do support what is happening, but... So what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?
[05:13:02.542 --> 05:13:05.424]  Martha, I hope that by the time I... Everything.
[05:13:06.144 --> 05:13:12.253]  I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.
[05:13:12.714 --> 05:13:16.739]  I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.
[05:13:18.001 --> 05:13:21.046]  Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.
[05:13:21.546 --> 05:13:22.247]  No, he doesn't.
[05:13:23.108 --> 05:13:38.844]  There are a lot of very important planning going on and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters that we all need to be in this and that takes a lot of planning and preparation.
[05:13:39.705 --> 05:13:41.306]  I would go after Baghdadi.
[05:13:41.466 --> 05:13:44.088]  I would specifically target Baghdadi.
[05:13:44.489 --> 05:13:53.275]  Because I think our targeting of Al Qaeda leaders, and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones, made a difference.
[05:13:53.395 --> 05:13:54.856]  So I think that could help.
[05:13:55.396 --> 05:13:57.658]  I would also consider arming the Kurds.
[05:13:58.098 --> 05:14:05.544]  The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq, and I know there's a lot of
[05:14:06.044 --> 05:14:19.389]  Concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.
[05:14:19.409 --> 05:14:20.029]  Thank you very much.
[05:14:20.069 --> 05:14:20.770]  We're going to move on.
[05:14:20.830 --> 05:14:23.831]  She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her.
[05:14:24.491 --> 05:14:27.312]  When I go one second over, it's like... You had many answers.
[05:14:27.332 --> 05:14:28.393]  It's really very interesting.
[05:14:28.413 --> 05:14:30.533]  We've got a question over here from James Carter.
[05:14:30.554 --> 05:14:31.634]  Mr. Carter?
[05:14:37.691 --> 05:14:51.440]  My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?
[05:14:51.580 --> 05:14:53.021]  That question begins for Mr. Trump.
[05:14:53.981 --> 05:14:54.682]  Absolutely.
[05:14:55.542 --> 05:15:02.467]  I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable.
[05:15:03.863 --> 05:15:22.148]  I will be a president for all of our people, and I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around, and will give strength to people, and will give economics to people, and will bring jobs back, because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world.
[05:15:22.228 --> 05:15:23.649]  Not in this country.
[05:15:23.729 --> 05:15:25.589]  It stripped us of manufacturing jobs.
[05:15:25.609 --> 05:15:25.969]  We lost our jobs.
[05:15:28.630 --> 05:15:30.630]  We lost our money, we lost our plans.
[05:15:30.850 --> 05:15:31.911]  It is a disaster.
[05:15:32.131 --> 05:15:34.971]  And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it.
[05:15:34.991 --> 05:15:36.111]  She called it the gold standard.
[05:15:36.452 --> 05:15:40.592]  And by the way, at the last debate she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard.
[05:15:40.792 --> 05:15:43.233]  Great job Nigel Farage.
[05:15:43.293 --> 05:15:44.213]  Farage almost weak!
[05:15:44.693 --> 05:15:46.133]  She lied, okay?
[05:15:46.253 --> 05:15:48.154]  And she lied, but she's lied about a lot of things.
[05:15:48.594 --> 05:15:53.695]  I would be a president for all of the people, African Americans, the inner cities.
[05:15:54.906 --> 05:15:56.988]  It's devastating what's happening to our inner cities.
[05:15:57.309 --> 05:15:58.670]  She's been talking about it for years.
[05:15:58.851 --> 05:16:01.754]  As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens.
[05:16:02.115 --> 05:16:02.895]  She doesn't get it done.
[05:16:03.951 --> 05:16:09.892]  Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans, the same exact thing.
[05:16:10.312 --> 05:16:11.813]  They talk, they don't get it done.
[05:16:12.193 --> 05:16:15.153]  You go into the inner cities and you see it's 45% poverty.
[05:16:15.753 --> 05:16:19.474]  African Americans now 45% poverty in the inner cities.
[05:16:20.374 --> 05:16:22.195]  The education is a disaster.
[05:16:22.995 --> 05:16:25.595]  Jobs are essentially non-existent.
[05:16:26.716 --> 05:16:31.777]  I mean, and I've been saying big speeches where I have 20 and 30,000 people.
[05:16:33.877 --> 05:16:34.778]  What do you have to lose?
[05:16:35.378 --> 05:16:36.139]  It can't get any worse.
[05:16:36.519 --> 05:16:38.421]  And she's been talking about the inner cities for 25 years.
[05:16:38.441 --> 05:16:39.521]  Look at her sitting on her ass.
[05:16:39.722 --> 05:16:40.422]  Mention that, Trump.
[05:16:40.662 --> 05:16:41.603]  Nothing's going to ever happen.
[05:16:41.643 --> 05:16:45.186]  Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen.
[05:16:45.206 --> 05:16:48.428]  She's going to be talking to all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about.
[05:16:49.509 --> 05:16:51.130]  And I would just get it by osmosis.
[05:16:51.851 --> 05:16:52.971]  She's not doing me favors.
[05:16:53.672 --> 05:16:56.053]  But by doing all the others favors, she's doing me favors.
[05:16:57.094 --> 05:17:00.936]  But I will tell you, she's all talk, it doesn't get done.
[05:17:00.996 --> 05:17:02.637]  All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.
[05:17:02.657 --> 05:17:03.858]  Take a look at upstate New York.
[05:17:10.876 --> 05:17:14.918]  67% of the people voted to re-elect me for my second term.
[05:17:15.478 --> 05:17:17.859]  And I was very proud and very humbled by that.
[05:17:18.339 --> 05:17:27.202]  Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families.
[05:17:28.476 --> 05:17:31.478]  You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund.
[05:17:31.518 --> 05:17:33.799]  And Donald talks a lot about... You represented pedophiles.
[05:17:34.019 --> 05:17:37.241]  You know... And said you knew 12-year-olds were raped in a convo... For 30 years I've been in public service.
[05:17:37.261 --> 05:17:38.001]  You made stuff up.
[05:17:38.302 --> 05:17:39.002]  I'm proud of that.
[05:17:39.642 --> 05:17:47.547]  You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system.
[05:17:47.587 --> 05:17:49.168]  By the way, they're completely biased and deny it.
[05:17:49.188 --> 05:17:53.110]  I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care about.
[05:17:54.651 --> 05:17:55.712]  Very much about.
[05:17:55.732 --> 05:17:58.194]  I have worked with Latinos.
[05:17:58.294 --> 05:18:03.579]  One of my first jobs in politics was down in South Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote.
[05:18:03.599 --> 05:18:09.204]  So I have a deep devotion to making sure that every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.
[05:18:19.116 --> 05:18:26.781]  I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn't have a place in Donald Trump's America.
[05:18:28.502 --> 05:18:32.785]  They write me and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix.
[05:18:32.825 --> 05:18:35.386]  She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler.
[05:18:35.606 --> 05:18:36.487]  He's 10 years old now.
[05:18:36.507 --> 05:18:38.088]  It's the only country he's ever known.
[05:18:38.868 --> 05:18:46.233]  And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will you send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?
[05:18:47.867 --> 05:18:53.271]  You know, children listen to what is being said, to go back to the very, very first question.
[05:18:53.431 --> 05:18:55.813]  Oh, children heard what he did.
[05:18:55.893 --> 05:18:59.096]  Teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect.
[05:18:59.116 --> 05:18:59.976]  Bullying is up.
[05:19:00.056 --> 05:19:02.898]  A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy.
[05:19:02.918 --> 05:19:05.240]  A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.
[05:19:05.861 --> 05:19:07.222]  So first and foremost,
[05:19:08.422 --> 05:19:08.642]  I don't
[05:19:26.244 --> 05:19:27.306]  I thought it would be fair.
[05:19:27.526 --> 05:19:28.807]  I thought he wasn't going to be bad.
[05:19:28.847 --> 05:19:31.291]  He was bad out of the gate.
[05:19:31.611 --> 05:19:33.273]  He's been better since the U.S.
[05:19:33.333 --> 05:19:33.934]  has been horrible.
[05:19:34.214 --> 05:19:34.655]  Oh, here he goes.
[05:19:34.835 --> 05:19:36.437]  Homophobic, xenophobic.
[05:19:36.557 --> 05:19:38.820]  He was writing articles for the advocates 25 years ago.
[05:19:42.861 --> 05:19:51.328]  Well, within hours, I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that because my argument is not with his supporters, it's with him.
[05:19:51.348 --> 05:19:54.830]  And with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run.
[05:19:54.950 --> 05:19:58.633]  And the inciting of violence at his rallies.
[05:19:58.773 --> 05:20:06.059]  And the very brutal kinds of comments about, not just women, but all Americans.
[05:20:06.299 --> 05:20:07.560]  All kinds of Americans.
[05:20:08.621 --> 05:20:11.822]  Have you tuned in to Howard Stern, who's a big liberal?
[05:20:11.903 --> 05:20:12.583]  It's a joke!
[05:20:12.663 --> 05:20:13.843]  It's speech, lady!
[05:20:14.023 --> 05:20:17.805]  He doesn't fund radical Muslims to cut women's salaries off!
[05:20:17.825 --> 05:20:18.886]  He doesn't represent rapists!
[05:20:18.926 --> 05:20:19.306]  His husband!
[05:20:19.326 --> 05:20:20.907]  He doesn't fly around on great planes!
[05:20:24.730 --> 05:20:29.514]  A lot of the tone and tenor that he has said, I'm proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran.
[05:20:29.594 --> 05:20:33.518]  We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults, and he is supporting me 100%.
[05:20:35.279 --> 05:20:37.481]  Because we talked about what we wanted to do.
[05:20:37.541 --> 05:20:46.108]  We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates, but we believed that we could make the country better, and I was proud of that.
[05:20:46.148 --> 05:20:47.570]  We have a divided nation.
[05:20:48.663 --> 05:20:50.364]  We have a very divided nation.
[05:20:50.684 --> 05:20:51.644]  You look at Charlotte.
[05:20:52.064 --> 05:20:53.145]  You look at Baltimore.
[05:20:53.505 --> 05:20:57.887]  You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago.
[05:20:58.387 --> 05:21:00.268]  You take a look at Washington, D.C.
[05:21:00.348 --> 05:21:01.409]  Foreign leaders will love Trump.
[05:21:01.449 --> 05:21:01.749]  It's real.
[05:21:01.789 --> 05:21:05.550]  We have an increase in murders within our cities.
[05:21:05.931 --> 05:21:07.711]  The biggest in 45 years.
[05:21:07.791 --> 05:21:11.053]  We have a divided nation because people like her, and believe me,
[05:21:11.986 --> 05:21:13.828]  She has tremendous hate in her heart.
[05:21:13.968 --> 05:21:14.408]  Absolutely.
[05:21:14.528 --> 05:21:17.391]  And when she said deplorables, she meant it.
[05:21:17.851 --> 05:21:20.994]  And when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable!
[05:21:21.575 --> 05:21:22.375]  You didn't mention that.
[05:21:22.876 --> 05:21:26.319]  But when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.
[05:21:26.499 --> 05:21:27.420]  They don't exist!
[05:21:29.192 --> 05:21:36.658]  She's got tremendous hatred, and this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her.
[05:21:36.939 --> 05:21:38.300]  Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you.
[05:21:38.340 --> 05:21:43.504]  In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline.
[05:21:43.884 --> 05:21:47.848]  You said, if a leader doesn't have it, quote, he or she won't be one for very long.
[05:21:48.348 --> 05:21:51.831]  In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m.
[05:21:51.851 --> 05:21:54.774]  to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape.
[05:21:55.214 --> 05:21:56.175]  Is that just a point of view?
[05:22:13.485 --> 05:22:19.309]  She didn't answer because when Ambassador Stevens... 600 times.
[05:22:19.369 --> 05:22:21.471]  She said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning.
[05:22:21.711 --> 05:22:24.613]  And she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that.
[05:22:25.014 --> 05:22:26.194]  But she said she'll be awake.
[05:22:26.235 --> 05:22:27.275]  Who's the famous thing?
[05:22:27.575 --> 05:22:29.197]  We're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning.
[05:22:29.237 --> 05:22:29.797]  Guess what happened?
[05:22:30.318 --> 05:22:33.620]  Ambassador Stevens, Ambassador Stevens, 600 requests for help.
[05:22:36.842 --> 05:22:43.826]  And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend, and not a guy, by the way.
[05:22:43.866 --> 05:22:46.587]  So, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that.
[05:22:46.827 --> 05:22:50.729]  Now, tweeting happens to be a modern-day form of communication.
[05:22:50.769 --> 05:22:51.869]  I mean, you could like it or not.
[05:22:51.889 --> 05:22:53.770]  Why do men run the wars when they have to?
[05:22:53.790 --> 05:22:55.151]  Because they'll kill themselves to fight, folks.
[05:22:55.171 --> 05:22:55.651]  Women are great.
[05:22:55.671 --> 05:22:56.712]  They're going to have babies.
[05:22:56.732 --> 05:22:56.932]  We can't.
[05:22:56.952 --> 05:22:58.713]  It's a very effective way of communication.
[05:22:58.773 --> 05:23:03.195]  So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication.
[05:23:03.295 --> 05:23:05.296]  I'm not unproud of it, to be honest with you.
[05:23:05.876 --> 05:23:08.339]  Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?
[05:23:09.380 --> 05:23:09.580]  No.
[05:23:10.060 --> 05:23:10.961]  I'm shocked to hear that.
[05:23:11.182 --> 05:23:13.604]  The secret as he goes about it, in about ten, gets up at three.
[05:23:13.864 --> 05:23:18.969]  It's not only my opinion, it's the opinion of many others.
[05:23:19.950 --> 05:23:24.555]  National security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress.
[05:23:24.635 --> 05:23:25.296]  I need seven hours.
[05:23:25.336 --> 05:23:26.958]  But it's in part because
[05:23:28.160 --> 05:23:48.026]  Those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.
[05:23:48.566 --> 05:23:49.106]  Everybody.
[05:23:49.466 --> 05:23:51.086]  African American incomes went up 33%.
[05:23:51.987 --> 05:23:56.048]  And it's not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9-11.
[05:23:57.932 --> 05:24:04.556]  And I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said, you've got it, and he never wavered.
[05:24:04.596 --> 05:24:05.437]  He stuck with me.
[05:24:06.718 --> 05:24:09.319]  And I have worked, and I admire President Obama.
[05:24:09.940 --> 05:24:13.102]  He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
[05:24:13.722 --> 05:24:16.964]  That was a terrible time for our country.
[05:24:17.644 --> 05:24:19.586]  Nine million people lost their jobs.
[05:24:19.606 --> 05:24:21.127]  Five million homes were lost.
[05:24:21.687 --> 05:24:22.708]  Thank you very much, both of you.
[05:24:49.369 --> 05:24:51.015]  We have another audience question.
[05:24:51.095 --> 05:24:53.905]  Beth Miller has a question for both candidates.
[05:24:55.015 --> 05:24:55.995]  This is not as bad as Lester Holt.
[05:24:56.015 --> 05:24:56.456]  Good evening.
[05:24:56.936 --> 05:25:01.198]  Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice.
[05:25:01.658 --> 05:25:07.200]  What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?
[05:25:07.940 --> 05:25:10.281]  We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.
[05:25:10.301 --> 05:25:10.701]  Thank you.
[05:25:10.721 --> 05:25:11.442]  Well, you're right.
[05:25:11.542 --> 05:25:14.843]  This is one of the most important issues in this election.
[05:25:14.863 --> 05:25:16.204]  We've already packed with operatives.
[05:25:16.344 --> 05:25:17.264]  One more, we win.
[05:25:17.584 --> 05:25:24.107]  I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have a real life experience.
[05:25:24.987 --> 05:25:32.712]  Who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but maybe they tried some more cases.
[05:25:32.752 --> 05:25:36.214]  They actually understand what people are up against.
[05:25:36.274 --> 05:25:40.056]  I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.
[05:25:40.236 --> 05:25:43.859]  I don't care if we have a Hispanic woman or a black guy, just make me probe guns.
[05:25:43.939 --> 05:25:45.399]  Reverse Citizens United.
[05:25:46.040 --> 05:25:48.902]  And get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics.
[05:25:49.662 --> 05:25:50.763]  Donald doesn't agree with that.
[05:25:51.471 --> 05:25:56.793]  I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country.
[05:25:57.133 --> 05:26:01.015]  I say appoint all Hispanic women, just have them be constitutional.
[05:26:01.055 --> 05:26:01.395]  I'm serious.
[05:26:01.435 --> 05:26:02.975]  I don't care what people call them.
[05:26:02.995 --> 05:26:03.335]  Leave me alone!
[05:26:03.355 --> 05:26:07.117]  Older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.
[05:26:08.112 --> 05:26:16.414]  I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.
[05:26:17.194 --> 05:26:20.855]  Oh, everyone's being so mean to the gay people, oh my gosh.
[05:26:21.575 --> 05:26:28.257]  And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality.
[05:26:28.437 --> 05:26:31.598]  I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.
[05:26:32.438 --> 05:26:36.241]  I want a Supreme Court that doesn't always side with corporate interests.
[05:26:36.741 --> 05:26:43.466]  I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights.
[05:26:43.486 --> 05:26:45.167]  You should have any more rights than anybody else.
[05:26:45.267 --> 05:26:49.250]  So I have very clear views about what I want to see do.
[05:26:50.126 --> 05:26:53.147]  It's time to change the balance for the Supreme Court.
[05:26:53.207 --> 05:26:56.387]  And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job.
[05:26:56.707 --> 05:27:09.030]  And they have not committed a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices.
[05:27:09.550 --> 05:27:11.511]  I think that was a dereliction of duty.
[05:27:14.025 --> 05:27:21.989]  Their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that.
[05:27:22.069 --> 05:27:25.531]  We have nine justices and we can work on behalf of our people.
[05:27:25.551 --> 05:27:27.092]  Thank you, you're out of time, Mr. Trump.
[05:27:27.553 --> 05:27:31.155]  Justice Scalia, great judge.
[05:27:31.495 --> 05:27:32.835]  Died mysteriously in Texas.
[05:27:33.756 --> 05:27:35.577]  And we have a vacancy.
[05:27:36.658 --> 05:27:42.321]  I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.
[05:27:43.365 --> 05:27:50.032]  I'm looking for judges, and I've actually picked 20 of them, so that people would see.
[05:27:50.272 --> 05:27:57.519]  Highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.
[05:27:58.120 --> 05:28:01.443]  But people that will respect the Constitution.
[05:28:02.444 --> 05:28:03.466]  Of the United States.
[05:28:04.327 --> 05:28:06.630]  And I think that this is so important.
[05:28:06.650 --> 05:28:08.352]  That's right, go somewhere else if you don't like our system.
[05:28:08.372 --> 05:28:11.076]  Which is totally under-smashed by people like Hillary Clinton.
[05:28:11.096 --> 05:28:12.497]  There's no wealth to steal for this pig.
[05:28:12.537 --> 05:28:15.201]  They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for.
[05:28:15.221 --> 05:28:16.843]  Because liberty makes the wealthy, you pig!
[05:28:17.244 --> 05:28:18.185]  You parasite maggot!
[05:28:20.127 --> 05:28:22.289]  Uh, contributions, just so you understand.
[05:28:22.329 --> 05:28:32.875]  So, I will have, in my race, more than a hundred million dollars put in, of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations.
[05:28:32.915 --> 05:28:38.479]  What I ask is this, so, I'm putting in more than, by the time it's finished, I'll have more than a hundred million dollars invested.
[05:28:39.520 --> 05:28:40.681]  Pretty much self-funding mine.
[05:28:40.701 --> 05:28:42.504]  We're raising money for the Republican Party.
[05:28:42.544 --> 05:28:44.526]  And we're doing tremendously on small donations.
[05:28:44.546 --> 05:28:44.907]  That's right.
[05:28:44.967 --> 05:28:45.868]  He spent $100 million in small money.
[05:28:45.888 --> 05:28:48.030]  He has to raise money for the Republican establishment.
[05:28:48.091 --> 05:28:52.956]  I asked Hillary, why do you think she made $250 million by being in office?
[05:28:53.797 --> 05:28:56.020]  She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.
[05:28:56.060 --> 05:28:56.481]  Good job, Trump.
[05:28:56.861 --> 05:28:58.363]  Why don't you put $10 or $20 or $25 or $30 million into your own campaign?
[05:28:58.383 --> 05:29:00.505]  It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do.
[05:29:00.525 --> 05:29:01.746]  And it would really, I think, be a nice sign.
[05:29:12.637 --> 05:29:13.518]  To the American public.
[05:29:13.538 --> 05:29:14.880]  Why aren't you putting your own money in?
[05:29:15.080 --> 05:29:15.861]  You have a lot of it.
[05:29:15.881 --> 05:29:16.702]  You've made a lot of it.
[05:29:16.762 --> 05:29:17.442]  I'm a millionaire.
[05:29:17.462 --> 05:29:18.383]  Let me start by saying I'm a millionaire.
[05:29:18.403 --> 05:29:19.565]  Because of the fact that you've been in office.
[05:29:20.045 --> 05:29:21.987]  You've made a lot of it while you were Secretary of State, actually.
[05:29:22.027 --> 05:29:23.008]  I've spent everything I got.
[05:29:23.028 --> 05:29:23.529]  I'm broke.
[05:29:23.569 --> 05:29:25.631]  So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign?
[05:29:25.651 --> 05:29:26.332]  I'm just curious.
[05:29:26.532 --> 05:29:27.353]  I've spent everything I got.
[05:29:27.373 --> 05:29:28.334]  Well, thank you very much.
[05:29:28.354 --> 05:29:29.816]  We're going to get on to one more question.
[05:29:29.856 --> 05:29:32.939]  The question was about the Supreme Court, and I just want to quickly say... Very quickly.
[05:29:33.079 --> 05:29:34.340]  I respect the Second Amendment.
[05:29:35.083 --> 05:29:36.405]  You're a goddamn liar!
[05:29:36.425 --> 05:29:38.668]  But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks.
[05:29:38.688 --> 05:29:40.950]  We have her WikiLeaks, she's gonna ban it with executive orders.
[05:29:40.990 --> 05:29:42.592]  And close the online loophole.
[05:29:42.793 --> 05:29:44.995]  We have one more question, Mrs. Frexen.
[05:29:45.015 --> 05:29:49.801]  We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy.
[05:29:49.821 --> 05:29:49.982]  Ken?
[05:29:51.240 --> 05:29:52.440]  She says she wants to bankrupt coal?
[05:29:53.140 --> 05:29:53.320]  Great!
[05:29:53.501 --> 05:29:54.101]  That's most of our power!
[05:29:54.121 --> 05:30:04.403]  What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?
[05:30:05.403 --> 05:30:10.925]  Such a great question because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.
[05:30:11.065 --> 05:30:12.145]  Under absolute siege.
[05:30:13.334 --> 05:30:18.137]  The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies.
[05:30:19.017 --> 05:30:21.739]  And foreign companies are now coming in and buying our plants.
[05:30:21.759 --> 05:30:22.459]  China has none of this.
[05:30:22.519 --> 05:30:24.140]  That's why they have three times cheaper energy.
[05:30:24.160 --> 05:30:24.580]  He's right.
[05:30:24.760 --> 05:30:27.922]  And then rejiggering the plant so that they can take care of their own.
[05:30:27.942 --> 05:30:30.203]  How do you build somewhere that has three times expensive energy?
[05:30:30.223 --> 05:30:30.703]  It's over!
[05:30:30.723 --> 05:30:31.424]  It's game over!
[05:30:31.844 --> 05:30:33.425]  Our energy business in this country.
[05:30:33.525 --> 05:30:36.127]  Now I'm all for alternative forms of energy.
[05:30:36.147 --> 05:30:36.628]  We have clean coal!
[05:30:36.648 --> 05:30:39.030]  Including wind, including solar, etc.
[05:30:39.390 --> 05:30:41.291]  But we need much more than wind and solar.
[05:30:41.432 --> 05:30:41.632]  Yes!
[05:30:42.312 --> 05:30:43.713]  And you look at our miners.
[05:30:43.733 --> 05:30:46.335]  Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.
[05:30:46.435 --> 05:30:47.556]  We need the cheapest energy in the world.
[05:30:47.576 --> 05:30:49.398]  There is a thing called clean coal.
[05:30:50.168 --> 05:30:50.669]  We discovered it!
[05:30:50.689 --> 05:30:51.029]  The oil, dumbass!
[05:30:51.049 --> 05:30:51.109]  Yes!
[05:30:51.129 --> 05:30:52.150]  This bitch is holding us back.
[05:30:52.170 --> 05:30:52.710]  She's a piece of filth.
[05:30:52.731 --> 05:30:54.432]  I want to make you rich!
[05:31:07.998 --> 05:31:10.919]  He's a renaissance man, he's an angel, people don't know it.
[05:31:26.443 --> 05:31:28.525]  We have to bring back our workers.
[05:31:28.565 --> 05:31:40.214]  You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel, and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steel workers and our steel companies.
[05:31:41.175 --> 05:31:42.996]  We have to guard our energy companies.
[05:31:45.478 --> 05:31:45.978]  Possible.
[05:31:46.339 --> 05:31:52.362]  The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.
[05:31:52.382 --> 05:31:53.163]  That's how they conquered it.
[05:31:53.203 --> 05:31:53.683]  It was a plan, folks.
[05:31:53.723 --> 05:31:55.504]  Trump is here to stop a global shutdown.
[05:31:55.524 --> 05:31:57.145]  The Russians have put out of business.
[05:31:57.505 --> 05:31:59.086]  That's why they're like, Trump, yes!
[05:31:59.106 --> 05:31:59.426]  They did it!
[05:31:59.446 --> 05:32:00.307]  They did it on a Russian agent!
[05:32:00.327 --> 05:32:01.087]  We're all being screwed!
[05:32:01.188 --> 05:32:01.848]  Your time is up.
[05:32:01.868 --> 05:32:02.268]  Thank you, sir.
[05:32:02.368 --> 05:32:04.490]  And actually, Secretary Clinton, two minutes.
[05:32:04.530 --> 05:32:05.570]  Well, that was very interesting.
[05:32:15.576 --> 05:32:18.097]  I've combined forces with the Chinese to kill one of the millions.
[05:32:18.117 --> 05:32:18.417]  I'm liberal.
[05:32:18.437 --> 05:32:22.578]  China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings.
[05:32:23.638 --> 05:32:25.518]  Putting steel workers and American steel plants out of business.
[05:32:25.558 --> 05:32:26.619]  Because he's not going to pay three times as much!
[05:32:26.639 --> 05:32:27.239]  He's been honest!
[05:32:27.899 --> 05:32:39.282]  That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.
[05:32:40.402 --> 05:32:44.584]  You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business.
[05:32:44.644 --> 05:32:48.585]  You know that we are now, for the first time ever, energy independent.
[05:32:48.945 --> 05:32:54.267]  We are not dependent upon the Middle East, but the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.
[05:32:54.327 --> 05:32:56.708]  So the price of oil has been way down.
[05:32:56.928 --> 05:33:01.190]  And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?
[05:33:02.113 --> 05:33:08.576]  We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.
[05:33:08.796 --> 05:33:11.738]  And I think that's an important transition.
[05:33:12.678 --> 05:33:14.879]  We've got to remain energy independent.
[05:33:14.959 --> 05:33:20.902]  It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.
[05:33:20.942 --> 05:33:24.244]  We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.
[05:33:24.984 --> 05:33:32.766]  So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem.
[05:33:33.706 --> 05:33:39.427]  And I support moving for more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can.
[05:33:39.447 --> 05:33:42.928]  We just showed the Washington Post saying it's made up.
[05:33:42.968 --> 05:33:44.388]  He never said mangrove coal.
[05:33:44.428 --> 05:33:46.949]  So let's actually hear from Obama instead of the Washington Post.
[05:33:46.969 --> 05:33:47.629]  Let's play that clip.
[05:33:49.588 --> 05:33:51.992]  So, if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can.
[05:33:52.613 --> 05:34:00.464]  It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted.
[05:34:02.314 --> 05:34:03.194]  ...and their grandfathers.
[05:34:03.895 --> 05:34:05.035]  They dug that coal out.
[05:34:05.055 --> 05:34:06.995]  A lot of them lost their lives.
[05:34:07.015 --> 05:34:07.816]  They were injured.
[05:34:08.276 --> 05:34:10.776]  But they turned the lights on and they powered our factories.
[05:34:10.876 --> 05:34:12.097]  I don't want to walk away from them.
[05:34:12.237 --> 05:34:13.837]  So we've got to do something for them.
[05:34:14.197 --> 05:34:16.718]  But the price of coal is down worldwide.
[05:34:17.018 --> 05:34:20.799]  So we have to look at this comprehensively and that's exactly what I have proposed.
[05:34:21.139 --> 05:34:22.920]  All over the world, coal competes.
[05:34:23.421 --> 05:34:25.742]  Guys, I have a family that has oil wells and gas wells.
[05:34:25.802 --> 05:34:27.283]  I get no money from it, but my family does.
[05:34:27.744 --> 05:34:28.804]  They're not immoral scum.
[05:34:29.185 --> 05:34:29.985]  They want coal.
[05:34:30.606 --> 05:34:31.226]  Lignite coal.
[05:34:31.586 --> 05:34:33.127]  Coal undercuts everything.
[05:34:33.287 --> 05:34:34.588]  They've shut coal down worldwide.
[05:34:34.628 --> 05:34:35.609]  Of course the price is down.
[05:34:35.849 --> 05:34:36.810]  No one's allowed to burn it.
[05:34:37.030 --> 05:34:38.691]  They have clean systems that cut it all out.
[05:34:39.491 --> 05:34:41.193]  I mean, I'm an expert.
[05:34:41.213 --> 05:34:42.894]  Let's have families that are petroleum geologists.
[05:34:43.134 --> 05:34:44.075]  They are screwing you.
[05:34:44.275 --> 05:34:45.475]  It's hurting the whole economy.
[05:34:45.756 --> 05:34:48.998]  That you respect in one another.
[05:34:55.009 --> 05:34:57.213]  Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?
[05:35:00.598 --> 05:35:02.381]  Well, I certainly will.
[05:35:02.782 --> 05:35:06.548]  Because I think that's a very fair and important question.
[05:35:07.049 --> 05:35:09.432]  Look, I respect his children.
[05:35:10.649 --> 05:35:18.416]  His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.
[05:35:18.596 --> 05:35:24.120]  I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.
[05:35:24.340 --> 05:35:29.865]  And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.
[05:35:32.486 --> 05:35:38.715]  I believe that this election has become, in part, so conflicting and so intense, because there's a lot at stake.
[05:35:38.795 --> 05:35:41.198]  This is not an ordinary time, and this is not...
[05:35:49.505 --> 05:35:51.206]  An ordinary election.
[05:35:51.407 --> 05:36:06.219]  We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else.
[05:36:06.239 --> 05:36:09.461]  And so there is a lot at stake.
[05:36:09.561 --> 05:36:12.304]  It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.
[05:36:13.234 --> 05:36:22.219]  And that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president.
[05:36:22.879 --> 05:36:38.748]  And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves, so that they can see that yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families, and I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.
[05:36:39.048 --> 05:36:41.529]  People can tune in to InfoWars.com and find the free right side feed.
[05:36:41.549 --> 05:36:46.572]  Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment.
[05:36:46.812 --> 05:36:49.893]  I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great.
[05:36:49.913 --> 05:36:51.254]  I'm very proud of my children.
[05:36:51.434 --> 05:36:56.356]  And they've done a wonderful job and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.
[05:36:56.416 --> 05:36:58.657]  So I consider that a compliment.
[05:36:59.618 --> 05:37:01.078]  I will say this about Hillary.
[05:37:02.039 --> 05:37:02.839]  She doesn't quit.
[05:37:03.199 --> 05:37:04.520]  She doesn't give up.
[05:37:04.560 --> 05:37:05.701]  I respect that.
[05:37:05.781 --> 05:37:06.921]  I tell it like it is.
[05:37:07.761 --> 05:37:08.402]  She's a fighter.
[05:37:09.429 --> 05:37:12.073]  I disagree with much of what she's fighting for.
[05:37:12.934 --> 05:37:15.057]  I do disagree with her judgment.
[05:37:15.758 --> 05:37:17.300]  She just wants a woman in power.
[05:37:17.480 --> 05:37:18.621]  She does fight hard.
[05:37:18.782 --> 05:37:20.163]  She doesn't quit.
[05:37:20.183 --> 05:37:20.904]  She doesn't give up.
[05:37:20.985 --> 05:37:23.508]  And I consider that to be a very good trait.
[05:37:23.548 --> 05:37:24.229]  Thanks to both of you.
[05:37:27.632 --> 05:37:29.373]  I want to thank the candidates.
[05:37:29.433 --> 05:37:31.054]  I want to thank the university here.
[05:37:31.094 --> 05:37:32.615]  This concludes the town hall meeting.
[05:37:32.655 --> 05:37:36.477]  Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched.
[05:37:36.517 --> 05:37:45.122]  Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
[05:37:45.482 --> 05:37:46.242]  Good night, everyone.
[05:37:47.443 --> 05:37:48.504]  Well, they were bad.
[05:37:48.584 --> 05:37:49.904]  They attacked Trump up front.
[05:37:49.924 --> 05:37:51.065]  They did a lot of crooked stuff.
[05:37:51.645 --> 05:37:54.387]  But, in the end of the day, it was half as bad as Lester Holtz.
[05:37:54.407 --> 05:37:56.108]  So, I'd like to give Anderson Cooper
[05:37:58.195 --> 05:37:59.536]  A little bit of a hand of applause.
[05:38:00.736 --> 05:38:02.917]  Mr... Is it Astor or Vanderbilt?
[05:38:02.937 --> 05:38:03.457]  I always forget.
[05:38:03.517 --> 05:38:06.599]  I get some little artifacts in my brain that gets that wrong.
[05:38:06.659 --> 05:38:08.119]  CJ, is it Vanderbilt or Astor?
[05:38:09.380 --> 05:38:09.780]  Vanderbilt.
[05:38:10.521 --> 05:38:10.761]  That's right.
[05:38:10.781 --> 05:38:14.662]  So you got the heir to the Vanderbilts, hundreds of millions of dollars, and all this free trust.
[05:38:15.363 --> 05:38:16.983]  And he's up there, a little CIA guy.
[05:38:17.023 --> 05:38:18.264]  He didn't just intern, folks.
[05:38:18.304 --> 05:38:20.485]  He's a CIA information warfare officer.
[05:38:20.585 --> 05:38:24.987]  I have that from people that were section chiefs in the CIA 15 years ago.
[05:38:25.127 --> 05:38:27.068]  Anderson Cooper is Central Intelligence Agency.
[05:38:28.420 --> 05:38:30.761]  And it's embarrassing to be in the CIA.
[05:38:31.221 --> 05:38:35.162]  I am so proud that I did everything I did with the help of the listeners and other patriots.
[05:38:35.602 --> 05:38:36.943]  Didn't do it by myself, did it with you.
[05:38:38.003 --> 05:38:44.645]  But any family I knew that was involved in the CIA, they just got killed or set up after they did their work.
[05:38:44.685 --> 05:38:47.566]  I would want to be involved with that organization if anything.
[05:38:47.666 --> 05:38:49.487]  I'm so proud that we did this on our own.
[05:38:50.805 --> 05:38:52.946]  So, here's to the Patriots, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:38:52.966 --> 05:38:54.226]  We're about to have Roger Stone on.
[05:38:54.266 --> 05:38:56.347]  I saw him via Skype just a moment ago.
[05:38:56.367 --> 05:38:59.568]  But let's go to some of these video feeds to see what's going on in the crowd.
[05:38:59.608 --> 05:39:04.509]  Bill Clinton was so upset when the rape information came out and him settling rape cases.
[05:39:05.650 --> 05:39:07.290]  Hillary, I gotta say, is falling down.
[05:39:07.330 --> 05:39:08.350]  Looks like hell, usually.
[05:39:08.771 --> 05:39:10.351]  She's been off the trail for over a week.
[05:39:10.871 --> 05:39:13.172]  She's announced for another 15 days she won't be on the trail.
[05:39:13.732 --> 05:39:16.073]  So I guess if she rests and takes the proper medications,
[05:39:17.128 --> 05:39:19.489]  I know he has Bill and Tim Cain as his surrogates.
[05:39:19.509 --> 05:39:21.510]  They're able to roll her out occasionally.
[05:39:21.590 --> 05:39:22.291]  I just saw Stone.
[05:39:22.311 --> 05:39:22.731]  Do we have Stone?
[05:39:22.751 --> 05:39:23.251]  Are we getting him on?
[05:39:25.493 --> 05:39:25.873]  Good, good.
[05:39:26.533 --> 05:39:27.033]  He was there, right?
[05:39:27.053 --> 05:39:27.674]  How long was he holding?
[05:39:30.855 --> 05:39:31.836]  No, we're audio checking him.
[05:39:32.455 --> 05:39:33.016]  So this is a big deal.
[05:39:33.036 --> 05:39:34.037]  I'm going to finish up with Stone.
[05:39:34.718 --> 05:39:35.499]  I got a big crew.
[05:39:35.519 --> 05:39:37.922]  Ian McAdoo, David Knight, Darren McBreen.
[05:39:38.002 --> 05:39:40.305]  I want to get Don Salazar.
[05:39:40.466 --> 05:39:41.587]  I want to get Mikael Thelen.
[05:39:41.627 --> 05:39:42.608]  I'm going to get Rob Dew.
[05:39:42.708 --> 05:39:44.351]  I'm going to get Kit Daniels.
[05:39:44.391 --> 05:39:46.533]  Everybody through here tonight to cover what's happening.
[05:39:47.134 --> 05:39:47.875]  But I got to say...
[05:39:48.576 --> 05:39:50.217]  The first 10 minutes I was in panic.
[05:39:50.237 --> 05:39:56.160]  He came out, let her savage him, lie about him, but then he turned it around and I give Donald Trump a 95.
[05:39:57.640 --> 05:40:00.402]  I'd do a 70 in a debate.
[05:40:00.502 --> 05:40:02.503]  I mean, I knew my gut is right.
[05:40:03.143 --> 05:40:04.504]  Incredible victory.
[05:40:04.904 --> 05:40:06.645]  They're going to spin it as a loss for Trump.
[05:40:07.005 --> 05:40:10.727]  But let me tell you, hands down, big victory.
[05:40:10.807 --> 05:40:12.208]  He did it with aplomb.
[05:40:12.248 --> 05:40:14.269]  He did it with very calm slickness.
[05:40:15.393 --> 05:40:16.814]  Uh, this is amazing.
[05:40:16.854 --> 05:40:27.580]  We've got the, you know, nephew of the Bushes taping this, editing it, them filing this fake lawsuit with Jane Doe's, when Clinton's flying on the plane with a convicted rapist twenty-something times.
[05:40:28.120 --> 05:40:29.141]  All of it hits tomorrow.
[05:40:30.325 --> 05:40:33.286]  Notice, Hillary kind of got ready and Trump refused to shake hands.
[05:40:33.346 --> 05:40:34.266]  Stone predicted that.
[05:40:34.627 --> 05:40:35.527]  No handshaking.
[05:40:35.867 --> 05:40:36.747]  Stone was on target.
[05:40:37.027 --> 05:40:39.748]  He's been right like 16 times out of 17 times.
[05:40:40.128 --> 05:40:41.809]  WikiLeaks admits they got threatened now.
[05:40:41.869 --> 05:40:43.169]  They didn't release the full data dump.
[05:40:43.750 --> 05:40:50.832]  Roger Stone of Stone Cold Truth, former head of the Trump campaign, worked in four administrations internally, been involved in nine campaigns.
[05:40:51.272 --> 05:40:52.833]  I have not talked to you.
[05:40:54.235 --> 05:40:58.020]  Since six o'clock, two hours before the debate, you heard my analysis.
[05:40:58.040 --> 05:40:59.422]  You always tell me what you really think.
[05:40:59.743 --> 05:41:03.969]  Am I wrong or was this a huge Trump victory?
[05:41:05.211 --> 05:41:06.953]  Alex, I'm very pleased.
[05:41:07.233 --> 05:41:10.797]  This is the Donald Trump that I know, Trump being himself.
[05:41:11.457 --> 05:41:24.731]  Combative, wily, getting back to his central themes, not letting her lie, not letting her set the agenda, not letting her dominate the subject matter.
[05:41:25.311 --> 05:41:28.475]  Uh, and you can see the flop sweat breaking out on her forehead.
[05:41:28.535 --> 05:41:34.902]  You can see her jaw clenching because she's never been confronted, certainly not by a federal prosecutor.
[05:41:34.922 --> 05:41:39.627]  Uh, he scored by saying, I will appoint a special prosecutor.
[05:41:40.168 --> 05:41:46.754]  This is his way of telling the Clintons and their daughter they're going to prison over their massive corruption.
[05:41:47.214 --> 05:41:54.161]  He strips away the fraud of her foreign policy, talking about Libya, talking about Syria.
[05:41:54.541 --> 05:41:58.604]  He debunks the idea that he has any connection to the Russians.
[05:41:59.786 --> 05:42:02.108]  And he hammers her on the integrity issues.
[05:42:03.108 --> 05:42:12.394]  I just saw a focus group poll by Frank Luntz at Fox, a man who looks like he has a Danish stapled on his head.
[05:42:13.395 --> 05:42:20.699]  But he shows overwhelming, almost 2 to 1, his focus group of voters believe Donald Trump won this debate.
[05:42:21.320 --> 05:42:24.302]  So Alex, this is a race again.
[05:42:24.382 --> 05:42:27.364]  Donald Trump did what he had to do.
[05:42:27.704 --> 05:42:30.586]  In fact, I would say he's back in the poll position, but narrowly.
[05:42:31.286 --> 05:42:39.012]  Well, I will know that in a couple days, but he had certain minimum requirements and I think he greatly exceeded them.
[05:42:39.192 --> 05:42:51.241]  No, but I agree, saying you're going to prison, you've sold us out, you're with Al Qaeda, I mean, let me say, it was so much better than the last thing, I lowered expectations, but this was epic.
[05:42:52.298 --> 05:43:00.671]  Well, in a certain sense, he lowered expectations with his previous performance, but he also showed excellent grasp of the details of Obamacare.
[05:43:00.891 --> 05:43:02.453]  Very presidential on war.
[05:43:02.814 --> 05:43:04.356]  Very presidential on taxes.
[05:43:04.997 --> 05:43:07.781]  I mean, what reality does she live in?
[05:43:09.263 --> 05:43:10.965]  The insurance companies are pulling out.
[05:43:11.105 --> 05:43:13.948]  Obamacare is in collapse.
[05:43:14.028 --> 05:43:16.951]  My parents had never used their insurance in 20 years.
[05:43:18.012 --> 05:43:19.794]  My dad's a physician, just retired last year.
[05:43:20.175 --> 05:43:22.277]  It doubled and tripled in three years.
[05:43:22.757 --> 05:43:28.323]  Everyone I know is getting $5,000 fines and they're up there still saying it's the best thing since sliced bread.
[05:43:28.343 --> 05:43:29.865]  They're totally disconnected.
[05:43:30.919 --> 05:43:35.300]  Well, and again, she says, my friend Michelle Obama, let's be very clear.
[05:43:36.020 --> 05:43:39.682]  She hates Michelle Obama, and Michelle Obama hates her.
[05:43:39.762 --> 05:43:40.782]  And Trump made that point.
[05:43:41.742 --> 05:43:43.883]  Why is there this hatred between Obama and the Clintons?
[05:43:43.903 --> 05:43:48.104]  Because I know Obama's bad, but I gotta say, in my gut, I think Hillary's worse than Obama.
[05:43:48.834 --> 05:44:02.260]  Well, uh, the Obamas hate Hillary because Sidney Blumenthal, whose name came up several times, spread the rumors that Obama was gay, spread the rumors that Frank Marshall Davis was Obama's... And that he was from Kenya.
[05:44:02.280 --> 05:44:03.160]  Everything.
[05:44:03.280 --> 05:44:09.823]  Spread the rumors that he was from Kenya, and of course the birth, the entire birther thing, which Trump nailed her on.
[05:44:10.304 --> 05:44:15.266]  Birtherism comes from Hillary... Can I just say, your paddock watch looks incredible.
[05:44:16.274 --> 05:44:17.155]  Yes, why thank you.
[05:44:17.375 --> 05:44:18.015]  Is that a paddock?
[05:44:18.035 --> 05:44:19.036]  It is.
[05:44:19.376 --> 05:44:20.998]  A gift from my first wife.
[05:44:21.178 --> 05:44:23.059]  Can I, can I, I saw you in the photo with Nixon with that.
[05:44:23.099 --> 05:44:23.820]  Can I please see it?
[05:44:23.840 --> 05:44:25.721]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is a legend.
[05:44:25.761 --> 05:44:26.542]  I'm not even a watch guy.
[05:44:26.562 --> 05:44:27.843]  That is a legendary paddock.
[05:44:28.818 --> 05:44:30.298]  This is the Rose Gold.
[05:44:31.059 --> 05:44:33.079]  They have reproduced it now.
[05:44:33.119 --> 05:44:34.179]  You can buy it again.
[05:44:35.180 --> 05:44:38.700]  But the cost now is much greater than the time that I was able to get it.
[05:44:38.720 --> 05:44:39.921]  I didn't mean to get off to the side.
[05:44:39.961 --> 05:44:40.801]  Your style is amazing.
[05:44:41.361 --> 05:44:43.421]  Now, Roger, you know I'm honest.
[05:44:43.481 --> 05:44:45.362]  I said last time I didn't like it.
[05:44:45.382 --> 05:44:47.342]  I'm in really good mood right now.
[05:44:47.642 --> 05:44:49.443]  But we've got to get ready for the horrible news tomorrow.
[05:44:50.083 --> 05:44:50.503]  We're good to go.
[05:45:13.047 --> 05:45:13.448]  I think so.
[05:45:26.459 --> 05:45:40.204]  Well, first of all, on the one hand, I'm glad that the Trump campaign has finally been able to sort out the difference between infidelity and indiscretions and violent, brutal rape and sexual assault.
[05:45:40.224 --> 05:45:42.905]  Yeah, no one cares about infidelity in a libertine world.
[05:45:43.005 --> 05:45:50.007]  It's not good, but that's... people have their... raping little kids is bad, raping girls on the side of the road when they're 12 in a coma for five days, that's wrong.
[05:45:50.851 --> 05:45:59.282]  Well, in all honesty, from a strategic and tactical point of view, if it were up to me, I would have utilized the victim's
[05:46:00.436 --> 05:46:02.358]  I don't think this is his fault, but the idea that
[05:46:25.199 --> 05:46:32.543]  Putting these women, all of whom have suffered greatly at the hands of the Clintons, in a press event will rattle the Clintons.
[05:46:32.583 --> 05:46:33.483]  That won't rattle the Clintons.
[05:46:33.544 --> 05:46:34.564]  By the way, let me bring this up.
[05:46:34.644 --> 05:46:36.105]  I have a bunch of people coming on.
[05:46:36.225 --> 05:46:42.748]  I had a witness on earlier who was a Democratic Master Delegate, National Delegate, Super Delegate in 96.
[05:46:43.409 --> 05:46:46.611]  He said Clinton was rampaging, grabbing women everywhere.
[05:46:46.911 --> 05:46:48.832]  Hillary was flipping out, cussing everyone out.
[05:46:49.432 --> 05:46:52.273]  Jesse Jackson had to basically protect women from Bill.
[05:46:52.613 --> 05:46:53.553]  This guy's powerful.
[05:46:53.593 --> 05:46:55.514]  He's the one in Nevada that exposed him.
[05:46:55.534 --> 05:46:56.554]  He sent us his credentials.
[05:46:56.934 --> 05:46:58.375]  He was high-level Democrat.
[05:46:58.875 --> 05:46:59.655]  He believed it all.
[05:46:59.695 --> 05:47:00.255]  He's a liberal.
[05:47:00.515 --> 05:47:13.999]  He got there and saw their psycho behavior, which I've interviewed two Secret Service agents, an FBI agent, and off record, I haven't announced this yet, a Blackwater and a Special Forces Green Beret separately told me Hillary flips out at bases.
[05:47:14.818 --> 05:47:18.280]  And starts just cussing everyone out and, like, flying and throwing stuff.
[05:47:18.601 --> 05:47:19.561]  She is psychotic.
[05:47:19.581 --> 05:47:22.683]  Like General Flynn said, she's totally unstable.
[05:47:23.084 --> 05:47:24.224]  She's beyond bipolar.
[05:47:24.284 --> 05:47:25.225]  She is psychotic.
[05:47:26.086 --> 05:47:28.907]  Yeah, I think she's mentally imbalanced.
[05:47:28.988 --> 05:47:35.392]  The Hillary Clinton you saw on TV with that kind of frozen phony smile, that's not Hillary.
[05:47:35.472 --> 05:47:44.358]  Hillary is a vicious, abusive, short-tempered, foul-mouthed, entitled kleptocrat.
[05:47:44.998 --> 05:47:48.460]  Uh, she, her power lust, uh, knows no bounds.
[05:47:48.700 --> 05:47:53.342]  If you've seen House of Cards, she is Claire Underwood, only worse.
[05:47:53.602 --> 05:47:55.003]  In fact, I say it's based on that.
[05:47:55.023 --> 05:47:57.644]  Leigh Ann McEnroe was telling me she read articles where they admit Claire Underwood is her.
[05:47:57.704 --> 05:47:58.504]  Is that, is that accurate?
[05:47:59.244 --> 05:48:00.685]  Uh, it certainly appears that way.
[05:48:01.025 --> 05:48:08.328]  Although they do have one scene in which she sits, uh, Claire Underwood sits on a toilet while holding a meeting.
[05:48:08.348 --> 05:48:11.690]  Uh, and that's on the perspective of Lyndon Johnson.
[05:48:12.236 --> 05:48:13.240]  Yeah, it's LBJ.
[05:48:13.260 --> 05:48:15.369]  I had a family that talked to LBJ while he took a crap.
[05:48:15.389 --> 05:48:16.895]  It was like some dominance thing he did, but...
[05:48:18.186 --> 05:48:20.007]  That was a wet worker, though.
[05:48:20.347 --> 05:48:23.509]  Okay, so if we're looking at all this, then what else do we take from this?
[05:48:23.889 --> 05:48:26.131]  I would say Trump came back to even or to head here.
[05:48:26.151 --> 05:48:29.353]  Correct me if I'm wrong, what do we expect as the counter-offensive?
[05:48:29.413 --> 05:48:30.013]  What do we do?
[05:48:30.373 --> 05:48:31.694]  What do we see before the next debate?
[05:48:32.174 --> 05:48:33.435]  Obviously, all hell's about to break loose.
[05:48:33.455 --> 05:48:35.757]  You told me a year ago they were going to bring out this pedophile crap.
[05:48:36.317 --> 05:48:37.137]  It's now happened.
[05:48:37.778 --> 05:48:39.499]  I was talking to our sources two days ago.
[05:48:39.559 --> 05:48:41.120]  I called you and you said, yeah, I know about that.
[05:48:41.500 --> 05:48:42.120]  It's coming out.
[05:48:42.221 --> 05:48:43.381]  It's in the news today.
[05:48:43.761 --> 05:48:45.943]  The judge in The Weeknd, who's Democrat-appointed,
[05:48:46.664 --> 05:49:00.186]  Uh, by Obama in the same district as Hillary in the Senate district in California, in New York, is going ahead with Jane Doe's, no witnesses, just imaginary Kafkaesque events that Donald Trump is raping children.
[05:49:01.731 --> 05:49:06.555]  I actually got a call from an MSNBC reporter tonight who wanted to talk about this.
[05:49:07.836 --> 05:49:12.559]  And her argument was, well, now Trump has been exposed as a rapist.
[05:49:13.020 --> 05:49:15.822]  Don't you think this neutrals out the attacks on Bill?
[05:49:16.949 --> 05:49:23.112]  The point, of course, is that Trump is accused of rape by someone who, in this case, is anonymous.
[05:49:23.212 --> 05:49:24.793]  By phantoms, Bill Clinton is settled.
[05:49:25.553 --> 05:49:34.178]  Well, Bill Clinton settled an $850,000 settlement for exposing himself and demanding oral sex from Paula Jones.
[05:49:35.398 --> 05:49:41.142]  The women who have filed this lawsuit against Trump do not exist.
[05:49:41.762 --> 05:49:44.084]  This is a fraud, this whole lawsuit.
[05:49:44.104 --> 05:49:54.150]  How do you file stuff with the victim is a Joe, the witness is a Joe, and that witness has someone that never saw it but they told about it as a Joe, 22 years ago.
[05:49:54.250 --> 05:49:56.212]  Isn't there a statute of limitations?
[05:49:57.152 --> 05:50:19.819]  Look, I'm not an attorney, but I have interviewed all of the attorneys for the victims of Epstein who have not settled and are seeking to overturn his slap-on-the-wrist sentence because they were never informed that he was given a sweetheart deal as required by the federal law.
[05:50:20.339 --> 05:50:21.520]  They know Bill's
[05:50:22.585 --> 05:50:25.106]  The relationship with Epstein is problematic.
[05:50:25.646 --> 05:50:35.449]  They know that there's a testimony in civil trial that Epstein was videotaping his VIP guests when they were partying with underage girls.
[05:50:35.969 --> 05:50:46.472]  So one has to wonder whether Epstein, who's gotten a total pass on the violent rape of 33 children, has something on higher-ups.
[05:50:47.807 --> 05:50:51.150]  Obviously he's framing him on the plane, Clinton, 24 times.
[05:50:51.470 --> 05:50:53.491]  By the way, we checked New York and I thought it was 10 years.
[05:50:53.751 --> 05:50:55.573]  In some states, Texas is 10, the last time I checked.
[05:50:56.193 --> 05:51:01.377]  Rape of a minor, or rape period, is 5 years in New York.
[05:51:01.977 --> 05:51:11.824]  So how in the hell, if it's 22 years, are they filing civil suits, when criminal doesn't even cover it, in New York, for 5 years, when it's 22?
[05:51:11.924 --> 05:51:13.705]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[05:51:14.093 --> 05:51:15.755]  Well, it's because it's not a real lawsuit.
[05:51:15.795 --> 05:51:18.298]  It only has to survive for three more weeks.
[05:51:18.458 --> 05:51:18.978]  Exactly.
[05:51:19.018 --> 05:51:22.482]  That's why they launched it so early, so close to it, so one can prove it either way.
[05:51:23.283 --> 05:51:25.866]  Well, it's meant to divert.
[05:51:25.906 --> 05:51:27.547]  So do I follow suit that Bill Clinton raped me?
[05:51:28.407 --> 05:51:32.449]  Should I just say you raped me in a parking lot, picked some day I was in Austin, file an affidavit?
[05:51:32.469 --> 05:51:41.394]  I'm not going to do that, but I'll just say Bill Clinton and Hillary both raped me at a quality inn, or a Best Western, you know, with like, frickin' Easter Bunnies.
[05:51:41.494 --> 05:51:42.615]  I mean, you know, what do I do?
[05:51:42.935 --> 05:51:49.558]  What's the difference between the lawsuit that was filed in Texas and was immediately thrown out by a right-headed, a right-thinking judge?
[05:51:50.379 --> 05:51:50.919]  A fake name.
[05:51:51.079 --> 05:51:52.060]  It had a fake name on it.
[05:51:52.880 --> 05:51:53.741]  Yeah, they all do.
[05:51:54.021 --> 05:51:55.181]  These people don't exist.
[05:51:55.742 --> 05:51:57.223]  And if they do exist,
[05:51:58.203 --> 05:52:00.550]  Come forward and make your charge in public.
[05:52:00.610 --> 05:52:01.332]  None of this innuendo.
[05:52:01.452 --> 05:52:03.758]  Oh, if there's some woman's got proof, come on my show.
[05:52:03.778 --> 05:52:04.801]  I'll turn against Trump right now.
[05:52:05.834 --> 05:52:12.817]  Well, and you also have some woman, Jill Hearth, who is evidently married to some Trump friend or executive.
[05:52:12.857 --> 05:52:17.519]  She's come forward and claimed that Trump assaulted her, but she's told four different stories.
[05:52:17.980 --> 05:52:20.761]  This appears also to be politically motivated.
[05:52:20.841 --> 05:52:26.524]  Now, there's only one rapist on the scene in this presidential campaign, and it's Bill Clinton.
[05:52:26.584 --> 05:52:26.924]  That's right.
[05:52:26.944 --> 05:52:29.645]  So clearly, they knew that was a strong suit.
[05:52:29.725 --> 05:52:30.766]  You advised Trump to do it.
[05:52:30.786 --> 05:52:31.566]  He took the high road.
[05:52:31.606 --> 05:52:32.046]  They didn't.
[05:52:32.466 --> 05:52:34.487]  And in the time being, they turned it around against him.
[05:52:34.587 --> 05:52:35.268]  I mean, my God.
[05:52:36.289 --> 05:52:39.552]  And look, they have planned it for some time.
[05:52:39.692 --> 05:52:40.893]  I think that's pretty clear.
[05:52:40.913 --> 05:52:42.134]  You said, we gotta find the club.
[05:52:42.174 --> 05:52:42.874]  It was a little viral.
[05:52:43.114 --> 05:52:43.955]  It was like a year ago.
[05:52:43.975 --> 05:52:45.236]  It was like your fifth or sixth interview.
[05:52:45.596 --> 05:52:46.797]  You went into all this.
[05:52:47.378 --> 05:52:50.340]  Epstein, the plane, the fake Texas thing.
[05:52:50.360 --> 05:52:53.042]  You know, right when it happened, it's gonna come up.
[05:52:53.062 --> 05:52:54.583]  They're gonna bring it up right before the election.
[05:52:54.603 --> 05:52:56.605]  I mean, Roger, again, you said it all.
[05:52:56.625 --> 05:52:57.626]  And it happened.
[05:52:57.726 --> 05:52:58.687]  I mean, you predicted it.
[05:52:59.482 --> 05:53:12.755]  Well, again, an MSNBC reporter tonight tells me, when I raised the question of Bill Clinton riding on the pedophile's plane 27 times, according to FAA records, she says, Trump was on Epstein's plane.
[05:53:13.195 --> 05:53:20.602]  Now, I researched the Epstein issue extensively for my book, Clinton's War on Women, which you can get at the Infowars.com store.
[05:53:21.923 --> 05:53:25.025]  Donald Trump was never on Epstein's plane.
[05:53:25.105 --> 05:53:33.130]  No manifest, which is required by federal law, shows Trump ever traveling anywhere with Epstein on Epstein's plane.
[05:53:33.170 --> 05:53:40.094]  You talked a year ago about Trump next to his golf course, was invited to a party, he goes, there's young girls at a pool, he gets the hell out of there.
[05:53:40.754 --> 05:53:47.879]  Well, actually the first thing he does, he says to his bodyguard, how nice, Jeffrey lets the neighborhood children use his pool.
[05:53:49.090 --> 05:53:58.092]  Then once he gets into the party, he looks around, he becomes increasingly uncomfortable because all the women there are not really women, they're girls.
[05:53:58.472 --> 05:53:59.593]  There's a handful of men.
[05:53:59.693 --> 05:54:02.073]  So he pays his respects and he leaves.
[05:54:02.574 --> 05:54:03.614]  This is a smear.
[05:54:04.214 --> 05:54:09.375]  It's meant to... And by the way, I don't want to get into our lifestyles or what we... The point is, you know Trump.
[05:54:09.435 --> 05:54:11.396]  He likes bombshell superwomen.
[05:54:12.156 --> 05:54:13.536]  You know, he wants Meryl Monroe.
[05:54:13.576 --> 05:54:16.777]  He's not looking for, like, Clinton, some 14-year-old girl.
[05:54:16.837 --> 05:54:18.038]  There's never been a history of that.
[05:54:18.358 --> 05:54:19.258]  Clinton has that.
[05:54:20.298 --> 05:54:33.402]  Well, another interesting thing is that many in the mainstream media have been trying to push a rumor that the Trumps, Donald and his wife Melania, are separated.
[05:54:33.422 --> 05:54:36.043]  That Melania is no longer supportive.
[05:54:36.783 --> 05:54:38.404]  Did you see her at the debate tonight?
[05:54:38.524 --> 05:54:39.324]  She was glowing.
[05:54:39.983 --> 05:54:40.704]  Oh, she looks great.
[05:54:40.764 --> 05:54:41.764]  She's totally behind him.
[05:54:42.225 --> 05:54:43.385]  So let me ask you this.
[05:54:43.766 --> 05:54:46.027]  This is a referendum on mainstream media and their hoaxes.
[05:54:46.347 --> 05:54:47.528]  They've been caught over and over again.
[05:54:47.548 --> 05:54:50.430]  They tried to create a stampede, a stereo that he was dropping out.
[05:54:50.690 --> 05:54:51.771]  They've done this three other times.
[05:54:52.372 --> 05:54:53.112]  It isn't working.
[05:54:53.593 --> 05:54:54.873]  We've got 28 days.
[05:54:54.893 --> 05:54:57.775]  I mean, it's 29 right now, but two hours central.
[05:54:58.356 --> 05:55:01.258]  We're talking 28 days in a few minutes.
[05:55:01.338 --> 05:55:02.459]  What do you expect the next?
[05:55:02.479 --> 05:55:04.960]  Because you've been totally like an oracle on what's happening.
[05:55:05.040 --> 05:55:05.761]  What happens next?
[05:55:06.481 --> 05:55:08.263]  Well, first of all, I'd like to make two points.
[05:55:09.033 --> 05:55:16.019]  Anderson Cooper interprets the locker room chat with Billy Bush as sexual assault.
[05:55:17.260 --> 05:55:19.742]  Does he ask Hillary about her husband's sexual assault?
[05:55:19.763 --> 05:55:22.185]  He said these girls like me so much I could grab them.
[05:55:22.645 --> 05:55:23.326]  He didn't say that.
[05:55:24.540 --> 05:55:26.582]  And then Martha Raddatz.
[05:55:26.662 --> 05:55:27.663]  Martha, look, simple.
[05:55:28.124 --> 05:55:29.625]  Stop pretending to be a journalist.
[05:55:29.685 --> 05:55:33.729]  Just become a paid spokesman for the Clintons or for the Democratic National Committee.
[05:55:33.749 --> 05:55:38.434]  But she interrupts Trump constantly, but she never interrupts Hillary.
[05:55:39.375 --> 05:55:40.136]  Pathetic, really.
[05:55:40.156 --> 05:55:42.798]  And did you love Trump finally pointing out that we're interrupting him and on her?
[05:55:44.020 --> 05:55:44.660]  Yeah, exactly.
[05:55:44.740 --> 05:55:47.782]  So, I mean, look, they exposed themselves by their behavior.
[05:55:48.662 --> 05:55:57.327]  I can't tell you where this goes, because I've got to go work the phones tonight, but I can tell you Trump really scored tonight, in my view.
[05:55:57.847 --> 05:55:58.187]  He's back.
[05:55:58.207 --> 05:56:01.229]  So would you give him a B+, A-, A-, A-?
[05:56:01.389 --> 05:56:05.571]  I'd actually give him an A. I'd give him an A. I think he was on his game.
[05:56:06.251 --> 05:56:10.253]  Look, he's Trumpian, and he talks in Trump speech patterns.
[05:56:10.273 --> 05:56:11.054]  I'd say A+.
[05:56:11.234 --> 05:56:12.614]  I'm really impressed.
[05:56:14.798 --> 05:56:19.165]  I recognize he's not a polished career politician, unlike Hillary.
[05:56:19.225 --> 05:56:25.536]  He hasn't memorized words that were designed and tested in polls.
[05:56:25.836 --> 05:56:26.317]  Exactly.
[05:56:26.357 --> 05:56:27.258]  He's not a politician.
[05:56:27.298 --> 05:56:28.360]  Shouldn't he go on then?
[05:56:30.009 --> 05:56:32.430]  Well, I think he's certainly now in position to do so.
[05:56:32.450 --> 05:56:33.770]  I mean, I think it is interesting
[05:56:51.935 --> 05:56:55.997]  That he both showed that he could handle the nuance of complicated issues.
[05:56:56.898 --> 05:57:00.220]  On the tax code question, I guess this is my greatest objection.
[05:57:00.900 --> 05:57:01.700]  Anderson Cooper.
[05:57:02.641 --> 05:57:03.922]  Not tax avoidance.
[05:57:04.702 --> 05:57:07.984]  Everything Trump did was 100% legal.
[05:57:08.944 --> 05:57:10.705]  I don't want- And I read his tweets.
[05:57:10.745 --> 05:57:12.466]  He goes, this is a scam.
[05:57:12.727 --> 05:57:14.588]  We need to change it, but I have to compete.
[05:57:14.748 --> 05:57:16.128]  I'm doing it while it's this way.
[05:57:17.129 --> 05:57:18.490]  Well, I don't want a president.
[05:57:19.643 --> 05:57:23.645]  Who pays more than he owes in federal taxes under the current code.
[05:57:24.025 --> 05:57:26.606]  That person would be too stupid to be president.
[05:57:27.166 --> 05:57:27.886]  No, no, exactly.
[05:57:27.926 --> 05:57:28.247]  All right.
[05:57:28.787 --> 05:57:30.427]  Roger, obviously tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[05:57:30.447 --> 05:57:31.888]  to 3 p.m., the big daytime show.
[05:57:31.908 --> 05:57:32.508]  We've got to have you back.
[05:57:32.528 --> 05:57:33.048]  This is epic.
[05:57:33.068 --> 05:57:34.489]  But I am very pleased.
[05:57:34.529 --> 05:57:37.890]  Were you not panicking the first five, ten minutes, though, when he was taking the attacks?
[05:57:37.970 --> 05:57:43.012]  Or did you get that he was just letting her pile on so he wouldn't look like he was an aggressor?
[05:57:43.032 --> 05:57:46.254]  He did it very judo, very nuanced.
[05:57:47.054 --> 05:57:56.238]  Well, in all honesty, in the first few minutes, I was so busy fielding congratulatory calls when there was no handshake, precisely as I predicted.
[05:57:56.658 --> 05:57:58.819]  She refused to shake his hand up front.
[05:57:58.859 --> 05:58:00.160]  By the way, let's talk about that.
[05:58:00.280 --> 05:58:01.901]  You were told by a source it wouldn't happen.
[05:58:01.941 --> 05:58:03.442]  They always shake hands before a debate.
[05:58:03.742 --> 05:58:04.682]  You've been proven correct.
[05:58:04.702 --> 05:58:05.623]  We should have had that first.
[05:58:06.723 --> 05:58:09.204]  They kind of went like this, and you notice he didn't do it.
[05:58:09.264 --> 05:58:10.585]  She figured out it wasn't going to happen.
[05:58:10.885 --> 05:58:14.447]  I guess we did it too early, an hour and a half before she got the word, didn't she?
[05:58:14.487 --> 05:58:15.007]  Talk about that.
[05:58:15.347 --> 05:58:26.614]  Well, I don't think they changed their plan, but he was tipped off, and Anderson Cooper then going to her and saying, why didn't you shake his hand, would have been too obvious after we exposed him.
[05:58:26.694 --> 05:58:31.057]  Sure, so they have the next lady come in about children, so he could do what you did with children.
[05:58:31.097 --> 05:58:31.938]  That was so scripted.
[05:58:32.438 --> 05:58:34.820]  Yeah, look, this is the one I love the most.
[05:58:34.900 --> 05:58:36.582]  She's an advocate for children?
[05:58:36.602 --> 05:58:47.591]  How about the 18 children under the age of 8 who died at Waco when she, she, the co-president... All the children whose fathers are killed because they want to be suicide bombers by the tens of thousands.
[05:58:47.631 --> 05:58:49.272]  So, but I mean, let's talk about that though.
[05:58:49.373 --> 05:58:50.453]  They always shake hands.
[05:58:50.774 --> 05:58:51.574]  It always happens.
[05:58:51.935 --> 05:58:53.056]  You said, epically,
[05:58:53.456 --> 05:58:56.139]  That she was going to try to shake and she would say no.
[05:58:56.479 --> 05:58:57.120]  He held back.
[05:58:57.140 --> 05:58:59.142]  We ought to cue that back up if you can at the top of the debate.
[05:58:59.562 --> 05:59:00.643]  We have it on DVR in there.
[05:59:00.924 --> 05:59:02.165]  You were proven right.
[05:59:02.485 --> 05:59:04.107]  So I know you warned him.
[05:59:04.247 --> 05:59:04.847]  Others warned him.
[05:59:04.867 --> 05:59:05.668]  You got it from a source.
[05:59:06.349 --> 05:59:08.531]  They kind of sit there and come close and don't do it.
[05:59:08.591 --> 05:59:11.374]  I guess he didn't reach out so she didn't do the refusal.
[05:59:11.674 --> 05:59:12.275]  This was epic.
[05:59:12.315 --> 05:59:12.936]  You were proven right.
[05:59:13.536 --> 05:59:18.680]  Well, and right now the folks in the Clinton campaign are desperately trying to figure out who the spy is.
[05:59:18.700 --> 05:59:21.403]  I think it was Napoleon who said spies are everything.
[05:59:21.903 --> 05:59:29.229]  There's somebody in their campaign who isn't really for Hillary, and they're a source of, in this case, solid intelligence.
[05:59:30.010 --> 05:59:32.311]  And I suspect they'll be a source of more.
[05:59:33.257 --> 05:59:35.038]  Yeah, Fortune saying they didn't shake hands.
[05:59:35.118 --> 05:59:35.818]  It's unprecedented.
[05:59:35.858 --> 05:59:37.379]  Well, I have another source.
[05:59:37.439 --> 05:59:38.119]  You have a source.
[05:59:38.579 --> 05:59:39.780]  I have a Secret Service source.
[05:59:39.800 --> 05:59:40.740]  I have other sources.
[05:59:41.340 --> 05:59:47.102]  And I asked when I met with this person in private to give the dossier we covered today that you could confirm parts of.
[05:59:47.563 --> 05:59:49.843]  So I double-checked it with you yesterday and this morning.
[05:59:50.364 --> 05:59:52.004]  But listen, I get it.
[05:59:52.284 --> 05:59:53.165]  She's not a liberal.
[05:59:54.165 --> 05:59:55.386]  She wants war with Russia.
[05:59:55.446 --> 05:59:56.306]  She's dangerous.
[05:59:56.727 --> 05:59:57.607]  We're scared of her.
[05:59:57.927 --> 05:59:58.968]  The Secret Service is too.
[05:59:59.008 --> 06:00:00.749]  The screaming, the yelling, the fit-throwing.
[06:00:01.290 --> 06:00:03.031]  Much of her inner circle is scared of her.
[06:00:03.651 --> 06:00:06.153]  And why don't they just expose her and this could stop?
[06:00:06.213 --> 06:00:11.576]  I mean, you know, someone that is this crazy, like General Flynn said, should not be in command.
[06:00:12.176 --> 06:00:14.158]  Well, the problem is, of course, they can't expose her.
[06:00:14.258 --> 06:00:17.480]  This former agent Gary Byrne wrote a terrific book.
[06:00:17.500 --> 06:00:18.200]  Had him on twice.
[06:00:18.941 --> 06:00:20.682]  Have you seen him on CBS, NBC, CNN?
[06:00:22.603 --> 06:00:29.126]  In fact, when he even gets an inquiry about an interview, Clinton shut it down immediately.
[06:00:29.426 --> 06:00:35.689]  See, censorship and bully boy tactics, this is the hallmark of the Clinton thugs.
[06:00:35.749 --> 06:00:36.869]  They're bullies.
[06:00:36.970 --> 06:00:38.530]  They want to censor people.
[06:00:38.590 --> 06:00:39.871]  They want to threaten people.
[06:00:39.891 --> 06:00:46.534]  You know, they have hundreds of these bots attacking you and I and anyone who stands up for Trump.
[06:00:46.994 --> 06:00:49.816]  It's laughable because it's so transparent.
[06:00:50.696 --> 06:00:52.658]  You can see the flop squat tonight.
[06:00:53.078 --> 06:00:54.419]  It's catching up with Hillary.
[06:00:54.839 --> 06:00:55.600]  Her record?
[06:00:56.080 --> 06:00:57.701]  Alex, she has no record.
[06:00:58.181 --> 06:01:02.924]  Everything she has touched in her political and public career has proved crap.
[06:01:04.215 --> 06:01:05.296]  No, total crap.
[06:01:05.376 --> 06:01:10.039]  Listen, Roger, everybody knows, I told it like it was, not very good two weeks ago.
[06:01:10.099 --> 06:01:10.800]  This was epic.
[06:01:11.300 --> 06:01:22.388]  My son, Rex Jones, is watching right now at 14 with my daughters, and I just want to say, son, I'm going to go back to Roger Stone here in closing, but son, I'm going to turn it over to Leah McAdoo and the rest of the crew for two hours.
[06:01:22.888 --> 06:01:25.590]  They're here tonight to take your phone calls, cover the news, you name it.
[06:01:25.630 --> 06:01:26.951]  I'm going to get out of here.
[06:01:26.971 --> 06:01:27.532]  I'll take over.
[06:01:28.573 --> 06:01:30.413]  I don't want to do this fight, but I have to.
[06:01:30.474 --> 06:01:31.474]  I can't give in to evil.
[06:01:31.554 --> 06:01:32.694]  I can't roll over to tyranny.
[06:01:32.794 --> 06:01:33.554]  I do this for you.
[06:01:33.694 --> 06:01:34.194]  I love you.
[06:01:34.234 --> 06:01:35.415]  Whatever happens is for you.
[06:01:35.435 --> 06:01:42.657]  And I'm so proud to want to carry on my footsteps to you, Rex Jones, and to you, my darlings, my little girls watching.
[06:01:42.697 --> 06:01:44.237]  I'd say your names when there's enemies watching.
[06:01:44.677 --> 06:01:45.537]  I love you so much.
[06:01:45.717 --> 06:01:47.038]  And your daddy does this.
[06:01:48.157 --> 06:01:49.718]  Could have been sold out to these people years ago.
[06:01:49.738 --> 06:01:53.639]  I was offered $3 million and $10 million a year without even having a crew.
[06:01:53.659 --> 06:01:55.520]  There's more money I make now to sell it.
[06:01:55.540 --> 06:01:59.021]  I didn't do it because I love you and I want to make America great.
[06:01:59.041 --> 06:02:00.002]  I want to make America free.
[06:02:00.022 --> 06:02:03.683]  I want to be with other people like Roger Stone and others that care about freedom.
[06:02:03.703 --> 06:02:04.623]  So I love you tonight.
[06:02:04.683 --> 06:02:05.284]  Watch it at home.
[06:02:05.664 --> 06:02:07.965]  I'm going to end this in a few minutes and let the crew come in and take over.
[06:02:07.985 --> 06:02:08.925]  I'm going to drive home to you.
[06:02:08.945 --> 06:02:10.185]  I'm going to put you in bed.
[06:02:10.786 --> 06:02:12.326]  It's Columbus State tomorrow, so you're off tomorrow.
[06:02:12.346 --> 06:02:13.647]  We're going to get off on the radio.
[06:02:13.667 --> 06:02:14.687]  We're going to go to the Greenbelt.
[06:02:14.767 --> 06:02:15.848]  We're going to go have fun tomorrow.
[06:02:15.868 --> 06:02:16.648]  We're going to ride horses.
[06:02:17.268 --> 06:02:21.832]  I love you so much, and I do all this, and all those people attack you at school because I'm your daddy.
[06:02:21.852 --> 06:02:25.615]  A lot of people love you, but a lot of people attack me because I'm your daddy, because I'm willing to stand up for you.
[06:02:26.116 --> 06:02:29.499]  And I'm so proud of you, and what you do, and the fact that you see through it all, and I love you.
[06:02:30.179 --> 06:02:32.341]  Roger Stone, you lost your mom a few months ago.
[06:02:32.361 --> 06:02:39.207]  You've been through a lot of hell, but you've talked about the four campaigns you've been internally in the White House, nine campaigns total.
[06:02:39.287 --> 06:02:42.169]  Is this not the most historical thing we've ever seen?
[06:02:42.470 --> 06:02:43.591]  Two minutes closing comment.
[06:02:44.738 --> 06:02:47.280]  Yes, Alex, because this isn't a political campaign.
[06:02:47.820 --> 06:02:48.981]  It's an insurgency.
[06:02:49.782 --> 06:02:50.863]  It's an uprising.
[06:02:51.723 --> 06:03:01.031]  It's a revolt of the people against the two-party duopoly and the people who want to steal our freedom who have nothing but a record of failure.
[06:03:01.591 --> 06:03:12.660]  It's a revolt against endless war and the erosion of our civil liberties, the massive debt and spending and borrowing, the bailouts for the crooks on Wall Street,
[06:03:13.200 --> 06:03:20.184]  Well, the globalists are importing our jobs abroad, and our foreign policy seems to have... That's my next question.
[06:03:20.564 --> 06:03:21.945]  You've been inside the system.
[06:03:21.985 --> 06:03:22.825]  Nixon wasn't perfect.
[06:03:23.185 --> 06:03:23.866]  Reagan wasn't perfect.
[06:03:23.886 --> 06:03:24.706]  They weren't out to get the country.
[06:03:25.687 --> 06:03:27.588]  Why are the globalists out to get us?
[06:03:27.628 --> 06:03:29.209]  Why do they do deals that always hurt us?
[06:03:29.609 --> 06:03:30.870]  Why do they call us bitter claimants?
[06:03:31.230 --> 06:03:35.132]  Why do they call Bernie Sanders people, you know, basement dwellers when they did this to us?
[06:03:35.252 --> 06:03:36.273]  Why are they out to get us?
[06:03:37.193 --> 06:03:38.814]  Because they're elitists.
[06:03:39.615 --> 06:03:44.019]  And in the past, they didn't have to worry because the people were not yet onto them.
[06:03:44.759 --> 06:03:46.141]  That's why you were able to have
[06:03:47.401 --> 06:03:50.323]  Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama.
[06:03:50.804 --> 06:04:06.495]  But now, the great American people are awakened, and they see that their policies have failed, and that we're moving towards world government, and they see the people pulling the strings, and they're turning to a man who has the stature
[06:04:07.396 --> 06:04:11.841]  In the independence, in the courage to take them on.
[06:04:12.041 --> 06:04:13.984]  And they're crapping their pants.
[06:04:14.044 --> 06:04:14.424]  That's right.
[06:04:14.444 --> 06:04:15.165]  StoneColdTruth.com.
[06:04:15.205 --> 06:04:17.548]  In closing then, I'm going to bring the rest of the crew and I'm ending this.
[06:04:17.808 --> 06:04:21.412]  We're going to take calls for at least an hour and a half and talk to the viewers out there and cover highlights.
[06:04:21.552 --> 06:04:22.573]  EpicNightInfoWars.com.
[06:04:24.451 --> 06:04:25.712]  Trump, I know, isn't perfect.
[06:04:25.792 --> 06:04:26.833]  I'm not perfect, my God.
[06:04:26.873 --> 06:04:28.514]  If you're a real man, you're not.
[06:04:28.534 --> 06:04:29.034]  You're an animal.
[06:04:29.735 --> 06:04:31.896]  The difference is he doesn't have a bad heart towards people.
[06:04:31.936 --> 06:04:32.777]  He isn't out to get us.
[06:04:32.817 --> 06:04:34.738]  He is pissed about us having one-sided deals.
[06:04:35.218 --> 06:04:36.079]  He's not out to get America.
[06:04:36.099 --> 06:04:38.500]  That's why the elites and all their emails and internal stuff are panicking.
[06:04:38.801 --> 06:04:42.103]  They've sold out our greatness and lied to themselves that their greatness was us.
[06:04:42.523 --> 06:04:44.404]  Trump realizes the greatness is the Republic.
[06:04:44.424 --> 06:04:45.625]  It's been the apple of the eye.
[06:04:46.206 --> 06:04:47.987]  Talk for two minutes, then we'll close this out.
[06:04:48.507 --> 06:04:54.617]  Who, and I know you don't brag about it, but you've known Trump for decades, 40 years, really hung out with him a lot, been a wingman for him when he's divorced and stuff.
[06:04:55.980 --> 06:05:01.348]  What makes Trump tick, and why is he taking this epic challenge on, and why are the elite so afraid of him?
[06:05:02.355 --> 06:05:06.879]  You know, I go back, Alex, to an interview he gave many years ago with Oprah Winfrey.
[06:05:07.020 --> 06:05:11.123]  And she said to him, Donald, do you think you'd ever run for public office?
[06:05:11.484 --> 06:05:13.025]  Do you think you'd ever run for president?
[06:05:13.065 --> 06:05:14.607]  And he said, no, I don't think so.
[06:05:15.668 --> 06:05:18.390]  Unless things get so bad that I have no choice.
[06:05:19.707 --> 06:05:20.847]  That's where we are today.
[06:05:21.547 --> 06:05:23.808]  Donald Trump has the greatest life in the world.
[06:05:24.328 --> 06:05:26.148]  He has a beautiful family that he loves.
[06:05:26.548 --> 06:05:29.409]  He has a palatial home in Florida and in New York.
[06:05:29.849 --> 06:05:31.169]  He loves to play golf.
[06:05:32.170 --> 06:05:35.250]  There's no more mountains to climb in his real estate company.
[06:05:35.270 --> 06:05:38.931]  He has achieved great wealth and landmark properties.
[06:05:39.551 --> 06:05:42.672]  He's widely respected in his chosen business.
[06:05:43.905 --> 06:05:50.488]  He's been on a golf course in months because he's dedicating himself to a fight to save his country.
[06:05:51.108 --> 06:05:53.949]  He doesn't need to be president to be somebody.
[06:05:54.369 --> 06:06:01.112]  He doesn't need to be president so he can steal, which is why the Clintons have pursued public office.
[06:06:01.972 --> 06:06:04.113]  He's doing this because he loves his country.
[06:06:04.133 --> 06:06:04.653]  That's right.
[06:06:04.673 --> 06:06:06.993]  They were never anything until they got into politics.
[06:06:07.333 --> 06:06:08.234]  He's the opposite.
[06:06:08.594 --> 06:06:09.654]  It's what they hate.
[06:06:10.174 --> 06:06:12.295]  And he doesn't mind wealth in the average person.
[06:06:12.335 --> 06:06:13.435]  He wants to make us wealthy.
[06:06:13.815 --> 06:06:15.275]  They're pissing on the Renaissance.
[06:06:15.655 --> 06:06:17.036]  Donald Trump is the Renaissance.
[06:06:17.376 --> 06:06:18.316]  They're the dark age.
[06:06:18.656 --> 06:06:19.476]  They're the past.
[06:06:19.796 --> 06:06:20.496]  He is the future.
[06:06:20.516 --> 06:06:22.117]  I mean, why do they fear him so much?
[06:06:23.373 --> 06:06:25.034]  They fear him because he can't be bought.
[06:06:25.314 --> 06:06:39.621]  You see, even in the case of the great Ronald Reagan, who I think may have been the greatest president in my lifetime, it was my great privilege to work for him in three presidential campaigns, giving me the opportunity to spend a substantial amount of time with him.
[06:06:40.521 --> 06:06:46.124]  But even his presidency, to a certain extent, was co-opted because what happens is once you get elected,
[06:06:47.060 --> 06:06:54.266]  The professional politicians and the people who believe that they were born to govern show up and say, this is all too complicated for you.
[06:06:54.407 --> 06:06:55.788]  We know how Washington works.
[06:06:56.228 --> 06:06:57.189]  Let us help you.
[06:06:57.369 --> 06:06:59.591]  Meaning, let us undo your policies.
[06:07:00.232 --> 06:07:01.773]  Trump is too smart for that.
[06:07:02.694 --> 06:07:04.275]  He's going to build the wall.
[06:07:04.555 --> 06:07:06.457]  He's going to secure our borders.
[06:07:06.777 --> 06:07:09.280]  He's going to revitalize our economy.
[06:07:09.720 --> 06:07:12.643]  He is going to bring hope back to the inner cities.
[06:07:14.623 --> 06:07:24.913]  He wants to be the hero, which is normal in a real man, and they're totally panicking because the arrogance of these elites that they know everything, they can't ever build anything.
[06:07:24.933 --> 06:07:28.176]  They just sit in little groups and tell you you've got to submit to them.
[06:07:28.416 --> 06:07:29.297]  I've had them come to me and say,
[06:07:29.537 --> 06:07:31.058]  We're going to give you $10 million a year.
[06:07:31.098 --> 06:07:31.499]  Join us.
[06:07:31.539 --> 06:07:32.980]  They're like, you can't believe we're not taking it.
[06:07:33.000 --> 06:07:34.542]  I'm like, I'm going to build my own thing.
[06:07:35.022 --> 06:07:36.904]  Well, Roger Stone is an epic time to be alive.
[06:07:36.924 --> 06:07:37.945]  StoneColdTruth.com.
[06:07:38.305 --> 06:07:41.448]  We've got, did you see the thousands of posters they hung up?
[06:07:41.468 --> 06:07:44.190]  Bill Clinton's a rapist outside of the deal.
[06:07:44.671 --> 06:07:46.492]  It's now been 16 confrontations.
[06:07:46.532 --> 06:07:48.874]  I'm told there were three more tonight on national TV.
[06:07:48.894 --> 06:07:49.735]  We'll have those tomorrow.
[06:07:50.096 --> 06:07:52.498]  Infowars.com, DredgeReport.com is linking to that.
[06:07:53.399 --> 06:07:57.884]  I mean, I had no idea we had this idea a week and a half ago to say, you know, Bill Clinton, right, go take over.
[06:07:57.924 --> 06:07:59.165]  We're just tired of them blocking that.
[06:07:59.646 --> 06:08:02.169]  I'm telling you, they're seeing the power of humanity.
[06:08:02.529 --> 06:08:03.611]  60 seconds, closing comment.
[06:08:04.842 --> 06:08:14.325]  Look, as I said earlier, I'm very proud that the guerrilla tactic of making the Clinton rape t-shirt is working.
[06:08:15.005 --> 06:08:18.246]  Coming up next is the official Bill Clinton Rape Whistle.
[06:08:18.646 --> 06:08:23.188]  It's another way to go around the mainstream media in the giant public appearances by Bill.
[06:08:23.368 --> 06:08:25.268]  Thousands of people are calling the whistle.
[06:08:26.229 --> 06:08:26.769]  Coming soon.
[06:08:27.628 --> 06:08:28.808]  So take over the microphones.
[06:08:29.209 --> 06:08:31.289]  Stonecoldtruth.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[06:08:31.309 --> 06:08:34.030]  We'll have the rape whistles at cost to get out.
[06:08:34.050 --> 06:08:35.751]  We have the Hillary for President shirt.
[06:08:36.071 --> 06:08:41.812]  It shows how weak they are though, Roger, that you and I and a few others and our listeners can continually dominate the narrative.
[06:08:42.073 --> 06:08:43.073]  They're not that powerful.
[06:08:43.113 --> 06:08:44.173]  They realize they're a facade.
[06:08:44.433 --> 06:08:49.395]  Did you notice in closing that she literally sat down 90% of the time and couldn't even stand up?
[06:08:50.435 --> 06:09:00.058]  Well, she doesn't have the stamina or the fitness, physical fitness in this case, or the mental balance or clarity to be president.
[06:09:00.598 --> 06:09:04.839]  Why is she asking for Parkinson's disease medicine in her emails?
[06:09:05.539 --> 06:09:08.460]  I suspect it's because she has Parkinson's disease.
[06:09:08.720 --> 06:09:12.841]  All right, this is the final closing and I'm going to go to a three minute clip and bring the rest of the crew in.
[06:09:12.861 --> 06:09:13.402]  I'm getting out of here.
[06:09:13.422 --> 06:09:14.302]  I want to do two hours.
[06:09:14.682 --> 06:09:15.022]  Huge.
[06:09:15.122 --> 06:09:27.167]  We have we have via the Infomer stream, YouTube and others, two and a half million people watching right now, not just counting dozens and dozens of AM stations, cable stations, TV stations.
[06:09:27.207 --> 06:09:28.087]  I mean, I don't I don't know the numbers.
[06:09:28.107 --> 06:09:28.747]  Those will come in later.
[06:09:29.047 --> 06:09:30.868]  We have two million people
[06:09:31.528 --> 06:09:34.750]  Plus, conservatively watching outside the system right now.
[06:09:34.770 --> 06:09:37.532]  I'm going to bring in the crew for at least an hour and a half to cover all this.
[06:09:37.572 --> 06:09:38.552]  I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[06:09:38.592 --> 06:09:41.834]  to 3 p.m., but what do they do next?
[06:09:41.894 --> 06:09:43.975]  I mean, the Empire is going to strike back, Roger Stone.
[06:09:43.995 --> 06:09:45.456]  They're not going to just roll over to this.
[06:09:45.917 --> 06:09:51.680]  We're having great victories, but, you know, like the Wolf says in Pulp Fiction, let's not start, you know, what each other's, you know, yet.
[06:09:52.140 --> 06:09:54.522]  So, in your gut, in that great
[06:09:55.578 --> 06:09:59.999]  You know, slash Western European Sicilian brain.
[06:10:00.359 --> 06:10:01.720]  What does the Spidey sense pick up?
[06:10:03.260 --> 06:10:11.262]  I go back once again to the fact is that their fallback plan is to steal this election if they must.
[06:10:12.002 --> 06:10:18.324]  And therefore, if Trump has the kind of late surge that I have believed for a while he could have, I did a
[06:10:19.144 --> 06:10:26.367]  It was very privileged to speak to a breakfast this morning, really a brunch, for the Mount Morris County, New Jersey Republicans.
[06:10:26.447 --> 06:10:34.871]  Big crowd, great turnout, great enthusiasm for Donald Trump, but a lot of dejected Trump supporters, a lot of people who are ready to throw in the towel.
[06:10:34.971 --> 06:10:37.092]  Folks, this is not over.
[06:10:37.252 --> 06:10:38.353]  It's not even close.
[06:10:38.373 --> 06:10:40.234]  Stop buying the mind control, exactly.
[06:10:41.314 --> 06:10:52.983]  And in politics, 30 days is a lifetime, and there are going to be more bombshell revelations about the Clintons, and I'm not speaking solely about WikiLeaks.
[06:10:53.223 --> 06:10:54.484]  No, this week's going to be big.
[06:10:54.544 --> 06:10:56.745]  Are we going to see you here in Austin?
[06:10:57.566 --> 06:11:02.930]  I think relatively soon, because I need some barbecue, so I'm going to come on down.
[06:11:04.053 --> 06:11:06.315]  All right, Roger Stone, StoneColdTruth.com.
[06:11:06.335 --> 06:11:08.217]  Get your Bill Clinton rape shirt right there.
[06:11:08.798 --> 06:11:10.600]  Thank you, Roger, for spending so much time with us today.
[06:11:10.620 --> 06:11:11.140]  I appreciate it.
[06:11:11.821 --> 06:11:12.402]  Great to be here.
[06:11:13.513 --> 06:11:17.657]  All right, this guy's done like five hours today and I did, I worked all day.
[06:11:17.717 --> 06:11:20.681]  I'm not bitching, I'm just, I've got to have some rest or I go crazy.
[06:11:21.622 --> 06:11:30.071]  We're going to bring in Leigh Ann McAdoo, we're going to bring in David Nine, and I want to get McBrain, I want to get all the reporters paraded through here, I want to give the number up, I want two hours of coverage.
[06:11:30.351 --> 06:11:32.974]  We have giant audiences, people want to know what happened tonight.
[06:11:33.374 --> 06:11:34.635]  Send the link, Info Wars.
[06:11:35.765 --> 06:11:47.148]  Because this is an exercise in breaking out of the media control.
[06:11:47.828 --> 06:11:51.069]  It's an exercise in saying, look, we don't have teleprompters.
[06:11:51.869 --> 06:11:52.949]  Oh, Hillary, you threatened me.
[06:11:53.749 --> 06:11:55.130]  Oh, Hillary, you're going to shut me down.
[06:11:55.730 --> 06:11:57.870]  Oh, I just got a threat.
[06:11:58.771 --> 06:11:59.211]  Guess what?
[06:11:59.291 --> 06:11:59.771]  Go to hell.
[06:12:01.631 --> 06:12:03.872]  There's a spiritual moment when you just say,
[06:12:06.872 --> 06:12:07.773]  I'm looking for a fight.
[06:12:07.793 --> 06:12:08.934]  But you know what?
[06:12:08.954 --> 06:12:09.974]  You came to the right place.
[06:12:11.055 --> 06:12:23.964]  And my will and my soul and my ancestors and everything behind me is bigger than that little demonic crone that backs radical Islam-abusing women and wants to bankrupt this country and claims she represents the people.
[06:12:24.465 --> 06:12:25.606]  I want prosperity.
[06:12:26.126 --> 06:12:27.067]  I want a good future.
[06:12:27.147 --> 06:12:29.128]  I don't care what color your skin is.
[06:12:29.188 --> 06:12:30.529]  Your blood is red.
[06:12:31.090 --> 06:12:32.631]  Your heart is big and purple.
[06:12:33.211 --> 06:12:34.692]  Your guts are full of life.
[06:12:35.592 --> 06:12:38.413]  And I stand for everybody who wants liberty and freedom.
[06:12:38.433 --> 06:12:41.294]  We've got Leanne in there in the new TV studio.
[06:12:42.054 --> 06:12:44.135]  We've got David Knight who's welcome to come in whenever he wants.
[06:12:44.155 --> 06:12:46.396]  Leanne, what do you make of that debate?
[06:12:47.116 --> 06:12:48.837]  What do you make of everything that's happening?
[06:12:48.877 --> 06:12:49.657]  What do you think of tonight?
[06:12:50.578 --> 06:13:03.144]  Well, you know, I gotta say, I think the big winner of the debate was the debate fly that kept landing on Hillary Clinton because it sought her out like the big pile of flaming poo garbage that she is.
[06:13:03.184 --> 06:13:05.345]  What is it about flies landing on her and Obama?
[06:13:06.266 --> 06:13:06.726]  I know!
[06:13:06.806 --> 06:13:14.089]  It's like they sense that demonic soul, so they're trying to get back in, you know, to go back to the evil, go back to the poo.
[06:13:14.109 --> 06:13:15.050]  Go back to mommy?
[06:13:16.111 --> 06:13:17.752]  Back to Manny.
[06:13:19.233 --> 06:13:27.640]  So yeah, I think at first I was a little bit, all of us were kind of clutching at the beginning of the debate going, oh, Donald Trump, why is he taking it so easy on her?
[06:13:27.680 --> 06:13:29.802]  Yeah, I was flipping out for 10 minutes, but then he came back.
[06:13:29.862 --> 06:13:30.423]  Wasn't that great?
[06:13:30.703 --> 06:13:32.485]  Yes, I mean, everyone was cheering.
[06:13:32.585 --> 06:13:34.206]  Everyone was like, yes, there it is.
[06:13:34.266 --> 06:13:35.607]  We knew we were wondering if you're going to hit.
[06:13:35.687 --> 06:13:37.849]  At first, I was like, man, they got something on him.
[06:13:37.929 --> 06:13:41.373]  They got something on him for him to just, you know, not really go after her.
[06:13:41.453 --> 06:13:46.577]  But then he just shut her down, kept taking hits every single time.
[06:13:46.877 --> 06:13:49.259]  You could see her face when he would say something.
[06:13:49.320 --> 06:13:50.481]  Sidney Blumenthal, she'd be like.
[06:13:51.403 --> 06:13:53.764]  She kind of sees up and her eyes would get big.
[06:13:54.144 --> 06:14:00.165]  Someone needs to put together a compilation video of every single time Hillary starts to go panic.
[06:14:00.385 --> 06:14:01.485]  Oh no, he's going to put some truth out there.
[06:14:01.505 --> 06:14:03.406]  What did you make of her saying he wasn't against the Iraq war?
[06:14:03.766 --> 06:14:07.627]  We have three clips before the war, three like when it happened.
[06:14:07.647 --> 06:14:08.707]  We have six clips.
[06:14:09.127 --> 06:14:10.067]  There's a bunch after.
[06:14:10.087 --> 06:14:11.787]  I mean, he was against the war.
[06:14:12.067 --> 06:14:13.108]  Why won't they give him credit?
[06:14:13.128 --> 06:14:14.128]  They just go, no you weren't.
[06:14:14.648 --> 06:14:15.649]  Well, here's the thing.
[06:14:15.749 --> 06:14:18.591]  I mean, yeah, they have this video, that, and he's kind of going back and forth.
[06:14:18.771 --> 06:14:19.732]  Who cares?
[06:14:19.792 --> 06:14:21.213]  Donald Trump was a businessman.
[06:14:21.253 --> 06:14:24.496]  He was a celebrity on a television show at the time.
[06:14:24.536 --> 06:14:26.217]  You know, he was in real estate.
[06:14:26.417 --> 06:14:28.819]  Sure, and he voted for it.
[06:14:28.859 --> 06:14:30.300]  But he was against it, you know.
[06:14:30.660 --> 06:14:33.463]  Right, but it's like, yes, he was against it.
[06:14:33.503 --> 06:14:40.528]  He came out, he was against a lot of things, but she just, she even got this smirk on her face, like, play back the tape, you know, like Tim Kaine kept doing.
[06:14:40.568 --> 06:14:43.610]  It's like, dude, he was on the Howard Stern Show.
[06:14:44.741 --> 06:14:50.663]  I mean, why are they using that as like the great place where, well, you said this, so this indicates your entire character.
[06:14:51.103 --> 06:14:52.424]  And I was just so surprised.
[06:14:52.484 --> 06:15:06.969]  I could not believe that they were taking this whole segment about treatment of women and just the fact that Bill Clinton is right there and just the record that he has and the record she has with the way that she's treated women.
[06:15:08.029 --> 06:15:11.213]  I agree with you, I want you to speak to this, because I'm going to punch out and denounce the other studio.
[06:15:11.233 --> 06:15:13.776]  Anybody who wants to come in here and take over, because I just want to dominate, can do it.
[06:15:14.457 --> 06:15:18.482]  Whether it's Rob Do, or Darren McBride, or whoever can take over the main studio thing, but you're in the other studio.
[06:15:18.502 --> 06:15:19.664]  Who can dominate?
[06:15:19.684 --> 06:15:21.626]  But I mean, Leanne, think about it.
[06:15:22.007 --> 06:15:24.410]  I agree, but right out of the gates, that woman go, what about children?
[06:15:24.430 --> 06:15:25.892]  And then, yeah, I knew that was coming.
[06:15:26.292 --> 06:15:30.594]  You were really bad in front of kids and some secret tape shooting your mouth off like you shouldn't.
[06:15:30.614 --> 06:15:32.095]  I mean, he just won demerit.
[06:15:32.295 --> 06:15:33.555]  He's not destroying countries.
[06:15:33.755 --> 06:15:34.916]  He's not funding ISIS.
[06:15:35.176 --> 06:15:36.777]  He's not settling rape cases.
[06:15:37.077 --> 06:15:39.038]  You know, I wouldn't support Trump if he'd done all that.
[06:15:39.338 --> 06:15:40.959]  It's like, yes, I get he's bad.
[06:15:41.019 --> 06:15:43.240]  OK, put Hillary and Bill in prison.
[06:15:43.520 --> 06:15:44.740]  Then I'll say, screw Donald Trump.
[06:15:44.780 --> 06:15:45.521]  Give me a Clint Kennedy.
[06:15:45.541 --> 06:15:46.601]  We'll have the David Knight run.
[06:15:47.041 --> 06:15:52.444]  You know, I mean, this is what I'm talking about, is that it's just so ridiculous, David.
[06:15:53.151 --> 06:15:57.475]  You know, Alex, let me give you a couple of examples about how badly Hillary Clinton lost.
[06:15:57.996 --> 06:16:00.919]  We've got CNN saying... So hold on, you agree with me it was a rout?
[06:16:01.219 --> 06:16:01.960]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[06:16:02.120 --> 06:16:02.441]  Absolutely.
[06:16:02.461 --> 06:16:07.626]  You know, he handled the most difficult question of the night, Alex, was say something nice about Hillary.
[06:16:08.006 --> 06:16:14.633]  And I'm sitting here racking my brain thinking, if I was in his place, I would just come back and say, I'm sorry, I can't think of anything nice.
[06:16:14.733 --> 06:16:17.115]  I don't know what else to say about her.
[06:16:17.195 --> 06:16:18.597]  But he handled it with grace.
[06:16:19.117 --> 06:16:20.919]  And he said, yeah, she just keeps coming.
[06:16:21.239 --> 06:16:22.100]  She's a fighter.
[06:16:22.140 --> 06:16:23.941]  He's very presidential when he's himself.
[06:16:24.081 --> 06:16:30.127]  But let me tell you, Alex, we've got CNN coming out and saying Trump looms behind Hillary during the debate.
[06:16:30.567 --> 06:16:35.512]  Criticizing him, he so dominated the debate, that they want to portray her as a victim.
[06:16:35.572 --> 06:16:37.033]  And look, that thing was set up in a circle.
[06:16:37.053 --> 06:16:37.533]  Yeah, he's a bully.
[06:16:37.553 --> 06:16:39.695]  When he's being crucified, he stood up and won.
[06:16:39.715 --> 06:16:48.002]  It was set up in a circle, and all he did was, you know, it depends on which camera you've got, whether or not he's standing behind her, isn't it, right?
[06:16:48.283 --> 06:16:52.566]  They can come to an angle and put that in and say, oh look, he's standing behind her, he's dominating her.
[06:16:52.927 --> 06:16:57.831]  Listen, if she can't handle something like this, then she's not going to be able to handle Vladimir Putin.
[06:16:58.291 --> 06:16:59.892]  Remember Vladimir Putin?
[06:16:59.912 --> 06:17:00.952]  Exactly, I saw the headline.
[06:17:01.193 --> 06:17:03.834]  He's now bad for staying behind the podium and being respectful.
[06:17:04.694 --> 06:17:08.156]  Remember when Bill Clinton in his debates used to go up and almost run into people?
[06:17:08.456 --> 06:17:12.719]  Yeah, well think about how Vladimir Putin intimidated Angela Merkel.
[06:17:13.399 --> 06:17:15.561]  He knew that she had a phobia about dogs.
[06:17:15.661 --> 06:17:18.062]  And he had a friendly little Labrador Retriever.
[06:17:18.502 --> 06:17:20.884]  And he brought the Labrador Retriever into their first meeting.
[06:17:20.924 --> 06:17:22.125]  It's like, oh, oh, look, he came in.
[06:17:22.205 --> 06:17:23.626]  Oh, oh, don't let the dog in here.
[06:17:23.646 --> 06:17:24.186]  Don't let the dog in.
[06:17:24.406 --> 06:17:25.487]  Guys, you got to get the dog out.
[06:17:25.587 --> 06:17:29.910]  And if you look at those pictures, Angela Merkel absolutely froze with fear.
[06:17:30.491 --> 06:17:33.012]  And you could almost see the delight on Vladimir Putin's face.
[06:17:33.412 --> 06:17:35.174]  If she can't handle Donald Trump,
[06:17:35.854 --> 06:17:40.198]  Uh, getting over, uh, you know, too close to her, uh, on the debate stage or something.
[06:17:40.238 --> 06:17:41.560]  She isn't going to be able to handle that.
[06:17:41.660 --> 06:17:43.001]  And that's why the elites have put her in.
[06:17:43.021 --> 06:17:45.083]  There are strong women, there are strong men.
[06:17:45.463 --> 06:17:47.765]  They want weak people they can control.
[06:17:47.986 --> 06:17:48.946]  Yeah, look at Putin laughing.
[06:17:49.127 --> 06:17:49.707]  We're putting photos.
[06:17:49.987 --> 06:17:51.789]  Merkel is scared of a frickin' lab.
[06:17:51.809 --> 06:17:53.511]  Look at Putin laughing.
[06:17:53.651 --> 06:17:55.793]  I mean, my God, I'll be kissing that lab on the lips.
[06:17:56.113 --> 06:17:58.634]  They should have put the lab in a burka and then she wouldn't have been afraid of it.
[06:17:58.694 --> 06:18:07.558]  Hey, listen, there's one other issue here, Alex, and that is a tweet that was put out by the foreign policy spokesman Jesse Larrick for the Clinton campaign.
[06:18:08.018 --> 06:18:14.461]  He got very upset about Donald Trump saying, hey, if I'd been president, Khan would not have died.
[06:18:14.961 --> 06:18:18.883]  And he said, regarding your claim that Khan would be alive if you were president, go F yourself.
[06:18:19.463 --> 06:18:22.286]  Instead of saying, you're right, we want to have an Iraq war.
[06:18:22.326 --> 06:18:22.686]  Exactly.
[06:18:22.726 --> 06:18:23.888]  They don't know how to deal with it.
[06:18:23.928 --> 06:18:26.911]  It's like that CNN person yelling, pussy, pussy, pussy.
[06:18:27.211 --> 06:18:31.295]  Yeah, they want to say, hey, you know, when you go low, we're going to go high.
[06:18:31.595 --> 06:18:33.297]  Yeah, they went real high on that, didn't they?
[06:18:33.597 --> 06:18:35.459]  They have absolutely nothing to say, Alex.
[06:18:35.820 --> 06:18:37.121]  He totally dominated it.
[06:18:37.261 --> 06:18:38.541]  No, no, I agree, I agree.
[06:18:38.601 --> 06:18:40.462]  Hey, so I'm going to turn this over to you guys.
[06:18:40.842 --> 06:18:42.022]  We've got a bunch of clips to play.
[06:18:42.062 --> 06:18:42.842]  We have highlights.

[06:18:50.164 --> 06:18:51.624]  There'll be like 2-3 million that have watched this.
[06:18:51.964 --> 06:18:52.765]  So go as long as you want.
[06:18:52.785 --> 06:18:54.345]  We've got a whole crew here doing a great job.
[06:18:54.685 --> 06:18:55.765]  Please pray for our crew.
[06:18:56.205 --> 06:18:56.705]  Support them.
[06:18:56.845 --> 06:18:58.826]  We have a very limited staff behind the scenes.
[06:18:59.106 --> 06:19:01.126]  They're working 18 hours a day during this campaign.
[06:19:01.347 --> 06:19:02.007]  They're exhausted.
[06:19:02.027 --> 06:19:02.827]  We're trying to get the money.
[06:19:03.877 --> 06:19:07.520]  To get a backup crew to help them, but I've gone two hours without one plug.
[06:19:07.880 --> 06:19:09.261]  Get a Hillary for Prison shirt.

[06:19:41.834 --> 06:19:43.417]  We got a deep earth crystal source.
[06:19:45.154 --> 06:19:50.396]  Let it go to the DEA in this big laboratory, because they use this for other stuff.
[06:19:50.777 --> 06:19:55.459]  But this is pure 99999 for $29.
[06:19:56.159 --> 06:19:57.900]  Pure, good halogen.

[06:19:59.381 --> 06:20:00.541]  Real iodide's blue.
[06:20:01.902 --> 06:20:02.882]  In the solution, it's red.
[06:20:03.382 --> 06:20:04.463]  On paper, it turns blue, folks.
[06:20:04.683 --> 06:20:06.024]  Mix it with water, see what I'm talking about.
[06:20:06.917 --> 06:20:08.898]  This sucker is amazing.
[06:20:09.019 --> 06:20:12.841]  It blocked out the estrogen mimickers, the bad hormones, the garbage.
[06:20:12.921 --> 06:20:15.403]  It changed, I mean, I went from 280 pounds to 130 pounds.

[06:20:19.866 --> 06:20:20.787]  I'm more virile.
[06:20:20.807 --> 06:20:23.609]  It makes me a super male vitality game changer.
[06:20:23.989 --> 06:20:33.256]  And where could you fund an operation that's not more dedicated, fearless, hardcore, with 14 confrontations in a week and a half of Bill Clinton being a rapist?
[06:20:33.356 --> 06:20:34.436]  Changing the paradigm.

[06:20:50.650 --> 06:20:51.731]  Loved by the experts.
[06:20:52.151 --> 06:20:52.712]  Amazing.
[06:20:52.812 --> 06:20:53.292]  So good.

[06:20:58.014 --> 06:20:58.974]  A very simple plug.

[06:21:08.236 --> 06:21:10.377]  Leigh Ann McAdoo, your comments.
[06:21:10.417 --> 06:21:11.017]  Back to David.
[06:21:11.317 --> 06:21:12.197]  Give the phone numbers out.
[06:21:12.237 --> 06:21:13.098]  Have all the crew in.
[06:21:13.618 --> 06:21:14.498]  Great job, folks.
[06:21:15.626 --> 06:21:16.186]  Thanks, Alex.
[06:21:16.246 --> 06:21:29.295]  Well, I think one of the key takeaways from this debate, Wikileaks tweeted about it almost immediately, was the fact that Hillary Clinton basically confirmed what they were able to leak out regarding those Podesta emails.
[06:21:30.456 --> 06:21:36.140]  When she was asked about it, she said, well, I recall, I think I was talking about Lincoln.
[06:21:36.160 --> 06:21:38.542]  I had just watched a movie about Lincoln.
[06:21:39.002 --> 06:21:51.936]  So she didn't deny and so there WikiLeaks is saying, oh well I guess it's confirmed that what we leaked was the actual emails, the actual speeches, not something that the Russians had altered.
[06:21:52.236 --> 06:21:57.802]  So now that's really going to come back to haunt her when she tries to push this, oh it's the Russians changing the metadata.
[06:21:58.142 --> 06:21:58.983]  And then of course that
[06:21:59.944 --> 06:22:07.929]  Got the best burn of the night from Trump when he said, you know, you lie and then you blame that lie on Lincoln.
[06:22:08.090 --> 06:22:09.070]  Totally outrageous.
[06:22:09.150 --> 06:22:10.571]  You guys have nothing in common.
[06:22:10.651 --> 06:22:15.354]  First of all, his nickname is Honest Abe and you're a liar.
[06:22:15.715 --> 06:22:18.316]  So that was probably one of my favorite takeaways from the night.
[06:22:18.717 --> 06:22:21.619]  But, you know, we saw how she's going there with the boogeyman again.
[06:22:22.439 --> 06:22:34.106]  Saying it's Russia, and she kept hammering that, saying that name, Russia, the Russians, and then talking about how, you know, we don't really need their help.
[06:22:34.506 --> 06:22:40.830]  We need to align with our boots on the ground there in Syria, the people that we have there on the ground, our partner and allies on the ground there.
[06:22:41.150 --> 06:22:41.850]  Who are they?
[06:22:42.211 --> 06:22:47.774]  Who are these moderate rebels that you have armed that have kicked our guys out of Syria?
[06:22:47.834 --> 06:22:50.916]  Basically, they've chanted, death to America, get out!
[06:22:51.776 --> 06:22:54.820]  And also they've defected to ISIS.
[06:22:55.380 --> 06:22:59.725]  So these are the people that Hillary Clinton wants to align with on the ground.
[06:22:59.765 --> 06:23:06.012]  She calls them our partner and allies, but we know behind the scenes she knows exactly who they are because she helped to found ISIS.
[06:23:07.233 --> 06:23:16.487]  You know, but I would just really like to hear what David Knight thinks about a lot of the policy questions that were kind of coming back and forth.
[06:23:16.507 --> 06:23:21.715]  I thought Donald Trump did a really good job at attacking but then pivoting back to the policy.
[06:23:22.341 --> 06:23:22.861]  I agree.
[06:23:22.961 --> 06:23:23.422]  Can you hear me?
[06:23:23.442 --> 06:23:23.962]  Yeah.
[06:23:24.162 --> 06:23:24.622]  Okay, yeah.
[06:23:25.063 --> 06:23:34.428]  When we're talking about the tax issue, she came back and said, oh, I supported significant tax reform because he said, hey, you want to complain about the tax situation?
[06:23:34.448 --> 06:23:36.068]  You want to complain about the deductions that I take?
[06:23:36.489 --> 06:23:41.551]  All of your donors, like George Soros and Warren Buffett, take these same tax donations.
[06:23:41.591 --> 06:23:45.093]  And isn't it interesting that you don't want to do anything about the carry forward on interest?
[06:23:45.113 --> 06:23:45.714]  Why would that be?
[06:23:46.354 --> 06:23:49.015]  And that was a rhetorical question you just left hanging out there.
[06:23:49.035 --> 06:23:53.418]  Of course, that's because it's her Wall Street backers are going to make that case for her.
[06:23:53.478 --> 06:24:07.405]  One of the things that we saw in these released emails that nobody is talking about, because all they want to talk about is what the Bushes linked on behalf of the Clintons about an off-color comment that Trump made about coming after a woman.
[06:24:07.665 --> 06:24:13.169]  So we haven't looked at any of the things that were leaked about the Hillary Clinton emails.
[06:24:13.209 --> 06:24:14.730]  As you point out, she confirmed some of that.
[06:24:15.210 --> 06:24:24.356]  But the reality is that if you go back and you fact check it, Breitbart says no, in fact, she never did support any significant tax reform.
[06:24:24.616 --> 06:24:30.040]  She also directly lied when she said in her tax plan she was going to cut taxes for some people.
[06:24:31.147 --> 06:24:39.416]  You can go back and you can look, even Time Magazine points out that every single bracket of taxpayer will see their taxes go up under Hillary Clinton.
[06:24:40.076 --> 06:24:47.904]  Everyone, from the people making less than $25,000 all the way up to the 1% of the 1%, everyone will see their taxes go up.
[06:24:47.964 --> 06:24:51.728]  As a matter of fact, the poorest will be hit the hardest under Hillary Clinton.
[06:24:52.569 --> 06:25:01.217]  You're going to have people who are making less than $25,000, single taxpayers making less than $25,000 under Donald Trump's plan, would pay zero in taxes.
[06:25:01.717 --> 06:25:03.058]  And they are paying a lot now.
[06:25:03.078 --> 06:25:05.540]  They're paying about $1,000 right now.
[06:25:05.580 --> 06:25:12.066]  They would pay about $4,000 over her term, those people that would pay zero taxes under Donald Trump.
[06:25:12.086 --> 06:25:13.727]  And it goes that way for everyone.
[06:25:13.787 --> 06:25:17.350]  And it's significant for the poorest people and for those of the middle class.
[06:25:17.410 --> 06:25:18.812]  I had somebody tweet back at me and say,
[06:25:19.372 --> 06:25:23.838]  You know, let me explain to you, criticizing me saying, you know, talking about their tax plans.
[06:25:24.138 --> 06:25:28.744]  He says, oh, that doesn't matter because you're going to have to have the Congress sign off on that.
[06:25:29.224 --> 06:25:30.266]  I know that, okay?
[06:25:30.406 --> 06:25:31.007]  We all know that.
[06:25:31.287 --> 06:25:33.830]  But their plans tell us how they're going to govern.
[06:25:34.571 --> 06:25:43.098]  And understand the fact that Ronald Reagan was able to get a massive tax cut through even when he had a Democrat majority that he had to fight in Congress.
[06:25:43.578 --> 06:25:46.360]  If Donald Trump doesn't have that, he could put this plan through.
[06:25:46.380 --> 06:25:53.246]  He has the largest tax cut we have ever seen, larger than the one that JFK did, larger than the one that Ronald Reagan did.
[06:25:53.726 --> 06:25:58.187]  Both of their tax cuts were very, very beneficial to the entire country.
[06:25:58.227 --> 06:26:01.368]  As JFK said, a rising tide lifts all boats.
[06:26:01.508 --> 06:26:03.148]  And he proved it with his tax cuts.
[06:26:03.448 --> 06:26:05.649]  Reagan proved it again with even bigger tax cuts.
[06:26:05.969 --> 06:26:09.890]  And if Donald Trump gets in, everyone is going to pay less taxes.
[06:26:09.950 --> 06:26:14.191]  If Hillary Clinton gets in, everyone is going to pay thousands of dollars more.
[06:26:14.371 --> 06:26:18.872]  Everyone will pay thousands, even the people at the very bottom of the economic ladder.
[06:26:19.540 --> 06:26:24.346]  Right, and when she was pressed on that, you know, are you really not going to raise taxes on the middle class?
[06:26:24.366 --> 06:26:26.067]  She kind of took a second.
[06:26:26.168 --> 06:26:28.951]  She said, well, you know, I'm really going to try to.
[06:26:29.451 --> 06:26:30.152]  That's my plan.
[06:26:30.172 --> 06:26:31.213]  I'm going to hope to stay safe.
[06:26:31.434 --> 06:26:33.476]  That's the second time she's had a Freudian slip, isn't it?
[06:26:33.756 --> 06:26:34.777]  Because she said that once before.
[06:26:34.797 --> 06:26:36.219]  I'm going to raise taxes on the middle class.
[06:26:36.720 --> 06:26:38.762]  She is going to raise taxes on the middle class.
[06:26:38.942 --> 06:26:43.884]  Even liberal publications like Time Magazine say she's going to raise taxes on the middle class.
[06:26:43.904 --> 06:26:50.126]  They try to make out that it's a small tax increase, but you have to understand that it is a trickle-down poverty.
[06:26:50.786 --> 06:26:55.508]  And when you raise taxes on the rich, you know, everybody needs to have their taxes cut.
[06:26:55.568 --> 06:27:03.571]  We need to get rid of the income tax completely, but let's at least give people a little bit of an incentive to work, the ability to enjoy the fruits of their labor.
[06:27:03.631 --> 06:27:05.912]  That's the least that we can do for Americans.
[06:27:06.112 --> 06:27:08.554]  Well, it's interesting how they set the tone with this debate.
[06:27:08.974 --> 06:27:16.439]  Anderson Cooper came right out of there talking about the Trump tapes and how, you know, are you going to apologize for something you said back in 2005?
[06:27:16.479 --> 06:27:19.301]  You know, and he's like, well, I've apologized.
[06:27:19.362 --> 06:27:20.062]  I feel bad for it.
[06:27:20.082 --> 06:27:21.143]  But, you know, that's locker room talk.
[06:27:21.183 --> 06:27:26.447]  I mean, there's a lot of people out there that say a lot of things when they don't think they're being on tape or they're not being filmed.
[06:27:26.927 --> 06:27:29.169]  And they're just talking trash and saying things like that.
[06:27:29.209 --> 06:27:29.749]  But guess what?
[06:27:30.069 --> 06:27:32.331]  His locker room banter didn't rape anyone.
[06:27:32.831 --> 06:27:37.093]  Not only that, Biggs, but he was able to obliterate that within the first 10 minutes of that debate.
[06:27:37.113 --> 06:27:38.314]  It became a non-issue.
[06:27:38.374 --> 06:27:43.377]  He was able to effectively pivot and go on the attack, which is what we all wanted to see him do tonight.
[06:27:43.397 --> 06:27:49.740]  The interesting thing is, though, is when he brings that up and he goes, you know, I apologize, I'm sorry, you know, let's just go ahead and move forward with it.
[06:27:50.260 --> 06:27:52.061]  And Hillary Clinton's like, no, that's not good enough.
[06:27:52.162 --> 06:27:56.244]  And then the emails get brought up and she goes, well, I'm very sorry about that.
[06:27:56.264 --> 06:27:57.564]  I apologize about that.
[06:27:57.584 --> 06:27:59.766]  Let's just move on and move forward.
[06:28:00.566 --> 06:28:03.890]  And they did that throughout the night.
[06:28:04.050 --> 06:28:11.919]  You had Martha Riddick, you had Anderson Cooper continually debating Trump, shutting him down when he would try to... They were debating him.
[06:28:12.019 --> 06:28:12.360]  Exactly.
[06:28:12.580 --> 06:28:16.024]  Why was there a debate between the... You're supposed to be moderators.
[06:28:16.524 --> 06:28:17.685]  You are not the debaters.
[06:28:17.725 --> 06:28:19.325]  You are supposed to be moderators.
[06:28:19.365 --> 06:28:27.489]  Instead, they took it upon themselves to debate Donald Trump, to shut down his questioning on his re-examination, if you will, of Hillary Clinton.
[06:28:27.989 --> 06:28:30.430]  And they shut that down, and they were hostile to him.
[06:28:30.490 --> 06:28:31.590]  It was very interesting.
[06:28:31.630 --> 06:28:36.272]  And he came directly at them and said, hey, you're not being fair with me.
[06:28:36.332 --> 06:28:37.393]  It's a three against one.
[06:28:37.693 --> 06:28:39.334]  And that's precisely what he needed to do.
[06:28:39.394 --> 06:28:40.154]  We could all see it.
[06:28:40.554 --> 06:28:41.515]  And he came out.
[06:28:42.475 --> 06:28:44.476]  Tonight, he was like a boss, okay?
[06:28:44.496 --> 06:28:52.559]  He was the guy that we all expected him to be, and he really, after that awkwardness at the very beginning where he was kind of backpedaling a little bit, he got on the ground.
[06:28:52.599 --> 06:28:54.460]  I don't even know if that was his strategy for the night.
[06:28:54.520 --> 06:28:57.521]  I think he felt after that first question, like, alright, you guys are going to attack me.
[06:28:57.841 --> 06:29:02.104]  Because you could see him, they were doing close-ups on Hillary and she's kind of like grinning.
[06:29:02.324 --> 06:29:07.028]  But then the camera split screen and you see Trump pacing back and forth and you could see his brain working.
[06:29:07.068 --> 06:29:08.269]  He's like, you know what, screw it.
[06:29:08.509 --> 06:29:09.970]  I'm coming out, balls to the wall.
[06:29:10.190 --> 06:29:11.832]  We're gonna just go all the way.
[06:29:11.872 --> 06:29:13.733]  I'm gonna bring every single thing up.
[06:29:13.993 --> 06:29:16.015]  This was like Mortal Kombat, the video game.
[06:29:16.255 --> 06:29:20.080]  When you can go to the settings area, the sequence in there, and you can take the blood on or off.
[06:29:20.140 --> 06:29:21.201]  It was blood on tonight.
[06:29:21.241 --> 06:29:23.103]  I mean, it was a full battle.
[06:29:23.143 --> 06:29:24.264]  He held nothing back.
[06:29:24.525 --> 06:29:26.907]  He hit her on every single issue.
[06:29:27.208 --> 06:29:29.070]  And all she could do was sit there and stutter.
[06:29:29.090 --> 06:29:32.814]  I mean, she could really not even come back with one clear thought, one good answer.
[06:29:32.834 --> 06:29:33.415]  I mean, what do you think?
[06:29:33.695 --> 06:29:38.260]  I mean, all of us as reporters, we were watching it in the war room, if you will, taking notes, trying to mark.
[06:29:38.340 --> 06:29:43.165]  And you could hear this, oh no, amongst all of us the first couple of minutes, like, is he going to come back?
[06:29:43.225 --> 06:29:43.825]  Is he going to fight?
[06:29:43.886 --> 06:29:44.406]  Is he going to fight?
[06:29:44.446 --> 06:29:50.032]  And at one point it just turned, like you said, we were all just, you know, just ready to jump up and cheer.
[06:29:50.132 --> 06:29:50.933]  Something happened to him.
[06:29:50.953 --> 06:29:53.035]  There was a flip, you know, a switch that flipped.
[06:29:53.355 --> 06:29:55.157]  And once it did, she was done.
[06:29:55.197 --> 06:29:55.898]  She was obliterated.
[06:29:56.158 --> 06:30:03.903]  Yeah, you could tell that he was kind of pacing, going, ooh, they tried to coach me, they tried to tell me to stick to this script, and then he just went off and it turned on.
[06:30:04.343 --> 06:30:10.027]  That flame that he turned on on all of us, I think we all felt it reignite there in that moment.
[06:30:10.047 --> 06:30:11.908]  This was the original Trump that we got used to.
[06:30:11.948 --> 06:30:15.471]  This is the original Trump that a lot of people fell in love with, so to say, and saw that
[06:30:15.911 --> 06:30:17.532]  He was someone who didn't take any crap.
[06:30:17.572 --> 06:30:22.016]  He sat there, he fought for what he believed in, and he held nothing back.
[06:30:22.056 --> 06:30:22.876]  It was amazing.
[06:30:23.216 --> 06:30:26.419]  I mean, I was back there cheering, screaming, I was laughing.
[06:30:26.779 --> 06:30:29.821]  It was the greatest TV I've ever seen in my life.
[06:30:29.941 --> 06:30:31.342]  Better than football.
[06:30:31.563 --> 06:30:35.846]  My favorite moment, guys, she'd be in jail.
[06:30:35.886 --> 06:30:40.149]  When I'm president, I'm going to appoint a special prosecutor, and lady, you belong in jail.
[06:30:40.189 --> 06:30:41.930]  It doesn't get better than that.
[06:30:42.030 --> 06:30:43.091]  It doesn't get better than that.
[06:30:43.231 --> 06:30:48.395]  I love how she was like, well, thank goodness we don't have someone like Trump running the country because he's like, well, yeah, you'd be in jail.
[06:30:48.415 --> 06:30:50.997]  But I mean, look at the way Obama used the IRS.
[06:30:51.037 --> 06:30:55.421]  You know, James Comey is there helping her people he gave immunity to.
[06:30:55.461 --> 06:30:58.263]  Then he's helping them destroy the laptops, destroy the evidence.
[06:30:58.323 --> 06:30:58.603]  I mean.
[06:31:00.185 --> 06:31:00.805]  She's not even running.
[06:31:00.865 --> 06:31:01.826]  And that was a funny thing.
[06:31:02.146 --> 06:31:05.888]  He calls her out on every single lie about the email because she lied to everyone.
[06:31:05.908 --> 06:31:06.849]  She said, oh, I didn't do that.
[06:31:06.869 --> 06:31:08.110]  I didn't have classified information.
[06:31:08.150 --> 06:31:08.810]  I didn't do this and that.
[06:31:09.130 --> 06:31:10.511]  And then it came out that she did have that.
[06:31:10.731 --> 06:31:12.652]  And Trump clearly stated all those facts.
[06:31:12.692 --> 06:31:16.575]  And the next comment, which she goes, well, those are all total lies.
[06:31:16.915 --> 06:31:18.016]  I never did any of that.
[06:31:18.296 --> 06:31:20.998]  And the entire crowd in that place kind of like cheered.
[06:31:21.418 --> 06:31:23.579]  And I mean, they booed her when she said that.
[06:31:23.859 --> 06:31:25.560]  And Anderson Cooper's like, no, no, no, no, no, you can't.
[06:31:26.081 --> 06:31:26.461]  No, no, no.
[06:31:26.581 --> 06:31:32.256]  Seriously, he couldn't even get the words out because he was like, you guys just, you're taking up time.
[06:31:33.877 --> 06:31:36.778]  And don't forget the fight began before the debate.
[06:31:37.119 --> 06:31:42.701]  Because he had that press conference with Juanita Broderick, Paula Jones, and Kathleen Wiley, or Willie.
[06:31:43.042 --> 06:31:44.562]  And they're all hanging out together now.
[06:31:44.722 --> 06:31:45.903]  So these are new friends.
[06:31:45.943 --> 06:31:47.844]  They have formed a bond, these women.
[06:31:48.144 --> 06:31:49.585]  And they're going after him big time.
[06:31:49.925 --> 06:31:51.185]  You can read their tweets tonight.
[06:31:51.205 --> 06:31:52.466]  They're going after him big time.
[06:31:52.486 --> 06:31:53.146]  That's good news.
[06:31:53.467 --> 06:31:55.828]  Will somebody give out the telephone number to call in?
[06:31:55.848 --> 06:31:56.728]  Because I don't have it here.
[06:31:56.768 --> 06:31:58.769]  So we want to get some callers.
[06:31:58.809 --> 06:32:02.231]  I know they're probably chomping at the bit to respond about what they thought about the debate.
[06:32:06.167 --> 06:32:07.409]  I do not have that number.
[06:32:07.429 --> 06:32:09.271]  The phone number to call into right now is 877-79-Alex.
[06:32:09.291 --> 06:32:09.952]  Once again, 877-789-Alex.
[06:32:09.972 --> 06:32:10.333]  There we go.
[06:32:20.680 --> 06:32:27.026]  Well, the New York Times is saying that in a comparatively subdued performance, Mrs. Clinton hewed close to the basic arguments of her campaign.
[06:32:27.046 --> 06:32:28.827]  In other words, she couldn't go off script.
[06:32:28.907 --> 06:32:30.749]  She was totally dominated by Donald Trump.
[06:32:31.089 --> 06:32:39.057]  It's not a good night for Hillary Clinton, and the press is doing everything they can to pull this out, even saying, look, he was looming behind her, intimidating her.
[06:32:39.097 --> 06:32:45.863]  I mean, it's really pathetic using four-letter languages, you know, words as their only response to Donald Trump.
[06:32:46.863 --> 06:32:48.204]  I think they clearly lost.
[06:32:48.284 --> 06:32:50.345]  They're doing everything they can to try to cover this.
[06:32:50.485 --> 06:32:55.487]  What did you think about when she said, you know, we need to get dark money out of politics?
[06:32:55.507 --> 06:32:56.928]  Was she speaking of herself?
[06:32:57.128 --> 06:32:59.509]  I'm like, finally, some self-awareness there.
[06:32:59.549 --> 06:33:03.270]  We need to get the dark money that people aren't accountable for out of politics.
[06:33:03.310 --> 06:33:03.991]  I'm like, yes!
[06:33:04.351 --> 06:33:06.092]  Wait a second, she means everybody else.
[06:33:06.112 --> 06:33:13.475]  What about all the dark money that you stole from the people of Haiti that should have gotten that from your foundation that was supposed to be used to help them but they didn't get it?
[06:33:13.835 --> 06:33:21.463]  Is George Soros gonna give back all of his dark money or any of these, you know, Saudi Arabian... Trump called out Soros tonight, which was shocking!
[06:33:21.503 --> 06:33:24.065]  I'm like, did he just call out George Soros?
[06:33:24.165 --> 06:33:25.887]  That was freaking awesome!
[06:33:25.927 --> 06:33:32.674]  That was another time when Clinton's eyes went... Well, another one of the great things too, though, was Trump called out...
[06:33:33.658 --> 06:33:37.640]  Bill Clinton's meeting with the Attorney General before that whole email thing with the FBI.
[06:33:37.780 --> 06:33:43.242]  And I was like, yes, you know, you're bringing this up on a huge platform right now, on this debate right now.
[06:33:43.262 --> 06:33:45.963]  People are going to be Googling that, trying to find out what's going on.
[06:33:45.983 --> 06:33:47.283]  A lot of people don't know that that happened.
[06:33:47.303 --> 06:33:48.484]  But, you know, here we are.
[06:33:48.504 --> 06:33:50.925]  We have proof that Hillary Clinton deleted those emails.
[06:33:51.025 --> 06:33:52.846]  She sent classified material.
[06:33:53.066 --> 06:33:55.927]  She destroyed cell phones, laptops.
[06:33:56.987 --> 06:34:00.409]  And FBI Director Comey comes out and goes, no one's going to prosecute you.
[06:34:00.449 --> 06:34:05.772]  Not only that, nobody's going to prosecute Cheryl Mills or criminal immunity all the way around.
[06:34:05.812 --> 06:34:09.194]  The two techies that set up the server also not criminally prosecuted.
[06:34:09.214 --> 06:34:11.816]  So you and your handlers, you know, you guys get a free...
[06:34:12.416 --> 06:34:12.636]  Ass!
[06:34:13.176 --> 06:34:14.036]  Right.
[06:34:14.137 --> 06:34:20.658]  And then she has the audacity to say, thank goodness we don't have someone like Trump running the country because he just run it into the ground.
[06:34:20.738 --> 06:34:35.802]  And we're looking at all of these career politicians who are so corrupt and that when they get an office like Obama, they use the IRS to go after their political opponents when Donald Trump is going to be the you're fired candidate and he's going to get those people out of there.
[06:34:35.822 --> 06:34:36.842]  I mean, at least that's what he says.
[06:34:37.222 --> 06:34:42.745]  You know, he's very good in business, so I could see it happening that he'd get in there and say, look, we don't need you.
[06:34:42.825 --> 06:34:48.628]  Not only are we going to cut taxes, because it makes sense, but we also do not need all of this government regulation.
[06:34:48.648 --> 06:34:53.991]  You know, we're having editorials from Politico and other places saying Donald Trump can't cut the bureaucracy.
[06:34:54.611 --> 06:34:56.132]  And that's an absolute total lie.
[06:34:56.912 --> 06:35:02.033]  These are the same people who said Ronald Reagan couldn't fire the illegally striking air traffic controllers.
[06:35:02.734 --> 06:35:09.156]  We have to understand that the bureaucracy has taken over, that Congress has abdicated their authority to write law.
[06:35:09.716 --> 06:35:21.427]  Given it over to these regulatory agencies who then write these laws, say that because they're civil and not criminal, that you don't have the presumption of innocence, that the prohibitions against excessive fines do not apply.
[06:35:21.967 --> 06:35:24.749]  And we have to understand that these agencies that have been created
[06:35:25.430 --> 06:35:28.953]  Have not been authorized by Congress, reauthorized by Congress.
[06:35:28.993 --> 06:35:31.895]  They have to be reauthorized on a regular basis.
[06:35:31.915 --> 06:35:34.557]  Some of these have not been reauthorized for 10 years.
[06:35:34.898 --> 06:35:47.408]  There's a lot that a president could do to shut down this criminal system that has been set up in violation of the Constitution, mainly through Congress abdicating its authority to these people, both Democrats and Republicans.
[06:35:47.697 --> 06:35:48.217]  Right, David.
[06:35:48.257 --> 06:35:53.081]  Well, we've already seen how Hillary Clinton is going to regulate Wall Street.
[06:35:53.541 --> 06:35:59.925]  Don't forget, she was talking about how, well, I went in there and wagged my finger and told them they better, you know, get straight.
[06:36:00.045 --> 06:36:08.331]  And then we see these leaked emails with some of her speeches in them, where she's talking about, I think Wall Street is the best to regulate themselves.
[06:36:08.671 --> 06:36:12.653]  If anyone knows how to regulate the industry, it's the people in the industry.
[06:36:12.954 --> 06:36:14.815]  So we don't even know who we're getting.
[06:36:14.855 --> 06:36:15.996]  Are we getting public Hillary?
[06:36:16.636 --> 06:36:18.257]  That's called regulatory capture.
[06:36:36.847 --> 06:36:41.529]  We know how that's worked out with the FDA, we know how that's worked out with many government agencies.
[06:36:41.969 --> 06:37:02.515]  They have a cozy relationship with the companies that they're supposed to be regulating and they do precisely what the big guys want so they can shut the small guys down and that's exactly what Hillary Clinton was very cleverly doing with Wall Street and assuming a supine position for them if you will saying I will do whatever you wish
[06:37:03.015 --> 06:37:05.117]  I will let you guys tell me whatever you want to do.
[06:37:05.538 --> 06:37:21.413]  That was precisely what she was doing and it was really a pay-for-play moment if you understand what's going on and if you see what's been done with the regulatory capture where the big companies tell the so-called regulating agencies what they're going to do and what they're not going to do.
[06:37:21.803 --> 06:37:37.277]  Well, that's why whenever she would respond to any of these questions, when she'd go on this long, contrived, totally canned answer, it's like, I do not believe anything that you're saying because right here, with these leaked speeches, you are clearly laying it out there.
[06:37:37.637 --> 06:37:47.309]  That you are going to say one thing to the public and do a totally opposite of what you're saying in private, which is why she was all for the TPP, helping to draft it, in fact.
[06:37:47.689 --> 06:37:49.011]  It called it the gold standard.
[06:37:49.271 --> 06:37:57.181]  But then once she was officially going to throw her hat in to run for president, she was all of a sudden against it once it came out, once it was finalized.
[06:37:57.301 --> 06:37:59.403]  Well, Trump was definitely the king troll.
[06:37:59.523 --> 06:38:00.484]  I mean, what was it last week?
[06:38:00.544 --> 06:38:05.269]  He bought ClintonCain.com and set it up to make it a pro-Trump website.
[06:38:05.369 --> 06:38:08.873]  And then, think about the environment inside that debate room today.
[06:38:09.273 --> 06:38:12.817]  You've got three women who have accused Bill Clinton of rape.
[06:38:14.258 --> 06:38:18.603]  How uncomfortable did that have to be for Hillary, for Bill to be there, for Chelsea?
[06:38:18.763 --> 06:38:25.288]  I don't think Hillary has a soul, but when they cut to Bill's face, you could clearly see, all the color had drained out of him.
[06:38:25.308 --> 06:38:29.351]  Well, he looks white as a ghost anyway, but he had these purple veins that were visible.
[06:38:29.391 --> 06:38:31.212]  He looked very, we actually have a still of this.
[06:38:31.252 --> 06:38:37.537]  We're going to put it into something that we're shooting, that we're doing, but the still of his face, it's unbelievable.
[06:38:37.597 --> 06:38:39.138]  You could tell he felt that.
[06:38:39.838 --> 06:38:42.760]  Well, I was glad to see Trump too come out and really call out Hillary Clinton.
[06:38:42.880 --> 06:38:44.662]  You know, hey, where are you going to be at at 3 a.m.?
[06:38:44.702 --> 06:38:45.762]  Are you going to answer that call?
[06:38:45.822 --> 06:38:52.507]  You know, we saw your video that you came out with back in 2008, I believe it was, and actually did like a parody video of that myself.
[06:38:52.927 --> 06:38:55.629]  But he's like, who's going to be there if she becomes president?
[06:38:55.649 --> 06:38:56.610]  Is she going to answer that call?
[06:38:56.990 --> 06:39:01.093]  Because Ambassador Stevens sent numerous requests.
[06:39:01.353 --> 06:39:04.495]  If it's a donor giving her money, she'll answer that phone call.
[06:39:04.535 --> 06:39:05.696]  She'll be there in two seconds.
[06:39:05.936 --> 06:39:10.541]  He also tried to get her to say radical Muslim terrorist and once again she wouldn't do it.
[06:39:10.601 --> 06:39:10.962]  Nope.
[06:39:11.342 --> 06:39:11.943]  Nope.
[06:39:12.003 --> 06:39:13.705]  You can't bite the hand that feeds you, Darren.
[06:39:13.725 --> 06:39:19.512]  She literally had so much crap coming out of her mouth, that's why this fly just kept going and laying on her.
[06:39:19.552 --> 06:39:20.593]  That's going to be the big news.
[06:39:20.613 --> 06:39:23.116]  That's going to be the big news of the night is the fly.
[06:39:23.156 --> 06:39:24.618]  Hillary is the lord of the fly.
[06:39:26.468 --> 06:39:31.854]  One of the things that Hillary said was she was not going to let dangerous people into the country.
[06:39:32.494 --> 06:39:48.370]  But a year ago, on October 28, 2013, we know from these emails that have been leaked, she said they can't possibly vet all those refugees so they don't know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with the legitimate refugees.
[06:39:48.670 --> 06:39:49.551]  That was Hillary Clinton.
[06:39:49.771 --> 06:39:56.578]  Now, anyone who says that today, Hillary Clinton labels a xenophobe, a racist, somebody who is Islamophobic.
[06:39:58.359 --> 06:39:59.539]  Yeah, well, that's the thing.
[06:39:59.579 --> 06:40:01.300]  It's like, which Hillary are we getting?
[06:40:01.320 --> 06:40:03.140]  Public Hillary or Private Hillary?
[06:40:03.180 --> 06:40:08.581]  And I hope that that really sticks with people, that she can't blame it on the Russians now because she confirmed it.
[06:40:09.121 --> 06:40:15.103]  She didn't say that's... I mean, she could have easily just said, well, you know, I can't believe WikiLeaks because they're Russians.
[06:40:15.523 --> 06:40:16.163]  She didn't, though.
[06:40:16.323 --> 06:40:19.563]  She responded to it and then made up some stupid story.
[06:40:19.844 --> 06:40:23.764]  And you could tell right then on the spot she was stuttering and sputtering.
[06:40:23.824 --> 06:40:25.165]  She couldn't even get her answer straight.
[06:40:25.225 --> 06:40:26.645]  She was totally rattled.
[06:40:27.345 --> 06:40:28.926]  No earpiece, Leigh-Anne.
[06:40:29.246 --> 06:40:31.146]  The truth is really easy to remember.
[06:40:31.646 --> 06:40:33.567]  Lies are impossibly hard.
[06:40:33.627 --> 06:40:34.908]  You've got to have the earpiece.
[06:40:35.708 --> 06:40:36.848]  I mean, that's got to be the problem.
[06:40:36.928 --> 06:40:37.989]  And that's just it.
[06:40:38.109 --> 06:40:48.632]  She was scrambling for the story, whereas the Trump that we all have come to appreciate is teleprompter-free, you know, just like we do here at InfoWars.
[06:40:48.672 --> 06:40:54.814]  And that's why he was able to just hit her with those stinging hits with the truth, because you don't need a teleprompter for that.
[06:40:54.994 --> 06:40:58.997]  Let's talk about her inability to say radical Islamic terrorist, okay?
[06:40:59.178 --> 06:41:03.621]  She didn't have a problem in that speech, the one that I just quoted from three years ago, October 28th.
[06:41:04.082 --> 06:41:08.986]  She was talking to the Jewish United Fund, a metropolitan Chicago, okay?
[06:41:09.486 --> 06:41:15.612]  Now, she said that about, well, we don't know who the jihadis are, we can't really vet them, we can't tell the jihadis from the refugees.
[06:41:16.092 --> 06:41:21.397]  She also said, the Saudis opposed the Muslim Brotherhood, she said, which is kind of ironic
[06:41:21.917 --> 06:41:31.292]  Since the Saudis have exported more extreme ideology, exported more extreme ideology than any other place on earth over the course of the last 30 years.
[06:41:31.893 --> 06:41:32.694]  Now she knows that.
[06:41:33.275 --> 06:41:36.640]  She knows that it's the Wahhabists that are exporting this.
[06:41:37.501 --> 06:41:40.003]  Most radical form of radical Islam.
[06:41:40.363 --> 06:41:47.729]  And yet these are the people who brag about the fact they gave 25 million dollars to Hillary Clinton, channeling it through her Clinton Foundation and other issues.
[06:41:48.130 --> 06:41:50.272]  They are key contributors to Hillary Clinton.
[06:41:50.572 --> 06:41:55.176]  The people that she herself says are the most extreme ideology.
[06:41:55.876 --> 06:41:57.677]  In the last 30 years.
[06:41:58.357 --> 06:41:59.258]  Anywhere on Earth.
[06:41:59.538 --> 06:42:05.901]  And we have to understand that the Saudis have executed, beheaded more people than ISIS have.
[06:42:06.061 --> 06:42:09.783]  Where are the videos of the Saudis beheading people?
[06:42:09.823 --> 06:42:12.705]  They do far more than ISIS does even with their videos.
[06:42:13.105 --> 06:42:15.066]  And that's the people that support Hillary Clinton.
[06:42:17.307 --> 06:42:18.708]  Yeah, we're gonna go to some phone calls.
[06:42:18.728 --> 06:42:19.909]  The crew's doing an incredible job.
[06:42:19.929 --> 06:42:21.330]  I want you guys to stay here as late as you want.
[06:42:21.690 --> 06:42:27.375]  We have over a million people on YouTube and Facebook, and the info we're streaming says like a half million, so total it's about a million.
[06:42:27.395 --> 06:42:28.976]  A million people are watching right now.
[06:42:29.016 --> 06:42:29.817]  They want to call in.
[06:42:29.837 --> 06:42:31.018]  You guys are doing a great job.
[06:42:31.038 --> 06:42:31.698]  I just want to say this.
[06:42:32.078 --> 06:42:34.060]  Thank God Trump counterstruck tonight.
[06:42:34.400 --> 06:42:35.261]  I knew he was real.
[06:42:35.581 --> 06:42:36.442]  This is so great.
[06:42:36.462 --> 06:42:37.242]  This is historic.
[06:42:37.543 --> 06:42:38.803]  I'm so proud of this crew.
[06:42:39.484 --> 06:42:43.067]  Everybody here behind the scenes is as important as us on air, or more important.
[06:42:43.467 --> 06:42:46.369]  Jeremy, you jump in here before we go to calls, but I am going to leave here.
[06:42:46.389 --> 06:42:47.270]  I'm going to be with my kids right now.
[06:42:47.290 --> 06:42:48.011]  I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[06:42:48.031 --> 06:42:48.191]  to 3 p.m.
[06:42:48.211 --> 06:42:53.075]  I'm going to be listening to you on a little radio when I drive home, on the app when I get home.
[06:42:54.414 --> 06:43:03.901]  You know, everybody from Margaret to Joe to Leigh Ann to, you know, Biggs and Darren and Daria and, you know, everybody that's here.
[06:43:03.941 --> 06:43:06.122]  This whole crew is so amazing.
[06:43:06.162 --> 06:43:07.263]  You listeners are amazing.
[06:43:07.563 --> 06:43:10.125]  This is so historic and it's just good to see.
[06:43:10.165 --> 06:43:11.846]  And even if Trump wins, they still have the election.
[06:43:12.307 --> 06:43:13.147]  We're not going to be violent.
[06:43:13.227 --> 06:43:14.508]  We're winning the info war.
[06:43:14.848 --> 06:43:15.889]  The truth is coming out.
[06:43:16.189 --> 06:43:17.910]  We want prosperity and freedom for everybody.
[06:43:17.950 --> 06:43:18.931]  We're all humans together.
[06:43:19.331 --> 06:43:20.312]  It's so damn exciting.
[06:43:24.764 --> 06:43:25.284]  Victory!
[06:43:25.304 --> 06:43:38.571]  Hey, this is more proof that that what does not kill Trump only makes him stronger, because they went after him big time with, you know, they timed this whole WikiLeaks thing with this locker room talk of Donald Trump.
[06:43:38.951 --> 06:43:40.332]  It was timed perfectly.
[06:43:40.432 --> 06:43:45.234]  They waited for that moment, and that's when they released the audio clips.
[06:43:46.175 --> 06:43:46.755]  Didn't phase him.
[06:43:46.875 --> 06:43:48.176]  It looks like it did not phase him.
[06:43:48.216 --> 06:43:51.057]  He went into full attack mode, and I think he won the debate.
[06:43:51.516 --> 06:43:57.819]  Yeah, I think initially, and Biggs kind of made this point, initially he kind of did just want to say, look, I apologize.
[06:43:57.859 --> 06:44:02.041]  I apologize to my family and to America and I'd like to just move on.
[06:44:02.061 --> 06:44:03.262]  And they were like, no.
[06:44:03.362 --> 06:44:04.282]  And they kept pushing.
[06:44:04.322 --> 06:44:06.623]  And then both moderators asked about it.
[06:44:06.683 --> 06:44:10.525]  And then they got the question, the random question from the audience member.
[06:44:10.545 --> 06:44:12.506]  And it was like still on the same topic.
[06:44:12.546 --> 06:44:13.487]  So he's like, you know what?
[06:44:14.387 --> 06:44:15.408]  The gloves are off.
[06:44:15.508 --> 06:44:20.491]  And we knew that Anderson Cooper was not going to ask Hillary the same type of questions.
[06:44:20.571 --> 06:44:23.333]  Why is she an enabler?
[06:44:23.933 --> 06:44:30.417]  And why does she destroy the women's lives that are accusing Bill Clinton of rape?
[06:44:30.537 --> 06:44:31.898]  And she destroyed their lives.
[06:44:32.058 --> 06:44:34.340]  That's just a common known fact.
[06:44:34.740 --> 06:44:36.441]  But those questions were not asked to Hillary.
[06:44:36.874 --> 06:44:37.995]  Darren, I never got that.
[06:44:38.035 --> 06:44:42.979]  You know, when InfoWars would go out in the street, we would ask Hillary supporters, why do you support her?
[06:44:43.019 --> 06:44:44.260]  You know, what's the deal?
[06:44:44.440 --> 06:44:46.642]  And everybody would be like, well, she's really pro-woman.
[06:44:47.202 --> 06:44:51.986]  We're talking about a woman that is covered for somebody that is a serial... A lifetime.
[06:44:52.967 --> 06:44:54.629]  A serial rapist!
[06:44:54.769 --> 06:44:59.494]  It's just unbelievable that anybody would think that she's pro-woman.
[06:44:59.534 --> 06:45:00.515]  It astounds me.
[06:45:00.535 --> 06:45:01.596]  It just astounds me.
[06:45:01.616 --> 06:45:02.177]  Yep.
[06:45:02.617 --> 06:45:05.200]  Alright, well let me give out the number really quick for the phone calls.
[06:45:05.280 --> 06:45:07.202]  It's 877-789-2539.
[06:45:07.682 --> 06:45:10.525]  I guess we'll go ahead and start taking some calls.
[06:45:11.366 --> 06:45:14.229]  Looks like the first call we have up there is Shelby in Texas.
[06:45:14.289 --> 06:45:15.911]  Shelby, what question do you have for us?
[06:45:17.682 --> 06:45:19.263]  Actually, I would like to make a comment.
[06:45:19.403 --> 06:45:25.407]  I like the fact that he managed to call out Hillary and the moderators for the three-on-one attack.
[06:45:25.447 --> 06:45:26.668]  That was just amazing.
[06:45:26.768 --> 06:45:30.270]  And I've been watching you guys for some time as well.
[06:45:30.811 --> 06:45:33.072]  And I would say, keep it up if it works.
[06:45:33.713 --> 06:45:34.873]  Thank you, Shelby.
[06:45:36.755 --> 06:45:39.376]  Alright, well it looks like we got another caller.
[06:45:39.577 --> 06:45:41.698]  Denil, I believe, from Oregon.
[06:45:41.718 --> 06:45:42.699]  Let's go ahead and take that.
[06:45:43.956 --> 06:45:44.476]  Hey, how's it going?
[06:46:15.144 --> 06:46:30.648]  Trump literally uncrushed Hillary, and people that never ever heard Trump ever speak about these things, ever, they finally for the first time heard about what he had to say, and their eyes probably opened.
[06:46:30.668 --> 06:46:39.311]  And I believe in that, that Trump had opened other people's eyes, because other people never heard of him, only through the debates.
[06:46:40.322 --> 06:46:44.665]  Well, I do think this will probably be one of the most memorized second presidential debates ever.
[06:46:44.685 --> 06:46:47.267]  I mean, it was, uh, it was out there.
[06:46:47.287 --> 06:46:49.789]  I mean, it was amazing to see him come out there like he did.
[06:46:50.089 --> 06:46:50.930]  He was composure.
[06:46:50.990 --> 06:46:54.353]  Get to the facts and really just take the gloves off.
[06:46:54.433 --> 06:46:55.554]  He took the gloves off tonight.
[06:46:55.594 --> 06:46:57.075]  It was unreal to see it.
[06:46:57.435 --> 06:46:59.297]  You're right about the historical aspect of this.
[06:46:59.577 --> 06:47:02.919]  And I honestly think that he has this fix.
[06:47:03.039 --> 06:47:03.280]  I do.
[06:47:03.360 --> 06:47:05.862]  I wasn't, I wasn't convinced of that going into this because
[06:47:06.462 --> 06:47:06.722]  I don't know.
[06:47:22.672 --> 06:47:24.213]  Oh, come on, he's lying about that.
[06:47:24.273 --> 06:47:25.653]  And then what are they going to do?
[06:47:25.873 --> 06:47:27.994]  Most of them are just going to ignore the facts anyway.
[06:47:28.314 --> 06:47:33.915]  But a lot of them, they're going to have to wake up to the realization that Hillary Clinton is indeed Crooked Hillary.
[06:47:34.275 --> 06:47:38.857]  And then she has enabled a rapist husband for most of his adult life.
[06:47:39.317 --> 06:47:41.177]  These facts are all coming out.
[06:47:41.438 --> 06:47:42.698]  And I couldn't be happier.
[06:47:43.513 --> 06:47:58.327]  Right and we know she did speak several times about well everything he just said was completely false and so obviously we're gonna have to go ahead and fact-check that and say well actually it's not false at all but we know they're not gonna fact-check Hillary
[06:47:58.928 --> 06:48:04.870]  Because of this email leak, we see that there's a very cozy press relationship with the Clintons.
[06:48:05.130 --> 06:48:14.133]  She had all of these really top-level people in the media meeting for these off-the-record cocktail parties where they could basically
[06:48:14.953 --> 06:48:17.434]  Let the media know what they're allowed to talk about.
[06:48:17.614 --> 06:48:32.761]  And one of the specific things on the agenda there that they talk about is how to cover, giving them some other topics to cover when bad stories come out about the Clinton Foundation, or the email scandal, or any myriad of Clinton scandals.
[06:48:33.421 --> 06:48:43.406]  They're feeding the press, their favored press, on a surrogate's list, if you will, and basically telling them what they should talk about instead.
[06:48:43.846 --> 06:48:47.470]  Well, and the press does their fact-checking at HillaryClinton.com.
[06:48:47.570 --> 06:48:48.070]  Exactly.
[06:48:49.472 --> 06:48:51.694]  Don't go there.
[06:48:51.714 --> 06:48:52.835]  Don't go to Snopes either.
[06:48:52.855 --> 06:48:53.476]  Go to Snopes!
[06:48:54.297 --> 06:48:58.541]  I think some of the biggest losers this weekend are these GOP sellouts.
[06:48:59.121 --> 06:49:05.648]  Absolutely no problem with Bill and Hillary Clinton's violence against women for decades.
[06:49:05.948 --> 06:49:11.455]  Never spoke out about that, and yet come out and say Donald Trump needs to resign, drop off the ticket.
[06:49:11.976 --> 06:49:14.499]  Nobody in the past has ever called for that.
[06:49:14.879 --> 06:49:18.404]  And nobody's going to do that, quite frankly, and now he's hit it out of the park.
[06:49:18.564 --> 06:49:20.907]  You know, and that goes for Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[06:49:20.987 --> 06:49:22.168]  Especially Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[06:49:22.209 --> 06:49:23.150]  And Robert De Niro.
[06:49:23.410 --> 06:49:23.690]  Yes.
[06:49:23.871 --> 06:49:24.492]  And John McCain.
[06:49:24.512 --> 06:49:25.633]  And Miley Cyrus.
[06:49:25.673 --> 06:49:30.199]  And all these celebrities that are just so shocked and offended by Donald Trump's locker room touch.
[06:49:30.680 --> 06:49:37.910]  Arnold Schwarzenegger's marriage blew up in his face because he had an illegitimate son with his maid.
[06:49:37.930 --> 06:49:38.391]  11 maids!
[06:49:38.471 --> 06:49:40.454]  And this guy's gonna come out and say, what's that?
[06:49:40.854 --> 06:49:42.616]  It was his live-in maid.
[06:49:42.656 --> 06:49:44.278]  His live-in maid.
[06:49:44.358 --> 06:49:49.123]  And she's like bringing the son around for 18 years.
[06:49:49.183 --> 06:49:49.643]  I think he was 17, 18.
[06:49:49.703 --> 06:49:52.126]  Maybe Arnold didn't know what live-in means.
[06:49:52.687 --> 06:49:54.408]  I mean, my gosh, what a slap.
[06:49:54.448 --> 06:49:55.469]  But now he says, because...
[06:49:57.992 --> 06:50:04.376]  Because you had Trump say that he hit up on a woman and she turned him down and so he struck out.
[06:50:04.776 --> 06:50:18.084]  Because he said that, then Arnold Schwarzenegger, who's part of this Hollywood crowd that flaunts this kind of permissive sexuality in our society, now Arnold Schwarzenegger, who's the very embodiment of that, says, I can't vote for him.
[06:50:18.804 --> 06:50:20.285]  Yeah, phony, phony, phony.
[06:50:20.305 --> 06:50:22.785]  Do you guys remember what McCain said about his wife in 2008?
[06:50:22.965 --> 06:50:30.387]  He had the nerve to criticize Trump for, you know, this, this, this lewd conversation that he had about women.
[06:50:30.427 --> 06:50:36.389]  But John McCain called his wife the C-word in front of reporters in 2008, and a trollop.
[06:50:36.869 --> 06:50:37.950]  This is all online.
[06:50:38.430 --> 06:50:42.171]  And he has the nerve to, I'm wondering if he remembers that at all, because it was on the record.
[06:50:45.333 --> 06:50:49.676]  Well, and that's the POW that Hillary Clinton keeps talking about.
[06:50:49.897 --> 06:50:54.220]  She keeps saying that Donald Trump has said really crude things about POWs.
[06:50:54.240 --> 06:50:56.242]  Her little neocon warmonger.
[06:50:56.642 --> 06:50:57.242]  John McCain.
[06:50:57.663 --> 06:50:58.683]  Songbird McCain.
[06:50:58.904 --> 06:51:03.567]  And they keep parading these guys out every time they think they've got something on Donald Trump.
[06:51:04.108 --> 06:51:07.350]  They keep parading these people out and saying, well, I'm unendorsing him now.
[06:51:07.370 --> 06:51:10.393]  It's like John McCain never backed Donald Trump.
[06:51:11.033 --> 06:51:13.314]  Arnold Schwarzenegger never backed Donald Trump.
[06:51:13.394 --> 06:51:15.255]  The Bushes never backed Donald Trump.
[06:51:15.816 --> 06:51:21.999]  It's so incredibly phony and they do it every time they think that they've got a zinger because they planted something on him.
[06:51:22.039 --> 06:51:23.200]  This whole thing was a plant.
[06:51:23.780 --> 06:51:32.765]  Done to distract attention away from the substantive issues that even we haven't really covered to that extent here at InfoWars.
[06:51:32.805 --> 06:51:37.308]  I mean everybody is talking about the locker room talk and nobody is talking about
[06:51:37.768 --> 06:51:39.690]  Hillary's exposure of her lies.
[06:51:39.710 --> 06:51:45.174]  I mean, the common market, the open trade, the open borders, that's her dream, is to make a North American Union.
[06:51:45.214 --> 06:51:48.476]  We were told for years that that was a conspiracy theory.
[06:51:48.696 --> 06:51:49.857]  Yeah, by Hillary Clinton.
[06:51:50.077 --> 06:51:54.381]  It's not a conspiracy theory, it's a conspiracy plan by Clinton and the globalists, and that's her dream.
[06:51:55.101 --> 06:51:57.983]  Well, let's go ahead and go to the next caller, Mark in Oregon.
[06:51:58.003 --> 06:51:59.745]  He wants to talk about poll manipulation.
[06:52:00.885 --> 06:52:02.026]  Hey there, Mark.
[06:52:02.086 --> 06:52:02.787]  Hi, good evening, folks.
[06:52:03.908 --> 06:52:04.368]  How are you?
[06:52:05.229 --> 06:52:05.409]  Good.
[06:52:06.341 --> 06:52:09.082]  And thank you for all of your stellar work there.
[06:52:09.322 --> 06:52:13.084]  I follow it from ear to ear and very opinionated about it.
[06:52:16.226 --> 06:52:24.409]  Donald Trump, on average, he has at least 60 times the rally attendance than that of Hillary Clinton.
[06:52:24.429 --> 06:52:30.472]  I think we can take just a, you know, a rough, but I think very accurate
[06:52:31.664 --> 06:52:45.294]  Uh, amount-wise, demographic impression from this, and that would be that, of course, not everyone's going to come to any given rally of either candidate, but they will have their base core followers that do show up.
[06:52:46.335 --> 06:52:52.319]  And Hillary can have as little as 150, and they're photoshopping the event just to make it look like there are more people there.
[06:52:52.379 --> 06:52:59.444]  They, as Alex has so well reported, they bring the walls in to make it look like it's a larger room than it is.
[06:53:01.073 --> 06:53:11.596]  So, nevertheless, the false polls would have us believe that the campaigns are pretty much neck and neck.
[06:53:12.696 --> 06:53:19.797]  And, of course, this is all the dark side needs to steal the election for Clinton.
[06:53:21.398 --> 06:53:30.500]  And this looks like a very successful steal of this election is now certain, because I don't see anything to stop
[06:53:33.619 --> 06:53:49.503]  Well, Hillary kind of came out during the debate and started talking about how, you know, Russia was probably behind all these leaked emails and all this leaked stuff.
[06:53:49.523 --> 06:53:57.905]  And then she almost kind of hinted at the fact that if she loses, that it'd probably be because the Russians came in, hacked it, and swayed the whole
[06:53:58.385 --> 06:53:59.425]  The whole thing somehow.
[06:53:59.445 --> 06:54:05.588]  So that way if she loses, but she will because like you said, I've been to tons of these Trump events and I've been to quite a few Hillary Clinton events.
[06:54:06.388 --> 06:54:08.449]  He's trumping them, you know, by the thousands.
[06:54:08.489 --> 06:54:12.891]  I mean, he has to turn away 10, 15, 20,000 people, but they don't leave.
[06:54:12.911 --> 06:54:19.194]  They stay outside in the parking lot, have conversations, engage in debates with the anti-Trump protesters.
[06:54:19.574 --> 06:54:21.355]  Because people just want to be around that environment.
[06:54:21.395 --> 06:54:24.556]  They want to be around the personality that is Donald Trump.
[06:54:24.576 --> 06:54:28.877]  They want to be around who they believe is going to be the next president of the United States.
[06:54:29.117 --> 06:54:30.278]  And everyone can see that.
[06:54:30.318 --> 06:54:34.619]  No one goes to watch her unless they want to go hear her lie to them in person.
[06:54:34.899 --> 06:54:41.761]  But she kind of hinted, I don't know if you guys caught that, that, you know, oh, you know, if there's something goes on, you know, Russia's probably already behind these leaks.
[06:54:41.801 --> 06:54:46.123]  So, you know, what makes you think that it wouldn't be them if, you know, I get cheated out of this?
[06:54:46.443 --> 06:54:52.168]  Right, it would be Russia's fault because Russia hacked her even though she has no proof of this whatsoever.
[06:54:52.548 --> 06:54:56.651]  I wish that somebody would call her out on this just once and be like, where's the stream?
[06:54:56.671 --> 06:54:58.553]  Where's the paper trail for this?
[06:54:58.633 --> 06:54:59.453]  She keeps saying it.
[06:54:59.894 --> 06:55:08.200]  Every time she says it, it really makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up because she really wants to indict them for a military conflict with them.
[06:55:08.240 --> 06:55:08.801]  It's amazing.
[06:55:09.264 --> 06:55:12.865]  Margaret, think about what happened today in Washington.
[06:55:13.226 --> 06:55:15.626]  You had a thousand people show up at the Trump Hotel.
[06:55:15.686 --> 06:55:16.667]  I think it was in Washington.
[06:55:16.687 --> 06:55:17.547]  It was one of the cities.
[06:55:17.567 --> 06:55:22.229]  You had a thousand people show up to cheer him on because of what had happened this last week.
[06:55:22.849 --> 06:55:27.791]  And the kind of crowds we've seen, as a caller pointed out, the kind of crowds we've seen are totally unprecedented.
[06:55:28.131 --> 06:55:30.312]  I've been covering politics for decades.
[06:55:30.692 --> 06:55:31.973]  I've never seen anybody do this.
[06:55:32.033 --> 06:55:36.537]  As a matter of fact, the closest we've seen with this was Barack Obama when he ran eight years ago.
[06:55:36.918 --> 06:55:43.844]  But you have to understand that when Barack Obama was running and they were getting big crowds, and they weren't as big in most cases as Donald Trump's, and they didn't go that long.
[06:55:43.884 --> 06:55:44.924]  He didn't do that many events.
[06:55:45.405 --> 06:55:50.789]  And he was always paired up with a free concert from a very popular band.
[06:55:51.390 --> 06:55:53.552]  Donald Trump is doing this all by himself.
[06:55:53.792 --> 06:55:54.412]  He is the band.
[06:55:54.472 --> 06:55:58.994]  And as Joe Biggs pointed out, there are people that can't get in that still stay around.
[06:55:59.455 --> 06:56:02.416]  And this is without any advance notification.
[06:56:03.116 --> 06:56:07.278]  In most cases, you only get a day or so to know that he's going to be in a particular place.
[06:56:07.298 --> 06:56:10.980]  Everyone knew this media, this whole smear campaign was complete and total BS.
[06:56:11.440 --> 06:56:13.942]  And it really has nothing to do with what's going on.
[06:56:14.262 --> 06:56:15.503]  And all those people showed up.
[06:56:15.543 --> 06:56:18.425]  But we call out Hillary Clinton on a daily basis here.
[06:56:18.825 --> 06:56:29.052]  No one's showing up in droves outside of her campaign offices or at her home, you know, rallying around Hillary going, oh, you know, we're behind her, you know, maybe she messed up or that's completely false.
[06:56:29.072 --> 06:56:30.073]  Because no one cares.
[06:56:30.413 --> 06:56:33.275]  No one's willing to put their name behind that, really, who's an actual person.
[06:56:33.495 --> 06:56:34.396]  Except for Hollywood.
[06:56:34.716 --> 06:56:35.617]  Except for Hollywood.
[06:56:36.597 --> 06:56:44.322]  The Trump protesters that we've encountered, they're always loud and mean and aggressive and really, really rude people.
[06:56:44.382 --> 06:56:47.844]  It's unreal, you know, and there's always just a little gaggle of them.
[06:56:47.884 --> 06:56:49.145]  There are never very many of them.
[06:56:49.165 --> 06:56:49.925]  Have you noticed that?
[06:56:49.945 --> 06:56:51.206]  The anti-Trumpers?
[06:56:51.586 --> 06:56:56.189]  Yes, like five or six in a little string, sometimes 30, but it's just, she doesn't have the...
[06:56:56.769 --> 06:57:00.153]  I think one of the most interesting things about that was how few people there were to hear Bill Clinton.
[06:57:16.189 --> 06:57:17.550]  Nobody shows up for these events.
[06:57:18.211 --> 06:57:20.153]  And it's absolutely amazing to me.
[06:57:20.373 --> 06:57:22.975]  What it shows you is that her base is not energized.
[06:57:23.316 --> 06:57:25.618]  It shows you that Donald Trump's base is energized.
[06:57:25.638 --> 06:57:31.764]  And we've got other metrics that show that as well, in terms of the number of votes that he got, far more than any other Republican candidate.
[06:57:31.784 --> 06:57:39.511]  The number, the amount of money that he's raised from people giving small contributions, far more than we've ever seen from any other Republican candidate.
[06:57:39.551 --> 06:57:50.839]  I've seen citizen journalists go into these events and filming the people going inside of a Hillary Clinton event and then you have like these Hillary campaign workers who are like, alright, let's go, we're with her, and they start trying to lead these chants and claps.
[06:57:50.859 --> 06:57:53.020]  But I say Hillary, you say Clinton!
[06:57:53.160 --> 06:58:03.748]  You know what, I really don't want to be here, and I'm not really excited about being here, but when you go outside of a Trump event, everyone is chanting, you know, America, USA, build the wall, lock her up.
[06:58:04.048 --> 06:58:04.849]  Hillary for prison.
[06:58:04.869 --> 06:58:06.531]  I mean the energy that is there.
[06:58:06.551 --> 06:58:07.932]  It's like being at a revival.
[06:58:07.992 --> 06:58:12.116]  Everyone just feels energetic and they've been filled with the spirit of patriotism.
[06:58:12.256 --> 06:58:12.957]  It's pretty awesome.
[06:58:12.977 --> 06:58:18.963]  I mean even when we're able to see that they're having to close the walls in when she was there to go speak.
[06:58:19.463 --> 06:58:28.775]  In front of a lot of church groups, they had to move the walls closer to give the appearance that the room was filled much larger, with a larger audience than it was.
[06:58:28.795 --> 06:58:36.825]  I mean, this is her entire campaign, is gaming the system, rigging it all for appearances so that when, in the end, the voter is duped...
[06:58:37.910 --> 06:58:39.831]  You know, maybe we won't realize it this time around.
[06:58:54.281 --> 06:58:59.924]  And it always opens up the possibility that some outsider could take over one of the two major parties.
[06:59:00.264 --> 06:59:01.625]  That's precisely what we've seen.
[06:59:01.905 --> 06:59:06.688]  That's why the elite of both parties are concerned about this and why they're pushing so hard against Donald Trump.
[06:59:06.988 --> 06:59:08.489]  He is their worst nightmare.
[06:59:08.909 --> 06:59:12.991]  He is the outlier that they have feared for a long time and that is what's coming to pass.
[06:59:13.271 --> 06:59:14.692]  That's what you're seeing with this movement.
[06:59:14.912 --> 06:59:19.615]  He's taken over one of the major parties and a lot of people can't understand that.
[06:59:20.055 --> 06:59:22.116]  I see Jesse Ventura when he's talking about it.
[06:59:22.296 --> 06:59:23.317]  I can't vote for a Republican.
[06:59:23.537 --> 06:59:28.841]  He doesn't understand that Donald Trump has taken over the Republican Party and is going to fundamentally change it.
[06:59:28.861 --> 06:59:30.302]  That's why the Republicans hate him so much.
[06:59:30.322 --> 06:59:33.724]  All right, let's go to the next caller, Garrett in Dallas.
[06:59:34.044 --> 06:59:37.406]  He wants to talk about Hillary Clinton and NWO mentality.
[06:59:37.907 --> 06:59:38.827]  Garrett, it's all you.
[06:59:38.847 --> 06:59:40.989]  Well, thank you.
[06:59:41.589 --> 06:59:49.655]  What my point was when I said that is what ticked me off to talk about this was during the debate, Hillary said,
[06:59:50.407 --> 06:59:52.928]  We need a no-fly zone in Syria.
[06:59:53.749 --> 06:59:56.630]  The thing is that Russia already has one.
[06:59:57.551 --> 06:59:59.992]  Just like our stupid generals.
[07:00:00.472 --> 07:00:01.213]  Just like them.
[07:00:01.633 --> 07:00:05.255]  They say, you know, we can attack them and they won't attack back.
[07:00:05.995 --> 07:00:09.217]  Doing this, and she knows it, will start World War III.
[07:00:09.837 --> 07:00:10.477]  She knows this.
[07:00:10.657 --> 07:00:11.478]  They all know it.
[07:00:11.958 --> 07:00:13.759]  But they pretend that you're stupid.
[07:00:14.559 --> 07:00:17.541]  And the thing is, but some of them may be serious.
[07:00:18.502 --> 07:00:19.382]  And you probably know this.
[07:00:20.220 --> 07:00:21.360]  And they're all war mongers.
[07:00:21.800 --> 07:00:31.423]  In the leaked emails, there was this conversation with a man, he was a six man that walked on the moon or something like that.
[07:00:33.024 --> 07:00:35.364]  They're debating about war in space.
[07:00:35.604 --> 07:00:38.585]  So suddenly some kind of thing where they're planning World War III in space.
[07:00:39.545 --> 07:00:44.227]  What he said, the debate isn't about, oh, should we do this?
[07:00:44.247 --> 07:00:45.207]  Should we attack them?
[07:00:45.647 --> 07:00:46.647]  How many people will it kill?
[07:00:46.967 --> 07:00:49.288]  What the debate was and what he was saying
[07:00:49.710 --> 07:00:58.738]  And they believe this, that they are in contact with an extraterrestrial alien in the continuous universe.
[07:00:59.159 --> 07:01:03.442]  And they're saying, well, wouldn't we upset the alien if we did this?
[07:01:03.683 --> 07:01:05.024]  This is the New World Order.
[07:01:05.384 --> 07:01:09.348]  They believe that their only masters are aliens.
[07:01:10.108 --> 07:01:10.989]  Telling them to go to war.
[07:01:11.990 --> 07:01:13.051]  We need to fix these people.
[07:01:13.091 --> 07:01:13.852]  We need to get them out.
[07:01:15.253 --> 07:01:15.934]  They're mentally ill.
[07:01:16.536 --> 07:01:20.199]  Yeah, it was kind of an X-Files couple of emails, wasn't it?
[07:01:20.279 --> 07:01:25.743]  As you point out, it was from one of the former astronauts, a guy who grew up in Roswell before he became an astronaut.
[07:01:26.203 --> 07:01:28.906]  And it was a series of emails that he had sent to Podesta.
[07:01:29.586 --> 07:01:40.515]  It was interesting, Podesta did not reply to him, but when Podesta left the Obama administration, he said one of the things that he was most concerned about was the fact that he hadn't been able to release any of these extraterrestrial files.
[07:01:41.135 --> 07:01:45.378]  But what he was proposing there was something that was straight out of the day the earth stood still.
[07:01:45.398 --> 07:01:54.645]  You know, this intelligence that we have been in contact with does not want us to have any wars in space or any wars, and you know that, and we've got to keep this quiet.
[07:01:54.945 --> 07:01:56.166]  It's an interesting exchange.
[07:01:56.827 --> 07:01:58.508]  I think a lot's going to be made out of that.
[07:02:00.169 --> 07:02:00.489]  Wow.
[07:02:00.509 --> 07:02:02.251]  I missed that one.
[07:02:02.271 --> 07:02:05.693]  Alright, well, thanks Garrett for that comment.
[07:02:05.713 --> 07:02:07.615]  Let's go to Chris in Rhode Island.
[07:02:08.035 --> 07:02:09.276]  Chris, what's on your mind?
[07:02:11.192 --> 07:02:12.012]  I want to thank you guys.
[07:02:12.072 --> 07:02:13.613]  I think you're doing an excellent job.
[07:02:14.733 --> 07:02:22.354]  You're informed and you're giving the facts out in a really succinct and competent manner.
[07:02:23.535 --> 07:02:28.356]  My name is Chris Young and I do believe that the elections will be fixed.
[07:02:28.516 --> 07:02:32.737]  I ran for Congress in Rhode Island in the primary election just recently.
[07:02:33.197 --> 07:02:39.618]  That's ended, but I was told by the head of the State Board of Elections in Rhode Island that the elections are fixed.
[07:02:40.262 --> 07:02:40.762]  That's great.
[07:03:01.431 --> 07:03:05.694]  But he said, you know, it's not tolerable the things that Donald Trump said or whatever.
[07:03:06.075 --> 07:03:07.536]  I just was so disgusted by that.
[07:03:07.556 --> 07:03:12.920]  I just cannot support him in the general election, even though we share a large percentage of positions.
[07:03:13.360 --> 07:03:16.502]  Supposedly, I don't even know if he means what he says, but in any event.
[07:03:17.623 --> 07:03:28.451]  I think that you have a very large listening audience right now, and I think that what you guys could do to make it more effective, you know, the use of the audience that you have, is to get the audience to take action.
[07:03:28.871 --> 07:03:34.275]  Meaning that you could tell the audience to post the InfoWars website on their social media.
[07:03:34.715 --> 07:03:46.984]  You could also get them to post the Jeffrey Epstein story, which I think is a very important story, because I believe in about a week they'll be attacking Trump on similar issues, and I don't think that they're valid when it comes to Trump, but I do believe
[07:03:47.404 --> 07:04:07.963]  That Fox News covered the story on YouTube, this YouTube video of it, where Fox News goes over what happened on what they call Orgy Island, you know, and Jeffrey Epstein was convicted of having sex with, I think, an underage prostitute, supposedly an underage child.
[07:04:09.119 --> 07:04:13.583]  So, um, I think that you should focus on that story because I think it's a very important story.
[07:04:13.623 --> 07:04:25.232]  I think it didn't gain enough traction when it was released by Fox Media, but I think that you could push that story to your listeners right now and have them post that on their Facebook walls to counteract
[07:04:25.692 --> 07:04:26.673]  We're good to go.
[07:04:47.191 --> 07:04:47.491]  We're good.
[07:05:07.654 --> 07:05:08.315]  We're good.
[07:05:32.853 --> 07:05:42.096]  Trump being, you know, a racist or whatever, which is not valid, you know, I think that Trump could bring up her ties to Robert Baird.
[07:05:42.216 --> 07:05:44.076]  Well, those are some great points, Chris, man.
[07:05:44.096 --> 07:05:44.776]  We appreciate it.
[07:05:44.796 --> 07:05:45.917]  We're going to move on to the next call.
[07:05:46.517 --> 07:05:47.777]  Thanks for listening, as always.
[07:05:48.097 --> 07:05:50.978]  Hey, Greg in Houston, Greg in Houston, you've been holding for a while.
[07:05:50.998 --> 07:05:51.518]  Let's go to you.
[07:05:52.118 --> 07:05:53.679]  What are your thoughts on the debate tonight?
[07:05:55.099 --> 07:05:56.239]  I thought it went really well.
[07:05:56.679 --> 07:05:57.940]  I was actually a little distant.
[07:05:58.660 --> 07:05:59.260]  Yeah, it did.
[07:05:59.280 --> 07:06:02.221]  He kind of, he just slammed her on quite a few topics.
[07:06:03.144 --> 07:06:03.864]  She's a chameleon.
[07:06:33.425 --> 07:06:34.845]  And like a boardroom meeting.
[07:06:35.185 --> 07:06:38.066]  And I think that he could have been a whole lot more aggressive than he was.
[07:06:38.946 --> 07:06:53.130]  But I think if you think in terms of international or foreign policy and foreign negotiations, you're going to see the same guy that you see in this debate.
[07:06:53.732 --> 07:06:54.792]  Can I say something about that?
[07:06:55.393 --> 07:07:01.235]  I think one of the things that I thought was most interesting was when they tried to come at him with Pence.
[07:07:01.815 --> 07:07:06.077]  And they tried to say, you know, Pence is saying we had to get confrontation with the Russians in Syria and so forth.
[07:07:06.097 --> 07:07:07.838]  You know, pushing that whole idea of World War III.
[07:07:08.458 --> 07:07:10.939]  And Donald Trump wouldn't let them paint him into that corner.
[07:07:10.999 --> 07:07:13.200]  And he also showed that he was his own man.
[07:07:13.700 --> 07:07:17.862]  He came back and he says, well, I haven't talked to Governor Pence about this, but I disagree with that.
[07:07:18.927 --> 07:07:21.348]  In other words, I'm not changing my position on this.
[07:07:21.388 --> 07:07:22.208]  That's my position.
[07:07:22.489 --> 07:07:26.730]  I don't care if Pence disagrees with me or not, and you're not going to paint me in that corner.
[07:07:26.750 --> 07:07:37.494]  I thought that was a really strong moment for Donald Trump, and it shows that he's his own man, he knows what he believes, and I think he's going to stand for these principles, which are not to get us involved in World War III.
[07:07:37.534 --> 07:07:38.835]  He's got enough sense not to do that.
[07:07:38.895 --> 07:07:41.816]  He's the only one that's not going to do that.
[07:07:42.645 --> 07:07:45.228]  Clinton, Clinton, Clinton, Clinton, Clinton, Chameleon.
[07:07:45.568 --> 07:07:47.811]  I keep hearing this song in my head ever since I said chameleon.
[07:07:47.831 --> 07:07:52.096]  Back to the caller's point of we don't know who Hillary Clinton is going to be.
[07:07:52.116 --> 07:07:54.979]  We know exactly who she's going to be.
[07:07:55.059 --> 07:07:59.344]  And let me tell you, that is nothing that any of us want to see happen.
[07:08:00.044 --> 07:08:09.707]  Well, I love how she's saying that she's going to be so strong, yet whenever there's an opportunity to use the victim card and the weak card, that's what we're seeing.
[07:08:10.087 --> 07:08:13.968]  Sarah Silverman's like, look at how Trump is just standing in her space.
[07:08:14.108 --> 07:08:15.909]  Oh my gosh, he's dominating her.
[07:08:15.929 --> 07:08:21.691]  It's like, if she cannot handle a pacing Trump, what else is she not going to be able to handle?
[07:08:21.911 --> 07:08:24.772]  If that's going to rattle her, you know, Donald Trump.
[07:08:25.652 --> 07:08:27.093]  Well, it's just I'm driving home.
[07:08:27.113 --> 07:08:28.574]  I'm at a home center in my parking lot.
[07:08:28.594 --> 07:08:30.035]  Listen, you guys, the callers are incredible.
[07:08:44.469 --> 07:08:47.651]  Everything that Leanne and Margaret are saying is amazing.
[07:08:47.711 --> 07:08:48.971]  David Knight, you bigs.
[07:08:49.632 --> 07:08:51.513]  I'm just so proud to be associated with this.
[07:08:52.193 --> 07:08:53.554]  This is the best talk radio.
[07:08:53.714 --> 07:08:55.395]  This is the best live TV.
[07:08:56.095 --> 07:08:57.216]  This is so incredible.
[07:08:57.316 --> 07:08:59.597]  The Infowars.com list has built this.
[07:09:01.298 --> 07:09:05.880]  But looking at Hillary by the part of a, quote, woman, which is a psychopathic monster.
[07:09:06.641 --> 07:09:07.901]  They hate Trump because he's human.
[07:09:07.941 --> 07:09:08.682]  He's not perfect.
[07:09:08.722 --> 07:09:09.322]  He's a man.
[07:09:09.722 --> 07:09:11.023]  But he wants prosperity.
[07:09:11.698 --> 07:09:12.919]  He's not a eugenicist.
[07:09:13.079 --> 07:09:14.580]  Loveless want pain.
[07:09:15.061 --> 07:09:16.281]  They want frustration.
[07:09:16.301 --> 07:09:17.803]  They want us to be poor.
[07:09:17.843 --> 07:09:18.543]  They admit that.
[07:09:18.603 --> 07:09:22.366]  That's their eugenicist plan of austerity.
[07:09:23.286 --> 07:09:27.409]  And that's why they hate him so much, is because he's like a throwback.
[07:09:27.909 --> 07:09:30.591]  Not that strong men are great, but compared to them, they are great.
[07:09:31.152 --> 07:09:35.535]  They are crapping their pants, and it's just so good to hear these callers.
[07:09:36.115 --> 07:09:37.717]  It's so good to hear you guys talking about this.
[07:09:37.777 --> 07:09:39.478]  It's so good to see the right thing happening.
[07:09:40.058 --> 07:09:42.140]  And whether Trump wins or loses, it doesn't matter.
[07:09:42.160 --> 07:09:43.481]  They're forced to try to steal it.
[07:09:44.001 --> 07:09:48.104]  But this is the animating contest of liberty that is victory.
[07:09:50.046 --> 07:09:52.168]  I'm just so proud to be associated with all of you.
[07:09:52.628 --> 07:09:53.389]  This is amazing.
[07:09:53.409 --> 07:09:59.413]  I'm going to hand the baton back to you to take more calls, but it's just historical to be part of this and a great job you're doing.
[07:10:00.554 --> 07:10:04.037]  Indeed, this has been an historical night to remember.
[07:10:04.057 --> 07:10:06.199]  Let's go to our next caller.
[07:10:06.319 --> 07:10:07.620]  Chris in Georgia.
[07:10:07.960 --> 07:10:09.461]  Looks like he's been holding the longest.
[07:10:09.481 --> 07:10:11.363]  You have a general debate comment.
[07:10:11.703 --> 07:10:12.123]  What is that?
[07:10:13.645 --> 07:10:14.825]  Hey, how are you guys doing tonight?
[07:10:15.166 --> 07:10:15.346]  Good.
[07:10:17.560 --> 07:10:21.743]  Yeah, I noticed Hillary didn't have her googly eyes for Trump tonight.
[07:10:21.763 --> 07:10:25.025]  I think she was sealed it though.
[07:10:25.065 --> 07:10:26.946]  Bill had some googly googly eyes.
[07:10:26.966 --> 07:10:28.247]  He's like, uh oh.
[07:10:28.547 --> 07:10:30.068]  That was like the death stare.
[07:10:31.109 --> 07:10:32.690]  He's like, no he didn't, he said it!
[07:10:34.231 --> 07:10:37.693]  Surprised he didn't draw his finger across his throat like George H.W.
[07:10:37.713 --> 07:10:37.973]  Bush did.
[07:10:37.993 --> 07:10:41.755]  I'm surprised he didn't break out a mirror and start doing lines of coke or something right there in the debate.
[07:10:45.285 --> 07:10:48.810]  Oh man, when you have three victims like that in a row, I can only imagine.
[07:10:58.837 --> 07:11:01.319]  You know, he really hit Hillary hard today.
[07:11:01.359 --> 07:11:02.440]  We still got one more debate.
[07:11:02.460 --> 07:11:07.564]  We can't do everything because then she's going to know everything that he's got and what he's going to use.
[07:11:07.604 --> 07:11:09.826]  So I think this was a good second debate.
[07:11:09.866 --> 07:11:18.212]  This was a good progression towards that third final blowout when he comes in, completely dominates, gets all up in her space and just wins.
[07:11:19.013 --> 07:11:24.396]  Well, I think, too, you know, Trump kind of delivered a pretty potent message to the press as well.
[07:11:24.436 --> 07:11:28.959]  Like, look, really, this is the story you're going to take and run with because it's scandalous.
[07:11:29.399 --> 07:11:33.842]  It sells those smut newspapers that we see at the grocery store line.
[07:11:34.202 --> 07:11:37.504]  I mean, this is what they're going to use to try and take Trump down.
[07:11:37.564 --> 07:11:38.425]  So he said, you know what?
[07:11:38.445 --> 07:11:43.788]  Look, guys, I'm just going to go ahead and hold my own press conference that everyone's going to be talking about.
[07:11:44.108 --> 07:11:45.830]  And I'm going to sit these ladies in the front row.
[07:11:46.650 --> 07:11:56.597]  He's just shining so bright tonight that next week for the next debate I will be wearing my welding helmet because he's gonna be shining so hard that I don't want to go blind just from that awesomeness happening.
[07:11:59.560 --> 07:12:13.990]  I'm reading some of these tweets and I'm kind of getting trolled at the moment here guys so Maggie no matter how much tweets you report we all know that that Clinton is going to steal this, steal the win and I just want people to know we don't we don't believe that.
[07:12:14.010 --> 07:12:14.751]  It'll be the Russians.
[07:12:17.293 --> 07:12:18.254]  Rigged debate?
[07:12:18.294 --> 07:12:18.895]  What is that?
[07:12:18.955 --> 07:12:20.036]  What does that even mean?
[07:12:20.056 --> 07:12:21.197]  No, seriously.
[07:12:21.817 --> 07:12:27.903]  You know, I get trolled, but in this case, you know, when it's blatant like this, I need a good comeback.
[07:12:27.983 --> 07:12:30.445]  Banks is the master of comebacks, by the way.
[07:12:30.466 --> 07:12:30.526]  Yes.
[07:12:30.646 --> 07:12:35.730]  Let me respond to that and say that, you know, if they completely controlled everything,
[07:12:36.653 --> 07:12:41.200]  Then we wouldn't have Donald Trump as the nominee at this point because they didn't want that to happen.
[07:12:41.340 --> 07:12:47.529]  I think that if it's a close election, they can rig the election in some key places and turn it.
[07:12:47.549 --> 07:12:49.312]  We've seen that happen historically in the past.
[07:12:49.352 --> 07:12:51.575]  That's what we have to be aware of and guard against.
[07:12:52.136 --> 07:13:02.478]  But if it is an overwhelming victory, and that can happen if the people who support Donald Trump turn up, in that case what they'll do is they'll back off and they'll fight him another day in another way.
[07:13:02.618 --> 07:13:11.960]  What they'll try to do is load up his administration with people from the Council on Foreign Relations, as they did with Ronald Reagan, to try to neuter his administration, to try to take it over.
[07:13:12.280 --> 07:13:17.841]  I think it's very important that people understand that we know that they're criminals, we know
[07:13:17.841 --> 07:13:21.423]  I know they're capable of doing election fraud, but we cannot give up.
[07:13:21.723 --> 07:13:25.785]  We have to fight this thing, and we can win this, even with that election fraud.
[07:13:26.045 --> 07:13:27.506]  We don't need to get caught, but we don't need to just give up.
[07:13:27.546 --> 07:13:30.207]  It's going to be a battle line on November 8th to see all these Trump supporters.
[07:13:30.227 --> 07:13:31.788]  You're going to see everyone come out of their shell.
[07:13:32.228 --> 07:13:34.449]  People who normally wouldn't say anything, because that's the final day.
[07:13:34.969 --> 07:13:35.529]  That's the day.
[07:13:35.629 --> 07:13:39.252]  I mean, if you're a closet Trump supporter right now, that's your day to shine.
[07:13:39.632 --> 07:13:40.433]  Put on that sticker.
[07:13:40.473 --> 07:13:42.054]  Put on that Make America Great Again hat.
[07:13:42.134 --> 07:13:45.536]  Come out there in full force and show your support.
[07:13:45.876 --> 07:13:47.357]  You know, that's going to be the time to do it.
[07:13:47.377 --> 07:13:48.998]  That's going to be the time to take America back.
[07:13:49.379 --> 07:13:50.319]  That's going to be 1776.
[07:13:50.439 --> 07:13:56.644]  And especially if your state participates in early voting, that is so important.
[07:13:56.664 --> 07:13:59.025]  If you can get out there and vote early, you've got to do that.
[07:13:59.085 --> 07:14:04.189]  I think that's going to represent something like 40 percent of the votes and really just kind of show people
[07:14:05.229 --> 07:14:11.416]  What's actually happening real in the scene before they're able to rig the election or whatever they're able to do in the election booth?
[07:14:11.707 --> 07:14:19.390]  I mean, you've got 60,000 Democrats switching over to Republican to vote for Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, you know, in other states as well.
[07:14:19.570 --> 07:14:24.112]  And you've got people who never haven't voted for decades or maybe never registered to vote that are part of this process.
[07:14:24.532 --> 07:14:34.717]  Even if they were being legitimate about these polls, their polls would not include those new voters who had been disgusted about the situation in the past and never participated.
[07:14:35.177 --> 07:14:44.544]  And isn't it so interesting how all these establishment GOP members were so quick to jump ship, like this was their red line in the sand with Trump.
[07:14:45.224 --> 07:14:50.008]  Meanwhile, only I think 12% of his supporters said, OK, finally, enough is enough.
[07:14:50.088 --> 07:14:51.909]  I mean, he has so much support now.
[07:14:52.270 --> 07:14:56.393]  And then I think with this debate just kind of showed all of those establishment
[07:14:57.253 --> 07:14:59.854]  Members, like, don't count them out just yet.
[07:15:00.054 --> 07:15:03.274]  But, I mean, they're really showing all their cards in this election.
[07:15:03.314 --> 07:15:08.355]  This really is, like, such an exciting time to be so involved in a presidential debate election.
[07:15:08.375 --> 07:15:11.236]  Alright, Teresa in Arizona, you are up.
[07:15:11.276 --> 07:15:13.216]  What is your question for the InfoWars crew?
[07:15:15.256 --> 07:15:17.237]  Alright, well, hi you guys.
[07:15:17.917 --> 07:15:21.157]  Congratulations, you guys are doing a good radio show tonight.
[07:15:22.718 --> 07:15:23.478]  Why thank you very much.
[07:15:24.744 --> 07:15:26.245]  Oh there you are!
[07:15:26.306 --> 07:15:38.417]  Hey, I wanted to say, it makes me so mad when Hillary says, you know, just like my best friend Michelle Obama says, when they go low, we go high, and I was thinking,
[07:15:39.124 --> 07:15:40.665]  You know, lady, you're in the gutter.
[07:15:40.685 --> 07:15:44.987]  You're going to need a big ladder to go high, you know?
[07:15:45.167 --> 07:15:49.669]  And I just loved how Trump just dominated the whole thing.
[07:15:50.609 --> 07:16:01.575]  Leigh-Anne and I were listening to that and Leigh-Anne said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, it was so funny to watch her reaction to Hillary's, we go higher when you go low comment.
[07:16:01.615 --> 07:16:05.957]  It's like, lady, you couldn't go any lower if you tried, actually.
[07:16:07.267 --> 07:16:10.649]  Yeah, and I love how Trump pointed out the fact that they're not friends.
[07:16:10.769 --> 07:16:15.972]  Like, come on, this little act that you've got going on that you guys are best buddies and Obama thinks you're so... Oh yeah, Michelle has said it many a time.
[07:16:15.992 --> 07:16:17.233]  She doesn't like the Clintons.
[07:16:17.253 --> 07:16:18.754]  They don't even like to hang out together.
[07:16:18.774 --> 07:16:21.035]  She's just pandering like she always does.
[07:16:21.916 --> 07:16:22.376]  Exactly.
[07:16:22.396 --> 07:16:25.638]  And this is what they have to do, and that's why nobody trusts any of them.
[07:16:27.119 --> 07:16:27.459]  Yeah.
[07:16:28.040 --> 07:16:28.340]  Yeah.
[07:16:29.380 --> 07:16:31.141]  But anyway, I thought it was great.
[07:16:31.181 --> 07:16:32.022]  I thought that Trump
[07:16:32.742 --> 07:16:38.943]  He did an excellent job tonight, considering, you know, maybe this was his whole plan.
[07:16:38.963 --> 07:16:43.024]  Because the last time we were all worried about him, this time he upped his game.
[07:16:43.064 --> 07:16:44.884]  So now he's like sitting there in the middle.
[07:16:44.944 --> 07:16:53.486]  Now he's positioned himself to, you know, really get her, really, really go for the jugular.
[07:16:53.646 --> 07:16:55.726]  And you know what I was so proud of him about?
[07:16:55.746 --> 07:16:58.267]  He not only dominated, but
[07:16:59.062 --> 07:17:00.483]  He kept his composure.
[07:17:00.503 --> 07:17:02.644]  He didn't make any faces this time.
[07:17:02.965 --> 07:17:08.388]  He was just so presidential and just so, you know, he was just great.
[07:17:10.109 --> 07:17:14.132]  Well, thank you, Teresa, for calling into the InfoWars debate coverage.
[07:17:14.572 --> 07:17:15.353]  We appreciate it.
[07:17:15.673 --> 07:17:21.056]  Let's go ahead and go to our next caller, Karen, who is in Arizona as well.
[07:17:21.657 --> 07:17:22.778]  Karen, how's it going?
[07:17:23.658 --> 07:17:24.179]  Great!
[07:17:24.419 --> 07:17:25.680]  This is the coolest night ever.
[07:17:26.020 --> 07:17:27.581]  Not only did I watch Trump,
[07:17:28.283 --> 07:17:29.284]  Dominate Hillary.
[07:17:29.324 --> 07:17:32.846]  But I get to talk to all the reporters at Infowars.
[07:17:32.986 --> 07:17:33.866]  I love you guys.
[07:17:34.567 --> 07:17:35.487]  I pray for you.
[07:17:35.547 --> 07:17:37.368]  I go to bed at night with Infowars on.
[07:17:37.469 --> 07:17:38.989]  It's the first thing I turn on in the morning.
[07:17:39.049 --> 07:17:41.951]  So this is the coolest night ever for me.
[07:17:41.971 --> 07:17:42.792]  It was just really good.
[07:17:43.132 --> 07:17:45.553]  But I did say I was going to be a devil's advocate for Hillary.
[07:17:45.573 --> 07:17:46.894]  So I'm going to give it my best shot.
[07:17:48.035 --> 07:17:50.236]  I'm not used to being a woman with no conscience.
[07:17:50.276 --> 07:17:51.577]  So it's a little hard to go there.
[07:17:52.615 --> 07:18:05.160]  But if I was Hillary, with all of her crimes that have been exposed in the media, all of them, and the way Trump handled her, I would have been twitching on the floor with seizures.
[07:18:06.261 --> 07:18:07.341]  So I give her some credit.
[07:18:07.501 --> 07:18:08.141]  She stood.
[07:18:08.161 --> 07:18:09.982]  Or rolling around chewing the carpet.
[07:18:11.023 --> 07:18:13.904]  Yeah, I was waiting for her to start a coughing fit or something.
[07:18:13.944 --> 07:18:14.964]  He hit her so hard.
[07:18:17.349 --> 07:18:19.972]  I'm glad you said that, but I'm just being honest that if I took the blows that she took
[07:18:33.832 --> 07:18:34.592]  It would have broke me.
[07:18:34.712 --> 07:18:36.953]  I would have been in a corner rocking myself.
[07:18:36.973 --> 07:18:41.895]  He mastered her and he did it in a, in a, in a, I don't know if the kind word.
[07:18:42.015 --> 07:18:44.255]  He was gracious to her still.
[07:18:44.355 --> 07:18:46.736]  Yes, in a respectful way.
[07:18:46.896 --> 07:18:49.077]  He, he went, I'm, I'm so proud.
[07:18:49.257 --> 07:18:51.618]  And, and I, we all have to really pray for him.
[07:18:52.058 --> 07:18:52.978]  He's under assault.
[07:18:53.038 --> 07:18:54.038]  You guys are under assault.
[07:18:54.499 --> 07:18:58.880]  This is a, this is really historic time and I'm so grateful to get on the radio.
[07:18:58.900 --> 07:19:00.260]  I can't even believe it.
[07:19:00.320 --> 07:19:01.521]  You guys are so awesome.
[07:19:03.277 --> 07:19:04.618]  Well, thanks for calling in.
[07:19:04.678 --> 07:19:05.518]  We appreciate it.
[07:19:05.538 --> 07:19:06.739]  It was a good talking to you, Karen.
[07:19:07.099 --> 07:19:08.980]  Let's go to Marcus in Texas.
[07:19:09.280 --> 07:19:10.721]  He wants to congratulate Trump.
[07:19:10.761 --> 07:19:11.641]  Marcus, let's hear it.
[07:19:12.862 --> 07:19:14.122]  Well, thank you, Joe.
[07:19:14.162 --> 07:19:14.923]  You're my hero.
[07:19:15.303 --> 07:19:16.644]  And David, you're a genius.
[07:19:16.744 --> 07:19:17.924]  I want to say something about that.
[07:19:18.224 --> 07:19:25.448]  But yes, Trump will put the government back to work like it's supposed to be with a functioning head.
[07:19:25.868 --> 07:19:27.169]  Right now, we just don't have that.
[07:19:28.345 --> 07:19:33.366]  But, David, the reason I say you're a genius is because of what you said about the Republican Party.
[07:19:34.547 --> 07:19:42.469]  The Republican Party is the wall that Joshua would have attacked to get to the enemy behind the wall.
[07:19:44.389 --> 07:19:48.790]  When the people get tired of the Democrat, they vote him out.
[07:19:49.450 --> 07:19:55.692]  But the Republican, without an agenda, sits in the seat until the
[07:19:56.633 --> 07:20:00.694]  Until the pressure passes and the Democrat can get back in and resume what they're doing.
[07:20:01.535 --> 07:20:07.676]  If Trump chases the rhinos out, then he'll hand the Republican Party back to the people.
[07:20:07.977 --> 07:20:10.377]  The wall will have been conquered.
[07:20:12.118 --> 07:20:13.698]  And it's simple.
[07:20:13.818 --> 07:20:18.320]  Once the wall is down, the people have access to the Democrats.
[07:20:19.740 --> 07:20:20.781]  Because right now, we don't.
[07:20:20.801 --> 07:20:22.041]  Republicans are in the way.
[07:20:23.084 --> 07:20:23.624]  Yes, sir.
[07:20:24.045 --> 07:20:27.787]  Well, David's not here right now, but I will let him know that you said he's a genius.
[07:20:27.927 --> 07:20:29.829]  I believe the same thing.
[07:20:29.869 --> 07:20:34.492]  I think David Knight is an extremely brilliant man, and I love working with him.
[07:20:34.552 --> 07:20:37.694]  I always can learn something new from him every day.
[07:20:37.734 --> 07:20:40.015]  It's almost like just sitting down, like, I just want to go in there.
[07:20:40.095 --> 07:20:40.836]  It's been so long.
[07:20:40.856 --> 07:20:41.136]  Yeah, I know.
[07:20:41.156 --> 07:20:43.458]  I just want to go sit there and see what I can learn from him every day.
[07:20:43.978 --> 07:20:45.619]  I come into the office like, what do you think about this?
[07:20:45.639 --> 07:20:46.660]  And I have to pick his brain.
[07:20:46.680 --> 07:20:52.844]  That's one of the cool things that I get to have working here is I can actually go to David Knight and pick his brain about stuff.
[07:20:52.964 --> 07:21:01.571]  I remember the first time I got on the air with David, I was so nervous because I've listened to David for so, you know, I actually, I listen to David and I really, you know, love David.
[07:21:01.591 --> 07:21:09.938]  I remember the first time I got on the desk with David, I was trying not to show him how nervous I was because of that massive brain that you mentioned earlier, but he is, and you're a hero too.
[07:21:10.098 --> 07:21:10.478]  He's great.
[07:21:10.518 --> 07:21:10.979]  Well, thank you.
[07:21:11.659 --> 07:21:15.622]  Well, Marcus, we appreciate your call and thanks for listening to the show.
[07:21:15.983 --> 07:21:17.924]  Next, we're going to go to James in Texas.
[07:21:17.944 --> 07:21:19.365]  We've got a lot of people from Texas calling.
[07:21:19.846 --> 07:21:21.187]  James, what is on your mind?
[07:21:22.865 --> 07:21:22.885]  I
[07:21:53.787 --> 07:21:56.289]  And George Soros, I can't believe that was mentioned.
[07:21:56.509 --> 07:22:01.872]  I mean, I can imagine him sitting in his million-dollar chair just biting his nails right now.
[07:22:01.972 --> 07:22:22.182]  But what's really awesome is, you know, I think we need to thank the Lord for giving Trump this victory and giving him the strength and encouragement to stand up to this and putting you guys in the positions that you're in to be able to wake people up to what's really going on.
[07:22:23.925 --> 07:22:31.628]  I'm sure the Lord has a very funny way with words and wordplay in history.
[07:22:32.328 --> 07:22:41.351]  If you notice, Trump, you know, it talks about the last Trump of God, and it doesn't say Trumpet.
[07:22:41.431 --> 07:22:43.932]  It actually just says Trump, at the last Trump.
[07:22:44.552 --> 07:22:50.034]  But then you take Mike Pence, you put Trump Pence, it sounds a lot like Trumpet, doesn't it?
[07:22:50.054 --> 07:22:51.414]  Yeah.
[07:22:53.359 --> 07:23:01.641]  So I think the nation, I think this election is really, and it also explains the polarization and the anger going on right now.
[07:23:02.282 --> 07:23:11.944]  Matthew 24 10 says that many will be offended and shall betray one another and hate one another.
[07:23:11.964 --> 07:23:14.525]  He can't deny that's what's going on.
[07:23:14.545 --> 07:23:19.747]  I mean, but the main thing I wanted to say is I think this election is,
[07:23:21.953 --> 07:23:22.540]  A decision.
[07:23:22.560 --> 07:23:23.672]  I think it's the last.
[07:23:25.487 --> 07:23:27.148]  The fate of America rests in this election.
[07:23:27.188 --> 07:23:29.768]  It is definitely a historic time right here.
[07:23:29.788 --> 07:23:31.589]  It's crazy to be a part of it.
[07:23:31.749 --> 07:23:32.009]  Margaret?
[07:23:32.189 --> 07:23:36.071]  You know, James, you mentioned Trump's strength, and I'm also really impressed with that.
[07:23:36.191 --> 07:23:40.332]  I see this guy, he's not a young man at all, but he seems very, very strong.
[07:23:40.372 --> 07:23:48.775]  And you know, we've covered Trump rallies and Trump events where Trump is present, and he really has such a strong presence about him.
[07:23:48.795 --> 07:23:53.216]  It's like a magnetic force field, almost.
[07:23:53.316 --> 07:23:54.837]  It's crazy to actually get close
[07:23:55.037 --> 07:24:03.339]  It reminds me of the Chappelle Show when Prince walks in and there's this glowing aura around him.
[07:24:03.359 --> 07:24:03.559]  Exactly!
[07:24:03.739 --> 07:24:04.619]  I'm not joking.
[07:24:05.179 --> 07:24:09.100]  We literally, and I've been several rows back in an event where he's speaking.
[07:24:09.640 --> 07:24:12.661]  The man has this strength, he projects such strength.
[07:24:12.821 --> 07:24:15.242]  It's literally like a magnetic force field.
[07:24:15.382 --> 07:24:16.642]  Everybody in the room can feel it.
[07:24:17.202 --> 07:24:23.564]  And you touched on it, which is shocking because we're not talking about a particularly young man, but there's something about him that is so strong.
[07:24:23.644 --> 07:24:24.584]  It's just so strong.
[07:24:24.684 --> 07:24:28.646]  Well think about this, he goes day in and day out, from state to state, from city to city.
[07:24:28.666 --> 07:24:29.646]  He's doing rallies while she's resting.
[07:24:29.666 --> 07:24:45.554]  While she's sleeping, she's taking days off, weeks off, hiding from the media, not doing anything, and yet she's still so winded, so tired, so weak, that she can't even go to a 9-11 memorial and stand up long enough without having to have, you know, your little ambulance come and sweep her up and, you know, get another injection.
[07:24:46.254 --> 07:24:49.255]  This guy is tirelessly fighting for America.
[07:24:49.655 --> 07:24:52.517]  Trump is out there every day like the soldiers on the battlefield.
[07:24:52.557 --> 07:24:53.837]  He's like a steel tank.
[07:24:53.977 --> 07:24:54.297]  Yeah, I know.
[07:24:54.337 --> 07:24:54.877]  He really is.
[07:24:55.018 --> 07:25:02.340]  And every time you hit him, he gets stronger and stronger and stronger and learns and grows and moves forward and continues to dominate.
[07:25:02.720 --> 07:25:04.421]  So I want to thank you for your call, James.
[07:25:04.481 --> 07:25:05.702]  It was awesome to talk to you.
[07:25:06.102 --> 07:25:08.883]  Next, let's go to, let me see who the next caller is.
[07:25:09.303 --> 07:25:10.183]  Eric in Missouri.
[07:25:10.203 --> 07:25:11.404]  You've been on there for a long time.
[07:25:11.544 --> 07:25:14.325]  Eric, what is your question and or comment?
[07:25:14.945 --> 07:25:17.328]  I've got a couple of comments.
[07:25:17.468 --> 07:25:26.279]  Today, I was still undecided on who I wanted to become president, but after seeing the debate today with Donald Trump,
[07:25:26.900 --> 07:25:38.169]  Just slamming Hillary Clinton to the ground and the way that she responded to the African-American that asked how you're going to bring back the country and because it's undivided.
[07:25:38.810 --> 07:25:42.773]  Instead of saying African-American, she was sitting there saying colored people.
[07:25:44.554 --> 07:25:51.500]  And this is the same woman that was on national television saying that African-Americans were super predators.
[07:25:52.100 --> 07:25:53.363]  She wants to bring him to heel.
[07:25:53.383 --> 07:25:58.953]  The public is going to believe that she's not racist when she's dropping comments like that.
[07:25:58.973 --> 07:26:01.377]  She'll bring him to heel with a hot sauce in her pocketbook, right?
[07:26:01.598 --> 07:26:02.540]  Mhm, exactly.
[07:26:02.860 --> 07:26:03.581]  Pandering Clinton.
[07:26:05.074 --> 07:26:09.557]  Dave, the whole house where I live, we came unglued, so we were supporting Trump.
[07:26:10.258 --> 07:26:12.980]  And we are so proud to have him as a president.
[07:26:13.680 --> 07:26:16.202]  So my question is, why were you on the fence about Trump?
[07:26:16.222 --> 07:26:21.946]  What were some of the things that you kind of maybe didn't like about him, but tonight solidified your vote for him?
[07:26:22.347 --> 07:26:29.652]  When he first come out in the Republican Party against Cruz, Bush, and Rand Paul, and all those guys.
[07:26:30.365 --> 07:26:35.569]  Just the way he presented himself, he kind of came across as an a-hole, you know what I'm saying?
[07:26:36.450 --> 07:26:37.951]  That was my opinion of him.
[07:26:38.492 --> 07:26:46.418]  But as I've watched him come up in this debate, he's really turned himself around and looked like a president would.
[07:26:48.373 --> 07:26:50.374]  In my opinion, so to speak.
[07:26:50.774 --> 07:27:03.238]  He's always talking about how he wants to bring back the country, and I really think that him and Sheriff Clark from Wisconsin, he's getting a lot of insight from him on that ordeal.
[07:27:04.659 --> 07:27:05.419]  I really do.
[07:27:07.206 --> 07:27:08.367]  Those are some good points, Eric.
[07:27:08.387 --> 07:27:09.147]  We appreciate it.
[07:27:09.167 --> 07:27:10.008]  Thanks for calling in.
[07:27:10.328 --> 07:27:11.649]  Thanks for listening to our coverage.
[07:27:11.689 --> 07:27:12.810]  Thanks for watching the debate.
[07:27:13.250 --> 07:27:14.932]  And welcome to the Trump Train.
[07:27:15.352 --> 07:27:17.194]  Now we're going to go to Robert in California.
[07:27:17.214 --> 07:27:18.435]  You've been on for quite some time.
[07:27:18.735 --> 07:27:22.218]  You're saying YouTube shuts down InfoWars seconds at a time.
[07:27:22.638 --> 07:27:23.639]  Tell us what you got to say, Robert.
[07:27:24.673 --> 07:27:37.904]  Yes, I watched both debates on your live feed on YouTube, and they would have the show go for like 10 seconds and then shut it off the first debate, and this one tonight, they would keep coming back.
[07:27:37.984 --> 07:27:39.906]  But this one tonight, I had to reset it.
[07:27:40.868 --> 07:27:45.832]  Every 15 seconds or so and lose a lot of the feed just to get it back on.
[07:27:46.273 --> 07:27:48.254]  And then they kept doing that through the whole show.
[07:27:48.695 --> 07:27:51.977]  So you can tell that it's control of the Internet and all that.
[07:27:52.017 --> 07:27:53.579]  YouTube's definitely censoring us.
[07:27:53.639 --> 07:27:57.382]  I mean, if we have a title or a video that has anything that says radical Islam or...
[07:27:57.902 --> 07:27:58.362]  I don't think so.
[07:28:16.650 --> 07:28:17.371]  They took it down.
[07:28:17.451 --> 07:28:22.694]  Oh yeah, immediately because they were on the YouTube stage with a sink or whatever from the Young Turks.
[07:28:22.955 --> 07:28:26.837]  They automatically took those videos down.
[07:28:26.877 --> 07:28:28.118]  It was like multiple videos.
[07:28:28.919 --> 07:28:33.002]  I mean come on because you disagree with something that's supposed to be what America stands for.
[07:28:33.222 --> 07:28:39.526]  Plus it's come out that Hillary Clinton has spent a million dollars to form an army of trolls.
[07:28:40.287 --> 07:28:47.295]  That's right, so she has all these trolls out there that are going into the comments sections on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and all that.
[07:28:47.315 --> 07:28:50.038]  So they're not even real people, they're just paid trolls.
[07:28:50.379 --> 07:28:53.923]  Well if they have the amount of low energy that she has, I don't think there's anything to worry about.
[07:28:53.943 --> 07:28:59.509]  Hey, by the way, I was just told that we had a total of 18,000 callers so far tonight.
[07:28:59.529 --> 07:28:59.689]  Wow!
[07:29:00.791 --> 07:29:01.051]  Yep.
[07:29:01.071 --> 07:29:01.432]  18,000 callers.
[07:29:01.452 --> 07:29:06.498]  Thank you all for wanting to join us in this conversation about the debate tonight.
[07:29:06.578 --> 07:29:07.519]  We really love you.
[07:29:07.539 --> 07:29:08.521]  We appreciate you.
[07:29:08.921 --> 07:29:10.263]  You're the reason why we do this.
[07:29:10.483 --> 07:29:11.525]  We really love these people.
[07:29:11.565 --> 07:29:12.406]  We love this country.
[07:29:13.187 --> 07:29:15.810]  We don't want to see it go to hell, frankly.
[07:29:16.656 --> 07:29:19.617]  No one's calling in energetic like this about Hillary Clinton right now.
[07:29:20.358 --> 07:29:27.801]  If we could tune into all these shows, it's just like, oh, you know, Donald Trump really, you know, but it's just going to be so low energy.
[07:29:27.861 --> 07:29:29.322]  Like here, it's high energy.
[07:29:29.362 --> 07:29:30.443]  We know what we want.
[07:29:30.583 --> 07:29:31.723]  This is true Americana.
[07:29:31.743 --> 07:29:32.784]  This is true patriotism.
[07:29:33.104 --> 07:29:34.725]  Everybody here wants to be behind Trump.
[07:29:35.805 --> 07:29:36.725]  Push America forward.
[07:29:36.745 --> 07:29:37.706]  The wealth creator.
[07:29:37.846 --> 07:29:38.026]  Exactly.
[07:29:38.046 --> 07:29:39.486]  Americanism, not globalism.
[07:29:39.566 --> 07:29:40.267]  I love that.
[07:29:40.287 --> 07:29:41.327]  That's the best quote, yeah.
[07:29:41.867 --> 07:29:42.928]  I love that video that we have.
[07:29:42.948 --> 07:29:44.888]  Alright, let's go ahead and take another call.
[07:29:45.308 --> 07:29:46.969]  Sorry, I don't have my glasses on right now.
[07:29:46.989 --> 07:29:49.090]  You know, after numerous concussions, you can barely see.
[07:29:49.130 --> 07:29:53.071]  I feel like I have the eyes of a 90-year-old Hillary Clinton or something.
[07:29:53.892 --> 07:29:56.252]  Carlos in Montreal, Canada.
[07:29:57.233 --> 07:29:58.553]  Let's go ahead and take your call.
[07:29:58.853 --> 07:30:02.034]  Welcome to the InfoWars debate coverage.
[07:30:02.375 --> 07:30:02.875]  What are your thoughts?
[07:30:03.735 --> 07:30:04.456]  Thank you very much.
[07:30:04.516 --> 07:30:05.997]  I'm one of the 18,000.
[07:30:06.417 --> 07:30:11.680]  I won't take much of your time, but I think I want to add to the good news tonight.
[07:30:12.601 --> 07:30:21.647]  Every time I hear the word Russia coming from the debate, I'm reminded of an article that appeared in the New York Times.
[07:30:22.187 --> 07:30:23.047]  Please take it down.
[07:30:23.528 --> 07:30:24.729]  April 23rd, 2015.
[07:30:25.689 --> 07:30:33.054]  And the headline was cash flowed to Clinton Foundation amid Russian uranium deal.
[07:30:34.198 --> 07:30:57.920]  The deal was that Rosatom, a Russian company, a state-owned company, effectively bought into a company called Uranium One, a Canadian company, but because they were buying into a huge uranium material percentage, it needed the approval from the Secretary of State at the time, Hillary Clinton.
[07:30:58.562 --> 07:31:09.691]  And while this transaction was taking place, money flowed to the foundation that was run by the Clintons, as well as it flowed to the Canadian company's chairman, etc.
[07:31:10.372 --> 07:31:22.481]  And it's something that was well documented, very well researched, and it was carried by the New York Times on April 23rd, 2015, written by Joe Becker and Mike McIntyre.
[07:31:23.971 --> 07:31:39.582]  For that not to have been a point made during debates indicating that, in fact, Hillary Clinton has been doing a lot more business than Donald Trump with Russia, is something that is an opportunity missed.
[07:31:39.722 --> 07:31:49.729]  And it's actually quite disturbing because through this, Rosatom became one of the largest, if not the largest, holder of uranium in the world.
[07:31:50.539 --> 07:32:02.825]  And the article acknowledges that, giving credit to Russia and Putin for actually making the deal of the century for Russia in the strategic resource.
[07:32:02.845 --> 07:32:05.807]  All right, well, thanks for that info.
[07:32:06.207 --> 07:32:07.567]  I've got another question for you.
[07:32:08.308 --> 07:32:11.469]  What are people in Canada right now thinking about American politics right now?
[07:32:11.509 --> 07:32:13.610]  Like, what's the buzz going on right now?
[07:32:13.650 --> 07:32:14.851]  Like, what is everyone talking about?
[07:32:14.911 --> 07:32:17.392]  Are a lot of people kind of for Trump or Hillary?
[07:32:17.452 --> 07:32:18.753]  I mean, what's everyone thinking?
[07:32:19.548 --> 07:32:25.251]  Well, the joke is that Canadians are Americans without guns and with Medicare.
[07:32:26.871 --> 07:32:27.852]  But we love America.
[07:32:28.672 --> 07:32:31.934]  I think the overall majority of people in Canada care very much.
[07:32:32.414 --> 07:32:33.635]  We're in a free trade agreement.
[07:32:34.015 --> 07:32:42.539]  We respect the state of the Union and we care for our Mexican friends in the South.
[07:32:42.939 --> 07:32:43.219]  I think
[07:32:44.244 --> 07:32:47.866]  Canada is very open to whomever the Americans choose for president.
[07:32:47.926 --> 07:32:51.807]  I don't think that you can say that we favor one over the other.
[07:32:51.867 --> 07:33:00.271]  What we do want is truthfulness, integrity, and a commitment to the betterment, not just of Americans, but their neighbors.
[07:33:00.951 --> 07:33:05.512]  And your neighbors, and the people that can actually make the world more peaceful.
[07:33:06.073 --> 07:33:11.794]  We win at the great expenses in military engagement.
[07:33:12.154 --> 07:33:17.036]  Instead of building, we're using our plowshares to build tanks, if you know what I mean.
[07:33:17.216 --> 07:33:17.597]  Yes, sir.
[07:33:17.637 --> 07:33:19.619]  Well, thank you, Carlos, for these comments.
[07:33:20.120 --> 07:33:21.201]  Thank you for calling in.
[07:33:21.222 --> 07:33:23.565]  We're going to have to go to a quick commercial break.
[07:33:23.825 --> 07:33:31.516]  This has been the Infowars debate coverage, the second presidential debate that I believe Donald Trump just completely and totally dominated.
[07:33:31.796 --> 07:33:32.998]  He did everything I thought he would do.
[07:33:33.038 --> 07:33:33.538]  He came out.
[07:33:34.588 --> 07:33:37.711]  Harder, he came out, he fought a little bit more, more confident.
[07:33:37.751 --> 07:33:38.652]  He showed up tonight.
[07:33:38.773 --> 07:33:39.333]  Exactly.
[07:33:39.373 --> 07:33:46.941]  It's the Trump we wanted to see, the Trump we wanted to see the first debate, but I think he's doing it the right way because that third and final debate will be the one that everyone remembers.
[07:33:46.961 --> 07:33:47.602]  The death blow.
[07:33:47.662 --> 07:33:51.006]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to commercial break and we'll be back in just a little bit.
[07:33:57.162 --> 07:34:01.324]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[07:34:20.561 --> 07:34:27.645]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[07:34:28.025 --> 07:34:41.232]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[07:34:54.067 --> 07:35:00.034]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[07:35:23.095 --> 07:35:24.997]  I train two, three times a day.
[07:35:25.777 --> 07:35:26.358]  They're brutal.
[07:35:27.862 --> 07:35:30.063]  Agonizing, painful training sessions.
[07:35:34.985 --> 07:35:36.426]  I have to have the edge over my opponents.
[07:35:37.246 --> 07:35:42.428]  I believe that in fours products, super male vitality, you know, that gives me the edge.
[07:35:44.269 --> 07:35:45.289]  You have to know where you break.
[07:35:45.629 --> 07:35:48.991]  You know, ultimately, like, you don't push yourself to know where that breaking point is.
[07:35:49.191 --> 07:35:51.672]  You're always going to be falling short of what your potential is.
[07:35:52.172 --> 07:35:54.053]  So it's really just about finding
[07:35:57.102 --> 07:35:57.903]  How far you can go.
[07:36:14.860 --> 07:36:16.142]  There's a lot of different things out there.
[07:36:17.223 --> 07:36:18.124]  I only use the best.
[07:36:21.059 --> 07:36:26.141]  With the election just around the corner, I have to ask, have you gotten your Hillary for Prison t-shirt yet?
[07:36:26.661 --> 07:36:29.963]  After the election, this t-shirt will no longer be available.

[07:36:42.188 --> 07:36:46.510]  This is a meme that is still viral worldwide, Hillary for Prison.
[07:36:46.810 --> 07:36:52.532]  Folks, we want to see Hillary Clinton put in prison, and we also want to see InfoWars go to the next level.
[07:36:52.832 --> 07:36:54.012]  Help us accomplish both.

[07:37:26.616 --> 07:37:30.900]  Americanism, not globalism will be our credo!
[07:37:33.562 --> 07:37:35.564]  Americanism, not globalism!
[07:37:48.067 --> 07:37:55.594]  And welcome back to the Info Wars debate coverage where we sat down and broke down the aftermath of the second presidential debate.
[07:37:55.894 --> 07:37:58.997]  A debate that I think is going to stick in people's minds for a long time.
[07:37:59.017 --> 07:37:59.537]  What do you think, Duke?
[07:37:59.677 --> 07:38:02.039]  A political slaughter by any means.
[07:38:02.980 --> 07:38:08.365]  He waited, he let him throw a couple punches, he stood there triumphantly and then just went after him.
[07:38:08.445 --> 07:38:09.326]  And I just like the way
[07:38:10.086 --> 07:38:17.613]  Even by like 15 minutes in, I put a tweet out that showed Hillary leaning on her little podium that she had next to her.
[07:38:17.633 --> 07:38:18.173]  Hillary Leans.
[07:38:18.513 --> 07:38:19.875]  And she went to her chair every time.
[07:38:20.295 --> 07:38:21.476]  Clearly low energy.
[07:38:22.377 --> 07:38:22.957]  Trump was there.
[07:38:23.017 --> 07:38:25.019]  I think I only saw him lean on his chair one time.
[07:38:25.039 --> 07:38:29.463]  The rest of the time he was kind of walking around looking at who he was going to strike back at.
[07:38:29.483 --> 07:38:30.704]  Would it be the moderators?
[07:38:30.744 --> 07:38:31.465]  Would it be Clinton?
[07:38:31.765 --> 07:38:32.565]  Would it be Obama?
[07:38:33.306 --> 07:38:40.729]  He just, he pulled out all the stops without being, I think, crass and politically, you know, he just really, he laid into her.
[07:38:41.469 --> 07:38:43.490]  And stayed presidential the whole time.
[07:38:43.790 --> 07:38:45.130]  He is sort of like an everyman.
[07:38:45.250 --> 07:38:51.493]  Even though he is a billionaire, he does have that appeal to him where you can see working class people would, you know, kind of dig hanging out with the guy.
[07:38:51.853 --> 07:38:53.053]  And that's his vernacular.
[07:38:53.073 --> 07:38:58.015]  And I think that's why people didn't run away when they heard those comments that were made on tape 11 years ago.
[07:38:58.055 --> 07:38:58.735]  They're like, you know what?
[07:38:59.056 --> 07:38:59.956]  I've probably said worse.
[07:39:00.276 --> 07:39:00.536]  Yeah.
[07:39:00.636 --> 07:39:05.200]  I think if people really look at themselves, and those that don't are lying are beta males.
[07:39:05.380 --> 07:39:05.600]  Yeah.
[07:39:06.221 --> 07:39:11.164]  Well, don't forget, after you finish watching our live coverage, to go to our YouTube channel.
[07:39:11.184 --> 07:39:14.467]  We got Owen Troyer and Josh Owens out there right now.
[07:39:14.487 --> 07:39:19.310]  They've been out there all day filing reports, and you brought up a good video that Owen had.
[07:39:19.351 --> 07:39:19.791]  Yeah, I was.
[07:39:20.091 --> 07:39:21.872]  I only was able to watch one of them.
[07:39:21.993 --> 07:39:24.614]  I was cutting some up for the Alex Jones Channel.
[07:39:24.655 --> 07:39:27.276]  Some of Alex's highlights from just the live debate.
[07:39:27.296 --> 07:39:31.520]  But he went after Chris Hayes, went to ask him a question about what he thought about Alex Jones.
[07:39:31.540 --> 07:39:44.910]  Because he always has so much to say about Alex Jones when he's reading those teleprompters and when they're telling him exactly what to say and they've got it scripted all so cleverly and they'll sit in their little rooms with Rachel Maddow leering over them like an ostrich, you know, trying to figure out how they can attack
[07:39:45.490 --> 07:39:51.696]  Um, Alex Jones and the rest of anybody out there who doesn't feel like, you know, succumbing to the mainstream media talking points.
[07:39:52.117 --> 07:39:53.038]  Well, he had nothing to say.
[07:39:53.178 --> 07:39:55.400]  You know, oh, it's just how I hope he has a great election.
[07:39:55.420 --> 07:39:58.563]  It was kind of laughed it off and he was taking selfie.
[07:39:58.743 --> 07:40:00.525]  It's a bunch of dudes getting selfies with Chris.
[07:40:00.545 --> 07:40:03.107]  That's what I saw when I was at the DNC the entire time.
[07:40:03.588 --> 07:40:04.028]  Oh my God.
[07:40:04.068 --> 07:40:05.069]  Is that, is that Chris Hayes?
[07:40:05.269 --> 07:40:07.812]  Chris Hayes.
[07:40:07.832 --> 07:40:08.593]  We got tons of calls.
[07:40:08.613 --> 07:40:09.914]  Maybe I can get him to sign my man bun.
[07:40:11.912 --> 07:40:15.775]  Alright, let's go take some more of these callers.
[07:40:15.795 --> 07:40:18.497]  What if he's ever autographed a man bun before?
[07:40:18.797 --> 07:40:19.338]  Bet he has.
[07:40:20.439 --> 07:40:23.301]  Alright, let's go to Stephan in Chicago.
[07:40:26.830 --> 07:40:29.951]  I just want to share, you guys are doing an awesome job.
[07:40:30.051 --> 07:40:32.172]  I watch you guys on a daily basis.
[07:40:32.952 --> 07:40:42.115]  My one comment is when Hillary hit Trump with the tax evasion charges, if it comes up again, I think Trump should hit back.
[07:40:42.755 --> 07:40:56.258]  With how the Clintons stole probably the vast majority of money that they took from the American people to give to the Haitian people, which they never received, and that they should both be prosecuted for that.
[07:40:56.658 --> 07:40:57.038]  Yeah.
[07:40:57.138 --> 07:41:01.459]  It was about 5%, I think, that they gave to the Haitians after they got hundreds of millions of dollars.
[07:41:02.079 --> 07:41:01.459]  5%.
[07:41:02.519 --> 07:41:04.419]  Which is actually better than what Bono did.
[07:41:04.759 --> 07:41:07.340]  When Bono was taking money for his charities, he was giving 1% away.
[07:41:08.080 --> 07:41:11.063]  Well we're actually going to be going to Haiti in a few days.
[07:41:11.123 --> 07:41:28.798]  I'm going to be flying down there with Michael Zimmerman and we're going to be getting to the bottom of that and find out what Haitians actually think about the Clintons and get their input and their thoughts on the Clinton Foundation and how they've screwed them over while also covering the devastation that was left behind from this last hurricane.
[07:41:29.418 --> 07:41:31.340]  So thank you for your call, Stevan.
[07:41:32.001 --> 07:41:35.243]  And let's go to our next caller, Zach in Pittsburgh.
[07:41:36.124 --> 07:41:38.266]  Zach, it's a Berg saying, brother.
[07:41:38.286 --> 07:41:39.266]  How's it going?
[07:41:39.467 --> 07:41:39.947]  How are you?
[07:41:40.227 --> 07:41:40.447]  Good.
[07:41:40.487 --> 07:41:40.808]  How are you?
[07:41:40.868 --> 07:41:42.589]  You know, I'm feeling pretty happy right now.
[07:41:42.609 --> 07:41:45.411]  You know, Donald Trump came out just like I thought he would in that second debate.
[07:41:45.851 --> 07:41:46.572]  He hit her harder.
[07:41:46.832 --> 07:41:47.372]  He came out.
[07:41:47.392 --> 07:41:48.153]  He was confident.
[07:41:48.413 --> 07:41:49.334]  He was energetic.
[07:41:49.754 --> 07:41:50.615]  She was on her heels.
[07:41:50.675 --> 07:41:51.475]  She didn't know what to do.
[07:41:51.515 --> 07:41:52.936]  She kept having to take breaks.
[07:41:52.976 --> 07:41:54.117]  So, I mean, I'm pretty pumped up.
[07:41:55.238 --> 07:42:03.344]  I will say that the majority of the time that Hillary Clinton was sitting down while Trump was up talking, she was smiling or smirking.
[07:42:03.988 --> 07:42:06.149]  And just, you know, staring out in the crowd.
[07:42:06.169 --> 07:42:13.433]  There was one specific time she was staring out into the crowd thinking there was no emotion on her face at all.
[07:42:13.973 --> 07:42:16.855]  She kind of stared blankly out into the crowd.
[07:42:17.575 --> 07:42:22.818]  Myself having epilepsy, it appeared to me that she was having a petite mal seizure.
[07:42:23.359 --> 07:42:26.740]  Just blankly staring out into the crowd for probably 25 seconds.
[07:42:28.157 --> 07:42:29.177]  Yeah, we'll have to analyze this.
[07:42:29.237 --> 07:42:30.418]  About what time in the debate?
[07:42:31.138 --> 07:42:31.559]  Do you remember?
[07:42:31.579 --> 07:42:32.139]  I didn't remember.
[07:42:32.159 --> 07:42:34.740]  No, I don't remember the exact time.
[07:42:34.900 --> 07:42:47.926]  I think Mike Cernovich, who's on Twitter all the time, he tweeted out a video where the cameras, like the mainstream media, actually zoomed in on her face, and she's kind of sitting there, like, just dozing out, like, completely.
[07:42:47.946 --> 07:42:50.807]  So I think we'll have to find that and kind of analyze it and look at it.
[07:42:51.047 --> 07:42:53.429]  It took me a little bit, but I found the fly landing on her face.
[07:42:53.509 --> 07:42:56.131]  Oh, got it on her face, and then it landed on her chest again.
[07:42:56.151 --> 07:42:56.831]  Oh, I know, yeah.
[07:42:56.911 --> 07:42:58.192]  Well, we're putting that one out, too.
[07:42:58.232 --> 07:43:00.494]  We typically know where those things like to travel to.
[07:43:00.514 --> 07:43:03.776]  I tell you, you know, they say flies love pure excrement.
[07:43:04.116 --> 07:43:05.917]  Yeah, and that's what's... Need I say more?
[07:43:05.937 --> 07:43:07.198]  That's all that was coming out of her mouth.
[07:43:07.478 --> 07:43:08.079]  Thanks, Zach.
[07:43:08.119 --> 07:43:09.300]  Hey, Zach, let me ask you this.
[07:43:09.540 --> 07:43:12.462]  Have you ridden in one of those driverless Uber cars that's going around Pittsburgh?
[07:43:13.562 --> 07:43:14.603]  I refuse to.
[07:43:14.623 --> 07:43:17.484]  I would rather walk from one side of the city to the other.
[07:43:18.364 --> 07:43:23.967]  The other thing about Pittsburgh is I live about 20 miles or 20 minutes away from the city.
[07:43:24.447 --> 07:43:30.850]  And when Bernie Sanders was still in the election, still running, I saw an enormous amount of Bernie Sanders signs.
[07:43:31.443 --> 07:43:36.825]  Ever since then, those people have taken down their Bernie Sanders signs and not replaced them with anything.
[07:43:37.345 --> 07:43:44.248]  And Western Pennsylvania, I see more Trump signs in Western Pennsylvania than I do even Hillary Clinton bumper stickers.
[07:43:44.608 --> 07:43:54.752]  I was glad to see Trump come out and call out the DNC, W. Wasserman Scholes, and how they stole that and colluded to steal that from Bernie and push Hillary in there and take that.
[07:43:55.032 --> 07:43:56.213]  Let me tell you this, Zach.
[07:43:56.453 --> 07:44:03.896]  In between the DNC and the RNC, we had a couple days and we took a bus trip from Cleveland to Philadelphia.
[07:44:04.657 --> 07:44:10.620]  I drove a rental car to Pittsburgh and went to see some of my friends because I actually graduated from high school in
[07:44:11.440 --> 07:44:11.820]  We're good.
[07:44:26.605 --> 07:44:29.207]  Everybody that I talked to except for one guy, he wasn't.
[07:44:29.267 --> 07:44:31.449]  He was still voting for Hillary Clinton.
[07:44:31.889 --> 07:44:39.976]  But it's just amazing that you see a working class town like Pittsburgh, even they can't get the wool pulled over their eyes anymore.
[07:44:39.996 --> 07:44:41.337]  They're seeing the truth.
[07:44:41.357 --> 07:44:43.018]  They're seeing what Hillary Clinton really is.
[07:44:43.579 --> 07:44:47.742]  And I don't think Donald Trump is perfect by any stretch of the imagination.
[07:44:47.762 --> 07:44:50.564]  I would rather see President Ron Paul.
[07:44:50.864 --> 07:44:52.786]  But right now, Donald Trump is the one who came out
[07:44:53.206 --> 07:45:02.532]  The last thing I wanted to say is when he mentioned his energy policy and he pointed out West Virginia and Ohio and Pennsylvania, the town that I live in has a steel mill.
[07:45:02.552 --> 07:45:04.253]  I can actually throw a rock from my house
[07:45:22.901 --> 07:45:24.982]  And hit a steel mill that's right along the Allegheny River.
[07:45:25.582 --> 07:45:28.483]  We also have a set of railroad tracks that's not far from my house.
[07:45:28.943 --> 07:45:32.104]  We have seen, I maybe see one coal train a week.
[07:45:32.825 --> 07:45:36.966]  When I was younger as a kid, I would see five or six coal trains in a day.
[07:45:37.246 --> 07:45:37.426]  Yeah.
[07:45:37.546 --> 07:45:42.268]  I've also seen a decrease in the amount of steel that, you know, rolled steel that leaves the mill.
[07:45:42.908 --> 07:45:49.931]  So, the amount of jobs that have been impacted by killing the coal industry, and granted it does affect the atmosphere, however,
[07:45:50.598 --> 07:45:53.019]  We need to worry about getting our people back to work.
[07:45:53.079 --> 07:45:54.559]  We need to worry about our economy.
[07:45:54.579 --> 07:46:01.121]  You know, I understand, yeah, we need to find, you know, more green and safer ways to make the energy to help our country thrive and move forward.
[07:46:01.501 --> 07:46:01.721]  Right.
[07:46:03.021 --> 07:46:04.122]  Let me interrupt you real quick, Zach.
[07:46:04.162 --> 07:46:10.963]  People don't understand that as you progress in these technologies, that the green, the cleaner technologies are going to come forth.
[07:46:11.003 --> 07:46:16.565]  But when you start trying to kill these things prematurely and try to institute, you know, windmills or something,
[07:46:17.205 --> 07:46:18.707]  Or giant solar farms?
[07:46:19.067 --> 07:46:22.650]  No, solar and wind are really good, but they're good on a per-house basis.
[07:46:23.071 --> 07:46:34.381]  They're not good in giant wind farms where they have to ship the wind over, they have to ship the energy that the windmills make, you know, hundreds of miles, or they have to build a power plant for when the windmills aren't working.
[07:46:34.641 --> 07:46:41.508]  Those things don't really work at their present state to supply our energy needs the way they currently are.
[07:46:42.168 --> 07:46:44.850]  And when you have cheap energy, you have more innovation.
[07:46:45.291 --> 07:46:47.032]  So I totally agree with you on that.
[07:46:47.132 --> 07:46:48.093]  And it is sad to see.
[07:46:48.713 --> 07:46:50.495]  Pittsburgh used to be a really great place.
[07:46:50.555 --> 07:46:56.139]  It's definitely changed its mark on what it's, you know, and it's having a revitalization now.
[07:46:56.660 --> 07:47:01.784]  But when you have all these jobs that go away, now we're trying to get these jobs back.
[07:47:02.384 --> 07:47:06.747]  And unfortunately, a lot of these jobs are going to be replaced by robots and automation.
[07:47:07.107 --> 07:47:09.769]  So people need to start looking and thinking for themselves.
[07:47:10.169 --> 07:47:10.850]  What can I do?
[07:47:10.910 --> 07:47:15.153]  What skills do I have to make to work out in this new economy?
[07:47:15.213 --> 07:47:23.678]  Because it is it is dog eat dog out there, especially when you look at robots coming in and taking over these, you know, especially these minimum wage jobs that people are clamoring for.
[07:47:23.738 --> 07:47:24.839]  Fifteen dollars an hour.
[07:47:25.119 --> 07:47:26.540]  Wait till a robot takes your job.
[07:47:26.840 --> 07:47:28.782]  Then you're going to be wondering, man, what did I do?
[07:47:29.302 --> 07:47:31.203]  Why did I have why did I go to college and put myself in debt?
[07:47:31.223 --> 07:47:32.164]  But go ahead and continue, Zach.
[07:47:32.924 --> 07:47:34.766]  Yeah, you bring up minimum wage jobs.
[07:47:34.866 --> 07:47:58.083]  The big thing that people don't realize when they say that, you know, the top 1% need the jobs cut, and the top 10% need their wages cut, or they need higher taxes, and the top 10% need to pay more taxes, what you need to realize is the people at the top, yes, they could pay more taxes, but those are also the people that own the companies that provide the jobs to the minimum wage people, to the middle class.
[07:47:58.641 --> 07:48:13.807]  If you cut taxes far enough on the people that control and own the companies that supply people with jobs, they're either going to go to all robots, or they're going to go to automated systems, and it completely eliminates the job that's needed.
[07:48:14.287 --> 07:48:15.368]  For instance, McDonald's.
[07:48:15.788 --> 07:48:23.171]  If they were to take all of their people that work the registers completely out and put in just a kiosk,
[07:48:23.740 --> 07:48:24.040]  Thank you.
[07:48:53.982 --> 07:48:57.064]  Spawns a multi-million dollar company, right?
[07:48:57.224 --> 07:49:08.111]  The people like my you know, people like myself from in college getting a bachelor's degree in IT, you know the chances of me, you know next year immediately hiring a thousand people are quite slim.
[07:49:08.837 --> 07:49:15.760]  So, you know, I understand, you know, Trump's tax plan I think is going to do more for our economy than Hillary could even imagine.
[07:49:15.800 --> 07:49:17.680]  Yeah, but at least you're not going for a liberal arts degree.
[07:49:17.700 --> 07:49:21.362]  You're going for something that could actually be turned into a useful skill.
[07:49:21.722 --> 07:49:22.322]  And I agree with you.
[07:49:22.362 --> 07:49:23.483]  Trump's tax plan is
[07:49:24.583 --> 07:49:24.984]  On fire.
[07:49:25.024 --> 07:49:25.744]  And people don't realize.
[07:49:25.764 --> 07:49:27.866]  They go, it's going to cost all this money in taxes.
[07:49:28.466 --> 07:49:29.147]  No, it's not.
[07:49:29.167 --> 07:49:34.431]  Because you're going to have more people paying taxes because people are going to hire more people when they're paying less taxes.
[07:49:34.451 --> 07:49:39.155]  When giant companies and corporations are paying less taxes, they will hire more people.
[07:49:39.435 --> 07:49:41.537]  And those people will pay income tax.
[07:49:41.957 --> 07:49:47.119]  But we're all going to pay a little bit less, and you know, we really got to look at what our government is spending its money on.
[07:49:47.339 --> 07:49:48.660]  We really got to take them to task.
[07:49:48.720 --> 07:49:55.823]  And that's what I expect Trump to do, just like he said he's going to put a task force together to investigate Hillary Clinton and what she's done with her email server.
[07:49:55.883 --> 07:49:56.623]  And clean house.
[07:49:56.823 --> 07:49:57.043]  Exactly.
[07:49:57.083 --> 07:49:58.184]  Well, thanks for your call, Zach.
[07:49:58.224 --> 07:50:01.525]  Let's go to Michael in Georgia.
[07:50:01.925 --> 07:50:03.646]  Michael, you've been waiting for quite some time.
[07:50:03.666 --> 07:50:05.486]  What are your thoughts on tonight's debate?
[07:50:07.027 --> 07:50:07.367]  Hello?
[07:50:07.807 --> 07:50:08.308]  Hey there, Michael.
[07:50:08.328 --> 07:50:08.888]  You're live.
[07:50:09.815 --> 07:50:10.215]  Right on.
[07:50:10.836 --> 07:50:17.261]  I first wanted to say thank you so much for what y'all are doing and I hope you can hear me.
[07:50:17.301 --> 07:50:17.981]  I can't hear you.
[07:50:18.041 --> 07:50:19.262]  Yeah, we can hear you.
[07:50:19.963 --> 07:50:20.203]  Great.
[07:50:20.723 --> 07:50:26.127]  And I'm going to move on from there and say a couple of things.
[07:50:26.327 --> 07:50:30.630]  Number one, I think we're all high on the fact that
[07:50:31.880 --> 07:50:34.963]  Trump just killed Hillary tonight.
[07:50:35.324 --> 07:50:38.807]  I mean, destroyed her in every shape, form, and fashion.
[07:50:39.127 --> 07:50:43.191]  It was like a different Trump, okay?
[07:50:44.152 --> 07:50:45.634]  In every shape, form, and fashion.
[07:50:45.934 --> 07:50:53.922]  Y'all have talked about that, and I agree, and I watched the debate on infant wars.
[07:50:55.678 --> 07:50:58.860]  Instead of something like Fox or something else like that.
[07:50:59.340 --> 07:51:01.161]  And I thought that was beautiful.
[07:51:01.761 --> 07:51:15.548]  And I think that after the debate, y'all have had just, you know, a wonderful sort of summary of what has transpired from Hillary's behind.
[07:51:16.128 --> 07:51:19.790]  But this is the point that I want to talk about.
[07:51:20.090 --> 07:51:21.491]  And that is, what's next?
[07:51:26.167 --> 07:51:41.157]  Infowars Alex Jones Day is the next point that needs to be talked about regarding the final round of debates between Trump and Hillary.
[07:51:41.177 --> 07:51:47.621]  Do you have any... Well, think about the way things work.
[07:51:47.681 --> 07:51:54.266]  Look at how the first debate, Trump was a little bit more presidential, a little bit more low-key, and he got by.
[07:51:55.182 --> 07:51:58.163]  But then he came back on the second debate and did a lot better.
[07:51:58.263 --> 07:51:59.424]  And he's showing progression.
[07:51:59.824 --> 07:52:03.146]  Now a lot of people can say 50-50 whether Trump or Hillary won the first debate.
[07:52:03.506 --> 07:52:05.947]  But what we saw tonight is she's declining.
[07:52:06.327 --> 07:52:09.408]  So she's showing a rapid decline now.
[07:52:09.748 --> 07:52:12.089]  And her third, she's going to be fighting for her life.
[07:52:12.149 --> 07:52:13.890]  She took three days off before this debate.
[07:52:14.390 --> 07:52:14.490]  Yeah.
[07:52:14.511 --> 07:52:15.611]  And she still couldn't do it.
[07:52:15.991 --> 07:52:17.512]  But Trump progressed.
[07:52:17.672 --> 07:52:19.873]  And that's what it's like in Special Forces training.
[07:52:19.913 --> 07:52:22.074]  I've got buddies who went through all this training.
[07:52:22.114 --> 07:52:24.495]  What happens in that, you go through three PT tests.
[07:52:24.855 --> 07:52:42.990]  Now your first PT test is going to be the easiest one because while you're not tired, you haven't been ruck marching, you know, there's no sore muscles or anything like that, and if you go in and do all you can and, you know, and go balls to the wall and get the highest PT score ever, what's going to happen the next one when you're getting your butt kicked out there in the gutter, out in the trenches?
[07:52:43.711 --> 07:52:44.372]  You're going to go down.
[07:52:44.992 --> 07:52:46.774]  So people always want to see a progression.
[07:52:47.094 --> 07:52:49.877]  So Trump coming out like he did, you know, mediocre.
[07:52:50.317 --> 07:52:51.878]  The second one coming out hardcore.
[07:52:51.918 --> 07:52:54.060]  The third one's going to be the one that everyone's going to remember.
[07:52:54.401 --> 07:53:00.026]  And he's got enough things left on the table that he can talk about and hit her hard on because there's a lot of things I felt like he held back on.
[07:53:00.046 --> 07:53:01.507]  He really didn't bring up the foundation that much.
[07:53:01.547 --> 07:53:01.807]  I don't know.
[07:53:23.234 --> 07:53:23.954]  I mean, look at this.
[07:53:24.155 --> 07:53:25.235]  Trump's going to be in Vegas.
[07:53:25.355 --> 07:53:26.256]  That's his second home.
[07:53:26.516 --> 07:53:27.197]  Yeah.
[07:53:27.297 --> 07:53:29.979]  He's going to have that crowd for him there.
[07:53:30.339 --> 07:53:32.040]  You know, tonight, you know, in St.
[07:53:32.100 --> 07:53:36.343]  Louis, it's clearly geared against Trump being in that kind of an area and that environment.
[07:53:36.363 --> 07:53:37.344]  It's all against him.
[07:53:37.664 --> 07:53:44.409]  But he's going to get to finish the last debate, which is going to be the most memorable one, because no one remembers the first or second debate.
[07:53:44.449 --> 07:53:46.230]  Well, people might actually remember this second debate.
[07:53:46.570 --> 07:53:56.655]  But everyone's going to remember that third debate because that's the last thing that's going to stick in people's minds before they go out of those voting booths on November 8th and really decide the next step for America and which way we're going to go.
[07:53:56.675 --> 07:54:04.779]  I think he started strong, he ended strong, he looked presidential the whole way, she looked very tired and like she was fighting for her life.
[07:54:04.979 --> 07:54:05.119]  Yeah.
[07:54:05.919 --> 07:54:08.960]  I think she's not doing that great.
[07:54:09.820 --> 07:54:11.841]  This next one, you're going to see her be desperate.
[07:54:12.421 --> 07:54:14.002]  I think she's going to come out and hit some things.
[07:54:14.022 --> 07:54:15.042]  They're going to be really catty.
[07:54:15.942 --> 07:54:20.784]  You know, just kind of nitpicking, clawing, trying to do what she can to try to gain any kind of momentum.
[07:54:20.824 --> 07:54:21.724]  But it's just not going to work.
[07:54:21.764 --> 07:54:25.365]  He's going to come in there into Vegas and really hit her hard on everything.
[07:54:25.405 --> 07:54:27.046]  And it's just going to be boom.
[07:54:28.386 --> 07:54:28.966]  What are your thoughts, Mike?
[07:54:29.046 --> 07:54:30.607]  I agree.
[07:54:32.226 --> 07:54:33.508]  It's not perfection.
[07:54:34.168 --> 07:54:36.770]  It's performance and moving forward.
[07:54:39.153 --> 07:54:40.073]  Exactly, exactly.
[07:54:40.294 --> 07:54:41.354]  Well, thanks for your call, Michael.
[07:54:41.415 --> 07:54:42.736]  It has been awesome talking to you.
[07:54:42.776 --> 07:54:46.499]  Thanks for being a listener and supporter here at InfoWars.com.
[07:54:46.559 --> 07:54:48.461]  Let's remind people how they can support us, too.
[07:54:48.481 --> 07:54:50.422]  While we're doing this, we're about to hit midnight.
[07:54:50.603 --> 07:54:51.183]  It's 1154.
[07:54:51.764 --> 07:54:53.025]  We've been going since 4 o'clock.
[07:54:54.104 --> 07:54:56.586]  We got a crew back in there that's been here since three?
[07:54:56.606 --> 07:54:57.407]  Yeah, three.
[07:54:57.467 --> 07:54:58.448]  Working their butts off.
[07:54:59.589 --> 07:55:07.136]  One way you can support us so we can get, we need another crew and a few more reporters, a few more editors, go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[07:55:07.576 --> 07:55:10.539]  Check out some of the great products we have, the InfoWars Life products.
[07:55:10.579 --> 07:55:13.081]  Right now we're running 23% off DNA Force.
[07:55:13.101 --> 07:55:14.663]  Let me tell you a little story about DNA Force.
[07:55:15.023 --> 07:55:17.524]  And I'm not sure if it's the DNA force or the acu-care.
[07:55:18.064 --> 07:55:20.205]  I was getting this twitch in my left eye right here.
[07:55:21.485 --> 07:55:25.447]  It wasn't bad at first, and then a few days later, it was getting worse.
[07:55:25.947 --> 07:55:28.828]  And then it got to where it was happening almost every day.
[07:55:29.108 --> 07:55:35.090]  And I'd kind of stopped doing my, I call them my Yoda juice shakes, where I was putting them, I'd kind of stopped doing that with all the travel and stuff.
[07:55:35.110 --> 07:55:36.090]  I just hadn't got into it.
[07:55:36.830 --> 07:55:39.171]  And I started taking DNA force and acupower.
[07:55:39.891 --> 07:55:44.293]  And within four days, the twitch right here in this eye, it was happening right here, stopped.
[07:55:44.913 --> 07:55:46.494]  And I'm not sure what it is or what it was causing.
[07:55:46.534 --> 07:55:52.197]  I'm sure plenty of people out there are gonna call in and tell me what it was and all the things that I have to do to fix it.
[07:55:52.557 --> 07:55:58.881]  But I tell you what, DNA Force and Occupower were the two things that I started taking religiously, and they stopped it.
[07:55:59.201 --> 07:55:59.321]  So...
[07:56:00.321 --> 07:56:02.944]  Alex actually called Occupy the Poor Man's DNA Force.
[07:56:03.004 --> 07:56:06.948]  It's got one ingredient in there that's not like the rest, but DNA Force is really amazing.
[07:56:07.468 --> 07:56:12.233]  It's got, it's chalked full of things in there for your nerves.
[07:56:12.293 --> 07:56:17.137]  So, you know, if you're having nerve issues, you may want to give it a try.
[07:56:17.237 --> 07:56:18.699]  Brain Force works amazingly.
[07:56:18.839 --> 07:56:21.221]  Yeah, well, yeah, I'm not going to deny Brain Force.
[07:56:21.301 --> 07:56:22.583]  Oxy Powder, awesome.
[07:56:23.254 --> 07:56:24.575]  There you go.
[07:56:24.595 --> 07:56:25.276]  N4store.com.
[07:56:25.796 --> 07:56:43.910]  And don't forget go out and get your Bill Clinton rape t-shirt because we also have a contest going on where if you wear the Bill Clinton rape t-shirt for five seconds on national TV and we can get clear audio of you saying Bill Clinton is a rapist and then you throw in some N4s.com out there
[07:56:44.590 --> 07:56:45.390]  That's $5,000.
[07:56:45.831 --> 07:56:49.932]  Now if you just get the shirt on TV for about five seconds, that's $2,000.
[07:56:50.652 --> 07:56:54.514]  So go to the store right now and pick up your Bill Clinton rate shirt.
[07:56:54.734 --> 07:56:59.135]  I know there's a lot of women that I saw some tweets about today who were up in St.
[07:56:59.255 --> 07:57:02.896]  Louis marching with bullhorns wearing these t-shirts.
[07:57:03.277 --> 07:57:06.838]  Probably like 20 or 30 women marching around with those shirts on, which is pretty cool.
[07:57:06.898 --> 07:57:09.219]  Let me tell you, for an investment of $20 and you could win $5,000.
[07:57:09.519 --> 07:57:11.119]  That's not a bad deal.
[07:57:11.439 --> 07:57:12.760]  That's a big return on investment.
[07:57:13.200 --> 07:57:16.401]  And it's not that hard to get the opportunity.
[07:57:17.142 --> 07:57:18.462]  Everybody out there is doing it.
[07:57:18.482 --> 07:57:22.824]  I've been on every news channel there is just because I go out there and troll them behind it.
[07:57:23.144 --> 07:57:26.466]  If you go to the RNC's, the DNC's, the Trump events, the Clinton events.
[07:57:26.506 --> 07:57:28.387]  They're looking to talk to people.
[07:57:28.407 --> 07:57:35.510]  Go over there, go wear a pro-Clinton t-shirt on and sneak your way over there and just rip it off.
[07:57:36.070 --> 07:57:38.851]  Just put like a little cut in it and just rip it off and have the rape right there.
[07:57:41.400 --> 07:57:47.602]  It really is becoming meme magic at this point, and it's thanks to you out there for getting out there and don't tread on memes.
[07:57:47.742 --> 07:57:58.746]  And then we also have the Hillary for Prison t-shirt, which is an awesome way to spark a conversation and get people out there involved in what is going on.
[07:57:58.766 --> 07:58:03.948]  A lot of people out there don't know why Hillary should go to prison, and you should be the person to tell them why she should.
[07:58:04.548 --> 07:58:06.849]  All right, let's go ahead and move on to our next caller.
[07:58:07.269 --> 07:58:09.730]  That is Angel in New Jersey.
[07:58:09.970 --> 07:58:14.292]  Angel, welcome to the InfoWars live coverage of the second presidential debate.
[07:58:16.212 --> 07:58:17.133]  Good morning.
[07:58:17.273 --> 07:58:17.953]  It's 1 a.m.
[07:58:17.973 --> 07:58:18.713]  in the morning right here.
[07:58:20.454 --> 07:58:22.115]  It has been an awesome night.
[07:58:23.975 --> 07:58:24.716]  Oh, my God.
[07:58:25.176 --> 07:58:26.916]  And now I'm talking to you guys to make it even better.
[07:58:27.657 --> 07:58:29.797]  There's one thing that they didn't really talk about.
[07:58:29.817 --> 07:58:31.018]  Well, they did, but not really.
[07:58:31.938 --> 07:58:33.959]  They didn't really say anything much about Hispanics.
[07:58:34.389 --> 07:58:36.570]  And tell me why that is.
[07:59:00.445 --> 07:59:08.971]  Like, we come here because, I mean, there's only one thing we want, and it's just, we want freedom of speech, which she has taken away from the country.
[07:59:09.212 --> 07:59:09.412]  Yeah.
[07:59:09.812 --> 07:59:12.354]  We're not going to allow that whole thing again to happen.
[07:59:13.535 --> 07:59:15.036]  I love the First Amendment.
[07:59:15.116 --> 07:59:16.237]  I love the Second Amendment.
[07:59:17.558 --> 07:59:19.760]  Unfortunately, I'm not a citizen yet.
[07:59:20.541 --> 07:59:26.786]  I'm a legal permanent resident, and I applied for the citizenship.
[07:59:27.837 --> 07:59:30.718]  In April and they still haven't given me a date for the interview.
[07:59:31.258 --> 07:59:32.859]  I don't know if there's something fishy going on there.
[07:59:33.359 --> 07:59:37.000]  I wonder if they're doing that to Cubans because they know they're going to be pro-Trump.
[07:59:37.700 --> 07:59:40.541]  And they see that because apparently they're rolling people through this.
[07:59:40.641 --> 07:59:44.042]  They're probably monitoring people's social media like, oh, you want to be a citizen?
[07:59:44.122 --> 07:59:45.002]  Oh, you like Trump?
[07:59:45.102 --> 07:59:45.942]  Yeah.
[07:59:45.962 --> 07:59:47.723]  You get put on the six month list.
[07:59:47.763 --> 07:59:49.403]  You come back in six months.
[07:59:50.444 --> 07:59:51.044]  One more thing.
[07:59:51.064 --> 07:59:52.424]  I just don't understand something.
[07:59:53.384 --> 07:59:55.605]  Cubans are mainly concentrated in Miami.
[07:59:56.371 --> 07:59:58.333]  And yet, Florida is blue.
[07:59:59.074 --> 08:00:00.236]  I don't understand that.
[08:00:01.016 --> 08:00:01.357]  I don't.
[08:00:01.457 --> 08:00:02.478]  I don't understand that.
[08:00:03.259 --> 08:00:03.479]  At all.
[08:00:07.401 --> 08:00:10.382]  You know, I don't know the dynamic of Florida, really.
[08:00:10.502 --> 08:00:13.664]  I know it's got a lot of old people that move there.
[08:00:14.484 --> 08:00:18.986]  And, you know, it's the winter birds, or whatever they call them, the spring birds.
[08:00:19.266 --> 08:00:19.566]  I don't know.
[08:00:19.726 --> 08:00:29.571]  But the big cities is where they've turned these big cities that are in Florida into these Democratic playgrounds.
[08:00:29.931 --> 08:00:31.592]  But you look, I was in Orlando.
[08:00:32.392 --> 08:00:40.055]  During, when was it, the second running of George Bush, and I actually went out and campaigned against George Bush because I thought he was a warmonger.
[08:00:40.595 --> 08:00:50.460]  But I was, when I was talking to people, I was actually working with the Democratic Party, but I was saying, vote for Ron Paul, vote for Libertarian, I think it was Libertarian, it wasn't even Ron Paul, it was a Libertarian candidate.
[08:00:50.480 --> 08:00:52.040]  I was saying, go for the Libertarian candidate.
[08:00:52.400 --> 08:00:57.182]  We got to put, we got to set a message that we need a third party in this country.
[08:00:57.522 --> 08:00:58.243]  And I really do think
[08:00:58.843 --> 08:01:04.086]  We are getting kind of screwed by having to choose between two people, although right now I'd totally choose Trump over Hillary Clinton.
[08:01:05.347 --> 08:01:12.070]  But not having a third choice out there, even a fourth choice, I think they should let these other two clowns into the debates.
[08:01:12.130 --> 08:01:15.272]  Jill Stein wants to give everything away, let's expose that.
[08:01:15.652 --> 08:01:23.417]  Gary Johnson doesn't really know anything, although he does have some credibility as being, you know, the former governor of New Mexico.
[08:01:23.857 --> 08:01:24.597]  I don't think so.
[08:01:47.671 --> 08:01:48.891]  Let's talk about all the issues.
[08:01:49.111 --> 08:01:50.632]  But right now, I'm all in for Trump.
[08:01:50.932 --> 08:01:55.273]  And I thought tonight he really exposed, you know, the monster that Hillary Clinton is.
[08:01:55.573 --> 08:01:56.073]  And I loved it.
[08:01:56.133 --> 08:01:59.794]  After everything he would say, she would get up and say, folks, this is simply not true.
[08:01:59.834 --> 08:02:00.934]  That's all she had to go on.
[08:02:01.674 --> 08:02:04.255]  And the crowd's like, boo, like, come on.
[08:02:04.515 --> 08:02:06.895]  They really laughed when he said, because you'd be in prison.
[08:02:07.095 --> 08:02:07.596]  Exactly.
[08:02:07.636 --> 08:02:09.876]  When she said, if you were president, things would be different.
[08:02:09.896 --> 08:02:11.216]  He's like, because you'd be in prison.
[08:02:11.597 --> 08:02:12.817]  And the crowd erupted.
[08:02:12.837 --> 08:02:13.637]  So I thought that was great.
[08:02:13.677 --> 08:02:15.578]  Well Angel, thank you for the call.
[08:02:15.618 --> 08:02:18.499]  Thanks for being a listener and supporter of the InfoWar.
[08:02:18.839 --> 08:02:20.039]  We appreciate it very much.
[08:02:20.059 --> 08:02:22.000]  Now we're going to move on to Keith in New York.
[08:02:22.500 --> 08:02:26.241]  Keith wants to talk about Trump attacking Hillary Clinton.
[08:02:26.281 --> 08:02:26.821]  Take it away.
[08:02:26.841 --> 08:02:34.824]  Hey Keith, are you on speakerphone?
[08:02:34.844 --> 08:02:35.544]  We can barely hear you.
[08:02:36.544 --> 08:02:37.084]  Yes, I am.
[08:02:37.585 --> 08:02:38.885]  Oh yeah, take it off speaker.
[08:02:38.905 --> 08:02:41.106]  Hold on a second.
[08:02:41.626 --> 08:02:41.806]  Okay.
[08:02:43.439 --> 08:02:44.359]  All right, I got you.
[08:02:44.519 --> 08:02:44.939]  There you go.
[08:02:44.959 --> 08:02:45.579]  All right, there we go.
[08:02:45.619 --> 08:02:46.140]  Now we can hear you.
[08:02:46.160 --> 08:02:47.020]  Now go ahead and make your point.
[08:02:48.860 --> 08:02:49.980]  So there's a couple of things.
[08:02:51.101 --> 08:02:54.221]  This is Keith from CelebrateHealth.us, Special Forces Marine.
[08:02:55.782 --> 08:02:59.102]  And everything that we did always required accountability.
[08:02:59.122 --> 08:03:03.663]  Every round, you know, you have to be responsible for your ammunition, for your equipment.
[08:03:04.143 --> 08:03:11.125]  When you engage in something, when you don't engage in it, there's always some type of form that makes you provide accountability.
[08:03:12.465 --> 08:03:19.169]  For some godforsaken reason, one of these candidates just has no accountability whatsoever.
[08:03:19.189 --> 08:03:23.712]  And that's just atrocious.
[08:03:25.153 --> 08:03:33.778]  So, she's had more bodies associated in her close circle that are dead now than I had in my units.
[08:03:34.118 --> 08:03:36.780]  And she hasn't been through combat situations.
[08:03:37.620 --> 08:03:38.421]  That's a pretty scary one.
[08:03:39.261 --> 08:03:40.682]  That requires accountability.
[08:03:41.943 --> 08:03:48.648]  Somebody needs to make some type of inquiry as to explaining a couple of those bodies.
[08:03:49.228 --> 08:03:50.589]  Yeah.
[08:03:51.229 --> 08:03:59.195]  You raised 13 billion dollars for Haiti with your foundation and I'm quite close with government from Haiti.
[08:03:59.975 --> 08:04:02.997]  They've received about one to two percent of it.
[08:04:03.338 --> 08:04:03.998]  Where's the money?
[08:04:05.179 --> 08:04:06.600]  Where's the accountability for that?
[08:04:07.836 --> 08:04:15.278]  You get a couple of hundred requests for help in the Benghazi Embassy that are ignored and it results in death.
[08:04:15.998 --> 08:04:18.359]  That requires accountability.
[08:04:20.320 --> 08:04:27.962]  If you simply just go over some of the money that's been injected into that foundation... Where it comes from, yeah.
[08:04:28.022 --> 08:04:34.624]  Just take 10 of them and just tie in some of the benefits that were reciprocated for that.
[08:04:35.436 --> 08:04:39.399]  You're gonna get a pattern across the board with hundreds of donations into that foundation.
[08:04:40.379 --> 08:04:41.900]  That requires accountability.
[08:04:42.841 --> 08:04:46.383]  And this list, it just goes on and on and on and on and on.
[08:04:46.403 --> 08:05:00.252]  You know, if you take, uh, what the New York Times just put on their front page with his, his, um, you know, his audio of the Locker Room Chat, you're looking at a couple of misdemeanors.
[08:05:02.498 --> 08:05:05.400]  Well, and he didn't even admit anything.
[08:05:05.440 --> 08:05:06.781]  He was just talking crude.
[08:05:06.801 --> 08:05:09.683]  I mean, he didn't say, I did this to this person.
[08:05:10.003 --> 08:05:14.887]  You know, he said, I tried to get on this one host who was married and took her out of furniture shop.
[08:05:15.167 --> 08:05:18.650]  And also when he failed, he stopped.
[08:05:18.890 --> 08:05:19.390]  Yeah, he stopped.
[08:05:19.430 --> 08:05:21.492]  He goes, I tried, I failed.
[08:05:21.652 --> 08:05:23.093]  He didn't say, I tried, I failed.
[08:05:23.113 --> 08:05:25.675]  So then I tied her up in the woodshed and raped her for three days.
[08:05:25.935 --> 08:05:26.576]  You know, he didn't.
[08:05:27.156 --> 08:05:27.696]  He stopped.
[08:05:27.817 --> 08:05:30.879]  He was, you know, and he's sitting there chatting with this little bush.
[08:05:31.059 --> 08:05:35.782]  That's what makes it so obvious that it's a bush that is on the other end of that.
[08:05:35.842 --> 08:05:38.464]  I wonder how long they've just been holding on to that.
[08:05:38.484 --> 08:05:41.487]  Just waiting that right precise time to finally unleash it.
[08:05:41.787 --> 08:05:42.007]  Yeah.
[08:05:42.407 --> 08:05:43.708]  Hey Keith, real quick question.
[08:05:44.008 --> 08:05:50.593]  In your unit, your group of guys, I don't know if you're retired or not, but how many of your guys out there are for Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton?
[08:05:51.934 --> 08:05:54.536]  I can't count on one hand versus a four of us.
[08:05:56.528 --> 08:06:08.765]  So, we all realize that after our deployment, let's say in one of our deployments, you had the former Secretary of State, I think you know who it is, he's the former CEO of Hollyburton,
[08:06:09.528 --> 08:06:13.269]  He got about 40% of the contracts to rebuild what we just destroyed.
[08:06:13.289 --> 08:06:14.209]  Right.
[08:06:14.349 --> 08:06:15.550]  That's not by accident.
[08:06:15.770 --> 08:06:15.950]  No.
[08:06:16.150 --> 08:06:19.391]  And once you realize that, you think you're out there fighting for your country.
[08:06:19.411 --> 08:06:20.771]  I got shrapnel in my chest.
[08:06:21.331 --> 08:06:22.452]  I gotta look at it every day.
[08:06:22.472 --> 08:06:30.034]  And I realize that many of the guys in my unit realize that what we've done wasn't what we were told we were there for.
[08:06:30.054 --> 08:06:34.095]  And once you realize you've been duped, you want some accountability.
[08:06:36.940 --> 08:06:43.102]  It starts with the military-industrial complex, and that's a big, that's even bigger than this presidency that's going on right now.
[08:06:43.122 --> 08:06:46.723]  The way that is, go ahead, go ahead.
[08:06:46.983 --> 08:06:50.744]  The whole last 24 years of those fuckers require accountability.
[08:06:50.804 --> 08:06:52.764]  Yeah, I agree.
[08:06:53.045 --> 08:07:02.047]  Everyone that's been in the office, everyone that's benefited from it, all of the bankers, etc., they all require that probe, that same probe.
[08:07:03.015 --> 08:07:06.318]  And if they're dead by now, their families should be held accountable.
[08:07:06.398 --> 08:07:13.965]  Somehow, someway, if you can bring justice over the past couple of presidents and administrations, you won't only unite America.
[08:07:14.206 --> 08:07:16.287]  I think you'll unite the entire world.
[08:07:16.848 --> 08:07:18.309]  People just want to see justice.
[08:07:18.329 --> 08:07:20.852]  And once you have justice, you can have peace.
[08:07:23.630 --> 08:07:23.990]  Amen.
[08:07:24.490 --> 08:07:25.071]  Amen there.
[08:07:25.451 --> 08:07:25.872]  I agree.
[08:07:25.992 --> 08:07:35.901]  I think that is one of the biggest, where people say war is the health of the state, and they say we have to be at war so we can make bombs, so we can keep these systems going, so we can bomb people.
[08:07:36.642 --> 08:07:38.904]  We created the enemies that we're fighting now.
[08:07:38.984 --> 08:07:40.946]  That, I don't know, can you argue with that?
[08:07:41.026 --> 08:07:41.847]  I can't argue with that.
[08:07:41.887 --> 08:07:42.828]  That's bonafide.
[08:07:43.683 --> 08:07:53.705]  The reason we have all these enemies out in the Middle East is because we went and tried to tell them how to run their business, and we propped up evil dictatorships, and we overthrew the ones we didn't like, the ones in the 50s.
[08:07:53.825 --> 08:08:00.106]  It goes back to the 50s with the Shah of Iran when we overthrew him with the CIA, and we figured out, hey, we can do this.
[08:08:00.186 --> 08:08:02.287]  We can overthrow governments, put in the people we want.
[08:08:02.327 --> 08:08:02.647]  Coups.
[08:08:03.047 --> 08:08:03.587]  Exactly.
[08:08:04.067 --> 08:08:07.288]  And you know, when Qaddafi got in, we were kind of for Qaddafi.
[08:08:07.888 --> 08:08:09.109]  We're for Saddam Hussein.
[08:08:09.369 --> 08:08:10.490]  He was one of our guys.
[08:08:10.870 --> 08:08:13.411]  And then when he becomes expendable, that's what people don't understand.
[08:08:13.451 --> 08:08:18.274]  When you play with this devil that is the military-industrial complex, this is not the United States.
[08:08:18.294 --> 08:08:20.455]  This is not the people who even fought in these wars.
[08:08:20.735 --> 08:08:24.477]  This is the people that are pulling the strings to make these things happen, to make these wars happen.
[08:08:24.737 --> 08:08:30.341]  Because let me tell you, it's not anybody that's going out there fighting and spilling their blood that is responsible for
[08:08:31.241 --> 08:08:35.806]  The multi-decade misery that you could say our country has caused.
[08:08:35.886 --> 08:08:37.527]  And I don't think it's in the name of our country.
[08:08:37.567 --> 08:08:43.693]  It's the name of these bankers and these corrupt politicians and everyone who serves them that needs to be held accountable.
[08:08:43.713 --> 08:08:44.694]  I totally agree with you, Keith.
[08:08:44.774 --> 08:08:45.415]  We need that.
[08:08:45.915 --> 08:08:47.036]  I don't know if Trump's going to do that.
[08:08:47.737 --> 08:08:50.739]  But I'd say Trump is a good start to start delving into that.
[08:08:51.419 --> 08:08:55.041]  Man, if we could put the Clintons in prison, they could spend the rest of their lives in prison.
[08:08:55.462 --> 08:08:56.122]  That sets a tone.
[08:08:56.182 --> 08:08:56.482]  It does.
[08:08:56.522 --> 08:09:00.025]  It sets a tone to go to the next guy and say, you know what, you're doing stuff too.
[08:09:00.045 --> 08:09:01.065]  We're going to investigate you.
[08:09:01.585 --> 08:09:03.507]  Because they want to turn the eye on us.
[08:09:03.527 --> 08:09:07.529]  Think if that happens though, everyone's going to be scared in that White House.
[08:09:07.589 --> 08:09:09.530]  Everyone out there in the government is going to be so scared.
[08:09:09.550 --> 08:09:10.711]  Like, oh my God, am I going to be next?
[08:09:10.951 --> 08:09:13.673]  And we need to start looking at people in the government and what they're doing.
[08:09:14.413 --> 08:09:18.035]  And who they are beholden to, because they're not beholden to the American people at this point.
[08:09:18.055 --> 08:09:23.879]  We'll see how many people are strong, and with her, if that does happen, you'll see people turning left and right.
[08:09:23.899 --> 08:09:26.980]  It needs to be bipartisan, though.
[08:09:27.000 --> 08:09:29.082]  You need to go after both sides, because both sides are responsible.
[08:09:29.182 --> 08:09:29.422]  Oh, yeah.
[08:09:29.542 --> 08:09:36.526]  You can't just say, you know, you got these people like Paul Ryan and Scott Walker and these guys that are fake, you know, fake conservatives that just want to just, you know,
[08:09:37.774 --> 08:09:42.437]  Give lip service to people that aren't really into any one ideology except for themselves.
[08:09:42.757 --> 08:09:46.740]  I mean, personally, if I'm gonna get on Soapbox here, term limits.
[08:09:46.760 --> 08:09:47.540]  You gotta have term limits.
[08:09:47.680 --> 08:09:48.841]  In the Senate and in the House.
[08:09:48.901 --> 08:09:49.221]  Period.
[08:09:49.482 --> 08:09:52.543]  And I think the President should only serve, I agree with Ventura, one six-year term.
[08:09:53.304 --> 08:09:55.525]  You get one six-year term, there's no re-election circus.
[08:09:55.906 --> 08:09:57.587]  You get in, you do your business, and you're out.
[08:09:57.807 --> 08:09:58.888]  And then we get somebody else in.
[08:09:59.068 --> 08:10:00.288]  And if we don't like that guy, he's out.
[08:10:00.308 --> 08:10:00.909]  It doesn't matter.
[08:10:00.969 --> 08:10:01.949]  He's only got six years.
[08:10:03.501 --> 08:10:04.161]  Thanks for calling, Keith.
[08:10:04.181 --> 08:10:04.862]  That was awesome.
[08:10:04.942 --> 08:10:05.802]  Great call.
[08:10:06.042 --> 08:10:07.642]  Now let's go to William in Georgetown.
[08:10:07.662 --> 08:10:08.903]  You've been on for a while.
[08:10:09.983 --> 08:10:13.104]  You want to talk about the fly on Hillary Clinton's face?
[08:10:13.204 --> 08:10:15.945]  I think that's going to be a huge talking point tomorrow.
[08:10:15.965 --> 08:10:16.545]  It's pretty funny.
[08:10:16.645 --> 08:10:18.346]  What are your thoughts on that?
[08:10:19.306 --> 08:10:19.926]  Hey, Joe.
[08:10:19.966 --> 08:10:21.927]  Hope I see you out at Best of the West sometime.
[08:10:22.367 --> 08:10:22.867]  Yes, sir.
[08:10:23.207 --> 08:10:26.468]  I'll be out there this coming weekend for the Texas Gun Festival.
[08:10:27.328 --> 08:10:28.209]  Oh, good deal, brother.
[08:10:29.983 --> 08:10:33.826]  I wanted to start out with a bit of humor before I had a question for you guys.
[08:10:34.587 --> 08:10:42.914]  The first, when you Google the word fly on, the thing that auto-populates first is fly on Hillary's face.
[08:10:46.257 --> 08:10:57.647]  And then the second humor would be, I'd like to personally commend Hillary Clinton's storytelling, I mean, flying capabilities, hashtag Felix the Ethiopian.
[08:10:59.013 --> 08:11:02.775]  I don't know if you guys caught that in the debate when she started talking about Felix.
[08:11:03.775 --> 08:11:04.956]  Was she talking about the Syrians?
[08:11:04.996 --> 08:11:06.076]  She called him an Ethiopian?
[08:11:07.357 --> 08:11:17.502]  No, remember she said some woman wrote her this letter and her son was really terrified that when Trump becomes president... Oh yeah, I remember that.
[08:11:18.422 --> 08:11:21.023]  Anyway, I was just like, this is storytelling at its finest.
[08:11:23.244 --> 08:11:26.486]  But my question really, it was kind of wanted to touch on
[08:11:27.105 --> 08:11:32.568]  What Mike kind of mentioned in Georgia, which was kind of what's next.
[08:11:32.968 --> 08:11:42.712]  And Joe, you kind of broke it down how what he was going to do in his first or what he did in his first debate, how he came out literally like a lion in this debate.
[08:11:43.953 --> 08:11:52.417]  And I just want to say that I've been one of those kind of quiet Trump supporters and I'm a native Texan.
[08:11:53.800 --> 08:11:57.382]  I know a lot of my best friends here across the U.S.
[08:11:57.682 --> 08:12:05.607]  are the same way, but tonight something has finally kind of lit a fire in me, and I don't know.
[08:12:05.647 --> 08:12:07.529]  I've been watching you guys for a really, really long time.
[08:12:07.589 --> 08:12:12.692]  I've never tried to call in, but yeah, I don't know.
[08:12:13.212 --> 08:12:22.758]  What I want to say or what I want to get y'all's thoughts on is I just feel like it's such a pivotal moment, and I wish, if Trump was to hear this, that he would just know
[08:12:23.937 --> 08:12:31.542]  I hope he can see, I think he knows what's at stake, but just speak to the American people now and show him the man that he is.
[08:12:32.542 --> 08:12:35.164]  And I kind of wanted to know what y'all thoughts were about that.
[08:12:35.204 --> 08:12:36.925]  You know, just speaking to people and saying,
[08:12:40.054 --> 08:12:47.098]  Yes, I believe in treat others how you want to be treated and love other people and everyone's created equal.
[08:12:47.158 --> 08:12:47.838]  Things like that.
[08:12:47.858 --> 08:12:50.880]  He's clearly out there more than anybody else.
[08:12:51.180 --> 08:12:52.341]  Hillary's taking these 3-4 day naps.
[08:12:54.582 --> 08:12:59.583]  You know, getting our injections is, you know, to be able to go and talk for longer than 10 minutes, you know, during these debates.
[08:12:59.623 --> 08:13:00.544]  But think about it.
[08:13:00.604 --> 08:13:11.427]  Day in and day out, Trump is out there in different cities, in different states, out there campaigning, talking to the American people, which thousands upon thousands of people are showing up to listen to this man talk.
[08:13:11.807 --> 08:13:16.668]  I mean, he is out there tirelessly fighting for America like I've never seen someone go out there before.
[08:13:16.688 --> 08:13:18.129]  I mean, he hardly even sleeps.
[08:13:18.529 --> 08:13:23.110]  I mean, the guy's like tweeting until like 2, 3 o'clock in the morning and then 6 o'clock it starts all over again.
[08:13:23.610 --> 08:13:31.372]  I tell you what, by him able to fly his plane around and land at all these, he can do multiple events in multiple states and one day he does it.
[08:13:32.652 --> 08:13:37.773]  You know, the only person that I saw with that, two other people with that kind of populism were Bernie Sanders and Ron Paul.
[08:13:38.254 --> 08:13:40.934]  There's never been any of these candidates.
[08:13:40.994 --> 08:13:44.015]  I don't care, even Obama had this populism that was manufactured.
[08:13:44.215 --> 08:13:44.475]  Yeah.
[08:13:44.515 --> 08:13:45.816]  He wasn't really a populist.
[08:13:46.177 --> 08:13:47.197]  They manufactured it.
[08:13:47.738 --> 08:13:49.579]  Nobody knew who he was for a long time.
[08:13:50.020 --> 08:13:52.141]  And then when he beat Clinton, it was like, well, we got to get him in.
[08:13:52.502 --> 08:13:58.206]  And it was this manufactured populism that came up where people were saying, you know, he's going to give us free house, free car.
[08:13:58.226 --> 08:13:59.207]  He's going to give us this and that.
[08:13:59.267 --> 08:14:01.189]  Everybody's looking for their free handout.
[08:14:01.609 --> 08:14:05.292]  But with Trump, the people aren't looking for a free handout.
[08:14:05.772 --> 08:14:07.013]  They're not looking for something for free.
[08:14:07.193 --> 08:14:09.815]  They're looking to be able to live their lives and be left alone.
[08:14:09.996 --> 08:14:12.538]  I have gone probably 50 Trump rallies.
[08:14:13.274 --> 08:14:13.994]  Maybe a little less.
[08:14:14.675 --> 08:14:16.195]  But just meeting the people in line.
[08:14:16.215 --> 08:14:21.717]  When I hear people say Trump supporters are racist, xenophobes say... Man, there's nothing further than the truth.
[08:14:21.837 --> 08:14:24.618]  These people... They just want the ability to go work hard.
[08:14:24.878 --> 08:14:26.659]  They want to work.
[08:14:26.779 --> 08:14:28.399]  And they're usually small business owners, too.
[08:14:28.419 --> 08:14:29.480]  They're not looking for a handout.
[08:14:29.520 --> 08:14:30.060]  Oh, they are.
[08:14:30.340 --> 08:14:31.721]  Most of them are small business owners.
[08:14:32.861 --> 08:14:35.522]  I met a guy who ran a vape shop the last Wisconsin rally.
[08:14:35.942 --> 08:14:42.170]  Talked about how the vape industry is now being regulated where he can't go out and earn, you know, the money that he used to earn because they got all these regulations.
[08:14:42.531 --> 08:14:45.675]  That's just one story of many that you hear out on the road.
[08:14:45.695 --> 08:14:53.165]  These are motivated Americans who are out there trying to earn a living, do it the right way, honestly, and they just want that freedom and that ability to be able to do it.
[08:14:54.494 --> 08:14:54.714]  Exactly.
[08:14:54.754 --> 08:14:56.235]  All right, great call, William.
[08:14:56.315 --> 08:14:57.035]  We appreciate it.
[08:14:57.055 --> 08:14:57.675]  Thanks for listening.
[08:14:57.695 --> 08:14:59.636]  Hey, become a vocal Trump supporter.
[08:14:59.756 --> 08:15:00.316]  Yeah.
[08:15:00.336 --> 08:15:00.876]  Get out there.
[08:15:00.996 --> 08:15:01.516]  It's time.
[08:15:01.616 --> 08:15:02.336]  Third debate.
[08:15:02.537 --> 08:15:05.297]  Maybe get a Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[08:15:05.497 --> 08:15:08.238]  All right, we're going to go to Anita in Colorado.
[08:15:08.258 --> 08:15:12.180]  Anita wants to talk about health care, UN control over guns as well.
[08:15:12.580 --> 08:15:15.681]  Anita, you are live with us here at the InfoWars coverage.
[08:15:17.441 --> 08:15:17.881]  Hey, guys.
[08:15:18.201 --> 08:15:18.582]  How's it going?
[08:15:18.602 --> 08:15:20.182]  Just wanted to get right to the point tonight.
[08:15:20.942 --> 08:15:22.843]  Number one, I'm a naturopath, a biochemist.
[08:15:24.006 --> 08:15:27.508]  And what's going on in the medical industry is a fiasco.
[08:15:27.988 --> 08:15:39.893]  There's millions of extra people in the system and doctors are fleeing the practices they've had for years because they can't afford to stay in there and run people through like a cattle business.
[08:15:41.013 --> 08:15:45.155]  This thing is such a fiasco in the medical industry, people have no idea.
[08:15:46.007 --> 08:15:47.849]  Just make sure Hillary fixes it.
[08:15:47.889 --> 08:15:51.592]  She's going to make it better.
[08:15:51.792 --> 08:15:56.916]  The conductor of the train is on the verge of, you know, smashing into the mountain.
[08:15:57.857 --> 08:16:14.851]  And for those of us who actually take care of our health, they want us to fund everybody else who does not want to work, who wants to come here, whether they get shipped in for free, get given money, and get given a place to live, and now they want to guarantee them jobs.
[08:16:15.327 --> 08:16:17.689]  I'm just like, what else can we go wrong?
[08:16:17.749 --> 08:16:18.770]  I'm getting off on a tangent.
[08:16:18.810 --> 08:16:19.370]  Rabbit trail.
[08:16:19.411 --> 08:16:19.751]  Sorry.
[08:16:20.431 --> 08:16:26.396]  Hillary will take care of the healthcare system like the VA was going to take care of my torn ACL when they told me it was a broken ankle.
[08:16:26.657 --> 08:16:26.917]  Yeah.
[08:16:27.277 --> 08:16:27.497]  Yeah.
[08:16:27.517 --> 08:16:34.984]  Well, I work with, I work with, uh, I work with people who were veterans from Vietnam war with PTSD and all kinds of things like that.
[08:16:35.626 --> 08:16:50.635]  That we put all this money into helping all these people in other places, putting together disastrous health care plans, while we have guys living under bridges and suffering and cannot get the help they need, who sacrificed their lives, and they're starved for the rest of their lives.
[08:16:51.335 --> 08:16:52.756]  This lights me up.
[08:16:53.276 --> 08:16:53.957]  This lights me up.
[08:16:54.017 --> 08:16:55.898]  I see it happening all the time.
[08:16:58.166 --> 08:16:59.867]  We have our head in the sand.
[08:16:59.907 --> 08:17:01.328]  We are buried into our sport.
[08:17:01.828 --> 08:17:06.431]  We are buried into our whatever distraction that we have nationally going on.
[08:17:06.752 --> 08:17:14.657]  This whole thing with Billary and Killary bringing up this crap about Trump and what he did 11 years ago.
[08:17:15.157 --> 08:17:17.638]  What one of us could be lined up anywhere in the world?
[08:17:17.678 --> 08:17:21.981]  Pick up anybody and get a public opinion on everybody in that line.
[08:17:22.562 --> 08:17:24.723]  What one of us couldn't be roasted about something?
[08:17:25.560 --> 08:17:28.221]  But this is a distraction from what's really going on.
[08:17:28.241 --> 08:17:31.021]  Our healthcare system is in a dump.
[08:17:31.761 --> 08:17:34.142]  It's not in a ditch, it's in a dump.
[08:17:34.982 --> 08:17:38.383]  We have Russia pointing missiles at Syria?
[08:17:38.723 --> 08:17:40.303]  You think they don't have them pointed at us?
[08:17:40.743 --> 08:17:41.023]  Really?
[08:17:41.043 --> 08:17:42.904]  I mean, you know?
[08:17:42.924 --> 08:17:45.784]  You think we don't have missiles pointed at them?
[08:17:45.924 --> 08:17:50.025]  The thing with Russia is they're pissed off that we keep moving missiles closer to them.
[08:17:51.193 --> 08:17:54.454]  Because that negates their second strike capabilities.
[08:17:55.054 --> 08:17:56.595]  And that's a serious issue.
[08:17:56.635 --> 08:17:58.715]  We call it a missile shield or missile defense system.
[08:17:59.115 --> 08:18:02.796]  But it's about those missiles can easily, and it's what Putin came out and said.
[08:18:02.816 --> 08:18:06.838]  He said, look, those missiles, they say it's for missile defense, but they could easily become offense.
[08:18:08.518 --> 08:18:11.859]  We're going to go in and negotiate with him just like we're doing with Kim Jong-un.
[08:18:12.279 --> 08:18:13.860]  And like what happened actually in
[08:18:15.563 --> 08:18:16.904]  The Pearl Harbor situation.
[08:18:17.284 --> 08:18:25.691]  The day before Pearl Harbor happened, if you look at your history and really read it, there was just an agreement made.
[08:18:26.332 --> 08:18:27.973]  The day before that thing took place.
[08:18:28.654 --> 08:18:30.996]  That's why agreements always work, right?
[08:18:31.396 --> 08:18:40.984]  We're going to non-negotiate with Putin, but you know, as Donald Trump says so eloquently, he's been in there for decades.
[08:18:48.068 --> 08:18:49.630]  She's got no interest in changing the system.
[08:18:49.670 --> 08:18:50.991]  She wants to keep it status quo.
[08:18:51.331 --> 08:18:53.013]  That's why the big banks are backing her.
[08:18:53.293 --> 08:18:56.436]  That's why all the major media outlets are backing her.
[08:18:56.476 --> 08:19:04.783]  That's why Republicans and Democrats are backing her because they're afraid to see a real change because that's their little golden egg is what Hillary Clinton represents.
[08:19:05.103 --> 08:19:05.803]  Well, thank you, Anita.
[08:19:05.823 --> 08:19:08.564]  We've got to go to our last caller of the night.
[08:19:09.184 --> 08:19:10.045]  Thanks for being on the show.
[08:19:10.105 --> 08:19:12.525]  Thanks for being a listener and supporting us.
[08:19:12.565 --> 08:19:13.706]  We appreciate it very much.
[08:19:13.966 --> 08:19:19.107]  We're going to go to John in Arkansas, our final caller of the night for this debate coverage.
[08:19:19.508 --> 08:19:20.468]  John, take it away.
[08:19:20.488 --> 08:19:22.629]  Hey, Joe, how you doing?
[08:19:22.649 --> 08:19:29.931]  It's been a great night, and I was just really pumped to see our next press for Hillary.
[08:19:30.792 --> 08:19:35.616]  I've got kind of a, I guess, a field report, if you will, from here in Central Arkansas.
[08:19:36.177 --> 08:19:39.179]  I'm the Trump campaign coordinator for Long Island County, Arkansas.
[08:19:39.819 --> 08:19:45.604]  And we had our local community festival Cabot Fest yesterday.
[08:19:46.345 --> 08:19:52.269]  Because of the great weather we had, it was the best turnout I've seen in the 17 years that I've lived here.
[08:19:53.030 --> 08:19:54.111]  And it was just phenomenal.
[08:19:55.432 --> 08:19:58.875]  I took the signs to the Republican booth that we had there.
[08:19:59.574 --> 08:20:04.957]  And I only have 40 of them left at my law office, but they're all on by 11 a.m.
[08:20:06.638 --> 08:20:15.643]  And it being the day after the 11-year-old video of Trump came out, based on the mainstream media, I think that'd be all people were talking about.
[08:20:16.324 --> 08:20:17.725]  Absolutely nobody cared about it.
[08:20:18.225 --> 08:20:19.225]  It was not an issue.
[08:20:19.285 --> 08:20:24.528]  The few times that it came up, it was in the context of what a tempest in a teapot that is.
[08:20:25.089 --> 08:20:27.070]  It's ridiculous that the media is harping on it.
[08:20:27.648 --> 08:20:27.788]  Yeah.
[08:20:47.850 --> 08:20:48.771]  And she covered it up.
[08:20:49.031 --> 08:20:51.913]  She helped put these people, silence these people.
[08:20:51.953 --> 08:20:52.574]  That's the thing.
[08:20:53.254 --> 08:20:56.257]  People don't care about this BS because they know it's BS.
[08:20:56.277 --> 08:20:57.898]  They know it's coming from the mainstream media.
[08:20:58.158 --> 08:21:02.002]  They know the mainstream media is bought and sold by the big bomb makers NBC.
[08:21:02.022 --> 08:21:05.184]  She got a rapist off and then she lived with one for the rest of her life.
[08:21:05.324 --> 08:21:05.865]  Exactly.
[08:21:06.445 --> 08:21:11.228]  So as we leave tonight, I think we ought to just start laughing maniacally because Donald Trump won.
[08:21:11.268 --> 08:21:12.108]  We've won this battle.
[08:21:12.368 --> 08:21:13.729]  Let's hope we win the election.
[08:21:13.749 --> 08:21:14.850]  Get out there and vote November 8th.
[08:21:15.530 --> 08:21:20.112]  And I think it's great to see Donald Trump tear Hillary Clinton a new one because she totally deserves it, if anyone does.
[08:21:20.212 --> 08:21:26.376]  And join us next week for the third and final debate leading up to the November 8th election where
[08:21:27.376 --> 08:21:27.977]  In nine days.
[08:21:28.077 --> 08:21:29.057]  It's the 19th, isn't it?
[08:21:29.578 --> 08:21:30.719]  Yes, I believe so, yes.
[08:21:31.299 --> 08:21:33.981]  So, join us for that live coverage as well.
[08:21:34.001 --> 08:21:40.446]  We'll sit back, we'll listen to the commentary, we'll listen to these two debate, and we will give our coverage later.
[08:21:40.886 --> 08:21:46.510]  So, this is it for the InfoWars Second Debate live coverage here at InfoWars.com with Rob Doo, Joe Big.
[08:21:56.445 --> 08:22:00.732]  Americanism, not globalism will be our credo!
[08:22:03.416 --> 08:22:05.418]  Americanism, not globalism!
[08:22:19.907 --> 08:22:27.012]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
