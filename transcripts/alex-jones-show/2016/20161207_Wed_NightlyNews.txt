[00:00:20.342 --> 00:00:22.485]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:24.208]  I'm your host, Margaret Howell.
[00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:26.811]  It's Wednesday, December 7th, 2016.
[00:00:26.872 --> 00:00:28.474]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:33.183 --> 00:00:35.604]  It's the ultimate fake news list!
[00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:47.791]  Isn't it ironic how the mainstream media has the nerve to lecture us about fake news when they're the ones who publish the most harmful, inaccurate news of all?
[00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:56.516]  InfoWars has put together a hit list of the real fake news outlets and the establishment media is going down!
[00:00:57.156 --> 00:00:57.377]  Then...
[00:00:58.504 --> 00:01:02.626]  Look who just made Time Magazine's Person of the Year.
[00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:06.707]  The President of the Divided States of America?
[00:01:07.047 --> 00:01:20.092]  Plus, Donald Trump has invited tech industry leaders to a roundtable discussion next week in New York as the President-elect continues his plans to rebuild America.
[00:01:21.652 --> 00:01:25.394]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:36.957]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.
[00:01:37.057 --> 00:01:44.721]  We're making freedom go viral, and now we are proud to announce a new weapon in the epic battle against the globalists.
[00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:55.727]  InfoWars Prime, where you can watch live high-definition feeds of the Alex Jones Show, plus exclusive insider videos from the InfoWars crew and behind-the-scenes

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:06.399]  It's the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, December 7th, 1941.
[00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:12.685]  I just want to take this time before we get started to say thank you so much to all of our veterans and veteran InfoWarriors out there.
[00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:13.386]  We love you.
[00:03:13.446 --> 00:03:14.687]  We thank you for your service.
[00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:18.230]  We want to honor you today, especially in light of what's happening.
[00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.233]  Our first story up, and when we read this,
[00:03:21.773 --> 00:03:31.501]  Our producer Rob Jacobson actually ran it into Alex's show because it's of such critical importance and the absurdity of it all frankly is remarkable.
[00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:35.504]  Brexit referendum not legally binding, UK Supreme Court told.
[00:03:35.544 --> 00:03:39.467]  Now this aggregated from Reuters and it eventually made its way.
[00:03:39.487 --> 00:03:47.394]  It's up on Infowars written by Michael Holden and this referendum in which the people spoke directly to their government and said we've had enough
[00:03:47.834 --> 00:03:49.015]  We're not taking it anymore.
[00:03:49.076 --> 00:03:49.997]  We're out of the EU.
[00:03:50.037 --> 00:03:51.018]  We're sick of being taxed.
[00:03:51.038 --> 00:03:55.182]  We're sick of being told how many people we have to take and what they're doing to our communities.
[00:03:55.422 --> 00:04:04.853]  And the Supreme Court, they're trying to use this Article 50 by the end of March, and it's part of the Lisbon Treaty, the EU Lisbon Treaty.
[00:04:05.653 --> 00:04:14.195]  It's the first formal step in the process of leaving the bloc, but they're trying to invoke this article that says that Parliament, the UK Parliament, actually has to give its approval.
[00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:16.676]  It's, quote, explicit approval.
[00:04:17.496 --> 00:04:26.718]  If the Supreme Court upholds the ruling, the risk for government is that the proceedings in Parliament could delay the Prime Minister, Theresa May, her plan to trigger this article.
[00:04:26.778 --> 00:04:29.999]  So it looks like they're trying to jeopardize that already.
[00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:33.000]  Hasn't even happened yet, but there you go folks.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.742]  I mean the globalists, they of course cannot handle the fact that people don't want them running their government anymore.
[00:04:39.762 --> 00:04:42.103]  There's a wave of nationalism sweeping the globe.
[00:04:42.443 --> 00:04:44.004]  It looks like it's about to hit Germany next.
[00:04:44.064 --> 00:04:52.246]  Now, here in the US there's a battle underway and our boss Alex Jones hit the hammer on the head beautifully today talking about the ultimate fake news list.
[00:04:52.867 --> 00:04:56.408]  Of course, we have an article up written by Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones.
[00:04:57.228 --> 00:05:00.730]  It talks about who the real fake news purveyors are in this country.
[00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.093]  They just can't handle the fact that we tell you the truth and we're winning, by the way.
[00:05:05.113 --> 00:05:07.755]  We have a list of fake news outlets.
[00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:08.856]  I'm going to run through them quickly.
[00:05:08.896 --> 00:05:09.636]  The New York Times.
[00:05:10.037 --> 00:05:21.624]  Liz Spade, by the way, was on Tucker Carlson's show apologizing with her tail between her legs for all of the nasty little tweets that her reporters over there at the New York Times had to say about Donald Trump.
[00:05:21.644 --> 00:05:22.425]  They're backpedaling now.
[00:05:22.925 --> 00:05:32.970]  Of course the Washington Post, CNN, NBC, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, Salon, Huffington Post, Rolling Stone, BBC News, Sky News, Financial Times, Politico.
[00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.590]  We have this laundry list.
[00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:37.212]  Here's Alex Jones explaining more.
[00:05:38.732 --> 00:05:50.538]  The current attack on free speech worldwide is so intense, so classically totalitarian, that quite frankly I'm having trouble even believing it's this bad.
[00:05:51.271 --> 00:05:57.015]  They have been incrementally trying to erode free speech and a free press for a long time in Europe and the United States.
[00:05:57.635 --> 00:06:05.701]  In the last few years we've seen Zuckerberg meet with the communist Chinese censors and pledge to them and Merkel that they would bring censorship here to the United States.
[00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:13.606]  Matt Drudge came here a year ago and warned us that he talked to a Supreme Court justice and others and they were told censorship was coming in 2016.
[00:06:14.747 --> 00:06:20.831]  We've seen the internet handed over October 1st of this year to a international consortium headed up
[00:06:21.671 --> 00:06:27.856]  By the United Nations, with countries like Saudi Arabia on the board deciding what can be on the web and what can't.
[00:06:28.696 --> 00:06:41.225]  Now, the European Union Commission, unelected, came out and gave Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other tech giants 24 hours to censor a list of, quote, fake news that they've issued.
[00:06:41.505 --> 00:06:46.568]  That Infowars.com is on, that DrugsReport.com is on, that Breitbart.com is on.
[00:06:46.588 --> 00:06:48.470]  And they mix it with stuff like The Onion.
[00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.191]  This is outrageous.
[00:06:50.251 --> 00:06:54.653]  You have to sue someone to prove something's a fraud and then shut them down via damages.
[00:06:55.274 --> 00:07:02.818]  You can't, in a free society like the Communist Chinese do, say something's fake news because it criticizes the Central Committee and just arrests people.
[00:07:03.238 --> 00:07:04.139]  But I'm here to tell you
[00:07:04.679 --> 00:07:06.980]  They've bitten off more than they can chew, in my view.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.641]  We saw mainstream media further discredit itself with fake polls, lying.
[00:07:13.162 --> 00:07:16.823]  They got caught coordinating themselves with the White House, with Hillary.
[00:07:17.263 --> 00:07:18.883]  It's truly disgusting.
[00:07:19.623 --> 00:07:27.866]  And now, we've seen the Washington Post, New York Times, you name it, come out, Politico, and say, time to censor Donald Trump, the President of the United States.
[00:07:29.224 --> 00:07:33.910]  For his Twitter saying it's bullying that he calls people liars and scumbags.
[00:07:34.091 --> 00:07:41.461]  This is how they plan to bring in the political correctness where only nationalists and patriots and conservatives and veterans are censored.
[00:07:42.694 --> 00:07:44.575]  No, we know the fake news in this media.
[00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:50.300]  CNN, namely, is the primary culprit for me as a reporter because they spout lie after lie after lie.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.321]  I don't know who watches them anyway.
[00:07:52.421 --> 00:07:55.744]  Who the heck turns it on other than airports and hospitals?
[00:07:56.124 --> 00:07:58.326]  Those are the only two places I've ever really seen CNN.
[00:07:58.426 --> 00:08:00.908]  I never turn it on myself, willingly.
[00:08:00.968 --> 00:08:02.169]  Sometimes you just can't help it.
[00:08:02.529 --> 00:08:08.574]  But if you recall, they were trying to spout the narrative that Donald Trump, he was like the second coming of Hitler, basically.
[00:08:08.594 --> 00:08:11.416]  You've got Van Jones talking about white lash, which is why he won.
[00:08:11.736 --> 00:08:12.897]  Hey, guess what, Van Jones?
[00:08:12.937 --> 00:08:14.238]  That's not why Donald Trump won.
[00:08:14.258 --> 00:08:25.085]  Donald Trump won overwhelmingly because tens of millions of people voted for him, including Hispanics, including black Americans, including Latinos, including Muslims, including whites.
[00:08:25.485 --> 00:08:28.067]  It has nothing to do with race, you idiots over there.
[00:08:28.587 --> 00:08:32.950]  And spouting lie after lie after lie, I just want to take you through a couple of these lies really quickly.
[00:08:34.071 --> 00:08:35.292]  Weapons of mass destruction.
[00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:36.973]  How many of you out there remember that?
[00:08:37.133 --> 00:08:40.435]  Weapons of mass destruction, which is why we went into war with Iraq.
[00:08:40.755 --> 00:08:41.216]  Turns out,
[00:08:41.836 --> 00:08:44.098]  Nothing to do with weapons of mass destruction.
[00:08:45.579 --> 00:08:51.123]  We'll get into that discussion another day, but mainstream media lie, of course, has been debunked.
[00:08:52.444 --> 00:08:56.907]  Another one talking about the Syrian rebels and how it's a humanitarian cause.
[00:08:56.947 --> 00:09:06.334]  Turns out most of them are aligned with al-Qaeda, al-Nusra, and ISIS, and we've had a hand in supporting them because the overall
[00:09:07.655 --> 00:09:07.856]  Yeah.
[00:09:25.572 --> 00:09:28.715]  I nearly fell out of my chair, frankly, folks, because who does he think he is?
[00:09:29.096 --> 00:09:34.200]  This man, we have covered some of the things that he has said on InfoWars in the past couple of months.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.464]  Of course, he was a higher up in the Clinton campaign.
[00:09:37.504 --> 00:09:40.206]  He's a Democratic Party insider, if you will.
[00:09:41.227 --> 00:09:45.688]  And he actually said that he wants his own version of Breitbart.
[00:09:46.508 --> 00:09:47.569]  I cannot make this up.
[00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:54.711]  He says a lot of garbage came spewing out of Facebook during the election and these companies need to adopt new standards and clean their own house.
[00:09:55.151 --> 00:09:58.672]  He then goes on to add we'll be involved in a campaign to push them to do that.
[00:09:59.192 --> 00:10:03.733]  He talks about having a media startup that is similar to Breitbart.
[00:10:04.173 --> 00:10:06.295]  And you know, I honestly, I'm sorry.
[00:10:06.315 --> 00:10:20.750]  This is so funny to me because they were, all of the millions and millions of dollars that they spent on crafting a narrative in the media, all of those lies, all of the money that went into this, and now he's jealous of Breitbart News.
[00:10:21.611 --> 00:10:22.952]  That's insane, folks, right there.
[00:10:22.992 --> 00:10:34.916]  He wants his own Breitbart News, except for the left, which also echoes President Obama, because he's recently been saying that he's going to get into media when he leaves office, because he realizes the power of real media.
[00:10:35.036 --> 00:10:36.216]  And it comes down to you.
[00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:37.797]  You're who matter out there.
[00:10:37.877 --> 00:10:38.877]  You're the real media.
[00:10:39.417 --> 00:10:47.540]  And, you know, being in the business that we're in, wanting to give people the truth and the hard facts, you guys are the reason this works, frankly.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:48.500]  Yeah.
[00:11:06.701 --> 00:11:07.162]  I think so.
[00:11:26.002 --> 00:11:30.906]  And they're pledging $50 billion in investments, creating 50,000 U.S.
[00:11:31.527 --> 00:11:31.907]  jobs.
[00:11:32.308 --> 00:11:34.169]  The man isn't even president yet.
[00:11:34.229 --> 00:11:38.993]  He's already creating what some estimate as 50,000 jobs coming out of this.
[00:11:39.033 --> 00:11:47.701]  Of course, Mr. Sun and President-elect Trump were in Trump Tower at the bottom yesterday, around those famous elevators, talking about this.
[00:11:47.901 --> 00:11:49.803]  And here's Alex with more of the story.
[00:11:51.291 --> 00:11:59.399]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, $50 billion is now being announced to be invested in high-tech in the United States by the Japanese.
[00:11:59.859 --> 00:12:05.004]  Chief Executive and Chairman of the SoftBank Group, Masayoshi Son,
[00:12:05.919 --> 00:12:11.080]  It's estimated that the deal, if it goes through, will create at least 50,000 new jobs in the United States only in the first year.
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:16.201]  Mr. Sun, the head of one of the most powerful Japanese corporate conglomerates, visited Trump Tower today and told reporters
[00:12:30.845 --> 00:12:36.636]  They had made the decision, now that the United States had different leadership, that was basically towards growth.
[00:12:37.671 --> 00:12:53.220]  But even the Wall Street Journal had little snide remarks like, Mr. Trump claims responsibility for the announcement that Mr. Sun is making when Mr. Sun made the announcement from Trump Tower and gave Trump credit.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.703]  Mr. Sun also has a history of going straight to national leaders to talk business.
[00:12:58.063 --> 00:13:05.047]  In September, he met with South Korean president and pledged to invest $4.5 billion in the country's technology sector.
[00:13:05.367 --> 00:13:15.237]  Now let's go over a list of the super high-tech jobs that he's pledging to bring the United States, reversing the flow of high-technology jobs out of the nation.
[00:13:15.377 --> 00:13:19.101]  The $50 billion comes from the overall $100 billion fund.
[00:13:19.701 --> 00:13:26.388]  Mr. Sun plans to spend heavily in fields including the so-called Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and robotics.
[00:13:26.788 --> 00:13:29.271]  He has said he wants to become the Warren Buffett of
[00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:30.292]  We're good to go.
[00:13:46.974 --> 00:13:56.198]  I don't think that there's an American family out there that hasn't been touched by the war in Afghanistan in some form or another, a relative, a service member, or a friend serving.
[00:13:56.238 --> 00:14:06.462]  We're talking about 15 years of this, folks, and it makes me really angry because it turns out that our BFF Saudi Arabia, they've been funding bankrolling the Taliban.
[00:14:06.502 --> 00:14:08.083]  This is on the cover of the New York Times.
[00:14:08.343 --> 00:14:09.604]  I cannot make this up.
[00:14:09.684 --> 00:14:14.626]  So we're in bed with Saudi Arabia, and forgive me for yelling, but this is ridiculous.
[00:14:15.206 --> 00:14:15.566]  We're good.
[00:14:32.114 --> 00:14:39.858]  For some reason, they're able to thrive and succeed and it's largely because of Saudi Arabia.
[00:14:39.918 --> 00:14:41.219]  So I want to take you to this article.
[00:14:41.239 --> 00:14:42.219]  It's 13 pages in length.
[00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:47.342]  I personally don't like citing the New York Times, but when something like this pops up, you can't help but mention it.
[00:14:48.302 --> 00:15:00.249]  In this interview with the New York Times, this former Taliban finance minister described how he traveled to Saudi Arabia, I'm directly quoting here, from years raising cash while ostensibly doing his pilgrimage, the Hajj.
[00:15:00.289 --> 00:15:02.370]  He was able to collect money.
[00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:12.936]  And then we go on to say, to talk about Prince Turki al-Faisal, who led the Saudi intelligence agency for 24 years, also an ambassador to the U.S., by the way.
[00:15:13.516 --> 00:15:14.237]  Isn't that nice?
[00:15:14.657 --> 00:15:19.982]  Until his retirement in 2007, he rejected any suggestion that Saudi Arabia had ever supported the Taliban.
[00:15:20.422 --> 00:15:35.255]  But in recent months, the Taliban has mounted and coordinated offensive, a measure that includes 40,000 fighters, according to this article, in eight provinces and pushed, you know, largely because they were able to finance themselves through foreign sources.
[00:15:36.696 --> 00:15:39.018]  And this article says at the cost of one billion.
[00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:42.541]  Where the heck are they getting at, folks, is my question.
[00:15:43.061 --> 00:15:43.962]  It looks like Saudi Arabia.
[00:15:44.242 --> 00:15:51.708]  Meanwhile, we're supplying them arms to the tune of the billions because we just can't help ourselves and we want them to be able to bomb Yemen.
[00:15:51.728 --> 00:15:55.932]  Another story for another day, but moving right along, the cover of Time.
[00:15:55.972 --> 00:16:04.198]  And I love this story today because Trump, he really took it like a gentleman when I heard him talk about his love of Time magazine and how he looked at it.
[00:16:04.278 --> 00:16:07.621]  As a little boy, he was honored the fact that he was named Person of the Year this year.
[00:16:07.641 --> 00:16:12.625]  It really touched me because you could really feel that he was pretty sincere about it.
[00:16:13.125 --> 00:16:19.208]  At the same time, I want to point out, he's President of the Divided States of America.
[00:16:19.228 --> 00:16:20.348]  That's her title.
[00:16:21.028 --> 00:16:24.290]  And Time Magazine, you know, it's basically a relic.
[00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.931]  It's just a little piece of Americana, which is why we frankly tolerate it.
[00:16:28.331 --> 00:16:30.372]  They put Adolf Hitler on their cover.
[00:16:31.433 --> 00:16:33.934]  And doing this, it seemed like a backhanded compliment.
[00:16:33.974 --> 00:16:39.196]  Let's not forget, there was another Time not too long ago when they had Trump on their cover.
[00:16:39.236 --> 00:16:41.257]  He sells a lot of magazines, let's just face it.
[00:16:42.217 --> 00:16:47.500]  And they had him melting his face, sort of like a dripping photograph.
[00:16:48.221 --> 00:16:50.502]  And it talks about Trump's meltdown.
[00:16:50.542 --> 00:17:00.008]  So it looks like when he promotes their magazine, when they see he's on top and he couldn't be toppled by their sketchy little commentary, they have to celebrate him now.
[00:17:00.088 --> 00:17:02.930]  So good for you Time Magazine, you finally got on board with the rest of us.
[00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:08.233]  Although I really don't appreciate your little backhanded compliment, neither does the rest of America who voted for Trump.
[00:17:09.294 --> 00:17:12.116]  But hey, whatever helps you sell copies, I'm all for it.
[00:17:12.156 --> 00:17:16.139]  Now, moving right along to another story that I'd like to take you to.
[00:17:16.699 --> 00:17:18.661]  And I found this in the Washington Examiner.
[00:17:18.681 --> 00:17:19.401]  We're running out of time.
[00:17:19.421 --> 00:17:21.523]  I want to skip over some of these and go straight to this one.
[00:17:22.564 --> 00:17:23.644]  Homeland Security.
[00:17:24.185 --> 00:17:30.089]  And let me just tell you right now, under President Obama, our immigration policies have been so run amok.
[00:17:30.509 --> 00:17:33.712]  It's amazing we're still a country, frankly, looking at this as a reporter.
[00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:35.133]  You see articles like this.
[00:17:35.153 --> 00:17:36.034]  They're not partisan.
[00:17:36.154 --> 00:17:37.595]  This was in the Washington Examiner.
[00:17:38.295 --> 00:17:42.737]  And just to headline Homeland Security, 900% surge in asylum demands.
[00:17:43.257 --> 00:17:46.058]  Only half of illegals are caught at the border.
[00:17:46.378 --> 00:17:52.220]  A damning new report on the administration's immigration policy, which are completely defunct, demands asylum.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:52.980]  It's exploded by 900%.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:57.802]  It went from 17,000 to 170,000 under President Obama.
[00:17:57.822 --> 00:17:58.962]  That's according to DHS.
[00:17:59.622 --> 00:18:03.304]  And 81% of all illegals are apprehended crossing the border.
[00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:06.645]  So it looks like our border protection agents are doing their job.
[00:18:07.065 --> 00:18:13.649]  But 54% of them, according to this article, are actually apprehended and assessed.
[00:18:14.009 --> 00:18:18.051]  And they know that demanding asylum works, apparently.
[00:18:18.071 --> 00:18:26.335]  And it looks like that's where they're, you know, they've listened to our president and this asylum staff, and it looks like it's working.
[00:18:26.696 --> 00:18:29.457]  900% increase in asylum demands under his presidency.
[00:18:29.497 --> 00:18:30.718]  That on the Washington Examiner.
[00:18:31.178 --> 00:18:32.179]  I want to take you briefly.
[00:18:32.199 --> 00:18:38.241]  We're running out of time with a story about how Americans are paying Apple, the company Apple, millions to shelter overseas profits.
[00:18:38.301 --> 00:18:41.943]  According to this one article, it's up on Bloomberg Finance.
[00:18:42.343 --> 00:18:45.784]  They're taking advantage of the honor system, tax exemption and blurred lines.
[00:18:46.205 --> 00:18:51.787]  On the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, I want to take this time once more to say, hey, veterans, we love you.
[00:18:51.867 --> 00:18:52.788]  We support you.
[00:18:52.828 --> 00:18:54.428]  Thank you so much for your service.
[00:18:54.948 --> 00:18:58.110]  Joining me coming up next in studio is Leanne McAdoo.
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:46.203]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:19:46.884 --> 00:19:48.465]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:19:48.865 --> 00:19:53.848]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:19:54.208 --> 00:19:59.652]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:20:00.052 --> 00:20:06.636]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:20:07.277 --> 00:20:08.438]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:20:09.278 --> 00:20:11.219]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.501]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:20:14.942 --> 00:20:18.564]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:20:18.744 --> 00:20:21.306]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:20:21.366 --> 00:20:33.714]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:20:33.934 --> 00:20:39.055]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:40.496]  It's bound.
[00:20:40.776 --> 00:20:41.776]  It's not absorbable.
[00:20:42.196 --> 00:20:46.758]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:20:46.978 --> 00:20:51.879]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride and all these other bad halogens.
[00:20:52.239 --> 00:20:55.940]  It's such a game changer if you'll just research iodine for yourself.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.681]  It's a fact that the federal government in the Midwest back in the 20s
[00:20:59.241 --> 00:21:08.206]  Mandated a grungier form of iodine to the salt because people had low IQs, they had huge goiters, major problems directly connected to it.
[00:21:08.386 --> 00:21:12.048]  There are some studies that show a 15 point increase, others show even higher.
[00:21:12.208 --> 00:21:25.656]  But it really is crazy to realize that this is something that is so deficient in our food chain, so deficient in our played out fields where different crops are being grown, but the federal government isn't educating people and telling them about it.
[00:21:25.856 --> 00:21:37.399]  That's why for a limited time, I want to encourage everyone to go to Infowarslife.com and get 20% off on the best nascent iodine out there from our research, Truly Pure Survival Shield X2.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.260]  Again, that's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.461]  Thank you for joining us in this brief news update.
[00:21:43.841 --> 00:21:48.743]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:21:48.823 --> 00:21:49.983]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:52.724]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:21:52.884 --> 00:21:53.104]  Of course!
[00:22:15.742 --> 00:22:19.404]  You've got to have vitamin C, you've got to have iodine to live, you've got to have water to live.
[00:22:19.744 --> 00:22:30.249]  Iodine is key, you must have it, but consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com, or call toll free, we can answer your questions, 888-253-3139.
[00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:32.630]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[00:22:43.925 --> 00:22:45.367]  It's a fight for our minds.
[00:22:46.048 --> 00:22:47.970]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:52.516]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:22:52.656 --> 00:22:53.136]  It's free.
[00:22:53.237 --> 00:22:53.977]  It's on Droid.
[00:22:54.318 --> 00:22:55.459]  It's on Apple.
[00:22:55.559 --> 00:22:56.000]  You name it.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.622]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:23:04.718 --> 00:23:27.866]  President Barack Obama, the man that refuses to recognize radicalized Islam, spoke to the troops yesterday doing what he does best, yet again attempting to pull a fast one on the American people, displaying an arrogant, blissful ignorance of the 11 self-radicalized, homegrown terrorists and foreign-trained terrorist events that have catapulted Donald Trump into the White House.
[00:23:28.106 --> 00:23:31.947]  We should take great pride in the progress that we've made over the last eight years.
[00:23:34.482 --> 00:23:35.284]  That's the bottom line.
[00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:45.325]  No foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland.
[00:23:53.712 --> 00:23:57.034]  Well, Christina, Mohammed was taken to jail just a few hours ago.
[00:23:57.174 --> 00:24:03.417]  Police say he apparently targeted military personnel because of his political and religious beliefs.
[00:24:03.797 --> 00:24:15.684]  ABC News has learned Mohammed just returned from a trip to Yemen and had apparently already become the target of an FBI investigation surrounding a passport issue.
[00:24:16.818 --> 00:24:23.764]  I don't think it was murder, because murder is when a person kills another person without justifying reason.
[00:24:23.965 --> 00:24:27.408]  Definitely, Muslims in this country and elsewhere are going to tax the U.S.
[00:24:27.508 --> 00:24:28.769]  for doing those things they did.
[00:24:29.129 --> 00:24:36.276]  No foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland.
[00:24:37.225 --> 00:24:45.010]  Authorities say the shooter is 39-year-old Major Nidal Malik Hassan, a military psychiatrist who was reportedly about to be shipped overseas.
[00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:50.734]  He apparently walked into a processing center Thursday afternoon and opened fire on his fellow comrades.
[00:24:51.094 --> 00:24:52.755]  At least 13 people died.
[00:24:52.775 --> 00:24:54.496]  31 others were wounded.
[00:24:54.516 --> 00:25:02.882]  Alaki, who was once the imam at the Virginia mosque Hassan attended, is an influential voice spewing anti-American rhetoric from his exile in Yemen.
[00:25:03.522 --> 00:25:08.685]  He had known connections with three of the 9-11 terrorists, and he's an ongoing inspiration for radicals.
[00:25:09.185 --> 00:25:12.747]  Today, on his website, Alaki praised Hassan's rampage.
[00:25:13.147 --> 00:25:20.311]  No foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland.
[00:25:21.038 --> 00:25:31.842]  The reality of the situation is it is almost impossible to protect an event, especially one that is over a protracted space, as a marathon is.
[00:25:32.062 --> 00:25:35.363]  And, you know, I hate to say it, but these are the times that we live in.
[00:25:36.044 --> 00:25:38.024]  Richard, that's what they're saying on CNN.
[00:25:38.044 --> 00:25:40.866]  So they're already basically saying it's a terror attack.
[00:25:40.926 --> 00:25:43.987]  When he said, you know, unfortunately, these are the times we live in.
[00:25:44.807 --> 00:25:55.152]  So then when we see soldiers, and our kids literally again, we see soldiers, you know, everywhere, we're supposed to feel safe?
[00:25:55.452 --> 00:26:03.356]  We saw one bomb go off, we both saw the finish line, and then we saw another one go off 50 or 100 yards, and we were the next 50 yards.
[00:26:03.516 --> 00:26:05.136]  It was loud and thunderous.
[00:26:05.637 --> 00:26:09.258]  It made us, my back still hurts from shaking back, and we were 100 yards away.
[00:26:11.417 --> 00:26:13.459]  We saw everything.
[00:26:13.499 --> 00:26:21.926]  Guys in uniforms, the same boots, the same pants, the same black shirts and coats with backpacks all over the last mile.
[00:26:22.566 --> 00:26:25.509]  And there's people walking around with what looks like detonators in their hands.
[00:26:25.749 --> 00:26:37.238]  And all this is going on and there's like patsies whose bags match the wreckage of what the news put on air and said was the remains of the black canvas bags.
[00:26:37.979 --> 00:26:40.001]  No foreign terrorist organization
[00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:45.108]  has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland.
[00:26:45.848 --> 00:26:49.671]  Federal investigators now working to learn more about Alton Nolan.
[00:26:49.751 --> 00:26:54.654]  He's now the only suspect in a gruesome attack leaving one woman stabbed and another beheaded.
[00:26:54.734 --> 00:27:04.100]  YPD terrorism expert John Miller says a search of computers and social media shows Thompson had anti-western, anti-government, and anti-white views.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.161]  And a fascination with Middle East terror.
[00:27:07.482 --> 00:27:09.663]  Thompson was a recent convert to Islam.
[00:27:09.863 --> 00:27:23.690]  Visiting websites that are focused on designated terrorist groups, Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Al-Shabaab, as well as looking at different acts of violence, including beheadings.
[00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:30.033]  The hatchet attack Thursday on busy Jamaica Avenue is similar to a London, England attack that happened last year.
[00:27:30.233 --> 00:27:34.276]  This is such a huge tragedy for the NYPD and for all of New York City.
[00:27:34.697 --> 00:27:37.759]  We're hearing that two police officers have been killed.
[00:27:38.139 --> 00:27:50.850]  They were sitting in their patrol car here at Tompkins and Myrtle Avenues, and they were in their patrol car, sitting there at 2.40 in the afternoon, when they were each shot once in the head.
[00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:55.754]  At least two suspects have been shot outside the Burdett Call Law Center here in Garland.
[00:27:56.234 --> 00:27:58.096]  And very quickly, Christopher, what was this event?
[00:27:59.241 --> 00:28:05.483]  It was an art expo and art contest depicting the Prophet Muhammad.
[00:28:05.523 --> 00:28:09.745]  So various artists from around the country were represented today.
[00:28:10.165 --> 00:28:17.528]  No foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland.
[00:28:18.351 --> 00:28:19.272]  Today, the U.S.
[00:28:19.352 --> 00:28:23.214]  military came under attack, not overseas, but here at home.
[00:28:23.875 --> 00:28:28.358]  A gunman opened fire at two military facilities in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
[00:28:28.998 --> 00:28:31.440]  Four Marines were killed and another was wounded.
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.083]  A police officer and one other person were also wounded.
[00:28:35.743 --> 00:28:44.069]  Their names have not yet been released, but the gunman is identified as 24-year-old Muhammad Yusuf Abdulaziz.
[00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:48.512]  He was born in Kuwait, but lived in the Chattanooga area.
[00:28:48.532 --> 00:28:56.137]  The inland regional center that was attacked in San Bernardino, California, had been conducting active shooter drills for months.
[00:28:56.517 --> 00:29:03.162]  The LA Times writes, at first, Dorothy Vong assumed it was a drill, just like all the others at her work.
[00:29:03.422 --> 00:29:04.043]  I don't think so.
[00:29:23.081 --> 00:29:27.486]  The FBI immediately believed that this was an Islamic attack.
[00:29:27.526 --> 00:29:30.889]  It was simply because of that phone call that the shooter made.
[00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:32.411]  He made a call to 911 around that time.
[00:29:48.947 --> 00:30:09.060]  18-year-old Somali refugee Abdul Razak Ali Artan, who obtained a green card to enter the United States in 2014, injured 11 students on the Ohio State University campus yesterday, first striking them with a car and then exiting the car to attack the students with a butcher knife.
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:20.410]  WorldNet Daily reports Campus Police Chief Craig Stone said, Our officer was on the scene in less than a minute and he ended the situation in less than a minute.
[00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:23.693]  He engaged the suspect and he eliminated the threat.
[00:30:24.053 --> 00:30:26.015]  The suspect is DOA.
[00:30:26.255 --> 00:30:34.783]  Artan had been quoted in the campus newspaper, The Lantern, several months ago complaining about the school's lack of Islamic prayer rooms.
[00:30:35.123 --> 00:30:42.045]  He blamed the negative view Americans have of Muslims on Islamophobia planted in their minds by the U.S.
[00:30:42.125 --> 00:30:42.445]  media.
[00:30:42.525 --> 00:30:47.067]  Eight years of ignoring a serious problem doesn't make it go away.
[00:30:47.487 --> 00:30:54.629]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com And we want a strong military, and we don't want to have to use it.
[00:30:55.889 --> 00:30:57.310]  Ideally, we don't have to use it.
[00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:01.251]  Although, we will destroy ISIS.
[00:31:09.056 --> 00:31:16.002]  At the same time, we will pursue a new foreign policy that finally learns from the mistakes of the past.
[00:31:16.482 --> 00:31:22.287]  We will stop looking to topple regimes and overthrow governments, folks.
[00:31:23.708 --> 00:31:25.910]  Remember, six trillion dollars.
[00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:26.750]  Six trillion.
[00:31:27.251 --> 00:31:28.031]  In the Middle East.
[00:31:29.152 --> 00:31:30.313]  Six trillion.
[00:31:30.974 --> 00:31:33.436]  Our goal is stability, not chaos.
[00:31:34.312 --> 00:31:37.746]  Because we want to rebuild our country.
[00:31:37.826 --> 00:31:38.449]  It's time.
[00:31:39.393 --> 00:31:39.935]  It's time.
[00:31:42.557 --> 00:31:51.879]  We will partner with any nation that is willing to join us in the effort to defeat ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism.
[00:31:52.239 --> 00:31:53.800]  Okay, we have to say the term.
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:54.800]  Have to say the term.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:03.802]  We're going to seek a truly inclusive society where we support each other, love each other, and look out for each other.
[00:32:04.222 --> 00:32:10.904]  And that means that people coming into our country have to be people that have the potential
[00:32:11.324 --> 00:32:13.105]  To love us, not to hate us.
[00:32:16.948 --> 00:32:20.570]  The job of the president is to keep America safe.
[00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:24.953]  And that will always be my highest priority.
[00:32:29.556 --> 00:32:36.500]  We will do everything in our power to keep this scourge of terrorism out of our country.
[00:32:37.501 --> 00:32:39.482]  We're going to keep it out of our country.
[00:32:40.663 --> 00:32:46.911]  Just so you understand, people are pouring in from regions of the Middle East.
[00:32:47.472 --> 00:32:58.167]  We have no idea who they are, where they come from, what they're thinking, and we're going to stop that dead cold flat.
[00:33:02.435 --> 00:33:07.218]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[00:33:07.418 --> 00:33:08.999]  I ran six miles almost every day.
[00:33:09.019 --> 00:33:11.840]  I would lift weights four or five days a week for up to three hours.
[00:33:12.401 --> 00:33:16.983]  I was really into what I was doing, but I also loved to go to buffets and pig out.
[00:33:17.023 --> 00:33:17.704]  I was a young man.
[00:33:18.304 --> 00:33:20.345]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down.
[00:33:20.726 --> 00:33:21.686]  I quit working out.
[00:33:21.766 --> 00:33:27.069]  I was working 18 hours a day, many days, on average about 14, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:33.652]  I went from 180 to right up to 280 pounds.
[00:33:33.832 --> 00:33:36.753]  And I started to exercise really hard again.
[00:33:37.173 --> 00:33:38.753]  And I started to try to eat healthier.
[00:33:39.233 --> 00:33:41.414]  But for some reason, I couldn't lose more than 20 pounds.
[00:33:41.494 --> 00:33:43.895]  Couldn't go below about 259.
[00:33:45.075 --> 00:33:46.716]  Started taking third-party supplements.
[00:33:47.116 --> 00:33:48.936]  Started seeing some more gains.
[00:33:49.457 --> 00:33:56.899]  But when I started working with Dr. Grip and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that
[00:33:57.319 --> 00:33:59.720]  The population is absolutely deficient in.
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:06.463]  Take this true atomic iodine that they were just developing and wasn't even available in stores yet.
[00:34:07.123 --> 00:34:07.464]  Boom!
[00:34:08.184 --> 00:34:09.625]  Weight started pouring off.
[00:34:09.725 --> 00:34:11.605]  Toxins started coming out of my body.
[00:34:12.106 --> 00:34:12.926]  It was incredible.
[00:34:12.966 --> 00:34:18.548]  Then I started taking DNA force, super male vitality, and I went down to 230 pounds.
[00:34:18.568 --> 00:34:24.111]  Now understand, that's losing 60, 70 pounds of fat and gaining, I don't know, 20 pounds of muscle?
[00:34:25.086 --> 00:34:25.406]  All I know
[00:34:44.918 --> 00:34:54.265]  But more importantly, I stopped taking the supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[00:34:54.365 --> 00:34:55.326]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[00:34:55.526 --> 00:35:02.051]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put Lazy Susan back on the table and I'm going to start taking it religiously again.
[00:35:02.851 --> 00:35:06.074]  And I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[00:35:06.114 --> 00:35:07.395]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[00:35:07.996 --> 00:35:12.059]  And I've already experienced what this has done before, but this time we're going to document it.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.063]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[00:35:16.624 --> 00:35:20.187]  My gut tells me I'll lose at least 10 pounds even during the holidays.
[00:35:20.567 --> 00:35:45.424]  Taking the supplements because again, it's what I've experienced before but we're gonna see I'm gonna work out just the same probably eat even more But I'm gonna take the x2 the DNA force the super male every single day as it's recommended And we're all gonna see the results look we're making America great again We're restoring the Republic and part of that is making ourselves great again our bodies great again and feeling good about ourselves I don't plan to be some Beach Boy
[00:35:46.164 --> 00:35:48.205]  I've got kind of bodybuilder form.
[00:35:48.225 --> 00:35:48.785]  I'm a big guy.
[00:35:49.085 --> 00:35:53.966]  But we're going to see what happens in the next 30 days together on this journey.
[00:35:53.986 --> 00:35:56.427]  And we'll have updates every week on what's happening.
[00:35:57.147 --> 00:36:04.529]  And we will also then obviously take the four weeks and put it all together in a special report that's going to air January 5th.
[00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.330]  Now, I'll be frank with you.
[00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:07.710]  I'm still having treats.
[00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:09.131]  I'm still living like I normally do.
[00:36:09.371 --> 00:36:10.591]  This wasn't part of what we were about to do.
[00:36:10.631 --> 00:36:11.732]  And I'm not saying it's good.
[00:36:12.052 --> 00:36:12.792]  I'm embarrassed of it.
[00:36:14.249 --> 00:36:14.929]  Mexican Coke.
[00:36:15.409 --> 00:36:17.010]  Buckley's over there and he made the joke earlier.
[00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:19.271]  Oh yeah, you're really going to lose weight drinking Mexican Coke.
[00:36:19.611 --> 00:36:20.912]  I'm just being totally transparent.
[00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:21.892]  I'm going to eat pie.
[00:36:22.252 --> 00:36:22.973]  Christmas is coming up.
[00:36:23.013 --> 00:36:24.953]  I'm going to eat ham and turkey.
[00:36:26.374 --> 00:36:26.934]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:27.514 --> 00:36:27.995]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:28.655 --> 00:36:36.358]  These nutraceuticals have really spoiled me because I work out less and was just losing weight.
[00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:38.439]  As long as I took them.
[00:36:38.479 --> 00:36:40.280]  Then when I quit taking them, I've gained some weight.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.640]  So we're going to see what happens.
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.181]  But I've experienced this.
[00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:45.381]  You need to experience this for yourself.
[00:36:45.501 --> 00:36:46.422]  It's December 5th, 2016.
[00:36:46.542 --> 00:36:50.383]  We're only like 25 days from 2017.
[00:36:51.123 --> 00:37:00.826]  And I want to invite all of the Info Warriors of every race, color and creed that bleed red blood and love liberty, justice and truth to make our bodies great again.
[00:37:05.083 --> 00:37:11.289]  Donald Trump has just appointed Terry Branstad, the governor of Iowa, to be the ambassador to China.
[00:37:11.669 --> 00:37:18.035]  Now this is a very important move because let's recall just a few days ago Donald Trump called Taiwan.
[00:37:18.355 --> 00:37:20.417]  That was something that was frowned upon by many people.
[00:37:20.737 --> 00:37:24.341]  A lot of people felt like the Chinese had their feathers ruffled because of this.
[00:37:24.661 --> 00:37:30.026]  But now putting in Branstad as the ambassador is a positive move, one that has kind of seen
[00:37:30.206 --> 00:37:30.566]  I think so.
[00:37:52.151 --> 00:38:07.189]  I will say, we were in the state building earlier today and there is, I don't want to call it a shrine, but more or less there is a big kind of monument or case with all kinds of stuff honoring the Mayor Branstad here in Iowa.
[00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:09.611]  They really adore him here.
[00:38:09.671 --> 00:38:14.094]  They really like the Governor here, excuse me, the Governor Branstad in Iowa.
[00:38:14.494 --> 00:38:16.296]  So, here in Iowa they love him.
[00:38:16.516 --> 00:38:25.763]  Now is a chance for the people of America to get to know him, get to love him, and hopefully he can maintain a strong relationship with China because it's not going to be easy for him.
[00:38:25.783 --> 00:38:29.245]  Let's recall, Donald Trump has said that he wants to make new deals with China.
[00:38:29.505 --> 00:38:31.767]  He's talked about how China gets the better of us in trade.
[00:38:32.087 --> 00:38:36.531]  So this is a tough job to come in here, maintain a good relationship with China, but also
[00:38:37.051 --> 00:38:42.916]  Have to maintain that while Trump is trying to renegotiate trade deals and get better deals between China and the United States.
[00:38:42.976 --> 00:38:52.605]  So, the governor of Iowa, Terry Branstad, appointed to be the ambassador to China, the latest in Trump's appointments.
[00:38:52.645 --> 00:38:54.887]  He also appointed Linda McMahon.
[00:38:55.347 --> 00:39:01.313]  Today as well, as well as another general from the military to Department of Homeland Security.
[00:39:01.333 --> 00:39:04.957]  So the Trump administration, Trump cabinet is becoming more clear.
[00:39:05.457 --> 00:39:09.742]  And here in Iowa, the governor was just made the ambassador to China.
[00:39:10.002 --> 00:39:12.064]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[00:39:19.397 --> 00:39:20.598]  We were told it was coming.
[00:39:20.898 --> 00:39:21.859]  The evidence was there.
[00:39:22.579 --> 00:39:26.562]  Members of the Federal Communications Commission said they wanted to censor talk radio and the internet.
[00:39:27.083 --> 00:39:29.024]  And now it's been openly announced.
[00:39:29.945 --> 00:39:34.468]  Actually shutting down InfoWars.com and thousands of other prominent sites.
[00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:39.252]  Not because we're fake, but because we expose the fake media.
[00:39:44.395 --> 00:39:47.298]  The current attack on free speech worldwide
[00:39:48.095 --> 00:39:56.182]  is so intense, so classically totalitarian, that quite frankly I'm having trouble even believing it's this bad.
[00:39:56.943 --> 00:40:02.667]  They have been incrementally trying to erode free speech and a free press for a long time in Europe and the United States.
[00:40:03.287 --> 00:40:11.353]  In the last few years we've seen Zuckerberg meet with the Communist Chinese censors and pledge to them and Merkel that they would bring censorship here to the United States.
[00:40:11.813 --> 00:40:18.718]  Matt Drudge came here a year ago and warned us that he talked to a Supreme Court Justice and others and they were told censorship was coming in 2016.
[00:40:20.399 --> 00:40:26.483]  We've seen the Internet handed over October 1st of this year to a international consortium headed up
[00:40:27.323 --> 00:40:33.506]  By the United Nations, with countries like Saudi Arabia on the board deciding what can be on the web and what can't.
[00:40:34.346 --> 00:40:46.872]  Now, the European Union Commission, unelected, came out and gave Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other tech giants 24 hours to censor a list of, quote, fake news that they've issued.
[00:40:47.172 --> 00:40:52.214]  That Infowars.com is on, that DrudgeReport.com is on, that Breitbart.com is on.
[00:40:52.234 --> 00:40:54.135]  And they mixed them with stuff like The Onion.
[00:40:54.835 --> 00:40:55.856]  This is outrageous.
[00:40:55.916 --> 00:41:00.299]  You have to sue someone to prove something's a fraud and then shut them down via damages.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:08.486]  You can't, in a free society like the Communist Chinese do, say something's fake news because it criticizes the Central Committee and just arrests people.
[00:41:08.906 --> 00:41:09.807]  But I'm here to tell you
[00:41:10.347 --> 00:41:12.649]  They've bitten off more than they can chew, in my view.
[00:41:13.229 --> 00:41:18.293]  We saw mainstream media further discredit itself with fake polls, lying.
[00:41:18.814 --> 00:41:22.496]  They got caught coordinating themselves with the White House, with Hillary.
[00:41:22.917 --> 00:41:24.558]  It's truly disgusting.
[00:41:25.278 --> 00:41:33.545]  And now, we've seen the Washington Post, New York Times, you name it, come out, Politico, and say, time to censor Donald Trump, the President of the United States.
[00:41:34.872 --> 00:41:39.573]  For his Twitter saying it's bullying that he calls people liars and scumbags.
[00:41:39.653 --> 00:41:40.973]  That's his right to do.
[00:41:41.253 --> 00:41:42.133]  That's his view.
[00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:44.354]  They're allowed to call him every name under the sun.
[00:41:44.594 --> 00:41:50.035]  They're allowed in the New York Times and LA Times and Newsweek to call for his assassination, which is illegal.
[00:41:50.635 --> 00:41:52.935]  But oh my gosh, he called somebody fat or he did that.
[00:41:53.275 --> 00:42:00.637]  This is how they plan to bring in the political correctness where only nationalists and patriots and conservatives and veterans are censored.
[00:42:01.377 --> 00:42:04.962]  And Twitter responded saying, we're actually going to look at banning the President.
[00:42:05.383 --> 00:42:06.264]  But then it gets worse.
[00:42:06.985 --> 00:42:11.272]  They're attacking us on CBS News, ABC, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, every hour.
[00:42:11.332 --> 00:42:13.815]  I mean, it's so bad, it's good.
[00:42:14.356 --> 00:42:15.758]  Because they're dwindling audiences.
[00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:25.513]  are only going to come to InfoWars.com, and our numbers are just continuing to rise, dwarfing CNN, dwarfing the New York Times Online, according to Quantcast and other services.
[00:42:25.553 --> 00:42:33.015]  But now, self-proclaimed hack in the WikiLeaks, telling Hillary and the Democrats, I'm a hack, I'll lie, I'll do whatever.
[00:42:33.375 --> 00:42:36.636]  You just tell me to say whatever you want, and I'll say it.
[00:42:37.176 --> 00:42:38.237]  Talk about fake news.
[00:42:38.497 --> 00:42:39.338]  Who thinks you're stupid?
[00:42:39.658 --> 00:42:56.551]  Self-proclaimed hack and political writer, Glenn Thrush, participated in an MSNBC discussion where they say it's time to censor the media, it's time to ban discussions of pedophile networks, alleged networks, you name it, and it's time to shut down InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[00:42:57.031 --> 00:43:03.655]  They're really on TV because we've kicked their butts and proven they're the fake news, saying, censor us.
[00:43:04.115 --> 00:43:06.477]  And ladies and gentlemen, if they can censor us, they can censor everybody.
[00:43:06.797 --> 00:43:15.922]  Now, to Matt Taibbi's credit at Rolling Stone, and to journalists at the London Guardian's credit, they've come out and said, this blacklist is incredibly dangerous.
[00:43:16.002 --> 00:43:17.703]  It makes McCarthy look like an angel.
[00:43:18.043 --> 00:43:19.364]  What in the hell are you doing?
[00:43:19.684 --> 00:43:20.345]  Stop it now.
[00:43:21.732 --> 00:43:26.796]  But the decrying of this tyranny is not strong enough from the left, so it may just be good cop, bad cop.
[00:43:26.836 --> 00:43:30.299]  But regardless, throw me in that briar patch any day.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:35.383]  You want to just come out and say I'm fake news when we have a record of being way more accurate than you are?
[00:43:35.664 --> 00:43:37.425]  We're not getting orders from big corporations.
[00:43:37.725 --> 00:43:38.586]  We're self-funded.
[00:43:40.051 --> 00:43:47.496]  You are just butthurt that you work for big, corrupt, global corporations that are constantly starting wars and race baiting.
[00:43:47.976 --> 00:43:55.341]  You're just butthurt that you're just hacks, in your own words, mercenaries that read off teleprompters and aren't your own man, your own woman.
[00:43:55.701 --> 00:44:05.828]  You're so pissed that InfoWars dwarfs 10 or 15 of your biggest organizations together, including the New York Times, and that we're a small operation that's grassroots and gaining steam.
[00:44:06.208 --> 00:44:07.189]  You're scared.
[00:44:07.589 --> 00:44:09.451]  You hate the fact you're not your own person.
[00:44:10.191 --> 00:44:11.673]  And you have zero integrity.
[00:44:12.153 --> 00:44:13.454]  So go ahead and try to ban us.
[00:44:13.474 --> 00:44:15.997]  Go ahead and have Google on Chrome delist us.
[00:44:16.598 --> 00:44:18.560]  Go ahead and have Quantcast take us off.
[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:28.049]  Go ahead and try to imagine we're not there and it'll only make people flock to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and our other sites that much faster.
[00:44:28.369 --> 00:44:29.390]  But I've always done this.
[00:44:30.091 --> 00:44:34.116]  When government-connected hackers brought down Infowars a decade ago, I launched Prison Planet.
[00:44:34.717 --> 00:44:37.200]  When they tried to shut down my radio show, I launched The Nightly News.
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:42.486]  When they physically attacked me and did all sorts of other garbage, I launched a larger network.
[00:44:42.827 --> 00:44:45.650]  So, following in our past formula of liberty,
[00:44:46.351 --> 00:45:04.260]  We're only going to expand InfoWars that much more now in the face of your attempts, and we've never seen such support with listeners spreading our articles and our videos and buying the products at InfoWarsTore.com in response to what you're doing, because they understand we are on target.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:09.842]  In conclusion, I leave you with a historical parallel from the Second Great War, World War II.
[00:45:11.063 --> 00:45:14.865]  And it was a saying that fighter-bomber crews and pilots used.
[00:45:15.819 --> 00:45:18.326]  You know you're over the target when you're getting the flack.
[00:45:18.366 --> 00:45:20.010]  They didn't have radar earlier in the war.
[00:45:20.391 --> 00:45:21.514]  Their maps weren't very good.
[00:45:21.534 --> 00:45:22.336]  They'd get off course.
[00:45:23.151 --> 00:45:26.912]  But they knew to go towards the flack.
[00:45:27.012 --> 00:45:29.953]  They knew to go towards the flames and the burning buildings.
[00:45:30.193 --> 00:45:33.535]  They knew to go to where the smoke was and where the fight was happening.
[00:45:33.735 --> 00:45:38.056]  And those big anti-aircraft guns would be firing up thousands of feet into the air.
[00:45:38.416 --> 00:45:45.279]  And they would turn those bombers in and fly right in over the targets and drop their bombs on those Nazi factories.
[00:45:46.019 --> 00:45:47.100]  And so I leave you with that.
[00:45:47.241 --> 00:45:53.367]  We are over the target and InfoWars is getting more attacks now, some days, than even
[00:45:54.758 --> 00:45:59.182]  The head strategist for the White House, Stephen Bannon, and sometimes even more than Trump himself.
[00:45:59.322 --> 00:46:13.634]  It is epic because they're so scared of the spirit of Infowars, the reawakening of our republic, and the fact that the military, the police, foreign governments, and huge populations listen to us, and they can look at how we're rising exponentially.
[00:46:14.035 --> 00:46:21.201]  So they're pulling the incredibly dangerous move of openly now trying to physically shut us down.
[00:46:21.761 --> 00:46:22.101]  Wow!
[00:46:22.381 --> 00:46:26.504]  I never knew growing up right here in Texas that I'd be at this level fighting tyranny.
[00:46:26.884 --> 00:46:29.886]  I just started a local radio show when I was 21 to promote the Second Amendment.
[00:46:30.666 --> 00:46:35.489]  But I guess, you know, as they've said many times, great times make the person.
[00:46:35.689 --> 00:46:42.933]  And all of us are being forced to really take action and do incredible things because we live in amazing times.
[00:46:43.213 --> 00:46:45.414]  The circumstances are just so incredible.
[00:46:45.735 --> 00:46:47.896]  That's why I always end by saying
[00:46:48.789 --> 00:46:49.370]  You're the hope.
[00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:50.131]  You're the answer.
[00:46:50.411 --> 00:46:54.836]  If you are watching this transmission, if you're listening to this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:47:03.024 --> 00:47:11.171]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:20.958]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.379 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.302 --> 00:47:28.304]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.324 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.
[00:47:53.493 --> 00:47:54.533]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.

[00:48:59.626 --> 00:49:02.287]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:05.077 --> 00:49:11.203]  Well this past week we have seen an unprecedented amount of articles in mainstream media talking about fake news.
[00:49:11.543 --> 00:49:13.865]  They're targeting us here at InfoWars personally.
[00:49:14.346 --> 00:49:17.188]  And joining me now in studio is Leanne McAdoo.
[00:49:17.208 --> 00:49:21.312]  We're going to be discussing these fake news trends and how they're really going out.
[00:49:21.693 --> 00:49:23.815]  You know, nothing holding back here, Leanne.
[00:49:23.835 --> 00:49:25.156]  You brought some articles for us.
[00:49:25.877 --> 00:49:26.818]  Why the aggression?
[00:49:26.878 --> 00:49:27.238]  Why now?
[00:49:27.278 --> 00:49:46.895]  Well we know this is the new CIA buzzword that they're using fake news because conspiracy theorists people now hold that as a badge of honor so you know I hate to keep talking about fake news and a lot of people are saying so because just all you're talking about is fake news but this is so important we have to push back against this because it's not enough to them that they have for the last you know
[00:49:47.615 --> 00:49:53.921]  At least two, if not ten plus years, policed our language, they policed our thought, but that was not good enough for them.
[00:49:53.961 --> 00:50:09.075]  Now that they're the losers and they didn't win this election, even though they had all hands on deck to get Clinton in to push her progressive agenda, now that they've lost, they have set their sights on actually shutting down any dissenting opinions altogether, including us saying that we're
[00:50:09.155 --> 00:50:09.715]  I don't know.
[00:50:28.486 --> 00:50:39.810]  And so now they're really ramping up these efforts, inciting violence, reporting on racist, fake hate crime, hoaxes, and of course anti-government messages.
[00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:40.530]  This I love.
[00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:48.773]  Time Magazine is actually telling 65 million plus Americans to stop paying taxes because they don't like the way the election turned out.
[00:50:49.013 --> 00:51:02.679]  Now you'll recall just a year or so ago when we were talking about this kind of stuff, we're anti-government, anti, you know, non-patriotic, how dare you not pay into the system, you know, but now that it didn't go their way, they're the ones that are being anti-government.
[00:51:02.699 --> 00:51:03.159]  It's crazy.
[00:51:03.559 --> 00:51:13.304]  So Paul Joseph Watson has this pretty exhaustive list of the fake news, but you know, I love you buddy, but you've even forgotten a few of the fake news debacles that are out there.
[00:51:14.604 --> 00:51:22.569]  Like I mentioned, we got the hate crime hoaxes, saying all the support for President Donald Trump was fueled by racism with no evidence of that.
[00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:31.035]  We talked yesterday about CNN running the segment on suggesting that Trump is going to be putting Muslim Americans in internment camps.
[00:51:31.915 --> 00:51:41.423]  And of course, you know, let's not forget that every liberal-leaning media organization in the country repeated without question the hands up, don't shoot lie.
[00:51:41.503 --> 00:51:45.366]  Even after that was debunked, they continued to put the hands up, take pictures.
[00:51:45.726 --> 00:51:55.474]  Sally Cohn, everyone's beloved liberal at the time, tweeted out, only sure facts, according to police, is Mike Brown was unarmed and fleeing with hands up.
[00:51:55.854 --> 00:51:58.116]  No, this was based on a stingroll.
[00:51:58.636 --> 00:52:01.961]  Unreliable witness statement, zero police verification.
[00:52:02.341 --> 00:52:08.089]  The reality that we found out later with the investigation, the autopsy and all that was that Brown was actually shot.
[00:52:08.129 --> 00:52:11.793]  He was assaulting the police officer and trying to take the officer's weapon.
[00:52:12.314 --> 00:52:14.257]  It was a completely fraudulent theory.
[00:52:15.238 --> 00:52:22.065]  And this theory led to riots, violent attacks, looting, civil unrest in Ferguson as well as many other cities.
[00:52:22.446 --> 00:52:28.052]  But the media continued to push this and continued to legitimize this unrest.
[00:52:28.132 --> 00:52:31.296]  And they are continuing to do that by calling for civil unrest.
[00:52:31.856 --> 00:52:34.619]  All of these protests now with the inauguration day.
[00:52:34.639 --> 00:52:35.921]  I mean, who knows what's coming?
[00:52:36.161 --> 00:52:43.467]  Well, you talked about how the mainstream media, they actually are the real purveyors of fake news, and they create death and destruction with these lies.
[00:52:43.608 --> 00:52:55.438]  Namely, just taking you to one example, the weapons of mass destruction which allowed, that was a major lie, folks, and tens of thousands of people died as a result of that lie, both American citizens, soldiers, and Iraqis alike.
[00:52:55.918 --> 00:53:00.803]  And also to just, you know, flip-flopping and saying that it was Iraq who was responsible for 9-11.
[00:53:01.203 --> 00:53:01.363]  I don't
[00:53:25.926 --> 00:53:28.887]  They're losing their appeal, so now we have to swap it with fake news.
[00:53:29.347 --> 00:53:31.347]  And of course they've listed us as fake news.
[00:53:31.368 --> 00:53:47.133]  I don't know if you visited our website lately, but there's a banner talking about, there's a cry to make sure that Trump recognizes that we have been such an advocate for free speech, for the truth, and there's a call for people to actually go on our website.
[00:53:48.034 --> 00:53:48.934]  There's an announcement.
[00:53:48.974 --> 00:53:50.114]  They want to shut us down, Leigh-Anne.
[00:53:50.134 --> 00:53:51.475]  They want to shut anybody down.
[00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:54.257]  That is espousing the lies of the liberal left.
[00:53:54.337 --> 00:53:59.322]  Right, that anything that they decide is fake news, they're wanting to shut it down.
[00:53:59.442 --> 00:54:08.230]  And these are people who have sold us this lie that we needed to arm the rebels in Syria because they're moderate rebels and they don't have jihadist sympathies.
[00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:11.833]  And this is what the president tells us, that they need to be supported.
[00:54:12.073 --> 00:54:16.998]  This led to the destruction of Syria, Libya, and the rise of ISIS.
[00:54:17.378 --> 00:54:18.800]  They are dangerous.
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.822]  I mean, massively dangerous.
[00:54:20.962 --> 00:54:23.305]  And they are creating civil unrest in this country.
[00:54:23.345 --> 00:54:30.913]  They're pushing these really awful policies that are destabilizing now Europe with this migrant crisis because, you know, this created it.
[00:54:31.134 --> 00:54:32.295]  You can't even see people speaking.
[00:54:32.355 --> 00:54:32.955]  We're good to go.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:02.502]  You know, the only way they work is to successfully spout the lies that you and I buy.
[00:55:02.522 --> 00:55:02.822]  Right.
[00:55:02.842 --> 00:55:04.282]  That's the only way this stuff works.
[00:55:04.562 --> 00:55:05.583]  And they're losing the battle.
[00:55:05.623 --> 00:55:07.663]  I covered this just a moment ago.
[00:55:07.723 --> 00:55:22.388]  David Brock, he was so upset with the fact that Hillary Clinton lost because we were able to successfully take her down with the truth that he now wants his own Breitbart because that to him was the reason, along with Drudge and Infowars, why Hillary Clinton lost the election.
[00:55:22.528 --> 00:55:22.708]  Right.
[00:55:23.148 --> 00:55:24.849]  Of course, because of you listening to us.
[00:55:25.469 --> 00:55:29.432]  You're the real resistance out there and taking this message and truth and making it global.
[00:55:29.792 --> 00:55:32.754]  So the liberals are so frustrated, they just don't know what to do with themselves.
[00:55:32.774 --> 00:55:32.954]  Right.
[00:55:33.034 --> 00:55:45.241]  And that's what's so, it's so dangerous that they are trying to police the language, police thought, if they can control the way that we even understand words, understand gender, frankly, and just rewrite science and history.
[00:55:45.641 --> 00:55:46.481]  It's so dangerous.
[00:55:46.521 --> 00:55:50.704]  And the fact that they're not taking a pause to self-reflect on why did we lose this election?
[00:55:50.744 --> 00:55:52.185]  Why do people push back?
[00:55:52.945 --> 00:55:56.187]  White-lashly against our policies.
[00:55:56.227 --> 00:55:57.628]  What is this white-lash?
[00:55:57.668 --> 00:55:58.229]  That's why.
[00:55:58.249 --> 00:55:59.109]  CNN called it.
[00:55:59.129 --> 00:56:00.010]  They hit it on the head.
[00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:02.152]  They really just wanted to be honest with you.
[00:56:02.612 --> 00:56:03.512]  It's because of white-lash.
[00:56:03.573 --> 00:56:10.317]  It's because of all of you white nationalist idiots who have no education, who hate everybody else.
[00:56:10.657 --> 00:56:11.638]  That's why Trump won.
[00:56:12.499 --> 00:56:15.701]  Every time I hear those ridiculous... I'm being funny, by the way.
[00:56:16.221 --> 00:56:21.826]  Every time I hear those ridiculous slides, and they're still spouting them, that's the real fake news here, people.
[00:56:21.907 --> 00:56:24.129]  That's what we should be calling out.
[00:56:24.229 --> 00:56:24.769]  Right.
[00:56:24.809 --> 00:56:30.274]  Well, anyone who disagrees with them or was trying to come... WikiLeaks was a tool of Russian intelligence.
[00:56:30.535 --> 00:56:33.918]  Hillary Clinton did not behave unethically while she was Secretary of State.
[00:56:34.338 --> 00:56:39.700]  Of course, we saw Rolling Stone really pump out that infamous rape story that turned out to be completely false.
[00:56:40.521 --> 00:56:42.822]  They pushed the swine flu, the H1N1.
[00:56:42.942 --> 00:56:53.546]  A lot of pregnant women, there was a record number of miscarriages from pregnant women taking this H1N1 experimental vaccine, but they were pushing that there's going to be this pandemic.
[00:56:53.906 --> 00:56:54.647]  You have to take it.
[00:56:54.687 --> 00:56:56.347]  Of course, they pushed that swine flu.
[00:56:56.687 --> 00:57:00.209]  And so a lot of people were taking this experimental vaccine for this pandemic.
[00:57:00.869 --> 00:57:01.749]  That never was.
[00:57:01.769 --> 00:57:06.031]  I mean, it's this is what their fake news is completely dangerous.
[00:57:06.371 --> 00:57:13.274]  And then we've got another article up there about Google actually removing the fake news about black people committing more crime.
[00:57:13.294 --> 00:57:20.577]  So they're now they're actually rewriting the statistics because people make this argument that it's racist for you to bring up black on black crime or whatever.
[00:57:21.017 --> 00:57:22.638]  When the fact is, if you don't
[00:57:23.278 --> 00:57:25.959]  Get to the bottom of it and do something about the statistics.
[00:57:26.439 --> 00:57:40.883]  Nothing is ever going to change with the way that police police those neighborhoods because, frankly, a police officer is 18 and a half times more likely to be killed by a black person than a cop is to kill an unarmed black person, much like what happened today.
[00:57:41.023 --> 00:57:45.764]  In fact, in in Georgia, an officer was shot dead and there's another one in critical condition.
[00:57:46.104 --> 00:57:48.786]  We're talking about Google removing crime stats.
[00:57:49.087 --> 00:57:49.287]  Right.
[00:57:49.527 --> 00:57:50.548]  Legitimate crime stats.
[00:57:50.648 --> 00:57:53.630]  Because they consider them to be racist and biased.
[00:57:53.931 --> 00:57:54.731]  Can you believe this?
[00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:55.672]  The madness that we're entering?
[00:57:56.053 --> 00:58:06.722]  Actual statistics that are factual, we can't view those because... And that's the thing, it doesn't feed into the narrative that they want to put out there that, you know, cops are just arbitrarily killing unarmed black men.
[00:58:07.173 --> 00:58:12.175]  So giving people, and I love a proactive message, we're running out of time here, so tackling the fake news.
[00:58:12.515 --> 00:58:23.640]  We heard Dinesh D'Souza say, and I believe he said it to Alex, that the only way to defeat the liberal, crappy, mainstream media lying left that own it is the emergence of social media.
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:24.781]  So tweet and retweet.
[00:58:25.121 --> 00:58:29.923]  I'm not a fan of Twitter anymore, but Gab, of course, as I understand it, get on social media and tweet and tweet.
[00:58:30.623 --> 00:58:33.665]  Spout out the truth as you see it, and we're fastly running out of time.
[00:58:34.106 --> 00:58:40.051]  Again, is there anything else you'd like to add to this other than, you know, giving a message of just people, get out there, mobilize.
[00:58:40.071 --> 00:58:42.733]  Fight back, I know it's exhausting, but fight back.
[00:58:42.813 --> 00:58:45.255]  We're winning and that's why they're scrambling.
[00:58:45.275 --> 00:58:47.337]  That's going to do it for us for tonight.
[00:58:47.397 --> 00:58:49.478]  Be sure, check us out tomorrow night.
[00:58:49.518 --> 00:58:50.619]  Are you hosting tomorrow night?
[00:58:50.699 --> 00:58:52.401]  I believe it's the lovely Leanne McAdoo.
[00:58:52.961 --> 00:58:53.662]  Nightly News.
[00:58:53.842 --> 00:58:55.904]  Also, hit the subscribe button on YouTube.
[00:58:55.924 --> 00:58:57.305]  That's going to do it for us.
