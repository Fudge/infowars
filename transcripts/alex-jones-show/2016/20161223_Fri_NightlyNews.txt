[00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:21.672]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.772 --> 00:00:24.453]  I'm David Knight and it is Friday, December 23rd, 2016.
[00:00:25.373 --> 00:00:27.414]  Now this is a pre-recorded show.
[00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:31.716]  We wanted to give the time to our reporters and our crew off to spend with their family.
[00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:33.377]  But we just wanted to say thank you.
[00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:34.758]  We've got some special treats for you.
[00:00:34.778 --> 00:00:36.059]  I'm going to tell you about that in just a moment.
[00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.961]  We wanted to say thank you for your support because that is the wind in our wings and the ground under our feet.
[00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:43.142]  We could not do this without you.
[00:00:43.582 --> 00:00:45.123]  So we hope that you have a Merry Christmas.
[00:00:45.143 --> 00:00:46.645]  We can say that now in Trump's America.
[00:00:46.945 --> 00:00:48.246]  We hope that you have a Merry Christmas.
[00:00:48.726 --> 00:00:56.533]  And we're going to have a debate coming up here between Owen Schroyer and an individual who is a progressive lefty, I guess we could describe him as.
[00:00:56.553 --> 00:00:58.915]  They're going to talk about the Electoral College and other differences.
[00:00:58.935 --> 00:01:02.217]  We're also going to have a rebroadcast of a special that I did.
[00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:07.540]  Three years ago, in 2013, it was the 100th anniversary of the Federal Reserve.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.324]  And remember, it was this time of year, when everybody was away, when everybody was partying, that they pulled that fraud off on us.
[00:01:14.684 --> 00:01:18.526]  So we combine that with, it's a wonderful life, and we call it, It's a Wonderful Lie.
[00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:19.607]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:01:20.047 --> 00:01:26.770]  And then we're going to have our crew talk about all of those shiny things that you get from China, as Donald Trump would say.
[00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.071]  So stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.953]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.

[00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:29.505]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:01.587 --> 00:03:13.383]  We are going to introduce the InfoWars Open Forum, where we're going to have a heated debate, or spirited discussion, with viewers like you, and hopefully, viewers with an opposing point of view.
[00:03:13.863 --> 00:03:16.006]  Now, first up, we've got Owen Schroyer.
[00:03:16.707 --> 00:03:18.488]  Versus Jerry Ford Jr.
[00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:21.210]  He's a progressive talk show host and Democrat.
[00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:50.531]  No one is allowed to have any articles.
[00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:51.752]  You can't be Googling.
[00:03:51.812 --> 00:03:53.134]  Nobody's on Twitter right now.
[00:03:53.154 --> 00:03:54.255]  Nobody's getting fed questions.
[00:03:54.675 --> 00:03:55.436]  Just casual.
[00:03:55.456 --> 00:04:02.563]  We're having a casual conversation and I am going to give you guys about a minute and a half to respond to the questions just for the sake of time.
[00:04:02.944 --> 00:04:04.305]  It's not going to be hardcore though.
[00:04:04.846 --> 00:04:05.566]  No buzzers around.
[00:04:06.247 --> 00:04:07.408]  So here we go.
[00:04:07.468 --> 00:04:08.389]  Let's go ahead and get started.
[00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:16.035]  And just to put it out there, make it fair, I guess, we're going to go ahead and let Jerry answer first.
[00:04:16.536 --> 00:04:17.116]  Mr. Ford.
[00:04:17.877 --> 00:04:19.438]  So you'll get the first question.
[00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.162]  Should we do away with the Electoral College and why?
[00:04:26.109 --> 00:04:27.651]  Well, I think that's an excellent question.
[00:04:27.691 --> 00:04:35.161]  I think right away, to look at this past election, a lot of Democrats were talking, Hey, look, Trump won the election.
[00:04:35.862 --> 00:04:41.350]  We knew the rules going in, but now we need to look at, I think both sides need to look at what are the rules and are the rules fair?
[00:04:42.171 --> 00:04:50.502]  I would say the rules and I would say that the system is set up against many people, and particularly it was set up kind of against Secretary Clinton.
[00:04:50.782 --> 00:04:59.194]  And the way when you look at Wyoming, a vote in Wyoming weighs a lot more than a vote in California or a vote in New York City.
[00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:06.828]  I think what we need to do is get away from a lot of people just creating history or just changing history.
[00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:15.172]  I mean, there's a lot of conversation specifically on the right that a lot of people are saying, hey, the reason for Electoral College is because
[00:05:16.473 --> 00:05:19.436]  The presidential candidates will have to go to every single state, which is true.
[00:05:19.796 --> 00:05:23.340]  But let's not act like that was the reason for the Electoral College.
[00:05:23.961 --> 00:05:29.167]  James Madison once said when the founders were trying to figure out, well, how do we elect the president?
[00:05:29.187 --> 00:05:34.433]  He said, well, the fittest way was for the people to elect the president, but
[00:05:35.214 --> 00:05:38.875]  The founders decided, hey, let's not do that because there's an issue here.
[00:05:39.175 --> 00:05:45.077]  Because if we have a direct democracy right here, the Southern states at the time would never have a president.
[00:05:45.477 --> 00:05:53.360]  And James Madison was famously saying that there would be no Virginian ever to be president if there was no type of electoral college.
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.561]  And the issue was exactly this.
[00:05:55.901 --> 00:05:58.041]  In the South, there was 40% to 50% of the South was
[00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:00.642]  Okay.
[00:06:00.863 --> 00:06:01.103]  Okay.
[00:06:20.971 --> 00:06:23.654]  The Electoral College is one of the lasting effects of slavery.
[00:06:24.335 --> 00:06:34.888]  So we need to look at that and find a new way to address the issue because it should never be a situation where three million more people voted for a candidate and a candidate still lost.
[00:06:34.928 --> 00:06:35.288]  All right.
[00:06:35.308 --> 00:06:36.189]  Thank you very much.
[00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:38.532]  And we'll get that, Mr. Schroyer, your response.
[00:06:38.652 --> 00:06:44.217]  Well, let me correct you because it wasn't 3 million, I think it ended up being 2.4 million, but these are just semantics.
[00:06:44.517 --> 00:06:54.345]  But, if you discount New York and California, if you discount those two states, Trump actually won the popular vote by 3 million votes.
[00:06:54.805 --> 00:06:58.008]  And to me, this is the reason why the Electoral College would set up
[00:06:58.388 --> 00:06:58.468]  So
[00:07:17.884 --> 00:07:18.425]  We're good to go.
[00:07:40.228 --> 00:07:41.089]  We're good
[00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:07.570]  Well, I don't know if it would have mattered if she could have done more.
[00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:14.592]  I just don't think that the inner cities or those voting populations that she relies on went to the polls to vote for Hillary Clinton this year.
[00:08:14.632 --> 00:08:18.773]  So I think that this is a year where the Electoral College shows why it exists.
[00:08:19.173 --> 00:08:22.834]  But, you know, more people are becoming politically active and looking into this.
[00:08:22.894 --> 00:08:26.315]  If this is something that they think is going to change, they're going to raise that issue.
[00:08:26.415 --> 00:08:30.636]  But to me, I think that this shows me at least why the Electoral College exists.
[00:08:30.856 --> 00:08:31.977]  Okay, thank you, Mr. Schroer.
[00:08:32.057 --> 00:08:37.783]  And so I kind of have a follow-up question to that where I think both of you are wanting to add a little bit more to it.
[00:08:37.823 --> 00:08:41.206]  A lot of people, there's a lot of discussion out there about the Electoral College.
[00:08:41.447 --> 00:08:44.229]  Hillary won the popular vote, we need to do away with it, and that's the question.
[00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:49.234]  Hillary won the popular vote, but that is irrelevant based on the way the U.S.
[00:08:49.274 --> 00:08:50.035]  elections are run.
[00:08:50.275 --> 00:08:51.817]  Why is this significant?
[00:08:51.957 --> 00:08:53.699]  Please explain, Mr. Ford Jr.
[00:08:55.572 --> 00:09:06.342]  Well, I think it's very significant because the only, you know, a couple of good points where you talked about the fact that the President of Canada has to travel across the country and talk to everybody.
[00:09:06.622 --> 00:09:09.285]  And I think that's one of the issues for the Clinton campaign this year.
[00:09:09.545 --> 00:09:11.127]  We didn't go to Wisconsin once.
[00:09:11.267 --> 00:09:12.468]  That's not an electoral college.
[00:09:13.028 --> 00:09:13.928]  We lost Pennsylvania.
[00:09:13.968 --> 00:09:19.850]  We lost the Rust Belt for a specific reason, which was we let the economic message.
[00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:30.373]  We need to get back to speaking about economics and speaking to rural America and suburban America about why the Democratic platform is the best platform for them to prosper.
[00:09:30.773 --> 00:09:31.893]  And that's the issue.
[00:09:32.834 --> 00:09:44.705]  But at the end of the day, I think there's other ways for us to elect the president other than the Electoral College, because as you stated earlier, hey, we don't want New York and California deciding our election.
[00:09:44.745 --> 00:09:50.270]  But let's not forget, these people who are voting in California and voting in New York, these are Americans.
[00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.793]  These are American people before they are Californians or New Yorkers.
[00:09:54.053 --> 00:09:56.876]  These are American people, so every vote should count the same.
[00:09:57.336 --> 00:10:01.782]  A vote in Wyoming shouldn't weigh a whole lot more than a vote in California.
[00:10:01.962 --> 00:10:03.364]  So we need to find out a new way.
[00:10:03.824 --> 00:10:16.660]  If it's putting a system together, because the point of Electoral College, one of the other reasons I didn't touch on, was because the founders didn't want a person who was extremely unqualified to be President of the United States.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:31.930]  So maybe you can put a mechanism in there where if the popular vote is to a point where the Congress doesn't believe that it is conducive to protecting our country, because this American system, we are very terrified of direct democracy for a reason.
[00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:39.975]  Maybe you put in a situation where you say, hey, if three-fourths of the House of Representatives agree, maybe you can overturn the rule of the popular vote or something of that nature.
[00:10:40.416 --> 00:10:46.680]  I don't know, but there has to be something other than this electoral college because the electoral college is outdated and is unnecessary.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:47.601]  Thank you.
[00:10:47.621 --> 00:10:48.701]  Mr. Shoyer.
[00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:57.067]  Well, I think that, you know, to talk about, he says, you know, you have to change your strategy, obviously, if you go by the popular vote instead of the electoral college.
[00:10:57.747 --> 00:11:04.151]  And he talks about how Hillary Clinton didn't go to certain cities and talk about why people need to vote for the Democrat Party.
[00:11:04.511 --> 00:11:06.973]  Well, I think the problem is they're sick of hearing it.
[00:11:07.073 --> 00:11:21.297]  They've heard it for 40, 50, 60 years now, and so people are tired of voting Democrat, and I think that that's why some of these inner cities or some of these areas that typically go blue, like Wisconsin, ended up going red in this election.
[00:11:21.717 --> 00:11:26.059]  But again, I think that this is more of an example as to why we need the Electoral College.
[00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:30.880]  Now, and as far as voter integrity is concerned, you talk about American citizens voting, you know,
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.041]  I understand your point, and I would agree to an extent.
[00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:53.509]  However, I do question the legitimacy of some of these votes where we know that we've had a president, and you might agree with this policy or where I disagree, we've had a president that has provided fast-track immigration and legalized a ton of people that end up voting Democrat because they view that as the party that got them to be an American citizen.
[00:11:53.529 --> 00:11:55.229]  So whether that's bad or good, you can have that debate.
[00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:56.210]  That's a separate platform.
[00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.070]  But that's
[00:12:17.245 --> 00:12:30.553]  Uh, that nobody's really done too deep of investigative research into, except we have found dead voters, we have found areas in Detroit and Michigan where more people ended up voting somehow when the electronic vote was counted than actually voted physically.
[00:12:30.893 --> 00:12:32.134]  So there is some question there.
[00:12:32.154 --> 00:12:39.418]  Uh, but I, I would still say that, um, this is why the Electoral College exists and I don't think that
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:49.903]  The 1.5 million people in New York and the 3 or 4 million people in California that voted for Clinton should determine the fate for 48 other states in the Union.
[00:12:50.143 --> 00:12:50.863]  Okay, thank you.
[00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:51.704]  Let's move on now.
[00:12:52.184 --> 00:12:58.106]  Prior to the presidential election, Donald Trump would not commit to honoring the results of November's election.
[00:12:58.186 --> 00:13:02.887]  Hillary Clinton slammed him for undermining the pillar of our democracy.
[00:13:03.547 --> 00:13:07.349]  Are Hillary and her supporters now just being a bunch of hypocrites?
[00:13:09.249 --> 00:13:15.331]  Well, I think that when they made those comments, they fully expected to be victorious.
[00:13:16.031 --> 00:13:22.574]  And they did not expect to have to face the backlash of the hypocrisy that turns out to be those comments.
[00:13:23.074 --> 00:13:29.636]  So, you know, my guess is they made something like that to try to demonize Trump, make him more ugly in the eye of the voter.
[00:13:29.996 --> 00:13:31.597]  And now the chickens have come home to roost.
[00:13:31.757 --> 00:13:32.337]  They lost.
[00:13:32.657 --> 00:13:32.737]  Yes.
[00:13:50.862 --> 00:13:53.084]  You know, they don't want to be in this position.
[00:13:53.864 --> 00:13:59.208]  I don't know if organically Democrats would have complained about Trump questioning the results of the election.
[00:13:59.268 --> 00:14:01.590]  Let's recall that Democrats have done that in the past before.
[00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:02.671]  Look at Al Gore.
[00:14:03.672 --> 00:14:08.936]  But Hillary put them in this position that now they're looking at themselves saying, oh, well, we were complaining about Trump.
[00:14:08.976 --> 00:14:11.478]  Now we're the ones complaining about Trump winning.
[00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:15.881]  So it's just a position that I don't know that they planned on being in.
[00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:17.442]  They certainly don't want to be here now.
[00:14:18.803 --> 00:14:19.664]  They are upset.
[00:14:19.724 --> 00:14:21.024]  They thought Hillary was going to win.
[00:14:21.085 --> 00:14:23.966]  They can't believe that Trump won and now they think there's Russian influence.
[00:14:24.206 --> 00:14:26.508]  So of course they're going to be upset and they want to take action.
[00:14:26.548 --> 00:14:34.473]  Unfortunately, I just think that there's a lot of false narratives and a lot of hearsay and the Hillary Clinton campaign set them up for this hypocrisy.
[00:14:34.994 --> 00:14:35.354]  Thank you.
[00:14:35.514 --> 00:14:39.238]  Mr. Ford, do you think Hillary Clinton... And the mainstream news, too, who said that she would win.
[00:14:39.258 --> 00:14:39.918]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:51.228]  Do you think Hillary Clinton and her supporters are, quote, undermining the pillar of our democracy like she claimed Donald Trump would be if he failed to accept the results of the election?
[00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:55.589]  Well, let me tell you, I think that's the first thing we're going to agree on right there, Owens.
[00:14:55.609 --> 00:15:02.233]  The mainstream media, a lot of Hillary supporters kind of, you know, feel lied to in a way because everybody believed that Hillary was going to win.
[00:15:02.494 --> 00:15:04.055]  No one saw what was going to happen in Wisconsin.
[00:15:04.075 --> 00:15:06.676]  Nobody saw Pennsylvania or Michigan happening.
[00:15:06.796 --> 00:15:08.237]  No pollsters saw it.
[00:15:09.198 --> 00:15:11.059]  So, you know, a lot of people was shocked.
[00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:14.921]  But at the end of the day, Owen, I can tell you this.
[00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:17.223]  There's not many Hillary supporters who's really out there.
[00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:19.664]  Uh, who's protesting and complaining.
[00:15:19.744 --> 00:15:21.685]  Those are a lot of Jill Stein supporters.
[00:15:22.006 --> 00:15:27.629]  A lot of Hillary supporters would say who, uh, really helped us a lot more if they would have just voted for Hillary in the first place.
[00:15:27.929 --> 00:15:38.315]  But I think what we saw in Electoral College vote, uh, where there was this push, uh, to get these faithless electors to change over from Trump to maybe a John Kasich or Trump to Hillary.
[00:15:38.655 --> 00:15:43.918]  We ended up seeing that, uh, there was electors in Washington who decided to vote for Bernie Sanders and not Hillary Clinton.
[00:15:44.238 --> 00:15:48.723]  So I think there's a bigger issue right now on the left that we have to figure out.
[00:15:48.984 --> 00:15:55.031]  A lot of Hillary supporters are really sitting back and really frustrated with a lot of different wings of the Democratic Party.
[00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:58.154]  So you've seen Jill Stein doing a lot of this.
[00:15:58.195 --> 00:16:04.342]  You've seen a lot of the far left doing a lot of this, who criticize Hillary harder than you guys criticize Hillary.
[00:16:04.642 --> 00:16:10.345]  And a lot of Hillary supporters are really upset at really President Obama and the way that the DNC was handled.
[00:16:10.906 --> 00:16:16.629]  Because the last eight years, you know, President Obama, it was his job to control the DNC.
[00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:22.053]  And we saw what happened in the Democratic primary, where the DNC really lost a lot of power.
[00:16:22.633 --> 00:16:26.875]  So a lot of Hillary supporters right now are trying to figure out, you know, what exactly went wrong?
[00:16:27.656 --> 00:16:29.277]  How can we not let this happen?
[00:16:29.877 --> 00:16:31.877]  Again, why were we in Arizona?
[00:16:32.137 --> 00:16:34.138]  Why didn't we ever go to Wisconsin?
[00:16:34.678 --> 00:16:36.038]  There's a lot of things that went wrong.
[00:16:36.978 --> 00:16:38.979]  But there's a fight right now on the left.
[00:16:39.019 --> 00:16:44.500]  And I think the only good thing about maybe a Donald Trump presidency is there's going to be a lot of soul searching going on.
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:53.301]  Because as we saw with the Electoral College, as we saw with the people who voted for Bernie Sanders in the Electoral College, there's bigger issues right now on the left that we have to handle.
[00:16:53.441 --> 00:16:55.182]  Or we might not see four years of Trump.
[00:16:55.202 --> 00:16:57.222]  There might be eight years of Trump if we don't come together.
[00:16:57.662 --> 00:16:58.062]  Thank you.
[00:16:58.182 --> 00:17:13.629]  And touching on that now, Chris Hayes, actually a news pundit, actually came out last night saying that Democrats must do everything possible to delegitimize Trump's presidency, no matter how deranged.
[00:17:14.149 --> 00:17:16.651]  That is the Democratic path back to power.
[00:17:17.051 --> 00:17:19.092]  Do you agree or disagree, Jerry?
[00:17:20.052 --> 00:17:21.212]  Well, here's the thing.
[00:17:21.953 --> 00:17:24.313]  The Republican Party did this with President Obama.
[00:17:24.833 --> 00:17:30.295]  And it worked with the Republican Party because, look, that's the conservative message is government doesn't work.
[00:17:30.615 --> 00:17:31.815]  Government is inefficient.
[00:17:31.855 --> 00:17:32.555]  It's ineffective.
[00:17:32.815 --> 00:17:44.118]  So after President Obama was elected to the president, see, a lot of the congressmen, a lot of people on the Hill met up together and said, we're going to do everything we can to stand against this president.
[00:17:44.538 --> 00:17:45.539]  We're going to shut down the government.
[00:17:45.559 --> 00:17:47.219]  We're going to be obstructionists.
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.361]  And that works for the conservative message when you are against government.
[00:17:50.621 --> 00:17:55.704]  For Democrats, that might not happen because look, we are saying government works for the people.
[00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:56.784]  Government is good.
[00:17:57.585 --> 00:17:59.285]  So it might not be a good strategy.
[00:17:59.305 --> 00:18:00.926]  So we might need to look at a different strategy.
[00:18:01.486 --> 00:18:04.368]  But here's the thing with Donald Trump, and we've seen this with Chuck Schumer.
[00:18:04.688 --> 00:18:08.590]  Trump is a lot closer to Chuck Schumer than he is to Mitch McConnell, in my opinion.
[00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:17.533]  I said this on the campaign trail that I believe that Donald Trump was a liberal from New York City who was really lying to a lot of people.
[00:18:17.854 --> 00:18:20.375]  And I think that we're seeing this with his cabinet picks.
[00:18:20.915 --> 00:18:22.455]  You've seen these globalist picks.
[00:18:22.475 --> 00:18:24.036]  You've seen Rick Perry, who's an energy.
[00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:25.917]  You've seen Goldman Sachs.
[00:18:26.017 --> 00:18:30.699]  How can you sit there and criticize Hillary Clinton for giving speeches to Goldman Sachs?
[00:18:31.019 --> 00:18:34.581]  And then hire the person that she was giving the speeches to into your cabinet.
[00:18:34.901 --> 00:18:47.669]  And then we had another Goldman Sachs person who's a part of Anthony, I forgot his last name, but he's part of the transition team who was talking to Chris Hayes and saying, hey, this is the last stand for globalism.
[00:18:48.069 --> 00:18:51.991]  And for me, I thought the Republican Party and a lot of conservatives was against this.
[00:18:52.332 --> 00:18:57.715]  So when Donald Trump's saying he's going to drain the swamp, I don't believe he's really going to do that because he really is the swamp.
[00:19:01.971 --> 00:19:16.407]  Three years ago, the Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act repealed the law that had been on the books for decades, barring the CIA and other agencies from engaging in domestic propaganda and disinformation.
[00:19:17.734 --> 00:19:36.355]  Over the weekend, they passed the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act that funds 160 plus million dollars to this new organization that will, quote, discover and counter with its own disinformation, alternative media that they dub fake news.
[00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:52.010]  At the very same time, we see mainstream media claiming that Trump, myself, Tucker Carlson, you name it, are Russian agents, and that the American people really wanted Hillary Clinton, but the Russians somehow hacked in, and that's why Trump won.
[00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:56.173]  Yes, we've gotten Trump elected, but they're openly trying to overthrow that.
[00:19:57.034 --> 00:20:00.379]  Now more than ever, InfoWars needs your prayers and your support.

[00:23:10.731 --> 00:23:18.595]  Over the last 100 years, the Federal Reserve has created bubbles and burst them, enslaved us with debt, and destroyed our purchasing power through inflation.
[00:23:19.485 --> 00:23:22.607]  Yes, it's been a wonderful lie for the bankers.
[00:23:23.248 --> 00:23:30.454]  There are striking parallels in Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life to the lies and tricks that real bankers use to create the Federal Reserve.
[00:23:30.934 --> 00:23:38.640]  Human nature doesn't change, and the greedy elite of 1913 and 2013 look and act a lot like Potter, the banker in the movie.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:46.822]  And many Americans are left like George Bailey, staring into the abyss as their dreams collapse and they face financial ruin.
[00:23:47.142 --> 00:23:50.343]  Do we live in a country that looks a lot more like Pottersville than Bedford Falls?
[00:23:50.743 --> 00:23:55.124]  What does Frank Capra's film show us about how we got here and how we can get out?
[00:23:55.885 --> 00:24:03.887]  When the Federal Reserve was created two days before Christmas a hundred years ago, it was a culmination of six years of fraud, fear, and manipulation.
[00:24:04.287 --> 00:24:07.408]  I've never really seen one, but that's got all the earmarks of being a run.
[00:24:08.723 --> 00:24:12.304]  The panic of 1907 was used to shape public support for the Fed.
[00:24:12.704 --> 00:24:17.725]  The panic was triggered by rumors that two major banks were about to become insolvent, just as we see in the movie.
[00:24:18.045 --> 00:24:22.186]  George, there is a rumor around town that you've closed your doors.
[00:24:22.266 --> 00:24:23.066]  Is that true?
[00:24:23.086 --> 00:24:26.847]  I am going all out to help in this crisis.
[00:24:27.687 --> 00:24:32.069]  I have just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs.
[00:24:32.889 --> 00:24:35.809]  They'll close up for a week and then reopen.
[00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:37.970]  Just took over the bank.
[00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:44.196]  I may lose a fortune, but I am willing to guarantee your people, too.
[00:24:44.796 --> 00:24:49.677]  Just tell them to bring their shares over here, and I will pay 50 cents on the dollar.
[00:24:49.977 --> 00:24:51.878]  Boy, you never miss a trick, do you, Potter?
[00:24:52.378 --> 00:24:53.538]  Unfortunately, J.P.
[00:24:53.578 --> 00:24:59.479]  Morgan got away with the deception, and was able to shut down competitors and snapped up assets at fire sale prices.
[00:24:59.759 --> 00:25:02.400]  Now, take during the Depression, for instance.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.461]  You and I were the only ones that kept our heads.
[00:25:06.161 --> 00:25:07.501]  You saved a billion long,
[00:25:08.547 --> 00:25:09.548]  I saved all the rest.
[00:25:10.208 --> 00:25:12.711]  Yes, well, most people say you stole all the rest.
[00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:14.872]  The envious ones say that, George.
[00:25:14.932 --> 00:25:15.773]  The suckers!
[00:25:16.053 --> 00:25:17.234]  Charles Lindbergh Sr.
[00:25:17.294 --> 00:25:25.301]  warned people at the time of the creation of the Federal Reserve that it would not stop boom and bust cycles, but would actually create them in order to benefit its private owners.
[00:25:25.661 --> 00:25:26.422]  Here's what he said.
[00:25:27.062 --> 00:25:31.586]  To cause high prices, all the Federal Reserve Board will do will be to lower the re-discount rate.
[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:35.061]  Producing an expansion of credit and a rising stock market.
[00:25:35.361 --> 00:25:41.484]  Then, when businessmen are adjusted to these conditions, it can check prosperity in mid-career by arbitrarily raising the rate of interest.
[00:25:41.824 --> 00:25:48.947]  It can cause a pendulum of a rising and falling market to swing gently back and forth, or cause violent fluctuations by greater rate variation.
[00:25:49.813 --> 00:25:57.195]  And in either case, it will possess inside information as to the financial conditions and advanced knowledge of the coming change, either up or down.
[00:25:57.975 --> 00:26:04.877]  This is the strangest, most dangerous advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privileged class by any government that ever existed.
[00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:11.559]  The system is private, conducted for the sole purpose of obtaining the greatest possible profits from the use of other people's money.
[00:26:11.939 --> 00:26:16.280]  They know in advance when to create panics to their advantage, and they know when to stop panic.
[00:26:17.188 --> 00:26:21.790]  Inflation and deflation work equally well for them when they control the finance.
[00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:26.752]  As we see in the movie, not all lending institutions have the same motivations.
[00:26:27.693 --> 00:26:30.474]  Now you take this loan here, Ernie Bishop.
[00:26:31.115 --> 00:26:36.758]  You know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi, you know?
[00:26:37.438 --> 00:26:40.680]  I happen to know the bank turned down this loan.
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:45.442]  But he comes here, and we're building him a house worth $5,000!
[00:26:46.143 --> 00:26:46.683]  Why?
[00:26:46.723 --> 00:26:50.305]  Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.
[00:26:50.605 --> 00:26:53.106]  You have all the papers there, his salary, insurance.
[00:26:53.186 --> 00:26:54.687]  I can personally vouch for his character.
[00:26:54.907 --> 00:26:55.508]  Friend of yours?
[00:26:55.808 --> 00:26:56.128]  Yes, sir.
[00:26:56.846 --> 00:26:57.166]  Uh-huh.
[00:26:57.607 --> 00:27:02.610]  You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money.
[00:27:03.831 --> 00:27:05.151]  What does that get us?
[00:27:05.512 --> 00:27:10.495]  A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class.
[00:27:10.915 --> 00:27:18.340]  As a former FDIC chair said, all too often the large banks use their models and their algorithms, and if you don't fit in their boxes, you don't get the loan.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:24.222]  And Dodd-Frank legislation is tying the hands of small lenders, shutting out buyers, and shutting down lenders.
[00:27:24.543 --> 00:27:28.684]  Today, there are fewer lenders than at any time the government has kept records.
[00:27:28.704 --> 00:27:31.586]  10,000 banks disappeared between 1984 and 2011.
[00:27:32.126 --> 00:27:38.469]  This town needs this measly one-horse institution, if only to have some place where people can come without crawling the potter.
[00:27:40.399 --> 00:27:46.561]  In the movie, George gets to see what happens to the small town if Potter didn't have competition from credit unions and smaller lenders.
[00:27:47.121 --> 00:27:51.123]  If it hadn't been for you... Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, everybody would be a lot better off.
[00:27:51.163 --> 00:27:56.344]  My wife and my kids and my friends and my... Look, little fellow, why don't you go off and haunt somebody else?
[00:27:56.584 --> 00:28:00.866]  Yeah, so you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier, eh?
[00:28:02.886 --> 00:28:03.747]  Well, I don't know.
[00:28:03.767 --> 00:28:04.567]  I guess you're right.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.122]  It's both been better if I'd never been born at all.
[00:28:09.442 --> 00:28:12.445]  Pottersville, the only businesses thriving, are vice.
[00:28:12.965 --> 00:28:13.666]  People are angry.
[00:28:14.166 --> 00:28:17.349]  The town is filled with signs like, keep moving, keep off the grass.
[00:28:18.069 --> 00:28:22.573]  Bert the cop actually shoots at George when he's running away, and is no threat to anyone.
[00:28:23.234 --> 00:28:28.618]  Stand back!
[00:28:29.339 --> 00:28:31.541]  Everyone is a renter, no one has a stake.
[00:28:32.245 --> 00:28:35.066]  Now, you're Arnie Bishop, and you live in Bailey Park with your wife and kids.
[00:28:35.166 --> 00:28:36.407]  Look, bud, what's the idea?
[00:28:36.507 --> 00:28:38.027]  I live in a shack in Pottersville.
[00:28:38.067 --> 00:28:41.949]  My wife ran away three years ago and took the kid, and I ain't never seen you before in my life, see?
[00:28:42.189 --> 00:28:46.630]  Private property and everyone having a stake is the antidote to Pottersville.
[00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:48.631]  Here, you're all businessmen here.
[00:28:48.691 --> 00:28:50.132]  Doesn't make them better citizens?
[00:28:50.172 --> 00:28:51.372]  Doesn't make them better customers?
[00:28:51.632 --> 00:28:58.215]  But whether it's the Trans-Pacific Partnership or a global carbon tax, the global elite don't see you as a stakeholder.
[00:28:58.435 --> 00:29:01.876]  They want to turn us all into serfs and treat us like cattle.
[00:29:02.236 --> 00:29:09.021]  Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about, they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community.
[00:29:09.681 --> 00:29:13.484]  Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath?
[00:29:14.145 --> 00:29:15.746]  Anyway, my father didn't think so.
[00:29:16.927 --> 00:29:21.370]  People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle.
[00:29:22.304 --> 00:29:24.565]  Well, in my book, he died a much richer man than you'll ever be.
[00:29:24.865 --> 00:29:26.426]  I'm not interested in your book.
[00:29:26.526 --> 00:29:29.047]  I'm talking about the building and loan.
[00:29:29.327 --> 00:29:31.027]  I know very well what you're talking about.
[00:29:31.048 --> 00:29:33.168]  You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on.
[00:29:33.609 --> 00:29:38.410]  Speaking of riches, do you find the salary amounts amusing when Potter tries to buy George off?
[00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:39.771]  Let's look at your side.
[00:29:41.512 --> 00:29:42.192]  Young man, 27, 28.
[00:29:42.252 --> 00:29:44.593]  Married, making, say, 40 a week.
[00:29:44.613 --> 00:29:44.593]  45. 45.
[00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:51.171]  Forty-five.
[00:29:51.651 --> 00:29:56.155]  George, I'll start you out at twenty thousand dollars a year.
[00:30:00.699 --> 00:30:03.122]  Twenty thousand dollars a year?
[00:30:03.842 --> 00:30:06.665]  You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town?
[00:30:07.225 --> 00:30:09.247]  Buying your wife a lot of fine clothes?
[00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:12.370]  A couple of business trips to New York a year?
[00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:14.252]  Maybe once in a while Europe?
[00:30:14.652 --> 00:30:16.013]  You wouldn't mind that, would you, Jones?
[00:30:16.293 --> 00:30:16.694]  Would I?
[00:30:17.486 --> 00:30:23.368]  Even if George had saved a lot of his $20,000 salary, would it have bought much a couple of decades later?
[00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:32.131]  By even the government's very conservative estimate of inflation, the dollar has lost 90% of its value since 1947, when the movie was made.
[00:30:32.511 --> 00:30:38.093]  The Fed's deliberate inflation is devastating to anyone trying to accumulate wealth through hard work and saving.
[00:30:38.693 --> 00:30:45.894]  So what is the answer to all the George Baileys out there a hundred years after the government gave control of our money supply to private bankers like Potter?
[00:30:46.235 --> 00:30:51.255]  Well, Potter had more money than he could spend, but would any of you want to be Potter?
[00:30:51.676 --> 00:30:56.456]  You sit around here and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money.
[00:30:56.496 --> 00:30:57.657]  Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter.
[00:30:57.677 --> 00:31:03.958]  In the whole vast configuration of things, I'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider.
[00:31:04.488 --> 00:31:11.253]  George Bailey finally sees how rich his own life is, as he sees the fruits of relationship, honesty, and compassion.
[00:31:11.514 --> 00:31:11.634]  Hey!
[00:31:12.254 --> 00:31:15.417]  Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!
[00:31:15.877 --> 00:31:17.258]  Happy New Year to you!
[00:31:17.718 --> 00:31:18.499]  In jail!
[00:31:18.639 --> 00:31:20.401]  Go on home, they're waiting for you!
[00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:29.091]  And if the public can awaken to the lies of the Federal Reserve, if it could even be audited... Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner!
[00:31:29.271 --> 00:31:32.512]  It would be a huge step to breaking the chains that enslave all of us.
[00:31:32.872 --> 00:31:36.593]  But ultimately, it is God that changes minds and changes hearts.
[00:31:36.973 --> 00:31:38.093]  God hates oppression.
[00:31:38.513 --> 00:31:42.113]  And we can, and should, confidently pray that he will stop it.
[00:31:42.994 --> 00:31:45.114]  I owe everything to George Bailey.
[00:31:46.054 --> 00:31:47.494]  Help him, dear father.
[00:31:48.415 --> 00:31:50.755]  Joseph, Jesus, and Mary,
[00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.552]  Help my friend, Mr. Bailey.
[00:31:54.552 --> 00:31:56.974]  Help my son, George, tonight.
[00:31:57.855 --> 00:31:59.556]  He never thinks about himself, God.
[00:31:59.576 --> 00:32:00.637]  That's why he's in trouble.
[00:32:01.518 --> 00:32:02.659]  George is a good guy.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.021]  Give him a break, God.
[00:32:06.162 --> 00:32:07.082]  I love him, dear Lord.
[00:32:07.583 --> 00:32:08.624]  Watch over him tonight.
[00:32:09.965 --> 00:32:10.785]  Please, God.
[00:32:11.206 --> 00:32:12.947]  Something's the matter with Daddy.
[00:32:12.967 --> 00:32:15.949]  Please bring Daddy back.
[00:32:15.989 --> 00:32:17.851]  Dear Father in heaven,
[00:32:22.199 --> 00:32:33.604]  I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there and you can hear me, show me the way.
[00:32:33.944 --> 00:32:38.947]  For the InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[00:33:02.486 --> 00:33:07.269]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[00:33:07.429 --> 00:33:14.474]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[00:33:14.734 --> 00:33:23.220]  I started to exercise really hard again, and I started to try to eat healthy, started taking third-party supplements, started seeing some more gains.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:34.051]  But when I started working with Dr. Grip and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that the population is absolutely deficient in.
[00:33:34.292 --> 00:33:34.632]  Boom!
[00:33:34.972 --> 00:33:38.416]  Weight started pouring off, toxins started coming out of my body.
[00:33:38.897 --> 00:33:40.038]  Then, by early 2016,
[00:33:42.091 --> 00:33:45.312]  I was in the best shape of my life since I'd been in really good shape in my twenties.
[00:33:45.432 --> 00:33:46.532]  But the election heated up.
[00:33:46.572 --> 00:33:48.953]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[00:33:49.073 --> 00:33:58.315]  But more importantly, I stopped taking the supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[00:33:58.535 --> 00:33:59.495]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[00:33:59.675 --> 00:34:03.356]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[00:34:04.156 --> 00:34:06.277]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again.
[00:34:07.018 --> 00:34:10.239]  And I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[00:34:10.279 --> 00:34:11.620]  It's a holiday, so I'll probably eat more.
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:15.262]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[00:34:15.482 --> 00:34:16.403]  It's December 5th, 2016.
[00:34:16.523 --> 00:34:20.365]  We're only like 25 days from 2017.
[00:34:21.086 --> 00:34:30.691]  And I want to invite all of the InfoWarriors of every race, color, and creed that bleed red blood and love liberty, justice, and truth to make our bodies great again.
[00:34:33.564 --> 00:34:38.567]  One of the most common questions I get is, you've changed the whole radio TV model.
[00:34:39.348 --> 00:34:40.088]  How did you do it?
[00:34:40.148 --> 00:34:43.030]  Did an ad agency teach you that or what book did you read?
[00:34:43.351 --> 00:34:44.892]  And the answer is, it was trial and error.
[00:34:45.172 --> 00:34:50.475]  I promote products that I personally use, like the Nutraceuticals and Infowarslife.com.
[00:34:50.956 --> 00:34:52.797]  And it's the same thing for this promotion.
[00:34:53.277 --> 00:34:54.598]  I didn't get this from an ad agency.
[00:34:54.658 --> 00:34:55.839]  I didn't just think this up.
[00:34:56.339 --> 00:35:03.204]  I was sitting there, I'd gained probably 10, 15 pounds because I'd gotten out of the habit of taking the supplements in the last few months with the election.
[00:35:03.964 --> 00:35:14.028]  And I was thinking, wow, I need to religiously take these, because I'm promoting these things, it's making me healthier, and if I'm not taking them, you know, I'm fatter, plus people aren't going to buy the product.
[00:35:14.509 --> 00:35:17.670]  So that's where the promotion comes from, is purely from reality.
[00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:24.853]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table, I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[00:35:25.173 --> 00:35:27.314]  I've lost five pounds.
[00:35:27.714 --> 00:35:28.475]  We're good to go.
[00:35:48.456 --> 00:35:51.598]  I mean, quite frankly, I eat more junk during the holidays like everybody else.
[00:35:52.018 --> 00:35:53.279]  So I'm eating worse.
[00:35:53.919 --> 00:36:01.283]  But because I've got these trace elements, or whatever it's doing in DNA Force and X2 and Supermail, I have lost 5 pounds.
[00:36:01.443 --> 00:36:01.984]  It's incredible.
[00:36:02.984 --> 00:36:04.905]  I thought I might lose 10 to 15 in a month.
[00:36:05.126 --> 00:36:06.406]  If this continues, it'll be 20.
[00:36:06.506 --> 00:36:08.928]  But generally, it's more dramatic up front.
[00:36:09.528 --> 00:36:10.409]  This is an experiment.
[00:36:10.509 --> 00:36:11.269]  Everybody's watching.
[00:36:11.509 --> 00:36:12.350]  We'll see what happens.
[00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:13.650]  This is Part 2.
[00:36:14.744 --> 00:36:15.705]  Next week, part three.
[00:36:16.465 --> 00:36:17.066]  That's a good point.
[00:36:17.706 --> 00:36:23.089]  Uh, we just cut there and Rob Deuce said, uh, Hey Alex, I know you don't follow script, but you might want to add to people.
[00:36:23.369 --> 00:36:26.992]  We're running some of the biggest specials of the year until December 17th.
[00:36:27.272 --> 00:36:33.016]  That's the last day that you can get your order in and have guaranteed shipping anywhere in the United States.
[00:36:33.196 --> 00:36:38.859]  And we have some of the biggest specials of the year, 50% off many of the nutraceuticals, the lowest discounts, 25%, 30% off X2.
[00:36:41.901 --> 00:36:46.044]  Huge discounts and free shipping storewide on every product.
[00:36:46.104 --> 00:36:46.985]  Thousands of items.
[00:36:47.425 --> 00:36:51.789]  And on top of that, if you sign up for AutoShip, an additional 10% off.
[00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:55.171]  And I'm going to do one more bad thing because I'm politically correct.
[00:36:55.712 --> 00:36:56.792]  Or I guess I'm politically incorrect.
[00:36:57.233 --> 00:36:59.274]  And that's to say Merry Christmas to everybody.
[00:36:59.595 --> 00:37:00.775]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:37:00.835 --> 00:37:01.416]  You're awesome.
[00:37:04.295 --> 00:37:13.222]  Well, we hope that you all are out there celebrating with your families, getting into the holiday spirit, and of course, you know, I'm sure that everyone's done a little bit of decorating this holiday season.
[00:37:13.803 --> 00:37:26.614]  Nothing says Christmas cheer, though, like Communist China and the fact that they are suppressing Christianity in their own country domestically while they are reaping massive profits from all of those Christmas exports.
[00:37:27.213 --> 00:37:28.213]  A lot of people don't think about that.
[00:37:28.253 --> 00:37:34.475]  They think you're just getting this innocent little Christmas bauble for your Christmas tree, or your Christmas lights for your house.
[00:37:35.095 --> 00:37:35.736]  Well, check this out.
[00:37:35.776 --> 00:37:43.538]  So the Chinese government has exported approximately 1.1 billion dollars in Christmas tree ornaments to the U.S.
[00:37:43.658 --> 00:37:46.099]  in just the first nine months of the year.
[00:37:46.499 --> 00:37:53.684]  So that's 92% of all the decorations imported by American firms, and that includes 87% of Christmas lights.
[00:37:53.704 --> 00:37:58.027]  So the Christmas lights throws millions more on top of that $1.1 billion.
[00:37:58.628 --> 00:38:09.896]  So these are large profits that the Chinese are raking in, but the ruling Communist Party routinely suppresses any Chinese citizens who practice Christianity.
[00:38:10.396 --> 00:38:24.291]  So here we are, giving billions of dollars to this oppressive, atheistic government of China who is now cracking down on anyone in their country who wants to practice Christianity, Falun Gong, spiritual movement, for instance, Buddhism.
[00:38:24.311 --> 00:38:25.693]  What do you guys think about that?
[00:38:26.328 --> 00:38:35.455]  Well, as you mentioned, the Communist Party in China has imposed severe restrictions on the Chinese Christians who want to travel abroad, whether it be for religious purposes.
[00:38:35.816 --> 00:38:40.159]  And they've also made it really hard on them to have churches inside of their homes.
[00:38:40.239 --> 00:38:49.827]  So these are, you know, communist tactics to try to, you know, keep Christians either in fear of being public about their religion or just from being Christian at all.
[00:38:50.447 --> 00:38:53.129]  And of course, that's the hypocrisy here out of China.
[00:38:53.229 --> 00:38:57.912]  They're going to massively profit off of this holiday, which is perfectly fine.
[00:38:58.232 --> 00:39:02.014]  But at the same time, they're going to try to suppress it domestically amongst their own civilians.
[00:39:02.054 --> 00:39:14.322]  So the Chai Koms need to either step up and completely ban Christmas, which of course we don't support that, or allow your citizens to celebrate Christmas just as you celebrate the massive profits you make from Christmas every year.
[00:39:14.502 --> 00:39:21.545]  Well, we're seeing kind of a crackdown on the celebration of Christmas decorations all over the West, though.
[00:39:21.665 --> 00:39:21.905]  We are.
[00:39:21.945 --> 00:39:23.626]  Don't you think, though, that it's up to us?
[00:39:23.846 --> 00:39:32.410]  And Trump actually talked about this in the campaign that, you know, our export policy, we're not exactly taxing them at the same rate that they're taxing us.
[00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:36.251]  We've agreed to accept these massive exports from China.
[00:39:36.331 --> 00:39:37.412]  And part of that's on us.
[00:39:37.492 --> 00:39:42.394]  But going back to the Christmas aspect of this, it's really difficult to find products that are made in America that are
[00:39:43.614 --> 00:39:47.076]  And they're able to do this because they're taking advantage of our tariff system, namely.
[00:39:47.096 --> 00:39:57.160]  I mean, the communistic aspect of who's producing this stuff, aside for a moment, it's up to us to sort of, you know, curb that with our own tariff policy.
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.902]  Not to mention, we're in a little bit of a crisis with China right now.
[00:40:00.962 --> 00:40:07.724]  It looks like they've captured one of our underwater military drones that we were using for research off the Chinese South China Sea.
[00:40:08.145 --> 00:40:08.905]  So it looks like
[00:40:09.659 --> 00:40:14.260]  I mean, we're kind of in a contagious place with China anyway, and we're moving towards that, I think.
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:18.661]  Well, and Donald Trump has not made any bones about how he feels about that.
[00:40:18.741 --> 00:40:26.463]  He's tweeted, you know, we've all seen his tweets, you know, did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency, making it hard for our companies to compete.
[00:40:26.523 --> 00:40:28.864]  They tax our products heavily going into their country.
[00:40:29.344 --> 00:40:34.305]  And so he has, you know, really not held back how he wants to redo this one China policy.
[00:40:34.325 --> 00:40:36.866]  And I thought it was really funny.
[00:40:37.146 --> 00:40:38.106]  You brought up the drone.
[00:40:38.886 --> 00:40:40.747]  And so he says, you know what?
[00:40:40.807 --> 00:40:41.588]  We don't want the drone.
[00:40:41.608 --> 00:40:42.228]  They can keep it.
[00:40:42.268 --> 00:40:44.009]  We don't care because what are they going to do?
[00:40:44.049 --> 00:40:46.070]  They're going to want it back with conditions.
[00:40:46.651 --> 00:40:50.973]  And so, you know, everyone was like, well, he is inflaming U.S.-China relations.
[00:40:51.053 --> 00:40:54.675]  ThinkProgress has this article out about this is bad news.
[00:40:55.256 --> 00:40:58.418]  And so they're talking about how he is inflaming these U.S.-China relations.
[00:40:58.838 --> 00:41:00.239]  The drone thing is just the latest.
[00:41:00.259 --> 00:41:04.101]  Of course, we have that phone call to the president of Taiwan.
[00:41:04.621 --> 00:41:07.143]  So here, listen to this ThinkProgress article.
[00:41:07.483 --> 00:41:07.643]  I think?
[00:41:20.123 --> 00:41:37.768]  When he took that phone call from the President of Taiwan, it was like, oh my gosh, nuclear war, totally going against diplomatic norms, when the day before, no one knew what the protocol was for talking to Taiwan, you know, the President of Taiwan from the President-elect, but then all of a sudden, they're experts on it, we're going to, you know, starting World War III with China.
[00:41:38.248 --> 00:41:43.730]  So, anything he does is basically, you know, going to be ramping up the tensions with our nuclear
[00:41:45.244 --> 00:42:02.116]  Well, let's keep in mind that China is basically building land masses in the South China Sea right now, which is a heavily contested area, and essentially putting military bases there, something that's upsetting other regional powers in the South China Sea, so they're kind of being aggressors there too.
[00:42:02.516 --> 00:42:08.060]  But just to get back to the economical aspect and the Christmas and the product aspect of this, you know,
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:17.824]  This can kind of serve as an example of how not just over Christmas, but all products that Americans are buying are massively produced in China.
[00:42:18.204 --> 00:42:26.408]  And Donald Trump has started to shed some light on how that goes on, the devaluation of currency, the unfair trade deals, why companies want to move there for their manufacturing.
[00:42:26.708 --> 00:42:33.131]  And we can talk about the tariffs and this, that, or the other thing, but really Americans have the power to take this back.
[00:42:33.511 --> 00:42:35.812]  Americans can decide, you know what, I'm going to look.
[00:42:37.152 --> 00:42:43.474]  I'm going to look at these products and if it says made in China, well maybe I'm going to look for something that says made in America instead.
[00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:45.014]  And that's how we can bring commerce back.
[00:42:45.214 --> 00:42:48.075]  Of course, Trump talks about actually bringing the manufacturing back too.
[00:42:48.335 --> 00:42:59.177]  So you could kind of have a double-edged sword attack at this, where Americans look to buy American, but also Donald Trump looks to implement fair tax deals, fair tariff deals, and bring the manufacturing back.
[00:42:59.694 --> 00:43:03.799]  I love that the mainstream media is crying out feverishly because he's showing strength.
[00:43:03.859 --> 00:43:05.662]  Look, he tweeted to them, go ahead, keep the drone.
[00:43:05.682 --> 00:43:06.543]  We don't even want it back.
[00:43:06.563 --> 00:43:07.264]  Go ahead and keep it.
[00:43:07.284 --> 00:43:08.285]  We're not negotiating with you.
[00:43:08.305 --> 00:43:09.646]  That's Obama's drone.
[00:43:09.907 --> 00:43:10.347]  Exactly.
[00:43:10.708 --> 00:43:18.057]  Do you remember the President Obama landing in China and the issue with the tarmac where they wouldn't even roll down the stairs?
[00:43:18.337 --> 00:43:18.817]  Exactly.
[00:43:18.837 --> 00:43:19.938]  They wouldn't even give him stares.
[00:43:19.978 --> 00:43:25.260]  So they clearly don't respect us, respect our leadership, and it's time to be in a position of strength.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.301]  It's really encouraging.
[00:43:26.701 --> 00:43:33.644]  And hopefully, well, can you imagine right now, Hillary Clinton, we're assuming office, the TPP, the trade deals that we would see coming out with it.
[00:43:33.704 --> 00:43:36.646]  They already own so much of our debt to begin with.
[00:43:37.066 --> 00:43:41.248]  I mean, we would have a stamp on it saying made in China before it's all over with.
[00:43:41.308 --> 00:43:43.629]  I mean, I think this is a really good thing, this projection of strength.
[00:43:43.849 --> 00:43:44.269]  Exactly.
[00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:46.331]  They do respect that power.
[00:43:47.192 --> 00:43:55.519]  Going back to this one China policy, that basically establishes that countries seeking diplomatic relations with China must sever ties with Taiwan and vice versa.
[00:43:55.659 --> 00:43:58.661]  Decades old agreement reached by Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong in 1972.
[00:44:00.863 --> 00:44:09.690]  So they're saying, you know, look, this is allowed for the endurance of relations between the superpowers and how dare you, you know, thwart these come between these relations.
[00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:11.171]  But that's what we're talking about.
[00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:14.894]  Voting with our dollars and being able to say, you know what, this isn't this is an issue.
[00:44:15.194 --> 00:44:16.996]  We don't want these bad trade deals.
[00:44:17.156 --> 00:44:27.584]  And frankly, the fact that we are being forced to buy all of this cheap crap from China, we are using our dollars to prop up this regime that, you know, is
[00:44:30.183 --> 00:44:49.348]  Going against practitioners of a spiritual faith that they disagree with, the Falun Gong spiritual movement, this is a, you know, they've been in prison, they've been tortured, they've been into forced labor camps, and many people are reporting that they're actually forcibly having their organs harvested for, you know, people going in to get organ tourism.
[00:44:50.948 --> 00:44:52.229]  They have organs on demand.
[00:44:52.589 --> 00:44:53.730]  And where do they come from?
[00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:59.133]  You know, people are on waiting lists for years here to try to get an organ, but you can go there, organs on demand.
[00:44:59.173 --> 00:45:05.036]  So, you know, this is something that we are supporting by going to these big box stores and buying all this cheap crap.
[00:45:05.416 --> 00:45:13.681]  When, frankly, everyone, you know, that I know, my family included, you know, they buy their stuff and then they go and they donate it to Goodwill when they're done.
[00:45:14.241 --> 00:45:18.064]  For every holiday, you can frankly go to Goodwill and find some recycled stuff.
[00:45:18.084 --> 00:45:23.129]  You don't have to continually support these oppressive regimes that are profiting.
[00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:35.280]  Well, and again, this is the kind of story that I think can really hit home with some people because, you know, how many people out there every year go out and buy new Christmas ornaments or new Christmas lights or the latest Christmas decorations?
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:38.602]  Okay, well, now they look at the thing and they say, oh, made in China?
[00:45:38.662 --> 00:45:38.923]  You know what?
[00:45:38.943 --> 00:45:40.064]  Maybe this year I'll lay off.
[00:45:40.664 --> 00:45:42.906]  Uh, maybe this year I'll try to find something made in America.
[00:45:42.967 --> 00:45:52.836]  This is the kind of story that if people really sink their teeth into, I think can make a conscious effort, uh, basically not to give all of China the Christmas commerce that comes in.
[00:45:53.136 --> 00:45:58.301]  Everybody knows Christmas is, you know, one of the most profitable, if not the most profitable holidays going.
[00:45:58.622 --> 00:46:00.704]  If they understood that that profit was going to China,
[00:46:01.084 --> 00:46:05.005]  They might be more conscious in their purchasing power or where they're spending that money.
[00:46:05.345 --> 00:46:07.746]  I mean, we were talking about this before we came on the set.
[00:46:07.806 --> 00:46:12.727]  You were kind of, you were talking about giving me a hard time, like, oh, well, where'd you buy your Christmas decorations, Owen?
[00:46:12.947 --> 00:46:14.147]  Where'd you get your Christmas gifts?
[00:46:14.407 --> 00:46:15.888]  But it's something people really need to think about.
[00:46:15.928 --> 00:46:20.629]  I mean, this is how you can strengthen the American economy without even the president's help.
[00:46:20.769 --> 00:46:24.970]  Withdraw your funds going to China and Chinese products and try to buy American.
[00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:33.375]  Well, and that was the big issue with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and that we were kind of making deals with countries that still practice enslaved labor.
[00:46:33.395 --> 00:46:36.396]  That have serious humanitarian issues, like China.
[00:46:36.616 --> 00:46:39.118]  I mean, that's just one of them, Leigh-Anne.
[00:46:39.178 --> 00:46:41.779]  But touching back on this Oregon, I know we're running out of time.
[00:46:41.839 --> 00:46:50.804]  The Oregon situation, if you think about this for a moment, we're dealing with a country that takes organs from political dissidents, from political prisoners, and sells them for profit.
[00:46:50.864 --> 00:46:52.625]  Maybe it's time to stop doing business with them.
[00:46:52.906 --> 00:46:53.466]  Absolutely.
[00:46:53.726 --> 00:46:55.554]  Well, think about it before you buy.
[00:47:03.021 --> 00:47:11.162]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.143 --> 00:47:20.964]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.364 --> 00:47:25.205]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.285 --> 00:47:28.306]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.726 --> 00:47:29.806]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin, on the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.868 --> 00:47:43.989]  It says, deport Soros on the bottom, and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:52.551]  So, it is a limited edition, deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.911 --> 00:47:53.471]  It's powerful.

[00:48:59.622 --> 00:49:02.302]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:04.323 --> 00:49:10.485]  Mr. Schroyer, do you agree that Democrats must do everything they can to delegitimize the presidency of Donald Trump?
[00:49:11.035 --> 00:49:12.277]  Well, I'll just say this first.
[00:49:12.577 --> 00:49:19.928]  I'd like to give Donald Trump, you know, a hundred days or a year in office before I consider him the swamp or his appointments the swamp.
[00:49:20.689 --> 00:49:27.298]  But as far as what Chris Hayes said, you know, I think that what Jerry said in his last answer and then in this one actually makes sense to me.
[00:49:27.839 --> 00:49:34.505]  Talking about the Democrats needing to do some soul-searching, but then Chris Hayes saying that you need to do everything to delegitimize Trump.
[00:49:34.905 --> 00:49:37.927]  You know, the Democrats actually had something with Bernie Sanders.
[00:49:38.428 --> 00:49:41.751]  And I'm not particularly a fan of Bernie Sanders.
[00:49:41.851 --> 00:49:46.394]  I've actually agreed with a lot of the things that he's said in some of his speeches in front of Congress and the Senate before.
[00:49:46.995 --> 00:49:49.057]  But the Democrats had something with Bernie Sanders.
[00:49:49.097 --> 00:49:51.699]  Now, they got totally railroaded with Hillary Clinton.
[00:49:52.319 --> 00:49:53.000]  I don't think so.
[00:50:13.192 --> 00:50:13.712]  We're good to go.
[00:50:29.299 --> 00:50:32.180]  Hillary Clinton was involved and she just railroaded the whole thing.
[00:50:32.241 --> 00:50:44.806]  So instead of Democrats worrying about Donald Trump right now, I think that they need to stop trying to attack Trump, stop trying to delegitimize Trump, because that's only going to hurt them, I think, in the long run.
[00:50:45.147 --> 00:50:47.588]  I think if they come, if they give Trump a chance,
[00:50:48.408 --> 00:50:49.109]  Leave him alone.
[00:50:49.289 --> 00:50:52.972]  Let him, essentially, if you think he's that bad, let himself destruct and then come in.
[00:50:53.313 --> 00:50:55.935]  But just come back, say, you know what, we had something in Bernie Sanders.
[00:50:56.175 --> 00:50:57.757]  Let's try to find that momentum again.
[00:50:57.797 --> 00:51:01.841]  Let's try to move forward with that momentum and really just put Hillary Clinton behind us.
[00:51:01.881 --> 00:51:06.865]  I mean, she, the Democratic Party, needs to bury Hillary Clinton if they want to have a future.
[00:51:06.905 --> 00:51:07.486]  That's how I feel.
[00:51:07.506 --> 00:51:08.227]  Thank you.
[00:51:09.252 --> 00:51:10.173]  Okay, so the next question.
[00:51:10.253 --> 00:51:13.995]  Donald Trump was chastised for expressing concern over a rigged election.
[00:51:14.175 --> 00:51:23.520]  President Obama scoffed at the notion, however now claims that the Russians interfered in our elections by leaking these DNC emails without providing any specific evidence.
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:32.885]  Why should people be more concerned with the leaker rather than the contents of the emails which reveal that the DNC actually rigged the primary?
[00:51:33.586 --> 00:51:34.026]  Mr. Ford?
[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:37.881]  Well, that answer is simple because it's Russia.
[00:51:38.261 --> 00:51:41.283]  Russia is undermining our democracy.
[00:51:41.523 --> 00:51:42.883]  Look, the election is over.
[00:51:42.903 --> 00:51:43.424]  I understand.
[00:51:43.684 --> 00:51:47.265]  So I'm not going to try to say this is why Hillary lost or not.
[00:51:47.305 --> 00:51:53.188]  But at the end of the day, you have a foreign government who is trying to, who basically did change the election.
[00:51:53.608 --> 00:52:09.663]  In my opinion, because it was very strategic how they were releasing these different emails and you know, release a batch of emails before the DNC convention that set off a lot of dominoes that Debbie Wasserman Soar got fired and
[00:52:10.483 --> 00:52:12.866]  It was a lot of things that took place.
[00:52:13.186 --> 00:52:20.412]  But the fact of the matter is that Vladimir Putin sat there and he actually helped Donald Trump become president.
[00:52:20.472 --> 00:52:27.419]  And what I'm afraid of is other countries seeing this as a possibility and, hey, why wouldn't China do this?
[00:52:27.739 --> 00:52:30.501]  Or why wouldn't other countries do this if they see this in their interest?
[00:52:30.622 --> 00:52:37.788]  I understand that if this is your guy and if, you know, the enemy of your enemy might be your friend, but now we're all Americans.
[00:52:37.808 --> 00:52:40.970]  We have to take a step back and say, hey, this could happen to me as a Republican.
[00:52:41.471 --> 00:52:45.954]  And we need to take a stand against this because Vladimir Putin is not a great guy.
[00:52:46.195 --> 00:52:51.219]  He's not a guy that we should be standing there and hugging with, in my opinion.
[00:52:51.559 --> 00:52:52.960]  I think we need to stand up to him.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:58.864]  We need Donald Trump or a stronger leader to stand up against Vladimir Putin and not hug Vladimir Putin.
[00:52:59.765 --> 00:53:06.050]  And I think that's going to be what, you know, we're looking for in a leader these next couple of years.
[00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:08.451]  Well, I would just ask you this, Jerry.
[00:53:08.572 --> 00:53:11.914]  What is your most compelling evidence?
[00:53:12.054 --> 00:53:17.118]  What has convinced you that it was Russia that hacked the DNC and leaked the emails?
[00:53:19.761 --> 00:53:23.123]  Well, I mean, it was clear that it was Russia.
[00:53:23.324 --> 00:53:31.649]  When the CIA came out and said that they are sure that it was Russia and the FBI came and said, yeah, this is also Russia.
[00:53:31.669 --> 00:53:40.135]  I would take the side of our patriots who's working in our intelligence, our Americans who work in the CIA and the FBI.
[00:53:40.536 --> 00:53:47.661]  I was very disappointed in the president-elect who decided to throw his own Americans under the bus to defend a foreign country.
[00:53:50.302 --> 00:53:52.302]  Sorry, I'm the moderator here, Mr. Schroyer.
[00:53:52.382 --> 00:54:02.164]  I know it's very tempting for you to get in, but I will just say there isn't any significant evidence and there are actually some infighting within these 17 intelligence agencies.
[00:54:02.204 --> 00:54:06.405]  They have yet to provide the actual evidence that proves this.
[00:54:07.826 --> 00:54:13.007]  So, my question again, why should people not be concerned about the contents of the emails?
[00:54:14.087 --> 00:54:20.833]  Well, but hold on a second here because let's just say, but let's just say it, but okay, well, I don't know what they can release to prove this.
[00:54:21.013 --> 00:54:21.253]  All right.
[00:54:21.454 --> 00:54:22.134]  Here's my problem.
[00:54:22.154 --> 00:54:22.294]  Okay.
[00:54:22.314 --> 00:54:23.075]  So what are you going to release?
[00:54:23.095 --> 00:54:27.919]  I guess they'll have to release some document that shows these, these computers were hacked or whatever.
[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:29.220]  Um, but.
[00:54:29.881 --> 00:54:34.823]  But my problem is, why would you take these bureaucracies at their word?
[00:54:34.843 --> 00:54:38.885]  These are the same people that led us into war with Iraq based on false intelligence.
[00:54:39.005 --> 00:54:40.505]  Which I think Jerry would agree with that.
[00:54:40.566 --> 00:54:47.749]  So my problem with this is, I don't take what these bureaucracies are saying at face value.
[00:54:47.809 --> 00:54:50.570]  I always take that with a grain of salt and I like to find out for myself.
[00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:55.752]  WikiLeaks has completely denied that there was any Russian involvement in this and I'll
[00:54:56.032 --> 00:54:57.153]  I'll take that as your response to the question.
[00:54:57.173 --> 00:55:00.395]  Mr. Ford, are you comfortable with saying that the issue is Putin rather than the fact that
[00:55:26.513 --> 00:55:26.613]  Woah!
[00:55:26.654 --> 00:55:26.754]  What?
[00:55:30.846 --> 00:55:33.607]  I think the content is problematic.
[00:55:34.728 --> 00:55:36.109]  But let's have an investigation.
[00:55:36.609 --> 00:55:37.549]  Why not have an investigation?
[00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:39.230]  Because Owen, I kind of agree with you.
[00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:50.836]  You know, you have to take it on face value, but let's have an investigation and let's see if there is any proof that Russia, you know, was involved in the election who tried to put Donald Trump into office.
[00:55:50.856 --> 00:55:53.537]  So let's have a sit down and have an investigation.
[00:55:53.597 --> 00:55:57.479]  But here's my problem with the content of these emails.
[00:55:58.359 --> 00:55:59.100]  I'm pretty sure if
[00:56:00.416 --> 00:56:04.760]  The RNC was hacked early in the election when Donald Trump just announced he was president.
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:08.503]  I don't think that the RNC was fully behind Donald Trump.
[00:56:08.643 --> 00:56:13.047]  I'm pretty sure there was people in the Republican Party who were saying some negative things about Donald Trump.
[00:56:13.287 --> 00:56:18.172]  Just how Mitt Romney came out in the early part of the year, who went after Donald Trump.
[00:56:18.232 --> 00:56:20.474]  I'm pretty sure that there were some people who was against Donald Trump.
[00:56:20.974 --> 00:56:23.636]  The establishment was not for Donald Trump.
[00:56:23.656 --> 00:56:25.278]  The establishment was not for Bernie Sanders.
[00:56:25.898 --> 00:56:27.379]  So this is not new.
[00:56:27.559 --> 00:56:40.669]  I mean, I don't think anybody really believed that the DNC or Democratic Party was going to be behind a guy who was an independent, who just caucuses with the Democratic Party and who was attempting to primary the president, a sitting president in 2012.
[00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:47.396]  I mean, I don't think anybody really believed that, you know, that DNC was going to be fair.
[00:56:47.476 --> 00:56:50.119]  And RNC really, you know, they have their favorite also.
[00:56:50.219 --> 00:56:52.922]  You know, Jeb Bush was their favorite coming out of the gate.
[00:56:53.683 --> 00:56:56.566]  But I think the question is, what action did they take?
[00:56:56.886 --> 00:57:07.328]  So when you look at how the debate schedule was set up with the DNC, that's where you get into, you know, being kind of problematic where Debbie Washington Shorts was trying to help Hillary Clinton.
[00:57:07.408 --> 00:57:17.610]  I think in the long run she hurt Hillary because talking to a lot of grassroots, Democratic activists in the civic clubs, you know, Hillary didn't need help from Debbie Washington Shorts.
[00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:22.431]  She really helped push Bernie Sanders because she made Hillary look even more guilty
[00:57:22.911 --> 00:57:25.473]  Or even more corrupt by helping her out.
[00:57:26.073 --> 00:57:29.496]  So, you know, I'm glad that we're moving on to a new DNC chair.
[00:57:29.896 --> 00:57:31.297]  And I think that's one of the issues.
[00:57:31.337 --> 00:57:33.759]  That's why I criticized President Obama, because that's his job.
[00:57:33.819 --> 00:57:36.661]  He should have been there and took control of that DNC.
[00:57:37.281 --> 00:57:39.983]  And it hurt Hillary and it hurt the Democratic Party.
[00:57:40.043 --> 00:57:41.024]  And now we're suffering for it.
[00:57:41.184 --> 00:57:41.484]  I don't
[00:57:56.678 --> 00:57:57.979]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:57:58.059 --> 00:57:58.459]  I don't know.
[00:57:58.599 --> 00:58:03.062]  The FBI, the CIA, do they really investigate these things in a fair manner?
[00:58:03.102 --> 00:58:04.403]  Do they investigate what the people want?
[00:58:04.483 --> 00:58:04.763]  I don't know.
[00:58:04.783 --> 00:58:06.224]  I'm just adding that caveat out there.
[00:58:07.445 --> 00:58:08.346]  We may never know.
[00:58:08.366 --> 00:58:09.326]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:58:09.626 --> 00:58:11.508]  But that's what Hillary Clinton tells her donors.
[00:58:11.568 --> 00:58:12.128]  It was Russia.
[00:58:12.228 --> 00:58:13.589]  It was James Comey and the FBI.
[00:58:13.669 --> 00:58:25.837]  It was not the fact that she... I don't think the Russians convinced her to set up her own private server in her home to avoid the FOIA requests and to not have permission to store these government documents.
[00:58:26.497 --> 00:58:28.078]  On her private server in her bathroom.
[00:58:28.219 --> 00:58:29.119]  So there's that.
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:30.360]  Hillary is gone.
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:30.741]  Ding dong.
[00:58:30.761 --> 00:58:31.281]  The witch is dead.
[00:58:31.861 --> 00:58:32.122]  All right.
[00:58:32.222 --> 00:58:36.085]  Thank you guys so much for joining us for the first InfoWars Open Forum.
[00:58:36.145 --> 00:58:48.415]  And if anybody out there wants to be the next up at bat with Owen Schroyer or whoever else here on the panel, just talk about these things that are kind of trending on Twitter that people are discussing rather than just fighting.
[00:58:48.755 --> 00:58:51.918]  Let's see if we can have a discussion and actually agree on some things.
[00:58:51.978 --> 00:58:52.939]  I think we did find
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:56.526]  Some pretty enlightening points of view from both perspectives here today.
[00:58:56.546 --> 00:59:02.238]  So Jerry Ford Jr., thank you so much for joining the show and Mr. Schroyer, and we will see you guys soon.
[00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:09.934]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.395 --> 00:59:20.122]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.442 --> 00:59:24.145]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.725 --> 00:59:29.386]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.786 --> 00:59:36.007]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.308 --> 00:59:38.608]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:39.268 --> 00:59:41.709]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
