[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]  [Music]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  [Music]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000]  [Music]
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000]  [Music]
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000]  [Music]
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000]  [Music]
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.679]  [Music]
[00:01:03.684 --> 00:01:19.051]  I want to thank you all.
[00:01:21.132 --> 00:01:25.374]  I'll tell you, I just got off the radio.
[00:01:25.434 --> 00:01:28.455]  I went off a little bit late, about a couple minutes after 10 o'clock.
[00:01:28.515 --> 00:01:30.596]  I'm from Far North Astronauts and North Research.
[00:01:31.963 --> 00:01:34.744]  Boogied down here, and uh, what camera am I pointing at?
[00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:37.685]  I just slid into the chair about 10 seconds before it put me on the air.
[00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:40.346]  Alright, we are live!
[00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:41.687]  We are ready to go!
[00:01:41.707 --> 00:01:49.610]  Let me straighten my newspapers up here for the Time Warner Access Television viewing audience.
[00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.472]  Of course, my name is Alex Jones, and this is the new show, InfoWars!
[00:01:56.272 --> 00:01:58.573]  Back there in the control room are a lot of great people.
[00:01:59.574 --> 00:02:00.474]  A lot to talk about.
[00:02:01.997 --> 00:02:03.038]  Did I lose my paperclip?
[00:02:03.058 --> 00:02:03.638]  Of course I did.
[00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:05.799]  Little bastard.
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.243]  We're going to talk about the Marines in Oakland and Alameda.
[00:02:11.903 --> 00:02:13.324]  March 15th through 21st.
[00:02:15.806 --> 00:02:24.251]  And we have their mascot here, the Sea Dragon, rising out of the ocean with the little helicopters to keep everybody safe.
[00:02:24.532 --> 00:02:25.592]  And the mock gun.
[00:02:29.054 --> 00:02:29.675]  Fun stuff.
[00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:34.478]  We have a new study out.
[00:02:34.498 --> 00:02:37.658]  The other studies that were against this didn't get much attention.
[00:02:37.678 --> 00:02:41.939]  Of course, this is front page in a lot of the newspapers, and it'll be front page in a lot of the other papers tomorrow.
[00:02:42.778 --> 00:02:50.778]  And of course it is March 1st, 1999, and we're getting ready, me and Mike, to go out of town
[00:02:50.778 --> 00:02:57.778]  the 15th through the 16th, 17th, maybe even the 18th, in California to show the biggest
[00:02:57.778 --> 00:03:04.058]  mock gun confiscation and anti-terrorist training with the Marines and Army Social Operations
[00:03:04.058 --> 00:03:05.818]  Warfare Command in a joint exercise.
[00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:11.818]  And I have the information right here, right off their website for you, if you'd like to
[00:03:11.818 --> 00:03:12.818]  check out their website.
[00:03:12.818 --> 00:03:18.818]  In fact, I should give you all one of these pieces of paper at the site, and one of you
[00:03:18.818 --> 00:03:19.818]  all...
[00:03:19.818 --> 00:03:23.658]  My color printer is broken, I got stuck with a black and white one.
[00:03:23.658 --> 00:03:24.658]  So one of you guys...
[00:03:24.658 --> 00:03:28.139]  These are all the pages I have to use here.
[00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.459]  I'll tell you what.
[00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:34.045]  Anybody want to go to the exact site?
[00:03:34.205 --> 00:03:34.865]  It's a long one.
[00:03:34.885 --> 00:03:35.606]  It's a government site.
[00:03:35.626 --> 00:03:36.347]  I'm not going to type that in.
[00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:37.427]  They want to see the operation.
[00:03:37.888 --> 00:03:38.468]  All the love.
[00:03:38.528 --> 00:03:40.810]  I'll tell you how loving it is a lot in there.
[00:03:42.351 --> 00:03:43.332]  The other activities.
[00:03:43.452 --> 00:03:54.140]  Of course, the black helicopters have been attacking the South Texas coast in Operation Last Dance from Army Special Operations Warfare Command based in Fort Bragg in North Carolina.
[00:03:55.658 --> 00:03:59.180]  We brought that story wide open, got it all over WorldNetDaily, you name it.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.743]  Now it's on WorldNetDaily that Air National Guard people are quitting in droves.
[00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.004]  People are infuriated.
[00:04:06.464 --> 00:04:12.468]  My father talked to a general in the reserves just last week who is ready to take on the enemy.
[00:04:13.028 --> 00:04:13.928]  We are prepared!
[00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:15.409]  We cannot be defeated.
[00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:16.930]  That's why we're going to use foreign troops.
[00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.531]  This is a current general.
[00:04:19.752 --> 00:04:20.772]  I've talked to other generals.
[00:04:20.792 --> 00:04:22.433]  I've had generals on my radio program.
[00:04:22.452 --> 00:04:28.052]  We've had a lot of guests, phone lines, 800 numbers here on AXS TV.
[00:04:28.052 --> 00:04:31.252]  People can't call in really from out of town looking for a married guy and we usually don't
[00:04:31.252 --> 00:04:32.252]  schedule that.
[00:04:32.252 --> 00:04:33.252]  We've had some guests.
[00:04:33.252 --> 00:04:35.252]  That might be a good idea in the future.
[00:04:35.252 --> 00:04:40.972]  But with these hour-long programs, it's important to just get the information out to the public.
[00:04:40.972 --> 00:04:46.052]  We've been working as hard as we can, struggling with the Waco remembrance yesterday down at
[00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:47.252]  the south side of the capital.
[00:04:47.252 --> 00:04:50.012]  We didn't promote it much, but a lot of folks came out and they appreciate that.
[00:04:50.012 --> 00:04:59.772]  And of course, I dropped by a church, a synagogue yesterday and they were talking about gun
[00:04:59.772 --> 00:05:00.772]  confiscation.
[00:05:00.772 --> 00:05:02.212]  They were talking about how deadly guns are.
[00:05:02.212 --> 00:05:03.212]  It really saddened me.
[00:05:03.212 --> 00:05:07.293]  A lot of people, I think Jews, should realize how dangerous it is when government comes
[00:05:07.293 --> 00:05:11.173]  to get people's guns with what happened in Hitler's Germany.
[00:05:11.173 --> 00:05:17.132]  Of course, Bruce Elphant, we heard at the public meeting we went, Bruce Elphant of course
[00:05:17.132 --> 00:05:22.812]  is the county constable and he was there speaking on some state reps.
[00:05:23.241 --> 00:05:24.602]  It was really scary.
[00:05:24.662 --> 00:05:29.626]  And of course, it's not just people at Jewish synagogues that are talking about confiscating guns.
[00:05:30.407 --> 00:05:34.651]  It's people from everywhere else in life that probably think it's a wonderful thing.
[00:05:34.691 --> 00:05:36.373]  They didn't want to be taped at a certain point.
[00:05:36.413 --> 00:05:40.036]  We were polite and cold to each other, so they didn't want us to turn the camera off.
[00:05:40.056 --> 00:05:41.737]  We'll probably have it for the next week or so.
[00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:47.002]  We're just a small cadre of people fighting as hard as we can, running all over the place.
[00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:48.864]  We've got more tape than we could ever pretty much run.
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:06:03.970]  Much less come out here and get it on three-quarter-inch television tape for you so you can see that, but so much to talk about and so little time to wake up all the different masses of people out there that have been deceived mightily.
[00:06:05.591 --> 00:06:09.254]  You know, yesterday was quite a day.
[00:06:09.334 --> 00:06:17.520]  Mike had to deal with the Klan coming up and starting stuff at the Waco Remembrance School I got there, and then we had
[00:06:18.627 --> 00:06:30.463]  Other people running around trying to make disturbances and then I go to a synagogue and people are getting quite angry that we didn't want the guns to be controlled.
[00:06:31.003 --> 00:06:35.509]  I mean it's just I get it from all sides and of course I'm not likening the people at the synagogue to
[00:06:36.923 --> 00:06:39.065]  To the Ku Klux Klan in any fashion.
[00:06:39.105 --> 00:06:42.688]  I just, you know, everybody, you know, you try to speak the truth, you try to wake people up, you're a kook.
[00:06:42.768 --> 00:06:46.351]  Once I was leaving, they'd say, yeah, go take your medication for synagogue.
[00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.092]  Well, take your medication for paranoia.
[00:06:48.393 --> 00:06:50.274]  So here I am with major news reports.
[00:06:51.155 --> 00:06:58.241]  I got the story on the AP about the black helicopter attacks, and they finally had a few highly publicized ones where they should have had them.
[00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.784]  The last one had a Fort San Houston Army base.
[00:07:01.804 --> 00:07:03.826]  Of course, they confiscated our tape trying to get footage of it.
[00:07:05.607 --> 00:07:13.173]  Mike always seems to get the blunt of everything, but these others in Port Aransas and other places, they didn't even tell anybody about it.
[00:07:13.714 --> 00:07:18.117]  Kingsville, they didn't tell the Sheriff's Department and the county, they told the police, but in Port Aransas, they didn't tell anybody.
[00:07:18.137 --> 00:07:20.619]  I just can't get back to that live fire explosions.
[00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:23.361]  We aired that on the Freedom Report from 9 to 10 o'clock tonight.
[00:07:23.381 --> 00:07:28.005]  I want to thank Rusty Fields for introing the show now that I'm on the radio an extra hour.
[00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:36.062]  A lot of the shows are going to go to tape and Vic Gill is going to be in every other week.
[00:07:37.683 --> 00:07:39.985]  Firefighter here in town, Vietnam veteran.
[00:07:40.866 --> 00:07:41.387]  Great guy.
[00:07:41.427 --> 00:07:46.227]  He's going to be in here co-hosting or actually hosting a show in the future in Rusty Fields
[00:07:46.227 --> 00:07:48.826]  and others will probably be in with him.
[00:07:48.826 --> 00:07:52.547]  If you're wondering where Steve Lane is, Steve Lane was having trouble making a living and
[00:07:52.547 --> 00:07:56.266]  being able to work the long hours and do this, but he's bowed out for a while because he's
[00:07:56.266 --> 00:07:59.027]  got two young kids and he appreciates all of Steve Lane's work.
[00:07:59.027 --> 00:08:04.347]  Mike's got two young kids and continues the battle headstrong, forward, and we do appreciate
[00:08:04.347 --> 00:08:05.826]  what Mike's doing and everybody else.
[00:08:05.826 --> 00:08:10.547]  Now I do want to take some calls tonight.
[00:08:13.697 --> 00:08:24.226]  This, again, as soon as I get that website in, the particular link to the particular part of the United States Marine Corps site, let me read some of this to you.
[00:08:24.526 --> 00:08:27.068]  March 14th, 1200 hours.
[00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:28.569]  Reconnaissance inserted.
[00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:31.692]  15th and 18th of March.
[00:08:32.412 --> 00:08:34.774]  Conduct HA slash DR operations.
[00:08:34.854 --> 00:08:36.916]  Experiment with force protection tactics.
[00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:58.683]  Techniques and Procedures, Combat Service Support Technologies, Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force, Experimental Executes to Combine Arms Experiment with Innovative Military Operations in Urban Terrain, MALT, M-O-U-T, Tactics and Adaptive Organizations.
[00:09:00.964 --> 00:09:08.424]  It continues, "Measured firepower, weapons sets, unmanned aerial vehicles in support
[00:09:08.424 --> 00:09:10.364]  of urban operations."
[00:09:10.364 --> 00:09:14.364]  Unmanned aerial vehicles, little probes out in the neighborhood about checking to be sure
[00:09:14.364 --> 00:09:15.364]  we're all safe.
[00:09:15.364 --> 00:09:16.364]  This is going to be a...
[00:09:16.364 --> 00:09:19.364]  They're going to land at the military bases and then go out into the population.
[00:09:19.364 --> 00:09:23.284]  They were going to do this in San Francisco, but Gorbachev said no, and that was even in
[00:09:23.284 --> 00:09:24.284]  mainstream papers.
[00:09:24.284 --> 00:09:27.264]  Gorbachev runs the Presidio, the old army base right there in San Francisco under the
[00:09:27.264 --> 00:09:28.264]  Golden Gate.
[00:09:28.264 --> 00:09:29.264]  We've played it here before.
[00:09:29.264 --> 00:09:30.264]  We were there a year ago.
[00:09:30.264 --> 00:09:31.264]  They came out.
[00:09:31.264 --> 00:09:32.264]  He didn't want them there, so of course, he doesn't want to be bothered.
[00:09:32.264 --> 00:09:37.124]  He wants them there to be hit for plenty of betting, but it sounds insane.
[00:09:37.124 --> 00:09:38.124]  I know.
[00:09:38.124 --> 00:09:39.124]  It's just reality.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:48.280]  RTA scenario repeats using variations of adaptive organizations, experimental objectives, the
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:54.440]  three-block war, tactics, techniques and procedures, maneuver elements, adaptability, urban close
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:59.120]  air support (that's the Harriers and the F-18s and the helicopters), combat service support
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.000]  (and they have lodged in here humanitarian operations, yeah, with the combined arms,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.440]  mid-intensity combat, measured firepower, target detection and location, taking a short,
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:18.960]  red cell command control communications, computers and intelligence, C-4-1 system, C-4-I system,
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:26.880]  excuse me), three-block war part number two, company and platoon size attacks (I love him,
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:33.480]  downtown, there he is), focused experiments on offensive operation urban sustainment issues.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:42.000]  How the love that just continues and just flows forward, that's a long sight, put that
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.440]  back out for people.
[00:10:46.064 --> 00:10:50.106]  I should tell you, I did Tex Mars' national radio program.
[00:10:50.126 --> 00:10:55.750]  He's on shortwave, micros, satellite, AM commercial, FM commercial.
[00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:56.351]  It was great.
[00:10:56.951 --> 00:10:58.332]  And Tex actually come back on later.
[00:10:58.372 --> 00:10:59.493]  He really likes the stuff I'm doing.
[00:10:59.553 --> 00:11:00.493]  I like what Tex is doing.
[00:11:00.934 --> 00:11:11.821]  Tex Mars, who lives here in Austin, retired Air Force officer, best-selling author, is going to be out at the Y2K meeting tomorrow night at Luby's time in
[00:11:12.654 --> 00:11:15.275]  In the North Central Austin, down on Burnet.
[00:11:16.395 --> 00:11:22.256]  So that takes us to tomorrow night at 7pm and we'll pop a graphic up there for you in a second.
[00:11:22.856 --> 00:11:31.419]  Alright, so we've focused experiments on offensive operations, combat arts, it's all so loving so little time.
[00:11:31.459 --> 00:11:32.439]  We have a tactical
[00:11:36.251 --> 00:11:39.092]  That's a weird... Oh, it's cut off here.
[00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:42.633]  Real-time tracking of all personnel.
[00:11:43.574 --> 00:11:45.675]  Integrated C-4-1 system.
[00:11:45.855 --> 00:11:46.835]  Indoors, outdoors.
[00:11:47.195 --> 00:11:49.296]  Potential operations application.
[00:11:49.336 --> 00:11:52.037]  Existing and emerging tactics, techniques, and procedures.
[00:11:52.257 --> 00:11:53.957]  And emerging technologies.
[00:11:54.658 --> 00:11:57.459]  Block 1, Block 2, and Block 3 invasion strategy.
[00:11:57.579 --> 00:11:59.539]  And it shows the buildings.
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.620]  Look at it for yourself.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.781]  This is a black and white copy.
[00:12:02.801 --> 00:12:04.021]  Go to the site and see it in color.
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.020]  The teleprinter was broken.
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.020]  There you have that right there for you.
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.020]  And Mike, it's really not, I mean, it's hardly intelligible for me with my 2015 eyes.
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.020]  It got up close.
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.020]  It's just a mush right there.
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.020]  But you can hear it.
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.020]  Well, no, there's no point to change the camera.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.020]  Yeah.
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.020]  I mean, you still can't, you can read the words there, but it doesn't really, doesn't
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.020]  really do anything for anybody.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.020]  So again, you can check it out.
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.020]  Can we pop that website back up there in a few minutes for people to get the United States
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.020]  Marine Corps information?
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.020]  We don't have nothing against our crimes.
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.020]  We don't have anything against our crimes.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:40.620]  Marines and sailors and airmen, I just feel sorry about what Bill Clinton's gearing up
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.620]  to use them for.
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.620]  I'm not gearing up.
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:48.980]  And again, this is our, they have authorization to do this illegal Tenth Amendment and positive
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:53.100]  commentarious violation of states' rights, but it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.100]  the history's repeating itself.
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.860]  Again, they've done military attacks in Port Aransas and other cities without even telling
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.180]  people.
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:06.020]  And that is very important for everybody to realize that's out there in the viewing area.
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.500]  All right.
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.780]  I'm not.
[00:13:10.809 --> 00:13:13.630]  Again, I kind of touched on this at the first of the program.
[00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:17.451]  Children of working moms suffer no permanent harm, studies suggest.
[00:13:17.512 --> 00:13:20.873]  Front page of the Dallas Morning News today.
[00:13:21.233 --> 00:13:25.195]  Those of you that are taping this, March 1st, 1999.
[00:13:26.235 --> 00:13:30.517]  Children of working moms suffer no permanent harm, studies suggest.
[00:13:30.617 --> 00:13:35.439]  Most small differences disappear by age 12, researchers say.
[00:13:35.479 --> 00:13:36.640]  This one researcher
[00:13:37.176 --> 00:13:39.458]  At the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
[00:13:39.498 --> 00:13:43.782]  I mean, any idiot knows that some people have to have single-parent homes.
[00:13:43.802 --> 00:13:46.044]  People die, there's divorces, there's violent people.
[00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:47.606]  People have to break out.
[00:13:49.147 --> 00:13:53.371]  And we're not bad enough in people from single-parent homes or from places where mothers work.
[00:13:53.972 --> 00:13:57.715]  But the first three and a half years, the brain is growing, the brain is wiring.
[00:13:58.115 --> 00:13:59.797]  And that is a scientific fact.
[00:14:01.479 --> 00:14:04.982]  That's why you see these kids walking around with heads that look so big.
[00:14:05.002 --> 00:14:08.104]  Same thing with puppies and stuff and all other mammals.
[00:14:08.124 --> 00:14:10.466]  The heads and the feet are big because they're growing.
[00:14:10.847 --> 00:14:14.109]  Especially at age three and a half, the head looks really huge compared to the body because it's growing.
[00:14:14.149 --> 00:14:14.610]  It's growing.
[00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:26.820]  I mean, you know, measure your kid's head from birth and watch how fast it grows in three years and watch how it pretty much stops growing except for developing some muscle mass and perhaps fat as the person gets older and sunburn and all the rest of the good stuff.
[00:14:27.798 --> 00:14:29.559]  It's just a fallacy.
[00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:31.059]  The state wants the children.
[00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:35.480]  So they want to appease people, take away the guilt, and say, put your newborn in a daycare.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.101]  Let them get all the sicknesses from the children around them.
[00:14:38.661 --> 00:14:41.482]  If you have to put them on antibiotics, screw them up.
[00:14:41.922 --> 00:14:52.065]  Let us get them early so we can have Head Start programs and teach them about how good big government is and give them the good Soviet education they deserve, the good indoctrination they deserve.
[00:14:52.325 --> 00:14:53.785]  Let me read this article, part of it.
[00:14:54.687 --> 00:14:55.808]  Today's California News.
[00:14:55.868 --> 00:15:02.553]  Children of women who work outside the home suffer no permanent harm because of their mother's absence.
[00:15:02.633 --> 00:15:07.196]  A study that evaluated the development and health of more than 6,000 youngsters suggests.
[00:15:07.536 --> 00:15:08.176]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:15:08.217 --> 00:15:15.041]  That's why normally in all of human history, you know, people just would give their child to someone else to take care of.
[00:15:16.322 --> 00:15:17.343]  It's just a fact.
[00:15:17.913 --> 00:15:22.056]  A parent loves their child, or should, and generally does, more than other people.
[00:15:22.416 --> 00:15:29.500]  Grandparents are fine, but that type of society is broken away and falling away, except in some of the indigenous third-world populations that are raising pretty good kids.
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:46.831]  But I found there was no difference between children whose mothers were employed versus children whose mothers were not employed during the first three years that Elizabeth Harvey, a psychologist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, being employed is not going to harm the children during the first
[00:15:48.163 --> 00:15:48.603]  Yes, sir.
