[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:05.332]  One of the strange sightings that have a lot of people in the Lone Star State coming up with a lot of conspiracy theories.
[00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:10.195]  Steve Langford reports on the helicopters and health problems that have hit Austin.
[00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:13.236]  It's the sound.
[00:00:13.757 --> 00:00:15.378]  It sounds just like a tornado.
[00:00:16.018 --> 00:00:18.840]  They were so loud that they shook the windows.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.381]  That's how they know they're back.
[00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:22.542]  It was huge.
[00:00:22.982 --> 00:00:26.344]  You could see the machine gun mounts on them and everything, and they were black.
[00:00:27.803 --> 00:00:29.324]  The black helicopters.
[00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:32.247]  Nine children all came down sick at the same time.
[00:00:32.687 --> 00:00:34.789]  The whole side of my car was just covered with dead gnats.
[00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:43.856]  Austin, Texas is a peaceful, laid-back kind of place, just like its favorite son, Willie Nelson.
[00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:47.318]  At least it used to be.
[00:00:47.418 --> 00:00:49.820]  Until the black helicopters arrived.
[00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:50.901]  It's bizarre.
[00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:51.902]  It's like an invasion.
[00:00:52.848 --> 00:01:00.116]  Suddenly, people all over Austin started seeing them, with some saying they'd been harassed, and maybe even poisoned by the things.
[00:01:00.597 --> 00:01:08.545]  I can confirm black helicopters are swarming all over Texas and the rest of the U.S., harassing citizens, police, anybody that gets in their way.
[00:01:08.786 --> 00:01:11.369]  Black helicopters, the strike force of the New World Order.
[00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:22.059]  Alex Jones is a popular radio talk show host with Austin's KJFK, and he's been investigating and reporting on the mysterious black helicopter phenomenon for years.
[00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:26.663]  It reads like a science fiction novel, but it's really happening.
[00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.732]  Until recently, the government, the military, and law enforcement had denied the very existence of black helicopters.
[00:01:33.932 --> 00:01:37.354]  But now, authorities concede there really are such things.
[00:01:37.714 --> 00:01:39.535]  Yes, black helicopters are real.
[00:01:39.956 --> 00:01:41.436]  They're here to take care of you.
[00:01:41.456 --> 00:01:44.358]  They're for anti-terrorist training.
[00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.641]  But Jones and others suspect the black helicopters are the real terrorists.
[00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:53.323]  You're talking about SS Cavalry right here in America.
[00:01:54.063 --> 00:02:06.195]  The sinister-looking unmarked choppers have been reported buzzing homes, following motorists, landing unannounced in schoolyards, and even dropping a mysterious white dust on Austin neighborhoods.
[00:02:06.595 --> 00:02:08.497]  See, it smears like paint.
[00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:15.163]  Norma Rubel says her car was covered with the stuff after a black helicopter flew over her house.
[00:02:15.183 --> 00:02:17.924]  Looked like somebody took a spray painter and sprayed it.
[00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:24.086]  City officials examined the mysterious substance and declared it cedar ash from a nearby forest fire.
[00:02:24.446 --> 00:02:25.966]  There's no way it looked like cedar ash.
[00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:30.347]  And she says nobody can explain what else she found on her car.
[00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:32.548]  Thousands of dead gnats.
[00:02:32.948 --> 00:02:33.708]  Something killed them.
[00:02:34.688 --> 00:02:40.851]  Meanwhile, others who have seen the black helicopters fly over their homes say the dust might have poisoned them.
[00:02:41.292 --> 00:02:44.353]  All of my kids and myself all got sick with stomach trouble.
[00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:47.915]  And the Hopkins family suspects a government cover-up.
[00:02:48.475 --> 00:02:51.517]  I think most people would like to be able to just say, well, our government would never do that.
[00:02:51.917 --> 00:02:54.199]  Alex Jones insists it would.
[00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.500]  They've tested what's been sprayed out of the helicopters.
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.462]  It has salmonella and other type bacteria that you would find in garbage.
[00:03:01.531 --> 00:03:07.377]  Jones suspects it's all part of secret government preparations for a possible state of emergency.
[00:03:07.697 --> 00:03:11.720]  We see a lot of indicators that the military is preparing for martial law.
[00:03:13.142 --> 00:03:14.843]  And Jones is not alone.
[00:03:14.863 --> 00:03:20.849]  The government has more control than they need, and I think that the black helicopters probably have something to do with it.
[00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.771]  We're in the equivalent of 1936 Germany.
[00:03:24.592 --> 00:03:27.755]  Hitler is just now getting his power, and they're getting ready to really clamp down.
[00:03:31.351 --> 00:03:33.571]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:03:34.212 --> 00:03:34.652]  That's right.
[00:03:34.672 --> 00:03:46.094]  You're watching InfoWars, short for the Information War that we all struggle against every single day in this country and across the world.
[00:03:47.354 --> 00:03:52.536]  It is Monday, August 9th, 1999, one day closer to victory.
[00:03:53.116 --> 00:03:54.396]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[00:03:56.972 --> 00:03:58.974]  The documentation is irrefutable.
[00:03:59.054 --> 00:04:03.998]  This country is slowly but surely being turned into a modern slave state.
[00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:05.740]  A modern police state.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.843]  And we struggle as hard as we can on this program to bring you accurate information.
[00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:14.347]  We believe our accuracy level is much higher than that of the mainstream media.
[00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:22.174]  You don't see us like Dateline NBC blowing up Chevrolet pickup trucks and saying they were hit by side impacts and that they're dangerous.
[00:04:22.194 --> 00:04:22.755]  You don't see us
[00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:36.620]  Like ABC running around and dirtying food at food lines and putting out rotten food, as has been reported, and being told repeatedly to stop doing it, again, as happened in the food line case.
[00:04:38.601 --> 00:04:50.628]  You see us bringing forward the best information we can, trying to sift through all the garbage, the half-truths, the manipulations, and the flat-out desensitization, as we're seeing in the new media program in the last two years.
[00:04:51.897 --> 00:05:02.621]  In the next 55 minutes, I do hope to take quite a few of your phone calls and get through a substantial amount of news that needs to be discussed here.
[00:05:03.922 --> 00:05:14.086]  We also have some other news clips from the mainstream media that we need to get to and some footage that we got today of the drug czar, General Barry McCaffrey, here in Austin.
[00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:19.194]  So I will attempt to move through all of this in the next few hours.
[00:05:21.915 --> 00:05:22.295]  I wish.
[00:05:22.775 --> 00:05:24.175]  We don't have hours like we do on the radio.
[00:05:24.215 --> 00:05:28.356]  We have one hour, and we're going to work as hard as we can to get through it all.
[00:05:28.937 --> 00:05:41.480]  Now, it's hard to know where to start, but for people in other cities, I've been on for years here in Austin, Texas, over six years, but for people that are just now seeing this program for the first time, the
[00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:45.561]  And so, Austin viewers, please bear with us.
[00:05:46.421 --> 00:05:48.282]  And I'm not going to insult your intelligence out there.
[00:05:48.302 --> 00:05:50.203]  A lot of you know something's wrong.
[00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:55.545]  Deep down inside, you know that you've lost control of your life when it comes to your relationship with the government.
[00:05:56.546 --> 00:06:05.830]  You understand that it's no longer the people's government, that it belongs to the bureaucracies and the criminal crime rings, the society of criminals and parasites that controls it.
[00:06:07.262 --> 00:06:09.083]  But just to understand that isn't enough.
[00:06:09.143 --> 00:06:11.845]  You have to go further and have a grasp of history.
[00:06:12.185 --> 00:06:15.367]  And understand who controls this nation and much of the world today.
[00:06:15.707 --> 00:06:19.970]  Who is striving for a global system of control.
[00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.810]  How are they doing it?
[00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.091]  Through the central banks.
[00:06:22.511 --> 00:06:29.055]  The private, run-for-profit institutions that have seized control of most nations, currencies, and their banking systems.
[00:06:29.195 --> 00:06:35.619]  In 1913, this nation succumbed to the Federal Reserve, which is private, run-for-profit, cannot be audited, has no reserves.
[00:06:37.552 --> 00:06:41.776]  If you go back and read the congressional records from 1913, there were great debates and arguments over this.
[00:06:42.036 --> 00:06:52.926]  All the elections before, one of the central issues was banking and the European, predominantly British, interest attempting to seize control of our currency system.
[00:06:53.006 --> 00:07:03.556]  And that is in the Constitution that they should defend the borders, have a military, a navy for outside the U.S., not a standing army, and coin the nation's
[00:07:04.298 --> 00:07:05.739]  Currency or their script.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.802]  That's what the debate is really about.
[00:07:09.422 --> 00:07:16.628]  Imagine if you had a money machine and you were allowed, the only person, the only group, the only corporation that was allowed to print the money and then loan it out at interest.
[00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:19.210]  Think of the power you would soon gain.
[00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:22.253]  Well, that's the monopoly they have.
[00:07:22.773 --> 00:07:24.735]  And that's the center of our problem.
[00:07:24.915 --> 00:07:27.257]  That's where all of their power emanates from.
[00:07:28.923 --> 00:07:39.811]  Now, we've made some massive strides because of thousands and millions of people that have worked incredibly hard over the last 50 years to expose what's happening, and even before.
[00:07:40.972 --> 00:07:45.755]  We have the Republican Party of Texas, which George Bush turned his back on.
[00:07:46.055 --> 00:07:47.897]  I'm not a Republican or a Democrat, I want to make that clear.
[00:07:48.257 --> 00:07:52.260]  But the people in the Republican Party, at their convention, their delegates,
[00:07:54.116 --> 00:08:00.840]  Put it down in their charter that the Federal Reserve is private, run for profit, there are no reserves, and it cannot be audited, and it should be revoked.
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.781]   that they should investigate the federal reserve, the trilateral commission, the CFR, and other
[00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:07.141]   global organizations.
[00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:10.141]   [Music]
