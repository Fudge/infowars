[00:00:01.454 --> 00:00:04.378]  We are entering the Eye of the Checkpoint.
[00:00:04.398 --> 00:00:04.818]  Caution!
[00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:05.759]  Reduce speed!
[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.021]  Checkpoint ahead!
[00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:09.024]  Isn't that loving, children?
[00:00:11.146 --> 00:00:12.848]  Nice big generator on that.
[00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.853]  Alright, let's go real slow a bit.
[00:00:17.193 --> 00:00:19.193]  It's just pulling together, fellas.
[00:00:19.193 --> 00:00:43.194]  [Music]
[00:00:43.194 --> 00:00:46.194]  [Music]
[00:00:44.515 --> 00:00:47.515]  [Music]
[00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:50.515]  [Music]
[00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:54.515]  [Music]
[00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:58.515]  [Music]
[00:00:58.515 --> 00:01:02.515]  [Music]
[00:01:02.515 --> 00:01:06.515]  [Music]
[00:01:06.515 --> 00:01:10.515]  [Music]
[00:01:10.515 --> 00:01:14.515]  [Music]
[00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:18.515]  [Music]
[00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:22.515]  [Music]
[00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:26.515]  [Music]
[00:01:26.515 --> 00:01:30.515]  [Music]
[00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:34.515]  [Music]
[00:01:34.515 --> 00:01:38.515]  [Music]
[00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:42.515]  [Music]
[00:01:43.515 --> 00:01:46.515]  [Music]
[00:01:46.515 --> 00:01:50.515]  [Music]
[00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:54.515]  [Music]
[00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:58.515]  [Music]
[00:01:58.515 --> 00:02:02.515]  [Music]
[00:02:02.515 --> 00:02:06.515]  [Music]
[00:02:06.515 --> 00:02:20.194]  [Music]
[00:02:20.327 --> 00:02:22.330]  Go past the chimney.
[00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:29.349]  Okay, here we go, all right, here we are, stop, go past him, Jimmy, go past him.
[00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:36.349]  Go past him, Trevor, Trevor.
[00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:37.349]  [inaudible]
[00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.550]  We'll find a place.
[00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.311]  Here's what I'm trying to do.
[00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:42.351]  Pull up past this red truck.
[00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:43.191]  We'll start a police car.
[00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:43.851]  All the way.
[00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:46.032]  You pull it into the woods.
[00:02:46.112 --> 00:02:48.412]  I'll pay for it.
[00:02:49.012 --> 00:02:49.312]  All right.
[00:02:49.332 --> 00:02:52.353]  All right, let's go.
[00:02:52.373 --> 00:02:52.793]  Get it.
[00:02:52.813 --> 00:02:53.853]  Get it.
[00:02:53.913 --> 00:02:54.593]  I got it.
[00:02:55.073 --> 00:02:55.533]  Oh, yes, sir.
[00:02:55.653 --> 00:02:56.853]  I'm a syndicated talk show host.
[00:02:56.873 --> 00:02:58.014]  I also make documentaries.
[00:02:58.034 --> 00:02:59.494]  I'm out here covering this.
[00:02:59.994 --> 00:03:01.014]  You said okay.
[00:03:01.094 --> 00:03:01.734]  Of course.
[00:03:01.834 --> 00:03:08.834]  He said, "Okay, I'm bored. I'm gonna get it."
[00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:10.407]  Let's walk on down, Hanson.
[00:03:10.427 --> 00:03:12.229]  You go, you lead the way.
[00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:17.493]  Hey, this knife isn't working good.
[00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.954]  Here it is, my friends.
[00:03:28.334 --> 00:03:28.815]  America.
[00:03:30.015 --> 00:03:33.378]  2.4 billion dollars by Bill Clinton in 1999 for federal checkpoints.
[00:03:33.718 --> 00:03:34.678]  Federal funding.
[00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.700]  You're seeing MJTF right now.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.762]  Police from all different counties in Central Texas and Austin.
[00:03:40.102 --> 00:03:41.163]  Working together.
[00:03:41.243 --> 00:03:42.844]  Bringing you the police case.
[00:03:42.864 --> 00:03:44.065]  It's going to get a lot worse.
[00:03:44.105 --> 00:03:45.706]  The war against guns is raging.
[00:03:46.186 --> 00:03:49.706]  We're in 1936 Germany right now.
[00:03:49.706 --> 00:03:54.706]  [Police sirens]
[00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:55.090]  No.
[00:03:57.752 --> 00:04:00.775]  I'm going to try to interview one.
[00:04:00.855 --> 00:04:05.898]  How much time we got left on the battery?
[00:04:05.918 --> 00:04:11.002]  Fifty-seven.
[00:04:11.823 --> 00:04:15.405]  Let me see.
[00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:16.266]  Here we go, guys.
[00:04:16.967 --> 00:04:18.788]  We're getting shined on right here.
[00:04:18.807 --> 00:04:25.367]  here. What's up?
[00:04:25.367 --> 00:04:30.829]  Well, we're getting the light shined on us by the... I mean, black uniforms, everything.
[00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:31.829]  This is incredible.
[00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:37.131]  This is incredible.
[00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:39.471]  Sir, look at that aggressive behavior.
[00:04:39.591 --> 00:04:41.552]  Okay, guys, America is in deep trouble.
[00:04:41.592 --> 00:04:50.375]  Get back to the checkpoint.
[00:04:50.475 --> 00:04:52.395]  I work for you, Alex.
[00:04:52.495 --> 00:04:53.916]  Of course you do, Mike.
[00:04:54.555 --> 00:04:55.555]  Thank you.
[00:04:55.555 --> 00:05:00.195]  [Music]
[00:05:00.302 --> 00:05:03.643]  You got a vehicle coming.
[00:05:03.683 --> 00:05:08.324]  Don't get too much of it, or the knife isn't good.
[00:05:08.784 --> 00:05:09.484]  Hey, are y'all MJTF?
[00:05:09.624 --> 00:05:10.945]  Is this an MJTF operation?
[00:05:10.965 --> 00:05:17.346]  We're actually, uh... We're serving soldiers over here in Jacksonville.
[00:05:17.386 --> 00:05:18.327]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:05:18.727 --> 00:05:20.467]  Do you even know where this funding comes from?
[00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:25.308]  Uh, we're trying to see if we got the wrong fund for our military.
[00:05:25.328 --> 00:05:27.149]  Yeah.
[00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.349]  Yeah.
[00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:27.529]  Oh.
[00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:27.849]  Yeah.
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.302]  I've been researching this for eight years.
[00:05:32.322 --> 00:05:33.483]  I've been laughed at.
[00:05:33.503 --> 00:05:34.864]  Now I'm on the front page of the statement.
[00:05:34.884 --> 00:05:36.085]  This stuff is real, sir.
[00:05:37.105 --> 00:05:38.526]  And y'all can rationalize what you're doing.
[00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:40.728]  There'll be more decisions for you in the future.
[00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:44.951]  You came back from California where they're building a concentration camp.
[00:05:44.971 --> 00:05:49.614]  Did they get military uniforms on?
[00:05:53.042 --> 00:05:54.543]  You're telling us you're serving soldiers.
[00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:55.283]  We don't buy that.
[00:05:55.303 --> 00:05:56.044]  We're not crackpots.
[00:05:56.084 --> 00:05:57.284]  We're being serious.
[00:05:57.304 --> 00:05:59.946]  This is an MJTF operation, correct?
[00:06:00.006 --> 00:06:01.506]  Multi-Jurisdictional Task Force?
[00:06:02.807 --> 00:06:04.768]  Absolutely.
[00:06:04.808 --> 00:06:09.931]  We're on a minute, man.
[00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:16.274]  Looks like they're in service.
[00:06:16.494 --> 00:06:16.854]  They are.
[00:06:17.975 --> 00:06:19.176]  We're supposed to stop the bad guys.
[00:06:19.196 --> 00:06:24.840]  You know, the CIA brings in the narcotics and also did it for 10 years after Vietnam and these guys just don't know it.
[00:06:26.401 --> 00:06:27.822]  I tell you, it's something else.
[00:06:28.663 --> 00:06:32.706]  And if days like these just reinvigorate me to do double my efforts.
[00:06:32.846 --> 00:06:34.907]  I don't want to talk to the camera.
[00:06:34.947 --> 00:06:41.272]  My friends, we stand at the threshold.
[00:06:41.332 --> 00:06:42.072]  This is it.
[00:06:42.452 --> 00:06:42.933]  Here we go.
[00:06:43.833 --> 00:06:45.755]  My friends, we stand at the threshold.
[00:06:46.778 --> 00:06:51.658]  What you're seeing here is federal funding, $2.4 billion, signed by Bill Clinton four
[00:06:51.658 --> 00:06:52.658]  months ago.
[00:06:52.658 --> 00:06:53.658]  It's expanding nationwide.
[00:06:53.658 --> 00:06:59.737]  Under Bill Clinton's National Seat Belt Use Initiative, they're going to be searching
[00:06:59.737 --> 00:07:03.057]  vehicles for any other parameter reasons, and the mainstream media will say it's for
[00:07:03.057 --> 00:07:06.737]  stolen cars or seat belt use to guarantee your safety.
[00:07:06.737 --> 00:07:10.298]  The federal government's already destroyed federal buildings.
[00:07:10.298 --> 00:07:18.617]  All right, guys.
[00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.295]  Hope you enjoy that night vision camera.
[00:07:21.278 --> 00:07:24.018]  Devil Jones brought to you.
[00:07:24.018 --> 00:07:46.698]  [pause]
[00:07:46.664 --> 00:07:50.166]  It's probably a football on another channel or something for you, so you might want to just tune out.
[00:07:50.186 --> 00:07:51.686]  I know most of you don't give a damn.
[00:07:52.967 --> 00:07:54.848]  We've got about, what, 45 minutes of tape.
[00:07:54.868 --> 00:08:01.070]  That was edited tape, just us running around like a bunch of madmen with a little night vision camera.
[00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.712]  We want to thank Mike Hanson and Jimmy Ritter and folks for being there.
[00:08:04.732 --> 00:08:07.974]  We were up here last night trying to put together Police State 2000 until late in the evening.
[00:08:07.994 --> 00:08:09.314]  We got a call about the checkpoint.
[00:08:10.014 --> 00:08:15.497]  First one they've done on this magnitude floodlights the whole nine yards.
[00:08:18.942 --> 00:08:23.425]  Let's just go ahead and go to... I've got my radio notes here that I haven't really ordered.
[00:08:23.444 --> 00:08:39.085]  I might get off the air at 10 and run down here for North Austin, North Research.
[00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:41.664]  (gentle music)
[00:08:41.776 --> 00:08:42.796]  Yeah, I tell ya!
[00:08:43.777 --> 00:08:47.119]  I am looking at the other... I'm looking for another place to live right now.
[00:08:50.558 --> 00:08:53.340]  More and more, man, if I had the money, I'd leave this country in a minute.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.362]  Had a family here since the Revolutionary War.
[00:08:57.482 --> 00:08:59.203]  Family here since 1829 in Texas.
[00:09:01.265 --> 00:09:02.966]  Got land in 1830 and I want out of here.
[00:09:03.806 --> 00:09:06.448]  You people are gonna suck on it, you're gonna love it, and I hope you enjoy it.
[00:09:07.789 --> 00:09:09.190]  Damn it, man, I want to win the lottery.
[00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:10.470]  Too bad I never played it.
[00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:12.372]  It's a joke, you never played it.
[00:09:12.452 --> 00:09:15.834]  I don't know why I'm here on the air.
[00:09:15.854 --> 00:09:17.635]  I don't know why Mike's back there running the show.
[00:09:20.583 --> 00:09:23.585]  Our police are a bunch of cowards, engaging in this criminal activity.
[00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:26.166]  Alright, this is Info Wars.
[00:09:30.108 --> 00:09:31.489]  Newest program we bring you here.
[00:09:32.109 --> 00:09:33.470]  We try to bring you this information.
[00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:37.753]  Alright, let me just focus and do this.
[00:09:39.588 --> 00:09:46.052]  We told you six months ago when President Clinton signed 2.4 billion dollars for his National Initiative for Seat Belt Use.
[00:09:46.092 --> 00:09:50.815]  We have a link to their sites and the particular documents on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:51.115 --> 00:09:56.138]  Hundreds of pages of documents interspersed between love of the children, children, children, children.
[00:09:56.198 --> 00:09:58.159]  I'm not exaggerating the cult of the children.
[00:09:58.179 --> 00:09:58.860]  You'll hear about that.
[00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:04.120]  have things like members of buckle up America partnership can help law enforcement in their
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.319]  efforts to develop enforcement programs that are both effective and visible. It might mean
[00:10:08.319 --> 00:10:15.399]  assisting them with safety checkpoints, promoting enforcement activities, or donating merchandise
[00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:18.879]  or coupons that law enforcement officers can distribute to properly buckled up Austinites.
[00:10:18.879 --> 00:10:24.279]  It'll be funds for the kids that go to the checkpoints. In Dallas last week, they were
[00:10:24.279 --> 00:10:27.679]  brutally grabbing people out of cars. This was in half of what happened here in Austin.
[00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:37.679]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:10:35.362 --> 00:10:42.244]  We got there, there were hundreds of police cars interspersed all over the place, down the highway, pulling people over randomly on Northbound.
[00:10:42.304 --> 00:10:44.665]  Southbound they had it restricted to one lane of traffic.
[00:10:45.005 --> 00:10:51.747]  Two lanes and one lane, you go through, they shine the light in your eyes.
[00:10:51.827 --> 00:10:52.687]  In fact, Mike, if you can
[00:10:54.521 --> 00:10:56.422]  Go back to that and show people that.
[00:10:56.442 --> 00:10:58.183]  I mean, this is not for Germany.
[00:10:58.223 --> 00:10:59.003]  Papers, please.
[00:10:59.063 --> 00:10:59.944]  But it's much more than that.
[00:10:59.964 --> 00:11:01.865]  They've got the national ID card for you.
[00:11:01.885 --> 00:11:05.767]  They tortured and killed a lot of people.
[00:11:06.827 --> 00:11:08.248]  They tried to bring you this information.
[00:11:08.268 --> 00:11:16.172]  One of the police officers that was involved in Oklahoma City, they say, committed suicide trying to wake people up.
[00:11:18.433 --> 00:11:23.356]  During the President's third point in his, when you put it out on your average computer setting,
[00:11:23.857 --> 00:11:25.438]  Page 13 to 26 pages.
[00:11:25.458 --> 00:11:31.603]  Another benefit of increased traffic enforcement, in addition to saving lives and dollars, is a measurable reduction in crime.
[00:11:31.823 --> 00:11:37.828]  Active, highly visible traffic enforcement provides a major opportunity to catch criminals, as most criminals drive to and from crime scenes.
[00:11:37.868 --> 00:11:51.899]  It is not surprising that as many as one-third of criminal apprehensions occur as part of traffic stops, nor is it surprising that high-intensity law enforcement programs such as those conducted in North Carolina and Tennessee result in a large number of criminal apprehensions and recoveries of stolen property.
[00:11:53.277 --> 00:11:54.778]  You're guilty until proven innocent.
[00:11:56.499 --> 00:12:01.061]  Last night, they said they were there looking for any stolen equipment.
[00:12:01.781 --> 00:12:04.123]  Bulldozers and things from construction sites.
[00:12:04.183 --> 00:12:06.824]  Funny, they were pulling over small cars.
[00:12:07.064 --> 00:12:09.405]  Are somebody going to hide a bulldozer in the trunk?
[00:12:11.566 --> 00:12:14.548]  Also, the $2.4 billion is being passed out.
[00:12:15.088 --> 00:12:16.489]  That's separate from the $4.8 billion.
[00:12:17.463 --> 00:12:20.085]  You have the total pandemic expansion of evil.
[00:12:20.144 --> 00:12:23.924]  We've got military teams to work with law enforcement, like Delta Force, good police
[00:12:23.924 --> 00:12:28.764]  chiefs like Allie Phillips of the San Antonio Paramount, who can drive, we've got that information
[00:12:28.764 --> 00:12:35.845]  to you here on this program by our exhaustive efforts.
[00:12:35.845 --> 00:12:39.664]  You have the total pandemic expansion of evil.
[00:12:39.664 --> 00:12:44.125]  You have police accepting this wholeheartedly.
[00:12:44.125 --> 00:12:54.125]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:51.136]  They had the volunteers out there last night in the little gray uniforms as these documents state.
[00:12:55.118 --> 00:12:56.579]  People working with the police.
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.441]  My friends, that is Nazi Germany.
[00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:02.242]  That is criminal in its nature.
[00:13:02.843 --> 00:13:04.684]  And this is a federal program.
[00:13:04.824 --> 00:13:06.345]  That's us going down the northbound lane.
[00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:12.528]  Look at the traffic for miles and miles and miles and miles.
[00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:15.820]  They're doing it all over the state and all over the country.
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.281]  North Carolina was the test state.
[00:13:18.121 --> 00:13:20.242]  Inheritable armored fortress now.
[00:13:21.223 --> 00:13:21.783]  Take a look at this.
[00:13:21.803 --> 00:13:28.586]  In fact, Mike, back it up about three seconds and pre-frame it for everybody to see the traffic column going back in.
[00:13:28.606 --> 00:13:29.927]  We'll turn and look at the northbound lane.
[00:13:31.336 --> 00:13:35.976]  It was backed up by the time we got out of here last night at 11.30, trying to just view
[00:13:35.976 --> 00:13:39.856]  the hundreds of hours of tape we had that none of you have even seen yet of concentration
[00:13:39.856 --> 00:13:43.417]  camps, Marines working with foreign groups declaring, "We work for PEN, we work for the
[00:13:43.417 --> 00:13:44.417]  U.N."
[00:13:44.417 --> 00:13:49.417]  Paid actors waving their IDs saying, "The Marine Corps hired," saying, "We're Americans, you
[00:13:49.417 --> 00:13:54.736]  can't do this to us."
[00:13:54.736 --> 00:13:56.736]  Meanwhile...
[00:13:55.976 --> 00:13:58.838]  In Serbia, the second school bus in four days was bombed.
[00:13:59.438 --> 00:14:09.183]  The death toll is now at about 80 dead people, mainly children, school buses, large school buses bombing children, mainly the relocation of served children.
[00:14:10.672 --> 00:14:13.975]  And you'll believe the propaganda from the congenital liar Bill Clinton.
[00:14:13.995 --> 00:14:20.819]  They have five billion a year coming out of Serbia in clean burning coal, oil, and gold from one region.
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.260]  That's what this war is about.
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.101]  It's a sovereign nation.
[00:14:23.461 --> 00:14:28.085]  This is the mafia bombing a local shopkeeper to scare all the other people in the global village.
[00:14:29.866 --> 00:14:30.687]  Hit pause, Mike.
[00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.271]  I heard Mike saying it won't work.
[00:14:36.291 --> 00:14:36.471]  Oh my.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.881]  I don't even know why I come here.
[00:14:43.201 --> 00:14:46.403]  I don't even know why I do this, but I'm here to tell you I've got a bad attitude.
[00:14:46.423 --> 00:14:47.444]  I've got a loser attitude.
[00:14:47.844 --> 00:14:50.786]  Vic Vreeland's all bummed out because he only got 1,500, 1,600 votes.
[00:14:51.626 --> 00:14:55.869]  What, fourth place or something in a six-person, eight-person race against Darryl Boondoggle-Slusher.
[00:14:56.569 --> 00:14:57.670]  And really, we are winning.
[00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.451]  The enemy's going to cleave a lot tighter.
[00:14:59.471 --> 00:15:00.632]  It's the arrogance of history.
[00:15:01.532 --> 00:15:03.994]  And that's a cop pulling somebody over.
[00:15:05.555 --> 00:15:06.815]  That's from the northbound side.
[00:15:06.835 --> 00:15:09.237]  They were just randomly pulling people over, carte blanche.
[00:15:10.114 --> 00:15:13.336]  We'll probably put most of this tape on replay sometime when we have time.
[00:15:13.356 --> 00:15:14.617]  That's some fabulous camera work.
[00:15:14.637 --> 00:15:15.738]  People aren't vomiting yet.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.183]  Yeah, that's the nitrate deposit.
[00:15:23.203 --> 00:15:30.489]  That's us going over the overpass there for you just to have a nice look at everything that was going on yesterday.
[00:15:31.549 --> 00:15:35.392]  You see, in a free country, you're innocent until proven guilty.
[00:15:35.432 --> 00:15:36.813]  You're not randomly singled out.
[00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:38.795]  I know many of you will say, what do I have to hide?
[00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.811]  It's a real pleasure for us to be able to do this.
[00:15:41.831 --> 00:15:43.491]  Maybe so.
[00:15:43.511 --> 00:15:44.832]  Maybe that's what you're into.
[00:15:44.852 --> 00:15:46.092]  Maybe that's what you think is fun.
[00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:49.154]  Maybe you like the police wearing black uniforms and a ski mask.
[00:15:49.174 --> 00:15:51.514]  Maybe you like them getting armored personnel carriers in the military.
[00:15:51.895 --> 00:15:52.675]  Maybe you like police
