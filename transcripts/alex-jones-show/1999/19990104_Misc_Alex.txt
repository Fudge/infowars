[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.071]  I've blown up at people and been disparaging, whereas I shouldn't have been.
[00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:26.783]  I have just personally been dealing with some things, and the stress of doing two radio programs a day, and this television show, and trying to write a book, and make a new documentary, and all these things that are new to me, just trying to get the job done, that I have lost sight of the goal, and that is to educate the public about the real political paradigm, not the thousand lies that are out there.
[00:00:27.572 --> 00:00:34.117]  What you're watching tonight, or today when you're watching a tape program of this, is not some holy truth, some magic truth.
[00:00:34.157 --> 00:00:35.337]  We don't have all the answers.
[00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:43.043]  We don't say this yet to prescribe, I mean, subscribe to everything that we say.
[00:00:43.063 --> 00:00:47.946]  All we're talking about is key facts, things that need to be understood.
[00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.907]  The Federal Reserve is private, run for profit.
[00:00:50.308 --> 00:00:54.831]  They tell you that it's governmental, when the Congressional Record and all the facts show it's not.
[00:00:55.768 --> 00:00:59.130]  The IRS, the Internal Revenue Service, it's not being overhauled.
[00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.131]  There may be some window dressing being done, but it's simple.
[00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:07.454]  It's a criminal collection agency for the private banks, a select cadre of the Federal Reserve.
[00:01:08.674 --> 00:01:11.816]  With the Internal Revenue Service, there is no innocent until proven guilty.
[00:01:12.116 --> 00:01:13.416]  There is no due process.
[00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:19.279]  Now, any American or any person on the whole planet should be able to understand those simple facts.
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.841]  I have a great responsibility doing this
[00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:30.809]  Access television program, and some might laugh at that, but I get letters now from dozens of countries.
[00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.250]  From Europe, from as far flung as even Australia.
[00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:38.751]  Letters from Canada, people that listen to my radio program.
[00:01:40.451 --> 00:01:42.092]  Not my local one, but my syndicated one.
[00:01:43.552 --> 00:01:50.253]  And people that have gotten bootleg copies of Access television programs.
[00:01:50.313 --> 00:01:52.174]  It's not really bootleg, because it's free for everybody.
[00:01:52.214 --> 00:01:52.974]  What I should say is,
[00:01:53.624 --> 00:01:57.467]  5th, 6th, 8th, 10th generation copies floating around the world.
[00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:03.831]  And in the future I really do intend to start bringing some of these letters in here and reading them on the air.
[00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:06.693]  I get a lot of letters every week, sometimes 50 to 100.
[00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:08.194]  I mean, I lose count.
[00:02:08.674 --> 00:02:10.035]  I don't have a staff or anything.
[00:02:10.075 --> 00:02:13.557]  I have a camera guy who's Mike and other people that help out.
[00:02:13.597 --> 00:02:14.538]  I do appreciate that.
[00:02:14.558 --> 00:02:16.339]  And Buckley and Andy for exposing corruption.
[00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:22.183]  I don't even have a producer for my radio programs, but I have a producer per se that makes sure things are run right.
[00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:23.818]  Those type of operations.
[00:02:23.838 --> 00:02:25.058]  But that's enough talking about me.
[00:02:25.158 --> 00:02:31.900]  I just appreciate everybody out there in Austin, Texas that's trying to do something that's standing up on a consistent basis.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:43.242]  If Alex Jones, with all my faults, and my rough delivery can wake up tens of thousands of people, then I assure you, you can wake up tens of thousands of people.
[00:02:43.702 --> 00:02:51.524]  All it takes is a sustained effort, planning those scenes in an effort, and moving forward on a consistent basis.
[00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:59.631]  That's how the criminal elite, the power elite, the old money has been able to get a massive stranglehold upon this country.
[00:03:00.192 --> 00:03:13.461]  In the future, I'm going to start trying to read from congressional records, bringing out this information going back hundreds of years, up until the present day, and show you where we've been and where we're going and what the political debate was in the past.
[00:03:14.222 --> 00:03:18.885]  And you'll be shocked at how conscious most people were about the real system worldwide.
[00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:23.835]  And also, we're going to try to bring you more productions in our rough fashion.
[00:03:23.855 --> 00:03:27.377]  We don't have much time or energy or money, but more stories.
[00:03:28.557 --> 00:03:44.823]  Last Monday on this program, I told you that last Wednesday, I told you that we were going to have some clips from a county commissioner's meeting in Marion County in Florida, where the county commissioner said he can't believe it, but the U.N.
[00:03:46.324 --> 00:03:49.465]  is actually involved in some of the land takeovers in the area.
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.601]  We're gonna play that Wednesday for you.
[00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:53.182]  Last Wednesday, I wasn't on the air.
[00:03:53.222 --> 00:03:53.783]  I didn't know that.
[00:03:53.803 --> 00:04:00.468]  They ran some three-year-old, two-year-old backup tape instead because there was a class up here at that time.
[00:04:00.968 --> 00:04:05.251]  And every fifth week of the month, when there is a fifth week of the month, I will not be on the air.
[00:04:05.271 --> 00:04:05.852]  It'll be a tape.
[00:04:05.872 --> 00:04:06.432]  I won't be live.
[00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:11.456]  But tonight, we have a tape that Mike put together out of hours of video.
[00:04:11.476 --> 00:04:13.738]  He just came in here and grabbed some clips out.
[00:04:14.518 --> 00:04:16.760]  Mike pretty much videos everything now when we're out and about.
[00:04:17.922 --> 00:04:19.722]  And you never know what you'll see.
[00:04:19.742 --> 00:04:26.024]  This is the County Commissioner's Court meeting last week where we discussed possible election fraud.
[00:04:26.784 --> 00:04:34.886]  And Mike, I'm here sad to say I did not bring the tape we aired last week where I predicted it November 10th after the election.
[00:04:37.887 --> 00:04:41.708]  Oh yeah, and I think we also have some of the Channel 36 newscast that was aired.
[00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:46.089]  We should add that two other media outlets were there but decided not to run the stories.
[00:04:46.724 --> 00:05:01.960]  And someone very close to me that works in media, that I cannot disclose, told me that the people that were getting the video and the reporters wanted to air my comments and other comments, but they felt that I was just trying to hog the spotlight.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.987]  There was a dozen other speakers there that spoke on this that they could have put on television, and I find that's a cheap excuse to do that.
[00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.731]  It was your camera crew that came up to me when I was sitting down and asked me to come outside and talk to them.
[00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:20.215]  I don't remember what media cameras it was, but 36 did run the information and did put me in there.
[00:05:20.255 --> 00:05:21.235]  I didn't ask them to.
[00:05:22.016 --> 00:05:23.116]  But they should.
[00:05:23.316 --> 00:05:27.458]  The other news agencies... Mike, which ones... What were the others that didn't run it?
[00:05:27.538 --> 00:05:27.939]  I forget.
[00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:33.161]  It was just two other cameras that didn't... 24 never showed up.
[00:05:37.327 --> 00:05:38.007]  Okay, K.I.
[00:05:38.027 --> 00:05:41.309]  and Fox, CBS and Fox candidate.
[00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.532]  And Sunlightner used to work for 24, so.
[00:05:46.672 --> 00:05:48.894]  The county commission, we're talking about possible election fraud.
[00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:50.014]  We were down there right after it.
[00:05:50.494 --> 00:05:54.317]  And by the way, we've got the little forms we're supposed to fill out to be on the little committee.
[00:05:55.877 --> 00:05:58.459]  The Travis County Clerk's Election Task Force.
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.421]  And the two county commissioners have asked us to be on this.
[00:06:02.701 --> 00:06:03.882]  But enough of this.
[00:06:04.796 --> 00:06:05.616]  Austin stuff.
[00:06:05.936 --> 00:06:07.197]  It's important to talk about.
[00:06:07.217 --> 00:06:13.979]  Enough of our little local yokel fights that we're waging.
[00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:20.522]  I know you guys don't tune in to this program to hear Alex Jones banter about what we're doing here locally.
[00:06:20.562 --> 00:06:27.204]  Some of you do and I think it's important that we all fight locally where we can actually step out there and feel it and taste it and see it.
[00:06:27.784 --> 00:06:30.065]  But let me get into some shocking information for you.
[00:06:31.897 --> 00:06:38.683]  There is some speculation now for the last five or six days in the media circles that I trust.
[00:06:39.664 --> 00:06:43.287]  Matt Grudge, who has an ABC radio program.
[00:06:43.967 --> 00:06:50.974]  He also has a short program on Fox News, The National Deal.
[00:06:52.975 --> 00:06:55.958]  Matt Grudge is
[00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:59.004]  Investigator Reporter has done a lot of great work.
[00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:05.609]  He has a very popular and interesting website, www.drugsreport.com, which you might want to check out.
[00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.993]  And he's been putting out some information, and I also got this from back channels.
[00:07:12.534 --> 00:07:26.103]  It looks like in the next two weeks, you're going to see, maybe even in the next week, you're going to see a story break on human cloning by the National Security Agency and other governmental agencies.
[00:07:28.064 --> 00:07:31.647]  And other nations, that's cloning as human beings, going back 20 years.
[00:07:31.927 --> 00:07:33.908]  I've heard that from many different people that I trust.
[00:07:35.269 --> 00:07:50.440]  You also may see a story where Clinton threatens to bring down the whole government, bringing out CIA information about drug running, involving the Bush administration and other administrations, which he's been involved with intimately.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:56.945]  You see, Bill Clinton now controls the CIA, and there's been an important report that
[00:07:58.635 --> 00:08:17.545]  Came out about 11 months ago, almost 11 months ago, when the Inspector General of the CIA first came out and said that there was some problems, basically that the CIA allowed drug running to go on during the 80s, which we know is a bunch of garbage.
[00:08:18.285 --> 00:08:24.769]  Drug running has been engaged in by the Central Intelligence Agency going back into the late 1940s at its inception.
[00:08:25.154 --> 00:08:37.004]  And the OSS, long before that, was involved bringing out opium and then the purified and strengthened derivative, heroin, out of Southeast Asia.
[00:08:37.485 --> 00:08:42.149]  So, again, this is a very serious cash crop, just heroin and cocaine alone, of the narcotics family.
[00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:47.133]  Here in the continental U.S., it's around $250 billion to $300 billion a year.
[00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:51.137]  And governments have always been involved
[00:08:51.926 --> 00:08:52.766]  In the black market.
[00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:56.087]  A lot of times they create black markets to run out their competition.
[00:08:56.807 --> 00:09:01.008]  I do not support narcotics unless they're used in medical type cases.
[00:09:01.488 --> 00:09:03.749]  I'm not here arguing for the legalization of drugs.
[00:09:04.149 --> 00:09:07.149]  I just want you to wake up and see what's been happening.
[00:09:07.289 --> 00:09:08.490]  That's Amina Airfield.
[00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.170]  We've had Terry Reid on the program.
[00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:17.012]  Former CIA and also... Was he Naval or Air Force?
[00:09:17.052 --> 00:09:19.092]  Yes, he was Air Force intelligence.
[00:09:20.322 --> 00:09:24.705]  He has a book out, Compromised Clinton Bush the CIA, very interesting.
[00:09:24.725 --> 00:09:33.269]  He actually saw Bill Clinton taking delivery of large coolers marked organs that were filled with cocaine and heroin.
[00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:44.596]  But the Inspector General of the Central Intelligence Agency is due by the 14th or 15th to come out openly.
[00:09:45.576 --> 00:09:46.657]  That is openly.
[00:09:47.473 --> 00:09:51.336]  And bring out drug running by the Reagan administration.
[00:09:51.776 --> 00:09:55.099]  Now I'm not saying Ronald Reagan was sitting around and knee-deep in cocaine.
[00:09:55.119 --> 00:09:59.942]  It was George Bush that ran that administration, especially after Reagan was shot in 1981.
[00:10:01.063 --> 00:10:04.125]  But I have this from very credible sources.
[00:10:05.045 --> 00:10:06.867]  People associated with World Net Daily.
[00:10:06.967 --> 00:10:08.568]  They haven't even put it out on their sites yet.
[00:10:09.388 --> 00:10:12.531]  People like the publisher of the Free American, Clay Douglas.
[00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:15.693]  Actual, former, top-level
[00:10:16.528 --> 00:10:21.451]  We're talking Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff, former Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff that I've personally talked to.
[00:10:22.172 --> 00:10:23.733]  This is what's going around in Washington.
[00:10:26.234 --> 00:10:31.238]  That's the beauty of having a public radio program that's nationwide.
[00:10:31.278 --> 00:10:35.060]  I'm able to get connected with these fine people that are standing up for the Constitution.
[00:10:36.821 --> 00:10:40.304]  But the human cloning story is probably the most frightening.
[00:10:41.384 --> 00:10:45.167]  Biometrics, which is human imaging technology,
[00:10:46.315 --> 00:10:57.159]  And the biotech industry, which is cloning and genetic research, is really 20 years ahead of what you're seeing in the media right now.
[00:10:58.459 --> 00:11:06.022]  In fact, most of the tomatoes or onions or watermelons you buy from the grocery store, they don't tell you, but they have Graphopper genes in them.
[00:11:07.983 --> 00:11:11.344]  Genes of all different types of animals and small creatures, mainly.
[00:11:12.524 --> 00:11:14.305]  Something you might want to be aware of.
[00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:24.336]  A lot of frightening things they have at their disposal, a lot of things that can help humanity, a lot of things that can hurt humanity, but mainly it's a huge, powerful force to subjugate entire human populations.
[00:11:26.478 --> 00:11:29.319]  Something we all need to be conscious of when we discuss that.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.062]  What's the bottom line of all this?
[00:11:33.142 --> 00:11:34.243]  Somebody has to talk.
[00:11:35.503 --> 00:11:36.744]  Somebody has to speak out.
[00:11:36.844 --> 00:11:41.167]  Somebody has to want to change what we're dealing with, what we're going up against.
[00:11:41.207 --> 00:11:42.388]  Somebody has to hearken.
[00:11:43.687 --> 00:11:53.010]  To history and give the warning call to Beavittown Criers and say that every single one of you out there counts.
[00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:57.211]  What you think and what you believe matters in the whole scheme of things.
[00:11:58.391 --> 00:11:59.752]  It is a group culture.
[00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:01.952]  It is a group collective.
[00:12:02.652 --> 00:12:03.853]  Whether you like it or not.
[00:12:04.393 --> 00:12:07.834]  And the enemies of freedom understand that paradigm.
[00:12:08.914 --> 00:12:12.195]  And until you take it in your hands
[00:12:14.058 --> 00:12:20.520]  To try to realize the threats to the human species by our own species, which is our greatest enemy.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.040]  Humans are the greatest threat to humans.
[00:12:23.661 --> 00:12:37.164]  Until you realize that and understand that the well-packaged lies of phony environmentalism, phony liberalism, phony conservatism, the phony libertarians, all the rest, the water tests
[00:12:37.898 --> 00:12:46.444]  The benchmark that you should tell people by is, are they for abolishing the Federal Reserve because it's private, run for profit, there are no reserves, it has never been audited.
[00:12:46.784 --> 00:12:47.625]  It cannot be audited.
[00:12:50.126 --> 00:13:05.477]  Are you speaking out against the know-your-customer information that's being rammed through the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation, where you like to sell out a huge FBI fact sheet about how much money you get, where you get it, before you can even have a bank account, then the FBI is going to monitor you.
[00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:18.523]  If somebody's not talking about the IRS, and how it's not been reformed, and how they're buying armored personnel carriers, and semi-automatic weapons, and all types of listing devices, and spy technologies.
[00:13:18.903 --> 00:13:26.865]  This isn't from me, this is from the Treasury website, who makes the purchases for the Federal Reserve Collection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, if you can call it that.
[00:13:29.747 --> 00:13:36.031]  If you don't talk about those things, if you waffle around and say we need some government and all the rest is garbage, you're an idiot.
[00:13:36.151 --> 00:13:37.452]  Of course we need some government.
[00:13:37.932 --> 00:13:42.192]  But the mere statement that you babble that off, the first thing you say, and you say
[00:13:42.192 --> 00:13:49.252]  that I am extreme, and that I do not have a good worldview, and that I am out of control,
[00:13:49.252 --> 00:13:54.292]  is, really speaks volumes to how decadently stupid you are.
[00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:58.812]  And I'm not talking to everybody out there, I'm just laying it out for you guys, power
[00:13:58.812 --> 00:14:03.412]  is mashing at the apex of centralized world government.
[00:14:03.412 --> 00:14:11.052]  This is not some stupid New World Order wrestling team on WWF, or whatever the hell it is.
[00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:15.451]  It's not all the diversions and the tabloids and all the rest of the crap.
[00:14:15.831 --> 00:14:16.791]  They're talking about it.
[00:14:17.031 --> 00:14:21.533]  Do you watch C-SPAN on a regular basis, governmental channels, and watch them?
[00:14:21.873 --> 00:14:23.194]  They're taking over our government.
[00:14:23.474 --> 00:14:28.936]  They created these unelected, unaccountable bureaucracies that now owe their allegiance to foreign nations.
[00:14:29.336 --> 00:14:30.917]  Later, I'm going to read an executive order.
[00:14:30.937 --> 00:14:33.698]  In fact, I'll do it now before I forget to get to this.
[00:14:37.259 --> 00:14:38.459]  This is an executive order.
[00:14:38.499 --> 00:14:39.460]  You can go to the Clinton
[00:14:40.765 --> 00:14:42.046]  Excuse me, the U.S.
[00:14:42.086 --> 00:14:43.767]  White House website, check this out.
[00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:49.152]  It is Executive Order 13,107.
[00:14:49.192 --> 00:14:55.997]  And it talks a real good game about human rights until you get down into Section 29 and below.
[00:14:56.678 --> 00:15:04.685]  Article 29 states that these rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.
[00:15:05.206 --> 00:15:10.851]  In other words, these rights or freedoms only go as far as if you speak for the UN and nobody else.
[00:15:11.831 --> 00:15:18.978]  They'll give you all these rights and then say, but if it's against our, what we're for, it's a global government, it's empire, it's Rome!
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.202]  You think a bunch of guys with handmade robes and spears and chariots can take over half the known world?
[00:15:26.242 --> 00:15:28.542]  Well, dammit guys, these people have taken over.
[00:15:29.443 --> 00:15:32.203]  And the European Union just went online this Monday.
[00:15:34.384 --> 00:15:38.705]  It actually went online over the weekend, but today is when it went online in actuality.
[00:15:38.765 --> 00:15:42.026]  I mean, you guys need to wake up and realize the threat we're dealing with.
[00:15:43.203 --> 00:15:45.084]  You need to find out what's really happening.
[00:15:45.624 --> 00:15:51.887]  I mean, my gentlemen, ladies, this is the most hardcore decision you are ever going to make in your life.
[00:15:52.367 --> 00:15:53.748]  We have had incredible wars
