[00:03:20.011 --> 00:03:22.812]  Mike, not to turn the camera back on when I'm putting my microphone on and stuff.
[00:03:24.973 --> 00:03:26.254]  Yeah, I know it's on, Mike.
[00:03:27.835 --> 00:03:28.515]  Yeah, I know that.
[00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:29.656]  That's why we've got to check Mike.
[00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:30.816]  I know he's at an earlier show.
[00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:32.917]  We've got to focus, man.
[00:03:33.157 --> 00:03:33.718]  We've got to focus.
[00:03:33.738 --> 00:03:35.278]  There's a lot of folks watching.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.800]  Say what? You got that?
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:04:09.800]  [Music]
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.800]  [Music]
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.004]  Mike, go ahead and back the intro up.
[00:04:17.044 --> 00:04:17.846]  I want to do this again.
[00:04:19.288 --> 00:04:21.288]  because I'm not good at it, you know?
[00:04:21.288 --> 00:04:23.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:23.288 --> 00:04:25.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:25.288 --> 00:04:27.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:27.288 --> 00:04:29.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:29.288 --> 00:04:31.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:31.288 --> 00:04:33.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:33.288 --> 00:04:35.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:35.288 --> 00:04:37.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:37.288 --> 00:04:39.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:39.288 --> 00:04:41.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:41.288 --> 00:04:43.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:43.288 --> 00:04:45.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:45.288 --> 00:04:47.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:47.288 --> 00:04:49.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:49.288 --> 00:04:51.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:51.288 --> 00:04:53.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:53.288 --> 00:04:55.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:55.288 --> 00:04:57.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:57.288 --> 00:04:59.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:04:59.288 --> 00:05:01.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:05:01.288 --> 00:05:03.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:05:03.288 --> 00:05:05.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:05:05.288 --> 00:05:07.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:05:07.288 --> 00:05:09.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:05:09.288 --> 00:05:11.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:05:11.288 --> 00:05:13.288]  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to give it a try.
[00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:17.710]  There are problems in our country, yes we live in troubled times.
[00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.451]  There are far too many criminals, and far too many crimes.
[00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:25.473]  I'm locking every window, and I'm poking every door.
[00:05:25.513 --> 00:05:28.774]  The tool I use is so potent, it'll even hurt the door.
[00:05:28.834 --> 00:05:32.434]  You can rent, you can rape, you can make your demands,
[00:05:32.434 --> 00:05:36.434]  and you can take my gun from my cold, dead hand.
[00:05:36.434 --> 00:05:40.434]  You can rent, you can rape, you can make your demands,
[00:05:40.434 --> 00:05:43.434]  and you can take my gun from my cold, dead hand.
[00:05:43.672 --> 00:05:48.116]  There are global corporations, they are billions that they pay.
[00:05:48.156 --> 00:05:51.478]  We're greedy politicians who make sure things go their way.
[00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:55.261]  They tax us into poverty, we live from day to day.
[00:05:55.342 --> 00:05:58.864]  Since then we're steeped in fear, we don't get to have a say.
[00:05:58.985 --> 00:06:02.728]  If you want to crack this constitution, is that what's in your plan?
[00:06:03.288 --> 00:06:06.689]  I'm going to take my gun from my cold, dead hand.
[00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:14.512]  In every case in history, when genocide has slammed, the firearms were gathered up and the opposition banned.
[00:06:14.572 --> 00:06:18.293]  The tyrants made distractions, and the people flew away.
[00:06:18.393 --> 00:06:27.937]  And by the time they realized they couldn't get away, the smiling face on my face said, we should all join hands and help create this vision of a new world.
[00:06:28.257 --> 00:06:29.938]  Alright, live television show.
[00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:31.258]  Oh, is the mic on now?
[00:06:31.358 --> 00:06:32.358]  Okay, just making sure.
[00:06:32.377 --> 00:06:44.997]  And you can take my gun from my cold, dead hand.
[00:06:44.997 --> 00:06:47.657]  Alright, live television show.
[00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:49.877]  Oh, is the mic on now?
[00:06:49.877 --> 00:06:51.557]  Okay, just making sure.
[00:06:51.557 --> 00:06:56.117]  Yeah, a lot of people worked hard to bring you all this important information.
[00:06:56.117 --> 00:06:58.117]  Fuck you.
[00:06:58.456 --> 00:06:59.257]  Doesn't really matter, though.
[00:06:59.277 --> 00:07:00.158]  I don't think anybody cares.
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.501]  President, yeah, this is InfoWars.
[00:07:05.222 --> 00:07:07.364]  Check out my website at InfoWars.com.
[00:07:08.625 --> 00:07:10.507]  Mike and the folks in there are doing a good job.
[00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:17.833]  We've got, uh... Mike, I just gotta do so much radio now, I'm just not even used to access TV.
[00:07:17.954 --> 00:07:19.235]  I know you do a great job.
[00:07:20.216 --> 00:07:22.398]  I just... What's the point?
[00:07:22.438 --> 00:07:23.799]  These people don't even care anyways.
[00:07:28.246 --> 00:07:29.007]  What's that, Mike?
[00:07:33.429 --> 00:07:34.950]  You are doing a good job, Mike!
[00:07:35.471 --> 00:07:36.952]  It's not that, I'm just tired.
[00:07:37.932 --> 00:07:39.573]  I'll tell you, this news is daunting.
[00:07:40.754 --> 00:07:45.937]  This amount of news is just, uh... Well, it's massive.
[00:07:47.218 --> 00:07:48.699]  Just to be completely honest about it.
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.341]  This is a lot of news.
[00:07:52.702 --> 00:07:54.563]  Clinton wanting to ban guns.
[00:07:54.583 --> 00:07:56.084]  It's coming out tomorrow, that.
[00:07:56.544 --> 00:07:57.625]  Something along those lines.
[00:07:58.973 --> 00:08:03.015]  We got news here, transcript of press conference from NATO.
[00:08:03.035 --> 00:08:08.058]  We got Insight Magazine, Chinese military moving into other bases.
[00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:15.803]  We got the Washington Times, they want to charge the parents of the Columbine NK Ultra provocateur killers.
[00:08:16.884 --> 00:08:20.506]  We got Serbia Info, mirroring what the NATO's saying.
[00:08:22.136 --> 00:08:23.137]  That's all incredible.
[00:08:23.417 --> 00:08:31.001]  But the first information we got is what happened with Vic Vreeland and Mike Hanson and everybody else out there today.
[00:08:33.942 --> 00:08:36.104]  This is some interesting footage you're about to see.
[00:08:38.365 --> 00:08:39.485]  It's pretty powerful.
[00:08:39.505 --> 00:08:40.786]  We'll be getting to that in a few minutes.
[00:08:42.587 --> 00:08:47.550]  This footage has to do with Joe Campana's house.
[00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.851]  Remember when we invoked that guy in Newhouse?
[00:08:51.045 --> 00:08:53.447]  And Joe just wanted to keep it back there for storage.
[00:08:54.167 --> 00:08:55.488]  The city said it was dangerous.
[00:08:56.989 --> 00:09:01.932]  Guests had their eye on representing the property, but the old house got bulldozed today.
[00:09:03.833 --> 00:09:07.835]  And Mike and all those fellows were out there taking care of business.
[00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:14.139]  And a bunch of other stuff, so.
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.921]  We got some footage of the bulldozer running over stuff for you.
[00:09:20.783 --> 00:09:21.724]  I find that interesting.
[00:09:24.285 --> 00:09:27.527]  And, uh... Oh, like I said, Clinton wants to ban guns.
[00:09:30.529 --> 00:09:32.290]  It'll get a lot worse than this before it ends.
[00:09:34.692 --> 00:09:36.733]  Hell, we'll be a lot safer without guns, won't we?
[00:09:36.773 --> 00:09:39.295]  Isn't that what we're all after?
[00:09:39.315 --> 00:09:44.858]  Isn't that what we're all headed for?
[00:09:44.878 --> 00:09:45.919]  Isn't that what we all want?
[00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:48.000]  Hell, we know history.
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.481]  We're a lot safer once that happens.
[00:09:51.107 --> 00:09:52.307]  You ready to go to that state?
[00:09:53.308 --> 00:09:55.028]  Yeah, let's go ahead and go to the state, and I'll be right back.
[00:09:55.168 --> 00:09:57.069]  This is, uh, them bulldozers in the house up there.
[00:09:57.089 --> 00:09:57.869]  It's pretty interesting footage.
[00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:00.510]  I actually watched it while I was on the radio during the break.
[00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.130]  Okay, mic still rolling.
[00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:07.131]  I'm trying to get the, uh, microphone, uh, underneath the umbrella, Mike.
[00:10:07.211 --> 00:10:08.912]  Under the umbrella.
[00:10:09.552 --> 00:10:10.052]  Here it goes.
[00:10:10.092 --> 00:10:12.173]  We're gonna take another, uh, scoop.
[00:10:12.553 --> 00:10:13.993]  Another scoop out of freedom.
[00:10:15.494 --> 00:10:16.894]  Another scoop out of freedom.
[00:10:16.934 --> 00:10:18.735]  Yeah, that's the flag still up.
[00:10:18.795 --> 00:10:20.195]  Reminds you a little bit of Waco.
[00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:23.484]  Uh, at least the BATF's not out here.
[00:10:23.524 --> 00:10:25.866]  There goes the whole thing.
[00:10:25.946 --> 00:10:28.649]  They're knocking Joe.
[00:10:28.749 --> 00:10:29.990]  How's Joe doing in the house?
[00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.732]  Is he in there alone?
[00:10:31.772 --> 00:10:33.734]  Yeah, there goes the, uh, Joe.
[00:10:33.754 --> 00:10:43.994]  Is he in there a long time? Yeah, there goes the, uh, that used to be a...
[00:10:44.059 --> 00:10:46.462]  Joe's Kitchen and the flag's still standing.
[00:10:46.602 --> 00:10:48.964]  I think that'll be the last thing to go.
[00:10:49.004 --> 00:10:50.986]  These people don't care.
[00:10:51.006 --> 00:10:53.228]  And now it's raining like hell.
[00:10:53.308 --> 00:10:58.374]  Isn't it interesting that the rain picks up as the demolitions pick up?
[00:11:01.204 --> 00:11:06.188]  God bless America and to hell with the salamanders and these salamander lovers.
[00:11:06.228 --> 00:11:15.495]  That'll spend $26,000 a piece to put in a salamander handrail that'll tear down an old man's house.
[00:11:15.535 --> 00:11:17.436]  These guys are a piece of trash.
[00:11:17.476 --> 00:11:19.438]  People are taking pictures in the background.
[00:11:21.484 --> 00:11:24.126]  We don't have any problem with A&R demolition.
[00:11:24.386 --> 00:11:25.387]  I can imagine.
[00:11:25.427 --> 00:11:38.576]  Yeah, what we understand is that they're going to donate their time to this because they realize what's happening.
[00:11:38.636 --> 00:11:40.997]  Maybe we'll find a million dollars.
[00:11:41.157 --> 00:11:42.218]  I don't know.
[00:11:42.278 --> 00:11:46.321]  Yeah, old Joe's next door in his house.
[00:11:50.402 --> 00:11:55.003]  No, I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna, uh, comment.
[00:11:55.163 --> 00:11:57.744]  Oh, I'm ready.
[00:11:58.064 --> 00:11:58.504]  I'm ready.
[00:11:58.564 --> 00:11:59.904]  People just need to watch it.
[00:11:59.944 --> 00:12:01.645]  There goes the whole house.
[00:12:01.745 --> 00:12:02.225]  It's moving.
[00:12:02.265 --> 00:12:04.225]  The whole house is shaking.
[00:12:04.505 --> 00:12:07.286]  And here comes a flag.
[00:12:07.346 --> 00:12:08.386]  Here comes a flag.
[00:12:08.666 --> 00:12:11.567]  Whoa, it's still standing!
[00:12:11.647 --> 00:12:12.587]  Yeah, look at that!
[00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:16.608]  The house has totally fell down, but the flag's still standing!
[00:12:19.368 --> 00:12:21.389]  God bless America!
[00:12:22.169 --> 00:12:24.230]  Lessons that I learned!
[00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:26.731]  Yeah, so much has changed.
[00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:28.551]  God bless the salamander, God.
[00:12:29.212 --> 00:12:32.013]  That's our new God, a little blind salamander.
[00:12:32.773 --> 00:12:38.935]  Yeah, I bet your city officials, they're frothing at the mouth over this.
[00:12:39.815 --> 00:12:40.575]  Yeah, old Joe.
[00:12:40.595 --> 00:12:41.876]  They can put up apartments here.
[00:12:41.976 --> 00:12:45.337]  Yeah, yeah, they can put up at least five row houses.
[00:12:46.277 --> 00:12:47.658]  Oh, the flag's still standing.
[00:12:49.827 --> 00:12:52.148]  Well, it's raining like hell out here.
[00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:56.769]  We got the lightning and we got the neighbors all out.
[00:12:56.789 --> 00:12:59.029]  I watch them knock down Joe's house.
[00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.290]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's your house next!
[00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:02.210]  Wake up!
[00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:06.892]  I can't believe we're witnessing this just because they don't like the looks of it.
[00:13:07.212 --> 00:13:10.552]  I've been in beer joints that look a whole lot worse than Joe's house.
[00:13:11.353 --> 00:13:13.053]  Boy, this thing's getting wet out here.
[00:13:13.733 --> 00:13:14.313]  Oh, not me.
[00:13:14.374 --> 00:13:15.814]  I'm worried about the microphone here.
[00:13:17.962 --> 00:13:18.743]  The flag's still standing.
[00:13:18.783 --> 00:13:19.763]  I hope he doesn't take it down.
[00:13:19.823 --> 00:13:30.269]  You're still getting, uh... Well, if he does, when they take it down, it's a, uh, a literal and symbolic gesture that, uh, liberty is good.
[00:13:30.289 --> 00:13:30.629]  Okay.
[00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.171]  Now look, the rain is at its height.
[00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:36.270]  The wind is out of sight.
[00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.270]  Oh, there it is.
[00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.270]  Let's see.
[00:13:40.627 --> 00:13:42.989]  Oh, that's the end of liberty?
[00:13:43.029 --> 00:13:46.352]  There's rain in this work?
[00:13:46.713 --> 00:13:47.193]  Oh!
[00:13:47.273 --> 00:13:49.515]  Boy, that's what they think of that flag.
[00:13:49.575 --> 00:13:53.318]  That's what they think.
[00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:56.361]  Now, that works out well.
[00:13:56.381 --> 00:13:57.502]  The rain is at its height?
[00:13:57.522 --> 00:14:00.544]  The rain is at its height?
[00:14:00.564 --> 00:14:01.625]  The flag is down.
[00:14:03.687 --> 00:14:07.812]  And so is Joe's house.
[00:14:07.932 --> 00:14:14.378]  You know, yeah, we believe the house was raggedy, but Joe should have had the right to keep it.
[00:14:14.398 --> 00:14:17.281]  You notice it hasn't fallen over on his neighbors.
[00:14:17.401 --> 00:14:20.044]  It hasn't gotten anything on his neighbors.
[00:14:20.144 --> 00:14:23.488]  Joe lived clean in the house, probably cleaner than most of us.
[00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:30.912]  He didn't swill beer and booze and smoke cigarettes.
[00:14:31.192 --> 00:14:32.513]  If you consider that bad.
[00:14:33.214 --> 00:14:36.336]  But he was a clean living, or he still is a clean living man.
[00:14:37.677 --> 00:14:40.420]  And he just wanted to be left alone in his own residence.
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:45.404]  So his residence now is gone and the water's leaking through onto the microphone.
[00:14:45.644 --> 00:14:46.224]  Whoa!
[00:14:46.245 --> 00:14:47.566]  Boy is that cold!
[00:14:47.826 --> 00:14:50.648]  Joe's inside mopping the floor.
[00:14:50.688 --> 00:14:52.330]  Joe's inside mopping the floor.
[00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.832]  Battery's not quite dead yet.
[00:14:56.052 --> 00:14:59.054]  So, we're getting an update on our battery.
[00:14:59.114 --> 00:15:01.795]  We'll probably lose a bunch of equipment here.
[00:15:02.816 --> 00:15:03.996]  Well, that's what we do for it.
[00:15:04.056 --> 00:15:04.337]  Yeah.
[00:15:04.997 --> 00:15:09.079]  So, uh... We'll be taking the... No, I can't say that on address.
[00:15:09.119 --> 00:15:11.801]  You don't know when the news meeting will start?
[00:15:11.881 --> 00:15:18.765]  Yeah, no news meeting showed up, and I'm sure the city... Yeah, I'm sure the city told them not to show up.
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.702]  I had to get under the umbrella here.
[00:15:20.741 --> 00:15:22.741]  I'm starting to drown!
[00:15:23.741 --> 00:15:25.741]  Are you filming this?
[00:15:25.741 --> 00:15:26.741]  Yeah.
[00:15:26.741 --> 00:15:27.741]  Go ahead.
[00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.912]  Well, yeah, here we are.
[00:15:29.932 --> 00:15:31.534]  The rain has subsided a little bit.
[00:15:31.594 --> 00:15:35.194]  It's interesting how the height of the rainstorm...
