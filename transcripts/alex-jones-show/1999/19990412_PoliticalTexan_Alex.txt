[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.160]  [Music]
[00:00:12.185 --> 00:00:14.928]  You are on the air!
[00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:16.310]  This is a test!
[00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.712]  What is a test?
[00:00:18.353 --> 00:00:23.799]  It's a test to see what it is that you can do!
[00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:30.627]  It's a test to see what it is that you can do!
[00:00:31.608 --> 00:00:41.608]  [Music]
[00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:51.608]  [Music]
[00:00:51.608 --> 00:01:01.608]  [Music]
[00:01:01.608 --> 00:01:11.608]  [Music]
[00:01:11.608 --> 00:01:19.608]  [Music]
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:44.200]  [Music]
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.200]  Boy, if I'm going to turn that iris up a bit.
[00:01:48.687 --> 00:01:49.627]  All right.
[00:01:50.347 --> 00:01:53.368]  You are watching Info Wars.
[00:01:53.428 --> 00:01:55.728]  Remember the good old days when I had time to set things up?
[00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:56.368]  Oh my goodness.
[00:01:56.388 --> 00:01:58.569]  Let's go ahead and go to the white shop, man.
[00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:59.429]  I can't stand that.
[00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.749]  We got Brent Johnson here with us tonight.
[00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:03.010]  How you doing, Brent?
[00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.870]  Just fine, Alex.
[00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.930]  Good to have you here.
[00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.370]  Of course, we do this little program.
[00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.631]  The only live program I really do anymore is come on somebody else's show on NAXA TV.
[00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:13.771]  It's right here every Monday night from 10.30 to 11.30.
[00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:15.292]  I'm on the radio from 8 to 10.
[00:02:17.111 --> 00:02:18.032]  I was little, sir.
[00:02:19.092 --> 00:02:33.261]  Yeah, and Brett Johnson, of course, is an expert on the criminal system of the Internal Revenue Service and how they're collecting taxes unconstitutionally.
[00:02:33.341 --> 00:02:36.503]  Now, it's a collection agency with a private run for private public reserve.
[00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:37.984]  We've now got bills in Congress.
[00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:42.727]  We're all sponsored here from Texas, District 14, south of Austin.
[00:02:43.027 --> 00:02:43.868]  Excellent, excellent
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.820]  And it's really fabulous news for everybody.
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.941]  H.R. 1148 to abolish the Federal Reserve, a lot of other news, Brent, and you've been
[00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:57.941]  doing quite a bit.
[00:02:57.941 --> 00:02:58.941]  In fact, this first one.
[00:02:58.941 --> 00:02:59.941]  Let's just go to some news.
[00:02:59.941 --> 00:03:00.941]  Sure.
[00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:01.941]  Please.
[00:03:01.941 --> 00:03:02.941]  I was scanning some of what you had there.
[00:03:02.941 --> 00:03:03.941]  Very important.
[00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:08.020]  Yeah, we got over two hours of stuff here, but we've got less than an hour now.
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.501]  Judge finds Clinton in contempt.
[00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:13.781]  U.S. Assistant Judge Susan Robert Wright found him in contempt, and Judge said the record
[00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:22.881]  It demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the President responded to plaintiff's
[00:03:22.881 --> 00:03:27.781]  questions by giving false, misleading, and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct
[00:03:27.781 --> 00:03:29.341]  the judicial process.
[00:03:30.378 --> 00:03:33.000]  So that's all very, very important there.
[00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.990]  I guess it won't matter if he's the king, is it?
[00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.171]  Well, you know, that's the point.
[00:03:40.251 --> 00:03:41.852]  Start looking at him as a dictator.
[00:03:42.072 --> 00:03:43.693]  Because you have a president who's a rapist.
[00:03:44.114 --> 00:03:46.735]  You have a president who's... You've got the contempt of court here.
[00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:51.098]  You've also got obstruction of justice on Hillary by Judge Royce Lambert.
[00:03:52.038 --> 00:03:54.760]  You've got, you know, the fundraising scandal.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.862]  You've got the dozens of people dead who have known this man.
[00:03:57.882 --> 00:04:04.206]  I mean, you know... At what point do you say he's no longer acting as a president, you know, he's acting as a dictator?
[00:04:05.226 --> 00:04:07.288]  That's what I call them on my own show.
[00:04:07.308 --> 00:04:08.429]  I call them dictator Clintons.
[00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:09.790]  But a loving dictator.
[00:04:10.891 --> 00:04:12.372]  Well, here I've got some Zoggy Polls.
[00:04:12.412 --> 00:04:14.354]  WorldNetDaily commissioned this.
[00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:21.400]  We're on Amazon's fabulous site.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.482]  And 73.6% of Democrats think the war over there is a great thing.
[00:04:24.882 --> 00:04:31.802]  And also the second largest number, 64.4 percent of people between 18 and 29 without high school
[00:04:31.802 --> 00:04:34.483]  education think it's also good.
[00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:47.218]  You know what drives me, if I may, what drives me absolutely crazy about Sosovo is that even the most so-called conservative media outlets, places like Fox News or polls like Zogby, are coming out with support.
[00:04:47.598 --> 00:04:53.521]  And I have to think that it's just nobody understands what happens when you violate a sovereign.
[00:04:53.901 --> 00:05:00.485]  The moment that you walk in and say for any reason that it's okay to invade a sovereign country, for any reason at all,
[00:05:01.377 --> 00:05:03.139]  Then who gets to determine?
[00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.623]  Well number one, we have to give people some history lessons.
[00:05:05.923 --> 00:05:12.912]  Up on my website, Info Wars, we got stories from around the world, from the mainstream press here, England, you name it.
[00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:15.015]  And guys, I'm here to tell you something right now.
[00:05:16.986 --> 00:05:25.991]  Osama Bin Laden, the CIA asset from the 80s, is in Albania right now, coordinating all these attacks in the past year and a half against the sovereign country.
[00:05:26.452 --> 00:05:29.694]  The refugee crisis was created by intense NACO bombing.
[00:05:30.014 --> 00:05:42.001]  In fact, in this poll, the Zogby poll, I would expect it compared to some of the others, 53.9% of those polled believe that the bombing of civilian infrastructure targets in Yugoslavia, this is water,
[00:05:43.021 --> 00:05:46.023]  Uh, water treatment and, uh, power supplies is justified.
[00:05:46.063 --> 00:05:51.247]  Only 35.2% didn't believe it was justified, while 10.9% were not sure.
[00:05:51.347 --> 00:05:52.368]  So... But why?
[00:05:52.448 --> 00:05:54.089]  Why do they think it's justified?
[00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.852]  Why do those people, who I believe are good people... They just go along, get along.
[00:05:57.872 --> 00:06:00.494]  ...because they've been told something's going on there?
[00:06:00.534 --> 00:06:04.156]  I mean, and it's an expert on TV that's, uh, that's a telegram.
[00:06:04.176 --> 00:06:05.197]  That's my point, Brent.
[00:06:05.678 --> 00:06:07.339]  I hardly agree with you on that analysis.
[00:06:08.082 --> 00:06:13.021]  Of course, we've got also the Times of India here from today.
[00:06:14.071 --> 00:06:20.612]  And they've tested their new intermediate range intercontinental ballistic missile with a 2,000 kilometer range.
[00:06:20.692 --> 00:06:23.013]  The Angie 3 is in development.
[00:06:23.053 --> 00:06:29.334]  They now say that we have reached a point where no one anywhere can threaten us, thanks to Clinton, allowing the transfers to China.
[00:06:29.354 --> 00:06:33.875]  They're now selling it to Iran, Pakistan, India, anybody else who wants to buy it.
[00:06:33.895 --> 00:06:35.435]  These protected technologies.
[00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:41.396]  Just a lot of bizarre and terrible things happening out there.
[00:06:42.546 --> 00:06:53.696]  I'll get your opinion of this, Greg, because you were raided by the IRS, and we'll talk about this later, a few months ago, but this is from the Denver Post here.
[00:06:53.876 --> 00:07:03.504]  An arsonist set fire to the local Internal Revenue Service office less than a week before Tax Day and two years after a similar fire in another IRS building in
[00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:05.867]  Denver.
[00:07:07.108 --> 00:07:11.571]  The fire broke out late Friday night inside the IRS building at 12,009 Lake Plaza Drive.
[00:07:11.651 --> 00:07:13.913]  It took 40 firefighters about an hour to bring the blade into control.
[00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:18.236]  The only injury was a fireman who suffered a strained knee.
[00:07:18.256 --> 00:07:22.619]  One office area of the building was burned, and the rest of the structures sustained heavy smoke and water damage.
[00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:25.200]  No records were destroyed.
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:33.246]  The building was heavily damaged by fire, said Richard Marcino, resident agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms in Colorado Springs.
[00:07:33.266 --> 00:07:35.167]  The IRS will have to find you another place to go.
[00:07:35.567 --> 00:07:39.770]  I'm not foreboding down this private institution that uses government employees.
[00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.611]  I'm certainly not because they need that.
[00:07:41.731 --> 00:07:46.234]  In fact, I would say 50% chance, this is speculation which I rarely do, that it was a government revocateur that did this.
[00:07:46.254 --> 00:07:47.134]  They're fully responsible.
[00:07:47.354 --> 00:07:49.395]  They enjoy that problem and the actual solution.
[00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:52.297]  But I mean, personally, I understand though, someone actually did this.
[00:07:52.317 --> 00:07:53.278]  I'm not saying it's a good thing.
[00:07:53.578 --> 00:08:00.282]  You know, I've seen my grandparents with heart attacks and sick and stuff, being attacked by the IRS, living in a South, in a modest South Boston home.
[00:08:00.742 --> 00:08:13.742]  we've done dozens of shows with old people like Bill Wheelis and others, you know, who all of a sudden are off for some reason, and it's like they have a ledger of people that have had serious illnesses and are over 70, they tell them they can just take their house and stick them in a nursing home and die of bedsores or whatever.
[00:08:13.742 --> 00:08:17.742]  My grandparents are still intelligent and sharp, they just have physical problems.
[00:08:17.742 --> 00:08:23.742]  You know, they're the criminals, and they're the terrorists, and they love these types of stories because it makes them look like they, you know, they're the terrorists, that's the right word.
[00:08:23.742 --> 00:08:37.741]  What would you think if a bunch of men, or maybe men and women, came into your shop or your store, your office, and said, "Give us your money or we're going to shut you down and take your property."
[00:08:38.473 --> 00:08:38.833]  What is that?
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.622]  Well, again, it's power corrupts and absolute power corrupts.
[00:08:44.902 --> 00:08:47.663]  Absolutely, people have accepted this and it's getting a lot worse.
[00:08:48.103 --> 00:09:01.550]  Before we get into information and where we're going to play, again, folks that have been asking for it, the footage of Mike Hanson three Saturdays ago being violated, and then live on the radio, and then it happened to one of Mike's employees, Derek Keel, one of Mike's employees in a little building business.
[00:09:03.584 --> 00:09:06.546]  Derek Keogh happened to him a lot on the Shannon Burke Show, all on the same stage.
[00:09:06.566 --> 00:09:08.387]  Yeah, but I was in the studio when it happened.
[00:09:08.407 --> 00:09:09.188]  You were out in the air.
[00:09:09.268 --> 00:09:10.048]  I was right there.
[00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:20.155]  And so, we've had two incidents that went out on commercial FM radio on 98.9 KJFK in the last three and a half weeks, so a lot of funny stuff happened.
[00:09:20.195 --> 00:09:32.163]  This is, I'll tell you, the third incident, because just before I came out to Texas over the last week, I get a call from somebody in Killeen, and this is a woman, a Mormon, who has loads of children.
[00:09:32.182 --> 00:09:38.023]  one of them is in the car, and she gets stopped by a DPS, Department of Public Safety's female
[00:09:38.023 --> 00:09:42.523]  officer, and she'd attended one of my seminars, and she'd learned how to deal with them, so
[00:09:42.523 --> 00:09:47.182]  she asked for the officer's identification, and the officer didn't like that, but ultimately
[00:09:47.182 --> 00:09:51.742]  jays her the ID, and then asks her for her ID, she asks her probable cause.
[00:09:51.741 --> 00:09:57.741]  The officer refused to answer because she refused to identify herself, so the officer threatened to take her child.
[00:09:57.778 --> 00:10:01.040]  The officer said, if you don't ID yourself, I'm going to take your child.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.801]  She stood her ground!
[00:10:03.141 --> 00:10:03.701]  Bless her!
[00:10:03.962 --> 00:10:07.824]  She stood her ground, said, you're not taking my child, and I'm not IDing myself without probable cause.
[00:10:08.164 --> 00:10:15.728]  They got like half a dozen cops around, a supervisor came in, and finally, when the supervisor came in and she told them the problem, he said, oh, here's the probable cause.
[00:10:15.768 --> 00:10:17.129]  He said, okay, here's my ID.
[00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:17.630]  Well...
[00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:23.593]  But the idea that you have these people, I'll take your child if you don't identify me?
[00:10:23.833 --> 00:10:33.659]  Well, exactly, and it's just a horrifying thing that they have what they call now Janet Reno saying it may be a little too harsh, aggressive profiling.
[00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:43.986]  A lot of black people call it driving while black, or driving in certain areas is called driving while black, and my community makes kind of a joke out of it, which is, it isn't funny in my opinion, but there are other guys that have really been going through it.
[00:10:44.606 --> 00:10:48.028]  That if you just look a certain way, they're going to search your vehicle.
[00:10:48.048 --> 00:10:52.789]  Now the Supreme Court last Monday ruled that they can search people, all their belongings, inside the car.
[00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.470]  And he's just expanding that.
[00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.511]  That's because the Supreme Court statute doesn't make it so.
[00:10:57.571 --> 00:11:02.834]  The Supreme Court does not make law, and Congress does not make law that affects the rest of us in the 15 days.
[00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:06.155]  And it's up to jurors in a court case to decide.
[00:11:06.515 --> 00:11:10.797]  And I just want to appeal to the police out there, that are peace officers,
[00:11:11.557 --> 00:11:17.742]  And I want to appeal to you and say, my gosh, fellas, you know, there are real criminals out there to deal with.
[00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:26.249]  I know you've been turning loose on us to generate for a $37,000 a year job over $200,000 a year for your average Metro police type officer.
[00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:31.234]  So we're asking you to, I know in the past you were given collars for busting criminals.
[00:11:31.294 --> 00:11:36.658]  Now the judicial system left out the violent people, the mcduffs of the world, taking murder again, or the
[00:11:38.459 --> 00:11:40.221]  Or the other child molesters and killers.
[00:11:40.261 --> 00:11:42.483]  We've done many examples of this here.
[00:11:42.503 --> 00:11:45.145]  I mean, we understand this and we understand what's happening.
[00:11:45.226 --> 00:11:47.748]  We're calling out to you against this evil.
[00:11:47.948 --> 00:11:51.532]  See, the evil people of the world want to control the population.
[00:11:51.592 --> 00:12:02.442]  They want to feed upon the hard-working people because they know we're productive and they want to train us to accept that in a women-like manner so we can be their little aphids down in the ant hive.
[00:12:02.762 --> 00:12:03.963]  I'm going to ask you a question.
[00:12:04.063 --> 00:12:22.840]  About a month and a half ago, and it's becoming a big topic on talk radio, about a month and a half ago, the American Psychological Society, made up of psychologists, I'm certainly not saying that all psychologists believe this or go along with this, but the American Psychological Society, Brent, I'm sure you're aware of this, I heard you talk about it on your radio show, they came out and they said, well, you know,
[00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:28.661]  It's not always abuse if it's an adult and even a small child having sex.
[00:12:28.861 --> 00:12:32.362]  Now, if they're putting this on paper, imagine what some of them are really thinking.
[00:12:32.382 --> 00:12:33.442]  And I've been researching this.
[00:12:33.763 --> 00:12:35.363]  This is truly degenerate and evil.
[00:12:35.383 --> 00:12:37.464]  I mean, this is like Babylonian times.
[00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:42.786]  How would you view this then for the public and explain it about these parasites that would have us displaced?
[00:12:43.426 --> 00:12:46.749]  Well, basically I would say, who gets to determine how you live?
[00:12:46.769 --> 00:12:49.392]  Who gets to determine what is morally bad?
[00:12:49.752 --> 00:12:55.097]  Is it an elected official, a non-elected official, or the parents of the children?
[00:12:55.658 --> 00:12:57.560]  And it's really, to me it's very simple.
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.603]  Your rights come from a higher source than government.
[00:13:01.003 --> 00:13:05.207]  Therefore, if government tries to encroach upon your rights, you have every right to
[00:13:05.486 --> 00:13:07.486]  It's your right to defend yourself.
[00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:09.486]  The police try and knock at your window.
[00:13:09.486 --> 00:13:12.486]  You have every right to fight back.
[00:13:12.486 --> 00:13:15.486]  Because your freedom is a prize that's worth a lot.
[00:13:15.486 --> 00:13:18.486]  Well, whoever sold these police, they're better than us, you know?
[00:13:18.486 --> 00:13:21.486]  If somebody shoots a police officer...
[00:13:22.089 --> 00:13:30.215]  I want them in the bottom of the jail for the rest of their life, and if the people of the show deemed it to be constitutional, I want them to be put to death after they've had some appeals.
[00:13:30.495 --> 00:13:34.478]  But if a police officer shoots a person, the same thing should apply.
[00:13:34.558 --> 00:13:39.902]  Now, if I'm not lazy, and I get so many stories to me written just like you do every day, and hundreds of factions, and you name it.
[00:13:40.583 --> 00:13:42.845]  I was talking to somebody I've known for a long time.
[00:13:43.786 --> 00:13:44.687]  Did I work where?
[00:13:44.927 --> 00:14:06.926]  And they are involved in a business with somebody, who at the business was making a delivery and saw the gentleman a couple of months ago, I forget his name now, he's not with us today, who saw him running from the police, he's mentally retarded, after a former head injury, large fellow, he was running with his mother, he was running when he heard sirens that scared him, or the fire trucks that pulled by, and he ran and people saw him running.
[00:14:06.946 --> 00:14:08.907]  When the police saw him running, they yelled, stop!
[00:14:08.987 --> 00:14:10.949]  When he didn't stop, they pumped the rounds into him.
[00:14:12.174 --> 00:14:13.595]  Uh, and this goes along with it.
[00:14:13.615 --> 00:14:22.117]  Pedro Oregon, involved in community politics, captain of the Little League soccer team, or just coach of the Little League soccer team.
[00:14:22.157 --> 00:14:24.998]  He was shot 12 times in the back, went to the wrong house.
[00:14:25.078 --> 00:14:29.660]  And the guy in New York who was shot 41 times, the black guy at arms, guy's 41.
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:34.721]  What about the guy before that who was shot and martyred brutally by a toilet plunger in New York?
[00:14:34.821 --> 00:14:37.462]  And then the Rudolph Giuliani comes out and says, don't bash the police.
[00:14:37.622 --> 00:14:38.402]  I'm not bashing the police.
[00:14:38.422 --> 00:14:39.703]  I have a lot of friends that are police.
[00:14:39.783 --> 00:14:40.463]  But, you know.
[00:14:40.903 --> 00:14:50.189]  But what we're saying to the other thugs that are being hired in the system, that's telling them it's okay, is that we, if a police officer is shot and killed or injured, we want the people prosecuted.
[00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:56.153]  But all the time, you see many examples of people that kill, let's say, three adolescents, like McDuff.
[00:14:56.173 --> 00:14:56.794]  He's a good example.
[00:14:56.814 --> 00:14:57.594]  There's been many others.
[00:14:58.795 --> 00:15:00.757]  Killed three people and is released 14 years later.
[00:15:00.777 --> 00:15:00.877]  Now,
[00:15:03.578 --> 00:15:05.919]  This is the FBI's own statistics, which they're very proud of.
[00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:08.440]  They try to even puff these up.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.182]  10% of the time, if you commit a murder, you are caught and convicted.
[00:15:13.202 --> 00:15:22.426]  70%, now that's a non, if it's a murder of a non-federal person or a law enforcement officer, one of the king's men, just like in England.
[00:15:22.446 --> 00:15:26.507]  10% of the time, if it's just a general citizen, do they catch the perpetrators.
[00:15:26.767 --> 00:15:28.088]  That's something we all need to be conscious of.
[00:15:28.108 --> 00:15:29.288]  You're not better than me.
[00:15:29.608 --> 00:15:30.689]  I want you to know that out there.
[00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:31.989]  You're not better than me.
[00:15:33.826 --> 00:15:34.927]  You know it's a sad thing.
[00:15:35.248 --> 00:15:38.491]  Well you know in any walk of life there are good people there are bad people.
[00:15:38.952 --> 00:15:43.457]  Just because you put on a badge doesn't make you good and just because you put on a badge doesn't make you bad.
[00:15:43.957 --> 00:15:47.201]  If you're a bad person you put on a badge you're going to be a bad cop.
[00:15:47.561 --> 00:15:48.943]  It's really as simple as that.
[00:15:49.163 --> 00:15:52.507]  So a badge doesn't suddenly mean that you deserve respect.
[00:15:52.967 --> 00:15:53.848]  Okay a badge means you
