[00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:14.858]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:18.440]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:22.452 --> 00:00:24.134]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:27.418]  We're going to be here for the next hour and 51 minutes.
[00:00:27.438 --> 00:00:30.841]  The last hour and 51 minutes of the radio show today.
[00:00:31.262 --> 00:00:33.905]  Simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:34.405 --> 00:00:42.535]  I am coming to you from deep behind enemy lines with a mesmerized, hypnotized, brainwashed population beginning to wake up that we are in the middle of the eugenics wars.
[00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.114]  That's what this will be known of in history if we're able to turn this around and defeat it.
[00:00:47.494 --> 00:00:59.786]  How a global group of scientists with private banks who believe in eugenics got control of society, how they're carrying these operations out against all of us, except for a few thousand top globalists in their think tanks and their operational systems.
[00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:00.687]  Less than 10,000 total.
[00:01:02.648 --> 00:01:08.353]  We just played you clip after clip of people dying and dead and dying from the Gardasil HPV shot alone.
[00:01:09.054 --> 00:01:16.560]  This is a government who admittedly grabbed 4,000 plus foster kids and radiated them to death and paid Israel to radiate 110,000 Google ringworm children.
[00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:18.022]  Mainstream news in Israel.
[00:01:19.244 --> 00:01:25.108]  These are the government that, you know, test chemical, biological, radiologicals on troops, killing them in many cases.
[00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:27.009]  Tuskegee experiment, all of that.
[00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:37.337]  Now, they know that most major vaccines have cancer viruses in them, not just HV40 and, you know, the simian virus, SV40 and other things.
[00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:44.495]  They know that autism and cancer is up just thousands of percentile points across the board.
[00:01:45.116 --> 00:01:48.300]  They know that they're now having people at 25 get Alzheimer's.
[00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:55.028]  We're being hit by multiple targets and multiple angles.
[00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:58.533]  And we got Rebecca Estep on with us.
[00:02:00.316 --> 00:02:03.319]  She is the national manager of the TACA.
[00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:05.081]  Talk about curing autism, what that stands for.
[00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:09.786]  A mother of a child who had a reaction to vaccines, was later diagnosed with autism.
[00:02:10.326 --> 00:02:11.828]  And I just see it every day in the news.
[00:02:11.928 --> 00:02:13.450]  People dying after the shots.
[00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.453]  Not just having convulsions, but dying.
[00:02:17.094 --> 00:02:18.976]  And if you think that the
[00:02:21.368 --> 00:02:25.290]  Shots are bad, like MMR, that's caused a scourge globally.
[00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.712]  It doesn't hold a candle to Factor VIII, which is admittedly filled with HIV and Hepatitis.
[00:02:30.732 --> 00:02:32.433]  So don't believe me, just Google Factor VIII.
[00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:37.796]  And they just announce it calmly, oh yeah, we shipped it all over the world.
[00:02:39.296 --> 00:02:42.098]  And then you expand out from there with the Gardasil.
[00:02:43.658 --> 00:02:45.699]  Folks, you better grow up, you better face the horror.
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.961]  Rebecca Estep, thank you for coming on the show with us today.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.041]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[00:02:52.061 --> 00:03:00.184]  Tell folks about your organization, and there's a massive awakening happening to autism, but then there's all these other scourges going on.
[00:03:01.705 --> 00:03:02.065]  Right.
[00:03:02.185 --> 00:03:07.347]  Well, TACA, Talk About Caring Autism, is a parent support group.
[00:03:07.707 --> 00:03:09.768]  It's incredibly grassroots.
[00:03:10.608 --> 00:03:18.091]  Most of us met each other on the internet, and we all pretty much were from Southern California when our children
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:27.765]  We're diagnosed with autism and we realized there was little to nothing for our children to help them get better.
[00:03:28.726 --> 00:03:39.012]  We were, you know, this was the year 2000 and I was told that I would need to put my two-year-old in an institution at some point and I thought, wow, you know, how can this be?
[00:03:39.672 --> 00:03:47.417]  There really must be more out there and a few of us parents just started doing a lot of research and found that there are a lot of things
[00:03:48.018 --> 00:03:51.040]  Yes, I have had countless medical doctors on, brain surgeons, you name it, and
[00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:25.689]  In the 80s, they started giving the MMR shot earlier and earlier, as you know, and the children would have convulsions, sometimes in the hospital, and that was always kind of a blessing in disguise, because they wouldn't SWAT team the mother or father, saying they'd shaken the baby, because there would be blood on the brain from the autoimmune response.
[00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:33.294]  Generally, it would happen when baby went to sleep at night, after the third round of shots, and then the autism, after they come out of the two-day coma.
[00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:37.264]  Well, wow, it sounds like you've done a lot of research.
[00:04:37.284 --> 00:04:37.344]  Yes.
[00:04:37.364 --> 00:04:38.325]  It's not just the mercury.
[00:04:38.365 --> 00:04:40.888]  This problem is so complicated and that's what's really
[00:04:57.912 --> 00:04:59.113]  I don't know.
[00:05:16.818 --> 00:05:23.480]  Additives like mercury and aluminum and formaldehyde, all of these toxins that are not supposed to be in your body to begin with.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.561]  Yeah, and that's bad, but I learned that from the scientists I've talked to, that that's itself almost a red herring.
[00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:33.322]  It's the genetic pathogen that you're supposedly being given the immunity to.
[00:05:33.862 --> 00:05:35.303]  It's passing the blood-brain barrier.
[00:05:35.343 --> 00:05:39.364]  It's causing a massive autoimmune response in all major organs.
[00:05:39.924 --> 00:05:49.452]  And it's that inflammation that then becomes chronic inflammation of the brain that is what's causing the autism, centering in and around the cerebral cortex, the left and right lobe.
[00:05:50.352 --> 00:05:54.216]  That's, again, you have a really sophisticated understanding.
[00:05:54.776 --> 00:05:55.036]  Right.
[00:05:55.416 --> 00:05:59.400]  So we don't know, I mean, what, it kind of seems like a one-two punch.
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.624]  You give an infant that's, their immune system is not developed yet.
[00:06:05.054 --> 00:06:29.743]  These toxins which does something to their immune system and then on one day these infants are getting anywhere between you know six and twelve viruses injected straight into their body and in nature we would never be exposed to you know you're supposed to be exposed to maybe one or two viruses and then your body overcomes it and then you have immunity but what are we doing we're giving these children
[00:06:30.576 --> 00:06:31.377]  We're good to go.
[00:06:48.872 --> 00:06:53.613]  I'll agree that maybe he doesn't have the ability to detoxify, like some people.
[00:06:53.653 --> 00:06:54.753]  Yeah, well that's what they say.
[00:06:54.794 --> 00:06:58.494]  When your child, and they find out they're toxic from all these shots, they say, oh, your child's a problem.
[00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:11.158]  Here in Texas, they testified before the legislature, the omnibusman for the legislature, the state scientific advisor, got up and said, we give 67% of school children
[00:07:13.931 --> 00:07:33.618]  uh... that are in our custody uh... foster children psychotropic drugs and and representative susannah upset why he said they have defective genes they're subhuman now from now that now that's what they're really talking about behind the scenes he is we're doing this to them because they deserve it
[00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:37.651]  Okay, so see, there's a whole other level of horror, ma'am.
[00:07:37.671 --> 00:07:38.611]  I don't know if you're aware of it.
[00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:41.352]  That's why we're having influential folks on to tell them about this.
[00:07:42.053 --> 00:07:43.993]  Are you familiar with the Nazis and eugenics?
[00:07:45.554 --> 00:07:46.375]  I'm not.
[00:07:46.515 --> 00:07:49.116]  I mean, you know, just a rudimentary understanding.
[00:07:49.176 --> 00:07:55.239]  But what I'm afraid of doing, it's kind of like capitalism gone a little wild.
[00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:57.940]  Like, well, we can produce this product.
[00:07:58.601 --> 00:08:01.584]  And we can make money from it, so why don't we do it?
[00:08:01.844 --> 00:08:08.951]  Well, did you read the Bayer documents on Factor VIII where they knew it all had HIV and Hepatitis and shipped it out to over a million dosages?
[00:08:09.612 --> 00:08:12.475]  I am unfamiliar with that document, sorry.
[00:08:12.535 --> 00:08:16.399]  Even MSNBC's covered it, but just so you know, it's even worse, ma'am.
[00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:21.444]  But look, side issue, tell us about how you woke up, what happened with your child, and where this is all going.
[00:08:22.318 --> 00:08:26.840]  Well, I can't get too specific because we do have a case in federal court.
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.201]  We're in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.
[00:08:30.702 --> 00:08:33.863]  But basically, it's the story that I've heard.
[00:08:33.983 --> 00:08:37.565]  And you know, we have over 10,000 families in TACA.
[00:08:38.125 --> 00:08:41.586]  And for years, I answered the parent support line.
[00:08:41.966 --> 00:08:44.528]  And it's the same story you hear over and over again.
[00:08:44.548 --> 00:08:45.868]  Now, tell them that story.
[00:08:46.348 --> 00:08:46.668]  Sure.
[00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:49.510]  I had a very typical developing child.
[00:08:50.962 --> 00:08:59.265]  We got, you know, I get accused all the time of being anti-vaccine and I said, I'd say to these people, how am I anti-vaccine?
[00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:00.646]  I had my child vaccinated.
[00:09:00.666 --> 00:09:01.926]  He has a vaccine injury.
[00:09:02.046 --> 00:09:08.329]  You know, I didn't start out this way, but he was developing typically hit all of his milestones.
[00:09:08.889 --> 00:09:15.131]  And then one day he had a vaccine reaction, which looked a little different than I would have thought.
[00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:19.493]  I thought a vaccine reaction is kind of like an anaphylactic type thing or a seizure thing.
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:25.943]  Well, what happened with him is he had this intense gastrointestinal diarrhea episode.
[00:09:26.643 --> 00:09:34.086]  And further, you know, doing research now, I know that most of your immune system is in your GI tract.
[00:09:35.725 --> 00:09:59.322]  The body was saying get it out get it out emergency and of course you know Crohn's didn't exist until 45 years ago and in all the major Crohn's tests they find the antibodies from the measles vaccines and other things in the gut and so there's a huge ongoing battle and then so your guts just shut down in the ongoing battle and so everybody out there that's got Crohn's and other gifts from the government but go ahead.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:08.754]  Well right, so we had this horrible diarrhea episode and then after that this baby who was never sick was sick constantly.
[00:10:08.854 --> 00:10:10.056]  I could not keep him.
[00:10:10.851 --> 00:10:16.514]  Um, well, for anything, and he had the worst case of hand, foot, and mouth disease they ever saw.
[00:10:16.734 --> 00:10:17.355]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:10:17.435 --> 00:10:18.695]  I mean, let's be clear about this.
[00:10:18.995 --> 00:10:28.160]  Most of these autistic children that were 1 in 25,000 20 years ago, now 1 in 86, and 2 years ago was 1 in 168, so it's intensifying.
[00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:33.503]  They don't just have the mental issues where they're, you know, I can't focus.
[00:10:33.643 --> 00:10:35.985]  It's, they have bowel problems, all of this.
[00:10:36.625 --> 00:10:39.707]  It is an overall sickness in the entire body.
[00:10:39.727 --> 00:10:40.027]  Go ahead.
[00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:48.511]  Right, and that is the part that drives us crazy is that, you know, your mainstream doctors will tell you, oh, you have a child with autism and they have diarrhea.
[00:10:48.531 --> 00:10:50.352]  Well, that just kind of goes along with autism.
[00:10:50.412 --> 00:10:53.554]  And we are like, all the parents are saying, wait, time out.
[00:10:54.094 --> 00:10:54.994]  They've done it!
[00:10:55.015 --> 00:10:56.976]  They're never going to admit what they did!
[00:10:56.996 --> 00:11:00.698]  Again, the doctors have cognitive dissonance themselves.
[00:11:00.758 --> 00:11:02.979]  They can't believe they're part of this.
[00:11:03.019 --> 00:11:03.680]  They don't understand.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.482]  They're just like a clerk carrying out what the franchise owners are doing.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:19.086]  I actually usually never get very upset at the doctors, because like you said, they're just listening to the people, their bosses, and they honestly think that they haven't done anything wrong.
[00:11:20.767 --> 00:11:25.930]  I kind of leave them alone, except for, you know, sometimes they have a little bit of arrogance.
[00:11:28.767 --> 00:11:31.628]  Until their kids end up in a pine box.
[00:11:32.388 --> 00:11:46.251]  Well, actually it's very interesting because there is a movement called Defeat Autism Now, which treats these children's whole bodies and we're filled with doctors who become Defeat Autism Now doctors because their children develop autism.
[00:11:46.511 --> 00:11:50.892]  And once you see it in front of your face, you cannot deny what happened to your child.
[00:11:50.912 --> 00:11:51.152]  That's right.
[00:11:51.172 --> 00:11:52.292]  Yeah, the doctor does this to their kid.
[00:11:53.558 --> 00:11:56.082]  And they go, whoa, whoa, this stuff's real.
[00:11:56.543 --> 00:11:57.645]  They care about their kids.
[00:11:57.665 --> 00:11:58.046]  That's right.
[00:11:58.286 --> 00:12:00.089]  You care about your own flesh, you'll wake up.
[00:12:00.129 --> 00:12:01.051]  Ma'am, stay there.
[00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:02.934]  I'll talk more about your organization when we get back.
[00:12:03.195 --> 00:12:04.717]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:12:08.698 --> 00:12:10.680]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:17.026]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?
[00:12:17.286 --> 00:12:21.209]  Stop guessing and go to the expert, Robert Chapman of The International Forecaster.

[00:12:45.282 --> 00:12:46.243]  We're good to go.
[00:13:07.463 --> 00:13:12.768]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:13:13.268 --> 00:13:20.275]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:13:20.851 --> 00:13:27.037]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:13:27.437 --> 00:13:29.259]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:13:29.419 --> 00:13:31.821]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:13:31.921 --> 00:13:42.871]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:13:43.492 --> 00:13:44.793]  It's not about left or right.
[00:13:45.174 --> 00:13:46.535]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:13:47.006 --> 00:13:53.353]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:13:53.914 --> 00:14:01.703]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:14:02.183 --> 00:14:03.345]  The Obama Deception.
[00:14:03.765 --> 00:14:04.967]  The people strike back.
[00:14:06.653 --> 00:14:08.514]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.
[00:14:08.835 --> 00:14:15.720]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource on earth because it will provide healthy food now and every year after.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:22.825]  Survivalistseeds.com now has the heirloom garden seed time capsule, allowing you to store your seeds for the future anywhere, even underground.
[00:14:22.845 --> 00:14:35.794]  For 100 years, the heirloom garden seed time capsule can withstand three tons of weight, is 100% rodent-proof, waterproof, and comes with a whopping 6,000 healthy vegetable seeds from 20 varieties that will grow anywhere in the USA, unless you try
[00:14:35.794 --> 00:14:36.054]  I'm good.
[00:15:06.595 --> 00:15:10.557]  If you have over $10,000 in credit card debt, you need to hear this.
[00:15:10.817 --> 00:15:15.460]  Have you been watching the banks getting their bailout money and wondering where your relief is?
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.162]  The answer you're looking for is the bailout group.
[00:15:18.302 --> 00:15:23.565]  The bailout group has settled over $100 million in credit card debt for people just like you.
[00:15:23.865 --> 00:15:32.651]  The bailout group can help cut your debt by up to 60% of its original value, removing those high interest fees and rolling everything into one low monthly payment.
[00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:33.111]  We're good to go.
[00:16:02.842 --> 00:16:09.686]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:16:10.226 --> 00:16:13.108]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:16:20.413 --> 00:16:25.256]  We had a caller earlier who brought up this FEMA drill.
[00:16:25.336 --> 00:16:27.777]  It turned out Burma was covered over three hours last night.
[00:16:27.797 --> 00:16:28.538]  I didn't know that.
[00:16:29.434 --> 00:16:30.655]  I knew that these drills were coming up.
[00:16:30.735 --> 00:16:32.396]  I hadn't really looked at them because there's just so many.
[00:16:32.416 --> 00:16:33.137]  I get conditioned.
[00:16:33.237 --> 00:16:36.480]  It's Foreign Troops Takeover Drill of the U.S.
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:37.981]  Here it is from FEMA.
[00:16:38.401 --> 00:16:40.203]  National Level Exercise 2009.
[00:16:40.243 --> 00:16:42.104]  N-L-E-O-9.
[00:16:42.425 --> 00:16:45.988]  You know, in Germany, after they found out what Hitler had done, people couldn't believe it.
[00:16:46.028 --> 00:16:46.989]  Germans couldn't believe it.
[00:16:47.369 --> 00:16:50.231]  They were in denial because they had been under the spell.
[00:16:50.271 --> 00:16:52.253]  They couldn't believe things that bad were going on.
[00:16:52.773 --> 00:16:53.654]  It's the same thing here.
[00:16:55.410 --> 00:17:01.638]  Going back to Rebecca Estep and we've got the website TACA.com.
[00:17:01.879 --> 00:17:03.380]  Now I'm sorry I'm ranting at you.
[00:17:03.721 --> 00:17:09.328]  I just have three children and it freaks me out fundamentally and I'm an aggressive guy and I just
[00:17:10.325 --> 00:17:12.526]  I don't have the spell on me to accept this.
[00:17:12.686 --> 00:17:14.087]  And I know you've probably gone through a lot of anger.
[00:17:14.147 --> 00:17:16.768]  This actually happened to your son.
[00:17:17.608 --> 00:17:21.450]  But, yeah, go through what happens to the... I mean, and they do this to the children.
[00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:26.853]  All the studies show it's happening, and then they rationalize it and put out media reports saying it isn't true.
[00:17:26.873 --> 00:17:32.575]  But isn't the biggest issue how they lie and say it's the law, you've got to take all these shots, when it isn't the law?
[00:17:32.875 --> 00:17:37.678]  The law is they've got to present you with a waiver, but the way...
[00:17:38.718 --> 00:17:39.418]  It's just incredible.
[00:17:39.498 --> 00:17:40.679]  I mean, are we free or not?
[00:17:42.099 --> 00:17:48.500]  Well, 48 out of 50 states have vaccine waiver laws.
[00:17:49.121 --> 00:17:52.281]  If you're in Mississippi or West Virginia, you got problems.
[00:17:53.022 --> 00:17:53.882]  But it is true.
[00:17:54.782 --> 00:18:00.463]  School districts will have you believe that your child must be fully vaccinated in order to attend school.
[00:18:00.944 --> 00:18:03.064]  But I live in California.
[00:18:03.464 --> 00:18:06.825]  The form that you have to fill out to have your child in school
[00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.892]  All you have to do is flip it over and sign the waiver.
[00:18:10.333 --> 00:18:15.056]  It's a health department document, which again was set up by the eugenicists 90 years ago in the U.S.
[00:18:15.357 --> 00:18:16.197]  Cold Springs Harbor.
[00:18:16.217 --> 00:18:18.139]  That's what, for those that don't know, this whole system is.
[00:18:18.959 --> 00:18:21.281]  And that's why Rick Perry said you've got to take HPV.
[00:18:21.341 --> 00:18:26.025]  He just ordered health department to make it the list of mandatory shots to be in school.
[00:18:26.385 --> 00:18:28.227]  So it's all a corporate fraud trick.
[00:18:28.267 --> 00:18:28.607]  Go ahead.
[00:18:29.588 --> 00:18:35.813]  Well, what I worry about is all of a sudden, you know, we have a hammer and everything looks like a nail.
[00:18:37.697 --> 00:18:40.558]  I'm not saying all vaccines are bad.
[00:18:41.258 --> 00:18:51.082]  I don't want polio coming back, but the thought that one size fits all is ridiculous, especially when it comes to a medical procedure.
[00:18:51.842 --> 00:18:57.184]  There is this feeling out there in the media that 100% of the vaccines 100% of the time are safe for 100% of the people.
[00:19:01.471 --> 00:19:05.374]  That's just wrong, or there wouldn't be this vaccine injury compensation program.
[00:19:05.474 --> 00:19:07.716]  We know that some things are going to happen.
[00:19:08.277 --> 00:19:20.066]  And yet, when we bring up these, you know, red flags, like our kids started to get sick within hours or days or a couple of weeks of being vaccinated, they kind of tell us, oh, you know, no way.
[00:19:20.747 --> 00:19:21.688]  And, you know,
[00:19:22.677 --> 00:19:29.022]  To me, I don't understand why they're not listening to these parents who are telling the same story.
[00:19:29.062 --> 00:19:33.686]  Well, ma'am, I'm sure you know Nobel Prize winners say that this is all a eugenics operation.
[00:19:33.706 --> 00:19:34.627]  You really never heard that?
[00:19:34.667 --> 00:19:51.200]  You don't hear about all these countries where everybody in Africa and Asia literally run, even though they're offering them UN money to take the shots, they run into the jungles and into the woods and into the hills and they now pay military's bounties to hunt people down and literally net them and inject them and then they suddenly get HIV and are sterilized.
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:51.981]  You haven't heard about that?
[00:19:53.078 --> 00:19:58.721]  I've heard some things, but what I've had to have done is just focus my efforts on the United States.
[00:19:58.781 --> 00:20:00.242]  I understand, yeah.
[00:20:00.822 --> 00:20:05.065]  Because I do a lot of advocacy work in Washington.
[00:20:05.085 --> 00:20:05.885]  Oh, I bet you're busy.
[00:20:06.145 --> 00:20:08.426]  So how do folks get involved with what you're doing?
[00:20:09.487 --> 00:20:13.269]  Well, there's a lot of information out on the internet.
[00:20:13.489 --> 00:20:17.852]  Our website is actually TACA now, so T-A-C-A.
[00:20:19.145 --> 00:20:21.906]  Now.org, and you can find a lot of information.
[00:20:21.926 --> 00:20:24.127]  Oh, was that wrong when I said THCA.com?
[00:20:24.147 --> 00:20:24.587]  That's wrong?
[00:20:25.027 --> 00:20:25.528]  That's wrong.
[00:20:25.728 --> 00:20:27.568]  I'm sorry, that was on my sheet here.
[00:20:28.209 --> 00:20:29.169]  That's okay.
[00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:32.250]  You'd go flying to Mexico, because that's the airline.
[00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:34.551]  Man, I just, everything, okay, great.
[00:20:34.571 --> 00:20:34.811]  Thank you.
[00:20:34.831 --> 00:20:35.371]  That's okay.
[00:20:35.391 --> 00:20:36.912]  There's also NVIC.org.
[00:20:42.586 --> 00:20:44.566]  National Vaccine Information Center.
[00:20:44.747 --> 00:20:46.087]  They have a lot of information.
[00:20:47.187 --> 00:20:49.748]  Generation Rescue has a lot of information.
[00:20:50.188 --> 00:20:52.688]  GenerationRescue.org.
[00:20:53.108 --> 00:20:59.930]  You know, and the thing is, as parents, we're really trying to make it a safe world for all parents.
[00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:01.930]  We get yelled at.
[00:21:02.631 --> 00:21:08.612]  I've been called the baby killer because I, you know, I'm, they look at me as anti-vaccine and I said, you know what?
[00:21:08.925 --> 00:21:11.526]  There's some really easy things to do to clean up this program.
[00:21:12.607 --> 00:21:15.068]  Well, these are arrogant people that want to shut you up.
[00:21:15.128 --> 00:21:18.289]  The baby killers are the ones putting out poison vaccines.
[00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:24.112]  They say, you're going to kill our babies because you're not vaccinated.
[00:21:24.372 --> 00:21:27.553]  If their vaccines supposedly are protecting them, what's the problem?
[00:21:29.074 --> 00:21:31.355]  Yeah, I often think that too.
[00:21:33.166 --> 00:21:41.811]  What we need to do is stop producing... Actually, we need to produce in single-dose vials, so we don't need all those toxic preservatives.
[00:21:42.111 --> 00:21:44.252]  Who wants to expose infants to toxins?
[00:21:44.552 --> 00:21:45.313]  Who does?
[00:21:45.373 --> 00:21:45.893]  The globalists.
[00:21:45.913 --> 00:21:46.213]  Stay there.
[00:21:46.233 --> 00:21:47.554]  I want to come back and let you talk a little bit more.
[00:21:47.574 --> 00:21:49.115]  We appreciate you coming on with us and we'll let you go.
[00:21:49.415 --> 00:21:56.760]  The guys were just up in Boston, outside Boston, and they're going to be in studio.
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:58.601]  We're on the march.
[00:21:59.041 --> 00:22:00.542]  The empire's on the run.
[00:22:01.537 --> 00:22:04.318]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:12.340]  HempUSA.org is now offering free shipping worldwide to better serve our customers.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:18.862]  Our goal is to get these fine hemp products to you in the least amount of time so you can enjoy what the powder seeds and oil can do for you.
[00:22:19.082 --> 00:22:21.563]  HempUSA.org has a warning that the U.S.
[00:22:21.603 --> 00:22:25.304]  food supplies are dangerously low and we urge you to protect your family with
[00:22:26.681 --> 00:22:27.241]  We're good to go!
[00:22:55.715 --> 00:22:58.676]  Why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?
[00:22:58.936 --> 00:23:01.277]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[00:23:01.457 --> 00:23:06.478]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[00:23:07.658 --> 00:23:12.880]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:13.682 --> 00:23:19.025]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:25.748]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:23:26.068 --> 00:23:27.869]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:23:28.029 --> 00:23:30.410]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:23:30.491 --> 00:23:41.376]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:23:43.684 --> 00:23:44.925]  It's not about left or right.
[00:23:45.346 --> 00:23:46.747]  It's about a one world government.
[00:23:47.207 --> 00:23:53.553]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:23:54.114 --> 00:24:01.901]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:24:02.381 --> 00:24:03.522]  The Obama Deception.
[00:24:03.943 --> 00:24:05.144]  The people strike back.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.181]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[00:24:09.321 --> 00:24:13.002]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[00:24:13.102 --> 00:24:15.763]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:24:15.923 --> 00:24:23.126]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[00:24:23.266 --> 00:24:23.947]  Have a great day.
[00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:43.712]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[00:24:43.872 --> 00:24:48.874]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:24:49.675 --> 00:24:54.597]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[00:24:54.717 --> 00:24:58.719]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:24:59.179 --> 00:25:01.660]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:02.260]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:25:19.051 --> 00:25:23.614]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving.
[00:25:25.055 --> 00:25:27.657]  I won't even turn my head.
[00:25:28.298 --> 00:25:33.261]  Rebecca E. Smith, give us your website since I was giving out a Mexican Airlines website earlier.
[00:25:33.581 --> 00:25:41.207]  Give that out for folks so they can check it out and get involved and hopefully learn what's really going on before they hurt their children.
[00:25:43.376 --> 00:25:53.321]  The most of the information you're going to find at TakaNow.org is for parents who need help getting information for their child with autism.
[00:25:53.681 --> 00:26:00.505]  We do have vaccine links on there, including alternative schedules if you are still looking.
[00:26:01.078 --> 00:26:09.241]  To want to vaccinate your child but not hip with 36 vaccines by the time they're 5 and 33 of those vaccines by the time they're 15 months.
[00:26:09.721 --> 00:26:11.522]  We have alternatives that you can do.
[00:26:11.542 --> 00:26:14.303]  Um, and just practical advice.
[00:26:14.643 --> 00:26:17.664]  Um, which, you know, a lot of this just seems common sense.
[00:26:17.764 --> 00:26:24.207]  Like, if your child's sick the day that you go in to see your pediatrician, maybe you shouldn't vaccinate.
[00:26:24.347 --> 00:26:29.629]  You know, their immune system is already working overtime and that's probably not a good day to
[00:26:30.453 --> 00:26:33.055]  Vaccinate them and expose them to several different viruses.
[00:26:33.395 --> 00:26:37.117]  Have you ever seen photos or videos of inside a vaccine plant?
[00:26:38.438 --> 00:26:39.499]  I have not, no.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.181]  It's pretty scary what goes on in there.
[00:26:43.221 --> 00:26:49.365]  You know, I do worry about all the allergies now.
[00:26:49.445 --> 00:26:59.632]  You know, we're not just talking autism, but how, you know, my kids can't take peanut butter sandwiches to school now because of, you know, there's so many kids with allergies that are fatal.
[00:27:00.393 --> 00:27:11.641]  Um, you know, I worry about that and you read about the solutions of the vaccines are produced in and you find out that, you know, that you were using eggs and there's so many egg allergies now.
[00:27:11.681 --> 00:27:12.922]  No, they use dead babies.
[00:27:14.448 --> 00:27:16.749]  They use aborted fetal tissue.
[00:27:17.449 --> 00:27:19.669]  I've heard that in some of them.
[00:27:19.689 --> 00:27:24.911]  They've used peanut oil and then, you know, then you start to wonder about the peanuts.
[00:27:25.031 --> 00:27:35.653]  And these are allergens that you're told when your babies are young not to expose them to until after they're a year old, but then they're in the infant shots.
[00:27:36.193 --> 00:27:43.335]  There is just a lot of double talk or one hand not knowing what the other is doing.
[00:27:44.533 --> 00:27:48.055]  So, we like to educate parents.
[00:27:49.116 --> 00:27:53.978]  We hope that the CDC will be listening and there'll be vaccine reform.
[00:27:54.719 --> 00:27:59.542]  If there's not, we are going to have to educate everybody on informed consent.
[00:27:59.802 --> 00:28:03.043]  I was about to say, it's going the other direction now.
[00:28:03.084 --> 00:28:08.206]  They're coming out with hundreds of new vaccines a year and they're all lobbying to make them mandatory.
[00:28:08.266 --> 00:28:12.429]  So, I guess soon you'll get a shot every day of the year and then it'll be two shots a day.
[00:28:13.373 --> 00:28:30.211]  Well, it's interesting because just recently I got this really interesting report about the number of shots in first world countries put against the mortality rate and looking at the autism rate.
[00:28:30.952 --> 00:28:34.255]  And the United States, we are number 34?
[00:28:36.147 --> 00:28:36.848]  I don't know.
[00:29:01.969 --> 00:29:07.970]  Read the book, folks, and you can Google Alex Jones, Dr. Eisenstein, the video and audio is all over the web from my interview with him.
[00:29:08.411 --> 00:29:12.752]  But I'd already seen those in news articles, but he was actually compiled some of the data off the other studies.
[00:29:13.892 --> 00:29:19.573]  There is not one autism case out of hundreds of thousands of Amish over decades.
[00:29:20.853 --> 00:29:21.093]  Yeah.
[00:29:21.113 --> 00:29:22.994]  Because they don't vaccinate, but go ahead.
[00:29:24.554 --> 00:29:27.735]  We're always banging our head against the wall wondering
[00:29:28.564 --> 00:29:32.325]  Why there hasn't been the vaccinated versus unvaccinated study.
[00:29:32.726 --> 00:29:39.648]  That's how drug trials, you know, you give a person a drug and compare it to the other person that doesn't have the drug and figure out the health outcome.
[00:29:40.708 --> 00:29:45.150]  We're always been told that there aren't enough people to sustain this study.
[00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.111]  And we have the Amish.
[00:29:47.191 --> 00:29:51.212]  We also have Dr. Eisenstein, right?
[00:29:51.492 --> 00:29:51.792]  Yes.
[00:29:52.332 --> 00:29:53.413]  Yeah, he has.
[00:29:54.522 --> 00:30:00.363]  He has a practice of, I guess, tens of thousands of children in Illinois that have not been vaccinated.
[00:30:00.824 --> 00:30:08.546]  They have very low rates of allergies and asthma, and I think maybe only a couple of instances of autism.
[00:30:09.206 --> 00:30:18.088]  And, you know, I think you can get to autism other ways besides vaccines, but the current increase
[00:30:18.963 --> 00:30:24.626]  My gut feeling is that the vaccines have something to do with the massive numbers we see right now.
[00:30:25.106 --> 00:30:29.649]  Although I do concede that that's not the only way you can get there.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:39.222]  Yeah, well they've done GMO studies with different rodent species, with the GMO, genetically modified crops, and it's causing similar things.
[00:30:39.262 --> 00:30:40.682]  So, it's real simple.
[00:30:42.723 --> 00:30:50.125]  There's a lot of different autoimmune developments that are man-made that are triggering this, and then it's a cascading effect.
[00:30:51.605 --> 00:31:07.553]  In closing, I just want to commend you for the work you're doing, and add that I think the most important thing you're doing is, they do have treatments, they have medical doctors that are doing detoxes, other things, especially if it's done early enough, where they're actually reversing a lot of autism, instead of them just saying, put your kid in a warehouse.
[00:31:08.493 --> 00:31:10.334]  Tell us about that.
[00:31:11.055 --> 00:31:17.358]  Well, Taka has, the last time I checked, 68 children that have lost their autism diagnosis.
[00:31:17.638 --> 00:31:18.518]  They've recovered.
[00:31:19.992 --> 00:31:23.314]  We also get a lot of criticisms for saying that.
[00:31:24.095 --> 00:31:26.857]  But notice, we didn't say that these children were cured.
[00:31:27.017 --> 00:31:30.679]  We hope someday that there will be a cure, but what we're talking about is a recovery.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.581]  And what we say, it's kind of like being hit by a bus.
[00:31:34.122 --> 00:31:37.964]  You can recover, but you still might have some scars and some limbs.
[00:31:38.325 --> 00:31:43.088]  But we're talking about children that are fully mainstreamed into school now with no support.
[00:31:43.828 --> 00:31:47.211]  And that is because they were able to
[00:31:48.143 --> 00:31:48.824]  I don't know.
[00:32:07.403 --> 00:32:10.064]  You know, always having to wear diapers, not wearing diapers.
[00:32:10.124 --> 00:32:14.305]  And when you look over a lifespan, that is a great improvement.
[00:32:14.665 --> 00:32:14.865]  It is.
[00:32:14.925 --> 00:32:15.706]  It is.
[00:32:15.886 --> 00:32:19.047]  Listen, listen, I want to thank you for joining us and spending time.
[00:32:19.107 --> 00:32:21.427]  And folks can find out more at your website.
[00:32:21.447 --> 00:32:22.688]  Give that out for folks one more time.
[00:32:23.548 --> 00:32:28.190]  It's TACANOW, T-A-C-A-N-O-W dot org.
[00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:28.970]  All right.
[00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:30.550]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[00:32:31.191 --> 00:32:31.771]  No problem.
[00:32:31.791 --> 00:32:32.191]  Take care.
[00:32:32.725 --> 00:32:33.025]  Take care.
[00:32:33.265 --> 00:32:41.128]  You know, that's a nice lady, folks, but we've had hundreds and hundreds of experts, medical doctors on over this, and you heard her.
[00:32:41.148 --> 00:32:48.671]  Well, I think, you know, cutting back on vaccines or an alternate, you know, route, you know, so you're not having your kid hit by a bus, take less of them.
[00:32:49.211 --> 00:32:57.414]  Maybe you're just being hit by a VW van, you know, or, or maybe the next time you're being hit by a bus is being like hit in the head with a baseball bat.
[00:32:58.715 --> 00:33:02.558]  Or, maybe it's not like being hit by a bus, it's like throwing your kid down the stairs at first, you know?
[00:33:02.898 --> 00:33:16.368]  We're not gonna... And again, it's these nice mothers, nice people, they're like, I don't understand why the government can't figure it out, why they're so dumb, I... I... I... I can't understand, though they know, they know, okay folks?
[00:33:17.088 --> 00:33:18.950]  They enjoy what they're doing.
[00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:20.111]  Texas Academy of Sciences.
[00:33:20.771 --> 00:33:21.791]  I'll give you hundreds of examples.
[00:33:21.811 --> 00:33:22.412]  Here's the best one.
[00:33:22.732 --> 00:33:26.873]  In the newspapers, Dr. Eric Pianca gives speeches at Austin, St.
[00:33:27.833 --> 00:33:34.255]  Edward's, Texas Academy of Sciences in South Texas, another one, and he says, we've got to kill 90% of the population, we've got to start now.
[00:33:34.595 --> 00:33:40.017]  And he projects giant red skulls on the wall in a PowerPoint and standing ovation with people crying.
[00:33:40.857 --> 00:33:41.677]  This is religious.
[00:33:41.757 --> 00:33:49.380]  See, this is a, at their heart, an insane, wild power trip of just going, I'm a scientist, I'm important.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.541]  Oh, I know how to make the tough decisions and we're gonna kill everybody.
[00:33:52.601 --> 00:33:53.642]  Oh God, it's for the Earth.
[00:33:54.042 --> 00:33:55.803]  I just hate people.
[00:33:56.844 --> 00:34:00.326]  And you know who those people are and you find them in the biology departments at your major universities.
[00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:05.012]  Kettler got his ideas from us, the health departments.
[00:34:05.112 --> 00:34:06.113]  Folks, this isn't my opinion.
[00:34:06.333 --> 00:34:09.676]  Go read books, go read the encyclopedia about the founding of health departments.
[00:34:10.176 --> 00:34:13.278]  It was founded in England 120 years ago, here in the U.S.
[00:34:13.298 --> 00:34:16.361]  90-something years ago, in Germany 90-something years ago.
[00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:23.306]  It was totally bankrolled by the Rockefellers and all the classic names, the Queen of England,
[00:34:24.755 --> 00:34:32.941]  I mean, if you go to Wikipedia, which has a lot of disinfo, but the point is they link to government documents, the Rockefeller Foundation pages is, in fact, pull that up, is actually accurate.
[00:34:32.961 --> 00:34:35.263]  Think about Wikipedia, some stuff's accurate, some stuff's inaccurate.
[00:34:35.483 --> 00:34:38.705]  You'd have to, like, my name's spelled wrong on there and they won't let us fix it.
[00:34:39.166 --> 00:34:41.567]  And they've got all this wrong info about me, but that's on purpose.
[00:34:42.208 --> 00:34:50.234]  With the Rockefeller Foundation, that's accurate because you can follow the links to university reports where they admit it, where they founded the eugenics movement.
[00:34:50.554 --> 00:34:52.956]  And they founded cancer treatment movement, they founded it all.
[00:34:54.312 --> 00:34:55.793]  Just Google Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:34:56.173 --> 00:35:01.596]  One of the first links that comes up is Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:35:02.357 --> 00:35:03.197]  On screen please.
[00:35:04.658 --> 00:35:06.979]  Now, you can actually link through on this.
[00:35:07.439 --> 00:35:08.100]  It's cited.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.921]  But I'm just pulling up something quick here to show you.
[00:35:13.002 --> 00:35:15.324]  It says some of the historical achievements include.
[00:35:16.304 --> 00:35:17.265]  This is achievements.
[00:35:19.468 --> 00:35:22.430]  Funding eugenics programs in colleges and universities.
[00:35:26.372 --> 00:35:27.573]  That's an achievement!
[00:35:31.415 --> 00:35:35.417]  Okay, now just Google Rockefeller Foundation eugenics itself.
[00:35:35.658 --> 00:35:36.918]  Well, actually, click on their sourcing.
[00:35:37.579 --> 00:35:38.719]  It says number one right there.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.821]  It's the last one there in that column, guys.
[00:35:43.522 --> 00:35:44.243]  No, no, let me show you.
[00:35:45.263 --> 00:35:46.184]  Let me have control of the mouse.
[00:35:46.224 --> 00:35:46.504]  I'll do it.
[00:35:53.242 --> 00:35:54.603]  I'll find it during a break.
[00:35:54.623 --> 00:35:57.446]  Yeah, here it is.
[00:35:58.026 --> 00:35:59.707]  Nature.com, that's their link.
[00:36:00.068 --> 00:36:02.049]  Nazi eugenics created in the United States.
[00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:06.052]  And then you can go through all that, how the Rockefellers financed it all.
[00:36:07.893 --> 00:36:09.735]  So, it was Nazi eugenics created in the U.S.
[00:36:09.795 --> 00:36:11.116]  and you read it and it's all there.
[00:36:11.136 --> 00:36:12.217]  That's the Journal of Nature.
[00:36:13.959 --> 00:36:25.526]  Okay, that said, I'm going to get back into that after I take some calls, because I want to get through Heidi and Dorothy and Forrest and a few others, Barbara, that have been holding patiently, and we're going to get to you guys in just a moment, Tony, Barbara, and others.
[00:36:29.164 --> 00:36:37.470]  I want to just stop here and say though, I get angry, I get upset, I sit here and try to project this as evil as it really is to break the spell.
[00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:56.103]  For all my foibles and all my problems and all the things I do that are obnoxious, the one saving grace I have is that I am aware of just how shocking and evil this is and I've broken my conditioning.
[00:36:56.343 --> 00:36:58.124]  There is no spell on Alex Jones.
[00:36:59.204 --> 00:37:04.389]  I go to bed every night knowing there's a criminal global elite that is soft-killing most of the world's population.
[00:37:04.869 --> 00:37:05.610]  I have their documents.
[00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:06.351]  I have their statements.
[00:37:06.531 --> 00:37:07.852]  I know my life's in danger.
[00:37:08.253 --> 00:37:09.734]  I know the decisions I'm making.
[00:37:10.054 --> 00:37:11.556]  I know how important my work is.
[00:37:11.856 --> 00:37:13.057]  And I'm not afraid of being killed.
[00:37:13.718 --> 00:37:22.886]  I am afraid of not doing my work, not being effective, being stupid, not being as focused as I should be to warn people.
[00:37:23.027 --> 00:37:24.288]  I want to complete my mission.
[00:37:25.819 --> 00:37:28.081]  And then that's not some radical heroic thing.
[00:37:28.121 --> 00:37:30.462]  That is a basic human directive.
[00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:33.044]  If you care about your own species and your children.
[00:37:34.485 --> 00:37:36.446]  You have lost your basic directives out there.
[00:37:36.486 --> 00:37:39.548]  You have to get the prime directive back in place.
[00:37:40.429 --> 00:37:46.413]  Now I want to go to Rob Dew and of course Aaron Dykes who we sent up to
[00:37:49.488 --> 00:38:01.532]  Massachusetts, they were up there in Lexington, where 234 years ago, in 1775, the Revolutionary War started when the Redcoats came to confiscate the guns.
[00:38:01.592 --> 00:38:05.993]  Now, the media would tell you the Redcoats didn't exist, it wasn't about guns, and that didn't happen.
[00:38:06.013 --> 00:38:10.834]  There was actually a big university professor who said it wasn't about gun confiscation, and that the colonies were anti-gun.
[00:38:11.054 --> 00:38:13.375]  We exposed him, he lost his tenure.
[00:38:13.595 --> 00:38:14.395]  So I'm not even joking.
[00:38:14.415 --> 00:38:16.816]  See, we're entering a new world now where there's no EU,
[00:38:17.216 --> 00:38:20.957]  But there is a EU, and where there's no Lexington and Concord, but there is.
[00:38:21.758 --> 00:38:29.141]  And where, you know, where Obama's cutting the budget by half when he spent more than all presidents before him combined.
[00:38:29.621 --> 00:38:31.481]  We're entering a new vortex of disinfo.
[00:38:31.681 --> 00:38:33.702]  But you guys were there, I want to commend you for going.
[00:38:33.962 --> 00:38:34.943]  You said it was a great event.
[00:38:34.983 --> 00:38:46.267]  Tell folks about the Oath Keepers and the Committees of Safety on the anniversary, on the green, having all these police and military swearing they'll protect and defend the Constitution and not follow the New World Order.
[00:38:47.165 --> 00:38:56.832]  That was a pretty amazing event that we attended, and I'd like to thank the guys at Oath Keepers and Committees of Safety for making us feel welcome, giving us their time.
[00:38:56.872 --> 00:39:02.095]  We got a lot of good interviews right before the event, during the event, after the event.
[00:39:02.636 --> 00:39:04.617]  And then we watched the reenactment that morning.
[00:39:05.338 --> 00:39:09.120]  We took some cameras out there and got in.
[00:39:09.421 --> 00:39:10.641]  It was all about guns.
[00:39:10.661 --> 00:39:15.365]  They said, give us, put down your weapons and walk away, and a guy jumps out of the crowd and says, you're not getting my gun.
[00:39:16.225 --> 00:39:17.565]  And, uh, that's what it was about.
[00:39:17.825 --> 00:39:18.166]  Period.
[00:39:18.566 --> 00:39:19.766]  You know, they wanted their guns.
[00:39:20.666 --> 00:39:22.547]  So, um, they stood up.
[00:39:22.867 --> 00:39:25.747]  Watching that battle, the guys were really, uh, really into it.
[00:39:25.947 --> 00:39:27.908]  And, um... Hey, let me ask John a question real fast.
[00:39:31.909 --> 00:39:34.649]  We just put in a new mic processor, a new mic stuff in here.
[00:39:34.689 --> 00:39:35.750]  I was just checking it with the network.
[00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:36.790]  I'm in Minnesota.
[00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:37.810]  They're in there messing with it.
[00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:39.671]  I'm getting a buzz in my ear, but you guys say you're not.
[00:39:40.231 --> 00:39:41.091]  Okay, um...
[00:39:43.553 --> 00:39:48.517]  Again, for those who don't know what was going on up there, recap the basics of it and then give us a report, please.
[00:39:49.277 --> 00:39:55.682]  So, Oath Keepers is an organization that got together with Committees of Safety to actually bring on this event.
[00:39:55.722 --> 00:40:03.307]  What they wanted to do is have people who had already taken the oath reaffirm their oath, because what they're looking for is not oath takers, they're looking for Oath Keepers.
[00:40:03.947 --> 00:40:12.173]  And Stuart Rhodes and Walter Reddy had a great cast of guys and it was literally a three-hour event from start to finish.
[00:40:13.414 --> 00:40:14.395]  We're good to go.
[00:40:33.749 --> 00:40:34.510]  Who's the other guy?
[00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:36.973]  The retired policeman?
[00:40:36.993 --> 00:40:40.417]  They got up and read the 10 orders that they will not obey.
[00:40:40.437 --> 00:40:41.078]  Dave Freeman.
[00:40:41.278 --> 00:40:43.141]  Sheriff Mack was there.
[00:40:43.361 --> 00:40:44.262]  He had a really good speech.
[00:40:44.282 --> 00:40:46.064]  He actually stopped in the middle.
[00:40:46.084 --> 00:40:48.327]  He said, I want everybody to get together because everybody's kind of spread out.
[00:40:48.347 --> 00:40:50.270]  He's like, we need to see all the numbers.
[00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:51.171]  Everybody come around.
[00:40:51.651 --> 00:40:56.132]  One thing that was interesting, there was not one mainstream media person present, but a lot of citizen media.
[00:40:56.192 --> 00:40:57.493]  A lot of different groups were out there.
[00:40:57.513 --> 00:41:05.295]  Oh, they're scared to death of police and military saying, hold the Bill of Rights, Constitution, and their oath, because according to the federal reports, that's all terrorism.
[00:41:05.855 --> 00:41:08.896]  Owning guns, buying ammo, being a veteran, you're the number one threat.
[00:41:08.916 --> 00:41:10.397]  So they keep telling you it's about Al-Qaeda.
[00:41:10.717 --> 00:41:15.098]  It's really all been designed for you, people that won't let foreign banks conquer us.
[00:41:15.158 --> 00:41:16.318]  We've been conquered.
[00:41:16.718 --> 00:41:17.979]  It's through fraud, but it...
[00:41:18.579 --> 00:41:23.264]  They need our acquiescence to their fraud to continue it and expand it.
[00:41:23.705 --> 00:41:23.845]  Right.
[00:41:24.125 --> 00:41:37.239]  And I don't even know if you've heard about this, but yesterday, it was the day before yesterday, I think, they found an ex-marine who had, he was trying to bring a gun and some ammo and a grenade fuse onto a plane.
[00:41:37.259 --> 00:41:39.922]  And he actually got on the plane and they checked him in Boston.
[00:41:40.658 --> 00:41:50.662]  They checked his bags again and found all this stuff, which is interesting that it didn't get caught through the scanner because they stopped Aaron coming back and wanted to search his bags because of his Al-Qaeda-like camera, right?
[00:41:51.562 --> 00:41:52.462]  Yeah, that'd be right.
[00:41:53.163 --> 00:41:54.883]  It's always, always a camera.
[00:41:54.903 --> 00:41:55.764]  Always the camera.
[00:41:56.024 --> 00:41:57.364]  And what are you filming for?
[00:41:57.544 --> 00:41:59.645]  People who can't even speak English anymore.
[00:41:59.665 --> 00:42:00.745]  They asked you at the airport.
[00:42:00.925 --> 00:42:01.326]  Yeah.
[00:42:01.446 --> 00:42:02.066]  Why you film?
[00:42:02.486 --> 00:42:03.546]  You know, you line up!
[00:42:05.884 --> 00:42:06.064]  Oh!
[00:42:06.425 --> 00:42:13.348]  I mean, no, I mean, that's what it's come... No, I mean, I saw one time a World War II vet, probably dead now, it was like five, six years ago, in San Francisco.
[00:42:14.028 --> 00:42:18.611]  He's getting on a plane to go to Hawaii to the World War II memorial.
[00:42:18.651 --> 00:42:19.351]  He'd been in the battle.
[00:42:19.651 --> 00:42:20.412]  And he literally...
[00:42:21.485 --> 00:42:29.172]  They have this security firm that's wearing bright blue commando outfits in these black and grays and he had an oxygen bottle and they were jabbing him going, HAKALUNYA!
[00:42:29.332 --> 00:42:31.034]  HAKALUNYA!
[00:42:31.114 --> 00:42:32.135]  Because that's who they're going to use.
[00:42:32.175 --> 00:42:36.679]  I've got the FEMA drill with foreign troops for us right here that's coming up.
[00:42:37.059 --> 00:42:38.700]  National level exercise 2009.
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:41.343]  And I guess that's the new patriotism.
[00:42:41.623 --> 00:42:43.465]  So you have foreigners going, HAKALUNYA!
[00:42:43.685 --> 00:42:44.165]  HAKALUNYA!
[00:42:44.325 --> 00:42:45.286]  Alex, they're pulling me over.
[00:42:46.167 --> 00:42:50.889]  They pull me over for a camera and the woman next to me is being extra searched for a knitting kit.
[00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:52.289]  A crocheting kit.
[00:42:52.409 --> 00:42:54.210]  It's about training us.
[00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:55.050]  We're the enemy.
[00:42:55.390 --> 00:43:05.854]  It's the good law-abiding slaves must be taught and they're importing people from third world police states who are used to this and who enjoy, frankly, boshing the American people around.
[00:43:06.454 --> 00:43:07.454]  But that's why it's so long.
[00:43:28.221 --> 00:43:37.269]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:38.911]  Garden in a can.
[00:43:39.331 --> 00:43:40.172]  It's that simple.
[00:43:40.532 --> 00:43:40.832]  Fresh.
[00:43:41.233 --> 00:43:41.613]  Healthy.
[00:43:42.093 --> 00:43:42.394]  Easy.
[00:43:42.914 --> 00:43:46.878]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[00:43:47.258 --> 00:43:48.159]  Ready when you are.
[00:43:48.815 --> 00:43:52.460]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden In A Can.

[00:44:06.716 --> 00:44:12.043]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:44:12.543 --> 00:44:19.592]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:44:20.117 --> 00:44:26.322]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:26.702 --> 00:44:28.544]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:28.684 --> 00:44:31.106]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:44:31.186 --> 00:44:42.135]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:44:42.755 --> 00:44:44.036]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:44.437 --> 00:44:45.798]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:44:46.272 --> 00:44:52.634]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:44:53.174 --> 00:45:00.956]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:45:01.436 --> 00:45:02.596]  The Obama Deception.
[00:45:03.017 --> 00:45:04.197]  The people strike back.
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:08.322]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:45:08.462 --> 00:45:15.148]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:45:15.408 --> 00:45:23.596]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:45:23.816 --> 00:45:29.541]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:45:29.701 --> 00:45:31.502]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:45:31.542 --> 00:45:33.702]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:45:33.722 --> 00:45:38.104]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:45:38.264 --> 00:45:40.404]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:45:40.484 --> 00:45:48.347]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:45:48.387 --> 00:45:48.647]  We're good.
[00:46:20.311 --> 00:46:35.684]  On a lonely, lonesome highway, on the east of Omaha, I listen to the engine moanin' out this one old song, and think about the woman
[00:46:36.235 --> 00:46:38.996]  Okay, guys.
[00:46:39.136 --> 00:46:42.177]  You had a lot of fun.
[00:46:42.257 --> 00:46:43.457]  Clear Co and Gel Pro was there.
[00:46:43.477 --> 00:46:45.678]  I don't want to get into that, though, too much.
[00:46:45.718 --> 00:46:48.559]  Just classic behavior by these people.
[00:46:48.579 --> 00:46:54.201]  So, finish up the report about evil Americans saying they'll follow the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[00:46:54.881 --> 00:46:57.522]  Yeah, so there was about, what, 350 people there?
[00:46:57.542 --> 00:46:58.322]  It was a good estimate.
[00:46:58.542 --> 00:46:59.843]  I think it may have been as much as 500.
[00:47:00.023 --> 00:47:00.863]  I'm not sure.
[00:47:00.983 --> 00:47:03.184]  Yeah, it was... But then the main Paul Revere event had about 5,000.
[00:47:04.369 --> 00:47:07.551]  The main event the next morning, yeah, had 5,000 people.
[00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:12.914]  And they did put a little speech in there about 9-11, before how we were attacked on that day.
[00:47:13.034 --> 00:47:17.877]  That was the last time we had a call to action, an attack on our country.
[00:47:18.617 --> 00:47:21.759]  That's why we've set up a police raid for all you patriots here today.
[00:47:21.819 --> 00:47:22.740]  It's all for you!
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.941]  But turn in your guns or Al-Qaeda will get you!
[00:47:25.962 --> 00:47:28.603]  I'm fighting Al-Qaeda!
[00:47:29.424 --> 00:47:32.425]  Al-Qaeda is a white guy or black guy on the firearm.
[00:47:32.465 --> 00:47:33.446]  Arrest them all, go ahead.
[00:47:34.079 --> 00:47:36.680]  So also, you know, Oath Keepers had a great ceremony.
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:40.362]  Captain Larry Bailey, who's an ex-Navy SEAL, he administered the oath.
[00:47:40.382 --> 00:47:44.104]  I actually took the oath with a lot of other people who were non-military.
[00:47:44.124 --> 00:47:44.924]  I also took the oath.
[00:47:45.364 --> 00:47:46.224]  They were allowing them to.
[00:47:46.244 --> 00:47:48.706]  So it was a pretty serious, pretty solemn event.
[00:47:48.726 --> 00:47:49.666]  A lot of good speeches.
[00:47:49.686 --> 00:47:50.646]  A lot of good speeches.
[00:47:51.047 --> 00:47:52.887]  So I'm there, Alex.
[00:47:53.008 --> 00:47:53.328]  I'm in.
[00:47:53.748 --> 00:47:54.948]  You're with Al-Qaeda now.
[00:47:54.968 --> 00:47:56.149]  I'm with Al-Qaeda.
[00:47:56.169 --> 00:47:57.590]  And Oath Keepers wanted to give you a shirt.
[00:47:58.090 --> 00:47:59.310]  They sent one for you here.
[00:48:01.554 --> 00:48:02.854]  And so here you go.
[00:48:03.275 --> 00:48:04.635]  It's a nice Oath Keeper shirt.
[00:48:05.175 --> 00:48:05.735]  You can keep it.
[00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:07.416]  You said a lot of supporters of the show.
[00:48:07.476 --> 00:48:09.017]  There was a rumor that I was going to be there.
[00:48:09.337 --> 00:48:10.317]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:10.517 --> 00:48:15.219]  Not only did they ask and demand that Alex Jones show up, but started rumors.
[00:48:15.299 --> 00:48:16.579]  I think Alex Jones is here.
[00:48:16.639 --> 00:48:17.779]  I saw him over there.
[00:48:17.799 --> 00:48:18.540]  Really?
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.020]  Has he come?
[00:48:20.658 --> 00:48:21.679]  Folks, he's not coming.
[00:48:22.299 --> 00:48:26.120]  Send his support, he's got to do the show for many more listeners, right?
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.121]  We had a great interview with the guy who wrote the 29 Palm Survey.
[00:48:29.381 --> 00:48:30.022]  Well done.
[00:48:30.482 --> 00:48:33.323]  And here's a copy of it for you, autographed for you.
[00:48:33.803 --> 00:48:34.423]  He was a nice guy.
[00:48:34.443 --> 00:48:35.044]  Excellent.
[00:48:35.224 --> 00:48:39.925]  And that's the Marine, because you know they were doing these questionnaires and he thought he would do one and then she could make it public.
[00:48:40.386 --> 00:48:41.366]  That was the way he got it out.
[00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:44.247]  And so this is all over for the new Obama film.
[00:48:44.287 --> 00:48:46.648]  Also, I want to make an announcement about the new Obama film right now.
[00:48:47.839 --> 00:48:52.911]  I could release it July 4th and make it still good and powerful, but I've got other interviews I want to do.
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:49:00.144]  I was going to make it, you know, probably not as powerful as Obama Deception, but just all the latest info.
[00:49:00.685 --> 00:49:02.546]  And I thought, no, I'm going to make it more powerful.
[00:49:03.006 --> 00:49:05.068]  So now it's going to come out September 1st.
[00:49:05.148 --> 00:49:05.568]  That's it.
[00:49:05.628 --> 00:49:07.870]  That's the launch date, that Tuesday or Wednesday or whatever it is.
[00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:08.790]  I think it's a Tuesday.
[00:49:09.171 --> 00:49:10.552]  It is coming out September 1st.
[00:49:10.592 --> 00:49:14.014]  I mean, it'll be done by the end of July.
[00:49:14.394 --> 00:49:16.636]  We're shifting into a chemtrail film we're making after that.
[00:49:17.036 --> 00:49:19.878]  But we've got a race, but that's only a month and a half more, really.
[00:49:20.319 --> 00:49:23.301]  So we've got more time now to do a few more interviews.
[00:49:24.338 --> 00:49:24.799]  Excellent.
[00:49:24.999 --> 00:49:27.421]  Alright, anything else that happened while you were there?
[00:49:27.601 --> 00:49:33.807]  It just really is refreshing to see active duty military police standing up for the Constitution.
[00:49:33.827 --> 00:49:34.848]  Number one threat in here.
[00:49:35.169 --> 00:49:36.970]  No, I will not confiscate guns.
[00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:39.773]  No, I will not conduct illegal searches under the Fourth Amendment.
[00:49:39.793 --> 00:49:41.074]  I will not put people in FEMA camps.
[00:49:41.535 --> 00:49:43.437]  You know, knowing this stuff is going on routinely.
[00:49:43.457 --> 00:49:45.539]  But the camps are for our safety, Glenn Beck says.
[00:49:46.636 --> 00:49:50.239]  We also met the mass marine who's a young guy who is still a marine right now.
[00:49:50.679 --> 00:49:53.321]  He took the oath and he's going to end up being a liaison.
[00:49:53.381 --> 00:49:54.321]  Did you say the mass?
[00:49:54.582 --> 00:49:55.262]  The mass marine.
[00:49:55.282 --> 00:49:57.023]  He did a couple of YouTube videos.
[00:49:57.083 --> 00:49:57.544]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:57.944 --> 00:50:01.346]  Him and his guys, they basically study the Constitution, all his marine buddies.
[00:50:01.486 --> 00:50:05.509]  And so they're really... So I think they were... The Al-Qaeda-tution.
[00:50:05.749 --> 00:50:06.970]  Anything of Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:07.651]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:09.712]  No, really, they built this grid for fighting Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:09.952 --> 00:50:12.334]  Now they're going, by the way, the whole thing's for you, the American people.
[00:50:12.674 --> 00:50:13.755]  You are Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:14.315 --> 00:50:15.596]  Right, and these guys know that.
[00:50:15.656 --> 00:50:20.902]  They know that they are going to be targeted, so they uphold themselves with a lot of dignity and a lot of respect.
[00:50:20.962 --> 00:50:28.008]  Good, they have pledged their lives, their treasure, their sacred honor, their blood on the Tree of Liberty and we will be victorious.
[00:50:28.028 --> 00:50:30.110]  And we were on that field where the blood was spilled.
[00:50:30.851 --> 00:50:32.333]  Come back, I want to hear about that.
[00:50:33.073 --> 00:50:34.915]  Look at you, you've got a little gleam in your eyes.
[00:50:36.216 --> 00:50:38.278]  You are fulfilling your destiny.
[00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:41.433]  Alright, we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:41.694 --> 00:50:43.196]  72nd break, the final hour.
[00:50:43.416 --> 00:50:46.240]  And we got that pastor coming on that got beat up and your phone calls.
[00:50:48.523 --> 00:50:52.188]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:50:57.130 --> 00:50:58.710]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:03.432]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:51:03.552 --> 00:51:06.312]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:51:06.513 --> 00:51:09.373]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:09.553 --> 00:51:15.395]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:51:15.635 --> 00:51:18.598]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:18.878 --> 00:51:25.784]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:51:25.884 --> 00:51:28.987]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:51:59.841 --> 00:52:01.743]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:52:02.224 --> 00:52:05.006]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:21.565 --> 00:52:23.066]  Hey folks, look at the camera over here.
[00:52:23.186 --> 00:52:24.507]  Have you seen this guy?
[00:52:25.147 --> 00:52:26.668]  Viral video all over the web.
[00:52:26.688 --> 00:52:32.011]  The version my guys found has, uh, 900 views.
[00:52:33.092 --> 00:52:35.053]  The original video he did has like 300,000.
[00:52:35.474 --> 00:52:38.035]  Yeah, here's one.

[00:52:39.556 --> 00:52:42.738]  Baptist pastor, beaten, tased, big brother.
[00:52:42.758 --> 00:52:43.819]  Click on that one right there.
[00:52:44.519 --> 00:52:45.440]  I think that's the original.
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:47.181]  There's a bunch of them with hundreds of thousands of views.
[00:52:47.961 --> 00:52:50.463]  But this is happening to everybody in these internal checkpoints.
[00:52:50.944 --> 00:52:51.864]  And you're an illegal alien?
[00:52:51.884 --> 00:52:54.807]  You go right through and they even will take you and give you a job.
[00:52:54.847 --> 00:52:55.788]  That's CNN.
[00:52:56.048 --> 00:52:56.849]  But you're a citizen?
[00:52:56.889 --> 00:52:58.350]  I mean, they just start beating you.
[00:52:59.051 --> 00:53:00.832]  And that's how they roll.
[00:53:00.892 --> 00:53:01.493]  You're a gun owner?
[00:53:01.513 --> 00:53:02.173]  You love freedom?
[00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:03.990]  You're a preacher?
[00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:07.071]  Oh my goodness, we've got an Al-Qaeda here, boss!
[00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:12.753]  Now, what was it like being on Lexington Green, where Al-Qaeda fought the good troops?
[00:53:13.293 --> 00:53:16.834]  The evil American Al-Qaeda fought the loving British troops?
[00:53:17.534 --> 00:53:18.634]  It's a pretty amazing place.
[00:53:18.995 --> 00:53:20.375]  They've kept it up really nice.
[00:53:20.995 --> 00:53:23.436]  Where the incredibly honorable Redcoats fought the terrorists?
[00:53:24.136 --> 00:53:38.533]  Right, and that, there's a particularly interesting, the leader of those redcoats was, he had a big pot belly, and he had his big bottom lip sticking out, and I said, oh, Alex is going to love this guy, because you do that voice, that just sounds totally, you know, British Royalty.
[00:53:38.553 --> 00:53:39.834]  Put down your weapon!
[00:53:44.526 --> 00:53:45.167]  You're gonna love it.
[00:53:45.307 --> 00:53:47.788]  So, you know, we got a lot of that stuff.
[00:53:48.028 --> 00:53:50.870]  And, you know, there was fog on the battlefield that morning.
[00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:59.416]  The guys were coming out and they do the whole reenactment where they actually show a couple guys running back to get John Hancock's papers.
[00:53:59.596 --> 00:54:02.198]  John Hancock, that degenerate!
[00:54:02.418 --> 00:54:08.042]  He dares sign his name boldly in this act of treason against the crown!
[00:54:09.436 --> 00:54:10.897]  That was pretty much it.
[00:54:10.937 --> 00:54:15.860]  That was, you know, put down your weapons.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:16.881]  And they didn't do it.
[00:54:16.921 --> 00:54:17.822]  They stood their ground.
[00:54:18.162 --> 00:54:19.182]  They were fired upon.
[00:54:19.202 --> 00:54:22.304]  And pretty much they were fired upon by a larger force.
[00:54:22.324 --> 00:54:25.226]  And then they pretty much did an unorganized retreat.
[00:54:25.306 --> 00:54:26.727]  Outrageous terrorists!
[00:54:26.747 --> 00:54:27.968]  But then more militias showed up.
[00:54:28.268 --> 00:54:28.508]  Right.
[00:54:28.568 --> 00:54:30.410]  Well, in Concord, that's where they stuck it to them.
[00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:31.591]  Endurance.
[00:54:31.731 --> 00:54:33.092]  That's where they terrorized.
[00:54:33.132 --> 00:54:34.013]  They were terrorists.
[00:54:34.093 --> 00:54:34.794]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:34.934 --> 00:54:38.998]  Number one threat, founding father of evil.
[00:54:39.218 --> 00:54:44.783]  There was an 80-year-old guy who had fought in the French Revolutionary War, or the French and Indian War.
[00:54:45.343 --> 00:54:50.505]  And he was talking about how he heard him come and he heard the war drums and he got his pistols and went out there, killed three of them.
[00:54:50.525 --> 00:54:51.245]  Then they bayoneted him.
[00:54:51.265 --> 00:54:52.205]  Shot him and bayoneted him.
[00:54:52.225 --> 00:54:53.426]  He lived for another 18 years.
[00:54:53.626 --> 00:54:54.506]  And had a bunch more kids.
[00:54:54.546 --> 00:54:55.186]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:55.246 --> 00:54:57.067]  And this guy was, you know, 80 when he went out and did this.
[00:54:57.107 --> 00:54:58.207]  That was another Al-Qaeda.
[00:54:58.847 --> 00:54:59.988]  Well, that's what I tell old folks.
[00:55:00.028 --> 00:55:00.508]  You're done.
[00:55:00.548 --> 00:55:01.428]  Don't be involved.
[00:55:01.448 --> 00:55:03.049]  Young people, oh, it's time for you to party.
[00:55:03.069 --> 00:55:03.989]  It's your time to party.
[00:55:04.369 --> 00:55:05.170]  It's a little mind trick.
[00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:06.130]  That's how the spells work.
[00:55:06.350 --> 00:55:07.091]  It's your time to party.
[00:55:07.131 --> 00:55:07.431]  Never mind.
[00:55:07.451 --> 00:55:08.051]  Don't be involved.
[00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:09.532]  Oh, you're middle class.
[00:55:09.552 --> 00:55:09.772]  You're 30.
[00:55:10.312 --> 00:55:11.753]  You've got to make money and be successful.
[00:55:12.013 --> 00:55:12.273]  Oh, you're 40.
[00:55:12.553 --> 00:55:13.294]  You have a little fun.
[00:55:13.314 --> 00:55:13.294]  50.
[00:55:13.334 --> 00:55:13.654]  Oh, 60.
[00:55:14.614 --> 00:55:15.715]  You're not supposed to be involved.
[00:55:15.955 --> 00:55:16.616]  Everything's fine.
[00:55:16.936 --> 00:55:19.077]  Well, that's not what's going to happen with Oath Keepers.
[00:55:19.097 --> 00:55:21.698]  They're getting all ages of people and they're taking their oath.
[00:55:21.838 --> 00:55:22.939]  Outrageous!
[00:55:23.099 --> 00:55:23.999]  Outrageous!
[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:24.620]  Rabble!
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:34.949]  But something else about these modern day constitutional oath keepers, half of them talk with, you know, multi-syllable words, almost like the founding fathers.
[00:55:35.289 --> 00:55:38.031]  You get pulled over at TSA, they can't even speak English.
[00:55:38.352 --> 00:55:41.735]  You get pulled over by a private security guard, like, shut up no more.
[00:55:41.775 --> 00:55:46.018]  Yeah, tell folks, they have like our, what, $2,000 lens just ripping it off and laughing at you.
[00:55:46.259 --> 00:55:48.120]  I don't know how expensive it is.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.762]  And like, what is your film about?
[00:55:50.422 --> 00:55:52.623]  Yeah, I mean, tell us what you told me during the break.
[00:55:52.643 --> 00:55:53.743]  They asked all kinds of questions.
[00:55:53.763 --> 00:55:56.864]  They pulled me through, like, you know, what's going on with this camera?
[00:55:56.884 --> 00:55:58.564]  He's like pulling off... What the hell?
[00:55:58.584 --> 00:56:01.065]  We got a camera?
[00:56:01.725 --> 00:56:14.328]  Notice the more cameras they put on us, including school bathrooms, when they see ours, it's like... I mean, they've now made it a law, it's terrorism to photograph police, and now when cops have wrecks or beat people, people take photos, they're being arrested.
[00:56:14.808 --> 00:56:15.869]  They're arresting the Pratt.
[00:56:15.889 --> 00:56:16.529]  They're doing it.
[00:56:17.145 --> 00:56:18.126]  Well, just keep going.
[00:56:18.146 --> 00:56:19.267]  So, tell folks what he did to you.
[00:56:19.347 --> 00:56:20.408]  It's disgusting, Alex.
[00:56:20.468 --> 00:56:21.349]  I mean, it just rips my guts out.
[00:56:21.369 --> 00:56:22.770]  Well, tell folks what it was like in Boston.
[00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:29.376]  He pulls me through, next to the lady with knitting equipment, because she's the other suspicious person out of literally thousands of people.
[00:56:29.396 --> 00:56:31.658]  They have the Rossi Marathon going on.
[00:56:31.718 --> 00:56:32.919]  It took forever to get through.
[00:56:32.939 --> 00:56:34.921]  He's like, what are you filming for?
[00:56:34.981 --> 00:56:35.881]  What is this?
[00:56:36.362 --> 00:56:39.104]  You answer the question now, scum!
[00:56:39.625 --> 00:56:40.686]  And then what happened next?
[00:56:41.286 --> 00:56:43.288]  Yeah, well, plus I was interrupted by the other way.
[00:56:43.308 --> 00:56:44.610]  You move now, I put back.
[00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:45.851]  You answer my questions!
[00:56:46.091 --> 00:56:47.112]  You come here now!
[00:56:47.492 --> 00:56:48.333]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:56:48.433 --> 00:56:56.201]  Doors are... And they didn't know what I was filming, what I was filming for, what I planned to do with it, and I told them I'm filming a free speech.
[00:56:56.241 --> 00:56:56.642]  Hold on!
[00:56:56.742 --> 00:56:58.123]  You shut up!
[00:56:58.183 --> 00:56:59.405]  Get over here!
[00:56:59.625 --> 00:57:01.247]  Get after me!
[00:57:01.507 --> 00:57:02.488]  You slave!
[00:57:02.628 --> 00:57:03.869]  You're my slave now!
[00:57:03.909 --> 00:57:04.430]  Slave!
[00:57:05.666 --> 00:57:07.146]  It is slavery, Alex, and you know it.
[00:57:07.346 --> 00:57:10.287]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:57:10.447 --> 00:57:15.669]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:57:15.969 --> 00:57:21.330]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:22.791]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:57:23.171 --> 00:57:32.073]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:57:32.473 --> 00:57:34.095]  Now, compare a Cal Bend Pure Soap.

[00:58:07.563 --> 00:58:12.887]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:13.388 --> 00:58:20.434]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:58:20.948 --> 00:58:27.153]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:27.533 --> 00:58:29.375]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:29.515 --> 00:58:31.937]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:32.017 --> 00:58:42.986]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:58:43.599 --> 00:58:44.879]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:45.259 --> 00:58:46.640]  It's about a one world government.
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:53.461]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:59:02.283 --> 00:59:03.444]  The Obama Deception.
[00:59:03.864 --> 00:59:05.064]  The people strike back.
[00:59:07.179 --> 00:59:10.460]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:14.702]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:59:14.882 --> 00:59:26.307]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:59:26.547 --> 00:59:32.369]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:59:32.609 --> 00:59:33.250]  We're good to go.
[00:59:55.849 --> 01:00:01.097]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A Silver dot com or call 888-213-4338, 888-213-4338 and help us win this battle.
[01:00:12.617 --> 01:00:27.786]  So basically they told me well you know you're coming out of this car one way or the other and we're going to search this car whether you like it or not and so they a gentleman from the DPS walked over to the passenger side of the vehicle and he got out a hammer
[01:00:28.999 --> 01:00:36.082]  And some other device and he was kind of tapping on the window for a couple minutes like as if you were, you know, getting ready to break the window.
[01:00:36.922 --> 01:00:39.603]  And he was on the passenger side, I'm all the way over on the driver's side.
[01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:45.945]  Well, they told me, you know, cover your eyes because there's going to be glass when we break this window in.
[01:00:46.665 --> 01:00:51.107]  So I put my hands over my face like this and I leaned forward to cover my eyes.
[01:00:52.102 --> 01:00:59.928]  And at that moment, not only did the officer on the passenger side break the window, but another hammer just came from out of nowhere.
[01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:01.409]  I didn't see this coming at all.
[01:01:01.929 --> 01:01:03.871]  And shattered the window right behind my head.
[01:01:03.911 --> 01:01:05.092]  I mean, six inches from my head.
[01:01:05.112 --> 01:01:07.253]  So both windows shattered in the same instant.
[01:01:07.874 --> 01:01:10.596]  I'm like this with my face in my hands.
[01:01:11.224 --> 01:01:13.987]  And at that moment I'm shot by tasers.
[01:01:14.788 --> 01:01:16.430]  So I'm in excruciating pain.
[01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:20.974]  I couldn't even control my body anymore because when you're hit with these tasers you're paralyzed.
[01:01:21.415 --> 01:01:23.817]  And so I couldn't even, my hand came down to my face.
[01:01:23.837 --> 01:01:25.379]  I was trying to put my hand back in front of my face.
[01:01:25.419 --> 01:01:26.680]  I couldn't even control my arm.
[01:01:27.161 --> 01:01:28.542]  I'm screaming in pain.
[01:01:29.143 --> 01:01:30.604]  I'm shot with another taser.
[01:01:31.565 --> 01:01:53.393]  One guy from the Border Patrol grabs my head and basically shoves it into the driver door where the broken glass was where they had just busted out the window and I could just feel the glass shoving into the side of my head here as he just jammed my face into that side of that door and held it there for a little while.
[01:01:53.513 --> 01:01:58.375]  It's hard for me to measure the time because I was in so much pain it felt like it was taking forever.
[01:01:59.025 --> 01:02:01.627]  But it was, I mean, this definitely was taking some time.
[01:02:02.048 --> 01:02:04.510]  Then they grabbed me, threw me on the ground.
[01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:08.253]  Another officer stepped on my head.
[01:02:10.534 --> 01:02:11.175]  Big Brother.
[01:02:11.836 --> 01:02:12.896]  Mainstream media.
[01:02:13.597 --> 01:02:14.738]  Government cover-ups.
[01:02:15.358 --> 01:02:16.179]  You want answers?
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:17.961]  Well, so does he.
[01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:22.124]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:02:22.704 --> 01:02:26.748]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:02:29.065 --> 01:02:31.027]  You know, this is the issue of jurisdiction.
[01:02:31.987 --> 01:02:33.629]  Jurisdiction means what government can do.
[01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:35.150]  Now you've got federal police.
[01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:37.071]  They don't use warrants anymore.
[01:02:37.472 --> 01:02:39.053]  They taser you if you talk back.
[01:02:39.093 --> 01:02:40.354]  They have internal checkpoints.
[01:02:40.414 --> 01:02:41.755]  In fact, Google this.
[01:02:41.795 --> 01:02:42.776]  They have federal maps.
[01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:44.157]  Constitution Free Zone.
[01:02:44.197 --> 01:02:45.918]  Show folks the national map.
[01:02:45.938 --> 01:02:47.399]  The ACLU is actually accurate on this.
[01:02:47.419 --> 01:02:48.220]  They have a good map of it.
[01:02:49.361 --> 01:02:51.362]  And people are driving to work and stuff and they're sick of this.
[01:02:51.422 --> 01:02:53.584]  Every day they pull in and they go, we want to search you.
[01:02:53.604 --> 01:02:58.308]  But then I covered CNN earlier in the show where the illegal aliens, they have fake raids.
[01:02:59.531 --> 01:03:04.555]  They have fake raids of the illegal aliens, and pull that CNN up for people.
[01:03:05.215 --> 01:03:12.941]  They have these fake raids, and then take them to give them their green card after they have the staged raids for people watching United States television.
[01:03:12.961 --> 01:03:13.842]  Here it is, CNN.
[01:03:14.262 --> 01:03:16.544]  Illegal immigrants detained, then freed to work.
[01:03:16.564 --> 01:03:19.566]  And this article admits they then take them and
[01:03:21.007 --> 01:03:23.568]  Fill out their green cards and everything for them.
[01:03:24.208 --> 01:03:25.229]  And I've talked to Austin cops.
[01:03:25.249 --> 01:03:29.911]  They arrest a citizen without a driver's license, drunk driving, without insurance, they arrest you.
[01:03:30.351 --> 01:03:31.751]  The illegal aliens, they let them go.
[01:03:32.632 --> 01:03:33.372]  This happened one night.
[01:03:33.432 --> 01:03:35.373]  One of my guys had an expired driver's license.
[01:03:35.413 --> 01:03:36.833]  I saw him pulled over in front of the office.
[01:03:37.194 --> 01:03:37.934]  He pulled in the office.
[01:03:37.954 --> 01:03:40.875]  They thought that was suspicious, pulling into the office at night, like 8 at night.
[01:03:41.195 --> 01:03:41.675]  I pull up.
[01:03:41.715 --> 01:03:42.376]  He's in handcuffs.
[01:03:42.396 --> 01:03:43.016]  We put him in a car.
[01:03:43.036 --> 01:03:45.197]  I come up and they go, Hey, Alex, we like the show.
[01:03:45.477 --> 01:03:47.758]  Yeah, we don't arrest illegals because the judge is getting mad.
[01:03:47.798 --> 01:03:48.458]  They just let them go.
[01:03:48.478 --> 01:03:50.359]  But citizens, yeah, we're told, take them in.
[01:03:51.059 --> 01:03:54.221]  So, he pulls up to this federal checkpoint.
[01:03:54.281 --> 01:03:57.283]  They have these things, again, in some cases over 100 miles in.
[01:03:57.523 --> 01:03:59.244]  Before my grandfather died, he got real mad.
[01:03:59.264 --> 01:04:04.248]  He was driving around in the hill country, visiting his sister once, and Border Patrol pulls him over.
[01:04:04.268 --> 01:04:08.170]  This is outside Austin, you know, 200 and something miles from the border, and asks him if he was a U.S.
[01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:08.550]  citizen.
[01:04:09.491 --> 01:04:16.576]  So, again, it's their excuse to harass citizens, nobody else, and we have a, I'm going to finish your story of the TSA,
[01:04:17.867 --> 01:04:22.992]  Secret police interrogating you about your camera, what's your film, trying to break the camera, laughing about it.
[01:04:23.973 --> 01:04:30.679]  They literally, I've seen them with good looking women, they just, mmm, they start grabbing and it's all part of a ritual of service to them.
[01:04:31.259 --> 01:04:35.123]  I dominate you, I urinate on you, it's like a dog hugging its leg.
[01:04:36.023 --> 01:04:37.385]  And this is what tyranny is.
[01:04:37.825 --> 01:04:42.451]  It's just all these do-nothing scum ruling us, and then all the big criminals on top.
[01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:46.635]  But I wanted to go to Pastor Steven L. Anderson that this happened to.
[01:04:46.936 --> 01:04:49.459]  Mr. Anderson, it's good to have you here with us.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:51.301]  Good to be here, thank you.
[01:04:52.358 --> 01:04:54.319]  Okay, finish up, because we just played some of the clip.
[01:04:54.939 --> 01:04:56.059]  And a lot of people are doing this.
[01:04:56.079 --> 01:05:03.482]  I'm sure you've now noticed the videos are all over online, all over the country in Washington State and Vermont and Minnesota.
[01:05:04.603 --> 01:05:06.964]  People will be 100 miles in, 50 miles in.
[01:05:06.984 --> 01:05:07.884]  They're trying to drive to work.
[01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:09.344]  You've got to drive through a checkpoint.
[01:05:09.645 --> 01:05:10.565]  They want to search you.
[01:05:10.585 --> 01:05:11.805]  They want you to answer questions.
[01:05:11.825 --> 01:05:12.766]  People get sick of it.
[01:05:12.986 --> 01:05:14.226]  This isn't Nazi Germany.
[01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:16.807]  That happened to you.
[01:05:16.927 --> 01:05:18.708]  You question them and tell folks what happened.
[01:05:20.322 --> 01:05:22.702]  Well, do you want me to just start at the beginning and go through the whole story?
[01:05:23.803 --> 01:05:28.704]  Or do you want me to just tell the critical part about where they actually started to beat me and attack me?
[01:05:29.104 --> 01:05:36.265]  Tell the critical part and now since this happened a week ago, I'm sure you know there's probably a million views or more of all the versions of the video up on the web.
[01:05:36.305 --> 01:05:38.446]  What type of response you've seen from this?
[01:05:39.286 --> 01:05:41.126]  Well, let me take you to the most critical point.
[01:05:41.446 --> 01:05:43.987]  You know, we basically had a standoff for about 75 minutes.
[01:05:45.143 --> 01:05:45.724]  I don't think so.
[01:06:07.728 --> 01:06:12.530]  And, uh, they come up and they, you know, they're going to take me out of the car so that they can get in and search this car.
[01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:17.212]  Now, you were explaining to them that this was a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[01:06:18.352 --> 01:06:18.992]  Absolutely.
[01:06:19.072 --> 01:06:19.673]  Repeatedly.
[01:06:20.733 --> 01:06:30.997]  And so, they, uh, they basically tricked me into thinking that they were just going to knock out the passenger window, which I'm thinking to myself, okay, a couple hundred bucks for a new window.
[01:06:31.017 --> 01:06:32.277]  No, they were going to punish you.
[01:06:32.597 --> 01:06:33.818]  They were going to punish you, but go ahead.
[01:06:34.918 --> 01:06:35.158]  Right.
[01:06:35.318 --> 01:06:37.959]  You know, I'm thinking to myself, a couple hundred bucks, but you know what?
[01:06:38.079 --> 01:06:42.481]  I'm not going to back down here, because, you know, this is the right of every American at stake.
[01:06:42.781 --> 01:06:44.661]  You know, you give them a finger, they take the whole hand.
[01:06:44.882 --> 01:06:46.642]  You know, you give them an inch, they take a mile.
[01:06:47.022 --> 01:07:00.367]  So I'm sitting there, and then the Border Patrol agents are crowded around my car to the left of me, and, you know, they've already been trying to intimidate me for the last hour and 15 minutes, but they told me, they said, cover your eyes, because there's going to be broken glass.
[01:07:01.207 --> 01:07:03.088]  So I go ahead and put my hands over my eyes,
[01:07:03.649 --> 01:07:05.090]  Put my face down in my lap.
[01:07:05.570 --> 01:07:08.612]  Hardly a good position to be in when you get attacked.
[01:07:08.892 --> 01:07:10.993]  But I've got my eyes covered.
[01:07:11.033 --> 01:07:11.674]  I'm bent down.
[01:07:12.254 --> 01:07:18.518]  And not only did the passenger window break, but the driver's side window a few inches from my head broke simultaneously.
[01:07:19.098 --> 01:07:19.778]  Out of nowhere.
[01:07:20.118 --> 01:07:22.000]  Now, Pastor, you made a key point, though.
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:24.121]  You made a key point in psych warfare, they teach them.
[01:07:25.101 --> 01:07:30.284]  Before they invaded Panama for six months, they would land the helicopters, land the helicopters, take off to acclimate.
[01:07:30.845 --> 01:07:32.646]  That's what the knocking with the hammer
[01:07:33.499 --> 01:07:33.879]  Was.
[01:07:33.959 --> 01:07:34.199]  Right.
[01:07:34.419 --> 01:07:35.340]  So that's the window.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:38.441]  So you just got acclimated to the knocking of the hammer.
[01:07:38.481 --> 01:07:39.801]  It's all animal training.
[01:07:39.841 --> 01:07:40.961]  We're all seen as animals.
[01:07:41.001 --> 01:07:45.783]  And the cops are manipulated with basic animal psychology themselves in their own gang grid.
[01:07:46.003 --> 01:07:47.343]  So it's all brainwashing.
[01:07:47.863 --> 01:07:49.044]  And then there's the lie.
[01:07:49.204 --> 01:07:50.364]  Then there's the lie.
[01:07:50.424 --> 01:07:51.064]  Cover your eyes.
[01:07:51.104 --> 01:07:51.945]  We care about you.
[01:07:52.205 --> 01:07:54.646]  That's really just so they see where your hands are in case you've got a weapon.
[01:07:54.966 --> 01:07:55.786]  Then they taser.
[01:07:55.826 --> 01:07:57.847]  Then there's the other pleasure taser.
[01:07:57.927 --> 01:07:59.507]  The added Satanism enjoyment.
[01:07:59.887 --> 01:08:01.808]  And then there's the stomping on the head and everything else.
[01:08:01.828 --> 01:08:02.248]  But go ahead.
[01:08:03.468 --> 01:08:25.502]  Let me emphasize this, the electricity never stopped throughout this encounter because when they hit you with that 50,000 volt X26 taser, which I read that model number off of one of the tasers that I saw, you know, when they hit you with that, there's these two little metal probes that go into your flesh and there are wires and what happens is when they do that, they can just keep pulling the trigger
[01:08:26.118 --> 01:08:30.439]  In order to extend the length of it, so they can keep you electrified for as long as they want.
[01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:49.063]  Well that's why so many people die, because, because, because this sadistic enjoyment, you see the cops' faces when they, you know, the, you know, when they test it for the public, it's just a little jolt when they show it to themselves, but when they hit you with like the, don't tase me bro, and they go, no you're gonna get punished, you're gonna get tortured, it just goes on and on and on, and you see them going,
[01:08:50.416 --> 01:08:51.297]  Oh God, I hate America.
[01:08:51.777 --> 01:09:01.765]  I used to be really disturbed by that Don't Tase Me Bro video, but it seemed pretty mild the other day when I watched it, because, I mean, this went on and on.
[01:09:02.225 --> 01:09:12.132]  So here I am, in the, you know, I have my eyes covered, I'm not fighting back, I haven't lifted a finger, I haven't threatened anything, I'm just sitting there, you know, they say cover my eyes, I cover my eyes.
[01:09:12.272 --> 01:09:15.815]  Were they cussing at you and having little victories against freedom?
[01:09:16.035 --> 01:09:17.897]  Little hoots and noises?
[01:09:18.377 --> 01:09:19.578]  Or was it silent?
[01:09:21.277 --> 01:09:24.598]  You know, it's... You mean from the offices?
[01:09:24.618 --> 01:09:25.318]  I don't know.
[01:09:25.458 --> 01:09:26.998]  All I heard was my own screaming.
[01:09:27.038 --> 01:09:27.758]  That's all I could hear.
[01:09:27.778 --> 01:09:28.338]  You know what I mean?
[01:09:29.299 --> 01:09:35.240]  So, here I am, you know, just hazed, and you're totally paralyzed when you're hazed anyway.
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.240]  So I'm being electrified here.
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.740]  Glass flew at me from both sides.
[01:09:39.861 --> 01:09:46.722]  Next thing I know, a hand comes from the left and just shoves my head into the broken glass that was just busted out of the window.
[01:09:47.665 --> 01:09:53.826]  So I could feel that glass just shoving into my scalp, and my face was just jammed against the door with that glass.
[01:09:53.846 --> 01:09:55.487]  And that's what the wounds to my head are.
[01:09:56.067 --> 01:10:04.509]  It's from when the agent shoved my head into that broken glass on the door, and that just held it there while the electricity never stopped.
[01:10:04.529 --> 01:10:06.249]  A little bit of time went by.
[01:10:06.269 --> 01:10:11.011]  It's hard for me to measure the time, but the door then is open, the driver's side door.
[01:10:11.191 --> 01:10:12.531]  I fall out onto the ground.
[01:10:13.007 --> 01:10:17.091]  And a Border Patrol agent steps on my head with what felt like all his weight.
[01:10:17.531 --> 01:10:20.434]  And again, the electricity is never stopping throughout all of this, okay?
[01:10:20.935 --> 01:10:24.638]  And I'm just laying there screaming for mercy with somebody standing on my head.
[01:10:25.219 --> 01:10:30.984]  And it's funny because when I was in high school, we had to read a book, it required reading, 1984 by George Orwell.
[01:10:31.785 --> 01:10:36.970]  While I'm laying there with this guy stepping on my head, a quote from the book just randomly pops into my mind.
[01:10:37.688 --> 01:10:41.492]  And this is when the evil government guy is torturing the main character.
[01:10:41.892 --> 01:10:47.377]  He said, if you want a vision of the future, just imagine a boot stamping upon a human face.
[01:10:48.438 --> 01:10:48.858]  Forever.
[01:10:49.058 --> 01:10:51.120]  You know, and I remember that quote popped into my mind.
[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:52.061]  Yeah, that's O'Brien.
[01:10:52.161 --> 01:10:52.922]  That's O'Brien.
[01:10:53.783 --> 01:10:54.083]  Right.
[01:10:54.363 --> 01:11:03.031]  And while I'm laying there with somebody standing on my head, the electricity's not stopping, the glass is still, you know, shoving into my head from being stepped on.
[01:11:04.002 --> 01:11:10.427]  And while I'm laying there, you know, I mean, I'm just thinking to myself, what do I have to do to get these people to stop?
[01:11:10.888 --> 01:11:12.489]  Don't they see I'm not resisting?
[01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:15.151]  And I'm just thinking, do they want me to scream?
[01:11:15.171 --> 01:11:16.493]  Do they want me to be silent?
[01:11:17.053 --> 01:11:18.134]  What are they looking for?
[01:11:18.214 --> 01:11:20.936]  Just what do I have to do to get them to stop torturing me?
[01:11:20.956 --> 01:11:21.156]  No, no.
[01:11:21.217 --> 01:11:24.359]  What else does O'Brien say to Winston when they're torturing him and electrocuting him?
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.700]  They said, Winston...
[01:11:26.681 --> 01:11:28.241]  This is about destroying humanity.
[01:11:28.902 --> 01:11:32.602]  Always trampling over people, stomping on people, controlling them.
[01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:33.683]  We're the priest of power.
[01:11:34.163 --> 01:11:36.984]  We like to hurt people and hurt each other.
[01:11:37.444 --> 01:11:39.664]  That's the whole object of this, Winston.
[01:11:40.164 --> 01:11:45.026]  So, what mattered was... And these guys have a nose for this.
[01:11:45.046 --> 01:11:46.946]  If you're a drug dealer or a scum, they let you go.
[01:11:47.606 --> 01:11:48.206]  And I've seen it.
[01:11:48.786 --> 01:11:50.547]  But, especially because you're a...
[01:11:51.718 --> 01:11:54.699]  King James Version, Pastor, know about the corruption.
[01:11:54.759 --> 01:11:55.900]  It's a spiritual thing.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.901]  And I've seen the video of these guys.
[01:11:59.021 --> 01:12:03.583]  A lot of these guys are on the drug take, especially the ones with the drug checkpoints.
[01:12:04.503 --> 01:12:05.604]  These are all the pot-bellied ones.
[01:12:05.624 --> 01:12:06.244]  We'll be right back.
[01:12:08.285 --> 01:12:09.145]  You are a rebel.
[01:12:09.445 --> 01:12:09.846]  Admit it.
[01:12:10.186 --> 01:12:12.967]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[01:12:13.167 --> 01:12:15.228]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[01:12:15.548 --> 01:12:19.270]  Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:20.290]  Your neighbors call
[01:12:25.418 --> 01:12:26.559]  Alex Jones is working to save that very country.
[01:12:26.579 --> 01:12:27.780]  So go ahead, be a rebel.
[01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:29.642]  Put in a food supply from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:12:29.702 --> 01:12:32.104]  Everyone will realize you were not a nutcase after all.
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:01.926]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:13:13.772 --> 01:13:19.133]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:13:19.653 --> 01:13:25.855]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:13:26.175 --> 01:13:27.975]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:13:28.135 --> 01:13:30.516]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:13:30.596 --> 01:13:41.478]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:13:43.783 --> 01:13:45.044]  It's not about left or right.
[01:13:45.444 --> 01:13:46.845]  It's about a one world government.
[01:13:47.306 --> 01:13:53.650]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:14:02.476 --> 01:14:03.637]  The Obama Deception.
[01:14:04.057 --> 01:14:05.238]  The people strike back.
[01:14:07.446 --> 01:14:10.147]  Are you tired of losing your hard-earned savings in retirement?
[01:14:10.548 --> 01:14:17.111]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[01:14:17.591 --> 01:14:21.854]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.
[01:14:22.394 --> 01:14:31.939]  Call me at 800-686-2237, extension 115, and I will explain to you how to retain your wealth and purchasing power now and in the future with gold and silver.
[01:14:32.372 --> 01:14:42.100]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years, compared to our present fiat currency, which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[01:14:42.441 --> 01:14:49.827]  Call me, Duane Daly, at 800-686-2237, extension 115, to start your protection of wealth today.
[01:14:50.367 --> 01:14:53.250]  I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.
[01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:56.034]  No amount is too small, so start today.
[01:14:56.535 --> 01:15:02.225]  Call Duane Daly with Midas Resources at 800-686-2237, extension 115, for your gold and silver protection portfolio.
[01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:08.424]  So you want to stop smoking?
[01:15:08.465 --> 01:15:09.586]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[01:15:09.746 --> 01:15:12.508]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:16.452]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[01:15:16.612 --> 01:15:20.156]  And if and only if you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it?
[01:15:20.396 --> 01:15:22.338]  Most likely, if you tried this, you'd be arrested.
[01:15:22.398 --> 01:15:26.082]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the smoke-free free trial offer is.
[01:15:26.702 --> 01:15:33.467]  Smoke Free is a complete all-natural stop smoking system, and when you call today, they'll send you a 30-day supply of the program absolutely free!
[01:15:33.767 --> 01:15:41.793]  This program eliminates withdrawals and cravings, and includes a 30-day supply of the Smoke Free Capsules, a guide to living smoke-free book, and audio support program.
[01:15:42.293 --> 01:15:42.673]  I think so.
[01:16:22.789 --> 01:16:24.209]  Pastor Steven L. Anderson.
[01:16:25.569 --> 01:16:30.611]  Okay, so, uh, you're a pastor, you're also doing some construction work at Tools.
[01:16:31.811 --> 01:16:35.712]  So you're there, they're jumping on you, tasering you, they're having an enjoyment.
[01:16:37.179 --> 01:16:38.100]  How does this end?
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:39.741]  You end up going to jail.
[01:16:40.381 --> 01:16:43.463]  They always, in my experience, charge you with something.
[01:16:43.483 --> 01:16:45.645]  It's not enough to attack you with deadly weapons.
[01:16:45.665 --> 01:16:46.905]  There's also got to be a false charge.
[01:16:47.126 --> 01:16:48.386]  Has that happened?
[01:16:48.406 --> 01:16:49.227]  Boil it down for us.
[01:16:50.127 --> 01:16:50.368]  Yes.
[01:16:50.728 --> 01:16:53.089]  Two misdemeanors, and these are really laughable.
[01:16:54.190 --> 01:17:00.434]  Number one, I was charged with obstructing a public highway because of the fact that I did not allow them to search me.
[01:17:00.976 --> 01:17:07.299]  That caused this encounter to take so long that they're blaming me for that lane, you know, being obstructed.
[01:17:07.319 --> 01:17:11.781]  And they say that in all the videos, where the guy goes, you pull me over every day, Bill!
[01:17:12.401 --> 01:17:13.322]  You know I'm a U.S.
[01:17:13.342 --> 01:17:15.043]  citizen, pull over, I gotta search you!
[01:17:15.703 --> 01:17:20.665]  And I saw this on ferries, and I'm not saying Muslims are bad or terrorists, but I will never go back down to Bolivar again.
[01:17:21.385 --> 01:17:26.348]  I mean, I was a kid, there's the ferry, and there's literally people wearing, you know, the Palestinian
[01:17:27.408 --> 01:17:32.133]  You know, headdresses, the very weave, and all over the boat.
[01:17:32.594 --> 01:17:33.295]  And that didn't matter.
[01:17:33.375 --> 01:17:39.681]  Every time I'd go over, and there's not many restaurants, so we'd come back over with my kids, I was there like four days, to eat in Galveston.
[01:17:40.896 --> 01:17:42.917]  When they go back, they would always search us.
[01:17:43.518 --> 01:17:46.680]  And I noticed, because, see, they give them the directive.
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:47.741]  They don't even know why.
[01:17:47.841 --> 01:17:49.322]  It's to train the slaves.
[01:17:49.862 --> 01:17:51.423]  The Americans are the terrorists.
[01:17:51.703 --> 01:17:55.126]  And now we have this... Pastor, are you aware of the secret documents that have been leaked?
[01:17:55.166 --> 01:18:01.770]  We've leaked a lot of them, saying gun owners, Christians, Constitutionalists are really the terrorists and the number one threat to the government?
[01:18:02.951 --> 01:18:08.795]  Yes, I did hear that, and it's interesting, the timing of this happening, just what days after that came out in the news seemed like.
[01:18:09.312 --> 01:18:10.393]  Well, I'm looking at your picture.
[01:18:10.453 --> 01:18:12.234]  I mean, you know, this is pretty dangerous.
[01:18:12.674 --> 01:18:15.035]  Now, uh, so, so how did this end?
[01:18:15.055 --> 01:18:18.377]  I mean, were they, did they have any little celebrations when they put you in the car?
[01:18:18.417 --> 01:18:20.398]  Like, you idiot, you should have let us search you.
[01:18:20.418 --> 01:18:20.778]  Oh, yeah.
[01:18:20.798 --> 01:18:21.098]  Oh, yeah.
[01:18:21.138 --> 01:18:22.079]  Wait, wait till you hear this.
[01:18:22.539 --> 01:18:30.584]  So after I'm, I'm laying there in a pool of my own blood being stepped on and tasered repeatedly, this was the punishment section of, of what they were doing to me.
[01:18:30.664 --> 01:18:32.925]  You know, they were basically getting their vindication.
[01:18:33.485 --> 01:18:37.187]  Well, finally, thank God, you know, the electricity finally stopped.
[01:18:37.647 --> 01:18:38.608]  They get off my head.
[01:18:39.523 --> 01:18:42.685]  And I hear a chorus of voices saying, get up, get up, stand up!
[01:18:42.725 --> 01:18:44.706]  So I kind of stagger to my feet with their help.
[01:18:45.326 --> 01:18:47.287]  Blood gushing out of the side of my head.
[01:18:47.547 --> 01:18:53.971]  They cuffed me behind my back, put me in the trailer, and that's when three Border Patrol agents started laughing at me.
[01:18:54.571 --> 01:18:57.573]  Literally just laughing, mocking, oh, you're not so tough now.
[01:18:57.613 --> 01:18:59.174]  You didn't think we were going to search you, did we?
[01:18:59.194 --> 01:19:00.895]  Well, I guess we did get to search you.
[01:19:01.175 --> 01:19:02.556]  And guess what they found when they searched me?
[01:19:02.636 --> 01:19:02.996]  Nothing.
[01:19:03.587 --> 01:19:04.768]  They found nothing illegal.
[01:19:04.808 --> 01:19:05.909]  I wasn't doing anything wrong.
[01:19:05.969 --> 01:19:07.710]  I've never even been arrested in my life.
[01:19:07.730 --> 01:19:08.630]  But don't worry.
[01:19:08.670 --> 01:19:10.912]  They're going to have their pension funds taken.
[01:19:11.192 --> 01:19:13.213]  They're going to have their children's futures destroyed.
[01:19:13.493 --> 01:19:15.855]  They're enjoying all the vaccines they give their kids.
[01:19:15.895 --> 01:19:17.756]  They're going to enjoy having their kids in diapers when they're 30.
[01:19:18.737 --> 01:19:20.798]  They're going to get all the curses they want, too.
[01:19:21.158 --> 01:19:24.761]  Because this is the new... Pastor, do you know what the New World Order is?
[01:19:25.821 --> 01:19:27.502]  Yes.
[01:19:27.562 --> 01:19:32.786]  I'm familiar with... Actually, I've never listened to your show, but I've watched many of your films, and I think they're great.
[01:19:33.715 --> 01:19:37.818]  Well, what was it like to live the police state?
[01:19:38.178 --> 01:19:39.839]  It was just what you just said.
[01:19:39.979 --> 01:19:42.741]  I was living your film on the police state.
[01:19:43.401 --> 01:19:44.142]  I was right there.
[01:19:45.002 --> 01:19:47.584]  And I'm so sick of hearing the word conspiracy theory.
[01:19:47.944 --> 01:19:49.645]  I think if I hear it again, I'm going to throw up.
[01:19:50.066 --> 01:19:54.729]  Because I want somebody to look at my bloodied up face on YouTube and then tell me it's a theory.
[01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:59.314]  About, uh, the fact that, you know, this country's turning into a police state.
[01:19:59.414 --> 01:20:07.642]  Now, Pastor, how long did these celebrations go on, though, about how they destroyed the Fourth Amendment, annihilated what the veterans fought for, attacked a pastor?
[01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:10.405]  Then, they weren't low enough at that point.
[01:20:10.445 --> 01:20:14.910]  They had to just, you know, add the... just no honor.
[01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:17.993]  They had to add the icing of thuggishness to it.
[01:20:19.042 --> 01:20:27.964]  Right, and as they're wiping the blood, they had rubber gloves on, but they still had blood, you know, on their gloves, up their wrists, they had blood all over themselves.
[01:20:28.524 --> 01:20:34.405]  And then they start asking me if I have HIV, and they're joking with me and laughing at me and mocking me.
[01:20:34.505 --> 01:20:36.905]  It's all about dehumanizing you.
[01:20:36.945 --> 01:20:37.906]  I don't know how long it was.
[01:20:38.366 --> 01:20:40.586]  So it was a great celebration of evil, okay.
[01:20:40.906 --> 01:20:45.587]  Because the rest of their buddies were out searching my car during this time, turning up nothing.
[01:20:46.331 --> 01:20:51.134]  Well, you're lucky you didn't smart off at that point, or there would have been some weapons and drugs found in there, their main product.
[01:20:51.174 --> 01:21:15.531]  You know, finally at one point, after just this went on and on, because I was just sitting there silently for most of it, just really shook up, obviously, finally I did get a little angry and said, you know, because this is what made me finally, you know, get upset, even in my position of being handcuffed and bloodied and everything, is when the guy walked up to me, you know, CD as, he comes up to me and says,
[01:21:16.147 --> 01:21:18.512]  If you would have just answered the questions, we would have let you go.
[01:21:18.532 --> 01:21:23.140]  Oh yeah, the Nazis, when they were torturing people, always made it your fault.
[01:21:23.441 --> 01:21:24.543]  Oh, so it is your fault?
[01:21:24.643 --> 01:21:25.104]  Go ahead.
[01:21:25.985 --> 01:21:26.486]  There was no fault.
[01:21:26.506 --> 01:21:28.711]  No one said they're sorry that it happened.
[01:21:30.531 --> 01:21:31.192]  Well, stay there.
[01:21:31.212 --> 01:21:32.492]  I want to come back and finish up with this.
[01:21:32.512 --> 01:21:33.753]  We appreciate you coming on the show.
[01:21:34.333 --> 01:21:36.634]  But my guys just went through hell in Boston.
[01:21:36.654 --> 01:21:40.075]  I mean, they had foreigners who could hardly speak English going, what camera?
[01:21:41.276 --> 01:21:42.136]  Are you terrorists?
[01:21:42.176 --> 01:21:47.558]  And, like, grabbing other people that had cameras and, like, saying they were together, other guys, and just jabbing the Americans.
[01:21:47.698 --> 01:21:48.639]  You work for us now!
[01:21:48.779 --> 01:21:49.259]  Ha ha ha!
[01:21:49.439 --> 01:21:50.720]  We train you how to be safe!
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:51.160]  Ha ha ha!
[01:21:57.273 --> 01:21:58.174]  We're on the march.
[01:21:58.655 --> 01:22:00.277]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:22:01.179 --> 01:22:04.043]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:07.748 --> 01:22:10.312]  In the New World Order's war against humanity.
[01:22:10.925 --> 01:22:13.047]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:13.548 --> 01:22:20.556]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:27.303]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:27.703 --> 01:22:29.544]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:29.684 --> 01:22:32.106]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:32.186 --> 01:22:43.133]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:43.754 --> 01:22:45.054]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:45.435 --> 01:22:46.836]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:53.520]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:23:02.451 --> 01:23:03.591]  The Obama Deception.
[01:23:04.031 --> 01:23:05.232]  The people strike back!
[01:23:07.139 --> 01:23:14.102]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:23:14.342 --> 01:23:18.644]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:23:18.904 --> 01:23:24.006]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[01:23:24.506 --> 01:23:31.609]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:23:32.049 --> 01:23:35.350]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the
[01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:36.030]  I think so.
[01:24:03.022 --> 01:24:13.706]  Did you know that the new energy czar wants to control how much power your electrical company allows you to have?
[01:24:14.026 --> 01:24:14.627]  It's true.
[01:24:14.947 --> 01:24:20.149]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:24:20.549 --> 01:24:21.929]  Not if, but when.
[01:24:23.490 --> 01:24:27.891]  I just wanted to call in and let you folks know that I got my solar backup generator hooked up and running.
[01:24:28.091 --> 01:24:29.692]  To tell you the truth, it's awesome!
[01:24:29.892 --> 01:24:35.134]  Not only was it easy to install, but it's powering my fridge, lights, TV, and shortwave radio.
[01:24:35.894 --> 01:24:38.435]  I now know that I'm one step closer to getting off the grid.
[01:24:38.735 --> 01:24:39.535]  Thanks for all your help!
[01:24:39.895 --> 01:24:47.179]  This generator is solar powered, complete with battery backup, has no moving parts to wear out or break, and requires no gas.
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:51.062]  Don't wait for the Energy Czar to cut your power or raise your rates.
[01:24:51.322 --> 01:24:53.543]  Produce your own electricity for free.
[01:24:53.763 --> 01:24:55.825]  Go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:24:56.045 --> 01:24:58.346]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:24:58.606 --> 01:24:59.087]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:24:59.107 --> 01:24:59.147]  877-327-0365.
[01:25:28.134 --> 01:25:31.556]  We're going to go back to the pastor in a moment, but you guys keep telling me how this went on and on.
[01:25:31.576 --> 01:25:38.278]  It's like attacking old ladies, bossing people around, like when you had your shoes off, being humiliated, like telling you to hurry up.
[01:25:39.379 --> 01:25:42.640]  Listen, I'm scared to fly through because I'm scared of myself.
[01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:45.181]  I wouldn't put up with it again, but I flew in from England.
[01:25:45.462 --> 01:25:52.645]  My parents flew in from England into Houston because that's where you take the Continental 777s over there is the best way to fly.
[01:25:53.655 --> 01:26:04.622]  The people at the Houston one, they're screaming at everyone, everyone's scared, groveling, and they're just like nuts, foreigners, and every form of, you know, just person on power trips.
[01:26:05.203 --> 01:26:09.446]  Because that's what's so bizarre, it's not just citizens screaming at you, it's obvious, people can't even speak English.
[01:26:09.706 --> 01:26:11.407]  And they're just like, hurry up, get it out!
[01:26:11.627 --> 01:26:12.788]  And everybody's just like, oh yes!
[01:26:13.328 --> 01:26:19.613]  And old ladies, groveling on their crutches, and I'm not exaggerating, it's like five, six years ago.
[01:26:20.473 --> 01:26:22.235]  I'm in San Francisco on a connecting flight.
[01:26:22.255 --> 01:26:24.078]  I think I'm coming back from L.A.
[01:26:24.198 --> 01:26:25.460]  or something, but I went through San Francisco first.
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:26.161]  I don't remember.
[01:26:26.201 --> 01:26:27.743]  The point is, I'm in San Francisco.
[01:26:29.332 --> 01:26:31.653]  And it was called Wolverine Security.
[01:26:31.994 --> 01:26:33.114]  You can check into this, folks.
[01:26:33.134 --> 01:26:34.075]  I don't know if they're still there.
[01:26:34.135 --> 01:26:37.197]  But it was like bright blue, Cobra Commander colored fatigues.
[01:26:37.337 --> 01:26:39.378]  Boots, blouse, tucked in.
[01:26:39.758 --> 01:26:41.799]  Looked like Nazi uniforms from science fiction.
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:43.480]  And these berets.
[01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:49.023]  And they were like jabbing old people getting on a flight to Hawaii, going, HAKALUDA!
[01:26:49.284 --> 01:26:51.285]  And I was like, and I almost went over there.
[01:26:51.305 --> 01:26:53.586]  I was like, the humiliation of it.
[01:26:53.866 --> 01:26:55.767]  And these were old vets going to a...
[01:26:57.208 --> 01:27:03.290]  They all had, you know, Survivor of the, of the, um, what was the name of the battleship that went to the bottom, you know?
[01:27:03.330 --> 01:27:18.495]  Survivor of the Arizona and all this, and literally, you can tell somebody's about to die in that little oxygen tank, you know, where the eyes are going like that, and the red's like sagging down, and the guy's got hearing aids on, there's a couple more, he's got like some wife who's the young one who's only 80, and he's like, I'M GOING BACK TO YOU!
[01:27:18.855 --> 01:27:23.337]  And like, just, and I'm going, because they were searching you when you went through the checkpoint, and again, at the planes!
[01:27:24.864 --> 01:27:27.128]  And I just realized, I said, this country's gone, man.
[01:27:27.689 --> 01:27:30.193]  I mean, that is what this is, is slave training.
[01:27:30.553 --> 01:27:36.663]  Now, folks, tell him fast, because I want to go back to the pastor and I want to take a few calls, the entire thing of what happened to you in Boston.
[01:27:36.957 --> 01:27:38.577]  Well, it's the same routine every time.
[01:27:38.597 --> 01:27:40.458]  You've got to basically strip search.
[01:27:40.538 --> 01:27:42.498]  Not quite, but... That's humiliation training.
[01:27:42.618 --> 01:27:43.519]  Oh, it's very degrading.
[01:27:43.539 --> 01:27:44.439]  Submission training.
[01:27:44.539 --> 01:27:46.719]  Some of them have apologized to me on other occasions.
[01:27:47.159 --> 01:27:49.600]  And then they bring you through... Well, you said apologize.
[01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:51.941]  They go, I apologize, but is this microphone deadly?
[01:27:52.261 --> 01:27:53.041]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:27:53.721 --> 01:27:58.882]  And I was saying at the break, if the military are supposed to be the best and brightest, these are the dullest and most dim-witted.
[01:27:58.902 --> 01:28:03.223]  And they're always pointing at the screening, you know, the x-ray machine.
[01:28:03.263 --> 01:28:03.803]  What's that?
[01:28:03.943 --> 01:28:04.864]  What do you think?
[01:28:04.904 --> 01:28:06.204]  Does that look okay to you?
[01:28:07.131 --> 01:28:10.995]  Every time I go through, so they do that and I'm like, there's your bag, come over here.
[01:28:11.475 --> 01:28:13.116]  It's all this monosyllabic.
[01:28:13.637 --> 01:28:14.458]  But tell him what he said.
[01:28:14.498 --> 01:28:14.978]  Describe it.
[01:28:15.378 --> 01:28:16.259]  She said it was real bossy.
[01:28:16.279 --> 01:28:19.882]  I'm like, Oh yeah, I didn't even have a time to put my shoes and belt back on.
[01:28:19.962 --> 01:28:20.903]  It's come over here.
[01:28:21.063 --> 01:28:21.964]  Explain this to me.
[01:28:22.044 --> 01:28:23.065]  What is this camera?
[01:28:23.085 --> 01:28:25.968]  And you know, we have all kinds of accessories and equipment.
[01:28:26.008 --> 01:28:28.090]  He wants to know about just about every piece of it.
[01:28:28.770 --> 01:28:32.994]  And he's playing with lenses that cost, you know, hundreds and thousands of dollars.
[01:28:33.678 --> 01:28:36.843]  And trying to screw it on backwards and upside down.
[01:28:37.604 --> 01:28:38.445]  He's like, what are you filming?
[01:28:38.786 --> 01:28:39.607]  Yeah, that's not enough.
[01:28:39.627 --> 01:28:40.949]  He wants to know what I'm working on.
[01:28:42.111 --> 01:28:43.132]  You said it was what you do.
[01:28:43.373 --> 01:28:44.494]  I mean, go to the imitation.
[01:28:45.894 --> 01:28:47.155]  Do like you do during the breaks, man.
[01:28:47.275 --> 01:28:49.657]  He did try to put you in collusion with the other guy, too.
[01:28:49.877 --> 01:28:51.378]  No, but you said he's like... Who's he?
[01:28:51.439 --> 01:28:52.059]  Who's he?
[01:28:52.159 --> 01:28:54.982]  I say, oh, well, you know, that's my partner pointing to Rob Dewey.
[01:28:55.022 --> 01:28:55.742]  No, not him!
[01:28:56.043 --> 01:28:57.824]  Guy in black jacket with camera.
[01:28:57.844 --> 01:28:58.765]  Yeah, black jacket with camera.
[01:28:58.825 --> 01:28:59.946]  And he wants to... What about him?
[01:28:59.966 --> 01:29:01.047]  Well, I don't know that guy.
[01:29:01.067 --> 01:29:02.068]  What are you talking about?
[01:29:02.829 --> 01:29:07.593]  They pull over the old lady with four balls of yarn and, at worst, a crochet needle and...
[01:29:09.911 --> 01:29:10.892]  It's terrible, Alex.
[01:29:11.092 --> 01:29:12.133]  And what's this?
[01:29:12.153 --> 01:29:13.273]  What are you filming for?
[01:29:13.373 --> 01:29:14.414]  No, but what is it?
[01:29:14.534 --> 01:29:15.335]  Who are you filming for?
[01:29:15.355 --> 01:29:16.235]  They said documentary.
[01:29:16.295 --> 01:29:16.736]  Who?
[01:29:16.896 --> 01:29:17.436]  Who?
[01:29:17.456 --> 01:29:17.516]  Who?
[01:29:18.157 --> 01:29:18.277]  Ah!
[01:29:18.517 --> 01:29:20.038]  Can you answer the question now?
[01:29:21.172 --> 01:29:22.433]  You answer question now!
[01:29:22.893 --> 01:29:24.074]  You answer my question!
[01:29:24.214 --> 01:29:25.234]  You answer now!
[01:29:25.435 --> 01:29:26.155]  Free speech!
[01:29:26.415 --> 01:29:27.015]  Answer!
[01:29:27.136 --> 01:29:27.696]  Answer it now!
[01:29:28.116 --> 01:29:28.817]  Answer it now!
[01:29:29.137 --> 01:29:29.637]  Slave!
[01:29:29.937 --> 01:29:33.479]  But I finally tell him free speech, and he kind of giggles.
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.361]  Listen you dirty American!
[01:29:36.601 --> 01:29:37.982]  We run this country now!
[01:29:38.262 --> 01:29:39.663]  Homeland Security!
[01:29:39.883 --> 01:29:41.264]  What you do with Kamala?
[01:29:41.424 --> 01:29:42.825]  You answer my question!
[01:29:44.786 --> 01:29:49.489]  You know, aside from getting... I mean, thank God nothing happened like with this pastor, but...
[01:29:50.157 --> 01:29:54.119]  I mean, it's basically the other lady's ordering me, move back now over here!
[01:29:54.939 --> 01:29:55.340]  Hurry up!
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:55.980]  Hurry up!
[01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:56.900]  It's a nightmare, Alex.
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:58.681]  I grabbed some trays from her, trying to help.
[01:29:58.701 --> 01:30:01.843]  This is our training to be slaves, and now they're doing it on the streets and everywhere else.
[01:30:02.883 --> 01:30:04.604]  I can't, every time it bothers me.
[01:30:04.964 --> 01:30:07.465]  I'm not, I have not... Listen, I don't pleasure fly anymore.
[01:30:07.485 --> 01:30:09.666]  I don't take my family on vacations on planes.
[01:30:10.107 --> 01:30:13.928]  How would I take my little children to be bossed around by scum?
[01:30:14.509 --> 01:30:17.050]  And then on top of it, um...
[01:30:18.447 --> 01:30:20.389]  I can't take them to the beach because they're doing it there.
[01:30:20.409 --> 01:30:23.831]  I mean, I can't do anything anymore.
[01:30:24.492 --> 01:30:27.154]  And then now they're setting up checkpoints on the streets doing this.
[01:30:27.815 --> 01:30:33.640]  Yeah, even the one time I did fly, there wasn't a trip for work here without any video equipment.
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:36.162]  Excuse me, sir, is this your bag?
[01:30:36.202 --> 01:30:38.263]  We found a tube of toothpaste.
[01:30:38.964 --> 01:30:39.564]  No liquids.
[01:30:39.725 --> 01:30:41.826]  And again, they always keep adding more and more.
[01:30:42.126 --> 01:30:43.608]  And then now it's questioning, lining up.
[01:30:44.824 --> 01:30:47.566]  We are going to discuss the contents of your bags.
[01:30:48.406 --> 01:30:49.567]  Are you Al Qaeda?
[01:30:49.947 --> 01:30:51.628]  I mean, it's just, it's incredible.
[01:30:51.648 --> 01:30:55.591]  Going back to Pastor Steve L. Anderson, where is it going from here now?
[01:30:56.851 --> 01:30:58.752]  I mean, they've given you false charges.
[01:30:58.772 --> 01:31:00.253]  You said there were two charges.
[01:31:00.333 --> 01:31:01.774]  One of them was them making you block the road.
[01:31:01.814 --> 01:31:02.355]  What's the next one?
[01:31:03.215 --> 01:31:05.797]  Right, and neither of these charges is even anything major.
[01:31:05.857 --> 01:31:06.937]  Just a couple misdemeanors.
[01:31:07.017 --> 01:31:12.381]  One was just blocking the road by not cooperating with the illegal search they were trying to do.
[01:31:12.961 --> 01:31:14.382]  And number two was
[01:31:14.898 --> 01:31:18.863]  Failure to obey the officer's order to open the door.
[01:31:19.483 --> 01:31:24.649]  So, you know, failing to obey and blocking the highway are the only things I'm being charged with.
[01:31:25.991 --> 01:31:32.038]  When reality... Failure to obey the criminal... I mean, can a cop come to your door and say, mow my lawn, failure to bail, arrest you?
[01:31:32.258 --> 01:31:33.380]  It's the Fourth Amendment!
[01:31:34.306 --> 01:31:38.308]  And they got these things a hundred mile... Okay, so what's the aftermath of this been like?
[01:31:38.328 --> 01:31:40.569]  You know, probably a million views on the web or more.
[01:31:41.069 --> 01:31:42.250]  What feedback have you gotten?
[01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:43.310]  Are they proud of themselves?
[01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:44.651]  Are you going to sue their lordships?
[01:31:46.072 --> 01:31:51.114]  Well, obviously, I mean, otherwise, who's going to pay for my stitches to my head?
[01:31:51.134 --> 01:31:54.575]  The 11 stitches is going to pay for my windows that I already had to pay to have replaced?
[01:31:54.936 --> 01:31:56.616]  I'm having to pay a lawyer to defend me?
[01:31:57.057 --> 01:32:02.039]  I mean, obviously, I've got to get retribution here, but not only that, what I want the most out of this
[01:32:02.859 --> 01:32:09.043]  Is for this to get out to as many people as possible, just to wake people up that this is happening in the United States.
[01:32:09.063 --> 01:32:12.065]  Because these guys didn't act like this was anything special.
[01:32:12.145 --> 01:32:15.428]  To them, it seemed to me that this was another day at the office.
[01:32:15.488 --> 01:32:16.428]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:32:16.508 --> 01:32:17.389]  This happens a lot.
[01:32:17.409 --> 01:32:23.753]  Sir, you haven't seen the hundreds, literally hundreds of videos of people that are sick of this a hundred miles into the country being searched.
[01:32:23.773 --> 01:32:26.255]  You haven't, I mean, had you seen all the people sick of this?
[01:32:26.535 --> 01:32:27.496]  This is a big phenomenon.
[01:32:28.464 --> 01:32:32.146]  Yeah, I've seen a few, but I'm telling you, we've got to get this out.
[01:32:32.326 --> 01:32:35.989]  And that's the biggest thing I want to see, is for people to blog this, use this.
[01:32:36.029 --> 01:32:41.973]  But what's wrong with internal checkpoints and World War II vets having foreigners jab and yell at them?
[01:32:42.013 --> 01:32:43.053]  I mean, that's freedom, sir.
[01:32:43.574 --> 01:32:46.235]  The veterans fought and died so we could live in a Nazi hell.
[01:32:48.236 --> 01:32:48.677]  Exactly.
[01:32:50.738 --> 01:32:53.240]  Well, now were they proud of themselves?
[01:32:55.652 --> 01:32:57.033]  What about the police at the station?
[01:32:57.253 --> 01:32:58.574]  Was this another celebration?
[01:32:59.914 --> 01:33:04.216]  In their mind, they won the battle by beating and humiliating and torturing me.
[01:33:04.817 --> 01:33:06.237]  Uncondemned, they won the battle.
[01:33:06.257 --> 01:33:15.142]  Now when it comes to the officers at the police station, once I got to the actual jail, I was driven 75 miles away to an emergency room.
[01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:18.262]  Where I was, uh, my head was stitched and so forth.
[01:33:18.603 --> 01:33:25.248]  The people at the hospital were kind of, you know, they could tell that I was well-spoken, I was a nice guy, and they seemed a little shocked.
[01:33:25.328 --> 01:33:26.229]  Why is this guy here?
[01:33:26.249 --> 01:33:27.030]  What have you done to him?
[01:33:27.050 --> 01:33:32.535]  Well, do you understand that whether you're Hispanic, black, white, any of it, we are the targets.
[01:33:32.695 --> 01:33:37.459]  Anybody who produces, anybody that works, they've gone, hey, these are suckers, they'll let us get away with anything.
[01:33:37.959 --> 01:33:39.220]  We'll just declare we're happy.
[01:33:40.216 --> 01:33:43.678]  When I was in the hospital, they asked me, they said, you know, what happened to you?
[01:33:43.878 --> 01:33:46.980]  And I just pointed at the DPS officer and said, well, ask him.
[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:48.220]  He's the one who did this to me.
[01:33:49.021 --> 01:33:52.622]  And he, oh, well, we had to get him out of the car, you know?
[01:33:53.083 --> 01:33:58.305]  But then when they took me down to the jail, you know, a few people were asking me questions while I was at the jail.
[01:33:58.906 --> 01:34:00.587]  And they said, why are you here?
[01:34:00.647 --> 01:34:02.408]  Why are you the one that got arrested?
[01:34:02.448 --> 01:34:05.709]  They're telling me I needed to sue and everything.
[01:34:05.729 --> 01:34:07.150]  That's what the jailer was telling me.
[01:34:08.285 --> 01:34:09.105]  Well, you know that.
[01:34:09.145 --> 01:34:10.766]  The jailor's telling me to sue them.
[01:34:11.067 --> 01:34:17.730]  Well, you know, you reap what you sow, and I hope these cops know all this comes back on them.
[01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:24.294]  I mean, really, I'm scared to screw somebody, not just because I'm a moral guy, but I won't do it because I know.
[01:34:24.314 --> 01:34:28.096]  I mean, you know, you don't just get judged when you die, Pastor, from my experience.
[01:34:28.136 --> 01:34:31.658]  You get judged for what you do in this life, and your family gets judged.
[01:34:31.698 --> 01:34:32.138]  Absolutely.
[01:34:32.759 --> 01:34:34.600]  It's going to come around to you in this life.
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:36.421]  You're going to reap what you sow, no matter who you are.
[01:34:37.628 --> 01:34:38.188]  Good or bad.
[01:34:38.469 --> 01:34:39.970]  You're going to reap what you sow in this life.
[01:34:40.810 --> 01:34:41.151]  For sure.
[01:34:41.751 --> 01:34:43.812]  Hey, can I talk a little bit about Romans 13?
[01:34:44.353 --> 01:34:47.155]  Because this is what people are throwing in my face, and it's really unbelievable.
[01:34:47.175 --> 01:34:48.856]  Oh yeah, no, I saw the comments.
[01:34:48.936 --> 01:34:52.238]  I saw the comments on there going, you should have followed the order.
[01:34:52.278 --> 01:34:53.039]  It's of the Lord.
[01:34:53.119 --> 01:34:54.180]  All government is of God.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:55.561]  Well then why did we fight Hitler?
[01:34:55.601 --> 01:34:56.902]  Why did the founders fight?
[01:34:57.122 --> 01:34:58.383]  Why were all the prophets
[01:34:58.923 --> 01:35:02.586]  I'm a pastor, you know, and I actually have Romans 13 memorized, in addition to almost half the New Testament, okay?
[01:35:02.646 --> 01:35:03.767]  And, first of all, let me say this.
[01:35:04.007 --> 01:35:09.010]  Many of these modern Bible versions are changing Romans 13, and if you look at them, they're changing the text.
[01:35:28.462 --> 01:35:30.023]  To give it an authoritarian feel.
[01:35:30.323 --> 01:35:39.067]  But if you read, you know, a King James Bible, Romans 13, the first words of the chapter are, let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.
[01:35:39.628 --> 01:35:42.249]  And of course, the highest power in this country is the U.S.
[01:35:42.269 --> 01:35:43.069]  Constitution.
[01:35:43.610 --> 01:35:46.431]  Not a border patrol officer or DPS officer.
[01:35:46.711 --> 01:35:54.215]  But not only that, as you read through the chapter, he's talking about rulers and laws, okay?
[01:35:54.695 --> 01:35:57.997]  He says, for rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.
[01:35:58.856 --> 01:36:07.463]  I think anyone will agree that a DPS officer or a Border Patrol agent is not a ruler or the supreme authority of our country.
[01:36:08.043 --> 01:36:19.992]  And so to sit there and say that I was disobeying authority because I wouldn't follow their unlawful command to search my car without a warrant, which violates the highest authority in this country, is laughable.
[01:36:20.353 --> 01:36:21.293]  And it's not what you said.
[01:36:22.134 --> 01:36:26.017]  If Romans 13 is telling us to blindly obey
[01:36:26.598 --> 01:36:27.158]  I don't know.
[01:36:44.929 --> 01:36:45.529]  But wait a minute.
[01:36:45.789 --> 01:36:48.810]  We're living in a time where our government is a terror.
[01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:51.271]  Hey, the government says abort 50 million babies.
[01:36:51.331 --> 01:36:53.472]  I guess that's a... Oh, it's a little more good.
[01:36:53.872 --> 01:36:56.013]  God most want us to kill babies.
[01:36:56.353 --> 01:36:57.214]  It's a cop-out.
[01:36:57.574 --> 01:37:01.055]  I'll blame the pastors in this country who are preaching that.
[01:37:01.715 --> 01:37:05.276]  You know, I don't even know what to say about them.
[01:37:05.336 --> 01:37:11.979]  I mean, it's wicked that they would actually have the gall to stand behind a pulpit and preach these kind of lies.
[01:37:12.458 --> 01:37:18.460]  But I also wanted to say something about, you know, the terrorists, because that's the other attack that's being thrown at me.
[01:37:18.721 --> 01:37:19.941]  What about 9-11?
[01:37:20.381 --> 01:37:26.564]  And they say, well, you know, because of 9-11, I guess I need to be tortured and beaten when I refuse to be a search.
[01:37:26.584 --> 01:37:31.746]  But it's funny, if you look at how the word terrorist got into our English language, it comes from French.
[01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:38.188]  The term terrorist was coined during the French Reign of Terror, you know, Revolutionary France, 1793.
[01:37:38.509 --> 01:37:39.509]  The government!
[01:37:39.529 --> 01:37:41.890]  That's where our English word terrorist comes from.
[01:37:42.552 --> 01:37:49.574]  And that was the government faction that instituted the reign of terror in France, was known as the terrorist faction.
[01:37:50.234 --> 01:37:57.936]  And then, and then Lenin, when he killed 20 million people before Stalin got in and killed double that, he called it the Red Terror and said it's essential.
[01:37:57.976 --> 01:38:06.639]  So yes, terror in its very definition in France and the Soviet Union, the two first uses, is government carrying out mass exterminations.
[01:38:07.884 --> 01:38:21.142]  Right, and again, if you study the French Reign of Terror, the executive branch of France at that time was called the Committee of Public Safety in 1793 to July 1794 with the Thermidorian Reaction.
[01:38:21.543 --> 01:38:23.065]  Okay, during that reign of terror,
[01:38:23.635 --> 01:38:25.456]  The government would be original terrorists.
[01:38:25.797 --> 01:38:27.298]  Because that's where the word comes from.
[01:38:28.298 --> 01:38:35.303]  Well, uh... The fact that you can read, Pastor, means you should probably be in the MIAC report or the federal report.
[01:38:35.343 --> 01:38:36.484]  You can read.
[01:38:37.105 --> 01:38:38.085]  France doesn't exist.
[01:38:38.145 --> 01:38:38.886]  That never existed.
[01:38:39.366 --> 01:38:40.547]  That's the only way the media handled it.
[01:38:40.567 --> 01:38:42.148]  You didn't cut all those people's heads off.
[01:38:42.248 --> 01:38:43.249]  I'm debunking that.
[01:38:43.349 --> 01:38:44.750]  Ithinas don't exist either.
[01:38:45.591 --> 01:38:47.312]  I just thought it was funny.
[01:38:47.352 --> 01:38:48.513]  It's always safety, you know?
[01:38:48.533 --> 01:38:51.515]  Because in revolutionary France, it was the Committee of Public Safety.
[01:38:51.995 --> 01:38:58.902]  And the people who beat the living fire out of me were the Department of Public Safety, which is what the Arizona Highway Patrol is called.
[01:38:58.922 --> 01:39:01.264]  Then there's the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:39:01.344 --> 01:39:02.926]  Sounds like the Committee of Public Safety.
[01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:07.445]  It sounds, and I'm wondering, you know, who is trying to terrify who here?
[01:39:07.925 --> 01:39:14.946]  I was accused by a border patrol agent, he said, because I asserted my Fourth Amendment right, he said, well, I'm pretty sure you're a terrorist.
[01:39:15.466 --> 01:39:17.647]  But they were the ones trying to terrify me.
[01:39:17.687 --> 01:39:22.528]  They were the ones surrounding my car, threatening me, and boy, those weren't idle threats.
[01:39:22.728 --> 01:39:22.968]  Hey!
[01:39:23.008 --> 01:39:25.589]  Take a look at my face and say it's an idle threat.
[01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:29.569]  Have you seen the new video of another guy when they threatened him with nunchucks at the window?
[01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:30.890]  No, that's me.
[01:39:30.910 --> 01:39:31.970]  That was me two months ago.
[01:39:33.393 --> 01:39:34.614]  That was me two months ago.
[01:39:34.774 --> 01:39:35.214]  That's me.
[01:39:35.234 --> 01:39:36.595]  Same guy.
[01:39:36.615 --> 01:39:37.836]  Same seven minute video.
[01:39:38.136 --> 01:39:39.437]  They showed you.
[01:39:39.918 --> 01:39:41.899]  Oh, so they were mad from then.
[01:39:42.199 --> 01:39:43.440]  Was this the same checkpoint?
[01:39:44.361 --> 01:39:45.082]  No, no.
[01:39:45.782 --> 01:39:47.003]  Hundreds of miles apart.
[01:39:47.283 --> 01:39:48.404]  But you have to understand.
[01:39:48.424 --> 01:39:50.465]  So they now menace you with nunchucks.
[01:39:51.066 --> 01:39:55.909]  Have you seen the video I've got of them breaking men and women's arms with nunchucks to teach them lessons?
[01:39:57.170 --> 01:39:57.711]  No, I haven't.
[01:39:59.494 --> 01:40:00.514]  I'm a business traveler.
[01:40:00.854 --> 01:40:02.395]  I've traveled for the last three years.
[01:40:02.535 --> 01:40:04.436]  I've traveled all over the United States every week.
[01:40:04.756 --> 01:40:07.018]  I've been through these checkpoints hundreds and hundreds of times.
[01:40:07.378 --> 01:40:08.899]  And they just wade through.
[01:40:09.359 --> 01:40:13.181]  But, you know, every once in a while, the law of absences, they're going to interrogate you.
[01:40:13.201 --> 01:40:14.141]  They're going to want to search you.
[01:40:14.201 --> 01:40:23.547]  And if you travel as much as I do, you know, you're going to get there at the wrong, you're going to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when they want to interrogate you and search you without a warrant.
[01:40:23.627 --> 01:40:25.287]  And they searched me.
[01:40:25.327 --> 01:40:26.008]  They found nothing.
[01:40:26.869 --> 01:40:28.729]  All right, Pastor, we're almost out of time.
[01:40:28.749 --> 01:40:29.750]  I've got to move quick here.
[01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:35.731]  Are you aware that they secretly recruited 13,000 preachers in 2006?
[01:40:35.891 --> 01:40:39.171]  It was secret, then they made it public as 26,000 preachers.
[01:40:39.651 --> 01:40:49.533]  The clergy response teams and FEMA secretly funds them to say, turn your guns in, go to FEMA camps, take inoculations, Romans 13, and that now it's been declassified?
[01:40:49.573 --> 01:40:54.034]  I mean, is that not the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany, where they covertly are hiring the preachers?
[01:40:55.265 --> 01:41:06.232]  Absolutely, and you know, it doesn't surprise me based on how these preachers have been preaching and twisting Romans 13 and the way that these modern Bible versions are changing the text.
[01:41:06.252 --> 01:41:14.258]  They're changing the very text of Romans 13 to make it fit their authoritarian, totalitarian government, you know, philosophy.
[01:41:14.838 --> 01:41:22.183]  You know, the King James Version weren't that different than these new ones that are being put out by these Bible societies or whatever they are.
[01:41:22.728 --> 01:41:34.876]  And these pastors who are basically selling out our country by telling us, be good little Christians and allow the abortion machine to go forward, the New World Order, the One World Government to go forward.
[01:41:35.596 --> 01:41:43.742]  How can you be a Christian or a preacher and not believe in what the Bible says is going to happen one day, you know, a One World Government?
[01:41:44.502 --> 01:41:45.423]  That's what I don't understand.
[01:41:47.344 --> 01:41:50.106]  Well, I want the sadists that did this to you to know
[01:41:51.857 --> 01:41:56.924]  That everything they're doing to you will be done to them ten times worse by the evil globalist above them.
[01:41:57.584 --> 01:41:59.266]  And so they can't escape judgment.
[01:42:00.208 --> 01:42:02.951]  And Pastor, is there a website we can visit?
[01:42:03.011 --> 01:42:04.093]  Or a YouTube channel?
[01:42:04.213 --> 01:42:06.536]  Or how do folks attend your church?
[01:42:06.596 --> 01:42:07.277]  I bet it's a good one.
[01:42:08.183 --> 01:42:11.424]  Well, first of all, we've got to get this video out there on YouTube.
[01:42:11.484 --> 01:42:13.184]  Just search Pastor Border Patrol.
[01:42:13.224 --> 01:42:13.824]  It's going to come up.
[01:42:14.224 --> 01:42:16.724]  Because this has got to get out to as many people as possible.
[01:42:16.744 --> 01:42:22.365]  We've got to get this thing viral so that it doesn't keep happening to other people who, you know, are less connected than I am, I guess.
[01:42:22.405 --> 01:42:31.567]  But also, the updates on the situation are on my wife's personal blog, which is stephenandersonfamily.blogspot.com.
[01:42:32.087 --> 01:42:35.448]  And then my church's website is faithfulwordbaptist.org.
[01:42:38.789 --> 01:42:44.554]  Yes, it's Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe, Arizona, which is right in the middle of Phoenix, right in the heart of Phoenix.
[01:42:44.834 --> 01:42:48.057]  ASU is in Tempe, Arizona State University.
[01:42:48.357 --> 01:42:48.658]  Alright.
[01:42:48.698 --> 01:42:50.399]  So that's where our church is located.
[01:42:50.439 --> 01:42:51.080]  Very populated.
[01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:52.961]  Pastor, fire out the website one more time.
[01:42:53.001 --> 01:42:54.182]  Fire out the website one more time.
[01:42:55.443 --> 01:42:59.767]  www.faithfulwordbaptist.org.
[01:43:00.187 --> 01:43:01.829]  Alright, we'll talk to you again and get an update.
[01:43:02.970 --> 01:43:04.071]  We'll get an update from you soon.
[01:43:04.091 --> 01:43:04.451]  Thank you, sir.
[01:43:04.471 --> 01:43:06.133]  Let me say bye to him during the break.
[01:43:06.809 --> 01:43:12.291]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[01:43:12.771 --> 01:43:13.492]  Think about that.
[01:43:13.532 --> 01:43:16.193]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[01:43:16.673 --> 01:43:19.594]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[01:43:19.874 --> 01:43:29.658]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious tasting, chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants.
[01:43:30.098 --> 01:43:35.682]  Unlike hard-to-digest pills, Choose for Health is a convenient chewable which allows for better digestion.
[01:43:35.942 --> 01:43:36.982]  The choice is yours.
[01:43:37.123 --> 01:43:42.406]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can better digest.
[01:43:42.726 --> 01:43:47.529]  Choose for Health, the world's first superfruit, sea vegetable, antioxidant chewable.
[01:43:47.809 --> 01:43:51.351]  Whole food nutrition, not rocks and shells.

[01:44:07.423 --> 01:44:12.667]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:18.802]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:44:19.342 --> 01:44:25.525]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:25.825 --> 01:44:27.646]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:27.806 --> 01:44:30.187]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:44:30.267 --> 01:44:41.151]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:44:43.442 --> 01:44:44.703]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:45.103 --> 01:44:46.503]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:44:46.963 --> 01:44:53.306]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:53.886 --> 01:45:01.649]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:03.289]  The Obama Deception.
[01:45:03.709 --> 01:45:04.890]  The people strike back.
[01:45:06.698 --> 01:45:12.023]  With an economy that continues to plummet, many of us will have to make the difficult decision to cut back on our expenses.
[01:45:12.643 --> 01:45:15.325]  One thing we cannot afford to cut back on, though, is our health.
[01:45:15.786 --> 01:45:23.072]  If you suffer from chronic illness, stress, a weak immune system, or just always feel tired, you need to visit Shentrition.com.
[01:45:23.532 --> 01:45:28.056]  The philosophy at Shentrition is to feed the body what it needs, plus heal the body with food.
[01:45:28.812 --> 01:45:29.073]  I think?
[01:45:43.592 --> 01:45:44.833]  Hold on, hold on, here we go.
[01:46:11.062 --> 01:46:12.683]  Okay, I said I'd get to calls.
[01:46:12.703 --> 01:46:13.144]  I didn't.
[01:46:13.204 --> 01:46:14.485]  I took quite a bit though early on.
[01:46:14.525 --> 01:46:15.546]  I'll take calls tomorrow.
[01:46:15.686 --> 01:46:17.168]  I promise when I start the show.
[01:46:18.587 --> 01:46:22.768]  I'm going to cover the new fat tax and all the new carbon taxes.
[01:46:22.848 --> 01:46:24.428]  As we told you, it's all being announced.
[01:46:24.908 --> 01:46:26.768]  Bureaucrats micromanaging every facet.
[01:46:26.788 --> 01:46:31.749]  You think foreigners jabbing you and yelling at old people at airports and going, oh, what this is bad.
[01:46:32.169 --> 01:46:32.809]  Just get ready.
[01:46:32.829 --> 01:46:33.830]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:46:33.850 --> 01:46:36.790]  You're being scientifically bathed in tyranny right now.
[01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:39.071]  But fatties cause global warming.
[01:46:39.111 --> 01:46:39.571]  New tax.
[01:46:39.591 --> 01:46:40.151]  We'll get to that.
[01:46:40.531 --> 01:46:41.551]  I meant to get to this.
[01:46:41.611 --> 01:46:42.311]  This is huge.
[01:46:42.371 --> 01:46:43.651]  Burmese covered it last night.
[01:46:43.951 --> 01:46:44.752]  He'll cover it again tonight.
[01:46:44.772 --> 01:46:46.952]  I'm going to get Paul Watson or Kurt Nemo to do a story on it.
[01:46:48.266 --> 01:47:03.429]  It says foreign troops and everything for a domestic takeover drill, part of a top-off 2009 national-level exercise of terrorism, and FEMA, you know, just working with police, military, foreign troops in America.
[01:47:06.519 --> 01:47:11.261]  Validating the Homeland Security System, that's the federal control grid, over the gun owners, the American people.
[01:47:11.481 --> 01:47:13.202]  They keep saying, it's for foreigners, it's for foreigners.
[01:47:13.482 --> 01:47:15.423]  Prepare to hit the people, prepare to hit them.
[01:47:15.683 --> 01:47:16.263]  Oh, we're your friends.
[01:47:16.663 --> 01:47:20.905]  Oh, give us your rides, let us track and everything to control you, because we want to keep you safe.
[01:47:21.085 --> 01:47:22.385]  These people will soon be under our control.
[01:47:22.405 --> 01:47:23.526]  They're the number one threat to us.
[01:47:23.686 --> 01:47:25.707]  They've got guns, and they know about our banking takeover.
[01:47:25.967 --> 01:47:26.687]  Oh, I'm your friend.
[01:47:26.767 --> 01:47:27.908]  Oh, the government loves you.
[01:47:28.448 --> 01:47:29.608]  I mean, that's what's going on.
[01:47:29.768 --> 01:47:30.729]  Offshore banks run us.
[01:47:32.362 --> 01:47:37.627]  That said, in closing, gentlemen, you're the guys ranting and raving off-air about how bad the checkpoints were.
[01:47:37.647 --> 01:47:41.290]  There was one other point you were gonna make about something, that's why I drug you in here.
[01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:41.490]  Oh!
[01:47:42.130 --> 01:47:44.673]  Aaron was not hurt in the, uh, that was a set-up.
[01:47:44.713 --> 01:47:46.414]  I wasn't really, you know, a foreigner.
[01:47:46.474 --> 01:47:47.975]  I wasn't really slapping him in the face.
[01:47:48.035 --> 01:47:49.176]  I wasn't really interrogating him.
[01:47:49.476 --> 01:47:51.258]  I was just showing you where all this is going.
[01:47:51.798 --> 01:47:53.800]  Yeah, I mean... You woman drink breast milk!
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:54.761]  You know, they, I mean, that's real.
[01:47:55.001 --> 01:47:55.722]  We laugh a little.
[01:47:55.762 --> 01:47:56.582]  Drink it down!
[01:47:56.642 --> 01:47:56.983]  Ha ha!
[01:47:57.023 --> 01:47:57.843]  You'll do what I say!
[01:47:57.863 --> 01:47:58.384]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:47:59.810 --> 01:48:00.593]  I'm getting into character.
[01:48:00.793 --> 01:48:03.963]  I mean, we laugh a little in character, but it really is horrifying.
[01:48:04.124 --> 01:48:06.592]  And it just progressively gets worse and worse.
[01:48:07.142 --> 01:48:08.283]  This is never going away.
[01:48:09.044 --> 01:48:09.884]  It's going to be straight up.
[01:48:09.904 --> 01:48:15.790]  Pretty soon they're going to have a little hot shot, little cattle prods going, you'll bzzz, you'll bzzz.
[01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:20.754]  Last week the guy's patting me down after I've already taken off my shoes and put on my bag.
[01:48:20.774 --> 01:48:22.015]  He's going, oh nice.
[01:48:22.495 --> 01:48:24.637]  I just like to touch people or something.
[01:48:24.657 --> 01:48:27.019]  Oh no, with hot women it's bad, big perverts.
[01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:28.380]  Gentlemen, good job.
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:29.121]  Can I say one thing?
[01:48:30.362 --> 01:48:37.667]  The one thing that the Oath Keepers are saying that these globalists, they don't know how to drive tanks, they don't know how to shoot people, they don't know how to, you know, load a weapon.
[01:48:38.067 --> 01:48:42.390]  They know how to fire, fire foreigners and lobotomize people and give machine guns.
[01:48:42.610 --> 01:48:45.352]  They know how to give orders, but they don't know how to actually carry them out.
[01:48:45.432 --> 01:48:55.638]  So, you know, we still have the power and definitely you should take the oath or reaffirm your oath if you haven't taken it yet to the Constitution because that's the only... That is a conspiracy theory.
[01:48:55.658 --> 01:48:57.399]  This is not a nation run by the people.
[01:48:57.439 --> 01:48:58.200]  There is no liberty.
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:48:59.501]  That's an Al-Qaeda lie.
[01:49:00.137 --> 01:49:03.879]  Most foreigners working in TSA better learn about the Constitution or we're all in trouble.
[01:49:03.919 --> 01:49:08.081]  They've been hired because they'll carry out tyranny, because they come from nations of tyranny.
[01:49:08.701 --> 01:49:10.482]  Or they just line folks up and machine gun them.
[01:49:10.882 --> 01:49:12.243]  Hey, good job men, thanks for coming in.
[01:49:12.623 --> 01:49:15.144]  They're converting the entire military over to foreigners right now.
[01:49:15.164 --> 01:49:18.466]  Alright, Retransmission, huge show, covered a lot in the first hour.
[01:49:19.046 --> 01:49:22.248]  I want to tell you about a few sponsors here at the very, very end before we go into Retransmission.

[01:49:39.672 --> 01:49:47.196]  You get an emergency power backup kit, which consists of the PowerSource 1800 power plant and high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[01:49:48.277 --> 01:49:51.359]  The solar generator is like having your own silent power plant hidden in your home.
[01:49:52.335 --> 01:49:55.656]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move today.
[01:49:55.716 --> 01:49:57.597]  It's the perfect energy backup for triple times.

[01:50:30.461 --> 01:50:33.362]  They've got it down to a super small nano-sized particle.

[01:50:57.008 --> 01:50:58.569]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:58.689 --> 01:51:03.292]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:51:03.432 --> 01:51:06.173]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:51:06.394 --> 01:51:09.235]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:51:09.435 --> 01:51:15.319]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:51:15.519 --> 01:51:18.461]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:18.741 --> 01:51:25.645]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
