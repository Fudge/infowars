[00:00:07.393 --> 00:00:10.658]  I love you folks.
[00:00:10.758 --> 00:00:11.480]  I love all of you.
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.822]  And thanks for putting up with me.
[00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:13.423]  I am in a bit of a...
[00:00:15.094 --> 00:00:37.028]  I'm in an angry mood today because watching my country die, watching it being overrun by crooks, watching them on the verge of passing taxes on toilet paper, bottled drinks, beef, chicken, pork, roads, all plastics, factories, to know that it's unlimited power for all these agencies to just come in and shut down whatever they want.
[00:00:37.048 --> 00:00:38.709]  It makes me mad!
[00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.530]  You really want to get down to it.
[00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.832]  I try to just get angry and hate these people, but at the
[00:00:44.932 --> 00:00:46.713]  At the core of it, I'm just sick of it!
[00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:51.236]  It's so ridiculous that the evil has to keep winning!
[00:00:51.277 --> 00:00:52.237]  I'm tired of it!
[00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.143]  We just went live at PrisonPlanet.tv, what, an hour and fifty minutes into the radio show.
[00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:02.665]  We're here live every day, 11 a.m.
[00:01:02.685 --> 00:01:03.345]  to 3 p.m.
[00:01:05.427 --> 00:01:06.507]  Central Standard Time.
[00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:10.030]  Coming up, I've got a bunch of video clips I want to play.
[00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.213]  I've got Walter Cronkite at a World Federalist Society calling for world government.
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:30.024]  We have Hillary Clinton last week at the Council on Foreign Relations saying that the CFR tells the White House what to do, which is a fact, but now these bastards are openly... They've gone from saying the CFR didn't exist 10-12 years ago to saying it exists and they run things.
[00:01:31.184 --> 00:01:33.765]  I mean, again, they're dominating us.
[00:01:34.245 --> 00:01:36.266]  They're just showing us everything.
[00:01:38.487 --> 00:01:39.927]  And I have a CNBC clip
[00:01:41.092 --> 00:01:49.040]  Because the last time, three months ago, the last number was $14.8 trillion they'd stolen in seven months.
[00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:55.586]  Now, nine months into the banker takeover from last October, $24 trillion!
[00:01:55.986 --> 00:01:58.348]  Trillion!
[00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:00.791]  The sky's the limit, folks!
[00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:02.252]  We gotta pay for all this!
[00:02:02.472 --> 00:02:03.353]  We're the interest!
[00:02:05.895 --> 00:02:06.096]  I mean,
[00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:07.915]  It's over!
[00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:08.656]  We're screwed!
[00:02:08.956 --> 00:02:15.978]  Either we say we're not paying it, it's fraud, you all go to jail, bankers, or they rule us with carbon police!
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.460]  And it's on the news!
[00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:23.081]  They've got carbon police.
[00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:24.382]  It's on the news!
[00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:26.022]  They're saying it's good!
[00:02:29.363 --> 00:02:31.364]  I mean, I am just going crazy, folks.
[00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:33.125]  This is so insane.
[00:02:36.584 --> 00:02:37.905]  And by the way, we're not the bankers.
[00:02:37.965 --> 00:02:42.908]  We're not the New World Order to get to tax you and then use our own money against us.
[00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.672]  So at the closing of this hour, we'll come right back and get into all the video clips and your calls.
[00:02:49.593 --> 00:02:51.374]  I want to tell folks about Fabled Enemies.
[00:02:53.776 --> 00:02:57.638]  Jason Burmas' hard-hitting 9-11 film exposing how the globalists carried out the attacks.
[00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.020]  The latest information, the most up-to-date.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.561]  Want to get Fabled Enemies at InfoWars.com.
[00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:09.399]  Endgame blueprint for global enslavement to understand what makes the new world order tick, what their master plan is.
[00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.715]  A new documentary presentation with added footage nobody had ever seen of that last interview Aaron Russo did before he died with me.
[00:03:17.315 --> 00:03:19.117]  Reflections and Warnings interview with Aaron Russo.
[00:03:19.337 --> 00:03:24.742]  We've got a deal on InfoWars.com where you can get this for free when you get it with the Obama deception.
[00:03:24.762 --> 00:03:26.143]  I just want to get these out to people.
[00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:30.367]  Folks have requested that we put this on a DVD in higher quality.
[00:03:30.427 --> 00:03:33.349]  It's got a presentation for myself, the latest banking info.
[00:03:34.466 --> 00:03:38.247]  And a bunch of other clips and documents, reflections and warnings, very important.
[00:03:38.688 --> 00:03:48.291]  Global warming, emerging science and understanding, Dr. Michael Kaufman's latest film on the whole green tax scam, and of course the Obama deception.
[00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:57.294]  I watched this film again with friends I was staying with in Los Angeles while I was doing some work, and they were just completely blown away by it.
[00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:01.656]  And I really, watching my own film in hindsight, five months after it came out,
[00:04:02.782 --> 00:04:04.843]  This sucker is powerful and needs to be seen.
[00:04:04.863 --> 00:04:06.363]  InfoWars.com.
[00:04:06.523 --> 00:04:10.765]  Have these DVDs on your books shelf, on your video shelf.
[00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:13.225]  And also, your purchase supports this radio show.
[00:04:13.245 --> 00:04:17.347]  I want to thank all of you that have gotten the books and videos available at InfoWars.com.
[00:04:17.387 --> 00:04:19.227]  You can also call toll-free.
[00:04:19.608 --> 00:04:20.608]  Operators are standing by.
[00:04:20.628 --> 00:04:20.748]  888-253-3139.
[00:04:20.768 --> 00:04:20.808]  888-253-3139.
[00:04:20.828 --> 00:04:21.728]  Alright, third hour.
[00:04:21.748 --> 00:04:22.288]  Stay with us.
[00:04:33.638 --> 00:04:35.239]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.502]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:04:41.024 --> 00:04:42.125]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:04:42.405 --> 00:04:44.187]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:04:44.407 --> 00:04:45.008]  Well, you should.
[00:04:45.028 --> 00:04:49.632]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:50.372]  That's right.
[00:04:50.672 --> 00:05:00.601]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:01.842]  Plus, if you act fast,
[00:05:02.042 --> 00:05:07.664]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:05:08.025 --> 00:05:14.527]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:05:14.908 --> 00:05:20.090]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.591]  This is real.
[00:05:21.891 --> 00:05:22.631]  Don't miss out.
[00:05:22.932 --> 00:05:31.317]  Secure a Front Sight Defensive Handgun Course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.

[00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:37.381]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:40.543]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[00:05:44.265 --> 00:05:46.187]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:05:46.667 --> 00:05:49.449]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:05:56.067 --> 00:05:58.329]  It's Tuesday, the 21st day of July 2009.
[00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:02.992]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:06:25.808 --> 00:06:27.649]  And I know I said we'd have a lot of phones today.
[00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:28.810]  We have been taking your calls.
[00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.891]  In fact, let's go ahead and take a few calls.
[00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:37.174]  In the next segment, I'm going to play these video clips dealing with 24 trillion dollars stolen by the offshore banks.
[00:06:38.234 --> 00:06:45.197]  A story that dovetailed with a caller earlier about Army Awards 24 million satellite terminal contract to L3.
[00:06:45.257 --> 00:06:47.218]  The U.S.
[00:06:47.258 --> 00:06:50.200]  Army began buying new ground terminals to expand battlefield.
[00:06:51.497 --> 00:06:57.399]  Access to commercial satellite communications bandwidth under a $24 million contract ordered April 15th.
[00:06:57.799 --> 00:07:05.261]  So that dovetails in with the Humvees and things zooming around running checkpoints.
[00:07:05.801 --> 00:07:08.582]  So we'll go over that report as well.
[00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:12.200]  Coming up, another report here.
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.101]  Powerful ideas, military developing, cyber bug spies.
[00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:27.426]  I remember two years ago it was in the Washington Post about fake dragonflies about four inches across, five inches long, flying around videotaping demonstrators.
[00:07:29.667 --> 00:07:32.428]  Yeah, this is now going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:44.186]  I was at a friend's house this weekend, and we were working on a report, and this lizard outside comes running up to us, and my buddy probably got a camera in it.
[00:07:44.206 --> 00:07:52.351]  He was joking, but we've now gotten to that point where you have to sit there and joke about such things.
[00:07:53.832 --> 00:07:56.213]  So that's all coming up.
[00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.673]  Also, Bohemian Grove's been going for about a week and a half now, so we've got some new news on that as well.
[00:08:03.134 --> 00:08:05.095]  That's coming up, but right now, let's go back to your calls.
[00:08:05.395 --> 00:08:07.177]  Let's talk to John in Louisiana.
[00:08:07.217 --> 00:08:08.037]  John, thanks for holding.
[00:08:08.758 --> 00:08:09.518]  Top of the morning to you.
[00:08:09.558 --> 00:08:11.760]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:19.265]  I want to thank you and Jason for all of the work you have done, and I actually have some good news for you.
[00:08:21.006 --> 00:08:22.487]  Oh, well, hell, let me have it.
[00:08:22.527 --> 00:08:22.988]  I want to hear it.
[00:08:24.608 --> 00:08:37.038]  And, uh, the mid-level minions of the New World Order decided they wanted to sell their eugenics plan, you know, their eugenics healthcare, to the people in Louisiana.
[00:08:37.999 --> 00:08:42.462]  Well, they didn't advertise it at all, because they wanted very little opposition.
[00:08:43.123 --> 00:08:47.106]  And media from all the, you know, mainstream local outlets were there.
[00:08:48.046 --> 00:08:52.590]  But, we actually managed to get a really good question in, despite
[00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:56.260]  All of the other questions that they had.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:15.345]  Kathleen Phyllibus, the head of the Health and Human Services Department with the Bilderberg, was reported in the Kansas Daily in 2007, and she's on the list for 2008, and we asked her that question.
[00:09:16.466 --> 00:09:20.707]  So what did you ask her about the wondrous new federal health care they're going to give you?
[00:09:23.482 --> 00:09:25.303]  Well, I couldn't get a question in.
[00:09:25.403 --> 00:09:30.025]  I was videotaping it on my camera phone.
[00:09:30.325 --> 00:09:34.967]  I actually have the video uploaded on the computer already on YouTube.
[00:09:35.447 --> 00:09:36.107]  Good!
[00:09:37.208 --> 00:09:39.148]  And we went under Campaign for Liberty.
[00:09:39.168 --> 00:09:41.589]  We started handing out constitutions in the audience.
[00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.490]  I know.
[00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:44.491]  Dangerous stuff.
[00:09:44.571 --> 00:09:46.091]  I'm handing out constitutions.
[00:09:46.191 --> 00:09:50.193]  And Obama... Did this freak them out?
[00:09:50.213 --> 00:09:52.294]  Did they think Al Qaeda was hitting and hitting hard?
[00:09:54.281 --> 00:10:04.144]  Yes they did, but it was actually really surprising because some of the cops came up to us and shook our hands after we mentioned Voderberg.
[00:10:04.364 --> 00:10:08.826]  It seemed like some people in the crowd knew who we were asking.
[00:10:08.906 --> 00:10:09.806]  I even heard gasps.
[00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:12.127]  I heard a lot of clapping.
[00:10:12.147 --> 00:10:13.987]  Oh my god, they're mentioning our rulers!
[00:10:14.427 --> 00:10:15.168]  Oh, don't!
[00:10:16.308 --> 00:10:17.188]  The officers!
[00:10:17.608 --> 00:10:18.089]  The officers!
[00:10:18.169 --> 00:10:18.709]  Arrest them!
[00:10:18.749 --> 00:10:20.329]  The officers are like, no, we're not going to.
[00:10:20.349 --> 00:10:21.550]  How dare you!
[00:10:24.735 --> 00:10:25.756]  I want to hear more about this.
[00:10:25.776 --> 00:10:26.936]  You say this video's up.
[00:10:26.956 --> 00:10:27.356]  Stay there.
[00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:29.778]  I want to hear more about this from our caller.
[00:10:31.018 --> 00:10:31.799]  John, Louisiana.
[00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:34.280]  And I'll talk to Mark, Chad, David, Joshua, and others.
[00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:36.781]  It's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:37.682 --> 00:10:40.503]  Right here on the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[00:10:40.543 --> 00:10:41.704]  Hey, sorry, Limbaugh.
[00:10:42.124 --> 00:10:44.245]  All those years you said the Bilderberg didn't exist.
[00:10:44.445 --> 00:10:45.286]  The CFR didn't.
[00:10:46.226 --> 00:10:47.007]  You're discredited.
[00:10:47.027 --> 00:10:49.308]  You were unable to suppress conservative America.
[00:10:49.328 --> 00:10:50.509]  They now know the truth.
[00:10:51.394 --> 00:10:52.915]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:10:53.075 --> 00:10:57.716]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:10:57.816 --> 00:11:00.557]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:11:00.757 --> 00:11:03.638]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:11:03.798 --> 00:11:08.520]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.700]  If you simply prepare.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.842]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you.
[00:11:13.122 --> 00:11:20.025]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:11:20.125 --> 00:11:23.246]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:11:23.386 --> 00:11:23.666]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:11:26.067 --> 00:11:28.309]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:34.636]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-stride, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:11:34.816 --> 00:11:38.560]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.302]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:11:40.322 --> 00:11:40.822]  Take action today.
[00:11:41.123 --> 00:11:42.384]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:56.663]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[00:11:56.963 --> 00:11:58.124]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:11:58.264 --> 00:12:02.225]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called InnerFood.
[00:12:02.545 --> 00:12:04.106]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[00:12:04.406 --> 00:12:10.689]  And now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[00:12:11.849 --> 00:12:14.390]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:16.191]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[00:12:16.452 --> 00:12:19.233]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[00:12:19.473 --> 00:12:20.914]  And their formula really works.

[00:12:25.476 --> 00:12:29.879]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boost the immune system.
[00:12:30.259 --> 00:12:32.460]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.941]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:36.882]  Don't forget to try their other great products.

[00:12:50.986 --> 00:12:55.007]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:12:55.227 --> 00:12:57.027]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:12:57.247 --> 00:13:05.489]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:13:05.749 --> 00:13:10.975]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:13:11.296 --> 00:13:12.918]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:13:13.178 --> 00:13:19.505]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:13:19.685 --> 00:13:24.191]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere.
[00:13:24.451 --> 00:13:24.871]  We're good to go.
[00:13:52.995 --> 00:13:58.999]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:13:59.619 --> 00:14:02.661]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:14:06.703 --> 00:14:08.504]  I've got a report here out of England.
[00:14:09.745 --> 00:14:12.927]  Facebook police raided my family barbecue.
[00:14:15.285 --> 00:14:20.366]  The guy said I'm having a birthday party for my 30th family barbecue.
[00:14:20.786 --> 00:14:22.127]  No music, hamburgers.
[00:14:22.587 --> 00:14:26.868]  The police raided them with helicopters and police and said it's not allowed.
[00:14:26.888 --> 00:14:29.328]  You have to have a permit to have a party basically anywhere.
[00:14:30.028 --> 00:14:32.189]  And the police are here in the newspaper defending themselves.
[00:14:32.749 --> 00:14:36.750]  See, you're gonna ask permission to pee in the toilet, folks.
[00:14:38.564 --> 00:14:46.635]  And the feds are now talking about making it law to have sensors in all toilets to test for drugs automatically that are hooked to a wireless internet system.
[00:14:47.256 --> 00:14:48.899]  And they already have old folks homes that do this.
[00:14:49.139 --> 00:14:50.240]  Everything is going to be tracked.
[00:14:50.601 --> 00:14:53.906]  The nanny state, they're going to watch you, they're going to boss you, they're going to control you.
[00:14:55.350 --> 00:15:15.792]  But the last caller we're about to go back to was talking about, he was at an event with the Health and Human Services Secretary, who is a Bilderberg Group member, exposing how the feds want to federalize everything and that the police and they were handing out pod constitutions at the Obama event and talking about the Bilderberg Group were coming up and shaking their hand because the police are waking up.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.020]  There's three things.
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:23.641]  Either cops are good men and women, they wake up and realize what's happening, because they're right in the middle of it.
[00:15:24.401 --> 00:15:28.562]  Or they're really stupid and don't understand what they're part of and kind of go along with it.
[00:15:29.042 --> 00:15:31.002]  Or they're evil and know what they're part of.
[00:15:32.443 --> 00:15:32.963]  But that's it.
[00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:34.363]  Those three groups.
[00:15:35.683 --> 00:15:42.304]  And it's our job to reach out to the ignorant ones, the ones that are kind of under a spell or in a trance, so they can see what's happening.
[00:15:42.344 --> 00:15:46.185]  But finish up John and Louisiana with the story you were telling.
[00:15:48.123 --> 00:15:54.826]  Well, before I went to the event, I did my research on all the people that were there.
[00:15:54.927 --> 00:16:07.573]  We had Tom Bilczak, the Department of Agriculture was there, the Department of Veteran Affairs, Eric Shinsky, Shinseki, U.S.
[00:16:07.593 --> 00:16:14.437]  Department of Labor, Hilda Solis, and all these people.
[00:16:15.377 --> 00:16:17.078]  Hilda is a CFR member.
[00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:35.918]  Shinsky is a CFR member, and Department of Agriculture Tom Bilsack, the former Iowa governor, gave two rewards to Monsanto, which I'm sure you're aware of Monsanto.
[00:16:36.578 --> 00:16:37.879]  Yes, Monsanto, yes.
[00:16:41.441 --> 00:16:46.143]  But I did my research, but she was answering most of the questions.
[00:16:47.939 --> 00:16:52.101]  Now, this meeting, she was there pushing the President's health care takeover plan?
[00:16:53.062 --> 00:16:53.242]  Yes.
[00:16:54.582 --> 00:16:59.965]  Okay, but you say that when you mentioned Bilderberg, or one of your group did, that there were gasps in the audience.
[00:17:00.846 --> 00:17:02.446]  Yes, there were gasps in the audience.
[00:17:02.486 --> 00:17:10.490]  I even heard some boos when she mentioned it's an international group of European and American business.
[00:17:12.301 --> 00:17:17.783]  political officials that... Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, sir, just tell the story in a nutshell.
[00:17:18.223 --> 00:17:21.504]  You mean she got confronted about Bilderberg and talked about it?
[00:17:22.624 --> 00:17:23.645]  Yes, briefly.
[00:17:24.145 --> 00:17:26.066]  She briefly explained what Bilderberg was.
[00:17:26.706 --> 00:17:27.666]  And the people booed her?
[00:17:27.706 --> 00:17:34.268]  She said she did attend and that Governor Rick Perry, she didn't say that whether he attended, but she said that he was invited.
[00:17:34.749 --> 00:17:41.131]  But she said at the end of it, it wasn't very that clear, but if you listen in really well,
[00:17:42.751 --> 00:17:43.091]  I do.
[00:17:43.171 --> 00:17:45.073]  Okay, appreciate your call.
[00:17:45.133 --> 00:17:46.133]  Keep up the good work there.
[00:17:46.193 --> 00:17:46.954]  Good to hear from you.
[00:17:50.316 --> 00:17:52.337]  Let's go ahead and take another call now.
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:01.223]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Oregon.
[00:18:01.283 --> 00:18:02.064]  Mark, you're on the air.
[00:18:02.644 --> 00:18:03.245]  Hello, Alex.
[00:18:03.805 --> 00:18:04.366]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:18:04.986 --> 00:18:06.427]  Yeah, great to have you back.
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:21.673]  Alex, you mentioned on a recent show that you'll soon become active in the formation of organizations and groups and that you would be moving away from the video informational realm into the organizational realm.
[00:18:23.535 --> 00:18:29.561]  Could you, would you give some specifics about what you plan to do in this new venture and what you envision for it?
[00:18:31.383 --> 00:18:38.783]  Well, I was saying that I've thought about not focusing so much on films and more on creating organizations.
[00:18:40.154 --> 00:18:42.536]  But then you need a film for the organizations to give out.
[00:18:42.556 --> 00:18:51.503]  I mean, to go out and actively fight the eugenicist, and to go out and tell people it's not the law, you don't have to take vaccines, and to really get aggressive.
[00:18:51.963 --> 00:18:57.647]  The only problem is then I wouldn't have the funds to fund organizations or even the setting up of them.
[00:18:58.288 --> 00:19:02.751]  And then they launch COINTELPRO against your organization if you try to create some tax-free thing.
[00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:08.855]  Then they have their operatives come in and say, oh, you're spending the money on something you shouldn't, you know, even if it's for legal defense.
[00:19:10.057 --> 00:19:16.000]  We really have a child-like, not serious population, almost designed to sabotage themselves.
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:24.723]  But I kind of put that idea out there for other people to start organizations and other people to go out and warn folks about eugenics.
[00:19:25.183 --> 00:19:30.866]  What I'm saying is, last week as I realized more and more, kind of brainstorming on air, that eugenics is everything.
[00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:36.153]  That that mindset and that system and that that's what the planetary government is.
[00:19:36.193 --> 00:19:37.394]  That's what it's set up to do.
[00:19:38.154 --> 00:19:45.800]  And here it is verified in the textbook written by the White House science czar, saying that.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.361]  I mean, it's real.
[00:19:48.742 --> 00:19:51.524]  And that's the big issue.
[00:19:52.364 --> 00:19:54.946]  And I need to do everything I can to reach out to people on that subject.
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:07.363]  You know, mainly it's a frustration because there's so much going on, there's so much happening, and I just want to beat these people.
[00:20:07.463 --> 00:20:16.787]  I mean, it's so obvious what they're doing, it's so evil, it's so out of the open, it's so ridiculously classically tyrannical and corrupt and bad.
[00:20:16.807 --> 00:20:17.887]  I appreciate your call, Mark.
[00:20:19.207 --> 00:20:20.908]  There isn't any idea formed on that.
[00:20:21.248 --> 00:20:23.149]  I mean, I can barely get my cameras to work in here.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.821]  You know, I'm very frustrated.
[00:20:25.861 --> 00:20:35.006]  I spend most of my time messing with taxes, and employees, and light bulbs, and carrying the trash out, and the same crap everybody else does, or broken water heaters.
[00:20:36.226 --> 00:20:39.028]  And then I'm the biggest best there is, and that isn't very good.
[00:20:39.048 --> 00:20:42.190]  At the end of the day, I'm not that good.
[00:20:44.251 --> 00:20:48.713]  And the globalists are organized, they're corrupt, they're a bunch of thieving parasites.
[00:20:49.153 --> 00:20:50.474]  They use our money against us.
[00:20:56.534 --> 00:20:57.635]  People are waking up though.
[00:20:58.115 --> 00:21:00.858]  A lot of good things are happening and so I should be more positive.
[00:21:00.998 --> 00:21:09.625]  I just have trouble looking at Obama and trouble looking at Bush and looking at all these local criminals and looking at all the stuff they do.
[00:21:09.786 --> 00:21:10.766]  I'm sick of them!
[00:21:11.627 --> 00:21:13.329]  I have more than a hatred for them.
[00:21:13.369 --> 00:21:15.571]  I have a disgust, a disdain, a
[00:21:21.058 --> 00:21:27.083]  Tectonic, tightness, explosive, anathema.
[00:21:27.503 --> 00:21:28.464]  They are anathema.
[00:21:28.624 --> 00:21:30.726]  It's not even that I hate them or are disgusted.
[00:21:30.826 --> 00:21:32.207]  I want to be away from them.
[00:21:32.387 --> 00:21:33.588]  I don't like them.
[00:21:33.929 --> 00:21:35.430]  I don't like looking at them.
[00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:36.771]  I don't like hearing them.
[00:21:36.791 --> 00:21:40.214]  I don't like all their tics and all their enjoyment of petty power.
[00:21:40.494 --> 00:21:42.055]  I hate their worldliness.
[00:21:42.395 --> 00:21:43.476]  I hate their pettiness.
[00:21:43.777 --> 00:21:48.600]  I hate the fact that they don't enjoy beauty or decency or honor or
[00:21:57.475 --> 00:22:03.470]  See, I start thinking about them and just the image of them starts going into my mind and that's something I can't allow.
[00:22:05.709 --> 00:22:18.374]  I know these people, I know what makes them tick, I've looked into their minds, I've studied them, I know who they are, and I just can't believe we are this low to let this type of worthless trash run things.
[00:22:18.435 --> 00:22:27.638]  This type of innocence-destroying, decency-destroying, ugh, it hurts my soul, folks.
[00:22:29.259 --> 00:22:33.241]  And my spirit just rises up against them to just a level
[00:22:37.654 --> 00:22:39.055]  I just want to get my hands around their throats.
[00:22:40.755 --> 00:22:41.916]  You want to get down to the bottom line.
[00:22:45.737 --> 00:22:46.717]  And you know they feel the same.
[00:22:46.757 --> 00:22:47.578]  They don't like us.
[00:22:48.678 --> 00:22:50.459]  They want to get their hands around our throats too.
[00:22:50.719 --> 00:22:51.279]  And they are.
[00:22:51.619 --> 00:22:53.920]  Every day you drink that damn tap water.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.361]  Every day you shoot your kids up and eat the GMO food.
[00:22:57.381 --> 00:23:03.523]  And they're just going to go on hurting us and killing us and screwing us and lying to us.
[00:23:03.903 --> 00:23:04.904]  And I'm sick of it!
[00:23:06.587 --> 00:23:12.312]  And they take our normal instincts of manhood and valor and honor and they twist it and use it for their own aims.
[00:23:13.773 --> 00:23:15.654]  They got the best of us working for them.
[00:23:15.674 --> 00:23:17.095]  It's a load of crap!
[00:23:19.597 --> 00:23:20.658]  Let's take another call.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.723]  I just swear on the altar of God that we're going to beat you.
[00:23:27.704 --> 00:23:30.786]  I swear I'm going to do whatever it takes to beat you!
[00:23:32.528 --> 00:23:34.930]  And the people out there are making that oath as well.
[00:23:39.847 --> 00:23:41.008]  Chad in Florida, go ahead.
[00:23:42.249 --> 00:23:45.011]  Oh man, it is so nice to listen to you.
[00:23:46.032 --> 00:23:47.893]  It's good to hear from you.
[00:23:47.913 --> 00:23:48.554]  What's on your mind?
[00:23:49.374 --> 00:23:52.136]  I feel the exact same way you do every single day.
[00:23:52.176 --> 00:24:02.004]  It is disgusting on a daily basis to wake up surrounded with these grown, immature kids playing with technology and toys.
[00:24:03.105 --> 00:24:07.408]  It's disgusting the way things have been engineered over the past hundred years in this country.
[00:24:08.228 --> 00:24:10.730]  It makes me sick to look at these people every time.
[00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.572]  Same with you, Brock is on TV.
[00:24:14.493 --> 00:24:16.094]  They have sucked our soul out!
[00:24:16.975 --> 00:24:17.435]  They have.
[00:24:17.515 --> 00:24:22.879]  They've engineered this country to be the forefront in how not to live every day.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.480]  And what not to do.
[00:24:25.001 --> 00:24:29.044]  And they've set it all up to where everything is just the way it is nowadays.
[00:24:29.104 --> 00:24:32.987]  People have a hard time backtracking and backengineering the truth nowadays.
[00:24:33.747 --> 00:24:34.828]  It's sick!
[00:24:35.649 --> 00:24:37.010]  And I was wondering, like,
[00:24:37.771 --> 00:24:42.252]  What exactly is it going to take for everyone involved in all this?
[00:24:43.192 --> 00:24:43.753]  Two things.
[00:24:44.273 --> 00:24:45.313]  To pay for everything.
[00:24:45.753 --> 00:24:52.615]  To pay for the way it's been, the way it was set up, for all the millions of people that died and suffered for nothing in their lives.
[00:24:53.355 --> 00:24:55.536]  And also at the same time, for it to change.
[00:24:56.556 --> 00:25:01.837]  You know, everybody can be informed all they want, but I think these people are going to battle us until the very end.
[00:25:02.538 --> 00:25:04.058]  And it's not going to be a happy
[00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:07.191]  Revolution or some fearful pheromone.
[00:25:07.211 --> 00:25:07.832]  No, exactly!
[00:25:08.192 --> 00:25:13.075]  They are on point, they are vicious, they are wicked, they love stench and death and hurting goodness.
[00:25:13.095 --> 00:25:13.835]  I mean, they really do.
[00:25:14.335 --> 00:25:15.236]  They really are evil.
[00:25:15.276 --> 00:25:20.198]  When you talk to globalists, and I've been around them, they just go... I mean, they just enjoy it.
[00:25:20.218 --> 00:25:21.899]  They're like grinding on a nerve.
[00:25:21.959 --> 00:25:26.222]  It's like a... It's like a just... Oh, they're sick.
[00:25:26.562 --> 00:25:28.443]  It's just... And they're not going to give us a quarter.
[00:25:29.884 --> 00:25:30.544]  Anything else, sir?
[00:25:30.564 --> 00:25:31.425]  You're making some good points.
[00:25:31.485 --> 00:25:31.865]  Anything else?
[00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:39.852]  Uh, I just, I mean, if you can talk about what's it gonna take for all this to change and stay changed and get these people out of power, that's my concern.
[00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:41.973]  I'll tell you what, I'll talk about that when we get back.
[00:25:41.993 --> 00:25:47.015]  Stay there, I'm gonna get your comment on my points and then we're gonna, at the bottom of the hour, we'll play these video clips coming up.
[00:25:47.035 --> 00:25:51.056]  Looks like they've taken the Hillary video down that I saw with her saying she works for the CFR.
[00:25:51.721 --> 00:25:58.568]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[00:25:58.868 --> 00:26:14.763]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[00:26:15.063 --> 00:26:20.207]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[00:26:20.427 --> 00:26:26.712]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[00:26:26.952 --> 00:26:30.595]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[00:26:30.835 --> 00:26:33.437]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[00:26:33.537 --> 00:26:38.901]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[00:26:39.201 --> 00:26:41.822]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:26:41.882 --> 00:26:44.084]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[00:26:44.104 --> 00:26:46.565]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:26:46.605 --> 00:26:50.947]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[00:26:52.468 --> 00:26:56.190]  Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources and let me ask just one question.
[00:26:56.971 --> 00:27:00.033]  What would you list as the things that the federal government does really well?
[00:27:00.694 --> 00:27:03.036]  The armed forces and printing bogus money doesn't count.
[00:27:03.576 --> 00:27:09.560]  Now take that blank page of yours and list the ways that you have to protect your assets and escape the paper markets.
[00:27:10.161 --> 00:27:11.982]  The only real option is precious metals.
[00:27:12.523 --> 00:27:18.267]  For your retirement, your kid's education, or just plain survival when the whole Obama mess comes crashing down.
[00:27:19.188 --> 00:27:21.810]  You are the only one you can count on for a stimulus package.
[00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:26.233]  And I'd like to discuss a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your family.
[00:27:26.795 --> 00:27:30.999]  Please give me a call at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:27:31.239 --> 00:27:35.784]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:27:36.845 --> 00:27:40.128]  And together we can develop a Make Sense program before the clock runs out.
[00:27:40.749 --> 00:27:42.490]  Once more, John Swenson at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.072]  And take charge of your future and thank you.
[00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:57.517]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:27:58.237 --> 00:28:03.584]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:28:04.124 --> 00:28:10.292]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:28:10.532 --> 00:28:12.433]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:28:12.573 --> 00:28:14.975]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:28:15.055 --> 00:28:25.981]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:28:28.222 --> 00:28:29.523]  It's not about left or right.
[00:28:29.903 --> 00:28:31.304]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:28:31.764 --> 00:28:37.988]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:28:38.661 --> 00:28:46.424]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:28:46.924 --> 00:28:48.044]  The Obama Deception.
[00:28:48.504 --> 00:28:49.765]  The people strike back.
[00:28:51.545 --> 00:28:58.047]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes.com, the makers of the highest quality vault doors and safes available.

[00:29:59.107 --> 00:30:13.316]  To answer Chad in Florida's question... How do we wake people up?
[00:30:13.356 --> 00:30:15.937]  How do we get them involved?
[00:30:17.078 --> 00:30:18.199]  How do we get them to see the light?
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.622]  Our culture has degenerated very slowly.
[00:30:24.915 --> 00:30:27.697]  And it's all been adopted as habits.
[00:30:28.318 --> 00:30:35.423]  And the globalists take a lot of evil things and bad things, we do naturally, and they accentuate them.
[00:30:36.284 --> 00:30:37.665]  They legitimize them.
[00:30:38.646 --> 00:30:42.749]  They say it's honorable not to care about your neighbor, honorable to not be involved.
[00:30:48.133 --> 00:30:51.256]  And it's going to take people breaking out of the control mode.
[00:30:52.659 --> 00:30:57.883]  It's going to take individuals realizing they're not fulfilled because they're not living right.
[00:30:58.904 --> 00:30:59.925]  And they're not informed.
[00:31:00.706 --> 00:31:05.650]  And their subconscious mind knows they're being scammed and lied to and that bad things are going on.
[00:31:07.371 --> 00:31:16.058]  And they're not going to get fulfillment diving deeper into denial.
[00:31:16.619 --> 00:31:18.440]  Deeper into the sick culture.
[00:31:19.421 --> 00:31:20.482]  Yet they're only going to get
[00:31:21.946 --> 00:31:31.090]  Fulfillment by finding out the truth and standing up for what's good and pure and honest and wholesome.
[00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:33.791]  And the globalists know that.
[00:31:33.851 --> 00:31:41.614]  They know we're having a cultural crisis worldwide in this controlled high-tech society and all the changes that are happening.
[00:31:43.499 --> 00:31:50.522]  And so, they come out and say, oh, we need to have a green revolution to fix all this and a new way of life and simplicity.
[00:31:50.962 --> 00:31:55.885]  And they say a lot of things that are true, but then piggyback on that all of their tyranny and control.
[00:31:57.525 --> 00:32:05.489]  So, they have a lot of the best and brightest and good people working with them, believing they're doing it for the greater good.
[00:32:05.529 --> 00:32:10.251]  It's psychology, it's sociology, it's anthropology.
[00:32:10.791 --> 00:32:12.192]  The establishment knows what they're doing.
[00:32:13.464 --> 00:32:21.092]  So it takes people kind of breaking out of the status quo, the comfort zone they're in, and seeing the bigger picture.
[00:32:23.595 --> 00:32:36.008]  And because the globalists are making their move from a somewhat controlled society to a totally controlled, feudal, neo-serf society, people are getting uncomfortable now.
[00:32:37.346 --> 00:32:39.728]  And they're starting to stand up and say no.
[00:32:40.148 --> 00:32:52.737]  But the globalists foresaw all of that decades ago and have been setting up a giant archipelago of prisons and police and surveillance and military and citizen surveillance squads.
[00:32:53.938 --> 00:32:58.561]  And as they implode the economy, there's only going to be jobs serving the system.
[00:33:01.063 --> 00:33:04.245]  Even if you work for a corporation, it's going to be servicing a government contract.
[00:33:06.587 --> 00:33:12.489]  So our society is converting to a planned, organized, highly controlled tyranny.
[00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:18.250]  And so, take the issue of eugenics.
[00:33:20.491 --> 00:33:32.715]  I get up here on air and I read from all these textbooks and government documents how they want to poison the water in the air and how they want to sterilize us, which they are doing, and how they want to break up the families and have CPS, you know, in the nuclear family.
[00:33:32.755 --> 00:33:33.935]  This is stated policy.
[00:33:37.785 --> 00:33:42.007]  In scores of government management level manuals.
[00:33:43.328 --> 00:33:44.048]  And we're here now.
[00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:51.492]  And I tell you folks, this is, for all of human society, this has been recognized as despotism.
[00:33:52.772 --> 00:33:53.433]  As the tyrant.
[00:33:54.853 --> 00:34:03.838]  And they may try to package it up in 21st century bows and paper and bells and whistles, but it's bad.
[00:34:06.058 --> 00:34:08.779]  And so it's going to take a lot of people getting hurt by the system.
[00:34:09.879 --> 00:34:18.242]  But if we don't speak out and point out what this really is, then as the system gets more abusive, people won't even be able to recognize that.
[00:34:18.662 --> 00:34:21.583]  They'll get caught up in the moment and not see the big picture.
[00:34:22.043 --> 00:34:27.745]  Our job is just to get folks to pull back, see the big picture, not get so caught in the everyday
[00:34:29.088 --> 00:34:39.872]  Grind the everyday groove of doing the same thing the same way that they let life pass them by without ever thinking, what makes human societies operate?
[00:34:39.932 --> 00:34:42.373]  What makes me want the things I want?
[00:34:42.453 --> 00:34:44.073]  What makes me do the things I do?
[00:34:48.475 --> 00:34:53.217]  So it's gonna take, really all I am is like a cold bucket of water on somebody to wake them up.
[00:34:54.877 --> 00:34:57.058]  And I'm ham-fisted half the time, I'm not perfect.
[00:34:58.499 --> 00:35:04.222]  But I'm jolting people out of their status quo, and that's what we all have to do.
[00:35:05.043 --> 00:35:09.566]  You don't have to get somebody to believe exactly what you believe or to go out and take action immediately.
[00:35:09.906 --> 00:35:11.347]  It's only waking them up.
[00:35:11.547 --> 00:35:13.748]  America and the world need to awaken.
[00:35:14.088 --> 00:35:16.210]  Does that answer your question, Chad in Florida?
[00:35:17.671 --> 00:35:18.731]  Yes, yes it does.
[00:35:18.791 --> 00:35:24.094]  I mean, the one thing that I was pointing out was just what is everybody going to pay that set all this up?
[00:35:24.155 --> 00:35:26.376]  I mean, I'm concerned about that, you know.
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.541]  Well, I do want to bring the globalists to justice as well.
[00:35:30.861 --> 00:35:34.762]  But, I mean, first I'm just trying to slow down their operation.
[00:35:36.762 --> 00:35:38.583]  Then we can beat them, then we can bring them to justice.
[00:35:38.603 --> 00:35:39.383]  We'll be right back.
[00:35:41.943 --> 00:35:42.844]  We're on the march.
[00:35:43.324 --> 00:35:44.924]  The empire's on the run.
[00:35:45.864 --> 00:35:48.545]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:51.015 --> 00:35:52.115]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:35:52.395 --> 00:35:54.196]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:35:54.396 --> 00:35:55.036]  Well, you should.
[00:35:55.376 --> 00:35:59.618]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:35:59.858 --> 00:36:00.358]  That's right.
[00:36:00.678 --> 00:36:10.582]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[00:36:10.682 --> 00:36:11.822]  Plus, if you act fast,
[00:36:12.042 --> 00:36:17.664]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:36:18.025 --> 00:36:24.547]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:36:24.928 --> 00:36:30.110]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:31.591]  This is real.
[00:36:31.892 --> 00:36:32.632]  Don't miss out.

[00:36:51.272 --> 00:36:56.235]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:37:21.152 --> 00:37:21.352]  We're good.
[00:37:51.274 --> 00:37:52.835]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:37:52.955 --> 00:37:57.616]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:37:57.676 --> 00:38:00.437]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:38:00.638 --> 00:38:03.519]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:38:03.679 --> 00:38:09.541]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:38:09.761 --> 00:38:12.704]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you.
[00:38:13.004 --> 00:38:19.911]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:38:20.011 --> 00:38:23.134]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:38:23.274 --> 00:38:23.474]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:38:23.534 --> 00:38:25.156]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[00:38:28.419 --> 00:38:34.502]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:38:34.682 --> 00:38:38.444]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:38:38.464 --> 00:38:39.784]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:38:39.804 --> 00:38:40.385]  Take action today.
[00:38:40.425 --> 00:38:42.246]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:39:02.597 --> 00:39:14.707]  I know I've covered this repeatedly on air in the last few days, but you want to know what the solution is, I'm looking at it.
[00:39:16.288 --> 00:39:25.116]  And you heard the last caller where they went to a big event in Louisiana with all these different cabinet heads pushing
[00:39:27.315 --> 00:39:30.896]  For government takeover of health care, grabbing more of the economy.
[00:39:31.696 --> 00:39:33.337]  GM, Chrysler isn't enough.
[00:39:33.377 --> 00:39:36.898]  The banking isn't enough.
[00:39:36.918 --> 00:39:42.819]  23 plus trillion in the last nine months isn't enough for them.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.181]  This is John in Tampa Bay, Florida.
[00:39:49.161 --> 00:39:51.802]  Activity report for your encouragement.
[00:39:53.254 --> 00:39:55.815]  Hello, just to let you know what is happening in Tampa Bay.
[00:39:55.935 --> 00:40:06.198]  On July 4th holiday, I was able to get about 240 Obama deception videos at events that day, including a tea party on a major roadway.
[00:40:06.759 --> 00:40:09.179]  Cars at the intersection got the most DVDs.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.340]  Also, a fireworks event was a hit.
[00:40:14.261 --> 00:40:17.002]  At the fireworks event, the city of Tampa police officer approached me.
[00:40:17.482 --> 00:40:19.183]  I had on my attorney response team uniform.
[00:40:19.823 --> 00:40:22.344]  He saw what I was doing and he wanted a free DVD.
[00:40:23.982 --> 00:40:28.383]  I thanked him for taking it and told him we were depending on him to uphold the Constitution.
[00:40:28.863 --> 00:40:29.764]  He said he would do his best.
[00:40:30.884 --> 00:40:40.446]  This last Saturday, this is a week later, July 11th, I passed out DVDs at a busy intersection at a red light, passing them out to cars and pedestrians alike.
[00:40:41.066 --> 00:40:46.128]  At one point, a Hillsborough County Sheriff pulled up and rolled down his window.
[00:40:46.588 --> 00:40:50.169]  He asked, is this Alex Jones movie?
[00:40:50.289 --> 00:40:50.529]  Yes.
[00:40:51.604 --> 00:40:52.745]  I have watched it several times.
[00:40:53.205 --> 00:40:55.607]  He had a copy of the DVD on his car seat and showed me.
[00:40:55.867 --> 00:40:56.467]  I said, wow!
[00:40:57.308 --> 00:41:00.330]  A few minutes later he was able to pull off the road to talk.
[00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:10.036]  He said that his brother had sent him the DVD and he'd heard several of Alex's movies, had several of them, and was a regular listener of the radio show via internet.
[00:41:10.776 --> 00:41:13.858]  I told him also that we were depending on him to uphold the Constitution.
[00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:18.021]  We shook hands in parting and he said the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:41:21.288 --> 00:41:23.350]  Well, I was on cloud nine after this.
[00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:25.412]  I hope you're encouraged as well.
[00:41:25.892 --> 00:41:26.933]  I believe we're going to win.
[00:41:27.253 --> 00:41:27.814]  We have to.
[00:41:27.894 --> 00:41:31.217]  Sincerely, John in Tampa Bay, Florida.
[00:41:31.357 --> 00:41:39.304]  Now, there's a video I'm going to play a little bit later in the hour titled 21st Century Traitors.
[00:41:39.324 --> 00:41:43.829]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:41:44.149 --> 00:41:45.090]  Posted it this weekend.
[00:41:47.102 --> 00:41:52.024]  And this is police running warrantless checkpoints and arresting people that refuse to be searched.
[00:41:52.964 --> 00:41:56.005]  It's police telling folks they have to have a permit to protest.
[00:41:57.325 --> 00:42:02.887]  We've seen the videos of police coming and saying you can't stand off the side of a highway with a banner.
[00:42:04.088 --> 00:42:11.130]  Police saying that you can't stand out front of a mall on public property and hand out DVDs and arresting people.
[00:42:13.071 --> 00:42:16.472]  Our own cameramen had Federal Reserve security guards
[00:42:17.958 --> 00:42:28.301]  Walk half a mile down the road on the city property, there's a local World War I memorial in Kansas City, and say, we're going to arrest you if you don't leave.
[00:42:29.021 --> 00:42:34.322]  And my guys could have, I guess, just stayed and got arrested, but they wanted to, you know, get back to Austin with their footage.
[00:42:34.942 --> 00:42:36.563]  They'd been there to interview an economist.
[00:42:38.717 --> 00:42:40.558]  I mean, the point is, that's tyranny.
[00:42:41.379 --> 00:42:48.823]  So, that's 1984, and the answer is 1776, the police should be wanting political material.
[00:42:49.103 --> 00:42:50.304]  They should be involved.
[00:42:50.344 --> 00:42:58.749]  They should be there to guard people's First Amendment, and stop other people from attacking a demonstration.
[00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:03.492]  But instead, as you see in my mini-film,
[00:43:08.024 --> 00:43:19.631]  Battle for the Republic, the extra, one of the extras on Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, has Battle for the Republic featurette with extended interviews and footage.
[00:43:21.452 --> 00:43:24.134]  The illegal aliens are doing a non-permanent demonstration.
[00:43:24.654 --> 00:43:30.778]  They're blocking traffic for hours, huge tens of thousands in Seattle.
[00:43:34.013 --> 00:43:49.481]  Some of the citizens start protesting back, and the cops come over, take the guy out of the car, he's not resisting, ram his head into the ground, blood starts pouring out his eyebrows, the illegal aliens come over and celebrate, and the cops are high-fiving him.
[00:43:49.562 --> 00:43:50.042]  Yeah!
[00:43:50.622 --> 00:43:51.022]  Yeah!
[00:43:51.042 --> 00:43:59.467]  Because see, you the illegal alien, the invader, helping to break down the United States, bankrupt the states, you were smiled on by the globalists.
[00:44:01.084 --> 00:44:05.065]  But this citizen that dare protest back, he's bad.
[00:44:07.005 --> 00:44:07.225]  That's 1984.
[00:44:07.686 --> 00:44:10.126]  The answer to that is 1776.
[00:44:10.286 --> 00:44:19.788]  But let's go ahead now and play Hillary, being introduced by Richard N. Haas, head of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:44:20.929 --> 00:44:26.510]  And she says, you know, we get a lot of advice from you guys, and she says, I'm really glad there's a D.C.
[00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.751]  Council on Foreign Relations because it's closer than New York.
[00:44:31.874 --> 00:44:41.361]  The Council on Foreign Relations set up in 1921 by British intelligence publicly to help take over the United States as a Cecil Rhodes Roundtable Group.
[00:44:41.842 --> 00:44:43.203]  And Cecil Rhodes bragged about it.
[00:44:43.243 --> 00:44:47.766]  Carol Quigley wrote a book about it in 1969, the head of Georgetown Political Science.
[00:44:49.828 --> 00:45:01.497]  Just two weeks ago I showed you the Council on Foreign Relations website where it said the CFR has written Obama's Comprehensive Immigration Reform Plan.
[00:45:03.942 --> 00:45:06.703]  And that Jeb Bush has written it, and that Obama is going to adopt it.
[00:45:09.104 --> 00:45:13.505]  Showing that this tyranny is bipartisan, that there is no partisanship at the top.
[00:45:14.846 --> 00:45:21.448]  But the CFR, you have to read the CFR to see what the plan is going to say, because Congress is writing the bill now and is making it secret.
[00:45:21.888 --> 00:45:26.210]  But we always know what the bill is going to say, because the CFR probably writes.
[00:45:29.691 --> 00:45:31.291]  They write close to 100%.
[00:45:33.738 --> 00:45:35.679]  Of big policy bills.
[00:45:36.039 --> 00:45:36.979]  Healthcare, they wrote.
[00:45:38.139 --> 00:45:39.860]  Amnesty, the last four times they wrote.
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:41.660]  They slightly changed it.
[00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.540]  North American Union, SPP, they wrote.
[00:45:45.361 --> 00:45:47.461]  They wrote the greenhouse gas tax plan.
[00:45:47.902 --> 00:45:54.203]  They've written the terraforming geoengineering chemtrail report, written six years ago, now being adopted word for word.
[00:45:56.624 --> 00:46:00.565]  What you see from them years ago, word for word, is then in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:46:01.245 --> 00:46:01.885]  On every issue.
[00:46:05.279 --> 00:46:17.881]  They wrote the entire Homeland Security proposal that was then adopted word for word into law as this new giant bureaucracy above all federal agencies.
[00:46:19.542 --> 00:46:23.703]  And it's filled with CFR members, so it's a revolving door between government and the CFR.
[00:46:25.343 --> 00:46:26.663]  Here's the CFR, here's the government.
[00:46:26.683 --> 00:46:30.584]  They just, they interweave themselves.
[00:46:34.298 --> 00:46:35.059]  This is the government.
[00:46:35.619 --> 00:46:39.742]  And I had to, in college, hear Rush Limbaugh say it didn't exist.
[00:46:41.043 --> 00:46:44.566]  And if you're a new listener, know I'm not a Democrat or a Socialist or a Liberal.
[00:46:45.767 --> 00:46:50.670]  If you criticize Rush Limbaugh, that doesn't mean you're automatically in the Liberal-Conservative camp.
[00:46:51.511 --> 00:46:54.673]  I'm mad at the leftist publications that said it didn't exist.
[00:46:55.694 --> 00:47:00.498]  Because when you boil down Rush Limbaugh versus a Democrat pundit, it's the same thing.
[00:47:01.058 --> 00:47:02.039]  Just different rhetoric.
[00:47:02.239 --> 00:47:03.580]  But the same endgame.
[00:47:07.116 --> 00:47:18.689]  The issue is the CFR does exist and they brag everywhere, everywhere, that they are setting the policy and running this country.
[00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:26.037]  And in fact, now that I'm thinking about it, it's actually in Endgame, but pull up the clip
[00:47:27.765 --> 00:47:32.046]  Cheney says he doesn't tell constituents about CFR.
[00:47:32.126 --> 00:47:33.707]  He says the same thing, but worse.
[00:47:33.727 --> 00:47:39.808]  You know, I don't tell my constituents that I was the president of the CFR back home in Wyoming.
[00:47:41.669 --> 00:47:48.351]  Yeah, back 10 years ago, you couldn't tell your constituents it even existed.
[00:47:48.851 --> 00:47:51.732]  Because, you know, that's a conspiracy theorist thing.
[00:47:53.492 --> 00:47:55.573]  But see, now that they think they've got us where they want us,
[00:47:58.643 --> 00:48:00.884]  They're going ahead and announcing it all, but here she is.
[00:48:05.287 --> 00:48:10.150]  Thank you very much, Richard, and I am delighted to be here in these new headquarters.
[00:48:11.251 --> 00:48:21.217]  I have been often to, I guess, the mothership in New York City, but it's good to have an outpost of the Council right here down the street from the State Department.
[00:48:21.917 --> 00:48:26.100]  We get a lot of advice from the Council, so this will mean I won't have as far to go to
[00:48:27.267 --> 00:48:32.271]  Be told what we should be doing and how we should think about the future.
[00:48:32.932 --> 00:48:35.974]  Richard just gave what... Now did you see that?
[00:48:36.555 --> 00:48:42.740]  And her posture and her words, her body language is, you're my boss.
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:48.004]  And Richard in Haas is one of the co-presidents of America.
[00:48:49.145 --> 00:48:50.206]  In the power structure,
[00:48:52.961 --> 00:48:56.163]  It goes basically in government circles, quasi-government.
[00:48:56.744 --> 00:48:58.425]  Federal Reserve isn't government, it's private.
[00:48:58.705 --> 00:49:00.507]  Neither is the CFR, but they have government power.
[00:49:00.527 --> 00:49:05.671]  I mean, they write the real legislation, the master legislation, the master key.
[00:49:07.052 --> 00:49:08.032]  They are the key masters.
[00:49:13.857 --> 00:49:20.422]  Ben Bernanke, then under him, Treasury Secretary Geithner, under him, Richard Inhofe,
[00:49:22.099 --> 00:49:26.202]  And then advising all three of those posts as the Trilateral Commission Chairman.
[00:49:27.964 --> 00:49:40.994]  And then when you go to a CFR meeting to cover it, it's the heads of the CFR, head of the Trilateral Commission, head of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the heads of the world's major roundtable groups from the top 15, 20 governments are all there.
[00:49:43.419 --> 00:49:44.819]  The uh... G8s there.
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:46.800]  These are the guys.
[00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:47.500]  It's real funny.
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:52.682]  These guys have stolen twenty plus trillion in the last nine months and it's funny to them.
[00:49:53.682 --> 00:49:55.162]  And they're going to tax your toilet paper.
[00:49:55.482 --> 00:49:59.763]  They're going to tax beef, ice cream, your house, home inspections, youth brigades.
[00:50:00.984 --> 00:50:02.164]  And they're arming up, folks.
[00:50:02.244 --> 00:50:03.464]  These people are killers.
[00:50:04.545 --> 00:50:08.786]  Zbigniew Brzezinski, one of their chief advisors, wrote a book two years ago bragging
[00:50:09.591 --> 00:50:16.459]  That his government under Nixon funded Pol Pot that killed 3 million people or 30% of Cambodia.
[00:50:17.299 --> 00:50:19.582]  They'll pull a trigger on you in a minute.
[00:50:20.403 --> 00:50:26.590]  They're funding and writing, the CFR writes the plans for coups in third world countries.
[00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:29.453]  This is a gang of murdering crooks.
[00:50:31.792 --> 00:50:34.054]  Now there's over 4,000 members of the CFR now.
[00:50:34.294 --> 00:50:36.796]  The top 300 or so are murdering crooks.
[00:50:37.617 --> 00:50:40.799]  An Angelina Jolie or somebody, you know, she's going to join it.
[00:50:42.041 --> 00:50:42.841]  For whatever reasons.
[00:50:43.382 --> 00:50:44.222]  Doesn't look good though.
[00:50:44.823 --> 00:50:46.084]  Alright, let's go to Dick Cheney.
[00:50:46.124 --> 00:50:46.844]  Here's Dick Cheney.
[00:50:49.046 --> 00:50:50.608]  Saying he doesn't tell the slaves.
[00:50:51.248 --> 00:50:56.272]  I've been a member for a long time and was actually a director for some period of time.
[00:50:57.033 --> 00:51:00.516]  I never mentioned that when I was campaigning for re-election back home in Wyoming.
[00:51:02.142 --> 00:51:06.864]  Yeah, why don't you... That's a clip from Endgame.
[00:51:06.884 --> 00:51:09.965]  Why don't you find the longer clip, actually from C-Span.
[00:51:10.405 --> 00:51:14.006]  Try Dick Cheney CFR.
[00:51:14.206 --> 00:51:15.486]  It'll be one of the ones that comes up.
[00:51:16.167 --> 00:51:19.848]  Or try... And this is good we do this on air, because it shows others how to find this.
[00:51:19.908 --> 00:51:22.109]  I mean, it's like showing somebody how to ride a bike.
[00:51:22.149 --> 00:51:22.529]  It's easy.
[00:51:22.809 --> 00:51:24.990]  Not like saying, ooh, we know how to find stuff.
[00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:25.870]  Oh, we're so smart.
[00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:29.291]  It's good to show folks how easy it is to find stuff for themselves.
[00:51:31.696 --> 00:51:34.437]  Uh, try... Yeah, that's it.
[00:51:34.517 --> 00:51:34.817]  That's it.
[00:51:34.837 --> 00:51:38.337]  Dick Cheney, ex-director of CFR, Rockefeller.
[00:51:43.819 --> 00:51:44.559]  Yeah, start it over.
[00:51:44.599 --> 00:51:45.879]  Just back it up.
[00:51:46.199 --> 00:51:47.679]  We'll turn the audio up and we'll get it for folks.
[00:51:48.079 --> 00:51:50.460]  Yeah, here he is thanking David Rockefeller, his commander.
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:57.121]  A special televised meeting of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations provides a window to the real story.
[00:51:57.922 --> 00:52:00.142]  The speaker, Vice President Dick Cheney,
[00:52:00.839 --> 00:52:24.870]  Mr. Vice President, I just enjoyed so much your whole speech, but I was particularly pleased that you gave such a strong endorsement for the Free Trade Agreement for all the Americas, a subject that has been of great concern to me for many years, and particularly recently, and I think it's absolutely essential for the strength of our economy.
[00:52:26.252 --> 00:52:31.753]  Rockefeller's role in the drive for an FTAA was a lot more central than he portrays.
[00:52:32.493 --> 00:52:37.394]  Rockefeller cultivated Latin American leaders who could be counted on to support such a proposal.
[00:52:37.974 --> 00:52:46.156]  Both the 1994 Miami Summit and the FTAA proposal were conceived and nurtured by a Rockefeller-created network.
[00:52:46.896 --> 00:52:49.937]  Prominent among the organizations sponsoring the Miami event
[00:52:50.635 --> 00:52:51.195]  We're good to go.
[00:53:13.371 --> 00:53:16.634]  Rockefeller's influence also extends to the current administration.
[00:53:17.114 --> 00:53:26.742]  He was chairman emeritus of the CFR when Vice President Dick Cheney once served as a director, a relationship that Cheney concealed during his congressional career.
[00:53:27.523 --> 00:53:30.105]  It's good to be back at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:53:30.245 --> 00:53:36.190]  As Pete mentioned, I've been a member for a long time and was actually a director for some period of time.
[00:53:36.931 --> 00:53:40.454]  I never mentioned that when I was campaigning for re-election back home in Wyoming.
[00:53:44.278 --> 00:53:45.322]  Isn't it funny?
[00:53:45.342 --> 00:53:46.928]  Ha ha!
[00:53:47.229 --> 00:53:48.052]  The slaves!
[00:53:48.413 --> 00:53:49.898]  Oh God, we're robbing them!
[00:53:52.759 --> 00:53:56.841]  We put out MAAC reports to the cops, saying they're terrorists if they talk about us!
[00:53:58.382 --> 00:54:03.125]  We tell the cops the vets are the terrorists if they talk about imaginary CFR!
[00:54:03.325 --> 00:54:07.187]  And the best part is, the cops are buying it!
[00:54:07.227 --> 00:54:08.848]  God, we're building FEMA camps!
[00:54:09.629 --> 00:54:11.350]  It's so fun to rape them all!
[00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:13.531]  There's nothing this scum won't take!
[00:54:13.971 --> 00:54:15.072]  Yeah, baby!
[00:54:18.417 --> 00:54:20.378]  The best part is we're poisoning their water!
[00:54:21.139 --> 00:54:24.120]  Most of them are sterile and don't even care!
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:30.183]  87% of them have become sterile, and it's not even an issue with these idiots!
[00:54:31.164 --> 00:54:32.825]  They just don't even know why it's happening!
[00:54:35.566 --> 00:54:45.291]  And then they have hundreds of these little subgroups, which mayors and people are part of, and then the Rockefellers and the globalists, because they steal all the tax money, they sit there and fund them.
[00:54:45.691 --> 00:54:46.992]  And so your mayor may only get
[00:54:48.434 --> 00:54:54.381]  $10,000, $20,000 a year in a stipend, get to fly around five or six great destinations, be in a five-star hotel.
[00:54:56.264 --> 00:54:59.207]  Just for that, they'll sell your complete society out.
[00:54:59.948 --> 00:55:04.674]  Then the feds come in, teach them how to steal property, teach them how to set up pimp game operations.
[00:55:06.755 --> 00:55:07.656]  It's just all a big joke.
[00:55:07.696 --> 00:55:09.717]  Hillary, oh, I come here to get told what to do.
[00:55:09.738 --> 00:55:11.279]  Haas is like, yes, you do.
[00:55:11.879 --> 00:55:12.460]  Pimp game.
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:15.762]  Now get up there and tell them what needs to be done.
[00:55:15.923 --> 00:55:17.204]  You are my slave.
[00:55:17.964 --> 00:55:20.466]  And it's just all a big joke.
[00:55:20.907 --> 00:55:23.249]  Cheney, oh, thank you, David Rockefeller.
[00:55:23.749 --> 00:55:27.792]  We never tell the scum how it really works, do we?
[00:55:29.394 --> 00:55:31.756]  And they're now closing their final net of control.
[00:55:34.827 --> 00:55:38.909]  And they've stolen 24 trillion big ones.
[00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:42.671]  24 trillion big ones.
[00:55:42.751 --> 00:55:46.012]  And when we get back, I'm gonna play that clip for you.
[00:55:46.352 --> 00:55:49.174]  Cost of bailout hits a whopping $24 trillion.
[00:55:49.594 --> 00:55:54.156]  Paul Joseph Watson, 24 trill.
[00:55:55.376 --> 00:55:56.897]  Now three months ago, it was 14.8.
[00:55:59.638 --> 00:56:01.279]  What does this mean that it's now 24 trill?
[00:56:04.858 --> 00:56:07.820]  If you do the math, they are accelerating the stealing.
[00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:15.024]  That's 8.8 trill they've stolen in just two and a half, three months.
[00:56:16.024 --> 00:56:18.746]  And CNBC's very happy about all this.
[00:56:20.922 --> 00:56:22.123]  Woo-hoo, baby!
[00:56:22.583 --> 00:56:25.285]  We are... You're not leaving anything!
[00:56:25.345 --> 00:56:27.006]  No, we don't want them to be able to ever fight back again.
[00:56:27.026 --> 00:56:28.127]  We want to totally bankrupt them.
[00:56:28.467 --> 00:56:29.508]  Genius plan!
[00:56:30.208 --> 00:56:32.070]  Yes, and the police are standing by.
[00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:32.610]  What are they going to do?
[00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:33.210]  Quit their jobs?
[00:56:35.072 --> 00:56:35.952]  It's perfect!
[00:56:36.713 --> 00:56:41.236]  Oh, and we'll sit offshore while they try to fight back, and the cops and citizens kill each other.
[00:56:41.736 --> 00:56:42.857]  Genius plan!
[00:56:43.997 --> 00:56:45.358]  Oh, it's so good.
[00:56:45.959 --> 00:56:47.920]  It's so good to be running the damn game.
[00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:49.001]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:51.656 --> 00:56:54.679]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:58.644]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:56:58.944 --> 00:57:02.408]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:57:02.668 --> 00:57:09.616]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride,
[00:57:13.049 --> 00:57:13.269]  I think so.
[00:57:41.408 --> 00:57:44.130]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.771]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today!
[00:57:51.992 --> 00:57:57.294]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:57:57.794 --> 00:58:04.817]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:58:05.377 --> 00:58:11.540]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:13.802]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:13.942 --> 00:58:16.344]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:16.444 --> 00:58:27.393]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:58:28.013 --> 00:58:29.314]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:29.694 --> 00:58:31.055]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:58:31.536 --> 00:58:37.761]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:58:38.442 --> 00:58:46.209]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:46.709 --> 00:58:47.850]  The Obama Deception.
[00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:49.472]  The people strike back!
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:54.762]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:58:54.942 --> 00:58:59.004]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:58:59.184 --> 00:59:10.629]  Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:59:10.849 --> 00:59:16.672]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:59:16.912 --> 00:59:17.553]  We're good to go.
[00:59:37.196 --> 00:59:41.538]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:41.658 --> 00:59:44.359]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:04.986 --> 01:00:07.888]  Okay, I'm going to continue with these video clips, breaking them down.
[01:00:09.249 --> 01:00:11.610]  The 24 trillion stolen and counting.
[01:00:13.431 --> 01:00:17.954]  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, all announcing record profits.
[01:00:20.096 --> 01:00:23.238]  And remember, the Pentagon's standing by if you don't keep paying those foreign bankers.
[01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:29.817]  They told Congress, you do this or we're going to declare martial law and we're going to shut down the Congress.
[01:00:29.837 --> 01:00:35.821]  Well, Congress should have stood up at that point, but then Al-Qaeda would have detonated an A-bomb probably.
[01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:40.044]  See, the Congress knows they're dealing with major-level gangsters.
[01:00:40.624 --> 01:00:42.125]  Oh, you didn't give the bankers power?
[01:00:42.145 --> 01:00:44.927]  Oh, Al-Qaeda, yeah.
[01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:48.626]  Al-Qaeda hit Washington.
[01:00:49.367 --> 01:00:52.589]  The executive hates having to set up a dictatorship now.
[01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:55.892]  The continuity of government system just hates power.
[01:00:56.312 --> 01:01:03.398]  That's why they're in power and control, because they don't like to wield power, because they're not ruthless, because they're real nice and limp-wristed.
[01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:09.523]  And that's not just my opinion.
[01:01:10.043 --> 01:01:15.368]  The British 10-year Ministry of Defense perspective in
[01:01:17.779 --> 01:01:27.381]  2007 said that Western governments would simply neutron bomb any citizen group that tried to take over the Capitol or 10 Downing Street.
[01:01:28.501 --> 01:01:31.442]  If you ever try to have a revolution, they're just going to drop weapons on you.
[01:01:32.922 --> 01:01:35.222]  And if the Congress ever tries it, they're going to kill them.
[01:01:36.403 --> 01:01:43.144]  But, the good news is, we're going to take over the counties and the cities, and the idea of liberty is going to take over.
[01:01:44.184 --> 01:01:47.627]  You can't have one frontal assault, one battle with these people.
[01:01:47.947 --> 01:01:50.068]  Their whole architecture is built around defeating that.
[01:01:50.348 --> 01:01:52.210]  But they cannot stop you.
[01:01:52.290 --> 01:01:53.291]  You are immovable.
[01:01:53.731 --> 01:01:54.692]  You are inexorable.
[01:01:55.072 --> 01:01:57.293]  You are the unstoppable, terrible force.
[01:01:57.694 --> 01:02:05.339]  When you just decide to hand out DVDs and call into radio shows and go speak before city council and say no to bureaucrats and expose them.
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:10.343]  Just all of us doing it, it's just an unstoppable will, just taking the enemy and going,
[01:02:12.509 --> 01:02:14.631]  Just terminate them in the info war.
[01:02:14.651 --> 01:02:22.957]  Because they have to have your broken spirit, your broke back attitude for them to be able to succeed.
[01:02:22.977 --> 01:02:25.779]  They've got to have you capitulate to them.
[01:02:25.799 --> 01:02:27.120]  Well, don't capitulate!
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:34.526]  We're going to end this hour and then I'm going to play the clip about the 24 trillion and then get a guest on and continue with your calls.
[01:02:34.566 --> 01:02:36.147]  But I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors today.
[01:02:36.167 --> 01:02:36.888]  I haven't plugged yet.
[01:02:38.342 --> 01:02:42.347]  HeFoodsDirect.com is the name in high-quality, sterile foods.
[01:02:42.747 --> 01:02:44.089]  HeFoodsDirect.com.
[01:02:44.729 --> 01:02:47.192]  Do not wait with these scumbag, filth-running things.
[01:02:47.533 --> 01:02:48.954]  You need to be self-sufficient.
[01:02:49.014 --> 01:02:52.038]  Firearms, gold, silver, and number one, food and water.
[01:02:52.318 --> 01:02:54.641]  They got high-quality water filters, food, everything.
[01:02:54.761 --> 01:02:55.642]  They got a lot of great stuff.
[01:02:56.042 --> 01:02:58.966]  This is where I've chosen to buy my food, and then I said, hey, this is the best food I ever got.
[01:02:59.386 --> 01:03:00.407]  A lot of other stuff is crud.
[01:03:00.787 --> 01:03:02.649]  It's brand new, high-quality, non-GMO food.
[01:03:02.689 --> 01:03:03.970]  I said, I'm going to use eFoodsDirect.
[01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:05.491]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:03:05.671 --> 01:03:06.212]  eFoods.
[01:03:06.412 --> 01:03:07.673]  E-F-O-O-D-S.
[01:03:08.033 --> 01:03:08.714]  Direct.com.
[01:03:08.814 --> 01:03:09.975]  eFoodsDirect.com or 1-800-409-5633.
[01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:10.075]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:03:10.095 --> 01:03:10.816]  Do not wait.
[01:03:10.836 --> 01:03:11.617]  Do not procrastinate.
[01:03:11.637 --> 01:03:12.177]  Call them today.
[01:03:12.197 --> 01:03:13.018]  eFoodsDirect.com.

[01:03:13.198 --> 01:03:14.039]  Also, a home game.
[01:03:14.059 --> 01:03:16.341]  The Little Happy Max the Orange Gorilla.
[01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:29.292]  Link through at that at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:03:29.312 --> 01:03:30.832]  The site is absolutely free.
[01:03:31.173 --> 01:03:32.653]  HomeGain.com.
[01:03:34.274 --> 01:03:38.577]  They have the free home sale maximizer at HomeGain.com.
[01:03:39.037 --> 01:03:42.979]  The free home sale maximizer is my favorite.
[01:03:42.999 --> 01:03:48.862]  You put in your home address or info that tells you the best upgrades to make for your house.
[01:03:49.423 --> 01:03:50.943]  Or you don't have to put your address in either way.
[01:03:51.724 --> 01:03:53.325]  The cheapest things to do to get the highest
[01:03:54.245 --> 01:03:55.186]  sale value from it.
[01:03:55.646 --> 01:04:03.010]  There's also another system where you type in your home address, you get a free estimate on your home's value from the same internal systems that the realtors use.
[01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:04.951]  So find out what they think your home's really worth.

[01:04:12.816 --> 01:04:17.358]  We're going to go ahead and start the final hour here.
[01:04:19.179 --> 01:04:22.941]  And I will get to that video clip and news about the 24 Trail.
[01:04:24.932 --> 01:04:27.476]  Just 24 trill, double the GDP.
[01:04:28.337 --> 01:04:29.899]  The bankers need that money.
[01:04:31.571 --> 01:04:36.556]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:04:37.177 --> 01:04:40.440]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:45.064]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:04:45.304 --> 01:04:47.086]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:04:47.306 --> 01:04:55.574]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:04:55.814 --> 01:05:01.036]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:02.976]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:05:03.236 --> 01:05:09.558]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:05:09.738 --> 01:05:14.240]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:14.880]  We're good to go.
[01:05:44.053 --> 01:05:45.956]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:05:46.457 --> 01:05:49.220]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:25.823]  On October 3rd, Congress refused to pass legislation giving unlimited money to the private run for private federal reserve.
[01:06:28.506 --> 01:06:36.375]  They stole tens of trillions in the first three or four months and then held the money
[01:06:38.444 --> 01:06:40.725]  Held the money and stopped lending.
[01:06:41.485 --> 01:06:45.147]  And that actually drove up real interest rates, not what they claimed interest rates were of 0%.
[01:06:45.387 --> 01:06:49.168]  Actually drove up the cost of lending and less loans were made.
[01:06:50.829 --> 01:06:53.230]  And they've almost got the economy ripe, though.
[01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:55.051]  Things are imploding, things are falling apart.
[01:06:55.471 --> 01:07:00.733]  Now they're streaming in with the investment bankers, with your tax money, buying everything up.
[01:07:01.093 --> 01:07:05.175]  And remember, you pay the taxes, the $24 trillion now,
[01:07:06.792 --> 01:07:07.852]  Double the GDP.
[01:07:07.912 --> 01:07:10.073]  That's double the GDP.
[01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:10.953]  Say it with me.
[01:07:11.473 --> 01:07:13.554]  Double the GDP.
[01:07:13.574 --> 01:07:14.534]  24 trillion.
[01:07:16.675 --> 01:07:21.997]  That's more than double all the mortgages in the country.
[01:07:22.497 --> 01:07:24.137]  Not outstanding mortgages, all of them.
[01:07:24.498 --> 01:07:25.618]  The amount of taxes
[01:07:27.318 --> 01:07:30.179]  The amount of taxes each American is expected to pay for this.
[01:07:30.439 --> 01:07:32.400]  That's why they're announcing all the new carbon taxes.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.121]  Taxes on soda pop.
[01:07:35.501 --> 01:07:36.962]  Taxes on toilet paper.
[01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:38.262]  Taxes on beef.
[01:07:38.322 --> 01:07:39.402]  Taxes on plastic.
[01:07:39.863 --> 01:07:40.403]  Everything.
[01:07:40.883 --> 01:07:51.327]  Agencies given unlimited power to just levy any taxes they want, and they're all forming giant armored cadres of Soviet-style tax police to knock your teeth in.
[01:07:53.072 --> 01:07:54.813]  So get ready, here they come.
[01:07:54.873 --> 01:07:59.135]  It's like watching a trillion flesh-eating locusts flying towards you.
[01:08:00.236 --> 01:08:02.297]  And it is not a pretty situation.
[01:08:02.797 --> 01:08:06.459]  Cost of bailout hits a whopping $24 trillion.
[01:08:07.339 --> 01:08:09.280]  PrisonPlanet.com does a great analysis.
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.041]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:08:10.061 --> 01:08:11.541]  But let's show you CNBC.
[01:08:12.062 --> 01:08:12.662]  She gets it wrong.
[01:08:12.702 --> 01:08:13.902]  It says $27 trillion.
[01:08:14.163 --> 01:08:16.464]  With her high school education, she can't read off the teleprompter.
[01:08:17.164 --> 01:08:17.684]  I'm being mean.
[01:08:17.704 --> 01:08:18.445]  We all make mistakes.
[01:08:19.554 --> 01:08:21.776]  Especially a number that big, it's hard to read it correctly.
[01:08:22.096 --> 01:08:23.658]  And she corrects it for 24 Trill.
[01:08:24.459 --> 01:08:27.041]  But here she is, CNBC 24 Trill.
[01:08:27.521 --> 01:08:30.544]  That you're going to pay and you're going to pay interest on.
[01:08:32.586 --> 01:08:35.208]  You give it to the bankers and then you pay them.
[01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:40.413]  They loan it to you and you pay interest and they loan it to the government and you pay interest.
[01:08:41.694 --> 01:08:42.675]  Now that's a scam!
[01:08:43.851 --> 01:08:49.316]  That's like somebody comes and robs your car and they're driving off with it and then you've got to pay them to steal your car.
[01:08:51.357 --> 01:08:56.021]  Like somebody burns your house down and then you've got to pay them for the cost of them burning the house down.
[01:08:57.302 --> 01:08:57.903]  Go ahead and play her.
[01:08:59.410 --> 01:09:01.971]  Good to see you, Edward.
[01:09:01.991 --> 01:09:20.875]  We're waiting for the President on health care, and I see that you've also been blogging about this issue, what's been used, what's the TARP funds have been used for, and we're all kind of scratching our heads about this leaked testimony from the TARP inspector general who says that the ultimate government sponsorship could be 27 trillion, 23 trillion dollars, not to overstate it.
[01:09:22.841 --> 01:09:30.223]  We had a bit of a hint of this last week, I think, when Goldman reported its $3.5 billion quarter profits.
[01:09:30.263 --> 01:09:45.908]  We actually have a column on our site today, thedailybeast.com, by one Charlie Gasparino, who compares this use of TARP money to essentially giving Goldman, in this case, $100 to go to Vegas, making $1,000, and thanks very much, you get your $100 back.
[01:09:46.775 --> 01:09:48.497]  You know, we've kind of been down that road.
[01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:58.286]  We had Charlie on a little bit earlier, but, you know, to the points that we were making a little bit earlier on the air, we have heard from a number of banks that they are making loans.
[01:09:58.346 --> 01:10:06.134]  Bank of America, we mentioned a few moments ago, we talked to some community bankers who said that they are lending as well, and a number of other larger institutions that say they're lending.
[01:10:06.234 --> 01:10:08.236]  And besides, who's to say what the TARP money
[01:10:08.536 --> 01:10:10.017]  So there you have it.
[01:10:10.037 --> 01:10:11.638]  They just go on and basically say it's a good thing.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.061]  Oh, it's good.
[01:10:35.101 --> 01:10:36.163]  It's got the economy going.
[01:10:36.724 --> 01:10:38.747]  As the economy is in absolute free fall.
[01:10:39.087 --> 01:10:40.089]  Look at the actual numbers.
[01:10:40.129 --> 01:10:41.531]  They're hoarding the cash.
[01:10:42.753 --> 01:10:43.495]  So there you have it.
[01:10:44.316 --> 01:10:46.439]  We're going to get into the drugging of this nation.
[01:10:47.844 --> 01:10:51.026]  The THX1138 Raven World, straight ahead.
[01:10:51.186 --> 01:10:56.749]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[01:10:57.049 --> 01:10:58.210]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:10:58.350 --> 01:11:02.292]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[01:11:02.632 --> 01:11:04.153]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:11:04.493 --> 01:11:10.776]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[01:11:11.917 --> 01:11:14.478]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[01:11:14.798 --> 01:11:16.279]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[01:11:16.539 --> 01:11:19.300]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:20.981]  And their formula really works.
[01:11:21.261 --> 01:11:23.803]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:11:24.063 --> 01:11:25.323]  Try the Nutri-Cafe.
[01:11:25.563 --> 01:11:29.965]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[01:11:30.326 --> 01:11:32.527]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:11:32.747 --> 01:11:35.008]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:36.949]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:11:37.309 --> 01:11:38.429]  Go to www.
[01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:40.751]  We're good to go.
[01:11:51.311 --> 01:11:56.294]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:11:56.514 --> 01:12:00.317]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:12:00.537 --> 01:12:06.140]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:11.303]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:12:11.504 --> 01:12:11.964]  Number three,
[01:12:12.424 --> 01:12:17.867]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:12:18.707 --> 01:12:21.368]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:12:21.608 --> 01:12:25.810]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:29.752]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:12:29.992 --> 01:12:35.476]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:12:35.716 --> 01:12:40.280]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:12:54.821 --> 01:13:11.840]  The revolutionary Berkey Light self-sterilizing and recleanable purification elements purify water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels and by extracting harmful chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides, VOCs, organic solvents, radon-222, and trihalomethanes.
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:16.802]  They also reduce nitrates, nitrites, sediment, and unhealthy minerals such as lead and mercury.

[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:57.405]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:14:02.401 --> 01:14:05.663]  Well, I saw his film and I was really impressed.
[01:14:06.103 --> 01:14:10.345]  That's why we carry it on the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[01:14:10.565 --> 01:14:17.489]  In fact, if you go to InfoWars.com and look in the show guest area, we have a hybrid link to the film.
[01:14:18.669 --> 01:14:21.030]  It's Generation RX.
[01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:23.151]  Generation RX.
[01:14:23.231 --> 01:14:27.814]  And it goes over the history of the drugging of the children and adults and the horror stories.
[01:14:29.192 --> 01:14:36.480]  Kevin P. Miller began producing documentaries in the 1980s and was immediately rewarded with numerous international film and television awards for his efforts.
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:46.811]  His first documentary, The Promised Land, explored the abandonment of homeless military veterans and it won him many international film awards and other accolades.
[01:14:47.967 --> 01:14:53.593]  More importantly, it helped launch a string of hard-hitting documentaries about health care and other important issues over a 20-year period.
[01:14:53.933 --> 01:15:00.460]  Kevin P. Miller is being featured in the upcoming book, Dangerous Men, along with David Icke, Dr. Bruce Lipton and others.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:10.249]  His latest film is called Generation Rx, a documentary that examines how we are drugging our children earlier and more often than ever before with psychiatric medicines.
[01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:11.771]  It is, it's Paul Haggis.
[01:15:27.594 --> 01:15:28.295]  Fantastic.
[01:15:29.316 --> 01:15:50.014]  Listen, so much to go over, so much to cover here, but whenever I look into the drugging of children, the New Freedom Initiative with its own internal documents saying the goal is to put 50% of America's kids on psychotropics and anti-psychotics, these drugs brain damage people, they admit it causes suicide and psychopathic
[01:15:51.175 --> 01:15:54.158]  Outbursts, especially in people that are already prone to impulse control.
[01:15:54.638 --> 01:16:02.125]  They know what they're doing, and as society breaks down, and now they have drugs for the drugs.
[01:16:03.466 --> 01:16:12.414]  I've seen those ads on television, so this is a bottomless pit, it seems, and the public is pretty much unaware of it, so I appreciate you making this film.
[01:16:13.049 --> 01:16:18.791]  Well listen, it's a great honor to be on your show and I know that you've been covering the topic for a long time.
[01:16:19.611 --> 01:16:30.374]  When you talk about experimentation, that's already being done of course, and the foster kids who are already in the worst situation imaginable without parents.
[01:16:31.474 --> 01:16:36.357]  You know, they're being shifted around from house to house and institution to institution.
[01:16:37.058 --> 01:16:49.605]  And in California, Massachusetts, many states around the country, Florida for one, over 75% of the foster kids are already on antipsychotic medications, Alex.
[01:16:49.665 --> 01:16:52.527]  So, I mean, it doesn't get much uglier than that, frankly.
[01:16:54.568 --> 01:16:55.028]  Continue.
[01:16:55.888 --> 01:17:09.298]  Well, I think that the reality is that when you've got 75% of the most vulnerable kids on antipsychotic medications, you know that there's some kind of trial going on.
[01:17:09.318 --> 01:17:10.539]  They're dumbing down people.
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:20.667]  And frankly, you know, this is what we're putting another, you know, 10 million or so kids who are diagnosed as, quote, bipolar disorder.
[01:17:21.248 --> 01:17:25.471]  That's the exact class of drugs that kids are being put on.
[01:17:26.284 --> 01:17:33.567]  And so, you know, it's really an ugly thing, and it's only made uglier by the fact that our tax dollars are supporting it.
[01:17:34.407 --> 01:17:46.372]  In Florida, for example, that 75% of the foster kids that I was mentioning to you, I think it's 55 to 58% of those are being paid for by Medicare.
[01:17:47.672 --> 01:17:51.774]  So, you know, it's a ridiculous, heinous situation.
[01:17:54.361 --> 01:18:07.531]  Now, when you talk about 75% in some states, the national average, at least when I made Endgame two years ago, was 69% of the nation's foster children are on psychotropics.
[01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:17.278]  And you're right that even then, I saw the number of 80%, approaching 80%, being on the drugs in some states.
[01:18:17.978 --> 01:18:23.002]  And they did a study in Texas, and we even have some committee hearing clips in Endgame
[01:18:24.298 --> 01:18:27.680]  Where the state psychiatrist says, well, it's eugenics.
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:29.061]  They have bad gene pools.
[01:18:29.621 --> 01:18:34.704]  It's why we're putting upwards of 70% in the case of Texas on them.
[01:18:35.224 --> 01:18:36.765]  But as you said, some states even higher.
[01:18:36.785 --> 01:18:42.529]  I mean, just let that sink in for the listeners out there.
[01:18:42.549 --> 01:18:50.514]  75% of foster children on psychotropics and anti-psychotics, but don't stop there,
[01:18:51.522 --> 01:19:03.467]  The Texas report from WOAI-TV in San Antonio, itself from the state's own numbers, said they're on an average of seven drugs.
[01:19:04.827 --> 01:19:14.071]  And there were medical doctors on the TV program, that we play clips of here, saying they would see a healthy kid at say three years old that got grabbed by foster parents.
[01:19:15.066 --> 01:19:15.326]  I don't know.
[01:19:27.150 --> 01:19:38.700]  And you're talking about what conventional journalists are reporting, Alex, and so that makes it even more shocking because we know that there's this one-hand-feeds-the-other kind of attitude in the mainstream media.
[01:19:39.081 --> 01:19:44.726]  I mean, one of the guys in my film, Robert Whitaker, a former science journalist who basically is
[01:19:45.286 --> 01:19:46.767]  He's almost blackballed.
[01:19:46.807 --> 01:19:55.290]  He almost can't find a job in conventional journalism anymore because he co-wrote a series on psychiatric research for the Boston Globe.
[01:19:55.910 --> 01:20:05.873]  And part of what he told me in the interview was that it's literally one out of every 70 children in the United States who are on anti-psychotic medications alone.
[01:20:05.953 --> 01:20:10.855]  Of course, the number is higher if you include Ritalin and antidepressants and the like.
[01:20:10.935 --> 01:20:12.636]  So, this is not a lark.
[01:20:12.736 --> 01:20:13.676]  This isn't a fluke.
[01:20:14.076 --> 01:20:26.298]  This is something, as you say, that the medical doctors and the medical establishment sure as hell know what they're doing, and it's been going on now pretty ardently since about 1970.
[01:20:27.038 --> 01:20:28.499]  Yeah, this is THX 1138.
[01:20:28.779 --> 01:20:42.501]  This is Brave New World, and Aldous Huxley, in 62, shortly before his death at Berkeley, and folks can watch the film and the audio online, just Google Aldous Huxley Berkeley speech,
[01:20:43.496 --> 01:20:50.229]  He says that, hey, everything in my book is what the eugenic social planners were planning in 1930.
[01:20:52.361 --> 01:20:58.303]  And so everything I'm saying in the book is going to come true after 2000 is our plan.
[01:20:58.803 --> 01:21:05.566]  And by the way, my brother runs the United Nations UNESCO program as the Secretary General of UNESCO.
[01:21:06.046 --> 01:21:09.687]  These people mean business and they've now done it.
[01:21:11.248 --> 01:21:16.390]  I'm sure you saw the new freedom initiative that came out four years ago when the documents got leaked where they want to
[01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:22.712]  Force at least half the kids in the next phase on drugs and then after that everyone on drugs?
[01:21:23.853 --> 01:21:25.153]  I mean this is really happening.
[01:21:26.073 --> 01:21:43.320]  Well I think that the timing of Generation RX is really extraordinary because it was rolled out just around the same time that again our friends, our cohorts in the mainstream media, New York Times and LA Times and Washington Post were starting to
[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:44.781]  We're good to go.
[01:22:01.174 --> 01:22:10.219]  Yeah, I found out that the school nurses get weird kickbacks in payola, and so they push it on the kids and say, oh here's a psychologist, here's a card.
[01:22:10.399 --> 01:22:14.922]  They're just like drug pushers, but they're not out on the playground selling the kids crack.
[01:22:15.242 --> 01:22:18.864]  They're doing it in the school, and they'll send the cops if you don't take it.
[01:22:19.554 --> 01:22:39.765]  Well, what's funny is that we say in the film, I think it's Dr. Julian Whitaker, my good friend, the medical doctor from Los Angeles, and he says, you know, it's comical because the very same drugs that they will arrest you for if you're walking down the street in front of a school are what the kids in the schools themselves are lining up to get from those very nurses.
[01:22:40.365 --> 01:22:45.309]  So, you know, you're exactly correct and this is not a surprise nor is it a secret.
[01:22:45.809 --> 01:22:59.198]  I mean, each kid gets four to five hundred dollars for the school itself and for the school district if they are on these drugs because they are classified in a certain kind of a way that gets
[01:22:59.298 --> 01:23:00.219]  Government dollars.
[01:23:00.359 --> 01:23:01.120]  Special needs.
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:06.244]  And now, some schools, a third or more of the schools special needs, and soon it's going to be half.
[01:23:06.724 --> 01:23:13.810]  And then, just like THX 1138, pretty soon, kids in wheelchairs with nozzles into their nose and drug injectors.
[01:23:15.752 --> 01:23:19.215]  I mean, it's so nightmarish the soft kill they're running.
[01:23:19.595 --> 01:23:21.877]  And then they say it's for eugenics in the state of Texas.
[01:23:21.897 --> 01:23:24.420]  They say they're giving us racial hygiene.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.202]  Start with the film.
[01:23:26.262 --> 01:23:31.150]  Tell us about the film because I really want people to get this on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:23:31.170 --> 01:23:35.817]  I want them to have viewing parties, show it to local community groups, school boards.
[01:23:36.158 --> 01:23:38.702]  We've got to get Generation RX out to people.
[01:23:39.244 --> 01:23:40.465]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:23:40.565 --> 01:23:48.512]  The film really came as a result of, in 2004, I was filming in Washington, something completely unintended.
[01:23:48.532 --> 01:23:58.680]  I ended up at a Food and Drug Administration hearing where they were a bunch of people who were standing before the FDA committee talking about the side effects of Prozac.
[01:23:59.441 --> 01:24:06.267]  And as I was filming over the two-hour period or whatever, it kicked into me that, my God, I've heard this all before.
[01:24:07.057 --> 01:24:26.671]  And it turns out that I had originally heard it in a videotape from 1991 where the American citizens, 40, 50, 60 of them, were standing before the FDA a year after Prozac had been on the market saying, you know, my mother stabbed my father, my sister hung herself.
[01:24:27.231 --> 01:24:31.114]  Every imaginable, awful, frightening story that you can imagine.
[01:24:31.695 --> 01:24:41.562]  And so when I realized that nothing had changed in that period of time, in fact, it had gotten worse, and more kids had gotten on these medications, I said, nothing's changing.
[01:24:41.622 --> 01:24:43.884]  I need to produce a film about this.
[01:24:44.605 --> 01:24:52.491]  And so I got started on that path, and really, you know, uncovered all of the collusion
[01:24:53.166 --> 01:25:02.509]  And certainly all the negligent, and I say criminal, behavior at the Food and Drug Administration, where of course corruption is so endemic as it's always been.
[01:25:03.049 --> 01:25:12.212]  But people like Thomas Loughran at the FDA, who's the head of their psychopharmacology division, and who approved Zoloft for children.
[01:25:13.452 --> 01:25:20.515]  And Michael R. Taylor, who's back from Monsanto after a gig at the FDA in the early 1990s,
[01:25:21.975 --> 01:25:26.916]  When I interviewed him and who also tried to eliminate dietary supplements.
[01:25:27.637 --> 01:25:30.177]  And Robert Temple, another FDA official.
[01:25:30.577 --> 01:25:42.821]  So all of these men bounding together, banding together with the pharmaceutical companies to cover up the side effects and basically to implement their dastardly intentions on our kids.
[01:25:43.981 --> 01:25:46.542]  And boy, it's been a devastating blackout.
[01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:49.443]  And they have death education, teach them how to commit suicide.
[01:25:49.843 --> 01:25:50.803]  Those numbers explode.
[01:25:51.604 --> 01:26:01.714]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:26:02.174 --> 01:26:03.235]  Garden in a Can!

[01:26:51.036 --> 01:26:56.338]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:26:56.839 --> 01:27:03.842]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:27:04.442 --> 01:27:10.585]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:27:11.025 --> 01:27:12.847]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:27:12.987 --> 01:27:15.409]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:27:15.489 --> 01:27:26.439]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:27:27.059 --> 01:27:28.360]  It's not about left or right.
[01:27:28.741 --> 01:27:30.142]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:27:30.602 --> 01:27:36.828]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:27:45.770 --> 01:27:46.911]  The Obama Deception.
[01:27:47.331 --> 01:27:48.533]  The people strike back!
[01:27:50.273 --> 01:27:50.713]  Gold.
[01:27:51.054 --> 01:27:52.334]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:27:52.594 --> 01:27:58.698]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:27:58.878 --> 01:28:02.701]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:28:03.061 --> 01:28:04.942]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:28:05.002 --> 01:28:07.284]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:28:07.424 --> 01:28:14.328]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker and

[01:28:49.836 --> 01:28:56.882]  As you already know, drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:28:57.223 --> 01:29:01.626]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:29:01.887 --> 01:29:06.751]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[01:29:07.091 --> 01:29:14.577]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:29:14.817 --> 01:29:19.101]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[01:29:19.401 --> 01:29:25.306]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:29:25.586 --> 01:29:31.352]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[01:30:01.973 --> 01:30:10.103]  Kevin Miller, director and producer of the film, Generation RX, is our guest.
[01:30:12.423 --> 01:30:18.868]  Of course, in the early 80s it did come out that they knew it caused massive increases in suicides, just Prozac alone.
[01:30:19.729 --> 01:30:28.136]  And after decades of fighting, they now admit on the Prozac and other variants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, that it does cause that.
[01:30:28.156 --> 01:30:29.276]  So it's an oxymoron.
[01:30:30.342 --> 01:30:41.408]  And nine times out of ten of the cases I've seen, they put them on one drug, then it doesn't work, they put them on two or three, four, and they end up in a mental institution, or committing suicide, or going crazy, or finally get off the drugs.
[01:30:41.488 --> 01:30:43.909]  But you have to get them off, you have to go off slowly.
[01:30:44.589 --> 01:30:45.910]  That can cause even bigger problems.
[01:30:47.631 --> 01:30:50.772]  But now they have drugs to treat the drugs.
[01:30:51.993 --> 01:30:55.174]  I see the TV ad saying, oh, you've got mental problems from your Prozac.
[01:30:55.194 --> 01:30:56.255]  Well, take this drug.
[01:30:56.775 --> 01:30:58.076]  It'll take care of the Prozac.
[01:30:59.522 --> 01:31:00.823]  It's just totally sick.
[01:31:02.183 --> 01:31:07.446]  Please continue with the story you were telling about all these men working together to carry out this great evil.
[01:31:08.106 --> 01:31:14.609]  Well, I think, Alex, it's just that the medical ethics have just completely gone out the window.
[01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:18.871]  If they ever existed, they are long in the distant past by now.
[01:31:21.004 --> 01:31:35.635]  Frankly, you know, these men, when you mentioned Prozac, the original study that we unearthed, and we found paperwork to track this, as you know, I mean, 1982 were the first tests that were done on Prozac, and they were done in Germany.
[01:31:36.475 --> 01:31:42.960]  And the German equivalent of the FDA basically said, you know, there's a real problem with this drug.
[01:31:43.564 --> 01:31:50.987]  In the first trial alone, 16 people tried to kill themselves, and we're talking about 16 out of the first 43 or something.
[01:31:51.187 --> 01:31:53.168]  And others attack people, but that's great.
[01:31:53.188 --> 01:31:57.450]  You put a bunch of kids on that and give them guns, then you have an excuse to ban the Second Amendment.
[01:31:57.910 --> 01:32:10.676]  Well, and you know, I've heard, I've been listening to your program for many years, and I heard someone attack you once about the fact that you mentioned that the Columbine killers and some of the other people have been on drugs.
[01:32:10.796 --> 01:32:11.216]  Let me just
[01:32:11.676 --> 01:32:15.779]  Put this nonsense on the other side to rest once and for all.
[01:32:16.319 --> 01:32:28.527]  It is absolutely a fact that at the bare minimum, 8 out of the last 12 school shooters around the country were indeed on these antidepressant drugs.
[01:32:29.008 --> 01:32:38.574]  It probably was at least 9 out of the last 12, but they sealed the records of one of the Columbine killers, and so none of us know for certain
[01:32:38.874 --> 01:32:47.282]  Yeah, but his friends said he was on Ritalin and Prozac, but you're right, they sealed it and then the other one was on it.
[01:32:47.762 --> 01:32:48.883]  That's exactly right.
[01:32:49.223 --> 01:32:51.505]  And we know that he was going to a psychiatrist.
[01:32:51.706 --> 01:32:58.572]  So, I mean, you know, how many troubled kids, as you said before, would not be prescribed these antidepressant drugs?
[01:32:59.198 --> 01:33:03.302]  So, you know, what they started with was something very commonsensical.
[01:33:03.342 --> 01:33:10.109]  They started with the ADHD aspect, and they really tried to just control the kid's behavior.
[01:33:10.389 --> 01:33:12.491]  Then all of a sudden there was a problem.
[01:33:12.531 --> 01:33:22.141]  There was the DEA of all agencies coming out and saying, wait a minute, there's a problem with this methylphenidate, with Ritalin, with these stimulant drugs.
[01:33:22.671 --> 01:33:31.276]  And they're causing this vast array of side effects, and violent side effects were among them, and addiction problems, and all the rest of it.
[01:33:31.836 --> 01:33:39.240]  And so, you know, then they went into a big PR campaign to basically combat the DEA.
[01:33:40.704 --> 01:33:53.861]  Uh, and, you know, this is the mid-1990s, and there was a 734% increase in the number of kids that were prescribed Ritalin for, quote, ADHD drug from 1990 to 1994 alone.
[01:33:58.076 --> 01:34:05.762]  And then, the kids that go on the Ritalin, then the kids that get on Ritalin tend to get depressed, so then they put them on Prozac-type drugs, don't they?
[01:34:05.782 --> 01:34:20.434]  And then, as kids start committing suicide and killing other people and hurting other people, there's mental illness at the school, everybody's got to be screened now by the New Freedom, and then lo and behold, the psychologists find that everybody needs to be put on drugs.
[01:34:20.882 --> 01:34:22.242]  Well, here's the crazy part of it.
[01:34:22.322 --> 01:34:24.163]  As you say, they put the kids on Ritalin.
[01:34:24.583 --> 01:34:26.363]  So, first they start them on a lower dose.
[01:34:26.443 --> 01:34:30.624]  They might be five years old or six years old or maybe even four years old.
[01:34:31.505 --> 01:34:36.866]  And then, after a while, they note that that same dose of Ritalin isn't, quote, working.
[01:34:36.946 --> 01:34:42.147]  The kid seems to be, you know, exercising his own ability and his own intellect.
[01:34:42.568 --> 01:34:44.088]  So, then they raise the dose.
[01:34:44.688 --> 01:34:49.190]  Well, then what happens is it kicks in with a side effect that's very well known.
[01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:53.632]  After they raise the dose of the Ritalin, the child has a psychotic reaction.
[01:34:54.292 --> 01:35:02.455]  So once the child has a psychotic reaction, they rush the kid to the doctor because he's talking crazy and he's a mile a minute and just can't be controlled.
[01:35:02.775 --> 01:35:08.677]  And the doctor, instead of saying, oh, that's a well-known side effect of methylphenidate, of Ritalin, we gave him too much.
[01:35:08.717 --> 01:35:10.258]  We need to take him off this drug.
[01:35:10.478 --> 01:35:12.539]  No, they don't say that, as you know, Alex.
[01:35:12.939 --> 01:35:14.800]  Then they say he's bipolar.
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:24.343]  Now he's bipolar, so now we put him on these powerful, potent, dangerous antipsychotic drugs for which there is no cure.
[01:35:25.023 --> 01:35:26.764]  This is what we're doing to our generation.
[01:35:41.621 --> 01:35:44.607]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:35:45.549 --> 01:35:48.254]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:51.069 --> 01:35:52.170]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:35:52.451 --> 01:35:54.233]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:35:54.433 --> 01:35:55.094]  Well, you should.
[01:35:55.434 --> 01:35:59.679]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:35:59.919 --> 01:36:00.420]  That's right.

[01:36:18.076 --> 01:36:24.598]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:36:24.959 --> 01:36:30.141]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[01:36:51.442 --> 01:36:53.003]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:36:53.123 --> 01:36:57.785]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:36:57.865 --> 01:37:00.627]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:37:00.827 --> 01:37:03.689]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:37:03.869 --> 01:37:09.712]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:37:09.952 --> 01:37:12.895]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:37:13.195 --> 01:37:20.102]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[01:37:40.522 --> 01:37:42.604]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:37:51.394 --> 01:37:54.236]  Did you know that you can be tracked and traced when you're online?
[01:37:54.496 --> 01:38:02.382]  With identity theft and cyber crimes on the rise, your passwords, your identity, and even your physical location can be revealed to complete strangers.
[01:38:02.622 --> 01:38:06.305]  Would you like to surf the internet anonymously and not have to worry about these threats?
[01:38:06.565 --> 01:38:09.567]  Well, now you can by visiting patriotinternet.com.

[01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:13.670]  We're good.
[01:38:38.063 --> 01:38:40.805]  Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.
[01:38:40.825 --> 01:38:41.066]  Nothing.
[01:38:41.086 --> 01:38:42.587]  I mean nothing, honey, if it ain't free.
[01:39:05.603 --> 01:39:09.946]  I want to talk to our guest more about the film and the families he talks to and the information he brings out.
[01:39:09.966 --> 01:39:10.927]  It's so well done.
[01:39:11.627 --> 01:39:14.149]  Generation RX available at Infowars.com.
[01:39:15.170 --> 01:39:17.431]  But then I want to talk about solutions, where this is going.
[01:39:17.471 --> 01:39:21.334]  I mean, if we don't expose these people and fight them, they're going to make everybody take drugs.
[01:39:21.354 --> 01:39:23.976]  And they're now to the point of trying to make the kids take it.
[01:39:24.036 --> 01:39:29.760]  And I had a writer for Psychology Today calling me for some big cover story that's coming out soon.
[01:39:32.621 --> 01:39:39.548]  And I would bring up the fact that it's not normal to have more than two-thirds of the kids on these drugs, and he would just laugh at me.
[01:39:39.568 --> 01:39:41.751]  I mean, it's all just a big joke to these people.
[01:39:41.791 --> 01:39:42.932]  It's all just a big business.
[01:39:43.873 --> 01:39:45.374]  A very, very sickening guild.
[01:39:46.657 --> 01:39:52.002]  Folks, having 75% of kids on strong anti-psychotics and other drugs, that isn't normal.
[01:39:52.282 --> 01:39:53.984]  Having 5% on it isn't normal.
[01:39:54.565 --> 01:40:00.010]  Somebody shouldn't be on drugs unless they were already trying to kill people and already trying to chew their fingers off.
[01:40:00.690 --> 01:40:04.414]  Somebody shouldn't be on these dangerous drugs even if they think they're the Pope.
[01:40:04.974 --> 01:40:06.135]  They're nutty and that's the end of it.
[01:40:06.175 --> 01:40:11.040]  No, they say all normal behavior is abnormal because it's their business model.
[01:40:12.025 --> 01:40:12.986]  This is the new priesthood.
[01:40:13.006 --> 01:40:16.750]  We're going to go back to Kevin Miller here in just a moment with Generation RX.
[01:40:17.391 --> 01:40:20.854]  I do want to tell you about a few of our sponsors that have made today's show possible.
[01:40:22.896 --> 01:40:26.740]  One of them is something that every one of my listeners needs to have.
[01:40:27.001 --> 01:40:27.881]  I have one in my car.
[01:40:29.226 --> 01:40:47.855]  You should have one, whether it's just the little secret pen recorder, or whether it's the little bit more expensive in-car system that's hidden cameras in your car that you just hit a button, and the cameras start recording what the police or others are doing, and then you've got a secret record of what happened.
[01:40:48.456 --> 01:40:51.777]  And the website is diginet.net.
[01:40:51.957 --> 01:40:56.360]  That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:57.460]  Diginet.net.
[01:40:59.594 --> 01:41:02.735]  And everybody should have one of the DigiPens.
[01:41:03.415 --> 01:41:05.676]  These are the best pens for the best price I've seen anywhere.
[01:41:06.036 --> 01:41:07.416]  So, Diginet.net.
[01:41:07.816 --> 01:41:10.457]  But I suggest, and I mean to get one, I've just been so busy.
[01:41:10.477 --> 01:41:11.197]  I know we all are.
[01:41:11.597 --> 01:41:19.379]  It's very, very affordable, very inexpensive to get two gig, four gig models for your car that'll record for hours.
[01:41:20.439 --> 01:41:22.940]  And it's just little hidden cameras going into a little
[01:41:24.797 --> 01:41:27.358]  A recorder unit and stored on a little memory disk.
[01:41:28.018 --> 01:41:32.480]  It's absolutely essential that we use Big Brother tools against the establishment.
[01:41:33.981 --> 01:41:37.322]  In this time and date, everybody needs to protect themselves.
[01:41:38.102 --> 01:41:44.345]  So, I'm thinking I have to have this on my car just when nuts show up in a parking lot and try to do weird stuff to me.
[01:41:44.365 --> 01:41:49.147]  I've had that happen a few times and then later I drive off and hear them tell people something completely untrue.
[01:41:50.166 --> 01:41:52.888]  I mean, it's just good to have this to protect yourself.
[01:41:52.928 --> 01:41:53.928]  Diginet.net.
[01:41:54.368 --> 01:41:55.609]  Diginet.net.
[01:41:56.670 --> 01:42:02.473]  And finally, I want to tell you about the great folks at Survival Seed Bank.
[01:42:04.096 --> 01:42:10.239]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[01:42:10.299 --> 01:42:16.082]  There have been times in American history, Pilgrim for example, when seeds have the highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold.
[01:42:16.482 --> 01:42:21.684]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds, waged by the global elite, who want to control us by controlling the food supply.
[01:42:22.145 --> 01:42:27.227]  Governments are storing seeds, the UN is storing seeds, globalists of every stripe are storing seeds in the Arctic Circle.
[01:42:27.627 --> 01:42:28.628]  Why do you think they're doing this?
[01:42:29.068 --> 01:42:29.548]  You know why.
[01:42:29.628 --> 01:42:30.589]  Control and power.
[01:42:31.229 --> 01:42:35.311]  Solutions from science is trying to get the seeds out of the globalist's hands and into the hands of the people.
[01:42:35.711 --> 01:42:36.631]  This is the place to get them.
[01:42:36.891 --> 01:42:37.872]  Survival Seed Bank.
[01:42:38.672 --> 01:42:40.773]  Get them out of the hands of the elite and into the hands of the people.
[01:42:41.093 --> 01:42:42.633]  SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:42:42.653 --> 01:42:44.954]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com or 877-327-0365.
[01:42:44.974 --> 01:42:45.014]  877-327-0365.
[01:42:45.054 --> 01:42:45.675]  SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:42:45.695 --> 01:42:46.635]  Okay, going back to our guest.
[01:42:55.118 --> 01:42:57.559]  With the film Generation RX.
[01:42:58.459 --> 01:43:19.086]  Mr. Miller, continuing where we left off after that last break, how they put you on the speed drugs, the amphetamine class, which then everybody knows speed freaks are nuts, they keep upping the dose, when they stop sleeping or act weird or are up sometimes and down other times, they don't go, hey, that's what speed freaks do!
[01:43:20.051 --> 01:43:25.972]  Causes heart palpitations, heart enlargement, brain shrinkage, all these physical problems, they admit.
[01:43:27.213 --> 01:43:31.734]  No, because they're a psychiatric guild, a drug-pushing guild.
[01:43:32.294 --> 01:43:34.294]  They don't say, hey, our drug did that.
[01:43:34.614 --> 01:43:38.195]  The very culprit says, oh yes, now we put you on Prozac.
[01:43:38.635 --> 01:43:39.356]  Please continue.
[01:43:39.376 --> 01:43:41.076]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:43:41.316 --> 01:43:48.998]  And once they have a psychotic reaction and they get put on an anti-psychotic medication, there basically is no cure.
[01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:50.491]  At that point.
[01:43:50.551 --> 01:43:55.897]  So they tell you straight up, you could be 16 years old, 12, 11, doesn't matter.
[01:43:55.977 --> 01:43:58.521]  They'll tell you that you're going to be on drugs the rest of your life.
[01:43:59.502 --> 01:44:07.872]  And you know, this is, this is one of the main things that really propelled me to produce this film.
[01:44:08.419 --> 01:44:11.620]  I could see nothing beyond the murder and the mayhem.
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:20.902]  I could see no sanity, literally, coming out of the medical establishment or the FDA or the American Psychiatric Association.
[01:44:21.942 --> 01:44:34.425]  And, you know, you start seeing, when you peel back the dirty layers, you start seeing how many people who are making the decisions on these drugs are getting payola from the drug companies themselves.
[01:44:35.188 --> 01:44:59.095]  I mean, how can it be, you know, I think we're around the same age, Alex, how can it be that, you know, in the record company executives from the 70s and 80s were thrown in prison for payola for getting a few dollars under the table to get a record played on the radio, and yet we've got researchers and scientists and doctors and decision makers who are getting millions
[01:45:00.362 --> 01:45:06.464]  of dollars under the table not reporting it and still walking around free as a bird.
[01:45:07.225 --> 01:45:23.871]  Well let me expand on that just on a separate issue but it's it's it's connects into this you can just google the term IRS agents cut from billionaires and there's all these news articles where they got rid of almost all over ninety percent
[01:45:24.964 --> 01:45:28.467]  of the corporate fraud investigators from the IRS.
[01:45:28.487 --> 01:45:30.248]  Now you can argue is it a fair tax or not.
[01:45:30.328 --> 01:45:31.589]  Obviously that's a scam too.
[01:45:31.949 --> 01:45:38.474]  But the issue is they don't enforce on billionaires, they enforce on middle class and blue collar workers.
[01:45:39.435 --> 01:45:45.639]  Because the criminal class, that's why it came out that more than half of Congress doesn't even pay the taxes.
[01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:48.581]  I mean this is an openly criminal group.
[01:45:48.821 --> 01:45:49.182]  Go ahead.
[01:45:49.932 --> 01:45:51.633]  No, I couldn't agree more.
[01:45:52.033 --> 01:46:15.907]  And yet you've got a minimum, this is a bare minimum, done by studies, proved by studies from Boston University researchers and others, that say that a bare minimum of 56% of the people who are on the panels that decide which drugs get dispensed to our children, 56% is the minimum number of people who also have conflicts of interest with the drug companies.
[01:46:16.508 --> 01:46:36.301]  Well, on some committees, and you're talking about the anti-psychotic drugs and schizophrenia groups, 100% of the decision makers on the committee that are ruling on which drugs are dispensed to the general public, 100% of them are getting money from the drug companies.
[01:46:36.701 --> 01:46:45.087]  Speakers fees, traveling events, hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars that they then don't even declare.
[01:46:46.684 --> 01:46:49.185]  to the general public that there is a conflict.
[01:46:49.685 --> 01:47:00.430]  Now, you know, in any other entity, if you had conflicts of interest with Boeing and airplanes and the FAA... You would have to recuse yourself.
[01:47:00.930 --> 01:47:01.691]  Exactly right.
[01:47:02.251 --> 01:47:09.214]  And so why isn't it the case with this when we are affecting the lives of our future leaders in this nation?
[01:47:09.969 --> 01:47:12.732]  The only answer that I can come with are two answers.
[01:47:12.852 --> 01:47:15.655]  One is the dumbing down aspect that you talk about a lot.
[01:47:16.036 --> 01:47:18.879]  And number two is just frankly just the money that's at risk.
[01:47:19.754 --> 01:47:31.840]  And, you know, this order that we've always talked about, it now is reaching way beyond just the borders of the United States in the medical profession, into the World Trade Organization.
[01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:40.024]  We're tied into it through all of our trade acts, NAFTA and CAFTA, and the World Health Organization, and all these god-awful things.
[01:47:40.584 --> 01:47:41.925]  And sooner or later,
[01:47:42.549 --> 01:47:54.265]  You and I and a cadre of other freedom fighters are going to let it be known to people in a way that they can understand and embrace and act on that this has to stop.
[01:47:55.326 --> 01:47:57.730]  And it will stop because we're going to make it stop.
[01:48:00.438 --> 01:48:08.525]  Well, we have to, and I think people should get Generation RX, your film, and have viewing parties, show it to their neighbors.
[01:48:09.445 --> 01:48:11.367]  We have to start getting in people's business.
[01:48:11.387 --> 01:48:16.671]  I mean, they're taking our kids and turning them into tattletales to spy on us and saying that's kosher.
[01:48:17.819 --> 01:48:23.180]  It's normal for us to go talk to our neighbors, talk to our friends, talk to our families.
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:27.101]  When I'm in an airport or a grocery store now, believe me, I'm selfish.
[01:48:27.261 --> 01:48:28.821]  I just want to get on my airplane.
[01:48:29.301 --> 01:48:30.702]  I just want to get my food and go.
[01:48:31.462 --> 01:48:42.124]  But I will walk over and say, hey, listen, I don't want to get in your business, but I really care about, you know, humanity, or I really care about your child's health.
[01:48:43.089 --> 01:48:48.954]  They're trying to push dozens and dozens of new vaccines every year and these have all been proven to be causing a problem.
[01:48:49.354 --> 01:48:53.437]  Just do research before you vaccinate your children and you don't have to take the vaccines.
[01:48:54.198 --> 01:48:56.480]  And a lot of times I'll say thank you and start walking away.
[01:48:57.893 --> 01:49:00.514]  And they will say, because it's almost like they're thankful.
[01:49:00.554 --> 01:49:02.855]  They can't believe another human is talking to them.
[01:49:02.875 --> 01:49:04.135]  We've all been trained to not talk.
[01:49:04.515 --> 01:49:06.036]  And they'll say, it's not the law.
[01:49:06.056 --> 01:49:09.597]  I didn't want to give her or him the shots, but they said I had to.
[01:49:09.617 --> 01:49:10.797]  And I'll say, no.
[01:49:11.437 --> 01:49:11.957]  Google.
[01:49:11.977 --> 01:49:13.018]  I go, do you have a search engine?
[01:49:13.058 --> 01:49:13.298]  Yes.
[01:49:14.478 --> 01:49:15.138]  You have a computer?
[01:49:15.178 --> 01:49:15.418]  Yes.
[01:49:15.658 --> 01:49:21.700]  Well, search engine, you know, the term vaccine waiver form, and then your state.
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:23.681]  And you've just got to give them that form.
[01:49:24.710 --> 01:49:25.831]  And they go, thank you.
[01:49:26.472 --> 01:49:31.476]  Or other times they go, hmm, and are kind of the type that are uptight and scared and don't want to talk.
[01:49:31.536 --> 01:49:32.457]  I don't care though.
[01:49:32.857 --> 01:49:41.545]  I'm ready to do whatever it takes to go 110% to warn people because I see these little kids and I know what they're putting in the vaccines.
[01:49:41.665 --> 01:49:43.066]  I know it's a eugenics program.
[01:49:43.387 --> 01:49:45.349]  No matter how horrible it sounds, I know the truth.
[01:49:45.409 --> 01:49:47.470]  It's hard for me to admit what their own documents say.
[01:49:48.351 --> 01:49:49.832]  And I know what the drugging is about.
[01:49:49.932 --> 01:49:53.195]  I've seen them at the state level in Texas say it's eugenics.
[01:49:53.615 --> 01:49:55.037]  These children are subhuman.
[01:49:55.057 --> 01:49:59.260]  And I've talked to these psychiatrists and psychologists.
[01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:00.981]  They are on power trips.
[01:50:01.022 --> 01:50:03.283]  They are flaming evil.
[01:50:03.423 --> 01:50:06.006]  I mean, they are bastard scum.
[01:50:06.346 --> 01:50:08.748]  I'm not saying all of them, but the establishment ones.
[01:50:09.690 --> 01:50:13.173]  These certainly aren't your Carl Young or somebody like that who are pretty neat, you know.
[01:50:13.193 --> 01:50:16.136]  It's just these corporate scum.
[01:50:16.156 --> 01:50:17.438]  They're these corporate scum.
[01:50:17.698 --> 01:50:21.602]  They're to sling rock, sling dope, sling this stuff at our kids.
[01:50:21.962 --> 01:50:24.044]  And I'm tired of these 21st century dope pushers.
[01:50:24.084 --> 01:50:24.444]  Go ahead.
[01:50:25.125 --> 01:50:31.972]  Well, Alex, what I was going to say is, you know, the basis of what, when you talk about Young and some of the others, what was their foundation?
[01:50:32.072 --> 01:50:33.133]  It was talk therapy.
[01:50:33.866 --> 01:50:49.561]  I mean, if we removed all of the drugs, the psychiatric meds that we're giving kids right now, and simply just sat down and talked to them, or had a quote, expert talk to them, 98% of them would be doing infinitely better than they are on these meds.
[01:50:50.083 --> 01:51:02.669]  So when you're talking about, you know, going back to these immunosuppressant drugs that they're giving kids as vaccinations, I mean, even again, to draw the parallel, when I was a kid, we got what?
[01:51:02.849 --> 01:51:06.270]  You know, measles, the mumps, the rubella, polio.
[01:51:06.590 --> 01:51:07.371]  That was about it.
[01:51:07.431 --> 01:51:08.311]  Maybe chickenpox.
[01:51:08.891 --> 01:51:16.995]  Now they're on up to 51, 52 immunosuppressant vaccinations by the time they are eight years old.
[01:51:18.379 --> 01:51:24.481]  I mean, how in God's name can anyone believe that this is beneficial to their immune system?
[01:51:25.181 --> 01:51:27.562]  It's a sad, sad reality.
[01:51:28.162 --> 01:51:46.928]  Not to mention, then, on top of it, that the very criminals that are contaminating vaccines, like the Baxter International people, which, you know, I was talking about a long time ago, and I know you have been on this show, you know, that could have infected hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, and could have killed
[01:51:47.308 --> 01:51:48.589]  Literally millions of people.
[01:51:48.949 --> 01:51:53.712]  They're the same people that are making the vaccinations for swine flu.
[01:51:54.412 --> 01:52:15.004]  So, you know, again, I tried to produce the film in such a way so that people who had no investment in this Alex whatsoever, knew nothing about the issue, could watch Generation Rx and come to a logical conclusion themselves about whether or not they felt that this was a sane course to take.
[01:52:15.724 --> 01:52:20.508]  And I try to respect the intelligence of the people who are viewing the film.
[01:52:20.829 --> 01:52:22.150]  Well, you've done a masterpiece.
[01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:25.032]  You've made a masterpiece in Generation RX.
[01:52:25.292 --> 01:52:39.764]  I just hope that people will start caring about their fellow humans and start going to the PTA clubs, start going to the school board meetings, start going to city council and say, stop pushing drugs in the schools.
[01:52:39.884 --> 01:52:41.065]  I was a straight-A student.
[01:52:42.714 --> 01:52:46.577]  I wasn't straight A my first few years in high school, but we moved down here to Austin.
[01:52:46.617 --> 01:52:59.949]  I was straight A, made a hundred in some of my classes that last year to where I didn't need to be at school all day to finish my course load in high school.
[01:53:00.490 --> 01:53:04.293]  So for an hour a day, they said, you are a student aid.
[01:53:05.954 --> 01:53:08.337]  And I was a student aid there.
[01:53:09.702 --> 01:53:12.023]  And one day I didn't feel good.
[01:53:12.463 --> 01:53:18.125]  One day I was coming down with a cold and I went into the nurse and I said, I want to go home.
[01:53:18.865 --> 01:53:20.786]  And she said, you have to call your mommy.
[01:53:21.566 --> 01:53:23.046]  And here I am 18 years old.
[01:53:23.527 --> 01:53:25.307]  So I sit there and give the phone to my mom.
[01:53:25.347 --> 01:53:25.527]  Okay.
[01:53:25.547 --> 01:53:28.508]  You can come home for a while and got in my car and drove home.
[01:53:28.868 --> 01:53:30.589]  And then she goes, Hey, if you're feeling bad,
[01:53:31.730 --> 01:53:32.470]  It's like drugs.
[01:53:32.530 --> 01:53:33.351]  It's like speed.
[01:53:33.371 --> 01:53:34.191]  It gets you high.
[01:53:34.251 --> 01:53:34.791]  It's fun.
[01:53:35.251 --> 01:53:36.972]  Well, first I said, well, no, I don't want any riddles.
[01:53:36.992 --> 01:53:38.313]  She said, here's the name of a psychologist.
[01:53:38.713 --> 01:53:43.255]  I was real calm at the time, handsome, good-looking, clean-cut, wearing a polo shirt and slacks.
[01:53:43.755 --> 01:53:47.376]  People thought I was a cop at the school at Anderson because I didn't really hang out with anybody.
[01:53:47.416 --> 01:53:48.097]  I kept to myself.
[01:53:48.137 --> 01:53:49.257]  I just wanted to get out of high school.
[01:53:50.097 --> 01:53:53.819]  And I said, no, no, I don't need that.
[01:53:53.859 --> 01:53:54.659]  She said, oh, it's fun.
[01:53:54.699 --> 01:53:55.439]  It's like drugs.
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:57.040]  You like speed, don't you?
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:58.521]  And I'm like, look at me, lady.
[01:53:59.451 --> 01:54:00.052]  I'm a jock.
[01:54:00.132 --> 01:54:01.533]  You know, I've got like 2% body fat.
[01:54:01.573 --> 01:54:04.136]  I didn't say that, but I didn't want it.
[01:54:05.017 --> 01:54:07.260]  And then she kind of came on to me sexually.
[01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:08.401]  That was a little added thing.
[01:54:08.441 --> 01:54:12.085]  But I mean, the issue is, is that they're laughing.
[01:54:12.125 --> 01:54:12.605]  It's true.
[01:54:13.186 --> 01:54:14.748]  I mean, this country's screwed, man.
[01:54:15.448 --> 01:54:18.452]  She came at me, Mr. Miller, as a drug pusher.
[01:54:20.171 --> 01:54:31.640]  Well, and you know, one of the stories in the film that seems to expose this kind of attitude is what happened to Matthew Milling Downing and her daughter.
[01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:38.946]  You know, I mentioned about a half hour ago about Thomas Laughran, the head of the psychopharmacology division at FDA.
[01:54:40.127 --> 01:54:46.893]  Tom Laughran, his daughters were friends with Matthew Milling Downing's
[01:54:47.748 --> 01:54:48.388]  Two daughters.
[01:54:48.869 --> 01:54:51.370]  They lived in suburban DC.
[01:54:51.410 --> 01:54:52.631]  They lived in the Maryland area.
[01:54:52.651 --> 01:54:55.433]  Of course, the FDA headquarters is right near there.
[01:54:55.953 --> 01:54:57.334]  Their kids had sleepovers.
[01:54:57.834 --> 01:54:58.895]  They socialized.
[01:54:59.455 --> 01:55:00.216]  All the rest of it.
[01:55:00.756 --> 01:55:07.741]  All of this time, Thomas Loughran knew the effects of Zoloft and these SSRIs.
[01:55:09.255 --> 01:55:19.437]  And refused to interact with his good friends, who, by the way, he knew that the daughter was the one daughter was just put on Zoloft, the drug that he had approved for children.
[01:55:20.117 --> 01:55:23.338]  And he never even said anything to the Downings.
[01:55:24.278 --> 01:55:31.680]  And the end result was, a few months later, that this beautiful, beautiful 11-year-old girl, Candace Downing,
[01:55:32.534 --> 01:55:34.896]  So how do we get to this place where you have such a disconnect?
[01:55:34.916 --> 01:55:45.824]  These people who are running the show in DC and who are living off of our tax dollars and are so inhumane that they won't share the most basic
[01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:05.466]  Warning information with friends that they've been friends with for 9 or 10 or 11 years.
[01:56:05.687 --> 01:56:13.276]  But that's the issue with these fake corporate types is they're into how they don't care about anybody and they'd watch you drown to not even help.
[01:56:13.736 --> 01:56:16.500]  They're in to the fact that their soul is scum.
[01:56:17.639 --> 01:56:30.133]  Well, I'll tell you, I think you're exactly right, because I've watched dozens and dozens and dozens of hours of FDA hearings, and I see nothing but cold and calculation coming from all of the FDA officials.
[01:56:30.173 --> 01:56:34.478]  They could give a damn about the stories of real people who died on these beds.
[01:56:35.011 --> 01:56:41.018]  Well, that's because the overarching geopolitical system is run by eugenicists, so the more of us they kill, the better.
[01:56:41.799 --> 01:56:45.323]  I mean, that's... I mean, in the state hearings, they said that.
[01:56:45.403 --> 01:56:49.888]  They said, these people are subhuman, they have bad gene pools, we're getting rid of them.
[01:56:53.846 --> 01:56:57.911]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.
[01:56:58.371 --> 01:57:01.334]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved.

[01:57:53.092 --> 01:57:55.193]  A new world order.
[01:57:55.914 --> 01:58:00.677]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:58:00.797 --> 01:58:02.559]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:03.619 --> 01:58:05.781]  Both their objective being world domination.
[01:58:06.397 --> 01:58:08.819]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:15.446]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:58:19.929 --> 01:58:24.892]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:58:25.373 --> 01:58:28.835]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:58:29.235 --> 01:58:31.717]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:58:31.817 --> 01:58:32.958]  Most people have no idea.
[01:58:32.978 --> 01:58:33.718]  They're not after money.
[01:58:33.738 --> 01:58:34.839]  They have all the money they need.
[01:58:35.039 --> 01:58:35.760]  They're after power.
[01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:36.880]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:59:42.445 --> 01:59:45.307]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.607 --> 02:00:11.833]  When good people stop caring and stop being involved in society, bad things happen.
[02:00:12.794 --> 02:00:16.499]  And they've got around 20% of our kids on drugs today, they want to put 50% on.
[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:20.203]  Generation RX, a film by Kevin P. Miller.
[02:00:20.283 --> 02:00:24.848]  I'm going to have it back up the next month or two, maybe even play some clips here at Prison Planet.
[02:00:25.842 --> 02:00:26.503]  Dot TV.
[02:00:26.563 --> 02:00:28.865]  But this is just very well done.
[02:00:28.885 --> 02:00:35.251]  It'll warn people when the school's pushing the drugs on their kids that it is proven to cause suicide.
[02:00:35.271 --> 02:00:36.813]  They even have to put that on the drugs now.
[02:00:37.253 --> 02:00:38.835]  Thanks to people like Mr. Miller's actions.
[02:00:39.235 --> 02:00:42.779]  Get the film at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.

[02:00:49.125 --> 02:01:00.391]  You can also write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704 to get Generation RX, a film by Kevin P. Miller.
[02:01:00.852 --> 02:01:02.933]  Kevin, we've got about four minutes left here at the end.
[02:01:04.045 --> 02:01:08.809]  Tell folks more about the film because, I mean, it's so multifaceted.
[02:01:09.289 --> 02:01:10.850]  It gets into so many areas.
[02:01:11.210 --> 02:01:15.313]  It shows the motivation, the lies, what the drugs do, the horror stories.
[02:01:16.454 --> 02:01:17.175]  It's just amazing.
[02:01:17.215 --> 02:01:22.479]  Tell folks more about Generation RX and how they can use it to stop this mass murder.
[02:01:23.007 --> 02:01:43.702]  Well I appreciate the latter part of what you just said because what I've said often in my speeches around the country is that I made the film so that parents in particular and teachers and even sheriffs could be armed with the information they need and especially parents because you know how intimidated
[02:01:44.242 --> 02:01:52.648]  Most parents are, either by a school administrator or certainly a doctor, were intimidated by the lab coat and their air of authority.
[02:01:53.168 --> 02:02:04.997]  And yet, you know, it's incredible because since the film has been out, I was speaking in Nebraska a couple of weeks ago and a woman came up to me and she said, you know, I actually did what you suggested.
[02:02:05.097 --> 02:02:07.819]  I used the information as a weapon.
[02:02:07.839 --> 02:02:09.360]  And I said, really?
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:09.780]  With whom?
[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:12.222]  She said, with my child's pediatrician.
[02:02:13.121 --> 02:02:17.285]  And, uh, and evidently the pediatrician was just sort of dumbstruck.
[02:02:17.646 --> 02:02:22.831]  Had no response for the vast majority of the statistics or things that she cited from the film.
[02:02:23.291 --> 02:02:29.157]  So, you know, I took great care to make sure that there was integrity in the information, Alex, and you know how important that is.
[02:02:29.558 --> 02:02:34.703]  Because if there isn't integrity in the information, it makes it too easy for everybody else to shoot down.
[02:02:35.223 --> 02:02:45.987]  So I would encourage people to buy it through you and to use the information in the film, first of all, as a weapon to defend their child and defend their communities.
[02:02:46.447 --> 02:02:50.849]  And in the case of sheriffs, if you get a call from the local school,
[02:02:51.983 --> 02:03:01.906]  And you find out there's a, you know, gun standoff, you might have some insight that no other sheriff in the country has on why this is going down.
[02:03:02.606 --> 02:03:03.866]  So that's part of it.
[02:03:04.286 --> 02:03:06.667]  So, I mean, the film is pretty diverse.
[02:03:06.747 --> 02:03:10.388]  I mean, the first part of it is really an overview to the entire
[02:03:10.928 --> 02:03:13.449]  Mad situation that we've gotten ourselves into.
[02:03:13.469 --> 02:03:18.932]  The second part in particular, folks, is really clearly on ADHD.
[02:03:19.372 --> 02:03:21.033]  The shoddy science behind it.
[02:03:21.053 --> 02:03:31.638]  Some really sort of comical... They take boys, I mean all species of mammal, from seals to dogs to cats, jump around and fight and play, and they say normal behavior is abnormal.
[02:03:31.898 --> 02:03:34.779]  Then they put kids on caffeine and sugar, they're bouncing off the walls.
[02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:37.801]  They claim crashing from sugar is bipolar.
[02:03:38.161 --> 02:03:39.602]  Your film is just amazing.
[02:03:40.242 --> 02:03:52.730]  Generation Rx, I want to have you up in a month or so for two hours to take horror story calls from the listeners and people to tell more of your stories and maybe have some of the families on that are in Generation Rx.
[02:03:52.830 --> 02:03:55.672]  Available, folks, at InfoWars.com.
[02:03:56.092 --> 02:03:58.214]  Get it today on the online video bookstore.
[02:03:58.914 --> 02:04:02.877]  Kevin Miller, thank you for the great work you've done and we'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[02:04:03.673 --> 02:04:04.653]  It's been my pleasure, Alex.
[02:04:04.733 --> 02:04:05.514]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:05.774 --> 02:04:06.014]  You bet.
[02:04:06.034 --> 02:04:06.874]  Keep up the great work.
[02:04:06.914 --> 02:04:09.435]  And we'll have him back up in the next month or so for two hours.
[02:04:09.915 --> 02:04:13.397]  And talk about some of the other films he's working on as well.
[02:04:13.417 --> 02:04:14.957]  And some of the other films he's done.
[02:04:15.678 --> 02:04:16.858]  That's it for this transmission.
[02:04:16.918 --> 02:04:18.379]  Great job to the crew.
[02:04:18.819 --> 02:04:20.660]  Retransmission starts now in one place.
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:24.181]  InfoWars.com on the audio screens and AM and FM stations across the country.
[02:04:24.261 --> 02:04:25.121]  Retransmit us as well.
[02:04:25.702 --> 02:04:27.862]  I want to thank Genesis and all the sponsors too.
[02:04:28.083 --> 02:04:28.483]  Stay with us.
[02:04:28.503 --> 02:04:29.043]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:32.819 --> 02:04:34.660]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:04:36.082 --> 02:04:38.403]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:04:41.085 --> 02:04:46.630]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[02:04:46.930 --> 02:04:48.091]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:04:48.231 --> 02:04:52.194]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around called Inner Food.
[02:04:52.514 --> 02:05:00.660]  My wife just loves the stuff and now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[02:05:01.801 --> 02:05:04.362]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[02:05:04.662 --> 02:05:06.163]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[02:05:06.403 --> 02:05:09.184]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[02:05:09.424 --> 02:05:10.865]  And their formula really works.
[02:05:11.125 --> 02:05:13.686]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[02:05:13.946 --> 02:05:15.207]  Try the NutriCafe.
