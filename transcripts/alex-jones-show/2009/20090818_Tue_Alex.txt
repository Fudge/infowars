[00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:05.790]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.151]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.453 --> 00:00:16.094]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:17.814]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:19.635]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:21.096]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:23.376]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:27.078]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.598 --> 00:00:29.959]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[00:00:30.854 --> 00:00:31.674]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:40.917]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are live for the third and fourth hour today.
[00:00:43.438 --> 00:00:48.139]  And we are going to be taking phone calls later.
[00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.560]  We have text bars popping in in the next hour to talk about all these news headlines.
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.061]  Voodoo in the White House!
[00:00:54.963 --> 00:01:01.006]  Just search engine that term and you can read the different stories about another headline is witchcraft in the White House.
[00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:05.328]  We're going over this because
[00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:09.430]  The establishment is on a witch hunt against Christians.
[00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.694]  They admit all over the country they CPS homeschoolers, Christian families, children, the neighbors are on a witch hunt.
[00:01:16.194 --> 00:01:18.435]  I'm not on a witch hunt against the real witches.
[00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:24.758]  I just want to point out that most the world leaders we've researched on record are into the occult.
[00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:27.820]  Just search engine, Sherry Blair.
[00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:35.336]  Which, Tony Blair is possessed by a spirit every morning, he believes, and flops around on the ground.
[00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:38.078]  That's mainstream British news, he admits it.
[00:01:38.358 --> 00:01:41.121]  He is so overtaken with the spirit of the light.
[00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:45.564]  As he calls it, be a Lucifer, the light bearer.
[00:01:45.584 --> 00:01:47.585]  I can't make this stuff up.
[00:01:47.605 --> 00:01:49.487]  We're going to show you some of those articles later.
[00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:58.334]  And then meanwhile, you got Obama's wife's mommy doing the santeria, the chickens, you know, running around, chickens with their heads cut off.
[00:01:58.354 --> 00:01:59.715]  This is all part of the new freedom.
[00:02:00.155 --> 00:02:01.617]  And when they said change, they meant it.
[00:02:02.617 --> 00:02:04.539]  But actually, this isn't really change, is it?
[00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:06.621]  Because we're going to cover that next hour.
[00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:11.945]  The occult is the norm in circles of power, not the exception.
[00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.553]  So that is coming up today.
[00:02:18.034 --> 00:02:23.338]  I want to spend a few segments now getting into the fact that we are going into revolution.
[00:02:23.798 --> 00:02:28.822]  The signs, the evidence is now overwhelming and even blowing me away how fast, how real, how huge it is.
[00:02:30.043 --> 00:02:35.368]  But that also confirms to me that the establishment is going to counter-strike.
[00:02:36.445 --> 00:02:38.846]  And it's gonna try to stage some crises.
[00:02:39.567 --> 00:02:40.907]  And then we'll take your phone calls.
[00:02:41.107 --> 00:02:42.508]  Dave, Brad, many others holding.
[00:02:42.788 --> 00:02:44.669]  The toll free number to join us today is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:44.769]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.890]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.131]  But I wanted to go over
[00:03:00.632 --> 00:03:10.286]  all the articles we have and and this is without looking this is just like i said on the sunday show in the last few days hundreds and hundreds of articles are out there and and and we've printed
[00:03:12.174 --> 00:03:13.075]  2030, I didn't count.
[00:03:13.115 --> 00:03:14.156]  Big stacks of these.
[00:03:14.737 --> 00:03:31.134]  AP, AFP, German newspapers, British newspapers, London Telegraph, Sunday Mail, Financial Times of London, Moscow Times, Tokyo newspapers, about how the flu shot is killing people.
[00:03:32.472 --> 00:03:41.836]  The flu shot trials in the United States, mainly in Texas, are killing people, and the federal government is saying, keep this secret, don't let the public know about it.
[00:03:42.256 --> 00:03:44.397]  Now there's so many different angles to that.
[00:03:44.917 --> 00:03:55.101]  Not just that it's killing people, but that they would keep it quiet, and that every other time they do this it kills a bunch of people, and that they're clearly testing a soft kill operation saying, we'll be bold.
[00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:59.523]  We'll just give people shots out in the open that kill them and maim them and hurt them.
[00:04:00.023 --> 00:04:04.187]  I mean, they've already brain damaged millions of children, always at 18 months.
[00:04:04.227 --> 00:04:05.749]  The child gets the third round of shots.
[00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.791]  They're running around, giggling, talking, laughing.
[00:04:08.511 --> 00:04:09.412]  Then they sit in the corner.
[00:04:09.432 --> 00:04:11.334]  I mean, I'm sad.
[00:04:11.354 --> 00:04:12.055]  It's very sad.
[00:04:12.075 --> 00:04:19.242]  For the rest of their life, just, ooh, ooh, from the brain damage, because the brain swells with the adjuvants and other things that are in it, not just the mercury.
[00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.892]  And that's your chemical lobotomy.
[00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:28.636]  Now, most people are only meant to be brain damaged by this, so you're kind of a drone.
[00:04:29.457 --> 00:04:36.142]  It's kind of like the movie Black Hole, where they're lobotomizing people to serve the crazy scientist.
[00:04:36.182 --> 00:04:38.424]  Well, that's really what they're doing here.
[00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:42.926]  Thirty years ago, you didn't see any autistic children.
[00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:45.607]  Now, some high schools, a third of them are.
[00:04:45.627 --> 00:04:46.287]  Whole range.
[00:04:46.447 --> 00:04:48.508]  And they're just, the operation's going well.
[00:04:48.908 --> 00:04:58.212]  Now they're gonna soft kill you with autoimmune disease and other things, and people will just be everywhere dying in mass, and the news will say it's good, and everyone will love it, and roll their sleeves up and say, I'm ready!
[00:04:58.552 --> 00:05:00.433]  I'm ready to lose 20 IQ points!
[00:05:00.893 --> 00:05:05.475]  I'm ready to have my organs shot down, I'm ready to have convulsions, I'm ready to be paralyzed!
[00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:06.956]  Give me the shot, right here!
[00:05:06.976 --> 00:05:08.676]  It's gonna be one hell of a ride!
[00:05:08.696 --> 00:05:09.537]  Ha ha!
[00:05:10.575 --> 00:05:11.676]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:13.738]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:14.559]  Well, you should.
[00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:19.184]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:05:19.424 --> 00:05:19.904]  That's right.
[00:05:20.225 --> 00:05:28.693]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:05:28.893 --> 00:05:30.155]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:05:30.255 --> 00:05:31.396]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:05:31.596 --> 00:05:37.220]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:44.105]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:05:44.466 --> 00:05:49.670]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.131]  This is real.
[00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:52.192]  Don't miss out.
[00:05:52.512 --> 00:05:59.377]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[00:06:11.206 --> 00:06:13.808]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:06:14.228 --> 00:06:19.192]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:06:19.553 --> 00:06:21.294]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:26.438]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:06:26.598 --> 00:06:27.539]  How much do you want?
[00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:28.520]  When do you want it?
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.501]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:06:30.782 --> 00:06:31.602]  When will you need it?
[00:06:31.862 --> 00:06:33.924]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:06:34.064 --> 00:06:35.165]  Will there be any food?
[00:06:35.405 --> 00:06:36.726]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:06:36.927 --> 00:06:41.991]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:06:42.191 --> 00:06:45.374]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:06:45.774 --> 00:06:49.237]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:06:49.577 --> 00:06:50.578]  How much will you need?
[00:06:50.818 --> 00:06:51.438]  We don't know.
[00:06:51.718 --> 00:06:52.619]  How much do you want?
[00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:53.559]  All you can get.
[00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:54.600]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.601]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:06:57.901 --> 00:07:00.522]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:00.743 --> 00:07:01.543]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:07:10.137 --> 00:07:15.324]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:07:15.444 --> 00:07:19.810]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.833]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:07:22.253 --> 00:07:23.615]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:07:23.875 --> 00:07:24.917]  There is a solution.
[00:07:25.137 --> 00:07:33.160]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:40.623]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[00:07:47.046 --> 00:07:52.648]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:07:53.068 --> 00:07:56.869]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[00:07:57.229 --> 00:08:03.411]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[00:08:04.672 --> 00:08:08.013]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[00:08:12.535 --> 00:08:18.558]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:19.158 --> 00:08:22.199]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:29.922 --> 00:08:36.165]  Okay, we're sound broadcasting now at PrisonPlanet.tv and Living Color, and on screen we'll put a few of these articles, but
[00:08:39.232 --> 00:08:41.093]  It's not just the flu shot.
[00:08:41.714 --> 00:08:52.701]  Don't forget the Associated Press from two days ago that says polio surge in Nigeria after vaccine virus mutates.
[00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.672]  So we've got that going on.
[00:09:11.727 --> 00:09:22.418]  And I think about how it killed so many people in the 1976 swine flu outbreak, which started at a military base after they vaccinated troops.
[00:09:24.039 --> 00:09:28.603]  So after they vaccinate troops, all of this happens.
[00:09:32.888 --> 00:09:33.028]  And
[00:09:35.959 --> 00:09:44.264]  It's just, it's so obvious what they're doing and they've been caught, the United Nations has been caught over and over again adding hormones to vaccines to sterilize people.
[00:09:46.024 --> 00:09:48.986]  They've been caught over and over again carrying these type of things out.
[00:09:54.369 --> 00:10:02.774]  And then of course you have this article from the Mail Online, from the Sunday Mail, also the one in Telegraph, BBC, only a few papers in the U.S.
[00:10:02.794 --> 00:10:03.574]  reported on this.
[00:10:04.154 --> 00:10:04.815]  That's a whole other
[00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:06.471]  facet of this.
[00:10:06.691 --> 00:10:10.472]  Shouldn't this be top news everywhere?
[00:10:10.492 --> 00:10:30.277]  That they knowingly are covering up the fact the flu shot is killing large numbers of people that it's tested on because of Gillian-Bernay syndrome, which is an autoimmune response basically in the brain and the brain shuts down and people stop breathing.
[00:10:31.587 --> 00:10:35.772]  And there's a whole bunch of brain disorders proven to be caused by vaccines.
[00:10:36.152 --> 00:10:39.316]  Swine flu jab link to killer nerve disease.
[00:10:40.497 --> 00:10:46.444]  Leaked letters reveals concern of neurologists over 25 deaths in America just in the test.
[00:10:47.144 --> 00:10:51.489]  A warning of the new swine flu jab is likely to be a deadly nerve disease.
[00:10:52.654 --> 00:10:57.936]  And has been linked to it, has been sent by the government to senior neurologist in a confidential letter.
[00:10:57.957 --> 00:10:58.897]  Let me read that again.
[00:10:58.957 --> 00:11:07.521]  A warning that the new swine flu jab is linked to a deadly nerve disease has been sent by the government to senior neurologist in a confidential letter.
[00:11:08.121 --> 00:11:15.605]  The letter from the Health Protection Agency, the official body that oversees public health, has been linked to the mail on Sunday.
[00:11:15.965 --> 00:11:16.785]  Has been leaked to them.
[00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:30.460]  Leading to demands to know why the information has not been given to the public before the vaccination of millions of people, including children, begins.
[00:11:31.982 --> 00:11:42.114]  Again, the letter, this is so important, I'm reading it twice, the letter from the Health Protection Agency, the official body that oversees the public health, has been leaked to the Mail on Sunday
[00:11:43.345 --> 00:11:51.927]  Leading to demands to know why the information has not been given to the public before the vaccination of millions of people, including children, begins.
[00:11:52.967 --> 00:12:04.169]  And they're trying to now condition the public that it's the law in Germany, in England, in the United States, in Canada, in Australia, all over the Western world, that you must take the shots.
[00:12:04.729 --> 00:12:07.009]  And it's being run by the World Health Organization.
[00:12:07.049 --> 00:12:08.189]  They picked the vaccine.
[00:12:08.229 --> 00:12:09.270]  They direct its use.
[00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:10.870]  They declared level six.
[00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:18.875]  The same UN that's been caught sterilizing people and putting HIV and vaccines and polio and vaccines on record.
[00:12:19.135 --> 00:12:25.259]  They were caught again last year and UN programs giving people polio shots are killing people again.
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.301]  You get the shot, you die from it.
[00:12:28.052 --> 00:12:28.693]  From polio.
[00:12:29.433 --> 00:12:33.076]  And the AP goes, well, you still need it even though it might kill you.
[00:12:33.757 --> 00:12:35.318]  And yeah, it's an accident.
[00:12:35.819 --> 00:12:38.020]  Yeah, Hitler accidentally had a mustache.
[00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:40.462]  Hitler accidentally wore black uniforms.
[00:12:40.823 --> 00:12:42.504]  Hitler accidentally was a Nazi.
[00:12:42.844 --> 00:12:44.246]  Birds accidentally fly.
[00:12:45.186 --> 00:12:46.568]  Ducks accidentally quack.
[00:12:47.148 --> 00:12:53.053]  I mean, I'm just sick of how they just calmly report, oh yeah, you know, over and over.
[00:12:53.213 --> 00:12:55.035]  I see this every few months, we're different.
[00:12:56.028 --> 00:12:56.308]  U.N.
[00:12:56.348 --> 00:12:59.189]  programs in Latin America, Asia, Africa, Europe.
[00:12:59.849 --> 00:13:01.130]  Give people the polio.
[00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:02.811]  Give people HIV.
[00:13:03.091 --> 00:13:04.491]  Give people bird flu.
[00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:06.092]  Give people Ebola.
[00:13:07.112 --> 00:13:09.713]  The Gardasil's killing masses of people.
[00:13:10.073 --> 00:13:11.554]  And it's like, yeah, it kills you.
[00:13:12.154 --> 00:13:14.955]  But usually you only have convulsions and get paralyzed.
[00:13:15.175 --> 00:13:17.556]  The women are like, good, I want my daughter to have it.
[00:13:19.977 --> 00:13:21.657]  We ought to pull up a Gardasil ad.
[00:13:22.678 --> 00:13:24.058]  My daughter's one less.
[00:13:24.098 --> 00:13:25.419]  Yeah, one less that's living.
[00:13:28.647 --> 00:13:39.892]  Now there's Irish health, there's the Irish newspaper, swine flu vaccine warning to neurologists, but you won't see this in our newspapers because we're the brain damaged people that take whatever they're told.
[00:13:39.912 --> 00:13:42.874]  I mean, that's why the public, folks, when you're, look, I'm convinced.
[00:13:43.888 --> 00:13:46.009]  In the last 10 years, people are more brain damaged.
[00:13:46.289 --> 00:13:49.311]  I mean, I talk to adults now, and they can barely tie their shoes.
[00:13:49.631 --> 00:13:50.812]  They can't stay on task.
[00:13:51.752 --> 00:13:59.116]  I mean, is it that they're watching TV all day, or is it the government document how they want to sterilize us and dumb us down with chemicals in the water and vaccines?
[00:13:59.736 --> 00:14:00.417]  Eco-science.
[00:14:00.477 --> 00:14:01.117]  No, they're doing it.
[00:14:01.957 --> 00:14:03.178]  I mean, look at everybody!
[00:14:04.579 --> 00:14:05.900]  Look what they've done to us!
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.861]  And the public's going to go out and get it.
[00:14:09.441 --> 00:14:12.143]  That's why you've got people who are 25 years old with Alzheimer's now.
[00:14:14.946 --> 00:14:22.808]  I mean, almost everybody I know that takes flu shots who's above 50 can't even hardly talk, they just kind of... I mean, literally, what?
[00:14:22.828 --> 00:14:24.368]  This is incredible!
[00:14:24.908 --> 00:14:27.389]  But they don't advertise it's dangerous so people don't know.
[00:14:27.689 --> 00:14:29.730]  Yeah, my neighbor's 40, he's got cancer.
[00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.430]  The kid down the street's 9, he's dying of cancer.
[00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.211]  Yeah, my daughter's got cancer.
[00:14:35.571 --> 00:14:41.232]  Here in my office, we have multiple people whose girlfriends and family members who are 21, 25, 30 years old are dying of cancer.
[00:14:45.054 --> 00:14:47.615]  I mean, it's just the way things are now, you know?
[00:14:49.495 --> 00:14:54.736]  Pretty soon the kids will say, Mommy, is it true kids didn't used to live in wheelchairs and have to be on drugs?
[00:14:55.096 --> 00:14:56.877]  No, that's a conspiracy theory, honey.
[00:14:57.997 --> 00:15:02.138]  Everyone's always been in a wheelchair and taking 14 injections a day and taking all these pills.
[00:15:03.398 --> 00:15:03.798]  THX1138.
[00:15:04.098 --> 00:15:06.619]  Everyone's always had injectors strapped onto their arms.
[00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:08.679]  In fact, where's that London Guardian?
[00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:10.780]  I kept meaning to get to that, and Rob Dew came in with it.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.240]  Here's the London Guardian.
[00:15:14.085 --> 00:15:18.927]  And I have the Wall Street Journal saying it's a mental illness to want to purify your water.
[00:15:19.847 --> 00:15:27.390]  Now folks, isn't that creepy when the establishment's telling you it's mentally ill to eat healthy and drink clean water?
[00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.491]  These people mean business, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:30.751 --> 00:15:32.172]  They mean real business.
[00:15:32.892 --> 00:15:35.573]  It's now mentally ill if you don't want to eat GMO.
[00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:38.390]  You're now mentally ill.
[00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.952]  I'll put it down here so you can get a screenshot for folks with a document cam.
[00:15:42.772 --> 00:15:46.574]  Healthy food obsession sparks rise in new eating disorder.
[00:15:47.054 --> 00:15:51.017]  You know, I've been eating a lot healthier the last six months and lost 37 pounds.
[00:15:54.238 --> 00:15:57.700]  Other than breaking out, something I hadn't done since I was a teenager, it's been great.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.421]  All these toxins come out of me.
[00:15:59.441 --> 00:16:02.183]  I feel like I'm 18 again or something.
[00:16:04.329 --> 00:16:05.349]  I feel great though, so.
[00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:09.750]  It says, healthy food obsession sparks rise in new eating disorder.
[00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:16.031]  I'm mentally ill, because last night I just had an organic cheese sandwich and a salad.
[00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:18.812]  I'm mentally ill.
[00:16:27.513 --> 00:16:31.054]  They now have orthorexia.
[00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:33.711]  See, that's the new disease.
[00:16:33.771 --> 00:16:36.953]  If you want to eat healthy, you need to be put on drugs.
[00:16:36.973 --> 00:16:39.375]  You're mentally ill if you want to eat salads.
[00:16:40.716 --> 00:16:44.018]  They have all these new diseases where if you believe in a world government, you're mentally ill.
[00:16:45.819 --> 00:16:53.525]  Sufferers like to focus on righteous eating and have rigid rules about avoiding certain foods.
[00:16:54.445 --> 00:16:57.868]  Oh my gosh, they are bad people.
[00:17:00.165 --> 00:17:08.127]  Don't worry though, the priest class of the control freaks, they've got some deadly fluoride-based pills that actually eat holes in your brains.
[00:17:08.467 --> 00:17:10.288]  You eat this, you won't worry about nothing!
[00:17:11.428 --> 00:17:12.968]  Just take some pills!
[00:17:13.448 --> 00:17:19.370]  Are you like all the kids on Prozac and Ritalin with the brain shrinkage, the heart swelling, the heart palpitations, all the deaths?
[00:17:20.584 --> 00:17:21.204]  Absolutely.
[00:17:21.244 --> 00:17:22.745]  Read all those deadly chemicals.
[00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:25.867]  Read the insert about all the things it does to you.
[00:17:25.907 --> 00:17:28.989]  And then, you're normal though if you want to eat those pills.
[00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:33.652]  But if you want to eat a salad, man, you're, you're, whoa dude, you're rad!
[00:17:34.192 --> 00:17:35.173]  You're radical!
[00:17:36.133 --> 00:17:40.215]  Oh, man, dude, I know a dude that only eats organic food, man!
[00:17:40.615 --> 00:17:42.236]  He's, like, really dangerous!
[00:17:42.576 --> 00:17:43.716]  God, he's radical!
[00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:46.197]  You need to put him in the funny farm, yeah!
[00:17:46.657 --> 00:17:50.319]  He doesn't like eating GMO salmon with cockroach and human genes!
[00:17:50.979 --> 00:17:51.459]  Yeah!
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.660]  Yeah, man, he's weird!
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.081]  Dude, dude, dude, he's weird!
[00:17:56.325 --> 00:18:01.772]  They advertise all over the country with beef you can get delivered to your house and it says grass-fed beef.
[00:18:01.852 --> 00:18:03.133]  It's so weird.
[00:18:03.474 --> 00:18:05.396]  The media does pieces about how that's weird.
[00:18:05.836 --> 00:18:07.599]  Cows eating grass!
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.762]  Man, that's radical too, dude!
[00:18:11.463 --> 00:18:18.504]  What's normal is grinding up the dead cows and dead dogs and dead farm animals, but also your dog dies at the vet.
[00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:23.025]  You didn't know they sell it to a facility that's ground into dog food and other animal food?
[00:18:23.405 --> 00:18:28.106]  And they mix them all in, in these awful slurries is what they're called.
[00:18:28.126 --> 00:18:30.446]  That's what the term awful means, just the guts out of an animal.
[00:18:30.846 --> 00:18:33.447]  And they grind it all up and they feed that to cows.
[00:18:33.867 --> 00:18:38.528]  Then they wonder why the cows get mad cow and start growing crystals in their tissue.
[00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:49.744]  In their bones and in muscle that's anywhere near the spinal cord or other central bone structures.
[00:18:50.525 --> 00:18:56.187]  See, oh, there's weirdos who say we shouldn't feed rotten animals to cows.
[00:18:56.207 --> 00:18:57.787]  They're so radical.
[00:18:57.807 --> 00:19:00.568]  I mean, these people are dangerous.
[00:19:00.608 --> 00:19:02.689]  Of course cows are only supposed to eat meat.
[00:19:03.928 --> 00:19:04.991]  Rotten meat at that.
[00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:08.520]  Man, I'm glad I'm not one of these people that thinks you should eat healthy.
[00:19:08.601 --> 00:19:12.230]  I mean, and I'm glad I'm not one of these people that, uh...
[00:19:14.895 --> 00:19:16.295]  Oh, it's just so radical.
[00:19:16.575 --> 00:19:31.739]  See, the elite know there's revolution against them, because they got humanity so far down the line of accepting dehumanization and poison and vaccines and cancer viruses and all the things they do, that finally we got people to wake up from the trance.
[00:19:32.079 --> 00:19:38.780]  And more and more are waking up, and as other people wake up from the trance, it's accelerating, so they're coming out and using all the peer pressure they can.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.221]  It's mentally ill to not want world government!
[00:19:41.741 --> 00:19:43.602]  It's mentally ill to not eat GMO food.
[00:19:43.622 --> 00:19:45.724]  It's mentally ill to drink filtered water.
[00:19:45.944 --> 00:19:46.584]  Don't do it!
[00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:49.166]  And people are going, I don't believe a word you say.
[00:19:49.526 --> 00:19:53.969]  And then they're reading, wait, you mean the flu shot's killing people that take it?
[00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.792]  You mean the government knew this and is doing it again?
[00:19:57.812 --> 00:19:58.692]  That's in the articles.
[00:19:59.273 --> 00:20:02.295]  You mean the government's putting polio in the polio shots?
[00:20:02.875 --> 00:20:07.378]  You mean the White House science czar said they wanted to do this decades ago and now they are?
[00:20:08.239 --> 00:20:09.600]  See, people are waking up.
[00:20:10.968 --> 00:20:15.998]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[00:20:16.118 --> 00:20:21.568]  With so many places to choose from, deciding where and what to buy can be a lengthy, frustrating process.
[00:20:21.768 --> 00:20:22.790]  The answer is simple.
[00:20:25.603 --> 00:20:26.004]  I think so.
[00:20:41.926 --> 00:20:42.286]  I think so.
[00:21:11.434 --> 00:21:13.376]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:21:13.636 --> 00:21:16.278]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:21:16.578 --> 00:21:24.885]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:21:25.185 --> 00:21:28.027]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:21:28.848 --> 00:21:32.070]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:21:33.392 --> 00:21:34.993]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:21:35.373 --> 00:21:36.274]  Take action now!
[00:21:36.434 --> 00:21:40.056]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:21:41.237 --> 00:21:44.979]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:21:45.219 --> 00:21:48.421]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:21:48.541 --> 00:21:54.985]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[00:21:55.265 --> 00:22:00.789]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:03.331]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[00:22:03.572 --> 00:22:08.776]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:22:09.116 --> 00:22:12.338]  It is a big idea.
[00:22:12.358 --> 00:22:14.460]  A new world order.
[00:22:15.201 --> 00:22:19.624]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:22:23.416 --> 00:22:28.119]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:36.185]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:22:39.201 --> 00:22:44.164]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:22:44.645 --> 00:22:48.127]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:22:48.507 --> 00:22:51.009]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:22:51.089 --> 00:22:52.050]  Most people have no idea.
[00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.010]  They're not after money.
[00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:54.111]  They have all the money they need.
[00:22:54.311 --> 00:22:55.032]  They're after power.
[00:22:55.292 --> 00:22:56.132]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.021]  You have been warned.
[00:23:10.502 --> 00:23:15.967]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:23:16.007 --> 00:23:16.548]  and the world.
[00:23:16.808 --> 00:23:20.272]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.

[00:23:27.178 --> 00:23:28.960]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:34.445]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[00:23:34.645 --> 00:23:34.905]  I think so.

[00:23:58.907 --> 00:24:00.669]  Tex Mars is coming up in the next hour.
[00:24:00.749 --> 00:24:01.610]  Dr. Russell Blaylock.
[00:24:21.468 --> 00:24:23.929]  He is with us now for the next 35 minutes or so.
[00:24:23.949 --> 00:24:27.770]  We'll get him back up in the next few weeks for a full hour or two to take phone calls.
[00:24:28.991 --> 00:24:42.475]  He is a board-certified neurosurgeon, author and lecturer, attended LSU School of Medicine in New Orleans, and completed his general surgery internship and neurosurgical residency at the Medical University of South Carolina at Charleston, South Carolina.
[00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:45.396]  And he ran the neurosurgery program there.
[00:24:45.576 --> 00:24:47.056]  He is the inventor of some of the most
[00:24:48.959 --> 00:24:52.421]  Famous, modern forms of brain surgery.
[00:24:52.481 --> 00:24:53.522]  It's a very long bio.
[00:24:53.562 --> 00:24:56.303]  He's a top brain surgeon and neurologist.
[00:24:57.003 --> 00:25:00.025]  So not just in brain surgery, but also overall brain science.
[00:25:00.345 --> 00:25:01.826]  He's with us for the next 35 minutes.
[00:25:02.967 --> 00:25:07.489]  Doctor, you got on the line before we went to break and you were laughing during the break, saying, yeah, that's right.
[00:25:10.481 --> 00:25:13.382]  Don't filter your water and don't eat organic food.
[00:25:13.402 --> 00:25:16.764]  They're now, not just in the London Guardian, but all over U.S.
[00:25:16.784 --> 00:25:25.448]  television saying it's mentally ill to not want to take your vaccines, to want to eat clean food, to want to filter your water.
[00:25:26.028 --> 00:25:28.289]  I mean, this is really getting crazy, Doctor.
[00:25:29.369 --> 00:25:33.891]  Well, they're obsessed with people, you know, avoiding these toxins.
[00:25:34.231 --> 00:25:39.474]  If the science on the toxicity of fluoridation of water is just extensive, even the
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:51.667]  The National Academy of Sciences has completed a huge study, which confirmed everything we've been saying in the research literature about toxicity of fluoride.
[00:25:52.248 --> 00:26:03.135]  And I wrote a paper along with Chuck LaSavakia, a scientist, which is a comprehensive review of the toxicity of fluoride that collects all the research done on it.
[00:26:03.615 --> 00:26:07.138]  So this, you know, the research is so extensive.
[00:26:08.787 --> 00:26:16.353]  It's ridiculous that we're still adding fluoride to water, plus the fact that they admit that it has nothing to do with reducing cavities.
[00:26:17.254 --> 00:26:23.579]  Even the American Fentanyl Association had to admit that drinking fluoride in water does not reduce cavities one bit.
[00:26:24.239 --> 00:26:25.140]  But they're still doing it.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.802]  Well, you have to ask, why are you doing it then?
[00:26:29.023 --> 00:26:31.785]  So that leaves it open to a lot of interpretation of why they're doing it.
[00:26:31.805 --> 00:26:33.046]  Same thing with organic food.
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:43.267]  What they did is test the protein content and a few other contents of food and compared them and said, well, they're so real different.
[00:26:43.848 --> 00:26:47.490]  What they didn't test was the most important part of the plant, that's the flavonoids.
[00:26:48.491 --> 00:26:52.314]  There's a significant difference in the two, and in the difference in toxicity.
[00:26:53.584 --> 00:27:02.126]  So they didn't test the ring structures, the trace minerals, the cofactors, they didn't test the GMO alterations that are in the GMO.
[00:27:02.546 --> 00:27:04.187]  All of this is left out.
[00:27:04.867 --> 00:27:08.508]  And of course this is the way modern political science is done.
[00:27:09.348 --> 00:27:22.772]  If you work for government, if you work for institutes that are promoting a program, they just manipulate the science, release it to the press, the press regurgitates it, and then all the true scientists out there are saying it's a bunch of baloney.
[00:27:23.554 --> 00:27:24.715]  They never get interviewed.
[00:27:25.435 --> 00:27:29.357]  Their material will never appear before the public eye.
[00:27:29.658 --> 00:27:32.139]  Same thing with the vaccine.
[00:27:32.839 --> 00:27:36.381]  What we know about vaccines is so frightening that the public knew it.
[00:27:37.302 --> 00:27:40.604]  I don't think anyone would submit their child to be injected with these things.
[00:27:41.064 --> 00:27:46.007]  Well yes sir, this is a short segment and I want to come back in the next and just sit back and have you go over
[00:27:47.134 --> 00:27:53.900]  They keep accidentally, in quotes, putting live polio in the shots that are killing people all over the world.
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:28:04.410]  They keep, in quotes, accidentally, they say, oh yeah, the 76 and now this new flu, as you know, vaccine, is killing people with degenerative nerve diseases.
[00:28:05.151 --> 00:28:09.074]  And there's a whole family of those, which, for the listeners, so you can speak on that.
[00:28:09.415 --> 00:28:10.235]  But just briefly,
[00:28:11.096 --> 00:28:12.717]  I'm not on some elite high horse.
[00:28:12.797 --> 00:28:18.101]  I don't think of myself, Dr. Blaylock, as a brain surgeon like yourself, BlaylockReport.com.
[00:28:18.621 --> 00:28:20.723]  You know the old pun, he's as smart as a brain surgeon.
[00:28:21.323 --> 00:28:22.504]  I just have a good memory.
[00:28:23.305 --> 00:28:31.771]  And talking to the public, people around me, I went to a water park this weekend, the public looks like they've been poisoned.
[00:28:31.831 --> 00:28:34.873]  Kind of like if you look at cows and say, those cows don't look healthy.
[00:28:36.394 --> 00:28:43.938]  They look drugged out, they act mentally retarded, and more is it watching the TV?
[00:28:44.618 --> 00:29:03.528]  We know the studies show that a lot of TV watching can even lower the brainwaves over time, retard people's development, kind of put them into a zombie state, but you're the expert on this, but just as a medical doctor and observing people practicing for what, 30 years, have you noticed that it seems like people are becoming mentally retarded?
[00:29:04.537 --> 00:29:16.206]  Well, what I have noticed, which I remarked to my office staff, I said, I can't believe the number of young people that are coming in to me saying they're having trouble with their memory.
[00:29:17.527 --> 00:29:23.491]  I said, you know, when I was growing up, I never heard a complaint that you had trouble with your memory.
[00:29:23.551 --> 00:29:28.675]  You know, when you were young, you could remember everybody's phone number, everybody's name.
[00:29:28.735 --> 00:29:30.977]  I could remember where every book in my library was.
[00:29:31.137 --> 00:29:32.738]  I could turn to any page.
[00:29:33.827 --> 00:29:40.573]  But more and more people are having difficulty with memory and cognitive functions that are very young.
[00:29:41.834 --> 00:29:44.156]  And so, yes, something is going on.
[00:29:45.057 --> 00:29:48.419]  And I think it's, you know, environmental influences.
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:50.681]  Environmental influences.
[00:29:50.701 --> 00:29:51.042]  Stay there.
[00:29:51.062 --> 00:29:51.962]  I want to talk more about that.
[00:29:51.982 --> 00:29:55.005]  Dr. Russell Blaylock, BlaylockReport.com.
[00:29:55.385 --> 00:29:58.648]  We really are thankful to have him, this eminent scientist on with us.
[00:30:01.593 --> 00:30:02.475]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.976 --> 00:30:04.579]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.599 --> 00:30:08.206]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.694 --> 00:30:14.658]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:30:14.938 --> 00:30:16.700]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:25.208]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:30:25.449 --> 00:30:30.674]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:30:31.014 --> 00:30:32.636]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:30:32.856 --> 00:30:39.181]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:30:39.381 --> 00:30:50.128]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:30:50.429 --> 00:30:50.889]  That's right.
[00:30:51.189 --> 00:30:53.492]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:30:53.752 --> 00:30:55.494]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[00:30:55.574 --> 00:30:55.814]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:30:55.875 --> 00:30:58.177]  Or visit A Cola Blue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:30:58.397 --> 00:30:59.158]  That's A Cola Blue dot com.
[00:31:10.555 --> 00:31:11.656]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:31:11.937 --> 00:31:13.738]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:31:13.939 --> 00:31:14.579]  Well, you should.
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:19.164]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:31:19.405 --> 00:31:19.905]  That's right.
[00:31:20.226 --> 00:31:28.675]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:31:28.875 --> 00:31:30.136]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:31:30.237 --> 00:31:31.378]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:31:31.578 --> 00:31:37.202]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:31:37.563 --> 00:31:44.088]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:31:44.448 --> 00:31:49.672]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:31:49.993 --> 00:31:51.113]  This is real.
[00:31:51.434 --> 00:31:52.174]  Don't miss out.
[00:31:52.494 --> 00:31:59.360]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:05.548]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:32:16.764 --> 00:32:19.765]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:20.005 --> 00:32:20.225]  Number 2.
[00:32:20.685 --> 00:32:25.586]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:25.887 --> 00:32:26.347]  It's true.
[00:32:26.547 --> 00:32:30.748]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:30.968 --> 00:32:31.468]  Number 3.
[00:32:31.888 --> 00:32:37.330]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.730]  Number 4.
[00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:40.831]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:32:41.071 --> 00:32:44.472]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:44.732 --> 00:32:44.952]  Number 5.
[00:32:45.572 --> 00:32:49.213]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:32:49.433 --> 00:32:54.935]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:32:55.175 --> 00:32:59.716]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:33:15.512 --> 00:33:20.894]  Okay, Dr. Russell Blaylock, brain surgeon, neuroscience expert, joining us right now.
[00:33:38.146 --> 00:33:43.591]  We were getting into, if people knew how deadly vaccines were, they would never take them.
[00:33:44.012 --> 00:33:45.693]  It does seem that's starting to come out.
[00:33:46.094 --> 00:33:57.625]  I'm sure, because I've seen you writing on it, for years you've talked about all these degenerative diseases of the brain associated with different things in the vaccines.
[00:33:58.586 --> 00:34:01.349]  Not just the one that's making headlines right now.
[00:34:03.339 --> 00:34:06.461]  That they're talking about, but a whole group of these.
[00:34:07.162 --> 00:34:13.506]  But for listeners that just now joined us, one of the headlines is, Swine Flu Jab Link to Killer Nerve Disease.
[00:34:14.227 --> 00:34:23.854]  Leaked letter reveals concerns of neurologists over 25 deaths in America just in the trials and how to keep this secret from the public.
[00:34:23.894 --> 00:34:32.100]  And then I have a whole other big stack, top virologist, a whole bunch of top brain scientists,
[00:34:33.331 --> 00:34:40.196]  Neurosurgeons are saying the same thing in Bild, the biggest newspaper in Germany.
[00:34:40.596 --> 00:34:43.738]  They're saying it has live cancer viruses in it.
[00:34:44.339 --> 00:34:47.921]  I mean, this is just wild stuff, but I want you to get into that, doctor.
[00:34:47.941 --> 00:34:50.203]  But first, finishing up, the break cut you off.
[00:34:51.835 --> 00:34:56.878]  Is the sluggishness the additives, the vaccines, the chemicals in the water?
[00:34:56.978 --> 00:34:58.399]  Is it a cocktail of those?
[00:34:58.779 --> 00:35:00.521]  Because, yeah, I guess retarded isn't the word.
[00:35:00.541 --> 00:35:04.163]  It's more of a sluggishness, almost a glazed over.
[00:35:04.483 --> 00:35:07.645]  Or is it a mix of watching four and a half hours of TV a day?
[00:35:07.905 --> 00:35:09.726]  We're a very passive population.
[00:35:10.067 --> 00:35:10.887]  I mean, what is it?
[00:35:10.927 --> 00:35:12.508]  Because I look at old black and white photos.
[00:35:12.528 --> 00:35:15.710]  I look at old family Super 8 video or
[00:35:17.071 --> 00:35:20.552]  You know, video or film shot 20, 30, 40 years ago in my family.
[00:35:20.772 --> 00:35:21.493]  They're alive.
[00:35:21.513 --> 00:35:23.433]  They look awake.
[00:35:23.493 --> 00:35:25.014]  I mean, it's not nostalgia.
[00:35:25.374 --> 00:35:27.235]  Something real is going on there.
[00:35:27.675 --> 00:35:31.036]  What is taking the spark out of people from your research?
[00:35:31.796 --> 00:35:40.139]  Well, I think if we look at it, and a lot of scientists are beginning to agree with this, is the number of environmental assaults on people.
[00:35:40.199 --> 00:35:45.301]  Things like fluoride in water, the heavy use of pesticides and herbicides,
[00:35:45.785 --> 00:35:47.105]  That's all in the atmosphere.
[00:35:47.125 --> 00:35:51.726]  You know, they study people, look at their fat content of these chemicals.
[00:35:51.766 --> 00:35:59.927]  They find something like 80 to 110 different organic chemicals from industry, pesticides and herbicides in their tissues.
[00:36:01.868 --> 00:36:06.709]  All of the vaccinations, we give 40, 50, 60 vaccines.
[00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:12.550]  By the time a child enters college, they're just being vaccinated to death.
[00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:14.550]  Well, I'd be rather intense
[00:36:15.549 --> 00:36:31.276]  Research in the literature, collecting all that's known from our research in the neuroscience of vaccination and what it does, well there's just compelling evidence that these vaccines, the way they're being given, is producing a state of chronic brain inflammation.
[00:36:32.096 --> 00:36:44.121]  And that when your brain is chronically inflamed, it produces depression, it produces disorientation, confusion, difficulty thinking clearly, clouded thinking in your mind, fatigue,
[00:36:45.571 --> 00:36:53.236]  Abnormal behavior, even violent behavior, criminal behavior, suicide, addictions, the list just goes on and on.
[00:36:53.296 --> 00:36:56.838]  And this is all well demonstrated in the scientific literature.
[00:36:57.398 --> 00:37:07.005]  The problem is it's never discussed because of the pressure and the power of those that are promoting these vaccines in our children.
[00:37:07.025 --> 00:37:12.008]  For instance, the average child is getting 36 vaccines by the time they start school.
[00:37:12.594 --> 00:37:17.496]  That is an enormous assault on the brain by this vaccine.
[00:37:17.576 --> 00:37:32.664]  And the process by which they do it, that is, spacing them every two months and giving five and six and seven vaccines at each office visit, produces an enormous activation of the brain's immune system in a prolonged way.
[00:37:33.224 --> 00:37:41.188]  And each segment of that vaccination process produces a real hyper-intense brain inflammation.
[00:37:41.621 --> 00:37:49.466]  That is, some children produce autism, some ADHD, some have seizures, some have other neurological dysfunctions.
[00:37:50.126 --> 00:37:57.290]  Well, this whole flu vaccine thing, they're planning on doing three serial vaccines within 21 days.
[00:37:58.731 --> 00:38:08.577]  Well, if you look at the neuroscience of that, that produces a rather significant prolonged brain inflammation, particularly with the adjuvant they're going to use.
[00:38:09.284 --> 00:38:22.008]  In fact, some of the best evidence was when they guinea pigged a few years ago the anthrax shots to see what would happen with the troops in different levels and it killed quite a few of them.
[00:38:35.526 --> 00:38:41.970]  Well, it caused a 200% increase in ALS, Lou Gehrig's Disease, which is a fatal disorder.
[00:38:43.851 --> 00:38:45.111]  So they finally admitted that.
[00:38:45.171 --> 00:38:47.052]  It took a long time to get them admitted.
[00:38:47.473 --> 00:38:55.637]  Several, I remember a Lieutenant Colonel testified before Congress, and he was in the middle stages of ALS and eventually died.
[00:38:57.258 --> 00:39:04.442]  It took a lot of pressure before they admitted, yes, the vaccine caused these soldiers to die from this horrible disease.
[00:39:05.496 --> 00:39:07.897]  Well, it's not the only disease that's neurological.
[00:39:07.977 --> 00:39:11.738]  There's Guillain-Barre Ascending Paralysis that you talked about.
[00:39:12.178 --> 00:39:24.782]  Well, in 1976, there were over 500 reported cases, but there were probably 10 or 100 times a greater number of cases that were never reported, because it's not a reportable disease.
[00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:26.102]  You don't have to report it.
[00:39:27.383 --> 00:39:31.364]  They had three elderly people died in one vaccination center in one day.
[00:39:32.314 --> 00:39:33.675]  After receiving the vaccine.
[00:39:34.235 --> 00:39:36.696]  And they're doing the same thing now they did back then.
[00:39:36.736 --> 00:39:37.817]  It's the bait and switch.
[00:39:38.337 --> 00:39:43.299]  They tested one vaccine and then gave millions of people a different vaccine.
[00:39:43.819 --> 00:39:46.540]  That's exactly what they admit they're planning to do now.
[00:39:47.181 --> 00:39:51.903]  I have in Nature Magazine an interview with the head of the U.S.
[00:39:52.003 --> 00:39:56.525]  Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci, of ACI.
[00:39:57.225 --> 00:39:59.146]  And they asked him a series of questions.
[00:39:59.426 --> 00:39:59.886]  One was,
[00:40:00.481 --> 00:40:02.601]  What are you going to do to test this vaccine?
[00:40:02.621 --> 00:40:04.802]  They said, well, we have five tests.
[00:40:05.842 --> 00:40:09.142]  And they said, well, are you going to put the adjuvant in the vaccine to test it?
[00:40:09.222 --> 00:40:09.883]  He said, no.
[00:40:10.363 --> 00:40:15.043]  We're going to test it without the adjuvant on children and pregnant women and other people.
[00:40:16.344 --> 00:40:22.725]  And then he said, well, are you going to use the adjuvanted vaccine when you actually give it to people?
[00:40:22.925 --> 00:40:23.565]  He said, yeah.
[00:40:24.325 --> 00:40:28.726]  So they're testing one vaccine and it's going to give a different vaccine.
[00:40:28.946 --> 00:40:29.866]  It's the adjuvant.
[00:40:30.373 --> 00:40:36.657]  The powerful immune stimulant that produces most of the complications that are associated with vaccination.
[00:40:37.177 --> 00:40:41.759]  And the next question, he said, are you going to test adjuvants in children?
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:49.464]  And he said, and I quote, I don't think anybody has really good data on adjuvants in children.
[00:40:50.984 --> 00:40:59.029]  And decisions that we will not give it, give the adjuvated flu vaccine to kids, we don't have time to collect substantial data.
[00:40:59.522 --> 00:41:06.241]  Now it works during the test, but when the vaccine comes out, the children will get a vaccine with adjuvant in it.
[00:41:06.878 --> 00:41:25.412]  Now, Dr. Blaylock, just to interrupt you, talking to yourself and other scientists, other medical doctors, other brain surgeons and neurologists, more and more we're realizing that, yes, mercury and aluminum are bad, do build up, do cause problems when it's directly put in the bloodstream.
[00:41:26.052 --> 00:41:30.675]  Different from eating fish and it goes through you and is bound to the other things in the food.
[00:41:34.298 --> 00:41:34.900]  Leaves the body.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.744]  Again, I'm not here being a doctor.
[00:41:36.764 --> 00:41:38.128]  I'm just going off what doctors have said.
[00:41:38.749 --> 00:41:41.636]  Do you agree with a lot of literature coming out that
[00:41:42.814 --> 00:42:05.382]  Mercury overall is somewhat of a red herring, that it's really the autoimmune inflammation, not just in the brain, but even in other organs that's being associated with burning out the pancreas, attacking the liver, attacking the stomach walls, the intestinal walls, the brain, I mean, just basically the whole body.
[00:42:06.523 --> 00:42:12.325]  Well, you know, all of this has been proven, and we know that Mercury, even in infinitesimally small doses,
[00:42:13.194 --> 00:42:20.657]  Powerfully increases brain inflammation, activates the brain's immune system, which is destructive of brain connection.
[00:42:20.757 --> 00:42:23.258]  Oh, so mercury is the adjuvant.
[00:42:23.298 --> 00:42:25.880]  Okay, so I always thought that mercury was the preservative.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:26.220]  Okay.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:30.702]  Well, it is the preservative, but it also produces a high influence of autoimmunity.
[00:42:30.722 --> 00:42:35.744]  See, they never mention that mercury does this, but they talk about it.
[00:42:36.224 --> 00:42:38.125]  But it's well demonstrated.
[00:42:38.145 --> 00:42:39.085]  There's no question.
[00:42:39.265 --> 00:42:40.346]  I mean, it's accepted.
[00:42:40.922 --> 00:42:46.643]  That in infinitesimally small doses it produces significant brain disruption.
[00:42:47.143 --> 00:42:49.684]  It collects in the brain and stays there a lifetime.
[00:42:50.364 --> 00:42:57.106]  For instance, a child in the past was given 36 vaccines, most of which contained mercury.
[00:42:57.746 --> 00:43:01.367]  Each one of those doses accumulated in the brain for a lifetime.
[00:43:01.847 --> 00:43:07.008]  Plus whatever they ate, whatever they breathed in the air, whatever was in their food was added to it.
[00:43:07.991 --> 00:43:09.473]  Uh, this was totally ignored.
[00:43:09.873 --> 00:43:17.682]  All of this stuff you hear about, well, we proved that vaccines, uh, mercury has no relation to these, is an absolute lie and they know it.
[00:43:18.443 --> 00:43:20.225]  Uh, it's in the scientific literature.
[00:43:20.305 --> 00:43:21.026]  I write about it.
[00:43:21.046 --> 00:43:22.988]  It's in my articles on my website.
[00:43:23.769 --> 00:43:25.931]  Uh, I've published a number of articles on this.
[00:43:26.572 --> 00:43:28.173]  Uh, all the references are there.
[00:43:28.193 --> 00:43:29.535]  So they know it.
[00:43:30.483 --> 00:43:31.604]  They know all of these things.
[00:43:32.445 --> 00:43:44.434]  Well Doctor, let me ask you a layman's question and then go in other directions about this upcoming shot and what this Gillian Bernays is compared to the ALS and the other things you were talking about.
[00:43:44.454 --> 00:43:55.422]  And all these new neurodegenerative diseases that I guess give the brain doctors a lot of work but is really being generated by this and other environmental factors that you were discussing.
[00:43:56.443 --> 00:44:10.771]  When you've engaged in brain surgeries, when you've done slides of tissue or biopsies, I've seen, this is the layman in medical journals, the incredible heavy metal plaques, the other plaques that are involved.
[00:44:11.631 --> 00:44:22.456]  Can you ever even, say, in an older person's brain that's had a large diet of heavy metals or worked in toxic factories or had a lot of shots, can you even see that in slides with the naked eye?
[00:44:22.857 --> 00:44:26.758]  Or what does it look like under a magnifying glass or under a microscope?
[00:44:27.699 --> 00:44:31.721]  Well, you don't see the metals directly, but you see the results of the metals.
[00:44:32.421 --> 00:44:36.263]  And, of course, they carefully measure these metal contents in the different
[00:44:37.192 --> 00:44:47.517]  There's a significant elevation of mercury in the parts of the brain affected in Alzheimer's patients.
[00:44:47.598 --> 00:44:52.940]  They also have higher blood mercury levels than the population without the disorder.
[00:44:54.001 --> 00:44:57.222]  So most of these things have been carefully confirmed and measured.
[00:44:57.523 --> 00:44:59.824]  The aluminum content of the brain has been measured.
[00:45:00.484 --> 00:45:04.086]  And what aluminum does in the brain has been demonstrated quite
[00:45:05.285 --> 00:45:08.886]  Yes, you can see the pathology in the brain produced by this.
[00:45:09.086 --> 00:45:19.168]  In fact, they even radio-labeled the aluminum in vaccines and traced it going from the site of the injection of the muscle into the brain.
[00:45:19.708 --> 00:45:23.089]  So we know that the aluminum from the vaccine ends up in the brain.
[00:45:24.169 --> 00:45:25.449]  So you can't argue about that.
[00:45:25.509 --> 00:45:33.871]  That's in the pump med medical journals and quite well demonstrated.
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:38.641]  So the evidence is there in just enormous amounts.
[00:45:39.202 --> 00:45:42.543]  It's just being ignored in the media in a state of confusion.
[00:45:43.043 --> 00:45:49.285]  They're listening to the people who are selling this stuff and they won't listen to those of us who have researched it carefully.
[00:45:51.085 --> 00:46:01.649]  Now about your neurological diseases, I will wager if they do what they're planning on doing, you will see tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of cases
[00:46:02.193 --> 00:46:02.593]  Okay.
[00:46:26.363 --> 00:46:27.764]  That's the beginning of his answer.
[00:46:27.964 --> 00:46:29.204]  We don't know what it'll do.
[00:46:29.305 --> 00:46:33.747]  We don't know what happens when you combine vaccines with different viruses in it.
[00:46:34.407 --> 00:46:35.768]  Well, the virologists know.
[00:46:36.328 --> 00:46:39.510]  The viruses start exchanging their genetics.
[00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:41.291]  They develop hybrids.
[00:46:41.331 --> 00:46:43.672]  They develop new viruses.
[00:46:44.152 --> 00:46:45.453]  They produce new diseases.
[00:46:45.473 --> 00:46:47.594]  So he's lying.
[00:46:48.374 --> 00:46:50.956]  And all of this nonsense, well, oh, you know, the big
[00:46:52.103 --> 00:46:53.124]  A scare is coming.
[00:46:53.184 --> 00:46:55.205]  Of course, there's not many people dead in the world.
[00:46:55.225 --> 00:46:56.787]  It's been a pretty mild flu.
[00:46:57.707 --> 00:47:02.010]  They asked him, well, if the virus is mutating, what good will the vaccine do?
[00:47:02.731 --> 00:47:07.414]  And he says, oh, we've been checking the molecular and genetic makeup of these viruses all over the world.
[00:47:07.895 --> 00:47:09.776]  It has not changed one bit.
[00:47:10.437 --> 00:47:11.557]  That is a complete lie.
[00:47:11.578 --> 00:47:18.983]  I mean, it's all over the news that a month ago, in one week, there were five new mutations at one lab just in Houston.
[00:47:19.764 --> 00:47:19.924]  Sir,
[00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:26.272]  Clearly you went over the medical journals and the facts, Dr. Blaylock, that they know what all this is doing.
[00:47:26.632 --> 00:47:41.138]  When we look at Paul Ehrlich and John P. Holdren, both presidential advisors, one of them, the head science czar for those out there just now tuning in, they openly say sterilize people through the vaccines, sterilize them through the water.
[00:47:42.138 --> 00:47:49.201]  Other UN documents, like their biological diversity assessment, say use chemicals to brain damage the public.
[00:47:50.041 --> 00:48:01.127]  Nobel Prize winners that we've quoted and covered in my film in-game, like Bertrand Russell said, we will inject the public with heavy metals and brain damage the lower classes to be our servants.
[00:48:01.727 --> 00:48:14.154]  As a brain surgeon, as a neurologist, looking at this, knowing they're lying, knowing they know that one shot of the flu vaccine, what the reports are, three flu shots, doubles your chances of Alzheimer's in the studies,
[00:48:14.734 --> 00:48:18.836]  So if they know what they're doing then, the question is why are they doing it?
[00:48:19.036 --> 00:48:22.798]  Is this part of the larger Brave New World, Dr. Blaylock?
[00:48:23.358 --> 00:48:28.801]  Well, they're planning on giving the vaccine to 4.9 billion people worldwide.
[00:48:29.402 --> 00:48:37.426]  They have been caught in the past giving vaccines that were specifically designed to produce infertility in African women.
[00:48:38.206 --> 00:48:40.627]  The women caught on wouldn't take the vaccine.
[00:48:40.667 --> 00:48:42.008]  They tested the vaccine.
[00:48:42.603 --> 00:48:50.185]  And found out they had put antitrophoblastic antigen in it with a specific goal of producing infertility.
[00:48:50.285 --> 00:48:54.627]  So, they have been caught using a tetanus vaccine.
[00:48:54.907 --> 00:48:58.968]  They also used it in Central America to do that one thing.
[00:48:59.048 --> 00:49:01.869]  It produced infertility for population control.
[00:49:02.469 --> 00:49:09.851]  If you read the literature going back all the way to 1910, this has been an obsession with the Rockefeller-Carnegie group.
[00:49:10.473 --> 00:49:14.636]  It's control of population growth and to reduce the population of the world.
[00:49:16.177 --> 00:49:21.781]  Who was the great funder of molecular science throughout history and all the way up to the present day?
[00:49:21.801 --> 00:49:26.584]  It's the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, and now the Ford Foundation.
[00:49:27.105 --> 00:49:37.071]  So you have major foundations worth hundreds of billions of dollars that have been pouring their money into the science with that goal in mind.
[00:49:37.091 --> 00:49:37.972]  They're eugenicists.
[00:49:38.695 --> 00:49:51.644]  And as I said in one of your other programs, if you read Lily Kay's book on the history of molecular science, she specifically says that was always their goal, social engineering and control of population.
[00:49:52.225 --> 00:50:01.151]  So I'm not surprised that they would use the vaccine on 4.9 billion people worldwide with that goal in mind.
[00:50:01.889 --> 00:50:02.670]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:10.515]  It's this specific vaccine already causing deaths in the trials, with secret memorandums in the federal government to keep that secret.
[00:50:11.156 --> 00:50:20.323]  I would say this is the most suspect vaccine, because they've been caught in the past adding these sterilants and other things to the larger programs.
[00:50:20.363 --> 00:50:23.485]  That just makes sense, if you're coming from their perspective.
[00:50:24.206 --> 00:50:25.006]  Well, absolutely.
[00:50:26.067 --> 00:50:27.968]  You know, and a lot of people are catching up.
[00:50:28.068 --> 00:50:30.110]  A third of the nurses in Britain
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:32.921]  They won't take the vaccine.
[00:50:32.961 --> 00:50:35.762]  More and more people are concerned about this.
[00:50:36.102 --> 00:50:45.845]  We haven't even covered some of the major things like the contamination of cancer-causing viruses, unknown viruses, neurotrophic cell viruses.
[00:50:46.426 --> 00:50:55.909]  All of this is talked about in the closed meeting among virologists, but the general public has no clue as to the occurrence of all of this.
[00:50:57.796 --> 00:51:00.337]  Dr. Russell Blaylock, final segment with you straight ahead.
[00:51:00.357 --> 00:51:03.079]  We'll get you on for an extended interview in the next few weeks.
[00:51:03.699 --> 00:51:06.101]  This information couldn't be more important.
[00:51:11.424 --> 00:51:15.406]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[00:51:15.686 --> 00:51:18.547]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[00:51:18.948 --> 00:51:26.752]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we, the people,
[00:51:27.012 --> 00:51:28.934]  Do not diligently assert these rights.
[00:51:29.254 --> 00:51:31.195]  They may be taken away and lost forever.
[00:51:31.636 --> 00:51:38.100]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[00:51:38.441 --> 00:51:44.185]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[00:51:44.625 --> 00:51:46.886]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[00:51:47.206 --> 00:51:54.608]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market and numerous other high-quality health supplements.

[00:52:11.303 --> 00:52:16.624]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:17.325 --> 00:52:22.666]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:52:23.206 --> 00:52:29.368]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:29.748 --> 00:52:31.549]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:31.669 --> 00:52:34.071]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:45.097]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:52:47.318 --> 00:52:48.619]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:50.400]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:57.084]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:54:19.429 --> 00:54:24.092]  My film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, covers their eugenics master plan.
[00:54:24.112 --> 00:54:30.756]  You're hearing Dr. Blaylock, famous brain surgeon, researcher, neurologist, here telling you the same information.
[00:54:31.097 --> 00:54:33.358]  There is nothing more important than this info.
[00:54:33.638 --> 00:54:35.920]  We're gonna get him on for a long interview in the next two weeks.
[00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:37.721]  Really honored to have him on with us.
[00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:40.362]  The website is BlaylockReport.com.
[00:54:40.422 --> 00:54:43.384]  B-L-A-Y-L-O-C-K-Report.com.
[00:54:43.924 --> 00:54:53.450]  A lot of friends and family won't listen to you, or me, or when we give them medical reports, or when you give them German news and British news about how it's killing people and full of cancer viruses.
[00:54:54.550 --> 00:55:01.995]  But, if they see a YouTube video of this interview, or you send them one of his books or articles or materials,
[00:55:03.103 --> 00:55:05.850]  From BlaylockReport.com, you may save a life.
[00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:14.052]  You know, I was talking to a friend the other day about, he told this guy, you know, don't give your kid those shots, third round of shots, his son's brain damaged now, doesn't talk.
[00:55:14.572 --> 00:55:16.873]  This is a holocaust, it's by design.
[00:55:17.113 --> 00:55:19.413]  We got three and a half minutes left, Dr. Blaylock.
[00:55:19.853 --> 00:55:27.875]  In closing, they're talking about martial law, forced inoculations, the Governor's Association has sent a letter saying we don't want to be under D.O.D.
[00:55:27.915 --> 00:55:28.415]  control.
[00:55:28.815 --> 00:55:31.776]  They're announcing 400,000 troops to now occupy.
[00:55:31.796 --> 00:55:33.997]  That's The Hill, newspaper, N.A.P.
[00:55:35.137 --> 00:55:40.759]  And then, as you said, the cancer viruses, all the other areas, I mean, this is insane!
[00:55:40.979 --> 00:55:42.059]  Your comments on that?
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:56:01.106]  Well, yeah, I mean, according to the World Health Organization, we come under IHR 2500, which says that they have the legal right to control the response to public health emergencies in the United States of America.
[00:56:01.874 --> 00:56:13.763]  So we are a signatory to that, and therefore they have the right to carry out any measures they want, and to recommend to our government what measures need to be taken on a state level.
[00:56:13.823 --> 00:56:16.105]  Well, all the plans have been worked out, as you say.
[00:56:17.065 --> 00:56:26.052]  They're using the excuse of the troops and the response of the military as to control riots of people who want to get the vaccine.
[00:56:27.328 --> 00:56:32.011]  Which I thought was rather humorous rather than being the other way around and people who don't want to get it.
[00:56:35.213 --> 00:56:35.854]  Well said.
[00:56:39.116 --> 00:56:40.697]  What about the cancer virus angle?
[00:56:40.737 --> 00:56:41.077]  Go ahead.
[00:56:41.617 --> 00:56:53.785]  Well yeah, there's Dr. Martin who is a virologist and does a lot of research in this area and he's discovered what is stealth viruses which is now a lot of research around the world on stealth viruses.
[00:56:54.956 --> 00:56:57.978]  These are viruses that are not picked up by routine testing.
[00:56:58.378 --> 00:57:02.540]  They take very meticulous testing to demonstrate it.
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:12.845]  But these vaccines are filled with stealth viruses that can produce brain disorders decades after you've been injected, or cancer.
[00:57:13.826 --> 00:57:18.108]  There's cancer-causing viruses that are known inside of these vaccines.
[00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:21.410]  Many of these viruses aren't even tested for.
[00:57:22.210 --> 00:57:27.112]  Do you think the establishment is going to get away with this?
[00:57:27.172 --> 00:57:31.735]  I mean, as you said earlier, it looks like people everywhere are waking up.
[00:57:31.755 --> 00:57:34.136]  But these eugenicists are just so bold.
[00:57:50.034 --> 00:57:58.325]  Well, they are, but you know, with the town hall meetings, they've seen how the public can react against these things.
[00:57:58.385 --> 00:58:01.729]  And I think it'll take a reaction like that to bring this to a halt.
[00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:07.056]  Once people understand that the vaccine is the big danger, not the flu.
[00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:16.817]  Well, Congressman Brown, Congressman Paul, former Congressman Dick Armey are all saying in major newspapers that they may use this for martial law.
[00:58:17.417 --> 00:58:22.301]  So it's not just Dr. Russell Blaylock or Alex Jones or us saying this from the wilderness.
[00:58:22.341 --> 00:58:24.603]  The good news is people are waking up.
[00:58:24.663 --> 00:58:33.050]  So maybe this push to make us take shots is an attempt to really try to force us to
[00:58:34.266 --> 00:58:37.108]  Go along with what they're doing and try to put the genie back in the bottle.
[00:58:37.508 --> 00:58:38.568]  I don't think that's gonna happen.
[00:58:38.969 --> 00:58:41.750]  Dr. Blaylock, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:43.611]  It's BlaylockReport.com.
[00:58:43.911 --> 00:58:44.712]  God bless you, sir.
[00:58:45.272 --> 00:58:45.692]  Thank you.
[00:58:45.712 --> 00:58:46.192]  God bless you.
[00:58:46.713 --> 00:58:47.093]  You bet.
[00:58:47.113 --> 00:58:48.234]  We'll have him back in two weeks.
[00:58:48.694 --> 00:58:49.954]  Tex Marr, straight ahead.
[00:58:52.356 --> 00:58:54.277]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:55.918 --> 00:58:58.199]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:01.257 --> 00:59:03.860]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:59:04.281 --> 00:59:09.227]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:59:09.608 --> 00:59:11.350]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:11.651 --> 00:59:16.477]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:16.657 --> 00:59:17.618]  How much do you want?
[00:59:17.839 --> 00:59:18.580]  When do you want it?
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.541]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:20.842 --> 00:59:21.662]  When will you need it?
[00:59:21.903 --> 00:59:23.964]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:24.104 --> 00:59:25.205]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:25.446 --> 00:59:26.787]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:26.987 --> 00:59:32.051]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:32.251 --> 00:59:35.374]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:35.814 --> 00:59:39.316]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:39.636 --> 00:59:40.617]  How much will you need?
[00:59:40.857 --> 00:59:41.477]  We don't know.
[00:59:41.778 --> 00:59:42.678]  How much do you want?
[00:59:42.878 --> 00:59:43.619]  All you can get.
[00:59:43.799 --> 00:59:44.659]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:44.899 --> 00:59:47.661]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:47.941 --> 00:59:49.702]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:49.722 --> 00:59:50.643]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:00:03.664 --> 01:00:05.565]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:06.025 --> 01:00:08.826]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:31.585 --> 01:00:35.786]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:00:35.886 --> 01:00:41.008]  He is a number one national Christian bestseller.
[01:00:41.028 --> 01:00:43.469]  He's also had his books on the New York Times bestseller list.
[01:00:43.509 --> 01:00:49.871]  You know, Air Force officer, professor of space and aeronautics and military science.
[01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:52.370]  He's also a pastor.
[01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:57.471]  We carry a lot of his books and videos and materials at InfoWars.com.
[01:00:57.511 --> 01:00:59.512]  He's with us for the next 30-40 minutes or so.
[01:00:59.952 --> 01:01:04.112]  Then I'm going to finish up on a bunch of news and video clips I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:17.735]  I wanted to get Tex on on short notice and I appreciate him doing it because we've covered how Tony Blair, according to major British newspapers, is possessed by the spirit of the light.
[01:01:19.048 --> 01:01:39.867]  and falls on the ground every morning and and sherry blair is his wife that is a witch and and they go to aztec rituals different rituals and francois meter on paid to have the six hundred and sixty six pieces of gold glass at the pyramid at the louvre in paris and texas uh... has this uh...
[01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:49.933]  Big book, well he has two big books, Codex Magicka, and then he has these mysterious monuments, big textbook size books that we carry that we've covered.
[01:01:49.953 --> 01:01:51.674]  In fact, grab me one of those, I forgot to do it.
[01:01:52.174 --> 01:02:00.459]  It's just filled with politicians and sports teams, owners and bankers, admittedly building occult palaces, admittedly being into the occult.
[01:02:00.779 --> 01:02:07.583]  Ronald Reagan into the occult, wouldn't make a decision unless his astrologer said, gave speeches to the minute according to astrology.
[01:02:08.902 --> 01:02:20.585]  Hillary Clinton doing seances with Mrs. Roosevelt, having shaman, Bohemian Grove in the occultism, skull and bones in the occultism.
[01:02:21.932 --> 01:02:38.196]  It just comes out, Obama and all these weird shaman charms in his pocket, and then it comes out, witchcraft in the White House Town Hall, with sources and documents and books coming out about it, and then we have an article voodoo in the White House that goes into more detail.
[01:02:38.216 --> 01:02:40.297]  We're about to go to break, but I wanted to go to Tex right now.
[01:02:40.817 --> 01:02:45.758]  Tex, I mean, everybody's freaking out about this, but isn't this par for the course?
[01:02:46.536 --> 01:02:48.297]  Hey Alex, great to be with you again.
[01:02:48.497 --> 01:02:50.038]  Yes, it is porn for the course.
[01:02:50.538 --> 01:03:01.925]  Of course, during the Clinton White House, you mentioned Hillary Rodham Clinton, who went on top of the roof and actually invoked the spirits of the sky to come in to the White House.
[01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:07.928]  She was up there with a New Age shaman witch named Jean Houston.
[01:03:09.212 --> 01:03:20.718]  Who was her guru, and you know, Hillary also spoke by her own admission to both the spirit of Mohammed Gandhi and to Eleanor Roosevelt.
[01:03:21.038 --> 01:03:28.302]  But now, the Obamas, it's very hard to find direct connection with Barack.
[01:03:28.842 --> 01:03:35.966]  His wife has a little bit of this from her mother, but I'll tell you, I just finished a new video about Obama myself.
[01:03:36.943 --> 01:03:37.183]  And I
[01:03:56.038 --> 01:04:13.517]  Supposedly an anti-war group, but it turns out it's really a witchcraft, a Wicca group that's a big supporter of Obama, and in fact they actually held a witchcraft ritual to cleanse the White House
[01:04:14.344 --> 01:04:18.966]  Of bad spirits and omens on the last day of George Bush in office.
[01:04:18.986 --> 01:04:32.734]  So, you know, when you use witches to have a ritual to cleanse the White House, well, I wonder who they actually invited in to the White House.
[01:04:33.274 --> 01:04:42.278]  But that was Code Pink, a very interesting group that is known supposedly for
[01:04:43.609 --> 01:04:53.078]  That being his anti-war activity, but in fact, it seems like they're being very quiet, almost mute about Obama's intensification of the war.
[01:04:54.098 --> 01:04:55.340]  Tex Marr, stay with us.
[01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:59.243]  You're an expert in the occult and in these societies, one of the leading experts out there.
[01:04:59.263 --> 01:05:02.626]  In fact, he's in our film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:05:03.087 --> 01:05:04.968]  I made a new film called The Order of Death.
[01:05:04.988 --> 01:05:06.430]  They're both on the same DVD.
[01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:09.773]  And I'll tell you why I bring that up when we come back.
[01:05:10.592 --> 01:05:14.556]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:05:14.816 --> 01:05:16.598]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:05:16.818 --> 01:05:25.086]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:05:25.347 --> 01:05:30.572]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:05:30.892 --> 01:05:32.514]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:05:32.754 --> 01:05:39.076]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:05:39.257 --> 01:05:50.001]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:50.781]  That's right.

[01:06:10.495 --> 01:06:15.682]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:06:15.802 --> 01:06:20.168]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:06:20.328 --> 01:06:22.191]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:06:22.611 --> 01:06:23.973]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:06:24.233 --> 01:06:25.275]  There is a solution.

[01:08:11.514 --> 01:08:13.720]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:14.281 --> 01:08:17.088]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:33.307]  Tex Mars is our guest.
[01:08:33.367 --> 01:08:43.870]  The reason I brought up in the last segment, The Order of the Dead, the 45-minute film that's on the same DVD with the two-hour film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, that Tex is in.
[01:08:45.170 --> 01:08:55.213]  A few years after I snuck into Bohemian Grove with Mike Hanson, back in 2000, our camera guy, Ed Holman, was already out there visiting family in California.
[01:08:55.733 --> 01:08:58.374]  He drove up and there was the
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:13.506]  Bohemian Grove Action Network, the local peace group, who had criticized me in the newspaper saying there's nothing occult at the Grove, there's no occultism, Alex is a kook, there is no, you know, none of this is real.
[01:09:14.266 --> 01:09:15.907]  This was the group protesting the Grove.
[01:09:16.693 --> 01:09:29.339]  And it turned out they had a witch's cauldron out, were doing chants, like Luke Skywalker, believe they were firing force beams in, going, oh, power beam, power beam, you know, like a cartoon.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.100]  And it's the same thing Tex was just talking about.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:36.883]  You have this big anti-war group that supports Obama, but really it turns out it's a voodoo group.
[01:09:37.663 --> 01:09:40.685]  And that's what Santa Maria is, is a white magic variant of that.
[01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:46.770]  So going back to Text Mars, the headline at Infowars.com, voodoo in the White House.
[01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:49.732]  And it turns out Obama is very, very scared of this.
[01:09:50.473 --> 01:09:53.355]  But again, Obama shouldn't just be singled out.
[01:09:54.756 --> 01:09:56.618]  I'm sure they'll say voodoo is the new N-word.
[01:09:56.638 --> 01:09:59.940]  You're not allowed to criticize voodoo or you don't like Obama.
[01:10:00.601 --> 01:10:01.902]  But Text, please continue.
[01:10:02.574 --> 01:10:05.016]  Well, you know, you mentioned this group Code Pink.
[01:10:05.977 --> 01:10:19.830]  And what we have to understand about this group, this is a group that could possibly show up when folks like We Are Change, who are pretty good people, are out there and attempt to sort of play off of that.
[01:10:21.111 --> 01:10:23.373]  But let's look at the group, okay?
[01:10:23.994 --> 01:10:26.036]  First of all, I want people to understand
[01:10:26.809 --> 01:10:45.539]  That this is not some odd group in terms of the Obama White House, because in The Nation magazine, you know, The Nation is one of the more liberal magazines, it's been on bookstores, you know, Barnes & Noble and Borders bookstores shelves for, you know, years, decades and decades, so this is an old line
[01:10:46.195 --> 01:10:49.918]  Liberal, left-wing, Democrat Party publication.
[01:10:50.458 --> 01:11:07.891]  Now, Victor Nabofsky, who writes for The Nation on January the 20th, actually reported the fact that only, you know, when Obama was to be inaugurated, he invited his top campaign people
[01:11:08.723 --> 01:11:09.304]  Do you?
[01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:31.114]  Uh, for a rally to cleanse the White House for a Wiccan ritual by this Code Pink.
[01:11:31.555 --> 01:11:46.404]  Well, Alex, obviously I was very interested in finding out who is this Code Pink that is such a powerful group that its leaders are asked to ride on the campaign train with Obama and they're going to have this ritual to cleanse the White House.
[01:11:46.705 --> 01:11:50.427]  Well, I found three very interesting people who are the founders of it.
[01:11:50.747 --> 01:11:54.570]  The first one is the well-known witch, Miriam Starhawk.
[01:11:55.390 --> 01:12:02.833]  Uh, you know, my wife, Wanda, wrote the book, New Age Lies to Women, that exposed witchcraft in the Christian church, even.
[01:12:03.294 --> 01:12:05.895]  Starhawk is one of the people that she exposed.
[01:12:06.315 --> 01:12:08.756]  This Earth witchcraft Wicca activism...
[01:12:09.523 --> 01:12:15.467]  Uh, so Starhawk, and by the way that's not her real name, she's actually a Jewish woman named Miriam Simos.
[01:12:15.808 --> 01:12:18.890]  These are three Zionist Jewish women.
[01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:20.771]  Now this is what makes it interesting.
[01:12:21.192 --> 01:12:22.773]  They claim to be anti-war.
[01:12:22.853 --> 01:12:25.415]  They all are big backers of Obama.
[01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:28.477]  Uh, and they actually
[01:12:29.284 --> 01:12:30.004]  We're good to go.
[01:12:51.013 --> 01:12:57.297]  Nancy Pelosi, Arianna Huffington, all of these people wrote in this Code Pink book.
[01:12:57.317 --> 01:13:01.019]  So you can see the power level of this group.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:04.742]  Now the other two members are a woman named Jody Evans.
[01:13:04.842 --> 01:13:08.564]  Evidently she held this witchcraft ritual to cleanse the White House.
[01:13:09.205 --> 01:13:10.686]  She went down to El Salvador.
[01:13:10.726 --> 01:13:12.287]  All of these are communists, socialists.
[01:13:12.667 --> 01:13:14.288]  She went down to El Salvador
[01:13:15.368 --> 01:13:17.210]  Uh, to work with the Zapatistas.
[01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:22.674]  Her husband was a wealthy, although most of these women are lesbian, uh, she went down.
[01:13:22.734 --> 01:13:24.775]  She had a wealthy, uh, billionaire husband.
[01:13:25.496 --> 01:13:31.941]  By the way, they're a big supporter of the LGBT, you know, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender agenda.
[01:13:32.842 --> 01:13:43.810]  And they were very happy, I understand, yesterday because, uh, President Obama and Eric Holder, the Attorney General, uh, came out against the Defense of Marriage Act.
[01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:44.911]  They want it repealed.
[01:13:46.039 --> 01:14:03.630]  Uh, and that pleased the, uh, the lesbians and the, uh, transgender people, uh, but the big thing about Code Pink being socialist common is being part of the Obama campaign, uh, funding network, is that they are for a global government, in other words, the New World Order and a, and culture.
[01:14:04.531 --> 01:14:08.954]  But now get this, Alex, you know there's a law right now, if you were to send fifty dollars
[01:14:09.642 --> 01:14:15.627]  To some, you know, Arab group that they claim is Al-Qaeda, they'd put you in prison, would they not?
[01:14:17.148 --> 01:14:17.768]  Absolutely.
[01:14:18.248 --> 01:14:36.202]  Yeah, but wait, this group, Code Pink, gave $600,000 in food and medicine and cash to the Iraqi insurgents that were fighting the Americans and this whole deal for them to give this money
[01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:48.685]  And materials to the Al-Qaeda insurgent supposedly, if you even believe there's Al-Qaeda, in Iraq was all managed by Congressman Henry Waxman.
[01:14:49.093 --> 01:14:50.453]  But it expands from there.
[01:14:50.934 --> 01:14:56.896]  We now learn that Blackwater and others were bringing arms in, in federal documents, to the insurgents.
[01:14:57.136 --> 01:15:03.718]  That they were bringing in Taliban, this is confirmed, now mainstream news, into Iraq to kill the troops.
[01:15:04.038 --> 01:15:09.980]  The British Special Forces were caught in Basra dressed up like Sunnis shooting police.
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.641]  Now that's Times of London confirmed.
[01:15:13.001 --> 01:15:18.083]  And so, acting like peace activists, they're actually helping get the goods in.
[01:15:19.349 --> 01:15:20.590]  To continue what's happening?
[01:15:20.610 --> 01:15:21.390]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:34.979]  Yeah, absolutely, because what they want is to continue destabilizing the Iraqi economy and government, and that gives us, the United States and Israel, the pretext to maintain our troop support there.
[01:15:35.759 --> 01:15:46.946]  So while we can't leave as long as the... ...Waxman is Jewish, this congressman, and he's one of the biggest backers of Israel,
[01:15:48.194 --> 01:15:58.098]  So what is he doing helping this group Code Pink, this socialist communist group, give $600,000 to the insurgents at Fallujah in Iraq?
[01:15:58.298 --> 01:15:59.499]  You get the whole deal here.
[01:15:59.539 --> 01:16:01.940]  The picture is, they're the troublemakers.
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:10.563]  They have to destabilize the country, and that is a pretext for American military intervention and maintaining our forces over there.
[01:16:10.943 --> 01:16:12.544]  So the whole thing is a big setup.
[01:16:12.564 --> 01:16:17.746]  Now, by the way, the third founder, in addition to Witch Starhawk,
[01:16:18.405 --> 01:16:22.528]  And his Jodie Evans is a woman named Madea Benjamin.
[01:16:23.009 --> 01:16:33.017]  Now her real name is not Madea, it's Susan, but she changed it to Madea, which is the name of the Greek goddess of magic and witchcraft.
[01:16:34.639 --> 01:16:40.949]  Which I think is quite interesting, and thus again we see the witchcraft element in this code paint.
[01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:47.439]  Well, Tex, I want to go over that with you, but first, his mother-in-law
[01:16:51.221 --> 01:16:54.063]  Running around in the White House doing voodoo.
[01:16:56.045 --> 01:16:58.086]  Is there no end to this?
[01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:02.129]  Voodoo is about terrorizing people, scaring people.
[01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:06.173]  It says here that she believes she's dying even though she isn't sick.
[01:17:06.993 --> 01:17:09.415]  Classic voodoo superstition.
[01:17:10.696 --> 01:17:12.017]  Talk about voodoo economics.
[01:17:12.037 --> 01:17:14.259]  This is voodoo in the White House.
[01:17:14.926 --> 01:17:24.611]  Well, you're talking about the 72-year-old mother of Michelle Obama, Marianne Robinson, who evidently was practicing Santeria.
[01:17:25.371 --> 01:17:27.392]  And you're right, it is voodoo.
[01:17:28.293 --> 01:17:36.917]  And by the way, I have a picture of Obama in my upcoming video from the 1996 edition of The New Yorker.
[01:17:37.537 --> 01:17:44.621]  It pictures, you know, he was in his 30s then, Obama sitting with Michelle on their living room couch.
[01:17:45.419 --> 01:17:50.602]  She has a very close-cropped afro haircut.
[01:17:51.162 --> 01:17:55.705]  And right, it's very interesting, this whole thing was staged, this picture of the New Yorker.
[01:17:56.445 --> 01:18:09.193]  To his immediate right, on the table beside him in his living room, is a little statuette, an idol of a Santeria, basically a West African, because see, Santeria
[01:18:09.938 --> 01:18:19.222]  It's very big in the Caribbean, in Cuba, the Caribbean Islands, now of course, unfortunately, in Florida, they've been given Tax-Exempt 501c3.
[01:18:19.582 --> 01:18:33.689]  Tax-Exempt status as a church in America, although they, uh, they conduct rituals and... No, when you land anywhere in a cruise ship, now, I've only been on two cruises, and everywhere we land, they're out doing voodoo rituals when you get off, and they're taking it real serious, and
[01:18:34.818 --> 01:18:37.240]  And boy, look what Vudu's done for their country.
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:40.323]  I mean, it just absolutely brings your country down.
[01:18:40.383 --> 01:18:40.924]  But go ahead.
[01:18:40.944 --> 01:18:41.544]  Oh, it does.
[01:18:41.744 --> 01:18:46.669]  Well, here is Obama sitting, and right beside him is a devil god.
[01:18:47.236 --> 01:18:49.678]  Well, listen, we're doing a web search on this right now.
[01:18:49.718 --> 01:18:52.781]  You said that was in the New Yorker?
[01:18:52.801 --> 01:18:53.242]  Yeah, 1996.
[01:19:08.015 --> 01:19:12.361]  Okay, 1996 New Yorker photo, Michelle Obama, Barack Obama.
[01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:15.665]  Or photo, young Barack Obama and Michelle Obama.
[01:19:15.865 --> 01:19:16.266]  That's right.
[01:19:16.306 --> 01:19:22.154]  It's interesting that this, that in 1996 when Americans didn't even know who Barack Obama was,
[01:19:22.890 --> 01:19:28.233]  The New Yorker would profile this young and up-and-coming man with his wife.
[01:19:28.813 --> 01:19:30.874]  But again, the big thing was... We found it!
[01:19:30.954 --> 01:19:31.454]  We found it!
[01:19:31.494 --> 01:19:32.174]  We found the photo.
[01:19:32.214 --> 01:19:32.835]  I'm sorry to interrupt.
[01:19:32.855 --> 01:19:33.255]  Okay, good.
[01:19:33.455 --> 01:19:33.675]  Good.
[01:19:34.035 --> 01:19:40.018]  Notice to his right, in fact, I believe even his arm is headed that way.
[01:19:40.518 --> 01:19:43.400]  And notice that they have the V there.
[01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:49.583]  Now, Nelson Mandela was a big practicer, or is a big practicer, of this
[01:19:50.735 --> 01:20:00.400]  Uh, religion, which is really an African-American religion that was brought over by the slaves and became big in Cuba and throughout the Caribbean.
[01:20:01.041 --> 01:20:01.741]  All right, stay there.
[01:20:01.881 --> 01:20:04.803]  Voodoo, the new religion of the United States.
[01:20:04.863 --> 01:20:09.246]  There is a religion now in America.
[01:20:09.726 --> 01:20:10.126]  Voodoo.
[01:20:10.206 --> 01:20:10.906]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:11.447 --> 01:20:14.668]  Most Americans know the significance of July 4th, 1776.
[01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:23.413]  However, few know the importance of September 17th, 1787, the day the Constitution was written and adopted by our founders.
[01:20:23.753 --> 01:20:28.116]  Unfortunately, over 200 years later, this sacred document is under attack
[01:20:28.636 --> 01:20:30.217]  Along with our beloved Republic.
[01:20:30.417 --> 01:20:37.102]  Throughout the span of history, brave men and women have rallied behind banners which have served as symbols of liberty against the forces of tyranny.
[01:20:37.542 --> 01:20:48.449]  Today, we have the Constitution Pride Flag to show our support for the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, freedom, liberty, and justice for we the people of the United States.
[01:20:48.889 --> 01:20:59.078]  Now available at www.1787flags.com Get your very own Constitution Pride Flag today and receive a free pocket constitution with your order.
[01:20:59.718 --> 01:21:06.264]  www.1787flags.com The official website of the Constitution Pride Flag.
[01:21:06.444 --> 01:21:08.026]  That's www.1787flags.com
[01:21:10.828 --> 01:21:11.188]  Good day.
[01:21:11.409 --> 01:21:12.910]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:13.351]  August 18, 2009.
[01:21:13.471 --> 01:21:14.412]  Gold opened this morning at $9.3780.
[01:21:14.452 --> 01:21:17.855]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.6472, $4.8236 for a half-ounce, or $2.4118 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:21:17.895 --> 01:21:18.375]  That's $9.6472, $4.8236, or $2.4118.
[01:21:30.527 --> 01:21:44.078]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[01:21:44.158 --> 01:21:52.785]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:21:52.966 --> 01:21:53.986]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:21:54.107 --> 01:21:58.230]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:59.451]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:59.531 --> 01:22:01.354]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[01:22:01.374 --> 01:22:01.554]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:01.614 --> 01:22:01.914]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:11.579 --> 01:22:16.906]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:17.606 --> 01:22:22.953]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:22:23.513 --> 01:22:29.661]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:30.001 --> 01:22:31.801]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:31.942 --> 01:22:34.342]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:34.422 --> 01:22:45.365]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:47.585 --> 01:22:48.886]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:49.266 --> 01:22:50.646]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:51.126 --> 01:22:57.368]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:58.032 --> 01:23:05.803]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:06.304 --> 01:23:07.445]  The Obama Deception.
[01:23:07.886 --> 01:23:09.068]  The people strike back!
[01:23:11.365 --> 01:23:13.966]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:23:14.366 --> 01:23:19.328]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:23:19.708 --> 01:23:21.429]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:23:21.749 --> 01:23:26.571]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:23:26.751 --> 01:23:27.711]  How much do you want?
[01:23:27.931 --> 01:23:28.671]  When do you want it?
[01:23:29.051 --> 01:23:30.652]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:23:30.952 --> 01:23:31.772]  When will you need it?
[01:23:32.012 --> 01:23:34.073]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:23:34.213 --> 01:23:35.334]  Will there be any food?
[01:23:35.554 --> 01:23:36.154]  Will it make your
[01:23:36.754 --> 01:23:42.137]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:23:42.337 --> 01:23:45.559]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:23:45.919 --> 01:23:49.421]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:23:49.741 --> 01:23:50.741]  How much will you need?
[01:23:50.981 --> 01:23:51.582]  We don't know.
[01:23:51.882 --> 01:23:52.802]  How much do you want?
[01:23:52.982 --> 01:23:53.723]  All you can get.
[01:23:53.903 --> 01:23:54.743]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:23:55.003 --> 01:23:57.765]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:23:58.045 --> 01:24:00.326]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoods.com.
[01:24:04.548 --> 01:24:06.549]  Folks, we do have both a Texas Encyclopedic with
[01:24:28.954 --> 01:24:31.318]  Hundreds and hundreds of photos and documents per book.
[01:24:31.859 --> 01:24:37.229]  Mysterious monuments, encyclopedia of secret Illuminati designs, Masonic architecture and occult practices.
[01:24:37.609 --> 01:24:38.952]  Their language is everywhere!
[01:24:39.974 --> 01:24:45.739]  And if you want to know what's really going on, even if you're a Mason, low-level, and don't know what you're a part of, this will tell you.
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:49.063]  Codex Magicka, same thing.
[01:24:49.163 --> 01:24:50.424]  Hardcore information.
[01:24:50.464 --> 01:24:53.286]  In Texas, one of the top researchers out there.
[01:24:54.207 --> 01:24:57.651]  Also, my film, combo film, two films on one DVD, 1995.
[01:24:58.171 --> 01:25:01.594]  We're going to show you some clips of it, just the video.
[01:25:02.595 --> 01:25:12.464]  Again, this local group criticized us for showing the ritual and got real mad and we got phone calls and they wrote articles for local news going, how dare you show that ritual?
[01:25:13.224 --> 01:25:14.285]  That's not what's bad.
[01:25:14.345 --> 01:25:15.767]  What's bad is their policies.
[01:25:16.247 --> 01:25:17.108]  That's not occultic.
[01:25:17.128 --> 01:25:18.049]  There's nothing going on.
[01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:18.849]  You faked it.
[01:25:18.889 --> 01:25:22.352]  It's all lies, you son of a... And I was like, man, they're really mad.
[01:25:22.432 --> 01:25:29.578]  Well, then we happen to go back a few years later and find out they do a ritual every year and these people were deeply
[01:25:30.342 --> 01:25:37.448]  I mean, witch's pots, you know, literally going, in fact, you can cue it up later before Tex Lees will actually find the scene.
[01:25:38.368 --> 01:25:41.050]  In fact, they're invoking spirits right there on the video.
[01:25:41.731 --> 01:25:43.412]  And they're going, give me the power!
[01:25:43.432 --> 01:25:44.613]  Oh, yes!
[01:25:44.693 --> 01:25:46.635]  And then they go, power beam!
[01:25:46.655 --> 01:25:48.857]  I mean, it's like five-year-olds playing like they're...
[01:25:49.781 --> 01:25:51.042]  In fact, cue it up right there.
[01:25:51.763 --> 01:25:54.966]  Show the warlock, the man with the beard, the Gandalf character.
[01:25:55.287 --> 01:25:57.849]  Cue it up to him when they invoke the spirits.
[01:25:57.869 --> 01:25:59.391]  And they thank the spirits for being there.
[01:25:59.711 --> 01:26:00.872]  There's the witch's pot.
[01:26:02.394 --> 01:26:03.895]  She plays the part of the young goddess.
[01:26:05.047 --> 01:26:07.247]  I mean, this just goes on and on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:07.267 --> 01:26:07.848]  And whatever!
[01:26:08.168 --> 01:26:11.288]  The issue is, most CPS workers are these people.
[01:26:11.568 --> 01:26:13.229]  And they hunt Christian kids down.
[01:26:13.549 --> 01:26:14.249]  We've proven it.
[01:26:14.509 --> 01:26:15.489]  They love taking them.
[01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:17.789]  And where else can you snatch kids?
[01:26:17.809 --> 01:26:19.170]  I mean, I'm just telling you what they're into.
[01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:21.150]  Am I saying all these people are into that?
[01:26:21.170 --> 01:26:21.530]  No.
[01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:24.291]  But the point is, they always say there's none of this going on.
[01:26:24.571 --> 01:26:29.312]  The truth is, they don't want you knowing about their religion, because their religion is king in this world.
[01:26:29.652 --> 01:26:31.192]  Text Mars, please continue, sir.
[01:26:31.892 --> 01:26:38.802]  So you told us about the photo, we pulled it up, of Barack Obama with his wife, with this particular God.
[01:26:38.822 --> 01:26:45.452]  You were getting into this being an African-American religion brought over from Africa, voodoo, spirit possession.
[01:26:45.512 --> 01:26:46.132]  Tell us what it is.
[01:26:46.872 --> 01:26:54.637]  Okay, now, when we look at Santeria, it comes from West Africa, from Nigeria, from the Congo, and slaves brought it back.
[01:26:55.477 --> 01:27:01.501]  And it really, you know, took over Havana, Cuba, throughout the Caribbean.
[01:27:01.921 --> 01:27:14.069]  And by the way, there is a church given official status in the United States, and there was a little problem with it because they wanted to, and they do, they actually, to this very day, it is now legal
[01:27:14.659 --> 01:27:25.752]  For this church, according to the Supreme Court, the Church of Babalui, the Church of Babalui, which is a Santeria church, worship of God, demons,
[01:27:26.616 --> 01:27:48.020]  And they sacrificed chickens, goats, some say cats and dogs, and in one case, up in New York State, they actually sacrificed a young girl, a young beautiful cheerleader, 17 year old, put a plastic bag over her head, and had a Santeria demonic exorcism for her, of course she ended up dead.
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:28:02.563]  So this is a very dangerous religion, but when you begin to sacrifice chickens and goats and they use the blood for various things, they also use the menstrual blood of women and mix it with some kind of evil potion.
[01:28:03.043 --> 01:28:13.826]  By the way, Abu Ghraib, as you know, but also at Camp X-Ray, they let the CIA interrogators practice raping the Muslim men with menstruating women to freak them out.
[01:28:14.326 --> 01:28:17.487]  But notice it's always an excuse to really just do their ritual.
[01:28:18.486 --> 01:28:19.026]  Absolutely.
[01:28:19.046 --> 01:28:20.307]  Now, here's an interesting thing.
[01:28:20.987 --> 01:28:26.109]  You know, I did some research some time ago of this Trinity United Church of Christ.
[01:28:26.769 --> 01:28:31.070]  A member of Obama was a member there for 20 years, Dr. Jeremiah Wright.
[01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:35.952]  If you go online, you can still get, I checked it out today right before this program,
[01:28:36.826 --> 01:28:41.048]  They actually have About Us, Trinity United Church of Christ Chicago.
[01:28:41.068 --> 01:28:42.829]  There's a section called About Us.
[01:28:43.149 --> 01:28:45.030]  I want to read to you the very first line.
[01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:47.271]  This is what his church was all about.
[01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:49.212]  He cannot say he did not know this.
[01:28:49.252 --> 01:28:52.894]  This is their official statement of beliefs and doctrines.
[01:28:53.475 --> 01:28:54.535]  Every church has this.
[01:28:55.235 --> 01:29:01.999]  It says, we are a congregation, which, and I'm going to get back to this voodoo Santeria from this, Alex.
[01:29:02.379 --> 01:29:05.821]  It says, we are a congregation which is unashamedly black.
[01:29:07.398 --> 01:29:19.286]  It says, we are an African people and remain true to our native land, the Mother Continent, the cradle of civilization.
[01:29:21.367 --> 01:29:22.448]  This is amazing!
[01:29:22.908 --> 01:29:32.194]  Here is a church dedicated to African tribalism ritual, the Mother Continent.
[01:29:32.374 --> 01:29:36.437]  Yeah, it's a front for a voodoo cult, no doubt about that.
[01:29:37.256 --> 01:29:44.198]  There is not one mention of Jesus Christ in the entire, they have a value system, they have 12 things we believe in.
[01:29:44.818 --> 01:29:47.318]  Not one thing relates to Jesus Christ.
[01:29:47.338 --> 01:29:47.698]  Not one.
[01:29:47.718 --> 01:29:49.119]  We're going to go there during the break.
[01:29:49.239 --> 01:29:59.901]  Tex, tell my producers, and they're doing a great job, producers, directors, camera guys are doing the whole show, tell Jaron and Paul, during the break, the URL, we're going to show it to people when we get back.
[01:30:01.221 --> 01:30:02.121]  We're on the march.
[01:30:02.602 --> 01:30:04.102]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:05.103 --> 01:30:07.986]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.868 --> 01:30:15.852]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:30:16.073 --> 01:30:19.876]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:20.096 --> 01:30:25.701]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:26.001 --> 01:30:30.865]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:31.065 --> 01:30:31.526]  Number three,
[01:30:31.966 --> 01:30:37.412]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:30:38.273 --> 01:30:40.916]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:30:41.176 --> 01:30:45.381]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:45.701 --> 01:30:49.305]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:30:49.525 --> 01:30:55.026]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[01:31:11.871 --> 01:31:13.653]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:31:13.873 --> 01:31:14.514]  Well, you should.

[01:32:11.079 --> 01:32:14.601]  ...MZ in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[01:32:14.802 --> 01:32:17.223]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[01:32:17.363 --> 01:32:26.929]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[01:32:27.049 --> 01:32:32.933]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[01:32:33.253 --> 01:32:35.755]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[01:32:35.955 --> 01:32:38.336]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[01:32:39.397 --> 01:32:39.597]  I think so.
[01:33:02.162 --> 01:33:03.463]  OwnMyself.com.
[01:33:03.643 --> 01:33:04.703]  It takes very little money.
[01:33:04.824 --> 01:33:07.245]  And if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[01:33:07.425 --> 01:33:09.966]  Remember, Chocolate.OwnMyself.com.
[01:33:11.267 --> 01:33:13.388]  Big Jock.
[01:33:14.129 --> 01:33:16.130]  Big Jock.
[01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:19.912]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[01:33:19.952 --> 01:33:22.273]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[01:33:22.333 --> 01:33:25.295]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[01:33:25.375 --> 01:33:28.997]  And everybody knew you didn't give no lip to Big Jock.
[01:33:30.865 --> 01:33:35.508]  By the way, I was talking to Rob out during the break and he goes, Alex, don't you remember?
[01:33:35.528 --> 01:33:43.072]  Tarpley's unauthorized biography has Reverend Wright doing voodoo rituals on Halloween night every year.
[01:33:44.093 --> 01:33:48.435]  And I forgot Tarpley said that like a year ago, and that's when I was like, Tarpley, you're nuts.
[01:33:49.375 --> 01:33:53.577]  Because even though I know all this stuff, or a lot of it, I still can't believe it.
[01:33:54.237 --> 01:33:59.819]  And so Rob's out there flipping through the book, finding the part for me, because I don't remember where it is in the book, to highlight it.
[01:34:00.299 --> 01:34:01.219]  We'll show you that.
[01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:06.481]  But Tex, during the break, you were telling me to flip to a page of mysterious monuments.
[01:34:07.062 --> 01:34:07.402]  What was it?
[01:34:07.422 --> 01:34:07.642]  386, you said?
[01:34:07.662 --> 01:34:07.882]  Yeah, page 386.
[01:34:11.693 --> 01:34:23.562]  You know, these people, they mix all of this magic stuff and Santeria, African-American religion, black theology, you know, the black liberation theology.
[01:34:24.102 --> 01:34:33.388]  But here is a news item from USA Today, an actual picture from page 386 of my own book, Mysterious Monument, that you offer folks there.
[01:34:33.809 --> 01:34:36.130]  And, you know, people say, which is in Washington, D.C.? ?
[01:34:37.423 --> 01:34:43.486]  Doing a ritual to cleanse the White House in preparation for Obama taking over.
[01:34:44.186 --> 01:34:45.247]  But look at this one.
[01:34:45.827 --> 01:34:47.748]  This is from the USA Today newspaper.
[01:34:48.688 --> 01:34:49.648]  And it shows these witches.
[01:34:49.708 --> 01:34:50.789]  Now, they do this every year.
[01:34:50.829 --> 01:34:58.552]  They're scheduled this September to go back again for their, I think it's their 18th annual prayer vigil.
[01:34:59.133 --> 01:35:06.356]  Now, notice it's exactly 33 hours, Alex, because 33 is the highest ritual number of
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:09.522]  Freemasonry, Scottish Rite Freemasonry, 33.
[01:35:09.562 --> 01:35:14.626]  33 just happens to be the age in which Jesus Christ was slain on the cross.
[01:35:15.627 --> 01:35:21.071]  And there are other various satanic reasons that they honor in numerology the number 33.
[01:35:21.671 --> 01:35:34.621]  But notice they're doing a circle witchcraft ritual around what else but the obelisk, which is the phallus of the sun god in ancient mystery religion symbology.
[01:35:35.602 --> 01:35:36.703]  So they're worshiping the
[01:35:37.796 --> 01:35:42.562]  Dare I say it, the sex organ of the Sun God.
[01:35:43.964 --> 01:35:45.545]  And this is in Washington D.C.
[01:35:48.129 --> 01:35:54.536]  I would not be surprised if Code Pink was there with the witch Starhawk, one of their founders.
[01:35:55.177 --> 01:35:57.220]  But Alex, back to this United
[01:35:59.572 --> 01:36:04.315]  Yeah, in fact we have their website.
[01:36:04.355 --> 01:36:09.798]  Here it is exactly, as you said, it's an African Spiritual Center for Voodoo.
[01:36:10.338 --> 01:36:11.859]  They just basically admit it right there.
[01:36:20.748 --> 01:36:25.412]  that he uses is from Professor James Cone, Harvard University.
[01:36:25.732 --> 01:36:32.237]  Now, that's old, uh, Barack Obama's alma mater, the same place where, you know, Professor Gates came, uh, comes from.
[01:36:32.837 --> 01:36:40.983]  Now, Professor Cone wrote the, the, I mean, the primal textbook entitled A Black Theology of Liberation.
[01:36:41.564 --> 01:36:44.266]  And on page 62 is an amazing quote.
[01:36:44.666 --> 01:36:47.008]  Alex, I'd like to read because it'll explain a lot.
[01:36:47.808 --> 01:36:48.329]  It says,
[01:36:49.167 --> 01:37:08.300]  The goal of black theology, now remember this is what was taught all 20 years at this church that Obama went to, the goal of black theology is the destruction of everything white so that blacks can be liberated from alien gods.
[01:37:10.401 --> 01:37:12.903]  Now alien gods would be Jesus Christ,
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:16.260]  He's an alien god of the white man!
[01:37:16.541 --> 01:37:38.746]  But I'll tell you this, I've discovered in writings, and I'm sure I've never really seen anything that I'm aware of that Texas isn't already aware of, or very rarely so, that actually the white supremacist a hundred years ago, the eugenicist, said if we can't ship all the blacks back to Africa, we'll fund a black liberation movement to balkanize them and to make them not want to intermarry with anybody but blacks.
[01:37:39.346 --> 01:37:43.387]  And you see today that a lot of blacks don't want black babies adopted out to anybody else.
[01:37:43.787 --> 01:37:45.127]  Let them stay in institutions.
[01:37:45.447 --> 01:37:47.108]  Don't marry anybody but a black person.
[01:37:47.388 --> 01:37:49.288]  The white supremacists actually like that.
[01:37:49.648 --> 01:37:53.629]  So this is a very, very slick system for the eugenicists.
[01:37:53.689 --> 01:38:04.652]  If they can't kill the blacks off, they'll at least fund and finance the most destructive things of African culture, like voodoo, and get them to have it part of their culture to only stay with each other.
[01:38:05.212 --> 01:38:06.933]  And that's Black's right if they want to do that.
[01:38:07.293 --> 01:38:09.774]  I'm just saying the big foundations funded that.
[01:38:09.854 --> 01:38:10.915]  Were you aware of that, Tex?
[01:38:11.715 --> 01:38:12.235]  Yes, I am.
[01:38:12.275 --> 01:38:16.537]  In fact, even the Communist Party USA promoted that very idea.
[01:38:16.617 --> 01:38:21.820]  Gus Hall, you know, one of the top guys there for 17 years, the president of it.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:27.242]  One of his main things was to reach out and bring blacks into the Communist Party.
[01:38:27.743 --> 01:38:32.445]  And thus, the reason why Frank Marshall Davis, who was Barack Obama's mentor,
[01:38:33.807 --> 01:38:37.849]  Uh, over in, uh, you know, Hawaii, he was a member of the Communist Party USA.
[01:38:37.869 --> 01:38:44.071]  So, there has been this communist, socialist, uh, African, uh, religion thing.
[01:38:44.651 --> 01:38:55.015]  By the way, this, this Trinity United Church of Christ, in their statement of beliefs, they call it the, the, the black, uh, what's it called?
[01:38:55.155 --> 01:38:56.816]  Oh yeah, black value system.
[01:38:57.532 --> 01:39:02.793]  Number eight is very interesting, and I think you've got it right there yourself on the internet.
[01:39:03.354 --> 01:39:07.475]  It's the disavowal of the pursuit of middle class at this.
[01:39:09.195 --> 01:39:11.596]  In other words, they want to stay blacks.
[01:39:12.276 --> 01:39:14.437]  They want to stay victims forever.
[01:39:15.737 --> 01:39:18.978]  They say, we will not pursue being part of the middle class.
[01:39:19.605 --> 01:39:26.027]  Well, notice they tell white yuppies, homogenize, give up your class, because they see that as the dominant group.
[01:39:26.327 --> 01:39:30.388]  And then the other groups, they want them balkanized so they can play us off against each other.
[01:39:31.188 --> 01:39:31.748]  Absolutely.
[01:39:31.788 --> 01:39:32.608]  This is the whole thing.
[01:39:33.488 --> 01:39:39.210]  They want blacks to stay away from the middle class because
[01:39:41.193 --> 01:39:50.441]  In other words, if we can stay to ourselves, stay a slave race, and then of course we'll be warriors against everything white.
[01:39:51.042 --> 01:39:56.006]  Their black theology, liberation theology, is the destruction of everything white.
[01:39:56.447 --> 01:40:02.892]  Now why is it that the liberal left-wing press in America, NBC, ABC, CBS News, CNN,
[01:40:03.733 --> 01:40:10.580]  Why aren't they concerned about such a blatant racism on the part of this church?
[01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:11.781]  Well, let me just stop you.
[01:40:11.801 --> 01:40:22.451]  I'm reading Tarpley's book here, trying to... I read it and remember, but I'm trying to find the part in Barack H. Obama, the unauthorized biography that we have available at InfoWars.com, just totally separately.
[01:40:22.471 --> 01:40:23.992]  He's a historian backing you up.
[01:40:25.130 --> 01:40:37.994]  And he just is reporting the facts about voodoo rituals at the church, about the Trilateral Commission funding Jeremiah Wright, and how they control these communities in the big cities through these groups.
[01:40:38.074 --> 01:40:39.595]  So, just amazing text.
[01:40:40.135 --> 01:40:40.395]  It is.
[01:40:40.435 --> 01:40:47.297]  Now, another element that's part of this, this anti-Christianity, is the Freemasonry.
[01:40:47.955 --> 01:40:50.056]  The Secret Society, known as Freemasonry.
[01:40:50.917 --> 01:40:53.538]  And in fact, I have an ad, I'm looking at it here.
[01:40:54.139 --> 01:41:05.706]  The Masons actually had a Masonic Inaugural Ball for the 44th President of the United States, Barack Obama, sponsored by the Washington, D.C.
[01:41:05.766 --> 01:41:06.446]  Lodge No.
[01:41:06.466 --> 01:41:06.446]  7.
[01:41:06.767 --> 01:41:07.967]  I think that's interesting.
[01:41:07.987 --> 01:41:12.190]  Of course, Barack Obama is reputedly a member of the Prince Hall Masons.
[01:41:12.210 --> 01:41:13.851]  That's the Black Masons.
[01:41:14.557 --> 01:41:31.245]  And it's interesting here again, the Masonic Lodge has purposely created a black, a segregated black Masonic group called the Prince Hall Masons, and every well-known black leader is a member of it.
[01:41:32.926 --> 01:41:35.467]  Reverend Al Sharpton, yep, he's a Mason.
[01:41:35.927 --> 01:41:38.828]  Jesse Jackson, you better believe it, he is a Mason.
[01:41:41.773 --> 01:41:44.415]  What's the guy at the head of the NAACP, Andrew Young?
[01:41:44.895 --> 01:41:47.256]  He's a Mason, a former head.
[01:41:47.276 --> 01:41:52.739]  So, all of the top, from Jesse Jackson to Barack Obama, they're all high-level Masons.
[01:41:53.159 --> 01:42:01.084]  In fact, even Louis Farrakhan of the Black Muslims, he is also a 33rd degree Prince Hall Mason.
[01:42:01.944 --> 01:42:08.588]  So, the Masonic thing, and of course, they literally worship this ancient mystery religion god.
[01:42:09.128 --> 01:42:10.629]  His name is Jaboulon.
[01:42:11.601 --> 01:42:29.279]  So, you see where everything comes together with these pagan mystery religions, whether it's Code Pink, whether it's Trinity United Church of Christ, that Obama went to, whether it's the Freemasons, whether it's the Santeria religion of Michelle Obama's mother,
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:35.942]  I noticed a text, I want you to finish that key point, but they always want to keep it secret.
[01:42:36.342 --> 01:42:38.342]  The devil's biggest trick is denying he exists.
[01:42:38.362 --> 01:42:40.883]  They always want to deny they're sacrificing people.
[01:42:40.903 --> 01:42:50.506]  When every one of these cults did this, whether it was the Aztecs, or Northern Europeans, or Central Asian cults, or African cults, they all sacrificed people.
[01:42:50.986 --> 01:42:55.087]  Why, through all the anthropology of the world and its whole history,
[01:42:55.687 --> 01:42:58.288]  Of man, do you see these devil cults?
[01:42:58.468 --> 01:42:59.429]  What is the point?
[01:42:59.809 --> 01:43:01.510]  Why does this keep reoccurring?
[01:43:01.810 --> 01:43:09.694]  Looking at it as a professor, I understand you're saying it's religious, it's good, it's evil, but atheists will say this isn't even going on.
[01:43:10.054 --> 01:43:14.396]  They can only identify Christianity and say it's quaint and old-fashioned and stupid.
[01:43:14.676 --> 01:43:26.804]  But they love all the other religions, as the United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment Treaty of 96 says, we will reintroduce the pagan cults of human sacrifice and of killing humans for the earth.
[01:43:27.144 --> 01:43:28.685]  This will be our new world religion.
[01:43:29.875 --> 01:43:36.482]  There is, you know, and I must go back to religion because in the Old Testament there is something very interesting.
[01:43:36.502 --> 01:43:44.591]  No, but that's what I'm saying, Tex, is that yes, we're Christians, but I'm saying the atheists will deny this exists just from an anthropology view.
[01:43:44.951 --> 01:43:45.812]  What are they hiding?
[01:43:45.852 --> 01:43:46.173]  Go ahead.
[01:43:46.573 --> 01:44:12.924]  Well, that's silly for them because the history of the world, and of course there are many, many groups in America now trying to return America to the Mexican pre-history days of the Aztecs, the Incas, and horrible, I call it witchcraft, basically human sacrifice again at the pyramids down in Mexico and Mesoamerica.
[01:44:14.304 --> 01:44:16.205]  This is very, very strong.
[01:44:16.265 --> 01:44:24.786]  People believe that this is a fringe group, but in actuality, Wicca and all of this Santeria stuff, this is huge.
[01:44:24.966 --> 01:44:27.647]  This is one of the fastest growing religions in the world.
[01:44:28.347 --> 01:44:29.667]  And it all works together.
[01:44:29.727 --> 01:44:35.408]  And they will even practice to deceive Christians.
[01:44:36.389 --> 01:44:40.510]  They'll try to bring, for example, one of the Santeria goddesses
[01:44:43.662 --> 01:44:58.917]  Uh, is, is called, uh, Ocean, uh, let's see, I think she's called, yeah, uh, Bamiya, Bamiya, which really is Mother Mary of Christianity, with all the trappings, though, of these demon gods of Santeria.
[01:45:00.319 --> 01:45:04.703]  So, this is how they try to even, you know, uh, pollute, uh, uh, Christianity.
[01:45:05.344 --> 01:45:07.126]  Uh, and this is well known, uh, as well.
[01:45:07.875 --> 01:45:20.124]  But I want to emphasize that many blacks are falling for this today because originally this came from Africa, from the Congo, from West Africa, from Nigeria.
[01:45:20.704 --> 01:45:23.526]  So we have a huge contingent of these foreigners.
[01:45:23.867 --> 01:45:27.209]  I mean, this is the ultimate, Alex, in multiculturalism, isn't it?
[01:45:28.857 --> 01:45:50.918]  Well, it certainly is, Tex, and I'm trying to pull Webster Tarpley up live on air right now because I wanted to get him, because the show's almost over here, I wanted to get him to comment on what is in his book, page 8, about Obama himself is much more likely a Satanist of the apostate Jeremiah Wright
[01:45:52.785 --> 01:46:01.709]  Liberation Theology School, a Christian heresy, which places racial hatred instead of charity, the center of its edifice of faith.
[01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:04.591]  Wright is ultimately the high priest of a death cult.
[01:46:04.991 --> 01:46:12.554]  Obama is, more precisely, an existentialist fascist, made up of equal parts in 1969, Weatherman race war theory,
[01:46:14.435 --> 01:46:21.321]  And it just goes on to then talk about the bizarre voodoo stuff basically going on there at Wright's Church.
[01:46:21.722 --> 01:46:29.188]  So I just thought this was interesting that Tarpley wrote this book a year ago that we carry at InfoWars.com and here it is manifesting in the news.
[01:46:29.728 --> 01:46:30.669]  It's just incredible.
[01:46:31.090 --> 01:46:32.391]  Please continue with your comments.
[01:46:32.898 --> 01:46:35.540]  Well, I think that is interesting, those comments by Torplatt.
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:38.022]  I think he had quite a bit of insight.
[01:46:38.342 --> 01:46:41.004]  Now, here's another little thread that we can go by.
[01:46:41.785 --> 01:46:48.910]  Abner Mikva, who is a well-known Jewish lawyer out of Chicago, he was White House counsel.
[01:46:48.930 --> 01:46:55.535]  Now, here's a powerful man, White House counsel, the top lawyer for Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky hearings.
[01:46:55.955 --> 01:46:57.677]  But he was a big, and he is a big,
[01:46:58.357 --> 01:46:58.798]  We're good to go.
[01:47:18.686 --> 01:47:24.691]  And it was because of his support from these millionaire and billionaire Jews from Chicago and overseas.
[01:47:25.192 --> 01:47:39.544]  But Mikba, who was one of the supporters, said that as a young man, an aspiring young politician, young Barack Obama came to him, now remember this is the Chicago Tribune, and said, how can I best get ahead in politics?
[01:47:40.264 --> 01:47:43.127]  And Mikba, who is Jewish, said to him,
[01:47:43.783 --> 01:47:50.886]  The first thing you need to do, Barack, is to go and join a powerful black church.
[01:47:51.547 --> 01:47:57.790]  You need a power base, and the way to do it is to go join a big black church.
[01:47:58.270 --> 01:48:01.391]  Okay, Tex, we're gonna take you into the final segment here.
[01:48:01.431 --> 01:48:02.272]  The show is almost over.
[01:48:02.292 --> 01:48:05.133]  We're gonna have to have a part two on this because it's so important.
[01:48:05.173 --> 01:48:08.715]  Just for a minute and a half, Tarpley, because the show's about to end here.
[01:48:09.375 --> 01:48:27.905]  uh... in about ten minutes webster tarpley i i just am always amazed how much you wrote or talked about ends up coming true or was correct text the same thing your unauthorized biography that people should get page eight you call him a satanist you get into weird stuff in your book on halloween voodoo stuff going on
[01:48:29.679 --> 01:48:36.162]  Jeremiah Wright's church, and now it's mainstream news they're doing voodoo rituals in the White House.
[01:48:36.242 --> 01:48:40.304]  Obama comments on... Tarpley comments on this Obama situation.
[01:48:40.784 --> 01:48:51.648]  Well, what I was trying to get at in that book, Barack H. Obama, The Unauthorized Biography, is simply the question of, is it possible to come to Christ through Jeremiah Wright?
[01:48:51.708 --> 01:48:53.729]  Because that is what Obama asserts.
[01:48:53.769 --> 01:48:57.031]  He said, I came to Jesus Christ through Jeremiah Wright.
[01:48:57.071 --> 01:48:57.851]  Now, I would argue
[01:48:58.590 --> 01:49:06.894]  This is not easy to do, because if you look at Jeremiah Wright, this is essentially a minority, radical school of theology.
[01:49:06.954 --> 01:49:20.421]  It's the so-called Black Liberation Theology, set up by a fellow called James Cone and some others, which essentially says that the entire Christian story is limited to one ethnic group.
[01:49:20.681 --> 01:49:25.664]  And if you're not part of that ethnic group, then you're not part of the
[01:49:26.084 --> 01:49:28.045]  So it's a fundamental attack on Christianity.
[01:49:28.785 --> 01:49:29.946]  Webster, we're almost out of time here.
[01:49:30.246 --> 01:49:36.809]  Regardless, specifically, you talk about him, though, being more like a Satanist and the weird stuff at the church.
[01:49:37.009 --> 01:49:40.371]  Is the church, from your research, a front for voodoo or santeria?
[01:49:40.871 --> 01:49:42.372]  No, I don't know anything about that part.
[01:49:42.412 --> 01:49:48.355]  But what you see from Cohn is he says that the purpose, the task of God and of Christ
[01:49:49.128 --> 01:50:00.092]  Is to assist in the suppression of the white population of the world, which I think makes it, therefore, into a religion of hatred, in effect.
[01:50:00.152 --> 01:50:03.253]  And I believe this is all subsidized by the foundations.
[01:50:03.713 --> 01:50:05.954]  This is a theology of counterinsurgency.
[01:50:06.294 --> 01:50:11.256]  The goal is to pit white against black, and indeed other groups in this country, all against themselves.
[01:50:11.676 --> 01:50:16.177]  So the bankers in Wall Street never experience a direct challenge to their rule.
[01:50:16.217 --> 01:50:24.400]  And I think that's why the foundations pay right and pay people like Dwight Hopkins and that church and indeed Cohen, right?
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:26.281]  So it's all balkanization.
[01:50:26.361 --> 01:50:27.521]  It's all balkanization.
[01:50:27.841 --> 01:50:29.442]  Webster, thanks for popping in with us.
[01:50:29.482 --> 01:50:31.362]  I just wanted to get you to comment on your book.
[01:50:31.382 --> 01:50:32.302]  Thank you.
[01:50:32.582 --> 01:50:32.963]  Thank you.
[01:50:33.163 --> 01:50:40.485]  Going back to Tex, we've got a few minutes on the other side, but basically he's saying the same thing you're saying, Tex, from a completely different political angle.
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:42.340]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:48.943]  So, we can't say that the United Church of Christ, or the Trinity United Church of Christ, is a voodoo Santeria church.
[01:50:49.263 --> 01:50:56.586]  But we can say that it is based on paganism, African tribalism, and really a worship of the black race.
[01:50:56.686 --> 01:50:58.046]  It is a racist church.
[01:50:58.386 --> 01:51:01.468]  But they do do weird things on Halloween there, actually.
[01:51:01.588 --> 01:51:03.928]  I've heard that, too.
[01:51:04.108 --> 01:51:10.651]  And of course, they don't have any problem in bringing in a Catholic priest, but then Louie Sterricon as well.
[01:51:10.991 --> 01:51:12.233]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:12.273 --> 01:51:17.639]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:22.485]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:22.886 --> 01:51:27.912]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:28.453 --> 01:51:33.159]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:33.679 --> 01:51:35.601]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:51:36.002 --> 01:51:40.607]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:40.807 --> 01:51:41.708]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:41.929 --> 01:51:44.692]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:44.992 --> 01:51:48.276]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:48.596 --> 01:51:51.438]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:51.779 --> 01:51:53.680]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:54.921]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:54.941 --> 01:51:55.121]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:55.141 --> 01:51:58.084]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:58.584 --> 01:52:00.345]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:11.397 --> 01:52:16.721]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:17.201 --> 01:52:24.227]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:52:24.787 --> 01:52:30.932]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:31.332 --> 01:52:33.213]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:33.353 --> 01:52:35.755]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:52:35.835 --> 01:52:46.802]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:52:47.423 --> 01:52:48.703]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:49.104 --> 01:52:50.444]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:50.965 --> 01:52:57.209]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:57.865 --> 01:53:05.608]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:53:06.129 --> 01:53:07.269]  The Obama Deception.
[01:53:07.689 --> 01:53:08.970]  The people strike back.
[01:53:11.111 --> 01:53:15.913]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[01:53:19.121 --> 01:53:19.721]  We're good to go!

[01:54:16.854 --> 01:54:18.736]  It's always great having Tex on with us.
[01:54:18.756 --> 01:54:21.179]  We'll have him back on again in the near future.
[01:54:21.199 --> 01:54:22.220]  We've got a few minutes left with him.
[01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:26.905]  I do want to tell you about a few of the sponsors before we have to end this show.
[01:54:27.586 --> 01:54:29.408]  FrontSight.com.
[01:54:29.588 --> 01:54:30.208]  FrontSight.
[01:54:30.349 --> 01:54:36.575]  F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com is the premier firearms training facility in the country.
[01:54:37.496 --> 01:54:39.999]  And it's the biggest, and it's the least expensive.
[01:54:40.019 --> 01:54:41.361]  That's why they're the biggest and the best.
[01:54:42.222 --> 01:54:48.710]  They give you a free XD pistol with your 5-day firearms course and a 30-day state concealed weapons permit.
[01:54:49.391 --> 01:54:51.733]  And the course is 75% off out of the gates.
[01:54:51.814 --> 01:54:53.295]  It's filling up quickly in the fall.
[01:54:53.676 --> 01:54:54.797]  It's out in Pahrump, Nevada.
[01:54:55.626 --> 01:55:00.509]  They have a lot of free courses and tips and free newsletter at FrontSite.com.
[01:55:00.649 --> 01:55:02.671]  Go check this deal out.

[01:55:11.216 --> 01:55:13.398]  FrontSite.com, FrontSite.com.
[01:55:13.898 --> 01:55:16.060]  And lastly, SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:55:25.927 --> 01:55:32.259]  There have been times in American history, pilgrims for example, when seeds are the highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold.
[01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:37.168]  The globalists are buying up seed companies, building big seed banks, hoarding them at the Arctic Circle.
[01:55:38.519 --> 01:55:41.940]  Seeds on the Survival Seed Bank are hand-picked for exceptional germination rates.
[01:55:42.100 --> 01:55:44.440]  Order a couple of seed banks today while you still can.
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:48.901]  SurvivalSeedBank.com or you can always call Solutions from Science at 877-327-0365.
[01:55:48.921 --> 01:55:48.961]  877-327-0365.
[01:55:48.981 --> 01:55:49.761]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:55:49.781 --> 01:55:50.061]  Great folks.
[01:55:50.081 --> 01:55:50.601]  Get involved today.
[01:55:50.621 --> 01:55:51.662]  Alright Tex, amazing interview.
[01:55:51.682 --> 01:55:53.062]  I appreciate you coming on on short notice.
[01:56:03.965 --> 01:56:09.252]  I can't imagine, just at a base level, looking at Haiti, looking at Cuba, looking at Nigeria.
[01:56:09.713 --> 01:56:12.977]  Voodoo is a horrible demon possession religion.
[01:56:13.358 --> 01:56:19.726]  Even if you don't believe in demons, the mental illness, the self-invoking mental illness of going crazy,
[01:56:20.407 --> 01:56:25.630]  And on all the superstition, it turns out Obama's mother-in-law thinks somebody's put a hex on her.
[01:56:26.050 --> 01:56:35.274]  I mean, this is sewage in the streets, chickens running around, medicine men, all this... It's a black magic religion.
[01:56:35.414 --> 01:56:37.215]  I mean, I couldn't think of something more degenerate.
[01:56:38.092 --> 01:56:39.113]  Well, it is degenerate.
[01:56:39.813 --> 01:56:42.134]  And unfortunately, it's a very dangerous religion.
[01:56:42.495 --> 01:56:50.519]  And as I mentioned, there are people who have been murdered through ritual conducted by the Santeria people.
[01:56:51.279 --> 01:56:58.664]  Not to even mention the horror of animals, you know, dogs, cats, and particularly chickens and goats and all of these things.
[01:56:59.324 --> 01:57:02.806]  So, I think... What about the charms Obama carries?
[01:57:03.718 --> 01:57:09.440]  The charms, the talismans, all of these things are involved in every way, this African tribalism.
[01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:12.361]  And unfortunately, it is taking hold.
[01:57:12.681 --> 01:57:14.481]  It's been in America for a long time.
[01:57:14.521 --> 01:57:25.825]  You remember even Desi Ornez, who's very unfortunate, the most lovable guy in the world on I Love Lucy, but he would always play his drums and he would cry out, Babaluwa!
[01:57:26.365 --> 01:57:29.646]  That's the name of one of the Orishas, the gods.
[01:57:30.745 --> 01:57:32.047]  Uh, of Santeria!
[01:57:32.327 --> 01:57:34.010]  He was calling on the devil god!
[01:57:34.752 --> 01:57:42.806]  Uh, and biographers have shown that Desi Ornez was an alcoholic, and he attempted to get Lucille Ball into a form of satanic worship.
[01:57:43.556 --> 01:57:55.826]  So again, we have a long train of this, but now we have a man in the White House whose mother-in-law actually has conducted, evidently, according to reports, a voodoo ritual.
[01:57:55.966 --> 01:58:00.350]  That's basically what it is, although Santeria say, oh, we're not voodooists, but they are.
[01:58:00.750 --> 01:58:04.433]  Spirits, devils, talismans, charms in the White House.
[01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:08.661]  All right, Tex, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:58:08.681 --> 01:58:20.786]  I hope folks will get Mysterious Monuments, and of course, Codex Magic of Boat, and all your other great books and videos and films at InfoWars.com or TexMars.com or PowerOfProphecy.com.
[01:58:21.106 --> 01:58:22.406]  Tex, thank you so much.
[01:58:22.426 --> 01:58:26.728]  Have a great week, and say hi to Wanda and the rest of the Power of Prophecy crew.
[01:58:27.088 --> 01:58:29.309]  Hey, thank you, Alex, and all the best to you and your audience.
[01:58:29.349 --> 01:58:29.749]  God bless.
[01:58:30.029 --> 01:58:30.509]  God bless you.
[01:58:30.549 --> 01:58:30.930]  Take care.
[01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:33.151]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:33.211 --> 01:58:40.016]  Retransmission jam-packed with tons of news and info and Dr. Blaylock on the forced flu vaccine and what it really does to you.
[01:58:40.296 --> 01:58:42.338]  Coming up right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:42.558 --> 01:58:43.438]  Great job, crew.
[01:58:43.659 --> 01:58:44.819]  See you back tomorrow.
[01:58:44.999 --> 01:58:48.122]  More big guests coming up this week on the heels of Buzz Aldrin.
[01:58:52.665 --> 01:58:54.726]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:55.267 --> 01:58:57.268]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:01.223 --> 01:59:03.826]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:59:04.246 --> 01:59:09.211]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:59:09.571 --> 01:59:11.313]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:11.613 --> 01:59:16.438]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:16.618 --> 01:59:17.519]  How much do you want?
[01:59:17.779 --> 01:59:18.540]  When do you want it?
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:20.521]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:20.801 --> 01:59:21.622]  When will you need it?
[01:59:21.882 --> 01:59:23.943]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:24.083 --> 01:59:25.184]  Will there be any food?
[01:59:25.404 --> 01:59:26.745]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:59:26.945 --> 01:59:32.009]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:59:32.209 --> 01:59:35.391]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:59:35.791 --> 01:59:39.254]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:59:39.614 --> 01:59:40.595]  How much will you need?
[01:59:40.835 --> 01:59:41.436]  We don't know.
[01:59:41.736 --> 01:59:42.656]  How much do you want?
[01:59:42.857 --> 01:59:43.577]  All you can get.
[01:59:43.777 --> 01:59:44.638]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:44.858 --> 01:59:47.620]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:47.921 --> 01:59:49.682]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:49.702 --> 01:59:50.743]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:50.783 --> 01:59:51.864]  Direct to you and in your face.
[01:59:51.884 --> 01:59:54.866]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
