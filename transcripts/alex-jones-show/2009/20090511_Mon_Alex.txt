[00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:15.854]  It is the 11th day of May 2009.
[00:00:16.194 --> 00:00:19.635]  We've got one hour and 52 minutes left with us.
[00:00:19.755 --> 00:00:21.175]  Paul Watson joins us.
[00:00:21.676 --> 00:00:29.578]  When Paul leaves us, I'm going to detail state governments, local governments, the feds moving against the Second Amendment and the First Amendment.
[00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:33.241]  I always try to explain that to the controlled left.
[00:00:34.382 --> 00:00:37.722]  That you take somebody's second amendment, you're going to lose your first amendment.
[00:00:38.462 --> 00:00:40.903]  And I always try to explain that to the controlled right.
[00:00:41.363 --> 00:00:43.563]  You take somebody's first amendment, they're going to take your second.
[00:00:44.363 --> 00:00:45.704]  And they're going to take your property rights.
[00:00:46.704 --> 00:00:47.544]  Under the 10th and the 9th.
[00:00:47.644 --> 00:00:50.024]  They're going to violate those, and that's now happening.
[00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:57.766]  House bill aims to strip right-wing extremists of second amendment rights.
[00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.728]  And boy, is this an accurate article by Kurt Nimmo.
[00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:04.151]  Hard to believe, but it's really happening.
[00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:06.993]  Also saying hurting somebody's feelings to be a felony.
[00:01:07.574 --> 00:01:16.663]  I got a bunch of other economic news and some torture news as well that we're going to be going over here.
[00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.751]  But right now, I wanted to go to Paul Watson.
[00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:25.533]  In fact, it's one of the top stories up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:25.553 --> 00:01:29.095]  Maybe we'll punch that up for folks.
[00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:37.400]  And it deals with the founding of the European Union by Nazis.
[00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:39.541]  Now, this is no secret.
[00:01:39.581 --> 00:01:43.444]  We actually cover this in Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:01:44.824 --> 00:01:46.706]  But the founding members of Bilderberg
[00:01:47.568 --> 00:01:47.708]  I think?
[00:02:02.313 --> 00:02:10.600]  That humans are the enemy and that the world government must be convened and set up to carry out the controlled extermination of the majority of the population.
[00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:12.282]  Now, I'm not the one saying this.
[00:02:12.302 --> 00:02:13.323]  They're the ones saying it.
[00:02:14.404 --> 00:02:17.487]  The Nazis killed tens of millions of people.
[00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:23.452]  That war killed 20 million Germans, at least 20 million Russians, a million Americans and Brits.
[00:02:26.434 --> 00:02:34.480]  And you have to remember, the King of England, Edward VIII, had to advocate the throne because it came out he was a Nazi, photos of him with Hitler, supporting Hitler.
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:51.253]  When the war started, he had to run out of Spain, and basically was told to get out of town and go to the British Virgin Islands, and he basically left for the war a disgrace, and was no longer the King, because he was a big Nazi, and this was all a setup.
[00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:52.134]  Hitler was told
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.721]  You're going to attack the communists, you're going to take over France.
[00:02:56.222 --> 00:03:03.005]  They had a deal with the Vichy French, this is on record, where the British military would evacuate out to Dunkirk.
[00:03:03.686 --> 00:03:12.491]  Hitler would just act like he was attacking them, this has now been declassified, and drop, have Hermann Goering have the Waffe bomb out to sea far away from the ships.
[00:03:13.251 --> 00:03:16.533]  And the film reels got released and they said, Hitler's not attacking.
[00:03:17.153 --> 00:03:22.097]  Then the documents have come out, and it's even on PBS, that Hitler, quote, didn't want to attack the British.
[00:03:22.317 --> 00:03:23.057]  Well, they had a deal.
[00:03:23.778 --> 00:03:26.140]  Then suddenly the British announced, we are going to attack you.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.901]  I mean, talk about conspiracy theories.
[00:03:27.961 --> 00:03:30.042]  It's not a conspiracy theory, it's a conspiracy fact.
[00:03:30.623 --> 00:03:37.128]  But the Maginot Line and all of that didn't fail in World War II.
[00:03:38.866 --> 00:03:42.228]  And Hitler's blitzkrieg was not the great success.
[00:03:42.248 --> 00:03:46.711]  I mean, the Polish held out just defending one city for many days.
[00:03:47.271 --> 00:03:51.014]  And they had horse-drawn carriages and people fighting tanks with swords.
[00:03:51.974 --> 00:03:54.416]  The French had a modern military.
[00:03:55.456 --> 00:04:00.700]  The Vichy French dominated the entire military and most of the French government.
[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.721]  And they wanted a coup of France.
[00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:05.863]  That's why Hitler took over in a week
[00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:18.536]  Came and did a tour of Paris and then left and then they moved the capital down to the city of Vichy, hence it gets the name the Vichy French government.
[00:04:19.216 --> 00:04:20.497]  They were the collaborators.
[00:04:20.537 --> 00:04:21.497]  It was all staged.
[00:04:22.278 --> 00:04:32.644]  It was meant to be a European Union takeover by Hitler and he would take over Europe and then he would unify Europe as the new Germania to attack
[00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:39.372]  The Russians and the Bolsheviks, and then exterminate most of them.
[00:04:39.772 --> 00:04:42.433]  They were going to do blood tests and other genotypes.
[00:04:43.653 --> 00:04:47.075]  And they had other quack systems of measuring the skull and nose and things.
[00:04:47.755 --> 00:04:51.396]  Of all the Slavs, and those that were Aryan enough would live, the rest would be killed.
[00:04:52.576 --> 00:04:56.978]  Hitler wouldn't bomb once he got betrayed, quote, by the British.
[00:04:58.376 --> 00:05:14.006]  He wouldn't bomb London, and he gave speeches saying this is the most pure Aryans there are because they weren't overrun as much as Germany was, you know, by the Mongols in some of those invasions that went on even into Western Europe.
[00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:26.653]  And so, I don't want to bomb and kill any of our precious Aryans, and so England flew it right into Berlin and bombed it just to get Hitler to attack, and then he did.
[00:05:27.253 --> 00:05:30.114]  But the whole thing is it was a betrayal in quotes.
[00:05:30.154 --> 00:05:32.414]  This is all on record in mainline history books.
[00:05:34.455 --> 00:05:38.016]  They just don't make a big deal out of it on TV, but you get a piece of it here, a piece of it there.
[00:05:39.522 --> 00:06:03.281]  And that's why the Deputy Fuhrer, Rudolf Hess, flew in, you know, he'd been a World War I fighter ace, he flew in on his own plane, parachuted in with all these magical amulets saying, I have the peace treaty, I have the secret deal, you weren't supposed to attack us, you were supposed to let us take Europe, and then, you know, the King of England was going to rule it all, you know, with Hitler being the political leader and Edward VIII being the, you know, the sovereign leader.
[00:06:04.844 --> 00:06:10.128]  And they were going to have the Vatican as the new religious center reborn.
[00:06:10.148 --> 00:06:12.250]  And that was what was in the documents.
[00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.552]  And we covered that to some extent in Endgame.
[00:06:15.814 --> 00:06:23.238]  And then, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, a German prince, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, related to the Queen, Anne Edward VIII closely.
[00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:34.104]  He was a Nazi, so then, when they decided to switch and have the House of Orange fight against the Nazis, they had him at a photo-op with a machine gun, shooting at Luftwaffe planes as they came in.
[00:06:34.605 --> 00:06:45.611]  He then ran across the channel, joined the RAF, was good buddies with Prince Philip, the eugenicist as well, who says, you know, blacks aren't humans and get rid of them.
[00:06:48.356 --> 00:07:05.121]  And then you have the eugenics set up in England and the United States that Hitler quotes in Mein Kampf, and quotes in all these speeches, and giving awards to Thomas Watson of IBM, and Margaret Sanger, and the Colgates, and others, and them giving him awards, and, you know, different industrialists in the U.S.
[00:07:05.161 --> 00:07:12.763]  giving Hitler, you know, gifts of two million dollars in gold bars, and just, oh, my, Hitler on the cover of Time magazine.
[00:07:12.783 --> 00:07:14.804]  In fact, pull up Hitler on the cover of Time, 1938.
[00:07:17.705 --> 00:07:18.365]  I think it's the year.
[00:07:18.505 --> 00:07:38.598]  Oh, how great Hitler is, and how wonderful he is, and, you know, at the Olympic Games before that, how he was the savior of the world, and gonna save the environment, and a vegetarian, and for the animals, and biospheres, and eugenics, and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, fully funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:07:38.798 --> 00:07:40.099]  That's all mainline history!
[00:07:44.158 --> 00:07:52.720]  And let me tell you, folks, when I cover this is when I get the death threats and the calls and they turn the Nazis loose on us, claiming we work for Israel and all this other bull.
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.521]  No, I come on air and admit Israel's part and parcel funded by these people.
[00:07:57.021 --> 00:08:05.563]  Israel took billions of dollars to irradiate 110,000 Jewish children, most of them to death, the ringworm children, mainstream.
[00:08:06.003 --> 00:08:10.924]  You know, and at the top, it's the top Zionists took money from
[00:08:13.373 --> 00:08:21.179]  From Jews trying to get out and did deals where Jews couldn't run to New York or London, where they had to go to Palestine and they had to pay the Zionist groups a million bucks to get out of Germany?
[00:08:21.479 --> 00:08:22.860]  Show people Hitler right here!
[00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:26.042]  I'm telling you, at the top, it's all controlled by these people.
[00:08:26.363 --> 00:08:27.684]  There he is, Time Magazine.
[00:08:28.364 --> 00:08:29.685]  Here, scroll down and read the caption.
[00:08:29.885 --> 00:08:30.546]  It says, Hitler.
[00:08:32.547 --> 00:08:33.208]  I can't read that.
[00:08:33.248 --> 00:08:35.109]  I know you can pull up the actual article.
[00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:37.891]  In fact, just pull up
[00:08:39.434 --> 00:08:45.341]  I mean, there's gardening magazines, Time Life, Time Magazine.
[00:08:45.361 --> 00:08:47.463]  Oh, Hitler, he's so great.
[00:08:47.764 --> 00:08:48.645]  My grandfather...
[00:08:54.119 --> 00:09:00.084]  remembers listening in Dallas, Texas in the thirties to Hitler speeches.
[00:09:00.745 --> 00:09:02.646]  And they were translating them and how great he was.
[00:09:03.087 --> 00:09:06.810]  He remembers listening to WBAP and he's dead now.
[00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:07.851]  I'd love to have him on there.
[00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:13.255]  And he remembers hearing the Hitler speeches and how great Hitler was.
[00:09:13.275 --> 00:09:14.476]  Yeah, there it is, man of the year.
[00:09:16.098 --> 00:09:16.678]  Adolf Hitler, 1938.
[00:09:20.834 --> 00:09:22.075]  It talks about how great he is.
[00:09:23.276 --> 00:09:23.937]  God, print that for me.
[00:09:23.957 --> 00:09:24.758]  Maybe I'll read some of that.
[00:09:25.178 --> 00:09:26.479]  You know, this is what I'm telling you.
[00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:31.304]  Alright, I'm going to go to Paul Watson, then we're going to get to your calls and all the attacks on free speech that are happening.
[00:09:32.637 --> 00:09:41.039]  But I'm telling you, I don't care if they're Chinese, I don't care if they're Jewish, if they're German, if they're British, if they're Venezuelan, Nicaraguan, Japanese.
[00:09:41.139 --> 00:09:42.699]  The Japanese were huge into eugenics.
[00:09:42.719 --> 00:09:44.920]  They loved Hitler, the Japanese leadership.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.721]  Elites all believe in breeding and that they're the master group.
[00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:56.183]  And I'm telling you, they're not Catholics, they're not Protestants, they're not Jews, they're not any of this at the top.
[00:09:58.083 --> 00:10:00.684]  They are eugenicists, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:15.196]  My dad had a famous botanist who was a Jewish professor at UT who was the head of the group when my dad was in high school already at UT and this advanced placement thing who they then of the 125 smartest pulled aside six
[00:10:17.577 --> 00:10:33.304]  And it was Professor Speer running it, and he was Jewish, explaining to them about the master race and all of this, but that Hitler just went too far, and that there are really master strains in most groups, and that they've got to cull the people, basically.
[00:10:36.366 --> 00:10:38.447]  I mean, it's everything, everywhere.
[00:10:38.507 --> 00:10:41.108]  This is what the elites believe, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:48.960]  And so, if we don't face the full magnitude of what's happening, it's only going to get worse.
[00:10:49.581 --> 00:10:53.764]  So I go to Paul Watson now with these big new developments that are up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:10:53.804 --> 00:10:58.228]  And last week he broke when the news came out, which we already knew, but now it's mainstream news, people can't deny it.
[00:10:58.468 --> 00:11:06.855]  With more detail, how Bilderberg brags now in all these papers, they secretly set up the EU, just like we sued and got their documents, they're running the North American Union.
[00:11:07.155 --> 00:11:08.276]  Paul Watson, big news.
[00:11:09.317 --> 00:11:10.618]  Hello Alex, good to be back.
[00:11:11.278 --> 00:11:11.799]  Good to have you here.
[00:11:12.918 --> 00:11:13.959]  Yeah.
[00:11:13.979 --> 00:11:31.186]  First of all, most of what you just talked about regarding the Second World War, Hitler and the Nazis, is all laid out in William Shire's book, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, which was written in the early 60s, which is considered the seminal book on the Third Reich.
[00:11:31.406 --> 00:11:38.770]  And all of this stuff's in there, and yet people treat it with suspicion when we talk about it all these years later.
[00:11:40.815 --> 00:11:42.276]  Yeah, well, stay there, Paul.
[00:11:42.656 --> 00:11:44.217]  Let's break down the new info.
[00:11:44.357 --> 00:11:48.899]  And folks, I'm telling you, they're setting up world government to kill most of you listening right now.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.241]  Most of us are dead if we don't beat these people.
[00:11:52.701 --> 00:11:53.461]  It's us or them.
[00:11:53.882 --> 00:11:54.822]  They run everything.
[00:11:54.882 --> 00:11:55.883]  We better turn that around.
[00:11:55.903 --> 00:11:56.323]  Stay with us.
[00:11:57.614 --> 00:12:09.124]  Today, we cannot afford to ignore the current state of our country, the economy, job layoffs, mass foreclosures, and now we are all at risk of being exposed to this new flu pandemic.
[00:12:09.324 --> 00:12:13.908]  The Center for Disease Control has declared a public health emergency across the United States.
[00:12:14.168 --> 00:12:15.629]  What can you do to prepare yourself?
[00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:17.991]  The answer is ZeroFlu.com.
[00:12:18.291 --> 00:12:21.852]  ZeroFlu.com offers you the very best at air purifiers.
[00:12:22.052 --> 00:12:34.837]  These revolutionary air purifiers protect up to 3,000 square feet of your home and stop 99.9% of airborne allergens, influenza, bacteria, viruses, pollen, dust, pet dander, black mold, MRSA, and more.
[00:12:35.037 --> 00:12:37.238]  Not only from the air, but from all surfaces.
[00:12:37.438 --> 00:12:37.798]  We're good.
[00:12:57.398 --> 00:13:03.625]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:13:04.086 --> 00:13:11.874]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:13:12.215 --> 00:13:17.801]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[00:13:18.112 --> 00:13:20.053]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:13:20.354 --> 00:13:25.117]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:13:25.457 --> 00:13:30.181]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:13:30.681 --> 00:13:34.544]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:13:35.024 --> 00:13:36.045]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:13:36.105 --> 00:13:40.188]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:13:40.628 --> 00:13:41.549]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:13:45.501 --> 00:13:48.062]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:13:48.502 --> 00:13:50.183]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:50.523]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:50.543 --> 00:13:52.964]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:14:03.474 --> 00:14:08.857]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:14:09.338 --> 00:14:15.541]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:14:15.762 --> 00:14:17.663]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:14:17.803 --> 00:14:20.204]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:14:20.264 --> 00:14:31.171]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:14:33.459 --> 00:14:34.740]  It's not about left or right.
[00:14:35.121 --> 00:14:36.522]  It's about a one world government.

[00:14:52.156 --> 00:14:53.317]  The Obama Deception.
[00:14:53.738 --> 00:14:54.919]  The people strike back.
[00:14:57.995 --> 00:14:58.875]  Spring is here.
[00:14:59.115 --> 00:14:59.895]  Growing season.
[00:15:00.095 --> 00:15:02.076]  The economy is not getting any better.
[00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:03.676]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[00:15:03.996 --> 00:15:04.656]  Think about it.
[00:15:04.956 --> 00:15:08.817]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[00:15:09.057 --> 00:15:12.517]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[00:15:12.738 --> 00:15:15.298]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[00:15:15.578 --> 00:15:27.440]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.120]  I think so.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:27.825]  Is your life just going to be filled with ball games and partying and mindless stuff that doesn't matter in the end?
[00:16:28.186 --> 00:16:30.888]  Or do you want to discover the mysteries of the universe?
[00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:38.775]  Do you want to know what it is to truly be human and stand up for goodness and honor and decency and for the innocence
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.883]  You know, the enemy teaches you there is no right and wrong.
[00:16:42.903 --> 00:16:44.144]  They teach you there are no heroes.
[00:16:45.085 --> 00:16:47.107]  But in your gut, you know that's a fraud.
[00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:51.432]  Many of you are not fulfilling your destiny to be heroes.
[00:16:52.253 --> 00:16:53.154]  But you are heroes.
[00:16:54.035 --> 00:16:57.919]  Somebody who puts aside their own petty personal gain to do what's right.
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.023]  And in the end, gains the world.
[00:17:02.264 --> 00:17:04.865]  Those that are willing to lay down their lives, gain their lives.
[00:17:05.365 --> 00:17:08.406]  Those that try to keep their lives and save their lives, lose them.
[00:17:08.887 --> 00:17:14.889]  Because when you've got a bunch of people who are cowardly, huddling and shaking, the tyranny, the wolves come.
[00:17:15.309 --> 00:17:23.892]  When you're ready to fight and stand up and you know what's going on, tyranny evaporates like phantoms at dawn.
[00:17:24.472 --> 00:17:28.454]  Trying to remember the Thomas Jefferson quote about, if you just educate the whole public about liberty,
[00:17:29.585 --> 00:17:29.985]  Okay, well,
[00:17:56.078 --> 00:18:00.219]  What we already knew before these latest documents came out was this.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:07.942]  As everybody knows, the first couple of years of the Second World War, the Nazis blitzed through Europe.
[00:18:07.982 --> 00:18:08.762]  They were on top.
[00:18:08.822 --> 00:18:18.105]  But from the early 1940s onward, the worm had turned and they knew that military defeat was all but certain.
[00:18:18.425 --> 00:18:23.907]  And so they started to devise ways of how they could preserve their power.
[00:18:24.688 --> 00:18:28.190]  Um, by means of consent over conquest.
[00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:49.279]  And it was during this period that top Nazis, such as Nazi economics minister Walter Funk, wrote about the necessity to create, quote, a central European Union and, quote, a European economic area.
[00:18:49.499 --> 00:18:53.961]  That's what Funk called for in his book, The European Community.
[00:18:55.077 --> 00:19:03.687]  As well as him, his co-authors, Nazi academic Heinrich Hunker wrote in the same book, quote,
[00:19:17.116 --> 00:19:22.446]  Fellow Nazi Gustav Koenig wrote, quote, we have a real European community task before us.
[00:19:22.626 --> 00:19:26.192]  I am convinced that this community effort will last beyond the end of the war.
[00:19:27.426 --> 00:19:34.269]  And that's why they always say that the European Union, the engine of it is Germany, because the German taxpayers pay for it all.
[00:19:34.329 --> 00:19:41.411]  It's because you've got Crump Industries and all of these guys who are right up there on par with the Rothschilds and others in the power structure.
[00:19:41.872 --> 00:19:47.854]  They literally suck all the money out of the German people to buy off the rest of Europe for themselves.
[00:19:47.914 --> 00:19:49.915]  It's just an economic domination.
[00:19:50.775 --> 00:19:51.035]  Right.
[00:19:51.735 --> 00:19:55.517]  And then following the release of this book,
[00:19:56.253 --> 00:20:11.542]  Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels ordered the creation of, quote, large-scale economic unification of Europe, believing that, quote, in 50 years time people would no longer think in terms of countries.
[00:20:12.383 --> 00:20:22.269]  This was in 1940, and in 1993, just 53 years later, the European Union in its current form was born.
[00:20:24.215 --> 00:20:31.899]  And Paul, that's why they're an irresistible force until you consciously realize what they're doing because they move like a glacier.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.901]  I mean, it's just that irresistible force.
[00:20:34.981 --> 00:20:36.402]  I'm going to twist you.
[00:20:36.422 --> 00:20:40.284]  I'm going to take my time butchering you real good.
[00:20:40.744 --> 00:20:47.968]  And the general public's thinking on a day-to-day, and the global masterminds, they're thinking on 50-year models.
[00:20:48.008 --> 00:20:48.428]  Go ahead.
[00:20:49.329 --> 00:20:49.649]  Right.
[00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:51.370]  It's a long-term agenda.
[00:20:52.723 --> 00:21:15.895]  Other top Nazis who also called for the creation of a pan-European federal economic super-state were Ribbentrop, Quisling and Stijs Inquart, who he spoke for, quote, the new Europe of solidarity and cooperation among all its people will find rapidly increasing prosperity once national economic boundaries are removed.
[00:21:16.852 --> 00:21:22.936]  And that could have been taken straight out of a CFR meeting or a Trilateral Commission meeting or whatever.
[00:21:23.456 --> 00:21:38.866]  So you've got all these top Nazis in the early 40s saying we need a pan-European economic empire and we need to do it by consent rather than conquest and then we'll get on to the new documents which only solidify that this was second place after the break.
[00:21:39.488 --> 00:21:40.229]  Yeah, it's no doubt.
[00:21:40.289 --> 00:21:46.714]  The entire European Union, to be the center of the new world government, as Wharton Brown has said, is to carry out Nazi policies of mass death.
[00:21:47.655 --> 00:21:48.556]  We're on the march.
[00:21:49.036 --> 00:21:50.637]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:51.558 --> 00:21:54.401]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:57.703 --> 00:22:07.772]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:22:10.885 --> 00:22:11.285]  I think so.

[00:22:49.377 --> 00:22:51.418]  In the new world orders war against humanity.
[00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.412]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:02.933 --> 00:23:09.921]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:23:10.502 --> 00:23:16.669]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:23:17.089 --> 00:23:18.930]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.472]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:23:21.552 --> 00:23:32.539]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.420]  It's not about left or right.
[00:23:34.821 --> 00:23:36.202]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:23:36.682 --> 00:23:42.886]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:23:51.839 --> 00:23:52.999]  The Obama Deception.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.680]  The people strike back.
[00:23:57.161 --> 00:24:05.904]  IonicZone.com sells virus, bacteria, and mold-killing products that will protect you and your loved ones from airborne pathogens, biological threats, chemtrails, you name it.
[00:24:06.226 --> 00:24:17.832]  For instance, Ionic Zone sells their patented ozone generators from $279, digital water ozonators from $135, and UV-C dual lamp and duct air sanitizers from $279.
[00:24:18.453 --> 00:24:22.495]  Ionic Zone also sells highly effective alternative health products.
[00:24:22.835 --> 00:24:31.420]  For instance, Jim Humble's revolutionary internal virus killing invention, MMS, Miracle Mineral Solution, Canada's nurse Rean Case's Acai XT,
[00:24:32.461 --> 00:24:37.664]  Naturopath recommended Super Zeolite for heavy metal detox, even an ozone handheld bidet.
[00:24:37.924 --> 00:24:41.626]  If you're interested in natural healing, you'll love what Ionic Zone has to offer.
[00:24:41.906 --> 00:24:46.069]  Ionic Zone also offers free home business opportunities that will make you well over $1,000 a month.

[00:25:08.638 --> 00:25:14.219]  It's hard to believe that reality is what it is, but that doesn't change the facts.
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:26.843]  We are in a scientific dictatorship, and they are now moving to shut down free speech and resisting them verbally and physically.
[00:25:28.023 --> 00:25:35.425]  While they built the overall structure and bankrupted the societies to make us independent, to make those of us that were independent dependent on them,
[00:25:38.083 --> 00:25:40.705]  They now move into the final phase of the hot war.
[00:25:42.226 --> 00:25:43.306]  Or the physical tyranny.
[00:25:44.167 --> 00:25:45.227]  And that is now upon us.
[00:25:45.748 --> 00:25:46.648]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:25:46.708 --> 00:25:49.170]  Okay, Paul wants to continue with these articles you've got.
[00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.972]  We're Bilderberg Groups now in the news bragging, okay, we set it all up.
[00:25:53.272 --> 00:25:54.593]  Yeah, we really do run things.
[00:25:55.173 --> 00:25:57.395]  And yeah, by the way, we're eugenicists.
[00:25:58.275 --> 00:26:00.957]  And this is what we want to carry out against the world population.
[00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:02.390]  Right.
[00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:05.551]  I'll get to the Bilderberg connection in a second.
[00:26:05.611 --> 00:26:07.092]  Yeah, continue with the Nazis.
[00:26:07.112 --> 00:26:11.333]  So they're saying by 4142, and this was always the rumor.
[00:26:11.573 --> 00:26:14.834]  Well, no, people had read history books that had the documents.
[00:26:15.675 --> 00:26:23.497]  When they would tell people, then folks would say, I heard, and then it became a rumor that, oh, there was a secret Nazi plan to go underground.
[00:26:23.817 --> 00:26:25.258]  The crypto eugenicists.
[00:26:25.298 --> 00:26:25.658]  Go ahead.
[00:26:26.946 --> 00:26:36.493]  Yeah, so by 4142 they were saying it was necessary to roll their failing military agenda into a pan-European economic agenda.
[00:26:37.433 --> 00:26:50.022]  And the new revelations are that an author who was writing a book called Adam Labor was collecting material for a fictional book based around the premise that
[00:26:50.928 --> 00:27:07.701]  Nazis who were seeking to preserve their power and their money at the end of the Second World War conspired to create a Fourth Reich using the infiltration of creating a European Union, which we just talked about.
[00:27:08.582 --> 00:27:16.968]  And in researching and collecting material for this book, because obviously all such books are based loosely on historical fact,
[00:27:17.714 --> 00:27:22.515]  He actually discovered documents which directly proved the plot to be true.
[00:27:23.735 --> 00:27:26.296]  And, uh, this document is called U.S.
[00:27:26.336 --> 00:27:33.057]  Military Intelligence Report EWPA-128, and it's also known as the Red House Report.
[00:27:33.897 --> 00:27:45.380]  And in that document, it talks about how top Nazis met in Strasbourg, France, in 1944, knowing that they were about to lose the war, obviously.
[00:27:46.061 --> 00:27:56.089]  And they conspired to create a fourth Reich based on a pan-European economic empire and a European common market.
[00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:15.205]  And what the plan consisted of was top Nazi SS officers like Dr. Schied ordered wealthy Nazi industrialists and bankers to set up front companies abroad and pose as reformed Democrats
[00:28:15.836 --> 00:28:23.939]  So that they could achieve economic penetration throughout Europe and ultimately lay the foundations for the re-emergence of the Nazis.
[00:28:25.299 --> 00:28:36.783]  Now this consisted primarily of people like Alfred Krupp of Krupp Industries and Friedrich Flick according to these documents as well as front companies
[00:28:37.526 --> 00:28:37.786]  that we
[00:28:57.657 --> 00:29:08.560]  Infiltrating the European business market and creating this foundation for the Nazi ideology to persist even after they were defeated militarily.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:25.705]  And we've got a quote in the article from historian Michael Pinto-Duchinsky, who said, quote, for many leading industrial figures close to the Nazi regime, Europe became a cover for pursuing German national interest after the defeat of Hitler.
[00:29:26.198 --> 00:29:31.359]  The continuity of the economy of Germany and the economies of post-war Europe is striking.
[00:29:31.939 --> 00:29:37.500]  Some of the leading figures in the Nazi economy became leading builders of the European Union."
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.601]  End quote.
[00:29:39.521 --> 00:29:44.102]  Now, the key man in all this is somebody called Hermann Abs.
[00:29:44.922 --> 00:29:46.322]  Surname ABS.
[00:29:47.002 --> 00:29:49.843]  Now, he was known as Hitler's top banker.
[00:29:50.663 --> 00:29:54.504]  And in fact, David Rockefeller, let me get the direct quote,
[00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:59.152]  Called Abs the greatest banker of the 20th century.
[00:29:59.953 --> 00:30:13.661]  Now Abs was on the board of Deutsche Bank when the Nazis rose to prominence in the 1930s and he also held no less than 40 directorships in Nazi companies during that same period.
[00:30:14.001 --> 00:30:24.627]  He was also on the board of IG Farben who of course made the Zyklon B gas, held the patent to it which was used to kill the concentration camp victims.
[00:30:25.603 --> 00:30:36.130]  He was also put in charge of allocating martial aid reconstruction funds, so he basically managed Germany's economic recovery after the war.
[00:30:36.751 --> 00:30:48.879]  Now where it gets even more interesting is the fact that Abbs was a founding member of the European League for Economic Cooperation, which was set up in 1946.
[00:30:48.919 --> 00:30:54.763]  Now just by coincidence, the other people who helped him set this up
[00:30:55.385 --> 00:31:00.346]  And this European League for Economic Cooperation still exists today.
[00:31:00.486 --> 00:31:06.807]  It was one of the primary drivers behind the eventual creation of the European Economic Market in 1957.
[00:31:06.967 --> 00:31:15.669]  It still exists today and it has an advisory status at the Council of Europe and on the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
[00:31:16.089 --> 00:31:21.551]  So this was a key organisation in setting the foundation for the creation of the European Union.
[00:31:22.291 --> 00:31:23.571]  It was set up by ABS.
[00:31:24.375 --> 00:31:34.081]  A top Nazi, Hitler's top banker, and, I might add, a Bilderberg member, when the Bilderberg organisation came into existence just before 1954.
[00:31:36.282 --> 00:31:52.872]  Also, people who helped abset up this European League for Economic Cooperation were, among others, Edmund Giscard d'Estaing, top Bilderberg member, Paul van Zeeland, top Bilderberg member,
[00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:54.351]  I don't
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.162]  Forming this European League for Economic Cooperation in 1946.
[00:32:13.362 --> 00:32:33.895]  And then you have Bilderberg bragging in public documents to the BBC and others, to the EU Observer a few weeks ago, Vice Count Etienne d'Avignon, who we personally videotaped last year in DC and then again before that in Canada, in Ottawa at the Brook Street,
[00:32:35.593 --> 00:32:39.507]  They brag that they covertly set this up and they're proud of themselves and you've got...
[00:32:40.489 --> 00:32:49.272]  Prince Bernard, the SS member, who is the founder of the others you just mentioned, setting all of this up.
[00:32:49.332 --> 00:32:57.975]  I mean, it's totally there, and then all they push is eugenics and bankrupting the middle class, and then people say, well, they're Nazis and they want whites to breed.
[00:32:58.475 --> 00:32:58.715]  No!
[00:32:58.875 --> 00:33:06.858]  Then they fund these programs to have the West not have children as the West dies, and they have all these Bilderberg Group members and Club of Rome people come out.
[00:33:07.518 --> 00:33:13.101]  And say that they want to cut the population of Australia, England in half, Canada in half, U.S.
[00:33:13.141 --> 00:33:13.461]  in half.
[00:33:14.101 --> 00:33:20.084]  And when you read their eugenicist documents for all the white supremacists out there thinking, we like the new world order then.
[00:33:20.305 --> 00:33:20.985]  No you don't!
[00:33:21.645 --> 00:33:32.531]  Because what you have to understand is they say that they tell the public about positive and negative eugenicists, who they see as the master race, needs to interbreed and make smarter, faster, better, longer lived.
[00:33:33.601 --> 00:33:42.348]  More stable people and then negative eugenics, sterilize or kill or get rid of or starve the sub-humans in their twisted view.
[00:33:43.268 --> 00:33:44.629]  But they say that's for the public.
[00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:58.820]  What we want is to actually get rid of our competition that are the whites and Jews and a few other groups, including some of the higher orientals as they call them, that they want world government to knock out their competition.
[00:33:59.841 --> 00:34:01.542]  Again, I'm not even saying I believe in all this.
[00:34:01.602 --> 00:34:02.963]  I'm stating what they believe.
[00:34:03.444 --> 00:34:10.749]  How evil is that to want to kill their own race because they believe it's a master race that threatens them?
[00:34:10.769 --> 00:34:15.112]  I mean, these are some sick, sick puppies, man.
[00:34:15.152 --> 00:34:20.316]  These are some sick, sick, sick, sick, sick people, Paul.
[00:34:22.157 --> 00:34:22.418]  Right.
[00:34:22.678 --> 00:34:28.282]  And knowing the origins of their ideology, it's no surprise, because as you mentioned,
[00:34:29.392 --> 00:34:36.858]  Okay, we've got top Nazis and future Bilderbergers creating this European Economic Group in 1946.
[00:34:37.959 --> 00:34:52.490]  By the early 50s, when they start to meet and plan all this through the Bilderberg Group, they start talking about, quote, pressing need to bring the German people together with the other peoples of Europe into a common market.
[00:34:53.371 --> 00:34:56.633]  And these documents came out of the 1955 Bilderberg meeting
[00:34:59.249 --> 00:35:04.310]  Documents which are now being released by the WikiLeaks website, which we reported on last week.
[00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:12.112]  So in 55, they're talking about creating a European Common Market, but not by the creation of a new authority.
[00:35:12.152 --> 00:35:16.693]  They said it's got to be done via a treaty, otherwise we're not going to get it done.
[00:35:17.153 --> 00:35:28.776]  So lo and behold, two years later, 1957, the first incarnation of the European Union, the European Economic Community, is passed via the Rome Treaty.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:40.590]  Also, in the 55 Bilderberg documents, it talks about, quote, it might be better to proceed through the development of common market by treaty.
[00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:41.391]  I've talked about that.
[00:35:41.812 --> 00:35:46.316]  It also talks about the need to create a single European currency.
[00:35:47.337 --> 00:35:50.100]  And this is in 1955.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.544]  The single European currency was only proposed
[00:35:55.889 --> 00:35:58.330]  In 1992, that's when it was first proposed.
[00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:03.074]  And by the way, I'll make this point I make routinely, Paul, this is so important, we'll go back to what you were just saying.
[00:36:03.694 --> 00:36:19.906]  Remember in 2007, in all the capital cities of Europe, they had giant parades for 50 years of the Euro, and people, nobody showed up, and it was empty streets, and they said, for all the fireworks displays and parades, they said, but we thought this thing just started in 2000.
[00:36:21.047 --> 00:36:23.428]  How is it 50 years of the Euro?
[00:36:23.868 --> 00:36:26.430]  And that's because of the Treaty of Rome in 1957.
[00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:33.453]  You had the European Union, just like with the treaty they had in Waco in 2005, in March.
[00:36:34.593 --> 00:36:36.734]  And they said the treaty was secret, but people sued and got it.
[00:36:37.075 --> 00:36:42.897]  We are now in the North American Union, and down the road they'll announce, you know, 20 years of the North American Union.
[00:36:42.917 --> 00:36:45.098]  People go, but I thought this started last year.
[00:36:45.118 --> 00:36:46.859]  And they'll be, it didn't, slave.
[00:36:47.299 --> 00:36:48.300]  So please continue, Paul.
[00:36:50.031 --> 00:37:01.700]  Yeah, they actually had another EU ceremony in Paris last year when I was in Paris, and they had EU flags on top of the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:10.166]  Nobody seemed very interested in it, but it was just a statement, you know, we own this, this is ours, and that's what they do with EU flags everywhere now.
[00:37:10.747 --> 00:37:16.291]  But going back to what I was talking about, yeah, they proposed the euro in 1955, and that's
[00:37:20.015 --> 00:37:28.421]  42, sorry, it's around about 40 years before it was actually first proposed and introduced.
[00:37:29.302 --> 00:37:46.456]  And so, you've got a straight line between the Nazis, the creation of these groups which laid the foundations for the EU, then the Bilderberg Group, which is when they formalized the policies to create the EU and the Euro,
[00:37:47.023 --> 00:38:01.215]  And then the creation of the EEC in 1957, and then obviously in the decades since, the EEC got bigger and bigger and eventually became the European Union in 1993.
[00:38:01.875 --> 00:38:11.183]  And in the 21st century, now we have the European Union basically laying everything out on the table and not even hiding behind
[00:38:12.614 --> 00:38:37.511]  This rationalization that it's just a trading partnership and they've proposed now with the Lisbon Treaty basically to take away any remaining sovereignty whatsoever held by nation states and create a truly federal European super state and the origins of it have now been proven vehemently
[00:38:38.257 --> 00:38:42.501]  Can be found with Nazis and Nazi ideology.
[00:38:43.442 --> 00:38:48.666]  And other Bilderberg Group documents have leaked and we can publicly see the policies of the European Union.
[00:38:49.107 --> 00:38:52.169]  They claim if you're not for open borders you're a racist.
[00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:57.214]  So they always use the attack of what they themselves really are.
[00:38:58.328 --> 00:39:00.089]  And so that's what's so cold-blooded about this.
[00:39:00.129 --> 00:39:01.830]  Take the Royal Commission on Population, 1949.
[00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:09.874]  It states if we industrialize the third world, they'll stop having as many children, but that won't give us as much power.
[00:39:10.154 --> 00:39:15.317]  So we'll keep policies in the third world with the IMF and World Bank to bankrupt them.
[00:39:15.797 --> 00:39:17.058]  They'll have more children.
[00:39:17.438 --> 00:39:22.481]  It'll actually chew up the rainforest and the indigenous animals.
[00:39:23.769 --> 00:39:29.210]  But that's okay, because later we'll come in with other sterilization programs and just call off the mass.
[00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:36.031]  So we'll use a population bomb as a weapon, and then we'll come in and use a eugenics operation against those people.
[00:39:36.651 --> 00:39:44.673]  I mean, this is a scorched earth policy of, we'll screw everything up, we'll destroy half the planet if we need to, to get this system in control.
[00:39:44.993 --> 00:39:50.634]  We'll GMO all the crops, if that's what it takes to take over the third world populations and destroy their crops.
[00:39:51.374 --> 00:39:57.778]  I mean, again, it's just such a diabolical design that they run.
[00:39:57.798 --> 00:40:02.020]  And then we see the Club of Rome and the CFR and these European Union groups.
[00:40:02.721 --> 00:40:10.125]  Openly, it's always about eugenics and getting rid of the middle class and bankrupting the population and doing all these horrible things.
[00:40:11.246 --> 00:40:12.747]  It is just so cold-blooded.
[00:40:13.936 --> 00:40:14.617]  Paul Watson.
[00:40:30.954 --> 00:40:38.716]  Manifestation of what the Milner Group developed to tear up Europe so then again the Anglo-American establishment could come in as the savior.
[00:40:38.976 --> 00:40:45.919]  See, the Anglo-American establishment can't come into the Middle East unless they fund radical Muslims to tear up stuff so they have an excuse.
[00:40:46.499 --> 00:40:54.701]  They can't come into Europe and take over France and the Netherlands and all these other countries unless they can come in and put a Hitler in to do it.
[00:40:55.782 --> 00:40:56.302]  Again, they
[00:40:57.162 --> 00:41:12.452]  They are just masters at engineering these systems and then using the Nazis on the continent and all those funds and treasure they amassed, telling the rich doctors and scientists and the crumps and the elites, join with us now.
[00:41:12.532 --> 00:41:14.433]  Here's the real eugenics plan.
[00:41:14.753 --> 00:41:19.196]  Go underground into a corporate state, which is what Lord Milner wanted in the teens.
[00:41:19.716 --> 00:41:20.137]  Indeed they are.
[00:41:20.157 --> 00:41:24.361]  What we need to remember is that most individuals, most MEPs in the European Union Parliament are not Nazis.
[00:41:44.314 --> 00:42:08.643]  The origins of their organization is, and the very nature of the European Union, in that it seeks to remove power from national governments who are accountable to their citizens, to their electorate, and centralize it into the hands of an elite that are electable to nobody but themselves, is, by its very own nature, totalitarian.
[00:42:08.663 --> 00:42:12.844]  So even if you don't believe that it had Nazi origins, which are now proven,
[00:42:13.696 --> 00:42:16.198]  It's totalitarian by its very nature.
[00:42:17.099 --> 00:42:23.905]  You've got the Lisbon Treaty coming up again in autumn.
[00:42:24.385 --> 00:42:32.232]  Now they can't ratify it without every member state giving the go-ahead and the only one that's opposed it is Ireland because that's the only one.
[00:42:32.822 --> 00:42:35.543]  Apart from a few others that allowed it to go to referendum.
[00:42:35.603 --> 00:42:39.505]  And because Ireland voted no, they're just going to make them vote on it again.
[00:42:39.545 --> 00:42:41.125]  They won't say their pronouncement.
[00:42:41.386 --> 00:42:41.666]  Stay there.
[00:42:41.686 --> 00:42:44.607]  We'll do a final segment with you and then I promise to get through the calls that I've been holding.
[00:42:44.627 --> 00:42:47.688]  Then I'm going to cover the attacks on free speech and news blitz for the rest of the show.
[00:42:47.708 --> 00:42:49.229]  Got a whole other hour coming up.
[00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:53.290]  Key, saving the most important stuff for last coming up.
[00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:56.051]  But I've got some comments I want Paul's covering as well that are very important.
[00:42:56.071 --> 00:42:56.992]  When we get back, stay with us.
[00:42:57.967 --> 00:43:03.451]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:43:03.471 --> 00:43:04.012]  and the world.
[00:43:04.272 --> 00:43:07.734]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:43:08.135 --> 00:43:14.359]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:43:14.639 --> 00:43:16.421]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:43:16.661 --> 00:43:24.607]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:43:24.867 --> 00:43:29.312]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:43:29.572 --> 00:43:35.118]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:43:35.398 --> 00:43:37.400]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.904]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you, free of charge.
[00:43:41.244 --> 00:43:41.565]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[00:43:41.585 --> 00:43:41.645]  1-800-453-2202.
[00:43:41.665 --> 00:43:43.187]  Or visit our website at ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[00:43:43.207 --> 00:43:45.329]  Factory direct, wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.710]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[00:43:57.028 --> 00:43:58.369]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:43:58.549 --> 00:44:03.534]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[00:44:03.914 --> 00:44:05.996]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[00:44:06.337 --> 00:44:15.265]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout
[00:44:15.505 --> 00:44:16.026]  I think so.
[00:44:40.248 --> 00:44:40.528]  We're good.
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:01.884]  The new multipolar inline and portable water system, new from hempusa.org.
[00:45:02.104 --> 00:45:10.491]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source, rendering chemicals harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[00:45:10.731 --> 00:45:15.414]  Imagine a softer, smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system and brain.
[00:45:15.635 --> 00:45:22.180]  There are no filters to buy and it can be taken anywhere, making it our number one new product from hempusa.org.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:28.905]  This water system will descale all piping hot water heaters and appliances due to heavy buildup of hard minerals.
[00:45:29.085 --> 00:45:30.486]  Detoxification may result
[00:45:31.118 --> 00:45:31.418]  I think so.
[00:46:06.917 --> 00:46:15.922]  If you study Adolf Hitler, you'll learn that he believed that everybody should become vegetarians by law.
[00:46:16.782 --> 00:46:18.243]  I'm not attacking vegetarians, folks.
[00:46:18.263 --> 00:46:19.423]  I'm just stating facts here.
[00:46:22.945 --> 00:46:25.886]  That there should be laws against hunting.
[00:46:25.926 --> 00:46:26.887]  He was against hunting.
[00:46:28.648 --> 00:46:32.190]  He was basically more akin to a PETA supporter than anything else.
[00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:34.611]  And he believed in culling humans.
[00:46:36.002 --> 00:46:46.670]  And he believed in keeping small groups of blacks alive in certain areas of Africa, kind of as a zoo, you know, would keep alive elephants or something.
[00:46:47.571 --> 00:46:55.797]  As a laboratory example, he believed that they would let the Japanese dominate and cull the Asian populations.
[00:46:57.238 --> 00:47:05.465]  They were going to take over all of Russia and Central Asia and exterminate everyone who didn't pass muster.
[00:47:07.122 --> 00:47:09.083]  Same thing with most of the Latin American nations.
[00:47:12.064 --> 00:47:13.584]  And this is what they believed in.
[00:47:14.444 --> 00:47:19.926]  Now, when you see things like carbon taxes proposed in the 60s, this comes right out of Club of Rome, right out of Bilderberg Group.
[00:47:20.487 --> 00:47:24.468]  Prince Philip and Prince Bernhard, both Nazis on record.
[00:47:25.668 --> 00:47:33.891]  In fact, Prince Philip, we forget about, the consort, the Duke of Edinburgh to the Queen of England, he was a Nazi.
[00:47:34.671 --> 00:47:36.072]  His sisters all married Nazis.
[00:47:37.168 --> 00:47:38.429]  They're all Nazis.
[00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:39.830]  They're all Nazis.
[00:47:41.211 --> 00:47:44.974]  And you can say what you want about who runs the world and what the system is.
[00:47:45.314 --> 00:47:46.435]  The facts are the facts.
[00:47:47.175 --> 00:47:48.676]  And they are carrying out eugenics.
[00:47:49.277 --> 00:47:53.840]  And Endgame, I think, gives you the best picture to understand that overall.
[00:47:55.121 --> 00:47:56.582]  But in closing, Paul Watson,
[00:48:01.838 --> 00:48:11.770]  They're going forward with their world government plan and I just hope that the white supremacists understand out there that this eugenics model out there is for them as well.
[00:48:13.789 --> 00:48:20.812]  The elites are going after whoever they think actually has genetics that they don't control, that quote, threatens them.
[00:48:21.133 --> 00:48:31.037]  They want to kill the, quote, sub-humans and the, you know, quote, middle class, you know, that they see of genetics that might challenge them.
[00:48:31.798 --> 00:48:33.418]  And I hope people realize that.
[00:48:33.438 --> 00:48:35.199]  I mean, no matter who you are, 99% of us
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.641]  Are in deep trouble under this system.
[00:48:39.021 --> 00:48:41.322]  So we better all come together against the New World Order.
[00:48:41.382 --> 00:48:45.663]  And then, whatever policy the New World Order's got, we should be against that policy.
[00:48:45.683 --> 00:48:46.164]  Paul Watson.
[00:48:47.584 --> 00:48:47.824]  Right.
[00:48:47.924 --> 00:49:01.569]  I also find it interesting to know, from what you were just talking about, that Valerie Giesgaard de Stang, the top Bilderberg member who founded the precursor for the EU with top Nazis, married his cousin.
[00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:04.631]  So they all like to keep it in the family, don't they?
[00:49:04.771 --> 00:49:05.691]  They're really into that.
[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:31.637]  But what I would say about the European Union is that from its ideology in the 40s, from its Nazi ideology to its empowerment in the decades later, now the agenda is so advanced that the manifestations of its power cannot be hidden anymore, which is why people like G-Star Destin said
[00:49:32.398 --> 00:49:42.103]  Regarding the Lisbon Treaty, quote, public opinion will be led to adopt, without knowing it, the proposals we dare not present to them directly.
[00:49:44.104 --> 00:49:44.764]  Imagine that.
[00:49:44.825 --> 00:49:48.727]  So he's saying that basically, if we knew what it was really about, we'd never go for it.
[00:49:48.887 --> 00:49:51.668]  So it's, you know, but now it's coming out.
[00:49:52.388 --> 00:49:54.530]  The free speech issue with the EU.
[00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:59.172]  I mean, the Nazis just killed people who spoke out against them, but
[00:49:59.724 --> 00:50:04.707]  The EU's found a more successful method, which is just kill their free speech instead.
[00:50:05.127 --> 00:50:14.272]  There's actually a European Court of Justice case which establishes the pretext that it's an illegal act to criticize the EU.
[00:50:14.853 --> 00:50:17.394]  In fact, the EU has banned... You know, that's too important.
[00:50:17.414 --> 00:50:17.854]  Stay there.
[00:50:17.895 --> 00:50:26.259]  Let's come back in five more minutes and I promise I'm going to get to one final round of calls from Randy, Ryan, Robert, Randy, Randy.
[00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.541]  Man, I tell you, it's all our callers today.
[00:50:29.938 --> 00:50:33.581]  And then I'm gonna get into all this other free speech attacks and I'll try to go to the beach.
[00:50:33.942 --> 00:50:35.563]  It was Big Brother like you've never seen.
[00:50:35.583 --> 00:50:36.564]  I'll show you those photos.
[00:50:39.046 --> 00:50:41.108]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:41.648 --> 00:50:44.831]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:47.281 --> 00:50:48.842]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:48.962 --> 00:50:53.625]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:50:53.705 --> 00:50:56.466]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:50:56.666 --> 00:50:59.528]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:50:59.708 --> 00:51:05.611]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:51:05.791 --> 00:51:08.673]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:09.033 --> 00:51:15.938]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:51:15.998 --> 00:51:19.140]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:19.500]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:20.841]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[00:51:24.443 --> 00:51:30.528]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:51:30.708 --> 00:51:34.451]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:34.471 --> 00:51:35.812]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:51:35.832 --> 00:51:36.412]  Take action today.
[00:51:36.452 --> 00:51:38.434]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:49.989 --> 00:51:51.890]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:55.311]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:58.892 --> 00:52:01.833]  Wow, we are already into the final hour.
[00:52:01.933 --> 00:52:03.953]  I make my return to the airwaves.
[00:52:04.053 --> 00:52:04.454]  It's 11th May 2009.
[00:52:18.075 --> 00:52:20.377]  Big news bullet's coming up, finishing up with Paul Watson.
[00:52:20.737 --> 00:52:35.367]  Paul Watson, you were getting into, yeah, the European Union's been firing ministers and members of the British government get fired if they criticize the EU, and now I've seen mainstream news articles where people are arrested because they use the word homosexual.
[00:52:35.667 --> 00:52:40.491]  That's a hate crime now because it hurts people's feelings.
[00:52:41.171 --> 00:52:44.253]  If something hurts someone's feelings, even if it's a scientific term,
[00:52:45.715 --> 00:52:46.735]  You said the word bluebird.
[00:52:46.795 --> 00:52:47.556]  That hurts my feelings.
[00:52:47.576 --> 00:52:48.297]  You're under arrest.
[00:52:48.677 --> 00:52:49.858]  They're now proposed a bill.
[00:52:49.878 --> 00:52:53.040]  It's getting a lot of co-sponsors here in the United States doing the same thing.
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:53.761]  That's coming up.
[00:52:54.442 --> 00:52:56.023]  But you were talking about the European Union.
[00:52:56.063 --> 00:52:57.824]  This is all happening.
[00:52:58.104 --> 00:53:02.988]  And now in London I was reading that every day people are getting stopped and questioned.
[00:53:03.008 --> 00:53:03.569]  It's happened to me.
[00:53:03.629 --> 00:53:04.369]  It's happened to your brother.
[00:53:06.631 --> 00:53:11.955]  She's announcing your Home Secretary that there's basically no free speech in England.
[00:53:11.975 --> 00:53:14.076]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[00:53:14.096 --> 00:53:15.297]  I mean, they're really doing this.
[00:53:16.658 --> 00:53:35.710]  Well, the controversy regarding Michael Savage, what was not mentioned in that whole controversy was the fact that he was banned from entering Britain based on an EU law that frames it, you know, political opinions that could be deemed offensive.
[00:53:36.483 --> 00:53:37.204]  Are illegal.
[00:53:37.584 --> 00:53:48.431]  Because it was under the same laws that a Dutch politician who called the Karen fascist, I believe, he was barred from entering Britain as well.
[00:53:48.471 --> 00:53:50.732]  And that's all done under EU laws.
[00:53:50.792 --> 00:53:51.933]  Yeah, I forgot that, Paul.
[00:53:51.953 --> 00:53:52.913]  You gotta get a blurb up.
[00:53:52.933 --> 00:53:53.774]  That's huge news.
[00:53:53.834 --> 00:53:55.395]  Nobody has pointed that out but you.
[00:53:56.335 --> 00:54:04.120]  So, from what I was saying before, the manifestations of the EU's power are now so advanced that they're obviously totalitarian.
[00:54:04.621 --> 00:54:05.321]  I mean, you've got
[00:54:06.563 --> 00:54:24.297]  We've posted pictures on prisonplanet.com where the international EU police, because the EU's now got its own international political police force, is firing tear gas at Serbians who are protesting infringements against their sovereignty.
[00:54:25.456 --> 00:54:29.838]  On behalf of the UN created globalist client state Kosovo.
[00:54:30.218 --> 00:54:41.703]  And it also came out in mainstream news just today, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com that they are doing all sorts of other restrictions on free speech all over Europe.
[00:54:42.563 --> 00:54:44.264]  Yeah, which happens at every major global summit now.
[00:54:44.284 --> 00:54:47.066]  With the free speech, the EU has also attempted to basically ban the internet.
[00:54:47.086 --> 00:54:49.287]  They call it a dangerous and unregulated blogosphere.
[00:55:09.545 --> 00:55:16.091]  I make all these points and I try to make it relevant to people in America because this is exactly what they're planning with the North American Union.
[00:55:16.171 --> 00:55:19.975]  It's going to be set up along the exact same lines and you're going to see
[00:55:22.839 --> 00:55:27.322]  Instead of European International Police, North American Union International Police.
[00:55:53.540 --> 00:56:01.128]  It's happening and it's a very short leap from international EU police to North American Union international police.
[00:56:01.208 --> 00:56:03.330]  It's just a matter of wearing a different badge.
[00:56:03.671 --> 00:56:10.177]  And they're in Serbia right now subduing Serbians who are angry about their sovereignty being taken.
[00:56:10.237 --> 00:56:14.462]  So, you know, that's what they're planning for America when they try to amalgamate
[00:56:14.963 --> 00:56:22.447]  The U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the agreements have already been signed whereby they can use troops in each other's countries.
[00:56:22.507 --> 00:56:28.070]  I mean... And make no mistake, the big foundations have been caught admitting they plan race war in the Southwest.
[00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:29.930]  They plan to get us all killing each other.
[00:56:30.331 --> 00:56:32.071]  We do not want that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:32.392 --> 00:56:34.413]  Paul Watson, unbelievable hour-long report.
[00:56:34.453 --> 00:56:36.033]  Thank you for spending time with us today.
[00:56:36.334 --> 00:56:41.376]  We'll keep watching PrisonPlanet.com for all the great work you and your brother, Steve Watson, are doing from the U.K.
[00:56:42.116 --> 00:56:42.897]  Okay, thanks, Alex.
[00:56:43.444 --> 00:56:43.845]  Thank you.
[00:56:43.925 --> 00:56:50.132]  From Airstrip One, there goes Paul Watson, where the secret police are on the streets and questioning him and his brother and others.
[00:56:50.813 --> 00:56:53.036]  I tell you, the time is very, very late.
[00:56:53.056 --> 00:56:56.420]  All right, your phone call is straight ahead and a ton of news, as I promised.
[00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:00.881]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[00:57:01.121 --> 00:57:05.443]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[00:57:05.643 --> 00:57:13.526]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:57:13.857 --> 00:57:16.678]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:57:16.959 --> 00:57:24.502]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:57:24.602 --> 00:57:30.185]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:57:30.425 --> 00:57:35.968]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:57:36.248 --> 00:57:39.490]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:43.154]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:57:43.394 --> 00:57:48.440]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Sheep superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:51.323]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:57:51.343 --> 00:57:51.624]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:57:51.664 --> 00:57:53.105]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:58:01.115 --> 00:58:03.237]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:03.737 --> 00:58:10.743]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:58:11.323 --> 00:58:17.468]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:17.908 --> 00:58:19.749]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:19.869 --> 00:58:22.311]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:22.371 --> 00:58:33.338]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:58:33.959 --> 00:58:35.239]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:36.981]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:58:37.501 --> 00:58:43.725]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:58:44.395 --> 00:58:52.144]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:52.665 --> 00:58:53.806]  The Obama Deception.
[00:58:54.246 --> 00:58:55.428]  The people strike back!
[00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:58.691]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:58:58.871 --> 00:59:00.332]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:59:00.612 --> 00:59:02.854]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:59:03.294 --> 00:59:08.037]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:59:08.438 --> 00:59:11.279]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:15.142]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[00:59:15.518 --> 00:59:27.531]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system, which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[00:59:28.071 --> 00:59:30.074]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[00:59:30.094 --> 00:59:31.395]  I use one every day.
[00:59:31.815 --> 00:59:34.178]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:59:34.258 --> 00:59:34.998]  I think so.
[00:59:57.361 --> 01:00:02.382]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:02.762 --> 01:00:05.103]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:19.367]  Coming up at the end of the hour, I'll spend about two or three minutes showing you some vacation photos.
[01:00:20.467 --> 01:00:27.394]  Last year, I tried to go down to where we go when I was a kid, to Bolivar, down by Galveston, and they searched us every time we took the ferry over.
[01:00:29.776 --> 01:00:38.025]  And, uh, this time I thought, well, I'll just go down to Port Aransas and then go over to the National Seashore and, uh, drive through there.
[01:00:38.105 --> 01:00:42.729]  And, I mean, literally, it was like Big Brother on steroids.
[01:00:42.749 --> 01:00:43.930]  We'll just wait till you see the photos.
[01:00:44.804 --> 01:00:48.006]  So that is coming up for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:00:48.406 --> 01:00:54.270]  We'll obviously be narrating and talking about and describing the photos for radio listeners out there.
[01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:58.853]  Speaking of PrisonPlanet.tv, we are being censored all over YouTube.
[01:00:59.973 --> 01:01:08.439]  David put up a little backup channel and they suspended that and shut that down and just said, no copyright infringement, you just can't have a site.
[01:01:09.951 --> 01:01:13.452]  So there's some other channels other people run and it looks like they're shutting those down.
[01:01:13.472 --> 01:01:16.313]  It looks like Alex Jones is not allowed on YouTube.
[01:01:17.193 --> 01:01:19.114]  So I banned here in the United States.
[01:01:19.154 --> 01:01:25.176]  The establishment's figured out that we're having a big effect on them and so now I'm taboo.
[01:01:25.436 --> 01:01:36.919]  I am the big nasty evil creature that people can't be allowed to hear because I'll actually read government documents about how you Genesis Nazis actually run the world government and they're poisoning you and your family.
[01:01:38.914 --> 01:01:40.575]  So, that is coming up.
[01:01:40.635 --> 01:01:43.616]  You know, I'm getting that weird cell phone interference.
[01:01:43.636 --> 01:01:45.537]  You know when you have a cell phone by electrical equipment?
[01:01:47.138 --> 01:01:52.660]  How it will... I see somebody's charging a cell phone on top of the board out there.
[01:01:52.701 --> 01:01:55.522]  Maybe that little devil is on doing that.
[01:01:55.902 --> 01:01:57.603]  You know, cell phones gotta be good for your brains.
[01:01:57.643 --> 01:02:00.704]  Forget all the thousands of studies admitting it's causing brain tumors.
[01:02:01.405 --> 01:02:02.545]  Little microwave units.
[01:02:03.265 --> 01:02:06.087]  It's gotta be good if you put it in electrical equipment and it messes it up.
[01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:07.710]  You know, come on.
[01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.530]  It's good for you.
[01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:10.872]  Okay, I said I'd take your phone calls 1-800-259-9231.
[01:02:10.932 --> 01:02:16.737]  I just want to encourage the listeners to get PrisonPlanet.tv memberships.
[01:02:17.378 --> 01:02:27.026]  I mean, you not only get all 20-plus of my films, and films like Jason Burnham's Fabled Enemies, you also get
[01:02:29.679 --> 01:02:43.886]  Live access to this show for at least two hours a day and then Jason Burma's 9 to midnight simulcast the radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv and we show video clips, documents, exclusive videos, you know, here you have my book, Paul Watson's book online, his e-books at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:02:44.246 --> 01:02:47.468]  Five plus years up and running and it just gets better and better.
[01:02:47.488 --> 01:02:49.048]  So PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:02:49.068 --> 01:02:52.430]  I want to thank all the members out there who've done that as well they make this show possible.
[01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:53.991]  Randy in Montana.
[01:02:54.031 --> 01:02:54.831]  Randy, you're on the air.
[01:02:54.851 --> 01:02:55.391]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:02:56.092 --> 01:02:56.312]  Yes.
[01:02:58.069 --> 01:03:10.691]  We don't get your show here until like four in the afternoon, so I may be way off topic here, but last night CBS News 60 Minutes ran what I consider to be the most blatant
[01:03:12.316 --> 01:03:21.338]  Psy-op that I've ever seen with UAVs and how they single out individual vehicles and individual pedestrians and just annihilate them.
[01:03:21.358 --> 01:03:23.159]  So they showed you the drones?
[01:03:23.179 --> 01:03:24.899]  You never hear them or see them?
[01:03:24.919 --> 01:03:29.000]  So they showed the drones that are face scanning us and tracking slaves?
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:30.460]  Yes they did.
[01:03:32.361 --> 01:03:41.203]  And a lot of people would look at this as just the superior western technology against the eastern barbarians that we may be fighting, but I took it as a direct
[01:03:41.764 --> 01:03:41.944]  That's
[01:03:58.286 --> 01:04:04.491]  Landscape around them erupts into like a small nuclear explosion or something.
[01:04:04.531 --> 01:04:06.653]  Well, there is no topic today.
[01:04:06.693 --> 01:04:09.235]  We're covering news, covering a host of issues.
[01:04:10.115 --> 01:04:13.017]  Tell us what station you listen to us on in Montana, Randy.
[01:04:14.278 --> 01:04:24.066]  Well, it comes on in two time zones here because we're so close to the border, but I get it on KPAX Channel 8 out of Missoula, Montana.
[01:04:24.904 --> 01:04:32.006]  And then again, you can watch it two hours later on KREM out of Spokane, Washington.
[01:04:33.247 --> 01:04:35.027]  You mean see it or listen to it?
[01:04:35.507 --> 01:04:36.328]  See it, see it.
[01:04:37.368 --> 01:04:38.708]  Those are television stations.
[01:04:39.009 --> 01:04:43.850]  Oh, the television stations are carrying the radio show or the feed?
[01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:46.311]  No, it's CBS 60 Minutes.
[01:04:47.391 --> 01:04:49.632]  No, no, I was asking how you're listening to the show, sir.
[01:04:50.183 --> 01:04:51.646]  Oh, I'm not right now.
[01:04:51.706 --> 01:04:55.973]  It comes to me by KGEZ, but it's not on until 4 p.m.
[01:04:57.697 --> 01:05:01.143]  Yeah, that's... What's the call number of that?
[01:05:01.163 --> 01:05:02.425]  What's the frequency number of KGEZ?
[01:05:04.253 --> 01:05:04.953]  At 600 AM.
[01:05:05.354 --> 01:05:08.657]  Yeah, don't they call it like Z600 or something?
[01:05:08.837 --> 01:05:09.658]  Z600, that's it.
[01:05:09.998 --> 01:05:15.903]  Yeah, I just wanted to plug that station because, and I appreciate your call sir, great points, I don't plug our affiliates enough.
[01:05:16.624 --> 01:05:21.328]  And there are so many great affiliates who I'm so thankful for, so I wanted to thank that station, 600.
[01:05:21.608 --> 01:05:24.771]  Yeah, not which one 60 Minutes is on.
[01:05:25.732 --> 01:05:28.993]  Yeah, what they do is they always introduce a weapon system that's being used on the foreigners.
[01:05:29.113 --> 01:05:35.075]  Oh, we tap Al Qaeda's phones, and then a year later, and we tap all of yours, too, so watch what you say, slave.
[01:05:35.835 --> 01:05:41.677]  Or they'll be, hey, you know, we have predator drones for foreigners, and now for you.
[01:05:42.077 --> 01:05:44.758]  Or we got surveillance blimps over Iraq, and now they're here.
[01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:52.461]  Or, yeah, we face scan and thumbprint all the slaves in Fallujah to track and trace who they are, and now we do it to you Americans.
[01:05:53.677 --> 01:05:54.517]  Because we're the globalists.
[01:05:54.557 --> 01:05:55.558]  We've conquered you, too.
[01:05:57.539 --> 01:06:01.520]  And it's the same story over and over and over and over again.
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:08.183]  You know, they claim they're doing it for people like, oh, we're using surveillance satellites for the Russians and the North Koreans.
[01:06:08.223 --> 01:06:15.246]  And now, oh, local police departments with Homeland Security grants, they dial into the live surveillance feeds of the NSA satellites.
[01:06:15.306 --> 01:06:21.048]  And NASA's launching more satellites than the NSA is to watch the American people.
[01:06:22.918 --> 01:06:25.859]  By the way, we're going to use those satellites to tax you by the mile.
[01:06:26.299 --> 01:06:27.060]  How does that sound?
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:28.500]  Let's go take another call here.
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:30.441]  Let's talk to Ryan in Mass.
[01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:31.521]  Ryan, you're on the air.
[01:06:33.502 --> 01:06:34.282]  Ryan just hung up.
[01:06:34.382 --> 01:06:35.403]  Robert in California.
[01:06:35.443 --> 01:06:35.823]  Go ahead.
[01:06:36.563 --> 01:06:37.564]  Good day here, Jones.
[01:06:37.604 --> 01:06:38.184]  How are you doing?
[01:06:38.744 --> 01:06:39.124]  Good, sir.
[01:06:39.964 --> 01:06:41.985]  Okay.
[01:06:42.185 --> 01:06:51.569]  I don't know about the lovers of death, but I do know in Isaiah 28, 15 to 17, it does talk about them making a covenant with death, and that hell, they were in agreement.
[01:06:53.244 --> 01:06:54.445]  Read the passage.
[01:06:55.325 --> 01:06:59.889]  Okay, it says, Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell we are in agreement.
[01:07:00.289 --> 01:07:08.635]  When the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us, for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehoods we have hid ourselves.
[01:07:08.736 --> 01:07:18.303]  And it says, Therefore say the Lord, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a stone, a trident, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation, that he that believeth shall not make case.
[01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:22.226]  Judgment will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plament, and hell
[01:07:22.953 --> 01:07:28.534]  All right, interesting.
[01:07:28.895 --> 01:07:40.357]  I'm trying to find the exact passage where it says that they were lovers of death.
[01:07:40.377 --> 01:07:41.898]  You know, they loved death.
[01:07:41.918 --> 01:07:44.558]  Well, I've been trying on my search engine.
[01:07:44.838 --> 01:07:46.459]  But I do have a question, though.
[01:07:46.519 --> 01:07:47.579]  I do have a question.
[01:07:48.459 --> 01:07:51.180]  What do you know about the Council of National Policy?
[01:07:53.211 --> 01:07:55.972]  We had, what's his name?
[01:07:56.012 --> 01:07:56.752]  What's that professor?
[01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:58.673]  I've had him on like 20 times over the years.
[01:07:58.793 --> 01:08:01.113]  But you bring it up and so I forget his name.
[01:08:02.094 --> 01:08:02.934]  What is his name?
[01:08:03.214 --> 01:08:05.234]  Oh man, he wrote The Politics of Heroin.
[01:08:06.515 --> 01:08:07.575]  It'll pop in my head in a second.
[01:08:07.995 --> 01:08:08.735]  We've covered it.
[01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:13.937]  It's like a neocon kind of thing to co-op the conservative movement set up by
[01:08:16.112 --> 01:08:20.778]  Set up by some of the folks, the Hunt Brothers.
[01:08:21.919 --> 01:08:25.324]  And, well you just talked to me, who?
[01:08:27.386 --> 01:08:32.212]  No, no, that's not, it's a professor I have on, and I'm having one of those moments where I can't remember names.
[01:08:33.686 --> 01:08:34.966]  And it happens to me sometimes.
[01:08:36.107 --> 01:08:37.627]  But I've gotten a lot of emails about that.
[01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:40.107]  So last time I had that professor on, I asked him about it.
[01:08:40.808 --> 01:08:43.028]  People said that he's saying it's the most powerful group.
[01:08:43.628 --> 01:08:49.149]  And a lot of people get obsessed with left-wing, right-wing, Catholic, Protestant, on and on and on.
[01:08:49.489 --> 01:08:52.670]  The globalists have tried to infiltrate and take over every major group.
[01:08:53.070 --> 01:08:57.911]  That's why you just have to move forward with liberty and freedom and a culture of liberty and freedom.
[01:08:58.811 --> 01:09:00.252]  But you can tell us about it.
[01:09:00.292 --> 01:09:00.992]  What do you know about it?
[01:09:02.126 --> 01:09:06.649]  Well I just know that it's another one of those roundtable groups I believe.
[01:09:07.709 --> 01:09:09.910]  Membership only by other members that bring you in.
[01:09:12.205 --> 01:09:15.027]  And they do have a lot of ties throughout the world.
[01:09:15.788 --> 01:09:33.580]  I've been doing a little bit, I've only been a little resource because I've been working on the book, Tragedy and Hope, and so all the things that you and Hara Watson were talking about, pretty much they wanted to do back then, except that they wanted Hitler not to go to war, they just wanted to do it by stealth and negotiation.
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:37.823]  Yeah, and so that's why they went ahead and took the Nazis in and put them into their stealth mode.
[01:09:38.243 --> 01:09:39.524]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:09:39.584 --> 01:09:40.484]  It is driving me
[01:09:41.425 --> 01:09:41.986]  Crazy.
[01:09:42.706 --> 01:09:43.667]  What is the name?
[01:09:43.727 --> 01:09:44.948]  He'd write Politics of Heroin.
[01:09:45.308 --> 01:09:46.229]  That's another author.
[01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:47.670]  What did he write?
[01:09:49.171 --> 01:09:50.532]  He's a 9-11 truther.
[01:09:51.633 --> 01:09:54.795]  Oh man, I can't stand it when I can't remember somebody's basic name.
[01:09:54.815 --> 01:09:57.057]  I feel like I couldn't remember Jim Mars' name.
[01:09:59.688 --> 01:10:00.448]  He's written about it.
[01:10:01.288 --> 01:10:02.828]  I don't know.
[01:10:03.308 --> 01:10:07.510]  Anyways, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:10.991]  Let's talk to Randy in PA.
[01:10:11.071 --> 01:10:11.851]  Randy, you're on the air.
[01:10:11.871 --> 01:10:12.251]  Go ahead.
[01:10:12.271 --> 01:10:13.691]  Hey, Alex.
[01:10:14.131 --> 01:10:14.532]  Hey, buddy.
[01:10:15.172 --> 01:10:17.412]  Hey, you're looking for Proverbs 8, verse 36.
[01:10:17.852 --> 01:10:18.653]  That's right.
[01:10:19.833 --> 01:10:21.133]  Those that hate me love death.
[01:10:22.514 --> 01:10:23.894]  Those that hate me love death.
[01:10:23.914 --> 01:10:24.974]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:10:26.135 --> 01:10:26.415]  Okay.
[01:10:27.651 --> 01:10:35.272]  Also, I want to bring to your attention, I got a strange late night, Sunday night phone call message from my daughter's high school.
[01:10:36.072 --> 01:10:41.313]  And of course, I'm here in the great old home of the Army War College.
[01:10:42.654 --> 01:10:52.655]  Now, there was a threat of violence to the school, so the school system, I guess, decided they'll leave every school student's parents a message.
[01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:55.976]  Yeah, what that is... Go ahead.
[01:10:56.376 --> 01:10:56.876]  No, go ahead.
[01:10:57.745 --> 01:11:09.107]  Well, just stating that there's this message that there's this violence, this threat of violence, and that they want to make us aware, and they're on top of it, and it's still okay to go to school.
[01:11:09.607 --> 01:11:14.528]  Now, that is a localized mind control system.
[01:11:14.688 --> 01:11:24.850]  I remember in 1989, the federal government proposed by law that all radios and TVs have an emergency transponder in them
[01:11:25.675 --> 01:11:34.554]  That would have an emergency shortwave channel FM and AM even on TVs where they would take over your radios and TVs and cable.
[01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:36.470]  We're good to go.
[01:11:58.746 --> 01:11:59.406]  We're good to go!
[01:12:24.531 --> 01:12:24.731]  I think so.
[01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:45.171]  For a short tell-all video, go to hazardrid.com.
[01:12:45.191 --> 01:12:46.151]  That's H-A-Z-A-R-I-D, hazardrid.com.
[01:12:46.171 --> 01:12:46.391]  Or call 800-675-0323.
[01:12:46.411 --> 01:12:46.891]  That's 800-675-0323.
[01:12:47.051 --> 01:12:48.712]  And order today!
[01:12:48.732 --> 01:12:51.513]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:13:04.242 --> 01:13:09.585]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:13:10.125 --> 01:13:16.308]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:13:16.648 --> 01:13:18.449]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:13:18.589 --> 01:13:20.970]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:13:21.051 --> 01:13:31.956]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:13:34.247 --> 01:13:35.488]  It's not about left or right.
[01:13:35.908 --> 01:13:37.289]  It's about a one world government.
[01:13:37.769 --> 01:13:44.113]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:13:44.674 --> 01:13:52.458]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:13:52.939 --> 01:13:54.099]  The Obama Deception.
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:55.780]  The people strike back.
[01:13:57.762 --> 01:14:01.384]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:07.234]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:14:07.694 --> 01:14:08.774]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:14:08.814 --> 01:14:12.875]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:14:13.515 --> 01:14:26.739]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:32.662]  For this reason Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:14:32.902 --> 01:14:38.863]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:14:39.564 --> 01:14:40.824]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:40.844 --> 01:14:42.184]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:14:42.204 --> 01:14:42.524]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:44.185]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:14:44.205 --> 01:14:44.265]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:57.282 --> 01:15:00.565]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:15:00.725 --> 01:15:04.808]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:15:04.988 --> 01:15:12.954]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[01:15:13.234 --> 01:15:13.654]  We're good to go!
[01:15:45.876 --> 01:15:48.018]  All right, Randy in Pennsylvania.
[01:16:14.318 --> 01:16:15.198]  It's all public.
[01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:16.659]  Most of it's not even classified.
[01:16:16.679 --> 01:16:20.840]  The Feds can take over every radio, TV station, you name it now.
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:28.602]  The technology czar, the internet czar, quit and said the NSA and Defense Department's taking over the entire web.
[01:16:29.062 --> 01:16:30.382]  They could have shut it down before.
[01:16:30.402 --> 01:16:36.484]  Now they're taking over the local hubs, admitting they're getting ready to end the web as we know it.
[01:16:38.485 --> 01:16:41.446]  And so, yes, the schools is all part of this heightened fear.
[01:16:41.486 --> 01:16:42.546]  Have shooting drills.
[01:16:43.703 --> 01:16:44.587]  Take over drills!
[01:16:45.712 --> 01:16:48.293]  The public schools are basically little mini-prison camps.
[01:16:48.993 --> 01:16:53.455]  If you study the Soviet re-education camp, they're more and more becoming very similar to those.
[01:16:53.515 --> 01:17:02.878]  Death education, zero tolerance, no dodgeball allowed, then no tag allowed, then no running allowed, then no shaking hands or high-fiving allowed.
[01:17:03.858 --> 01:17:04.818]  Literal prisons!
[01:17:05.459 --> 01:17:08.820]  More prisoner control than even a medium prison.
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:15.002]  They can shake hands or high-five or have contact in their one hour a day at a medium-grade prison.
[01:17:16.638 --> 01:17:26.325]  And so, if you're domesticating an animal, it's easier to get the puppy, or the colt, or the calf, or the piglet, and get it used to humans that way.
[01:17:26.365 --> 01:17:27.305]  That's the best way to do it.
[01:17:27.986 --> 01:17:29.787]  Not to have to break an already free person.
[01:17:30.367 --> 01:17:36.812]  I'll never forget Handgun Control Incorporated bragging in the Austin American-Statesman, an article I was in when I caught them engaging in some behavior.
[01:17:37.512 --> 01:17:39.013]  And they said, look, we've got your children.
[01:17:39.253 --> 01:17:40.233]  We're going to ban your guns.
[01:17:40.594 --> 01:17:41.434]  We've got the schools.
[01:17:41.694 --> 01:17:42.455]  And they laughed about it.
[01:17:42.915 --> 01:17:43.775]  See, they're going to wait.
[01:17:44.015 --> 01:17:44.416]  It's funny.
[01:17:44.756 --> 01:17:45.776]  We've given them our children.
[01:17:45.816 --> 01:17:46.697]  We've given them control.
[01:17:46.717 --> 01:17:48.318]  And they're just like, look, we're taking over.
[01:17:48.718 --> 01:17:50.999]  Time is on our side.
[01:17:51.039 --> 01:17:54.801]  It's like, time is on our side.
[01:17:55.481 --> 01:17:56.442]  Or is on my side.
[01:17:56.462 --> 01:17:57.763]  What's the Rolling Stones song?
[01:17:58.163 --> 01:17:59.584]  In fact, John, pull that up for folks.
[01:17:59.604 --> 01:18:02.785]  Maybe we'll pull it up on YouTube and come in with time is on our side.
[01:18:02.805 --> 01:18:05.407]  Well, if we start thinking that way, time is on our side.
[01:18:06.027 --> 01:18:09.651]  You see, and just get involved and realize we have power and can affect change.
[01:18:10.572 --> 01:18:17.459]  But yeah, they just do that to make any incident, you know, oh, we're here protecting, we're locking things down, to introduce the idea of mass shootings and violence.
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:23.405]  Oh, I mean, every couple weeks I see them arrest somebody for writing about violence in their English class.
[01:18:23.465 --> 01:18:26.588]  And it'll be, at first it was he wrote about the school and said,
[01:18:27.449 --> 01:18:33.110]  It was a story about hostage, you know, people taking over, you know, repeating some 24 episode.
[01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:39.652]  And then it was, he wrote a story, another one, about zombies at a fictitious school, but we're still arresting him, charging him as a terrorist.
[01:18:40.672 --> 01:18:43.493]  I mean, actually saying, it was fiction, but he's arrested!
[01:18:43.513 --> 01:18:46.454]  And we commend his grandparents for turning him in.
[01:18:49.173 --> 01:18:51.334]  And the seniors are like, God, I'm going to prison, huh?
[01:18:51.754 --> 01:18:55.915]  And the police are like, we don't care if it's, you know, a fiction story.
[01:18:55.935 --> 01:18:57.275]  You're going to prison, boy!
[01:18:57.916 --> 01:19:00.856]  So, I mean, there's no free speech for young people.
[01:19:00.876 --> 01:19:03.317]  It's just the tyranny is so intense.
[01:19:03.717 --> 01:19:05.357]  Anything else there, Randy?
[01:19:06.098 --> 01:19:13.380]  Well, I was talking to my children, told them this is just a test, and they're kind of preparing everyone.
[01:19:15.168 --> 01:19:15.668]  We're good to go.
[01:19:38.869 --> 01:19:47.693]  Uh, they're on, they agree, but then as soon as you start saying what it is that stinks, no, no, no, no, that's, I can't go there, I don't want to believe that.
[01:19:48.113 --> 01:19:49.214]  They become disconnected.
[01:19:49.314 --> 01:19:55.336]  Yeah, they think, they think they choose it like, oh, I don't want a blue ball hat, I want a red baseball cap.
[01:19:55.536 --> 01:19:56.697]  They think it's, I always hear that.
[01:19:57.037 --> 01:19:58.698]  I choose not to believe that.
[01:19:58.798 --> 01:20:01.099]  Oh, I choose not to believe that.
[01:20:01.539 --> 01:20:03.900]  I mean, what type of delusional fruit loop
[01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:09.941]  Just says, I choose, I choose not to believe I'm on a 50-story skyscraper.
[01:20:10.001 --> 01:20:10.681]  I'm going to jump off.
[01:20:10.942 --> 01:20:11.822]  Ahhhh!
[01:20:12.142 --> 01:20:13.222]  Oh, I choose!
[01:20:13.322 --> 01:20:14.022]  I'm choosing!
[01:20:15.283 --> 01:20:19.764]  You know, I mean, it's just, I mean, they're delusional idiots, man!
[01:20:19.804 --> 01:20:25.625]  There's a world government with eugenicists coming down on us, and I don't know what we're in there... Go ahead, sir.
[01:20:26.745 --> 01:20:33.987]  Well, I've passed out tons of your materials over the years and will continue to do so, and I see some light at the end of the tunnel, but we're still in the tunnel.
[01:20:34.597 --> 01:20:41.441]  And so, I wanted to make you aware of that, and also about the Proverbs, which is absolutely true.
[01:20:41.541 --> 01:20:46.664]  They hate Christ, or the Lord, and they love death.
[01:20:47.124 --> 01:20:47.485]  They do!
[01:20:47.525 --> 01:20:48.525]  They love death!
[01:20:48.865 --> 01:20:52.848]  I'm telling you, I haven't met a globalist who doesn't lick their lips and get excited about death.
[01:20:52.988 --> 01:20:56.670]  I mean, it's just so much fun to them.
[01:20:57.130 --> 01:21:00.152]  Folks, either you get sucked into goodness, or you get sucked into evil.
[01:21:02.131 --> 01:21:08.674]  And you're going to serve one of them and I mean, I don't, I just, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:21:10.509 --> 01:21:23.218]  Look, I know we got a lot of other callers from Randy in Texas, Cory in Denver, Mike in Wyoming, and then that's going to, I'm going to take those three calls, but I got to cover the news as promised first when we get back.
[01:21:23.658 --> 01:21:27.901]  And I will do that in great detail on the other side of this quick break.
[01:21:27.981 --> 01:21:28.581]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:21:28.621 --> 01:21:32.023]  Oh, and somebody called, yeah, it's Peter Dale Scott, the professor that's talked about
[01:21:33.104 --> 01:21:40.067]  How the establishment controlled the right-wing movement as well through the Hunt brothers and the Council on National Policy.
[01:21:40.467 --> 01:21:43.369]  Definitely New World Order all the way, absolutely.
[01:21:43.629 --> 01:21:46.330]  But there are some people that obsess and say, it's locato everything.
[01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:47.171]  It's minor.
[01:21:47.611 --> 01:21:48.511]  We're on the march.
[01:21:49.011 --> 01:21:50.612]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:51.533 --> 01:21:54.234]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:57.535 --> 01:22:04.520]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:09.043]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:22:09.303 --> 01:22:14.406]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[01:22:14.907 --> 01:22:22.011]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:22:22.452 --> 01:22:27.335]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[01:22:27.815 --> 01:22:33.276]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:22:33.656 --> 01:22:39.157]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[01:22:57.876 --> 01:23:03.182]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:23:03.702 --> 01:23:10.690]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:17.437]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:23:17.857 --> 01:23:19.698]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:23:19.838 --> 01:23:22.260]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:33.287]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:23:33.908 --> 01:23:35.188]  It's not about left or right.
[01:23:35.589 --> 01:23:36.970]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:23:37.450 --> 01:23:43.674]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:23:44.344 --> 01:23:52.111]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:52.611 --> 01:23:53.752]  The Obama Deception.
[01:23:54.173 --> 01:23:55.374]  The people strike back!
[01:23:57.535 --> 01:23:59.376]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:23:59.516 --> 01:24:04.698]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:24:04.878 --> 01:24:06.199]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:24:06.479 --> 01:24:14.663]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:20.665]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:24:20.785 --> 01:24:22.526]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:24:22.626 --> 01:24:24.727]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:24:24.907 --> 01:24:29.150]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:31.432]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:24:31.552 --> 01:24:39.378]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:24:40.879 --> 01:24:41.560]  We're good to go.
[01:25:14.168 --> 01:25:19.173]  Listen to that.
[01:25:19.413 --> 01:25:27.381]  You always say you want to be free.
[01:25:27.621 --> 01:25:33.226]  In fact, pull up the next one.
[01:25:33.286 --> 01:25:34.427]  Pull up Under My Thumb.
[01:25:34.467 --> 01:25:35.508]  Let's go over to that.
[01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:37.700]  That's how the New World Order sees us.
[01:25:38.841 --> 01:25:42.962]  And they have all these little tricks, left wing, right wing, this group, that group.
[01:25:44.562 --> 01:25:47.463]  They always want us fighting amongst groups, even in the Patriot movement.
[01:25:47.483 --> 01:25:48.444]  It's this group, it's that group.
[01:25:48.724 --> 01:25:49.884]  No, it's all the groups, folks.
[01:25:49.924 --> 01:25:51.925]  They control the big, dominant movements.
[01:25:54.485 --> 01:25:57.446]  What they hate is people that say, come together against the New World Order.
[01:25:58.186 --> 01:26:03.148]  Nationalism, decentralization, lower taxes, less globalism.
[01:26:04.463 --> 01:26:08.824]  Anybody that's trying to make it about left-wing or right-wing is trying to put you back in the paradigm.
[01:26:09.125 --> 01:26:12.246]  That's all the system ever does is try to get fights going on.
[01:26:12.866 --> 01:26:14.746]  I've got a couple video clips that are part of the news.
[01:26:14.786 --> 01:26:16.087]  I forgot to talk to you guys during the break.
[01:26:16.107 --> 01:26:18.588]  I was busy talking to Mike about some other issues.
[01:26:20.068 --> 01:26:21.429]  John sent you the clips I sent him.
[01:26:21.909 --> 01:26:24.930]  There's one where Bill Clinton, they're saying he's the Prince of Peace.
[01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:31.652]  Then there is another clip where, well,
[01:26:32.836 --> 01:26:35.118]  In my headphones, tell me what clips you got, because I've got to get to these now.
[01:26:36.459 --> 01:26:37.920]  Bill Clinton saying he's Jesus.
[01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:38.760]  What else you got?
[01:26:41.862 --> 01:26:43.484]  Oh yeah, Obama gets ahead of prompter.
[01:26:43.524 --> 01:26:45.145]  That was something I said a week ago and never got to.
[01:26:45.665 --> 01:26:47.767]  I mean, yeah, this guy can't even talk without a prompter.
[01:26:48.147 --> 01:26:50.789]  And then what's the other one, the other clip?
[01:26:53.530 --> 01:26:58.572]  Yeah, Osama's a CIA operator and being used to destabilize Pakistan, which is actually true.
[01:26:59.672 --> 01:27:03.633]  Here's the Pakistani president going, why are you saying I'm with the Muslim extremists?
[01:27:03.933 --> 01:27:05.354]  They work for you, pal!
[01:27:06.354 --> 01:27:07.634]  Which is on record, they do!
[01:27:07.654 --> 01:27:15.337]  I mean, let me tell you, the magic widget that fixes all the New World Order's problems, it's called Elka.
[01:27:16.889 --> 01:27:18.190]  You know, like those ads on TV.
[01:27:18.210 --> 01:27:20.191]  This new widget fixes, you know, fixes any lock.
[01:27:20.472 --> 01:27:21.392]  It fits any screw.
[01:27:21.432 --> 01:27:22.373]  It even saws.
[01:27:22.573 --> 01:27:24.775]  And for only $19.95 more, you get this one too!
[01:27:25.055 --> 01:27:25.796]  An incredible deal.
[01:27:25.856 --> 01:27:26.696]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:27:26.716 --> 01:27:27.697]  You gotta have it, folks.
[01:27:28.438 --> 01:27:30.539]  It's the new amazing Al-Qaeda Osama Bin Laden.
[01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:31.980]  It's got a big beard, a big turban.
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:34.342]  Guaranteed to scare your population into submission.
[01:27:34.522 --> 01:27:36.644]  And then meanwhile, you can use him to attack other countries.
[01:27:36.764 --> 01:27:39.426]  And when the country defends itself, you go in and attack them.
[01:27:39.926 --> 01:27:40.567]  How's that sound?
[01:27:40.587 --> 01:27:42.428]  The wonderful, magical... It works in Serbia.
[01:27:42.648 --> 01:27:42.969]  It works...
[01:27:43.962 --> 01:27:53.712]  In Iraq, it works in Iran, it works in Afghanistan, it works in Pakistan, it works in Africa, it works in the United States, it works in England, it takes the rights away of everybody in the world!
[01:27:53.892 --> 01:27:55.894]  The amazing Al-Qaeda tool!
[01:27:56.475 --> 01:28:02.761]  It looks simple, it looks like a normal Sharpie pen, but this super-duper absolutely amazing creature can do anything you want because it's theater!
[01:28:03.081 --> 01:28:05.664]  It can draw a big guy with a turban!
[01:28:06.084 --> 01:28:13.891]  and evil scary eyes with an AK-47 and it will scare everybody into submission.
[01:28:14.251 --> 01:28:17.153]  It's the new great Osama Bin Laden doll.
[01:28:17.373 --> 01:28:18.675]  There it is ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:19.155 --> 01:28:21.377]  That's not very good Osama Bin Laden.
[01:28:21.417 --> 01:28:22.097]  See the turban?
[01:28:22.378 --> 01:28:24.619]  See the eyes, the nose, the Kalashnikov?
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.322]  I did draw that in about three seconds so it's not that good.
[01:28:27.822 --> 01:28:28.423]  But it's real!
[01:28:29.403 --> 01:28:32.225]  Give up your rights or it'll get you!
[01:28:32.486 --> 01:28:35.328]  It's like attacking.
[01:28:35.348 --> 01:28:37.389]  You won't hand over your family property and your firearms!
[01:28:37.570 --> 01:28:38.210]  He'll get you!
[01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:39.351]  He'll get you!
[01:28:39.671 --> 01:28:40.232]  He's real!
[01:28:40.252 --> 01:28:41.172]  He's deadly!
[01:28:43.254 --> 01:28:45.095]  In fact, let's just go with a straight-up monster.
[01:28:45.356 --> 01:28:51.941]  If you don't take your vaccines, if you don't do that, then the flu bug will get you.
[01:28:51.961 --> 01:28:53.582]  Aaaaah!
[01:28:53.642 --> 01:28:54.603]  Flu bug!
[01:28:54.623 --> 01:28:57.885]  The flu bug will get you if you don't give up all of your rides.
[01:28:58.205 --> 01:28:59.166]  Do it right now.
[01:28:59.186 --> 01:29:02.789]  And then, of course, there's literally hundreds of new children's video games.
[01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:07.933]  Hundreds of new children's video games where there's the Carbon Blobs.
[01:29:08.553 --> 01:29:09.433]  And they look like this.
[01:29:09.493 --> 01:29:10.994]  In fact, Google Video Game Carbon Blob.
[01:29:11.014 --> 01:29:11.654]  I want to show folks.
[01:29:12.174 --> 01:29:13.435]  Oh, they're gonna kill you!
[01:29:13.855 --> 01:29:21.338]  You've got your little environmental... You've got your little environmental, uh, laser beam, and you go out and destroy the carbon blobs.
[01:29:21.638 --> 01:29:24.179]  And in the games, there's even parents that don't believe in it.
[01:29:24.539 --> 01:29:25.700]  They're a part of the enemy, too.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.681]  If you don't, if you don't give the bankers all your tax money, it'll get you!
[01:29:30.641 --> 01:29:32.182]  World government!
[01:29:32.562 --> 01:29:33.663]  Oh, the carbon blob!
[01:29:33.943 --> 01:29:34.983]  The carbon blob!
[01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:36.824]  You guys liking this, huh?
[01:29:38.885 --> 01:29:48.353]  Again, you have the bird flu blob, the swine flu blob, the carbon blob, and if that doesn't scare you, Al-Qaeda!
[01:29:48.373 --> 01:29:52.497]  Deadly!
[01:29:52.537 --> 01:29:55.159]  These originals will be on eBay later in the show today.
[01:29:55.859 --> 01:29:58.702]  I've got to have some fun here, ladies and gentlemen, because it's out of control.
[01:29:59.722 --> 01:30:02.405]  That is why we've got to be banned from YouTube, or being banned everywhere.
[01:30:02.425 --> 01:30:05.567]  I don't want to even make a big deal out of it this time, because it almost...
[01:30:06.775 --> 01:30:08.236]  Makes them, I think, hunt us down that much more.
[01:30:10.018 --> 01:30:11.439]  YouTube, I've got their email here.
[01:30:11.599 --> 01:30:13.921]  In fact, Aaron, bring that in.
[01:30:13.961 --> 01:30:18.024]  It's like, oh, we're just gonna start deleting the accounts that have Alex Jones on them, period.
[01:30:21.146 --> 01:30:25.149]  Let me get to this, since I'm screwing around right now, then I'll get into the attacks on free speech here in a moment.
[01:30:25.950 --> 01:30:27.111]  Let me get into this right now.
[01:30:34.096 --> 01:30:35.137]  Actually, click on Flickr.
[01:30:35.177 --> 01:30:36.278]  I look so stylish there.
[01:30:37.930 --> 01:30:41.351]  That's me doing an imitation of a minion of the New World Order.
[01:30:42.471 --> 01:30:45.272]  And very well done, if I don't say so myself.
[01:30:45.292 --> 01:30:46.732]  Look at that, guys.
[01:30:47.833 --> 01:30:49.373]  That is handsome.
[01:30:49.413 --> 01:30:50.734]  Just put it up on screen, please.
[01:30:54.535 --> 01:30:57.455]  That is a servant of the New World Order, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:58.256 --> 01:30:59.796]  That's me doing an imitation of him.
[01:31:02.537 --> 01:31:04.357]  Okay.
[01:31:04.777 --> 01:31:06.378]  I gotta have some fun with this, because
[01:31:08.046 --> 01:31:09.047]  What is it about this new camera setup?
[01:31:09.087 --> 01:31:10.607]  I can't ever seem to get in the middle of the shot.
[01:31:10.627 --> 01:31:11.848]  It's driving me crazy.
[01:31:13.329 --> 01:31:16.591]  House bill aims to strip right-wing extremists of the Second Amendment.
[01:31:16.611 --> 01:31:18.372]  I mean, this is even worse than everything else.
[01:31:18.952 --> 01:31:29.077]  Assault weapons ban, black powder ban, reloading ban, treaties and bills that if you criticize somebody and they say it hurts their feelings, federal felonies.
[01:31:29.137 --> 01:31:34.060]  I mean, this is just federal speech felonies now in America.
[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:35.661]  I mean, it's really happening.
[01:31:36.277 --> 01:31:38.418]  These people are really the criminals of the government.
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:42.221]  But, uh, did Aaron bring you in the photos from my trip?
[01:31:43.902 --> 01:31:45.924]  Okay, let's... So, imagine.
[01:31:46.484 --> 01:31:49.106]  I take off a few days to go camping, and then the last few days we go to the beach.
[01:31:49.146 --> 01:31:49.886]  So, we're on a road trip.
[01:31:51.227 --> 01:31:56.291]  And, uh, I'm driving to the National Seashore, down by Port Aransas, Texas.
[01:31:56.591 --> 01:31:58.272]  Uh, Corpus Christi are two of the nearest towns.
[01:31:59.893 --> 01:32:03.836]  And, uh, I go there... Saturday.
[01:32:05.598 --> 01:32:11.983]  And I'm pulling up, and I pull up and I notice there's a camera right in my face at the entrance to the seashore.
[01:32:14.526 --> 01:32:16.968]  Oh, I guess he put it on Flickr so they're little bitty cruddy photos.
[01:32:17.068 --> 01:32:17.628]  Oh, man.
[01:32:18.329 --> 01:32:23.293]  Can't we just upload them to, uh, just on our own server to a page so we have them big?
[01:32:24.594 --> 01:32:25.115]  Oh, whatever.
[01:32:25.135 --> 01:32:27.917]  Go ahead and put it up on screen, though.
[01:32:28.598 --> 01:32:33.602]  Now, this is only one nest of them, so you drive up to the National Seashore,
[01:32:35.336 --> 01:32:38.337]  Which is just a, you know, national park.
[01:32:38.997 --> 01:32:41.318]  And this is what happens after you leave the guard shack.
[01:32:41.338 --> 01:32:51.302]  They take your ten bucks per vehicle, to be there for the day, and you drive past them, and then right there, there are all these cameras to catch every conceivable license plate.
[01:32:51.402 --> 01:32:54.083]  That is license plate scanning software.
[01:32:55.296 --> 01:32:58.879]  All the big federal cameras, they admit, run through and run your license plate.
[01:32:58.899 --> 01:33:00.540]  So you're having your background check run.
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:04.242]  You can Google, uh, Florida town runs every plate that comes through it.
[01:33:04.823 --> 01:33:18.693]  That was, I've been talking about this for more than five, six, seven years, when it finally came out four or five years ago that Indiana and Texas and all these small towns, not just states, had federally paid for software where every car that drives through the town, the plates are run.
[01:33:19.053 --> 01:33:20.234]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[01:33:20.894 --> 01:33:23.895]  And now police cars have got it in Houston and Dallas and everywhere else.
[01:33:24.635 --> 01:33:25.415]  And that's what those are.
[01:33:25.435 --> 01:33:27.376]  So you're having your background run.
[01:33:27.416 --> 01:33:28.676]  They don't tell you this is being done.
[01:33:31.017 --> 01:33:32.517]  They're running to see if the car is stolen.
[01:33:32.537 --> 01:33:33.718]  That's how they introduce the slaves.
[01:33:34.458 --> 01:33:36.598]  And so this is driving up to it.
[01:33:38.179 --> 01:33:39.319]  This is driving up to it.
[01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:42.700]  Oh no, that's actually leaving.
[01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:45.661]  Because I didn't get photos at first when I drove through.
[01:33:46.161 --> 01:33:49.042]  But right when you're there, they're just in your face.
[01:33:50.151 --> 01:33:53.836]  You're paying, and there's a big camera right here, and it's got infrared in case it was nighttime.
[01:33:53.896 --> 01:33:57.922]  It wasn't, but it's got infrared arrays on it, and they're asking, hey, what are you here for?
[01:33:59.986 --> 01:34:02.868]  I'm going to ask you a few more questions, because everybody's a secret agent.
[01:34:03.048 --> 01:34:06.151]  They all watch Jack Bauer at night, and they're all fighting Al Qaeda together.
[01:34:06.491 --> 01:34:18.420]  And you can't go to Bolivar now, because literally there were Muslims with headdresses, and I'm not saying they're terrorists, the point is, they were all, must be a lot of Muslims that live in Galveston now, they were all going over to Bolivar.
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:28.348]  I'd go back across to Galveston to eat at night, had my children, they'd pull me over with my kids, tear the car apart, search everything, and I'd sit there and go, why does this happen every time I drive across?
[01:34:28.568 --> 01:34:29.309]  Every time!
[01:34:29.969 --> 01:34:30.969]  Happened like six times.
[01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:34.430]  And they would just say, well, we're not allowed to let you know the profiling.
[01:34:34.450 --> 01:34:35.990]  And I said, well, I see what the profiling is.
[01:34:36.491 --> 01:34:45.533]  You're searching black people and white people and anybody that looks like they're obviously from the United States, but I go, all these illegal aliens, why don't you search them?
[01:34:45.633 --> 01:34:49.334]  I mean, I'd point at obvious illegal aliens with cowboy hats and work boots on and workmen.
[01:34:49.754 --> 01:34:51.634]  You know, 99% chance they were illegal.
[01:34:52.374 --> 01:34:54.855]  And we don't, we're told what to search.
[01:34:55.735 --> 01:34:57.397]  And it's me, it's the milk cow.
[01:34:57.737 --> 01:35:04.644]  I'm seen as the big fat blubber whale to be sucked off of, the cowardly, stupid, dumb American.
[01:35:04.684 --> 01:35:06.005]  There's nothing I won't take.
[01:35:06.606 --> 01:35:15.094]  And the illegal aliens and the Arabs and everybody else, who even in their false paradigm, you know, of terrorists are under every rock, oh my God, there's probably one under my desk, there is one right there!
[01:35:15.114 --> 01:35:18.056]  You know, they have to be left alone.
[01:35:18.997 --> 01:35:20.339]  It's dumb milk cows.
[01:35:21.465 --> 01:35:24.547]  You're a Hispanic family driving a nice car, clearly American.
[01:35:24.647 --> 01:35:25.867]  You're out of the car, pulled out.
[01:35:25.907 --> 01:35:27.288]  I was searched six times.
[01:35:27.708 --> 01:35:29.349]  I'd sit there for 30 minutes while this went on.
[01:35:29.929 --> 01:35:30.690]  So I was watching it.
[01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:33.131]  Old couples on canes with RVs.
[01:35:34.311 --> 01:35:37.193]  And they... I even got some video of this, but we never aired it.
[01:35:37.333 --> 01:35:38.934]  No, we did air a few clips of it.
[01:35:39.674 --> 01:35:40.855]  I forgot about that on YouTube.
[01:35:40.875 --> 01:35:45.617]  In fact, YouTube Alex Jones, if they haven't erased it, probably have, because it's not my footage.
[01:35:45.657 --> 01:35:47.238]  I'm not allowed to shoot it myself and put it up.
[01:35:47.518 --> 01:35:48.579]  Anything I do is banned.
[01:35:49.199 --> 01:35:50.460]  You know, just me at the ferry.
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:51.380]  Actually, there is video of that.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:51.761]  I forgot.
[01:35:51.781 --> 01:35:53.942]  This is last year's family trip.
[01:35:54.542 --> 01:35:56.043]  And I can't get away from them.
[01:35:57.283 --> 01:36:03.847]  Everywhere I go, there's just feds and control freaks and the citizens are idiots and running around tattling, wanting to be slaves.
[01:36:07.699 --> 01:36:13.081]  And all the times I've been at the beach, my children were about 15 feet out, right where the first wave was coming in.
[01:36:13.101 --> 01:36:16.262]  You know, Texas Beach, you know, is shallow, going out 100 yards.
[01:36:16.582 --> 01:36:18.102]  They're like 15, 20 feet out.
[01:36:18.702 --> 01:36:22.323]  And old control freaks would come over and say, your kids shouldn't be swimming, there's a riptide.
[01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:23.464]  There was no riptide.
[01:36:24.184 --> 01:36:27.385]  You know, control freaks this, control freaks that.
[01:36:27.965 --> 01:36:32.266]  Just, just, because they all get henpecked all day and ask questions by government.
[01:36:32.607 --> 01:36:33.767]  So they're going to do it to you.
[01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:38.298]  Alex Jones Search.
[01:36:38.318 --> 01:36:38.598]  No, no.
[01:36:38.618 --> 01:36:40.280]  Try Alex Jones Ferry.
[01:36:41.261 --> 01:36:42.201]  Galveston Ferry.
[01:36:46.025 --> 01:36:46.665]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:36:47.146 --> 01:36:48.267]  Homeland Security.
[01:36:48.287 --> 01:36:48.667]  17,000 views.
[01:36:48.787 --> 01:36:54.572]  I'll probably ban it and say it's not my footage and we'll say it is our footage and YouTube will go, go to hell, it's not!
[01:36:54.832 --> 01:36:55.573]  You're banned!
[01:36:55.773 --> 01:36:56.673]  It's our country!
[01:36:56.874 --> 01:36:57.834]  We're taking your guns!
[01:36:58.655 --> 01:37:00.317]  And we're taking your free speech.
[01:37:01.477 --> 01:37:01.998]  There it is.
[01:37:02.719 --> 01:37:03.059]  Look at this.
[01:37:04.591 --> 01:37:12.353]  And, uh, every time I went over, and I literally, there's hardly anything since the hurricane had hit, on, on, on Bolivar to eat anymore.
[01:37:13.313 --> 01:37:14.973]  So my wife would want to go to Galveston to eat.
[01:37:14.993 --> 01:37:18.494]  And I said, look, after a couple days of this, I said, look, just go to the grocery store.
[01:37:19.054 --> 01:37:20.835]  We're not going back through that anymore.
[01:37:21.595 --> 01:37:22.335]  To go to the island.
[01:37:23.175 --> 01:37:25.936]  And to be searched, and searched, and searched, and searched.
[01:37:27.876 --> 01:37:30.657]  Yeah, just keep that rolling in the background while I talk and cover other news.
[01:37:31.357 --> 01:37:32.277]  I want folks to see this.
[01:37:34.155 --> 01:37:34.935]  Yeah, Galveston.
[01:37:35.196 --> 01:37:37.857]  And I won't be going back there, but I guess I can't go to the National Seashore.
[01:37:37.877 --> 01:37:40.539]  I mean, it's just parasites everywhere.
[01:37:41.099 --> 01:37:41.499]  Look at this.
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:42.960]  Searching the car.
[01:37:44.521 --> 01:37:45.342]  It's ridiculous.
[01:37:46.783 --> 01:37:47.823]  It's so ridiculous.
[01:37:47.843 --> 01:37:51.405]  Alright, like I said, put that up on big screen.
[01:37:53.627 --> 01:37:57.689]  This is all part of the atmosphere that there are terrorists everywhere and everything's dangerous.
[01:38:01.232 --> 01:38:07.615]  And, you know, calling the public schools that there may be a terror threat here at the school with 50 kids in it in the cornfields.
[01:38:07.635 --> 01:38:09.676]  Although, yeah, Al-Qaeda's everywhere.
[01:38:11.297 --> 01:38:12.657]  You guys can't punch that up full screen?
[01:38:13.978 --> 01:38:15.339]  Yeah, we'll let that roll in the background.
[01:38:15.779 --> 01:38:17.680]  Look at him searching the old man's RV.
[01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:20.981]  I need to go inside your RV, sir.
[01:38:21.622 --> 01:38:24.063]  Make sure there's no Al-Qaeda inside.
[01:38:24.103 --> 01:38:26.164]  Just training you to accept to be a slave.
[01:38:27.284 --> 01:38:29.645]  What this is, is a slave training center.
[01:38:30.205 --> 01:38:45.128]  We first started out at the airports, we're moving down to the ferries, all federal property, all state lands, and then regular highway checkpoints to be at hardened installations, whereas high school compulsory service people are going to search your vehicle.
[01:38:45.368 --> 01:38:46.449]  Literally, that's being announced.
[01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:51.430]  And imagine all the control freak Obamanoids running around
[01:38:52.210 --> 01:38:54.071]  You're just violating everyone.
[01:38:54.711 --> 01:38:57.132]  I need to search now the front of your vehicle.
[01:38:57.153 --> 01:38:59.294]  Look at this footage.
[01:38:59.354 --> 01:39:01.395]  Make sure you're not without a cut-up.
[01:39:01.415 --> 01:39:07.698]  Because you want to go across to your beach house or to a hotel and frolic around.
[01:39:07.718 --> 01:39:09.979]  Oh, you want to go on the Galveston Beach.
[01:39:10.199 --> 01:39:12.600]  We're going to have cops come up and ask you what you're doing.
[01:39:16.462 --> 01:39:19.304]  I just can't believe what bondage we're under.
[01:39:20.211 --> 01:39:21.675]  And it's getting worse and worse.
[01:39:21.695 --> 01:39:22.216]  In fact, here it is.
[01:39:22.577 --> 01:39:25.924]  House Bill aims to strip right-wing extremists of Second Amendment.
[01:39:25.964 --> 01:39:28.169]  Kurt Nemo, very important article.
[01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:41.955]  A sinister bill working its way to the House may eventually serve as a companion piece to a Department of Homeland Security right-wing extremist report that labels veterans and advocates of the Second Amendment as dangerous terrorists.
[01:39:42.115 --> 01:39:42.395]  H.R.
[01:39:42.415 --> 01:39:48.257]  2159, the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists, Act 2009.
[01:39:48.457 --> 01:39:50.358]  Remember what the Chief of Staff of the White House said?
[01:39:50.378 --> 01:39:54.980]  He said, if you are maybe a terrorist and on a watch list, you don't get your Second Amendment.
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:57.081]  One million, one hundred thousand people on it growing.
[01:39:57.967 --> 01:39:59.068]  We don't like you, see?
[01:39:59.508 --> 01:40:02.130]  You're not going to travel, you're not going to leave the country, you're not going to have a gun.
[01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:09.374]  The Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act, 2009, sponsored by Representative Peter King of New York.
[01:40:10.194 --> 01:40:15.798]  That other senator up there, that Republican who was supposedly so pro-gun, now is for total gun bans.
[01:40:16.198 --> 01:40:18.359]  She's going to reintroduce the assault guns ban next week, she said.
[01:40:18.379 --> 01:40:19.100]  That's an AP.
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:24.143]  On April 29th, with little fanfare or corporate media coverage, H.R.
[01:40:24.163 --> 01:40:27.425]  2159 was introduced and referred to the House Judiciary Committee
[01:40:29.039 --> 01:40:38.143]  The bill would increase public safety by permitting the Attorney General to deny the transfer of firearms or the issuance of firearms or explosives licenses to any known or suspected dangerous terrorist.
[01:40:38.603 --> 01:40:40.184]  That is the Rahm Emanuel thing.
[01:40:40.784 --> 01:40:42.745]  Oh, we say we think you might be.
[01:40:43.285 --> 01:40:44.445]  Sorry, can't hold a gun.
[01:40:44.706 --> 01:40:47.027]  By the way, I need to search your car and your RV.
[01:40:47.567 --> 01:40:48.947]  This is how we treat you.
[01:40:49.608 --> 01:40:55.750]  All them people with... Them people that don't speak English with Mexican plates, come on over!
[01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:57.211]  Hell, we're not gonna search you!
[01:40:59.966 --> 01:41:03.628]  Because you don't have schmuck written on you, like the American people do.
[01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:12.954]  Look, we've shown we like being raped by the government, folks, and they're more than willing to... Oh, got an old lady in a Lincoln Town car!
[01:41:12.994 --> 01:41:14.055]  Gonna have to search ya!
[01:41:14.275 --> 01:41:16.737]  See, these are just the lines where they divert you off to be searched.
[01:41:17.197 --> 01:41:17.818]  Every time.
[01:41:17.958 --> 01:41:18.718]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:41:19.118 --> 01:41:21.900]  The entire bill can be read on the GovTrack website.
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:25.923]  A similar bill was introduced in the Senate in 2007, but this one is racing through committee.
[01:41:27.907 --> 01:41:31.468]  As noted above, the DHS has compiled a long list of folks the government considers terrorists.
[01:41:32.048 --> 01:41:36.929]  The bill, if enacted, would allow the Attorney General a documented gun grabber to deny millions of Americans due process.
[01:41:38.850 --> 01:41:43.511]  And I would add to this that this is the first group they're going after.
[01:41:43.591 --> 01:41:45.251]  Most veterans I know don't have a criminal record.
[01:41:45.271 --> 01:41:46.532]  They're unable to buy firearms now.
[01:41:46.572 --> 01:41:47.732]  They're told, sorry, you're on the list.
[01:41:49.437 --> 01:41:49.977]  Now here it is.
[01:41:50.158 --> 01:41:51.819]  This is the Bloomington alternative.
[01:41:52.179 --> 01:41:54.901]  It says state criminalizes shouting about I-69.
[01:41:55.682 --> 01:42:00.586]  Standing on a table and shouting at public meetings is a felony in Indiana and amounts to racketeering.
[01:42:00.946 --> 01:42:03.047]  The offender is a member of the Organized Citizens Group.
[01:42:03.067 --> 01:42:08.412]  According to arrest warrants issued April 17th in Pike County for two anti-NAFTA highway protesters.
[01:42:08.432 --> 01:42:09.893]  They're being charged with felonies, folks.
[01:42:10.393 --> 01:42:12.314]  This is happening all over the U.S.
[01:42:12.594 --> 01:42:15.936]  They got a bill introduced where if you hurt somebody's feelings, felony federal charges.
[01:42:16.457 --> 01:42:17.357]  And they're not playing games.
[01:42:17.377 --> 01:42:21.519]  They're going to send people like this guy on screen out to do the arresting.
[01:42:21.539 --> 01:42:25.462]  And if you don't stand down and go to the prison, SWAT teams are coming, baby!
[01:42:25.902 --> 01:42:27.083]  And they've been to Fallujah.
[01:42:27.423 --> 01:42:29.384]  They know what they're doing and they love it.
[01:42:29.784 --> 01:42:31.665]  Oh God, it's good to crush America.
[01:42:32.045 --> 01:42:32.746]  They just love it.
[01:42:34.130 --> 01:42:46.980]  In the documents, Pike County Prosecutor Darren McDonald said a state police officer alleged that district direct actions by members of the roadblock Earth First Group between 2007 and 2008 are felonies under the Indiana Corrupt Business Influence Act.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.302]  So, charge them with racketeering!
[01:42:49.602 --> 01:42:50.282]  Now here's another one.
[01:42:50.342 --> 01:42:51.343]  Is your blog a weapon?
[01:42:51.363 --> 01:42:53.765]  House Bill says hurting people's feelings illegal.
[01:42:54.185 --> 01:42:55.446]  Felony charges.
[01:42:55.526 --> 01:42:56.907]  A lot more coming up.
[01:42:56.928 --> 01:42:57.388]  Stay with us.
[01:42:57.608 --> 01:43:00.989]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:43:01.129 --> 01:43:06.330]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:43:06.530 --> 01:43:11.291]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:43:11.491 --> 01:43:22.454]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:43:22.734 --> 01:43:28.298]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:43:28.498 --> 01:43:34.562]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:43:34.722 --> 01:43:35.362]  What about you?
[01:43:35.582 --> 01:43:37.483]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[01:43:37.503 --> 01:43:41.606]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[01:43:41.806 --> 01:43:44.048]  Call the Berkey guy and order now by calling 1-877-KDF.
[01:43:44.548 --> 01:43:48.070]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:43:48.090 --> 01:43:52.972]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:16.072]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:16.392 --> 01:44:18.213]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:18.353 --> 01:44:20.753]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:44:20.834 --> 01:44:31.717]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:44:34.002 --> 01:44:35.283]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:35.683 --> 01:44:37.064]  It's about a one world government.
[01:44:37.544 --> 01:44:43.887]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:44.448 --> 01:44:52.232]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:52.712 --> 01:44:53.853]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:54.273 --> 01:44:55.474]  The people strike back.
[01:44:57.361 --> 01:45:00.302]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:45:00.463 --> 01:45:05.725]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:45:05.985 --> 01:45:11.348]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:45:11.708 --> 01:45:12.828]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:22.073]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[01:45:22.193 --> 01:45:22.473]  Yes.
[01:45:22.493 --> 01:45:24.115]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:45:24.335 --> 01:45:28.500]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:33.185]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:45:33.566 --> 01:45:35.248]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[01:45:37.410 --> 01:45:38.150]  Keep it natural.
[01:45:38.491 --> 01:45:46.654]  Call Calbin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[01:45:46.874 --> 01:45:50.896]  Try Calbin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[01:45:50.916 --> 01:45:51.976]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:46:11.877 --> 01:46:15.378]  Homeland Security says everywhere you go in the United States, you're going to be searched and controlled.
[01:46:15.418 --> 01:46:16.198]  I'm going to jam in.
[01:46:16.218 --> 01:46:18.839]  Who are the last two callers in order?
[01:46:18.859 --> 01:46:20.019]  That's who I'll have time to get to.
[01:46:20.039 --> 01:46:24.540]  Alright, we'll go to Randy in Texas.
[01:46:25.961 --> 01:46:27.181]  And Mike in Wyoming.
[01:46:27.541 --> 01:46:32.022]  In just a moment, I want to tell you about two sponsors before we wrap up this transmission with a few final calls.
[01:46:32.362 --> 01:46:33.023]  Home Gain!
[01:46:33.043 --> 01:46:37.164]  You can check out Max the Little Orange Gorilla when you're on InfoWars.com.

[01:46:58.886 --> 01:46:59.846]  Just wonderful folks.

[01:47:10.113 --> 01:47:12.954]  I also want to tell you about MySolarBackup.com.
[01:47:12.974 --> 01:47:14.514]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[01:47:14.894 --> 01:47:21.036]  Hurricanes, snow, ice storms, global warming, gremlins can chew off your electrical wires.
[01:47:22.096 --> 01:47:23.196]  A lot of things can happen.
[01:47:23.916 --> 01:47:34.179]  And so instead of sending all your money to Al Gore and carbon taxes, I suggest you take your own power needs out of control of that control freak and go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:47:35.679 --> 01:47:43.282]  The degenerate control freak, blood-sucking parasites of government, the New World Order, don't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move now.

[01:47:55.827 --> 01:47:56.867]  Okay, let's go to
[01:48:04.994 --> 01:48:06.355]  You said Cory in Denver's first?
[01:48:07.876 --> 01:48:08.256]  Randy?
[01:48:08.517 --> 01:48:09.317]  I'm like, boo!
[01:48:09.798 --> 01:48:11.899]  Randy in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:14.881]  Hello Alex, I feel like I know you.
[01:48:15.022 --> 01:48:16.763]  I am a small-time preacher.
[01:48:16.823 --> 01:48:22.127]  I have cerebral palsy and I walk with two metal crutches and I say that not to whine, but
[01:48:22.526 --> 01:48:27.229]  You know, when God called me to preach, He told me to tell the truth, and I swore to do it.
[01:48:27.589 --> 01:48:35.855]  He showed me your video, Bohemian Grove, a little over two years ago, then began to inundate me with your material and say, you've got to speak.
[01:48:35.895 --> 01:48:43.400]  And I've been going into churches everywhere I could, and there's such pressure to only be positive, never say anything negative.
[01:48:44.210 --> 01:48:49.774]  I, you know, sometimes it just makes me sick because I believe in being good, I believe in being kind.
[01:48:49.814 --> 01:48:50.734]  Well, that's a cult!
[01:48:50.794 --> 01:48:57.258]  I mean, that's a cult cop-out when they say, don't talk about negative, only wear fancy suits and give me all the money.
[01:48:57.278 --> 01:49:02.742]  I mean, that is literally a cult when they're going, no, don't, don't worry about abortion.
[01:49:03.162 --> 01:49:07.185]  Listen, there's Cadillacs, big fancy business deals are being done at church.
[01:49:07.665 --> 01:49:10.327]  Government, we're getting government money at the church.
[01:49:10.667 --> 01:49:11.728]  It's of the Lord.
[01:49:12.068 --> 01:49:13.489]  You keep doing what you're doing, brother.
[01:49:14.389 --> 01:49:16.630]  I'll give you an acronym before I go, and I'll make it quick.
[01:49:16.931 --> 01:49:25.436]  But you know, Proverbs 24 11 says if you know of someone that's about to be drawn to death and you do nothing about it, God will judge you.
[01:49:25.496 --> 01:49:27.177]  God's judgment is coming on this nation.
[01:49:27.197 --> 01:49:27.677]  Now be positive!
[01:49:27.717 --> 01:49:29.298]  Don't read that Bible in church!
[01:49:29.358 --> 01:49:30.298]  That's negative!
[01:49:30.599 --> 01:49:32.420]  I love my Bible, but let me give you the acronym.
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:33.700]  Oh, that's satanic!
[01:49:33.821 --> 01:49:37.843]  Oh, you're supposed to read Anton LaVey's book, saying be positive and only have fun.
[01:49:38.623 --> 01:49:40.204]  Well, that's not the Bible I read.
[01:49:40.284 --> 01:49:41.785]  But that's what they teach in church!
[01:49:41.905 --> 01:49:42.226]  I mean...
[01:49:43.446 --> 01:49:43.846]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:43.966 --> 01:49:44.406]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:44.446 --> 01:49:45.767]  Far too often, that's true.
[01:49:46.207 --> 01:49:50.088]  And I've lost every friend just about I've had preaching this message, but I won't quit.
[01:49:50.388 --> 01:49:51.728]  But let me give you an acronym.
[01:49:51.748 --> 01:49:58.190]  The Lord dropped in my spirit the other day when Steve Quayle was on with you, or just before he came on.
[01:49:58.250 --> 01:49:59.391]  It's the word WARNING.
[01:49:59.411 --> 01:50:01.271]  I saw the word WARNING.
[01:50:01.491 --> 01:50:02.811]  W-A-R-N-I-N-G.
[01:50:03.412 --> 01:50:06.532]  Maybe you can make a t-shirt out of this or something if you wanted to.
[01:50:07.073 --> 01:50:11.774]  But it said, uh, WARNING stands for We are right now in Nazi Germany.
[01:50:12.652 --> 01:50:13.853]  W-A-R-N-I-N-G.
[01:50:13.913 --> 01:50:15.734]  We are right now in Nazi Germany.
[01:50:16.174 --> 01:50:17.075]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:50:17.515 --> 01:50:19.076]  Wow, that is powerful.
[01:50:19.136 --> 01:50:19.756]  God bless you.
[01:50:19.776 --> 01:50:20.117]  Warning.
[01:50:20.457 --> 01:50:22.898]  We are right now in Nazi Germany on steroids.
[01:50:23.298 --> 01:50:25.099]  Retransmission totally jam-packed.
[01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:28.101]  Begins right now on the streams at m4wars.com.
[01:50:28.321 --> 01:50:28.982]  Spread the word!
[01:50:29.062 --> 01:50:30.002]  God bless you all!
[01:50:30.022 --> 01:50:31.103]  See you back tomorrow live.
[01:50:31.343 --> 01:50:32.944]  Great job with the crew and everybody else!
[01:50:33.024 --> 01:50:33.585]  I love ya!
[01:50:33.605 --> 01:50:40.609]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:51:03.843 --> 01:51:04.063]  Of course!
[01:51:21.394 --> 01:51:21.814]  I don't know.
