[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.163]  We are back live.
[00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:21.928]  Gonna go right back to the pasture in one moment.
[00:00:29.742 --> 00:00:35.383]  The chains of prison moons are shattered by the sun.
[00:00:36.584 --> 00:00:42.945]  I walk a road, horizons change, the tournament's begun.
[00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:50.047]  The purple piper plays his tune, the choir softly sing.
[00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:57.009]  Three lullabies in an ancient tongue for the court of the crimson.
[00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:16.935]  This is the real world, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:22.020]  The private banking families that killed more than 200 million people last century.
[00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:32.818]  We are now under their control.
[00:01:33.698 --> 00:01:34.999]  Are we going to resist?
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.782]  Are we going to let them feed on us?
[00:01:38.842 --> 00:01:43.345]  Are we going to let them have a bloody harvest?
[00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:59.195]  Or will we stand up and defeat them?
[00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:02.978]  It is the light that they cannot stand.
[00:02:03.258 --> 00:02:08.201]  It is courage that defeats them.
[00:02:08.482 --> 00:02:12.284]  It is the spirit of courage.
[00:02:13.485 --> 00:02:15.226]  The spirit of goodness.
[00:02:15.286 --> 00:02:21.211]  For those of us that love innocence and beauty.
[00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:22.652]  And our willingness
[00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:27.955]  To stand up against the New World Order.
[00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:35.641]  Now, we just went live at PrisonPlanet.tv and Naomi Wolf has so many phone line problems, I just cancelled her again and we're done with her for now.
[00:02:39.332 --> 00:02:43.334]  Well, we just went live at PrisonPlanet.tv and we just had a caller earlier, but we had to go to break.
[00:02:43.814 --> 00:02:45.035]  He's a pastor in Ohio.
[00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:54.780]  He said, I just got a letter from the feds saying Romans 13, tell my home church of 50 people to go along basically with the things that are happening.
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.080]  Romans 13.
[00:02:56.738 --> 00:02:57.558]  And he's a new listener.
[00:02:57.598 --> 00:03:00.660]  He said he didn't know about the Clergy Response Teams.
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.062]  So, will you guys Google Clergy Response Teams on YouTube?
[00:03:04.402 --> 00:03:07.684]  I want to play this for the pastor, because he said he didn't know about it.
[00:03:08.484 --> 00:03:10.866]  In 2006, we got secret documents.
[00:03:11.206 --> 00:03:12.146]  Pastor Butch Paw did.
[00:03:12.186 --> 00:03:16.129]  I then talked to the two preachers, got the documents, published them at InfoWars.com.
[00:03:18.177 --> 00:03:24.601]  One of the pastors, they figured that he went to a local store, faxed the documents and said, should I erase these fax numbers?
[00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:27.523]  He said, oh no, it's just a store 20 miles from where I live.
[00:03:27.883 --> 00:03:29.004]  They'll never figure that out.
[00:03:29.284 --> 00:03:31.105]  And I said, okay, we won't take the fax number off.
[00:03:31.785 --> 00:03:45.934]  Within 24 hours of us posting it, FBI went in there with Homeland Security, federal marshals, threatened the place, looked at their surveillance cameras, looked at highway surveillance cameras, figured out who the pastor was, came to his office, we're waiting for him in his office,
[00:03:46.374 --> 00:03:47.775]  Threatening him when he got there.
[00:03:48.056 --> 00:03:51.779]  He also worked at the hospital as their chaplain, had his own office for free.
[00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.121]  They said, get out of here, you don't work here anymore.
[00:03:54.682 --> 00:03:56.263]  Now he had a pretty good sized church.
[00:03:58.545 --> 00:03:59.686]  People still didn't believe it.
[00:04:01.668 --> 00:04:02.929]  People still didn't believe it.
[00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.213]  Then it came out on mainstream news, they have doubled it to 26,000 pastors.
[00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:11.912]  They've built the FEMA camps.
[00:04:11.972 --> 00:04:14.314]  Notice the bill they introduced for FEMA camps, for the already built ones.
[00:04:14.635 --> 00:04:19.159]  Said, oh, we're going to pay to have medical centers and local pastors to help in the community.
[00:04:19.179 --> 00:04:21.901]  They're going to call them horrible work camps.
[00:04:21.942 --> 00:04:24.264]  It's, oh, it's a loving government camp.
[00:04:25.024 --> 00:04:25.965]  And how does it start?
[00:04:25.985 --> 00:04:26.266]  I don't know.
[00:04:26.286 --> 00:04:27.447]  I predict a year ago it would start.
[00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:37.856]  As people become homeless, they force you out of the tent cities, on national parks, state parks, and other places, into the facilities where you're prisoners, where you're frisked and controlled.
[00:04:38.516 --> 00:04:40.939]  That's now happening in California, Hawaii, and other areas.
[00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:44.503]  So, this is actually going on right now.
[00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:49.068]  I want folks to understand that.
[00:04:53.988 --> 00:04:55.309]  Let's go ahead and cut over here.
[00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.730]  Let's go ahead and go to that YouTube clip.
[00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:58.450]  Here it is.
[00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.592]  Will law ever become a reality in America?
[00:05:02.012 --> 00:05:06.334]  Some fear any nuclear, biological, or chemical attack on U.S.
[00:05:06.394 --> 00:05:08.455]  territory might trigger just that.
[00:05:08.915 --> 00:05:15.038]  And as KSLA News 12's Jeff Ferrell discovered, the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[00:05:15.798 --> 00:05:15.918]  Us.
[00:05:15.938 --> 00:05:19.202]  From my cold, dead hands!
[00:05:19.442 --> 00:05:23.627]  Charlton Heston's famous declaration captures a truly American value.
[00:05:24.067 --> 00:05:26.710]  The overarching desire to protect our freedoms.
[00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:33.597]  But gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
[00:05:34.298 --> 00:05:34.599]  U.S.
[00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:35.800]  troops also arrived.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.908]  Something far easier to do even now, thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act.
[00:05:43.388 --> 00:05:44.469]  That forbid U.S.
[00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.572]  troops from policing on American soil.
[00:05:48.797 --> 00:05:55.939]  If martial law were enacted here at home, like depicted in the movie The Siege, easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical.
[00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:01.561]  And that's exactly what the Clergy Response Team, as it's called, helped accomplish in New Orleans.
[00:06:02.081 --> 00:06:08.583]  Jeff, the primary thing that we say to anybody is let's cooperate and get this thing over with, and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[00:06:08.903 --> 00:06:14.805]  Such clergy response teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government versus the wishes of the public.
[00:06:15.285 --> 00:06:22.127]  In a lot of cases, these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they're helping to defuse that situation.
[00:06:22.427 --> 00:06:29.829]  For the clergy, one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public down or obey the law is the Bible itself.
[00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:31.690]  Specifically, Romans.
[00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.550]  Romans 13.
[00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.111]  Because the government's established on the Lord.
[00:06:35.891 --> 00:06:36.152]  You know?
[00:06:36.492 --> 00:06:38.155]  And that's what we believe in the Christian faith.
[00:06:38.175 --> 00:06:39.356]  That's what's stated in the scripture.
[00:06:39.977 --> 00:06:48.830]  Civil rights advocates believe the amount of public cooperation may depend largely on how long they expect the suspension of their rights might last.
[00:06:49.831 --> 00:06:51.473]  Jeff Ferrell, KSLA News 12 reporting.
[00:06:54.406 --> 00:06:56.087]  Oh, let's play that end part about martial law.
[00:06:56.107 --> 00:06:56.947]  I want to finish up.
[00:06:57.548 --> 00:06:59.249]  We cut the tape off about 10 seconds early.
[00:06:59.269 --> 00:07:00.229]  Go ahead and back it up.
[00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:07.793]  According to Tuberville, during Hurricane Katrina, the clergy response team provided 38 chaplains a day, around the clock, at eight different camps.
[00:07:08.893 --> 00:07:10.454]  Now, remember, oh, camps.
[00:07:10.734 --> 00:07:13.836]  This was secret until 2007.
[00:07:14.656 --> 00:07:17.038]  We told you a year and a half before, with the documents.
[00:07:17.498 --> 00:07:19.519]  It's like we broke the MIAC and everything else.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.301]  Because folks that are involved in all this know where to send their documents.
[00:07:24.534 --> 00:07:28.093]  Just send it to the address that's on NFLWars.com.
[00:07:29.704 --> 00:07:31.706]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is what's going on.
[00:07:31.766 --> 00:07:37.571]  So now, they've gotten even down and found out who the small churches are, and they're sending them letters.
[00:07:37.871 --> 00:07:39.772]  Pastor, I would like you to fax us.
[00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:42.675]  I know we just moved offices a few months ago, and I still forget our new fax number.
[00:07:43.015 --> 00:07:45.157]  Will you get the guys to give me the toll-free fax number?
[00:07:45.597 --> 00:07:52.083]  You can scrub your name out, any numbers on there, or put tape over them, or make a copy of the document and black that out.
[00:07:52.103 --> 00:07:53.304]  I don't want you to black out your original.
[00:07:53.704 --> 00:07:55.125]  I want you to fax that to me.
[00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:57.688]  I want other pastors to do this, because
[00:07:58.709 --> 00:08:04.132]  Again, secret police training pastors to tell their flocks to go to FEMA camps, take injections, turn their guns in.
[00:08:04.172 --> 00:08:07.414]  That's in the original FEMA documents we posted almost three years ago.
[00:08:09.175 --> 00:08:10.056]  This is very creepy.
[00:08:10.296 --> 00:08:12.677]  Then you know that Romans 13 didn't really say that.
[00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:14.419]  The whole chapter doesn't say that.
[00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:23.744]  I mean, if you are a Christian and follow that faith, almost all of the prophets of the Old and New Testament were killed or tortured or imprisoned.
[00:08:24.745 --> 00:08:26.326]  Christ wouldn't follow the government's orders.
[00:08:28.215 --> 00:08:30.136]  It's all taken out of context.
[00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:34.819]  But Pastor, for those that just tuned in, we're also live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.480]  Recap the letter you got.
[00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:37.741]  Go over it for folks.
[00:08:38.262 --> 00:08:38.562]  Okay.
[00:08:38.982 --> 00:08:40.083]  I've been looking for it.
[00:08:40.123 --> 00:08:45.786]  My wife and I, we've been tearing our files apart because I left it in the envelope.
[00:08:46.287 --> 00:08:51.330]  And when you send back your response, you are to put it in your church letterhead.
[00:08:52.344 --> 00:08:57.849]  What your response is to that, and you send it back, a copy of that letter with your response.
[00:08:57.869 --> 00:09:03.233]  I understand you called in, didn't think you'd get on air, but it's providence that you did, and it's somewhere in your stacks of stuff.
[00:09:03.253 --> 00:09:04.474]  Look, I've seen similar letters.
[00:09:04.774 --> 00:09:06.936]  We wrote the secret documents, so I believe you.
[00:09:07.337 --> 00:09:13.522]  Paraphrase them from memory what it says, and the point is, they're doing a survey, just like Obama, with millions door-to-door.
[00:09:13.562 --> 00:09:14.603]  Do you support him or not?
[00:09:16.123 --> 00:09:20.165]  Now they're even down to small churches, not just recruiting them, but doing a survey.
[00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:26.448]  If you respond back that you do believe in Romans 13, that we should do whatever the government says, they're now going to try to recruit you.
[00:09:26.468 --> 00:09:29.029]  That's why you hear CIA ads on radio and TV.
[00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.391]  They're tripling the size of HUMET domestically, literally taking over everything.
[00:09:33.612 --> 00:09:35.492]  But specifically tell folks what's happening.
[00:09:35.532 --> 00:09:35.833]  Go ahead.
[00:09:36.193 --> 00:09:36.493]  Okay.
[00:09:37.633 --> 00:09:42.296]  First of all, you are right, because I received two phone calls, and it was just like a survey.
[00:09:43.908 --> 00:09:49.954]  And it asked, as far as, do you support Obama and do you support his agenda?
[00:09:50.034 --> 00:09:51.816]  His and Congress' agenda.
[00:09:52.517 --> 00:09:56.020]  Well, I said no, because I didn't vote for him to begin with.
[00:09:56.521 --> 00:09:57.281]  And then I hung up.
[00:09:57.442 --> 00:09:59.944]  Well, it was like two weeks later, we got the same thing.
[00:10:00.705 --> 00:10:01.986]  And I just hung up.
[00:10:02.066 --> 00:10:04.248]  I didn't even answer anything.
[00:10:04.689 --> 00:10:07.812]  But then, I've gotten two letters now, so far,
[00:10:08.439 --> 00:10:25.753]  And one of the things that it points out, one of the first things that it points out is that if your church being 501c3, in other words, tax exempt, that it states that you're not allowed to, you know, make any political statements, things like that, from the pulpit and stuff like that.
[00:10:25.773 --> 00:10:33.759]  In other words, it tells you all the things that you cannot do, you know, it just kind of briefly touches over them, what you cannot do if you're a 501c3.
[00:10:34.159 --> 00:10:34.820]  Stop right there!
[00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:39.985]  Again, and I've seen those letters, they are intimidating people.
[00:10:41.386 --> 00:10:46.170]  Congress will make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.192]  Congress can't have 501c3s.
[00:10:48.592 --> 00:10:49.693]  It's not in their jurisdiction.
[00:10:49.933 --> 00:10:52.155]  But they issue them to charities.
[00:10:52.195 --> 00:10:57.180]  They trick churches to sign a contract, then waiving their rights, then they say,
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:03.490]  By the way, you're not allowed to be political during the crisis that's coming, but would you like to join us and be our political mouthpiece?
[00:11:03.811 --> 00:11:05.013]  Then you get to keep your 501c3.
[00:11:05.093 --> 00:11:06.856]  And then these lazy preachers...
[00:11:07.697 --> 00:11:12.359]  We've got mistresses, nice cars, they bash fish four or five days a week.
[00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:16.321]  I grew up around a bunch of them in Dallas, in the upper middle class neighborhood I grew up in.
[00:11:17.202 --> 00:11:18.442]  They're drunk constantly.
[00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:20.043]  To them it's a big business.
[00:11:20.303 --> 00:11:23.185]  Their kids are out partying every day.
[00:11:23.365 --> 00:11:24.505]  That's how I knew these preachers.
[00:11:24.785 --> 00:11:25.566]  A lot of famous ones.
[00:11:25.586 --> 00:11:27.387]  There was a bunch of them that lived in my neighborhood in Dallas.
[00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:30.268]  And then we go to other preachers, you know, houses that they knew.
[00:11:30.849 --> 00:11:32.690]  And so, that's why they're there.
[00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:37.973]  They're like, oh my God, my 501c3, my swimming pools, you know, the parsonage.
[00:11:38.353 --> 00:11:45.057]  They will sell their flock out, just like Red Dawn, you know, where the Soviets take over and they got the preacher and the mayor working for them.
[00:11:45.537 --> 00:11:46.418]  This is how they do it.
[00:11:46.438 --> 00:11:49.480]  And when I tell you that they have a red list and a blue list,
[00:11:50.575 --> 00:11:56.772]  Uh, just like our government funded Paul Pottenbrach's about it to kill three million people, they want to find out who they need to take out.
[00:11:57.153 --> 00:11:58.436]  Stay there, I'm gonna come right back to you.
[00:11:59.724 --> 00:12:02.745]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[00:12:03.125 --> 00:12:07.346]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[00:12:07.546 --> 00:12:09.726]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[00:12:10.066 --> 00:12:16.027]  According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[00:12:16.327 --> 00:12:22.669]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.

[00:13:00.237 --> 00:13:05.479]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:13:06.275 --> 00:13:11.618]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:13:12.138 --> 00:13:18.322]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:13:18.642 --> 00:13:20.463]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:13:20.603 --> 00:13:23.004]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:13:23.084 --> 00:13:33.970]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:13:36.261 --> 00:13:37.502]  It's not about left or right.
[00:13:37.922 --> 00:13:39.323]  It's about a one world government.
[00:13:39.784 --> 00:13:46.128]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:13:54.955 --> 00:13:56.116]  The Obama Deception.
[00:13:56.536 --> 00:13:57.717]  The people strike back.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:13:59.920]  Gold.
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.561]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:14:01.801 --> 00:14:07.904]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:14:08.084 --> 00:14:11.906]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:14:12.266 --> 00:14:14.147]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:16.488]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:14:16.628 --> 00:14:19.249]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold.
[00:14:19.309 --> 00:14:19.889]  We're good to go.
[00:14:40.575 --> 00:14:41.015]  I think so.
[00:14:59.548 --> 00:15:00.008]  We're good to go!

[00:16:00.388 --> 00:16:08.150]  Well... From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.770]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:16:15.151 --> 00:16:27.373]  Alright, to be specific, to have the government sneaking around recruiting 26,000 creatures, and I told you we haven't gotten numbers now in about a year, they said they wanted to double that again the next year.
[00:16:29.317 --> 00:16:30.959]  In 2008, we're down to 2009.
[00:16:31.179 --> 00:16:36.323]  I mean, that's classic tyranny, hardcore secret police, total violation of the First Amendment.
[00:16:36.343 --> 00:16:40.847]  The First Amendment just didn't free them in the press into a symbol and demonstrate and all that.
[00:16:40.967 --> 00:16:45.351]  It also says the federal government has no purview in religion.
[00:16:47.112 --> 00:16:49.134]  But yes, I remember Raymond Teague,
[00:16:50.458 --> 00:16:53.240]  The former NASA engineer who's been on air with us.
[00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:59.165]  I remember about three years ago he came in breathing heavy from a big Baptist church he goes to out in Dripping Springs.
[00:16:59.225 --> 00:17:00.926]  In fact, I've got a copy of that around here somewhere.
[00:17:02.768 --> 00:17:07.772]  And it was telling the church and the preacher, you do not talk about any politics, you do not discuss things.
[00:17:07.812 --> 00:17:13.196]  If you have a church dinner at a restaurant, church members aren't allowed to talk.
[00:17:13.276 --> 00:17:17.420]  See, and pretty soon it's, you go to a church, you can't talk about politics in your house.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.982]  It's already don't talk about it at a church dinner.
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.961]  And the pastors get up and admonish people.
[00:17:23.981 --> 00:17:24.901]  That's what Raymond was saying.
[00:17:25.181 --> 00:17:27.102]  You don't talk bad about the government.
[00:17:27.122 --> 00:17:28.562]  You don't talk about it in the pews.
[00:17:28.862 --> 00:17:30.523]  You don't talk about it in Sunday school.
[00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:32.423]  That's what America's about.
[00:17:34.764 --> 00:17:35.364]  Think about that.
[00:17:36.025 --> 00:17:37.105]  Think about how far we've come.
[00:17:37.125 --> 00:17:40.026]  Now they're going to set up checkpoints and take DNA from people.
[00:17:40.486 --> 00:17:40.886]  Blood.
[00:17:41.566 --> 00:17:42.667]  They're openly announcing it.
[00:17:42.987 --> 00:17:44.607]  Of people that are quote detained.
[00:17:47.948 --> 00:17:49.609]  Airport scanners of our naked bodies.
[00:17:51.035 --> 00:17:53.919]  Cameras in school bathrooms all over the nation hooked into the police departments?
[00:17:55.961 --> 00:18:04.572]  You fill out your income tax with what you buy, what you sell, what you do, what you own, everything about you and you waive your fourth and fifth amendment and turn it in, incriminating yourself?
[00:18:07.858 --> 00:18:14.040]  And then they lose your return, or do whatever they want, never get in trouble, and it comes out all these IRS employees don't even pay it, and it goes to offshore banks.
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.061]  This is what America's turned into.
[00:18:16.101 --> 00:18:17.781]  Going back to Pastor in Ohio.
[00:18:18.301 --> 00:18:19.462]  Pastor, let me give you the fax number.
[00:18:19.482 --> 00:18:20.862]  When you dig that out, send it to us.
[00:18:20.902 --> 00:18:22.403]  Everybody else should send these right now.
[00:18:22.903 --> 00:18:24.203]  Pastors, quit being cowards.
[00:18:24.843 --> 00:18:27.684]  You're allowed to shim the communiques of the government.
[00:18:28.084 --> 00:18:28.505]  Think about it.
[00:18:28.545 --> 00:18:30.385]  Now the government's bossing them, telling them what to do.
[00:18:30.405 --> 00:18:30.445]  866-894-1767. 866.
[00:18:36.067 --> 00:18:37.108]  8-9-4-17-67.
[00:18:37.468 --> 00:18:41.471]  That's 8-6-6-8-9-4-17-67.
[00:18:42.993 --> 00:18:47.156]  Don't procrastinate, because we need to do an article explaining how bad this is.
[00:18:47.216 --> 00:18:48.437]  I mean, you know how creepy it is?
[00:18:48.838 --> 00:18:55.363]  And a lot of listeners go to their pastors now, small churches, big churches, and say, yeah, are you part of a FEMA deal secretly?
[00:18:55.383 --> 00:18:57.205]  And they're like, get out of my office right now.
[00:18:58.052 --> 00:19:00.273]  What you're doing is questioning the Lord in Romans 13.
[00:19:01.054 --> 00:19:02.635]  Your soul is now in peril.
[00:19:03.135 --> 00:19:04.736]  You don't ask questions of your government.
[00:19:05.016 --> 00:19:06.257]  That's a terrorist action.
[00:19:06.537 --> 00:19:07.277]  I'm not joking.
[00:19:07.558 --> 00:19:09.299]  And they go, Oh God, yes Lord.
[00:19:09.319 --> 00:19:10.539]  That's it.
[00:19:10.679 --> 00:19:11.260]  I am the Lord.
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.100]  I am your preacher.
[00:19:12.781 --> 00:19:13.521]  I am the Lord.
[00:19:13.901 --> 00:19:14.242]  I am.
[00:19:14.482 --> 00:19:14.682]  I am.
[00:19:14.702 --> 00:19:16.143]  The government is our Lord.
[00:19:16.503 --> 00:19:17.463]  You do what they say.
[00:19:17.483 --> 00:19:19.224]  So we should have done what Hitler said.
[00:19:19.245 --> 00:19:20.425]  We should have done what the king said in 1776.
[00:19:21.926 --> 00:19:26.189]  Jesus should have done, you know, the three people in the lion's den, the fiery furnace.
[00:19:27.368 --> 00:19:29.549]  Moses should have done what Pharaoh said.
[00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:35.973]  Let's go back now to the pastor.
[00:19:36.514 --> 00:19:37.334]  Terry in Ohio.
[00:19:37.354 --> 00:19:43.758]  So they're sending you letters telling you what you can and can't do, but they're also reminding you in there to not be political and to follow Romans 13.
[00:19:43.858 --> 00:19:45.159]  Isn't that a free country?
[00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:49.802]  Government letters saying, here's the scripture for you, Hitler's favorite scripture.
[00:19:50.062 --> 00:19:52.764]  Pastor, what is it like to be getting this?
[00:19:53.404 --> 00:19:54.705]  Well, to be honest with you,
[00:19:55.450 --> 00:20:07.558]  It didn't bother me a bit because, first of all, as soon as I started the church, when we had the elders together and stuff like that, we started in a home and then we grew and we had a church.
[00:20:07.758 --> 00:20:17.384]  I told the people right then and there that, first of all, I wouldn't be taking a paycheck because according to what the Lord has shown me, that this is a calling and not an occupation.
[00:20:17.444 --> 00:20:19.786]  So I worked a 40 to 50 hour a week job.
[00:20:20.433 --> 00:20:26.397]  Had my own benefits and everything else, and I taught and preached on Wednesdays, Sunday morning, Sunday night.
[00:20:26.497 --> 00:20:28.798]  Well, by the way, Paul financed everything he did.
[00:20:29.319 --> 00:20:29.879]  Absolutely.
[00:20:30.379 --> 00:20:32.581]  He made tents and shared sheep.
[00:20:33.581 --> 00:20:46.870]  But one of the things that I wanted to point out to share with you and your listeners is, first of all, thank God for you, Alex, and Mr. Jones, and also for Mr. Quell, Steve Quell, you two people.
[00:20:47.574 --> 00:20:55.760]  Since I've been listening to you and been reading all your stuff online, I've watched your Obama deception, I've watched your endgame videos.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.563]  They are absolutely fantastic and they hit the nail right on the head.
[00:21:00.203 --> 00:21:09.630]  And I am a pastor that when I stand in the pulpit, I tell people what God says, not what my interpretation of what God says.
[00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.793]  Well, I understand that you don't care because you're not a coward.
[00:21:13.499 --> 00:21:14.719]  Can I share something with you?
[00:21:14.739 --> 00:21:16.740]  Well sure, I'm going to hold you over and we're going to get more calls.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:24.002]  But the issue is, you've got to warn other people because, I mean, this is over-the-top creepy tyranny.
[00:21:24.022 --> 00:21:26.103]  The Army is going to be out this weekend running checkpoints.
[00:21:26.343 --> 00:21:28.884]  By the way, pastors, don't criticize the government.
[00:21:28.924 --> 00:21:29.844]  We're watching you.
[00:21:30.124 --> 00:21:31.025]  We're America!
[00:21:31.365 --> 00:21:34.266]  And you're free to sit down and shut up and have your guns in.
[00:21:34.846 --> 00:21:36.406]  By the way, the bankers love you.
[00:21:36.426 --> 00:21:41.368]  And they send federal reserve representatives to all the public schools, literally all of them, that I've seen.
[00:21:42.088 --> 00:21:42.348]  Keep going.
[00:21:42.388 --> 00:21:44.790]  The Federal Reserve is run by the government and is good.
[00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:46.251]  They care about you.
[00:21:46.591 --> 00:21:47.291]  Stay there, Pastor.
[00:21:47.311 --> 00:21:47.972]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:49.773 --> 00:21:50.674]  We're on the march.
[00:21:51.174 --> 00:21:52.775]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:53.716 --> 00:21:56.397]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:00.046 --> 00:22:06.570]  Did you know that the new energy czar wants to control how much power your electrical company allows you to have?
[00:22:06.891 --> 00:22:07.511]  It's true.
[00:22:07.831 --> 00:22:13.035]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:14.796]  Not if, but when.
[00:22:17.293 --> 00:22:17.653]  Let's do it!
[00:22:32.762 --> 00:22:40.044]  This generator is solar powered, complete with battery backup, has no moving parts to wear out or break, and requires no gas.
[00:22:40.204 --> 00:22:43.925]  Don't wait for the Energy Czar to cut your power or raise your rates.
[00:22:44.186 --> 00:22:46.406]  Produce your own electricity for free.
[00:22:46.646 --> 00:22:48.687]  Go to MySolarBackup.com.
[00:22:48.907 --> 00:22:51.228]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:22:51.468 --> 00:22:51.948]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:22:51.968 --> 00:22:52.008]  877-327-0365.
[00:23:00.225 --> 00:23:05.527]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:06.028 --> 00:23:13.031]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:23:13.611 --> 00:23:19.774]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:23:20.214 --> 00:23:22.035]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:23:22.176 --> 00:23:24.597]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:23:24.677 --> 00:23:35.625]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:23:36.245 --> 00:23:37.546]  It's not about left or right.
[00:23:37.926 --> 00:23:39.287]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:23:39.788 --> 00:23:46.012]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:23:46.678 --> 00:23:50.900]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:56.663]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free and can greatly benefit the health of the human body.
[00:24:11.636 --> 00:24:19.998]  By calling 908-691-2608 or visiting hempusa.org, you can benefit from this wonderful natural food source.
[00:24:20.659 --> 00:24:28.081]  Our customers are also purchasing this natural food for long-term storage, camping, survival and emergency food rations.
[00:24:28.581 --> 00:24:34.142]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org today.
[00:24:34.803 --> 00:24:39.564]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future
[00:24:39.966 --> 00:24:40.386]  I don't know.
[00:25:10.376 --> 00:25:11.037]  We're good to go.
[00:25:26.351 --> 00:25:28.773]  Yeah, well I'm sick of it going that way!
[00:25:28.813 --> 00:25:29.833]  And I want you to get fired!
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:26:08.002]  You know, I'm kind of flipping out and getting upset on air because you're supposed to break the spell and realize, you know, when I get up here and I tell you they've created a red and blue list of who to arrest and who to kill on the spot,
[00:26:09.369 --> 00:26:10.530]  They admit all this.
[00:26:11.351 --> 00:26:18.016]  This has come out in government documents we've covered here, and if you watch what happened in Iraq, in places like Fallujah, they admitted they had a red and blue list.
[00:26:18.437 --> 00:26:24.282]  That goes back to Vietnam, with the Phoenix teams and the rest of it.
[00:26:24.922 --> 00:26:33.810]  And folks, they admit publicly, I mean, I've got Army documents where I am called a terrorist for going out and protesting the private Federal Reserve.
[00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:37.152]  It says, military, don't let him know, they'll kill you.
[00:26:38.038 --> 00:26:39.600]  Watch out, they'll try to kill you!
[00:26:40.301 --> 00:26:42.463]  And we're out there, you know, Ron Paul's being spied on.
[00:26:42.663 --> 00:26:44.586]  Watch out, this group will try to kill you!
[00:26:47.409 --> 00:26:52.535]  They're saying we're the enemy because we're the real Americans that don't want to be taken over by offshore banks!
[00:26:53.817 --> 00:26:56.440]  And we don't want the pension funds to all be stolen and everything else.
[00:26:57.671 --> 00:26:58.912]  All right, I said I'd get to other callers.
[00:26:58.932 --> 00:27:00.413]  I want the pastor to be able to finish up.
[00:27:01.254 --> 00:27:10.102]  Pastor, Romans 13, the way the government sends you letters saying, worship the government, do what they say, then we should have followed Hitler because all governments are of God, as that pastor said on the news earlier.
[00:27:10.642 --> 00:27:12.744]  The founding fathers shouldn't have fought King George.
[00:27:13.604 --> 00:27:15.866]  Why was John the Baptist's head cut off?
[00:27:16.647 --> 00:27:17.728]  Why was Paul killed?
[00:27:18.128 --> 00:27:19.509]  Why were people crucified?
[00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.031]  Why were they boiled in oil?
[00:27:21.331 --> 00:27:22.512]  Why were they in prison?
[00:27:23.393 --> 00:27:25.034]  Why didn't Moses follow the orders?
[00:27:25.194 --> 00:27:25.394]  I mean,
[00:27:26.575 --> 00:27:32.759]  The whole Bible is about fighting evil, standing up to tyranny, you know, who will protect the innocent from the wicked ones.
[00:27:32.779 --> 00:27:33.840]  There's all those verses.
[00:27:34.861 --> 00:27:41.505]  When the evil comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it.
[00:27:41.985 --> 00:27:48.309]  I mean, if that evil government that's coming against you is a government, how could you stand up against it because it's of the Lord?
[00:27:49.109 --> 00:27:53.672]  I mean, this is kind of an Eastern mysticism view, really, of you make what you believe.
[00:27:53.912 --> 00:27:54.433]  Look at India.
[00:27:55.498 --> 00:28:05.426]  Intelligent, smart people, but they believe in this magical, the secret thinking, and so everybody's literally living in feces on the side of the street, and people are starving to death everywhere.
[00:28:05.446 --> 00:28:15.715]  You know, it's this magical thinking of... I saw all these comments on The Preacher with hundreds of thousands of views, he's on the show tomorrow, who got beat up at the checkpoint, you know, 75 miles over the border.
[00:28:17.176 --> 00:28:19.218]  He's a carpenter in his spare time, he had his tools.
[00:28:19.978 --> 00:28:22.681]  You always notice the real preachers actually have a day job.
[00:28:26.231 --> 00:28:29.933]  They beat him up, savaged him, split his head open for saying, you can't search my car without a warrant.
[00:28:31.034 --> 00:28:34.235]  This is becoming a big issue, because the Constitution free zone is 100 miles into the border.
[00:28:35.556 --> 00:28:39.778]  And they were under there going, Romans 13, you got what you deserve pastor, you should have done what they said.
[00:28:40.159 --> 00:28:48.183]  I mean, if he said throw your child into a meat grinder, have the Lord, you know, like, false of doom, come to me my child, come to me, and they just jump off the balcony.
[00:28:48.523 --> 00:28:52.405]  Because, you know, the preachers of the Lord, the governments of the Lord.
[00:28:52.425 --> 00:28:54.106]  Go ahead and make your point.
[00:28:55.225 --> 00:29:02.546]  The reason I want to do this is because I want people on your show, that listen to your show, to understand what the Bible really says in Romans 13.
[00:29:03.026 --> 00:29:04.087]  Because this is the truth.
[00:29:04.567 --> 00:29:05.867]  And I already put this together.
[00:29:05.887 --> 00:29:11.888]  It was, if you are blinded by spiritual truth, you will be blinded by natural truth.
[00:29:12.268 --> 00:29:22.030]  In other words, if you are lied to, as far as what you're being told the Bible says, then the people in the world, the natural world, they can tell you whatever they want to tell you, because you're already blinded.
[00:29:22.594 --> 00:29:29.499]  But listen to what Romans 13, chapter 13, verses 1 through 7, listen to what it says.
[00:29:29.579 --> 00:29:36.103]  It says, The governments are ordained of God and are to be obeyed.
[00:29:36.123 --> 00:29:45.850]  They are to bear the sword and execute vengeance on evildoers, and they are entitled to gather taxes from the citizens, the rights of the government,
[00:29:49.096 --> 00:29:51.578]  ...are derived from the governed.
[00:29:51.878 --> 00:29:52.438]  That's us!
[00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:58.682]  A citizen should neither cringe before government nor be subvervant to it.
[00:29:59.162 --> 00:30:02.004]  He is a patriot who should love his country.
[00:30:02.024 --> 00:30:04.165]  He is not a slave to it.
[00:30:04.866 --> 00:30:16.413]  Only as long as God... as God-given rights of religious and political liberty exist, is he compelled to render government its taxes, import duties, and the like.
[00:30:17.026 --> 00:30:26.095]  It's just like when Caesar's laws required the Christians to break God's law, he must resist Caesar and obey God, period.
[00:30:26.115 --> 00:30:27.316]  And you know what?
[00:30:27.777 --> 00:30:29.218]  I'm already on the red list.
[00:30:29.659 --> 00:30:34.924]  I'm a non-denominational pastor, I'm a Vietnam vet, and I have a license to carry.
[00:30:35.825 --> 00:30:36.666]  So, you know what?
[00:30:37.202 --> 00:30:39.983]  They can't touch me unless God says it's my time.
[00:30:40.363 --> 00:30:42.084]  And even then, I still win.
[00:30:42.504 --> 00:30:43.064]  Exactly.
[00:30:43.104 --> 00:30:46.145]  And that's why when you get past the fear, isn't that a liberating feeling?
[00:30:46.165 --> 00:30:49.546]  You really start living when you just say, I don't care what you do to me.
[00:30:49.846 --> 00:30:51.027]  I'm standing up to you.
[00:30:52.067 --> 00:30:53.888]  It's liberating.
[00:30:54.508 --> 00:31:00.510]  I've seen how the government truly was when I was overseas during Vietnam.
[00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:03.711]  Because every time we'd go out, they always told us, if you get caught,
[00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:05.489]  You weren't supposed to be there.
[00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:07.310]  But they were the ones that sent us.
[00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:09.650]  Absolutely.
[00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:10.451]  Well, God bless you.
[00:31:10.491 --> 00:31:11.871]  Listen, everybody faxes those.
[00:31:11.891 --> 00:31:12.831]  We'll do an article on it.
[00:31:13.151 --> 00:31:14.832]  Be sure and black out anything you don't want seen.
[00:31:14.852 --> 00:31:14.892]  866-894-1767.
[00:31:14.912 --> 00:31:15.252]  866-894-1767.
[00:31:15.312 --> 00:31:15.672]  Oh, boy.
[00:31:15.712 --> 00:31:15.992]  Okay.
[00:31:16.012 --> 00:31:17.092]  I said I'd take a lot of calls.
[00:31:17.112 --> 00:31:18.453]  We got that caller.
[00:31:18.493 --> 00:31:19.133]  I had him on for...
[00:31:29.083 --> 00:31:39.666]  How you doing Alex?
[00:31:40.866 --> 00:31:46.808]  First I'd like to say thank you for leading up the charge and opening people's eyes and standing up to the New World Order.
[00:31:48.308 --> 00:31:51.729]  It's something I want to bring to light that's kind of got pushed under the rug lately.
[00:31:52.729 --> 00:31:55.171]  Is Fiat getting forced by the government?
[00:31:55.211 --> 00:31:59.014]  Well, Dodge getting forced by the government to sell to Fiat.
[00:31:59.815 --> 00:32:00.135]  I know.
[00:32:00.575 --> 00:32:10.162]  Listen, they come in with our tax money, give them, you know, $20 billion a piece, and then order it handed over to Globalist when the head of Fiat is that Bilderberg Group member.
[00:32:10.603 --> 00:32:11.163]  That's right.
[00:32:11.984 --> 00:32:15.547]  Agnelli was, he was founder of the Trilateral Commission.
[00:32:16.227 --> 00:32:18.629]  So, not only are they going after Chrysler,
[00:32:19.113 --> 00:32:22.476]  They said let's just go after the biggest automaker in the world.
[00:32:23.977 --> 00:32:30.543]  Now the government took our money and is going to privatize the stock, the government money into stock and just give it to themselves.
[00:32:30.583 --> 00:32:31.964]  I mean, it's just...
[00:32:34.326 --> 00:32:35.707]  Sir, I keep going back to this.
[00:32:35.727 --> 00:32:42.911]  Do you realize how creepy and evil and confirmed bad it is when they are telling preachers you can't preach and criticize government?
[00:32:43.191 --> 00:32:44.672]  And by the way, do you want to work for us?
[00:32:44.692 --> 00:32:50.375]  I mean, do you want to know how secret police that is when they're recruiting the executives and the preachers and the community leaders?
[00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.573]  And running CIA ads on radio and TV everywhere.
[00:32:54.593 --> 00:32:58.596]  And admittedly got CIA operating in every town and city.
[00:32:59.017 --> 00:33:04.181]  And they're bringing the drugs in and then they put our kids in jail if they're dumb enough to get caught using them.
[00:33:04.522 --> 00:33:06.483]  Young people, everybody, get off drugs!
[00:33:06.544 --> 00:33:07.464]  Don't ever use them!
[00:33:07.825 --> 00:33:11.888]  Not because you're not old enough or it's too cool for you or you're getting away with something.
[00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:16.573]  Hollywood makes it sexy so you'll use their product and end up in their prisons.
[00:33:17.133 --> 00:33:22.595]  That's why they've been in Afghanistan for eight years, and that opium's up by eight-fold what it was before the globalists went in.
[00:33:23.055 --> 00:33:24.596]  Don't use drugs!
[00:33:24.696 --> 00:33:25.576]  Beat the man!
[00:33:26.577 --> 00:33:27.877]  Don't use any of their crap.
[00:33:27.897 --> 00:33:32.879]  In fact, don't smoke cigarettes, don't drink, don't smoke any, don't use any of their drugs.
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.720]  Don't use any of it!
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:36.081]  Let's beat them!
[00:33:36.941 --> 00:33:38.502]  Scumbag, filth government.
[00:33:38.542 --> 00:33:39.002]  Go ahead.
[00:33:39.962 --> 00:33:46.585]  Another thing that I was wanting to hit on is, I was on the internet, I don't remember exactly where I was, and
[00:33:47.421 --> 00:33:55.087]  They were talking about getting information about them trying to bankrupt Iran and all the oil-producing countries instead of fighting them.
[00:33:55.127 --> 00:33:56.888]  I mean, that's a sure enough way to beat them.
[00:33:57.268 --> 00:34:04.693]  So, I mean, that just solidifies with the Obama deception that there is a secret society that's running everything.
[00:34:05.154 --> 00:34:09.397]  And I just want to say with you and the rest of America that I'm tired of it.
[00:34:09.437 --> 00:34:13.620]  I'm going to stand up against tyranny, and I'm mad as hell, and I ain't going to take this shit no more.
[00:34:13.931 --> 00:34:15.732]  Alright, I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:34:15.832 --> 00:34:16.433]  Take care.
[00:34:17.133 --> 00:34:19.555]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[00:34:19.655 --> 00:34:23.338]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ken in Texas.
[00:34:23.418 --> 00:34:24.198]  Ken, you're on the air.
[00:34:24.558 --> 00:34:24.919]  Hello, Alex.
[00:34:24.959 --> 00:34:28.061]  I have an important question and a quick statement afterwards.
[00:34:28.441 --> 00:34:29.442]  I'm really concerned...
[00:34:30.526 --> 00:34:40.776]  People that were camped out out there that y'all filmed out in California, I understand that they're all gone now and I'm thinking, oh wow, they ship them on top of that mountain in Idaho.
[00:34:41.256 --> 00:34:42.417]  Do you have any idea?
[00:34:42.477 --> 00:34:43.638]  I'm concerned about them.
[00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:48.483]  Yeah, there was only 150 beds in the sports stadium.
[00:34:50.234 --> 00:35:16.267]  uh... where they frisked him and they're basically prisoners and so they just kicked him off and then harass him and arrest him if they're caught sleeping under bridges and stuff uh... so they're the show uh... our guys were there and and and my guys are in boston from the tea party or in lexington to be technical they're flying back right now so my two guys handling that story I don't have enough personnel to be up on it will make some phone calls when they get back and see if they can get a hold of uh... in uh...
[00:35:16.907 --> 00:35:18.588]  I heard they cleared all of them out.
[00:35:18.828 --> 00:35:20.188]  Yeah, they clear them all out everywhere.
[00:35:20.668 --> 00:35:22.289]  I'm concerned about where they are.
[00:35:22.749 --> 00:35:25.110]  Well, they're on the streets being hunted down.
[00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:26.350]  They say you can't sleep here.
[00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:29.091]  Okay, when I make a statement, when you're through, is that you answered me?
[00:35:29.432 --> 00:35:29.992]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[00:35:31.712 --> 00:35:43.236]  I've been thinking, there's at least, minimum, 100,000 things that our government is doing to us, hitting us from every direction, and I'm thinking, instead of fighting 100,000 different battles,
[00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:50.415]  Why not we all focus on taking our government back?
[00:35:50.995 --> 00:35:53.998]  And then we won't have to fight a hundred thousand different fights.
[00:35:54.959 --> 00:35:56.040]  Well, I agree.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:59.483]  And when you do, the government, the federal government is ceremonial.
[00:35:59.563 --> 00:36:02.726]  Private banks under international treaties control the U.S.
[00:36:02.806 --> 00:36:10.593]  Our government's fully controlled by the IMF, World Bank, Ex-Im Bank, International Bank of Settlements, World Trade Organization publicly.
[00:36:11.013 --> 00:36:20.484]  So you discredit the New World Order, you call for grand juries, state and federal, to indict the bankers for the crimes they've publicly committed, you take your counties, your cities, your states back.
[00:36:20.624 --> 00:36:26.490]  That's why Fox News is trying to be anti-New World Order now, to pose as opposition to get
[00:36:27.051 --> 00:36:40.335]  The people that are waking up, neutralized under their control, meanwhile the left is calling anybody who's in a state sovereignty or anything terrorist to try to sick the police and military on them, because that's the main threat.
[00:36:40.855 --> 00:36:45.297]  And so take your county, your city, your city council back, organize, pick issues.
[00:36:45.777 --> 00:36:47.238]  And just keep hammering and hammering.
[00:36:47.258 --> 00:36:51.041]  The number one thing is, sir, the people are awake now that they've been conned.
[00:36:51.061 --> 00:36:54.764]  They just don't know how or they don't know one one hundredth of how bad it is.
[00:36:55.185 --> 00:37:03.311]  That's why you have to get a radio show or a website or a local newsletter to create your own group in your area.
[00:37:03.652 --> 00:37:05.313]  None of us are going to fix it by ourselves.
[00:37:05.333 --> 00:37:06.274]  This is a process.
[00:37:07.935 --> 00:37:09.396]  But you arrest the bankers.
[00:37:09.817 --> 00:37:10.998]  You arrest the bankers.
[00:37:11.826 --> 00:37:24.437]  You arrest the bankers, and that's why they're coming out after me all over national news, that's why I'm getting death threats right now like I never have before, and a lot of stuff's coming after me right now, because they know that's their Achilles heel.
[00:37:24.677 --> 00:37:29.681]  They've committed crimes publicly, said opposing is saviors, let's bring them to justice, this can all stop.
[00:37:30.062 --> 00:37:38.249]  Now you'll still have the corrupt apparatus of government there and all the corrupt systems, but for now they won't be able to get their next phase of total global dictatorship in place.
[00:37:39.632 --> 00:37:41.435]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in California.
[00:37:41.475 --> 00:37:42.316]  Robert, you're on the air.
[00:37:44.539 --> 00:37:44.820]  Alex.
[00:37:45.881 --> 00:37:46.141]  Yes.
[00:37:46.842 --> 00:37:47.864]  Thank you for your work.
[00:37:48.184 --> 00:37:51.509]  I found you on the internet about four to five weeks ago.
[00:37:52.503 --> 00:37:55.545]  I wanted to let you know that I'm here in San Diego.
[00:37:56.085 --> 00:37:58.547]  You had had a caller earlier when I was listening.
[00:37:58.567 --> 00:37:59.508]  I've been on hold for a while.
[00:37:59.968 --> 00:38:02.650]  He was talking about alarms going off in Chicago.
[00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:11.996]  Yeah, they've been having in big cities like Dallas and New York, and I've been in New York where it happens, they've been having the air raid sirens go, which haven't been on in decades.
[00:38:12.036 --> 00:38:13.017]  It's all part of the fear.
[00:38:13.837 --> 00:38:15.518]  Well, interesting to let you know.
[00:38:15.558 --> 00:38:17.700]  I just heard this off the newscast this morning.
[00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:33.523]  That Coronado, which is a big military town, they have not, uh, they said the reason they were going to let their, their sirens off were to, uh, because they didn't know if the system was working or not, but I find it, uh, quite interesting that this is happening around the whole United States.
[00:38:36.087 --> 00:38:36.908]  Absolutely, sir.
[00:38:36.928 --> 00:38:40.331]  They're practicing taking over the FEMA control boxes and radio TV.
[00:38:41.031 --> 00:38:51.020]  They're now telling stations, oh, the government's going to be popping in with announcements now, not just about old ladies or kids that are lost, but also terrorists and the weather and other service announcements.
[00:38:51.461 --> 00:38:54.223]  All radio, all TV, Internet's controlled by them.
[00:38:54.683 --> 00:39:01.710]  They're now publicly not just going to have control of the big Internet hubs, but all the small hubs to, quote, shut the web down for our safety, New York Times.
[00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.450]  They're making their move, sir.
[00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:04.751]  They've stolen everything.
[00:39:05.151 --> 00:39:06.772]  They've destroyed us financially.
[00:39:07.172 --> 00:39:13.454]  But Liberty could re-energize and regenerate all this in a matter of years.
[00:39:14.194 --> 00:39:18.556]  But once they kill Liberty, see, they're threatened by new wealth.
[00:39:18.736 --> 00:39:19.796]  They issue the money.
[00:39:20.036 --> 00:39:21.277]  They want to end wealth.
[00:39:21.317 --> 00:39:21.677]  Go ahead.
[00:39:22.972 --> 00:39:24.853]  I'm a Christian, and I've got to say something.
[00:39:24.873 --> 00:39:27.194]  I attended a new... I won't name the church out here.
[00:39:27.214 --> 00:39:33.597]  It's a typical Judeo-Christian church, and I was listening to one of the messages online.
[00:39:33.617 --> 00:39:34.518]  I went to the website.
[00:39:34.558 --> 00:39:38.100]  I missed a couple weeks and wanted to see where the pastor's head was at.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.781]  He's up there on the net.
[00:39:41.385 --> 00:39:48.290]  Talking about this church that he had always went out to speak to, and how they were not prospering.
[00:39:49.451 --> 00:39:52.513]  But to them, prospering is having a big, huge church.
[00:39:52.573 --> 00:39:59.257]  That's what, instead of the gospel and the good news of Jesus Christ, who defeated these evil bastards.
[00:39:59.297 --> 00:40:02.059]  Most Christian searches are voodoo.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.883]  They do rituals, they chant, and they demand from God what they want.
[00:40:07.743 --> 00:40:09.184]  That's what magic is.
[00:40:09.945 --> 00:40:13.088]  Magic is, I'm going to do a ritual and have a little demon give me a piece of gold.
[00:40:13.548 --> 00:40:14.669]  Or, you know, give me power.
[00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:23.657]  And so most of these churches are New World Order, big phallus symbols out front, satanic worship centers.
[00:40:23.697 --> 00:40:25.299]  I mean, and the pastors know that.
[00:40:25.659 --> 00:40:28.723]  They know Easter isn't Easter, it's Ishtar-ia, Ishtar.
[00:40:29.284 --> 00:40:36.272]  They know the eggs and the rabbit, Playboy, you know, is a symbol of sex, the goddess of fertility, they know all that.
[00:40:36.532 --> 00:40:38.094]  These are Satan worshippers!
[00:40:38.475 --> 00:40:40.277]  Of course they're going to sit there and tell you that.
[00:40:40.317 --> 00:40:40.758]  Go ahead.
[00:40:41.567 --> 00:40:45.933]  That's the old Canaanite religion of Balaam.
[00:40:45.953 --> 00:40:46.754]  Oh yeah, and the word...
[00:40:58.679 --> 00:41:00.620]  Folks, that's how Matrix-like it is.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:07.483]  The churches are satanic worship centers for Ishtar, and it's even called Ishtar!
[00:41:08.084 --> 00:41:12.085]  And it's on all the Sun Cycle dates, and they know that, and they don't care!
[00:41:12.586 --> 00:41:13.546]  It's a big joke!
[00:41:13.606 --> 00:41:16.948]  They are Satan worshipers, and they know it!
[00:41:17.008 --> 00:41:17.408]  Go ahead.
[00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:36.389]  Well you're 100% correct, but I went on to their website and I'm listening to this pastor and so he goes out and he visits this church and now all of a sudden this new church is big and he asked the pastor, he said, you know, tell me what was the difference of the church becoming as big as it is with you guys?
[00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:41.014]  He goes, well we had some anti-government people in our church and
[00:41:41.733 --> 00:41:49.054]  I finally came out and said, you know, Romans 13, you're to, you know, that God ordains governments and you're to obey God.
[00:41:49.514 --> 00:41:51.875]  And we've been prospering, you know, prospering ever since.
[00:41:52.015 --> 00:41:52.995]  Bunch of nonsense.
[00:41:53.095 --> 00:41:56.016]  And I told my wife, I said, we are not going to... That means government money.
[00:41:56.456 --> 00:41:57.476]  Go ahead and say the name of the church.
[00:41:57.516 --> 00:41:58.416]  That means government money.
[00:41:59.236 --> 00:42:03.937]  Well, this is a church in San Diego and it's called the City Church.
[00:42:04.417 --> 00:42:09.538]  And I heard it online and after I heard that, I told myself I will not be going back.
[00:42:10.464 --> 00:42:11.244]  Back to that church.
[00:42:11.264 --> 00:42:32.256]  You know, I listen to a lot of stuff online, Pastor Butch Paul, there's Pastor Peters, there's a bunch of preachers that are not controlled by the New World Order, and that's where I get, you know, most of it, unless I'm, you know, reading my Bible for myself, and these small churches, gatherings of people doing home churches, we were doing that back in the 90s.
[00:42:32.896 --> 00:42:35.237]  And one quick thing before I go, Alex, I have a question for you.
[00:42:35.277 --> 00:42:39.640]  I was watching these chemical trails, and we're in a heat wave right now in California,
[00:42:40.487 --> 00:42:44.890]  Is there a chance this garbage that they're putting in the air is making the weather hotter?
[00:42:45.171 --> 00:42:45.431]  No, no.
[00:42:45.471 --> 00:42:47.172]  That's what all the scientists say.
[00:42:47.352 --> 00:42:51.796]  They're trying to create global warming, and you notice when a storm comes in, they block it with the trails.
[00:42:52.076 --> 00:42:53.337]  It's weather modification.
[00:42:53.377 --> 00:42:54.257]  They're now admitting it.
[00:42:54.438 --> 00:42:54.678]  No, no.
[00:42:54.738 --> 00:42:55.939]  They're creating droughts.
[00:42:56.219 --> 00:42:57.460]  They're creating heat waves.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.541]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:01.938]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:43:02.058 --> 00:43:07.239]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:08.740]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:17.183]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:43:17.423 --> 00:43:23.145]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:43:23.325 --> 00:43:25.107]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:43:25.167 --> 00:43:27.348]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:43:27.469 --> 00:43:31.712]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:43:31.872 --> 00:43:33.994]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:43:34.094 --> 00:43:41.861]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:43:42.361 --> 00:43:46.604]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:44:06.412 --> 00:44:11.775]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:44:12.295 --> 00:44:18.478]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:18.698 --> 00:44:20.599]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:20.759 --> 00:44:23.140]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:44:23.221 --> 00:44:34.106]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:44:36.397 --> 00:44:37.658]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:38.058 --> 00:44:39.438]  It's about a one world government.
[00:44:39.919 --> 00:44:46.281]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:44:56.665 --> 00:44:57.846]  The people strike back.
[00:44:59.597 --> 00:45:02.758]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:45:03.098 --> 00:45:04.838]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:45:05.018 --> 00:45:10.359]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:45:10.579 --> 00:45:18.300]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends a life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.

[00:45:49.372 --> 00:45:50.332]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:45:50.352 --> 00:45:51.552]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:45:51.572 --> 00:45:52.712]  Man, I am so fired up right now!
[00:46:15.503 --> 00:46:20.127]  Let's go ahead and just get Steve Quayle right at the start of this next hour.
[00:46:20.147 --> 00:46:22.269]  Go ahead and get him on the line there, John.
[00:46:24.411 --> 00:46:25.932]  Oh man, I am fired up today.
[00:46:28.454 --> 00:46:30.736]  Because I'm past the fear.
[00:46:30.796 --> 00:46:32.057]  I'm going up against the tyranny.
[00:46:32.117 --> 00:46:33.018]  I know I'm in the right.
[00:46:33.298 --> 00:46:34.119]  I've studied the enemy.
[00:46:34.139 --> 00:46:35.160]  I know they're scum.
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:41.085]  I know we don't have any choice but to just really get angry at these people and get focused and get aggressive.
[00:46:42.734 --> 00:46:44.495]  It's our spirit that needs to be fixed.
[00:46:44.535 --> 00:46:48.416]  We need to be fired up, focused, aggressive, and love liberty and goodness.
[00:46:49.236 --> 00:46:58.499]  Instead of having this giggling, slack-jawed, smart-mouthed, you know, worldly, lethargic, know-it-all, arrogant spirit.
[00:46:58.519 --> 00:46:59.480]  You know what I'm talking about.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:05.102]  The people are hungry for the truth, and we gotta give it to them.
[00:47:05.642 --> 00:47:08.203]  Now, before I go back to your calls and Steve Quayle,
[00:47:09.684 --> 00:47:13.006]  I'll tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this world-wide transmission possible.
[00:47:15.687 --> 00:47:16.387]  A Cola Blue.
[00:47:16.487 --> 00:47:17.428]  ColaBlue.com.
[00:47:17.488 --> 00:47:19.129]  Atmospheric water generator for the home.
[00:47:19.189 --> 00:47:22.170]  Pays for itself within one year if you buy your water from the store.
[00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:24.411]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride.
[00:47:24.451 --> 00:47:26.012]  Unlimited water for the humidity in the air.
[00:47:26.412 --> 00:47:27.613]  Knows exactly what you're drinking.
[00:47:27.633 --> 00:47:30.414]  Machine produces up to 28 liters of water in 24 hours, or 7.5 gallons.
[00:47:33.052 --> 00:47:36.956]  The generated water is passed through seven filters, including reverse, osmosis, and carbon.
[00:47:37.436 --> 00:47:39.918]  Simple to use, no chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[00:47:40.399 --> 00:47:41.360]  Neutral pH.
[00:47:42.261 --> 00:47:44.322]  Your own source of clean drinking water.
[00:47:44.903 --> 00:47:58.816]  How the filtering process works, the water passes through an activated carbon filter, and then a silver impregnated carbon filter, then a reverse osmosis system, and it takes an odor removal filter, and it's stored in a tank illuminated by antibacterial, antifungal, UV radiation.
[00:48:01.189 --> 00:48:01.731]  UV light.
[00:48:01.751 --> 00:48:04.939]  I'd like to give you technically what it is.
[00:48:04.959 --> 00:48:06.243]  Nutritive.
[00:48:06.323 --> 00:48:07.466]  Blasting any impurities.
[00:48:08.129 --> 00:48:09.610]  Also SurvivalSeedBank.com
[00:48:38.389 --> 00:48:46.994]  And then in closing for this hour... Man, I'm fired up!
[00:48:47.955 --> 00:48:52.517]  This is what happens when I start making myself go to bed at 11 or 12 at night instead of 2 or 3 in the morning.
[00:48:52.958 --> 00:48:54.158]  And what happens when I start jogging?
[00:48:55.719 --> 00:49:00.242]  That's why it's almost good to not be... My testosterone starts boosting, folks.
[00:49:01.462 --> 00:49:09.686]  I get pretty fired up on air, as I'm naturally just hired in a kite, especially when I'm fighting tyranny and focusing in on the effect we're having on what we're doing.
[00:49:10.926 --> 00:49:11.406]  Listen to me.
[00:49:13.067 --> 00:49:16.809]  We can defeat the New World Order, and just look at the Obama deception.
[00:49:17.209 --> 00:49:23.092]  More than 15 million views, last time I counted it up a week and a half ago, for free on Google and YouTube and everywhere else.
[00:49:23.132 --> 00:49:25.333]  There's one YouTube with a million and a half views that's the best.
[00:49:25.353 --> 00:49:27.874]  It says, Obama deception, high quality.
[00:49:28.234 --> 00:49:33.256]  But why not have the DVD in the very highest quality?
[00:49:33.476 --> 00:49:35.417]  Why not have it and make copies of it?
[00:49:35.457 --> 00:49:38.498]  You know the power of the people being turned loose.
[00:49:38.538 --> 00:49:46.081]  We can beat these bastards if you just believe in history and take action and get a DVD duplicator and buy at least a hundred or two hundred.
[00:49:46.901 --> 00:49:53.204]  blank DVDs and just savagely make copies and give them to people and know that it will shatter the left-right paradigm.
[00:49:53.444 --> 00:49:59.446]  It will show them how both parties are controlled and they won't be able to keep the people divided and confused in the left-right system.
[00:49:59.526 --> 00:50:03.307]  You shatter that, we're very close to defeating these people.
[00:50:03.568 --> 00:50:06.309]  It's their divide and conquer that allows them to control us.
[00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:11.031]  So again, InfoWars.com to order the DVD or all the other great books and films and materials that are there.

[00:51:01.888 --> 00:51:07.752]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:51:07.952 --> 00:51:10.954]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.

[00:51:38.056 --> 00:51:39.557]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:52.245 --> 00:51:54.167]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:54.647 --> 00:51:57.509]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:03.854 --> 00:52:04.515]  Big Brother.
[00:52:05.175 --> 00:52:06.236]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:06.937 --> 00:52:08.117]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:08.698 --> 00:52:09.539]  You want answers?
[00:52:10.279 --> 00:52:11.240]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:15.423]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:16.024 --> 00:52:20.087]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:21.602 --> 00:52:27.170]  Alright, Steve Quayle has a lot of military and police sources, but what he's about to tell you is already confirmed.
[00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:33.999]  Maryland and California papers reported regular army was spying on the tea parties all over the country.
[00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:37.431]  The FBI was out there putting people in databases.
[00:52:37.451 --> 00:52:43.152]  They're even announcing this on the news to create a chilling effect so you think you're not allowed to protest or demonstrate.
[00:52:43.212 --> 00:52:43.812]  It doesn't matter.
[00:52:43.852 --> 00:52:44.812]  Get past the fear.
[00:52:45.172 --> 00:52:46.053]  We're the majority.
[00:52:46.093 --> 00:52:51.794]  If they get us to cower and act all... You know, that's when the Berlin Wall finally fell and folks just didn't care anymore.
[00:52:52.554 --> 00:52:59.176]  We can do this, but this is a cowing, a psi-op, calling the troops terrorists, uh, you know, uh...
[00:53:00.117 --> 00:53:03.438]  Canada Free Press is reporting an FBI spy on Tea Party Americans.
[00:53:04.218 --> 00:53:09.740]  We've posted reports as well about the Army doing this up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.381]  We're going to get into that and so much more for the next hour.
[00:53:12.681 --> 00:53:14.002]  Then Gerald Cilente joins us.
[00:53:14.342 --> 00:53:16.302]  Steve Quayle from SteveQuayle.com.
[00:53:16.562 --> 00:53:18.303]  We'll get his website up on screen as well.
[00:53:18.323 --> 00:53:20.904]  We're simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:21.244 --> 00:53:25.345]  Steve Quayle, it was a powerful show we did last Thursday on your show.
[00:53:25.385 --> 00:53:26.046]  Thanks for having me.
[00:53:26.286 --> 00:53:27.046]  It's good to have you here.
[00:53:27.651 --> 00:53:35.616]  Well, Alex, I think the synergy that was present on the show that you did with me was the one that had to get as much information in the shortest amount of time out.
[00:53:35.656 --> 00:53:51.485]  Because, again, what you have done and what I'm trying to do, and together we're doing it, is giving different sources and combining our sources and our intel-gathering abilities and presenting, I'd say, the most realistic picture to the people that they could ever hope for.
[00:53:51.505 --> 00:53:57.089]  And if they listen to mainstream news, Alex, I'm telling them they're already mind-controlled dead zombies.
[00:53:57.689 --> 00:54:02.632]  Because the mainstream news is nothing more than the mouthpiece of the Illuminati.
[00:54:02.672 --> 00:54:06.375]  And let me go to immediately the story of the FBI spying on the Tea Party Americans.
[00:54:06.975 --> 00:54:17.142]  What most people don't understand is that there's compartmentalized intelligence within all of the areas of the military and all of the national security agencies and their offshoots.
[00:54:17.302 --> 00:54:24.407]  And even to some extent, obviously, the FBI has compartmentalizers, special compartmentalized intelligence.
[00:54:24.907 --> 00:54:40.204]  What happened is a directive went out to the 56 special agents in charge across the country to basically film and to put into the database in Washington, and we'll talk about the restricted access to that database in a moment.
[00:54:40.584 --> 00:54:43.066]  But everybody is basically being targeted.
[00:54:43.106 --> 00:54:47.430]  In other words, the Obama administration is going to quell all First Amendment rights.
[00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:56.837]  I've been told by my sources deep inside that the entire, if you will, patriot movement is to be categorized, is to be cataloged.
[00:54:56.857 --> 00:54:57.798]  And we've known this, Alex.
[00:54:57.838 --> 00:54:58.798]  We've told people this.
[00:54:59.119 --> 00:54:59.939]  But they don't believe us.
[00:55:00.019 --> 00:55:02.982]  Now it's basically mainstream news.
[00:55:03.662 --> 00:55:07.525]  And police should know, they've been categorized, they don't just say troops.
[00:55:07.926 --> 00:55:16.773]  In the more internal documents that I've talked to sources and you don't have to see, but they're so classified, you know, we can't even bring them out here because that's the agreement with sources.
[00:55:17.353 --> 00:55:18.895]  They're classifying police.
[00:55:18.915 --> 00:55:25.620]  I mean, don't just think for a minute they're saying number one threat is veterans and gun owners and leaving cops out that aren't going to play along with this.
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:30.704]  When the Soviet takeover, Nazi takeover happens, they always have purges of the military and police.
[00:55:30.744 --> 00:55:31.105]  Go ahead.
[00:55:31.665 --> 00:55:43.252]  Absolutely, and I want to make it clear, the police and all corresponding people that go along with the purges of the people that were listed by Janet Napolitano are absolutely, they're the blue list.
[00:55:43.272 --> 00:55:44.172]  They get taken out.
[00:55:44.212 --> 00:55:50.676]  That means liquidated, exterminated within 30 to 60 days after helping the powers that be, the New World Order people, to go after us.
[00:55:50.716 --> 00:55:52.697]  Now let me read something because this is important, Alex.
[00:55:52.717 --> 00:55:54.078]  This is really critical, okay?
[00:55:55.330 --> 00:56:00.014]  The information that was collected by the special agents in charge was submitted to Washington.
[00:56:00.054 --> 00:56:02.477]  We're at the level of the National Security Branch.
[00:56:02.517 --> 00:56:14.147]  This information was to include the Office of the Director of Intelligence, the DI, and integrated with a restricted access database, one that reportedly is accessible by only two agencies of the 14 agencies that comprise the U.S.
[00:56:14.207 --> 00:56:16.009]  intelligence community, according to the source.
[00:56:16.744 --> 00:56:22.067]  Over the years, when I have talked about the red and blue list, people always say, well, I want a copy of the list.
[00:56:22.107 --> 00:56:27.210]  Well, it's probably some of the most controlled information or data out there.
[00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:33.574]  It even goes on to say that not all special agents in charge, they weren't to inform everybody within their department.
[00:56:33.594 --> 00:56:42.320]  So this was a national security-directed, intel-gathering event to put into the database to basically come after everybody.
[00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:44.941]  Steve Quill dot com, InfoWars dot com.
[00:56:44.981 --> 00:56:45.862]  Steve, stay there.
[00:56:46.783 --> 00:56:47.644]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:47.964 --> 00:56:52.547]  They're attempting to have a punch, a takeover of the United States.
[00:56:53.248 --> 00:56:54.769]  Then they will kill at least half the country.
[00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.910]  Will they get away with it?
[00:56:59.793 --> 00:57:00.333]  You worry.
[00:57:00.693 --> 00:57:02.434]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:57:02.775 --> 00:57:04.996]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:57:05.417 --> 00:57:07.198]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[00:57:11.059 --> 00:57:17.607]  Isolated from civilization, she knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:57:17.968 --> 00:57:21.292]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:57:21.933 --> 00:57:23.274]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:57:23.635 --> 00:57:26.238]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:57:26.538 --> 00:57:29.482]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:57:29.983 --> 00:57:38.149]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.

[00:57:51.479 --> 00:57:52.840]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:54.582]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:58:00.049 --> 00:58:05.278]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:06.085 --> 00:58:11.429]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:58:11.969 --> 00:58:18.154]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:18.454 --> 00:58:20.275]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:20.435 --> 00:58:22.817]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:58:22.897 --> 00:58:33.765]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:58:36.073 --> 00:58:37.313]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:37.733 --> 00:58:39.134]  It's about a one world government.
[00:58:39.594 --> 00:58:45.955]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:58:46.495 --> 00:58:54.277]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:54.757 --> 00:58:55.918]  The Obama Deception.
[00:58:56.338 --> 00:58:57.518]  The people strike back.
[00:58:59.344 --> 00:59:06.311]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[00:59:06.551 --> 00:59:10.855]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:59:11.116 --> 00:59:16.220]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[00:59:16.721 --> 00:59:23.788]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.

[00:59:29.635 --> 00:59:35.082]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:59:35.502 --> 00:59:40.949]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[00:59:51.194 --> 00:59:53.095]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:59:53.115 --> 00:59:54.656]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:15.535]  Okay, some stations don't hear that first five minutes.
[01:00:15.555 --> 01:00:20.704]  Steve Quayle, recap who you are, what you do for... I've got a lot of new affiliates lately.
[01:00:20.724 --> 01:00:21.846]  Some folks may not know who you are.
[01:00:21.866 --> 01:00:25.211]  Um, just like a lot of folks don't know who I am when I'm on your show.
[01:00:27.062 --> 01:00:28.262]  Tell us a little bit about yourself.
[01:00:28.302 --> 01:00:36.865]  The intel you've got integrates a hundred percent everything you were saying when I was on your show last Thursday was clicking and making connections and we've got all the pieces of the puzzle.
[01:00:37.586 --> 01:00:45.308]  We know it's classic tyranny but the most virulent form ever and we know it's a fast-growing viral infection of tyranny.
[01:00:45.689 --> 01:00:52.051]  We know this is the virulent signature or wavelength or type
[01:00:54.152 --> 01:01:05.522]  I mean, no doubt, this is... Folks, when I get up here and I tell you, they're going to set up a Bank of the World with world carbon taxes on everything you do and ban fireplaces.
[01:01:05.642 --> 01:01:07.184]  It's already happening in many states.
[01:01:08.505 --> 01:01:09.866]  All I'm doing is reading their documents.
[01:01:10.426 --> 01:01:13.849]  You have to understand, these are the people that funded Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot.
[01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:15.991]  They are vicious.
[01:01:17.307 --> 01:01:24.831]  Okay, and we have always been who they want to take down, and they want to do a Ukrainian-type takedown of this nation.
[01:01:24.871 --> 01:01:26.152]  Steve Quayle, you've got the floor.
[01:01:27.933 --> 01:01:28.493]  You've got the floor.
[01:01:28.513 --> 01:01:29.314]  I'm going to just sit back.
[01:01:29.354 --> 01:01:29.494]  Go.
[01:01:30.492 --> 01:01:34.994]  Well, the idea is that you nailed it so correctly, Alex.
[01:01:35.034 --> 01:01:38.836]  This is a slaughter in the preparation mode, okay?
[01:01:39.356 --> 01:01:45.259]  And we've got to basically make as many duplicates of copies of your videos and get them out to everybody.
[01:01:45.299 --> 01:01:47.780]  But here's the thing I think that people need to understand.
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:58.585]  While there is yet a whisper of time to make a difference, you've got to seriously write your Senators, Congresswomen, scream at the top of your lungs, write editorials, get on talk shows, and demand
[01:01:59.165 --> 01:01:59.465]  Yeah, I
[01:02:19.138 --> 01:02:19.718]  We're good to go.
[01:02:46.983 --> 01:02:52.726]  I'm getting half a dozen emails a day from people all around the world that listen to you, listen to I would that people put us up on YouTube.
[01:02:52.766 --> 01:02:53.586]  You're up on YouTube.
[01:02:53.606 --> 01:02:54.326]  I'm up on YouTube.
[01:02:54.666 --> 01:03:06.792]  But the deal is is that people have got to understand this is when you've drawn the attention of the world's population to the occult nature of the Illuminati and the Bohemian Grove and everything.
[01:03:06.872 --> 01:03:12.094]  I don't think people understand once the blood begins to flow, it does not stop.
[01:03:12.214 --> 01:03:14.515]  And I can tell you, I've talked to the highest ranking
[01:03:14.975 --> 01:03:15.516]  We're good to go.
[01:03:32.137 --> 01:03:42.239]  And he said, a retired Navy SEAL friend of his said, get all the guns you can, I'm just telling you what I'm being told, get all the food you can, because very soon the economy is going to be brought to a screeching halt.
[01:03:42.619 --> 01:03:48.801]  So all this yippy-skippy feel-good talk that's out there coming, well things have turned around.
[01:03:48.921 --> 01:03:49.501]  Oh really?
[01:03:49.901 --> 01:03:50.701]  What's changed?
[01:03:50.841 --> 01:03:54.502]  What has changed so dramatically that things have turned around?
[01:03:54.922 --> 01:04:00.463]  The idea, Alex, that the bio-event or nuclear event, very soon, now here's the thing that people have got to realize.
[01:04:01.098 --> 01:04:19.493]  That list that was posted, especially, that you went into great detail with, that we talked about together, you talked about separately, is absolutely the hit piece for vilifying a group of people who will be blamed for what is going to be initiated in this country.
[01:04:20.053 --> 01:04:29.979]  And because the events are going to be so horrific and so awesome, when I say awesome, not in a good sense, but just so overwhelmingly wicked and evil, people will do anything.
[01:04:30.039 --> 01:04:38.324]  They'll clamor, they'll scamper, they'll absolutely run in total amazement at the level of devastation.
[01:04:38.364 --> 01:04:47.029]  Because again, when you and I have detailed the globalist plan to take the population of the world down from 6 billion to 500 million, they're serious about that.
[01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:48.190]  And I want to share something else.
[01:04:48.690 --> 01:05:00.438]  The idea that we're being told anything close to the truth, you've got to get through your minds, ladies and gentlemen, that there is no truth coming out of mainstream news.
[01:05:00.478 --> 01:05:08.463]  Did you see Anderson Cooper, you know, mocking in his gay overtones the entire teabag movement?
[01:05:08.523 --> 01:05:10.884]  You know, that's not what it's called, but that means something.
[01:05:12.005 --> 01:05:20.308]  Anyone on MSNBC, on show after show, it's a talking point, who protests the banks, hates black people, so they're trying to stir up race war.
[01:05:21.268 --> 01:05:24.729]  They're creating division, and that's their talking point.
[01:05:24.749 --> 01:05:33.432]  You're a neo-Nazi if you don't like the bankers, or you're a right-wing extremist when it's the majority, 98% of people in polls are against the bankers.
[01:05:33.472 --> 01:05:35.253]  They're making their move, and Steve, as you know,
[01:05:36.431 --> 01:05:39.955]  They have now called for what we knew they were going to do and predicted they would do on record.
[01:05:40.496 --> 01:05:42.458]  They're going to make it public stock.
[01:05:42.558 --> 01:05:46.783]  The money the federal government put in the banks is going to be public stock.
[01:05:46.883 --> 01:05:49.066]  That means it's being stolen completely.
[01:05:49.853 --> 01:05:51.954]  Absolutely, and this is the thing that people don't understand.
[01:05:52.074 --> 01:05:55.614]  Money always is transferred from weak hands to strong hands.
[01:05:56.155 --> 01:06:06.437]  And the powerhouse now, and I said this ten years ago, Alex, I said China will be built up, the Chinese economy will become the greatest economy in the world at the expense of the American economy.
[01:06:06.517 --> 01:06:12.559]  Our technology, our entire banking system will shift to the East, and obviously that's what Jimmy Rogers has been saying for years too.
[01:06:13.039 --> 01:06:18.360]  But the thing that people don't understand is this is a blueprinted destruction
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.301]  of the American way of life.
[01:06:20.381 --> 01:06:21.481]  That's why they pay!
[01:06:21.522 --> 01:06:23.623]  Listen, I hate to interrupt, but you're right.
[01:06:23.743 --> 01:06:24.783]  Folks, he's not just saying this.
[01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:26.984]  That's why they pay tax incentives to leave.
[01:06:27.365 --> 01:06:28.565]  That's why only the U.S.
[01:06:28.625 --> 01:06:36.269]  and Western Europe and Canada and Australia and New Zealand have to do the carbon cuts they're saying in the next two to ten years or phasing in over the next ten.
[01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:38.791]  That will destroy what's left of our industry.
[01:06:39.211 --> 01:06:41.492]  China and India don't have to make those cuts.
[01:06:41.572 --> 01:06:44.314]  This is designed to shut us down.
[01:06:44.354 --> 01:06:44.714]  Go ahead.
[01:06:45.314 --> 01:06:49.619]  Well, I think the best example of that is the credit fiasco that's going on with credit cards.
[01:06:49.659 --> 01:06:57.028]  And by the way, information came in to me, I think, over the weekend that Chase was down on their credit card processing from people that actually work for Chase.
[01:06:57.428 --> 01:06:59.991]  So I think that what people have got to understand is, look,
[01:07:01.404 --> 01:07:09.654]  We were all sold this bill of goods called, what would you call it, Forever Prosperity, or Prosperity Forever.
[01:07:10.174 --> 01:07:15.981]  And just the houses would never go down, your job is secure, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and go out and borrow 125% of your house or your home's value.
[01:07:18.982 --> 01:07:21.563]  What people don't understand is the court.
[01:07:22.003 --> 01:07:23.463]  This is what's important.
[01:07:24.223 --> 01:07:35.306]  When Angel Rochelle made the statement, give me control of the nation's money and I care not who writes its laws, Jesus said, the love of money is the root of all evil, and I'm saying that they who control the money control the evil.
[01:07:35.666 --> 01:07:44.948]  Look at it now change from those evil bankers that are caught literally, you know, with their 500 million dollar golden parachutes, and now it's all the Patriots fault.
[01:07:45.288 --> 01:07:46.748]  And we're all a bunch of racists, Alex.
[01:07:47.268 --> 01:07:55.693]  I used to write extensively on Cold War scenarios for war, given the access I was given to different documents and people over the years.
[01:07:55.793 --> 01:08:07.659]  And I have sat down with double agents, both the United States government and former Russian agents, after the break of Soviet Union, in public, and they said, you Americans are so stupid, we're going to steal your country.
[01:08:07.699 --> 01:08:09.180]  Now, I'm not just saying this is a Russian thing.
[01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:10.141]  We're good to go.
[01:08:25.154 --> 01:08:27.236]  And by the way, 60 Minutes did a piece on that.
[01:08:27.576 --> 01:08:42.450]  I've told people, you've told people, look, they've got to get out of their 401Ks or IRAs, but the same group of sinister scumbag international elitists are sucking the last dollars out of the American population's pockets by saying, oh, what a buying opportunity, what a bottom line.
[01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:44.832]  You're going to have Gerald Solente on the next hour, aren't you?
[01:08:45.232 --> 01:08:45.433]  Yes.
[01:08:46.133 --> 01:08:49.255]  And Gerald has said, look, it's going to be Revolution Street.
[01:08:49.335 --> 01:08:55.538]  And the thing that's important for people to understand, ladies and gentlemen, I use the term whisper of time left.
[01:08:56.098 --> 01:08:59.220]  And the point is that you have got to stand up.
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:01.081]  You can't just count on Alex Jones.
[01:09:01.121 --> 01:09:01.701]  Well, you can.
[01:09:02.022 --> 01:09:04.403]  You can't just count on me and all the other voices out there.
[01:09:04.723 --> 01:09:05.744]  It's got to be your voice.
[01:09:05.764 --> 01:09:06.844]  And I'm serious, Alex.
[01:09:07.204 --> 01:09:13.688]  Every single veteran should be writing a letter to their congressmen and senators demanding
[01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:16.650]  Janet Napolitano's resignation.
[01:09:44.609 --> 01:09:47.753]  First, and it is the fact, imagine you're the globalist.
[01:09:47.773 --> 01:09:48.674]  They want to bring the U.S.
[01:09:48.694 --> 01:09:48.855]  down.
[01:09:48.895 --> 01:09:50.156]  It's always been their main target.
[01:09:50.397 --> 01:09:52.079]  They've used us as an engine of the New World Order.
[01:09:52.119 --> 01:09:52.820]  Now they're done with us.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.782]  What do they do about 100 million gun owners?
[01:09:55.603 --> 01:09:56.725]  They use that against us.
[01:09:56.765 --> 01:09:59.348]  They can't march out against us, so they destroy the economy.
[01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:05.572]  Crime breaks down, society breaks down, the military is already trained and ready to go out on the streets.
[01:10:06.372 --> 01:10:09.113]  Then they stage shootouts between patriots and the military.
[01:10:09.353 --> 01:10:12.075]  They send the military into missions where the patriots will fight them.
[01:10:12.555 --> 01:10:19.999]  Then, the globalist main enemy that I've been saying for years and now it's public news, the military and the American people kill each other.
[01:10:20.779 --> 01:10:25.361]  That's what three-dimensional real chess in the New World Order is all about.
[01:10:25.601 --> 01:10:28.903]  They are divide and conquer, divide and conquer at multi-levels.
[01:10:29.503 --> 01:10:32.605]  Everything they do is divide liberal from conservative, black from white.
[01:10:33.125 --> 01:10:41.831]  Everything they do is divide military from the people, you know, police from the people, so they can play us off against each other while they sit back offshore and do it.
[01:10:42.191 --> 01:10:48.295]  Steve, what do we do then, knowing they're running the PSYOP and how they're hyping the rioting and all of this and pushing it?
[01:10:48.993 --> 01:10:54.454]  Well, the Brotherhood of Darkness cannot stand the light, but even more than that, there is the ability to resist.
[01:10:54.494 --> 01:10:57.035]  You know, the Bible says, resist the devil and he will flee.
[01:10:57.115 --> 01:11:09.158]  First thing people have got to understand, and you've built this case so many years, Alex, is that this is a supernatural, Lucifer-worshiping cadre of intensely evil people.
[01:11:09.258 --> 01:11:13.839]  And you can't even put evil in the context of the standard understanding of people.
[01:11:13.859 --> 01:11:15.499]  It's basically a thousand Sith Lords.
[01:11:16.533 --> 01:11:20.094]  Well, absolutely, and that I'd add, on steroids, okay?
[01:11:20.354 --> 01:11:20.594]  Yes.
[01:11:21.234 --> 01:11:28.475]  Because, again, the thing that we've got to realize, and not only realize is this, they can be held back.
[01:11:28.515 --> 01:11:42.897]  Whether they can be stopped or not, you and I both know if they go to their Dirty D bag of tricks and use a hyperplague, and for the record, I was the first guy, almost 15 years ago, talking about the reconstitutional 1918 Spanish flu.
[01:11:42.957 --> 01:11:45.498]  No, I know, when I first heard you 15 years ago,
[01:11:46.478 --> 01:11:47.779]  I remember, Steve, everything.
[01:11:47.799 --> 01:11:52.022]  I remember you were saying, you know, 15 years ago, get out of the derivatives, right when they were starting.
[01:11:52.382 --> 01:11:52.802]  Stay there.
[01:11:52.862 --> 01:11:54.644]  Steve Quayle, straight ahead.
[01:11:54.664 --> 01:11:58.006]  A lot of news, a lot of analysis, key information.
[01:11:58.406 --> 01:12:02.709]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:12:03.109 --> 01:12:08.593]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:12:09.173 --> 01:12:09.674]  That's right.
[01:12:09.974 --> 01:12:12.255]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:12:13.649 --> 01:12:19.774]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:12:20.295 --> 01:12:27.981]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:12:28.442 --> 01:12:33.286]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:12:33.926 --> 01:12:36.969]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:12:39.724 --> 01:12:43.846]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:12:44.227 --> 01:12:44.487]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:12:44.507 --> 01:12:46.428]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:12:46.488 --> 01:12:46.808]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:12:47.088 --> 01:12:47.368]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:49.169]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:13:03.493 --> 01:13:05.615]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:13:06.095 --> 01:13:13.122]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:13:13.675 --> 01:13:19.862]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:13:19.882 --> 01:13:22.104]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:13:22.244 --> 01:13:24.667]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:13:24.747 --> 01:13:35.719]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:37.610]  It's not about left or right.
[01:13:37.991 --> 01:13:39.392]  It's about a one world government.
[01:13:39.852 --> 01:13:46.158]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:16:03.933 --> 01:16:05.995]  Steve Quayle.
[01:16:06.015 --> 01:16:14.205]  We know, since at least the late 1970s, everything the federal government has done is prepare for massive emergencies and taking over county and city governments.
[01:16:15.495 --> 01:16:39.969]  John Warner Defense Authorization Act, PDD 51 and others clearly state that the attack is based on the governors and the Congress that the government will, that the illegitimate National Security Council, as the Washington Post reported last month, is basically already in a dictatorship through NORTHCOM, through Space Command, which is, there's a real Space Command, but the public isn't even aware of it even though it's published.
[01:16:40.569 --> 01:16:41.730]  This is the real government
[01:16:42.625 --> 01:16:44.306]  They're gearing up for bird flu.
[01:16:44.826 --> 01:16:49.048]  We know that they put it in the vaccines in Europe, shipped it all over the world.
[01:16:49.468 --> 01:16:54.731]  Suddenly we're getting Reuters and London Telegraph articles about people dying being given the vaccine.
[01:16:55.991 --> 01:16:59.553]  Weird trials where they tell people it's one shot and give it to them and they die.
[01:17:03.174 --> 01:17:05.476]  Do you think we're really coming up to the point where they're going to do it?
[01:17:05.516 --> 01:17:08.337]  Because in my gut, I've never been so upset.
[01:17:09.878 --> 01:17:10.619]  Absolutely.
[01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:19.546]  And Alex, I think the time may have already been telegraphed by FEMA, you know, their national level exercise that's coming on through the 27th or 31st of July.
[01:17:19.566 --> 01:17:21.347]  Are you familiar with that?
[01:17:21.667 --> 01:17:21.928]  Yes.
[01:17:22.768 --> 01:17:27.072]  And the situation that's going to be telling on that, and I think most people need to understand this.
[01:17:27.172 --> 01:17:28.593]  Yeah, tell folks about it and then I'll be aware.
[01:17:29.306 --> 01:17:37.330]  Okay, well, the FEMA national level exercise is going to go on throughout the country, and it's all scaled around domestic terrorism.
[01:17:37.791 --> 01:17:42.493]  Now, why this is critical is because command, control, and communication is the key.
[01:17:43.213 --> 01:17:53.759]  And during an exercise, you and I have always cautioned, and most people are alert enough that listen to us to know now, that when there is an exercise taking place, it could be a cover for the real thing.
[01:17:53.959 --> 01:18:07.267]  Yeah, back in 2000 when they released the weaponized foot-and-mouth, they later admitted accidentally out of Porton down in England, they were doing an exercise around the country, and then magically it popped up in a two-day period where they were doing the exercise.
[01:18:07.908 --> 01:18:17.914]  Absolutely, and so the thing that's important for everyone to recognize, it only takes one command word from NORTHCOM to change it from an exercise into full-scale implementation.
[01:18:18.524 --> 01:18:28.928]  Now Alex, I've been talking to too many people in the background about Henry Kissinger's statement about there will be no private firearms ownership in the United States after September this year.
[01:18:29.048 --> 01:18:33.790]  So if it's going to take 30, 60 days to slaughter everybody they're going to slaughter.
[01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:38.552]  And you know, I get a lot of flack Alec when I talk about this, but I can tell you point blank
[01:18:39.199 --> 01:18:44.604]  Is that right now we're seeing that quelling, or the ending of all First Amendment rights, period, okay?
[01:18:44.844 --> 01:18:54.472]  And now they're getting, we know the government's war gaming, attacking people's systems of the internet, and with Jay Rockefeller saying we'd be better off without the internet.
[01:18:55.073 --> 01:18:55.673]  Absolutely.
[01:18:56.054 --> 01:19:00.778]  And I think the thing is, is that, and I want to share this, I'm going to be posting today later,
[01:19:01.759 --> 01:19:07.443]  Uh, an orange alert, and it's going to, uh, basically make the appeal to everyone who's taking their oath of office.
[01:19:07.463 --> 01:19:24.334]  And I know you've had the Oath Keepers, uh, head guy on and stuff, but what I don't think people understand is that over the next several months, law enforcement and the military are going to be given unlawful, illegal orders and unconstitutional orders to round up and purge dissidents against all the New World Order crowds.
[01:19:24.394 --> 01:19:25.635]  Now you've never talked like this.
[01:19:25.655 --> 01:19:28.739]  Steve, you're saying you believe they're preparing to move.
[01:19:28.999 --> 01:19:32.063]  How do we short circuit them doing that?
[01:19:32.782 --> 01:19:38.486]  Well, first of all, we know for a fact that we've been able to short-circuit by exposing the stuff, okay?
[01:19:38.946 --> 01:19:41.608]  Now, all I know is, Alex, I believe we're buying time.
[01:19:41.628 --> 01:19:43.309]  We're buying time for people to get prepared.
[01:19:43.689 --> 01:19:48.333]  But the fact is, is that the red list, and the red list is still a real list.
[01:19:48.353 --> 01:19:49.333]  You know, it's funny, isn't it?
[01:19:49.633 --> 01:19:56.318]  That we've been getting... Well, they now have the no-fly list with over 1,100,000 totally innocent people on it.
[01:19:56.558 --> 01:19:58.700]  And now they're saying that's going to be a no-buy list.
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:19:59.060]  Go ahead.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:00.000]  You've got it.
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.961]  See, it goes from no-fly to no-buy.
[01:20:02.261 --> 01:20:15.667]  And also, let me share this, all the globals have had to do is stop the importation of goods, and that's why, you know, obviously we're seeing guns, and we're seeing firearms, and ammunition, short supply, blah, blah, blah, but it goes all the way through the whole system.
[01:20:15.687 --> 01:20:18.448]  People are saying they go to this mark, that mark, or any mark.
[01:20:18.468 --> 01:20:22.710]  The military refuses to sell its brass now to the gun manufacturers for ammo.
[01:20:23.050 --> 01:20:27.292]  I've got, if you just Google Homeland Security visits gun owner, thousands of hits.
[01:20:27.432 --> 01:20:28.153]  I did it yesterday.
[01:20:29.053 --> 01:20:30.116]  You bought a thousand rounds.
[01:20:30.216 --> 01:20:30.557]  Why?
[01:20:30.737 --> 01:20:37.253]  Homeland Security, Secret Police arresting people who bought a few thousand rounds of ammo saying it's an arsenal when it's not even against the law.
[01:20:37.274 --> 01:20:37.554]  Go ahead.
[01:20:38.143 --> 01:20:38.323]  Right.
[01:20:38.583 --> 01:20:39.384]  And I want to share this.
[01:20:39.404 --> 01:20:49.651]  People are noticing, and I'm getting massive amounts of data, telling us that checkpoints are being set up on and off ramps, especially in Virginia, south of Washington, D.C.
[01:20:49.671 --> 01:20:51.593]  Now, these are new things, Alex.
[01:20:51.693 --> 01:20:57.397]  Even up here in Montana, you know, we're about probably 40 to 50 miles between any city, if you can call it that.
[01:20:57.417 --> 01:21:01.580]  They've got a regular army popping up when governors say you're not allowed to do this.
[01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:04.022]  In Tennessee, the army still comes out.
[01:21:04.551 --> 01:21:04.852]  Yep.
[01:21:05.733 --> 01:21:08.818]  And again, the thing is, is that what I'm saying is I believe we have the real debt.
[01:21:08.838 --> 01:21:16.171]  Now listen, here's the other thing I'm telling everybody, and I want to make this clear, and I can't go into detail, but you can read between the lines.
[01:21:16.781 --> 01:21:30.407]  The idea, ladies and gentlemen, that if veterans are vilified to ultimately be liquidated, then you've got to understand those with special qualifications are going to be the ones on the first site.
[01:21:30.427 --> 01:21:42.632]  So I'm telling all former combat veterans, Special Forces, Green Berets, Delta, and Special Operations personnel who are out of the service that they must change their physical location.
[01:21:42.992 --> 01:21:44.893]  Now I'm telling you there's a reason why.
[01:21:48.056 --> 01:21:48.476]  Stay there!
[01:21:48.516 --> 01:21:48.897]  Stay there!
[01:21:48.937 --> 01:21:49.317]  Stay there!
[01:21:49.737 --> 01:21:50.638]  We're on the march.
[01:21:51.119 --> 01:21:52.740]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:53.661 --> 01:21:56.344]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:59.679 --> 01:22:02.001]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[01:22:02.141 --> 01:22:05.845]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[01:22:05.945 --> 01:22:08.588]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[01:22:08.768 --> 01:22:15.975]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[01:22:16.095 --> 01:22:16.415]  I'm good.
[01:22:32.552 --> 01:22:36.556]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[01:22:36.696 --> 01:22:41.940]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:22:42.501 --> 01:22:47.425]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[01:22:47.545 --> 01:22:51.549]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:22:52.009 --> 01:22:54.491]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[01:22:54.651 --> 01:22:55.112]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:23:00.157 --> 01:23:05.410]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:11.553]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:23:12.073 --> 01:23:18.277]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:23:18.497 --> 01:23:20.378]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:23:20.538 --> 01:23:22.939]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:23:22.999 --> 01:23:33.885]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:23:36.189 --> 01:23:37.449]  It's not about left or right.
[01:23:37.849 --> 01:23:39.190]  It's about a one world government.
[01:23:39.710 --> 01:23:46.072]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:23:46.612 --> 01:23:54.394]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:54.874 --> 01:23:56.034]  The Obama Deception.
[01:23:56.455 --> 01:23:57.635]  The people strike back.
[01:24:00.052 --> 01:24:05.534]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:24:05.574 --> 01:24:06.094]  and the world.
[01:24:06.354 --> 01:24:09.815]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:24:10.215 --> 01:24:16.477]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:24:16.717 --> 01:24:18.498]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:24:18.758 --> 01:24:26.700]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:31.401]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:24:31.661 --> 01:24:37.202]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[01:24:37.482 --> 01:24:39.482]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[01:24:39.663 --> 01:24:43.043]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you, free of charge.
[01:24:43.343 --> 01:24:45.464]  Dial 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202, or visit our website at ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[01:24:52.125 --> 01:24:55.687]  The United States has had a heads of protection up around it.
[01:24:55.707 --> 01:25:01.270]  Doesn't mean we haven't had wars and hundreds of thousands dead per major war.
[01:25:20.691 --> 01:25:22.232]  Almost like a half million in the Civil War.
[01:25:22.252 --> 01:25:25.653]  A couple hundred thousand in World War I and World War II.
[01:25:28.914 --> 01:25:29.974]  Slavery, all those things.
[01:25:30.114 --> 01:25:34.056]  But the rest of the world is barbarism and enslavement, where thugs run everything.
[01:25:35.116 --> 01:25:37.957]  Now, the big bankers in control engineered the Russian Revolution.
[01:25:37.977 --> 01:25:38.757]  They funded Hitler.
[01:25:38.777 --> 01:25:39.497]  That's on record.
[01:25:39.578 --> 01:25:39.938]  Mao.
[01:25:39.958 --> 01:25:40.618]  Pol Pot.
[01:25:41.898 --> 01:25:43.839]  And they're planning that here, clearly.
[01:25:43.859 --> 01:25:48.701]  I remember telling you ten years ago they had secret dossiers on all gun owners and all this.
[01:25:48.761 --> 01:25:49.581]  Now they just admit it.
[01:25:51.348 --> 01:26:00.090]  They're paying off the preachers, even small preachers, we've confirmed, who have small home churches are getting Homeland Security letters about, remember Romans 13, you do what the government tells you.
[01:26:00.911 --> 01:26:03.211]  And these are, of course, preachers that have been speaking out against the government.
[01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:05.692]  I mean, Steve, this is a secret police.
[01:26:05.732 --> 01:26:12.554]  This is a criminal government that knows it's about to do even more horrible things, so it's trying to get everybody to stand down.
[01:26:13.769 --> 01:26:19.130]  But then they know it's going to blow up into rebellion, and then they're going to call everybody that's standing up terrorists.
[01:26:19.831 --> 01:26:21.971]  My God, this is going to be a horrible situation, Steve.
[01:26:23.251 --> 01:26:29.853]  But, I mean, police, military, former special forces, you're really saying the government's going to come after them?
[01:26:29.893 --> 01:26:32.874]  I mean, where are they going to get these forces in the first wave?
[01:26:32.954 --> 01:26:39.375]  I see them playing us off against each other in the first wave until society breaks down, then going and doing the red and blue list.
[01:26:39.435 --> 01:26:40.916]  But you say you've got other intel.
[01:26:40.956 --> 01:26:41.276]  Go ahead.
[01:26:41.496 --> 01:26:43.358]  We've got other intel, and let me share this.
[01:26:43.459 --> 01:26:49.867]  It comes from the highest realms of the military themselves, and it comes from some of the best placed sources.
[01:26:49.967 --> 01:26:55.214]  And when I say this, you know, look, the deal is, Alex, is that the hunter-killer teams are coming.
[01:26:55.314 --> 01:26:56.916]  NATO has been brought in this country.
[01:26:56.936 --> 01:26:57.437]  Remember when
[01:26:57.817 --> 01:27:03.419]  Secretary of Defense Gates said that they may need to call on NATO to bring in troops because we were deployed all over the world.
[01:27:03.479 --> 01:27:05.400]  We told people that was the plan.
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.201]  To deploy U.S.
[01:27:06.221 --> 01:27:11.683]  troops would be loyal to the United States, our oath to defend the Constitution Bill of Rights, and to bring in NATO troops.
[01:27:12.344 --> 01:27:21.490]  There are agencies that specifically do nothing but literally monitor the whereabouts of all these different individuals.
[01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:22.831]  No, no, we've always known that.
[01:27:22.851 --> 01:27:27.654]  I mean, they constantly spy on the vets who think that doing all these black ops, the government loves them.
[01:27:27.694 --> 01:27:32.838]  They hate you because they know you're going to resist when they try the Soviet-style purge.
[01:27:32.878 --> 01:27:33.238]  Go ahead.
[01:27:33.718 --> 01:27:38.043]  Right, and I think they could have called us BS brokers or whatever.
[01:27:38.083 --> 01:27:39.105]  They've called me worse than that.
[01:27:39.165 --> 01:27:40.266]  I'm sure you've had it worse than that.
[01:27:40.306 --> 01:27:48.436]  But the point is, Napolitano basically validated everything that you and I have been warning about for these past 15, 10 years, whatever.
[01:27:48.796 --> 01:27:51.700]  The point is, ladies and gentlemen, how dare they?
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:28:04.886]  Billify a group of men and women who would lay down their lives for their country, and then turn them into the enemy with the same brush as all those gun owners, those constitutionalists, those patriots, those right-wing terrorists, blah, blah, blah.
[01:28:05.226 --> 01:28:13.870]  If we don't command a lawsuit, a multi-faceted lawsuit against the, and I'm telling you, these are hate crimes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:16.191]  And it shows they're the bad guys!
[01:28:29.758 --> 01:28:34.200]  I mean, look, foreign banks are looting the GDP in six months.
[01:28:35.201 --> 01:28:39.423]  All the production of the country is stolen in half a year for an entire year.
[01:28:40.284 --> 01:28:42.625]  They are just running rampant, stealing everything.
[01:28:42.905 --> 01:28:49.469]  The only reason I think you may be right, they may go hot sooner rather than later, Steve, unless we get the word out like our lives depend on it.
[01:28:50.109 --> 01:28:54.071]  Is because all the rich people for three years have been leaving the United States, and I mean the billionaires.
[01:28:54.531 --> 01:29:05.818]  And I've talked to them, a lot of them live here in Austin, and they're freaked out themselves, going, oh yeah, you don't know the elite, I'm getting the hell out of here, oh yeah, there won't even be an America.
[01:29:06.078 --> 01:29:08.259]  And I go, what do you mean there won't be an America?
[01:29:08.579 --> 01:29:10.480]  And they just said, there won't be an America.
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:13.502]  I don't know what that means, but I just can't believe they're doing this.
[01:29:14.264 --> 01:29:22.449]  Well, they are doing it, Alex, and the problem is that when it becomes so in your face, it's one thing to warn about it for years or a decade or a decade and a half.
[01:29:22.770 --> 01:29:26.072]  It's another thing when everything you've warned about is now present on your plate.
[01:29:26.452 --> 01:29:33.096]  Now, also, the feds are going to tell the military and law enforcement people to send their families to so-called safe zones.
[01:29:33.317 --> 01:29:35.218]  And they're going to say that we're killing...
[01:29:37.199 --> 01:29:40.526]  Steve, this is key and I've always had this thought and researched it and I always forget to say it on air.
[01:29:40.807 --> 01:29:43.933]  They're going to kill some of the select police and military.
[01:29:44.454 --> 01:29:45.937]  I just differ on how many with you.
[01:29:46.775 --> 01:29:47.756]  And then blame it on us.
[01:29:48.016 --> 01:29:48.536]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:29:48.556 --> 01:29:49.036]  Absolutely.
[01:29:49.416 --> 01:29:54.039]  And that's the nature of my orange alert that's going up on my website today, or it may be up tomorrow.
[01:29:54.319 --> 01:29:55.020]  But here's the deal.
[01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:56.580]  Understand this, Alex.
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:30:01.223]  The military and law enforcement are going to be promised the protection of their families, okay?
[01:30:01.663 --> 01:30:07.807]  And then their family members are going to be used as a lever to get them to comply with the illegal orders to kill U.S.
[01:30:07.847 --> 01:30:10.888]  citizens and round them up in family camps and children.
[01:30:11.108 --> 01:30:12.069]  See, remember, we were
[01:30:12.469 --> 01:30:16.976]  Breaking the info about all these kids are going to be locked down in schools and moved to safe zones?
[01:30:18.041 --> 01:30:20.322]  You would do anything to keep your family alive, wouldn't you?
[01:30:20.382 --> 01:30:46.077]  And I remember you saying that twelve, thirteen years ago, myself reporting, and then we got sent footage from places like Missouri and the Ozarks where they load the elementary up with their hands up on buses without telling them where they were going, take them to a FEMA camp and then call the parents and say you've got to come here to pick them up and it was an admitted drill and now the news admits during the collapse of society they are going to have the military and police quote move in to defended camps for themselves
[01:30:46.957 --> 01:30:49.279]  My God, what a sickening plan they've devised.
[01:30:49.699 --> 01:30:55.364]  Well, this is, I think the word sickening, satanic, diabolic, luciferian, wickedness.
[01:30:55.404 --> 01:31:00.708]  Now, Jesus said, and Alex, I'm quoting Jesus, because when he tells it like it is, you don't have to question it like it is.
[01:31:00.748 --> 01:31:05.092]  He said, there's never been a time like it in history, nor would be again.
[01:31:05.132 --> 01:31:09.035]  And I gotta tell you, that upsets me when I... Even worse than the days of Noah.
[01:31:09.595 --> 01:31:10.457]  Absolutely.
[01:31:10.857 --> 01:31:25.198]  And the thing I think that people need to recognize right now is that, look, their hopes, their dreams, their futures, their earning capacity, everything that they've worked hard for all their life has been literally taken away from them.
[01:31:25.558 --> 01:31:32.682]  By the very people that are now using the media and the mouthpieces and the vomit-brokering whores to vilify us.
[01:31:32.743 --> 01:31:37.546]  And remember, they identify, they vilify, they nullify, and now they destroy.
[01:31:37.846 --> 01:31:40.547]  And so what I'm telling people, I could not be more serious.
[01:31:40.928 --> 01:31:43.869]  The lateness of the hour demands that people become active.
[01:31:43.909 --> 01:31:45.510]  They can't let Alex Jones do it.
[01:31:45.751 --> 01:31:47.151]  They can't let Steve Quayle do it.
[01:31:47.191 --> 01:31:49.413]  They can't let whoever their favorite or
[01:31:49.833 --> 01:31:51.094]  Non-favorite talk radio show.
[01:31:51.314 --> 01:31:52.155]  They have to do it.
[01:31:52.235 --> 01:32:00.600]  And see, again, the idea is, listen, they can even tell the level of resistance by how many people complain.
[01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:01.280]  Do you follow me?
[01:32:02.141 --> 01:32:02.321]  Yes.
[01:32:02.401 --> 01:32:03.962]  Only a million people complain.
[01:32:03.982 --> 01:32:05.263]  They go, that's a piece of cake.
[01:32:05.283 --> 01:32:07.024]  They're testing our defenses.
[01:32:07.064 --> 01:32:08.845]  They're testing our picket line.
[01:32:09.385 --> 01:32:09.926]  You got it.
[01:32:09.986 --> 01:32:10.386]  Thank you.
[01:32:10.426 --> 01:32:11.567]  That's what I was trying to say.
[01:32:13.428 --> 01:32:14.388]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[01:32:14.428 --> 01:32:15.769]  So they're testing the picket line.
[01:32:16.029 --> 01:32:18.671]  Now, here's one thing that everyone can take great hope in.
[01:32:19.426 --> 01:32:26.428]  The thing is, is that there is a promise, and there are promises, that they that know the living God shall be strong and do exploits.
[01:32:26.788 --> 01:32:30.049]  There are amazing people, Alex, still in the military.
[01:32:30.089 --> 01:32:31.349]  There are amazing people.
[01:32:31.649 --> 01:32:33.550]  Not all of them are sold out to the devil.
[01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:39.171]  But the problem is, and this is the big issue, I have been told by top-level military brass
[01:32:39.571 --> 01:32:41.672]  Oh no, there's been major news articles written
[01:33:07.501 --> 01:33:12.723]  There's been major articles written about how all these big companies have hired their own armies or produced their own armies.
[01:33:13.083 --> 01:33:29.109]  They've been getting ready for a siege mode for decades, hardening their corporate and government facilities to literally shut the economy down in a Great Depression, but now we're not agrarian, we're not rural, so that that's their main weapon is just shutting everything off.
[01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:29.529]  Go ahead.
[01:33:30.109 --> 01:33:30.710]  Absolutely.
[01:33:30.810 --> 01:33:45.139]  And again, the situation is that, listen, if you're taking assets that should be used to defend the country, and see, this is what I wish the military would understand, especially those who still love this country.
[01:33:45.639 --> 01:33:51.363]  They, basically, a lot of the multi-star generals and stuff that have been gone into retirement or forced into retirement, etc.
[01:33:52.296 --> 01:34:00.080]  They basically are not aware of the degree of subterfuge on the international financial scene.
[01:34:00.481 --> 01:34:12.747]  I have contacts, Alex, in both Beijing and Hong Kong, and they tell me point blank, and you can't get any better connected, that most of the bailout money is being sent overseas to buy commodities.
[01:34:12.767 --> 01:34:15.829]  Then a big story comes on that China's buying all the copper they can.
[01:34:16.189 --> 01:34:18.310]  China knows what's getting ready to happen.
[01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:30.575]  The United States, which has been one of the most amazing producing countries in the world, we've exported in the good days, we exported food, we exported our technology, we exported things that could help people's lives be better.
[01:34:31.056 --> 01:34:38.859]  Then the greed monsters from hell show up and they desire, hey, we're not done just plundering the United States, we've got to plunder the planet.
[01:34:39.199 --> 01:34:39.279]  Yes.
[01:34:39.299 --> 01:34:39.700]  No, you're right.
[01:35:09.842 --> 01:35:11.503]  You've got to do everything you can do.
[01:35:11.563 --> 01:35:17.727]  Those of you in the military that are given an unlawful and unconstitutional order, at the time it's given, that's the point you have to deal with it.
[01:35:18.127 --> 01:35:26.172]  And I'll let the imaginations of those... Getting back to something you said, why Special Forces, Delta, all the guys that have specialized training, because they can teach others.
[01:35:26.592 --> 01:35:30.634]  And this is the thing, Alex, too many coincidences.
[01:35:30.694 --> 01:35:37.278]  Right now, the Criminal Investigation Division of the military is investigating a couple Army deaths at one of the Army hospitals.
[01:35:37.298 --> 01:35:42.080]  Well, they're constantly killing the Delta Force people when they come back.
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:46.702]  And I saw a report, suicides are at like 10 times, I think it was even higher.
[01:35:46.722 --> 01:35:48.923]  I just Googled record military suicides.
[01:35:48.963 --> 01:35:51.465]  It was just astronomical, off the charts.
[01:35:51.825 --> 01:35:54.546]  Most of these aren't suicides, they're killing people.
[01:35:55.106 --> 01:35:59.889]  Absolutely, and isn't there a big story by Seymour Hersh about a former high-level U.S.
[01:35:59.969 --> 01:36:02.550]  Vice President that was heading up the hit squads?
[01:36:03.661 --> 01:36:04.281]  Absolutely.
[01:36:04.801 --> 01:36:07.262]  And so ladies and gentlemen, here's the thing.
[01:36:07.742 --> 01:36:08.822]  Here's the thing you've got to do.
[01:36:08.842 --> 01:36:10.623]  You've got to turn off the bloody TV.
[01:36:11.163 --> 01:36:12.603]  I call it the zombie machine.
[01:36:12.943 --> 01:36:18.865]  That zombie machine is a mind-controlling, neuro-linguistic programming device.
[01:36:18.905 --> 01:36:19.865]  That's why they're even bigger.
[01:36:19.925 --> 01:36:27.747]  Alex, you walk into Costco, you know, 100 TVs, basically, you know, 40, 50 inches, whatever big they are, right there, beaming out, streaming out.
[01:36:27.767 --> 01:36:28.507]  But what I don't think
[01:36:28.507 --> 01:36:44.242]  Hey, I took RTF 15 plus years ago and they openly admitted there was subliminals in billboards, radio, TV, all the big productions, and then they admit the flicker rate, the way they put all the different screens on there, they'll have like 10 screens behind them, where you're
[01:36:44.542 --> 01:36:47.364]  Conscious mind can't pick it all up, but your subconscious mind kicks in.
[01:36:47.664 --> 01:36:49.606]  Then the info beams right in.
[01:36:49.626 --> 01:36:53.809]  I mean, they've got multi-layers of propaganda and programming.
[01:36:53.849 --> 01:37:01.315]  And I catch myself watching Obama listing when he does that perfect cadence, when he goes, uh, uh, and I can't even do it like he does it.
[01:37:01.595 --> 01:37:06.659]  And then I read top neuro-linguistic programmers that are, you know, mainstream scientists working for governments.
[01:37:06.919 --> 01:37:08.220]  They say he's a master at it.
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:11.483]  He's up there literally hypnotizing people.
[01:37:12.769 --> 01:37:18.134]  And this is something, again, before people boo-boo or say, oh, you're both crazy, here's the thing.
[01:37:18.754 --> 01:37:29.243]  You know, the people that were fat and sassy with a heavy retirement and, you know, half a million dollar house in Austin and no worries, now they're out on the streets, not only in Austin, but all the major cities in the United States.
[01:37:29.423 --> 01:37:30.924]  Ask yourself this, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:31.884 --> 01:37:42.069]  How is it that everybody who saw it coming, and those of us who were warning about it way before even Peter Schiff and Gerald came on the scene, we've been warning about it, but we were all as marginalized.
[01:37:42.589 --> 01:37:45.250]  Now the bottom line is the Illuminati's out in such plain sight.
[01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:46.911]  You know, Alex, you've heard the same thing I've heard.
[01:37:47.211 --> 01:37:48.792]  There's nothing you can do to stop us.
[01:37:48.932 --> 01:37:49.732]  That's their threat.
[01:37:50.353 --> 01:37:51.973]  You know, we don't care what you tell.
[01:37:52.094 --> 01:37:52.814]  It's too late.
[01:37:53.334 --> 01:37:58.418]  Well, I remain tainted as long as somebody's got breath and the will and the desire to take their oath seriously.
[01:37:58.438 --> 01:38:02.961]  You know, even God says, don't take an oath haphazardly.
[01:38:03.021 --> 01:38:05.162]  Let your yays be yays and your nays be nays.
[01:38:05.202 --> 01:38:07.904]  For any more than that proceeds out of that, that's sin.
[01:38:08.044 --> 01:38:08.925]  It's simply stated.
[01:38:09.665 --> 01:38:12.527]  You're saying an oath is something that someone binds themselves to.
[01:38:12.947 --> 01:38:21.513]  And so the new oaths that are being bounced out there, you know this, is that under the new administration, oaths will not be taken to the Constitution or pledged to the Constitution.
[01:38:21.533 --> 01:38:22.514]  I want to make a statement.
[01:38:23.052 --> 01:38:42.189]  When the very images of historic Christianity are covered up at the College of Georgetown by request of the White House, and a pyramid is placed over that image on a black banner, and the President of the United States is basically the head in the middle of the pyramid, let me share with us what that means.
[01:38:42.449 --> 01:38:43.630]  Let me stop you, let me stop you.
[01:38:43.650 --> 01:38:44.711]  Here comes the New World Order.
[01:38:45.492 --> 01:38:47.954]  Yeah, start over, because I want to put that on screen.
[01:38:48.535 --> 01:39:00.027]  Guys, because we're at PrisonPlanet.TV, Google Georgetown University, White House request, Christian images taken down, Georgetown University, or White House request, removal of Christian.
[01:39:00.527 --> 01:39:02.609]  And then put it up and show folks the Black Pyramid.
[01:39:02.669 --> 01:39:03.150]  Exactly.
[01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:05.732]  They didn't just remove the cross.
[01:39:06.092 --> 01:39:07.754]  They brought in the Black Pyramid.
[01:39:08.074 --> 01:39:09.656]  Explain to people what that means.
[01:39:09.676 --> 01:39:11.738]  Hierarchical mass death.
[01:39:12.078 --> 01:39:16.662]  Here is our man on the black horse, the man on the white horse.
[01:39:17.363 --> 01:39:18.264]  It's bringing you death.
[01:39:18.444 --> 01:39:19.165]  Start over, Steve.
[01:39:19.745 --> 01:39:22.428]  Well, again, the idea was that prior to
[01:39:23.498 --> 01:39:32.082]  The President speaking at Georgetown, the request was made by the White House and by the staffers that all Christian imagery be covered up.
[01:39:32.542 --> 01:39:39.605]  Not only that, but especially the IHS, the very presentation of Jesus behind the place that Obama would be speaking.
[01:39:40.065 --> 01:39:46.207]  Now, to put a black pyramid up there, the pyramid is the ultimate, go to your dollar bill, ladies and gentlemen, the New World Order.
[01:39:46.588 --> 01:39:52.470]  Basically, Alex, what that meant, and I'm telling you, the Luciferian symbology is the old
[01:39:53.050 --> 01:39:55.192]  Epic, or the old days are over.
[01:39:55.873 --> 01:40:00.316]  On to the stage, stage right, comes the new deliverer, okay?
[01:40:00.837 --> 01:40:03.339]  It's not enough to just put that imagery up there.
[01:40:03.719 --> 01:40:08.984]  The ramification is that Obama is typing, or being typed, with the all-seeing eye on the pyramid.
[01:40:09.484 --> 01:40:11.786]  The eye of Horus, H-O-R-U-S.
[01:40:12.346 --> 01:40:16.050]  And not only that, that's probably the most in-your-face slap-against-heaven.
[01:40:16.838 --> 01:40:29.502]  I'm not privy to the conversations going on in heaven right now, and I'm not being a wise guy when I'm saying this, but of all the insults that I think could ever be levied against the Lord Jesus Christ, that has to be one of the most dramatic.
[01:40:29.542 --> 01:40:31.043]  Now let me share this to the people.
[01:40:31.861 --> 01:40:33.382]  A man who is superstitious.
[01:40:33.462 --> 01:40:35.522]  Obama carries talismans in his pocket.
[01:40:35.562 --> 01:40:38.643]  He paid papers out of them to the reporters.
[01:40:38.663 --> 01:40:39.003]  Remember that?
[01:40:39.043 --> 01:40:40.664]  He had a little monkey god named Hanuman?
[01:40:41.024 --> 01:40:42.885]  He carries the same talismans.
[01:40:43.205 --> 01:40:46.406]  Remember the big sports team owner in Memphis?
[01:40:46.806 --> 01:40:50.767]  And those rumors there were little talismans up in a pyramid, up in the top of the pyramid?
[01:40:51.748 --> 01:40:52.728]  We have the news articles.
[01:40:53.268 --> 01:40:56.532]  When they opened it up, it's the same talismans that Obama carries.
[01:40:56.572 --> 01:40:57.974]  They put it in Time and Newsweek.
[01:40:58.334 --> 01:41:00.096]  These are high satanic talismans.
[01:41:00.356 --> 01:41:03.400]  So exactly, it isn't just, oh, get that Jesus out from behind me.
[01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:05.282]  He believed that would lessen his power.
[01:41:05.322 --> 01:41:05.743]  Go ahead.
[01:41:06.223 --> 01:41:07.505]  Yeah, and now you nailed it.
[01:41:07.565 --> 01:41:08.546]  It's power, Alex.
[01:41:09.147 --> 01:41:10.528]  Power is the quintessence.
[01:41:10.548 --> 01:41:19.533]  Look, I've known millionaires, I've known billionaires, I've talked to people that I don't know any of the trillionaires, but I know the people that work for the trillionaires, and there are trillionaires.
[01:41:19.934 --> 01:41:24.917]  The thing is, is that when you take a talisman, you are invoking the power of that.
[01:41:25.457 --> 01:41:28.659]  And the invocation of the power, you know the last person to do that in history?
[01:41:29.119 --> 01:41:30.020]  On a major level?
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:30.740]  Hitler.
[01:41:31.021 --> 01:41:31.401]  Yeah, Hitler.
[01:41:31.501 --> 01:41:32.782]  And he did it in Berlin.
[01:41:33.002 --> 01:41:36.344]  And ladies and gentlemen, if you want to read a great book, read The Third Reich and The Occult.
[01:41:36.972 --> 01:41:39.495]  Because, again, what I'm saying, Alex, is this.
[01:41:40.236 --> 01:41:45.501]  Even in the Bible, when evil spirits are cast out, they go and seek someone else to possess, okay?
[01:41:46.122 --> 01:41:49.625]  I wonder, personally, where that spirit that left Hitler was.
[01:41:50.086 --> 01:41:53.269]  When I saw who was speaking in Berlin, I didn't have to wonder anymore.
[01:41:53.329 --> 01:41:56.673]  Well, you know, he literally went to Hitler's favorite speaking spot.
[01:41:57.153 --> 01:41:57.693]  You got it!
[01:41:58.294 --> 01:42:06.279]  And behind him was a seat of, what was it, it was called the, oh goodnight, the seat of Satan that Jesus spoke about in the book of Revelation.
[01:42:06.699 --> 01:42:11.222]  And the actual, I don't know if you know this, but it resided in Pergamos, which is in Turkey.
[01:42:11.522 --> 01:42:17.166]  It was brought to the Berlin Museum, and a copy of it was literally behind him as he spoke to Berlin.
[01:42:17.506 --> 01:42:18.327]  No, I did know that.
[01:42:19.233 --> 01:42:30.561]  Well, and see, this is the thing, Alex, it's amazing how many years you've been talking about the Bohemian Grove, the Bohemian Grove, the occult nature of the Illuminati, and to have such a luministic symbols right thrown in your face.
[01:42:30.982 --> 01:42:38.367]  I gotta tell you, brother, I don't know if there are any, seriously, I don't know, the thing that makes me curious is the ministers in this country.
[01:42:38.667 --> 01:42:39.908]  That should be speaking the truth.
[01:42:39.928 --> 01:42:47.975]  They're now being castigated, castrated, and silenced by the... Well, I mean, I mean, you know, we've got a lot of atheists and agnostics listening, even if they don't believe in God.
[01:42:47.995 --> 01:42:54.701]  Our point is, as a scientific, historical fact, the elites do, and they believe in Satan and destruction and blood.
[01:42:55.342 --> 01:42:56.243]  I mean, it's a fact.
[01:42:57.003 --> 01:42:57.444]  Look out!
[01:42:59.958 --> 01:43:00.818]  Spring is here.
[01:43:01.078 --> 01:43:01.858]  Growing season.
[01:43:02.038 --> 01:43:04.019]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:43:04.219 --> 01:43:05.639]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:43:05.939 --> 01:43:06.599]  Think about it.
[01:43:06.919 --> 01:43:10.760]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.501]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:43:14.761 --> 01:43:16.381]  The country is running out of food.
[01:43:16.641 --> 01:43:19.222]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:43:19.482 --> 01:43:29.664]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you
[01:43:29.944 --> 01:43:30.164]  I think so.
[01:43:59.904 --> 01:44:05.210]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:05.710 --> 01:44:12.698]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:44:13.286 --> 01:44:19.468]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:19.868 --> 01:44:21.709]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:21.849 --> 01:44:24.270]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:35.294]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:44:35.914 --> 01:44:37.214]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:37.594 --> 01:44:38.955]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:44:39.446 --> 01:44:45.791]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:46.351 --> 01:44:54.136]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:54.617 --> 01:44:55.778]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:56.198 --> 01:44:57.459]  The people strike back.
[01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:01.922]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[01:45:02.552 --> 01:45:05.514]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[01:45:05.874 --> 01:45:09.296]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[01:45:09.656 --> 01:45:15.840]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:21.283]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.

[01:45:56.654 --> 01:45:57.554]  Then Carol Cilente.
[01:45:57.594 --> 01:46:02.957]  We'll take a few calls.
[01:46:03.037 --> 01:46:05.299]  Lenny Brock and others that are calling for him.
[01:46:11.769 --> 01:46:16.373]  I also want to encourage listeners to realize that now is the time to take action.
[01:46:16.453 --> 01:46:18.054]  People are ready to hear the truth now.
[01:46:18.754 --> 01:46:25.640]  Everything that they heard us talk about for years, almost everybody out there has heard Steve or myself or, you know, he goes coast to coast all the time on his own show.
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.704]  They've heard myself or a half dozen other folks out there that get the big picture.
[01:46:30.724 --> 01:46:31.304]  Steve gets it.
[01:46:31.985 --> 01:46:33.986]  And he even adds a lot that I didn't know over the years.
[01:46:34.006 --> 01:46:34.727]  I've learned a lot from him.
[01:46:34.747 --> 01:46:35.427]  We appreciate him.
[01:46:37.049 --> 01:46:38.650]  Now is the time to reach out to people.
[01:46:39.130 --> 01:46:39.391]  Even if
[01:46:40.871 --> 01:46:42.052]  You think it's all over, folks.
[01:46:42.112 --> 01:46:43.972]  It's the will to fight, the will to stand up.
[01:46:44.012 --> 01:46:44.873]  That's what saves you.
[01:46:45.693 --> 01:46:46.814]  Life is about the choice.
[01:46:47.574 --> 01:46:48.514]  And God hates cowards.
[01:46:48.554 --> 01:46:49.615]  I'll tell you that right now, folks.
[01:46:49.675 --> 01:46:51.035]  And it's so good to fight evil.
[01:46:51.275 --> 01:46:52.196]  It's what you're meant to do.
[01:46:52.236 --> 01:46:53.316]  That's why you're not fulfilled.

[01:47:05.967 --> 01:47:10.009]  This film is literally sending shockwaves across the nation right now.
[01:47:10.089 --> 01:47:11.810]  Let's intensify that even more.
[01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:17.172]  Let's get a reprieve for Nineveh, so we have more time to wake up more people.
[01:47:17.512 --> 01:47:18.553]  Let's reverse this thing.
[01:47:19.513 --> 01:47:23.455]  Let's try to lessen the strikes of the New World Order, you know, on our head with their hammer.
[01:47:24.756 --> 01:47:25.816]  It's just so important.
[01:47:25.836 --> 01:47:27.597]  So, Infowars.com or toll-free 888-253-3139, 888.
[01:47:35.458 --> 01:47:40.581]  Q-U-A-Y-L-E dot com.
[01:47:40.941 --> 01:47:46.484]  And Alex, my orange alert is posted.
[01:47:47.004 --> 01:47:47.865]  I mean every word of it.
[01:47:47.945 --> 01:47:50.947]  And I also want to get one thing in before I sign off with you.
[01:47:51.287 --> 01:47:58.151]  We're getting reports from all over the country that census takers are showing up, but they're not showing up at every home in the neighborhood.
[01:47:58.191 --> 01:48:01.433]  They're selectively showing up and taking GPS readings.
[01:48:01.874 --> 01:48:13.356]  They seem to be going off another list and somebody that had this happen said he and his neighbor are both gun owners and they were the only two in the neighborhood that had that happen.
[01:48:15.151 --> 01:48:21.317]  Now, of course, they could be going off the ATF Form 4s, or 4473s, or whatever, you know, as file with whomever.
[01:48:21.777 --> 01:48:37.112]  But I suggest, ladies and gentlemen, that you do not identify, vilify, and make them the brunt of all the world's evil, like Janet Napolitano did, without the ultimate object of being the destruction of everyone.
[01:48:37.192 --> 01:48:38.253]  And, Alex, I agree with you.
[01:48:38.673 --> 01:48:41.715]  We buy every second of time we can for people.
[01:48:41.755 --> 01:48:49.519]  We buy every minute, every hour, every day as one more moment of God's infinite mercy, pleading with people to see what's coming down.
[01:48:49.539 --> 01:49:06.048]  You know, listen, when THE God is out there, those who worship Satan ought to figure out that obviously if Satan hates God and Satan identifies that God, Christians, and Jesus are his enemies, then maybe there's another side to the story besides the one they've been indoctrinated with all these years.
[01:49:06.994 --> 01:49:26.503]  Alex, we're at the latest point in all time, and given the rhetoric is increasing, and I tell you this, we know actions follow rhetoric, but ladies and gentlemen, if you will step up, if you will absolutely, as veterans, let your voices be heard, and those of you who will not step up, then at least help the veterans financially.
[01:49:26.823 --> 01:49:31.185]  Some of these men and women, who are some of the most amazing men and women in the world, are on the streets.
[01:49:32.345 --> 01:49:34.931]  I'm going to hold you over one more minute and take a few calls.
[01:49:34.951 --> 01:49:36.233]  You got time for that?
[01:49:44.687 --> 01:49:49.148]  But going back to him saying, cover up the name of Jesus in the church where he was going to speak.
[01:49:49.929 --> 01:49:53.130]  I mean, politicians have always gone and spoken at churches, even if they're not even Christians.
[01:49:53.970 --> 01:49:54.290]  Right.
[01:49:54.370 --> 01:49:55.430]  This is a message.
[01:49:55.670 --> 01:49:56.971]  You know, they do this on purpose.
[01:49:56.991 --> 01:49:59.291]  This is a highly religious man.
[01:49:59.611 --> 01:50:00.652]  People say he's a Muslim.
[01:50:00.692 --> 01:50:01.552]  No, he's not a Muslim.
[01:50:01.572 --> 01:50:02.452]  He's a Luciferian.
[01:50:02.912 --> 01:50:03.093]  Right.
[01:50:03.173 --> 01:50:04.613]  The promised one has come.
[01:50:05.153 --> 01:50:07.934]  And if you take the, if you understand, okay.
[01:50:08.641 --> 01:50:14.125]  When the Illuminists talk about the Great One or the Promised One, they're not talking about the Messiah.
[01:50:14.426 --> 01:50:20.370]  They're talking about the literal, physical incarnation of Lucifer on the planet.
[01:50:20.650 --> 01:50:25.374]  You're saying you believe, the Illuminists believe, he is the Antichrist?
[01:50:25.414 --> 01:50:34.841]  I don't know that he's the Antichrist, but I'm telling you, if they look at him, now remember, there's a time in the Bible where the Antichrist is the Antichrist, and then he gets literally possessed by the devil.
[01:50:36.202 --> 01:50:37.603]  Ah, you're saying he's a prototype.
[01:50:41.226 --> 01:50:43.327]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:43.827 --> 01:50:48.269]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:49.890]  Hello, friends.
[01:50:49.950 --> 01:50:50.871]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:50:51.011 --> 01:50:55.633]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:55.733 --> 01:50:58.494]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:50:58.695 --> 01:51:01.576]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:51:01.756 --> 01:51:07.599]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:51:07.819 --> 01:51:10.761]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:11.062 --> 01:51:17.967]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:51:18.047 --> 01:51:21.190]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:51:21.330 --> 01:51:21.530]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:51:21.590 --> 01:51:23.011]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.

[01:51:36.501 --> 01:51:38.002]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:51:38.042 --> 01:51:38.463]  Take action today.
[01:51:38.483 --> 01:51:40.304]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:51:52.196 --> 01:51:54.097]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:54.557 --> 01:51:57.499]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:05.363]  Final segment with Steve Quayle.
[01:52:05.403 --> 01:52:10.405]  Vanity Fair came out this month with a cover story.
[01:52:10.686 --> 01:52:12.446]  I have the magazine.
[01:52:12.526 --> 01:52:16.809]  It admits that Christian conservative leaders go and have gay orgies there.
[01:52:17.429 --> 01:52:20.891]  And that they do rituals, but it goes on to say it's fun and no big deal.
[01:52:24.195 --> 01:52:28.456]  Now again, people can say, oh, Bohemian Grove, they're just having fun.
[01:52:28.496 --> 01:52:30.676]  No, they take it seriously.
[01:52:30.716 --> 01:52:34.157]  These people are lunatics.
[01:52:35.418 --> 01:52:36.418]  Gerald Salente coming up.
[01:52:36.478 --> 01:52:37.958]  A few calls for Steve Quayle, quickly.
[01:52:38.338 --> 01:52:39.738]  Have your question ready, please.
[01:52:40.259 --> 01:52:41.419]  Lenny in New York.
[01:52:41.959 --> 01:52:43.259]  Lenny and then Brock.
[01:52:43.299 --> 01:52:44.500]  That'll be it for calls for Steve.
[01:52:44.540 --> 01:52:45.140]  Go ahead, Lenny.
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:46.520]  Hey, what's up, man?
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:50.901]  I heard you heard just the call and right our officials and have our voices be heard, and I agree, but...
[01:52:51.414 --> 01:52:57.537]  Since the one quote against the bailout in October and Congress still passed it, I just have no confidence in our officials.
[01:52:58.567 --> 01:53:01.449]  Well, I agree with that, but the thing is we're all demanding one thing.
[01:53:01.469 --> 01:53:05.831]  We're demanding that Napolitano step down and resign.
[01:53:06.312 --> 01:53:13.116]  And why I'm saying this is that if everyone will focus on a specific individual who has targeted them, the pressure.
[01:53:13.196 --> 01:53:15.537]  This is one thing Washington does respond to.
[01:53:15.918 --> 01:53:20.160]  And I'll go on to basically say, Alex, I'm saying all we can do is buy time.
[01:53:21.581 --> 01:53:21.981]  Absolutely.
[01:53:22.001 --> 01:53:24.203]  We called 1,000 to 1 against the bailout and they still
[01:53:45.689 --> 01:53:46.269]  No, they have an agenda.
[01:53:46.289 --> 01:53:49.070]  They're going to go through with this.
[01:53:49.590 --> 01:53:54.991]  But it's got to be on record that they're criminals doing the opposite of what the people in the Constitution and the law says.
[01:53:55.192 --> 01:53:56.012]  Appreciate your call.
[01:53:56.072 --> 01:53:56.952]  Correct, Steve?
[01:53:57.392 --> 01:53:58.212]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:53:58.993 --> 01:54:00.373]  Yeah, I mean, we've got to continue to fight.
[01:54:01.133 --> 01:54:02.133]  Brock in Long Island.
[01:54:02.153 --> 01:54:03.094]  Brock, you're on the air.
[01:54:03.894 --> 01:54:04.954]  Oh, hi, Alex and Steve.
[01:54:05.134 --> 01:54:06.895]  You know, I had just a couple questions.
[01:54:06.935 --> 01:54:11.096]  You know, one question I had was, you know, we've been talking about fighting the new world order.
[01:54:12.799 --> 01:54:16.282]  And I was thinking, you know, how about we use our systems against them?
[01:54:16.783 --> 01:54:25.951]  For example, like, what if we were to open our own bank and then be able to use fractional reserve to create funds and to be able to create... Well, they have many regulators, they will let you...
[01:54:27.833 --> 01:54:36.360]  They won't even let the Liberty... Even if we were to have, like, you know, I mean, everybody on the Alex Jones Show as depositors and taking the money out of the major banks... Sir, sir, they will send a hit team to kill you.
[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:37.781]  They've done it to hundreds of people we know of.
[01:54:38.261 --> 01:54:43.745]  Or you could even be selling silver coins and saying it's a new monetary system, which is not illegal.
[01:54:44.086 --> 01:54:45.227]  They still SWAT team you.
[01:54:45.247 --> 01:54:46.087]  Look at the Liberty dollar.
[01:54:46.127 --> 01:54:46.648]  Steve, tell him.
[01:54:47.108 --> 01:54:47.888]  Well, absolutely.
[01:54:47.928 --> 01:55:00.193]  The bottom line is that, listen, the power to tax and the power to basically print money are the two most powerful, when I say this, earthly powers that the Illuminati basically controls.
[01:55:00.293 --> 01:55:02.774]  Jesus said the love of money is the root of all evil, the control of it.
[01:55:03.094 --> 01:55:05.335]  So the point is, that is their power source.
[01:55:05.355 --> 01:55:09.817]  They bribe, they kill, they steal, they distort, they absolutely use money.
[01:55:09.917 --> 01:55:15.119]  And then when they acquire the power, look, it's why you can... They shut the money supply off!
[01:55:15.459 --> 01:55:19.763]  As soon as they get the power, they shut it off to you, so everything implodes, so they can come consolidate.
[01:55:19.783 --> 01:55:20.603]  Steve, great point.
[01:55:20.904 --> 01:55:23.726]  But just in closing, Brock, I'm not knocking you for the idea.
[01:55:24.346 --> 01:55:27.069]  That's why... Nor am I. Exactly.
[01:55:27.949 --> 01:55:30.051]  If you start becoming successful, they come after you.
[01:55:30.271 --> 01:55:34.715]  If you're some town or city with your own script, and it's only being used here and there, they leave you alone.
[01:55:34.955 --> 01:55:36.736]  But if it gets popular, they come after you.
[01:55:36.756 --> 01:55:37.157]  Right, Steve?
[01:55:37.597 --> 01:55:38.158]  Absolutely.
[01:55:38.198 --> 01:55:42.921]  That's what we're seeing with the whole Tea Party movement, with what we've put up on the site and we've talked about on the show today.
[01:55:43.622 --> 01:55:43.802]  Yeah.
[01:55:43.822 --> 01:55:44.543]  Brock, anything else?
[01:55:45.151 --> 01:55:46.192]  Yeah, you know, I just had one more question.
[01:55:46.212 --> 01:55:48.073]  You had mentioned about getting out of your IRA.
[01:55:48.093 --> 01:55:53.697]  I mean, do you recommend just getting, you know, completely cashing it out and paying the penalties and just having the money out of it?
[01:55:53.717 --> 01:55:54.117]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:55:54.137 --> 01:56:00.021]  Steve, Steve and Gerald Salente and all our guests that are real experts said get out when it was $14,000 three years ago.
[01:56:00.041 --> 01:56:03.364]  Now it's probably going to run back up, maybe to $9,000 or $10,000.
[01:56:03.404 --> 01:56:05.885]  Then there'll be an even bigger plunge next time.
[01:56:05.925 --> 01:56:06.566]  Steve, do you agree?
[01:56:07.122 --> 01:56:13.329]  I agree Alex, the bottom line is they only put the best bait in the biggest trap and that's what this is.
[01:56:13.349 --> 01:56:15.171]  This is a baiting going on right now.
[01:56:15.472 --> 01:56:21.659]  Look, everybody is absolutely urged by me to get control.
[01:56:21.779 --> 01:56:25.583]  I've talked to people who have lost millions of dollars Alex, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands.
[01:56:25.823 --> 01:56:27.805]  And I said, why wouldn't you listen to me two years ago?
[01:56:27.826 --> 01:56:28.466]  You know what they said?
[01:56:28.787 --> 01:56:31.550]  Because my broker said, you guys are all nutcases.
[01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:32.631]  Well, guess what?
[01:56:32.851 --> 01:56:39.058]  When you're a 70-year-old woman and lost two million bucks, maybe the nutcases have more flavor to offer than the lying shill.
[01:56:39.858 --> 01:56:40.439]  Exactly.
[01:56:40.519 --> 01:56:41.179]  Thank you, Brock.
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:43.502]  Steve Quayle, I want to have you back in the near future.
[01:56:43.582 --> 01:56:44.102]  God bless you.
[01:56:44.122 --> 01:56:45.003]  SteveQuayle.com.
[01:56:45.203 --> 01:56:46.244]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:56:47.305 --> 01:56:47.625]  Bye-bye.
[01:56:48.266 --> 01:56:49.107]  Amazing individual.
[01:56:49.187 --> 01:56:49.928]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:56:49.968 --> 01:56:58.656]  This is the GCN Radio Network, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, Gerald Cilente, and your calls and a lot of news straight ahead.
[01:57:00.635 --> 01:57:02.177]  You are a rebel, admit it.
[01:57:02.518 --> 01:57:05.301]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[01:57:05.502 --> 01:57:07.565]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[01:57:07.885 --> 01:57:11.590]  Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[01:57:11.830 --> 01:57:14.514]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot, and you can count
[01:57:18.268 --> 01:57:20.549]  Alex Jones is working to save that very country.
[01:57:20.589 --> 01:57:21.170]  So go ahead, be a rebel.
[01:57:21.190 --> 01:57:22.951]  Put in a food supply from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:57:22.971 --> 01:57:25.512]  Everyone will realize you were not a nutcase after all.
[01:57:54.822 --> 01:58:05.244]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:58:05.744 --> 01:58:12.745]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:58:13.306 --> 01:58:19.467]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:58:19.907 --> 01:58:21.728]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:58:21.868 --> 01:58:24.290]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:58:24.370 --> 01:58:35.316]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:58:35.956 --> 01:58:37.237]  It's not about left or right.
[01:58:37.617 --> 01:58:39.018]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:58:39.478 --> 01:58:45.702]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:58:54.661 --> 01:58:55.783]  The Obama Deception.
[01:58:56.223 --> 01:58:57.425]  The people strike back!
[01:58:59.747 --> 01:59:03.128]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:59:03.268 --> 01:59:08.470]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:59:08.650 --> 01:59:13.432]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:59:13.812 --> 01:59:24.936]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:59:25.336 --> 01:59:30.879]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:59:31.100 --> 01:59:37.183]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:59:37.363 --> 01:59:38.024]  What about you?
[01:59:38.404 --> 01:59:44.448]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:59:59.344 --> 02:00:08.447]  She would never say where she came from.
[02:00:08.527 --> 02:00:13.368]  Yesterday don't matter if it's gone.
[02:00:17.722 --> 02:00:43.011]  While the sun is bright Or in the darkest night No one knows She comes and goes Goodbye Ruby Tuesday Who could hang her name
[02:00:49.263 --> 02:01:12.151]  He's been one of the top press forecasters in the world for decades, but now, I mean, I was in the studio last night and saw him on ABC Broadcast TV, you know, talking about what was coming and happening, and then I got home and I saw him on CNN, and then I was online and I saw clips of him on Fox this weekend, getting massive attention, but they're doing little short soundbites.
[02:01:12.171 --> 02:01:13.292]  They've got this Russia Today,
[02:01:16.074 --> 02:01:21.039]  Where, you know, they talk to him for 11 minutes, he has a chance to really roll out and lay out what's happening and going on.
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:32.391]  He predicted the 87 stock market crash, he predicted the fall of, you know, so many other things, the rise, and he is on with us for the next 52 minutes.
[02:01:32.431 --> 02:01:37.796]  Gerald Cilente is a United States Trends Forecaster, Author, and CEO of the Trends Research Institute, founded in 1980.
[02:01:38.897 --> 02:01:42.199]  He is noted for predicting the 87 stop market crash in the fall of the Soviet Union.
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:47.943]  So he is a close combat practitioner with a black belt, trainer whose practice reflects his proactive philosophy.
[02:01:47.963 --> 02:01:50.405]  He's a self-described political atheist.
[02:01:50.745 --> 02:01:53.147]  I look at things for the way they are, not the way I want them to be.
[02:01:53.787 --> 02:01:56.069]  And, Gerald, let's talk about that.
[02:01:56.089 --> 02:01:58.170]  He's been on Oprah Winfrey, you name it, the Today Show.
[02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:10.318]  I told the story before you were here with us about I see all the people that work at a local radio station I do a Sunday show out of and back when I was bashing Bush that was popular and trendy they liked me and would talk to me.
[02:02:10.739 --> 02:02:18.726]  Now one of them won't even talk to me and then sits out in the control room talking crap whenever I'm bashing Obama saying he's a puppet.
[02:02:19.693 --> 02:02:23.855]  Because they have invested their psychology, who they are, their identity with him.
[02:02:24.135 --> 02:02:27.196]  They've been suckered by the con man and can't admit it.
[02:02:27.616 --> 02:02:30.037]  This is so infantile and so sad.
[02:02:30.057 --> 02:02:36.019]  So it's not even that they're stupid, they are under the mind control of this system, aren't they?
[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:38.881]  Well, you've really put it perfectly.
[02:02:39.301 --> 02:02:47.704]  Before we go on, I want to thank you for including me in your wonderful production, The Obama Deception.
[02:02:48.887 --> 02:02:55.011]  And I applaud you also for putting it out there so quickly, cleanly, and accurately.
[02:02:55.891 --> 02:03:00.414]  And I'm honored to be a part of it and having that opportunity.
[02:03:00.834 --> 02:03:01.054]  Great.
[02:03:01.074 --> 02:03:02.115]  You've had a chance to see it.
[02:03:02.135 --> 02:03:02.975]  I mean, give us your review.
[02:03:03.475 --> 02:03:03.756]  All right.
[02:03:03.796 --> 02:03:04.376]  That's what I said.
[02:03:04.416 --> 02:03:05.196]  I think it's excellent.
[02:03:05.216 --> 02:03:07.658]  You know, I'm honored to be a part of it.
[02:03:08.018 --> 02:03:11.280]  And as I said, I applaud you for getting out there quickly and
[02:03:17.262 --> 02:03:19.543]  And pointing out what a deception this is.
[02:03:19.603 --> 02:03:21.124]  This is a song and dance show.
[02:03:21.724 --> 02:03:23.685]  And you aptly said it.
[02:03:24.005 --> 02:03:28.687]  People have psychologically invested in this agent of change.
[02:03:29.608 --> 02:03:46.376]  And when you look at the people who he's brought in, for example, to fix the financial problems, such as Geithner and Orszag and Summers, Clinton retreads Robert Rubin protégés,
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:55.126]  It's like bringing in Meyer Lansky, Machine Gun Kelly, and Bugsy Siegel to win the war on crime.
[02:03:55.846 --> 02:04:00.650]  I mean, these are the same criminals that made it happen, and now they're going to fix it.
[02:04:01.130 --> 02:04:07.635]  So what happens is, and we see this, the liberals are bigger hypocrites than the conservatives.
[02:04:07.675 --> 02:04:09.857]  The conservatives believe they're lying.
[02:04:10.297 --> 02:04:12.679]  If they want to go to war, you know, they'll go to war.
[02:04:12.939 --> 02:04:14.620]  You know, we're going to go kick butt.
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:16.021]  They believe that they'll do it.
[02:04:16.638 --> 02:04:18.299]  Right or wrong, they believe it.
[02:04:18.799 --> 02:04:22.320]  The liberals, on the other hand, they're the bigger hypocrites.
[02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:28.962]  They make every excuse that you could imagine for Obama sending more troops to Afghanistan.
[02:04:29.202 --> 02:04:31.603]  We're 21,000 now, and I love it.
[02:04:32.063 --> 02:04:35.344]  The last 4,000, they're really not troops, they're advisors.
[02:04:35.704 --> 02:04:36.664]  What am I, an imbecile?
[02:04:36.704 --> 02:04:38.085]  I grew up during the Vietnam War.
[02:04:38.405 --> 02:04:40.466]  I remember those advisors as well.
[02:04:40.986 --> 02:04:44.527]  But they say things like, well, he inherited this situation.
[02:04:45.171 --> 02:04:47.252]  They always make excuses.
[02:04:48.392 --> 02:04:53.454]  They've drank the Kool-Aid and their brains have been washed.
[02:04:54.074 --> 02:04:57.956]  And they refuse to see what a big lie this is.
[02:04:58.496 --> 02:05:04.158]  He is the antithesis of everything that liberals believe.
[02:05:04.518 --> 02:05:10.100]  Look what's going on now with the finding about the CIA torture.
[02:05:10.641 --> 02:05:13.402]  And they say, oh no, no, we're not going to prosecute them.
[02:05:14.002 --> 02:05:14.442]  Why not?
[02:05:14.867 --> 02:05:18.228]  If it was you or I that did this, then we would be brought to justice.
[02:05:19.308 --> 02:05:34.052]  But there's always an excuse the liberals will give for giving Obama, who we have decided, we're writing about it in the next edition of our Trends Journal, that he is really the worst of Clinton and the best of Bush.
[02:05:36.413 --> 02:05:37.033]  Explain that.
[02:05:38.018 --> 02:06:02.684]  Well, the worst of Clinton in that this is the guy, you know, that Clinton being the guy that really destroyed our economy, he pushed through NAFTA and globalization that George Bush I and Ronald Reagan couldn't get through, with the great promise with him and Al Gore that this was going to create more jobs and elevate our standard of living.
[02:06:03.144 --> 02:06:05.565]  And of course it did nothing to do that.
[02:06:05.945 --> 02:06:06.945]  It drove us down
[02:06:07.803 --> 02:06:11.407]  In reverse, this has nothing to do with free trade.
[02:06:11.827 --> 02:06:27.183]  All it had to do with was opening up markets to slave labor opportunities so that CEOs could get their products made by slaves and ship them back overseas so they could make those absorbent salaries that they've got.
[02:06:27.611 --> 02:06:33.134]  And that's phase one, then it also vertically integrates the economy and creates a wasteland back in the U.S.
[02:06:33.194 --> 02:06:36.556]  and Western Europe so the bankers can come back in and buy everything up, correct?
[02:06:37.116 --> 02:06:37.516]  Correct.
[02:06:37.637 --> 02:06:38.957]  And that's the other Clinton one.
[02:06:39.378 --> 02:06:41.439]  Let's remember again who he's brought in.
[02:06:41.899 --> 02:06:46.902]  Machine Gun Kelly, Bugsy Siegel, and Meyer Lansky.
[02:06:47.902 --> 02:06:56.467]  And when you look at these guys, these are the Clinton crew that destroyed the Glass-Steagall Act, the banking act that was put in place
[02:06:57.102 --> 02:07:05.547]  So the banksters couldn't get in the brokerage business, and they would do traditional banking, and the casinos couldn't gamble.
[02:07:06.067 --> 02:07:25.639]  These are the same gangsters that deregulated the financial equity business so that they could come up with all these so-called exotic financial instruments such as derivatives, credit swap defaults, and you name whatever else that nobody knows what they're talking about.
[02:07:26.007 --> 02:07:29.409]  These are the same people under Clinton.
[02:07:29.469 --> 02:07:38.076]  And then, of course, you know, Clinton, you know, people forget that he was bombing Iraq just about, what, on a weekly basis for almost eight years.
[02:07:38.496 --> 02:07:48.503]  And when Madeleine Albright was asked by Leslie Stahl on CBS's 60 Minutes if the sanctions against Iraq were worth the death
[02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:57.563]  Of over 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of 5, according to the UN, she said, quote, it was worth the price.
[02:07:57.863 --> 02:08:00.904]  So that's the worst of Clinton, without going into more of it.
[02:08:01.364 --> 02:08:05.766]  And then the best of Bush is, he keeps keeping these wars going.
[02:08:06.186 --> 02:08:11.868]  On Easter weekend, when nobody was paying attention to the news, when I say nobody, the majority,
[02:08:12.932 --> 02:08:17.655]  He asked for more money to wage the Iraq War and the Afghan War.
[02:08:17.695 --> 02:08:19.576]  He's keeping these wars going.
[02:08:19.996 --> 02:08:23.758]  Innocent people are being killed in Iraq for false reasons.
[02:08:24.238 --> 02:08:29.781]  The reasons that Bush gave us was that there were ties to Al-Qaeda and weapons of mass destruction.
[02:08:29.861 --> 02:08:31.122]  Both of them are false.
[02:08:31.762 --> 02:08:35.064]  So, he's the... and also the rendition.
[02:08:35.104 --> 02:08:38.866]  He's keeping that going where you could... Oh, we're closing Guantanamo.
[02:08:38.906 --> 02:08:40.947]  We'll just send them overseas to get tortured.
[02:08:41.428 --> 02:08:43.610]  Oh, and look what he's doing with the wiretapping.
[02:08:43.630 --> 02:08:48.275]  He's defending Bush's wiretapping excesses.
[02:08:48.595 --> 02:08:55.802]  He's actually expanding it, and if you look at total troop numbers, first they said instantly he'll bring the troops on, then 16 months, then 23.
[02:08:56.202 --> 02:08:58.744]  Now his top generals are saying, maybe never.
[02:08:59.065 --> 02:09:06.432]  Maybe we'll just keep 150,000 in Iraq, but they've already doubled Afghanistan, so total, it's an increase.
[02:09:06.892 --> 02:09:07.913]  Across the board.
[02:09:08.413 --> 02:09:19.122]  And you talk to the leftists, they're not really even leftists, they're just literally buying this Madison Avenue creation, and they say, well, he, you know, at least it's him doing it now.
[02:09:19.543 --> 02:09:20.764]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[02:09:21.184 --> 02:09:21.524]  It is.
[02:09:21.665 --> 02:09:23.786]  It's hypocrisy, as I said.
[02:09:24.067 --> 02:09:28.951]  And you aptly pointed it out, that he's increasing the Bush wiretapping excesses.
[02:09:29.331 --> 02:09:31.373]  He's doing everything that the liberals hate.
[02:09:32.013 --> 02:09:34.095]  And again, it's this song and dance
[02:09:34.568 --> 02:09:36.229]  America, I mean, look at this guy.
[02:09:36.269 --> 02:09:42.074]  I mean, can you imagine a president appearing with comics on a late night comic show like Jay Leno?
[02:09:42.354 --> 02:09:43.435]  Where's the dignity?
[02:09:43.475 --> 02:09:46.157]  But they'll do anything to push it through.
[02:09:46.177 --> 02:09:48.959]  Hey, what do you think about him lying about everything?
[02:09:48.979 --> 02:09:59.366]  I mean, not just big issues, but bowing, grabbing his hand, bowing all the way straight down, and then saying, oh, I dropped something on the floor, oh, I was, he was too short when the guy's almost as tall as him.
[02:09:59.626 --> 02:10:01.748]  He clearly bows and then lies about it.
[02:10:02.779 --> 02:10:05.041]  Well, look what Sarkozy said about him.
[02:10:05.061 --> 02:10:13.027]  This is when he made the news as well, when he talked about basically what a lightweight Obama is.
[02:10:14.678 --> 02:10:20.421]  They said he's a groveling, kiss-butt fake, total lightweight who just literally just grovels.
[02:10:20.441 --> 02:10:23.722]  And then Sarkozy said, look, all he does is put out rhetoric.
[02:10:24.123 --> 02:10:25.083]  It's not even real.
[02:10:25.463 --> 02:10:29.985]  They're actually going to keep all their missiles, but he's running around saying they're going to slash them.
[02:10:30.365 --> 02:10:31.946]  And Sarkozy doesn't even care about that.
[02:10:31.986 --> 02:10:37.709]  The point is he just said this guy, even in private meetings, is a complete liar and a complete groveling lightweight.
[02:10:38.664 --> 02:10:50.967]  Again, you hit it right on the numbers, and when we look what's happened to America, and this is one of the trend alerts that we put out, is we're calling for an intellectual revolution.
[02:10:51.027 --> 02:10:59.888]  People better get smart about this and stop listening to comics and clowns and buffoons and conmen.
[02:11:00.288 --> 02:11:02.489]  And that's what we call Obama.
[02:11:02.509 --> 02:11:05.129]  He's the conman in chief.
[02:11:08.634 --> 02:11:24.520]  You go to any of these liberal websites, or any of the websites, even newspapers, they quote what Colbert said about this or that, what Jon Stewart said, what Olbermann said, what Hannity said.
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:27.081]  How about what Mulally and Curley said?
[02:11:27.101 --> 02:11:33.343]  I mean, these people, they're experts on nothing, and they spew out about everything.
[02:11:34.534 --> 02:11:35.815]  You know, you hit on something there.
[02:11:35.835 --> 02:11:38.317]  He puts this fake, jolly laughing.
[02:11:38.337 --> 02:11:40.778]  He was on 60 Minutes and keeps laughing at the reporter.
[02:11:41.159 --> 02:11:43.941]  And the reporter looked at him and it was real.
[02:11:43.961 --> 02:11:44.301]  He could tell.
[02:11:44.341 --> 02:11:47.163]  He said, Are you drunk or something?
[02:11:47.383 --> 02:11:48.124]  Are you punch drunk?
[02:11:48.644 --> 02:11:54.368]  And Obama was just spewing this fake... I mean, it's totally fake.
[02:11:54.408 --> 02:11:55.329]  Gerald Solenday, stay there.
[02:11:55.349 --> 02:11:58.631]  You've been saying this is a fascist country and there needs to be a revolution.
[02:11:59.753 --> 02:12:03.014]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[02:12:03.254 --> 02:12:07.576]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[02:12:07.776 --> 02:12:15.659]  It's called ProtoGrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[02:12:15.979 --> 02:12:18.803]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[02:12:19.103 --> 02:12:26.633]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[02:12:26.734 --> 02:12:32.321]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[02:12:32.541 --> 02:12:38.105]  ProtoGro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[02:12:38.385 --> 02:12:41.687]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[02:12:41.927 --> 02:12:45.290]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[02:12:45.510 --> 02:12:50.573]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the ProtoGro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[02:12:50.593 --> 02:12:53.455]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:12:53.475 --> 02:12:53.675]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:13:00.091 --> 02:13:05.345]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:13:06.139 --> 02:13:11.462]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:13:12.002 --> 02:13:18.205]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:13:18.505 --> 02:13:20.326]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:13:20.466 --> 02:13:22.867]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:13:22.928 --> 02:13:33.833]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:13:36.121 --> 02:13:37.382]  It's not about left or right.
[02:13:37.782 --> 02:13:39.183]  It's about a one world government.
[02:13:39.644 --> 02:13:45.969]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:13:54.816 --> 02:13:55.976]  The Obama Deception.
[02:13:56.397 --> 02:13:57.578]  The people strike back.
[02:13:59.173 --> 02:13:59.613]  Gold.
[02:13:59.953 --> 02:14:01.234]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:14:01.494 --> 02:14:07.576]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:14:07.756 --> 02:14:11.578]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:14:11.938 --> 02:14:13.818]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:14:13.879 --> 02:14:16.159]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:14:16.319 --> 02:14:23.202]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker and
[02:14:23.342 --> 02:14:33.309]  Every day, Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.
[02:14:33.469 --> 02:14:34.590]  Don't gamble with your future.
[02:14:34.750 --> 02:14:38.973]  Call Midas Resources today and ask for your free copy of As Good As Gold.

[02:14:48.017 --> 02:14:54.019]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[02:14:54.199 --> 02:14:55.560]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:15:00.041]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:15:00.221 --> 02:15:01.642]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:15:01.962 --> 02:15:04.143]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:15:04.643 --> 02:15:09.388]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:15:09.789 --> 02:15:12.632]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[02:15:12.972 --> 02:15:16.476]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.

[02:15:29.428 --> 02:15:31.409]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[02:15:31.429 --> 02:15:32.730]  I use one every day.
[02:15:33.150 --> 02:15:35.611]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[02:15:35.911 --> 02:15:37.411]  Call Ecolablue right now at 1-800-691-6043.
[02:15:37.431 --> 02:15:37.732]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[02:15:37.752 --> 02:15:39.772]  Or visit Ecolablue at ecoloblue.com today.
[02:16:08.447 --> 02:16:13.054]  Alright, I want to move through a lot of quick questions for Gerald Cilente.
[02:16:13.555 --> 02:16:15.979]  We'll take a few of your calls too before he leaves us at 1-800-25 at 99231.
[02:16:22.182 --> 02:16:35.690]  Obama's job, and I want to see if you agree with this, sir, is to stall the left long enough for the banks to end up sanguinating or sucking the nation dry, and to also drive a left-right wedge.
[02:16:35.710 --> 02:16:42.313]  You notice how the media is trying to say anybody who protests the taxes is a racist, period.
[02:16:42.353 --> 02:16:46.636]  That's been a talking point on CNN and MSNBC, like parrots.
[02:16:48.733 --> 02:16:52.875]  Well, the left is going to stay with Obama regardless of what he does, just like they did with Clinton.
[02:16:52.895 --> 02:16:54.536]  As I said, the liberals are bigger hypocrites than the
[02:17:17.864 --> 02:17:18.844]  than the Conservatives.
[02:17:18.884 --> 02:17:21.285]  The Conservatives believe what they're doing.
[02:17:21.345 --> 02:17:24.366]  The Liberals turn blind eyes and make excuses.
[02:17:25.106 --> 02:17:35.189]  On the issues of the tax revolts and how they've divided this between left and right, it's very important to understand what's going on here.
[02:17:35.889 --> 02:17:46.752]  In the sense that, if you go back to our Trends Journal, and this went out in December of 2007 for our top trends coming up,
[02:17:47.426 --> 02:17:51.167]  In the coming years, one of them was tax revolts.
[02:17:51.247 --> 02:17:56.068]  Now remember, Bush was president when we wrote this, and this is what we said.
[02:17:57.048 --> 02:18:06.070]  It was the reason for starting the first American revolution, and as the trends add up, it will also be a reason for starting the second.
[02:18:06.890 --> 02:18:17.192]  Fed up and not willing or able to take it anymore, overtaxed Americans will begin the battle against politicians and bureaucrats
[02:18:17.890 --> 02:18:21.371]  In the fight to lower and or repeal taxes.
[02:18:22.231 --> 02:18:25.812]  This has nothing to do with Obama.
[02:18:26.432 --> 02:18:36.954]  This has to do with property taxes, school taxes, sin taxes, hassle taxes, sales taxes.
[02:18:37.434 --> 02:18:39.755]  People are losing their jobs.
[02:18:40.115 --> 02:18:42.035]  They're losing their homes.
[02:18:42.575 --> 02:18:45.596]  They've lost, Alex, in the last year
[02:18:46.155 --> 02:18:50.477]  Eleven trillion dollars worth of wealth.
[02:18:51.878 --> 02:18:57.400]  The American people in terms of stocks and lost values in their homes.
[02:18:58.121 --> 02:18:59.561]  That's what this is about.
[02:18:59.861 --> 02:19:03.003]  This has nothing to do with left or right.
[02:19:03.563 --> 02:19:08.626]  And what's happening are different people out there are exploiting it.
[02:19:09.346 --> 02:19:13.668]  Particularly the politicians and some of the people in the media.
[02:19:14.249 --> 02:19:15.630]  This is not a left-winger.
[02:19:16.251 --> 02:19:24.798]  What we called it was the coalition of the cash-strapped will lead a mainstream American tax battle.
[02:19:25.099 --> 02:19:26.720]  We wrote this in 2007.
[02:19:27.501 --> 02:19:33.446]  So we always get a kick out of how the people that didn't see it coming
[02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:39.145]  Are now saying what it's all about and then they proclaim what's going to happen next.
[02:19:39.545 --> 02:19:42.068]  History was made.
[02:19:42.108 --> 02:19:42.628]  History was made.
[02:19:42.648 --> 02:19:43.649]  Startover has interrupted you.
[02:19:43.970 --> 02:19:49.955]  Then we have Janine Garofalo on CNN and the Rachel Maddow on MSNBC.
[02:19:49.995 --> 02:19:53.619]  What a disgusting, snotty little thing she is.
[02:19:53.699 --> 02:19:57.583]  My God, that snooty little... Oh, I watched that with...
[02:19:58.433 --> 02:20:03.255]  It felt like, you know, I couldn't stand Howard Cosell in the old days when I used to watch that stuff.
[02:20:03.575 --> 02:20:06.056]  And I wanted to smash the television.
[02:20:06.396 --> 02:20:14.599]  When I heard her going on with her snide little tea-bagging routine that she must have said a hundred times in ten minutes.
[02:20:15.159 --> 02:20:17.240]  You know, it's again, it's those people.
[02:20:17.782 --> 02:20:22.966]  That are trying to deride everyone that this is a pocketbook issue.
[02:20:23.266 --> 02:20:25.128]  This has nothing to do with ideology.
[02:20:25.148 --> 02:20:37.978]  Well, that's what I was going to say next, and she cold-bloodedly knows that, and Oberman was there, I lost all respect for him, knowingly saying that we were engaged in weird fellatio, for those that don't know, that's what the teabagging thing is, to see national TV.
[02:20:38.098 --> 02:20:40.020]  Anderson Cooper was doing it on CNN.
[02:20:40.740 --> 02:20:43.902]  And then she said they're all racist, they hate black people.
[02:20:44.303 --> 02:20:48.906]  That is the racism she is injecting into the middle of a tax revolt.
[02:20:49.146 --> 02:20:51.107]  People going bankrupt, losing their homes.
[02:20:51.127 --> 02:20:53.669]  12.8 trillion stolen in six months.
[02:20:53.969 --> 02:20:55.490]  Foreign banks looting everything.
[02:20:56.471 --> 02:20:59.833]  We're on the verge of riots and she injects race into it.
[02:21:00.113 --> 02:21:06.878]  So poor black folks, when they see people out there protesting, even though there's a lot of black folks there, think it's a giant Ku Klux Klan rally.
[02:21:07.278 --> 02:21:10.320]  Is that not literally psychological terror?
[02:21:11.521 --> 02:21:13.144]  This is what they're trying to do.
[02:21:13.184 --> 02:21:25.722]  Did you hear this Axelrod, this David Axelrod, the senior White House advisor, calling... He said that the Tea Party movement is, quote, unhealthy.
[02:21:26.277 --> 02:21:31.079]  You know, this has to go down as one of the 10 dumbest statements ever made in history.
[02:21:31.379 --> 02:21:32.019]  Stay right there.
[02:21:32.179 --> 02:21:32.659]  Stay right there.
[02:21:32.679 --> 02:21:33.920]  Gerald Salente is our guest.
[02:21:33.980 --> 02:21:35.280]  It's an absolutely amazing interview.
[02:21:35.641 --> 02:21:42.883]  Let's come back and talk about your statements on Russian television and on ABC News about revolution in the United States.
[02:21:43.383 --> 02:21:44.484]  Gerald Salente is our guest.
[02:21:44.504 --> 02:21:45.724]  We'll give you his website when we come back.
[02:21:45.744 --> 02:21:46.185]  Stay with us.
[02:21:49.606 --> 02:21:50.526]  We're on the march.
[02:21:51.006 --> 02:21:52.507]  The empire's on the run.
[02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:56.219]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:59.773 --> 02:22:03.056]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:22:03.216 --> 02:22:07.300]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:18.911]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[02:22:19.151 --> 02:22:24.977]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[02:22:25.217 --> 02:22:25.837]  We're good to go.
[02:22:47.793 --> 02:22:48.053]  We're good.
[02:23:03.263 --> 02:23:05.385]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:23:05.886 --> 02:23:12.894]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:23:13.474 --> 02:23:19.641]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:23:20.041 --> 02:23:21.882]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:23:22.022 --> 02:23:24.444]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:23:24.524 --> 02:23:35.471]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:23:36.092 --> 02:23:37.392]  It's not about left or right.
[02:23:37.773 --> 02:23:39.154]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:23:39.634 --> 02:23:45.858]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:23:54.789 --> 02:23:55.929]  The Obama Deception.
[02:23:56.369 --> 02:23:57.550]  The people strike back!
[02:23:59.528 --> 02:24:00.949]  So you want to stop smoking.
[02:24:00.989 --> 02:24:02.110]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[02:24:02.270 --> 02:24:05.032]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[02:24:05.152 --> 02:24:08.975]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[02:24:09.155 --> 02:24:12.697]  And if, and only if, you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it.
[02:24:12.918 --> 02:24:14.879]  Most likely, if you try this, you'd be arrested.
[02:24:14.919 --> 02:24:18.822]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the smoke-free free trial offer is.
[02:24:19.222 --> 02:24:26.006]  Smoke Free is a complete all-natural stop smoking system and when you call today they'll send you a 30-day supply of the program absolutely free.
[02:24:26.286 --> 02:24:35.372]  This program eliminates withdrawals and cravings and includes a 30-day supply of the Smoke Free Capsules, a guide to living smoke-free book, an audio support program, capsule holder,
[02:24:35.592 --> 02:24:35.752]  I'm good.
[02:25:06.425 --> 02:25:07.987]  He's in the Obama deception.
[02:25:08.007 --> 02:25:09.468]  He's Gerald Cilente.
[02:25:11.750 --> 02:25:14.713]  Be sure and check out his website, TrendsResearch.com.
[02:25:14.813 --> 02:25:16.114]  One more, TrendsResearch.com.
[02:25:16.374 --> 02:25:18.556]  Big fat link up on InfoWars.com.
[02:25:18.596 --> 02:25:21.379]  If you forget the URL, I suggest you subscribe to it.
[02:25:21.980 --> 02:25:24.182]  Okay, let's start over there because we got cut in by the break.
[02:25:25.404 --> 02:25:30.766]  Garofalo, she knows, as snot knows as she is, and I've actually used that term myself, but it's a good term for them.
[02:25:31.446 --> 02:25:32.206]  They know, though.
[02:25:32.326 --> 02:25:34.187]  They think they're these big smart geniuses.
[02:25:35.067 --> 02:25:35.707]  They're desperate.
[02:25:35.727 --> 02:25:36.688]  They know they're parasites.
[02:25:36.708 --> 02:25:37.588]  They're not really liberals.
[02:25:37.668 --> 02:25:38.548]  It's like Margaret Sanger.
[02:25:38.928 --> 02:25:42.029]  All her private papers, how much she hated blacks and wanted to kill them, all of it.
[02:25:42.389 --> 02:25:47.231]  She would go around explaining to the blacks how much she loved them as a liberal and, you know, let's just sterilize you or have an abortion.
[02:25:47.841 --> 02:25:48.962]  It's the same thing with these people.
[02:25:49.223 --> 02:26:03.861]  They love to pimp around limousine liberals, you know, like they're helping everybody and they're good, but her and Elberman scientifically know that 98% of the American people, and that's a conservative number, some polls show 99% against the bank or takeover, as you know, Gerald, are together.
[02:26:04.101 --> 02:26:05.383]  So they gotta make this
[02:26:05.763 --> 02:26:09.865]  A left-wing, right-wing issue, and Fox financing trying to take that over.
[02:26:10.125 --> 02:26:14.327]  They're the party out of power, the Republicans, so they can act like they're patriots now.
[02:26:14.687 --> 02:26:16.407]  Rick Perry and all these politicians.
[02:26:16.668 --> 02:26:18.248]  Can you elaborate on that?
[02:26:18.268 --> 02:26:33.394]  I mean, just the cold-blooded treason of this, trying to get the American people fighting with each other, and on national TV, injecting race and racism into things so that black folks, when you see them, you know, at the grocery store, think you're out to get them.
[02:26:33.675 --> 02:26:34.595]  I mean, this is amazing.
[02:26:35.745 --> 02:26:45.170]  Well, again, what they're trying to do, as we see it, with minimizing this tax revolt, is that this has legs.
[02:26:45.470 --> 02:26:50.853]  As I said, we're the folks that saw it coming first and wrote about it, as far as we know.
[02:26:51.393 --> 02:26:55.075]  And we're saying this was a historical event.
[02:26:55.615 --> 02:27:02.519]  So when you have the President, Senior White House Advisor Axelrod, going on to face the nation,
[02:27:03.135 --> 02:27:09.897]  And saying, this country, this is a country where we value liberties and our ability to express ourselves.
[02:27:10.577 --> 02:27:13.118]  And he goes, these expressions are unhealthy.
[02:27:13.138 --> 02:27:15.478]  And then you have that guy Carville.
[02:27:16.919 --> 02:27:22.820]  He calls the Tea Party movements, quote, harmless and damaging to Republicans.
[02:27:23.441 --> 02:27:28.782]  So clearly what they're trying to do is, they know the power of this.
[02:27:29.286 --> 02:27:34.351]  And they're trying to marginalize it by putting people in these categories.
[02:27:34.832 --> 02:27:37.334]  This has nothing to do with ideology.
[02:27:37.615 --> 02:27:40.437]  Are there Libertarians and Republicans out there?
[02:27:40.457 --> 02:27:41.478]  Of course there are.
[02:27:41.779 --> 02:27:47.865]  But there are just angry people that are losing everything, and that's the bigger picture.
[02:27:48.085 --> 02:27:48.906]  And this has meant...
[02:27:50.968 --> 02:27:56.071]  To keep the Democrats from coming out and joining the American people, the Democrats that are... Exactly.
[02:27:56.791 --> 02:27:57.432]  Exactly.
[02:27:57.492 --> 02:28:04.836]  It's keeping the Democrats and other people out from joining them, and they're driving a wedge, and they're doing a good job at it.
[02:28:05.316 --> 02:28:11.680]  But it's only going to be temporary, because when it gets down to the pocketbook issue, then it becomes real.
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:13.721]  Which, by the way, that's the next thing.
[02:28:14.101 --> 02:28:19.584]  And as you well know from our Trends Journal, in the Spring Edition, we wrote a lot about it.
[02:28:20.214 --> 02:28:28.239]  And that this recovery that we're seeing in the stock market, what we called it, was a false flag recovery.
[02:28:28.799 --> 02:28:42.587]  These banks, as you well know, they're now allowed to value their toxic assets at any number that they want to give them, and they're producing fake earning increases.
[02:28:43.286 --> 02:28:46.527]  And it's like you giving me a couple of billion dollars.
[02:28:46.627 --> 02:28:49.448]  I'll report some earnings increases.
[02:28:49.748 --> 02:28:51.028]  Oh, I'll show you profit.
[02:28:51.288 --> 02:28:52.769]  Give me some more billions.
[02:28:53.109 --> 02:28:54.469]  This thing is going down.
[02:28:54.589 --> 02:28:55.910]  It's going to be nonstop.
[02:28:56.310 --> 02:29:00.991]  And the people that don't see what's coming and do not take preventive measures.
[02:29:01.351 --> 02:29:04.552]  And you pointed it out very clearly in the Obama deception.
[02:29:04.832 --> 02:29:08.213]  And if anyone didn't see it yet, they don't know what they're missing.
[02:29:08.673 --> 02:29:11.094]  And people need to know this.
[02:29:11.468 --> 02:29:17.219]  That they better take precautionary measures now because the ship is sinking.
[02:29:17.740 --> 02:29:24.172]  And as you well know also, Alex, they're calling what we're putting out pessimism porn.
[02:29:25.071 --> 02:29:28.232]  You know, and they have this, you know, and they laugh about it.
[02:29:28.412 --> 02:29:31.672]  Oh, you know, Solenti predicted this, he predicted that.
[02:29:31.712 --> 02:29:35.313]  Gerald, Gerald, Gerald, let me stop you, let me stop you there for just a second.
[02:29:35.733 --> 02:29:39.634]  I need you to, your phone's receiver is so good, it's kind of overdriving, so back off the phone a bit.
[02:29:39.674 --> 02:29:40.434]  I'm sorry.
[02:29:40.894 --> 02:29:42.195]  No, no, no, no, it's probably our fault.
[02:29:42.215 --> 02:29:47.396]  But, um, yeah, start over with this pessimism porn, and then that leads into my next question.
[02:29:48.596 --> 02:29:55.102]  We have these MIAC reports that we broke and then the federal reports saying those buying guns are the number one threat to the government and ammo.
[02:29:56.583 --> 02:29:58.825]  Reports that the veterans are the number one threat.
[02:29:59.065 --> 02:30:03.168]  So they built up this anti-terror apparatus, as I've been predicting for years.
[02:30:03.549 --> 02:30:08.933]  They then swung it around overnight and pointed it at the tax protesters, gun owners.
[02:30:09.333 --> 02:30:11.395]  I mean, this is turning into hardcore tyranny.
[02:30:11.415 --> 02:30:14.478]  So can you elaborate on what you were just talking about?
[02:30:15.038 --> 02:30:22.021]  Uh, with them calling us, uh, pessimism porn and then leading into, we're terrorists and need the new domestic CIA to watch us.
[02:30:22.761 --> 02:30:25.923]  Well, the New York Times did an op-ed piece on March 26th.
[02:30:26.283 --> 02:30:29.684]  They called what I'm putting out pessimism porn.
[02:30:30.445 --> 02:30:38.328]  And even though, of course, they cite all the accuracies that we have produced over the nearly 30 years of business.
[02:30:38.969 --> 02:30:40.309]  So they came out with this line.
[02:30:40.329 --> 02:30:44.151]  We're calling what they're putting out optimism opium.
[02:30:44.912 --> 02:30:53.449]  You won't die from porn, but boy, you'll die from this optimism opium because the ship is going down and they've drugged the people.
[02:30:53.914 --> 02:30:58.338]  And then you pointed it out with this left-wing movement and these liberals.
[02:30:58.398 --> 02:31:01.860]  They're drugging the people into believing the lines.
[02:31:02.281 --> 02:31:04.062]  It's optimism opium.
[02:31:04.363 --> 02:31:05.483]  They keep selling it.
[02:31:05.744 --> 02:31:12.009]  And at the same level, by the way, they're always pushing out, you know, the economists say this and the economists say that.
[02:31:12.289 --> 02:31:13.730]  But we need to be confident.
[02:31:13.810 --> 02:31:15.071]  We need to be optimistic.
[02:31:15.391 --> 02:31:15.952]  Wait a minute.
[02:31:16.172 --> 02:31:19.715]  If you're going to stick with economics and use mathematical formulas,
[02:31:20.143 --> 02:31:26.527]  And call it a science, even though it's a pseudoscience, then what does optimism and confidence have with this?
[02:31:26.928 --> 02:31:28.429]  This isn't about pessimism.
[02:31:28.889 --> 02:31:30.450]  The ship has hit an iceberg.
[02:31:30.830 --> 02:31:31.531]  It's sinking.
[02:31:32.131 --> 02:31:38.135]  And you better grab a lifeboat, a lifejacket, or a life raft, because there's not even going to be debris to hang on to.
[02:31:38.395 --> 02:31:40.096]  This thing's going down quickly.
[02:31:40.497 --> 02:31:48.182]  And they're cozying the people into thinking that this is going to be saved by a song and dance man out there.
[02:31:48.550 --> 02:31:52.274]  That's going to bring the country into a new age.
[02:31:52.374 --> 02:31:53.255]  It's not happening.
[02:32:04.147 --> 02:32:32.441]  You know, the deck to try to float on, and they're telling us we're not even on a ship, and we're not even on the North Atlantic, and then meanwhile, they're now saying people that don't like the banks are terrorists, and we found out when we were protesting the Fed that's in the Obama deception, we got the secret document, now it's mainstream news, the Army was watching us, and the Army document that got leaked to us, and then we put it out, and now the news confirmed it, says, look out military, don't let them know you're military spying on them, they're terrorists and may kill you.
[02:32:33.061 --> 02:32:35.843]  I mean, this is entering cuckoo land level.
[02:32:35.863 --> 02:32:37.664]  Well, it's not entering cuckoo land.
[02:32:37.704 --> 02:32:39.485]  What it's entering is fascism.
[02:32:40.206 --> 02:32:49.692]  And that's what this is, the merger of corporate and state powers, according to Mussolini, who knew a thing or two about fascism.
[02:32:50.052 --> 02:32:51.333]  That's what he called it.
[02:32:51.914 --> 02:32:53.615]  And that's what's going on now.
[02:32:54.515 --> 02:32:58.078]  And this is just the... Now, first, it's the economic fascism.
[02:32:58.538 --> 02:33:01.300]  Secondly, it's going to be the political fascism.
[02:33:01.852 --> 02:33:08.697]  America's turning into a fascist state, and I'm not a right-winger, I'm not a left-winger, I'm a political atheist.
[02:33:08.978 --> 02:33:11.740]  I call a spade a spade, I have no trouble with that.
[02:33:12.340 --> 02:33:23.609]  And when you look again at the definition by Mussolini, the merger of corporate and state powers is called fascism.
[02:33:24.136 --> 02:33:34.370]  So what you're talking about with the intelligence and the wiretapping and calling us extremists, that's the next level.
[02:33:34.690 --> 02:33:40.158]  That's to put down the revolt and the revulsion of what's going on.
[02:33:41.277 --> 02:33:51.965]  But we're obviously on the right saying we shouldn't have offshore banks hijacking the government, bipartisanly, and stealing $12.8 trillion, the GDP, in six months.
[02:33:52.065 --> 02:33:55.128]  And that's in late April 2009.
[02:33:56.148 --> 02:33:57.369]  God knows what it'll be soon.
[02:33:57.389 --> 02:34:00.832]  They're saying it's on line to be $26 trillion by the end of the year.
[02:34:01.432 --> 02:34:03.474]  That'll be double the GDP.
[02:34:03.994 --> 02:34:06.296]  I mean, this is just open crime.
[02:34:06.796 --> 02:34:09.719]  And I guess, then, Gerald, you're saying they're going for broken.
[02:34:10.659 --> 02:34:19.085]  They're, I mean, because now they're announcing White House officials says we'll bail out the newspapers and TV, but then the government will own it and tell them what to say.
[02:34:19.105 --> 02:34:19.665]  That's L.A.
[02:34:19.705 --> 02:34:20.106]  Times.
[02:34:20.486 --> 02:34:30.012]  And then we have them firing the head of GM and telling them what to do and telling the head of Dodge, you will let Fiat, the Bilderberg Group owned thing, take you over.
[02:34:30.052 --> 02:34:31.693]  I mean, it really is fascism.
[02:34:32.374 --> 02:34:34.475]  Again, you know, Americans are drugged.
[02:34:34.495 --> 02:34:36.797]  We're the most medicated country in the world.
[02:34:37.361 --> 02:34:48.550]  And now we're drugged on this optimism opium that we have the showmen in chief singing and dancing it out there, you know, putting on all these stage shows.
[02:34:49.211 --> 02:34:50.752]  So they're drugged.
[02:34:50.812 --> 02:34:53.715]  The people are drugged in more ways than one.
[02:34:54.818 --> 02:35:12.844]  And now you know that, I mean, you go out, you see people, they're twittering, they're text messaging, they're out of their minds, they're not watching what's going on, and when you have that kind of situation, Alex, you could push everything over on them.
[02:35:13.064 --> 02:35:13.385]  It's a spell.
[02:35:13.425 --> 02:35:14.825]  And that's what's going on right now.
[02:35:15.025 --> 02:35:17.146]  It's a spell, it's like they've been hypnotized.
[02:35:17.751 --> 02:35:17.991]  Right.
[02:35:18.452 --> 02:35:20.954]  Again, it's Optimism Opium.
[02:35:21.114 --> 02:35:22.595]  They sell it every day.
[02:35:22.975 --> 02:35:26.798]  Can't you say something positive?
[02:35:27.199 --> 02:35:36.987]  I mean, look at the last words of the guy who did the Good Morning America interview with me.
[02:35:37.007 --> 02:35:41.610]  He said something like, oh, you know, you're not a happy guy or something like that.
[02:35:41.691 --> 02:35:43.372]  You know, some silly thing.
[02:35:43.392 --> 02:35:44.493]  He was a nice enough guy.
[02:35:45.276 --> 02:35:55.159]  And by the way, I have to tell you, Fox has been very good with me, and I've gotten to know a number of the people on the Fox Happy Hour, and I can't say enough good things about them.
[02:35:55.539 --> 02:36:01.441]  And they're not the people that I talk to on the set, and I've been on that show quite a bit.
[02:36:01.801 --> 02:36:03.322]  I have to tell you, they're not...
[02:36:03.717 --> 02:36:05.098]  They're not taking stands.
[02:36:05.158 --> 02:36:07.859]  They're not Republican or Democrat, right or left.
[02:36:08.259 --> 02:36:09.760]  You know, they're fed up with this stuff.
[02:36:09.780 --> 02:36:10.921]  Well, let me tell you, let me tell you.
[02:36:11.341 --> 02:36:15.263]  I've talked over the years to a lot of Fox producers, and they're listeners of the show.
[02:36:15.303 --> 02:36:16.404]  They know about the New World Order.
[02:36:16.924 --> 02:36:18.425]  They can't stand what they're doing.
[02:36:19.485 --> 02:36:21.867]  Uh... and also Murdoch is smart.
[02:36:21.967 --> 02:36:23.849]  He will brand whatever country he's in.
[02:36:23.909 --> 02:36:25.671]  He'll go with what the prevailing attitude is.
[02:36:26.231 --> 02:36:34.718]  And so right now he knows, like you've said, this is the trend, patriotism, liberty, getting back to 1776 instead of to 1984 culture.
[02:36:35.219 --> 02:36:38.481]  They know that this is the rising tide.
[02:36:38.561 --> 02:36:41.063]  And so, yes, they want to be popular.
[02:36:42.364 --> 02:36:44.766]  Now the MSNBCs and others, they're trying to
[02:36:45.447 --> 02:36:50.233]  Go along with the optimism opium that you were trying to talk about right there.
[02:36:50.293 --> 02:36:55.920]  Now, Gerald, what do you see on the front of trying to restrict free speech?
[02:36:57.947 --> 02:37:10.075]  They're now announcing, Senator Jay Rockefeller has said, hey, we'd be better off without an internet, we need to have a new internet too, we don't have any of these freedoms, where we control what you can do, where sites are restricted.
[02:37:11.536 --> 02:37:19.381]  All over the West, from Australia to Canada, they're announcing Chinese-style net censorship, that's a headline, but saying it's good.
[02:37:19.941 --> 02:37:21.902]  How do you see them going after the internet?
[02:37:22.383 --> 02:37:23.784]  They're going to go after everything.
[02:37:23.804 --> 02:37:27.226]  They're going to try to take as many of our rights away as possible.
[02:37:27.699 --> 02:37:33.323]  And Obama's going to be able to do it even better than Bush, because he has brought support.
[02:37:33.823 --> 02:37:44.671]  And they also may try a false flag incident, that they're going to say we have to, you know, because of this incident, we have to restrict your rights, just like they pushed through the Patriot Act.
[02:37:45.371 --> 02:37:54.098]  And of course, we also know that Obama as well voted to reinstate the Patriot Act, and is bringing it to new levels as well.
[02:37:54.678 --> 02:37:57.220]  So we see more and more restrictions,
[02:37:57.665 --> 02:38:02.537]  And there's going to be more and more of a clampdown, and net neutrality is going to be a huge issue.
[02:38:06.820 --> 02:38:10.441]  The media tried to spin it, except for Agency French Press and a few others.
[02:38:10.861 --> 02:38:13.762]  The media tried to spin that he had rebuked torture.
[02:38:14.042 --> 02:38:20.644]  But when you read the orders and the statements, he says, we've got to protect our professionals that did the torture and followed orders.
[02:38:20.984 --> 02:38:28.226]  So what he really did in precedent was overthrow what was decided at Nuremberg, that just following orders doesn't cut it.
[02:38:28.526 --> 02:38:35.968]  He now says, no, you're going to be protected in government if you follow orders to commit brutal crimes, including torturing children with insects.
[02:38:37.133 --> 02:38:37.954]  Yeah, I know.
[02:38:39.675 --> 02:38:42.138]  Again, this is where the country is heading.
[02:38:42.798 --> 02:38:45.941]  And people better, as I said, they better wake up quickly.
[02:38:46.642 --> 02:38:52.908]  Not only are we going to lose our rights, but before you know it, you're going to lose all your money, too.
[02:38:53.488 --> 02:38:57.692]  Because they're also talking about this new reserve currency.
[02:38:58.473 --> 02:39:02.577]  We see with China, they're not dumping dollars, they're buying up assets.
[02:39:03.157 --> 02:39:19.535]  We still believe the dollar is going to dive hyperinflation, and we're still very bullish on gold, and it's very important now that people again take proactive measures in anticipation of what's to come.
[02:39:19.815 --> 02:39:23.239]  We're already seeing the breaks again now in the stock market.
[02:39:23.652 --> 02:39:26.354]  Today the market's down well over 200 points.
[02:39:26.834 --> 02:39:29.916]  Banks are now again reporting weak earnings.
[02:39:30.517 --> 02:39:32.458]  It's just the beginning.
[02:39:32.778 --> 02:39:34.319]  There's no way out.
[02:39:54.172 --> 02:39:58.935]  Well, what they're doing is, as you well know, for example, let's take it with unemployment.
[02:40:00.056 --> 02:40:04.818]  There's the official unemployment number, and then there's the total unemployment number.
[02:40:04.858 --> 02:40:12.362]  When you look at total unemployment, according to some statisticians at the University of Maryland, it's at 17%.
[02:40:12.883 --> 02:40:22.548]  These include people that no longer are looking for work because they've given up, they can't find jobs, they're off the unemployment rolls, and people that are working
[02:40:23.175 --> 02:40:25.817]  Part-time, and they want full-time work.
[02:40:26.177 --> 02:40:31.501]  We're going to see unemployment rolls hitting unemployment, real unemployment, at about 25%.
[02:40:31.601 --> 02:40:36.225]  They're going to keep spinning the data as much as they can.
[02:40:36.585 --> 02:40:37.746]  They do it all the time.
[02:40:37.786 --> 02:40:43.430]  They come out with numbers, and then they adjust them after a month later, and they're much worse than they are.
[02:40:43.710 --> 02:40:45.511]  And then that way... Go ahead.
[02:40:46.052 --> 02:40:48.734]  We also have to look at what's going on globally.
[02:40:49.634 --> 02:40:52.076]  We're seeing coming out of Japan, for example,
[02:40:52.900 --> 02:40:58.442]  Last month, February's numbers, exports were off 49%.
[02:40:59.602 --> 02:41:02.803]  Taiwan, exports are off 42%.
[02:41:02.963 --> 02:41:10.186]  The Eastern European, what used to be called the Eastern European bloc, they're underwater.
[02:41:10.506 --> 02:41:14.447]  Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Romania, they're gone.
[02:41:14.947 --> 02:41:18.008]  You saw riots in Iceland, that was just the beginning.
[02:41:18.568 --> 02:41:20.409]  Spain, Ireland.
[02:41:20.896 --> 02:41:26.580]  You name the country, the UK, we're going into the greatest depression.
[02:41:27.060 --> 02:41:30.202]  This is no joke, it's not pessimism porn.
[02:41:30.703 --> 02:41:41.069]  The people that believe the opposite again, they're taking the drug, they're drinking the Kool-Aid, their brains are washed, and they're dying from optimism opium.
[02:41:41.350 --> 02:41:43.071]  They better take measures now.
[02:41:43.391 --> 02:41:44.512]  That was my next question.
[02:41:45.646 --> 02:41:46.966]  They announced this G20.
[02:41:47.026 --> 02:41:48.227]  They've engineered the crisis.
[02:41:48.287 --> 02:41:51.968]  Now the very banks that engineered it say, we're setting up a bank of the world.
[02:41:52.368 --> 02:41:54.869]  You're going to pay carbon taxes to us.
[02:41:55.629 --> 02:41:59.551]  They're going to cut the carbon in the U.S., but not in China and India.
[02:41:59.811 --> 02:42:01.451]  That'll further destroy our economy.
[02:42:03.212 --> 02:42:05.513]  They don't care about our economy.
[02:42:06.053 --> 02:42:07.713]  It's about bottom line.
[02:42:08.333 --> 02:42:09.834]  We know that from the top.
[02:42:10.555 --> 02:42:20.860]  And that's why the discrepancy between the average worker and the CEO, depending on whose numbers you look at, could range as high as 500 to 1.
[02:42:21.340 --> 02:42:27.843]  When I was a young man getting into the workforce in the late 1960s, it was 20 to 1.
[02:42:28.503 --> 02:42:32.425]  That's the only thing they're interested in, is bottom line profit.
[02:42:32.905 --> 02:42:35.326]  You're going to start seeing some major failures.
[02:42:35.787 --> 02:42:38.808]  Remember the commercial real estate collapse I was talking about?
[02:42:39.408 --> 02:42:40.549]  It's starting to happen.
[02:42:40.729 --> 02:42:43.750]  Let's talk about that in the final segment with Gerald Cilente.
[02:42:44.111 --> 02:42:46.092]  FriendsResearch.com is the website.
[02:42:46.132 --> 02:42:47.252]  Put it up on screen for folks.
[02:42:47.632 --> 02:42:49.893]  There in the bright watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:42:50.234 --> 02:42:52.335]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:42:59.565 --> 02:43:04.909]  With an economy that continues to plummet, many of us will have to make the difficult decision to cut back on our expenses.
[02:43:05.530 --> 02:43:08.192]  One thing we cannot afford to cut back on, though, is our health.
[02:43:08.653 --> 02:43:15.939]  If you suffer from chronic illness, stress, a weak immune system, or just always feel tired, you need to visit Shentrition.com.
[02:43:16.419 --> 02:43:20.943]  The philosophy at Shentrition is to feed the body what it needs, plus heal the body with food.
[02:43:21.603 --> 02:43:22.064]  We're good.
[02:43:36.832 --> 02:43:40.175]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:44:05.897 --> 02:44:11.241]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:44:11.761 --> 02:44:17.965]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:44:18.265 --> 02:44:20.086]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:44:20.226 --> 02:44:22.628]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:44:22.708 --> 02:44:33.595]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:44:35.885 --> 02:44:37.125]  It's not about left or right.
[02:44:37.545 --> 02:44:38.926]  It's about a one world government.
[02:44:39.406 --> 02:44:45.708]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:44:54.570 --> 02:44:55.730]  The Obama Deception.
[02:44:56.131 --> 02:44:57.351]  The people strike back.
[02:44:58.945 --> 02:45:04.431]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[02:45:04.931 --> 02:45:05.632]  Think about that.
[02:45:05.672 --> 02:45:08.334]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[02:45:08.815 --> 02:45:11.738]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[02:45:12.018 --> 02:45:21.808]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious tasting, chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants.
[02:45:22.248 --> 02:45:22.548]  I think?

[02:46:10.542 --> 02:46:12.883]  It's sundown on the Union.
[02:46:13.203 --> 02:46:22.605]  And they're now trying to make home gardens in places like Tulsa, Oklahoma illegal.
[02:46:22.785 --> 02:46:25.186]  It is happening.
[02:46:25.206 --> 02:46:29.547]  This government is totally tyrannical.
[02:46:29.747 --> 02:46:31.847]  I want to get into home.
[02:46:34.750 --> 02:46:39.994]  Well we're asking for an intellectual revolution and that's the only thing that we can see changing this in the terms that
[02:47:04.386 --> 02:47:06.146]  The systems are totally corrupt.
[02:47:06.446 --> 02:47:08.587]  We have a two-headed, one-party system.
[02:47:09.307 --> 02:47:13.828]  Our financial institutions, Wall Street, it's a criminal gang.
[02:47:13.908 --> 02:47:15.308]  I mean, it's a D.C.
[02:47:15.368 --> 02:47:16.088]  heist.
[02:47:16.148 --> 02:47:18.009]  Wall Street's taken over Washington.
[02:47:18.529 --> 02:47:22.710]  And the media's monopolizing our minds with this moron talk.
[02:47:23.090 --> 02:47:24.310]  They have these buffoons.
[02:47:24.350 --> 02:47:32.052]  You know, when I talked about, you know, Fox, I'm not talking about, you know, people like Hannity or O'Reilly.
[02:47:32.092 --> 02:47:33.592]  I mean, to me, these guys are
[02:47:34.045 --> 02:47:37.387]  You know, there's nothing about them that I would support.
[02:47:37.407 --> 02:47:39.529]  I want to make that really clear.
[02:47:39.589 --> 02:47:45.232]  I was talking about just the group of people I know on Happy Hour and a few others.
[02:47:46.833 --> 02:47:51.096]  So we have to stop this mind poison that they keep killing us with.
[02:47:51.657 --> 02:47:59.442]  And people, my father may have saw Rest in Peace, used to say to me when I would repeat anything that everybody else was saying, he'd say to me in Italian,
[02:48:02.082 --> 02:48:05.343]  Stop repeating what everybody else is saying and think for yourself.
[02:48:06.163 --> 02:48:09.064]  And this is a time when people need to think for themselves.
[02:48:09.664 --> 02:48:26.988]  The only way that we can get out of this is by coming up with intelligent decisions rather than having the president go out on comedy shows and put out these spin and throwing out these one-line sound bites and making decisions based on that.
[02:48:27.328 --> 02:48:29.889]  And the other president, you know, he didn't go on comedy shows
[02:48:30.325 --> 02:48:32.906]  But he had this whole soundbite thing down as well.
[02:48:33.426 --> 02:48:36.147]  This is very, we're at a critical time in our nation.
[02:48:36.547 --> 02:48:47.311]  And either the nation is going to go under in fascism and control, or we could emerge as a better nation in terms of looking toward the future in a more positive way.
[02:48:47.771 --> 02:48:57.695]  And in saying that, by the way, one of the things, as you know, we have said is that the only thing that could get us out of the financial crisis is a productive capacity.
[02:48:58.812 --> 02:49:06.920]  You're hearing now more and more again about coal fusion, which a lot of people believe that was suppressed by the big energy companies.
[02:49:07.541 --> 02:49:14.207]  And there's going to be an alternative energy, and people should start looking in those directions for opportunities as well.
[02:49:14.868 --> 02:49:22.055]  So, in talking about an intellectual revolution, these are the kind of things that we're talking about.
[02:49:23.390 --> 02:49:26.092]  Well, I don't see how the tyrants are going to get away with what they're doing.
[02:49:26.172 --> 02:49:30.275]  In closing, as I interrupted you with a break, real fast, how bad is real estate going to get?
[02:49:30.315 --> 02:49:33.317]  Because, I mean, it's now coming out that it's just totally screwed as well.
[02:49:33.458 --> 02:49:33.998]  It is.
[02:49:34.158 --> 02:49:40.583]  And now you're going to start seeing, as we've been saying, the next shoe that's going to be falling is going to be the commercial real estate sector.
[02:49:40.863 --> 02:49:44.326]  We just saw the second largest mall developer go bankrupt.
[02:49:44.706 --> 02:49:45.667]  General Growth.
[02:49:46.007 --> 02:49:46.427]  I love it.
[02:49:46.647 --> 02:49:48.409]  Bad year for generals, isn't it?
[02:49:48.749 --> 02:49:50.770]  General Motors, General Growth.
[02:49:51.231 --> 02:49:52.752]  How about General Malaise?
[02:49:53.328 --> 02:49:54.449]  This thing is over.
[02:49:54.509 --> 02:49:55.689]  They've over-expanded.
[02:49:55.709 --> 02:49:56.630]  They've over-built.
[02:49:56.890 --> 02:49:59.992]  You're going to see ghost malls popping up all over the country.
[02:50:00.312 --> 02:50:03.694]  This is no time to invest now in real estate.
[02:50:14.909 --> 02:50:15.590]  Thank you, God bless.
[02:50:15.610 --> 02:50:17.531]  There goes Gerald Cilente, amazing individual.
[02:50:17.891 --> 02:50:22.875]  By the way, I had a bunch of sponsors I was supposed to plug and I didn't, so let me just briefly tell you who made this show possible.
[02:50:23.235 --> 02:50:24.977]  HomeGain, HomeGain.com.
[02:50:25.797 --> 02:50:26.478]  Check them out.
[02:50:26.898 --> 02:50:29.100]  EFoodsDirect, EFoodsDirect.com.
[02:50:29.540 --> 02:50:31.822]  And Pepperspray.com, Pepperspray.com.
[02:50:32.482 --> 02:50:34.143]  Just great folks, those sponsors.
[02:50:34.164 --> 02:50:35.004]  I'm going to plug them tomorrow.
[02:50:35.264 --> 02:50:35.865]  God bless you.
[02:50:35.885 --> 02:50:38.747]  Retransmission with tons of key info in the first hour starts now.
[02:50:39.047 --> 02:50:39.648]  InfoWars.com.
[02:50:41.536 --> 02:50:42.556]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:50:42.577 --> 02:50:44.657]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:50:44.697 --> 02:50:47.179]  Genesis Communications Radio Network, baby!
[02:50:47.199 --> 02:50:49.220]  Uh, again, return to where it starts now.
[02:50:49.240 --> 02:50:49.820]  Hello, friends.
[02:50:49.860 --> 02:50:50.800]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:50:50.920 --> 02:50:55.522]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:50:55.662 --> 02:50:58.424]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:50:58.624 --> 02:51:01.485]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:51:01.665 --> 02:51:07.508]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:51:07.748 --> 02:51:10.691]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:51:10.992 --> 02:51:17.899]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:51:17.979 --> 02:51:21.122]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:51:21.263 --> 02:51:21.463]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:51:21.523 --> 02:51:22.924]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.

[02:51:39.599 --> 02:51:43.863]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:51:44.023 --> 02:51:44.984]  Take action today.
[02:51:45.164 --> 02:51:46.926]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:51:52.070 --> 02:51:56.664]  You're listening to GCN, the world leader in independent talk radio.
[02:52:03.192 --> 02:52:05.774]  IRN USA Radio News, I'm Hope Duggar.
[02:52:05.934 --> 02:52:10.518]  President Obama met with his full cabinet and then traveled to CIA headquarters for a briefing.
[02:52:10.818 --> 02:52:12.239]  Here's correspondent Connie Laun.
[02:52:12.359 --> 02:52:18.284]  President Obama instructed his cabinet members to cut out $100 million from their agencies.
[02:52:18.584 --> 02:52:21.246]  That is only a drop in the bucket of his over $3.5 trillion budget.
[02:52:23.206 --> 02:52:27.930]  The budget has increased programs for health care, energy, defense, and education.
