[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:06.116]  Number 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[00:00:07.698 --> 00:00:09.920]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:13.284]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.593 --> 00:00:19.076]  It is the ninth day of February 2009.
[00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:25.584]  For the next 51 minutes, we are joined by Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:32.813]  Every book he's written that I know of has been a New York Times bestseller, many of them number one New York Times bestseller, like the late, great USA.
[00:00:34.893 --> 00:00:44.720]  And that book, by the way, covers all the secret documents that he and others had to sue to get, of how they were covertly setting up a North American Union, how they planned to implode the economy by design.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:56.908]  Now the Wall Street Journal, now the New York Times, they're all saying, yes, world government's the answer, yes, the New World Order's real, yes, NORTHCOM's running everything.
[00:00:57.248 --> 00:01:02.372]  The whole police state that Bush set up, and he was just a puppet, is now being expanded by Obama.
[00:01:03.388 --> 00:01:05.531]  And Dr. Corsi came out and exposed Bush for that.
[00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:10.556]  He was called a right-wing pundit because he was the guy that wrote the Swift Boat book that was accurate on Kerry.
[00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:14.721]  His book on Obama, they did a national hoax and said it wasn't accurate.
[00:01:15.222 --> 00:01:15.842]  I read the book.
[00:01:16.323 --> 00:01:19.086]  I've been doing research on Obama now intensely for eight months.
[00:01:19.486 --> 00:01:20.167]  It's worse
[00:01:20.968 --> 00:01:23.049]  Than what Dr. Corsi said in that book.
[00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.871]  So they basically tried to discredit him there, but now the proof is in the pudding.
[00:01:28.212 --> 00:01:29.932]  Obama's gone back on every promise.
[00:01:30.073 --> 00:01:33.994]  Obama... It is worse than I even thought it could have possibly been.
[00:01:34.635 --> 00:01:36.716]  So, but before we get into Obama with Dr. Corsi...
[00:01:37.922 --> 00:01:41.963]  You know, he's got a financial background degree from Harvard in this.
[00:01:41.983 --> 00:01:44.664]  I want to get into the economy, what's currently happening with the New World Order.
[00:01:45.064 --> 00:01:50.085]  What is it like to be proven totally right to have FBI training manuals say you're a terrorist?
[00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:51.705]  If you talk about a New World Order, it doesn't exist.
[00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:54.326]  Now it's in the Financial Times of London Newsweek.
[00:01:54.586 --> 00:01:56.827]  A global bank will pay carbon taxes too.
[00:01:56.927 --> 00:01:57.147]  I mean,
[00:01:57.967 --> 00:02:03.511]  It's all happening now to write a book that was nationally demonized and attacked and they said wasn't real.
[00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:05.512]  And now everything in the book has come true.
[00:02:05.572 --> 00:02:07.594]  By the way, we have it available at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:07.854 --> 00:02:09.635]  The Late Great USA, very well done.
[00:02:09.655 --> 00:02:10.636]  New York Times bestseller.
[00:02:11.156 --> 00:02:13.958]  He, of course, wrote Obama Nation, a number one New York Times bestseller.
[00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.261]  And he is Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:19.262]  Dr. Corsi, good to have you back with us.
[00:02:20.263 --> 00:02:21.784]  Hi Alex, it's great to be with you.
[00:02:21.864 --> 00:02:25.867]  I apologize for the cell phone, but I'm driving into New York City right now.
[00:02:26.562 --> 00:02:27.984]  I didn't double check with my producer.
[00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:29.265]  How long do we have you?
[00:02:45.353 --> 00:02:48.915]  Well, we'll go as long as we can, but we'll certainly get a half an hour, maybe a little bit more.
[00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:50.215]  Yeah, let's go to about 40 after.
[00:02:50.255 --> 00:02:51.456]  Okay, let's move quick then.
[00:02:52.396 --> 00:02:59.279]  Vindicated in spades, Dr. Jerome Corsi, let's get into the economy first, and why are they openly announcing world government?
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.000]  Well, you know, it's amazing.
[00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:02.881]  You're right, Alex.
[00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:11.865]  You know, when I wrote The Late Great USA, and it was published in 2007, it was roundly, everybody said, oh, there's no plan for North American Union.
[00:03:12.642 --> 00:03:16.563]  But today, I think now we've even got some of the major think tanks.
[00:03:16.583 --> 00:03:18.423]  You know, you've got the Hudson Institute out.
[00:03:18.863 --> 00:03:23.584]  You've got others saying, yes, there was a plan to create North American integration.
[00:03:24.124 --> 00:03:28.205]  And in fact, it was slowed down by the fact that we exposed it.
[00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:31.225]  Simon & Schuster just published a paperback.
[00:03:31.285 --> 00:03:32.246]  It'll be out in a week.
[00:03:32.666 --> 00:03:34.066]  We have to get you some copies, though.
[00:03:34.106 --> 00:03:35.266]  They're available on your site.
[00:03:35.726 --> 00:03:36.786]  Of the late, great USA.
[00:03:36.826 --> 00:03:38.367]  And I wrote a new epilogue to it.
[00:03:38.967 --> 00:03:39.407]  And the key
[00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:53.396]  The thesis of the epilogue is that exposure, like you do on your show, the light of day, is the one thing that the global elite pushing for integration of economies and integration of government can't stand.
[00:03:54.117 --> 00:04:05.767]  And when the people realize, you know, some of these economic crises have been created or certainly are manipulated to say we need more free trade, you know, more
[00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:07.098]  I think so.
[00:04:24.286 --> 00:04:25.166]  Well, that's right.
[00:04:25.206 --> 00:04:27.787]  What happens, Alex, is they get a public relations makeover.
[00:04:27.807 --> 00:04:29.827]  So, the Trans-Texas Corridor is an excellent article.
[00:04:53.078 --> 00:04:53.918]  An excellent example.
[00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.459]  I wrote about that in World Death Daily.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.922]  Governor Perry says, no, the Trans-Texas Corridor project is dead.
[00:05:01.662 --> 00:05:13.088]  They say, well, what about the agreement you signed with Sintra in Spain to build this Trans-Texas Corridor 35, you know, four football fields, wide highway, parallel to Interstate 35.
[00:05:13.488 --> 00:05:15.229]  And Perry says, well, we'll go ahead with that.
[00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:17.670]  It's just going to be under a different name.
[00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.332]  So you've got to be very careful to see that, and what he canceled
[00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:29.134]  The full 4,000 miles of the Trans-Texas Corridor, that wasn't going to go in for over a 50 year period of time.
[00:05:29.714 --> 00:05:31.996]  They didn't need to have that there.
[00:05:32.036 --> 00:05:33.557]  It's again incrementalism.
[00:05:33.937 --> 00:05:36.418]  Well let me tell you what's in the Texas papers.
[00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:40.981]  They admit all the major projects they already had slated, they're still building them all.
[00:05:41.001 --> 00:05:44.423]  They're just not calling it Trans-Texas Corridor and they're taking the billboards down.
[00:05:45.324 --> 00:05:47.045]  Well that's the whole point.
[00:05:47.565 --> 00:05:50.247]  And if we keep exposing that,
[00:05:50.856 --> 00:05:53.458]  I keep making it clear that the agenda is continuing.
[00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:58.962]  You know, people hear, oh, Trans-Pacific Corridor is cancelled, and they relax.
[00:05:59.002 --> 00:06:00.223]  They think we've won a victory.
[00:06:00.724 --> 00:06:02.065]  But it's just public relation.
[00:06:02.845 --> 00:06:04.687]  It's the same thing Obama's doing right now.
[00:06:04.747 --> 00:06:08.490]  I wrote an article in my newsletter, my economic newsletter, Red Alert.
[00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:17.357]  Now, redalert.wnd.com, this economic stimulus package that Obama's going around now and holding town hall meetings.
[00:06:17.437 --> 00:06:20.099]  He was just in Indiana today with the first.
[00:06:20.953 --> 00:06:32.138]  They've had public relations advisors, focus groups, so they say, well, we'll call it economic stimulus, because that's going to be more received than if we call it economic recovery.
[00:06:32.678 --> 00:06:40.162]  We're getting managed by repackaging these ideas so the people will accept them without really knowing what's in them.
[00:06:42.466 --> 00:07:01.832]  Well, I want to get into Obama with you for the main part of the interview, but specifically, I'm sure you've seen the hundreds of articles in Newsweek, Financial Times of London, last week or a week and a half ago in Market Watch, the Wall Street Journal, saying, yeah, we're setting up a world government, yeah, we kept it secret from you for your own good, yeah,
[00:07:02.432 --> 00:07:10.236]  It's going to be dictatorial, but that's the only thing that will fix the economic crisis when it's the very same banking cartels that engineered the crisis.
[00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:14.158]  Can you speak... Why are they admitting so much in the New World Order now?
[00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:17.719]  Well, I think they're getting... they feel they're closer to getting it in place.
[00:07:17.799 --> 00:07:19.140]  I mean, take a look.
[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.662]  I read about Klaus Schwab, who's the head of the Davos Economic Forum.
[00:07:23.702 --> 00:07:24.443]  He created it.
[00:07:25.323 --> 00:07:26.964]  And he did an interview with CNBC.
[00:07:27.044 --> 00:07:30.465]  He said, we're in a transformational crisis.
[00:07:31.186 --> 00:07:31.666]  In other words,
[00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:40.856]  The plan that Schwab and the Davos Economic Council has is, let's use this global economic crisis to have the solution be more globalism.
[00:07:41.556 --> 00:07:44.899]  Henry Kissinger wrote an article saying the same thing.
[00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:52.544]  He said that Obama needs to now openly push for global governance, because there's a global economic crisis.
[00:07:53.104 --> 00:07:58.048]  They're openly saying it's time for global structures, economics and politics, to be put in place.
[00:08:02.662 --> 00:08:05.043]  Well, you know, just take a look at some of the other issues.
[00:08:05.103 --> 00:08:20.870]  I mean, there are, I counted now, nine members of the Trilateral Commission that are working in the Obama Administration, including, you know, Susan Rice, the Ambassador to the U.N., Gaithner, Timothy Gaithner, who is the Secretary of Treasury.
[00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:24.172]  You know, Obama said we uniquely need Gaithner.
[00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:27.734]  He's the only guy who can solve the problem, even though he didn't pay his income taxes.
[00:08:28.494 --> 00:08:29.835]  And I looked at Gaithner's record.
[00:08:31.027 --> 00:08:38.211]  was head of the Federal Reserve in New York, and he presided over some of the worst economic failures we've ever had.
[00:08:38.911 --> 00:08:44.754]  Citibank going broke and needing a cash infusion, Bear Stearns collapsing, Lehman Brothers collapsing.
[00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:52.738]  I mean, how do these failures qualify a guy like Gaithner to be the only guy qualified to solve the problem?
[00:08:52.758 --> 00:08:57.360]  Well, Gaithner is counsel on foreign relations, Gaithner is trilateral commission,
[00:08:58.018 --> 00:09:02.999]  Gaepler is going to push this good bank, bad bank scenario, which is a global solution.
[00:09:03.039 --> 00:09:08.601]  That's the Swedish model that was used in Sweden largely to nationalize the banks.
[00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:19.144]  And Gaepler is going to be proposing that either later this week or next week when he, you know, essentially is using a global model to nationalize US banks.
[00:09:19.224 --> 00:09:21.104]  That's what good bank, bad bank is all about.
[00:09:21.624 --> 00:09:23.325]  Well, it came out during the
[00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:31.246]  Reports that were in the media for Bretton Woods 2 a few months ago that they're going to create a new global bank.
[00:09:31.266 --> 00:09:33.088]  Listen, this was in Newsweek with the headline.
[00:09:33.728 --> 00:09:41.915]  A new global world bank that sets interest rates, sets the values of currencies, and that we pay our carbon taxes to to fund it.
[00:09:42.555 --> 00:09:47.439]  And so literally, and also global banking regulations, so through fines and fees,
[00:09:48.476 --> 00:09:56.219]  The private banks will create a world government as a solution to the crisis that they created.
[00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:59.000]  And so this is the birth of the real New World Order.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:09:59.741]  Can you speak to that?
[00:10:00.581 --> 00:10:01.161]  Well, yes, it is.
[00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:08.304]  I mean, I saw today, I've been reading some of the internal reports on the economic plan of the Obama administration.
[00:10:08.324 --> 00:10:13.606]  One of the plans is going to be to make the Federal Reserve a government bank.
[00:10:14.346 --> 00:10:15.767]  Not everybody should know the private,
[00:10:16.448 --> 00:10:17.889]  The Federal Reserve is a private bank.
[00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:24.252]  It's currently no more federal government than Federal Express is a government package service.
[00:10:24.313 --> 00:10:25.273]  It's a private bank.
[00:10:26.074 --> 00:10:39.001]  But once they make it a public bank, then you've got the beginnings of a central bank in the United States that's owned by the government that could be integrated with the European Central Bank or transformed into a North American Central Bank.
[00:10:39.744 --> 00:10:42.973]  And that's going to be a major step the Obama administration is going to go for.
[00:10:43.274 --> 00:10:45.039]  But sir... Sir, stop!
[00:10:45.059 --> 00:10:46.944]  Because they want to say they're solving a crisis.
[00:10:47.278 --> 00:10:47.838]  All right, stay there.
[00:10:47.978 --> 00:10:49.739]  I mean, repeat that because I interrupted, but here's the key.
[00:10:50.159 --> 00:11:01.665]  They say they're creating the Bank of the United States and the Federal Reserve will now be governmental, but that's another lie within a lie, because really it's going to be quasi-private with the profits to the multinational private banks.
[00:11:01.945 --> 00:11:05.427]  So it's just the Federal Reserve is usurping the government.
[00:11:05.807 --> 00:11:07.488]  I don't see it as a nationalization.
[00:11:07.608 --> 00:11:10.989]  I see it as a privatization with nationalization power.
[00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:14.311]  Well, I think you're right, Alex, because they won't
[00:11:14.881 --> 00:11:20.043]  necessarily take away the shares from the current owners of the Federal Reserve, the private owners.
[00:11:20.483 --> 00:11:27.065]  They'll just add a governmental level on top of it and make it nationalized with access to government funds.
[00:11:27.825 --> 00:11:31.747]  And that'll position it to be a counterpart to the European Central Bank.
[00:11:32.507 --> 00:11:40.970]  And the idea, I think, ultimately is, with the amount of money that we're borrowing right now, and I wrote that we're going to have to borrow $2.5 trillion.
[00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.311]  That comes from the Treasury's internal notes.
[00:11:44.889 --> 00:11:45.249]  Stay there.
[00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:47.351]  Let's get into Obama when we get back.
[00:12:07.572 --> 00:12:10.834]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:12:11.014 --> 00:12:15.097]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:12:15.257 --> 00:12:26.705]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:12:26.925 --> 00:12:37.412]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:38.112]  We're good to go!
[00:13:07.773 --> 00:13:13.757]  Unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:13:14.137 --> 00:13:16.119]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:17.800]  But who is the enemy?
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:18.841]  Bin Laden.
[00:13:19.141 --> 00:13:20.141]  This is his ammo.
[00:13:20.161 --> 00:13:21.422]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:13:21.442 --> 00:13:23.163]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:13:23.504 --> 00:13:30.248]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:13:30.649 --> 00:13:31.089]  Some U.S.
[00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:36.753]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:13:37.453 --> 00:13:40.996]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:13:41.337 --> 00:13:51.225]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:13:51.446 --> 00:13:52.186]  Fabled enemies.

[00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.190]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:13.053]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:14:13.213 --> 00:14:21.016]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:14:21.276 --> 00:14:26.639]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:14:26.859 --> 00:14:33.822]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:34.622]  We're good to go!
[00:14:55.865 --> 00:14:58.966]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:14:59.287 --> 00:15:02.808]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:15:03.148 --> 00:15:06.070]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:16.855]  With food prices soaring to all time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:15:17.335 --> 00:15:18.296]  Garden in a can.
[00:15:20.145 --> 00:15:20.385]  I think so.
[00:15:42.367 --> 00:15:46.329]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe, fresh vegetables.
[00:15:46.709 --> 00:15:47.630]  Ready when you are.
[00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.912]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden In A Can.

[00:15:56.975 --> 00:15:57.015]  866-598-7396.
[00:15:57.035 --> 00:15:59.396]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:16:11.766 --> 00:16:13.087]  That's what the bankers are saying.
[00:16:13.107 --> 00:16:17.490]  As they rape, rob, and pillage the entire global economy.
[00:16:20.591 --> 00:16:23.873]  Making the public bankrupt and destitute where they have to take government handouts.
[00:16:24.514 --> 00:16:26.275]  So they can be institutionalized.
[00:16:27.496 --> 00:16:28.776]  So they can be domesticated.
[00:16:30.818 --> 00:16:38.302]  We need the Thomas Pains, the George Washingtons, and the Frederick Douglasses to stand up to this modern tyranny.
[00:16:38.743 --> 00:16:40.544]  This great threat to liberty.
[00:16:42.116 --> 00:16:45.690]  Okay, going back to Dr. Jerome Courtsey in this segment, in the next I'm going to cover a bunch of other news.
[00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:47.535]  It's very important.
[00:16:47.695 --> 00:16:50.816]  Dr. Corsi, on Obama, I mean, where do you start?
[00:16:50.916 --> 00:16:52.996]  They are starting the compulsory youth brigades.
[00:16:53.437 --> 00:16:54.777]  They are taking over the churches.
[00:16:55.197 --> 00:16:56.617]  They are building FEMA camps.
[00:16:56.637 --> 00:16:58.218]  They have the bills introduced.
[00:16:58.238 --> 00:16:59.398]  The camps are already there.
[00:16:59.838 --> 00:17:01.378]  He's gone back on lobbyists.
[00:17:01.398 --> 00:17:07.400]  He's gone back, now he's saying, 16 months, 24 months before they even look at leaving Iraq.
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:12.341]  He has just lied about saying he'd get out of NAFTA and GATT.
[00:17:14.175 --> 00:17:20.419]  I mean, this guy is amazing, and of course, you broke that down, so give us your take on what Obama's up to right now.
[00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:22.600]  Well, I think you're right, Alex.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.161]  I'm going to get into one specific.
[00:17:24.221 --> 00:17:30.805]  I wrote about it in World Med Daily, and I covered it, too, in this week's Red Alert, the economics newsletter.
[00:17:30.825 --> 00:17:32.046]  The L.C.
[00:17:32.086 --> 00:17:42.952]  Hastings, the representative from Florida, introduced the measure for no fewer than 60 detention camps to be built on federal military facilities.
[00:17:43.917 --> 00:17:52.282]  That's the first time I've actually seen legislation introduced for detention camps and to build them on military bases.
[00:17:53.063 --> 00:17:56.345]  When I talked to Hastings' office and said, what are you doing this for?
[00:17:56.385 --> 00:17:59.167]  They said, well, you know, Hurricane Katrina.
[00:17:59.187 --> 00:18:00.447]  I said, wait a minute.
[00:18:01.108 --> 00:18:04.530]  You don't need detention camps in Hurricane Katrina.
[00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:06.811]  What you need is relief centers.
[00:18:06.891 --> 00:18:11.114]  I said, yeah, but maybe a few people have to be detained because they don't evacuate when ordered.
[00:18:11.701 --> 00:18:13.702]  But that's not why you build detention camps.
[00:18:14.542 --> 00:18:17.423]  And that Hastings office didn't have any real good answer for that.
[00:18:18.023 --> 00:18:22.325]  But they're doing, see, what Obama's done is he's gotten, and this guy L.C.
[00:18:22.345 --> 00:18:39.811]  Hastings is a impeached federal judge that found a district in Florida, a very extreme leftist, said some really outrageous and inflammatory things about Sarah Palin, but he introduces the legislation to do the detention camps and it stays below the radar.
[00:18:40.595 --> 00:18:43.380]  But yet it's the Obama Administration forcing the agenda.
[00:18:44.321 --> 00:18:49.510]  Unless we wrote about it in World Net Daily, people wouldn't know about it because nobody else reported on it.
[00:18:50.732 --> 00:18:53.316]  And that's just one example of how, you know, there's...
[00:18:53.772 --> 00:18:56.153]  I'm going to write another one again for tomorrow.
[00:18:56.493 --> 00:19:10.640]  Well, Doctor, specifically though in the bill, it's got the clergy response teams that we first discovered with the secret FEMA documents years ago saying that preachers, local police, all of it's going to be merged into these in the community.
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:16.803]  They've already built the camps, now they're just announcing they're going to build more and going mainstream with it.
[00:19:17.704 --> 00:19:22.046]  Well, and also, Alex, I found the Department of Defense directive on this new
[00:19:22.731 --> 00:19:26.554]  You know, civilian quasi-military force Obama's going to create.
[00:19:27.114 --> 00:19:29.456]  They said it will ultimately be larger than the army.
[00:19:30.036 --> 00:19:34.980]  You know, the civilian corps, people recruited, they're going to have camps for them.
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.802]  But I've got the Department of Defense directive.
[00:19:38.383 --> 00:19:47.009]  So instead of going to Congress to get this new civilian corps created, what Obama did is he did it through a Department of Defense directive.
[00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:49.871]  Which again, did not get picked up and reported on.
[00:19:50.695 --> 00:19:55.576]  I found the directive and I'm not going to be able in Wilbur Daily this week to expose that.
[00:19:55.596 --> 00:20:09.539]  I mean, it's why, when you say these are contrived crises, you know that it's why the red alert, what I'm trying to do in the red alert is to alert people to the economics that are going to affect their lives.
[00:20:10.339 --> 00:20:17.340]  You know, you've got the car industry, the car industry is in desperate trouble, but yet for the bailout money,
[00:20:17.987 --> 00:20:22.468]  You've got one of the major companies, I think it's GM, we just reported on it.
[00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:23.168]  It is GM.
[00:20:23.208 --> 00:20:24.568]  A billion to move to Brazil.
[00:20:24.768 --> 00:20:25.549]  Go ahead in your own words.
[00:20:25.569 --> 00:20:26.049]  To Brazil.
[00:20:26.649 --> 00:20:28.409]  Yeah, a billion to move to Brazil.
[00:20:28.889 --> 00:20:30.590]  Now how's that going to help build U.S.
[00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:31.030]  jobs?
[00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:41.172]  You know, as part of the agenda, there you're building an international car industry where, like I said, in ten years we might not have a single car built in the United States.
[00:20:41.932 --> 00:20:46.933]  That's the internationalization of the car industry as being done through a bailout
[00:20:47.711 --> 00:20:52.996]  You know, bailout money being used with GM saying this is the way we need to be profitable.
[00:20:53.816 --> 00:21:00.122]  I'm sure that the majority listeners never intended the bailout money was going to be used to send car jobs to Brazil.
[00:21:02.323 --> 00:21:04.165]  That's part of the internationalization.
[00:21:04.745 --> 00:21:06.127]  Going back to the FEMA camps.
[00:21:08.046 --> 00:21:19.109]  He has started this new usaservice.org that's private, his own private army, and is running these ads with federal money in the ads council to get the volunteers.
[00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:26.672]  And now on the White House website today, they admit that it's going to be, quote, for the climate crisis and other things.
[00:21:26.792 --> 00:21:28.312]  So, they mean business.
[00:21:29.212 --> 00:21:30.073]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:21:30.113 --> 00:21:34.354]  I've got the Department of Defense directive that creates that new civilian corps.
[00:21:35.186 --> 00:21:44.753]  And I was reading it, I just found it over the weekend, this morning I was reading it, it calls even in military situations where the civilian corps could be called up.
[00:21:45.353 --> 00:21:47.394]  Oh, I know, we wrote a story about it two weeks ago.
[00:21:47.735 --> 00:21:55.600]  Stay there, we're going to come right back with Dr. Jerome Corsi in a final segment with him, more on the Obama agenda, what we're going to see his globalist handlers do.
[00:21:56.321 --> 00:21:57.401]  Will the Obamanoids wake up?
[00:21:57.441 --> 00:22:00.403]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:22:01.344 --> 00:22:04.026]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:07.953 --> 00:22:13.417]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:22:13.457 --> 00:22:13.978]  and the world.
[00:22:14.258 --> 00:22:17.700]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:22:18.121 --> 00:22:24.345]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest in dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:22:24.625 --> 00:22:26.407]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:22:26.647 --> 00:22:34.593]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:39.300]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:22:39.561 --> 00:22:45.109]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.393]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:22:47.573 --> 00:22:49.817]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[00:22:50.137 --> 00:22:50.938]  Free of charge.

[00:22:59.703 --> 00:23:00.484]  Factory direct.
[00:23:00.664 --> 00:23:02.645]  Wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:23:02.905 --> 00:23:06.047]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[00:23:07.148 --> 00:23:12.571]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[00:23:12.871 --> 00:23:14.192]  And we knew what to do.
[00:23:14.212 --> 00:23:15.893]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:23:16.173 --> 00:23:17.895]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film.
[00:23:19.005 --> 00:23:22.591]  That finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:23:23.212 --> 00:23:31.746]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:23:32.113 --> 00:23:38.918]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:23:39.218 --> 00:23:42.261]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[00:23:42.381 --> 00:23:47.585]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:23:48.165 --> 00:23:50.787]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:23:51.228 --> 00:23:58.473]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at
[00:24:01.334 --> 00:24:01.654]  I'm good.
[00:24:26.058 --> 00:24:27.079]  We're good to go.
[00:25:00.299 --> 00:25:00.639]  That's 1-800-313-6400 today!
[00:25:00.659 --> 00:25:03.421]  Dr. Jerome Coursey, in the ten minutes or so we have left with you,
[00:25:20.731 --> 00:25:26.893]  Doesn't matter what president it is, this globalist agenda, the police state, the control grid, the offshore banks, power expands.
[00:25:27.634 --> 00:25:30.415]  All these poor fools thought the bad things happening in the U.S.
[00:25:30.435 --> 00:25:32.055]  were all George Bush when he was just a puppet.
[00:25:32.495 --> 00:25:35.857]  Same thing now with Obama, but they built him up as this messianic leader.
[00:25:36.997 --> 00:25:40.578]  This is still an incredibly tyrannical agenda to get through.
[00:25:40.598 --> 00:25:46.541]  A lot of Obamanoids are now starting to wake up that they were lied to.
[00:25:47.662 --> 00:25:56.488]  But a lot are getting very vicious and very threatening to myself and many others when we simply point out the facts.
[00:25:57.208 --> 00:26:00.330]  And they're building this private army to deal with the American people.
[00:26:00.371 --> 00:26:02.872]  This looks like a recipe for disaster.
[00:26:03.192 --> 00:26:06.795]  We have all these global economic leaders saying that they expect riots worldwide.
[00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:07.495]  It's already started.
[00:26:07.815 --> 00:26:09.296]  The Icelandic government has fallen.
[00:26:10.457 --> 00:26:11.818]  Projecting out into the future.
[00:26:12.178 --> 00:26:17.342]  How do you see this collision between the foundation creation, Obama's mother,
[00:26:18.022 --> 00:26:23.223]  Of course, was the protégé of Mr. Geithner's father.
[00:26:23.623 --> 00:26:25.224]  How do you see this unfolding?
[00:26:26.504 --> 00:26:33.106]  Well, you know, first of all, I think, Alex, you're right, you can't tell the Democrats and the Republicans apart, in terms of they're all globalists.
[00:26:33.926 --> 00:26:39.127]  And now you've got globalism from the left, which has its, you know, socialist agenda.
[00:26:39.607 --> 00:26:44.448]  There will be a lot more putting people on welfare, getting them to be dependent on government checks.
[00:26:45.008 --> 00:26:47.189]  That agenda is going to kick in now under Obama.
[00:26:48.868 --> 00:26:55.532]  I've been pointing out continuously that Obama is going to renege on all of his campaign promises.
[00:26:56.272 --> 00:26:59.254]  He said he was going to renegotiate NAFTA to protect more U.S.
[00:26:59.294 --> 00:26:59.695]  jobs.
[00:27:00.155 --> 00:27:02.777]  He said the same thing at the town meeting in Indiana today.
[00:27:03.337 --> 00:27:09.461]  But yet, the Buy American provisions that were put into the economic stimulus package were taken out.
[00:27:10.101 --> 00:27:17.326]  They added a sentence that said, Buy American in accordance with existing international trade agreements.
[00:27:17.932 --> 00:27:19.713]  Well, that means we're not going to buy America.
[00:27:20.234 --> 00:27:20.854]  It's a lie.
[00:27:21.694 --> 00:27:23.816]  My next book is going to be America for Sale.
[00:27:24.436 --> 00:27:29.520]  And I'm making it clear in America for Sale that there is a New World Order agenda.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.722]  It does call for going to regional and then global economies and governments.
[00:27:34.443 --> 00:27:39.966]  And Alex, it'll be advanced by the real powers here who are not Obama or Bush.
[00:27:40.006 --> 00:27:42.768]  You've got to look to the Trilateral Commission.
[00:27:42.788 --> 00:27:45.310]  You've got to look to the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:27:45.848 --> 00:27:50.492]  You've got to look to the bankers who are controlling and manipulating the financial crises that we're in.
[00:27:50.512 --> 00:27:53.374]  I mean, that's where I'm focusing my attention.
[00:27:53.894 --> 00:27:59.778]  And I'm saying that if we come out of an Obama administration, it's going to be very much weakened with the dollar gone.
[00:27:59.939 --> 00:28:05.763]  I don't see how the dollar is going to survive $6.5 trillion worth of borrowing in the next two years.
[00:28:06.403 --> 00:28:11.067]  We're monetizing our debt, meaning the dollar is going to be increasingly worthless.
[00:28:11.467 --> 00:28:13.629]  We're paying off our debt with worthless dollars.
[00:28:14.571 --> 00:28:16.832]  But people are going to suffer through this period of time.
[00:28:17.372 --> 00:28:20.193]  You know, we've right now got 7.5% unemployment.
[00:28:20.673 --> 00:28:22.634]  What are we going to do when we get 10% unemployment?
[00:28:23.154 --> 00:28:24.975]  What if it goes to 20% unemployment?
[00:28:25.415 --> 00:28:29.676]  And Obama's plan, this economic stimulus plan, is not going to create jobs.
[00:28:30.237 --> 00:28:34.218]  It's just going to put more people on federal-dependent government welfare payments.
[00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:41.601]  And as the dollar's devalued, and people are still getting their welfare checked, but it won't buy anything,
[00:28:42.731 --> 00:28:51.953]  That's when the rioting breaks down, then they use the troops to quell it, now the precedent's been set, the public's been sold, the frightened middle class, the troops on the street's a good thing.
[00:28:53.254 --> 00:29:03.756]  Well, we've only seen, I mean, the fact that this, you know, Representative Hastings has introduced this detention camp measure on military bases, this is the first time I've seen that.
[00:29:03.796 --> 00:29:10.278]  I mean, I reported in 2007 that one of the former Halliburton companies, KBR, has
[00:29:11.356 --> 00:29:18.681]  A $375 million contract with the Palmer Homeland Security to build detention centers as needed on a contingency basis.
[00:29:19.142 --> 00:29:20.062]  This is very different.
[00:29:20.683 --> 00:29:27.107]  The Obama administration openly saying, we're going to have detention centers for civilians on military bases.
[00:29:27.667 --> 00:29:28.848]  Well, what do we need those for?
[00:29:29.428 --> 00:29:34.091]  The only thing I can think of is that, Alex, I think you and I better get our orange jumpsuits ready.
[00:29:34.111 --> 00:29:36.113]  We're probably candidates number one and number two.
[00:29:37.437 --> 00:29:43.301]  I'm not sure which of us is going to be number one, but we're on the list.
[00:29:43.321 --> 00:29:55.729]  And when you get economic conditions worsening and people are going to riot, that's why I'm continuing to write about this in WorldNetDaily and I'm hard at work on this America for Sale.
[00:29:55.749 --> 00:29:57.050]  The next book will be out in the fall.
[00:29:59.085 --> 00:30:04.129]  Now, the Democrats said we were conspiracy theorists when we talked about how they wanted to bring back the Fairness Doctor.
[00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:17.079]  Now we have House members, Senate members, Bill Press writing editorials in the Washington Post saying they are planning to try to have government control over programming, but now the FCC is looking at Internet control as well.
[00:30:17.119 --> 00:30:18.741]  They have the Violent Radicalization Act.
[00:30:20.567 --> 00:30:24.389]  Where they list all these domestic groups and say they want to restrict them.
[00:30:24.449 --> 00:30:30.391]  So as we deepen this tyranny, they can't have the alternative media out there pointing out what's happening.
[00:30:30.411 --> 00:30:31.652]  What do you see happening on that front?
[00:30:32.472 --> 00:30:36.914]  Well, again, I think this whole Fairness Doctrine is something that you've been warning people about.
[00:30:36.974 --> 00:30:38.555]  We've been warning it world-wide daily.
[00:30:39.055 --> 00:30:44.118]  Another one of the things that comes true, you know, the Democrats and Republicans say, oh no, we wouldn't do that.
[00:30:44.858 --> 00:30:49.140]  Now you've got, you know, the idea that there's going to be hearings on the Fairness Doctrine.
[00:30:50.694 --> 00:30:56.899]  The left media, Air America, if it had any audience, it would have succeeded.
[00:30:57.599 --> 00:30:59.680]  Al Franken did everything he could to get it listened to.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.762]  It was boring and uninteresting.
[00:31:02.502 --> 00:31:15.331]  What the globalists in Washington, Republicans and Democrats alike, don't want is an alternative media that's trying to get people listening and telling the truth, people opening their eyes and connecting the dots.
[00:31:16.271 --> 00:31:18.833]  Right now, this whole economic crisis
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.683]  What's being offered as a solution is not a solution.
[00:31:22.743 --> 00:31:24.325]  It will not create jobs.
[00:31:25.426 --> 00:31:30.652]  Obama, we're going to spend nearly a trillion dollars and all we're going to do is increase welfare dependency.
[00:31:30.932 --> 00:31:32.273]  Well, that's my question for you.
[00:31:33.374 --> 00:31:38.239]  That's my final question because I asked it earlier and you really didn't flesh it out because we ran into a break.
[00:31:39.415 --> 00:32:01.090]  What is going to happen as these tens of millions of Obama supporters, the sixty-something million or whatever that voted for him, as things get worse, as they lose their job, as the government welfare check doesn't buy food for their children, as they see, now they're saying 60,000 troops aren't enough in Afghanistan, now they're talking about 100,000.
[00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:07.475]  General James L. Jones, Obama's saying we're going to stay in Iraq now, basically, at least two years, and then look at it.
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:12.083]  I mean, are they just going to drink the Kool-Aid and say, we don't care?
[00:32:12.103 --> 00:32:15.185]  I mean, or are they going to wake up?
[00:32:16.246 --> 00:32:23.591]  Well, there's a certain proportion of Obama believers, maybe 20% of them, that are just hardcore ideologues, and they'll get hardened.
[00:32:23.972 --> 00:32:25.213]  You know, like Rahm Emanuel.
[00:32:25.253 --> 00:32:26.193]  They're ideologues.
[00:32:26.774 --> 00:32:30.997]  They'll rally around Obama and their leftist, globalist agenda no matter what.
[00:32:31.658 --> 00:32:36.101]  But increasingly, you know, running for president is different than being president.
[00:32:36.581 --> 00:32:38.603]  Obama's going to get judged on the results.
[00:32:39.338 --> 00:32:54.430]  And when this trillion dollar bailout does not create jobs, instead we've got more bank failures, more trillions of dollars in assets that go bad, more jobs being lost, the American public is going to start turning on Obama.
[00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:55.511]  You've started to see it.
[00:32:56.231 --> 00:33:00.214]  Obama's not out here in a public relations campaign for no reason at all.
[00:33:00.275 --> 00:33:03.737]  The White House is already worried that his charm is wearing off.
[00:33:04.618 --> 00:33:06.019]  How many smiles are we going to see?
[00:33:06.059 --> 00:33:08.341]  How many campaign speeches are we going to hear?
[00:33:09.093 --> 00:33:10.414]  The results are going to matter.
[00:33:11.034 --> 00:33:15.057]  And if there's not more jobs created, Obama's going to get held responsible.
[00:33:15.577 --> 00:33:17.739]  Not that the Republicans have any better solution.
[00:33:18.279 --> 00:33:20.461]  I've got to hear some Republicans start to tell the truth.
[00:33:20.881 --> 00:33:22.722]  You know, Ron Paul did a pretty good job.
[00:33:23.162 --> 00:33:28.806]  Ron Paul got out there and made a major impact in the presidential campaign.
[00:33:29.206 --> 00:33:34.550]  We've got to have more people like Ron Paul stand up in public office and oppose this globalist agenda.
[00:33:35.862 --> 00:33:36.462]  Absolutely.
[00:33:36.502 --> 00:33:44.608]  Well, Dr. Corsi, we look forward to the new book coming out, and yes, I do need to get your paper back and get it up on the Infowars.com shopping cart that comes out next week.
[00:33:44.628 --> 00:33:54.314]  We do have the second edition you put out of the Lager at USA in hardcover, and it is excellent and has all the SPP documents in it.
[00:33:54.714 --> 00:34:01.699]  It is key for folks to get that book and get them out to people, and we'll keep reading your great columns at World Net Daily and also in the Economic Report they put out, Red Alert.
[00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:02.900]  Thank you so much, Dr. Corsi.
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:04.120]  Thank you.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.882]  It's always a great pleasure and honor to be with you.
[00:34:05.902 --> 00:34:06.703]  I really appreciate it.
[00:34:26.184 --> 00:34:28.226]  Stack of news here that I haven't even gotten into yet.
[00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:34.811]  The biggest issue here is for those of us that do know what's going on, to reach out and wake people up now and spread the word.
[00:34:34.851 --> 00:34:39.715]  You may know all about every facet of this stuff more than I know or more than Lindsey Williams knows.
[00:34:40.035 --> 00:34:42.897]  Together, all of us have the information to defeat this new world order.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.501]  The biggest issue is, don't wait.
[00:34:46.621 --> 00:34:49.562]  Don't think you have to have a perfect solution or fix the whole world yourself.
[00:34:50.062 --> 00:34:51.863]  It's everybody doing a little something.
[00:34:51.923 --> 00:34:57.685]  And the biggest thing I know of, what has been the most effective waking people up, is my documentary films and other films we carry.
[00:34:57.765 --> 00:35:00.145]  I mean, you know, I produced Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:01.126]  Loose Change has had
[00:35:02.006 --> 00:35:05.669]  Conservatively, over 100 million views just on Google Video alone.
[00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:17.360]  My other films that I've directed have had, conservatively, in-game, and other films before Google took the hit counters off, had had 20, 30, 40 million views apiece.
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.103]  We're not even trying to track this, it's just what we can see.
[00:35:21.806 --> 00:35:29.013]  Well, it's also important to not just spread the word about the fact that all the videos are online for free and we promote them, to have the high quality DVD.
[00:35:29.373 --> 00:35:34.838]  To reach out to your boss or your neighbor or your employees or your church and educate people.
[00:35:34.858 --> 00:35:46.349]  Because the establishment is out there with their preachers that they've paid for covertly, their InfraGard executives, they're creating this huge Obama Corps to go out and create the illusion of grassroots support of all this because they need that.
[00:35:47.119 --> 00:35:47.920]  They need the people.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.941]  Well, we are the people.
[00:35:49.001 --> 00:35:51.923]  We've got to say no and counter them.
[00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:53.705]  This is a fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:53.745 --> 00:35:56.828]  You can't just say I listen to Alex Jones anymore and that's the end of it.
[00:35:57.748 --> 00:35:58.689]  Great, you're informed.
[00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:00.371]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:36:01.892 --> 00:36:03.393]  Quite frankly, I've had discussions with my wife.
[00:36:03.413 --> 00:36:04.995]  Should we take a little bit of savings we've got?
[00:36:05.615 --> 00:36:06.816]  Should we run to the Cook Islands?
[00:36:07.742 --> 00:36:09.522]  That's where the elite are going, I don't know why.
[00:36:10.162 --> 00:36:12.883]  Should we try to run to Switzerland and run enough money to move there?
[00:36:13.223 --> 00:36:14.323]  Should we run somewhere else?
[00:36:14.363 --> 00:36:16.584]  No, Mexico's imploding, everything else is imploding.
[00:36:16.824 --> 00:36:18.004]  This is a global depression.
[00:36:18.444 --> 00:36:23.165]  We've made the decision, despite the fact I have three small children, to stay here and go down with the ship.
[00:36:23.945 --> 00:36:25.565]  This is the fight of our lives, folks.
[00:36:25.605 --> 00:36:26.345]  This is history.
[00:36:26.825 --> 00:36:28.586]  There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
[00:36:28.606 --> 00:36:34.907]  The bottom line out there is we all have to intensify our fight against the globalists now.
[00:36:36.203 --> 00:36:47.065]  And that's why I'm taking the savings we have and I'm putting it right back into hiring more people, more video editors, more webmasters, trying to up the quality of this show, do another TV show, do weekly news reports.
[00:36:48.328 --> 00:36:56.113]  It's just taken us months to move, months to get everything set up, months to get the money to put in the equipment, months to hire the people, months to get them trained, but we're trying.
[00:36:56.133 --> 00:36:59.775]  That's why I ask my crew to work extra hard and think on their feet and innovate.
[00:37:00.095 --> 00:37:01.016]  Because this is real.
[00:37:01.096 --> 00:37:02.577]  We're doing something historical here.
[00:37:03.137 --> 00:37:05.839]  And people are listening by the tens of millions.
[00:37:06.219 --> 00:37:09.541]  Now are you going to take action and say, tell everybody about the free podcast?
[00:37:09.841 --> 00:37:14.384]  I think this is the most effective show, the best guest, the best information, the best track record of covering real issues.
[00:37:16.109 --> 00:37:25.894]  It's up to you if Kurt Nimmo writes an article off the Washington Post where they admit the Security Council, National Security Council's taking over the whole federal government, the states, under NORTHCOM, under the FEMA camps.
[00:37:26.575 --> 00:37:27.935]  Is that story going to go viral?
[00:37:28.256 --> 00:37:29.456]  Are you going to post it on Twitter?
[00:37:29.676 --> 00:37:31.537]  Are you going to post it on Delicious?
[00:37:31.838 --> 00:37:33.859]  Are you going to post it on the hundreds of social networks?
[00:37:34.159 --> 00:37:35.860]  Are you going to make sure everybody sees it?
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.321]  Are you going to print off a hundred copies?
[00:37:37.341 --> 00:37:41.143]  Why don't you take the article, go into Kinko's, got a thousand copies printed of it.
[00:37:41.883 --> 00:37:49.208]  You know, are you going to get Fabled Enemies by Jason Bermas, the hardcore 9-11 film, the latest one out there with the latest info, and make copies of it?
[00:37:49.248 --> 00:37:49.849]  We want you to.
[00:37:50.129 --> 00:37:53.531]  Are you going to get Truth Rising, just an amazing documentary film I made?
[00:37:53.771 --> 00:37:57.694]  Are you going to get Barry Cooper's Never Get Busted Part 1 and Part 2 to understand the police state tactics?
[00:37:57.934 --> 00:38:08.682]  Are you going to get the Rosetta Stone, the Master Key to understanding the New World Order, the best film out there with just general knowledge of who they are, what their agenda is, and how they say in their own words, they want to kill you and your family.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.401]  I mean, I'm sorry that sounds crazy.
[00:38:12.102 --> 00:38:12.642]  It's true!
[00:38:13.783 --> 00:38:15.544]  The Money Masters, three and a half hour film, 1995.
[00:38:15.784 --> 00:38:18.766]  The entire history of the banking system, who they are.
[00:38:21.207 --> 00:38:22.048]  It is up to you.
[00:38:22.108 --> 00:38:29.112]  And of course, this new film we're carrying, The Eye of the Phoenix, Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 3, Secrets of the Dollar Bill.
[00:38:30.073 --> 00:38:33.234]  Amazing film, right now available at InfoWars.com.
[00:38:39.645 --> 00:38:44.791]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, it is up to you to support our sponsors, to spread the word about the show.
[00:38:44.811 --> 00:38:47.795]  The free podcast, 125,000 people a day downloading it for free.
[00:38:48.155 --> 00:38:48.836]  That should be 50 million!
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.440]  I mean, think about it.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:39:05.765]  We're here two years ago telling you, we're not geniuses, here's the Gardasil trials, it's killing lots of people that take it, it doesn't protect you from the cervical cancer, they admit, and it's very, very dangerous, and a large percentage of people get crippled from it if they don't get killed.
[00:39:06.205 --> 00:39:07.426]  Now it's on CBS News.
[00:39:08.006 --> 00:39:15.489]  If I'd have been talking to 20, 30 million people every day instead of 2 million, and if the 2 million of you out there would have gotten the articles, gotten the documents,
[00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:18.750]  And told people we could have saved even more lives.
[00:39:18.831 --> 00:39:22.232]  Now, regardless, you know, of that, we did save a lot of lives and you saved a lot of lives.
[00:39:22.553 --> 00:39:23.553]  Those of you that did spread the word.
[00:39:23.573 --> 00:39:24.534]  But this is hardcore.
[00:39:24.974 --> 00:39:31.538]  If you knew your neighbor was about to drink a glass of iced tea that had been poisoned, wouldn't you run over and warn them?
[00:39:31.998 --> 00:39:35.800]  Well, you know your neighbors are about to give their daughters stuff that's going to mess them up really bad if they're lucky.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:36.961]  Kill them if they're not.
[00:39:38.254 --> 00:39:43.026]  This is serious, folks, and I burn with desire to reach more people.
[00:39:43.246 --> 00:39:47.697]  I burn with desire to get this information out to everybody.
[00:39:49.184 --> 00:39:50.706]  I hope you're burning with that same desire.
[00:39:50.726 --> 00:39:53.389]  We're going to come back and take calls in the next segment.
[00:39:53.409 --> 00:39:55.571]  After that, we're going to have the state rep on.
[00:39:55.911 --> 00:39:58.654]  Speaking of paying the bills, one way we do it is those documentary films.
[00:39:58.674 --> 00:40:02.879]  You know, I've done a couple hours and haven't even gotten into our sponsors that make this show possible.
[00:40:02.899 --> 00:40:06.643]  Today's sponsors are Kola Blue, eFoods Direct, and My Solar Backup.
[00:40:07.084 --> 00:40:08.485]  And all of these are great folks.
[00:40:09.466 --> 00:40:14.191]  The Ecola Blue isn't just seven filters inside and grabbing water out of the air.
[00:40:14.651 --> 00:40:19.496]  It's a computer system that lets you know the humidity, how much water you've got, it heats the water in there.
[00:40:22.399 --> 00:40:26.203]  And they've got a lot of different units, big ones, small ones, a lot of different price ranges.
[00:40:26.323 --> 00:40:26.944]  Check them out!
[00:40:28.573 --> 00:40:40.120]  800-691-6043, 800-691-6043, or E-C-O-L-O-Blue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:40.841]  A Cola Blue.
[00:40:41.761 --> 00:40:45.384]  Grab seven and a half gallons of water out of the air every single day.
[00:40:45.424 --> 00:40:49.606]  Talk about, you know, getting off the water system with the sodium fluoride and the rest of it.
[00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:53.429]  Another sponsor is eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:40:54.909 --> 00:40:56.329]  They've got a sampler pack.
[00:40:56.409 --> 00:41:00.210]  It's a three-day first responder, is what it's called.
[00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:02.550]  One adult food supply for three days, $21.95.
[00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:08.091]  Non-GMO, no MSG, no aspartame, no additives.
[00:41:08.511 --> 00:41:10.132]  High quality, tasty food.
[00:41:11.232 --> 00:41:14.032]  It's like 25-30% of what supermarket food cost is.
[00:41:15.232 --> 00:41:18.693]  They're selling this unit at cost, just as a test pack for you to check it out.
[00:41:19.213 --> 00:41:21.714]  Go to E, the letter E, foodsdirect.com.
[00:41:21.834 --> 00:41:22.934]  Efoodsdirect.com.

[00:41:36.363 --> 00:41:38.625]  Okay, that said, we're going to go on a break.
[00:41:39.506 --> 00:41:40.987]  I'm going to come back and take your calls.
[00:41:41.387 --> 00:41:43.949]  Please have your question or comment ready so I can get everybody else after you.
[00:41:44.469 --> 00:41:46.391]  And then I'm going to get into all this news I haven't covered.
[00:41:46.411 --> 00:41:48.232]  Now, I see these articles every few days.
[00:41:49.147 --> 00:41:51.068]  If you think I'm here trying to bash the police, I'm not.
[00:41:51.168 --> 00:41:51.808]  I'm sick of it.
[00:41:51.848 --> 00:41:52.868]  It makes me sick at heart.
[00:41:53.168 --> 00:41:54.028]  It freaks me out.
[00:41:54.068 --> 00:41:56.549]  It makes me feel guilty that I'm still in this country.
[00:41:57.609 --> 00:42:01.070]  I get selfish and I look at my children and go, I gotta get out of here, man!
[00:42:03.291 --> 00:42:04.431]  Just like Mexico now.
[00:42:04.571 --> 00:42:06.492]  You go down there, the police shake you down and rob you.
[00:42:06.952 --> 00:42:09.632]  Property seizures seen as piracy.
[00:42:10.273 --> 00:42:11.173]  San Antonio
[00:42:12.637 --> 00:42:18.759]  Express News today, it's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and it says no judge, no jury, no arrest.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:25.822]  A great-grandmother, they stole $4,000 out of her purse and then never even charged her.
[00:42:25.862 --> 00:42:26.642]  Nothing was illegal.
[00:42:26.682 --> 00:42:30.144]  I mean, folks, they have the state police doing this on I-35.
[00:42:30.504 --> 00:42:37.186]  This is what America has turned into, is robbers in uniforms robbing people, and it's going on all over the country.
[00:42:37.646 --> 00:42:40.948]  And it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse.
[00:42:41.008 --> 00:42:41.788]  I've got stories here.
[00:42:43.462 --> 00:42:47.746]  A story, fire claims building at CCTV Beijing headquarters, Reuters.
[00:42:48.086 --> 00:42:51.029]  The thing's been burning with 200-foot flames shooting out of it.
[00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:53.412]  Watson said 30-foot, it's more like 200-foot.
[00:42:53.872 --> 00:42:58.656]  And nothing collapsed, because buildings don't collapse from fire, but buildings 7, Tower 1 and 2 sure did.
[00:42:58.677 --> 00:43:03.701]  So we'll get into that story that's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as well.
[00:43:04.082 --> 00:43:05.183]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:05.203 --> 00:43:06.264]  Your call is straight ahead.
[00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:15.512]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[00:43:15.932 --> 00:43:17.113]  You need the Paclite!
[00:43:17.533 --> 00:43:25.395]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[00:43:25.775 --> 00:43:28.936]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[00:43:29.316 --> 00:43:33.757]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[00:43:34.158 --> 00:43:35.418]  The Paclite is so durable,
[00:43:35.698 --> 00:43:40.083]  Soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[00:43:40.523 --> 00:43:44.827]  The Paclite comes with a 25 year warranty, and prices start at just $12.99.
[00:43:45.188 --> 00:43:51.874]  To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this small flashlight can be, visit 9voltlite.com.
[00:43:52.195 --> 00:43:54.757]  That address again is 9voltlite.com.
[00:43:57.347 --> 00:43:57.547]  At 877-715-4448.
[00:43:57.607 --> 00:43:57.887]  That's 877-715-4448.
[00:43:57.947 --> 00:44:02.411]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:44:02.431 --> 00:44:04.492]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:16.812 --> 00:44:17.833]  But who is the enemy?
[00:44:18.353 --> 00:44:18.833]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:19.153 --> 00:44:20.114]  This is his M.O.
[00:44:20.134 --> 00:44:21.434]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:21.514 --> 00:44:23.115]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:23.515 --> 00:44:30.259]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:30.659 --> 00:44:31.099]  Some U.S.
[00:44:31.139 --> 00:44:36.802]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:37.482 --> 00:44:40.963]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:40.983 --> 00:44:43.144]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:45:09.031 --> 00:45:11.014]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[00:45:11.615 --> 00:45:14.098]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[00:45:14.679 --> 00:45:18.845]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[00:45:19.614 --> 00:45:21.355]  You know that you need to prepare.
[00:45:21.715 --> 00:45:24.736]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[00:45:25.116 --> 00:45:28.097]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[00:45:28.417 --> 00:45:39.801]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds and survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[00:45:40.201 --> 00:45:46.183]  Imagine growing your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass, fruits, herbs, rice, tea, coffee, and
[00:45:46.323 --> 00:45:46.683]  Big job!
[00:45:46.983 --> 00:45:47.203]  Big job!
[00:46:13.203 --> 00:46:15.745]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[00:46:15.785 --> 00:46:17.786]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[00:46:18.187 --> 00:46:21.149]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[00:46:21.229 --> 00:46:24.911]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lip to Big John.
[00:46:25.312 --> 00:46:26.553]  Big John!
[00:46:26.613 --> 00:46:27.713]  Big John!
[00:46:29.375 --> 00:46:31.996]  Big John!
[00:46:32.217 --> 00:46:33.798]  Big Bad John!
[00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:39.254]  All right, let's go ahead and uh... nobody knew where John come from.
[00:46:39.274 --> 00:46:44.017]  I've seen the song, Torturing You.
[00:46:44.798 --> 00:46:53.085]  All right, let's talk to Steve in Chicago, then Brian, Jake, Issa, Arthur and others.
[00:46:53.785 --> 00:46:55.687]  You are on to the year, Steve, go ahead.
[00:46:56.527 --> 00:47:02.212]  Alex, did you cover the former Congressman Abner Mikva federal judge connection of the Obama
[00:47:03.595 --> 00:47:05.176]  I've read about it, why don't you cover it?
[00:47:06.016 --> 00:47:29.008]  Well, it talks about how when Obama graduated law school that he had an invitation to join the law firm of Abner Mikva on Michigan Avenue, and Mikva became his political advisor, and he told him to observe public speakers like Mandela and
[00:47:30.179 --> 00:47:34.701]  Study the speeches of Martin Luther King and become proficient in it.
[00:47:37.182 --> 00:47:40.603]  This guy is connected to the University of Chicago, Rockefeller.
[00:47:41.043 --> 00:47:46.646]  No, no, his mom was a big foundation head underneath Geithner's dad.
[00:47:48.086 --> 00:47:48.426]  Okay.
[00:47:49.267 --> 00:47:58.591]  The other issue is, I don't know if you covered it with the inauguration that Obama's step-grandmother wanted to bring a Luau spirit to it from the Luau tribe.
[00:48:00.845 --> 00:48:01.746]  Did you cover that today?
[00:48:01.926 --> 00:48:05.428]  Yeah, I know that he won't see his brothers and sisters and won't take care of them.
[00:48:05.508 --> 00:48:09.831]  And they live in horrible squalor in New York and Boston and Kenya.
[00:48:09.991 --> 00:48:13.673]  And, you know, I've got family that doesn't have a lot of money and I try to help them out.
[00:48:13.713 --> 00:48:18.296]  I can't imagine not taking care of your brothers and sisters and your grandma and people like that.
[00:48:19.176 --> 00:48:23.439]  Well, the situation is she couldn't bring it on for security reasons, that spear.
[00:48:23.819 --> 00:48:29.963]  So she brought an oxtail to be used as a fly swatter, as a gift.
[00:48:30.328 --> 00:48:31.847]  And a three-legged footstool.
[00:48:32.344 --> 00:48:34.425]  Okay, I mean, so you're making fun of his family.
[00:48:34.845 --> 00:48:39.088]  You know, the bigger issue here is, you understand you helped the New World Order doing that, and I appreciate your call.
[00:48:39.728 --> 00:48:42.189]  You know, making it all about Obama, that's what they want.
[00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:44.551]  The guy is a front man, just like George Bush.
[00:48:45.131 --> 00:48:48.713]  And until we make it about the real issues, we're never going to be able to wake people up.
[00:48:48.733 --> 00:48:53.776]  You know, when Limbaugh attacks him for phony reasons, that only makes the left supporting more.
[00:48:54.076 --> 00:48:54.616]  You understand that?
[00:48:54.636 --> 00:48:57.498]  The left-right paradigm only empowers the New World Order.
[00:48:57.998 --> 00:49:00.079]  But, haha, you know, she brought an oxtail.
[00:49:00.119 --> 00:49:00.780]  No, I didn't hear that.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.521]  I'm not trying to be mean to you, Steve.
[00:49:02.541 --> 00:49:04.342]  It's just, you know, come on.
[00:49:04.402 --> 00:49:06.183]  Brian in Canada, you're on the air.
[00:49:06.223 --> 00:49:06.664]  Go ahead.
[00:49:07.304 --> 00:49:07.804]  Hi, Alex.
[00:49:08.325 --> 00:49:08.565]  Hi.
[00:49:09.706 --> 00:49:11.287]  I'd like to mention three things.
[00:49:11.347 --> 00:49:18.271]  First of all, I received my copy of Endgame, so I've started working a lot harder with that because it's a wicked tool.
[00:49:18.291 --> 00:49:18.932]  Thank you.
[00:49:18.952 --> 00:49:20.573]  I've already woken up quite a few people.
[00:49:20.613 --> 00:49:22.694]  I thank you greatly for your explanations.
[00:49:24.155 --> 00:49:27.838]  Secondly, I'd like to let people know to fix this kind of in in Canada because
[00:49:28.444 --> 00:49:32.927]  They just hired a guy for a liberal leader as Michael Ignatieff.
[00:49:33.468 --> 00:49:37.811]  He's a globalist, so hasn't even been here for 25 years, but he still claims to be Canadian.
[00:49:38.231 --> 00:49:45.136]  He's been off writing books and making documentaries about the problems of the world and how we need to find global solutions.
[00:49:45.876 --> 00:49:51.200]  And as a matter of fact, Nicolas Sarkozy came here to give a Legion Honours to Jean Charest.
[00:49:51.781 --> 00:49:58.344]  And he threw out to the separatists that separation was a thing of the past, it's a bad idea, and he's talking... Yeah, it's globalism!
[00:49:58.784 --> 00:50:01.425]  They create the global problems, they offer the global solution.
[00:50:01.726 --> 00:50:09.809]  Yeah, I imagine that's why Sarkozy came to give him the honor, because of the good job that he did pulling the wolves... Yeah, there's all sorts of New World Order people everywhere, yeah.
[00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:15.952]  And I'm gonna send you a link to a woman that lives here in Canada, in Granby, in Quebec.
[00:50:16.412 --> 00:50:17.573]  She's an ex-doctor.
[00:50:18.197 --> 00:50:22.858]  And what she's decided to do is completely separate herself from the Queen, from everything.
[00:50:23.238 --> 00:50:30.120]  She's put in a death to her name as a slave, and she's written books about it, and she talks about everything that we talk about.
[00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:31.921]  All right, good to hear from you.
[00:50:31.941 --> 00:50:33.701]  Appreciate the call, Brian.
[00:50:34.341 --> 00:50:39.262]  Jake, Issa, Arthur, Scott, and others, your call straight ahead as we enter the fourth hour.
[00:50:40.363 --> 00:50:45.084]  And we'll also be live at PrisonPlanet.tv simulcasting, and we have a state rep coming on.
[00:50:48.922 --> 00:50:51.023]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:51.543 --> 00:50:54.904]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:57.125 --> 00:50:57.705]  Hello, friends.
[00:50:57.745 --> 00:50:58.705]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:50:58.826 --> 00:51:03.407]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:51:03.547 --> 00:51:06.308]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:51:06.508 --> 00:51:09.389]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:09.569 --> 00:51:14.271]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:14.511 --> 00:51:15.412]  If you simply prepare.
[00:51:15.633 --> 00:51:18.577]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:18.877 --> 00:51:25.787]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:51:25.867 --> 00:51:29.011]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:51:29.151 --> 00:51:29.412]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:31.815 --> 00:51:34.076]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:51:34.296 --> 00:51:40.359]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:51:40.539 --> 00:51:44.300]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.561]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:51:45.601 --> 00:51:46.261]  Take action today.
[00:51:46.301 --> 00:51:48.122]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:59.835 --> 00:52:01.761]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:52:02.242 --> 00:52:05.011]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:10.819 --> 00:52:14.780]  We are now already into hour number four.
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.080]  We have a state rep coming on.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:24.341]  One of the states is introducing legislation, or states that have passed legislation, like Oklahoma, to kick the feds out of martial law, as declared.
[00:52:24.362 --> 00:52:26.082]  He's joining us coming up in the next segment.
[00:52:26.482 --> 00:52:28.442]  Right now, let's go back to your calls.
[00:52:29.042 --> 00:52:30.683]  Jake in Salt Lake City, Utah.
[00:52:31.163 --> 00:52:32.223]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:52:32.263 --> 00:52:32.943]  Thanks for calling.
[00:52:33.603 --> 00:52:34.503]  I appreciate it, Alex.
[00:52:35.003 --> 00:52:36.524]  First time caller, long time listener, bud.
[00:52:37.064 --> 00:52:37.804]  Good to have you on board.
[00:52:38.943 --> 00:52:43.124]  I loved what you said in Endgame as far as the answer to 1984 being 1776.
[00:52:43.584 --> 00:52:45.824]  I think that starts on the local level.
[00:52:46.124 --> 00:52:49.965]  I think that, you know, everybody listening out there needs to be a part of at least three groups.
[00:52:50.605 --> 00:52:52.325]  You know, 10 to 20 people meet weekly.
[00:52:52.966 --> 00:52:53.706]  Just compare notes.
[00:52:55.146 --> 00:52:59.107]  Also, you're pushing... Yeah, just start meeting and everything will roll forward from there.
[00:52:59.567 --> 00:53:00.087]  Exactly.
[00:53:00.287 --> 00:53:06.128]  You're pushing for a lot of people, you know, planting seeds, having gardens, having self-sufficiency with food storage.
[00:53:07.705 --> 00:53:10.052]  The problem is you're not going to be awake 24 hours a day.
[00:53:10.072 --> 00:53:11.597]  You really need to have security systems.
[00:53:13.058 --> 00:53:15.099]  Military comes through with their defoliator.
[00:53:15.139 --> 00:53:18.241]  More than just getting ourselves ready, because I'm not even doing that a lot for myself.
[00:53:18.661 --> 00:53:19.542]  We've got to do something.
[00:53:19.602 --> 00:53:20.842]  Food, water, guns, things like that.
[00:53:21.483 --> 00:53:26.445]  Just try to wake up and expose the globalists, because if their agenda gets discredited, the whole thing will stall.
[00:53:26.866 --> 00:53:28.987]  What they're doing is a very dangerous maneuver.
[00:53:29.007 --> 00:53:33.489]  They don't stand a very good chance of being able to play it all out.
[00:53:33.529 --> 00:53:37.091]  They intend to probably fail, then they just try again, try again.
[00:53:37.111 --> 00:53:38.512]  This is an eternal battle.
[00:53:39.175 --> 00:53:40.596]  Take HR 45, for example.
[00:53:40.616 --> 00:53:42.959]  You know, they're trying to limit, you know, misdemeanor access.
[00:53:42.979 --> 00:53:46.422]  They did that five years ago with Lautenberg, you know, as far as domestic violence cases go.
[00:53:46.903 --> 00:53:48.004]  So, I'm with you, bro.
[00:53:48.024 --> 00:53:49.665]  No, I hear you.
[00:53:49.685 --> 00:53:50.126]  What's up?
[00:53:50.806 --> 00:53:57.833]  The last thing I wanted to get to was there's a lot of movement with the Minuteman organization, specifically regarding the borders.
[00:53:58.554 --> 00:54:01.537]  And I know you're down in Texas, so you deal with that a little more than I do in Salt Lake here.
[00:54:04.113 --> 00:54:06.454]  They are letting them through the Feds.
[00:54:06.574 --> 00:54:08.034]  We're talking ICE, the FBI.
[00:54:08.394 --> 00:54:10.915]  They're... No, the murder is legal, but it's all fake.
[00:54:10.975 --> 00:54:15.136]  I mean, Houston's released hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens every year that they arrest out of their jails.
[00:54:15.156 --> 00:54:16.396]  They tell the cops, don't even arrest them.
[00:54:17.317 --> 00:54:18.357]  Anyway, I appreciate the time.
[00:54:18.897 --> 00:54:20.018]  I'm going to let you get back to it.
[00:54:20.038 --> 00:54:20.778]  That was it.
[00:54:21.278 --> 00:54:24.859]  Alright, speaking of that, later after the state reps on with us, I have an article here
[00:54:26.724 --> 00:54:29.485]  Where 16 illegals sue Arizona Rancher.
[00:54:29.505 --> 00:54:31.146]  They robbed his house, other ones did.
[00:54:31.866 --> 00:54:33.486]  Killed his cattle, did a bunch of stuff.
[00:54:34.347 --> 00:54:38.888]  And they're saying you're not allowed to kick people off your land if they're illegal aliens.
[00:54:39.368 --> 00:54:40.829]  Illegal aliens are above the law.
[00:54:40.849 --> 00:54:42.950]  16 illegals sue Arizona Rancher.
[00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:46.231]  And I interviewed this rancher years ago.
[00:54:46.251 --> 00:54:48.372]  So we're going to be having him on and covering that.
[00:54:48.412 --> 00:54:51.293]  Let's go to ESA in Los Angeles, California.
[00:54:51.313 --> 00:54:51.853]  You're on the air.
[00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:58.720]  Going once, going twice, Issa.
[00:54:59.801 --> 00:55:01.641]  Arthur in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[00:55:01.661 --> 00:55:05.061]  Okay?
[00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:05.762]  Hello?
[00:55:06.262 --> 00:55:06.942]  Yes, go ahead, Arthur.
[00:55:06.962 --> 00:55:09.422]  How you doing?
[00:55:09.482 --> 00:55:09.762]  Good.
[00:55:09.962 --> 00:55:10.842]  Is this Alex?
[00:55:11.142 --> 00:55:11.482]  Yes, sir.
[00:55:11.502 --> 00:55:12.003]  You're on the air.
[00:55:12.023 --> 00:55:13.143]  Oh, hi.
[00:55:13.163 --> 00:55:13.783]  How you doing?
[00:55:14.063 --> 00:55:14.403]  Good, sir.
[00:55:15.263 --> 00:55:18.344]  I'd like to thank you for letting me be on your wonderful radio show.
[00:55:19.664 --> 00:55:22.124]  First of all, I'd like to congratulate you.
[00:55:22.304 --> 00:55:26.305]  I love the content you've given to the world about the economy.
[00:55:26.741 --> 00:55:32.146]  And what I feel is, though, what people need to do, they need to learn how to create their own economy and a bad economy.
[00:55:32.766 --> 00:55:33.487]  Because the U.S.
[00:55:33.547 --> 00:55:38.892]  dollar is toxic, and all currencies are backed by gold, silver, oil, and land.
[00:55:39.272 --> 00:55:49.501]  So what people need to focus on, they need to learn how to become sellers of commodities, like real money, like gold, silver, oil, land, copper, food, and water.
[00:55:49.821 --> 00:55:54.445]  When you go to the grocery stores, you purchase goods, which is food and water.
[00:55:54.921 --> 00:56:00.662]  And what people need to learn how to do is get on the internet and learn how to become sellers of crime.
[00:56:00.762 --> 00:56:05.603]  Yeah, people need to quit going to all these ball games and screwing around and worrying about wearing the cool clothes.
[00:56:05.983 --> 00:56:10.184]  People have got to get serious on waking people up and getting themselves prepared.
[00:56:10.404 --> 00:56:12.544]  We personally take care of ourselves and get ready.
[00:56:12.864 --> 00:56:17.305]  We also reach out and scream bloody murder so that the globalists can't get away with their agenda.
[00:56:18.285 --> 00:56:19.565]  Right, right, exactly.
[00:56:20.185 --> 00:56:21.466]  So, the U.S.
[00:56:21.506 --> 00:56:24.086]  Federal Reserve Bank is basically a joke.
[00:56:25.078 --> 00:56:26.499]  And the U.S.
[00:56:26.539 --> 00:56:29.741]  Federal Reserve is nothing in reserve, and it's nothing federal.
[00:56:30.182 --> 00:56:38.287]  It's basically a private bank that's owned by private stockholders, and it's basically run purely on private profits.
[00:56:39.128 --> 00:56:51.516]  So, if that's the case, then, where you have the blue-collar workers and the white-collar workers with taxes coming out of their paychecks, and we all want paychecks away from being bankrupt,
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:55.461]  Those taxes are going right back into that private sector.
[00:56:56.122 --> 00:56:57.162]  So if people...
[00:57:07.222 --> 00:57:17.010]  South Summit dot com is the place for top name brand knives such as Kershaw, Spyderco, Cold Steel, Gerber, K-Bar, Boker, Leatherman, and more.

[00:58:04.164 --> 00:58:13.713]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:58:14.093 --> 00:58:15.775]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:17.731]  But who is the enemy?
[00:58:18.251 --> 00:58:18.752]  Bin Laden.
[00:58:19.052 --> 00:58:20.053]  This is his M.O.
[00:58:20.073 --> 00:58:21.354]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:58:21.414 --> 00:58:23.076]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:58:23.416 --> 00:58:30.162]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:58:30.562 --> 00:58:31.003]  Some U.S.
[00:58:31.063 --> 00:58:36.728]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:58:37.388 --> 00:58:40.850]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:43.052]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:59:07.413 --> 00:59:11.696]  Rough roads might be ahead for the economy, but your vehicle doesn't have to experience them.

[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:12.383]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:12.703 --> 01:00:15.005]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:18.075 --> 01:00:21.719]  I'm looking at the screen of Infowars.com, the Newsweek headline.
[01:00:22.139 --> 01:00:24.001]  We are all socialists now.
[01:00:24.842 --> 01:00:31.228]  This isn't socialism or foreign offshore banks come in and bankrupt the economy, create fiat money and give it to the public.
[01:00:32.049 --> 01:00:33.250]  Most of us aren't even going to the public.
[01:00:34.062 --> 01:00:36.002]  This is feudalism.
[01:00:36.403 --> 01:00:37.163]  This is serfs.
[01:00:37.223 --> 01:00:40.124]  I should read, we're all feudal serfs now.
[01:00:40.644 --> 01:00:42.384]  This happens a lot with state reps.
[01:00:43.724 --> 01:00:53.747]  Our next guest, Representative Matt Schia, is on the floor right now and should be voting in the next few minutes and should be in here with us to talk about
[01:00:55.776 --> 01:01:07.625]  Well, the report that Kurt Nemo did last week, increasing number of states declaring sovereignty, it was eight states, now several more are doing it, saying no to martial law.
[01:01:07.645 --> 01:01:17.293]  Then I have some of the state bill examples here, where they say we're saying no to martial law, we're not going into the FEMA camps, we're not going along with this system.
[01:01:17.693 --> 01:01:22.857]  But while we wait for the state rep to join us, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:01:25.216 --> 01:01:25.516]  Yes, I am.
[01:01:25.536 --> 01:01:28.839]  Basically, I was actually saying that with all the taxes that's coming out of
[01:01:51.958 --> 01:02:00.144]  People that are blue-collar workers and white-collar workers, including the rich, all of that money is going right back into the private sector, which is the U.S.
[01:02:00.225 --> 01:02:02.146]  Federal Reserve as a banking cartel.
[01:02:03.227 --> 01:02:06.609]  And it's made up of a bunch of savvy international investors.
[01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:13.555]  It's designed that way, it was written that way when they passed that law back in 1913, which would be the Federal Act.
[01:02:14.255 --> 01:02:19.339]  Yeah, they take our tax money and then private groups get it and invest it and buy everything up.
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.641]  Right, exactly.
[01:02:22.128 --> 01:02:30.776]  So, what you're doing, and you know, what I was saying, that deep ed lines become sellers of commodities, especially informational products.
[01:02:30.876 --> 01:02:32.797]  And I was looking at your website the other day.
[01:02:32.817 --> 01:02:35.079]  I was very impressed by what I've seen.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.684]  You need to basically get the information out there to educate the people.
[01:02:40.484 --> 01:02:46.029]  And, you know, I also teach people how to hedge their own money.
[01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:49.172]  So, you're putting your money into something that's going to survive a currency crash.
[01:02:49.679 --> 01:02:50.380]  Like silver.
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:53.983]  Silver is an industrial precious metal and gold is hoarder.
[01:02:54.683 --> 01:02:55.684]  Silver is consumed.
[01:02:55.845 --> 01:03:00.389]  So I'm basically investing into a precious metal that's consumed throughout the whole entire world.
[01:03:00.909 --> 01:03:07.295]  Well, metals have certainly done a lot better than all the other major commodities and investments and I appreciate your call.
[01:03:07.315 --> 01:03:08.075]  Good to hear from you.
[01:03:09.056 --> 01:03:09.997]  Good points, Arthur.
[01:03:10.838 --> 01:03:13.140]  Let's talk, we got Arthur and then down here we got Merlin.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.942]  We got Arthur and Merlin on the air today with us.
[01:03:16.946 --> 01:03:20.667]  You have done well, Lord Arthur, said Merlin Pendragon.
[01:03:20.687 --> 01:03:24.627]  It was actually Arthur Pendragon, and then Merlin, I guess, didn't have a last name.
[01:03:25.688 --> 01:03:27.268]  Let's talk to Scott in Seattle.
[01:03:27.288 --> 01:03:28.688]  We'll get to Merlin in a moment.
[01:03:29.208 --> 01:03:30.229]  Scott, you're on the air.
[01:03:31.629 --> 01:03:36.470]  Alex, it's an honor to speak with you, and I predict when the smoke clears, you're going to be regarded as a hero.
[01:03:37.090 --> 01:03:43.091]  But my reason for calling is to ask you to predict more specifically the progression of events that might unfold
[01:03:43.621 --> 01:03:47.313]  Resulting from the steps being taken by the current cast of controllers.
[01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:52.473]  Well, you know, I tried to cover that in an in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:03:52.693 --> 01:03:56.576]  You know, made two years ago, and we break down exactly what they're doing now and what their final agenda is.
[01:03:56.656 --> 01:04:17.493]  It's destroy the economy, make us feudal serfs-slaves, stage terror attacks against shadowy, non-existent enemies, so they have a pretext to use police state crackdown measures on the public, and then start forcing more vaccines on people that publicly kill you, and then just institutionalizing that you take the shots and you get handicapped or died.
[01:04:18.450 --> 01:04:21.453]  Then they'll start having controlled biological releases on the cities.
[01:04:22.053 --> 01:04:31.341]  Even if the military found out about it and said, no, the entire military is going to be robotic drones and combat mechs by 2012, almost all the fighters will be.
[01:04:31.861 --> 01:04:35.144]  So they're converting it over to a technocracy that a tiny elite can control.
[01:04:35.604 --> 01:04:42.490]  Everything's being designed worldwide so a tiny group can rule the planet through monetary, religious, economic, military.
[01:04:43.791 --> 01:04:44.812]  Let me ask you one more.
[01:04:46.673 --> 01:04:46.813]  Hello?
[01:04:48.177 --> 01:04:49.578]  Let me ask you one more question.
[01:04:50.098 --> 01:05:10.369]  Being that the system, our monetary system, is based on a central bank and the Federal Reserve and the fiat money system, have you heard anything about redemption in law where one secures their straw man through filing their UCC-1, and how effective would you think that would be in shutting down this program they've implemented for years?
[01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:11.410]  It's not real.
[01:05:12.483 --> 01:05:22.328]  The only thing that works in that is that if you drop out of the system and stop paying taxes, there's now over 45 million non-filers who are of working age according to federal numbers.
[01:05:22.368 --> 01:05:25.470]  I've recently seen it was 30 million just five, six years ago.
[01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:26.511]  It's now over 40 million.
[01:05:27.898 --> 01:05:30.300]  I believe it's above 45 million, but you can Google those numbers.
[01:05:30.841 --> 01:05:33.704]  And so, that's why they want the cashless society.
[01:05:33.744 --> 01:05:44.675]  The no-fly list with all these innocent people, over a million on it, Homeland Security admits, I'll never forget Governor Ridge on C-SPAN saying it, to have a job you'll have to have that national ID card that's really globally standardized.
[01:05:45.876 --> 01:05:51.581]  They're going to have a national sales tax, which is going to be graduated, so poor folks won't have to pay it, but you've got to swipe your card
[01:05:52.847 --> 01:05:57.932]  To assess how much sales tax you're supposed to pay and what bracket.
[01:05:58.412 --> 01:06:02.856]  And so even if you're not in the bracket, if you fall below that, you've still got to swipe your card.
[01:06:03.296 --> 01:06:04.538]  It isn't even about the tax.
[01:06:04.598 --> 01:06:07.340]  It's about tracking everything you buy, sell, and do.
[01:06:08.021 --> 01:06:16.989]  So I've noticed gyms, libraries, government buildings make you thumb scan the clock in and out, tanning salons now.
[01:06:17.369 --> 01:06:22.373]  People told me about it, and I walked into one the other day and looked, and there was the dark tans that live here in Austin.
[01:06:22.553 --> 01:06:24.114]  They make you thumbprint when you're a member.
[01:06:25.455 --> 01:06:31.099]  And I've read the corporate documents from these big biometric consortium conferences that they've had.
[01:06:33.035 --> 01:06:45.926]  These conventions they've had, where they say everything will be tracked, everything will be traced, it's Pentagon designed, the Pentagon writes the basic parameters and the rules under Patriot Act compliance and everybody just adopts it.
[01:06:46.246 --> 01:06:51.611]  So what's going to happen is, there is no law, there is no getting around it, they're not following the law.
[01:06:51.971 --> 01:06:54.773]  They will just send armed thugs after you if you don't pay the taxes.
[01:06:55.094 --> 01:06:57.356]  But because so many people said no and aren't doing it,
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:00.621]  They're now moving to try to block barter.
[01:07:01.121 --> 01:07:11.685]  They're trying to shut down farms and ranches with animal ID, premises ID, so you've got to be registered and have the... they're running ID tag ads on the news saying you've got to have them in your animal although there's no law.
[01:07:12.386 --> 01:07:23.890]  I heard that on KLBJ last night out of there doing the Syndicated Sunday Show and heard the ad from the Department of Agriculture saying, get the great tracker tag for your cow, the 440O or something.
[01:07:24.411 --> 01:07:27.352]  I mean, it's just everywhere to shut down barter
[01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:33.692]  And then you won't be able to get barter, and it's going to be a serious prison sentence if you're caught.
[01:07:33.712 --> 01:07:37.833]  They're trying to pass laws to shut down even garage sales.
[01:07:38.614 --> 01:07:42.195]  And then you're going to have that national ID card, your driver's license or ID.
[01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:44.896]  They're going to swipe that, and even if you have money in the bank,
[01:07:45.496 --> 01:07:46.877]  It's a no-buy list.
[01:07:46.937 --> 01:07:48.177]  It's a no-travel list.
[01:07:48.477 --> 01:07:50.538]  And you think, well, I'll just get in my car and drive down the road.
[01:07:51.058 --> 01:07:55.820]  The license plate reading cameras will then identify your car.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.861]  They will face scan when you get out of the car.
[01:07:58.881 --> 01:08:01.642]  These cameras are already up nationwide for at least eight, nine years.
[01:08:02.142 --> 01:08:03.383]  Testing them 15 years ago.
[01:08:03.683 --> 01:08:09.509]  It'll be scanned that you're not the face that matches with that car and all units will be called.
[01:08:09.809 --> 01:08:14.153]  You'll have all these, you know, government minions who couldn't get other jobs as paramilitary police.
[01:08:14.513 --> 01:08:15.814]  An armored wagon will pull up.
[01:08:15.874 --> 01:08:19.918]  You're going to be somebody traveling without your proper code.
[01:08:19.938 --> 01:08:21.619]  They're going to pull out automatic weapons.
[01:08:21.659 --> 01:08:23.160]  If you resist, they're going to kill you.
[01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:25.603]  Then they're going to take you in the vehicle.
[01:08:25.903 --> 01:08:27.064]  They're going to take you to a FEMA camp.
[01:08:28.644 --> 01:08:29.004]  Okay.
[01:08:29.184 --> 01:08:30.925]  Alex, I sure appreciate the fight, man.
[01:08:30.965 --> 01:08:35.388]  You're a true soldier, and you're really inspiring to fight for us up here in Washington.
[01:08:35.428 --> 01:08:36.169]  Thank you very much.
[01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.409]  God bless.
[01:08:36.429 --> 01:08:36.829]  Thank you.
[01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:37.529]  Thank you.
[01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:44.073]  And what's going to happen is, at first people, they're going to do it, you know, they arrest you now sometimes if you're on the no-fly list.
[01:08:44.093 --> 01:08:45.274]  You're like, but I've done nothing wrong.
[01:08:45.854 --> 01:08:47.275]  And they go ahead and take you into custody.
[01:08:47.955 --> 01:08:51.718]  That's just acclimating you to be lined up, to be searched, to have to take your shoes off.
[01:08:52.118 --> 01:08:54.099]  It'll start happening at checkpoints on the road.
[01:08:54.139 --> 01:08:56.901]  Well, we're here to stop illegal aliens, but they'll kind of wink-wink to them.
[01:08:57.441 --> 01:09:01.382]  They'll grab citizens, and people will get let out of the camps, and they'll be, yeah, they're not that bad.
[01:09:01.402 --> 01:09:07.903]  You get processed in, they get you ID'd, and then if you get caught again without the ID, you're... Take Fallujah.
[01:09:07.923 --> 01:09:18.646]  The Pentagon admitted in MIT Technology Magazine a year ago, well, a year ago, I was picking up food at the Cypress Grill.
[01:09:20.645 --> 01:09:21.365]  Propaganda is everywhere.
[01:09:21.405 --> 01:09:30.267]  I sit down, the food's not ready yet, I sit down at the bar, order a beer, and I'm sitting there and there's a rack of magazines and it's MIT magazine from like two years before.
[01:09:32.127 --> 01:09:35.208]  So it's probably a three-year-old magazine, but it was last year and I flip it open.
[01:09:35.228 --> 01:09:43.989]  I already knew all this, but it was the Pentagon admitting they designed this face scanning camera control grid to track everything we're doing and how they use it in Iraq to control people and how in Fallujah.
[01:09:44.289 --> 01:09:45.550]  This has also been on NBC News.
[01:09:46.050 --> 01:09:47.350]  If you don't have your ID card,
[01:09:48.939 --> 01:09:51.162]  They tell everybody, you must leave the city, we're going to level it.
[01:09:52.043 --> 01:09:53.044]  They destroyed over half of it.
[01:09:53.605 --> 01:09:55.287]  Everybody that didn't leave, they went in and killed.
[01:09:55.667 --> 01:09:58.350]  They used robots, microwave guns, everything on record.
[01:09:58.631 --> 01:09:59.071]  Swords.
[01:09:59.412 --> 01:10:00.052]  Don't believe me?
[01:10:00.172 --> 01:10:01.574]  Combat robots are called swords.
[01:10:02.215 --> 01:10:06.600]  They go in, shoot nerve gas on you, they've got microwave guns, they've got machine guns, they've got mortars.
[01:10:07.501 --> 01:10:08.462]  They send in the robots.
[01:10:09.022 --> 01:10:09.743]  They send in the troops.
[01:10:09.763 --> 01:10:10.603]  They kill everybody.
[01:10:11.024 --> 01:10:17.268]  Then those that are allowed to come back in, if they've been interrogated and tortured in the camp they built outside, they send them into Fallujah.
[01:10:17.809 --> 01:10:21.431]  They send the people back in, but they give them an ID with a face scan, so they already have their face.
[01:10:21.492 --> 01:10:23.173]  Even if you lose the ID, they've got your face.
[01:10:23.713 --> 01:10:28.337]  A thumbprint, a handprint, and your name, and they told them, and this was on NBC News.
[01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:33.200]  It was one week before Tom Brokaw retired, because I've got the video here at the office.
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:33.701]  We've played it.
[01:10:34.401 --> 01:10:38.767]  And he said proudly, he said, if you're caught without your card, you are killed on the spot.
[01:10:39.548 --> 01:10:42.432]  Now, those troops have now done that in every Iraqi city.
[01:10:43.033 --> 01:10:48.901]  And they're coming back home to America, and if you're caught without the card, they just line you up and shoot you.
[01:10:49.242 --> 01:10:50.704]  And that's come out that the troops do that.
[01:10:52.059 --> 01:10:55.000]  And then the internal directors from the Army and the Marines came out.
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:59.522]  They're all told to carry extra arms in their cars in case media's around.
[01:10:59.762 --> 01:11:00.842]  They drop a gun.
[01:11:01.582 --> 01:11:03.663]  They drop a rifle at the scene of each person.
[01:11:04.203 --> 01:11:05.564]  So they execute you.
[01:11:06.004 --> 01:11:07.744]  And they're going to come back and be police officers.
[01:11:07.904 --> 01:11:08.645]  You don't have your card?
[01:11:09.025 --> 01:11:09.545]  Line him up!
[01:11:09.825 --> 01:11:11.086]  You son of a bitch traitor!
[01:11:11.506 --> 01:11:12.066]  Boom!
[01:11:12.126 --> 01:11:13.066]  Right in the back of the head!
[01:11:13.146 --> 01:11:13.586]  Yeah!
[01:11:13.626 --> 01:11:13.927]  Go!
[01:11:14.047 --> 01:11:14.387]  Yeah!
[01:11:14.407 --> 01:11:14.807]  Alright!
[01:11:14.847 --> 01:11:15.347]  Good job!
[01:11:15.547 --> 01:11:17.128]  Can't you see his brains go all over the place?
[01:11:17.408 --> 01:11:17.888]  Damn right!
[01:11:17.908 --> 01:11:18.988]  Let's go to the topless bar!
[01:11:19.248 --> 01:11:19.949]  Hell yeah!
[01:11:19.989 --> 01:11:20.829]  Let's go baby!
[01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:22.610]  That's how we take down America.
[01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:25.873]  Okay, so that's how this works.
[01:11:25.913 --> 01:11:26.874]  And you think I'm joking.
[01:11:27.074 --> 01:11:29.015]  You thought I was joking about everything else that's come true.
[01:11:29.396 --> 01:11:31.037]  I'm telling you, that's what they want here.
[01:11:31.698 --> 01:11:33.399]  It's all Pentagon-designed.
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:36.041]  Let's say you don't even know you're on the list.
[01:11:36.241 --> 01:11:37.522]  You know, as this is all breaking down.
[01:11:38.003 --> 01:11:46.710]  You go in, you swipe your card to get some baby diapers or food or whatever, and they just go, oh, your card's not working, and they know the police are on their way, and all of a sudden,
[01:11:48.251 --> 01:11:50.892]  You just stand up, they walk you outside, take you to a FEMA camp.
[01:11:51.752 --> 01:11:53.072]  And if you resist, they shock you.
[01:11:53.352 --> 01:11:58.734]  You wake up from the Taser, you're in the back of an army truck, hogtied with foreign troops laughing at you.
[01:11:59.514 --> 01:12:04.635]  The last thing you see before they break your neck is a big guy walk right over and go, Die, you son of a bitch!
[01:12:05.136 --> 01:12:06.096]  And they break your neck.
[01:12:07.051 --> 01:12:10.333]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[01:12:10.593 --> 01:12:12.955]  How would you like to be debt free in 90 days?

[01:13:06.864 --> 01:13:08.865]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:13:09.005 --> 01:13:11.385]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:13:11.405 --> 01:13:14.006]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:13:14.026 --> 01:13:15.206]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:13:15.226 --> 01:13:16.847]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:13:16.947 --> 01:13:19.748]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[01:13:19.768 --> 01:13:23.469]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:13:33.136 --> 01:13:37.926]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:13:37.986 --> 01:13:39.088]  An inside job.
[01:13:41.776 --> 01:13:42.837]  How dare you?
[01:13:44.218 --> 01:13:49.281]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:13:49.301 --> 01:13:52.102]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:13:52.202 --> 01:13:58.346]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rises.
[01:13:58.366 --> 01:14:01.248]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.

[01:14:03.769 --> 01:14:06.251]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:14:06.736 --> 01:14:12.961]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:14:13.421 --> 01:14:21.207]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:14:21.528 --> 01:14:27.112]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt?
[01:14:27.452 --> 01:14:29.396]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[01:14:29.696 --> 01:14:34.464]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:14:34.805 --> 01:14:39.433]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:14:40.006 --> 01:14:43.850]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of International Banking Cartel.
[01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:45.371]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:14:45.451 --> 01:14:49.515]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[01:14:54.859 --> 01:14:57.402]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:15:06.052 --> 01:15:10.774]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[01:15:11.134 --> 01:15:17.477]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free, and can greatly benefit the health of the human body.

[01:15:35.165 --> 01:15:40.707]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org today.
[01:15:40.727 --> 01:15:48.649]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future and food will be your greatest asset.
[01:15:49.269 --> 01:15:56.071]  People spend money on all kinds of things, but our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[01:15:56.891 --> 01:15:58.872]  So don't delay, call today.
[01:16:02.355 --> 01:16:05.577]  And see what our powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[01:16:05.597 --> 01:16:14.701]  Hey, you know, FEMA took over part of the Highland Mall.
[01:16:16.082 --> 01:16:17.122]  And we've got video of it.
[01:16:17.142 --> 01:16:17.763]  We've played.
[01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:23.806]  But Joey B, my new producer, he took some photos on his iPhone.
[01:16:25.194 --> 01:16:30.317]  He thought it was a movie they were filming, all these people practicing lining up and going into a little FEMA center.
[01:16:30.677 --> 01:16:36.040]  So we're going to have him in at the very end of the show to talk about that and cover that.
[01:16:36.741 --> 01:16:38.622]  State Rep's supposed to call in here any minute.
[01:16:39.983 --> 01:16:41.224]  Oh great, we have him right now.
[01:16:41.244 --> 01:16:47.667]  Representative Matt Shea out of Washington is our guest.
[01:16:47.687 --> 01:16:53.611]  He has a degree in history and politics, a political science graduate, Gonzaga University School of Law.
[01:16:55.168 --> 01:16:57.772]  And he's also a distinguished military graduate, and it goes on and on.
[01:16:57.812 --> 01:17:02.378]  Was in the Platoon Leader, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, Bosnia-Herzegovina.
[01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:04.240]  He's one of the sponsors.
[01:17:05.571 --> 01:17:08.674]  In fact, I guess he is the author of this bill.
[01:17:08.694 --> 01:17:11.275]  We'll find out from him during this segment and the next.
[01:17:11.335 --> 01:17:13.017]  And this whole week we've got state reps on.
[01:17:13.037 --> 01:17:13.977]  Charles Key tomorrow.
[01:17:15.158 --> 01:17:23.804]  Some of these bills, like the one in New Hampshire, it says we won't allow martial law, gun confiscation, establishment of martial law, forced servitude.
[01:17:24.825 --> 01:17:26.426]  All of that is right there.
[01:17:26.466 --> 01:17:31.070]  So I wanted to get the state rep out of Washington on, Matt Shea.
[01:17:32.543 --> 01:17:33.903]  Representative, good to have you on with us.
[01:17:34.564 --> 01:17:35.444]  Thank you for having me.
[01:17:36.444 --> 01:17:38.625]  So, I've got the text of your bill here, too.
[01:17:39.525 --> 01:17:45.147]  Tell us why you're doing this, having declared that the state is not going to go along with the New World Order.
[01:17:46.008 --> 01:17:51.370]  Well, I think the front cover of Newsweek speaks volumes for why we're doing this.
[01:17:51.690 --> 01:17:58.012]  The front cover of Newsweek this morning, for the listeners that maybe haven't seen it, says, in big, bold letters, we are socialists.
[01:17:58.212 --> 01:17:59.852]  We are all socialists now.
[01:18:00.473 --> 01:18:01.373]  And I think that
[01:18:02.017 --> 01:18:09.241]  That type of federal government intervention and overreaching is exactly why state governments are starting to fight back.
[01:18:09.521 --> 01:18:20.726]  And I think we need to reclaim our sovereignty, particularly over these massive areas where there's unfunded mandates and the federal government is expecting state governments to foot the bill.
[01:18:21.627 --> 01:18:29.811]  Representative Shea, specifically, what is the bill that you've got going through the House there in Washington?
[01:18:29.851 --> 01:18:30.471]  What does it state?
[01:18:31.795 --> 01:18:40.161]  Well, what we're trying to do is send a message to Barack Obama, and I'm going to be general unless you want me to read excerpts of it, which I don't have up yet.
[01:18:40.381 --> 01:18:43.043]  Whatever you'd like, whatever you'd like.
[01:18:43.123 --> 01:18:51.428]  We're sending a message to Barack Obama, the President of the United States, that we are a sovereign state and we want to be treated as such.
[01:18:53.471 --> 01:19:04.377]  Bills like, you know, No Child Left Behind and some of the stuff from the previous administration that has come down with a lot of requirements for state and local governments to implement without any funding sources for it.
[01:19:04.797 --> 01:19:06.078]  We're not going to take that anymore.
[01:19:06.918 --> 01:19:21.686]  I think that it was a very interesting development in California this morning where the Los Angeles County has told the state of California that if you're not going to send our money back to us, that we're not going to send you the tax revenues that we're collecting.
[01:19:22.593 --> 01:19:29.356]  I think this is highlighting what's really turning into, quite frankly, a crisis throughout the United States of funding at the local levels.
[01:19:30.036 --> 01:19:32.717]  Taxpayers can't foot the bill anymore.
[01:19:32.797 --> 01:19:33.678]  We can't take any more
[01:19:35.144 --> 01:19:51.194]  Uh, any more new unfunded mandates and then taxes to follow on after they realize that the programs can't be funded, so... Well, I mean, that's bad enough, but I mean, you've probably seen some of the other bills in Oklahoma and in New Hampshire and places where they're saying, we're not going to allow gun confiscation.
[01:19:51.214 --> 01:19:53.655]  They've introduced bills to ban all semi-autos, as you know.
[01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:54.896]  They've introduced bills...
[01:19:55.456 --> 01:19:58.339]  To register all Americans to do federal psychological testing.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:08.148]  Obama's new AG argued before the Supreme Court for the DC gun ban, so he believes a total ban is the Second Amendment.
[01:20:09.208 --> 01:20:13.412]  They've openly introduced bills for a domestic security force under Obama's control.
[01:20:13.472 --> 01:20:15.814]  I mean, I feel like I woke up in Stalinist Russia.
[01:20:17.336 --> 01:20:20.258]  It sure sounds like it, and you know, and then to have this
[01:20:22.023 --> 01:20:25.064]  Newsweek covers say we are all socialists now this morning.
[01:20:25.084 --> 01:20:27.664]  When I saw that, I just, that came out of my chair.
[01:20:27.684 --> 01:20:35.526]  I think right now we're in a crisis, I think, as state legislators throughout the country.
[01:20:36.147 --> 01:20:44.689]  It's incumbent upon us to take the message of what's happening in our states and our local governments and take it to the President of the United States and say enough is enough.
[01:20:44.789 --> 01:20:45.929]  We're not going to take this anymore.
[01:20:46.833 --> 01:20:54.677]  Interestingly too, Washington State came in under the same compact that Montana did when it became a state back in the late 1800s.
[01:20:54.917 --> 01:21:02.341]  And as part of that compact, we have in our state constitution that we have the right to bear arms in defense of ourselves.
[01:21:02.801 --> 01:21:05.663]  And it's a lot more specific than the federal constitution is.
[01:21:05.683 --> 01:21:11.046]  And I know there's a lot of folks here that are very worried about some legislation coming down.
[01:21:12.395 --> 01:21:19.177]  As you well know, runs on ammunition and guns in sporting goods stores all over the country, but especially in Washington as well.
[01:21:19.338 --> 01:21:29.981]  So, I think this is one of those times in American history where people are starting to wake up, and one of the other reasons for my bill was to help wake people up to this issue.
[01:21:30.382 --> 01:21:33.703]  Well, Representative Shea, if you can stay with us, I know you're very busy.
[01:21:33.743 --> 01:21:36.224]  I'd like to ask you about ten more minutes of questions after the break.
[01:21:36.244 --> 01:21:36.704]  Can you do that?
[01:21:37.324 --> 01:21:37.684]  Perfect.
[01:21:38.225 --> 01:21:38.865]  Okay, good.
[01:21:39.446 --> 01:21:40.867]  This is the battle for the Republic.
[01:21:40.907 --> 01:21:42.628]  This is the time to put up or shut up.
[01:21:43.049 --> 01:21:44.490]  Bush tripled the size of government.
[01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:47.312]  Now Obama is building FEMA camps.
[01:21:47.953 --> 01:21:48.273]  Okay?
[01:21:48.353 --> 01:21:50.195]  I mean, we're in trouble, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:50.455 --> 01:21:52.917]  There's no more time to screw around or suck our thumbs.
[01:21:53.157 --> 01:21:55.319]  Defend the Republic or America goes down.
[01:21:55.399 --> 01:21:56.199]  Stay with us.
[01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:58.221]  We're on the march.
[01:21:58.702 --> 01:22:00.303]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:22:01.224 --> 01:22:03.926]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:07.992 --> 01:22:11.454]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[01:22:11.814 --> 01:22:18.258]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:22:18.899 --> 01:22:19.619]  Curious why?
[01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:30.306]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[01:22:30.826 --> 01:22:33.208]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[01:22:33.549 --> 01:22:35.651]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[01:22:35.691 --> 01:22:36.151]  this fall?
[01:22:36.651 --> 01:22:37.172]  Don't wait.
[01:22:37.572 --> 01:22:41.216]  Learn the food shortage skills that can keep you and your family alive in a crisis.
[01:22:41.536 --> 01:22:44.338]  Get the details at FoodShortageUSA.com.
[01:22:44.859 --> 01:22:46.420]  That's FoodShortageUSA.com.

[01:22:52.284 --> 01:22:53.585]  Don't wait for empty shelves.
[01:22:54.065 --> 01:22:57.328]  Go to foodshortageusa.com while you still have time.
[01:22:57.928 --> 01:23:03.972]  www.foodshortageusa.com or toll-free at 877-327-0365.
[01:23:03.992 --> 01:23:06.454]  Act now.
[01:23:06.474 --> 01:23:13.818]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:23:14.179 --> 01:23:15.840]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:17.833]  Who is the enemy?
[01:23:18.353 --> 01:23:18.834]  Bin Laden.
[01:23:19.154 --> 01:23:20.155]  This is his ammo.
[01:23:20.175 --> 01:23:21.455]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:23:21.495 --> 01:23:23.137]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:23:23.517 --> 01:23:30.262]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:23:30.662 --> 01:23:31.103]  Some U.S.
[01:23:31.143 --> 01:23:36.807]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:23:37.487 --> 01:23:40.968]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:23:40.988 --> 01:23:43.789]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:24:07.190 --> 01:24:12.833]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[01:24:13.013 --> 01:24:18.176]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:24:18.457 --> 01:24:23.520]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:27.402]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[01:24:27.682 --> 01:24:29.383]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[01:24:29.723 --> 01:24:35.707]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:24:35.948 --> 01:24:39.490]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:24:39.730 --> 01:24:44.273]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:24:44.553 --> 01:24:45.334]  Do your part.
[01:24:45.614 --> 01:24:47.876]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[01:24:48.216 --> 01:24:54.360]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:57.062]  Up to the pH of 10, with only 10 drops.

[01:25:03.886 --> 01:25:05.307]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[01:25:22.461 --> 01:25:26.424]  This whole week we've got state reps on who've introduced the bills or are co-sponsors to it.
[01:25:28.766 --> 01:25:30.347]  And I'm looking at the New Hampshire one right here.
[01:25:30.367 --> 01:25:35.592]  It says if gun confiscation starts or martial law is established, the state's not going along with it.
[01:25:36.052 --> 01:25:37.253]  This is one of our only hopes.
[01:25:37.773 --> 01:25:50.504]  Talking to a state representative who's put together this bill in Washington State today, State Representative Matt Shea.
[01:25:52.193 --> 01:26:16.140]  Matt, did you know the National Security Council is now basically going to take over every federal agency outside of Congress, and that in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, it states that the governors will serve at the pleasure of the president during emergencies, will be dual-hatted officers, and that they're deploying 20,000 combat troops, they say, for riot control and crowd control.
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:19.401]  So when you add all of that in, this is very sinister.
[01:26:20.399 --> 01:26:39.863]  It is very sinister, and I think it comes on the heels of a rider to the fiscal year 2007 Defense Authorization Act, which gave the President the ability to federalize National Guard troops without gubernatorial consent in the case of a, quote, national emergency.
[01:26:40.683 --> 01:26:46.404]  And, you know, again, a very loosely defined term, which for a lot of us here in Washington State is very concerning.
[01:26:48.078 --> 01:26:58.882]  In fact, in there, that nexus is in with Presidential Decision Directive 51 that states for any emergency, including economic or any other, designated by the President.
[01:27:00.383 --> 01:27:01.944]  So that could be anything.
[01:27:02.724 --> 01:27:03.484]  It could be anything.
[01:27:03.684 --> 01:27:17.090]  And, you know, for instance, if unemployment continues to rise, as many are predicting it's going to, and there are some folks that are unhappy about that on the streets of Washington and the streets of other
[01:27:17.722 --> 01:27:19.303]  Other states in the Union?
[01:27:20.464 --> 01:27:24.827]  Is that a national emergency and are troops going to be called out to take care of those folks?
[01:27:25.227 --> 01:27:26.668]  You know, exactly what does that mean?
[01:27:26.788 --> 01:27:29.290]  And many of us haven't got a straight answer when we've asked that question.
[01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:36.554]  What are other representatives saying and what chance does this bill have of passing?
[01:27:37.455 --> 01:27:41.297]  Well, we're trying to get it a hearing right now and that's the first step in the process.
[01:27:42.978 --> 01:27:49.163]  A lot of the press coverage is putting pressure on the chairman of the committee to help hear this bill.
[01:27:49.723 --> 01:27:52.505]  But right now, so far, we haven't had any luck getting it a hearing.
[01:27:54.447 --> 01:28:00.331]  It has been absolutely overwhelming, the amount of emails we've received from all over the United States, the amount of phone calls as well.
[01:28:02.693 --> 01:28:04.054]  It's been very encouraging.
[01:28:04.134 --> 01:28:05.916]  So the people want to see this thing heard.
[01:28:05.956 --> 01:28:11.360]  It's a question of does the Democratic majority here in the state of Washington want to hear this bill?
[01:28:12.366 --> 01:28:17.148]  Well, the good news is, if this tyranny continues to unfold, the pressure will mount with the states.
[01:28:17.188 --> 01:28:25.271]  And some states, as you know, like Oklahoma, have passed these resolutions saying no to the New World Order, no to tyranny, no to the FEMA camps, no to the gun confiscation.
[01:28:25.891 --> 01:28:29.952]  And so that is legitimizing the general public speaking out against it.
[01:28:29.972 --> 01:28:31.513]  And more people are now looking into it.
[01:28:31.533 --> 01:28:32.893]  So we're looking at something exponential.
[01:28:32.913 --> 01:28:37.395]  So it's good that you've gotten it written, that you have it waiting to try to get it out there on the floor.
[01:28:39.108 --> 01:28:42.531]  And as you said, people overwhelmingly know what's going on.
[01:28:42.571 --> 01:28:44.352]  I mean, record gun sales by 45%.
[01:28:44.613 --> 01:28:54.781]  The previous record, according to FBI instant background checks, which are really instant registration, shows a 45% increase according to any other previous record.
[01:28:54.901 --> 01:28:59.945]  And the people snatching the firearms and ammo off the shelves only seems to be accelerating.
[01:29:01.026 --> 01:29:01.686]  It really does.
[01:29:01.726 --> 01:29:07.611]  And in the state of Washington, the eastern part of Washington state is extremely conservative.
[01:29:08.614 --> 01:29:13.498]  And the western part of the state, at least in the Seattle area, is obviously very liberal.
[01:29:14.099 --> 01:29:27.669]  And the folks over there in eastern Washington, which is where I'm from near Spokane, they're really concerned about this and they're voting with their pocketbooks and their feet and going to the sports stores and taking ammunition in boxes if they can.
[01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:35.275]  And I think that underscores the concern of a lot of the general public on some of these very socialistic programs that are coming down.
[01:29:35.836 --> 01:29:39.497]  And I would actually start to use the word communism, because it really is what it is.
[01:29:40.277 --> 01:29:50.821]  You know, trying to take over nationalized banks, trying to nationalize different areas of industry, trying to implement this draconian climate change legislation, which is starting to happen here in Washington State.
[01:29:51.421 --> 01:29:55.762]  It's just, it really isn't about the environment, it's not about anything more than control.
[01:29:57.023 --> 01:30:03.365]  Speaking of that, if you go to WhiteHouse.gov, he has announced what he said he would do through his White House Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel.
[01:30:04.676 --> 01:30:11.102]  Having local pastors lead governmental committees to, quote, promote solutions to climate change.
[01:30:11.122 --> 01:30:16.788]  That means the carbon tax, the cap and trade tax, the taxes on what industry and businesses left.
[01:30:17.268 --> 01:30:19.530]  And he's talking about this million man domestic army.
[01:30:19.971 --> 01:30:23.735]  I mean, it's one thing for us to talk about how control freaks were planning this.
[01:30:23.775 --> 01:30:25.336]  It's another thing to see it happening.
[01:30:25.356 --> 01:30:26.017]  Can you speak to that?
[01:30:26.847 --> 01:30:27.688]  Absolutely, I can.
[01:30:27.728 --> 01:30:37.716]  There have been three bills introduced in the state of Washington, and there has been close conversation between Governor Greg Warner in Washington and Barack Obama's administration on these issues.
[01:30:38.537 --> 01:30:41.299]  And I'll give you just a flavor for what this means.
[01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:55.270]  Their own numbers, their people testified before one of the committees that I sit on, Ecology and Parks, and said that this is going to cost the average low-income family $750 per family per year in additional higher energy costs
[01:30:55.774 --> 01:30:56.954]  In higher cost of product.
[01:30:57.275 --> 01:30:58.135]  And that's their numbers.
[01:30:58.255 --> 01:31:04.057]  I would probably double them, as a conservative estimate, to give you a real picture of what that's going to cost the average family.
[01:31:04.417 --> 01:31:05.738]  And that's their people saying it.
[01:31:06.338 --> 01:31:08.239]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:31:08.859 --> 01:31:18.083]  And what I was going to say on top of that, one of the bills they introduced, House Bill 1718 here in Washington State, was going to impose rent control.
[01:31:18.283 --> 01:31:21.284]  Was going to stipulate when
[01:31:22.088 --> 01:31:30.437]  You sold your property that you had to offer the government a first right of refusal if you were within a certain square mile of a transportation hub.
[01:31:31.118 --> 01:31:42.710]  I mean, you could go on and on about this stuff, but the bottom line is it's going to cost businesses, it's going to cost consumers, and quite honestly it's going to shut this nation down as far as manufacturing is concerned, in my opinion.
[01:31:43.516 --> 01:32:02.857]  Now this is on top of the fact that for decades the globalists paid companies to offshore, our industry's basically gone, the retail industry, the service industry's imploding, and now in the midst of all of this, they're going to bring in all these new taxes, Animal ID, Premises ID, what's their goal?
[01:32:02.897 --> 01:32:03.918]  Destroy free enterprise?
[01:32:04.508 --> 01:32:06.630]  Well, their goal again, I think, is control.
[01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:13.074]  I don't think it has anything to do with protecting the environment or preventing diseases among animals.
[01:32:13.414 --> 01:32:15.075]  I think it's about control, bottom line.
[01:32:16.336 --> 01:32:19.919]  Have you seen, I can dig it out, by the number of you who like it,
[01:32:21.089 --> 01:32:24.332]  Have you seen the bill they've introduced to build FEMA camps?
[01:32:24.432 --> 01:32:28.656]  And if you read the language, it's the training I witnessed the military doing years ago and warned the public.
[01:32:28.696 --> 01:32:36.624]  Now it's in a bill to build FEMA camps that have rigs on them and the local pastors help organize it and then
[01:32:37.845 --> 01:32:45.207]  The local police and others through the threat integration centers basically move in under NORTHCOM with FEMA camps.
[01:32:45.807 --> 01:32:56.810]  So total federalization, taking over every facet of society, using transportation corridors as in other bills, you mentioned that at your state level, where they claim they control everything off of highways.
[01:32:56.830 --> 01:32:58.090]  Can you speak to what this looks like?
[01:32:59.591 --> 01:33:02.772]  Well, I am aware of what you're talking about with the FEMA camps.
[01:33:02.812 --> 01:33:10.576]  What's very and most particularly disturbing about that is that they're going to be on former military bases and they're going to use those bases to do that.
[01:33:11.376 --> 01:33:15.618]  A ton of people have expressed their concerns at what they're really building are prison camps.
[01:33:15.658 --> 01:33:17.118]  I think you're just speaking to that right now.
[01:33:18.119 --> 01:33:26.282]  In addition to that, there's some very eerie similarities between using pastors to pacify people
[01:33:27.911 --> 01:33:30.633]  Now, as happened in Nazi Germany.
[01:33:30.973 --> 01:33:32.314]  And I've done some research on that.
[01:33:32.354 --> 01:33:51.984]  There was a paper done by the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA, back at that time on how the Germans and the Nazi Party, in particular, took the churches and turned them into a vehicle to help pacify people and bring them along with their agenda.
[01:33:52.144 --> 01:33:55.446]  And I think it's very scary that that's what's being mentioned right now.
[01:33:56.341 --> 01:33:58.215]  As some people say, there's nothing new under the sun.
[01:33:59.116 --> 01:34:02.439]  Well, sir, I'm glad you're so informed.
[01:34:02.459 --> 01:34:05.521]  That's why we're having all these state reps on this week, and let's just keep it in the next week.
[01:34:05.541 --> 01:34:20.973]  Let's just keep having them on, because there's hundreds of great men and women like yourself, Representative, who are saying this, and as we talk to them, it seems we're all on the same page from history, and I notice your degree is in history, so it's great to talk to somebody who is informed.
[01:34:21.934 --> 01:34:25.877]  Three years ago, another host on this network, Pastor Butch Paul,
[01:34:27.082 --> 01:34:32.427]  was sent secret FEMA documents, then I had the pastor on, then another pastor sent me the same documents, hundreds of pages.
[01:34:33.748 --> 01:34:37.852]  We didn't know he was already under surveillance, so they came to him and threatened him afterwards.
[01:34:38.653 --> 01:34:47.602]  And they had 13,000 preachers covertly hired then to train their flocks for gun confiscation, forced inoculation, to go into the camps.
[01:34:47.822 --> 01:34:48.082]  Then
[01:34:48.943 --> 01:34:51.985]  Obama and Emanuel have announced that indeed they're doing this.
[01:34:52.005 --> 01:35:01.771]  It's on the White House website today and they've doubled the number to 26,000 and now we have mainstream media reports saying, oh the pastors are getting us ready for martial law.
[01:35:02.211 --> 01:35:03.112]  It's a good thing.
[01:35:03.192 --> 01:35:07.555]  Do what they say when the crisis comes and everything will be all right.
[01:35:08.215 --> 01:35:10.657]  Were you aware of those FEMA documents?
[01:35:11.577 --> 01:35:13.979]  I was not aware of those particular FEMA documents.
[01:35:14.539 --> 01:35:15.920]  However, pastors
[01:35:16.522 --> 01:35:26.864]  At least in the state of Washington, and I'm not going to name them for the reasons you stated, are aware about this type of use of pastors to pacify the people.
[01:35:27.585 --> 01:35:30.965]  And they are very concerned about it, number one.
[01:35:31.125 --> 01:35:37.267]  And number two, they are prepared to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, even in that scenario.
[01:35:37.327 --> 01:35:38.247]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:45.992]  Well, since we've got a few more minutes with you, John, pull up the newscast, and I'm just going to play it 30 seconds so he can hear this.
[01:35:46.012 --> 01:35:46.953]  I'm going to give him the title.
[01:35:47.393 --> 01:35:50.754]  This was one out of Louisiana, but we have other newscasts and reports.
[01:35:51.194 --> 01:35:54.395]  Now understand, this is a year and a half after I got secret documents.
[01:35:55.275 --> 01:35:56.916]  John, do you have that for the state rep?
[01:35:57.996 --> 01:35:59.097]  He's pulling it up right now.
[01:35:59.557 --> 01:36:02.358]  Before I play this short clip, any other key points you'd like to add?
[01:36:02.418 --> 01:36:05.719]  How do we, folks all around the country,
[01:36:06.713 --> 01:36:08.133]  How do we support you?
[01:36:08.634 --> 01:36:11.814]  How do we call the State House?
[01:36:11.854 --> 01:36:13.075]  Do we call newspapers?
[01:36:13.115 --> 01:36:14.895]  Do we demand they cover this?
[01:36:14.955 --> 01:36:29.619]  Because, you know, to the general public, I talk about this and some still snicker and giggle, but I mean, now that the Wall Street Journal called for a world government last week, or the Financial Times of London admitted we're going to have a world government run by a few private banks, I think people are finally starting to wake up.
[01:36:29.659 --> 01:36:33.480]  In fact, we found the clip, and I want you to, in summation, close with how we help you
[01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:40.222]  Representative Shea, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, we're going to have the video as well, but for radio listeners, here's the audio.
[01:36:40.482 --> 01:36:42.843]  She says, will martial law... Start it over.
[01:36:42.863 --> 01:36:44.403]  Will martial law ever be declared?
[01:36:44.443 --> 01:36:44.763]  Here it is.
[01:36:45.384 --> 01:36:47.844]  Law ever become a reality in America?
[01:36:48.264 --> 01:36:52.586]  Some fear any nuclear, biological, or chemical attack on U.S.
[01:36:52.626 --> 01:36:54.707]  territory might trigger just that.
[01:36:55.147 --> 01:37:02.129]  And as KSLA News 12's Jeff Ferrell discovered, the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[01:37:03.075 --> 01:37:05.435]  From my cold, dead hand!
[01:37:05.676 --> 01:37:09.856]  Charlton Heston's famous declaration captures a truly American value.
[01:37:10.296 --> 01:37:12.937]  The overarching desire to protect our freedoms.
[01:37:13.617 --> 01:37:19.838]  But gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
[01:37:20.559 --> 01:37:20.839]  U.S.
[01:37:20.879 --> 01:37:22.039]  troops also arrived.
[01:37:22.399 --> 01:37:29.140]  Something far easier to do even now, thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act.
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:30.721]  That forbid U.S.
[01:37:30.781 --> 01:37:32.801]  troops from policing on American soil.
[01:37:35.032 --> 01:37:42.175]  If martial law were enacted here at home, like depicted in the movie The Siege, easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical.
[01:37:42.675 --> 01:37:47.777]  And that's exactly what the Clergy Response Team, as it's called, helped accomplish in New Orleans.
[01:37:48.317 --> 01:37:54.819]  Jeff, the primary thing that we say to anybody is let's cooperate and get this thing over with, and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[01:37:54.839 --> 01:38:00.321]  Alright, it goes on from there, and they talk about Romans 13, Hitler's favorite quote.
[01:38:00.741 --> 01:38:02.302]  Representative, your response to that?
[01:38:03.846 --> 01:38:05.266]  It's, well, it's shocking.
[01:38:05.947 --> 01:38:09.667]  And it's, you know, I think it underscores the concerns that we've been talking about for the last ten minutes.
[01:38:10.628 --> 01:38:11.428]  People need to wake up.
[01:38:11.668 --> 01:38:14.589]  They need to call, you know, they need to call their media sources.
[01:38:14.729 --> 01:38:15.889]  They need to call their legislators.
[01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:21.270]  Here in the state of Washington, the legislative hotline is 1-800-562-6000.
[01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:30.052]  And the chair of the committee where at least this joint memorial is up before is Representative Hunt's committee, Sam Hunt.
[01:38:30.872 --> 01:38:32.653]  And they need to let their legislators know that
[01:38:33.971 --> 01:38:34.592]  They've had enough.
[01:38:35.412 --> 01:38:50.164]  This is looking too much like the precursor to Nazi Germany and Communist Russia, and that they want to have their legislators do something about it, reclaim sovereignty for states specifically, and for the individuals on the ground that are paying taxes.
[01:38:50.364 --> 01:38:53.667]  Please give that phone number out again in the name of the chairman of the committee.
[01:38:54.307 --> 01:38:58.291]  The name of the chairman is Representative Sam Hunt, and the phone number again is 1-800-562-6000.
[01:39:03.815 --> 01:39:15.843]  And also, if anybody wants to reference the paper that I referred to earlier from the Office of Strategic Services, it's called, The Nazi Master Plan, Annex 4, The Persecution of Christian Churches.
[01:39:17.505 --> 01:39:18.245]  Absolutely.
[01:39:18.585 --> 01:39:30.934]  And of course, the Senator Dodd, 68 Gun Control Act, was copied completely, but two words were changed from German, because that Senator Dodd, not the current one, the other one, had been in the Nuremberg trials as a lawyer.
[01:39:31.174 --> 01:39:32.515]  So our gun laws are Nazi.
[01:39:34.187 --> 01:39:44.555]  Yes, and I think there's a very famous quote from Hitler about that, that if you take away guns from the people, they really can't resist anymore.
[01:39:45.176 --> 01:39:49.459]  And a lot of folks don't understand that we have more than three checks and balances.
[01:39:49.479 --> 01:39:52.821]  There's more than just the legislative, judicial, and executive branch in our government.
[01:39:52.841 --> 01:39:54.583]  The fourth check and balance is well-armed people.
[01:39:55.385 --> 01:39:56.466]  It is the cartridge box.
[01:39:56.486 --> 01:40:00.830]  We have the ballot box, the grand jury box, the jury box, and the cartridge box.
[01:40:00.890 --> 01:40:04.593]  And I got a family, I got a nice life, I don't want it to become physical.
[01:40:05.194 --> 01:40:07.376]  But this just isn't socialism or communism.
[01:40:07.416 --> 01:40:12.200]  This appears to be the most classic form of hardcore tyranny.
[01:40:13.682 --> 01:40:14.562]  It really does.
[01:40:15.083 --> 01:40:16.004]  It really does.
[01:40:16.184 --> 01:40:20.648]  And your listeners need to know, there are a lot of state legislators that are very concerned.
[01:40:20.668 --> 01:40:21.609]  You're going to hear about more
[01:40:24.855 --> 01:40:32.181]  Representative Shea, in closing, we really want to stay in touch with you as this develops.
[01:40:35.484 --> 01:40:40.808]  By the very nature of this being so over-the-top, I think that's what takes people back and they just have trouble believing it.
[01:40:42.802 --> 01:40:51.548]  I'm just glad that you're here and that you're following the oath you gave when you were in the Army as an officer and that you're following the oath you gave as a state rep.
[01:40:51.828 --> 01:40:57.311]  Would you like to declare here on record in the spirit of 1776 that you're going to defend the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic?
[01:40:57.992 --> 01:41:02.595]  I'm going to defend the Republic from enemies, all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:41:03.576 --> 01:41:03.856]  All right.
[01:41:03.896 --> 01:41:05.357]  God bless you and we're with you, sir.
[01:41:05.757 --> 01:41:06.357]  God bless you.
[01:41:06.397 --> 01:41:07.298]  Thank you for having me on.
[01:41:07.598 --> 01:41:08.078]  Take care.
[01:41:08.138 --> 01:41:09.719]  Yeah, this is gut check time, folks.
[01:41:09.759 --> 01:41:10.519]  This is real.
[01:41:11.119 --> 01:41:11.580]  This is real.
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:20.564]  We're going to have state rep after state rep after state rep on telling you this is the classic attack pattern of not just a tyranny, of a mass extermination tyranny.
[01:41:21.505 --> 01:41:22.366]  It has a signature.
[01:41:22.847 --> 01:41:23.647]  It has a wavelength.
[01:41:23.707 --> 01:41:25.249]  It has an architecture.
[01:41:25.309 --> 01:41:28.953]  This is the most tyrannical architecture we've ever seen.
[01:41:28.993 --> 01:41:31.516]  It's not just like a Nazi one or a Soviet one.
[01:41:31.596 --> 01:41:37.542]  It is the most vicious attack profile we've ever seen.
[01:41:38.697 --> 01:41:41.699]  The most sneaky, the most backstabbing, the most duplicitous.
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:43.981]  Joey Vee, our new producer.
[01:41:44.101 --> 01:41:45.863]  Oh, we don't even have a camera set up in here!
[01:41:45.883 --> 01:41:47.584]  Because we know we're going to have a guest.
[01:41:47.624 --> 01:41:48.445]  Okay, we've got it over here.
[01:41:48.805 --> 01:41:50.867]  Joey Vee is one of my new producers.
[01:41:50.887 --> 01:41:51.668]  We've got two producers.
[01:41:51.688 --> 01:41:52.969]  We're starting Jason Burmas' show.
[01:41:53.469 --> 01:41:54.430]  Coming up here in a few weeks.
[01:41:54.510 --> 01:41:55.330]  Glad to be here, Alex.
[01:41:55.831 --> 01:41:56.451]  It's good to have you here.
[01:41:56.471 --> 01:42:05.018]  We're going to come back in the final segment, and we are going to get into the FEMA camp you went over and visited over in Holland Mall and some drills you saw going on over there.
[01:42:06.179 --> 01:42:07.901]  You just happened to run into it this weekend.
[01:42:08.301 --> 01:42:16.728]  Before I do that, before we go to break, again, it is sponsors that make this transmission possible, and I want you to know about MySolarBackup.com.
[01:42:17.209 --> 01:42:18.950]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[01:42:18.970 --> 01:42:20.631]  Hurricanes, snow, ice, storms.
[01:42:21.632 --> 01:42:24.695]  And folks, I'm telling you, you need to visit MySolarBackup.com.
[01:42:25.235 --> 01:42:32.902]  You get your emergency power backup kit, which consists of the PowerSource 1800 power plant and high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.

[01:42:54.776 --> 01:42:55.458]  Get sovereign.

[01:46:21.545 --> 01:46:28.214]  Restreams on the internet start in about five minutes at Infowars.com with Lindsey Williams, Dr. Jerome Corsi, and others.
[01:46:30.109 --> 01:46:33.752]  And Joey Vee is our new producer.
[01:46:34.253 --> 01:46:36.535]  We also have Rob Dew out there doing producing.
[01:46:36.555 --> 01:46:39.097]  They're also double teaming, learning how to do the board hopping.
[01:46:39.557 --> 01:46:41.759]  Well, they already know how to do that, but on this system.
[01:46:42.580 --> 01:46:43.901]  And look,
[01:46:45.006 --> 01:46:49.908]  A few months ago we learned that they had taken over a part of the Highland Mall FEMA had for Heretic Kane Ike.
[01:46:50.369 --> 01:46:52.630]  But then after it left, they stayed there and it's in the bills.
[01:46:52.650 --> 01:46:56.512]  They're building these FEMA community centers that then liaison out of the camp.
[01:46:56.552 --> 01:46:58.733]  And I've had people call me say there's people in handcuffs.
[01:46:59.033 --> 01:47:01.574]  They're doing drills of arrest, drills of sending people in there.
[01:47:02.115 --> 01:47:08.158]  And we've shown some video that folks shot locally, the cops and security guards saying get back and Homeland Security buses.
[01:47:08.798 --> 01:47:10.139]  I didn't send Joey Vee out there.
[01:47:10.159 --> 01:47:12.420]  In the future we will have him actually being a reporter as well.
[01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:19.445]  Uh, but he just took a photo on his iPhone and saw what he thought was a movie being shot out there.
[01:47:19.485 --> 01:47:25.990]  So just briefly tell folks, because every time I talk about this I get emails saying I'm a liar, it's not there, they go on my message board and say I'm a liar.
[01:47:26.410 --> 01:47:29.012]  We know it's PsyOps, but tell us what you saw.
[01:47:29.673 --> 01:47:34.337]  Well I was out there probably about two months ago and I thought they were actually doing like a film.
[01:47:35.208 --> 01:47:38.270]  Some sort of a movie production deal was going on.
[01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:50.536]  You see the white trucks everywhere and it was kind of crazy because my wife and I, we were just going to the mall and the parking was extremely limited because they took, I would say about a quarter of the whole parking lot of the whole mall doing all this stuff.
[01:47:50.656 --> 01:47:51.917]  And they're still out there, by the way.
[01:47:51.977 --> 01:47:57.460]  And there's people, you know, they had numbers on them and signs and all this other stuff, people sitting on the sidewalk.
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:03.246]  Then we went back this weekend, and there's a bunch of FEMA vehicles still out there.
[01:48:03.506 --> 01:48:04.428]  You know, the big trucks.
[01:48:04.468 --> 01:48:06.370]  Oh yeah, they took over part of the mall, two of the buildings.
[01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:08.432]  And see, it all sounds reasonable.
[01:48:08.533 --> 01:48:10.855]  Oh, the Army's going to help with car wrecks.
[01:48:10.956 --> 01:48:12.497]  Oh, the Marines are going to help with DWIs.
[01:48:12.718 --> 01:48:16.923]  Oh, but see, FEMA doesn't leave, and they admit they're setting them up everywhere.
[01:48:16.983 --> 01:48:17.503]  Oh, they're there.
[01:48:18.024 --> 01:48:21.306]  They've got orange cones everywhere out there.
[01:48:21.386 --> 01:48:22.386]  Well, we've got video of it.
[01:48:22.406 --> 01:48:24.387]  We can put it on screen, but people still don't believe us.
[01:48:24.828 --> 01:48:25.788]  They just say we're making it.
[01:48:25.848 --> 01:48:26.909]  We just had a state rep on.
[01:48:27.389 --> 01:48:28.650]  You can drive over there and see it.
[01:48:29.790 --> 01:48:30.331]  Plain as day.
[01:48:30.451 --> 01:48:32.432]  Well, it's clearly PSYOPs that go on the website.
[01:48:32.872 --> 01:48:33.952]  I mean, here's an example of PSYOPs.
[01:48:33.992 --> 01:48:34.773]  I meant to get to this today.
[01:48:34.793 --> 01:48:35.593]  I'll get to it tomorrow.
[01:48:36.574 --> 01:48:42.137]  It's still burning in China, a 44-story building, just like Building 7, and nothing's collapsed.
[01:48:43.121 --> 01:48:45.283]  I mean, it's got like 200-foot flames shooting out of it.
[01:48:45.623 --> 01:48:50.788]  And then the first comment in here, they just, the Pentagon admits they have all these PSYOPs and private corporations doing it.
[01:48:51.408 --> 01:48:55.932]  He says, in the 70s, buildings did not use chemical coating called monocoat.
[01:48:55.952 --> 01:49:01.236]  If you drive into a parking garage, you can see gray fur on the load-bearing members.
[01:49:01.417 --> 01:49:02.237]  It's the monocoat.
[01:49:02.277 --> 01:49:04.579]  It's fire retardant used on metal and concrete.
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:05.160]  Oh, really?
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:06.161]  We've had the NIST report.
[01:49:06.781 --> 01:49:12.106]  And we've had underwriting laboratories on report that thing was overbuilt with fireproofing and had more added in 1999.
[01:49:12.406 --> 01:49:14.648]  We believe that was the explosive thermane added.
[01:49:14.948 --> 01:49:18.251]  They admit they used a new experimental thing to later detonate it.
[01:49:19.452 --> 01:49:21.133]  But see how the disinfo operates?
[01:49:21.854 --> 01:49:28.079]  And then it says apparently it did not retard the fires as the entire building was consumed.
[01:49:28.139 --> 01:49:29.981]  What kind of double think is that?
[01:49:30.021 --> 01:49:32.663]  You've been called, the next person says, but they're on there.
[01:49:32.903 --> 01:49:34.965]  And they're on there saying this FEMA thing isn't out there.
[01:49:35.285 --> 01:49:38.727]  No, it's out there, and there's even signs out there that say, do not drive past this point.
[01:49:39.528 --> 01:49:40.128]  On the cones.
[01:49:40.849 --> 01:49:41.409]  So they're there.
[01:49:42.930 --> 01:49:45.312]  Man, I tell you, so what's it like after a week working here?
[01:49:45.852 --> 01:49:46.773]  Nah, it's fun, man.
[01:49:47.554 --> 01:49:49.335]  You know, a lot of information, a lot of stuff.
[01:49:49.355 --> 01:49:57.981]  You get to... See, I've never been through all of this before, I've never known about this sort of information before, but you start noticing things, and it's like, oh, wait a minute.
[01:49:58.661 --> 01:50:03.124]  So just in a week being here, you hear the news here, then you go out and see it in the real world.
[01:50:04.175 --> 01:50:05.216]  And that verifies it for you.
[01:50:05.696 --> 01:50:06.877]  Plus, you're getting a lot of the news now.

[01:50:07.997 --> 01:50:08.237]  Yeah.
[01:50:08.658 --> 01:50:09.738]  I'm getting a lot of emails.

[01:50:19.764 --> 01:50:21.165]  We have a lot of work to do around here.
[01:50:21.185 --> 01:50:24.427]  Paul Hartman and David and everybody else that's in there.
[01:50:24.487 --> 01:50:24.807]  Jaren.
[01:50:24.827 --> 01:50:27.649]  We're going to have a show with a bunch of mics with all you in here.
[01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:30.691]  Maybe all of you co-host with me someday, but you can't clown too much.
[01:50:31.351 --> 01:50:31.831]  Can't clown.
[01:50:31.851 --> 01:50:33.092]  Hey, it's great to have you on board.
[01:50:33.112 --> 01:50:33.852]  Thanks a lot.

[01:50:58.778 --> 01:51:03.405]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:51:03.525 --> 01:51:06.269]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:51:06.489 --> 01:51:09.353]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:51:09.533 --> 01:51:14.260]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:15.381]  If you simply prepare.
[01:51:15.601 --> 01:51:18.543]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:18.843 --> 01:51:25.729]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
