[00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:02.796]  Organicacede.com today!
[00:00:02.816 --> 00:00:10.383]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network!
[00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:20.874]  The military, I mean, they have some serious concerns about what's going to happen in the fall with this flu.
[00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:20.974]  Yep.
[00:00:20.994 --> 00:00:23.255]  Because we'll have two flus at once, obviously.
[00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:25.635]  Regular old every year flu and then this, you know, pig flu.
[00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:26.975]  It's that H1N1.
[00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:33.097]  In case the government asks FEMA for help, the government will be ready there with the military, we're told.
[00:00:33.437 --> 00:00:36.338]  As health officials race to get vaccines ready, the U.S.
[00:00:36.358 --> 00:00:42.279]  government has just gotten 20 million doses and we're told it could be getting ready to start giving those shots by October.
[00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.802]  Even though the trials for these drugs hasn't even begun yet.
[00:00:45.882 --> 00:00:56.812]  Just minutes from now, a panel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta is expected to hold a news conference in Atlanta and give its recommendation on how the new vaccine should be handed out.
[00:00:57.393 --> 00:01:01.496]  We're keeping an eye on that news conference and we'll let you know exactly what happens and all the developments from it.
[00:01:01.516 --> 00:01:03.018]  Our Brian Wilson is covering this.
[00:01:03.058 --> 00:01:07.142]  Brian, the military getting involved, that seems kind of, you know, drastic.
[00:01:07.898 --> 00:01:09.419]  Well, I think it is dramatic, Chef.
[00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:19.926]  Fox News has confirmed that NORTHCOM has a proposal sitting on the desk of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates that would authorize the military to back up FEMA should there be an H1N1 pandemic.
[00:01:20.206 --> 00:01:30.233]  The proposal comes from NORTHCOM Commander Victor Renoir, who wants permission to set up five regional military teams who will respond if FEMA says it needs help.
[00:01:30.613 --> 00:01:34.916]  One assumes this might be necessary, Chef, if there were, for example, mass quarantines.
[00:01:35.316 --> 00:01:36.517]  Mass quarantines.
[00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:37.858]  Mass quarantines.
[00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.862]  Well, there's a hearing today in the Senate on preparing for H1N1.
[00:01:43.142 --> 00:01:44.283]  Where are they with this thing?
[00:01:45.103 --> 00:01:48.045]  Well, the H1N1 vaccine is not completely ready.
[00:01:48.145 --> 00:01:50.707]  They do have some test doses they want to start testing.
[00:01:50.987 --> 00:01:54.430]  Won't be ready for a while, but they do begin to spin a campaign in the fall.
[00:01:55.336 --> 00:02:03.645]  And, Shep, those who should be at the front of the line, adults 19 to 24, we're beginning to hear, because it seems that the H1N1 hits young people the hardest.
[00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:09.312]  Yeah, I guess they saw that here in the United States, but were they seeing that in outbreaks in other parts of the world as well?
[00:02:09.352 --> 00:02:10.893]  I mean, we've learned a lot about this thing recently.
[00:02:11.594 --> 00:02:25.144]  Well, the problem is it keeps changing, and that is the real issue here, is that this one morphs and mutates and comes back in different ways, so they have to be very careful, but they think right now the people at greatest risk are young people 19 to 24.
[00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:30.688]  Alright, Brian Wilson on Capitol Hill, and of course, reminder, we are tracking H1N1.
[00:02:30.788 --> 00:02:32.990]  Can we play that animation again?
[00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.671]  There we go.
[00:02:37.313 --> 00:02:38.133]  Be very afraid.
[00:02:38.153 --> 00:02:39.234]  Be very afraid.
[00:02:39.254 --> 00:02:40.275]  Be very afraid.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.664]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:02:46.684 --> 00:02:48.646]  That's a little YouTube video somebody put together.
[00:02:48.666 --> 00:03:00.077]  You know, we should edit a video together just of all the CNN, Fox, ABC saying there's going to be forced inoculations, the Army is going to make you take the injections.
[00:03:00.858 --> 00:03:02.940]  But it's all for your own good.
[00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.132]  And Northcom that was set up to fight Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:07.532 --> 00:03:10.495]  We promise it's not to fight the American people.
[00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:14.178]  We promise we're only going to use the army against Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:17.321]  And then, oh, Northcom.
[00:03:17.361 --> 00:03:20.524]  You know, you have Southcom and you have CENTCOM.
[00:03:21.024 --> 00:03:21.785]  Well, now you have
[00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:44.435]  Northcom and AFRICOM and all the rest of it, over the United States, out of Colorado Springs, Colorado, and they've announced they're going to put troops on the streets of America, and they train with the police in these drills, and the DHS reports saying gun owners, conservatives, and veterans are the main force that they are prepared for.
[00:03:45.015 --> 00:03:51.440]  And the John Warner Defense Authorization Act states Northcom's main mission is suppressing governors and rogue states.
[00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:55.792]  You see, the federal government was seized by offshore private banks.
[00:03:56.272 --> 00:04:04.055]  According to Bloomberg and the Associated Press and others, congressional hearings the last week, $23.7 trillion.
[00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:05.635]  And that number's a month old.
[00:04:05.655 --> 00:04:07.056]  It always comes out a few months late.
[00:04:07.656 --> 00:04:13.198]  So in nine months from the bailout point, they had stolen $23.7 trillion.
[00:04:13.398 --> 00:04:16.179]  It's now probably more than $25 trillion.
[00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.940]  That is double the GDP of the country, roughly.
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:28.367]  And 9.4, 9.5 trillion would have paid off all mortgages in the United States.
[00:04:30.048 --> 00:04:34.813]  All mortgages, not bad mortgages, not mortgages subprime, not jumbo mortgages.
[00:04:35.534 --> 00:04:46.324]  Every condo, every mansion, every small bungalow, every cottage, every mortgage in America paid off for
[00:04:48.268 --> 00:04:49.029]  Over nine trillion.
[00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:49.889]  It's already 23.7.
[00:04:52.611 --> 00:04:54.912]  And that's not counting another month.
[00:04:55.672 --> 00:04:55.992]  Plus.
[00:04:56.133 --> 00:04:58.934]  So... And they won't say where the money is.
[00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:01.195]  And they brag.
[00:05:01.996 --> 00:05:05.178]  How do you think the IMF and World Bank, when they take over a third world country, run things?
[00:05:05.518 --> 00:05:07.159]  They go in and pay off the politicians.
[00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:09.520]  And the politicians set up a military system.
[00:05:10.421 --> 00:05:11.742]  And they suppress the people.
[00:05:13.262 --> 00:05:13.983]  And they...
[00:05:16.072 --> 00:05:36.010]  Come in and raise taxes and regulations and seize the roads, the ports, the infrastructure, and hand it over to foreign countries, and they turn the major regular highways, freeways, into toll roads, and they triple the water price, and they set up all these systems, and now they're going to have a global government, according to Time, Newsweek, everybody else, but they say it's good, that will tax everybody.
[00:05:38.052 --> 00:05:40.394]  And if you don't like it, NORTHCOM is standing by.
[00:05:43.294 --> 00:05:53.966]  And then they can also run around and fearmonger using the swine flu.
[00:05:55.533 --> 00:05:59.414]  And that is clearly just another drill, another exercise.
[00:05:59.474 --> 00:06:12.456]  We don't know how extreme it's going to be in federalization and the United States, not just being federalized, but under World Health Organization, mainstream UN announcements that they are directing the United States and the rest of the world.
[00:06:12.516 --> 00:06:22.758]  This is a perfect pretext for the state worldwide, controlled by big offshore banks, to crack down and control and enslave their population.
[00:06:22.798 --> 00:06:24.438]  That's what's happening, period.
[00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:30.894]  And they use the Patriot Act thousands of times per year, per state, and non-terror-related.
[00:06:30.934 --> 00:06:33.696]  They're getting rid of the whole Bill of Rights, whole Constitution.
[00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:37.738]  They have warrantless wiretapping in non-terror-related cases now.
[00:06:38.078 --> 00:06:47.724]  The Cybersecurity Command of the NSA and the Air Force admit they're spying on the web, engaging in propaganda on the web, engaging in manipulation.
[00:06:48.384 --> 00:06:51.746]  They are doing all of this right now, everywhere.
[00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:58.972]  And it's just unspeakable.
[00:06:59.272 --> 00:07:01.777]  How is Obama going to get his carbon tax through in the fall?
[00:07:02.097 --> 00:07:04.361]  How's he going to get his socialized healthcare through in the fall?
[00:07:04.741 --> 00:07:07.766]  How's he going to get, quote, amnesty?
[00:07:09.528 --> 00:07:11.229]  Immigration reform through in the fall.
[00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:14.310]  How is he going to get his anti-gun bills that are all introduced through?
[00:07:14.711 --> 00:07:21.034]  How is he going to get his Clean Water Restoration Act that federalizes all above and below water in the country?
[00:07:21.054 --> 00:07:22.554]  The entire nation has water underground.
[00:07:23.095 --> 00:07:24.055]  Total federalization.
[00:07:24.435 --> 00:07:25.956]  No judge, no jury, they just take over.
[00:07:26.396 --> 00:07:30.418]  How are they going to successfully do that?
[00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:34.000]  How are they going to be able to do that?
[00:07:36.481 --> 00:07:37.502]  How is this going to be done?
[00:07:38.942 --> 00:07:40.403]  I'll tell you how this is going to be done.
[00:07:41.743 --> 00:07:53.287]  This is going to be done through fear-mongering, through brinksmanship, and maybe even war with Iran and Pakistan as a distraction and diversion.
[00:07:53.727 --> 00:08:00.610]  Maybe NATO will run another sneak attack on a Russian-controlled territory on its border, like South Ossetia and Georgia on 888 last year.
[00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.511]  Coming up on the anniversary of that in about eight days.
[00:08:05.171 --> 00:08:05.371]  Wow.
[00:08:06.612 --> 00:08:07.212]  Time flies.
[00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:14.604]  And the swine flu.
[00:08:15.445 --> 00:08:15.885]  Clearly.
[00:08:16.546 --> 00:08:21.690]  I mean, we know it's killed less than 200 people in the United States, and that's even puffed up numbers.
[00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:23.832]  We know it's killed less than 2,000 worldwide.
[00:08:24.092 --> 00:08:27.575]  We know the regular flu kills half a million every year, 37,000 in the United States.
[00:08:28.115 --> 00:08:30.217]  Why are they fear-mongering?
[00:08:31.278 --> 00:08:33.700]  Why are they freaking out so bad?
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.922]  Why are they going crazy?
[00:08:36.662 --> 00:08:38.544]  Why is this happening?
[00:08:39.464 --> 00:08:39.825]  Why
[00:08:41.812 --> 00:08:45.135]  Are they already pushing and getting the public ready for forced inoculation?
[00:08:45.455 --> 00:08:47.437]  Why are they announcing troops are going to be on the streets?
[00:08:47.997 --> 00:08:51.120]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, unemployment is above 21% now.
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.322]  And that's even with their Cook numbers.
[00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:58.466]  Things are rapidly deteriorating, fastly, by design.
[00:08:58.486 --> 00:09:02.590]  They're imploding the economy to consolidate, just like they did third world countries, over and over again.
[00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.432]  This is very, very serious.
[00:09:06.533 --> 00:09:08.435]  And this is happening now.
[00:09:10.148 --> 00:09:17.732]  And so I'm begging all of you, the listeners, to get informed and to get involved in your communities and to warn everybody around you.
[00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:38.482]  Remember that before the staged flu outbreak and fear-mongering in Mexico in April, I went on air in March 5th and on other transmissions and said specifically I believe they were going to stage a flu pandemic or fear-mongering to do with flu.
[00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:46.015]  The anthrax attacks run by the feds showed us that it only needs to kill a few people.
[00:09:46.115 --> 00:09:48.657]  It's the fear of it, the stampeding.
[00:09:49.397 --> 00:09:57.182]  You know, how did ancient aboriginals, how did ancient human tribes kill woolly mammoths for food?
[00:09:58.783 --> 00:10:06.588]  That was obviously the prey of choice because, you know, it had hundreds of times the meat that a deer would, per kill.
[00:10:07.765 --> 00:10:14.792]  Humans didn't usually go up against a woolly mammoth or a mastodon just with spears and swords and rocks.
[00:10:15.112 --> 00:10:18.836]  Spears and clubs and rocks.
[00:10:19.176 --> 00:10:20.417]  They didn't have swords, obviously.
[00:10:21.038 --> 00:10:25.863]  They would go up against them by having beaters in the woods.
[00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:30.613]  Or in a field, spread out, beating drums.
[00:10:31.314 --> 00:10:32.955]  And they would drive the mammoth.
[00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:37.439]  You might have a person spread out every 500 yards at first, beating their drums.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.562]  Beating their drums, spread out over a couple miles.
[00:10:41.402 --> 00:10:45.766]  Driving, first in a straight line, then closing in.
[00:10:45.846 --> 00:10:48.068]  This is how sharks and dolphins hunt fish.
[00:10:48.489 --> 00:10:50.410]  Thrasher sharks go in circles around fish.
[00:10:50.751 --> 00:10:52.112]  Get them all into one mass and eat them.
[00:10:52.913 --> 00:10:53.293]  And they
[00:10:55.538 --> 00:11:03.502]  You know, they start in a straight line and start curving in, herding the mastodons towards cliffs, towards ambushes.
[00:11:05.142 --> 00:11:15.107]  And they could get the mastodons, or the woolly mammoths, depending on which subspecies of the pachyderm you're talking about, the elephants.
[00:11:16.748 --> 00:11:18.008]  At first, they wouldn't be that scared.
[00:11:18.028 --> 00:11:19.969]  They'd hear a drum beating and kind of move on.
[00:11:20.369 --> 00:11:23.911]  But the more they got chased, this might go on for, you know, a half a day.
[00:11:24.898 --> 00:11:28.223]  And now people dressed up, you know, in wild paint screaming.
[00:11:28.904 --> 00:11:33.951]  Because once they'd intimidated the elephants to run, the elephants could have stood their ground, turned and fought.
[00:11:34.712 --> 00:11:38.918]  Like humans could against the sign of a dictatorship now, being run by our own species against us.
[00:11:38.938 --> 00:11:40.861]  But the elites say we're a subspecies.
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:50.687]  If you'd like to quit smoking regular cigarettes and try a revolutionary new alternative, this might be the most important
[00:12:14.736 --> 00:12:15.878]  It looks like a cigarette.
[00:12:16.098 --> 00:12:18.121]  It feels and tastes like a cigarette.
[00:12:18.281 --> 00:12:20.424]  And even delivers nicotine like a cigarette.
[00:12:20.524 --> 00:12:26.512]  But because this is not a cigarette, it doesn't deliver toxic chemicals and tar into your lungs or discolor your teeth.
[00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:29.436]  The premium e-cigarette has no flame or ashes.
[00:12:29.736 --> 00:12:33.139]  And you can smoke it anywhere, even where cigarettes are not permitted.
[00:12:33.359 --> 00:12:37.562]  Because the vapor you exhale is only water, not dangerous second-hand smoke.
[00:12:37.762 --> 00:12:38.703]  You've tried the gum.
[00:12:38.863 --> 00:12:39.863]  You've tried the patch.
[00:12:40.083 --> 00:12:41.284]  You've tried cold turkey.
[00:12:41.485 --> 00:12:43.786]  Now it's time to try the premium e-cigarette.
[00:12:43.966 --> 00:12:48.029]  By doing so, you will save 60 to 75% over regular cigarettes.
[00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:51.852]  If you'd like to learn more, visit premiumecigarette.com.
[00:12:52.012 --> 00:12:54.894]  That's premium, the letter E, cigarette.com.

[00:12:59.409 --> 00:13:09.123]  Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources and let me ask just one question.
[00:13:09.864 --> 00:13:12.888]  What would you list as the things that the federal government does really well?
[00:13:13.564 --> 00:13:15.905]  The armed forces and printing bogus money doesn't count.
[00:13:16.445 --> 00:13:22.408]  Now take that blank page of yours and list the ways that you have to protect your assets and escape the paper markets.
[00:13:23.028 --> 00:13:24.848]  The only real option is precious metals.
[00:13:25.369 --> 00:13:31.071]  For your retirement, your kid's education, or just plain survival when the whole Obama mess comes crashing down.
[00:13:32.048 --> 00:13:34.669]  You are the only one you can count on for a stimulus package.
[00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:39.092]  And I'd like to discuss a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your family.
[00:13:39.672 --> 00:13:43.874]  Please give me a call at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:13:44.114 --> 00:13:49.237]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:13:49.717 --> 00:13:52.999]  And together we can develop a Make Sense program before the clock runs out.
[00:13:53.619 --> 00:13:58.181]  Once more, John Swenson at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:13:58.301 --> 00:14:01.003]  And take charge of your future and thank you.
[00:14:04.904 --> 00:14:10.210]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:14:10.731 --> 00:14:17.759]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:24.467]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:14:24.907 --> 00:14:26.709]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:14:26.849 --> 00:14:29.271]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:14:29.351 --> 00:14:40.300]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.221]  It's not about left or right.
[00:14:42.622 --> 00:14:44.023]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:14:44.483 --> 00:14:48.827]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told.
[00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:50.813]  And his real agenda.

[00:14:59.637 --> 00:15:00.778]  The Obama Deception.
[00:15:01.218 --> 00:15:02.399]  The people strike back.
[00:15:04.181 --> 00:15:09.686]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[00:15:10.167 --> 00:15:10.887]  Think about that.
[00:15:10.927 --> 00:15:13.570]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:16.993]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[00:15:17.273 --> 00:15:27.063]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious tasting chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants.
[00:15:27.503 --> 00:15:33.090]  Unlike hard-to-digest pills, Choose for Health is a convenient chewable which allows for better digestion.
[00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.371]  The choice is yours.
[00:15:34.511 --> 00:15:39.798]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet, or a natural chewable product you can better digest.
[00:15:40.118 --> 00:15:40.879]  Choose for Health.
[00:15:41.139 --> 00:15:44.923]  The world's first superfruit, sea vegetable, antioxidant chewable.
[00:15:45.204 --> 00:15:47.667]  Whole food nutrition, not rocks and shells.

[00:16:18.371 --> 00:16:23.537]  If you just tuned in, and you're like, why is this guy talking about woolly mammoths?
[00:16:23.597 --> 00:16:24.719]  About mastodons?
[00:16:25.419 --> 00:16:29.584]  About several species of extinct elephants?
[00:16:32.067 --> 00:16:36.412]  Well, because this is exactly what the globalists do to us.
[00:16:36.432 --> 00:16:37.633]  This is how they hunt us.
[00:16:38.717 --> 00:17:02.411]  And there's a lot of forms of hunting birds, hunting pheasant, where you have beaters in the bush that come out in a straight line, then they start forming a wedge, a pincer, and they push the birds out, and then finally start closing in and push them all out in one group, and then the nobles, the Queen of England, in fact you can probably pull up video, YouTube, Queen of England hunting pheasant, you'll see her standing in a field with woods,
[00:17:03.431 --> 00:17:05.872]  And hundreds of pheasants will suddenly just fly out.
[00:17:06.292 --> 00:17:14.175]  That was people beating the woods on her estate for hours, marching the birds, driving them out, so she can shoot them.
[00:17:15.736 --> 00:17:18.997]  And then, I like hunting myself, but talk about weird.
[00:17:19.037 --> 00:17:24.259]  She, like, enjoys wringing their necks and gets weird looks on her faces, so it's a little bit strange when she does it.
[00:17:25.159 --> 00:17:26.960]  I've seen video of that, I'm sure it's on the web.
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.422]  But the point is, they just released a little anthrax kills of
[00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:39.434]  Ten, fifteen people, I forget the exact number, injures a few hundred, sickens a few hundred, and same thing here.
[00:17:39.454 --> 00:17:43.957]  I mean, they have a couple deaths in Mexico and the U.S., a couple deaths in China.
[00:17:44.297 --> 00:17:48.120]  They act like it's the end of the world, because the media said so.
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:59.127]  Now, I had seen the feds preparing mass graves, gave you secret New York State documents, Indiana documents, Indiana emergency manager witnesses, had them on the show,
[00:18:00.529 --> 00:18:02.351]  And then later, all that came out in news.
[00:18:02.491 --> 00:18:04.092]  Oh yes, we are getting mass graves ready.
[00:18:04.132 --> 00:18:05.774]  We are getting troops ready.
[00:18:05.814 --> 00:18:07.035]  We are getting the army ready.
[00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:13.720]  We are having drills of local police practicing bringing fake vaccine in that militias are trying to steal.
[00:18:14.521 --> 00:18:16.182]  I knew that before April.
[00:18:16.663 --> 00:18:19.465]  They're now telling people they just started all this preparation in April?
[00:18:19.485 --> 00:18:25.530]  Because this is such a big takeover they're using the flu scare as a smoke screen for that
[00:18:26.551 --> 00:18:28.594]  They really started more than a year ago.
[00:18:28.915 --> 00:18:32.621]  We found out about it in January, February, and March.
[00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:34.744]  I did show after show warning you this was coming.
[00:18:35.245 --> 00:18:36.306]  And then April hit.
[00:18:37.697 --> 00:18:39.338]  And I just went on there and said, this is big.
[00:18:39.358 --> 00:18:43.740]  Whether it's a hoax or not, this is a cover story for something big.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.981]  This is probably going to turn into something big in the fall.
[00:18:46.421 --> 00:18:47.701]  Exactly what I said happened there.
[00:18:48.082 --> 00:18:59.046]  And then listeners, I'm so busy always looking forward, they emailed me and said, here's the YouTube of you on your TV show and the radio saying all this would happen in March and laying it all out.
[00:18:59.106 --> 00:18:59.707]  How did you know?
[00:19:00.447 --> 00:19:13.079]  I mean, I wasn't even tooting my horn that I had exactly laid everything out, and that's why I was freaking out in April, going, this is big, this is big, it's happening, because I'd already said it was coming and knew it was happening.
[00:19:14.781 --> 00:19:15.482]  It's just incredible.
[00:19:17.068 --> 00:19:20.512]  So I'm like one of these elephants who's got a little bit of smarts.
[00:19:21.012 --> 00:19:22.053]  And I'm going, wait a minute.
[00:19:22.734 --> 00:19:27.379]  There's only one of those Cro-Magnon every 500 yards or so.
[00:19:27.419 --> 00:19:29.101]  There's hundreds of us elephants.
[00:19:29.841 --> 00:19:30.642]  They're all painted up.
[00:19:31.701 --> 00:19:34.804]  You know, they're wearing antlers and stuff to scare us.
[00:19:35.144 --> 00:19:36.285]  They're yelling, they're screaming.
[00:19:36.305 --> 00:19:38.987]  They hunt lions today in Africa like this.
[00:19:39.287 --> 00:19:44.432]  They beat the bush, drive the lion to where they got hunters waiting with these 15 foot long spears.
[00:19:44.792 --> 00:19:49.856]  And the men, it's key, I've seen them interviewed, the Zulus and others are big lion hunters.
[00:19:50.256 --> 00:19:51.578]  Pull that up, pull up lion hunting.
[00:19:51.918 --> 00:19:52.839]  Zulu lion hunting.
[00:19:52.879 --> 00:19:53.940]  I bet you can find that on YouTube.
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.141]  And they got these long, you know, 15, almost 20 foot spears.
[00:19:57.161 --> 00:19:58.282]  They're huge, long spears.
[00:19:58.562 --> 00:20:01.804]  And the men explain, it's key that they be more aggressive.
[00:20:01.824 --> 00:20:03.244]  That they not be afraid.
[00:20:03.264 --> 00:20:04.145]  Ha!
[00:20:04.165 --> 00:20:05.005]  Ha!
[00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:08.287]  Because that lion's gotta know, I'm tough, I'm gonna get you.
[00:20:08.307 --> 00:20:10.408]  And they corner him, then they stab him to death.
[00:20:11.204 --> 00:20:11.544]  Okay?
[00:20:11.885 --> 00:20:13.806]  Well, that's what all our ancestors did.
[00:20:14.006 --> 00:20:15.887]  That's why we extincted cave lions.
[00:20:16.368 --> 00:20:18.729]  That's why we extincted the big, mega cave bear.
[00:20:18.929 --> 00:20:22.112]  Humans hunted them out in Northern Europe and the Americas.
[00:20:23.172 --> 00:20:24.733]  Humans hunted out all the elephants.
[00:20:25.314 --> 00:20:28.076]  Because humans would get in that crazed mode.
[00:20:29.713 --> 00:20:31.774]  And, and, and, but, but actually meant it.
[00:20:32.454 --> 00:20:33.054]  You understand?
[00:20:33.074 --> 00:20:38.717]  And, you know, instead of being in the NFL, our top champion Warriors were taking on, you know, Cave Bears.
[00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:39.677]  You understand that, folks?
[00:20:40.177 --> 00:20:44.299]  And so, but, but, again, it's about who's got the momentum.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.581]  And so the elephants would see these people that weren't scared.
[00:20:47.881 --> 00:20:50.202]  Now, if you'd have walked out in front of one of the elephants and not acted...
[00:20:51.078 --> 00:20:51.878]  Aggressive and mean.
[00:20:52.278 --> 00:20:56.300]  They would have come over and run over and tried to stomp on you, knowing you were something dangerous.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.540]  And they do that.
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:58.800]  Just like a dog.
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.501]  A dog runs up on you and growls, even if it's one of the most vicious attack dogs.
[00:21:02.521 --> 00:21:04.982]  If you start going at it, it will go into defense mode.
[00:21:05.362 --> 00:21:08.303]  But no, the movies and culture tell you to run from a dog.
[00:21:09.343 --> 00:21:12.684]  You know, these movies never show a woman with a gun in her house when the killer comes.
[00:21:13.244 --> 00:21:15.025]  Again, it's all programming.
[00:21:15.225 --> 00:21:16.045]  And they admit this.
[00:21:16.065 --> 00:21:17.065]  We have government documents.
[00:21:17.105 --> 00:21:18.105]  We've covered them.
[00:21:18.866 --> 00:21:29.829]  So instead, you know, there's a group of a hundred Macedons or more in these big troops, you know, these big herds, and they see these people painted up with weird paint on them.
[00:21:30.769 --> 00:21:33.391]  And they start going, oh I don't like that.
[00:21:33.471 --> 00:21:38.775]  And then again, the humans start chasing them for hours, closing it in, driving them over the cliff.
[00:21:38.815 --> 00:21:45.961]  That's the SWAT teams, NORTHCOM, the military, are just a few people scaring us, the big, strong, massive humans.
[00:21:46.001 --> 00:21:51.165]  See, the elites say that they are engaging in predator activity against the general public.
[00:21:51.505 --> 00:21:53.527]  They say in the natural order that's their jobs.
[00:21:54.568 --> 00:21:55.508]  We're on the march.
[00:21:55.969 --> 00:21:57.490]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:58.468 --> 00:22:01.270]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:04.013 --> 00:22:09.017]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:22:09.217 --> 00:22:13.020]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:18.825]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:22:19.145 --> 00:22:19.586]  It's true.
[00:22:19.786 --> 00:22:24.734]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:30.583]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:22:31.425 --> 00:22:34.049]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:22:34.309 --> 00:22:37.690]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:04.750]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.812]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:23:07.012 --> 00:23:07.653]  Well, you should.
[00:23:07.673 --> 00:23:12.258]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:23:12.498 --> 00:23:12.978]  That's right.
[00:23:13.299 --> 00:23:21.767]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:23:21.967 --> 00:23:23.229]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:23:23.329 --> 00:23:24.470]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:30.292]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:23:30.653 --> 00:23:37.155]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:23:37.536 --> 00:23:42.718]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:23:43.058 --> 00:23:44.199]  This is real.
[00:23:44.519 --> 00:23:45.260]  Don't miss out.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:53.948]  Secure a Front Sight Defensive Handgun Course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.

[00:24:00.193 --> 00:24:03.116]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[00:24:04.164 --> 00:24:11.009]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[00:24:11.309 --> 00:24:27.261]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[00:24:27.521 --> 00:24:32.645]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[00:24:32.865 --> 00:24:39.150]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:43.033]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[00:24:43.273 --> 00:24:45.875]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[00:24:45.975 --> 00:24:51.419]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.282]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:24:54.342 --> 00:24:56.543]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[00:24:56.563 --> 00:24:59.005]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:24:59.065 --> 00:25:02.688]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose
[00:25:02.768 --> 00:25:31.878]  I hear the train a-comin' It's rollin' around the bend And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when I'm stuck in Folsom Prison And time keeps draggin' on But that train keeps a-rollin' On down to San Antonio
[00:25:33.581 --> 00:25:36.403]  Folks, it never ends around here.
[00:25:36.584 --> 00:25:41.287]  I've got to go off air right now.
[00:25:41.407 --> 00:25:46.492]  I have the FBI here at the office with the APD.
[00:25:46.512 --> 00:25:51.396]  So I need you guys to go to some type of rebroadcast here.
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.643]  Got the media attacking me on every front.
[00:26:00.683 --> 00:26:07.330]  God knows what new horror this is for us to try to sit here and warn you about what the New World Order is doing.
[00:26:07.791 --> 00:26:15.579]  I'll try to come back and tell you about the government policy book written by the White House science czar about how they want to kill the majority of us.
[00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:20.392]  There's another big article where he pushed for abortion and that babies aren't human.
[00:26:21.192 --> 00:26:22.873]  That's mainstream news.
[00:26:22.893 --> 00:26:24.374]  I'll be getting to later.
[00:26:24.434 --> 00:26:25.614]  I meant to get to all of this.
[00:26:25.955 --> 00:26:32.718]  We're going to play us some good rants from myself and I'll be back as soon as possible because they just told me during the break they're up there and I'm going to go talk to them.
[00:26:34.258 --> 00:26:42.523]  Commanders kiss the butt of all the little cops and then they all feed on each other and their hatred and disdain for the public, especially in Miami.
[00:26:42.543 --> 00:26:52.089]  It was a lot, I mean, a federal judge was out there at a previous event in Miami going to their car and the cops cornered him and beat him down and they lost a big suit over that because they didn't know.
[00:26:52.469 --> 00:27:00.194]  They thought they were going to have a little fun on a side street with a judge and went to, I mean, just beat the person almost to death and they got in a lot of trouble for that but that was because that was a
[00:27:00.774 --> 00:27:07.441]  That was a real citizen, a God-level person, you know, above them in the government, not a slave scum that's, you know, just here to be stomped on.
[00:27:07.721 --> 00:27:11.705]  And so that's why when I'm driving down the road and there's lanes on both sides of me, Austin Cop, no lights on, just run right up behind you with pleasure.
[00:27:11.725 --> 00:27:18.012]  Just, just, rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[00:27:18.092 --> 00:27:37.027]  And then you sit there with a light in your face going, you son of a bitch, citizen, you are slave, civilian, I rule you, and if I want to shoot you in the face with rubber bullets, you know that girl at the Red Sox game came out of a bar, they shot her in the face ten feet away, blew her eyeball back in her brain, she bled to death, the cops went on the news and said she shouldn't have been out there.
[00:27:37.688 --> 00:27:38.889]  Death, death, death.
[00:27:39.489 --> 00:27:40.149]  Hey, don't worry.
[00:27:40.169 --> 00:27:41.510]  The bankers are going to take everything.
[00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:42.371]  You got cops.
[00:27:42.811 --> 00:27:45.572]  You think you can just deal death on us and deal pain on us?
[00:27:45.772 --> 00:27:50.055]  You don't think there aren't bigger devils above you in the New World Order that'll have their way with you?
[00:27:50.295 --> 00:27:51.836]  You think you're safe from evil?
[00:27:52.196 --> 00:27:55.037]  We have liberty and freedom and we're... Look at that famous photo.
[00:27:55.978 --> 00:27:56.818]  That was in Oregon.
[00:27:57.579 --> 00:27:59.840]  That woman, they said no protest.
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:05.143]  She was peacefully with a sign and there's video of that on the web and they just start choking her until she passes out.
[00:28:06.127 --> 00:28:11.992]  Just men in black uniforms grabbing a 55-year-old woman, just choking her.
[00:28:12.293 --> 00:28:14.715]  You're going to learn who we are!
[00:28:14.735 --> 00:28:16.656]  You're going to learn to submit!
[00:28:16.857 --> 00:28:19.479]  The foreign bankers have given us unlimited power!
[00:28:19.499 --> 00:28:21.220]  And we're going to rule you!
[00:28:21.541 --> 00:28:22.882]  This is our country!
[00:28:23.843 --> 00:28:24.283]  You're here!
[00:28:24.323 --> 00:28:25.885]  We're going to feed on your ass!
[00:28:26.553 --> 00:28:28.214]  And the cops just drink fluoride water.
[00:28:28.414 --> 00:28:28.574]  Ugh.
[00:28:28.734 --> 00:28:30.735]  They take their kids and just shoot them up with mercury.
[00:28:30.755 --> 00:28:32.356]  And the kids become autistic.
[00:28:32.376 --> 00:28:33.217]  The cops don't care.
[00:28:33.517 --> 00:28:34.978]  They're like, I'm going to the Tet Bar.
[00:28:34.998 --> 00:28:36.999]  I don't care if my kid's brain damaged.
[00:28:37.219 --> 00:28:40.441]  And they drink whiskey and wreck and kill everybody in Austin.
[00:28:40.681 --> 00:28:46.284]  And then when they wreck and kill themselves, the cops then go and SWAT team the bar owners that sold them too much whiskey.
[00:28:46.464 --> 00:28:49.445]  It's your fault you sold too much whiskey to a god!
[00:28:49.966 --> 00:28:52.287]  You don't sell too much whiskey to a god!
[00:28:52.507 --> 00:28:53.508]  We're God!
[00:28:53.708 --> 00:28:54.488]  You understand?
[00:28:54.528 --> 00:28:55.709]  We rule America!
[00:28:56.604 --> 00:29:00.566]  We'll shoot you in the face, we'll bloody your face, and we'll laugh about it!
[00:29:01.346 --> 00:29:03.107]  Because we're weak gang members.
[00:29:03.728 --> 00:29:04.468]  You look at those men.
[00:29:05.328 --> 00:29:06.809]  Go back to the video of the cops laughing.
[00:29:06.829 --> 00:29:07.930]  Look how soft they are.
[00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:10.651]  Look how their eyes don't have any electric liberty in them.
[00:29:11.251 --> 00:29:12.512]  Look at how soft they are.
[00:29:13.192 --> 00:29:14.553]  Look at how disgusting they are.
[00:29:14.573 --> 00:29:18.155]  And you can see a few of the cops in there are looking like they're not having fun.
[00:29:18.175 --> 00:29:20.616]  And if you look at their faces, they look human.
[00:29:21.236 --> 00:29:22.597]  They look like they still have a soul.
[00:29:23.197 --> 00:29:24.378]  Back it up to them laughing.
[00:29:30.933 --> 00:29:33.715]  Now her case is back in the news because of this.
[00:29:33.735 --> 00:29:38.937]  The good news about being able to watch you guys live on TV is that lady with the red dress.
[00:29:41.859 --> 00:29:49.443]  A police video shot after the shooting incident just released following a review of excessive force complaints at the protest.
[00:29:50.383 --> 00:29:50.884]  Hit pause.
[00:29:50.964 --> 00:29:51.564]  Hit pause.
[00:29:51.584 --> 00:29:52.825]  That one's soft right there.
[00:29:53.953 --> 00:29:59.481]  That guy joined the force because I guarantee you he's the type of guy that bullied kids that were smaller than him.
[00:29:59.861 --> 00:30:01.583]  Then those kids grew up and kicked his ass.
[00:30:02.925 --> 00:30:03.686]  I know those types.
[00:30:03.726 --> 00:30:04.648]  I've seen that face.
[00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:07.471]  And now they love it.
[00:30:07.492 --> 00:30:10.496]  They can abuse and beat up everybody and nobody can stop them.
[00:30:11.331 --> 00:30:12.292]  Nobody can stop them.
[00:30:12.312 --> 00:30:13.933]  They're having their way with America!
[00:30:14.613 --> 00:30:15.734]  They want our guns!
[00:30:16.234 --> 00:30:20.817]  And if you're not with them, cops and military, ah, then you will declare that you're with the Republic now!
[00:30:21.057 --> 00:30:26.720]  And don't tell me that I'm a weirdo because I'm upset about this, and I should only go get upset about my favorite football team winning or losing.
[00:30:27.161 --> 00:30:28.722]  Listen, I know what tyranny means.
[00:30:28.802 --> 00:30:30.923]  I know the bankers are putting poison in our food and water.
[00:30:31.323 --> 00:30:33.364]  I know the bankers have stolen 8.5 trillion.
[00:30:33.604 --> 00:30:35.104]  I know we're under War Powers Act.
[00:30:35.384 --> 00:30:36.384]  I know they're hurting us.
[00:30:36.624 --> 00:30:38.145]  I know they're carrying out New World Order.
[00:30:38.365 --> 00:30:40.245]  I know they staged those terror attacks.
[00:30:40.485 --> 00:30:49.447]  You know what it's like to gut up to this and go out every day and go past the peer pressure and come out day one and say 9-11 was an inside job and lose most of the radio stations I was on?
[00:30:49.627 --> 00:30:55.849]  You know what it's like to go to sleep every night knowing you work for a bunch of psychotic killers and you bastards are probably going to end up killing me one day?
[00:30:56.009 --> 00:30:57.929]  You know what it's like knowing you've ruined my life?
[00:30:58.129 --> 00:31:00.150]  You know what it's like, you sons of bitches?
[00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:01.871]  I'm tired of your crap!
[00:31:02.471 --> 00:31:06.894]  You commit evil, you're part of an evil system, and we're standing up against you!
[00:31:07.215 --> 00:31:09.536]  And the Republic is going to defeat you in the end!
[00:31:10.036 --> 00:31:13.319]  Some of us won't make it personally through this, but a lot of us are!
[00:31:13.579 --> 00:31:25.827]  And in the end, you are going to be brought to justice for all the kids you've kidnapped for CPS, all you CPS workers, all you corrupt bureaucrats, all you that have had your way with innocent children over and over again, who think your evil's invincible.
[00:31:26.047 --> 00:31:28.749]  You're not invincible, and God is going to deal with you!
[00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:30.330]  And you are cursed!
[00:31:33.991 --> 00:31:34.312]  I'm done.
[00:31:34.332 --> 00:31:35.032]  I gotta get out of here.
[00:31:35.092 --> 00:31:35.872]  I'm pissed off now.
[00:31:35.952 --> 00:31:37.693]  Robert Wannick, you can make some closing comments.
[00:31:37.713 --> 00:31:39.034]  I'll give you the last two minutes.
[00:31:39.394 --> 00:31:40.434]  We're gonna end transmission.
[00:31:41.054 --> 00:31:42.355]  Make sure the guy's got your address.
[00:31:42.375 --> 00:31:43.415]  I can send you those videos.
[00:31:43.435 --> 00:31:44.356]  You can resist tyranny.
[00:31:44.656 --> 00:31:45.296]  I salute ya.
[00:31:47.157 --> 00:31:50.338]  You know, they don't, these police, they don't know that they're prompting the New World Order.
[00:31:50.598 --> 00:31:52.099]  They think they are the highest up.
[00:31:52.399 --> 00:31:53.379]  And that's why they bully.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.540]  That's why they bully us.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:55.740]  But they don't understand.
[00:31:56.141 --> 00:31:57.081]  They are no better than us.
[00:31:57.799 --> 00:32:00.284]  The government thinks they are slaves, just like us.
[00:32:00.744 --> 00:32:02.768]  They are dirt to the government, just like we are.
[00:32:02.868 --> 00:32:06.394]  And they either fight with us, or we're gonna have to fight them.
[00:32:07.537 --> 00:32:10.760]  So, visit us over at nwoalert.com.
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.002]  That's nwoalert.com.

[00:32:15.525 --> 00:32:29.558]  Send us your files of activism in the public, and we will post them, and we're going to fight this brainwashing indoctrination system, and we're going to use information warfare with sites like InfoWars, and we're not going to let these police oppress us, and we're not going to let ourselves be abused.
[00:32:29.858 --> 00:32:40.626]  Psychologically and physically by the system and we're going to keep them running scared and we're going to bring sovereignty back and the USA is going to be what it was and what the founding fathers envisioned.
[00:32:43.968 --> 00:32:49.813]  I'm going to need to get the number for those DVDs and stickers and that's all I have to say.
[00:32:57.458 --> 00:32:58.299]  But if your student
[00:32:59.201 --> 00:33:04.805]  I really strongly urge you to send me pics, videos, anything you can get.
[00:33:04.945 --> 00:33:09.128]  Hidden camera audio of you being oppressed at your school.
[00:33:09.188 --> 00:33:13.491]  You're going to need to send them to 911bloggeratlive.com.
[00:33:14.011 --> 00:33:16.393]  You're going to need to visit nwoalert.com.
[00:33:16.933 --> 00:33:20.115]  And we're going to get, we're going to get you out in the spotlight.
[00:33:20.135 --> 00:33:21.476]  We're going to get you on YouTube.
[00:33:21.952 --> 00:33:23.073]  And we're gonna expose your school.
[00:33:23.334 --> 00:33:24.735]  Send us the full name of your school.
[00:33:25.236 --> 00:33:26.397]  High school, college, whatever.
[00:33:26.437 --> 00:33:27.678]  And send us your first and last name.
[00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:29.100]  We'll put you in the video.
[00:33:29.681 --> 00:33:30.942]  And we'll give out copies for free.
[00:33:30.982 --> 00:33:32.744]  I don't care how much it costs to burn the DVDs.
[00:33:32.764 --> 00:33:34.706]  We're gonna give you copies for free.
[00:33:40.376 --> 00:33:49.282]  Introduced at the request of Richard Danes, the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health, calls for changes to the law in order to make recommended inoculation.
[00:33:49.302 --> 00:33:53.585]  Because see, the hoax, it's now been exposed that it was a hoax, and that was getting them about 95%.
[00:33:53.885 --> 00:33:55.787]  But now the hoax is over!
[00:33:55.927 --> 00:33:57.448]  The criminal's hoax is over!
[00:33:57.728 --> 00:33:58.228]  SEE!
[00:33:58.408 --> 00:33:59.529]  THERE'S NO LAW!
[00:33:59.569 --> 00:34:00.690]  THEY'RE CRIMINALS!
[00:34:02.191 --> 00:34:02.911]  What does it take?
[00:34:02.931 --> 00:34:06.134]  A government that lies all the time to you,
[00:34:10.441 --> 00:34:12.566]  I care about you, you idiot police!
[00:34:13.508 --> 00:34:14.931]  You idiot school teachers!
[00:34:15.211 --> 00:34:16.534]  You idiot Americans!
[00:34:16.935 --> 00:34:18.478]  Stop being idiots!
[00:34:18.999 --> 00:34:19.761]  STOP IT!
[00:34:22.938 --> 00:34:25.379]  I've had hundreds of guests and scientists and doctors on.
[00:34:25.439 --> 00:34:26.939]  I've read all the source documents.
[00:34:26.999 --> 00:34:34.282]  I've played clips of the father of the polio vaccine, admitting it had cancer viruses in it and more, and AIDS, HIV.
[00:34:35.042 --> 00:34:35.742]  I've proven it.
[00:34:35.802 --> 00:34:36.942]  They're killing you, dude.
[00:34:37.042 --> 00:34:38.583]  Why do you want to die?
[00:34:39.043 --> 00:34:40.784]  Why do you want to believe their lies?
[00:34:41.104 --> 00:34:42.464]  What is your problem?
[00:34:46.165 --> 00:34:48.346]  What is your major malfunction?
[00:34:51.809 --> 00:34:57.295]  You want to thank God for me up here warning you that I've still got my head screwed on straight and I'm angry and upset.
[00:35:00.278 --> 00:35:02.300]  Folks, I have got as much instinct as a cow.
[00:35:03.615 --> 00:35:07.259]  Humans just have the best instincts, the smartest, the most cunning, the best sixth sense.
[00:35:07.279 --> 00:35:08.300]  You've had it bred out of you.
[00:35:08.901 --> 00:35:09.662]  Engineered out of you.
[00:35:09.682 --> 00:35:10.443]  Poisoned out of you.
[00:35:11.184 --> 00:35:21.415]  You get a bunch of cows at the slaughterhouse, and that's why they get them in tiny squeeze chutes, and then only bring them into the main slaughter area one at a time in most plants, and they usually got an air gun.
[00:35:22.216 --> 00:35:22.876]  We're good to go.
[00:35:45.458 --> 00:35:56.522]  They got one cow up hanging by its legs in front of you, blood pouring out its neck, and huge pools, and you're just snickering, telling me that isn't one of our fellow cows getting their throats slit right in front of us, you idiots!
[00:36:00.383 --> 00:36:01.504]  God, I can't do it anymore.
[00:36:02.124 --> 00:36:02.624]  I can't.
[00:36:02.884 --> 00:36:03.724]  I want out of here.
[00:36:04.125 --> 00:36:06.625]  I want to go to some happy, friendly country where this isn't going on.
[00:36:07.046 --> 00:36:08.706]  There's evil going on all around you!
[00:36:08.826 --> 00:36:10.607]  They're feeding on your neighbors down the street!
[00:36:13.561 --> 00:36:16.567]  But you don't know your neighbors anymore, so you're not aware of what's happening.
[00:36:21.237 --> 00:36:24.062]  I get so mad reading this article, I just can't control myself.
[00:36:25.684 --> 00:36:26.044]  Jesus.
[00:36:27.065 --> 00:36:34.389]  Assembly Bill 10942 introduced at the... We're only a few years away from cops coming to your house and SWAT teaming you if you don't shoot your kids up.
[00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:37.731]  And I'm just telling the cops right now, you're pushing and pushing.
[00:36:37.751 --> 00:36:39.933]  The globalists know people are going to fight back.
[00:36:39.973 --> 00:36:41.954]  Then they're going to say, see, there is homegrown terrorism.
[00:36:42.554 --> 00:36:45.076]  And then you're going to all get your butts kicked and they're going to bring in foreign troops.
[00:36:46.323 --> 00:36:47.764]  I understand you pushed far enough.
[00:36:47.824 --> 00:36:50.047]  You slimeball, think you're tough punks.
[00:36:51.288 --> 00:37:04.381]  Assembly Bill 10942, introduced at the request of Richard Danes, the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health, calls for changes to the law in order to make recommended inoculation compulsory in order for children to attend school.
[00:37:05.885 --> 00:37:11.767]  The bill would also permit the administration of vaccines for sexually transmitted infections to minors without parental consent.
[00:37:11.787 --> 00:37:13.628]  Now that is huge.
[00:37:13.648 --> 00:37:15.928]  They're already taking your kids for abortions without your consent.
[00:37:16.569 --> 00:37:23.491]  Your 12 or 13 year olds, in some cases as young as 10, they gotta have a letter to go to the zoo with the government training camp.
[00:37:25.077 --> 00:37:26.619]  It's hot to have a baby ripped out of them.
[00:37:26.819 --> 00:37:27.520]  But you don't care.
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.842]  It's all part of being scum.
[00:37:29.283 --> 00:37:39.016]  You let the scum, filth, degenerate, viperous, murdering, trash, commie government just have its way with your kids while they train them to tat along you and everything else.
[00:37:40.177 --> 00:37:50.440]  And you've got all your instincts sucked out of you, where you think a bunch of vampiric scumbag government leering over your children, the state stating in California's Supreme Court that the state owns your children.
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.601]  Remember that?
[00:37:52.621 --> 00:37:55.242]  And that homeschooling's illegal in California.
[00:37:55.402 --> 00:37:56.282]  You're out of control!
[00:37:56.302 --> 00:37:57.723]  The government's dirtbag!
[00:38:04.181 --> 00:38:10.085]  The bill would also permit the administration of vaccines for sexually transmitted infections to minors without parental consent.
[00:38:10.626 --> 00:38:21.433]  Merck, when they're not killing you with their Vioxx, they've got their Gardasil, which admittedly has killed a whole bunch of people and causes horrible autoimmune things that look like Ebola with blood pouring out of every orifice.
[00:38:21.473 --> 00:38:21.954]  Go read it.
[00:38:22.754 --> 00:38:23.375]  Had women on it.
[00:38:23.395 --> 00:38:24.756]  It's almost killed on this show.
[00:38:26.292 --> 00:38:28.253]  And, uh, it's been in the news it's killed a bunch.
[00:38:28.593 --> 00:38:35.595]  And then they say on the insert, go look it up on their own website, says it doesn't protect you from cancer, doesn't protect you from this type of virus.
[00:38:35.795 --> 00:38:38.456]  We think it might protect you from a few strains of 350.
[00:38:38.596 --> 00:38:40.236]  It might cover four to six.
[00:38:41.016 --> 00:38:42.357]  But if you already have the virus...
[00:38:43.377 --> 00:38:46.760]  Which around half the population has, of men and women.
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.882]  Then it gives you a 45% increase in cancer.
[00:38:49.922 --> 00:38:53.304]  Oh, they know it gives you cancer, but you're too stupid.
[00:38:53.524 --> 00:39:02.671]  You think the government gives you sweet milk, and you sit there suckling off of its snake breast, when you don't understand it's PURE DEATH!
[00:39:05.133 --> 00:39:10.516]  I have to watch my fellow humans march into the death camps in front of me!
[00:39:11.533 --> 00:39:16.618]  That it's all done in an orderly fashion of ignorance and moronicness.
[00:39:16.638 --> 00:39:20.562]  Do you hear all the scientists and guests and new old order people I have on who I tear apart?
[00:39:21.263 --> 00:39:22.424]  And it's not because I'm smart.
[00:39:22.524 --> 00:39:23.465]  I understand the system.
[00:39:23.525 --> 00:39:24.086]  I study it.
[00:39:24.246 --> 00:39:24.926]  It's what I do.
[00:39:25.067 --> 00:39:26.748]  I know what I'm talking about.
[00:39:26.948 --> 00:39:30.112]  I've told you the truth and nothing but the truth!
[00:39:30.552 --> 00:39:31.913]  And this is why I want to reach people.
[00:39:31.953 --> 00:39:33.555]  This is why I want to get out to more people.
[00:39:33.615 --> 00:39:45.386]  This is why I want to bust my butt and build a studio and do it myself and tape a TV show and try to get it on five nights a week on Dish Network because then we can hype it and get big listenership and have street teams out getting the word out.
[00:39:46.387 --> 00:39:48.649]  My God, if it was all paid for, I'd have no commercials on it.
[00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:51.031]  As it is, it'll probably have commercials.
[00:39:51.131 --> 00:39:52.372]  I mean, I need your help, man.
[00:39:52.732 --> 00:39:53.633]  I just want to warn people.
[00:39:53.773 --> 00:39:53.974]  Listen.
[00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:56.751]  You go warn people about how this stuff's killing them.
[00:39:56.771 --> 00:39:57.512]  You write articles.
[00:39:57.552 --> 00:39:58.372]  You go out and tell them.
[00:39:58.592 --> 00:39:59.693]  I just want to tell people!
[00:39:59.893 --> 00:40:01.054]  I just want to reach people!
[00:40:01.074 --> 00:40:09.119]  Because it's going to get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[00:40:09.199 --> 00:40:10.500]  It isn't going to stop.
[00:40:11.281 --> 00:40:13.362]  They do everything they said they were going to do.
[00:40:15.023 --> 00:40:15.863]  Right down the line.
[00:40:16.684 --> 00:40:17.484]  They say they're going to do this.
[00:40:17.504 --> 00:40:17.845]  They do it.
[00:40:18.125 --> 00:40:18.905]  They say they're going to do that.
[00:40:18.965 --> 00:40:21.927]  And they've said... So I've seen their whole battle plan.
[00:40:21.947 --> 00:40:22.948]  They admit what they're going to do.
[00:40:24.252 --> 00:40:32.978]  And up here it's killing eighty to ninety percent of us, flying over, spraying us in the end, killing us in mass, activating cancer systems they put in us, all this stuff.
[00:40:33.138 --> 00:40:36.701]  And they're already up to here and I'm like, my God, they keep doing everything they say they're going to do!
[00:40:37.021 --> 00:40:38.182]  My God, they're really going to do it!
[00:40:38.242 --> 00:40:38.783]  My God!
[00:40:39.023 --> 00:40:39.523]  My God!
[00:40:39.583 --> 00:40:40.444]  WARN PEOPLE!
[00:40:46.388 --> 00:40:47.169]  And they're evil!
[00:40:47.209 --> 00:40:48.049]  They're so evil!
[00:40:48.289 --> 00:40:51.232]  And I just wish good people would wake up and fight back against this!
[00:40:54.994 --> 00:40:57.136]  I was screaming so loud earlier I tore something up my throat.
[00:40:57.496 --> 00:40:58.657]  I was coughing up blood earlier.
[00:41:00.599 --> 00:41:02.440]  It's because my soul is torn apart.
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:03.821]  I am just so angry.
[00:41:03.921 --> 00:41:05.342]  I don't have the strength or the will.
[00:41:05.743 --> 00:41:07.204]  I'm trying to push a rock up a hill.
[00:41:07.304 --> 00:41:08.005]  I need your help.
[00:41:08.125 --> 00:41:09.666]  I just want to warn people.
[00:41:09.686 --> 00:41:11.988]  I just want to arrest all these people that have done this.
[00:41:13.009 --> 00:41:14.870]  It's their own documents, their own treason.
[00:41:15.391 --> 00:41:18.974]  They all write books about how they're going to enslave us and how it's funny and how we're dumb.
[00:41:19.534 --> 00:41:22.657]  And you just sit there laughing at me while they're laughing at you!
[00:41:27.867 --> 00:41:28.567]  I want to get them!
[00:41:31.729 --> 00:41:33.531]  I want to get people that want to get me.
[00:41:36.813 --> 00:41:42.036]  I don't go around looking for fights, but I sure as hell will stand up against somebody that starts one with me.
[00:41:42.937 --> 00:41:44.237]  And I've tried to get away from it.
[00:41:44.257 --> 00:41:45.218]  I've tried to run away.
[00:41:45.498 --> 00:41:47.199]  I've tried to tell myself it's going to be alright.
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:51.142]  I've tried to tell myself we're going to win and it's going to be okay, but not unless we put out a full effort.
[00:41:52.887 --> 00:41:53.987]  I've tried to avoid this.
[00:41:54.027 --> 00:41:55.127]  I've tried to deny this.
[00:41:55.147 --> 00:41:57.808]  This is something you can't run away from this.
[00:41:58.328 --> 00:41:59.568]  You don't have a choice.
[00:41:59.768 --> 00:42:01.109]  They're not going to stop coming.
[00:42:01.309 --> 00:42:02.649]  They're not going to stop pushing.
[00:42:03.029 --> 00:42:03.929]  They're organized.
[00:42:03.949 --> 00:42:04.689]  They're focused.
[00:42:04.709 --> 00:42:06.510]  They're coming to kill you.
[00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:09.990]  From the bottom of my heart, go research the facts.
[00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:11.531]  Research it all.
[00:42:14.891 --> 00:42:18.232]  The bill would also permit the administration of vaccines for sexually transmitted infections
[00:42:21.789 --> 00:42:23.911]  To minors without parental consent.
[00:42:23.971 --> 00:42:25.633]  God, that's the state becoming the parents.
[00:42:26.193 --> 00:42:30.258]  Separate sessions of the bill will also come into effect next year, with others becoming law in 2010.
[00:42:30.298 --> 00:42:32.940]  So there you have it.
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.423]  No more do you control your children or do they control it.
[00:42:35.463 --> 00:42:38.266]  The state, under the new eugenic social system, controls you.
[00:42:40.948 --> 00:43:02.352]  ACHAMP, a national non-partisan political action organization formed by parents to support of children with neurodevelopmental and communication disorders, has called for rejection of the bill and is demanding the passage of A5468-S3031 in the Senate, a bill that would give individuals a right to a philosophical exemption.
[00:43:02.992 --> 00:43:05.132]  They don't have to give us, see, we already have the right.
[00:43:05.152 --> 00:43:06.873]  They're now claiming we don't have that right.
[00:43:07.173 --> 00:43:09.433]  A new world order in the near future.
[00:43:10.749 --> 00:43:13.170]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:15.571]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:43:16.631 --> 00:43:18.852]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:43:19.413 --> 00:43:21.874]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:43:22.614 --> 00:43:29.917]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:43:32.967 --> 00:43:37.910]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:43:38.391 --> 00:43:41.853]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:43:42.273 --> 00:43:44.735]  Bill of Rights is making great progress for the world government.
[00:43:44.835 --> 00:43:45.976]  Most people have no idea.
[00:43:45.996 --> 00:43:46.776]  They're not after money.
[00:43:46.796 --> 00:43:47.857]  They have all the money they need.
[00:43:48.077 --> 00:43:48.778]  They're after power.
[00:43:49.038 --> 00:43:50.078]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:44:01.726 --> 00:44:02.767]  You have been warned.
[00:44:03.888 --> 00:44:10.893]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards, and licenses?
[00:44:11.133 --> 00:44:14.775]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[00:44:15.075 --> 00:44:23.161]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[00:44:23.401 --> 00:44:26.103]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[00:44:26.303 --> 00:44:28.785]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[00:44:29.065 --> 00:44:33.307]  Thieves get near you, push a button, and these tiny radios give out personal information.
[00:44:33.508 --> 00:44:34.928]  Put a stop to identity theft.
[00:44:35.168 --> 00:44:37.049]  Visit IDStronghold.com.

[00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:57.081]  Or call 1-800-610-2770.
[00:44:57.101 --> 00:44:57.361]  1-800-610-2770 today.
[00:44:57.382 --> 00:44:57.582]  You worry.
[00:44:57.602 --> 00:44:59.745]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[00:44:59.765 --> 00:44:59.805]  Hi.
[00:44:59.825 --> 00:45:02.048]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[00:45:11.812 --> 00:45:12.312]  We're good to go.
[00:45:41.732 --> 00:45:42.272]  We're good to go.
[00:46:09.452 --> 00:46:11.994]  Yeah, it's actually big news in England.
[00:46:12.174 --> 00:46:13.014]  It's happened to me there.
[00:46:13.354 --> 00:46:15.155]  You're just walking along videotaping stuff.
[00:46:15.175 --> 00:46:17.457]  Cops walk over and they're gonna put you in a terror database.
[00:46:17.877 --> 00:46:19.338]  Not allowed to talk to people on the street.
[00:46:20.018 --> 00:46:22.459]  And they grab mainstream news cameras now.
[00:46:22.479 --> 00:46:26.021]  See, the government's gonna surveil you, the slave.
[00:46:27.402 --> 00:46:30.984]  But you're not gonna point a camera anywhere near them.
[00:46:31.564 --> 00:46:38.008]  You're gonna learn that when the government says jump, you say, yes, master, how high.
[00:46:39.722 --> 00:46:42.644]  You're here to serve government and be a slave.
[00:46:43.105 --> 00:46:45.426]  You're here to work and pay taxes.
[00:46:45.847 --> 00:46:46.367]  Scum!
[00:46:47.168 --> 00:46:49.189]  Shut up and learn to be a slave.
[00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:51.711]  Learn to be a schmuck, okay?
[00:46:52.091 --> 00:46:53.492]  Don't listen to people like me.
[00:46:53.632 --> 00:46:54.173]  I'm bad.
[00:46:54.833 --> 00:46:55.814]  I'm not patriotic.
[00:46:55.854 --> 00:47:00.037]  Patriotic means be a slave, worship criminal government, okay?
[00:47:00.757 --> 00:47:01.178]  I'm bad.
[00:47:01.578 --> 00:47:02.098]  I don't like it.
[00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:03.259]  But you are good.
[00:47:03.339 --> 00:47:04.260]  You've got it all figured out.
[00:47:05.266 --> 00:47:08.489]  The media says the gas is up because of speculation.
[00:47:08.549 --> 00:47:09.490]  It's true, it doesn't matter.
[00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:12.552]  You're supposed to parrot that like a little parrot.
[00:47:12.993 --> 00:47:14.214]  Like a cockatoo.
[00:47:15.491 --> 00:47:26.460]  You could admit it was the dollar devaluation by the Federal Reserve and politically force them to stop it and save your future, but you're not going to, because you're members of the establishment.
[00:47:26.921 --> 00:47:37.409]  You don't listen to conspiracy theorists when they read to you directly from press releases by OPEC begging the government to stop devaluing the dollar, because it's destroying the world economy.
[00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:38.230]  No, no, no, no.
[00:47:39.477 --> 00:47:43.560]  Let's go ahead and go to someone who tried to go out with a Tyranny Response Team shirt.
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:45.562]  We have those at InfoWars.com.
[00:47:45.862 --> 00:47:46.683]  I imagine you got it from us.
[00:47:46.783 --> 00:47:47.263]  Great listener.
[00:47:47.623 --> 00:47:51.566]  And he had his First Amendment rights violated in this third world cesspit.
[00:47:52.227 --> 00:47:53.668]  Go ahead, Alex, and floor to finish up.
[00:47:54.270 --> 00:48:01.135]  Yes, so as I'm walking away, they grabbed my arm and twisted behind me, and somehow I'm able to get my camera, which was running the entire time, in my pocket.
[00:48:01.175 --> 00:48:06.518]  So everything that I'm about to tell you, I've got... And let me guess, after they assaulted you, they charged you with assault?
[00:48:06.979 --> 00:48:09.240]  Um, actually, my only charge was resisting arrest.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.582]  Oh my God, this is unprecedented, huh?
[00:48:11.642 --> 00:48:11.922]  Okay.
[00:48:12.042 --> 00:48:14.484]  And my charge was actually dropped 24 hours later.
[00:48:14.504 --> 00:48:15.644]  I never even saw a judge.
[00:48:15.664 --> 00:48:17.546]  Well, that's because they know there were other camera shots of it.
[00:48:17.566 --> 00:48:18.466]  Were there other people's cameras?
[00:48:18.526 --> 00:48:19.007]  Oh, yes, yes.
[00:48:19.047 --> 00:48:20.007]  Well, that's only why.
[00:48:20.147 --> 00:48:23.710]  You see, they would have probably gone ahead and tasered you till you had a heart attack,
[00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:25.311]  I don't know, man.
[00:48:25.331 --> 00:48:26.491]  I was actually... Yeah, I know.
[00:48:26.571 --> 00:48:26.772]  And they...
[00:48:47.134 --> 00:48:50.678]  Oh, and then they actually tried to delete the footage once I was in... Good!
[00:48:50.698 --> 00:48:52.159]  That's what slaves deserve!
[00:48:52.259 --> 00:48:55.422]  They didn't count on the fact that... Campering with evidence is good!
[00:48:56.043 --> 00:49:00.447]  They didn't count on the fact that we're a bunch of computer people... DESTROYING EVIDENCE IS GOOD!
[00:49:00.868 --> 00:49:03.931]  KILLING AMERICA IS GOOD!
[00:49:05.749 --> 00:49:07.850]  See, they're cancer cells racing through.
[00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:08.791]  They think they're winning.
[00:49:08.991 --> 00:49:09.731]  They think they're winning.
[00:49:09.751 --> 00:49:10.772]  They're really killing the body.
[00:49:10.932 --> 00:49:12.012]  They're really killing the country.
[00:49:12.132 --> 00:49:13.773]  But it feels good to be cancer!
[00:49:13.993 --> 00:49:15.754]  It feels good to kill America!
[00:49:16.154 --> 00:49:17.635]  And don't worry, you're gonna win!
[00:49:17.815 --> 00:49:18.955]  Don't worry, scum!
[00:49:18.975 --> 00:49:19.916]  New world order!
[00:49:19.936 --> 00:49:20.796]  You're winning!
[00:49:20.836 --> 00:49:22.377]  You're destroying it all!
[00:49:22.917 --> 00:49:23.838]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[00:49:23.858 --> 00:49:31.461]  That's what they're trying to do, but we actually modeled our news organization based on the work that you're doing and that we at Change is doing.
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:36.603]  And we've actually distributed over a thousand copies of your movies on Endgame, 9-11, New York City, and New Martial Law.
[00:49:37.043 --> 00:49:40.865]  We're actually trying to be the satellite in South Florida for the work you guys are doing.
[00:49:40.885 --> 00:49:42.446]  We've actually hooked up with Florida Change.
[00:49:43.107 --> 00:49:46.228]  And we're actually... How dare you criminals!
[00:49:46.328 --> 00:49:47.629]  Engage in the First Amendment!
[00:49:47.789 --> 00:49:49.790]  That's hot treason against the New World Order!
[00:49:50.711 --> 00:49:51.591]  Give us any websites.
[00:49:51.651 --> 00:49:54.113]  I don't know where you see your photos and video.
[00:49:54.213 --> 00:49:54.953]  Sure.
[00:49:55.113 --> 00:49:56.334]  Federaljack.com.
[00:49:56.374 --> 00:49:57.835]  That's the news website.
[00:49:57.875 --> 00:49:58.956]  Federaljack?
[00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:01.057]  Oh, that sounds like a... So it's about the God?
[00:50:01.491 --> 00:50:04.032]  Yes, the federal government hijacked the system.
[00:50:04.092 --> 00:50:06.794]  Can I go worship the men in black uniforms at that site?
[00:50:07.194 --> 00:50:10.215]  Oh, there's plenty of photos and stuff like that.
[00:50:10.255 --> 00:50:12.296]  Federaljack.com?
[00:50:12.677 --> 00:50:15.158]  Maybe you'll be allowed to be a boot licker.
[00:50:15.178 --> 00:50:20.821]  Like, on every corner, they'll just walk over and have a slave in a chain who will lick their boots.
[00:50:20.841 --> 00:50:21.801]  That's how they'll polish them.
[00:50:22.181 --> 00:50:23.722]  I think that's how the country ought to run.
[00:50:24.402 --> 00:50:25.903]  Yeah, that sounds about like South Florida.
[00:50:25.923 --> 00:50:28.505]  Last week, we actually tried to get him to the U.S.
[00:50:28.545 --> 00:50:29.205]  Mayor's Conference
[00:50:29.747 --> 00:50:31.929]  We've got a story up there about that, and a Post Inc.
[00:50:31.949 --> 00:50:32.689]  reporter was arrested.
[00:50:32.709 --> 00:50:33.470]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:34.851]  Hey, Trey, my producer's in there.
[00:50:34.871 --> 00:50:35.972]  He bored us on the Sunday Show.
[00:50:36.332 --> 00:50:39.174]  I want you to find, uh, check out his website.
[00:50:39.214 --> 00:50:39.975]  I'm sure it's good stuff.
[00:50:40.015 --> 00:50:40.815]  Let's have this guy on.
[00:50:40.875 --> 00:50:41.896]  What's your name, Alex?
[00:50:41.916 --> 00:50:42.917]  My name's Alex.
[00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:46.960]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.823]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:55.650]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:55.770 --> 00:51:00.392]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:51:00.492 --> 00:51:03.252]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:51:03.452 --> 00:51:06.293]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:06.493 --> 00:51:12.395]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:51:12.595 --> 00:51:15.515]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:15.815 --> 00:51:18.316]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift store
[00:51:18.396 --> 00:51:18.957]  We're good to go.
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:48.703]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:51:48.843 --> 00:51:49.843]  Take action today.
[00:51:49.863 --> 00:51:51.824]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:56.927 --> 00:51:58.848]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:59.289 --> 00:52:02.230]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:08.574 --> 00:52:09.254]  Big Brother.
[00:52:09.874 --> 00:52:10.815]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:11.611 --> 00:52:12.712]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:13.373 --> 00:52:14.194]  You want answers?
[00:52:14.954 --> 00:52:15.815]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:16.516 --> 00:52:20.119]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:24.803]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:27.446 --> 00:52:34.512]  They're about to pass bills to regulate and tax and do home inspections and tax all carbon.
[00:52:36.234 --> 00:52:37.115]  It's been all over the news.
[00:52:40.776 --> 00:52:41.798]  It's Washington Post.
[00:52:42.939 --> 00:52:43.601]  Man detained.
[00:52:45.464 --> 00:52:46.325]  Oh, now I'm going crazy.
[00:52:46.345 --> 00:52:47.587]  Let me think of the exact headline.
[00:52:49.049 --> 00:52:49.931]  Exact headline.
[00:52:56.467 --> 00:52:59.869]  It is now illegal to take photos of buildings in D.C.
[00:53:00.089 --> 00:53:00.870]  But there's no law!
[00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:02.110]  But they have weapons!
[00:53:02.551 --> 00:53:07.033]  And it's their country and they're going to ship the coke and heroin in and your kids are going to use it and go to their own prisons.
[00:53:07.214 --> 00:53:09.175]  And they're going to make your kids take Ritalin and Prozac.
[00:53:09.355 --> 00:53:11.116]  And they're going to take your guns and they're going to hurt you.
[00:53:11.156 --> 00:53:16.559]  And they've got a lot of stupid goons who like to push people around who aren't real warriors who like to pick on innocent people.
[00:53:16.759 --> 00:53:19.061]  And they enjoy just destroying the Republic.
[00:53:19.101 --> 00:53:21.843]  Just fill... Yes, there it is, there it is, Washington Post.
[00:53:22.163 --> 00:53:23.744]  Secret buildings you may not photograph.
[00:53:25.165 --> 00:53:26.805]  There's the Washington Post right there.
[00:53:27.505 --> 00:53:29.286]  Secret buildings you may not photograph.
[00:53:30.546 --> 00:53:31.006]  DARPA.
[00:53:33.287 --> 00:53:44.949]  I am sick of you criminal filth trying to domesticate us and intimidate us and set the precedent that we're your slaves so your offshore banker masters can suck us dry!
[00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:46.829]  Stop being traitors!
[00:53:47.169 --> 00:53:49.070]  Stop destroying the United States!
[00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:51.090]  Stop claiming you're patriots!
[00:53:58.297 --> 00:54:06.203]  I just see stuff like this and it makes me mad and I'm already wound up over the Federal Reserve Dictatorship and saying Congress has no authority over the coining and issuance of currency and money.
[00:54:09.025 --> 00:54:12.288]  I go to events and they have the Army watching us and it's now in the news.
[00:54:12.528 --> 00:54:13.929]  The Army follows us around.
[00:54:13.989 --> 00:54:15.951]  We go protest the Federal Reserve and Ron Paul.
[00:54:16.251 --> 00:54:17.292]  You're criminals!
[00:54:17.632 --> 00:54:18.633]  You're in the wrong!
[00:54:18.913 --> 00:54:19.774]  You're bad!
[00:54:20.034 --> 00:54:20.515]  Got it?
[00:54:20.995 --> 00:54:21.976]  Get it through your head!
[00:54:21.996 --> 00:54:27.380]  But see they hire these little nobody scumbags and people used to torturing people and spying on people in Iraq.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:29.621]  And they're bringing them all back here to do it to us.
[00:54:29.902 --> 00:54:30.722]  You are trash.
[00:54:30.742 --> 00:54:31.483]  You are scum.
[00:54:31.643 --> 00:54:32.643]  You're worse than Stalin.
[00:54:32.663 --> 00:54:33.764]  You're as bad as Hitler.
[00:54:34.024 --> 00:54:35.065]  You're as bad as linen.
[00:54:35.225 --> 00:54:35.925]  You're trash.
[00:54:35.945 --> 00:54:36.506]  You're filth.
[00:54:36.706 --> 00:54:37.847]  You're malice crap.
[00:54:38.067 --> 00:54:39.768]  You're pieces of un-American trash.
[00:54:39.988 --> 00:54:41.609]  Get the American flags off your car.
[00:54:41.869 --> 00:54:45.372]  Stop putting Browning stickers, deer-hunting stickers on your cars.
[00:54:45.612 --> 00:54:47.853]  Swaggin' around, you're an American.
[00:54:48.053 --> 00:54:49.234]  I know who you people are.
[00:54:49.414 --> 00:54:51.676]  You're a bunch of trash on power trips!
[00:54:52.256 --> 00:54:55.417]  And I swear we're going to bring you to justice when we take this country back.
[00:54:55.437 --> 00:54:57.938]  We've got to make sure you all get in trouble for what you've done.
[00:54:57.958 --> 00:55:00.259]  Because you'll just come right back like cancer!
[00:55:05.281 --> 00:55:09.303]  God, they go on ABC News and brag how they listen to you have sex with your wife and sit around laughing.
[00:55:09.523 --> 00:55:12.324]  The NSA guys literally just sit there in their offices masturbating.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:17.343]  I mean, that's just a bunch of scumbags masturbating, is what the NSA is.
[00:55:18.063 --> 00:55:18.764]  And covering up.
[00:55:18.964 --> 00:55:23.927]  Local cops were about to bust a government child kidnapping ring, NSA comes in to stop.
[00:55:24.467 --> 00:55:29.010]  Somebody catches government shipping drugs in, NSA finds out, comes in and blocks the investigation.
[00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:31.151]  It's all to make sure their crimes continue.
[00:55:31.391 --> 00:55:37.876]  And spying on Congress illegally, and running all their scams, and MI6 and MI5 spies on the British Parliament.
[00:55:38.236 --> 00:55:39.777]  You're criminals, we're gonna get you.
[00:55:40.077 --> 00:55:40.477]  You're criminals!
[00:55:41.818 --> 00:55:46.786]  And a lot of you are just compartmentalized, you just grab the data and pass it up to the sicko eggheads above you.
[00:55:46.806 --> 00:55:49.650]  Okay, now I'm getting mad.
[00:55:51.038 --> 00:56:01.081]  Just stop being in denial about what, and then the company that's made the vaccine is Baxter, caught putting weaponized bird flu in the vaccines, Bloomberg News, but you don't care.
[00:56:01.701 --> 00:56:14.064]  And people will take it and they'll die and you'll stick your kids to the ground and you'll go, proud being American, where at least I know I'm thumb scanned and everything gets listened to and the police wear black.
[00:56:14.764 --> 00:56:15.585]  We're good to go.
[00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:39.461]  The idiot-type redneck people that got to serve the New World Order are kind of the enforcers.
[00:56:39.761 --> 00:56:41.142]  It's like guerrillas, like policy.
[00:56:41.342 --> 00:56:46.763]  I mean, you know, I'm kind of ashamed I'm a little bit related to them.
[00:56:46.783 --> 00:56:48.804]  And they got a bunch of other scum working for them.
[00:56:48.844 --> 00:56:49.284]  I've seen you.
[00:56:49.304 --> 00:56:50.204]  You're a bunch of trash.
[00:56:50.804 --> 00:56:51.545]  Oh, I hate you.
[00:56:53.445 --> 00:56:55.886]  Liberty, folks, I'm really threatened by all this.
[00:56:55.906 --> 00:56:57.086]  I get a little fired up.
[00:56:58.326 --> 00:57:00.607]  But the spirit of liberty is infectious, is it not?
[00:57:03.806 --> 00:57:08.993]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:57:09.113 --> 00:57:13.499]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:57:13.639 --> 00:57:15.502]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:57:15.922 --> 00:57:17.284]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:57:17.544 --> 00:57:18.586]  There is a solution.
[00:57:18.806 --> 00:57:26.831]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:57:27.231 --> 00:57:34.316]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:46.304]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:57:46.724 --> 00:57:50.587]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[00:58:03.732 --> 00:58:07.716]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:07.976 --> 00:58:09.758]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:09.978 --> 00:58:18.267]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:58:18.507 --> 00:58:23.732]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:58:24.052 --> 00:58:25.674]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:58:25.894 --> 00:58:32.235]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:58:32.415 --> 00:58:43.158]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:58:43.458 --> 00:58:43.978]  That's right.
[00:58:44.238 --> 00:58:46.538]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[00:59:30.599 --> 00:59:37.121]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:59:37.502 --> 00:59:42.684]  Frontside provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[01:00:04.316 --> 01:00:09.398]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:09.759 --> 01:00:12.020]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:32.801 --> 01:00:36.244]  Alright, I just had my little 20 minute visit with the FBI.
[01:00:38.225 --> 01:00:39.145]  Never fun.
[01:00:41.047 --> 01:00:44.389]  And I have my new federal subpoena right here.
[01:00:44.409 --> 01:00:47.791]  And this time there's no gag order on it.
[01:00:50.153 --> 01:00:55.576]  And it deals with the case of that moron on InfoWars.com.
[01:00:55.876 --> 01:01:00.800]  Of course, he and others said the stuff a bunch of other places, but they don't care about that.
[01:01:02.117 --> 01:01:29.555]  uh... so i have to go to trial in virginia to testify which is just absolute crap that's it we have to go to a registration system on the comments on info wars in prison planet because it just goes on and on and and and i knew it when it was happening that the uh... first fbi agent fam this is his last name i can go pull all the stuff
[01:01:30.981 --> 01:01:31.941]  In fact, call Tim in there.
[01:01:31.961 --> 01:01:33.182]  He knows Pham's first name.
[01:01:34.183 --> 01:01:39.545]  Agent Pham kept calling people randomly in the office, asking questions about my business, asking questions about me.
[01:01:40.205 --> 01:01:42.907]  And I'm like, what is it you don't need to understand, FBI?
[01:01:47.869 --> 01:01:48.549]  It's a comment.
[01:01:48.849 --> 01:01:49.570]  We removed it.
[01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:51.271]  A week later, you call up with a subpoena.
[01:01:51.311 --> 01:01:54.032]  And the FBI's like, well, why did you remove it?
[01:01:55.145 --> 01:02:16.754]  Well, because I'm not going to have a cop's home number and name on the web and where his family lives with some stupid pothead, it turns out, sitting in his mommy's basement like an idiot from his own computer with his own IP address threatening the policeman's life that shot the dark guy in the back.
[01:02:23.637 --> 01:02:24.217]  And, uh,
[01:02:26.047 --> 01:02:31.713]  I knew it was either they wanted me as a witness with their snooping or they're trying to somehow tie me in with this.
[01:02:31.733 --> 01:02:37.038]  Because I had the FBI ask me, you don't agree with that, do you?
[01:02:38.252 --> 01:02:43.935]  And I went ahead and talked to him because there's no point in paying $5,000 to have some meeting with a lawyer, you know, thousands of dollars.
[01:02:45.336 --> 01:02:50.398]  But this is the kind of crap that I deal with and the type of stuff that goes on.
[01:02:50.498 --> 01:02:58.823]  I mean, you can go to YouTube right now and find hundreds of comments in the last hour naming police, naming people, saying go after them, nothing happens.
[01:02:59.463 --> 01:03:04.686]  I've talked to people at YouTube, they just ignore the subpoenas of such a big corporation and the feds just leave them alone.
[01:03:04.906 --> 01:03:06.887]  This is just a way to harass me.
[01:03:08.376 --> 01:03:12.957]  And I'm not saying that the Austin cop that was with the FBI, that these guys are here to harass me.
[01:03:13.537 --> 01:03:14.858]  They were definitely playing the good cop.
[01:03:14.918 --> 01:03:17.958]  Hey, we can get a beer sometime, yeah, I bet.
[01:03:20.619 --> 01:03:24.340]  I told them we ought to investigate DynCorp and Halliburton for the child kidnapping rings.
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:33.682]  In fact, pull up, if you Google or do a YouTube, DynCorp child kidnapping congressional hearing,
[01:03:34.881 --> 01:03:39.482]  And the Congresswoman asked Rumsfeld about it, and he says, yeah, well, they got in the penalty box for doing that.
[01:03:41.963 --> 01:03:50.565]  This is kidnapping children en masse to take them to Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Israel, other places, and it's like, ah, that's not my department.
[01:03:51.045 --> 01:03:58.727]  But see, there's all these FBI agents and people for some moron, pothead, who is an idiot.
[01:04:03.068 --> 01:04:03.628]  But, uh,
[01:04:07.741 --> 01:04:11.363]  See, the threats can be on MySpace, the threats can be on YouTube, they can be everywhere.
[01:04:11.723 --> 01:04:15.664]  It's my website, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:04:16.625 --> 01:04:22.567]  I have the White House, open surrogates, George Soros, newspapers, magazines, every day attacking me now.
[01:04:23.007 --> 01:04:24.307]  CNN went after me.
[01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:27.909]  Ed Schultz went after me on MSNBC this week.
[01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:33.310]  Or whatever his name is, something Schultz, big pumpkin head guy.
[01:04:34.611 --> 01:04:34.791]  What?
[01:04:36.704 --> 01:04:37.725]  Not Shepard Smith.
[01:04:38.185 --> 01:04:39.546]  Shepard Smith hadn't gone after me.
[01:04:43.149 --> 01:04:45.051]  I don't recognize the idiots on CNN.
[01:04:45.331 --> 01:04:46.932]  The clip's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:04:49.274 --> 01:04:51.936]  I do recognize former Air America guy.
[01:04:51.956 --> 01:04:57.580]  Got like kinda curly short red hair, looks like his head's twice the size of mine, which is, that's pretty big.
[01:04:58.241 --> 01:04:59.502]  I got somewhat of a pumpkin head.
[01:05:06.666 --> 01:05:07.707]  I'm just so sick of it.
[01:05:09.247 --> 01:05:10.648]  Did you find the clip?
[01:05:12.468 --> 01:05:13.269]  It's easy to find.
[01:05:14.149 --> 01:05:14.729]  We're pulling it up.
[01:05:14.769 --> 01:05:19.651]  I want to go out to break with this, and then I want to... We've got Bob Chapman come up.
[01:05:19.671 --> 01:05:20.591]  We're just going to take calls 1-800-259-9231.
[01:05:20.611 --> 01:05:20.671]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:05:30.356 --> 01:05:32.257]  Hey, I want to thank folks that showed up at the office.
[01:05:32.317 --> 01:05:45.923]  Very few people know where my office is because I can't have fans and supporters banging on the door all day demanding to meet with me because I got work to do, but the few people that have been over here with guests and folks were starting to show up in the parking lot ten minutes after I made the announcement that the FBI was here.
[01:05:49.341 --> 01:05:52.263]  Meanwhile, I'm the big criminal that has to be dealt with.
[01:05:52.623 --> 01:06:06.674]  I was telling these cops, hey, I got an eco-science textbook about how they want to drug the water supply and sterilize the population and take everyone's children at birth and IEDs to forcibly sterilize everybody.
[01:06:09.366 --> 01:06:10.347]  I said, do you want to see that?
[01:06:10.407 --> 01:06:11.668]  No, no, we don't want to see that.
[01:06:11.748 --> 01:06:13.049]  No, you don't want to know about that.
[01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:16.112]  I said, they're putting stuff in the water to drug us, pal.
[01:06:16.952 --> 01:06:19.414]  And they said, no, we have no doubt you're right about that.
[01:06:19.835 --> 01:06:21.696]  Well, I mean, why are we not on the same team?
[01:06:22.457 --> 01:06:23.438]  Because it's your job.
[01:06:23.458 --> 01:06:25.620]  Let me tell you something.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:26.921]  Is Tim here?
[01:06:26.941 --> 01:06:28.942]  I just want Pham's first name.
[01:06:30.624 --> 01:06:31.585]  Oh, it's Dan Pham?
[01:06:32.728 --> 01:06:33.589]  Ben Pham.
[01:06:34.369 --> 01:06:35.911]  I can barely hear you when you go to the microphone.
[01:06:36.311 --> 01:06:37.292]  Ben Pham.
[01:06:37.592 --> 01:06:41.495]  FBI agent Ben Pham was asking me everything with my blood type.
[01:06:43.517 --> 01:06:48.921]  And I was like, this has nothing to do.
[01:06:49.421 --> 01:06:50.722]  A guy commented on the page.
[01:06:50.782 --> 01:06:51.503]  We took it down.
[01:06:52.023 --> 01:06:54.245]  You called up and told me to put it back up.
[01:06:54.746 --> 01:06:56.887]  And I'm not going to let you set me up, pal.
[01:06:57.088 --> 01:07:01.211]  I'm not going to post the cop's name and phone number and somebody saying kill him.
[01:07:04.033 --> 01:07:04.614]  And you know what?
[01:07:04.774 --> 01:07:07.015]  That is immoral that I was told to do that.
[01:07:09.236 --> 01:07:12.038]  Or maybe Pham just is stupid.
[01:07:13.019 --> 01:07:13.479]  I don't know.
[01:07:14.119 --> 01:07:15.640]  But let me just explain something here.
[01:07:16.681 --> 01:07:17.721]  I'm not going to do that.
[01:07:18.222 --> 01:07:20.123]  Because he would have said, I never told you that.
[01:07:21.724 --> 01:07:22.985]  I never told you to put that up.
[01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:25.708]  You made the threat when you put it back up.
[01:07:26.429 --> 01:07:36.398]  I have no doubt they'd like to get me for something, and they've been through all my taxes, all my files, everything, and they've got these guys who are just errand boys over here snooping on me.
[01:07:36.759 --> 01:07:37.800]  And I'm tired of it!
[01:07:39.942 --> 01:07:46.088]  I'm going to continue my work, and if you guys put me in prison on some set-up baloney, people are only going to spread the word that much more.
[01:07:48.865 --> 01:07:50.308]  What, did the computers crash in there?
[01:07:50.328 --> 01:07:52.072]  I want to buy new computers at work.
[01:07:52.613 --> 01:07:54.838]  I mean, they're trying to pull up the video.
[01:07:54.878 --> 01:07:57.042]  Here, I'll do it on my little computer and play the audio from here.
[01:07:59.076 --> 01:07:59.496]  We have it.
[01:07:59.536 --> 01:08:00.457]  Go ahead and play the clip.
[01:08:00.777 --> 01:08:03.679]  This is what the FBI needs to be investigating.
[01:08:04.059 --> 01:08:06.400]  Instead, they got a big office right downtown Austin.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.782]  I walked up and told cops out front that one night, I said, you know they run child kidnapping rings.
[01:08:11.123 --> 01:08:15.065]  And the cops just laughed at me and said, I work in there some.
[01:08:15.405 --> 01:08:16.506]  It's real funny, isn't it?
[01:08:16.526 --> 01:08:21.949]  Yeah, well, it'll be funny when you shoot your kid up with that vaccine and their hair falls out when they're 18 and they die.
[01:08:21.969 --> 01:08:24.770]  Because you didn't listen to me and you laughed at me.
[01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:26.351]  I know what I'm talking about.
[01:08:26.371 --> 01:08:27.812]  Go ahead and play the clip.
[01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:30.511]  Oh, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[01:08:32.172 --> 01:08:45.341]  Mr. Secretary, I watched President Bush deliver a moving speech at the United Nations in September 2003, in which he mentioned the crisis of the sex trade.
[01:08:46.294 --> 01:08:50.396]  The President called for the punishment of those involved in this horrible business.
[01:08:51.136 --> 01:08:59.479]  But at the very moment of that speech, DynCorp was exposed for having been involved in the buying and selling of young women and children.
[01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:12.905]  While all of this was going on, DynCorp kept the Pentagon contract to administer the smallpox and anthrax vaccines, and is now working on a plague vaccine through the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program.
[01:09:14.266 --> 01:09:16.429]  Mr. Secretary, is it policy of the U.S.
[01:09:16.469 --> 01:09:19.933]  government to reward companies that traffic in women and little girls?
[01:09:20.654 --> 01:09:21.775]  That's my first question.
[01:09:21.815 --> 01:09:33.090]  My second question, Mr. Secretary, according to the Comptroller General of the United States, there are serious financial management problems at the Pentagon, to which Mr. Cooper alluded.
[01:09:33.837 --> 01:09:37.163]  Fiscal year 1999, $2.3 trillion missing.
[01:09:37.744 --> 01:09:40.909]  Fiscal year 2000, $1.1 trillion missing.
[01:09:41.751 --> 01:09:46.439]  And DOD is the number one reason why the government can't balance this checkbook.
[01:09:47.324 --> 01:09:54.647]  The Pentagon has claimed year after year that the reason it can't account for the money is because its computers don't communicate with each other.
[01:09:55.388 --> 01:10:02.751]  My second question, Mr. Secretary, is who has the contracts today to make those systems communicate with each other?
[01:10:03.371 --> 01:10:05.812]  How long have they had those contracts?
[01:10:06.413 --> 01:10:08.834]  And how much have the taxpayers paid for them?
[01:10:09.690 --> 01:10:19.757]  Finally, Mr. Secretary, after the last hearing, I thought that my office was promised a written response to my question regarding the four war games on September 11th.
[01:10:20.437 --> 01:10:32.886]  I have not yet received that response, but would like for you to respond to the questions that I've put to you today, and then I do expect the written response to my previous question, hopefully by the end of the week.
[01:10:35.763 --> 01:10:37.864]  Thank you, Representative.
[01:10:38.885 --> 01:10:43.188]  First, the answer to your first question is no, absolutely not.
[01:10:43.348 --> 01:10:53.356]  The policy of the United States government is clear, unambiguous, and opposed to the activities that you described.
[01:10:54.156 --> 01:10:57.339]  The second question
[01:10:57.961 --> 01:11:06.916]  Well, how do you explain the fact that DynCorp and its successor companies have received and continue to receive government contracts?
[01:11:08.576 --> 01:11:34.177]  I would have to go and and find the facts but there are laws and rules and regulations with respect to government contracts and there are times that corporations do things they should not do in which case they tend to be suspended for some period there are times then that that the under the laws and the rules and regulations for the that uh... passed by the congress and implemented by the executive branch that corporations can get off of
[01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:35.979]  I'm going to play the rest of this later.
[01:11:35.999 --> 01:11:36.839]  We've got to go to break.
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:41.622]  See, this isn't just McKinney who people can try to poo-poo and say, oh, she's whatever.
[01:11:41.642 --> 01:11:43.823]  This is Rumsfeld responding to the question.
[01:11:43.863 --> 01:11:44.604]  He knows all about it.
[01:11:45.064 --> 01:11:46.605]  And then they go on to respond.
[01:11:47.805 --> 01:11:51.007]  And just, again, because the corporation has more rights than a person.
[01:11:51.488 --> 01:11:56.050]  The corporation is allowed to kidnap children and then just get a fine.
[01:11:56.851 --> 01:11:58.071]  I mean, that's how this works.
[01:11:58.712 --> 01:11:59.712]  You don't go to prison.
[01:11:59.932 --> 01:12:01.133]  You don't get the death penalty.
[01:12:01.794 --> 01:12:02.594]  You get more power.
[01:12:02.634 --> 01:12:03.715]  You get government contracts.
[01:12:04.395 --> 01:12:10.881]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes.com, the makers of the highest quality vault doors and safes available.

[01:13:55.345 --> 01:13:55.985]  A new world order.
[01:13:56.005 --> 01:13:56.605]  In the near future.
[01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:13.151]  The Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:14:13.571 --> 01:14:16.411]  It's known as the Builderberg Group.
[01:14:16.431 --> 01:14:18.632]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:14:19.172 --> 01:14:21.633]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:14:22.353 --> 01:14:29.674]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:14:32.711 --> 01:14:37.693]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[01:14:45.756 --> 01:14:46.516]  They're not after money.
[01:14:46.536 --> 01:14:47.637]  They have all the money they need.
[01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:48.537]  They're after power.
[01:14:48.797 --> 01:14:49.657]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:16:10.046 --> 01:16:13.048]  We got a surprise guest coming up in the final hour today.
[01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:18.491]  We're going to open the phones up for Bob Chapman, specifically your questions on the economy.
[01:16:19.352 --> 01:16:20.973]  The economy in period.
[01:16:21.393 --> 01:16:23.174]  Bob, sorry to get you on late today.
[01:16:23.234 --> 01:16:32.040]  I had the FBI with the APD here in the office with my federal subpoena to go to Virginia in the case
[01:16:33.723 --> 01:16:35.884]  of some idiot putting comments on my website.
[01:16:36.644 --> 01:16:38.404]  Why they need me to testify, I don't know.
[01:16:38.484 --> 01:16:41.325]  Hopefully this moron will plea bargain so I don't have to go.
[01:16:42.085 --> 01:16:46.126]  But, uh, what an interesting, interesting day, Bob.
[01:16:46.146 --> 01:16:49.507]  It is fantastic.
[01:16:51.467 --> 01:16:56.109]  The world keeps on rolling deeper and deeper into the mire, so to speak.
[01:16:57.809 --> 01:17:01.870]  And, uh, but I'm glad that it's something as simple as that.
[01:17:02.628 --> 01:17:03.569]  But it's not simple.
[01:17:03.609 --> 01:17:06.332]  They keep asking me if I agree with the comments and things.
[01:17:06.352 --> 01:17:08.375]  They're definitely trying to untrap you.
[01:17:08.695 --> 01:17:10.337]  Yeah, they definitely want to put my butt in prison.
[01:17:11.418 --> 01:17:15.342]  What you do is just be very nice and say, hey, my attorney's on his way over.
[01:17:15.362 --> 01:17:20.088]  I already gave them my lawyer's name and number for next time and they still showed up.
[01:17:20.108 --> 01:17:20.868]  They don't care.
[01:17:20.889 --> 01:17:22.110]  They'll still try it.
[01:17:24.810 --> 01:17:26.011]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[01:17:26.351 --> 01:17:30.014]  I post a comment, we remove it before we're ever subpoenaed.
[01:17:30.775 --> 01:17:33.277]  We have to go dig it out of the records under the federal subpoena.
[01:17:34.097 --> 01:17:37.200]  And then they're still here asking me what I think of the comment.
[01:17:39.261 --> 01:17:41.363]  Again, you know, the entrapment.
[01:17:41.903 --> 01:17:43.504]  Hey Bob, you've dealt with these people before.
[01:17:43.544 --> 01:17:46.987]  What do you think about the original agent telling me to repost it?
[01:17:49.169 --> 01:17:50.370]  I think that's entrapment.
[01:17:51.926 --> 01:17:58.551]  I mean, why would you want to put something back on that wasn't very nice or good or evil or against the law?
[01:18:00.772 --> 01:18:01.393]  Oh, Jesus.
[01:18:01.973 --> 01:18:03.114]  I'm just... Excuse me, God.
[01:18:03.814 --> 01:18:06.256]  I am so sick of these people.
[01:18:06.356 --> 01:18:12.240]  You've got to mentally train yourself to deal with people who deal with real criminals all the time.
[01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:17.604]  And what happens to the police mind is they get like the criminal mind.
[01:18:18.214 --> 01:18:25.780]  And so they think everybody else might be a criminal, so they approach everything that way, including members of their own family.
[01:18:27.281 --> 01:18:30.143]  It's something that happens to people in law enforcement.
[01:18:32.045 --> 01:18:41.412]  And I have two members of my family who are in law enforcement, one of them just retired, as assistant chief of police in a major city, and that's the way it is.
[01:18:43.171 --> 01:18:47.832]  Well, they didn't like it when I was rattling off FBI crimes to them and saying that's why I don't trust you.
[01:18:48.732 --> 01:18:51.513]  How to win friends and influence people.
[01:18:51.853 --> 01:18:52.833]  You devil you.
[01:18:55.214 --> 01:18:58.074]  You know, they were actually... I didn't get a really bad vibe.
[01:18:58.594 --> 01:19:00.215]  One time with the BATF I did.
[01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:04.295]  I mean, my alarms were saying criminal, criminal, criminal, watch out, watch out.
[01:19:05.516 --> 01:19:06.416]  Totally different vibe.
[01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:10.137]  I had to put up with them for about 40 years.
[01:19:11.237 --> 01:19:11.777]  And, uh...
[01:19:12.407 --> 01:19:19.832]  And they didn't like me very much at all, and they in the Marshal's office are not very exemplary.
[01:19:20.853 --> 01:19:28.298]  There's lots of good people in law enforcement, but those two groups didn't get the best of the crop, let's put it that way.
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:30.660]  Yeah.
[01:19:32.241 --> 01:19:34.623]  Well, they've stolen $23.7 trillion in growing.
[01:19:36.846 --> 01:19:45.110]  The unemployment skyrocketing, and there's all this baloney news about how great the economy is, and new home sales uptick.
[01:19:45.150 --> 01:19:46.070]  Then I read the number.
[01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:51.712]  It said the decline slowed, but the AP headline said it had grown.
[01:19:52.133 --> 01:19:53.953]  I mean, they are cooking some numbers, Bob.
[01:19:54.714 --> 01:20:04.518]  They certainly are, and they're all in on it, and they're all controlled in the media by the same people, and there's nothing we can do about it except
[01:20:05.507 --> 01:20:20.013]  On this program and others like it, tell people the truth, keep on pumping out what is really happening, and we're challenging them, we're pushing them to greater heights, and ourselves as well, to put them down.
[01:20:20.193 --> 01:20:21.073]  They're terrified.
[01:20:21.153 --> 01:20:22.874]  We just discussed this before.
[01:20:23.454 --> 01:20:25.395]  And that's why I do so many programs.
[01:20:25.915 --> 01:20:32.118]  Incidentally, Alex, I'm going to be on with Judge Norrie's program, Saturday Night.
[01:20:33.388 --> 01:20:35.650]  And it's the first time in a long time I've been on there.
[01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:36.931]  Good!
[01:20:37.531 --> 01:20:42.675]  But we're banging away, and we're not going to give up, and we're making headway.
[01:20:43.076 --> 01:20:57.607]  We're helping people plan for emergencies, both personal and physical, and as well as their finances, what should probably happen in the course of events.
[01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:09.613]  And we can explain to them how people can steal $23.7 trillion, a colossal figure which boggles the mind.
[01:21:10.494 --> 01:21:17.479]  But, you know, if you lived in that culture like I did for 28 years, you don't know that anything goes.
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:20.081]  And they're always skating down the edge.
[01:21:20.582 --> 01:21:24.365]  I mean, it's part of the mental concept that goes with the market.
[01:21:25.826 --> 01:21:27.067]  And so it's not
[01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:30.512]  Disturbing or unusual that they do something like that.
[01:21:30.532 --> 01:21:32.534]  All right, Bob.
[01:21:32.674 --> 01:21:35.296]  Let's break down the latest developments in the economy.
[01:21:35.416 --> 01:21:36.957]  Is it getting better, like they're saying?
[01:21:36.977 --> 01:21:39.139]  Like they said three years ago it was getting better?
[01:21:39.599 --> 01:21:40.360]  Or are they lying?
[01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:43.682]  I think I know the answer to that question, but we'll also take your calls.
[01:21:43.702 --> 01:21:44.703]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:21:44.743 --> 01:21:45.744]  Infowars.com is the website.
[01:21:45.764 --> 01:21:46.244]  We're on the march.
[01:21:46.264 --> 01:21:47.745]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:58.448 --> 01:22:01.249]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:09.170]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:22:09.370 --> 01:22:13.171]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:22:13.391 --> 01:22:18.993]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:22:19.293 --> 01:22:24.174]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:22:24.374 --> 01:22:24.874]  Number three,
[01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:30.739]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:34.242]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:38.686]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:22:39.007 --> 01:22:42.650]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:22:42.850 --> 01:22:48.355]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long-time sponsor of ours.
[01:22:48.575 --> 01:22:51.698]  You can get more information at www.solutionsfromscience.com.

[01:23:05.959 --> 01:23:10.642]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:23:10.702 --> 01:23:13.443]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:23:13.663 --> 01:23:16.505]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:23:16.685 --> 01:23:22.588]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:23:22.788 --> 01:23:25.650]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:23:26.010 --> 01:23:32.915]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:23:33.015 --> 01:23:36.117]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[01:24:03.899 --> 01:24:07.883]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:09.925]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:24:10.145 --> 01:24:18.433]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:24:18.674 --> 01:24:23.899]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:24:24.219 --> 01:24:25.861]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:24:26.081 --> 01:24:32.405]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:24:32.585 --> 01:24:43.353]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:24:43.653 --> 01:24:44.153]  That's right.
[01:24:44.413 --> 01:24:46.715]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:24:46.975 --> 01:24:48.556]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.

[01:25:22.284 --> 01:25:25.745]  Don't forget the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.

[01:25:30.627 --> 01:25:34.569]  You can get this film free when you get it with Endgame or The Obama Deception.
[01:25:35.249 --> 01:25:38.010]  An interview with Aaron Russo, Reflections and Warnings.
[01:25:39.011 --> 01:25:40.431]  Great new documentary.
[01:25:40.631 --> 01:25:44.473]  Global Warming, Emerging Science and Understanding.
[01:25:44.533 --> 01:25:46.974]  Everybody needs to see this to understand the carbon tax fraud.
[01:25:48.322 --> 01:25:52.304]  Fabled Enemies, the latest 9-11 film out there, breaking down how the attacks were carried out.
[01:25:52.845 --> 01:25:54.866]  Of course, a new Mar-a-Lago, the Obama deception.
[01:25:55.166 --> 01:25:59.589]  By the way, I gave the FBI and APD some Obama deceptions when they were here earlier.
[01:25:59.609 --> 01:26:00.709]  I'm not kidding.
[01:26:01.190 --> 01:26:02.310]  I said, research material.
[01:26:02.330 --> 01:26:04.392]  Maybe you can find something to set me up for in here.
[01:26:07.514 --> 01:26:10.555]  This obviously is more than just this guy posting on the comment page.
[01:26:10.575 --> 01:26:14.478]  You're asking all sorts of questions about, do I agree with it?
[01:26:15.856 --> 01:26:17.257]  Why would I take it down?
[01:26:17.317 --> 01:26:19.078]  Why the hell do you think I would take it down?
[01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:25.942]  Infowars.com or call toll free to get the books and videos 888-253-3139 888-253-3139 There is a
[01:26:41.204 --> 01:26:43.386]  So much to go over, so much to cover here.
[01:26:44.187 --> 01:26:50.413]  Bob, I want to just go right to calls, because we rarely take a lot of calls when you're on, so you can cover the issues.
[01:26:50.433 --> 01:26:52.795]  But specifically, the economy.
[01:26:54.016 --> 01:27:03.264]  The media is saying everything is wonderful now, as record repossessions, record credit card defaults, home loan defaults, car defaults, car loan defaults.
[01:27:04.245 --> 01:27:06.568]  Just every economic indicator is we're in deep trouble.
[01:27:07.188 --> 01:27:17.596]  And they're still just saying everything's wonderful, everything's wonderful, as the banks now, as we said six, eight months ago, took the bailout money and are hoarding it, and they're paying other banks not to loan.
[01:27:18.217 --> 01:27:19.858]  Why do they not want banks loaning?
[01:27:20.499 --> 01:27:21.840]  Where is the economy really going?
[01:27:23.861 --> 01:27:24.182]  Down.
[01:27:25.303 --> 01:27:29.326]  And they're trying to tell us that the GDP for the second quarter was minus one percent.
[01:27:29.986 --> 01:27:33.769]  Now, the previous quarter, and I don't believe that figure, was minus 5.4 percent.
[01:27:35.276 --> 01:27:37.257]  And the one before that was minus 6.7.
[01:27:37.898 --> 01:27:42.521]  You don't take quantum leaps like that over quarter to quarter.
[01:27:42.541 --> 01:27:45.343]  I mean, that's a tremendous difference.
[01:27:46.304 --> 01:27:46.964]  And they're lying!
[01:27:47.485 --> 01:27:54.890]  I don't believe the figures one bit, and when I posted them for tomorrow's International Forecaster at the end, I said, I don't believe these figures one bit.
[01:27:56.151 --> 01:28:04.897]  And so they just lie, and it's all part of a propaganda, sci-war campaign to make you believe that the economy's doing good, so you go out and
[01:28:06.274 --> 01:28:06.894]  Absolutely, my friend.
[01:28:06.914 --> 01:28:07.115]  There is
[01:28:20.759 --> 01:28:23.381]  There's a lot of concern out there about the flu.
[01:28:24.082 --> 01:28:33.670]  Clearly, they're using it as a political cover, a way to pose as saviors, a way to make tens of billions off vaccine, but they're now announcing they are going to use the army for forced inoculations.
[01:28:34.251 --> 01:28:36.513]  They are going to try to forcibly shoot up the kids.
[01:28:36.553 --> 01:28:39.135]  They're trying to make enough vaccine for every American.
[01:28:39.555 --> 01:28:43.399]  Obama, Dr. Barack Obama wants everybody to take three shots at least.
[01:28:44.386 --> 01:28:46.227]  For a non-event flu.
[01:28:47.107 --> 01:28:48.448]  So it's clearly a Psy-Op.
[01:28:48.788 --> 01:28:49.929]  The question is, how bad?
[01:28:50.009 --> 01:28:52.110]  Is there some real bio-weapon they're going to release?
[01:28:52.710 --> 01:28:56.652]  You know, that's what they talk about in their own government textbooks, like Ecoscience.
[01:28:56.692 --> 01:28:57.512]  Here's a copy of it.
[01:28:58.033 --> 01:29:00.414]  Drugging the water, the vaccines, how to do it.
[01:29:00.434 --> 01:29:03.375]  I mean, they say they're going to do it, and they've been caught doing it.
[01:29:03.395 --> 01:29:09.298]  I mean, but I guess it's extreme and conspiracy theory to actually read their book and then be concerned about it.
[01:29:15.438 --> 01:29:18.880]  Well, Alex, wait till they find out how many people are going to refuse to take it.
[01:29:20.841 --> 01:29:23.063]  Not only in the United States, but throughout the world.
[01:29:23.103 --> 01:29:25.985]  Now, I know it's mandatory already in some countries.
[01:29:27.245 --> 01:29:32.989]  And a lot of people aren't going to take it because they're listening to the information that you and I and others are putting out.
[01:29:33.029 --> 01:29:38.112]  My goodness, my health section is now, because of this, as big as my U.S.
[01:29:38.132 --> 01:29:39.433]  section of my publication.
[01:29:39.973 --> 01:29:42.915]  But everything that's good that I read that comes through, I post it.
[01:29:43.613 --> 01:29:44.114]  And a link.
[01:29:44.474 --> 01:29:47.056]  And so the people are finding out everywhere.
[01:29:47.897 --> 01:29:51.500]  And I've had tremendous amount of requests of people wanting to leave the country.
[01:29:51.921 --> 01:29:59.468]  Because as you well know, in other countries like in Latin America or Asia, they're not as sticky about everybody having a shot.
[01:30:01.149 --> 01:30:03.932]  You know, they might say you should, but they won't enforce it.
[01:30:04.572 --> 01:30:06.254]  But they will in the United States and in Europe.
[01:30:10.956 --> 01:30:13.598]  But what do you think the PSYOP's all about?
[01:30:13.638 --> 01:30:19.541]  Have a big political smokescreen to pass cap-and-trade, the gun bills, the open border bills, the water grab bill.
[01:30:19.861 --> 01:30:21.643]  And their whole agenda is stalling.
[01:30:22.603 --> 01:30:27.626]  And we see them building mass graves, getting the military ready since January that we know of.
[01:30:27.966 --> 01:30:32.469]  Then they prime the hype in April for this non-event of a few deaths.
[01:30:33.069 --> 01:30:35.051]  And then now they're acting like it's the end of the world.
[01:30:35.876 --> 01:30:37.397]  And that's just not how flu works.
[01:30:37.417 --> 01:30:41.999]  All these top epidemiologists are on the news saying this is all a fraud, but that they don't know why.
[01:30:42.019 --> 01:30:48.522]  I think it's completely clear they're planning on using this as a pretext to lock everything down in the middle of the depression.
[01:30:49.563 --> 01:30:51.664]  Or it could just be a beta test for that down the road.
[01:30:51.704 --> 01:30:53.124]  We know they're federalizing everything.
[01:30:53.164 --> 01:30:56.226]  We know we're under UN control under this level 6.
[01:30:56.706 --> 01:30:59.728]  I mean... Alex, you're right.
[01:30:59.828 --> 01:31:04.510]  It's a beta test to see what gains they can make
[01:31:05.566 --> 01:31:08.747]  To see what the reaction of the people is going to be.
[01:31:09.948 --> 01:31:19.932]  And then they'll know when the big one comes, so to speak, two or three years down the line here, maybe in six months for all we know, what the reaction will be.
[01:31:20.533 --> 01:31:24.615]  And of course, the shots that you have will be worthless against the next slew that they've created.
[01:31:25.135 --> 01:31:31.478]  One of the things that I married this possibility to is the
[01:31:32.828 --> 01:31:36.489]  As you know, back in May, I said that the U.S.
[01:31:36.549 --> 01:31:38.330]  embassies were receiving U.S.
[01:31:38.350 --> 01:31:42.492]  dollars to be traded for local currencies, and I backed into that.
[01:31:42.772 --> 01:31:44.132]  And that's verified.
[01:31:44.212 --> 01:31:46.753]  I've got several sources on that.
[01:31:47.694 --> 01:31:50.095]  And I said to myself, well, why would they do that?
[01:31:50.215 --> 01:31:52.996]  Well, it's because the dollar's going to go down, and they know it.
[01:31:53.696 --> 01:31:59.898]  And when it goes down, others, especially commercial people in other countries, will not want to receive dollars.
[01:31:59.938 --> 01:32:01.779]  They want to be paid some other way.
[01:32:02.555 --> 01:32:05.357]  I think the dollar will fall from $79.50 to the support level of $71.18.
[01:32:29.853 --> 01:32:34.036]  And during that period of time, you'll have this flu situation going.
[01:32:34.536 --> 01:32:38.759]  You'll have legislation which has been ground to a halt.
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:44.823]  And I think they're going to do a beta test of three to five days on shutting the banks down.
[01:32:45.744 --> 01:32:47.365]  There's a good possibility of that.
[01:32:48.025 --> 01:32:52.008]  And then the next time around, when they shut the banks down, they're not going to open them.
[01:32:53.539 --> 01:33:19.530]  And then they're going to have a devaluation, and they're going to have a default, and they're going to have a big powwow like they did in the early 70s in the Smithonian talks, and then at 1985 at the Plaza Accords, and all of these countries will get together, and they will have formulas for devaluing those currencies against revaluing these currencies, and there will be a default
[01:33:21.295 --> 01:33:22.596]  It's like a bad dream, Bob.
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:52.841]  I mean, everybody I know is either losing their job or getting pay cuts.
[01:33:53.781 --> 01:33:55.722]  The economy is just falling apart everywhere.
[01:33:55.742 --> 01:33:58.883]  And they're not bringing the factories back.
[01:33:58.903 --> 01:34:00.183]  They're not bringing the jobs back.
[01:34:00.243 --> 01:34:12.706]  They are, by design, the White House Economic Science Czar says in his own textbooks he wants to shut down the economy and how to destroy the U.S.
[01:34:12.746 --> 01:34:14.187]  economy is described in here.
[01:34:15.345 --> 01:34:18.467]  And that's actually what is covered in the book, Ecoscience.
[01:34:19.748 --> 01:34:22.089]  I mean, that's what they're doing now.
[01:34:22.750 --> 01:34:30.874]  It's that they're so over-the-top criminal that we're almost defenseless against it just because we can't even imagine they're this corrupt.
[01:34:33.316 --> 01:34:39.880]  I've always said that it is very, very difficult for the average, decent human mind
[01:34:40.563 --> 01:34:46.406]  To even contemplate the diabolical criminality of these people.
[01:34:47.147 --> 01:34:50.109]  They just can't believe people can be that bad just like you just said.
[01:34:55.652 --> 01:34:56.232]  So sick.
[01:34:57.413 --> 01:34:58.393]  It's like a bad dream.
[01:35:00.652 --> 01:35:28.008]  A caller said a few days ago, and I've since been repeating this, it's true, it's like being in a car with a maniac driving it, at 150 miles an hour down a road, and you know over the next hill there's a hairpin turn, a 25 mile an hour turn, and you're telling them, look lunatic, slow down, it's real, there's danger over that hill, and they just say, shut up conspiracy theorist, and you're all strapped in, and they're driving like a maniac about to kill you, and that's how I felt talking to these FBI guys, it's just,
[01:35:29.525 --> 01:35:31.727]  I'd tell them about the New World Order and it's all just funny.
[01:35:31.767 --> 01:35:32.547]  It's all a joke.
[01:35:32.587 --> 01:35:33.308]  It's all a game.
[01:35:33.388 --> 01:35:35.309]  No, it isn't a game.
[01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:36.550]  It isn't a joke.
[01:35:37.051 --> 01:35:37.631]  It's real.
[01:35:39.973 --> 01:35:40.754]  It surely is.
[01:35:44.797 --> 01:35:48.679]  What do you see Obama doing as his approval rating plunges?
[01:35:48.699 --> 01:35:52.682]  Well, I predicted in January that in September or October it would be 40.
[01:35:53.523 --> 01:35:54.764]  And I guess the rest of the U.S.
[01:35:54.804 --> 01:35:57.046]  has it at 45 right now or something like that.
[01:35:57.614 --> 01:36:05.038]  Yeah, it was Rasmussen had it 49 last week, and now it's dropped to 40 in some demographics, but overall 47.
[01:36:05.679 --> 01:36:07.300]  And other polls have got him at 49, 48, 47.
[01:36:09.321 --> 01:36:16.445]  And these are groups that normally cook polls, so he is just... Well, he's plunged faster than any president in modern history.
[01:36:18.286 --> 01:36:20.748]  Yep, and his...
[01:36:22.054 --> 01:36:35.136]  His claim to great fortune is that he settled a dispute, Cambridge Massachusetts, over somebody who'd been picked up by the police and he said we can get this all sorted out by having a beer together.
[01:36:35.697 --> 01:36:38.138]  Incidentally, Alex, do you know who Jackie Mason is?
[01:36:38.158 --> 01:36:40.059]  Yes, to the moon without a rocket.
[01:37:05.467 --> 01:37:07.889]  Well, he's one of my favorite comics.
[01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:12.974]  And he just did a piece on Obama, and I've got the link... Oh, no, no, no, no, that was Jackie Gleason.
[01:37:13.014 --> 01:37:14.616]  Yeah, no, no, I know who Jackie Mason is.
[01:37:14.656 --> 01:37:16.518]  He goes on Fox News, sure.
[01:37:17.319 --> 01:37:20.962]  Yeah, and anyway, he's just made a tape about Mr. Obama, our president.
[01:37:21.703 --> 01:37:25.427]  And you'll see it tomorrow in my issue, the link.
[01:37:26.227 --> 01:37:27.869]  And he really takes him apart.
[01:37:27.929 --> 01:37:29.791]  He says Mr. Obama is a racist.
[01:37:33.697 --> 01:37:35.558]  Well, I don't even know if Mr. Obama is a racist.
[01:37:35.618 --> 01:37:36.979]  He is a race pimp.
[01:37:37.039 --> 01:37:38.100]  He's a social engineer.
[01:37:38.140 --> 01:37:39.981]  He knows how to play everybody off against each other.
[01:37:42.723 --> 01:37:43.804]  Anyway, it's entertaining.
[01:37:45.905 --> 01:37:49.047]  I just... I... Well, let's just take calls.
[01:37:49.708 --> 01:37:50.628]  I'm speechless here.
[01:37:51.789 --> 01:37:52.990]  Maggie in Arizona.
[01:37:53.050 --> 01:37:54.071]  Maggie, you're on the air.
[01:37:54.131 --> 01:37:54.531]  Go ahead.
[01:37:55.952 --> 01:37:56.592]  Oh, hello.
[01:37:56.712 --> 01:38:00.395]  It's such a privilege to talk to you, Alex, and to you too, Mr. Chapman.
[01:38:01.918 --> 01:38:21.707]  Um, what I'm asking about is, Alex, I understand, I missed part of the show yesterday, unfortunately, and I understand that there was an email and a caller regarding possible confirmation, seeing something from the Feds in regards to a bank calling for the late August undetermined links.
[01:38:22.308 --> 01:38:27.750]  I'm wondering if you might... No, no, she was, she was, and we did get the document,
[01:38:29.481 --> 01:38:39.826]  And we've gotten other similar documents and documents with hospital workers being told they have to take shots and then a day after the guy told us that and gave us the document it was actually in the news.
[01:38:40.487 --> 01:38:50.352]  So this was a bank that is in New Orleans and they were saying we're going to have these injections for you.
[01:38:54.057 --> 01:39:08.725]  From another source I heard they actually did get an email from someone who has a close friend in the banking industry and she saw a notification stating that they would be closing undetermined links.
[01:39:09.145 --> 01:39:12.147]  The date will be determined late in August.
[01:39:12.287 --> 01:39:18.630]  Yeah, well there's a lot of banks themselves that are closing or being taken over so there's a lot of those notices going out.
[01:39:19.130 --> 01:39:20.231]  But the establishment
[01:39:21.141 --> 01:39:24.022]  May have a bank holiday, but really they're just going to devalue the currency.
[01:39:24.842 --> 01:39:26.783]  But we have the expert on the line with us.
[01:39:26.843 --> 01:39:27.883]  Ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[01:39:28.504 --> 01:39:29.804]  Can you answer Maggie's question?
[01:39:29.824 --> 01:39:36.706]  We do know, and I did confirm this, the State Department has all its embassies moving mostly out of their cash reserves.
[01:39:36.726 --> 01:39:42.648]  They have millions per embassy in these vaults for different payoffs and different emergencies and other things.
[01:39:43.068 --> 01:39:44.469]  Little CIA command bases.
[01:39:45.834 --> 01:39:52.057]  You remember that story a month ago or so about them dumping a lot of dollars and getting their local currency coming up for the fall.
[01:39:52.557 --> 01:39:58.239]  That more and more looks like for the flu, a global flu pandemic in case they decide to go with that.
[01:39:58.359 --> 01:39:59.840]  Or is that something else, Bob Chapman?
[01:40:00.799 --> 01:40:16.085]  Well, I just interpreted it just a little while ago as being, and I said I backed into it, being that the dollar was going to fall and not be accepted as readily as they might like, and it probably will cause a crisis.
[01:40:16.705 --> 01:40:27.610]  And in an embassy, let's say in Munich, which is one of the ones that received this money, they galloped out and got rid of the dollars and bought Euros.
[01:40:28.479 --> 01:40:37.285]  And that's so that they would have a stash there in the local currency that would be accepted that they could continue to do the things that they have to do.
[01:40:38.466 --> 01:40:39.487]  That's my take on it.
[01:40:39.907 --> 01:40:40.567]  Yes, ma'am.
[01:40:40.688 --> 01:40:42.169]  I wouldn't put anything past them.
[01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:46.412]  They're clearly moving on all fronts to bring in the New World Order agenda.
[01:40:46.812 --> 01:40:56.539]  They're in high gear and so we have Department of Defense driving around the parking lot and FBI visiting and because the criminal takeover is happening
[01:40:57.509 --> 01:41:01.632]  And the banks are just totally riping the country.
[01:41:01.992 --> 01:41:06.115]  I mean, and they, let me tell you, I am a canary in the coal mine.
[01:41:06.135 --> 01:41:13.540]  If they come grab me for something, folks, you better just, you better just squeeze your butt cheeks together because they're coming after you.
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:14.040]  I'm sorry.
[01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:14.741]  I'm sorry.
[01:41:14.801 --> 01:41:15.821]  I'm out of control, folks.
[01:41:15.881 --> 01:41:19.664]  It's just, it's just that, it's just that this is really going on.
[01:41:19.684 --> 01:41:20.605]  This is really happening.
[01:41:21.785 --> 01:41:22.946]  That's pretty funny, isn't it, Bob?
[01:41:22.966 --> 01:41:25.067]  It's not going to get better.
[01:41:25.108 --> 01:41:27.069]  And I, I think that's what you're trying to say.
[01:41:27.668 --> 01:41:39.472]  And so please, please, please prepare yourself mentally, physically, and get your food, your dehydrated, freeze-dried food in your filter, and make sure you get plenty of clips and ammo.
[01:41:40.872 --> 01:41:42.793]  It's probably going to come down to that.
[01:41:43.633 --> 01:41:49.175]  And I hate to have to say that, but, you know, there's no... And they're like vampires.
[01:41:49.215 --> 01:41:52.776]  They look for any excuse to get you in their system like you've done something.
[01:41:53.237 --> 01:41:54.777]  Oh, you had a hair sticking up.
[01:41:54.817 --> 01:41:55.838]  You had a crooked toenail.
[01:41:56.258 --> 01:41:56.918]  Live in prison.
[01:41:58.956 --> 01:42:06.378]  Well, they are overreacting to crime, and when it's really not even crime.
[01:42:07.158 --> 01:42:10.739]  And, you know, here are the people like you and I who talk about the truth.
[01:42:11.099 --> 01:42:11.739]  We're terrorists!
[01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:13.060]  We're bad people!
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:14.700]  And of course, we're not.
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:17.681]  Well, I did show the FBI a Ron Paul sticker in the party line.
[01:42:17.721 --> 01:42:19.642]  I said, look, DHS report, terrorists.
[01:42:20.502 --> 01:42:21.562]  And they kind of went, yeah.
[01:42:22.202 --> 01:42:22.422]  Yeah.
[01:42:23.323 --> 01:42:24.663]  They kind of smiled downward.
[01:42:26.243 --> 01:42:28.244]  They should be ashamed of themselves.
[01:42:29.844 --> 01:42:33.408]  You know, that's the way my mom would put it if she was still alive.
[01:42:34.009 --> 01:42:38.453]  You know, because she was so for law and order, so to speak.
[01:42:39.214 --> 01:42:45.521]  And she would be so disappointed to see how our country's law enforcement has degenerated.
[01:42:45.601 --> 01:42:46.082]  It's awful.
[01:42:47.984 --> 01:42:54.213]  Take a few calls from Ronnie, Brian, Joel Keebler and others on the other side of this quick break.
[01:42:55.015 --> 01:43:00.843]  It is sick when me and Bob just start laughing, because I'm sitting here thinking about being drugged off to prison and I'm just laughing.
[01:43:00.863 --> 01:43:01.644]  It's so ridiculous.
[01:43:04.432 --> 01:43:07.714]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:43:07.874 --> 01:43:11.956]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:43:12.116 --> 01:43:23.562]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:43:23.782 --> 01:43:29.565]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:43:29.905 --> 01:43:30.186]  I'm good.
[01:43:50.928 --> 01:43:53.473]  Visit us today at utopiasilver.com.
[01:43:53.633 --> 01:43:56.358]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A-Silver dot com.
[01:43:56.538 --> 01:43:57.139]  Or call 888-213-4338.
[01:43:57.159 --> 01:43:57.219]  888-213-4338.
[01:43:57.239 --> 01:43:58.361]  And help us win this battle.
[01:44:04.827 --> 01:44:10.151]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:10.871 --> 01:44:16.195]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:44:16.756 --> 01:44:22.900]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:25.061]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:25.201 --> 01:44:27.602]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:44:27.682 --> 01:44:38.606]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:44:40.847 --> 01:44:42.148]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:42.528 --> 01:44:43.928]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:44:44.388 --> 01:44:50.631]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:51.292 --> 01:44:59.067]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:59.568 --> 01:45:00.710]  The Obama Deception.
[01:45:01.151 --> 01:45:02.333]  The people strike back!
[01:45:04.255 --> 01:45:05.496]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:45:05.557 --> 01:45:10.902]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:45:11.143 --> 01:45:15.768]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:45:16.168 --> 01:45:16.569]  It's true.
[01:45:16.649 --> 01:45:19.232]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:45:19.452 --> 01:45:21.194]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:45:21.730 --> 01:45:26.433]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:45:26.954 --> 01:45:28.875]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:45:29.275 --> 01:45:33.878]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:45:34.078 --> 01:45:34.979]  And here's the best part.
[01:45:35.199 --> 01:45:37.961]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:45:38.261 --> 01:45:41.563]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:45:41.884 --> 01:45:44.725]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:45:45.066 --> 01:45:46.967]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:45:47.307 --> 01:45:48.208]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:45:51.857 --> 01:45:53.618]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:45:54.818 --> 01:46:00.601]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:46:00.921 --> 01:46:03.342]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:46:06.043 --> 01:46:17.168]  We're going to find out who our surprise guest is here soon enough.
[01:46:35.054 --> 01:46:36.976]  Bob Chapman is our guest.
[01:46:37.076 --> 01:46:39.658]  Ronnie in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:46:39.738 --> 01:46:40.519]  Thank you for holding.
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:41.940]  Thank you, sir.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.042]  And I want to thank Mr. Chapman.
[01:46:44.082 --> 01:46:45.163]  I've got two ideas for you.
[01:46:45.243 --> 01:46:58.475]  One, actually I've been thinking for you too, I think, is to help you and this program and everyone else to keep laughing, use humor whenever you can because, and here's the key, it helps people want to remember what you say to them.
[01:46:59.002 --> 01:47:01.224]  Because humor, it's like a reward.
[01:47:01.244 --> 01:47:03.827]  And so, sharing joy with info is the key.
[01:47:03.867 --> 01:47:05.949]  I think it helps it sink in, whatever you're trying to do.
[01:47:05.969 --> 01:47:10.753]  I know, but when the tyranny is so sick and so obvious and so ridiculous, you start laughing.
[01:47:11.314 --> 01:47:12.655]  I mean, it's just sick.
[01:47:14.437 --> 01:47:17.000]  I mean, this world is just run by a bunch of scum.
[01:47:18.243 --> 01:47:20.364]  And the public's all dumbed down, but you know what?
[01:47:20.424 --> 01:47:22.385]  I shouldn't be negative, and I appreciate your call, Ronnie.
[01:47:22.826 --> 01:47:27.268]  The good news here, Bob, is we're up to almost 300 sponsors to end the Fed.
[01:47:27.288 --> 01:47:29.910]  The globalists are on the run on every front.
[01:47:30.270 --> 01:47:31.731]  They must be really getting scared.
[01:47:33.432 --> 01:47:33.992]  They should.
[01:47:36.714 --> 01:47:38.295]  We're formidable opponents.
[01:47:43.298 --> 01:47:44.618]  Oh, let's take another call here.
[01:47:44.658 --> 01:47:46.880]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Canada.
[01:47:47.984 --> 01:47:48.904]  Brian, go ahead.
[01:47:49.565 --> 01:47:50.025]  Hi, Alex.
[01:47:50.045 --> 01:47:50.485]  Hi, Bob.
[01:47:51.345 --> 01:47:51.806]  Hi, buddy.
[01:47:51.886 --> 01:47:55.147]  I just wanted to let you guys know up in Canada, yeah, it's the same thing.
[01:47:55.187 --> 01:47:56.747]  They say that the recession's over.
[01:47:57.608 --> 01:47:59.969]  You know, makes you wonder what kind of pills they're taking.
[01:48:00.869 --> 01:48:13.254]  But, yeah, you should stay positive, Alex, because if you go onto social networks like 12-160 and other places like that, people are well aware of what's going on, and they're making up their own contingency plans.
[01:48:13.274 --> 01:48:14.174]  They're communicating.
[01:48:14.194 --> 01:48:14.794]  They're talking.
[01:48:14.955 --> 01:48:16.015]  We're having a big effect.
[01:48:18.357 --> 01:48:22.380]  Bob, I was wondering if you don't think this is a mistake on their part, too.
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:29.504]  For years, we have the impression that they're under the control of everything, but that money is money, and money is normal and regular.
[01:48:30.085 --> 01:48:37.269]  And just recently, when they come up with their, let's say, prefabricated problems, they turned to us.
[01:48:37.349 --> 01:48:44.214]  They tried to take money from us, but when you saw them putting together the packages, you had a big resistance from the people.
[01:48:44.947 --> 01:48:51.029]  And so they kind of turned around and said, well, look, we're the ones who created the money anyway, so we can just create more.
[01:48:51.690 --> 01:48:53.831]  And this kind of tells the public, well, watch it.
[01:48:54.391 --> 01:49:03.254]  If you create the money and if you can make your own money at any time to get yourself out of your own problems, basically you don't need us and we don't have to put up with you anymore.
[01:49:03.794 --> 01:49:05.435]  It's kind of a mistake on their part.
[01:49:06.676 --> 01:49:07.976]  Well, I think you're absolutely right.
[01:49:08.056 --> 01:49:12.838]  And it's a very unusual, but a great way of explaining their problem.
[01:49:13.676 --> 01:49:16.017]  And it's a very sophisticated answer.
[01:49:16.737 --> 01:49:17.738]  And I thank you for it.
[01:49:18.138 --> 01:49:23.680]  I hadn't thought of it in those terms, but they underestimate people.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.202]  And there's a lot of very, very bright people throughout the entire world.
[01:49:28.082 --> 01:49:34.585]  And they think that they are far better than everybody else because they are in this elite group.
[01:49:35.225 --> 01:49:37.926]  And of course, they know better what's good for us than we do.
[01:49:39.048 --> 01:49:45.993]  And when they're met with formidable force, which they have many times before, they've lost at this a number of times.
[01:49:46.834 --> 01:49:50.677]  And the number of players along the way have been liquidated by different societies.
[01:49:51.277 --> 01:49:52.779]  And many of them have been banned.
[01:49:52.819 --> 01:49:55.340]  In the olden days, they used to ban people for doing this.
[01:49:56.902 --> 01:49:59.944]  Although today, I don't know where we could ban people to.
[01:50:00.484 --> 01:50:05.628]  But the point is that we are making a tremendous effect.
[01:50:06.089 --> 01:50:07.189]  We're making them react.
[01:50:08.464 --> 01:50:10.505]  We're telling everybody what they're doing.
[01:50:11.265 --> 01:50:23.609]  And in this environment where you have the layoffs and the drop in consumption, the problems in housing, and all of those things, people's minds are open.
[01:50:24.069 --> 01:50:25.690]  Alright, Bob, great having you on with us.
[01:50:25.710 --> 01:50:26.750]  I appreciate you coming on.
[01:50:27.751 --> 01:50:28.631]  Okay, see you next week.
[01:50:29.002 --> 01:50:30.824]  Alright, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:50:31.304 --> 01:50:34.767]  My website is InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:34.807 --> 01:50:35.908]  His issue comes out tomorrow.
[01:50:36.188 --> 01:50:37.149]  Be sure and check it out.
[01:50:37.549 --> 01:50:41.032]  Our surprise guest, coming up in just 70 seconds.
[01:50:45.556 --> 01:50:49.239]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:50:49.259 --> 01:50:50.940]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:53.706 --> 01:50:58.893]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:50:59.013 --> 01:51:03.399]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:51:03.539 --> 01:51:05.402]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:51:05.822 --> 01:51:07.184]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:51:07.444 --> 01:51:08.486]  There is a solution.
[01:51:08.706 --> 01:51:16.730]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:51:56.849 --> 01:51:58.770]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:59.230 --> 01:52:01.992]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:52:10.535 --> 01:52:13.516]  Well, it's the final hour of this Friday edition.
[01:52:13.576 --> 01:52:15.577]  Blasting out on the Hammond-Edmund Dial.
[01:52:15.717 --> 01:52:19.198]  Shortwave, XM radio, and the Internet.
[01:52:19.278 --> 01:52:27.601]  And, uh, for the rest of the hour, we're very honored to be joined by Harrison Hagen-Schmidt, or Jack Schmidt.
[01:52:28.622 --> 01:52:34.264]  And, uh, he's an American geologist, former NASA astronaut, university professor, and a U.S.
[01:52:34.304 --> 01:52:35.424]  Senator for one term.
[01:52:35.504 --> 01:52:39.606]  He is the last of the Apollo astronauts to arrive and set foot on the Moon.
[01:52:41.215 --> 01:52:42.897]  And he took some of the most famous photos.
[01:52:42.937 --> 01:52:44.079]  The bio goes on and on.
[01:52:44.099 --> 01:52:46.962]  We'll talk about some of that while he's on with us.
[01:52:48.083 --> 01:52:53.850]  But, the main reason he's on today, and we're very honored to have him,
[01:52:55.112 --> 01:53:00.497]  ...is that he has been very outspoken, thank God, against global warming being man-made.
[01:53:00.857 --> 01:53:15.631]  We've had a lot of climatologists and a lot of researchers and sunspot experts in all these different fields, and 37,000 of them sent letters a few months ago to the House of Representatives, and they wouldn't even let them testify.
[01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:24.513]  The media ignored them and then they used a few thousand scientists on the UN payroll to say we've got to totally change our way of life.
[01:53:24.833 --> 01:53:26.574]  Carbon dioxide is a deadly poison.
[01:53:26.594 --> 01:53:36.698]  It's a national security issue and astronaut Jack Schmidt has spoken out against that with his scientific training in PhD in geology from Harvard University.
[01:53:37.618 --> 01:53:40.959]  And all his other scientific research and the bio goes on and on.
[01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:47.422]  And he reportedly took the famous photo of the marble, you know, blue marble of the Earth from the Moon.
[01:53:47.862 --> 01:53:49.062]  And so it's pretty neat to have him on.
[01:53:49.082 --> 01:53:51.463]  We're going to break in a few minutes, but let's go ahead and introduce him.
[01:53:51.763 --> 01:53:53.164]  It's great to have you on, Mr. Schmidt.
[01:53:53.524 --> 01:53:56.505]  It's my pleasure and privilege to be with you today.
[01:53:57.745 --> 01:54:00.366]  I was flattered to learn that you've actually heard of the show before.
[01:54:01.127 --> 01:54:01.547]  Oh yeah.
[01:54:02.727 --> 01:54:04.308]  We try to keep track out here.
[01:54:06.138 --> 01:54:07.518]  Well, Mr. Schmidt, it's great to have you.
[01:54:07.978 --> 01:54:11.679]  Let's just launch into man-made global warming.
[01:54:11.699 --> 01:54:16.960]  I mean, they were growing grapes thousands of years ago in Britain, but they're not now.
[01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:23.621]  All the evidence shows it gets hotter and colder, and Mars' ice caps get smaller, and then they get bigger.
[01:54:23.641 --> 01:54:24.602]  They're getting bigger again.
[01:54:24.622 --> 01:54:26.842]  Isn't it the sun, or am I wrong?
[01:54:27.502 --> 01:54:30.903]  Well, all the evidence is that there's a solar connection.
[01:54:31.003 --> 01:54:32.103]  The amplification
[01:54:33.285 --> 01:54:33.645]  I don't know.
[01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:26.105]  Now, how small variations in solar irradiance are amplified into significant changes in ocean temperature, significant changes in atmospheric temperature, global cloud cover, and the like, is still, I would have to say, in the realm of hypotheses rather than theory.
[01:55:27.105 --> 01:55:30.606]  However, there's a very good hypothesis, and that is that
[01:55:31.787 --> 01:55:43.296]  It's the solar magnetic fields that vary with solar irradiance that are really determining the flux of cosmic rays into the atmosphere and therefore the amount of clouds that form.
[01:55:44.256 --> 01:55:46.038]  And they're forming what, the nuclei?
[01:55:46.658 --> 01:55:59.248]  Yeah, they form when they interact with molecules of oxygen and nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere, you develop charged particles that then
[01:56:00.232 --> 01:56:03.853]  attract water vapor and become the nucleus for cloud formation.
[01:56:04.453 --> 01:56:14.576]  And when the sun is relatively inactive, for example, like it is right now, then the magnetic fields that protect us from cosmic rays are depressed.
[01:56:15.316 --> 01:56:24.538]  And you get more cosmic ray interaction with the atmosphere, more clouds, and therefore the clouds reflect more sunlight, and you end up with a cooling trend.
[01:56:25.158 --> 01:56:27.179]  And we've had that, as most people in
[01:56:28.439 --> 01:56:32.463]  The Northern Hemisphere at least now realized we've had that for almost 10 years.
[01:56:33.404 --> 01:56:40.070]  You may have noted that there was a recent announcement that I guess that Dalgora's hometown in Tennessee has had its coldest
[01:56:41.285 --> 01:56:42.766]  A year on record so far.
[01:56:42.866 --> 01:56:44.266]  Yes, there's been a lot of record.
[01:56:44.907 --> 01:56:45.707]  But not just that.
[01:56:45.827 --> 01:56:55.631]  Then the Al Gore people have been caught faking buoys and other weather stations, faking higher temperatures the last few years.
[01:56:56.391 --> 01:56:58.852]  Our guest is also the author of Return to the Moon.
[01:56:59.332 --> 01:57:00.412]  He's Harrison Schmitt.
[01:57:00.452 --> 01:57:01.453]  We're very honored to have him.
[01:57:02.313 --> 01:57:03.594]  He is an astronaut.
[01:57:03.974 --> 01:57:08.957]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:57:09.177 --> 01:57:12.979]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:57:13.199 --> 01:57:18.823]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:57:19.103 --> 01:57:23.965]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:57:24.166 --> 01:57:24.686]  Number three,
[01:57:25.086 --> 01:57:30.528]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:57:31.388 --> 01:57:34.029]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:57:34.269 --> 01:57:37.690]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:42.411]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:57:42.651 --> 01:57:48.133]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:57:48.373 --> 01:57:52.935]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:58:03.683 --> 01:58:04.764]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:58:05.044 --> 01:58:06.846]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:58:07.046 --> 01:58:07.706]  Well, you should.
[01:58:08.027 --> 01:58:12.290]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:58:12.531 --> 01:58:13.011]  That's right.
[01:58:13.331 --> 01:58:21.799]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[01:58:21.999 --> 01:58:23.260]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:24.501]  Plus, if you act fast.
[01:58:24.701 --> 01:58:30.327]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD Pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:58:30.667 --> 01:58:37.214]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:58:37.575 --> 01:58:41.279]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or
[01:58:41.459 --> 01:58:41.699]  We're good.
[01:59:04.206 --> 01:59:05.966]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[01:59:06.247 --> 01:59:08.967]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[01:59:09.187 --> 01:59:11.108]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[01:59:11.428 --> 01:59:12.188]  Here's the story.
[01:59:12.408 --> 01:59:16.990]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[01:59:17.210 --> 01:59:18.230]  Now here's the bad news.
[01:59:18.450 --> 01:59:23.291]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures.
[01:59:23.531 --> 01:59:25.372]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[01:59:25.652 --> 01:59:29.873]  Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[01:59:30.253 --> 01:59:35.454]  All this is creating a perfect storm, which could create unimaginable shortages in the healthcare services.
[01:59:35.774 --> 01:59:37.615]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[01:59:37.955 --> 01:59:46.657]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[01:59:46.977 --> 01:59:51.861]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[01:59:52.142 --> 01:59:56.065]  I recommend you visit this important new website at MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[01:59:56.265 --> 02:00:00.128]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[02:00:00.329 --> 02:00:10.697]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:14.622 --> 02:00:29.546]  Well, we're really lucky today for the rest of the hour to have Dr. Harrison Schmitt, Jack Schmitt, American geologist, former NASA astronaut, university professor and former U.S.
[02:00:29.586 --> 02:00:34.987]  Senator, and he also, of course, walked on the moon on Apollo 17.
[02:00:35.267 --> 02:00:39.388]  And don't worry, we're going to talk about that before he leaves us today.
[02:00:39.468 --> 02:00:43.089]  But the big crisis at hand is the hoax, the
[02:00:44.429 --> 02:00:47.412]  The manufactured crisis of global warming.
[02:00:47.432 --> 02:00:49.073]  And I have Club of Rome documents, all that.
[02:00:49.093 --> 02:00:49.834]  We'll go over it with him.
[02:00:50.214 --> 02:00:57.440]  Where they admit this is just their pretext to turn us into the Soviet Union and micromanage the entire carbon cycle.
[02:00:57.780 --> 02:01:10.311]  But I guess a lot of people out there aren't biologists or aren't geologists and don't understand this, but he's here with us today to go over the science of that because he's bravely, because you get branded a heretic, come out against this hoax.
[02:01:10.951 --> 02:01:23.681]  And so, Dr. Smith, again, let's continue going into why you decided to go public and start talking about this whole carbon tax and the science behind supposed man-made global warming.
[02:01:25.423 --> 02:01:38.253]  Well, the primary reason that I and thousands of other observers of nature, if you will, I'm a field geologist, have become more active is our
[02:01:39.429 --> 02:01:40.029]  It's two-fold.
[02:01:40.329 --> 02:01:56.013]  One is that we are concerned about the misuse of science, and particularly the misuse of modeling of a very complex system called climate that is so complex that it really can't be done.
[02:01:56.833 --> 02:02:05.755]  In fact, there are many people who are experts in modeling, astrophysicists and others, that have said the same thing.
[02:02:05.815 --> 02:02:07.155]  Freeman Dyson, for example.
[02:02:08.104 --> 02:02:08.925]  I don't think so.
[02:02:20.987 --> 02:02:21.067]  Yes.
[02:02:44.557 --> 02:02:50.398]  Based predictions of the future on these extremely complex models that are filled with assumptions.
[02:02:50.438 --> 02:02:54.759]  So that, number one, we've been concerned about the misuse of science.
[02:02:55.979 --> 02:03:12.163]  But I think more fundamentally, this misuse of science has led to politicians and ideologues to try to gain control of the American economy.
[02:03:13.058 --> 02:03:16.820]  And indeed, the global economy, by scaring people.
[02:03:18.301 --> 02:03:28.026]  Now, the science is quite clear that there has been, since 1660, about a half a degree warming every hundred years.
[02:03:28.866 --> 02:03:40.332]  That is a natural cycle that represents the Earth coming out of what was called the Little Ice Age, an extremely cold period for the Earth.
[02:03:41.289 --> 02:03:45.611]  Uh, back in the, uh, beginning about, uh, 1400.
[02:03:45.751 --> 02:03:59.797]  Uh, that's, uh, if you want to read some of the history of the American Revolutionary War, uh, you will realize, like the book Sam Adams by McCullough, you realize how damn cold it was back then.
[02:04:00.117 --> 02:04:07.320]  And that was partly that we were just moving out of the Little Ice Age very slowly, and it was still very cold.
[02:04:08.569 --> 02:04:25.820]  And so the natural warming is clearly happening, but there is absolutely no observational evidence whatsoever that the increase in carbon dioxide that has been measured in the last 50 years has had anything to do with that.
[02:04:27.521 --> 02:04:33.144]  Primarily because the warming started before the Industrial Revolution ever began.
[02:04:33.976 --> 02:04:36.218]  Now, where is that carbon dioxide coming from?
[02:04:36.238 --> 02:04:41.384]  Well, it's probably coming mostly out of the oceans, because the oceans are getting warmer.
[02:04:42.105 --> 02:04:51.535]  There's a lag in that process of the oceans giving up carbon dioxide as they warm, but nevertheless, and it can be a lag of a few centuries,
[02:04:52.170 --> 02:04:57.092]  But nevertheless, that's probably where most of that rise in CO2 is coming from.
[02:04:57.492 --> 02:05:09.516]  Well, we're talking to Dr. Harrison Schmitt, Jack Schmitt, one of the Apollo astronauts, walked to the moon, took the most famous photo, one of the most famous photos ever of the moon and the little blue marble out there.
[02:05:09.536 --> 02:05:10.577]  We're going to talk about that later.
[02:05:12.127 --> 02:05:13.147]  You're a doctor in this.
[02:05:13.227 --> 02:05:22.829]  I'm just one who studies it and interviews scientists and people, but Al Gore got caught, according to all the ice core samples and people that I've interviewed and seen on television.
[02:05:23.549 --> 02:05:35.911]  He put the two, the carbon dioxide going up with the warming, when really the carbon dioxide comes after the warming, as you just said, that's from all the governments, all the universities, all the ocean studies, ice cores, correct?
[02:05:36.431 --> 02:05:39.292]  So that's more cooking the books, and then they've also caught
[02:05:40.632 --> 02:05:40.832]  Well,
[02:06:08.755 --> 02:06:12.396]  It is being used fraudulently, there's no question about it.
[02:06:13.677 --> 02:06:19.639]  And it's being used for political purposes, and hopefully the American people have started to realize that.
[02:06:20.179 --> 02:06:31.783]  Certainly there are surveys that indicate that the common sense of the American people on climate change is starting to take hold, as it apparently is on health care revisions and
[02:06:32.682 --> 02:06:55.252]  The stimulus, so-called stimulus package, where there is a concerted effort in the new administration and the Congress that's supporting them, and what one might call a state-run media to support them, to move this country in directions that increase government control of just about every major facet of our lives.
[02:06:57.521 --> 02:06:58.161]  Absolutely.
[02:06:58.181 --> 02:07:04.223]  You know, they wouldn't let anybody see 300 pages of the 1300-page bill until right when they voted on it.
[02:07:04.243 --> 02:07:05.003]  Now we have it.
[02:07:05.604 --> 02:07:10.565]  Home inspections, federal power to kick you out of your house if they want, take over all the land.
[02:07:10.585 --> 02:07:17.147]  It allows 30-plus federal agencies to just levy taxes and fines outside Congress's power.
[02:07:17.207 --> 02:07:26.390]  It's kind of a letter of mark just being given to any agency or group to go out and piratically shake down the public.
[02:07:28.254 --> 02:07:30.776]  Well, it's not encouraging.
[02:07:30.836 --> 02:07:44.606]  Liberty is definitely threatened in this current political environment, and all of us who believe in liberty are going to have to begin to take steps to counter it.
[02:07:44.626 --> 02:07:53.612]  And it's encouraging to see the governors and the legislatures of a few states starting to push back in terms of gaining a
[02:07:56.426 --> 02:08:06.688]  Uh, a founder's interpretation of the 10th Amendment, namely that amendment that leaves everything not enumerated in the Constitution, uh, to the authority of the private sector or the state.
[02:08:07.908 --> 02:08:20.591]  Uh, and so, uh, that, that is, I think, a very, very encouraging trend, and I certainly hope that they'll continue in that direction to at least try to put the brakes on, uh, the legal brakes, the constitutional brakes on what happens.
[02:08:22.995 --> 02:08:23.976]  Well, I think you're right.
[02:08:23.996 --> 02:08:25.497]  I mean, the polls show you're right.
[02:08:25.977 --> 02:08:42.330]  That people are finally, you know, they've gone from 60 plus percent a few years ago believing man-made global warming was this big threat and we were all dead and carbon dioxide was deadly poison and would kill you in seconds, to now realizing that it is a fraud and a hoax and just a new tax.
[02:08:43.131 --> 02:08:46.533]  Now they've only got about 40 percent support and that's imploding quickly.
[02:08:46.994 --> 02:08:50.817]  But it seems like the federal government, and as you said, the state-controlled media, the big corporate media,
[02:08:51.517 --> 02:08:54.599]  They want this new tax, they want this control, and they don't care.
[02:08:54.619 --> 02:08:56.980]  It looks like they're going to just ram it through, maybe.
[02:08:58.361 --> 02:08:59.822]  Well, we'll see.
[02:09:00.843 --> 02:09:12.550]  There's a lot of resistance that's pushed back now, and the August recess could help us, as the common sense of the American people is put forward to their representatives.
[02:09:12.650 --> 02:09:16.512]  And we'll just see how we come out of this particular period.
[02:09:17.633 --> 02:09:20.134]  You mentioned the corporate media.
[02:09:20.375 --> 02:09:20.835]  I would not
[02:09:21.377 --> 02:09:25.120]  I don't necessarily blame it on being corporate media.
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:31.726]  It's just media that's in the tank for this socialistic change in our political system.
[02:09:32.827 --> 02:09:47.479]  And it's because just about everybody in the media now, reporters, analysts and otherwise, have come out of an elementary, secondary and college education.
[02:09:48.562 --> 02:09:53.605]  That has been dominated by people who have less respect for liberty than you are not.
[02:09:54.866 --> 02:09:55.447]  Well, yes, sir.
[02:09:55.467 --> 02:09:59.269]  Again, we're talking to astronaut, Apollo astronaut, Dr. Schmidt.
[02:10:00.410 --> 02:10:06.374]  My point was Rex Tillerson at ExxonMobil said, look, we've looked at this.
[02:10:06.394 --> 02:10:07.875]  This is just a tax on oil.
[02:10:08.655 --> 02:10:09.516]  This is a fraud.
[02:10:09.796 --> 02:10:13.879]  And then David Rockefeller, the majority owner at a board meeting, this was in the news, said, you're going to
[02:10:14.778 --> 02:10:15.838]  Come out and say it's real.
[02:10:16.279 --> 02:10:18.960]  And so even Rex Tillerson came out and said, OK, it's real.
[02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:27.544]  So when you see the NFL and every other big organization pushing it, when in the American Football League is the National Football League is pushing it.
[02:10:28.064 --> 02:10:29.725]  We know the establishments behind it.
[02:10:30.025 --> 02:10:33.746]  Are you saying that that's just the incredible peer pressure and hype?
[02:10:34.767 --> 02:10:39.329]  Or is some scientists are saying this is the new global religion?
[02:10:39.389 --> 02:10:41.290]  This is the new organizing force.
[02:10:42.591 --> 02:10:55.882]  Well, it has certain characteristics of a religion in that there's a great amount of faith that the climate modelers have the right answer.
[02:10:57.403 --> 02:11:10.293]  But it is also, I think, related to a much longer-term ideological battle that's been going on far before climate change came along.
[02:11:11.887 --> 02:11:37.212]  It's an ideological battle of those that believe that you should maximize human liberty under certain guidelines, such as our Constitution, and those who feel that you should give up human liberty for a variety of their particular ideological reasons.
[02:11:38.663 --> 02:11:39.864]  Well, I agree with you, Dr. Schmidt.
[02:11:39.884 --> 02:11:40.504]  We're about to break.
[02:11:40.524 --> 02:11:44.406]  We'll come back, get into some other issues as well, like health care with you.
[02:11:44.646 --> 02:11:49.249]  Then, of course, get into the moon itself and what it's like to be an astronaut who's been off the planet.
[02:11:52.471 --> 02:11:56.793]  I guess you're amongst people who've been the farthest away from the Earth of anybody else in the world.
[02:11:57.814 --> 02:12:00.275]  I know your mission was supposedly there the longest, right?
[02:12:00.295 --> 02:12:02.817]  If I'm not quoting that wrong.
[02:12:04.002 --> 02:12:08.305]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[02:12:08.525 --> 02:12:10.947]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[02:12:11.087 --> 02:12:20.614]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[02:12:20.774 --> 02:12:26.661]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[02:12:26.962 --> 02:12:29.465]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[02:12:29.665 --> 02:12:39.397]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[02:12:39.777 --> 02:12:50.183]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[02:12:50.343 --> 02:12:54.286]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[02:12:54.366 --> 02:12:57.207]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[02:12:57.367 --> 02:13:00.969]  It takes very little money and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[02:13:01.129 --> 02:13:03.611]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[02:13:06.107 --> 02:13:07.148]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:13:07.549 --> 02:13:13.055]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:13:13.615 --> 02:13:14.116]  That's right.
[02:13:14.436 --> 02:13:16.719]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:13:17.279 --> 02:13:24.207]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:13:24.767 --> 02:13:30.448]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs.
[02:13:30.468 --> 02:13:32.449]  You get no word about IRAs.
[02:13:32.889 --> 02:13:37.750]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:13:38.370 --> 02:13:43.372]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:13:44.172 --> 02:13:48.273]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:13:48.693 --> 02:13:48.973]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:13:48.993 --> 02:13:50.875]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:13:50.955 --> 02:13:51.255]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:13:51.556 --> 02:13:51.816]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:14:04.955 --> 02:14:10.277]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:14:10.997 --> 02:14:16.338]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:14:16.879 --> 02:14:23.060]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:25.181]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:14:25.341 --> 02:14:27.722]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:14:27.802 --> 02:14:31.803]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists,
[02:14:32.083 --> 02:14:37.548]  Who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs.
[02:14:38.008 --> 02:14:38.749]  That's fascist.
[02:14:40.991 --> 02:14:42.272]  It's not about left or right.
[02:14:42.652 --> 02:14:44.073]  It's about a one world government.
[02:14:44.514 --> 02:14:50.739]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:14:51.405 --> 02:14:59.200]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:14:59.681 --> 02:15:00.823]  The Obama Deception.
[02:15:01.264 --> 02:15:02.466]  The people strike back!
[02:15:03.988 --> 02:15:13.117]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[02:15:13.277 --> 02:15:21.286]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[02:15:21.766 --> 02:15:25.947]  First, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[02:15:26.007 --> 02:15:28.627]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[02:15:28.767 --> 02:15:40.070]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[02:15:40.350 --> 02:15:46.531]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Freshwater Organics.
[02:15:46.771 --> 02:15:50.492]  FPP strengthens skin, hair, and bones, lowers cholesterol, and is an
[02:15:50.652 --> 02:15:54.275]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was having an amazing conversation just now with Dr. Schmidt.
[02:16:16.630 --> 02:16:17.671]  Apollo astronaut.
[02:16:17.691 --> 02:16:20.092]  We're going to get into all the space stuff in the next segment.
[02:16:20.592 --> 02:16:27.616]  And I brought up to him, Ecoscience, Population, Resources and Environment, by John P. Holdren, the White House
[02:16:29.483 --> 02:16:35.425]  Science czar, the guy that wants global warming taxes and to terraform the earth with particulate to save us.
[02:16:35.485 --> 02:16:36.925]  I mean, this is wild stuff.
[02:16:36.945 --> 02:16:40.607]  I mean, here's the Wall Street Journal saying they want to chemtrail us.
[02:16:40.667 --> 02:16:42.707]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[02:16:43.767 --> 02:16:47.089]  Sir, we were talking during the break, what do you liken this to?
[02:16:47.129 --> 02:16:50.450]  This saying, drug the water supply, sterilize the men and women.
[02:16:50.490 --> 02:16:54.551]  He says in this book, take all the children at birth and raise them
[02:16:55.291 --> 02:17:01.856]  Well, I think that there are individuals, apparently among them, a very large number, who have taken
[02:17:25.233 --> 02:17:36.277]  Shall we say captured the environmental movement and turned it into what previously was considered a communist movement.
[02:17:37.397 --> 02:17:48.621]  And that's just something that people of common sense are going to have to continue to counter and wake up enough so that they take control of their government again.
[02:17:50.362 --> 02:17:53.623]  It certainly is extremely important that the United States
[02:17:54.794 --> 02:17:59.495]  Uh, maintain itself as the beacon of liberty on this planet.
[02:18:00.376 --> 02:18:12.379]  Uh, there are all sorts of issues, space is included in that, where, uh, if we are not, uh, taking a leadership role in preserving liberty, uh, then it will disappear.
[02:18:13.059 --> 02:18:21.962]  Because, uh, other nations, uh, have so far tolerated, uh, a, uh, a continued attack on liberty
[02:18:22.751 --> 02:18:27.562]  That has been going on now certainly since the turn of the century.
[02:18:34.734 --> 02:18:35.134]  Absolutely.
[02:18:35.595 --> 02:18:38.536]  I mean, Doctor, you're obviously very well read on just the current news.
[02:18:38.836 --> 02:18:48.922]  I'm sure you've seen the announcements where they're saying, oh, we're going to have a new Bank of the World, you're going to pay your carbon taxes, a new world order.
[02:18:49.462 --> 02:18:55.366]  Al Gore called for a world government two weeks ago to, quote, administer the environmental movement.
[02:18:55.706 --> 02:18:57.547]  I mean, clearly that's what Holdren says.
[02:18:57.607 --> 02:19:02.509]  He says a planetary government to micromanage and reduce our numbers by at least 80 percent
[02:19:05.652 --> 02:19:06.953]  What is your view on that?
[02:19:07.233 --> 02:19:09.414]  And when you were in government as a U.S.
[02:19:09.454 --> 02:19:12.156]  Senator, did you ever hear any talk like this?
[02:19:12.256 --> 02:19:14.337]  Or is this starting to gain steam now?
[02:19:15.038 --> 02:19:17.459]  I think it has been gaining steam.
[02:19:18.100 --> 02:19:26.925]  You saw a little of it in my time in the Senate back in the late 70s and early 80s.
[02:19:27.406 --> 02:19:34.550]  Partisanship was beginning to really raise its ugly head more extensively than ever, at least in modern times.
[02:19:36.505 --> 02:19:54.877]  But it has clearly taken off in recent decades, I think primarily because of the capture of the government school system by the opponents of liberty.
[02:19:56.318 --> 02:19:59.900]  And that is, I think, the fundamental reason why we are today.
[02:20:02.278 --> 02:20:10.740]  Does that mean that common sense has totally disappeared from the American people due to the education and the elementary and secondary school system?
[02:20:12.060 --> 02:20:20.141]  I don't think so, because you still see, particularly in current surveys, a great deal of common sense reappearing.
[02:20:21.062 --> 02:20:27.583]  But on the other hand, that has to be sufficient to take back control of the government.
[02:20:27.643 --> 02:20:29.163]  We let ourselves be lulled
[02:20:29.910 --> 02:20:53.194]  a sweep in the last election cycle, the last two election cycles, until all of a sudden we have a president and a majority in both houses of Congress that think identically about these matters and are willing to try to force down our throat a further erosion of American liberty.
[02:20:53.734 --> 02:20:57.155]  I notice, Dr. Smith... Even with the
[02:20:58.241 --> 02:21:02.565]  Decimation of our government run school system.
[02:21:03.646 --> 02:21:11.133]  I think the American people are showing human common sense and saying, hey, this isn't going to work.
[02:21:11.654 --> 02:21:14.616]  It never has and it won't work in the future unless we fix it.
[02:21:15.157 --> 02:21:19.641]  So we'll just have to continue to see if that common sense will prevail.
[02:21:20.401 --> 02:21:24.723]  Well, how obvious is it that all these other countries don't have to make carbon cuts?
[02:21:24.743 --> 02:21:31.226]  I mean, even if you believe in global warming and carbon dioxide is deadly, which is ridiculous, and they're trying to list it as a toxic waste.
[02:21:32.296 --> 02:21:38.240]  If we make the cuts, the businesses will just move to China and India and Mexico, and it'll boost carbon.
[02:21:38.680 --> 02:21:40.801]  I mean, it's just ridiculous any way you slice it.
[02:21:41.021 --> 02:21:46.865]  I want to get your take on that, Dr. Schmidt, Apollo astronaut on the other side, and we'll get into space technology.
[02:21:46.885 --> 02:21:47.826]  Should we go to the moon?
[02:21:48.086 --> 02:21:48.746]  Go to Mars?
[02:21:49.186 --> 02:21:49.867]  What's next?
[02:21:50.387 --> 02:21:52.028]  Why haven't we gone back in 40 years?
[02:21:52.448 --> 02:21:52.889]  Stay with us.
[02:21:54.470 --> 02:21:55.370]  We're on the march.
[02:21:55.851 --> 02:21:57.472]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:21:58.392 --> 02:22:01.074]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:03.916 --> 02:22:05.497]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:22:05.617 --> 02:22:10.259]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:22:10.339 --> 02:22:13.100]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:22:13.300 --> 02:22:16.141]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:22:16.341 --> 02:22:21.063]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:22:21.283 --> 02:22:22.203]  If you simply prepare.
[02:22:22.423 --> 02:22:25.345]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:22:25.665 --> 02:22:32.548]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:22:32.648 --> 02:22:35.769]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[02:22:53.080 --> 02:22:54.901]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:23:03.530 --> 02:23:08.697]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:23:08.837 --> 02:23:13.203]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:23:13.363 --> 02:23:15.226]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:23:15.646 --> 02:23:17.008]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:23:17.268 --> 02:23:18.310]  There is a solution.
[02:23:18.530 --> 02:23:26.555]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:24:03.882 --> 02:24:06.445]  Most Americans know the significance of July 4th, 1776.
[02:24:08.007 --> 02:24:15.777]  However, few know the importance of September 17th, 1787, the day the Constitution was written and adopted by our founders.
[02:24:16.117 --> 02:24:22.545]  Unfortunately, over 200 years later, this sacred document is under attack, along with our beloved Republic.
[02:24:22.785 --> 02:24:29.472]  Throughout the span of history, brave men and women have rallied behind banners which have served as symbols of liberty against the forces of tyranny.
[02:24:29.912 --> 02:24:40.804]  Today, we have the Constitution Pride Flag to show our support for the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, freedom, liberty, and justice for we the people of the United States.

[02:25:10.857 --> 02:25:11.497]  to 3 p.m.
[02:25:11.537 --> 02:25:12.438]  Central Standard Time.
[02:25:12.478 --> 02:25:12.878]  We're here.
[02:25:12.918 --> 02:25:15.939]  I come back Sundays, abbreviated live show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:25:16.379 --> 02:25:17.480]  Central Standard Time.
[02:25:18.540 --> 02:25:23.563]  And parts of the show are re-aired on XM Radio and a lot of other A&M affiliates across the country.
[02:25:23.943 --> 02:25:26.364]  We're very thankful to all those great affiliates out there.
[02:25:27.304 --> 02:25:30.546]  We're talking to Harrison Hagen-Schmidt, or Jack Smith.
[02:25:31.468 --> 02:25:35.451]  He's an American geologist, former NASA astronaut, university professor, and former U.S.
[02:25:35.491 --> 02:25:35.811]  Senator.
[02:25:35.831 --> 02:25:39.534]  He is the last of the Apollo astronauts to arrive and set foot on the moon.
[02:25:41.184 --> 02:25:47.887]  And he is also the first and so far only person to have walked on the moon who has never been a member of the United States Armed Forces.
[02:25:48.888 --> 02:25:51.889]  Neil Armstrong left military service, and then it just goes through some of that trivia.
[02:25:52.370 --> 02:25:58.733]  And he's got a book, Return to the Moon, that's up on screen in the Human Settlement of Space.
[02:25:58.913 --> 02:26:01.354]  Return to the Moon is the name of the book.
[02:26:01.374 --> 02:26:03.856]  You can find it at Amazon and bookstores everywhere.
[02:26:03.916 --> 02:26:05.296]  In fact, I've even seen it in the bookstore.
[02:26:05.756 --> 02:26:06.997]  I've even seen it at my dad's house.
[02:26:07.017 --> 02:26:10.199]  But the point is, great book, be sure and get that.
[02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:30.575]  Just to modify one thing you said, I was the only non-military trained pilot to go to the moon, but I did receive outstanding training from the United States Air Force in jet aircraft and the United States Navy in helicopters.
[02:26:30.655 --> 02:26:34.038]  So I feel like I sort of had the best of all worlds.
[02:26:34.431 --> 02:26:35.292]  Well there you go.
[02:26:35.432 --> 02:26:41.838]  I keep telling my guys don't print me Wikipedia stuff because Wikipedia's got my name spelled wrong and half of it's not true about me.
[02:26:43.100 --> 02:26:47.604]  I hope your audience recognizes that Wikipedia has their biases as well.
[02:26:48.245 --> 02:26:54.871]  Trying to get anything in there to moderate their position on climate change is impossible.
[02:26:54.931 --> 02:26:57.534]  A number of people have tried to do it and it just doesn't happen.
[02:26:58.590 --> 02:27:03.472]  I was just joking too, it's actually not from Wikipedia, the guys are about to box me in the nose in there.
[02:27:04.212 --> 02:27:22.238]  Yeah, Wikipedia won't let you publish, I've talked to scientists who've tried, any material basically trying to debunk man-made global warming in just one case I found, and it's just despicable because they're the first thing that comes up with almost any scientific inquiry.
[02:27:22.258 --> 02:27:23.119]  Have you noticed that, Doctor?
[02:27:25.371 --> 02:27:29.373]  Yeah, well, Google's in that game as well, you know.
[02:27:30.214 --> 02:27:33.656]  The head of Google has a very close relationship with the President.
[02:27:36.017 --> 02:27:36.818]  I have seen that.
[02:27:37.398 --> 02:27:52.327]  Now, I want to get a little bit more into the environmental movement and then into the moon and the time we have left with you and also health care, but dealing with Holdren's book and all these other books written by people that just cram the universities and academia and social planning
[02:27:53.679 --> 02:28:21.509]  uh... this this this talk about the world being overpopulated when the west is actually as you know as a huge decline in its actual and uh... indigenous numbers and dealing with this whole eugenics movement this whole idea of the super race i can't think of anybody out there who would be the the archetypal superman if it isn't the astronauts uh... i mean did they ever talk to you guys about this type of stuff for when you were in the u.s.
[02:28:21.629 --> 02:28:21.949]  senate
[02:28:22.669 --> 02:28:24.930]  You said it seems to be building more steam now.
[02:28:25.951 --> 02:28:29.133]  Holdren and these guys are talking about forced abortions.
[02:28:29.173 --> 02:28:31.814]  Just this whole move towards eugenics.
[02:28:32.655 --> 02:28:33.775]  Are you concerned about that?
[02:28:35.216 --> 02:28:40.939]  Well, I'm concerned about any movement that might have legs to it.
[02:28:40.999 --> 02:28:46.623]  But I really think it is more visible now because
[02:28:48.297 --> 02:28:52.461]  The people who think this way have gained power.
[02:28:53.742 --> 02:28:59.867]  It does not mean that they are going to be supported by the vast majority of the American people.
[02:28:59.987 --> 02:29:08.094]  I just think you have to continue as the Founders did, to put your faith in the people and in their common sense.
[02:29:08.174 --> 02:29:14.780]  Now, thanks to talk radio, they are getting some education that they would not have gotten
[02:29:15.963 --> 02:29:32.556]  Otherwise, and it's up to you guys to expand your market and to make sure that the American people overall begin to understand why their common sense is what they should rely on and not on what they're told by the national media, the state-run media, so to speak.
[02:29:33.516 --> 02:29:44.665]  Now, I think the whole trend really began with the fall of the Soviet Union, because the great champion of
[02:29:46.395 --> 02:29:58.018]  of the opponents of liberty, namely communism, had to find some other place to go, and they basically went into the environmental movement.
[02:29:58.058 --> 02:30:13.882]  Now, that's not to say there aren't some major and significant environmental issues, particularly at the local level, but they converted environmental activism to a political movement, and some would say a religious movement.
[02:30:14.121 --> 02:30:17.324]  Yeah, and really what these are is parasites.
[02:30:17.344 --> 02:30:19.805]  I mean, they want to organize our lives, they want to run our lives.
[02:30:20.066 --> 02:30:26.471]  I'll never forget back in the mid-90s, they were stealing farmers' and ranchers' land in and around Austin in the name of environmentalism.
[02:30:26.491 --> 02:30:28.752]  They later built on it and sold it to themselves.
[02:30:28.773 --> 02:30:30.234]  They were just bank robbers, criminals.
[02:30:30.754 --> 02:30:36.976]  And I remember being in a meeting with these city council advisors and I said, this isn't freedom, and they said, everything's a planned economy.
[02:30:37.476 --> 02:30:38.796]  You know, somebody's got to do it.
[02:30:39.116 --> 02:30:42.097]  I mean, they really think it's their job to run our lives.
[02:30:42.437 --> 02:30:44.598]  How do we beat the forces of tyranny?
[02:30:45.518 --> 02:30:47.138]  Well, you have to do it by education.
[02:30:47.939 --> 02:30:55.221]  And by reminding the American people that their basic common sense instincts are correct.
[02:30:55.541 --> 02:30:56.381]  Their own private
[02:30:56.852 --> 02:31:04.278]  The property is important, their incomes are important, and they should not transfer that to the government.
[02:31:04.358 --> 02:31:11.625]  Their first chance to express themselves politically is coming up in the next congressional election.
[02:31:14.007 --> 02:31:23.535]  You all and all of us have to try to mobilize the most massive turnout of people who reject this current approach.
[02:31:24.687 --> 02:31:35.069]  And begin to turn it around and get back to what would be the basic, fundamental principles of constitutional government that we were founded upon.
[02:31:35.913 --> 02:31:46.299]  Well, I noticed you mentioned the last few administrations being a problem, and so I'm glad you're recognizing, obviously, that both parties are run by these special interests.
[02:31:46.939 --> 02:31:50.821]  Why would big, wealthy interests want to collectivize things?
[02:31:50.881 --> 02:31:54.623]  Is that because it creates monopolies, allows them to shut down their competition?
[02:31:54.663 --> 02:31:58.745]  I mean, it's not just a bunch of hippies and communists running around that are doing this.
[02:31:58.785 --> 02:32:00.846]  They've got a lot of powerful friends.
[02:32:01.987 --> 02:32:03.608]  Well, there's no question there's a lot of
[02:32:05.760 --> 02:32:07.440]  Money influence in this process.
[02:32:08.841 --> 02:32:20.203]  And I don't know what's motivating people who have basically been dependent on a free enterprise system to get where they are today.
[02:32:20.684 --> 02:32:28.926]  Now clearly, small business, medium-sized business, the kind of business that I'm involved in in various ways, they do not operate that way.
[02:32:29.766 --> 02:32:34.107]  But there are, particularly in the media and entertainment world,
[02:32:35.049 --> 02:32:58.125]  Corporations who have bought into and believe that their future is going to be tied to, their economic future, tied to this approach to attacking liberty and to building a more socialistic approach to providing for the needs of the American people.
[02:33:00.274 --> 02:33:02.735]  That is a very dangerous trend, there's no question about it.
[02:33:02.755 --> 02:33:18.425]  It's made it even worse by the way we've allowed the Congress not only to become permanent fixtures, very few Congressmen and Senators, if they run for re-election, ever get defeated.
[02:33:19.826 --> 02:33:24.369]  And that's in large part because the federal election laws have been
[02:33:27.133 --> 02:33:31.214]  Well, Dr. Schmidt, Apollo astronaut, Apollo 18 astronaut, I
[02:33:56.806 --> 02:33:58.907]  I'm sure you've probably seen the Cyberbullying Act.
[02:33:59.967 --> 02:34:01.948]  I've even got local newscasts pushing it now.
[02:34:02.008 --> 02:34:03.009]  The press is that bad.
[02:34:03.369 --> 02:34:04.289]  The Hate Crimes Act.
[02:34:04.429 --> 02:34:13.653]  It now says if your speech causes someone to do something violent, even if you're not calling for violence, they're going to come arrest you.
[02:34:14.513 --> 02:34:22.236]  And now the FBI is fluttering around saying if somebody makes a comment on a message board that's yours, we may come after you for what they said.
[02:34:22.256 --> 02:34:25.778]  I mean, this is really happening to people I know.
[02:34:26.992 --> 02:34:33.295]  Well, that's why we've got to make a change of direction in the United States government, a drastic change.
[02:34:34.716 --> 02:34:40.539]  And as I say, the next election is the key turning point.
[02:34:40.799 --> 02:34:43.861]  The next two elections are particularly key.
[02:34:44.761 --> 02:34:55.847]  If the powers that are currently in Washington maintain their control through this next election, the next two elections, then I'm not sure how you turn it around.
[02:34:56.897 --> 02:35:02.958]  Okay, in the 16 minutes or so we have left with you, I want to shift gears now and get into the moon.
[02:35:03.279 --> 02:35:09.420]  Return to the Moon, it has that really great other headline here about colonizing.
[02:35:09.460 --> 02:35:11.601]  In fact, guys, put that up on screen for the TV viewers.
[02:35:11.621 --> 02:35:13.541]  I don't think you used that word.
[02:35:13.621 --> 02:35:14.821]  I think I used settling.
[02:35:15.481 --> 02:35:18.222]  Sure, that's why I wanted to put it up on the screen so I could actually... There it is.
[02:35:18.462 --> 02:35:21.023]  The Human Settlement of Space, Return to the Moon.
[02:35:21.063 --> 02:35:23.423]  Tell us what that headline means for the book.
[02:35:24.484 --> 02:35:25.464]  Well, the...
[02:35:27.489 --> 02:35:33.171]  The Moon is the nearest place in space where human beings can homestead.
[02:35:34.512 --> 02:35:52.540]  The resources are there to once settlements are established, the resources are there not only to support those settlements with the water and oxygen and food and other things that you need, independently of the Earth, but
[02:35:53.618 --> 02:36:05.064]  There is one resource that's there that allows for an economy that can, through the export of that resource, to the Earth.
[02:36:05.164 --> 02:36:12.287]  And that's a light isotope of helium called Helium-3, which is a nearly ideal fuel for fusion power generation.
[02:36:13.368 --> 02:36:15.789]  And so that's what the book is all about.
[02:36:15.829 --> 02:36:19.231]  It tries to put together, in a very, very broad way,
[02:36:20.432 --> 02:36:30.678]  The beginnings of a plan for the private sector to initiate the settlement of the Moon and to provide the Earth with a major new energy resource.
[02:36:31.879 --> 02:36:32.339]  Amazing.
[02:36:33.199 --> 02:36:44.085]  Now, just because your bio is so lengthy, in a nutshell, tell us about your career as a AAA astronaut, you know, lunar astronaut.
[02:36:44.526 --> 02:36:45.426]  Tell us about that.
[02:36:45.586 --> 02:36:48.528]  Tell us about the missions, just in a nutshell, and then I've got some questions.
[02:36:49.875 --> 02:37:00.040]  Well, my career started as a geologist, the son of a geologist actually, in southern New Mexico.
[02:37:00.481 --> 02:37:03.082]  Caltech trained and then a Harvard PhD.
[02:37:03.762 --> 02:37:06.084]  I did a lot of field work in Norway and Alaska.
[02:37:06.944 --> 02:37:17.790]  And when NASA and the National Academy of Sciences asked for volunteers for the first selection of scientist astronauts, I thought about 10 seconds and raised my hand.
[02:37:18.656 --> 02:37:21.878]  And figuring that if I didn't, I'd probably regret it.
[02:37:22.118 --> 02:37:23.298]  And I would have, obviously.
[02:37:25.519 --> 02:37:42.127]  But while at Harvard, I became increasingly concerned about the direction that Harvard-trained so-called public servants were taking us, and figured that if I was that concerned, that sometime in my life I'd better think about getting into politics.
[02:37:42.808 --> 02:37:45.309]  That opportunity came after my astronaut career.
[02:37:46.244 --> 02:37:51.469]  I had essentially been completed and I was elected to the United States Senate.
[02:37:51.489 --> 02:37:56.793]  Spent six years there learning a great deal about how sausage is made.
[02:37:57.874 --> 02:38:00.256]  More than most people would like to know, I think.
[02:38:01.777 --> 02:38:08.143]  And then in the middle of the depression of the recession of 1982, I lost my seat.
[02:38:12.595 --> 02:38:25.845]  Here in New Mexico and went into an accelerated learning experience in the private sector and free enterprise and business related activities.
[02:38:26.305 --> 02:38:30.308]  Well that's awesome and again the book is Return to the Moon available everywhere.
[02:38:31.189 --> 02:38:32.450]  Harrison Smith is our guest.
[02:38:32.890 --> 02:38:35.052]  How many moon missions were you involved in in total?
[02:38:35.472 --> 02:38:40.976]  Well I was involved in essentially all the moon missions but I only flew on Apollo 17.
[02:38:42.453 --> 02:38:43.974]  The last of the Apollo series.
[02:38:46.336 --> 02:38:51.320]  My involvement in other missions was multifaceted.
[02:38:51.460 --> 02:39:01.408]  I was primarily responsible for setting up the Lunar Science and Geological Science training program for the pilot astronauts.
[02:39:02.348 --> 02:39:09.033]  I was responsible for overseeing for the astronaut office the development of various scientific experiments.
[02:39:11.505 --> 02:39:17.530]  And you also have discovered a lot of the most important rocks.
[02:39:18.891 --> 02:39:23.875]  Which mission put that laser up that the University of Texas contacts?
[02:39:24.615 --> 02:39:28.839]  It was actually deployed on the moon three different times.
[02:39:28.859 --> 02:39:38.046]  The first one by Apollo 11, as a matter of fact, 40 years ago, was a reflector and the various
[02:39:39.675 --> 02:39:56.433]  Uh, observatories now shoot that, those reflectors, the three of them, that were finally deployed, with laser beams, and have been able to, uh, very, very precisely determine distance from the Earth to the Moon, as well as the motion to the Continent.
[02:39:57.628 --> 02:40:01.392]  Alright, we're running down on time and you've agreed to come back on in the future on science issues.
[02:40:01.412 --> 02:40:02.773]  It's just amazing having you.
[02:40:03.274 --> 02:40:13.224]  But I will be broiled and skewered and drawn and quartered and hung and then tanned if I don't bring this up because we talk about hoaxes.
[02:40:13.264 --> 02:40:18.550]  We have this giant government hoax of global warming right now, clearly trying to get control.
[02:40:20.211 --> 02:40:30.055]  Before I ask this, I want to say I have a friend, Raymond Teague, who worked on the main mission control on repeated Apollos, ran RCA cameras, and then RCA cameras on Skylab.
[02:40:30.635 --> 02:40:36.337]  And I've known Raymond for 14 years, and he says the whole thing's real, none of it's faked.
[02:40:36.897 --> 02:40:39.278]  You know, the whole nine yards, and I know he's the real deal.
[02:40:39.758 --> 02:40:48.182]  I have other people I know being here in Texas who worked on the mission, and they say, if there was any chicanery, then they were conning us too, and that's pretty darn hard to do.
[02:40:48.283 --> 02:40:54.646]  Forty years later, and I never really cover this issue, but I get calls every day, emails about it, TV shows everywhere.
[02:40:54.966 --> 02:41:05.531]  What is your take on the people more and more believing, I've seen polls as high as 30 percent, that aspects of the whole thing was faked?
[02:41:06.820 --> 02:41:13.646]  Well, I think in a serious vein that it is another reflection on the government-run school system.
[02:41:13.686 --> 02:41:15.267]  That system does not teach history.
[02:41:16.988 --> 02:41:25.075]  There are several generations now who have come through it that have had very little exposure to American history or world history in an objective way.
[02:41:26.036 --> 02:41:36.364]  And right now you have a population that has not learned the complexities that had to be
[02:41:36.994 --> 02:41:37.715]  We're good to go.
[02:41:59.458 --> 02:42:03.719]  But in a way that, I mean, that's a positive thing to not be totally trusting.
[02:42:03.739 --> 02:42:04.719]  The founders said that.
[02:42:05.139 --> 02:42:07.360]  I think a lot of it's so much government lying.
[02:42:07.980 --> 02:42:11.041]  People are so untrusting now, they don't even trust me on a lot of issues.
[02:42:11.381 --> 02:42:12.781]  I mean, people don't trust their neighbors.
[02:42:13.622 --> 02:42:16.342]  And society does seem to be degenerating a bit.
[02:42:17.162 --> 02:42:21.944]  My only issue is, that said, that I know people that worked on the mission who say it was absolutely real.
[02:42:22.304 --> 02:42:24.784]  And you can watch famous films of them in mission control.
[02:42:24.804 --> 02:42:26.645]  People I know, they're not making it up.
[02:42:29.207 --> 02:42:34.809]  For a conspiracy like that to work, you would have to have conned 450,000 Americans.
[02:42:34.849 --> 02:42:38.270]  Because that's how many worked on the program.
[02:42:38.290 --> 02:42:40.511]  That's how many worked, and you just couldn't do it.
[02:42:40.571 --> 02:42:51.456]  Look, people have to remember that there's still, when you have a population of the world as large as we have, a very, very micro percentage is still a significant number.
[02:42:51.956 --> 02:42:54.817]  And some of those people actually still believe the Earth is black.
[02:42:55.796 --> 02:42:59.208]  So if a few of them want to believe that we didn't go to the moon, let them.
[02:42:59.950 --> 02:43:02.499]  It's not an issue that comes up in my presentation.
[02:43:03.871 --> 02:43:07.353]  Well, I mean, the earth being flat, that's clearly ridiculous.
[02:43:07.633 --> 02:43:13.955]  Though I've actually been contacted by some flat earthers saying I'm covering up the fact that it's some Atlantean conspiracy.
[02:43:13.995 --> 02:43:17.897]  But the reason, I mean, obviously you know this has been building.
[02:43:18.297 --> 02:43:24.339]  I would imagine you get asked that sometimes because there are issues that make people question.
[02:43:24.739 --> 02:43:26.480]  And so let me just throw a few of those out to you.
[02:43:28.081 --> 02:43:28.981]  Wait a minute.
[02:43:30.001 --> 02:43:35.423]  I think there are more important things to talk about, but just let me say that when I'm out talking to the public, I do not get that question.
[02:43:35.463 --> 02:43:40.705]  I only get that question from talk show hosts.
[02:43:40.745 --> 02:43:41.685]  Really, that's true.
[02:43:42.326 --> 02:43:44.947]  And so I think we ought to spend our time on more important issues.
[02:43:45.387 --> 02:43:48.808]  Okay, why haven't we been back to the moon in 40 years?
[02:43:51.906 --> 02:44:12.891]  Well, that's a really long topic, but the most immediate is that even though George W. Bush articulated a very good return to the moon and on beyond policy, neither his budget office or the Congress properly funded that.
[02:44:13.351 --> 02:44:18.052]  Had it been properly funded, we would be well on our way as we speak.
[02:44:18.692 --> 02:44:20.673]  But in the absence of adequate funding,
[02:44:21.740 --> 02:44:25.481]  We have had to flip schedules in order to keep the program alive.
[02:44:26.042 --> 02:44:38.466]  Now you have an administration that, for all indications, is not going to pursue an aggressive role for the United States in deep space.
[02:44:38.726 --> 02:44:44.388]  And they're going to leave that to the Chinese, potentially the Indians and the Japanese, and maybe Europe.
[02:44:45.494 --> 02:44:48.015]  And that, I think, is an extraordinary mistake.
[02:44:48.095 --> 02:44:54.357]  It's as big a mistake in the long term as we could make relative to protecting liberty here on this planet.
[02:44:54.957 --> 02:44:55.217]  Sure.
[02:44:55.237 --> 02:45:06.521]  If you have non-democratic regimes dominant in deep space, dominant on the moon and elsewhere, then it's going to be very, very difficult to continue to protect liberty on this planet.
[02:45:07.017 --> 02:45:07.217]  Sure.
[02:45:07.497 --> 02:45:34.637]  Have you heard of, I guess you were in the Senate around that time, Dr. Bob Bowman, who worked on some of the Star Wars program before it was declassified in the early 80s, and he's saying, and he's told me, he said, look Alex, not only is there a space program, but there's a lot of it you don't know about and I can't tell you about it, but he's mentioned a few things that have slipped out or been declassified, you know, the whole robotic program, and they admit that a lot of the shuttles have been military secret missions.
[02:45:37.123 --> 02:45:37.684]  Not a lot.
[02:45:37.724 --> 02:45:50.394]  There have been a few Air Force missions, or missions of the Space Shuttle, in which there were some classified payloads, but you shouldn't have a lot.
[02:45:50.674 --> 02:45:55.558]  All the Shuttle flights, with very few exceptions, have been purely civilian flights.
[02:45:56.099 --> 02:45:56.319]  Sure.
[02:45:56.419 --> 02:45:59.662]  You did a lot of the photography on the Moon, didn't you?
[02:46:00.402 --> 02:46:03.184]  Oh yeah, well both Gene Cernan and I had cameras,
[02:46:04.466 --> 02:46:06.127]  Uh, we took a lot of the pictures.
[02:46:06.247 --> 02:46:11.911]  I happened to, uh, be more active in taking pictures of the Earth as we went towards the moon.
[02:46:11.971 --> 02:46:15.734]  And so that, uh, polar... But you took the famous blue marble photo, didn't you?
[02:46:15.894 --> 02:46:19.117]  The polar Earth that shows the continent of Africa in its entirety.
[02:46:19.137 --> 02:46:20.077]  Yeah, that's one I took.
[02:46:20.518 --> 02:46:23.500]  I was about 34,000 miles away from Earth when I snapped that.
[02:46:24.560 --> 02:46:25.161]  Now, again,
[02:46:27.458 --> 02:46:30.119]  Because people kill me that don't ask, where are the stars?
[02:46:30.179 --> 02:46:34.020]  Is it because the Earth is so bright that it blots those out?
[02:46:34.420 --> 02:46:39.182]  Yes, it's the same problem you have on a sunny day here on Earth of seeing stars.
[02:46:39.762 --> 02:46:46.964]  There's just too much light for a wonderful optical system we call our eyes to handle.
[02:46:47.264 --> 02:46:54.106]  The eyes are great, but they do not have what scientists call a dynamic range to see both the bright surfaces and stars.
[02:46:54.875 --> 02:47:00.679]  Well, that's like when the moon is up at night, you can't see stars anywhere around it, right?
[02:47:00.959 --> 02:47:01.499]  That's correct.
[02:47:01.560 --> 02:47:02.040]  Same thing.
[02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:11.006]  The moon just dominates the eye and the eye doesn't close down enough, doesn't close the iris enough to see the stars.
[02:47:13.373 --> 02:47:42.675]  Well, I know we've got advanced technologies, and I know the A-bomb and the hydrogen bomb and the superconducting super colliders are real, and I know that there are some space plane programs, even if you say there aren't, Dr. Schmidt, that are going on, and so that's why I believe in our potential, and I want to believe we went to the moon, and I believe you, you know, when you sit here, I mean, you sound very credible to me, I just, you say you don't get asked this on the street, people are probably scared to ask you, I mean, I'm sure you've seen all
[02:47:43.255 --> 02:47:44.135]  No, no, no.
[02:47:44.175 --> 02:47:47.577]  The American people are never scared to ask anybody a question.
[02:47:48.037 --> 02:47:48.497]  Believe me.
[02:47:49.818 --> 02:47:50.358]  I understand.
[02:47:50.378 --> 02:47:51.058]  You have to deal with it.
[02:47:51.078 --> 02:47:51.518]  Fortunately, I don't.
[02:47:59.502 --> 02:48:08.948]  Well, I mean, I know you're right about the global warming being a hoax, and I mean, there's government and corporations engaged in a hoax, so I think that's... I mean, how do we fix this crisis of confidence?
[02:48:09.008 --> 02:48:13.431]  Because it's even happening not just with the government, as you know, it's happening with people in business now.
[02:48:14.292 --> 02:48:15.072]  How do we fix that?
[02:48:16.914 --> 02:48:24.639]  Well, I think you fix it by, again, people of common sense taking back control of their government and making them right.
[02:48:25.379 --> 02:48:27.861]  And getting good people to run for office.
[02:48:28.961 --> 02:48:32.843]  I personally would like to see term limits, but you're never going to get the Congress to do it.
[02:48:32.883 --> 02:48:37.225]  That's something the states are going to have to do if we're ever going to have a constitutional amendment.
[02:48:38.065 --> 02:48:47.189]  The founders just didn't realize that their successors would make a career out of going into politics.
[02:48:48.129 --> 02:48:50.990]  It was not on their visible horizon.
[02:48:51.211 --> 02:48:52.751]  Sure, we only have about two and a half minutes left.
[02:48:52.791 --> 02:48:56.513]  Dr. Schmidt, one word to describe what it's like to be
[02:48:58.250 --> 02:49:02.091]  400,000 miles away, or less, from the Earth.
[02:49:02.611 --> 02:49:05.052]  One word to describe standing on another planet.
[02:49:05.732 --> 02:49:06.152]  Privilege.
[02:49:07.253 --> 02:49:11.634]  I was greatly honored and privileged to have an opportunity to do it, as were all of my colleagues.
[02:49:11.754 --> 02:49:15.675]  We were just the tip of the spear.
[02:49:16.495 --> 02:49:21.597]  450,000 Americans held that spear, and we just represented them on the moon, but they made it happen.
[02:49:23.291 --> 02:49:28.834]  And that is my last question on the issue and then I won't ever bring it up to you again, I promise, if you join us again.
[02:49:29.695 --> 02:49:33.837]  How did the film make it back through the Van Allen radiation belt?
[02:49:34.897 --> 02:49:38.639]  Well, that belt doesn't have that much radiation.
[02:49:38.659 --> 02:49:41.101]  If it was going to damage the film, it would have damaged us.
[02:49:45.318 --> 02:49:51.890]  There is radiation there, and if you lingered in it over time, you could accumulate a dose that could be a problem.
[02:49:51.930 --> 02:49:56.979]  But we went through it so fast that there wasn't any significant dose on the film or on...
[02:49:58.356 --> 02:49:59.117]  Well, you know what's neat?
[02:49:59.137 --> 02:50:00.678]  We're starting to see space tourism.
[02:50:00.698 --> 02:50:05.501]  If they'd really give us a space program, some of us could live long enough to actually go to the moon.
[02:50:05.822 --> 02:50:09.224]  But pretty soon they'll say the moon doesn't exist, and maybe it's made out of cheese.
[02:50:09.845 --> 02:50:14.008]  Let me tell you, Mr. Schmidt, Dr. Schmidt, Return to the Moon is the book.
[02:50:14.068 --> 02:50:18.591]  He's out there exposing global warming as the fraud it is, man-made global warming.
[02:50:19.111 --> 02:50:22.314]  Is there any websites to fire out, sir, or any other info?
[02:50:23.715 --> 02:50:27.338]  No, I think if people look at the book Return to the Moon, they'll
[02:50:28.624 --> 02:50:37.350]  Yeah, I'd like to have you back up in the next few months to just talk about the book itself and more about the moon.
[02:50:37.450 --> 02:50:40.572]  And thank you for entertaining those questions.
[02:50:41.153 --> 02:50:42.313]  Let me say bye to you here at the end.
[02:50:42.574 --> 02:50:44.795]  Retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com.
[02:50:45.856 --> 02:50:47.897]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:50:48.478 --> 02:50:51.620]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:50:53.968 --> 02:50:57.930]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:50:58.190 --> 02:50:59.972]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:51:00.192 --> 02:51:08.477]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:51:08.717 --> 02:51:13.940]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:51:14.260 --> 02:51:15.881]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:51:16.121 --> 02:51:22.449]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:51:22.649 --> 02:51:33.402]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[02:51:33.702 --> 02:51:34.163]  That's right.
[02:51:34.443 --> 02:51:35.745]  Coast to coast and in your face!
