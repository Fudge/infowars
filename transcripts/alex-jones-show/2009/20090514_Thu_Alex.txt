[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.409]  Congruent.
[00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:01.649]  You ready?
[00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:03.990]  We're going live right now?
[00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:05.450]  We live now?
[00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.411]  Alright, we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv, just started simulcasting with the syndicated radio show.
[00:00:12.572 --> 00:00:23.394]  And I was just making the point before we go to Jim Tucker from Greece, outside Athens, Bilderberg 2009, that Obama is now saying that we're going to go ahead and have indefinite detention.
[00:00:23.874 --> 00:00:24.314]  Indefinite.
[00:00:25.472 --> 00:00:30.355]  See, they sell the public on tyranny for foreigners and no rights when it's really for the American people.
[00:00:31.036 --> 00:00:32.017]  Now they've introduced the bills.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.002]  To arrest you if you criticize somebody and they say it hurts their feelings in the Cyber Bullying Act.
[00:00:37.022 --> 00:00:44.367]  They have this other act with a no-fly list for gun owners where you can't own a gun if the government secretly puts you on like a no-fly list type system.
[00:00:44.847 --> 00:00:46.288]  I keep telling folks that's what that was for.
[00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:47.169]  Well, we'll go over it.
[00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:50.271]  But joining us now, we're about to go to break, is Jim Tucker.
[00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:54.953]  And Jim Tucker, it's good to have you here with us joining us from Greece.
[00:00:54.993 --> 00:01:00.357]  Tell us exactly where Bilderberg is meeting this year and where you are located right now.
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:13.285]  Well, they're meeting at the, uh, Aspire Palace Hotel, not Aspica, Aspire Palace Resort, really, uh, as they did in 1993.
[00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:18.388]  Uh, security's been stepped up heavily again this year.
[00:01:18.408 --> 00:01:19.929]  Of course, it's always heavy security.
[00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:23.730]  But this year, Bilderberg, uh, spent so much money.
[00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.112]  One of these places, there's a compound of three
[00:01:28.147 --> 00:01:30.028]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:57.426]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:01:57.546 --> 00:02:02.167]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:02:02.287 --> 00:02:05.048]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:02:05.248 --> 00:02:08.109]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.011]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:14.172]  If you simply prepare.
[00:02:14.372 --> 00:02:17.354]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:02:17.615 --> 00:02:24.520]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:00.460]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.801]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:03:10.344 --> 00:03:11.005]  Big Brother.
[00:03:11.645 --> 00:03:12.706]  Mainstream media.
[00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:14.526]  Government cover-ups.
[00:03:15.187 --> 00:03:15.987]  You want answers?
[00:03:16.747 --> 00:03:17.668]  Well, so does he.
[00:03:17.688 --> 00:03:21.970]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.552]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:03:29.746 --> 00:03:37.170]  Same time tomorrow, Jim Tucker of American Free Press, covering Bilderberg for 30 plus years, will be joining us.
[00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.971]  They narrowed it down to several hotels.
[00:03:39.991 --> 00:03:42.332]  There's army and police guarding several of them.
[00:03:42.452 --> 00:03:45.334]  A reporter got arrested.
[00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:50.596]  Well, you talk about the Guardian reporter who interviewed me yesterday, this morning.
[00:03:50.616 --> 00:03:52.237]  He was one of a large number of reporters who
[00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:23.071]  With cameras, TV-type guys mostly, who were on public land taking photographs.
[00:04:23.091 --> 00:04:27.314]  The cops came up, surrounded them, took their film away.
[00:04:28.775 --> 00:04:32.217]  Many of them were held for several minutes with drawn guns pointed at them.
[00:04:32.857 --> 00:04:34.958]  Some of them all being buried free press.
[00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:37.900]  Not this next issue you get, but the one after that one.
[00:04:38.553 --> 00:04:42.695]  So it's been very brutal security, very heavy security.
[00:04:43.135 --> 00:04:48.658]  Yet, there's a lot of reporters here who are pursuing them, and we're getting a lot of good information.
[00:04:49.158 --> 00:04:58.522]  For example, we now know that Bill O'Reilly is telling his little pet weevil, Obama, to go after U.S.
[00:04:58.843 --> 00:05:01.824]  acceptance of the International Criminal Court Treaty.
[00:05:02.384 --> 00:05:03.325]  You know the history of that.
[00:05:04.854 --> 00:05:14.178]  Uh, Bill and Mary Clinton signed off on it, but would not submit it to Congress for ratification when a tenth vote showed it failed by more than 90 votes.
[00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:21.982]  So Obama's being told to sweet-talk so many of the senators who wanted to sign off, but they were scared by the voters who objected so strongly.
[00:05:22.002 --> 00:05:29.945]  Uh, and then hoped for a more left-wing Senate elected in 2010, so that in January of 2011,
[00:05:33.137 --> 00:05:44.482]  They can pass the thing late on a Saturday evening, too late for the Sunday morning papers, too late for the morning talk shows, and assure them that America could be unaware of it.
[00:05:44.502 --> 00:05:45.542]  It will not be reported.
[00:05:46.402 --> 00:05:50.104]  You can vote for it without risking your political neck.
[00:05:51.244 --> 00:05:53.725]  Of course, we deal about other parts of the agenda in advance.
[00:05:53.765 --> 00:05:59.467]  That's the only new thing I've got right now, but we're getting a lot of good information daily.
[00:05:59.507 --> 00:06:00.548]  I'll have a lot more tomorrow.
[00:06:01.215 --> 00:06:02.976]  And a lot more before I come home on Sunday.
[00:06:03.536 --> 00:06:09.020]  And we have some people here until Monday to do some follow-up.
[00:06:11.261 --> 00:06:18.305]  And the amount of money they spent on security this year to rent a huge resort to keep it empty.
[00:06:18.325 --> 00:06:22.748]  And then the other resorts themselves, the third resort is being renovated.
[00:06:23.248 --> 00:06:25.670]  Can you imagine the big bucks they spend to say,
[00:06:26.807 --> 00:06:30.329]  Uh, we'll tell you not to fill up that resort.
[00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:31.349]  Keep it empty.
[00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:39.073]  Okay, Jim, Jim, to be clear, to be clear, uh, what are the names of the resorts and, and, and, and which one are you honing in on?
[00:06:39.133 --> 00:06:41.394]  Which one do you believe is probably the place?
[00:06:41.414 --> 00:06:51.659]  Well, I know for a fact that there's, uh, there's, uh, Nausicaa, uh, I don't know why I always have the trouble pronouncing it, uh, Nausicaa Astaire, uh, hotel.
[00:06:52.359 --> 00:06:54.000]  I know for a fact that they're there.
[00:06:55.596 --> 00:06:58.578]  Good Lord, you've never seen so many cops.
[00:06:58.638 --> 00:06:59.718]  You always see a lot of cops.
[00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:07.162]  But, uh, for blocks away, uh, my hotel is about two and a half miles away.
[00:07:07.182 --> 00:07:10.984]  Okay, so you're saying they hired other giant resort decoys, then.
[00:07:11.004 --> 00:07:12.965]  Are you saying... Not a decoy.
[00:07:12.985 --> 00:07:14.026]  Go ahead.
[00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:16.247]  It's not a decoy.
[00:07:16.267 --> 00:07:19.649]  They hired it so that they could close the main gate leading to the whole palace.
[00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:21.850]  All the palace grounds.
[00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.711]  So, they're still off at the, uh,
[00:07:24.478 --> 00:07:26.761]  We're good to go.
[00:07:46.227 --> 00:07:49.248]  Alright, Jim, we're going to do a few more minutes on the other side.
[00:07:49.288 --> 00:07:53.650]  I want to specifically ask you, it sounds like you're saying this, but we'll get the answer in a couple of minutes.
[00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.431]  Is this the most security you've ever seen for Bilderberg?
[00:07:56.551 --> 00:07:57.852]  And is Tim Geithner there?
[00:07:58.552 --> 00:08:02.574]  And Perotz, Times of London, they're all admitting it's world government.
[00:08:02.894 --> 00:08:04.955]  They have validated everything we've ever said.
[00:08:04.995 --> 00:08:05.475]  Stay with us.
[00:08:05.615 --> 00:08:14.283]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[00:08:14.343 --> 00:08:19.928]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[00:08:20.348 --> 00:08:21.990]  Deficiency in any one
[00:08:22.483 --> 00:08:22.703]  Of course!
[00:08:40.109 --> 00:08:41.489]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:09:09.927 --> 00:09:12.048]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:09:12.768 --> 00:09:18.110]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:24.832]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:09:25.152 --> 00:09:26.953]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:09:27.113 --> 00:09:29.494]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:09:29.574 --> 00:09:39.317]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[00:09:39.778 --> 00:09:40.478]  That's fascist.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.000]  It's not about left or right.
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.821]  It's about a one world government.
[00:09:46.281 --> 00:09:52.645]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:10:01.449 --> 00:10:02.610]  The Obama Deception.
[00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.211]  The people strike back.
[00:10:06.474 --> 00:10:11.938]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:10:11.978 --> 00:10:12.498]  and the world.
[00:10:12.758 --> 00:10:16.220]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:22.864]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:10:23.125 --> 00:10:24.906]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:33.111]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:10:33.371 --> 00:10:37.798]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:10:38.079 --> 00:10:43.627]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:10:43.908 --> 00:10:45.911]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:10:46.071 --> 00:10:48.335]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you
[00:10:48.655 --> 00:10:49.436]  Free of charge.

[00:11:02.408 --> 00:11:11.016]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:11:11.397 --> 00:11:13.659]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.260]  Alright, we've got about three minutes left with Jim Tucker.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.841]  He's got to go back into a press conference.
[00:11:24.861 --> 00:11:26.101]  We pulled him away from that.
[00:11:26.141 --> 00:11:27.181]  He's surrounded by media.
[00:11:28.241 --> 00:11:33.942]  Jim, are you saying this is the most, in 30 plus years covering this, the most security you've ever seen?
[00:11:33.962 --> 00:11:35.243]  Yes.
[00:11:35.643 --> 00:11:39.843]  Okay, and... It goes for blocks and blocks up and down the road.
[00:11:40.744 --> 00:11:48.565]  And then we have a London Guardian reporter just walking on the beach sidewalk, he says, and that they run over with machine guns and throw him in a police car.
[00:11:49.813 --> 00:11:58.479]  Yes, they did, and as I said before, that's happened to a large number of media types out there yesterday and today.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.761]  Oh, so it's naming business?
[00:12:03.563 --> 00:12:11.648]  Many of the European media guys have been grabbed and held, guns pointed at them and screamed at them.
[00:12:11.988 --> 00:12:17.032]  Their films ripped out, forced to erase their film and stuff like that.
[00:12:18.823 --> 00:12:21.545]  There'll be a lot in the paper on that very subject.
[00:12:22.246 --> 00:12:25.908]  AmericanFreePress.net, when are we going to see some of your first reports on this?
[00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:31.773]  Well, the paper that was being mailed today, Thursday, will have the report I filed.
[00:12:34.315 --> 00:12:35.476]  Well, this morning your time.
[00:12:38.478 --> 00:12:45.283]  It'll have about a 500 word story on what little we've learned in advance of the meeting and some photographs.
[00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:52.060]  And then the full report will be in the paper that goes to press a week from today.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.940]  I'll put it up back in Washington.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.080]  Good.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.021]  And we're going to have you on next week as soon as you get back.
[00:12:56.061 --> 00:12:56.821]  You're always gracious.
[00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:58.902]  And tomorrow at 12 noon, our time.
[00:12:59.462 --> 00:13:00.422]  What time is it in Greece?
[00:13:00.462 --> 00:13:00.943]  Eight o'clock?
[00:13:02.043 --> 00:13:02.743]  Eight o'clock, yeah.
[00:13:03.123 --> 00:13:06.124]  Okay, now two final questions, Jim, and this is key.
[00:13:06.564 --> 00:13:07.765]  So you've identified the hotel.
[00:13:07.805 --> 00:13:10.145]  They've shut down a whole complex, though, blocks and blocks.
[00:13:10.926 --> 00:13:11.866]  We're getting reports
[00:13:12.506 --> 00:13:26.057]  That Tim Geithner is going to be in attendance, and even the Times of London and others are saying that his schedule is suspiciously empty, and that this is the final meeting setting up the new banking infrastructure.
[00:13:27.138 --> 00:13:29.060]  Yeah, well, Geithner was there last year.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:41.370]  Secretaries of defense, state, and treasury always attend, as you know, as do high officials of the White House and other government figures.
[00:13:42.054 --> 00:13:58.201]  So he's definitely here, and Carl Bildt is going to make a speech about how to exploit the economic downturn to boost the long lead of the U.N.'
[00:13:58.141 --> 00:14:00.101]  's World Department of Treasury.
[00:14:01.442 --> 00:14:07.904]  Now, that's illegal, isn't it, to have sitting government officials at a private meeting in secret discussing and setting policy?
[00:14:08.125 --> 00:14:09.345]  That's a violation of the Logan Act.
[00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:19.793]  And a lot of cute little liberals say, well, the Logan Act was passed in 1787, or 1889, something like that.
[00:14:20.393 --> 00:14:22.074]  Well, sure, it's still there.
[00:14:22.154 --> 00:14:23.895]  It's been amended many times over the years.
[00:14:23.915 --> 00:14:32.718]  That shows that Congress still favors the Logan Act, with the amendment to tighten it up.
[00:14:33.379 --> 00:14:35.259]  But it's not been amended.
[00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:36.580]  It's still the law until it's repealed.
[00:14:37.051 --> 00:14:42.175]  All right, one last question because London Guardian reporter Charlie Skelton was supposed to be on the show.
[00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:44.137]  He's now in a police station.
[00:14:44.157 --> 00:14:45.058]  This is breaking news.
[00:14:45.078 --> 00:14:52.484]  I know you're going to hear this, Jim Tucker, but I've got to get this final question in unless your phone line gets lost or something.
[00:14:53.144 --> 00:14:58.065]  Any other key information from your Bilderberg sources about what is on the agenda?
[00:14:58.085 --> 00:15:04.147]  We know they're pressuring Obama to pass this gun ban treaty, and Obama's given speeches saying he does want to do that.
[00:15:04.387 --> 00:15:05.367]  Is that on the agenda?
[00:15:05.407 --> 00:15:10.769]  The global currency tax, the greenhouse taxes, the carbon taxes?
[00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:11.809]  I mean, what's on the agenda?
[00:15:13.049 --> 00:15:19.211]  All of that's on the agenda under the program that we do, the United World Action.
[00:15:20.055 --> 00:15:24.199]  Global action on a global basis by a global government.
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.742]  That's all of it, and it's being pushed very hard.
[00:15:27.461 --> 00:15:30.663]  And this must be an important meeting if it's the greatest security you've ever seen.
[00:15:31.284 --> 00:15:33.625]  Jim Tucker, stay there one moment.
[00:15:33.645 --> 00:15:42.311]  I know you've got to go to that press conference, but Charlie Skelton, who was already picked up by police, and that's the London Guardian, and I thought got out of it, is back in the police station.
[00:15:42.671 --> 00:15:44.272]  Is he there reporting or has he been arrested?
[00:15:44.292 --> 00:15:46.214]  I know you want to hear this, Jim, so stay there for a moment.
[00:15:47.995 --> 00:15:51.017]  Charlie Skelton, the London Guardian, have you been arrested again?
[00:15:52.612 --> 00:15:53.593]  Well, I wouldn't say arrested.
[00:15:53.673 --> 00:15:54.133]  Detained.
[00:15:54.493 --> 00:15:54.793]  Again.
[00:15:56.134 --> 00:15:57.595]  Yes, I seem to be making a habit of this.
[00:15:57.635 --> 00:16:00.037]  That's twice now in two days.
[00:16:02.078 --> 00:16:06.080]  Jim Tucker's on the line with us and can get this out to the press conference he's about to go back to.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.661]  Jim, do you have any questions for one another?
[00:16:07.681 --> 00:16:09.062]  I'll tell the guys we'll get downstairs.
[00:16:10.483 --> 00:16:12.224]  You're going to survive, Charlie.
[00:16:14.545 --> 00:16:15.146]  I can't quite hear.
[00:16:15.526 --> 00:16:17.767]  It was Jim Tucker who got me out of jail.
[00:16:17.927 --> 00:16:21.950]  Okay, tell us what's happening right now, Mr. Skelton.
[00:16:23.708 --> 00:16:26.310]  I'm being intervented into the logbook again.
[00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.372]  Let me just say bye to Jim then.
[00:16:28.633 --> 00:16:30.815]  Jim, we'll talk to you tomorrow at noon, okay?
[00:16:31.633 --> 00:16:32.073]  Very good.
[00:16:32.193 --> 00:16:32.914]  Good luck, Charlie.
[00:16:33.334 --> 00:16:34.775]  Talk to you at 8 o'clock your time.
[00:16:34.815 --> 00:16:35.396]  Sorry about that.
[00:16:35.436 --> 00:16:36.056]  Jim had to go.
[00:16:36.456 --> 00:16:37.657]  OK, I'm going to shut up.
[00:16:37.697 --> 00:16:45.562]  London Guardian reporter there and under international law, let me just tell you, Mr. Skelton, in case you don't know, when they turn their lights on, you're detained.
[00:16:45.923 --> 00:16:49.245]  When they put handcuffs on you or make you go somewhere, you're under arrest.
[00:16:49.645 --> 00:16:55.169]  So they don't ever want to tell you that, though, because when it turns out it was wrongfully done, it would be false arrest.
[00:16:55.569 --> 00:17:01.472]  So they play a mind game, a Jedi mind trick, of telling you, we may have forcibly taken you here, but you're not under arrest.
[00:17:01.532 --> 00:17:02.553]  You are under arrest.
[00:17:02.593 --> 00:17:04.154]  Now, you've been falsely arrested.
[00:17:04.174 --> 00:17:04.894]  Tell us what happened.
[00:17:06.395 --> 00:17:14.699]  Well, um, it's sort of embarrassing, because I've been with the same police here again today, who were telling me, you know, I can't believe we're seeing you back here.
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:21.703]  And I was saying, look, I was just trying to photograph the delegates as they arrived at Bilderberg, which I was doing.
[00:17:21.723 --> 00:17:23.364]  I was trying to get a couple of nice arty shots.
[00:17:23.857 --> 00:17:25.800]  You know, to illustrate my piece.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.703]  I'm doing a series of pieces for the Guardian website.
[00:17:28.064 --> 00:17:29.566]  I'm not, you know, I'm not a paparazzi.
[00:17:29.586 --> 00:17:30.748]  I don't have a long lens photo.
[00:17:30.808 --> 00:17:33.713]  They're detaining me because I'm standing at the side of the road with a...
[00:17:34.204 --> 00:17:35.925]  You know, a little 50-pound digital camera.
[00:17:36.325 --> 00:17:42.890]  Yeah, world leaders, 150, it's now 150 world leaders meeting publicly to set world policy.
[00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:43.930]  They now brag about it.
[00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:44.951]  We've gotten their documents.
[00:17:45.471 --> 00:17:48.193]  And you're evil with one of the biggest newspapers in the world.
[00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:48.413]  What?
[00:17:48.473 --> 00:17:49.494]  Top ten newspapers?
[00:17:49.514 --> 00:17:50.114]  London Guardian?
[00:17:50.334 --> 00:17:51.015]  In the world.
[00:17:51.355 --> 00:17:55.057]  You're there and this is the freedom of the EU.
[00:17:55.117 --> 00:17:55.778]  Please continue.
[00:17:57.406 --> 00:17:58.467]  Well, it's a little bit.
[00:17:58.507 --> 00:17:59.547]  I keep telling them.
[00:17:59.607 --> 00:18:03.129]  In fact, one of the policemen has been quite sympathetic and he said, look, I appreciate that.
[00:18:03.169 --> 00:18:03.989]  I'm just doing my job.
[00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.970]  We're in a difficult situation here.
[00:18:06.331 --> 00:18:09.612]  And, you know, he said, I said, I hope there's a protest tomorrow.
[00:18:09.632 --> 00:18:13.374]  And he said, you know, it'd be good if there was a different voice being heard.
[00:18:13.394 --> 00:18:26.561]  This is one of the policemen here because, you know, I do appreciate that I'm just being held by local, basically local policemen, you know, who have been put in a very difficult situation, I think, by the sudden dissent of all these people.
[00:18:27.177 --> 00:18:32.218]  Uh, on this tiny, you know, relatively small little Riviera town, uh, just outside Athens.
[00:18:32.498 --> 00:18:42.800]  And, um, so I feel a little bit sorry for them, but I don't feel sorry for the fact that they keep telling me just nonsense about how I can't take photographs of things, and then they keep withdrawing what they're saying, and they don't really have anything to say to me.
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.460]  They're just going through the motions.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:51.961]  And, uh, you know, the very idea that... I'm standing at the side of the road... Sorry, I'm just gonna step to one side, sorry.
[00:18:52.641 --> 00:18:53.261]  I'm not going anywhere.
[00:18:53.642 --> 00:18:55.162]  I'm just telling the policemen I'm not leaving.
[00:18:56.813 --> 00:18:58.094]  I don't know.
[00:19:17.085 --> 00:19:18.405]  I don't think they know what they're doing.
[00:19:19.206 --> 00:19:20.646]  Genuinely, I don't think they know what they're doing.
[00:19:20.666 --> 00:19:22.267]  I don't think they know what's happening here.
[00:19:44.113 --> 00:19:45.855]  I don't think anyone does.
[00:19:46.175 --> 00:19:49.558]  I don't think the people in the street know what's going on.
[00:19:49.578 --> 00:19:51.439]  I don't think they know what's going on.
[00:19:51.459 --> 00:19:55.182]  All they know is that they've got someone... Charlie Skelton running for the reporter.
[00:19:55.643 --> 00:19:55.983]  No, no, no.
[00:19:56.003 --> 00:19:59.646]  I just want to make clear here to you because I've been in the position you're in for 16 hours before.
[00:20:00.763 --> 00:20:03.387]  Sir, obviously they're compartmentalized.
[00:20:03.407 --> 00:20:15.101]  They've been told arrest, harass, track, trace, tail anybody that gets anywhere around the world leader setting for the global government conference where they adjust their world government program every year.
[00:20:16.603 --> 00:20:19.184]  Did you know Jim Tucker's been shot at in Portugal?
[00:20:19.584 --> 00:20:21.144]  Did you know I've been death-threatened?
[00:20:21.344 --> 00:20:24.725]  Did you know my wife's been called up and threatened when I'm at Bilderberg by them?
[00:20:25.125 --> 00:20:35.068]  Did you know that I've been detained for 16 hours and they told me in Canada that if they found a pin-up girl, a Betty Page, that that would be illegal transfer of pornography?
[00:20:35.328 --> 00:20:42.829]  They searched all three of our laptops and thank God none of my staff or I had even accidentally visited a topless, you know, site or something.
[00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:43.830]  I don't know what you've done.
[00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.010]  Well, I hope they don't check my laptop.
[00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.411]  No, but don't give them the idea!
[00:20:46.491 --> 00:20:47.311]  Don't give them the idea!
[00:20:47.551 --> 00:20:52.214]  My point is, is that these are terrorists, and they were told to do that by Bilderberg.
[00:20:52.254 --> 00:21:00.159]  They told me they took me off the plane when I got there and took me into customs for 16 hours because, or 15 hours, because Bilderberg had called them.
[00:21:00.179 --> 00:21:09.585]  So I'm telling you, this is a big news story, that you're a journalist, I'm a journalist, we're trying to cover this, and you're now in a police station.
[00:21:10.105 --> 00:21:11.246]  So, so, and, and, and...
[00:21:12.066 --> 00:21:22.209]  They're trying to remove me from just being an interested concerned citizen, which is basically what I'm being.
[00:21:22.529 --> 00:21:29.091]  I'm an interested concerned citizen, and I'm taking a couple of photographs on a little camera, and they're removing me from the scene.
[00:21:29.131 --> 00:21:40.835]  And it is just, obviously, this blanket policy of getting everyone away from it, keeping the lid on it, and all these massive limousines come in with the tinted windows.
[00:21:42.242 --> 00:21:42.844]  It's crazy.
[00:21:42.904 --> 00:21:45.069]  It's one of the most surreal experiences of my life.
[00:21:45.089 --> 00:21:46.914]  This is the first Bilderberg I've ever been to.
[00:21:48.563 --> 00:21:49.583]  It's genuinely surreal.
[00:21:50.063 --> 00:21:54.504]  Well, Charlie Skelton, we're going to skip this break in case they come over and turn your phone off.
[00:21:54.824 --> 00:21:56.225]  We're skipping a network break.
[00:21:56.265 --> 00:21:58.585]  Stations, this is not your break anyway, so it won't matter.
[00:21:58.845 --> 00:22:03.766]  We will take the bottom of the hour local break for everybody, but we are skipping this break.
[00:22:03.786 --> 00:22:05.406]  We're live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:05.646 --> 00:22:08.827]  Forgive me if I get excited, sir, but, you know, I'm one of these hot-blooded Texans.
[00:22:09.347 --> 00:22:10.687]  You're there for the second time.
[00:22:10.767 --> 00:22:13.688]  Tell us how this arrest happened today.
[00:22:15.419 --> 00:22:19.402]  The one today, I was, you know, it's getting towards the end of the afternoon here.
[00:22:20.123 --> 00:22:23.165]  I walked up the hill towards the hotel entrance.
[00:22:23.205 --> 00:22:25.888]  I was actually staying away from the hotel entrance because I didn't want to be arrested.
[00:22:26.388 --> 00:22:29.050]  You know, I thought, you know, I'm going to play it nice and safe today.
[00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:30.431]  I don't want to end up in the police station.
[00:22:30.751 --> 00:22:43.001]  So I was just sitting by the side of the road, a full view of some policemen, by the way, just taking some low shots of the Mercedes wheels going by in case I happened to get something looking pretty that I could put on the website to accompany the stories that I'm writing.
[00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:45.770]  I don't think so.
[00:23:01.516 --> 00:23:08.837]  You know, and suddenly I'm surrounded and, uh, you know, and the pressure comes on and, you know, it's everyone swaggering their shoulders at me.
[00:23:09.197 --> 00:23:16.279]  And it wasn't as bad as yesterday when, you know, they were, they were shouting at me and they were prodding me in the shoulder and, you know, and I really, it was quite, it got quite nasty.
[00:23:16.339 --> 00:23:18.779]  And pointing machine guns at you, you said?
[00:23:20.199 --> 00:23:21.520]  No, they weren't pointing machine guns at me.
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.640]  They had some machine guns there.
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:28.401]  I mean, you know, when you're being, you know, when you're being detained and you see someone with a, walking towards you with a machine gun, you kind of notice the gun.
[00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:35.904]  And uh, it's not nice, and you know, uh, look, there go the policemen now, the two plainclothes, off to harass someone else.
[00:23:36.485 --> 00:23:43.270]  Um, and uh, it's just, it's not a very nice feeling, and you know, and I didn't feel as threatened this time, uh, because we had another shadow.
[00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:44.791]  So they took you and stuck you?
[00:23:45.392 --> 00:23:46.773]  Sir, so they took you and put you in a car?
[00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:50.713]  So they took you then and put you in the police car?
[00:23:51.474 --> 00:23:53.736]  They pressured me into the police car.
[00:23:53.797 --> 00:23:54.998]  I don't really know my rights.
[00:23:55.018 --> 00:23:56.620]  I have no idea about this kind of thing.
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.341]  I really don't.
[00:23:57.381 --> 00:24:02.268]  Yes, when armed men of the government... Are these local police or federal police?
[00:24:04.714 --> 00:24:06.656]  I think by and large they're local.
[00:24:06.976 --> 00:24:13.824]  Yeah, okay, well when police with guns put their hands on you and stick you in a police car and take you to a police station, you're under arrest.
[00:24:13.844 --> 00:24:17.989]  And I'm not mad at you here, but I think you're going through some crime stop or some double think here.
[00:24:18.009 --> 00:24:23.035]  Kind of like when, you know, Winston's neighbor's being tortured by O'Brien but he still thinks he kind of deserves it.
[00:24:23.415 --> 00:24:24.757]  No, you're being violated.
[00:24:25.137 --> 00:24:29.178]  I mean, you keep saying you've done nothing wrong and that you're a small problem.
[00:24:29.758 --> 00:24:35.280]  They are the problem in supposedly free Europe coming over and grabbing you.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.641]  Now, Jim Tucker told us they've arrested a bunch of other journalists.
[00:24:39.161 --> 00:24:39.941]  Have you seen that?
[00:24:41.081 --> 00:24:41.581]  I haven't, no.
[00:24:41.622 --> 00:24:44.822]  I've not really had much contact with anyone else here today.
[00:24:44.842 --> 00:24:45.803]  I had breakfast with Jim.
[00:24:46.743 --> 00:24:48.903]  But apart from that, I've not really seen anyone.
[00:24:49.144 --> 00:24:53.365]  I've just been keeping myself to myself, writing up another... I wrote up the account of last night.
[00:24:54.699 --> 00:25:06.203]  I was actually going to write tomorrow, well tonight, I was going to write about just the kind of strange, surreal and farcical nature of people arriving in ultimate privacy
[00:25:06.653 --> 00:25:09.634]  You know, keeping the windows tinted, keeping the shades down.
[00:25:10.174 --> 00:25:11.655]  You know, what on earth do they think they're going on?
[00:25:11.995 --> 00:25:13.015]  What is in their minds?
[00:25:13.395 --> 00:25:15.976]  It's so pathetic that they're having this meeting.
[00:25:15.996 --> 00:25:16.876]  It's kind of pathetic.
[00:25:16.896 --> 00:25:19.077]  You know, you have different feelings about it.
[00:25:19.097 --> 00:25:19.917]  You might be angry.
[00:25:20.277 --> 00:25:22.518]  You might be insulted that they're having this meeting in private.
[00:25:22.778 --> 00:25:24.398]  I kind of find it a little bit tragic.
[00:25:24.778 --> 00:25:25.919]  Mr. Skelton!
[00:25:25.959 --> 00:25:26.799]  Mr. Skelton!
[00:25:27.119 --> 00:25:30.380]  They've stolen $14.8 trillion in seven months of U.S.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.220]  taxpayer money.
[00:25:31.481 --> 00:25:33.221]  The global banking ministers are meeting.
[00:25:33.441 --> 00:25:35.922]  They've stolen $10 trillion from Europe and England together.
[00:25:37.242 --> 00:25:39.804]  It would be tragic if they didn't control the military.
[00:25:40.064 --> 00:25:42.505]  We have Bilderberg Group, Club of Rome documents, sir.
[00:25:42.746 --> 00:25:44.947]  They're calling for world population reduction.
[00:25:45.407 --> 00:25:52.771]  They're calling for world taxes to enslave us and to quote streamline our lifestyles, lower our standard of living.
[00:25:53.031 --> 00:25:54.612]  They want one child policy.
[00:25:55.012 --> 00:25:57.414]  They're meeting, they're mobsters.
[00:25:57.694 --> 00:26:02.717]  So of course, but they're mobsters that the state and the government work for and protect.
[00:26:03.157 --> 00:26:11.342]  You've got 150 world leaders, kings, queens, banker heads, government ministers, meeting in secret, violating the Logan Act, the U.S.
[00:26:11.362 --> 00:26:18.446]  ministers, and then you, the London Guardian, is it the Guardian in the top 5 newspapers or is it the top 10?
[00:26:19.887 --> 00:26:23.369]  Yeah, I mean, it's one of the big broadsheets, so it's, you know, top 5.
[00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:26.151]  But, I mean, the London Guardian is the biggest paper in Europe.
[00:26:27.301 --> 00:26:28.704]  I mean, I know that, because I've been to Europe.
[00:26:29.345 --> 00:26:30.908]  No, that's the paper you see everywhere.
[00:26:30.948 --> 00:26:36.338]  No, I mean, no, I mean... In fact, pull out... I mean, I should just point out, I should point out, I'm not really, well, I'm not a journalist.
[00:26:36.458 --> 00:26:37.480]  I'm a, you know, I'm a writer.
[00:26:38.337 --> 00:26:41.379]  I write jokes about Amy Whitehouse for a living.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:47.864]  That's why they sent you, because they thought you wouldn't be able to recognize what was really happening, but I think you're a smart guy.
[00:26:48.385 --> 00:26:49.926]  With respect, that's not what happened.
[00:26:51.027 --> 00:26:53.909]  I was aware that they weren't going to send anyone, and no one was writing about this.
[00:26:54.189 --> 00:27:01.374]  So I approached them, and I said, under the cover of wanting to make a few jokes about it, I said, why don't I go over and cover this?
[00:27:01.414 --> 00:27:02.555]  They said, OK, that sounds funny.
[00:27:02.855 --> 00:27:07.439]  So I've started to be able to, just I hope in my small way,
[00:27:07.998 --> 00:27:15.824]  Raise a little bit of awareness about this because you would not believe the lack of awareness and the lack of just basic knowledge or even caring about
[00:27:16.443 --> 00:27:19.765]  About this situation and about, you know, global power structures.
[00:27:20.105 --> 00:27:21.946]  There is just such ignorance.
[00:27:22.066 --> 00:27:22.667]  It's unbelievable.
[00:27:22.727 --> 00:27:23.767]  Yeah, let me throw this in.
[00:27:24.128 --> 00:27:27.149]  They just walked in with a bunch of mainstream articles out of Greece, England, you name it.
[00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:32.532]  Yes, there are members of the State Department and others on record meeting in Greece this weekend.
[00:27:32.873 --> 00:27:40.297]  So all these Obama people are going over to Greece, but then the news won't say they're there because it's a felony.
[00:27:40.597 --> 00:27:41.858]  Now Rick Perry, in 2007,
[00:27:44.239 --> 00:27:47.621]  He's the first to ever arrogantly tell the Dallas Morning News he was going to Bilderberg.
[00:27:48.601 --> 00:27:49.142]  Right, right.
[00:27:49.242 --> 00:27:50.883]  And he went to Istanbul, Turkey.
[00:27:51.723 --> 00:27:58.226]  Now, the article yesterday that you were in kind of said you were going to Bilderberg to see if it existed.
[00:27:58.807 --> 00:28:00.548]  Let me ask you now, does it exist?
[00:28:01.708 --> 00:28:02.028]  Oh, yeah.
[00:28:03.049 --> 00:28:04.350]  Um, yeah.
[00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:05.790]  I mean, do those police... 100,000%.
[00:28:06.071 --> 00:28:09.152]  Do those police exist that took you to jail?
[00:28:10.153 --> 00:28:10.713]  Well, yeah.
[00:28:10.873 --> 00:28:12.314]  Well, I'm calling from the police station.
[00:28:13.381 --> 00:28:16.142]  You know how many times I've been in a police station in my life?
[00:28:16.242 --> 00:28:17.282]  Twice.
[00:28:17.662 --> 00:28:19.242]  Both days here at Bilderberg.
[00:28:19.722 --> 00:28:20.803]  You know, I've never been arrested.
[00:28:20.903 --> 00:28:22.323]  I've never had a crossword with a policeman.
[00:28:22.723 --> 00:28:23.443]  And now suddenly this.
[00:28:23.483 --> 00:28:29.965]  Yeah, but that's what Winston Smith's upstairs neighbor, when he brings him into the cell and he goes, they got you too?
[00:28:30.005 --> 00:28:31.605]  And he's like, I don't know why I'm here.
[00:28:31.625 --> 00:28:32.625]  I must have done something.
[00:28:32.825 --> 00:28:33.585]  I'm sure I deserve it.
[00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:34.746]  My son turned me in.
[00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:35.866]  I'm so proud of him.
[00:28:36.186 --> 00:28:39.807]  I mean, do you understand that that's the level we've reached?
[00:28:40.007 --> 00:28:41.447]  I hope I'm not coming across as that.
[00:28:41.787 --> 00:28:45.830]  I hope I'm not saying I've done something wrong here.
[00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:51.534]  What I am saying, though, is that you've been doing this for years.
[00:28:51.775 --> 00:28:52.875]  This is my first Bilderberg.
[00:28:52.956 --> 00:28:54.076]  I know I'm a bit naive.
[00:28:54.176 --> 00:28:54.617]  I know that.
[00:28:55.097 --> 00:28:55.838]  I appreciate that.
[00:28:56.818 --> 00:28:59.320]  It's been a real eye-opener for me.
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:04.044]  It's just been an extraordinary experience, and it's made me more
[00:29:04.804 --> 00:29:08.808]  Aware of the seriousness of the situation because there are people here taking this thing very seriously.
[00:29:09.068 --> 00:29:09.909]  So I think everyone should.
[00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:11.551]  Are they going to let you go?
[00:29:11.571 --> 00:29:13.633]  Well, do you know what?
[00:29:13.653 --> 00:29:13.953]  I don't know.
[00:29:13.973 --> 00:29:14.874]  They're just sitting about.
[00:29:14.894 --> 00:29:16.156]  It's strange.
[00:29:16.176 --> 00:29:17.136]  I'm just sort of here.
[00:29:18.226 --> 00:29:19.366]  I don't really know what's going on.
[00:29:19.426 --> 00:29:25.308]  Well, Obama says he supports indefinite detention like Bush, so maybe this is the last time we'll ever talk to you.
[00:29:25.548 --> 00:29:26.409]  Maybe that's just all.
[00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:28.269]  Where'd Mr. Skelton go?
[00:29:28.309 --> 00:29:29.229]  Where did Charlie go?
[00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:30.190]  You know, he disappeared!
[00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.650]  It's part of freedom!
[00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:33.651]  Give my love to mom and dad.
[00:29:33.991 --> 00:29:35.871]  Yeah, well, hey, in fact, this may be the last time.
[00:29:35.891 --> 00:29:38.552]  You want to say bye to your family, maybe?
[00:29:39.032 --> 00:29:40.373]  I'm not going to do anything so chilling.
[00:29:41.253 --> 00:29:42.393]  But, I mean, you know, this is freedom.
[00:29:42.453 --> 00:29:47.275]  I mean, you know... Yeah, no, look, this is also on a serious note.
[00:29:47.662 --> 00:29:55.569]  This is the first time I've experienced in a very, very real, visceral way the withdrawal of freedoms.
[00:29:56.751 --> 00:30:09.182]  Just the other day, on a related note, I found out that the EU had basically limited the number of seeds that you can sell legally to members of the public.
[00:30:10.097 --> 00:30:13.058]  We keep telling listeners that all over they're buying up the heirloom seeds, putting them in U.N.
[00:30:13.098 --> 00:30:13.719]  armored vaults.
[00:30:13.979 --> 00:30:14.759]  You can hardly get them!
[00:30:31.607 --> 00:30:32.647]  There are a bunch of U.S.
[00:30:32.667 --> 00:30:35.689]  cities in Oklahoma, Oregon, you name it.
[00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:40.971]  One of them's Tulsa, Oklahoma, where they want to make you get a license to have a garden.
[00:30:41.491 --> 00:30:43.012]  I mean, we're in a prison, folks!
[00:30:43.052 --> 00:30:44.432]  These people mean business!
[00:30:44.612 --> 00:30:46.193]  I'm sorry, go ahead about your point about the seeds.
[00:30:47.033 --> 00:30:59.118]  Well, no, it's just that I think that was one of the first occasions where I suddenly felt the hand of the EU limiting me as a citizen, wanting to do a perfectly innocent, in fact, good thing.
[00:30:59.588 --> 00:31:01.849]  You know, I was thinking, this is ridiculous.
[00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:03.469]  It's an absurd situation.
[00:31:03.489 --> 00:31:04.890]  What type of seeds were they?
[00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:06.330]  Maybe they could be used as weapons.
[00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:07.011]  Al-Qaeda.
[00:31:07.411 --> 00:31:13.153]  We have SWAT teams here raiding aloe vera plantations because it's evil.
[00:31:13.193 --> 00:31:13.993]  It helps for burns.
[00:31:14.033 --> 00:31:16.134]  Maybe they're protecting me from these terrible seeds.
[00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:18.574]  Maybe, you know, I don't know.
[00:31:18.594 --> 00:31:20.155]  We're laughing, but it's actually...
[00:31:20.595 --> 00:31:30.801]  When it comes down to things like DNA, genetics, and seeds, and ownership of water, these are massive, fundamental pillars of human life.
[00:31:31.161 --> 00:31:37.225]  Sir, for 36 years, they've taken in the UK, Australia, the US, Canada, New Zealand, your blood at birth.
[00:31:37.685 --> 00:31:40.667]  I had the secret documents on this 14 years ago, now it's mainstream news.
[00:31:40.707 --> 00:31:42.428]  They go, yeah, we take your blood illegally.
[00:31:42.448 --> 00:31:43.869]  If you don't like it, we got weapons.
[00:31:44.349 --> 00:31:51.172]  Now, sir, I'm trying to understand here, we really appreciate you joining us, a London Guardian reporter from the police station, there where you're being held.
[00:31:51.712 --> 00:31:53.633]  Can you tell us what police station you're being held in?
[00:31:53.653 --> 00:31:55.354]  In case this is the last time you're on the scene.
[00:31:55.374 --> 00:31:59.996]  Well, I guess it's, I can't even, I can't even say it's, the one that sounded a bit like Volugamini.
[00:32:00.556 --> 00:32:05.899]  It's where the police, it's the police station local to the hotel resort that they've taken over for Bilderberg.
[00:32:06.319 --> 00:32:08.360]  And the hotel is located where outside Athens?
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:13.782]  Yeah, it's about 20 kilometers outside Athens on the Riviera, they call it.
[00:32:14.198 --> 00:32:16.520]  Beginning with V, and I can't say it, for Luke Minney or something.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:25.687]  So that's where I am, and you know, I can see that... I just sat at the side of the road for a couple of hours just watching the... Actually, I can see where I was sitting from here.
[00:32:26.928 --> 00:32:30.511]  Watching the delegates come round the roundabout and zoom in with their police escort.
[00:32:31.071 --> 00:32:32.693]  Sir, I want to continue to talk to you.
[00:32:32.713 --> 00:32:33.914]  We've got to take this break.
[00:32:33.954 --> 00:32:34.694]  Back in three minutes.
[00:32:34.734 --> 00:32:35.435]  Can you stay with us?
[00:32:35.475 --> 00:32:36.155]  Okay.
[00:32:36.175 --> 00:32:36.896]  Charlie Skelton.
[00:32:36.916 --> 00:32:37.777]  But I want to find out...
[00:32:38.922 --> 00:32:40.463]  Because this may be a reason to arrest you.
[00:32:40.483 --> 00:32:41.904]  I want to find out what seeds.
[00:32:41.924 --> 00:32:42.665]  Were they carrot?
[00:32:42.825 --> 00:32:43.685]  Were they tomato?
[00:32:44.106 --> 00:32:44.986]  Were they potato?
[00:32:45.787 --> 00:32:47.888]  Because you may get put on a terror list, sir.
[00:32:48.589 --> 00:32:49.710]  This guy's hardcore, folks.
[00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.111]  He's trying to buy seeds.
[00:32:51.451 --> 00:32:51.891]  Be right back.
[00:32:52.712 --> 00:32:53.512]  Oh my God, I'm scared.
[00:32:56.354 --> 00:32:57.275]  We're on the march.
[00:32:57.755 --> 00:32:59.356]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:33:00.277 --> 00:33:02.979]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:05.814 --> 00:33:07.416]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:33:07.516 --> 00:33:12.122]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:33:12.242 --> 00:33:15.006]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:33:15.226 --> 00:33:18.090]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:24.118]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:33:24.338 --> 00:33:27.320]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation that you need.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:34.485]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:33:34.565 --> 00:33:37.687]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:33:37.847 --> 00:33:38.047]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:33:38.107 --> 00:33:39.388]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:46.072]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:34:12.709 --> 00:34:18.052]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:34:18.593 --> 00:34:24.776]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:34:25.077 --> 00:34:26.898]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:34:27.058 --> 00:34:29.439]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:34:29.519 --> 00:34:40.406]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:34:42.708 --> 00:34:43.969]  It's not about left or right.
[00:34:44.369 --> 00:34:45.749]  It's about a one world government.
[00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:52.572]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:35:39.408 --> 00:35:43.209]  Pepper spray, mace, animal repellents, stun guns, and tasers.
[00:35:43.449 --> 00:35:49.810]  Pepperspray.com also carries a large assortment of products for personal, home, child, and pet safety.
[00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:51.231]  We will not be forgotten.
[00:35:51.271 --> 00:35:52.192]  We won't be left behind.
[00:36:17.382 --> 00:36:29.006]  You know, I'm not joking when I get up on air and I say that what you're seeing in Europe, England, the United States, Canada, is tyranny.
[00:36:29.246 --> 00:36:31.386]  We're one step away from him just disappearing.
[00:36:31.406 --> 00:36:36.168]  When I was in Canada, they said, you're here to ship drugs in, aren't you?
[00:36:36.188 --> 00:36:36.848]  And I was like, no.
[00:36:36.868 --> 00:36:42.550]  And they said, listen, we find one porno picture on those computers, you're going to get years and years in prison.
[00:36:43.612 --> 00:36:45.073]  And I said, these are our office computers.
[00:36:45.153 --> 00:36:46.494]  And I said, what, like illegal porn?
[00:36:46.514 --> 00:36:47.414]  He goes, no, anything.
[00:36:48.015 --> 00:36:49.596]  Topless girl, you're going to prison.
[00:36:50.276 --> 00:36:52.518]  So they spent hours and hours searching them.
[00:36:52.558 --> 00:36:57.280]  Thank God none of the office computers, because who hadn't clicked on something by accident or on purpose or whatever?
[00:36:57.581 --> 00:36:59.122]  You know, porn's everywhere on the web.
[00:36:59.242 --> 00:37:00.282]  None of it on our computers.
[00:37:02.264 --> 00:37:04.885]  And they were cussing at me, screaming at me.
[00:37:04.905 --> 00:37:07.127]  It sounds like the Greeks aren't that mean.
[00:37:08.267 --> 00:37:09.828]  They didn't shove on him and grab him, he said.
[00:37:10.549 --> 00:37:12.510]  But that's where this is going.
[00:37:13.752 --> 00:37:16.994]  I mean, I was there being told how I was going to be going to a Toronto prison.
[00:37:18.035 --> 00:37:29.662]  Going back to our guest, London Guardian reporter, he's filed two stories now, one about his arrest yesterday and one about how he was going and, you know, breaking it down.
[00:37:31.524 --> 00:37:34.145]  And we go back now to Charlie Skelton.
[00:37:34.505 --> 00:37:37.067]  Charlie, you're in the police department right now.
[00:37:37.728 --> 00:37:40.269]  Are you miles away from the meeting spot of Bilderberg?
[00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.230]  Hello?
[00:37:42.751 --> 00:37:43.011]  Yes, sir.
[00:37:44.335 --> 00:37:45.515]  Sorry, I couldn't hear yours.
[00:37:45.855 --> 00:37:47.216]  There was loud Greek voices.
[00:37:47.336 --> 00:37:47.616]  Sorry.
[00:37:48.256 --> 00:37:50.817]  So you're just stuck in the police department and that's the end of it?
[00:37:52.497 --> 00:37:55.618]  Well, I've got a feeling I'm about to be waved off.
[00:37:56.178 --> 00:38:02.020]  What would mean, A, being no threat whatsoever, and B, no one seems to know what's going on.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.160]  What type of questions?
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.841]  Because they're so compartmentalized.
[00:38:05.541 --> 00:38:06.161]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:38:06.561 --> 00:38:10.042]  I was going to pass you one of the policemen, if you'd like.
[00:38:10.615 --> 00:38:11.476]  Oh, I'd like to talk to him.
[00:38:11.516 --> 00:38:12.016]  What's his name?
[00:38:12.076 --> 00:38:13.157]  Yeah, okay, it's a lady.
[00:38:13.177 --> 00:38:18.260]  It's the one I described as... Yeah, it's the one I described as the Christina Aguilera.
[00:38:18.541 --> 00:38:19.802]  I'll put her on.
[00:38:20.042 --> 00:38:21.823]  Oh, okay, lovely Greek lady.
[00:38:22.443 --> 00:38:23.524]  Oh, she's gone away.
[00:38:23.544 --> 00:38:25.606]  Oh, how annoying.
[00:38:25.746 --> 00:38:27.227]  She doesn't want to talk to you.
[00:38:27.307 --> 00:38:33.391]  Sir, look, more importantly, can you tell us about the EU law and being registered to be able to buy seeds?
[00:38:33.772 --> 00:38:35.673]  Can you tell me... I've been released.
[00:38:36.033 --> 00:38:36.874]  Here we go.
[00:38:37.034 --> 00:38:37.674]  I'm off.
[00:38:37.714 --> 00:38:38.435]  Go, my friend, go.
[00:38:39.542 --> 00:38:40.443]  Okay, thank you very much.
[00:38:40.463 --> 00:38:40.903]  But no, no, no.
[00:38:41.023 --> 00:38:43.605]  Ask him if he'll be arrested again if you take photos of Oldenburg.
[00:38:43.705 --> 00:38:44.005]  Ask him.
[00:38:45.086 --> 00:38:45.647]  Oh, he's gone.
[00:38:46.547 --> 00:38:46.807]  Hold on.
[00:38:47.868 --> 00:38:48.749]  Actually, that's a good question.
[00:38:48.769 --> 00:38:49.249]  I will ask that.
[00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:50.110]  Hold on.
[00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:51.851]  I'm going back into the train station.
[00:38:52.251 --> 00:38:52.612]  That's good.
[00:38:52.632 --> 00:38:53.793]  You need to have that attitude.
[00:38:53.813 --> 00:38:55.214]  They're the ones engaging in crimes.
[00:38:55.934 --> 00:38:56.815]  See, he feels guilty.
[00:38:56.835 --> 00:38:57.755]  He's like, go, my friend.
[00:39:04.186 --> 00:39:08.527]  Listen, if you have to, hold the phone down by your side and they won't take it as threatening.
[00:39:09.308 --> 00:39:11.368]  Just hold the phone down by your side, Mr. Skelton.
[00:39:12.328 --> 00:39:18.310]  I need to ask one quick question.
[00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:21.891]  Will I be arrested again if I take photographs of Bilderberg?
[00:39:21.931 --> 00:39:23.972]  Can I pass you over to Alex Jones?
[00:39:25.985 --> 00:39:28.146]  I don't speak.
[00:39:28.266 --> 00:39:29.446]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:39:30.227 --> 00:39:30.667]  I don't speak.
[00:39:30.987 --> 00:39:31.947]  No, you speak very good English.
[00:39:31.987 --> 00:39:32.587]  You speak very good.
[00:39:32.727 --> 00:39:33.348]  My friend Alex.
[00:39:33.388 --> 00:39:33.928]  I don't speak.
[00:39:34.028 --> 00:39:35.028]  I don't speak on the telephone.
[00:39:35.088 --> 00:39:36.009]  It's not allowed to me.
[00:39:36.049 --> 00:39:37.329]  Ask her the question again.
[00:39:37.409 --> 00:39:38.229]  Okay, what can I clarify?
[00:39:38.249 --> 00:39:39.970]  Am I allowed to take photographs of Bill Bidette?
[00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:40.330]  Am I?
[00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:40.970]  Am I allowed?
[00:39:51.864 --> 00:39:54.366]  No, I just wanted to ask a question.
[00:39:54.446 --> 00:39:56.107]  Am I allowed to take photographs of Bilderberg?
[00:39:56.727 --> 00:39:57.468]  She doesn't understand.
[00:39:57.628 --> 00:40:01.210]  Ask her if you'll be arrested again if you go to the same place.
[00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.810]  Oh, don't worry.
[00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:02.611]  Anyway, say hi to Alex.
[00:40:13.112 --> 00:40:14.793]  Hello, hello, how are you doing?
[00:40:15.334 --> 00:40:17.775]  I know it's a police station, I'm quite often here.
[00:40:18.355 --> 00:40:23.419]  Is there freedom of the press in Greece or are you a fascist country?
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:33.765]  Can he take photos of foreign banker rulers who are bankrupting you now and will enslave your family's future police officers?
[00:40:34.786 --> 00:40:37.067]  Police officers, do you serve Hitler?
[00:40:38.168 --> 00:40:39.389]  Do you serve Stalin?
[00:40:42.425 --> 00:40:43.626]  I'm a free man!
[00:40:43.646 --> 00:40:45.207]  Second time freedom!
[00:40:59.718 --> 00:41:03.822]  You know what, I would go down there and I would say, I've been told it's okay for me to do this.
[00:41:04.142 --> 00:41:06.965]  Because them releasing you, I would file a formal complaint.
[00:41:07.245 --> 00:41:08.006]  This is what you ought to do.
[00:41:08.366 --> 00:41:12.109]  I would go to the British Embassy and I would make an issue out of this London Guardian.
[00:41:12.129 --> 00:41:17.714]  I mean, you're a British citizen, our subject, and you supposedly have these rights and you're in the European Union.
[00:41:17.734 --> 00:41:23.839]  I would complain to the European Union Embassy and I would say the freedom of the press is being violated by a bunch of criminal bankers meeting.
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:25.060]  This is a big deal.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.341]  You've got to file complaints, man!
[00:41:27.512 --> 00:41:29.754]  I'll tell you what, for you, I will file a complaint, okay?
[00:41:30.374 --> 00:41:31.175]  Well, for all of us!
[00:41:32.295 --> 00:41:33.216]  Yes, it is for me.
[00:41:33.676 --> 00:41:34.937]  It is for my future as well.
[00:41:36.178 --> 00:41:40.081]  Yeah, no, I mean, I'm interested to see what's going to happen to anyone.
[00:41:40.101 --> 00:41:50.788]  I mean, there's a growing number of people here from the oppressive media, and I think there's a few just generally interested parties turning out, but a couple of protesters, I know, I spoke to one guy who's going to be here.
[00:41:50.808 --> 00:41:54.671]  I mean, I'm just interested to see what's going to happen and how hard the Greek police are going to be
[00:41:55.649 --> 00:41:56.911]  Well, I saw photos of Lennon Guardian.
[00:41:56.931 --> 00:42:00.456]  Were those your photos where they look very agitated and they're surrounding you?
[00:42:10.925 --> 00:42:11.605]  Yes, that was.
[00:42:11.626 --> 00:42:13.487]  That's the one that really kicked things off, that photo.
[00:42:13.667 --> 00:42:16.048]  And you say they were grabbing and shouting at you then.
[00:42:16.068 --> 00:42:19.611]  That one officer looks like he's 12 years old.
[00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:21.012]  What happened?
[00:42:21.032 --> 00:42:22.833]  He was a nasty little fellow.
[00:42:22.893 --> 00:42:24.974]  I wouldn't mind if he drove his car into the marina.
[00:42:26.655 --> 00:42:27.156]  I didn't like him.
[00:42:27.196 --> 00:42:27.916]  I liked some of the others.
[00:42:27.936 --> 00:42:28.416]  They were fine.
[00:42:28.456 --> 00:42:30.778]  But you know, it's very strange.
[00:42:31.438 --> 00:42:34.460]  You know what the situation does is it makes bad people out of good people.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.702]  Operative word, little fellow.
[00:42:36.742 --> 00:42:38.423]  He has a Napoleon complex, probably.
[00:42:39.562 --> 00:42:41.403]  Yeah, I didn't like him at all.
[00:42:41.443 --> 00:42:41.943]  He's a bully.
[00:42:43.944 --> 00:42:45.725]  Anyway, so, yes, I'm free.
[00:42:45.925 --> 00:42:47.426]  Well, that was a thought crime right there.
[00:42:47.466 --> 00:42:58.312]  Did you know that your own Home Secretary, Jackie Smith, is banning people who criticize the government or criticize open borders from coming to England?
[00:42:58.672 --> 00:43:04.475]  See, in the future, and they do this in Canada, when you show up, they say you're a thought criminal, so that's why you get arrested.
[00:43:04.795 --> 00:43:06.036]  I mean, is that good?
[00:43:06.376 --> 00:43:07.817]  I thought England had the Magna Carta 1215.
[00:43:10.833 --> 00:43:11.994]  12.15, almost lunch.
[00:43:12.495 --> 00:43:20.761]  Do you know what, I'm only, I have to say to you Alex, I'm only just waking up to what's going on.
[00:43:20.821 --> 00:43:32.870]  I really am one of those people who's taking their first tentative footsteps into awareness of a world which isn't pretty and it isn't necessarily being run for the right reasons by the right people.
[00:43:32.991 --> 00:43:34.812]  And you know, I'm just learning and I've spent
[00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:39.280]  I've just, I've been twice in a police station for doing absolutely nothing.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:40.200]  I mean, really nothing.
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:44.721]  And you know, it's a wake-up call for me and I hope it's a wake-up call for some other people.
[00:43:45.161 --> 00:43:53.303]  And I, on a personal note, I'd like to thank you for the work you're doing in, you know, I mean, literally waking people up out of the slumber that they are in.
[00:43:54.063 --> 00:43:57.704]  Well, I appreciate you and I was talking to Paul Watson, who you emailed.
[00:43:57.724 --> 00:44:01.144]  We've got your email saying that you are aware of the radio show and have listened to it.
[00:44:01.424 --> 00:44:04.145]  How long have you tuned into the radio show or seen the videos?
[00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:11.034]  I mean, my wife, Hannah, she's an even bigger fan of you than I am.
[00:44:12.535 --> 00:44:14.117]  She started getting me into this.
[00:44:14.177 --> 00:44:19.482]  We started looking at some... We watched Loose Change, you know, that's another key.
[00:44:19.742 --> 00:44:24.246]  We watched your... Oh, I forgot the name of it.
[00:44:24.266 --> 00:44:26.368]  Global Conspiracy Countdown, whatever it's called.
[00:44:26.388 --> 00:44:28.129]  It's not terrible, I forgot the name of your movie.
[00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:31.112]  And a couple of those...
[00:44:33.365 --> 00:44:37.168]  Those videos, started looking at that, started reading, started listening to the radio show.
[00:44:37.788 --> 00:44:47.955]  You know, you've got some really interesting guests on and, you know, you hear some new ideas and different perspectives and, you know, it's... I mean, thank God we've got the internet now.
[00:44:48.015 --> 00:44:53.719]  I don't know how long we're going to have it for in the way that it, you know, the level of freedom of communication we have at this second.
[00:44:54.319 --> 00:44:55.640]  I don't know, that scares me.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:01.443]  But, you know, at the moment, this is a time of awakening, I think, for everyone.
[00:45:02.731 --> 00:45:08.177]  I genuinely believe that, and I don't know how many people are going to, you know, wake up.
[00:45:08.457 --> 00:45:10.819]  Sorry, I keep saying that, but it is the appropriate metaphor, I think.
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.323]  I don't know how many are going to, and let's just hope it's enough.
[00:45:14.963 --> 00:45:23.372]  Well, the London Guardian needs to make a big deal out of this, because, you know, we have the Times of London, we have Haaretz, we have all these big papers.
[00:45:23.392 --> 00:45:25.414]  In fact, I'm going to read those later on air.
[00:45:26.846 --> 00:45:37.148]  I thought I'd printed the Heretz story, just Google Bilderberg and Heretz, or Heratz, and it's one of the stories down, and it says, global elite meeting to chart future of world government.
[00:45:37.689 --> 00:45:41.129]  All these news articles I'm reading this morning and today, they're now admitting it.
[00:45:41.169 --> 00:45:47.751]  This is a big deal, because in the past, I had the New York Times just eight years ago say I was insane, it didn't exist.
[00:45:48.191 --> 00:45:51.292]  Bohemian Grove didn't exist, Bilderberg group didn't exist.
[00:45:51.992 --> 00:45:58.007]  When the groups had already written books and bragged about how they existed and German presidents had written about it and prime ministers had written about it.
[00:45:59.812 --> 00:46:05.517]  To now have it be all over the European press, all over the British press, but not in the U.S.
[00:46:05.577 --> 00:46:05.957]  press.
[00:46:06.458 --> 00:46:09.441]  Last year was the biggest blackout we'd seen in a decade.
[00:46:10.562 --> 00:46:14.505]  Newspapers showed up but said they weren't allowed to really write about it, so there was no U.S.
[00:46:14.565 --> 00:46:14.825]  press.
[00:46:15.286 --> 00:46:24.154]  Finally, Politico this year did a Bilderberg report dealing with my film, The Obama Deception, and how Barack Obama
[00:46:25.479 --> 00:46:34.664]  How Barack Obama was clearly there, and how they helped kidnap the airplane full of media telling him he was going to Chicago on his plane, but he didn't, and he went to Brook Street.
[00:46:35.004 --> 00:46:39.126]  I mean, not Brook Street, he went to the Chantilly, Virginia Marriott, and Brook Street was 2006.
[00:46:39.286 --> 00:46:42.087]  So I would hope you get some of that in your article.
[00:46:42.468 --> 00:46:49.531]  There's a history of intimidation, shooting at Jim Tucker, that there's a history of threats, and that
[00:46:51.252 --> 00:46:55.615]  What does this say about the global elite that they're meeting in secret, setting the financial future?
[00:46:55.635 --> 00:47:05.482]  You know, the Bilderberg Group has leaked, and the BBC has even reported, that they set up the European Union covertly, that they're setting up... I mean, this is a fact, sir.
[00:47:05.583 --> 00:47:06.483]  This is the group.
[00:47:06.803 --> 00:47:15.630]  If we arrested these people right now, and they've committed public crimes, most of them have, or at least started an investigation, the whole New World Order could end.
[00:47:16.786 --> 00:47:17.006]  Yeah.
[00:47:17.426 --> 00:47:30.736]  I mean, what's fascinating, and it's such an obvious point that it's been made many times, but it's worth making again, is if these guys were doing something benign, if they were trying to organise a softball game or how to cure cancer, they'd do it in an upstairs room at Starbucks.
[00:47:31.076 --> 00:47:35.079]  You know, there's no need to hide good acts away from the public.
[00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:36.920]  There's no need to hide good intentions.
[00:47:37.741 --> 00:47:45.346]  You know, it's such an obvious point, but I don't, you know, they've got a police helicopter flying around and there's tinted windows and
[00:47:45.954 --> 00:47:47.635]  And, you know, why?
[00:47:48.696 --> 00:47:56.321]  Well, we all know why, but if it was all so benign, I get the feeling it would be, you know, just a little bit softer around the edges.
[00:47:56.662 --> 00:47:58.083]  How would you like being shot at?
[00:47:59.423 --> 00:48:04.327]  Well, it's, you know, I pretty much got my fingers crossed that doesn't happen.
[00:48:05.548 --> 00:48:06.328]  Well, they do that.
[00:48:06.348 --> 00:48:09.410]  They also call your wife just in case they do it.
[00:48:09.711 --> 00:48:11.192]  This happens to everybody's wives.
[00:48:12.032 --> 00:48:13.013]  They'll call up and go,
[00:48:15.495 --> 00:48:17.297]  Hi, is Charlie there?
[00:48:19.479 --> 00:48:20.580]  No, I'm serious.
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:21.901]  I'd call her before they do it.
[00:48:22.662 --> 00:48:24.684]  They do this to most reporters.
[00:48:24.704 --> 00:48:25.164]  No, it's serious.
[00:48:25.224 --> 00:48:27.787]  I understand, but it sounds like a joke when I do it.
[00:48:27.807 --> 00:48:29.168]  The point is, hi, is Charlie there?
[00:48:29.489 --> 00:48:30.530]  No, he's not going to leave a message.
[00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:32.111]  Well, yeah, who's this?
[00:48:32.271 --> 00:48:33.953]  Well, this is his wife, Mrs. Skelton.
[00:48:34.473 --> 00:48:35.334]  That's impossible.
[00:48:35.374 --> 00:48:39.739]  I'm pregnant with his baby and we're engaged.
[00:48:40.629 --> 00:48:43.791]  And then the woman will start crying and saying, well, I'll give you my number, you know.
[00:48:44.352 --> 00:48:49.555]  And then they'll call up, if you have a little dog in the backyard, they'll say, I'm watching your little white dog right now.
[00:48:50.116 --> 00:48:51.037]  You're like, excuse me?
[00:48:51.597 --> 00:48:56.440]  And then your wife looks out the window and the dog's there and goes, yeah, and that's when I'm going to stab you and rape you.
[00:48:57.461 --> 00:48:58.722]  So, I mean, it's the government.
[00:48:58.742 --> 00:49:00.703]  They're watching the dog while they do it.
[00:49:00.723 --> 00:49:01.664]  I mean, it's real, bud.
[00:49:01.704 --> 00:49:03.165]  These people call your women up.
[00:49:04.412 --> 00:49:08.815]  So, I just want you to know, these are hardcore criminals you're dealing with.
[00:49:08.876 --> 00:49:09.976]  I mean, take Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[00:49:09.996 --> 00:49:17.482]  He wrote a book two years ago bragging that what we already knew, he funded Pol Pot to kill 35% of the Cambodian population.
[00:49:18.003 --> 00:49:23.307]  These guys, these guys, Mr. Skelton, write books bragging about who they've murdered.
[00:49:24.127 --> 00:49:24.768]  You understand, Sokes?
[00:49:24.948 --> 00:49:28.471]  It's a very interesting point, what you're making there.
[00:49:28.791 --> 00:49:31.313]  A lot of the documentation, a lot of the ideology
[00:49:32.254 --> 00:49:36.478]  Behind, you know, the shift towards globalization.
[00:49:37.198 --> 00:49:38.039]  It's been printed.
[00:49:38.079 --> 00:49:39.180]  It's out in the open.
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:40.241]  It's kind of so big.
[00:49:40.381 --> 00:49:44.825]  The point I was making, I think, in one of my pieces, it is so big and so much out in the open, people don't see it.
[00:49:44.845 --> 00:49:46.346]  They're not reading the right books.
[00:49:46.366 --> 00:49:50.189]  They're not seeing the thinking that's behind it, which is, you know, it's been published.
[00:49:50.809 --> 00:49:52.811]  You know, there are papers, there are books, you know.
[00:49:54.532 --> 00:49:56.914]  The ideology is out there for everyone to see.
[00:49:57.315 --> 00:49:58.736]  And also, you know, if you can
[00:49:59.511 --> 00:50:03.734]  For one moment, take your eyes off, you know, American Idol and The X Factor.
[00:50:04.715 --> 00:50:09.759]  You can see changes happening ever so slightly, incrementally, all the time, around you.
[00:50:10.079 --> 00:50:20.848]  But the problem is, people just don't have to... It's becoming... I genuinely think it's psychologically impossible for a lot of people to notice and to think and to see.
[00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.329]  I do.
[00:50:22.589 --> 00:50:23.910]  And that's one of the great horrors.
[00:50:25.491 --> 00:50:27.593]  They've rendered us stupid.
[00:50:27.984 --> 00:50:38.669]  Well, most reporters get those calls that actually go to Bilderberg, so I'm just giving you a warning to let her know, since you're online, to just laugh it off when they call.
[00:50:38.709 --> 00:50:39.869]  Okay, so she's listening.
[00:50:40.149 --> 00:50:42.390]  Now, we appreciate your time.
[00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:46.592]  Do you have a website, books, writings, stuff you want to point people at?
[00:50:48.733 --> 00:50:51.894]  Apart from yours?
[00:50:54.068 --> 00:50:56.210]  No, do you know what?
[00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:58.292]  I might start writing some more things on this subject.
[00:50:58.352 --> 00:51:01.855]  This is the first time I've tackled this subject in any way.
[00:51:02.256 --> 00:51:08.702]  And, you know, certainly I didn't set out to Athens thinking I'd be detained twice by the police.
[00:51:09.082 --> 00:51:10.744]  So, you know, I might write some more.
[00:51:10.784 --> 00:51:11.985]  Then again, I don't want my dog threatened.
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.904]  So, you know, I might just go back to writing jokes about anyone.
[00:51:14.924 --> 00:51:16.646]  Well, no, they're not threatening the dog.
[00:51:16.867 --> 00:51:23.076]  They will tell you, oh, you're there, just made yourself, it looks like, is that coffee or tea you're making there?
[00:51:23.116 --> 00:51:23.497]  Hello?
[00:51:23.597 --> 00:51:23.997]  Excuse me?
[00:51:24.017 --> 00:51:26.621]  You've got the, and you're like, wondering how they're looking at you.
[00:51:26.641 --> 00:51:27.903]  And it's like, that's right.
[00:51:28.484 --> 00:51:30.945]  Bitch, I'm going to stab you and rape you to death.
[00:51:30.986 --> 00:51:31.626]  How's that sound?
[00:51:32.046 --> 00:51:37.309]  So I'm saying, and they'll say it just like that, so I'm just trying to give you an idea who these people are.
[00:51:37.409 --> 00:51:40.051]  I'm telling you, Mr. Skelton, I've been down the rabbit hole.
[00:51:40.091 --> 00:51:41.031]  You're starting to go down it.
[00:51:41.452 --> 00:51:45.494]  And you've opened up your first step into a wider world.
[00:51:45.854 --> 00:51:47.555]  And there's good things and there's bad things about it.
[00:51:47.995 --> 00:51:50.037]  But I'm just letting the listeners know, too.
[00:51:50.737 --> 00:51:53.078]  For folks, you ever wonder about the New World Order and who they are?
[00:51:53.378 --> 00:51:55.039]  These are murdering criminals.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:52:00.402]  And these are the bankers, we have this from inside Bilderberg, that are engineering the financial collapse.
[00:52:00.442 --> 00:52:02.323]  We said that three years ago today.
[00:52:03.444 --> 00:52:06.866]  We said they were going to engineer it, how they would do it, what they do with the stock market.
[00:52:07.226 --> 00:52:08.247]  We broke it all down.
[00:52:08.407 --> 00:52:09.667]  They rule the planet.
[00:52:10.568 --> 00:52:12.209]  And so we are here.
[00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:13.570]  This is happening.
[00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:15.891]  This is going on right now.
[00:52:16.751 --> 00:52:18.913]  And so I just
[00:52:19.813 --> 00:52:22.474]  I just want you to know that this is very, very serious.
[00:52:22.534 --> 00:52:24.815]  And the cop on the beat, he's just taking you to jail.
[00:52:24.855 --> 00:52:25.896]  He's probably not a bad guy.
[00:52:25.916 --> 00:52:26.696]  He's on a power trip.
[00:52:27.376 --> 00:52:29.277]  That cop is compartmentalized too.
[00:52:29.577 --> 00:52:30.898]  His family's being destroyed.
[00:52:30.998 --> 00:52:32.158]  His future's being destroyed.
[00:52:32.459 --> 00:52:36.340]  His world's being destroyed by the very bankers he's criminally protecting.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:41.903]  You know, he has to break a law and violate your free speech under the EU Charter and the laws of Greece.
[00:52:43.063 --> 00:52:45.404]  They break the law and keep taking you to jail.
[00:52:45.464 --> 00:52:46.825]  Beat the rap, can't beat the ride.
[00:52:47.265 --> 00:52:50.887]  So they're committing crimes to destroy their own futures.
[00:52:53.248 --> 00:52:54.668]  I've just thought of a book I'd like to recommend.
[00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:56.149]  What book is that?
[00:52:57.310 --> 00:52:58.190]  Well, it's a little bit odd.
[00:52:58.270 --> 00:53:06.454]  You might think me recommending it, but I picked up a copy of the diaries of Goebbels, the German propagandist from World War II.
[00:53:06.994 --> 00:53:09.615]  One of the most evil men of all time.
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:23.040]  But also one of those brilliant psychologists and these papers were rescued after the war and almost by chance and what's revealed in his diaries is just one of the early exponents of propaganda
[00:53:23.507 --> 00:53:31.132]  of mind manipulation, of the population control, giving and taking, guiding the public mind, and it's an extraordinary read.
[00:53:31.432 --> 00:53:37.536]  And I recommend everyone to just have a look at it, because you read it and you go, my God, this guy is, you know, he's one of the groundbreakers there.
[00:53:37.677 --> 00:53:39.278]  He's one of the groundbreakers.
[00:53:39.338 --> 00:53:41.679]  Well, you know who he cited?
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.261]  He cited Edward Bernays.
[00:53:45.802 --> 00:53:47.043]  I heard that today, actually, from him.
[00:53:47.895 --> 00:53:49.376]  Yes, you were reading them.
[00:53:49.777 --> 00:53:51.358]  I've actually read part of those.
[00:53:51.398 --> 00:53:53.540]  I didn't have time to read the whole book.
[00:53:53.801 --> 00:53:54.481]  Which book do you have?
[00:53:54.521 --> 00:53:58.345]  There's two books that I know of that have the writings of... Do you know what?
[00:53:58.405 --> 00:53:58.725]  I don't know.
[00:53:58.786 --> 00:54:00.507]  It's an old... It's an old Catholic book.
[00:54:00.527 --> 00:54:03.330]  Joseph Goimbel's The Nazi Propaganda Galleiter.
[00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:04.051]  Stay there.
[00:54:04.071 --> 00:54:05.232]  Let's do one more segment if you can do it.
[00:54:05.825 --> 00:54:10.927]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[00:54:11.207 --> 00:54:19.491]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[00:54:19.771 --> 00:54:23.072]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[00:54:23.352 --> 00:54:26.293]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[00:54:26.574 --> 00:54:28.714]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?
[00:54:29.075 --> 00:54:31.796]  Make the change to organic health and beauty products.

[00:55:06.221 --> 00:55:11.543]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:55:12.063 --> 00:55:19.046]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:25.783]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:55:26.203 --> 00:55:28.043]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:55:28.184 --> 00:55:30.604]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:55:30.685 --> 00:55:41.469]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:55:42.248 --> 00:55:43.529]  It's not about left or right.
[00:55:43.909 --> 00:55:45.329]  It's about a one world government.
[00:55:45.769 --> 00:55:52.092]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:56:00.955 --> 00:56:02.095]  The Obama Deception.
[00:56:02.515 --> 00:56:03.716]  The people strike back.
[00:56:05.783 --> 00:56:09.789]  Less than a century ago, half of the American public grew much of their own food.
[00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:14.174]  Today, it's been estimated that only 1% of Americans still grow their own food.
[00:56:14.455 --> 00:56:18.740]  During the Great Depression, over 18 million people suffered from starvation.
[00:56:18.941 --> 00:56:20.583]  And as America continues down its
[00:56:20.623 --> 00:56:21.563]  We're good to go.

[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:23.141]  Look, Charlie Skelton, you're a smart guy.
[00:57:23.161 --> 00:57:24.242]  Writer for The London Guardian.
[00:57:24.282 --> 00:57:26.304]  Writer for a lot of big publications.
[00:57:27.044 --> 00:57:28.305]  I'm not here preaching at you.
[00:57:28.585 --> 00:57:30.006]  I'm just telling you, I've been there.
[00:57:30.026 --> 00:57:30.647]  I've seen it.
[00:57:31.507 --> 00:57:34.129]  I can't believe how evil the globalist are, but they revel.
[00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:37.672]  They one-up each other on who is the most ruthless, who is the most corrupt.
[00:57:39.113 --> 00:57:42.055]  And Edward Bernays and Joseph Goebbels, that's 80-year-old stuff.
[00:57:43.216 --> 00:57:45.237]  You know, when they were really in their heydays.
[00:57:46.718 --> 00:57:49.941]  And it's all being used today, but even more sophisticated, they fuse
[00:57:51.047 --> 00:58:03.934]  More than a hundred different types of propaganda together, where I can't even articulate it, I can just behold it and go, when I'm watching television, I mean, that's how scientific it is, and the wordsmithing and the twisting and the tactics.
[00:58:05.041 --> 00:58:06.802]  And, uh, but you're talking about Goebbels.
[00:58:06.842 --> 00:58:07.703]  That is good to read.
[00:58:07.723 --> 00:58:09.965]  I definitely want to have you back up in the near future.
[00:58:09.985 --> 00:58:11.386]  I want to get you up for 15, 20 minutes tomorrow.
[00:58:11.406 --> 00:58:12.346]  I won't keep you for 10 hours.
[00:58:12.687 --> 00:58:13.867]  Your cell bill's huge.
[00:58:14.428 --> 00:58:15.729]  Uh, you know, it's 50 bucks or something.
[00:58:15.749 --> 00:58:16.249]  Send me a bill.
[00:58:16.269 --> 00:58:16.869]  I'll pay for it.
[00:58:16.889 --> 00:58:17.950]  So I appreciate you.
[00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:20.892]  We were going to try to call your hotel, but you, uh, got detained.
[00:58:20.912 --> 00:58:22.834]  And luckily we thought to get your cell phone earlier.
[00:58:22.854 --> 00:58:27.757]  Uh, and I know I've been, you know, preaching at you, but, but you're there, arrested twice, released again.
[00:58:28.317 --> 00:58:29.218]  Have they won?
[00:58:29.238 --> 00:58:31.260]  I mean, are you not going back now?
[00:58:32.921 --> 00:58:34.922]  You know, to the Bilderberg group meeting.
[00:58:35.423 --> 00:58:47.411]  I mean, I guess you could go buy a 100-pound, 200-pound digital Zoom, a little bit better Sony, one that has like a 50 zoom or something, and maybe have taxis drive by and take photos.
[00:58:47.852 --> 00:58:48.872]  Digitals are good at that.
[00:58:48.953 --> 00:58:51.935]  Don't let them stop you just because they've arrested you twice.
[00:58:51.995 --> 00:58:53.296]  Now, that's easy to say.
[00:58:53.956 --> 00:58:57.579]  I was only arrested once for 16 hours and didn't like it, or 15, 16, whatever.
[00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:00.221]  But, I mean, where are you going from here?
[00:59:01.027 --> 00:59:02.750]  It's a good question, have they won?
[00:59:03.732 --> 00:59:04.733]  Partially they have today.
[00:59:04.934 --> 00:59:09.462]  I was intimidated enough not to go up to the gates of the hotel today.
[00:59:09.482 --> 00:59:13.028]  I was well away from it when I was detained for the second time.
[00:59:13.815 --> 00:59:20.218]  Uh, because, and I was saying, you know, I was laughing through gritted teeth with the policewoman who was going, I can't believe you're back again.
[00:59:20.619 --> 00:59:22.559]  And I was saying, look, I was trying not to be.
[00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:25.381]  I was trying not to be detained.
[00:59:25.601 --> 00:59:28.122]  But see, I would have told her, it's your problem!
[00:59:28.743 --> 00:59:31.044]  What is this, Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia?
[00:59:32.702 --> 00:59:42.349]  I mean, folks, they're already censoring the internet, they're setting that up, the same way China phased it in, the free speech zones, that started in Russia, then China.
[00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:46.573]  Listen, if you study this, Mr. Skelton, you're there reading propaganda documents right now.
[00:59:47.253 --> 00:59:48.654]  They phased this stuff in.
[00:59:48.894 --> 00:59:51.376]  If you're reading Goebbels' diaries, you see he talks about that.
[00:59:53.238 --> 01:00:01.404]  Yeah, I mean, information is the key thing, the holding back or sharing of information.
[01:00:02.014 --> 01:00:11.999]  You know, insofar as the internet allows a sharing of viewpoints, of differing viewpoints and of information, different information, you know, the key word being different, you know, that's great.
[01:00:12.159 --> 01:00:14.620]  I don't know how long that difference is going to last.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:28.907]  And I'd like to make a serious point here, which is that, you know, it's very difficult to categorise the alternative media and people with alternative viewpoints as one thing, whereas Bilderberg, they're sitting there and they are strategising and they, you know,
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.781]  There is whatever you might think is happening.
[01:00:32.081 --> 01:00:40.585]  Whatever you characterize the Build-A-Bed meeting as, you have to agree that some strategizing, some ideas, some forward thinking is being done.
[01:00:40.625 --> 01:00:42.825]  I mean, whether you think it's benign, malign, whatever.
[01:00:43.226 --> 01:00:45.386]  So this kind of strategy... Oh no, power brokers!
[01:00:45.687 --> 01:00:46.487]  Yeah, I know, I know.
[01:00:46.687 --> 01:00:49.588]  They don't get together and talk about power.
[01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:52.149]  Sure, I know.
[01:00:52.449 --> 01:00:58.932]  But, you know, on the point of, you know, you turn it around and you see what people like you and other alternative voices are saying.
[01:00:59.605 --> 01:01:12.033]  It's very difficult to strategize against that kind of serious big money strategizing that's going on their side.
[01:01:12.053 --> 01:01:16.035]  One of the difficult things is that people have differences of opinion and people disagree.
[01:01:16.075 --> 01:01:19.798]  I disagree with my wife about aspects of September 11th, for example.
[01:01:19.818 --> 01:01:20.578]  I disagree about
[01:01:23.094 --> 01:01:24.075]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:01:55.545 --> 01:02:04.216]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:02:04.276 --> 01:02:08.402]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient.
[01:02:08.732 --> 01:02:08.832]  Yeah!
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:30.840]  We're good to go.
[01:02:58.579 --> 01:03:00.520]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:03.841]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:10.883]  Big Brother.
[01:03:11.524 --> 01:03:12.604]  Mainstream media.
[01:03:13.284 --> 01:03:14.405]  Government cover-ups.
[01:03:15.045 --> 01:03:15.865]  You want answers?
[01:03:16.625 --> 01:03:17.606]  Well, so does he.
[01:03:18.186 --> 01:03:21.887]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:03:22.367 --> 01:03:26.429]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:03:31.328 --> 01:03:36.611]  Charlie Skelton, who writes for one of the biggest newspapers in the world, is covering Bilderberg, The London Guardian.
[01:03:36.951 --> 01:03:45.136]  In five more minutes with him, the total phone blitz and news blitz coming up, and a guest about the government kidnapping children en masse.
[01:03:45.276 --> 01:03:57.363]  A state representative will be joining us, but I want to be clear and also let you know now what you've stepped into, Mr. Skelton, because we're not making this up.
[01:03:58.584 --> 01:04:00.525]  You'll probably be stuck on a no-fly list now.
[01:04:02.196 --> 01:04:03.757]  And this is how the globalists operate.
[01:04:04.377 --> 01:04:04.998]  It's unnamed.
[01:04:05.018 --> 01:04:07.540]  They won't tell you why you're on it for the rest of your life.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.362]  With Interpol, UK, US.
[01:04:12.163 --> 01:04:18.007]  You're on file for daring to work for a big newspaper and go cover world leaders meeting to set the future of the world.
[01:04:18.647 --> 01:04:20.228]  With all the big bank ministers in secret.
[01:04:20.688 --> 01:04:22.350]  With helicopters and guys with machine guns.
[01:04:22.810 --> 01:04:24.811]  Now think about how butt backwards that is.
[01:04:25.752 --> 01:04:30.195]  You know, here we are trying to cover this and they make it like we're the bad guys.
[01:04:31.991 --> 01:04:41.318]  You know, they make us go to the airports and thumb scan and face scan and take our shoes off and be body scanned and be searched and ask questions, but then they just fly in private jet, helicoptered in.
[01:04:41.338 --> 01:04:46.381]  The police and military we pay for, then protect them to carry out their crimes against our nation.
[01:04:46.401 --> 01:04:46.962]  And there's no doubt.
[01:04:47.002 --> 01:04:53.707]  I mean, one Bilderberg group member I know is under indictment and he's involved grabbing the Texas power plants and he's Pakistani.
[01:04:54.067 --> 01:04:56.669]  He's involved grabbing the roads and the NAFTA highways.
[01:04:56.709 --> 01:05:00.492]  I mean, these guys come in, buy off governments and have the governments hand them everything.
[01:05:01.371 --> 01:05:02.992]  Same thing the Nazis did that you were mentioning.
[01:05:03.712 --> 01:05:07.893]  So, that's how they operate and now they have these new hate lists.
[01:05:08.514 --> 01:05:12.715]  And now they want to put American gun owners on lists without ever saying why you can't own a gun.
[01:05:12.735 --> 01:05:17.357]  I mean, this is tyranny and we have to go ahead and just recognize it and deal with it.
[01:05:17.617 --> 01:05:23.779]  Any final comments on that and any other observations about where they're meeting, the security they've got at Bilderberg 2009 in Athens, Greece?
[01:05:27.812 --> 01:05:32.094]  Well, as for that, I might keep my distance a little bit more, even to tomorrow.
[01:05:32.454 --> 01:05:34.956]  Maybe it's one drop of it, so I'll stay a little bit clear.
[01:05:35.256 --> 01:05:36.136]  No, no, it's too late!
[01:05:36.236 --> 01:05:36.636]  Too late!
[01:05:36.656 --> 01:05:38.177]  They've already arrested you twice.
[01:05:38.717 --> 01:05:43.059]  That was just to bring you in and identify you and get you in the slave grid.
[01:05:43.119 --> 01:05:44.160]  Now you just gotta fight them.
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:45.581]  Go ahead.
[01:05:46.641 --> 01:05:56.786]  Well, you remind me, one last thing I would say, when you're talking, I thought about the writings, when they're written down, the writings of Bill Hicks.
[01:05:57.781 --> 01:06:07.327]  The late, great comedian, who in his stand-up routines was making some very, very serious points about exactly what you're talking about.
[01:06:07.667 --> 01:06:16.572]  And one of the things he said, for example, about the assassination of Kennedy, whatever you think about it, is he said, you know, he wants to talk about the assassination of Kennedy.
[01:06:17.252 --> 01:06:19.253]  Other people are saying, now, come on, that's past history.
[01:06:19.273 --> 01:06:20.194]  And he's going, come on, man.
[01:06:21.024 --> 01:06:22.245]  The president who was killed.
[01:06:22.465 --> 01:06:23.386]  Can we not talk about it?
[01:06:23.906 --> 01:06:24.667]  Same thing with 9-11.
[01:06:25.007 --> 01:06:31.192]  I talked to my brother about it and he goes, my brother goes, bless him, he goes, you know, that's eight years ago, you know, come on, we've moved on.
[01:06:31.232 --> 01:06:32.773]  And I'm going, no, hang on.
[01:06:33.274 --> 01:06:34.414]  There are questions to be asked.
[01:06:34.454 --> 01:06:35.195]  This is a big thing.
[01:06:35.235 --> 01:06:42.841]  So, you know, asking questions, I think that's the, it's such an important thing to ask questions, even if, you know, even if you find out it is.
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.442]  X, Y, and Z. Have you been told?
[01:06:45.542 --> 01:06:45.762]  Good!
[01:06:46.022 --> 01:06:49.385]  You know, I'd love to find out that things happened as I'm told.
[01:06:49.445 --> 01:06:54.129]  It would mean the people weren't lying to me.
[01:06:54.329 --> 01:07:01.195]  They also told us 9-11 was the foundation of the police state and giving up our rights and the world was different and we had to invade all these countries, so...
[01:07:02.316 --> 01:07:03.497]  They're always invoking 9-11.
[01:07:04.337 --> 01:07:11.762]  And then when we try to go, well, wait, governments have staged terror, and this looks like it's staged, oh, that's ridiculous, that's old news, don't discuss it, it's a dead issue.
[01:07:12.223 --> 01:07:17.346]  Again, they're trying to set the agenda, set the parameters of the debate, get outside the box.
[01:07:17.626 --> 01:07:20.328]  I got Tucker on at 8 o'clock your time tomorrow.
[01:07:20.448 --> 01:07:24.651]  It's 9-04, Greece time, where you're at, Mr. Skelton.
[01:07:24.951 --> 01:07:27.673]  What time can you come on the show?
[01:07:27.713 --> 01:07:30.215]  What time can you come on tomorrow for 10-15 minutes for an update?
[01:07:31.864 --> 01:07:32.885]  Uh, anytime at all.
[01:07:33.365 --> 01:07:34.025]  Uh, I'm free and easy.
[01:07:34.045 --> 01:07:36.186]  Well, I say free, but as long as I'm not under arrest.
[01:07:36.526 --> 01:07:37.147]  Anytime at all.
[01:07:37.447 --> 01:07:42.349]  Let's have you on at, uh... Let's have you on at 8.30 tomorrow.
[01:07:42.369 --> 01:07:43.710]  Okay.
[01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:47.232]  Would you like us to call your room, or would you like us to call your cell phone?
[01:07:49.172 --> 01:07:49.833]  Uh, I...
[01:07:50.478 --> 01:07:50.978]  Do you know?
[01:07:51.018 --> 01:07:51.659]  I don't know.
[01:07:51.699 --> 01:07:52.660]  Probably the cell phone status.
[01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:57.223]  Well, we're linking to your articles up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and The Guardian.
[01:07:57.884 --> 01:08:00.586]  And we're glad that you're joining the team.
[01:08:00.946 --> 01:08:02.387]  We really appreciate you, Mr. Skelton.
[01:08:02.407 --> 01:08:03.148]  You have a lot of courage.
[01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:10.594]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from the resistant new strains of deadly bacteria and viruses?
[01:08:11.127 --> 01:08:19.314]  Check out SupernaturalSilver.com today, or visit the link on InfoWars.com to find out more about this incredible new silver compound.
[01:08:19.414 --> 01:08:26.239]  The new silver solution is a natural antibiotic that is clinically tested to kill viruses, germs, bacteria, and yeast safely.
[01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:31.223]  This new silver solution liquid form was shown to be a powerful preventative
[01:08:31.499 --> 01:08:32.340]  We're good to go.
[01:08:53.519 --> 01:08:56.720]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:01.522]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:09:19.807 --> 01:09:26.031]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:09:26.331 --> 01:09:28.232]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:30.794]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:09:30.874 --> 01:09:41.821]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:09:42.461 --> 01:09:43.742]  It's not about left or right.
[01:09:44.122 --> 01:09:45.503]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:09:45.982 --> 01:09:52.309]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:09:52.889 --> 01:10:00.677]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:10:01.158 --> 01:10:02.299]  The Obama Deception.
[01:10:02.739 --> 01:10:03.921]  The people strike back.
[01:10:06.115 --> 01:10:09.497]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:10:09.637 --> 01:10:14.841]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:10:15.041 --> 01:10:19.804]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:10:20.004 --> 01:10:30.972]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:10:31.252 --> 01:10:36.818]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:10:36.998 --> 01:10:43.085]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:10:43.225 --> 01:10:43.866]  What about you?
[01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:50.153]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99, with free shipping.

[01:11:22.765 --> 01:11:25.169]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live!
[01:11:25.570 --> 01:11:32.884]  And I'm gonna go to your calls right now, and then coming up, scientists arrested for smuggling vials used in Ebola!
[01:11:33.845 --> 01:11:34.346]  Research.
[01:11:35.538 --> 01:11:36.498]  In the United States.
[01:11:37.499 --> 01:11:38.899]  That's out of the French News Agency.
[01:11:39.919 --> 01:11:41.860]  I mean, I see these stories every two or three days.
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:43.980]  The army caught sneaking around anthrax.
[01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:46.381]  Some other government group caught with foot and mouth weaponized.
[01:11:46.741 --> 01:11:51.062]  Some other government group or private company trying to mix bird flu with vaccines.
[01:11:51.622 --> 01:11:55.063]  Top scientists saying the virus is engineered that popped up three weeks ago.
[01:11:56.769 --> 01:12:08.414]  And they're building more of these labs everywhere, more plausible deniability as they release things to have scares, to push vaccines on us, and to get more control and federalization, but also to then release real attacks in the future.
[01:12:09.955 --> 01:12:12.516]  We'll continue to cover Bilderberg later in the next hour.
[01:12:12.636 --> 01:12:14.637]  I've got a huge stack of mainstream news.
[01:12:14.677 --> 01:12:15.497]  This is unprecedented.
[01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:16.278]  We're winning!
[01:12:17.230 --> 01:12:21.413]  The mainstream media has gone from saying none of this existed, there's no global government, to having to admit it all.
[01:12:21.693 --> 01:12:24.055]  And then now they still criticize us when we talk about it?
[01:12:24.336 --> 01:12:25.416]  They have no credibility!
[01:12:25.436 --> 01:12:26.657]  They're losing credibility!
[01:12:27.818 --> 01:12:31.421]  And so many people are compartmentalized inside mainstream media, they're not even really bad.
[01:12:31.761 --> 01:12:33.843]  They were ignorant, believing the official line.
[01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:35.084]  They're waking up.
[01:12:36.945 --> 01:12:37.786]  Very, very exciting.
[01:12:38.146 --> 01:12:40.048]  Okay, let's go to Jared in Texas.
[01:12:40.088 --> 01:12:41.409]  Jared, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:12:42.370 --> 01:12:42.870]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:12:43.130 --> 01:12:44.171]  It's awesome to be here.
[01:12:44.231 --> 01:12:45.172]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:12:46.774 --> 01:12:49.936]  Anyway, I wanted to talk about something that is a little bit exciting to me.
[01:12:49.996 --> 01:12:53.877]  I didn't know if you'd heard it, but do you know the history of Abraham Zapruder at all?
[01:12:56.378 --> 01:12:59.420]  He's got some spook background, right?
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:11.725]  Actually, I'm not that sure, but what I did want to point out, and I thought this was interesting, it was relevant in the sense that it's kind of a pattern the financiers go in and they like to control both sides.
[01:13:11.745 --> 01:13:13.846]  They like to be able to show the horror that they do.
[01:13:17.031 --> 01:13:19.412]  I have no doubt that the establishment was filming it.
[01:13:19.432 --> 01:13:29.837]  I don't know if they've released those photos, but some have speculated that Zubruder, you know, shot it and then TimeLive had it and it was allowed to be leaked through certain people who didn't even know it was being leaked through them.
[01:13:33.254 --> 01:13:39.281]  You know, but then people say, I was allowed to sneak into Bohemian Grove, and if I was, I was unknowing.
[01:13:40.222 --> 01:13:47.109]  Hold on just a minute, because I'm trying to explain this thought here, since you bring up this random pointer, but it's important.
[01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:51.914]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove because I read how others have been caught.
[01:13:52.825 --> 01:13:55.447]  And others, reporters always try to go in.
[01:13:56.328 --> 01:13:59.630]  Most of them get caught trying to get through the three guard fences.
[01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:04.814]  I went around them and got on a trolley from the parking lot that's only past one checkpoint.
[01:14:05.334 --> 01:14:10.037]  I went around one checkpoint, acted like I was normal, got on one of the flatback trucks.
[01:14:10.117 --> 01:14:10.878]  We videotaped it.
[01:14:10.898 --> 01:14:13.820]  It's in the film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:17.543]  It's comboed with The Order of Death, two films on one DVD, but side issue.
[01:14:18.797 --> 01:14:24.823]  I got in, drove through the other checkpoints, they looked at us, I smiled at them, was calm with Mike Hanson who was also calm, did a great job.
[01:14:25.684 --> 01:14:31.090]  We got in to the main facility and then I didn't run around trying to be social.
[01:14:31.751 --> 01:14:34.594]  These reporters, the last one for Vanity Fair that got arrested.
[01:14:35.523 --> 01:14:36.143]  He got arrested.
[01:14:36.544 --> 01:14:40.946]  His article's out, and he admits they were homosexual activity, and it was a bunch of... I mean, that's what goes on there.
[01:14:42.007 --> 01:14:43.508]  He admits that they're doing that.
[01:14:44.208 --> 01:14:46.690]  But the point is, he tried to go in and be social with these people.
[01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:48.551]  They walk up and say, who are you with?
[01:14:48.591 --> 01:14:49.151]  What are you doing?
[01:14:49.712 --> 01:14:50.912]  And I had Secret Service.
[01:14:51.152 --> 01:14:55.675]  I had Sheriff's County deputies that... By the way, the last guy that got arrested was Sheriff's County deputies.
[01:14:55.875 --> 01:14:57.736]  People are like, where's your footage of this, Alex?
[01:14:57.756 --> 01:14:59.077]  You have footage of everything but that.
[01:14:59.618 --> 01:15:01.399]  No, I've got a camera with a one-hour tape.
[01:15:02.179 --> 01:15:05.421]  I start taping, I pull up, I get in, I get in the truck, I go in.
[01:15:06.762 --> 01:15:11.085]  I've got a little button, because this is 2000, stuff wasn't hidden, you know, very good hidden camera.
[01:15:11.105 --> 01:15:14.248]  I got a little button I hit that supposedly starts the hidden camera.
[01:15:15.809 --> 01:15:22.633]  But, you know, I've got a bag here with the hidden pager on the front of it and I'm squeezing the button and it didn't tape.
[01:15:23.074 --> 01:15:25.275]  I mean, that's why, you know, the ritual's off at an angle.
[01:15:25.315 --> 01:15:27.317]  People are like, why isn't it high fidelity?
[01:15:27.337 --> 01:15:31.460]  You know, first they denied it was even real for years, but then now they admit it's real.
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:33.361]  And so I go through that as well.
[01:15:33.421 --> 01:15:37.484]  So just to say Abraham Subruder faked it is unfair.
[01:15:37.904 --> 01:15:45.030]  Because I don't believe in charging people with things with no evidence just because it could be a possibility and then it becomes a reality.
[01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:49.853]  Regardless, let's just, for the sake of argument, say I faked the Bohemian Grove.
[01:15:49.893 --> 01:15:52.035]  That is, they let me in, I shot the video.
[01:15:52.075 --> 01:15:52.916]  Now that's not true.
[01:15:53.336 --> 01:15:55.638]  But for mental illness sake, let's just say it is.
[01:15:56.278 --> 01:16:06.728]  Now, can we address world leaders having homosexual orgies and worshipping owl gods and running around the woods naked, admitting they do?
[01:16:06.748 --> 01:16:16.697]  I mean, can we address that instead of Alex Jones, you know, the one guy able to get in and get out with the goods?
[01:16:17.378 --> 01:16:19.219]  And you know, I give all the glory to God on that.
[01:16:19.239 --> 01:16:22.800]  You know, people just can't believe, you know, that Charlie Sheen calls me up and comes on.
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:25.541]  You know, Jesse Ventura we run into.
[01:16:26.461 --> 01:16:28.261]  Willie Nelson calls up and comes on.
[01:16:28.462 --> 01:16:31.703]  That I'm in a movie with Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder, and all these other...
[01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:34.790]  Woody Harrelson and all these other people.
[01:16:36.271 --> 01:16:38.992]  I mean, you know, people can't believe that.
[01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:47.514]  People couldn't believe when I shot Marines doing urban warfare takeovers, training, with role players screaming, I'm an American, please don't put me in the camp.
[01:16:47.855 --> 01:16:48.615]  It's all real!
[01:16:49.035 --> 01:16:51.376]  I just got on an airplane, flew there and shot it.
[01:16:51.776 --> 01:16:54.177]  You know, people don't believe that's a real police chief.
[01:16:54.257 --> 01:16:57.698]  I interviewed him in San Antonio, saying they tried to pay him off Delta Force.
[01:16:57.738 --> 01:16:59.538]  You could call, that was a real police chief.
[01:17:00.058 --> 01:17:01.759]  Ali Philippus, I was in his office.
[01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:06.181]  But they don't make a phone call to find out that's really Ali Philippus, they just say, not real.
[01:17:06.641 --> 01:17:09.242]  Now I'm not saying you're doing that, you just got me off on a rant there.
[01:17:09.602 --> 01:17:15.664]  This is mental illness, and what it is, is an excuse for the Patriot movement to not become leaders.
[01:17:16.104 --> 01:17:29.970]  Instead of them going out and fighting the Patriot Act and the New World Order and open borders and the globalists and the bankers are going to Bilderberg, or starting a blog or a radio show, most they sit back and talk crap about everybody else,
[01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:32.241]  That's been going on lately.
[01:17:33.622 --> 01:17:38.646]  They sit back doing that, and they sit back nitpicking and critiquing everyone who's in the arena.
[01:17:39.307 --> 01:17:41.148]  I need people to get in the arena.
[01:17:42.069 --> 01:17:42.469]  Okay?
[01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:44.651]  A lot of people are too far gone to ever get in the arena.
[01:17:45.732 --> 01:17:49.975]  They want success so bad, but they can't get in the arena to get the success.
[01:17:50.436 --> 01:17:52.457]  And then watch what you ask for, folks.
[01:17:53.578 --> 01:17:57.161]  Now, all of this is going on, and
[01:17:59.892 --> 01:18:00.753]  I've already digressed.
[01:18:00.773 --> 01:18:02.074]  What is the point of the phone call, sir?
[01:18:02.534 --> 01:18:05.156]  Let's just say Abraham Zavudar is absolutely evil.
[01:18:05.596 --> 01:18:06.197]  Let's just say it.
[01:18:06.477 --> 01:18:10.540]  But the point is, why did the military industrial complex kill Kennedy, is the question.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:10.880]  Go ahead.
[01:18:11.621 --> 01:18:14.183]  Okay, well, all I wanted to share with you was the detail.
[01:18:14.203 --> 01:18:16.565]  They made us watch a documentary in twelfth grade.
[01:18:16.585 --> 01:18:17.846]  This was about four years ago.
[01:18:18.306 --> 01:18:26.032]  And even my teacher at the time was questioning why they made us watch it, because it was graphic, it was digitally enhanced, it was Kennedy's, you know, it was his assassination, you know.
[01:18:26.593 --> 01:18:33.659]  And that there was a photo of Zapruder in that film, and it was interesting because, uh, you know, I believe the 9-11, that's glaring.
[01:18:33.799 --> 01:18:35.400]  You know, it's like, how can you not deny that?
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:39.663]  But, um, I mean, how could you deny it when it's so obvious?
[01:18:40.284 --> 01:18:44.087]  But, um, anyway, he was wearing, actually, in this picture, a Masonic lapel.
[01:18:44.767 --> 01:18:48.930]  You know, it had the cheat, had the compass, and the, uh, 90-degree ruler.
[01:18:49.511 --> 01:18:50.932]  And I thought that was really interesting.
[01:18:51.132 --> 01:18:52.673]  It actually really made my head pop.
[01:18:52.713 --> 01:18:54.675]  And the thing is, I searched for it on the Internet,
[01:18:55.123 --> 01:19:00.606]  And I'd only found a couple references to that, and I just wanted to know if you'd ever heard about such a thing.
[01:19:00.666 --> 01:19:01.486]  No, I hadn't.
[01:19:01.566 --> 01:19:02.947]  I can't remember the stuff.
[01:19:04.167 --> 01:19:06.388]  I've heard from credible people, but they're not sure.
[01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:09.290]  From Jim Mars and others about questions about Zubruder.
[01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:14.172]  Yeah, I just... But that's basically... I mean, it's questions.
[01:19:14.192 --> 01:19:15.053]  I appreciate your call.
[01:19:16.173 --> 01:19:18.794]  Let's go ahead and talk to... I'm sorry I went off on that tirade, folks.
[01:19:19.695 --> 01:19:21.696]  That's what happens when I'm at Information Overload Point.
[01:19:22.356 --> 01:19:23.376]  Sean in Minnesota.
[01:19:23.416 --> 01:19:24.177]  Sean, you're on the air.
[01:19:25.117 --> 01:19:26.599]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:27.460]  First time caller.
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:28.741]  Thanks for calling.
[01:19:29.462 --> 01:19:32.065]  Yep, well I'm here in Indianapolis, Indiana.
[01:19:32.105 --> 01:19:34.228]  Woke up this morning about 8.30, 9 o'clock.
[01:19:34.288 --> 01:19:38.773]  I walk outside and look to the sky and what do I see?
[01:19:38.793 --> 01:19:40.055]  A nice little spiderweb.
[01:19:41.266 --> 01:19:41.806]  Right in my day.
[01:19:41.846 --> 01:19:49.189]  And people always deny that there's chemtrails spraying, starting in the mid-nineties, but then now the government... Why would they do that?
[01:19:49.289 --> 01:20:00.573]  Now, just like they denied Bilderberg, and they denied CFR existed, and they denied New World Order, they denied the European Union even existed for decades before they openly set it up, and announced it, because it's a military tactic.
[01:20:00.753 --> 01:20:05.814]  Instead of ever debating, should they be terraforming and altering the atmosphere, they just say, nothing's going on.
[01:20:05.834 --> 01:20:09.776]  And now, though, they're going, yeah, we've been doing tests,
[01:20:10.396 --> 01:20:16.619]  To spray these particulates and give you a sunscreen to stop the dangerous sun rays from hurting you and the earth.
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:24.884]  And they give excuses in textbooks of, oh, we're spraying you to stop, you know, the ozone layer got holes in it and all of this happened.
[01:20:26.109 --> 01:20:38.616]  And so we've got to do this, and oh, we've got to cool the earth because of greenhouse gases, and the White House says we may have to start doing this, and then it's exactly what they announced, it's exactly what they've already been doing.
[01:20:39.117 --> 01:20:41.678]  So, you know, it's a huge subject.
[01:20:42.619 --> 01:20:43.559]  It is a huge subject.
[01:20:43.599 --> 01:20:55.506]  I've been following it now for the last couple of weeks because of you, and you know, you go on the web, you go on YouTube, and you find video after related video after related video, and I woke up, looked outside, because of the awareness now, I'm aware of it,
[01:20:56.061 --> 01:20:56.201]  Yeah.
[01:21:16.576 --> 01:21:17.556]  It's just, it's unbelievable.
[01:21:17.636 --> 01:21:18.377]  I mean, what do we do?
[01:21:18.417 --> 01:21:20.557]  I mean, how do we get more people aware?
[01:21:20.897 --> 01:21:22.258]  And why are they really doing this?
[01:21:22.318 --> 01:21:23.858]  I mean, don't they need a tax cut?
[01:21:23.878 --> 01:21:30.540]  Well, sir, what we know, and I appreciate your call, if you see my film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, it basically covers everything.
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.061]  It's kind of an encyclopedia.
[01:21:33.121 --> 01:21:41.523]  And in there we show, I think it's 20 different mainstream news articles, London Guardian, BBC, Associated Press, where they said, yeah, we took 4,300 U.S.
[01:21:42.283 --> 01:21:43.824]  foster children and radiated them to death.
[01:21:45.049 --> 01:21:49.411]  And yeah, we took 110,000 Jewish kids and radiated most of them to death, others we just cooked.
[01:21:50.391 --> 01:21:51.992]  And yeah, we took U.S.
[01:21:52.012 --> 01:21:54.253]  soldiers and put them in chambers and nerve gas them to death.
[01:21:54.873 --> 01:21:56.834]  And yeah, we sprayed every major U.S.
[01:21:56.854 --> 01:22:01.275]  city with unnamed bacteria and then had doctors in the hospitals to track how they died when they came in.
[01:22:02.396 --> 01:22:03.456]  And yeah, we did this.
[01:22:03.536 --> 01:22:04.477]  And yeah, we did that.
[01:22:05.157 --> 01:22:08.358]  So, they've already done it all these thousands of times, they admit.
[01:22:08.378 --> 01:22:10.079]  I mean, I took a small sampling in that film.
[01:22:12.034 --> 01:22:15.775]  And we go, okay, they've done all this over and over again, what could they be doing now?
[01:22:16.675 --> 01:22:18.816]  And then suddenly they're on Japanese and U.S.
[01:22:18.856 --> 01:22:25.237]  news going, maybe we should spray the people with kind of a Prozac-type chemical to make them calm.
[01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:34.520]  Maybe we should put statins so you don't have heart attacks, statin drugs, anti-cholesterol drugs in the water for children.
[01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:38.881]  Perhaps we should put lithium in all the water supply.
[01:22:40.259 --> 01:22:43.180]  So that, this was in the news last week, so that everybody will be happy.
[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:47.141]  So we know they're spraying and putting stuff in the water already.
[01:22:47.801 --> 01:22:50.641]  We know there's high-altitude atmosphere manipulation going on.
[01:22:50.921 --> 01:22:53.002]  We know there's low-level spraying going on.
[01:22:54.262 --> 01:23:00.283]  The real laboratory for this is some of the Pacific Islands.
[01:23:01.444 --> 01:23:02.384]  But, look,
[01:23:03.464 --> 01:23:04.605]  They're playing God, folks!
[01:23:04.705 --> 01:23:05.745]  We'll be right back.
[01:23:06.105 --> 01:23:09.367]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:23:09.547 --> 01:23:13.629]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:23:13.789 --> 01:23:25.234]  Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:23:25.454 --> 01:23:31.277]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:23:31.517 --> 01:23:32.157]  We're good to go.
[01:23:54.412 --> 01:23:54.793]  We're good.
[01:24:07.401 --> 01:24:09.363]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?

[01:24:44.088 --> 01:24:48.030]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:25:12.362 --> 01:25:17.707]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:25:18.227 --> 01:25:24.432]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:25:24.752 --> 01:25:26.554]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:25:26.714 --> 01:25:29.096]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:25:29.176 --> 01:25:40.065]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:25:42.353 --> 01:25:43.614]  It's not about left or right.
[01:25:44.014 --> 01:25:45.414]  It's about a one world government.
[01:25:45.874 --> 01:25:52.237]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:27:21.312 --> 01:27:27.153]  Scientists arrested for smuggling vials using Ebola research in the United States.
[01:27:29.914 --> 01:27:31.374]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[01:27:33.615 --> 01:27:34.495]  And a bunch of other news.
[01:27:34.515 --> 01:27:36.075]  Let's continue with your phone calls.
[01:27:36.815 --> 01:27:38.556]  Jill in Arizona.
[01:27:40.034 --> 01:27:40.875]  You're on the air.
[01:27:41.055 --> 01:27:41.895]  Welcome.
[01:27:42.376 --> 01:27:43.056]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:27:43.197 --> 01:27:47.019]  I'm a first-time caller, but I have two little things I want to address to you.
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:28:00.030]  One is, like, about, I think it was three weeks ago, you had a minister on who read you Romans 13 about everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities.
[01:28:01.411 --> 01:28:02.612]  You remember that minister?
[01:28:02.632 --> 01:28:09.297]  I think I was... I had a minister, a Baptist preacher, was beat up at an illegal checkpoint.
[01:28:09.773 --> 01:28:14.074]  Well, he was saying that he was getting letters sent to him by the government to preach Romans 13.
[01:28:14.134 --> 01:28:26.716]  Well, anyways, on that note, if you read that one, that's from the New International Version of the Bible, but if you read the King James Version, it doesn't say anything like that.
[01:28:27.216 --> 01:28:34.598]  So one was put out by the government, totally, and then the other one, the King James Version,
[01:28:36.009 --> 01:28:37.110]  Anyways, that was my point.
[01:28:37.190 --> 01:28:39.331]  And then the other question was... No, let me just back you up.
[01:28:39.371 --> 01:28:40.131]  Look, it's real simple.
[01:28:41.032 --> 01:28:46.294]  All of the major prophets were either killed or the government tried to kill them for not following the government's orders.
[01:28:46.454 --> 01:28:50.657]  Jesus was killed for not following the political and religious leaders' orders.
[01:28:51.017 --> 01:28:51.997]  Paul was killed.
[01:28:52.037 --> 01:28:52.878]  They were all killed!
[01:28:53.863 --> 01:29:06.307]  And so, and Jesus went in and beat the money changers, and it was all about standing up against evil, and Moses said no to Pharaoh, and by the sickening Romans 13 misinterpretation, that was Hitler's favorite quote.
[01:29:06.347 --> 01:29:13.510]  You read Goebbels' writings, he would laugh at Christians, how they would use that, and it was really Hitler started that, and then of course our government adopted it.
[01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:22.153]  The 68 Gun Control Act is word for word, because former Senator Dodd, not the current one, the old one's dead, he had been on the Nuremberg trial as a lawyer.
[01:29:23.266 --> 01:29:29.088]  And so he took it and changed the German to English, changed the name, and only a few lines are changed of the bill.
[01:29:29.468 --> 01:29:31.669]  We have the Nazi gun control law here in America.
[01:29:32.329 --> 01:29:32.969]  So they love it!
[01:29:32.989 --> 01:29:35.911]  I mean, the government hasn't found something the Nazis did they don't love.
[01:29:36.531 --> 01:29:40.632]  Black uniforms, homeland security, it was called Reich security, land security in Germany.
[01:29:41.993 --> 01:29:49.355]  It's all almost a carbon copy with a little bit of Soviet and East German and Chaikin mixed into the management system.
[01:29:49.395 --> 01:29:51.136]  Literally, they admit they've drawn from all of these
[01:29:52.648 --> 01:29:58.410]  And so Romans 13 is a complete, giant, stinking fraud, and that's why they teach it in the churches.
[01:29:58.450 --> 01:29:58.810]  Go ahead.
[01:29:59.430 --> 01:30:08.133]  Okay, and my second part to the question is, we've been talking to some people here in Arizona, and one of the ladies said, why would you want to fight it?
[01:30:08.313 --> 01:30:11.954]  Why not just stand down and let them go ahead and do their tyranny?
[01:30:12.494 --> 01:30:14.315]  Why not bring the second coming in?
[01:30:14.795 --> 01:30:22.337]  And I'm thinking, well, it's not really going to bring the second coming, because Christ is going to come whenever He wants to, not when they say, oh,
[01:30:22.970 --> 01:30:26.334]  We're going to bring tyranny to everybody so Christ will come.
[01:30:27.575 --> 01:30:35.104]  She basically told my husband and I that we were crazy and that we were lunatics and we should just stand down and not worry about it.
[01:30:36.721 --> 01:30:53.392]  Yeah, Christianity has turned from go out and say slavery is wrong and be killed for it, or, okay, take 1st century, 2nd century, 3rd century Christians in Rome killed by the hundreds of thousands over those several hundred years for not bowing down.
[01:30:53.472 --> 01:31:01.478]  Caesar said, you will bow to Jupiter, you will bow to Saturn, you will bow to Janus, you will bow, and they said no, and they said you die.
[01:31:01.498 --> 01:31:06.281]  Then according to the churches today, those Christians are going to hell.
[01:31:07.061 --> 01:31:09.422]  Because they should have hit their knees to Moloch.
[01:31:10.042 --> 01:31:24.668]  Now, it's asinine, but again, look, a cowardly, soft-handed, domesticated people that want to put on their little dresses and suits and go pimp around at church and the guys find boyfriends and the girls find boyfriends, you know, and that's what they do.
[01:31:24.688 --> 01:31:26.689]  You know, the churches are the main homosexual facilities.
[01:31:27.089 --> 01:31:30.911]  And they go there and that's where they find their, and that's their sexual preference.
[01:31:31.271 --> 01:31:36.093]  My point is the mainly Christian churches, the big ones, are for the men to have sex with men.
[01:31:36.793 --> 01:31:38.753]  And I'm not trying to shock people here on air.
[01:31:38.813 --> 01:31:39.994]  I mean, this is what I've discovered.
[01:31:40.474 --> 01:31:41.554]  I mean, take Bohemian Grove.
[01:31:41.594 --> 01:31:43.014]  Christian conservative leaders go there.
[01:31:43.034 --> 01:31:45.855]  It's a giant 15-day homosexual orgy.
[01:31:46.555 --> 01:31:48.595]  And I found the liberals like women.
[01:31:49.415 --> 01:31:54.856]  And I mean, you know, it's just, I guess, it sounds insane, ladies and gentlemen, but everything's insane.
[01:31:55.396 --> 01:31:56.016]  Anything else, ma'am?
[01:31:56.556 --> 01:32:04.138]  So my husband said, so you're going to teach your kids to stand down and let them rape and do whatever they want to your kids.
[01:32:04.178 --> 01:32:05.918]  You're going to let them do that to your kids.
[01:32:06.385 --> 01:32:08.467]  And right now she teaches them homeschool.
[01:32:08.947 --> 01:32:21.438]  So I said to her, well then if you say, stand down, then why don't you send your kids back to school so that they can, so that the government can take control of them and do whatever they want to them.
[01:32:21.969 --> 01:32:22.430]  I don't know.
[01:32:38.410 --> 01:32:42.611]  Well, she says I am actually thinking about sending my kids back to public school.
[01:32:42.831 --> 01:32:43.972]  Oh, it's of the Lord!
[01:32:44.652 --> 01:32:46.032]  Well, I mean, look, you can't help her.
[01:32:46.092 --> 01:32:47.613]  Move on, pearls before swine.
[01:32:48.253 --> 01:32:50.974]  That lady's gonna have a rude awakening when she enters hell, probably.
[01:32:51.974 --> 01:32:55.635]  But, uh... Yeah, no, California says it's illegal.
[01:32:56.255 --> 01:32:57.175]  We're on the march.
[01:32:57.655 --> 01:32:59.256]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:33:00.176 --> 01:33:02.897]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:05.535 --> 01:33:14.205]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:33:14.265 --> 01:33:18.410]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient.
[01:33:18.735 --> 01:33:18.835]  Yeah!
[01:33:40.037 --> 01:33:41.418]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:11.604]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:34:12.105 --> 01:34:19.117]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:34:19.671 --> 01:34:25.873]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:34:26.193 --> 01:34:28.093]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:34:28.233 --> 01:34:30.654]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:34:30.734 --> 01:34:41.677]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:34:42.297 --> 01:34:43.597]  It's not about left or right.
[01:34:43.978 --> 01:34:45.338]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:34:45.828 --> 01:34:52.195]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:35:05.839 --> 01:35:06.219]  We're good.
[01:35:19.002 --> 01:35:19.442]  I think so.

[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:58.920]  Look at this story from Curt Nemo.
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:00.741]  And it's in the New York Times as well.
[01:36:16.772 --> 01:36:21.698]  I don't, you know, I made 22 films and produced a couple more and I can't even remember anymore.
[01:36:22.959 --> 01:36:24.561]  Is it in Masters of Terror?
[01:36:25.697 --> 01:36:41.952]  Or is it in Road to Tyranny or Police State 3, where I show a clip off of ABC News where it goes, in Russia, the foster children, CPS from their parents, are trained at like age 5 to 18 to karate chop, to attack people, to enforce what the government wants.
[01:36:41.972 --> 01:36:43.574]  That's where they get their thug police.
[01:36:44.335 --> 01:36:47.538]  It's like Universal Soldier movie with Russell.
[01:36:48.567 --> 01:36:50.830]  Boy Scouts trained to become Homeland Gestapo.
[01:36:51.451 --> 01:36:58.880]  Now that's our article and you can see them there if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv all stacked up about the board of Homeland Security Bush.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:00.742]  And this is not new news to me.
[01:37:01.966 --> 01:37:08.530]  It's just that the first place I saw this was in 2002 in the Philadelphia Daily News.
[01:37:08.570 --> 01:37:21.638]  It was called Secure Corps, a division of AmeriCorps, and it described the middle school sixth and seventh graders training with, quote, M16s for gun confiscation, door-to-door search, fugitive apprehension,
[01:37:22.754 --> 01:37:38.827]  And it described them with dogs in the woods with the feds, and now hundreds of high schools are being converted and run by the Marine Corps and Army, where they go, oh, your school's now run by the Army, and they just show up in Virginia and Georgia and Illinois and California and everywhere, Texas, Michigan.
[01:37:39.808 --> 01:37:40.928]  I cover that every week now.
[01:37:41.549 --> 01:37:46.053]  And then they tell them, you'll be arrested if you don't sign up with the military, and then it's illegal.
[01:37:47.013 --> 01:37:49.034]  The Marines just go, we commit crime, we don't care.
[01:37:49.054 --> 01:37:51.895]  You know, they tell the kids, you'll go to jail if you don't sign up for this.
[01:37:51.955 --> 01:37:54.575]  And you're like, don't you be anti-Marine!
[01:37:54.615 --> 01:37:58.096]  It's good for them to threaten the children and run everything and run the schools.
[01:37:59.517 --> 01:38:02.738]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is directly out of the old Soviet Union.
[01:38:03.778 --> 01:38:09.360]  Ten minutes into errant mayhem in his town near the Mexico border,
[01:38:10.342 --> 01:38:15.266]  And the gunman, a disgruntled Iraq war veteran, see, they're training the kids to kill the vets!
[01:38:16.246 --> 01:38:18.268]  It just doesn't get any richer than this!
[01:38:18.908 --> 01:38:32.859]  I told you 12 years ago that they had government documents, and we got some of them here, and people didn't believe it, even when it had the FBI phone numbers on, you could call, saying veterans and gun owners and those that make frequent references to the Constitution were, quote, constitutional terrorists.
[01:38:32.899 --> 01:38:35.200]  In fact, Google constitutional terrorists.
[01:38:35.421 --> 01:38:37.602]  Let's put that on screen, the actual document from 99Forum.
[01:38:38.843 --> 01:38:40.645]  We got documents in 97 as well.
[01:38:42.066 --> 01:38:44.548]  So they're training to kill the vets.
[01:38:45.509 --> 01:38:47.111]  The vets will say, I'm patriotic!
[01:38:47.411 --> 01:38:49.753]  Romans 13 trained my kids to kill me!
[01:38:50.274 --> 01:38:52.996]  I don't care if Hitler and Stalin did it, it's freedom, baby!
[01:38:55.018 --> 01:39:00.844]  Man, and they're taking over the Boy Scouts, they're militarizing the fire departments to have them tattle and spy on citizens.
[01:39:01.384 --> 01:39:02.846]  They're federalizing everything, folks.
[01:39:04.076 --> 01:39:12.383]  Ten minutes into the errant mayhem in his town near the Mexico border, and the gunman, a disgruntled Iraq war veteran, has taken out two people.
[01:39:12.744 --> 01:39:15.326]  One slumped in a desk on the floor, covered in blood.
[01:39:17.142 --> 01:39:26.484]  The responding officers, eight teenage boys and girls, the youngest 14, face tripwire, a thin cloud of poisonous gas, and loud shots.
[01:39:26.624 --> 01:39:27.025]  Bam!
[01:39:27.085 --> 01:39:27.425]  Bam!
[01:39:27.745 --> 01:39:29.185]  Fire from behind a flimsy wall.
[01:39:29.205 --> 01:39:29.865]  They move quickly.
[01:39:30.545 --> 01:39:32.326]  Pellet guns drawn and masks affixed.
[01:39:32.586 --> 01:39:33.686]  See, they know the kids love this.
[01:39:33.706 --> 01:39:39.488]  They tell the kids, we're going to arrest you for BB guns, and they're always arresting kids playing paint gun in the, you know, city park.
[01:39:40.288 --> 01:39:44.529]  But you can come join the police and Homeland Security and have weapons, young man.
[01:39:44.989 --> 01:39:46.430]  Now tell us about your folks.
[01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:47.550]  You think I'm joking there?
[01:39:47.610 --> 01:39:49.030]  No, I have all the mainstream news articles.
[01:39:49.551 --> 01:39:53.012]  That's in Road to Tyranny, local newscast where they tell kids, tattle on their parents, you get $200.
[01:39:53.592 --> 01:39:55.572]  I mean, I made that seven years ago.
[01:39:55.672 --> 01:39:57.293]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:39:57.553 --> 01:39:58.213]  This is happening.
[01:39:59.209 --> 01:40:08.034]  So continuing here, the responding officers, eight teenage boys and girls, the youngest, 14, face tripwire, a thin cloud of poisonous gas, and loud shouts.
[01:40:08.114 --> 01:40:08.634]  Bam, bam!
[01:40:08.954 --> 01:40:10.295]  Fired from behind a flimsy wall.
[01:40:10.335 --> 01:40:13.116]  They move quickly, pellet guns drawn and mask affixed.
[01:40:13.557 --> 01:40:19.920]  United States Border Patrol, put your hands up, screams one voice, cracking with adolescent determination as the suspect is subdued.
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:21.060]  Now let me stop you right there.
[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:23.622]  I've noticed with the Homeland Security TV show,
[01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:29.982]  About six months ago, a caller called before it was even on air and said, there's a new Homeland Security show.
[01:40:30.022 --> 01:40:32.703]  And I remember going, hold on.
[01:40:34.004 --> 01:40:35.585]  It'll be set on the border.
[01:40:36.405 --> 01:40:38.206]  And the caller said, yeah, I just saw the ad.
[01:40:38.226 --> 01:40:38.886]  How did you know that?
[01:40:38.906 --> 01:40:40.347]  And I said, I know the enemy.
[01:40:40.987 --> 01:40:42.728]  And my point is, I'm not here tooting my horn.
[01:40:42.748 --> 01:40:44.969]  I'm trying to explain to you, I know their program.
[01:40:45.309 --> 01:40:46.150]  What is popular?
[01:40:47.754 --> 01:40:55.461]  Ninety-one percent in every Gallup poll they've had or higher of Americans, all Americans, you know, of a cross-section of black, Hispanic, white, ninety-one percent.
[01:40:55.882 --> 01:40:58.144]  It's seventy-plus percent of you just poll Hispanics.
[01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:04.524]  So they're against open borders as well, want the border militarized, which is constitutional.
[01:41:04.665 --> 01:41:09.789]  So that TV show to popularize homeland security is going to show you something popular.
[01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:19.397]  Not homeland security trying to take your guns, not homeland security spying on you without warrants, not homeland security training and building up to go after veterans and gun owners and conservatives.
[01:41:19.778 --> 01:41:24.042]  They're going to say homeland security is for foreign terrorists and it's for illegal aliens.
[01:41:25.051 --> 01:41:27.693]  And the parents of these kids are just pleased as punch, man.
[01:41:28.233 --> 01:41:31.115]  You're gonna go fight illegal aliens that are killing people.
[01:41:31.375 --> 01:41:32.075]  No, you're not!
[01:41:34.176 --> 01:41:37.318]  Now, see, they're playing the part of Border Patrol here.
[01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:45.483]  But when you read their training to have the Border Patrol fight American citizens.
[01:41:47.384 --> 01:41:48.965]  A disgruntled U.S.
[01:41:49.005 --> 01:41:49.405]  veteran.
[01:41:50.626 --> 01:41:52.647]  Now, they have these training drills all over the country.
[01:41:53.988 --> 01:41:58.410]  We pulled up on screen and covered the really famous ones in Michigan a few years ago.
[01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:59.270]  AP reported it.
[01:41:59.931 --> 01:42:03.932]  We covered it just a few weeks ago again, where they came in the school and said, we're going to kill all of you.
[01:42:03.972 --> 01:42:06.173]  We're homeschoolers against public school.
[01:42:06.573 --> 01:42:08.014]  And then said, I'm pro-Second Amendment.
[01:42:08.034 --> 01:42:10.555]  I'm going to kill you to terrorize the kids and make them hate the Second Amendment.
[01:42:10.875 --> 01:42:15.397]  And then when the local sheriff got in trouble, he said, well, the feds gave us the script and the grant.
[01:42:15.437 --> 01:42:16.618]  We're just doing what they told us.
[01:42:17.758 --> 01:42:19.779]  So you see, that's how they roll.
[01:42:21.294 --> 01:42:23.615]  Yeah, here's the Constitutional Terrorist thing.
[01:42:23.655 --> 01:42:24.676]  It says, Defenders of the U.S.
[01:42:24.716 --> 01:42:28.418]  Constitution against Federal Government and U.N.
[01:42:28.538 --> 01:42:29.298]  Super Patriots.
[01:42:29.338 --> 01:42:29.779]  Terrorist.
[01:42:30.639 --> 01:42:32.300]  It says, Make numerous references to the U.S.
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:32.980]  Constitution.
[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:35.101]  Claim driving as a right, not a privilege.
[01:42:35.202 --> 01:42:36.562]  Attempt to police the police.
[01:42:36.842 --> 01:42:38.183]  How dare citizens be involved in that?
[01:42:38.203 --> 01:42:43.826]  And it goes on to say, you know, just unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:45.827 --> 01:42:47.448]  It talks about Second Amendment groups.
[01:42:47.488 --> 01:42:49.809]  So you can go read that for yourself.
[01:42:51.889 --> 01:42:53.169]  Number one threat's the veterans.
[01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:59.471]  They're training your children, the Eagle Scouts now, on their little power trips.
[01:43:03.091 --> 01:43:03.651]  Look at these guys.
[01:43:03.671 --> 01:43:06.012]  Some of these guys are supposedly 16, and look, they're 2.
[01:43:07.592 --> 01:43:10.333]  I mean, I gotta say, these 14, 15, 16 year olds, they just really look...
[01:43:16.684 --> 01:43:22.311]  Well, I'll tell you what, when I was 14, I took over one of them all, and I'll tell you right now, these guys look like a bunch of wimps.
[01:43:22.371 --> 01:43:23.812]  I'm sorry, I just can't help it anymore.
[01:43:24.773 --> 01:43:26.956]  They're probably nice kids, and their parents are just idiots.
[01:43:27.036 --> 01:43:27.697]  Florida heads.
[01:43:27.717 --> 01:43:32.062]  I guarantee you, every one of these kids' parents loves Jack Bauer and fantasizes watching 24.
[01:43:33.976 --> 01:43:38.499]  And these kids are going to be men in just a year or two, and you know who they're going to go after?
[01:43:39.279 --> 01:43:40.420]  You're a veteran with guns?
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:42.261]  You want to know who's coming through your door?
[01:43:42.281 --> 01:43:44.282]  It's going to be guys being trained by these programs.
[01:43:45.063 --> 01:43:47.024]  Show, ladies and gentlemen, the training photos.
[01:43:47.064 --> 01:43:47.744]  Go back to them.
[01:43:48.105 --> 01:43:49.205]  This is children.
[01:43:51.487 --> 01:43:58.151]  This is children training to kill U.S.
[01:43:58.191 --> 01:43:58.611]  veterans.
[01:44:01.022 --> 01:44:05.364]  And again, Curt Nemo, Paul Watson have probably posted 50, 60 articles this bad today.
[01:44:05.704 --> 01:44:06.884]  I can't even read them all anymore.
[01:44:07.525 --> 01:44:08.345]  I haven't even covered it.
[01:44:08.365 --> 01:44:09.385]  It's totally overwhelming.
[01:44:09.465 --> 01:44:10.546]  We got Ebola missing.
[01:44:10.886 --> 01:44:11.646]  Total insanity.
[01:44:11.686 --> 01:44:13.887]  I told you the last virus was engineered in a lab.
[01:44:13.927 --> 01:44:14.627]  It's now admitted.
[01:44:15.128 --> 01:44:18.429]  They're saying it's going to mutate and kill everybody in the fall just like I told you they would.
[01:44:18.549 --> 01:44:19.429]  I know these people.
[01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:21.750]  I know these people.
[01:44:24.371 --> 01:44:24.991]  It goes on.
[01:44:25.051 --> 01:44:26.032]  United States Border Patrol.
[01:44:26.052 --> 01:44:27.112]  I'm going to read this again.
[01:44:27.733 --> 01:44:28.613]  Ten minutes into the
[01:44:31.132 --> 01:44:34.996]  Errant mayhem in the town near the Mexico border.
[01:44:37.158 --> 01:44:40.622]  And the gunman, a disgruntled Iraq war veteran, has already taken out two people.
[01:44:40.662 --> 01:44:43.004]  So they're practicing to take out themselves.
[01:44:43.024 --> 01:44:50.151]  You know, when they're done being paramilitary forces and they finally rebel later, when they get old enough, they'll have the new young'uns to kill them.
[01:44:50.411 --> 01:44:52.874]  That's how it worked in Germany, Russia, China.
[01:44:54.141 --> 01:44:57.204]  Because, I mean, let's face it, when you're 18, you're dumber than dirt.
[01:44:57.364 --> 01:44:59.646]  I certainly was, and I was smarter than most people who were 18.
[01:45:00.107 --> 01:45:01.248]  I learn more and more every day.
[01:45:01.268 --> 01:45:02.609]  I get more and more wisdom and knowledge.
[01:45:03.170 --> 01:45:05.652]  I can't imagine how much knowledge I'll have if I live another 20 years.
[01:45:06.213 --> 01:45:07.994]  I mean, right now, I'm not even saying I'm that smart.
[01:45:08.034 --> 01:45:10.797]  My brain burns with connections and understanding and research.
[01:45:11.218 --> 01:45:14.441]  And I look back at myself 10 years ago, I mean, I was a blithering idiot.
[01:45:15.081 --> 01:45:16.202]  What will I be like in 10 years?
[01:45:16.483 --> 01:45:17.564]  These kids don't know.
[01:45:17.604 --> 01:45:18.785]  These are nice kids, I'm sure.
[01:45:26.235 --> 01:45:28.616]  Oh man, the girl is just unbelievable in the middle.
[01:45:29.257 --> 01:45:30.617]  I mean, look at her, man.
[01:45:31.258 --> 01:45:34.860]  When your family's pulled over at a checkpoint and they're walking around with the German Shepherds.
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:35.680]  Let me tell you something.
[01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:37.881]  You go to a demonstration now and they've got German Shepherds?
[01:45:39.422 --> 01:45:41.243]  I mean, the government is rogue, folks.
[01:45:41.743 --> 01:45:43.144]  And I've had enough of it, I tell you.
[01:45:43.945 --> 01:45:46.026]  This government sure wants a fight, I tell you.
[01:45:46.066 --> 01:45:47.827]  They sure want one, don't they?
[01:45:47.847 --> 01:45:51.089]  And I tell you it's going to be 1776.
[01:45:51.269 --> 01:45:55.391]  If it does go to physical blows, all these people all day want to sit around and
[01:45:56.772 --> 01:45:59.673]  Talk about how the government's going to whoop our butt because they got all this technology.
[01:46:00.033 --> 01:46:00.733]  Baloney!
[01:46:02.594 --> 01:46:07.416]  No one can stop a guerrilla, decentralized, lone wolf army.
[01:46:09.077 --> 01:46:10.857]  There's over 100 million gun owners in this country.
[01:46:16.159 --> 01:46:19.020]  And I don't want it to come to that, but it looks like they're not going to give us a choice.
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:25.943]  So let's hold out as long as we can peacefully, but you can't put up with them trying to take your guns and take you to FEMA camps, you know.
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:30.081]  And I know this is going on.
[01:46:30.141 --> 01:46:44.151]  I keep telling listeners they've got giant cadres of youth, now for at least seven years I know of, who are now I guess if you were fourteen then, and now at seven years later you'd be twenty-one, twenty-two.
[01:46:46.873 --> 01:46:48.414]  And that's why these are the guys.
[01:46:48.474 --> 01:46:51.477]  These are the guys that arrest you when you try to go photograph the Bilderberg Group.
[01:46:51.817 --> 01:46:53.738]  These are the guys that tell you you don't have free speech.
[01:46:53.778 --> 01:46:54.319]  These are the guys.
[01:46:54.639 --> 01:46:55.720]  Now these young kids,
[01:46:56.897 --> 01:46:58.258]  I want to try to get some of their parents on.
[01:46:58.358 --> 01:47:00.118]  I mean, I'm sure they're nice people and mean well.
[01:47:00.478 --> 01:47:01.919]  Road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[01:47:02.399 --> 01:47:05.800]  It's all quite a step forward from the square knot.
[01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:06.580]  That's right.
[01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:14.183]  No longer how to build a fire, or how to survive in the wilderness, or how to learn morals, or the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:47:14.203 --> 01:47:16.124]  By the way, they don't teach that in Boy Scouts anymore.
[01:47:16.464 --> 01:47:19.825]  I went and looked at what they teach them now, and I said, I'm sorry, I guess my son can't be in that.
[01:47:20.285 --> 01:47:22.226]  It's basically like a communist organization now.
[01:47:22.906 --> 01:47:24.107]  The Explorers program,
[01:47:25.615 --> 01:47:26.616]  Co-educational.
[01:47:27.796 --> 01:47:29.197]  Co-educational affiliate.
[01:47:29.657 --> 01:47:31.278]  Yeah, can't have the Boy Scouts just be boys.
[01:47:32.019 --> 01:47:33.119]  See, it's totally different.
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:37.322]  A lot of these Boy Scout things are just basically places for your children to be molested.
[01:47:37.342 --> 01:47:41.344]  I mean, I'm sorry to have to report that to you, but that's basically what it's turned into.
[01:47:41.564 --> 01:47:42.064]  I'm sorry!
[01:47:42.104 --> 01:47:45.206]  We don't get the Boy Scouts back till we take it back over!
[01:47:47.588 --> 01:47:55.212]  Boy Scouts of America that began 60 years ago was training thousands of young people in skills used to confront terrorism, illegal immigration, and escalating border violence.
[01:47:56.644 --> 01:47:57.765]  No, that's not.
[01:47:57.805 --> 01:47:59.285]  They're training them to kill U.S.
[01:47:59.325 --> 01:47:59.745]  vets.
[01:47:59.785 --> 01:48:01.006]  They admitted it in the first line.
[01:48:02.687 --> 01:48:08.869]  An intense ratcheting up of one of the group's long-time missions to prepare youth for traditional jobs as police officers and firefighters.
[01:48:09.310 --> 01:48:10.410]  And that is why they started it.
[01:48:12.211 --> 01:48:14.472]  They started the NRA because the North couldn't shoot.
[01:48:15.112 --> 01:48:16.573]  Not bashing people up north.
[01:48:16.593 --> 01:48:18.994]  They'd become, you know, city dwellers.
[01:48:20.423 --> 01:48:22.184]  Everybody from the South had come from the North.
[01:48:22.944 --> 01:48:25.785]  And so, you know, the North had three times the troops.
[01:48:25.845 --> 01:48:27.845]  It could barely beat the South in four years.
[01:48:28.205 --> 01:48:29.666]  And so they had a public proclamation.
[01:48:29.706 --> 01:48:33.607]  The federal government funded the NRA to train school kids how to shoot.
[01:48:34.987 --> 01:48:41.389]  And they also set up the Boy Scouts to, you know, prepare them for how to carry a pack, how to follow discipline, how to follow orders.
[01:48:43.171 --> 01:48:47.236]  That's a far human cry, though, from training them to kill veterans.
[01:48:47.817 --> 01:48:48.858]  That isn't patriotic.
[01:48:49.158 --> 01:48:51.521]  Training them to kill vets isn't patriotic.
[01:48:51.721 --> 01:48:52.382]  Let me say it again.
[01:48:53.003 --> 01:48:55.206]  You starting to see how the Homeland Security documents
[01:48:56.164 --> 01:48:57.345]  About vets and gun owners.
[01:48:57.405 --> 01:48:58.726]  The Boy Scouts is about that.
[01:48:58.926 --> 01:48:59.987]  Everything is about that.
[01:49:00.207 --> 01:49:03.610]  And they got a bill introduced where if they say you're an extremist, you don't get to own a gun.
[01:49:03.670 --> 01:49:05.071]  No judge, no jury, no appeal.
[01:49:05.791 --> 01:49:08.453]  Somebody on death row gets appeals, but you as a gun owner don't.
[01:49:09.074 --> 01:49:13.177]  But you were like, oh, that's good for them al Qaeda to take all their rights away!
[01:49:13.537 --> 01:49:15.279]  But then now you're learning it's for you!
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:18.501]  Confronting terrorism is about killing the vets.
[01:49:19.522 --> 01:49:21.483]  And I'm not just saying that.
[01:49:22.845 --> 01:49:25.807]  This is how they take over in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.
[01:49:27.588 --> 01:49:30.051]  Who was the first group Hitler culled when he got to power?
[01:49:30.111 --> 01:49:31.212]  The police and military.
[01:49:31.733 --> 01:49:33.695]  He killed hundreds of thousands in that first year.
[01:49:33.835 --> 01:49:34.977]  Get ready, cops!
[01:49:35.517 --> 01:49:36.679]  Get ready, military!
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:39.242]  Get ready, business owners!
[01:49:40.796 --> 01:49:44.557]  This is about being a true-blooded American guy and girl, said A.J.
[01:49:44.997 --> 01:49:54.019]  Lowenthal, a sheriff's deputy here in Emerald, Imperial County, whose life clock, he says, is set around the Explorers events he helps run.
[01:49:54.679 --> 01:49:57.340]  It fits right in with the honor and bravery of the Boy Scouts.
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:49:59.580]  And again, it's Homeland Security funding this!
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:01.100]  This isn't the local sheriff!
[01:50:02.381 --> 01:50:05.781]  In fact, my dad sent this to me two weeks ago, and I keep meaning to print it.
[01:50:05.801 --> 01:50:07.042]  Will you go look in Aaron Dyke's printer?
[01:50:07.922 --> 01:50:08.582]  Is Aaron here yet?
[01:50:09.844 --> 01:50:14.889]  I want that email my dad sent me, and it describes life in 56 compared to life today.
[01:50:14.909 --> 01:50:18.312]  I don't know if we posted that, but will you just bring it to me?
[01:50:18.332 --> 01:50:22.516]  I said I'd take your calls, but how do I even do it?
[01:50:22.616 --> 01:50:23.277]  I don't even want to do this.
[01:50:23.737 --> 01:50:30.724]  I want to fight them, but I mean, I want to expose the globalists, but I just can't believe how hardcore the tyranny is.
[01:50:34.253 --> 01:50:35.854]  You've got to get the exact headline to find it.
[01:50:36.334 --> 01:50:36.914]  It's an email.
[01:50:38.054 --> 01:50:41.835]  It's life in 1956 school compared to 2008.
[01:50:45.036 --> 01:50:45.516]  You've seen it?
[01:50:46.797 --> 01:50:51.598]  Well, yeah, and literally when my dad was going to school in the mid-1960s, you know, he was in college in 67, 68, 69, 70.
[01:50:55.791 --> 01:51:05.197]  He would literally take a shotgun to school and ride on the school bus with it and then go shooting after school with the football coaches and his history teacher.
[01:51:07.978 --> 01:51:09.719]  Of course, back then you didn't have mass shootings.
[01:51:10.219 --> 01:51:14.081]  You had mass shootings because we're a mentally ill, degenerate, Prozac society.
[01:51:14.401 --> 01:51:19.124]  By the way, they tested the blood of that chimpanzee that murdered that lady and attacked the police.
[01:51:19.344 --> 01:51:21.786]  He was on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[01:51:22.306 --> 01:51:23.306]  He was on Xanax.
[01:51:23.827 --> 01:51:26.828]  And I told you that monkey was going to be... No, it's not a monkey, it's an ape.
[01:51:27.289 --> 01:51:29.250]  I told you that primate was going to be on it.
[01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:33.412]  Because apes rarely do that unless they're hopped up on drugs.
[01:51:36.704 --> 01:51:37.984]  Chimpanzees killing people.
[01:51:38.104 --> 01:51:38.665]  Prozac.
[01:51:38.745 --> 01:51:39.805]  People killing their parents.
[01:51:39.865 --> 01:51:40.425]  Prozac.
[01:51:41.505 --> 01:51:42.886]  And it's now on the drug insert.
[01:51:45.186 --> 01:51:46.207]  Oh, it doesn't even matter.
[01:51:49.448 --> 01:51:50.468]  And it just goes on.
[01:51:50.728 --> 01:51:53.489]  It says, uh, Kathy Norigo
[01:51:54.804 --> 01:51:56.807]  Sixteen said she was attracted by the guns.
[01:51:56.947 --> 01:51:58.649]  See, it's a message.
[01:51:58.669 --> 01:52:01.173]  You can't have guns in a society that are bad unless you're with the government.
[01:52:01.493 --> 01:52:07.661]  Oh God, you get to use them on little old ladies and get to gun people down in the back every day and we'll cover up for you.
[01:52:08.583 --> 01:52:09.364]  Oh, it's so good.
[01:52:19.441 --> 01:52:29.135]  Oh, they also have them take online, uh, they also have them take sensitivity training, and so they also indoctrinate them in an ADL script.
[01:52:29.155 --> 01:52:31.759]  I know, it's just unbelievable brainwashing.
[01:52:33.462 --> 01:52:35.485]  Oh my God, I can't handle it anymore.
[01:52:37.694 --> 01:52:48.941]  If there are critics of the content or purpose of law enforcement training, they have not made themselves known to the Explorers National Organization in Irving, Texas, or to the volunteers here on the ground, national officials and local leaders said.
[01:52:49.322 --> 01:52:51.643]  They said the Explorers have faced problems over the years.
[01:52:51.983 --> 01:52:59.668]  There have been numerous cases over the last decades in which police officers supervising Explorers have been charged in civil and criminal cases with sexually abusing them.
[01:52:59.948 --> 01:53:00.649]  Well, I told you!
[01:53:01.329 --> 01:53:05.312]  You give your kids to the Boy Scouts or public school, it's a rape room, basically.
[01:53:05.672 --> 01:53:06.312]  I just said that.
[01:53:06.372 --> 01:53:09.114]  I hadn't even read the article yet and I told you it'd be in there.
[01:53:11.595 --> 01:53:13.735]  And the Boy Scouts used to be the best thing out there.
[01:53:13.755 --> 01:53:16.837]  But this is, look, this country's full of evil people now.
[01:53:16.877 --> 01:53:17.637]  We became evil.
[01:53:18.518 --> 01:53:19.758]  This country's falling apart.
[01:53:20.278 --> 01:53:23.920]  And you put your children in public school, you put them in some kind of cop program.
[01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:26.381]  Have you read criminology?
[01:53:26.461 --> 01:53:28.342]  You know where real child offenders go?
[01:53:28.382 --> 01:53:29.682]  They want to be truancy officers.
[01:53:29.882 --> 01:53:31.163]  They want to be CPS people.
[01:53:34.249 --> 01:53:37.311]  I'm not saying all the CPS people are cops or pedophiles.
[01:53:38.152 --> 01:53:40.534]  I'm saying that's where you find the biggest percentage of them.
[01:53:41.715 --> 01:53:43.016]  I don't even feel like doing the show anymore.
[01:53:43.036 --> 01:53:44.057]  It makes me so sick!
[01:53:47.082 --> 01:53:48.363]  I just want to beat these tyrants.
[01:53:48.403 --> 01:53:49.424]  I just want to defeat them.
[01:53:49.904 --> 01:53:51.285]  I'm tired of the New World Order.
[01:53:51.305 --> 01:53:53.266]  I'm tired of the degenerate scum.
[01:53:53.827 --> 01:53:55.568]  I'm tired of all the corruption.
[01:53:55.948 --> 01:53:57.349]  I'm tired of evil.
[01:53:58.030 --> 01:53:59.070]  I'm tired of it!
[01:53:59.511 --> 01:54:03.814]  It's time for good people to start whooping some New World Order butt in the Info War!
[01:54:04.174 --> 01:54:06.716]  And if they want to start a physical fight, then to kick their butts!
[01:54:07.469 --> 01:54:08.249]  Spring is here.
[01:54:08.509 --> 01:54:09.289]  Growing season.
[01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:11.450]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:54:11.650 --> 01:54:13.071]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:54:13.371 --> 01:54:14.031]  Think about it.
[01:54:14.351 --> 01:54:18.192]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:54:18.432 --> 01:54:21.913]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:54:22.113 --> 01:54:24.694]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:54:24.954 --> 01:54:36.817]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[01:54:37.137 --> 01:54:37.457]  We're good.
[01:55:05.848 --> 01:55:07.189]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:55:07.370 --> 01:55:12.354]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[01:55:12.735 --> 01:55:14.817]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[01:55:15.157 --> 01:55:24.106]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout group.
[01:55:24.226 --> 01:55:24.666]  We're good.
[01:55:54.206 --> 01:55:57.587]  Have you ever noticed that celebrities are endorsing weight loss products and health aids?
[01:56:16.148 --> 01:56:18.829]  Do you think they endorse these products for free?
[01:56:19.969 --> 01:56:20.649]  I don't think so.
[01:56:20.929 --> 01:56:24.770]  I'm here to tell you, I'm not a celebrity and Life Change Tea doesn't need one.
[01:56:25.010 --> 01:56:25.910]  Think about this.
[01:56:26.251 --> 01:56:28.311]  The product speaks for itself.
[01:56:28.851 --> 01:56:29.971]  What a concept!
[01:56:30.432 --> 01:56:31.452]  Our product works.
[01:56:32.032 --> 01:56:34.092]  You get healthy and you'll lose weight.
[01:56:34.573 --> 01:56:35.233]  Summer's coming.
[01:56:35.453 --> 01:56:36.353]  Look and feel good.
[01:56:36.983 --> 01:56:38.524]  Order now.
[01:56:38.544 --> 01:56:38.805]  928-308-0408.
[01:56:39.085 --> 01:56:43.288]  Write this down.
[01:56:43.308 --> 01:56:44.669]  928-308-0408.
[01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:47.611]  Or you can order online.
[01:56:47.812 --> 01:56:48.272]  It's easy.
[01:56:48.592 --> 01:56:50.053]  GetTheTea.com.
[01:56:50.274 --> 01:56:52.515]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[01:56:52.776 --> 01:56:58.060]  You have nothing to lose but the excess around your, uh, anyway.
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:56:59.121]  Life Change Tea.
[01:56:59.421 --> 01:57:00.402]  It speaks for itself.
[01:57:00.942 --> 01:57:02.964]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[01:57:13.103 --> 01:57:14.124]  Okay, here's an example.
[01:57:14.204 --> 01:57:25.457]  I'm not going to say any names here on the news, but we were just having a discussion about, hey, I hope the listeners realize I'm not even bashing the Boy Scouts.
[01:57:26.498 --> 01:57:28.480]  Any organized thing
[01:57:29.611 --> 01:57:32.732]  With children today is going to have government perverts involved in it.
[01:57:33.252 --> 01:57:35.512]  The perverts know where to get in the system to operate.
[01:57:35.532 --> 01:57:40.373]  And the one guy here who's an Eagle Scout, he said, no, I had to switch troops because that was all going on.
[01:57:40.833 --> 01:57:42.274]  And I said, how bad was it?
[01:57:42.314 --> 01:57:46.554]  He's, uh, I don't want to even talk about it, but nothing happened to me, but I got out of there.
[01:57:47.295 --> 01:57:48.875]  That's what I'm talking about, folks.
[01:57:49.195 --> 01:57:51.455]  I'm here to warn people about what's going on.
[01:57:51.775 --> 01:57:53.196]  Don't drink the tap water.
[01:57:53.516 --> 01:57:57.897]  Don't put your kids in the Boy Scouts until you've got, you know what?
[01:57:58.477 --> 01:57:58.997]  I'll say this.
[01:58:00.154 --> 01:58:05.836]  I told my wife, I said, we can't have our son in the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts because I'm too busy to be there.
[01:58:06.216 --> 01:58:13.779]  I said, I know there's good troops and there's good people out there, but I'd have to be there at every meeting because nobody's getting near my kids.
[01:58:14.279 --> 01:58:16.360]  And I'm telling you folks, that's what this is.
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:19.681]  And by the way, the CPS expose is coming up in 30 minutes.
[01:58:20.581 --> 01:58:22.022]  It's coming up right now, 430 minutes.
[01:58:22.883 --> 01:58:25.885]  And then I'm going to continue with your phone calls and a giant news blitz.
[01:58:26.025 --> 01:58:27.126]  I am just out of control today.
[01:58:27.486 --> 01:58:33.230]  By the way, coming out in about two weeks, the film's done, the trailer's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:58:34.311 --> 01:58:42.457]  We had hundreds of requests to take the PrisonPlanet.tv interview we did with Aaron Russo, his last videotaped interview before he died of cancer, and to put it on DVD.
[01:58:43.197 --> 01:58:44.478]  And so we did that, and that's what it is.
[01:58:44.518 --> 01:58:46.280]  It's the interview with Aaron Russo, and there's like
[01:58:47.327 --> 01:58:53.110]  Ten minutes of interview that we didn't put on the web that's in there, and we put articles and documents over him talking, and I think it's very effective.
[01:58:53.390 --> 01:59:03.535]  It's been seen millions of times online, and it's all over the place, but this is upgraded and added and has some commentary where I update the latest info, and it's all about abolishing the Federal Reserve.
[01:59:03.855 --> 01:59:06.696]  So pre-order that at InfoWars.com.
[01:59:06.736 --> 01:59:08.877]  I think it's very important and it'll be effective to wake folks up.
[01:59:09.278 --> 01:59:13.320]  Plus, it's kind of an infomercial for Aaron and freedom of fascism and the work he's done.
[01:59:13.340 --> 01:59:15.441]  I hope folks appreciate that out there.
[01:59:16.201 --> 01:59:16.762]  God knows.
[01:59:20.004 --> 01:59:21.766]  Also, every month we're going to have a Best Of.
[01:59:22.126 --> 01:59:23.047]  This is January.
[01:59:23.107 --> 01:59:30.573]  It's David Icke and Alan Watt and a bunch of other people, Joe Rogan, and they're already up to four or five months in, but those are all being made right now.
[01:59:30.593 --> 01:59:36.757]  We're going to start offering each month's best interviews in a two-hour boil down with documents and music and things.
[01:59:37.478 --> 01:59:39.719]  That's 1495infowars.com.
[01:59:39.739 --> 01:59:45.922]  People kept asking for that, so we're going to have the DVD Arsenal for everybody at infowars.com as well.
[01:59:45.962 --> 01:59:47.483]  You can go get those.
[01:59:48.464 --> 01:59:51.845]  In fact, maybe run in the DVD of the one that's actually printed, the one that's done.
[01:59:52.325 --> 01:59:53.626]  It was around here somewhere, Rob.
[01:59:53.746 --> 01:59:54.567]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[01:59:54.587 --> 01:59:58.949]  Here's some of the covers of some of the future months that are coming out.
[02:00:00.174 --> 02:00:05.735]  Now, before I go any further, I also want to tell you about a few sponsors, because this is who makes the show possible.
[02:00:05.775 --> 02:00:07.436]  This one is just our fabulous folks.
[02:00:07.496 --> 02:00:08.556]  And when I say this, I mean it.
[02:00:08.876 --> 02:00:10.556]  They got the best prices I've seen anywhere.
[02:00:10.576 --> 02:00:12.417]  They've been around since 1994.
[02:00:13.277 --> 02:00:16.818]  And you better get tasers and stun guns before they start restricting them to the public.
[02:00:17.118 --> 02:00:20.939]  Because tasers and stun guns don't have the lobby that Second Amendment grips do.
[02:00:21.579 --> 02:00:25.780]  And I believe in these as great self-defense items in a lot of cities and states where guns are restricted.
[02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:30.081]  You can have a taser or a stun gun or pepper spray.
[02:00:30.401 --> 02:00:30.961]  Check them out.
[02:00:31.021 --> 02:00:32.281]  Pepperspray.com.
[02:00:32.321 --> 02:00:34.022]  That's Pepperspray.com.
[02:00:34.962 --> 02:00:38.482]  Stun guns, tasers, animal repellents, home safety, personal alarms.
[02:00:38.843 --> 02:00:39.983]  Pepperspray.
[02:00:40.123 --> 02:00:40.803]  Just one word.
[02:00:40.883 --> 02:00:41.223]  Pepper.
[02:00:41.283 --> 02:00:43.263]  P-E-P-P-E-R spray.
[02:00:43.403 --> 02:00:45.044]  S-P-R-A-Y.com.
[02:00:46.244 --> 02:00:52.209]  And there's a banner up on Infowars.com, and they just have fabulous deals on stun guns and tasers.
[02:00:52.229 --> 02:00:57.533]  You can check your state laws there, but it's just good to have these, and good to have it in your area.
[02:00:57.593 --> 02:00:58.813]  Almost everywhere it's legal still.
[02:00:59.214 --> 02:01:01.075]  So even areas where the Second Amendment's restricted.
[02:01:01.095 --> 02:01:02.376]  Or you can give them a call at 800-908-9988.
[02:01:02.396 --> 02:01:02.436]  800-908-9988.

[02:01:17.150 --> 02:01:19.433]  This is the solar backup unit to have.
[02:01:19.573 --> 02:01:20.354]  Great price.

[02:02:39.131 --> 02:02:40.032]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:03:13.456 --> 02:03:14.717]  We've got a guest coming up.
[02:03:14.757 --> 02:03:18.460]  Very articulate and really done Gilman's work.
[02:03:24.746 --> 02:03:26.948]  Battling with the establishment.
[02:03:28.429 --> 02:03:29.610]  Nancy Shaver.
[02:03:30.991 --> 02:03:35.014]  State Senator Nancy Shaver was the founder and president of Family Concerns, Inc.
[02:03:35.735 --> 02:03:37.557]  A non-profit organization located in Georgia.
[02:03:39.955 --> 02:03:45.699]  And we'll tell you a lot more about her when she comes on the show in just a little while.
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:58.568]  Let's get a few phone calls in right now on the heels of the news showing teenagers training with machine guns to kill veterans in the U.S.
[02:03:59.408 --> 02:04:01.770]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tony in New York.
[02:04:01.810 --> 02:04:02.450]  You're on the air.
[02:04:02.490 --> 02:04:02.851]  Welcome.
[02:04:03.951 --> 02:04:04.412]  Hi, Alex.
[02:04:04.812 --> 02:04:05.673]  Nice to meet you, sir.
[02:04:06.053 --> 02:04:06.453]  Hey, buddy.
[02:04:06.493 --> 02:04:07.234]  First time caller?
[02:04:08.755 --> 02:04:09.055]  Welcome.
[02:04:10.819 --> 02:04:11.800]  I got a question for you.
[02:04:12.381 --> 02:04:13.702]  I was in the military for eight years.
[02:04:13.762 --> 02:04:14.842]  I got out last year.
[02:04:14.862 --> 02:04:17.665]  A friend of mine, Mark, woke me up to your shows.
[02:04:17.745 --> 02:04:18.585]  I watched all your shows.
[02:04:18.625 --> 02:04:19.566]  Great shows, by the way.
[02:04:20.547 --> 02:04:31.715]  We spent about $300,000 to buy a piece of property in the middle of nowhere, got it set up for an emergency, and we picked four other people with good skills in certain areas to get it all set up.
[02:04:32.235 --> 02:04:35.918]  Now we live about two and a half hours away from this camp that we set up.
[02:04:36.363 --> 02:04:44.549]  Do you think by watching everything like a hawk and listening to you every day and everything, do you think we're going to have enough time to get out of here to get to that middle of nowhere place?
[02:04:44.569 --> 02:04:46.570]  Well, number one, you trust these people.
[02:04:46.971 --> 02:04:53.215]  Yeah, I mean, though it's fun to secret agent, I'm not saying you're doing this, to secret agent around and call it your secret camp, I'd call it your deer camp.
[02:04:54.296 --> 02:04:55.437]  And you're a gun club.
[02:04:56.217 --> 02:04:58.139]  And, you know, that's the end of it.
[02:05:00.447 --> 02:05:01.708]  I don't know your geography.
[02:05:01.728 --> 02:05:02.869]  I don't know what's around you.
[02:05:03.629 --> 02:05:07.111]  But what they'll do is they'll announce, oh, we've got a new plague that's been released.
[02:05:07.171 --> 02:05:08.192]  We don't know if it's deadly.
[02:05:08.212 --> 02:05:12.414]  And they'll do it enough times with kind of soft kill ones that aren't very strong.
[02:05:12.494 --> 02:05:16.217]  I've always said this, and I didn't just start saying this with the flu, folks, three weeks ago.
[02:05:17.131 --> 02:05:17.532]  I don't know.
[02:05:31.371 --> 02:05:42.440]  Every time there's some type of scare or bird flu thing going on, or if you hear a nuke went off ten states away from you, you better get out of the city then if you don't want to be locked down in the city.
[02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:46.723]  Now does that mean every time you leave that they're not going to lock down?
[02:05:46.743 --> 02:05:47.484]  No!
[02:05:47.884 --> 02:05:49.366]  But if you want to be safe,
[02:05:49.986 --> 02:05:56.955]  I mean, during this swine flu thing, I was saying probably staged, manufactured just to scare people, but we gotta take them serious when they say this.
[02:05:57.255 --> 02:05:59.739]  This could be their move because of what they've done in the past.
[02:06:00.299 --> 02:06:04.364]  I had my family on standby with packed bags of storable foods ready to leave.
[02:06:05.125 --> 02:06:06.667]  And I mean, we were on standby.
[02:06:07.188 --> 02:06:12.814]  And I was going to debate whether I'd jettison my family to a safe location, and whether I was going to stay here.
[02:06:12.834 --> 02:06:15.276]  I mean, it was going to be some killer thing, killing everybody.
[02:06:15.296 --> 02:06:20.861]  I was going to bring food and cots into my office, and I was going to stay here and go down with the ship, because, you know, that's our job.
[02:06:21.642 --> 02:06:22.783]  But where do you live?
[02:06:22.823 --> 02:06:25.886]  You say you live in New York, New York City, or New York State?
[02:06:25.906 --> 02:06:27.067]  Niagara Falls, New York.
[02:06:27.127 --> 02:06:28.889]  I literally live like 15 minutes.
[02:06:29.009 --> 02:06:30.551]  I could see the border from my house.
[02:06:31.138 --> 02:06:32.438]  Oh, well you're in a security zone.
[02:06:32.458 --> 02:06:40.100]  And I have a lot of back roads and everything that we planned out that we want to take any main roads or anything to get back down to the deer camp.
[02:06:40.641 --> 02:06:41.561]  Sounds like you got it in.
[02:06:41.581 --> 02:06:42.781]  We have all that planned out.
[02:06:43.221 --> 02:06:49.743]  We just don't, I'm just, we're watching everything like a hawk so we can try to figure out a trigger to when to get the hell out of here.
[02:06:51.323 --> 02:06:51.983]  Well, that's good.
[02:06:52.384 --> 02:06:53.985]  It sounds like you know what you're doing.
[02:06:54.005 --> 02:06:56.627]  Yeah, I would have a map with highlighted back roads.
[02:06:56.647 --> 02:07:00.489]  Of course, Homeland Security said in 2004 that's an act of terrorism.
[02:07:00.509 --> 02:07:02.911]  Never rode Atlas in your car, but terrorists are terrorists.
[02:07:02.931 --> 02:07:08.395]  You know, veterans, gun owners, Atlas owners, people wearing blue jeans, people with cell phones, people with white vans.
[02:07:08.655 --> 02:07:09.215]  That's all listed.
[02:07:09.315 --> 02:07:09.976]  Everything's listed.
[02:07:10.056 --> 02:07:11.797]  Everyone's a terrorist.
[02:07:11.817 --> 02:07:13.538]  And they've got the youth squads training.
[02:07:13.558 --> 02:07:16.400]  Hey, what do you think about the Boy Scouts training to hunt you down and kill you?
[02:07:18.201 --> 02:07:18.582]  It's insane.
[02:07:19.673 --> 02:07:20.394]  Well, but isn't it insane?
[02:07:20.454 --> 02:07:21.094]  I can't believe it.
[02:07:21.574 --> 02:07:23.576]  Every other nation that went to tyranny did that.
[02:07:24.816 --> 02:07:24.997]  Yep.
[02:07:25.697 --> 02:07:34.123]  Well, what's really weird is when I first went into military and I went in around 9-11, I ended up in Iraq twice.
[02:07:34.903 --> 02:07:38.005]  First time I came back, I noticed something different about my country.
[02:07:38.045 --> 02:07:39.106]  I love my country to death.
[02:07:39.890 --> 02:07:44.992]  Um, the second time I came back, it was just like, I don't recognize my own country anymore.
[02:07:45.012 --> 02:07:46.273]  Things have changed so much.
[02:07:46.593 --> 02:07:48.754]  They just had a big university do a study.
[02:07:48.794 --> 02:07:51.835]  The United States is the sixth worst police state in the world.
[02:07:52.296 --> 02:07:53.556]  England's the fifth worst.
[02:07:54.036 --> 02:07:56.818]  I mean, there's only North Korea and a few others ahead of us now.
[02:07:57.698 --> 02:08:01.640]  People don't realize, folks, that on the scale, we're as bad as it gets.
[02:08:01.700 --> 02:08:02.120]  Stay there.
[02:08:02.180 --> 02:08:02.500]  Stay there.
[02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:03.761]  I don't want to let you be able to finish up, sir.
[02:08:05.691 --> 02:08:07.272]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:08:07.392 --> 02:08:12.015]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:08:12.115 --> 02:08:14.876]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:08:15.076 --> 02:08:17.958]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:08:18.118 --> 02:08:22.841]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:08:23.081 --> 02:08:24.002]  If you simply prepare.
[02:08:24.202 --> 02:08:27.164]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:08:27.444 --> 02:08:34.350]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:08:34.450 --> 02:08:37.572]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:08:37.712 --> 02:08:37.912]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:08:37.972 --> 02:08:39.594]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[02:08:42.916 --> 02:08:44.618]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[02:09:09.534 --> 02:09:11.637]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:09:12.138 --> 02:09:19.148]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:09:19.722 --> 02:09:25.908]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:09:26.308 --> 02:09:28.150]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:09:28.290 --> 02:09:30.712]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:09:30.792 --> 02:09:41.742]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:09:42.363 --> 02:09:43.644]  It's not about left or right.
[02:09:44.045 --> 02:09:45.406]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:09:45.879 --> 02:09:52.227]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:09:52.787 --> 02:10:00.597]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:10:01.057 --> 02:10:02.219]  The Obama Deception.
[02:10:02.639 --> 02:10:03.841]  The people strike back.
[02:10:05.809 --> 02:10:08.970]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[02:10:09.330 --> 02:10:11.071]  Now, going green can save money.
[02:10:11.251 --> 02:10:16.573]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[02:10:16.793 --> 02:10:24.536]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[02:10:24.816 --> 02:10:35.500]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:35.920]  I think so.
[02:11:10.552 --> 02:11:11.192]  Big Brother.
[02:11:11.872 --> 02:11:12.933]  Mainstream media.
[02:11:13.633 --> 02:11:14.733]  Government cover-ups.
[02:11:15.393 --> 02:11:16.214]  You want answers?
[02:11:16.974 --> 02:11:18.474]  Well, so does he.
[02:11:18.534 --> 02:11:22.195]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:11:22.735 --> 02:11:26.817]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:11:27.317 --> 02:11:28.637]  Got Senator.
[02:11:39.949 --> 02:11:42.391]  Nancy Schaefer coming up in a moment.
[02:11:42.471 --> 02:11:44.273]  I meant to get to this story.
[02:11:44.933 --> 02:11:48.917]  Scientists arrested for smuggling vials used in Ebola research in the US.
[02:11:49.257 --> 02:11:52.920]  Then I saw the New York Times article we're linked to up on InfoWars.com.
[02:11:54.382 --> 02:12:04.631]  I already knew it, but the photos of Homeland Security training the Cub Scouts in paramilitary uniforms with submachine guns to hunt down US veterans.
[02:12:06.144 --> 02:12:09.226]  Of course, they put the veteran in a bad light, but the villain's always a veteran.
[02:12:09.266 --> 02:12:09.887]  You gotta kill him.
[02:12:10.967 --> 02:12:14.010]  It just blew me away, and I went into a tirade for 20 minutes, so we're behind.
[02:12:14.310 --> 02:12:19.513]  But Tony, a veteran that the Boy Scouts are training to hunt down, is in New York.
[02:12:19.533 --> 02:12:23.096]  You were talking about coming back to your country and not being able to recognize it.
[02:12:24.817 --> 02:12:34.044]  The reason the United States is rated by major university studies as the number six police state on the planet, number one being North Korea, and England's number five, I want to be sure about that.
[02:12:34.064 --> 02:12:35.585]  I had that article yesterday and never got to it.
[02:12:37.114 --> 02:12:37.474]  I've read it.
[02:12:38.415 --> 02:12:39.975]  In fact, guys, it's in the stack.
[02:12:39.995 --> 02:12:41.376]  Show people the stack here.
[02:12:41.396 --> 02:12:42.996]  This is three days.
[02:12:43.836 --> 02:12:47.358]  This is how much news comes in here, how much gets dumped on my desk, how much I bring in.
[02:12:47.798 --> 02:12:49.378]  This at the end of the week will be cleaned off.
[02:12:49.718 --> 02:12:54.920]  We've got to get a filing system for this, but then we've got to have like two people, three people just to go through all this when I need something.
[02:12:56.541 --> 02:12:57.601]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:12:58.361 --> 02:12:59.902]  Today's stuff is all right here.
[02:13:02.163 --> 02:13:03.083]  Anyways, the point is,
[02:13:04.204 --> 02:13:12.666]  That once they say we can secretly arrest you and secretly hold you and torture you, even if it's not implemented fully, the next step is total tyranny.
[02:13:13.206 --> 02:13:16.027]  So that's why we've now become one of the number one police states in the world.
[02:13:17.927 --> 02:13:23.609]  And now they're announcing, oh guess what, Homeland Security wasn't for the foreign Muslims or Arabs, and taking their rights is wrong.
[02:13:24.412 --> 02:13:26.853]  Yeah, quite a few of my friends are definitely waking up.
[02:13:26.873 --> 02:13:29.453]  What definitely woke up a few of my close vets friends is that
[02:13:49.609 --> 02:13:50.370]  I'm a warrant officer.
[02:13:50.410 --> 02:13:51.390]  I was a warrant officer.
[02:13:51.450 --> 02:13:52.971]  I flew an Apache.
[02:13:52.991 --> 02:13:58.915]  I had missiles that could kill thousands of people in my control.
[02:13:58.935 --> 02:14:03.218]  I come back here to try to get a handgun permit, and I was denied.
[02:14:04.239 --> 02:14:13.885]  Two, three other guys that I speak to online that I try to keep in touch with, they still are trying to apply for a handgun permit, and they can't even get them.
[02:14:14.285 --> 02:14:18.748]  So when you go on about that they're not letting us military officers get guns, they're not.
[02:14:19.457 --> 02:14:30.982]  I mean, I just don't understand how they can let us turn around and have missiles, access to missiles, but then when we go to apply for a handgun for our own protection in our own home, we get denied.
[02:14:31.442 --> 02:14:31.982]  No, I know.
[02:14:32.042 --> 02:14:33.623]  God bless you, sir, and I appreciate your call.
[02:14:35.003 --> 02:14:36.964]  Most people accuse me of exaggerating.
[02:14:37.124 --> 02:14:38.965]  It is the opposite in almost every case.
[02:14:41.546 --> 02:14:48.609]  I have studied the thousands of pieces of data coming in, and I can officially tell you, and we even have mainstream news admitting large portions of it.
[02:14:49.412 --> 02:14:53.095]  That they are phasing in not allowing veterans to own firearms.
[02:14:53.975 --> 02:14:56.858]  Now, you've seen the DHS report saying you're the main target and enemy.
[02:14:57.118 --> 02:14:59.640]  You've got the Boy Scouts training with machine guns to come kill you.
[02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:01.381]  Right out of Nazi Germany.
[02:15:02.262 --> 02:15:03.302]  Right out of Soviet Russia.
[02:15:03.322 --> 02:15:04.063]  I mean, right out.
[02:15:04.704 --> 02:15:08.146]  I mean, they're going down every type of tyranny there is and doing it.
[02:15:12.062 --> 02:15:13.742]  It was all set up decades ago.
[02:15:13.803 --> 02:15:15.723]  It doesn't matter if it's George Bush or Barack Obama.
[02:15:15.763 --> 02:15:18.864]  The agenda is the same, but it's all coming to a head under Obama.
[02:15:18.884 --> 02:15:22.465]  He's their closer, as George Humphrey has said eloquently here on air.
[02:15:23.285 --> 02:15:25.286]  I mean, absolutely, he is the closer.
[02:15:25.726 --> 02:15:27.366]  He is the guy that's doing all of this.
[02:15:32.228 --> 02:15:38.750]  So, it just absolutely boggles my mind and makes my head spin.
[02:15:42.130 --> 02:15:44.952]  That this is going on and uh... there is no doubt.
[02:15:44.972 --> 02:15:48.734]  Remember Clinton tried it in 2000 right before he left office.
[02:15:49.555 --> 02:15:53.097]  There was an article about 86,000 vets put on a list not being able to own guns.
[02:15:53.458 --> 02:15:54.338]  And they wouldn't say why.
[02:15:54.738 --> 02:16:01.063]  And now the head of the White House Chief of Staff says we're going to put you on a no-gun list like a no-fly list.
[02:16:01.803 --> 02:16:07.727]  And then now they've introduced the bill saying we'll secretly say you can't own guns and the Attorney General can ban any guns he wants.
[02:16:07.787 --> 02:16:08.968]  Just give him the power.
[02:16:09.388 --> 02:16:10.209]  It's happening!
[02:16:11.431 --> 02:16:23.756]  British reporters for one of the biggest newspapers in the world, London Guardian, goes to Greece and tries to photograph a huge hotel with our leaders illegally meeting in it to set policy, Logan Act, and they come and arrest him twice!
[02:16:25.177 --> 02:16:28.258]  They don't care if he's with one of the top ten papers in the world!
[02:16:28.558 --> 02:16:29.839]  None of that matters now!
[02:16:32.039 --> 02:16:33.700]  All right, I'm going to shut up and go to our guest.
[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:44.247]  I saw a YouTube video of her giving a speech and in five minutes she boiled everything down I try to explain about the CPS and the bounties on taking kids and how there's no due process.
[02:16:45.768 --> 02:16:47.049]  She's State Senator 50th District.
[02:16:49.622 --> 02:16:54.883]  Senator Schaffer serves her constituency in eight counties that make up 50th District in Georgia.
[02:16:55.443 --> 02:17:00.124]  She's got a long, illustrious career out there fighting corruption.
[02:17:00.144 --> 02:17:03.945]  She's also the head in her state of the Eagle Forum.
[02:17:05.745 --> 02:17:09.806]  And so she now joins us and we appreciate her standing up eloquently and fighting this.
[02:17:10.486 --> 02:17:12.487]  And so we appreciate Senator Schaffer for coming on.
[02:17:12.527 --> 02:17:13.867]  Nancy, it's good to have you here with us.
[02:17:14.307 --> 02:17:14.687]  Thank you.
[02:17:14.727 --> 02:17:16.008]  It's good to be on with you.
[02:17:16.028 --> 02:17:17.988]  I appreciate all you're doing.
[02:17:18.885 --> 02:17:26.695]  Thanks for holding while I was ranting for five minutes about the DHS document saying veterans are the number one threat to homeland security.
[02:17:27.315 --> 02:17:30.699]  Were you aware they're training the Boy Scouts for gun confiscation?
[02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:33.463]  Well, you know, I've heard that they are training boys.
[02:17:33.563 --> 02:17:35.025]  I didn't know that it's Boy Scouts.
[02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:40.364]  That's Boy Scouts, school groups, public school groups, this is just one.
[02:17:41.004 --> 02:17:45.349]  What do you think of all the new documents coming out demonizing veterans on a separate issue?
[02:17:45.509 --> 02:17:46.170]  Oh, it's awful.
[02:17:46.730 --> 02:17:48.292]  It's just awful.
[02:17:48.312 --> 02:17:53.317]  It's unconstitutional, and it's wrong, and you just can't see the direction that we're headed.
[02:17:54.873 --> 02:17:56.214]  I gotta be honest with you, Senator.
[02:17:56.234 --> 02:17:59.956]  I mean, I knew the globalists were evil, but it's even hard for me to believe they're this bold.
[02:18:00.476 --> 02:18:01.497]  Yes, it is.
[02:18:01.537 --> 02:18:04.319]  Training 14-year-olds to go after the military?
[02:18:04.439 --> 02:18:07.461]  I mean, that's right out of East Germany.
[02:18:07.861 --> 02:18:08.361]  That's right.
[02:18:08.421 --> 02:18:12.424]  This is that community service that we're hearing all about.
[02:18:12.444 --> 02:18:14.405]  Absolutely.
[02:18:14.425 --> 02:18:16.986]  But it certainly has a different definition, doesn't it?
[02:18:17.307 --> 02:18:17.947]  Yes, it does.
[02:18:18.347 --> 02:18:22.330]  Ma'am, I'm gonna try to just sit back and shut up, because I'd like you to break down
[02:18:23.621 --> 02:18:38.108]  But with a little bit more time, what you gave in that speech, I know you've given a lot, but I saw this particular speech of you, I believe, before the Eagle Forum, really laying out the facts of just how unconstitutional and Kafka-esque the CPS is.
[02:18:38.729 --> 02:18:39.009]  Right.
[02:18:39.229 --> 02:18:53.096]  Well, it is unconstitutional, and I'm sure you have many listeners that know that children are being taken away from their parents in a ruthless kind of behavior by caseworkers and social workers and investigators.
[02:18:54.017 --> 02:19:05.463]  And the bureaucracy is very huge that also includes lawyers and judges and therapists and others who take these children from their parents without a cause.
[02:19:05.983 --> 02:19:21.211]  And of course we know that money is being made because of this and I'm convinced without a shadow of a doubt that parents across this country need to be warned of the dangers of the Child Protective Services nationwide.
[02:19:24.323 --> 02:19:26.284]  You want me to just continue on, don't you?
[02:19:26.304 --> 02:19:27.785]  Sure, Senator, lay it out.
[02:19:27.925 --> 02:19:39.109]  The Department of Child Protective Services has become a protected empire that we see going on around us and it's built on taking children and separating families.
[02:19:39.129 --> 02:19:50.634]  As a matter of fact, I could throw in here now that it appears to me that the family is going to have to be destroyed in order for the one world government to completely develop.
[02:19:51.215 --> 02:19:51.835]  But this is
[02:19:52.970 --> 02:19:56.213]  The taking of children by a protected empire.
[02:19:56.233 --> 02:20:12.687]  This is not to say today that there are not those children who are really being abused, who need to be removed from the wretched situations that they may be in.
[02:20:12.707 --> 02:20:15.249]  But it needs to be done through due process.
[02:20:15.629 --> 02:20:17.851]  Yes, that's not what we're talking about.
[02:20:18.071 --> 02:20:19.072]  We're talking about
[02:20:19.505 --> 02:20:29.011]  The families that are having children removed from them with no cause, and then there is no DUPROF available to them after this has happened.
[02:20:29.571 --> 02:20:48.802]  And in one county in my district, I had 37 families brought together one Saturday morning in the library to allow them to, without any press and without any Child Protective Services pressure there, to tell their stories.
[02:20:49.520 --> 02:21:15.039]  And it was absolutely unbelievable to hear these parents, single dads, single mothers, and other parents telling their stories of how their children had been picked up in the middle of the night, off of the school buses, out of schools, out of hospitals, even while they are nursing, and these families had never seen those children again.
[02:21:16.300 --> 02:21:19.402]  You have never seen such agony, such suffering,
[02:21:19.887 --> 02:21:20.888]  And such crying.
[02:21:21.368 --> 02:21:30.534]  And we had 50 families standing outside the door that were not allowed to come in because we already had 37 families inside.
[02:21:31.214 --> 02:21:41.981]  It was truly just seeing the work of the Gestapo coming against these families and taking their children from them, never to be seen again.
[02:21:42.441 --> 02:21:45.463]  It was very, very enlightening.
[02:21:45.856 --> 02:21:55.738]  That day was when we saw what was happening in this one Child Protective Services Department in one county in my district in Georgia.
[02:21:56.338 --> 02:22:06.260]  And not only that, but they had a separate business going on where they required all of these parents to come in multiple times and have drug tests.
[02:22:06.900 --> 02:22:11.361]  And they charged the parents every time so they had a separate business going on.
[02:22:11.441 --> 02:22:13.222]  They had already made over $100,000 in this business.
[02:22:15.930 --> 02:22:16.850]  Well, Senator, stay there.
[02:22:16.910 --> 02:22:20.312]  Let's come back and break down the abuses of the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[02:22:20.332 --> 02:22:26.734]  For those that don't know, they set up, at the turn of the last century, these family courts that don't follow the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[02:22:26.754 --> 02:22:31.536]  They were actually set up to carry out racial hygiene, or they were first called eugenics courts.
[02:22:32.356 --> 02:22:36.199]  And that's why they're separate and new and outside of the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[02:22:36.239 --> 02:22:37.200]  It's all completely illegal.
[02:22:37.900 --> 02:22:51.029]  And it's come out in the news, all these family court judges are getting illegal kickbacks from the private CPS facilities because they're getting federal funds and they pay the judges in some cases millions of dollars apiece.
[02:22:51.049 --> 02:22:54.592]  So that's all this is, is a bounty on your children.
[02:22:55.112 --> 02:22:56.994]  We tend to focus on the CPS workers
[02:22:58.256 --> 02:22:59.640]  The real evil is the judges.
[02:22:59.681 --> 02:23:01.967]  They're the ones making the big money and the private groups.
[02:23:02.108 --> 02:23:02.770]  Stay with us, Senator.
[02:23:05.757 --> 02:23:12.742]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[02:23:12.982 --> 02:23:17.265]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:23:17.525 --> 02:23:22.628]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[02:23:23.149 --> 02:23:30.253]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[02:23:30.674 --> 02:23:35.577]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[02:23:36.037 --> 02:23:41.498]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:23:41.878 --> 02:23:47.399]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.
[02:23:47.679 --> 02:23:53.400]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.

[02:24:06.238 --> 02:24:11.483]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:24:12.285 --> 02:24:17.608]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:24:18.148 --> 02:24:24.332]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:24:24.652 --> 02:24:26.473]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:24:26.633 --> 02:24:29.014]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:24:29.094 --> 02:24:39.960]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:24:42.265 --> 02:24:43.526]  It's not about left or right.
[02:24:43.926 --> 02:24:45.326]  It's about a one world government.
[02:24:45.786 --> 02:24:52.149]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:25:02.532 --> 02:25:03.713]  The people strike back.
[02:25:05.928 --> 02:25:08.629]  Are you tired of losing your hard-earned savings in retirement?
[02:25:09.029 --> 02:25:15.592]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[02:25:16.072 --> 02:25:20.334]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.

[02:25:30.854 --> 02:25:40.576]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years compared to our present fiat currency, which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[02:25:40.916 --> 02:25:48.278]  Call me Dwayne Dally at 800-686-2237 extension 115 to start your protection of wealth today.
[02:25:48.298 --> 02:25:51.738]  I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.
[02:25:52.239 --> 02:25:53.559]  No amount is too small.
[02:25:53.639 --> 02:25:54.459]  So start today.
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:03.745]  Call Duane Daly with Midas Resources at 800-686-2237 extension 115 for your gold and silver protection portfolio.
[02:26:05.466 --> 02:26:06.307]  Attention gardeners!
[02:26:06.367 --> 02:26:08.728]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[02:26:08.968 --> 02:26:13.291]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[02:26:13.491 --> 02:26:21.376]  It's called ProtoGrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[02:26:21.676 --> 02:26:24.518]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[02:26:24.798 --> 02:26:32.344]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[02:26:32.444 --> 02:26:38.027]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[02:26:38.268 --> 02:26:43.811]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[02:26:44.092 --> 02:26:47.334]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[02:26:47.634 --> 02:26:50.998]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[02:26:51.219 --> 02:26:56.265]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dervsheep superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[02:26:56.305 --> 02:26:59.169]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:26:59.189 --> 02:26:59.389]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:27:14.941 --> 02:27:25.525]  Alright, Nancy Schaefer, state head of the Eagle Forum, state senator, 50th district.
[02:27:26.346 --> 02:27:30.167]  Well, this is an apropos song to have coming on right now.
[02:27:30.227 --> 02:27:34.529]  You can throw your rock, hide your hand, working against the
[02:27:36.050 --> 02:27:43.982]  People and it's just amazing what the establishment are doing as they work against their fellow man.
[02:27:44.462 --> 02:27:46.465]  Always advertising how it's for the children.
[02:27:46.525 --> 02:27:47.867]  It's a giant industry.
[02:27:49.256 --> 02:27:51.917]  And really people with some nasty folks.
[02:27:52.477 --> 02:27:58.038]  There's some that just want the money of kidnapping the kids, but the others like to do horrible things with the children.
[02:27:58.058 --> 02:27:59.439]  That's been proven in all over the news.
[02:28:00.019 --> 02:28:06.901]  Senator, so when did you begin to discover these horrors and what has your fight been like?
[02:28:07.041 --> 02:28:17.924]  I mean, because I know discovering this back 12, 14 years ago and fighting it myself and getting calls at hospitals when a newborn baby is literally jerked off the mother's breast with no judge's order even.
[02:28:18.784 --> 02:28:20.424]  I mean, it shook me to the core.
[02:28:20.444 --> 02:28:26.106]  It's made me actually cry when you're around the families and see the pain, because it's worse than a death.
[02:28:26.606 --> 02:28:31.027]  When Grandma dies, she's old, you love her, but you expect it to happen, and it's sad.
[02:28:31.707 --> 02:28:39.949]  But when you see families with the joy turned into a nightmare with their young being snatched, it hits you at a core level.
[02:28:41.252 --> 02:28:46.595]  And frankly, it tears your guts out, and then I'm going to be honest, then you want to kill people.
[02:28:46.995 --> 02:28:51.678]  Senator, tell us about your journey, and then more of the horrors.
[02:28:52.239 --> 02:28:53.579]  Well, it has been horrible.
[02:28:53.759 --> 02:28:54.420]  It really has.
[02:28:54.700 --> 02:29:06.567]  And let me just say up front here now that my writing the corrupt business of Child Protective Services, which you probably have read at some point or another,
[02:29:07.082 --> 02:29:14.486]  That prompted me, of course, to give the speech at Eagle Forum for the conference last year, at the end of the year.
[02:29:14.506 --> 02:29:18.329]  I lost my Senate seat over this.
[02:29:20.029 --> 02:29:28.334]  And in working, and let me say that there are causes worth losing over, so it hasn't distressed me that much.
[02:29:28.975 --> 02:29:32.997]  It's just given me more time to work on this issue and other issues.
[02:29:33.789 --> 02:29:50.043]  But in calling around the country to other state representatives and senators, asking them would they help this family or that family that have been contacting me, they have told me that if they help, if they do anything, they will lose their job.
[02:29:51.584 --> 02:29:52.585]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:29:52.985 --> 02:29:53.866]  Oh, it's a mafia.
[02:29:54.086 --> 02:29:56.488]  And of course it cost me my Senate seat.
[02:29:56.809 --> 02:29:57.689]  But that's okay.
[02:29:57.729 --> 02:29:58.250]  That's okay.
[02:29:58.270 --> 02:29:59.351]  We're moving forward.
[02:29:59.431 --> 02:30:01.913]  We're exposing what is being done.
[02:30:02.492 --> 02:30:06.235]  And you mentioned a few minutes ago about the judges and the money.
[02:30:06.535 --> 02:30:17.062]  I wanted to share with you that the Census Bureau has reported that in 2002, $40 billion in transfer payments were made between households.
[02:30:17.702 --> 02:30:23.506]  That money is under the direction and the control of family court judges.
[02:30:25.708 --> 02:30:27.489]  And that's on the tip of the iceberg, of course.
[02:30:27.509 --> 02:30:28.029]  That's right.
[02:30:28.169 --> 02:30:32.032]  You break this down so well, but there's bounties on children's heads.
[02:30:32.461 --> 02:30:33.241]  Yes, there are.
[02:30:33.422 --> 02:30:44.727]  As a matter of fact, we just learned a few days ago that an order had even been placed to one of our Child Protective Services departments for a particular kind of child that they wanted.
[02:30:45.228 --> 02:30:47.049]  So there is a bounty on these children.
[02:30:47.389 --> 02:30:57.494]  As a matter of fact, when you break it down as to exactly what is happening to promote these financial incentives, you have to go back
[02:30:58.052 --> 02:31:11.279]  To the Adoption and the Safe Families Act that was set in motion in 1974 by Walter Mondale and then later was expanded upon by President Bill Clinton in 1997.
[02:31:11.979 --> 02:31:20.164]  And what this act did is it offered cash bonuses to the states for every child they adopted out of foster care.
[02:31:20.864 --> 02:31:24.046]  So in order to receive the adoption incentive bonuses
[02:31:24.486 --> 02:31:28.008]  Local Child Protective Services need more children.
[02:31:28.609 --> 02:31:32.971]  They must have merchandise, which is the children that sells.
[02:31:33.572 --> 02:31:36.533]  And you must have plenty so that the buyer can choose.
[02:31:37.094 --> 02:31:47.840]  Some counties are known to give $4,000 to $6,000 bonus for each child adopted out to strangers and an additional $2,000 for special needs children.
[02:31:48.360 --> 02:31:54.104]  And of course this money just continues to follow the child and follow the child for years and years and years.
[02:31:54.620 --> 02:31:58.383]  And the employees work to keep those federal dollars flowing.
[02:31:58.623 --> 02:32:14.613]  And that's why 67% of children nationally, and that must be the average in Texas as well, we have the state hearings on this, are on multiple psychotropic drugs because once they give them a designation, then the cash amount goes way up.
[02:32:15.013 --> 02:32:15.574]  That's right.
[02:32:15.954 --> 02:32:17.015]  You're exactly right.
[02:32:17.275 --> 02:32:18.476]  You're exactly right.
[02:32:18.956 --> 02:32:20.517]  There's a baseline number
[02:32:20.916 --> 02:32:36.254]  There's a baseline number that I've expected adoptions based on population for each state for every child at DHR or Child Protective Services or whatever it's called in your particular state.
[02:32:36.727 --> 02:32:37.467]  We're on the march.
[02:32:37.507 --> 02:32:38.588]  The empire's on the run.
[02:32:38.648 --> 02:32:40.809]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:05.467 --> 02:33:10.670]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from the resistant new strains of deadly bacteria and viruses?
[02:33:11.071 --> 02:33:19.256]  Check out SupernaturalSilver.com today or visit the link on InfoWars.com to find out more about this incredible new silver compound.
[02:33:19.356 --> 02:33:26.160]  The new silver solution is a natural antibiotic that is clinically tested to kill viruses, germs, bacteria, and yeast safely.
[02:33:26.460 --> 02:33:31.143]  This new silver solution liquid form was shown to be a powerful preventative
[02:33:31.428 --> 02:33:32.289]  We're good to go.
[02:33:49.045 --> 02:33:49.265]  Thank you.
[02:34:06.258 --> 02:34:11.563]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:34:12.063 --> 02:34:19.069]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:34:19.637 --> 02:34:25.858]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:34:26.219 --> 02:34:28.059]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:34:28.199 --> 02:34:30.620]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:34:30.700 --> 02:34:41.642]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:34:42.262 --> 02:34:43.563]  It's not about left or right.
[02:34:43.943 --> 02:34:45.303]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:34:45.814 --> 02:34:52.141]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:35:00.990 --> 02:35:02.131]  The Obama Deception.
[02:35:02.551 --> 02:35:03.753]  The people strike back.
[02:35:05.970 --> 02:35:09.512]  Hi, my name is MZ, owner of KSCO in Santa Cruz, California.
[02:35:09.692 --> 02:35:15.555]  And like Alex Jones, I'm passionate about talk radio, that great bastion of freedom of expression for us all.
[02:35:15.695 --> 02:35:29.502]  I'm also passionate about helping people know the joys, benefits, and surprisingly simple methods of becoming entrepreneurs who work for themselves and not as wage slaves for someone else, or even worse, for large companies with no heart and soul, nor loyalty to their employees.
[02:35:29.762 --> 02:35:48.945]  If you are tired of being dependent on others for a living and ready to start owning yourself, loving your work, and setting the sky as the limit for your earning potential, I want you to know about an exciting great business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that actually helps people lose weight and can help them make money, perhaps lots of it, just by helping us spread the word about this wonderful unique product.
[02:35:49.025 --> 02:35:51.805]  Get on the web and go to chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[02:35:51.885 --> 02:35:53.966]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[02:35:54.066 --> 02:35:55.266]  And check out our opportunity.
[02:35:55.306 --> 02:35:56.626]  You'll know pretty quick if you're interested.
[02:35:56.686 --> 02:35:58.987]  If you are, we will connect with you and get you up and running.
[02:35:59.027 --> 02:36:02.387]  We don't want any money from you, and you'll be amazed at how simple this system is.
[02:36:02.507 --> 02:36:04.908]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[02:36:09.388 --> 02:36:14.929]  You know, it's hard to talk about this subject, but listeners need to understand something.
[02:36:15.049 --> 02:36:15.630]  I've lived it.
[02:36:15.730 --> 02:36:16.250]  I've viewed it.
[02:36:16.350 --> 02:36:16.890]  I've watched it.
[02:36:16.930 --> 02:36:17.930]  I've been to family courts.
[02:36:19.482 --> 02:36:21.924]  Here in Austin it's so corrupt, it's not just little kids they're grabbing.
[02:36:22.525 --> 02:36:26.928]  If you're late to class three times in Travis County, they charge you with truancy.
[02:36:27.689 --> 02:36:32.293]  Now the state statute says it's way above ten unexcused absences in one semester.
[02:36:32.533 --> 02:36:35.535]  Last time I checked the law, it changes sometimes.
[02:36:35.615 --> 02:36:37.337]  But to the point, it's a whole bunch of absences.
[02:36:38.746 --> 02:36:45.388]  But they have portable buildings built on, and they send these family court judges out, and they call the parents in the morning, and they put this on CBS News.
[02:36:45.408 --> 02:36:47.149]  I mean, I knew it was happening, but it was on the news.
[02:36:47.189 --> 02:36:49.849]  They commit this crime right out in the open like it's good.
[02:36:51.210 --> 02:36:58.272]  And they say, you were late to class, and you're going to sign this agreement, or I'm going to put you in juvenile hall for six months.
[02:36:59.032 --> 02:37:01.273]  Now, the judge, she goes, for contempt.
[02:37:01.293 --> 02:37:04.814]  It was Judge Jeanne Meir, who has huge facilities named after her.
[02:37:04.834 --> 02:37:05.674]  Talk about witch-like.
[02:37:06.154 --> 02:37:07.955]  And she was on there going, you understand?
[02:37:08.905 --> 02:37:11.329]  You know, with this face on TV, I gotta find that clip somewhere.
[02:37:11.369 --> 02:37:12.450]  She's like, you understand me?
[02:37:12.470 --> 02:37:13.913]  And the dad's like, do what it says.
[02:37:14.093 --> 02:37:14.734]  And the kid's crying.
[02:37:14.974 --> 02:37:16.016]  I'm sorry I was late to class.
[02:37:16.236 --> 02:37:16.657]  I'm sorry.
[02:37:17.177 --> 02:37:18.239]  Then you sign.
[02:37:18.299 --> 02:37:20.022]  Now they've got you contractually.
[02:37:20.082 --> 02:37:20.963]  That was the trick.
[02:37:22.105 --> 02:37:23.307]  She couldn't have put you in jail.
[02:37:24.682 --> 02:37:28.384]  Now they've got you contractually affirmed a judification.
[02:37:28.504 --> 02:37:30.446]  Now you're in the system.
[02:37:30.526 --> 02:37:31.226]  Now they got you.
[02:37:31.246 --> 02:37:40.052]  And it's come out, judges all over the country, getting over a million bucks apiece in many cases, to put girls who were late to class in jail in Ohio or in Illinois.
[02:37:40.072 --> 02:37:44.014]  A girl wrote something bad about her principal making fun of him.
[02:37:44.274 --> 02:37:47.716]  And they arrested her and gave her six months in a labor camp.
[02:37:47.796 --> 02:37:48.457]  Remember that?
[02:37:48.637 --> 02:37:49.898]  We can pull it up right now if you don't believe us.
[02:37:50.658 --> 02:37:57.462]  And it turned out the judge was getting over a million bucks a year to fill the private prisons, and they were doing kickbacks.
[02:37:57.662 --> 02:37:58.923]  Oh man, keep them coming.
[02:37:58.963 --> 02:38:00.464]  Oh God, the federal money is incredible.
[02:38:00.684 --> 02:38:01.705]  Keep them coming, we need more.
[02:38:02.205 --> 02:38:03.866]  I mean, this is like Shawshank Redemption.
[02:38:04.326 --> 02:38:08.849]  So, take my film, Endgame, and then we're going to the Senator.
[02:38:10.210 --> 02:38:17.214]  In there we have a clip from the State Senate, and the representative, Susanna Hupp, asked her,
[02:38:19.369 --> 02:38:23.315]  She says, why do you put 60-plus percent of the children on Prozac-type drugs?
[02:38:23.415 --> 02:38:28.002]  And the head state board psychiatrist says, well, they have bad genes.
[02:38:29.284 --> 02:38:30.867]  There's no test for bad genes.
[02:38:30.907 --> 02:38:31.207]  They do.
[02:38:31.247 --> 02:38:32.269]  They just make it up.
[02:38:33.516 --> 02:38:36.837]  Anyways, I gotta... Ma'am, please continue with the bounties.
[02:38:37.318 --> 02:38:39.799]  Because we've confirmed these, but you separately brought them up.
[02:38:40.059 --> 02:38:44.321]  For folks that don't know, the adoption agencies put out little bounties.
[02:38:44.341 --> 02:38:47.682]  This is all even done on the up-and-up, but there's also a little under the table.
[02:38:47.982 --> 02:38:50.544]  Tell us about the bounties on people's children.
[02:38:52.264 --> 02:39:00.588]  Certainly, these children come with bounties because we know the incentives are available, the federal incentives are available.
[02:39:01.377 --> 02:39:02.858]  And they can be 4,000 or 6,000.
[02:39:04.099 --> 02:39:09.722]  But actually, there is a beginning formula in which each bonus is multiplied.
[02:39:10.223 --> 02:39:11.864]  And this sounds complicated.
[02:39:11.944 --> 02:39:13.024]  It really isn't.
[02:39:13.084 --> 02:39:14.806]  But this is what the states go by.
[02:39:15.206 --> 02:39:22.410]  Each bonus is multiplied by the percentage that the state has managed to exceed its baseline adoption number.
[02:39:22.871 --> 02:39:29.715]  Therefore, the states and local communities work hard to reach their goals for increased numbers of adoptions.
[02:39:30.146 --> 02:39:30.286]  Okay.
[02:39:48.433 --> 02:39:57.376]  Their formula or their bonus increases on the wall, and it tells exactly how many more children they need by the end of the year.
[02:39:57.696 --> 02:40:00.257]  So it's just like a sales shop at a car dealership.
[02:40:00.297 --> 02:40:03.199]  They got the sales manager, and you're not going to reach your goal, Bob!
[02:40:03.219 --> 02:40:04.719]  That's exactly right.
[02:40:04.939 --> 02:40:06.000]  That's exactly right.
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:12.102]  In the cases I saw, in this one case, there was this auto mechanic and his young wife
[02:40:13.453 --> 02:40:15.775]  And she had tested positive three years before.
[02:40:15.935 --> 02:40:19.378]  They don't tell you when you're at the hospital, they're testing your blood, and they go, she's got marijuana in her.
[02:40:19.738 --> 02:40:23.482]  No judge, no jury, no second test, no process.
[02:40:23.502 --> 02:40:25.403]  They come and take the blonde-haired, blue-eyed baby.
[02:40:26.164 --> 02:40:30.107]  Well, this is three years later, and so they contacted my show, and they said, we're pregnant.
[02:40:30.127 --> 02:40:31.348]  We're going back in the hospital.
[02:40:31.729 --> 02:40:33.090]  We just want to make sure they don't try to take him.
[02:40:34.295 --> 02:40:34.876]  They call.
[02:40:35.356 --> 02:40:36.578]  I leave the radio that day.
[02:40:36.678 --> 02:40:37.539]  I drive down there.
[02:40:38.139 --> 02:40:39.120]  I go in with a camera.
[02:40:39.140 --> 02:40:40.081]  The cops say, turn your camera off.
[02:40:40.121 --> 02:40:40.782]  I say no.
[02:40:41.283 --> 02:40:45.668]  We open the door up and the cop, and Mike Hanson was a witness to this.
[02:40:45.688 --> 02:40:46.909]  The camera doesn't pick it up very well.
[02:40:47.850 --> 02:40:49.131]  Mike Hanson was there.
[02:40:49.992 --> 02:40:50.873]  He got there even before me.
[02:40:52.938 --> 02:40:55.999]  The cop actually had his hand on her neck making her sign it.
[02:40:56.039 --> 02:40:57.139]  You can't make this stuff up.
[02:40:57.179 --> 02:40:58.459]  This country's so gone, folks.
[02:40:59.259 --> 02:41:03.060]  Because they have special CPS cops just assigned to them who are particularly devilish.
[02:41:03.820 --> 02:41:05.581]  And they took the baby off her breast.
[02:41:05.601 --> 02:41:06.841]  The newborn baby disappeared.
[02:41:06.861 --> 02:41:07.801]  And then we go to the court.
[02:41:08.241 --> 02:41:10.202]  They didn't even fill out the right name.
[02:41:10.502 --> 02:41:14.662]  They said the baby was three years old and that this lady had done all this abuse.
[02:41:14.802 --> 02:41:17.683]  The forms aren't just lies.
[02:41:18.003 --> 02:41:21.484]  They're so lazy and so criminal, they don't even care.
[02:41:22.344 --> 02:41:23.785]  They just use old forms!
[02:41:25.145 --> 02:41:26.306]  Have you ever seen that, Senator?
[02:41:26.846 --> 02:41:29.447]  Well, I haven't exactly seen that.
[02:41:29.607 --> 02:41:34.689]  I do know that they take children right out of the hospitals and sometimes they're one or two days old.
[02:41:35.229 --> 02:41:41.032]  But the case workers and social workers oftentimes, very often, are guilty of fraud.
[02:41:41.452 --> 02:41:43.133]  And they do withhold the evidence.
[02:41:43.213 --> 02:41:44.953]  And they fabricate the evidence.
[02:41:45.393 --> 02:41:50.396]  And their whole goal is to terminate the parental right of the parent.
[02:41:52.242 --> 02:41:52.542]  I think so.
[02:42:09.045 --> 02:42:13.127]  And the law was written, for those that don't know, I'd like you to speak to this, because I know you're an expert on it, so you can speak to it.
[02:42:13.927 --> 02:42:18.009]  It was written to where, oh, we're supposed to keep the family together and give it to grandparents or the other spouse.
[02:42:18.649 --> 02:42:29.033]  Grandparents are now, don't like how the parents are operating, they advertise on TV to tattle, the grandparents go and tattle, and then they don't get the children nine times out of ten.
[02:42:30.074 --> 02:42:30.314]  Yes.
[02:42:31.014 --> 02:42:32.835]  There are lots of grandparents that
[02:42:33.499 --> 02:42:40.702]  That cannot get their grandchildren even when it would be best if the grand... Say the parents are on drugs.
[02:42:41.262 --> 02:42:44.384]  Someone does need to have access to those children.
[02:42:44.604 --> 02:42:47.425]  But often times the grandparents are turned down.
[02:42:47.965 --> 02:42:54.768]  Now there is a policy that you're supposed to secure a relative immediately for those parents.
[02:42:55.048 --> 02:42:57.990]  But often times that relative is never sought out.
[02:42:58.310 --> 02:43:00.671]  The grandparents are never given the children.
[02:43:01.409 --> 02:43:06.334]  And a stranger then comes in and takes over the lives of those children.
[02:43:06.795 --> 02:43:19.127]  And there is no, absolutely no financial resource or no real drive to unite the family back together or to keep them together or to provide any effective care for the family.
[02:43:19.467 --> 02:43:20.809]  That is completely gone.
[02:43:21.129 --> 02:43:23.972]  Now it's just, it's destroying the family.
[02:43:24.875 --> 02:43:31.220]  Well, right out of high school, I learned about this because for a summer I worked for a large carpet cleaning place.
[02:43:32.961 --> 02:43:40.467]  And we would go to these houses, because we might go to 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 houses a day sometimes, and I'd say, what is this?
[02:43:41.713 --> 02:44:05.975]  And it'd be usually a middle-class house, five bedroom, parts of it would be nice, there'd be rooms locked, there'd be kids walking around in shorts with their shirts off, you know, ages three to ten, there'd be marijuana smoke, there'd be some fat, it'd always look the same, some pervert-looking adult, and then, you know, because you'd be in a two-man team, and I was with the older guy who knew about it, he goes, oh, this is some foster parent house.
[02:44:05.995 --> 02:44:08.237]  And I'm not attacking all foster parents, folks, but
[02:44:08.937 --> 02:44:09.677]  I saw what it is.
[02:44:09.737 --> 02:44:23.521]  It's lazy potheads or alcoholics that get four or five kids and that's their business, is they warehouse them and they're always getting caught killing them or locking them up or giving them one hot dog a day, bread and water, because they want all that money for their drug habit.
[02:44:23.962 --> 02:44:30.123]  And that's why I've seen statistics of foster parents being five times more likely to abuse children than any other group.
[02:44:31.224 --> 02:44:32.204]  You're exactly right.
[02:44:32.744 --> 02:44:37.866]  The children are much more likely to be abused in foster care than at home with their own parents.
[02:44:39.807 --> 02:44:48.713]  The beginning of this journey for me began with a grandmother who was trying to get her two granddaughters in one of the counties in my district.
[02:44:49.594 --> 02:45:02.182]  The Child Protective Services had removed the two little girls from their mother who was very young and they based it on the fact that there was an unopened can of beer in the front of her car.
[02:45:03.063 --> 02:45:06.325]  They took these two little girls over to an adjoining county
[02:45:06.792 --> 02:45:10.573]  Put them in foster home over there where they had 18 children.
[02:45:11.394 --> 02:45:15.215]  All kinds of little rooms downstairs in the lower level of this home.
[02:45:16.056 --> 02:45:20.457]  And one of the case workers in that county was a pedophile.
[02:45:21.057 --> 02:45:21.378]  Of course.
[02:45:21.438 --> 02:45:22.758]  Who lived in that home.
[02:45:23.799 --> 02:45:28.080]  And regularly sexually molested the children who were in the foster care.
[02:45:28.580 --> 02:45:28.760]  Ugh.
[02:45:29.821 --> 02:45:35.443]  When this came up in court, I went to court with this grandmother and sat in the back of the courtroom.
[02:45:36.278 --> 02:45:54.091]  And we had a good attorney that day who pulled the walls down, who cross-examined one of the older children in this foster home, and she admitted that there was an inappropriate relationship between the foster mother and the caseworker.
[02:45:55.112 --> 02:46:04.499]  And then it got a little worse, and then the juvenile court judge got all nervous and said, counsel, meet me in my chambers, and they went out and stayed five minutes and came back.
[02:46:04.975 --> 02:46:10.118]  And our attorney just looked at us, out loud, and said it's nothing but legal kidnapping.
[02:46:10.438 --> 02:46:12.239]  That's all it is, legal kidnapping.
[02:46:12.879 --> 02:46:14.200]  But let me tell you what happened.
[02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:15.341]  Did they get the child back?
[02:46:15.621 --> 02:46:21.664]  We pressed, it's called DFAX in Georgia, and we pressed and pressed and pressed.
[02:46:22.024 --> 02:46:25.366]  The judge said those children will be removed within a week.
[02:46:25.786 --> 02:46:29.308]  Well, a week was gone, ten days was gone, the children were still there.
[02:46:29.748 --> 02:46:32.530]  We kept leaning on them to get those children out of there.
[02:46:35.083 --> 02:46:46.245]  Out of the blue, someone called his grandmother in Florida to tell her that they were bringing the children from Georgia to the state line, which she'd drive up to pick them up.
[02:46:47.485 --> 02:46:49.126]  She, of course, said she would be there.
[02:46:49.806 --> 02:46:50.826]  She got the children.
[02:46:51.226 --> 02:46:52.766]  They didn't have any clothes.
[02:46:53.026 --> 02:46:54.447]  One was not wearing shoes.
[02:46:55.147 --> 02:47:01.188]  She took them home, and within three days, that juvenile court judge drew up a new order
[02:47:02.145 --> 02:47:12.870]  And she gave the two little girls to their father, who lived on the West Coast, who had never been involved in their lives, and who was involved in adult entertainment.
[02:47:14.371 --> 02:47:16.552]  I pulled his business up on the Internet.
[02:47:17.292 --> 02:47:18.153]  Pornographic.
[02:47:19.193 --> 02:47:19.554]  Awful.
[02:47:19.974 --> 02:47:21.234]  That's why they gave it to him.
[02:47:21.314 --> 02:47:23.896]  In fact, you come to the next point, Senator.
[02:47:24.016 --> 02:47:28.358]  Within three days, that father was knocking on the door of that grandmother,
[02:47:28.761 --> 02:47:32.058]  And took those two little girls screaming and crying to the West Coast.
[02:47:34.269 --> 02:47:38.111]  Well, it's better than that death pit down there in that house for those little kids.
[02:47:38.151 --> 02:47:42.253]  Now, for those who don't know, I found out about this because I walked into these pits.
[02:47:42.913 --> 02:47:46.355]  And I probably only saw that summer seven or eight of them, but I mean, they were all the same.
[02:47:48.556 --> 02:47:49.896]  And literally, they're hell pits.
[02:47:50.797 --> 02:47:53.918]  And Senator, you notice everything I've told you, you've seen the same thing.
[02:47:53.958 --> 02:47:56.999]  We've had the same, similar experience fighting this.
[02:47:57.480 --> 02:47:59.240]  And I just do it a little bit of the time.
[02:47:59.561 --> 02:48:02.302]  Frankly, I psychologically shy away from it because it's so...
[02:48:03.547 --> 02:48:07.849]  Well, it just makes me feel very aggressive.
[02:48:08.109 --> 02:48:14.952]  But the point is, is that when it comes right down to it, how many Homeland Security Deputy Directors of States have been caught with little kids?
[02:48:15.012 --> 02:48:18.053]  How many Senators and Congressmen, you know, with the pages?
[02:48:18.113 --> 02:48:23.296]  And how many DHS officials, you know, that want to stop child abuse, it turns out, are pedophiles?
[02:48:24.301 --> 02:48:26.382]  When you get down to it, you've got a couple groups.
[02:48:27.243 --> 02:48:34.547]  You've got children who were abused, who think that all parents are abusive and they're going to punish the family.
[02:48:34.767 --> 02:48:45.114]  Because I went to college with some people that were going to be social workers and you'd be out drinking beer and the girl would say, you know, I just can't wait to take kids from these bad parents because I was abused.
[02:48:45.394 --> 02:48:46.975]  So there's those, mentally ill people.
[02:48:47.515 --> 02:48:51.337]  Then there's pedophiles who want access to kids, and then there's scumbags that just want money.
[02:48:51.857 --> 02:49:01.641]  And I gotta say, that's basically what makes up CPS in my experience, and I think, from what I've seen, I'd probably say 30% of them are pedophiles.
[02:49:02.522 --> 02:49:07.824]  And the problem is, this crime rate, this crime spree, is just growing!
[02:49:09.405 --> 02:49:12.166]  So can you comment on that, and where is this going, how do we stop them?
[02:49:13.072 --> 02:49:17.375]  Well, I would say that there definitely are pedophiles in the system.
[02:49:17.415 --> 02:49:18.956]  There's no question about that.
[02:49:19.036 --> 02:49:23.238]  Because we know where there's children, there are pedophiles.
[02:49:24.059 --> 02:49:28.762]  They're in schools and they're in churches and they're everywhere where they can get their hands on children.
[02:49:29.062 --> 02:49:30.203]  So we know that that's true.
[02:49:30.883 --> 02:49:32.864]  And it's got to be brought to an end.
[02:49:32.924 --> 02:49:35.386]  It's got to be completely exposed for what it is.
[02:49:35.876 --> 02:49:40.718]  And in my opinion, it needs to completely be dissolved.
[02:49:40.978 --> 02:49:44.520]  I don't see any good left in Child Protective Services.
[02:49:45.220 --> 02:49:52.204]  As far as picking up a child that's being totally abused, the police could do that just as well as Child Protective Services.
[02:49:52.224 --> 02:49:54.045]  And then you have due process.
[02:49:54.565 --> 02:49:54.985]  Exactly.
[02:49:55.205 --> 02:49:57.206]  Take Texas.
[02:49:57.226 --> 02:49:58.847]  Did you hear about the Texas Youth Commission?
[02:50:00.510 --> 02:50:01.031]  I don't know.
[02:50:01.051 --> 02:50:02.292]  I mean, there's so many crimes.
[02:50:02.352 --> 02:50:03.673]  I'm not knocking you if you haven't.
[02:50:03.893 --> 02:50:07.696]  You're not talking about all those children in Texas that were picked up at one time.
[02:50:08.717 --> 02:50:08.937]  I know.
[02:50:08.957 --> 02:50:10.459]  That was what that Mormon said.
[02:50:10.519 --> 02:50:10.739]  Right.
[02:50:11.339 --> 02:50:28.514]  Did you hear about how the child jails and the child facilities had organized pornographic rings and like big rape parties for the children and the state police found out about it and then weren't allowed to stop it and now they forced the director out because he did the right thing?
[02:50:29.514 --> 02:50:34.156]  I have heard about that in other states, but I have not heard about what happened in Texas, no.
[02:50:34.236 --> 02:50:41.080]  Okay, well here in Texas it came out that every major facility was doing stuff that people wouldn't even believe.
[02:50:41.120 --> 02:50:42.340]  You can read it in the mainstream news.
[02:50:42.761 --> 02:50:46.843]  Now they used that to pass a law for more money for the agencies.
[02:50:47.063 --> 02:50:52.986]  I'm sure you heard about Florida where it turned out the directors were pedophiles and 3,000 kids were missing and all that.
[02:50:53.726 --> 02:50:54.367]  What did they get?
[02:50:54.447 --> 02:50:55.527]  More money, more power?
[02:50:55.768 --> 02:50:59.831]  The incredible thing is, the worse they get, the more money and power they get.
[02:51:01.192 --> 02:51:02.193]  It appears that way.
[02:51:02.973 --> 02:51:03.994]  It appears that way.
[02:51:05.035 --> 02:51:06.836]  But all of it is based on money.
[02:51:07.077 --> 02:51:08.998]  And that's where it's going to have to be cut off.
[02:51:09.879 --> 02:51:16.504]  The federal incentives have got to be cut off and be removed on a federal level in order to get this stopped.
[02:51:16.957 --> 02:51:20.040]  And that's where we go now in the closing minutes we have left in this interview, Senator.
[02:51:20.900 --> 02:51:25.784]  And again, we can only come in here and pray for you in this fight, and then politically going after you.
[02:51:26.565 --> 02:51:27.105]  Solutions.
[02:51:27.125 --> 02:51:28.787]  But before we hit that, I wanted to finish up.
[02:51:29.167 --> 02:51:33.070]  Specific orders for specific children that look a specific way?
[02:51:33.090 --> 02:51:35.352]  I mean, you're now saying you've discovered that?
[02:51:35.993 --> 02:51:36.633]  Right, right.
[02:51:36.973 --> 02:51:38.154]  We have discovered that.
[02:51:38.835 --> 02:51:42.578]  We haven't discovered it in every state, but we've discovered it in many states.
[02:51:42.718 --> 02:51:44.880]  And we have so many families calling.
[02:51:46.618 --> 02:51:48.319]  That are absolutely delirious.
[02:51:49.119 --> 02:51:50.559]  They are so desperate.
[02:51:50.740 --> 02:51:52.440]  They do not know where to turn.
[02:51:52.780 --> 02:51:55.962]  And actually, they have no place to turn for help.
[02:51:56.562 --> 02:52:03.164]  And of course, parents, the poorer the families are, those are the ones who are targeted.
[02:52:03.524 --> 02:52:07.886]  Because they don't have the wherewithal to fight the system or hire an attorney.
[02:52:08.586 --> 02:52:13.068]  And they are just caught up in it and many of them are because their children
[02:52:13.835 --> 02:52:19.038]  Our blue-eyed or blonde are exactly what someone wants and those families are targeted.
[02:52:19.518 --> 02:52:27.283]  So, it is just heartbreaking as to what is going on and what we've got to do in order to bring this to an end.
[02:52:27.303 --> 02:52:34.447]  Have you ever heard about what the former head FBI agent in Southern California discovered about the CPS even in the 80s?
[02:52:35.347 --> 02:52:40.150]  They have public auctions, closed auctions in Las Vegas with the kids on the block.
[02:52:41.924 --> 02:52:49.885]  Well, you know, we have some states now that put the children on the internet and you can just go through their pictures and choose the one you want.
[02:52:51.286 --> 02:52:54.826]  See how pure evil is just right out in the open now like it's no big deal?
[02:52:55.406 --> 02:53:11.049]  And then there are some children that even if you might like to, if a really good person who is really trying to help a child will choose that child, often times then they refuse to let these parents have the child.
[02:53:12.438 --> 02:53:23.687]  So if your motives are pure as the driven snow, and you're trying to really help get a child out of that system, and give them a new life, often times, they won't let the child go.
[02:53:23.767 --> 02:53:32.814]  No, they want client houses where they warehouse the kids, a lot of times locked up, and they can legally lock them up and stuff, in these little cages.
[02:53:33.255 --> 02:53:39.680]  They only want client foster parents that want to run the money in and put them on drugs, because that's shared with the local CPS.
[02:53:40.641 --> 02:53:41.381]  Right, right.
[02:53:42.739 --> 02:53:47.721]  It is one of the most corrupt situations that we could ever have in this country.
[02:53:48.241 --> 02:53:53.343]  Yeah, well what we need is to take the country back, have mass trials, and hang about 10,000 of these people high.
[02:53:53.883 --> 02:53:55.364]  Because this rivals the Nazis.
[02:53:55.404 --> 02:53:57.065]  By the way, the Nazis had CPS.
[02:53:57.105 --> 02:54:00.866]  That's how they started, grabbing people's kids, the year Hitler was elected in 1933.
[02:54:01.146 --> 02:54:02.247]  He was a eugenicist.
[02:54:02.987 --> 02:54:04.207]  We'll be right back with the Senator.
[02:54:04.227 --> 02:54:04.748]  Stay with us.
[02:54:04.828 --> 02:54:05.468]  Final segment.
[02:54:05.968 --> 02:54:10.251]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:54:10.492 --> 02:54:15.395]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:54:15.595 --> 02:54:16.936]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:54:17.097 --> 02:54:20.599]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[02:54:20.719 --> 02:54:25.883]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[02:54:26.124 --> 02:54:31.888]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[02:54:32.228 --> 02:54:34.670]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[02:54:34.731 --> 02:54:37.053]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.

[02:54:39.695 --> 02:54:40.676]  No harsh chemicals.
[02:54:40.896 --> 02:54:41.837]  No animal testing.
[02:54:42.077 --> 02:54:43.399]  I use them and love them.
[02:54:43.419 --> 02:54:45.020]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:54:45.300 --> 02:54:46.401]  And I save big time.
[02:54:46.722 --> 02:54:47.943]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:54:47.963 --> 02:54:48.203]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[02:55:06.275 --> 02:55:11.517]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:55:12.316 --> 02:55:17.680]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:55:18.200 --> 02:55:24.384]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:55:24.704 --> 02:55:26.505]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:55:26.665 --> 02:55:29.047]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:55:29.127 --> 02:55:40.014]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:55:42.299 --> 02:55:43.580]  It's not about left or right.
[02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:45.341]  It's about a one world government.
[02:55:45.821 --> 02:55:52.185]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:55:52.745 --> 02:56:00.529]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:56:01.010 --> 02:56:02.170]  The Obama Deception.
[02:56:02.571 --> 02:56:03.831]  The people strike back.
[02:56:05.913 --> 02:56:08.754]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.

[02:57:22.162 --> 02:57:36.188]  You know, the Senator probably had a million more things she could have told you, but I was interrupting the whole time, but it's because I'm trying to relay and back up everything she's saying, that it's so horrible that even when I think about it, and I've been studying it for 14 years, I can't believe it.
[02:57:38.009 --> 02:57:45.853]  And, I mean, you'll be facing down one of these CPS workers, and man, you're like, I mean, these are demonic, soft, goblin-like creatures.
[02:57:45.873 --> 02:57:47.694]  I mean, they're art types.
[02:57:48.817 --> 02:57:53.165]  Because, I mean, how could somebody go around stealing kids all day outside the law and see in horror?
[02:57:53.205 --> 02:57:54.026]  They enjoy it.
[02:57:55.669 --> 02:57:57.031]  They... They're evil.
[02:57:57.091 --> 02:57:58.073]  They enjoy the pain.
[02:57:58.113 --> 02:57:58.514]  I'm gonna ask...
[02:57:59.554 --> 02:58:04.158]  Senator about some solutions, maybe have her back on to go over some more of those, how to fight these people, how to expose them.
[02:58:04.438 --> 02:58:06.519]  I gotta tell you about two sponsors before we go back to her.
[02:58:07.460 --> 02:58:08.521]  One of them is HomeGain.
[02:58:08.541 --> 02:58:12.204]  You can check out Max's little orange gorilla at Infowars.com.
[02:58:13.084 --> 02:58:18.428]  They have a home sale maximizer to help you determine which home improvements can most increase your home's value before you put it on the market.
[02:58:18.849 --> 02:58:19.629]  It's absolutely free.
[02:58:19.649 --> 02:58:20.450]  Just enter your home address.
[02:58:20.470 --> 02:58:21.150]  They have a lot of great
[02:58:22.071 --> 02:58:24.873]  Mortgage companies and other stuff you can contact through their site.
[02:58:24.893 --> 02:58:25.753]  It's just a great portal.
[02:58:26.074 --> 02:58:26.674]  It's all free.
[02:58:26.774 --> 02:58:27.254]  Realtors.
[02:58:27.735 --> 02:58:30.997]  Homegain, H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[02:58:31.037 --> 02:58:32.177]  Homegain dot com.

[02:58:33.478 --> 02:58:34.559]  And Survival Seed Bank.
[02:58:35.179 --> 02:58:41.343]  In a real crisis, folks, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[02:58:41.383 --> 02:58:46.606]  And you heard earlier from the London Guardian reporter, they're now restricting buying seeds in Europe and England.
[02:58:46.626 --> 02:58:47.507]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:58:48.007 --> 02:58:53.433]  You can check them out at SurvivalSeedBank.com, heirloom, non-GMO seeds, super high quality, great price.

[02:58:56.636 --> 02:58:57.437]  Okay, Senator, what are...
[02:59:04.204 --> 02:59:06.285]  What are solutions to fight these demons?
[02:59:06.305 --> 02:59:21.670]  I mean, we just get the public educated what we're doing now about their rights, get bigger organizations together to fight them, Congress, state laws, because we always push to get state laws to stop them, and they always take it over and get more power out of us trying to lobby to reform.
[02:59:21.730 --> 02:59:23.190]  How do we beat pure evil?
[02:59:24.011 --> 02:59:31.333]  Very, very strong bill that I introduced to correct it here in the state of Georgia, and of course that bill was defeated.
[02:59:32.374 --> 02:59:38.496]  I also had several parents lined up to come down and do a video, and the video was defeated.
[02:59:39.076 --> 02:59:40.977]  And then, of course, I lost my Senate seat.
[02:59:41.037 --> 02:59:48.280]  So there's a huge battle over this, and many states don't want to let that money go that they've gotten used to.
[02:59:48.300 --> 02:59:55.202]  And one thing we haven't mentioned that I'd like to bring out is how huge the bureaucracy is.
[02:59:55.462 --> 02:59:59.784]  It is made up of caseworkers and social workers and
[03:00:01.506 --> 03:00:09.610]  uh... attorneys and guardian ad litem and judges and uh... psychiatrist and psychologist and it goes on and on.
[03:00:09.670 --> 03:00:20.575]  The bureaucracy is huge made up of people who look to the children in child protective services for their job security.
[03:00:22.676 --> 03:00:25.878]  And none of these people want to let this be brought to an end.
[03:00:26.318 --> 03:00:28.099]  This is where they get their paycheck.
[03:00:28.769 --> 03:00:31.250]  And it's not being brought to an end, it's radically expanding.
[03:00:31.690 --> 03:00:39.914]  Absolutely it is, and they're expanding with it, and we can see the children that are already being sent into mental health facilities.
[03:00:39.934 --> 03:00:49.899]  I had a mother that two children were put in mental health facilities, and of course that brings in Medicaid, and these two children were on 16 drugs a day.
[03:00:51.388 --> 03:00:57.275]  So it is corrupt to its absolute core and we must stand against it.
[03:00:57.315 --> 03:00:58.737]  We must keep talking about it.
[03:00:59.078 --> 03:01:02.502]  And families that are listening to us today that are caught up in this,
[03:01:03.439 --> 03:01:05.881]  They need to continue to fight the system.
[03:01:05.901 --> 03:01:07.802]  Continue to fight... Okay, Senator, I've got to stop you.
[03:01:07.882 --> 03:01:09.123]  We've got 45 seconds.
[03:01:09.143 --> 03:01:13.085]  What about websites, or how do folks get a copy of your bill to get it passed in their state?
[03:01:13.326 --> 03:01:17.088]  I've got to have you back for more solutions, but contact info groups you recommend.
[03:01:17.868 --> 03:01:20.530]  Are there just welcome groups that they can recommend?
[03:01:20.570 --> 03:01:26.034]  Or they can contact me at Eagle Farm of Georgia.
[03:01:27.281 --> 03:01:32.745]  Just Google Eagle Forum of Georgia or there's also the Senator Nancy Schaefer website as well.
[03:01:32.805 --> 03:01:34.787]  Nancy Schaefer, we want to have you back up.
[03:01:34.867 --> 03:01:35.587]  God bless you.
[03:01:35.847 --> 03:01:39.110]  You're a true angel and we appreciate your courage.
[03:01:39.150 --> 03:01:41.231]  I know it's hard to do what you do because it's so hard.
[03:01:41.511 --> 03:01:42.232]  God bless you.
[03:01:43.633 --> 03:01:44.293]  Thank you, Senator.
[03:01:44.594 --> 03:01:45.755]  Our retransmission starts now.

[03:01:55.680 --> 03:01:57.262]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:01:57.362 --> 03:02:02.028]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:02:02.108 --> 03:02:04.871]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:02:05.071 --> 03:02:07.955]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:02:08.115 --> 03:02:12.841]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:02:13.061 --> 03:02:14.002]  If you simply prepare.
[03:02:14.182 --> 03:02:17.144]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:02:17.424 --> 03:02:24.330]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
