[00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:22.629]  We are now simulcasting the live radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:23.350]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.974]  The Obama Deception is now here in DVD and shipping out to everybody that's gotten it.
[00:00:28.074 --> 00:00:31.176]  Get your copy at InfoWars.com.
[00:00:32.537 --> 00:00:42.426]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls and coming up in the next 10-15 minutes of the first hour, I'll be simulcasting with Judge Andrew Napolitano's radio slash TV show, so that is coming up.
[00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:46.069]  Right now, let's go to Roland in Mass.
[00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:47.530]  Roland, you're on the air.
[00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.991]  Yes, sir.
[00:00:49.191 --> 00:00:51.373]  Alex, it's a great pleasure and honor to be with you.
[00:00:53.055 --> 00:00:53.795]  Let's see here.
[00:00:53.815 --> 00:00:55.117]  I had a couple quick questions.
[00:00:55.957 --> 00:01:04.606]  One of the members of our group that we organize here is talking about Peter Schiff and the Schiff family being funders of the Bolshevik Revolution.
[00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.692]  I mean, yeah, there's probably tens of thousands of shifts in the United States.
[00:01:10.752 --> 00:01:13.774]  That's like saying, am I related to John Paul Jones?
[00:01:13.814 --> 00:01:19.076]  I don't believe I am the first Navy admiral in the Revolutionary War.
[00:01:19.276 --> 00:01:21.537]  Or am I related to Jim Jones?
[00:01:21.577 --> 00:01:22.538]  The answer is no.
[00:01:22.938 --> 00:01:26.980]  But am I guilty because of something Jim Jones has done somewhere back in Wales?
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.521]  Did I have somebody related to Jim Jones?
[00:01:29.621 --> 00:01:32.023]  Probably 50th Cousins or 100th Cousins.
[00:01:32.043 --> 00:01:32.283]  I don't know.
[00:01:32.323 --> 00:01:34.444]  I'm probably related to John Paul Jones as well.
[00:01:34.464 --> 00:01:43.370]  I'm probably related to James Jones, one of the heads of Homeland Security, setting up the police state of the National Security Council.
[00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:51.415]  But no, Erwin Schiff, the father of Peter Schiff, is in prison for exposing the private Federal Reserve.
[00:01:51.615 --> 00:01:55.338]  Anybody who's prominent fighting the New World Order gets attacked by the government and the media.
[00:01:56.178 --> 00:02:01.561]  They also get attacked just by crazies that are jealous of anybody who has any success on the internet.
[00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:03.422]  They just make up new things constantly.
[00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:04.942]  That's what I thought.
[00:02:05.603 --> 00:02:10.665]  As far as my own research goes, everything Peter has ever said seems pretty consistent.
[00:02:10.685 --> 00:02:12.906]  He's giving financial news, take it or leave it.
[00:02:13.206 --> 00:02:15.127]  He's just another person out there talking.
[00:02:16.668 --> 00:02:19.652]  I mean, it's all this obsession about who's talking about the New World Order.
[00:02:20.012 --> 00:02:21.614]  They're openly setting up world government.
[00:02:21.634 --> 00:02:22.915]  It's all over the newspapers.
[00:02:23.436 --> 00:02:26.619]  And most of our movement spends their time just attacking everybody else.
[00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:28.481]  And it's jealousy.
[00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:28.922]  It's envy.
[00:02:28.962 --> 00:02:30.243]  I'd love to say they were government agents.
[00:02:30.523 --> 00:02:31.404]  They're not government agents.
[00:02:31.444 --> 00:02:32.305]  I appreciate your call.
[00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:34.608]  I mean, that's not what this show is about.
[00:02:35.068 --> 00:02:36.129]  Is this guy good?
[00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.090]  Or is that guy good?
[00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.071]  Or is this lady good?
[00:02:39.153 --> 00:02:41.814]  We're just here covering the news and information.
[00:02:41.834 --> 00:02:52.557]  You know, I told you last week that they had Marines, Army, excuse me, out running around with checkpoints after the Alabama shooting and we called up and had the colonel on who was there and he admitted they were and now it's in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:02:54.818 --> 00:02:57.920]  Reviews troop use at fatal Alabama shootings.
[00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:04.225]  Here's CNS News, Army investigating how and why troops were sent into Alabama town after murder spree.
[00:03:04.245 --> 00:03:09.629]  And they have the Army here saying it looks like it's illegal what they did, carrying out law enforcement activities.
[00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:16.895]  The colonel said it wasn't law enforcement activities, but it clearly was controlling cordon and running checkpoints, running roadblocks.
[00:03:18.496 --> 00:03:25.981]  The military's trying to get rid of Posse Comintonis right now, but it's kind of interesting that they've announced they're going to put 20,000 regular troops on the streets.
[00:03:26.702 --> 00:03:28.463]  But now they're saying these guys may be in trouble.
[00:03:28.503 --> 00:03:33.467]  It looks like they're in trouble because they exceeded their orders and were out here doing this on their own.
[00:03:33.987 --> 00:03:35.808]  And I don't think they should get in trouble for this.
[00:03:35.868 --> 00:03:42.033]  They just need to say they're not going to do it again because they've been told by the brass we're going to start policing America.
[00:03:42.493 --> 00:03:45.355]  That's been in the news, been in the Army Times, and so then
[00:03:46.616 --> 00:03:51.521]  There's a shooting, they try to show up to help thinking this is their orders, and now they may get in trouble.
[00:03:52.281 --> 00:04:01.510]  You know, it's because the illusion of that order has been given, and they see troops at the Super Bowl and troops on the TV in New York, so they think this is normal.
[00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.952]  Now they're learning their lesson, this is a federal crime.
[00:04:04.312 --> 00:04:06.074]  This is a violation of federal law.
[00:04:07.876 --> 00:04:08.696]  I appreciate...
[00:04:11.206 --> 00:04:11.927]  Everybody's call.
[00:04:11.987 --> 00:04:20.314]  We've got to go to break here and start the next hour, already into the third hour today, simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:20.334 --> 00:04:27.319]  When we come back for stations out there, I'm just throwing it to Andrew Napolitano, Judge Napolitano's show, until he comes to me.
[00:04:27.359 --> 00:04:27.820]  Stay with us.
[00:04:30.242 --> 00:04:35.186]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:04:35.206 --> 00:04:37.348]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:40.871]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:45.638]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:04:45.738 --> 00:04:48.502]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:04:48.702 --> 00:04:51.586]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:04:51.766 --> 00:04:56.473]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:04:56.633 --> 00:04:56.913]  We're good.
[00:05:12.315 --> 00:05:12.955]  We're good to go.
[00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:44.066]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:05:44.526 --> 00:05:47.387]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:54.449]  Big Brother.
[00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.170]  Mainstream media.
[00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:57.991]  Government cover-ups.
[00:05:58.631 --> 00:05:59.451]  You want answers?
[00:06:00.211 --> 00:06:01.132]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:05.453]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:05.953 --> 00:06:10.015]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.004]  Okay, we're gonna be simulcasting here in just a minute or so with Andrew Napolitano's show, Judge Napolitano.
[00:06:21.065 --> 00:06:25.828]  I'm gonna go ahead and throw up the Fox audio right now from their show and wait till he goes to me.
[00:06:25.848 --> 00:06:27.710]  I'm gonna let him run the show here.
[00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:28.050]  Here we go.
[00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.371]  Okay, well we're waiting for my guys to send me that.
[00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:41.433]  I'm not going to it for about ten minutes.
[00:06:41.633 --> 00:06:42.113]  Okay, great.
[00:06:42.133 --> 00:06:43.074]  We've got audio now.
[00:06:43.094 --> 00:06:44.795]  I'm just going to wait for Fox.
[00:06:44.835 --> 00:06:50.438]  Fox, I'm here and I'm just running the judges show right now as you guys get ready to go live there as well.
[00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:52.860]  My face is at an angle.
[00:06:59.308 --> 00:07:03.093]  Hey, change the aspect ratio, please, on your remote.
[00:07:03.914 --> 00:07:04.915]  This is a rare treat.
[00:07:06.777 --> 00:07:08.519]  He looks a little squeezed.
[00:07:18.342 --> 00:07:22.925]  That's pretty good though, considering Skype, my God, it's excellent.
[00:07:22.945 --> 00:07:26.828]  It's a lot better than those things Carl Cameron did from the car during the campaign.
[00:07:26.848 --> 00:07:30.470]  Yeah, that's different technology.
[00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:30.650]  Hello?
[00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.852]  I suppose one day you'll give us Skypes on our desks?
[00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:36.134]  No, we're not allowed to have it internally.
[00:07:36.814 --> 00:07:37.375]  Well, that stinks.
[00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:37.875]  Hello, Alex.
[00:07:38.355 --> 00:07:40.457]  I can understand it though, they want us in a studio, yeah.
[00:07:40.477 --> 00:07:41.157]  This is a security risk.
[00:07:41.237 --> 00:07:42.898]  Understood, understood, and I respect that.
[00:07:42.938 --> 00:07:43.519]  Hello, Alex.
[00:07:45.293 --> 00:07:46.414]  I'm here guys, I'm waiting.
[00:07:46.854 --> 00:07:50.256]  Okay, we're going to put in a program and the judge will bring you in, okay?
[00:07:50.496 --> 00:07:57.039]  Okay, yeah, you're sending me your regular audio feed over, just so you know, but I can hear you, I'm ready, when they go to me, I'm here.
[00:07:57.059 --> 00:07:58.140]  I wonder if they could do it.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:04.123]  Hey guys, can you... Joel, Uma... Andy will be with you shortly.
[00:08:04.783 --> 00:08:05.783]  Okay, I'm here, thank you.
[00:08:06.624 --> 00:08:07.804]  Andy will be with you shortly.
[00:08:17.551 --> 00:08:18.555]  Great human being.
[00:08:18.575 --> 00:08:21.324]  Great human being.
[00:08:46.588 --> 00:08:48.850]  It's 2 o'clock in the East Coast in New York City.
[00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:49.910]  It's 11 o'clock in the morning.
[00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.232]  It's 2 o'clock in the East Coast in New York City.
[00:08:52.272 --> 00:08:53.753]  It's 11 o'clock in the morning.
[00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:56.874]  It's free to watch on foxnews.com as part of our Strategy Room production.
[00:08:57.555 --> 00:09:05.760]  In this show, we talk about what the government has done to take your liberty and your property away and how we can be aware of it and prevent it from happening in the future.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.982]  And I am so happy because we're doing something different right now.
[00:09:09.422 --> 00:09:15.486]  We are simulcasting with the one, the only, the great Alex Jones on Alex Jones Radio.
[00:09:17.518 --> 00:09:21.460]  Alex, as you welcome me to Alex Jones Radio, I welcome you to Freedom Watch.
[00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:24.262]  Well, Judge, I'm going to let you run the show.
[00:09:24.342 --> 00:09:27.284]  I'm just here to be interviewed by you, and I appreciate you having me on.
[00:09:27.304 --> 00:09:28.424]  We'll get it taken care of.
[00:09:28.444 --> 00:09:34.488]  Can you hear us, Alex?
[00:09:34.828 --> 00:09:36.749]  Yes, we're doing something experimental here.
[00:09:36.809 --> 00:09:38.050]  Yes, Houston.
[00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.631]  Cape Canaveral hears you.
[00:09:40.311 --> 00:09:42.252]  Okay, New York hears you loud and clear.
[00:09:42.292 --> 00:09:43.553]  Welcome to Freedom Watch, Alex.
[00:09:43.573 --> 00:09:44.914]  What are you talking about today?
[00:09:45.897 --> 00:09:57.932]  Oh, of just how hundreds of mainstream news articles a week are saying there is a new world order, a global government, it will be run by the very banks that are collapsing society by design, and we will pay carbon taxes to them.
[00:09:58.293 --> 00:10:04.040]  Here is Time Magazine headlined, New World Order, and they say a new bank of the world will rule the United States.
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:09.742]  Here is the Financial Times of London and now for a world government is the headline.
[00:10:09.762 --> 00:10:32.812]  They're openly announcing that the banks will rule the planet and will pay our carbon taxes to them for the phony global warming and I just had a state rep on confirming the modern militia movement document, MYAC, saying Ron Paul supporters, libertarians, anybody with a Ron Paul bumper sticker are dangerous terrorists, that the North American Union doesn't exist, that anybody that talks about freedom or liberty issues
[00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:37.396]  He's basically an evil terrorist, so we're exposing the New World Order here, Judge.
[00:10:37.516 --> 00:10:44.903]  Well, I appreciate what you're exposing, and Ron Paul, whom you just mentioned, will be on Freedom Watch with me in about 20 minutes.
[00:10:45.604 --> 00:10:53.071]  I must tell you that there was a time when the types of things that you are warning against was not discussed openly and publicly.
[00:10:53.471 --> 00:10:58.796]  But I was scandalized when British Prime Minister Gordon Brown tipped his hand
[00:10:59.508 --> 00:11:14.372]  When he spoke to a joint session of Congress two weeks ago and said he was looking for, these are the words that cost me a couple of sleepless nights, Alex, and I bet you as well and many of the folks watching and listening to us, a global new deal.
[00:11:14.912 --> 00:11:22.354]  Now what under the sun is a global new deal unless it consists of the type of thing that you have just warned against?
[00:11:22.779 --> 00:11:23.159]  We're good to go.
[00:11:36.272 --> 00:11:36.852]  Absolutely.
[00:11:36.913 --> 00:11:38.954]  Here is yesterday's London Telegraph.
[00:11:39.174 --> 00:11:56.826]  IMS poised to print billions of dollars in global easing and it says that the International Monetary Fund will create a new global super currency that will replace the dollar and that Americans will pay tax money in to fund the world government.
[00:11:56.907 --> 00:11:59.468]  So this is all out in the open.
[00:11:59.708 --> 00:11:59.989]  That's why
[00:12:00.529 --> 00:12:02.870]  On our news, Geithner will never say what the plan is.
[00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:03.490]  What are you going to do?
[00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:04.311]  How are you going to fix it?
[00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:13.295]  But when the G20 meet, when they have the Bretton Woods meeting, the new one coming up in a few days, they admit they're setting up a world government run by private banks.
[00:12:13.355 --> 00:12:15.696]  What the Trilateral Commission said back in the 70s.
[00:12:15.736 --> 00:12:16.417]  Listen, I never...
[00:12:16.897 --> 00:12:16.977]  Yes.
[00:12:47.457 --> 00:12:53.740]  Let me raise your blood pressure a little bit more, Alex, because this also what I'm now about to discuss with you raised my blood pressure.
[00:12:54.581 --> 00:13:10.949]  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited her counterpart in Beijing about eight or nine days ago, and I don't know who else she saw, but we saw pictures of her with the Chinese foreign minister about four days after that at the G20 summit to which you just referred.
[00:13:11.514 --> 00:13:20.800]  A meeting of the finance ministers of the 20 largest countries in the world, which control collectively about 85% of the economy.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.142]  For some reason, the Chinese premier was there.
[00:13:24.383 --> 00:13:28.345]  He was the only head of state there, other than Gordon Brown as the host.
[00:13:28.886 --> 00:13:38.632]  And the Chinese premier, before the G20 started, gave an interview to one of the international press and said he seriously worried
[00:13:39.275 --> 00:13:42.939]  About whether the United States will be able to meet its obligations.
[00:13:43.059 --> 00:13:43.319]  Yes.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:51.228]  Calculated that the Chinese government itself, or government supported enterprises, supported by the Chinese government.
[00:13:51.667 --> 00:13:52.388]  I think so.
[00:14:09.704 --> 00:14:16.908]  Well, we know in separate meetings she's had with the Chinese leadership in several trips in Europe and in China, she said, please keep buying the dollar.
[00:14:16.988 --> 00:14:18.989]  Please keep buying our debt.
[00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.872]  Just long enough for us to set up this new global monetary system.
[00:14:23.152 --> 00:14:25.813]  The Russians are calling for a new global currency.
[00:14:26.193 --> 00:14:28.915]  The only thing the US has left is its fiat dollar.
[00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:30.096]  The globalists have debased
[00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:31.479]  Our nation.
[00:14:31.739 --> 00:14:33.000]  They've made us a debtor nation.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.521]  They've destroyed our capacity to manufacture.
[00:14:36.841 --> 00:14:40.102]  And so the globalists are creating a global fire sale.
[00:14:40.122 --> 00:14:53.347]  They're destroying the world economy in their own documents so that then they'll be the only lender to the planet and they'll create more fiat currency backed by US and European taxpayers to then fund setting up their world government.
[00:14:53.367 --> 00:14:55.928]  So absolutely the Chinese have been bad-mouthing the US.
[00:14:56.388 --> 00:15:01.850]  Now, they've been bad-mouthing the country that they own over a trillion dollars of our T-bills in.
[00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:13.274]  This is the birth of the New World Order, and so you've got all these different honchos from the private central banks, the private Federal Reserve, and others, all meeting, deciding on the final architecture of the world government.
[00:15:13.294 --> 00:15:19.556]  The very banks that have engineered the economic collapse are now posing as our saviors, bringing this in.
[00:15:19.636 --> 00:15:20.697]  But the good news is,
[00:15:21.497 --> 00:15:23.258]  I've never seen an awakening this big.
[00:15:23.478 --> 00:15:26.499]  And I'm seeing, you know, people like Glenn Beck talk about the New World Order on Fox.
[00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:28.899]  I'm seeing you talk about it for years before him.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.860]  We're seeing Lou Dobbs talk about it.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:35.742]  We're seeing, you know, mainline talk show host Limbaugh's even talking about global government now.
[00:15:36.002 --> 00:15:41.364]  Michael Savage is talking about how he thinks, you know, Obama may stage crises to bring in martial law.
[00:15:41.704 --> 00:15:48.306]  So all the things that I was talking about in the wilderness ten plus years ago is now hitting mainstream.
[00:15:48.846 --> 00:15:54.127]  And it is great, so it shows me the sleeping giant that is the United States and all of this liberty and freedom.
[00:15:54.147 --> 00:15:57.988]  We're rediscovering our roots, our Declaration of Independence, our Constitution.
[00:15:58.328 --> 00:16:03.109]  You called for states to not secede, but, you know, re-declare their Tenth Amendment, Ninth Amendment.
[00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:08.570]  You're a judge, you know the Constitution well, constitutional scholar, and so they're trying to get the feds back in line.
[00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:15.252]  The battle lines are being drawn here, and the American people are finding out that Washington's been seized by offshore banks.
[00:16:16.479 --> 00:16:21.142]  Well, this will make your blood boil a little bit more as we keep ratcheting this up.
[00:16:21.362 --> 00:16:24.083]  And I thought that the summary you just gave was terrific.
[00:16:24.544 --> 00:16:33.949]  And just for those of us that are tuning in, Judge Napolitano simulcasting from Freedom Watch at FoxNews.com with Alex Jones, the great Alex Jones on the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[00:16:34.289 --> 00:16:35.630]  We only have another minute or so.
[00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:43.915]  I suspect that Mrs. Clinton and the President will begin saying nice things about the Chinese human rights record.
[00:16:44.335 --> 00:16:45.055]  No, no, they are now.
[00:16:45.315 --> 00:16:48.116]  They are, and that's why we've made the Obama deception.
[00:16:48.717 --> 00:17:00.741]  Because if we dare to criticize, if we dare to use our First Amendment rights against one of the most oppressive giants in the world, they might just stop loaning us money, Alex.
[00:17:01.121 --> 00:17:01.681]  What would we do?
[00:17:03.035 --> 00:17:05.616]  Well, things would basically collapse, and that's what the globalists want.
[00:17:05.656 --> 00:17:15.999]  We're all interconnected and controlled, and that's what my new film, The Obama Deception, at InfoWars.com covers, is how this guy is controlled by the very banks that did the bailout.
[00:17:16.059 --> 00:17:17.080]  Geithner helped write it.
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:23.742]  He's claiming he's going after all these CEOs' bonuses when they wrote a loophole in there where they're all exempt
[00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:24.843]  We're good.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:50.284]  What his agenda is to bankrupt this country and bring in total police state control.
[00:17:50.324 --> 00:17:52.506]  But again, the good news is, the people are waking up.
[00:17:52.546 --> 00:17:55.389]  And by the way, the Obama Deception is free on YouTube and Google.
[00:17:55.429 --> 00:17:57.611]  Folks, don't have to get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:17:57.851 --> 00:18:03.376]  The Obama Deception, the most hard-hitting film, shattering the left-right paradigm, blowing the New World Order apart.
[00:18:03.676 --> 00:18:09.441]  Judge Napolitano, I want to thank you so much for having this simulcast, and I want to invite you on my show anytime, my friend.
[00:18:10.509 --> 00:18:11.390]  Same from me to thee.
[00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:12.291]  Thanks, Alex Jones.
[00:18:12.371 --> 00:18:13.631]  It's absolutely been a pleasure.
[00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:15.493]  Thank you.
[00:18:15.593 --> 00:18:19.835]  First time with our experimentation with simulcasting two shows.
[00:18:19.876 --> 00:18:24.559]  But before we get to our guests here in Freedom Watch who have joined us and are ready to weigh in.
[00:18:24.619 --> 00:18:34.165]  Thomas Jefferson wedded the natural law to American law in the Declaration of Independence when he wrote that our rights are inalienable and come to us from our Creator.
[00:18:34.665 --> 00:18:36.887]  Not only does federal law... Alright, thank you, Fox.
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.101]  You guys are getting radical having me on over there.
[00:18:41.481 --> 00:18:42.541]  Let's go ahead and disconnect him.
[00:18:42.561 --> 00:18:43.502]  Thank you, guys.
[00:18:45.802 --> 00:18:47.263]  Alright, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:47.303 --> 00:18:52.204]  That was the simulcast with Judge Napolitano for about 12 minutes.
[00:18:54.845 --> 00:18:56.106]  I said I was going to air this.
[00:18:56.286 --> 00:18:56.846]  I'm going to air it.
[00:18:56.866 --> 00:19:00.567]  Then we're going to come back and take calls with everybody that's patiently holding.
[00:19:01.287 --> 00:19:02.888]  Got a nice plug-in for the Obama deception.
[00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:16.052]  I always told you folks that we would just plant the seeds, tell people the New World Order plan, tell them how the banks were going to implode things, exactly how it would happen, and then when it did happen, people could laugh at me.
[00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:29.216]  I mean, I've had people laugh at me, talk show hosts attack me, I've been booed, you know, when the Obamanoids attacked our bullhorn and cut it with a knife in Denver, they laughed with pleasure as I walked away to go get another bullhorn, and I didn't feel bad.
[00:19:29.536 --> 00:19:34.238]  It felt good to be laughed at, it felt good to be pilloried, it felt good to be attacked, because I knew I was right.
[00:19:35.098 --> 00:19:36.701]  And it's about being right.
[00:19:36.721 --> 00:19:39.186]  It's about standing up for what's good, what's decent, what's honorable.
[00:19:39.486 --> 00:19:41.570]  That's all that matters at the end of the day.
[00:19:43.706 --> 00:20:05.059]  Is that my family name be defended, that I be a good person, that when my great-great-grandchildren see a picture of me on the wall, you know, when they're out there orbiting the planet on a space station or terraforming Mars or living right here in Texas, you know, wherever they are in the future, that they respect and remember me and then use me as an example of being strong men and women and standing up for goodness and humanity and honorable things.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:10.263]  And so they believe in their humanity and believe in the change that they can make in the world for good.
[00:20:11.738 --> 00:20:25.229]  Just like I look back at my forbearers, you know, who were at the Battle of San Jacinto, and my forbearers who raised Colonel Travis's son when he went to the Alamo, and my forbearers that came over on the Mayflower, and my forbearers who were Native Americans and great, upstanding, amazing people.
[00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:39.982]  And I look at that, and I don't want to short sell, you know, my lineage, who I am as a human being, and all of us are special, all of us had just amazing people that busted their hind ends and fought and died in many cases, so we'd have a little bit of dignity and freedom.
[00:20:41.516 --> 00:20:44.980]  Now, I promised to play this conversation with Sergeant Joe Clark of MIAC.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.281]  We are not terrorists.
[00:20:47.763 --> 00:20:49.485]  And here is that YouTube.
[00:20:49.525 --> 00:20:50.747]  Great reporters did this report.
[00:20:50.767 --> 00:20:54.050]  So I'm going to go ahead and play this report here video-wise.
[00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:55.312]  In fact, I forgot to give this to you.
[00:20:55.352 --> 00:20:58.255]  The network has the audio of this.
[00:20:59.278 --> 00:21:08.385]  But instead of the network, since we're simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv, I'm still getting used to this, will you guys come get this, YouTube it, pull it up, that way folks can also see the fine reporters that did this.
[00:21:08.706 --> 00:21:11.028]  You know, we didn't call up and tape the state police.
[00:21:11.708 --> 00:21:15.251]  And we gave you their names and phone numbers when we put out the Mike report, and people still denied it.
[00:21:15.631 --> 00:21:20.575]  And we had a state rep on last hour documenting that he indeed
[00:21:22.138 --> 00:21:27.802]  Call the state police, has the head of the state police coming over to his office next week when the legislature is back in session.
[00:21:27.822 --> 00:21:30.024]  So you heard Jim Guest, Representative, tell you it's real.
[00:21:30.344 --> 00:21:36.809]  But I thought I'd play this tape as well, going into break and then coming out of break about a minute or so of it will be left.
[00:21:38.689 --> 00:21:52.937]  Again, what's happened here is we laid out, no matter how much we got laughed at, no matter how many times I got fired, no matter how many stations we lost, no matter, you know, how much monetary damage it caused to my small operation, I never wavered.
[00:21:53.797 --> 00:22:05.364]  And I remember I saw other people, and I'm not bashing them, started a Ron Paul network, a little Ron Paul thing during that, and they said, oh, no New World Order, no 9-11 truth, none of this, because this is how we're going to be big, and this is how we're going to have a huge success.
[00:22:05.424 --> 00:22:07.065]  And I remember saying, you know,
[00:22:08.368 --> 00:22:11.450]  Imagine if you were offered real power, how fast you would sell out.
[00:22:12.871 --> 00:22:22.418]  Imagine if you were offered real power, like I have been, millions of dollars a year, power, real power, all over the country, on hundreds and hundreds of AM and FM's, and I've turned it down repeatedly.
[00:22:23.433 --> 00:22:28.096]  And I haven't seen many other people who will turn down hard, cold cash.
[00:22:28.937 --> 00:22:31.618]  I haven't seen other people that will turn down hard, cold fame.
[00:22:32.539 --> 00:22:33.479]  And I don't understand that.
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:42.285]  Who I am, being accurate, being honest, telling it like it is, and doing it my way, is numero uno.
[00:22:43.566 --> 00:22:44.006]  Period.
[00:22:44.907 --> 00:22:46.708]  And that's why I do what I do.
[00:22:46.828 --> 00:22:48.369]  And I'm not bashing people
[00:22:49.966 --> 00:22:56.855]  I mean, they started several, Ron Paul, you know, little radio networks I've seen in the last year that went the way of the Goonie Bird because it was controlled.
[00:22:56.935 --> 00:22:57.596]  It was censored.
[00:22:59.098 --> 00:23:00.539]  We don't do that here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:05.005]  I tell it like it is, and I tell it as the best of my ability to understand it.
[00:23:05.025 --> 00:23:05.846]  Does that mean I'm perfect?
[00:23:06.067 --> 00:23:07.248]  No, we all see through.
[00:23:08.209 --> 00:23:09.210]  A rose colored darkly.
[00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.712]  We all see the world distorted from what it really is.
[00:23:12.172 --> 00:23:16.736]  But I've always tried to train myself to extricate myself from emotion.
[00:23:16.816 --> 00:23:19.378]  Now, I coldly analyze and I get emotional on air.
[00:23:20.018 --> 00:23:20.579]  That's my nature.
[00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:27.204]  But I coldly analyze, make the decision of what the proper course is to take and I do it.
[00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:28.410]  I'd do it.
[00:23:28.911 --> 00:23:42.962]  And we've just had unbelievable success and it's like somebody lit a rocket off underneath us because we are just... I mean, it is bracing, it is staggering to realize we are reaching millions of new people a week, folks.
[00:23:43.002 --> 00:23:45.404]  We are not preaching to the choir, but I love the choir.
[00:23:45.704 --> 00:23:47.065]  You're the people that have spread the word.
[00:23:47.105 --> 00:23:49.507]  You're the people that found out before others about the New World Order.
[00:23:49.787 --> 00:23:54.691]  You're the people that went up against the propaganda and went up against being pilloried and attacked, just like I did.
[00:23:55.111 --> 00:24:00.141]  You have experienced the ostracization, being laughed at, being ridiculed, being fired, being restricted.
[00:24:00.401 --> 00:24:04.369]  I've probably talked to 5, 6, 7 more people at Dell Computer.
[00:24:04.389 --> 00:24:05.551]  They're allowed to surf during lunch.
[00:24:05.571 --> 00:24:07.134]  You surf to InfoWars, you're fired.
[00:24:08.424 --> 00:24:12.007]  You know, people have gone through a lot just to check out this information.
[00:24:12.287 --> 00:24:14.349]  That's why the enemy's moving to restrict free speech.
[00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.111]  That's why all of this is happening.
[00:24:16.331 --> 00:24:17.172]  Go ahead and punch this up.
[00:24:17.192 --> 00:24:17.932]  We're not going to play it.
[00:24:17.973 --> 00:24:19.194]  I want folks to see the text here.
[00:24:19.514 --> 00:24:25.659]  As we go out to break, when we come back, we're going to play Missouri Information Analysis Center phone call to Public Information Officer Sergeant Joe Clark.
[00:24:26.699 --> 00:24:32.504]  Last week regarding, no this is yesterday, regarding the widely discussed training document being circulated on the internet.
[00:24:32.945 --> 00:24:37.689]  This thing only had a few hundred views, it's going to have tens of thousands now, because I want everybody to go to YouTube and watch it.
[00:24:37.709 --> 00:24:43.734]  But we're going to play it when we come back out of this quick break and also give you the title of the video so you can find out.
[00:24:43.754 --> 00:24:47.237]  We're going to post it up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:47.657 --> 00:24:50.300]  But I just couldn't believe people last week thought that I was making this up.
[00:24:51.238 --> 00:24:52.859]  I mean, we got the document.
[00:24:52.899 --> 00:24:54.500]  I've seen many other documents similar to it.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.301]  This one was the most out of control and egregious.
[00:24:56.321 --> 00:24:57.962]  You know, this went the furthest.
[00:24:58.022 --> 00:24:58.702]  Ron Paul stickers.
[00:24:58.722 --> 00:24:59.763]  You're a terrorist, basically.
[00:25:01.104 --> 00:25:03.445]  And so we called and confirmed the state police.
[00:25:03.505 --> 00:25:03.945]  It was theirs.
[00:25:03.985 --> 00:25:05.126]  We got it from the state police.
[00:25:05.746 --> 00:25:08.348]  I got a similar one out of another state just last week.
[00:25:08.528 --> 00:25:10.729]  And more of them are coming in now from police and others.
[00:25:10.769 --> 00:25:11.490]  So send them to us.
[00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:12.150]  Mail them to us.
[00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:13.891]  And we will cover it here.
[00:25:13.931 --> 00:25:17.113]  And everything we cover now becomes national news in a week or two.
[00:25:17.513 --> 00:25:18.554]  We are driving the news.
[00:25:18.634 --> 00:25:19.755]  We are forcing the news.
[00:25:20.717 --> 00:25:21.417]  And the issue's out.
[00:25:21.457 --> 00:25:27.641]  We are fire starters in the minds of men that Thomas Jefferson talked about so much.
[00:25:27.701 --> 00:25:30.182]  By the way, the Obama Deception is out on DVD, folks.
[00:25:30.502 --> 00:25:31.903]  Get it at Infowars.com.
[00:25:31.923 --> 00:25:32.803]  Get the hard copy.
[00:25:33.023 --> 00:25:37.105]  You gotta have this in your library and spread the copy that's on the web to the four winds.
[00:25:37.465 --> 00:25:42.088]  We'll be right back with this key report with one of the state police sergeants.
[00:25:42.128 --> 00:25:42.648]  Stay with us.
[00:25:42.788 --> 00:25:43.749]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:56.213]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[00:25:56.513 --> 00:26:02.536]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:26:02.936 --> 00:26:08.239]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:26:08.679 --> 00:26:10.780]  Starve or surrender.
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.962]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:26:15.442 --> 00:26:16.343]  What then?
[00:26:19.059 --> 00:26:21.880]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:26.301]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[00:26:26.461 --> 00:26:29.301]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.

[00:26:49.804 --> 00:26:55.126]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:26:55.627 --> 00:27:02.610]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:27:03.203 --> 00:27:09.389]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:11.611]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:27:11.771 --> 00:27:14.173]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:27:14.253 --> 00:27:25.243]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:27:25.831 --> 00:27:27.111]  It's not about left or right.
[00:27:27.491 --> 00:27:28.912]  It's about a one world government.
[00:27:29.352 --> 00:27:35.694]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:27:50.541 --> 00:27:52.523]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?

[00:28:27.108 --> 00:28:27.388]  I think so.
[00:28:48.991 --> 00:28:52.613]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:28:52.693 --> 00:28:58.296]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:28:58.416 --> 00:29:02.478]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.

[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:11.123]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[00:29:11.203 --> 00:29:11.704]  I don't know.

[00:29:43.117 --> 00:29:43.798]  Free shipping included.
[00:29:53.310 --> 00:30:02.795]  I'm sorry, Sergeant Clark is on the other line right now.
[00:30:02.815 --> 00:30:08.158]  I can have you hold, I can take your name and number and have him give you a call back.
[00:30:08.598 --> 00:30:10.219]  It's kind of whatever you would prefer.
[00:30:10.699 --> 00:30:13.541]  Well, let me hold for a little bit, please.
[00:30:13.581 --> 00:30:15.262]  Okay, just a moment.
[00:30:32.127 --> 00:30:32.980]  Six minutes later.
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:36.600]  Yes.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.141]  Sergeant Clark?
[00:30:37.361 --> 00:30:37.521]  Yes.
[00:30:37.941 --> 00:30:38.862]  Hi, how are you today?
[00:30:39.082 --> 00:30:39.282]  Very good.
[00:30:39.303 --> 00:30:39.763]  And yourself?
[00:30:39.923 --> 00:30:40.323]  Very good.
[00:30:40.363 --> 00:30:41.144]  Hey, my name is Rob.
[00:30:41.164 --> 00:30:42.805]  I'm with Campaign for Liberty.
[00:30:42.845 --> 00:30:44.867]  I just want to let you know I'm recording this call.
[00:30:44.887 --> 00:30:46.508]  I just would like to ask you a few questions.
[00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:47.149]  Sure.
[00:30:47.309 --> 00:30:48.330]  Trying to clarify.
[00:30:49.831 --> 00:30:57.457]  There's a lot of, as you know, a lot of information circulating on the internet regarding this recent MIAC report that was circulated.
[00:30:57.818 --> 00:30:58.398]  Well, I don't know.
[00:30:58.438 --> 00:31:01.741]  I've not been on the internet to see, but certainly we've taken a bunch of calls.
[00:31:01.801 --> 00:31:03.122]  You're familiar with this report?
[00:31:04.049 --> 00:31:05.155]  Yeah, I'm looking at the report.
[00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:06.645]  If we're talking about the same report.
[00:31:06.906 --> 00:31:07.188]  Okay.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.060]  Just a quick question.
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:17.083]  There's a lot of concern with people who are members of what some people deem as the Liberty Movement, or who are Ron Paul supporters.
[00:31:17.183 --> 00:31:17.463]  Okay.
[00:31:17.883 --> 00:31:20.804]  Members of the Campaign for Liberty, which is a grassroots organization.
[00:31:21.084 --> 00:31:21.344]  Sure.
[00:31:21.444 --> 00:31:35.488]  That was actually very well received recently at CPAC, and many of the members of this organization are predominant members in the leading parties, and again, well received politically on a national level.
[00:31:35.848 --> 00:31:41.370]  And sir, I don't doubt that at all, and I commend you and those folks for everything that they've done.
[00:31:41.950 --> 00:32:01.836]  Okay, I guess the question is, and one of the concerns is, why are people that are part of this liberty movement being labeled or targeted or potentially profiled in this report as really one to believe that this is a list of potential domestic terrorist suspects?
[00:32:02.318 --> 00:32:14.963]  Well, if you read that, I don't see anywhere in that report where it targets anybody, where it profiles anybody, or where it labels anybody of anything as a terrorist or a militia group member or anything like that.
[00:32:15.263 --> 00:32:25.187]  And to think that any law enforcement officer or agency would target somebody for a political affiliation, I think, is inappropriate.
[00:32:27.328 --> 00:32:29.809]  And the report just simply does not say that.
[00:32:30.387 --> 00:32:32.848]  Well, I appreciate that.
[00:32:33.488 --> 00:32:43.950]  What is your understanding of why the Constitution Party, Chuck Baldwin, Bob Barr, and Ron Paul, mention of people displaying Ron Paul bumper stickers?
[00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:45.631]  Why is there a mention of that in the report?
[00:32:46.051 --> 00:32:57.694]  Well, if you read the report, I don't think there's a mention of bumper stickers at all anywhere in the eight-page report, so obviously you haven't read the entirety of the report, or you're looking at a report that's
[00:32:59.693 --> 00:33:00.534]  Yeah, hit pause.
[00:33:00.714 --> 00:33:03.616]  I want to comment there and we'll continue back in about 15 seconds.
[00:33:04.556 --> 00:33:09.539]  I love this video because they put little bubbles up with arrows to where it says Ron Paul bumper stickers.
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.101]  It's the last page.
[00:33:13.982 --> 00:33:16.183]  So, I mean, I'm just getting more and more sick of this.
[00:33:16.203 --> 00:33:20.986]  In fact, I have the original report that everybody's talking about here.
[00:33:21.006 --> 00:33:24.629]  I just showed it on Judge Napolitano's radio and TV show.
[00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:26.510]  I mean, here it is.
[00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:27.511]  This is where it all came from.
[00:33:28.596 --> 00:33:32.438]  Next to last page is Ron Paul right up here with his bumper stickers down here.
[00:33:33.758 --> 00:33:35.019]  Let's go ahead and show folks that again.
[00:33:35.039 --> 00:33:35.379]  Here it is.
[00:33:35.939 --> 00:33:40.721]  Paul, a mention of people displaying Ron Paul bumper stickers.
[00:33:40.761 --> 00:33:42.382]  Why is there a mention of that in the report?
[00:33:42.802 --> 00:33:47.624]  Well, if you read the report, I don't think there's a mention of bumper stickers at all anywhere in the 8-page report.
[00:33:47.664 --> 00:33:54.447]  So obviously you haven't read the entirety of the report or you're looking at a report that's
[00:33:55.009 --> 00:33:56.830]  It's been altered or something else.
[00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:07.815]  I can't speak for why you think that there's something in the report that says people who have a Ron Paul bumper sticker or any political affiliation bumper sticker on their car would be targeted.
[00:34:07.855 --> 00:34:10.216]  That's just simply not true and it's not in the report.
[00:34:11.056 --> 00:34:17.479]  Is there a reference to the so-called Patriot Movement or people who are opposed to North American Union or the New World Order in there?
[00:34:19.028 --> 00:34:28.530]  Well, there's some information in there regarding certain militia groups and those violent factions that operate within those militia groups.
[00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:39.613]  It details their certain belief systems and what political parties or candidates they might associate themselves with.
[00:34:39.893 --> 00:34:47.095]  But certainly the document doesn't say that anybody who's affiliated with a certain political candidate or a political party is certainly
[00:34:47.974 --> 00:34:50.855]  A militia member, a terrorist, or anything like that.
[00:34:52.295 --> 00:34:58.517]  He's a militia member or terrorist, as if being in a militia, which is in the Constitution Bill of Rights, is terrorism.
[00:34:59.978 --> 00:35:05.819]  And it's all, these people want to kill you, here's the stickers they have, Ron Paul, Bob Barr, Libertarian Party.
[00:35:05.839 --> 00:35:11.841]  I mean it says it right there, this is the document, state police have confirmed, this is the document, it's not been altered.
[00:35:13.269 --> 00:35:14.270]  And it's just unbelievable.
[00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:16.772]  We're going to come back and play a little bit more of this, and then go to your phone calls.
[00:35:17.592 --> 00:35:20.234]  Cover a lot of other important, vital news today as well.
[00:35:20.454 --> 00:35:23.136]  The big news is, Israel's saying they may go ahead and hit Iran.
[00:35:23.156 --> 00:35:26.118]  And the Pentagon's saying it looks like that may happen.
[00:35:27.639 --> 00:35:32.743]  They've rattled sabers for a decade before they attacked Iraq, so we're going to be covering that as well.
[00:35:32.783 --> 00:35:34.524]  Stay with us at fullwars.com.
[00:35:39.628 --> 00:35:40.508]  We're on the march.
[00:35:41.009 --> 00:35:42.510]  The empire's on the run.
[00:35:43.519 --> 00:35:46.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:35:57.102 --> 00:36:01.283]  And right now, a one-year food supply that feeds four to five people is only $39.95.
[00:36:01.363 --> 00:36:06.325]  That's right, a one-year supply that feeds four to five people for under $4,000.
[00:36:06.405 --> 00:36:06.745]  That's only
[00:36:10.433 --> 00:36:10.853]  No fillers!
[00:36:28.066 --> 00:36:31.028]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:36:56.153 --> 00:37:01.496]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:37:02.036 --> 00:37:08.220]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.341]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:37:10.501 --> 00:37:12.882]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:37:12.962 --> 00:37:23.848]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:37:26.138 --> 00:37:27.399]  It's not about left or right.
[00:37:27.799 --> 00:37:29.199]  It's about a one world government.

[00:37:44.826 --> 00:37:45.986]  The Obama Deception.
[00:37:46.406 --> 00:37:47.587]  The people strike back.
[00:37:49.275 --> 00:37:50.776]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:37:50.977 --> 00:37:52.418]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:37:52.718 --> 00:37:54.940]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:38:00.144]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:38:00.544 --> 00:38:03.387]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[00:39:00.117 --> 00:39:11.020]  Reuters has got another article out just in the last hour saying we've got to have a global government, a global currency, and a global carbon tax to pay for it.
[00:39:14.681 --> 00:39:16.261]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:39:16.801 --> 00:39:22.843]  And I just got a chance to go on syndicated radio so simulcast with TV with judges.
[00:39:24.059 --> 00:39:27.480]  Napolitano, and hold up the news articles and cover it.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:32.741]  We're going to cover this new one coming up and then go to your calls, Matthew, Jeff, Zachary, William, Tony, and others.
[00:39:33.061 --> 00:39:34.061]  Be ready with your questions and comments.
[00:39:34.081 --> 00:39:43.844]  I want to get to a lot of you before Peter Dale Scott joins us to talk about the shadow government, how they control the phony right wing, how they control the phony left wing, and where he sees all that going.
[00:39:43.864 --> 00:39:45.064]  He's a big researcher into that.
[00:39:45.084 --> 00:39:46.704]  We've been interviewing over the last decade.
[00:39:49.005 --> 00:39:57.792]  Let's go ahead and finish up with the MIAC Sergeant and State Police trying to spin, and that's putting it kindly, the information in the report.
[00:39:57.992 --> 00:39:58.532]  Let's go back to it.
[00:39:58.552 --> 00:40:13.384]  What that document does is actually not true, it's unsubstantiated, and if the report or the training document is read, you would simply see that that's just not the case in the report.
[00:40:14.147 --> 00:40:16.069]  Well, I certainly appreciate that.
[00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:20.632]  What has the response been from the public in general on this, from your perspective?
[00:40:22.394 --> 00:40:24.155]  Is it supportive of the report?
[00:40:24.175 --> 00:40:34.803]  I don't really know how to say, to answer that, because I really don't know what the general public in general has to say about it.
[00:40:34.823 --> 00:40:40.748]  We've taken some calls here at the MIAC in reference to this thing, but as far as
[00:40:41.144 --> 00:40:52.594]  The general public as a whole, I really don't know what their, and for me to say what the general public's perception of this report is would be absolutely speculative in my opinion.
[00:40:52.614 --> 00:41:01.261]  In terms of the, I guess, you're serving as a public liaison in regards to this report to anybody that calls in, is that really a role that you've taken on here?
[00:41:02.995 --> 00:41:19.278]  My duty is within the Missouri Highway Patrol, the public information officer for the Criminal Division of the Highway Patrol, so anything in regards to the MIAC Center when it comes to public information and dissemination of information, yes, that falls under the scope of my responsibility.
[00:41:19.318 --> 00:41:28.300]  And you personally don't have any belief that Ron Paul supporters or people who are supporters of the Constitution pose any threat to society at large, I'm assuming, correct?
[00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:40.018]  Personally, speaking for myself, I don't find anybody just because they're affiliated with a certain political group or party or any danger to society or should be labeled that way.
[00:41:40.579 --> 00:41:42.200]  Do members of MIAC take an oath?
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.981]  They swear an oath to the Constitution?
[00:41:44.242 --> 00:41:44.742]  I don't know.
[00:41:44.842 --> 00:41:47.004]  How about you personally?
[00:41:47.144 --> 00:41:56.712]  I specifically don't know what is entailed when an employee at the MIAC Center, when they're hired on, what oath or what agreement or what they do to obtain their employment.
[00:41:56.752 --> 00:41:59.134]  That's something that you'd have to speak to our human resources.
[00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:00.711]  How about you personally?
[00:42:00.731 --> 00:42:02.352]  You're an officer of the state, right?
[00:42:03.132 --> 00:42:03.713]  Of course, yes.
[00:42:03.793 --> 00:42:07.675]  And you've taken an oath to be sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution?
[00:42:07.695 --> 00:42:08.316]  That's correct.
[00:42:08.656 --> 00:42:09.696]  Well, thank you very much.
[00:42:09.736 --> 00:42:10.517]  I appreciate that.
[00:42:10.757 --> 00:42:11.037]  Thank you.
[00:42:11.337 --> 00:42:12.258]  I thank you for your time, sir.
[00:42:12.658 --> 00:42:12.979]  Good day.
[00:42:17.481 --> 00:42:19.983]  Okay, so there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:20.043 --> 00:42:28.769]  Notice when I had that Army colonel who sent the 20-plus Army MPs into Alabama after that tragic shooting last week.
[00:42:29.722 --> 00:42:33.565]  Notice that when I said, you foreigner protected from the Constitution, he wouldn't answer.
[00:42:33.585 --> 00:42:35.086]  He said, I'm not getting into all of that.
[00:42:36.086 --> 00:42:47.594]  And along those lines, here it is in the Houston Chronicle today and in CNS News, Cyber News Service, Army reviews troop use after fatal Alabama shootings.
[00:42:48.683 --> 00:42:55.529]  The Army has launched an inquiry into whether federal laws were broken when soldiers were sent to an Alabama town after 11 people died in the shooting spree.
[00:42:55.909 --> 00:43:04.957]  The Army confirmed Wednesday that 22 military police and an officer from Fort Rucker, we have the colonel on, were sent to a nearby town of Sampson after the slayings last week.
[00:43:04.997 --> 00:43:09.861]  The town's tiny police force and county officers were stretched to the limit after the gunman killed 10 people and himself.
[00:43:09.981 --> 00:43:11.182]  This is a PR piece.
[00:43:11.963 --> 00:43:16.466]  Authorization from the Governor or President is typically required for the deployment of federal troops on U.S.
[00:43:16.486 --> 00:43:16.826]  soil.
[00:43:17.247 --> 00:43:19.928]  It's not clear who ordered the troops to be sent into Sampson.
[00:43:20.369 --> 00:43:22.770]  An Army spokesman says the military is trying to determine what happened.
[00:43:23.411 --> 00:43:27.193]  Among the question is why the troops were sent and what they did there while they were there.
[00:43:27.794 --> 00:43:37.360]  I mean, I read all these mainstream articles from Oregon and Washington State and other places where they're putting regular Army troops in police departments as liaison officers.
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:41.323]  They're announcing they're going to be at checkpoints, helping at car wrecks, Marines, Army.
[00:43:42.303 --> 00:43:43.084]  This is happening.
[00:43:43.104 --> 00:43:45.906]  They've announced the Army Times, 20,000 troops on the streets of America.
[00:43:46.287 --> 00:43:47.087]  It's all happening.
[00:43:48.168 --> 00:43:50.710]  But they still haven't completely repealed posse comitatus.
[00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:51.771]  They just put loopholes in it.
[00:43:51.791 --> 00:43:53.733]  You could drive a 747 through.
[00:43:54.794 --> 00:43:59.818]  Army investigating how and why troops were sent into Alabama town after a murder spree.
[00:44:00.098 --> 00:44:00.358]  The U.S.
[00:44:00.398 --> 00:44:09.446]  Army has launched an inquiry into how and why active duty troops from Fort Rucker, Alabama, came to be placed on the streets of Sampson, Alabama, during last week's murder spree in that tiny South Alabama community.
[00:44:09.986 --> 00:44:12.748]  The use of the troops was a possible violation of federal law.
[00:44:13.189 --> 00:44:22.996]  On March 10th, after a report on an apparent mass murder in Sampson, Alabama, 22 military police from Fort Rucker, Alabama, along with the provost marshal, were sent to the city of Sampson.
[00:44:23.377 --> 00:44:25.819]  Harvey Preritt, spokesman for the U.S.
[00:44:25.859 --> 00:44:29.902]  Army Training and Doctrine Command at Fort Monroe, Virginia, told CNS News Monday.
[00:44:30.342 --> 00:44:39.026]  The purpose for sending the military police the authority in doing so and what duties they performed is the subject of an ongoing command inquiry directed by the Commanding General of U.S.
[00:44:39.066 --> 00:44:42.088]  Army Training and Docker Command, General Martin Dempsey.
[00:44:44.569 --> 00:44:47.950]  The TRA dock is the headquarters command at Fort Rucker.
[00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:53.753]  Now, by the way, we still get emails and comments on the InfoWars and Prison Planet comment section saying we made all this up, this isn't happening.
[00:44:54.173 --> 00:44:55.794]  Doesn't matter if it's in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:44:55.814 --> 00:44:57.715]  PSYOPS is in there saying it doesn't exist.
[00:45:01.909 --> 00:45:08.451]  The purpose for sending the military police, it continues, in addition to determining the facts, the inquiry will also determine whether law, regulation, or policy were followed.
[00:45:08.831 --> 00:45:12.932]  Perrott added, until those facts are determined, it would be inappropriate to speculate or comment further.
[00:45:13.572 --> 00:45:25.094]  Jim Stormninger, a dispatcher for the Sampson Police Department, confirmed the MP's presence in the town, telling CNS News that the troops came in to help with traffic control and to secure the crime scene, and the department was glad with the help.
[00:45:25.134 --> 00:45:27.695]  So his violation of posse comitatus goes on from there.
[00:45:30.956 --> 00:45:35.738]  So that's just some of what I have there.
[00:45:40.859 --> 00:45:45.781]  Let me go ahead and cover this article, this group of articles, and we're going to your calls.
[00:45:49.761 --> 00:45:52.943]  Global carbon price unlikely for 10 to 15 years analysts.
[00:45:52.963 --> 00:45:53.583]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:45:53.924 --> 00:45:55.044]  Now, they always do this.
[00:45:55.284 --> 00:46:00.828]  Oh, you know, they have the European Union 50 year celebrations in 2007, but they claim it was founded in 2000.
[00:46:01.228 --> 00:46:07.752]  See, we're already... Bush, it's in endgame, on the White House lawn, admitted they've already merged the EU with the North American Union.
[00:46:08.272 --> 00:46:10.093]  Merkel and Barroso, they're all up there singing.
[00:46:10.513 --> 00:46:11.134]  Leaders of Europe.
[00:46:12.372 --> 00:46:17.314]  And this is what they do, they go, oh, we're not going to have a carbon tax for a while, don't worry about it, but we've got to agree on one.
[00:46:17.895 --> 00:46:29.741]  Meanwhile, here's one in Telegraph and literally scores of other publications, saying the IMF is printing a super currency already and issuing it to banks, but it's all secret.
[00:46:30.201 --> 00:46:36.304]  So, you pay your taxes through the federal government, the IMF and World Bank, and then they basically issue it to their cronies and their buddies.
[00:46:37.981 --> 00:46:38.501]  Then it goes on.
[00:46:38.521 --> 00:46:48.347]  The International Monetary Fund is poised to embark on what analysts have described as global quantitative easing by printing millions of dollars worth of global super currency in an unprecedented new effort to address the economic crisis.
[00:46:48.367 --> 00:46:51.829]  We've got a story up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:46:52.789 --> 00:46:54.050]  It's here in my stack.
[00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:54.850]  I'm trying to find it.
[00:46:55.491 --> 00:46:57.372]  Where they say they're already issuing it.
[00:46:57.472 --> 00:46:58.752]  So, that's how...
[00:47:00.578 --> 00:47:01.759]  They work and how they operate.
[00:47:01.779 --> 00:47:04.540]  They say, we're going to start doing this, and you find out they've already been doing it.
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:08.782]  And the private Federal Reserve has been issuing secret, secret new funds.
[00:47:09.483 --> 00:47:11.624]  That was in the New York Times three months ago.
[00:47:12.144 --> 00:47:16.347]  So that's why Geithner will never answer what they're doing, because they're setting up a global government.
[00:47:16.367 --> 00:47:18.208]  And they don't want the public to know about it.
[00:47:18.788 --> 00:47:21.329]  But then when you read the financial publications, they admit what's happening.
[00:47:24.691 --> 00:47:26.692]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[00:47:26.792 --> 00:47:29.694]  Matthew in Montana, you're on the air, welcome.
[00:47:30.313 --> 00:47:32.114]  Hello, Alex from Montana.
[00:47:32.174 --> 00:47:34.576]  Long live the Republic and long live the truth.
[00:47:34.636 --> 00:47:43.962]  We're doing our job over here in Montana and getting hours of your documentaries out on AXS television every week for years now.
[00:47:44.583 --> 00:47:46.604]  Has it had an effect in your area?
[00:47:47.565 --> 00:47:48.385]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:47:48.886 --> 00:47:57.592]  I think Montana is at the forefront of freedom and the Second Amendment, as you know, the state sovereignty movement, and now the latest
[00:47:59.147 --> 00:48:06.276]  That's on GCN page, the hard money issue is going through the state legislature right now.
[00:48:07.097 --> 00:48:09.379]  We're fighting a good fight.
[00:48:12.999 --> 00:48:20.146]  I mean, we're still a minority, but a much larger minority compared to, like you were pointing out, 10 or 20 years ago.
[00:48:20.567 --> 00:48:23.710]  That's just because the general public, all of them, don't know about us.
[00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:26.232]  If you ask the public, are you against the banks robbing you blind?
[00:48:26.252 --> 00:48:28.955]  Are you against an unelected world government run by the banks that did it?
[00:48:30.136 --> 00:48:31.257]  Are you against open borders?
[00:48:31.297 --> 00:48:32.418]  They're against everything.
[00:48:32.438 --> 00:48:33.259]  They agree with us.
[00:48:33.339 --> 00:48:34.160]  It's common sense.
[00:48:35.121 --> 00:48:36.783]  Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.
[00:48:37.104 --> 00:48:42.329]  And we're a threat to the new rule order or they wouldn't be secretly demonizing us to every police agency out there.
[00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:44.552]  Oh, you're absolutely right.
[00:48:45.172 --> 00:48:48.256]  And when I say a minority, I mean that in a positive way.
[00:48:48.336 --> 00:48:55.864]  I mean, we, you know, years ago we were a small percentage and now I don't know what we are, 10, 20 percent, you know, so.
[00:48:57.405 --> 00:49:03.907]  We're definitely having an impact, and as you point out, the truth is exploding exponentially.
[00:49:03.947 --> 00:49:05.608]  Oh my gosh, it's frightening.
[00:49:07.848 --> 00:49:23.733]  I was doing this years ago during Gulf War I. I was publishing a paper and going on radio and TV, and just like you were pointing out, I'd come home and my answering machine would just be full of calls calling me a traitor and anti-American and everything else because of that time.
[00:49:24.677 --> 00:49:49.320]  We were, you know, talking about the New World Order, bringing out the documents, showing everybody, and of course we were called anti-American and everything else, but, you know, thank God, going in the 21st century, people like yourself have taken the lead and, you know, going forward with the truth, and getting it out there, because like you point out, the truth will ultimately prevail, and it is prevailing.
[00:49:49.688 --> 00:49:51.710]  Absolutely, sir, I appreciate your call.
[00:49:51.970 --> 00:50:07.443]  I was just watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, they put the website up there with rotating articles, and I saw and confirmed a bunch of Facebook accounts with hundreds and in some cases thousands of members erasing links to the Obama deception, banning accounts that put out the Obama deception.
[00:50:10.905 --> 00:50:22.373]  I was just looking on the screen, I'm trying to pull it up, I saw a new censorship article dealing with the Obama deception, but my computer, my little $300 Acer is not loading.
[00:50:23.254 --> 00:50:27.017]  It says, Christian, YouTube censors Obama deception.
[00:50:27.037 --> 00:50:27.677]  What does that mean?
[00:50:28.398 --> 00:50:32.701]  It says, a site that brands itself as a kind of YouTube for Christians.
[00:50:35.222 --> 00:50:44.055]  Which was formerly known as GodTube.com has censored Alex Jones' newest film, The Obama Deception, after claiming the documentary.
[00:50:48.615 --> 00:50:49.776]  Contains slander and libel.
[00:50:49.796 --> 00:50:50.837]  I was reading it across the room.
[00:50:51.237 --> 00:51:02.546]  One of our readers tried to upload the Obama deception to the Tangle website in four parts, but two of the sections never made it and the reader was subsequently contacted by the Community Care Administrator for Tangle.
[00:51:02.967 --> 00:51:05.809]  Hello and thank you for using Tangle, said the email.
[00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:07.671]  Your video contains slander and libel.
[00:51:07.711 --> 00:51:07.911]  Really?
[00:51:07.951 --> 00:51:08.852]  A court found that, huh?
[00:51:09.372 --> 00:51:13.474]  We cannot allow this content on the site without documented proof of the accusations.
[00:51:13.894 --> 00:51:16.275]  Please refer to our terms of use information.
[00:51:16.575 --> 00:51:17.076]  Well, that's fine.
[00:51:17.096 --> 00:51:19.297]  It's their little miserable censorship channel.
[00:51:19.617 --> 00:51:33.524]  I mean, you know, I don't know about this site, but most of the big churches publicly, Obama's continuing the faith-based initiative, tens of billions of churches, and they're buying them off the clergy response teams, you know, to go out and tell people to accept martial law and Obama's of God and of the Lord.
[00:51:33.564 --> 00:51:37.465]  We've shown you what they teach in Catholic, Protestant churches.
[00:51:37.485 --> 00:51:38.126]  It doesn't matter.
[00:51:39.474 --> 00:51:40.355]  And so there you have it.
[00:51:40.375 --> 00:51:43.176]  More and more censorship of the Obama deception.
[00:51:43.396 --> 00:51:51.001]  And I read in the first hour how all over the world, Canada, Australia, they're just saying, we're going to ban political websites.
[00:51:51.061 --> 00:51:52.002]  It's now happening.
[00:51:52.742 --> 00:51:54.683]  This is really going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:55.524 --> 00:51:59.466]  And so I suggest that everybody go to the website.
[00:51:59.887 --> 00:52:02.688]  In fact, give me the specific address.
[00:52:02.708 --> 00:52:04.109]  Will you scroll down a bit so I can see it, guys?
[00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:05.510]  Or just print me the story?
[00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:07.331]  It's kind of hard to read it when I can't see it.
[00:52:07.371 --> 00:52:07.551]  Thanks.
[00:52:10.489 --> 00:52:13.672]  The website is tangle.com.
[00:52:14.012 --> 00:52:21.579]  People should just go and upload lots of short videos saying, go to theobamadeception.net and find out what's being censored.
[00:52:21.599 --> 00:52:25.662]  Just keep uploading it over and over again and they won't be able to stop you doing that.
[00:52:25.762 --> 00:52:27.304]  Just upload 20 second videos.
[00:52:28.164 --> 00:52:30.346]  Basically, it's a quick and easy to get that done.
[00:52:31.207 --> 00:52:35.531]  But yes, and as Obamadeception goes more and more viral, you're going to see more and more of this censorship.
[00:52:37.418 --> 00:52:41.863]  Let's go ahead and go back to the callers here.
[00:52:42.965 --> 00:52:45.027]  Let's talk to Jeff in Ohio.
[00:52:45.087 --> 00:52:45.908]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[00:52:45.928 --> 00:52:47.811]  Yeah, what's up Alex?
[00:52:48.151 --> 00:52:50.093]  I just have a couple questions for you.
[00:52:50.113 --> 00:52:55.400]  I don't know if you know anything about Sandusky, Ohio being built after the square and compass.
[00:52:56.966 --> 00:53:12.057]  I know a lot of major cities and even small towns like the place where Skull and Bones is located in Connecticut, that they are set up according to the sacred geometry or architecture, yes.
[00:53:12.117 --> 00:53:24.066]  Alright, well I was just wondering, here in Ohio on Saturday they have every Masonic Lodge has got an open house, supposedly, and I was just wondering
[00:53:24.756 --> 00:53:28.567]  On your opinion, you think it'd be a good idea, a bad idea to go and try and ask questions?
[00:53:29.269 --> 00:53:30.051]  Oh, I think it's great.
[00:53:30.071 --> 00:53:32.338]  Look, you're going to find... I want to be clear about this.
[00:53:33.988 --> 00:53:38.572]  And I always mention this and people act like it's some big secret and they found me out when it was on my show.
[00:53:38.692 --> 00:53:39.653]  We're on air right now.
[00:53:40.073 --> 00:53:44.376]  They'll cut clips out and go, this was secretly behind scenes with Alex on TV and we have it.
[00:53:44.396 --> 00:53:47.799]  And then they clip it to real short with me going, I have family that are Masons.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.922]  And then look, look, we caught the secret video.
[00:53:51.542 --> 00:53:53.684]  It's all sorts of deception is used.
[00:53:54.084 --> 00:53:55.425]  It's a lone star state.
[00:53:55.485 --> 00:53:57.667]  Texas was founded by predominantly Masons.
[00:53:59.188 --> 00:54:01.490]  And George Washington was a Mason.
[00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:03.252]  I guess about half the founders were.
[00:54:04.682 --> 00:54:06.383]  But they were what you call porch masons.
[00:54:07.543 --> 00:54:10.524]  And it's such a complex situation.
[00:54:11.404 --> 00:54:14.625]  Technology, mathematics, knowledge has always been power.
[00:54:14.845 --> 00:54:24.889]  And you go back 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 years ago in Babylon in Egypt, or then in Israel later, or in Tyre, or in Greece, or in Rome, knowledge was very coveted.
[00:54:24.909 --> 00:54:27.090]  And they had secret mystery schools.
[00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:31.651]  When you hear mystery schools, it had all these gods and mumbo-jumbo and temple prostitutes and everything else.
[00:54:31.691 --> 00:54:33.532]  But it was also mathematics.
[00:54:34.452 --> 00:54:37.873]  And, you know, they called, you know, basically metal work, you know, alchemy.
[00:54:39.053 --> 00:54:42.113]  So science was mixed in with superstition and mumbo-jumbo.
[00:54:43.054 --> 00:54:45.034]  And so you have these fraternal brotherhoods.
[00:54:45.534 --> 00:54:52.115]  But clearly, masonry has been used as a vehicle in the last 300 years for dark forces.
[00:54:52.715 --> 00:54:56.256]  You know, secret societies before were what we call intelligence agencies today.
[00:54:56.276 --> 00:55:01.997]  And George Washington, before he died, said there's something terrible in masonry, something bad in it, there's bad people at the higher levels of it.
[00:55:03.189 --> 00:55:04.609]  And so there's been a fight within it.
[00:55:04.949 --> 00:55:09.891]  But then it turns people off, and then they think, you know, that this show's lying about them.
[00:55:10.671 --> 00:55:16.632]  When 98% of Masons are porch Masons, that is, they're outer Masons, they're compartmentalized, they don't know what they're a part of.
[00:55:17.392 --> 00:55:19.333]  And, I mean, Colonel Travis was a Mason.
[00:55:21.333 --> 00:55:22.513]  Sam Houston was a Mason.
[00:55:22.553 --> 00:55:23.714]  They were not bad people.
[00:55:25.534 --> 00:55:27.094]  I believe Andrew Jackson was a Mason.
[00:55:27.134 --> 00:55:29.815]  But, you know, he fought the global bankers and the New World Order, the British Masons.
[00:55:30.738 --> 00:55:37.145]  So it's an oversimplification to think that you're going to go into any masonic lodge and there are a bunch of devil worshippers.
[00:55:37.245 --> 00:55:49.377]  They don't know that in the higher degrees, and this is a fact, morals and dogma, Albert Pike, the books that Manly P. Hall wrote, which are published and available, go to the library and read them.
[00:55:50.666 --> 00:55:54.670]  They openly say at the higher levels it is Lucifer they're worshipping and that's a bad thing.
[00:55:54.690 --> 00:56:00.976]  But they believe Lucifer is really the good God and the other God is like his brother in his bag as he tried to keep the knowledge from the people.
[00:56:01.356 --> 00:56:05.540]  In fact, pull up that YouTube, just Google Mason says he loves Lucifer.
[00:56:06.201 --> 00:56:07.782]  Where he goes, oh, sweet Lucifer.
[00:56:07.802 --> 00:56:12.005]  And, you know, people watch this, you see Masons commenting, oh, well, he was just joking.
[00:56:12.025 --> 00:56:15.126]  You know, because they're lower Masons and don't know this is really what's going on.
[00:56:15.166 --> 00:56:33.157]  So I would go to them and explain to them in that way and ask them questions and give them a copy of the Obama Deception, because we've got to go after Jews, Muslims, Christians, Masons, Hindus, agnostics, atheists, with the message of liberty and freedom so they can wake up and then make informed decisions.
[00:56:33.217 --> 00:56:34.078]  Does that answer your question?
[00:56:34.719 --> 00:56:37.162]  Uh, yeah, actually it does.
[00:56:49.448 --> 00:56:54.612]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin cream's personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[00:56:54.873 --> 00:57:03.840]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes are full of chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:07.463]  Did you know that most multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[00:57:07.483 --> 00:57:07.863]  I think so.
[00:57:29.523 --> 00:57:32.246]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[00:57:53.143 --> 00:57:55.267]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:57:55.768 --> 00:58:02.802]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:09.541]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:09.922 --> 00:58:11.762]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:11.902 --> 00:58:14.323]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:14.403 --> 00:58:25.325]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:58:25.965 --> 00:58:27.266]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:27.646 --> 00:58:29.006]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:58:29.514 --> 00:58:35.857]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:58:36.417 --> 00:58:44.200]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:44.681 --> 00:58:45.821]  The Obama Deception.
[00:58:46.241 --> 00:58:47.442]  The people strike back.
[00:58:49.631 --> 00:58:56.798]  We know identity scams have grown in the past six months because identity thieves are working overtime taking advantage of this economic crisis.
[00:58:57.318 --> 00:58:59.200]  I'm Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:04.385]  I talk to people every day about identity theft and I know a lot of you are scared and nervous.
[00:59:04.705 --> 00:59:06.506]  I'm here to tell you, you don't have to be.
[00:59:06.766 --> 00:59:14.928]  Another identity is stolen every three seconds, but you can have the security and peace of mind that comes with being protected by LifeLock for just pennies a day.
[00:59:15.148 --> 00:59:24.351]  LifeLock is number one in identity theft protection because we work to stop identity theft before it happens, or we fix it at our expense up to one million dollars.
[00:59:24.631 --> 00:59:26.452]  Don't spend another minute worrying.
[00:59:26.712 --> 00:59:27.832]  Call LifeLock now.
[00:59:30.009 --> 00:59:30.209]  We're good.
[00:59:55.871 --> 00:59:59.674]  The Dallas Observer just did a review of the Obama Deception.
[01:00:01.955 --> 01:00:09.661]  But they said, oh, Jones is claiming millions of views, but it only says 160,000 on a YouTube channel.
[01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:15.165]  There's hundreds of versions of it posted on YouTube and Google.
[01:00:16.365 --> 01:00:30.592]  And you'll see one with two hundred and something thousand views, and another with a hundred and sixty thousand views, and another with a hundred and twenty thousand views, another with eighty thousand views, another with a hundred and twenty thousand views, another with, you know, two hundred and fifty thousand views.
[01:00:31.253 --> 01:00:32.013]  That's what we're seeing.
[01:00:32.033 --> 01:00:36.996]  See how people think kind of two-dimensionally instead of three-dimensionally?
[01:00:37.016 --> 01:00:43.379]  They say, oh, well, I'm seeing one copy of it that says a hundred and sixty thousand views, so that means there's not millions watching.
[01:00:43.959 --> 01:00:44.700]  What does that mean?
[01:00:47.329 --> 01:00:48.910]  I mean, why don't people's brains work right?
[01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:52.231]  We're not even trying to go see where it's posted everywhere.
[01:00:52.271 --> 01:00:54.192]  It's all over every video site we've looked at.
[01:00:54.552 --> 01:00:55.532]  Hundreds that we've looked at.
[01:00:55.572 --> 01:00:56.853]  Burmese is obsessed with this stuff.
[01:00:57.413 --> 01:01:00.094]  And they're just hours loving it.
[01:01:00.134 --> 01:01:01.394]  He loves to communicate with humanity.
[01:01:01.414 --> 01:01:02.375]  He loves to be involved in this.
[01:01:03.547 --> 01:01:05.930]  And it's very exciting, so it is free all over the internet.
[01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:10.195]  But the best quality copy has changed the channel's channel on YouTube.
[01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:11.957]  Super good end code for YouTube.
[01:01:12.777 --> 01:01:15.901]  That's the one we've linked to at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:15.921 --> 01:01:17.162]  We want to make that number one.
[01:01:17.182 --> 01:01:20.005]  There's a bunch of cruddy copies with two hundred and something thousand views.
[01:01:21.252 --> 01:01:21.612]  Above it.
[01:01:21.932 --> 01:01:24.474]  So that's what's linked all over the web when you Google the Obama deception.
[01:01:25.414 --> 01:01:37.922]  So, in fact, ask Kurt and Paul, and then just to post again somewhere on the main page for the next few days so people can find it easy, not just in sub-pages or it moves down the page, the change-the-channel version, so we can drive that up to number one.
[01:01:37.942 --> 01:01:41.083]  So people, if they're going to take two hours out to watch it, we'll see it in high quality.
[01:01:41.984 --> 01:01:46.687]  See it in super high quality compared to that at PrisonPlanet.tv and fund our operation, and we need the capital.
[01:01:47.847 --> 01:01:53.092]  I'm going to continue with your phone calls the next segment and then on into Peter Del Scott coming on.
[01:01:54.313 --> 01:01:56.795]  Speaking of sponsors, I am such a ding dong.
[01:01:56.855 --> 01:02:00.498]  I check out all the sponsors we take, I like them, I support them, and then I'm so brain dead.
[01:02:00.518 --> 01:02:06.083]  I said the name of this site wrong yesterday like a ding dong, but it's HomeGain.com.
[01:02:06.524 --> 01:02:08.546]  HomeGain.com.
[01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:13.030]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.
[01:02:16.505 --> 01:02:24.612]  This is the place to get you started buying or selling a home, finding a realtor, and getting any real estate questions answered.
[01:02:25.472 --> 01:02:29.155]  Go to HomeGain.com and see what I'm talking about.
[01:02:29.576 --> 01:02:32.138]  The one I plugged wrongly yesterday was some RFID site.
[01:02:34.809 --> 01:02:40.894]  All you need to do is type in your home address and you will get an instant free estimate on your home values online.
[01:02:40.934 --> 01:02:45.438]  It is a great way to be able to monitor the value of your home from month to month or even weekly.
[01:02:45.878 --> 01:02:46.599]  And again, it's free.
[01:02:46.799 --> 01:02:48.541]  There are tons of tools to help you.
[01:02:49.261 --> 01:02:52.985]  For instance, if you want to remodel your home, go to HomeGain.com.
[01:02:53.406 --> 01:02:59.933]  Use their Home Sales Maximizer to help you determine which home improvements can most increase your home's value before you put it on the market.
[01:03:00.514 --> 01:03:01.896]  I wish I knew about this thing years ago.
[01:03:01.916 --> 01:03:02.596]  Yeah, it's really neat.
[01:03:02.957 --> 01:03:06.381]  For 10 years, these folks have been helping home sellers and buyers.
[01:03:06.481 --> 01:03:09.404]  It's HomeGain, G-A-I-N dot com.
[01:03:10.609 --> 01:03:12.411]  And of course, this sponsor needs no introduction.
[01:03:12.431 --> 01:03:13.551]  They're just fabulous folks.
[01:03:13.612 --> 01:03:15.633]  The best storable foods company out there.
[01:03:16.134 --> 01:03:17.194]  Super high quality food.
[01:03:17.295 --> 01:03:17.935]  Non-GMO.
[01:03:17.995 --> 01:03:18.576]  Just packaged.
[01:03:18.596 --> 01:03:20.217]  Within weeks of them shipping it out to you.

[01:03:36.949 --> 01:03:44.392]  Kind of as a sampler, I suggest you get eFoodsDirect.com, the letter eFoodsDirect.com, or 1-800-409-5633.
[01:03:44.712 --> 01:03:45.032]  That's 1-800-409-5633.
[01:03:45.052 --> 01:03:56.017]  And then on the line of preparedness, we just love ours, and I've got one at my house as well, Ecoloblue, E-C-O-L-O-BLUE.com, atmospheric water generator for your home.
[01:03:56.337 --> 01:04:00.359]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store, pure clean water without the fluoride.
[01:04:01.039 --> 01:04:02.519]  Unlimited water from the humidity in the air.
[01:04:02.539 --> 01:04:03.740]  Know exactly what you're drinking.
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.840]  Machine produces up to 28 liters of water, 24 hours, 7.5 gallons.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.520]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:09.301]  Neutral pH.
[01:04:10.021 --> 01:04:15.082]  And it runs through seven different filters, including UV light, carbon filter, and reverse osmosis.
[01:04:15.162 --> 01:04:16.282]  It doesn't get any better than this.
[01:04:16.302 --> 01:04:16.802]  acolablue.com.
[01:04:16.822 --> 01:04:18.082]  E-C-O-L-L-E-B-L-U-E dot com, or 800-691-6043.
[01:04:18.102 --> 01:04:18.522]  800-691-6043. acolablue.com.
[01:04:18.542 --> 01:04:19.582]  All right, final hour, straight ahead.
[01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:20.243]  Stay with us.
[01:04:30.856 --> 01:04:32.638]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:04:34.099 --> 01:04:36.321]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:04:39.241 --> 01:04:40.802]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:40.922 --> 01:04:45.526]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:04:45.666 --> 01:04:48.428]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:04:48.629 --> 01:04:51.491]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:04:51.671 --> 01:04:55.334]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[01:04:55.494 --> 01:05:00.738]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:05:00.998 --> 01:05:07.884]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:05:07.984 --> 01:05:11.086]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:05:11.246 --> 01:05:12.027]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:05:12.167 --> 01:05:16.190]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:16.410 --> 01:05:22.494]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.

[01:05:29.839 --> 01:05:33.862]  Again, 1-800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:34.022 --> 01:05:34.982]  Take action today.
[01:05:35.163 --> 01:05:36.944]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:05:41.986 --> 01:05:43.912]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:05:44.393 --> 01:05:47.161]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:56.565]  All right, Peter Dale Scott's coming up in the next segment.
[01:05:56.585 --> 01:05:58.066]  We'll also take calls during that.
[01:05:58.406 --> 01:06:06.511]  This type of stuff comes in our mail every day, not just secret state police reports, saying anybody that loves America is a terrorist, basically.
[01:06:06.891 --> 01:06:12.775]  Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, in conjunction with the officers of Superior Gloria Molina First District,
[01:06:13.775 --> 01:06:15.095]  It says gifts for guns.
[01:06:15.175 --> 01:06:16.716]  Exchange your firearms for gift cards.
[01:06:16.776 --> 01:06:21.397]  Walmart, Ralph's Supermarkets, Food for Less Supermarkets and Target stores.
[01:06:21.437 --> 01:06:22.278]  No questions asked.
[01:06:22.918 --> 01:06:23.858]  No strings attached.
[01:06:23.998 --> 01:06:25.799]  And every time we check this, it's not true.
[01:06:25.819 --> 01:06:26.719]  There are strings attached.
[01:06:27.679 --> 01:06:28.459]  You remain anonymous.
[01:06:28.499 --> 01:06:30.920]  Please leave your firearms in the trunk of your car.
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:33.881]  Because they come to your car to get your license plate when they take it.
[01:06:33.961 --> 01:06:34.541]  Oh my God.
[01:06:35.121 --> 01:06:36.322]  Join us March 28th, 2009.
[01:06:36.662 --> 01:06:38.402]  The cops lie, folks.
[01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:39.222]  It's... They're trained to.
[01:06:39.903 --> 01:06:40.343]  Register.
[01:06:42.864 --> 01:06:44.406]  And it says, uh, rear parking lot.
[01:06:44.426 --> 01:06:48.591]  So you see, you register your name, you go in, they go to your car and register you, but, oh, it's anonymous.
[01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:50.653]  Right here it contradicts itself.
[01:06:51.554 --> 01:06:52.696]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:53.737 --> 01:06:55.639]  You register, they come out to your car, they get it.
[01:06:56.119 --> 01:06:58.542]  You register, but, but they don't know you gave them a gun.
[01:06:59.363 --> 01:07:00.645]  For a, uh, gift certificate.
[01:07:02.432 --> 01:07:08.675]  This is the type of crap as they, and they always have news cameras there to create the image of, to condition people.
[01:07:08.695 --> 01:07:10.956]  They did this in England and Australia before they confiscated guns.
[01:07:11.476 --> 01:07:13.817]  To have the images of people lined up turning guns in.
[01:07:14.057 --> 01:07:15.718]  They're doing this in Dallas, Texas.
[01:07:15.738 --> 01:07:16.758]  They're doing this in every state.
[01:07:17.158 --> 01:07:18.159]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:07:18.179 --> 01:07:20.960]  It doesn't say what you get here.
[01:07:23.268 --> 01:07:26.169]  There's a little asterisk that says, for gift cards.
[01:07:26.869 --> 01:07:28.010]  And I don't see the asterisk.
[01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:29.590]  It says, while supplies last.
[01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:32.191]  So, that means they'll just go, ah, go ahead and give me that gun.
[01:07:32.211 --> 01:07:34.011]  Oh, they're going to arrest some people.
[01:07:34.632 --> 01:07:35.992]  They run the backgrounds on the guns.
[01:07:36.032 --> 01:07:36.512]  What idiots.
[01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:37.733]  But hey, they want to be slaves.
[01:07:37.773 --> 01:07:38.053]  Go ahead.
[01:07:38.793 --> 01:07:43.454]  Let's go ahead and talk to William in Michigan, and Groom, Melissa, Danny, Alex, and others.
[01:07:43.514 --> 01:07:44.455]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, stop!
[01:07:44.955 --> 01:07:45.795]  Alex disagrees.
[01:07:46.055 --> 01:07:47.596]  I'd miss seeing that.
[01:07:48.656 --> 01:07:50.798]  Uh, so let's go to the head of the line for him.
[01:07:50.818 --> 01:07:53.120]  If he can remain civil, we'll keep him on a minute.
[01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:53.620]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:07:54.701 --> 01:07:55.001]  I don't.
[01:07:55.962 --> 01:07:58.224]  Um, I wanted, uh, can you hear me alright, first of all?
[01:07:59.125 --> 01:08:01.386]  Is this the guy always calling in, plugging his music videos?
[01:08:02.447 --> 01:08:04.309]  No, no, I don't even know who that is.
[01:08:04.389 --> 01:08:05.750]  Okay, because the guy calls with different names.
[01:08:05.810 --> 01:08:07.591]  Okay, go ahead and make your point, sir.
[01:08:08.412 --> 01:08:15.658]  Okay, um, well you were talking about Freemasonry, and you make the point a lot where you say, um, that they were porch masons.
[01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:18.100]  I don't think that's the case at all, like, for case in point.
[01:08:19.036 --> 01:08:26.344]  Andrew Jackson, that guy who shut down the first two national banks that they tried to set up in our country.
[01:08:28.186 --> 01:08:30.128]  He wasn't just some kind of pork mason.
[01:08:30.208 --> 01:08:33.091]  He was the Grand Master of Tennessee Freemasonry.
[01:08:33.111 --> 01:08:33.791]  That's right.
[01:08:33.991 --> 01:08:34.912]  I knew I read that.
[01:08:35.273 --> 01:08:37.035]  I knew I read that he was a mason, yeah.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.421]  That's why I said five minutes ago.
[01:08:40.442 --> 01:08:44.444]  He was the grandmaster of Tennessee Freemasonry.
[01:08:45.005 --> 01:08:47.566]  Well, I just said Texas was founded by Masons.
[01:08:48.367 --> 01:08:55.692]  Are you saying that there aren't all these top Masons that have published books saying their god is Lucifer?
[01:08:57.074 --> 01:09:02.576]  Oh, sure, but they think Jesus is Lucifer, though, so they have this weird, like, take on it.
[01:09:02.876 --> 01:09:03.556]  That's kind of it.
[01:09:03.596 --> 01:09:04.576]  No, that's a mid-level.
[01:09:04.616 --> 01:09:06.037]  No, they think it's dual.
[01:09:06.797 --> 01:09:08.197]  But it's two different creatures.
[01:09:08.738 --> 01:09:11.858]  Look, I mean, okay, so you disagree with that.
[01:09:12.219 --> 01:09:12.679]  You're right.
[01:09:13.019 --> 01:09:14.179]  Some of them weren't porch masons.
[01:09:14.579 --> 01:09:18.741]  My point is that George Washington did speak out about what was happening in masonry.
[01:09:18.761 --> 01:09:19.441]  That's on record.
[01:09:20.221 --> 01:09:20.541]  Okay.
[01:09:20.581 --> 01:09:26.023]  Oh, yeah, the top-level masons in England spoke out about what was happening in masonry, too.
[01:09:27.821 --> 01:09:30.163]  I forgot who his name was.
[01:09:30.183 --> 01:09:38.090]  He was one of the top grandmasters of English Freemasonry, talking about some son-to-order taking over Freemasonry.
[01:09:38.170 --> 01:09:41.552]  Black son, yeah.
[01:09:42.193 --> 01:09:48.958]  But this is where it gets kind of... Let me ask you a question.
[01:09:48.978 --> 01:09:50.480]  Do you like people like Chiang Kai-shek?
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:54.002]  Chiang Kai-shek, the guy who fought Mao Zedong.
[01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:54.463]  China.
[01:09:54.883 --> 01:09:55.223]  China.
[01:09:55.484 --> 01:09:56.845]  That guy was a big Freemason.
[01:09:58.325 --> 01:10:03.906]  Yeah, and the CIA betrayed him, and kicked him out, and didn't give him the weapons, and put Mao in, and that's now declassified.
[01:10:04.747 --> 01:10:06.027]  Look at something like the CIA.
[01:10:06.167 --> 01:10:08.508]  I haven't seen any Freemasons in the CIA.
[01:10:08.608 --> 01:10:10.228]  I've only seen... Oh, are you joking?
[01:10:10.908 --> 01:10:11.668]  Are you joking?
[01:10:11.728 --> 01:10:13.529]  I got a big amount of money.
[01:10:13.589 --> 01:10:15.169]  Hold on a second.
[01:10:15.929 --> 01:10:17.330]  You know, you're not letting me talk.
[01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:19.130]  You just keep mumbling.
[01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:25.332]  I mean, I'm letting you make your points, but you just said you haven't seen any Freemasons in the CIA.
[01:10:28.929 --> 01:10:29.309]  You worry.
[01:10:29.369 --> 01:10:31.031]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:10:31.071 --> 01:10:32.632]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:10:32.892 --> 01:10:35.154]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[01:11:00.947 --> 01:11:01.127]  I think?
[01:11:31.252 --> 01:11:32.873]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[01:11:53.061 --> 01:11:55.185]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:11:55.686 --> 01:12:02.721]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:12:03.254 --> 01:12:09.436]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:12:09.837 --> 01:12:11.677]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:12:11.817 --> 01:12:14.238]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:12:14.318 --> 01:12:25.243]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:12:25.883 --> 01:12:27.183]  It's not about left or right.
[01:12:27.563 --> 01:12:28.924]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:12:29.429 --> 01:12:35.717]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:12:46.169 --> 01:12:47.371]  The people strike back.
[01:12:49.309 --> 01:12:54.977]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[01:12:55.257 --> 01:13:00.043]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[01:13:00.284 --> 01:13:04.189]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[01:13:04.189 --> 01:13:04.629]  We're good to go!
[01:13:32.285 --> 01:13:34.706]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment?

[01:13:50.953 --> 01:13:56.976]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:13:57.576 --> 01:14:00.578]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:14:01.374 --> 01:14:02.736]  Okay, we are back live.
[01:14:02.756 --> 01:14:04.237]  Got about 52 minutes left in the show.
[01:14:04.257 --> 01:14:06.099]  We'll open the phones up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.083]  Professor Peter Dell Scott is our guest.
[01:14:09.323 --> 01:14:12.707]  Author, researcher, just an amazing individual.
[01:14:13.187 --> 01:14:19.554]  Peter, you've got such an interesting bio, and you wrote seminal works exposing government narcotics trafficking.
[01:14:20.935 --> 01:14:32.647]  I don't even know where to start with you, but he's a Canadian poet and former English professor at the University of California, Berkeley, the son of noted Canadian poet and constitutional lawyer F.R.
[01:14:32.687 --> 01:14:33.028]  Scott.
[01:14:33.808 --> 01:14:36.451]  He is known for his anti-war stance and his criticism of U.S.
[01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:38.273]  foreign policy dating back to the Vietnam War.
[01:14:38.793 --> 01:14:41.976]  He's researched and written several investigative books about the role of deep state
[01:14:42.637 --> 01:14:45.038]  As opposed to the public state, or I'd call the shadow government.
[01:14:45.338 --> 01:14:51.961]  However, Scott rejects the label of conspiracy theory and has used the phrase deep politics to describe his heavily footnoted political writing.
[01:14:52.401 --> 01:14:53.322]  The investigative bent.
[01:14:54.275 --> 01:15:04.645]  Uh, has spilt over into his works of poetry, some of which must contain marginal notes to explain to readers, uh, which documents or real-world news events are being referred to.
[01:15:04.665 --> 01:15:11.512]  His most recent book, The Road to 9-11, from the University of California Press, details, with historical and geopolitical context, the events of 9-11.
[01:15:12.433 --> 01:15:14.395]  And, uh, it goes on from this.
[01:15:16.155 --> 01:15:18.756]  Professor Peter Del Scott, good to have you here with us today.
[01:15:19.197 --> 01:15:28.062]  I want to get your view on Obama, the people behind him, the overarching banking structure, what is at the heart from your research of the deep state, when Carol Quigley wrote about it, Georgetown.
[01:15:28.602 --> 01:15:40.108]  Then I want to get into kind of the left-wing management groups that manage the left, and how they control the anti-war movement, and some of the right-wing control groups as well, and how they kind of have that synthesis.
[01:15:40.208 --> 01:15:41.229]  It's good to have you here with us.
[01:15:41.929 --> 01:15:43.210]  I'm glad you're back on the show.
[01:15:44.154 --> 01:16:01.081]  You've given me a tall agenda there to deal with in one hour, but yes, I think that people are probably more aware now than they were a couple of years ago just how little wiggle room there is in American politics.
[01:16:01.161 --> 01:16:12.465]  We had a huge bailout for the banks when Bush was president, and now we have a new president, and we have another huge bailout that looks remarkably like the first one.
[01:16:13.123 --> 01:16:23.791]  Which seems to validate what Gore Vidal said once, you know, that we have only one political party in this country, the Property Party, with two right wings.
[01:16:24.331 --> 01:16:40.824]  Both parties, I think, are very indebted to the money that gets them elected, and that money comes from the same sources for both parties, the big oil companies, the big banks, the whole, what's now called the Petroleum Financial Military Complex.
[01:16:41.664 --> 01:16:47.426]  That has really been taxing this country for its own ends since World War II.
[01:16:49.747 --> 01:16:50.467]  Please continue.
[01:16:51.808 --> 01:17:10.315]  Well, when we talk about one party with two right wings, for a long time people thought, and there was some truth, that the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, representing Wall Street banks and law firms,
[01:17:10.922 --> 01:17:13.204]  Was the real power in determining U.S.
[01:17:13.224 --> 01:17:37.340]  foreign policy and, you know, as evidence for that, you could point to the fact that it was really they who pushed Truman into creating a CIA, which, back in 1947, which was then populated at the top, I think of the seven known deputy directors of the CIA in its first two years,
[01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:42.573]  All but one were from Wall Street banks and firms.
[01:17:43.294 --> 01:17:57.104]  And in addition to that, they were also, all but one of those were from the New York Social Register, the kind of high society that represented the real wealth of New York.
[01:17:58.545 --> 01:18:06.051]  Now, the CFR doesn't have the power now that it used to have then, and that's largely because of the Reagan Revolution.
[01:18:06.698 --> 01:18:23.522]  And what I say in my book is a real power grab that happened really under Ford in 1975 when Cheney and Rumsfeld, two names that were being very powerful in American politics from the time that they were both in Ford's White House.
[01:18:23.682 --> 01:18:32.985]  That's right, they were there when the National Security Dictatorship said their Continuity of Government, this is our chance to take over and we saw them pretty much try to repeat that under Bush, didn't we?
[01:18:33.479 --> 01:18:38.481]  Yeah, well, they planned for the whole continuity of government.
[01:18:39.161 --> 01:18:55.508]  It's not surprising they were doing it under Reagan, although it's a little surprising because Rumsfeld wasn't in the government, but he still was empowered by a secret Reagan executive order to plan, essentially, for a suspension of the Constitution.
[01:18:56.088 --> 01:18:59.149]  It's really remarkable that two of them kept on planning.
[01:19:00.167 --> 01:19:13.515]  Right through the 90s, and in the second half of the 90s, neither Cheney nor Rumsfeld was in the government, and you had a Democratic president who, according to Andrew Coburn, didn't have only the vaguest idea of what was going on.
[01:19:14.035 --> 01:19:25.881]  They were planning for all these big changes we've seen since 9-11, and neither of them was in the government, and this was all empowered by a Reagan executive order back in 1981.
[01:19:27.389 --> 01:19:46.220]  So there is a good way of seeing how what's going on on the surface is really being subordinated to other forces not visible that have only the flimsiest of constitutional authorizations that trump the Constitution.
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:49.501]  Because, you know, we've seen the suspension of habeas corpus.
[01:19:50.022 --> 01:19:53.924]  We've seen the preparations for martial law in a very big way.
[01:19:54.531 --> 01:20:02.694]  And all of these major, major changes were not debated through Congress or even through the normal executive.
[01:20:03.194 --> 01:20:12.297]  It was done by what you like to call a shadow government, a special committee that was secretly authorized by Reagan back in 1981.
[01:20:16.692 --> 01:20:16.892]  Sure.
[01:20:16.952 --> 01:20:18.834]  You want me to go on a bit more?
[01:20:18.854 --> 01:20:24.400]  Yeah, continue, because now the deep state is openly becoming the entire state.
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:27.724]  It looks like Obama's lockstep with P.E.D.
[01:20:27.744 --> 01:20:35.833]  51, John Warren Defense Authorization Act, the announcement of 20,000 battle-hardened troops to be on the streets of America, suddenly Marines are at DWI checkpoints.
[01:20:36.792 --> 01:20:55.543]  We're putting liaison officers into the police departments, and Congress isn't allowed to see PD-51, though the cover sheet basically says the President's a dictator, and now, I wanted to get your take on a few weeks ago, the John Yoo memos come out, one good thing that President Obama's done, and it says what we already knew.
[01:20:55.603 --> 01:21:00.827]  They wanted to get rid of free speech, they said the President's basically a dictator, and that that's constitutional.
[01:21:00.847 --> 01:21:01.187]  Go ahead.
[01:21:01.892 --> 01:21:02.092]  Yes.
[01:21:02.613 --> 01:21:15.742]  Well, um, you know, there's a bunch of, I'm not alone in being upset about constitutional, uh, what they call continuity of government, COG, which I insist we should call change of government.
[01:21:16.583 --> 01:21:24.688]  Uh, we, we are in still in a state of emergency, which was declared officially, uh, three days after 9 11.
[01:21:26.004 --> 01:21:39.073]  There is actually a statute that requires Congress to review every proclamation of an emergency within six months and to decide whether to allow it to stand or to get rid of it.
[01:21:39.894 --> 01:21:49.861]  And for about two years now, I've been appealing to the Democrats in Congress to do their statutory requirement and conduct that review.
[01:21:50.061 --> 01:21:51.882]  And since Obama was elected,
[01:21:52.969 --> 01:22:07.913]  Dan Hamburg, he's a former congressman, and I have written to the Obama White House, and we've written to Nancy Pelosi, and we've used all the back channels that we know of, which are not very many in my case.
[01:22:08.033 --> 01:22:11.054]  I have written to somebody who speaks to Dennis Kucinich.
[01:22:11.734 --> 01:22:18.716]  I think all these people do what the law says you have to do, and look at the state of emergency
[01:22:19.344 --> 01:22:22.905]  And either publicly affirm it or get rid of it.
[01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:34.030]  In that case, that would sweep away the foundation for all these secret mammals which Congress ought to be able to see but hasn't been allowed to look at.
[01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:36.330]  Let me bring a microcosm up of that.
[01:22:36.791 --> 01:22:40.912]  The Delta Force has been operating really since the 60s, but they publicly founded it in 1980, in December.
[01:22:44.864 --> 01:22:55.774]  And we heard this week from Sy Hersh and MSNBC with Oberman, a secret death squad operating in the U.S., spying but killing people overseas, outside the CIA's control.
[01:22:56.334 --> 01:22:58.336]  And then it mentioned it was the Delta Force.
[01:22:58.876 --> 01:23:00.498]  Well, Obama's continuing that.
[01:23:00.518 --> 01:23:01.839]  It was going on before Bush.
[01:23:01.899 --> 01:23:08.865]  By making it just about Bush, people think, oh, this is all over, but that's the deep... No, no, it's older than Bush, and we still have it.
[01:23:08.965 --> 01:23:09.746]  It's JSOC.
[01:23:10.536 --> 01:23:27.820]  And, uh, I've been around for a while, so I remember, you know, I actually went to Washington to investigate these things, worked for a think tank in 1987, and we were very considered about this Joint Special Operations Command, which the Delta Force is under.
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:36.922]  Uh, that was set up in the 1980s, and they were doing all kinds of shady things then, and I was particularly trying to
[01:23:37.885 --> 01:23:50.213]  Uh, pinpoint or pin down the rumors that we kept hearing over and over that this had to do with the flow of drugs into the country, which was, you know, a tremendous problem then and still is.
[01:23:50.233 --> 01:23:51.894]  It was really acute then.
[01:23:51.914 --> 01:24:02.221]  Uh, we, you know, we had the cocaine epidemics that turned into the crack epidemic and it was so much of it was as a result of what the CIA was doing.
[01:24:02.617 --> 01:24:28.922]  It's now official that in the first year that the CIA started operations in Afghanistan back in 1980, within months, certainly within that year, we went from virtually no heroin coming from that part of the world to the United States, to 40% of our heroin coming from that part of the world to the United States.
[01:24:29.522 --> 01:24:41.575]  No, and it's very striking right now that we can't get the people who are in Afghanistan to target the big drug lords.
[01:24:43.337 --> 01:24:47.622]  Drug refineries, they process the heroin right there in Afghanistan.
[01:24:48.406 --> 01:24:49.847]  In Afghanistan.
[01:25:05.874 --> 01:25:10.336]  The British and the Americans see it differently because most of that heroin is going to Europe and to Britain.
[01:25:29.574 --> 01:25:30.134]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:25:30.174 --> 01:25:38.097]  Let's continue with the Deep State, Obama, who's behind him, and then let's get into some of the groups that you write about and talk about.
[01:25:38.117 --> 01:25:42.619]  Specifically, I've had listeners ask me about this, that are controlling right-wing groups and left-wing groups.
[01:25:43.199 --> 01:25:46.440]  So, some more of the structure of the shadow government.
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:47.420]  Stay with us.
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:48.381]  Peter Dell Scott's our guest.
[01:25:49.591 --> 01:25:50.772]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:25:50.952 --> 01:25:53.214]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[01:25:53.354 --> 01:25:57.376]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[01:25:57.516 --> 01:25:59.578]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[01:26:04.291 --> 01:26:13.478]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[01:26:13.678 --> 01:26:19.822]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoodsDirect.
[01:26:20.063 --> 01:26:23.465]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[01:26:23.665 --> 01:26:27.868]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoodsDirect.
[01:26:28.068 --> 01:26:29.149]  For the rest of you, go to
[01:26:36.394 --> 01:26:40.138]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:26:55.931 --> 01:27:01.274]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:27:01.814 --> 01:27:08.018]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:27:08.318 --> 01:27:10.139]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:27:10.299 --> 01:27:12.680]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:23.646]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:27:25.934 --> 01:27:27.195]  It's not about left or right.
[01:27:27.595 --> 01:27:28.997]  It's about a one world government.
[01:27:29.457 --> 01:27:35.762]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:45.771]  The Obama Deception.
[01:27:46.211 --> 01:27:47.472]  The people strike back.
[01:27:49.834 --> 01:27:51.976]  Peter Kranschnabel here from Midas Resources.
[01:27:52.276 --> 01:27:54.678]  Are you concerned about uncontrollable government spending?
[01:27:55.262 --> 01:27:57.144]  A banking system on the verge of collapse?
[01:27:57.744 --> 01:27:59.625]  Banks on the edge of being nationalized?
[01:28:00.166 --> 01:28:02.047]  Wall Street and continuous free fall?
[01:28:02.648 --> 01:28:04.970]  Scandal after scandal with hedge funds companies?
[01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:10.394]  If protecting your hard-earned savings or retirement fund is on your mind, the answer is simple.
[01:28:10.914 --> 01:28:13.436]  Secure your assets by purchasing gold and silver.
[01:28:13.977 --> 01:28:22.183]  Since President Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1971, the United States has been operating the longest-running fiat currency in the history of mankind.
[01:28:22.893 --> 01:28:25.974]  Gold has held its purchasing power for over 6,000 years.
[01:28:26.455 --> 01:28:29.416]  Contact me, Peter Kronschnabel, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:28:29.456 --> 01:28:32.317]  Once again, that's Peter at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:28:32.377 --> 01:28:33.758]  While you can still purchase gold with paper.
[01:28:33.798 --> 01:28:34.818]  That is 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:50.361]  Spring is here.
[01:28:50.601 --> 01:28:51.382]  Growing season.
[01:28:51.562 --> 01:28:53.564]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:28:53.764 --> 01:28:55.186]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:28:55.486 --> 01:28:56.147]  Think about it.
[01:28:56.447 --> 01:29:00.311]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:29:00.551 --> 01:29:04.034]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:29:04.295 --> 01:29:05.916]  The country is running out of food.
[01:29:06.196 --> 01:29:08.759]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:29:09.019 --> 01:29:10.821]  At OrganicaSeed.com,

[01:29:58.713 --> 01:30:03.898]  In 1814, we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[01:30:04.198 --> 01:30:09.382]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[01:30:09.603 --> 01:30:12.145]  We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'.
[01:30:12.345 --> 01:30:13.386]  We are back live.
[01:30:13.406 --> 01:30:16.388]  Professor Peter L. Scott, author, researcher, is our guest.
[01:30:16.429 --> 01:30:17.529]  This is a short segment.
[01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:20.072]  Peter, from your deep research, let's just cut right to the chase.
[01:30:20.572 --> 01:30:24.113]  Well, let me begin with a quote from Franklin Roosevelt back in 1933, which I believe is still true
[01:30:47.162 --> 01:30:51.567]  And very visibly demonstrated in the last six months with the bailouts.
[01:30:52.788 --> 01:31:09.004]  This was in a private letter of Roosevelt to a close friend, Colonel House, and he said, the real truth is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson.
[01:31:09.795 --> 01:31:17.660]  Well, you know, I used to teach political science, and we never taught this, and I left political science because they don't address this fundamental fact.
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:22.103]  So, you know, a Marxist would say, ah, yes, there's a ruling class.
[01:31:22.723 --> 01:31:38.413]  But I think the Marxists don't understand it properly either, because he said in the larger centers, New York, of course, was the dominant center, and still is to some extent.
[01:31:38.948 --> 01:32:00.377]  And that's why I was talking about the Council on Foreign Relations before, but we've seen a lot of new wealth come up in Houston and Dallas and Los Angeles, and in 1980 there was the creation of a group which was consciously designed to combat the influence of the CFR, and that's called the Council
[01:32:01.521 --> 01:32:03.442]  For national policy.
[01:32:03.923 --> 01:32:18.410]  They resented the connections of the banks in New York to the international globe, global financial network, and they wanted one which would be more nationalistic in its approaches.
[01:32:19.271 --> 01:32:28.836]  And the people who financed that creation of the CNP, as we call it, as opposed to CFR, are people like Richard Mellonscape,
[01:32:29.352 --> 01:32:29.793]  We're good.
[01:32:49.329 --> 01:32:51.430]  It had it's own international connections.
[01:33:08.698 --> 01:33:12.220]  That that's their way to co-op conservative movements and control it.
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:16.041]  I mean, are you saying the Moonies and groups like this are at the top?
[01:33:16.081 --> 01:33:32.667]  Because we see the international bankers openly taking everything over right now, and I just see liberal control arms, Ford Foundation over the liberals, and Rockefeller Foundation and others, and then the group you're talking about and some others that are, you know, trying to control and influence what would be seen as the right wing.
[01:33:33.803 --> 01:33:36.965]  Well, you know, we live in an imperfect world.
[01:33:37.265 --> 01:33:45.949]  By the way, when I listen to all those anti-Obama ads, I think we have to see what Obama's going to do.
[01:33:46.049 --> 01:33:55.614]  Because, you know, in 1932, when Roosevelt was elected, a lot of people would have said, ah, there's the New York ruling class asserting themselves again.
[01:33:56.753 --> 01:34:05.076]  Roosevelt, although there was a limit to what he could do, certainly did enough to mightily offend the financial elements.
[01:34:05.356 --> 01:34:12.158]  And we do know that fascist interest in the McCormick-Dickstein committees covered this, tried to overthrow him and Smedley Butler blew the whistle.
[01:34:12.198 --> 01:34:13.899]  So that does show there's infighting.
[01:34:14.639 --> 01:34:16.179]  Smedley Butler, exactly.
[01:34:16.219 --> 01:34:20.841]  And those were, you know, DuPont and Morgan people behind Smedley Butler.
[01:34:21.648 --> 01:34:27.273]  I wonder if everybody in this audience knows that there was an attempt to mount a military coup in 1935.
[01:34:27.793 --> 01:34:29.814]  It didn't go anywhere.
[01:34:30.135 --> 01:34:36.720]  This is a much healthier country, actually, than one might think just by reading the headlines right now.
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:38.581]  We have some very major problems.
[01:34:39.161 --> 01:34:43.124]  But I'm prepared to wait and see what Obama's going to do.
[01:34:43.144 --> 01:34:49.049]  But also, I'm quite certain in my own mind that Obama got where he got because
[01:34:49.642 --> 01:34:58.404]  Some of the moneyed elements in America backed him from the very beginning, and I think we can talk specifically about the Pritzker family.
[01:34:59.804 --> 01:35:16.887]  I've written about... If you go to my website, www.peterdalescott.net, I have some rather nasty things to say about the Pritzkers, and yet there was Penny Pritzker, who was the treasurer of the Obama campaign, until her connection to the subprime
[01:35:17.595 --> 01:35:19.076]  We're on the march.
[01:35:19.196 --> 01:35:20.497]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:35:21.098 --> 01:35:24.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:49.870 --> 01:35:53.275]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:35:53.395 --> 01:35:58.622]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:35:58.802 --> 01:36:03.508]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:36:04.810 --> 01:36:15.113]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[01:36:15.473 --> 01:36:21.014]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:36:21.234 --> 01:36:27.316]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:36:27.516 --> 01:36:28.176]  What about you?
[01:36:28.536 --> 01:36:32.537]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:36:49.726 --> 01:36:55.049]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:36:55.529 --> 01:37:02.513]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:37:03.118 --> 01:37:09.305]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:37:09.705 --> 01:37:11.527]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:37:11.667 --> 01:37:14.090]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:37:14.170 --> 01:37:25.122]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:37:25.746 --> 01:37:27.027]  It's not about left or right.
[01:37:27.407 --> 01:37:28.829]  It's about a one world government.

[01:37:44.441 --> 01:37:45.602]  The Obama Deception.
[01:37:46.022 --> 01:37:47.223]  The people strike back.
[01:37:49.022 --> 01:37:57.413]  There is growing evidence that Americans would have better health and a lower incidence of cancer and fibrocystic disease of the breast if they consumed more iodine.
[01:37:57.493 --> 01:38:03.882]  Neutriodine iodine is formulated to work with your body to help to stimulate proper hormonal balance and can
[01:38:04.022 --> 01:38:04.742]  We're good to go!
[01:38:33.097 --> 01:38:33.297]  Yes.
[01:38:55.287 --> 01:38:58.809]  Well, first of all, that kind of split would be there with or without the CFR and the CNP.
[01:38:58.829 --> 01:39:04.333]  If you go back before the war, in the days of the National Association of Manufacturers,
[01:39:21.638 --> 01:39:35.005]  They represented what you might call homegrown industry that was not interested in exports, was interested in the local economy, and was very mistrustful of the banking connections in New York.
[01:39:35.706 --> 01:39:51.254]  And it's out of the NAM, the National Association of Manufacturers, that you got the John Birch Society, which was, you know, it was always depicted in the, what you might call the CFR-controlled big media as being a kooky organization.
[01:39:51.670 --> 01:39:58.811]  But they were powerful, because they had roots not just in what was left of the NAM, but also in the military.
[01:39:58.851 --> 01:40:00.992]  They were at quite a high level in the military.
[01:40:01.052 --> 01:40:10.354]  People like General Walker and so on were indoctrinating their troops with John Birch material, and we have the legacy of that today.
[01:40:10.454 --> 01:40:18.075]  That tradition is what produced the CNP, the Council on National Policy, in Dallas in 1980.
[01:40:18.435 --> 01:40:20.776]  You mentioned yourself, The Hunt.
[01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:26.783]  Let's take the current generation, where they're dying off now.
[01:40:27.363 --> 01:40:33.566]  Nelson Bunker Hunt had financed the John Birch Society.
[01:40:33.586 --> 01:40:45.253]  He had paid for the ad that attacked Kennedy on the day he came to Dallas in 1963, that fateful day, and he was one of the big sources of money for
[01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:48.161]  The Council on National Policy.
[01:40:48.221 --> 01:41:02.431]  In other words, Richard Mellonscape, who's a grandson of Andrew Mellon, the very wealthy, the Mellons were extremely wealthy from Gulf oil, but they also controlled Alcoa, and uh, the Bank.
[01:41:04.853 --> 01:41:11.958]  You have these different powerful groups, so that you can't just, and this is where I disagree with Mellon Chomsky, for example.
[01:41:11.978 --> 01:41:14.280]  He thinks that America is a great big system,
[01:41:14.881 --> 01:41:23.263]  Devoted to exploiting the rest of the world, I see Washington as being a cockpit between competing interests.
[01:41:23.323 --> 01:41:28.004]  Let's use the United States as an engine for their operations globally.
[01:41:28.024 --> 01:41:30.804]  We were already incredibly wealthy before these elites take over.
[01:41:30.824 --> 01:41:33.665]  They always act like America stole everything it's got.
[01:41:33.725 --> 01:41:38.926]  No, really, we've seen our, in my opinion, long decline since we became an empire.
[01:41:38.946 --> 01:41:39.826]  Do you agree with that statement?
[01:41:41.028 --> 01:41:41.888]  I can't assess it.
[01:41:41.968 --> 01:41:44.709]  I mean, there are visible sources of decline.
[01:41:44.929 --> 01:41:46.070]  Well, I mean, let's assess this.
[01:41:46.330 --> 01:41:47.510]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:58.673]  Well, I'll just say, you know, a little earlier, we've been living on a fiat currency ever since Nixon went off the gold standard.
[01:41:59.353 --> 01:42:07.076]  But, you know, I think that's where there's an argument, and it would be a CNP argument, for maintaining a very strong military.
[01:42:08.703 --> 01:42:11.024]  Well, you have maintained a very strong military.
[01:42:11.144 --> 01:42:17.868]  People are nervous about challenging the use of the American currency.
[01:42:19.196 --> 01:42:22.118]  as the currency that oil deals with.
[01:42:22.158 --> 01:42:23.279]  No, I understand all that.
[01:42:23.299 --> 01:42:35.069]  You know, my whole issue is, other people call in and ask me, you know what the CNP is, and I've heard of it, and I know it's a bunch of kind of fake right-wingers that, you know, meet and have these dinners and things, and I know there's a lot of... I don't think they're fake.
[01:42:35.089 --> 01:42:38.972]  I think, you know, if they're fake, who are the real right-wingers?
[01:42:38.992 --> 01:42:42.474]  Well, see, I mean, I'm past this whole left-right thing.
[01:42:43.055 --> 01:42:47.638]  I see things as tyranny or liberty, and my whole issue with this is,
[01:42:48.877 --> 01:43:03.759]  I see the list of people that are involved in this group and I see them also involved in a lot of the other major groups and it's clear the international banking cartel is the top of the pyramid and I know that the Hunts and people because I remember reading stuff on the UT website there was a
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:06.662]  My take on that is, Alex, and you know
[01:43:32.203 --> 01:43:41.346]  I mean, part of me thinks the way you do, but part of me thinks that in order to be visible in this struggle, you have to be powerful.
[01:43:41.746 --> 01:43:46.847]  And in order to be powerful, you have to have connections to the wealthy in this country.
[01:43:47.287 --> 01:43:56.950]  And once you start developing those connections, you start becoming co-opted into this whole system whereby wealth controls the politics of the country.
[01:43:57.386 --> 01:44:10.135]  So a true liberty party, you know, we've had some real libertarians in this country like Murray Rothbard and so on, but most people never heard of them because they, and even he, had wealthy connections.
[01:44:11.156 --> 01:44:16.720]  Somebody like me, I swear to God, I don't have any connection to wealth.
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:20.983]  I also have no visibility in this country except on your show.
[01:44:22.007 --> 01:44:31.673]  Because to be visible in this country, you somehow have to fit into this system, whether you're at the CFR side of it or the left.
[01:44:31.693 --> 01:44:33.234]  But the internet is changing that.
[01:44:33.554 --> 01:44:35.155]  Yes, it is.
[01:44:35.195 --> 01:44:36.316]  I mean, that's why we exist.
[01:44:36.336 --> 01:44:39.038]  But I'm trying to understand, because I really respect your research.
[01:44:39.378 --> 01:44:44.021]  You know, you're absolutely right about the Delta Force and the command above it.
[01:44:44.481 --> 01:44:45.622]  Everything I read from you
[01:44:47.583 --> 01:44:55.955]  About 98% of it is stuff I already discovered on my own, and then you take it many times a level deeper, and then I research it and find out you're accurate.
[01:44:55.975 --> 01:45:01.943]  So I really respect you, and I'm trying to learn your perspective on this.
[01:45:02.103 --> 01:45:03.265]  My whole issue is...
[01:45:06.016 --> 01:45:16.900]  Is that, you know, if things like the CNP are so powerful, then why did George Bush, who I guess some would say was involved in this, why would he triple the size of government?
[01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:24.262]  I mean, if these guys are so powerful, why are they wrecking the country if they really are these hardcore right-wingers that are pro-America?
[01:45:24.282 --> 01:45:27.403]  I mean, I'm trying to... Okay, let me just address that.
[01:45:27.824 --> 01:45:31.745]  The Hunt brother that George W. Bush is close to
[01:45:32.592 --> 01:45:38.333]  is the Ray Hunt, who doesn't really share the politics of his two brothers.
[01:45:38.453 --> 01:45:39.893]  They're half-brothers, by the way.
[01:45:40.533 --> 01:45:46.814]  He's the son from a later marriage, and I would not classify Ray Hunt as being CNP.
[01:45:46.855 --> 01:45:56.476]  I would classify him as being Texas mega-rich, the Sunbelt faction in the ruling class.
[01:45:57.816 --> 01:46:00.697]  George W. Bush, I think, is mostly indebted to...
[01:46:01.781 --> 01:46:17.270]  You should, Bob, people should, if they're interested in this, get my friend Russ Baker's book, Family of Secrets, and he goes at great length into who funded George W. Bush's little oil company, Arbusto, as it grew and grew and grew.
[01:46:17.290 --> 01:46:21.732]  Well, isn't that CIA connected, and then Skull and Bones, I thought, is Bush's main power.
[01:46:22.173 --> 01:46:25.154]  Well, yeah, but you know, there's a lot of Texas in Skull and Bones.
[01:46:25.594 --> 01:46:26.194]  No, I know.
[01:46:26.554 --> 01:46:32.156]  Are you saying you believe that the C&P thing is the top of the pyramid?
[01:46:32.536 --> 01:46:32.816]  No.
[01:46:34.357 --> 01:46:35.877]  Actually, I don't think it's a pyramid.
[01:46:35.917 --> 01:46:36.797]  Let's start there.
[01:46:36.817 --> 01:46:41.799]  I think these things go up into a kind of... Bipolar?
[01:46:42.319 --> 01:46:42.899]  Multi-polar?
[01:46:45.362 --> 01:46:49.244]  So much infighting going on that nobody's at the top.
[01:46:49.364 --> 01:46:57.688]  And specifically, Alex, I think one of the places you and I disagree most is that we both think this is a basically healthy country.
[01:46:58.188 --> 01:47:08.492]  But where we differ is that you try to localize the source of the evil in the international bankers and something outside the country.
[01:47:08.993 --> 01:47:09.573]  I don't think
[01:47:10.169 --> 01:47:20.654]  I think that the international banking system, as it's called, that we now have, was first of all the creation of Britain, and then after that, of the United States.
[01:47:20.774 --> 01:47:25.017]  The hard core of the international banking system is the US and England.
[01:47:25.177 --> 01:47:26.217]  England, America.
[01:47:26.397 --> 01:47:27.758]  London and New York.
[01:47:28.377 --> 01:47:32.239]  And we cannot blame everything that's wrong with the country.
[01:47:32.299 --> 01:47:33.899]  Peter, you misunderstand my position.
[01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:48.286]  I mean, I agree it's the Anglo-American establishment, the United States and England are the international banking cartel or the dominant force, but it's allied with some European factions, so I'm not disagreeing with you there.
[01:47:48.306 --> 01:47:50.647]  Well, how about the moral tone of it?
[01:47:50.687 --> 01:47:53.708]  Because I don't see them as being inherently evil.
[01:47:54.093 --> 01:47:56.876]  For example, I hate war.
[01:47:57.336 --> 01:48:02.141]  I've spent my life fighting the wars that have happened in my adulthood.
[01:48:02.679 --> 01:48:11.067]  But when the Anglo-American establishment united to stop Hitler, I think that was probably a good thing.
[01:48:11.167 --> 01:48:18.254]  What about the Milner Group wanting to fund a fascist movement in Germany to counterbalance the communist move?
[01:48:18.594 --> 01:48:20.095]  And then you have here in the U.S.
[01:48:20.136 --> 01:48:25.441]  all the big, and that goes back to the right-wing faction, trying to fund Hitler and him funding them here.
[01:48:25.561 --> 01:48:26.702]  So again, we come back
[01:48:27.142 --> 01:48:32.725]  These are splits which separated John Foster Dulles from his brother Alan Dulles.
[01:48:47.691 --> 01:48:52.596]  So obviously, it's not one, you know, everything perfectly scientifically oiled together.
[01:48:52.976 --> 01:49:02.485]  It's these big corrupt elites and their think tanks and their systems of control and their propaganda arms just expanding power and destroying the middle class and impoverishing the planet.
[01:49:02.525 --> 01:49:06.369]  I mean, it's like, you know, Mexico's one elite, but it works with the U.S.
[01:49:06.409 --> 01:49:07.029]  elite.
[01:49:07.089 --> 01:49:08.571]  I mean, so that's what I believe.
[01:49:09.434 --> 01:49:29.198]  Well, let's talk a bit about Mexico, because now you have essentially a dozen or so super-rich people, many of whom got rich on the drug traffic, and they really do work as a unit and meet together to pool their money to back a candidate for the next president.
[01:49:29.658 --> 01:49:31.578]  That's not my model for America.
[01:49:32.079 --> 01:49:39.180]  I think that there is more confusion than that in America, and that's why we have, you know, let's face it, we have a healthier
[01:49:40.084 --> 01:49:43.026]  political society in America than you have in Mexico.
[01:49:43.106 --> 01:49:48.289]  And that goes back to the separation of powers that the founders set up to tie down dominant men.
[01:49:48.750 --> 01:49:49.330]  Hear, hear.
[01:49:49.650 --> 01:49:51.752]  And that is very threatened right now.
[01:49:51.812 --> 01:50:00.897]  That is what I've, on my website, I've been doing these various things to see, and you know where you brought up the John Yoo memos and so on.
[01:50:01.338 --> 01:50:06.281]  I think to get to restoration of real separation of powers and
[01:50:07.263 --> 01:50:11.447]  Restoration of constitutional primacy over everything else.
[01:50:11.988 --> 01:50:20.956]  We have to undo this idea that we're at war against, you know, terrorists who are as powerful as we are.
[01:50:21.417 --> 01:50:30.165]  Our Constitution is our best defense and somehow we've got to get Congress to reassert its primacy and to reassert their rights and to end this
[01:50:30.959 --> 01:50:37.622]  They're required by law to examine this thing and yet they haven't done it.
[01:50:43.126 --> 01:51:07.715]  My dad called me one morning, he saw it too, a separate year, and they go, you know, Madam Speaker, Speaker, I have a message from the President of the United States, and he brings in the message of the emergency, and then they pass it through, or they agree to it, so you're right, we've been living under the state of emergency for a long time, and we've got to... Alex, you know, I may be wrong on this, because I haven't really researched it, but I was going to write about that, and then someone assured me
[01:51:08.436 --> 01:51:08.716]  That's
[01:51:22.341 --> 01:51:27.504]  The national state of emergency that we've had since... No, no, I've seen them bring it in.
[01:51:27.524 --> 01:51:32.186]  No, no, I understand separately they call it martial law in Congress when some of the rules are suspended.
[01:51:32.206 --> 01:51:39.470]  I mean, there's a lot of different systems, but then separately... No, we're getting martial law in this country and very elaborate preparations for it.
[01:51:40.171 --> 01:51:46.114]  And it's not just this country because Canada's army now is pretty well melded into the American one.
[01:51:46.174 --> 01:51:51.797]  And Canada is also... We never had a Posse Comest Tattoos Act in Canada.
[01:51:52.304 --> 01:51:55.786]  But we do have a tradition of doing things through Parliament.
[01:51:56.147 --> 01:51:58.008]  Well, Peter, briefly, briefly.
[01:51:58.528 --> 01:51:59.109]  Sure, sure.
[01:51:59.349 --> 01:52:01.090]  And I keep interrupting because we have limited time here.
[01:52:01.110 --> 01:52:02.171]  I'm going to have to have you back up.
[01:52:02.191 --> 01:52:04.252]  We'll do it maybe for a couple hours and really break all this down.
[01:52:04.633 --> 01:52:06.454]  Specifically, I've had listeners ask me about it.
[01:52:07.415 --> 01:52:09.356]  I know some about the CNP.
[01:52:09.636 --> 01:52:11.357]  Tell me who's in that now and what it's doing.
[01:52:12.899 --> 01:52:15.320]  Oh, you know, I'm an old man.
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:18.062]  I can tell you who was in it at the beginning.
[01:52:18.102 --> 01:52:19.623]  It was the Coons family.
[01:52:19.703 --> 01:52:21.885]  It was Richard Mellon Scaife.
[01:52:22.523 --> 01:52:38.598]  It was, um, there is a website, you know, if people have a computer, they can Google for Council on National Policy and you'll get a very big website that gives you all the members that are known.
[01:52:38.638 --> 01:52:39.859]  By the way, it's very secret.
[01:52:41.961 --> 01:52:47.266]  They don't publish any of their findings, as opposed to the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:52:47.836 --> 01:52:48.297]  We're good.
[01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:09.284]  It's a lot of the people who are involved in the radical religious right.
[01:53:10.565 --> 01:53:12.427]  The Blackwater guy's in it too, isn't he?
[01:53:12.947 --> 01:53:14.088]  I think so, yes.
[01:53:14.288 --> 01:53:20.133]  And he's now converted to Catholicism, and people are saying... How does the Catholic Church in Israel play into this?
[01:53:20.153 --> 01:53:21.394]  Because I get that question all the time.
[01:53:21.434 --> 01:53:22.415]  What's your view on those groups?
[01:53:22.736 --> 01:53:28.320]  Well, again, the Catholic Church is very much a mixture of different forces.
[01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:31.063]  You know, there have been, I think, the leading
[01:53:31.822 --> 01:53:32.023]  I think so.
[01:53:46.107 --> 01:53:48.928]  You know what Alex, I think any big organization is going to have a lot of corruption in it.
[01:53:48.948 --> 01:53:50.889]  That includes the American government and the Catholic Church.
[01:54:06.573 --> 01:54:08.354]  They also can have a lot of good in them.
[01:54:09.074 --> 01:54:13.856]  I just want your view because listeners, they obsess on groups.
[01:54:14.216 --> 01:54:15.756]  So if people want that, we'll do it.
[01:54:15.836 --> 01:54:16.717]  And I respect you.
[01:54:16.737 --> 01:54:19.038]  I want your view on CMP, Catholic Church.
[01:54:19.078 --> 01:54:20.258]  What about Israel?
[01:54:20.618 --> 01:54:22.579]  Where is it in the power structure from your research?
[01:54:22.779 --> 01:54:33.683]  Well, Israel at this point is so embattled that, you know, it began as a quite progressive, left of center, secular state.
[01:54:34.258 --> 01:54:37.359]  It's become completely changed over the years.
[01:54:38.199 --> 01:54:41.160]  The disaster for Israel was in 1967.
[01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:45.941]  Whether or not they were right temporarily to occupy the West Bank.
[01:54:46.381 --> 01:54:53.823]  They should have got out of it immediately and a lot of very sane heads at the top of Israel's government said we must do that.
[01:54:54.343 --> 01:54:58.184]  Well they haven't and since then they've been in a virtual state of siege.
[01:54:58.964 --> 01:55:03.085]  And I was in Israel a little over a year ago
[01:55:03.701 --> 01:55:19.365]  Everybody I met were, individually, they were charming people, but their ideas, they fear peace at this point more than they fear war, because they know if they have peace, they're going to have to give that land back, and they don't know how to do that.
[01:55:19.485 --> 01:55:21.126]  So it's a perpetual state of war.
[01:55:21.146 --> 01:55:30.708]  And I have read to some extent, you know, there was a right-winger called Harry Elmer Barnes in the 50s, and he wrote a book
[01:55:31.015 --> 01:55:31.075]  No.
[01:55:31.095 --> 01:55:31.135]  No.
[01:55:48.018 --> 01:55:52.019]  And we have to invent enemies for it, like Osama Bin Laden in a cave.
[01:56:10.083 --> 01:56:21.011]  relationship between the Likudniks and the CNP people and they are in a lot of key areas of government and I agree it's a way over representation.
[01:56:21.831 --> 01:56:37.923]  And some of that sheer madness because of what's in the book of Revelation you know that these Christian right people who are trying to breed a red heifer because that's what in the Old Testament is going to be a sign of the Messiah
[01:56:39.033 --> 01:56:43.754]  This is what you call rational representation of financial interest.
[01:56:43.774 --> 01:56:44.534]  Peter, we've got a break.
[01:56:44.914 --> 01:56:45.775]  The break's going to cut you off.
[01:56:45.795 --> 01:56:46.395]  Final segment.
[01:56:46.415 --> 01:56:47.535]  Peter Del Scott, stay with us.
[01:56:49.475 --> 01:56:50.736]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:56:50.796 --> 01:56:56.137]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:56:56.377 --> 01:57:00.998]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:57:01.398 --> 01:57:01.778]  It's true.
[01:57:01.878 --> 01:57:04.439]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:57:04.679 --> 01:57:06.399]  And it's possible that it could even happen again.
[01:57:06.966 --> 01:57:11.667]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:57:12.187 --> 01:57:14.108]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:57:14.488 --> 01:57:19.109]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:57:19.289 --> 01:57:20.189]  And here's the best part.
[01:57:20.409 --> 01:57:23.190]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:57:23.490 --> 01:57:26.791]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:57:27.111 --> 01:57:29.951]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:57:30.292 --> 01:57:32.192]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:57:32.512 --> 01:57:33.432]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:57:37.173 --> 01:57:40.794]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:57:41.314 --> 01:57:45.815]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:57:46.135 --> 01:57:48.576]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:57:50.077 --> 01:57:55.318]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:57:56.099 --> 01:58:01.443]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:58:01.983 --> 01:58:08.188]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:58:08.468 --> 01:58:10.289]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:58:10.469 --> 01:58:12.871]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:58:12.911 --> 01:58:23.799]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:58:26.087 --> 01:58:27.348]  It's not about left or right.
[01:58:27.769 --> 01:58:29.150]  It's about a one world government.
[01:58:29.630 --> 01:58:35.936]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:58:36.537 --> 01:58:44.304]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:44.804 --> 01:58:45.945]  The Obama Deception.
[01:58:46.366 --> 01:58:47.567]  The people strike back.
[01:58:49.364 --> 01:58:52.627]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:58:52.807 --> 01:58:56.890]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:58:57.050 --> 01:59:05.036]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[01:59:05.316 --> 01:59:05.736]  We're good to go!
[01:59:35.196 --> 01:59:35.877]  We're good.
[01:59:51.505 --> 01:59:52.946]  Alright, we're basically out of time.
[01:59:52.966 --> 01:59:58.610]  I'm sorry I didn't have time to get to these calls, but I wanted to give Peter Del Scott as much time for us to discuss and go back and forth here.
[01:59:58.630 --> 02:00:00.671]  We'll have to have him back on as soon as we can do it.
[02:00:00.691 --> 02:00:01.492]  I know he's a busy man.
[02:00:02.512 --> 02:00:03.753]  PeterDelScott.net.
[02:00:04.214 --> 02:00:05.775]  PeterDelScott.net is the website.
[02:00:05.795 --> 02:00:13.440]  A lot of great books, very informative information, interesting perspective, and that's what I try to get is all views and perspectives here to get a clearer picture of what's going on in the world.
[02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:15.741]  Got about two minutes left, sir.
[02:00:15.761 --> 02:00:16.942]  Any closing information?
[02:00:16.962 --> 02:00:17.843]  You know, you're saying don't
[02:00:18.363 --> 02:00:19.684]  Judge Obama yet.
[02:00:19.884 --> 02:00:25.566]  I mean, I've seen, he says he's not doing CEO bonuses, but he writes a loophole in it.
[02:00:25.586 --> 02:00:26.827]  He says he's not going to hire lobbyists.
[02:00:26.847 --> 02:00:27.607]  That's all he does.
[02:00:28.047 --> 02:00:36.531]  All these Wall Street and banking people, all the Bush people, keeping the key neocon in there, you know, as Secretary of Defense.
[02:00:37.311 --> 02:00:39.572]  Talking about, you know, the CNP or whatever.
[02:00:39.612 --> 02:00:46.255]  I mean, it just, Obama, bad news in my book, and I've done the research, but you want to talk about that in closing?
[02:00:47.372 --> 02:01:01.621]  Well, what I'd like, I'd like to go back to what you said, you know, is now we have the Internet, you can be heard, you're a real force in this country, and even I can, readers can reach me through my website, and they learn about my books.
[02:01:01.741 --> 02:01:16.071]  The most important thing for the future of this country is to preserve the Internet, because there is, the mass media are more centralized now than they were 40 years ago, but it was a problem even then.
[02:01:16.661 --> 02:01:19.562]  And there's so many important things they just won't talk about.
[02:01:19.582 --> 02:01:20.063]  Yes.
[02:01:20.163 --> 02:01:26.685]  And we're talking about, you know, the populist reaction to the bank bailout.
[02:01:26.785 --> 02:01:36.930]  The New York Times writes about that as if this is kind of a dangerous phenomenon, whereas I think it's the health of the country that is protesting these bailouts.
[02:01:37.490 --> 02:01:41.232]  And so we need the Internet to do it, and we risk losing the Internet.
[02:01:41.292 --> 02:01:41.732]  That's right.
[02:01:42.376 --> 02:01:49.421]  And the COG, you know, they've had war games in which they were targeting bloggers.
[02:01:49.461 --> 02:01:52.083]  That was the official point of the program.
[02:01:52.484 --> 02:01:57.907]  They admit they have the Pentagon people out propagandizing on the web and the millions of dollars' worth.
[02:01:58.428 --> 02:01:58.688]  Right.
[02:01:58.808 --> 02:02:09.536]  Well, so I talk about this in my book, The Road to 9-11, and the last chapter tries to be optimistic, which I am some days, like today, but not always.
[02:02:11.258 --> 02:02:20.423]  And it all hangs on the internet and whether people can use it to mobilize a kind of common front.
[02:02:20.504 --> 02:02:21.284]  I agree with you.
[02:02:21.384 --> 02:02:25.647]  One that overcomes the artificial differences between left and right.
[02:02:25.687 --> 02:02:29.949]  They'll have to learn to give primacy to some different topics.
[02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:30.670]  I agree.
[02:02:30.690 --> 02:02:32.591]  Peter Del Scott, we're out of time.
[02:02:32.631 --> 02:02:36.413]  I want to invite you back in the near future to expand on your intriguing thoughts.
[02:02:36.473 --> 02:02:37.334]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:02:37.594 --> 02:02:38.154]  Thank you.
[02:02:38.234 --> 02:02:38.855]  I enjoyed this.
[02:02:39.255 --> 02:02:39.555]  You bet.
[02:02:39.595 --> 02:02:39.956]  Take care.
[02:02:39.976 --> 02:02:40.316]  There he goes.
[02:02:40.356 --> 02:02:41.297]  PeterDellScott.net.
[02:02:41.337 --> 02:02:45.501]  Now for the last minute and a half of the show, then it goes into retransmission with all the key info we covered today.
[02:02:46.021 --> 02:02:47.302]  I think a very informative show today.
[02:02:47.903 --> 02:02:52.407]  Ted Anderson, because gold shot up 30-something dollars today, it's only going to go up, folks.
[02:02:52.447 --> 02:02:54.749]  It could go down, but in the overall graph, it's going up.
[02:02:55.329 --> 02:02:58.292]  With the destruction of the dollar, the New World Order, all of this system.
[02:02:58.933 --> 02:03:01.535]  And Ted has got some amazing gold and silver deals for you today.
[02:03:01.555 --> 02:03:02.356]  I don't have much time.
[02:03:02.676 --> 02:03:04.118]  Ted, tell folks the offers.
[02:03:04.138 --> 02:03:07.121]  You've got gold prices, what, when it was 50, 60 bucks less?
[02:03:07.181 --> 02:03:10.624]  You've still got those offers for folks that want to take advantage of it on silver and gold.
[02:03:10.984 --> 02:03:13.367]  Yeah, you're right about that, Alex, because I have been buying.
[02:03:13.407 --> 02:03:15.189]  I do take advantage of the lower prices.
[02:03:15.249 --> 02:03:17.271]  Right now I do have the Frank at $218.
[02:03:17.331 --> 02:03:18.592]  I've got the British Sovereign at $272.
[02:03:20.611 --> 02:03:23.876]  I also have the Franklin Half Dollar at $8.69.
[02:03:35.575 --> 02:03:37.095]  The Fed's buying U.S.
[02:03:37.175 --> 02:03:37.656]  Treasuries.
[02:03:37.816 --> 02:03:41.197]  That's driving the stake further into the heart of the United States economy.
[02:03:41.217 --> 02:03:42.677]  So tell folks what you've got and give them the number.
[02:03:42.717 --> 02:03:45.138]  I mean, you bought this gold 50, 60 bucks less than it is now.
[02:03:45.398 --> 02:03:47.438]  You can pass that saving on right now, Ted.
[02:03:47.458 --> 02:03:47.978]  Give them the number.
[02:03:48.058 --> 02:03:48.238]  Yeah, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:03:48.258 --> 02:03:48.479]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:03:48.519 --> 02:03:50.439]  I'd suggest people get involved right now.
[02:03:57.642 --> 02:04:01.991]  And you've got, what, Franks and Sovereigns at that price?
[02:04:02.231 --> 02:04:04.156]  Yep, Franks, Sovereigns, all that stuff is discounted.
[02:04:04.176 --> 02:04:06.801]  And you're saying you've got some other stuff, folks, you just call and ask about it?
[02:04:07.506 --> 02:04:10.028]  Yep.
[02:04:10.048 --> 02:04:11.289]  800... 800-686-2237.
[02:04:11.309 --> 02:04:12.650]  You got some silver too, right, Ted?
[02:04:12.770 --> 02:04:12.950]  Yep.
[02:04:13.210 --> 02:04:13.930]  Silver as well.
[02:04:15.952 --> 02:04:16.272]  800... 800-686-2237.
[02:04:16.292 --> 02:04:21.936]  Folks, protect yourself today in this crazy economy.
[02:04:21.956 --> 02:04:22.216]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:22.236 --> 02:04:22.736]  Thank you, Ted.
[02:04:23.217 --> 02:04:23.757]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:04:24.077 --> 02:04:25.999]  We had a simulcast with Judge Napolitano.
[02:04:26.019 --> 02:04:26.719]  That's coming up.
[02:04:26.759 --> 02:04:28.901]  Stay with us back in one minute at InfoWars.com.
[02:04:29.021 --> 02:04:29.381]  God bless.
[02:04:30.782 --> 02:04:32.623]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:04:39.124 --> 02:04:40.685]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:04:40.805 --> 02:04:45.387]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:04:45.547 --> 02:04:48.308]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:04:48.508 --> 02:04:51.369]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:04:51.549 --> 02:04:56.271]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:04:56.491 --> 02:04:57.412]  If you simply prepare.
[02:04:57.633 --> 02:05:00.577]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:05:00.877 --> 02:05:07.767]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:05:07.867 --> 02:05:11.011]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
