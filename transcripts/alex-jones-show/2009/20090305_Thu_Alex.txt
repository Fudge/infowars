[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:01.711]  You know, Ron Paul grills Ben Bernanke.
[00:00:20.017 --> 00:00:25.301]  And Paul Sinodal Geithner, somewhat, but he's so gentlemanly he doesn't really nail them like some of us would like.
[00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:32.545]  There's an independent congressman, we're going to play this clip coming up at the start of the next hour, who absolutely savages him and says, where's the money?
[00:00:32.626 --> 00:00:34.207]  Why won't you say where the trillions went?
[00:00:34.527 --> 00:00:36.088]  And Bernanke will not say.
[00:00:36.528 --> 00:00:38.249]  That's some of those clips coming up in the next hour.
[00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:45.174]  Then we've got a doctor coming on, a medical doctor, about how vaccines over and over again end up causing the plagues they're supposedly meant to treat.
[00:00:45.194 --> 00:00:46.075]  This is on record.
[00:00:46.815 --> 00:00:51.537]  Because that dovetails with a story that Paul Watson wrote, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:57.380]  Accidentally contamination a vaccine with live avian flu virus, virtually impossible.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.384]  And it's all over the German, it's all over the Czech news, it's all over the Canadian news, Canadian Free Press, the Toronto Sun.
[00:01:06.144 --> 00:01:08.466]  Baxter product contained live flu virus.
[00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:20.038]  Had nothing to do with the regular flu vaccine with a spectrum of different viruses being prepared at different labs in Europe from the flu virus stock sent by the U.S.
[00:01:20.058 --> 00:01:20.318]  company.
[00:01:20.338 --> 00:01:21.519]  We've got it up on screen right now.
[00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:22.580]  We're live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.394]  And so, number one, it shouldn't have been mailed out to all these firms.
[00:01:30.654 --> 00:01:39.144]  Then they gave them instructions to mix it, without telling them what it was, with the other spectrum of regular flu viruses that are airborne and highly contagious, with the deadly.
[00:01:39.164 --> 00:01:40.045]  But it's hard to catch.
[00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:43.228]  But if you can catch it, it only lives a few seconds in the air.
[00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:45.411]  Regular flu can live like 30 minutes or longer.
[00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:58.482]  If it recombines with this, which is what it would normally do, either in the live batch being made, or once it got in the human body, it would just be a devastating plague.
[00:01:59.102 --> 00:02:06.724]  Now, what's so scary about this is that they then radiate all of these and send them out to sub-labs that are supposed to do tests.
[00:02:07.504 --> 00:02:09.965]  And a lab in Czechoslovakia, this went all over Europe,
[00:02:11.212 --> 00:02:21.916]  They give ferrets an injection of it, and if the ferret doesn't get sick, they know that the flu was prepared and isn't live, because they have a problem with it not being damaged enough by the radiation to still be live flu, just the regular flu.
[00:02:22.557 --> 00:02:30.240]  But instead of the ferrets not getting sick like they were supposed to, or getting sick if it was regular flu vaccine and it hadn't been radiated right, they died.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.121]  And so they tested what was in it and said, my God, this is...
[00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:38.553]  The H5N1, the deadly bird flu.
[00:02:38.573 --> 00:02:42.054]  Again, hard to catch, but if you catch it, it kills people more than 60% of the time.
[00:02:42.854 --> 00:02:44.355]  Just deadly, deadly, deadly.
[00:02:45.275 --> 00:03:04.164]  So, incredible accident after incredible accident after incredible accident, and a lot of scientists are quoted in the Czechoslovakian news, Czech Republic news, other papers, saying, you know, we think this could be a setup by the company to cause some outbreak, and then they are also developing separately an HN
[00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:09.703]  An H5N1 vaccine, and this could be a money-making scam.
[00:03:09.943 --> 00:03:15.348]  You know, it's not Alex Jones saying that, it's the news saying that.
[00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:25.698]  And Baxter's been involved, before we have links to that, with Bayer that shipped out the live HIV and hepatitis in the Factor VIII blood product millions.
[00:03:27.492 --> 00:03:43.681]  I mean, this is just off the charts insane and you know, when I was talking to Marcus Williams about getting him on the show, he's a patriot, carries my books and films at his Nubian bookstore, one of the most successful private, you know, single-standing black bookstores in the country, and I got to know him because he sent us some
[00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:47.926]  We're working on getting Professor Griff on the show as soon as his schedule allows.
[00:04:03.084 --> 00:04:07.227]  He also told my producer this, you know, a black voice criticizing him so they can't claim it's some race thing.
[00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:23.396]  But he said, really, I want you to talk about, and he recommended some guests I have on, about how through the vaccines and other systems, how they're poisoning us, how the UN's been caught adding hormones to tetanus shots in Africa and other places to sterilize women.
[00:04:23.416 --> 00:04:24.837]  That's on record mainstream news.
[00:04:25.277 --> 00:04:28.720]  Nobel laureates have come out and said they're putting HIV in different
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:38.263]  Hepatitis C vaccinations in Africa, they were caught doing that in New York, accidentally, you know, having it in the hepatitis shots for gay men, because they would have a lot of sexual partners.
[00:04:38.283 --> 00:04:41.404]  We have perfect vector to spread it in the late 70s, early 80s.
[00:04:42.004 --> 00:04:52.828]  And so here he is today, set up a week ago, right when this avian flu being mixed in with a regular vaccine, news is breaking, and they're trying to find out where it was shipped, what was done.
[00:04:52.848 --> 00:04:57.830]  A week ago, this internally broke, as companies were demanding to find out why this happened.
[00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.891]  The company was stonewalling.
[00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:01.912]  We're still trying to find out the tales right now.
[00:05:01.952 --> 00:05:03.772]  This is a very serious issue.
[00:05:03.792 --> 00:05:08.294]  We need to address this as serious, because we know what these globalists are all about in eugenics.
[00:05:08.354 --> 00:05:10.635]  So, Marcus Williams, good to have you on with us, sir.
[00:05:11.256 --> 00:05:12.296]  How you doing, Al?
[00:05:12.316 --> 00:05:12.876]  Good to be with you.
[00:05:13.357 --> 00:05:13.557]  Good.
[00:05:13.597 --> 00:05:15.758]  What do you think of this latest report?
[00:05:16.158 --> 00:05:26.202]  This is exactly what you brought up that you wanted to discuss a week ago on the show, was what you called meta-sin, as in a sin.
[00:05:26.422 --> 00:05:27.803]  Interesting timing to have you on today.
[00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:31.610]  Yeah, that's actually a book written by Dr. Scott Whittaker.
[00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.210]  Yes.
[00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.711]  So I hope that you have on your show real soon.
[00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:44.113]  And he's been speaking out of the things as far as the whole eugenics, vaccines, lots of that you cover on your show all the time.
[00:05:44.194 --> 00:05:52.596]  And I think it's going to be a real good interview to have on your show, hopefully real soon, to go more in detail with somebody who's a little bit more specialized into the whole
[00:05:53.191 --> 00:05:55.672]  vaccines, the whole medical field, versus myself.
[00:05:55.952 --> 00:06:01.195]  Yes, we're setting up, Dr. Scott Whitaker, we're also setting up, Professor Griff, thanks to you.
[00:06:01.255 --> 00:06:20.464]  Now, specifically though, I mean, you know, you have a bookstore, you've read these books, you've covered it, you've seen it, more and more it comes out, this has been done in Africa, some countries in Africa, 40% have HIV, they do medical tests, these women have never even had sex in many cases, even the BBC admits that somebody is basically giving them the HIV.
[00:06:21.556 --> 00:06:26.040]  Right, and even go back with the whole Tsitsigi syphilis experiment.
[00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:38.770]  I mean, it's been throughout long periods of time and years where we've seen the government and certain pharmaceutical companies doing experiments on the people through drugs, experimentation and stuff like that.
[00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.992]  It's been going on in Africa for a long period of time.
[00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:47.778]  So we've even seen Obama increase the funding for Planned Parenthood and other HIV
[00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:54.740]  Uh, treatment, uh, condoms and everything in Africa has been boosted up underneath his, uh, his administration.
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:01.464]  So, but the main reason why I wanted to come on your show was that, um, uh, you called because you saw my interview with a professor Griff.
[00:07:02.085 --> 00:07:11.631]  And I think that a lot of times the media, a lot of people are under the impression, like the vast majority of black people are just sold on Barack Obama, which is very far from the truth.
[00:07:12.712 --> 00:07:15.574]  There's a large number of people in the African American community.
[00:07:16.243 --> 00:07:19.484]  Who do not support Obama, even during the primaries.
[00:07:19.544 --> 00:07:22.105]  I mean, myself, I was a Ron Paul supporter.
[00:07:23.006 --> 00:07:29.348]  I was disappointed that he didn't go on the independent ticket or maybe go on the Constitution Party ticket.
[00:07:29.368 --> 00:07:33.210]  So since he didn't run, I voted for Stimpy McKinney.
[00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:34.451]  Yes.
[00:07:34.831 --> 00:07:42.534]  But I think that a lot of people, though, I think, just like when I heard you interview Paul Craig Roberts, I think when you said that he had voted, supported Obama,
[00:07:43.617 --> 00:07:52.903]  I just think that Obama's voting record and who financed his campaign was open to the public many, many months before the election.
[00:07:53.623 --> 00:08:00.287]  And I never, within the black community, let's say just outside of Illinois and Chicago, Barack Obama was a nobody.
[00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:07.271]  I never heard of Barack Obama until the 2004 Democratic Convention when he gave a speech and a lot of people know
[00:08:08.649 --> 00:08:12.492]  Talk about Obama giving this great speech, and then when I watched it, I really didn't see anything of substance.
[00:08:12.532 --> 00:08:16.074]  I saw a good act, but I didn't hear any substance.
[00:08:16.134 --> 00:08:27.021]  So, I checked the guy's voting record, and looked at who financed his campaign, and I'm thinking that this is not somebody I think that the people should be endorsing.
[00:08:27.962 --> 00:08:37.328]  And so, after digging into his record on the Patriot Act, funding the war, refusing to investigate Bush on any war crimes, FISA, NAFTA,
[00:08:37.782 --> 00:08:59.297]  We saw during the primaries, the Democratic primaries, uh, Barack Obama's economic advisor, one of them, uh, Alan Goosby, who's a member of Skull and Bones, said that, uh, I think it was the Canadian consulate that a lot of the rhetoric that Obama was saying about NAFTA during the Democratic Ohio primaries was just a bunch of talk and that he really didn't mean what he was saying.
[00:08:59.377 --> 00:09:06.302]  So, um, I just think that, you know, I think a lot of people that they really have to get over, get off of the whole,
[00:09:06.869 --> 00:09:07.590]  American Idol
[00:09:19.935 --> 00:09:23.197]  They don't really want to dig deep into the issues.
[00:09:23.277 --> 00:09:24.737]  They get on a bandwagon.
[00:09:24.797 --> 00:09:26.178]  Things were bad under Bush.
[00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:27.239]  The economy's imploding.
[00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:37.984]  We want to believe that this is really a good guy and he's going to fix things, but he's even gone on the show with Stephanopoulos, the Sunday show, and now said, yeah, that was campaign rhetoric on Naftali Gaddin.
[00:09:38.064 --> 00:09:40.826]  I mean, it's just an incredible betrayal.
[00:09:41.086 --> 00:09:49.430]  Do you think that the folks in Atlanta that you talk to, black or white, are they starting to break the spell, or are they still just as deep in that spell?
[00:09:50.293 --> 00:10:19.780]  I think a large portion of them are still deep in that spell, but I think over time it goes on that more and more of them are going to wake up and realize that Barack Obama was one of the biggest political frauds in recent memory, because with him adding more troops to Afghanistan, which was no secret, prior to him being elected, but we still saw a lot of people within the so-called anti-war movement, like Code Pink and others, you know, support Obama, but I think over time once they see that Obama really has no agenda to really fix the economy,
[00:10:20.775 --> 00:10:24.718]  Remove the troops from the war, really bring jobs into this country.
[00:10:25.098 --> 00:10:30.042]  I think a lot of the hype and stuff is going to... I think it's going to be fade away before the end of the year, easily.
[00:10:30.526 --> 00:10:39.492]  That's right, now he's going out to big black groups and others, but specifically going and speaking to big black conferences and saying, hey, you're going to lose your jobs, particularly black folks.
[00:10:39.512 --> 00:10:41.013]  This is going to be really tough now.
[00:10:41.394 --> 00:10:42.795]  That's basically the change.
[00:10:43.395 --> 00:10:44.456]  And they're saying, what?
[00:10:44.536 --> 00:10:47.978]  Because he promised us milk and honey and hope and change, everything was going to be all right.
[00:10:48.298 --> 00:10:55.984]  And then he just switched right into the fear of what Bush had done, saying, look, do what we say with the banks or a crisis will turn into a catastrophe.
[00:10:56.784 --> 00:11:03.247]  And he's now even cutting subsidies, and I'm not for socialism because it makes you dependent, but they're done making us dependent now.
[00:11:03.588 --> 00:11:07.570]  He's cutting a bunch of subsidies actually to the people, and it's all going to the banks.
[00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.311]  I mean, the bankers are just gorging everything.
[00:11:11.051 --> 00:11:11.992]  Right, you're absolutely right.
[00:11:12.032 --> 00:11:25.679]  With the bailout thing back in October, a large portion of the Congressional Black Caucus voted against the bailout during the first vote within the House of Representatives, and it was Barack Obama who got on the phone
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:32.746]  Well, and on top of it, it doesn't matter what color he is, whether he's from Africa, or from China, or from Russia,
[00:11:52.697 --> 00:11:59.381]  But it is really a lie to say that he's, you know, a black guy because his dad was mainly Arab and his mom was white.
[00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:01.823]  And so there's a lot of fraud, you know, there as well.
[00:12:01.843 --> 00:12:03.504]  It's just the guy is a complete phony.
[00:12:04.084 --> 00:12:05.585]  Stay with us, Mr. Williams.
[00:12:06.986 --> 00:12:13.370]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.411]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:12:16.385 --> 00:12:17.405]  But who is the enemy?
[00:12:17.926 --> 00:12:18.426]  Bin Laden.
[00:12:18.726 --> 00:12:19.726]  This is his M.O.
[00:12:19.746 --> 00:12:21.067]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:12:21.087 --> 00:12:22.767]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:12:23.087 --> 00:12:29.830]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.670]  Some U.S.
[00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:36.392]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:12:37.052 --> 00:12:40.555]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:12:40.575 --> 00:12:43.357]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:13:07.612 --> 00:13:11.775]  Hello, this is Peter Kronschnabel from Midas Resources, and I'd like to share some thoughts with you.
[00:13:12.075 --> 00:13:24.022]  In today's economy, with the government spending gone wild, the banking system on the verge of collapse, and Wall Street in continuous freefall, we both know that it is critical that you protect your savings and retirement programs now.
[00:13:24.423 --> 00:13:29.446]  Macroeconomics can be very confusing, but the solution to securing your personal assets is very simple.
[00:13:30.006 --> 00:13:31.467]  It's purchase of gold and silver.
[00:13:32.006 --> 00:13:38.033]  These precious metals have been the trusted means of exchange for centuries, and they've never been more important in our country's history.
[00:13:38.673 --> 00:13:42.458]  It's up to you to design your survival plan, one based on gold and silver.
[00:13:42.998 --> 00:13:43.719]  Give me a call.
[00:13:43.779 --> 00:13:47.203]  I'm Peter Kronschnabel at 800-686-2237, extension 108, and allow me to outline an easy answer to your questions.
[00:13:52.526 --> 00:13:53.967]  That's Peter Kranschnabel at 1-800-686-2237 ext.
[00:13:53.987 --> 00:13:53.967]  108.
[00:13:54.007 --> 00:13:54.727]  Call Peter at 1-800-686-2237 ext.
[00:13:54.747 --> 00:13:56.408]  108, where you can still purchase gold with paper.
[00:14:06.929 --> 00:14:10.230]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.830]  How would you like to be debt free in 90 days?
[00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:13.611]  Guaranteed!
[00:14:14.011 --> 00:14:20.652]  DebtCrisisSolutions.com has helped tens of thousands out of debt since 1993 and will free you from the debt trap.
[00:14:20.932 --> 00:14:28.634]  DebtCrisisSolutions.com legally guarantees to put an end to wage garnishment, bank levies and liens and you won't pay one dime to creditors.
[00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:29.335]  I think so.
[00:14:52.857 --> 00:14:53.438]  We're good to go.
[00:15:07.094 --> 00:15:08.956]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:15:09.076 --> 00:15:14.261]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:15:14.441 --> 00:15:15.762]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:15:16.043 --> 00:15:24.230]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:30.176]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:15:30.336 --> 00:15:32.118]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:15:32.178 --> 00:15:34.340]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:38.725]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:41.027]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:15:41.128 --> 00:15:48.996]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:15:49.076 --> 00:15:49.476]  We're good.
[00:16:16.016 --> 00:16:23.141]  You know, this Obama deception, this betrayal, is very sad to me because I want good relations between all human beings.
[00:16:24.422 --> 00:16:30.946]  I'm sick and tired of the elite playing people off against each other through tribalism, which is the modern term, racism.
[00:16:32.967 --> 00:16:34.749]  Divide and conquer, balkanization.
[00:16:35.649 --> 00:16:41.353]  But they plan, once people learn that Obama's betrayed people, they're already doing it.
[00:16:41.393 --> 00:16:43.494]  When people criticize Obama, they say it's racism.
[00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:49.394]  To actually drive a wedge through all of this, and now he is the face of imperialism.
[00:16:49.674 --> 00:16:59.421]  I like what Professor Griff said, and we put this in the Obama Deception, thanks to Marcus Williams, that he is the new black face of imperialism.
[00:16:59.441 --> 00:17:03.444]  We have that on the back cover, that tyranny gets a facelift.
[00:17:03.464 --> 00:17:07.287]  It's just a front, so that the people of the world feel like they're included in the new world order.
[00:17:07.307 --> 00:17:08.908]  That's what Webster Tarpley says in the film.
[00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:12.171]  Charis One says something similar.
[00:17:13.302 --> 00:17:16.464]  They said it here on the air, that they put a black face on the New World Order.
[00:17:17.104 --> 00:17:18.545]  Everybody was ready for revolution.
[00:17:18.805 --> 00:17:25.468]  They were standing up, they were angry, they were waking up to the globalists, and all of a sudden they put a black man up there, and now everybody's sitting back.
[00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:29.090]  Now everybody's going, okay, I'll stand down.
[00:17:29.951 --> 00:17:32.632]  Can you comment on those thoughts, Mr. Williams?
[00:17:33.773 --> 00:17:41.377]  Yeah, I think that in reference to... I mean, it's really been puzzling to me as far as
[00:17:42.233 --> 00:17:48.458]  Like, back in 2000, Barack Obama ran for Congress and lost to Bobby Rush by, I think, over, like, 25 to 30 points.
[00:17:49.459 --> 00:18:01.069]  And then to see this guy, within an eight-year period, raise just under a billion dollars in campaign finances, and then win the presidency, I mean, it's a movie script.
[00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:08.856]  I mean, it's just as funny as Nelson Mandela being locked up in jail for 27 years, and as soon as he gets out, he becomes president.
[00:18:09.608 --> 00:18:25.579]  I mean, it's the script behind the scenes that's going on, and I think that too many people, especially those within the African-American community, which I think are being brainwashed by a lot of, especially black media, who wouldn't even give Cynthia McKinney absolutely no play in the media.
[00:18:25.659 --> 00:18:37.448]  When you look at Cynthia McKinney's resume as far as calling for investigations on 9-11, investigating Bush impeachment, speaking out against NAFTA and other things, the war on drugs,
[00:18:38.163 --> 00:18:42.884]  She spoke out against the white slavery kidnapping going on by DynCorp and Halliburton.
[00:18:42.924 --> 00:18:48.125]  She spoke out on the trillions stolen by the Pentagon and they went after her because she is good.
[00:18:48.806 --> 00:19:07.610]  Right, and just to see how the media, I'm just talking about black media, black talk radio, commercial black talk radio like Steve Harvey, Michael Bayes and others give her absolutely no media play but they give Barack Obama basically free commercials, free play 24-7 brainwashing the people into
[00:19:08.328 --> 00:19:15.932]  Binding to somebody who has really absolutely no record, no history of really doing anything major within politics and within the black community.
[00:19:15.972 --> 00:19:26.417]  I mean, I always ask people all the time, those who support Obama during the election, name me one hot-button topic or issue where Barack Obama was on the right side.
[00:19:26.477 --> 00:19:33.381]  And a lot of people that look at me and they can't name that one issue where Barack Obama was standing on the right side of a hot-button issue.
[00:19:33.401 --> 00:19:35.762]  But we start with the bailout, FISA, the Patriot Act.
[00:19:38.233 --> 00:19:43.597]  Now he's backing Bush and continuing to not give detainees even Geneva Convention rights.
[00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:48.302]  He's keeping the secret camps open, talking about closing Guantanamo.
[00:19:48.462 --> 00:19:52.425]  And I go down the street and talk to Obama supporters, most people in Austin,
[00:19:53.186 --> 00:19:56.867]  And they even know who I am and know about the New World War, and they go, yeah, but we just got to get behind him.
[00:19:56.907 --> 00:19:58.448]  Come on, Alex, we got to give him a chance.
[00:19:58.748 --> 00:19:59.929]  He's not going to be perfect.
[00:20:00.389 --> 00:20:02.449]  And I'm like, look, it's a setup.
[00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.050]  He's a puppet just like Bush.
[00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.010]  Quit looking at the puppet.
[00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.291]  Look at the elites behind him.
[00:20:07.091 --> 00:20:08.252]  Things are only going to get worse.
[00:20:08.672 --> 00:20:10.472]  Why do you enjoy being suckers?
[00:20:10.933 --> 00:20:13.133]  Why do you love being suckers?
[00:20:13.494 --> 00:20:14.894]  Why do you love being conned?
[00:20:15.174 --> 00:20:16.975]  Why do you love being taken for a ride?
[00:20:18.262 --> 00:20:28.368]  I think the exact same thing where you see, I guess, within the white community as far as those people who know better but still, for whatever reason, choose to go with the Southerner, the two lesser, no, the lesser of two evils.
[00:20:28.888 --> 00:20:40.195]  Same thing within the black community, whereas a lot of people who know about the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, everything, but yet they still would not support Symphony McKinney, but they would support Obama.
[00:20:40.215 --> 00:20:45.078]  I just heard, um, I think even in the primaries I heard, what's the guy's name, Mike Rivera from WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:20:46.434 --> 00:20:47.014]  I don't think so.
[00:21:06.536 --> 00:21:06.996]  That's right.
[00:21:07.216 --> 00:21:08.477]  That's the best chance of winning.
[00:21:08.497 --> 00:21:10.537]  That's a real big problem across the board.
[00:21:10.877 --> 00:21:12.378]  People like to feel like they're the winner.
[00:21:12.778 --> 00:21:17.019]  And so as soon as it looks like a team's going to win the Super Bowl and the playoffs, they become fans.
[00:21:17.339 --> 00:21:19.259]  It's the bandwagon effect I talked about earlier.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.000]  And it's like a horse race.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.060]  That's the horse that's supposed to win.
[00:21:23.441 --> 00:21:24.521]  They want to bet on that horse.
[00:21:24.601 --> 00:21:26.001]  But who owns the track?
[00:21:26.521 --> 00:21:27.702]  Who owns the company?
[00:21:27.982 --> 00:21:29.362]  Who owns the whole racetrack?
[00:21:29.962 --> 00:21:30.162]  Right.
[00:21:30.723 --> 00:21:31.703]  Instead of just the horses.
[00:21:32.563 --> 00:21:36.024]  Yeah, my whole thing is that, you know, I can't compromise my values.
[00:21:41.503 --> 00:21:44.744]  I mean, I just can't compromise my values like that.
[00:21:45.204 --> 00:21:46.904]  Marcus Williams, stay there with us for the rest of the hour.
[00:21:46.924 --> 00:21:52.886]  I want to come back and take calls, get into a host of issues, and I want to plug your great bookstore for folks in the Georgia area and there in Atlanta.
[00:21:53.427 --> 00:21:53.887]  Stay with us.
[00:21:57.148 --> 00:21:58.048]  We're on the march.
[00:21:58.548 --> 00:22:00.149]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:22:01.089 --> 00:22:03.770]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:07.077 --> 00:22:12.761]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:22:13.021 --> 00:22:17.804]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:22:17.824 --> 00:22:23.027]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[00:22:23.247 --> 00:22:26.669]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:35.336]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[00:22:35.677 --> 00:22:41.061]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[00:22:41.482 --> 00:22:47.227]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:22:47.467 --> 00:22:49.789]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[00:22:50.349 --> 00:22:55.252]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[00:22:55.292 --> 00:22:56.373]  And we knew what to do.
[00:22:56.413 --> 00:22:57.994]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:22:58.014 --> 00:23:00.615]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film.
[00:23:19.022 --> 00:23:22.608]  That finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:23:23.249 --> 00:23:31.763]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:38.935]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:23:39.236 --> 00:23:42.298]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:23:42.398 --> 00:23:47.622]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:23:48.182 --> 00:23:50.825]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:23:51.265 --> 00:23:57.830]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[00:24:00.947 --> 00:24:02.188]  That was the government-sponsored terror.
[00:24:02.588 --> 00:24:05.211]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:24:06.692 --> 00:24:16.780]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:24:17.261 --> 00:24:18.321]  Garden in a can.
[00:24:18.682 --> 00:24:22.245]  Garden in a can is your source for premium, long-term, storable seeds.
[00:24:22.825 --> 00:24:24.587]  Garden in a can is ready when you are.
[00:24:24.847 --> 00:24:27.129]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.

[00:24:37.277 --> 00:24:38.278]  Garden in a can.
[00:24:38.698 --> 00:24:39.559]  It's that simple.
[00:24:39.899 --> 00:24:40.199]  Fresh.
[00:24:40.599 --> 00:24:40.980]  Healthy.
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:41.760]  Easy.
[00:24:42.301 --> 00:24:46.244]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.

[00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:41.711]  We are going to go back to Mr. Williams here in a moment and take your phone calls.
[00:25:41.931 --> 00:25:44.412]  Then in the next hour I've got some banking clips.
[00:25:44.953 --> 00:25:47.094]  Finally Bernanke gets grilled like he should be.
[00:25:48.806 --> 00:25:50.847]  We'll be going over that.
[00:25:51.227 --> 00:26:03.230]  Before we go back to Marcus Williams, the Nubian Bookstore in Atlanta, Georgia, getting his perspective on Obama, the New World Order, the eugenics operations, and a lot more, I wanted to tell the listeners about some of the sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:05.970]  Like a Cola Blue, and we've got one right here in the office.
[00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:09.471]  Speaking of the devil, my throat is parched.
[00:26:09.491 --> 00:26:10.952]  I forgot to get a glass of water during the break.
[00:26:10.992 --> 00:26:12.372]  They caught me out there with questions.
[00:26:12.952 --> 00:26:14.793]  Somebody give me a Cola Blue, delicious drink.
[00:26:15.213 --> 00:26:15.553]  Thank you.
[00:26:16.273 --> 00:26:17.674]  Atmospheric water generator for the home.
[00:26:17.714 --> 00:26:19.915]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[00:26:19.975 --> 00:26:21.276]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride.
[00:26:21.596 --> 00:26:23.517]  Goes through seven filters inside.
[00:26:23.537 --> 00:26:26.298]  7.5 gallons a day in the average humidity.
[00:26:26.338 --> 00:26:27.739]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[00:26:28.099 --> 00:26:28.959]  Neutral pH.
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:31.941]  E-C-O-L-O blue dot com.
[00:26:32.321 --> 00:26:33.581]  Acola blue dot com.
[00:26:33.621 --> 00:26:35.582]  Banners up on Infowars dot com.
[00:26:35.622 --> 00:26:37.343]  Prisonplanet dot com if you forget the address.
[00:26:37.763 --> 00:26:37.883]  Or 800-691-6043.
[00:26:37.903 --> 00:26:37.944]  800-691-6043.
[00:26:43.426 --> 00:26:46.890]  Another one of our fine sponsors I want to tell you about is My Solar Backup.
[00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:51.956]  It's all about getting off the grid, being self-sufficient so the slave masters can't control us.
[00:26:51.996 --> 00:26:53.918]  That's what it's all about is institutionalizing us.
[00:26:54.739 --> 00:27:02.368]  It's an emergency power backup kit which consists of the PowerSource 1800 power plant and high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[00:27:03.129 --> 00:27:08.573]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[00:27:08.893 --> 00:27:11.796]  The solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[00:27:12.216 --> 00:27:14.137]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[00:27:14.238 --> 00:27:15.559]  MySolarBackup.com.
[00:27:15.799 --> 00:27:17.800]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:27:18.101 --> 00:27:18.781]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:27:18.801 --> 00:27:18.841]  877-327-0365.
[00:27:18.861 --> 00:27:20.222]  The great folks from Solutions Science.
[00:27:20.242 --> 00:27:20.703]  MySolarBackup.com.
[00:27:29.409 --> 00:27:44.570]  Alright, speaking of another plug, because I want him to plug it, he carries our books and videos, and I've talked to a lot of folks that have been there, an incredible selection for folks in the Georgia area or in the Atlanta metro area, and you've also got a
[00:27:45.311 --> 00:28:04.267]  Way folks can call and I guess get a brochure, because you've got a bunch of titles, especially that are particularly informative for African-Americans, but I think everybody should read these and see these films and understand that perspective of the true awakening happening in society, particularly with the black community out there.
[00:28:04.288 --> 00:28:06.970]  So Mr. Williams, put a plug in for your fine bookstore.
[00:28:07.976 --> 00:28:09.857]  Uh, my name is Marcus Williams.
[00:28:09.877 --> 00:28:17.320]  I'm the owner of Nubian Bookstores, located in Southlake Mall in Laurel, Georgia, which is right outside of Atlanta on the south side.
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:21.402]  I can reach you at 678-422-6120.
[00:28:21.822 --> 00:28:29.585]  And besides just having my primary line of books are African American, but I also have a large conspiracy section.
[00:28:29.805 --> 00:28:31.106]  I probably have one of the largest
[00:28:31.986 --> 00:28:37.808]  Um, conspiracy new orders sections as far as books and inside of any major shopping mall within the state of Georgia.
[00:28:38.648 --> 00:28:51.131]  So if you might not be interested in receiving books by any African Americans, I also carry like a lot of, uh, Ralph Epperson, uh, Fritz Springmeier, Eustace Mullins, uh, uh, kind of Ralph Epperson.
[00:28:51.171 --> 00:28:58.233]  I have a bar section of those books and if there's anything that I don't have that you want, I can order any book, black, white,
[00:28:58.926 --> 00:29:04.009]  Asian, Chinese, whatever you want, I can order and get it to you and mail it out to you immediately.
[00:29:04.029 --> 00:29:12.254]  And I think, Alex, that your Obama deception film, I'm most definitely going to place a large bulk order to get your film in my store next week.
[00:29:12.354 --> 00:29:13.334]  Are you kidding, my friend?
[00:29:13.354 --> 00:29:15.075]  I'm going to give you a couple hundred free.
[00:29:15.095 --> 00:29:16.156]  You just tell the guys that.
[00:29:16.816 --> 00:29:18.477]  Okay, so the first 200 are free.
[00:29:18.678 --> 00:29:18.998]  Boom.
[00:29:19.398 --> 00:29:23.700]  For what you did with the Professor Griffin interview, we're very, very thankful to you on that.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.122]  Give the number out slowly for folks that might want to write it down.
[00:29:26.832 --> 00:29:28.812]  Okay, I'm a Nubian bookstore.
[00:29:29.012 --> 00:29:30.453]  I'm in Morro, Georgia.
[00:29:30.473 --> 00:29:34.353]  My phone number is 678-422-6120.
[00:29:35.134 --> 00:29:42.695]  And if there's any book on any subject matter, it doesn't matter, black, white, Asian, Mexican, or whatever, I can get it.
[00:29:43.095 --> 00:29:48.676]  I get a large request for like a lot of conspiracy books and stuff, too, to a lot of guys in prison.
[00:29:48.716 --> 00:29:54.417]  So if you even have like a family member who's locked up, I know a lot of prisons only allow books to be delivered to prisons
[00:29:54.909 --> 00:30:20.935]  to a bookstore to the publishing company so if you need me to mail out books to anybody that you might have incarcerated also I can take care of that for you I can reach you at 678-422-6120 and Alex I really appreciate you for even giving me this opportunity to come on your show to even discuss this issue and promote my story because when you called me I was shocked because I've been listening to you like over seven years I've been listening to you and I
[00:30:21.664 --> 00:30:23.085]  I've been playing your program in my source.
[00:30:23.125 --> 00:30:27.907]  I get a lot of people who's always listening who's always asking from time to time as far as, you know, who is that?
[00:30:27.947 --> 00:30:28.968]  And I tell them that it's you.
[00:30:29.028 --> 00:30:30.749]  And a lot of people in the room recognize your voice.
[00:30:31.489 --> 00:30:34.791]  And also, you know, identify, you know, as far as being a listener to your show too.
[00:30:34.811 --> 00:30:42.455]  So you have a large listening audience within the African American community who's also hip to a lot of the stuff going on with Obama.
[00:30:42.495 --> 00:30:47.258]  So I wanted a lot of your listeners who are, who might be non-black to know that.
[00:30:47.881 --> 00:30:54.127]  Don't be fooled by what you see in the media and stuff as far as thinking that everybody in the African American community is sold on Obama.
[00:30:54.147 --> 00:30:59.952]  There's a large, huge number of people who don't, but you just don't get to see them on TV.
[00:30:59.972 --> 00:31:04.476]  Let's say like a Republican or something like that, above the net, so there's a large...
[00:31:05.188 --> 00:31:06.910]  Number of people who are hip to the game.
[00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:12.174]  Well here's an example of stereotypes and judging a book by its cover normally being a fraud.
[00:31:12.274 --> 00:31:15.537]  Ron Paul goes before CPAC, the big neocon conservative.
[00:31:16.277 --> 00:31:21.182]  Thousands and thousands, look like tens of thousands in this giant auditorium as far as the eye can see.
[00:31:21.822 --> 00:31:24.565]  Sitting in chairs and Limbaugh was speaking and all these other people.
[00:31:25.265 --> 00:31:30.708]  Ron Paul gets up and says, we killed over a million Iraqis, the war was evil, the war was a fraud, the war was bad.
[00:31:31.709 --> 00:31:40.915]  We need to stop it, and the majority are clapping and whooping because the average conservative doesn't believe what they say a conservative is in the media.
[00:31:40.935 --> 00:31:44.617]  They love telling people who they are, telling people what they are.
[00:31:44.637 --> 00:31:48.299]  We need to just stop thinking that way and decide who we are for ourselves.
[00:31:48.659 --> 00:31:52.322]  But so many people stay, like David Icke says and others, in that little bubble.
[00:31:53.345 --> 00:32:08.034]  When we're spiritual beings, and we're on this planet for a reason, one time, and we're all together as humanity, and there's always been good and evil in the world, and as soon as we don't realize that there's evil, we fall prey to it.
[00:32:08.074 --> 00:32:09.395]  I want to go to some phone calls now.
[00:32:09.955 --> 00:32:11.296]  He called in earlier, but I couldn't go to him.
[00:32:11.316 --> 00:32:14.638]  Then he wants to give us a review of the Watchmen film.
[00:32:15.299 --> 00:32:16.960]  He got a chance to see it at a sneak peek.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.701]  It comes out tomorrow.
[00:32:19.302 --> 00:32:21.043]  Tito in Canada.
[00:32:21.383 --> 00:32:22.965]  You're on the air, Tito.
[00:32:23.325 --> 00:32:24.586]  Finish up the point you wanted to add.
[00:32:25.365 --> 00:32:25.906]  Okay, great.
[00:32:26.266 --> 00:32:31.291]  I mean, just to make one thing clear, you know, I don't really feel comfortable giving a full review of the movie.
[00:32:31.331 --> 00:32:34.855]  It doesn't come out until tomorrow, you know, so I'd really like to preserve... Okay, whatever.
[00:32:34.915 --> 00:32:37.257]  You said you wanted to talk about the movie, so I'm giving you a chance to.
[00:32:37.277 --> 00:32:37.617]  Whatever.
[00:32:37.958 --> 00:32:38.778]  No, I appreciate it.
[00:32:38.919 --> 00:32:49.149]  I just wanted to let everyone know that it's a great talking point for those people who may not be familiar with the false flag attack, and it brings up a lot of... This movie touches on basically
[00:32:49.835 --> 00:33:11.013]  So many things that we talk about here on the show and so many things in the truth movement, you know, whether it's the one conspiracy figure who, who is trying to get the truth out and, and, uh, you know, fighting against the new world order, even, even right till the end to never compromise, even in the face of Armageddon, you know, and that's a message that we can all take to heart as well.
[00:33:11.353 --> 00:33:18.319]  It's a fantastic movie and I just, I just, just want everyone to see it so that when they have their friends and they want to talk about these kinds of things,
[00:33:18.772 --> 00:33:19.873]  This is another springboard.
[00:33:19.893 --> 00:33:29.121]  It's another opportunity, and it's another place for us to bring up these points about how these things happen, not only in the superhero world they're showing, but in our world as well.
[00:33:29.301 --> 00:33:31.022]  Yeah, but you say it's a fantastic movie.
[00:33:31.102 --> 00:33:35.086]  Weren't you saying that they stage a false flag attack to bring world peace?
[00:33:35.106 --> 00:33:37.388]  I mean, that's how the Illuminati operates and thinks.
[00:33:37.448 --> 00:33:44.654]  Are you saying it's fantastic, because it's a great way to get people to wake up, because they only operate in popular culture, to understand what false flag terror is?
[00:33:45.578 --> 00:33:46.138]  That's true.
[00:33:46.238 --> 00:33:58.645]  And secondly, the movie doesn't necessarily say that this is the right decision or a good decision, and allows the viewer to become engaged and sort of question what they're seeing, you know, and the motives behind it.
[00:33:58.965 --> 00:34:02.407]  It surely doesn't paint it in a good picture.
[00:34:02.427 --> 00:34:06.749]  Okay, let me ask you this question, and then I want to ask Mr. Williams this question.
[00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:09.551]  Marcus Williams, our guest, new bookstore owner outside Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:34:11.016 --> 00:34:17.100]  Children of Men, and scores of other films the last couple years come out, V for Vendetta.
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:22.103]  The government's putting the deadly bioweapon, the vaccines, to bring in martial law.
[00:34:22.463 --> 00:34:24.385]  The government sterilized the people.
[00:34:24.865 --> 00:34:29.908]  The government staging bombing attacks to bring in control in the film Children of Men.
[00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:43.616]  All these, and I've gotten a chance to actually know some high-level Hollywood people, and I've seen the tribulations they've gone through trying to get the truth out, because there's a group above Hollywood controlling them and threatening them, even threatening their families and doing smear campaigns.
[00:34:43.636 --> 00:34:59.265]  So I do know that all of Hollywood isn't controlled, but when I talk to them, they tell me who is controlled, and they admit the Pentagon and CIA, I've had the X-Files folks on, Dean Hagelin saying the CIA planted the story of flying a hijacked jet in the World Trade Center, the government uses a drill to make NORAD stand down,
[00:35:00.486 --> 00:35:00.986]  No, we're good.
[00:35:12.028 --> 00:35:13.669]  This is a rebellion in Hollywood?
[00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:18.333]  Or is this revelation of the method where they're subconsciously conditioning us?
[00:35:20.134 --> 00:35:23.216]  Why do you think so many of these movies are coming out now?
[00:35:23.236 --> 00:35:31.883]  I mean, almost every science fiction or action movie, you know, the last Die Hard movie, an evil guy in the government staging a thing to cause a fire cell to blow up the economy.
[00:35:32.103 --> 00:35:33.144]  What do you think's happening, Tito?
[00:35:33.988 --> 00:35:43.853]  Well, I think, first of all, for Watchmen, I mean, it was written in 1985, so it takes that sort of political, still a little bit with the Cold War mentality behind it.
[00:35:44.433 --> 00:35:48.755]  And so, you know, we're looking at it after that.
[00:35:48.815 --> 00:35:51.377]  But notice how we're entering back into that now, though.
[00:35:51.897 --> 00:35:53.258]  We're going back into the Cold War.
[00:35:53.278 --> 00:35:54.278]  It is very sophisticated.
[00:35:54.298 --> 00:35:56.059]  Go ahead.
[00:35:56.379 --> 00:36:01.942]  And I just feel like the movie is set in a different time, and it uses superheroes in place of government.
[00:36:02.355 --> 00:36:13.300]  Because in this movie, essentially, the superheroes act on behalf of governments, you know, sometimes, and even bigger than the government when they take in their full power over the world.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:26.566]  And so, while it doesn't come out and necessarily say, hey, governments can do this or that, it puts the idea in your head that these people who may be benign appearing and wanting to help the world, sometimes in their cold logic,
[00:36:27.202 --> 00:36:29.443]  You know, make very horrific decisions.
[00:36:29.763 --> 00:36:31.024]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[00:36:31.404 --> 00:36:31.965]  Thanks for the call.
[00:36:32.045 --> 00:36:33.365]  I'll do a review coming up Monday.
[00:36:33.405 --> 00:36:34.946]  I'm going to see it Saturday with some of the guys.
[00:36:35.466 --> 00:36:36.947]  It's somebody's birthday here, so we're going out.
[00:36:37.668 --> 00:36:43.811]  A rarity, we're kind of celebrating the Obama Deception is done, take a few nights off and actually go out and eat and stuff.
[00:36:44.491 --> 00:36:54.577]  We do that, but that's what the higher level, Illuminist, Masons, Rosicrucians do, is when you see, people love these archetypal superheroes, those are
[00:36:55.768 --> 00:37:02.191]  Taking the place of the angels, the gods they worship at Skull and Bones and other things.
[00:37:02.591 --> 00:37:04.672]  And so that's that message they're giving.
[00:37:04.692 --> 00:37:05.973]  Give us your take on this, Marcus.
[00:37:06.854 --> 00:37:19.040]  I think that most definitely a lot of those movies are coming out with the government doing, I guess, evil things against the public.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:23.282]  When you guys were talking, I was thinking back to the whole Oklahoma City bombing where
[00:37:24.511 --> 00:37:27.953]  It was the governor's brother, so it was the governor or the mayor who wrote a book.
[00:37:28.274 --> 00:37:30.115]  Yeah, the governor's brother wrote a book.
[00:37:30.435 --> 00:37:30.655]  Right.
[00:37:30.995 --> 00:37:35.458]  Where a Tim McVeigh bombs the federal building, exactly as it happened.
[00:37:35.478 --> 00:37:35.779]  Go ahead.
[00:37:36.219 --> 00:37:42.563]  And as a fact, I think the guy who did it had the exact same or so much spelled last name as Tim McVeigh in the book.
[00:37:43.244 --> 00:37:52.550]  And I think most people think a lot of it is just a lot of conditioning the people subconsciously through these movies to, I don't know, just to accept
[00:37:55.828 --> 00:37:58.670]  I really, it's really my bad.
[00:37:58.750 --> 00:37:59.250]  I agree with you.
[00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:11.195]  And that's why they'll allow directors, because I've looked into this, that are actually on our side, the big boys will say go ahead and let them do it, and the directors themselves don't realize they're being manipulated.
[00:38:11.796 --> 00:38:14.477]  But take Oliver Stone as any given Sunday.
[00:38:15.477 --> 00:38:17.398]  It's the Aztecs versus the Knights Templars.
[00:38:17.578 --> 00:38:19.139]  Everything is Illuminati in that film.
[00:38:19.459 --> 00:38:22.300]  That's Oliver Stone letting you know that he knows what's really going on.
[00:38:23.703 --> 00:38:28.345]  But we still, you know, a lot of times within the movies, we still have the symbolism and storylines and stuff.
[00:38:28.425 --> 00:38:34.267]  It's just another, it's just a mirror of what's going to happen in the future or what's going on right now in reality.
[00:38:34.748 --> 00:38:35.868]  Take New Orleans.
[00:38:36.428 --> 00:38:40.790]  Oil Storm aired nine months before Katrina hit.
[00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:47.273]  Mayor Ray Nagin took part in the film where exactly what happens, happens, and then it comes out nine months later.
[00:38:48.013 --> 00:38:48.233]  Right.
[00:38:48.593 --> 00:38:52.635]  And it was also reported that Mayor Nagin also had told
[00:38:53.832 --> 00:38:54.272]  I don't
[00:39:13.039 --> 00:39:14.660]  It's really crazy Alex.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.240]  It's just mind boggling.
[00:39:16.481 --> 00:39:18.481]  These Luciferians are magicians.
[00:39:18.521 --> 00:39:19.462]  They believe in magic.
[00:39:19.542 --> 00:39:21.343]  They believe in numbers.
[00:39:21.643 --> 00:39:29.486]  I've bought the official black magic books that have been republished for 500 years and read them.
[00:39:29.706 --> 00:39:30.887]  They call it lesser magic.
[00:39:30.947 --> 00:39:35.809]  They believe that by showing you what they're going to do first, that gives them even more power later.
[00:39:37.149 --> 00:39:39.189]  The Native Americans called it counting coup.
[00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:59.973]  They would have a little soft club, and in a fight, if they were really a big warrior, you know, especially in fights within the village, you know, to test, you know, if somebody wanted to challenge them, they would do death blows repeatedly, and then after they'd counted coup five or six times, see, I could have already killed you six times, then they'd pull out the real club with the big rock and kill them.
[00:40:00.894 --> 00:40:02.014]  So this is counting coup.
[00:40:03.888 --> 00:40:28.488]  So, Alex, I got a quick question for you that I wanted to ask you as far as, you know, what would you, uh, with everything that's going down with the economy, uh, with, uh, Obama sitting more truth to Afghanistan, what do you think would be, like, the best, uh, action, I guess, that people would, I mean, what, what can the people do as far as trying to counterattack what's going on with the economy and everything?
[00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:33.272]  Specifically, uh, I mean, is that two questions, or?
[00:40:34.281 --> 00:40:39.362]  Uh, just specifically as far as, you know, what do you think that the people should do as this?
[00:40:39.563 --> 00:40:45.764]  I mean, like through my bookstore, like I always know, give away, you know, information and stuff to try to wake up people.
[00:40:45.784 --> 00:40:51.066]  So, you know, certain things that's going on within politics, uh, health and et cetera.
[00:40:51.786 --> 00:40:58.688]  But as far as I think that as far as trying to come up with some type of a group or network, I really didn't really have a real,
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.221]  Positive effect of real change.
[00:41:01.562 --> 00:41:03.383]  Yeah, well I think just resist.
[00:41:03.943 --> 00:41:06.985]  Demonstrate, call into talk shows, make films, make blogs.
[00:41:07.426 --> 00:41:10.208]  Point out there's a shadow government, it's what the Obama deception does.
[00:41:10.628 --> 00:41:12.269]  Point out that, hey, forget Obama.
[00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:14.811]  You know, forget Bush.
[00:41:15.752 --> 00:41:18.293]  There are the puppet masters behind the puppets.
[00:41:19.714 --> 00:41:24.018]  Things are only going to get worse until we arrest these bankers, until we arrest the New World Order.
[00:41:25.237 --> 00:41:46.236]  And talk about that as a solution, instead of getting caught up, I know you know this, but for the general folks out there, want a solution, to not get caught up in the false choices they give us, and debate just that limited universe of ideas they give us, and expand out of the larger universe of ideas, and really get more aggressive and say, you're a pack of made-off criminals,
[00:41:47.037 --> 00:42:08.075]  Like Bernard Madoff that are looting and robbing, you are criminal, you are destroying things by design and just basic educate people one person at a time to how illegitimate this is until the system just loses all credibility and then we can take it back and educate the police and military not to go along with martial law.
[00:42:08.715 --> 00:42:24.505]  and defend the second amendment and expose that uh... you know stand up to democrats and say look at you you you know you attack bush for doing all this evil but now you're for it because it's obama and you feel like he's your man you gotta seat at the table you're a sucker i think being aggressive and in people's faces
[00:42:25.505 --> 00:42:26.286]  Uh, is the way to go.
[00:42:26.306 --> 00:42:30.891]  So many people are nice about it and kind of, you know, creep up, and I know you think I'm a kook, but there's a new world order.
[00:42:31.551 --> 00:42:32.833]  All the time for that's over.
[00:42:32.893 --> 00:42:34.514]  We need people to be bold.
[00:42:34.895 --> 00:42:36.436]  You know, fortune favors the bold.
[00:42:36.877 --> 00:42:38.118]  What did Frederick Douglass say?
[00:42:38.518 --> 00:42:41.481]  Freedom is not given, it is taken, it is seized.
[00:42:43.316 --> 00:42:53.401]  We just have to get aggressive, and know we're right, and know we have power, and know we can affect change, and develop our communities, and love each other, like Mahatma Gandhi said, and fight against these corrupt people.
[00:42:53.421 --> 00:42:54.622]  Does that answer your question, Marcus?
[00:42:55.082 --> 00:42:56.663]  I think you hit the nail right on the head.
[00:42:56.723 --> 00:42:59.244]  You gave the answer I was looking for.
[00:42:59.264 --> 00:43:00.065]  Alright, stay there, sir.
[00:43:00.225 --> 00:43:01.506]  We'll all get answers from each other.
[00:43:01.966 --> 00:43:04.287]  We'll be right back with more calls from Marcus Williams.
[00:43:04.347 --> 00:43:05.268]  Stay with us.
[00:43:06.761 --> 00:43:11.042]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:43:11.282 --> 00:43:16.184]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.

[00:44:06.504 --> 00:44:12.893]  Today unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:44:13.253 --> 00:44:14.956]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:15.891 --> 00:44:16.912]  But who is the enemy?
[00:44:17.433 --> 00:44:17.953]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:18.233 --> 00:44:19.214]  This is his M.O.
[00:44:19.234 --> 00:44:20.556]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:20.596 --> 00:44:22.297]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:22.598 --> 00:44:29.344]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:29.745 --> 00:44:30.185]  Some U.S.
[00:44:30.225 --> 00:44:35.871]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:36.571 --> 00:44:40.014]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:40.034 --> 00:44:42.056]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:45:08.194 --> 00:45:10.176]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[00:45:10.776 --> 00:45:13.259]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[00:45:13.839 --> 00:45:18.003]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[00:45:18.777 --> 00:45:20.538]  You know that you need to prepare.
[00:45:20.878 --> 00:45:23.901]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[00:45:24.281 --> 00:45:27.283]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[00:45:27.583 --> 00:45:38.971]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds and survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.

[00:45:46.656 --> 00:45:48.477]  I was just talking to Paul Hartman.
[00:46:16.673 --> 00:46:24.555]  During the break, Mr. Williams and his barber is a Prince Hall black mason.
[00:46:25.195 --> 00:46:30.396]  They were having a big discussion about the New World Order and he was saying that his barber knew all about the New World Order and said they were puppets and it was bad.
[00:46:30.836 --> 00:46:32.596]  But then he thinks that being a mason's good.
[00:46:32.616 --> 00:46:36.777]  They wanted me to ask you, do you ever have a black mason's Prince Hall Lodge?
[00:46:37.077 --> 00:46:40.338]  It was before the masons were racist and wouldn't let black folks in.
[00:46:40.358 --> 00:46:41.218]  They had their own group.
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.541]  I mean, do you have any comments on that?
[00:46:45.641 --> 00:46:48.762]  Like, reportedly Jesse Jackson and others are really Masons.
[00:46:48.802 --> 00:46:53.144]  You never heard Jesse Jackson say, take down the statue behind the Supreme Court.
[00:46:53.444 --> 00:46:55.325]  We've been there, we videotaped it in D.C.
[00:46:56.046 --> 00:46:59.588]  of Albert Pike, the founder of the Ku Klux Klan, Supreme Grand Mason.
[00:47:00.868 --> 00:47:12.554]  Yeah, you know, here in Atlanta, Georgia, I'm originally from Michigan, but here in the South, the Masonic Order of the Eastern Star Movement is real, real big here in Georgia, in the South.
[00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:16.638]  I get a lot of Masons that come to my store.
[00:47:16.698 --> 00:47:25.099]  I do sell Masonic books and rituals because I have a large demand for people who want books dealing with Freemasonry.
[00:47:25.539 --> 00:47:32.260]  It's real big here and I get a lot of people who also know Reed who are familiar with your books and videos.
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:36.901]  I think that a lot of, in my personal opinion, I have a lot of relatives who are Masons.
[00:47:37.001 --> 00:47:37.481]  I'm not.
[00:47:38.301 --> 00:47:40.902]  In the Masonic Order, I've really never been impressed.
[00:47:42.406 --> 00:47:48.189]  With any of my family members as far as like any knowledge or anything like that, I guess they're learning in the lodges or whatever, so.
[00:47:50.550 --> 00:48:02.056]  I think, to me, I think it's, I think in the black community, to me personally, especially on the lower level, I think that it's, I don't really take the Masons as far as really being a real big
[00:48:04.165 --> 00:48:04.865]  I agree with you.
[00:48:04.965 --> 00:48:08.327]  I believe most masons, I know most masons, are porch masons.
[00:48:08.367 --> 00:48:09.107]  Let's take a call.
[00:48:09.467 --> 00:48:13.749]  Rob in California, you're on the air with the owner of the Nubian Bookstore in Atlanta, Georgia, Marcus Williams.
[00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:17.211]  Yeah, you guys were right on it with the movie industry.
[00:48:17.231 --> 00:48:19.852]  I just saw The International last weekend.
[00:48:19.892 --> 00:48:21.733]  That movie sent chills down my spine.
[00:48:22.794 --> 00:48:23.454]  Have you seen that one?
[00:48:24.105 --> 00:48:26.847]  No, but I've read the synopsis and talked to folks that have seen it.
[00:48:27.088 --> 00:48:33.293]  They claim there's one bad rogue bank that needs to be banned, and the big international banks need to stop it in the end.
[00:48:33.333 --> 00:48:36.976]  And notice they're introducing legislation to shut down the smaller banks internationally right now.
[00:48:37.276 --> 00:48:41.800]  So these movies come in perfectly, just like Blood Diamond says, stop the diamonds.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:44.142]  That only means stop the diamonds that independents are putting out.
[00:48:44.502 --> 00:48:46.424]  It's actually De Beers that has the slave camps.
[00:48:46.704 --> 00:48:48.346]  But they imply that De Beers is fighting it.
[00:48:49.312 --> 00:48:53.995]  Yeah, he made a comment in there, he said, it's not about the money, he said, we want the debt.
[00:48:55.616 --> 00:48:58.057]  And that just, like, that summed it all up for me, you know.
[00:48:58.317 --> 00:49:02.079]  But I wanted to ask you, have you seen the series of films, The Arrivals?
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:03.620]  No.
[00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:08.663]  No, that's what, like, all the kids around here, that's what they're getting into.
[00:49:08.703 --> 00:49:13.546]  That's like, kind of like their new, their new zeitgeist or whatever, however you want to put it.
[00:49:14.085 --> 00:49:16.707]  It's a series of, like, 15 minute films.
[00:49:16.727 --> 00:49:17.968]  There's about 50 of them.
[00:49:18.188 --> 00:49:19.489]  I think I've seen one or two now, yeah.
[00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:29.778]  Yeah, I mean, I've got... I watched about three of them, but I'm just kind of up in the air about what it's... I didn't know if it was, like, just... It seemed to be kind of anti-Semitic.
[00:49:31.739 --> 00:49:37.444]  But I was just wondering if you had seen them and what your take was on those things before I get in and watch the rest of the 50 of them.
[00:49:37.704 --> 00:49:38.645]  I think I've seen one or two.
[00:49:38.705 --> 00:49:40.146]  It's like a YouTube release, right?
[00:49:40.993 --> 00:49:41.853]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:41.873 --> 00:49:45.254]  You gotta go click from one to the next to the next to the next and stuff.
[00:49:45.994 --> 00:49:53.456]  Well, you know, my whole issue is people that obsess on one group or another, that just plays into the balkanization.
[00:49:53.636 --> 00:49:55.256]  Can't we just all be against the New World Order?
[00:49:55.496 --> 00:49:58.017]  Can't we all be against tyranny and people being oppressed?
[00:49:58.837 --> 00:50:00.337]  And then we can come together against that.
[00:50:00.857 --> 00:50:04.298]  They love us fighting over race or religion or issues.
[00:50:04.338 --> 00:50:06.658]  That's how they break us down and control us.
[00:50:06.679 --> 00:50:08.639]  Do you have any comments on that, Marcus?
[00:50:09.958 --> 00:50:18.486]  I think that with the whole thing as far as what you was saying, I want to kind of bring this back up before I forget about what you had to say before the last Rick as far as being more aggressive.
[00:50:19.386 --> 00:50:27.473]  And I think that I really wish, that I wish that, that little clip I guess you're about to play with Senator Sanders, of grilling the Bernanke.
[00:50:28.114 --> 00:50:32.858]  I really wish Ron Paul had that same fire to be a little bit more aggressive.
[00:50:32.878 --> 00:50:34.840]  I was looking for that during the primaries.
[00:50:35.569 --> 00:50:38.832]  And I think that if Ron Paul had that same pie, it would be aggressive.
[00:50:38.933 --> 00:50:39.493]  I agree with you.
[00:50:39.553 --> 00:50:40.114]  Stay there.
[00:50:40.234 --> 00:50:41.215]  Stay there, Mr. Williams.
[00:50:41.235 --> 00:50:42.817]  We're going to come back in five more minutes.
[00:50:42.857 --> 00:50:45.139]  I'm going to play Senator Sanders' clip.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:52.466]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:50:58.413 --> 00:51:03.017]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:51:03.157 --> 00:51:05.919]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:51:06.119 --> 00:51:09.001]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:09.161 --> 00:51:13.885]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:14.105 --> 00:51:15.026]  If you simply prepare.
[00:51:15.226 --> 00:51:18.170]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.

[00:51:59.429 --> 00:52:01.331]  Waging War on Corruption.
[00:52:01.811 --> 00:52:04.774]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:08.357 --> 00:52:21.629]  Coming up, I'm going to go over some financial banking news, get into a real drilling,
[00:52:22.731 --> 00:52:27.696]  And I don't want to go after Ron Paul, but I'm hearing from a lot of people, folks, big buzz out there.
[00:52:28.237 --> 00:52:32.942]  They want him to get really aggressive when he's on the House Banking Committee with Bernanke and others.
[00:52:32.962 --> 00:52:38.548]  He brings up how it's hurting things, how the debt bubble isn't going to work, but why, how about, hey, the Federal Reserve's private.
[00:52:39.068 --> 00:52:40.569]  You know, you guys engineered this thing.
[00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:44.693]  He'll say things like that here on the air, but he's just so gentlemanly on the news and everywhere else.
[00:52:44.713 --> 00:52:46.314]  He's got this platform now.
[00:52:46.754 --> 00:52:48.356]  They're putting him on the news more and more.
[00:52:48.816 --> 00:52:50.938]  I think because they know he's not being that aggressive.
[00:52:51.078 --> 00:52:52.759]  And I think he thinks like a Zen master.
[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:57.583]  It's a Catch-22 where he can get on more and just show people the alternative.
[00:52:59.685 --> 00:53:01.987]  And by being more palatable that he gets more attention.
[00:53:02.007 --> 00:53:12.454]  But I think you've got to break through the mesmerized spell that people are under with some cold water in the face or a slap against the face.
[00:53:12.934 --> 00:53:16.837]  But Ron Paul's done so much good and it's overall good.
[00:53:17.818 --> 00:53:21.561]  And you know it's easy to look at somebody in the arena and say they should do it this way or that way.
[00:53:22.021 --> 00:53:24.423]  I just think we should look at people like Senator Sanders and others.
[00:53:25.003 --> 00:53:35.226]  Yeah, I think my whole thing as far as wanting to see Ron Paul be more aggressive, I look at it more as being just like a form of constructive criticism.
[00:53:35.246 --> 00:53:40.547]  Because Ron Paul, you know, he had the network on the internet, he had the money, the movement.
[00:53:52.031 --> 00:54:01.576]  But I think that, I think that if he was just a little bit more aggressive as far as attacking people like Obama and Hillary.
[00:54:01.596 --> 00:54:02.176]  That's right!
[00:54:02.977 --> 00:54:03.977]  That's right.
[00:54:04.398 --> 00:54:10.341]  He could have baited them into responding to him, and then he could have showed the world that, you know, he is the man.
[00:54:10.361 --> 00:54:15.343]  Because on foreign policy and on economics, Ron Paul is, you know, he's the man.
[00:54:15.363 --> 00:54:20.546]  I mean, even within the black community, during the polling, Ron Paul, as far as most blacks,
[00:54:23.856 --> 00:54:31.339]  Let me just throw in here, people need to tell Ron Paul, hey we want to hear you get behind the state's rights movement.
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:38.162]  We want to hear you tell your supporters to get behind that, so that we can try to reconvene the federal government and arrest these criminals.
[00:54:39.463 --> 00:54:44.967]  I mean, he is out there speaking out, and he does go before the Republicans and say you killed a million people, so that was very bold.
[00:54:45.067 --> 00:54:46.488]  That took a lot of courage, but I agree.
[00:54:46.548 --> 00:54:47.889]  It's constructive criticism.
[00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:50.951]  We need to have more of that because he is so prominent.
[00:54:51.271 --> 00:54:52.232]  We built this guy.
[00:54:52.272 --> 00:54:55.894]  He needs to, you know, dance with those that rung him, and he is doing that.
[00:54:57.255 --> 00:54:59.657]  It's just that I totally agree with you, Marcus.
[00:55:00.217 --> 00:55:05.301]  Yeah, and I think I even talked to you on your show shortly after the New Hampshire primaries,
[00:55:06.536 --> 00:55:09.459]  Ron Paul, I guess, wasn't receiving votes, so I think it was in the time of Sutton.
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:21.871]  And I was hoping for Ron Paul to, you know, hop on and make the issue as far as the whole voting fraud thing and, like, hold a big, major press conference, maybe like in Sutton, but do that voting from where the votes were being counted.
[00:55:21.891 --> 00:55:28.617]  And I think that by him just ignoring it and just moving on, I think it would be a waste of time as far as not challenging the vote fraud that was happening in New Hampshire.
[00:55:29.498 --> 00:55:31.780]  I just think that was just another sign of that passivity.
[00:55:32.355 --> 00:55:44.503]  But Ron Paul, besides him, Cinthia McKinney in percentage, I mean, I think that he's, overall, I think he's by far, he's the best politician out there.
[00:55:45.163 --> 00:55:59.673]  And I just hope that in the future, that maybe if he doesn't run in 2012, that he becomes, you know, be more aggressive and get out there and hopefully take a running mate who has just as much star power as him and hopefully try to make a difference in the future.
[00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:06.414]  I really appreciate you asking and giving me an opportunity just to come on your show just to discuss a few issues with you.
[00:56:07.155 --> 00:56:20.484]  And I know it's kind of getting close to winding down so I just wanted to thank you once again for just giving me a chance to promote my story and to have an opportunity just to talk politics with you because I never thought in a million years that you would call me and ask me to do this.
[00:56:20.504 --> 00:56:29.491]  So that kind of just shows me a little bit, well actually a lot, that you're also a person who reaches out to the regular everyday working person.
[00:56:33.647 --> 00:56:34.288]  Absolutely!
[00:56:34.328 --> 00:56:36.529]  Well, the Nubian Bookstore there outside Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:56:36.569 --> 00:56:41.693]  Marcus Williams, thank you so much for all you do and thank you for your help with the Obama deception.
[00:56:41.733 --> 00:56:42.874]  God bless you and Godspeed.
[00:56:44.588 --> 00:56:44.848]  You bet.
[00:56:44.888 --> 00:56:45.429]  Take care, sir.
[00:56:45.749 --> 00:56:46.830]  We'll talk to you again in the future.
[00:56:47.411 --> 00:56:47.751]  All right.
[00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:48.832]  An amazing individual.
[00:56:48.872 --> 00:56:49.532]  Very informative.
[00:56:49.552 --> 00:56:52.815]  Another one of those great people out there fighting tyranny, defending liberty.
[00:56:52.835 --> 00:56:58.681]  We're going to come back and into Senator Sanders' true resistance to Bernanke.
[00:56:58.721 --> 00:57:02.204]  What we need to see more of from Ron Paul and a lot more straight ahead.
[00:57:02.264 --> 00:57:06.828]  Then we're going to get into the vaccines, shipping bird flute out and putting it in the flu shot.
[00:57:07.728 --> 00:57:11.550]  You don't have to be in the military to enjoy military surplus savings.

[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:17.320]  But who is the enemy?
[00:58:17.841 --> 00:58:18.341]  Bin Laden.
[00:58:18.641 --> 00:58:19.441]  This is his M.O.
[00:58:19.481 --> 00:58:20.962]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:58:20.982 --> 00:58:22.702]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:58:23.002 --> 00:58:29.765]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:58:30.145 --> 00:58:30.585]  Some U.S.
[00:58:30.625 --> 00:58:36.267]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:58:36.987 --> 00:58:40.468]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:58:40.488 --> 00:58:43.470]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:08.041]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[00:59:08.221 --> 00:59:10.483]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[00:59:10.623 --> 00:59:14.626]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[00:59:14.786 --> 00:59:16.647]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout...
[00:59:22.112 --> 00:59:30.735]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[00:59:30.955 --> 00:59:37.077]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoodsDirect.
[00:59:37.318 --> 00:59:40.719]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[00:59:40.919 --> 00:59:45.061]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoodsDirect.
[00:59:53.302 --> 00:59:53.663]  I think so.
[01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:15.576]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:16.296 --> 01:00:17.116]  You want answers?
[01:00:17.896 --> 01:00:18.797]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:19.437 --> 01:00:23.078]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:27.700]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.155 --> 01:00:41.016]  Alright, there's a bunch of these clips on the internet.
[01:00:41.056 --> 01:00:42.217]  These hearings went for hours.
[01:00:42.237 --> 01:00:44.738]  We're going to play several of them, then go to your phone calls.
[01:00:44.778 --> 01:00:54.883]  We have a guest coming on dealing with the bird flu that they tried to mix up with the regular flu vaccine so it could mutate and just cause incredible devastation.
[01:00:54.903 --> 01:00:56.604]  That's mainstream news that it could have done that.
[01:00:57.204 --> 01:00:57.905]  That's coming up.
[01:00:58.965 --> 01:01:05.109]  This is Senator Bernie Sanders questioning Ben Bernanke and he starts asking him, where is the money?
[01:01:05.229 --> 01:01:06.029]  Where did you spend it?
[01:01:06.049 --> 01:01:07.430]  And Bernanke tries to spend it and says,
[01:01:08.527 --> 01:01:09.247]  It's on our website.
[01:01:09.267 --> 01:01:11.228]  He goes, what banks did you give it to?
[01:01:11.609 --> 01:01:13.029]  Well, I can't tell you that.
[01:01:14.590 --> 01:01:25.395]  And Bloomberg Financial is reporting on this, yet again, and it's not 2.5 trillion, it's not 3 trillion like the Senator is saying, it's over 9.7 trillion right now.
[01:01:25.455 --> 01:01:26.536]  So let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[01:01:27.716 --> 01:01:34.620]  Will you tell the American people to whom you lent 2.2 trillion of their dollars
[01:01:35.472 --> 01:01:38.535]  Will you tell us who got that money and what the terms are of those agreements?
[01:01:39.616 --> 01:01:41.197]  We explain each of our programs.
[01:01:41.298 --> 01:01:43.660]  In terms of the terms, we explain the terms exactly.
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.002]  We explain what the collateral requirements are.
[01:01:46.022 --> 01:01:47.063]  To whom did you explain that?
[01:01:47.764 --> 01:01:48.645]  It's on our website.
[01:01:49.746 --> 01:01:52.348]  So all that information is available in our commercial paper program.
[01:01:52.368 --> 01:01:53.089]  And who got the money?
[01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:55.151]  Hundreds and hundreds of banks.
[01:01:55.291 --> 01:01:58.474]  Any bank that has access to the U.S.
[01:01:58.834 --> 01:01:59.775]  Federal Reserve's discount.
[01:01:59.795 --> 01:02:00.516]  Tell us who they are.
[01:02:01.707 --> 01:02:08.073]  No, because the reason that is counterproductive and will destroy the value of the program is that banks will not come to the show.
[01:02:08.093 --> 01:02:09.114]  Well, isn't that too bad?
[01:02:09.975 --> 01:02:10.115]  Sorry?
[01:02:10.135 --> 01:02:11.476]  In other words, isn't that too bad?
[01:02:11.496 --> 01:02:15.079]  They took the money, but they don't want to be public about the fact that they received it.
[01:02:15.119 --> 01:02:16.080]  We heard a whole lot about AIG.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.241]  They're on the front pages.
[01:02:17.261 --> 01:02:21.545]  These are very... Now, I got banks and I have businesses in the state of Vermont who are in a lot of trouble.
[01:02:21.665 --> 01:02:22.045]  Not banks.
[01:02:22.085 --> 01:02:23.347]  Our banks, by the way, are doing pretty well.
[01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:26.389]  Now, how do these guys who are honest business people get it?
[01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:27.751]  Do you have to be a large
[01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:32.092]  Greedy, reckless financial institution to apply for these monies?
[01:02:32.172 --> 01:02:33.213]  There is no subsidy.
[01:02:33.393 --> 01:02:34.873]  There is no capital involved.
[01:02:34.893 --> 01:02:36.114]  There is no gift involved.
[01:02:36.234 --> 01:02:43.236]  It is a collateralized short-term liquid loan that is both over collateralized and is recourse to the company itself.
[01:02:43.276 --> 01:02:44.677]  We have never lost a penny doing it.
[01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:51.977]  And how can other institutions get those loans as well?
[01:02:52.818 --> 01:02:55.941]  According to the law, we are supposed to be lending to depository institutions.
[01:02:56.722 --> 01:02:58.364]  Let me just say this, Mr. Chairman.
[01:02:58.484 --> 01:02:59.766]  I have a hard time
[01:03:00.908 --> 01:03:29.175]  understanding that you have put 2.2 trillion dollars at risk uh... without uh... making those names available those institutions public and we're going to introduce legislation today by the way to demand that you do that it is unacceptable to me that that goes on uh... mister chairman uh... one of the untold one of the issues that bothers me very much
[01:03:30.356 --> 01:03:35.840]  Is that for many, many years some of us were concerned about deregulation.
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:40.623]  Some of us were very concerned about where the economy was going.
[01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:48.369]  We didn't hear much coming from the Bush administration who told us over and over again that the fundamentals of the economy were sound.
[01:03:48.389 --> 01:03:50.010]  We didn't hear much from the Fed.
[01:03:51.584 --> 01:04:06.431]  Now, looking back, do you think that maybe there was a problem there that you did not raise some alarms out there and said, we got a problem when trillions of dollars are being floated around the world in a deregulated, non-transparent way?
[01:04:07.331 --> 01:04:13.054]  When you heard people talking about the fundamentals of the economy being sound, how come you didn't raise an alarm?
[01:04:16.465 --> 01:04:24.727]  Well, there was a massive credit crisis and it's been true that our regulatory system and our financial supervisory system did not succeed in preventing those impacts.
[01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:28.389]  And I think it's very important that we... Did not succeed in preventing them.
[01:04:28.849 --> 01:04:29.769]  Let's take it another way.
[01:04:29.809 --> 01:04:33.050]  Do you think that the repeal of Glass-Steagall was a tragic mistake?
[01:04:34.188 --> 01:04:45.975]  No, I don't think so, but I do think we need to have much more effective holding company and oversight supervision and I strongly support a strong program of regulatory reform going forward.
[01:04:46.195 --> 01:05:00.082]  Mr. Chairman, in my state people ask me how it could be that you're providing loans at almost zero interest rates to large financial institutions who are then charging consumers 25 or 30 percent interest rates on their credit cards.
[01:05:01.403 --> 01:05:10.625]  Do you think that that's acceptable or do you think that those institutions that are receiving help from the Fed should substantially cut those interest rates?
[01:05:11.718 --> 01:05:15.721]  Well, with respect to credit cards, we've been working actively in that area in a couple of dimensions.
[01:05:15.821 --> 01:05:21.224]  One is that credit availability will be enhanced by our TALC program, which I've just announced.
[01:05:21.244 --> 01:05:22.485]  But you're not answering my question.
[01:05:23.206 --> 01:05:30.210]  Should a financial institution that is being bailed out by taxpayers charge those taxpayers 25 or 30 percent interest rates when they're receiving?
[01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:33.673]  Well, you need to address that to the Treasury, because it's the TARP that's providing
[01:05:34.233 --> 01:05:36.914]  Help to failing or damaged firms.
[01:05:36.954 --> 01:05:40.215]  The Federal Reserve lends to healthy firms on a collateralized basis.
[01:05:41.555 --> 01:05:42.216]  Last question.
[01:05:43.876 --> 01:05:52.359]  Many again of my constituents, I think people all over this country, are wondering why the CEOs of these large financial institutions who have been extremely greedy
[01:05:53.397 --> 01:06:00.480]  Reckless and maybe have engaged in illegal behavior have not been fired so that we can work with people who want to really reform the system.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:07.903]  Should the CEOs of the financial institutions that have led us into this deep, deep recession be fired?
[01:06:09.083 --> 01:06:14.385]  Well, pay and job tenure should depend on performance and those who perform poorly should lose their jobs.
[01:06:14.425 --> 01:06:16.966]  Are any of them who have been... Many have lost their jobs.
[01:06:18.187 --> 01:06:20.948]  Most of them are the major guys who are still holding their positions.
[01:06:23.063 --> 01:06:26.486]  Senator Alexander, absolutely amazing.
[01:06:26.526 --> 01:06:30.229]  Let's just go through that five minute clip and the lies that were there.
[01:06:30.809 --> 01:06:32.791]  Number one, the good news, before I get to the lies though.
[01:06:34.352 --> 01:06:37.975]  This guy has an aura of invincibility, this aura of being God.
[01:06:38.015 --> 01:06:51.206]  You watch the body language and the verbal language when somebody like a President or a Prime Minister goes to speak before Congress, they shake their hand, act friendly, kiss their butt a little bit.
[01:06:51.867 --> 01:06:57.171]  When a private Federal Reserve Chairman shows up, before they would quiver, they would shake, they would grovel.
[01:06:57.211 --> 01:07:01.335]  Reporters do that because they know this is really who owns and runs the country, these private banks that run these scams.
[01:07:02.577 --> 01:07:03.498]  And Masquerade is federal.
[01:07:04.058 --> 01:07:29.319]  And when you have people like Senator Sanders and just a few others treating them with the disrespect they treat us with, treating him like a common criminal that he is, and you heard Sanders saying someone needs to go to jail, that guy and Alan Greenspan, chief among them, Henry Paulson, all of them, Geithner, Summers, Volcker, they engineered what's happening now on record.
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:37.303]  And so, Ron Paul and others need to start getting aggressive, not even disrespectful, but they need to be disrespected.
[01:07:37.323 --> 01:07:39.044]  We need to pull them down off their pedestals.
[01:07:39.064 --> 01:07:41.145]  We need to show people the common crooks they are.
[01:07:41.645 --> 01:07:44.546]  That's how this is going to happen, is people identify who the enemy is.
[01:07:44.586 --> 01:07:45.487]  Just identify the enemy.
[01:07:45.827 --> 01:07:48.088]  You do that, everything's going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:07:48.328 --> 01:07:49.569]  People are going to bring them to justice.
[01:07:51.325 --> 01:07:55.769]  You've just got to identify the criminals and the source of the infection.
[01:07:56.049 --> 01:07:56.990]  This is the cancer.
[01:07:57.731 --> 01:07:59.793]  Bernanke and the rest of them, they're the New World Order.
[01:07:59.813 --> 01:08:05.518]  They're the ones using all of this to get new regulations against their competitors while they've fallen under the regulations.
[01:08:06.439 --> 01:08:08.100]  That's their new regulations they're talking about.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:12.945]  It's a global government over where your money goes or some middle class person trying to leave the country.
[01:08:13.936 --> 01:08:18.259]  See, they take the crises they create and always get more power in this global new bank that's going to run the world.
[01:08:18.919 --> 01:08:19.699]  Let's go through his lies.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:23.402]  First off, we've got to stand up to him and identify him as the scumbag crooks they are.
[01:08:23.942 --> 01:08:26.323]  That guy should be arrested immediately, not up there.
[01:08:26.343 --> 01:08:27.024]  But he didn't like it.
[01:08:27.044 --> 01:08:27.764]  He's not used to that.
[01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:30.546]  He's going to get more and more used to that, punks.
[01:08:30.666 --> 01:08:32.967]  We are identifying you for the den of vipers you are.
[01:08:33.528 --> 01:08:34.688]  There's no future if we don't.
[01:08:36.569 --> 01:08:38.430]  You heard him say, keep the Glass-Steagall Act.
[01:08:39.391 --> 01:08:42.453]  Keep the repeal of it that allowed all of these derivatives to happen.
[01:08:43.712 --> 01:08:44.873]  They're not changing any of it.
[01:08:45.294 --> 01:08:49.179]  The CEOs, the CEO caps, all the major banks are exempt from that.
[01:08:49.439 --> 01:08:50.080]  Another hoax.
[01:08:51.121 --> 01:08:53.164]  He lies and says that's all up on our website.
[01:08:53.384 --> 01:08:54.906]  And the Senator Sanders says, no it's not!
[01:08:55.206 --> 01:08:56.208]  Who'd you give the money to?
[01:08:56.608 --> 01:08:58.310]  It just says on the website, we won't tell you!
[01:08:59.071 --> 01:09:00.172]  He goes, who'd you give it to?
[01:09:00.212 --> 01:09:01.273]  Oh, it's all on our website.
[01:09:01.493 --> 01:09:02.033]  No, it's not.
[01:09:02.113 --> 01:09:03.795]  And then he has to admit, okay, it's not there.
[01:09:04.495 --> 01:09:07.898]  A criminal liar counting on you being stupid!
[01:09:08.118 --> 01:09:13.502]  You have been, not stupid, but diverted by football and acting cool and, you know, all this other crap, folks.
[01:09:13.563 --> 01:09:18.086]  If you don't worry about the banks, as the Founding Fathers and history shows, you get enslaved real fast.
[01:09:21.149 --> 01:09:21.369]  Okay?
[01:09:21.389 --> 01:09:25.232]  Because with a stroke of a pen, they'll create enough money to buy the world back with, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[01:09:26.092 --> 01:09:27.473]  And as the head of the Bank of England in the 20s said.
[01:09:30.665 --> 01:09:34.827]  Then the biggest lie, he says there's no cost in these trillions of dollars we've given to private banks.
[01:09:36.008 --> 01:09:40.950]  Really, your taxes are going up, all these new regulations, we're going to pay carbon taxes to pay for all this.
[01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:46.572]  They're telling you it's over $20,000 per American, and that's in five months of the banker takeover.
[01:09:47.193 --> 01:09:52.135]  Nine plus trillion since then, plus the debt service on it, there's interest on it.
[01:09:54.016 --> 01:09:56.317]  But he says, oh no, you're not paying a penny, it's just free!
[01:09:58.336 --> 01:10:01.939]  Well, the banks have no intention of paying any of that back, and the government will just grow, grow, grow if they did.
[01:10:04.862 --> 01:10:07.905]  Then he lies and says there's nothing about credit cards.
[01:10:07.965 --> 01:10:10.467]  Everybody I know that's got credit cards, who even pay them?
[01:10:10.727 --> 01:10:12.509]  They might have a 3, 4 percent, got good credit.
[01:10:13.129 --> 01:10:14.511]  Suddenly they're telling you it's 10 percent.
[01:10:14.531 --> 01:10:17.033]  If you have bad credit, they're going, it's no longer 18, it's 29.
[01:10:17.113 --> 01:10:19.475]  This is loan sharking.
[01:10:20.236 --> 01:10:21.037]  Mafia level.
[01:10:22.765 --> 01:10:23.386]  So, they do.
[01:10:23.406 --> 01:10:28.476]  They give the banks these trillions, and then they go out and loan it to people at giant interest.
[01:10:28.797 --> 01:10:31.041]  See, the interest rate cuts aren't for us, it's for the elites.
[01:10:32.677 --> 01:10:34.618]  And then he talks about how they're getting tough on CEOs.
[01:10:34.658 --> 01:10:39.322]  These guys, a few of them have retired, in one case with billion-dollar golden parachutes.
[01:10:39.502 --> 01:10:42.104]  Others, you know, their deputies just roll into the place behind them.
[01:10:42.124 --> 01:10:43.005]  They're still on the board.
[01:10:43.685 --> 01:10:45.567]  So they're raping everybody financially there.
[01:10:46.127 --> 01:10:47.968]  And this is the culprit, Ben Bernanke.
[01:10:48.188 --> 01:10:49.730]  But that's how he needs to be talked to.
[01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:53.592]  When he starts lying, Sanders cut him off and said, hey, that's not what's going on!
[01:10:53.933 --> 01:11:00.858]  And Bernanke had to back off and basically admit he was a liar there because he was faced with someone that wasn't completely ignorant.
[01:11:01.258 --> 01:11:05.805]  I bet Sanders doesn't know about the Dallas Cowboys, but Senator Sanders knows how the banks work.
[01:11:06.847 --> 01:11:11.954]  I bet Senator Sanders doesn't know the coolest new t-shirt to wear, but he knows about the banks.
[01:11:13.328 --> 01:11:15.349]  And successful people know how the world works.
[01:11:15.749 --> 01:11:20.271]  Even if you don't care about your fellow man, you better care how stuff works.
[01:11:20.311 --> 01:11:23.813]  You better want to know how things operate, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:24.534 --> 01:11:26.775]  The world isn't all patty-cake, nice, friendly.
[01:11:26.815 --> 01:11:27.755]  It's very dangerous.
[01:11:27.875 --> 01:11:32.017]  There's a lot of hardcore parasites in the elite ranks at the low-level ranks.
[01:11:32.417 --> 01:11:37.040]  There's people out here in daily business that'll rip you off in ten seconds, that'll scam you in one second.
[01:11:38.083 --> 01:11:41.825]  There's a million people out here that'll knock you over the head or shoot you full of holes for $100.
[01:11:42.926 --> 01:11:45.588]  There's people out here that'll get you and kill you just for fun.
[01:11:45.748 --> 01:11:47.629]  There's people out there that'll screw you to the wall.
[01:11:47.889 --> 01:11:49.050]  Stop being denied.
[01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:50.891]  You know, stop living in denial.
[01:11:50.931 --> 01:11:54.053]  Stop being a little mindless, gullible sheep out there.
[01:11:54.633 --> 01:11:56.374]  And start acting like Sanders did.
[01:11:56.894 --> 01:12:01.017]  Just let these crooks know you don't respect them, they're filth, and they're going to be brought to justice.
[01:12:01.797 --> 01:12:03.578]  We need jail time for these people.
[01:12:03.859 --> 01:12:05.900]  Prison is the only place they need to go.
[01:12:07.355 --> 01:12:11.638]  Hello, this is Peter Kronschnabel from Midas Resources, and I'd like to share some thoughts with you.
[01:12:11.958 --> 01:12:23.845]  In today's economy, with the government spending gone wild, the banking system on the verge of collapse, and Wall Street in continuous freefall, we both know that it is critical that you protect your savings and retirement programs now.
[01:12:24.286 --> 01:12:29.309]  Macroeconomics can be very confusing, but the solution to securing your personal assets is very simple.
[01:12:29.889 --> 01:12:31.330]  It's purchase of gold and silver.
[01:12:31.869 --> 01:12:37.895]  These precious metals have been the trusted means of exchange for centuries, and they've never been more important in our country's history.
[01:12:38.535 --> 01:12:42.319]  It's up to you to design your survival plan, one based on gold and silver.
[01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:43.580]  Give me a call.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:47.063]  I'm Peter Kronschnabel at 800-686-2237, extension 108, and allow me to outline an easy answer to your questions.
[01:12:52.386 --> 01:12:54.007]  That's Peter Kranschnabel at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:12:54.047 --> 01:12:58.411]  Call Peter at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108, where you can still purchase gold with paper.
[01:13:07.439 --> 01:13:14.989]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:13:15.009 --> 01:13:16.611]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:13:16.711 --> 01:13:19.535]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:13:19.575 --> 01:13:24.541]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, the UNICEF?
[01:13:32.865 --> 01:13:37.793]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:13:39.015 --> 01:13:40.116]  An inside job.
[01:13:41.537 --> 01:13:42.578]  How dare you?
[01:13:43.959 --> 01:13:49.022]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:13:49.042 --> 01:13:51.663]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:13:51.743 --> 01:13:58.127]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:15:06.491 --> 01:15:11.074]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[01:15:11.414 --> 01:15:18.619]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[01:15:18.859 --> 01:15:20.260]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:24.362]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[01:15:24.623 --> 01:15:28.205]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[01:15:28.465 --> 01:15:32.548]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[01:15:32.928 --> 01:15:34.869]  Phase One is a One World Currency.
[01:15:35.049 --> 01:15:35.869]  We're good to go.
[01:16:12.512 --> 01:16:17.897]  Dr. Rebecca Carley is a degreed medical doctor, a surgeon.
[01:16:18.477 --> 01:16:20.419]  Her only child was damaged by vaccine.
[01:16:20.439 --> 01:16:21.460]  She began to investigate it.
[01:16:22.361 --> 01:16:23.922]  And we just got her on the line.
[01:16:23.962 --> 01:16:25.604]  She was pointing out something I wasn't even aware of.
[01:16:26.424 --> 01:16:32.450]  The London Telegraph reporting on a bunch of people dying in Poland from a bird flu vaccine test.
[01:16:33.090 --> 01:16:34.231]  You guys did pull that up, right?
[01:16:34.311 --> 01:16:35.132]  You said you did pull it up.
[01:16:35.372 --> 01:16:37.154]  Pull it up on screen for folks so they can see it.
[01:16:38.490 --> 01:16:44.531]  There's a lot to cover in the time we have left, and I also want to go to calls for folks that are holding on this subject.
[01:16:45.071 --> 01:16:50.953]  But Dr. Karlo, I'd love to have you back up next week for two hours, if you can do it, to really detail all this and go through your knowledge.
[01:16:50.993 --> 01:16:55.814]  Now, on one side, bird flu itself can kill people, but it's very hard to catch.
[01:16:55.854 --> 01:17:00.495]  The point is, they're mixing it with vaccines and then not even irradiating it.
[01:17:00.575 --> 01:17:01.575]  That's no accident.
[01:17:02.515 --> 01:17:03.795]  Just absolutely amazing.
[01:17:03.835 --> 01:17:05.396]  And regular flu vaccine
[01:17:08.328 --> 01:17:14.691]  Inoculations, and thank God, some subcontractors tested it, and it killed the ferrets.
[01:17:15.431 --> 01:17:21.034]  They were testing it just to see if the regular flu vaccine had been irradiated, because if the ferret gets sick, they know it hasn't been irradiated properly.
[01:17:21.534 --> 01:17:22.635]  But it said the ferrets died.
[01:17:22.675 --> 01:17:24.175]  This is mainstream news.
[01:17:24.576 --> 01:17:25.836]  This is deadly bird flu.
[01:17:25.856 --> 01:17:27.477]  They were trying to mutate.
[01:17:28.197 --> 01:17:30.699]  But let's just go ahead and go to Dr. Rebecca Carley.
[01:17:31.939 --> 01:17:32.719]  Tell us what's happening.
[01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.841]  Basically, they're trying to cause the pandemic.
[01:17:36.348 --> 01:17:41.150]  They have already stockpiled at least 250 million doses of the bird flu vaccine.
[01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:48.693]  Um, you know, the, uh, the shelf life of that vaccine has a certain amount of time by which they'll have to throw in the garbage.
[01:17:49.113 --> 01:17:55.256]  So they have to start the pandemic so that they can give the vaccine, which will then cause the bird flu pandemic.
[01:17:55.656 --> 01:17:58.157]  I encourage all of your listeners to go to my website, drcarley.com
[01:18:00.233 --> 01:18:02.594]  D-R-C-A-R-L-E-Y dot com.
[01:18:02.934 --> 01:18:08.797]  Go to the bottom of my site and you will actually see posted an article entitled, U.S.
[01:18:08.857 --> 01:18:12.078]  Controls Bird Flu Vaccines Over Bioweapon Fears.
[01:18:12.618 --> 01:18:25.904]  In fact, this is an Associated Press article that says that our government is reluctant to give bird flu vaccines to some of the rogue nations for fear they will use the vaccine as biological warfare.
[01:18:26.482 --> 01:18:30.566]  So when you actually look at what's out there, folks, it becomes crystal clear.
[01:18:30.887 --> 01:18:32.048]  This is genocide.
[01:18:32.068 --> 01:18:35.852]  This is population reduction, and it's happening right now.
[01:18:35.872 --> 01:18:37.294]  Alright, let me stop you right there.
[01:18:37.334 --> 01:18:40.958]  You just brought a huge piece of the puzzle that I wasn't even aware of.
[01:18:41.018 --> 01:18:42.299]  We Googled it, it's true.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:47.123]  I have the AP article about him admitting bird flu vaccine can be used as a bioweapon.
[01:18:47.523 --> 01:18:48.664]  Now this company in the U.S.
[01:18:48.744 --> 01:18:53.668]  ships it, doesn't tell the companies they're subcontracting to make regular flu vaccine that they're mixing it.
[01:18:54.128 --> 01:18:56.650]  By God's grace, they did a test and it killed the animals.
[01:18:57.070 --> 01:19:05.857]  They looked at it and said this is H5N1, the deadly stuff that would then become airborne by being mixed with the other flu.
[01:19:07.222 --> 01:19:07.782]  Vaccine.
[01:19:08.723 --> 01:19:12.425]  And here it is, homeless people die after bird flu vaccine trial in Poland.
[01:19:12.925 --> 01:19:14.146]  The London Telegraph, July 2008.
[01:19:14.306 --> 01:19:24.312]  This is three Polish doctors, six nurses are facing criminal prosecution for a number of homeless people died following medical trials of a vaccine to the H5N1 bird flu virus.
[01:19:24.332 --> 01:19:28.134]  I mean, this is, and they keep telling you you're a kook if you don't want to take vaccines, doctor.
[01:19:28.615 --> 01:19:28.855]  Right.
[01:19:29.275 --> 01:19:34.658]  Well, let me also say, you see, this is very intentional because the H5N1 bird flu virus
[01:19:36.295 --> 01:19:41.839]  is not actually able to be picked up by humans in a regular scenario.
[01:19:42.259 --> 01:19:49.124]  So by putting it with a regular human flu, they're intentionally causing it to create a hybrid virus.
[01:19:49.524 --> 01:20:00.392]  And this is how they're going to make the bird flu virus be contracted by the people because it's very virulent and basically the scenario that it creates is very disturbing.
[01:20:00.432 --> 01:20:04.755]  You actually bleed out into your lungs and suffocate on your own blood.
[01:20:07.694 --> 01:20:08.294]  Please continue.
[01:20:09.255 --> 01:20:10.956]  Okay, and I want to just make it clear.
[01:20:10.976 --> 01:20:18.621]  I encourage the listeners, once again, to go to my website, drcarley.com, and read the article I now have posted, Science of Vaccine Damage.
[01:20:19.061 --> 01:20:30.328]  We have a number of non-pharma-funded veterinarian researchers that have documented what I've been saying for 12 years, that it's not just the diseases themselves the vaccines cause.
[01:20:30.688 --> 01:20:35.631]  When you inject live viruses into the bloodstream, you bypass a critical part of the immune system,
[01:20:36.004 --> 01:20:36.744]  We're good to go.
[01:20:56.434 --> 01:20:59.756]  Not only humanity, our pets and our food sources.
[01:20:59.837 --> 01:21:01.197]  Well, doctor, I wanted to back you up.
[01:21:01.598 --> 01:21:11.184]  All these big veterinary university studies, as you know, have now come out showing thousands of percentile increases in the area where dogs and cats are injected.
[01:21:11.265 --> 01:21:15.247]  Everybody I know injects their cats and dogs and they almost die.
[01:21:15.267 --> 01:21:21.732]  They have seizures that causes, as other medical doctors have told us, autoimmune responses where the brain swells.
[01:21:21.832 --> 01:21:23.533]  That's causing actually mostly autism.
[01:21:23.873 --> 01:21:25.815]  The mercury is a side issue.
[01:21:26.595 --> 01:21:38.357]  And here they are trying to send out bird flu, mutated with regular flu for deadly airborne flu that kills over 60% of people that come in contact with it.
[01:21:38.837 --> 01:21:42.658]  And then meanwhile they're running billboards and ads everywhere saying vaccines are good, take more.
[01:21:43.158 --> 01:21:45.238]  HPV is killing a lot of the girls that take it.
[01:21:45.498 --> 01:21:48.899]  It's okay, dying is good, it keeps you safe, dying keeps you safe.
[01:21:49.259 --> 01:21:50.959]  I mean it's mass insanity.
[01:21:51.719 --> 01:21:54.360]  We're going to come back and talk about how this kills you.
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:56.701]  How do you think they're gonna release it?
[01:21:56.981 --> 01:21:57.861]  We're on the march.
[01:21:58.382 --> 01:21:59.963]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:22:00.903 --> 01:22:03.585]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:07.156 --> 01:22:10.519]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:22:10.679 --> 01:22:15.883]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:22:16.083 --> 01:22:20.847]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:22:21.228 --> 01:22:32.357]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:22:32.737 --> 01:22:38.299]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:22:38.519 --> 01:22:44.581]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:22:44.781 --> 01:22:45.422]  What about you?
[01:22:45.822 --> 01:22:51.864]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:23:06.592 --> 01:23:12.976]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:23:13.336 --> 01:23:14.998]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:23:15.976 --> 01:23:16.997]  But who is the enemy?
[01:23:17.517 --> 01:23:18.038]  Bin Laden.
[01:23:18.318 --> 01:23:19.239]  This is his M.O.
[01:23:19.259 --> 01:23:20.620]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:22.382]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:23:22.662 --> 01:23:29.448]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:23:29.828 --> 01:23:30.269]  Some U.S.
[01:23:30.309 --> 01:23:35.954]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:23:36.654 --> 01:23:40.155]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:23:40.175 --> 01:23:43.196]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:24:06.414 --> 01:24:10.276]  Do you suffer from aches and pains in your knees, arms, wrists, or elbows?
[01:24:10.596 --> 01:24:13.898]  Is it difficult to get out of bed in the morning because of joint stiffness?
[01:24:14.238 --> 01:24:17.619]  Have you been looking for a safe, natural alternative to help ease your pain?
[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:20.961]  If so, you need to visit solartherm.ca.
[01:24:21.301 --> 01:24:28.925]  SolarTherm, the pain care you wear, is a patented ceramic fiber support technology that holds in and reflects your own body heat.
[01:24:29.165 --> 01:24:30.566]  Soothing those sore areas.
[01:24:30.846 --> 01:24:37.411]  Solar Therm is extremely light and comfortable to wear and increases blood flow to the affected areas without the use of toxic chemicals.
[01:24:37.751 --> 01:24:43.395]  Imagine being able to finally relieve the aches and pains in your elbows, knees, wrists, back and more.
[01:24:43.596 --> 01:24:46.217]  So forget about messy creams that have an unpleasant smell.
[01:24:46.498 --> 01:24:48.279]  Try Solar Therm, the pain care you
[01:24:48.339 --> 01:24:48.619]  I think?
[01:25:13.644 --> 01:25:15.284]  There is so much evidence of this.
[01:25:15.344 --> 01:25:17.265]  It's right out in the open.
[01:25:17.405 --> 01:25:19.425]  They give it to homeless people and it kills them.
[01:25:20.445 --> 01:25:30.267]  Another company ships it to all these labs, doesn't tell them what it is, tells them, oh here's the mixes, mislabels it, has them mix it with all these different strains of regular flu.
[01:25:31.027 --> 01:25:36.648]  They admit that it will mutate inside the growing process and mutate inside the human body.
[01:25:37.148 --> 01:25:40.509]  Airborne super flu that kills you
[01:25:41.983 --> 01:25:43.465]  And we just lost Dr. Carly.
[01:25:44.006 --> 01:25:45.408]  I just heard her disconnect.
[01:25:45.508 --> 01:25:47.191]  So, John, will you get her back on, or is she still there?
[01:25:50.736 --> 01:25:51.677]  Oh, the ISDN dropped.
[01:25:51.758 --> 01:25:52.018]  Okay.
[01:25:52.038 --> 01:25:53.059]  Alright, well, we're here.
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:53.560]  It doesn't matter.
[01:25:54.121 --> 01:25:56.685]  Okay, let's get the guys in there and get that reconnected.
[01:25:57.719 --> 01:26:24.485]  Doctor, break this down for folks, how it kills you, what's going on, and the larger picture, with all the documentation you've got, and she neurotically goes through all, even mainstream documents, mainstream news, and by the grace of God, a subcontractor tested the flu shots, because they've had so many people get killed in Europe from them, on ferrets, and it killed them better than a hammer, so they tested it and freaked out, saying, what on earth is this?
[01:26:25.226 --> 01:26:26.026]  This is incredible.
[01:26:33.843 --> 01:26:36.248]  Yeah, we're having some phone systems go up and down.
[01:26:36.569 --> 01:26:38.032]  Get her back on for me, okay?
[01:26:41.598 --> 01:26:44.699]  I don't think it's the government doing it, though they admit they've done sabotage on the people.
[01:26:44.759 --> 01:26:47.560]  This always happens when, and now, Jesse Ventura.
[01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:48.681]  Happens like once a month.
[01:26:49.041 --> 01:26:50.561]  But it's always, and now Willie Nelson.
[01:26:51.602 --> 01:26:52.602]  And now Jesse Ventura.
[01:26:53.402 --> 01:26:56.143]  And now we will expose the bird flu plan.
[01:26:57.244 --> 01:27:00.465]  And we've got like three backups in there, so hopefully that'll get it fixed.
[01:27:01.085 --> 01:27:04.606]  So we will get her back up and on the line.
[01:27:05.086 --> 01:27:06.867]  Okay, Dr. Carley, did you hear my questions?
[01:27:08.610 --> 01:27:12.031]  As I said, strange things happen when I do shows like this.
[01:27:12.311 --> 01:27:16.272]  I just want to mention a couple of very important things that people have to realize.
[01:27:16.652 --> 01:27:27.695]  First of all, there's been almost a billion dollars, with a B, $954 million has been put aside in the stimulus package for further inoculations.
[01:27:28.375 --> 01:27:35.017]  And as people are listening to our corrupt Congress in the District of Criminals talking about mandated health insurance,
[01:27:35.356 --> 01:27:43.000]  You have to realize that just like they're doing in Massachusetts now, they're going to tell you what you need to do in terms of your health, quote unquote, coverage.
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:44.320]  It's actually death coverage.
[01:27:44.761 --> 01:27:46.261]  And so this is what's going on.
[01:27:46.341 --> 01:27:48.502]  This is a population reduction agenda.
[01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:56.886]  One other quick thing I just wanted to mention is that there's at least nine biowarfare or weapons labs in every state at this point.
[01:27:57.186 --> 01:28:01.829]  And the way they ship their viruses from lab to lab is by Federal Express.
[01:28:02.289 --> 01:28:04.530]  So as they're trying to tell us that we have all these
[01:28:04.966 --> 01:28:05.206]  Yes, I do.
[01:28:05.246 --> 01:28:06.348]  That's how I found out about this.
[01:28:26.914 --> 01:28:41.017]  Alright, well as a medical doctor, as a surgeon, as someone who's been researching this in depth for years, tell us what the bird flu will do if it goes airborne or if people would have taken these shots that killed the ferrets, how this kills you.
[01:28:41.397 --> 01:28:46.278]  I see different news reports of that it kills 60-90% of people that come in contact with it.
[01:28:47.119 --> 01:28:52.900]  Well what people have to realize is that they've intentionally weaponized this by going up to Alaska
[01:28:53.351 --> 01:29:00.555]  And digging up dead bodies that died, uh, uh, people that died from the 1918 Spanish flu, which was not a Spanish flu at all.
[01:29:00.615 --> 01:29:04.818]  It was actually caused by inoculations given to soldiers in world war one.
[01:29:05.218 --> 01:29:20.147]  And since it was such a killer, um, these minions from the, uh, department of army pathology in Washington went there and dug up those dead bodies and brought that those lung tissues back and, uh, you know, did the DNA deconstruction on it.
[01:29:20.549 --> 01:29:26.815]  And they have combined that with the bird flu in order to make a pathogen which is going to kill young people.
[01:29:27.175 --> 01:29:29.217]  That is the very serious aspect of this.
[01:29:29.598 --> 01:29:35.063]  This is not going to just kill, you know, the young and the old as usually happens with different pathogens.
[01:29:35.403 --> 01:29:40.368]  This is going to specifically target young people in the ages of, say, 20 to 60.
[01:29:41.369 --> 01:29:45.032]  And this is going to basically cause you to, as I said,
[01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:47.668]  Bleed out into your own lungs.
[01:29:47.688 --> 01:29:49.349]  You're going to suffocate on your own blood.
[01:29:49.649 --> 01:29:56.953]  And the aerosolization aspect of it is not just with chemtrails and things of that nature.
[01:29:57.413 --> 01:30:04.017]  If people in your neighborhood are stupid enough to get injected with this insane vaccine, they're going to be coughing and sneezing on you.
[01:30:04.557 --> 01:30:06.998]  And so that's part of the aerosolization thing.
[01:30:07.278 --> 01:30:13.882]  They're going to be able to make this pandemic happen very quickly once they introduce this into the United States population.
[01:30:16.753 --> 01:30:17.353]  Absolutely.
[01:30:17.393 --> 01:30:22.456]  I want to show the viewers out there the headline, uh, flu pandemic can kill 1 billion people around the world.
[01:30:22.877 --> 01:30:33.323]  This is in the Journal of Nature and a bunch of other publications a few years ago, where they're out there fear-mongering, trying to get everybody scared, and then meanwhile I have the mainstream news
[01:30:33.843 --> 01:30:34.883]  And I see these all the time.
[01:30:34.904 --> 01:30:35.624]  You pointed one out.
[01:30:35.684 --> 01:30:38.685]  Homeless people die after bird flu vaccine trial in Poland.
[01:30:39.025 --> 01:30:39.926]  London Telegraph.
[01:30:40.326 --> 01:30:52.871]  And then I bring this up to listeners or people on the street or talk show hosts make fun of us saying, no, we can trust Big Pharma when Bayer admittedly shipped out over a million ampules of Factor VIII filled with HIV and hepatitis and didn't even get in trouble for it.
[01:30:53.111 --> 01:30:54.072]  And it came out in court.
[01:30:54.112 --> 01:30:58.454]  They knowingly did it on purpose because it's about population reduction.
[01:30:59.096 --> 01:30:59.316]  Yes.
[01:30:59.736 --> 01:31:09.979]  If anyone puts Henry Kissinger in Memo 200 into any search engine, you can read about how he testified in front of Congress that population reduction is a national security issue.
[01:31:10.139 --> 01:31:21.782]  The State Department memorandum, State Department memorandum 200, and the classified version, written in 73D, classified in 92, states that is the overall agenda of the entire New World Order is to kill people.
[01:31:21.822 --> 01:31:22.162]  Go ahead.
[01:31:22.242 --> 01:31:22.462]  Yes.
[01:31:22.922 --> 01:31:23.102]  Yes.
[01:31:23.462 --> 01:31:26.643]  They have to decrease the population because of the fact that
[01:31:27.068 --> 01:31:27.609]  I don't know.
[01:31:45.626 --> 01:31:52.029]  A large percentage of people, so that they can continue to make money in whatever endeavors they have available to them.
[01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:59.533]  And doctor, you know, you're a medical doctor, and I've had all these other medical doctors on about this, and they've caught them adding hormones to tetanus shots to sterilize women.
[01:31:59.753 --> 01:32:02.775]  Yes, I have documentation of that, let me just say.
[01:32:03.175 --> 01:32:05.836]  I'm writing a book about this, going to the genocide level.
[01:32:06.237 --> 01:32:14.621]  I have a book actually published by NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, entitled Immunological Adjuvants and Vaccines.
[01:32:15.014 --> 01:32:25.741]  Where they actually admit in that book that they are putting the hormone of HCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, into tetanus and diphtheria vaccines and giving it to women.
[01:32:26.221 --> 01:32:29.263]  That is the hormone produced by women when they become pregnant.
[01:32:29.656 --> 01:32:39.403]  So if you inject it into somebody, they become allergic to that antibody, they produce antibodies against it, and then they abort their own children when they become pregnant.
[01:32:59.976 --> 01:33:09.285]  And then they also, it's come out in mainstream news in Thailand, the UN comes in, forcibly injects the women three times with tetanus shots, everybody knows it's just one, while the baby's in them.
[01:33:09.485 --> 01:33:17.112]  I've seen the interviews of the women on Thailand TV in English, and they say, and then I feel the baby stop dancing, and a few days the baby dies.
[01:33:17.172 --> 01:33:24.039]  I mean, this is the savage murder, and the police, the military, you're all being injected.
[01:33:24.679 --> 01:33:24.899]  Folks,
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:29.571]  I premiered Endgame almost two years ago at the Alamo Draft House, and I'd seen this guy on TV.
[01:33:29.611 --> 01:33:31.075]  He was the press secretary for, uh...
[01:33:32.228 --> 01:33:33.969]  And the scheduler for Governor Perry.
[01:33:34.289 --> 01:33:38.751]  And Governor Perry's in the film, and he shows up and he says, hey, I'm Governor Perry, work for him.
[01:33:39.691 --> 01:33:41.892]  And he says, I just want you to know we're not all bad at the Governor's office.
[01:33:41.932 --> 01:33:42.813]  And I said, why are you here?
[01:33:42.833 --> 01:33:43.853]  And he said, well, here's my card.
[01:33:43.873 --> 01:33:45.214]  And I'd lost it.
[01:33:45.614 --> 01:33:59.340]  But the point is, and I get piles of these, he said, he said, well, I want you to know 12 years ago at Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, I'm a medic, and they sent us these, I think he said eight guys from Fort Bragg, and they injected them.
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:07.722]  And they all died in three days, and then we had to go in in decontamination suits, spray the whole room down with bleach, pull everything out, and decontaminate it.
[01:34:08.342 --> 01:34:09.723]  And I said, well, what are you going to do about that?
[01:34:09.743 --> 01:34:11.663]  And he goes, I don't know, but I just know you're telling the truth.
[01:34:12.183 --> 01:34:14.804]  And then we have all the declassified examples where they kill our own troops.
[01:34:15.064 --> 01:34:16.584]  The globalists are criminal.
[01:34:16.785 --> 01:34:17.165]  Go ahead.
[01:34:17.825 --> 01:34:25.807]  Well, I just want to state, that's the reason that we've had this big debate about whether or not they should be allowed to photograph the soldiers' coffins coming back.
[01:34:26.181 --> 01:34:31.587]  Because the news media may say, okay, what did that soldier die from and what did that soldier die from?
[01:34:31.927 --> 01:34:37.974]  And then it would come out that more soldiers are dying from their inoculations than are even dying from gunfire.
[01:34:39.232 --> 01:34:40.192]  And I've seen those numbers.
[01:34:40.233 --> 01:34:42.213]  Everything you're saying I've seen documented.
[01:34:42.233 --> 01:34:43.634]  And it's all mainstream.
[01:34:43.914 --> 01:34:45.795]  It's just a piece here, a piece there.
[01:34:45.895 --> 01:34:46.936]  Oh, it's killing the homeless.
[01:34:47.036 --> 01:34:51.518]  Oh, they accidentally put it... Here's the key about the manufacture of this vaccine.
[01:34:51.558 --> 01:34:53.399]  I specifically looked it up with this particular one.
[01:34:53.579 --> 01:34:56.581]  They're supposed to radiate the flu viruses.
[01:34:56.921 --> 01:34:58.882]  So they accidentally mix bird flu in it.
[01:34:59.522 --> 01:35:01.843]  Then they don't radiate it to keep it alive.
[01:35:02.463 --> 01:35:04.304]  Another accident, doctor, right?
[01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:05.565]  Yeah, right.
[01:35:06.991 --> 01:35:10.272]  Well, first of all, radiation can cause mutations.
[01:35:10.732 --> 01:35:14.052]  So radiation does not necessarily kill the viruses.
[01:35:14.372 --> 01:35:15.933]  This whole thing is a scam.
[01:35:16.393 --> 01:35:24.594]  People have to start asking themselves, if something is a dangerous pathogen, why am I going to inject it into my body?
[01:35:25.254 --> 01:35:33.796]  I mean, if you have somebody cough on you or sneeze on you, at least your immune system can work in a natural fashion, as the creator gave us,
[01:35:34.244 --> 01:35:37.187]  To create antibodies and give you lifelong immunity.
[01:35:37.627 --> 01:35:41.270]  And not to mention the fact of all the other additives that are in vaccines.
[01:35:41.650 --> 01:35:46.414]  I was so glad to hear you mention out that as far as autism, mercury is a side issue.
[01:35:46.715 --> 01:35:48.136]  Mercury is a toxic poison.
[01:35:48.216 --> 01:35:50.358]  It causes Alzheimer's along with aluminum.
[01:35:50.718 --> 01:35:52.600]  But you see all of these different things.
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:54.621]  Autism is an autoimmune disease.
[01:35:55.062 --> 01:35:57.564]  Actually, it's subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.
[01:35:57.604 --> 01:36:00.967]  They changed the name to hide the fact it was caused by vaccines.
[01:36:01.365 --> 01:36:04.467]  But all of these injections are causing you harm.
[01:36:04.767 --> 01:36:08.669]  And the more that you get, the more depressed your immune system is going to be.
[01:36:09.149 --> 01:36:19.935]  In my paper on my website, Inoculations are True Weapons of Mass Destruction, I describe exactly what the pathology is in the immune system that causes all of these autoimmune diseases.
[01:36:19.995 --> 01:36:23.937]  Well, I'm not a medical doctor, but you are, and I've interviewed many others, and it's simple.
[01:36:23.977 --> 01:36:24.998]  The mucous membrane
[01:36:25.947 --> 01:36:26.548]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:36:39.705 --> 01:36:40.586]  Scan its DNA.
[01:36:40.606 --> 01:36:42.987]  It's literally little nanobots God made.
[01:36:43.647 --> 01:36:46.889]  Eats it, scans it, and then goes out and starts programming the defense.
[01:36:47.490 --> 01:36:48.830]  So, it's like centuries.
[01:36:48.850 --> 01:36:49.591]  Alright, we've got an enemy.
[01:36:49.891 --> 01:36:50.471]  We killed one.
[01:36:50.511 --> 01:36:51.752]  This is what their uniform looks like.
[01:36:52.152 --> 01:36:53.173]  Here's how you take them down.
[01:36:53.413 --> 01:36:59.357]  And then it transmits the info through the lymph nodes, through the lymphatic system, total body defense system.
[01:36:59.797 --> 01:37:00.517]  Now they're ready.
[01:37:01.398 --> 01:37:04.860]  But instead, when they inject it, it all just bypasses the forces, doesn't it?
[01:37:05.458 --> 01:37:15.840]  Yes, well also secretory IgA, which is a very important antibody that's in the upper respiratory and GI tract is very important in this natural induced mechanism as well.
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:18.940]  But see, that's what people have to start asking their white coat.
[01:37:19.301 --> 01:37:27.922]  And I encourage everybody, like I said, print out that article, Science of Vaccine Damage, that the veterinarians have proven what the vaccines are doing to the immune system.
[01:37:28.262 --> 01:37:32.383]  And bring that to your veterinarian, to your pediatrician, to your
[01:37:33.286 --> 01:37:34.786]  Elderly Parents Nursing Homes!
[01:37:52.938 --> 01:37:55.960]  That's what Ross Perot brought forth when he ran for president.
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:58.823]  And they've got to get rid of the old folks, the UN openly says that.
[01:37:59.243 --> 01:38:01.445]  So it's a soft kill weapon to get them out of the way now.
[01:38:01.945 --> 01:38:05.468]  In the time we've got left, and I know I said I'd go to calls, but this info is so important.
[01:38:06.148 --> 01:38:20.499]  In the time we have left, Dr. Carley, you were going into the NATO documents, you even listed the book, where they admit they're doing all of this, and still the public listening, or when listeners tell their friends and family, hopefully they'll pass around this video, we're also live at PrisonPlanet.tv,
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:24.421]  People watching, listen, you can't laugh at us anymore.
[01:38:24.481 --> 01:38:26.783]  You can't say it isn't happening.
[01:38:27.283 --> 01:38:29.744]  You know, the HPV is killing the women that take it.
[01:38:30.605 --> 01:38:31.365]  That is admitted.
[01:38:31.725 --> 01:38:33.366]  Listen, this isn't a joke.
[01:38:33.446 --> 01:38:36.268]  People quit laughing after their kids die, or they die, or they get sick.
[01:38:36.728 --> 01:38:38.609]  Please, these are eugenicists.
[01:38:39.169 --> 01:38:49.895]  Dr. Carley, explain to people what you think was happening with them trying to put the deadly bird flu in with regular vaccines, and how do you think they got caught?
[01:38:49.915 --> 01:38:51.296]  Did somebody inside blow the whistle?
[01:38:52.338 --> 01:38:54.679]  Well, obviously somebody inside blew the whistle.
[01:38:54.719 --> 01:39:02.780]  You see, the dark forces have their agenda and then the good guys occasionally win one for the good guys.
[01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:05.761]  And this is obviously what's happened in this situation.
[01:39:05.881 --> 01:39:18.424]  As I said, putting the bird flu virus in with the regular flu is actually what's going to make the mutation happen to create the hybrid that's going to allow the bird flu to infect the humans.
[01:39:19.011 --> 01:39:20.272]  And this is self-evident.
[01:39:20.592 --> 01:39:26.596]  I mean, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that all these viruses mutate.
[01:39:27.196 --> 01:39:34.021]  They admit openly that the reason they have to change the flu vaccine every year is because the vaccines are always mutating.
[01:39:34.041 --> 01:39:35.982]  And by the way, doctor, that's not your opinion.
[01:39:36.122 --> 01:39:38.103]  Up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:39:39.642 --> 01:39:55.834]  We have all the mainstream news articles admitting that they put this bird flu virus in with the regular viruses and that it was being done and that it would mutate and that there's no way that that is an accident.
[01:39:55.914 --> 01:40:04.501]  This is admitted that this was happening and that the way they told the companies to do it was the exact way to create the mutation.
[01:40:05.336 --> 01:40:05.957]  Exactly.
[01:40:06.337 --> 01:40:09.099]  And I want to just quickly bring it to the next level.
[01:40:09.119 --> 01:40:15.685]  I also have another book published by the NATO Life Sciences Division entitled The Biology of Aggression.
[01:40:16.085 --> 01:40:18.027]  And that's all about the rabies virus.
[01:40:18.447 --> 01:40:23.231]  They are now also putting rabies virus into many human vaccines.
[01:40:23.411 --> 01:40:26.934]  There's many movies out now that actually illustrate this.
[01:40:27.054 --> 01:40:34.420]  Quarantine is the best because in quarantine, they actually admit that the rabies virus is what's making these people become ghouls.
[01:40:35.069 --> 01:40:38.691]  This is going to get even worse, folks, and this is being done intentionally.
[01:40:38.711 --> 01:40:53.117]  That's right, the media always throws us in our face, like the government creates a cancer shot cure, and the inventor of it, it's I Am Legend, and then 99% die but 1% turn into these raving lunatics.
[01:40:53.778 --> 01:40:56.939]  Take the movie Serenity, where the government puts
[01:40:57.199 --> 01:41:02.481]  This stuff into the atmosphere that kills everybody, but then a small percent turn into these raving maniacs.
[01:41:03.081 --> 01:41:14.265]  And you're right, the Pentagon, Wired Magazine, their head futurist, Mr. Marshall, brags that they're also creating compounds to make the troops psychopathic killers.
[01:41:14.605 --> 01:41:16.546]  Then they give them an amnesiac.
[01:41:16.586 --> 01:41:18.426]  They're already doing this in Afghanistan as a test.
[01:41:18.987 --> 01:41:25.289]  And then now mainstream news came out and said, we're going to have everybody take these amnesiacs where we don't feel bad about who we are anymore.
[01:41:26.018 --> 01:41:42.667]  Yes, as a matter of fact, I was amazed that the mainstream media, I was listening to NPR one day and they were talking about a study done in Switzerland where they used the blood pressure drug propranolol to reverse a post-traumatic stress disorder.
[01:41:42.747 --> 01:41:46.829]  People that had been traumatized by something take this blood pressure drug.
[01:41:47.089 --> 01:41:48.470]  That's what people have to realize.
[01:41:48.670 --> 01:41:51.672]  Every single drug has a mental side effect.
[01:41:52.139 --> 01:41:57.945]  And now they're actually admitting that they can remove these traumatic memories with propranolol.
[01:41:57.985 --> 01:42:07.875]  So as your loved ones are being killed and maimed by the mainstream medical mafia, you can take this blood pressure medication and just say, oh, that's fine.
[01:42:08.355 --> 01:42:09.797]  I don't have a problem with that.
[01:42:10.250 --> 01:42:15.876]  Well, it literally is like a lobotomy, and they're saying they want to put statins in this drug and others in the water.
[01:42:16.276 --> 01:42:18.259]  They're now admitting they're going to medicate the water.
[01:42:18.899 --> 01:42:21.562]  I mean, Dr. Kim... They're doing it with fluoride.
[01:42:21.582 --> 01:42:27.889]  They're already doing it with fluoride, and they're also admitting that as we're flushing more and more drugs down the toilet,
[01:42:28.334 --> 01:42:32.137]  And down the sink, these are all being released into the water supply.
[01:42:32.257 --> 01:42:37.222]  Isn't it amazing, Alex, that nobody seems to be rising up to protest that?
[01:42:37.622 --> 01:42:44.188]  As far as the ecology and nature are concerned, why don't they have a problem with all these things?
[01:42:44.548 --> 01:42:52.214]  Because they've destroyed with drugs, admittedly, our normal human spirit of just burning, being alive, being intelligent.
[01:42:52.415 --> 01:42:53.456]  They're just drugged out.
[01:42:54.176 --> 01:42:55.918]  Oh my gosh, Dr. Carley, stay there.
[01:42:55.938 --> 01:42:57.439]  We're going to come back and get more into this.
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:06.028]  Ladies and gentlemen, they were putting live bird flu in with regular flu so it could go airborne.
[01:43:06.761 --> 01:43:10.402]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:43:10.462 --> 01:43:16.064]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:43:16.204 --> 01:43:20.245]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:43:20.545 --> 01:43:22.826]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[01:43:23.006 --> 01:43:28.888]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[01:43:29.008 --> 01:43:29.808]  We're good to go!

[01:44:06.161 --> 01:44:08.302]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:44:08.602 --> 01:44:12.043]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:44:12.204 --> 01:44:14.044]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:44:14.665 --> 01:44:17.406]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:44:17.706 --> 01:44:19.607]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[01:44:20.012 --> 01:44:20.553]  We're good to go.
[01:44:44.974 --> 01:44:53.640]  From tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library, my weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.

[01:45:04.747 --> 01:45:05.507]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:45:06.704 --> 01:45:09.325]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[01:45:09.925 --> 01:45:12.887]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[01:45:13.247 --> 01:45:16.668]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[01:45:17.028 --> 01:45:23.211]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[01:45:23.611 --> 01:45:28.653]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[01:45:28.833 --> 01:45:35.536]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.

[01:46:14.517 --> 01:46:16.700]  I'm going to get Dr. Blaylock on about this next week.
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:17.841]  I'm going to get Dr. Carley back on.
[01:46:17.901 --> 01:46:24.108]  I'm going to get a bunch of medical doctors on so you can hear the same thing from different medical doctors with all the documents, all the articles.
[01:46:24.128 --> 01:46:28.873]  We're going to do a whole show on FEMA camps next week as well, just where I go through all the documents, all the videos.
[01:46:29.414 --> 01:46:31.956]  We cover a piece here, a piece there as it comes out in the news.
[01:46:31.976 --> 01:46:33.999]  We're going to be doing some big special reports.
[01:46:34.019 --> 01:46:35.600]  We're going to put a lot of work into these next week.
[01:46:36.601 --> 01:46:38.522]  The Obama Deception is on sale right now.
[01:46:38.562 --> 01:46:40.203]  It ships out in nine days.
[01:46:40.243 --> 01:46:41.104]  So get your copy.

[01:46:46.547 --> 01:46:46.927]  888-253-3139.
[01:46:47.127 --> 01:46:52.870]  We've got to expose this guy's a front man.
[01:46:53.211 --> 01:46:57.413]  He's doubled the funding for eugenics operations in Africa and Asia and Latin America.
[01:46:58.273 --> 01:47:00.014]  Poor brown folks think he represents them.
[01:47:00.034 --> 01:47:01.675]  He doesn't represent anybody but the New World Order.
[01:47:01.695 --> 01:47:02.316]  Dr. Carley?
[01:47:03.897 --> 01:47:07.119]  In closing, I think we've averted major disaster here.
[01:47:07.139 --> 01:47:16.104]  I mean, even mainstream Canadian, British, Czechoslovakian news is saying, was this, this is in mainstream news.
[01:47:16.164 --> 01:47:19.527]  When I first read it, the news was saying, was this done on purpose?
[01:47:19.907 --> 01:47:25.630]  Because this company's also developed a bird flu vaccine, but people keep dying in the test, with other companies that are testing theirs.
[01:47:25.670 --> 01:47:28.772]  We just covered the London Telegraph on that, with the people dying.
[01:47:30.697 --> 01:47:34.599]  I mean, this is miraculous that this did leak out and got stopped.
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:35.660]  Right.
[01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:37.701]  Well, of course, it's not in the U.S.
[01:47:37.761 --> 01:47:38.502]  mainstream media.
[01:47:38.542 --> 01:47:42.104]  Thank God for shows like yours that's bringing it out to the people of America.
[01:47:42.444 --> 01:47:45.025]  But I want to make it very clear, it's not just the bird flu.
[01:47:45.326 --> 01:47:51.109]  This is with all of these biological weapons, including Lyme disease and West Nile encephalitis.
[01:47:51.529 --> 01:47:53.430]  I have a book in front of me entitled Lab 257.
[01:47:54.827 --> 01:48:06.190]  The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Plum Island Germ Laboratory by Michael Christopher Carroll, where he quotes David Huxall, who was the Plum Island's director in June 2000.
[01:48:06.650 --> 01:48:18.933]  And this is what he said, Alex, and I quote, The plant that will produce biological agents for weapons purposes may not look too much different from the plant that produces biological agents for vaccines.
[01:48:19.674 --> 01:48:21.154]  This is all one and the same.
[01:48:21.494 --> 01:48:24.615]  Vaccines are a biological weapon, period.
[01:48:25.071 --> 01:48:27.092]  That's what people have to wrap their head around.
[01:48:28.853 --> 01:48:30.273]  Well, cancer's exploding.
[01:48:30.293 --> 01:48:33.275]  50 years ago, 1 in 33 died of it.
[01:48:33.295 --> 01:48:35.196]  Now it's 1 in 3 about to be 1 in 2.
[01:48:37.577 --> 01:48:43.979]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as dad runs, Planned Parenthood, the eugenics group, is openly involved in all of this.
[01:48:43.999 --> 01:48:45.580]  My film, Endgame, covers it.
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:50.142]  Dr. Carley, we're going to have you back up in the very, very near future.
[01:48:50.162 --> 01:48:51.383]  In fact, let me just have my producer
[01:48:53.535 --> 01:48:57.177]  Call your, one of the producers, call you right now and get you back on.
[01:48:57.817 --> 01:49:00.418]  But we will talk to you in the near future.
[01:49:00.438 --> 01:49:04.979]  We're going to link to your detailed reports at infowars.com to drcarley.com.
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:09.561]  And the key reports you've got up there posted, like U.S.
[01:49:09.601 --> 01:49:13.302]  controls bird flu vaccines over bioweapons fears and others.
[01:49:13.342 --> 01:49:14.403]  And we'll talk to you next week.
[01:49:14.423 --> 01:49:14.783]  Take care.
[01:49:15.216 --> 01:49:16.017]  Thank you so much.
[01:49:16.097 --> 01:49:16.637]  God bless you.
[01:49:16.657 --> 01:49:17.478]  Keep up the good work.
[01:49:45.576 --> 01:49:48.997]  Um, and like she said, when they really do this, they're going to be spraying it out of helicopters.
[01:49:49.057 --> 01:49:50.858]  They've got government operations doing that.
[01:49:51.338 --> 01:49:53.278]  The Sunshine Project broke in 2000.
[01:49:53.698 --> 01:49:55.259]  Plans to spray us with helicopters.
[01:49:56.099 --> 01:49:57.039]  And they do it to the military.
[01:49:57.119 --> 01:50:01.381]  I mean, just Google government test chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals on troops.
[01:50:01.481 --> 01:50:02.081]  Deaths result.
[01:50:03.041 --> 01:50:04.722]  Endgame covers it all, the mainstream news.
[01:50:04.742 --> 01:50:06.043]  I mean, they're just throwing it in our face.
[01:50:06.704 --> 01:50:13.969]  They kill us right in front of our face, and then we sit... They kill the troops that'll be spraying us, and the troops still follow orders and do it.
[01:50:14.650 --> 01:50:16.491]  Police, military, FBI, government.
[01:50:17.612 --> 01:50:18.873]  We were right about the New World Order.
[01:50:18.913 --> 01:50:19.894]  We were right about the banks.
[01:50:19.934 --> 01:50:20.634]  We were right about it.
[01:50:20.654 --> 01:50:21.655]  We're reading their documents.
[01:50:21.755 --> 01:50:22.876]  Please read their documents.
[01:50:22.896 --> 01:50:25.418]  They're all on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:25.438 --> 01:50:27.039]  They're all on the guest sites we bring on.
[01:50:27.119 --> 01:50:27.820]  It's the facts.
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:28.861]  I wish it wasn't true.
[01:50:29.381 --> 01:50:30.262]  I know it's crazy.
[01:50:31.411 --> 01:50:35.973]  Please, please realize psychopathic eugenicists run the country.
[01:50:35.993 --> 01:50:38.034]  Free transmission starts now at one place.

[01:50:58.348 --> 01:51:03.010]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:51:03.090 --> 01:51:05.832]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:51:06.052 --> 01:51:08.893]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:51:09.073 --> 01:51:13.796]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:51:14.036 --> 01:51:14.957]  If you simply prepare.
[01:51:15.157 --> 01:51:18.099]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:18.399 --> 01:51:25.303]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.
