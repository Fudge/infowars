[00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.311]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.932 --> 00:00:10.752]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.513 --> 00:00:12.513]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.093 --> 00:00:16.755]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.276 --> 00:00:21.318]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:24.383]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:24.684 --> 00:00:31.149]  This May the 8th, Friday 2009, I am Jason Vermas sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.191]  Alex will be joining us in about an hour.
[00:00:34.792 --> 00:00:40.776]  We also have Bob Chapman, Alan Watt, and Chris Pinto of the America's Secret Beginning series.
[00:00:41.417 --> 00:00:46.321]  Really a jam-packed show today, and I just want to hit some news points.
[00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:51.135]  Before we go to your calls, we're going to go to your calls for the entire first hour, believe it or not.
[00:00:51.175 --> 00:00:53.040]  Yes, a call-based talk show.
[00:00:53.582 --> 00:00:53.903]  It's here.
[00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:03.116]  Someone sent me this, and I knew about this civilian police force, but I didn't realize that the Marine Corps was the one that was backing it.
[00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:14.785]  You know, we've been talking a lot about the National Guard helping out to go after marijuana growers in Utah and Nevada, and now in New Hampshire, and then they're going to help us fight crime.
[00:01:15.365 --> 00:01:17.187]  But this program's been around for a while.
[00:01:17.227 --> 00:01:17.827]  We've reported on it.
[00:01:17.847 --> 00:01:20.790]  I didn't realize it was a Marine Corps program.
[00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.412]  And this is off USMCCLE.com.
[00:01:25.774 --> 00:01:27.996]  The Marine Corps is always looking for a few good people.
[00:01:28.216 --> 00:01:33.022]  If you have pride in yourself and what you do, the Marine Corps Civilian Police may be for you.
[00:01:33.803 --> 00:01:35.725]  The Marine Corps is looking for a few good people.
[00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:38.268]  In fact, they are looking for many good people.
[00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:45.876]  In June 2008, the Marine Corps adopted a plan to begin hiring approximately 1,200 civilian police officers.
[00:01:46.636 --> 00:01:56.212]  This expansion of civilian policing will reduce the operational stress on Marine Corps military police and will enhance security and police service across the Marine Corps.
[00:01:57.535 --> 00:02:20.980]  Since 9-11, of course 9-11, the reason for everything, you know, it's the reason for the Patriot Act, it's the reason for DHS, yeah, the Department of Homeland Security, that's all 9-11, even though they're not going after Islamic terror anymore, they're going after the alternative media, hacktivists, anti-illegal immigration, patriots, sovereign citizens, tax protesters, that's what DHS is about now.
[00:02:22.116 --> 00:02:25.019]  Did you listen when Alex Jones warned you almost ten years ago?
[00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:26.019]  No, you didn't listen.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.981]  You said, oh, God's nuts!
[00:02:28.642 --> 00:02:29.763]  Well, it's the real deal.
[00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:34.867]  We've been exposing these DHS Fusion Center documents like no other.
[00:02:35.328 --> 00:02:48.619]  And remember, since 9-11, all branches of the military have identified greater requirements for police and security to protect the property and the people that are responsible for the defense of the nation.
[00:02:49.804 --> 00:02:50.985]  Johnny Nonsense, folks.
[00:02:51.586 --> 00:02:53.087]  Johnny Nonsense.
[00:02:53.107 --> 00:02:57.732]  9-11... Folks, we haven't been attacked again for a reason.
[00:02:58.152 --> 00:03:02.076]  They haven't had drills with their black ops soldiers of running planes into buildings.
[00:03:02.116 --> 00:03:03.437]  That's why we haven't been attacked.
[00:03:04.118 --> 00:03:04.438]  Okay?
[00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:09.543]  And we exposed the fact that 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:03:10.824 --> 00:03:11.384]  That's right.
[00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:14.567]  It wasn't 19 guys from caves.
[00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.431]  It wasn't 17 Saudi nationals.
[00:03:17.811 --> 00:03:24.193]  Most of the people that came in through Saudi Arabia magically came in through a CIA front base.
[00:03:24.653 --> 00:03:25.253]  Let me say it again.
[00:03:25.593 --> 00:03:28.834]  A CIA front base in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
[00:03:29.055 --> 00:03:32.836]  We actually had the ex-head of the visa department go public.
[00:03:33.706 --> 00:03:46.957]  And say he was told to leave after he refused to give people visas who were part of a black ops program headed up by their asset, Osama Bin Laden, J. Michael Springman.
[00:03:48.398 --> 00:03:49.859]  And you can check that on Fabled Enemies.
[00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:51.600]  I mean, we go over it big time.
[00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:58.606]  It just, it rocks my world that they're still saying, we need Marine Corps Civilian Feliz cuz 9-11.
[00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:02.071]  It's just unbelievable!
[00:04:02.872 --> 00:04:11.121]  Limitations on growing the active duty force have resulted in the hiring of civilians to provide security and law enforcement services across the Department of Defense.
[00:04:12.162 --> 00:04:21.285]  The Marine Corps initiated the Civilian Police Force in 2005 and has established Marine Corps Police Departments in Albany, Georgia, Jacksonville, Florida, and Barstow, California.
[00:04:21.965 --> 00:04:28.867]  The new police officer hires are spread across four years with the target of hiring 400 police officers in these separate regions.
[00:04:28.887 --> 00:04:29.827]  I don't want to read them all off.
[00:04:30.308 --> 00:04:37.810]  As requirements increase and replacements are needed, it's the end of posi commentatus, the end of the separation of police and military.
[00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.497]  And just the outward police state coming home to roost, saying, we own you, shut up!
[00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.003]  Here we go, it's China all over again, folks.
[00:04:47.023 --> 00:04:47.944]  We'll be back after this.
[00:04:48.285 --> 00:04:49.106]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:51.910]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:02.072]  We're good to go.
[00:05:18.772 --> 00:05:19.252]  I think so.
[00:05:48.408 --> 00:05:52.229]  Ask yourself, why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?
[00:05:52.489 --> 00:05:54.850]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.031]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[00:06:01.211 --> 00:06:06.512]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:12.494]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.115 --> 00:06:19.297]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.617 --> 00:06:21.437]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.577 --> 00:06:23.958]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:06:24.038 --> 00:06:34.981]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.222 --> 00:06:38.462]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.903 --> 00:06:40.263]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:47.105]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.665 --> 00:06:55.451]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.931 --> 00:06:57.072]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.512 --> 00:06:58.673]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:02.730]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel from Midas Resources.
[00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.574]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[00:07:06.674 --> 00:07:09.317]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:07:09.498 --> 00:07:16.686]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[00:07:16.826 --> 00:07:21.831]  Having your hard-earned money in banks, the stock market, or any other paper asset is a lose-lose deal.
[00:07:21.911 --> 00:07:26.876]  You'll lose on your capital investment, and you'll lose purchasing power as the dollar continues to devalue.
[00:07:27.037 --> 00:07:33.163]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens, your investment will never be worthless.
[00:07:33.263 --> 00:07:37.266]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[00:07:37.427 --> 00:07:42.431]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:07:43.231 --> 00:07:48.156]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[00:07:48.276 --> 00:07:52.259]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:07:52.739 --> 00:07:55.221]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[00:07:55.382 --> 00:07:55.822]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:08:02.293 --> 00:08:08.327]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:11.915]  It's Alex Jones, and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.372 --> 00:08:19.858]  Alright folks, we're going to go to your calls in a moment, but I want to take this opportunity to thank one of our great sponsors.
[00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:20.738]  It's HomeGain.
[00:08:21.099 --> 00:08:24.782]  That's H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[00:08:24.843 --> 00:08:26.184]  HomeGain dot com.
[00:08:26.224 --> 00:08:29.167]  You go over there, it'll help you with all your real estate.
[00:08:29.207 --> 00:08:30.168]  It has the street view.
[00:08:30.188 --> 00:08:35.693]  I don't know if you guys have been to the latest in Google, but you can zoom down, you can check out the neighborhood, you can check out the property.
[00:08:36.434 --> 00:08:40.217]  You can also type in your address and get a free estimate on your home.
[00:08:40.257 --> 00:08:42.519]  And like I said, they're everything real estate.
[00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:43.880]  They help make this show possible.
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.122]  Go visit them at homegain.com.
[00:08:46.142 --> 00:08:49.645]  That's H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[00:08:50.565 --> 00:08:55.970]  Alright, we're going to go to your calls in just a minute, but I want to hit up some of the news that's new today.
[00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.872]  We're going to be playing a clip out of Sky News.
[00:08:59.813 --> 00:09:03.295]  We're talking to people in the, I think, the health department in the UK.
[00:09:04.685 --> 00:09:07.026]  And on this clip, he has a little Freudian slip.
[00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:13.230]  He's like, oh, well, the seasonal virus, I mean, seasonal vaccine will be ready.
[00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.271]  And you could see the guilty look on his face.
[00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:25.976]  We'll probably play it in the next couple of segments, but we'll definitely play it on PrisonPlanet.tv so you can see his guilty looking face, and that'll be in the third and fourth hours.
[00:09:27.337 --> 00:09:30.941]  On top of that, Mexico's Congress legalizes drugs for personal use.
[00:09:31.521 --> 00:09:43.151]  Mexico's Congress approved a bill Friday decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine, and heroin for personal use, a measure sure to raise questions in Washington about Mexico's commitment to the war on drugs.
[00:09:44.232 --> 00:09:48.957]  We also have another clip of, I believe it is Representative King.
[00:09:50.049 --> 00:09:55.134]  He is a congressman and he's saying, oh, mandatory drug testing for all U.S.
[00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:55.695]  citizens.
[00:09:56.335 --> 00:09:58.477]  Not for jobs, for U.S.
[00:09:58.878 --> 00:09:59.298]  citizens.
[00:09:59.338 --> 00:10:00.019]  They want to know.
[00:10:00.219 --> 00:10:01.520]  And you've got nothing to hide.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.502]  You should take your mandatory drug test.
[00:10:04.303 --> 00:10:05.884]  Give me a break.
[00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:07.226]  Disgusting.
[00:10:08.373 --> 00:10:09.715]  This one's out of World Net Daily.
[00:10:10.075 --> 00:10:12.679]  Suspect detained over extremist bumper sticker.
[00:10:12.859 --> 00:10:16.003]  Yes, the Don't Tread On Me bumper sticker that we reported on.
[00:10:16.043 --> 00:10:18.626]  We told you the MIAC document wasn't the only one.
[00:10:19.127 --> 00:10:21.250]  Ron Paul bumper stickers aren't the only one.
[00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.112]  American bumper stickers aren't the only one.
[00:10:23.132 --> 00:10:23.893]  The Don't Tread On Me.
[00:10:24.614 --> 00:10:35.180]  Yes, a Louisiana driver was stopped and detained for having a Don't Tread On Me bumper sticker on his vehicle and warned by a police officer about the subversive message it sent, according to the driver's relative.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:49.428]  The situation developed in the small town of Ball, Louisiana, where a receptionist at the police department told WND she knew nothing about the traffic stop during which the suspect was investigated for extremist activities, the relative said.
[00:10:49.848 --> 00:10:50.829]  Do you understand?
[00:10:50.969 --> 00:10:54.011]  They don't make these documents not to arrest and detain people.
[00:10:54.511 --> 00:10:55.492]  That's what they're for!
[00:10:56.012 --> 00:10:57.753]  They're there to criminalize you!
[00:10:57.833 --> 00:10:58.894]  To demonize you!
[00:10:59.054 --> 00:11:00.115]  To arrest you!
[00:11:00.955 --> 00:11:01.235]  You!
[00:11:01.415 --> 00:11:01.916]  The listener!
[00:11:02.016 --> 00:11:02.656]  Do you get it?
[00:11:03.217 --> 00:11:05.098]  You got America Freedom to Fascism in the back?
[00:11:05.378 --> 00:11:06.138]  You're a bad guy!
[00:11:06.258 --> 00:11:07.859]  You're handing out zeitgeist to your friend?
[00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:08.400]  Guess what?
[00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:12.319]  You're probably a extremist, racist, terrorist!
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.243]  And they just keep piling these things on and then just denying that they were ever authorized.
[00:11:17.263 --> 00:11:26.610]  It doesn't matter if our latest DHS document is marked March 26th, was in circulation for a month before it broke in the alternative media, which they demonize right off the bat.
[00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:27.931]  It doesn't matter.
[00:11:28.251 --> 00:11:31.553]  They just say, oh, we never actually authorized it, it's not real, go back to sleep.
[00:11:32.534 --> 00:11:32.834]  Bull.
[00:11:33.715 --> 00:11:33.975]  Bull.
[00:11:34.035 --> 00:11:35.496]  And they are really arresting people.
[00:11:35.536 --> 00:11:35.877]  In fact,
[00:11:36.812 --> 00:11:45.155]  Last night on my program, I played the clip of the young 17-year-old girl who called 911 because her father was having a seizure.
[00:11:45.655 --> 00:11:46.675]  Having a seizure.
[00:11:46.835 --> 00:11:47.836]  She thought he was going to die.
[00:11:49.156 --> 00:11:52.777]  And the guy hangs up on her three times because she uses the F word.
[00:11:53.898 --> 00:11:55.358]  Ooh, the F word.
[00:11:55.418 --> 00:11:56.579]  Aren't we all adults here?
[00:11:56.979 --> 00:11:57.839]  Big deal.
[00:11:58.339 --> 00:12:05.182]  She literally runs down about four blocks to the police station only to be arrested.
[00:12:05.822 --> 00:12:06.162]  Sickening.
[00:12:07.367 --> 00:12:07.727]  Sickening.
[00:12:08.708 --> 00:12:11.490]  And then you got these other people going to protest Scientology.
[00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:16.133]  They don't even get within 400 yards of the Scientology church on a public sidewalk.
[00:12:17.014 --> 00:12:18.275]  One of them is immediately arrested.
[00:12:19.015 --> 00:12:22.678]  The others are told they can't wear masks and they will be arrested if they don't turn around.
[00:12:22.978 --> 00:12:24.839]  We're going to play both of those clips for you coming up.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.400]  But I promised I'd go to your calls.
[00:12:26.761 --> 00:12:28.902]  So let's go to Freeburger in Virginia.
[00:12:28.922 --> 00:12:29.463]  You're on the line.
[00:12:31.044 --> 00:12:31.304]  Yes, sir.
[00:12:32.592 --> 00:12:35.894]  Uh, Mr. Bermas, it's, uh, Freyberger from last night.
[00:12:36.274 --> 00:12:36.594]  Yes?
[00:12:36.614 --> 00:12:48.421]  I wanted to follow up, uh, you didn't happen to check out that EnterpriseCorruption.com or that, uh, that World Disaster, uh, Congressional World Congress deal, did you?
[00:12:48.781 --> 00:13:00.007]  Not yet, I mean, dude, I got home at like 1 o'clock in the morning, I went to sleep, took my dogs out, got here at like 10, and I just went through my Facebook tips and, uh, whatever my producer gave me, to be honest.
[00:13:01.277 --> 00:13:03.199]  Well, if you don't mind, if I could just toss that website.
[00:13:03.219 --> 00:13:03.839]  Sure, go for it.
[00:13:03.859 --> 00:13:04.199]  It's WCDEM2009.org.
[00:13:04.219 --> 00:13:07.162]  Also, that guy, EnterpriseCorruption.com, alludes to this other group, Legatus.
[00:13:07.222 --> 00:13:08.703]  His quote is,
[00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:32.584]  I don't know.
[00:13:33.165 --> 00:13:35.366]  You'd have to do a lot of research.
[00:13:35.406 --> 00:13:37.367]  I'll try to check that out in between shows today.
[00:13:37.387 --> 00:13:38.287]  WCDE.
[00:13:38.387 --> 00:13:39.287]  I actually did write it down.
[00:13:39.327 --> 00:13:40.308]  It's sitting right here in front of me.
[00:13:40.328 --> 00:13:41.528]  So I will check that out.
[00:13:41.548 --> 00:13:44.990]  I haven't made a big deal about the Bilderberg Conference and it's only a week away.
[00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.111]  It does look like it's going to be in Greece.
[00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:48.852]  People were saying it's a month away, two months away.
[00:13:49.172 --> 00:13:49.612]  No, wait a minute.
[00:13:49.632 --> 00:13:50.553]  It's supposed to be in May.
[00:13:50.573 --> 00:13:51.614]  It was in May last year.
[00:13:51.834 --> 00:13:52.754]  The time just flies.
[00:13:52.794 --> 00:13:59.499]  But yeah, apparently Bilderberg is going to be in about six days, May 14th to May 17th, three-day weekend.
[00:14:00.019 --> 00:14:01.020]  And we'll see what happens there.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.903]  We should really keep up on that, be on the lookout for, you know, a public release of who's going to be there.
[00:14:05.923 --> 00:14:07.704]  We've got to make a big deal out of the Bilderberg.
[00:14:07.984 --> 00:14:09.745]  We always have to make a big deal out of the Bilderberg.
[00:14:09.785 --> 00:14:12.087]  And we will be getting inside information from Jim Duck.
[00:14:12.367 --> 00:14:14.608]  Jim Tucker, maybe we can get Estalon on the program.
[00:14:14.928 --> 00:14:15.709]  We're not quite sure.
[00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:16.969]  I thank you for the call, Freeburger.
[00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.771]  Let's jump to Matt in Washington, D.C.
[00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:20.811]  Matt, you're on the line.
[00:14:22.052 --> 00:14:22.752]  Oh, Matt dropped off.
[00:14:22.772 --> 00:14:24.193]  Let's go to Carl in Wyoming.
[00:14:24.213 --> 00:14:24.853]  Carl, you're on the line.
[00:14:33.051 --> 00:14:34.513]  Oh, well, I wonder who that must have been.
[00:14:34.673 --> 00:14:35.033]  Geez.
[00:14:35.714 --> 00:14:37.516]  Let's be honest, folks.
[00:14:37.936 --> 00:14:38.897]  80% isn't my number.
[00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:40.559]  It's their number.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:47.506]  Let's bring up the article where the right-hand man of Gordon Brown wants to take the population.
[00:14:47.646 --> 00:14:52.631]  He literally says he wants to take the population of 70 million right now, within the next 20 years to 30 million.
[00:14:52.651 --> 00:14:53.572]  I mean, are you retarded?
[00:14:53.872 --> 00:14:55.033]  Do you understand what that means?
[00:14:55.794 --> 00:15:04.572]  In order to take it to 30 million from 70 million, right there publicly, you have to have a 60% population reduction in the UK.
[00:15:04.833 --> 00:15:05.494]  I didn't say it!
[00:15:06.653 --> 00:15:07.793]  I think it's Alistair Darling.
[00:15:07.833 --> 00:15:09.154]  I'm not sure if it's Alistair Darling.
[00:15:09.314 --> 00:15:09.874]  We're going to bring it.
[00:15:09.934 --> 00:15:11.014]  It is Alistair Darling, isn't it?
[00:15:11.414 --> 00:15:13.654]  Oh, you're bringing up the clip right now, the article?
[00:15:13.995 --> 00:15:17.935]  So, you know, again, we all know who that was, anybody who listens to the program.
[00:15:18.115 --> 00:15:23.917]  And I'm sorry that you're in denial that these world leaders talk about how they want to kill a bunch of us.
[00:15:24.797 --> 00:15:25.937]  It's called reality, sir.
[00:15:26.817 --> 00:15:28.297]  It's unfortunate that that is the reality.
[00:15:28.317 --> 00:15:32.358]  Then you have people out in Australia saying they want to take the population from 22 million to 7 million.
[00:15:32.858 --> 00:15:33.739]  You got Ted Turner.
[00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:34.979]  Pull the Ted Turner clip.
[00:15:35.899 --> 00:15:57.470]  You know, pull the Ted Turner clip, we're just going to have to play the Ted Turner clip in the next segment, where he says that global warming is going to cause the temperature to go up 8 degrees, and we're all going to die, and then the people that are left are going to become cannibals, and we're all going to be in a failed state by Somalia, and then he literally says the reason that we have global warming is there are too many people on the Earth.
[00:15:58.496 --> 00:16:00.337]  We need population sustainability.
[00:16:00.738 --> 00:16:13.488]  And that's why I'm against things like the World Sustainability Society, which, of course, Obama's climate czar, the global warming czar that he hired, is also a member, with our good friend, Gordon Brown.
[00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:17.271]  Population sustainability means they want to kill a bunch of us.
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:37.351]  But, you know, Carl in Wyoming wouldn't know that because, you know, he doesn't understand that Baxter, the people that they are going to give the vaccine, and if you don't think that they're giving Baxter this vaccine contract, that's who they're talking about in this clip, this Freudian slip clip that we're going to play.
[00:16:37.591 --> 00:16:44.055]  Baxter gets caught sending out a vaccine to 14 separate nations with two types of live bird flu in it.
[00:16:45.031 --> 00:16:45.711]  Good morning, Jason.
[00:16:45.731 --> 00:16:50.872]  That last caller, he's living proof that critical thinking is no longer taught in the public schools.
[00:17:08.885 --> 00:17:11.248]  Let me tell you a little something about that last caller without naming names.
[00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:19.840]  Okay, that last caller is a spoiled brat who's in his forties and acts like a child because he was given to everything by his parents.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.543]  He's never had to work a day in his life outside of his family.
[00:17:22.944 --> 00:17:23.845]  Okay, he's always had money.
[00:17:24.045 --> 00:17:24.165]  Well,
[00:17:48.672 --> 00:17:58.257]  I know that Alex is taking well-deserved day off and I hope that he has time to go fishing or just anything else that has the ability to soothe the spirit because certainly he needs it and well-deserves it.
[00:17:58.297 --> 00:18:03.739]  I would say if you can, pull out Willie Nelson and play that song that says front porch sitting in an old rocking chair.
[00:18:04.239 --> 00:18:06.661]  That's apropos for that type of activity.
[00:18:06.681 --> 00:18:11.663]  You were talking about the Marines earlier and having civilians for policing service.
[00:18:12.322 --> 00:18:23.555]  I have a friend who is an Air Force Military Police Officer, active duty, and he recently told me within the last week that they have replaced all of the MPs on the base where he was
[00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:25.322]  With civilians.
[00:18:25.922 --> 00:18:27.082]  $15 an hour civilians.
[00:18:27.482 --> 00:18:33.425]  And the reason they're doing that is because they're going to use the MPs for security inside the United States.
[00:18:33.465 --> 00:18:37.327]  They're combining the police with the Marines, with the National Guard.
[00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:38.827]  They're ending posse comitatus.
[00:18:39.007 --> 00:18:44.450]  So they have to hire these civilians to do the job that our military was supposed to be doing.
[00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:47.631]  And all of his fellow MPs are being deployed.
[00:18:47.651 --> 00:18:49.051]  Where are they going?
[00:18:49.071 --> 00:18:51.232]  Are they going out to Afghanistan and Iraq?
[00:18:53.698 --> 00:19:01.942]  All but maybe one or two are going abroad, I'll just say that, and a few are going to remain stateside doing training.
[00:19:02.622 --> 00:19:03.863]  And that's as much as I can say.
[00:19:03.903 --> 00:19:19.911]  So they're going to be going into the NLE09 exercise, where our military is going to be integrated with the United Kingdom's military, with the Mexican military, with the Canadian military, with the Australian military, with private security forces, in a mass spying and roundup drill this summer.
[00:19:20.231 --> 00:19:22.133]  Coming to a country near you.
[00:19:22.213 --> 00:19:24.115]  Actually, FEMA Region 6 in this country.
[00:19:24.375 --> 00:19:25.497]  I thank you for the call, Mike.
[00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:27.499]  Let's go to Charlie in Tennessee.
[00:19:27.539 --> 00:19:28.560]  Charlie, you're on the line.
[00:19:30.071 --> 00:19:34.174]  Yeah, I was calling to tell you a story about the red light cameras here in Jonesboro, Tennessee.
[00:19:34.194 --> 00:19:37.356]  Alright, we'll talk about the red light cameras on the other side.
[00:19:37.416 --> 00:19:38.917]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:39.577 --> 00:19:40.458]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[00:19:40.758 --> 00:19:43.460]  Folks, this is dead set reality.
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:49.984]  I am sorry the real world can be a scary place, but I'm not going to ninny about it, suck my thumb and get in the fetal position.
[00:19:50.504 --> 00:19:52.706]  We'll be back with Charlie, Matt, Mike, and others.
[00:19:52.786 --> 00:19:56.028]  It's the Alex Jones Show, PrisonPlanet.TV, InfoWars.com.
[00:20:01.135 --> 00:20:02.995]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:20:03.115 --> 00:20:08.317]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:20:08.477 --> 00:20:09.817]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:20:10.077 --> 00:20:18.259]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:20:18.479 --> 00:20:24.200]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.161]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:20:26.221 --> 00:20:28.382]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:20:28.422 --> 00:20:32.764]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:20:32.944 --> 00:20:35.045]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:20:35.165 --> 00:20:42.988]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:20:43.188 --> 00:20:43.528]  We're good.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.001]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[00:21:04.381 --> 00:21:10.365]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[00:22:00.805 --> 00:22:06.107]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:06.608 --> 00:22:13.651]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:20.412]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:20.792 --> 00:22:22.612]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:22.752 --> 00:22:25.173]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:25.253 --> 00:22:36.236]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:22:36.824 --> 00:22:38.105]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:38.505 --> 00:22:39.886]  It's about a one world government.
[00:22:40.366 --> 00:22:46.709]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:47.269 --> 00:22:55.053]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:55.533 --> 00:22:56.674]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:57.114 --> 00:22:58.275]  The people strike back.
[00:23:00.014 --> 00:23:01.875]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.
[00:23:02.175 --> 00:23:09.058]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource on earth because it will provide healthy food now and every year after.
[00:23:09.318 --> 00:23:15.060]  Survivalistseeds.com now has the heirloom garden seed time capsule, allowing you to store your seeds for the future anyway.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:15.360]  We're good.
[00:23:35.382 --> 00:23:39.965]  Our competition charges $0.10 to $1.25 per seed for these same heirloom varieties.
[00:23:40.025 --> 00:23:47.691]  But you can now have a head of lettuce, a bundle of carrots, a basket of tomatoes, a giant watermelon, and 16 other varieties for about a penny a seed each!

[00:24:08.735 --> 00:24:10.736]  Alex Jones coming up in about a half an hour.
[00:24:10.756 --> 00:24:12.697]  I'm Jason Burmas sitting in.
[00:24:13.497 --> 00:24:14.977]  We've got Charlie in Tennessee on the line.
[00:24:15.017 --> 00:24:18.259]  But I want to show you these articles here.
[00:24:18.319 --> 00:24:20.900]  Obviously, PrisonPlanet.tv, not up yet in a couple hours.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.360]  It will be.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.641]  UK population must fall to 30 million.
[00:24:23.661 --> 00:24:26.262]  Remember, there's 70 million people there right now, says Porter.
[00:24:26.282 --> 00:24:35.045]  Jonathan Porter, one of Gordon Brown's leading green advisors, is to warn that Britain must drastically reduce its population if it is to build a sustainable society.
[00:24:35.385 --> 00:24:39.147]  When you hear the word sustainable, it means some of us have to die.
[00:24:40.107 --> 00:24:40.727]  Do you get it?
[00:24:41.267 --> 00:24:42.868]  Sustainability means death.
[00:24:43.788 --> 00:24:44.109]  Okay?
[00:24:44.389 --> 00:24:51.312]  The Trust will release research suggesting UK population must be cut to 30 million if the country wants to feed itself sustainably.
[00:24:51.632 --> 00:24:57.914]  That's why they're trying to pass all these, you know, carbon taxes and charge you for your carbon footprint.
[00:24:57.954 --> 00:24:59.435]  They want you dead.
[00:25:00.155 --> 00:25:00.435]  Okay?
[00:25:00.515 --> 00:25:01.176]  Or enslaved.
[00:25:01.676 --> 00:25:02.856]  I'm sorry that's the reality.
[00:25:02.956 --> 00:25:04.177]  I'm not the one writing this!
[00:25:05.503 --> 00:25:06.424]  We have to cut this by 80%.
[00:25:07.025 --> 00:25:09.568]  CO2, 80% they have to cut.
[00:25:09.588 --> 00:25:12.692]  80% and the population growth is going to make that much harder.
[00:25:14.312 --> 00:25:19.234]  Let's see, Britain's population is expected to grow from 61 million now to 71 million by 2031.
[00:25:19.775 --> 00:25:21.555]  I think it's already at 71 million.
[00:25:22.176 --> 00:25:29.139]  I think the 61 million doesn't include... I think that's a relatively... It wouldn't matter if it's 60 million.
[00:25:29.159 --> 00:25:30.700]  That's still a 50% cut.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.740]  A 50% cut!
[00:25:33.161 --> 00:25:34.201]  How is that going to happen?
[00:25:34.241 --> 00:25:37.123]  People would have to stop having children and drop dead.
[00:25:37.223 --> 00:25:37.643]  Half of us.
[00:25:38.263 --> 00:25:38.623]  That's it.
[00:25:38.943 --> 00:25:41.464]  And then Obama climate czar, and this is out of the Washington Times.
[00:25:41.484 --> 00:25:43.445]  That's out of the Telegraph, or Times Online, by the way.
[00:25:43.685 --> 00:25:46.186]  Two main, these are main line sources.
[00:25:46.226 --> 00:25:48.566]  They're telling you what they're going to do.
[00:25:48.887 --> 00:25:55.789]  Until last week, Carl M. Browner, President-elect Barack Obama's pick as global warming czar, because we need czars in this country.
[00:25:56.877 --> 00:25:57.718]  Yeah, and I'm telling you about that
[00:26:24.361 --> 00:26:31.156]  Only 35% of the money made off the red light cameras is going to the city, and the other is going to a foreign company that put them in.
[00:26:31.918 --> 00:26:33.662]  So, uh, Saturday we're having a protest.
[00:26:35.439 --> 00:26:37.861]  You know, that's actually not bad that 30% actually goes to the city.
[00:26:37.941 --> 00:26:42.745]  I've seen cases where it's less than 10% and it's really just a private money-making scheme.
[00:26:42.965 --> 00:26:44.266]  But the state loves it.
[00:26:44.286 --> 00:26:45.127]  You know why they love it?
[00:26:45.147 --> 00:26:53.453]  They love it because they get you ready for surveillance, they get the database information, has nothing to do with fighting crime, has nothing to do with paying taxes, has nothing to do with fixing roads.
[00:26:53.733 --> 00:26:54.974]  It's all about control.
[00:26:55.234 --> 00:26:57.276]  I thank you for the call, Charlie, and keep up the good work.
[00:26:57.296 --> 00:26:58.517]  You should be protesting that.
[00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:01.499]  Alright, let's go to Mike in Texas.
[00:27:01.579 --> 00:27:02.240]  Mike, you're on the line.
[00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:04.012]  Hey, this is Mike.
[00:27:04.152 --> 00:27:09.340]  I'm from Southeast Texas, Beaumont area, and I just have a little information for my area.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:17.712]  I was noticing this morning a vehicle out in the street, you know, just didn't look right in the neighborhood, and it's a regular civilian vehicle, and
[00:27:18.624 --> 00:27:20.205]  You know, I saw they had an orange vest on.
[00:27:20.245 --> 00:27:21.245]  Well, it was the Census people.
[00:27:21.665 --> 00:27:22.225]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:27:22.345 --> 00:27:25.446]  Finally, by the way, people are picking up on that Census story.
[00:27:25.466 --> 00:27:31.228]  World Net Daily is now talking about, oh yeah, by the way, the Census is coming, and there's not much you can do about it.
[00:27:31.928 --> 00:27:32.508]  Here it is right here.
[00:27:32.988 --> 00:27:34.669]  The article is from May the 5th.
[00:27:34.989 --> 00:27:36.950]  Census GPS tagging your home's front door.
[00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:43.211]  They plan on getting every single home within 40 feet, and there's nothing you can do about it, or so they say.
[00:27:43.471 --> 00:27:43.852]  Continue.
[00:27:43.872 --> 00:27:48.333]  Well, the thing is, you know, I was really polite to him, and he was really polite to me back.
[00:27:48.871 --> 00:27:51.732]  They're not coming to your house and letting you know their GPS.
[00:27:52.512 --> 00:27:54.913]  They're just driving by and GPSing.
[00:27:54.953 --> 00:27:55.613]  Well, I noticed.
[00:27:56.373 --> 00:28:00.294]  So I went to ask what was going on, because I was just concerned for my neighborhood.
[00:28:00.314 --> 00:28:05.715]  And I asked him to please remove my address from that GPS.
[00:28:06.675 --> 00:28:10.496]  And real nice fella, polite, we went through it.
[00:28:11.017 --> 00:28:16.538]  And, you know, so say, remove my address, you know, or bullet from the GPS.
[00:28:17.065 --> 00:28:28.148]  You know, which, eh, you can know there, but, um, anyway, that's, uh... Well, I'm telling you right now, even if he did it in front of you, you know, we had a caller in yesterday who had an 800-foot driveway.
[00:28:28.188 --> 00:28:30.009]  He was followed in by a census worker.
[00:28:30.049 --> 00:28:32.490]  He told the census worker that he wanted them to leave.
[00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.670]  They were very polite to him.
[00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:37.111]  She did leave, but she said, look, they're just going to send somebody else.
[00:28:37.171 --> 00:28:39.132]  We're GPS-ing this thing, whether you like it or not.
[00:28:39.392 --> 00:28:43.093]  It is the control grid they've been setting up for a while, and they're going full
[00:28:43.533 --> 00:28:44.754]  Force at this point, Mike.
[00:28:45.114 --> 00:28:45.835]  It's that simple.
[00:28:46.155 --> 00:28:47.016]  I thank you for the call.
[00:28:47.056 --> 00:28:49.298]  I mean, this now is really blasé to me.
[00:28:49.358 --> 00:28:49.938]  It's old news.
[00:28:49.978 --> 00:28:57.344]  I mean, we've now had calls for over a month about the Census Bureau coming, and now they're admitting that it's every single home.
[00:28:57.384 --> 00:28:58.385]  You want to live off the grid?
[00:28:58.405 --> 00:28:59.286]  You want to live in the woods?
[00:28:59.306 --> 00:28:59.986]  Not for long.
[00:29:00.507 --> 00:29:11.716]  They want this whole Google Earth, Street View, RFID population of total and complete control with a global currency that fits in a chip that goes in your arm.
[00:29:12.321 --> 00:29:13.762]  I'm sorry that that's the reality.
[00:29:13.822 --> 00:29:16.083]  I'm sorry that Verichip exists.
[00:29:17.003 --> 00:29:19.824]  I'm sorry that Digital Angel Corporation exists.
[00:29:20.144 --> 00:29:33.790]  I'm sorry we've got somebody out in the UK that is banning people from coming into her country and saying everybody needs an ID card and it doesn't much matter because 30,000 people already have it with the facial recognition scanning, with the biometric thumbprint.
[00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:35.991]  And they'll have 70 million by the end of the year.
[00:29:36.471 --> 00:29:39.832]  And that's her words, or I'm sorry, 70,000 by the end of the year.
[00:29:40.012 --> 00:29:41.353]  Those were her words, not mine.
[00:29:41.813 --> 00:29:43.355]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:29:43.435 --> 00:29:44.857]  Alex coming up in about a half an hour.
[00:29:44.877 --> 00:29:46.579]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.024]  Infowars.com.
[00:29:51.185 --> 00:29:52.066]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.567 --> 00:29:54.169]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:57.794]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.075 --> 00:30:07.901]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[00:30:08.201 --> 00:30:24.115]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[00:30:24.395 --> 00:30:29.560]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[00:30:29.761 --> 00:30:36.067]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[00:30:36.287 --> 00:30:39.931]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[00:30:40.191 --> 00:30:42.773]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[00:30:42.873 --> 00:30:48.239]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[00:30:48.539 --> 00:30:51.142]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:30:51.222 --> 00:30:53.425]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[00:30:53.445 --> 00:30:55.908]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:30:55.948 --> 00:31:00.293]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[00:31:01.535 --> 00:31:04.118]  In the New World Order's war against humanity.
[00:31:04.716 --> 00:31:06.857]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.578 --> 00:31:12.901]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.442 --> 00:31:19.646]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.946 --> 00:31:21.767]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.927 --> 00:31:24.309]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:34.115]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[00:31:34.591 --> 00:31:35.311]  That's fascism.
[00:31:37.553 --> 00:31:38.814]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.234 --> 00:31:40.615]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:41.095 --> 00:31:47.419]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:31:56.264 --> 00:31:57.405]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.825 --> 00:31:59.026]  The people strike back.
[00:32:00.731 --> 00:32:05.835]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[00:32:06.115 --> 00:32:14.402]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[00:32:14.682 --> 00:32:17.985]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[00:32:18.265 --> 00:32:21.207]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[00:32:21.487 --> 00:32:23.609]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?

[00:33:24.801 --> 00:33:26.482]  Alright folks, I promised you clips.
[00:33:26.822 --> 00:33:28.062]  I promised you phone calls.
[00:33:28.082 --> 00:33:29.623]  We're gonna go clips to phone calls.
[00:33:29.643 --> 00:33:30.803]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:32.444 --> 00:33:39.487]  And if you don't think population sustainability means death, listen closely what the lovely Ted Turner has to say.
[00:33:40.087 --> 00:33:47.690]  And then listen even closer to what the health officials in the UK are saying about Baxter and their delicious vaccinations.
[00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:47.950]  Hit it!
[00:33:49.391 --> 00:33:51.572]  Not doing it will be catastrophic.
[00:33:51.892 --> 00:33:59.858]  We'll have 8 degrees, we'll be 8 degrees hotter in 10, not 10, but in 30 or 40 years and basically none of the crops will grow.
[00:34:00.358 --> 00:34:03.220]  Most of the people will have died and the rest of us will be cannibals.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.761]  Civilization will have broken down.
[00:34:05.321 --> 00:34:13.887]  The few people left will be living in a failed state like Somalia or Sudan and living conditions will be intolerable.
[00:34:13.927 --> 00:34:16.529]  The droughts will be so bad there'll be no more corn growing.
[00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:20.831]  Not doing it is suicide.
[00:34:21.231 --> 00:34:24.632]  Just like dropping bombs on each other, nuclear weapons is suicide.
[00:34:24.973 --> 00:34:30.515]  So we've got to stop doing the two suicidal things, which are hanging on to our nuclear weapons.
[00:34:30.595 --> 00:34:35.597]  And then after that, we've got to stabilize the population.
[00:34:35.637 --> 00:34:37.137]  When I was born, there were too many people.
[00:34:39.278 --> 00:34:41.640]  That's why we have global warming.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.863]  We have global warming because too many people are using too much stuff.
[00:34:45.223 --> 00:34:47.485]  If there were less people, they'd be using less stuff.
[00:34:47.586 --> 00:34:48.606]  Alright, stop it right there.
[00:34:48.787 --> 00:34:49.267]  Right there!
[00:34:49.808 --> 00:34:50.929]  Too many people right now?
[00:34:51.229 --> 00:34:52.470]  Listen, I live in the woods!
[00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:55.773]  There can be a whole bunch more people, but they don't want that.
[00:34:56.013 --> 00:34:58.535]  He calls us useless feeders and eaters.
[00:34:58.655 --> 00:34:59.476]  Do you get it?
[00:34:59.756 --> 00:35:01.838]  He already said there's too many people today!
[00:35:02.796 --> 00:35:03.216]  Today!
[00:35:03.617 --> 00:35:04.998]  Listen, people have kids.
[00:35:05.578 --> 00:35:09.221]  They're not going to stop having children unless they sterilize us.
[00:35:09.301 --> 00:35:10.122]  It's human nature.
[00:35:10.462 --> 00:35:13.985]  Our population would grow, even with all the plagues they have put on this planet.
[00:35:15.066 --> 00:35:22.572]  Even their attack on third world nations like Africa, the population just keeps growing and growing and growing, and guess what?
[00:35:22.612 --> 00:35:23.532]  They don't want that.
[00:35:24.273 --> 00:35:31.138]  And remember, Baxter, the lovely people at Baxter, send out vaccinations with live viruses in them, and they're the ones that are going to save us from the swine flu.
[00:35:31.158 --> 00:35:31.438]  In fact,
[00:35:32.279 --> 00:35:33.660]  I covered this on the show last night.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.421]  WHO, here's some fear-mongering.
[00:35:35.441 --> 00:35:36.742]  This is the real fear-mongering.
[00:35:36.802 --> 00:35:44.067]  All you people out there that say I'm a fear-monger or Alex Jones is a fear-monger for reporting what's on the mainstream media, you're ridiculous.
[00:35:44.388 --> 00:35:44.588]  Okay?
[00:35:44.728 --> 00:35:45.629]  I'm not saying this.
[00:35:45.989 --> 00:36:01.540]  The WHO, who puts out pandemic alert guidelines where they say in section 1.5.1 that you have no human rights at all, no individual human rights, that's what it says, that you'll be forced to take compulsory vaccinations
[00:36:02.813 --> 00:36:05.235]  I mean, what, and quarantines.
[00:36:05.815 --> 00:36:06.536]  What don't you get?
[00:36:07.096 --> 00:36:07.837]  This is for you.
[00:36:07.877 --> 00:36:09.038]  This isn't for Ted Turner.
[00:36:09.098 --> 00:36:12.601]  Ted Turner's not going to be in a FEMA camp quarantine taking a shot.
[00:36:12.961 --> 00:36:13.582]  Are you sick?
[00:36:14.442 --> 00:36:19.787]  And then the WHO comes out and they say, up to 2 billion people might get swine flu.
[00:36:19.987 --> 00:36:20.067]  1 in 3.
[00:36:21.368 --> 00:36:22.569]  1 in 3!
[00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:24.931]  Those are biblical numbers.
[00:36:25.771 --> 00:36:29.074]  Let's say even a quarter of those 2 billion go down.
[00:36:29.114 --> 00:36:30.035]  That's a 500 million death.
[00:36:33.137 --> 00:36:34.978]  Half a billion death, if one in four.
[00:36:35.439 --> 00:36:35.979]  Is it one in four?
[00:36:36.059 --> 00:36:37.140]  Is that about right?
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:37.540]  One in four?
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:37.941]  One in three?
[00:36:38.021 --> 00:36:38.261]  I don't know.
[00:36:38.281 --> 00:36:38.921]  I'm all over the place.
[00:36:38.962 --> 00:36:41.083]  I'm just... I can't take it, folks.
[00:36:41.664 --> 00:36:42.664]  I just can't take it.
[00:36:43.425 --> 00:36:46.968]  These people are hyping up something that hasn't killed really anybody.
[00:36:46.988 --> 00:36:48.549]  You know, they said, and we're going to play that clip, too.
[00:36:48.569 --> 00:36:54.253]  We need to play that clip, that AP clip from last night, Jaren, that we played, where the woman... They said this woman died of swine flu.
[00:36:54.273 --> 00:36:55.134]  It's all over the media.
[00:36:55.474 --> 00:36:56.275]  Oh, second death!
[00:36:56.315 --> 00:36:58.176]  Remember, the first death wasn't an American citizen.
[00:36:58.436 --> 00:36:59.938]  It was a two-year-old child
[00:37:00.478 --> 00:37:06.401]  Who was a premature birth, had all sorts of health issues, and supposedly died in a Texas hospital of the swine flu.
[00:37:06.441 --> 00:37:07.642]  I don't know if I even believe that.
[00:37:08.102 --> 00:37:13.485]  And this 33-year-old teacher out of Texas, they stopped short of saying that she died from the swine flu.
[00:37:13.525 --> 00:37:14.645]  Doesn't matter, it's all over.
[00:37:14.685 --> 00:37:15.666]  Swine flu killed her!
[00:37:16.266 --> 00:37:17.587]  Swine flu killed her!
[00:37:17.607 --> 00:37:21.109]  And then they say, you know what, it might leave during the summer, but it'll be back in the winter.
[00:37:21.912 --> 00:37:22.873]  It'll be back in the winter.
[00:37:23.233 --> 00:37:25.915]  And that's what really this Sky News piece is about.
[00:37:25.935 --> 00:37:29.358]  They're asking him about Baxter doing the vaccinations.
[00:37:29.558 --> 00:37:30.098]  Let's play that.
[00:37:30.138 --> 00:37:32.900]  Let's just play it and we'll analyse it in a moment.
[00:37:33.201 --> 00:37:33.621]  Hit it.
[00:37:34.622 --> 00:37:42.508]  Create you a pandemic vaccine if required without impacting on seasonal flu vaccine production.
[00:37:42.928 --> 00:37:43.929]  We think it is.
[00:37:43.949 --> 00:37:46.230]  I've just told Parliament that's our objective.
[00:37:47.546 --> 00:37:57.856]  To have the vaccine ready, a pandemic-specific vaccine ready, without taking up the capacity that we need for the seasonal flu virus.
[00:37:58.457 --> 00:38:00.179]  Oh, the seasonal flu virus!
[00:38:00.419 --> 00:38:01.840]  Oh, the virus!
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:05.003]  Wait, wait, do you mean that they might be spreading the virus and the vaccinations?
[00:38:05.284 --> 00:38:09.428]  The guy's guilty look on his face is un-be-lievable.
[00:38:09.608 --> 00:38:15.809]  And remember, this woman, who supposedly died of the swine flu, the Associated Press won't even say that she died of the swine flu!
[00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:33.154]  Yet her face is all over the media, all over the papers, the papers that are failing, by the way, and now the Senate says, we're gonna save the mainstream media, we're gonna save the newspapers, we're gonna make them tax-exempt organizations, they're basically making them even more government-controlled than they already are.
[00:38:33.674 --> 00:38:36.774]  Let the Boston Globe fail, let the New York Times fail.
[00:38:37.235 --> 00:38:38.835]  All they've done is lie to us!
[00:38:40.168 --> 00:38:40.708]  My God!
[00:38:42.169 --> 00:38:43.651]  Alright, let's go to who are we on?
[00:38:43.671 --> 00:38:44.972]  We're on Anthony in Ohio.
[00:38:45.052 --> 00:38:45.712]  Anthony, you're on the line.
[00:38:47.353 --> 00:38:47.673]  Yes, sir.
[00:38:48.434 --> 00:38:49.455]  Hey, Jason.
[00:38:49.635 --> 00:38:50.696]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:38:50.756 --> 00:38:55.159]  The call you had earlier, who was making those stupid snickers, I'm not gonna say his name.
[00:38:55.678 --> 00:39:04.642]  I'm wondering if that's the same guy who travels from West Virginia 12 hours to Richard Gage events to hassle people.
[00:39:04.682 --> 00:39:11.945]  That's the guy that just wants to go around, travel with his big tubby belly, eat popcorn and watch his favorite baseball team.
[00:39:12.085 --> 00:39:13.986]  He's actually insane over there too.
[00:39:14.026 --> 00:39:17.668]  He's actually famous for being insane at baseball games because he is insane.
[00:39:18.629 --> 00:39:23.312]  Yeah, the same guy who follows baseball stars around in Stockton.
[00:39:23.632 --> 00:39:26.053]  Yeah, he's a professional stalker, really.
[00:39:27.734 --> 00:39:33.378]  But anyways, man, I just wanted to real quickly plug in an event we're having tomorrow here in Dayton, Ohio.
[00:39:34.018 --> 00:39:36.319]  We're doing an Obama Deception screening.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:47.326]  All the information, the times and everything, it's at noon, but it's in Dayton, Ohio, and if you go to WeAreChangeOhio, the address, the information to listeners that live in that area,
[00:39:47.796 --> 00:39:51.358]  Just bring some of your friends, we're having the event, and that's about it.
[00:39:51.758 --> 00:39:52.278]  All right, brother.
[00:39:52.318 --> 00:39:53.218]  Thank you so much, Anthony.
[00:39:53.238 --> 00:39:55.019]  And that's what you can do to be active.
[00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:56.460]  You say we don't offer solutions here?
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:58.561]  All's we do is offer solutions here.
[00:39:59.141 --> 00:40:00.461]  Get a copy of the Obamaception.
[00:40:00.681 --> 00:40:01.362]  Have a screening.
[00:40:01.402 --> 00:40:02.082]  Bring people in.
[00:40:02.142 --> 00:40:02.782]  Make copies.
[00:40:02.862 --> 00:40:03.423]  Hand them out.
[00:40:03.623 --> 00:40:04.763]  Join Campaign for Liberty.
[00:40:04.803 --> 00:40:05.764]  Become a state senator.
[00:40:05.804 --> 00:40:06.944]  Become a city council member.
[00:40:06.984 --> 00:40:07.604]  Run for mayor.
[00:40:07.824 --> 00:40:09.905]  These are all things you can do today.
[00:40:10.265 --> 00:40:10.606]  Today.
[00:40:10.926 --> 00:40:14.087]  So don't tell me that we're not giving out solutions to the problem.
[00:40:14.287 --> 00:40:15.888]  I'm sorry if the main thing that I can do
[00:40:16.408 --> 00:40:20.531]  Is only get on the radio show, make movies, and then hand them out for free to people.
[00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:21.832]  Put them on the web for free.
[00:40:21.972 --> 00:40:22.973]  That's why they're going after the web.
[00:40:23.013 --> 00:40:25.515]  That's why the Alex Jones Channel is shut down right now.
[00:40:26.195 --> 00:40:30.759]  That's why they froze my movie, Fabled Enemies, when I was number one in the world in the beginning of September.
[00:40:30.939 --> 00:40:32.680]  And number one in the world in September 11th.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:33.321]  They just pull it!
[00:40:33.361 --> 00:40:34.321]  They just pull my numbers!
[00:40:35.862 --> 00:40:37.644]  Alright, let's go to Matt in Pennsylvania.
[00:40:37.684 --> 00:40:38.224]  Matt, you're on the line.
[00:40:38.264 --> 00:40:39.445]  Alright, Mike in Pennsylvania.
[00:40:39.465 --> 00:40:39.805]  I'm sorry.
[00:40:39.845 --> 00:40:40.426]  Mike, you're on the line.
[00:40:41.018 --> 00:40:45.123]  Hi Jason, I wonder if you can help me find information that was on a show a couple weeks ago.
[00:40:45.184 --> 00:40:46.846]  A caller called in to Alex.
[00:40:47.406 --> 00:40:48.608]  I think he's from Alabama.
[00:40:48.748 --> 00:40:50.511]  He said that either he worked for
[00:40:51.443 --> 00:41:03.414]  uh... local police department our friend did and the feds came through and they said that they were going to be kind of taking over in august i can't find it looking on the website any kind of archiving and find a text from that call?
[00:41:03.434 --> 00:41:16.946]  You know what, we'll put the shout out out there if somebody can IM that to us or send it to robd at infowars.com i will try to bring that up there's just so much news that we go through those archives so quick and if you don't have the right day on those archives it's very
[00:41:17.426 --> 00:41:18.287]  Hard to find.
[00:41:18.307 --> 00:41:24.552]  But I mean, I'm reading right here, the Marine Corps Civilian Police, and I mean, it's been in place since June of 2008.
[00:41:24.992 --> 00:41:29.556]  We know we're having the NLE09 drill, which is to prevent a terrorist attack.
[00:41:29.576 --> 00:41:30.276]  First of its kind.
[00:41:30.457 --> 00:41:31.998]  Headed up by our good friends at FEMA.
[00:41:32.238 --> 00:41:33.339]  DHS approved.
[00:41:33.799 --> 00:41:35.461]  I mean, DHS integrated as well!
[00:41:36.201 --> 00:41:38.743]  And again, this is going to have foreign troops involved.
[00:41:39.284 --> 00:41:41.045]  We're working with all these other nations.
[00:41:41.245 --> 00:41:43.287]  The entire private sector is going to be involved.
[00:41:43.307 --> 00:41:48.211]  Who knows if that means Blackwater and AT&T and all the other little private companies they love to use.
[00:41:48.872 --> 00:41:54.717]  Okay, but we know it's going to involve all local government, all state government, even tribal governments.
[00:41:54.957 --> 00:41:56.778]  And it's going to be run by the Federales.
[00:41:56.818 --> 00:41:58.560]  And it's coming this summer.
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:00.782]  N-L-E-O-9.
[00:42:00.882 --> 00:42:01.863]  Go check it out.
[00:42:01.983 --> 00:42:03.104]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:42:03.464 --> 00:42:04.045]  Just go see it.
[00:42:04.625 --> 00:42:09.906]  You know, and you gotta wonder if NLE09 is going to coincide with yet another flu scare.
[00:42:10.807 --> 00:42:12.787]  Again, zero deaths here, but it's okay.
[00:42:13.047 --> 00:42:15.288]  Jaren, by the way, do we have that clip of the AP woman yet?
[00:42:15.588 --> 00:42:15.988]  No, we don't.
[00:42:16.008 --> 00:42:17.909]  Alright, we'll pull that up in the next segment.
[00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.869]  It's very short.
[00:42:19.729 --> 00:42:21.390]  And we'll play it on the other side.
[00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:22.230]  Thank you for the call, Mike.
[00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:24.510]  Let's go to Eric in Michigan.
[00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:27.011]  Eric, you're on the line.
[00:42:27.031 --> 00:42:27.291]  Yes, sir.
[00:42:27.851 --> 00:42:28.431]  Hey, Jason.
[00:42:28.471 --> 00:42:31.172]  First off, I want to thank you very much for your film, Loose Change.
[00:42:31.472 --> 00:42:33.873]  It completely changed my life, woke me up, and
[00:42:34.659 --> 00:42:37.346]  Proceeded to wake up many of my friends and family members.
[00:42:37.725 --> 00:42:38.285]  Excellent, man.
[00:42:38.325 --> 00:42:38.825]  That's the point.
[00:42:38.845 --> 00:42:44.107]  You know, we're trying to reach out to an audience that wouldn't normally look at this stuff.
[00:42:44.147 --> 00:42:46.328]  And unfortunately, people just don't read anymore.
[00:42:46.548 --> 00:42:51.449]  It's very hard for people to get around this information with just an article or a five-minute YouTube video.
[00:42:51.729 --> 00:42:53.230]  People speak MTV.
[00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:54.710]  People speak movies.
[00:42:54.730 --> 00:43:03.513]  And that's why it is so important to get this information into a palatable format of 90 to 120 minutes, where people can sit down, see the information.
[00:43:03.573 --> 00:43:04.533]  It can change their mind.
[00:43:04.553 --> 00:43:07.414]  And if they want to go back and check everything out, it's sourced.
[00:43:07.634 --> 00:43:09.295]  So you can say, wow, that is a real article.
[00:43:09.315 --> 00:43:11.136]  Oh my God, they really did report that on the news.
[00:43:11.396 --> 00:43:11.796]  Continue.
[00:43:12.776 --> 00:43:15.838]  Well, I wanted to update you guys on the Census Bureau.
[00:43:15.938 --> 00:43:21.140]  I had my confrontation, and I wish I could say they were nice and polite like the other callers did.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:28.443]  But when I confronted him as he was about to walk through my hedge line onto my property, I proceeded to ask who he was.
[00:43:28.543 --> 00:43:33.165]  He told me, and I confronted him with the fact that he was GPS in front doors, and he
[00:43:34.008 --> 00:43:36.410]  Acted like he had no idea that I should know.
[00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:37.971]  He didn't think I should know.
[00:43:38.391 --> 00:43:44.376]  Then he proceeded to tell me, I kindly asked him, you know, I said, I'm going to kindly ask you not to come on my property today, sir.
[00:43:45.156 --> 00:43:52.382]  And he proceeded to get very irate and attack me, told me that he'd call the police and he had every legal right to come on my property.
[00:43:52.522 --> 00:43:55.664]  And I told him, go ahead and call the police.
[00:43:55.684 --> 00:43:59.647]  He continued to threaten me, called me an a-hole and an animal.
[00:44:00.613 --> 00:44:03.897]  And I told him numerous times, call the cops, have them come out.
[00:44:03.937 --> 00:44:05.319]  We'll see what they have to say about it.
[00:44:05.359 --> 00:44:06.020]  He didn't do it.
[00:44:06.801 --> 00:44:10.545]  But he did like to bring up the fact that he asked me if I'd ever served.
[00:44:10.605 --> 00:44:12.507]  And I said, well, you mean the military?
[00:44:12.808 --> 00:44:14.349]  He says, yes, the military.
[00:44:14.369 --> 00:44:15.731]  I told him no, because I haven't.
[00:44:16.604 --> 00:44:17.885]  My family members have.
[00:44:18.326 --> 00:44:19.887]  I've got numerous vets in my family.
[00:44:20.027 --> 00:44:23.569]  As if that makes you less of an American citizen if you didn't serve in the military.
[00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:25.210]  Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[00:44:25.371 --> 00:44:30.034]  Well, I'm sorry that they brainwashed him in the military because obviously he served or he wouldn't have said that to you.
[00:44:30.274 --> 00:44:37.679]  I'm sorry you're brainwashed, sir, and you think it's okay to GPS everybody's house and create a control grid for your globalist masters, but we're not down.
[00:44:37.839 --> 00:44:39.020]  We're about personal freedom.
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.762]  We're supposed to be secure in our persons and property.
[00:44:41.862 --> 00:44:43.023]  I'm sorry if you're
[00:44:43.103 --> 00:44:44.284]  They're animalistic bosses.
[00:44:44.324 --> 00:44:48.586]  They're the a-holes, not us, for saying, hey, wait a minute, don't we have a Fourth Amendment?
[00:44:49.187 --> 00:44:51.188]  Don't we still have the Constitution and Bill of Rights?
[00:44:51.468 --> 00:44:56.071]  Is it really okay for you to just GPS my house and force me to get into this control grid?
[00:44:56.271 --> 00:44:56.911]  Of course it's not.
[00:44:57.131 --> 00:44:59.072]  That's what DHS was set up to do.
[00:44:59.393 --> 00:45:00.613]  Are we starting to realize it?
[00:45:00.733 --> 00:45:06.557]  When they put out, we've exposed three separate DHS documents on top of the MIAC report, and they are going after us.
[00:45:06.737 --> 00:45:09.138]  And then we have this arrest of a person in Louisiana.
[00:45:09.338 --> 00:45:11.480]  By the way, if we can get this guy's name, anybody out there,
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.581]  from Louisiana knows who this is.
[00:45:14.141 --> 00:45:18.363]  This guy got arrested and detained for having a Don't Tread On Me bumper sticker.
[00:45:18.424 --> 00:45:21.885]  Your bumper stickers now say Extremist Terrorist on them.
[00:45:22.186 --> 00:45:24.447]  It is un-ba-lievable.
[00:45:24.547 --> 00:45:25.407]  Thank you for the call.
[00:45:25.808 --> 00:45:27.669]  Let's go to Karen in Oregon.
[00:45:27.689 --> 00:45:28.449]  Karen, you're on the line.
[00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:30.570]  Yes, Karen.
[00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:32.991]  Thank you very much for all that you do.
[00:45:33.031 --> 00:45:35.233]  You helped us wake up as well.
[00:45:35.293 --> 00:45:35.633]  Excellent.
[00:45:36.272 --> 00:45:38.973]  What I'm trying to do is promote an action plan.
[00:45:39.033 --> 00:45:49.016]  It's a peaceful consumer boycott and Congress call-in that started on April 15th and rolls over to the 15th of every month until we the people get the answers that we want.
[00:45:49.856 --> 00:45:58.379]  And it's a way of bringing awareness to people about the income tax issue for one thing, about the illegality of the IRS.
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:03.641]  We encourage people right off the bat to watch America Freedom to Fascism.
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:10.643]  Pretty amazed at all the people who are participating in the teabag movement who have not yet seen that film.
[00:46:10.843 --> 00:46:12.244]  Well, those are the teabaggers.
[00:46:12.304 --> 00:46:13.704]  They're not the tea party people.
[00:46:13.764 --> 00:46:17.966]  Those are the people that just jumped on because Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck told them so.
[00:46:18.006 --> 00:46:20.047]  And they have no idea about the 16th Amendment.
[00:46:20.227 --> 00:46:23.729]  They don't know that the Federal Reserve is private except for what Glenn Beck has told them.
[00:46:24.029 --> 00:46:26.310]  They don't understand that they just print the money out of nowhere.
[00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:31.093]  And the majority of your federal income tax, I think it's something like 30 to 1, just goes to pay off the debt.
[00:46:31.333 --> 00:46:35.877]  All your other, you know, everybody goes, we need taxes for roads, we need taxes for schools.
[00:46:36.077 --> 00:46:37.138]  Those are state taxes.
[00:46:37.178 --> 00:46:38.278]  Those are property taxes.
[00:46:38.298 --> 00:46:39.099]  You pay those anyway.
[00:46:39.299 --> 00:46:41.581]  Has nothing to do with the Federal Reserve System.
[00:46:41.621 --> 00:46:46.104]  And America Freedom to Fascism, again, is the best tool to wake people up to this.
[00:46:46.404 --> 00:46:50.707]  I mean, Aaron Russo, God rest his soul, thank you so much for what you did to this country.
[00:46:50.747 --> 00:46:51.268]  You live on.
[00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:55.531]  And that's why America Freedom to Fascism is named in the MIAC report as an
[00:46:55.891 --> 00:46:57.474]  Evil terrorist document.
[00:46:57.754 --> 00:46:59.297]  Karen, thank you so much for the call.
[00:46:59.317 --> 00:47:00.960]  Let's go to Erica in Ohio.
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:02.061]  Erica, you're on the line.
[00:47:02.963 --> 00:47:04.125]  Hi Jason, how are ya?
[00:47:04.385 --> 00:47:04.706]  I'm good.
[00:47:05.914 --> 00:47:07.775]  I have a couple points I wanted to touch on.
[00:47:07.815 --> 00:47:09.315]  I tried to call in on Friday.
[00:47:09.355 --> 00:47:12.176]  You guys were talking about like the programming and stuff.
[00:47:12.216 --> 00:47:18.438]  You mentioned 30 Rock and how they were correlating with the flu and all that crazy, crazy stuff.
[00:47:18.538 --> 00:47:26.681]  On Law & Order they had one where a woman was on trial because she didn't immunize her daughter and her daughter ended up infecting another parent's child.
[00:47:26.941 --> 00:47:27.201]  Oh no!
[00:47:28.377 --> 00:47:29.318]  I don't think so.
[00:47:44.489 --> 00:47:53.351]  It's gone somewhat mainline with Jenny McCarthy's book Louder Than Words, you know, and her dating Jim Carrey, one of the most mega superstars at the box office, doesn't hurt for our cause.
[00:47:53.551 --> 00:48:07.615]  But then you start seeing Time Magazine covers with a baby taking a shot, telling you, oh, the bad parents who don't vaccinate their kids, they're putting your kids at risk, and now your kids are going to get sick from the evil parents that think vaccines are bad.
[00:48:07.835 --> 00:48:09.535]  They're delicious, just shut up and take them.
[00:48:10.373 --> 00:48:11.295]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:48:23.729 --> 00:48:25.050]  It's just something that I really wanted.
[00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:29.614]  You know, I was glad that you guys brought it up because I had tried to call about it and could never get through.
[00:48:29.754 --> 00:48:30.194]  Well, you know what?
[00:48:30.214 --> 00:48:33.597]  If we don't bring it up, nobody else is going to bring it up, Erica, and I thank you for the call.
[00:48:33.637 --> 00:48:38.000]  And that's why Rupert Murdoch is now saying the Internet, as we know it, will soon be over.
[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:41.362]  It's a story over at PrisonPlanet.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:48:41.603 --> 00:48:51.250]  Billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch gave a strange response when asked about plans for mainstream news websites to charge for content, declaring, the current days of the Internet will soon be
[00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:54.291]  Over, because they're trying to pass the cyber security bill.
[00:48:54.472 --> 00:48:55.332]  Do you understand?
[00:48:55.512 --> 00:48:58.174]  Jay Rockefeller, not your friend.
[00:48:58.554 --> 00:48:59.955]  The Cyber Bullying Act.
[00:49:00.255 --> 00:49:00.655]  Where is that?
[00:49:00.695 --> 00:49:01.475]  That's right in front of me.
[00:49:01.495 --> 00:49:01.755]  Here it is.
[00:49:02.196 --> 00:49:02.436]  H.R.
[00:49:02.976 --> 00:49:02.436]  1966.
[00:49:03.316 --> 00:49:09.500]  Youth who create internet content and use social networking sites are more likely to be targets of cyber bullying.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.741]  We have to save the children, the 2 to 17 year olds.
[00:49:13.062 --> 00:49:19.085]  Meanwhile, they're trying to have the Supreme Court rule that you can send a child to prison for life.
[00:49:19.625 --> 00:49:19.985]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:49:20.005 --> 00:49:21.146]  They can charge them as an adult.
[00:49:21.186 --> 00:49:22.127]  That's what they're trying to do.
[00:49:22.367 --> 00:49:24.308]  And they're saying, oh, the rapists and murderers.
[00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:24.889]  But don't worry.
[00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:26.790]  It won't just be for rapists and murderers.
[00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:31.453]  It'll be people that are classified as extremist terrorists in these DHS documents, too.
[00:49:31.653 --> 00:49:38.137]  And they'll just literally, if they get their way, put children in prison if they show signs of not going along with the system.
[00:49:38.558 --> 00:49:40.219]  Section 2, uh, subsection 3.
[00:49:40.299 --> 00:49:49.245]  Electronic communications provide anonymity to the perpetrator and the potential for widespread public distribution, potentially making them severely dangerous and cruel to the youth.
[00:49:50.185 --> 00:49:51.726]  What are you talking about?
[00:49:52.146 --> 00:49:54.868]  Severely dangerous and cruel to the youth.
[00:49:55.848 --> 00:49:57.289]  What, posting on a message board?
[00:49:57.969 --> 00:49:59.710]  Showing people loose change final cut?
[00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:01.331]  Posting fabled enemies?
[00:50:01.411 --> 00:50:02.612]  Posting the Obama deception?
[00:50:02.652 --> 00:50:03.792]  That's what they're going after.
[00:50:03.812 --> 00:50:03.792]  4.
[00:50:04.412 --> 00:50:10.816]  Online victimizations are associated with emotional distress and other psychological problems, including depression.
[00:50:11.784 --> 00:50:15.426]  We're making people depressed by posting on the internet?
[00:50:16.126 --> 00:50:22.410]  Come on, we are so soft in this society that this bill could even be introduced is gut-wrenching.
[00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:32.275]  Cyberbullying can cause psychological harm including depression, negatively impact academic performance, safety and the well-being of children in school, force children to change schools,
[00:50:33.393 --> 00:50:46.640]  They force children to change schools and then they've got this new commercial of a girl who posted a sexy picture on the internet and someone put it in the hallway at school and everybody's taking the picture and at the end the creepy janitor takes the picture and he's like, oh, look at this.
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.161]  The Cyberbullying Prevention Act.
[00:50:49.221 --> 00:50:50.162]  Give me a break.
[00:50:50.342 --> 00:50:51.242]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:51.262 --> 00:50:52.783]  We've got Alex coming up in about ten minutes.
[00:50:53.123 --> 00:50:56.105]  I'm Jason Burma, sitting in InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:00.868 --> 00:51:12.376]  Today, we cannot afford to ignore the current state of our country, the economy, job layoffs, mass foreclosures, and now we are all at risk of being exposed to this new flu pandemic.
[00:51:12.597 --> 00:51:17.160]  The Center for Disease Control has declared a public health emergency across the United States.
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:18.881]  What can you do to prepare yourself?
[00:51:19.081 --> 00:51:20.883]  The answer is ZeroFlu.com.
[00:51:21.543 --> 00:51:25.125]  ZeroFlu.com offers you the very best at air purifiers.
[00:51:25.325 --> 00:51:38.111]  These revolutionary air purifiers protect up to 3,000 square feet of your home and stop 99.9% of airborne allergens, influenza, bacteria, viruses, pollen, dust, pet dander, black mold, MRSA, and more.
[00:51:38.311 --> 00:51:40.512]  Not only from the air, but from all surfaces.
[00:51:40.712 --> 00:51:41.353]  We're good to go.
[00:52:00.663 --> 00:52:02.005]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:02.185 --> 00:52:07.151]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[00:52:07.552 --> 00:52:09.635]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[00:52:09.975 --> 00:52:19.087]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout group.
[00:52:19.087 --> 00:52:20.007]  We're good to go.
[00:52:43.772 --> 00:52:45.273]  Americans, do you know where your food comes from?
[00:52:45.293 --> 00:52:46.494]  Is it safe, secure, and healthy?
[00:52:46.514 --> 00:52:49.697]  Did you know most of our food is now contaminated with genetically modified ingredients?
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:17.825]  We at Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company have been helping people get pure garden seed for 12 years and carry over 1,200 varieties of GMO-free heirloom seed.
[00:53:18.445 --> 00:53:21.808]  Go to www.rareseeds.com for more information.
[00:53:22.268 --> 00:53:23.589]  That's rareseeds.com.
[00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:28.972]  Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company was started in 1998 by a 17-year-old as a hobby.
[00:53:29.412 --> 00:53:32.374]  It was developed out of a passion for preserving our vegetable heritage.
[00:53:33.034 --> 00:53:39.038]  The company now offers the largest selection of pure heirloom seeds, strive every year to bring back varieties like our forefathers grew.
[00:53:39.793 --> 00:53:43.275]  In times like these, we can't trust the government to keep our seeds safe.
[00:53:43.956 --> 00:53:47.799]  Every year at Baker Creek, we work to preserve the best of the oldest for future gardeners.
[00:53:48.499 --> 00:53:51.741]  We also offer affordable seed collections for long-term storage.
[00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:57.105]  Go to www.rareseeds.com and get your seeds from America's pure seed source.
[00:53:57.586 --> 00:53:59.047]  That's rareseeds.com.
[00:54:13.012 --> 00:54:14.433]  Even more great Metallica!
[00:54:14.653 --> 00:54:18.536]  I love it when they come in with old-school Master of Puppets goodness.
[00:54:19.116 --> 00:54:20.257]  I'll tell you that right now.
[00:54:20.357 --> 00:54:21.458]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:21.498 --> 00:54:22.438]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting in.
[00:54:22.538 --> 00:54:24.139]  Alex coming up at the top of the hour.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.440]  Then we're going to have Bob Chapman.
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:28.382]  Then we're going to have Chris Pinto of the America's Secret Beginning series.
[00:54:28.442 --> 00:54:30.123]  And then finally, Alan Watt.
[00:54:30.464 --> 00:54:31.745]  Jam-packed show today.
[00:54:31.785 --> 00:54:33.146]  We've gone over the Cyberbullying Act.
[00:54:33.346 --> 00:54:35.027]  We've gone over what Rupert Murdoch just said.
[00:54:35.187 --> 00:54:36.948]  We've gone over the Census GPS.
[00:54:37.148 --> 00:54:42.892]  We've gone over the person who was actually arrested for having a Don't Tread on Me bumper sticker.
[00:54:43.272 --> 00:54:44.053]  See, it's happening.
[00:54:44.514 --> 00:54:46.156]  These reports are going on all over.
[00:54:46.556 --> 00:54:49.179]  That MIAC report was just the tip of the spear.
[00:54:49.199 --> 00:54:51.442]  Remember, that's not for public consumption.
[00:54:51.762 --> 00:54:57.328]  Meanwhile, they're still fear-mongering about this swine flu, and no one has died from it in this country.
[00:54:57.348 --> 00:54:57.929]  Let me repeat that.
[00:54:58.389 --> 00:55:00.812]  No one has died from it in this country.
[00:55:00.872 --> 00:55:03.175]  That child was not an American citizen.
[00:55:03.655 --> 00:55:05.296]  And we don't really know if he died of swine flu.
[00:55:05.336 --> 00:55:06.897]  Again, he had all these different problems.
[00:55:07.217 --> 00:55:10.379]  And now this woman, 33, of Texas, didn't die of the swine flu either.
[00:55:10.819 --> 00:55:12.280]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:13.621]  Hit the clip!
[00:55:14.281 --> 00:55:22.266]  A 33-year-old school teacher from a Texas border town has been confirmed as the second death in the United States of a person with swine flu.
[00:55:22.526 --> 00:55:23.227]  But listen closely.
[00:55:23.247 --> 00:55:23.347]  Stop.
[00:55:23.367 --> 00:55:23.827]  Stop right there.
[00:55:23.887 --> 00:55:24.788]  Do you just hear that?
[00:55:24.808 --> 00:55:34.856]  They say this is the second case of someone who's died from the swine flu and ten seconds later they say, well we're gonna just stop short of saying that she actually died from the swine flu.
[00:55:34.896 --> 00:55:35.237]  Hit it.
[00:55:48.382 --> 00:55:50.866]  She did have underlying chronic health conditions.
[00:55:51.887 --> 00:55:52.047]  Oh.
[00:55:52.228 --> 00:55:53.990]  So there are extenuating factors there as well.
[00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:54.771]  Oh, so she was already sick.
[00:55:54.791 --> 00:55:57.696]  Classes at Trunnell's school have been cancelled until Monday.
[00:55:58.136 --> 00:56:03.244]  But officials aren't concerned that students or the woman's co-workers will contract the virus.
[00:56:03.784 --> 00:56:05.465]  There's really nothing to be done at this time.
[00:56:05.525 --> 00:56:07.847]  Again, we're past two incubation periods.
[00:56:08.127 --> 00:56:12.690]  If a person didn't contact the influenza already, then they really don't have anything to worry about.
[00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:16.812]  Meanwhile, Mexicans across the border are slowly returning to normal life.
[00:56:17.213 --> 00:56:24.557]  Stores and restaurants are officially allowed to reopen today, after a five-day nationwide shutdown due to the flu outbreak.
[00:56:24.597 --> 00:56:25.117]  Alright, cut the clip.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.962]  We're going to continue to go to your calls, but there it is.
[00:56:28.002 --> 00:56:29.644]  There's the Orwellian doublespeak.
[00:56:29.824 --> 00:56:31.606]  We got the second death of swine flu.
[00:56:31.646 --> 00:56:34.289]  Oh, by the way, they're saying that she didn't die of swine flu.
[00:56:34.369 --> 00:56:37.031]  Oh, she had all these chronic illnesses beforehand.
[00:56:37.732 --> 00:56:38.573]  Come on!
[00:56:39.497 --> 00:56:42.359]  All right, I want to take this opportunity to thank another great sponsor.
[00:56:42.439 --> 00:56:43.520]  It's eFoodsDirect.
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:49.765]  That's www.eFoodsDirect.com, or the toll-free number is 1-800-409-5633.
[00:56:49.785 --> 00:56:50.425]  That's 1-800-409-5633.
[00:56:51.086 --> 00:56:55.549]  Okay, so we don't have to remind you that you need food to survive.
[00:56:55.609 --> 00:57:00.673]  Our biggest sponsor, eFoodsDirect, is the longest continually operating storable foods company in the country.
[00:57:00.993 --> 00:57:04.816]  They also happen to be true patriots and have supported the Freedom Movement for years and years.
[00:57:05.396 --> 00:57:13.261]  With looming food shortages in current economy, it is imperative that you make sure that your family is prepared with non-GMO, good, clean, storable foods.
[00:57:13.501 --> 00:57:17.844]  Get them at 1-800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com.
[00:57:17.864 --> 00:57:25.169]  Remember, a story that I covered earlier in the week over at the Info Warrior, I do a little radio program, 9 to midnight central time, right from this very seat.
[00:57:25.509 --> 00:57:27.991]  You can see it over at PrisonPlanet.tv, we broadcast live.
[00:57:28.552 --> 00:57:33.520]  They're just automatically going to put GMO seeds in with the regular seeds in Australia, and they're not going to mark them.
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:36.205]  And if you want non-GMO foods, it's going to cost you more.
[00:57:37.366 --> 00:57:38.727]  You know, we pulled that hard article.
[00:57:38.927 --> 00:57:43.009]  I guess it must not exist because I don't have it right here and apparently I'm a big liar.
[00:57:43.249 --> 00:57:44.110]  I just make stuff up.
[00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:50.773]  But I guarantee you type in GMO Australian foods, you hit the news section on Google, you do it in the last week and guess what?
[00:57:50.953 --> 00:57:51.713]  It's gonna pull up.
[00:57:52.194 --> 00:57:54.215]  I'm sorry reality is here.
[00:57:54.655 --> 00:57:57.977]  I'm sorry that the people that you think love you do not.
[00:57:58.357 --> 00:58:00.958]  Alright, let's go to one more caller before Alex comes up next segment.
[00:58:01.278 --> 00:58:02.379]  Uni in New York, you're on the air.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:04.180]  Yes, sir.
[00:58:04.946 --> 00:58:06.267]  Yeah, what's going on, man?
[00:58:06.627 --> 00:58:08.189]  I just had to make a couple of points.
[00:58:08.209 --> 00:58:10.291]  I don't want to take up too much of your time.
[00:58:11.051 --> 00:58:25.163]  First off, I live in New York, and I don't know if I was just paranoid, but I was wondering, because you know how they have, usually, I don't know about where your state is, but on the 15th of April every year,
[00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:30.051]  It's usually the cut-off time where you have to, you know, like, have, like... Have your taxes.
[00:58:30.071 --> 00:58:30.791]  Listen, hold over.
[00:58:30.851 --> 00:58:33.532]  If Alex isn't there, I'll go back to you, or we'll go back to you after Alex.
[00:58:33.852 --> 00:58:34.792]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:34.852 --> 00:58:35.833]  I'm Jason Burmas, sitting in.
[00:58:35.873 --> 00:58:36.933]  We'll be back after this.
[00:58:37.213 --> 00:58:39.314]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:42.374 --> 00:58:46.075]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.848 --> 00:58:52.429]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.529 --> 00:58:57.170]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.270 --> 00:59:00.011]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.232 --> 00:59:03.093]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.273 --> 00:59:09.135]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.355 --> 00:59:12.319]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:19.510]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:19.610 --> 00:59:22.734]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:59:22.894 --> 00:59:23.135]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:25.558 --> 00:59:27.799]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:59:28.019 --> 00:59:34.102]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:59:34.282 --> 00:59:41.425]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:41.445 --> 00:59:45.427]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:59:45.627 --> 00:59:46.587]  Take action today.
[00:59:46.767 --> 00:59:48.548]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:53.661 --> 00:59:55.583]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.043 --> 00:59:58.925]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:06.091]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.751 --> 01:00:07.832]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.533 --> 01:00:09.674]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.294 --> 01:00:11.135]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.155 --> 01:00:12.856]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.437 --> 01:00:17.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.962]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:21.709]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:23.750]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:25.191]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:25.291 --> 01:00:27.331]  Alex is supposed to be calling in in the near future.
[01:00:27.351 --> 01:00:32.833]  We've got Bob Chapman coming up in just a few moments, but I want to go through the rest of these phone calls that I've got on the line.
[01:00:33.013 --> 01:00:34.514]  We're going to go back to Uni in New York.
[01:00:34.534 --> 01:00:37.415]  You were discussing April 15th and Tax Day in New York.
[01:00:37.535 --> 01:00:37.875]  Go ahead.
[01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:41.816]  Well, it's not even just a tax day in New York.
[01:00:42.216 --> 01:00:46.518]  You have to keep your heating, your oil on, you know, until the 15th.
[01:00:47.754 --> 01:00:51.697]  And then I noticed this year that they had moved it to May 15th, another month.
[01:00:51.757 --> 01:01:00.342]  I was wondering if that had anything to do with weather modification because it's been excessively cold here for it to be almost June, pushing June.
[01:01:00.362 --> 01:01:01.963]  I was just wondering if that had anything to do with it.
[01:01:01.983 --> 01:01:03.284]  You know, I was just in New York.
[01:01:03.344 --> 01:01:06.046]  I wasn't in the city, but I was just there like a week and a half ago.
[01:01:06.086 --> 01:01:08.988]  I was there on the weekend of the 25th and 26th of April.
[01:01:09.008 --> 01:01:09.908]  It was gorgeous out, man.
[01:01:09.968 --> 01:01:10.789]  It was like 85 degrees.
[01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:11.810]  I was out playing baseball.
[01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:16.973]  Yeah, we had two back-to-back days, but I'm just saying like normally it's a lot warmer by now.
[01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:22.397]  Look, all I know is that they're openly putting out documents that they're going to be doing geoengineering.
[01:01:22.617 --> 01:01:28.702]  They're openly saying that they might block the sun's rays with pollutants in the upper atmosphere.
[01:01:28.822 --> 01:01:31.664]  Meanwhile, we can actually see the chemtrails, but they don't exist.
[01:01:31.704 --> 01:01:34.907]  It doesn't matter if the CFR has talked about it for years, put it on paper.
[01:01:34.927 --> 01:01:37.789]  It doesn't matter now if the new climate chief is talking about it.
[01:01:37.809 --> 01:01:40.911]  It doesn't matter if the Barack Obama administration is openly saying it.
[01:01:40.951 --> 01:01:41.972]  Look, it exists.
[01:01:42.252 --> 01:01:43.993]  They're incrementally telling you about it.
[01:01:44.274 --> 01:01:45.835]  I think that they're just making you keep it on to
[01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:46.215]  Yes sir.
[01:01:46.295 --> 01:01:47.396]  Have you guys heard about HR 2159 yet?
[01:01:47.416 --> 01:01:47.856]  Which one is that?
[01:01:47.896 --> 01:01:49.777]  That would be the one that they just introduced last week.
[01:02:10.137 --> 01:02:15.803]  He gives the Attorney General the power to deny firearms to anyone who's suspected of or potentially a terrorist?
[01:02:16.043 --> 01:02:17.285]  Yes, no, we have covered it.
[01:02:17.365 --> 01:02:31.801]  Alex covered it earlier in the week and it is like a total gun ban bill and they can just go after anybody and since the DHS is classifying everybody as a terrorist and an extremist in this latest lexicon document and the mainstream media just laughs about it, Washington Times goes,
[01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:35.752]  The really bad part is you cannot appeal the decision.
[01:02:54.281 --> 01:02:55.922]  Yeah, it's a total police state takeover.
[01:02:56.182 --> 01:03:05.970]  Listen, even if they pass that resolution, it's against the Constitution and Bill of Rights, and if there was ever a time for the Second Amendment, it is that time.
[01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:07.211]  Give out the bill number again.
[01:03:07.231 --> 01:03:08.652]  HR 2159.
[01:03:09.012 --> 01:03:11.454]  And when are they going to be voting on this, do you know?
[01:03:12.717 --> 01:03:15.758]  I don't know, it was just introduced on the 29th of last month, or 27th.
[01:03:15.858 --> 01:03:18.920]  Okay, we will be following that bill closely.
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:23.642]  I'm sure people will send it to my MySpace, myspace.com slash Jason Burmas, or you can check me out at Facebook.
[01:03:23.942 --> 01:03:29.624]  I do go through that every single morning and every single afternoon for tips for this radio show and my radio show.
[01:03:29.885 --> 01:03:31.565]  Let's jump to Mike in Alabama.
[01:03:31.605 --> 01:03:32.306]  Mike, you're on the line.
[01:03:33.606 --> 01:03:33.926]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:35.847 --> 01:03:36.207]  We got him?
[01:03:37.228 --> 01:03:37.468]  Hello?
[01:03:37.808 --> 01:03:37.988]  Yes.
[01:03:38.668 --> 01:03:39.089]  Are you there?
[01:03:39.469 --> 01:03:39.649]  Yes.
[01:03:41.727 --> 01:03:43.831]  Okay, I've got a couple points I want to bring up.
[01:03:44.392 --> 01:03:45.313]  One on chemtrails.
[01:03:46.495 --> 01:03:50.602]  I live in Satsuma, Alabama, and I have actually documented with video.
[01:03:51.804 --> 01:03:54.709]  I've got over an hour or so worth of different days.
[01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:58.471]  This has been happening and it's plane, you can see it.
[01:03:59.052 --> 01:03:59.692]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:03:59.712 --> 01:04:03.296]  Listen, I think to myself, they try to say that this is planes going to land.
[01:04:03.336 --> 01:04:10.883]  No, it's usually a team of two to four jets doing criss-cross patterns all throughout the sky and it has nothing to do with their fuel.
[01:04:11.143 --> 01:04:14.526]  No, they are plastering the sky with chemtrails.
[01:04:14.586 --> 01:04:15.207]  They exist.
[01:04:15.307 --> 01:04:16.828]  I don't care what MythBusters says.
[01:04:16.888 --> 01:04:17.169]  Go ahead.
[01:04:17.708 --> 01:04:19.089]  Exactly, you're exactly right.
[01:04:19.229 --> 01:04:22.752]  I've got it on video, and you're welcome to get a copy of it.
[01:04:22.832 --> 01:04:26.455]  What we'll do is we will give out the PO Box at the top of the next segment.
[01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:27.916]  If you want to send it, that's where to do it.
[01:04:27.976 --> 01:04:28.937]  I thank you for the call, sir.
[01:04:28.977 --> 01:04:29.578]  I've got to jump.
[01:04:29.618 --> 01:04:31.519]  I've only got 30 seconds in this segment left.
[01:04:31.699 --> 01:04:35.142]  We've got Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com coming up.
[01:04:35.182 --> 01:04:36.724]  We're waiting on Alex Jones' phone call.
[01:04:37.324 --> 01:04:40.367]  But again, you know, he's out there with the family, taking a much-deserved break.
[01:04:41.067 --> 01:04:48.156]  It's great that we can take a little bit of time to be human beings and get away from all this madness, but the madness isn't going to stop if we stop addressing it.
[01:04:49.057 --> 01:04:50.038]  We have to fight this.
[01:04:50.539 --> 01:04:51.680]  You want a free humanity?
[01:04:51.901 --> 01:04:52.702]  You gotta work for it.
[01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:53.923]  It doesn't come for free, folks.
[01:04:54.504 --> 01:04:55.345]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:55.365 --> 01:04:56.346]  We'll be back after this.
[01:04:56.406 --> 01:04:57.347]  Infowars.com.
[01:04:57.387 --> 01:04:58.048]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:01.201 --> 01:05:02.622]  So you want to stop smoking.
[01:05:02.662 --> 01:05:03.783]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[01:05:03.943 --> 01:05:06.705]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[01:05:06.825 --> 01:05:10.648]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[01:05:10.808 --> 01:05:14.351]  And if, and only if, you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it.
[01:05:14.591 --> 01:05:16.533]  Most likely, if you try this, you'd be arrested.
[01:05:16.593 --> 01:05:20.536]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the Smokefree free trial offer is.
[01:05:20.916 --> 01:05:23.698]  Smokefree is a complete all-natural stop smoking system.
[01:05:23.818 --> 01:05:27.561]  And when you call today, they'll send you a 30-day supply of the program absolutely free.
[01:05:27.961 --> 01:05:28.662]  We're good to go.
[01:05:44.164 --> 01:05:47.127]  Join the tens of thousands who have quit for life with Smokefree.
[01:05:47.327 --> 01:05:47.847]  Call 1-800-426-6186 today.
[01:05:47.867 --> 01:05:48.108]  That's 1-800-426-6186.
[01:05:48.128 --> 01:05:50.350]  This is a limited time offer, so call 1-800-426-6186 now.
[01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:54.253]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:07.504 --> 01:06:12.868]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:06:13.368 --> 01:06:19.593]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:19.913 --> 01:06:21.714]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:21.874 --> 01:06:24.276]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:06:24.316 --> 01:06:35.204]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:06:37.506 --> 01:06:38.788]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:39.168 --> 01:06:40.549]  It's about a one world government.
[01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:47.397]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:06:47.937 --> 01:06:55.725]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:56.206 --> 01:06:57.367]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:57.787 --> 01:06:58.969]  The people strike back.
[01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:02.551]  You are a rebel.
[01:07:02.871 --> 01:07:03.271]  Admit it.
[01:07:03.611 --> 01:07:06.393]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[01:07:06.573 --> 01:07:08.654]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[01:07:08.975 --> 01:07:12.677]  Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[01:07:12.917 --> 01:07:14.598]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot.
[01:07:14.958 --> 01:07:17.180]  And you can count your real friends on one hand.
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.241]  Well, join the club.
[01:07:18.421 --> 01:07:24.364]  Einstein failed math, quit school, and his rebel ideas led to some of the world's most amazing discoveries.
[01:07:24.625 --> 01:07:28.447]  Edison rebelled against the dark, failed over a thousand times, then invented
[01:07:30.939 --> 01:07:37.101]  Alex Jones is working to save that very country.
[01:07:37.261 --> 01:07:38.642]  So go ahead, be a rebel.
[01:07:38.802 --> 01:07:41.423]  Put in a food supply from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:41.623 --> 01:07:44.564]  Everyone will realize you were not a nutcase after all.
[01:07:44.744 --> 01:07:46.125]  efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:46.405 --> 01:07:50.986]  If you're going to pick something to stand for, be sure you have enough food to keep on standing.
[01:07:51.006 --> 01:07:51.927]  800-409-5633. efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:51.967 --> 01:07:52.287]  That's 800-409-5633.
[01:08:01.374 --> 01:08:03.758]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.299 --> 01:08:07.183]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.528 --> 01:08:11.750]  Alright folks, we are back.
[01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:12.831]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:12.932 --> 01:08:13.893]  I'm Jason Burma, sitting in.
[01:08:14.918 --> 01:08:19.781]  And we are now joined by Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:08:19.841 --> 01:08:29.547]  And right off the bat, I really want to get his take on the quote-unquote stress test, and the government now saying, oh, we're just going to give even more money to the banks, Bank of America in particular.
[01:08:29.567 --> 01:08:37.452]  They're saying another $30-plus billion, which, you know, if they're able to loan it out, will be much more than $30 billion, as you know if you listen to this program.
[01:08:37.472 --> 01:08:38.212]  How are you today, Bob?
[01:08:39.553 --> 01:08:40.333]  Just terrific.
[01:08:40.393 --> 01:08:41.114]  Just terrific.
[01:08:42.175 --> 01:08:44.116]  All right, so let's get your take on this.
[01:08:45.699 --> 01:09:01.910]  First of all, many of these banks and financial firms such as Brokerage Houses and Wall Street, AIG, other insurance companies, they are carrying CDOs and ABSs off balance sheet.
[01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:03.591]  And they're still doing it.
[01:09:04.491 --> 01:09:07.433]  Now, CDOs are collateralized debt obligations.
[01:09:08.054 --> 01:09:10.755]  They are bonds which consist of mortgages.
[01:09:12.316 --> 01:09:14.538]  The others, the ABS, are
[01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:37.326]  asset-backed securities and they have inside of those bonds credit card debt, people who created debt paper by buying motorcycles, mobile homes, automobiles, swimming pools, etc.
[01:09:37.366 --> 01:09:40.408]  That kind of paper, so to speak.
[01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:43.711]  And what they've done, because
[01:09:44.585 --> 01:09:47.567]  This paper is, generally speaking, unsaleable.
[01:09:49.268 --> 01:09:54.732]  They've kept it off the balance sheet and they put it into another corporation.
[01:09:55.853 --> 01:09:56.974]  But it still belongs to them.
[01:09:58.054 --> 01:10:13.105]  And at the same time, what has happened is the FASB, which is an international accounting organization, which had corporations begin to report
[01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:22.934]  Uh, their balance sheets on a regular basis and marking their investments to the market.
[01:10:24.755 --> 01:10:29.617]  Now they changed it from that to marking them to model the difference.
[01:10:30.998 --> 01:10:43.384]  Let's say the Bank of America owns a million dollars worth of IBM bonds and they see the bonds trading each day and they have to put down on their balance sheet that
[01:10:44.278 --> 01:10:54.545]  IBM is trading at par, which is $1,000, and we bought it at par, so we didn't lose anything, we didn't gain anything, we still have it on the books at $1,000 a bond.
[01:10:56.226 --> 01:10:58.007]  Now, mark-to-model is different.
[01:10:59.028 --> 01:11:12.997]  This is for securities that don't have a ready market, that they might try to trade every six months, or three months, or maybe once a month, and they're usually made up of these CDOs and ABSs.
[01:11:14.542 --> 01:11:37.973]  Well, as we all know now, that these instruments that were sold at par, which is $1,000 each, they were called AAA, when in fact, BBB is the difference between 10 and 3 or 4, that they're selling for, when they do, anywhere between 10 cents and 50 cents in the dollar.
[01:11:38.473 --> 01:11:42.095]  And these entities, like these banks, are carrying on the books
[01:11:42.737 --> 01:11:44.618]  Mark the model, whatever they feel like it.
[01:11:46.098 --> 01:11:48.339]  Whatever they say it's worth, that's what it is.
[01:11:48.379 --> 01:11:50.720]  And the government says, just make it reasonable.
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:56.823]  So instead of putting them in a par, which is ridiculous, they might put them in an 85 or 80 cents or 75.
[01:11:57.343 --> 01:12:05.286]  So they're carrying a whole bunch of investments that are not worth what they say they are.
[01:12:05.866 --> 01:12:10.568]  So the situation with these banks and many others, pension funds, mutual funds,
[01:12:12.147 --> 01:12:21.192]  Brokerage firms, they're carrying paper like that, paper being bonds, and everything that they're telling you is bogus.
[01:12:21.812 --> 01:12:25.114]  So what's the impact going to be on the average American citizen?
[01:12:26.835 --> 01:12:35.360]  What's going to happen eventually is the inflationary aspects being created by the Fed
[01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:44.615]  We'll be offset eventually by the deflationary aspects that they're trying to drown out and have been for five and a half years.
[01:12:46.276 --> 01:12:57.242]  So the next step will be a switch from inflation or hyperinflation, probably two to three years down the road, to deflation and a total collapse.
[01:12:58.243 --> 01:13:00.144]  And they know this does not work.
[01:13:01.065 --> 01:13:05.968]  It could work on a small scale, but not with the debt that they have today.
[01:13:07.045 --> 01:13:13.586]  Now, as that happens, do you see them using these SDR units to take over as the world reserve currency?
[01:13:13.606 --> 01:13:16.287]  It kind of looks like it's headed that way right now.
[01:13:16.327 --> 01:13:18.547]  The dollar will be dropped as the world reserve currency.
[01:13:18.587 --> 01:13:22.908]  They brought in these SDRs, special drawing rights units, after the G20.
[01:13:23.688 --> 01:13:30.189]  Mexico recently took $47 billion in SDRs due to the quote-unquote swine flu.
[01:13:30.549 --> 01:13:33.389]  I mean, what's the progression of this new global currency?
[01:13:34.730 --> 01:13:36.350]  All it is is a bookkeeping entry.
[01:13:37.924 --> 01:13:40.907]  It's another bigger Federal Reserve.
[01:13:42.488 --> 01:13:43.989]  They're creating it out of thin air.
[01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:49.654]  And they've been around since 1968-69, and they've been a disaster.
[01:13:49.674 --> 01:13:50.635]  I mean, they've never worked.
[01:13:51.515 --> 01:13:54.018]  It's just another method of putting it off.
[01:13:55.179 --> 01:14:06.308]  And so nobody has to come up with any money to give money to the government in Mexico, because they just debit their book, credit their book,
[01:14:07.822 --> 01:14:08.303]  I don't know.
[01:14:28.525 --> 01:14:30.226]  So then what will happen to the IMF?
[01:14:30.246 --> 01:14:32.127]  Because they don't listen to this program.
[01:14:32.608 --> 01:14:37.490]  So then what will happen to the IMF and the Federal Reserve and the World Bank after something like that occurs?
[01:14:38.551 --> 01:14:39.391]  They all go broke.
[01:14:40.372 --> 01:14:40.792]  And what do you think?
[01:14:40.812 --> 01:14:42.553]  They just create a new entity out of the three?
[01:14:43.814 --> 01:14:45.495]  Well, that's what I think they'd like to do.
[01:14:45.955 --> 01:14:51.378]  But if we stay on the radio, we're going to stop them from doing it because people all over the world are listening to this.
[01:14:52.019 --> 01:14:55.601]  And now they know the game that these guys are up to.
[01:14:56.401 --> 01:14:57.502]  And they're not going to let them do it.
[01:14:58.157 --> 01:14:59.458]  They don't want a world currency.
[01:14:59.478 --> 01:15:01.359]  I get lots of letters from people all over the world.
[01:15:01.719 --> 01:15:05.001]  We're not going to let it happen in our country, and thanks for telling us.
[01:15:05.381 --> 01:15:16.527]  And we know the guys who are working with the guys in New York and London and Washington doing this, and we're not going to let them shove some international monetary unit down our throats.
[01:15:17.448 --> 01:15:19.549]  Why don't you tell people how they can get your newsletter, Bob?
[01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:22.050]  Well, there's two ways.
[01:15:22.090 --> 01:15:25.452]  You can go to TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:15:27.714 --> 01:15:36.399]  International F-O-R-E-C-A-S-T-E-R dot com or you can call toll free 877-479-8178.
[01:15:36.419 --> 01:15:37.800]  That's 877-479-8178.
[01:15:49.465 --> 01:16:05.025]  I want to shift gears now to this latest DHS document that we've been reporting on since last week, the domestic extremism lexicon, that in the first paragraph of the first page it says, you know, this is for non-Islamic extremism that poses a threat
[01:16:05.265 --> 01:16:05.585]  We're good to go.
[01:16:28.539 --> 01:16:33.202]  Now, it doesn't say we're going to cause terror, it doesn't say that we're causing violence, but we're the extremists.
[01:16:33.622 --> 01:16:34.522]  We're the terrorists.
[01:16:34.803 --> 01:16:35.923]  Speak on that for a moment.
[01:16:38.124 --> 01:16:39.445]  It's been a long time coming.
[01:16:40.966 --> 01:16:42.347]  It's to be fully expected.
[01:16:43.948 --> 01:16:49.091]  The adversaries that we have probably have the power to do that.
[01:16:50.591 --> 01:16:51.992]  They want to take us off the air.
[01:16:52.072 --> 01:16:54.954]  We're reaching millions of people.
[01:16:55.769 --> 01:16:56.269]  Every day.
[01:16:56.309 --> 01:16:58.431]  I mean, what is Alex on nine hours a day?
[01:16:58.451 --> 01:17:10.279]  I probably do, uh, maybe six or seven, eight hours of programming a day and we're killing them because the world is finding out who the bad guys are.
[01:17:11.039 --> 01:17:16.603]  And so you can expect that they will try to use that.
[01:17:16.623 --> 01:17:19.265]  And I think probably they'll nibble at the edges first.
[01:17:19.945 --> 01:17:23.067]  And they probably come after people like me who don't have an actual show.
[01:17:23.828 --> 01:17:24.268]  And, um,
[01:17:25.074 --> 01:17:26.635]  And try to shut me up.
[01:17:27.716 --> 01:17:32.580]  And if they can't do that, well, I'll call a station and say we don't want this guy on anymore.
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:33.921]  And then the fight begins.
[01:17:34.912 --> 01:17:40.015]  You know, and now we're seeing real parts of the MIAC report coming home to roost.
[01:17:40.035 --> 01:17:46.959]  You know, we had a couple calls here and there saying I was pulled over for a Ron Paul bumper sticker, but nothing that was reported in mainline media.
[01:17:47.279 --> 01:18:03.169]  And now we have a story over at InfoWars and Prison Planet that a Louisiana driver was stopped and detained for having a Don't Tread On Me bumper sticker on his vehicle and warned by a police officer about the subversive message it sent, according to the driver's relative.
[01:18:03.689 --> 01:18:12.071]  I mean, this is absolutely ridiculous that you can't have a bumper sticker on your car without law enforcement illegally detaining you.
[01:18:13.891 --> 01:18:32.815]  Well, they can do what they want as long as they can do it, but that sort of approach and an approach of shutting Alex and you and all the people like us off the air is going to force the American people in the midst of a depression, and that's what we're in.
[01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:35.131]  I don't think so.
[01:18:49.753 --> 01:18:55.037]  Absolutely, and I think that's really why they're going after the internet right now, so openly, so publicly.
[01:18:55.117 --> 01:19:01.042]  Not only do we have the Cyber Security Act that has been introduced by Jay Rockefeller, but we've got this one, H.R.
[01:19:01.783 --> 01:19:04.985]  1966, which is the Cyber Bullying Prevention Act.
[01:19:05.305 --> 01:19:09.629]  Let me just read you a subsection of this, Section 2, Findings, Subsection 6.
[01:19:10.429 --> 01:19:10.850]  Yes, we are.
[01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.532]  With problematic internet experiences.
[01:19:30.712 --> 01:19:31.953]  People have problems, Bob.
[01:19:32.194 --> 01:19:34.436]  You know, people get depressed on their own.
[01:19:34.456 --> 01:19:36.378]  I don't see what the internet has anything to do with it.
[01:19:36.578 --> 01:19:40.021]  And they're saying 54% of these clients were under the age of 18.
[01:19:40.582 --> 01:19:41.943]  We have to save the children.
[01:19:42.183 --> 01:19:46.367]  I want to get his take on HR 1966 when we come back.
[01:19:46.607 --> 01:19:47.728]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:48.069 --> 01:19:48.909]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[01:19:49.049 --> 01:19:49.930]  We'll be back after this.
[01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:51.051]  Infowars.com.
[01:19:51.292 --> 01:19:51.892]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:20:01.061 --> 01:20:06.567]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[01:20:07.047 --> 01:20:07.748]  Think about that.
[01:20:07.808 --> 01:20:10.450]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[01:20:10.931 --> 01:20:13.874]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[01:20:14.134 --> 01:20:23.944]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious tasting, chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants.
[01:20:24.384 --> 01:20:29.949]  Unlike hard-to-digest pills, Choose for Health is a convenient chewable which allows for better digestion.
[01:20:30.209 --> 01:20:31.250]  The choice is yours.
[01:20:31.390 --> 01:20:36.674]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can better digest.
[01:20:36.995 --> 01:20:37.735]  Choose for Health.
[01:20:38.015 --> 01:20:41.819]  The world's first superfruit, sea vegetable, antioxidant chewable.
[01:20:42.079 --> 01:20:44.521]  Whole food nutrition, not rocks and shells.
[01:20:44.881 --> 01:20:45.601]  1-800-210-1922.

[01:21:02.729 --> 01:21:03.789]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:04.190 --> 01:21:09.672]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:21:10.232 --> 01:21:10.752]  That's right.
[01:21:11.053 --> 01:21:13.334]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:21:14.744 --> 01:21:20.869]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:29.076]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:29.517 --> 01:21:34.381]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:21:35.001 --> 01:21:38.044]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:40.799 --> 01:21:44.923]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:21:45.323 --> 01:21:45.603]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:45.623 --> 01:21:47.064]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:21:47.084 --> 01:21:47.285]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:47.305 --> 01:21:47.505]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:47.525 --> 01:21:49.507]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.542]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.043 --> 01:22:14.010]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:22:14.631 --> 01:22:20.798]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:21.218 --> 01:22:23.040]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:25.602]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:22:25.682 --> 01:22:36.651]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:37.271 --> 01:22:38.552]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:38.932 --> 01:22:40.314]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:40.794 --> 01:22:47.039]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:22:55.952 --> 01:22:57.113]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:57.533 --> 01:22:58.794]  The people strike back.
[01:23:00.796 --> 01:23:03.178]  Are you concerned for the safety of your loved ones?
[01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:06.681]  Listen closely to this message from Pepperspray.com.

[01:23:10.264 --> 01:23:14.388]  America has changed and your personal safety is your first priority.
[01:23:14.688 --> 01:23:15.308]  Be smart.
[01:23:15.508 --> 01:23:16.089]  Be safe.
[01:23:16.429 --> 01:23:18.791]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[01:24:23.427 --> 01:24:29.255]  And let this train keep on riding, riding on through
[01:24:39.548 --> 01:24:42.249]  Folks, where is the love on this cyberbullying act?
[01:24:42.909 --> 01:24:47.551]  And let me define what cyberbullying is, and then we're going to go to Bob Chapman and get his take on it.
[01:24:47.591 --> 01:24:49.972]  Section 881, Cyberbullying.
[01:24:50.172 --> 01:25:08.220]  Section A. Whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication with the intent to coerce, intimidate, harass, or cause substantial emotional distress to a person using electronic means to support severe, repeated, and hostile behavior shall be fined under this title or imprisoned
[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:12.784]  Well, I think it's tragic that people's feelings have been and will continue to be hurt, but it certainly
[01:25:29.461 --> 01:25:31.963]  Uh, by being thrown in jail makes it a felony.
[01:25:32.904 --> 01:25:40.489]  And, uh, I don't think that's an appropriate, uh, sentence for someone who says something that somebody else doesn't like.
[01:25:40.829 --> 01:25:41.930]  Well, isn't that the First Amendment?
[01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.951]  Aren't we supposed to be able to dissent, Bob?
[01:25:43.991 --> 01:25:52.177]  I mean, that's the whole point of this country, that unpopular ideas can be expressed without the threat of jail or fines.
[01:25:52.237 --> 01:25:57.561]  I mean, that's what the First Amendment is about, and now they're trying to take that away on the Internet as they try to further regulate it.
[01:25:59.130 --> 01:26:00.531]  Well, that's absolutely correct.
[01:26:01.312 --> 01:26:03.253]  And they're going to be relentless.
[01:26:03.293 --> 01:26:04.254]  They're not going to stop.
[01:26:05.135 --> 01:26:19.865]  They'll be there with their bushel baskets of $100 bills, giving it out to the people in Congress, along with their lobbying people and their campaign contributions and the jobs here and there.
[01:26:19.946 --> 01:26:25.550]  And after you leave your office, you'll be the president of XYZ Foundation.
[01:26:26.371 --> 01:26:31.075]  And your wife and children will be taken care of, and they're going to do it.
[01:26:31.275 --> 01:26:35.999]  They're going to keep on pressing until they eventually shut us down.
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:50.372]  And so what we have to do, number one, is inform the public of what they're trying to do, get after Congress to see if it'll do any good, and prepare people that there's going to come a day, perhaps, where we're not going to be on the air.
[01:26:51.823 --> 01:26:53.724]  Yeah, I mean, and that's what this is about.
[01:26:53.764 --> 01:26:56.066]  I mean, again, they shut down the Alex Jones Channel.
[01:26:56.926 --> 01:26:59.508]  18 months up, 30 million views combined.
[01:26:59.808 --> 01:27:03.111]  I mean, you look at the Obama deception, it's almost at 2 million views.
[01:27:03.691 --> 01:27:04.812]  One copy alone.
[01:27:05.052 --> 01:27:11.676]  People call into this show every day talking about the hundreds and thousands of Obama deceptions that they've copied and given to other people.
[01:27:11.756 --> 01:27:12.377]  I'm getting calls
[01:27:12.877 --> 01:27:18.141]  Every night on my radio show, hey Jason, I just woke up last month, someone gave me a copy of the Obama Deception.
[01:27:18.401 --> 01:27:24.965]  Hey Jason, I just woke up two weeks ago, I got turned on to your show after I typed the Obama Deception into YouTube, and I came across the Info Warrior.
[01:27:25.265 --> 01:27:32.270]  They don't like that we're having an impact, and now that there is a Democratic administration in that we're waking up the right wing.
[01:27:34.751 --> 01:27:35.152]  And we are.
[01:27:35.836 --> 01:27:37.197]  Yeah, I mean, it's incredible to me.
[01:27:37.217 --> 01:27:45.764]  Well, waking up everybody, you know, everybody cares about their life, cares about their family, cares about the country in which they live.
[01:27:45.784 --> 01:27:47.045]  That's just not America.
[01:27:47.565 --> 01:27:54.891]  I mean, there are people listening to these broadcasts all over the world, and they don't want to lose what they have.
[01:27:55.171 --> 01:27:57.693]  They don't want to become slaves of the Illuminati.
[01:27:58.194 --> 01:27:59.795]  They don't want to be told what to do.
[01:28:00.335 --> 01:28:03.438]  They don't want to be told they can't plant things on their farms.
[01:28:04.481 --> 01:28:06.362]  They can't fish for certain fish.
[01:28:07.603 --> 01:28:09.764]  They can't be a carpenter or whatever.
[01:28:10.965 --> 01:28:14.186]  And that's what the New World Order wants.
[01:28:14.867 --> 01:28:16.768]  And we're getting that word out to them.
[01:28:17.428 --> 01:28:32.596]  You know, Jason, in just the last year, this whole information program that we have has exploded throughout the world.
[01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:41.170]  People's minds were open because they knew something wasn't wrong and Alex and you and others like you have filled that void.
[01:28:42.301 --> 01:28:48.283]  Well, you know, we're going to continue to do so, no matter what they rule on, whether they pass these ludicrous bills or not.
[01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:56.045]  I mean, we had that malicious attack last week after we exposed, you know, Baxter and the vaccinations, and the swine flu really is a hoax.
[01:28:56.425 --> 01:29:03.568]  I'm not going to say who we got a cease and desist letter from, but let's just say our biggest internet attack ever came directly after that.
[01:29:03.588 --> 01:29:04.628]  And we're not hyping it, folks.
[01:29:04.688 --> 01:29:06.548]  I came in here, I couldn't get on InfoWars.
[01:29:06.789 --> 01:29:11.410]  It got up just before my show, but then in the middle of my show, totally and completely gone.
[01:29:11.690 --> 01:29:24.693]  On the other side, Bob, I really want to talk about how we can protect ourselves financially by getting into gold and silver, you know, a currency that has lasted thousands of years and really does have the closest thing to intrinsic value.
[01:29:24.773 --> 01:29:26.633]  This isn't a fiat currency.
[01:29:26.993 --> 01:29:27.934]  We'll be back after this.
[01:29:28.214 --> 01:29:29.254]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:29.274 --> 01:29:38.096]  We've got Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com are where you're going to find the latest news articles right now.
[01:29:51.451 --> 01:29:54.432]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.452 --> 01:29:58.153]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.434 --> 01:30:04.715]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:30:04.875 --> 01:30:08.976]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:30:09.136 --> 01:30:17.098]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water,
[01:30:17.378 --> 01:30:17.798]  We're good to go!
[01:30:47.193 --> 01:30:52.177]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:30:52.358 --> 01:30:56.521]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:31:13.749 --> 01:31:19.932]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:20.252 --> 01:31:22.053]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:22.193 --> 01:31:24.594]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:31:24.674 --> 01:31:35.619]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:39.100]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:40.901]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:31:41.391 --> 01:31:47.733]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:31:48.293 --> 01:31:56.075]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com, or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:56.555 --> 01:31:57.695]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:58.136 --> 01:31:59.316]  The people strike back.
[01:32:01.033 --> 01:32:06.077]  As the economy continues to plummet, many of us will have to make difficult choices and cut back on our expenses.
[01:32:06.618 --> 01:32:09.160]  One thing we cannot afford to cut back on, though, is our health.
[01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:16.245]  If you suffer from chronic illness, stress, weak immune health, or just feel tired, you need to visit Shentrition.com.
[01:32:16.686 --> 01:32:20.429]  Shentrition is an innovative supplement that stimulates the healing power of the body.

[01:32:53.608 --> 01:32:54.709]  Come, you masters of war.
[01:32:54.729 --> 01:32:55.669]  It'll build the big guns.
[01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:57.070]  It'll build the death planes.
[01:32:57.190 --> 01:32:58.211]  It'll build all the bombs.
[01:33:21.618 --> 01:33:47.860]  You that hide behind walls You that hide behind desks I just want you to know I can see through your masks You that never done nothing But build to destroy You play with my world
[01:33:49.611 --> 01:33:49.931]  We are back.
[01:33:49.951 --> 01:33:54.096]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:54.196 --> 01:33:58.461]  I'm Jason Burma, sitting in.
[01:34:12.065 --> 01:34:16.706]  We've got Bob Chapman with us, and we're going to bring Ted Anderson up in about 10 minutes.
[01:34:17.787 --> 01:34:25.669]  But Bob, why don't you tell people how important it is to get into gold and silver in order to really, you know, save your wealth.
[01:34:25.889 --> 01:34:28.089]  Try to have something after this economic collapse.
[01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:29.130]  Really hedge your bets.
[01:34:31.170 --> 01:34:32.911]  Well, let's go to the conclusion.
[01:34:34.091 --> 01:34:36.412]  The conclusion is, where else can you go?
[01:34:37.672 --> 01:34:41.253]  Historically, when you've had a depression like we're in,
[01:34:42.037 --> 01:34:54.301]  In this stage, it's an inflationary one and probably will go into hyperinflation and then that'll be followed by a deflationary depression, which is dreadful.
[01:34:55.401 --> 01:35:05.005]  If you look back at other times that this has happened, you'll see that everything else went down in value except gold.
[01:35:05.105 --> 01:35:09.146]  Sometimes silver would go down because it's basically a commercial metal.
[01:35:09.952 --> 01:35:11.853]  But gold will hold its own.
[01:35:12.414 --> 01:35:17.698]  In fact, it may even appreciate during that period of time, dependent upon the events.
[01:35:17.798 --> 01:35:27.385]  If gold goes to $2,000 an ounce, then gold will appreciate, as will all of the coins and the bars and the shares, etc.
[01:35:28.225 --> 01:35:35.091]  At the same time, we've already witnessed one fall in the stock market, which was about 50% to 60% back in 2000 and 2001.
[01:35:39.369 --> 01:35:45.573]  We've witnessed the fall in the median price of housing, which is somewhere around 30%.
[01:35:45.613 --> 01:35:51.758]  And the experts say it'll get down another 20%.
[01:35:52.458 --> 01:35:54.260]  So let's say the median house goes down 40%, 45%.
[01:35:56.041 --> 01:35:58.002]  That's not very good.
[01:35:58.583 --> 01:36:01.385]  And commercial real estate, they say, is going to get down 70%.
[01:36:02.405 --> 01:36:05.047]  So then we come to the stock market.
[01:36:05.568 --> 01:36:06.468]  We saw $6,600 on the Dow.
[01:36:06.488 --> 01:36:06.628]  It's $8,500.
[01:36:09.466 --> 01:36:10.266]  Why is it there?
[01:36:10.746 --> 01:36:14.387]  It's there because they don't want it to get out anymore at this time.
[01:36:14.767 --> 01:36:18.148]  So the Working Group on Financial Markets under the U.S.
[01:36:18.188 --> 01:36:21.028]  Treasury steps in and manipulates the market.
[01:36:21.528 --> 01:36:29.550]  And one of the strong reasons for that was to raise equity money for the financial firms that are all bankrupt.
[01:36:30.330 --> 01:36:35.351]  Now they got the stress test I explained earlier doesn't mean anything because they're lying about everything.
[01:36:35.831 --> 01:36:38.552]  And here we have prices
[01:36:39.452 --> 01:36:46.114]  On the stocks of financial companies that have doubled and tripled in the last two or three weeks.
[01:36:47.154 --> 01:36:48.335]  Well, that's all part of it.
[01:36:48.915 --> 01:36:52.456]  And they wanted this run up so they could go sell shares to suckers.
[01:36:53.737 --> 01:36:59.158]  And after they finished doing that, very shortly, the stock market's going back down again.
[01:37:00.299 --> 01:37:07.641]  And when it goes down, it'll affect any shares that you have, and with the exception of gold and silver shares, it will affect
[01:37:09.401 --> 01:37:27.770]  All of the pensions and profit sharing and IRAs, if that's what you get your investments in, it will affect bonds as well, because the 30-year bond and the 10-year note have just broken down below their 200-day moving averages, which is not good.
[01:37:28.891 --> 01:37:35.214]  And bond yields have started to climb, and when yields climb, the value of the bond falls.
[01:37:36.258 --> 01:37:44.285]  If you have, in some portfolio that you have, you have bonds, you're starting to lose money on them from what they were before.
[01:37:45.006 --> 01:37:48.069]  So, we can't go to real estate, either kind.
[01:37:49.089 --> 01:37:50.711]  We can't go to the stock market.
[01:37:51.111 --> 01:37:52.312]  We can't go to bonds.
[01:37:53.553 --> 01:37:56.876]  Jason, I don't know where else to go, but gold and silver.
[01:37:57.877 --> 01:38:03.262]  And as you said, and I've said often, we're looking at 6,000 years of history.
[01:38:04.246 --> 01:38:08.647]  When immutable gold had been the only real currency in the world.
[01:38:09.568 --> 01:38:18.591]  And we have a lock on wealth preservation by owning gold and gold and silver when we have the inflationary environment.
[01:38:19.451 --> 01:38:19.971]  Exactly.
[01:38:20.011 --> 01:38:23.573]  And a lot of people like to say, oh, gold and silver don't have any inherent value.
[01:38:23.593 --> 01:38:28.174]  And I'm like, well, why is it that throughout history it's been used and sought after?
[01:38:28.514 --> 01:38:30.395]  I can't see that going away.
[01:38:30.675 --> 01:38:33.616]  How can people, where should people go to get gold and silver right now?
[01:38:35.424 --> 01:38:36.345]  They go to Midas.
[01:38:37.527 --> 01:38:38.688]  That's where they should go.
[01:38:38.708 --> 01:38:51.145]  I mean, Ted Anderson breaks his neck putting all these programs on, telling the people in the world what's going on, and he funds that by having Midas?
[01:38:51.843 --> 01:38:54.124]  Which sells gold and silver coins and bars
[01:39:11.155 --> 01:39:13.456]  But doing so in a manner that will bring new people in.
[01:39:13.476 --> 01:39:16.377]  He didn't say the title of the book, he just said what was in the book.
[01:39:16.637 --> 01:39:21.179]  He said, you get this silver piece, and then he quoted Ron Paul as supporting the book.
[01:39:21.439 --> 01:39:23.420]  And that, that is a genius.
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:26.742]  I mean, we need more people to be brought into this information.
[01:39:26.962 --> 01:39:37.166]  And the creature from Jekyll Island is a great tool to wake people up to what's going on with this fiat currency and where it basically started, where its roots come from.
[01:39:39.076 --> 01:39:40.417]  Well, you're absolutely correct.
[01:39:40.577 --> 01:39:45.060]  This is at the very heart, the very genesis of our problem.
[01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:54.426]  Not only in America, but in other countries where they have the same kind of central bank privately owned setup.
[01:39:54.446 --> 01:39:56.208]  And we have to stop it.
[01:39:56.988 --> 01:40:03.493]  I remember when I was living in the Bahamas and one of the bankers said to me, well, the British own the central bank.
[01:40:04.313 --> 01:40:05.534]  I said, you got to be kidding me.
[01:40:06.397 --> 01:40:11.439]  Of course, the British left, what, 35, 40 years ago, you know, legally, so to speak.
[01:40:12.639 --> 01:40:14.760]  And I said, I don't believe it.
[01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:15.600]  And he said, yes.
[01:40:16.681 --> 01:40:18.401]  And so that has to stop.
[01:40:19.262 --> 01:40:23.643]  The banks that run countries have to belong to the government.
[01:40:24.363 --> 01:40:31.526]  And there's been a long fight in America over this between Alexander Hamilton and then Andrew Jackson.
[01:40:32.464 --> 01:40:38.446]  And who was probably one of the greatest presidents, because he saved us from the bankers, at least for a period of time.
[01:40:40.147 --> 01:40:42.627]  And so, this is the big fight.
[01:40:43.688 --> 01:40:45.388]  The fight against the bankers.
[01:40:46.028 --> 01:40:52.190]  The fight against fractional banking of 40 and 50 and 60 times.
[01:40:53.011 --> 01:40:55.391]  I mean, that is absolutely incredible.
[01:40:56.852 --> 01:40:59.793]  And that's what they would do if they were gambling like wild men.
[01:41:00.573 --> 01:41:08.097]  And if you want to arm yourself against these people, the best way to do so is go to Midas Resources, and here is the man himself behind Midas Resources, Ted Anderson.
[01:41:08.117 --> 01:41:08.977]  How are you doing today, Ted?
[01:41:10.238 --> 01:41:10.638]  Pretty good.
[01:41:10.658 --> 01:41:14.320]  I don't know how much of a genius I am when I'm just following Thomas Jefferson.
[01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:21.424]  I think he's the genius, and of course the people of Virginia that were supporting him at the time when the Union was being formed.
[01:41:21.444 --> 01:41:27.527]  I mean, one of the few groups that had the sense to stand up and say, hey, if you don't
[01:41:28.161 --> 01:41:34.322]  Uh, introduced to this constitutional agreement between the states, uh, the Bill of Rights.
[01:41:35.002 --> 01:41:36.482]  We will not join the union.
[01:41:36.943 --> 01:41:46.484]  And we also hold and reserve the right to separate ourselves from this union and have the ultimate veto authority over the Federation, which we're then forming.
[01:41:46.784 --> 01:41:47.464]  And I don't know why.
[01:41:47.484 --> 01:41:57.326]  I mean, it's nice to see that there are a few people that are recognizing that, uh, it's the few states that are recognizing that and are considering the, uh, the departure
[01:41:57.845 --> 01:42:08.071]  of the United States Union and therefore taking away the power from the Congress and the President of the United States.
[01:42:08.371 --> 01:42:10.633]  It's just one of the things that I'm passionate about.
[01:42:10.913 --> 01:42:16.837]  But you're right, and I appreciate you bringing that up about that commercial that you heard earlier.
[01:42:17.677 --> 01:42:24.141]  It's always been my passion, not necessarily become some rich eccentric billionaire because I'm selling gold and silver.
[01:42:24.716 --> 01:42:36.227]  Because just about everything I get, I turn over to try to educate and forward the... Well, the best thing about it, Ted, is you're not preaching to the choir.
[01:42:36.267 --> 01:42:39.790]  You're trying to bring in people who were like me before I was awake.
[01:42:39.890 --> 01:42:43.333]  People who listen to this stuff, and that's really the only talk radio they listen to.
[01:42:43.373 --> 01:42:45.535]  They may not be the most hip to politics.
[01:42:45.575 --> 01:42:46.356]  They may not know
[01:42:46.656 --> 01:42:47.677]  Well, that's the whole point.
[01:42:47.697 --> 01:42:52.279]  I mean, if we can wake the people up, and we don't have to have 100%, but if we can bring enough sound-minded people
[01:43:15.407 --> 01:43:36.383]  To this argument, and it is so neat to see this last presidential election be influenced by Ron Paul and have a good percentage of the people out there supporting the dismissal of the Federal Reserve System and fiat currency.
[01:43:37.084 --> 01:43:40.166]  You know, yesterday we talked about the Lakota coin at $17.71.
[01:43:42.935 --> 01:44:10.062]  And I don't know if people were buying those things like crazy because of the fact that it's silver is such a great buy at this time, or because people knew that the Lakota Nation is flying in the face of the Federal Reserve System and putting a $50 number on that thing, and they're a sovereign nation, and I'm sure that they have the right to have their own currency, and therefore the United States people, or at least the people that listen to the Alex Jones Show, would like to support such a thing.
[01:44:10.832 --> 01:44:11.932]  They did go up in price.
[01:44:11.992 --> 01:44:15.293]  We did sell out the supply, and like Alex said, they did go up in price.
[01:44:15.313 --> 01:44:16.994]  They're at $19.66.
[01:44:18.274 --> 01:44:24.236]  Obviously, a very steep discount to what they're trading for if you look on eBay and that kind of thing still.
[01:44:24.596 --> 01:44:31.438]  But yet, still a very solid response to that coin, and it just makes me smile.
[01:44:32.458 --> 01:44:38.080]  I have to say, real quick here, there are a few coins left that I accumulated when Silver was down there.
[01:44:39.083 --> 01:44:41.865]  Uh, at that, uh, $11.50 level.
[01:44:41.965 --> 01:44:47.787]  One of them is that Franklin coin, and they're still at $8.69, still the same price I had them for yesterday.
[01:44:48.248 --> 01:44:54.191]  In gold, the best buys that I have are the Franks at $2.14 and the British Sovereign at $2.67.
[01:44:54.631 --> 01:45:02.975]  Franks should really, literally, are priced right now at that, uh, $2.29 level, which $2.14 is obviously a very steep discount to that.
[01:45:03.315 --> 01:45:04.215]  British Sovereigns are at $2.67.
[01:45:06.088 --> 01:45:26.822]  I don't think you can find a better buyout in the marketplace right now, other than the coins that I have left over from when, you know, I mean, silver's at $14 an ounce now, gold right now is in the $900s, and obviously with gold at $286, silver at $1150, I was able to make some pretty good buys, and I would suggest that people take advantage of them.
[01:45:27.392 --> 01:45:35.600]  Exactly, and when they call up Midas Resources, and you're going to give out the number in a moment, make sure to mention you heard it here on Alex Jones so you can get all the greatest discounts from Ted.
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:36.901]  Ted, why don't you give out the number?
[01:45:37.442 --> 01:45:38.122]  Yeah, the number is 800-686-2237.
[01:45:38.143 --> 01:45:38.643]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:45:38.663 --> 01:45:40.365]  I'll say it one more time, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:45:53.131 --> 01:46:13.275]  Bob, you're just making such a strong and solid point and talking about the fiat currency system that we have now and the arguments that go all the way back to Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson and the people from Virginia back in the 1700s when this nation was being formed.
[01:46:13.855 --> 01:46:17.575]  And Andrew Jackson, there's an article you can Google, it's called
[01:46:22.483 --> 01:46:22.703]  What is it?
[01:46:22.743 --> 01:46:26.706]  It's the monster from... I don't have it here off the top of my head.
[01:46:26.746 --> 01:46:30.949]  It's on the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank website.
[01:46:30.989 --> 01:46:32.330]  I'll just pull it out here in a little bit.
[01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:48.182]  I'll be able to give you... It's the monster from Chestnut Street, and that was Biddle's Bank back in the early 1800s in the fight between Biddle and Andrew Jackson, which actually ended up... Biddle actually
[01:46:49.185 --> 01:46:59.168]  Uh, tightened up the money supply to the point where it caused a depression at that particular time because Andrew Jackson was stepping in and trying to close down that banking system.
[01:46:59.848 --> 01:47:10.691]  Way too much power being handed to a private agency and the argument that they're saying with the Federal Reserve System because there's a board of governors, there's many different banks rather than one that control the system.
[01:47:11.069 --> 01:47:13.410]  That it's different, and I'm saying it's not different at all.
[01:47:13.690 --> 01:47:16.852]  There's a few people that are able to siphon off the wealth of a nation.
[01:47:17.593 --> 01:47:24.737]  Every time we go to work, we pay close to 40%, depending upon where you're at in the tax bracket in taxes.
[01:47:25.077 --> 01:47:34.142]  That wealth just gets siphoned right into the hands of these few individuals, and that's why you see this elite group that's able to control not only just the United States, but the world.
[01:47:34.522 --> 01:47:38.304]  So if there is one point that I can make here supporting Alex Jones,
[01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:58.277]  His Obama deception in the many great documentaries that he's done is that if we can stop this central banking system from being able to siphon that wealth away from the people, they will lose the very engine, the very mechanism that gives them the power to do this.
[01:47:58.377 --> 01:48:00.179]  It is the only way to stop them.
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:14.430]  If you pass laws, if you take away their wealth but leave them with the central banking system, they will buy all their power right back again and it'll just be turned right back into the system that we're living in with a different face and a different design.
[01:48:14.890 --> 01:48:21.655]  I mean, just because we have a black man for president doesn't mean that the system that we're living in has changed.
[01:48:21.855 --> 01:48:23.516]  It just has a new face, that's all.
[01:48:23.957 --> 01:48:28.600]  And it's still the same economic controls being handed down by the same group
[01:48:29.173 --> 01:48:31.414]  And it just simply has to stop.
[01:48:31.454 --> 01:48:40.457]  If we want to have liberty in this nation, if that's what the United States is about, having individual liberty, then you best end this Federal Reserve System.
[01:48:40.798 --> 01:48:51.502]  And the only thing I can say is if the United States isn't smart enough to get back onto a gold standard, we the people of the United States of America better put ourselves on a gold standard.
[01:48:51.542 --> 01:48:54.303]  And that's why I'm suggesting these British sovereigns and Franks.
[01:48:54.703 --> 01:48:56.364]  You need to move, and you need to move now.
[01:48:57.645 --> 01:48:59.766]  Tarp and all these different government bailouts.
[01:48:59.826 --> 01:49:01.687]  It's all about turning on a printing press.
[01:49:02.048 --> 01:49:06.690]  And when they run that printing press, they're taking money from us, and they're not even showing up at our door.
[01:49:06.710 --> 01:49:10.253]  They're stealing our wealth away from us, and you better do something about it.
[01:49:10.293 --> 01:49:22.620]  If you're sitting in a 401k plan, or if you have an IRA sitting in the stock market, if you have annuities, if you have money in the bank, if you're invested in the stock market, in the real estate market, it doesn't seem to matter.
[01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:24.101]  You better have yourselves
[01:49:24.485 --> 01:49:31.391]  Your hands in something that's held value for thousands and thousands of years, and gold and silver, it just happens to be the item that makes that work.
[01:49:31.991 --> 01:49:32.452]  Exactly.
[01:49:32.532 --> 01:49:38.917]  Folks, if you truly want to empower yourself and get beyond this control grid, you need to go to Midas Resources right now.
[01:49:39.217 --> 01:49:40.658]  Get some gold, get some silver.
[01:49:40.678 --> 01:49:41.919]  What's the number one more time, Ted?
[01:49:41.999 --> 01:49:46.123]  The number is 1-800-686-2237.
[01:49:46.183 --> 01:49:49.886]  Again, please mention that you've heard it on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:49:50.347 --> 01:49:52.508]  Otherwise, you're going to have to pay today's prices.
[01:49:52.568 --> 01:50:03.114]  Yesterday, if people went to buy the Lakota rounds from us, and you didn't mention that you heard it on the Alex Jones Show, you would have had to pay $19.66 instead of $17.71.
[01:50:04.394 --> 01:50:06.796]  The time is now to move.
[01:50:07.176 --> 01:50:07.796]  You can see it.
[01:50:07.836 --> 01:50:13.199]  It's as plain as the nose on your face that the economic system here in the United States is failing.
[01:50:13.652 --> 01:50:29.981]  I mean, even the people in China who are socialists and communists and live in a totalitarian regime understand that gold is more valuable than the United States' paper currency, and they're raising their reserves over 78% from just a couple years ago.
[01:50:30.241 --> 01:50:33.102]  They want to get into having real money.
[01:50:33.503 --> 01:50:34.223]  So call us at 800-686-2237.
[01:50:34.263 --> 01:50:35.624]  At least be as smart as the Chinese.
[01:50:40.356 --> 01:50:46.725]  Absolutely, and don't forget to go to theinternationalforecaster.com and subscribe to Bob Chapman's newsletter.
[01:50:46.945 --> 01:50:49.028]  Folks, we've got breaking news on the other side.
[01:50:49.068 --> 01:50:50.069]  We'll be back after this.
[01:50:50.129 --> 01:50:51.071]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:51:01.365 --> 01:51:02.626]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.666 --> 01:51:08.029]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.269 --> 01:51:12.891]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.271 --> 01:51:18.354]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.854 --> 01:51:23.557]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:24.077 --> 01:51:25.938]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:51:26.383 --> 01:51:31.006]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.186 --> 01:51:32.087]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.307 --> 01:51:35.089]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:35.389 --> 01:51:38.671]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.991 --> 01:51:41.833]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:42.193 --> 01:51:44.075]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:44.415 --> 01:51:45.336]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.356 --> 01:51:45.736]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.756 --> 01:51:46.676]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:51:55.495 --> 01:51:57.716]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:58.036 --> 01:52:00.476]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:01.796 --> 01:52:07.098]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.598 --> 01:52:14.579]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:52:15.180 --> 01:52:21.341]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:21.761 --> 01:52:23.603]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:23.743 --> 01:52:26.165]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:26.245 --> 01:52:37.234]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:52:37.814 --> 01:52:39.115]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.515 --> 01:52:40.877]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:41.357 --> 01:52:47.582]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:57.662]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:58.103 --> 01:52:59.305]  The people strike back!
[01:53:01.027 --> 01:53:02.529]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:04.171]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:53:04.471 --> 01:53:06.694]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:53:07.154 --> 01:53:11.900]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:15.124]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[01:54:20.382 --> 01:54:35.129]  All right, folks, you never know what's going to happen on the Alex Jones Show, but we have breaking news coming from Randall Terry, who founded the pro-life organization Operation Rescue and is currently heading up Stop Obama Notre Dame.
[01:54:35.189 --> 01:54:37.590]  It's concerning political figure Alan Keyes.
[01:54:38.370 --> 01:54:39.490]  Randall, give us the news.
[01:54:40.791 --> 01:54:44.753]  Alan Keyes and over 20 other pro-life people are sitting behind bars right now.
[01:54:45.433 --> 01:54:47.434]  Most of them will spend the weekend in jail.
[01:54:48.203 --> 01:54:54.869]  And the reason is because Notre Dame, who claims to want dialogue over the killing of Bibi Innocent, arrested them.
[01:54:55.349 --> 01:55:08.980]  What they did was they walked on campus quietly, peacefully, praying with baby strollers with dolls in them covered with stage blood as a testimony of what President Obama is doing.
[01:55:10.161 --> 01:55:13.384]  And the police corralled them all and threw them in jail.
[01:55:13.404 --> 01:55:14.145]  They're in jail right now.
[01:55:14.554 --> 01:55:34.209]  Well, I'm sure that you've seen this latest domestic extremism lexicon from the DHS, and right here on the second page, anti-abortionism, extremism, a movement of groups or individuals who are vehemently anti-abortion and advocate violence, obviously you're violent, against providers of abortion-related services, their employees and their facilities.
[01:55:34.469 --> 01:55:35.010]  Oh, and also,
[01:55:35.530 --> 01:55:40.432]  Some say various racist and anti-semitic beliefs to justify their criminal activity.
[01:55:40.452 --> 01:55:44.534]  So they're trying to lump you in with violent criminals who are anti-semitic.
[01:55:44.574 --> 01:55:45.474]  How do you feel about that?
[01:55:46.334 --> 01:55:49.736]  Well, there's nothing like having false witness born against you.
[01:55:50.216 --> 01:55:56.298]  Obviously you can see what a grave threat it is to have baby carriages carrying baby dolls, but let's go a step beyond this.
[01:55:57.039 --> 01:55:59.800]  This is not just the federal government saying that we're bad people.
[01:56:00.498 --> 01:56:10.906]  This is Notre Dame, a Catholic college, who has put people in jail for defending life, and they're going to honor a man whose policies kill life.
[01:56:11.926 --> 01:56:15.469]  I mean, the irony and the perversion could not be more stark.
[01:56:16.270 --> 01:56:18.031]  So, here's our goal.
[01:56:18.111 --> 01:56:19.192]  I know our time is limited.
[01:56:19.912 --> 01:56:23.355]  Our goal is to have over 100 people arrested over the next seven days.
[01:56:24.205 --> 01:56:33.753]  And if we can have 30 or 40 or 50 people sitting in jail here the weekend where Obama is speaking, that will make international news.
[01:56:34.333 --> 01:56:35.634]  Well, tell people how they can do that.
[01:56:36.435 --> 01:56:38.156]  People say, I wish the Pope could hear my voice.
[01:56:38.196 --> 01:56:39.037]  Listen, go to jail.
[01:56:39.077 --> 01:56:39.858]  He'll hear your voice.
[01:56:41.079 --> 01:56:42.080]  Well, how can people do that?
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:45.022]  How can people support you in this very short segment that we have with you?
[01:56:45.282 --> 01:56:46.783]  What websites do they need to go to?
[01:56:46.843 --> 01:56:47.904]  How can they contact you?
[01:56:47.944 --> 01:56:48.805]  How can they get involved?
[01:56:49.646 --> 01:56:52.068]  StopObamaNoturdame.com.
[01:56:53.252 --> 01:56:54.254]  All one long word.
[01:56:54.274 --> 01:56:55.976]  StopObamaNotreDame.com.
[01:56:55.996 --> 01:56:57.638]  Number one of the most important thing.
[01:56:58.587 --> 01:57:05.128]  If I had a hundred people that said, I'll give you a thousand bucks, or a hundred people that said, I'll come and go to jail, man, I would take the hundred bodies in jail in a heartbeat!
[01:57:05.628 --> 01:57:11.069]  Because we have a chance here, like with Rosa Parks, to have a flashpoint where we actually make history.
[01:57:11.730 --> 01:57:14.330]  So, go to StopObamaNotreDame.com.
[01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:15.770]  The directions are there.
[01:57:16.130 --> 01:57:18.211]  You'll see Alan Keyes' letter, why he's doing this.
[01:57:18.231 --> 01:57:21.651]  You can see his conversation with the police yesterday before they arrested him.
[01:57:22.031 --> 01:57:23.752]  It's a very compelling YouTube video.
[01:57:25.072 --> 01:57:27.713]  This is not something where we're looking for people to just watch.
[01:57:27.753 --> 01:57:29.314]  We're looking for people to join us.
[01:57:29.794 --> 01:57:34.095]  And then of course if someone wants to give a contribution to help us buy more baby carriages.
[01:57:34.296 --> 01:57:38.477]  We spent $400 on baby carriages last night and the police confiscated all of them.
[01:57:38.897 --> 01:57:40.638]  We're going to do it again and again and again.
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:42.540]  Well, absolutely.
[01:57:42.621 --> 01:57:44.802]  And you know, that's what we do on this show.
[01:57:44.842 --> 01:57:48.404]  We provide people with an outlet to make change.
[01:57:48.424 --> 01:57:50.246]  You know, we are trying to provide solutions.
[01:57:50.286 --> 01:57:55.609]  So if this is an issue that is close to your heart, obviously it should be an issue whether you're an anti-abortionist or not.
[01:57:55.649 --> 01:57:58.131]  They're arresting people for free speech.
[01:57:58.191 --> 01:57:59.852]  This is anti-First Amendment.
[01:57:59.872 --> 01:58:01.453]  These people should not be in jail.
[01:58:01.813 --> 01:58:05.416]  And we need to make it clear that we're not going to stop protesting.
[01:58:05.756 --> 01:58:09.318]  And the website is StopObamaNotreDame.com.
[01:58:09.679 --> 01:58:11.540]  Anything else you got for me in the last 30 seconds?
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:15.101]  Yes, people have a chance to make history.
[01:58:15.641 --> 01:58:20.763]  And God and his angels and demons and bad people, everyone is watching to see what we do.
[01:58:21.403 --> 01:58:26.325]  And if you want your voice to be heard, it doesn't happen just in cyberspace or on email.
[01:58:26.665 --> 01:58:28.025]  Come here on the ground.
[01:58:28.065 --> 01:58:32.326]  Whether you'll be arrested with us or not, come here on the ground and let your voice be heard.
[01:58:33.027 --> 01:58:35.327]  Randall Terry, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:35.407 --> 01:58:37.388]  Go help Alan Keyes right now.
[01:58:37.568 --> 01:58:38.288]  Stop Obama.
[01:58:38.308 --> 01:58:40.069]  Notre Dame.com will be back after this.
[01:58:43.086 --> 01:58:45.127]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.687 --> 01:58:50.089]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.170 --> 01:58:51.750]  Hello, friends.
[01:58:51.790 --> 01:58:52.751]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.851 --> 01:58:57.473]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.593 --> 01:59:00.354]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.555 --> 01:59:03.436]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.616 --> 01:59:09.439]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.679 --> 01:59:12.661]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:12.922 --> 01:59:19.807]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:19.907 --> 01:59:23.030]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:59:23.190 --> 01:59:23.390]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:23.450 --> 01:59:25.091]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:28.334 --> 01:59:34.418]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-stride, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:59:34.598 --> 01:59:38.440]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:38.460 --> 01:59:40.321]  Again, 1-800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:59:40.341 --> 01:59:41.382]  Take action today.
[01:59:41.422 --> 01:59:43.403]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:59:54.048 --> 01:59:55.949]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.429 --> 01:59:59.311]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.675 --> 02:00:06.335]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.995 --> 02:00:08.076]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.756 --> 02:00:09.917]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.517 --> 02:00:11.358]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.118 --> 02:00:13.079]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.679 --> 02:00:17.321]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.842 --> 02:00:21.904]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.272 --> 02:00:34.772]  Alright folks, we are back live.
[02:00:34.832 --> 02:00:38.433]  It's the Alex Jones Show this May 8th, Friday 2009.
[02:00:38.893 --> 02:00:40.093]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting in.
[02:00:41.014 --> 02:00:44.734]  We've got Chris Pinto in this segment of the America's Secret Beginning series.
[02:00:44.774 --> 02:00:46.715]  The latest, of course, is Eye of the Phoenix.
[02:00:46.735 --> 02:00:51.776]  You can get that over at InfoWars.com or if you get all three, basically we're only going to charge you for two.
[02:00:51.796 --> 02:00:52.156]  $59.95 gets you
[02:00:53.596 --> 02:01:00.223]  All three films over at the Info Wars shop and I had Pinto on my program probably about a month ago.
[02:01:00.303 --> 02:01:03.507]  I do a little radio show here, The Info Warrior, 9 to midnight.
[02:01:04.247 --> 02:01:06.089]  And it was just a great conversation.
[02:01:06.149 --> 02:01:08.552]  I really love this guy's work.
[02:01:08.612 --> 02:01:08.812]  I mean...
[02:01:09.733 --> 02:01:12.294]  I think David Bay is the other guy, but I've seen all three of these.
[02:01:12.694 --> 02:01:13.754]  They are extensive.
[02:01:14.194 --> 02:01:19.796]  You don't have to agree with every point to see that something is going on here, and they're just so well-researched and well-done.
[02:01:20.336 --> 02:01:23.437]  It's really comparable to something that the History Channel would put out.
[02:01:23.737 --> 02:01:27.938]  So it's very digestible for people that don't know about this information.
[02:01:28.278 --> 02:01:29.619]  I'd like to thank Chris for joining us.
[02:01:29.659 --> 02:01:30.579]  How are you doing today, sir?
[02:01:31.259 --> 02:01:32.379]  I'm doing great, Jason.
[02:01:32.419 --> 02:01:32.860]  How are you?
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:34.120]  I am good, man.
[02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:36.981]  You know, Eye of the Phoenix is the latest one.
[02:01:38.411 --> 02:01:48.981]  Really just excellent, goes really deeply into Nicholas Rorick, Manley P. Hall, Franklin D. Roosevelt, the people under Roosevelt, and really the secrets of the dollar bill.
[02:01:49.061 --> 02:01:58.110]  It shows you why this Illuminati symbol, this all-seeing eye symbol, is on the back of the dollar bill, how it got there, and so much more.
[02:01:58.410 --> 02:02:01.713]  Why don't you tell people how you got started on this entire series, because it's almost
[02:02:02.674 --> 02:02:06.016]  I've been studying New World Order information for close to ten years now and making documentaries about it.
[02:02:23.684 --> 02:02:47.624]  When I was doing some of the early research on the New World Order, I came across this whole doctrine about America as the New Atlantis, and this information about Sir Francis Bacon, and this plan supposedly that went back thousands of years that looks to the ancient philosophers like Plato and Pythagoras and others, and that this plan had somehow or other been handed down.
[02:02:48.254 --> 02:02:53.716]  Over the centuries, at least, this is what's believed by certain writers of arcane lore.
[02:02:54.417 --> 02:03:17.226]  And that it was picked up by Francis Bacon and Dr. John Dee in England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. And that they had this vision when America was discovered, when Columbus makes his discovery in 1492, and then this knowledge now of this new world comes to Europe.
[02:03:17.774 --> 02:03:23.876]  Men like Bacon believed that what they had really discovered was the lost continent of Atlantis.
[02:03:24.777 --> 02:03:35.341]  Not symbolically or metaphorically, they didn't believe Atlantis was, you know, beneath the ocean as some, on the Discovery Channel and so on, you know, scuba divers going, looking up under the water.
[02:03:35.701 --> 02:03:41.603]  They believed that this continent that you and I are sitting on, that this was the site of ancient Atlantis.
[02:03:42.432 --> 02:03:52.541]  And they believed that it was, you know, mystical, it was symbolic, that there was a reason why the gods, if you will, had revealed it to mankind.
[02:03:53.202 --> 02:04:03.531]  And that from this land, mankind would have a new beginning, and would somehow or other resurrect the
[02:04:04.281 --> 02:04:16.824]  You know, the ancient Atlantis, which, according to legends and so on, was not just a city or an island, but it was a commonwealth that extended to all the world.
[02:04:17.084 --> 02:04:22.125]  Ultimately, Atlantis reigned over the whole Earth at that time, or at least according to the legends.
[02:04:22.845 --> 02:04:32.627]  And so they envisioned a new Atlantis going forth that would be based on these new philosophic ideas that Bacon had.
[02:04:33.431 --> 02:04:38.392]  And that this would ultimately envelop the world and develop into a global society.
[02:04:38.752 --> 02:04:43.553]  Yeah, develop into what they call their ideal system, the New World Order.
[02:04:43.933 --> 02:04:47.094]  Again, that's a phrase and a term that they use and we report on.
[02:04:47.134 --> 02:04:51.295]  We'll be back after this with America's Secret Beginning Zone, Chris Pinto.
[02:04:51.775 --> 02:04:52.635]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:52.655 --> 02:04:53.775]  I'm Jason Burmas, sitting in.
[02:04:54.015 --> 02:04:56.276]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[02:05:01.368 --> 02:05:01.928]  You worry.
[02:05:02.068 --> 02:05:04.149]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[02:05:04.409 --> 02:05:04.709]  Hi.
[02:05:04.969 --> 02:05:07.449]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[02:05:07.749 --> 02:05:11.990]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[02:05:12.290 --> 02:05:14.471]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[02:05:14.751 --> 02:05:17.811]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[02:05:18.111 --> 02:05:19.832]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[02:05:20.032 --> 02:05:22.572]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[02:05:22.832 --> 02:05:26.233]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[02:05:26.553 --> 02:05:30.594]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[02:05:30.954 --> 02:05:34.756]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[02:05:35.056 --> 02:05:41.059]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[02:05:41.380 --> 02:05:43.521]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[02:05:43.741 --> 02:05:45.422]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[02:05:45.862 --> 02:05:50.064]  So go to upthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:05:50.524 --> 02:05:51.165]  Start now.
[02:05:51.425 --> 02:05:52.385]  Knowledge is power.
[02:05:53.146 --> 02:05:53.946]  Better take action.
[02:05:54.146 --> 02:05:55.107]  I think a storm's coming.
[02:06:01.863 --> 02:06:07.185]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:07.666 --> 02:06:14.669]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:06:15.248 --> 02:06:21.471]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:06:21.831 --> 02:06:23.672]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:06:23.812 --> 02:06:26.234]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:06:26.314 --> 02:06:37.239]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:06:37.899 --> 02:06:39.180]  It's not about left or right.
[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:40.921]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:06:41.408 --> 02:06:47.752]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:06:48.312 --> 02:06:56.137]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com, or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:56.597 --> 02:06:57.758]  The Obama Deception.
[02:06:58.158 --> 02:06:59.439]  The people strike back.
[02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:02.161]  Ah, springtime.
[02:07:02.581 --> 02:07:07.764]  Now that you've planted your organic garden, how will you keep the bugs away without using toxic chemicals and poisons?
[02:07:08.097 --> 02:07:12.561]  Well, the answer is all natural insecticides from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[02:07:12.702 --> 02:07:18.447]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP to kill parasites.
[02:07:18.688 --> 02:07:26.976]  We then add a small amount of pyrethrin from chrysanthemum flowers and a mild attractant to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[02:07:27.296 --> 02:07:29.978]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.
[02:07:30.278 --> 02:07:36.482]  Our natural insecticides work in the home, on plants, and in your garden, killing pests mechanically, not with poisons.

[02:08:01.279 --> 02:08:06.323]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.684 --> 02:08:09.026]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:14.410 --> 02:08:21.556]  Alright folks, we are back.
[02:08:21.616 --> 02:08:22.456]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:23.559 --> 02:08:33.687]  I am Jason Burmiss sitting in, and we are joined by Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings writer and director of all three parts, Chris Pinto.
[02:08:34.778 --> 02:08:56.826]  And Chris, you know, all of these really touch on similar ideas, and it progresses, but that one idea of the creation of this new global governance, this new world order, you refer to it as possibly world democracy, you get into masonry, secret societies, the architecture of DC, and in the latest one,
[02:08:59.288 --> 02:09:04.312]  I want to get into that Matreya figure a little bit later and how that may coincide with the Bohemian Grove.
[02:09:04.372 --> 02:09:17.624]  I sent you a couple pictures after our discussion the last time, but why don't you give an overview of people like Benjamin Franklin and Queen Elizabeth who are featured in the first one of these, the New Atlantis.
[02:09:19.028 --> 02:09:22.230]  Well, Queen Elizabeth, she's a very interesting character.
[02:09:22.270 --> 02:09:30.493]  I mean, she preferred the, you know, at the time, the politics of England were very much Protestant England against Catholic Europe.
[02:09:31.094 --> 02:09:38.637]  And the Pope had excommunicated Elizabeth and was trying to have her assassinated, basically.
[02:09:38.998 --> 02:09:41.819]  And so you had all of these spies, you had Jesuits, you had
[02:09:43.046 --> 02:09:57.874]  Very zealous Catholics who, according to the Catholic Doctrine at that time, if a monarch were communicated by the Pope, then Catholics who were faithful had a responsibility not to obey that monarch first, and second, to try and kill them.
[02:09:58.514 --> 02:10:03.957]  And so this created, you know, a climate of potential assassination around Elizabeth.
[02:10:04.497 --> 02:10:11.461]  So what happened was the English formed a number of groups, at least one in particular, the Rosicrucians.
[02:10:12.459 --> 02:10:16.444]  Uh, who formed around Elizabeth to protect her from assassination.
[02:10:16.924 --> 02:10:27.456]  So they developed a, uh, an intelligence network where they were, uh, involved with ciphers and secret codes and all this other kind of stuff.
[02:10:27.897 --> 02:10:31.621]  And Bacon and John D. In fact, John D. is the original Agent 007.
[02:10:33.352 --> 02:10:41.717]  Uh, he was the inspiration for Ian Fleming's whole James Bond series, because Dee would sign his correspondence to the Queen, 007.
[02:10:43.558 --> 02:10:44.799]  He's also the original...
[02:10:45.730 --> 02:10:58.395]  Uh, magus or wizard figure, uh, that inspired, uh, Dr. Faustus, inspired Gandalf from Lord of the Rings, inspired Albus Dumbledore from the Harry Potter books and so on.
[02:10:58.995 --> 02:11:13.100]  Uh, so Dr. John Dee's a very interesting character, but he was the Queen's astrologer and he had, um, he had a powerful influence over Queen Elizabeth and apparently on Sir Francis Bacon.
[02:11:13.775 --> 02:11:19.676]  But Dee was the head of the Rosicrucians for a time, and then he handed off the reins to Bacon.
[02:11:20.177 --> 02:11:29.319]  Bacon ends up financing the Virginia Company, heavily financing the Virginia Company that then comes to Jamestown in 1607.
[02:11:30.659 --> 02:11:42.162]  And if you look at the Great Seal of Virginia today, the Seal of Virginia has a picture of a female goddess wearing a helm and a spear, okay?
[02:11:42.402 --> 02:11:43.302]  And she's got her foot
[02:11:43.943 --> 02:11:47.946]  On the throne of like a fallen, or on the neck of a fallen tyrant.
[02:11:48.727 --> 02:11:51.910]  And the goddess, if you look at her very carefully, they give her another name.
[02:11:52.310 --> 02:11:56.773]  But she is almost the exact image of Pallas Athena.
[02:11:56.914 --> 02:12:02.018]  And Pallas Athena was the goddess that Francis Bacon claimed was his muse.
[02:12:02.838 --> 02:12:05.541]  His inspiration and so on of wisdom and what not.
[02:12:06.241 --> 02:12:12.166]  So now you fast forward into American history, a hundred and some odd years later, and you've got Benjamin Franklin.
[02:12:12.754 --> 02:12:20.960]  Benjamin Franklin was, in his day, like a latter-day Francis Bacon.
[02:12:21.060 --> 02:12:24.923]  Bacon was the father of the modern scientific method.
[02:12:25.323 --> 02:12:29.426]  He developed all of these ciphers and secret codes, had books on them and so on.
[02:12:29.926 --> 02:12:34.910]  Very involved in printing and literature and writing and publishing things and so on.
[02:12:35.930 --> 02:12:38.572]  And Benjamin Franklin was involved in all the same things.
[02:12:38.592 --> 02:12:48.718]  A lot of people don't realize, we know Franklin from the discovery of electricity, but he had a number of scientific inventions, the bifocals and so on.
[02:12:49.919 --> 02:12:54.602]  But he was very involved in science, very involved in writing and printing, even as Bacon was.
[02:12:55.102 --> 02:12:58.264]  And he even published a book on Cipher's secret codes.
[02:12:58.924 --> 02:13:01.566]  But he was, during the American Revolution,
[02:13:02.697 --> 02:13:09.959]  What Bacon was during the time of Queen Elizabeth, because Bacon was a part of this whole intelligence network to protect the Queen.
[02:13:10.659 --> 02:13:22.881]  And Franklin was really the special forces intelligence guy during the American Revolution, working on behalf of America over in Europe.
[02:13:23.021 --> 02:13:30.903]  He was in France, he was in England, he was a member of secret societies in America, England, and France.
[02:13:31.593 --> 02:13:35.597]  The three countries that were all involved in the American Revolution.
[02:13:35.977 --> 02:13:40.701]  And these secret societies, by the way, are the precursors to today's intelligence networks.
[02:13:40.741 --> 02:13:42.943]  I mean, that is, that's even mainline.
[02:13:42.983 --> 02:13:58.036]  I mean, in The Good Shepherd, the film by Robert De Niro starring Matt Damon, they openly show you that they used Yale as a recruitment tool for people in skull and bones, which was yet another precursor to these intelligence agencies, to bring in the CIA and the OSS.
[02:13:59.944 --> 02:14:00.565]  Absolutely.
[02:14:00.645 --> 02:14:15.616]  I mean, Her Majesty's Secret Service, you know, MI5, MI6, and all of that in England was with Walsingham, who was working with Bacon, John D., all of these guys.
[02:14:15.976 --> 02:14:18.538]  This is how they developed their secret code system.
[02:14:19.219 --> 02:14:27.365]  It's brought to America, and from America, as you said, it ultimately unfolds into our, you know, the OSS and then the CIA today.
[02:14:28.252 --> 02:14:32.733]  Uh, but it's a very interesting history, but it's all based on these secret societies.
[02:14:33.573 --> 02:14:38.615]  Um, and, uh, and so Franklin was, uh, very, very interesting.
[02:14:38.655 --> 02:14:56.979]  In fact, there are some people who have written books about Franklin calling him a spymaster and even questioning his loyalty to the United States during the Revolutionary War because he, it came out years after the war that, uh, uh, Franklin had a double agent.
[02:14:57.817 --> 02:15:06.280]  Uh, a British spy that was working on his staff, and that he'd been warned about many times, but he never did anything, uh, to get rid of the guy.
[02:15:06.620 --> 02:15:11.001]  And there's actually a book out there called Ben Franklin Patriot or Spy.
[02:15:11.021 --> 02:15:20.784]  Um, and, uh, it's called Number 23 Ben Franklin Patriot or Spy because Franklin's codename with British intelligence was Number 23.
[02:15:22.746 --> 02:15:25.829]  Uh, and or number 72, sorry, number 72.
[02:15:26.169 --> 02:15:27.651]  And he was also called Moses.
[02:15:27.811 --> 02:15:29.072]  That was his other nickname.
[02:15:29.813 --> 02:15:34.837]  But Franklin was involved with a secret group in England called the Hellfire Club.
[02:15:35.418 --> 02:15:41.383]  And you mentioned this last time I was on the radio with you, Jason, about, uh, you know, Franklin and the Hellfire Club.
[02:15:41.443 --> 02:15:46.848]  And then now they found in the 1990s, they dug up his home there in London.
[02:15:47.549 --> 02:15:49.531]  And found all of these dead bodies.
[02:15:49.751 --> 02:15:52.533]  You know, the bones of these cadavers and so on.
[02:15:52.813 --> 02:15:54.674]  And that's mainline news, by the way.
[02:15:54.714 --> 02:15:57.676]  That's not just me and you talking about it or some obscure author.
[02:15:57.696 --> 02:16:00.178]  I think it was like London Telegraph or Guardian.
[02:16:00.218 --> 02:16:02.200]  I mean, it was as mainline as it could get.
[02:16:03.303 --> 02:16:11.885]  Yeah, in fact, today they've turned his home into a museum where you can go there and they actually have some of the bones.
[02:16:11.925 --> 02:16:17.827]  They found not only the bones of adults and children, but they found animal bones beneath those.
[02:16:19.768 --> 02:16:28.250]  I've seen a few pictures of the remains and they look like they're sort of blackened in places and charred, almost as if they had been burned.
[02:16:29.100 --> 02:16:37.743]  And, you know, one of the things that satanic groups do, they have human sacrifices, but they also have animal sacrifices as well.
[02:16:38.523 --> 02:16:49.767]  And, you know, we can only wonder, their official explanation is that there was a medical school in Franklin's home for like a year and a half or two years, and that that's where the bodies came from.
[02:16:51.967 --> 02:16:57.129]  But still, he was, you know, deeply involved with this Hellfire group.
[02:16:57.907 --> 02:17:10.814]  That had been founded by Sir Francis Dashwood, and Dashwood was like a close advisor to King George III, who was the king we were fighting against in the American Revolution.
[02:17:10.914 --> 02:17:27.622]  Dashwood was a member of the House of Commons, the House of Lords, he was a prominent member, and there were other political figures that were a part of this group that called themselves the Monks of Medbenden Abbey, but their nickname was the Hellfire Club.
[02:17:28.502 --> 02:17:45.639]  And I believe the Hellfire Club, if you study them and what they were into, I believe they were a precursor to the Bohemian Grove Club that you guys exposed in Alex Jones' video, you know, showing the rituals in the Bohemian Grove.
[02:17:46.118 --> 02:17:51.841]  Some of those guys are dressed up like Catholic priests and cardinals and so on.
[02:17:51.861 --> 02:17:52.101]  Exactly.
[02:17:52.121 --> 02:17:55.943]  The head guy wears what looks like a Pope hat.
[02:17:55.963 --> 02:18:03.887]  He's in a long robe and he has himself a staff as he gives this very Babylonian Gaia worship ritual.
[02:18:04.147 --> 02:18:08.009]  And then at the end of the ritual, someone rose in on a boat, gives him an effigy of a baby.
[02:18:08.069 --> 02:18:18.253]  Meanwhile, there are probably a dozen or so other gentlemen holding torches in what appear to be druidic-like outfits waiting for this cremation of care, if you will.
[02:18:18.573 --> 02:18:23.335]  And then they drop the body on this fiery, you know, altar in front of
[02:18:23.675 --> 02:18:28.979]  The Owl God, Moloch, this 40 foot statue that's hollowed out and has a little sound system in it.
[02:18:29.299 --> 02:18:34.102]  Everybody starts cheering and fireworks go off and that's the kickoff of this ceremony.
[02:18:34.142 --> 02:18:34.683]  Very Christian.
[02:18:35.919 --> 02:18:38.000]  Yeah, well, exactly.
[02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:47.345]  But all those elements, well at least the dressing up like popes and cardinals and bishops and this kind of thing, the Hellfire Club did all of that.
[02:18:47.805 --> 02:18:58.190]  They also had a statue, which they have sort of a parallel of at the Bohemian Grove, they had a statue as you went into their underground.
[02:18:58.860 --> 02:18:59.601]  Are you sure?
[02:19:16.403 --> 02:19:28.432]  And, you know, later on in the program, probably after we go over Riddles in Stone in the next segment, I want to go over this Maitreya figure that is also at the Bohemian Grove, and also very, very large.
[02:19:28.672 --> 02:19:45.564]  You know, it seems that the more information we get about the Grove, the more into the occult they are, the more they are into, you know, all these different mystery religions, all these things outside of Christianity, and, you know, they all, not all of them, but, you know, the people like the Bush family, oh, we're Christian conservatives, really, what are you doing?
[02:19:46.084 --> 02:19:47.165]  At the Bohemian Grove.
[02:19:47.506 --> 02:19:51.390]  And this Matreya figure is just as massive as this Moloch figure.
[02:19:51.450 --> 02:19:52.912]  We're going to go over that on the other side.
[02:19:53.453 --> 02:19:55.015]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:55.315 --> 02:19:56.076]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[02:19:56.096 --> 02:19:57.057]  We'll be back after this.
[02:19:57.137 --> 02:19:58.679]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:20:03.712 --> 02:20:04.292]  We're good to go!
[02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:29.260]  I think so.
[02:20:47.688 --> 02:20:50.430]  For a short tell-all video, go to hazardrid.com.

[02:20:54.373 --> 02:20:57.115]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:21:08.167 --> 02:21:13.510]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:21:14.031 --> 02:21:20.234]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:20.535 --> 02:21:22.356]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:22.496 --> 02:21:24.917]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:21:24.977 --> 02:21:35.864]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:21:38.155 --> 02:21:39.415]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:39.815 --> 02:21:41.196]  It's about a one world government.
[02:21:41.676 --> 02:21:48.037]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:21:56.839 --> 02:21:58.020]  The Obama Deception.
[02:21:58.420 --> 02:21:59.680]  The people strike back.
[02:22:01.220 --> 02:22:07.402]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:07.890 --> 02:22:15.673]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:16.013 --> 02:22:23.877]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:24.177 --> 02:22:28.939]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:29.259 --> 02:22:34.002]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:34.483 --> 02:22:38.345]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:38.845 --> 02:22:39.846]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:39.926 --> 02:22:44.029]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[02:22:49.332 --> 02:22:51.894]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[02:23:01.158 --> 02:23:06.620]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:23:06.660 --> 02:23:07.180]  and the world.
[02:23:07.460 --> 02:23:10.901]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:23:11.301 --> 02:23:17.544]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:23:17.804 --> 02:23:19.604]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:23:19.844 --> 02:23:27.787]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.

[02:23:38.573 --> 02:23:40.594]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.

[02:24:40.918 --> 02:24:41.598]  Better off dead.
[02:24:41.618 --> 02:24:43.960]  That's what population sustainability is about.
[02:24:44.900 --> 02:24:49.343]  And, uh, you know, I don't like it any more than anybody else does, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to report on it.
[02:24:49.703 --> 02:24:55.707]  We're joined by Chris Pinto, who is the writer and director of the Secret Mysteries of America's Beginning series.
[02:24:55.767 --> 02:24:59.370]  That's The New Atlantis, Riddles in Stone, and of course the latest,
[02:25:00.030 --> 02:25:15.767]  I have the Phoenix secrets of the dollar bill you get all three of them right now at the Info Warshop for the bargain price of $59.95 when you get two you get one free and like I said this these movies are each well over two hours they cover I mean this interview we're not going to be able to cover one-tenth of the information
[02:25:17.728 --> 02:25:20.410]  What's really great about these films is that you go to the Theosophic Society.
[02:25:20.430 --> 02:25:21.971]  You get information from the horse's mouth.
[02:25:21.991 --> 02:25:24.432]  You talk to high level masons on camera and they reveal so many telling things.
[02:25:35.759 --> 02:25:53.210]  One of the most haunting images for me in the entire series is when you are explaining the Stone of Destiny and Nicholas Rorick and the gentleman who's at the Theosophic Society shows you the little bust of Nicholas Rorick, I think it's a copper bust or something like that, and he starts rubbing the box.
[02:25:54.031 --> 02:26:01.456]  I mean, the look on his face and the way that he's rubbing this box that Nicholas Rorick is supposedly holding of the Stone of Destiny is just so
[02:26:02.336 --> 02:26:02.656]  Eerie.
[02:26:03.077 --> 02:26:04.438]  I mean, was that kind of the goal?
[02:26:04.478 --> 02:26:07.120]  To go get the information from the horse's mouth?
[02:26:07.140 --> 02:26:08.661]  To go to the Theosophic Society?
[02:26:08.681 --> 02:26:14.045]  To go to those people that would talk, you know, positively about people like Manly P. Hall?
[02:26:14.445 --> 02:26:17.147]  And people like, who wrote Morals and Dogma?
[02:26:17.168 --> 02:26:18.288]  Why can't I think of his name?
[02:26:19.689 --> 02:26:21.251]  Who wrote Morals and Dogma?
[02:26:21.291 --> 02:26:22.552]  He's big time in the series.
[02:26:23.399 --> 02:26:25.301]  Albert Pike, that's right.
[02:26:25.361 --> 02:26:26.002]  Boss of Pike.
[02:26:26.342 --> 02:26:35.771]  I mean, you do such a great job of, again, getting the opinions of those who are in favor of this stuff, who love Nicholas Rorick, who love to be Masons.
[02:26:36.031 --> 02:26:38.374]  I mean, was that the goal, to get it right from the source?
[02:26:39.595 --> 02:26:40.195]  Absolutely.
[02:26:40.235 --> 02:26:44.760]  That was our intent, you know, as we began with Volume 1.
[02:26:46.768 --> 02:26:54.191]  There's a lot of books, you know, a lot of literature out there talking about these issues, talking about Freemasonry and the secret societies and so on.
[02:26:54.831 --> 02:27:00.053]  And what I was really hoping we'd be able to do is to talk to as many of these people as possible.
[02:27:00.673 --> 02:27:05.414]  And we created, you know, a history channel type format for the series.
[02:27:06.355 --> 02:27:10.716]  And we told these guys, you know, we let them know in advance what we were going to ask them about.
[02:27:11.336 --> 02:27:13.457]  So we didn't go in and sneak up on them.
[02:27:13.497 --> 02:27:15.938]  I would send everybody their questions in advance.
[02:27:16.768 --> 02:27:28.051]  And these are guys who often speak out against conspiracy theorists and people like yourself and Alex Jones and guys like me and whatnot.
[02:27:28.131 --> 02:27:32.453]  And so, you know, our approach to them was, hey, listen, we want to hear your side of the story.
[02:27:32.673 --> 02:27:35.734]  Just, you know, these are the questions I'm going to ask you.
[02:27:35.894 --> 02:27:40.395]  And you, you know, you tell me what's the what's the right understanding of these things.
[02:27:40.988 --> 02:27:43.990]  And so the interviews were very casual.
[02:27:44.031 --> 02:27:45.692]  I tried to keep them very relaxed.
[02:27:45.812 --> 02:27:50.576]  There was no, you know, hostile, trying to put them in an awkward position.
[02:27:51.016 --> 02:27:53.298]  I just asked them the questions and then let them talk.
[02:27:54.038 --> 02:28:06.128]  And I guess because they were relaxed, they were willing to come out with and reveal, I think, a lot of information that they would have been much more guarded about otherwise.
[02:28:06.588 --> 02:28:09.831]  And at least that's what we're told from others who see the series.
[02:28:10.379 --> 02:28:23.284]  But that guy, Dr. Obadiah Harris at Manly Hall's Society and Library, who's rubbing the statue of Nicholas Roerich, he's a particularly creepy guy.
[02:28:23.304 --> 02:28:28.366]  He's the guy who says that democracy has an occult promise.
[02:28:29.126 --> 02:28:29.646]  Uh, to it.
[02:28:30.246 --> 02:28:33.587]  And you, you see, you know, you and I, we grew up in America.
[02:28:33.647 --> 02:28:36.188]  Most Americans grew up with the idea of democracy.
[02:28:36.548 --> 02:28:42.589]  And we're just thinking of it, you know, you, you, you vote on issues and it's the will of the people and that kind of thing.
[02:28:43.190 --> 02:28:45.010]  And it's just American freedom.
[02:28:45.550 --> 02:28:56.973]  To the occult societies, democracy, the idea of self-government, uh, is, it takes on a whole different meaning.
[02:28:57.862 --> 02:29:09.127]  And it has just a very bizarre, very mystical meaning, and it's about the idea of humanity really ascending into Godhood.
[02:29:09.807 --> 02:29:16.850]  And they look forward to a central figure, whether they call him the Maitreya, the Christ,
[02:29:17.623 --> 02:29:43.832]  the you know the world teacher uh... a central figure like a this is why there's so much worship of barack obama because they're looking for somebody like this who will step forward onto the world stage and lead mankind into this glorious golden era uh... but this man there you know that they're anticipating they believe that he is a god and on the other side we're going to get into that matreya it's the alex jones show we'll be back after this
[02:29:51.860 --> 02:29:54.881]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.782 --> 02:29:58.643]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:07.127 --> 02:30:08.348]  Health Lesson 101.
[02:30:08.788 --> 02:30:10.949]  Swine flu is the topic of news.
[02:30:11.609 --> 02:30:15.611]  Fear and panic seems to be at the top of our emotions.
[02:30:17.136 --> 02:30:21.842]  If your colon is cleansed of toxins, you are less susceptible to any flu virus.
[02:30:22.443 --> 02:30:26.428]  Viruses love unhealthy bodies and attack our system to make us sick.
[02:30:26.668 --> 02:30:28.691]  So get prepared before the attack.
[02:30:29.011 --> 02:30:29.952]  Drink your way to health.

[02:30:33.296 --> 02:30:33.917]  That's Get.
[02:30:34.318 --> 02:30:34.578]  The.
[02:30:34.818 --> 02:30:35.039]  Tea.
[02:30:35.902 --> 02:30:37.983]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[02:31:05.262 --> 02:31:07.384]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:31:07.884 --> 02:31:14.889]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:31:15.469 --> 02:31:21.614]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:31:22.057 --> 02:31:23.878]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:31:24.018 --> 02:31:26.440]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:31:26.520 --> 02:31:37.488]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:31:38.108 --> 02:31:39.389]  It's not about left or right.
[02:31:39.789 --> 02:31:41.150]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:31:41.651 --> 02:31:47.875]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:31:56.817 --> 02:31:57.959]  The Obama Deception.
[02:31:58.380 --> 02:31:59.582]  The people strike back!
[02:32:02.808 --> 02:32:03.688]  Spring is here.
[02:32:03.928 --> 02:32:04.729]  Growing season.
[02:32:04.909 --> 02:32:06.889]  The economy is not getting any better.
[02:32:07.089 --> 02:32:08.490]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[02:32:08.810 --> 02:32:09.470]  Think about it.
[02:32:09.770 --> 02:32:13.632]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[02:32:13.872 --> 02:32:17.353]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[02:32:17.553 --> 02:32:20.114]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[02:32:20.394 --> 02:32:32.258]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[02:32:32.498 --> 02:32:32.938]  I think so.
[02:33:13.566 --> 02:33:20.129]  We are back.
[02:33:20.569 --> 02:33:25.592]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:25.672 --> 02:33:27.253]  I'm Jason Burmas, sitting in.
[02:33:27.813 --> 02:33:32.836]  And before we go back to Chris Pinto, I want to thank another one of our great sponsors, Pepperspray.com.
[02:33:32.876 --> 02:33:34.297]  That's Pepperspray.com.
[02:33:34.337 --> 02:33:35.097]  The call line is 1-800-908-9988.
[02:33:35.137 --> 02:33:35.357]  That's 1-800-908-9988.
[02:33:40.660 --> 02:33:48.203]  And you can not only get pepper spray to defend yourself here, you can get stun guns, tasers, animal repellents, home safety, personal alarms.
[02:33:48.523 --> 02:33:50.823]  And you know, we just ran that story last night.
[02:33:50.863 --> 02:33:52.884]  I don't know if we talked about it on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:52.924 --> 02:33:55.465]  College student shoots, kills home invader.
[02:33:55.985 --> 02:33:59.166]  These people went into the house, they separated ten different people.
[02:33:59.506 --> 02:34:01.247]  Women on one side, guys on the other.
[02:34:01.967 --> 02:34:04.648]  They overheard him saying, hey, do you have enough bullets?
[02:34:04.668 --> 02:34:06.028]  And he's like, yeah, I have enough.
[02:34:06.308 --> 02:34:07.589]  Luckily someone was armed.
[02:34:08.109 --> 02:34:10.790]  Got his gun, shot and killed one of the perpetrators.
[02:34:10.830 --> 02:34:11.870]  The other people ran away.
[02:34:11.910 --> 02:34:13.370]  They're now being detained by police.
[02:34:13.731 --> 02:34:17.091]  But arming yourself is a way to protect yourself.
[02:34:17.131 --> 02:34:32.116]  And if you live in a state like New York, like I do, you know, I'm out in Texas now, but I still have my place in New York, where it is almost an impossibility, let me repeat that, almost an impossibility to get a carry and conceal permit, please think about getting a stun gun, a taser, pepper spray.
[02:34:32.376 --> 02:34:34.616]  Pepperspray.com is the website.
[02:34:34.636 --> 02:34:34.696]  1-800-908-9988.
[02:34:38.577 --> 02:34:47.761]  Alright, that last segue, talking about this Maitreya figure, is really where I wanted to go into this interview, because the Maitreya figure is, I mean, it looks like a Buddha.
[02:34:47.902 --> 02:34:55.365]  Some people are saying this is the new Christ, this is going to be the Antichrist, you touch upon it in Riddles in Stone at the end saying, you know,
[02:34:55.825 --> 02:35:01.508]  Some people believe it's going to be coming very shortly and then really hit it out of the ballpark in Eye of the Phoenix.
[02:35:01.728 --> 02:35:09.893]  Why don't you just give a brief synopsis of what this means and what the people who believe in this stuff think this betrayal will bring to them?
[02:35:11.312 --> 02:35:16.236]  Well, a lot of it begins, well it goes back, they would tell you that it goes back thousands of years.
[02:35:16.677 --> 02:35:20.200]  It really comes into Western culture through Madame H.P.
[02:35:20.220 --> 02:35:23.603]  Blavatsky, who was the founder of the Theosophical Society.
[02:35:24.083 --> 02:35:30.068]  And we talk about her, a lot of people don't realize how many people, prominent people, were Theosophists.
[02:35:30.949 --> 02:35:38.656]  Henry Wallace, who was the Vice President under FDR, Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India.
[02:35:39.376 --> 02:36:02.314]  Thomas Edison and a whole host of others were members of the whole Theosophical Movement, where Madame Blavatsky is literally promoting, through her writings, she's promoting Lucifer, the Archangel Lucifer, as the true God, and claiming that the God of the Bible, the God of Judeo-Christianity, is a false god and really a devil, in short.
[02:36:02.867 --> 02:36:08.134]  But, um, but she is the one who writes about this Maitreya figure.
[02:36:08.194 --> 02:36:20.551]  She calls him the fifth Buddha, the fifth incarnation of Gitano Buddha, and that he would be the final messiah that would come into the world and lead mankind in this glorious golden era.
[02:36:21.432 --> 02:36:26.636]  That's a short, brief explanation of what the Maitreya is.
[02:36:27.376 --> 02:36:35.842]  And, of course, we talk about it in Riddles in Stone, in the second part, because the architecture of Washington, D.C., that's what Riddles is about.
[02:36:36.322 --> 02:36:37.503]  The architecture of D.C.
[02:36:37.563 --> 02:36:45.608]  is all engineered to promote the occult doctrine that man is ultimately his own god, and that man ascends into godhood.
[02:36:46.498 --> 02:36:48.359]  By degrees, by his own power.
[02:36:48.900 --> 02:36:50.801]  And that's what the Maitreya represents.
[02:36:51.501 --> 02:37:08.731]  And the sort of the guy who calls himself the John the Baptist for the Maitreya is this guy Benjamin Krem, who came out 20 some odd years ago and made a declaration in Los Angeles that the Maitreya was getting ready to, the Christ is here.
[02:37:08.811 --> 02:37:10.852]  He took out full-page ads and
[02:37:11.172 --> 02:37:11.552]  I don't know.
[02:37:26.681 --> 02:37:28.322]  He speaks at the United Nations.
[02:37:28.903 --> 02:37:35.947]  He speaks to these political and pseudo-political groups around the world, and he's been doing it for decades.
[02:37:36.668 --> 02:37:46.914]  In fact, we got a brief interview with him in Los Angeles back in 2006, and he had just come from speaking to an NGO group in the United Nations.
[02:37:47.775 --> 02:37:51.137]  And he, in fact, right after Barack Obama,
[02:37:51.818 --> 02:37:53.378]  was elected president.
[02:37:53.799 --> 02:38:06.982]  Share International, which is his organization, gave a press release saying that there were going to be spectacular things happening in the following year and that the Maitreya was going to emerge at some point, or so they believe.
[02:38:08.382 --> 02:38:15.204]  But this was a central doctrine surrounding FDR's administration.
[02:38:16.404 --> 02:38:18.625]  Henry Wallace and then Nicholas Roerich
[02:38:19.113 --> 02:38:26.960]  Who was this Russian guru, this mystic character, who was also a member of Blavatsky's Theosophical Society.
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:28.822]  And a total globalist, by the way.
[02:38:28.882 --> 02:38:34.307]  I mean, this guy was all about globalism, and didn't he help bring in some of these different organizations?
[02:38:35.326 --> 02:38:49.035]  Oh sure, he helped with the founding of the League of Nations and he's given credit for the League was dissolved because of World War II and then he's credited with the formation of the United Nations afterwards.
[02:38:50.536 --> 02:38:54.058]  And in fact there was this whole Rorik peace pact that was signed.
[02:38:54.531 --> 02:38:57.614]  In the White House by Henry Wallace with FDR and so on.
[02:38:58.234 --> 02:39:06.300]  He was a very influential political figure, nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and so on.
[02:39:06.801 --> 02:39:15.688]  He was lauded by political leaders around the world, especially in Tibet and the Eastern countries and so on.
[02:39:16.048 --> 02:39:17.790]  There they celebrated him openly.
[02:39:18.270 --> 02:39:23.134]  And if you see his paintings, and we go to the Rourke Museum in New York and we show all of his paintings,
[02:39:23.655 --> 02:39:28.439]  His paintings are all promoting, you know, globalist ideas.
[02:39:28.819 --> 02:39:33.803]  Ideas of unifying all the world religions, unifying all the countries of the world.
[02:39:34.984 --> 02:39:49.215]  And he was specifically working through the White House now, when he went abroad, toward creating or helping to create the Asian Union that we're seeing, you know, come about now.
[02:39:49.235 --> 02:39:52.758]  But he was part of the whole groundworking of that movement.
[02:39:53.314 --> 02:39:54.735]  Uh, during FDR's era.
[02:39:55.456 --> 02:39:58.499]  So, he's promoting this idea of the Matreya.
[02:39:58.539 --> 02:40:11.330]  When they built his building, called the Master Building in New York, they laid the cornerstone and they put in there a piece of what he was calling the Stone of Destiny with an image of the Matreya.
[02:40:12.231 --> 02:40:15.534]  They put an image of the Matreya inside this cornerstone.
[02:40:16.786 --> 02:40:22.227]  And what's really bizarre about this, Jason, this wasn't just an event where they laid the cornerstone.
[02:40:22.547 --> 02:40:25.028]  They had dignitaries come from around the world.
[02:40:25.488 --> 02:40:30.829]  From Argentina, from Spain, from Romania, from all over the world.
[02:40:30.969 --> 02:40:33.070]  Albert Einstein sends a tribute.
[02:40:33.510 --> 02:40:34.890]  Henry Wallace is there.
[02:40:34.910 --> 02:40:38.351]  I mean, it's this major event in 1929, right before
[02:40:40.498 --> 02:40:42.259]  Right before the stock market crash.
[02:40:43.479 --> 02:40:46.660]  But it was a very different environment in America.
[02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:51.442]  And it was a very mystical environment surrounding the sky rock.
[02:40:52.302 --> 02:40:54.483]  And they're all coming to see this Maitreya.
[02:40:54.543 --> 02:41:03.286]  So when you sent me these images of the Maitreya and the Bohemian Grove, I thought, oh my gosh, this really ties it all together.
[02:41:03.686 --> 02:41:05.606]  But this is the central theme for
[02:41:07.594 --> 02:41:13.136]  You know, for these secret occult groups that are manipulating our world political system.
[02:41:13.796 --> 02:41:25.341]  But they're doing it because they ultimately believe that all of their efforts are going to mystically, magically compel this person, whoever he will be, to come into the world.
[02:41:25.981 --> 02:41:32.063]  You know, now if you're a Christian as I am, then you believe this figure is the Antichrist prophesied in the Bible.
[02:41:32.964 --> 02:41:36.125]  You know, the false messiah that's going to become the one world ruler.
[02:41:36.998 --> 02:41:47.026]  Uh, but there are, I mean there are these groups and they have links that go to the most powerful offices in the world who are really trying to bring this to pass.
[02:41:47.947 --> 02:41:53.551]  Uh, and they're involved, as you described earlier, in these occult rituals, these satanic, you know,
[02:41:54.369 --> 02:42:06.919]  Sure, but just the fact that we're just now discussing that there's a Maitreya figure there when obviously these photographs have been out there and you know mainstream media totally ignores the subject and really the alternative media only
[02:42:18.767 --> 02:42:22.969]  It seems like this is a different section of the grove.
[02:42:23.029 --> 02:42:25.270]  It seems like a different ritual goes on here.
[02:42:25.311 --> 02:42:31.093]  And it seems like, you know, again, the elite are looking at this figure as, like you said, this coming Christ figure.
[02:42:31.353 --> 02:42:35.155]  What I don't understand is, where does it fit into Buddhism?
[02:42:35.175 --> 02:42:37.336]  Where does this Maitreya fit into Buddhism?
[02:42:37.376 --> 02:42:38.397]  Why are they the same?
[02:42:39.237 --> 02:42:40.838]  Why are they represented by the same figure?
[02:42:42.628 --> 02:42:49.392]  Well, my understanding of it is, and it gets very complicated, even if you listen to them explain it.
[02:42:49.853 --> 02:42:55.036]  And then when you ask them questions, the ones who believe all of this, they themselves get confused.
[02:42:55.596 --> 02:43:01.580]  But the Maitreya is supposed to be the fifth incarnation of the original Buddha.
[02:43:02.395 --> 02:43:13.341]  That he has supposedly five incarnations, Kitano Buddha was his name, and he claimed that he would have a fifth incarnation, and that would be his final incarnation.
[02:43:14.142 --> 02:43:23.086]  And so they have, throughout Eastern mysticism, they have believed that this would be, that
[02:43:24.597 --> 02:43:39.361]  That Jesus and, you know, Muhammad and Krishna and all of these different figures, they believe that they all were inspired by what they call the Christ principle, or the Christ spirit, or Christ consciousness.
[02:43:40.061 --> 02:43:42.182]  Okay, that they themselves were not Christ.
[02:43:42.642 --> 02:43:45.443]  They don't believe that Jesus is the Christ.
[02:43:45.543 --> 02:43:49.384]  They believe that he was just somebody who was inspired by this energy.
[02:43:50.089 --> 02:43:55.100]  But that the real Christ figure is the Buddha, is Maitreya Buddha.
[02:43:55.861 --> 02:44:01.012]  And that he will ultimately, when he comes into the world, he'll be a global messiah.
[02:44:01.970 --> 02:44:02.151]  I don't
[02:44:21.670 --> 02:44:30.133]  Is that those who are in the upper echelons of power, the true elite, they are religious and their religion is this occult religion.
[02:44:30.173 --> 02:44:34.115]  And like you said, they do believe of the coming of this Maitreya figure.
[02:44:34.395 --> 02:44:35.475]  I mean, how can we get around that?
[02:44:35.515 --> 02:44:49.341]  How can we relate to people that, hey, even if you're not religious, even if you're secular, you don't subscribe to Christianity or Buddhism or you're not a Muslim or a Jew, you know, how do we get to those people that this is what they believe?
[02:44:50.705 --> 02:44:52.267]  Yeah, that's a tough one.
[02:44:52.327 --> 02:45:05.518]  One of the arguments that I make is I try to explain to people that the whole doctrine, the idea of a separation of church and state, people hear that and they think it means removing religion from government.
[02:45:05.878 --> 02:45:07.119]  And that's not what it means.
[02:45:07.419 --> 02:45:09.541]  What it means, if you study these societies,
[02:45:10.077 --> 02:45:12.578]  It means removing the church, i.e.
[02:45:12.678 --> 02:45:13.619]  Christianity.
[02:45:14.219 --> 02:45:17.420]  Getting Christianity out of American government.
[02:45:17.801 --> 02:45:24.584]  But they want, like when you go into Washington, D.C., and you're seeing all of these god and goddess images, and so on.
[02:45:25.124 --> 02:45:27.725]  I mean, these are all religious symbols.
[02:45:28.466 --> 02:45:31.947]  Including the goddess Persephone, which is on the top of the Capitol building.
[02:45:31.967 --> 02:45:33.428]  A lot of people don't even realize that!
[02:45:34.184 --> 02:45:34.504]  Right!
[02:45:35.285 --> 02:45:38.906]  You go out in front of the courthouse, they have this big deal in front of courthouses, right?
[02:45:38.946 --> 02:45:41.468]  Getting rid of the Ten Commandments in front of the courthouse.
[02:45:41.968 --> 02:45:48.871]  But right next to the Ten Commandments, they have a statue of Themis, the blindfolded goddess holding the scales.
[02:45:49.512 --> 02:45:51.473]  That's the ancient goddess of justice.
[02:45:52.313 --> 02:45:54.834]  But nobody ever says anything about getting rid of her.
[02:45:54.894 --> 02:46:00.517]  The ACLU is not leading a crusade to get rid of all the religious iconography.
[02:46:01.013 --> 02:46:08.714]  They're just trying to get rid of Christianity, or Judeo-Christianity, biblical values and teachings and so on.
[02:46:09.094 --> 02:46:12.855]  But all of the pagan stuff can remain.
[02:46:12.875 --> 02:46:25.717]  You know, the all-seeing eye stays on the dollar bill, the Washington Monument's not going anywhere, nobody's ever threatened the Statue of Liberty, even though Lady Liberty is based upon the Babylonian mother goddess of the ancient world.
[02:46:26.838 --> 02:46:28.438]  All of these are religious icons.
[02:46:29.071 --> 02:46:45.420]  And what they're doing is they're supplanting, they're getting rid of, just as they got rid of the teaching of creation in our schools, and then they put in this ancient Hindu belief about reincarnation, but they call it evolution, right?
[02:46:45.520 --> 02:46:49.202]  And they call it a science, and now that's what they're teaching in our schools.
[02:46:50.295 --> 02:46:54.957]  But evolutionary teaching doesn't have any scientific basis to it, if you study it.
[02:46:55.577 --> 02:47:09.163]  It's all based in the ancient Hindu, eastern mystical view about how, you know, man begins as a tadpole or something, comes back as a frog, comes back as a goat, a dog, etc., and so on.
[02:47:09.563 --> 02:47:13.424]  And he's continually evolving upward toward godhood.
[02:47:14.025 --> 02:47:16.466]  That's where all of this stuff goes.
[02:47:17.326 --> 02:47:19.587]  And it is really what they believe.
[02:47:20.570 --> 02:47:24.951]  Uh, and they believe this is the true religion of the universe, as it were.
[02:47:25.831 --> 02:47:29.152]  And that anything that you're taught in the Bible is a counterfeit.
[02:47:30.053 --> 02:47:34.494]  Uh, or that it's been misunderstood by Christianity, as it were.
[02:47:34.834 --> 02:47:37.235]  So, that's the real enemy for them.
[02:47:38.275 --> 02:47:39.555]  Uh, and... Go ahead.
[02:47:40.655 --> 02:47:46.057]  No, I was gonna say, you know, one of the things, just to support something that you guys talk a lot about, the idea of
[02:47:46.727 --> 02:47:50.949]  You know, Alex Jones says it's not about left or right, and I couldn't agree more.
[02:47:51.829 --> 02:48:02.295]  One of the things that I often tell people, say about George Bush, who presents himself as a Christian, and then he goes off and he's bowing down to this owl god out there in the Bohemian Grove.
[02:48:03.375 --> 02:48:13.520]  If the left-wing media really hated Bush, if they hated Bush and they wanted to stop him from becoming president, all they would have had to do is just run a week-long story
[02:48:14.019 --> 02:48:26.883]  On the Bohemian Grove, the Bush family is a part of it, they're bowing down to Buddhas and this 40-foot owl god of Molech, and there's no way evangelical Christians would have ever voted for George Bush.
[02:48:27.624 --> 02:48:29.024]  They would have never voted for him.
[02:48:30.067 --> 02:48:31.128]  I don't think so.
[02:48:46.739 --> 02:49:02.968]  I feel bad for my fellow Christians in America, because I feel like they're often the ones who are being lied to and manipulated, because Christianity is, you know, 80% of the people in our country profess some form of Christianity.
[02:49:03.684 --> 02:49:09.106]  And so they often use Christianity and churches and so on to manipulate this agenda.
[02:49:09.626 --> 02:49:24.730]  And a lot of what we're trying to do through the Secret Mysteries series, which is why we talk about how, yes, Christians did come here in the beginning, you know, with the Puritan Pilgrim Movement, but there were with them these secret groups, and as Manley Hall says, they
[02:49:25.726 --> 02:49:37.634]  Reclose their pagan ideas in this garment of Christian phraseology, but the reason was so that they could manipulate the Christian population to carry out their secret agenda.
[02:49:38.514 --> 02:49:40.275]  That's what they've been doing for 200 years now.
[02:49:41.792 --> 02:49:42.593]  What's next for you?
[02:49:59.674 --> 02:50:01.295]  No difference between the left and right.
[02:50:01.315 --> 02:50:04.535]  They don't understand that their leaders are really into the occult.
[02:50:04.776 --> 02:50:12.538]  You know, they don't have this broad overview of what you present, so I think it's a great eye-opener if I can actually get them to throw it into the DVD player.
[02:50:12.878 --> 02:50:14.919]  What's next for Chris Pinto and David Bay?
[02:50:16.359 --> 02:50:26.282]  Well, for myself and David, we're doing our pre-production stuff for Secret Mysteries Part 4, which is the working title is War of the World.
[02:50:27.120 --> 02:50:38.384]  And it takes this whole America series and how America is really being used by these secret groups to carry out the New World Order.
[02:50:39.065 --> 02:50:39.925]  Excellent, excellent.
[02:50:39.945 --> 02:50:40.465]  We'll come back.
[02:50:40.485 --> 02:50:42.186]  We're going to talk about that more on the other side.
[02:50:42.226 --> 02:50:43.246]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:43.566 --> 02:50:44.367]  I'm Jason Bermas.

[02:53:04.709 --> 02:53:09.952]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:53:10.232 --> 02:53:15.575]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:53:15.956 --> 02:53:17.076]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:53:17.437 --> 02:53:26.342]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:53:26.742 --> 02:53:28.384]  Now compare a cowbend pure soap.

[02:53:55.306 --> 02:53:56.247]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[02:54:18.777 --> 02:54:37.750]  Folks, here I am wearing my Bohemian Grove Trapski hat that somebody sent us and next to me is the anvil from 1987 to 1996 and if we zoom in on that we had a caller yesterday Chris that was questioning how could Alex Jones possibly get into the Bohemian Grove and he was
[02:54:38.050 --> 02:54:42.073]  Insinuating that Alex was a member and it was all a conspiracy and blah blah blah.
[02:54:42.413 --> 02:54:48.516]  The truth is in the early 80s they did do some mainline reporting on the Bohemian Grove and we have those clips.
[02:54:48.717 --> 02:54:54.220]  They're going to be in my next film, Invisible Empire, which really goes over this globalist New World Order agenda.
[02:54:54.280 --> 02:54:57.662]  Tom Brokaw talking about it, ABC News talking about it.
[02:54:57.902 --> 02:55:02.325]  But in the annal, I want to just show this on theprisonplanet.tv really,
[02:55:02.785 --> 02:55:05.486]  Quick, and we'll zoom out from it to see what other characters are here.
[02:55:05.806 --> 02:55:09.046]  But you have a news reporter sitting here, and he's also a cartoonist.
[02:55:09.507 --> 02:55:14.568]  And he's drawing a picture, and if you miss this, if you're listening, go check it out on YouTube later.
[02:55:15.268 --> 02:55:21.609]  He's drawing, he's pretending he's doing the news, but there's the thought bubble behind him, and he's in a robe, and he has a candle.
[02:55:21.649 --> 02:55:23.350]  He's a member of the Bohemian Grove.
[02:55:23.630 --> 02:55:25.730]  And he's basically talking to everybody.
[02:55:25.770 --> 02:55:28.571]  Zoom out a little further, and let's see who our good friends are above him.
[02:55:29.471 --> 02:55:36.876]  Oh, look, it's Newt Gingrich and George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush, the very good Christian men.
[02:55:37.877 --> 02:55:38.958]  Unbelievable.
[02:55:39.338 --> 02:55:49.605]  You know, what do you say to those kind of critics that, you know, they think that everything's a conspiracy, they think because Alex was able to get into the Bohemian Grove he must be a member or a Vatican assassin?
[02:55:49.945 --> 02:55:56.890]  I mean, to me it's just ludicrous, but to the outsider looking in, how do you explain to him, how do you explain to them that's not what happened?
[02:55:58.464 --> 02:56:02.586]  Well, I would, you know, we've dealt with some of those people as well.
[02:56:02.606 --> 02:56:13.753]  We had a woman call and accuse us of being controlled by radical Muslims and left a message on our machine because in our documentaries we hadn't mentioned Islam or something.
[02:56:14.133 --> 02:56:15.654]  I mean, some people do.
[02:56:16.354 --> 02:56:26.020]  I think Alex Jones and you guys, you do a great job because you're very careful to document the things that you're talking about and we try to do the same thing in our films.
[02:56:26.740 --> 02:56:32.124]  Uh, and what ends up happening is you put aside a lot of your conspiracy theories.
[02:56:32.204 --> 02:56:37.448]  If you have a conspiracy theory about something and you go and investigate it, sometimes you're wrong.
[02:56:37.728 --> 02:56:42.592]  You know, sometimes you had an idea about something and it just wasn't the right idea.
[02:56:44.304 --> 02:56:48.228]  But I think that's why I'm so careful to document your evidence.
[02:56:48.288 --> 02:56:54.394]  But those kind of accusations against Alex, I've seen them against my partner, David Bay.
[02:56:54.854 --> 02:57:06.145]  He's been openly accused of being a member of the Illuminati because we mentioned Sir Francis Bacon and there was this whole conspiracy theory that went on about that.
[02:57:06.998 --> 02:57:09.220]  I think it just kind of comes with the territory.
[02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:16.465]  And so we encourage people to be, you know, to be careful, to prove all things, as the Bible says.
[02:57:16.505 --> 02:57:19.447]  You know, we're Christians and we admonish people.
[02:57:19.507 --> 02:57:22.029]  The Bible also says, accuse no man falsely.
[02:57:22.569 --> 02:57:27.873]  So we try to refrain from that and just encourage people to seek the truth.
[02:57:27.953 --> 02:57:35.499]  And we try to present as much documentation as possible to convict people so that they would go and conduct their own investigation.
[02:57:36.139 --> 02:57:36.620]  Exactly.
[02:57:36.660 --> 02:57:39.202]  The proof is in the pudding and we put this stuff out there.
[02:57:39.242 --> 02:57:42.265]  We source it and we hope that people check out our source material.
[02:57:42.305 --> 02:57:43.125]  That's what this is about.
[02:57:43.326 --> 02:57:54.976]  When you talk about the pentagram in Riddles in Stone that's inlaid in the DC architecture, of course with the open segment, you explain this is a Faustian process and out of one of his plays, correct?
[02:57:56.076 --> 02:58:15.411]  Absolutely, and we show that it's mentioned by a very high-ranking nation, Goethe, the famous German writer, in Faust, and he's publishing this broken pentagram in Faust during the same time period that Pierre L'Enfant is doing the street design for Washington, D.C.
[02:58:16.252 --> 02:58:17.952]  Chris, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:58:18.373 --> 02:58:26.315]  The series is Secret Mysteries of America's Beginning, The New Atlantis, Riddles in Stone, Eye of the Phoenix, and look out for Part 4, hopefully in the coming months.
[02:58:26.335 --> 02:58:30.196]  They're in pre-production now, but I'm sure it's going to be another bang-up video.
[02:58:30.376 --> 02:58:31.376]  We'll be back after this.
[02:58:31.416 --> 02:58:32.877]  We've got Alan Watt for the full hour.
[02:58:32.897 --> 02:58:35.157]  We're going to be taking your calls in the second half hour.
[02:58:35.237 --> 02:58:36.157]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:58:36.237 --> 02:58:39.258]  I'm Jason Bermas, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[02:58:43.820 --> 02:58:44.980]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.308 --> 02:58:48.710]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.491 --> 02:58:53.073]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.193 --> 02:58:57.796]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.936 --> 02:59:00.678]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.898 --> 02:59:03.760]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.940 --> 02:59:09.824]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:59:10.024 --> 02:59:12.906]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.246 --> 02:59:20.151]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:20.232 --> 02:59:23.354]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:59:23.514 --> 02:59:23.714]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:23.774 --> 02:59:25.055]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:28.658 --> 02:59:34.740]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-stride, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:59:34.920 --> 02:59:42.062]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:42.083 --> 02:59:46.084]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:59:46.284 --> 02:59:47.264]  Take action today.
[02:59:47.424 --> 02:59:49.185]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.201 --> 02:59:56.122]  Waging War on Corruption!
[02:59:56.603 --> 02:59:59.385]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network!
[03:00:14.506 --> 03:00:15.987]  All right, folks, we are back.
[03:00:16.027 --> 03:00:18.107]  It's the final hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:18.127 --> 03:00:19.308]  I'm Jason Burmiss, sitting in.
[03:00:19.668 --> 03:00:22.289]  We're going to have Alan Watt come up after the break.
[03:00:22.449 --> 03:00:23.589]  We're going to take your phone calls.
[03:00:23.649 --> 03:00:29.011]  I know a lot of people have been patiently waiting at the 30 aftermark for Alan and myself.
[03:00:29.491 --> 03:00:33.653]  But I want to take this opportunity to thank another one of our great sponsors, Acola Blue.
[03:00:34.173 --> 03:00:41.699]  It's a Ecolablue.com E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com and Ecolablue is just this awesome machine that literally takes
[03:00:42.935 --> 03:00:50.421]  The air and creates water and it has a reverse osmosis process, all sorts of filters.
[03:00:50.441 --> 03:00:51.122]  1-800-691-6043.
[03:00:51.382 --> 03:00:52.843]  It's 1-800-691-6043.
[03:00:53.284 --> 03:00:56.086]  It is delicious.
[03:00:56.166 --> 03:00:57.367]  It's the water I drink here.
[03:00:57.527 --> 03:00:58.268]  It keeps it cool.
[03:00:58.308 --> 03:00:59.029]  You can get it hot.
[03:00:59.129 --> 03:01:00.930]  I mean, it's the coolest machine ever.
[03:01:01.210 --> 03:01:02.652]  acolablue.com.
[03:01:03.012 --> 03:01:04.553]  Know what you're drinking.
[03:01:04.573 --> 03:01:06.395]  1-800-691-6043.
[03:01:07.616 --> 03:01:09.798]  All right, we got a few minutes before the break.
[03:01:09.878 --> 03:01:11.079]  I want to play this clip
[03:01:11.619 --> 03:01:18.945]  Of this young girl being arrested for calling 9-1-1 because her father's having a seizure.
[03:01:19.045 --> 03:01:19.786]  How dare she?
[03:01:20.126 --> 03:01:20.787]  Hit it, Jaren.
[03:01:23.869 --> 03:01:24.810]  And we're hitting it.
[03:01:24.830 --> 03:01:29.454]  In Lincoln Park every year, people dial 9-1-1 more than 14,000 times.
[03:01:29.854 --> 03:01:34.778]  And let's make it clear right up front, those emergency calls are generally very well handled.
[03:01:35.119 --> 03:01:38.942]  But that doesn't make what happened to Adrienne Ledesma any less shocking.
[03:01:39.482 --> 03:01:40.263]  That was really scary.
[03:01:41.735 --> 03:01:43.156]  Because, you know, it's my dad.
[03:01:43.176 --> 03:01:44.517]  And he fell.
[03:01:44.537 --> 03:01:46.358]  It was not so far like that.
[03:01:46.499 --> 03:01:51.482]  His fall was so frightening because he was just three weeks out of the hospital where he underwent brain surgery.
[03:01:51.542 --> 03:01:56.186]  And suddenly, he's on the kitchen floor, unconscious and shaking with a severe seizure.
[03:01:56.546 --> 03:01:57.367]  I was scared.
[03:01:58.628 --> 03:01:59.328]  Like, I don't know.
[03:01:59.348 --> 03:02:00.069]  I was freaking out.
[03:02:00.649 --> 03:02:02.970]  So this 17 year old grabbed her phone and dialed 911.
[03:02:04.050 --> 03:02:07.172]  She says she got no quick answers, so hung up and called again.
[03:02:07.712 --> 03:02:13.354]  Now you know those emergency calls are recorded, but did you know the recording starts even before the call is answered?
[03:02:16.795 --> 03:02:23.958]  So you can hear her near panic when again she can't get an immediate answer, blurting out the F word just as the call is picked up.
[03:02:24.974 --> 03:02:25.054]  9-1-1.
[03:02:25.094 --> 03:02:28.616]  I need an ambulance to ****** drive Hartwick.
[03:02:28.957 --> 03:02:33.940]  But the Lincoln Park cop who takes the call admonishes her and only makes her more frantic.
[03:02:34.220 --> 03:02:37.182]  Well, okay, first of all, you don't need to swear over 9-1-1.
[03:02:37.262 --> 03:02:37.622]  Okay.
[03:02:38.343 --> 03:02:39.083]  And slow down.
[03:02:39.383 --> 03:02:39.944]  ****** ambulance!
[03:02:40.984 --> 03:02:43.766]  You haven't had a chance to tell him how serious this is, right?
[03:02:44.567 --> 03:02:45.928]  And he's already hung up the phone.
[03:02:46.988 --> 03:02:48.449]  Well, I thought my dad was going to die.
[03:02:48.469 --> 03:02:49.350]  I was really scared.
[03:02:49.650 --> 03:02:50.370]  So you called back.
[03:02:50.390 --> 03:02:50.430]  9-1-1.
[03:02:52.086 --> 03:02:53.567]  Um, are you going to give me an ambulance?
[03:02:53.647 --> 03:02:55.247]  Are you going to swear again, you stupid b****?
[03:02:55.688 --> 03:02:56.588]  Are we going to have a f****** problem?
[03:02:57.068 --> 03:02:58.349]  No, you're not going to have a f****** problem.
[03:02:58.369 --> 03:02:59.729]  Do you want to f****** lose your job?
[03:03:00.409 --> 03:03:01.470]  Your dad's still on the floor.
[03:03:01.490 --> 03:03:06.272]  Well, I'm thinking he's seriously hurt because he's still having a seizure and it's a really long seizure.
[03:03:06.292 --> 03:03:10.974]  And I'm thinking that I want to, you know, complain about this guy because he shouldn't be hanging up on me.
[03:03:11.374 --> 03:03:13.115]  So she calls back a third time.
[03:03:13.135 --> 03:03:13.775]  9-1-1.
[03:03:13.875 --> 03:03:16.896]  I just want to know what's your name because you're getting sued.
[03:03:17.256 --> 03:03:17.496]  Good.
[03:03:18.217 --> 03:03:18.577]  What is it?
[03:03:18.597 --> 03:03:18.857]  Good.
[03:03:19.437 --> 03:03:21.138]  Good for you because you're a buffoon.
[03:03:22.992 --> 03:03:28.015]  After wasting more than six minutes, the cop finally called the rescue squad.
[03:03:28.115 --> 03:03:32.478]  I kept getting a 9-1-1 call from this filthy mouthed girl that wanted a rescue.
[03:03:32.498 --> 03:03:36.200]  I never found out what it was and I was never able to transfer it over to you.
[03:03:36.460 --> 03:03:41.503]  And that's the same story he told on the police radio when he dispatched a squad car to the house.
[03:03:42.004 --> 03:03:44.045]  I kept getting 9-1-1 calls from this girl.
[03:03:44.585 --> 03:03:46.486]  Hostile girl requesting a rescue.
[03:03:47.147 --> 03:03:48.527]  No idea what it's for.
[03:03:49.388 --> 03:03:50.349]  I couldn't get through her
[03:03:51.570 --> 03:03:53.310]  Alright, let's stop because we're about to go to break.
[03:03:53.350 --> 03:03:54.411]  Couldn't get through her comments.
[03:03:54.451 --> 03:03:55.931]  He hung up on her three times.
[03:03:56.251 --> 03:03:58.252]  She ran to the police station.
[03:03:58.292 --> 03:03:58.632]  Guess what?
[03:03:58.692 --> 03:03:59.832]  She gets arrested.
[03:04:00.292 --> 03:04:03.173]  This guy needs to lose his job.
[03:04:03.313 --> 03:04:03.853]  Let me repeat.
[03:04:03.873 --> 03:04:06.054]  He needs to lose his job.
[03:04:06.194 --> 03:04:08.294]  She's trying to get an ambulance for her father.
[03:04:08.334 --> 03:04:10.595]  You don't hang up on somebody who's calling 911.
[03:04:11.955 --> 03:04:13.135]  One for an ambulance.
[03:04:13.475 --> 03:04:14.916]  Give me a break.
[03:04:15.136 --> 03:04:19.497]  And this just shows how out of control the police officers are, how they're on power trips.
[03:04:19.737 --> 03:04:25.179]  You know, we would have showed another clip, and maybe we'll do so at the end of the show, where people go to protest Scientology.
[03:04:25.379 --> 03:04:27.519]  They don't get within 400 feet of the front door.
[03:04:27.599 --> 03:04:28.419]  They're on the sidewalk.
[03:04:28.579 --> 03:04:32.660]  They immediately throw one of them down, arrest them, and threaten the others with arrest.
[03:04:32.801 --> 03:04:37.382]  It's the new America, and we're going to be discussing that with Alan Watt of CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com.
[03:04:38.622 --> 03:04:40.045]  After this, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:40.105 --> 03:04:47.981]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in my little blog is TheInfoWarrior.com, but go check out all the news at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com right now.
[03:05:01.810 --> 03:05:04.992]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[03:05:05.333 --> 03:05:07.074]  Now, going green can save money.
[03:05:07.254 --> 03:05:12.598]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[03:05:12.818 --> 03:05:20.543]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[03:05:20.843 --> 03:05:30.150]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Vadini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives.
[03:05:30.430 --> 03:05:33.474]  Increasing capacity and maintaining cell integrity.

[03:05:38.841 --> 03:05:44.047]  Find out why our customers tell us the Renaissance Charger is the only battery charger they will ever use.
[03:05:44.367 --> 03:05:45.088]  Save your money.
[03:05:45.489 --> 03:05:46.410]  Save the environment.
[03:05:46.790 --> 03:05:48.171]  Visit us online at r-charge.com.
[03:05:48.211 --> 03:05:49.132]  That's r-charge.com.
[03:05:49.152 --> 03:05:49.773]  Or call us at 989-637-4179.
[03:05:49.793 --> 03:05:50.253]  That's 989-637-4179.
[03:05:50.313 --> 03:05:51.434]  Be a part of the revolution today!
[03:05:51.454 --> 03:05:53.056]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[03:06:05.393 --> 03:06:07.516]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:06:08.016 --> 03:06:15.005]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:06:15.606 --> 03:06:21.754]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:22.194 --> 03:06:24.015]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:24.155 --> 03:06:26.577]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:06:26.657 --> 03:06:37.624]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:06:38.225 --> 03:06:39.525]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:39.906 --> 03:06:41.287]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:06:41.767 --> 03:06:47.991]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:06:48.678 --> 03:06:56.431]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:56.932 --> 03:06:58.094]  The Obama Deception.
[03:06:58.515 --> 03:06:59.717]  The people strike back!
[03:07:01.792 --> 03:07:05.175]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:07:05.315 --> 03:07:10.520]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:07:10.720 --> 03:07:15.484]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:07:15.684 --> 03:07:26.654]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[03:07:26.914 --> 03:07:32.475]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:07:32.676 --> 03:07:38.737]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:07:38.897 --> 03:07:39.537]  What about you?
[03:07:39.757 --> 03:07:44.339]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99, with free shipping.

[03:07:52.762 --> 03:07:55.903]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:14.937 --> 03:08:16.238]  Alright folks, we are back.
[03:08:16.258 --> 03:08:18.198]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:18.218 --> 03:08:21.119]  Before we go to Alan Watt, I want to thank our final sponsor of the day.
[03:08:21.179 --> 03:08:21.979]  It's Home Gain.

[03:08:29.420 --> 03:08:30.621]  They have a nice little feature there.
[03:08:30.641 --> 03:08:32.881]  If you're going to look at a house, they have the street view.
[03:08:33.241 --> 03:08:36.042]  It's kind of like on Google where you can go around the street.
[03:08:36.062 --> 03:08:37.462]  You can see what the neighborhood looks like.
[03:08:37.842 --> 03:08:43.245]  And on top of that, you can just go to HomeGain.com and get a free estimate on your house by simply typing in your address.

[03:08:48.328 --> 03:08:48.708]  Alright.
[03:08:49.108 --> 03:08:53.911]  We are honored to be joined by Alan Watt of CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com.
[03:08:53.951 --> 03:08:54.752]  How are you today, Alan?
[03:08:55.552 --> 03:08:56.172]  Not too bad.
[03:08:56.473 --> 03:08:56.913]  Not too bad.
[03:08:57.577 --> 03:09:05.824]  Well, I want to get your take on this latest DHS document and really just the out-of-control nature of police officers around the country.
[03:09:05.864 --> 03:09:10.248]  We just played that clip where this girl is trying to call 911 for her father.
[03:09:10.568 --> 03:09:12.189]  She uses the naughty F word.
[03:09:12.249 --> 03:09:15.012]  God forbid she uses the F word because she's in a panic.
[03:09:15.232 --> 03:09:18.835]  And she's actually hung up on by these police officers.
[03:09:19.175 --> 03:09:21.017]  Then she goes down four blocks.
[03:09:21.397 --> 03:09:24.359]  Well, we've had gradual indoctrination over 20-odd years, maybe 30, mainly through
[03:09:40.606 --> 03:09:51.390]  Fictional media, entertainment, beginning even with Starsky and Hutch, which was banned in Britain at one time because they eventually started pulling their guns out on everybody they saw on every episode.
[03:09:52.522 --> 03:09:54.022]  But now it's a standard fare.
[03:09:54.062 --> 03:09:55.203]  The cops are the bosses.
[03:09:55.283 --> 03:09:57.403]  They're the authoritarian figures.
[03:09:57.843 --> 03:10:02.124]  And the cops themselves come out of the same society of indoctrination.
[03:10:02.164 --> 03:10:04.445]  So they truly believe that they are authoritarian figures.
[03:10:04.965 --> 03:10:06.586]  And they were supposed to obey them.
[03:10:07.246 --> 03:10:10.066]  They don't get taught that they're there to serve the public anymore.
[03:10:10.326 --> 03:10:12.447]  And they haven't been taught that for an awful long time.
[03:10:13.027 --> 03:10:16.348]  And we've got to remember, too, police are in the business of laying charges.
[03:10:16.848 --> 03:10:17.708]  That's their function.
[03:10:18.809 --> 03:10:20.429]  And if you call the cops for anything,
[03:10:21.767 --> 03:10:22.808]  I think really you're a fool.
[03:10:23.449 --> 03:10:34.057]  Because there's even videos up there with ex-cops who are now these lawyers that went into law stating quite openly that that's their function is to lay charges on people.
[03:10:34.077 --> 03:10:34.817]  They don't care who.
[03:10:35.538 --> 03:10:37.520]  And they actually call on the videos up on Google.
[03:10:37.540 --> 03:10:39.141]  They actually call on the public stupid.
[03:10:39.161 --> 03:10:41.302]  And they explain why they're stupid.
[03:10:41.903 --> 03:10:46.106]  Because the public perception is still the old perception that the cops are there to help them.
[03:10:46.507 --> 03:10:47.788]  Cops are not there to help you.
[03:10:48.088 --> 03:10:50.750]  They're there to get charges laid on anybody.
[03:10:51.795 --> 03:10:52.355]  For anything.
[03:10:52.375 --> 03:10:55.418]  It doesn't matter if you call them and they come into your house just to have a chat.
[03:10:56.258 --> 03:10:58.700]  If they find anything at all they can charge you with, they'll do it.
[03:10:59.040 --> 03:11:01.942]  And we've got to understand that's really what their purpose is.
[03:11:02.903 --> 03:11:09.608]  Alright, well let's shift gears to this latest DHS document, Domestic Extremism Lexicon.
[03:11:09.668 --> 03:11:20.696]  I mean this one, this is the third document from DHS that we've talked about, obviously the fourth if you include the MIAC report, but right out of the gates they say this is for non-Islamic
[03:11:20.996 --> 03:11:31.619]  Extremism in this country and really DHS was built up under the guise that we were going to fight Al-Qaeda and the Taliban and we needed this new agency, but nothing could be further from the truth.
[03:11:31.699 --> 03:11:33.819]  This is for the American public, is it not?
[03:11:33.839 --> 03:11:35.160]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:11:35.420 --> 03:11:35.800]  Absolutely.
[03:11:35.820 --> 03:11:44.202]  But then again, people who still believe that government is there to serve them, once again need to get their head checked because that went out a long time ago.
[03:11:44.904 --> 03:11:51.309]  The government has an agenda, and they'll lie about everything to get a law in the books, which they intend to expand as soon as it's passed.
[03:11:51.869 --> 03:11:54.031]  So, absolutely, that's the whole key.
[03:11:54.431 --> 03:11:58.875]  We're going into a complete new world order, where we will have no rights whatsoever.
[03:11:58.895 --> 03:12:00.616]  They've made that quite plain.
[03:12:01.257 --> 03:12:04.519]  And all they need is our compliance at every stage to accept it.
[03:12:05.240 --> 03:12:08.202]  And then they can bring through the next part, and the next part, and the next part.
[03:12:08.783 --> 03:12:11.865]  There are no rights and freedoms anymore, as far as governments are concerned.
[03:12:12.686 --> 03:12:15.912]  And the public are now being trained that that is so as well.
[03:12:16.576 --> 03:12:21.799]  Absolutely, and in the UK right now, they have now banned 16 people from coming into the country.
[03:12:21.839 --> 03:12:25.562]  They're only releasing 10 names, who knows who the other 6 are.
[03:12:25.842 --> 03:12:31.986]  But this same woman is out there saying, you know what, on top of that, this ID card is great, we can play that clip.
[03:12:32.026 --> 03:12:34.988]  In fact, we'll play that clip coming up in the next segment.
[03:12:35.328 --> 03:12:45.855]  She's basically saying, oh, the biometric thumb scan and your face scan will be on this card and it's a good thing because people already have to prove who they are and it's really inconvenient if you have to bring in your electric bill.
[03:12:46.235 --> 03:12:49.817]  It's a big part and again it was planned a long time ago because back in the 90s on mainstream Canadian CBC government television
[03:13:09.238 --> 03:13:13.279]  Wendy Mesler had a show where she talked about the coming I.D.
[03:13:13.319 --> 03:13:15.920]  cards in the mid-nineties, actually it was 1998.
[03:13:16.861 --> 03:13:20.702]  And she talked to the manufacturers that would be manufacturing it for Canada, the U.S.
[03:13:20.842 --> 03:13:21.342]  and Britain.
[03:13:22.162 --> 03:13:27.364]  She talked to the Border Patrol guys, too, who had already implemented it on a voluntary basis back in 1998.
[03:13:29.045 --> 03:13:35.207]  And when she says, well, a lot of people won't like this, to the heads of the corporation that prints them up and makes them,
[03:13:36.025 --> 03:13:39.167]  The guy said the public will be given no option anyway.
[03:13:39.187 --> 03:13:40.647]  They'll have to take it.
[03:13:40.988 --> 03:13:47.171]  So this is a plan that was made a long time ago and it's simply being ran through under the guise of security.
[03:13:47.911 --> 03:13:52.513]  Yeah, and meanwhile we have the internet being regulated at all ends.
[03:13:52.573 --> 03:13:56.155]  We have this Cyber Security Act being introduced by Jay Rockefeller.
[03:13:56.415 --> 03:14:04.019]  We now have HR 1966, the Cyber Bullying Act, where really they say, oh, we have to save the children from the internet.
[03:14:04.059 --> 03:14:04.339]  I don't know.
[03:14:20.954 --> 03:14:25.696]  In five years, had a bad experience on the internet, supposedly caused their mental illness.
[03:14:25.736 --> 03:14:26.797]  We know that's not the case.
[03:14:26.817 --> 03:14:32.880]  They were probably mentally ill or just put into that subsection so that they could heavily medicate them as that's part of the plan.
[03:14:33.100 --> 03:14:38.243]  And then they say 54% of these clients were 18 years of age or younger.
[03:14:38.303 --> 03:14:39.743]  I mean, that's just ludicrous.
[03:14:39.763 --> 03:14:43.165]  So let's just shut down the internet or let's just charge people.
[03:14:43.205 --> 03:14:48.708]  They're saying that they'll be able to charge people and convict them and they'll have to do two years in prison and pay a fine.
[03:14:50.084 --> 03:14:51.705]  It's much, much bigger than that even.
[03:14:52.105 --> 03:14:55.347]  FDR said there are lies in politics.
[03:14:55.487 --> 03:14:56.628]  Then there are damned lies.
[03:14:57.348 --> 03:14:58.809]  And then there are statistics.
[03:14:59.830 --> 03:15:02.451]  Because with statistics you can prove anything you want to prove, you see.
[03:15:02.472 --> 03:15:04.173]  And we don't see them as lies.
[03:15:04.473 --> 03:15:05.753]  We think it's scientific data.
[03:15:06.114 --> 03:15:07.595]  That's why they're always saying it's statistics.
[03:15:08.115 --> 03:15:09.516]  But it's just lies nonetheless.
[03:15:09.556 --> 03:15:10.436]  They have an agenda.
[03:15:10.836 --> 03:15:16.600]  The internet was put out there to get everyone on it because they could not have a totally controlled society
[03:15:17.478 --> 03:15:21.279]  Uh, without using the internet and getting us hooked on it for everything.
[03:15:21.699 --> 03:15:23.880]  Now we're going into a world cashless society.
[03:15:23.900 --> 03:15:28.281]  We're going into a world where you can't pay your rent, your mortgage, or anything except through internet.
[03:15:28.681 --> 03:15:32.543]  So eventually, if they blacklist you, you'll be unable to pay for anything.
[03:15:32.563 --> 03:15:34.683]  You'll be an outcast, you'll be on the streets.
[03:15:35.043 --> 03:15:38.665]  And then you use it as a form of punishment and control on the public.
[03:15:38.705 --> 03:15:39.705]  That's why we've got it.
[03:15:40.525 --> 03:15:47.470]  And so many people are out there volunteering their information, not even realizing how serious it is.
[03:15:47.690 --> 03:15:52.653]  When you have a Facebook page, and I have a Facebook page, I have a MySpace, but I'm not constantly updating.
[03:15:52.693 --> 03:15:57.736]  People put their status on there, they literally tell their life story, what I'm doing at this minute, that minute, this minute.
[03:15:57.957 --> 03:16:00.478]  They put up pictures from every event they've ever been to.
[03:16:00.778 --> 03:16:03.340]  I've never been a big picture hound, I don't really post that much stuff.
[03:16:03.580 --> 03:16:08.984]  But they are literally creating a profile on themselves that will be data-based by this government.
[03:16:09.528 --> 03:16:12.649]  It's already been stated by the British and Canadian governments.
[03:16:12.709 --> 03:16:18.852]  They're using everything that you put up voluntarily as legal evidence should they ever have to use it against you.
[03:16:19.873 --> 03:16:20.293]  Absolutely.
[03:16:20.313 --> 03:16:33.859]  You know, I want to go and I want to play this clip of this monster of a woman who is banned against 16 people from her country and is gleefully talking about the coming identification cards in the United Kingdom.
[03:16:33.879 --> 03:16:34.359]  Hit it, Jaren.
[03:16:36.658 --> 03:16:41.340]  The key words for me when it comes to the identity service are security and convenience.
[03:16:41.740 --> 03:16:54.285]  You know, let's be clear, we already wander quite often around the streets with large amounts of personal information, utility bills, passports, other information that we need to use at the moment to prove our identity.
[03:16:54.725 --> 03:17:05.129]  An identity card is a more secure and convenient way to do something that we're already having to do without actually sharing as much personal data as we now have to.
[03:17:05.669 --> 03:17:18.457]  But I think it's right as well, when we're thinking about the convenience of how you enroll your facial image, your fingerprints, both for ID cards and incidentally for biometric passports, that we make that as convenient as possible for the public.
[03:17:18.977 --> 03:17:24.120]  We're used in this country to having our digital photos taken for our passports in high street outlets.
[03:17:24.621 --> 03:17:30.884]  I believe that we can offer that opportunity to people to have their biometric fingerprints taken as well.
[03:17:30.904 --> 03:17:35.147]  And we can do that in a secure way, but in a way that's also convenient to people.
[03:17:35.467 --> 03:17:38.268]  So it's not a white elephant, it's Mr Green, who's referred to.
[03:17:39.048 --> 03:17:44.890]  Well, look, there are 70,000, by the end of this year there'll be 70,000 ID cards already in people's hands.
[03:17:44.910 --> 03:17:45.491]  There's already 30,000.
[03:17:45.551 --> 03:17:49.912]  They're helping foreign nationals to prove their right to be here.
[03:17:50.132 --> 03:17:53.393]  They're helping employers to be more secure that people have got the right to work.
[03:17:54.014 --> 03:17:55.814]  We're already having to prove our identity.
[03:17:55.894 --> 03:18:00.616]  I think it's the role of government to help people to do that more securely and more conveniently.
[03:18:01.016 --> 03:18:13.260]  And at the same time, to help people to protect their identity, so that I can be confident that somebody else isn't pretending to be me, either so that they can commit crime or even terrorism, or that they can defraud me.
[03:18:13.280 --> 03:18:19.282]  It seems to me those are the sorts of protections that government has a responsibility to put in place for its citizens.
[03:18:19.662 --> 03:18:24.623]  If the Tories don't want to take that responsibility on, that's up to them, they'll have to explain it to the electorate.
[03:18:25.004 --> 03:18:29.165]  But for me, that's an important role of what government being on the side of the public is about.
[03:18:29.588 --> 03:18:41.797]  You see, government's here to help and protect and stop terror, and she just makes up all these ludicrous lies that people are just randomly wandering around with their bills and their information and their passports.
[03:18:41.857 --> 03:18:45.740]  People carry their passports when they're leaving the country or entering another one.
[03:18:45.760 --> 03:18:49.442]  I only carry my electric bill when I'm going to pay it, Alan.
[03:18:49.462 --> 03:18:52.004]  I mean, her arguments are absolutely insane.
[03:18:53.165 --> 03:18:54.506]  Well, they're no arguments at all.
[03:18:54.586 --> 03:18:57.328]  It's just a political liar giving you the spiel.
[03:18:58.070 --> 03:18:58.870]  And that's her job.
[03:18:59.690 --> 03:19:04.272]  Politicians don't see the public as someone they're responsible to.
[03:19:04.772 --> 03:19:14.614]  They see the public as basically just a big herd that must be manipulated and lied to in order to get what's right for them, how they should behave and how they should act, etc.
[03:19:15.214 --> 03:19:21.996]  Back in the 90s, Canada and the US and all British Commonwealth countries brought it and bought in.
[03:19:22.016 --> 03:19:24.797]  I mean, Canada alone bought five Super Cray computers.
[03:19:25.649 --> 03:19:26.970]  Australia did the same thing.
[03:19:27.511 --> 03:19:30.053]  These were owned by the post office of all places.
[03:19:31.054 --> 03:19:33.937]  And they created massive buildings for them.
[03:19:35.138 --> 03:19:40.884]  No one could tell us what they were for, because one super-crazy computer could handle all the data of everyone in the US and Canada.
[03:19:41.701 --> 03:19:45.502]  It turns out it was for the coming ID cards that we're now hearing about.
[03:19:45.762 --> 03:19:46.923]  This is back in the 90s.
[03:19:46.943 --> 03:19:49.164]  We're already building the facilities for it.
[03:19:49.584 --> 03:19:57.147]  We're simply living through an agenda, and it's the politician's job simply to con us, to go along with it, taking us under the guise of terrorism.
[03:19:57.227 --> 03:19:59.667]  Absolutely, and we'll be back to discuss that on the other side.
[03:19:59.727 --> 03:20:00.708]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:01.855 --> 03:20:05.097]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[03:20:05.337 --> 03:20:09.679]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[03:20:09.880 --> 03:20:17.744]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[03:20:18.069 --> 03:20:20.910]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[03:20:21.190 --> 03:20:28.732]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[03:20:28.812 --> 03:20:34.413]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[03:20:34.633 --> 03:20:40.195]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[03:20:40.475 --> 03:20:43.716]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[03:20:43.956 --> 03:20:46.517]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:20:46.537 --> 03:20:50.279]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:14.227 --> 03:21:20.409]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:20.429 --> 03:21:22.550]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:22.690 --> 03:21:25.091]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:25.151 --> 03:21:36.114]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:21:38.335 --> 03:21:39.635]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:40.015 --> 03:21:41.376]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:21:41.869 --> 03:21:48.235]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:21:57.042 --> 03:21:58.203]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.624 --> 03:21:59.805]  The people strike back.
[03:22:01.405 --> 03:22:07.630]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:22:08.091 --> 03:22:15.858]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:22:16.198 --> 03:22:24.085]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[03:22:24.385 --> 03:22:29.129]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:22:29.457 --> 03:22:34.161]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:22:34.681 --> 03:22:38.544]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[03:22:39.024 --> 03:22:40.045]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:40.105 --> 03:22:44.208]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[03:22:44.629 --> 03:22:45.990]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[03:22:49.514 --> 03:22:52.075]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[03:22:56.396 --> 03:22:59.837]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:23:00.857 --> 03:23:10.920]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[03:23:13.609 --> 03:23:13.949]  I think so.

[03:24:17.891 --> 03:24:19.312]  All right, folks, we are back.
[03:24:19.453 --> 03:24:21.374]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:21.414 --> 03:24:22.415]  I'm Jason Burmas, sitting in.
[03:24:22.435 --> 03:24:32.484]  We're joined by Alan Watt of CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com and, you know, the Bilderberg meeting, where a lot of these elites get together and really codify their agenda.
[03:24:34.107 --> 03:24:38.909]  We'll be meeting in about one week over in, I think it's going to be in Greece this year.
[03:24:39.489 --> 03:24:48.252]  And we reported a couple weeks ago that I think it was Enyan Devney saying that they had created the Euro through the Bilderberg Group.
[03:24:48.272 --> 03:24:53.834]  Now remember the Bilderberg Group didn't exist and then they said, oh it's just a golf club and they don't set any policy there.
[03:24:54.215 --> 03:24:54.915]  Obvious lies.
[03:24:55.700 --> 03:25:08.677]  However, right now, and this is storiesoveratprisonplanet.com, leaked 1955 Bilderberg documents outline plan for a single European currency almost 40 years before it was codified in 1992.
[03:25:10.680 --> 03:25:18.083]  Now, this isn't a surprise to you or me, Alan, but it really does speak to the fact that these guys are the policy makers.
[03:25:18.163 --> 03:25:26.726]  They are people who believe that they are our lords, our gods, the people who should rule over us, the masses, the sheeple, the, uh, chattel, if you will.
[03:25:26.746 --> 03:25:33.769]  I mean, those are the names they call us, and this is just a further illustration that they are the puppet masters behind the scenes.
[03:25:35.170 --> 03:25:38.611]  There's certainly one of the main groups, there's no doubt about it, but even
[03:25:39.742 --> 03:25:40.702]  John Maynard Keynes
[03:25:58.341 --> 03:26:09.870]  He said that they'll bring in a unitary currency for Europe, and then one for the Americas later, and also a global currency, although he said they wouldn't see the global currency in his lifetime, that would be the next century, which is now.
[03:26:10.410 --> 03:26:16.395]  But as I say, we're living through a script, and when you find their old books, you have no doubt about it whatsoever.
[03:26:17.564 --> 03:26:21.769]  So what do you think is going to be on the agenda this year at the Bilderberg Group?
[03:26:21.829 --> 03:26:23.131]  I mean, again, they meet in a week.
[03:26:23.752 --> 03:26:26.655]  In my mind, there's 144 public members.
[03:26:26.956 --> 03:26:31.080]  So it's kind of like this compartmentalized group of people, very small.
[03:26:31.441 --> 03:26:35.766]  And then in another month or so, they're going to be meeting at the Bohemian Grove when you have 3,000 people there.
[03:26:36.827 --> 03:26:42.889]  And those people who are at the Bilderberg Group will give their agenda to their underlings at the Bohemian Grove.
[03:26:42.949 --> 03:26:46.471]  So you have a system where it's a need-to-know system.
[03:26:46.531 --> 03:26:55.014]  Some people are more in the know than others, and the people in the Bohemian Grove, most of them are less in the know, say, than those that attended the Bilderberg Conference.
[03:26:55.034 --> 03:26:59.216]  They're given an agenda, they're given a job to carry out, but they may not know why.
[03:27:00.920 --> 03:27:09.022]  And also, too, I think the big thing will be the true bringing up of the International Monetary Fund to its proper place.
[03:27:09.782 --> 03:27:13.382]  They've already admitted they're going to be the world's issuers of currency.
[03:27:13.402 --> 03:27:18.003]  That'll be part one, but also the biggest part, too, is also population control.
[03:27:18.043 --> 03:27:25.505]  Now, they're really on a roll to get the public to accept they must have population reduction by government law and order, etc.
[03:27:26.730 --> 03:27:27.190]  Absolutely.
[03:27:27.210 --> 03:27:32.851]  We played some of those clips because we had one of those heckler callers in the beginning go, oh, they want to kill 80% of us.
[03:27:32.872 --> 03:27:34.612]  Well, those are in their own documents.
[03:27:34.952 --> 03:27:40.953]  And you've got Ted Turner running around saying there's already too many people on the planet and we need to save sustainable society.
[03:27:41.153 --> 03:27:47.255]  Then we actually have the World Sustainable Society, this organization with Gordon Brown and others, including
[03:27:47.515 --> 03:27:57.143]  The global warming czar of the Obama administration, who's openly for global governance, and in these groups they say, well, we're just going to have to take the population down.
[03:27:57.183 --> 03:28:06.050]  We have people talking about taking the population from the UK from, it's at 60 million officially, it's probably more like 70 million, down to 30 million by 2027.
[03:28:07.291 --> 03:28:11.935]  How is that going to be possible unless they sterilize everybody and kill half the population?
[03:28:12.603 --> 03:28:14.364]  Yeah, well, they're already sterilizing people.
[03:28:14.584 --> 03:28:16.484]  They've admitted that now it's happening.
[03:28:16.524 --> 03:28:22.186]  It's just a pure coincidence they were putting the very agents, the sterilizers, in the water and in the food since 1950.
[03:28:23.547 --> 03:28:26.447]  And obviously the inoculations as well certainly helped along the way.
[03:28:27.068 --> 03:28:32.069]  But now they're going into, they want their rights now to mandate who can breed, who cannot breed.
[03:28:32.669 --> 03:28:34.670]  Because it's not a matter of overpopulation.
[03:28:34.690 --> 03:28:38.371]  And all those statistics, remember, have been fudged since the days of Malthus.
[03:28:38.511 --> 03:28:40.452]  He used graphs and charts and fake statistics.
[03:28:41.454 --> 03:28:43.856]  But that doesn't matter as long as the public believe it.
[03:28:44.336 --> 03:28:47.638]  Because we must acquiesce by our silence to their demands.
[03:28:48.038 --> 03:28:51.200]  They want the right to literally sterilize people.
[03:28:51.460 --> 03:28:53.721]  And that's been in the British newspapers quite recently.
[03:28:54.502 --> 03:28:56.323]  So that's really what it's all about.
[03:28:56.623 --> 03:28:57.804]  It's not that there's too many people.
[03:28:57.824 --> 03:29:00.706]  There's too many of the wrong sort of people.
[03:29:01.126 --> 03:29:04.048]  The ones who haven't evolved as far as those at the Bilderberger.
[03:29:04.946 --> 03:29:21.340]  Yeah, no, they honestly believe that they should rule over us, they're smarter than us, they're more intelligent than us, and we are just, we're cannon fodder for them, and we are being groomed to be either a dead or a slave race to serve them, and I don't know about you, but I'm not going to be licking any boots, I'm not going to be sucking
[03:29:21.420 --> 03:29:28.285]  My thumb in a fetal position, just waiting for them to give me a Baxter vaccination that's going to save me from the oh-so-dangerous swine flu.
[03:29:28.686 --> 03:29:29.146]  Oh no!
[03:29:29.206 --> 03:29:30.607]  The swine flu's going to get us!
[03:29:30.887 --> 03:29:34.910]  Meanwhile, we don't have any, let me repeat this, any deaths in the United States.
[03:29:34.950 --> 03:29:37.692]  The two-year-old boy that died had chronic health problems.
[03:29:37.712 --> 03:29:38.673]  He was a premature baby.
[03:29:38.733 --> 03:29:39.614]  He was from Mexico.
[03:29:39.874 --> 03:29:46.659]  And we played you the clip where the Associated Press tries to say that swine flu killed this woman, and then they have to go, oh well, actually it didn't.
[03:29:46.719 --> 03:29:47.860]  You know, they're falling short of that.
[03:29:47.980 --> 03:29:48.761]  We'll be back after this.
[03:29:48.801 --> 03:29:50.022]  Taking your calls with Alan Watt.
[03:29:52.048 --> 03:29:55.049]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.970 --> 03:29:58.791]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.872 --> 03:30:04.433]  You are a rebel, admit it.
[03:30:04.773 --> 03:30:07.554]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[03:30:07.734 --> 03:30:09.835]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[03:30:10.135 --> 03:30:13.836]  Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[03:30:14.076 --> 03:30:15.657]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot.
[03:30:19.267 --> 03:30:25.512]  Einstein failed math, quit school, and his rebel ideas led to some of the world's most amazing discoveries.
[03:30:25.772 --> 03:30:30.335]  Edison rebelled against the dark, failed over a thousand times, then invented the light bulb.
[03:30:30.435 --> 03:30:35.039]  George Washington rebelled against an entire country and led the creation of a new one.
[03:30:35.199 --> 03:30:38.261]  Now Alex Jones is working to save that very country.
[03:30:38.421 --> 03:30:39.822]  So go ahead, be a rebel.
[03:30:39.983 --> 03:30:42.605]  Put in a food supply from efoodsdirect.com.
[03:30:42.805 --> 03:30:45.707]  Everyone will realize you were not a nutcase after all.
[03:30:52.210 --> 03:30:56.513]  800-409-5633, efoodsdirect.com.
[03:30:56.813 --> 03:30:57.533]  That's 800-409-5633.
[03:30:58.314 --> 03:31:07.519]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:08.020 --> 03:31:15.044]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[03:31:15.604 --> 03:31:21.768]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:22.168 --> 03:31:24.010]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:24.150 --> 03:31:26.572]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:31:26.652 --> 03:31:37.642]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:31:38.222 --> 03:31:39.523]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:39.904 --> 03:31:41.285]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:31:41.765 --> 03:31:48.011]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:31:48.661 --> 03:31:56.436]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:31:56.937 --> 03:31:58.079]  The Obama Deception.
[03:31:58.520 --> 03:31:59.702]  The people strike back!
[03:32:01.477 --> 03:32:08.442]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[03:32:08.682 --> 03:32:12.985]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:32:13.246 --> 03:32:18.349]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[03:32:18.850 --> 03:32:25.915]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid, and regain your health and energy.
[03:32:26.375 --> 03:32:31.337]  Simply put, 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[03:32:31.757 --> 03:32:37.218]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:32:37.598 --> 03:32:43.080]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.
[03:32:43.400 --> 03:32:49.125]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[03:32:49.346 --> 03:32:51.868]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.

[03:32:52.869 --> 03:32:53.089]  269-216-9767 today!
[03:33:25.201 --> 03:33:26.522]  All right, folks, we are back.
[03:33:26.742 --> 03:33:27.743]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:27.763 --> 03:33:30.904]  We're joined by Alan Watt of CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com.
[03:33:31.665 --> 03:33:37.908]  We've had some callers on for a couple hours, and I apologize for that, but we're going to take your calls right now for myself and Alan Watt.
[03:33:38.188 --> 03:33:39.929]  Let's go to Stephen in Texas.
[03:33:39.949 --> 03:33:40.590]  Stephen, you're online.
[03:33:41.624 --> 03:33:43.326]  Yeah, hey Jason and hey Ellen.
[03:33:44.167 --> 03:33:49.872]  I just want to say, first of all, Jason, I want to correct you on something from this guy three hours earlier.
[03:33:49.892 --> 03:33:51.374]  I got his real name.
[03:33:53.836 --> 03:33:56.859]  His real name is... I don't want you to give it out.
[03:33:56.959 --> 03:33:59.481]  We know who it is and a lot of people who are listening know who it is.
[03:33:59.501 --> 03:34:01.443]  I don't want to give him more attention than he already has.
[03:34:01.884 --> 03:34:05.207]  You know, he hasn't called in months and months and months, but it's just ridiculous.
[03:34:05.267 --> 03:34:05.928]  I mean, come on.
[03:34:06.588 --> 03:34:09.411]  I mean, he wants to sit here and act like a child on the program.
[03:34:09.431 --> 03:34:16.979]  Meanwhile, all's we're doing is reading mainline news sources and articles and playing their own video clips with words coming out of their own mouth, Steven.
[03:34:17.980 --> 03:34:21.304]  Yeah, well, I was just gonna say, it's Moe, and his last name's Ron.
[03:34:23.827 --> 03:34:25.289]  Okay, that's his real name.
[03:34:25.689 --> 03:34:26.390]  Yes, I agree.
[03:34:26.410 --> 03:34:26.650]  Thank you.
[03:34:26.990 --> 03:34:28.071]  I just had to get that in.
[03:34:29.092 --> 03:34:36.059]  But I wanted to say, the last couple days, doing the business I do, I do health insurance.
[03:34:37.341 --> 03:34:41.702]  You know, it's funny because I even had somebody from the post office call me back.
[03:34:41.742 --> 03:34:45.223]  I had to go down there and pick up a package because they screwed up a delivery.
[03:34:45.723 --> 03:34:53.846]  And so the way they called me, and this is what I'm doing, I'm talking now about being proactive because we've got this mentality, I'm only one person, what can I do?
[03:34:54.926 --> 03:35:01.288]  Well, there's one person that you work with there that started that whole thing, and look what's happened as a result of what Alex has done.
[03:35:01.328 --> 03:35:04.609]  Well, this woman from the Post Office, I just happened to mention her.
[03:35:04.629 --> 03:35:08.851]  I said, hey, before you go, I just want to ask you, are you concerned about the economy?
[03:35:09.011 --> 03:35:09.831]  And she said, yeah.
[03:35:10.211 --> 03:35:12.772]  And I said, well, would you like to know what's behind it?
[03:35:12.832 --> 03:35:13.693]  And she said, sure.
[03:35:14.133 --> 03:35:15.093]  And I said, okay.
[03:35:15.273 --> 03:35:16.754]  And I gave her InfoWars.
[03:35:16.834 --> 03:35:18.554]  I told her about the Obama deception.
[03:35:18.614 --> 03:35:20.815]  I gave her Jason Vermas and Alex Jones.
[03:35:21.235 --> 03:35:22.536]  Tell them when you guys are on.
[03:35:22.976 --> 03:35:26.438]  And she goes, you know, my husband's really into talk radio.
[03:35:26.478 --> 03:35:30.860]  And I said, well, if you're into talk radio, you definitely want to listen to these guys.
[03:35:30.940 --> 03:35:33.701]  And you definitely want to get a copy of The Obama Deception.
[03:35:34.181 --> 03:35:37.143]  And I mean, I'm finding this more and more, Jason.
[03:35:37.203 --> 03:35:43.465]  People overall are more and more open to listen because of the crisis they're in.
[03:35:43.886 --> 03:35:48.768]  I've got a guy recently who is a good personal friend of mine, and this is what's really disappointing.
[03:35:49.208 --> 03:36:04.820]  But he's been an exception where I actually emailed a link to the article on InfoWars about Ashley, this 16 year old kid that was taken by DHS two months ago in North Carolina.
[03:36:04.960 --> 03:36:09.362]  But you gotta understand, Wired just did a story bashing Alex Jones saying it doesn't exist.
[03:36:09.462 --> 03:36:11.523]  Oh, he wasn't arrested under the Patriot Act.
[03:36:12.023 --> 03:36:14.364]  Oh, you know, you can't fake an IP address.
[03:36:14.404 --> 03:36:14.904]  Give me a break.
[03:36:14.924 --> 03:36:17.045]  They went in in the middle of the night jackboot cops.
[03:36:17.065 --> 03:36:18.706]  He hasn't been able to talk to his mother since.
[03:36:18.966 --> 03:36:20.467]  What else could they be charging him with?
[03:36:21.147 --> 03:36:31.817]  Yeah, and the thing is, but this friend emails me back, he says, well, I appreciate you sending this to me and thinking about me, but I don't adhere to these radical views, so please don't send me any more of that kind of stuff.
[03:36:31.837 --> 03:36:40.946]  So what I do, I took like over an hour and I gave him a ton of details because he says, I definitely don't agree with you saying that the Bush family are a crime syndicate.
[03:36:41.406 --> 03:36:47.249]  And I just gave him a ton of stuff that I knew, and I haven't heard back from him since, so hopefully it'll give him enough to think about.
[03:36:47.269 --> 03:36:56.194]  But overall, I found people are being more and more receptive to this message, because they know something's up, and they can see that there's something that's going down.
[03:36:56.214 --> 03:37:02.877]  And I've told people, if you don't wake up very soon, we're not going to have any United States of America, as we know.
[03:37:02.897 --> 03:37:03.597]  Absolutely, Steven.
[03:37:03.637 --> 03:37:06.559]  And we do have to be proactive, my friend, and I thank you for the call.
[03:37:06.579 --> 03:37:08.280]  Let's jump to Bob in Wisconsin.
[03:37:08.320 --> 03:37:09.060]  Bob, you're on the line.
[03:37:10.501 --> 03:37:10.781]  Yes, sir.
[03:37:13.052 --> 03:37:14.053]  Once, twice, Bob?
[03:37:14.913 --> 03:37:16.794]  Alright, Junior in New York, you're on the air.
[03:37:16.814 --> 03:37:19.516]  Hey Junior, can you guys hear me?
[03:37:19.916 --> 03:37:20.256]  Yes, sir.
[03:37:20.276 --> 03:37:33.083]  Alright, um, uh, basically, they passed through my neighborhood the other day doing, uh, the census, and I wasn't here, but my neighbor was here, and I was curious, like, what could these GPS coordinates be for?
[03:37:33.503 --> 03:37:35.545]  I know that you guys are saying SWAT teams, but...
[03:37:36.665 --> 03:37:38.286]  Listen, I don't want to say SWAT teams.
[03:37:38.786 --> 03:37:50.250]  That might be something that Alex Jones has said, and obviously they can use GPS coordinates if they want to get to your house and you're off the grid and use SWAT against you if you're a terrorist, underlined in this DHS document.
[03:37:50.270 --> 03:37:55.452]  But what it is, is to create this massive control grid to document everybody's home.
[03:37:55.492 --> 03:38:02.695]  And that's why the Census Bureau is going to every single house and GPSing outside of your house 40 feet at the least.
[03:38:03.015 --> 03:38:04.095]  Alan, why don't you talk about that?
[03:38:04.135 --> 03:38:04.956]  What do you think some of the...
[03:38:06.391 --> 03:38:21.977]  Um, I wanted to actually ask Alan, because I know he knows, I never really, uh, I just wanted to know if he thinks that there's any possibility that they could be using these coordinates with HAARP to zap targeted houses or, you know, if they have certain people that they want to hit with the HAARP.
[03:38:22.657 --> 03:38:24.858]  Before Alan answers that, Alan, I want you to answer this.
[03:38:25.838 --> 03:38:33.479]  I'll answer that in a second, but I just want to say this, you know, they're creating a database and a control grid so they know who to go after.
[03:38:33.519 --> 03:38:39.240]  I don't think it has, you know, much to do with, oh, we're going to GPS everybody and now we're going to use HAARP weapons against them.
[03:38:39.300 --> 03:38:47.942]  No, they want to database everybody first, put you into different subcategories, see who the real threats are, see who the free thinkers are, and then take action from there.
[03:38:48.222 --> 03:38:49.062]  Alan, what's your take?
[03:38:49.822 --> 03:38:53.543]  Back in the 70s, I talked to a guy who worked for the British.
[03:38:54.501 --> 03:38:54.822]  I don't
[03:39:13.132 --> 03:39:23.496]  And he said, right now, and that's true, at that time, we were all being trained to put down our postal codes, even though the postal codes were not used by the post office for another 15 years.
[03:39:24.036 --> 03:39:32.259]  He says, we're presently training the public to always write their postal code, he says, because eventually everyone will be categorized under various codes.
[03:39:32.579 --> 03:39:33.499]  That's all he would say.
[03:39:34.019 --> 03:39:37.801]  What he really meant, I think, was political codes, etc., viewpoints, and so on.
[03:39:38.201 --> 03:39:39.941]  So that was part of it, and that was literally 1972.
[03:39:42.603 --> 03:39:45.224]  I mean, this is just an extension of the control grid, don't you?
[03:39:45.264 --> 03:39:47.346]  I mean, they want to get people that are off the grid.
[03:39:47.906 --> 03:39:57.052]  They want you to be a part of this huge control grid where they can zoom in on your house from a satellite, they know exactly where you live, who you are, and they have that data.
[03:39:57.592 --> 03:40:05.257]  They have the data, and they do flyovers too, and if they want to check out your house, they can infrared it and see what's in it and all the rest of it.
[03:40:05.337 --> 03:40:07.038]  There's a whole bunch of reasons they can use it.
[03:40:07.418 --> 03:40:09.900]  But also remember, they're always working on the future.
[03:40:10.683 --> 03:40:17.969]  And in the future for Agenda 21, depending on where you are and which region and area you're in, and they do have regions marked down across the U.S.
[03:40:18.009 --> 03:40:25.715]  and Canada, they want to get us all off over the next 15, 16 years off the land and into the overcrowded cities.
[03:40:25.795 --> 03:40:30.980]  So probably all tied together, many functions all in one thing going on right now.
[03:40:31.720 --> 03:40:33.162]  I'll be part to do with that as well.
[03:40:33.482 --> 03:40:40.730]  Also remember they're going after the US just passing that law, putting that law through where they own all water in the United States internally.
[03:40:41.428 --> 03:40:45.671]  So if you happen to be on top of a nice deep well or something like that, they might just want that.
[03:40:46.232 --> 03:40:48.253]  Or they might not let you have access to your own water.
[03:40:48.434 --> 03:40:50.435]  There's a whole bunch of reasons that they're doing this for.
[03:40:50.455 --> 03:40:53.097]  It's all data collection for every facet of your life.
[03:40:53.277 --> 03:40:56.960]  Well, let's say they also pass this bill where you're not supposed to have an organic farm.
[03:40:56.980 --> 03:41:06.247]  It's going to be a lot easier for them, once they GPS your house, realize how big it is, to just check their satellite and say, oh my god, this guy's got a victory garden, he's a terrorist, let's go get him.
[03:41:06.307 --> 03:41:10.571]  I mean, it's a total surveillance, total control grid, and that's why they want that information.
[03:41:11.095 --> 03:41:14.297]  Yes, and that was all part of the real Star Wars program.
[03:41:14.317 --> 03:41:21.142]  It was all for the future, which is now, and what's coming up, and tracking and coordinating, etc.
[03:41:21.442 --> 03:41:22.343]  It's all part of it.
[03:41:22.383 --> 03:41:32.570]  So when they come to you personally and do it in your home... Remember, even the guy who reads your electric meter punches that little GPS satellite when he punches in the meter readings.
[03:41:32.830 --> 03:41:34.151]  He also punches in where he is.
[03:41:34.171 --> 03:41:36.132]  So they've been doing this for years.
[03:41:36.993 --> 03:41:37.533]  Absolutely.
[03:41:37.693 --> 03:41:39.614]  Let's jump to Devin in California.
[03:41:39.634 --> 03:41:40.295]  Devin, you're on the air.
[03:41:41.963 --> 03:41:42.803]  Hey, how you doing guys?
[03:41:42.863 --> 03:41:46.904]  Hey, I just wanted to go over a few things.
[03:41:47.644 --> 03:41:48.585]  I was in the U.S.
[03:41:48.605 --> 03:41:48.865]  military.
[03:41:48.925 --> 03:41:54.826]  I got out in 2004, and I'll tell you, when I went to boot camp in Arizona, South Carolina, we had tons
[03:42:10.808 --> 03:42:11.368]  I don't know.
[03:42:28.194 --> 03:42:32.996]  Hold on one second, I just want you to speak to that.
[03:42:33.316 --> 03:42:43.480]  Why don't you explain to people, Alan, how we are now being, you know, our military is being integrated with NATO and foreign military forces for this new global system.
[03:42:44.580 --> 03:42:51.562]  Well, under the plan for, I think it was called Fortress America, it was in the papers maybe three years ago, or 2005 in fact,
[03:42:53.573 --> 03:42:59.657]  They said that the Canadian forces, US, Mexican and other Latin American countries were already amalgamating.
[03:43:00.217 --> 03:43:11.004]  But the second part of it all was, you've seen it in the paper too, that not only will they eat the whole of America's amalgamate, but now to amalgamate also with the European Union community.
[03:43:11.024 --> 03:43:19.169]  So they're creating a new world army that's been in the press in the European papers, a world army.
[03:43:19.728 --> 03:43:24.372]  And every country will send members to it to be part of this world army.
[03:43:25.093 --> 03:43:26.193]  So this is all part of it.
[03:43:26.213 --> 03:43:27.555]  It's a multicultural force.
[03:43:28.135 --> 03:43:41.646]  I think about 15 years ago in the Council on Foreign Relations own magazine, Foreign Affairs, they said it had world meetings to discuss how to create this new world army, because it was one thing.
[03:43:41.666 --> 03:43:46.510]  It was easier to get you to stand up for your old tribal emblems, your flag, et cetera, the songs and all that.
[03:43:47.173 --> 03:43:47.373]  I think?
[03:44:06.640 --> 03:44:15.968]  And create the brotherhood idea that they're special, more special than the civilians, then they hope to use these techniques to bind them together into a truly international force.
[03:44:16.008 --> 03:44:16.728]  So it's quite right.
[03:44:17.249 --> 03:44:18.129]  We're going through that now.
[03:44:18.149 --> 03:44:19.390]  We have been for quite a few years.
[03:44:19.971 --> 03:44:22.152]  Yeah, but it's really in full force right now.
[03:44:22.193 --> 03:44:35.383]  I mean, we're talking about, you know, earlier today we talked about Marine Corps civilian police and we had another military guy call in and say, yeah, a lot of my guys are getting deployed and now it's dudes who are making $14 an hour who we hire off the street, not the MPs anymore.
[03:44:35.643 --> 03:44:39.025]  And that's because they are, first of all, integrating a police state here at home.
[03:44:39.065 --> 03:44:41.927]  They're trying to blur the lines between the military and the police.
[03:44:41.947 --> 03:44:43.589]  They're trying to get rid of Posi Comitatus.
[03:44:43.789 --> 03:45:02.162]  And they're getting us ready for global government and a global military force that you're going to see at the National Level Exercise 09 coming up at the end of July into the beginning of August, headed by FEMA, you know, working with the UK, Australia, Canada, and Mexico in a Terrorist Prevention Act.
[03:45:02.802 --> 03:45:08.126]  Like no one has ever seen, this is the first drill to prevent terror after terrorism occurs in another country.
[03:45:08.346 --> 03:45:10.668]  Let's jump to our next caller, Anne in New York.
[03:45:10.688 --> 03:45:11.289]  You're on the line.
[03:45:12.830 --> 03:45:24.840]  Alright, I just want to say that I'm new to you, and I'm so proud that you are doing what you're doing, that there's a place, that there's a voice that we can hear that is just focusing on what's really going on.
[03:45:24.860 --> 03:45:25.760]  Well, thank you.
[03:45:25.780 --> 03:45:26.381]  And thank you.
[03:45:27.694 --> 03:45:28.834]  I want to touch on three things.
[03:45:28.874 --> 03:45:29.815]  I'm going to be real quick.
[03:45:29.915 --> 03:45:30.875]  I'll share this with you.
[03:45:30.895 --> 03:45:34.776]  I have two different passports plus a green card.
[03:45:35.316 --> 03:45:39.117]  I was recently robbed and I had to go and get my state ID back.
[03:45:40.197 --> 03:45:43.177]  Now, I got my state ID originally four years ago.
[03:45:44.978 --> 03:45:54.880]  When I went to get it back, they have now added something to the form in New York City, which makes you divulge whether you have ever had a Canadian driver's license.
[03:45:55.433 --> 03:46:00.677]  If you have an active one and it makes you put down your driver's license number on this form.
[03:46:00.977 --> 03:46:08.342]  Well right now Canada is enforcing a new ID system where if you take the new ID card I think they're going to be issuing them on June 1st.
[03:46:09.836 --> 03:46:10.697]  No, no, I understand that.
[03:46:10.937 --> 03:46:12.658]  But right now, well, they're trying to blur the line.
[03:46:12.678 --> 03:46:14.399]  They're trying to create this North American Union.
[03:46:14.599 --> 03:46:19.161]  So if you take your RFID, national ID card in Canada, then you won't have to wait in the border.
[03:46:19.201 --> 03:46:19.942]  You'll just have your thing.
[03:46:20.002 --> 03:46:20.802]  Oh, you got your card?
[03:46:20.822 --> 03:46:21.362]  Go ahead.
[03:46:21.382 --> 03:46:23.944]  And they're going to do the same thing in Mexico and America.
[03:46:23.984 --> 03:46:27.686]  They want to integrate this into a new system.
[03:46:28.026 --> 03:46:31.788]  And that was exposed in the Security and Prosperity Partnership Agreements.
[03:46:31.808 --> 03:46:33.509]  Why don't you speak to that really quickly there, Alan.
[03:46:34.546 --> 03:46:41.631]  Yes, and also the EU have said that they have a central computer with all the data of Canadians and the US citizens who have that card.
[03:46:42.052 --> 03:46:45.894]  So it is in actual fact an international ID card.
[03:46:46.475 --> 03:46:46.895]  Exactly.
[03:46:47.015 --> 03:46:48.556]  It even said that in it.
[03:46:48.636 --> 03:46:50.077]  It could go under the guise of a license.
[03:46:50.097 --> 03:46:50.678]  It doesn't matter.
[03:46:50.958 --> 03:46:52.419]  It is the international ID card.
[03:46:52.759 --> 03:46:53.179]  Exactly.
[03:46:53.260 --> 03:46:54.120]  Anne, what else you got for me?
[03:46:55.241 --> 03:46:55.721]  It's here.
[03:46:55.741 --> 03:46:56.802]  Yeah.
[03:46:57.362 --> 03:46:58.663]  And that's the frightening part.
[03:46:59.064 --> 03:47:02.226]  You know, and I'm just so glad you're alerting more and more Americans.
[03:47:02.768 --> 03:47:06.572]  And this Bill HR 875, how realistic is that?
[03:47:06.652 --> 03:47:17.624]  I mean, I've sent letters to the New York Times, to Eden Foods, to every organic group that I can think of, and any response I've gotten back from organic farmers is that they've never even heard of this.
[03:47:17.950 --> 03:47:19.471]  Well, that's absolutely correct.
[03:47:19.491 --> 03:47:22.952]  They haven't heard of it and they're keeping it on the low, but it's as real as it gets.
[03:47:23.212 --> 03:47:27.853]  They always talk about it after they've passed some kind of legislation towards it.
[03:47:28.414 --> 03:47:33.896]  They have programmed us to think that GMO foods are going to save us and you don't need organic farming.
[03:47:33.916 --> 03:47:41.978]  In fact, organic farming is bad because it doesn't go through the proper processes and that's the reason we have swine flu and bird flu outbreaks and people are unhealthy.
[03:47:42.278 --> 03:47:43.859]  Meanwhile, these GMO foods
[03:47:47.942 --> 03:47:53.705]  There's no doubt about it.
[03:47:53.766 --> 03:47:58.449]  And I read from their own articles, the big players, on depopulation agendas.
[03:47:58.989 --> 03:48:01.671]  I keep asking the public, what do you think they mean by that?
[03:48:02.091 --> 03:48:06.214]  Just a wish list of things they'd love to do at Christmas time in Santa Claus.
[03:48:06.554 --> 03:48:07.655]  They actually implement them.
[03:48:08.536 --> 03:48:10.996]  You cannot ask for volunteers, so you simply implement them.
[03:48:11.317 --> 03:48:12.817]  And you're quite right for the GMO food.
[03:48:13.477 --> 03:48:15.497]  I mean, look at all the guys behind Obama.
[03:48:15.517 --> 03:48:19.298]  He's even got guys there who work for Monsanto on his staff there.
[03:48:19.338 --> 03:48:22.198]  And in fact, they put the bills forward for this particular one.
[03:48:22.939 --> 03:48:26.819]  And we've had it from the Economic Union, we've had it from Britain, from all the Prime Ministers.
[03:48:27.159 --> 03:48:31.560]  They want the GMO to be the sole ruler, basically, food-wise, for the whole planet.
[03:48:31.980 --> 03:48:33.341]  That's the way it's been mandated.
[03:48:33.401 --> 03:48:35.821]  That's why no one can sue Monsanto anywhere.
[03:48:36.716 --> 03:48:39.938]  Uh, that's why doors open for Monsanto and judges know to leave them alone.
[03:48:40.319 --> 03:48:45.382]  It's a must-be, because as far as I'm concerned, you see, food comes under military-industrial complex.
[03:48:45.442 --> 03:48:46.683]  It's the oldest trick in the book.
[03:48:46.763 --> 03:48:48.724]  Control the food or the water, you control the people.
[03:48:49.265 --> 03:48:53.167]  Therefore, uh, Monsanto is part of the military-industrial complex.
[03:48:53.728 --> 03:48:57.070]  Absolutely, and Anne, I hope you look into Codex Elementarius.
[03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:58.771]  There's a lot of scary things within that.
[03:48:58.811 --> 03:48:59.692]  I thank you for the call.
[03:48:59.732 --> 03:49:01.373]  Let's jump to Johnny in Indiana.
[03:49:01.413 --> 03:49:02.193]  Johnny, you're on the line.
[03:49:04.095 --> 03:49:04.415]  Yes, sir.
[03:49:04.455 --> 03:49:04.795]  Hello, Jason.
[03:49:04.815 --> 03:49:05.676]  Can you hear me?
[03:49:06.038 --> 03:49:06.378]  Yes, sir.
[03:49:07.439 --> 03:49:10.240]  I wanted to comment about Ashton, the Ashton Lumbee case.
[03:49:11.001 --> 03:49:11.281]  Okay.
[03:49:12.421 --> 03:49:26.789]  It's here in my town in Southern Indiana, and I heard about it on your show, and I became actively involved in her case, and I brought it to the attention of all my media outlets, and it created such an outcry that the U.S.
[03:49:26.869 --> 03:49:29.030]  Attorney had to respond with a press release.
[03:49:29.330 --> 03:49:30.010]  And what did they say?
[03:49:31.151 --> 03:49:33.072]  They downplayed it.
[03:49:33.112 --> 03:49:35.073]  They commented on the charges, and
[03:49:35.899 --> 03:49:39.543]  And I talked to Annette at least three times a day since I heard about the case.
[03:49:40.664 --> 03:49:48.872]  And they commented on what he was being charged with, and they said that she had access to her child, but that never bothered to go see him.
[03:49:49.993 --> 03:49:59.016]  You know, again, I've got to know more about this case, but I don't think it's right that you come in the middle of the night, you pick up a 16-year-old kid because of a supposed bomb threat.
[03:49:59.476 --> 03:50:03.698]  The kid seems to have an alibi, the mother's telling a different story from what the authorities are telling.
[03:50:03.978 --> 03:50:09.740]  You know, time will tell whether this pans out or not, and I encourage people to go check into it themselves.
[03:50:09.960 --> 03:50:13.201]  Let's jump to Bill in Connecticut.
[03:50:13.381 --> 03:50:13.841]  You're on the air.
[03:50:14.982 --> 03:50:15.662]  Yeah, Connecticut.
[03:50:16.022 --> 03:50:16.122]  Yep.
[03:50:16.142 --> 03:50:17.403]  How you doing, Jason?
[03:50:17.883 --> 03:50:18.403]  How you doing, sir?
[03:50:18.971 --> 03:50:19.211]  Good.
[03:50:19.911 --> 03:50:23.212]  Hey, a couple things pertaining to HR 875.
[03:50:23.872 --> 03:50:32.895]  I was just trying to find it here because I was going to email it over to you, but I actually got a response back from Jim Himes pertaining to that because Delorosa, what's her name?
[03:50:32.915 --> 03:50:34.575]  Delorosa or Rosa?
[03:50:34.916 --> 03:50:35.676]  I think Delorosa, yeah.
[03:50:35.696 --> 03:50:39.357]  Rosa Deloro was the woman who put that out.
[03:50:39.737 --> 03:50:45.959]  And I thought it was interesting because in his response, he was basically saying that she was not married to
[03:50:47.677 --> 03:50:49.860]  You know, one of the guys that actually works at Monsanto?
[03:50:50.981 --> 03:50:51.982]  His name's Greenberg.
[03:50:52.623 --> 03:50:54.124]  But she is married to this guy, right?
[03:50:54.545 --> 03:50:55.726]  Hold over on the other side.
[03:50:55.887 --> 03:50:56.848]  We'll be back after this.
[03:50:57.068 --> 03:50:58.209]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:50:58.309 --> 03:51:01.173]  We're with Alan Watt, cutting through thematrix.com.
[03:51:02.154 --> 03:51:04.757]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[03:51:05.365 --> 03:51:08.347]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[03:51:08.707 --> 03:51:12.109]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[03:51:12.489 --> 03:51:18.673]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[03:51:19.073 --> 03:51:24.116]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[03:51:24.296 --> 03:51:31.000]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[03:51:31.300 --> 03:51:32.161]  Need something more?
[03:51:32.401 --> 03:51:36.046]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[03:51:36.347 --> 03:51:44.417]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.
[03:51:44.657 --> 03:51:49.003]  Mention this ad and receive 10% off of your order and a free self-defense keychain.
[03:51:49.343 --> 03:51:53.045]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.838 --> 03:52:14.180]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.700 --> 03:52:20.902]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:21.222 --> 03:52:23.023]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:23.183 --> 03:52:25.563]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:52:25.643 --> 03:52:36.527]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.832 --> 03:52:40.073]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.493 --> 03:52:41.874]  It's about a one world government.
[03:52:42.355 --> 03:52:48.700]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:49.260 --> 03:52:57.046]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:57.527 --> 03:52:58.688]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:59.108 --> 03:53:00.289]  The people strike back.
[03:53:02.369 --> 03:53:11.935]  Hi, my name is MZ, owner of KSCO in Santa Cruz, California, and like Alex Jones, I'm passionate about talk radio, that great bastion of freedom of expression for us all.
[03:53:12.075 --> 03:53:25.884]  I'm also passionate about helping people know the joys, benefits, and surprisingly simple methods of becoming entrepreneurs who work for themselves and not as wage slaves for someone else, or even worse, for large companies with no heart and soul, nor loyalty to their employees.
[03:53:26.144 --> 03:53:45.310]  If you're tired of being dependent on others for a living and ready to start owning yourself, loving your work, and setting the sky as the limit for your earning potential, I want you to know about an exciting great business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that actually helps people lose weight and can help them make money, perhaps lots of it, just by helping us spread the word about this wonderful unique product.
[03:53:45.410 --> 03:53:48.212]  Get on the web and go to www.chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[03:53:48.273 --> 03:53:51.655]  That's www.chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out our opportunity.
[03:53:51.695 --> 03:53:53.017]  You'll know pretty quick if you're interested.
[03:53:53.077 --> 03:53:55.379]  If you are, we will connect with you and get you up and running.
[03:53:55.419 --> 03:53:58.802]  We don't want any money from you and you'll be amazed at how simple this system is.
[03:53:58.902 --> 03:54:01.304]  Remember www.chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[03:54:02.345 --> 03:54:11.212]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[03:54:20.074 --> 03:54:23.300]  Alright folks, we are back!
[03:54:33.407 --> 03:54:35.148]  It's the Info Warrior with Jason Bermas.
[03:54:35.248 --> 03:54:36.909]  I'm just kidding, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:36.949 --> 03:54:40.911]  But I do a show called that and I'll be live on the air tonight, 9 to midnight.
[03:54:41.772 --> 03:54:43.152]  We're going to be going over a bunch of news.
[03:54:43.192 --> 03:54:45.734]  We just got one of the census forms, so I'm going to be hitting that up.
[03:54:45.834 --> 03:54:50.296]  I missed so much today, including, let me see, what did I miss?
[03:54:50.316 --> 03:54:53.018]  666 Goldman's latest bonus bears the mark of the beast.
[03:54:53.318 --> 03:54:57.140]  Clause vetoes Czech Republic approval of the Lisbon Treaty.
[03:54:57.580 --> 03:55:01.443]  I just emailed that to Rob D., so I emailed you a copy of the letter that I had gotten from Jim Himes.
[03:55:21.751 --> 03:55:30.159]  He's basically sitting there saying that he's going to vote this down and so on and so forth, but he actually did address that thing in there pertaining to her husband.
[03:55:30.219 --> 03:55:31.099]  I called his office.
[03:55:31.580 --> 03:55:33.982]  Well, whether they're related or not, this is a bad bill.
[03:55:34.022 --> 03:55:35.543]  We should be able to vote on our own.
[03:55:35.883 --> 03:55:36.724]  Oh, it's an awful bill.
[03:55:36.744 --> 03:55:37.145]  You're right.
[03:55:37.285 --> 03:55:40.367]  It's off the charts awful and we do need to oppose it.
[03:55:40.668 --> 03:55:41.829]  I thank you for the call, Bill.
[03:55:42.808 --> 03:55:45.529]  Alan, what are your closing thoughts on this bill?
[03:55:45.549 --> 03:55:47.430]  I mean, a lot of people are obviously concerned.
[03:55:47.950 --> 03:55:51.731]  You know, we don't want Monsanto in charge of our food consumption, do we?
[03:55:53.272 --> 03:55:55.633]  No, but I think, to be honest with you,
[03:55:57.518 --> 03:55:58.218]  It already is.
[03:56:00.079 --> 03:56:10.363]  Monsanto, Archer Daniels Midlands and a few others, there's five of them all together, were set up to take over and be the big agribusiness companies for the entire planet.
[03:56:10.763 --> 03:56:14.185]  They're in every country across the planet, doing the same things at the same time.
[03:56:14.905 --> 03:56:25.309]  And we've had top politicians, prime ministers, come out in Europe saying that they're going to make it, give it a complete go ahead to be GMO, everything GMO,
[03:56:26.283 --> 03:56:35.586]  The United Nations, remember, the Department of Agriculture said when they were set up that their job eventually was to distribute all food across the world to every block.
[03:56:36.186 --> 03:56:38.687]  That's the US block, the European block, etc.
[03:56:39.627 --> 03:56:43.528]  And they said that that will be used as coercion to bring down their populations.
[03:56:43.568 --> 03:56:46.449]  You won't get more rations if you have more populations.
[03:56:46.469 --> 03:56:47.289]  They'll simply reduce it.
[03:56:48.140 --> 03:56:56.484]  Uh, so it's used as a weapon and the woman who was in charge of the UN at that time for that department said that food has always been used as a weapon.
[03:56:56.984 --> 03:57:04.768]  We've got to understand it still is and the old ideas of freedom and being self-sufficient are under the hammer because
[03:57:05.408 --> 03:57:10.809]  In an interdependent world, and what they mean by interdependence is right down to personal interdependence.
[03:57:10.829 --> 03:57:15.190]  It means you will be dependent on them and their system for everything you need to live.
[03:57:15.610 --> 03:57:25.833]  Exactly, no more individualities, no more individual human rights, and that's why they put that in that WHO document, so that they can quarantine you, vaccinate you, and kill you if they want.
[03:57:26.173 --> 03:57:27.033]  That's the bottom line.
[03:57:27.313 --> 03:57:28.694]  Alan Watt, thank you for joining us.
[03:57:28.734 --> 03:57:31.035]  The website is CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com.
[03:57:31.235 --> 03:57:34.076]  Remember, the rebroadcast starts in about 90 seconds.
[03:57:34.096 --> 03:57:36.297]  We talked about the census GPS.
[03:57:36.317 --> 03:57:37.858]  We talked about the flu vaccine.
[03:57:38.078 --> 03:57:43.060]  We talked about the internet dying, the cyber bullying bill, the Cyber Security Act.
[03:57:43.100 --> 03:57:45.902]  We talked about the Bilderberg documents that have recently leaked.
[03:57:46.582 --> 03:57:49.586]  And admit that they created the Euro, folks.
[03:57:49.786 --> 03:57:53.050]  All this stuff and more on the rebroadcast in about 90 seconds.
[03:57:53.090 --> 03:57:58.536]  If you missed any of it, we've got stories at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[03:57:59.337 --> 03:58:01.299]  In this last minute, I want to introduce everybody.
[03:58:01.880 --> 03:58:10.904]  To the latest member of the Prison Planet family, there she is, she's Little Jenny Justice, the Pitbull of PrisonPlanet.tv, and I love her very much.
[03:58:10.964 --> 03:58:14.946]  She guards me by my side when I'm not strapped, folks, and I'm never strapped.
[03:58:14.986 --> 03:58:20.148]  So, again, I do my own little show, 9 to midnight, here at the GCN Network, and I hope you tune in.
[03:58:20.168 --> 03:58:22.469]  We're going to be covering all this and more, taking your phone calls.
[03:58:22.829 --> 03:58:24.650]  I'm Jason Burma, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:58:24.950 --> 03:58:25.851]  God bless you all!
[03:58:42.698 --> 03:58:47.122]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:47.402 --> 03:58:50.885]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.846 --> 03:58:52.447]  Hello, friends.
[03:58:52.487 --> 03:58:53.428]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.548 --> 03:58:58.192]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:58.292 --> 03:59:01.034]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:01.254 --> 03:59:04.117]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:04.297 --> 03:59:10.142]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[03:59:10.362 --> 03:59:13.344]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:59:13.584 --> 03:59:20.510]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:59:20.570 --> 03:59:23.692]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[03:59:23.872 --> 03:59:24.072]  Call 1-800-409-5633.

[03:59:40.568 --> 03:59:41.009]  Take action today.
[03:59:41.029 --> 03:59:42.811]  The first step is getting storable food.
[03:59:54.782 --> 03:59:59.352]  You're listening to GCN, the world leader in independent talk radio.
