[00:00:00.784 --> 00:00:02.966]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:00:03.547 --> 00:00:06.330]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:25.938]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv simulcasting the radio show in the television dimension, audio and visual.
[00:00:25.978 --> 00:00:26.898]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:30.219]  Congressman Dan Hamburg has still agreed to come on with us today.
[00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.160]  He's a little bit under the weather.
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.521]  So we're just going to do about 20-30 minutes with him and then go back to your phone calls and cover all the news.
[00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:36.662]  The reason I wanted to have him on
[00:00:37.282 --> 00:00:56.496]  Is that he wrote some big op-ed pieces and publications, like the San Francisco Chronicle, detailing PDD 51, the FEMA camps, his analysis was dead on, right in line with ours, and he was worried that this whole apparatus would be passed on after Bush left, because let's face it, presidents have become ceremonial to a great extent.
[00:00:57.236 --> 00:01:00.338]  Whereas I would love to believe Obama really was going to fix things.
[00:01:00.378 --> 00:01:00.939]  I have children.
[00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:09.845]  Whereas I would really love to believe that everything was okay and get happy about equality in our first black president, I'm not here to be suckered or be conned.
[00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:14.448]  And I know that he's bringing in the worst of the Clinton people, the worst of the Bush people are staying on.
[00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:25.016]  The banker bailout bill gave immunity to the bankers, $8.5 trillion has been stolen according to multiple publications, Bloomberg, AP, San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:01:26.517 --> 00:01:28.759]  And it's been eight weeks since we learned the new numbers.
[00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.124]  That was in the first month and a half they stole over a trillion three hundred billion.
[00:01:35.144 --> 00:01:36.945]  Hard to get your mind around numbers that big.
[00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:43.270]  And now they're setting up an open world bank run by the bankers, so the ones that engineered all this.
[00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.872]  Obama is run by Wall Street.
[00:01:45.112 --> 00:01:47.914]  I mean, I said you can't vote for McCain, you can't vote for Obama.
[00:01:48.634 --> 00:01:51.297]  But I agree with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, who was a big Reaganite,
[00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:58.439]  That he said he was voting for Obama, and I couldn't say he was bad, because he said, I have to repudiate George Bush.
[00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.225]  The torture, the secret arrest, the police state, the lying about wars, the lying about WMD.
[00:02:04.326 --> 00:02:05.747]  So he said, I'm voting for Obama, and I said, well...
[00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:07.934]  He's ended up being just as bad.
[00:02:07.954 --> 00:02:10.618]  And Robert said, well probably so, but it's a message to the world.
[00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.222]  But I said, well what about after Obama gets in and it all continues?
[00:02:13.242 --> 00:02:14.484]  He goes, well that remains to be seen.
[00:02:14.945 --> 00:02:19.652]  He was on a few weeks ago and he said, Alex, even before he was inaugurated, or right after, he said, I think you were right.
[00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:21.675]  Looks like it's just as bad or worse.
[00:02:22.256 --> 00:02:25.738]  Because now the people are suckered by the slickness, the intelligence.
[00:02:26.258 --> 00:02:30.461]  I mean, Bush was insulting, up there bumbling and stuttering and making up words.
[00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:38.345]  Obama, you know, he comes across as genuine, he's cool, he wears his hat backwards and, you know, does the hang ten, you know, surfing stuff.
[00:02:38.605 --> 00:02:39.786]  He's slick, he's cool!
[00:02:41.447 --> 00:02:44.268]  Well, so are a lot of other psychopaths, silver-tongued.
[00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:47.622]  That's why I'm making the Obama deception.
[00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:54.225]  But, Congressman Hamburger, I wanted to get you on to go over all of this, and welcome to the show.
[00:02:54.785 --> 00:02:55.746]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:02:56.006 --> 00:02:59.748]  And, you know, I'm a big fan of Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:02:59.988 --> 00:03:06.131]  I try to read everything that I see that comes out on the net that he writes.
[00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:13.634]  And I have to say that I mostly share your perception.
[00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:14.555]  I don't think Obama
[00:03:15.342 --> 00:03:23.168]  He's a psychopath, but I'd sure like to know what he was doing when he went to work for Business International Corporation after he left Columbia.
[00:03:23.768 --> 00:03:27.591]  Because there's still something about Barack Obama.
[00:03:28.632 --> 00:03:40.921]  And you know, I hate to be a naysayer, because so many of my friends and even colleagues and people I respect are riding this Obama wave.
[00:03:41.041 --> 00:03:43.543]  And I don't want to be the skunk at the garden party.
[00:03:44.284 --> 00:03:50.268]  But at the same time, you know, you look at so many things that are going on.
[00:03:50.348 --> 00:04:02.916]  As you mentioned, the retreads from Clinton, the retreads from Bush, the way this economic crisis is being handled, which seems more like a heist than a stimulus.
[00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:09.620]  When you look at the continuation of the Extraordinary Rendition Program, you look at the continuation
[00:04:11.576 --> 00:04:14.458]  Of camps that, you know, Guantanamo closed it in a year.
[00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.880]  Well, you know, I think they ought to close it in 24 hours.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.360]  I don't know why it takes a year.
[00:04:20.481 --> 00:04:22.002]  You know, it didn't take a year to open it.
[00:04:22.202 --> 00:04:23.442]  It shouldn't take a year to close it.
[00:04:23.823 --> 00:04:29.205]  But putting that aside, Bagram Air Force Base, you know, they're doing the same thing there.
[00:04:29.245 --> 00:04:30.506]  They're doing it in Guantanamo.
[00:04:32.107 --> 00:04:34.148]  They're doing the same thing at U.S.
[00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:38.770]  military bases in Iraq, which seem to me to still be
[00:04:40.988 --> 00:04:47.553]  Not enduring bases, as they used to call them, but permanent military installations as part of the American Empire.
[00:04:48.333 --> 00:05:01.683]  And as I heard pointed out in the media last week, Barack Obama is now in charge of the biggest military machine in the history of the planet, by far.
[00:05:01.823 --> 00:05:06.487]  He is now the one who has responsibility for the American Empire.
[00:05:07.114 --> 00:05:20.366]  And he better start acting like he understands the undemocratic and profoundly negative aspect of that.
[00:05:20.466 --> 00:05:34.078]  And he doesn't really seem to have any understanding that he is now the ruler of an empire, he is now the ruler of a country that supplies more arms around the world than
[00:05:34.676 --> 00:05:39.377]  than any other country on the face of the Earth and in the history of the planet Earth.
[00:05:40.337 --> 00:05:52.040]  And, you know, I think this is going to be a pretty limp-wristed administration, if what we've seen so far is an indication of what's to come.
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.281]  Well, Congressman, I want you to, but let me throw in some points here.
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:08.168]  If you look at what Barack Obama's really doing, he's a slick pitchman, but a military industrial complex owned by offshore banks that big isn't going to let him get in.
[00:06:08.648 --> 00:06:11.931]  Isn't going to give him more money than any presidential candidate was ever given.
[00:06:12.251 --> 00:06:18.296]  Four or five times, depending on which numbers you look at, in Wall Street money than John McCain got.
[00:06:18.536 --> 00:06:22.840]  His administration filled with the very bankers that have engineered this collapse.
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.857]  And they're now amassing more power, terrorizing people saying, give us unlimited power or there'll be a depression.
[00:06:30.662 --> 00:06:32.924]  In hindsight, it's doing Obama a favor.
[00:06:33.505 --> 00:06:37.688]  And that's the approach I have in the Obama deception of going, look, forget this guy.
[00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:39.950]  Look at who's in control.
[00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.712]  That's who we need to blame.
[00:06:41.952 --> 00:06:45.755]  If we always get distracted, and I did this, I pointed out Bush was a distraction.
[00:06:45.775 --> 00:06:46.596]  He was evil and horrible.
[00:06:46.616 --> 00:06:47.537]  He should be brought to justice.
[00:06:47.857 --> 00:06:49.798]  But still, what about those pulling his strings?
[00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:50.819]  What about his handlers?
[00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:58.246]  Let's look past Barack Obama and George Bush and look at the real power structure, and it's the very same people now filling the ranks.
[00:06:59.106 --> 00:07:03.590]  So comment on that, A. And then, B, on the rendition, the kidnapping.
[00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:15.099]  It says, under executive orders issued by Obama recently, the CIA still has the authority to carry out what are known as renditions, secret abductions and transfers of prisoners to countries that cooperate with the United States.
[00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:16.099]  So it's a bait-and-switch.
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:23.385]  I mean, I've been reading what the legal scholars are saying, even liberals, who are kind of halfway wanting to, well, they're going to take them to secret camps.
[00:07:24.105 --> 00:07:24.346]  So, A,
[00:07:26.385 --> 00:07:28.586]  Everything's being put on Obama, and I believe it's going to be a trap.
[00:07:28.606 --> 00:07:32.388]  They're going to destroy him in the end, after he's served his usefulness politically.
[00:07:32.908 --> 00:07:37.491]  And then B, still allowing the abductions and taking them to secret client countries?
[00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:40.852]  Well, you know, it's way beyond creepy.
[00:07:41.673 --> 00:07:53.799]  And, you know, when you hear the justification from it in the mainstream press, led by the New York Times and the Washington Post, you know, the justification is, well, we have to
[00:07:54.304 --> 00:07:58.667]  Keep these tools in our national tool bag for fighting terrorism.
[00:07:59.447 --> 00:08:07.253]  Well, you know, even people like Chris Matthews on MSNBC are starting to understand that you don't fight a war on terrorism.
[00:08:07.673 --> 00:08:08.954]  Terrorism is a tactic.
[00:08:09.014 --> 00:08:12.556]  It has nothing to do with an enemy.
[00:08:13.157 --> 00:08:19.461]  And when you try to put your finger on who the enemy is, you run into the fact that Al-Qaeda itself
[00:08:20.191 --> 00:08:25.853]  It's a mythological organization, and to the extent there is an Al-Qaeda, it was created by the CIA.
[00:08:26.874 --> 00:08:33.916]  So, I mean, there are so many subterfuges within subterfuges within subterfuges, and you're right.
[00:08:34.436 --> 00:08:41.999]  The American people are being hoodwinked, they're being led around like sheep, and for what purpose?
[00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:46.341]  Well, it seems like the purpose is the same as it ever was, which is to rob
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.101]  Uh, the great majority of us, in order to feed the rich.
[00:08:50.682 --> 00:08:57.945]  And that's what our economic system has been about for many, many decades, if not a couple of centuries.
[00:08:59.806 --> 00:09:07.169]  And until people understand that, you know, I don't see anything really positive happening for the United States of America.
[00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:19.033]  Except we're going to kind of, while we go down the road to hell, they're kind of giving us laughing gas to feel euphoric about Obama and he says he cares about us and he says he wants us to, you know, work with him.
[00:09:19.713 --> 00:09:24.095]  Going back to an editorial you wrote, I guess about a year and a half ago, about Bush and how
[00:09:24.935 --> 00:09:32.802]  The whole apparatus of the police state and the FEMA camps and PDD 51 and John Warner Defense Authorization Act, it was all aimed at us.
[00:09:33.282 --> 00:09:41.690]  Now we're seeing it in the news that they're arresting people for marijuana, they're arresting people for talking back on airplanes, they're charging them under the Patriot Act, and it's all continuing
[00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:45.995]  Well, it's sort of like what Bill Clinton pulled when he came into office.
[00:10:01.281 --> 00:10:07.384]  And was able to get all this legislation passed, and everybody said, geez, the Republicans never could have ended welfare.
[00:10:07.684 --> 00:10:09.866]  The Republicans never could have gotten NAFTA passed.
[00:10:09.926 --> 00:10:12.167]  The Republicans never could have gotten that crime bill through.
[00:10:12.947 --> 00:10:20.151]  So the Democrats, you know, come in and actualize the Republicans' fondest dreams.
[00:10:22.512 --> 00:10:28.876]  Obama, as you said, is a very slick character, and it's like having Will Smith as president.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.083]  People just can't help but love him, and the wife, and the babies, and it's such a pretty picture.
[00:10:35.103 --> 00:10:41.748]  It's going to suck people along for a while, but the piper will be paid.
[00:10:42.648 --> 00:10:51.054]  If a year from now this economy is even more cratered than it is now, all of a sudden it's going to be blaming on the black man.
[00:10:54.537 --> 00:11:08.596]  You know, I can see some very ugly scenarios down the road, and I think the only way you combat it is to wake up America and get people to entertain the idea that they're being fooled.
[00:11:10.114 --> 00:11:12.696]  Well, Congressman, finish up after the break.
[00:11:12.716 --> 00:11:14.196]  We're about to go to break, but I agree with you.
[00:11:14.537 --> 00:11:23.162]  And that's what, you know, when I talk to people like KRS-One, or I talk to other, you know, well-known hip-hop, rap icons, that's what they're concerned about, because they know what's going on.
[00:11:23.402 --> 00:11:26.344]  They know he's the front man, and they know in the end this is a trap.
[00:11:26.724 --> 00:11:29.566]  And that's why, in a way, I'm doing Barack Obama a favor.
[00:11:29.826 --> 00:11:32.628]  The public needs to know, this guy, love him or hate him.
[00:11:33.728 --> 00:11:35.430]  You think he's the messiah or you think he's the devil?
[00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:36.771]  You need to understand something.
[00:11:37.051 --> 00:11:38.112]  He is a front man.
[00:11:38.733 --> 00:11:43.957]  And two weeks into his administration, we know it's business as usual with just a little bit of pat-on-the-head rhetoric.
[00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.741]  So I want to get your take on that and talk about solutions and where you see this going.
[00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:56.127]  And then the FEMA camp legislation openly introduced and they say these FEMA camps are basically going to take over local government.
[00:11:56.528 --> 00:11:57.108]  Stay with us.
[00:11:57.448 --> 00:11:59.070]  Former Congressman Dan Hamburg is our guest.
[00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.431]  We'll give you his website when we come back.
[00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:03.482]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:12:03.883 --> 00:12:09.368]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:10.449]  That's right.
[00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.653]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:12:14.454 --> 00:12:20.520]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:12:21.089 --> 00:12:28.772]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:12:29.212 --> 00:12:34.074]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:12:34.694 --> 00:12:39.716]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:12:40.496 --> 00:12:44.618]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:12:45.018 --> 00:12:45.278]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:50.048]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:12:50.348 --> 00:12:50.628]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:12:50.648 --> 00:12:50.848]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:10.970]  But who is the enemy?
[00:13:11.511 --> 00:13:11.991]  Bin Laden.
[00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:13.292]  This is his M.O.
[00:13:13.313 --> 00:13:14.654]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:13:14.674 --> 00:13:16.276]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:13:16.656 --> 00:13:23.423]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:13:23.823 --> 00:13:24.244]  Some U.S.
[00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:29.970]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:34.153]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:13:34.513 --> 00:13:44.381]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:13:44.622 --> 00:13:45.362]  Fabled enemies.

[00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:56.952]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:14:00.834 --> 00:14:04.475]  When times get tough, we must all decide what's most important in life.
[00:14:04.795 --> 00:14:09.816]  At EnduringRose.com, we believe that lasting relationships are what make life most meaningful.
[00:14:10.256 --> 00:14:14.537]  Showing our loved ones that we care is what helps us find happiness in an uncertain world.
[00:14:15.077 --> 00:14:16.378]  Enduring Rose can help.
[00:14:16.738 --> 00:14:22.879]  We have taken real roses, the universal symbols of love, and coated them in eternal and precious 24 karat gold.
[00:14:23.319 --> 00:14:26.820]  These roses, forever preserved in either white or yellow gold, will never
[00:14:29.292 --> 00:14:29.552]  I think so.
[00:14:48.251 --> 00:14:53.158]  That's E-N-D-U-R-I-N-G Rose and duringrose.com or call 702-453-7455.
[00:14:53.179 --> 00:14:53.559]  That's 702-453-7455.
[00:15:00.157 --> 00:15:04.760]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:12.285]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[00:15:12.525 --> 00:15:13.906]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:15:14.146 --> 00:15:18.029]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:15:18.309 --> 00:15:21.872]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:15:22.132 --> 00:15:26.234]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:15:26.615 --> 00:15:30.077]  Phase One is a One World Currency which we are currently being prepared to
[00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:31.498]  We're good to go.
[00:16:06.803 --> 00:16:07.763]  We're back live.
[00:16:07.823 --> 00:16:10.525]  Congressman Dan Hemberg is our guest.
[00:16:10.625 --> 00:16:12.345]  Keeping with us for about 40 after.
[00:16:12.365 --> 00:16:14.907]  Then I'm going directly to all of you that have been patiently holding.
[00:16:15.207 --> 00:16:16.207]  Call for your number to join us.
[00:16:16.227 --> 00:16:17.488]  1-800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:28.753]  Make no mistake, this is the globalists making their move against free society right now.
[00:16:29.453 --> 00:16:33.615]  Using the crises they have orchestrated to bring in even greater control.
[00:16:33.735 --> 00:16:44.681]  Foreign offshore banks are openly not just heisting, not just robbing the treasuries of the world, not just the United States, not just the West, but they're making their moves on third world countries.
[00:16:45.612 --> 00:16:47.473]  That's what they did to third world countries over and over again.
[00:16:47.493 --> 00:16:48.454]  They're now doing to us.
[00:16:48.894 --> 00:16:50.475]  It is an inside job.
[00:16:51.376 --> 00:16:53.337]  Congressman Hamburg.
[00:16:55.535 --> 00:17:07.666]  Getting into the FEMA camps, getting into the situation there, getting into Obama's youth corps and forced civilian service, Rahm Emanuel's brainchild.
[00:17:08.727 --> 00:17:11.569]  They're now announcing a civilian military.
[00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:13.391]  The bill has been introduced.
[00:17:13.451 --> 00:17:16.333]  That's in my stack of news as well.
[00:17:17.554 --> 00:17:19.356]  Break down any concerns you've got about that.
[00:17:20.134 --> 00:17:25.357]  Well, um, I have to tell you, Alex, that, um, I caught the Corbett Report last week.
[00:17:27.278 --> 00:17:30.120]  And, uh, they had, uh, quite a segment with you.
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.401]  Were you aware of that?
[00:17:33.121 --> 00:17:33.322]  No.
[00:17:34.142 --> 00:17:49.851]  Well, the Corbett Report, you know, you wear the Corbett Report, comes out of Japan, and, um, they had a segment of, you know, of you on the air, and they were talking about precisely this issue, which is this cult of Obama.
[00:17:50.586 --> 00:18:07.857]  And this idea that we're all pledging, you know, not to our communities, but to Obama as the, you know, sort of the new, the new, I don't want to say Führer, but sort of like that, you know, it's a cult of personality.
[00:18:09.058 --> 00:18:13.001]  And I find it, I think everybody should find it very alarming.
[00:18:13.741 --> 00:18:17.304]  You know, this country is not about individual heroes.
[00:18:17.404 --> 00:18:19.385]  This country is about, you know,
[00:18:20.017 --> 00:18:22.939]  Wasn't there something in our Constitution about we the people?
[00:18:23.839 --> 00:18:41.870]  But, you know, we're getting away from that because things are at such a state that, and the people are so enamored of Brethren Circuses that, you know, they need this symbolic presence of, you know, the great leader that we're now all going to pay homage to.
[00:18:42.571 --> 00:18:48.014]  And I find it disgusting, but more than that, I find it very dangerous.
[00:18:49.146 --> 00:18:51.507]  I also find this new H.R.
[00:18:51.527 --> 00:18:53.808]  645 alarming.
[00:18:53.828 --> 00:18:59.631]  It's the National Emergency Center's Establishment Act, introduced in the House as H.R.
[00:18:59.971 --> 00:19:03.593]  645 by a man named Alfie Hastings of Florida.
[00:19:04.353 --> 00:19:17.880]  And, you know, I served with Alfie Hastings, very nice gentleman, but there's one interesting thing about him, which was that when he was a federal judge in Florida, he barely escaped
[00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:29.486]  In fact, I think he did lose his judgeship on corruption charges, and shortly thereafter was able to win a seat in the House.
[00:19:29.626 --> 00:19:34.410]  But, you know, I was wondering, well, why is Alfie Hastings the one who's introducing this resolution?
[00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:44.337]  And a colleague of mine, Peter Dale Scott, who you may have heard of, he's written, you know, extensively... Interviewed him many times, interviewed him last week.
[00:19:44.637 --> 00:19:48.020]  Anyway, Peter Dale Scott's take on this is, well, of course it would be Alfie Hastings.
[00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.331]  You know, they've got so much crap on L.C.
[00:19:50.351 --> 00:19:59.873]  Hastings that he's, you know, they can tell him to introduce a bill to, you know, to do anything, and he'll do it, because they've got plenty on him.
[00:20:00.613 --> 00:20:05.275]  But if you read through this bill, it's very alarming.
[00:20:05.335 --> 00:20:17.018]  It's establishing six FEMA camps around the United States on military bases, and to me, the best commentary I've read on this so far
[00:20:17.594 --> 00:20:28.023]  Was the commentary made by Congressman Ron Paul, who pointed out that the fact that they're doing this on a military basis... Well, let me just read something off his blog.
[00:20:28.724 --> 00:20:44.377]  He says, even though we know that detention facilities are already in place, they now want to legalize the construction of FEMA camps on military installations, using the ever-popular excuse that the facilities are for the purpose of national emergency.
[00:20:45.086 --> 00:20:54.991]  National emergency centers will be used in a national emergency, but only if the emergency requires large groups of people to be rounded up and detained.
[00:20:55.592 --> 00:21:04.376]  If that isn't the case, asks Paul, then why have these national emergency facilities, why are they being built in military installations?
[00:21:04.857 --> 00:21:08.118]  And it's a very, it's a very interesting point.
[00:21:09.979 --> 00:21:12.801]  And it should really make people worried.
[00:21:13.288 --> 00:21:23.941]  They're taking these bases and turning them into centers that they can move people to, where they can be effectively contained.
[00:21:25.276 --> 00:21:29.299]  For long periods of time, if you read through the legislation... Congressman, stay there!
[00:21:29.599 --> 00:21:29.879]  Stay there.
[00:21:29.899 --> 00:21:30.860]  I don't want you to be cut off.
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.861]  Come back and start over on that point.
[00:21:32.961 --> 00:21:36.644]  And I particularly have been studying similar legislation for a long time.
[00:21:37.364 --> 00:21:44.149]  I want to connect a few dots when we come back with you and get your take on that because you were in Congress and you know what type of chance it has of passing.
[00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.171]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:46.591 --> 00:21:49.673]  They've also got a bunch of bills that effectively ban most guns in the country.
[00:21:49.973 --> 00:21:50.434]  Introduced.
[00:21:50.714 --> 00:21:51.594]  We're on the march.
[00:21:52.095 --> 00:21:53.596]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:54.608 --> 00:21:57.389]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.051]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[00:22:04.291 --> 00:22:06.652]  How would you like to be debt-free in 90 days?
[00:22:06.772 --> 00:22:07.432]  Guaranteed!

[00:22:22.697 --> 00:22:23.137]  We're good to go.
[00:22:46.516 --> 00:22:47.017]  We're good to go.
[00:23:00.589 --> 00:23:02.611]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:23:02.731 --> 00:23:05.134]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:23:05.154 --> 00:23:07.376]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:23:07.416 --> 00:23:08.958]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:23:08.978 --> 00:23:10.579]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.502]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:23:13.522 --> 00:23:17.226]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR.
[00:23:26.873 --> 00:23:31.658]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:23:31.738 --> 00:23:32.819]  An inside job.
[00:23:35.513 --> 00:23:36.874]  How dare you?
[00:23:37.954 --> 00:23:43.036]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:23:43.196 --> 00:23:45.837]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:23:45.937 --> 00:23:52.360]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:23:57.502 --> 00:23:59.963]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:24:00.618 --> 00:24:03.560]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:08.944]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:24:09.244 --> 00:24:14.588]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:24:14.948 --> 00:24:16.089]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:24:16.429 --> 00:24:25.315]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[00:24:25.755 --> 00:24:27.376]  Now, compare a Calbin Pure Soap.

[00:25:29.829 --> 00:25:30.710]  Again and again.
[00:25:34.052 --> 00:25:37.694]  We're coming straight on for the New World Order.
[00:25:37.714 --> 00:25:42.417]  I don't know if we're going to win this thing, but I know this.
[00:25:42.457 --> 00:25:43.077]  We're in the fight.
[00:25:43.618 --> 00:25:44.358]  We're in the arena.
[00:25:45.259 --> 00:25:46.660]  And we are not giving in.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.520]  We're not giving up.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.582]  We're not giving in to fear, intimidation, none of it.
[00:25:50.742 --> 00:25:51.543]  We're going straight on.
[00:25:53.655 --> 00:25:57.357]  Alright, former congressman is our guest, Dan Hamburg.
[00:25:57.377 --> 00:26:01.120]  And we're going to let him go here in about 12 minutes or so.
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:04.962]  I'll go back to your phone calls and then go through a bunch of the news I haven't even gotten into yet.
[00:26:05.783 --> 00:26:12.907]  We were talking about, and you were reading a quote from Ron Paul, about how serious this is.
[00:26:12.927 --> 00:26:15.789]  If you read the bill,
[00:26:17.685 --> 00:26:21.628]  The FEMA camp bill, it states they'll have clergy in their local communities.
[00:26:22.429 --> 00:26:24.690]  And I've been studying the building of these FEMA camps.
[00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.111]  There's scores of them around the nation.
[00:26:26.211 --> 00:26:27.612]  It's been in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:26:27.993 --> 00:26:29.834]  So it's kind of like the warrantless spying.
[00:26:30.274 --> 00:26:36.959]  They warrantlessly spy on you and then when they get caught, then they try to pass bills to legalize it.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.081]  And so what they've done is
[00:26:40.345 --> 00:26:43.946]  Reverse engineering, it's everything I covered in my police state films, articles we've written.
[00:26:44.306 --> 00:26:48.508]  The clergy response teams we first discovered with the secret FEMA documents the pastors got to us.
[00:26:48.948 --> 00:26:49.768]  Nobody believed us.
[00:26:50.168 --> 00:26:51.469]  We were attacked in national news.
[00:26:51.489 --> 00:26:53.649]  A year and a half later it came out in the news, it was true.
[00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:56.350]  It mentions the clergy on the camps.
[00:26:56.410 --> 00:27:04.833]  Now they're trained to tell their local flocks to go to the camps, to turn in their guns, to take force inoculations, to let them take their children away, to other facilities for their safety.
[00:27:06.007 --> 00:27:08.389]  So you see these innocuous lines in there, you know what it means.
[00:27:08.809 --> 00:27:27.641]  Also, these threat fusions, FEMA centers, they're building separate command centers in every city and then in even rural areas in the counties, where the local police departments, it'll even be two or three counties or several cities, move into one building with the feds and the National Guard, which has now been federalized under
[00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:35.592]  What Homeland Security has openly announced, 20,000 regular troops to be on the streets, the National Guard to now be totally federal.
[00:27:35.952 --> 00:27:40.615]  Governors, it says, serve at their pleasure as dual-hatted officers of the U.S.
[00:27:40.695 --> 00:27:41.236]  military.
[00:27:42.216 --> 00:27:50.202]  And so this is a NORTHCOM military dictatorship over the United States with clergy response teams and other community leaders.
[00:27:50.622 --> 00:27:54.925]  They're controlling the population, telling them that they can trust the military.
[00:27:55.905 --> 00:27:58.887]  Now, I mean, that's like right out of Red Dawn or something.
[00:27:58.907 --> 00:28:03.331]  That's really what happened in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany and East Germany under Mao Zedong.
[00:28:03.371 --> 00:28:06.933]  This is the classic, most hardcore system.
[00:28:07.414 --> 00:28:13.278]  In Germany, they had clergy leaders and others tell people to go to the work camps for their safety.
[00:28:14.139 --> 00:28:17.041]  You know, they don't announce this is a concentration camp or even a death camp.
[00:28:17.301 --> 00:28:18.622]  They go, oh, it's for your safety.
[00:28:18.642 --> 00:28:19.683]  Well, there's been some rioting.
[00:28:19.963 --> 00:28:24.487]  So with that background, Congressman Hamburg, can you specifically speak to what I was just talking about?
[00:28:26.229 --> 00:28:41.213]  Well, you know, again, one of the things that Ron Paul points out is that in Iceland and Greece, we have already had citizen riots in response to the economic meltdowns that are occurring.
[00:28:42.374 --> 00:28:53.017]  And of course, the last time I was on with you, it was the day after Representative Brad Sherman had stood up on the House floor
[00:28:53.935 --> 00:29:13.722]  And I think in a one-minute speech he had talked about how he had been warned by administration officials, and this was later corroborated by, I think it was Senator Imhoff, that threats were actually being made that martial law could be instituted if the bailout bills weren't passed.
[00:29:14.163 --> 00:29:20.745]  So we've got that, we've got what you mentioned about the battle-hardened brigades
[00:29:21.401 --> 00:29:23.462]  Uh, now being stationed in the United States.
[00:29:23.482 --> 00:29:28.384]  There's a brigade now, I believe they're still stationed in Georgia, although they may have been moved to Colorado.
[00:29:28.944 --> 00:29:50.612]  And plans, uh, uh, currently being implemented to install two more brigades of, uh, of soldiers who are trained in, uh, containing civil unrest and, uh, checkpointing, uh, transportation facilities and, you know, basically, uh, dealing with, uh, civilian disorder.
[00:29:51.334 --> 00:29:52.295]  Locking down cities.
[00:29:52.335 --> 00:29:54.076]  Let me just add the caveat to back you up.
[00:29:54.637 --> 00:29:57.940]  This third brigade, and now they've actually expanded it to four.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.383]  And then suddenly they're saying maybe they're going to double that in a year.
[00:30:01.463 --> 00:30:01.703]  So it's 20,000, 40,000.
[00:30:02.003 --> 00:30:04.906]  They've got to be combat ready, they're saying.
[00:30:06.027 --> 00:30:11.191]  The Army War College came out and said that their new mission is engaging the American people for civil unrest.
[00:30:11.211 --> 00:30:14.774]  Police agencies announced, like Phoenix, we're ready to do battle with you.
[00:30:15.355 --> 00:30:17.757]  So just amazing declarations, really a war
[00:30:18.397 --> 00:30:37.061]  against the people and this third brigade is the cream of the army from Fallujah, from areas of Baghdad, where as you just said, where they lock people down, so they have done the raids in homes, the gun confiscations, they are bringing the cream as the cadre to train the other brigades.
[00:30:37.721 --> 00:30:38.561]  Please comment on that.
[00:30:39.981 --> 00:30:45.443]  Well, I'm not sure what to say about it, it's very frightening.
[00:30:45.683 --> 00:30:47.323]  Another thing I want to throw in there
[00:30:48.015 --> 00:31:13.771]  Is that since at least September 14, 2001, a few days after the so-called 9-11 terrorist attack, the United States has been under a state of national emergency, which allows the federal government to put into place these continuity of government provisions, which allow for martial law to be instituted.
[00:31:14.272 --> 00:31:15.572]  Now, the last time
[00:31:16.912 --> 00:31:22.555]  That state of national emergency was reinstituted, was on August 28th of 2008.
[00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:35.503]  I have heard nothing that indicates to me, and I keep looking for it and I keep asking about it, that that state of emergency has been rescinded by President Obama.
[00:31:36.143 --> 00:31:46.589]  As far as I know, this country is now in its, well I guess it's still the seventh year, but getting close to the eighth year of a continuous
[00:31:47.253 --> 00:31:55.115]  Continually reinstituted on an annual basis, State of National Emergency.
[00:31:55.855 --> 00:32:11.318]  The Congress, when a State of National Emergency is declared under United States law, Congress is supposed to reconsider that State of Emergency on a six month basis and either rescind it or continue it.
[00:32:11.898 --> 00:32:15.379]  That has never occurred and we're talking about now
[00:32:16.175 --> 00:32:17.635]  You know, seven or eight years.
[00:32:18.656 --> 00:32:45.801]  So, for people to believe that this country is operating in a democratic framework when we're under a state of emergency with continuity of government procedures in effect and brigades of the Northern Command within the continental United States with posse comitatus basically having been, you know, thrown out the window with a continuation of rendition and, you know, all the rest of this stuff, you know,
[00:32:46.941 --> 00:32:57.940]  I don't know what people are smoking, but they should start to wake up and smell the reality of what we're dealing with here.
[00:32:59.062 --> 00:33:03.385]  Congressman, I'm always impressed by how informed you are.
[00:33:03.826 --> 00:33:15.915]  Probably next to Ron Paul, you're about the only person I get on air who is always aware of every point I bring up, every news article I bring up, because I'm constantly trying to keep track three, four hours a day, and I don't find half the stuff.
[00:33:15.935 --> 00:33:19.578]  You know, I find it later, and I'm always angry, because so much bad is happening.
[00:33:19.778 --> 00:33:21.379]  People think I'm putting a bad face on things.
[00:33:21.419 --> 00:33:27.284]  No, it's far worse than I always predict, looking at the evidence, than it turns out it really was.
[00:33:29.005 --> 00:33:51.958]  That said, did you see one of the former, did you see the article where one of the former Fed Governors told Bloomberg that other Fed members he knows that are on the Board of Governors now are calling the New York Fed and the private Federal Reserve Board and saying let us know what's happening with the bailout and they tell them War Powers Act has been enacted
[00:33:53.174 --> 00:33:57.595]  We are under martial law, and so we don't even have to tell you that.
[00:33:58.195 --> 00:34:10.439]  And then that dovetails with Congressman Sherman and others we've interviewed here, and Senator Inhofe, on record, saying that they were threatened with physical martial law on October 1st, 2nd, and 3rd if they didn't pass the bailout.
[00:34:10.499 --> 00:34:16.101]  So clearly, with that national emergency, integrated with the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, PDD 51,
[00:34:17.661 --> 00:34:28.264]  enemy, combatant designations, the Military Commissions Act, with all of this nexusing in, we are under the military dictatorship of NORTHCOM.
[00:34:28.344 --> 00:34:29.664]  I mean, there's no other way to cut it.
[00:34:31.045 --> 00:34:37.847]  No, and it's in direct violation of statutes that have been part of this country for 200 years.
[00:34:38.687 --> 00:34:45.749]  But, unfortunately, the great majority of our population is blissfully unaware, and what we need is a
[00:34:47.702 --> 00:35:07.967]  There's a huge number of Paul Revere's out there riding around saying that the fascists have come and they have alighted in our cities and our towns and they are robbing this country of whatever hope of liberty that we ever hope to exercise as citizens.
[00:35:09.667 --> 00:35:16.209]  I just hope there's more programs like yours out there and that people will start to wake up.
[00:35:17.421 --> 00:35:21.907]  As one of our great patriots said, eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.
[00:35:23.149 --> 00:35:27.414]  Without an informed public, democracy is dead.
[00:35:28.175 --> 00:35:31.399]  Well, I agree with you and Congressman, in the last few minutes we have with you.
[00:35:33.182 --> 00:35:34.644]  Let's put the cherry on top here.
[00:35:37.008 --> 00:35:38.230]  We're under the War Powers Act.
[00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.171]  We're under NORTHCOM.
[00:35:40.092 --> 00:35:42.696]  Previously, they would have a CENTCOM.
[00:35:43.638 --> 00:35:45.200]  They would have a SOUTHCOM.
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:49.626]  They would have areas that were under the military control in the empire.
[00:35:50.227 --> 00:35:53.311]  And now we have NORTHCOM over the heart of the empire, the homeland.
[00:35:53.752 --> 00:35:54.793]  I mean, look at all these terms.
[00:35:54.813 --> 00:35:55.754]  Look at the nomenclature.
[00:35:55.794 --> 00:35:57.476]  This is a long strategic program.
[00:35:57.696 --> 00:36:02.662]  We know these FEMA camps didn't just pop up this week as they're saying, oh, for the economic emergency.
[00:36:02.922 --> 00:36:08.989]  They've been slowly preparing for this for decades with the shadow government, the parallel government, the national security government.
[00:36:10.129 --> 00:36:13.391]  The National Security Dictatorship that Peter Dale Scott talks so much about.
[00:36:13.851 --> 00:36:15.692]  Isn't Obama the cherry on top?
[00:36:15.732 --> 00:36:16.773]  The messianic leader.
[00:36:16.953 --> 00:36:17.853]  We're in a crisis.
[00:36:17.873 --> 00:36:19.274]  This unpopular president has left.
[00:36:19.594 --> 00:36:20.315]  He comes in.
[00:36:20.395 --> 00:36:20.955]  He's slick.
[00:36:21.015 --> 00:36:21.555]  He loves us.
[00:36:21.595 --> 00:36:22.095]  He cares.
[00:36:22.416 --> 00:36:23.916]  But he needs dictatorial power.
[00:36:24.236 --> 00:36:25.337]  They're putting up billboards.
[00:36:25.377 --> 00:36:30.760]  They're running government PSAs about him, like he's God, saying join his USA.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.321]  Well, who could do it better?
[00:36:32.341 --> 00:36:35.423]  It would have to be somebody who met the qualifications.
[00:37:01.758 --> 00:37:03.198]  The way that Barack Obama does.
[00:37:03.298 --> 00:37:13.260]  And again, I think anyone with a critical mind has to ask themselves, where did this man come from?
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:25.902]  You know, as wonderful as he appears and intelligent and all the rest, you don't go from the Illinois State Senate to the President of the United States unless you've got some very extraordinary backing.
[00:37:26.822 --> 00:37:30.803]  And there was somewhere along the line in the Barack Obama story, and again, I go back
[00:37:31.707 --> 00:37:35.789]  Business International Corporation, which is where Obama went after Columbia.
[00:37:36.329 --> 00:37:39.690]  Which, you know, you can look it up in Wikipedia and they'll tell you it's the CIA front.
[00:37:40.031 --> 00:37:47.474]  There was some point at which Obama was recruited and trained to be a certain type of political figure.
[00:37:47.594 --> 00:37:57.638]  And I'm not saying that when they trained him, you know, back, you know, when he had just finished undergraduate school, before he even went to Harvard, that they knew that he would be this person.
[00:37:57.678 --> 00:38:00.099]  I think the CIA recruits and trains
[00:38:01.063 --> 00:38:10.986]  Scores, if not hundreds of young people for these types of jobs, and they don't know exactly who is the one that's going to emerge.
[00:38:11.046 --> 00:38:12.067]  They've got a pool of candidates.
[00:38:12.087 --> 00:38:20.749]  You know, Bill Clinton was recruited by the British CIA Section Chief, who now, from our own research, ran the Kennedy assassination.
[00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:22.890]  And that's now declassified.
[00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:25.251]  So we know Clinton and Hillary were both CIA.
[00:38:25.651 --> 00:38:26.971]  It's funny you bring that up.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.861]  I didn't know this until about a week ago.
[00:38:30.921 --> 00:38:38.303]  Did you know that Obama's first job after college was with Henry Kissinger at Kissinger and Associates?
[00:38:38.623 --> 00:38:39.523]  That's above CIA.
[00:38:39.643 --> 00:38:46.186]  I mean, this is the guy who's kind of the gopher for the ultra-elite over every major president since Richard Nixon.
[00:38:46.226 --> 00:38:55.769]  I mean, can you specifically... I mean, is that a good thing on Obama's resume that the uber gopher of the globalist was his handler out of college?
[00:38:57.099 --> 00:39:01.202]  Well, no, but it tells you a lot about who Barack Obama is.
[00:39:01.982 --> 00:39:13.610]  We saw the confirmation of that when Obama became president, and we watched him pick the people who would surround him in his cabinet.
[00:39:14.271 --> 00:39:22.376]  And a lot of people said, well, he's just got the old LBJ strategy of it's better to have ball inside the tent than outside the tent.
[00:39:24.212 --> 00:39:33.017]  You know, there's just too many globalists, too many corporatists, too many imperialists in the cabinet to make you believe.
[00:39:33.137 --> 00:39:38.359]  I mean, you just have to be a Pollyanna to believe that this is going to end well.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.161]  Congressman, give out your website for folks that want to visit.
[00:39:42.201 --> 00:39:46.103]  Yes, voiceoftheenvironment.org.
[00:39:46.924 --> 00:39:47.984]  Voiceoftheenvironment.org.
[00:39:48.044 --> 00:39:50.686]  We'll put that up on the television screen for folks.
[00:39:51.006 --> 00:39:52.086]  Voiceoftheenvironment.org.
[00:39:52.506 --> 00:39:53.147]  In closing,
[00:39:54.646 --> 00:39:57.128]  You're still pushing to bring Bush to justice.
[00:39:57.188 --> 00:39:58.789]  I mean, that's one of the big things with Obama.
[00:39:59.509 --> 00:40:00.590]  He's not saying a peep.
[00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:15.440]  In fact, in his speech after he was sworn in, he turned to Bush and thanked him for the great job he'd done, which I thought was thoroughly disgusting after he talked about how evil Bush was and ran on Bush's crimes, only to flip-flop and wallow in all of them, and it seems to accelerate them.
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:23.025]  So, your final comments on bringing Bush to justice and how that segues into, isn't that another big test of Obama?
[00:40:23.505 --> 00:40:27.768]  Will he do anything to anybody in the Bush Administration, or will he protect them?
[00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:40.438]  Well, you know, the question I have is how much political capital will Obama expend to stop an investigation and a prosecution?
[00:40:40.918 --> 00:40:47.383]  I mean, we're already seeing the beginnings of that with this whole issue around Karl Rove and Harriet Meyers, and we found out that
[00:40:47.915 --> 00:41:10.612]  Fred Fielding, I think it was on January 16th, just before the end of the Bush administration, wrote letters to Karl Rove's attorney and Harriet Meyer's attorney informing them that they had full immunity in perpetuity for any prosecution for actions they had taken.
[00:41:11.113 --> 00:41:12.814]  So it looked as if
[00:41:14.741 --> 00:41:31.592]  Bush and his people are operating on this whole new theory, which has never really been tested in American history, that a president can continue, you know, it's almost like, you know, exerting power from beyond the grave.
[00:41:31.832 --> 00:41:43.560]  I mean, here is someone who has no constitutional authority anymore, basically telling the government that you cannot touch people who served in my administration.
[00:41:44.176 --> 00:41:47.319]  So in your words, is Obama already protecting Bush?
[00:41:48.119 --> 00:41:48.399]  Go ahead.
[00:41:48.479 --> 00:41:49.380]  Excuse me?
[00:41:49.841 --> 00:41:51.702]  Clearly it looks like Obama is going to protect Bush.
[00:41:54.524 --> 00:41:54.985]  I don't know.
[00:41:55.905 --> 00:41:56.266]  I don't know.
[00:41:56.386 --> 00:42:01.510]  All I'm saying is that I don't think Obama will expend a lot of political capital to fight.
[00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:11.177]  You know, say if Congress comes up with a commission, which is what this guy Steve Cohen, who's a congressman from Memphis, Tennessee, is talking about.
[00:42:11.237 --> 00:42:12.138]  You know, they're going to file
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:20.802]  They're going to file a bill, and they're going to try to set up a commission whose purpose is to investigate and perhaps prosecute the crimes of the Bush administration.
[00:42:21.062 --> 00:42:22.302]  We'll see how far that goes.
[00:42:24.502 --> 00:42:25.202]  Absolutely.
[00:42:25.542 --> 00:42:28.383]  I think it's worth looking at Steve Cohen though.
[00:42:28.463 --> 00:42:32.504]  I saw him on TV last week, and I've got to say, the guy's a straight shooter.
[00:42:33.304 --> 00:42:39.825]  And I don't think John Conyers, you know, it's going to come through the Judiciary Committee, and I don't see John Conyers stopping it.
[00:42:40.535 --> 00:42:44.018]  Alright, we're going to get Congressman Cohn on the show then if he'll do it.
[00:42:44.558 --> 00:42:49.302]  Congressman Dan Hamburg, thank you so much for all your time and get better from that cold.
[00:42:49.342 --> 00:42:50.843]  We'll talk to you as soon as this unfolds.
[00:42:51.444 --> 00:42:52.044]  My pleasure.
[00:42:52.665 --> 00:42:53.546]  Thank you so much.
[00:42:54.546 --> 00:42:57.629]  Alright, we'll be right back with your phone calls, a ton of news and a lot more.

[00:43:03.756 --> 00:43:08.338]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with a reflective spray.
[00:43:08.798 --> 00:43:10.659]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[00:43:10.739 --> 00:43:11.899]  We are under the microscope.

[00:44:00.364 --> 00:44:06.770]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:08.812]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:09.944 --> 00:44:10.784]  Who is the enemy?
[00:44:11.305 --> 00:44:11.805]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:12.105 --> 00:44:13.085]  This is his ammo.
[00:44:13.105 --> 00:44:14.446]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:14.486 --> 00:44:16.146]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:16.466 --> 00:44:23.229]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:23.609 --> 00:44:24.049]  Some U.S.
[00:44:24.089 --> 00:44:29.751]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:30.451 --> 00:44:33.974]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:34.334 --> 00:44:36.936]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.

[00:45:47.215 --> 00:45:49.216]  S-U-M-M-I-T.
[00:45:49.436 --> 00:45:51.117]  SouthSummit.com.
[00:45:51.277 --> 00:45:52.458]  Or call toll-free
[00:45:53.218 --> 00:45:55.560]  1-800-234-8654.
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:56.240]  That's 1-800-234-8654.
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:46:08.089]  Alright, let's go right back into this segment quick here, because I want to go to your phone calls here.
[00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:16.075]  For the balance of this hour and the whole next hour, I'm going to take a ton of your calls at 800-259-9231.
[00:46:16.735 --> 00:46:21.699]  And we're also going to cover some news I haven't detailed yet on several very, very serious issues.
[00:46:23.587 --> 00:46:26.490]  All right, first up, I want to tell you about preparedness.
[00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:28.932]  We believe in preparedness here.
[00:46:29.772 --> 00:46:33.536]  And one great place to check out is MySolarBackup.com.
[00:46:33.896 --> 00:46:42.103]  They have a great unit, an emergency power backup kit, which consists of the power source, 1800 power plant, and a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless
[00:46:42.483 --> 00:46:43.003]  Electricity.
[00:46:43.023 --> 00:46:43.304]  That's right.
[00:46:43.344 --> 00:46:44.525]  It generates free electricity.
[00:46:44.925 --> 00:46:50.069]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[00:46:50.469 --> 00:46:54.372]  The solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[00:46:54.412 --> 00:46:55.873]  Take them up in Kentucky and other states.
[00:46:56.293 --> 00:46:57.054]  Totally locked down.
[00:46:57.074 --> 00:46:59.836]  It's sunny days out there, but everything's covered with snow.
[00:46:59.856 --> 00:47:02.138]  If they had a couple of these units, they could run your whole house.
[00:47:02.158 --> 00:47:04.259]  But with one, you could heat at least one room.
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:06.201]  And that could save you.
[00:47:06.241 --> 00:47:09.464]  See, I mean, it's just important to have this type of stuff in these crazy times.
[00:47:09.484 --> 00:47:12.566]  Because once things completely break down, if they do, you won't be able to get these systems.
[00:47:12.886 --> 00:47:13.487]  It'll be very hard.
[00:47:13.507 --> 00:47:14.748]  877-327-0365 is the toll-free number.
[00:47:14.788 --> 00:47:15.248]  MySolarBackup.com.
[00:47:15.268 --> 00:47:15.308]  877-327-0365.
[00:47:15.368 --> 00:47:15.669]  A great unit.
[00:47:23.775 --> 00:47:38.167]  Also on the subject of preparedness, you could hook your little solar power system up to the Ecola Blue, and it runs off solar, or right out of the wall, produces 7.5 gallons a day, about 3.5 gallons even in the driest climates.
[00:47:38.727 --> 00:47:42.570]  It's like 2% humidity here in this office, and it's still producing about a gallon and a half a day.
[00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:43.411]  We've got one here in the office.
[00:47:44.571 --> 00:47:49.256]  I mean, there's almost nothing in here, but it's getting enough for us to all, you know, drink out of it.
[00:47:49.416 --> 00:47:51.439]  The other office would fill up every day, like seven gallons.
[00:47:51.459 --> 00:47:53.181]  This one's so much bigger and drier for some reason.
[00:47:53.201 --> 00:47:53.902]  But side issue!
[00:47:54.923 --> 00:47:55.423]  Here's the number.
[00:47:56.485 --> 00:48:10.678]  Okola Blue, 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043, or the website okolablue.com, big fat banners up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:48:11.379 --> 00:48:14.182]  Then it goes through seven internal filters after it grabs the air
[00:48:15.532 --> 00:48:16.032]  God bless you, Alex.
[00:48:16.072 --> 00:48:16.992]  You're doing the Lord's work.
[00:48:17.012 --> 00:48:18.393]  Hey, I just have two points of interest to make.
[00:48:44.545 --> 00:48:44.845]  I can.
[00:48:45.205 --> 00:48:45.846]  Sure.
[00:48:45.986 --> 00:49:04.876]  First one is, you know, here in California we're suffering a budget crisis, and I just wish that more Californians would wake up and find out about the comprehensive annual finance reports that they have, that they forced them to take their money out of their offshore bank accounts and
[00:49:05.649 --> 00:49:07.972]  Balance the budget and not force us to pay any more taxes.
[00:49:07.992 --> 00:49:08.332]  That's right.
[00:49:08.372 --> 00:49:11.856]  For those that don't know, the Pentagon that took over the U.S.
[00:49:11.936 --> 00:49:25.712]  in 1947, now publicly taking over, the receiver arm of the foreign banks, they took the Chicago mobs model they'd had for decades called Chicago 1313, where they took on average about 65 percent, now it's up to almost 80,
[00:49:27.173 --> 00:49:31.635]  It's like 67% on average nationally, and they take city, county, water district, school district money.
[00:49:32.096 --> 00:49:36.558]  It's put into a double set of books, not for pension investments, but separately.
[00:49:37.098 --> 00:49:41.760]  And then all they were talking about is the budget, instead of talking about the real set of books.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.862]  And every county, city, state, every federal agency has one.
[00:49:45.382 --> 00:49:53.273]  And the bankers use that money to then buy up infrastructure, but now so they don't have to pay the counties and cities the money back, they're bankrupting the shell corporations.
[00:49:53.293 --> 00:50:00.102]  These big banks, these big brokerage firms, they were the fronts telling the cities and counties, invest here, we'll pay off your politicians later.
[00:50:00.342 --> 00:50:01.964]  It's totally criminal, but it's totally legal.
[00:50:02.925 --> 00:50:05.026]  And no one will talk about it, but I made a film about it.
[00:50:06.707 --> 00:50:07.968]  But all the documents are public.
[00:50:07.988 --> 00:50:11.689]  Just Google Comprehensive Annual Financial Report and you can read it.
[00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:15.931]  And then they have to blow out all the big corporations.
[00:50:15.951 --> 00:50:17.052]  People see those falling.
[00:50:17.072 --> 00:50:18.312]  They think the elites are really in trouble.
[00:50:18.593 --> 00:50:22.615]  Just like Enron, they've already moved all the real assets and cash out the back door.
[00:50:23.715 --> 00:50:24.335]  It's the globalists.
[00:50:24.355 --> 00:50:28.637]  They're money laundering, drug dealing bankers who literally own the printing presses that issue the money.
[00:50:29.098 --> 00:50:30.578]  And you write your IRS check to them.
[00:50:30.658 --> 00:50:31.639]  It's to the Federal Reserve.
[00:50:32.339 --> 00:50:32.920]  Was that your point?
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:33.481]  You have one more.
[00:50:33.501 --> 00:50:34.362]  I got one more.
[00:50:34.803 --> 00:50:35.183]  One more.
[00:50:35.203 --> 00:50:36.164]  Straight ahead when we come back.
[00:50:36.184 --> 00:50:36.905]  Fourth hour.
[00:50:42.172 --> 00:50:44.255]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:44.796 --> 00:50:47.940]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:50.404 --> 00:50:51.965]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:52.085 --> 00:50:56.747]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:50:56.827 --> 00:50:59.589]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:50:59.789 --> 00:51:02.651]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:02.831 --> 00:51:08.674]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:51:08.914 --> 00:51:11.817]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:12.158 --> 00:51:19.045]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:51:19.145 --> 00:51:22.268]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:51:22.428 --> 00:51:22.689]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:25.091 --> 00:51:27.353]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:51:27.553 --> 00:51:33.639]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:51:33.819 --> 00:51:37.142]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:37.182 --> 00:51:38.324]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:51:38.344 --> 00:51:38.984]  Take action today.
[00:51:39.004 --> 00:51:40.225]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.101]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:55.581 --> 00:51:58.342]  Alex Jones, on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:51:58.362 --> 00:52:10.207]  See, how this works is, the global engineers, they're in control because they're smart,
[00:52:22.349 --> 00:52:23.810]  They're just totally ruthless and criminal.
[00:52:24.091 --> 00:52:25.172]  We're a bunch of naive sheep.
[00:52:25.932 --> 00:52:33.379]  What they do is, they have unfunded mandates, federal laws on the states and the counties and the cities, with regulations and control.
[00:52:33.779 --> 00:52:35.721]  That ups the huge budgets of the states.
[00:52:36.161 --> 00:52:44.069]  Then they get the states, the counties, the cities, every other governmental and quasi-governmental district to invest in offshore investments.
[00:52:44.289 --> 00:52:47.271]  And the lie was, then they'll just take the profit from those and put them in budget.
[00:52:47.532 --> 00:52:48.112]  But they never do.
[00:52:49.253 --> 00:52:57.448]  Then the cities in the last few years, they started in Orange County, and then with the state investment fund about five years ago, they said, we want your money, and they said, you can't have it.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:01.581]  And that's really one of the things that started things imploding, but that was by design.
[00:53:02.121 --> 00:53:04.341]  And now they're going to get the money out, and it's gone.
[00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:09.562]  Now that they're way over budget, they want some of the comprehensive annual financial report, mafia, you know, books.
[00:53:09.903 --> 00:53:11.303]  And they're saying, it isn't there for you.
[00:53:11.783 --> 00:53:12.323]  You don't get it.
[00:53:13.283 --> 00:53:14.704]  Because the market's gone down.
[00:53:14.744 --> 00:53:16.024]  These companies are insolvent.
[00:53:16.384 --> 00:53:19.785]  The banks and brokerage firms and investment houses won't say how much money they've got.
[00:53:19.865 --> 00:53:21.045]  Government won't make them show it.
[00:53:21.405 --> 00:53:25.586]  They're the ones talking about more regulation to fix it, but they're the banks that are above regulation.
[00:53:26.443 --> 00:53:28.913]  They don't follow the same rules.
[00:53:28.933 --> 00:53:29.958]  They don't pay taxes.
[00:53:29.978 --> 00:53:30.881]  They do whatever they want.
[00:53:31.803 --> 00:53:35.704]  You can read news articles every day about top companies paying no taxes or 1% taxes.
[00:53:36.044 --> 00:53:36.964]  And no one enforces.
[00:53:37.024 --> 00:53:39.805]  Madoff, for decades they knew it was a Ponzi scheme.
[00:53:40.065 --> 00:53:41.705]  But he started the stock exchange.
[00:53:42.025 --> 00:53:42.545]  NASDAQ.
[00:53:43.125 --> 00:53:45.886]  So these guys don't play by the rules, folks.
[00:53:46.666 --> 00:53:47.886]  No one's looking at them.
[00:53:48.046 --> 00:53:49.207]  This is their big heist.
[00:53:49.527 --> 00:53:56.588]  And the police state you see is to stop you from rightfully going and taking your government over through elections or physically and bringing them to justice.
[00:53:56.628 --> 00:53:58.429]  The only thing that can stop them is the people.
[00:53:58.689 --> 00:54:00.309]  And NORTHCOM is here to stop the people.
[00:54:00.709 --> 00:54:03.474]  NORTHCOM'S HERE TO DESTROY AMERICA AND BRING DOWN THE REPUBLIC!
[00:54:04.336 --> 00:54:11.729]  AND I CAN BRING RON PAUL ON, I CAN BRING CONGRESSMAN HAMBURG ON, I CAN BRING SENATOR INHOFE ON HERE, I CAN BRING THEM ALL ON TO TELL YOU, WE'RE UNDER NORTHCOM MARTIAL LAW!
[00:54:13.015 --> 00:54:14.976]  Yeah, it was a point of interest I wanted to make.
[00:54:14.996 --> 00:54:19.399]  I don't know if you know this, but here in Southern California, we have the Magna Carta on display at the Ronald Reagan Library.
[00:54:44.065 --> 00:54:47.566]  And it kind of alarmed me when I found that out last month.
[00:54:48.766 --> 00:54:55.288]  You know, if the New World Order wanted to stage an attack, you know, for pretext for many other actions.
[00:54:55.308 --> 00:54:59.909]  I believe there's three copies of the Magna Carta, like there were ten copies of the Declaration of Independence.
[00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:13.372]  Right, but for symbolism, you know, state, if they wanted to stage an attack, you know, they could get rid of the document, destroy it, and, you know, have some kind of
[00:55:14.301 --> 00:55:20.722]  Yeah, for those that don't know, the Magna Carta is what the Bill of Rights and Constitution comes out of, from 1215 and running mate.
[00:55:21.643 --> 00:55:27.024]  And the first thing Blair did when he got in office in 97-96 was to say, I am getting rid of the Magna Carta.
[00:55:27.784 --> 00:55:37.146]  And the public was so dumbed down, you know, liquored up in England, I mean they admit, most alcoholic state in the world, just as decadent as the Americans, they're like, screw it, get rid of it!
[00:55:37.606 --> 00:55:41.007]  Now the police are on the street going, terrorism if you photograph us.
[00:55:41.247 --> 00:55:43.107]  You're not allowed to videotape us beating somebody.
[00:55:43.127 --> 00:55:44.108]  We're in charge as a terrorist.
[00:55:44.468 --> 00:55:45.948]  Now they're busy stealing people's property.
[00:55:46.128 --> 00:55:49.649]  They have cameras in all the school's bathrooms as the children use the bathroom.
[00:55:49.889 --> 00:55:51.849]  That was in the news today and the school said, what's the big deal?
[00:55:52.429 --> 00:55:54.790]  So we videotape our children and now schools are in the U.S.
[00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:56.550]  putting cameras in bathrooms everywhere.
[00:55:56.770 --> 00:55:56.990]  That's 1984!
[00:55:58.571 --> 00:56:00.331]  Very interesting point about the Magna Carta.
[00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:02.052]  Very, very interesting.
[00:56:02.412 --> 00:56:03.252]  Oh, something else, go ahead.
[00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:07.651]  I just want to say I'm here in my prayers and keep fighting New World Order.
[00:56:08.292 --> 00:56:08.972]  I appreciate it.
[00:56:09.593 --> 00:56:13.476]  Yeah, it's only your prayers that keep us going here.
[00:56:15.337 --> 00:56:19.580]  That's why I dedicate so much time to this, not because I'm even some wonderful good guy.
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:23.243]  I mean, I am a good guy overall, but I'm worldly as well.
[00:56:24.003 --> 00:56:27.426]  I am here doing this because I know that
[00:56:29.468 --> 00:56:34.329]  No matter what the risk to myself, the cost of doing nothing is too high to my family and my fellow humanity.
[00:56:34.949 --> 00:56:39.750]  Because I know what happens to others will happen to myself or my children, or their great-grandchildren.
[00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:41.890]  And I just love humanity.
[00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:46.111]  I just like good guys, creative people, I love honorable people.
[00:56:46.511 --> 00:56:49.331]  I hate scum, I hate traitors, I hate bullies.
[00:56:49.471 --> 00:56:58.073]  And let me tell you, filthy, disgusting, criminal bullies are in control of our society and they've got a giant spin machine trying to cover for them, but it's not going to work if you stop them.
[00:57:00.782 --> 00:57:10.872]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:57:11.353 --> 00:57:12.314]  Garden in a can!
[00:57:14.209 --> 00:57:14.489]  I think so.
[00:57:36.377 --> 00:57:40.338]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.

[00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:06.195]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:58:06.575 --> 00:58:08.537]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:58:09.218 --> 00:58:10.238]  But who is the enemy?
[00:58:10.759 --> 00:58:11.279]  Bin Laden.
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:12.560]  This is his ammo.
[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:13.921]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:58:13.941 --> 00:58:15.623]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:58:15.923 --> 00:58:22.688]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:58:23.069 --> 00:58:23.509]  Some U.S.
[00:58:23.549 --> 00:58:29.194]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:58:29.894 --> 00:58:33.377]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:58:33.397 --> 00:58:36.199]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:58:59.844 --> 00:59:03.107]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:59:03.287 --> 00:59:07.370]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:59:07.530 --> 00:59:18.980]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:25.025]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:59:25.145 --> 00:59:25.505]  We're good to go.
[00:59:48.717 --> 00:59:53.559]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:53.579 --> 00:59:55.139]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:59:55.159 --> 00:59:56.440]  Okay, going back to your calls.
[01:00:30.013 --> 01:00:36.956]  Hello Alex, I've got three short questions for you.
[01:00:38.517 --> 01:00:40.678]  The first question has to do with the economy.
[01:00:40.698 --> 01:00:48.722]  Real quickly, I'm a would-be federal government employee, a public planner.
[01:00:50.072 --> 01:00:54.293]  And I'm pretty seriously concerned with how community governments are being directed.
[01:00:56.034 --> 01:01:09.677]  For instance, it's hard for me to believe that particularly people in government are so stupid that they can't predict the fall of the value of the dollar in the face of a lot of common sense analysis and prediction.
[01:01:09.997 --> 01:01:11.898]  Sir, sir, sir, hold on.
[01:01:11.978 --> 01:01:14.338]  They set the policies that did it.
[01:01:15.118 --> 01:01:16.919]  So of course they know it was going to happen, yes.
[01:01:17.622 --> 01:01:21.865]  That's what I'm seeing.
[01:01:22.465 --> 01:01:24.507]  And yet I'm seeing a lot of people who deny that.
[01:01:25.107 --> 01:01:26.408]  Well, I mean, none of that's your opinion.
[01:01:26.928 --> 01:01:28.709]  They've written hundreds of white papers.
[01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:30.991]  The Federal Reserve's admitted they were doing this.
[01:01:31.291 --> 01:01:45.981]  So, if there's an intentional aspect to this, and you and I probably agree that there is, why would the various banks that own the Federal Reserve deflate the value of the dollar?
[01:01:47.074 --> 01:01:47.995]  That's my first question.
[01:01:48.015 --> 01:01:49.055]  Fair enough.
[01:01:49.095 --> 01:01:52.317]  As an analogue to Irving Fisher's Scam Scrap,
[01:02:11.764 --> 01:02:17.546]  Would be, I think, an antidote to any fractional reserve banking system's constriction of credit.
[01:02:18.266 --> 01:02:22.487]  So the second question has to do with how such a system would be implemented.
[01:02:22.547 --> 01:02:26.268]  How you think such a system would be implemented.
[01:02:26.289 --> 01:02:34.691]  And the third question has to do with the people who are responsible for what we're in.
[01:02:36.752 --> 01:02:40.653]  When considering the history of Bolshevism and the Communist Manifesto,
[01:02:41.636 --> 01:02:56.282]  When considering the protocols of the Elders of Zion, when considering Harold Rosenthal's interview and many other documents, what do you think the relationship between Zionism and the New World Order is?
[01:02:57.523 --> 01:03:01.464]  Do you think Zionism is a genuine racist movement?
[01:03:03.085 --> 01:03:04.986]  And really that's about all I have.
[01:03:05.066 --> 01:03:07.007]  Okay, that's three huge questions.
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:20.209]  Why would the private Federal Reserve that controls the United States and gets to milk it and where American taxpayers pay their money, the private Federal Reserve, why would they kill the goose that laid the golden eggs?
[01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:22.591]  Because they're internationalists.
[01:03:22.631 --> 01:03:26.694]  Because the Federal Reserve has stock held in it by international groups and private families.
[01:03:26.714 --> 01:03:27.315]  That's on record.
[01:03:28.211 --> 01:03:33.433]  And so they must sacrifice the United States on the altar of globalism to bring in the new system.
[01:03:33.753 --> 01:03:38.594]  What did the Wall Street Journal last week with that headline about the new world orders here, North American Union?
[01:03:38.954 --> 01:03:41.595]  They said, oh, this is the answer to fix the crisis.
[01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:43.616]  You're not going to have a good economy.
[01:03:43.656 --> 01:03:52.939]  You're not going to have a job and food on the table and clothes for your children and a car to drive to work and no vacations, no life, basically, depression, unless you do what we say.
[01:03:53.539 --> 01:04:07.210]  And that is, all these different private central banks, owned by the same families, are now merging into one global bank that will set taxes, regulations, carbon taxes, micromanaging every part of your life.
[01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:08.671]  So, they've answered it for you.
[01:04:09.191 --> 01:04:16.317]  They said decades ago, in the Trilateral Commission documents in the 70s that we've covered at nauseam, that they would implode the economy around 2005, they're a few years behind,
[01:04:17.461 --> 01:04:21.443]  And merge the American Union, the Asian Union, the European Union together.
[01:04:21.503 --> 01:04:23.004]  Those agreements have already all been signed.
[01:04:23.444 --> 01:04:28.026]  We're already in an American Union, already merging with the European Union as of two years ago.
[01:04:28.386 --> 01:04:34.209]  I have Bush on the White House lawn saying it with the leader of the European Union and Merkel, the head of Germany.
[01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:37.470]  And we have the Judicial Watch documents through Foyer.
[01:04:37.550 --> 01:04:38.090]  We're in it.
[01:04:38.631 --> 01:04:45.374]  And the public's just now being told by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times that, oh yeah, it is a North American Union, that'll fix the crisis.
[01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:50.972]  So see, they always get us four or five steps ahead and then tell us about a step five, six steps behind.
[01:04:52.113 --> 01:04:52.833]  That's how they do this.
[01:04:52.853 --> 01:04:55.375]  You know, they build the camps, then they introduce legislation.
[01:04:55.635 --> 01:04:59.277]  Oh, we're going to legalize camps and have the local police under it and the local clergy.
[01:04:59.297 --> 01:05:03.059]  I said I was going to blitz through phone calls.
[01:05:03.079 --> 01:05:06.361]  These questions are so important, it's hard to not answer them all.
[01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:17.052]  Then you talked about what type of money system should we have if we remove the fractional reserve banking fraud of the international bankers, which they're not even doing fractional reserve banking now.
[01:05:17.093 --> 01:05:17.933]  They just do whatever they want.
[01:05:18.333 --> 01:05:19.633]  And that answers your first question.
[01:05:19.893 --> 01:05:25.915]  They've created unlimited capital, thousands of trillions over the last few decades in European and U.S.
[01:05:25.955 --> 01:05:26.155]  money.
[01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:30.096]  They have bought up real assets with it, knowing it would later devalue the money.
[01:05:30.376 --> 01:05:33.177]  They've held that off, and now that phase is coming.
[01:05:34.217 --> 01:05:36.339]  So, that's what's happening there.
[01:05:36.379 --> 01:05:37.700]  What type of system should we have?
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:46.326]  If we had a good government, if the people were involved and educated about fractional reserve banking and educated about paper script, it really does grease the skids of the economy.
[01:05:46.767 --> 01:05:49.248]  It's just going to be used and abused and will always be abused.
[01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:51.130]  And so it's a very dangerous system.
[01:05:51.790 --> 01:06:01.337]  Set currencies of silver or gold or tally sticks or seashells or wampum, glass beads, whatever people have used throughout history, salt, sugar, spices,
[01:06:03.541 --> 01:06:04.662]  Frankincense and myrrh.
[01:06:05.422 --> 01:06:08.064]  That can all be misused and cornered.
[01:06:08.244 --> 01:06:14.549]  People always go in in history when that happens and buy up the key distribution of that, the key production of those things and then they manipulate that.
[01:06:16.410 --> 01:06:18.091]  So that's a problem as well.
[01:06:19.272 --> 01:06:21.614]  But it's better than a fiat system run by the elite.
[01:06:21.974 --> 01:06:24.676]  Could we have a fiat system run by the government?
[01:06:24.876 --> 01:06:31.861]  I tend to lean towards that and disagree with Ron Paul and the Austrian School of Economics about their Goldback system because we're so deep into this
[01:06:32.341 --> 01:06:33.702]  That we'd have to extricate ourselves.
[01:06:33.742 --> 01:06:35.223]  And Ron Paul has said it would take some time.
[01:06:35.563 --> 01:06:37.285]  So I think a hybrid of the two systems.
[01:06:37.585 --> 01:06:39.747]  I think competing monetary systems are the answer.
[01:06:40.067 --> 01:06:43.629]  So perhaps we can have a script system, a private script system, or group of script systems.
[01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:46.071]  And then a government system.
[01:06:46.432 --> 01:06:54.177]  And then at the same time have a barter system with gold and silver that would be done also off of script.
[01:06:54.217 --> 01:06:58.240]  Then you're back to the gold smiths who would only have so much gold in their vault and issuing too much script.
[01:06:59.261 --> 01:07:03.665]  Buying off politicians with their undue capital that's really fiat.
[01:07:04.947 --> 01:07:08.930]  And on the subject of Zionism, you know, we have guests on here to talk about.
[01:07:09.949 --> 01:07:23.817]  What Zionism is, and Zionism isn't a criticism of Jews themselves, Zionism is a political ideology very similar to what Hitler said, or the white supremacists say, or what the black Israelite movement says.
[01:07:24.098 --> 01:07:28.460]  I mean, every group, Japan has a group that says they're the master race and everybody else is scum.
[01:07:29.401 --> 01:07:34.164]  And it says that everybody else are basically animals who can be killed and destroyed at will.
[01:07:38.208 --> 01:07:45.111]  It's a horrible political system, certainly for the Palestinians in and around Israel, and so I am in opposition to that apartheid type system.
[01:07:45.131 --> 01:07:55.034]  I think it's very hypocritical that Israel can do things that's way worse than what South Africa did, and it's A-OK with the media, but then what South Africa did was bad.
[01:07:55.314 --> 01:07:56.695]  No, it's both equally bad.
[01:07:57.315 --> 01:07:58.015]  And this is the thing.
[01:07:58.355 --> 01:07:59.736]  Humans do this to humans.
[01:08:00.393 --> 01:08:04.796]  You know, Europeans, before they took over Africa, they had slave Europeans.
[01:08:05.436 --> 01:08:08.278]  And then as soon as they revolted, they said, well, we'll just grab these people as slaves.
[01:08:08.518 --> 01:08:09.999]  And they had black folks there selling them.
[01:08:10.339 --> 01:08:13.521]  You know, because blacks had black... Humans enslave each other.
[01:08:14.381 --> 01:08:19.945]  And we have to come to the realization of that system throughout history and expose it.
[01:08:19.965 --> 01:08:20.865]  I mean, what's the drug war?
[01:08:21.185 --> 01:08:23.467]  Millions and millions of non-violent marijuana smokers?
[01:08:24.547 --> 01:08:26.489]  Staying in prison longer than violent offenders?
[01:08:26.549 --> 01:08:26.709]  Why?
[01:08:26.729 --> 01:08:28.270]  Because a marijuana smoker is a good worker.
[01:08:29.331 --> 01:08:30.012]  They're not on pot.
[01:08:30.032 --> 01:08:30.812]  They're not stoned.
[01:08:31.773 --> 01:08:36.877]  They're not crunking, as Paul Hartman would say.
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:42.262]  And so, it's slavery.
[01:08:42.322 --> 01:08:43.543]  It's slavery legalized.
[01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:57.973]  But I also don't like to bash Israel too much because I don't want to be in association with all the other tribal groups that make up exaggerated stuff about Israel, go crazy about Israel, hate all Jews, you know, make it a big thing.
[01:08:58.533 --> 01:09:02.115]  I don't like all this tribalism, all this racism, whatever you want to call it.
[01:09:02.155 --> 01:09:03.675]  Now I just spent ten minutes with one caller.
[01:09:04.315 --> 01:09:06.096]  I've got to somehow get to more callers here.
[01:09:06.756 --> 01:09:09.557]  But Michael in North Carolina, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:09:11.518 --> 01:09:13.118]  I really enjoyed your speech.
[01:09:16.641 --> 01:09:19.062]  What speech was that?
[01:09:19.162 --> 01:09:20.723]  The speech that you were just talking about.
[01:09:22.104 --> 01:09:23.004]  Your three questions.
[01:09:25.705 --> 01:09:29.127]  I can't say I disagreed with anything that you said in particular.
[01:09:29.807 --> 01:09:35.070]  I would like you to talk a little bit more about Irving Fisher's stamp script, but that's about it.
[01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:37.331]  You know, I have read about that.
[01:09:37.431 --> 01:09:41.472]  I'm familiar with it, but I'm not that big an expert on it.
[01:09:41.492 --> 01:09:42.513]  Why don't you explain it to folks?
[01:09:44.187 --> 01:09:50.489]  Okay, Irving Fisher's stamp script had to do with getting to the fundament of what is money.
[01:09:51.989 --> 01:09:54.390]  And what is money has to do with labor.
[01:09:55.831 --> 01:09:58.291]  It doesn't have to do with the value of gold.
[01:09:58.792 --> 01:10:01.732]  It doesn't have to do with the value of silver or any other precious metal.
[01:10:01.752 --> 01:10:03.233]  It doesn't have to do with the value of land.
[01:10:05.113 --> 01:10:06.474]  It has to do with the value of labor.
[01:10:08.635 --> 01:10:13.276]  And how you put value on that and how you trade value for that.
[01:10:16.346 --> 01:10:27.897]  Yes, and then getting local scripts which everybody agrees upon and then there's a known amount that's out there and it's just an agreed upon mode of exchange for your labor, for your time, for your energy.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:38.125]  That's why I'm saying we need local currencies competing with regional currencies, competing with national currencies, competing with international currencies.
[01:10:38.445 --> 01:10:40.447]  That way elites can't corner the market.
[01:10:40.787 --> 01:10:44.770]  It's a separation of powers within the entire monetary scheme.
[01:10:45.210 --> 01:10:48.353]  It is a liberalization of the symbols of credit.
[01:10:49.352 --> 01:10:50.874]  And that's what we need.
[01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:53.697]  We need liberation in the money system.
[01:10:53.717 --> 01:10:57.080]  But the average public, that's why we're enslaved, is like, well, what's real money?
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:57.821]  I want money.
[01:10:58.021 --> 01:11:01.665]  You can show somebody a big wad of $100 bills, and they'll just get all excited.
[01:11:03.006 --> 01:11:04.888]  And all this is, is something that was just printed up.
[01:11:05.609 --> 01:11:10.311]  The Federal Reserve orders it printed by the Governmental Treasury, and then it's issued.
[01:11:10.331 --> 01:11:13.973]  But that's less than 1% now of physical real money in circulation.
[01:11:14.233 --> 01:11:15.954]  It's all just zeros and ones in a computer.
[01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:21.697]  The bank just says you've got $10,000 or $5,000 or a million, whatever it is, in the bank.
[01:11:21.917 --> 01:11:22.937]  It's just zeros and ones.
[01:11:22.997 --> 01:11:33.643]  But by you going and depositing your little paper check in there, they loan out 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 times all the real physical money they've got in there, leveraged.
[01:11:34.463 --> 01:11:35.744]  And so what does the bank really want?
[01:11:35.764 --> 01:11:39.585]  It wants you to go bankrupt because it doesn't care about the fake zeros and ones in its computer.
[01:11:39.885 --> 01:11:40.625]  It wants your house.
[01:11:40.706 --> 01:11:41.466]  It wants your company.
[01:11:41.786 --> 01:11:45.587]  It wants to set up a depression so everybody collapses.
[01:11:46.388 --> 01:11:55.331]  That's why they issue all this credit because they control it so that their false credit bubble of debt can implode and take over the entire economy with it.
[01:11:55.872 --> 01:11:59.393]  Alright, more calls straight ahead right here on the one and only GCN Radio Network.
[01:12:00.618 --> 01:12:02.120]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.762]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:12:04.042 --> 01:12:06.284]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:12:06.725 --> 01:12:11.490]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:12:11.871 --> 01:12:14.714]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:12:15.074 --> 01:12:18.558]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.

[01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:01.350]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:06.212]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:13:06.372 --> 01:13:14.175]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:13:14.435 --> 01:13:19.797]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:13:20.017 --> 01:13:26.979]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:13:27.279 --> 01:13:32.602]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:13:32.882 --> 01:13:37.625]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:13:37.965 --> 01:13:45.569]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:13:45.909 --> 01:13:52.133]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:13:52.473 --> 01:13:53.574]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:13:56.831 --> 01:13:59.232]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:13:59.992 --> 01:14:05.474]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:14:05.694 --> 01:14:06.994]  And we knew what to do.
[01:14:07.014 --> 01:14:08.795]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:14:09.035 --> 01:14:15.436]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:14:16.057 --> 01:14:24.579]  Whitman, EPA Director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:14:24.963 --> 01:14:31.765]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:14:32.065 --> 01:14:35.105]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:14:35.225 --> 01:14:40.427]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:14:40.987 --> 01:14:43.627]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[01:14:55.564 --> 01:15:04.086]  Rough roads might be ahead for the economy, but your vehicle doesn't have to experience them.
[01:15:04.346 --> 01:15:06.947]  Can't afford a new vehicle or even an expensive repair?

[01:16:11.578 --> 01:16:13.319]  All right, let's try to get through some of these calls.
[01:16:14.359 --> 01:16:15.499]  Who's up next here, John?
[01:16:18.461 --> 01:16:20.201]  Joe in Chicago.
[01:16:20.261 --> 01:16:21.141]  You're on the air, Joe.
[01:16:21.182 --> 01:16:21.522]  Welcome.
[01:16:22.362 --> 01:16:23.923]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:16:23.963 --> 01:16:24.363]  Good, sir.
[01:16:25.403 --> 01:16:26.223]  Well, you know what?
[01:16:26.583 --> 01:16:34.306]  It's kind of funny, the rise of phone calls that you're getting from Illinois and the Chicago area ever since Groblegovich, this whole scandal came to pass.
[01:16:34.326 --> 01:16:38.668]  Well, we've always gotten a lot of calls from Illinois, but, you know, we've been getting even more, I've noticed.
[01:16:39.437 --> 01:16:42.258]  Yeah, and I do have to say one thing about this guy.
[01:16:42.298 --> 01:17:01.683]  I mean, there was a commentator, a political commentator on WGN News that basically said this whole thing, he's like, it's basically the whole impeachment panel was like, and I quote, he's like, it was like a bunch of flies hanging on a wall, all blaming one fly for having dirty feet.
[01:17:03.061 --> 01:17:03.321]  Okay.
[01:17:03.341 --> 01:17:07.503]  Yeah, but you can't accept the fact that they've all got dirty feet that you don't kick them out.
[01:17:08.044 --> 01:17:08.704]  That is true.
[01:17:09.064 --> 01:17:09.585]  That is true.
[01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:15.468]  But one thing that I saw that was really interesting, the day
[01:17:16.249 --> 01:17:16.549]  I don't know.
[01:17:36.718 --> 01:17:42.500]  His rights were violated as far as him not being able to bring forth any witness.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:49.543]  That's right, and the Senate lied and said we used the Bill Clinton rules, and Bill Clinton wasn't allowed to bring witnesses.
[01:17:49.623 --> 01:17:52.345]  Funny, I remember Bill Clinton brought a bunch of them, including Vernon Jordan.
[01:17:52.885 --> 01:17:58.567]  So they are lying about the fact that, oh well, it's normal to not allow people to call witnesses.
[01:17:59.968 --> 01:18:04.750]  And so definitely it's a corrupt system sacrificing him for some reason.
[01:18:05.610 --> 01:18:15.039]  And I don't know if that's the Bush administration blackmailing Obama, because Blagojevich came up with him under the control of... Blagojevich was a congressman, formerly, too.
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:19.523]  So he's always worked with Rahm Emanuel, who's as dirty as they come.
[01:18:19.563 --> 01:18:25.909]  So, I mean, we don't know the full extent of this, but in the final equation, it's a diversion and a distraction to begin with.
[01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:26.830]  I mean, sure.
[01:18:27.802 --> 01:18:36.767]  Elliot Spitzer starts going after Bank of America and others for scams they're running, and suddenly, you know, his one impropriety with hookers, he was under FBI surveillance the whole time.
[01:18:36.787 --> 01:18:37.847]  They're all under surveillance.
[01:18:37.867 --> 01:18:39.748]  The British Parliament's under surveillance.
[01:18:39.768 --> 01:18:43.310]  They're arresting members of Parliament now when they leak information about government corruption.
[01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:47.973]  Because the intelligence agencies that work for the big banks, they are the real government.
[01:18:48.633 --> 01:19:03.523]  And so, this slapping governors around and congressmen around and they're going after Rangel right now and everybody else, that's about the real government, the military-industrial complex, letting everybody know in line, we don't care how powerful you are, we'll crush you whenever we want.
[01:19:03.623 --> 01:19:06.685]  Even if you've got dirt on us, our media won't let that come out.
[01:19:06.926 --> 01:19:08.767]  And you don't get a fair trial, do you understand?
[01:19:08.787 --> 01:19:11.188]  Right, right, exactly.
[01:19:11.329 --> 01:19:12.329]  No, I mean, it's bad.
[01:19:12.970 --> 01:19:14.711]  And the thing that's really interesting about it is,
[01:19:15.427 --> 01:19:39.089]  Which kind of hit home, I mean, even though, you know, he is a pseudo-scumbag, you know, to begin with, but the thing that was really interesting that he said in his speech, which, you know, he was getting kind of teary-eyed and stuff like that, but the one thing that he did say is he talked about, you know, his First Amendment rights, he talked about all of his rights to be able to speak about this, and he says if you think that they would do this to a governor,
[01:19:39.838 --> 01:19:43.460]  What do you think that they would do to you, the ordinary citizen?
[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:45.701]  I'm also fighting for your rights.
[01:19:45.881 --> 01:19:47.121]  I hear you, I appreciate your call.
[01:19:48.982 --> 01:19:50.183]  Yeah, it's bad.
[01:19:50.203 --> 01:20:00.968]  The reason I don't care if they destroy him, even if they're violating his rights, I am against that, and I certainly want him to be able to call witnesses, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to cry tears for Blagojevich.
[01:20:01.988 --> 01:20:08.051]  The guy, three months ago, said he's calling out the National Guard for door-to-door gun confiscation in Illinois.
[01:20:10.618 --> 01:20:12.279]  I mean, he's evil, folks.
[01:20:12.479 --> 01:20:12.940]  He's evil.
[01:20:15.742 --> 01:20:17.123]  Tommy in Michigan, you're on the air.
[01:20:17.163 --> 01:20:17.843]  Go ahead, Tommy.
[01:20:18.524 --> 01:20:18.804]  Alex.
[01:20:19.604 --> 01:20:19.945]  Hello.
[01:20:20.625 --> 01:20:20.885]  Alex.
[01:20:21.926 --> 01:20:22.066]  Hey.
[01:20:22.867 --> 01:20:23.047]  Hey.
[01:20:23.167 --> 01:20:23.467]  Okay.
[01:20:24.067 --> 01:20:25.668]  Hey, I got a couple questions for you here.
[01:20:27.190 --> 01:20:27.670]  Can you hear me?
[01:20:28.510 --> 01:20:29.291]  Loud and clear, brother.
[01:20:29.311 --> 01:20:30.372]  Alright.
[01:20:31.232 --> 01:20:36.416]  Alright, so I don't really see people standing up against this whole New World Order thing because
[01:20:37.093 --> 01:20:43.177]  From what I've come across on the internet these days, it's like people are just, they're just arguing with each other.
[01:20:43.197 --> 01:20:44.979]  Yeah, they're trying to be slaves, yeah.
[01:20:46.159 --> 01:20:52.604]  Yeah, and they claim they're, you know, anti-New World Order, I'm going to change this, and
[01:20:53.413 --> 01:20:59.397]  You know, they've come out of, they've run out of things to really talk about, and... They mainly talk about me.
[01:20:59.417 --> 01:21:00.118]  Right, exactly.
[01:21:00.938 --> 01:21:02.839]  They talk about me more than they talk about Obama.
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.101]  I mean, literally, I'm like... Exactly.
[01:21:05.141 --> 01:21:06.382]  Which actually only helps me.
[01:21:06.462 --> 01:21:09.404]  I love the fact they spend their energy attacking me everywhere.
[01:21:10.284 --> 01:21:12.526]  People just remember my name and go check it out.
[01:21:12.886 --> 01:21:15.428]  That's the big dirty secret, is that I actually love it.
[01:21:15.448 --> 01:21:16.969]  I mean, it's all a bunch of baloney anyways.
[01:21:16.989 --> 01:21:17.629]  It's not true.
[01:21:17.970 --> 01:21:18.690]  None of it sticks.
[01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:19.691]  I'm gonna let them make up
[01:21:20.745 --> 01:21:25.327]  Whatever malarkey they want, but let me comment on that when we come back.
[01:21:25.627 --> 01:21:26.628]  Anything else you want to answer?
[01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:28.409]  Yeah, I'll stick around.
[01:21:29.349 --> 01:21:30.310]  Well, just go ahead and add it now.
[01:21:30.330 --> 01:21:30.630]  Go ahead.
[01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:31.530]  Okay.
[01:21:31.711 --> 01:21:33.872]  Well, yes.
[01:21:34.492 --> 01:21:35.352]  I guess that's it, Alex.
[01:21:35.613 --> 01:21:36.073]  I appreciate it.
[01:21:36.093 --> 01:21:36.273]  All right.
[01:21:36.593 --> 01:21:37.353]  Good to hear from you.
[01:21:37.433 --> 01:21:42.236]  I'm going to comment on what you had to say when we come back, okay?
[01:21:43.236 --> 01:21:46.378]  This is key information straight ahead after this quick break.
[01:21:46.678 --> 01:21:48.039]  We'll be back in three.
[01:21:50.623 --> 01:21:53.608]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.549 --> 01:21:57.234]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:00.925 --> 01:22:04.306]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:22:04.446 --> 01:22:09.667]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:22:09.847 --> 01:22:14.628]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:22:15.008 --> 01:22:26.111]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:22:26.531 --> 01:22:32.077]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:22:32.297 --> 01:22:38.383]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:22:38.563 --> 01:22:39.223]  What about you?
[01:22:39.604 --> 01:22:45.650]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for our special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:23:00.424 --> 01:23:03.547]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[01:23:03.647 --> 01:23:06.750]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:08.772]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:23:09.747 --> 01:23:10.768]  But who is the enemy?
[01:23:11.288 --> 01:23:11.808]  Bin Laden.
[01:23:12.089 --> 01:23:13.089]  This is his M.O.
[01:23:13.109 --> 01:23:14.430]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:16.111]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:23:16.451 --> 01:23:23.216]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:23:23.596 --> 01:23:24.036]  Some U.S.
[01:23:24.076 --> 01:23:29.760]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:33.942]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:23:34.302 --> 01:23:36.924]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:24:00.137 --> 01:24:05.842]  People around the world are testifying that their cataracts are quickly disappearing like magic thanks to Can-C.
[01:24:05.982 --> 01:24:15.830]  The original Can-C eyedrop used in clinical trials maintains that only the original unadulterated formula is effective in reducing, reversing and slowing the occurrence of senile cataract.
[01:24:15.970 --> 01:24:20.332]  CanSee can also assist in lowering the intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma.
[01:24:20.452 --> 01:24:27.414]  CanSee is beneficial for contact lens disorders, to treat corneal disorders, combat eye strain, kidney's computer vision syndrome, and more.
[01:24:27.534 --> 01:24:33.336]  People enjoying the benefits while using CanSee report no side effects and the drops are gentle and don't cause eye burning.
[01:24:33.416 --> 01:24:34.117]  We're good to go!
[01:25:12.538 --> 01:25:14.900]  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[01:25:15.821 --> 01:25:20.646]  We've got a long way to go, and a short time to get there.
[01:25:20.686 --> 01:25:22.808]  I'm eastbound, just one more bandit run.
[01:25:23.108 --> 01:25:25.570]  Oh, Smokey, keep your foot part on the pedal.
[01:25:26.111 --> 01:25:27.492]  Son, never mind them brakes.
[01:25:27.912 --> 01:25:31.496]  Let it all hang out, cause we gotta run today.
[01:25:31.596 --> 01:25:35.039]  The boys are thirsty in Atlanta, and there's beer in Texarkana.
[01:25:35.099 --> 01:25:36.160]  And we'll bring
[01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:45.987]  To answer that last caller's question.
[01:25:48.669 --> 01:25:54.936]  I will do that and then we will go back to your phone calls and some economic news that I haven't covered yet.
[01:25:54.996 --> 01:25:55.496]  But first!
[01:25:56.533 --> 01:25:57.974]  I like this one little part coming up.
[01:25:58.054 --> 01:25:59.294]  No, I don't have time to play the song.
[01:25:59.814 --> 01:26:01.415]  Old Smokey's got his ears on.
[01:26:02.095 --> 01:26:03.095]  He's hot on your tail.
[01:26:03.115 --> 01:26:05.416]  And he ain't gonna rest till you're in jail.
[01:26:05.776 --> 01:26:07.757]  So you got to dodge him, you got to duck him.
[01:26:08.157 --> 01:26:09.598]  You gotta keep that diesel truckin'.
[01:26:09.878 --> 01:26:12.038]  So let that hammer down and give it hell!
[01:26:13.039 --> 01:26:13.479]  Alright.
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:18.861]  Little Alex Jones karaoke, uh, torture for everybody.
[01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:26.611]  You know, so what?
[01:26:28.111 --> 01:26:33.614]  I would talk about this type of news 13 years ago, and most people would laugh at me.
[01:26:34.214 --> 01:26:36.615]  And then about 10 years ago, about half the people would laugh at me.
[01:26:37.176 --> 01:26:39.597]  And then about 3 years ago, 10% of the people would laugh at me.
[01:26:40.317 --> 01:26:43.719]  And now, I do radio talk shows every week where people are attacking me.
[01:26:43.739 --> 01:26:46.920]  The host is attacking me, and every single caller calls in and agrees.
[01:26:48.421 --> 01:26:49.202]  And the host gets mad.
[01:26:50.462 --> 01:26:52.583]  Canada, England, the United States.
[01:26:53.724 --> 01:26:54.044]  Period.
[01:26:57.111 --> 01:27:00.594]  So, let people continue to attack.
[01:27:01.094 --> 01:27:02.035]  They've all been proven wrong.
[01:27:02.075 --> 01:27:03.376]  Everything we've talked about has happened.
[01:27:03.596 --> 01:27:07.139]  And I say unfortunately, because I wish we could have turned all this around.
[01:27:07.239 --> 01:27:13.283]  I wish I wasn't right about all this, but I was reading Rand Corporation documents, CFR documents, declassified CIA documents.
[01:27:13.303 --> 01:27:13.964]  That's what I do.
[01:27:15.225 --> 01:27:17.507]  And so I know what was going to happen, so I've been proven right.
[01:27:17.747 --> 01:27:20.089]  So my stock goes up, mainstream media stock goes down.
[01:27:20.849 --> 01:27:22.711]  And it goes for the entire alternative media.
[01:27:23.746 --> 01:27:27.848]  There's a lot of bull out there in alternative media as well, but people learn what to trust and what not to trust.
[01:27:27.868 --> 01:27:30.970]  People know the government's out there with disinfo on the internet now, attacking people.
[01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:31.690]  That's now admitted.
[01:27:32.110 --> 01:27:33.351]  Wasn't before, now it's admitted.
[01:27:33.371 --> 01:27:34.912]  My stock goes up again, I told people.
[01:27:35.812 --> 01:27:37.153]  Pentagon admits they go after me.
[01:27:37.353 --> 01:27:42.976]  They show 9-11 truth groups in Congress saying these are terrorists, we've got to shut down the web because of them.
[01:27:43.316 --> 01:27:45.397]  People hear that and just come and check us out even more.
[01:27:46.952 --> 01:27:54.197]  So, fortune does favor the bold, and the fortune we're looking for is liberty and freedom, and as things get darker and darker, more serious folks are going to wake up.
[01:27:54.257 --> 01:27:55.818]  So, understand something.
[01:27:55.938 --> 01:28:08.948]  It was about 2% that started the Revolutionary War against the British because of their abuses in 1775, and then it kicked off officially in 1776, and only 5% were involved for the entire war against the British.
[01:28:09.898 --> 01:28:11.539]  The majority of people were Tories!
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:13.121]  They were for the system!
[01:28:13.541 --> 01:28:19.667]  George Washington just wasn't fighting the British, the greatest army ever in the world, never been defeated in ground fights.
[01:28:20.107 --> 01:28:25.231]  He was fighting the people who were mainly British, who wanted to go along as cowards.
[01:28:26.593 --> 01:28:31.457]  Now by the time they started winning, seven years in, around 20% of the public then started saying they were for it.
[01:28:31.817 --> 01:28:35.500]  Guess what happened to hundreds of thousands of people who've been prominent for the British?
[01:28:37.231 --> 01:28:38.052]  They were very nice.
[01:28:38.132 --> 01:28:40.374]  The founders let them sell their property for value.
[01:28:40.414 --> 01:28:43.798]  Gave them a year to get out and said, go to Canada or go to England.
[01:28:44.018 --> 01:28:44.719]  Get out of here.
[01:28:45.139 --> 01:28:46.340]  Leave or we're going to hang you.
[01:28:47.802 --> 01:28:50.625]  Because they had engaged in all sorts of atrocities, killing people, murdering.
[01:28:50.645 --> 01:28:52.727]  Some of you have seen that movie, The Patriots.
[01:28:52.747 --> 01:28:53.368]  It's a true story.
[01:28:53.688 --> 01:28:54.689]  Burning them up in the church.
[01:28:55.290 --> 01:28:56.331]  They did that all over the place.
[01:28:57.552 --> 01:28:58.893]  Concentration camps, you name it.
[01:29:00.183 --> 01:29:03.925]  So, we've got more than 5% here in the Info War.
[01:29:03.965 --> 01:29:05.066]  We don't want it to become physical.
[01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:07.207]  But if we have to defend ourselves, that's the way it is.
[01:29:07.687 --> 01:29:08.868]  We've got 5% of the public.
[01:29:08.888 --> 01:29:11.129]  We've got probably 10% that really knows what's going on.
[01:29:11.569 --> 01:29:13.250]  Just a lot of them are scared and aren't in the fight yet.
[01:29:14.551 --> 01:29:24.656]  If you look at the abolitionist movement in 1800, you can go pull these numbers up, less than 2% of the British population were abolitionists, less than 2% of the American population here in the United States. 2%!
[01:29:27.233 --> 01:29:33.736]  Go forward 60-something years, and they were now the majority in the South, the majority in the North, and the minority in the South.
[01:29:34.456 --> 01:29:37.898]  But the point is only, what, 3% of people in the South owned slaves.
[01:29:37.918 --> 01:29:38.858]  That was a minority.
[01:29:39.318 --> 01:29:41.139]  They were the only ones at the end that were actually for it.
[01:29:41.599 --> 01:29:50.123]  But you're talking about the vast minority just 60-something years later who were for slavery, and it was outlawed with the Emancipation Proclamation.
[01:29:50.623 --> 01:29:53.264]  So you can look at that 2% in the North,
[01:29:54.970 --> 01:30:01.315]  In 1800, and people laughing at them, people saying they were idiots, they had no power, it was a joke, they were fools.
[01:30:02.757 --> 01:30:14.066]  But you saw England outlaw slavery, you saw Latin America, the countries down there outlawed by the 1830s and 40s depending on the nation, you see Mexico outlaw slavery, you see slavery being outlawed all over the world.
[01:30:15.748 --> 01:30:18.890]  You saw slavery being outlawed in areas of Asia.
[01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:19.710]  Separately.
[01:30:19.730 --> 01:30:21.811]  You know, that was Asians with Asian slaves.
[01:30:22.371 --> 01:30:23.452]  They call it the caste system.
[01:30:23.932 --> 01:30:25.173]  Where do you still have slavery today?
[01:30:25.313 --> 01:30:25.613]  India.
[01:30:26.673 --> 01:30:27.134]  Only place.
[01:30:27.214 --> 01:30:28.414]  And it's the color of your skin.
[01:30:28.694 --> 01:30:29.515]  It's a caste system.
[01:30:30.712 --> 01:30:36.454]  Because Europeans, about 4,000 years ago, came into Northern India and they set up a caste system there.
[01:30:36.814 --> 01:30:38.074]  That's what groups always do to each other.
[01:30:39.495 --> 01:30:42.636]  They've got caste systems in Africa where one tribe that's bigger has the other.
[01:30:42.696 --> 01:30:45.197]  That's how humans, when they get out of control, operate.
[01:30:45.777 --> 01:30:48.638]  So people can sit here all day and say, oh, you're not going to do anything, Alex.
[01:30:48.858 --> 01:30:49.778]  You're not going to affect change.
[01:30:49.858 --> 01:30:50.138]  Bull!
[01:30:50.898 --> 01:30:52.259]  I'm just one person in this fight.
[01:30:52.719 --> 01:30:55.660]  I'm just one little piece of the fight against corruption and tyranny.
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:02.823]  And I know that as you wake up others and as the enemy squeezes tighter and tighter, we have the moral ground.
[01:31:02.863 --> 01:31:06.125]  I don't care how much propaganda the establishment has, how much spin they've got.
[01:31:06.145 --> 01:31:12.147]  The police running around in black uniforms tasering people and cameras in schoolrooms and bathrooms is tyranny and it's wrong.
[01:31:14.451 --> 01:31:17.373]  Private offshore banks looting the country and setting up tyrannies wrong.
[01:31:17.973 --> 01:31:19.454]  And it's going to fall.
[01:31:19.794 --> 01:31:22.716]  The question is, how far will the tyranny get before it falls?
[01:31:23.517 --> 01:31:25.698]  And so, just saying, nobody's going to do anything.
[01:31:25.958 --> 01:31:26.859]  People are doing things.
[01:31:26.879 --> 01:31:27.739]  People are doing a lot.
[01:31:27.979 --> 01:31:33.203]  We'd be in a lot worse situation right now if people hadn't stood up to tyranny and hadn't warned folks.
[01:31:33.243 --> 01:31:36.585]  What if people 10, 15, 20 years ago, talking about the New World Order, hadn't done what they did?
[01:31:36.885 --> 01:31:38.466]  We wouldn't have all this credibility right now.
[01:31:40.595 --> 01:31:41.856]  But we told everybody it was going to happen.
[01:31:42.116 --> 01:31:42.637]  We were right.
[01:31:42.957 --> 01:31:44.899]  The enemy moved forward and now people are listening.
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:52.706]  So it's up to us now, as we see everything unfolding, not to whine and complain and bitch about it, but to say, OK, we were right, let's do something about it.
[01:31:53.066 --> 01:31:56.089]  To all the people on the fence, OK, you didn't believe FEMA camps were real?
[01:31:56.269 --> 01:31:57.430]  Here it is in a bunch of newspapers.
[01:31:57.670 --> 01:32:00.113]  OK, you didn't believe that the WMDs were staged?
[01:32:00.133 --> 01:32:00.873]  Well, now it's admitted.
[01:32:01.134 --> 01:32:04.397]  OK, well, you didn't believe that a Barack Obama was going to keep the secret arrests and torture going?
[01:32:04.617 --> 01:32:05.738]  Here's his own executive order.
[01:32:07.165 --> 01:32:08.728]  You don't believe the mainstream media is lying?
[01:32:08.929 --> 01:32:10.231]  They told you he got rid of this!
[01:32:10.432 --> 01:32:11.694]  Here is WhiteHouse.gov!
[01:32:11.875 --> 01:32:12.296]  Here it is!
[01:32:12.336 --> 01:32:13.197]  He didn't do that!
[01:32:13.418 --> 01:32:14.219]  He lied to you!
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:15.943]  Now what are you going to do about that?
[01:32:16.143 --> 01:32:17.226]  What are you going to say about that?
[01:32:20.538 --> 01:32:23.201]  And there's thousands of other issues, and I could rant all day about it.
[01:32:23.281 --> 01:32:24.102]  So, look.
[01:32:24.242 --> 01:32:25.383]  Keep the attacks going.
[01:32:25.664 --> 01:32:26.725]  Keep lying about me.
[01:32:26.765 --> 01:32:27.686]  Keep doing everything you're doing.
[01:32:27.706 --> 01:32:28.527]  Just spell my name right.
[01:32:28.567 --> 01:32:33.352]  It's A-L-E-X-J-O-N-E-S-InfoWars.com-PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:32:34.153 --> 01:32:35.054]  Just keep attacking.
[01:32:35.114 --> 01:32:36.175]  Just keep it going.
[01:32:36.595 --> 01:32:38.518]  Please, I want you to intensify it.
[01:32:38.918 --> 01:32:41.140]  More, more, more, more.
[01:32:41.461 --> 01:32:42.282]  Give me more.
[01:32:43.649 --> 01:32:47.012]  Because all your curses and all your attacks are just blessings to me in the end.
[01:32:47.292 --> 01:32:50.014]  God just turns it right around and turns it into something good.
[01:32:50.034 --> 01:32:50.635]  So just please!
[01:32:52.516 --> 01:32:58.221]  If you strike me down, and I don't want that to happen because I've got work to do, but even if they strike me down, that just gets bigger!
[01:32:59.562 --> 01:33:00.603]  What did Thomas Jefferson say?
[01:33:00.643 --> 01:33:05.967]  The tree of liberty must be nourished from time to time, must be fed, must be watered.
[01:33:07.048 --> 01:33:10.991]  The tree of liberty must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[01:33:14.212 --> 01:33:15.473]  So understand that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:15.773 --> 01:33:16.933]  That's why they probably won't kill me.
[01:33:17.174 --> 01:33:20.515]  They'll destroy me in the media.
[01:33:20.655 --> 01:33:22.296]  But there's not much to go after me on.
[01:33:22.777 --> 01:33:23.797]  I'm a pretty boring guy.
[01:33:25.298 --> 01:33:26.659]  So they'll try to manufacture stuff.
[01:33:27.299 --> 01:33:28.059]  That doesn't work anymore.
[01:33:28.079 --> 01:33:29.220]  People know they're a pack of liars.
[01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:33.922]  Look at Blagojevich, a complete open criminal, and people are defending him because they know he's the underdog.
[01:33:34.142 --> 01:33:38.685]  They know the system's so corrupt that even though that guy's corrupt, he must have done something against them.
[01:33:41.417 --> 01:33:42.797]  The system is shot, folks.
[01:33:42.857 --> 01:33:44.058]  It's got to be reworked.
[01:33:44.118 --> 01:33:45.098]  It's got to be recreated.
[01:33:45.438 --> 01:33:47.999]  Real change, not phony, Obamanoid change.
[01:33:48.259 --> 01:33:49.079]  Obama!
[01:33:49.359 --> 01:33:51.379]  Obama!
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.720]  Bush!
[01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:58.741]  You got all these neocons now, all these super right-wing people saying, I like Obama.
[01:33:58.961 --> 01:34:02.882]  Yeah, he's starting new wars, encircling Russia, setting up a police state.
[01:34:02.902 --> 01:34:03.442]  They love him!
[01:34:03.683 --> 01:34:05.083]  Pat Robertson's endorsed him!
[01:34:07.210 --> 01:34:08.591]  What does that tell you out there?
[01:34:09.191 --> 01:34:10.772]  That means they're making their move with this guy.
[01:34:11.393 --> 01:34:15.576]  And so am I going to wimp out and wait until people wake up to him to attack him and go after him politically?
[01:34:15.616 --> 01:34:15.816]  No!
[01:34:16.276 --> 01:34:17.517]  I'm stepping right up to the President.
[01:34:17.537 --> 01:34:20.219]  They know that I've produced some of the most viral videos in history.
[01:34:20.479 --> 01:34:21.780]  Hundreds of millions of views online.
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:23.841]  They'll probably try all kinds of crap.
[01:34:23.861 --> 01:34:25.002]  We've had all sorts of stuff going on.
[01:34:25.242 --> 01:34:25.583]  Good!
[01:34:26.423 --> 01:34:27.944]  I'm here to fight the New World Order.
[01:34:28.144 --> 01:34:30.504]  I'm not here to suck my thumb and play games.
[01:34:30.804 --> 01:34:42.668]  I'm here to go toe-to-toe 110% and they may kick my butt in the ring, but I'm here in the ring, and you better believe this, you attack my liberty, you attack my freedom, you attack my country, you attack my family, I'm gonna fight back.
[01:34:43.088 --> 01:34:46.469]  And you may beat me, but you better believe I'm gonna keep swinging all the way.
[01:34:48.544 --> 01:34:50.885]  And I kick like a mule and I bite like a crocodile.
[01:34:51.426 --> 01:34:52.747]  And so do the American people.
[01:34:53.067 --> 01:34:57.990]  So we need to come together against the New World Order and stop forgetting race, religion, all the stuff we fight about.
[01:34:58.610 --> 01:35:02.473]  We need to agree on liberty and freedom and the destruction of tyranny in the New World Order.
[01:35:04.714 --> 01:35:07.076]  Let's go ahead and talk to who's up next here, Annie in New York.
[01:35:09.877 --> 01:35:10.578]  Hello, Alex.
[01:35:10.958 --> 01:35:11.398]  Hi, Annie.
[01:35:11.919 --> 01:35:12.859]  I think you're wonderful.
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:16.822]  I was working the night that you were
[01:35:17.694 --> 01:35:22.237]  You went after Geraldo, and I worked in the McGraw-Hill building, and I watched that whole thing.
[01:35:22.277 --> 01:35:23.618]  It was quite amazing.
[01:35:23.819 --> 01:35:24.759]  Did you watch it out the window?
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:25.480]  Yeah.
[01:35:26.981 --> 01:35:27.942]  I was working.
[01:35:27.962 --> 01:35:30.063]  300 demonstrators taking over their live broadcast.
[01:35:30.103 --> 01:35:30.664]  That was beautiful.
[01:35:30.964 --> 01:35:31.905]  It was great!
[01:35:32.045 --> 01:35:32.785]  It was wonderful.
[01:35:33.326 --> 01:35:35.387]  But I wanted to ask you a couple of things.
[01:35:35.447 --> 01:35:38.309]  I mean, it's so difficult for people.
[01:35:38.429 --> 01:35:40.311]  I'm one of eight, you know, children.
[01:35:40.351 --> 01:35:43.393]  I'm a baby boomer, but, you know, I've been following this stuff.
[01:35:43.413 --> 01:35:46.736]  I used to work for FEMA, and I'm following this stuff for years.
[01:35:47.284 --> 01:35:47.604]  Thank you.
[01:36:06.035 --> 01:36:09.717]  I get scared that this might be the make or break year, 2009.
[01:36:09.877 --> 01:36:17.500]  That's because subconsciously, they know it's true, they're afraid, so they go, uh-uh, no, no, everything's fine, uh-uh, no, no, everything, I don't want to hear it.
[01:36:18.061 --> 01:36:23.263]  I mean, I've seen people, I've had family, cousins and people over, and I've tried to give them a DVD and they act like it's a snake.
[01:36:23.563 --> 01:36:25.284]  Oh, no, God, no, I don't want, you know why?
[01:36:25.304 --> 01:36:26.124]  Because they know it's real.
[01:36:26.865 --> 01:36:27.365]  But go ahead.
[01:36:27.905 --> 01:36:33.668]  I appreciate that point of view, because when I tried to get people to watch Loose Change,
[01:36:34.355 --> 01:36:39.919]  It was almost like they were little kids, and they were breaking one of the church commandments, and they were going to get caught.
[01:36:39.939 --> 01:36:42.581]  They were so afraid, but they did watch it.
[01:36:42.821 --> 01:36:48.484]  Well, that's a good way to get our material out, because it is avant-garde, it is cutting-edge, it is underground, it is dangerous.
[01:36:48.504 --> 01:36:51.266]  You tell them, this is a super-suppressed video, which it is.
[01:36:51.286 --> 01:36:58.151]  They're trying to erase them and shut down Endgame, Terror Storm, all these powerful films, and you tell them, well, this is hardcore, and they'll run home and, you know.
[01:37:00.127 --> 01:37:02.088]  Anything else?
[01:37:02.308 --> 01:37:13.715]  It would be helpful if one of your writers, you know, like the Five Steps of Grieving, there's also a process like that akin with coming to grips with what the heck is going on.
[01:37:14.475 --> 01:37:15.856]  You know, and anger.
[01:37:15.916 --> 01:37:16.917]  I feel a lot of anger.
[01:37:16.997 --> 01:37:19.958]  I'm over the shock between your stuff and crossing the Rubicon.
[01:37:19.998 --> 01:37:24.341]  And I really like that new site that you, the August review.
[01:37:24.381 --> 01:37:25.441]  That was very helpful.
[01:37:25.501 --> 01:37:28.043]  But it would be great if somebody could put together
[01:37:28.615 --> 01:37:34.392]  You know, the steps of not grieving, but coming to grips with the horrible... Ma'am, we're trying to expand.
[01:37:34.432 --> 01:37:35.455]  We've got three riders.
[01:37:36.598 --> 01:37:40.619]  that are full-time, a couple that are part-time, and some folks that are guest contributors that we appreciate.
[01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:45.341]  We're trying to expand, and we're doing it while everything's imploding.
[01:37:45.721 --> 01:37:47.362]  So yes, we're trying to do that.
[01:37:47.402 --> 01:37:48.342]  We're going to add a lot.
[01:37:48.362 --> 01:37:50.223]  In the next few months, people are going to see it.
[01:37:50.243 --> 01:37:52.724]  A set of two films a year, three, four films a year.
[01:37:54.384 --> 01:37:54.904]  Well, just wait.
[01:37:54.924 --> 01:37:56.545]  You're going to see some new things happening here.
[01:37:57.085 --> 01:37:58.305]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:37:59.326 --> 01:38:05.648]  I wonder if you think that peak oil will play any role in putting the, you know,
[01:38:06.331 --> 01:38:08.974]  Kibosh to their global movement.
[01:38:09.134 --> 01:38:10.355]  I mean... It's contrary.
[01:38:10.395 --> 01:38:15.100]  You know, when you mention Rupert, he would talk about 98% accurate, and he would add some things.
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:17.262]  You know, Rupert called for population reduction, right?
[01:38:18.162 --> 01:38:19.063]  I did not know that.
[01:38:19.083 --> 01:38:20.024]  Yeah, he wrote that.
[01:38:21.145 --> 01:38:26.430]  And has given speeches on it, and he kind of... He's retired, I guess, to put it lightly these days.
[01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:36.211]  Peak oil is actually, they want to reduce resources to control the population, but certainly
[01:38:39.124 --> 01:38:43.889]  Well, let's just put it this way, PECOIL is one area that I think you should look at the alternatives on and research, okay?
[01:38:44.209 --> 01:38:45.010]  Good to hear from you, though.
[01:38:45.050 --> 01:38:46.632]  Great to have you on board with us as a listener.
[01:38:47.092 --> 01:38:51.176]  I'm going to come back, I'm going to plug these sponsors, then I'm going to go to some more of your calls.
[01:38:51.577 --> 01:38:53.078]  I do have some economic news I want to hit.
[01:38:53.158 --> 01:39:00.646]  All these top economists are talking about we are already in a depression, even The Economist magazine, which is as prestigious as it gets.
[01:39:03.004 --> 01:39:04.165]  It's economists that write it.
[01:39:04.405 --> 01:39:08.668]  It's kind of a prestigious internal journal that's sold on newsstands.
[01:39:09.289 --> 01:39:11.511]  I mean, these are actual white papers, you know, that are in it.
[01:39:11.911 --> 01:39:17.235]  And they're saying that... And I've got a few other economic stories I wanted to hit on.
[01:39:18.116 --> 01:39:24.140]  But before I do that, I had one more sponsor that I wanted to tell folks about that is making this show possible.
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:25.181]  Plus, they're just great folks.
[01:39:25.201 --> 01:39:28.364]  And that's efoodsdirect.com, the J. Michael Stevens Group.
[01:39:28.704 --> 01:39:31.246]  The website is just the letter E, foodsdirect.com.
[01:39:33.977 --> 01:39:38.221]  And they have a deal going for, I'm told, just a few more weeks where you can get a sampler pack.
[01:39:38.261 --> 01:39:40.883]  It's a three-day responder kit, is what it's called.
[01:39:40.923 --> 01:39:48.690]  It's large servings for one person for three days for $21 of high-quality, non-GMO food.
[01:39:49.802 --> 01:39:50.983]  And just try it.
[01:39:51.023 --> 01:39:54.585]  It's the 3-Day Responder, 3-Day, 1 Adult Food Supply for only $21.95.
[01:39:56.206 --> 01:39:56.506]  Give.
[01:39:56.887 --> 01:39:57.907]  This is at cost, by the way.
[01:39:57.927 --> 01:39:58.928]  They're doing this as a promotion.
[01:39:59.548 --> 01:40:01.850]  And then decide to get a year's supply or 6-month supply.
[01:40:01.890 --> 01:40:08.094]  They have a boogie pack, 1-month supply for an adult that just is in a box about this big that just fits in your trunk.
[01:40:11.776 --> 01:40:15.538]  Again, efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633.
[01:40:15.578 --> 01:40:21.462]  They have a lot of great videos and material as well for free on their website about the products.
[01:40:21.482 --> 01:40:22.723]  They're the longest continually operating.
[01:40:22.943 --> 01:40:24.304]  They're the biggest horrible foods company.
[01:40:24.524 --> 01:40:26.625]  They're the folks I trust, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:40:26.825 --> 01:40:27.826]  They're patriots like us.
[01:40:28.226 --> 01:40:30.808]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to another phone call here.
[01:40:31.608 --> 01:40:34.430]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ronnie in Texas.
[01:40:34.890 --> 01:40:36.151]  Ronnie, you're on the air.
[01:40:36.211 --> 01:40:36.551]  Welcome.
[01:40:37.232 --> 01:40:38.172]  Thank you, sir, Alex.
[01:40:38.592 --> 01:40:39.513]  Help support our troops.
[01:40:40.086 --> 01:40:47.191]  decriminalize medicinal marijuana because many of our brave troops experience traumatic brain injuries, TBI, from IEDs.
[01:40:47.271 --> 01:40:57.459]  And all the studies of major medical institutions, not the marijuana lobby, the ragtag lobby, but major studies say it is great for brain trauma, great for PTSD.
[01:40:57.499 --> 01:41:05.525]  They've done placebo tests with Prozac and sugar pill, and Prozac is actually bad for PTSD, but they put them on it when marijuana helps them.
[01:41:05.985 --> 01:41:08.666]  And I totally agree with you, and again, I'm not a marijuana guy.
[01:41:08.686 --> 01:41:16.748]  I mean, I've smoked marijuana before, and every few years I'll go, I'll be at an event or something, I'll go, okay, and then I go, oh, now I remember why I don't smoke this.
[01:41:17.128 --> 01:41:18.068]  You know, I don't like this.
[01:41:18.949 --> 01:41:22.250]  But, you know, I really think that, well, I mean, I agree with you.
[01:41:22.710 --> 01:41:31.292]  Well, the point I want to try to make now is the time for our returning troops to have medicinal marijuana, because it's at least an option to help them in their recovery from TBIs.
[01:41:31.712 --> 01:41:34.473]  And it's so crucial, I mean, we want, everybody wants to help our troops.
[01:41:35.051 --> 01:41:42.178]  And there's the reason I think that we're going to put this medicinal marijuana issue over the line, because who doesn't want to help our troops?
[01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:48.685]  You know why glaucoma, glaucoma is pressure in the eye, inflammation inside that makes you go blind.
[01:41:49.106 --> 01:41:53.530]  It's the number one treatment now, the most effective, THC drops in the eye.
[01:41:54.671 --> 01:41:58.692]  And my grandmother even had glaucoma and they gave her those drops and it worked for her.
[01:41:59.212 --> 01:42:00.052]  And so why is that?
[01:42:00.572 --> 01:42:01.793]  The eyes are part of the brain.
[01:42:02.393 --> 01:42:10.335]  They grow out in the embryonic development and a lot of times the person also has inflammation of the brain from MSG, aspartame, fluoride, things in the water.
[01:42:10.715 --> 01:42:18.997]  And that's why with brain injuries, some brain injuries, not all of them, they found that marijuana is good because it does reduce brain inflammation, swelling.
[01:42:19.577 --> 01:42:20.738]  Just like it does for the eye.
[01:42:21.018 --> 01:42:26.263]  And so I guess you've done your research that yes, marijuana is medicinal with brain swelling and inflammation.
[01:42:26.623 --> 01:42:34.069]  I know from my own experience, distilled cannabis essential oil has been found to be a cure-all for many ailments.
[01:42:34.109 --> 01:42:36.932]  There are a few plants that you can really call wondrous.
[01:42:37.952 --> 01:42:43.917]  And none of them stand above, you know, not the plant they get bare aspirin out of, not Malalugo or not
[01:42:45.424 --> 01:42:46.105]  Nothing compares.
[01:42:46.745 --> 01:42:48.707]  I mean, not the aloe vera plant.
[01:42:48.747 --> 01:42:54.852]  Marijuana is, I've seen all the studies, it's just an absolutely fantastic thing and that's why it's banned in this country.
[01:42:55.292 --> 01:42:57.634]  Because the globalists don't want you having access to real health care.
[01:42:57.894 --> 01:42:58.835]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:43:00.544 --> 01:43:04.166]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:43:04.246 --> 01:43:09.849]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:43:09.969 --> 01:43:14.031]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:43:14.311 --> 01:43:16.593]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[01:43:16.773 --> 01:43:22.676]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[01:43:22.756 --> 01:43:23.256]  I don't know.
[01:43:40.251 --> 01:43:41.092]  It is a big idea.
[01:43:41.252 --> 01:43:42.072]  A new world order.
[01:43:42.092 --> 01:43:46.274]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:44:09.955 --> 01:44:12.097]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:44:12.798 --> 01:44:15.040]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:18.043]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:44:18.763 --> 01:44:26.090]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:44:29.121 --> 01:44:34.083]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:44:34.564 --> 01:44:38.025]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:44:38.425 --> 01:44:40.907]  Dillberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:44:40.987 --> 01:44:42.127]  Most people have no idea.
[01:44:42.147 --> 01:44:42.927]  They're not after money.
[01:44:42.947 --> 01:44:44.008]  They have all the money they need.
[01:44:44.208 --> 01:44:44.928]  They're after power.
[01:44:45.188 --> 01:44:46.209]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[01:44:46.349 --> 01:44:50.871]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[01:46:07.262 --> 01:46:08.223]  I'll have to get to you tomorrow.
[01:46:08.263 --> 01:46:09.944]  I've got some final news I need to hit.
[01:46:09.964 --> 01:46:11.785]  And then rebroadcast is coming up.
[01:46:12.146 --> 01:46:15.909]  By the way, we do have Professor Griff of Public Enemy on Thursday.
[01:46:17.069 --> 01:46:19.231]  So that is coming up Thursday.
[01:46:19.251 --> 01:46:22.053]  He's on the road right now.
[01:46:22.093 --> 01:46:22.534]  I'm listening.
[01:46:22.554 --> 01:46:23.915]  I want to say hi to Professor Griff.
[01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:25.861]  Let's be interesting.
[01:46:27.181 --> 01:46:30.704]  Any other big hip-hop folks want to call us, come on the show and talk about Obama and the New World Order?
[01:46:31.464 --> 01:46:34.066]  Just email Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:46:34.106 --> 01:46:35.047]  Two ways we'd love to have you.
[01:46:35.747 --> 01:46:37.689]  Any other rock and roll folks, Hollywood people?
[01:46:37.709 --> 01:46:40.070]  You know, they call me all the time, but they're just scared to come on.
[01:46:40.311 --> 01:46:42.172]  They just want to touch base, say they appreciate what we're doing.
[01:46:42.232 --> 01:46:45.914]  But it helps to have a lot of people from every genre on, because that just expands it.
[01:46:47.596 --> 01:46:50.758]  Now, worst January on record for stocks.
[01:46:52.512 --> 01:46:53.833]  That's out of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:46:53.953 --> 01:46:56.356]  GM to use bailout billion to invest in Brazil.
[01:46:56.376 --> 01:47:00.640]  They're going to use the money to build an automaker in Brazil.
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:03.182]  So they're going to use the money to move overseas.
[01:47:03.462 --> 01:47:09.268]  And I saw another one of the companies is going to use the money, it was GM too, to move to Mexico.
[01:47:09.628 --> 01:47:11.090]  So we're just paying for them to move!
[01:47:12.831 --> 01:47:15.534]  See, the government's so corrupt, anything they do isn't going to turn to good.
[01:47:17.140 --> 01:47:17.881]  And it's a diversion.
[01:47:17.901 --> 01:47:20.984]  $50 billion to the automakers, that's nothing.
[01:47:21.004 --> 01:47:27.109]  Or $850 billion for a new stimulus package, $255,000 per job to create a job.
[01:47:27.129 --> 01:47:31.093]  Those are going to be government jobs and control freak jobs and things they control.
[01:47:31.533 --> 01:47:34.076]  We're in trouble, folks, because these people are stealing it all.
[01:47:34.496 --> 01:47:38.500]  Everybody's scared in the crisis that the bankers created, so they're like, OK, go ahead and do it.
[01:47:39.986 --> 01:47:41.126]  Actually, a lot of folks were against it.
[01:47:41.467 --> 01:47:43.307]  The vast majority against the bailout, but it still happened.
[01:47:44.147 --> 01:47:49.909]  But I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up right here at the end of the show, because Ted, we can't count on the government.
[01:47:49.949 --> 01:47:51.150]  We know it's going down.
[01:47:51.230 --> 01:47:53.030]  Gold's shot up way over 900.
[01:47:53.490 --> 01:47:55.211]  And I talked to you this morning as I was out of town.
[01:47:55.231 --> 01:47:57.912]  You're telling me you're still offering prices from over a week ago?
[01:47:58.932 --> 01:47:59.814]  I don't know.
[01:48:15.695 --> 01:48:18.656]  Uh, that priced into the price of this gold when most places don't even have it.
[01:48:18.956 --> 01:48:25.418]  So I wanted to give folks an opportunity to get into something that has real, tangible assets as they're, uh, devaluing the dollar.
[01:48:25.438 --> 01:48:29.239]  So specifically, what are the coins you've got, and is this the last time you'll be able to give this offer?
[01:48:29.899 --> 01:48:31.480]  Right on, right on the target here.
[01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:35.461]  And if gold, uh, gold continues to rise, obviously I can't do it.
[01:48:35.481 --> 01:48:36.841]  I'll hold it till midnight tonight.
[01:48:37.341 --> 01:48:39.862]  But I do have the, uh, Frank currently right now at $217.
[01:48:40.542 --> 01:48:41.382]  I repriced them.
[01:48:41.463 --> 01:48:42.403]  Currently right now they'd be $228.
[01:48:43.766 --> 01:48:49.268]  The British Sovereign presently right now is at $2.65, and in today's market it's $2.79.
[01:48:49.488 --> 01:48:53.009]  I just completely sold out of the Buffaloes.
[01:48:53.389 --> 01:48:56.910]  The Silver Dimes are still available, but the Walking Liberty Halves are gone.
[01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:59.691]  The Silver Dimes right now are at $1.46.
[01:49:00.271 --> 01:49:05.192]  Plain old Silver Dollar shot up over $20 a piece, so you can't get those anymore.
[01:49:05.232 --> 01:49:08.413]  That Creature from Jekyll Island book, I do put them in there, and that's $26.45.
[01:49:10.919 --> 01:49:12.361]  We have a lot of really good deals.
[01:49:12.661 --> 01:49:15.224]  Alex, this gold and silver market's going nuts right now.
[01:49:15.245 --> 01:49:16.847]  A lot of people want to get in.
[01:49:17.267 --> 01:49:18.068]  Really good news.
[01:49:18.148 --> 01:49:23.435]  People are calling me from the Creature from Jekyll Island book, from Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh like crazy.
[01:49:23.835 --> 01:49:26.278]  I was thinking that they want answers.
[01:49:26.619 --> 01:49:29.803]  It's really refreshing to know that that is exactly what they're looking for.
[01:49:30.336 --> 01:49:31.378]  And I'm going to give it to them.
[01:49:31.638 --> 01:49:33.580]  And I'm going to bring them over and have them start listing to us.
[01:49:47.398 --> 01:49:47.819]  Yeah, right.
[01:49:47.839 --> 01:49:49.781]  I mean, now that the silver dollars have gone up, it is.
[01:49:49.841 --> 01:49:55.528]  It's just poking up there right around 60 bucks.
[01:49:55.568 --> 01:49:58.712]  That's a loss leader.
[01:49:58.732 --> 01:49:58.913]  800-686-2237.
[01:49:58.933 --> 01:49:58.993]  800-686-2237.
[01:49:59.013 --> 01:50:05.961]  You have francs, you have British sovereigns, you have dimes and silver at the price that you were giving with
[01:50:06.562 --> 01:50:08.684]  How much has the market gone up from that price?
[01:50:08.704 --> 01:50:10.926]  Well, it's gone up about a hundred bucks, like you say.
[01:50:10.946 --> 01:50:16.510]  And the silver, obviously not a hundred bucks, but certainly if you put a percentage on it, it's about ten percent or better.
[01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:18.552]  So things have gone up ten percent.
[01:50:18.572 --> 01:50:21.694]  You're giving them an offer priced in ten percent lower than the market.
[01:50:21.854 --> 01:50:24.236]  When most places are completely sold out, you're starting to sell out.
[01:50:24.517 --> 01:50:25.397]  Folks, give the brokers a call.
[01:50:25.417 --> 01:50:26.678]  They'll be there till midnight with this deal.
[01:50:26.698 --> 01:50:26.738]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:26.758 --> 01:50:27.019]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:27.059 --> 01:50:28.940]  Now, Fram and FM stations, we'll see you back tomorrow.
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:30.822]  If everybody else, retransmission starts now.

[01:50:56.758 --> 01:50:59.499]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:50:59.719 --> 01:51:02.560]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:07.462]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:51:07.702 --> 01:51:08.623]  If you simply prepare.
[01:51:08.824 --> 01:51:11.768]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
