[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:00.669]  Big Brother.
[00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:01.569]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:29.344 --> 00:00:30.426]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:31.907]  You want answers?
[00:00:32.688 --> 00:00:33.589]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.875]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:38.435 --> 00:00:42.480]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:57.224]  We are live, simulcasting the last two hours, the second half of the syndicated radio transmission at PrisonPlanet.tv, streaming live.
[00:00:57.264 --> 00:01:01.726]  We also archive it for PrisonPlanet.tv members as well.
[00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:06.648]  It is the second day of March 2009.
[00:01:10.748 --> 00:01:24.358]  Coming up later in the show, we are going to get into the fact that the Dow went below 7,000 today, and what's happening with the economy worldwide as Eastern Europe begins collapsing financially.
[00:01:24.378 --> 00:01:25.699]  Several governments over there have fallen.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.923]  I also want to get into designer baby fight over U.S.
[00:01:29.983 --> 00:01:33.726]  clinic, where you can choose blonde hair, blue eyes, brown hair, brown eyes.
[00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:40.339]  This is a lot of serious ramifications, and we're going to be going over that.
[00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:49.560]  But for the next 30 minutes or so, maybe longer, we are joined by Professor George Grayson.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:02:04.283]  And before we went to break, I went over his bio, written more than 20 books and other publications on international affairs, made 125 research trips to Latin America, publishes a weekly special report on what's happening in Mexico alone.
[00:02:05.243 --> 00:02:17.251]  And we really appreciate Professor George W. Grayson, a member of the Government Department faculty for 38 years, joining us, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
[00:02:17.812 --> 00:02:19.293]  Professor, it's good to have you on with us.
[00:02:20.013 --> 00:02:20.994]  Very nice to be with you.
[00:02:22.518 --> 00:02:23.519]  Let's go ahead and start.
[00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:31.044]  This is a short segment, but go ahead and break down from your great expertise, one of the most informed people out there, and what's really happening in Mexico.
[00:02:31.244 --> 00:02:34.266]  Are they in civil war, going towards civil war?
[00:02:34.407 --> 00:02:35.307]  Is it collapsing?
[00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:36.128]  Will it collapse?
[00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.751]  Mexico is not a failed state.
[00:02:41.412 --> 00:02:47.856]  That is, people go to work every morning, the subways run, the taxis pick up fares, and so forth.
[00:02:48.957 --> 00:02:50.418]  What is happening is that
[00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:57.105]  There are enclaves of violence where you have dual sovereignty.
[00:02:57.646 --> 00:03:09.874]  That is, on the one hand, the elected officials have a piece of the action, but they're often outmaneuvered and outgunned by the cartels.
[00:03:10.555 --> 00:03:15.618]  And you see this in cities like Juarez, which is just across the border from El Paso.
[00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:20.582]  You see it in Tijuana, just across the border from
[00:03:21.378 --> 00:03:32.804]  San Diego, and in areas and states like Guerrero and Michoacan, where the government simply has lost control over its own territory.
[00:03:34.724 --> 00:03:50.292]  And I see a lot of reports that all, especially on the border, but all over Mexico, that there's sub-taxing systems where the gangs and criminals demand taxes from businesses and teachers and even government people.
[00:03:51.591 --> 00:03:52.211]  That's right.
[00:03:53.092 --> 00:03:57.014]  And they don't just send you a notice if your tax is overdue.
[00:03:57.595 --> 00:03:58.275]  They shoot you.
[00:03:59.696 --> 00:04:13.944]  And they're not confining this to public entities, although some mayors are having to pay taxes to make certain that the citizens in their municipalities are not victimized.
[00:04:14.925 --> 00:04:17.046]  But surgeons are a target.
[00:04:17.146 --> 00:04:18.207]  Veterinarians
[00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:30.270]  Teachers, even street vendors, have to pay their Dane Geld, their dues, to the cartels or risk being executed.
[00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:42.402]  And as you've read, the executions are occurring in an increasingly ghastly fashion, with castrations and decapitations and shoving people in vats of lye.
[00:04:45.473 --> 00:04:49.117]  Wow, we're going to break in just a moment and I've already written quite a list of notes here.
[00:04:49.197 --> 00:04:58.486]  They have the separate taxes, it's totally lawless, the massive kidnapping and torture in what I would call real terrorism.
[00:04:59.147 --> 00:05:01.369]  Again, he's with the College of William & Mary.
[00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.792]  We're going to come right back to him after this quick three-minute break.
[00:05:05.832 --> 00:05:07.793]  Please stay with us.
[00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:34.799]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:45.827]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:05:46.207 --> 00:05:49.410]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.331]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:57.115]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[00:05:57.516 --> 00:06:02.719]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:12.727]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[00:06:13.147 --> 00:06:15.408]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[00:06:15.768 --> 00:06:21.110]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:06:21.931 --> 00:06:22.471]  You worry.
[00:06:22.831 --> 00:06:24.552]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:06:24.912 --> 00:06:27.133]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:29.354]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:06:29.674 --> 00:06:30.874]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:06:31.274 --> 00:06:34.476]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:06:34.876 --> 00:06:39.718]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:06:40.103 --> 00:06:43.426]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:06:44.087 --> 00:06:45.408]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:06:45.768 --> 00:06:48.370]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:51.633]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:06:52.134 --> 00:07:00.301]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:07:00.781 --> 00:07:05.145]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[00:07:05.575 --> 00:07:09.276]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[00:07:09.597 --> 00:07:13.578]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:07:13.598 --> 00:07:14.979]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:16.719]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:22.975]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:07:23.155 --> 00:07:24.615]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:07:24.895 --> 00:07:27.136]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:07:27.576 --> 00:07:32.318]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:35.579]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:39.360]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[00:07:39.818 --> 00:07:51.811]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system, which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:54.354]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[00:07:54.374 --> 00:07:55.675]  I use one every day.
[00:07:56.095 --> 00:07:58.498]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:07:58.858 --> 00:08:01.319]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:30.222 --> 00:08:33.396]  Professor George W. Grayson is our guest.
[00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.610]  Let me throw this question out at you.
[00:08:37.291 --> 00:08:59.448]  Homeland Security has said in Texas, both state and federal, I've had a state senator and a state rep on, and last week on the subject, quietly they say the National Guard is on one of its highest alerts, preparing to even have to shut down the border if they have to, that they believe there is a chance, they won't say on air, they say that's classified, but they say they know the percentage.
[00:09:00.589 --> 00:09:01.089]  They claim.
[00:09:01.669 --> 00:09:05.090]  But they say a good chance Mexico may completely collapse.
[00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:11.111]  From deeply studying this, Professor, do you think that's accurate?
[00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:13.311]  No, Mexico's not gonna collapse.
[00:09:14.051 --> 00:09:21.353]  And a major reason is that the Mexican military is by far the strongest force in the country.
[00:09:22.133 --> 00:09:27.034]  And it's completely loyal to President Felipe Calderon.
[00:09:27.854 --> 00:09:29.734]  But you are gonna see areas
[00:09:30.775 --> 00:09:41.501]  Where people flee the country, and Ciudad Juarez is a case in point, as is Nogales, Tijuana.
[00:09:42.522 --> 00:09:47.965]  Most of the border cities, the twin cities, are under a great deal of pressure.
[00:09:48.745 --> 00:09:55.429]  Now Alex, we can look on the bright side, because the Mexican economy is suffering even worse than ours.
[00:09:56.169 --> 00:09:59.251]  But there's one industry that's thriving along the border,
[00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:01.392]  And that's the funeral industry.
[00:10:02.373 --> 00:10:14.496]  And the current crop of morticians can't take care of all the bodies, and so funeral directors from other parts of the country are opening up branches.
[00:10:15.356 --> 00:10:19.558]  And in order to get a piece of the market, they have specials going.
[00:10:20.138 --> 00:10:27.960]  For example, if your loved one is decapitated and you've got the body, but you can't find the head,
[00:10:28.932 --> 00:10:30.514]  Wow, boy, don't tell me the bad news.
[00:10:51.826 --> 00:10:59.147]  I see different numbers in the press, kind of like the press says there's 14 illegal, 14 million illegal aliens, next they say there's 30 million in the US.
[00:10:59.507 --> 00:11:07.089]  I see numbers of 6,000, 8,000, 10,000 Mexicans that died last year in violence, and thousands already this year.
[00:11:07.429 --> 00:11:12.830]  What's, from your research, what's the closest number to how many people really died last year?
[00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:20.271]  Well, we have pretty good numbers on that, and while we're talking I'll pull up the exact number, but it's just over 6,000.
[00:11:22.029 --> 00:11:32.491]  And I think both the newspapers that are credible and also the authorities agree on that number.
[00:11:33.031 --> 00:11:45.773]  It looks like it's going to be larger this year, given the rapid start in executions we've had during the months of January and February.
[00:11:46.493 --> 00:11:49.294]  As far as the illegal immigrants go,
[00:11:50.323 --> 00:11:59.049]  If anybody's guess, I would say 12, 14,000 is probably a low figure.
[00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:06.873]  And we're going to see more pressure on the border, even though they're not jobs in the U.S.
[00:12:08.154 --> 00:12:18.861]  What we can appreciate is if you've got the choice of living in a country where there are no jobs, but the rule of law has broken down,
[00:12:19.813 --> 00:12:25.215]  Or trying to get into a country where there are no jobs, but we still have the rule of law.
[00:12:25.235 --> 00:12:31.818]  You really don't have to be a rocket scientist to make that choice.
[00:12:32.558 --> 00:12:39.981]  And therefore there's continuing pressure on people trying to get into the United States.
[00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:44.082]  By the way, I've just pulled up a number here which I think is accurate. 5,207.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.082]  Executions in 2008, 5,207.
[00:12:54.623 --> 00:12:58.425]  And so far this year, in the first two months, there's been 1,034.
[00:12:59.186 --> 00:13:01.367]  Wow.
[00:13:01.767 --> 00:13:02.927]  So a massive increase.
[00:13:02.967 --> 00:13:03.668]  What is that like?
[00:13:06.109 --> 00:13:13.973]  Well, if we multiply that by six, it's going to certainly be 1,000 or so more this year.
[00:13:14.613 --> 00:13:17.635]  But we've got elections in Mexico on
[00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:19.561]  I don't know.
[00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:55.768]  uh... surrounding uh... those uh... around that election period okay i have a good i have a million questions for you sir uh... sure if i was rambling oh no you're not rambling uh... believe me that this is all so important and excuse me for interrupting and i want to finish the point i just interrupted what you've really studied mexico when we were searching out the academics and you're one of the top academics from what we've uh... uh... researched you really understand the culture down there a
[00:13:57.709 --> 00:14:21.817]  Why does this culture allow corruption and the basic fact that Mordido or kickbacks or beak-dipping was allowed by the central government for so long and the fact that corruption was seen as okay, is that how it's now just grown and blossomed and gotten so much worse or are there other factors that are causing things to get much worse?
[00:14:23.097 --> 00:14:25.858]  Well, the ubiquitous poverty is a
[00:14:26.562 --> 00:14:27.362]  is a factor.
[00:14:27.382 --> 00:14:46.009]  The amount of red tape, it takes about 55 days to open even a small convenience store in Mexico City and that's 55 pieces of paper that need at least 55 signatures and you can see the opportunity for abuse there.
[00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:54.593]  It goes back to the colonial period when the viceroys would take the decrees from Madrid
[00:14:55.842 --> 00:15:11.014]  And they would put them over there, roll them up and put them over their head, and they would say, obadesco pero no cumplo, which means, I obey, but I'm not going to carry out the monarch's dictum because it would embarrass him or her.
[00:15:11.714 --> 00:15:23.003]  And so we've had a manipulative attitude toward law since the colonial period, if not before, and that's not going to change any time in our lifetimes.
[00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:32.475]  Who was more corrupt, just a point of history, the Spanish government or when they had the Germanic government in there with Maximilian?
[00:15:33.576 --> 00:15:35.857]  Well, Maximilian wasn't a bad guy.
[00:15:35.917 --> 00:15:52.226]  He was really a reformer, but it was such a blow to Mexican nationalism to have a Habsburg installed on the throne by Napoleon III that he, of course, was executed along with his wife Carlota.
[00:15:52.884 --> 00:16:00.728]  But I think he probably ran a pretty tight ship, but the forces were much greater than he.
[00:16:01.408 --> 00:16:10.592]  Okay, expanding on the point you were bringing up earlier about the elections coming up and the military attempting to dampen that down, in your words.
[00:16:11.112 --> 00:16:11.773]  Please continue.
[00:16:11.793 --> 00:16:21.017]  Well, the military is carrying the ball with regard to the so-called war on drugs, which I think is
[00:16:21.733 --> 00:16:31.955]  An unfortunate metaphor because a war suggests that there's something you can win and there's not going to be any victory against the drug cartels.
[00:16:32.915 --> 00:16:41.497]  You may be able to manage the violence more and manage the drug trade, but it's not going to be extinguished.
[00:16:42.477 --> 00:16:49.038]  But the military's role is not just in terms of their professional responsibilities.
[00:16:49.830 --> 00:17:00.355]  But many retired generals are now becoming the secretaries of public security or police chiefs in states and in large cities.
[00:17:01.235 --> 00:17:10.259]  And so we're seeing a militarization of law enforcement as well as the military playing its traditional role.
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:17.923]  That doesn't mean there's going to be a coup d'etat or that the military is going to take over, but the military
[00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:18.610]  It's
[00:17:38.804 --> 00:17:40.665]  They tossed the ball to the military.
[00:17:40.985 --> 00:17:41.925]  Well, that's what I've noticed.
[00:17:42.706 --> 00:17:43.966]  I go down to Mexico a few times a year.
[00:17:43.986 --> 00:17:44.867]  I won't be going back.
[00:17:45.287 --> 00:17:53.951]  And there's just troops everywhere, boarded up shops everywhere, even in the South, even in the supposedly nicer areas down in the Yucatan Peninsula.
[00:17:54.871 --> 00:17:58.613]  I've got reports here about killings in Cancun out of the Los Angeles Times.
[00:18:00.173 --> 00:18:02.194]  Now the State Department is saying it's dangerous down there.
[00:18:02.254 --> 00:18:03.355]  Colleges, as you know.
[00:18:03.855 --> 00:18:06.676]  For the audience are telling people watch out if you go down there.
[00:18:07.056 --> 00:18:10.836]  How dangerous is it for the average American or Canadian to go down to Mexico right now?
[00:18:12.917 --> 00:18:20.719]  Most of the civilians who get caught up in the violence just happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.
[00:18:21.739 --> 00:18:24.059]  There's no targeting of civilians.
[00:18:24.759 --> 00:18:27.680]  There's certainly no targeting of foreigners.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.101]  So I wouldn't have any, in fact I'm going to Mexico next week.
[00:18:32.762 --> 00:18:35.804]  But I have no qualms about going to Mexico City.
[00:18:35.824 --> 00:18:40.446]  I love cities like Queretaro or Zacatecas.
[00:18:41.306 --> 00:18:44.828]  If you get into the resort areas, you're pretty well cocooned.
[00:18:45.048 --> 00:18:46.229]  What about kidnapping, though?
[00:18:46.249 --> 00:18:47.409]  That is exploding, isn't it?
[00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:52.932]  Yeah, all kinds of kidnapping is exploding.
[00:18:53.012 --> 00:18:58.995]  I mean, there's the genuine kidnapping where somebody is grabbed off the street.
[00:18:59.636 --> 00:19:12.622]  But also, Alex, you might be at your desk and you get a phone call and someone says, I'm holding your 15-year-old daughter who just left St.
[00:19:12.702 --> 00:19:24.948]  Ignatius Prep School and if you want to see her back, then a man's going to come by your office in 10 minutes and you better give him $1,000.
[00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:46.537]  The person may not have your daughter, but you try to reach her on the cell phone, and you can't, she's not at home, and so you're likely to pony up a thousand dollars because the danger is so widespread that you can't take chances.
[00:19:48.318 --> 00:19:52.421]  And then the guy shows up and gets the money, but then your daughter shows up and really wasn't kidnapped.
[00:19:52.761 --> 00:19:53.742]  That's right.
[00:19:57.335 --> 00:20:00.257]  I can't imagine, like, do I pay or do I kill this person?
[00:20:00.457 --> 00:20:01.598]  How do I control myself?
[00:20:02.839 --> 00:20:04.440]  I just can't imagine being put in that position.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.020]  Stay there, sir.
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:05.621]  We've got a break.
[00:20:05.641 --> 00:20:07.422]  There's so many other questions I've got for you.
[00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:09.624]  Where do you see this going?
[00:20:09.664 --> 00:20:10.464]  Is it going to get worse?
[00:20:10.504 --> 00:20:11.345]  Is it going to get better?
[00:20:11.405 --> 00:20:12.486]  Are there any solutions?
[00:20:13.526 --> 00:20:19.611]  All these stories I see in the Texas press about Satanism on the border, kidnapping, killing people in rituals.
[00:20:21.826 --> 00:20:26.408]  Phase 1 of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[00:20:26.748 --> 00:20:33.931]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[00:20:34.171 --> 00:20:35.552]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:20:35.792 --> 00:20:39.693]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:20:39.953 --> 00:20:43.535]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:20:43.775 --> 00:20:47.876]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:20:48.257 --> 00:20:51.698]  Phase 1 is a One World Currency, which we are currently being prepared
[00:20:51.698 --> 00:20:51.898]  We're good.
[00:21:21.894 --> 00:21:28.279]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:21:28.639 --> 00:21:30.641]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:31.302 --> 00:21:32.322]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:32.843 --> 00:21:33.383]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:33.643 --> 00:21:34.544]  This is his ammo.
[00:21:34.564 --> 00:21:35.925]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:36.025 --> 00:21:37.707]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:38.007 --> 00:21:44.752]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:45.153 --> 00:21:45.593]  Some U.S.
[00:21:45.653 --> 00:21:51.318]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:55.460]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.621]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:22:21.852 --> 00:22:25.454]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[00:22:25.774 --> 00:22:29.296]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[00:22:29.596 --> 00:22:38.381]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists with decades of financial experience who are ready to provide you with state-of-the-art, up-to-date financial services.

[00:23:22.236 --> 00:23:24.197]  Is your credit card debt out of control?
[00:23:24.377 --> 00:23:26.879]  Are you in over your head dealing with monthly payments?
[00:23:27.159 --> 00:23:30.721]  There's a powerful secret that credit card companies don't want you to know.
[00:23:31.001 --> 00:23:37.925]  If you have credit card debt, you have the power to settle that debt for a fraction of what you owe, cutting your payments by up to half or more.
[00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:41.566]  That's bad news for credit card companies, but it's great news for you.
[00:23:41.807 --> 00:23:48.850]  And we'd like to offer you free information that will show you how to settle your credit card debt and lower your payments by up to half or more.
[00:23:49.271 --> 00:23:49.991]  It's yours free.
[00:23:50.011 --> 00:23:50.312]  We're good.
[00:24:00.657 --> 00:24:01.197]  We are back live.
[00:24:01.257 --> 00:24:02.018]  He is a professor.
[00:24:27.655 --> 00:24:34.777]  At the College of William and Mary, one of the leading experts on what's happening in Latin America and Mexico right now.
[00:24:34.817 --> 00:24:40.038]  His new book is on its way to being a bestseller, Mexico's Struggle with Drugs and Thugs.
[00:24:40.659 --> 00:24:45.380]  Just Google that and pull it up or you can find it in bookstores everywhere.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:49.261]  We appreciate the professor joining us today.
[00:24:52.315 --> 00:24:54.775]  Professor, you already said it's getting worse there.
[00:24:54.815 --> 00:24:57.396]  They're on track to have even more murders than last year.
[00:24:57.416 --> 00:25:00.036]  We're now seeing murders spill over to the U.S.
[00:25:00.476 --> 00:25:07.878]  I know in California and Arizona, New Mexico, a lot of city officials, police chiefs, mayors, fire chiefs live on the U.S.
[00:25:07.918 --> 00:25:08.938]  side now.
[00:25:09.178 --> 00:25:13.479]  Places that were, you know, hopping tourist traps are now dead.
[00:25:14.919 --> 00:25:16.979]  If it's getting worse, how much worse will it get?
[00:25:17.019 --> 00:25:21.580]  I mean, are you projecting it just gets worse and worse each year, out until some point, or what's happening?
[00:25:23.689 --> 00:25:38.278]  Yeah, it's going to continue to deteriorate as long as we are buying 80-85% of the drugs that are produced in or passed through Mexico.
[00:25:38.298 --> 00:25:53.247]  And while it's a political third rail for politicians, I think we're going to have to move toward decriminalizing the possession and the sale of small quantities of
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.842]  At least marijuana to begin with.
[00:25:56.342 --> 00:25:59.364]  And that'll drive down the price, and it'll, I mean, look what happened.
[00:25:59.944 --> 00:26:10.652]  I'm glad you said this, because I had a state senator on as a big Republican, and he was even having to admit that Mexico's having to look at this, because if there weren't fantastic profits, you wouldn't have all of this going on.
[00:26:11.453 --> 00:26:19.058]  Sure, and prohibition is just an example of where we try to outlaw something
[00:26:20.267 --> 00:26:30.274]  And the result was that the crime spiraled, illegal activity mushroomed, and the consumption of alcohol rose.
[00:26:30.334 --> 00:26:31.595]  Troubled, yeah.
[00:26:31.975 --> 00:26:38.700]  And so I'm afraid, because there's no good answer.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:49.307]  But we have to at least think about the unthinkable, and I hope that more politicians will step forward and at least raise the issue for debate.
[00:26:49.963 --> 00:26:59.107]  Well, I bought a little piece of property in the Austin Hill Country, like four acres, and we found on that the laudanum bottles from, you know, 80, 90 years ago.
[00:26:59.127 --> 00:27:08.511]  I mean, every drug store had cocaine, opium, everything, you know, any old farmhouse you find out, you know, in the bushes, these bottles, or you dig and you find them.
[00:27:08.531 --> 00:27:10.392]  A lot of Americans use it, but I've seen the numbers.
[00:27:10.432 --> 00:27:14.274]  It was around a third of the people that are on opiates, you know, then.
[00:27:15.114 --> 00:27:20.777]  It was a third of the amount of people that we have now when these opiates are highly controlled.
[00:27:21.137 --> 00:27:21.337]  Yeah.
[00:27:21.517 --> 00:27:26.200]  Well, Coca-Cola originally had Coca in it.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.220]  That's right.
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.242]  And it was eventually taken out because of political issues.
[00:27:31.402 --> 00:27:34.664]  But yes, it was widespread around the turn of the century.
[00:27:35.704 --> 00:27:39.866]  And that was all lumped in with the prohibition movement.
[00:27:41.385 --> 00:27:47.530]  Okay, so by getting worse, what is Mexico going to look like in 6 months, 12 months, a year and a half?
[00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:51.274]  We're going to see it in terms of more pressure at the border.
[00:27:52.515 --> 00:27:58.960]  And I think we need to move ahead and get that fence completed.
[00:28:00.141 --> 00:28:09.129]  That's no panacea because probably, Alex, 40% of the illegal immigrants who come into the United States come in legally.
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:17.064]  As students or as business people or as tourists, simply overstay their visas.
[00:28:18.045 --> 00:28:25.029]  And I think if you or I didn't pay our visa card in a month or two, Visa would find us.
[00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:29.451]  But the Department of Homeland Security has no records.
[00:28:30.132 --> 00:28:37.016]  And so let's hope that Governor Napolitano will try to close that loophole.
[00:28:38.002 --> 00:28:55.634]  Because we are an open society, we want to stay that way, but it is intolerable that a third to 40% of legal visitors can overstay their term and become illegal aliens.
[00:28:56.975 --> 00:29:06.922]  I'm not politically correct, I don't use the term undocumented immigrant, that to me is like saying that a
[00:29:07.569 --> 00:29:11.592]  A bank robber is an unauthorized withdrawal specialist.
[00:29:13.774 --> 00:29:14.254]  You're funny.
[00:29:14.954 --> 00:29:16.676]  Oh, I'll tell you, there's so much to talk about.
[00:29:17.696 --> 00:29:18.837]  We've got one minute before we break.
[00:29:18.857 --> 00:29:20.939]  We're coming back in a long segment with you, final segment.
[00:29:21.179 --> 00:29:22.980]  What are some of the... I mean, I've asked my questions, sir.
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.021]  You're the expert on this.
[00:29:25.042 --> 00:29:28.064]  What are some of the key points that are coming up in the next segment?
[00:29:31.266 --> 00:29:35.289]  The government, our government, cannot patronize the Mexicans.
[00:29:36.005 --> 00:29:39.188]  Mexico is an incredibly wealthy country.
[00:29:40.469 --> 00:29:54.521]  Oil, gas, gold, silver, beaches, historical artifacts, and we have got to encourage the Mexicans to mobilize their resources and provide a better life for their people.
[00:29:55.899 --> 00:30:07.065]  Let's talk about your ideas from studying the culture and writing a weekly publication on the subject of how they can do that because the corrupt want to keep everything to themselves and so the people really never get a chance to get out of poverty.
[00:30:07.405 --> 00:30:10.907]  How do we change the kleptocracy that is Mexico?
[00:30:12.007 --> 00:30:15.009]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:15.929 --> 00:30:18.750]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:23.613 --> 00:30:25.554]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[00:30:26.178 --> 00:30:28.665]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[00:30:29.246 --> 00:30:33.418]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[00:30:34.167 --> 00:30:35.929]  You know that you need to prepare.
[00:30:36.289 --> 00:30:39.312]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[00:30:39.692 --> 00:30:42.695]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[00:30:42.995 --> 00:30:54.385]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds and survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.

[00:31:00.691 --> 00:31:01.171]  I think so.
[00:31:21.667 --> 00:31:23.709]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:31:23.829 --> 00:31:26.231]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:28.352]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:31:28.492 --> 00:31:30.034]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:31:30.054 --> 00:31:31.675]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[00:31:31.795 --> 00:31:34.617]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:31:34.657 --> 00:31:38.300]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:31:47.936 --> 00:31:52.888]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:55.213]  An inside job!
[00:31:56.619 --> 00:31:57.699]  How dare you!
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:04.122]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:32:04.262 --> 00:32:06.923]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:32:07.023 --> 00:32:13.185]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:33:14.644 --> 00:33:15.224]  We are back live.
[00:33:15.244 --> 00:33:17.545]  We have Professor George Grayson, author of the new book,
[00:33:43.228 --> 00:33:45.130]  Mexico's struggle with drugs and thugs.
[00:33:45.291 --> 00:33:47.874]  Excellent book, folks, if you want to understand what's happening down in Mexico.
[00:33:48.955 --> 00:33:54.943]  We've got to decriminalize drugs now, ladies and gentlemen, because it creates a giant criminal society.
[00:33:55.003 --> 00:34:00.530]  Crime went up several hundred percentage points across the United States during the nine years of prohibition.
[00:34:01.747 --> 00:34:02.807]  Alcoholism spiked.
[00:34:02.887 --> 00:34:04.308]  Poisoning from alcohol spiked.
[00:34:04.488 --> 00:34:06.829]  That's why heroin and cocaine is filled with all these other poisons.
[00:34:07.569 --> 00:34:07.949]  All of it.
[00:34:08.269 --> 00:34:16.832]  And then there's all this money involved in it so it's seen as stylish and cool and cutting edge and fancy cars and mansions so people get into it.
[00:34:17.352 --> 00:34:19.333]  But if we decriminalize
[00:34:20.376 --> 00:34:24.039]  The only problem is, the major banks that have been laundering this money forever are going to collapse.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:42.676]  Professor, you know, growing up in Texas, I've read all the Texas Monthly and Dallas Morning News articles about women being kidnapped from El Paso and Laredo, other places, being taken over, being killed, being raped, all the women they've dug up dead in the desert, you know, hundreds and hundreds, just in one case in El Paso.
[00:34:44.237 --> 00:34:46.079]  What's your intel on that?
[00:34:46.299 --> 00:34:47.160]  What's happening there?
[00:34:50.870 --> 00:35:00.297]  They're targeting women in Juarez, and of course it's easy to pass from Juarez into El Paso to pick up your victims.
[00:35:01.278 --> 00:35:10.844]  The Mexican authorities claim to be pursuing all leads, but they've been monumentally unsuccessful in finding the culprits.
[00:35:11.785 --> 00:35:16.769]  And it doesn't appear to be linked to the narco violence, but
[00:35:17.771 --> 00:35:23.272]  A separate group of ghoulish killers, but I frankly don't know.
[00:35:25.433 --> 00:35:36.876]  Changing subjects briefly, we were talking about what Mexico can do, and the Barack Obama administration has no silver bullets.
[00:35:36.956 --> 00:35:47.479]  I hope they don't exacerbate the situation by trying to let more illegal workers into the United States, or legalizing those who are here.
[00:35:48.614 --> 00:36:00.280]  However, to take one example, the teachers in Mexico belong to one of the most venal and corrupt and wealthy unions in the world.
[00:36:01.101 --> 00:36:06.784]  And the way you get your teaching job is by playing nice with the union.
[00:36:07.764 --> 00:36:14.988]  And this means that the middle class families, they will literally sell a kidney.
[00:36:15.581 --> 00:36:18.123]  In order to get their kids into private schools.
[00:36:19.123 --> 00:36:27.128]  A country can't progress if it doesn't have first-rate health care and good education, and Mexico has neither.
[00:36:28.189 --> 00:36:45.099]  But the Calderon government is really, for political reasons, working with the head of the Teachers Union, La Maestra as she's called, when they should be doing trust-busting, not just of the big corporations in Mexico,
[00:36:45.754 --> 00:37:02.406]  But of powerful labor unions that have colonized public education, they've colonized the petroleum sector, they've colonized the electricity industry, and that's something the Mexicans on their own can do.
[00:37:03.126 --> 00:37:06.749]  The second thing is they don't pay taxes in Mexico.
[00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:12.413]  Mexico collects, as a percentage of gross domestic product, about 11.8% of its GDP.
[00:37:15.973 --> 00:37:19.916]  That's on a par with Haiti, an absolutely failed state.
[00:37:20.657 --> 00:37:24.279]  It's a third of what we collect, and we collect too much.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.183]  But they've got to start raising revenues.
[00:37:29.303 --> 00:37:31.285]  Now that's the official taxes, though.
[00:37:31.305 --> 00:37:36.549]  People pay all this mordido to police, corrupt officials, the corrupt unions, the thugs.
[00:37:36.569 --> 00:37:40.472]  Do you have any idea of what the real number of taxes through payoffs are?
[00:37:42.475 --> 00:37:48.196]  Yeah, I think the official taxes are just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:37:48.977 --> 00:38:02.100]  Because, for example, if you want a career job, a tenured job in the public oil monopoly, you would pay about $40,000 for a professional position there.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.381]  And that would ensure you a good income for the rest of your life.
[00:38:07.054 --> 00:38:08.354]  And a princely retirement.
[00:38:08.775 --> 00:38:09.755]  Well, let me tell you a story.
[00:38:09.775 --> 00:38:15.136]  I, uh, about three years ago, took a five-day vacation with my family.
[00:38:16.297 --> 00:38:19.157]  I wanted to go, you know, show my wife the pyramids down there.
[00:38:19.197 --> 00:38:35.362]  We went down to Costa Maya, went to some of the pyramids, and they would stop the big tour bus with, uh, you know, Humvees and Jeeps with machine guns in the back, heavy machine guns, and the bus driver would get out and go pay them cash just to drive the, you know, 30 miles to the pyramid.
[00:38:36.122 --> 00:38:40.705]  And I hadn't seen that previously when I was in high school and college and, you know, going with my parents down there.
[00:38:41.405 --> 00:38:44.106]  So, I mean, we talk about corruption.
[00:38:44.146 --> 00:38:45.027]  It's right up at the top.
[00:38:45.287 --> 00:38:50.570]  We always hear about top government officials being caught on the payroll of different mafias, different cartels.
[00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:54.352]  So, I mean, we talk about, you know, the government fighting cartels.
[00:38:54.412 --> 00:39:01.576]  Isn't this really the government that controls the major cartels battling it out with non-licensed
[00:39:02.176 --> 00:39:08.019]  You know, I think that Felipe Calderon, whom I've known for some years, is a decent, respectable, well-intentioned person who is pure as Caesar's wife.
[00:39:29.195 --> 00:39:36.778]  But there are certainly some bad actors around him, and we talked about the elections coming up on July 5.
[00:39:37.238 --> 00:39:50.302]  It looks like the old PRI, the party that ran Mexico from 1929 until 2000, is going to return to power, first in taking over the Congress and then in all likelihood
[00:39:56.947 --> 00:39:59.189]  Winning back the presidency in 2012.
[00:40:00.609 --> 00:40:07.594]  And the PRI is the party that's most closely tied to the criminal organizations.
[00:40:07.994 --> 00:40:11.396]  So is this what you're getting at?
[00:40:11.536 --> 00:40:16.159]  The PRI is orchestrating all of this to make it collapse so they get back into power?
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:26.165]  I don't know whether it's that Machiavellian, but the PRI was in power so long that many of their leaders developed
[00:40:26.775 --> 00:40:32.116]  I'm an optimist by nature when I get an email from an ex-secretary of finance from Nigeria
[00:40:54.557 --> 00:41:00.398]  Telling me that if I will send him a couple hundred dollars, he will send me ten million dollars.
[00:41:00.418 --> 00:41:02.379]  I always write him a check.
[00:41:02.479 --> 00:41:04.879]  I feel like he's just down on his luck.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:09.561]  It's hard to be optimistic when you look at Mexico.
[00:41:10.081 --> 00:41:12.221]  So in the long run, what do you see happening in Mexico?
[00:41:14.362 --> 00:41:18.983]  That conditions continue to deteriorate.
[00:41:19.823 --> 00:41:22.744]  Unemployment grows and there is
[00:41:24.514 --> 00:41:28.216]  A massive crush to leave the country.
[00:41:28.816 --> 00:41:46.024]  Some will go to Europe, some to Canada, some to Australia, but the overwhelming majority will try to get into the United States, and that's going to mean that we don't just put walls at the border, but we're going to have to have National Guard, if not regular troops there.
[00:41:46.465 --> 00:41:51.287]  Mexico poses a much greater threat to us than, say, Pakistan or Afghanistan.
[00:41:51.795 --> 00:42:02.764]  Clearly past administrations, since Bill Clinton, George Bush, and now Obama, admittedly are allowing Mexico to use the United States as a steam valve.
[00:42:04.886 --> 00:42:13.153]  Way over 30 million illegal aliens that come back and forth, and upwards of 40% I've seen in the news of the money they send back ends up being paid in secret taxes.
[00:42:13.634 --> 00:42:15.075]  So that's the U.S.
[00:42:15.135 --> 00:42:16.776]  funding this corruption as well.
[00:42:17.817 --> 00:42:36.928]  And it looks like the establishment is going to attempt, with this contiguous Security Prosperity Partnership border, from what I've seen in the SPP, North American Union integration documents, that Judicial Watch sued and got about two years ago, what I see happening is that, and they're talking about it, is somehow the U.S.
[00:42:37.028 --> 00:42:40.129]  invading, backing up the Mexican military.
[00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:45.993]  They're somehow then legalizing tens of millions more workers.
[00:42:46.733 --> 00:42:48.594]  I mean, I don't see that working.
[00:42:48.774 --> 00:42:51.216]  I mean, I think we need to shut that border down right now.
[00:42:52.937 --> 00:42:54.358]  And pushback is coming.
[00:42:55.238 --> 00:42:59.400]  As we know, the politicians in Washington live in their own world.
[00:43:00.641 --> 00:43:08.426]  But where you find resistance to the porosity of the border is in state legislatures.
[00:43:09.266 --> 00:43:12.408]  And you see it in Texas, you see it in Arizona.
[00:43:14.013 --> 00:43:29.786]  You see it in Arkansas, you see it in Tennessee, you see it all throughout the South and the Southwest, where hundreds of bills are being introduced to curtail the benefits given to illegal immigrants.
[00:43:30.546 --> 00:43:39.874]  And as our unemployment rate approaches 10% in this country, I think that some of the candy-ass liberals in
[00:43:40.419 --> 00:43:51.084]  Washington are even going to, excuse my language, are even going to rethink their positions because they are out of touch with their constituents.
[00:43:51.844 --> 00:43:54.665]  And Alex, I have to tell you, I'm a yellow dog Democrat.
[00:43:54.945 --> 00:44:08.791]  I'm a Roosevelt Truman Democrat, but I can't believe that we are shortchanging legal residents of the United States who have serious problems, who've lost their jobs,
[00:44:09.264 --> 00:44:09.824]  We're good.
[00:44:25.356 --> 00:44:27.838]  Well, Professor Grayson, you're absolutely right.
[00:44:27.858 --> 00:44:29.199]  I mean, this is just reality.
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:51.139]  I've studied many nations of the planet, and you know, you study this, you know, professionally, but I can't think of many other nations, except for maybe some Central African or West African, Eastern African nations that are as bad as Mexico, and on the verge of just disintegration, as Mexico is.
[00:44:51.179 --> 00:44:51.980]  I mean, it's one of the
[00:44:54.429 --> 00:44:58.617]  Well, it's so wealthy, triple the natural resources we have, but also so corrupt.
[00:44:58.657 --> 00:45:03.105]  And I can't think of having a more vile, nasty neighbor.
[00:45:04.249 --> 00:45:05.550]  I mean, could the U.S.
[00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:27.243]  border a more corrupt, out-of-control, dangerous nation with 100 million people set to, what, double in the next 30 years to 200 million people who get free health care, anchor babies, everything's going bankrupt here, tent cities sprouting up from Michigan to California to Florida, and the government is just going forward with more benefits?
[00:45:27.283 --> 00:45:31.005]  I mean, what is going to happen both on our side and in Mexico?
[00:45:32.734 --> 00:45:39.798]  The population's going to probably stabilize in Mexico at about 115, 118 million.
[00:45:40.598 --> 00:45:45.400]  Because Mexico, like ours, is an aging society.
[00:45:46.641 --> 00:45:51.663]  On a person-to-person basis, there are no nicer people in the world.
[00:45:51.723 --> 00:45:52.324]  No, I know that.
[00:45:52.344 --> 00:45:57.366]  I agree, but the system is so... I mean, I've been shut down by Mexican cops, so... Go ahead.
[00:45:57.786 --> 00:45:59.027]  Yeah, well, I agree.
[00:45:59.427 --> 00:46:01.048]  If my car...
[00:46:01.721 --> 00:46:03.942]  We're to break down an isolated area.
[00:46:03.962 --> 00:46:14.645]  The last vehicle I would want to approach me would be a police car, because you know you're going to get ripped off six ways to sundown.
[00:46:15.865 --> 00:46:18.786]  But there's a growing Mexican middle class.
[00:46:19.126 --> 00:46:24.367]  A lot of the criticism that we make of the Mexican government is made in Mexico.
[00:46:24.387 --> 00:46:30.969]  But I fear that with the pre likely to come back to power,
[00:46:31.832 --> 00:46:51.208]  That conditions are going to deteriorate and there's going to be more collusion between the organized crime that's in the private sector and the organized crime that's in the public sector in the form of politicians.
[00:46:51.624 --> 00:46:57.086]  Okay, quantify Mexico getting worse for the foreseeable future.
[00:46:57.347 --> 00:46:59.448]  Many experts are saying it's on the verge of collapse.
[00:46:59.468 --> 00:47:02.029]  You're saying, well no, more of a slow rotting.
[00:47:02.369 --> 00:47:04.130]  What is it going to rot into?
[00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:07.271]  There's going to be a growing unemployment.
[00:47:08.772 --> 00:47:13.034]  More than a million newcomers enter the labor market each year.
[00:47:13.574 --> 00:47:15.034]  They can't find jobs.
[00:47:15.715 --> 00:47:20.357]  And moreover, Mexico's lost hundreds of thousands of jobs because of the
[00:47:21.087 --> 00:47:23.869]  economic crisis generated in the United States.
[00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:31.693]  The educational system is one of the worst in the relatively developed world.
[00:47:32.714 --> 00:47:37.397]  The health care system is spotty, to say the least.
[00:47:38.277 --> 00:47:49.044]  And there is a just a pervasive pessimism, which I've never encountered before, that is engulfing
[00:47:49.671 --> 00:47:49.751]  I've
[00:48:11.132 --> 00:48:14.893]  And one of the wonderful things about Mexico is that they are so family-oriented.
[00:48:14.953 --> 00:48:15.834]  Oh yeah, great people.
[00:48:15.934 --> 00:48:30.318]  I mean, that's the paradox here, or the oxymoron, is they're great, hard-working, smart, great ingenuity, just some of the best artwork, just amazing people, but then the government's pure scum and filth.
[00:48:30.478 --> 00:48:39.201]  I mean, I just... And that's what we're finding now in places like
[00:48:40.342 --> 00:48:55.094]  Michoacán, which is on the Pacific Coast, has the country's largest port, is that in rural areas, the drug cartels are actually vetting the candidates for public office.
[00:48:55.874 --> 00:49:03.541]  And the cartels aren't so much concerned about Mexican deputies or senators who will serve in Mexico City.
[00:49:04.681 --> 00:49:07.704]  Their focus is on mayors.
[00:49:08.882 --> 00:49:10.523]  And municipal officers.
[00:49:10.543 --> 00:49:11.123]  That's smart!
[00:49:11.143 --> 00:49:13.384]  They know the real power is in the local area.
[00:49:13.684 --> 00:49:16.886]  I've also read and seen reports all over where they're stealing people's land.
[00:49:17.186 --> 00:49:19.427]  That they're pushing some of the small middle class off too.
[00:49:21.288 --> 00:49:22.969]  They may be doing some of that.
[00:49:23.909 --> 00:49:35.894]  But Mexico, several drug dealers have just been found to be beneficiaries of some farm subsidy programs that the Mexican government operates.
[00:49:37.785 --> 00:49:41.287]  Digressing the acid baths, I've read some about that.
[00:49:42.267 --> 00:49:44.809]  They're torturing people in acid or getting rid of the bodies in acid?
[00:49:46.329 --> 00:49:48.070]  Oh, they have various ways.
[00:49:49.971 --> 00:50:03.358]  For example, in Michoacan about a year and a half ago, they took five fellows who apparently had been flirting with a cartel member's girlfriend.
[00:50:04.384 --> 00:50:22.595]  And while they were alive, they sawed their heads off and then the next night they went to the place where the girlfriend worked and tossed the heads onto the dance floor just to sort of send a message that you don't mess with us.
[00:50:24.396 --> 00:50:29.239]  And the beheadings are becoming legion.
[00:50:30.099 --> 00:50:32.621]  You can't say in a joking fashion
[00:50:33.379 --> 00:50:38.321]  Well, let's not lose our head over this, because it may have resonance in Mexico.
[00:50:39.121 --> 00:50:43.283]  And they're finding absolutely despicable ways to torture people.
[00:50:44.063 --> 00:50:50.626]  And they're going after some of these military officers who've taken up security functions in the cities.
[00:50:50.646 --> 00:50:55.568]  A general was hired about a week ago in Cancun.
[00:50:56.708 --> 00:50:59.109]  They broke all of his... broke his arms and legs.
[00:50:59.856 --> 00:51:07.618]  before pumping a bunch of bullets into his head just to say that no one is exempt from our violence.
[00:51:07.658 --> 00:51:09.319]  I'll tell you what, Professor, we're gonna break.
[00:51:09.339 --> 00:51:11.340]  Can we do five more minutes with you to the end of the hour?
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.680]  Sure, I'll be fine.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:20.182]  I want to come back and talk more about, you know, their machine gunning, the police and military, and in summation, what the breakdown will finally come to.

[00:52:21.977 --> 00:52:28.360]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.701]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:31.362 --> 00:52:32.402]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:32.923 --> 00:52:33.423]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:33.723 --> 00:52:34.623]  This is his MO.
[00:52:34.663 --> 00:52:36.064]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:36.104 --> 00:52:37.765]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:38.065 --> 00:52:44.829]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:45.229 --> 00:52:45.669]  Some U.S.
[00:52:45.709 --> 00:52:51.372]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:52.052 --> 00:52:55.494]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:55.514 --> 00:52:57.696]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:21.798 --> 00:53:23.219]  So you want to stop smoking.
[00:53:23.279 --> 00:53:24.379]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:27.301]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[00:53:27.441 --> 00:53:31.263]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[00:53:31.423 --> 00:53:34.965]  And if, and only if, you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it.
[00:53:35.185 --> 00:53:37.146]  Most likely, if you try this, you'd be arrested.
[00:53:37.186 --> 00:53:41.129]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the Smokefree Free Trial Offer is.
[00:53:41.509 --> 00:53:44.290]  Smokefree is a complete, all-natural stop smoking system.

[00:54:19.688 --> 00:54:26.495]  Alright, final segment with our guest.
[00:54:26.535 --> 00:54:29.939]  This book is Mexico's Struggle with Drugs and Thugs.
[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:33.383]  Professor George Grayson of William & Mary.
[00:54:36.397 --> 00:54:40.021]  Professor, you know, you go through all these killings, the torture, the murder.
[00:54:40.661 --> 00:54:43.884]  Now Phoenix is the kidnapping capital of the United States.
[00:54:45.799 --> 00:54:56.667]  From what you say, it's just going to get worse and worse and worse and we have to fight with the federal government not to just totally, I guess, let all this murder and killing and car bombings in Dallas and rocket attacks on the Texas border.
[00:54:56.707 --> 00:55:11.158]  I guess it's just... and I've interviewed sheriffs where the Mexican troops come across the border when they get some of the drugs in a shipment and put guns to the sheriff's heads and, you know, then I have state reps on and they go, well, I don't know if that's true when it's in the newspapers on the border.
[00:55:12.799 --> 00:55:14.240]  I mean, you say it's just going to get worse.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.581]  I mean, until what?
[00:55:15.681 --> 00:55:17.062]  I mean, what's going to happen?
[00:55:19.343 --> 00:55:26.908]  I really think that decriminalization has to be the longer term answer.
[00:55:27.909 --> 00:55:31.351]  And earlier we talked about the parallels with prohibition.
[00:55:31.371 --> 00:55:40.958]  And of course, ending prohibition wasn't a silver bullet, but it certainly reduced dramatically
[00:55:41.961 --> 00:55:46.905]  The Al Capone type gun battles that went on over turf.
[00:55:48.105 --> 00:55:51.828]  And I think we're going to have to open our eyes to that.
[00:55:52.729 --> 00:56:10.961]  But at the same time, we're going to continue to see problems springing from Mexico in terms of the lack of opportunities there, driving unemployed Mexicans into the United States, legally if they can, but most likely illegally.
[00:56:11.852 --> 00:56:21.560]  And I think we must stop patronizing Mexico, stop patting them on the head, and say our little brown friends, what can we do to help you?
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:35.972]  And emphasize that they do have incredible resources, which if they mobilized, they could greatly improve the conditions for their people.
[00:56:36.472 --> 00:56:39.295]  But the culture of corruption, how do they get around that?
[00:56:40.074 --> 00:57:05.100]  Well, I've always said that if Mexico could lease its territory to, say, Taiwan or Singapore for 20 years, we'd be talking about the Colossus of the South, and we'd all be buying up pole-vaulting equipment to jump the wall to get into Mexico because of the incredible resources they have.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:09.681]  But we play into the victimization line.
[00:57:10.627 --> 00:57:13.828]  And I try to read the New York Times every morning.
[00:57:14.608 --> 00:57:26.212]  Sometimes I lose my breakfast because it still believes we should be legalizing illegals amid the high unemployment in the in the United States.
[00:57:26.753 --> 00:57:29.374]  But I think it is going to depend on U.S.
[00:57:29.474 --> 00:57:39.257]  policymakers talking turkey with their Mexican counterparts and saying we will cooperate as we're doing with the Merida
[00:57:39.756 --> 00:58:09.006]  initiative but uh... the uh... onus is really on you to improve your public school system to collect more in taxes to uh... throw in jail uh... those cops who were on the take and uh... then they attack the jail uh... you know and and and regretfully uh... often the uh... of the inmates who run the prisons and they've got the same problems with gangs inside uh...
[00:58:09.568 --> 00:58:10.729]  Inside the prisons.
[00:58:11.309 --> 00:58:17.474]  One way you get around that is you lease the jails out to private industries.
[00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:22.476]  And you pay professionals to run your jails.
[00:58:22.796 --> 00:58:35.181]  Well, Professor, in closing, I want to thank you for joining us, but I get from everything you've said that it doesn't look like those proper things will be done, and so Mexico, I guess, is just going to turn into the literal pit of hell?
[00:58:36.822 --> 00:58:40.684]  Well, conditions are certainly not going to get better any time soon.
[00:58:41.224 --> 00:58:45.146]  All right, the book is Mexico's Struggle with Drugs and Thugs, in bookstores everywhere.
[00:58:45.786 --> 00:58:47.527]  Any websites you'd like to fire out, Professor?
[00:58:48.604 --> 00:58:57.673]  Well, the book is published by the Foreign Policy Association, and so if anybody wants to go to the Foreign Policy Association, that's in New York.
[00:58:57.693 --> 00:58:58.935]  All right, thank you, sir.
[00:58:58.955 --> 00:58:59.595]  We're out of time.
[00:58:59.675 --> 00:59:00.876]  Thank you so much for the time.
[00:59:03.419 --> 00:59:05.521]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:59:06.022 --> 00:59:09.185]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:11.613 --> 00:59:13.195]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:59:13.295 --> 00:59:17.921]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:59:18.042 --> 00:59:20.805]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:21.005 --> 00:59:23.889]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:28.776]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:29.096 --> 00:59:29.657]  We're good to go.
[00:59:48.775 --> 00:59:54.859]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:58.782]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:58.802 --> 01:00:00.303]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:00:00.343 --> 01:00:00.764]  Take action today.
[01:00:00.784 --> 01:00:02.765]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:00:14.338 --> 01:00:16.264]  Waging War on Corruption!
[01:00:16.745 --> 01:00:19.533]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network!
[01:00:27.495 --> 01:00:32.138]  Just a program note, Jason Mermis will start his new weeknight three-hour show.
[01:00:32.198 --> 01:00:34.039]  It will be on the Genesis Star Guide.
[01:00:34.079 --> 01:00:39.542]  We need to get the folks at GCNLive.com to post the satellite coordinates for the new satellite.
[01:00:39.562 --> 01:00:49.307]  I'm going to have a satellite on ABC Star Guide 24 hours a day, 21 hours a day of this show when it's live and then retransmitted for stations and three hours a night with Jason Mermis.
[01:00:50.888 --> 01:00:54.175]  That will be 9 to midnight this evening.
[01:00:54.877 --> 01:00:56.280]  Central Standard Time.
[01:00:56.721 --> 01:00:59.908]  Burmess will be in studio with us with a stack of news in 30 minutes.
[01:01:01.072 --> 01:01:09.258]  Gordon Brown admitting there's a World Government World Banking System, but they'll have a new World Government Banking System to save you from it, and he's on his way to the United States to pitch this to the public.
[01:01:10.019 --> 01:01:14.503]  So we will continue to break that down and cover it today.
[01:01:15.403 --> 01:01:18.446]  Right now, you've been holding a while, let's take your phone calls.
[01:01:18.866 --> 01:01:22.429]  Let's talk to Don in Alabama, in Bama.
[01:01:22.729 --> 01:01:23.650]  You're on the air, Don.
[01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:25.251]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:01:25.491 --> 01:01:25.871]  Good, sir.
[01:01:26.632 --> 01:01:30.295]  I would like to talk about people's political affiliations today.
[01:01:31.051 --> 01:01:40.898]  Uh, you know, I've spoken up about Bush and his policies previously and over the years, you know, we've all gotten used to it, but lately I've gotten a lot of feedback from people.
[01:01:40.978 --> 01:01:48.003]  It seems like Republicans now are seeing that they have a chance to, uh, throw rocks at a democratic president.
[01:01:48.444 --> 01:01:52.647]  But my point to them is that it isn't about political affiliation.
[01:01:53.267 --> 01:01:54.768]  It's something that is universal.
[01:01:54.808 --> 01:01:56.269]  It isn't that I'm a Democrat.
[01:01:56.970 --> 01:01:57.010]  Uh,
[01:01:57.921 --> 01:02:00.683]  I'm just trying to point out facts of things that are going on.
[01:02:00.843 --> 01:02:05.506]  It's about policies and what the policies are of the gang of crooks in Washington.
[01:02:05.966 --> 01:02:09.569]  It has no regard to whether you're a Democrat or a Republican.
[01:02:10.029 --> 01:02:16.153]  You know, I sat there and I told them early on, as soon as I saw Brzezinski's name, I knew Obama would win the election.
[01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:17.594]  It was just a hands-down thing.
[01:02:17.654 --> 01:02:19.675]  People shake their head at me and, oh, you're an idiot.
[01:02:20.075 --> 01:02:21.456]  You know, but it came true.
[01:02:21.636 --> 01:02:22.337]  Of course it was.
[01:02:22.497 --> 01:02:23.598]  I've seen the name before.
[01:02:23.618 --> 01:02:24.598]  I know what's going to happen.
[01:02:27.028 --> 01:02:34.420]  But I try to get people to, if you want to, sit there and talk about what's going on, stand with me.
[01:02:34.721 --> 01:02:38.908]  Don't try to stand across from me like you're opposing me as a Republican.
[01:02:39.863 --> 01:02:46.509]  No, no, it's mindless party partisanship where the Republicans will attack Obama now for carrying out the same policies of Bush.
[01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:49.692]  The Democrats will support Obama when he's carrying out the same policies of Bush.
[01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:58.599]  It is utter madness and childlike simplicity for people not to be able to see through the fact that both parties are bought and paid for by the same interest!
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:04.724]  Well, you know, I can go back and point to them and say, well, you're part of the Democratic-Republican Party.
[01:03:05.051 --> 01:03:08.172]  Because that's where it all started, and they split apart and went their own way.
[01:03:08.192 --> 01:03:09.693]  The Republicans, the Republicans, yeah.
[01:03:10.673 --> 01:03:13.274]  It's all the same thing from way back in the 1800s.
[01:03:13.334 --> 01:03:15.055]  They just split and went their different way.
[01:03:15.095 --> 01:03:16.395]  They're both paid-off groups.
[01:03:16.995 --> 01:03:29.180]  But I just like to encourage Republicans who want to call themselves that and Democrats who want to call themselves that to stand together and not try to belittle each other and belittle each other's efforts.
[01:03:29.531 --> 01:03:30.111]  Oh, I agree.
[01:03:30.212 --> 01:03:31.292]  I appreciate your call, Don.
[01:03:31.332 --> 01:03:54.147]  There was this big Republican CPAC or whatever meeting Friday, Saturday, and Ron Paul spoke at it and was anti-war and got cheered, was anti-New World Order and got cheered, but then Limbaugh and all the rest of them went up there and acted like this whole corrupt system was just set up overnight by Obama and acted like they're the good conservatives and they had a straw poll and Mitt Romney's their man.
[01:03:54.668 --> 01:03:57.810]  That guy's about as conservative as Mao Zedong.
[01:03:59.116 --> 01:03:59.476]  Again.
[01:04:00.896 --> 01:04:07.317]  Then in four to eight years they'll put a Republican in, suddenly Republicans will love everything Obama was doing because a Republican will be doing it.
[01:04:07.397 --> 01:04:09.018]  It is a mindless joke.
[01:04:09.658 --> 01:04:11.518]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tee in Canada.
[01:04:11.598 --> 01:04:12.358]  Tee, go ahead.
[01:04:14.279 --> 01:04:14.619]  Hello.
[01:04:15.099 --> 01:04:15.639]  Hello, Tee.
[01:04:16.299 --> 01:04:17.039]  Yes, how are you?
[01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:21.160]  Actually, my name is Dahogged, but your guy couldn't pronounce it, but Tee's good.
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:27.201]  I wanted to know if you've seen this film by John Harris on YouTube called It's an Illusion.
[01:04:28.092 --> 01:04:29.373]  I think it's very important.
[01:04:29.393 --> 01:04:30.534]  I don't think so.
[01:04:31.294 --> 01:04:35.697]  Well, you know, you should get your guys on YouTube to search this John Harris.
[01:04:35.757 --> 01:04:36.458]  It's an illusion.
[01:04:36.978 --> 01:04:40.621]  He shows how the whole New World Order works as a corporation.
[01:04:41.701 --> 01:04:42.722]  Oh yeah, I've seen that.
[01:04:42.762 --> 01:04:44.603]  We posted it last week.
[01:04:45.184 --> 01:04:46.825]  That's the Freeman Society.
[01:04:47.665 --> 01:04:48.165]  I don't know.
[01:04:48.906 --> 01:04:52.908]  I'm just looking at the good... I favorited it on my tube set.
[01:04:53.348 --> 01:04:54.909]  But it's a guy in England, right?
[01:04:54.929 --> 01:04:58.030]  Yeah, it's like a regular working guy who figured it all out.
[01:04:58.351 --> 01:05:00.011]  Well, we figured it out too.
[01:05:00.031 --> 01:05:01.672]  We've been covering that for more than a decade.
[01:05:01.692 --> 01:05:02.313]  Yes, you have.
[01:05:02.373 --> 01:05:04.474]  I'm not saying, oh, we figured it out.
[01:05:04.494 --> 01:05:05.374]  We're smart.
[01:05:05.634 --> 01:05:07.335]  I'm just saying, yes, everybody's figuring it out.
[01:05:07.635 --> 01:05:07.995]  Stay there.
[01:05:08.035 --> 01:05:11.057]  You can talk more about it when we come back and take more calls as well.
[01:05:11.597 --> 01:05:12.298]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:30.562]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:31.222 --> 01:06:32.243]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:32.764 --> 01:06:33.284]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:33.564 --> 01:06:34.465]  This is his ammo.
[01:06:34.485 --> 01:06:35.866]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:35.926 --> 01:06:37.607]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:37.927 --> 01:06:44.693]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:45.073 --> 01:06:45.513]  Some U.S.
[01:06:45.553 --> 01:06:51.218]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:51.898 --> 01:06:55.419]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:55.779 --> 01:07:05.622]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:07:05.862 --> 01:07:06.622]  Fabled Enemies.

[01:07:14.844 --> 01:07:18.205]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:25.508]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:07:25.628 --> 01:07:30.853]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:07:31.033 --> 01:07:35.817]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:07:36.198 --> 01:07:47.328]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.

[01:07:53.491 --> 01:07:59.554]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.

[01:08:27.045 --> 01:08:29.407]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:29.427 --> 01:08:35.091]  Okay, I've got some video clips I want to play coming up to you.
[01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:35.892]  We've got to hurry here.
[01:08:36.292 --> 01:08:38.134]  T, finish up the points you wanted to make, sir.
[01:08:38.854 --> 01:08:39.475]  Yeah, it was...
[01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:52.420]  It's really good how this guy, just a simple guy, working man, figures it all out and shows that the MPs are all traded in Dun & Bradstreet, listed as corporations, all of their courts are all listed as corporations.
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:55.103]  Prisoners in jails are everything.
[01:08:55.163 --> 01:09:01.008]  It's a global crime syndicate through corporate maritime administrative law.
[01:09:01.508 --> 01:09:01.969]  Correct.
[01:09:03.010 --> 01:09:04.571]  Anyways, and I also wanted to thank you.
[01:09:04.591 --> 01:09:06.132]  I always listen to your radio show.
[01:09:06.172 --> 01:09:08.975]  You have a great show and a great audience.
[01:09:09.977 --> 01:09:11.637]  Well, thank you, T. We appreciate your call.
[01:09:12.517 --> 01:09:15.518]  Let's talk to Abdullah in Ohio.
[01:09:15.558 --> 01:09:16.158]  You're on the air.
[01:09:16.178 --> 01:09:18.438]  How you doing?
[01:09:18.919 --> 01:09:19.759]  Hey, Alex, how are you?
[01:09:20.199 --> 01:09:20.459]  Good.
[01:09:21.259 --> 01:09:21.479]  Good.
[01:09:21.779 --> 01:09:25.020]  Hey, listen, I've been listening to you since May 2008.
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:31.401]  I think you've got a great show, good message, and, you know, it's real difficult waking people up to what you're talking about.
[01:09:31.421 --> 01:09:36.962]  I was talking to those people that I work with, and they just kind of accept being slaves, and it's ridiculous to me.
[01:09:36.982 --> 01:09:39.202]  I'm African-American, so it's really repulsive to me.
[01:09:39.932 --> 01:09:41.033]  That's a whole different subject.
[01:09:41.333 --> 01:09:55.246]  I called because I told the guy that answered your phone that I was actually in the masjid, or the mosque, as you guys call it, in Toledo, where they sent the FBI agent in to infiltrate and basically make a case against people.
[01:09:55.926 --> 01:10:02.472]  The point you made is that they choose the crazy people and they try to prop them up and make them into, you know, some kind of a criminal.
[01:10:02.892 --> 01:10:05.254]  Yeah, for those who don't know, let me stop you and I'll give you the floor.
[01:10:07.446 --> 01:10:14.954]  I talked an hour and a half ago about how we've had feds over and over again just show up at our events and say, Alex, let's go kill police.
[01:10:14.994 --> 01:10:16.876]  And I'm like, you're a big cop.
[01:10:16.956 --> 01:10:17.396]  What is this?
[01:10:17.657 --> 01:10:18.638]  You know we're nonviolent.
[01:10:18.658 --> 01:10:20.139]  Get out of here.
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.323]  Because when the police do that, that's a crime.
[01:10:24.443 --> 01:10:26.805]  It's not even entrapment, it's provocateuring.
[01:10:27.185 --> 01:10:31.567]  They are trying to get a crime committed where people get hurt and killed.
[01:10:32.047 --> 01:10:44.794]  And in the case in Ohio, it came out in the Associated Press during the trial that the guys weren't planning anything, they weren't doing anything, they were led by this FBI informant whose idea it was, he just got them to shoot their mouths off, yeah, you know.
[01:10:45.034 --> 01:10:46.395]  We ought to go ahead and do something.
[01:10:46.775 --> 01:10:50.316]  And then it was all over the news, a secret army of Muslims were going to kill everybody.
[01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:52.937]  They were deadly strike forces of the most vicious.
[01:10:53.157 --> 01:10:55.118]  They were planning to destroy all of America.
[01:10:55.338 --> 01:11:03.422]  The Black Street kids, who weren't even Muslim, it was Muslims, were planning an army attack on every major city and to destroy in total destruction.
[01:11:03.602 --> 01:11:08.864]  It was a nationwide network of the most powerful, savage control mechanisms ever seen.
[01:11:08.884 --> 01:11:09.524]  They were trained.
[01:11:09.544 --> 01:11:10.224]  They were ready.
[01:11:10.565 --> 01:11:11.005]  Oh my God.
[01:11:11.025 --> 01:11:12.685]  And then six months later it came out it was all staged.
[01:11:12.725 --> 01:11:13.166]  None of it was true.
[01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:13.806]  It was all made up.
[01:11:14.306 --> 01:11:16.766]  You know, everything that you say rings true to me because I
[01:11:41.766 --> 01:11:44.248]  The FBI, they investigated me.
[01:11:44.288 --> 01:11:45.649]  They came to my mother's house.
[01:11:45.689 --> 01:11:46.970]  They couldn't find where I lived.
[01:11:47.291 --> 01:11:48.431]  It was my mother's house.
[01:11:49.092 --> 01:11:51.154]  And me and my son-in-law come over to my mother's house.
[01:11:51.174 --> 01:11:53.175]  My dad had cancer at the time.
[01:11:53.456 --> 01:11:55.737]  I thought my dad died or something.
[01:11:56.218 --> 01:11:57.959]  And my mom's just like, come over.
[01:11:57.979 --> 01:11:59.160]  I want you to come over for a little while.
[01:11:59.541 --> 01:12:05.365]  And I get over there and there's like four FBI guys in my house, or Homeland Security, in my mom's house.
[01:12:06.166 --> 01:12:08.168]  They took my son-in-law in one room and grilled him.
[01:12:08.188 --> 01:12:09.749]  They took me in another room and grilled me.
[01:12:10.342 --> 01:12:18.307]  And you know, the strange part about it is, and you know, agendas being what they are, the mosque of that tent was mostly African American.
[01:12:18.347 --> 01:12:20.548]  The three people that they pulled out of there were all African Americans.
[01:12:20.908 --> 01:12:22.409]  I mean, it was planned from the beginning.
[01:12:22.749 --> 01:12:30.954]  The guy who was the FBI informant, talk about he was fearing for his life after everything was said and done, getting $50,000 or $300,000 or whatever he got.
[01:12:33.622 --> 01:12:36.503]  To come in and just, you know, make up a bunch of lies about people.
[01:12:36.803 --> 01:12:38.764]  I mean, it's repulsive.
[01:12:38.784 --> 01:12:42.526]  Well, it came out in the news that he was leading it and commanding it.
[01:12:43.066 --> 01:12:47.848]  I mean, there was... I mean, if I could tell you... I mean, I wish I had more time to tell you.
[01:12:47.868 --> 01:12:51.129]  I know you've got a quick break coming up, but... No, this is important.
[01:12:51.329 --> 01:12:53.110]  Tell folks what happened.
[01:12:53.130 --> 01:12:55.791]  Oh, this guy... I'm going to use a stupid analogy, okay?
[01:12:56.211 --> 01:13:00.573]  You could say you like Russian ballet on the Wii game system.
[01:13:00.853 --> 01:13:02.574]  This guy would tell you, oh, I've got a collection of that.
[01:13:03.098 --> 01:13:03.979]  And you know, just come out.
[01:13:04.359 --> 01:13:07.061]  Whatever you want to do, he wanted to do it with you all the time.
[01:13:07.081 --> 01:13:08.162]  I mean, it's just strange stuff.
[01:13:08.842 --> 01:13:14.326]  I went to the high school in Toledo, and everybody in the high school, I went to his two rival high schools.
[01:13:14.346 --> 01:13:18.329]  He said he went to the other high school, and just for the sake of Scott and Matt Cumber.
[01:13:18.509 --> 01:13:19.530]  He said he went to Matt Cumber.
[01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:23.853]  Everybody that I said I knew from there, he didn't know a doggone person.
[01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:25.214]  He swore up and down.
[01:13:25.274 --> 01:13:30.998]  He was on the border between Kuwait and Iraq when Saddam Hussein gave the order to attack Iraq.
[01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:33.146]  He said he was Special Forces.
[01:13:34.087 --> 01:13:38.210]  I had a Eastern Czechoslovakian gun.
[01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:39.692]  He said he was in Special Forces.
[01:13:39.972 --> 01:13:42.514]  That's at the height of the Cold War when he's supposed to be in there.
[01:13:42.794 --> 01:13:45.616]  He should know everything about this damn gun, being in Special Forces.
[01:13:46.016 --> 01:13:47.658]  He didn't even know what the damn gun was.
[01:13:47.798 --> 01:13:49.699]  It's obvious.
[01:13:49.719 --> 01:13:50.320]  Hold on, sir.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:53.983]  Specifically, was he trying to get you to, hey, we ought to attack somebody?
[01:13:54.723 --> 01:13:56.344]  No, he would drop little hints.
[01:13:57.250 --> 01:14:00.331]  You know, the mosque we attend, we spoke out against terrorism.
[01:14:00.611 --> 01:14:02.211]  We spoke out against all that stuff.
[01:14:02.231 --> 01:14:09.573]  So he was being careful, but I mean, the feds I've seen just openly sit down next to you in your seat at a restaurant and go, let's attack the State Department.
[01:14:09.973 --> 01:14:11.633]  And I'm like, what the hell are you talking about, man?
[01:14:11.653 --> 01:14:12.793]  I got a wife and kids!
[01:14:12.953 --> 01:14:14.053]  I'm a radio host!
[01:14:14.534 --> 01:14:22.375]  I'm not weird because I want to come cover world leaders setting up a world bank secretly in my country with Obama and Hillary in there secretly.
[01:14:22.815 --> 01:14:25.316]  You're right, I mean... Go ahead.
[01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:26.496]  They're a little bit more subtle.
[01:14:26.806 --> 01:14:29.768]  I mean, I'll put it like this.
[01:14:30.308 --> 01:14:34.390]  If I really want to infiltrate you, I'm not going to come in and say stuff that's counter to what you're trying to do.
[01:14:34.791 --> 01:14:36.372]  I'm going to know it better than you do.
[01:14:36.672 --> 01:14:41.735]  And I'm going to come in and say some things that will allow me to get in closer to what I consider to be the inner.
[01:14:41.755 --> 01:14:43.376]  No, I understand.
[01:14:43.396 --> 01:14:45.297]  So what would he say to you?
[01:14:45.357 --> 01:14:45.797]  He'd be lying.
[01:14:45.977 --> 01:14:48.118]  He just said, you know, I'm trying to learn Arabic.
[01:14:48.158 --> 01:14:49.899]  He learned Arabic to a certain extent.
[01:14:50.119 --> 01:14:51.060]  He was pretty proficient.
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:54.482]  I mean, he portrayed himself as a new convert.
[01:14:55.055 --> 01:14:56.176]  I don't think so.
[01:15:17.802 --> 01:15:22.267]  And so he, the guy that was in a different city, called and said, hey, I think this guy's a terrorist.
[01:15:22.327 --> 01:15:23.749]  And nothing happened to this guy.
[01:15:24.009 --> 01:15:25.091]  That's when we were all convinced.
[01:15:25.171 --> 01:15:33.341]  I mean, a lot of people that were in the surroundings... So the mosque is calling the feds, saying we think this guy's a terrorist, do something, and nothing happens to him.
[01:15:33.561 --> 01:15:34.001]  Nothing happens.
[01:15:34.462 --> 01:15:36.745]  Did he get the other guys to shoot their mouths off?
[01:15:37.609 --> 01:15:38.369]  Oh my God!
[01:15:39.689 --> 01:15:41.410]  Alex, the three guys, okay?
[01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:43.090]  There's three of them that were supposed to be in it.
[01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:46.491]  The one guy, I kind of knew, because he used to sell clothes and stuff.
[01:15:46.511 --> 01:15:47.071]  I bought clothes from him.
[01:15:47.091 --> 01:15:51.491]  Well, you know, they have stage deals where even the guys they bust are staged, and none of it's real.
[01:15:51.511 --> 01:15:55.792]  That's come out where they'll arrest a top al-Qaeda, and two years later it'll say, oh, it was really to protect him.
[01:15:56.292 --> 01:15:58.173]  We put him in witness protection.
[01:15:58.213 --> 01:15:58.953]  It wasn't real.
[01:15:59.733 --> 01:16:01.313]  Go ahead.
[01:16:01.653 --> 01:16:04.814]  He was the guy that always got a big deal, and it never came through.
[01:16:04.974 --> 01:16:06.754]  You know, I got $10 million coming in.
[01:16:07.113 --> 01:16:08.533]  You know, can I borrow $25 to get here?
[01:16:08.573 --> 01:16:10.154]  That's the kind of guy he was.
[01:16:10.454 --> 01:16:15.175]  The other two guys, I mean the one that went over to Jordan, that guy was mentally insane.
[01:16:15.495 --> 01:16:19.736]  He was, I mean, I don't know if you know anything about a lot of Arabs, but Arabs usually got money.
[01:16:20.196 --> 01:16:26.178]  This guy would come to a group of African Americans who were struggling, asking for $5 to get the bus to go to school every day.
[01:16:26.198 --> 01:16:30.099]  So I don't know where he got the money to go to Jordan, except that this guy paid for it.
[01:16:30.538 --> 01:16:31.078]  I don't think so.
[01:16:53.924 --> 01:16:57.285]  You're Muslim and you're guilty and it's okay.
[01:16:57.426 --> 01:17:04.168]  You should be a patriot and let the police come in and spy on you.
[01:17:04.428 --> 01:17:07.890]  There's all this about how they love the Arabs and they're not racist or bigoted.
[01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:10.691]  Let me tell you, in the military you're called hajis.
[01:17:11.411 --> 01:17:11.631]  Right.
[01:17:11.831 --> 01:17:16.633]  And you're not human and it's a big joke when they just shotgun a little kid and the kid blows in half.
[01:17:16.653 --> 01:17:17.734]  They go, rogue leader!
[01:17:17.754 --> 01:17:18.934]  How dare you little bastard!
[01:17:18.954 --> 01:17:19.794]  Look at him crying!
[01:17:21.405 --> 01:17:25.348]  I mean, it's just, you know, hey, let's get this family's car and run over it with a tank, and there's video.
[01:17:25.668 --> 01:17:27.049]  Ah, look at this family drive by!
[01:17:28.791 --> 01:17:37.097]  And it's just like... And these people think that they're going to be safe in a government run by people like this.
[01:17:37.697 --> 01:17:39.619]  No, they're going to loot and rob all of us, folks.
[01:17:39.719 --> 01:17:41.020]  Criminals are in control.
[01:17:41.786 --> 01:17:43.967]  You are 100% right, Alex.
[01:17:44.287 --> 01:17:54.614]  And by the way, they fund and train the military to commit these atrocities, and they put out the Abu Ghraib on purpose, the CIA put that out, that's been documented, to make America be hated!
[01:17:55.214 --> 01:18:03.679]  And now, they're saying, America's fault for everything, it's gonna implode, a new Bank of the World's gonna form, and you understand the mastermind set-up of this?
[01:18:04.359 --> 01:18:07.521]  Oh my God, Alex, everything you're saying is so true, man.
[01:18:08.022 --> 01:18:10.343]  Watching it from the inside, I mean, obviously,
[01:18:11.371 --> 01:18:12.672]  I had a very small run.
[01:18:13.173 --> 01:18:18.436]  I commend you for having the strength and courage to put up with this crap on a regular and daily basis.
[01:18:18.476 --> 01:18:19.277]  I know you're a target.
[01:18:19.659 --> 01:18:22.242]  I mean, I can't even imagine.
[01:18:22.262 --> 01:18:26.025]  They had helicopters following us and crap.
[01:18:26.045 --> 01:18:27.427]  You can't believe the stuff.
[01:18:27.507 --> 01:18:28.968]  I mean, I don't talk much about it on air.
[01:18:29.309 --> 01:18:30.310]  It's been quite a circus.
[01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:34.093]  But, you know, I just say, God, I'm trying to do the right thing.
[01:18:34.554 --> 01:18:36.616]  I try to, you know, just stay forward.
[01:18:36.776 --> 01:18:39.259]  And it's not even fear anymore.
[01:18:39.359 --> 01:18:41.721]  It's just more gripping, like jumping into cold ice water.
[01:18:42.862 --> 01:18:43.983]  Whoa, this is real!
[01:18:44.003 --> 01:18:54.310]  And you know, that's how I can be up here at 2, 3 in the morning totally exhausted with no sleep and keep working because I go anytime they can set me up, anytime they can kill me, I just gotta get, you know, more salvos into the enemy in the info war.
[01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:58.293]  You know, I mean literally, it's like I'm in a big gun firing at the enemy battleship that's coming at me firing.
[01:18:58.313 --> 01:18:59.934]  I'm like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:19:00.134 --> 01:19:00.294]  Hi, Alex.
[01:19:00.314 --> 01:19:00.534]  How are you?
[01:19:00.554 --> 01:19:01.674]  Actually, it's Rare Kandar on your forum.
[01:19:24.297 --> 01:19:29.402]  I need to say hi to all the folks on the forum, and especially J.P.
[01:19:29.442 --> 01:19:33.125]  Coyote for all of his excellent mentoring there.
[01:19:34.185 --> 01:19:42.332]  I'm just curious, have you ever had investigative journalist Mr. John Pilger on your program?
[01:19:43.433 --> 01:19:45.535]  That name rings a bell.
[01:19:45.655 --> 01:19:46.135]  Pilger.
[01:19:46.175 --> 01:19:48.357]  What's he do?
[01:19:48.797 --> 01:19:53.301]  Well, his recent documentary, War and Democracy,
[01:19:54.371 --> 01:19:58.553]  Just won the 2008 One World Award.
[01:19:59.353 --> 01:20:00.153]  Oh, One World!
[01:20:00.573 --> 01:20:00.934]  Stay there.
[01:20:00.954 --> 01:20:02.014]  I want to hear about it when we come back.
[01:20:02.074 --> 01:20:03.294]  Stay there from Taiwan.
[01:20:03.795 --> 01:20:08.116]  Then, Brenton, Montana, Adam in Florida, and Paul in California.
[01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:11.938]  That'll be it for calls, because then I've got to play some video clips, and have Jason Burmison's studio.
[01:20:11.978 --> 01:20:17.540]  His new show launches tonight at InfoWars.com on the audio streams at any M&M's stations that want to pick it up.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:21.161]  Tonight's the night to pick that up, and it'll also be over Genesis.
[01:20:21.912 --> 01:20:25.176]  What are you going to do if your family has no food in the event of an emergency?
[01:20:25.376 --> 01:20:28.379]  Do you really want to find out and gamble with your family's lives?
[01:20:28.599 --> 01:20:31.202]  Order a one-year supply that will feed four to five people for only $39.95.
[01:20:31.242 --> 01:20:34.766]  That's right, a one-year supply for under $4,000 from YourFoodStorage.com.
[01:20:39.599 --> 01:20:40.139]  We're good to go.
[01:20:59.730 --> 01:21:03.472]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero and we knew what to do.
[01:21:29.531 --> 01:21:30.572]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:21:30.792 --> 01:21:37.220]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:21:37.841 --> 01:21:46.371]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:21:46.724 --> 01:21:53.526]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:56.867]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:21:56.987 --> 01:22:02.228]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:22:02.748 --> 01:22:05.389]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:22:05.829 --> 01:22:13.071]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at
[01:22:15.250 --> 01:22:15.792]  We're good to go.
[01:22:21.823 --> 01:22:26.104]  Hello, this is Peter Kronschnabel from Midas Resources, and I'd like to share some thoughts with you.
[01:22:26.404 --> 01:22:38.327]  In today's economy, with the government spending gone wild, the banking system on the verge of collapse, and Wall Street in continuous freefall, we both know that it is critical that you protect your savings and retirement programs now.
[01:22:38.747 --> 01:22:43.768]  Macroeconomics can be very confusing, but the solution to securing your personal assets is very simple.
[01:22:44.329 --> 01:22:45.769]  It's purchase of gold and silver.
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:52.347]  These precious metals have been the trusted means of exchange for centuries, and they've never been more important in our country's history.
[01:22:53.007 --> 01:22:56.771]  It's up to you to design your survival plan, one based on gold and silver.
[01:22:57.312 --> 01:22:58.053]  Give me a call.
[01:22:58.113 --> 01:23:01.817]  I'm Peter Kronschnobloid, 800-686-2237, extension 108, and allow me to outline an easy answer to your questions.
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:08.462]  That's Peter Kranschnabel at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:23:08.502 --> 01:23:11.325]  Call Peter at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108, where you can still purchase gold with paper.
[01:23:21.089 --> 01:23:31.180]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:23:31.661 --> 01:23:32.722]  Garden in a Can!
[01:23:33.082 --> 01:23:36.666]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[01:23:37.227 --> 01:23:39.009]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.

[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:52.681]  Garden in a can.
[01:23:53.101 --> 01:23:53.962]  It's that simple.
[01:23:54.302 --> 01:23:54.602]  Fresh.
[01:23:55.022 --> 01:23:55.403]  Healthy.
[01:23:55.883 --> 01:23:56.163]  Easy.
[01:23:56.704 --> 01:24:00.647]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[01:24:01.047 --> 01:24:01.928]  Ready when you are.

[01:24:35.619 --> 01:24:38.560]  Run on for a long time.
[01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:41.321]  Run on for a long time.
[01:24:42.041 --> 01:24:44.482]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:24:45.022 --> 01:24:47.423]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:24:49.631 --> 01:25:03.261]  Go tell that long-tongued liar, go and tell that midnight rider, tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter, tell them that God's gonna... That's right, we trust in God.
[01:25:03.541 --> 01:25:04.702]  That is our fortress.
[01:25:06.363 --> 01:25:09.745]  All right, going back to Rare in Taiwan.
[01:25:09.765 --> 01:25:10.706]  Finish up your comments.
[01:25:10.946 --> 01:25:13.328]  Yeah, again, that's Rare Condor.
[01:25:13.448 --> 01:25:13.868]  Anyways,
[01:25:17.116 --> 01:25:30.199]  Yeah, the film is basically, probably the most important part about it is how the United States government backed the elites, supported the elites in Chile to overthrow the government.
[01:25:31.459 --> 01:25:32.960]  I forget the president's name now.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:42.822]  But how it got twisted around and how the people came back, the regular people, and
[01:25:44.676 --> 01:25:45.276]  Took him back.
[01:25:45.516 --> 01:25:46.076]  Got him back.
[01:25:46.156 --> 01:25:47.217]  Put him back into government.
[01:25:47.597 --> 01:25:48.417]  Re-installed him.
[01:25:49.237 --> 01:25:50.637]  It's a very interesting film.
[01:25:51.858 --> 01:25:53.498]  Again, it's War on Democracy.
[01:25:54.398 --> 01:25:57.259]  You can Google it and watch it for free.
[01:25:57.719 --> 01:25:58.759]  It's very interesting.
[01:25:59.099 --> 01:26:00.039]  Alright, got it brother.
[01:26:00.059 --> 01:26:01.720]  Anything else from Taiwan?
[01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:04.100]  No, sir.
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:05.560]  Nothing at all.
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:06.701]  Thank you very much.
[01:26:06.881 --> 01:26:07.741]  Appreciate the call.
[01:26:08.761 --> 01:26:12.242]  Let's go to Brent in Montana.
[01:26:12.262 --> 01:26:12.902]  You're on the air.
[01:26:14.366 --> 01:26:15.047]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:26:15.547 --> 01:26:15.887]  Good, sir.
[01:26:16.968 --> 01:26:21.431]  Hey, I just wanted to thank you, first and foremost, for what you're doing for the country.
[01:26:22.011 --> 01:26:25.734]  And I believe that you're a patriot for what you do.
[01:26:26.034 --> 01:26:26.394]  Thank you.
[01:26:27.495 --> 01:26:28.336]  I'm on a mission.
[01:26:29.857 --> 01:26:30.237]  I'm sorry?
[01:26:30.737 --> 01:26:31.458]  I'm on a mission.
[01:26:32.098 --> 01:26:32.499]  Thank you.
[01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:34.460]  Thank you, sir.
[01:26:35.341 --> 01:26:39.203]  I just wanted to say real quick that I'm new to all of this.
[01:26:39.423 --> 01:26:40.764]  I'm new to politics.
[01:26:43.963 --> 01:26:46.564]  It's been quite an eye-opener.
[01:26:47.364 --> 01:26:50.484]  This past election is what got me into it.
[01:26:51.125 --> 01:26:58.926]  My mom got me into Fox News at first, and just one thing led to another, led to another.
[01:26:58.946 --> 01:27:07.088]  I eventually found your show, and you've opened my eyes to quite a few things.
[01:27:07.448 --> 01:27:12.829]  I listen to a lot of the radio shows out there, just about all of them, and I think you're
[01:27:13.887 --> 01:27:18.251]  Uh, the best out there because you're speaking the actual truth.
[01:27:18.871 --> 01:27:26.418]  The other guys, they're great, but it's like they're scared to talk about what really needs to be talked about.
[01:27:28.219 --> 01:27:29.120]  Or they nitpick.
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:29.580]  A lot of them.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:30.561]  There's a lot of great folks though.
[01:27:30.922 --> 01:27:35.425]  Some of them nitpick about everybody else and it's a personal power trip.
[01:27:36.391 --> 01:27:41.835]  I just want to say that I'm really disgusted as an American what is going on with our country.
[01:27:41.855 --> 01:27:43.095]  I served in the Marine Corps for four years.
[01:28:04.804 --> 01:28:13.427]  You know, and the first time I came back from my first West Pack, I literally kissed the ground when I came back, and I cried.
[01:28:13.607 --> 01:28:24.111]  I was happy to be back in America, and I'm just really saddened by what's going on.
[01:28:25.171 --> 01:28:32.574]  It really bothers me, and I just got done watching one of your videos on the
[01:28:34.242 --> 01:28:37.204]  Uh, Bohemian Grove that you did nine years ago.
[01:28:37.224 --> 01:28:44.390]  And one of the things that you said was that even if you're an atheist, you should be very disturbed by this.
[01:28:45.130 --> 01:28:46.871]  And you hit it on the money.
[01:28:48.012 --> 01:28:55.077]  And, um, you know, I've been pretty much raised atheist, by an atheist, my entire life.
[01:28:56.158 --> 01:29:01.222]  Um, I don't consider myself an atheist anymore, but for the majority of my life, I have, I was.
[01:29:01.242 --> 01:29:02.322]  And, um,
[01:29:04.631 --> 01:29:17.394]  Even... I believe you're right, even atheists should be... Well, the New World Order programmers have taken over Christianity to put out a false Christianity to make it look wicked and evil.
[01:29:17.694 --> 01:29:21.855]  But when you really study the New World Order, you find out they're a cultist and they hate real Christians.
[01:29:22.336 --> 01:29:27.917]  And you find out that that is the major battle line, and they just don't want people to realize that, and then they...
[01:29:28.297 --> 01:29:43.291]  You know, truly, when you tap into God, when you tap into, you know, that we're a species and that we're all interconnected and you do reap what you sow, and when you tap into the fact there is evil, there is good, then the whole system, the whole panacea, the whole...
[01:29:44.412 --> 01:29:45.173]  Thank you, Brent.
[01:30:04.124 --> 01:30:06.246]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[01:31:22.137 --> 01:31:28.562]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:28.882 --> 01:31:30.584]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:31.519 --> 01:31:32.540]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:33.061 --> 01:31:33.581]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:33.861 --> 01:31:34.722]  This is his M.O.
[01:31:34.762 --> 01:31:36.164]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:36.224 --> 01:31:37.906]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:38.226 --> 01:31:44.993]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:45.393 --> 01:31:45.834]  Some U.S.
[01:31:45.874 --> 01:31:51.560]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:55.683]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:55.703 --> 01:31:57.865]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:22.179 --> 01:32:27.842]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[01:32:28.122 --> 01:32:32.904]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[01:32:33.144 --> 01:32:38.126]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[01:32:38.326 --> 01:32:41.768]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[01:32:42.248 --> 01:32:50.436]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[01:32:50.776 --> 01:32:56.161]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[01:32:56.581 --> 01:33:02.327]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:33:02.567 --> 01:33:04.889]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:07.570]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment?

[01:33:26.542 --> 01:33:31.525]  In the morning you go running For the man who stole your heart
[01:33:41.627 --> 01:33:43.328]  Alright, I want to play a few audio clips.
[01:33:43.368 --> 01:33:44.890]  This is from FederalJack.com.
[01:33:44.930 --> 01:33:47.472]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:48.292 --> 01:33:51.675]  CFR Professor reveals plot for military coup in 2012.
[01:33:52.516 --> 01:33:54.697]  Now, this is a military coup.
[01:33:54.717 --> 01:33:55.738]  The Pentagon's announced.
[01:33:56.058 --> 01:33:57.459]  NORTHCOM dominates the U.S.
[01:33:57.499 --> 01:33:58.700]  Congress is ceremonial.
[01:33:58.981 --> 01:34:00.102]  The governors are ceremonial.
[01:34:00.462 --> 01:34:01.543]  And the states are saying no.
[01:34:02.063 --> 01:34:04.625]  Feds, you were created by us.
[01:34:05.145 --> 01:34:08.248]  And under the 9th and 10th Amendment, we are declaring sovereignty and saying no to you.
[01:34:08.268 --> 01:34:10.430]  I want to play just a few minutes of this.
[01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:13.290]  It's again up on InfoWars.com.
[01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:14.451]  Folks on the radio can hear the audio.
[01:34:14.471 --> 01:34:16.231]  PrisonPlanet.tv viewers can watch it right now.
[01:34:16.611 --> 01:34:18.932]  But we have links to it for everybody up on InfoWars.com.
[01:34:18.972 --> 01:34:19.332]  Here it is.
[01:34:23.212 --> 01:34:24.453]  You guys pumping me some audio in there?
[01:34:25.593 --> 01:34:31.414]  Okay, let's rewind that and while we're figuring this out, we've made some studio changes in here for the upcoming new show.
[01:34:31.894 --> 01:34:33.715]  So who knows what's going on with that.
[01:34:33.735 --> 01:34:39.936]  But let's cue it back up and see if we can get some audio on that feed so we can play that audio
[01:34:40.922 --> 01:34:41.662]  Feed for everybody.
[01:34:41.682 --> 01:34:45.724]  Okay, I have a backup system of Minnesota.
[01:34:45.804 --> 01:34:47.785]  Minnesota, this is Cape Canaveral calling.
[01:34:48.126 --> 01:34:50.747]  You have the CFR audio clip I sent you, right?
[01:34:51.848 --> 01:34:52.408]  It's all ready?
[01:34:52.428 --> 01:34:54.189]  Go ahead and play that for folks.
[01:34:54.829 --> 01:35:03.033]  The second question that I'd like to pose relates to the forces driving the emergence of the second world.
[01:35:03.974 --> 01:35:10.237]  And have they had an unintentional impact on something that has not been mentioned as well
[01:35:10.925 --> 01:35:16.068]  Today, in any of the discussions, namely civil-military relations in the United States.
[01:35:16.088 --> 01:35:21.912]  I'd like to call your attention to an analysis by Charles Dunlap in the U.S.
[01:35:21.972 --> 01:35:26.535]  Army War College's academic magazine called Parameters.
[01:35:27.396 --> 01:35:34.440]  In this analysis, Mr. Dunlap predicts that there will be a military coup in the United States in the year 2012.
[01:35:36.249 --> 01:35:43.653]  In part, because we've asked our military to do too much outside of the traditional national security realm.
[01:35:45.774 --> 01:36:05.964]  For Mr. Kahnam, has the emergence of the Second World been so destabilizing as to lead to mission creep to the extent that it could lead the Army War College to predict, unofficially of course, that there will be a military coup within the next three to four years.
[01:36:06.366 --> 01:36:07.127]  Alright, stop right there.
[01:36:07.987 --> 01:36:15.653]  There's already been a military coup, but this is what the Army War College is saying they're going to do separately, and then they write other reports saying this is going to happen.
[01:36:17.314 --> 01:36:20.276]  This is what happens when the military gets involved in your daily life.
[01:36:20.317 --> 01:36:21.637]  It's why it's been illegal here.
[01:36:21.658 --> 01:36:29.984]  It's not illegal in the Congo, not illegal in Mexico, not illegal in Russia, not illegal in China, wasn't illegal in Nazi Germany,
[01:36:31.533 --> 01:36:32.013]  It happened.
[01:36:32.474 --> 01:36:33.695]  It will happen.
[01:36:33.755 --> 01:36:34.796]  It is happening.
[01:36:34.816 --> 01:36:36.437]  The denial has to end.
[01:36:38.079 --> 01:36:41.081]  Okay, were we able to get audio and video back?
[01:36:42.062 --> 01:36:43.524]  Just never again we'll have it, okay.
[01:36:45.105 --> 01:36:45.505]  Ah, boy.
[01:36:46.586 --> 01:36:49.008]  That's a good thing for you tonight with the show coming up that you know that now.
[01:36:50.109 --> 01:36:58.257]  Let's go ahead and play the audio of Ron Paul at the big CPAC Neocon meeting where he talks about, we killed a million plus Iraqis.
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:03.584]  And he talks about how war isn't good and the people actually cheer him.
[01:37:04.005 --> 01:37:10.053]  Showing that mainline conservatives, you got the most donations from the military of any candidate, actually aren't for this.
[01:37:10.073 --> 01:37:12.636]  Just like the media claims all Hispanics want open borders.
[01:37:12.936 --> 01:37:14.418]  Gallup poll shows upwards of 80% or higher.
[01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:16.981]  That's groupthink.
[01:37:17.021 --> 01:37:20.827]  A Hispanic goes, well I better be for open borders then because all Hispanics are for it.
[01:37:20.887 --> 01:37:21.288]  Not true.
[01:37:21.528 --> 01:37:22.169]  I'm a conservative.
[01:37:22.209 --> 01:37:23.891]  I better be for war because all conservatives are for it.
[01:37:24.092 --> 01:37:26.796]  Now the Democrats are like, well I guess we're pro-war because now Obama's for it.
[01:37:27.297 --> 01:37:28.398]  This is this groupthink.
[01:37:28.759 --> 01:37:31.623]  Let's go ahead and play the Ron Paul speech.
[01:37:31.663 --> 01:37:31.984]  Here it is.
[01:37:34.022 --> 01:37:36.603]  So we ought to address the subject of foreign policy.
[01:37:36.763 --> 01:37:40.724]  Part of the reasons why we lost this last election was the foreign policy issue.
[01:37:41.165 --> 01:37:48.107]  Generally speaking, the presidential candidate who argues the case for less war mongering will win the election.
[01:37:48.968 --> 01:37:51.228]  And, of course, Obama took the advantage of it.
[01:37:51.248 --> 01:37:57.171]  You know, he says, I'm going to end war in Iraq, and I'm going to bring those troops home and solve all the problems.
[01:37:57.791 --> 01:37:59.691]  And he won the election.
[01:38:00.152 --> 01:38:02.693]  So this generally is the case.
[01:38:02.933 --> 01:38:03.693]  But the truth is,
[01:38:04.315 --> 01:38:05.936]  Foreign policy hasn't changed.
[01:38:06.357 --> 01:38:10.059]  We should be looking more to what George Bush said in the year 2000.
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:19.846]  He was strongly critical of the Clinton years, of nation building and being in the policeman of the world, what we were doing in Bosnia and Somalia.
[01:38:20.367 --> 01:38:21.568]  And he won the election.
[01:38:21.788 --> 01:38:23.429]  He said some very, very good things.
[01:38:23.809 --> 01:38:37.612]  But after that, he again joined the internationalists, joined this idea that the American taxpayers, you, have an obligation to take care of everybody and police the world and put our military out there and be exposed to all this danger.
[01:38:38.012 --> 01:38:39.232]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:38:39.632 --> 01:38:41.953]  This is literally what bankrupts the country.
[01:38:42.273 --> 01:38:43.913]  It's the international expenditures.
[01:38:43.973 --> 01:38:49.194]  It costs us a trillion dollars a year to take care of our foreign policy.
[01:38:49.594 --> 01:38:50.954]  And that cannot last.
[01:38:51.115 --> 01:38:53.495]  And it is coming to an end.
[01:38:54.266 --> 01:39:01.123]  As a matter of fact,
[01:39:01.846 --> 01:39:14.792]  The person most pleased with our foreign policy is Osama Bin Laden because he has written about this and he said, I am going to get you to come over here and we'll fight you on our sand and we will do what we did to the Soviets.
[01:39:15.152 --> 01:39:22.335]  Of course, we helped him do what he did to the Soviets because we subsidized and supported him to drain the Soviets.
[01:39:22.716 --> 01:39:24.516]  And he said he will do the same thing.
[01:39:24.556 --> 01:39:26.597]  He will eventually bankrupt this country.
[01:39:27.178 --> 01:39:29.959]  And lo and behold, we are weaker for it.
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:33.063]  Our military personnel are fatigued.
[01:39:33.543 --> 01:39:36.327]  I was very proud of what happened last year in the campaign.
[01:39:36.787 --> 01:39:42.295]  Because I talk about the old, conservative, Republican, non-interventionist, constitutional foreign policy.
[01:39:42.795 --> 01:39:48.603]  And we, in our campaign, got the most money than any candidate from the military.
[01:39:58.308 --> 01:40:05.692]  But historically, great nations end when they overextend themselves overseas, whether it's back to the Roman days or the Soviets or whatever.
[01:40:06.232 --> 01:40:15.296]  The country feels so emboldened that they go and they think themselves as being overly wonderful and that we are going to spread our message.
[01:40:15.756 --> 01:40:23.000]  It actually started in World War I. The truth is, there was no need for us to be involved in World War I. But who wasn't?
[01:40:26.425 --> 01:40:27.186]  There it was.
[01:40:27.466 --> 01:40:33.093]  Woodrow Wilson said, we have to do it because we have to make the world safe for democracy, which led to this.
[01:40:33.533 --> 01:40:37.438]  Millions, hundreds of millions of people killed in the 20th century.
[01:40:37.718 --> 01:40:39.680]  So we're back at the same thing.
[01:40:40.001 --> 01:40:42.384]  We have to go and spread our goodness in the Middle East.
[01:40:42.704 --> 01:40:45.327]  So yeah, we wanted to get rid of a bad guy in Iraq.
[01:40:45.467 --> 01:40:45.888]  We did.
[01:40:46.468 --> 01:40:53.349]  But it cost, it cost, it cost, it took another one million Iraqis got killed.
[01:40:53.629 --> 01:40:56.930]  Believe me, they weren't, they weren't all terrorists.
[01:40:57.190 --> 01:40:59.611]  Some people didn't particularly like that.
[01:41:00.191 --> 01:41:06.452]  But nevertheless, it pleased Osama bin Laden because we were there, we were bankrupting our country.
[01:41:06.892 --> 01:41:11.353]  And right now, today, we get a new president that says he doesn't like
[01:41:11.713 --> 01:41:13.494]  He didn't like the war that was going on.
[01:41:13.835 --> 01:41:14.755]  So what are we going to do?
[01:41:14.796 --> 01:41:20.400]  We're going to drag another 17,000 Americans and pump them into Afghanistan.
[01:41:21.277 --> 01:41:23.678]  Don't we know anything about history?
[01:41:24.018 --> 01:41:25.759]  It is bankrupting our country.
[01:41:26.119 --> 01:41:30.960]  It will end, whether the people agree with me or not, it will end because we can't afford it.
[01:41:30.980 --> 01:41:33.081]  That's the way it's always ended throughout history.
[01:41:33.381 --> 01:41:35.722]  That's what the financial crisis is telling us.
[01:41:36.102 --> 01:41:44.425]  The welfare state will end because the money will quit working and we will no longer be able to afford to promote what we're doing around the world.
[01:41:44.765 --> 01:41:47.266]  And the sooner we realize that, the better.
[01:41:50.049 --> 01:41:55.251]  All right, well that was Congressman Ron Paul and obviously I disagree with him about the Osama Bin Laden thing.
[01:41:55.271 --> 01:41:58.352]  The real Osama Bin Laden letters that came out said he didn't do 9-11.
[01:41:58.732 --> 01:42:02.953]  He was a CIA operative and his family builds all the major U.S.
[01:42:02.973 --> 01:42:05.134]  military bases in Saudi Arabia and surrounding areas.
[01:42:05.634 --> 01:42:18.078]  But he's playing politics with the CPAC and bringing up that real terrorism, real terrorist groups, anybody that resists, has been increased by the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:42:18.738 --> 01:42:21.340]  And there they are cheering to not wanting to be in the war.
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:25.202]  Cheering when they're shown the logic of all of this.
[01:42:25.242 --> 01:42:26.003]  This is CPAC.
[01:42:26.803 --> 01:42:30.305]  And he was the lone voice there out of all the Republicans that were there.
[01:42:30.385 --> 01:42:34.228]  Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity and countless others in that two-day event.
[01:42:34.608 --> 01:42:39.491]  Rush Limbaugh's speech was carried on Fox and C-SPAN, but not Ron Paul's should have been.
[01:42:41.445 --> 01:42:47.609]  Though it was carried on some national news stations, because the establishment's having to admit Ron Paul is huge.
[01:42:47.969 --> 01:42:49.230]  Ron Paul is having an effect.
[01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:53.053]  People are really waking up to the message that the banks are behind it and engineering it.
[01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:57.716]  I want to get into, with Jason Bermas, this global new deal.
[01:42:58.156 --> 01:42:59.777]  And Gordon Brown is always calling for a new rule of order.
[01:42:59.797 --> 01:43:07.002]  The Prime Minister of England coming over here to sell this new global banking system to stop the bad banks, who are the ones setting up
[01:43:07.682 --> 01:43:10.086]  And that financed him and are setting up the global banking system.
[01:43:10.106 --> 01:43:12.088]  So we're going to go to that here in just a moment.
[01:43:12.128 --> 01:43:17.015]  First off, a few sponsors I want folks to know about that make this radio show possible.
[01:43:17.075 --> 01:43:18.598]  Survivalseedbank.com.
[01:43:18.638 --> 01:43:22.062]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability
[01:43:23.407 --> 01:43:26.830]  To grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[01:43:27.130 --> 01:43:32.354]  There have been times in American history, Pilgrim for example, when seeds had the highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold.
[01:43:32.655 --> 01:43:34.436]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds.
[01:43:34.456 --> 01:43:37.138]  I've got a BBC article about another giant UN vault of them.
[01:43:38.376 --> 01:43:40.757]  Governments are storing seeds all over the planet.
[01:43:41.517 --> 01:43:48.058]  Solutions from science are trying to get the seeds out of the globalist's hands and into the hands of the people, one seed bank at a time, one family at a time.
[01:43:48.099 --> 01:43:52.000]  Survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, or survivalseedbank.com.
[01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:53.160]  Great seeds, non-hybrid, non-GMO.
[01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:55.881]  And then lastly, and we're going to Jason Bermas, a cola blue.
[01:44:06.252 --> 01:44:09.794]  AcolaBlue.com, atmospheric water generator for your home.
[01:44:10.154 --> 01:44:13.316]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[01:44:13.356 --> 01:44:15.077]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride.
[01:44:15.137 --> 01:44:16.778]  Unlimited water from humidity in the air.
[01:44:17.098 --> 01:44:19.160]  Machine produces up to 7.5 gallons a day.
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:22.061]  In fact, that's what I drink here in the office.
[01:44:22.281 --> 01:44:23.142]  Can I have a glass of that?
[01:44:23.162 --> 01:44:25.423]  Because my throat's been a bit dry and I was wanting water earlier.
[01:44:25.663 --> 01:44:26.024]  Thank you.
[01:44:27.004 --> 01:44:31.367]  So again, great tasting, pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.
[01:44:32.518 --> 01:44:34.039]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:35.240]  Neutral pH.
[01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:36.681]  And I say on the ad it has five filters.
[01:44:36.721 --> 01:44:37.202]  They corrected me.
[01:44:37.222 --> 01:44:37.982]  It's seven filters.
[01:44:38.002 --> 01:44:38.883]  877-691-6043 800-691-6043 or coloblue.com
[01:44:47.557 --> 01:44:50.560]  Without further ado, Jason Burmiss, very excited to have you here.
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:57.507]  You're going to be starting your new show here out of my studio via Genesis Communications, coming up this evening, 9 to midnight central.
[01:44:57.547 --> 01:44:58.307]  Good to have you here, Jason.
[01:44:58.448 --> 01:44:59.288]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:44:59.629 --> 01:45:00.089]  You bet, buddy.
[01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:03.833]  Tell us a little bit about the show, then let's get into this stack of news you have here.
[01:45:04.173 --> 01:45:06.374]  Sure, you know, my new show is going to be Monday through Friday.
[01:45:06.415 --> 01:45:16.981]  It's called The Info Warrior with Jason Burmess and we're going to be covering, you know, globalist agendas, New World Order stuff, SciTech, really trying to blitz through news and information.
[01:45:17.021 --> 01:45:22.545]  I think, you know, what we're about to talk about, Gordon Brown, head of the UK, really pushing for globalization here.
[01:45:22.785 --> 01:45:27.409]  And admitting, Alex, over the weekend, to a global shadow banking system.
[01:45:27.429 --> 01:45:37.217]  You see, this is something that you have talked about since the inception of your show, and now the EU leaders are talking about it, in order to establish not only that it's real, but more global supervision.
[01:45:37.277 --> 01:45:38.238]  But it's a bait-and-switch.
[01:45:38.718 --> 01:45:42.041]  Oh, you've discovered there's a secret global banking system that ran the collapse?
[01:45:42.101 --> 01:45:49.207]  Oh, we're gonna fix it with a new global bank made up of the very banks running it all, and it'll be called the New World Order.
[01:45:49.247 --> 01:45:50.207]  It's all over the news.
[01:45:51.068 --> 01:45:53.010]  I mean, this is an incredible bait-and-switch.
[01:45:53.130 --> 01:45:53.350]  Absolutely.
[01:45:53.370 --> 01:45:57.874]  This is like a bank robber when the police show up, dressing in a police uniform, going, they went that way.
[01:45:58.614 --> 01:46:00.376]  Let me manage the bank next time.
[01:46:00.436 --> 01:46:01.056]  I'll fix it.
[01:46:01.296 --> 01:46:01.877]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:46:01.897 --> 01:46:03.698]  Let me just read a couple of the quotes right here.
[01:46:04.579 --> 01:46:08.842]  He is calling for a more rigorous global supervision of a banking system on Saturday.
[01:46:09.242 --> 01:46:15.928]  And he's saying that this is a, we have to have global supervision of what is a shadow global system.
[01:46:16.368 --> 01:46:19.609]  Here he calls it an international shadow banking system.
[01:46:19.849 --> 01:46:21.430]  An international shadow banking system.
[01:46:21.690 --> 01:46:24.531]  Something, again, you have talked about for over a decade.
[01:46:24.831 --> 01:46:34.734]  But the problem is... Hey, I have a news article I was going through a stack from two months ago with the head of the Rothschild family saying, we're setting up a global government, the final global bank's about to be set up, world government.
[01:46:35.094 --> 01:46:36.894]  I mean, it's just all over the news.
[01:46:37.094 --> 01:46:37.455]  It's there.
[01:46:37.775 --> 01:46:41.196]  And, you know, he's also calling for a global new deal with the U.S.
[01:46:41.396 --> 01:46:41.896]  It's right here.
[01:46:42.296 --> 01:46:42.576]  Okay.
[01:46:43.056 --> 01:46:44.317]  This is financial terrorism.
[01:46:44.337 --> 01:46:47.837]  They're saying, let us have our world government and then we'll turn the economy back on.
[01:46:47.957 --> 01:46:48.958]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:46:48.978 --> 01:47:00.141]  Because they got us debilitated on a respirator, and then they turned the respirator off, they hit us on the head, drained our blood, put us on a respirator, and they're leaning over to Schilling, give us total control and we'll turn the respirator back on.
[01:47:00.181 --> 01:47:01.021]  Do you agree?
[01:47:01.041 --> 01:47:02.341]  Do you agree?
[01:47:02.361 --> 01:47:07.202]  He wants President Obama to agree to bold global action, a global grand bargain.
[01:47:07.662 --> 01:47:09.423]  It's now not just necessary, but vital.
[01:47:09.983 --> 01:47:11.665]  For a world economy.
[01:47:11.745 --> 01:47:19.575]  And here he's saying that we need this global New Deal in order to have a truly global society.
[01:47:19.595 --> 01:47:22.299]  It's all about globalism, Alex.
[01:47:22.719 --> 01:47:25.643]  And you know, talk about global government for a global crisis.
[01:47:25.683 --> 01:47:26.825]  Talk about global picks.
[01:47:27.185 --> 01:47:28.025]  Uh, what do we have here?
[01:47:28.065 --> 01:47:32.287]  Well, he just named Sebelius, who is the Kansas governor, who was of course at the Bilderberg Group.
[01:47:32.307 --> 01:47:34.728]  She's on the official list to his administration.
[01:47:35.008 --> 01:47:42.710]  So if people out there don't understand that these secret meetings are where they decide who's going to be in the administration, it's right here, okay?
[01:47:42.910 --> 01:47:51.653]  It's not a coincidence that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were at the Bilderberg meeting this year, and that they're taking Bilderbergers into their administration.
[01:47:51.953 --> 01:47:56.495]  We need to get this out there, Alex, because this shadow system is becoming
[01:47:56.835 --> 01:48:05.522]  More and more out in the open, and we have to make sure that they don't pull this bait-and-switch where they offer just another globalist solution to a problem that they created.
[01:48:06.063 --> 01:48:06.984]  And it's not a problem!
[01:48:07.324 --> 01:48:09.766]  That's why we have Henry Kissinger in, in those same articles.
[01:48:09.786 --> 01:48:11.587]  There's two from the Times of London with Brown.
[01:48:11.868 --> 01:48:14.069]  He's saying this crisis is not a crisis.
[01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:16.992]  It's an opportunity to bring in a new order.
[01:48:17.332 --> 01:48:18.633]  A new world order.
[01:48:18.893 --> 01:48:21.395]  We will defeat the vicious evil banks.
[01:48:22.296 --> 01:48:24.138]  With the very same bankers ruling us.
[01:48:24.198 --> 01:48:25.700]  That's how we'll defeat them.
[01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:31.305]  And you know, Alex, this seems to tie in with the carbon credit system because this is... No, no, I got it all in the documents.
[01:48:31.325 --> 01:48:32.807]  You're gonna pay your carbon credits to them.
[01:48:32.967 --> 01:48:35.830]  And Gordon Brown is one of these guys... How dare you, you vicious man!
[01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:38.613]  He is just a global warming fearmonger.
[01:48:38.673 --> 01:48:38.953]  Seize him!
[01:48:38.973 --> 01:48:39.714]  Seize him immediately!
[01:48:40.054 --> 01:48:48.277]  In fact, you know, I think I printed you an article last week that you didn't go over, but now they're saying that toilet paper, Alex, it's worse than SUVs and us Americans.
[01:48:48.297 --> 01:48:57.259]  No, beef, chicken, asphalt, natural gas, your homes, windows, trash pickup, thousands of new taxes.
[01:48:57.299 --> 01:48:58.060]  I keep saying hundreds.
[01:48:58.100 --> 01:49:00.160]  I mean, doing research for this film, it's everything.
[01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:05.602]  Everything with federal international taxes paid directly to the New Bank of the World.
[01:49:05.762 --> 01:49:07.803]  I mean, really, what's it going to be like in 20 years?
[01:49:07.823 --> 01:49:09.263]  Are we just going to get a government election?
[01:49:09.283 --> 01:49:09.463]  20 years?!
[01:49:09.683 --> 01:49:12.384]  They've announced they're going to put satellite tracker boxes in all the cars.
[01:49:12.645 --> 01:49:16.586]  Yeah, well, I think that's even, probably in the next 5, 10, I don't think that's even going to be 20 down the line.
[01:49:16.606 --> 01:49:18.047]  I mean, if we don't do anything... No, no, no, no.
[01:49:18.087 --> 01:49:19.627]  States are already putting it in, like Oregon.
[01:49:19.787 --> 01:49:22.728]  They're doing tests here in Austin with people, with them in their cars.
[01:49:23.249 --> 01:49:26.090]  And then when opposition builds, Obama goes, we're not going to do that right now.
[01:49:26.150 --> 01:49:26.950]  And then they move forward.
[01:49:27.930 --> 01:49:29.972]  Well, I mean, you know, people are still bamboozled.
[01:49:30.072 --> 01:49:38.700]  I don't hear the outcry now to end the war, now that Obama has given us this very convenient... No, no, now I have liberals when we go downtown to videotape clips for the film, what do you think of Obama?
[01:49:38.721 --> 01:49:40.943]  It's like, he's got to keep the troops there for security.
[01:49:41.683 --> 01:49:42.164]  Yeah.
[01:49:42.204 --> 01:49:45.847]  Well, he said that the secret arrest is going to continue to keep it safe from Al-Qaeda.
[01:49:48.372 --> 01:49:50.174]  And you just can't get through to them.
[01:49:50.414 --> 01:49:57.759]  I mean, when you now tell somebody that he's planning to have combat troops, and there's no such thing as a non-combat troop, in there until the end of 2011.
[01:49:57.899 --> 01:50:01.502]  Okay, this is yet staging for another election year.
[01:50:01.562 --> 01:50:03.404]  He's going to redistribute the forces into Afghanistan.
[01:50:03.584 --> 01:50:07.567]  But even at the end of 2011, he's saying 50,000 troops.
[01:50:08.147 --> 01:50:10.369]  And I'm not going to be surprised when we get to 2011 and it's not 50,000, it's 150,000.
[01:50:13.431 --> 01:50:19.779]  And the Iraqi Special Forces that we've trained are now going into places like Afghanistan and other parts of the Middle East, aiding us.
[01:50:20.039 --> 01:50:21.160]  You know, they're going to be our allies.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:26.106]  And we're really... And again, that psychology, you say us, and I do that too, like it's still our military, still our country.
[01:50:26.366 --> 01:50:30.531]  Until we realize it's not our government, it's not our military, and take it back, it's only going to get worse.
[01:50:30.772 --> 01:50:30.992]  I agree.
[01:50:31.292 --> 01:50:36.715]  I agree, and I really hope that people step up and take this president and his administration to task.
[01:50:36.995 --> 01:50:46.419]  Folks, 2011, especially, they're talking December of 2011, is completely and totally unacceptable, and it's not even a complete withdrawal.
[01:50:46.539 --> 01:50:58.985]  No, no, no, they're saying major combat operations will be over in a year and a half, or longer, when Bush said six months into the war, five and a half years ago, that major combat operations were now over.
[01:50:59.045 --> 01:50:59.465]  It was over.
[01:50:59.665 --> 01:51:03.727]  So he's using the same old Pentagon tricks over and over again.
[01:51:03.767 --> 01:51:05.888]  Final segment with Bernie.
[01:51:06.628 --> 01:51:14.171]  And by the way, 9 of midnight Central Standard Time, he is going to be live in studio here on the Genesis, on the satellites, everything.
[01:51:14.211 --> 01:51:17.212]  Stations out there, hot new live nighttime show.
[01:51:17.532 --> 01:51:18.553]  Hope you pick it up.
[01:51:18.673 --> 01:51:19.373]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:25.982]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[01:51:26.322 --> 01:51:32.664]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free, and can greatly benefit the health of the human body.
[01:51:33.425 --> 01:51:41.788]  By calling 908-691-2608 or visiting hempusa.org, you can benefit from this wonderful natural food source.
[01:51:42.428 --> 01:51:49.851]  Our customers are also purchasing this natural food for long-term storage, camping, survival and emergency food rations.
[01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:55.892]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org today.
[01:51:55.912 --> 01:52:03.836]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future and food will be your greatest asset.
[01:52:04.456 --> 01:52:11.279]  People spend money on all kinds of things, but our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[01:52:12.099 --> 01:52:14.060]  So don't delay, call today.
[01:52:17.546 --> 01:52:20.790]  And see what our powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[01:52:21.751 --> 01:52:23.152]  It is a big idea.
[01:52:23.172 --> 01:52:25.275]  A new world order.
[01:52:25.975 --> 01:52:30.721]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:52:30.881 --> 01:52:33.684]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:52:33.704 --> 01:52:35.967]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:52:36.487 --> 01:52:38.910]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:52:39.662 --> 01:52:46.996]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:52:50.003 --> 01:52:54.965]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:52:55.445 --> 01:52:58.927]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:52:59.307 --> 01:53:01.808]  The overburden is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:53:01.888 --> 01:53:03.029]  Most people have no idea.
[01:53:03.049 --> 01:53:03.829]  They're not after money.
[01:53:03.849 --> 01:53:04.909]  They have all the money they need.
[01:53:05.129 --> 01:53:05.830]  They're after power.
[01:53:06.110 --> 01:53:06.930]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:15.474]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:53:15.494 --> 01:53:18.255]  In Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:53:19.155 --> 01:53:19.956]  I've been warned.
[01:53:20.636 --> 01:53:26.362]  People around the world are testifying that their cataracts are quickly disappearing like magic thanks to Can-C.
[01:53:26.502 --> 01:53:36.371]  The original Can-C eye drop used in clinical trials maintains that only the original unadulterated formula is effective in reducing, reversing, and slowing the occurrence of senile cataract.
[01:53:36.491 --> 01:53:40.855]  Can-C can also assist in lowering the intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma.
[01:53:40.976 --> 01:53:44.599]  Can-C is beneficial for contact lens disorders, to treat corneal disorders,
[01:53:44.759 --> 01:53:45.159]  I'm good.
[01:54:14.879 --> 01:54:19.965]  You're sourced for the most powerful nutraceuticals and wellness protocols from a doctor you can trust.
[01:54:23.509 --> 01:54:27.773]  It seemed like yesterday, but it was long ago.
[01:54:28.634 --> 01:54:32.358]  She was lovely, she was the queen of our lives.
[01:54:32.779 --> 01:54:36.302]  There in the darkness with the radio playing low.
[01:54:43.714 --> 01:54:48.557]  I've got so much more!
[01:54:49.757 --> 01:54:51.058]  Deadlines!
[01:54:51.839 --> 01:54:54.000]  It's the Alex Jones Karaoke Show!
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:56.641]  Brought to you by Acoablue.com!
[01:54:57.682 --> 01:54:58.762]  Against the wind!
[01:55:00.043 --> 01:55:05.166]  Alright Burmess, you know the stock market
[01:55:07.048 --> 01:55:08.429]  Went below 7,000 today.
[01:55:08.469 --> 01:55:09.569]  It's now at 7,063.
[01:55:09.609 --> 01:55:11.190]  12-year low, right?
[01:55:12.251 --> 01:55:12.711]  Uh, no.
[01:55:12.791 --> 01:55:15.552]  That is, yes, 12-year low.
[01:55:15.612 --> 01:55:16.272]  Since 1997.
[01:55:18.473 --> 01:55:20.054]  Against the wind.
[01:55:20.074 --> 01:55:23.056]  Alright, I'm gonna stop it now.
[01:55:23.116 --> 01:55:23.776]  Hey, it's classic.
[01:55:23.816 --> 01:55:25.117]  It's hard not to sing along to it, right?
[01:55:25.217 --> 01:55:27.238]  I'd rather be doing, I'd rather be fishing right now with headphones on.
[01:55:29.275 --> 01:55:30.556]  It's a gorgeous day out too, right?
[01:55:30.576 --> 01:55:31.397]  But we've got to fight.
[01:55:31.617 --> 01:55:31.998]  We've got to battle.
[01:55:32.018 --> 01:55:33.299]  We've got to fight the New World Order.
[01:55:33.919 --> 01:55:41.605]  9 to midnight, you've got Gilbert Griffin on the night, going over the history of the New World Order, how it operates, how they control the left and right, the different round table grips.
[01:55:42.105 --> 01:55:42.986]  You've got him on for two hours?
[01:55:43.166 --> 01:55:46.048]  I believe I have him from 10 to 11 and then we're going to take calls in the final hour.
[01:55:46.088 --> 01:55:48.070]  First hour I'm going to try to go over the modern New World Order.
[01:55:48.510 --> 01:55:53.074]  We're going to show the Gordon Brown New World Order speech, just to get people associated with who this guy is.
[01:55:53.094 --> 01:56:03.404]  I think we're going to be seeing him in the news, especially in the United States, a lot in the next six months, as they restructure an overt globalist banker takeover, which I'm calling Obamanoid.
[01:56:03.504 --> 01:56:11.431]  As they said in the Trilateral Commission in the 70s, they would get us all in debt, implode the economy, and then there are the bankers that have the fiat currency for the whole world.
[01:56:12.572 --> 01:56:20.698]  I was looking at that Obama magazine that's out there on the stands and I didn't even realize, I mean this guy is the total front man, that this wasn't a Time magazine.
[01:56:20.938 --> 01:56:25.882]  It's set up like Time magazine, it looks exactly like Time magazine, except for where it says Time, it says Obama.
[01:56:26.542 --> 01:56:28.704]  And Aaron's like, take a look at this.
[01:56:28.824 --> 01:56:31.165]  And I look at it and right away I think it's Time magazine.
[01:56:31.185 --> 01:56:33.527]  Then I realize it has a $12 price tag.
[01:56:33.547 --> 01:56:34.528]  And I'm like, well what is this?
[01:56:34.568 --> 01:56:37.490]  And you open it up and it is just complete
[01:56:37.890 --> 01:56:38.790]  Propaganda.
[01:56:38.850 --> 01:56:40.551]  It is a total Obama litigation.
[01:56:40.571 --> 01:56:42.851]  No, no, folks, and they've never in U.S.
[01:56:42.891 --> 01:56:44.732]  history put this much propaganda behind somebody.
[01:56:44.752 --> 01:56:45.972]  They're planning terror attacks.
[01:56:46.332 --> 01:56:47.612]  You watch more wars.
[01:56:48.052 --> 01:56:57.575]  So they gotta get this group of zombies to do whatever he says so they can use that group of the American people as a weapon through his Obama Brigade, which they're openly set up under the Pentagon.
[01:56:57.615 --> 01:56:58.455]  It's now official.
[01:56:58.775 --> 01:56:59.395]  I think so.
[01:57:16.997 --> 01:57:20.118]  Listeners, you have to make this film go mega-viral.
[01:57:20.218 --> 01:57:24.160]  At PrisonPlanet.tv, March 15th, it'll be posted on high-quality burnished disc.
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:24.700]  Give it to folks.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:32.704]  Pre-order the high-quality DVD right now to make copies at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:57:32.744 --> 01:57:38.906]  That's 888-253-3139 or the ObamaDeception.net or ObamaDeception.net.
[01:57:38.926 --> 01:57:40.227]  That'll take you there as well.
[01:57:40.247 --> 01:57:42.408]  I mean, you've been seeing the film, you've been down there for a week and a half.
[01:57:42.628 --> 01:57:43.248]  What do you think of it?
[01:57:43.328 --> 01:57:44.929]  It looks amazing and, you know, this is the
[01:57:45.809 --> 01:57:51.235]  First film to really have a lot of HD news footage, as well as HD interviews that you guys shot.
[01:57:51.275 --> 01:57:56.200]  So this is probably, visually, the most high quality Prison Planet production out there yet.
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:58.402]  And it just looks totally and completely impressive.
[01:57:58.422 --> 01:58:02.727]  And we shot it in HD, but it won't be in total HD on the DVD, but it has the HD look.
[01:58:02.847 --> 01:58:03.448]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:58:03.488 --> 01:58:03.788]  Exactly.
[01:58:03.808 --> 01:58:08.233]  I mean, obviously you have to compress the DVD, but it really has a clean, clean, clean look.
[01:58:08.593 --> 01:58:11.116]  And Rob has really outdone himself with the editing.
[01:58:11.316 --> 01:58:13.478]  The special effects you've gotten for this thing look great.
[01:58:13.799 --> 01:58:14.680]  I'm in love with the cover.
[01:58:14.980 --> 01:58:18.243]  I think the girl that you got to do the cover, I think that's going to be an iconic image.
[01:58:18.283 --> 01:58:19.425]  I think that's going to be passed around.
[01:58:19.505 --> 01:58:22.428]  Just the cover is going to make people want to see this film.
[01:58:22.628 --> 01:58:26.371]  Well, folks haven't seen the official cover yet, but it's similar to the ObamaDeception.net website.
[01:58:41.024 --> 01:58:41.604]  How many hours?
[01:58:41.665 --> 01:58:42.845]  It's three to nine tonight.
[01:58:43.366 --> 01:58:46.368]  Mark your calendars for this evening with Burmy.
[01:58:46.949 --> 01:58:49.190]  And I'll probably be finishing on the mastering of the film.
[01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:51.412]  It's being sent off tomorrow to be mass-produced, so I'll be around.
[01:58:51.432 --> 01:58:54.914]  Maybe I'll pop in as well, but Burmus will be in this seat tonight.
[01:58:55.195 --> 01:58:57.597]  Retransmission starts at one place right now.
[01:58:57.617 --> 01:59:01.279]  InfoWars.com on the web and AMN.FM stations will be broadcasted later.
[01:59:01.319 --> 01:59:01.700]  God bless you.
[01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:03.741]  See you tomorrow.

[01:59:13.279 --> 01:59:17.901]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:59:18.021 --> 01:59:20.782]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:20.982 --> 01:59:23.843]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:24.023 --> 01:59:29.866]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:59:30.106 --> 01:59:33.048]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
