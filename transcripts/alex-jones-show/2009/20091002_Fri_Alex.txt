[00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:08.730]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.251]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:11.952]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.572 --> 00:00:16.214]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:20.816]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.678 --> 00:00:32.059]  All right, folks, we are back.
[00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.339]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:44.505]  I am Jason Bermas sitting in Alex on the ground in Hardin, Montana, where they've recently launched a privatized foreign mercenary service at a local prison there.
[00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:53.130]  And again, the guy they put at the head of it, multiple felon, 17 plus aliases, over a million dollars in lost civil suits.
[00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.335]  And he's calling himself Michael Hilton, but he has many, many aliases, and we are trying to find out who are his boss.
[00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:11.403]  Becky Shea, who's doing PR for them, refusing to discuss who the parent company is, but with your vigilant efforts, our listeners out there, I'm sure we will get the truth soon enough.
[00:01:11.823 --> 00:01:12.504]  Joining me now
[00:01:13.144 --> 00:01:14.105]  Is really a legend.
[00:01:14.565 --> 00:01:16.567]  Somebody I've been following for years and years and years.
[00:01:16.607 --> 00:01:18.789]  Somebody I followed even before Alex Jones.
[00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:24.134]  I came across him talking about his initial publication, The War Conspiracy.
[00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:25.595]  I believe that was back in 1972.
[00:01:27.057 --> 00:01:30.440]  He's an author, he's a poet, and in my mind, he's a genius.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.982]  Peter Dale Scott, how are you today, sir?
[00:01:33.062 --> 00:01:34.363]  I'm very happy to be here.
[00:01:35.464 --> 00:01:37.106]  You and your fine new studio.
[00:01:37.246 --> 00:01:38.227]  Well, thank you very much.
[00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:46.294]  Why don't you just give people that don't know who you are, who are not familiar with you, what your background is, what your work has been.
[00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:47.475]  I mean, you've done so much.
[00:01:47.515 --> 00:02:00.302]  You've done work on RFK, JFK, MLK assassinations, extensive work on the continuity of government programs, extensive work into deep politics in 9-11, just a huge body of work.
[00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:06.123]  Yes, well, actually, all this time until I retired, I was a professor of English.
[00:02:06.143 --> 00:02:09.145]  So the question is, why would I get into these other fields?
[00:02:09.646 --> 00:02:15.431]  The answer is that before that I was, I'm a Canadian and I was a diplomat for the Canadian government.
[00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:28.122]  And I had just enough exposure to Indochina in the 1950s to be a very early advocate that America should not make the mistake of the French and going to Vietnam.
[00:02:28.928 --> 00:02:51.286]  And then in researching what was wrong, the reasons why we shouldn't go into Vietnam, I became aware of Kennedy's decision to pull troops out, which was made in October of 63, and then reversed the weekend that he was killed by incoming President Johnson.
[00:02:51.386 --> 00:02:55.309]  And so that got me inevitably interested in the Kennedy assassination.
[00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:09.072]  And from all of that, I've just, you know, for those of you who are old enough to remember the 60s, it was a terrible decade because Bobby Kennedy was killed, Martin Luther King was killed.
[00:03:09.112 --> 00:03:11.933]  There were some other minor assassinations, too.
[00:03:12.813 --> 00:03:20.935]  And so I, at the time, used to talk about that my specialty was researching parapolitics.
[00:03:21.522 --> 00:03:28.268]  And now I usually use the term deep politics, which seems to be a term which will outlast me.
[00:03:28.348 --> 00:03:30.950]  I think people will continue to talk about it.
[00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.132]  And I have a book by that title.
[00:03:34.853 --> 00:03:48.105]  So that is, and I've continued to study it because I have my conviction that if you study all of these suppressed events, you find certain elements in common.
[00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.294]  By knowing more about the Kennedy assassination, it prepares you in a way to be able to study 9-11.
[00:03:56.494 --> 00:04:12.784]  I know that's an odd idea, but I have a book that's the revised issue, reissue of the war conspiracy lays out the case for saying that those two events have something in common.
[00:04:12.884 --> 00:04:14.225]  Is that back in publication?
[00:04:14.245 --> 00:04:15.986]  Yeah, there's a new edition.
[00:04:16.346 --> 00:04:19.448]  It's not the old book.
[00:04:19.528 --> 00:04:22.110]  This one actually talks about 9-11 and so on.
[00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.231]  It came out last year.
[00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:34.258]  If you Google for me, you'll get my website and then from there you'll see how to get the revised War Conspiracy.
[00:04:34.318 --> 00:04:39.321]  Wow, just a great interview coming up for you folks that are not familiar with Peter Dale Scott.
[00:04:39.361 --> 00:04:40.562]  Let me tell you, that was 1972.
[00:04:41.422 --> 00:04:45.865]  To put out a revised edition 36 plus years later is just excellent in my mind.
[00:04:45.925 --> 00:04:46.925]  I can't wait to check it out.
[00:04:47.185 --> 00:04:47.846]  We're going to come back.
[00:04:47.866 --> 00:04:49.627]  We're going to talk about the Obama administration.
[00:04:49.647 --> 00:04:51.268]  We're going to talk about the wars in the Middle East.
[00:04:51.548 --> 00:04:52.989]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:55.390]  He'll be coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:58.292]  PrisonPlanet.tv and TheWars.com
[00:04:59.724 --> 00:05:02.646]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:05:03.106 --> 00:05:06.287]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:05:06.728 --> 00:05:11.110]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.913]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[00:05:17.193 --> 00:05:21.676]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:05:21.957 --> 00:05:25.019]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:30.002]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:05:30.403 --> 00:05:36.707]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:05:36.967 --> 00:05:38.909]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.231]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:05:42.591 --> 00:05:46.654]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[00:05:47.095 --> 00:05:48.876]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:05:48.896 --> 00:05:49.236]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:05:49.256 --> 00:05:49.296]  877-327-0365.
[00:05:49.316 --> 00:05:49.857]  Don't wait.
[00:05:49.877 --> 00:05:50.317]  Call today.
[00:05:59.904 --> 00:06:07.372]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:06:07.652 --> 00:06:13.438]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[00:06:13.738 --> 00:06:16.401]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:06:16.681 --> 00:06:22.605]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:26.807]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:06:27.028 --> 00:06:32.391]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:06:32.651 --> 00:06:34.471]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:36.112]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:06:36.472 --> 00:06:38.732]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:06:39.012 --> 00:06:43.353]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:06:43.733 --> 00:06:47.114]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[00:06:47.434 --> 00:06:50.055]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:06:50.555 --> 00:06:51.975]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:06:52.455 --> 00:06:54.556]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:07:00.182 --> 00:07:02.785]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:07:03.185 --> 00:07:08.150]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.272]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:07:10.572 --> 00:07:15.397]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:07:15.577 --> 00:07:16.498]  How much do you want?
[00:07:16.738 --> 00:07:17.499]  When do you want it?
[00:07:17.859 --> 00:07:19.460]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.581]  When will you need it?
[00:07:20.821 --> 00:07:22.902]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:07:23.022 --> 00:07:24.143]  Will there be any food?
[00:07:24.363 --> 00:07:25.704]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:30.968]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:07:31.168 --> 00:07:34.350]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.213]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:07:38.553 --> 00:07:39.554]  How much will you need?
[00:07:39.794 --> 00:07:40.395]  We don't know.
[00:07:40.695 --> 00:07:41.596]  How much do you want?
[00:07:41.796 --> 00:07:42.536]  All you can get.
[00:07:42.716 --> 00:07:43.557]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:07:43.817 --> 00:07:46.580]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.240]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.042]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:49.062 --> 00:07:50.143]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:07:50.183 --> 00:07:53.105]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:08.962 --> 00:08:09.643]  We are back.
[00:08:09.703 --> 00:08:10.985]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:11.005 --> 00:08:13.047]  I'm joined by Peter Dale Scott in studio.
[00:08:13.067 --> 00:08:13.908]  A real treat for me.
[00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:17.652]  And during the break, we were just discussing this Michael Hilton character.
[00:08:18.213 --> 00:08:24.421]  And you were just discussing how you looked into the crest and how this was the crest of Montenegro.
[00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:26.223]  Well, actually, Serbia.
[00:08:26.243 --> 00:08:29.207]  Can the camera pick this up?
[00:08:29.307 --> 00:08:29.767]  Absolutely.
[00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:40.361]  This coat of arms was the coat of arms of the Obrenovic family, who were the rulers, the kings of Serbia down until 1903.
[00:08:42.247 --> 00:08:51.375]  When the last one was, I think, assassinated, and then you got the Karadjordjevichs, who were the kings up until World War II.
[00:08:51.955 --> 00:08:58.701]  The only surviving line of that family are the people who call themselves the Princes of Montenegro.
[00:08:59.342 --> 00:09:06.387]  And this George, this Hilton, Michael Hilton, was really Michael Djokovic, is apparently from Montenegro.
[00:09:07.108 --> 00:09:14.493]  So for some reason, you know, if you have it, that's an imperial double eagle, a sign of empire.
[00:09:14.513 --> 00:09:19.737]  And here is a king, it's a sign, the crown is a sign of monarchy.
[00:09:20.217 --> 00:09:25.521]  What's that doing on the side of a police car in Hardin, Montana?
[00:09:25.541 --> 00:09:27.122]  Which isn't really a police car.
[00:09:27.182 --> 00:09:29.364]  I mean, they're saying they're American police force.
[00:09:29.424 --> 00:09:30.545]  Well, they're not American.
[00:09:30.865 --> 00:09:32.226]  They're not a police force.
[00:09:32.706 --> 00:09:40.510]  And the guy heading this up is a multiple felon with over, yesterday it was a dozen aliases, now they're reporting 17 aliases plus.
[00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.032]  Did you ever see this coming in our country?
[00:09:43.052 --> 00:09:50.275]  Did you ever think we'd be at a time where prisons are set up, they're going to be run by foreign mercenaries, and they're going to be training foreign troops?
[00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:51.236]  It's nightmarish!
[00:09:51.736 --> 00:09:55.337]  And foreigners arresting Americans in America.
[00:09:56.017 --> 00:10:04.900]  And also the part of it that really scares me is the outsourcing of the job of spying on Americans.
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.081]  That's now being handled by private companies.
[00:10:08.201 --> 00:10:10.502]  I did an article about this recently.
[00:10:11.142 --> 00:10:13.822]  Science Applications and SAIC.
[00:10:17.144 --> 00:10:27.291]  They are composed of veterans of intelligence, but they're a private corporation with a contract to various departments of the U.S.
[00:10:27.351 --> 00:10:34.636]  government, and they've been assigned the job of correlating the job of spying on Americans.
[00:10:34.696 --> 00:10:39.539]  So there are these special stations set up all over America where
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:49.926]  Members of Army Counterintelligence sit in the same office with members of SAIC, private people, spying on us.
[00:10:50.926 --> 00:10:59.952]  I, you know, I went all through the Vietnam War and I knew my phone was tapped and I knew that my mail was, odd things happened to my mail.
[00:11:00.872 --> 00:11:05.076]  And it didn't particularly bother me, because I like this country.
[00:11:05.116 --> 00:11:06.677]  I'm not even an American.
[00:11:06.757 --> 00:11:09.159]  I'm a Canadian, but I like America.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:17.466]  And I sort of wanted them to know what I was doing, because I was not planning to put bombs anywhere, and I would prefer that they knew that.
[00:11:19.207 --> 00:11:22.350]  But I'm very uncomfortable that the job of
[00:11:23.843 --> 00:11:30.705]  Watching me is now being handed out to private corporations because they really have, you know, they have a profit motive.
[00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:44.889]  One of the things that went wrong in Iraq, this same company, SAIC, was given the job of finding out whether there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or not.
[00:11:45.129 --> 00:11:51.311]  And it was big business for them to report, yes, there is, because that meant more contracts and more money.
[00:11:52.131 --> 00:12:08.991]  And of course, this was one of the biggest intelligence fiascos of the last, well, 50 years probably, because we waged a whole war on the pretext of the weapons of mass destruction, which absolutely weren't there when they went to look for them.
[00:12:09.691 --> 00:12:19.375]  So, the Bush administration set up a committee to find out what went wrong, and they put all the SEIC people on the committee.
[00:12:19.736 --> 00:12:28.500]  So, obviously, they were unable to find, or they failed to report that SEIC had been a big part of the problem.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:37.884]  That's what's wrong with privatizing intelligence, because a profit motive is going to skew the intelligence, and the same thing with privatizing
[00:12:39.565 --> 00:12:48.113]  I don't know who was really responsible for stirring up trouble in Pittsburgh.
[00:12:48.213 --> 00:13:01.464]  I mean, time after time after time, you have peaceful protests which are then broken up in a violent way by the people whose nominal job is to prevent violence, but they have a stake
[00:13:02.425 --> 00:13:02.685]  I don't
[00:13:22.995 --> 00:13:28.779]  This is for the military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about on his exit from the presidency.
[00:13:28.819 --> 00:13:31.001]  This is them really coming into fruition.
[00:13:31.301 --> 00:13:35.364]  And you talked about private security firms spying on the American people.
[00:13:35.724 --> 00:13:51.236]  We know through the lawsuit, Hepting v. AT&T, that AT&T and other companies had secret rooms where they split off all the information, everything that went through a data cable, everything that went through your cell phone, was then hard-lined into a database.
[00:13:51.576 --> 00:14:01.361]  Now I'm not saying that that's all tracked through human eyes, but it is sent through systems like Carnivore and Promise, and they look for key words, key phrases.
[00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:03.903]  In essence, they're spying on the American people 24-7.
[00:14:04.003 --> 00:14:09.465]  And I wonder if anyone has really thought through the consequences.
[00:14:09.926 --> 00:14:15.569]  What happened in Pittsburgh is really very, very disturbing because it's like
[00:14:16.729 --> 00:14:20.831]  Serving notice to the American people that the age of peaceful protest is over.
[00:14:21.711 --> 00:14:28.794]  If you go to a peaceful demonstration, you risk losing your hearing from this LRAD, which is a monster.
[00:14:28.914 --> 00:14:38.437]  I mean, you know, in 1984, Orwell didn't have the imagination to foresee some of the things that we now have in place here.
[00:14:38.697 --> 00:14:43.479]  And, you know, I have very mainstream friends who were
[00:14:44.299 --> 00:14:52.265]  People who never protested in their lives but are extremely upset that this kind of... As you say, it's big business.
[00:14:53.145 --> 00:15:13.580]  And, you know, if people can't protest peacefully, well, I don't want to advise them what to do, but I would personally prefer that people protested peacefully than be driven to other forms of protest because peaceful protest is now past history in this country.
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.480]  Yeah, and I went down.
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.341]  I actually covered on the ground the Pittsburgh G20.
[00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:17.901]  I was there.
[00:15:18.161 --> 00:15:20.622]  They locked down all of downtown Pittsburgh.
[00:15:20.662 --> 00:15:22.362]  It was absolutely impossible to get there.
[00:15:22.402 --> 00:15:25.143]  They had Humvees with military forces.
[00:15:25.183 --> 00:15:26.403]  The National Guard came in.
[00:15:27.043 --> 00:15:29.124]  It was a $19 million project.
[00:15:29.564 --> 00:15:37.006]  I had covered every single one of the quote-unquote protests or out-of-control riots, and I had not seen the force that they used
[00:15:38.266 --> 00:15:38.406]  Yes.
[00:15:56.636 --> 00:16:15.668]  I don't want a rubber bullet in the eye you lose your hearing you know people are getting hit with tear gas canisters and LRAD weapons and I was threatened with arrest several times I was grabbed by one of the riot police I'm the only person there literally the protesters are a couple hundred feet away from me
[00:16:15.748 --> 00:16:16.149]  I don't know.
[00:16:32.268 --> 00:16:36.511]  He showed them the press pass and they said no and detained him anyway.
[00:16:36.631 --> 00:16:41.715]  And when we were calling to try to get these guys out they said no, there's a different process for protesters.
[00:16:41.775 --> 00:16:49.820]  Now this is the first time in this country that they detained over a hundred peaceful protesters, took their digital fingerprints and didn't charge them with anything.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:56.825]  It used to be in this country you had to be charged with a crime, they would take your fingerprints, but if you were found innocent of that crime you got that information back.
[00:16:57.105 --> 00:16:58.466]  These people weren't charged with anything.
[00:16:58.986 --> 00:16:59.526]  Right.
[00:16:59.627 --> 00:17:00.167]  It's unbelievable.
[00:17:00.187 --> 00:17:07.331]  They're obviously databasing the dissidents, you know, to try to quelch us from using our free speech.
[00:17:07.812 --> 00:17:08.912]  It's a deterrence thing.
[00:17:08.952 --> 00:17:16.157]  They want to say to people, you go out and be part of a peaceful protest and you don't know what's going to happen to you, so stay away.
[00:17:21.221 --> 00:17:23.223]  And I just don't see any opposition to it.
[00:17:23.243 --> 00:17:35.815]  And I didn't see, you know, the mainstream media are writing themselves into the history books by their refusal to face these big new issues that are coming up in this country.
[00:17:36.224 --> 00:17:39.586]  Absolutely, and you've been one who was very critical of the Bush administration.
[00:17:39.626 --> 00:17:42.408]  You've gone beyond the left and right paradigm.
[00:17:42.709 --> 00:17:46.772]  You know that this is, you know, one control group, one establishment.
[00:17:46.812 --> 00:17:50.094]  So you've been pretty critical of the Obama administration as well.
[00:17:50.374 --> 00:17:57.799]  I want to get into how they've really advanced the program, how they've advanced continuity of government, how they've advanced
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:05.187]  You know, presidential privileges and how, you know, this is and these are executive orders.
[00:18:05.247 --> 00:18:07.829]  This is not a government for and by the people anymore.
[00:18:07.869 --> 00:18:11.593]  We really don't have the system of checks and balances that this country was found on.
[00:18:11.613 --> 00:18:13.775]  That's why we have the three different branches of government.
[00:18:14.116 --> 00:18:16.879]  That's why, you know, Congress is supposed to have oversight.
[00:18:16.919 --> 00:18:18.520]  We don't see that anymore in this country.
[00:18:19.241 --> 00:18:34.197]  I think there's a crucial issue, which is, I hope everybody listening to this program knows, that for 20 years, Rumsfeld and Cheney were planning something called continuity of government measures.
[00:18:34.458 --> 00:18:38.061]  Originally, this was a quite legitimate activity.
[00:18:38.141 --> 00:18:40.784]  What happens if there's an atomic attack and
[00:18:41.845 --> 00:18:47.967]  Washington is hit by a nuclear weapon and we are decapitated.
[00:18:48.027 --> 00:18:49.768]  We don't have a government anymore.
[00:18:50.368 --> 00:19:00.352]  But Cheney and Rumsfeld changed it so it was planning to deal with any emergency and they got an executive order passed under Reagan which redefined
[00:19:01.472 --> 00:19:04.694]  The purpose of COG was to deal with any emergency.
[00:19:05.314 --> 00:19:13.018]  And the amazing thing is these two people went on planning for, in effect, the suspension of the American Constitution.
[00:19:13.058 --> 00:19:14.339]  That's what it's been called.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.201]  When neither of them were in the government.
[00:19:19.982 --> 00:19:21.604]  But they were in the continuity of government.
[00:19:21.664 --> 00:19:28.370]  They were in this special thing that was set up under Reagan back in 1981 by a secret order.
[00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:37.077]  And there's one biography of Rumsfeld that suggests that Clinton didn't even know what was going on.
[00:19:37.878 --> 00:19:45.525]  And the people who were planning it, originally they were Democrats and Republicans, but in the 90s they were all Republicans.
[00:19:45.965 --> 00:19:46.606]  Hold that thought.
[00:19:46.626 --> 00:19:48.207]  We're going to be back right after this.
[00:19:48.287 --> 00:19:54.631]  I do cover a lot of this in my film Fabled Enemies, the revamping of the continuity of government or shadow government program.
[00:19:54.691 --> 00:19:55.412]  Please check it out.
[00:19:55.472 --> 00:19:56.453]  It's the Alex Jones Show.

[00:19:57.814 --> 00:19:59.435]  We'll be back with Peter Dale Scott after this.
[00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:03.481]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.

[00:20:57.352 --> 00:21:03.115]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:03.515 --> 00:21:08.998]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:09.578 --> 00:21:10.058]  That's right.
[00:21:10.398 --> 00:21:12.679]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:20.163]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:20.723 --> 00:21:28.410]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:28.851 --> 00:21:33.715]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.

[00:21:47.008 --> 00:21:48.069]  It is a big idea.
[00:21:48.089 --> 00:21:49.010]  A new world order.
[00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:49.651]  In the near future.
[00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:09.464]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:22:09.764 --> 00:22:12.567]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:22:12.607 --> 00:22:14.850]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.833]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:22:18.573 --> 00:22:25.881]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:22:28.928 --> 00:22:33.891]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:22:34.351 --> 00:22:37.853]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:22:38.233 --> 00:22:40.714]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:22:40.794 --> 00:22:41.935]  Most people have no idea.
[00:22:41.955 --> 00:22:42.735]  They're not after money.
[00:22:42.755 --> 00:22:43.836]  They have all the money they need.
[00:22:44.036 --> 00:22:44.756]  They're after power.
[00:22:45.016 --> 00:22:45.857]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:24:09.133 --> 00:24:10.033]  We are back!
[00:24:10.394 --> 00:24:11.334]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:11.354 --> 00:24:12.495]  I am Jason Verma sitting in.
[00:24:12.555 --> 00:24:17.179]  Joining us in studio for PrisonPlanet.tv members is Peter Dale Scott.
[00:24:17.559 --> 00:24:21.622]  And we were just talking about this Continuity of Government program, which is the shadow government.
[00:24:21.923 --> 00:24:24.785]  Tell us how this integrates into the new Obama administration.
[00:24:24.885 --> 00:24:32.211]  Continuity of Government, COG, is a concept that every American should know about because it is a plan
[00:24:32.891 --> 00:24:37.592]  For it's supposed to be temporary suspension of the Constitution.
[00:24:38.493 --> 00:24:50.456]  And as I wrote in my book, The Road to 9-11, it was instituted for the first time on the morning, before 10 o'clock, on the morning of September the 11th, 2001, in response to these attacks.
[00:24:53.517 --> 00:25:08.491]  Now, that might have been an understandable response to an attack which they still didn't know the limits of, but that was codified into the declaration of a state of emergency three days later, on September the 14th.
[00:25:10.212 --> 00:25:14.874]  And there is a law which says that these things have to be renewed.
[00:25:15.214 --> 00:25:18.615]  And so Bush renewed it as late as the fall of 2008.
[00:25:19.215 --> 00:25:31.100]  And then I and another, Dan Hamburg, a former congressman, we started a campaign that Obama should end this once and for all.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.303]  And he let us down.
[00:25:35.363 --> 00:25:37.244]  He renewed it just this last month.
[00:25:37.364 --> 00:25:38.685]  He's renewed it again.
[00:25:38.705 --> 00:25:43.349]  And this is a plan, we don't even know what it means.
[00:25:43.649 --> 00:25:45.810]  Congressman DeFazio back in 2007,
[00:25:48.132 --> 00:26:03.185]  When he saw that Bush had, again, he was on the Homeland Security Committee, and he saw that there were certain secret orders, and he was on the Oversight Subcommittee that should have seen those orders, so he asked to see them.
[00:26:03.726 --> 00:26:09.551]  He was told that he didn't have the clearance to see them, because COG has its own clearances.
[00:26:10.091 --> 00:26:17.937]  This is why I think the report, the 9-11 report, certain things it just can't talk about.
[00:26:17.957 --> 00:26:28.604]  They can't find the certain orders because they were done at a higher level of clearance than they had to in order to write the report.
[00:26:29.205 --> 00:26:34.949]  Well, his whole committee wasn't able to see them, but there's another part of the law
[00:26:35.809 --> 00:26:54.743]  And I feel like a voice in the wilderness here because nobody's picked up on this, but it's right there in the law that if a state of emergency is declared, Congress must review it within six months and either ratify the state of emergency or close it down.
[00:26:55.403 --> 00:27:04.049]  So, as I say, this ex-Congressman Dan Hamburg and I said, well, Congress, you've had eight years now and you're supposed to do it in six months.
[00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:06.491]  So for heaven's sakes, do it!
[00:27:06.631 --> 00:27:10.634]  And we try to mobilize a campaign to get everyone to write to their congressman.
[00:27:11.374 --> 00:27:22.641]  And one congressman wrote back and said, well, that provision of the law is no longer operative because it has been overridden by guess what?
[00:27:22.741 --> 00:27:23.942]  Continuity of government.
[00:27:24.582 --> 00:27:30.546]  Well, this is the whole issue of, as you said, three branches of government and checks and balances.
[00:27:31.326 --> 00:27:50.961]  If a small group of people, two of whom are not even in the government, can set up a new set of rules which are brought in under the shadow of this attack on September the 11th, and Congress is told that they can't review it when the law says that they must review it,
[00:27:52.103 --> 00:28:02.825]  Uh, we have a disturbing situation, and when nobody in the media, I say there's the mainstream media, now we have the mainstream internet, too, and then we have people like you and me.
[00:28:02.845 --> 00:28:16.888]  Uh, the mainstream internet has not picked up on this, but this whole thing should be looked at, and Congress should, uh, first of all, should find out what secret rules are being put in.
[00:28:16.908 --> 00:28:19.789]  I mean, somebody in Congress should have the right to do that.
[00:28:20.709 --> 00:28:26.932]  This is, I think, a kind of line in the sand whether we're going to go on having a tripartite constitutional frame of government or not.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:49.923]  Well, unfortunately, the dumbed-down public thinks that the shadow government is nothing more than something you would see in a James Bond movie.
[00:28:49.943 --> 00:28:52.444]  They don't even know that it exists, Mr. Scott.
[00:28:52.524 --> 00:28:54.565]  I mean, that's just the reality.
[00:28:54.626 --> 00:28:56.286]  Well, I think they see more and more.
[00:28:56.366 --> 00:28:58.728]  They did what happened in Pittsburgh, for example.
[00:28:58.768 --> 00:29:02.189]  That's not the American way of doing things, you know.
[00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:10.173]  You have a small group of peaceful protesters and these companies have these brand new weapons they want to try out.
[00:29:12.154 --> 00:29:14.977]  And, uh, you know, members of the press getting arrested?
[00:29:15.978 --> 00:29:17.160]  No, I can't say arrested.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:17.800]  Detained.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:18.941]  He was not booked, right?
[00:29:18.981 --> 00:29:20.383]  Yeah, no, no, not booked at all.
[00:29:20.463 --> 00:29:26.009]  Just detained, um, so that they can see that things are changing.
[00:29:26.349 --> 00:29:26.870]  Absolutely.
[00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:32.133]  Alright, final segment coming up with Peter Dale Scott, one of the great minds of our time, folks.
[00:29:32.213 --> 00:29:35.335]  I can guarantee that his work will go down in history.
[00:29:35.455 --> 00:29:38.017]  Author of The War Conspiracy and much more.
[00:29:38.417 --> 00:29:39.377]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:39.457 --> 00:29:40.638]  I am Jason Burmas, sitting in.
[00:29:40.678 --> 00:29:41.579]  We'll be back after this.
[00:29:41.639 --> 00:29:44.100]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:50.424 --> 00:29:51.325]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.805 --> 00:29:53.326]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.338 --> 00:29:57.099]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.781]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:30:04.041 --> 00:30:05.841]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:30:06.041 --> 00:30:14.324]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:30:14.564 --> 00:30:19.785]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:30:20.105 --> 00:30:21.726]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:30:21.966 --> 00:30:28.308]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:30:28.488 --> 00:30:39.232]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:30:39.532 --> 00:30:40.052]  That's right.
[00:30:40.312 --> 00:30:42.613]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[00:30:47.034 --> 00:31:04.923]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:31:05.043 --> 00:31:06.983]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:31:07.124 --> 00:31:09.405]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:31:09.565 --> 00:31:11.426]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:31:11.846 --> 00:31:13.186]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:31:13.466 --> 00:31:14.507]  There is a solution.
[00:31:14.727 --> 00:31:22.753]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:31:57.796 --> 00:32:01.478]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:32:01.658 --> 00:32:03.118]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:32:03.399 --> 00:32:10.802]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:32:11.218 --> 00:32:14.060]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:30.311]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.

[00:33:03.106 --> 00:33:09.138]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:09.739 --> 00:33:12.705]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:29.915 --> 00:33:31.417]  Alright folks, we are back.
[00:33:31.477 --> 00:33:32.498]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:32.618 --> 00:33:34.660]  I'm Jason Burmas sitting here with Peter Dale Scott.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.224]  He's going to remain with us for a few more moments and then we're going to start taking your calls.
[00:33:39.416 --> 00:33:48.201]  Going over some of the mainstream news here, that again, foreign mercenary forces are in the United States under the guise of American police force.
[00:33:48.241 --> 00:33:51.482]  It's not American, it's not a police force.
[00:33:51.942 --> 00:34:00.367]  But we were just talking a little bit about COG and how that kind of intertwines into this government drug dealing, and we talked about Iran-Contra over the break.
[00:34:00.587 --> 00:34:06.390]  Why don't you tell people about Oliver North's revelations about continuity of government during Iran-Contra?
[00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:26.268]  Almost all that we know about continuity of government is actually goes back to the era when Congress, there was a congressional committee on Iran-Contra and Oliver North was a witness and a very good journalist, Alonzo Charty, wrote for the Miami
[00:34:30.291 --> 00:34:39.115]  Yes, for the Miami Herald, an article where he described it in some detail as a plan for the suspension of the Constitution.
[00:34:39.815 --> 00:34:48.480]  And Congressman Jack Brooks from Texas was on the committee and he asked Oliver North on camera, on television,
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:54.643]  Is it true that you have been working on plans to suspend the American Constitution?
[00:34:55.244 --> 00:34:57.365]  And the most amazing thing happened.
[00:34:57.485 --> 00:35:06.250]  The chairman of the committee, who was a Democrat, Senator Inouye, banged his gavel and said, oh, we can't go into that in an open session.
[00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:14.895]  We have to go into that in a secret session, thereby telling us all, in effect, that there was something there that was so
[00:35:15.936 --> 00:35:19.857]  Sensitive that the American people couldn't hear about it.
[00:35:20.678 --> 00:35:30.721]  And it was amazing that the New York Times had printed every word of the hearings and they printed that exchange.
[00:35:31.321 --> 00:35:35.463]  But they did a news story about what happened that day and didn't mention that.
[00:35:37.203 --> 00:35:49.255]  Oliver North, I mean the idea that Oliver North was doing something about suspending the American Constitution was not in the news story or any other mainstream media news story.
[00:35:49.536 --> 00:35:56.883]  That's where I really became, for the first time, aware of the increasing gap between what's going on at a deeper level.
[00:35:58.204 --> 00:36:04.268]  I call Iran-Contra a deep event, the Kennedy assassination a deep event, 9-11 a deep event.
[00:36:04.308 --> 00:36:11.393]  We're just getting used to the fact that every now and then something happens that we're not going to get to the bottom of.
[00:36:11.953 --> 00:36:19.799]  And what we have to be aware of is accumulatively these deep events are doing more to shape where the country is going.
[00:36:20.539 --> 00:36:26.461]  Then all the public debate that goes on in Congress, and that's particularly true of 9-11.
[00:36:26.581 --> 00:36:30.443]  We still haven't got to the bottom of it.
[00:36:30.643 --> 00:36:39.706]  Even the chairman of it had admitted that they didn't get proper information from the CIA.
[00:36:39.806 --> 00:36:48.809]  Louis Freeh, who was head of the FBI at the time, has said that it's perfectly understandable that people would want a new investigation.
[00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:55.053]  And yet, we're not going to get a new investigation because it's a deep event.
[00:36:55.654 --> 00:37:06.622]  But the most important constitutional event of this century to date has been the passing of COG on the morning of September 11, 2001.
[00:37:09.003 --> 00:37:12.225]  And it's barely reported anywhere.
[00:37:12.245 --> 00:37:18.568]  The 9-11 report says, yes, it happened, but we decided not to look into COG.
[00:37:18.588 --> 00:37:24.111]  They admit in their report that it did happen and that they didn't investigate it.
[00:37:24.781 --> 00:37:25.501]  It is shocking.
[00:37:25.541 --> 00:37:37.667]  Some other things that they've said, you know, Lee Hamilton and Thomas Kean did a book, Without Precedent, where they admitted that, you know, NORAD and the FAA just lied to them and they said it was so far from the truth, we don't know why they said what they did.
[00:37:37.687 --> 00:37:40.689]  I was actually one of the first people to get
[00:37:41.249 --> 00:37:52.694]  The NORAD tapes, which had been vetted, but you know, the first person to go through 30 plus hours of audio over, I think it was 21 separate channels, and you listen to these things and they're talking about drills going on.
[00:37:52.994 --> 00:37:55.315]  In fact, you know, in the movie Fabled Enemies, I go over it.
[00:37:55.595 --> 00:38:07.281]  They had to call in to Cheyenne Mountain 20 minutes after Flight 93 had been downed and ask them to take the inputs out of their screens, out of radar, because they were getting even more hijacked.
[00:38:07.321 --> 00:38:07.941]  Oh my God.
[00:38:08.001 --> 00:38:14.384]  Yeah, and I play the audio for you with them frantically calling into Cheyenne Mound, telling them to take the inputs off.
[00:38:14.804 --> 00:38:19.907]  And publicly, we know they were following Delta 1989, which supposedly had a bomb on board.
[00:38:20.227 --> 00:38:24.309]  They were following a Korean Airlines plane out of Alaska coming in.
[00:38:24.329 --> 00:38:26.590]  Oh, I know about that one, because it came down in Canada.
[00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:27.371]  Yes, that's right.
[00:38:27.391 --> 00:38:29.453]  It did come down in Canada before it was able to reach.
[00:38:41.647 --> 00:38:55.272]  You check the FBI's initial, I believe it's Team 8 or Team 7, they've now released some documents where they admit, and they give you the tail numbers, of not only the four hijacked planes, but four more that they thought were hijacked on the morning of 9-11.
[00:38:55.632 --> 00:39:06.717]  So we are so far from the truth on that very, very deep event, and it does warrant a new investigation, and I'm hoping that the people over at NYC CAN are able to win.
[00:39:07.977 --> 00:39:09.438]  Win their Supreme Court decision.
[00:39:09.478 --> 00:39:12.420]  Just getting it to the Supreme Court is almost a victory.
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.821]  And, you know, shining the light in the darkness.
[00:39:14.861 --> 00:39:17.242]  And that's what you've been able to do so well.
[00:39:17.562 --> 00:39:23.325]  You know, we're going to let you go because we've got an extensive interview to do later on for my upcoming film, Invisible Empire.
[00:39:23.365 --> 00:39:24.526]  Thank you so much for your time.
[00:39:24.666 --> 00:39:25.727]  Thank you, Jason.
[00:39:25.747 --> 00:39:27.588]  It was a great pleasure to actually see you.
[00:39:28.168 --> 00:39:28.848]  Just talk to you.
[00:39:29.048 --> 00:39:29.629]  Oh, excellent.
[00:39:29.649 --> 00:39:30.349]  Thank you so much.
[00:39:30.629 --> 00:39:35.292]  So we're going to go to your calls in just a moment, folks, but I want to thank the final sponsor of the day.
[00:39:36.152 --> 00:39:36.893]  Get up and go.
[00:39:36.913 --> 00:39:38.735]  I'm not going to force you to stay the other 10 minutes.
[00:39:39.636 --> 00:39:41.057]  FrontSight.com.
[00:39:41.097 --> 00:39:42.339]  That's FrontSight.com.
[00:39:42.559 --> 00:39:44.861]  S-I-G-H-T.com.
[00:39:44.901 --> 00:39:47.204]  You want to learn how to use your firearm.
[00:39:47.244 --> 00:39:48.846]  You want to be trained by the best.
[00:39:49.266 --> 00:39:51.228]  You got to go to FrontSight.com.
[00:39:51.268 --> 00:39:53.691]  They help make this program possible.
[00:39:55.014 --> 00:40:10.572]  You know just great people you know if you want if you want to use a firearm in the correct manner you know I was going through the news wires today this is just a side story I thought it was a great story but a five-year-old boy was able to shoot down in Texas by the way out of Houston an 800 pound alligator
[00:40:12.907 --> 00:40:18.332]  Now all you people that want to disarm the American public, if this child did not have a firearm, guess what?
[00:40:18.372 --> 00:40:20.774]  That 800-pound alligator probably would have eaten him.
[00:40:20.794 --> 00:40:23.036]  So there are many reasons to arm yourself.
[00:40:23.456 --> 00:40:24.857]  It's our Second Amendment right.
[00:40:25.237 --> 00:40:32.364]  And you know, Peter Dale Scott alluded to it, you know, when peaceful protest is gone in this country, what do we have left?
[00:40:33.104 --> 00:40:38.449]  Well, you know, Jack McLam out there will tell you, you know, we got the voting box and we've got the cartridge box.
[00:40:38.469 --> 00:40:42.413]  And I really, sincerely hope it never comes down to that cartridge box.
[00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:43.854]  All right, let's go to your calls.
[00:40:44.214 --> 00:40:45.195]  Stephen in Texas.
[00:40:45.215 --> 00:40:45.896]  Stephen, you're on the line.
[00:40:47.638 --> 00:40:48.098]  Yes, sir.
[00:40:48.138 --> 00:40:49.599]  Hey, good afternoon, Jason.
[00:40:49.619 --> 00:40:50.240]  Great show.
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:50.961]  Thank you.
[00:40:51.681 --> 00:40:56.085]  OK, first of all, a follow up on what I was telling you about yesterday.
[00:40:56.806 --> 00:40:58.788]  When I called out there to Hardin,
[00:40:59.443 --> 00:41:01.623]  I talked to a lady in City Hall.
[00:41:01.683 --> 00:41:24.108]  She said there wasn't anybody available from the City Council, but I specifically asked her, and this is one thing I really think needs to be pushed, because, okay, we're investigating who is this Michael Hilton, who's the parent company, all that, and that's all important, but I think the biggest issue, and this is what I asked her about, I said, I understand that this is a detention center.
[00:41:24.168 --> 00:41:27.229]  I said, who are they planning on detaining?
[00:41:28.254 --> 00:41:31.378]  Who are they going to have for detention?
[00:41:31.939 --> 00:41:34.202]  She would not answer my question.
[00:41:34.723 --> 00:41:38.848]  And now they're saying, no, this isn't a Guantanamo type deal.
[00:41:39.249 --> 00:41:39.890]  Well, they're right.
[00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:40.591]  It's not.
[00:41:41.132 --> 00:41:42.113]  It's for me and you.
[00:41:42.133 --> 00:41:43.535]  And if you think about it,
[00:41:44.195 --> 00:41:49.937]  You know, I thought it was really strange that Becky Shea actually took Alex inside the facility.
[00:41:49.957 --> 00:41:53.238]  You know, why would they do that when this is obviously a FEMA camp?
[00:41:53.398 --> 00:41:55.219]  I'll tell you what I believe personally.
[00:41:55.239 --> 00:42:00.661]  Number one, they try to quell the crowds and they're, you know, uproar about this.
[00:42:00.761 --> 00:42:06.663]  But I think secondly, this was a psych job that they were trying to do on Alex and you can ask them about this.
[00:42:07.063 --> 00:42:13.732]  Well, they're sending him a subtle message saying, Mr. Jones, welcome to what will ultimately be your home.
[00:42:15.154 --> 00:42:19.036]  Well, let's hope that that's not the case, but I do see where you could come to that conclusion.
[00:42:19.076 --> 00:42:27.361]  And I thought it was very bizarre that they had that sign about the hostages outside of the premises that we read earlier on the show today.
[00:42:27.941 --> 00:42:40.168]  If you saw the local news report, and we're going to be playing that in an upcoming segment along with the Pittsburgh video of them just gassing students who are on campus watching from a balcony.
[00:42:40.328 --> 00:42:42.069]  Believe it or not, I mean, it's there.
[00:42:42.089 --> 00:42:42.970]  We can't deny it.
[00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:55.675]  And I sincerely hope you're wrong, but when you have foreign mercenaries coming into this country who are multiple felons about to train other foreign mercenary and military groups, we have to ask these questions.
[00:42:55.935 --> 00:42:59.356]  And by the way, again, we have to find out about this Richard Culver fellow.
[00:42:59.736 --> 00:43:01.597]  Is he really Michael Hilton's boss?
[00:43:02.338 --> 00:43:06.201]  What has he done since he left as a colonel of the U.S.
[00:43:06.381 --> 00:43:06.641]  Army?
[00:43:06.721 --> 00:43:07.742]  What are his connections?
[00:43:08.022 --> 00:43:13.706]  Who owns American Police Force, which is neither American nor a police force?
[00:43:14.226 --> 00:43:17.429]  You know, the hole deepens, the mystery deepens, and we need answers.
[00:43:17.469 --> 00:43:18.670]  I thank you for the call, Stephen.
[00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:21.792]  As always, let's go to Betty in North Carolina.
[00:43:21.872 --> 00:43:22.653]  Betty, you're on the line.
[00:43:23.413 --> 00:43:24.134]  Hi, Jason.
[00:43:24.334 --> 00:43:25.434]  Glad to hear you again.
[00:43:25.795 --> 00:43:26.075]  Thank you.
[00:43:27.049 --> 00:43:29.390]  Um, I wanted to let you know three things.
[00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:35.251]  One, um, I'm getting the word out with the, uh, films I had bought.
[00:43:36.232 --> 00:43:39.352]  And my podiatrist, he's got four brothers that are doctors.
[00:43:39.733 --> 00:43:40.653]  They're getting them out.
[00:43:41.173 --> 00:43:44.014]  They've been getting reviews back from them, so that's neat.
[00:43:44.714 --> 00:43:48.875]  Secondly of all, I went yesterday to the heart clinic.
[00:43:49.415 --> 00:43:49.635]  Mm-hmm.
[00:43:49.695 --> 00:43:50.756]  To get my heart checked.
[00:43:51.256 --> 00:43:51.456]  Mm-hmm.
[00:43:51.476 --> 00:43:52.696]  And they have a scan there.
[00:43:53.616 --> 00:43:55.137]  I wasn't really paying attention.
[00:43:55.217 --> 00:43:56.097]  I was half asleep.
[00:43:56.968 --> 00:44:00.699]  The lady there told me to wash my hands with sanitizer.
[00:44:01.321 --> 00:44:04.371]  Place my right hand on this machine.
[00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:11.255]  Yeah, it's the new way that they take fingerprints and they database you.
[00:44:11.295 --> 00:44:12.576]  They did this to Rob Due.
[00:44:12.637 --> 00:44:16.781]  Again, no charges brought against him, a different process for protesters.
[00:44:17.161 --> 00:44:29.413]  It's the new digital way to get your biometric information and they're going to be doing this at your local health clinics, at your checkups, and of course by the police, military, and now these privatized security forces.
[00:44:29.993 --> 00:44:33.134]  You know, the control grid is ever encroaching, and it is here.
[00:44:33.194 --> 00:44:34.315]  I thank you for the call, Betty.
[00:44:34.575 --> 00:44:36.756]  Let's go to Wilson in Florida.
[00:44:36.796 --> 00:44:37.716]  Wilson, you're on the line.
[00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:40.457]  Good afternoon, Jason.
[00:44:40.977 --> 00:44:47.900]  I'm extremely delighted that you're filling in for Alex, because I love how you mix your intellect and humor at the same time.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:48.740]  Well, thank you.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:55.822]  I just wanted you to comment on me, because I was actually thinking about joining the National Guard, because I'm a college student.
[00:44:55.882 --> 00:44:56.943]  I just moved to Florida.
[00:44:57.734 --> 00:45:06.116]  It's hard for me because I'm thinking about joining the National Guard, but at the same time, I'm a devoted listener and follower of all the news that you guys report.
[00:45:07.917 --> 00:45:09.157]  I'm kind of conflicted on this.
[00:45:09.197 --> 00:45:12.238]  You know, we need good people like yourself in the military.
[00:45:12.358 --> 00:45:12.938]  Absolutely.
[00:45:12.998 --> 00:45:15.039]  And you can only help by being in the military.
[00:45:15.099 --> 00:45:19.820]  However, you know, I don't want to put you in a position, and I almost joined the National Guard before I woke up.
[00:45:20.141 --> 00:45:21.581]  I'd taken the ASFAB test.
[00:45:22.181 --> 00:45:24.642]  I went with my buddy who did join the National Guard.
[00:45:25.462 --> 00:45:43.708]  And you know he ended up being deployed into Iraq this is back in I believe 99-2000 and I was much like you you know I didn't have a lot of money I was going to college I'm like well you know it's a couple months a year and one weekend a month this is something that I can do it'll give me discipline it'll put me in better physical condition
[00:45:43.968 --> 00:45:54.498]  But is it really going to put us in better physical condition when they're mandating that you must take the H1N1 shot if you are indeed in the military, National Guard included?
[00:45:54.798 --> 00:46:02.145]  And now, you know, some military personnel had protested taking a mandatory anthrax shot and that was just shot down.
[00:46:02.185 --> 00:46:04.547]  That's about to go to the Supreme Court and I don't really have
[00:46:05.247 --> 00:46:16.191]  A lot of confidence that the Supreme Court is going to uphold an individual's freedom to say no to something that has, again, formaldehyde in it, squalene and mercury.
[00:46:16.251 --> 00:46:20.112]  So, Wilson, I would say pick up a crappy part-time job.
[00:46:20.232 --> 00:46:21.712]  I know it sucks flipping burgers.
[00:46:21.752 --> 00:46:23.733]  I was a pizza guy for almost a decade.
[00:46:24.193 --> 00:46:26.895]  Find something else, do yard work, anything else.
[00:46:27.035 --> 00:46:28.736]  Do not join the military, man.
[00:46:29.357 --> 00:46:31.358]  I just, I can't encourage people to do it.
[00:46:31.378 --> 00:46:35.521]  Again, we need good people in the military, but are you willing to put your health at risk?
[00:46:35.561 --> 00:46:37.462]  And you know, that's a soft kill weapon.
[00:46:37.682 --> 00:46:41.805]  They could very well send you overseas and you could get a bullet through your head in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:46:42.185 --> 00:46:45.367]  You've got to make the decision for yourself, but I wouldn't recommend it.
[00:46:45.427 --> 00:46:46.188]  Thank you so much.
[00:46:46.508 --> 00:46:48.629]  Let's go to Matt in California.
[00:46:48.689 --> 00:46:49.430]  Matt, you're on the line.
[00:46:50.854 --> 00:46:51.554]  Yes sir.
[00:46:51.735 --> 00:47:00.120]  Hi, I was just calling basically to see if you got to send out a message to gun rights activists and people who want to defend our second amendment across the country.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:06.503]  In California, I don't know if you guys are aware, there's a bill that's on the governor's desk right now, it's called AB 962.
[00:47:06.683 --> 00:47:11.766]  It's a mail order ammo ban for the state of California.
[00:47:11.987 --> 00:47:17.410]  And there's also another bill in the process that was put into legislation.
[00:47:18.386 --> 00:47:24.591]  In San Francisco, from a senator out there, and his name is Mark Lito.
[00:47:25.331 --> 00:47:42.904]  Well, I gotta tell you, I am not aware of that, but those seem like serious and real issues, so if you could get those bill numbers down and just a brief synopsis of what they're all about, links to the subsections that specifically talk about what you just said on air, please send them to rob at InfoWars.com, articles at InfoWars.com,
[00:47:43.564 --> 00:47:45.925]  Yes, getting back to a different subject matter.
[00:48:13.516 --> 00:48:20.580]  I would like to know what Russia's take on us going into Iran.
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.941]  It seems like it could spark up World War III.
[00:48:24.001 --> 00:48:25.702]  I mean, they don't want to see that at all.
[00:48:25.782 --> 00:48:31.585]  And I wish that Peter Dale Scott were here to answer that question as he's, you know, much more involved.
[00:48:32.306 --> 00:48:33.526]  Yeah, that's how it happened.
[00:48:33.886 --> 00:48:35.547]  Yeah, in these type of politics.
[00:48:35.587 --> 00:48:36.848]  However, you know, I can say this.
[00:48:38.021 --> 00:49:01.461]  The mainstream media continues to put out the myth that Russia attacked Georgia over a year ago, Russia's this evil giant, Russia's the new enemy, when even the EU, which is a globalist organization, the European Union is basically one of these globalist wet dreams that has occurred, this consolidation of power, this move towards world government, and even their investigation
[00:49:01.941 --> 00:49:02.261]  All right.
[00:49:17.393 --> 00:49:18.494]  Let's go to Nick in New York.
[00:49:18.514 --> 00:49:19.274]  Nick, you're on the line.
[00:49:46.092 --> 00:49:47.252]  Yes, good afternoon, sir.
[00:49:47.833 --> 00:49:48.373]  Good afternoon.
[00:49:48.973 --> 00:49:51.274]  I just got three simple questions, if you may.
[00:49:51.734 --> 00:49:52.094]  Okay.
[00:49:52.334 --> 00:49:55.035]  One, where is the governor of Montana?
[00:49:55.955 --> 00:49:56.795]  That's a good question.
[00:49:56.835 --> 00:49:57.915]  I don't think he's weighed in.
[00:49:58.176 --> 00:50:00.056]  You know, the attorney general has now weighed in.
[00:50:00.096 --> 00:50:01.717]  They say that they're going to do a probe.
[00:50:01.997 --> 00:50:04.097]  I'm not sure anybody's called the governor's office.
[00:50:04.137 --> 00:50:05.518]  I would encourage people to do so.
[00:50:05.558 --> 00:50:06.078]  Go ahead, Nick.
[00:50:06.818 --> 00:50:10.039]  Second one, where is the local county sheriff?
[00:50:10.677 --> 00:50:11.717]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:50:11.757 --> 00:50:14.219]  They're trying to disband the Sheriff's Department.
[00:50:14.639 --> 00:50:23.102]  I don't know where the local county sheriff is, but they have been trying to get rid of them because they say that they're unnecessary, the town is small.
[00:50:23.162 --> 00:50:25.403]  Like Alex said, it's black in most of the town.
[00:50:26.164 --> 00:50:27.905]  You know, there's not a lot of lights around.
[00:50:27.945 --> 00:50:30.306]  It's not like this is a 24-7 running city.
[00:50:30.326 --> 00:50:32.627]  This is a small, small area.
[00:50:32.667 --> 00:50:33.587]  What's the third question?
[00:50:34.407 --> 00:50:39.950]  The third question is, I just don't understand how
[00:50:42.842 --> 00:50:46.085]  Well, that's how you get rid of them, Nick.
[00:50:46.125 --> 00:50:49.027]  You just say that they don't exist and we need a privatized police force.
[00:50:49.067 --> 00:50:51.009]  Unfortunately, again, this is the new America.
[00:50:51.029 --> 00:50:51.830]  I thank you for the call.
[00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:52.771]  More calls after this.
[00:50:52.831 --> 00:50:53.791]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:54.152 --> 00:50:57.374]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting in PrisonPlanet.TV, InfoWars.com.
[00:51:05.708 --> 00:51:06.128]  We're good to go.
[00:51:21.144 --> 00:51:26.186]  Powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.
[00:51:26.466 --> 00:51:30.967]  From the smallest to the largest systems, Big Berkey Water Filters dot com has what you need.
[00:51:31.308 --> 00:51:37.490]  With your system purchase, you'll receive a shower filter, a fluoride filter, or two sport Berkey bottles absolutely free.
[00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:47.213]  Big Berkey Water Filters dot com would like to offer GCN listeners 5% off all ceramic filter systems and ship all orders over $50 free of charge.
[00:51:47.513 --> 00:51:49.754]  Visit Big Berkey Water Filters dot com.
[00:51:50.054 --> 00:51:55.019]  That's big Berkey water filters dot com or call 1 8 7 7 9 9 Berkey.
[00:51:55.199 --> 00:51:59.543]  That's 1 8 7 7 9 9 b e r k e y today.
[00:51:59.983 --> 00:52:07.730]  When looking at your personal preparedness level, remember the freeze dry guy during times of physical and emotional stress like the uncertain times we live in today.
[00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:10.673]  It is vital that you not alter your diet too much.
[00:52:10.893 --> 00:52:12.815]  You should only store what you usually eat.
[00:52:13.055 --> 00:52:15.916]  Because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored.
[00:52:16.196 --> 00:52:18.116]  Lucky for you, there's the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[00:52:18.276 --> 00:52:24.558]  Featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect, the Freeze-Dry Guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods.
[00:52:24.738 --> 00:52:29.519]  All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time.
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:37.922]  The Freeze-Dry Guy has been serving various government agencies as well as the private sector with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[00:52:39.022 --> 00:52:45.729]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today.
[00:52:45.909 --> 00:52:50.714]  Comparably, the advances made in food storage from the World War II era till now are equally great.
[00:52:50.915 --> 00:52:55.700]  Visit the website at www.freezedryguy.com or call toll-free 866-404-3663.
[00:53:03.436 --> 00:53:06.598]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:53:06.939 --> 00:53:08.880]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:16.926]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:53:17.586 --> 00:53:24.632]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:53:25.052 --> 00:53:31.877]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:53:32.429 --> 00:53:36.511]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:53:36.771 --> 00:53:40.312]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:53:40.732 --> 00:53:42.673]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:53:42.993 --> 00:53:46.915]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:53:47.435 --> 00:53:54.438]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:59.926 --> 00:54:00.226]  I'm good.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:10.520]  We are back.
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:12.341]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:38.823 --> 00:54:41.604]  Words are ringing true on the bumper music, unfortunately, folks.
[00:54:41.624 --> 00:54:49.147]  I want to remind everybody that Fall of the Republic, the presidency of Barack Obama, drops October 21st.
[00:54:49.187 --> 00:54:53.629]  You can pre-order it now at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[00:54:53.669 --> 00:54:58.171]  It's got a ton of bonus features, including Oath Keepers and Charlie Sheen's message to the President.
[00:54:58.551 --> 00:55:01.553]  Fall of the Republic documents how an offshore corporate cartel is
[00:55:02.233 --> 00:55:03.294]  Bankrupting the U.S.
[00:55:03.334 --> 00:55:04.555]  economy by design.
[00:55:04.835 --> 00:55:10.819]  Leaders are now declaring that world government has arrived and that the dollar will be replaced with a new global currency.
[00:55:10.859 --> 00:55:14.602]  And we discussed the SDR unit earlier in the program.
[00:55:15.422 --> 00:55:16.243]  Folks, go get it now.
[00:55:16.643 --> 00:55:17.444]  Pre-order it today.
[00:55:17.464 --> 00:55:21.987]  You'll be the first to get Barack Obama Fall of the Republic.
[00:55:23.507 --> 00:55:25.008]  All right, we're going to continue with your calls.
[00:55:25.028 --> 00:55:27.129]  We're going to take calls all next hour.
[00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:36.174]  If you want to talk about this Michael Hilton character, if you want to talk about the police state, if you want to talk about the H1N1 vaccinations, now's the time to call in.
[00:55:36.214 --> 00:55:37.375]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:55:37.495 --> 00:55:41.957]  Alex is going to be joining us in the last 20 minutes of the program.
[00:55:42.517 --> 00:55:45.399]  Let's go to our next caller, Richard in New York.
[00:55:45.499 --> 00:55:46.299]  Richard, you're on the line.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:48.801]  Yes, Jason.
[00:55:48.841 --> 00:55:49.121]  Yes, sir.
[00:55:49.521 --> 00:55:49.721]  Yes.
[00:55:50.682 --> 00:55:52.823]  My name is Richard Kurt.
[00:55:54.188 --> 00:55:55.448]  I am a journalist.
[00:55:57.029 --> 00:56:03.930]  I understand that you may have some career opportunities at present planet.
[00:56:05.331 --> 00:56:12.973]  You know, I'm not sure who we're hiring, Richard, but you'd have to check in with like articles at InfoWars or writers at InfoWars and check that out.
[00:56:13.013 --> 00:56:14.033]  Show tips at InfoWars.
[00:56:14.053 --> 00:56:16.073]  I don't handle any of the hirings.
[00:56:16.093 --> 00:56:17.354]  You know, I sit here.
[00:56:17.414 --> 00:56:18.234]  I do my own thing.
[00:56:18.294 --> 00:56:20.174]  I'm working on a movie most of the time.
[00:56:20.234 --> 00:56:21.875]  I do the weekly radio broadcast.
[00:56:21.955 --> 00:56:22.795]  I sub in for Alex.
[00:56:23.595 --> 00:56:32.100]  I go on the scene of many of these organizations, but I do know that if you start submitting articles to writers and articles, you know, that's how Curt Nemo got started.
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:37.643]  And Curt Nemo, obviously, one of the premier writers for InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[00:56:37.683 --> 00:56:38.884]  I appreciate the interest.
[00:56:39.264 --> 00:56:41.505]  Let's go to Robert in California.
[00:56:41.565 --> 00:56:42.405]  Robert, you're online.
[00:56:44.026 --> 00:56:44.346]  Yes, sir.
[00:56:44.447 --> 00:56:49.489]  Jason, I want to tell you what a great job you did last night and a great job today.
[00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:50.670]  Thank you so much.
[00:56:51.328 --> 00:56:54.811]  But let me confirm exactly what you and Alex were saying.
[00:56:54.831 --> 00:57:03.138]  I want to say that I have a friend, I'm not going to get into detail, but his spouse is in the Department of Immigration.
[00:57:03.578 --> 00:57:07.061]  And she's a higher up in the Department of Immigration in Washington, D.C.
[00:57:08.042 --> 00:57:18.731]  And she told him, because I called him today to warn him not to take the shots, and I told him about the mercenary camp, and he told me that his girlfriend
[00:57:19.921 --> 00:57:31.449]  Has seen that they are giving citizenship to foreign mercenary soldiers fighting alongside the troops in Afghanistan and in Iraq, my friend.
[00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:41.876]  It confirms exactly what you and Alex Jones have been saying at huge numbers where she is looking at it and seeing that it's disturbing her and she works for the government.
[00:57:42.383 --> 00:57:44.464]  Well, it's in the thousands, no doubt.
[00:57:44.524 --> 00:57:47.966]  And remember, foreign troops on U.S.
[00:57:47.986 --> 00:57:51.588]  streets will be more apt to round out American citizens.
[00:57:51.648 --> 00:57:55.690]  They will be more apt to use violent force against American citizens.
[00:57:55.910 --> 00:58:02.514]  They will be less apt to rise up against the state because they look at this as their meal ticket, their way to a better life.
[00:58:02.874 --> 00:58:03.995]  So they won't care.
[00:58:04.315 --> 00:58:08.217]  I mean, I don't understand how people cannot get the fact
[00:58:08.757 --> 00:58:24.328]  That it is bad news to have a foreign mercenary criminal, I mean this guy Hilton, with 17 plus aliases, running a privatized detention center that's going to be training other foreign mercenaries and troops.
[00:58:25.169 --> 00:58:26.710]  Again, it's the end of America.
[00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:27.850]  It's mind-blowing.
[00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:29.872]  It's hard for me to understand.
[00:58:30.072 --> 00:58:31.353]  It's hard for me to conceive.
[00:58:31.553 --> 00:58:32.794]  Yet it's right in front of my face.
[00:58:32.834 --> 00:58:33.714]  We'll be back after this.
[00:58:33.775 --> 00:58:34.735]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:34.995 --> 00:58:35.656]  Take in your calls.
[00:58:42.273 --> 00:58:43.795]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.755 --> 00:58:47.118]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.543]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:58:53.003 --> 00:58:56.167]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:58:56.627 --> 00:59:00.991]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[00:59:01.191 --> 00:59:06.797]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[00:59:07.077 --> 00:59:11.559]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:14.881]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:59:15.462 --> 00:59:19.864]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:59:20.264 --> 00:59:26.568]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:59:26.848 --> 00:59:28.789]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[00:59:29.269 --> 00:59:32.089]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:36.530]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[00:59:36.970 --> 00:59:38.671]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:59:38.691 --> 00:59:39.111]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:59:39.131 --> 00:59:39.191]  877-327-0365.
[00:59:39.211 --> 00:59:39.691]  Don't wait.
[00:59:39.751 --> 00:59:40.291]  Call today.
[00:59:40.371 --> 00:59:41.391]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:41.471 --> 00:59:42.631]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:11.783]  Streaming live from PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:11.923 --> 01:00:20.447]  Alex set to join us in the final 20 minutes of this hour with a report from Hardin, Montana on the ground.
[01:00:21.485 --> 01:00:26.931]  Getting as much intel, as much information as he possibly can as this story breaks nationwide.
[01:00:27.372 --> 01:00:42.849]  And this is a call to all the people out there that have not lost their souls, that have not lost their humanity, that have not lost the ability to love one another, to care for one another, to look out for one another, to take action today, to decide this is the day you change your life.
[01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:49.333]  To get this information out to your mother, your father, your brother, your sister, your neighbor, your friends.
[01:00:50.414 --> 01:01:01.761]  It is so vital, so important that we stop this right now before this program expands from Montana into California, into New York, into Chicago.
[01:01:02.694 --> 01:01:05.755]  Where some of the leaders are now saying, you know, the streets are just too dangerous.
[01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:06.756]  We need martial law.
[01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:14.859]  We had the Schenectady mayor trying to say the crime was so bad there they were going to disband the police department and bring in the military for martial law.
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:20.322]  I can promise you folks, martial law is not what this country was founded on.
[01:01:20.882 --> 01:01:23.943]  Martial law is not the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:01:24.944 --> 01:01:29.306]  Martial law does not involve a free populace.
[01:01:30.386 --> 01:01:31.607]  Martial law is tyranny.
[01:01:32.524 --> 01:01:34.109]  Martial law is a nightmare.
[01:01:34.831 --> 01:01:39.125]  And these are the steps towards martial law when you bring in foreign mercenary forces.
[01:01:39.855 --> 01:01:45.596]  Who are under the direction of private corporations who remain as of yet unnamed.
[01:01:45.636 --> 01:01:48.477]  And that is the reality we are dealing with today.
[01:01:49.117 --> 01:01:49.517]  Today.
[01:01:50.017 --> 01:01:51.038]  This isn't in the future.
[01:01:51.558 --> 01:01:52.338]  This is now.
[01:01:53.018 --> 01:01:55.999]  So please stand up for what is good in this world.
[01:01:56.039 --> 01:01:56.759]  For what is right.
[01:01:57.459 --> 01:01:59.900]  For that baby in the crib in the other room.
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.481]  For your son or daughter who's off to kindergarten.
[01:02:05.041 --> 01:02:08.762]  For your teenager about to graduate high school and move on to college.
[01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:11.326]  There is so much to live for.
[01:02:11.386 --> 01:02:13.807]  There's so much that is still good in this country.
[01:02:14.087 --> 01:02:15.247]  We can work together.
[01:02:15.327 --> 01:02:16.908]  We can save this country.
[01:02:17.888 --> 01:02:18.608]  If we want to.
[01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:20.489]  If we decide to take action.
[01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:23.369]  If we decide that we have great power within ourselves.
[01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:25.570]  Alright, let's continue with the calls.
[01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:27.770]  Let's go to Lou in Massachusetts.
[01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:28.550]  Lou, you're online.
[01:02:30.231 --> 01:02:30.551]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:31.471 --> 01:02:31.891]  Hi, Jason.
[01:02:32.351 --> 01:02:34.652]  I've got some information.
[01:02:35.709 --> 01:02:39.091]  About the Richard Culver character.
[01:02:39.111 --> 01:02:40.252]  Let's hear it.
[01:02:41.013 --> 01:02:49.278]  I just did some basic internet searches and it looks like he is a director for a company called International S.O.S.
[01:02:49.739 --> 01:02:58.825]  that what they do is they basically, it looks like for like $150 a month you can get yourself a little insurance policy, quote unquote.
[01:02:59.693 --> 01:02:59.773]  He's
[01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:22.730]  Let's go to Mona in Montana.
[01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:23.430]  Mona, you're on the line.
[01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:24.171]  Hey Jason, how are you?
[01:03:52.141 --> 01:03:53.321]  Listen, I'm from Montana.
[01:03:53.441 --> 01:03:54.642]  I've got information for you.
[01:03:54.882 --> 01:03:57.463]  We actually took a trip to Hardin, Montana two days ago.
[01:03:57.483 --> 01:03:58.243]  Okay.
[01:03:58.263 --> 01:04:01.064]  We're about a six and a half hour drive from where we are.
[01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:02.684]  That's great dedication, ma'am.
[01:04:03.444 --> 01:04:06.965]  And we're politically active here 24-7.
[01:04:07.025 --> 01:04:19.709]  So I wanted to let you know that we actually went to the City Hall and tried to get copies of the meeting minutes from September 15th from the City Council.
[01:04:20.459 --> 01:04:20.759]  I don't know.
[01:04:42.041 --> 01:04:50.985]  Hold over Mona, I want to find out what happened, what was in these documents.
[01:04:51.025 --> 01:04:52.385]  We appreciate your vigilance.
[01:04:52.405 --> 01:04:55.046]  We'll be back with Mona, Ryan, Stuart, Michael and more.
[01:04:55.106 --> 01:04:56.066]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:56.146 --> 01:04:57.367]  I am Jason Burma sitting in.
[01:04:57.427 --> 01:04:59.028]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:00.305 --> 01:05:02.907]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:03.307 --> 01:05:08.291]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:08.651 --> 01:05:10.372]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:10.693 --> 01:05:15.516]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:15.696 --> 01:05:16.617]  How much do you want?
[01:05:16.857 --> 01:05:17.617]  When do you want it?
[01:05:17.998 --> 01:05:19.599]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:05:19.879 --> 01:05:20.699]  When will you need it?
[01:05:20.939 --> 01:05:23.020]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:24.261]  Will there be any food?
[01:05:24.481 --> 01:05:25.822]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:31.085]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:05:31.285 --> 01:05:34.467]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:05:34.867 --> 01:05:38.329]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:05:38.689 --> 01:05:39.669]  How much will you need?
[01:05:39.909 --> 01:05:40.509]  We don't know.
[01:05:40.810 --> 01:05:41.710]  How much do you want?
[01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:42.650]  All you can get.
[01:05:42.850 --> 01:05:43.690]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:46.711]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:05:46.991 --> 01:05:49.172]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:49.192 --> 01:05:50.192]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:05:59.335 --> 01:06:04.522]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:06:04.642 --> 01:06:09.008]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:06:09.168 --> 01:06:11.031]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:06:11.451 --> 01:06:12.793]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:06:13.073 --> 01:06:14.115]  There is a solution.
[01:06:14.335 --> 01:06:22.357]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:06:22.757 --> 01:06:29.839]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[01:06:36.261 --> 01:06:41.822]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:06:42.262 --> 01:06:46.065]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:06:46.405 --> 01:06:50.768]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.

[01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:02.090]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:02.991]  Spy on me?
[01:07:03.111 --> 01:07:03.371]  Yeah.
[01:07:03.431 --> 01:07:08.335]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[01:07:08.475 --> 01:07:09.936]  You should use StartPage instead.
[01:07:10.096 --> 01:07:10.756]  StartPage?
[01:07:10.836 --> 01:07:12.257]  Yeah, StartPage.com.
[01:07:12.357 --> 01:07:15.159]  The new name for XQuick, the world's most private search engine.
[01:07:15.319 --> 01:07:19.042]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:22.104]  Plus, StartPage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[01:07:22.324 --> 01:07:24.685]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[01:07:24.926 --> 01:07:26.447]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[01:07:26.547 --> 01:07:26.767]  Right.
[01:07:26.847 --> 01:07:29.829]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:31.690]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:32.070 --> 01:07:35.572]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[01:07:35.912 --> 01:07:39.553]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage Challenge.
[01:07:39.713 --> 01:07:44.676]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[01:07:44.856 --> 01:07:47.817]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the big brother habit.
[01:07:48.257 --> 01:07:49.818]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[01:07:50.018 --> 01:07:53.920]  Try StartPage.com for seven days and start protecting your privacy.
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:55.881]  That's StartPage.com.
[01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:05.293]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:05.654 --> 01:08:07.939]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:10.188 --> 01:08:11.509]  We are back live.
[01:08:12.189 --> 01:08:16.111]  Folks, if you've missed any of the program, such an important, informative program.
[01:08:16.231 --> 01:08:19.032]  Alex Jones reporting live from Hardin, Montana.
[01:08:19.092 --> 01:08:21.033]  I am Jason Bermas sitting in.
[01:08:21.073 --> 01:08:23.694]  He's going to be joining us in the last 20 minutes of the program.
[01:08:23.714 --> 01:08:27.336]  We had Peter Dale Scott in studio, a discussion with Bob Chapman.
[01:08:27.696 --> 01:08:36.000]  If you missed any of it, you can get the podcast after the program or the rebroadcast begins at InfoWars.com as soon as the regular show ends.
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:43.525]  We're going to continue with the phone calls and we were talking to Mona in Montana who drove six hours with a partner of hers.
[01:08:44.245 --> 01:08:46.246]  They tried to go into the city council meeting.
[01:08:46.326 --> 01:08:47.367]  They tried to get documents.
[01:08:47.427 --> 01:08:49.508]  At first they said, no, you can't have these documents.
[01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:51.350]  He pulled out his state constitution.
[01:08:51.370 --> 01:08:52.910]  You were able to get these documents.
[01:08:53.011 --> 01:08:53.731]  What did they entail?
[01:08:55.092 --> 01:09:02.897]  Well, the documents that we did get are the minutes of the previous meeting from September 5th and 15th regarding the economic development
[01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:07.495]  Mona, we need to see what's on these things.
[01:09:07.515 --> 01:09:11.176]  Do you have access to a scanner or a fax machine?
[01:09:27.327 --> 01:09:27.647]  I do.
[01:09:27.927 --> 01:09:28.268]  I do.
[01:09:28.888 --> 01:09:29.688]  Can we give out the facts?
[01:09:29.708 --> 01:09:32.810]  Can we hold her over, John, and give her the facts information?
[01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:42.075]  And we will have you fax that out and email the information because it is so vital we see what was actually discussed at these meetings and put on paper.
[01:09:42.336 --> 01:09:44.237]  Just go over a few things for us right now.
[01:09:45.157 --> 01:09:45.517]  Okay.
[01:09:45.958 --> 01:09:47.959]  Let me just give you a couple highlights here.
[01:09:49.239 --> 01:09:53.322]  What I think is important to mention here, it says that, let's see.
[01:09:54.218 --> 01:10:00.704]  The Two Rivers Authority, and the contract was signed by officials representing Two Rivers Authority and the American Police Force.
[01:10:01.445 --> 01:10:20.702]  He explained to the crowd that the APF, now he being Al Peterson, who is the Vice President of TRA, consists of retired and ex-police slash military personnel, including ex-SEALs, Rangers, etc., who have been trained and have experience in everything from airline slash cruise ship security to hostage negotiation.
[01:10:21.414 --> 01:10:24.476]  The APF chose Hardin because they are impressed with the community.
[01:10:24.996 --> 01:10:25.276]  Uh-huh.
[01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:29.378]  They have been in Hardin for the last nine months and the community has welcomed them and treated them well.
[01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:46.987]  Okay, in the contract signed, it says the APF will only house low to medium security inmates and only the chief of police, the United States government, Montana Department of Corrections, and the state, local, county, and federal jurisdictions will be allowed to place only properly classified inmates in the facility.
[01:10:47.007 --> 01:10:47.888]  Interesting.
[01:10:49.212 --> 01:10:49.633]  We're good to go.
[01:11:08.667 --> 01:11:08.927]  Uh, okay.
[01:11:09.328 --> 01:11:14.470]  Al stated that the only money APF would be making will be from inmate phone calls and stuff like that.
[01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:16.691]  Oh, please.
[01:11:17.151 --> 01:11:18.491]  They will be paying T.R.A.
[01:11:18.511 --> 01:11:23.793]  $5 per inmate per day, as well as all taxes, etc.
[01:11:24.254 --> 01:11:30.076]  APF will pay any deficiency to trust starting February 1st, 2010, regardless of whether they have inmates or not.
[01:11:30.816 --> 01:11:32.657]  They will pay the money to T.R.A., then T.R.A.
[01:11:32.677 --> 01:11:33.337]  will make the payments.
[01:11:33.437 --> 01:11:34.738]  The contract also mentions that
[01:11:35.154 --> 01:11:41.319]  The contract also states that APF will shop in the community first for the things they need before heading out of town.
[01:11:41.339 --> 01:11:43.981]  APF wants to help them become a part of this community
[01:12:04.608 --> 01:12:09.430]  And they're willing to send a police officer with food to the houses of people who are not able to get out and about.
[01:12:12.711 --> 01:12:13.711]  Mona, hold back.
[01:12:14.072 --> 01:12:14.552]  Get a pen.
[01:12:14.632 --> 01:12:16.392]  I'm going to give you the fax number right now.
[01:12:16.733 --> 01:12:17.653]  You tell me when you're ready.
[01:12:18.353 --> 01:12:18.573]  Ready.
[01:12:18.593 --> 01:12:19.234]  Okay, it is 866-894-1767.
[01:12:19.254 --> 01:12:19.694]  Do you have that?
[01:12:19.754 --> 01:12:20.114]  Got it.
[01:12:26.055 --> 01:12:27.236]  Alright Mona, I'm going to let you go.
[01:12:28.057 --> 01:12:33.421]  Yes, please fax that right over and we'll be doing Prison Planet and Info War Stories ASAP.
[01:12:33.461 --> 01:12:35.883]  We're going to get that to Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson.
[01:12:35.904 --> 01:12:37.925]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:12:38.226 --> 01:12:39.467]  Let's go to our next caller.
[01:12:39.847 --> 01:12:42.149]  Let's go to Ryan in Canada.
[01:12:42.209 --> 01:12:42.910]  Ryan, you're on the line.
[01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:44.391]  Hey Jason, how you doing?
[01:12:44.651 --> 01:12:45.011]  Alright.
[01:12:45.752 --> 01:12:46.733]  Awesome, glad to be with you.
[01:12:46.993 --> 01:12:49.375]  I just found some information about two weeks ago.
[01:12:49.395 --> 01:12:51.297]  I thought it might be interesting to call and let you know.
[01:12:51.877 --> 01:12:53.759]  The RCMP in Canada have actually been
[01:12:54.585 --> 01:12:57.169]  This is coming from someone who's a member of the clergy.
[01:12:57.189 --> 01:13:02.357]  The police in Canada have been preparing for a pandemic and apparently they've known about it for a very long time.
[01:13:03.198 --> 01:13:08.987]  They've been going through training, they've had conferences in Ottawa, all about the pandemic and how they're going to handle it.
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:12.922]  I mean, it's a bit weird, don't you think, that they're planning everything?
[01:13:12.942 --> 01:13:15.083]  Well, you know, they've talked about using schools.
[01:13:15.363 --> 01:13:16.244]  I mean, not even talked about.
[01:13:16.264 --> 01:13:20.226]  They've said they're going to use schools as mass vaccination centers, but they're not going to stop there.
[01:13:20.266 --> 01:13:25.269]  They figure that community centers and churches are another way to get mass gatherings of people.
[01:13:25.869 --> 01:13:27.231]  And to take these vaccinations.
[01:13:27.251 --> 01:13:38.343]  So it doesn't really shock me that they would use the clergy as we know about the clergy response teams for a couple of years now that will be working with departments like the Department of Homeland Security here in this country.
[01:13:38.644 --> 01:13:40.746]  So it really isn't a shock to me.
[01:13:41.306 --> 01:13:46.853]  Are they saying that they may use this as a mass vaccination center somewhere where they may offer the vaccine?
[01:13:47.586 --> 01:13:54.070]  I haven't really gotten a whole lot of information on it, but I am still trying to talk to the minister that was involved in this.
[01:13:54.330 --> 01:14:07.859]  Well, you've got to be careful, because a lot of these ministers and a lot of these priests and a lot of these clergymen are now on government payrolls, and they're there to tell you to love the government, do whatever they say, they're here to help, when we know it is the exact opposite.
[01:14:07.899 --> 01:14:10.341]  Keep doing your research and let me know as it develops.
[01:14:10.361 --> 01:14:11.381]  Thank you so much, Ryan.
[01:14:11.662 --> 01:14:13.803]  Let's jump to Stuart in New York.
[01:14:13.843 --> 01:14:14.643]  Stuart, you're on the line.
[01:14:15.124 --> 01:14:16.845]  Pleased to talk with you, Jason.
[01:14:17.313 --> 01:14:39.752]  I'm just wondering, and considering how vicious the Pittsburgh police attack so many innocent people and in regards to what's going on in Montana with non-citizens, I'm just wondering, they're wearing these Darth Vader suits, not for their own personal protection physically, but more to disguise their identities, I'm just wondering,
[01:14:40.208 --> 01:14:44.150]  How many of these so-called police were really American citizens?
[01:14:44.591 --> 01:14:48.353]  Well, I would say the majority of them were in actuality American citizens.
[01:14:48.433 --> 01:14:55.097]  I didn't see a lot of foreigners out there, but I did see a lot of blurring of the lines whether or not they were National Guard or not.
[01:14:55.117 --> 01:14:55.957]  Let me give you an example.
[01:14:55.997 --> 01:15:03.782]  The first riot police I saw were wearing regular riot police tops and uniforms, but they were wearing military fatigues on the bottom.
[01:15:04.302 --> 01:15:05.163]  When I went to the
[01:15:05.983 --> 01:15:06.403]  I don't
[01:15:24.289 --> 01:15:30.335]  When I outwardly saw just military, I mean they were in full military garb, admittedly National Guard.
[01:15:30.695 --> 01:15:34.379]  I did not, I did see a lot of foreign security forces.
[01:15:34.399 --> 01:15:40.705]  In other words, people in suits acting as secret service type agents in the hotels and downtown area.
[01:15:41.105 --> 01:15:44.909]  But you know this time they were able to use American citizens and a lot of these
[01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:53.498]  National Guardsman said, you know, I'll defend your right to free speech every day while they're in riot gear on the streets shooting tear gas at people.
[01:15:53.538 --> 01:15:58.784]  And with that, with that said, we're going to go to that video of the young people at the college.
[01:15:58.824 --> 01:16:03.509]  If we can bring that up, Jaron and Hoosh, of the the incident at Pittsburgh.
[01:16:04.503 --> 01:16:20.351]  On Friday night, when these kids are on a balcony, when the cops start shooting off rubber bullets, they start shooting off the tear gas canisters, and they actually go into the building and up the stairs onto this balcony and corner all these kids that are now being tear gassed.
[01:16:20.611 --> 01:16:27.414]  So let's go to that video, then we're going to continue with your calls, Michael, Scott, Dan, Scott, and Gary, right after this.
[01:16:27.454 --> 01:16:28.995]  So let's hit that clip right now.
[01:16:30.899 --> 01:16:31.419]  Oh boy!
[01:16:31.459 --> 01:16:32.640]  This is what America looks like!
[01:16:48.683 --> 01:16:52.505]  And I mean, you're really looking at something like out of a science fiction movie.
[01:16:53.625 --> 01:16:56.166]  All these protesters are mostly college students.
[01:16:56.206 --> 01:16:58.107]  There are no anarchists amongst them.
[01:16:58.147 --> 01:16:59.567]  Not one anarchist.
[01:16:59.607 --> 01:17:00.848]  And there you see the flashes.
[01:17:01.148 --> 01:17:02.929]  There you see the tear gas canisters.
[01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:05.290]  You hear the rubber bullets going off right now.
[01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:07.371]  You're watching it on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:17:07.411 --> 01:17:10.052]  One of the protesters throws one back at them.
[01:17:10.612 --> 01:17:11.572]  But it's a moot point.
[01:17:11.592 --> 01:17:13.033]  They're all wearing gas masks.
[01:17:13.433 --> 01:17:16.075]  Here's where it gets really, really scary.
[01:17:16.795 --> 01:17:19.317]  The kids that are on the balcony, they think they're safe.
[01:17:19.357 --> 01:17:19.918]  They're not.
[01:17:20.818 --> 01:17:22.840]  Tear gas to come up the stairwells.
[01:17:24.561 --> 01:17:25.722]  Yes, they're inside.
[01:17:25.742 --> 01:17:27.683]  Are we trapped here?
[01:17:38.979 --> 01:17:45.885]  And here they are being tear gassed as the riot police pass them up the stairwell and corner them.
[01:17:54.795 --> 01:17:55.795]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:17:55.815 --> 01:18:05.398]  We're going to pull the clip because there is some obscenities that come up later on that we have not edited out, but the full clip is available at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:18:05.879 --> 01:18:15.902]  And a young girl, I don't know whether or not she gets pulled, she gets hit by a rubber bullet, but she gets hit by something and her neck begins to bleed up by her ear.
[01:18:16.742 --> 01:18:18.264]  This is just unbelievable.
[01:18:18.364 --> 01:18:22.108]  This is, again folks, the new America.
[01:18:22.529 --> 01:18:23.630]  The new tyranny.
[01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:29.617]  Jackboot thugs ruling over us, stopping us from assembling peaceably.
[01:18:31.172 --> 01:18:33.893]  The Founding Fathers would be rolling over in their graves.
[01:18:34.613 --> 01:18:35.153]  You know what?
[01:18:35.173 --> 01:18:36.953]  They wouldn't be rolling over in their graves.
[01:18:37.193 --> 01:18:41.074]  They would be getting their muskets and saying, that's enough.
[01:18:41.674 --> 01:18:42.855]  We've had it.
[01:18:42.955 --> 01:18:48.456]  These people stood up for taxation without representation because they were being taxed too much by the king.
[01:18:48.716 --> 01:18:53.217]  Do you think we're being taxed too much when they start to say, yeah, you know, a carbon tax is a good idea?
[01:18:53.917 --> 01:18:56.499]  Yeah, one-child policies are a good idea.
[01:18:56.999 --> 01:19:02.822]  Salon.com publishing articles saying that contraception curbs global warming.
[01:19:03.663 --> 01:19:07.285]  Basically telling you don't have children or you're screwing the planet.
[01:19:08.006 --> 01:19:09.366]  That's what we're here for.
[01:19:09.667 --> 01:19:11.027]  We're here to procreate.
[01:19:11.428 --> 01:19:13.189]  We're here to expand our family.
[01:19:13.729 --> 01:19:15.030]  We're here to love one another.
[01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:18.052]  We're not here to say, no, you can't have children.
[01:19:19.153 --> 01:19:20.675]  No, you can't have a family.
[01:19:20.955 --> 01:19:23.038]  Yes, the state is your God.
[01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:25.080]  Big Brother loves you.
[01:19:25.361 --> 01:19:26.722]  That's not why we're here.
[01:19:26.742 --> 01:19:29.566]  We're here to flourish as humanity.
[01:19:31.048 --> 01:19:37.155]  Not to stop one another from experiencing life, from experiencing love.
[01:19:38.223 --> 01:19:47.126]  From being in fear all the time, so we start sucking our thumbs in a fetal position, letting the state walk all over us, letting the establishment have their way with us.
[01:19:47.906 --> 01:19:50.847]  We're going to come back with more calls, Alex Jones coming up.
[01:19:50.907 --> 01:19:52.107]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:52.187 --> 01:19:55.969]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in PrisonPlanet.tv and Fowars.com.
[01:20:01.691 --> 01:20:02.871]  Remain in your houses.
[01:20:03.698 --> 01:20:08.865]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[01:20:09.465 --> 01:20:10.447]  Will they do it?
[01:20:10.827 --> 01:20:12.790]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[01:20:13.451 --> 01:20:19.458]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[01:20:19.899 --> 01:20:21.160]  Think it can't happen here?
[01:20:22.081 --> 01:20:25.603]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[01:20:26.364 --> 01:20:30.646]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[01:20:31.247 --> 01:20:35.529]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[01:20:36.150 --> 01:20:40.973]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[01:20:41.893 --> 01:20:50.004]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[01:20:50.325 --> 01:20:52.587]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.

[01:20:55.892 --> 01:20:58.816]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[01:20:59.969 --> 01:21:01.970]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:21:02.110 --> 01:21:04.470]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:21:04.490 --> 01:21:07.071]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:21:07.091 --> 01:21:08.311]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:21:08.331 --> 01:21:09.952]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[01:21:10.052 --> 01:21:12.873]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:21:12.933 --> 01:21:17.914]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, the Ulysses?
[01:21:26.230 --> 01:21:31.116]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:21:34.898 --> 01:21:35.939]  How dare you?
[01:21:37.521 --> 01:21:42.385]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:21:42.405 --> 01:21:45.208]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:21:45.308 --> 01:21:51.735]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rises.

[01:21:54.617 --> 01:21:56.619]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:21:56.879 --> 01:21:59.362]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:22:00.672 --> 01:22:01.512]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:22:01.692 --> 01:22:07.035]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:22:07.235 --> 01:22:07.655]  I get it.
[01:22:07.775 --> 01:22:17.159]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:18.560]  That's not what's happening.
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:27.047]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:22:27.287 --> 01:22:30.550]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:22:30.670 --> 01:22:34.753]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:22:34.933 --> 01:22:35.934]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:22:36.535 --> 01:22:39.777]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:22:39.937 --> 01:22:44.101]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:22:44.301 --> 01:22:45.002]  You should, too.
[01:22:45.203 --> 01:22:46.184]  Find out what they know.

[01:24:07.179 --> 01:24:09.926]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:17.470]  We are back live.
[01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:18.210]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:18.230 --> 01:24:19.810]  We're going to continue to take your calls.
[01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:21.291]  Alex calling in shortly.
[01:24:21.311 --> 01:24:25.553]  But for PrisonPlanet.TV subscribers, I want to play this video.
[01:24:26.333 --> 01:24:33.856]  The local KULR station now reporting, yeah, you know, he's got 17 aliases.
[01:24:33.936 --> 01:24:38.358]  Yeah, he spent some time in a California state correctional facility.
[01:24:38.418 --> 01:24:38.878]  Yeah.
[01:24:39.278 --> 01:24:47.487]  He's lost some civil suits of over a million dollars that he hasn't paid, but he also has a current outstanding warrant in Wyoming.
[01:24:47.527 --> 01:24:48.848]  He's a wanted criminal!
[01:24:49.589 --> 01:24:53.013]  And again, the elite and the establishment love criminals.
[01:24:54.529 --> 01:24:56.931]  Who don't care about the American people.
[01:24:57.511 --> 01:25:01.334]  They're not under our jurisdiction of we the people.
[01:25:01.354 --> 01:25:02.535]  So let's go to this video.
[01:25:03.075 --> 01:25:05.277]  PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:25:05.297 --> 01:25:08.919]  ...an investigation into a California company's plan to take over the Hardin Jail.
[01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:15.104]  The probe came one day after the criminal past of American police force leader Michael Hilton is revealed.
[01:25:15.224 --> 01:25:20.748]  Yesterday, concerns of Montana citizens showed up at the Hardin Jail, joining officials in the quest for answers.
[01:25:21.128 --> 01:25:23.770]  Colorado's Nick Law went to Hardin and has the details.
[01:25:24.110 --> 01:25:24.750]  Hello?
[01:25:25.391 --> 01:25:26.231]  Anybody home?
[01:25:27.652 --> 01:25:34.895]  Tony Myers drove from Columbus, Montana in search of answers in the ongoing story between a hardened jail and American police force.
[01:25:35.435 --> 01:25:39.738]  I just want to know who they are, why they're coming here, who they're bringing in.
[01:25:39.938 --> 01:25:42.919]  My job is not to give you the answers that you want.
[01:25:42.959 --> 01:25:48.842]  My job is to give you the information that I have been employed to release or not release.
[01:25:49.537 --> 01:26:04.012]  Caught in the crossfire is APF spokesperson Becky Shea, who spent all day answering questions from media members and the public after an AP story linked the security firm's leader, Michael Hilton, to multiple bankruptcies and convictions for more than a dozen felonies.
[01:26:04.673 --> 01:26:05.934]  There were no surprises.
[01:26:06.195 --> 01:26:12.341]  Michael disclosed this information to me before I agreed to come to work for him.
[01:26:12.856 --> 01:26:20.741]  Shea and TRA Vice President Al Peterson both say they knew about the convictions long before the report came out, but are still confident in APF.
[01:26:21.281 --> 01:26:26.164]  I firmly believe APF is legitimate and a solid corporation.
[01:26:26.464 --> 01:26:38.111]  Peterson declined an on-camera interview, but released this statement saying, quote, I believe that the TRA has a better chance of getting the detention facility open with APF than with any Montana officials.
[01:26:38.651 --> 01:26:40.873]  What do we have to lose if it doesn't work out?
[01:26:41.193 --> 01:26:41.593]  End quote.
[01:26:42.122 --> 01:26:46.527]  APF also continues to stand firm on its stance to not release the parent company.
[01:26:46.967 --> 01:26:49.369]  That information won't be disclosed.
[01:26:50.230 --> 01:26:53.374]  But Myers and others like her pledge to continue their research.
[01:26:53.974 --> 01:26:56.797]  They're putting in a criminal to watch criminals?
[01:26:57.558 --> 01:27:00.901]  And try to get to the bottom of the mystery behind the Hardin jail.
[01:27:01.562 --> 01:27:04.165]  Reporting in Hardin, Nick Law, Color 8 News.
[01:27:04.997 --> 01:27:07.178]  Calls to Michael Hilton were not returned.
[01:27:07.238 --> 01:27:14.939]  APF spokesperson Becky Shea says Hilton is currently in California on business and is expected back in Hardin in the next couple of weeks.
[01:27:15.299 --> 01:27:25.602]  Well, court records from Orange County, California indicate Michael Hilton has a lengthy criminal past, including a six-year prison sentence for a dozen counts of grand theft and other charges.
[01:27:26.042 --> 01:27:37.606]  Court documents show more than a decade of courtroom appearances for Hilton starting in 1982 through 1999 on charges including bad checks, fraud, breach of contract, and grand theft.
[01:27:38.087 --> 01:27:45.429]  After his release from prison, court documents indicate he was entangled in at least three civil lawsuits alleging fraud or misrepresentation.
[01:27:45.970 --> 01:27:50.051]  And we learned just yesterday there's a warrant out for Hilton's arrest in Wyoming.
[01:27:50.531 --> 01:27:54.813]  A Sheridan County, Wyoming Circuit Court judge issued a warrant September 1st.
[01:27:55.493 --> 01:28:02.178]  A court clerk says he was ticketed for driving with a suspended driver's license on Interstate 90 in Sheridan County on August 15th.
[01:28:02.438 --> 01:28:06.721]  The arrest warrant was issued after he failed to appear in court.
[01:28:07.722 --> 01:28:09.383]  All right, let's continue with the callers.
[01:28:09.443 --> 01:28:11.324]  Let's go to Michael in Texas.
[01:28:11.384 --> 01:28:12.165]  Michael, you're on the line.
[01:28:13.466 --> 01:28:14.146]  Yeah, Burmese.
[01:28:14.206 --> 01:28:16.608]  This is my horn calling from Wichita Falls, Texas.
[01:28:16.628 --> 01:28:17.448]  How you doing today?
[01:28:17.729 --> 01:28:18.069]  All right.
[01:28:19.170 --> 01:28:23.813]  Hey, there's one thing that I'm talking about this Montana story as it develops that
[01:28:24.654 --> 01:28:48.164]  Uh, came to mind, I used to hold a security officer license here in Texas for about four years, and I've been going through the Montana, it's mt.gov website, in order to find the Montana Board of Private Security, to find out if there's even a current license for this American police force, which, so far to my search, I haven't found one.
[01:28:48.646 --> 01:28:54.954]  Well, you know, that'll tie into a story by Felix Barber over at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:28:55.455 --> 01:28:57.177]  The headline is, APF License?
[01:28:57.397 --> 01:28:58.899]  We don't need no stinking license.
[01:28:58.919 --> 01:29:07.030]  When the scene started to unfold in Hardin, Montana, my first reaction could be best described as an overwhelming feeling of despair, the thought that our worst fears were coming true.
[01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:09.151]  So it doesn't appear that they do have a license.
[01:29:09.171 --> 01:29:10.712]  We're going to continue with your calls.
[01:29:10.732 --> 01:29:12.693]  We're going to go to Scott, Dan, Gary, Chris, and more.
[01:29:12.713 --> 01:29:13.593]  Alex Jones coming up after this segment.
[01:29:36.465 --> 01:29:37.546]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:37.586 --> 01:29:42.150]  Remember, pre-order Fall of the Republic right now to be the first to receive it.
[01:29:42.230 --> 01:29:48.455]  It drops October 21st with a ton of bonuses and a ton of features you haven't seen anywhere else before.
[01:29:48.475 --> 01:29:50.336]  Go check out InfoWars.com.
[01:29:50.356 --> 01:29:51.117]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.617 --> 01:29:53.199]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.219 --> 01:29:56.822]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.599 --> 01:30:03.583]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:30:03.843 --> 01:30:05.605]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:30:05.845 --> 01:30:14.113]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:30:14.374 --> 01:30:19.579]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:30:19.919 --> 01:30:21.541]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:30:21.761 --> 01:30:28.083]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:30:28.283 --> 01:30:39.027]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:30:39.327 --> 01:30:39.827]  That's right.
[01:30:40.107 --> 01:30:42.408]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:30:42.668 --> 01:30:44.228]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[01:30:46.589 --> 01:31:02.141]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[01:31:02.442 --> 01:31:05.884]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:31:06.064 --> 01:31:07.986]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:31:08.206 --> 01:31:11.288]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:31:11.609 --> 01:31:13.470]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[01:31:15.128 --> 01:31:15.508]  We're good.
[01:31:45.188 --> 01:31:45.548]  We're good.
[01:32:01.377 --> 01:32:06.181]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[01:32:06.562 --> 01:32:06.962]  I'm not.
[01:32:07.082 --> 01:32:07.743]  Don't trust it.
[01:32:07.823 --> 01:32:09.704]  But then I don't want to get the disease either.
[01:32:10.045 --> 01:32:15.490]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:18.232]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[01:32:18.332 --> 01:32:22.396]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[01:32:22.896 --> 01:32:25.619]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[01:32:26.039 --> 01:32:31.487]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[01:32:31.787 --> 01:32:33.710]  That's NoGerms.info.
[01:32:34.030 --> 01:32:42.361]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[01:32:42.601 --> 01:32:43.603]  Don't pick your nose.
[01:32:43.963 --> 01:32:48.245]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails and doorknobs.
[01:32:48.545 --> 01:32:49.886]  Do try PureWorks.
[01:32:50.026 --> 01:32:53.447]  Available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[01:32:53.647 --> 01:32:55.348]  Go to no germs dot info.
[01:32:55.408 --> 01:32:57.129]  That's no germs dot info.
[01:32:57.609 --> 01:32:59.110]  Be well and stay well.
[01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.570]  Best.
[01:33:20.461 --> 01:33:21.102]  We are back.
[01:33:21.162 --> 01:33:22.263]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.303 --> 01:33:23.564]  I am Jason Burmas sitting in.
[01:33:23.644 --> 01:33:25.245]  Alex joining us momentarily.
[01:33:25.265 --> 01:33:27.507]  We're going to continue with your calls in just a moment.
[01:33:28.728 --> 01:33:32.111]  But I want to read more of this article that the caller just brought up.
[01:33:32.191 --> 01:33:33.092]  APF license.
[01:33:33.172 --> 01:33:35.774]  We don't need no stinking license as you read into it.
[01:33:36.535 --> 01:33:39.057]  American Police Force is a California corporation.
[01:33:39.077 --> 01:33:43.942]  In order to advertise for investigative services in the state of California, one must be licensed.
[01:33:44.542 --> 01:33:49.384]  And the licenses must advertise using the name that the license is issued under.
[01:33:49.464 --> 01:33:59.527]  I went to the website of bsis.ca.gov slash online services slash verify licenses shtml.
[01:34:00.347 --> 01:34:05.489]  This is the website for the California Department of Consumer Affairs Bureau of Security and Investigative Services.
[01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:09.910]  They have a database that anyone can use to verify a license.
[01:34:09.930 --> 01:34:11.491]  You simply put in the name of the company.
[01:34:12.606 --> 01:34:15.727]  And under it, it will tell you whether that firm is licensed or not.
[01:34:16.087 --> 01:34:18.788]  As I suspected, no matches were found.
[01:34:18.828 --> 01:34:26.771]  They are not licensed to operate as a private investigator, nor as a security operator required to provide bodyguard services.
[01:34:27.172 --> 01:34:35.355]  I knew this would be the case going in because the state of California will not issue a license to a company that has the word police as part of its company name.
[01:34:35.535 --> 01:34:40.997]  But remember, this is under some other umbrella corporation that has remained secret as of this point.
[01:34:41.577 --> 01:34:42.978]  Alright, let's continue with the callers.
[01:34:42.998 --> 01:34:44.418]  Let's go to Dan in Pennsylvania.
[01:34:44.438 --> 01:34:45.339]  Dan, you're on the line.
[01:34:59.332 --> 01:35:00.353]  Yes.
[01:35:00.473 --> 01:35:02.495]  This is about Hilton there.
[01:35:03.415 --> 01:35:09.881]  I went to this website, I surf around a lot, and it's whatdoesitmean.com.
[01:35:10.121 --> 01:35:11.442]  I've been there before, of course.
[01:35:11.502 --> 01:35:15.945]  It's under an article named Obama in Secret Russia.
[01:35:16.586 --> 01:35:17.587]  Visit warns.com.
[01:35:18.366 --> 01:35:23.910]  Putin, I may not make it, about three quarters of the way down, okay?
[01:35:24.510 --> 01:35:34.856]  It goes into an American police force company, which is owned by one of the most brutal fascist warlords of the former nation of Yugoslavia, named Dmitry Ilyich
[01:35:40.031 --> 01:35:46.973]  So they're telling you that this guy, one of his aliases, is this alias that you're saying, and that he is just a brutal military dictator.
[01:35:47.234 --> 01:35:48.474]  Yeah, and then it goes on.
[01:35:48.994 --> 01:36:02.479]  Who, when brought to the United States by the CIA, in parenthesis, who backed his brutal troops in the destruction of the Balkan Genocide Wars, changed his name to Michael Anthony Hilton.
[01:36:03.592 --> 01:36:06.375]  Well, that's incredible.
[01:36:06.455 --> 01:36:09.258]  Is there a source article or is this just up on that website?
[01:36:09.298 --> 01:36:13.262]  I mean, did they pull this from some kind of an Associated Press or other mainline article?
[01:36:14.023 --> 01:36:14.583]  I'm not sure.
[01:36:14.623 --> 01:36:15.644]  I'm trying to get into that.
[01:36:16.616 --> 01:36:17.757]  Well let me tell you how you do it.
[01:36:18.017 --> 01:36:21.281]  What you do is you take a section of the article, a few sentences, alright?
[01:36:21.641 --> 01:36:31.511]  You copy that and then you paste it into Google and then all articles that have republished it or initially published it will come up so you can kind of see where the sources are.
[01:36:31.731 --> 01:36:36.296]  We would appreciate it if you took that link and you sent it over to articles at InfoWars.com
[01:36:36.576 --> 01:36:49.047]  Or writers at Infowars.com, because if he is one and the same, and this is the same Michael Hilton, and he has not only CIA ties, but military dictatorship ties in Yugoslavia, this is huge, Dan.
[01:36:50.288 --> 01:36:56.693]  On here as well, a couple of major sentence links, okay, because it was just posted today.
[01:36:56.713 --> 01:37:00.917]  It says, imagine a bloodless coup
[01:37:01.713 --> 01:37:10.941]  Uh, to restore the defense and defend the Constitution through an intern administration that would do serious business of governing and defending the nation.
[01:37:11.382 --> 01:37:18.208]  Skilled military-trained nation-builders would replace accountability-challenged radical left commissioners.
[01:37:18.728 --> 01:37:25.474]  Having bonded with their twin teleprompters, the President would be detailed for ceremonial speech-making.
[01:37:26.479 --> 01:37:50.260]  Well it is creepy stuff and I just hope that you can get that article to us as soon as possible and all the info warriors out there can check it out and either verify or disprove this but you know the way things are going it looks like we're going to be able to verify this this guy has all the markings of this type of a dictator this type of a strongman someone that the CIA would back and you know he admittedly said that his boss
[01:37:50.660 --> 01:38:03.687]  was an ex-army colonel named Richard Culver and this was at the point when he was just calling himself Captain Michael and not giving out his last name and again under the very deceptive name of American Police Force.
[01:38:04.047 --> 01:38:13.452]  It's not American, it's not a police force, it's not even a licensed security firm according to this article and according to the California State Board website.
[01:38:13.492 --> 01:38:14.653]  I thank you for the call Dan.
[01:38:14.973 --> 01:38:17.314]  Let's jump to Gary in Massachusetts.
[01:38:17.374 --> 01:38:18.235]  Gary, you're on the line.
[01:38:18.975 --> 01:38:20.216]  Hey Jason, how you doing today?
[01:38:20.552 --> 01:38:20.912]  All right.
[01:38:21.813 --> 01:38:30.639]  Listen, Deb, this is really important and I just made a couple tiny URLs for you and for the listeners, tinyurl.com forward slash fluinserts.
[01:38:31.579 --> 01:38:39.464]  You would not believe what's in all the normal, and I say normal, not swine flu injections and in particular Flumist.
[01:38:39.564 --> 01:38:41.065]  Have you checked out the ingredients?
[01:38:41.425 --> 01:38:47.669]  Well, we've actually posted some of those scans that people have sent in and it admittedly has thimerosal formaldehyde and squalene in it.
[01:38:47.709 --> 01:38:48.910]  And, and,
[01:38:50.732 --> 01:38:53.953]  H1N1 in every single normal flu shot!
[01:38:54.033 --> 01:38:55.514]  That is huge!
[01:38:55.774 --> 01:38:57.294]  That is huge!
[01:38:57.354 --> 01:39:02.356]  It actually says this on the inserts that H1N1 is included in the shot.
[01:39:03.016 --> 01:39:16.461]  Go to FDA.gov and just type in flu insert and look at every single flu manufacturer's insert from Flumist to Fluzine to Fluzone to you name it.
[01:39:17.037 --> 01:39:19.719]  Normal flu shots and especially Flumist.
[01:39:19.799 --> 01:39:24.302]  Now when questioned at a public school, I said to the principal, what are you doing?
[01:39:24.602 --> 01:39:26.483]  You ought to tell the parents it has it in it.
[01:39:27.084 --> 01:39:28.405]  Oh, we'll just switch to Flumist.
[01:39:28.945 --> 01:39:35.549]  Do you know, Jason, that Flumist spreads whatever's in it after people sneeze for up to 20 days?
[01:39:37.878 --> 01:39:45.720]  Well, it's not a shock, and that would explain why they're really pushing this new nasal spray as the alternate to the actual vaccination.
[01:39:46.021 --> 01:39:47.821]  Oh, we'll vaccinate you with a nasal spray.
[01:39:47.841 --> 01:39:49.162]  You don't want to take the shot?
[01:39:49.182 --> 01:39:50.682]  We'll just right up your nose.
[01:39:50.962 --> 01:39:52.923]  And Fox News is promoting it heavily.
[01:39:53.103 --> 01:39:58.484]  They're trying to scare pregnant women into taking this by saying one in three of pregnant women who have contracted H1N1 die.
[01:40:00.385 --> 01:40:03.426]  You are going to poison your unborn child if you take this stuff.
[01:40:03.726 --> 01:40:09.449]  Gary, I need you to send these scans over to Articles at InfoWars, Writers at InfoWars, or if you can fax them to us.
[01:40:10.169 --> 01:40:12.350]  Let me see if I have the fax number in front of me still.
[01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:12.990]  I think I do.
[01:40:13.410 --> 01:40:18.452]  The fax number to InfoWars is 866-894-1767.
[01:40:18.873 --> 01:40:19.933]  Do so immediately.
[01:40:19.973 --> 01:40:20.953]  We appreciate you.
[01:40:20.993 --> 01:40:22.254]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:40:22.514 --> 01:40:24.275]  Let's go to Chris in Kentucky.
[01:40:24.315 --> 01:40:25.075]  Chris, you're on the line.
[01:40:26.416 --> 01:40:26.756]  Hey, Jay.
[01:40:27.276 --> 01:40:27.476]  Yes.
[01:40:27.896 --> 01:40:29.877]  I just wanted to report on a
[01:40:30.385 --> 01:40:32.226]  Associated Press article out of Frankfort.
[01:40:32.746 --> 01:40:33.047]  Okay.
[01:40:34.027 --> 01:40:37.849]  It says, Marine training exercise disturbs Kentucky neighborhood.
[01:40:38.529 --> 01:40:44.253]  Some Central Kentucky residents say military training exercises damage their property.
[01:40:45.593 --> 01:40:52.497]  Frankfort resident, Tim Evans, said they were flying aircraft and they volunteered.
[01:40:52.517 --> 01:40:54.138]  Which is no offense.
[01:40:55.072 --> 01:40:56.073]  You're breaking up, Chris.
[01:40:56.113 --> 01:40:57.194]  Chris, Chris, you're breaking up.
[01:40:57.214 --> 01:40:58.815]  Can you repeat that last part for me?
[01:40:59.015 --> 01:41:03.518]  What kind of residential property damage have we seen and what kind of exercise is this?
[01:41:04.499 --> 01:41:07.261]  Okay, well first, what kind of exercise?
[01:41:08.222 --> 01:41:17.108]  Captain Robert Shuford, spokesman for the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, said the unit was doing an urban training exercise and didn't mean to destroy
[01:41:17.532 --> 01:41:19.233]  Chris, Chris, I've got Alex on the line.
[01:41:19.253 --> 01:41:23.834]  I'm going to need you to send that information to articles at InfoWars or writers at InfoWars.com.
[01:41:24.294 --> 01:41:28.595]  Alex on the ground in Montana right now, in Hardin.
[01:41:28.775 --> 01:41:29.055]  Alex?
[01:41:30.776 --> 01:41:33.556]  Jason, you know, I'm fine if that caller's still there.
[01:41:33.576 --> 01:41:34.857]  I want to hear that about the Marines.
[01:41:34.917 --> 01:41:39.218]  They're doing drills in Tennessee, Kentucky, all over the country.
[01:41:39.298 --> 01:41:41.479]  I noticed they're doing these drills that didn't go live.
[01:41:41.499 --> 01:41:44.419]  And they do this on purpose to condition the public.
[01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:46.060]  Is that caller still there?
[01:41:46.873 --> 01:41:48.774]  I'm not sure if he's still... Yes, he is.
[01:41:48.814 --> 01:41:49.514]  Go ahead, Collin.
[01:41:49.554 --> 01:41:50.435]  You go ahead, sir.
[01:41:50.455 --> 01:41:52.476]  Take three minutes, finish your story, then I'll come back.
[01:41:52.496 --> 01:41:52.816]  Go ahead.
[01:41:53.776 --> 01:42:06.623]  Okay, I just... It says that the low-flying aircraft, I presume a helicopter, knocked over a picnic table and chairs and damaged his wood fence and tossed his daughter's playset across the yard.
[01:42:06.683 --> 01:42:13.366]  His neighbor, Jonda Hopper, says her phone cable lines were knocked down and tree limbs were tossed into her yard.
[01:42:14.570 --> 01:42:18.178]  What's the headline on this article, Chris, so we can get this up at InfoWars.com?
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:22.770]  It says, Marine Training Exercise Disturbs Kentucky Neighborhood.
[01:42:23.203 --> 01:42:24.463]  Alright, we are on it.
[01:42:24.924 --> 01:42:43.249]  Alex, we also got a caller in, and we can't confirm this yet, that this Michael Hilden character is actually out of Yugoslavia, ran, you know, death squad type military units out there, and was moved here by the CIA and given the name Michael Hilden.
[01:42:43.269 --> 01:42:45.330]  We're developing that story as we speak.
[01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:46.350]  Just incredible stuff.
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:52.382]  Well, again, that's the problem, is he does have a lot of funds.
[01:42:52.723 --> 01:42:53.163]  Millions.
[01:42:53.543 --> 01:42:55.645]  And he has been here making some of the payments.
[01:42:55.685 --> 01:42:59.227]  The news is saying he's got another big payment to make in February.
[01:43:00.088 --> 01:43:02.169]  And he has been spreading a lot of money around town.
[01:43:02.189 --> 01:43:03.190]  I've been talking to the people.
[01:43:03.970 --> 01:43:16.119]  And then you look at his M.O., it's $100,000 thefts, $200,000 thefts, uh, chival victories against him in court, as well, for a million, too.
[01:43:19.833 --> 01:43:31.176]  Again, we're just investigating all of this, trying to find out exactly what's happening and exactly what's going on here, but I want to give you an update on that in just a moment.
[01:43:31.756 --> 01:43:48.401]  First off, going back to what the gentleman said, before I left town, I noticed urban warfare drills all over the country, namely Tennessee, Kentucky, and others, with the Army, with the Marines, and I talked to Thomas Sanchez back in 99, the head of emergency management in Kingsville, Texas,
[01:43:49.167 --> 01:43:55.348]  And they admitted to him that this was being done to condition the public.
[01:43:55.888 --> 01:43:58.809]  They admitted to him that this was basically acclimation for occupation.
[01:43:58.869 --> 01:44:01.849]  Now, that's not even debatable.
[01:44:02.809 --> 01:44:06.910]  They're coming out and just putting regular National Guard, Army, Marines on the streets.
[01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:12.071]  And so it's this slow, incremental unfolding of this agenda.
[01:44:12.091 --> 01:44:18.412]  But now, here at the end, it's all intersecting and getting sped up, kind of like birthing pains with a woman.
[01:44:19.588 --> 01:44:30.516]  You know, as she gets down to delivering the baby, as she goes through labor for 12 hours, the last 30 minutes, the contractions are closer and closer until it's all just one big contraction.
[01:44:31.377 --> 01:44:34.459]  And that's why we see all the different activities just exploding.
[01:44:34.879 --> 01:44:38.722]  The bottom line here from Hardin, Montana, is I'm very glad I came here.
[01:44:39.462 --> 01:44:43.765]  Because more and more on the air I talk about this being like a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:44:44.426 --> 01:44:46.367]  You get to this very poor town,
[01:44:46.894 --> 01:45:02.439]  Bordering the Crow Indian Reservation, there are Native Americans, like right out of a stereotype, just completely drunk, walking around all over the streets, bumping into walls, falling down.
[01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:15.244]  Other Native Americans, nice looking happy families out taking their family to eat and things, but there's homeless old white people begging for money on the sides of the street.
[01:45:16.765 --> 01:45:25.953]  Uh, but there's also, you know, cheery, nice, you know, folks here as well, both, uh, both, uh, non-native and, uh, folks from Montana, Montana.
[01:45:26.773 --> 01:45:31.958]  And in the middle of it, you have this, this individual who's got a rap sheet the size of a New York phone book.
[01:45:31.978 --> 01:45:38.903]  I mean, every day, every few hours, new warrants in different states and new civil judgments and new felonies.
[01:45:39.043 --> 01:45:41.085]  And as you said, I saw that number 17 aliases.
[01:45:43.467 --> 01:45:45.768]  He is hooked into the government at certain levels.
[01:45:45.788 --> 01:45:49.969]  Now, the question is, the government's full of criminals, con artists, scammers.
[01:45:50.670 --> 01:45:53.211]  Was he just taken in because he was a fellow traveler?
[01:45:53.691 --> 01:45:56.792]  Or has he gone out and conned the U.S.
[01:45:56.812 --> 01:45:59.733]  government, other contractors, other groups?
[01:46:00.433 --> 01:46:02.734]  He's such a liar that we really don't know.
[01:46:03.034 --> 01:46:09.816]  It may just be that he's a complete con artist who was able to get a $27 million facility and have German mercenaries in tow.
[01:46:09.836 --> 01:46:11.077]  We've confirmed that's going on.
[01:46:11.738 --> 01:46:15.880]  And other Croatian and Serb people in tow of him.
[01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:19.861]  Or it could be this is something much bigger and much deeper.
[01:46:19.981 --> 01:46:39.308]  And the reason it may actually be, he may just be a front man, is if you look at it, they did a year ago, they're singing in pieces on this, I've talked to locals, try to turn the prison into a Guantanamo West, as it was called,
[01:46:40.109 --> 01:46:42.551]  Uh, to hold prisoners from Guantanamo Bay.
[01:46:43.392 --> 01:46:45.834]  And this other company does have offices.
[01:46:45.874 --> 01:46:48.215]  I saw their computers and phones and equipment in there.
[01:46:48.796 --> 01:46:52.399]  There's another company that they said, well, they've partially pulled out, but they're still here with us.
[01:46:52.919 --> 01:46:54.240]  I got different stories.
[01:46:54.820 --> 01:47:01.285]  And they were saying, we still may make this a, uh, you know, alien detainee center, enemy combatant center.
[01:47:01.325 --> 01:47:05.449]  And then I went into different offices and saw different blueprints and maps on the walls.
[01:47:06.249 --> 01:47:08.071]  Uh, the spokeswoman didn't want me to take that.
[01:47:08.091 --> 01:47:09.692]  It's on paper saying, please don't take that.
[01:47:10.823 --> 01:47:13.465]  And I think very, very suspiciously.
[01:47:13.485 --> 01:47:20.251]  So we do have a site, a FEMA camp, a center that the feds and the locals and others have.
[01:47:20.852 --> 01:47:32.301]  The feds tried to, were involved a year ago, trying to sell this to the state, but the legislature, the people in Helena and in Billings, the major cities, said we do not want this.
[01:47:33.182 --> 01:47:36.765]  And so it looks like they tried to come back through another organization
[01:47:37.426 --> 01:47:41.649]  To try to push it, is that until they said it was going to be an international training center for foreign troops?
[01:47:41.909 --> 01:47:47.593]  And we have confirmed, it is now in the Billings Gazette today.
[01:47:47.633 --> 01:47:55.698]  In fact, I just came out of one of the city offices and just had the new Billings Gazette article.
[01:47:55.719 --> 01:47:57.600]  In fact, it's behind me here and it's about to give it to me.
[01:47:58.741 --> 01:48:04.605]  And it does confirm, we're going to, I'm on the air, we need to get in and we're going to do that.
[01:48:04.665 --> 01:48:04.925]  Thanks.
[01:48:06.496 --> 01:48:07.997]  Let me have those papers you're sitting on, thank you.
[01:48:09.818 --> 01:48:34.475]  The Billings Gazette today confirms that without authorization, the Two Rivers Authority, this private consortium that's basically taking over the town, it has its officials running for mayor, it has its officials and their officials' wives in the city council, and it's kind of like their own little boss hog type constabulary, or I guess you'd call it good ol' boy mafia around here.
[01:48:35.509 --> 01:48:36.189]  We're good to go.
[01:49:05.555 --> 01:49:08.976]  And bring them back to the jail and make profits off of that.
[01:49:09.036 --> 01:49:10.596]  So a felon con artist.
[01:49:11.676 --> 01:49:12.556]  And I talked to locals.
[01:49:12.576 --> 01:49:22.378]  He walked around everywhere in his hardened police force, American police force, on one side it had a hardened police force, on the other it said American police force.
[01:49:22.838 --> 01:49:27.599]  And he was strutting around for weeks with his security man announcing that he was the police chief.
[01:49:27.659 --> 01:49:31.560]  Everyone was just groveling to him because he was foreign, had a foreign accent.
[01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:33.180]  They thought that was James Bondition.
[01:49:34.913 --> 01:49:40.397]  And he literally just strutted around smoking cigarettes with everyone bowing and hiding and worshipping him.
[01:49:41.198 --> 01:49:43.199]  And then they were preparing to just dispatch.
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:46.802]  And it turns out that the Big Horn County Sheriff was for this.
[01:49:47.203 --> 01:49:48.724]  His name is... What's the first name?
[01:49:48.744 --> 01:49:48.964]  Lawrence.
[01:49:50.065 --> 01:49:51.266]  Lawrence Big Hair.
[01:49:52.146 --> 01:49:53.347]  They can't make this up.
[01:49:54.668 --> 01:49:57.010]  I guess when he was born that's why he thought his name was Big Hair.
[01:49:57.691 --> 01:50:03.455]  But the point is that... And we've heard from... The Sheriff's always sick and no one can ever find him.
[01:50:03.939 --> 01:50:05.282]  They're saying he's sick right now.
[01:50:05.723 --> 01:50:08.388]  Locals have reported something else.
[01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:12.596]  Well, he has the native taste for certain things.
[01:50:12.977 --> 01:50:15.622]  The point is, it's really bad, folks.
[01:50:16.132 --> 01:50:19.895]  And this, I've never seen a boss locked down quite like this.
[01:50:20.255 --> 01:50:21.616]  But it's a microcosm.
[01:50:21.997 --> 01:50:24.699]  You drive across Texas, more prisons than anywhere else in the U.S.
[01:50:24.719 --> 01:50:26.560]  per capita, more prisons than anywhere else in the world.
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:27.261]  The U.S.
[01:50:27.321 --> 01:50:31.664]  is the capital of prisons nationwide and worldwide.
[01:50:31.744 --> 01:50:33.085]  Texas is the capital of that.
[01:50:33.105 --> 01:50:33.866]  So the U.S.
[01:50:33.906 --> 01:50:35.147]  is the capital worldwide of prisons.
[01:50:35.387 --> 01:50:36.048]  We'll be back after this.
[01:50:36.148 --> 01:50:37.028]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:37.048 --> 01:50:38.529]  Alex on the ground in Hardin, Montana.
[01:51:00.256 --> 01:51:05.599]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[01:51:06.139 --> 01:51:10.781]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[01:51:11.261 --> 01:51:11.881]  That was then.
[01:51:12.482 --> 01:51:13.122]  This is now.
[01:51:13.782 --> 01:51:16.003]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[01:51:16.504 --> 01:51:22.146]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time audio and video.
[01:51:22.566 --> 01:51:27.829]  The DigiNet Sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, on lawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings,
[01:51:28.109 --> 01:51:31.391]  Proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[01:51:31.772 --> 01:51:34.594]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[01:51:35.234 --> 01:51:39.217]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[01:51:39.718 --> 01:51:40.758]  Video never lies.
[01:51:41.219 --> 01:51:42.380]  Watch Big Brother back.

[01:51:44.681 --> 01:51:47.203]  That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.

[01:51:56.716 --> 01:52:06.085]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:06.805 --> 01:52:12.150]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:12.690 --> 01:52:18.856]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:19.176 --> 01:52:20.998]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:21.138 --> 01:52:23.540]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:23.620 --> 01:52:34.568]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:52:36.810 --> 01:52:38.111]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:38.471 --> 01:52:39.873]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:40.333 --> 01:52:46.558]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:47.225 --> 01:52:55.001]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:55.503 --> 01:52:56.645]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:57.086 --> 01:52:58.288]  The people strike back!
[01:53:00.319 --> 01:53:01.980]  We all need to prepare ourselves.
[01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:06.983]  You might have the food, water, gold, and silver, but ask yourself, are you truly prepared?
[01:53:07.404 --> 01:53:09.845]  That's why you need to visit MaineMilitary.com.

[01:53:49.248 --> 01:53:49.508]  That's 1-877-608-0179.
[01:54:07.398 --> 01:54:09.379]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:09.399 --> 01:54:17.902]  Remember, if you missed any of the program, the rebroadcast begins in about six minutes, and you can pick up the podcast only at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:17.982 --> 01:54:22.563]  Joining us live from Hardin, Montana, boots on the ground, Alex Jones.
[01:54:22.663 --> 01:54:22.923]  Alex?
[01:54:24.664 --> 01:54:28.045]  Yes, Barnabas, I will be live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:54:28.085 --> 01:54:31.586]  Central, and I'll give people a boil-down of everything we've witnessed here.
[01:54:31.606 --> 01:54:36.248]  We'll also get the latest flu information, a lot of other important, informative guests coming up next week.
[01:54:36.673 --> 01:54:41.856]  You're going to interview Peter Dale Scott today for your upcoming film that I'm very, very excited about.
[01:54:41.916 --> 01:54:48.319]  So that is some great work that you're doing there, Jason, on the Invisible Empire documentary.
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:55:04.128]  Before I finish up with Herr Hilton and what's happening here in Arden, Montana, I wanted to just encourage listeners to understand that we're running out of time.
[01:55:04.188 --> 01:55:05.369]  The tyranny is taking over.
[01:55:05.836 --> 01:55:12.686]  They use economically depressed areas and countries so the people can't stand up or take care of themselves, just like what's happening here in Arden.
[01:55:13.086 --> 01:55:14.929]  We need to show who the criminal bankers are.
[01:55:14.949 --> 01:55:21.058]  We need to identify them as the real shadow government that is the source of all of this tyranny and most of our problems.
[01:55:21.696 --> 01:55:23.077]  And that's what Fall Republic does.
[01:55:23.157 --> 01:55:28.180]  It shows how they use the TV for mind control, the police state, how they're turning everybody into Stasi spies.
[01:55:28.641 --> 01:55:29.841]  It really is my greatest work.
[01:55:29.882 --> 01:55:32.423]  And if you want to get it first, pre-order it now.
[01:55:32.443 --> 01:55:34.785]  It's going to be shipping in about 19 days or so.
[01:55:34.845 --> 01:55:36.326]  It comes out the 21st of October.
[01:55:36.666 --> 01:55:38.407]  It'll be at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:55:38.747 --> 01:55:43.330]  If you let your PrisonPlanet.TV membership lapse or never tried one, we've updated the site.
[01:55:43.351 --> 01:55:44.111]  We've made it even better.
[01:55:44.131 --> 01:55:45.612]  It's five and a half years up and running.
[01:55:45.952 --> 01:55:49.915]  All my films, the live TV show, my book, Paul Watson's book, so much more.
[01:55:49.995 --> 01:55:51.496]  Expanded extras from all the films.
[01:55:51.899 --> 01:55:53.837]  PresentPlanet.tv or order!
[01:55:54.372 --> 01:55:59.514]  Fall of the Republic today, so you get the DVD with all the extras first in the highest quality.
[01:55:59.834 --> 01:56:04.136]  Again, Fall of the Republic, available at InfoWars.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:56:04.956 --> 01:56:08.737]  I'm so excited about Fall of the Republic.
[01:56:08.757 --> 01:56:17.200]  I want this to be as viral or more than Obama Deception, and that is up to you, the great listeners that got the DVD of the Obama Deception and made those copies and got out to everybody.
[01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:18.641]  I've got a bunch of locals here.
[01:56:18.681 --> 01:56:20.742]  More than half the town knows me and likes me.
[01:56:20.982 --> 01:56:21.842]  I walk down the street,
[01:56:22.406 --> 01:56:23.067]  We're good to go.
[01:56:37.955 --> 01:56:38.455]  We're good.
[01:56:58.286 --> 01:56:58.666]  I think so.
[01:57:13.812 --> 01:57:15.793]  If our country wasn't so corrupt.
[01:57:15.813 --> 01:57:20.175]  This happened because these little towns and the big cities alike, corruption has set in.
[01:57:20.455 --> 01:57:23.476]  Boss hogs, thugs have taken over government everywhere.
[01:57:23.496 --> 01:57:28.078]  They feed and predicate like predators on the local populations.
[01:57:28.478 --> 01:57:30.159]  And that is definitely what's happening here.
[01:57:30.259 --> 01:57:39.143]  Any way you slice it, this is a mafioso takeover with a big prison to further suck the blood out of the local people that can't stand up for themselves.
[01:57:39.203 --> 01:57:41.604]  That's what the government is, is a giant parasitic
[01:57:43.524 --> 01:57:46.065]  Absolutely, and it continues to expand its power.
[01:57:46.125 --> 01:57:54.226]  I mean, I can't even recognize this country anymore when we're saying it's okay to have foreign mercenaries run our police forces, Alex.
[01:57:54.246 --> 01:57:55.866]  I mean, we've had callers... That's my final point!
[01:57:56.887 --> 01:58:03.348]  The leadership of the town, we went to the Sheriff's Office, wouldn't talk to us, but others, people at the Sheriff's Department and others said, look, we like it.
[01:58:03.628 --> 01:58:04.948]  We don't mind if he's a foreigner.
[01:58:04.968 --> 01:58:05.668]  We want you.
[01:58:05.688 --> 01:58:06.828]  You're not from here.
[01:58:06.908 --> 01:58:07.629]  You need to leave.
[01:58:07.649 --> 01:58:09.689]  So they said, we like foreign serves.
[01:58:11.342 --> 01:58:12.443]  But we don't like U.S.
[01:58:12.463 --> 01:58:15.205]  citizens from Texas, but that's the small minority.
[01:58:15.425 --> 01:58:19.188]  The boss hogs just love this Hilton guy because he fits right in with them.
[01:58:20.068 --> 01:58:30.775]  Absolutely, and if you missed any of this ever-important program, you need to listen to the rebroadcast or hit the podcast over at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[01:58:31.015 --> 01:58:31.856]  God bless you all.
[01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:45.005]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:47.908 --> 01:58:48.969]  Radio Network.
[01:58:49.510 --> 01:58:52.432]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:58:52.893 --> 01:58:56.076]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:58:56.516 --> 01:59:00.880]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:05.244]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:59:05.645 --> 01:59:10.269]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces...
