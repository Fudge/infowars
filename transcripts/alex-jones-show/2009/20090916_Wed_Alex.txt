[00:00:00.423 --> 00:00:02.722]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:13.166]  We are simulcasting here in the last two hours at PrisonPlanet.TV when the syndicated radio transmission becomes living color.
[00:00:13.586 --> 00:00:17.248]  Internet transmission television at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.750]  We're going to go to Robert Galen Ross Sr.
[00:00:21.311 --> 00:00:22.832]  here in just a moment live in studio.
[00:00:22.852 --> 00:00:30.236]  He'll be with us about 20 minutes into the next hour and later in the hour we're going to open the phones up for any issue you want to discuss.
[00:00:31.096 --> 00:00:36.199]  He's a generalist, kind of like myself, has a lot of knowledge about a lot of things dealing with the New World Order.
[00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.400]  He's also an author and filmmaker.
[00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:40.361]  So Robert Galen Ross Sr.
[00:00:40.442 --> 00:00:42.563]  in studio with us coming up here in just a moment.
[00:00:42.923 --> 00:00:44.244]  I want to tell you about a new sponsor.
[00:00:45.202 --> 00:00:47.165]  We've had some medical doctors on who've talked about this.
[00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:53.253]  With viruses and bacteria, colloidal silver, the smaller the better, really does help.
[00:00:54.115 --> 00:01:00.363]  And a lot of medical doctors talked about if there was a way to inhale it, that that would be a great way to deal with infection and other things.
[00:01:00.724 --> 00:01:01.845]  You can find out more.
[00:01:02.927 --> 00:01:07.130]  And the testimonials and the medical info, because I don't even pretend to understand all this stuff.
[00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.991]  It's silverlungs.com.
[00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:11.893]  S-I-L-V-E-R, lungs.
[00:01:11.993 --> 00:01:13.354]  Silverlungs.com.
[00:01:14.014 --> 00:01:17.036]  It's a highly cost-effective cloyal silver generator.
[00:01:17.396 --> 00:01:18.717]  Yeah, it's its own generator system.
[00:01:18.757 --> 00:01:19.258]  Really nice.
[00:01:20.078 --> 00:01:25.563]  Uh, and lung delivery system that produces pure and endless colloidal silver delivers the solution directly into the blood.
[00:01:25.983 --> 00:01:29.827]  Never before has making high quality colloidal silver been this easy and this effective.
[00:01:29.847 --> 00:01:30.908]  It really is a neat system.
[00:01:31.288 --> 00:01:32.529]  Silver lungs.
[00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:34.711]  As in plural, you got two lungs.
[00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:36.072]  Silverlungs.com.
[00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:40.528]  One other sponsor I wanted to let you know about is a Coloblue.
[00:01:40.948 --> 00:01:43.269]  That's the atmospheric water generator.
[00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:49.592]  It grabs water out of the air, that's what clouds are, and sends them through a seven-stage filter system.
[00:01:49.892 --> 00:01:57.556]  Reverse osmosis, carbon, UV, stores it in a stainless steel tank, has its own little computer readout.
[00:01:58.096 --> 00:02:00.857]  They have smaller systems that do seven and a half gallons a day.
[00:02:00.877 --> 00:02:03.739]  It looks like a water cooler without the water cooler on top.
[00:02:05.023 --> 00:02:06.684]  acolablue.com.
[00:02:06.864 --> 00:02:08.505]  E-C-O-L-O, blue.
[00:02:08.665 --> 00:02:09.725]  acolablue.com.
[00:02:09.745 --> 00:02:13.107]  Big banners up on infowars.com or give them a call, ask for a brochure.
[00:02:13.927 --> 00:02:18.529]  They have systems for solar power to be hooked up to it.
[00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.390]  acolablue.com or 800-691-6043.
[00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.810]  800-691-6043. acolablue.com.
[00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.471]  And remember, our sponsors also make this radio show possible.
[00:02:30.808 --> 00:02:33.951]  Okay, who is Robert Galen Sr.?
[00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:39.095]  Well, he's born in Big Lake, Texas and holds a BS degree in industrial engineering from Texas A&M University.
[00:02:39.455 --> 00:02:45.580]  While active in engineering, he was licensed professional engineer in the state of Texas and national certified manufacturing engineer.
[00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:52.666]  After graduation, he accepted the commission of the second lieutenant, later promoted to first lieutenant in the Army Security Agency, a branch of the NSA.
[00:02:53.487 --> 00:03:11.685]  Which is a big brother of the Central Intelligence Agency, military training, was in the field of crypto analysis, the breaking of codes, and he served as a company commander with the intelligence unit on the Demilitarized Zone, DMZ, in the valley of South Korea from 56-57 after fighting had ceased.
[00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:12.605]  Upon leaving,
[00:03:13.584 --> 00:03:13.764]  I think?
[00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:48.082]  Contacted a number of publishers and again went ahead and self-published and now has RIE, his own publishing company, and 4rie.com is the website.
[00:03:48.422 --> 00:03:50.543]  Robert Galen Ross, great to have you here in studio with us.
[00:03:53.544 --> 00:03:56.045]  It's fantastic having you here with us as well.
[00:03:56.565 --> 00:03:58.346]  Okay, just in a nutshell.
[00:03:59.542 --> 00:04:01.663]  Let's talk about how the banking system works.
[00:04:01.763 --> 00:04:02.583]  Fiat banking.
[00:04:02.663 --> 00:04:03.683]  Some of your books cover that.
[00:04:03.703 --> 00:04:05.904]  We carry them at Infowars.com.
[00:04:06.344 --> 00:04:07.885]  Kind of dovetail it with your other work.
[00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:09.885]  The murder of JFK, RFK, MLK.
[00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:11.106]  How they murder people.
[00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:14.287]  We've had four big CEOs killed in the last 48 hours.
[00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:17.728]  The head of the Rockefeller family's corporation was clearly murdered.
[00:04:18.568 --> 00:04:20.889]  And then, what their master plan is.
[00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:26.651]  If they're able to bankrupt the planet and bring this system in, if they're truly able to be successful,
[00:04:28.594 --> 00:04:30.495]  We know world government's just the beginning.
[00:04:30.955 --> 00:04:34.017]  What will the world look like if they were able to get everything they wanted?
[00:04:34.397 --> 00:04:35.958]  So good to have you here with us.
[00:04:35.978 --> 00:04:36.818]  I appreciate that.
[00:04:37.578 --> 00:04:54.967]  What their goal is, is to create the New World Order, or the Global Union, and once they do that, it'll be sort of like in the medieval time, when the kings would live in their castles and
[00:04:56.103 --> 00:05:04.805]  In order to visit their friends in the other castle, they'd have to have an army to escort them to the next castle because the peasants were out to get them.
[00:05:05.985 --> 00:05:11.287]  And we're going to end up with kings and paupers all around the world.
[00:05:12.587 --> 00:05:14.587]  And there won't be any middle class people there.
[00:05:14.627 --> 00:05:16.328]  They're going to eliminate the middle class.
[00:05:17.408 --> 00:05:21.569]  But in order to stop this, I've in my book, I have
[00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:27.143]  Uh, set up a timeline for stopping them.
[00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:33.186]  Uh, and the first thing is we need to, uh, correct our voting system.
[00:05:33.586 --> 00:05:35.807]  We all know that our voting system is corrupt.
[00:05:36.848 --> 00:05:46.953]  Uh, and so once we straighten that out, and the only way to do that is to go to a paper ballot, uh, counted by, uh, members of the local community.
[00:05:47.862 --> 00:06:01.547]  And once the count is made, then it must be posted in local newspaper before it ever goes to Washington or wherever, so that they can't juggle the numbers once the results are finished.
[00:06:01.827 --> 00:06:10.671]  And we've got you for over an hour, so I want to get into that in the second part, get into solutions, get into your new book, hot off the presses, what the elite
[00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.710]  Yes.
[00:06:32.382 --> 00:06:48.450]  And then currently your take on, because you're right, the Club of Rome is brags, CFR brags, they want to bring in neo-feudalism, neo-serfdom, they want to bankrupt the world, they want to go to a post-industrial system where the armored government compounds in the countryside
[00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.331]  are where the elites live.
[00:06:50.551 --> 00:06:52.593]  They will have life extension technologies.
[00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:54.375]  They will have access to high tech.
[00:06:54.775 --> 00:07:05.265]  We are going to be put into a level of squalor, degradation, one-child policies, really kind of roving government systems that keep us in check and the orderly extermination.
[00:07:05.766 --> 00:07:11.852]  But specifically, how these banking families got their control and what their master plan is.
[00:07:12.452 --> 00:07:15.735]  Yeah, they've developed techniques in their money science.
[00:07:16.415 --> 00:07:19.077]  For example, the reserve system.
[00:07:20.218 --> 00:07:27.043]  A bank is required to keep 10% of their capital in reserve, and then they can loan out 90%.
[00:07:27.123 --> 00:07:32.527]  So let's say that you deposit $1,000 in a local bank.
[00:07:33.168 --> 00:07:36.110]  They can turn around and loan out $900 of that to someone else.
[00:07:38.903 --> 00:07:48.445]  And let's say they loan it to Joe, and Joe immediately puts into his checking account or savings account, then they can loan out 90% of that.
[00:07:49.165 --> 00:07:56.447]  So as this keeps going from one to another, $1,000 can create $9,000 in new money.
[00:07:57.407 --> 00:07:58.987]  And that's the fractional reserve system.
[00:07:59.428 --> 00:08:05.949]  And it's done so that they can loan this money out at interest.
[00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:10.712]  Continue breaking that down for people.
[00:08:10.772 --> 00:08:20.559]  I mean, in layman's terms, they get the license from the government, the authorization to just be able to make up money, make up liquidity, and then they buy up their own assets.
[00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:23.301]  They buy up products and industries.
[00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:29.705]  And then they got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act of 99 that allowed investment banks to become normal retail banks.
[00:08:30.045 --> 00:08:38.831]  And so they just directly gave themselves unlimited money and broke free of the chains of just the fractional reserve banking that already allowed them to take over the economy.
[00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:40.271]  That's correct.
[00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:44.252]  And the Federal Reserve creates money out of thin air.
[00:08:44.272 --> 00:08:52.354]  And most of the money they create is done by electronic means, by just a computer entry into their database.
[00:08:52.374 --> 00:08:53.654]  And if they print new money,
[00:09:05.456 --> 00:09:11.759]  It costs somewhere around $35,000 for a pallet load of, say, $100 bills.
[00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:13.300]  That's all it costs them.
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.542]  But that pallet load may contain $5 billion worth of money.
[00:09:18.419 --> 00:09:21.780]  So the cost of printing the money is nothing to him.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.681]  I've talked to economists because they haven't published these in about a decade.
[00:09:24.982 --> 00:09:38.587]  A decade ago, for every billion dollars of fiat currency on the computer books, well there's roughly 3% paper money or coin money for every dollar that's out there.
[00:09:38.827 --> 00:09:42.848]  But I've been told it's even less than that, down to about 1% right now.
[00:09:43.409 --> 00:09:46.970]  So it's not just the print money, it's just all this fiat made-up money.
[00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.491]  Yeah, it's the electronic money.
[00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:52.173]  That's most of the M3 money supply.
[00:09:52.273 --> 00:09:53.053]  It's made up money.
[00:09:53.674 --> 00:09:54.894]  Made up out of thin air.
[00:09:55.535 --> 00:09:56.575]  Loaned out of an interest.
[00:09:57.296 --> 00:09:59.137]  So people will kill each other.
[00:09:59.437 --> 00:10:00.698]  People will cheat their parents.
[00:10:00.778 --> 00:10:03.439]  People will do anything for some Federal Reserve notes.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:10.643]  And it's all just made out of nothing for a handful of private families to be able to literally own the planet.
[00:10:10.824 --> 00:10:11.224]  That's right.
[00:10:12.283 --> 00:10:15.008]  And then you have somebody like Bernie Madoff.
[00:10:15.068 --> 00:10:18.515]  He really soaked his own friends.
[00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:21.601]  He took all their money and said he was going to invest it.
[00:10:22.572 --> 00:10:32.296]  And it turned out he didn't invest any of it, and it was a Ponzi scheme where he paid the dividends of his customers off the money of other people.
[00:10:32.416 --> 00:10:40.659]  And he got up to something like $65 billion he loaned out, and of course now he's spent 150 years in prison for doing that.
[00:10:40.719 --> 00:10:42.920]  Well, and he created the Nasdaq.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:50.943]  I mean, this is one of the high-level guys, and it's been reported that the same stuff he's doing, that all these major firms do this.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:11:00.465]  But if you look at the derivatives and credit default swaps, that is a Ponzi scheme in itself.
[00:11:01.405 --> 00:11:11.071]  And in my book, I give the amount of derivatives and credit default swaps that each bank owns, the largest ones.
[00:11:11.091 --> 00:11:13.892]  Webster Tarpley says it's 1.5 quadrillion.
[00:11:13.932 --> 00:11:15.673]  Is that accurate?
[00:11:16.153 --> 00:11:17.534]  That's total derivatives, yes.
[00:11:20.058 --> 00:11:21.019]  The banks don't have that.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.943]  They have about one-fiftieth of that in assets.
[00:11:25.823 --> 00:11:42.638]  For example, the JPMorgan Chase Bank has a little over $1 trillion in total capitalization, and they've got 54 times that outstanding in derivatives.
[00:11:43.513 --> 00:11:44.814]  So that's a Ponzi scheme.
[00:11:45.214 --> 00:11:46.015]  We've got a break.
[00:11:46.055 --> 00:11:49.417]  Let's come back and talk about what their master plan is, because they're bragging.
[00:11:49.457 --> 00:11:52.939]  They want a new bank of the world out of all this, out of the crisis they created.
[00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:55.041]  Then we'll talk about solutions with our guest.
[00:11:55.101 --> 00:11:58.703]  When looking at your personal preparedness level, remember the freeze-dried guy.
[00:11:58.823 --> 00:12:05.748]  During times of physical and emotional stress, like the uncertain times we live in today, it is vital that you not alter your diet too much.
[00:12:05.988 --> 00:12:07.909]  You should only store what you usually eat,
[00:12:08.149 --> 00:12:11.030]  Because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored.
[00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.210]  Lucky for you, there's the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:19.652]  Featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect, the Freeze-Dry Guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods.
[00:12:19.852 --> 00:12:24.613]  All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time.
[00:12:24.814 --> 00:12:33.016]  The Freeze-Dry Guy has been serving various government agencies as well as the private sector with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[00:12:34.116 --> 00:12:40.822]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today.
[00:12:41.002 --> 00:12:45.807]  Comparably, the advances made in food storage from the World War II era till now are equally great.
[00:12:46.027 --> 00:12:50.871]  Visit the website at www.freezdryguy.com or call toll-free 866-404-3663.
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.364]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:12:59.784 --> 00:13:05.209]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.751]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:13:06.771 --> 00:13:10.815]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:13:11.475 --> 00:13:24.802]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:13:25.282 --> 00:13:30.585]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:13:30.885 --> 00:13:36.768]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:13:37.528 --> 00:13:39.329]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:40.369 --> 00:13:43.591]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:47.232]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:47.653 --> 00:13:50.494]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:13:50.514 --> 00:13:50.754]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:50.794 --> 00:13:56.957]  It is a big idea.
[00:13:56.977 --> 00:13:59.078]  A new world order.
[00:13:59.798 --> 00:14:04.060]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:14:04.671 --> 00:14:06.794]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:14:07.494 --> 00:14:09.737]  Put their objective being world domination.
[00:14:10.298 --> 00:14:12.741]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:14:13.481 --> 00:14:20.790]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:14:23.823 --> 00:14:28.785]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:14:29.245 --> 00:14:32.746]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:14:32.866 --> 00:14:35.607]  Global Parity is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:14:35.687 --> 00:14:36.847]  Most people have no idea.
[00:14:36.867 --> 00:14:37.627]  They're not after money.
[00:14:37.647 --> 00:14:38.727]  They have all the money they need.
[00:14:38.928 --> 00:14:39.668]  They're after power.
[00:14:39.888 --> 00:14:40.768]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:14:50.511 --> 00:14:52.232]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:14:52.572 --> 00:14:53.612]  You have been warned.
[00:14:54.591 --> 00:14:59.935]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[00:15:00.475 --> 00:15:05.119]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[00:15:05.599 --> 00:15:06.240]  That was then.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.481]  This is now.
[00:15:08.121 --> 00:15:10.303]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[00:15:10.823 --> 00:15:16.489]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time audio and video.
[00:15:16.889 --> 00:15:25.738]  The DigiNet sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, on lawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings, proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[00:15:26.118 --> 00:15:28.861]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:33.542]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.

[00:15:46.746 --> 00:15:46.946]  1-888-344-6681 today.
[00:16:01.744 --> 00:16:04.105]  Robert Galen Ross is our guest in studio.
[00:16:04.125 --> 00:16:05.846]  He'll be with us 20 minutes to the next hour.
[00:16:05.866 --> 00:16:06.887]  We're going to have open phones.
[00:16:07.627 --> 00:16:10.448]  Also, the mainstream media has chickened out.
[00:16:10.609 --> 00:16:13.590]  They're not responding to Charlie Sheen's challenge to a debate.
[00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:20.294]  They want to just sit up there and misrepresent what he said about 9-11.
[00:16:21.906 --> 00:16:24.269]  I got a pretty hot text message from Charlie earlier today.
[00:16:24.329 --> 00:16:26.091]  He is just sick and tired of these cowards.
[00:16:26.891 --> 00:16:27.953]  I was talking to the guys.
[00:16:27.973 --> 00:16:33.198]  They were saying TMZ covered Charlie going in to have dinner the other night with Buzz Aldrin.
[00:16:33.679 --> 00:16:35.901]  Charlie calls him and says, hey, one of my friends knows Buzz Aldrin.
[00:16:35.921 --> 00:16:36.702]  I'm going to dinner with him.
[00:16:36.982 --> 00:16:39.265]  And then Charlie goes to dinner and becomes a news item.
[00:16:39.785 --> 00:16:40.506]  That's something else.
[00:16:40.626 --> 00:16:41.687]  So maybe cue that up.
[00:16:41.707 --> 00:16:43.229]  Maybe after Galen leaves us, we'll...
[00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.491]  We'll play that if you can find it.
[00:16:46.031 --> 00:16:48.652]  What the elite have done to America and how to fix it.
[00:16:49.212 --> 00:16:52.814]  Robert Galen Ross Sr., this is a short segment, but long segment coming up.
[00:16:52.834 --> 00:16:54.154]  We'll get more into the book after that.
[00:16:54.214 --> 00:16:57.015]  But getting into the bankers, what makes them tick?
[00:16:57.156 --> 00:16:58.296]  What is their world plan?
[00:16:58.676 --> 00:16:59.877]  We know they're eugenicists.
[00:16:59.897 --> 00:17:01.117]  We know it's come out the White House.
[00:17:01.157 --> 00:17:07.480]  Science Czar admits they want a cold world population, that they want a world government to carry that out.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.341]  What will the planet look like if we're unable to stop these people?
[00:17:13.194 --> 00:17:25.382]  It'll just be less than 1% of the super wealthy, and the rest of us will be peons, from normal peons down to sub-peons.
[00:17:26.483 --> 00:17:36.009]  And there'll be one money, one monetary system, one around the world, all controlled probably out of Brussels.
[00:17:37.249 --> 00:17:42.633]  And the Rothschilds keep their money in Switzerland.
[00:17:43.484 --> 00:17:45.985]  So that nobody can ever find out what they really have.
[00:17:47.585 --> 00:17:52.166]  And you notice that they've only been selectively taking the bank accounts of people with like a million bucks.
[00:17:52.526 --> 00:18:03.628]  They're taking the low-level nobody's money out of these offshore corporations when it's admitted the Rockefellers have more than 10,000 shell corporations just in the Bahamas and the Caymans alone.
[00:18:03.948 --> 00:18:04.388]  That's right.
[00:18:05.368 --> 00:18:10.029]  But no one touches the Rothschilds' or the Rockefellers' money.
[00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:12.330]  No one will report on it.
[00:18:14.039 --> 00:18:19.502]  It's suicide to really get into any details on Rockefeller's and Rothschild's.
[00:18:19.703 --> 00:18:20.823]  Well, it is suicide.
[00:18:21.204 --> 00:18:24.906]  I'm always reading about Rockefeller secretaries, Rockefeller CEOs.
[00:18:25.466 --> 00:18:28.148]  If somebody in an oil company doesn't do what they're told, they commit suicide.
[00:18:28.188 --> 00:18:29.249]  Shotgun in the back of the head.
[00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:32.551]  Rockefeller Company CEO committed suicide.
[00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:35.373]  James McDonald shot himself in the head yesterday.
[00:18:36.093 --> 00:18:37.094]  Probably in the back of the head.
[00:18:42.267 --> 00:18:43.288]  Double Barrel Shotgun.
[00:19:00.804 --> 00:19:07.405]  Uh, the elite own or control all news media except radio, of course.
[00:19:07.425 --> 00:19:12.026]  Yeah, a few handful of radio shows and internet, which Jay Rockefeller admits they want to shut down.
[00:19:12.546 --> 00:19:12.846]  Oh yeah.
[00:19:13.586 --> 00:19:16.487]  Uh, and eventually they'll try to control the internet.
[00:19:17.187 --> 00:19:25.308]  And the internet is one, and talk radio is our last sources of real facts about what's going on in the world.
[00:19:25.868 --> 00:19:28.589]  And they'll naturally have to shut all that down.
[00:19:29.437 --> 00:19:37.705]  Yeah, the White House Diversity Czar at the FCC said, we need to look at what Hugo Chavez has done with his media fairness.
[00:19:38.445 --> 00:19:38.605]  Right.
[00:19:38.645 --> 00:19:43.870]  And Chavez, I mean I'm glad he defeated the expansion of North American Free Trade of America's area.
[00:19:45.712 --> 00:19:48.194]  I mean, I'm glad he helped shoot down the free trade area of the Americas.
[00:19:49.015 --> 00:19:55.641]  But now they're creating a socialist model of that, and Chavez is shutting down free speech in Venezuela.
[00:19:56.451 --> 00:20:04.537]  Well, yeah, but if you look at the net effect of Chavez, he has stopped the creation of the American Union.
[00:20:05.178 --> 00:20:06.078]  Single-handedly.
[00:20:06.599 --> 00:20:07.660]  So you like Chavez?
[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:15.505]  Well, I like most of what he does because he's trying to get in the way of the creation of the global union.
[00:20:15.886 --> 00:20:18.848]  And he's been very successful in all of South America.
[00:20:20.209 --> 00:20:23.331]  And people wonder why he associates with
[00:20:24.998 --> 00:20:29.942]  Uh, Qaddafi and, uh, uh, Ahmadinejad and some of the others.
[00:20:30.142 --> 00:20:35.426]  Well, hell, that's the only people out there available that'll talk to him, so why not?
[00:20:38.041 --> 00:20:41.963]  Well, I mean, Gaddafi was the big boogeyman, but now he's a darling of the West.
[00:20:42.683 --> 00:20:43.804]  So they do the same thing.
[00:20:43.824 --> 00:20:46.005]  Saddam's our buddy one day, he's evil the next.
[00:20:46.385 --> 00:20:49.006]  Bin Laden's a hero one day, next day he attacked us.
[00:20:49.627 --> 00:20:55.750]  So, I mean, certainly, I just really do see him clamping down on the media and free speech and trying to stay in power.
[00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.311]  I mean, I see him as another Fidel Castro.
[00:20:58.651 --> 00:21:01.292]  But I do like what he did to the free trade area of the Americas.
[00:21:01.332 --> 00:21:02.413]  I mean, he did help kill that.
[00:21:02.873 --> 00:21:18.216]  Well, and he also set up the Bank of the South, which is the central bank of all of South America, owned by the South American nations, funded by Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela.
[00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:28.244]  And they loan money to other nations of Latin America at very low interest rates so they can pay off their loans to the IMF and the World Bank.
[00:21:29.104 --> 00:21:31.106]  Who charge 30% compounded.
[00:21:31.126 --> 00:21:32.206]  That's right.
[00:21:32.727 --> 00:21:39.751]  Let's finish up with Chavez, fractional reserve banking, the elite master plan, and then how to fix it from your perspective.
[00:21:39.771 --> 00:21:43.594]  Robert Galen Ross, author, researcher, is our guest in studio.
[00:21:45.615 --> 00:21:46.496]  We're on the march.
[00:21:46.996 --> 00:21:48.497]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:49.526 --> 00:21:52.308]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:58.632]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:21:58.892 --> 00:22:00.673]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:22:00.894 --> 00:22:09.179]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:22:09.419 --> 00:22:14.563]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:22:14.903 --> 00:22:16.524]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:22:16.744 --> 00:22:23.065]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:22:23.265 --> 00:22:34.008]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:22:34.308 --> 00:22:34.828]  That's right.
[00:22:35.088 --> 00:22:37.408]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[00:22:41.809 --> 00:22:59.718]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:22:59.838 --> 00:23:01.798]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:23:01.919 --> 00:23:04.200]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.221]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:23:06.641 --> 00:23:08.001]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:23:08.261 --> 00:23:09.302]  There is a solution.
[00:23:09.542 --> 00:23:17.544]  InterHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:23:57.616 --> 00:24:02.998]  No other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds and oil of the hemp plant.

[00:24:19.792 --> 00:24:22.034]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[00:24:49.677 --> 00:24:50.837]  I wish a buck was still silver
[00:25:14.752 --> 00:25:21.974]  But we have allowed private interest to take control of our banking system and our government.
[00:25:24.115 --> 00:25:26.655]  And they have looted and robbed us blind.
[00:25:26.695 --> 00:25:31.317]  They have set up a world government to take over other nations using our funds and capital.
[00:25:32.372 --> 00:25:37.636]  They have used our name and our flag as their banner of all of their evil actions.
[00:25:38.096 --> 00:25:39.557]  And now we're hated the world over.
[00:25:40.198 --> 00:25:43.380]  They put in this Hollywood president to try to fool people.
[00:25:44.778 --> 00:25:50.420]  Robert, Galen Ross, Barack Obama, give me your take on him and then whether or not you think this is it.
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.561]  Are they really getting ready to kill the dollar?
[00:25:52.961 --> 00:26:05.885]  All these big announcements from top economists how the dollar is going to die, we're going to be like Argentina, trying to destroy confidence, trying to drive us into accepting, you know, oh the bankers will fix it if you just do what they say.
[00:26:06.245 --> 00:26:08.546]  They've got a global government, a global carbon tax.
[00:26:09.026 --> 00:26:10.527]  All the stuff we got laughed at
[00:26:12.324 --> 00:26:27.570]  Well, I've got a chapter on what I call elite spies within our government, and Obama is surrounded by members of the elite, just like every president since Wilson.
[00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:33.112]  All of his top advisors are members of Bilderberg's Council of Foreign Relations Trilateral Commission.
[00:26:33.552 --> 00:26:39.834]  So nothing's really going to change in the creation of the New World Order or the Global Union.
[00:26:41.079 --> 00:26:54.772]  And he's certainly a very articulate, intelligent person, but I don't think you ever get into that position unless you sell your soul to Lucifer.
[00:26:55.532 --> 00:27:03.840]  And it's so simple, and people get caught up, and in four years when they put a Republican in, we're going to have to argue with these idiots that, hey, this is another puppet.
[00:27:05.805 --> 00:27:09.607]  What's your take on what's developing with the dollar from your research?
[00:27:10.047 --> 00:27:15.889]  Well, I've got a graph in my book that shows the effects of money supply.
[00:27:15.989 --> 00:27:22.512]  And for the last 30, 40 years, it's been fairly flat, the M3 money supply.
[00:27:23.393 --> 00:27:27.734]  And in the last year, it's gone up something like 200%.
[00:27:28.015 --> 00:27:33.617]  And so when the money supply goes up,
[00:27:34.508 --> 00:27:38.632]  That means that we're into hyperinflation.
[00:27:39.713 --> 00:27:43.676]  We'll be like Zimbabwe and Argentina.
[00:27:44.497 --> 00:27:51.684]  Zimbabwe, you have to take a wheelbarrow full of money to the grocery store to buy a loaf of bread.
[00:27:52.284 --> 00:27:53.886]  We're going to end up in that same road.
[00:27:55.707 --> 00:28:00.051]  Right now, our largest paper dollar or paper bill is $100 bill.
[00:28:01.866 --> 00:28:03.731]  Within two or three years, it could be a $10,000 bill.
[00:28:06.004 --> 00:28:08.866]  That's what happened to Argentina and to Zimbabwe.
[00:28:09.146 --> 00:28:12.849]  And the establishment knows all of this is going to be rolled out in phases.
[00:28:13.289 --> 00:28:23.015]  That's why they openly admit NORTHCOM and Homeland Security and the Patriot Act is for the Anti-Federal Reserve protesters, for the veterans, for the gun owners.
[00:28:23.616 --> 00:28:31.941]  And so again, they built this thing in the name of fighting Al-Qaeda, but the whole time it was meant for us because they know we're not going to like becoming third world slaves.
[00:28:32.982 --> 00:28:44.968]  I saw a piece on my computer a couple weeks ago about a British general that the reporter asked him how many Al-Qaeda have y'all killed?
[00:28:45.389 --> 00:28:46.649]  He says zero.
[00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:49.391]  He says how many Al-Qaeda are trying to
[00:28:52.961 --> 00:28:56.424]  They put us under and he says zero, there is no such thing as Al Qaeda.
[00:28:56.444 --> 00:29:00.947]  That's a term that they invented to create something to fight.
[00:29:01.548 --> 00:29:05.571]  Now they are Taliban and... By the way the Pentagon admits that.
[00:29:05.611 --> 00:29:12.896]  They say it was the name of the computer program in 79 to recruit and name all the Mujahideen working for the CIA.
[00:29:13.277 --> 00:29:13.457]  Right.
[00:29:14.412 --> 00:29:18.474]  And we would create all that problem in Afghanistan to try to run the Russians out.
[00:29:18.735 --> 00:29:23.317]  And then when we finally got the Russians out, then these people turned on us.
[00:29:23.377 --> 00:29:28.901]  There's been a 13-fold now, it grows, of any record of opium production.
[00:29:28.961 --> 00:29:30.181]  Heroin is everywhere now.
[00:29:30.642 --> 00:29:33.163]  And the BBC just admits, well, the U.S.
[00:29:33.203 --> 00:29:35.865]  and the British, we have to guard the opium or the Taliban will get it.
[00:29:36.205 --> 00:29:37.666]  The Taliban is there guarding it.
[00:29:38.246 --> 00:29:39.227]  We're shipping it out.
[00:29:39.887 --> 00:29:42.928]  It was, I mean, was it over oil or was it more over opium?
[00:29:43.268 --> 00:29:45.108]  It was over two reasons.
[00:29:45.308 --> 00:29:46.808]  Afghanistan for two reasons.
[00:29:47.388 --> 00:29:59.671]  Number one, they needed to create a 48-inch gas pipeline and oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea area down to a saltwater port south and also into China.
[00:30:00.291 --> 00:30:02.391]  And these had to go through Afghanistan.
[00:30:02.971 --> 00:30:04.852]  And the Taliban would not permit it.
[00:30:05.732 --> 00:30:07.192]  And then the second reason is
[00:30:09.969 --> 00:30:18.117]  The 90% of the opium in the world is created there in Afghanistan.
[00:30:18.437 --> 00:30:23.742]  And the Taliban, it's against their religion for their own people to consume it.
[00:30:23.762 --> 00:30:31.470]  And so the production of poppies was outlawed by the Taliban.
[00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:36.073]  And was headed to zero about the time we invaded Afghanistan.
[00:30:36.294 --> 00:30:39.076]  And from there on, it went back up to normal production.
[00:30:39.196 --> 00:30:57.351]  But just to be driving in my car, listening to XM a few months ago, I already knew all this, but to hear him admit it, BBC spun it like, well, US and British forces guard the poppies and production has gone up, because if we don't let the farmers grow it, the Taliban will take back control and they will sell it.
[00:30:58.132 --> 00:30:59.432]  And that's always the rationale.
[00:30:59.472 --> 00:31:02.433]  That's how the CIA got involved in narcotics when it was OSS.
[00:31:02.813 --> 00:31:04.594]  Well, if we don't, the Nazis will do it.
[00:31:05.314 --> 00:31:07.375]  And, no, the truth is, it's just the mafia.
[00:31:07.755 --> 00:31:08.155]  That's right.
[00:31:08.175 --> 00:31:11.396]  The Taliban is actually a mafia within Afghanistan.
[00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:17.678]  And they go around and control the farmers, and everything they do is controlled by the Taliban.
[00:31:20.526 --> 00:31:23.167]  Got me wanting to cough now, too.
[00:31:24.008 --> 00:31:26.449]  It's funny, one person coughs, the other feels like they've got to cough.
[00:31:26.469 --> 00:31:27.529]  It's just like a yawn.
[00:31:28.249 --> 00:31:28.950]  Absolutely.
[00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.471]  Hey, it would be nice to take a little snooze right now.
[00:31:31.511 --> 00:31:38.514]  We could just say nap time now and play some nice soft music for people.
[00:31:40.461 --> 00:31:44.006]  Robert, let's get into the master plan a little bit more and then into solutions.
[00:31:44.026 --> 00:31:44.587]  Okay.
[00:31:44.847 --> 00:31:47.430]  Studying this, what makes the globalists tick?
[00:31:47.871 --> 00:31:51.355]  Why do they enjoy doing horrible things to people?
[00:31:52.257 --> 00:31:54.399]  Why do they enjoy pushing eugenics?
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.604]  And what will the world look like if they're successful?
[00:31:58.393 --> 00:32:01.715]  Well, you're a great example.
[00:32:02.315 --> 00:32:04.777]  You've presented a great example of what they're like.
[00:32:04.857 --> 00:32:09.920]  You snuck into the Bohemian Grove and you videoed the ceremony.
[00:32:12.461 --> 00:32:23.267]  You've got some people that are involved in medieval thoughts, and this is done every day in their operations.
[00:32:23.307 --> 00:32:25.909]  They just happen to meet there in Bohemian Grove.
[00:32:27.407 --> 00:32:41.181]  I was really proud of you when you approached David Gergen and he said he dishonors you or something like that.
[00:32:41.221 --> 00:32:42.021]  He got mad, yeah.
[00:32:44.461 --> 00:32:45.341]  It takes people like you.
[00:32:45.822 --> 00:32:47.462]  Well, somebody had to do it.
[00:32:47.482 --> 00:32:51.984]  But the thing was, I didn't really believe they were doing that completely when I snuck in.
[00:32:52.044 --> 00:32:52.925]  I snuck in to see.
[00:32:53.745 --> 00:32:57.406]  And then I was sitting there watching the ritual and I thought, well, this maybe is like a play.
[00:32:58.087 --> 00:33:02.589]  But the old men around me were very agitated, breathing heavy.
[00:33:03.489 --> 00:33:10.512]  This was more religious than, you know, going to Baptist church growing up and holy rollers, getting really excited and praying.
[00:33:11.752 --> 00:33:15.733]  You know, getting wild, this was religious rapture.
[00:33:15.793 --> 00:33:19.834]  I mean, they were really into this at certain points.
[00:33:19.914 --> 00:33:21.594]  That was a formal ceremony.
[00:33:21.634 --> 00:33:23.355]  That was not a stage show.
[00:33:24.315 --> 00:33:31.877]  And that's just a micro example of what's going on throughout the world.
[00:33:31.957 --> 00:33:37.738]  And these people get involved in trafficking of drugs, trafficking of young children.
[00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:41.073]  Trafficking of women throughout the world.
[00:33:41.934 --> 00:33:45.738]  And it even comes out in Congress and Rumsfeld says they're not going to get in trouble.
[00:33:45.758 --> 00:33:47.020]  We're going to let DynCorp do it.
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.785]  And then anywhere you walk into an ACORN, you go, I got 12 year old sex slaves and they go, great.
[00:33:52.426 --> 00:33:54.609]  I mean, that's how mainstream this is.
[00:33:54.989 --> 00:34:02.014]  Yeah, and that was another great expose there where they snuck in or just walked in pretending to be a prostitute and a pimp.
[00:34:02.154 --> 00:34:11.920]  I've always told my listeners, get hidden cameras, go into any city council, any government group, any CPS, and these people are so lawless and so criminal.
[00:34:12.241 --> 00:34:17.104]  I mean, look, if you can steal kids with no due process all day, there's going to be something wrong with you.
[00:34:17.244 --> 00:34:17.684]  That's right.
[00:34:17.864 --> 00:34:22.547]  And I'm telling you, the few times I go to the Capitol, I catch bribery on tape.
[00:34:22.888 --> 00:34:24.389]  The government is so corrupt.
[00:34:25.009 --> 00:34:26.110]  It's like a rotten barn.
[00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:30.431]  You pull one plank off, there's termites anywhere you look.
[00:34:30.571 --> 00:34:33.153]  That's right.
[00:34:33.573 --> 00:34:40.116]  And they try to keep it under wraps, but every now and then it'll come out.
[00:34:40.736 --> 00:34:45.958]  But then they put a spin on it, saying, well, no, that must be fiction.
[00:34:46.238 --> 00:34:47.219]  That doesn't really happen.
[00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:48.039]  That's not us.
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.580]  But we know it is.
[00:34:50.711 --> 00:34:53.212]  Well, you've studied societies, how they go into these cycles.
[00:34:53.933 --> 00:34:55.874]  We're clearly going into a very decadent cycle.
[00:34:55.894 --> 00:35:07.760]  Can you describe what you, from your deep research and the other experts you talked to in an interview for your book, believe is going to happen, A, and B, get into what's happening with the dollar?
[00:35:08.441 --> 00:35:16.385]  Okay, first of all, the creation of the American Union was scheduled for January 1st, 2005, and Dick Cheney said that
[00:35:20.163 --> 00:35:34.353]  In a video that I have, where David Rockefeller congratulated him for his talk, but he said we're on track to create the American Union, or they call it the Council of Americas, by January 1st, 2005.
[00:35:34.993 --> 00:35:36.735]  He really meant the American Union.
[00:35:38.217 --> 00:35:45.241]  And by the way, on that same clip, he's so arrogant, he goes, I didn't tell my constituents I was doing this, and they all laugh at us.
[00:35:45.521 --> 00:35:51.945]  It's real funny that he can do this on C-SPAN, knowing his constituents in Wyoming aren't watching C-SPAN.
[00:35:52.245 --> 00:35:52.665]  That's right.
[00:35:53.145 --> 00:35:55.787]  I mean, every meeting I watch of these guys now, they laugh at us.
[00:35:55.867 --> 00:35:56.347]  It's funny.
[00:35:57.543 --> 00:36:02.146]  But they have been planning this.
[00:36:02.286 --> 00:36:16.496]  In fact, I've got the minutes of the first Bilderberg meeting in which David Rockefeller talked about world economy at that first Bilderberg meeting in 1954 and the planning of the creation of the European Union.
[00:36:17.316 --> 00:36:20.478]  And so they have very long-range plans.
[00:36:20.898 --> 00:36:24.201]  They don't know what's going to happen this quarter or this month.
[00:36:25.204 --> 00:36:29.245]  If it slips a little bit, we'll do it next year or next five years.
[00:36:30.446 --> 00:36:31.966]  Long-term strategic planning.
[00:36:31.986 --> 00:36:32.447]  That's right.
[00:36:32.827 --> 00:36:34.927]  And it's like the frog in the pan.
[00:36:35.007 --> 00:36:39.329]  As you gradually turn the heat up, the frog is cooked before he knows about it.
[00:36:39.869 --> 00:36:41.450]  And they're doing that to the public.
[00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:51.073]  And I know that if they are too aggressive that people will fall out in the streets by the millions and maybe bring out some guillotines.
[00:36:52.148 --> 00:36:58.992]  But they're now rolling out the sound cannons and the microwave guns in the Fed rallies.
[00:36:59.633 --> 00:36:59.833]  Yeah.
[00:37:00.674 --> 00:37:21.447]  Well, the Patriot Act and several other things, they continually try to take our freedoms away from us and try to make us all seem as though we're evil people, we're terrorists.
[00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:30.432]  And I think you probably have talked about FEMA saying that they've got a list of people that are terrorists.
[00:37:30.672 --> 00:37:30.972]  Yes.
[00:37:31.672 --> 00:37:32.572]  Or sympathizers.
[00:37:32.592 --> 00:37:34.052]  And we've all got to be put in camps, yeah.
[00:37:34.072 --> 00:37:37.033]  And so you and I are probably deep on that list.
[00:37:38.073 --> 00:37:43.674]  And so... Oh yeah, they won't give me my four-year for my FBI file.
[00:37:43.814 --> 00:37:46.135]  It says national security.
[00:37:46.315 --> 00:37:47.115]  National security.
[00:37:47.195 --> 00:37:49.796]  I can't see what lies they've got in there about me.
[00:37:51.883 --> 00:37:55.004]  Legally, you should be able to go to the FBI and see your records.
[00:37:55.144 --> 00:37:56.544]  No, no, exactly.
[00:37:56.584 --> 00:37:57.425]  I've talked to a lawyer.
[00:37:57.505 --> 00:37:58.445]  I'm going to have to sue them.
[00:38:00.266 --> 00:38:06.768]  But there's all sorts of garbage in there, and you and I have very thick files in the CIA and the FBI.
[00:38:07.488 --> 00:38:07.988]  Oh, of course.
[00:38:08.048 --> 00:38:09.048]  They study what we're doing.
[00:38:09.388 --> 00:38:17.251]  I've noticed Glenn Beck and others are now copying all the terms I use, like we've got to stop the fall of the republic, the new world order, but then he
[00:38:18.388 --> 00:38:23.030]  They're doing that so he can be in control of the opposition and lead them and control them.
[00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:24.011]  Right.
[00:38:24.111 --> 00:38:29.673]  And they have these stooges out there to try to drive us in one direction or another.
[00:38:30.153 --> 00:38:33.395]  And they try to appear to be one thing, but they're really the other.
[00:38:34.675 --> 00:38:36.976]  Robert, again, back to the dollar.
[00:38:36.996 --> 00:38:38.257]  We were talking during a break.
[00:38:40.758 --> 00:38:42.679]  Do you think this is the rush of the exits?
[00:38:43.139 --> 00:38:45.380]  Do you think this is the beginning of the death of the dollar?
[00:38:46.463 --> 00:38:47.483]  There's no question about it.
[00:38:47.503 --> 00:38:52.865]  They'll end up with the International Monetary System.
[00:38:53.725 --> 00:38:54.785]  I don't know what they'll call it.
[00:38:55.606 --> 00:38:59.387]  In the European Union, they call it the Euro.
[00:39:00.347 --> 00:39:04.708]  In, I believe, Africa, they call it the Afro or something like that.
[00:39:04.728 --> 00:39:04.808]  Yes.
[00:39:05.208 --> 00:39:07.909]  But they will create one money system.
[00:39:08.449 --> 00:39:09.209]  And so
[00:39:12.728 --> 00:39:14.848]  Well that's what Rockefeller told Aaron Russo.
[00:39:15.069 --> 00:39:15.489]  And he said,
[00:39:35.942 --> 00:39:37.783]  Our license plates, our chips, everything.
[00:39:37.823 --> 00:39:38.883]  We're going to be above the law.
[00:39:38.963 --> 00:39:40.283]  All of you are going to be slaves.
[00:39:40.684 --> 00:39:42.564]  And that's actually what they're implementing now.
[00:39:42.904 --> 00:39:45.765]  Where they're reading our license plates in real time everywhere.
[00:39:45.905 --> 00:39:46.245]  That's right.
[00:39:46.265 --> 00:39:47.606]  Tracking everything we do.
[00:39:48.646 --> 00:39:49.667]  This is outrageous.
[00:39:50.367 --> 00:39:56.069]  And on the streets in London, there are thousands of cameras all over London.
[00:39:56.869 --> 00:39:58.309]  And they're doing it here.
[00:39:58.449 --> 00:40:02.891]  And they say that they're putting them on the freeways so they can control traffic.
[00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:06.011]  It's also so they can tell where you're going.
[00:40:06.211 --> 00:40:17.594]  Well, they admit that now, but I actually have an article here in my stack from today where, oh look, how China's yuan can become the new global currency.
[00:40:18.194 --> 00:40:18.915]  There's one article.
[00:40:19.235 --> 00:40:19.655]  But look at this.
[00:40:19.695 --> 00:40:22.056]  Cameras keep track of all cars entering Medina.
[00:40:22.556 --> 00:40:24.676]  City signs have a unique way of greeting people.
[00:40:25.837 --> 00:40:29.198]  For instance, motorists are told they're entering a special place where people care.
[00:40:30.182 --> 00:40:39.826]  And it goes on to say the cameras have recently been installed in intersections to monitor every vehicle coming into the city under the Automatic License Plate Recognition Project.
[00:40:40.367 --> 00:40:43.468]  Once a car enters the town, a camera captures its license plate number.
[00:40:43.828 --> 00:40:46.109]  Within seconds, the number is run through the database.
[00:40:46.569 --> 00:40:50.171]  And I noticed 10 years ago they announced this in Florida and a few other towns in Texas.
[00:40:50.631 --> 00:40:51.872]  I've seen the federal orders.
[00:40:52.834 --> 00:40:56.977]  Every state in the union for at least seven years, everything you do is tracked.
[00:40:57.157 --> 00:40:57.358]  Right.
[00:40:57.558 --> 00:40:59.439]  Everywhere you go is tracked.
[00:40:59.599 --> 00:41:04.443]  And they can read hundreds of plates a second, and it has nothing to do with stopping crime.
[00:41:04.463 --> 00:41:05.964]  You notice they never use it for crime.
[00:41:06.384 --> 00:41:08.446]  This is a homeland security grid.
[00:41:08.686 --> 00:41:22.016]  Right, and if you don't think they can do it, go to some of these intersections where they have a camera, and anyone that runs a red light, within a week or so, they'll get a ticket.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:29.106]  And because they have the ability to read the license plate and go into their database and know exactly who you are.
[00:41:29.126 --> 00:41:29.486]  That's right.
[00:41:29.586 --> 00:41:32.789]  Like out in California, I see the old big flash bulbs that go off.
[00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:34.571]  They don't need that anymore.
[00:41:34.591 --> 00:41:38.314]  They don't need the flashing systems at night to take a photo of your car.
[00:41:38.374 --> 00:41:39.555]  Now it's license plate reading.
[00:41:39.856 --> 00:41:40.716]  And then here's another one.
[00:41:40.776 --> 00:41:41.337]  News 10.
[00:41:41.677 --> 00:41:45.200]  Sheriff's Department responds to sonic device outrage.
[00:41:45.661 --> 00:41:47.602]  The San Diego County Sheriff's Department
[00:41:48.263 --> 00:42:03.913]  Tuesday responded to News 10's report that a new sonic weapon known as Long Range Acoustic Device, LRAD, that the technology has been used to control crowds in Iraq and control insurgents and it's now in the Sheriff's Department's possession being used at the Tea Party rallies.
[00:42:04.493 --> 00:42:12.438]  So again, they've militarized the police, they're training them to go after the people and all of this was set up before
[00:42:13.584 --> 00:42:16.587]  The big banks try to bring us into this economic implosion.
[00:42:16.727 --> 00:42:17.248]  That's right.
[00:42:17.588 --> 00:42:31.804]  I've seen that sound system on the military channel where one of the reporters got within range of that and all of a sudden they turned it on and he just ran away because he said it was so painful.
[00:42:32.845 --> 00:42:35.388]  Well these are also soft kill weapon trainers.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:45.166]  The studies show if they shoot you with a sound beam, a microwave, rubber bullets, that they're more apt next time to fire real bullets when they're ordered to.
[00:42:45.966 --> 00:42:50.349]  So it's just like you train an attack dog on dummies first before you give him real blood.
[00:42:50.649 --> 00:42:52.891]  We'll be back in one minute to talk about solutions.
[00:42:53.191 --> 00:42:54.752]  Three minutes to talk about solutions.
[00:42:54.892 --> 00:43:02.357]  Airandaqua.com is your one-stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.
[00:43:02.617 --> 00:43:06.702]  AaronAqua.com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and our water.
[00:43:06.922 --> 00:43:10.886]  And they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these harmful toxins.
[00:43:11.227 --> 00:43:15.752]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[00:43:15.772 --> 00:43:19.656]  AaronAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[00:43:19.676 --> 00:43:24.041]  AaronAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[00:43:24.281 --> 00:43:24.761]  I think so.
[00:43:57.921 --> 00:44:03.326]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:44:03.707 --> 00:44:11.354]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:44:12.048 --> 00:44:19.109]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:44:19.489 --> 00:44:30.891]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:44:31.231 --> 00:44:34.732]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:44:35.192 --> 00:44:37.152]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:44:37.452 --> 00:44:41.293]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:44:54.835 --> 00:44:56.136]  Are you constantly tired?
[00:44:56.416 --> 00:44:57.977]  Have a hard time concentrating?
[00:44:58.257 --> 00:45:01.298]  Experience muscle weakness or have problems with digestion?
[00:45:01.558 --> 00:45:04.300]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.

[00:45:15.865 --> 00:45:24.109]  Studies show that Liquid Zeolite captures triggering antigens, which cause allergies, migraines, and asthma, decreasing the rate and severity of these symptoms.

[00:46:05.486 --> 00:46:17.593]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to start taking your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231 on this live Wednesday, September 16, 2009 edition.
[00:46:17.613 --> 00:46:24.196]  And after Mr. Ross leaves us in about 30 minutes, I'm going to do a big news blitz and more of your phone calls.
[00:46:24.216 --> 00:46:28.419]  So I said I'd start the show with this flu news, and I haven't gotten to it yet, but I'm going to.
[00:46:29.443 --> 00:46:37.228]  Robert, you and your new book that isn't out yet but will be out soon, you get into your ideas for solutions, monetizing the debt versus a gold standard.
[00:46:37.248 --> 00:46:42.110]  A lot of people are against the gold standard because the banks have hoarded all the gold so they'd be back in control again.
[00:46:42.131 --> 00:46:45.593]  But I mean, don't we just start with auditing the Fed?
[00:46:45.613 --> 00:46:47.334]  Don't we have to get rid of the Fed first?
[00:46:47.854 --> 00:46:50.896]  And I guess we also need to then, or nationalize the Fed.
[00:46:51.596 --> 00:46:56.977]  Well, first of all, none of this will happen, Alex, until we straighten it out in a timeline.
[00:46:57.497 --> 00:47:01.138]  The first thing we have to do is correct our voting system.
[00:47:02.018 --> 00:47:06.699]  It's so corrupt now that they can make anybody win an election.
[00:47:07.659 --> 00:47:19.461]  And so, first of all, we have to go to paper ballots everywhere, counted by local citizens, and posted in local newspapers before it's sent to Washington.
[00:47:20.612 --> 00:47:26.974]  Now once we have the voting system corrected, then we need to eliminate the two-party system.
[00:47:27.114 --> 00:47:34.477]  The two-party system, if the Democrats are in control, the Republicans fight everything they try to do.
[00:47:34.617 --> 00:47:39.199]  If the Republicans are in control, the Democrats fight everything they try to do.
[00:47:39.219 --> 00:47:46.901]  So they should not be allowed to do anything to enhance or degrade a party for any reason.
[00:47:47.001 --> 00:47:48.122]  They ought to be there to
[00:47:49.496 --> 00:47:56.381]  Do things for their constituents to improve the quality of life of their constituents, but they haven't done that probably ever.
[00:47:57.621 --> 00:48:09.849]  So first of all, then if we have in every election, there should be as many independent people running for office as we can drive out of the bushes.
[00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:14.952]  And a great way to have would be to have 25% of Congress
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:23.825]  One independent party, 25%, another independent party, 25% Democrats and 25% Republicans.
[00:48:24.585 --> 00:48:25.906]  That way they lose control.
[00:48:28.448 --> 00:48:40.597]  Even better than that is to have every elected representative an independent person so that they are not controlled by a party, that they're there to represent their constituents.
[00:48:41.658 --> 00:48:46.241]  We need to change the total election system.
[00:48:47.765 --> 00:49:12.823]  For example, we should limit the time of campaigning for presidential office to six months, and to a member of Congress or the House of Representatives to three months, and then demand that all TV stations must provide an avenue for campaigning of everybody running for office.
[00:49:17.475 --> 00:49:21.197]  And if we don't do that, then nothing will change.
[00:49:21.558 --> 00:49:30.463]  Because we've got, and when the election comes up, we need to vote against every incumbent except about six, and I name those six in my book.
[00:49:31.804 --> 00:49:35.226]  And the reason that is, we need to get their attention.
[00:49:36.425 --> 00:49:37.846]  Well, that's what politics is.
[00:49:38.426 --> 00:49:43.809]  I mean, you listen to a Sean Hannity or somebody, they sound great when their party's out of power.
[00:49:44.269 --> 00:49:47.811]  But as soon as the Republicans back in, they're going to support the whole New World Order agenda.
[00:49:48.151 --> 00:49:50.592]  Just like Democrats sound great when Bush is in power.
[00:49:50.852 --> 00:49:51.033]  Right.
[00:49:51.073 --> 00:49:54.895]  But as soon as they get in power, they just continue because they're all bought and paid for.
[00:49:55.435 --> 00:50:04.560]  Can't we just bypass all that and arrest the Federal Reserve Board and arrest Rockefeller and Rothschilds and indict them for their crimes and just get our system back that way?
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:13.382]  You can't do that until you get control of Congress and presidency.
[00:50:13.702 --> 00:50:14.522]  But how do we do that?
[00:50:14.542 --> 00:50:15.762]  Do we start at the local level?
[00:50:15.822 --> 00:50:19.143]  Because I see the local level as the area where we actually have power.
[00:50:19.383 --> 00:50:28.985]  Correct the voting system first, then have independent people run so that we get the control of the Democrats and Republicans out of Congress.
[00:50:29.185 --> 00:50:29.645]  We'll stay there.
[00:50:29.665 --> 00:50:30.785]  We've got a break for one minute.
[00:50:30.805 --> 00:50:34.006]  We're going to come back with the final hour, your phone calls, and a lot more.
[00:50:36.471 --> 00:50:38.297]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:50:39.983 --> 00:50:42.250]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:49.838]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:51:14.915 --> 00:51:15.435]  We're good.
[00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:49.595]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:50.076 --> 00:51:52.841]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:03.669 --> 00:52:08.952]  We're taking your phone calls from Robert Galen Ross coming up in the next segment at 800-259-9231.
[00:52:08.972 --> 00:52:12.934]  But you're running through your new book that isn't even out yet.
[00:52:12.954 --> 00:52:14.394]  It'll be out, what, the next month or so?
[00:52:14.695 --> 00:52:15.395]  Within two weeks.
[00:52:16.015 --> 00:52:19.757]  Within two weeks, so folks can get it then at your website that we've got up on screen.
[00:52:20.117 --> 00:52:22.578]  But continue with your idea of solutions.
[00:52:23.079 --> 00:52:31.583]  Okay, after we correct the voting process and we eliminate the two-party system, then we have independent people within Congress
[00:52:32.335 --> 00:52:37.599]  That will do things for the constituents rather than for special interests.
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:41.502]  So then we need to attack the Federal Reserve System.
[00:52:45.946 --> 00:52:58.335]  There's an attorney out in California named Ellen Hodgkin Brown that did a research on this on the Federal Reserve and she says
[00:52:59.246 --> 00:53:02.668]  That if we nationalize the Federal Reserve,
[00:53:03.846 --> 00:53:09.569]  We can completely eliminate the income tax for everybody within the United States.
[00:53:10.189 --> 00:53:15.892]  And she goes through every step along the way to prove that she can do that.
[00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:26.257]  Well, that certainly could have been done with the comprehensive financial report information that Walter Berrien and others put out.
[00:53:26.397 --> 00:53:30.979]  The problem is they've now created this 1.5 quadrillion in fiat made-up debt.
[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:33.200]  And so
[00:53:34.983 --> 00:53:38.047]  But clearly, for those that don't know, I love the point Ron Paul always makes.
[00:53:38.648 --> 00:53:40.290]  They will show the Capitol behind him.
[00:53:41.462 --> 00:53:48.367]  When he's on Fox News or CNN and they'll say, well you want to get rid of the income tax and Federal Reserve, how will we fund the government?
[00:53:48.787 --> 00:53:51.209]  And he says, well we built this capital on the whole country without it.
[00:53:51.229 --> 00:53:52.530]  We didn't have it until 1913.
[00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:55.972]  The income tax wasn't more than a percentage point until the 1950s.
[00:53:56.973 --> 00:53:59.935]  Not one red cent of the Federal Reserve money goes around this country.
[00:54:00.175 --> 00:54:00.935]  That's right.
[00:54:01.816 --> 00:54:07.220]  But if you take the total interest earned by the Federal Reserve
[00:54:08.787 --> 00:54:20.979]  Uh, in a year, and she goes back and uses the year 2005 for example, and she takes the total income tax paid and then the total interest earned by the Federal Reserve.
[00:54:21.739 --> 00:54:30.167]  And then if we eliminate the IRS, that's another $10 billion of cost that we eliminate.
[00:54:30.187 --> 00:54:32.950]  And then if we, uh,
[00:54:35.962 --> 00:54:38.283]  Yeah, none of these countries are starting wars.
[00:54:38.303 --> 00:54:41.185]  Regional groups can deal with themselves.
[00:54:41.205 --> 00:54:41.965]  That's why the globalists
[00:55:03.777 --> 00:55:17.903]  ...are always going in and stirring up and funding terror groups, funding armies, funding other countries to attack other nations, because you've got this multi-trillion-dollar-a-year business, weapons sales worldwide and armies, they've got to have a business, so they go out and start wars!
[00:55:18.623 --> 00:55:20.244]  But they start wars for the banks.
[00:55:20.664 --> 00:55:31.108]  The banks finance both sides of every war, and they finance the reconstruction of the countries destroyed in the wars, and so if we eliminate wars,
[00:55:33.123 --> 00:55:36.645]  Think of the... That's right, they sell weapon systems to both sides.
[00:55:37.125 --> 00:55:38.486]  They finance both sides.
[00:55:38.686 --> 00:55:40.788]  They own the military industrial complex.
[00:55:41.468 --> 00:55:42.729]  So they make money off of it.
[00:55:43.089 --> 00:55:49.933]  And so we've got to stop the money source of the elite.
[00:55:51.494 --> 00:55:59.579]  If you bring all the troops back, then we also need to create jobs in the United States.
[00:55:59.899 --> 00:56:02.461]  So the next step we need to do is
[00:56:03.371 --> 00:56:16.895]  Is to have the President get out of the World Trade Organization, get out of the United Nations, get out of NAFTA, get out of CAFTA, and get out of all free trade agreements that have been signed in the past.
[00:56:16.915 --> 00:56:19.636]  They're all one-sided for the globalists to consolidate power.
[00:56:19.836 --> 00:56:25.057]  But then you tell all nations, we will trade with you on an equal basis.
[00:56:25.537 --> 00:56:31.819]  For every million dollars that we import, we're going to export a million dollars to you.
[00:56:33.507 --> 00:56:34.608]  They wouldn't have any choice.
[00:56:35.869 --> 00:56:36.569]  Yeah, they don't.
[00:56:36.849 --> 00:56:40.571]  But the globalists like to do sweetheart deals where it's not a level playing field.
[00:56:40.851 --> 00:56:44.713]  I want to ask you about Obama being the first president to be the head of the U.N.
[00:56:44.733 --> 00:56:48.916]  Security Council, which a lot of people point out in the Constitution is illegal.
[00:56:49.396 --> 00:56:54.319]  But it was also illegal for Colin Powell to become a knight or George Bush Sr., but they did it.
[00:56:54.519 --> 00:56:54.999]  Stay with us.
[00:56:55.239 --> 00:56:57.860]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:03.222]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:57:03.583 --> 00:57:05.323]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:57:05.643 --> 00:57:10.445]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:57:10.626 --> 00:57:11.546]  How much do you want?
[00:57:11.806 --> 00:57:12.567]  When do you want it?
[00:57:12.927 --> 00:57:14.528]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:57:14.829 --> 00:57:15.649]  When will you need it?
[00:57:15.889 --> 00:57:17.971]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:57:18.091 --> 00:57:19.212]  Will there be any food?
[00:57:19.432 --> 00:57:20.773]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:57:20.974 --> 00:57:26.038]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:57:26.238 --> 00:57:29.421]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:57:29.821 --> 00:57:33.284]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:57:33.624 --> 00:57:34.624]  How much will you need?
[00:57:34.845 --> 00:57:35.465]  We don't know.
[00:57:35.765 --> 00:57:36.665]  How much do you want?
[00:57:36.865 --> 00:57:37.606]  All you can get.
[00:57:37.786 --> 00:57:38.626]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:57:38.886 --> 00:57:41.647]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:57:43.708 --> 00:57:44.628]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:57:54.249 --> 00:57:59.416]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:57:59.556 --> 00:58:01.459]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:58:01.639 --> 00:58:03.922]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:58:04.082 --> 00:58:05.945]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:58:06.365 --> 00:58:07.727]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:58:07.987 --> 00:58:09.029]  There is a solution.
[00:58:09.249 --> 00:58:17.275]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:58:31.184 --> 00:58:36.748]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[00:58:54.983 --> 00:58:56.244]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:56.284 --> 00:59:01.650]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:06.515]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:59:06.895 --> 00:59:07.296]  It's true.
[00:59:07.396 --> 00:59:11.980]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:59:12.481 --> 00:59:17.186]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:59:17.697 --> 00:59:24.620]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.700]  And here's the best part.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:32.303]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:59:32.623 --> 00:59:35.464]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:35.804 --> 00:59:38.946]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:59:38.966 --> 00:59:39.146]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:39.166 --> 00:59:39.406]  Remember,
[00:59:47.725 --> 00:59:52.227]  Dan in the Philippines, Manfred in Montana, David in Texas, Terry in Indiana, Jock in California.
[00:59:52.247 --> 00:59:56.229]  We're going to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:59:56.249 --> 00:59:57.349]  We're about 15 minutes away from
[01:00:16.357 --> 01:00:17.518]  Huge news blitzes.
[01:00:18.118 --> 01:00:21.739]  Tons of key news I'm going to cover until the end of the show.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:25.141]  Coming up on a host of issues starting in the next segment.
[01:00:25.661 --> 01:00:27.322]  Final segment with Robert Galen Ross.
[01:00:27.362 --> 01:00:29.723]  Time has really gone by fast with him.
[01:00:29.743 --> 01:00:32.384]  I want to go to your calls here in just a moment.
[01:00:33.224 --> 01:00:36.246]  But we were getting into Obama becoming the first president.
[01:00:37.119 --> 01:00:39.541]  To be the head of the UN Security Council.
[01:00:40.201 --> 01:00:50.489]  No president's ever done that because the Constitution states they can't be part of other government bodies or boards and make decisions for the US without Congress's approval.
[01:00:51.685 --> 01:00:54.426]  And it wasn't just us saying this is unprecedented.
[01:00:54.526 --> 01:01:04.730]  AP and Reuters in the last week had all these weird statements about sealing our new closeness with the UN and global governance and the new bank of the world.
[01:01:04.790 --> 01:01:05.971]  I mean, this is really happening.
[01:01:06.351 --> 01:01:07.471]  Yeah, no question about it.
[01:01:07.811 --> 01:01:10.292]  And that's part of their overall plan.
[01:01:10.613 --> 01:01:12.633]  It's all very carefully orchestrated and
[01:01:14.855 --> 01:01:22.682]  They think there's nothing we can do about it, but all you got to do is think about how many people showed up in Washington this last weekend.
[01:01:23.543 --> 01:01:32.650]  But they're being led by loyal opposition, and that's the plan, is to have a guy that supported the Banker Bailout, a guy that supported the Patriot Act, Glenn Beck, lead them.
[01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:33.411]  That's the problem.
[01:01:33.951 --> 01:01:41.638]  Yeah, we need to have someone leading the crowd that has no agenda except to... But it does show, you're right, people are waking up.
[01:01:44.027 --> 01:01:49.636]  I mean, Greenspan's in the news today, Bloomberg whining, saying he thinks Congress is going to take the Fed over.
[01:01:49.917 --> 01:01:52.001]  So they're definitely not arrogant anymore, though.
[01:01:52.221 --> 01:01:55.066]  We're finally identifying who the real power structure are.
[01:01:55.246 --> 01:01:55.687]  That's right.
[01:01:57.436 --> 01:01:58.937]  Ron Paul is exactly right.
[01:01:59.717 --> 01:02:04.299]  He's talking about auditing the Fed, but we really need to nationalize the Fed.
[01:02:04.599 --> 01:02:08.300]  Well, he says that if we can get the audit, then we can get the nationalization.
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:14.202]  He says they're so criminal, and he's called for criminal investigations here, that it's step one.
[01:02:14.542 --> 01:02:20.785]  It'll be hard to just abolish them up front, but the Fed has said, if you audit us, you might as well abolish us.
[01:02:21.465 --> 01:02:27.688]  Well, we really need something like the Fed in order to manage our money system within the United States.
[01:02:27.928 --> 01:02:29.449]  To certainly get out of it, yeah.
[01:02:29.529 --> 01:02:31.730]  But we need to own the Fed.
[01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:33.651]  And have it be transparent.
[01:02:33.771 --> 01:02:34.151]  That's right.
[01:02:35.147 --> 01:02:39.790]  And if we own it, then all the transparency and that sort of thing?
[01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:45.333]  Well, Paul's got a von Mies degree, and he's a doctorate in economics and a medical doctor, and I respect him.
[01:02:45.873 --> 01:02:47.034]  And he likes sound money.
[01:02:47.334 --> 01:02:50.235]  And if we'd have stayed on silver and gold, they couldn't have done what they've done.
[01:02:50.275 --> 01:02:52.877]  But now we're in this global fiat system.
[01:02:53.517 --> 01:02:57.099]  I look at the other models of using fiat to empower us.
[01:02:57.639 --> 01:03:00.781]  If it was done properly and openly, it could be a great system.
[01:03:01.201 --> 01:03:12.264]  Yeah, but you'd have to really have a high value of gold if we, say, went to the gold standard, because the federal debt is something between $75 and $100 trillion.
[01:03:12.284 --> 01:03:14.085]  So it'd have to be a million dollars an ounce.
[01:03:14.245 --> 01:03:14.745]  That's right.
[01:03:15.045 --> 01:03:23.568]  So there's not enough, if you use it at today's price, there's not enough gold out there to cover all the cash requirements.
[01:03:23.948 --> 01:03:26.689]  I don't think people realize the type of inflation we're talking about.
[01:03:26.709 --> 01:03:28.529]  Hyperinflation.
[01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:29.990]  Hyperinflation.
[01:03:31.038 --> 01:03:34.299]  Finish up real fast, running through a few more of your points, and let's take some calls.
[01:03:34.379 --> 01:03:38.319]  Okay, another thing that we need to do is we need to eliminate short-selling.
[01:03:39.139 --> 01:03:41.740]  And short-selling is... And naked short-selling.
[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:51.381]  Yeah, short-selling is, let's say that I borrow your car and sell it, and then later on I buy it back at a lower price.
[01:03:51.822 --> 01:04:00.483]  Well, naked short-selling is, I can take your car and sell it without you knowing about it, without borrowing it.
[01:04:01.289 --> 01:04:05.391]  And then if anyone defaults, I said, that's too bad.
[01:04:05.451 --> 01:04:06.932]  In fact, you never even had the car.
[01:04:07.332 --> 01:04:07.872]  That's right.
[01:04:07.892 --> 01:04:11.074]  You just sold thin air to somebody.
[01:04:11.094 --> 01:04:11.514]  That's right.
[01:04:13.633 --> 01:04:20.296]  Also, currency speculation has caused the economies of many nations to be crashed.
[01:04:20.796 --> 01:04:22.857]  George Soros is a major actor in this.
[01:04:23.877 --> 01:04:28.139]  And then he goes on TV and talks about how he's the savior trying to fix this.
[01:04:28.179 --> 01:04:28.419]  Right.
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:31.821]  But this is based on selling something you don't have.
[01:04:32.881 --> 01:04:33.922]  That's what a shorting is.
[01:04:35.001 --> 01:04:43.469]  And so we need to outlaw shorting completely by saying that you cannot sell anything that you don't have legal documented right to.
[01:04:44.665 --> 01:04:50.487]  And of course Wall Street would not want that because that's where they make all their money.
[01:04:50.527 --> 01:05:03.811]  And let's be clear that they then just made made-up derivatives, paper, credit default swaps and insurance certifications, used the money off that, leveraged it ten times, then went out and engaged in all these different
[01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:06.572]  Manipulations of the stock market.
[01:05:06.912 --> 01:05:09.594]  This is just a complete group of con artist frauds.
[01:05:09.654 --> 01:05:10.234]  That's right.
[01:05:10.715 --> 01:05:17.599]  And the only way you can overcome that is completely nationalize the Federal Reserve and nationalize all federal banks.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.680]  But here's the problem.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.403]  The globalists are going to stage wars, stage nuke attacks, release bioweapons.
[01:05:23.804 --> 01:05:28.887]  They're going to try to use Northcom to block Galen Ross and Ron Paul and others from doing this.
[01:05:29.227 --> 01:05:32.289]  So do you educate the public about false flag terror?
[01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:33.430]  That's right.
[01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.890]  You have to.
[01:05:35.351 --> 01:05:37.034]  First of all, you've got to do it with education.
[01:05:37.054 --> 01:05:39.076]  Yeah, because they're not going to just let us go do this.
[01:05:39.136 --> 01:05:41.759]  I mean, clearly we're marching, people are waking up.
[01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.523]  We have a chance to do this, to dream is destiny.
[01:05:44.783 --> 01:05:49.249]  But I'm saying, they're not going to just sit back and let us do this.
[01:05:49.289 --> 01:05:50.370]  So what's your idea there?
[01:05:51.111 --> 01:05:51.271]  Well...
[01:05:52.445 --> 01:05:58.466]  That's one reason for this book is try to educate the people of what's really going on behind the scenes.
[01:05:59.147 --> 01:06:05.608]  And once everybody understands what's going on, then instead of a million people marching on Washington, there might be five million.
[01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:06.348]  I agree with you.
[01:06:06.428 --> 01:06:13.930]  If the average cop who's being given a microwave gun to attack peaceful protesters realizes his future is being destroyed too,
[01:06:15.290 --> 01:06:18.091]  Then there's a good chance that he's not going to go along with it.
[01:06:18.151 --> 01:06:18.591]  That's right.
[01:06:18.692 --> 01:06:25.454]  And if the law enforcement people have a copy of this book or similar information, then you're right.
[01:06:25.854 --> 01:06:32.017]  When they say, all right, let's go march on those people, well then they say, no, I don't think that's right.
[01:06:32.037 --> 01:06:32.777]  We're not going to do that.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:36.341]  And then the officers might rebel.
[01:06:37.942 --> 01:06:39.962]  But it has to all be based on education.
[01:06:39.982 --> 01:06:42.684]  Well, I mean, you're an engineer who worked with oil and things.
[01:06:42.744 --> 01:06:46.325]  I mean, they admit that sodium fluoride in the water brain damages people.
[01:06:46.705 --> 01:06:48.626]  They admit the Germans put it in people's water.
[01:06:48.666 --> 01:06:50.267]  The Soviets did.
[01:06:50.847 --> 01:06:55.649]  I mean, when we tell cops don't drink the water, I mean, this is an evil elite.
[01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:56.389]  That's right.
[01:06:58.370 --> 01:07:00.351]  Tell folks what sodium fluoride does to your brain.
[01:07:01.071 --> 01:07:02.331]  Sodium fluoride is a
[01:07:04.159 --> 01:07:14.293]  It's a chemical that the Russians and the South Africans and Israelis used to make their people docile.
[01:07:17.685 --> 01:07:19.646]  It's in toothpaste, it's in water.
[01:07:20.586 --> 01:07:22.627]  And by the way, on record, they admit they do this.
[01:07:22.707 --> 01:07:24.027]  I mean, this is not our opinion.
[01:07:24.187 --> 01:07:24.607]  That's right.
[01:07:24.647 --> 01:07:34.330]  And if you read the label on a toothpaste box, it says if you swallow more than a little bit of this, immediately go to the Poison Control Center.
[01:07:34.610 --> 01:07:36.611]  Because it's a known poison.
[01:07:36.631 --> 01:07:38.571]  But I mean, I just bring that up.
[01:07:39.112 --> 01:07:40.292]  They're poisoning our water.
[01:07:40.512 --> 01:07:42.453]  Why are we even here debating this with each other?
[01:07:42.753 --> 01:07:43.093]  That's right.
[01:07:44.557 --> 01:07:50.041]  I mean, I'm asking FBI agents and others, did you get a memo telling you not to drink the water?
[01:07:50.062 --> 01:07:50.402]  No.
[01:07:50.802 --> 01:07:52.143]  You're in the same boat with us.
[01:07:52.844 --> 01:07:55.386]  And that's why I realized not to just get mad and attack them.
[01:07:56.247 --> 01:07:58.408]  Whether you know it or not, we're in the same boat together.
[01:07:58.648 --> 01:07:59.009]  That's right.
[01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.869]  This is ridiculous.
[01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:04.853]  And just because they taught you to laugh at it and say it's a conspiracy theory, you can't do that.
[01:08:04.894 --> 01:08:05.714]  Let's take some calls.
[01:08:06.054 --> 01:08:07.336]  Dan in the Philippines.
[01:08:07.616 --> 01:08:09.117]  You're on the air with Robert Galen Ross.
[01:08:09.437 --> 01:08:09.717]  Hello.
[01:08:09.757 --> 01:08:10.218]  Hello, Dan.
[01:08:11.979 --> 01:08:12.259]  Hello.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:13.000]  Hello.
[01:08:14.659 --> 01:08:16.060]  Hey, uh, wow.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.560]  It's crazy to be on here.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:24.203]  I've been, uh, only recently listening to the show, but... Well, welcome, Dan.
[01:08:24.323 --> 01:08:25.504]  It's good to have you here with us.
[01:08:25.524 --> 01:08:25.924]  Go ahead.
[01:08:25.944 --> 01:08:28.865]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:08:28.885 --> 01:08:36.409]  You know, ten plus years ago, I listened to you on the show, and I thought it was crazy, you know, seeing my brother watching on public access station.
[01:08:36.449 --> 01:08:43.932]  I'm from Austin, but I've been living in Manila for almost four years now, and I thought it was crazy, and so the last year plus,
[01:08:44.654 --> 01:08:45.555]  Anyways, going on.
[01:08:45.615 --> 01:08:46.495]  What woke you up?
[01:08:49.377 --> 01:08:51.979]  Actually, it was partly my mom.
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:58.244]  You know, I was watching Ron Paul back in the primary days.
[01:08:58.724 --> 01:08:59.565]  I had a vacation.
[01:08:59.605 --> 01:09:08.711]  I went back to the States and saw a video about Ron Paul, then I saw Freedom the Fascism of Aaron Russo woke me up really well.
[01:09:10.252 --> 01:09:12.554]  And since then, I've just been kind of dabbling, and now I'm
[01:09:13.573 --> 01:09:15.074]  I'm really going full on it right now.
[01:09:15.114 --> 01:09:21.898]  I left my company recently and so... Let's see, right there is an example.
[01:09:22.279 --> 01:09:24.760]  People wouldn't listen to us 10 years ago or 20 years ago.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:28.102]  Now they listen because everything we talked about is now coming true.
[01:09:28.523 --> 01:09:30.644]  Sir, what's your question for Robert Galen Ross?
[01:09:34.807 --> 01:09:36.888]  Sadly, I don't have a question for him directly.
[01:09:37.228 --> 01:09:37.649]  That's fine.
[01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:38.089]  You're on air.
[01:09:38.109 --> 01:09:39.030]  Go ahead and make your point.
[01:09:41.123 --> 01:09:41.745]  I don't have a point.
[01:09:41.765 --> 01:09:42.426]  I have a question.
[01:09:42.627 --> 01:09:47.760]  I saw a recent video about bracelets with microchips on them that are supposedly attached to your wrist.
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:49.124]  And I just have a question about this because
[01:09:49.975 --> 01:09:50.816]  It seems recent.
[01:09:50.856 --> 01:09:53.177]  I haven't really been keeping up, but this is something.
[01:09:53.297 --> 01:09:56.039]  Can you describe this more to me about the bracelets on the wrist?
[01:09:56.479 --> 01:09:57.720]  In fact, we'll play that.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.742]  Guys, just YouTube the term Taser Bracelets.
[01:10:02.363 --> 01:10:12.669]  Homeland Security was proposing, and Homeland Security Board said, we think it's a good idea for every American, 5-year-old child, 80-year-old woman,
[01:10:13.803 --> 01:10:19.665]  You know, 50-year-old black guy, 20-year-old white guy, everybody, to wear a Taser bracelet.
[01:10:19.985 --> 01:10:21.065]  Just like the running man.
[01:10:21.565 --> 01:10:23.286]  Almost around our neck, but around your wrist.
[01:10:23.766 --> 01:10:25.246]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[01:10:25.527 --> 01:10:28.968]  They've got the naked body scanners going in airports.
[01:10:28.988 --> 01:10:29.768]  Houston has them.
[01:10:30.288 --> 01:10:33.029]  You march your kids through, the government records their body on tape.
[01:10:33.769 --> 01:10:36.770]  Robert Galin-Ross, your comment on the Taser bracelets.
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:48.066]  Well, it's just probably short of the next move to implant a sensor within your skin, within your wrist.
[01:10:48.126 --> 01:10:49.547]  By the way, that's in the health care bill.
[01:10:49.847 --> 01:10:50.067]  Right.
[01:10:51.088 --> 01:10:55.070]  And the point of that is they can tell where you are at any time.
[01:10:56.451 --> 01:11:05.556]  They can link it to money so that if you get out of line, they shut off your sensor so that you can't spend money.
[01:11:06.437 --> 01:11:14.864]  So that's the long-range plan is to have some mechanism to absolutely control everything you do and know where you are at all times.
[01:11:14.924 --> 01:11:16.806]  And it was two weeks before Tom broke off.
[01:11:16.846 --> 01:11:18.867]  And I appreciate your call from the Philippines, Dan.
[01:11:18.887 --> 01:11:19.628]  Good to have you on board.
[01:11:19.668 --> 01:11:20.229]  God bless you.
[01:11:22.210 --> 01:11:23.071]  It was right before Dan...
[01:11:24.488 --> 01:11:27.069]  Tom Brokaw retired, right before Tom Brokaw.
[01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:27.989]  It was Tom Brokaw.
[01:11:28.429 --> 01:11:38.232]  And I've got the tape around here somewhere, and they were talking about Fallujah, where they have these checkpoints all around it, and you're given your ID card, and if you're ever caught without the ID card, you're killed on the spot.
[01:11:38.852 --> 01:11:42.133]  And he said it straight-faced on NBC News.
[01:11:42.813 --> 01:11:47.154]  Tom Brokaw, he said, and if they're caught without their card, they are executed.
[01:11:47.974 --> 01:11:49.135]  And that's the system.
[01:11:49.155 --> 01:11:50.095]  That's right.
[01:11:50.715 --> 01:11:51.035]  Stay there.
[01:11:51.055 --> 01:11:52.336]  We'll do one more segment with our guest.
[01:11:52.356 --> 01:11:53.136]  Take a few more calls.
[01:11:53.156 --> 01:11:53.556]  Stay with us.
[01:11:57.102 --> 01:11:59.743]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[01:12:00.183 --> 01:12:02.463]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[01:12:02.803 --> 01:12:06.144]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutraversal Foods.
[01:12:06.584 --> 01:12:12.945]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[01:12:13.265 --> 01:12:16.806]  Dig into our chili with cornmeal dumplings and you'll feel like a wealthy Texan.
[01:12:17.146 --> 01:12:20.907]  Or sip a cup of warm potato cheddar soup and be soothed on a cold rainy day.
[01:12:23.148 --> 01:12:23.929]  We're good to go.
[01:12:23.949 --> 01:12:24.169]  I think?
[01:12:45.759 --> 01:12:47.020]  Call 1-800-409-5633, visit efoodsrec.com or call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:12:54.839 --> 01:12:58.002]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[01:12:58.342 --> 01:13:00.103]  Now, going green can save money.
[01:13:00.263 --> 01:13:05.607]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[01:13:05.828 --> 01:13:13.554]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[01:13:13.854 --> 01:13:24.562]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[01:13:24.582 --> 01:13:24.942]  I think so.
[01:13:55.868 --> 01:13:59.292]  Attention please, I've come with a message of information.
[01:13:59.312 --> 01:14:01.855]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:14:01.875 --> 01:14:03.096]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:14:03.116 --> 01:14:04.758]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:14:04.838 --> 01:14:07.681]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:14:07.741 --> 01:14:11.365]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:14:21.017 --> 01:14:25.810]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:14:25.890 --> 01:14:26.993]  An inside job.
[01:14:29.677 --> 01:14:30.718]  How dare you?
[01:14:32.299 --> 01:14:37.183]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:14:37.203 --> 01:14:39.985]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:14:40.085 --> 01:14:46.509]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:16:07.208 --> 01:16:09.550]  We're here live, final segment with Robert Galen Ross.
[01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:13.331]  I'm going to go through a news blitz, continue with your calls in the next segment.
[01:16:13.872 --> 01:16:18.014]  He's got a lot of new stuff at his website, 4rie.com.
[01:16:18.034 --> 01:16:21.315]  You can also get some of his books and materials at InfoWars.com.
[01:16:21.335 --> 01:16:24.237]  He's got something new, Who's Who of the Elite by Robert Galen Ross.
[01:16:25.057 --> 01:16:26.778]  They don't dare let us tell the people.
[01:16:26.878 --> 01:16:32.860]  It's a computer program and it's got the entire background on the elites.
[01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:37.903]  The Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg, Skull & Bones, Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:16:37.923 --> 01:16:41.304]  13,795 elite members in 58 nations.
[01:16:41.744 --> 01:16:44.766]  He's got stuff like the first minutes of the first Bilderberg meeting on here.
[01:16:45.166 --> 01:16:47.767]  Really powerful material available.
[01:16:48.227 --> 01:16:51.889]  And his new book coming out in two weeks, What the Elite Have Done.
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:55.440]  To America and how to fix it.
[01:16:55.901 --> 01:16:57.641]  Let's take a few final calls for him.
[01:16:58.321 --> 01:17:01.242]  Jock in California, you're on the air.
[01:17:01.302 --> 01:17:01.742]  Go ahead.
[01:17:02.743 --> 01:17:09.284]  Alex, it's a pleasure to be on with you and it was so great to hear Charlie Sheen on your show yesterday.
[01:17:10.165 --> 01:17:18.187]  And since President Obama won't talk with Charlie about his 20 points on 9-11 or even acknowledge his letter,
[01:17:19.062 --> 01:17:37.276]  And since Popular Mechanics won't debate him live on his 20 points, and Larry King won't have him on, and no other major talk show will have Charlie on, I guess it's down to Meghan McCain, who said on The View on September 10th that she wouldn't take Charlie's political advice because of his experience with prostitutes.
[01:17:38.617 --> 01:17:47.824]  Meghan is ignoring Charlie's challenge to debate him, as well as everybody else, but she has a blog called McCain Blogette.
[01:17:48.767 --> 01:17:55.279]  Um, where anyone can comment, and I just wondered if, uh, it would be interesting if a million patriots, uh, wrote comments in them.
[01:17:55.339 --> 01:17:56.521]  Yeah, no, that's a good idea.
[01:17:56.601 --> 01:18:02.010]  People should go to Obama's press conferences, they should go to his press secretary's comments.
[01:18:03.038 --> 01:18:06.720]  I mean, when Charlie goes to the restaurant, it gets on TV.
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:07.901]  Okay?
[01:18:08.141 --> 01:18:10.942]  But here he is saying, I'm ready to go on TV to debate you guys.
[01:18:10.982 --> 01:18:12.043]  It'll get huge ratings.
[01:18:12.403 --> 01:18:15.725]  They won't touch it because he has the facts.
[01:18:16.285 --> 01:18:17.326]  He has the evidence.
[01:18:17.386 --> 01:18:18.767]  He has those 20 bullet points.
[01:18:19.407 --> 01:18:23.649]  And so the answer to their censorship is to only spread the material.
[01:18:23.709 --> 01:18:24.990]  I'm going to talk about it in the next segment.
[01:18:26.448 --> 01:18:28.750]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:31.131]  I want to talk to you about the statement that Jimmy Carter made today.
[01:18:54.878 --> 01:18:59.167]  As an African American, whether you made it yesterday or today, his comment is outrageous.
[01:18:59.808 --> 01:19:06.381]  You know, to make it seem like that you would only have to be a white person or a racist in order to disagree with Obama.
[01:19:07.426 --> 01:19:08.706]  I see this all the time.
[01:19:08.746 --> 01:19:09.346]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:09.627 --> 01:19:12.327]  He's using the race car, and I'll hold you over because I want to talk about this.
[01:19:12.347 --> 01:19:13.768]  I want to be able to say about it to Robert.
[01:19:14.368 --> 01:19:21.909]  But, that's exactly what goes on here, is they're saying to everybody, you're not allowed to be against anything Obama does, or you're a racist.
[01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:31.972]  They're playing a race car brutally, and viciously, and coldly, knowing that's not what it's about, and actually creating racial division.
[01:19:32.632 --> 01:19:34.274]  And it's doing that successfully.
[01:19:34.314 --> 01:19:34.954]  Stay there, Terry.
[01:19:34.974 --> 01:19:36.395]  I'm going to come back to you after the break.
[01:19:36.756 --> 01:19:38.557]  But I want to be able to say bye to Robert here at the end.
[01:19:38.617 --> 01:19:40.239]  Robert, your comment on this.
[01:19:40.319 --> 01:19:41.780]  Is this a desperation move?
[01:19:43.061 --> 01:19:45.784]  They will try anything in order to reach their goal.
[01:19:47.765 --> 01:19:54.171]  But you can't really interpret what they're saying because they use a lot of disinformation.
[01:19:55.231 --> 01:20:01.635]  And so there's always a motive behind what they're doing, but it's not an apparent one.
[01:20:01.995 --> 01:20:04.657]  But the majority of white Americans voted for Obama.
[01:20:04.937 --> 01:20:09.299]  His approval rating has dropped by 30-something points because he lied about everything.
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:14.282]  But I saw a segment, someone emailed me a long talk.
[01:20:14.903 --> 01:20:20.826]  It was on YouTube by this black preacher that he says, look out, don't trust these guys.
[01:20:20.846 --> 01:20:23.668]  One of these days the white guys are going to come up
[01:20:24.304 --> 01:20:29.286]  Well look, they put Obama in there to make it about race.
[01:20:29.306 --> 01:20:30.807]  They put him in there to create division.
[01:20:39.351 --> 01:20:43.854]  If he was a black guy that was trying to end the Federal Reserve, they'd assassinate him.
[01:20:44.054 --> 01:20:44.375]  That's right.
[01:20:44.435 --> 01:20:46.376]  Just like if he was a white guy, they'd assassinate him.
[01:21:08.831 --> 01:21:09.031]  800-410-5571 800-410-5571
[01:21:28.914 --> 01:21:31.835]  Or for anybody that wants to interview you, they can also call that number.
[01:21:31.975 --> 01:21:32.315]  That's correct.
[01:21:32.335 --> 01:21:33.996]  We look forward to talking to you again soon.
[01:21:34.016 --> 01:21:36.917]  Another fellow Central Texan fighting the New World Order.
[01:21:38.257 --> 01:21:40.058]  And again, we're just all evil racists here.
[01:21:40.138 --> 01:21:41.999]  We don't want them putting sodium fluoride in the water.
[01:21:42.019 --> 01:21:44.639]  And that's because we're racist.
[01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:46.080]  We're on the march.
[01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:48.161]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:49.121 --> 01:21:51.782]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:54.548 --> 01:21:58.551]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:21:58.792 --> 01:22:00.593]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:22:00.793 --> 01:22:09.080]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:22:09.321 --> 01:22:14.545]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:22:14.865 --> 01:22:16.487]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:22:16.727 --> 01:22:23.049]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:22:23.249 --> 01:22:33.993]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:22:34.293 --> 01:22:34.793]  That's right.
[01:22:35.053 --> 01:22:37.374]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:22:37.634 --> 01:22:39.194]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[01:22:41.555 --> 01:22:56.801]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[01:22:57.121 --> 01:23:00.562]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:02.643]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:23:03.043 --> 01:23:05.964]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:23:06.265 --> 01:23:09.686]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's
[01:23:10.026 --> 01:23:10.386]  We're good.
[01:23:40.046 --> 01:23:40.246]  We're good.
[01:23:55.507 --> 01:23:59.248]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[01:23:59.388 --> 01:24:09.230]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned, pure, handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.

[01:24:37.419 --> 01:24:38.641]  Don't take my word for it.

[01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:53.623]  You will never use anything else again.
[01:25:00.526 --> 01:25:02.448]  You know, we had Robert on today.
[01:25:03.049 --> 01:25:07.173]  I took a lot of calls earlier, but we really should just suspend guests for the next few weeks.
[01:25:08.895 --> 01:25:16.924]  Except for medical doctors who talk about the flu, because there's so much going on and the listeners are what are interesting and informative and entertaining.
[01:25:18.166 --> 01:25:20.749]  But our main goal is here to awaken people and
[01:25:22.597 --> 01:25:28.464]  Again, to me, it is the racism to make it a racial issue if you disagree with the President.
[01:25:28.964 --> 01:25:30.586]  And they're cold-bloodedly doing this.
[01:25:30.846 --> 01:25:35.291]  Chris Matthews and Jimmy Carter, they know what they're doing.
[01:25:36.212 --> 01:25:36.773]  They know.
[01:25:36.873 --> 01:25:42.940]  It makes them the moral authority, and then you're the racist because you're out protesting because the President
[01:25:44.462 --> 01:25:46.003]  Yeah, Alex, what I was saying is that
[01:25:59.370 --> 01:26:10.698]  Uh, the media, everything that's done, I mean, whether it's the tea parties, the protests, where all types of independents and everybody is mixed in together, well, they'll turn it into a racial thing.
[01:26:10.718 --> 01:26:13.520]  They'll say, well, it's all, you know, it's racism.
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:16.362]  These people are against Obama because he's black.
[01:26:16.642 --> 01:26:23.767]  It's not that, you know, any of these people could love liberty or love freedom or don't want to go to a socialistic state.
[01:26:24.227 --> 01:26:25.388]  It can't be any of that.
[01:26:25.508 --> 01:26:27.269]  It's got to be because he's black.
[01:26:27.629 --> 01:26:34.875]  And then that makes it difficult for the people who always get their news from the mainstream media, especially minorities and blacks.
[01:26:35.115 --> 01:26:47.124]  When you try to come to them with a message about what is truly going on in our government and the world, then they have a wall up because they believe that it's all about a racist agenda.
[01:26:47.704 --> 01:26:52.528]  So you can't get a hedge through to try and open their eyes to what's going on.
[01:26:53.388 --> 01:26:55.050]  And it's really frustrating.
[01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:56.851]  I tell you, it's really frustrating.
[01:26:57.432 --> 01:27:01.535]  And I have come out, I have been out of the closet when Obama was a candidate.
[01:27:02.255 --> 01:27:11.841]  I'm calling all other liberty, freedom Americans, freedom loving Americans, blacks, minorities, to come out of the closet with me.
[01:27:13.142 --> 01:27:16.163]  Because they're turning this thing into a white thing.
[01:27:16.944 --> 01:27:21.767]  Well they want us at each other's throats because look, you've got a tiny, it's very simple.
[01:27:22.657 --> 01:27:43.713]  You've got a tiny group of bankers who are eugenicists and who hate everybody, who are putting stuff in the water to sterilize us, trying to force deadly inoculations on us, stealing $23.7 trillion, setting up a world government, and it's in white people's interest and black people's interest and Asian's interest and
[01:27:45.103 --> 01:27:56.806]  It doesn't matter who you are, 99% of us, it's in our interest to not go along with this world government and the end of the dollar and all the things they're openly doing.
[01:27:57.606 --> 01:28:07.568]  Now, if we're getting mad at the Federal Reserve, we're wanting to abolish the Federal Reserve, the American people are coming together, the establishment's going to say, Tribal Warfare!
[01:28:08.188 --> 01:28:09.228]  Fight with each other!
[01:28:09.628 --> 01:28:12.269]  That's the exact way that the British Crown
[01:28:13.303 --> 01:28:17.346]  Divided the natives and was able to take over the United States.
[01:28:17.526 --> 01:28:20.968]  And then what the army was able to do was play tribe off against tribe.
[01:28:21.428 --> 01:28:23.390]  There's only a few thousand globalists.
[01:28:23.770 --> 01:28:26.011]  How are they going to beat 7 billion people?
[01:28:26.332 --> 01:28:27.953]  We're almost 7 billion on the planet now.
[01:28:28.573 --> 01:28:35.338]  They're gonna do it by divide-and-conquer, by balkanization, and they're just cold-bloodedly doing it.
[01:28:35.738 --> 01:28:44.204]  Anybody who isn't a racist, or anybody who's got half a brain, sees this and is insulted by it, going, I'm not racist, why are you bringing up race?
[01:28:45.694 --> 01:28:49.776]  That's why I'm calling on all African Americans, the ones who have their eyes open, to stand up.
[01:29:12.697 --> 01:29:20.922]  Because once we stand up, and then the people see that there are other blacks who are saying something against Obama, they can't call us racist.
[01:29:21.983 --> 01:29:22.623]  I hear you.
[01:29:22.643 --> 01:29:24.244]  Well, what are these people talking about?
[01:29:24.544 --> 01:29:26.085]  And then they'll get to the issues.
[01:29:27.266 --> 01:29:27.686]  Exactly.
[01:29:27.726 --> 01:29:28.247]  God bless you.
[01:29:28.267 --> 01:29:28.767]  Good points.
[01:29:29.467 --> 01:29:36.712]  You should write up an article and send it to writers at Infowars.com and make those points, because it needs to be made by black folks.
[01:29:38.826 --> 01:29:39.787]  It's a total diversion.
[01:29:40.187 --> 01:29:45.551]  But now we're having a debate, and we have to have a debate, about how ridiculous this is to say it's racial.
[01:29:46.372 --> 01:29:53.297]  And sure, out of two million people there, there were probably a couple hundred thousand that don't like Obama because he's black.
[01:29:53.977 --> 01:29:56.559]  But I'll guarantee you they don't like him for a bunch of other reasons too.
[01:29:57.580 --> 01:29:58.701]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:29:58.801 --> 01:30:02.464]  Obama... I've gotten emails, when I say Obama's a puppet,
[01:30:03.513 --> 01:30:06.695]  And I've seen it on MySpace, and I've seen it on YouTube.
[01:30:07.396 --> 01:30:09.357]  People say, oh, you're just racist.
[01:30:10.097 --> 01:30:11.078]  And it's usually white people.
[01:30:11.098 --> 01:30:13.360]  You can click on their channel name and go to their page.
[01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:18.483]  You don't like a black man being over you, so you're saying he's a puppet.
[01:30:18.503 --> 01:30:20.805]  No, I said George Bush Sr.
[01:30:20.845 --> 01:30:26.669]  was a puppet, Bill Clinton was a puppet, George Bush was a puppet, because they are a puppet.
[01:30:27.409 --> 01:30:30.791]  And I'm actually giving Obama cover here, because it's true.
[01:30:31.232 --> 01:30:32.773]  He doesn't deserve all the blame.
[01:30:33.786 --> 01:30:35.147]  George Bush was evil.
[01:30:35.567 --> 01:30:36.988]  Probably a lot more evil than Obama.
[01:30:37.689 --> 01:30:39.250]  George Bush enjoyed what he was doing.
[01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:42.812]  I mean, as a man, I like Obama more than I like Bush.
[01:30:42.872 --> 01:30:45.094]  I mean, Bush radiated evil.
[01:30:46.374 --> 01:30:47.555]  Radiated corruption.
[01:30:47.975 --> 01:30:48.776]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:30:49.136 --> 01:30:52.939]  The very same, even more evil groups are in control of him.
[01:30:54.517 --> 01:30:59.401]  But the system cold-bloodedly knows this is just meant for all of us to get at each other's throats!
[01:31:00.142 --> 01:31:05.906]  While the Federal Reserve steals three times all the mortgages in the country.
[01:31:07.328 --> 01:31:12.232]  All the mortgages in the country were $9.4 trillion, Bloomberg reported.
[01:31:12.952 --> 01:31:13.793]  So what's three times $9.4?
[01:31:13.833 --> 01:31:16.835]  $9 trillion, $9 trillion is $18 trillion.
[01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:22.222]  And then you add another nine to that.
[01:31:23.003 --> 01:31:23.944]  Yeah, you're right at it.
[01:31:24.044 --> 01:31:27.988]  It's 24.3, 23.7, but it's really going to be about 28 now.
[01:31:28.809 --> 01:31:35.396]  So you're right at three times all the mortgages in the country is what we gave foreign banks.
[01:31:37.298 --> 01:31:39.240]  Now, are all your mortgages paid off?
[01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:40.721]  See, that's the thing.
[01:31:41.142 --> 01:31:47.808]  All these liberals think you're going to have socialism and that, well, if David Rockefeller's got a hundred billion bucks, I'm going to get part of it.
[01:31:48.148 --> 01:31:49.569]  You're not going to get any of that money.
[01:31:49.589 --> 01:31:57.677]  David Rockefeller supports socialism because they're going to take the guy making $100,000 money and they're going to give it all to the ultra-rich.
[01:31:59.713 --> 01:32:15.058]  I have a great graphics guy and I said make me a wealth redistribution graphic and I wasn't specific and he brought me one of a red house that says a million dollars on it and you got three greenhouses that are smaller that were poor people.
[01:32:15.894 --> 01:32:21.336]  And in his graphic, it shows the red house get littler, and the green houses get bigger.
[01:32:21.717 --> 01:32:22.477]  And I said, no.
[01:32:23.037 --> 01:32:31.021]  You need to make another graphic of that red house turning into a green house, a smaller house, and all the other houses getting even smaller.
[01:32:31.421 --> 01:32:33.682]  And then a big pyramid above it getting bigger.
[01:32:34.522 --> 01:32:37.644]  It sucks all the money up out of us into them!
[01:32:37.664 --> 01:32:40.065]  I mean, it's so simple.
[01:32:42.526 --> 01:32:45.989]  And it's going to get worse, and worse, and worse.
[01:32:46.449 --> 01:32:53.134]  Mexico has more billionaires per capita, for 100 million people, population, than any other country in the world.
[01:32:54.175 --> 01:32:56.897]  And they're also the third poorest country in the world.
[01:32:56.917 --> 01:33:00.240]  Depending on which gauge you look at, fifth poorest.
[01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:02.501]  The point is, they're in the top five poorest countries.
[01:33:03.102 --> 01:33:06.444]  They got more resources than we got, but they got a corrupt elite.
[01:33:06.825 --> 01:33:07.845]  Same thing with Africa.
[01:33:08.166 --> 01:33:09.326]  Same thing with Eastern Europe.
[01:33:09.787 --> 01:33:10.948]  Same thing, I mean folks,
[01:33:12.150 --> 01:33:15.333]  The boss hogs don't want you to have a nice life.
[01:33:15.833 --> 01:33:19.537]  They want to shut you down politically so they can control you.
[01:33:19.577 --> 01:33:30.166]  They want to use the economy to make you poor so you're so busy just trying to get enough food to eat that you're not busy getting uppity.
[01:33:32.808 --> 01:33:33.849]  But it is outrageous.
[01:33:33.889 --> 01:33:36.272]  I mean, Jimmy Carter, I've respected some things he's done.
[01:33:37.981 --> 01:33:42.784]  But I have to remember he's a Trilateral Commission co-founder with David Rockefeller and he is a eugenicist.
[01:33:42.804 --> 01:33:51.569]  You know, again, Barack Obama took the abortion funding block off for black kids in Africa and forced abortion in China.
[01:33:52.190 --> 01:33:55.892]  And if you think killing black babies is pro-black, then you're idiots.
[01:33:56.633 --> 01:34:06.619]  And I saw footage of a Hispanic man at an Obama event in Spanish holding up pictures of
[01:34:07.802 --> 01:34:17.648]  Dead babies to the Hispanics, and Hispanics were coming over getting in his face, saying he was anti-Hispanic because he didn't like Obama, because he didn't want Hispanics killing Hispanic babies.
[01:34:18.128 --> 01:34:20.510]  What is your major problem?
[01:34:20.910 --> 01:34:24.592]  Killing your babies isn't good!
[01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:30.236]  It's the Margaret Sanger phony liberals that are the real racists.
[01:34:30.656 --> 01:34:36.460]  When are you going to figure it out that a real racist doesn't run up missing their front teeth in a Klan hood?
[01:34:37.423 --> 01:34:44.498]  When are you going to figure out that there are some of those racists, but they are confined to their shacks and aren't a threat to you?
[01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:46.783]  Unless you're caught in their neighborhood at 3 a.m.
[01:34:49.471 --> 01:34:57.858]  The real threat is the George Soros's, is the Ted Turner's, is the David Rockefeller's, is the Bill and Melinda Gates.
[01:34:58.339 --> 01:35:01.482]  These people want your ass dettered in a hammer.
[01:35:01.782 --> 01:35:03.063]  And you know who their man is?
[01:35:03.383 --> 01:35:04.404]  He's Barack Obama.
[01:35:04.664 --> 01:35:08.087]  Because they know if they put a black face on this, you're going to go along with it.
[01:35:08.348 --> 01:35:09.629]  And I am sick of it!
[01:35:10.069 --> 01:35:10.990]  I'm tired of it!
[01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:12.011]  It's so obvious!
[01:35:15.094 --> 01:35:16.175]  Man, I'm tired of it!
[01:35:17.096 --> 01:35:17.597]  But you know what?
[01:35:17.637 --> 01:35:18.339]  It's not going to work.
[01:35:18.579 --> 01:35:21.124]  Calling everybody racist and dragging racism out.
[01:35:21.745 --> 01:35:23.529]  Let me tell you how stuff really works.
[01:35:24.731 --> 01:35:26.054]  Most white people are guilty.
[01:35:27.242 --> 01:35:28.843]  And this isn't even targeting black folks.
[01:35:28.883 --> 01:35:37.248]  This is targeting guilty whites to be afraid to criticize anything Obama's doing, gun control, you name it, because they don't want to be called racist.
[01:35:37.708 --> 01:35:45.172]  And what the left is doing is using up the term racism so when it really needs to be used against somebody who's really racist, nobody's going to want to hear it anymore.
[01:35:45.432 --> 01:35:49.615]  It's like Israel calling everybody an anti-Semite who doesn't agree with every policy they've got.
[01:35:49.975 --> 01:35:51.716]  Now that term doesn't work anymore.
[01:35:53.357 --> 01:35:53.537]  So,
[01:35:56.095 --> 01:35:57.176]  It's cheapening the term.
[01:35:58.617 --> 01:36:00.139]  David in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:36:00.159 --> 01:36:02.501]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:36:02.901 --> 01:36:05.824]  Listen, I work in finance and got a few quick stories for you.
[01:36:06.084 --> 01:36:14.491]  We had a client of ours go down to a major bank downtown Houston to cash out, you know, a little over a hundred grand in cash.
[01:36:15.332 --> 01:36:19.416]  And they didn't have it on hand and he had to wait a week and got
[01:36:20.307 --> 01:36:23.189]  Well, also, they fill out a suspicious transaction report.
[01:36:23.209 --> 01:36:29.233]  I mean, do people really think the FBI for $5,000 wasn't already watching Governor Spitzer?
[01:36:29.253 --> 01:36:30.013]  They're watching everybody.
[01:36:49.735 --> 01:37:10.406]  You know, in the brokerage community, there's a lot of, you know, since the Patriot Act, we have to fill out a lot of paperwork for new accounts that ask a lot of questions, you know, where's the money coming from, so on and so forth, and all those are set up as profiles, and then every so often, those are ran against these terrorist databases and all that stuff, and that's, you know, pretty mainstream.
[01:37:10.426 --> 01:37:12.547]  The people that work in the industry, they know that.
[01:37:12.567 --> 01:37:15.268]  Yes, Patriot Act compliance has nothing to do with terror.
[01:37:15.668 --> 01:37:16.408]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:23.242]  Another point, it's very funny, I was at a dinner last night with some folks from J.P.
[01:37:23.282 --> 01:37:30.165]  Morgan and I'll tell you the cluelessness out there, in professionals, is outstanding.
[01:37:31.325 --> 01:37:35.807]  This woman, 30 years in the business, worked, you know, fund manager for J.P.
[01:37:35.847 --> 01:37:42.370]  Morgan, talking just general economic stuff and, you know, of course people bring up inflation
[01:37:43.103 --> 01:37:47.625]  You know, she just passes it off like it's not a problem and it may actually be a good thing.
[01:37:47.806 --> 01:37:52.548]  And she's like, well, you know, we don't have high inflation because CPI is real low.
[01:37:52.808 --> 01:37:55.910]  And of course I bring up the point... But they cook the CPI!
[01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:59.212]  Real unemployment's at 20% and they're telling us it's at 10!
[01:38:00.956 --> 01:38:07.657]  And I said, well, if you think there's no inflation, how come gold is four times higher than it was ten years ago?
[01:38:07.817 --> 01:38:12.798]  And if you price the Dow in gold, it cost 40 ounces of gold to buy it in 2000.
[01:38:12.838 --> 01:38:14.918]  Now it costs like 9.8 ounces.
[01:38:14.999 --> 01:38:19.739]  So if you didn't quadruple your money in stocks, you lost purchasing power.
[01:38:20.019 --> 01:38:21.660]  And she said, well, that doesn't matter.
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:22.880]  We're not on a gold standard.
[01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:24.120]  You know, gold's just a commodity.
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:24.640]  Who cares?
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:26.801]  But look at every other, look at oil.
[01:38:26.841 --> 01:38:28.801]  We're paying a lot more than we were ten years ago for that.
[01:38:31.688 --> 01:38:34.510]  Look, look, they can tell us that everything costs the same.
[01:38:35.011 --> 01:38:38.074]  Anybody who's been to the grocery store knows that's a load of bull.
[01:38:40.116 --> 01:38:43.119]  No, you're absolutely right, but it's just so hilarious to see.
[01:38:43.692 --> 01:38:48.073]  You know, professionals that don't even give it a second thought.
[01:38:48.733 --> 01:38:53.315]  And someone else brought up the point of, you know, she said she just came back from China.
[01:38:53.395 --> 01:38:55.495]  It's like working with the Sovereign Wealth Fund over there.
[01:38:56.056 --> 01:39:00.457]  And I said, well, what are they telling you about slowing down their T-bill purchases?
[01:39:00.737 --> 01:39:01.937]  Talking about world currency?
[01:39:01.957 --> 01:39:03.298]  I mean, it's in mainstream news.
[01:39:03.818 --> 01:39:06.899]  And she's just like, ah, you know, that will never happen.
[01:39:07.199 --> 01:39:08.439]  They have to buy T-bills.
[01:39:08.739 --> 01:39:09.740]  They can't do anything else.
[01:39:11.636 --> 01:39:12.576]  They're never going to stop.
[01:39:12.596 --> 01:39:13.276]  What are they going to do?
[01:39:13.417 --> 01:39:15.097]  I'm like, well, they don't have to.
[01:39:15.257 --> 01:39:16.697]  They can invest their money wherever they want to.
[01:39:16.738 --> 01:39:19.138]  Well, they've already for two years been cutting back.
[01:39:19.558 --> 01:39:20.539]  I appreciate your call.
[01:39:20.739 --> 01:39:21.459]  Great points, David.
[01:39:21.879 --> 01:39:29.901]  You get all these specialized people and they know their little niche and then that's it.
[01:39:31.382 --> 01:39:33.823]  And they think it's like an attribute that they don't care.
[01:39:33.863 --> 01:39:35.243]  They think it's cute or funny.
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:40.042]  And if you fight for your liberty, you're probably going to lose it.
[01:39:40.322 --> 01:39:42.504]  If you don't care about it, you're going to get run over.
[01:39:44.205 --> 01:39:45.506]  Manfred, Montana.
[01:39:45.546 --> 01:39:46.567]  Manfred, you're on the air.
[01:39:47.427 --> 01:39:47.807]  Hi, Alex.
[01:39:47.988 --> 01:39:49.168]  I've been listening to you for a year.
[01:39:49.228 --> 01:39:49.909]  First time caller.
[01:39:49.949 --> 01:39:51.790]  I just got out of the military also a year ago.
[01:39:53.171 --> 01:39:53.531]  Welcome.
[01:39:54.832 --> 01:39:55.232]  Thank you, sir.
[01:39:57.234 --> 01:40:01.417]  I've got a question about the votes, the ballots.
[01:40:02.177 --> 01:40:02.417]  Yes.
[01:40:04.844 --> 01:40:06.045]  Why can't we have nobody on there?
[01:40:06.265 --> 01:40:12.427]  I mean, every party starts with these great ideas about equality and all this other great jazz, but they always get corrupted.
[01:40:12.808 --> 01:40:14.628]  Why can't we just incorporate nobody on the bill?
[01:40:15.209 --> 01:40:29.535]  Well, the systems have never been perfect, but you have the very same special interests and the shadow government that's not even a shadow anymore, the National Security Council's advised by private interest, and they set the policy.
[01:40:29.635 --> 01:40:33.977]  If you hold politicians accountable on issues,
[01:40:35.546 --> 01:40:37.386]  Like Glenn Beck's a politician.
[01:40:38.787 --> 01:40:42.968]  He's for the banker bailout bill, but then after he gets it, he then says he's against it.
[01:40:43.708 --> 01:40:50.410]  See, so you've got to go off politicians' voting records, off of political pundits' records.
[01:40:50.850 --> 01:40:51.930]  Do they flip-flop?
[01:40:55.031 --> 01:40:58.252]  As bad as our system is, it's because it's been overthrown.
[01:40:59.537 --> 01:41:03.519]  A lot of people then want to create a new system, which will be even worse.
[01:41:03.619 --> 01:41:10.101]  It's that our original system, let's say you got a diesel engine, and you're putting rainwater in it and it's not starting.
[01:41:10.601 --> 01:41:14.103]  Well, it's not the diesel engine's fault, it's that you put the wrong fuel in it.
[01:41:14.123 --> 01:41:14.783]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:41:14.803 --> 01:41:16.044]  Yeah, I hear you, man.
[01:41:19.025 --> 01:41:19.945]  I don't disagree with that.
[01:41:20.585 --> 01:41:24.487]  But I think if we have nobody on the ballot, if nobody gets voted in,
[01:41:25.293 --> 01:41:29.336]  Then we have to start over with new candidates, with new ideas, and it embarrasses the parties.
[01:41:30.677 --> 01:41:36.521]  Well, I do think that, unless you're Ron Paul or a few other people, you need to be voted out.
[01:41:36.641 --> 01:41:40.883]  Both parties, all this Republican grandstanding, I see right through it.
[01:41:40.903 --> 01:41:42.184]  I appreciate your call, Manfred.
[01:41:42.865 --> 01:41:44.786]  Joseph in California, go ahead.
[01:41:44.806 --> 01:41:46.547]  Hello?
[01:41:47.188 --> 01:41:47.368]  Yes.
[01:41:48.723 --> 01:42:01.491]  Hi, I was just calling about, um, there's a big protest here in the Bay Area about the, uh, the universities, and they arrested them for unlawful assembly, saying that they're shoving the police, but there's nothing on the news about them shoving anybody.
[01:42:01.511 --> 01:42:07.415]  And it just seems like, you know, out here in the Bay Area, the First Amendment doesn't exist anymore.
[01:42:07.735 --> 01:42:16.400]  Like myself, I'm in a lawsuit against SFPD for, um, arresting me for public drunkenness when I was, in fact, sober.
[01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:17.781]  And I saw on your site, you're
[01:42:18.644 --> 01:42:21.767]  Um, addressing something about DUI and Prohibition Law.
[01:42:23.148 --> 01:42:26.771]  Well, yes, all over the world, police are suppressing free speech.
[01:42:27.371 --> 01:42:40.182]  Because they've been ordered to, because they know that they've tried to cow the public into submission, knowing the financial raping was about to happen, knowing we would rightfully take our government back.
[01:42:40.562 --> 01:42:43.364]  They don't want that image of slaves on the streets saying no.
[01:42:44.338 --> 01:42:48.740]  But as the police lose their pension funds too, they're going to end up joining us.
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:52.662]  So I would tell you take legal action against those that have violated your rights.
[01:42:53.242 --> 01:42:53.902]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:55.103 --> 01:42:58.124]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:42:58.485 --> 01:43:02.086]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:43:02.366 --> 01:43:05.828]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:43:06.108 --> 01:43:12.671]  At less than two cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine from
[01:43:15.097 --> 01:43:20.978]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.

[01:43:55.651 --> 01:44:00.974]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:01.694 --> 01:44:07.038]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:44:07.578 --> 01:44:13.722]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:14.062 --> 01:44:15.883]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:16.023 --> 01:44:18.405]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:44:18.485 --> 01:44:29.431]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:44:31.672 --> 01:44:32.993]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:33.353 --> 01:44:34.754]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:44:35.214 --> 01:44:41.438]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:42.108 --> 01:44:49.878]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:50.378 --> 01:44:51.520]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:53.142]  The people strike back!
[01:44:54.650 --> 01:44:58.953]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[01:44:59.173 --> 01:45:01.595]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[01:45:01.735 --> 01:45:02.495]  He was devastated.
[01:45:02.615 --> 01:45:11.281]  But it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[01:45:11.421 --> 01:45:17.305]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[01:45:17.625 --> 01:45:20.127]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[01:45:20.307 --> 01:45:22.688]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[01:45:23.849 --> 01:45:30.038]  And he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[01:45:30.438 --> 01:45:40.813]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[01:45:40.973 --> 01:45:44.934]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[01:45:45.014 --> 01:45:47.834]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[01:45:47.994 --> 01:45:51.615]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[01:45:51.775 --> 01:45:54.316]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[01:45:57.476 --> 01:46:03.537]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:46:04.117 --> 01:46:07.098]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:46:12.298 --> 01:46:12.858]  You know what?
[01:46:12.918 --> 01:46:13.919]  It's the end of the show.
[01:46:14.179 --> 01:46:16.041]  I got to a lot of the news I said I'd cover.
[01:46:16.081 --> 01:46:16.921]  Quite a bit I didn't.
[01:46:16.941 --> 01:46:19.323]  I know we got loaded phone lines.
[01:46:19.383 --> 01:46:20.484]  I want to hear from everybody.
[01:46:21.485 --> 01:46:26.308]  Tomorrow, I may just clear the decks of guests and just take phone calls.
[01:46:26.909 --> 01:46:30.892]  You've been doing a better job about taking your calls, but so much is happening.
[01:46:31.492 --> 01:46:37.457]  I also want to start focusing in on the flu, the reports from your areas as they're trying to force kids in schools to take it.
[01:46:38.177 --> 01:46:44.979]  This all starts in the next week and a half, two weeks, so we're going to be watching that, following that, got a bunch of medical doctors coming on.
[01:46:46.020 --> 01:47:02.225]  At the end of the show, I do also want to thank listeners for all of their support, and to remind you that we are listener supported by books and video sales, and we are carrying the new video that we're starting to ship out today, a few days early, it's not even officially out yet, Camp FEMA.
[01:47:02.685 --> 01:47:05.327]  That I consulted on and I'm the main featured person in.
[01:47:05.347 --> 01:47:06.747]  A lot of other great folks in it.

[01:48:52.597 --> 01:48:59.344]  And lastly here today, I want to thank FrontSite.com and Dr. Ignatius Piazza.
[01:49:00.025 --> 01:49:01.927]  He's got a great deal at FrontSite.com.
[01:49:03.379 --> 01:49:11.670]  You can get five days of world-class gun training at the Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-stake concealed weapons permit all for pennies on the dollar.
[01:49:11.690 --> 01:49:17.418]  And if you act fast, they will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:49:17.798 --> 01:49:20.141]  There's no drill instructor or tough guy attitude.
[01:49:20.181 --> 01:49:20.762]  It's the biggest
[01:49:21.423 --> 01:49:23.928]  Private shooting training facility in the country.
[01:49:24.268 --> 01:49:25.551]  FrontSite.com.
[01:49:25.631 --> 01:49:26.352]  Free newsletter.

[01:49:29.417 --> 01:49:31.361]  So be sure and visit FrontSite.com.
[01:49:31.702 --> 01:49:33.946]  It's not enough to just know how to use a firearm.
[01:49:36.630 --> 01:49:38.172]  It's not enough to just own a firearm.
[01:49:38.212 --> 01:49:39.773]  You need the proper training.
[01:49:40.014 --> 01:49:42.536]  You need to know more than just how to load it and point it and shoot it.
[01:49:42.897 --> 01:49:44.739]  And some people that buy guns don't even know that.
[01:49:45.119 --> 01:49:52.527]  So check them out at FrontSight.com and find out about getting your free XD armory pistol in the caliber of your choice at FrontSight.com.
[01:49:52.927 --> 01:49:55.851]  Okay, I'm very thankful also to our AM and FM affiliates.
[01:49:57.182 --> 01:50:05.305]  Please folks, be sure and support those local affiliates, and support our local sponsors as well, and continue to remember that we're reaching more and more people.
[01:50:05.345 --> 01:50:08.406]  We're changing history because of you spreading the word.
[01:50:08.927 --> 01:50:10.547]  And that's how this radio show grows.
[01:50:10.967 --> 01:50:17.450]  Whether you're listening on shortwave, satellite, the internet, at InfoWars.com, or your local AM or FM station, or the free podcast,
[01:50:18.010 --> 01:50:21.091]  Continue to tell your friends, your family, your neighbors about the show.
[01:50:21.411 --> 01:50:26.373]  Because if we expose what these globalist criminals are doing, their program will fall apart.
[01:50:26.453 --> 01:50:31.054]  If we don't, we're going to get a world government that makes the Nazis look like choir boys.
[01:50:31.074 --> 01:50:32.575]  Retransmission starts now.
[01:50:32.895 --> 01:50:34.055]  Infowars.com.
