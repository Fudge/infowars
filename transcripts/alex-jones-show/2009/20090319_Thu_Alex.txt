[00:00:01.607 --> 00:00:06.718]  Okay, we're going live right now at 1235 Central Standard Time at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:06.738 --> 00:00:09.022]  We'll be simulcasting from the show here on out.
[00:00:11.351 --> 00:00:13.833]  Back in 2000-2001, I had two employees.
[00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.935]  And so, tapes got stacked up.
[00:00:15.955 --> 00:00:16.895]  They didn't get labeled right.
[00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:17.596]  They went everywhere.
[00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:19.437]  Hundreds of important TV shows I did.
[00:00:20.258 --> 00:00:23.801]  And it's just gold, the information that's in these.
[00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:29.445]  And we're trying to go through these now to get them on the web, to, you know, get them out at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:29.505 --> 00:00:34.229]  But Mike Hanson, who did camera work for me, ran a local TV show at the time, I've asked him to dig through his stuff.
[00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:34.909]  He's done that.
[00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.113]  And because I've been unable to find this particular tape, he was able to find it.
[00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:43.517]  uh... in uh... his store of TV programs I did.
[00:00:43.837 --> 00:00:59.353]  Pay off for anti-gun testimony caught on tape by Alex Jones is the headline up at InfoWars.com and the reason this story is important we're going to play the video here is that
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:15.250]  Uh, Jews to Preservation of Firearms Ownerships, local director, we were there testifying against shutting down the gun shows, ending private sales, shutting down 4-H shooting clubs, YMCA shooting clubs for young people and children.
[00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:17.131]  That was the bills.
[00:01:19.053 --> 00:01:20.714]  And this is when I really woke up to the NRA.
[00:01:21.234 --> 00:01:22.095]  Seven years ago now.
[00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:26.198]  I guess eight years ago coming up.
[00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:28.139]  This was in early 2001.
[00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:37.752]  Because the NRA was calling us extremists for not wanting to shut down the gun shows and things.
[00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:40.394]  This was in the Dallas Morning News, attacking me and others.
[00:01:41.094 --> 00:01:43.236]  And then when we caught the bribery, they said, get out here.
[00:01:43.256 --> 00:01:46.678]  You know, they're, what looks like bribery, being paid off.
[00:01:46.778 --> 00:01:50.701]  And the House Ethics Committee said that he should have been a registered lobbyist, that it was improper.
[00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:55.584]  But then the investigation stopped there, and Hena Hoza, the committee chairman, did get reprimanded.
[00:01:56.424 --> 00:02:00.126]  But they get up and they say, yeah, basically there's dangerous gang members everywhere.
[00:02:01.327 --> 00:02:06.510]  Uh, and we've, you know, you need to restrict guns, you need to restrict gun shows.
[00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:14.054]  And then they go outside and this gun control group sits there and pays them off at least $300 a piece, the, uh, three guys that testified.
[00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:22.279]  And then the statesman called me the next day after we put the video out on local TV, I was live that night, and said, why don't you like black people?
[00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:24.080]  And I said, what are you talking about?
[00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.333]  Well, if those were white men being paid and testifying against the Second Amendment, would you have done your story?
[00:02:30.353 --> 00:02:32.154]  And I said, I wouldn't care if they were green.
[00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:34.236]  I mean, this is a non-issue.
[00:02:35.236 --> 00:02:38.939]  So the Statesman headline was, Payments Made to Backers of Gun Bills.
[00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.121]  And it was the cover of the Metro and State local section of the Austin American Statesman.
[00:02:44.902 --> 00:02:46.503]  And I said, are you kidding?
[00:02:46.523 --> 00:02:47.264]  And that was in the article.
[00:02:47.284 --> 00:02:48.564]  I said, are you kidding, sir?
[00:02:49.445 --> 00:02:50.546]  Are you joking with me?
[00:02:51.653 --> 00:02:53.936]  And I said, you know, don't say that in your article.
[00:02:53.976 --> 00:02:54.837]  That's not what this is about.
[00:02:54.877 --> 00:02:55.397]  But no, they did.
[00:02:55.417 --> 00:02:58.500]  It was all this Alex Jones racist because he showed black guys being paid.
[00:03:00.863 --> 00:03:02.765]  So it's an important article in that respect.
[00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:05.088]  And literally there's hundreds of reports.
[00:03:05.148 --> 00:03:06.089]  Just this is important.
[00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:10.674]  And I'm trying to make enough money to hire a person full time just to go through all my old videos.
[00:03:11.655 --> 00:03:13.036]  Because this is stuff that needs to be seen.
[00:03:14.011 --> 00:03:17.574]  He needs to flood YouTube and everywhere else and we'll use PrisonPlanet.tv to do that.
[00:03:18.594 --> 00:03:20.196]  But I want to thank Mike for digging through his stuff.
[00:03:20.216 --> 00:03:21.317]  I'd ask him to do that more.
[00:03:21.777 --> 00:03:24.959]  He's got his Mike Hanson Archive page up on YouTube.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.041]  And this video's been out for a few weeks.
[00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:28.962]  It was just emailed to me this morning and I saw it.
[00:03:29.723 --> 00:03:31.724]  So we're going to go ahead and play that here.
[00:03:31.784 --> 00:03:33.386]  Some of the testimony audio isn't the best.
[00:03:33.406 --> 00:03:34.546]  There's only a few minutes of that.
[00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:42.953]  But we'll boost the audio up so folks can hear it where they're testifying, basically demonizing the Second Amendment.
[00:03:44.076 --> 00:03:46.677]  And go, you know, play the part of, really it makes black folks look bad.
[00:03:46.717 --> 00:03:49.598]  The racism was putting them up there and going, yeah, we're gang members, yeah.
[00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.179]  You know, we've been gang members, yeah.
[00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.320]  The Second Amendment, you know, we need to get rid of these gun shows.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.000]  It's dangerous.
[00:03:55.341 --> 00:03:56.801]  It was really sick what they did.
[00:03:56.961 --> 00:03:58.802]  That was what was playing the race card.
[00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:02.004]  You know, like, ooh, here's the scary black guys, you know, and guns.
[00:04:02.924 --> 00:04:03.624]  It was disgusting.
[00:04:03.664 --> 00:04:05.725]  And they were very thuggish once we talked to them outside.
[00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:07.706]  You'll see that video at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:04:08.226 --> 00:04:09.507]  And also hear it over the radio.
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.602]  This is one of the guys involved in the Million Mom March here in Texas.
[00:04:16.102 --> 00:04:21.926]  Just a disgusting episode, but I've always wanted to play this when we had the bandwidth to put it out for everybody at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:21.946 --> 00:04:23.026]  So here it is.
[00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:28.149]  We're going to have the state police officer on in about five minutes from now.
[00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:31.031]  So here is the video and the audio.
[00:04:37.734 --> 00:04:39.916]  So, you guys were paid for your testimony?
[00:04:40.116 --> 00:04:40.336]  Nope.
[00:04:40.376 --> 00:04:42.457]  Well, we just saw the gentleman give you money.
[00:04:43.037 --> 00:04:43.878]  Hey, it doesn't matter.
[00:04:43.918 --> 00:04:47.360]  Traveling expenses, baby.
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.962]  So, you guys were the Million Mile March?
[00:04:50.182 --> 00:04:50.622]  No.
[00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:53.744]  Who are you with this camera in?
[00:04:53.804 --> 00:04:57.527]  No, he's the guy who has some Austin show.
[00:04:57.607 --> 00:04:59.128]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:04:59.308 --> 00:05:02.510]  No, actually, it's campaign contributions.
[00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.391]  Campaign contributions.
[00:05:04.551 --> 00:05:06.832]  Man, nobody's getting paid for nothing.
[00:05:06.852 --> 00:05:08.693]  What I said in there, that's what I feel.
[00:05:08.733 --> 00:05:09.894]  Well, I mean, who gave you the money?
[00:05:10.854 --> 00:05:11.355]  It doesn't matter.
[00:05:11.375 --> 00:05:12.215]  The money I've been at.
[00:05:12.235 --> 00:05:12.935]  I got money all over me.
[00:05:12.955 --> 00:05:13.836]  Looks like quite a bill I saw.
[00:05:13.876 --> 00:05:14.756]  This gentleman giving you money?
[00:05:15.137 --> 00:05:17.758]  I gave him traveling expenses.
[00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:20.680]  And I saw you testify, sir.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.563]  You were here with Nina Butts, funded by George Soros, the foreign currency speculator.
[00:05:27.777 --> 00:05:29.018]  So this is how business is done.
[00:05:29.118 --> 00:05:29.678]  And who are you?
[00:05:30.118 --> 00:05:30.998]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:32.119]  Oh, hi Alex.
[00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:33.199]  I know him.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.521]  Firearm purchaser and seller to miners.
[00:05:36.801 --> 00:05:37.081]  Yeah.
[00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:37.921]  Oh, really?
[00:05:37.941 --> 00:05:39.142]  I didn't know I was in that business.
[00:05:39.182 --> 00:05:40.402]  I thought I was a radio talk show host.
[00:05:40.823 --> 00:05:41.043]  Yeah.
[00:05:41.403 --> 00:05:41.823]  But really?
[00:05:41.863 --> 00:05:42.884]  Oh, that's an effective deal.
[00:05:42.904 --> 00:05:43.464]  Yeah.
[00:05:43.764 --> 00:05:45.305]  So you guys are taking over the country now, right?
[00:05:45.325 --> 00:05:45.405]  Yeah.
[00:05:45.425 --> 00:05:45.525]  Nope.
[00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:46.145]  You are, dude.
[00:05:46.525 --> 00:05:47.145]  You are, dude.
[00:05:47.205 --> 00:05:48.726]  Just as soon as people are disarmed, right?
[00:05:49.026 --> 00:05:49.606]  Just like Hitler.
[00:05:50.307 --> 00:05:50.527]  Right.
[00:05:51.007 --> 00:05:52.488]  So how much did he pay you?
[00:05:52.508 --> 00:05:53.808]  It looked like thousands to me.
[00:05:54.108 --> 00:05:54.489]  It was.
[00:05:54.549 --> 00:05:54.709]  It was $20,000.
[00:05:56.002 --> 00:05:57.883]  Well, I saw wads of 20s and 100s.
[00:05:57.983 --> 00:05:59.664]  I had to get my camera.
[00:05:59.684 --> 00:06:00.725]  I was across the hall there.
[00:06:00.765 --> 00:06:01.705]  You better go buy a gun with that, man.
[00:06:01.745 --> 00:06:02.846]  The police told us about it.
[00:06:02.886 --> 00:06:06.348]  We better go buy a lot of guns and we're gonna come back and sell them to the NRA.
[00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:08.449]  Hey, we're making this show hotter than it's already.
[00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:09.990]  Remember, Hitler was for gun control, guys.
[00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.231]  Hitler was for gun control.
[00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:13.652]  And if I ever catch him on my block, I'm gonna shoot him.
[00:06:13.752 --> 00:06:14.553]  For real.
[00:06:15.773 --> 00:06:18.415]  So how did the Million Mom March get in touch with you?
[00:06:18.495 --> 00:06:19.716]  We're not even a mob.
[00:06:19.776 --> 00:06:20.516]  Oh really?
[00:06:20.576 --> 00:06:22.898]  You said the name of a group you were with.
[00:06:22.918 --> 00:06:26.140]  Young Texans Against Gun Violence, baby.
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.800]  Recognized.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.161]  And you get paid to do it, huh?
[00:06:28.501 --> 00:06:28.661]  Nope.
[00:06:28.962 --> 00:06:29.922]  We get a stipend.
[00:06:29.942 --> 00:06:31.383]  We get a stipend for volunteering.
[00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:31.943]  From who?
[00:06:31.964 --> 00:06:34.205]  From that old man?
[00:06:34.245 --> 00:06:35.986]  That old man's our best friend.
[00:06:36.066 --> 00:06:38.728]  Campaign contribution.
[00:06:38.828 --> 00:06:40.209]  It's not my son.
[00:06:44.713 --> 00:06:46.454]  You just call little kids names.
[00:06:46.494 --> 00:06:53.996]  That's... You don't want to lose your 4-8 shooting club, do you?
[00:06:54.176 --> 00:06:54.856]  No, I don't.
[00:06:54.916 --> 00:06:58.577]  Well, there's a little bandage where they won't be able to train you how to shoot.
[00:06:58.737 --> 00:06:59.537]  And that's their goal.
[00:07:00.017 --> 00:07:02.018]  Yep.
[00:07:02.258 --> 00:07:03.839]  And so you guys are the 4-8 shooting club.
[00:07:03.859 --> 00:07:04.839]  It's unbelievable.
[00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:08.072]  You've been waiting all day and they wouldn't even let anybody talk.
[00:07:08.112 --> 00:07:09.913]  So they had all the Nina Butz's up there first.
[00:07:10.093 --> 00:07:10.714]  Unbelievable.
[00:07:11.054 --> 00:07:12.835]  I saw you paying those people off.
[00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:13.435]  Your guy.
[00:07:13.935 --> 00:07:15.456]  Paying those guys from the Houston 100s.
[00:07:15.536 --> 00:07:16.277]  Excuse me.
[00:07:16.537 --> 00:07:17.057]  Excuse me.
[00:07:17.817 --> 00:07:17.977]  Really?
[00:07:18.318 --> 00:07:19.298]  I don't have $100.
[00:07:19.398 --> 00:07:20.139]  I caught you on tape.
[00:07:20.179 --> 00:07:20.939]  I caught him on tape.
[00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:21.739]  You're caught, baby.
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:22.380]  Really?
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.320]  Yeah.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.521]  Who are you talking about?
[00:07:27.276 --> 00:07:27.957]  What did you see?
[00:07:27.997 --> 00:07:30.379]  Because across the hall I saw wads of money.
[00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:31.419]  I ran to get the camera.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.242]  I missed it and I came back and I thought he hid the money.
[00:07:35.323 --> 00:07:42.448]  She told me that the woman... We went over there and he was counting them out.
[00:07:42.548 --> 00:07:43.869]  I saw hundreds and twenties.
[00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:48.142]  We think he gave each guy like $400, right?
[00:07:48.162 --> 00:07:50.484]  Well no, he just said all I saw was $400 and I saw him count out.
[00:07:50.584 --> 00:07:54.827]  Um, a lot of you guys are looking from the outside in.
[00:07:54.987 --> 00:07:57.128]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:07:57.949 --> 00:08:02.752]  You guys are looking in on the situation and you guys are living it day to day.
[00:08:02.772 --> 00:08:10.317]  I have friends who sell guns, who buy guns from people, who go to the gun shows and get guns at large quantities.
[00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:13.439]  You know, I mean, I know all these people.
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.360]  I live them.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.221]  Well, this is going on.
[00:08:17.942 --> 00:08:24.525]  I mean, you guys might think that there's already you already have everything under control, but it's not.
[00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:28.827]  I mean, regardless of if we pass this law or not.
[00:08:29.988 --> 00:08:31.569]  I mean, things might change, but this
[00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:36.455]  This right here, this bill, all three of these bills, this is just the beginning.
[00:08:36.655 --> 00:08:43.644]  Because there's bigger threats out there and there's bigger laws that we need to focus on that are being enforced in America.
[00:08:44.064 --> 00:08:51.774]  But these three House bills right here, this is just the beginning and I'm all for it.
[00:08:53.653 --> 00:08:58.816]  And like I said, you guys are looking, most of you guys are looking out, from the outside.
[00:08:59.096 --> 00:09:01.238]  Because I'm there, I'm there every day.
[00:09:01.598 --> 00:09:06.200]  We've gone into researching, I don't even want to know where these companies are located at, none of that.
[00:09:06.821 --> 00:09:09.663]  But... But then what makes you think that they're selling because of you?
[00:09:09.743 --> 00:09:12.124]  Because, that's the only... Who else is gonna give?
[00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:15.586]  They don't have a factory in the hood where they're making guns.
[00:09:16.086 --> 00:09:18.368]  You don't think some of those guns might be stolen?
[00:09:19.368 --> 00:09:20.069]  They're not, man.
[00:09:20.109 --> 00:09:25.292]  How can... Where are you going to get so much stolen guns from?
[00:09:25.432 --> 00:09:27.773]  From 200 houses maybe, or 10 houses.
[00:09:27.793 --> 00:09:33.757]  See, nobody says, alright, nobody... So, I'm sorry, just wanted to clarify.
[00:09:34.337 --> 00:09:39.240]  I think what I'm hearing you saying that at least one source of these guns on the street is the gun shop.
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:39.520]  Yes.
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.381]  Thank you.
[00:09:41.954 --> 00:09:46.535]  First question I would like to ask is, do we have an epidemic of gun violence?
[00:09:46.575 --> 00:09:57.538]  Because the proponents of the legislation have delayed the very well-intended and sincere testimony of the Maroon 5 march members and others, which leads to believe we have an epidemic of gun violence.
[00:09:57.738 --> 00:09:58.718]  That is not the case.
[00:09:58.938 --> 00:10:01.779]  Texas and the United States are safer than they have ever been.
[00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:10.461]  I won't go into detail, but if you look through the clipping file here that has information from the National Center for Health Statistics and the Centers for Disease Control,
[00:10:12.603 --> 00:10:15.766]  Payments made to backers of gun bills!
[00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:31.434]  Questions arise over cash given to three witnesses who support gun show background checks.
[00:10:31.814 --> 00:10:43.804]  Proponents of gun owners' rights asked Lawmakers Friday to investigate cash payments made to three Houston men who appeared before a House committee this week to support bills that would require instant background checks at gun shows.
[00:10:44.165 --> 00:10:47.588]  Dave Smith, president of Houston-based Texans for Gun Safety,
[00:10:48.268 --> 00:11:01.612]  A known front that is funded by Hanger Control Incorporated said he gave the three members of Young Texans Against Gun Violence, Nina Butz's group is Texans Against Gun Violence, about $300 each to cover their expenses and lost wages for the trip.
[00:11:02.012 --> 00:11:05.453]  All three men, however, said they are currently unemployed.
[00:11:06.394 --> 00:11:08.074]  So, they can't get their lives straight.
[00:11:08.094 --> 00:11:09.415]  That's lie number four right there.
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.343]  It was reimbursement for their jobs, but they're unemployed.
[00:11:14.683 --> 00:11:20.290]  Otarius Kelly 20, one of the witnesses said, it is ridiculous that someone would raise concerns about their testimony.
[00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:22.472]  It's against my morals, Kelly said.
[00:11:22.933 --> 00:11:28.700]  An admitted gang member, by the way, in the Houston Chronicle, there's another story about this in there.
[00:11:29.901 --> 00:11:30.961]  Another witness agreed.
[00:11:31.101 --> 00:11:40.004]  The money that was given to us was not to change our testimony, said Bruce Brown, 18, who did not speak to the committee, but submitted a witness form that showed he supported the bills.
[00:11:40.404 --> 00:11:47.286]  Smith, who gave the men the cash just outside the committee hearing room, said Young Texans Against Gun Violence is an arm of his group.
[00:11:47.606 --> 00:11:52.108]  The subsidiary group receives donations from the Catholic Campaign for Human Development,
[00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:54.233]  And the Alliance for Justice.
[00:11:54.794 --> 00:11:58.998]  Those groups encourage young people to get experience in the political process, Smith said.
[00:11:59.018 --> 00:11:59.838]  Yeah, right.
[00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:08.026]  Reimbursing witnesses for travel expenses is not unusual, said Susie Woodford of Common Cause Texas, a group that monitors government ethics.
[00:12:08.386 --> 00:12:13.111]  But she said other witnesses using cash and paying for witnesses, time raises ethical questions.
[00:12:13.671 --> 00:12:17.595]  It totally undermines the witnesses' credibility, Woodford said.
[00:12:20.074 --> 00:12:23.017]  I got here, I said, how will this look?
[00:12:23.417 --> 00:12:37.208]  It says, complaints about the payments began circulating after Austin-based talk show host Alex Jones, who was at the House Criminal Jurisprudence Committee meeting Tuesday, aired videotaped interviews with Smith and the young men.
[00:12:37.529 --> 00:12:41.852]  They told Jones the money was reimbursement, stipends and campaign contributions.
[00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:43.750]  Three different stories.
[00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.351]  It's like the famous scene in a movie.
[00:12:45.371 --> 00:12:46.311]  Where are you guys going?
[00:12:47.312 --> 00:12:47.872]  What are you doing?
[00:12:48.792 --> 00:12:49.572]  Going to see my mother.
[00:12:49.992 --> 00:12:51.333]  Going to get something to eat.
[00:12:51.413 --> 00:12:52.373]  Going to the moon.
[00:12:52.933 --> 00:12:54.074]  It's just making it up.
[00:12:54.474 --> 00:13:02.617]  Head of Gun Owners Alliance has asked his thousands of members to seek a house investigation of the payments and to have the hearing disregarded.
[00:13:03.217 --> 00:13:06.079]  Smith said complaints are being raised because the young men are minorities.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:12.544]  Jones, a strong supporter of gun owners' rights, said Smith was trying to cover up his dirty activities by making accusations of racism.
[00:13:12.844 --> 00:13:22.251]  He's sitting here, caught on tape, throwing out different stories and giving out money, said Jones, who mentioned the payments during his testimony against the proposal to require background checks at gun shows.
[00:13:22.691 --> 00:13:25.733]  How dare he try to divert attention by saying I'm a racist?
[00:13:26.053 --> 00:13:29.316]  Committee members Rick Green, R. Dripping Springs, and Juan Hena-Hoza
[00:13:29.756 --> 00:13:34.658]  McAllen said they were uneasy about taking Jones seriously because of other inflammatory comments he has made.
[00:13:34.678 --> 00:13:42.440]  Hinojosa, the chairman of the committee, said that although he didn't know details about the payments, he is not concerned if the witnesses are compensated for testifying.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:47.042]  Hinojosa said lobbyists are compensated for their work to influence policy on behalf of other interests.
[00:13:47.442 --> 00:13:51.783]  Maybe these kids were paid for their travel, but I don't see anything improper about it, Hinojosa said.
[00:13:51.803 --> 00:13:53.143]  It is part of the process.
[00:13:53.183 --> 00:13:54.264]  It is part of open government.
[00:13:54.964 --> 00:14:04.447]  State law requires people who are paid more than $1,000 in three months or who spend more than $500 a quarter trying to influence legislation or agency action to register as lobbyists.
[00:14:04.707 --> 00:14:06.728]  So you broke the state election laws, bud.
[00:14:07.048 --> 00:14:07.828]  You're not a lobbyist.
[00:14:07.848 --> 00:14:08.348]  We checked.
[00:14:09.028 --> 00:14:14.470]  Smith said not reimbursing witnesses for lost wages would mean average Texans would be left out of legislative debates.
[00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.071]  And he said cash made sense.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.402]  All right, we're back live at PrisonPlanet.tv simulcasting on the radio here.
[00:14:23.383 --> 00:14:25.404]  And this is my first time talking to him.
[00:14:25.604 --> 00:14:27.045]  My producers talked to him many times.
[00:14:27.065 --> 00:14:27.885]  We've set him up for the show.
[00:14:27.905 --> 00:14:30.186]  I'm not even going to say which state police agency he's from.
[00:14:30.526 --> 00:14:35.189]  We've gotten this from several states, more than several different variants in the last few months.
[00:14:35.989 --> 00:14:36.950]  We're going to call him David.
[00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.830]  That's not his name.
[00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:44.494]  That sent us the MIAC strategic report that has gotten national and international
[00:14:45.154 --> 00:14:45.594]  Attention.
[00:14:45.614 --> 00:14:50.495]  In fact, the MIAC report was here in my stack and then Jason was in here last night doing a show.
[00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:51.575]  I'll have to dig it out.
[00:14:51.615 --> 00:14:52.876]  Here is the MIAC report.
[00:14:54.516 --> 00:14:55.116]  No, that's not it.
[00:14:55.136 --> 00:14:58.697]  Well, the point is it's up on Infowars.com and everywhere else.
[00:15:00.737 --> 00:15:02.698]  No, that's a copy of the MIAC report.
[00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:03.458]  Oh, there it is.
[00:15:03.498 --> 00:15:03.698]  Good.
[00:15:03.918 --> 00:15:05.918]  Folks, it's so crazy in here setting up guests.
[00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:12.240]  I was just talking to Ron Paul's office and then after that I was talking to
[00:15:15.131 --> 00:15:19.893]  Chuck Baldwin's office just now and setting up the state police officer right now.
[00:15:19.913 --> 00:15:21.894]  What I'm going to do is I'm just going to come back from break.
[00:15:22.214 --> 00:15:36.221]  We're going to push Oath Keepers back to about 15 after next hour if I have time to talk on air to the state police officer and restart what I was just covering here with the MIAC report because I got on air and realized I wanted the MIAC report and found it here in the disheveled stack.
[00:15:37.261 --> 00:15:39.863]  So we're going to talk to David, state police officer.
[00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:41.765]  It's not his name, folks.
[00:15:41.785 --> 00:15:47.274]  When we come back, directly from the gentleman that sent us this, one of the gentlemen that sent us this, stay with us.
[00:15:49.784 --> 00:15:55.847]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[00:15:55.947 --> 00:16:01.949]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:07.672]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:16:08.112 --> 00:16:10.213]  Starve or surrender.
[00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:14.415]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:16:14.875 --> 00:16:15.776]  What then?
[00:16:18.493 --> 00:16:21.314]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:16:21.554 --> 00:16:25.735]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[00:16:25.896 --> 00:16:28.716]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.

[00:16:35.979 --> 00:16:37.760]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:43.261]  And now you can go into business with Big John at SurvivalistSeeds.com by becoming an affiliate.

[00:16:49.446 --> 00:16:54.682]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:16:55.476 --> 00:17:00.818]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:17:01.358 --> 00:17:07.540]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.661]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:12.201]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:23.165]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:17:25.476 --> 00:17:26.737]  It's not about left or right.
[00:17:27.137 --> 00:17:28.538]  It's about a one world government.
[00:17:28.998 --> 00:17:35.321]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:17:44.165 --> 00:17:45.326]  The Obama Deception.
[00:17:45.746 --> 00:17:46.927]  The people strike back.
[00:17:48.536 --> 00:17:56.621]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:17:56.781 --> 00:18:01.184]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:18:01.344 --> 00:18:05.867]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:18:06.027 --> 00:18:07.848]  It's a documented fact.
[00:18:08.309 --> 00:18:14.933]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:18:15.093 --> 00:18:17.975]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals,
[00:18:18.115 --> 00:18:18.616]  I think so.
[00:18:43.536 --> 00:18:43.837]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:18:57.572 --> 00:19:03.874]  Last Wednesday, we broke a report separately sent to us by two separate state police officers in two different states.
[00:19:04.474 --> 00:19:06.975]  MYAC Strategic Report, the modern militia.
[00:19:06.995 --> 00:19:10.195]  This is federally written to the fusion centers, distributed all over the country.
[00:19:10.215 --> 00:19:12.336]  This is the Missouri version with the governor's seal on it.
[00:19:12.936 --> 00:19:15.437]  We've got state reps on that have talked to the head of the state police there.
[00:19:16.357 --> 00:19:17.637]  The commander, it's true.
[00:19:17.798 --> 00:19:18.278]  They admit it.
[00:19:18.318 --> 00:19:18.838]  They back it.
[00:19:18.878 --> 00:19:19.478]  They support it.
[00:19:20.358 --> 00:19:28.621]  We've interviewed and called and played clips with the state police captain in charge at MIAC.
[00:19:29.081 --> 00:19:29.822]  This is real.
[00:19:30.082 --> 00:19:31.982]  And now, Limbach's covered it.
[00:19:32.022 --> 00:19:32.943]  Rush Limbaugh's covered it.
[00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:33.903]  We've confirmed those clips.
[00:19:33.963 --> 00:19:34.923]  I've watched them during breaks.
[00:19:35.063 --> 00:19:36.704]  It is a huge story and it should be.
[00:19:37.024 --> 00:19:39.945]  But these and other variants like them go out everywhere.
[00:19:40.125 --> 00:19:42.566]  We're joined by David, the current state police officer.
[00:19:42.586 --> 00:19:43.546]  We're just going to leave it at that.
[00:19:43.906 --> 00:19:45.207]  Not even tell you what state he's in.
[00:19:46.167 --> 00:19:55.352]  And have him tell the story of what it's like to have these in the department, other reports they've had, what other officers are saying and what it's like to see this blown up so big.
[00:19:55.672 --> 00:20:00.975]  We appreciate his courage because they do have retribution against officers and they talk about that in here if it gets out.
[00:20:01.595 --> 00:20:07.498]  Sir, we appreciate you upholding your oath to protect and defend the Bill of Rights and Constitution that so many have fought and died for.
[00:20:07.518 --> 00:20:08.479]  Thank you so much, officer.
[00:20:09.579 --> 00:20:10.380]  You're quite welcome, Alex.
[00:20:12.054 --> 00:20:17.456]  Okay, uh, tell us when you first got this and what it was like reading it and what other officers are saying.
[00:20:17.476 --> 00:20:38.585]  Well, they emailed it to all the aerial officers and officers and it's like a training thing, you know, and when I pulled it up on the screen, at first I was in disbelief after I read it and I had to read it a couple of times to understand what are they saying?
[00:20:38.625 --> 00:20:39.485]  I thought it was a spoof.
[00:20:41.946 --> 00:21:00.231]  When I read it, when I ran it past a few other officers, you know, and they had the same twist that I had on it, that they were actually saying that some of us were militia members, that we belong to a militia group just because, as myself, I have a Ron Paul sticker on my car.
[00:21:01.152 --> 00:21:09.174]  Some other officers, they believe that gun control is not correct and that we shouldn't be marking up bullets, ammunition,
[00:21:09.844 --> 00:21:16.769]  Act that they're trying to pass through, and listen, wait a minute, this is like a big net taking in everybody.
[00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:24.936]  You know, it just doesn't, it didn't appear right, and it seemed like this thing was just anti-American all the way.
[00:21:25.396 --> 00:21:27.558]  It really, it really made me mad.
[00:21:29.879 --> 00:21:35.323]  So the majority of other officers that you talked to in your state police office, they were upset by it just like you?
[00:21:36.444 --> 00:21:36.985]  Yes, they were.
[00:21:39.028 --> 00:21:43.830]  I'm telling you, I'm talking about officers that are Kool-Aid drinking officers.
[00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:46.951]  I mean, officers that back Bush all the way.
[00:21:47.111 --> 00:21:50.572]  Even they were very upset by this document.
[00:21:50.592 --> 00:21:52.113]  They said, nah, this can't be true.
[00:21:52.133 --> 00:22:03.537]  You know, and a few of them looked at the author of the article and they said, well, of course, that this is probably what comes out of this agency.
[00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:12.673]  Yeah, we decided to go with your cell phone because it doesn't have a good connection and kind of distorts your voice, but it's doing its job too well right now.
[00:22:12.733 --> 00:22:16.614]  So just, I guess maybe speak a little bit louder for us, officer.
[00:22:16.634 --> 00:22:22.315]  I don't want to give out any details about where you are or how senior you are, but we just appreciate, again, your courage coming on.
[00:22:22.816 --> 00:22:24.656]  How long ago did you first get emailed this?
[00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:26.617]  It came out in the 20th of February.
[00:22:26.657 --> 00:22:27.457]  Was it around that time?
[00:22:29.317 --> 00:22:31.938]  I got it about a week after the 20th.
[00:22:32.816 --> 00:22:33.716]  That's when I opened it.
[00:22:34.037 --> 00:22:43.261]  And it took me that long to digest what was actually on this document and really interpret what they were trying to tell us.
[00:22:45.262 --> 00:22:45.782]  Yes, I do agree.
[00:23:02.538 --> 00:23:02.979]  Exactly.
[00:23:05.821 --> 00:23:07.483]  Amazing guilt by association.
[00:23:08.303 --> 00:23:12.507]  And then they show American flags, and the don't tread on me, and that's used by most of the military.
[00:23:12.567 --> 00:23:13.969]  It's bad if you got that on your car.
[00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:15.670]  Look out for folks with these bumper stickers.
[00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:20.535]  We're going to come back in one minute, sir, 70 second break, and get into, is this profiling?
[00:23:21.175 --> 00:23:23.537]  What is this meant to do when they give this to the state police?
[00:23:24.979 --> 00:23:28.142]  And is this why we see state police across the country harassing Ron Paul people?
[00:23:31.181 --> 00:23:32.742]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:23:45.353 --> 00:23:48.116]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.

[00:23:51.359 --> 00:23:56.083]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:23:56.303 --> 00:23:57.243]  If you simply prepare.
[00:23:57.423 --> 00:24:00.405]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:24:00.665 --> 00:24:07.568]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[00:24:41.733 --> 00:24:43.634]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:44.114 --> 00:24:46.995]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:53.338 --> 00:24:53.979]  Big Brother.
[00:24:54.639 --> 00:24:55.699]  Mainstream media.
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.540]  Government cover-ups.
[00:24:58.181 --> 00:24:58.981]  You want answers?
[00:24:59.741 --> 00:25:00.682]  Well, so does he.
[00:25:01.322 --> 00:25:05.064]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:25:05.484 --> 00:25:09.546]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:25:11.612 --> 00:25:14.433]  We are back live, now already into our number three.
[00:25:14.453 --> 00:25:20.796]  In about 15 minutes we've got Oath Keepers, a group for police, military, and others are saying we're going to uphold the Constitutional Bill of Rights.
[00:25:21.716 --> 00:25:29.740]  Very well written, very well done site because it's a constitutional lawyer that started it, but a lot of police and military have joined and pledged their oath to protect and defend the Constitutional Bill of Rights.
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:34.482]  We've got a gentleman on the line right now, state police officer, we'll just call him David, that's not his name.
[00:25:35.862 --> 00:25:39.484]  His name has been changed to protect the innocent, those defending the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:25:40.484 --> 00:25:42.285]  We're talking about the MIAC strategic report.
[00:25:42.305 --> 00:25:43.305]  Here's the report he sent me.
[00:25:43.725 --> 00:25:45.626]  Got it up on screen right here for you as well.
[00:25:46.146 --> 00:25:47.447]  The story is now huge.
[00:25:49.048 --> 00:25:49.688]  Profiling!
[00:25:49.708 --> 00:25:51.809]  I mean, they admit this is sent out to state police.
[00:25:51.849 --> 00:25:53.049]  It was sent to your state police.
[00:25:56.051 --> 00:25:57.951]  This is going all over the country, that's confirmed.
[00:25:58.652 --> 00:26:01.953]  We're not going to get into that though, because that can get into where you're at.
[00:26:04.586 --> 00:26:07.808]  And, I mean, what has this meant to give patrol officers this?
[00:26:07.828 --> 00:26:18.172]  Because they talk about when they pull you over, you know, if you see these bumper stickers, if you see this, if you see that, they start the whole page out with cop killing, I guess to prejudice the police, but it doesn't look like it's working too well.
[00:26:18.212 --> 00:26:22.954]  So is this profiling and demonizing anybody that disagrees with the government?
[00:26:24.715 --> 00:26:26.356]  Actually, I believe it is.
[00:26:27.376 --> 00:26:29.357]  I believe that is the intent.
[00:26:29.917 --> 00:26:32.819]  But I don't think it's going to work.
[00:26:34.076 --> 00:26:45.121]  Officers in my agency can see through this ruse, and they understand that this document is meant to enslave the American people, and I don't think it's going to work.
[00:26:45.881 --> 00:26:47.282]  I think it misses the mark.
[00:26:47.922 --> 00:26:48.863]  It's so obvious.
[00:26:48.883 --> 00:26:55.005]  It's so obvious to lean one way to be a net that encompasses everybody.
[00:26:55.045 --> 00:27:03.469]  Like I said, even though I don't have that right-wing, left-wing, false paradigm, but even the right-wingers in my
[00:27:04.315 --> 00:27:06.076]  Well, they're certainly losing now.
[00:27:06.096 --> 00:27:13.001]  Congressman Ron Paul, former Congressman Bob Barr, and presidential candidates are saying they're going to sue if they don't retract this.
[00:27:13.061 --> 00:27:13.261]  Right.
[00:27:34.491 --> 00:27:37.472]  What they're trying to do, they're trying to train the young officers.
[00:27:38.352 --> 00:27:41.052]  I mean, the really young, impressionable officers.
[00:27:41.533 --> 00:27:47.734]  But they don't understand, these young officers that are coming into these departments, a lot of them are really smart and sharp.
[00:27:47.834 --> 00:27:49.414]  They're coming in with four-year degrees.
[00:27:50.515 --> 00:27:56.356]  I know a couple of attorneys that have just started the department, and they can see through this, Alex.
[00:27:57.356 --> 00:27:59.296]  I think these people are running scared now.
[00:27:59.376 --> 00:28:00.997]  I think you and your office
[00:28:02.193 --> 00:28:08.498]  And people like you have done such a great job informing the American public that people are seeing through these people.
[00:28:09.318 --> 00:28:11.580]  The American citizens are seeing through these people.
[00:28:12.621 --> 00:28:16.423]  What type of things were the state police officers in your office saying when they read this?
[00:28:19.626 --> 00:28:21.187]  They were in disbelief.
[00:28:21.987 --> 00:28:29.573]  They said, hey, I like guns just like any other American likes guns and I'm not letting nobody take my gun.
[00:28:32.515 --> 00:28:41.321]  And the ammunitions and, you know, like the 223 round and the 308 that Obama wants to get rid of, they say, no, it's not going to happen.
[00:28:41.842 --> 00:28:45.824]  They say, when they come to get, well, I mean, the statements are getting really bad.
[00:28:45.864 --> 00:28:48.666]  They said, they're going to have a hard time getting my weapon from me.
[00:28:49.427 --> 00:28:50.388]  And I say the same thing.
[00:28:50.908 --> 00:28:55.331]  You're not getting my weapon unless you pry it out of my cold, dead hand.
[00:28:55.891 --> 00:28:56.632]  I'm not giving it up.
[00:28:59.696 --> 00:29:04.357]  I mean, would you say 90% of the police, the other state police officers you work with are like this?
[00:29:04.417 --> 00:29:04.517]  Or 50%?
[00:29:04.957 --> 00:29:11.359]  And you're saying if the statements are getting like, sounds like you're saying bordering on, we're going to resist this.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:28.164]  I would say 80 to 90% of the officers that I spoke to, and that's at like 80 officers, 90 officers, are saying, no, this is not going to work.
[00:29:30.453 --> 00:29:30.793]  Stay there.
[00:29:30.813 --> 00:29:35.658]  Let's recap that when we come back and get into anything else you want to cover and your take on this story getting so big.
[00:29:35.718 --> 00:29:36.439]  It should get big.
[00:29:36.459 --> 00:29:41.123]  This is outrageous and it's public now because your courage and other state police officers' courage.
[00:29:41.504 --> 00:29:46.889]  Because this outraged police so bad, we got two copies of this from two different states, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:47.189 --> 00:29:47.569]  Stay with us.
[00:29:47.589 --> 00:29:48.130]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:59.220]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:00.761]  Garden in a Can!

[00:30:39.344 --> 00:30:42.706]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:30:54.765 --> 00:31:00.110]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:06.835]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:07.135 --> 00:31:08.957]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:09.117 --> 00:31:11.499]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:11.579 --> 00:31:22.468]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:24.759 --> 00:31:26.000]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.820]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:34.623]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:32:36.747 --> 00:32:39.509]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:00.809 --> 00:33:06.558]  Foreign offshore banks are engaging in a corporate takeover of the United States, just like they've done to hundreds of third world countries.
[00:33:06.578 --> 00:33:07.339]  That's all that's happening.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.287]  They're announcing, I've got Reuters, world taxes on everything you do to private banks.
[00:33:13.433 --> 00:33:15.234]  It's all over the news, there's a new world order.
[00:33:15.274 --> 00:33:24.937]  So what happens when the state police and police open up these federally written reports saying none of this exists, you're a violent cop-killer if you talk about it?
[00:33:25.617 --> 00:33:32.059]  If people have these bumper stickers, look out, and we have out of Las Vegas the footage of them pulling somebody over, what's that Ron Paul sticker on your car?
[00:33:32.119 --> 00:33:35.020]  I guess that's the 10% the officer's talking about that I guess buy this.
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:41.223]  We've got Abby Newman being pulled over at a checkpoint, and she's got a pocket Constitution, and they grab it and say, is this legal?
[00:33:41.263 --> 00:33:48.747]  And on the squad car video, they have a discussion about if she's allowed to have it, when all it is is what this country's founded on, what they swear an oath to.
[00:33:49.647 --> 00:33:53.689]  Officer, specifically, you know, the New World Order is becoming big news now.
[00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:57.111]  I would imagine the officers, you say, are getting upset.
[00:33:57.131 --> 00:33:59.732]  I mean, are they going, wait a minute, they're admitting there's a New World Order.
[00:34:00.153 --> 00:34:04.475]  Why are they then saying you're a cop killer, basically, if you talk about a New World Order?
[00:34:06.924 --> 00:34:10.167]  I don't know exactly why I think that they're reaching.
[00:34:10.207 --> 00:34:12.789]  I think they're in desperation right now.
[00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:15.672]  They understand that they're being exposed.
[00:34:16.833 --> 00:34:18.214]  It's like the Obama deception.
[00:34:18.294 --> 00:34:21.337]  I watched it the other day, and I can't even make enough copies.
[00:34:21.377 --> 00:34:29.984]  I have officers coming up to me and saying, hey John, David, I understand that you have this film about Obama.
[00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:33.050]  I can't even keep copies.
[00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:36.651]  I've got to make copies constantly of the Obama deception.
[00:34:36.831 --> 00:34:42.314]  And by the way, I wish you guys sent out my DVDs so I could make better copies.
[00:34:42.494 --> 00:34:42.814]  We have!
[00:34:42.854 --> 00:34:49.618]  They're shipping right now, but imagine we had thousands of orders, we've got four people back there since Monday, just packaging, packaging, so it's on the way.
[00:34:50.738 --> 00:34:57.701]  And another thing, Alex, since I've been listening to you, probably since the end of 2005,
[00:34:59.224 --> 00:35:04.067]  And luckily I have, because you have saved me in literally hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:35:04.667 --> 00:35:07.989]  You got me out of the stock market for your guests.
[00:35:08.629 --> 00:35:11.651]  I've sold my own before the market crashed.
[00:35:11.711 --> 00:35:19.195]  And all of these things, the other officers realize, and I tell them, you know, Alex Jones has saved me money.
[00:35:19.515 --> 00:35:21.296]  And so that pushes them to you.
[00:35:21.796 --> 00:35:27.559]  And now the Obama deception, and now this, my document is further pushing people towards
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:32.763]  Your show, your radio show, because they know that you're giving out the truth.
[00:35:35.064 --> 00:35:44.729]  Why do you think people were in denial, even state reps and people that know I tell the truth, when they first saw it, they couldn't believe it, then they called the state police and they said, yeah, that's our document, we're proud of it.
[00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:49.452]  Well, it was so over the top, you know.
[00:35:50.692 --> 00:35:52.033]  It's like there's a quickening.
[00:35:52.932 --> 00:35:53.292]  No, I am.
[00:36:12.915 --> 00:36:17.319]  Well, what happens, you know, with tipping points in history is they can tip into evil or tip into good.
[00:36:18.119 --> 00:36:31.330]  And because we've done the groundwork and warned people, and because we were right about what was going to happen and what was going to develop, and people have seen that in hindsight with my 22 films and the work we've done, but countless others out there fighting, that we have a fighting chance in this.
[00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:33.832]  But people need to know, the enemy will stage terror attacks.
[00:36:34.352 --> 00:36:36.474]  The enemy will release bio-plagues.
[00:36:36.534 --> 00:36:37.995]  I mean, these people are hardcore killers.
[00:36:38.035 --> 00:36:40.337]  They funded Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Lenin.
[00:36:41.178 --> 00:36:47.223]  Pol Pot, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Obama's chief advisor, brags in two books he wrote about how they did it.
[00:36:47.243 --> 00:36:48.364]  I mean, these people are sick!
[00:36:49.284 --> 00:36:52.727]  And, so just because people are waking up, I don't want people to think we're out of this.
[00:36:52.787 --> 00:36:57.791]  This is deep, this is serious, and the new world order is going to hurt everybody out there.
[00:36:57.811 --> 00:36:59.713]  You know, I've made mistakes in the past.
[00:36:59.773 --> 00:37:00.714]  I had a primitive level.
[00:37:02.415 --> 00:37:04.937]  I get threatened.
[00:37:07.875 --> 00:37:09.055]  I agree with you.
[00:37:37.159 --> 00:37:42.824]  I know what side I'm on, and a lot of the police officers I talk to, they know what side they're on.
[00:37:43.345 --> 00:37:47.308]  And I tell them that, you know, you're gonna have a choice to make one day.
[00:37:47.328 --> 00:37:51.312]  You're gonna be asked to do some horrible things, and you have to think about it right now.
[00:37:51.392 --> 00:37:53.834]  Are you going to take people's guns away from them?
[00:37:54.134 --> 00:37:57.117]  Are you going to force people into cattle cars?
[00:37:57.477 --> 00:37:58.458]  Remember what Hitler did.
[00:37:59.626 --> 00:38:10.836]  I impressed upon at least the young officers, the old officers, they understand what's going on, where this country is going, and they understand they have to wake up and they have to be on the side of America.
[00:38:11.576 --> 00:38:19.303]  And we took an oath, and I remind these people that this oath is for our country.
[00:38:19.784 --> 00:38:22.086]  We have to defend this Constitution.
[00:38:22.546 --> 00:38:26.069]  This is the best Constitution in the world, and we have to keep it in force.
[00:38:28.234 --> 00:38:41.441]  Yeah, basically this report takes the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, everything good and wholesome, and then just spray paints white supremacist cop killer all over it in an attempt to demonize the very heart of this country.
[00:38:41.982 --> 00:38:56.370]  It's asinine, it's a fraud, and I am just buoyed by the fact that so many police and military are waking up, not from my information, but from the over-the-top nature of the criminal fed government's propaganda.
[00:38:58.191 --> 00:39:03.976]  Right, and coupled with what Obama's doing right now, he's doing what you predicted he would do.
[00:39:03.996 --> 00:39:08.779]  I mean, with his gun control, he's doing exactly what you're saying.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:14.324]  He's trying to stop us from having 2-2-3 rounds, from having 3-0-8 rounds, and this is nuts.
[00:39:14.684 --> 00:39:15.545]  It's not going to work.
[00:39:17.159 --> 00:39:20.660]  Well, I mean, I'd like to brag and say I'm real smart, but I'm really not.
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:27.561]  I just go off what the white papers in government and corporations say they're going to do, versus what they publicly say on the news.
[00:39:27.921 --> 00:39:29.601]  I mean, my job's like reading a TV guide.
[00:39:30.341 --> 00:39:44.384]  I mean, the UN, on July 7th, 2001, at the UNITER meeting in New York with thousands in attendance, said, we're going to take every civilian-owned firearm, period, single-shot, black powder, we're going to take all of it.
[00:39:45.797 --> 00:39:47.578]  So, you know, that's their goal.
[00:39:48.378 --> 00:39:49.719]  And so we're just laying it out.
[00:39:49.759 --> 00:39:53.880]  I mean, now the veterans found out that Obama was planning to make them get their own insurance.
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:59.602]  I mean, the people are finding out that it's a bunch of made-off criminals.
[00:39:59.983 --> 00:40:04.744]  The state police in your organization, I mean, are they aware of the banker takeover and how that's a scam as well?
[00:40:06.285 --> 00:40:07.145]  Well, not quite.
[00:40:07.405 --> 00:40:09.346]  That's a little too esoteric for them.
[00:40:09.406 --> 00:40:10.887]  I tried to explain to some of them.
[00:40:11.867 --> 00:40:13.268]  Some of them get it some way.
[00:40:14.761 --> 00:40:17.063]  Portions of it, but they don't get it totally.
[00:40:20.546 --> 00:40:23.848]  That's a little bit of a difficult role to hold.
[00:40:27.511 --> 00:40:34.937]  But you're saying on the Second Amendment issue, and because of the document, cop killer, white supremacist, we've got to restrict guns, you know, they mix that in, they saw through that?
[00:40:36.218 --> 00:40:37.840]  Right, they saw clearly through that.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:43.124]  Because, like I said, a lot of them, almost majority of them, you know,
[00:40:43.871 --> 00:40:58.037]  They have guns, they have rifles, they go to ranges, they shoot, and I guess some of them are called gun nuts, you know, and they're not going to get their guns, they're not.
[00:40:58.137 --> 00:41:08.101]  But they are trying to hire a bunch of social worker, mainline liberal types who are anti-gun-to-be-police, but once they get into the culture, it is a pro-Second Amendment, pro-self-defense culture.
[00:41:08.121 --> 00:41:11.623]  I mean, the 10% that are brainwashed, what are they like?
[00:41:14.009 --> 00:41:28.403]  A few of them are Obama supporters, and a couple of them I know mainly because they're wives, and they get harassed for it.
[00:41:28.523 --> 00:41:31.586]  It's kind of hard to have a cookie cutter for them.
[00:41:31.606 --> 00:41:32.527]  It runs the gamut.
[00:41:33.448 --> 00:41:34.990]  They could be left and right.
[00:41:39.209 --> 00:41:43.192]  Well, but I mean, you're saying that ten percent, though, are just buying this.
[00:41:43.232 --> 00:41:48.895]  I mean, they get a thing saying basically Ron Paul supporters are terrorists, libertarians are terrorists, and they just, they buy that.
[00:41:51.157 --> 00:41:51.597]  They buy it.
[00:41:51.717 --> 00:41:52.517]  About ten percent.
[00:41:52.557 --> 00:41:53.558]  But they get harassed.
[00:41:54.359 --> 00:41:54.879]  You know?
[00:41:55.159 --> 00:41:58.541]  Wake up, you know?
[00:41:58.561 --> 00:42:01.103]  You know, the other officers, they harass them about it.
[00:42:01.623 --> 00:42:02.904]  Come on, you guys gotta wake up.
[00:42:02.984 --> 00:42:07.747]  This one article, and actually it sits right on my briefing table.
[00:42:08.603 --> 00:42:14.170]  In the briefing room, and so people view it every day and make fun of it.
[00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:19.276]  This was, I think, the coup de grace for the New World Order.
[00:42:20.417 --> 00:42:22.299]  At least in this little battle.
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:28.026]  This is waking a lot of people up as to what's really going on in this country.
[00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:40.677]  Well, I think the police I talk to are starting to realize, too, that it's not going to be a fun job trying to disarm the American people, because 10% of gun owners are a lot of them are veterans.
[00:42:41.398 --> 00:42:43.279]  They're not happy about life, the economy.
[00:42:43.939 --> 00:42:50.003]  If 10% of 140 million gun owners fight back, we're talking about 10 million, 14 million people.
[00:42:50.023 --> 00:42:54.527]  I mean, do the police ever talk about what it would be like to try to go out and confiscate guns?
[00:42:56.488 --> 00:42:56.908]  No.
[00:42:58.589 --> 00:42:59.350]  Not specifically.
[00:43:01.358 --> 00:43:03.019]  I don't think it's going to come.
[00:43:03.039 --> 00:43:04.760]  They don't think it's going to come to that.
[00:43:05.521 --> 00:43:09.783]  But I try to put that little thought in their head, so they at least think about it.
[00:43:09.843 --> 00:43:15.446]  So when that decision does arrive, at least they have thought about it.
[00:43:16.487 --> 00:43:26.012]  Well, they'll keep doing it incrementally, but I just hope that officers are supposed to judge the law as well as the facts, have wide discretion, because I've run over the law.
[00:43:29.042 --> 00:43:31.924]  I know most police are pro-Second Amendment because they understand guns, they're not stupid.
[00:43:32.264 --> 00:43:40.810]  But then you've got that other type, where you can be in the countryside now in East Texas, walking across the road to your land to go bird hunting, a cop will pull up and say, what's that shotgun for?
[00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:43.832]  So, there's certainly that percentage, that 10%.
[00:43:43.892 --> 00:43:48.155]  Well, I mean, I'm sure you've heard about Ron Paul supporters that have been harassed, and now we know why.
[00:43:48.175 --> 00:43:50.036]  Well, why do you have a Ron Paul sticker?
[00:43:50.056 --> 00:43:51.117]  Well, why are you asking?
[00:43:54.153 --> 00:43:58.616]  Yes, I have heard about Ron Paul supporters, since I am one, being harassed.
[00:43:58.676 --> 00:44:06.162]  And so, before, like you said, I have one of these, Jason Burma said, keep a tape recorder with you.
[00:44:06.202 --> 00:44:07.923]  And I do keep a tape recorder in my car.
[00:44:07.983 --> 00:44:16.749]  And yeah, and I do carry a badge and everything, but I still keep a tape recorder because, hey, this conversation goes downhill.
[00:44:16.929 --> 00:44:19.231]  I want verifiable proof that
[00:44:19.804 --> 00:44:24.106]  I would stop illegally for a Ron Paul sign on the back of my car.
[00:44:24.466 --> 00:44:26.407]  Well, officer, this has been an amazing discussion.
[00:44:26.447 --> 00:44:33.229]  We salute your courage and what you've done, and I want to get you back in the next few weeks for a longer interview here on the show.
[00:44:33.329 --> 00:44:34.970]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:38.091]  You're welcome, and thank you for all the hard work.
[00:44:38.631 --> 00:44:39.312]  God bless you.
[00:44:39.952 --> 00:44:43.493]  All right, there he goes, state police officer and unnamed state David.
[00:44:43.513 --> 00:44:45.934]  We're going to come back and go to Stuart Rhodes with Oath Keepers.
[00:44:45.974 --> 00:44:47.535]  Thank you so much for joining us, sir.
[00:44:49.656 --> 00:44:53.238]  Do you have trouble sleeping due to sensations in your legs?

[00:46:27.176 --> 00:46:28.817]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:46:52.435 --> 00:46:54.559]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:47:02.072]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:08.823]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:47:09.223 --> 00:47:11.064]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:47:11.204 --> 00:47:13.605]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:47:13.705 --> 00:47:24.490]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:47:25.268 --> 00:47:26.569]  It's not about left or right.
[00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:28.351]  It's about a one world government.
[00:47:28.791 --> 00:47:35.137]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:47:35.718 --> 00:47:43.485]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:47:43.965 --> 00:47:45.126]  The Obama Deception.
[00:47:45.547 --> 00:47:46.748]  The people strike back.
[00:47:48.502 --> 00:47:51.544]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:47:51.984 --> 00:47:55.267]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:47:55.747 --> 00:48:01.691]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:48:02.071 --> 00:48:06.214]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:48:06.694 --> 00:48:12.418]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:48:12.718 --> 00:48:15.720]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:48:18.442 --> 00:48:18.782]  I think so.
[00:48:52.006 --> 00:48:52.526]  Don't worry.
[00:48:52.986 --> 00:48:54.467]  This show is documented.
[00:48:55.007 --> 00:48:57.787]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:48:58.187 --> 00:49:01.708]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:49:02.128 --> 00:49:07.269]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:49:07.289 --> 00:49:08.749]  Kurt Nemo's got the story up.
[00:49:08.789 --> 00:49:13.950]  Baldwin, Paul, and Barr sent a letter in opposition to MIAC report to Missouri officials.
[00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:15.131]  Good job Kurt Nemo on that.
[00:49:15.151 --> 00:49:16.251]  We'll have a letter up there soon.
[00:49:17.091 --> 00:49:21.174]  But we need to add in here that they're considering suing.
[00:49:21.254 --> 00:49:22.295]  That needs to be in the headline.
[00:49:22.335 --> 00:49:28.659]  You know, they're considering litigation if lies not retracted or demonization not retracted.
[00:49:29.139 --> 00:49:40.266]  Something like, Paul, you know, Ron Paul, Bob Barr, Baldwin, write letter to Mayak, report demonizing, you know, their supporters.
[00:49:40.727 --> 00:49:42.088]  And it needs to be in the first line.
[00:49:43.314 --> 00:49:45.356]  I'm doing editing even here on the air, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:45.396 --> 00:49:45.957]  It's insane.
[00:49:46.097 --> 00:49:49.621]  We're joined for the rest of the hour, and I apologize for getting him on light, but we decided to have a state police officer on.
[00:49:49.641 --> 00:49:51.142]  But it's a perfect segue into this.
[00:49:51.723 --> 00:49:53.785]  Stuart Rhodes created a great website.
[00:49:54.025 --> 00:49:55.027]  He's a constitutional lawyer.
[00:49:55.747 --> 00:50:03.255]  But masses of military and police have been saying they pledge to be oath keepers and not violate the Bill of Rights Constitution and to follow their oath.
[00:50:04.336 --> 00:50:11.001]  Uh, and it's, it's, when I read it, I said, this person has a deep knowledge of what's going on, because this is how I would have written it, probably better than I would have written it.
[00:50:11.522 --> 00:50:13.723]  So, uh, Stuart Rhodes, thanks for coming on, sir.
[00:50:14.444 --> 00:50:15.745]  Oh, you're welcome, and you're absolutely right.
[00:50:15.765 --> 00:50:17.406]  That was a fantastic segue.
[00:50:17.526 --> 00:50:19.908]  That officer is an oath keeper.
[00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:26.031]  And that's exactly what we are here to do, is to bring more men like that out.
[00:50:26.631 --> 00:50:32.793]  And most of the members of our organization don't use their real names, or we don't even want to know who they are.
[00:50:33.213 --> 00:50:39.936]  Because just like that gentleman there just did, we want them to be able to continue in their job and continue doing the good work for the American people.
[00:50:40.816 --> 00:50:50.902]  But because the federal government is so out of control and criminal, I mean, that's a sad testament that these officers don't even really have their own First Amendment to say they don't appreciate the country being destroyed.
[00:50:50.922 --> 00:50:56.065]  That's right, and standing up and saying you might actually obey the Constitution, because yes you can.
[00:50:56.736 --> 00:50:58.216]  So that's the world we live in right now.
[00:50:58.617 --> 00:51:00.437]  But you've probably been to our site.
[00:51:00.497 --> 00:51:03.498]  You can see the float of testimonials we have in from veterans.
[00:51:03.678 --> 00:51:09.500]  Most of the veterans are not afraid to put their name on it because they're no longer within reach of being punished for it.
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.661]  And they're standing up and saying, no, we're not going to do this.
[00:51:12.961 --> 00:51:21.063]  And the veterans are very important because the veterans are there to teach the young bucks how to behave, to show them what they're supposed to be doing.
[00:51:21.583 --> 00:51:23.824]  And so that's our mission, is to remind them of their oath.
[00:51:24.224 --> 00:51:24.664]  Absolutely.
[00:51:44.164 --> 00:51:45.788]  Just amazing testimonials on the site.
[00:51:45.828 --> 00:51:54.286]  What gave you the idea to create this and how many people have come on the site and pledged in just a few weeks it's been up that they're going to stand by the Constitution and Bill of Rights?
[00:51:55.097 --> 00:51:58.958]  Well, I was working for Congressman Paul's campaign here in Nevada.
[00:51:59.398 --> 00:52:00.359]  I used to work in his D.C.
[00:52:00.439 --> 00:52:02.740]  office, but I was so focused on the campaign.
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:05.961]  But about a year and a half ago, I had the idea that, you know, what do we do next?
[00:52:06.521 --> 00:52:09.342]  And if this campaign's not successful, what's our next move?
[00:52:09.982 --> 00:52:15.684]  And my thought was, well, let's have our focus of effort be on the men with the guns.
[00:52:16.204 --> 00:52:22.226]  If you're going to have an awakening of one million people, if you're going to have a chance to awaken one million people,
[00:52:22.816 --> 00:52:22.976]  to be
[00:52:35.444 --> 00:52:39.087]  Yes, if tyranny is going to come, it's going to come in the form of a uniform.
[00:52:39.567 --> 00:52:41.448]  The Ron Perl Revolution has probably woken up.
[00:52:41.548 --> 00:52:45.371]  Even mainstream media says probably 20-30 million Americans identify now.
[00:52:45.431 --> 00:52:48.293]  Imagine if we focused on the police and military.
[00:52:48.553 --> 00:52:49.774]  Game over for the New World Order.
[00:52:49.794 --> 00:52:50.134]  Go ahead.
[00:52:50.254 --> 00:52:50.775]  Exactly.
[00:52:50.935 --> 00:52:51.495]  Precisely.
[00:52:51.776 --> 00:52:53.137]  It's like maneuver warfare theory.
[00:52:53.157 --> 00:52:56.199]  You go to the rear of the enemy, you go to the heart of their strength.
[00:52:56.459 --> 00:52:58.680]  It's kind of like in the Lord of the Rings, the Ring of Power.
[00:52:59.461 --> 00:53:02.183]  They think the Ring of Power is that these guys are going to do whatever they say.
[00:53:03.007 --> 00:53:04.489]  They think the oath is their ring of power.
[00:53:04.589 --> 00:53:05.249]  But it's not true.
[00:53:05.410 --> 00:53:08.713]  The oath is to the Constitution, and even more fundamentally, it's to the people.
[00:53:09.273 --> 00:53:13.698]  And so, we're gonna take that, right to Mount Doom, and toss it right, you know, right up their chute.
[00:53:14.619 --> 00:53:16.981]  Oh man, that analogy is just pure gold.
[00:53:17.021 --> 00:53:18.283]  You are something special.
[00:53:20.607 --> 00:53:21.508]  Let me tell you something.
[00:53:21.708 --> 00:53:24.711]  I write for SWAT Magazine and here's what actually got me thinking about this.
[00:53:24.831 --> 00:53:30.117]  About a year and a half ago, I wrote a column and in response to that column, we got a letter from a U.S.
[00:53:30.978 --> 00:53:31.418]  J.R.
[00:53:31.659 --> 00:53:33.000]  Ewell, Colonel, U.S.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:33.721]  Army, retired.
[00:53:34.181 --> 00:53:37.445]  And he said, the Constitution and our Bill of Rights are gravely endangered today.
[00:53:37.987 --> 00:53:43.148]  And this community of military and veterans and law enforcement is where they will be saved.
[00:53:43.348 --> 00:53:44.668]  They ought to be saved at all.
[00:53:45.148 --> 00:53:46.669]  And he had the same insight you did.
[00:53:46.849 --> 00:53:49.249]  Look, they can't do it without those guys.
[00:53:49.449 --> 00:53:49.929]  Game over.
[00:53:49.949 --> 00:53:51.789]  It'd be like the end of the movie V for Vendetta.
[00:53:52.209 --> 00:53:57.170]  The military stands down and there's nothing between the people and the vultures.
[00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:58.090]  Nothing.
[00:53:58.611 --> 00:53:59.511]  And that's what our goal is.
[00:54:00.031 --> 00:54:01.911]  Well, I mean, police are going to lose their houses.
[00:54:01.931 --> 00:54:02.511]  They already are.
[00:54:02.551 --> 00:54:04.412]  They're going to lose their future in this new world order.
[00:54:05.032 --> 00:54:06.592]  They're going to lose their Second Amendment.
[00:54:07.403 --> 00:54:10.164]  Yeah, and their children will be indentured servants for the rest of their lives.
[00:54:11.064 --> 00:54:11.524]  That's right.
[00:54:13.065 --> 00:54:14.925]  Yeah, the globalists have overplayed their hand.
[00:54:14.965 --> 00:54:23.688]  I keep telling listeners, the phony churches on government payroll, I told you this a decade ago, now it's declassified, are telling you to stand down.
[00:54:24.568 --> 00:54:26.389]  So, there's several rings of power.
[00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:27.969]  One is the police and the enforcers.
[00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:29.750]  The others is the churches.
[00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:30.770]  Gotta take those back.
[00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:31.951]  Stay there, sir.
[00:54:31.971 --> 00:54:35.652]  We're gonna tell folks how they can visit the Oath Keepers website when we come back.
[00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:42.293]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:54:43.234 --> 00:54:45.917]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:49.762 --> 00:54:55.224]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:54:55.264 --> 00:54:55.784]  and the world.
[00:54:56.044 --> 00:54:59.505]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:54:59.925 --> 00:55:06.147]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:55:06.407 --> 00:55:08.208]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:55:08.448 --> 00:55:16.390]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:21.095]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:55:21.375 --> 00:55:26.901]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:55:27.181 --> 00:55:29.183]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:55:29.363 --> 00:55:31.606]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[00:55:31.946 --> 00:55:32.747]  Free of charge.
[00:55:33.027 --> 00:55:33.347]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[00:55:33.367 --> 00:55:33.427]  1-800-453-2202.

[00:55:34.988 --> 00:55:35.508]  Factory direct.
[00:55:35.548 --> 00:55:37.109]  Wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.

[00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:40.852]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:55:55.303 --> 00:56:00.646]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:56:01.187 --> 00:56:07.370]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:56:07.671 --> 00:56:09.492]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:56:09.652 --> 00:56:12.033]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:56:12.113 --> 00:56:23.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:56:25.302 --> 00:56:26.563]  It's not about left or right.
[00:56:26.963 --> 00:56:28.364]  It's about a one world government.
[00:56:28.824 --> 00:56:35.168]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:56:35.729 --> 00:56:43.514]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:56:43.994 --> 00:56:45.135]  The Obama Deception.
[00:56:45.555 --> 00:56:46.736]  The people strike back.
[00:56:48.403 --> 00:56:52.026]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:56:52.106 --> 00:56:57.752]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:56:57.832 --> 00:57:01.895]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[00:57:02.175 --> 00:57:04.458]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[00:57:04.638 --> 00:57:10.543]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[00:57:10.703 --> 00:57:11.303]  We're good to go!
[00:57:39.878 --> 00:57:40.798]  GoldenFLAX.com or call 800-387-5516.
[00:57:40.818 --> 00:57:41.118]  That's 800-387-5516.
[00:57:41.178 --> 00:57:41.878]  Free shipping included.
[00:57:41.898 --> 00:57:43.379]  They railed against the crown, another ragtag band, declaring
[00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:07.304]  Independence.
[00:58:08.244 --> 00:58:10.826]  They laid their bodies down in a bloody war.
[00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:17.391]  For liberty, for their descendants.
[00:58:19.073 --> 00:58:20.934]  Look in the mirror, that's you, that's me.
[00:58:22.816 --> 00:58:24.757]  Thanks to the renegades, we're free today.
[00:58:26.538 --> 00:58:30.041]  Thanks to the renegades, we're free today.
[00:58:32.483 --> 00:58:34.364]  Thank God for the renegades!
[00:58:35.413 --> 00:58:44.237]  And the lives they lead, far ahead of their time.
[00:58:44.658 --> 00:58:49.160]  Without the Renegades, Lord knows where we'd be.
[00:58:52.101 --> 00:58:55.343]  When it comes to heroes, Renegades are mine.
[00:58:56.984 --> 00:59:04.648]  And going back to the Mordor analogy, you have the tower, the mountain of power, the all-seeing eye, with its armies moving across the world, but right here,
[00:59:06.201 --> 00:59:08.147]  And it's command base right here in Empire US.
[00:59:10.689 --> 00:59:14.130]  It is distracted looking, looking everywhere for the ring.
[00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:23.514]  That's what this MIAC report is, is they're counting on the police and military being Uruk-hai or orcs or black ships from the east.
[00:59:23.654 --> 00:59:39.501]  They're planning on them going along with this evil and being seduced by the dark side, by being played and manipulated and maneuvered into war with the American people as they destroy their own futures, as they burn their own beds, their own nest.
[00:59:40.785 --> 00:59:41.526]  It's going to fail.
[00:59:43.026 --> 00:59:43.967]  It is going to fail.
[00:59:43.987 --> 00:59:50.311]  You have to first believe that and know that and reach out to the police and military now so they understand and educate them.
[00:59:50.711 --> 00:59:55.915]  Waking up one police officer or one active duty military person is like waking up a thousand regular Americans.
[00:59:56.975 --> 01:00:02.419]  Now, we have to also understand that the key here is, is there's people like Stuart Rhodes over there with
[01:00:04.824 --> 01:00:12.807]  Oath-Keepers.blogspot.com Oath-Keepers.blogspot.com or just Google his name, Stuart Rhodes Oath Keepers and it'll come up for you.
[01:00:12.827 --> 01:00:15.327]  We've got it up on screen right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:16.088 --> 01:00:29.032]  The fact that there is Ron Paul and Alex Jones and Stuart Rhodes and Jesse Ventura and thousands of other prominent people fighting, not just millions waking up and fighting, they killed me and only makes my information grow that much faster.
[01:00:29.052 --> 01:00:30.472]  If I was the only guy doing this though, I'd be dead.
[01:00:31.072 --> 01:00:33.013]  If Stuart was the only guy doing this, they'd go set him up or something.
[01:00:34.212 --> 01:00:35.295]  But there's too many of us now.
[01:00:35.355 --> 01:00:36.739]  They can't target and intimidate.
[01:00:37.181 --> 01:00:38.986]  They had the Ron Paul girl in here last night.
[01:00:39.006 --> 01:00:39.487]  I didn't know that.
[01:00:39.547 --> 01:00:40.510]  She was on my show last time.
[01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:41.673]  They were waiting for her outside.
[01:00:44.124 --> 01:00:49.028]  You know, Amy Allen, with crowbars, stealing nothing, just putting her in the hospital, you know, breaking bones.
[01:00:50.108 --> 01:00:51.550]  That is the type of intimidation.
[01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:52.550]  I've been physically attacked.
[01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:54.812]  And they've told me, shut up or you're dead next time.
[01:00:54.832 --> 01:00:57.574]  But I fought back and fought them off, and they didn't like getting hurt real bad.
[01:00:57.634 --> 01:01:03.098]  I got hurt bad too, but they were, you know, they were surprised that I wasn't a sheep, and I actually went absolutely ape.
[01:01:03.418 --> 01:01:04.699]  Because I'm not a slave, folks.
[01:01:04.739 --> 01:01:06.300]  You attack me, I attack right back.
[01:01:06.721 --> 01:01:07.862]  Quite frankly, the time enjoyed it.
[01:01:08.482 --> 01:01:09.803]  You know, I mean, that's just how I am.
[01:01:10.603 --> 01:01:11.763]  That's living there, you know.
[01:01:12.143 --> 01:01:14.044]  You don't really live until four people are pounding on you.
[01:01:14.064 --> 01:01:15.505]  But sad for her, she's a little girl.
[01:01:15.545 --> 01:01:16.225]  They hurt her bad.
[01:01:17.125 --> 01:01:18.066]  But you can't let that scare you.
[01:01:18.086 --> 01:01:19.466]  You gotta say, oh, that means I'm hurting you.
[01:01:19.486 --> 01:01:21.727]  That means I'm getting close to the crack of doom.
[01:01:22.267 --> 01:01:23.188]  To dump this ring in.
[01:01:24.059 --> 01:01:26.320]  You have to dare great, ladies and gentlemen, and you can succeed.
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.100]  Okay, I'm going to shut up.
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:27.900]  I made those points.
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:33.281]  It's just that they're also trying to divide our movements, trying to demonize, trying to say, don't trust this leader, don't trust that leader.
[01:01:33.541 --> 01:01:34.281]  That's the operatives.
[01:01:34.301 --> 01:01:35.262]  That's what COINTELPRO does.
[01:01:35.422 --> 01:01:36.742]  This person's a Mason.
[01:01:37.262 --> 01:01:38.682]  That person's a Vatican assassin.
[01:01:38.702 --> 01:01:39.963]  This person works for Israel.
[01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:42.003]  It's the information that's key.
[01:01:42.143 --> 01:01:45.644]  Bill of Rights, Constitution, Liberty, Second Amendment, National Sovereignty.
[01:01:45.864 --> 01:01:46.904]  Cut the size of government.
[01:01:46.924 --> 01:01:47.825]  Kick them out of the states.
[01:01:49.065 --> 01:01:50.325]  You know it's free by its fruits.
[01:01:50.945 --> 01:01:53.246]  So the other attack is to divide us.
[01:01:55.114 --> 01:01:59.197]  Now, go ahead and comment on those points, Stuart Rhodes, and let's get into the Oath Keepers.
[01:02:00.018 --> 01:02:09.965]  You're absolutely right, and that's why Oath Keepers, we've always stressed that this was first contemplated and first planned before the election.
[01:02:10.306 --> 01:02:11.587]  We didn't care who got elected.
[01:02:11.607 --> 01:02:13.408]  It didn't make a difference who was going to be president.
[01:02:13.728 --> 01:02:18.152]  We saw the growth of executive power, and we're talking about active duty military and veterans.
[01:02:18.772 --> 01:02:21.494]  And these gentlemen don't care who's president.
[01:02:21.755 --> 01:02:24.417]  We're looking at the big picture, and we're also, we stay neutral on
[01:02:25.117 --> 01:02:26.038]  We're good to go.
[01:02:46.886 --> 01:02:48.167]  And so we're seeing an awakening.
[01:02:48.187 --> 01:02:50.049]  Like the officer said, it's a quickening.
[01:02:50.529 --> 01:02:51.570]  And it doesn't make a difference.
[01:02:52.291 --> 01:02:53.672]  Forget about left and right.
[01:02:53.692 --> 01:02:54.833]  Forget about that kind of stuff.
[01:02:54.853 --> 01:02:57.635]  Like you said before, it's about liberty or tyranny.
[01:02:57.675 --> 01:02:59.477]  That's the dividing line.
[01:02:59.897 --> 01:03:01.238]  And so we go back to the basics.
[01:03:01.258 --> 01:03:02.720]  We go back to the Declaration of Independence.
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:04.321]  We go back to the Bill of Rights.
[01:03:04.821 --> 01:03:06.063]  We go back to the Constitution.
[01:03:06.403 --> 01:03:07.624]  Those are our common bond.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:11.380]  Absolutely.
[01:03:11.481 --> 01:03:13.002]  And that's all we care about.
[01:03:13.022 --> 01:03:19.446]  And you swore an oath to defend the Constitution, and you swore an oath more fundamentally to defend the people of this country.
[01:03:19.766 --> 01:03:20.927]  And that's all we care about.
[01:03:20.947 --> 01:03:21.947]  That's what really matters.
[01:03:22.288 --> 01:03:25.570]  And their interest is with the American people, too.
[01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:26.370]  Of course.
[01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:26.971]  Well, you know what?
[01:03:27.011 --> 01:03:28.712]  They don't belong to the Mordor and the Potomac.
[01:03:28.752 --> 01:03:29.532]  They belong to us.
[01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:30.853]  They're our fathers.
[01:03:30.893 --> 01:03:31.654]  They're our sons.
[01:03:31.954 --> 01:03:32.875]  They're our sisters.
[01:03:33.135 --> 01:03:33.995]  They're our uncles.
[01:03:34.316 --> 01:03:34.936]  They are us.
[01:03:35.476 --> 01:03:36.457]  They don't belong to them.
[01:03:37.057 --> 01:03:37.698]  They belong to us.
[01:03:38.869 --> 01:03:39.409]  That's right.
[01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:40.169]  That's right.
[01:03:40.189 --> 01:03:41.730]  They don't belong to Mordor, do they?
[01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:42.930]  No, they don't.
[01:03:43.311 --> 01:03:43.931]  Yeah.
[01:03:44.171 --> 01:03:44.911]  We're taking them back.
[01:03:45.091 --> 01:03:46.612]  They belong to Midas Tarith!
[01:03:47.772 --> 01:03:52.173]  That's why they have to demonize people.
[01:03:52.193 --> 01:03:56.635]  That's why you saw HR 1955 with a bipartisan assault on the American people.
[01:03:56.975 --> 01:04:05.778]  First thing you do is you label someone the enemy, you make them the other, you dehumanize them, and then you turn the forces against them.
[01:04:06.494 --> 01:04:10.416]  And so, but we're fighting back, and I think your show is important in that.
[01:04:10.796 --> 01:04:13.517]  You know what I think woke the military and police up the biggest?
[01:04:14.197 --> 01:04:17.299]  And we've confirmed this with state police and military everywhere, and it's even been in the news.
[01:04:18.259 --> 01:04:25.382]  But we knew about it before it was, I mean, the point is before it was in the news, they're telling them that, you know, mainline Americans are about to start bombing police stations.
[01:04:25.402 --> 01:04:26.563]  We've got to do IED training.
[01:04:26.803 --> 01:04:28.443]  The Army's going to be on the streets of America.
[01:04:28.924 --> 01:04:31.605]  There'll be a new world order, but it's good, and those that are against it are bad.
[01:04:32.961 --> 01:04:43.408]  They're now seeing the whole apparatus that was supposedly to fight Al-Qaeda has now been swung around like a cannon and aimed at the American people, and the police and military are going, whoa!
[01:04:43.448 --> 01:04:44.328]  That's right.
[01:04:44.648 --> 01:04:53.033]  In fact, we just now put up on our site an article on how enemy combatant status was first proposed during the Clinton administration.
[01:04:53.133 --> 01:05:00.778]  Most folks don't realize that, but that idea of using tribunals for even American citizens was first proposed during the Clinton years.
[01:05:01.328 --> 01:05:03.030]  To be used against McVeigh and the militias.
[01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:12.279]  And what Clinton didn't do, Bush unfortunately put into full effect, and now Obama's got it, and it's very likely he'll turn around and apply it domestically.
[01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:14.341]  You know, to average gun owners.
[01:05:14.461 --> 01:05:16.243]  That's the big, that's what we think might be the next spark.
[01:05:16.673 --> 01:05:19.314]  You know, going back to the Mordor analogy, it's just too good.
[01:05:19.334 --> 01:05:30.477]  Remember when the keeper of the fortress goes insane and says, no, we're all dead, and starts pouring oil on himself, saying, we can't beat them, there's nothing we can do, and sets himself on fire?
[01:05:30.517 --> 01:05:32.158]  That's the spirit.
[01:05:32.618 --> 01:05:34.859]  More than just waking up police and military, it's...
[01:05:35.459 --> 01:05:37.200]  The change is an inside job.
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.362]  It's all of us have to decide.
[01:05:39.542 --> 01:05:40.482]  Victory is ours.
[01:05:41.063 --> 01:05:43.664]  And it's not just a spirit or an idea.
[01:05:43.744 --> 01:05:44.485]  It's the truth.
[01:05:44.585 --> 01:05:46.166]  We have incredible power.
[01:05:46.466 --> 01:05:53.671]  But we have to prepare ourselves, steel ourselves, as you said, like steel, to understand this work and just commit.
[01:05:53.711 --> 01:05:58.434]  And when you commit and aren't worried that they demonize you, set you up, kill you, whatever they're going to do, you just commit.
[01:05:58.494 --> 01:06:01.616]  It's like a million pound weight goes off of you and you're truly alive.
[01:06:02.316 --> 01:06:07.458]  And you're now in communion with the Founding Fathers and every other rebel against tyranny in history.
[01:06:08.398 --> 01:06:08.858]  That's right.
[01:06:08.878 --> 01:06:09.879]  We're all going to die anyway.
[01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:11.139]  No one gets out of here alive.
[01:06:11.459 --> 01:06:13.320]  So what counts is whether you leave your children free.
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:14.400]  That's all that matters.
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:15.861]  That's all that matters.
[01:06:16.001 --> 01:06:16.501]  That's really it.
[01:06:17.001 --> 01:06:20.923]  And to take back your analogy there, they want you to think it's hopeless.
[01:06:22.163 --> 01:06:26.345]  It's like you're staring into the... You're seeing only their propaganda.
[01:06:26.385 --> 01:06:27.465]  If all you do is
[01:06:28.004 --> 01:06:31.025]  Is look at what they want you to see, you'll think it's hopeless.
[01:06:31.045 --> 01:06:31.346]  That's right.
[01:06:31.366 --> 01:06:35.487]  He's staring into the crystal and it's only what, it's a TV set.
[01:06:35.507 --> 01:06:37.088]  It's only what Mordor wants him to see.
[01:06:37.188 --> 01:06:38.429]  That's exactly right.
[01:06:38.889 --> 01:06:41.490]  Like Claire Wolf said, break your TV.
[01:06:41.650 --> 01:06:45.512]  Break that stuff and get on the web and communicate with your fellow man.
[01:06:45.832 --> 01:06:47.873]  And here's the thing about Oath Keepers, it's positive.
[01:06:47.933 --> 01:06:49.493]  That's why people respond to it so much.
[01:06:49.854 --> 01:06:50.714]  It's positive.
[01:06:50.774 --> 01:06:52.175]  It's not just more negativity.
[01:06:52.535 --> 01:06:55.256]  They're starting to see the other side of the look.
[01:06:55.476 --> 01:06:57.117]  Like you said, we have the strength.
[01:06:58.098 --> 01:06:59.058]  And we have the power.
[01:06:59.238 --> 01:07:01.699]  And you can't just assume the military is your enemy.
[01:07:01.719 --> 01:07:03.719]  You can't just assume police are your enemy.
[01:07:04.019 --> 01:07:06.800]  They want you to think that.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.840]  I have fallen into that.
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:11.041]  I mean, over the years, I've also got to reach out to them when I see the outrage.
[01:07:11.101 --> 01:07:16.142]  I started wondering about five years ago, why does the media show the worst police brutality over and over again?
[01:07:16.202 --> 01:07:17.482]  Why do they focus on it so much?
[01:07:17.502 --> 01:07:23.983]  And then I realized they want to split us apart, which puts the police more in their gang mentality and the people more in their mentality.
[01:07:24.363 --> 01:07:25.804]  And that's why they're advertising.
[01:07:25.844 --> 01:07:27.204]  And I'm actually helping them
[01:07:27.964 --> 01:07:29.927]  When I make a big deal out of it.
[01:07:30.788 --> 01:07:32.129]  Well, you know, you've got to have the truth.
[01:07:32.149 --> 01:07:33.811]  Like Patrick Henry said, you've got to see the truth.
[01:07:33.872 --> 01:07:35.654]  No, no, no, exactly.
[01:07:35.694 --> 01:07:46.908]  We put the truth out, but we have to also add, understand they're encouraging officers to act like this, and understand they're not all like this, and if we fall in to just hating them and being threatened by them, that's what they want.
[01:07:47.625 --> 01:07:47.985]  That's right.
[01:07:48.605 --> 01:07:53.508]  And that's one of the values you have in a man like you just had on, where he tells you, look, not all officers are like this.
[01:07:53.548 --> 01:07:55.208]  And you'd be surprised.
[01:07:55.248 --> 01:07:58.150]  We have a testimonial up on our site by a police officer.
[01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:59.990]  I'm going to find it here while we're talking and I'll read it to you.
[01:08:00.371 --> 01:08:06.293]  But he just basically says, look, the majority of the guys in my force agree we won't do these things.
[01:08:06.633 --> 01:08:08.914]  And I'm hearing that from Marines, too.
[01:08:08.954 --> 01:08:11.095]  I got a Marine sergeant the other day I talked to on the phone.
[01:08:11.115 --> 01:08:14.977]  He's like, I talk to my guys about this stuff all the time, and I make sure they know their oath.
[01:08:15.478 --> 01:08:18.901]  A lot of the young guys, when they first get to his unit, they think that they're opposed to the President.
[01:08:19.381 --> 01:08:20.382]  And we have to set them straight.
[01:08:20.842 --> 01:08:23.424]  You know, but now more and more we're talking about this stuff.
[01:08:23.444 --> 01:08:26.046]  And that was going on, you know, before we founded Oath Keepers.
[01:08:26.086 --> 01:08:27.007]  It was going on already.
[01:08:27.567 --> 01:08:29.488]  So we're just kind of tapping into what's already happening.
[01:08:29.929 --> 01:08:30.789]  I'm looking for that right now.
[01:08:31.050 --> 01:08:31.430]  Here we go.
[01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:42.278]  This officer says he's a Texas police officer, because after serving in the Navy from 90 to 93 on board the USS Blue Ridge, I became a police officer and I'm still on the force.
[01:08:42.901 --> 01:08:48.428]  Not only will I refuse any unlawful order that violates the Constitution, I will fight the tyrants that give the orders.
[01:08:48.989 --> 01:08:53.215]  Rest assured that me and my brothers in law enforcement talk about this subject on a regular basis.
[01:08:53.756 --> 01:08:55.738]  About 80% feel the same way I do.
[01:08:56.419 --> 01:09:00.645]  I ask the rookies that when it comes down to nut-cutting, whose side will you be on?
[01:09:01.323 --> 01:09:05.447]  Founding fathers who made this country so great, or the tyrants that are in power now.
[01:09:05.868 --> 01:09:08.430]  I took the oath twice, and will uphold it two-fold.
[01:09:08.851 --> 01:09:12.134]  God bless America, and he signed his name, Colin Connerly.
[01:09:12.654 --> 01:09:16.278]  Some people are willing to put their names on it, other folks understandably are not.
[01:09:16.999 --> 01:09:18.620]  But that's the sentiment we're getting.
[01:09:18.881 --> 01:09:23.225]  We're getting flooded emails like that, saying, yeah, we're with you, you know?
[01:09:26.107 --> 01:09:39.856]  Well, I would add to this that, you know, getting into the spiritual angle of this, standing up for liberty and goodness, you know, as Martin Luther King said, the universe bends towards truth, towards justice, that it's providence.
[01:09:40.016 --> 01:09:52.244]  And if you don't understand that, folks, when you decide to fight evil and really get your head straight, and you really are fighting evil, not being manipulated into fighting some red herring the establishment gives you, they're very good at that, it's like an electrical connection.
[01:09:52.744 --> 01:09:53.365]  It's spiritual.
[01:09:53.865 --> 01:09:54.405]  We're good to go!
[01:10:25.426 --> 01:10:25.867]  That's right.
[01:10:26.287 --> 01:10:29.310]  The first thing you've got to do is not let fear control you.
[01:10:30.131 --> 01:10:35.756]  You've got to look at the big picture and realize that's the value of the oath.
[01:10:35.836 --> 01:10:37.798]  Everyone has taken that oath in the military.
[01:10:39.019 --> 01:10:40.320]  They did so understandingly.
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:41.161]  It could mean their life.
[01:10:42.162 --> 01:10:44.504]  These men, they take it so seriously still.
[01:10:45.379 --> 01:10:54.763]  I've gotten letters, I can't even read them, I'll start bawling, but letters from Vietnam veterans and Korean War veterans, and they still take that Osterius to this day.
[01:10:55.523 --> 01:11:05.107]  And they understand that they have a line going all the way back to the men of April 19, 1775, even before that.
[01:11:06.028 --> 01:11:11.450]  They understand that the line of men who have fought and bled and died for freedom,
[01:11:12.771 --> 01:11:15.372]  And they understand that all those men gave him a sacred trust.
[01:11:16.192 --> 01:11:18.033]  And now it's their watch.
[01:11:18.413 --> 01:11:21.114]  That's why our motto is, it's not on our watch.
[01:11:21.514 --> 01:11:26.576]  Because now it's our turn to make sure that the light of liberty does not go out.
[01:11:26.596 --> 01:11:31.918]  Because if America falls, the world will fall into an age of darkness.
[01:11:32.519 --> 01:11:33.239]  And that's the truth.
[01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:35.009]  And these guys, they know it.
[01:11:35.229 --> 01:11:36.030]  They're waking up.
[01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:37.170]  Look at North Korea.
[01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:38.350]  Look at China.
[01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:39.150]  Look at Mexico.
[01:11:39.190 --> 01:11:44.452]  They're all falling into total corruption and mass murder and open sewage running down the streets.
[01:11:44.792 --> 01:11:45.872]  That's what evil does.
[01:11:47.693 --> 01:11:52.554]  Very few nations in history, and we haven't been perfect here in the U.S., but compared to others, it's been amazing.
[01:11:53.234 --> 01:11:56.775]  Four percent of the world's population, half the world's wealth, until the bankers took over.
[01:11:56.815 --> 01:11:57.695]  Now they're taking it from us.
[01:11:58.096 --> 01:11:59.136]  And that was produced here.
[01:11:59.856 --> 01:12:01.557]  And again, that's what a little bit of liberty.
[01:12:01.577 --> 01:12:03.858]  We haven't been perfect, but it's a lot compared to other countries.
[01:12:05.899 --> 01:12:08.560]  The jewel of liberty, as Thomas Jefferson said, must be guarded.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.460]  It is the engine of everything good.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.201]  That's it.
[01:12:12.241 --> 01:12:13.201]  I mean, that's it.
[01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:14.202]  Freedom is all that matters.
[01:12:14.682 --> 01:12:19.204]  And as Franklin said, those who would give up freedom for perceived security will have neither.
[01:12:19.804 --> 01:12:20.965]  And so you can't give up freedom.
[01:12:21.565 --> 01:12:24.126]  It's the fundamental, like you just said, it's the engine of all that's good.
[01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:28.877]  And so the secret is not to let fear control you.
[01:12:29.077 --> 01:12:36.209]  And since 9-11, people have been so afraid, they've allowed all the infrastructure of the totalitarian state to be put in place.
[01:12:37.051 --> 01:12:37.632]  And as you know.
[01:12:38.197 --> 01:12:40.578]  And so now what we have to do is we have to stop it.
[01:12:40.598 --> 01:12:44.039]  And you don't stop it in the courts, and apparently you don't stop it in Congress either.
[01:12:44.059 --> 01:12:45.419]  They'll go ahead and do whatever they want anyway.
[01:12:45.799 --> 01:12:50.101]  What you do is you stop it at the base level of the people just saying no.
[01:12:50.361 --> 01:12:51.241]  Here's an example.
[01:12:51.361 --> 01:13:01.244]  I was on 93.7 FM for an hourish day downtown during South by Southwest, and I walked by three police, and they were all fans of the show and wanted to shake my hand.
[01:13:03.044 --> 01:13:05.425]  So, you know, that's an example.
[01:13:05.525 --> 01:13:11.347]  Even after all of my, you know, ranting and raving, you know, they told me, hey, we don't like what's happening either.
[01:13:11.967 --> 01:13:15.449]  And we don't like how the media just totally focuses on the bad cops.
[01:13:16.109 --> 01:13:19.050]  And so I can see I was, I've also been fooled by that spell.
[01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:23.412]  You know, as I get older, I learn more and more how this sophisticated mind control system works.
[01:13:24.012 --> 01:13:25.912]  All of us, you know, are waking up together.
[01:13:26.313 --> 01:13:27.093]  And I agree.
[01:13:27.133 --> 01:13:28.633]  I mean, when I sit on there, I feel a quickening.
[01:13:28.693 --> 01:13:29.354]  I see a quickening.
[01:13:30.254 --> 01:13:34.357]  It's like I just, you know, jumped off a 300 foot cliff into cold icy water.
[01:13:34.497 --> 01:13:37.119]  I mean, it's invigorating, it's bracing, it's like, whoa!
[01:13:37.439 --> 01:13:45.686]  And then to realize that myself and others are at the very center of a crossroads that is the future destiny of humanity.
[01:13:47.167 --> 01:13:50.309]  When people look back on this time, it's going to dwarf the importance of 1776, I believe.
[01:13:52.429 --> 01:13:53.669]  It might well, it might well.
[01:13:53.890 --> 01:13:56.170]  And that's the key, is to break the spell.
[01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:59.792]  You know, they've been under a spell, and we've been under a spell, and it's time to break it.
[01:14:00.212 --> 01:14:00.732]  Absolutely.
[01:14:01.892 --> 01:14:06.394]  And so what we did is we issued a declaration of 10 orders we will not obey.
[01:14:06.954 --> 01:14:09.935]  And that's what's kind of causing a lot of controversy and firestorm.
[01:14:10.495 --> 01:14:16.717]  And when I go around the web and look at different forums that are discussing it, it's what's happening is exactly what we wanted to happen.
[01:14:16.817 --> 01:14:21.859]  We wanted veterans and current serving military to have discussions about where their line is.
[01:14:22.566 --> 01:14:26.488]  Each person has their own... I mean, every service member has an obligation.
[01:14:27.048 --> 01:14:32.291]  Not just that they can refuse a legal order or an lawful order, they have an obligation to.
[01:14:33.492 --> 01:14:34.092]  They have to.
[01:14:34.713 --> 01:14:37.414]  And so they have to make a decision for themselves where that line is.
[01:14:37.654 --> 01:14:40.956]  And so, as the author said a minute ago, you have to do it ahead of time.
[01:14:41.016 --> 01:14:42.757]  So that's our declaration of 10 orders.
[01:14:43.317 --> 01:14:48.640]  We carefully cracked these to tie into American history, because history is repeating itself.
[01:14:49.409 --> 01:14:56.292]  Much of the causes of the revolution are happening again, and also the history of the 20th century, with the death camps and mass internment.
[01:14:56.852 --> 01:14:58.073]  And what we see happening today.
[01:14:58.673 --> 01:14:59.513]  It all flows together.
[01:15:00.654 --> 01:15:02.214]  So do you want to go down to the ten orders?
[01:15:02.594 --> 01:15:07.236]  Yeah, let's do that in the next segment, and if you can stay five minutes to the next hour, then our next guest is coming on.
[01:15:07.276 --> 01:15:08.577]  I want to invite you back routinely.
[01:15:08.597 --> 01:15:12.619]  I know you're a busy guy, but you need to talk to Ted Anderson, maybe at a Genesis radio show or something.
[01:15:12.639 --> 01:15:15.640]  You're very, very eloquent, and when we come back, we'll go over the ten points, but what I like
[01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:22.064]  Is that, you know, that huge rumble revolution, at first people were like, oh, it went nowhere, and I said, no.
[01:15:22.464 --> 01:15:26.927]  It's a delayed explosion, like in Force 10 Navarone, when they bomb the dam, and they're like, where is it?
[01:15:26.947 --> 01:15:30.049]  And he just said, just, just sitting there smoking a pipe, just wait a moment.
[01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:33.592]  Uh, you know, that's how, and then suddenly it starts breaking, boom!
[01:15:33.952 --> 01:15:42.218]  And, and, and now we're seeing that, and people realize they can defeat the enemy in the Info War, and now they're just blasting, they're picking up arms in the revolution of the mind.
[01:15:42.518 --> 01:15:43.739]  People are taking the red pills.
[01:15:44.059 --> 01:15:49.101]  They're waking up, and I'm seeing people like you from the Ron Paul campaign and others disperse out and start your own operations.
[01:15:49.141 --> 01:15:56.324]  Yourfoodstorage.com has been helping families prepare with the lowest-priced, highest-quality, storable food for over a decade.
[01:15:56.464 --> 01:16:00.666]  And right now, a one-year food supply that feeds four to five people is only $39.95.
[01:16:00.926 --> 01:16:02.487]  That's right.
[01:16:02.707 --> 01:16:05.708]  A one-year supply that feeds four to five people for under $4,000.
[01:16:09.582 --> 01:16:10.103]  We're good to go.
[01:16:27.602 --> 01:16:29.043]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:16:52.512 --> 01:16:54.637]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:16:55.118 --> 01:17:02.154]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:17:02.711 --> 01:17:08.914]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:17:09.294 --> 01:17:11.115]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:17:11.275 --> 01:17:13.697]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:17:13.777 --> 01:17:24.722]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:17:25.342 --> 01:17:26.643]  It's not about left or right.
[01:17:27.023 --> 01:17:28.384]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:17:28.883 --> 01:17:35.208]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:17:44.054 --> 01:17:45.195]  The Obama Deception.
[01:17:45.615 --> 01:17:46.796]  The people strike back.
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:52.063]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:17:52.244 --> 01:17:56.328]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:17:56.488 --> 01:18:04.456]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[01:18:04.736 --> 01:18:07.917]  Without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:18:08.137 --> 01:18:14.019]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:18:14.279 --> 01:18:18.660]  And germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:26.942]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[01:18:27.142 --> 01:18:33.984]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of healthcare and
[01:18:37.005 --> 01:18:37.826]  Riders on the storm.
[01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:38.846]  Riders on the storm.
[01:18:38.966 --> 01:18:39.807]  Riders on the storm.
[01:18:39.827 --> 01:18:40.708]  Riders on the storm.
[01:18:40.928 --> 01:18:41.928]  Riders on the storm.
[01:18:41.948 --> 01:18:43.349]  Riders on the storm.
[01:18:43.369 --> 01:18:43.810]  Riders on the storm.
[01:19:07.269 --> 01:19:10.431]  Get involved in the Info War today.
[01:19:12.593 --> 01:19:14.915]  Enlist in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Liberty.
[01:19:15.995 --> 01:19:16.876]  Targets of Opportunity.
[01:19:16.916 --> 01:19:17.857]  Wake up those in your area.
[01:19:18.057 --> 01:19:21.039]  Get the Obama Deception on DVD.
[01:19:21.479 --> 01:19:22.700]  It's super high quality.

[01:19:25.182 --> 01:19:25.602]  Get it out.

[01:19:32.707 --> 01:19:33.928]  Let your children play.
[01:19:37.694 --> 01:19:39.316]  You give this man a ride, folks.
[01:19:44.461 --> 01:19:45.863]  Don't give this man a ride.
[01:19:46.003 --> 01:19:49.907]  Barack Obama, the front man of the New World Order, the tip of the spear in their war against humanity.
[01:19:50.487 --> 01:19:51.168]  Wake up to them.
[01:19:51.749 --> 01:19:53.431]  Realize the true depths of their wickedness.
[01:19:54.892 --> 01:19:56.573]  They're attacking on every basic liberty.
[01:19:56.613 --> 01:19:57.293]  It's over the top.
[01:19:57.853 --> 01:20:16.781]  I'm sure you heard, sir, Stuart Rhodes with Oath Keepers, oath-keepers.blogspot.com, that the House has passed the forced conscription of the American people bill, and I happen to have the army code that the Pentagon has issued saying it will be forced military service.
[01:20:16.821 --> 01:20:18.261]  I mean, the hour is late.
[01:20:19.442 --> 01:20:21.062]  It is, but that's okay.
[01:20:21.102 --> 01:20:22.243]  It's darkest before the dawn.
[01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:26.227]  And so I think it's pretty clear that we're going to stand tall.
[01:20:26.267 --> 01:20:28.609]  That's why we bumped up our program.
[01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:32.512]  We were going to do a regular site, but we saw that things were happening.
[01:20:32.732 --> 01:20:38.837]  In fact, I called Colonel Hapgood, also of the Iowa National Guard, and he lied to me like he lied to you.
[01:20:39.618 --> 01:20:45.282]  They have a dedicated mouth facility 80 miles north of that town they're going to do exercise in, and he just flat lied to us.
[01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:49.686]  And so that's one thing that got us hopping mad and decided to put it up on Blogspot first.
[01:20:50.602 --> 01:20:58.987]  One thing I do want to say, I want to let folks know that I write for Swat Magazine, and I want to make it clear that that's a magazine that's, you know, most people think it's just for law enforcement.
[01:20:59.007 --> 01:20:59.427]  It's not.
[01:20:59.847 --> 01:21:05.050]  And the gentlemen who run that magazine are dedicated patriots, and they're going to give both keepers free ad space.
[01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:09.312]  So I encourage folks to check out Swat Magazine, run by true patriots.
[01:21:10.393 --> 01:21:11.313]  So that's my plug for them.
[01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:13.694]  No, yeah, give out the website.
[01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:14.915]  No, that's good.
[01:21:14.975 --> 01:21:16.756]  We have to take the high ground here.
[01:21:17.403 --> 01:21:17.843]  That's right.
[01:21:17.883 --> 01:21:18.924]  Yeah, you betcha.
[01:21:19.044 --> 01:21:21.866]  And their mission has always been, that's why they asked me to write that column.
[01:21:21.906 --> 01:21:23.067]  They used to have Claire Wolfe write it.
[01:21:23.367 --> 01:21:24.588]  You know who Claire Wolfe is, correct?
[01:21:24.808 --> 01:21:25.068]  Yes.
[01:21:25.729 --> 01:21:25.949]  Right.
[01:21:26.049 --> 01:21:30.292]  She used to write the Enemy at the Gate column, and then she asked me to take it over when she got gunned and burned out.
[01:21:30.612 --> 01:21:34.155]  But their mission is to make sure that there's the separation between law enforcement
[01:21:34.948 --> 01:21:36.268]  And the people is broken down.
[01:21:36.288 --> 01:21:38.009]  They don't believe there should be that separation.
[01:21:38.409 --> 01:21:47.372]  And so Rich Lucibel, the man that owns SWAT, has stood up and dedicated that entire column every month to the mission of defending the Bill of Rights.
[01:21:47.712 --> 01:21:52.733]  Well, we knew this would come when the New World Order emerged and admitted everything we've been warning people about.
[01:21:52.753 --> 01:21:59.295]  That's why I said, even if we get laughed at, tell people the documents, tell them the truth, because when they finally emerge, when they make their big move, which is now happening,
[01:22:00.455 --> 01:22:10.118]  Then people would have been warned and then they would wake up, but also as the police and military are being twisted in their mission now to carry out globalism, that would be the big wake-up call there.
[01:22:10.218 --> 01:22:17.481]  I think the enemy trying to program them right now is waking police and military up faster than even the patriots.
[01:22:18.436 --> 01:22:18.776]  Absolutely.
[01:22:18.836 --> 01:22:26.300]  And of course, Obama is acting like a complete fool with what he did with the veterans and forced them to pay for their own medical care.
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.800]  It's just a huge blunder.
[01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:28.861]  It just shows the arrogance.
[01:22:29.241 --> 01:22:30.021]  The hubris.
[01:22:30.742 --> 01:22:32.923]  Oh yeah, and so the anger and outrage.
[01:22:32.943 --> 01:22:33.623]  They're blind.
[01:22:33.723 --> 01:22:35.524]  They can't see certain things.
[01:22:35.544 --> 01:22:37.025]  They're almost autistic in some way.
[01:22:37.125 --> 01:22:38.625]  Alright, we're about to break.
[01:22:38.686 --> 01:22:39.446]  We only have like five.
[01:22:39.466 --> 01:22:40.867]  Yeah, they're delusional.
[01:22:41.947 --> 01:22:43.628]  We're about to break, but start with the ten points.
[01:22:44.497 --> 01:22:44.837]  We betcha.
[01:22:45.077 --> 01:22:55.863]  Well, the ten points are just what we think are the most likely hot points and tripwires, and what we think officers should be considering, and soldiers, as the lines in the sand they will not cross.
[01:22:55.923 --> 01:23:00.826]  Number one is, we will not obey any order to disarm the American people.
[01:23:01.186 --> 01:23:04.828]  And I was like, you know that was the cause of the first American Revolution, and that was the final spark.
[01:23:06.829 --> 01:23:08.670]  Lexington and Concord continue, number two.
[01:23:09.312 --> 01:23:12.294]  Number two, we will not obey orders to conduct warrantless searches of the American people.
[01:23:12.574 --> 01:23:13.935]  And there again, the risk of assistance.
[01:23:13.955 --> 01:23:16.777]  Warrantless searches were one of the causes of the American Revolution.
[01:23:17.517 --> 01:23:23.941]  And number three is we will not obey orders to detain American citizens as unlawful enemy combatants or to subject them to the military tribunal.
[01:23:24.342 --> 01:23:26.363]  Stay there, we've got to come back in 70 seconds.
[01:23:27.764 --> 01:23:34.668]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:23:34.688 --> 01:23:36.930]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:23:38.766 --> 01:23:40.327]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:23:40.447 --> 01:23:45.088]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:23:45.188 --> 01:23:47.949]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:23:48.150 --> 01:23:51.011]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:23:51.191 --> 01:23:57.033]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:23:57.273 --> 01:24:00.235]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:24:00.496 --> 01:24:07.401]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:10.624]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:24:10.784 --> 01:24:10.984]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:24:11.044 --> 01:24:12.325]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[01:24:15.928 --> 01:24:21.992]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:24:22.172 --> 01:24:25.934]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:24:25.974 --> 01:24:27.275]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:24:27.295 --> 01:24:27.895]  Take action today.
[01:24:27.935 --> 01:24:29.916]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:24:41.511 --> 01:24:43.412]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:24:43.892 --> 01:24:46.833]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:50.095 --> 01:24:53.016]  He has spurred so many thoughts in my instincts.
[01:25:02.489 --> 01:25:05.710]  You know, who our ancestors were, everything that I've added quite a bit today.
[01:25:05.730 --> 01:25:11.711]  I want to have you back up in the next few weeks for a full hour to talk more about Oath Keepers and take your phone calls.
[01:25:12.091 --> 01:25:13.711]  He's an amazing individual, Stuart Rhodes.
[01:25:14.211 --> 01:25:17.812]  There's so many great people that, you know, are out there prominently fighting the globalists.
[01:25:17.832 --> 01:25:18.412]  We just commend them.
[01:25:18.712 --> 01:25:21.632]  Run through the other eight points in the five minutes we have left, sir.
[01:25:22.232 --> 01:25:23.253]  You betcha.
[01:25:23.373 --> 01:25:30.434]  The other ones are, we will not obey orders to impose martial law on a state or state emergency on a state.
[01:25:32.133 --> 01:25:36.517]  Five is we will not obey orders to invade, subjugate any state that asserts its sovereignty.
[01:25:36.757 --> 01:25:45.424]  That's kind of a reflection on the initiatives that have come out recently where states are standing up and saying, we're going to interpose ourselves between the federal government and our own people.
[01:25:45.584 --> 01:25:52.370]  And that was an issue back in the 1770s because they would remove governors or legislatures and put in puppets, but go ahead.
[01:25:53.111 --> 01:25:53.551]  Exactly.
[01:25:53.651 --> 01:25:56.814]  And number six is we will not obey any order to blockade American cities.
[01:25:57.216 --> 01:25:59.398]  Well, that's turning them into giant concentration camps.
[01:25:59.798 --> 01:26:02.480]  And that was first done in Boston at the time of the American Revolution.
[01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:14.009]  Like you just said, Boston was put under military dictatorship with General Gage, and then when the fighting started, the people of Boston were told, if you turn in your guns, we'll give you a safe passage out of the city.
[01:26:14.389 --> 01:26:17.011]  And they turned their guns in, and then they were told they could not leave.
[01:26:17.412 --> 01:26:19.954]  And they were kept there, and then it was turned into a concentration camp.
[01:26:20.714 --> 01:26:25.298]  Until the militia showed up and kicked the British out of Boston.
[01:26:25.922 --> 01:26:31.606]  So number seven is we will not obey any order to force American citizens into any form of detention camps under any pretext.
[01:26:32.127 --> 01:26:39.052]  And we fight the history, an unfortunate history, of the Japanese internment here at home, but also the history around the world of oppressive governments.
[01:26:39.072 --> 01:26:41.694]  When they make war on their own people, they put them into camps.
[01:26:41.754 --> 01:26:49.420]  In part, that's done to put women and children into camps so that the men who are fighting will turn themselves in on behalf of their children.
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:55.563]  And the schools, public schools, admit they've been drilling to grab kids without asking on FEMA buses and then tell parents to report.
[01:26:55.823 --> 01:26:57.904]  So tyranny does the same thing over and over again.
[01:26:57.944 --> 01:26:58.345]  Continue.
[01:26:58.545 --> 01:26:58.925]  That's right.
[01:26:59.145 --> 01:27:03.547]  Number eight, we will not obey orders to assist or support the use of any foreign troops on U.S.
[01:27:03.567 --> 01:27:06.909]  soil against the American people to keep the peace or to maintain control.
[01:27:07.690 --> 01:27:13.893]  And as you know, we've been hearing rumors of this for decades, but we're now hearing the same rumors once again.
[01:27:14.551 --> 01:27:17.895]  No, no, no.
[01:27:17.915 --> 01:27:22.701]  The agreements have been signed.
[01:27:22.721 --> 01:27:26.506]  Toronto Star, Canadian-Mexican trips to be used, I-4 trips to be used.
[01:27:26.526 --> 01:27:27.427]  Those are not rumors.
[01:27:27.867 --> 01:27:29.689]  I have hundreds of mainstream articles if you'd like them.
[01:27:29.709 --> 01:27:30.931]  No, no, no.
[01:27:30.971 --> 01:27:31.171]  Go ahead.
[01:27:34.471 --> 01:27:35.232]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[01:27:35.572 --> 01:27:46.046]  No, no, it's just that... No, I mean, I've had Colonel Craig Roberts and others on who have had, like, their nephews at West Point and they, you know, they send in famous generals to tell them we're gonna use foreign troops, but it's a good thing.
[01:27:46.286 --> 01:27:47.407]  So, no, that is going on.
[01:27:47.608 --> 01:27:48.188]  That's not a rumor.
[01:27:48.888 --> 01:27:49.428]  Oh, I know.
[01:27:49.508 --> 01:27:51.549]  I just like to hit my bets with people.
[01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:53.591]  Well, no, I mean, it's true they're planning it.
[01:27:53.811 --> 01:27:55.091]  The rumor is they may bring them in.
[01:27:55.131 --> 01:27:55.752]  I see what you're saying.
[01:27:55.772 --> 01:27:56.072]  Go ahead.
[01:27:56.212 --> 01:27:56.452]  Right.
[01:27:56.632 --> 01:27:57.033]  Exactly.
[01:27:57.493 --> 01:28:02.656]  We will not obey any orders to confiscate the property of the American people, including food and other essential supplies.
[01:28:02.716 --> 01:28:03.396]  That's number nine.
[01:28:03.556 --> 01:28:05.157]  That's in the public executive orders.
[01:28:05.177 --> 01:28:05.857]  They're planning that.
[01:28:06.158 --> 01:28:07.138]  So that's public.
[01:28:08.139 --> 01:28:08.319]  Yep.
[01:28:08.739 --> 01:28:15.263]  We will not obey any orders which infringe on the right of the people to free speech, peaceably assemble, and petition their government for redisagreement.
[01:28:15.303 --> 01:28:16.343]  I mean, all these are basic.
[01:28:16.503 --> 01:28:17.724]  They should be common sense.
[01:28:18.311 --> 01:28:24.580]  No brainers, but unfortunately, as you know, you have to remind people of the basics sometimes.
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:28.266]  We can't take it for granted that someone's going to be thinking about this stuff ahead of time.
[01:28:28.306 --> 01:28:28.907]  Look at Katrina.
[01:28:29.491 --> 01:28:36.955]  You know, we're hearing now that a lot of that was caught because those guard troops and those officers hadn't thought about it ahead of time.
[01:28:36.995 --> 01:28:40.157]  They're kind of like caught flat-footed when they were told to go do these things.
[01:28:40.197 --> 01:28:41.858]  And so we want them to think about it in advance.
[01:28:42.339 --> 01:28:44.220]  And we don't think it's going to go down the same way again.
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:44.740]  That's right.
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:47.141]  Iowa was a gun confiscation drill, that's admitted.
[01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:54.706]  And then they sent out 22 MPs and a colonel to the Alabama shooting and now they're looking at charges of posse comandatis violation.
[01:28:55.438 --> 01:28:55.838]  That's right.
[01:28:55.898 --> 01:28:56.899]  That's a good sign.
[01:28:56.919 --> 01:29:06.087]  It's a good sign that within the military there's still people who understand the necessary wall of separation between civil and military power and take it serious.
[01:29:06.268 --> 01:29:08.029]  So we're very confident.
[01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:09.350]  We feel very good about this.
[01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:15.556]  One thing I do want to ask your listeners to do, we are going to be doing a tribute video to men who served.
[01:29:17.657 --> 01:29:20.400]  And so we'd like to have them send us in photos.
[01:29:21.912 --> 01:29:30.934]  Of those who served when they were young, all the old photos of them and their buddies, and who they were and where they served, email them to us and we'll put them in our tribute video.
[01:29:32.254 --> 01:29:33.034]  Absolutely.
[01:29:33.374 --> 01:29:33.654]  Stay there.
[01:29:33.674 --> 01:29:40.816]  I want to say one last point when we get back of how the enemy's going to attack your key operation, then we've got our next guest on the line, get our next guest up.
[01:29:40.836 --> 01:29:43.456]  Stay there for two more minutes on the other side, we'll get to our next guest.
[01:29:43.756 --> 01:29:44.176]  Stay with us.
[01:29:44.216 --> 01:29:46.077]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com!
[01:29:49.272 --> 01:29:52.655]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:52.795 --> 01:29:58.020]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:02.984]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:30:03.365 --> 01:30:14.475]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:30:14.855 --> 01:30:20.416]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:20.636 --> 01:30:26.697]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:26.897 --> 01:30:27.558]  What about you?
[01:30:27.938 --> 01:30:33.979]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99, with free shipping.

[01:30:39.881 --> 01:30:41.202]  That's 1-877-886-3653.

[01:30:49.086 --> 01:30:54.409]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:30:54.909 --> 01:31:01.933]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:02.469 --> 01:31:08.671]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:09.071 --> 01:31:10.892]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:11.032 --> 01:31:13.452]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:13.533 --> 01:31:24.436]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:31:25.114 --> 01:31:26.395]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:26.775 --> 01:31:28.176]  It's about a one world government.
[01:31:28.636 --> 01:31:34.939]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:43.344]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:43.804 --> 01:31:44.965]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:45.385 --> 01:31:46.586]  The people strike back.
[01:31:48.303 --> 01:31:49.804]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:31:50.004 --> 01:31:51.446]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:31:51.746 --> 01:31:53.967]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:31:54.428 --> 01:31:59.172]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:31:59.572 --> 01:32:02.394]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:32:02.754 --> 01:32:06.217]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[01:32:06.641 --> 01:32:18.650]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[01:32:19.210 --> 01:32:21.192]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[01:32:21.212 --> 01:32:22.513]  I use one every day.
[01:32:22.933 --> 01:32:25.375]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:32:25.755 --> 01:32:26.195]  Big Brother.
[01:32:55.097 --> 01:32:56.139]  Mainstream media.
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:57.981]  Government cover-ups.
[01:32:58.642 --> 01:32:59.443]  You want answers?
[01:33:00.204 --> 01:33:01.145]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:01.766 --> 01:33:05.491]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:05.972 --> 01:33:10.017]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:33:10.918 --> 01:33:12.299]  We are back live.
[01:33:12.359 --> 01:33:14.219]  We have 52 minutes left in transmission.
[01:33:14.259 --> 01:33:18.100]  In just a few minutes, we're going to go directly to our guest who apologized and rescheduled twice last week.
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:19.261]  So much has been happening.
[01:33:19.301 --> 01:33:20.381]  He's written an amazing book.
[01:33:20.401 --> 01:33:21.201]  I've already read most of it.
[01:33:21.241 --> 01:33:23.382]  It's somewhere in here in the office.
[01:33:23.402 --> 01:33:24.842]  Will somebody find me that New World Order book?
[01:33:25.122 --> 01:33:27.023]  Corporatism, the Secret Government, and the New World Order.
[01:33:27.523 --> 01:33:28.964]  Talk to this professor here in just a moment.
[01:33:29.344 --> 01:33:29.784]  Researcher.
[01:33:30.919 --> 01:33:36.280]  But finishing up with Stuart Rhodes of oath-keepers.blogspot.com.
[01:33:36.661 --> 01:33:39.681]  Let me tell everybody here how they're going to attack what you're doing.
[01:33:40.302 --> 01:33:41.622]  And it's with fear, again.
[01:33:43.262 --> 01:33:45.383]  Intimidation of police and military that speak out.
[01:33:45.423 --> 01:33:52.525]  But as more and more speak out, it's kind of like in those famous, you know, historical things where we have a church full of people in the Revolutionary War, and they'll say, who stands with us?
[01:33:52.945 --> 01:33:56.606]  It takes about a minute, and one guy steps forward, and then two step forward, and then everybody steps forward.
[01:33:57.046 --> 01:33:58.527]  Same thing with the Alamo in 1836.
[01:34:01.158 --> 01:34:05.260]  The enemy, and I bet if I Google this it's already out there, is going to say, don't sign up for this!
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:08.441]  It's Feds getting your name in the list and they're going to get you!
[01:34:09.921 --> 01:34:16.124]  You have to be, I've always said this, out in the open, resisting the New World Order, speaking out, involved.
[01:34:16.244 --> 01:34:18.205]  We are the majority, we have to shatter
[01:34:19.542 --> 01:34:24.925]  That illusion that we're not the majority and we have to get past the mind game of fear.
[01:34:25.326 --> 01:34:32.390]  And so I think it's a great idea whether it's anonymous, you write letters and post things, or other people should start other Oath Keeper sites, more groups, lots of people.
[01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:38.413]  But it's good, in my experience, just to go past the point of no return and to commit.
[01:34:38.453 --> 01:34:40.194]  We're only saying we'll follow our oath.
[01:34:40.835 --> 01:34:44.137]  I mean, that's how I got the city of Austin was saying they were going to vote against the Patriot Act.
[01:34:45.481 --> 01:34:46.141]  Repudiation.
[01:34:46.181 --> 01:34:48.462]  They were going to vote for the Patriot Act and keep it.
[01:34:48.522 --> 01:34:52.463]  And I went in there, and I gave them an impassioned, the most powerful speech I've probably ever given.
[01:34:52.483 --> 01:34:53.903]  It was directly from my soul.
[01:34:54.824 --> 01:34:56.704]  And I explained to them their children had no future.
[01:34:56.724 --> 01:34:59.645]  I explained to them all we were doing had no future.
[01:34:59.665 --> 01:35:00.365]  This continued.
[01:35:01.706 --> 01:35:03.946]  That all they were doing was reaffirming the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[01:35:03.986 --> 01:35:08.988]  All they were doing was saying they'd follow their oaths of office for the City Council, the police, the firemen, the workers.
[01:35:11.368 --> 01:35:15.952]  That they had to do it, and they did vote to overthrow it, and people that were saying they were going to vote against, voted for.
[01:35:16.392 --> 01:35:20.335]  Because, I mean, I poured everything into literally trying to reach in and grab them.
[01:35:20.716 --> 01:35:23.998]  You know, just literally brush up against their souls, and I did.
[01:35:24.018 --> 01:35:27.241]  You know, literally bending my will with goodness towards them.
[01:35:27.261 --> 01:35:29.222]  And believe me, that's what humanity's all about, folks.
[01:35:29.242 --> 01:35:31.264]  You've got power, you don't know you have.
[01:35:31.404 --> 01:35:35.247]  It's a survival mechanism with the truth to literally be able to reach out to people.
[01:35:35.628 --> 01:35:37.129]  When you're telling the truth, it's unstoppable.
[01:35:37.609 --> 01:35:45.036]  The Globalists are going to pull a lot of other tricks, but I wanted to, just in closing, Stewart Rhodes, get your take on that enemy attack angle, and has that already happened?
[01:35:46.112 --> 01:35:47.713]  Well, not yet, and here's what we're going to do.
[01:35:47.733 --> 01:35:50.955]  We're going to do the same thing that Congressman Paul did with his campaign.
[01:35:50.995 --> 01:35:59.339]  We're going to let the few... We've already got an officer in Houston who's volunteered to run our Facebook operation, and we encourage folks to start up meet-up groups.
[01:35:59.359 --> 01:36:06.443]  I mean, the website... We'd like people to send their testimonials to the website so everyone can go there and read the testimonials, and we don't screen anything.
[01:36:06.463 --> 01:36:07.843]  We post them, they send them, we post them.
[01:36:09.784 --> 01:36:16.266]  And by decentralizing with meetups, it turns the engine loose.
[01:36:16.326 --> 01:36:30.631]  We're no intelligence unit, no group in the government could track or trace or stop what we're doing or try dirty tricks on anybody because there's too many of us and agents that are assigned to try to infiltrate or cause problems will convert over to our side, I'd say 80% of the time.
[01:36:32.077 --> 01:36:32.477]  Exactly.
[01:36:32.537 --> 01:36:33.058]  Here's the other thing.
[01:36:33.078 --> 01:36:47.729]  We do encourage active duty to stay anonymous, unless their short timers are going to be getting out soon, or, you know, a few people standing up and making a convicted statement is fine, but for the most part, we do think it's probably wise for most of them just to send an anonymous statement.
[01:36:47.769 --> 01:36:49.110]  Well, that's their decision.
[01:36:49.210 --> 01:36:50.871]  I'm just saying most of this is anonymous.
[01:36:50.931 --> 01:36:52.993]  I'm saying we need more, I think, to go all the way.
[01:36:53.513 --> 01:36:57.016]  Because that's what's going to shatter the illusion of the establishment.
[01:36:58.135 --> 01:36:59.376]  I agree, but it's up to them.
[01:36:59.436 --> 01:37:01.617]  I want them to know they can do it anonymously.
[01:37:01.858 --> 01:37:07.441]  They can go on there and any discussion and just post an anonymous comment and we'll turn it into an anonymous post.
[01:37:08.042 --> 01:37:11.464]  And the veterans definitely should stand up and be counted, for sure.
[01:37:12.056 --> 01:37:18.041]  Yeah, I mean, they'll charge machine gun nests and fly helicopters into hell, but they won't stand up when the country's imploding.
[01:37:18.061 --> 01:37:19.001]  No, they are standing up.
[01:37:19.362 --> 01:37:21.283]  Sir, we commend you.
[01:37:21.864 --> 01:37:27.788]  The website again is oath-keepers.blogspot.com, or just Google Oath Keepers, and folks will find it that way.
[01:37:27.828 --> 01:37:28.869]  We'll talk to you in the near future.
[01:37:28.889 --> 01:37:29.890]  Awesome, sir.
[01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:31.711]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[01:37:32.151 --> 01:37:33.192]  Really great hearing from you.
[01:37:34.492 --> 01:37:39.095]  Okay, let's go to our next guest, lecturer and college instructor, Jeffrey Grubb.
[01:37:39.675 --> 01:37:43.918]  He wrote the book, Corporatism, the Secret Government of the New World Order, and they do use a corporate
[01:37:45.094 --> 01:37:47.815]  Model our finance oligarchs to control things.
[01:37:47.855 --> 01:37:48.736]  That is the real government.
[01:37:48.776 --> 01:37:49.396]  That's the elite.
[01:37:49.876 --> 01:37:54.098]  And there's Catholics, there's Jews, there's Protestants, there's Hindus in it.
[01:37:54.618 --> 01:38:00.541]  It's a system of global fiat currency control and corporate management system behind governments and through governments.
[01:38:00.961 --> 01:38:02.022]  And his book is excellent.
[01:38:02.382 --> 01:38:05.223]  Corporatism, The Secret Government of the New World Order, Jeffrey Grubb.
[01:38:05.563 --> 01:38:07.224]  An amazing book, a remarkable book.
[01:38:07.464 --> 01:38:10.585]  And it's just very, very interesting and we're glad to have him on with us.
[01:38:10.625 --> 01:38:11.486]  Sir, thanks for joining us.
[01:38:12.281 --> 01:38:13.082]  Thanks very much, Alex.
[01:38:13.102 --> 01:38:13.982]  I'm really happy to be on.
[01:38:14.042 --> 01:38:16.304]  I just want to say I'm a big admirer, a big fan of yours.
[01:38:16.845 --> 01:38:18.686]  What you're doing just gives me a lot of inspiration.
[01:38:19.226 --> 01:38:31.116]  We live in a nation full of men, young men especially, who are confused being raised by these fake churches and TV and public schools and they get to be 20, 30 years old, don't know what they're doing, don't know who they are.
[01:38:31.136 --> 01:38:36.580]  I think what you're doing is helping them learn how to be men by the entire nation, I would say.
[01:38:37.048 --> 01:38:41.472]  Yeah, we've never been given our true identity and people are unhappy until they find what the identity is.
[01:38:41.953 --> 01:38:42.633]  Fight for freedom.
[01:38:42.674 --> 01:38:43.314]  Fight for liberty.
[01:38:43.354 --> 01:38:43.875]  Be informed.
[01:38:43.915 --> 01:38:44.435]  Be involved.
[01:38:44.475 --> 01:38:45.296]  Engage the world.
[01:38:45.536 --> 01:38:46.417]  You're only alive once.
[01:38:46.697 --> 01:38:47.558]  Tell us about yourself.
[01:38:47.578 --> 01:38:48.319]  Tell us about the book.
[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:56.267]  Okay, I think one of the reasons that you wanted me to come on was I just recently got fired from Purdue University for an incident that happened with a gun.
[01:38:56.307 --> 01:38:59.970]  It was actually my second incident with a gun at the university.
[01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:03.311]  And, well, anyway, about me, my name is Jeffrey Grubb.
[01:39:03.771 --> 01:39:07.453]  I am the author of a book, Corporatism, which is published by Progressive Press.
[01:39:07.493 --> 01:39:08.294]  It's on Amazon.
[01:39:09.014 --> 01:39:17.620]  And I'm 38, been an instructor in philosophy at a number of schools in northern Indiana, and I was fired from two of them.
[01:39:17.841 --> 01:39:27.147]  Actually, the first time I was fired was from Indiana University for talking about vaccines and the New World Order and 9-11 and a bioethics class, and they sure didn't like that too much and got rid of me real quick.
[01:39:27.691 --> 01:39:35.415]  I've got a lot of publications and I look pretty good on paper to the university, so I got another job real quick in the Purdue University system where I've been getting my PhD.
[01:39:35.455 --> 01:39:36.696]  I'm actually a lecturer.
[01:39:36.736 --> 01:39:42.619]  It's a non-PhD teacher at a university.
[01:39:42.899 --> 01:39:53.765]  I was teaching at Purdue North Central up in northern Indiana, which is a branch campus of Purdue University, and I had requested to teach in the prisons because they have a little program where they teach in
[01:39:54.648 --> 01:40:01.890]  I teach inmates in the prisons and I've been doing it for the last 18 months or so and I was on my way to work, I think it was February 24 or so.
[01:40:02.491 --> 01:40:08.132]  Rushing around like crazy and I'm really busy writing books, taking care of my family, working two jobs, etc.
[01:40:08.633 --> 01:40:22.297]  No, you're just like Jimmy Johnson who twice has tried to take his handgun, because he gets death threats and stuff, why couldn't he, you know, onto the airplane and they scan the briefcase and there's the gun, so a similar thing happened to you.
[01:40:23.491 --> 01:40:27.294]  Yeah, the nation's full of these anti-Second Amendment zones.
[01:40:27.334 --> 01:40:34.941]  I forgot to take my gun out of my school supplies because I had it on me because I was running errands during the morning before I went up to teach at the prison.
[01:40:35.861 --> 01:40:41.025]  Of course, the media won't report on depleted uranium and the burning of the rainforest and all this kind of stuff.
[01:40:41.045 --> 01:40:43.588]  What they want to do is report on me, a professor.
[01:40:43.648 --> 01:40:44.889]  Well, I'm called a lecturer.
[01:40:44.909 --> 01:40:47.170]  I forgot to take my gun out of my school supplies.
[01:40:47.190 --> 01:40:50.173]  It's in the Indianapolis Star and the Chicago Tribune.
[01:40:50.768 --> 01:40:51.829]  They get the story all wrong.
[01:40:51.849 --> 01:40:54.612]  They say, you know, I was trying to smuggle the gun and all this crazy stuff.
[01:40:54.792 --> 01:40:59.277]  And it's just, it's just pretty amazing that that's what, it just shows that that's what the media is all about.
[01:40:59.297 --> 01:41:00.918]  The mainstream media, that's what they're going to fail.
[01:41:01.339 --> 01:41:05.323]  You know, the future is, is us, is this, this voice, you know, against the new old order.
[01:41:05.343 --> 01:41:14.132]  I think a lot of these universities are going to, you know, we're just beginning this economic crisis and it's, you know, a lot of universities when this economic crisis really gets going, you know, later this year, into next year,
[01:41:14.744 --> 01:41:25.969]  A lot of them are going to fail, and I think eventually with American Revolution II starting here, we're going to get new universities, or the ones that exist are going to be heavily modified, and I think our information, our voice, I think is the future there.
[01:41:26.089 --> 01:41:29.271]  So, I mean, I don't, you know, that I got fired from my job, really I don't care.
[01:41:29.291 --> 01:41:32.552]  I've been teaching for eight years, you know, all summer, a lot of classes.
[01:41:32.592 --> 01:41:36.374]  I'm anxious to take some time off, and plus, I don't really know where I fit in these schools anymore.
[01:41:36.394 --> 01:41:40.056]  I mean, these universities, they're not teaching empirical information.
[01:41:40.689 --> 01:41:53.498]  I mean, it's hard for people to understand this if you're not really in the university system paying attention to what's going on, but they're not, you know, you don't get into a class and sit there and tell your students, okay, I got this scientific article from this top journal and this scientific article from this article from this top journal.
[01:41:53.538 --> 01:41:57.581]  We're going to just debate these and we're going to get to the bottom of things and we're going to be empirical researchers.
[01:41:57.601 --> 01:41:59.242]  That almost never happens anywhere.
[01:41:59.262 --> 01:42:05.826]  Well, they teach you the German 200-year-old model of not learning how to think and learning how magical the world is and how things connect.
[01:42:06.307 --> 01:42:09.509]  It's all just by rote, regurgitating information.
[01:42:10.356 --> 01:42:11.397]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:11.417 --> 01:42:12.818]  Well, they've got these agendas.
[01:42:12.838 --> 01:42:19.722]  Like, when I was teaching bioethics at Indiana University Northwest, which I was fired from, they wanted me to teach this bioethics class.
[01:42:19.762 --> 01:42:21.003]  And I said, OK, that sounds great.
[01:42:21.023 --> 01:42:21.503]  I'd love to.
[01:42:21.944 --> 01:42:24.345]  Didn't have a whole lot of background in it, but I said I'll do it because I could use it.
[01:42:24.445 --> 01:42:26.727]  And it was really a eugenics class they wanted to teach here.
[01:42:26.767 --> 01:42:27.067]  Yeah.
[01:42:27.407 --> 01:42:31.850]  Yeah, they wanted me to teach eugenics, which, you know, it doesn't really... By the way, we've never talked before.
[01:42:31.930 --> 01:42:33.531]  I just knew that because that's what they teach.
[01:42:33.572 --> 01:42:33.952]  But go ahead.
[01:42:35.014 --> 01:42:35.875]  Yeah, no, right.
[01:42:35.915 --> 01:42:38.396]  Well, they wanted me to teach about euthanasia and all this stuff.
[01:42:38.416 --> 01:42:39.717]  And I said, you know, it's not really relevant.
[01:42:39.957 --> 01:42:43.099]  You know, I'm wasting the students' money, not really teaching them relevant information.
[01:42:43.119 --> 01:42:46.181]  So what I did is I just, on my own, got rid of that section of the class.
[01:42:46.422 --> 01:42:47.782]  Yeah, it's brainwashing!
[01:42:48.383 --> 01:42:53.786]  You pay $30,000 a year or whatever to go be brainwashed and taught a bunch of propaganda instead of information.
[01:42:53.806 --> 01:42:54.987]  Go ahead.
[01:42:55.007 --> 01:42:59.250]  Yeah, it's absolutely unbelievable that people don't just wake up and say, what am I doing here?
[01:42:59.270 --> 01:43:00.551]  I mean, I take a calculus class.
[01:43:01.041 --> 01:43:04.884]  We really only learn about four concepts the whole semester, and I never use any of this stuff ever again.
[01:43:04.904 --> 01:43:06.365]  That's why I dropped out of college.
[01:43:06.405 --> 01:43:11.790]  I was ma- I mean, it was like, I'd go to math class, and it'd be how we've got to get rid of the most of the population, guns are bad.
[01:43:12.190 --> 01:43:15.313]  I'd go to, uh, you know, philosophy class, it was all New World Order.
[01:43:15.553 --> 01:43:17.534]  I'd go to Texas history, it'd all be New World Order.
[01:43:17.775 --> 01:43:18.435]  I'd go to U.S.
[01:43:18.455 --> 01:43:19.636]  history, it'd all be New World Order.
[01:43:19.936 --> 01:43:22.779]  It didn't matter what class, art class, it'd be New World Order.
[01:43:22.819 --> 01:43:24.300]  I mean, just everywhere, it's brainwashing.
[01:43:25.017 --> 01:43:27.820]  Yeah, people don't pick up on this because they do it in a hidden way.
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:31.523]  Some classes won't talk about eugenics, so what they'll do is talk about global warming.
[01:43:31.864 --> 01:43:38.850]  It'll act like everybody's in agreement and you get the two students in the back who are questioning it and then all the rest of the students gang up against them.
[01:43:39.391 --> 01:43:40.232]  People don't know
[01:43:40.965 --> 01:43:43.187]  I mean, brainwashing in the universities is really serious.
[01:43:43.287 --> 01:43:45.089]  They're re-education camps.
[01:43:45.309 --> 01:43:46.410]  They're re-education camps.
[01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:47.170]  Military, same thing.
[01:43:47.210 --> 01:43:48.331]  Shaved heads, sleep deprivation.
[01:43:48.351 --> 01:43:49.813]  And this is what people don't understand.
[01:43:50.193 --> 01:43:51.394]  This is all 200 years old.
[01:43:51.434 --> 01:43:52.715]  It all comes out of Germany and England.
[01:43:53.295 --> 01:43:58.420]  And before education wasn't like this... I mean, everything you're saying is true, just because I've researched it myself.
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:01.542]  That's what's great about talking to somebody else who's researched this with your perspective.
[01:44:02.363 --> 01:44:07.666]  We're going to come back, get more into your book, and I'm going to try to shut up and get into your The Corporatism Secret, Government of the New World Order.
[01:44:07.686 --> 01:44:17.132]  It's published by Webster Tarpley's publisher, I thought I would add, so to give you an idea of the caliber of the material, and Progressive Press, so we really appreciate having you on the show with us.
[01:44:17.152 --> 01:44:19.733]  We're going to come right back to you after this break, but...
[01:44:20.774 --> 01:44:27.779]  Yeah, I mean, you pay after 12 years of your children being brainwashed at government schools to send them to another re-education camp.
[01:44:28.079 --> 01:44:31.201]  And folks, when I say re-education camp, they are re-education camps.
[01:44:31.841 --> 01:44:37.185]  I mean, re-education, Soviet Nazi system, that is what goes on at most universities.
[01:44:37.545 --> 01:44:43.949]  You got some good professors and teachers who aren't like that, but overall, it is a brainwashing mess.
[01:44:43.969 --> 01:44:47.212]  I mean, they tried to recruit my dad into eugenics when he went to UT in the 60s.
[01:44:48.976 --> 01:44:50.157]  Hello, this is Steve Shank.
[01:44:50.337 --> 01:44:52.598]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[01:44:52.738 --> 01:44:56.741]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[01:44:56.901 --> 01:45:00.583]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:45:00.663 --> 01:45:09.128]  If you agree with one guy screaming about global warming instead of 650 climatologists who know the Earth is cooling, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:45:09.228 --> 01:45:12.850]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:18.473]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:45:24.258 --> 01:45:25.139]  We're good to go.
[01:45:49.409 --> 01:45:51.549]  Peter Kronshamble here from Midas Resources.
[01:45:51.850 --> 01:45:54.290]  Are you concerned about uncontrollable government spending?
[01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:56.751]  A banking system on the verge of collapse?
[01:45:57.331 --> 01:45:59.231]  Banks on the edge of being nationalized?
[01:45:59.771 --> 01:46:01.652]  Wall Street and continuous free fall?
[01:46:02.232 --> 01:46:04.552]  Scandal after scandal with hedge funds companies?
[01:46:05.112 --> 01:46:09.973]  If protecting your hard-earned savings or retirement fund is on your mind, the answer is simple.
[01:46:10.493 --> 01:46:12.994]  Secure your assets by purchasing gold and silver.
[01:46:13.559 --> 01:46:21.774]  Since President Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1971, the United States has been operating the longest running fiat currency in the history of mankind.
[01:46:22.481 --> 01:46:25.563]  Gold has held its purchasing power for over 6,000 years.
[01:46:26.043 --> 01:46:28.284]  Contact me, Peter Kronschnabel, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:46:28.504 --> 01:46:29.785]  Once again, that's Peter at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:46:29.825 --> 01:46:31.165]  While you can still purchase gold with paper.
[01:46:31.225 --> 01:46:31.906]  That is 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:46:32.006 --> 01:46:33.527]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:46:52.436 --> 01:46:54.496]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:46:55.297 --> 01:47:00.640]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:07.363]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:47:07.663 --> 01:47:09.484]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:47:09.644 --> 01:47:12.025]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:47:12.105 --> 01:47:22.991]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:47:25.288 --> 01:47:26.569]  It's not about left or right.
[01:47:26.949 --> 01:47:28.349]  It's about a one world government.
[01:47:28.809 --> 01:47:35.152]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:47:43.975 --> 01:47:45.115]  The Obama Deception.
[01:47:45.555 --> 01:47:46.736]  The people strike back.
[01:47:48.698 --> 01:47:52.981]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:47:53.222 --> 01:47:58.125]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:47:58.325 --> 01:47:59.666]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:47:59.827 --> 01:48:03.309]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:48:23.625 --> 01:48:24.566]  No animal testing.
[01:48:24.806 --> 01:48:26.127]  I use them and love them.
[01:48:26.147 --> 01:48:27.749]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[01:48:28.029 --> 01:48:29.110]  And I save big time.
[01:48:29.450 --> 01:48:30.671]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.

[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:47.562]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[01:48:48.902 --> 01:48:50.983]  No matter how hard you try,
[01:49:27.015 --> 01:49:34.380]  Alright, let's go back to our guest, Jeffrey Grubb.
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:35.521]  Jeffrey, continue.
[01:49:35.541 --> 01:49:40.525]  Let's get into your book, Corporatism, The Secret Government of the New World Order.
[01:49:41.705 --> 01:49:44.848]  Yeah, that book was written from 2003 to 2007.
[01:49:45.048 --> 01:49:49.971]  When 9-11 happened, I was deep in my academic studies getting my master's degree, and I really didn't even pay attention.
[01:49:50.031 --> 01:49:52.693]  I actually tried as best as I could to ignore all politics.
[01:49:54.054 --> 01:49:55.415]  Ignore everything about the world.
[01:49:55.435 --> 01:49:56.395]  I just thought it was a complete joke.
[01:49:56.415 --> 01:49:57.236]  I didn't want to pay attention.
[01:49:57.256 --> 01:49:58.356]  I just wanted to do my academic work.
[01:49:58.376 --> 01:50:00.497]  But then, 2003 happened.
[01:50:00.537 --> 01:50:01.158]  March 20th.
[01:50:02.198 --> 01:50:03.338]  I forgot exactly.
[01:50:03.358 --> 01:50:04.819]  The 19th, when we invaded Iraq.
[01:50:04.839 --> 01:50:10.342]  I was sitting there in Applebee's with my father, having a happy little lunch, watching people of Baghdad get blown to bits.
[01:50:10.862 --> 01:50:13.203]  And that completely shocked me, unbelievably.
[01:50:13.263 --> 01:50:15.364]  And from that point on, I've been distracted.
[01:50:15.644 --> 01:50:17.365]  My academic work has been distracted.
[01:50:17.745 --> 01:50:20.386]  All I can really focus on is what exactly is going on in the world.
[01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:24.873]  The book, Corporatism, is my process of trying to figure out what's going on in the world.
[01:50:24.913 --> 01:50:26.153]  It took me four years to write.
[01:50:26.193 --> 01:50:31.877]  I basically researched it 100 hours a week or more to get that book to be completed.
[01:50:31.897 --> 01:50:34.459]  Of course, you're quoted in the book about 30 times, Alex.
[01:50:34.499 --> 01:50:35.840]  I've been listening to you ever since 2003.
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:40.723]  Where else am I going to get this information?
[01:50:40.803 --> 01:50:42.864]  You guys report all this stuff.
[01:50:42.944 --> 01:50:45.146]  It's really hard to find any really good information.
[01:50:46.227 --> 01:50:55.269]  Um, but the book is, uh, I think, there's only one problem, I think, with it, you know, like you said the other day about the Obama deception, you, you know, after you finish something, you find out things you wish you added later.
[01:50:55.289 --> 01:51:01.670]  There's a couple things I wish I added later, but the book basically, to sum it up, is about how the secret government works.
[01:51:01.690 --> 01:51:03.970]  The secret government is basically invisible.
[01:51:04.010 --> 01:51:12.192]  I mean, people like Rockefeller and stuff, um, are getting close to the core of it, but, uh, you know, the people we see on TV, what I call the visible government,
[01:51:12.611 --> 01:51:15.112]  We're showing these people on TV, you know, Obama.
[01:51:15.172 --> 01:51:18.493]  You remember the election was happening and we were basically told who to vote for.
[01:51:18.513 --> 01:51:20.734]  The public didn't even know who Ron Paul was until late in the game.
[01:51:20.754 --> 01:51:23.875]  Yeah, they spent billions manufacturing this guy.
[01:51:23.935 --> 01:51:25.376]  That's prima facie evidence.
[01:51:25.396 --> 01:51:26.116]  He's New World Order.
[01:51:26.376 --> 01:51:27.377]  Then all his advisors.
[01:51:27.417 --> 01:51:28.277]  Now the policies.
[01:51:28.317 --> 01:51:29.077]  Now the betrayals.
[01:51:29.557 --> 01:51:34.019]  I mean, you know, he comes out and says, I am against these bailouts and these bonuses.
[01:51:34.139 --> 01:51:34.859]  I'm fighting it.
[01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:40.942]  And it turns out he specifically signed an executive order to allow it and had Dodd put it in the law
[01:51:41.562 --> 01:51:43.043]  And that's now mainstream news.
[01:51:43.103 --> 01:51:44.423]  Well, I knew that months ago.
[01:51:44.463 --> 01:51:46.244]  We put it in the Obama Deception that was just released.
[01:51:46.844 --> 01:51:48.585]  But that's now mainstream news today.
[01:51:49.565 --> 01:51:58.289]  Yeah, Obama's specifically doing the neocon agenda where you say one thing, and you purposely say exactly the opposite of what you're implementing.
[01:51:58.309 --> 01:52:02.890]  So he'll say, I'm against AIG and the banks, and go on the TV and scold them and stuff.
[01:52:02.930 --> 01:52:09.653]  But then he's, like you say in the Obama Deception, he's the guy behind the whole thing as far as the puppet government goes.
[01:52:10.151 --> 01:52:10.551]  We're good to go.
[01:52:27.563 --> 01:52:30.965]  Killing people for some sort of enjoyment or pleasure that they have.
[01:52:30.985 --> 01:52:32.646]  It's some sort of religion.
[01:52:32.666 --> 01:52:34.988]  So that's the summation of your research, which is true.
[01:52:35.088 --> 01:52:37.509]  You could be an atheist and come to that realization.
[01:52:37.529 --> 01:52:38.750]  People are like, I don't believe in that.
[01:52:38.810 --> 01:52:40.091]  I'm an atheist or I'm an agnostic.
[01:52:40.351 --> 01:52:41.812]  Point is, the globalists believe in it.
[01:52:42.172 --> 01:52:43.653]  I mean, they are into this stuff.
[01:52:43.693 --> 01:52:45.034]  They are out of their minds.
[01:52:45.914 --> 01:52:47.555]  Actually, Alex, I used to be an atheist.
[01:52:47.575 --> 01:52:51.538]  I even published an academic article in a top philosophy journal called Sophia.
[01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:54.451]  I'm trying to prove that God didn't exist.
[01:52:54.791 --> 01:53:00.474]  Way back deep into the 90s, I was so angry with my upbringing and the horrible church that I was raised in.
[01:53:00.514 --> 01:53:02.555]  I just became this fiery, bitter atheist.
[01:53:02.955 --> 01:53:06.737]  I read a book in the last few years called Beginning Sacred Design by Bonnie Gaunt.
[01:53:07.399 --> 01:53:12.923]  Pretty much, I can't believe that nobody's talking about this information in the churches or on TV.
[01:53:12.943 --> 01:53:22.949]  Well, that's why a lot of top scientists who have been atheists, when they finally look at DNA under electron microscopes and the layers and how there's, you know, in there, they're like, my God, this is designed.
[01:53:23.369 --> 01:53:25.471]  I mean, this didn't come out of a cabbage patch.
[01:53:26.181 --> 01:53:26.841]  It's everywhere.
[01:53:26.861 --> 01:53:27.942]  Look at the solar system.
[01:53:28.502 --> 01:53:33.044]  When you look at the numbers of the solar system, the diameter of the sun, moon, earth, the ratios of all these diameters.
[01:53:34.985 --> 01:53:38.846]  Where we had to be in the galaxy, it's all perfect.
[01:53:39.867 --> 01:53:45.829]  Take Newgrange up in Ireland, that ancient temple, about 2000 BC, it's estimated to have been created.
[01:53:46.289 --> 01:53:50.571]  The sun, I think it's the winter solstice, there's one beam of light that
[01:53:51.164 --> 01:53:51.745]  We're good to go.
[01:54:15.746 --> 01:54:21.090]  Those very precise dates are traveling exactly the same trajectory through the sky without any deviation.
[01:54:21.691 --> 01:54:23.712]  Now, that can't be a coincidence.
[01:54:23.752 --> 01:54:24.893]  That's unbelievable.
[01:54:25.133 --> 01:54:26.914]  I could name 20 of those coincidences.
[01:54:27.275 --> 01:54:27.875]  Let's do it.
[01:54:27.915 --> 01:54:28.476]  Let me come back.
[01:54:28.596 --> 01:54:29.416]  No, let's do it if you want.
[01:54:29.436 --> 01:54:32.499]  Let's get into the book and a lot more with our guest, folks.
[01:54:32.519 --> 01:54:35.981]  The book is Corporatism, the Secret Government of the New World Order, Jeffrey Grubb.
[01:54:36.041 --> 01:54:37.382]  I suggest you get it today.
[01:54:39.164 --> 01:54:40.084]  We're on the march.
[01:54:40.565 --> 01:54:42.046]  The empire's on the run.
[01:54:43.052 --> 01:54:45.853]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:49.295 --> 01:54:52.156]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.
[01:54:52.676 --> 01:54:59.859]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[01:55:00.399 --> 01:55:07.662]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family, the time to act is now.
[01:55:08.242 --> 01:55:09.483]  At HempUSA.org,
[01:55:10.307 --> 01:55:14.568]  We still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying times ahead.

[01:55:47.751 --> 01:55:54.437]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:55:54.937 --> 01:56:01.944]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:56:02.489 --> 01:56:08.672]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:56:09.072 --> 01:56:10.893]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:56:11.053 --> 01:56:13.455]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:56:13.555 --> 01:56:24.500]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:26.421]  It's not about left or right.
[01:56:26.801 --> 01:56:28.142]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:56:28.641 --> 01:56:34.966]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:56:43.812 --> 01:56:44.973]  The Obama Deception.
[01:56:45.393 --> 01:56:46.594]  The people strike back.
[01:56:48.254 --> 01:56:52.115]  Do you suffer from aches and pains in your knees, arms, wrists, or elbows?
[01:56:52.435 --> 01:56:55.736]  Is it difficult to get out of bed in the morning because of joint stiffness?
[01:56:56.077 --> 01:56:59.478]  Have you been looking for a safe, natural alternative to help ease your pain?

[01:57:34.141 --> 01:57:35.883]  That's solar, T-H-E-R-M, solartherm.ca.
[01:57:55.385 --> 01:58:03.450]  Laundry through Friday, we're here live 11 to 3 p.m.
[01:58:03.570 --> 01:58:04.651]  Central Standard Time Sundays.
[01:58:04.671 --> 01:58:06.432]  4 to 6 p.m.
[01:58:06.552 --> 01:58:08.073]  for an abbreviated Sunday transmission.
[01:58:08.093 --> 01:58:10.295]  Don't forget Jason Burmiss, the Info Warrior.
[01:58:10.315 --> 01:58:13.357]  That's the name of the show, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:58:13.377 --> 01:58:14.717]  That's 10 p.m.
[01:58:14.737 --> 01:58:15.358]  to 1 a.m.
[01:58:15.518 --> 01:58:15.978]  Eastern.
[01:58:16.398 --> 01:58:18.480]  Chival Castle GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:21.127 --> 01:58:24.388]  He's been having a lot of great guests in studio and on the phone with him.
[01:58:24.889 --> 01:58:28.550]  It's all simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv for three hours, nine to midnight.
[01:58:28.610 --> 01:58:32.412]  We've been here today for the last few hours, so most days we do large portions of the show.
[01:58:32.432 --> 01:58:33.432]  Every day we do at least two hours.
[01:58:35.513 --> 01:58:36.954]  I want to go back to our guest.
[01:58:37.074 --> 01:58:38.814]  We're not going to have any time for calls today.
[01:58:38.854 --> 01:58:39.775]  We've had so many guests on.
[01:58:40.195 --> 01:58:41.316]  We will have a lot of calls tomorrow.
[01:58:42.136 --> 01:58:45.777]  Corporatism, the secret government of the New World Order, but he'll be on hold a few minutes.
[01:58:45.797 --> 01:58:48.559]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up right now because
[01:58:49.740 --> 01:58:52.914]  Every time gold goes down, and the graph goes like this, you know.
[01:58:53.539 --> 01:59:00.365]  It's the last five years going up, but every time it dips, Ted buys it when it's low, and then he doesn't raise the price to the current rate.
[01:59:00.405 --> 01:59:01.626]  He passes it on to you.
[01:59:02.146 --> 01:59:03.567]  Because Ted understands psychology.
[01:59:03.587 --> 01:59:05.349]  Some of these people buy when it's high.
[01:59:05.429 --> 01:59:06.249]  I buy when it's low.
[01:59:07.050 --> 01:59:08.071]  Well, he passes that on.
[01:59:08.111 --> 01:59:10.293]  You're buying it at the low price when it's gone up.
[01:59:10.313 --> 01:59:11.393]  It went up 30 bucks yesterday.
[01:59:11.413 --> 01:59:12.614]  It's gone up like 15 today.
[01:59:13.355 --> 01:59:14.536]  Skyrocketing back upwards.
[01:59:14.656 --> 01:59:17.438]  I don't know what the future holds, but I know gold and silver is real.
[01:59:17.899 --> 01:59:19.160]  I know they're devaluing the dollar.
[01:59:19.180 --> 01:59:20.941]  They're openly talking about abandoning the dollar.
[01:59:20.981 --> 01:59:21.802]  If that happens, you know,
[01:59:22.142 --> 01:59:24.165]  I got articles here, in fact, I meant to get to.
[01:59:24.185 --> 01:59:29.591]  $750 billion green investment could revive economy, UN says.
[01:59:29.972 --> 01:59:32.135]  They're calling for a world tax on all fuel.
[01:59:32.155 --> 01:59:34.958]  And if you think $750 billion is big, that's just how they're going to start.
[01:59:34.978 --> 01:59:35.919]  The income tax started at 1%.
[01:59:37.577 --> 01:59:40.578]  It wasn't widely adopted until the 50s, though they passed it in 1913.
[01:59:41.099 --> 01:59:43.560]  So, I mean, this is insane, the stuff.
[01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:50.963]  I mean, here's London Telegraph, where they're talking about yesterday, issuing their own global super currency, and then another article said, oh, they're already doing it.
[01:59:51.543 --> 01:59:55.585]  So, Ted Anderson, you've got silver, you've got gold at insane deals.
[01:59:56.025 --> 02:00:02.548]  Out of the gates, we always run out of time, give folks the group of coins you're offering today at the insane price of
[02:00:03.493 --> 02:00:04.774]  Would you buy this when it was down by $70?
[02:00:04.834 --> 02:00:14.763]  Yeah, Alex, right when the market dipped there, I took advantage of those low prices and now we have gold trading around $9.60, which is up again today.
[02:00:15.510 --> 02:00:18.072]  That news that the Fed's going in there buying U.S.
[02:00:18.132 --> 02:00:20.933]  Treasuries is just driving gold up through the roof.
[02:00:20.953 --> 02:00:26.296]  That means the private bankers are selling themselves Treasuries taxpayer-backed.
[02:00:26.336 --> 02:00:30.998]  The foreigners aren't buying enough of it to keep us afloat and they're moving away fast.
[02:00:31.299 --> 02:00:33.159]  If folks don't know what that means, why don't you tell them, Ted?
[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:35.401]  Well, it just means that we're going to see inflation.
[02:00:35.741 --> 02:00:41.464]  I mean, you think you've had an assault on your stocks and bonds and your 401k plans and your IRAs now.
[02:00:41.980 --> 02:00:43.861]  Just wait until inflation starts coming.
[02:00:44.041 --> 02:00:48.363]  Everybody knows now that we're looking at some huge inflation in the future here.
[02:00:48.863 --> 02:00:51.205]  They just said yesterday, record inflation.
[02:00:51.665 --> 02:00:53.626]  Record inflation in the last 20 years just came in.
[02:00:54.126 --> 02:00:58.488]  Yeah, that's what everybody's pointing at right now because when the Federal Reserve System buys U.S.
[02:00:58.508 --> 02:01:01.189]  government treasuries, it means they're printing money.
[02:01:01.690 --> 02:01:02.450]  That's what it means.
[02:01:02.610 --> 02:01:06.912]  And folks, inflation means the dollars are worthless.
[02:01:07.192 --> 02:01:09.193]  I know this sounds stupid, but some people are elementary.
[02:01:09.213 --> 02:01:10.114]  I'm going to be simple here.
[02:01:11.014 --> 02:01:18.139]  When there's inflation, commodities, especially those that have true value as currency, gold and silver, historically only go up.
[02:01:19.140 --> 02:01:22.962]  It's the most active time in trading for gold and silver that you can ever hope for.
[02:01:22.982 --> 02:01:29.487]  I mean, back in 1980, gold went from $40 an ounce to $800 an ounce in about six years.
[02:01:30.127 --> 02:01:36.532]  And now we're starting at a level of about $300, and if the same movement comes along, we're going to be looking at $4,000, $5,000, maybe even $6,000 gold.
[02:01:38.959 --> 02:01:44.282]  And this is the answers that our government and the Federal Reserve System has for us.
[02:01:44.742 --> 02:01:46.023]  And you're right, the U.N.
[02:01:46.063 --> 02:01:50.126]  is trying to get away from using the United States currency as a world reserve currency.
[02:01:50.146 --> 02:01:51.046]  That's going to kill us.
[02:01:51.686 --> 02:01:55.088]  We have to have foreigners buying our debt in order to survive.
[02:01:55.209 --> 02:02:02.453]  This is a slow slide into depression, but if the dollar gets dumped, which is openly being discussed, it will be an overnight crash.
[02:02:03.888 --> 02:02:09.691]  Well, Alex, when I was up on the air just at the very end of the show yesterday, I told you I had some deals in here.
[02:02:10.071 --> 02:02:11.171]  I have francs still.
[02:02:11.712 --> 02:02:15.133]  Same price I had them yesterday, even though gold is up again so much today.
[02:02:15.153 --> 02:02:18.655]  I have francs still from the time when gold was sitting here at its bottom.
[02:02:19.055 --> 02:02:22.457]  At $218, I've got British sovereigns at $272.
[02:02:22.877 --> 02:02:23.497]  Silver's up.
[02:02:23.557 --> 02:02:26.178]  I still have the Franklin halves at $869 apiece, or $173 per roll of $20.
[02:02:29.887 --> 02:02:31.969]  And I have some of the U.S.
[02:02:32.109 --> 02:02:36.372]  Eagles and some of the various different coins that you can find in the gold market.
[02:02:36.392 --> 02:02:39.214]  You're going to have to ask for those because I just don't have enough quantities to go out.
[02:02:39.675 --> 02:02:41.556]  We have $20 gold pieces and tens.
[02:02:41.876 --> 02:02:47.441]  Just call 1-800-686-2237 and take advantage of this.
[02:02:47.761 --> 02:02:53.105]  The market is going up right now and it'll continue to go up as the Fed steps in and inflates away.
[02:02:55.855 --> 02:02:58.656]  Deficit spend our way out of our problems.
[02:02:58.697 --> 02:03:05.200]  And to explain to people what's going on, you have gold at, is it $60 or $70 under what it's currently selling for?
[02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:09.442]  Well that's the thing Alex, it was what, around $890 when it hit its low here last time?
[02:03:09.482 --> 02:03:14.984]  So that's a $70 under buy you made, you're passing those savings on, you cannot beat this deal.
[02:03:15.004 --> 02:03:15.885]  Tell them the coin's dead.
[02:03:16.165 --> 02:03:19.346]  Yeah, again, the Frank coin right now is at $218.
[02:03:19.827 --> 02:03:21.367]  The Sovereign coin right now is at $272.
[02:03:23.021 --> 02:03:27.305]  The Franklin half is right now at $8.69.
[02:03:28.186 --> 02:03:29.127]  That's a silver coin.
[02:03:29.527 --> 02:03:31.689]  I mean, people should be buying gold and silver right now.
[02:03:31.949 --> 02:03:34.672]  Inflation is going to push this stuff up through the rough.
[02:03:34.872 --> 02:03:39.076]  Yeah, the silver coin is $8.80-something cents.
[02:03:39.136 --> 02:03:41.898]  I mean, silver dollars, if you can find them, are over $20 apiece, Ted.
[02:03:42.399 --> 02:03:42.719]  I know.
[02:03:43.019 --> 02:03:46.763]  They've been trading for more than $20 here for almost the last year.
[02:03:46.863 --> 02:03:48.684]  Every now and then you're lucky to get something for $18.
[02:03:49.798 --> 02:03:50.939]  You know, and here this thing is $8.69.
[02:03:50.979 --> 02:03:52.160]  I mean, it is really a good buy.
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:52.820]  It is.
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:53.381]  800-686-2237.
[02:03:53.401 --> 02:03:53.441]  1-800.
[02:03:53.461 --> 02:03:54.421]  Give them the number, folks.
[02:03:54.642 --> 02:03:55.782]  Yeah, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:03:55.842 --> 02:03:56.543]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:04:08.905 --> 02:04:12.908]  2237, man, pull your head out of the sand, get as much gold and silver as you can at this time.
[02:04:13.528 --> 02:04:14.589]  I can't say that enough.
[02:04:14.909 --> 02:04:17.872]  It's not just... 1-800-686-237.
[02:04:18.092 --> 02:04:21.935]  Did you hear that state police officer who broke the MIAC report here on last hour?
[02:04:21.975 --> 02:04:25.057]  And he said, he said, Alex, you told me to get out of the stock market two and a half years ago.
[02:04:25.538 --> 02:04:26.598]  At the top, I did it.
[02:04:26.618 --> 02:04:28.700]  You told me to get out of my house two and a half years ago.
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:29.060]  I did it.
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:30.742]  I've made hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[02:04:30.782 --> 02:04:34.184]  Everybody else, you know, is losing their butt in his state police office.
[02:04:34.224 --> 02:04:34.745]  He's senior.
[02:04:35.565 --> 02:04:36.806]  I can't say it better than that, Alex.
[02:04:36.926 --> 02:04:40.888]  At this time, if you're sitting in annuity stocks, bonds, mutual funds, you have 401Ks, IRAs, you should be calling us at 1-800
[02:05:04.522 --> 02:05:05.102]  6-8-6, 2-2-3-7.
[02:05:05.803 --> 02:05:09.488]  The only excuse is, is that you're out of paper currency.
[02:05:09.508 --> 02:05:10.369]  You don't have any more.
[02:05:10.930 --> 02:05:12.652]  I just don't, I can't say it enough.
[02:05:12.952 --> 02:05:14.915]  The United States dollar is under attack.
[02:05:15.475 --> 02:05:16.777]  And you better do something about it.
[02:05:17.156 --> 02:05:21.300]  And if you can't see the tidal wave coming, you're going to get drowned.
[02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:21.360]  800-686-237.
[02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:29.587]  And when I was first telling folks to get gold, it was $280, $267 an ounce, and it's been above $1,000.
[02:05:30.087 --> 02:05:31.168]  It's going back that way now.
[02:05:31.989 --> 02:05:34.211]  Ted's selling it to you at the $890 level.
[02:05:34.271 --> 02:05:36.933]  So, I mean, if you do the math, he's selling it at the $890 level.
[02:05:37.074 --> 02:05:38.955]  You know, there's tiny markup in there and things.
[02:05:39.336 --> 02:05:40.917]  He's selling it to you at the $890 level when it's $960.
[02:05:43.739 --> 02:05:43.879]  800-686-2237.
[02:05:46.161 --> 02:05:47.242]  Ted, thanks for talking to us.
[02:05:47.262 --> 02:05:48.382]  The Brokers will be there until midnight.
[02:05:48.582 --> 02:05:50.544]  Yeah, well, thanks for putting such a great show on.
[02:05:50.584 --> 02:05:51.304]  I'll talk to you later.
[02:05:51.684 --> 02:05:52.185]  Thank you, Ted.
[02:05:52.205 --> 02:05:54.887]  Oh, what did you think about Ron Paul and they were about to threaten to sue?
[02:05:55.587 --> 02:05:56.327]  They're writing a letter.
[02:05:56.588 --> 02:06:01.571]  They're threatening to sue Missouri if they don't retract all that slander and that MIAC report.
[02:06:02.211 --> 02:06:12.278]  I know, I listen to that part of your show and I tell you what, it makes my blood pressure go up because I'm going to be down there in Missouri with Ron Paul next Friday and Saturday and Sunday and I got to tell you,
[02:06:12.659 --> 02:06:14.360]  There isn't a better statesman out there.
[02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:18.682]  I can't believe that anybody would stand and let something like this happen.
[02:06:18.802 --> 02:06:20.123]  Well, it's because they're getting desperate.
[02:06:20.143 --> 02:06:20.223]  800-686-237.
[02:06:20.263 --> 02:06:22.604]  Thank you, Ted.
[02:06:22.805 --> 02:06:23.545]  Yeah, thanks a lot.
[02:06:23.825 --> 02:06:25.966]  All right, there goes Ted Anderson on this for about six, seven minutes.
[02:06:25.986 --> 02:06:27.147]  Let's go back to Jeffrey Grubb.
[02:06:27.187 --> 02:06:34.431]  Jeffrey, please continue with your research of how the real government, the shadow government, works in your book, Corporatism, the Secret Government of the New World.
[02:06:34.611 --> 02:06:38.093]  Order available from ProgressivePress.com.
[02:06:38.113 --> 02:06:39.414]  ProgressivePress.com.
[02:06:39.434 --> 02:06:39.754]  Go ahead.
[02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:45.583]  Okay, and before I end the show, Alex, I've got to read you a Samuel Adams quote about the Second Amendment.
[02:06:45.923 --> 02:06:46.943]  An Al-Qaeda quote?
[02:06:47.083 --> 02:06:48.984]  Oh, you're going to mention a terrorist on my show?
[02:06:49.004 --> 02:06:51.085]  Okay, go ahead, I guess.
[02:06:51.105 --> 02:06:51.806]  Can I read that right now?
[02:06:52.166 --> 02:06:52.966]  Read the terrorist, yes.
[02:06:53.527 --> 02:07:02.671]  Okay, this is specifically in reference to, you know, Obama saying, you know, all these government people saying, you know, you can own a gun, but we just want to restrict it, blah, blah, blah.
[02:07:02.691 --> 02:07:07.494]  You know, they want to put, they want to take control over and certify, you know, it's like a certification, you know.
[02:07:08.018 --> 02:07:12.740]  When you have a certification over something, like organic food or whatever, the government can come in and control it, basically.
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:14.060]  Turns a right into a privilege.
[02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:14.701]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:07:14.861 --> 02:07:15.101]  Yeah.
[02:07:15.441 --> 02:07:16.701]  So here's Samuel Adams.
[02:07:17.142 --> 02:07:20.203]  Among the natural rights of the colonists are these.
[02:07:20.563 --> 02:07:21.543]  First, a right to life.
[02:07:21.723 --> 02:07:23.564]  Second, to flee a life, or to liberty.
[02:07:24.024 --> 02:07:24.985]  Thirdly, to property.
[02:07:25.345 --> 02:07:30.167]  Together, with the right to support and defend them, keyword defend them, in the best manner they can.
[02:07:30.207 --> 02:07:30.467]  Okay?
[02:07:30.807 --> 02:07:32.928]  The key to that quote is the best manner they can.
[02:07:33.516 --> 02:07:47.902]  What that means is, if it's best for us to defend our property and pursuit of happiness with an AR-15, which of course uses .223 most of the time, then that's specifically what we should use, according to this key founding father.
[02:07:48.382 --> 02:07:53.945]  So when somebody like Obama says, oh no, we want to restrict something like .223 ammo, they're breaking the law.
[02:07:54.165 --> 02:07:57.206]  The people should act accordingly to what they're doing.
[02:07:57.839 --> 02:07:59.240]  And basically not cooperate.
[02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:03.662]  We should perform civil disobedience against this administration in every way.
[02:08:04.323 --> 02:08:08.325]  That, which is what I think is the best way to eliminate these people.
[02:08:08.785 --> 02:08:12.087]  But that comes from, I'm reading out of a book called The Second Amendment by David Barton.
[02:08:12.307 --> 02:08:16.409]  That's page 24 and then he's got the site, the reference in there exactly where it isn't.
[02:08:16.569 --> 02:08:17.410]  No, I know that quote.
[02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:18.070]  I know it well.
[02:08:18.490 --> 02:08:21.332]  Your website, by the way, is abstractadam.com.
[02:08:21.832 --> 02:08:22.992]  Abstractadam.com.
[02:08:23.033 --> 02:08:23.653]  Please continue.
[02:08:24.264 --> 02:08:26.066]  Yeah, that website is mostly just my academic work.
[02:08:26.086 --> 02:08:29.749]  There's probably not a whole lot that, um, there's probably not what the listeners are thinking.
[02:08:29.769 --> 02:08:31.230]  It's just basically an academic site.
[02:08:31.850 --> 02:08:36.735]  But I continue on, um, let me tell you another story about what happened at, um, Purdue North Central.
[02:08:36.755 --> 02:08:37.775]  I think you'll really like this one.
[02:08:37.795 --> 02:08:43.240]  This is different than the story of trying to, you know, forgetting to take my gun out of my stuff when I entered the prison that I was teaching at.
[02:08:43.801 --> 02:08:45.362]  Um, but this happened last summer.
[02:08:45.522 --> 02:08:47.844]  I was, uh, teaching ethics class.
[02:08:48.402 --> 02:08:51.064]  And, you know, these ethics classes in college, you know, it's just a lot of fluff.
[02:08:51.084 --> 02:08:54.807]  You can get the concepts over pretty easy, so you've got to fill it in with interesting concepts in the meantime.
[02:08:54.827 --> 02:08:56.888]  So, of course, I'm bringing up the Second Amendment all the time.
[02:08:57.449 --> 02:09:08.116]  But a couple days into the class, we were talking about evolution before that, and I was talking about how it's just a theory, and, you know, really, a lot of the research they say out there that it proves evolution is just a joke.
[02:09:08.156 --> 02:09:11.158]  You know, these four-million-year-old bones, how do we know those are connected to our lineage?
[02:09:11.839 --> 02:09:16.322]  And, you know, they say that there's all this evidence in the junk DNA of the retroviruses
[02:09:16.798 --> 02:09:20.060]  To show that we've got the exact same pattern.
[02:09:20.701 --> 02:09:21.661]  I want to be clear about this.
[02:09:22.242 --> 02:09:27.185]  The way the phony churches have made the debate, I think is unscientific too and not in the Bible.
[02:09:28.406 --> 02:09:31.068]  Claiming things are however many years old.
[02:09:31.308 --> 02:09:32.929]  Clearly, I believe we have an old earth.
[02:09:33.309 --> 02:09:35.110]  The Bible talks about creations before that.
[02:09:35.210 --> 02:09:45.937]  Regardless of that, they try to set all religion or spirituality against science when the science is showing that there is a master builder.
[02:09:45.978 --> 02:09:46.378]  But go ahead.
[02:09:47.219 --> 02:09:48.680]  Yeah, we can go look at a fossil record.
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:51.961]  It seems like there's something, you know, step-by-step going on through the millions of years.
[02:09:51.981 --> 02:09:53.882]  The problem is, it's trying to say that we come from apes.
[02:09:54.142 --> 02:09:55.422]  That's where the evidence is lacking.
[02:09:55.442 --> 02:09:57.003]  Yeah, these are separate arms.
[02:09:57.043 --> 02:09:58.744]  These are separate arms of development.
[02:09:59.024 --> 02:10:04.006]  You know, you don't have a fish turning into a human, or you don't have a chimpanzee turning into a human.
[02:10:04.026 --> 02:10:05.807]  These are separate, divergent.
[02:10:05.827 --> 02:10:11.809]  They have the continual fossil record that doesn't have, you know, these connections.
[02:10:12.089 --> 02:10:14.971]  There's these massive jumps, like overnight.
[02:10:15.011 --> 02:10:15.351]  Go ahead.
[02:10:16.314 --> 02:10:16.894]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:10:16.914 --> 02:10:18.295]  It's called punctuated equilibrium.
[02:10:18.315 --> 02:10:21.496]  This gradual evolution that Darwin put forth doesn't really exist in the fossil record.
[02:10:21.516 --> 02:10:24.557]  That's actually pretty mainstream among biologists and stuff these days.
[02:10:24.937 --> 02:10:34.760]  But anyways, I was trying to, I was discussing that with students, and I was trying to, you know, be empirical as I possibly could, bringing up both sides of the story and saying, you know, I don't really know, and just the evidence for us coming from chimps is not there.
[02:10:34.780 --> 02:10:41.082]  So I had a couple of students just absolutely, I mean, I could just feel their anger from the front of the room.
[02:10:41.122 --> 02:10:45.023]  They were just... You were committing heresy against the eugenicist religion.
[02:10:45.709 --> 02:10:46.490]  Exactly, yeah.
[02:10:46.570 --> 02:10:54.856]  I was basically making it look like humans were not stupid animals, but were actually powerful spiritual creatures by doing that, which goes against that whole eugenics program.
[02:10:55.416 --> 02:11:03.702]  So then the next class, to fill in time, we brought up some controversial issues to illustrate the concepts and philosophical ethics, and those were the Second Amendment, of course.
[02:11:03.722 --> 02:11:05.103]  I'm always itching to bring up the Second Amendment.
[02:11:05.123 --> 02:11:08.926]  It's my favorite thing in the world, besides reading it, is guns.
[02:11:08.966 --> 02:11:14.670]  I mean, just the freedom that carrying a gun gives you, as Thomas Jefferson said, it's just second to none, that feeling.
[02:11:15.060 --> 02:11:18.883]  But anyways, so I started talking.
[02:11:18.903 --> 02:11:20.965]  I had this incredible handout for the students.
[02:11:21.005 --> 02:11:21.966]  I've got it right in front of me here.
[02:11:21.986 --> 02:11:23.247]  It's called A Lesson in the Second Amendment.
[02:11:23.267 --> 02:11:27.751]  Just incredibly well documented, you know, about 100 footnotes and the thing and so forth.
[02:11:28.271 --> 02:11:34.837]  And we were just going through it and all of a sudden, okay, that lasted about, you know, 40 minutes and then we moved on to the next topic in the class.
[02:11:34.857 --> 02:11:36.899]  And then all of a sudden there's a bunch of police outside.
[02:11:37.620 --> 02:11:38.081]  I don't know.
[02:11:48.167 --> 02:11:53.970]  Uh, we got a phone call that you're carrying a gun in your pocket, which of course I wasn't, because I've been too afraid to, of course, carry a gun.
[02:11:53.990 --> 02:11:54.551]  It's a felony.
[02:11:54.591 --> 02:11:55.752]  It's an anti-second amendment.
[02:11:55.792 --> 02:11:58.913]  So just talking about the Second Amendment, police came.
[02:11:58.973 --> 02:12:00.434]  It was a, ahhh!
[02:12:00.674 --> 02:12:12.161]  Well, it turns out, it turns out I found out from other students that that student, Brad, one of the students that was so angry at me for just simply questioning and using empirical evidence to question the theory of monkeys turning into humans,
[02:12:12.679 --> 02:12:18.421]  Through Evolution, one of them called their mother, texted their mother, and said I had a gun in my pocket.
[02:12:19.011 --> 02:12:20.072]  And then the police came.
[02:12:20.392 --> 02:12:22.753]  So it was basically a student did that because they were just so angry.
[02:12:23.973 --> 02:12:36.579]  Well, that's what these fake intellectuals do is they try to shut down free speech by false reports, whatever they can, because it just... I mean, if your information is so powerful and so true, you should want to defend it.
[02:12:36.599 --> 02:12:45.403]  It's kind of like, you know, tens of thousands of people they've grabbed over the years and say they can't have court trials with the Enemy Combatants Act and the Military Commissions Act.
[02:12:45.743 --> 02:12:48.989]  I mean, if these are really terrorists and we've got proof, let's see it!
[02:12:49.711 --> 02:12:51.334]  They always want to do everything they do in secret.
[02:12:51.774 --> 02:12:53.558]  And they don't want to allow any debate.
[02:12:54.419 --> 02:12:58.066]  Well, the whole war on terror and Al-Qaeda and everything...
[02:12:58.487 --> 02:13:01.409]  If people look close, there's no evidence for anything.
[02:13:01.470 --> 02:13:06.814]  I mean, if I see a videotape on TV of Osama Bin Laden, that's, strictly speaking, in the scientific sense, not evidence.
[02:13:07.314 --> 02:13:07.935]  That's nothing.
[02:13:08.635 --> 02:13:13.960]  Well, it's turned out those videos are old videos re-edited, that's been confirmed, and fake videos.
[02:13:14.020 --> 02:13:19.464]  I mean, they've put the classic Morph computer head up, you know, with the one with him in the room.
[02:13:19.484 --> 02:13:21.386]  I mean, they put out admitted fake videos.
[02:13:22.574 --> 02:13:26.156]  Yeah, I mean, the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park sure did look real, I mean, but of course they're fake.
[02:13:26.416 --> 02:13:28.718]  Well, you saw Forrest Gump shake hands with Kennedy.
[02:13:29.679 --> 02:13:30.939]  Exactly, yeah, good one.
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:36.123]  But the, um, the, I forgot what I was going to say.
[02:13:36.143 --> 02:13:37.183]  I'm not good at that.
[02:13:37.624 --> 02:13:41.186]  No, no, no, I mean, you were going through, they came after you for having supposedly a gun.
[02:13:41.206 --> 02:13:41.946]  You didn't have one.
[02:13:41.967 --> 02:13:42.827]  How did that end?
[02:13:42.947 --> 02:13:46.429]  Oh, yeah, we were talking about, yeah, that nothing in the War on Terror is verifiable.
[02:13:46.449 --> 02:13:48.711]  See, but Americans are trained to just believe whatever they want.
[02:13:49.363 --> 02:13:49.843]  You know, not really.
[02:13:49.883 --> 02:13:55.865]  Just go look for evidence that the real, if you really want to get real information about the world, that it's not about the spiritual domain, but about the world.
[02:13:56.165 --> 02:13:57.166]  You need to use your senses.
[02:13:57.206 --> 02:13:58.166]  That's what science is based on.
[02:13:58.186 --> 02:14:03.928]  But people don't know to do that, so then they can put on TV all this stuff about how, you know, there's this boogeyman here and this boogeyman there.
[02:14:03.968 --> 02:14:05.829]  Nobody asks for the verification, for the evidence.
[02:14:05.849 --> 02:14:06.729]  People just believe it.
[02:14:06.749 --> 02:14:12.731]  And then you get this whole apparatus of society, basically everybody telling each other the lie that's out of Orwell.
[02:14:12.751 --> 02:14:14.732]  You know, everybody tells each other the lie and nobody knows the truth.
[02:14:15.205 --> 02:14:21.136]  So you see it on TV, and then you go to work and talk about what was on TV, and you talk about it at church, and you talk about it at... It's a feedback loop.
[02:14:21.918 --> 02:14:25.545]  Yeah, and it's just always lie, lie, lie, lie, and then when somebody comes along and says, oh, hey...
[02:14:26.030 --> 02:14:27.431]  Diet Coke isn't healthy.
[02:14:27.451 --> 02:14:28.171]  It has aspartame.
[02:14:28.212 --> 02:14:29.472]  Everybody says, I can't believe that.
[02:14:29.532 --> 02:14:30.313]  Nobody believes that.
[02:14:30.353 --> 02:14:30.993]  You're crazy.
[02:14:31.193 --> 02:14:31.974]  Everybody drinks it.
[02:14:32.234 --> 02:14:32.975]  It could never be.
[02:14:33.275 --> 02:14:38.959]  And now they've gotten to the point of when we prove mercury's in the food and the shots, they go, OK, mercury's good.
[02:14:38.979 --> 02:14:40.640]  And we prove melamine's in the formula.
[02:14:40.660 --> 02:14:42.861]  And they go, OK, we've always said it's deadly.
[02:14:42.941 --> 02:14:43.602]  It's good for you.
[02:14:43.702 --> 02:14:45.703]  Mercury, melamine, lead, it's all good now.
[02:14:46.504 --> 02:14:48.205]  Yeah, but the denial is just so unbelievable.
[02:14:48.225 --> 02:14:51.407]  Just like that police officer you had on last, an hour or whatever ago.
[02:14:51.823 --> 02:14:52.964]  I've had the same thing happen to me.
[02:14:52.984 --> 02:14:56.265]  When I started listening to you, I got out of stocks, I dumped my house, got into gold.
[02:14:56.345 --> 02:15:03.788]  All the stuff you were saying, and I've even made members of my family tremendous amounts of money, but they'll still say, oh, you were just lucky, or it was just a coincidence.
[02:15:03.868 --> 02:15:07.370]  I'm like, 20 coincidences, or just getting lucky?
[02:15:07.570 --> 02:15:17.735]  Well, that's what they say about all the predictions we make, or what the guests said about oil prices, that for the next year, at least, they were going to drop down to below 50.
[02:15:20.976 --> 02:15:25.660]  Oh, Alex, you guessed they were going to announce a new Bank of the World where we'd pay our carbon taxes.
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:29.143]  Yeah, it's all over the news now, but you guessed that five years ago.
[02:15:30.123 --> 02:15:32.145]  Yeah, that's exactly what people are just saying to me, too.
[02:15:33.446 --> 02:15:34.947]  Oh, well, they like being slaves.
[02:15:35.768 --> 02:15:40.972]  But, you know, I always say, listening to this show is very profitable if you take our advice.
[02:15:41.412 --> 02:15:43.294]  We'll be right back, final segment with our guest.
[02:15:43.954 --> 02:15:44.495]  Stay with us.
[02:15:48.988 --> 02:15:54.650]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[02:15:54.930 --> 02:15:59.711]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[02:15:59.731 --> 02:16:04.933]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[02:16:05.133 --> 02:16:08.574]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[02:16:09.074 --> 02:16:17.241]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[02:16:17.582 --> 02:16:22.966]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[02:16:23.387 --> 02:16:29.132]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:16:29.372 --> 02:16:31.694]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[02:16:32.034 --> 02:16:35.975]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:17:00.663]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:17:01.203 --> 02:17:07.386]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:17:07.686 --> 02:17:09.507]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:17:09.667 --> 02:17:12.048]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:17:12.129 --> 02:17:23.014]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:17:25.302 --> 02:17:26.563]  It's not about left or right.
[02:17:26.963 --> 02:17:28.384]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:17:28.824 --> 02:17:35.188]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:17:35.749 --> 02:17:43.514]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:17:44.014 --> 02:17:45.155]  The Obama Deception.
[02:17:45.575 --> 02:17:46.776]  The people strike back.
[02:17:48.737 --> 02:17:49.277]  You worry.
[02:17:49.637 --> 02:17:51.358]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[02:17:51.718 --> 02:17:53.938]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[02:17:54.358 --> 02:17:56.159]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[02:17:56.479 --> 02:17:57.679]  Your answer may be at hand.
[02:17:58.079 --> 02:18:01.280]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:06.541]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[02:18:06.921 --> 02:18:10.242]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[02:18:10.882 --> 02:18:12.223]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[02:18:12.563 --> 02:18:15.183]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[02:18:15.483 --> 02:18:18.424]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[02:18:18.925 --> 02:18:27.109]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[02:18:27.569 --> 02:18:31.951]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[02:18:32.392 --> 02:18:36.093]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[02:18:36.414 --> 02:18:40.395]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:18:40.415 --> 02:18:41.796]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:18:41.816 --> 02:18:43.537]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[02:18:48.735 --> 02:18:50.477]  Big John.
[02:18:51.598 --> 02:18:54.641]  Big John.
[02:18:54.801 --> 02:18:57.363]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[02:18:57.403 --> 02:18:59.725]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[02:18:59.805 --> 02:19:02.768]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[02:19:02.848 --> 02:19:06.432]  And everybody knew you didn't give no lip to Big John.
[02:19:08.206 --> 02:19:13.228]  Big John, Big John, Big Bad John, Big John
[02:19:19.875 --> 02:19:25.239]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home, he just drifted into town and stayed all alone.
[02:19:25.259 --> 02:19:31.484]  Didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy, but he spoke it all, he just said hi to Big John.
[02:19:31.504 --> 02:19:43.073]  Alright, final five minutes we've got here with the author of Corporatism, The Secret Government of the New World Order, published by the great folks at ProgressivePress.com, put out Webster Tarpley's books that we carry at InfoWars.com.
[02:19:43.113 --> 02:19:46.035]  Don't forget, it's out on DVD, shipping out now, The Obama Deception.
[02:19:46.055 --> 02:19:46.836]  This is the way to have it.
[02:19:47.276 --> 02:19:48.077]  Need to have this film.
[02:19:48.117 --> 02:19:49.178]  Infowars.com.
[02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:51.121]  Spread it out.
[02:19:51.501 --> 02:19:52.502]  Activists take action.
[02:19:52.602 --> 02:19:53.283]  Keep it up.
[02:19:53.343 --> 02:19:55.005]  It's number one video everywhere right now.
[02:19:55.526 --> 02:19:56.127]  Want to commend you.
[02:19:57.760 --> 02:20:10.186]  By the way, in the retransmission starting in about four minutes, Dr. Chuck Baldwin came on about the MIAC report and big breaking news concerning Ron Paul and Bob Barr considering litigation against the state police for this and those that wrote it, and that'll be the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:20:10.226 --> 02:20:11.827]  We need to get on the offensive here.
[02:20:12.427 --> 02:20:19.071]  Commander David K. Rabin, the head of the American Legion, about Obama wanting to basically cut health care, make troops pay for their own health care.
[02:20:20.936 --> 02:20:24.698]  Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers, amazing interview, and of course, Jeff Grubb.
[02:20:24.818 --> 02:20:26.819]  Full circle now here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:20:26.859 --> 02:20:29.281]  Retransmission starts in a few minutes at InfoWars.com.
[02:20:29.661 --> 02:20:31.602]  Okay, you've got about three and a half, four minutes left, sir.
[02:20:31.702 --> 02:20:34.624]  You've got the final word on any other issues you'd like to cover.
[02:20:35.444 --> 02:20:37.545]  Okay, that's great, because I've got something big I want to say.
[02:20:37.825 --> 02:20:41.748]  I've been wanting to crawl into your show for a couple of months to say this.
[02:20:41.848 --> 02:20:43.989]  I think you're out of this, Alex, and probably a lot of listeners are too.
[02:20:44.779 --> 02:20:51.422]  I would just want to say that I think that it's beyond a shadow of a doubt to me that the New World Order is now using our movement to carry out their agenda.
[02:20:51.902 --> 02:21:01.587]  I don't, when I, you know, like I heard Chuck Baldwin in Hour One talking about Rush Limbaugh, he was talking about the Missouri issues and stuff, and all of a sudden Glenn Beckett, our friend, and having Ron Paul all the time.
[02:21:01.607 --> 02:21:07.710]  I mean, I don't, these people have been the most unwavering traitors, all acting in unison,
[02:21:08.134 --> 02:21:08.495]  I don't think so.
[02:21:21.857 --> 02:21:25.458]  So what they're going to do is basically use the movement to carry out their ends.
[02:21:26.519 --> 02:21:31.440]  They're going to try to co-op to get people's confidence, but be specific.
[02:21:31.460 --> 02:21:33.041]  What are you hitting at here?
[02:21:33.221 --> 02:21:35.902]  Well, I think, I mean, look, they're going to try to ban gardening.
[02:21:35.922 --> 02:21:39.463]  I mean, that reminds me of in Robin Hood when they banned, the book Robin Hood, when they banned hunting.
[02:21:39.723 --> 02:21:41.524]  Oh, you're saying they want to cause a revolution.
[02:21:41.724 --> 02:21:43.184]  Yeah, they want riots.
[02:21:43.224 --> 02:21:44.605]  They want to burn this place down.
[02:21:44.765 --> 02:21:47.865]  Oh, I agree with you, but we need to expose that as well.
[02:21:48.585 --> 02:21:49.066]  That's what I mean.
[02:21:49.106 --> 02:21:58.848]  I mean, they're going to put in their own guys for this revolution, and they're going to have their other guys waiting on the other side after they destroy the old world to set up their new world that they want.
[02:21:59.148 --> 02:21:59.908]  I mean, think about it.
[02:22:00.488 --> 02:22:02.428]  They're doing crazy things.
[02:22:02.488 --> 02:22:07.470]  All this foreclosures and inflation and homelessness and gun laws and banning gardening.
[02:22:08.510 --> 02:22:09.490]  People can't pay these taxes.
[02:22:10.251 --> 02:22:11.612]  Driving people into revolution.
[02:22:11.652 --> 02:22:13.513]  I mean they're stepping it up unbelievably.
[02:22:14.014 --> 02:22:17.016]  It just has to be the case they're trying to make everybody go crazy.
[02:22:17.532 --> 02:22:19.734]  And if they're doing that, then it's part of their agenda.
[02:22:19.994 --> 02:22:29.241]  But the ring, as our earlier guest said that they're after, is they want to cause the rebellion, have it be violent, have the military and police against the people.
[02:22:29.581 --> 02:22:32.603]  That's going to backfire, and they are not invincible and can be defeated.
[02:22:32.663 --> 02:22:39.268]  But I agree, they're positioning selves in case they lose, to pose as the patriots, to then take it over.
[02:22:39.328 --> 02:22:41.710]  But we will expose that, and we are exposing that.
[02:22:42.843 --> 02:22:47.666]  Yeah, it should be easy to figure those people out, you know, because like you say, Dutch people are their fruit.
[02:22:48.446 --> 02:22:50.027]  But that's what I think is really going on.
[02:22:50.067 --> 02:22:52.409]  I just don't buy it that all of a sudden Glenn Beck just doesn't about it.
[02:22:52.429 --> 02:22:55.590]  I mean, he was calling us terrorists a year ago, and now all of a sudden he's having Ron Paul on his show.
[02:22:55.710 --> 02:22:57.091]  That's why I went after him.
[02:22:57.111 --> 02:22:58.992]  That's why I went up against him, okay?
[02:22:59.773 --> 02:23:01.894]  I hear you, and I appreciate you joining us, sir.
[02:23:01.954 --> 02:23:03.455]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:23:04.366 --> 02:23:04.866]  Good to have you on.

[02:23:11.609 --> 02:23:13.010]  That was a powerful radio show.

[02:23:13.770 --> 02:23:14.610]  Great job, producers.

[02:23:38.793 --> 02:23:39.374]  Hello, friends.
[02:23:39.414 --> 02:23:40.354]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:23:40.474 --> 02:23:45.097]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:23:45.217 --> 02:23:47.979]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:23:48.179 --> 02:23:51.041]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:23:51.241 --> 02:23:55.944]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:23:56.164 --> 02:23:57.085]  If you simply prepare.
[02:23:57.305 --> 02:24:00.248]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:24:00.548 --> 02:24:07.434]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:24:07.554 --> 02:24:10.657]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
