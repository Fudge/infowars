[00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:02.611]  We are now simulcasting live
[00:00:27.964 --> 00:00:33.885]  At PrisonPlanet.tv for the next hour and 51 minutes that we have left in transmission.
[00:00:33.925 --> 00:00:34.986]  Here's some of the headlines.
[00:00:35.106 --> 00:00:36.666]  Obama loves the Queen!
[00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.007]  This is so disgusting.
[00:00:40.027 --> 00:00:42.967]  I'm going to be covering this coming up in the next hour.
[00:00:45.068 --> 00:00:53.430]  Also, the Israelis' new Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, for the second time back in power, says we may be forced to attack Iran.
[00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.810]  That's out of the Jerusalem Post.
[00:00:55.965 --> 00:00:56.205]  U.S.
[00:00:56.265 --> 00:00:59.847]  private sector access 742,000 jobs in the month of March.
[00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:02.808]  It was 600-something thousand the month before that.
[00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:04.649]  500-something thousand before that.
[00:01:04.669 --> 00:01:06.170]  400-something thousand the month before that.
[00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.671]  These are record job losses.
[00:01:07.691 --> 00:01:08.391]  That's out of Reuters.
[00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:14.314]  Financial rescue nears GDP, gross domestic product, as pledges the top 12.8 trillion.
[00:01:14.594 --> 00:01:20.417]  I know I keep talking about that, but I mean the magnitude of what's happening here is just staggering.
[00:01:22.276 --> 00:01:25.942]  This is approaching more than the whole country even makes of the money that's made.
[00:01:26.182 --> 00:01:28.646]  The entire nation taxes to the bankers.
[00:01:29.167 --> 00:01:35.216]  That's why they're announcing all these new taxes and we're rewriting the tax codes where you can't have exemptions for your house or education or anything else.
[00:01:36.348 --> 00:01:38.731]  I mean, Obama's such a liar.
[00:01:39.011 --> 00:01:43.876]  He said only taxes on people making over $125,000 apiece are totaled $250,000 a year.
[00:01:44.577 --> 00:01:45.318]  It's everybody.
[00:01:45.358 --> 00:01:45.919]  Just get ready.
[00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.624]  Everything you got's going to the bankers, unless you just say, look, you're a pack of criminals, we're arresting you.
[00:01:51.204 --> 00:01:52.426]  But that won't happen, I'm sure.
[00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.448]  Okay, slavery's what you want, then, fine.
[00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:56.590]  Because the world order doesn't exist, right?
[00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.632]  It's just all over the news now.
[00:01:59.192 --> 00:02:03.056]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to play it for Tommy Cryer, attorney at law, and talk about it some with him.
[00:02:03.677 --> 00:02:06.459]  The clip of Sean Hannity, you have that video ready, guys?
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.305]  The clip of Sean Hannity talking about how world government's real, and how the conspiracy people were right.
[00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:16.209]  And they're all admitting we're right now, because see, now it's time to admit the world government.
[00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.254]  And Fox is now going to play the part of those a little bit against it, but maybe we need it.
[00:02:21.564 --> 00:02:24.145]  But then other Murdoch-owned companies, they're saying they're for it in Europe.
[00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:27.625]  And then the CNN and others, they're all for it.
[00:02:27.805 --> 00:02:30.306]  So that's now, are you for the world government or not for it?
[00:02:30.686 --> 00:02:33.607]  They denied it all these years so we couldn't build a resistance against it.
[00:02:34.347 --> 00:02:36.427]  And now Ann Coulter, in fact I forgot that clip.
[00:02:37.147 --> 00:02:39.328]  You can just Google it, I had it at home but I didn't bring it today.
[00:02:40.568 --> 00:02:42.528]  Ann Coulter endorses Ron Paul 2012.
[00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:44.089]  Get that clip ready for later.
[00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:49.096]  So, we'll be going over that.
[00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:50.817]  It's just getting too insane now.
[00:02:51.657 --> 00:02:55.519]  As all these years I'm this dangerous crazy and none of this exists, and now, oh, it's all real!
[00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:56.219]  We love you!
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.221]  We'll tell you what's going on behind that.
[00:03:01.741 --> 00:03:04.442]  And then I've got a free speech issue article here.
[00:03:04.462 --> 00:03:06.103]  This is out of Fox News.
[00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:09.064]  Well, they posted an Associated Press article on Fox News.
[00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:12.646]  Special Olympics launches campaign to ban the word retard.
[00:03:13.772 --> 00:03:15.976]  All that means is retarded.
[00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:17.759]  They have retardation.
[00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:24.891]  You know, that's like the word Negro now has been termed a racial slang.
[00:03:25.431 --> 00:03:26.493]  Anglo-Negro.
[00:03:27.936 --> 00:03:44.492]  In Europe, you get arrested, and this is, you can Google this, this is BBC headlines, they arrested Robin Page, we had him on, the BBC presenter, one man and his dog, where he goes to different towns, hiking each week, and interviews people, and he gave a speech to a rural affairs group and said,
[00:03:45.393 --> 00:03:52.655]  Rural communities have served the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals, and they said, we believe that word was meant to hurt feelings.
[00:03:53.335 --> 00:04:00.036]  The scientific term scares people, heterosexual, homosexual, so we're going to ban that word, and he was arrested, that was in the news.
[00:04:01.117 --> 00:04:06.238]  The BBC agreed with it and said we may have to fire him, this is very evil to say the word homosexual.
[00:04:07.258 --> 00:04:11.079]  Well, because some ignorant people use the term retard to be mean,
[00:04:13.168 --> 00:04:16.071]  Now they want to ban that, but this is only to set the presse first.
[00:04:16.371 --> 00:04:20.655]  You can't deny that six million Jews were killed at Auschwitz alone.
[00:04:21.195 --> 00:04:23.918]  Certainly Hitler was bad, killed a lot of Jews, a lot of other people.
[00:04:23.978 --> 00:04:25.539]  It was in the millions, there's no doubting that.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.583]  But see, the Soviets exaggerated and said six million at Auschwitz.
[00:04:30.364 --> 00:04:33.106]  And then it came out that, well no, not Auschwitz, six million total.
[00:04:33.446 --> 00:04:38.511]  And so that original piece of information is what caused the larger debate.
[00:04:39.858 --> 00:04:44.560]  Well, you say that in most areas of Europe, you get arrested, and I mean, some people serve 20, 30 year sentences.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.401]  They've grabbed Ernst Zundel, they've grabbed a bunch of other people.
[00:04:47.601 --> 00:04:53.263]  And whether you love those people or hate them, they have a right under free speech in any free society to say that.
[00:04:53.283 --> 00:04:58.165]  But we always explain to you, it's going to expand into other things, and it's going to come to the United States.
[00:04:59.145 --> 00:05:02.586]  And once that precedent's set with these hate laws, they can shut everything down.
[00:05:02.606 --> 00:05:07.448]  You know, I have a right to tell some Nazis saying they want to kill black people that that's disgusting and wrong.
[00:05:07.828 --> 00:05:14.451]  I have a right when we've had black Israelites call in, and it's a diverse group, but some of them are flat-out racist and saying I'm a devil man because I'm white.
[00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:16.131]  And I can say you're an idiot racist.
[00:05:17.452 --> 00:05:20.013]  I have my right to counter him and say he's wrong.
[00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.770]  So this is very, very dangerous.
[00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.071]  I want to get into some of that.
[00:05:24.151 --> 00:05:27.012]  Special Olympics launches campaign to ban the word retard.
[00:05:27.852 --> 00:05:39.456]  Associated Press, the Special Olympics launched a campaign Thursday to banish the word retard as a casual insult that derives from an out-of-favor medical term that has long been considered inappropriate.
[00:05:40.516 --> 00:05:49.079]  See, they just make everything homosexual, heterosexual, retarded, retardation.
[00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:50.019]  Can't say it.
[00:05:51.752 --> 00:05:58.237]  People signed pledges not to use the word, and students gathered to denounce its use at rallies from Florida to Alaska.
[00:05:58.577 --> 00:06:06.983]  Over the long term, organizations hope to change attitudes about people with mental disabilities, who number more than 190 million worldwide, according to World Health Organization.
[00:06:07.423 --> 00:06:10.605]  I mean, do you have some punk kids that make fun of mentally retarded children?
[00:06:11.046 --> 00:06:11.626]  Medical term.
[00:06:11.666 --> 00:06:12.827]  Ooh, I said mentally retarded.
[00:06:15.188 --> 00:06:16.149]  Mentally disabled.
[00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.591]  And then, of course, that word won't be acceptable either.
[00:06:20.834 --> 00:06:26.499]  And this is all meant to make you self-censor and think about what you're saying and think about how you're bad when you're not meaning anything mean.
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.842]  This is all part of controlling language.
[00:06:30.222 --> 00:06:37.068]  And now they're saying they want to pass laws in Europe and they're teaching this in public schools that it's wrong to deny climate change, global warming.
[00:06:37.228 --> 00:06:40.851]  They call it climate denial and say it's like holocaust denial.
[00:06:40.871 --> 00:06:43.754]  So see, they say it sounds reasonable.
[00:06:43.774 --> 00:06:44.754]  Let's ban Nazis.
[00:06:46.104 --> 00:06:48.106]  But then they ban your group that isn't Nazi.
[00:06:48.146 --> 00:06:51.449]  See, you have to let the Nazis do what they're doing or you lose your rights.
[00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:54.431]  And this is enshrined in our Republic.
[00:06:54.811 --> 00:06:56.593]  I remember a story in World Net Daily.
[00:06:56.613 --> 00:06:59.395]  It was also in the Idaho mainstream newspapers.
[00:06:59.435 --> 00:07:00.456]  We had the lady on.
[00:07:02.318 --> 00:07:05.361]  And there was a black coach of the football team in front of the whole stadium.
[00:07:07.142 --> 00:07:12.467]  And the husband of the lady who was in the stands who got arrested
[00:07:13.624 --> 00:07:21.163]  He was there taking photos and they lost and the guy blew up and went up and started beating the photographer up.
[00:07:23.922 --> 00:07:26.043]  No, the photographer was the wife, it was the husband in the stands.
[00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:40.088]  He jumps out, and the black guy says, you know, you dumb white person, you dumb, and calls him honky and these other names, and so the guy goes and says the n-word back to him, so I can say honky, but I can't say the other.
[00:07:41.109 --> 00:07:44.090]  And he was arrested, and the police charged him with it.
[00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.331]  So see, this is what's going on, ladies.
[00:07:46.351 --> 00:07:48.532]  He was, by the way, choking the woman, it was on the news.
[00:07:49.112 --> 00:07:51.813]  But you know, it's okay to physically assault somebody, just don't use that term.
[00:07:53.234 --> 00:07:59.235]  So this is the type of stuff we have that's going on here as they move ahead with this.
[00:07:59.255 --> 00:08:04.816]  And of course, they don't say don't take the mercury-filled shots that have caused mental retardation in millions of children.
[00:08:05.116 --> 00:08:05.677]  Don't do that.
[00:08:06.137 --> 00:08:07.217]  Keep giving them the shots.
[00:08:07.297 --> 00:08:09.437]  It's okay to give them HPV shot and they die.
[00:08:09.457 --> 00:08:11.998]  That's okay to kill kids with the vaccines.
[00:08:12.378 --> 00:08:16.939]  Just don't, once we brain damaged them, don't talk about how they're brain damaged.
[00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:21.931]  Instead of Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, it's all these ninnies.
[00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:24.713]  And it's re-education going on in the schools.
[00:08:25.814 --> 00:08:26.575]  Sensitivity training.
[00:08:26.595 --> 00:08:27.355]  It's brainwashing.
[00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:30.758]  It actually makes people have notice of their differences.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.203]  It's like, you know, so many of these other things they do.
[00:08:37.324 --> 00:08:39.706]  Where they tell you, oh, you can't have a Ron Paul sticker, you may be a terrorist.
[00:08:39.726 --> 00:08:41.168]  It's meant to be a chilling effect.
[00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:43.470]  And to always make you think about what you're doing.
[00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.732]  And then they tie it in with white supremacist and things.
[00:08:46.721 --> 00:08:47.922]  This is the tactics they're using.
[00:08:47.982 --> 00:08:58.010]  Okay, without further ado, for the rest of the hour, and we will take some calls later in the hour, Tommy Cryer, throughout the 15th of this month, every day or so, we're going to have guests on.
[00:08:58.351 --> 00:09:04.536]  Joe Bannister, Treasury agent who exposed the IRS was a big scam and they tried to indict him and arrest him and he beat him in court.
[00:09:04.576 --> 00:09:06.277]  I mean, just for speaking out, they did this.
[00:09:06.798 --> 00:09:08.860]  People in prison, like
[00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:21.597]  Well, Mr. Schiff's father, you've got Peter Schiff, and then you've got his father in jail for writing a book about the IRS.
[00:09:22.718 --> 00:09:24.119]  You've got all this stuff happening.
[00:09:24.139 --> 00:09:28.062]  We're going to be covering that here on the show in the next few weeks.
[00:09:28.643 --> 00:09:32.306]  And Tommy Cryer is an attorney at law who successfully defeated the IRS in his own case.
[00:09:32.866 --> 00:09:34.408]  Mr. Cryer, it's great to have you here with us.
[00:09:34.948 --> 00:09:36.429]  Thanks, Alex, for having me on.
[00:09:36.489 --> 00:09:38.031]  I'm always glad to be here.
[00:09:38.898 --> 00:09:42.880]  Just briefly before we go to break, tell folks about yourself, the basics of your case, and what we're dealing with here.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:53.404]  Well, basically what got me involved or tangled up with the IRS was trying to save a friend who had quit filing because he said there was no law making him liable.
[00:09:53.505 --> 00:09:56.486]  And of course, having to file is tied to being liable first.
[00:09:57.686 --> 00:09:59.147]  And I told him it had to be there.
[00:09:59.487 --> 00:10:01.268]  Well, you know the rest of the story on that.
[00:10:02.653 --> 00:10:04.934]  And once I discovered that, I challenged the IRS.
[00:10:05.474 --> 00:10:14.836]  I said, I'll file if and when you can show me you have a right to any of my personal information, and if and when you show me you have a right to any of my personal earnings.
[00:10:15.937 --> 00:10:20.098]  And they still haven't been able to show me any of that, but what they decided to do was indict me.
[00:10:21.098 --> 00:10:25.039]  They said, well, we don't have any right, but we've got might, and we're going to show you our muscle.
[00:10:27.139 --> 00:10:29.140]  And in this one instance,
[00:10:30.041 --> 00:10:32.462]  I want to break down what the IRS really is.
[00:10:32.482 --> 00:10:33.863]  We didn't have this thing until 1913.
[00:10:35.283 --> 00:10:36.584]  And we built our country without it.
[00:10:58.007 --> 00:11:05.472]  And now it openly works for foreign banks that have stolen 12.8 trillion from the American people in less than six months.
[00:11:05.992 --> 00:11:06.172]  Yeah.
[00:11:07.253 --> 00:11:14.898]  And that's before you start applying any fractional, you know, reserve impact.
[00:11:15.699 --> 00:11:17.780]  Now, you know, that's a lot of water in the soup pot.
[00:11:20.062 --> 00:11:26.546]  And so what does that do to working American families whose money is being watered down?
[00:11:27.268 --> 00:11:29.991]  And they're having trouble making ends meet as it is.
[00:11:30.851 --> 00:11:35.836]  And then you throw all of that extra water in the pot and then say, now try to make a living off of this watery soup.
[00:11:35.856 --> 00:11:38.538]  Yeah, we're going to talk about your IRS case.
[00:11:38.658 --> 00:11:42.902]  What's, you know, the fight to expose these collection agency for the private fellow reserve.
[00:11:43.022 --> 00:11:44.864]  That's who you write your check to, the private fed.
[00:11:44.944 --> 00:11:45.744]  It's so sick.
[00:11:46.425 --> 00:11:48.707]  Only the gullible people would buy this.
[00:11:49.268 --> 00:11:50.469]  But folks are starting to wake up.
[00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:51.810]  Tommy Cryer, stay there, my friend.

[00:12:51.308 --> 00:13:00.312]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:13:00.882 --> 00:13:07.925]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:13:08.445 --> 00:13:14.628]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:16.869]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:19.430]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:30.415]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:13:31.084 --> 00:13:32.385]  It's not about left or right.
[00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:34.146]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:40.950]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:13:41.531 --> 00:13:49.316]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:50.957]  The Obama Deception.
[00:13:51.357 --> 00:13:52.558]  The people strike back.
[00:13:54.344 --> 00:14:00.567]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:14:01.027 --> 00:14:08.790]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:14.713]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[00:14:15.054 --> 00:14:16.995]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:14:17.295 --> 00:14:22.056]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:14:22.396 --> 00:14:27.098]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:14:27.618 --> 00:14:31.459]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:14:31.959 --> 00:14:32.979]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:37.121]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[00:14:54.449 --> 00:14:58.051]  Do you have trouble sleeping due to sensations in your legs?
[00:14:58.491 --> 00:14:59.872]  You are not alone.
[00:15:00.412 --> 00:15:02.914]  Millions of Americans suffer from restless legs.
[00:15:03.274 --> 00:15:08.017]  Restless legs is a condition caused by the uncontrollable urge to move your legs.
[00:15:08.337 --> 00:15:10.058]  Signs include itching, pulling,
[00:15:10.418 --> 00:15:11.239]  We're good to go!

[00:15:54.643 --> 00:16:06.950]  You know, we've been having a lot of false attacks and just the most outrageous lies you can imagine made up about us lately.
[00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:12.353]  The people are getting so upset by our success and it's given us record internet audience.
[00:16:12.753 --> 00:16:14.574]  We're hitting records we've never hit before.
[00:16:15.135 --> 00:16:19.917]  So I guess all weapons formed against us will be turned into blessings as they say.
[00:16:19.937 --> 00:16:22.359]  Haha!
[00:16:24.099 --> 00:16:26.621]  Come on, come on, come on, baby!
[00:16:26.761 --> 00:16:29.003]  Come on, come on, come on!
[00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:32.867]  I got you in a stranglehold, baby!
[00:16:35.899 --> 00:16:36.939]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.800]  A huge news blitz next hour.
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.041]  I'm going to go through it all.
[00:16:40.841 --> 00:16:53.187]  Next segment I'm going to play some short clips of Sean Hannity and others admitting world government is real, world takeover, that we the Kooks were right, because we can read documents, public documents, and study history.
[00:16:54.087 --> 00:16:56.569]  We got Ann Coulter saying Ron Paul was right.
[00:16:57.889 --> 00:16:59.370]  Just amazing stuff coming up.
[00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.051]  Tommy Cryer, just recap your case.
[00:17:02.091 --> 00:17:03.792]  You beat him, it made him hopping mad.
[00:17:04.492 --> 00:17:09.534]  We've got Larry Becraft and other serious constitutional lawyers like yourself who's been beating him successful.
[00:17:09.554 --> 00:17:26.801]  And the reason I like to have you on in this whole series of interviews we're doing, perhaps I'll have you on with Joe Bannister or something at the same time in the next few weeks when they're on, is that there's all these conspiracy kooks, who really are conspiracy kooks, who discredit us, who tell people all these lies and trust and get people put in prison.
[00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:32.903]  So, we don't want to tell people, this is like the Mafia, this is a big decision to decide to go up against these people.
[00:17:32.963 --> 00:17:37.805]  It's not a battle I've chosen, but I commend those that have the courage like yourself to do that.
[00:17:38.985 --> 00:17:49.769]  Jesse, before somebody does decide to go one-on-one, see, Truth Attack, the organization I formed to fight this beast and to do it in, is a coalition.
[00:17:49.829 --> 00:17:54.731]  It's not just a group of people, it's a coalition of a lot of organizations working together hand-in-hand now.
[00:17:55.433 --> 00:18:01.178]  That's what we need to do is to consolidate the movement instead of fighting against and with each other.
[00:18:02.059 --> 00:18:10.726]  And it offers a lot of things that people can do that actually does more damage to the beast than beating him in court.
[00:18:11.367 --> 00:18:19.954]  But if they do want to go one-on-one with the beast, they need to first go to TruthAttack.org and take the pre-induction physical there.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.281]  It tells them, make sure you're fit for singular combat with this monster.
[00:18:24.421 --> 00:18:27.601]  It's the most powerful and dangerous organization in the world.
[00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:30.562]  And there are two sides of it that it can't defend.
[00:18:31.322 --> 00:18:32.262]  The lies and the myths.
[00:18:33.322 --> 00:18:37.663]  And, you know, if you want to fight the lies and the myths, you can do that without having to put your neck on the block.
[00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:46.085]  Now, we need people like Larry McGrath out there, and we need people that are out there willing to stand up and do battle.
[00:18:46.644 --> 00:19:06.669]  But we also need a lot of people out there fighting and chopping away at the lies and myths that the Internal Revenue Service uses to scam, intimidate, coerce, or just out and out take by force, you know, the money and the property of people that aren't even liable for the income tax to begin with.
[00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:15.612]  Well, here's two examples I want you to speak to in your case specifically, and we're going to get into a bunch of other issues with Tommy Cryer, our guest, attorney at law, and it's this.
[00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:19.091]  Here's an example.
[00:19:19.151 --> 00:19:23.337]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:19:23.357 --> 00:19:25.039]  And then it goes on to the press or to the symbol.
[00:19:26.038 --> 00:19:33.520]  But the government's regulating all the major religious institutions, and if they don't go get a license from them, they're taxed, but you can make no law.
[00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:35.121]  So they're breaking the law there.
[00:19:35.141 --> 00:19:36.101]  Well, same thing with the IRS.
[00:19:36.421 --> 00:19:45.504]  When they make you fill out those IRS forms under threat of arrest, they're compelling you to violate your own Fifth Amendment to self-incrimination.
[00:19:45.524 --> 00:19:50.726]  I mean, this is... And your Fourth Amendment right to be private in your effects and your personal information.
[00:19:53.467 --> 00:19:54.407]  So speak to that, sir.
[00:19:55.305 --> 00:20:04.387]  Basically, what they've done is they've used a text that is intended to cover foreign commerce.
[00:20:05.067 --> 00:20:09.729]  In other words, non-resident aliens and foreign corporations doing business in the United States.
[00:20:10.289 --> 00:20:19.491]  And they have tricked, through the use of clever language and very clever drafting, it gives impressions.
[00:20:19.531 --> 00:20:22.272]  You have to put two parts together to understand it.
[00:20:22.412 --> 00:20:23.572]  They usually separate them.
[00:20:24.121 --> 00:20:24.502]  I think so, yeah.
[00:20:41.153 --> 00:20:41.794]  I love that!
[00:20:41.854 --> 00:20:42.814]  It's a rule of law.
[00:20:43.254 --> 00:20:49.458]  You're right, under the IRS system, they've now set up family courts that are outside the Constitution, no due process, don't have juries.
[00:20:49.978 --> 00:20:56.302]  They've set up all these other new environmental courts so Monsanto can poison things, but it's their own federal court that isn't exactly.
[00:20:57.263 --> 00:21:05.628]  They're converting the whole system from liberty to tyranny, from due process to Napoleonic law, through the envelope of the IRS fraud.
[00:21:06.088 --> 00:21:07.049]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:07.409 --> 00:21:08.810]  And they're using the network
[00:21:09.489 --> 00:21:10.712]  We're good to go.
[00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.431]  Of every one of our activities.
[00:21:23.031 --> 00:21:24.772]  Particularly our financial activities.
[00:21:24.812 --> 00:21:25.492]  Alright, stay there.
[00:21:25.532 --> 00:21:28.354]  We're going to... Tommy, long segment coming up.
[00:21:28.374 --> 00:21:29.854]  Plenty of time for you to get into detail here.
[00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:32.636]  I want to break down the facts you're laying on people.
[00:21:32.676 --> 00:21:33.756]  Each one of them a bombshell.
[00:21:33.776 --> 00:21:34.577]  These are documented.
[00:21:34.617 --> 00:21:40.679]  Then we're going to play these Ann Coulter clips and the Fox News clips where they love Ron Paul and they want to fight the New World Order.
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:41.660]  Yeah, right.
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.821]  And Glenn Beck's going to debunk the FEMA camps next Monday.
[00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:45.922]  We're on the march.
[00:21:46.382 --> 00:21:47.883]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:48.912 --> 00:21:51.676]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:54.901 --> 00:21:56.083]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[00:21:56.263 --> 00:22:02.693]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food, but Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[00:22:02.833 --> 00:22:04.616]  If you're a politician who voted for the bail
[00:22:09.577 --> 00:22:18.764]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[00:22:18.985 --> 00:22:25.130]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.773]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:33.177]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[00:22:33.377 --> 00:22:34.818]  For the rest of you, go to eFoods.com.
[00:22:40.742 --> 00:22:43.623]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:01.375 --> 00:23:06.718]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:23:07.259 --> 00:23:13.442]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:23:13.743 --> 00:23:15.564]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:23:15.724 --> 00:23:18.105]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:23:18.185 --> 00:23:29.072]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.621]  It's not about left or right.
[00:23:33.021 --> 00:23:34.442]  It's about a one world government.
[00:23:34.882 --> 00:23:41.185]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:23:41.805 --> 00:23:49.589]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:23:50.049 --> 00:23:51.210]  The Obama Deception.
[00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:52.831]  The people strike back.
[00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:59.052]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:23:59.312 --> 00:24:04.213]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:24:04.413 --> 00:24:05.734]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:24:05.914 --> 00:24:09.395]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:25:14.594 --> 00:25:16.556]  No, I've played some of these clips, but not all of them.
[00:25:16.576 --> 00:25:17.598]  I want to play three clips.
[00:25:17.638 --> 00:25:23.524]  Michael Savage saying he believes Obama will stage a massive terror attack on the United States and bring in martial law.
[00:25:24.165 --> 00:25:25.186]  Absolutely accurate.
[00:25:25.787 --> 00:25:27.008]  Suddenly he's saying we're right.
[00:25:27.709 --> 00:25:30.733]  Fox News saying they're setting up global government, global currency.
[00:25:32.054 --> 00:25:33.954]  Sean Hannity, unbelievable.
[00:25:34.875 --> 00:25:37.695]  We got Ann Coulter endorsing Ron Paul for 2012 as president.
[00:25:38.075 --> 00:25:39.016]  What is going on here?
[00:25:39.036 --> 00:25:40.376]  We're going to cover that a little bit later.
[00:25:41.116 --> 00:25:44.397]  So call everybody you know, tell them to tune in on the local AM or FM affiliate you're listening to.

[00:25:49.038 --> 00:25:49.878]  I want folks to hear this.
[00:25:50.198 --> 00:25:53.499]  Call your mainline neocon friends that tell you you're a kook right now.
[00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:57.181]  Tell them to tune in, go to Infowars.com, click on there.
[00:25:57.221 --> 00:25:58.582]  No matter where they are, they've got internet.
[00:25:58.802 --> 00:26:00.523]  They can listen on their cell phone at Flycast.
[00:26:01.144 --> 00:26:02.965]  And tell them, I mean, they need to see this.
[00:26:03.025 --> 00:26:03.846]  This is everywhere.
[00:26:04.126 --> 00:26:05.507]  Why have they suddenly admitted we're right?
[00:26:06.487 --> 00:26:07.068]  That's coming up.
[00:26:07.148 --> 00:26:10.310]  Okay, Tommy Cryer, attorney at law, beat the IRS.
[00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:14.053]  In a nutshell, boil down how you beat them with the jury.
[00:26:14.093 --> 00:26:15.294]  That's why they want to phase those out.
[00:26:15.954 --> 00:26:20.217]  How they drag other people into these fake IRS courts and try to get them to plea bargain without ever seeing a jury.
[00:26:20.918 --> 00:26:22.419]  And some of the basic scams they run.
[00:26:24.398 --> 00:26:25.058]  I don't know.
[00:26:25.159 --> 00:26:26.899]  I don't know.
[00:26:53.301 --> 00:27:00.546]  I was under a legal duty to file tax returns, and that eliminated willfulness on my part.
[00:27:01.607 --> 00:27:04.149]  Now, they didn't have to decide whether I owed a tax or not.
[00:27:04.189 --> 00:27:08.292]  They didn't have to decide whether I was required to file a return, but they were astute enough.
[00:27:08.672 --> 00:27:20.101]  It's hard to find a jury like that, but I was able, apparently, to articulate what I had discovered, and they could see where that was my genuine belief.
[00:27:20.141 --> 00:27:21.982]  It's very difficult to convince a jury.
[00:27:22.757 --> 00:27:26.379]  That you believe that the earth is round when everybody knows that it's flat.
[00:27:27.099 --> 00:27:31.502]  Now, what did the prosecutors do when they were defeated?
[00:27:31.522 --> 00:27:34.123]  Did it look like they'd been hit in the stomach with a baseball bat?
[00:27:34.543 --> 00:27:40.906]  Well, everybody, they had a whole bunch of guys from the IRS in the courtroom to hear the verdict, and they just vanished.
[00:27:40.926 --> 00:27:42.127]  They evaporated.
[00:27:42.367 --> 00:27:43.368]  Nobody even saw them go out.
[00:27:43.388 --> 00:27:44.288]  They went out so fast.
[00:27:45.249 --> 00:27:46.229]  But the prosecutor did.
[00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:48.210]  I walked over, and we shook hands.
[00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:49.811]  He was doing his job.
[00:27:50.271 --> 00:27:51.692]  He was working for his master.
[00:27:52.601 --> 00:27:53.942]  I don't think so.
[00:28:03.411 --> 00:28:06.693]  And I'm sure that this count is a feather in his cap.
[00:28:07.114 --> 00:28:08.535]  Now let's talk about Joe Bannister.
[00:28:08.575 --> 00:28:09.636]  This is a treasury agent.
[00:28:09.656 --> 00:28:10.116]  Here's D.B.
[00:28:10.156 --> 00:28:15.780]  Kidd on a mainstream radio show in the Bay Area of Central California, San Francisco.
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.982]  He pulls over, writes notes for an hour.
[00:28:19.022 --> 00:28:20.043]  He's going to disprove her.
[00:28:20.083 --> 00:28:24.026]  He's going to show she's a criminal, lying about it being a collection agency for the private bank.
[00:28:24.426 --> 00:28:25.807]  He does two years of research.
[00:28:25.847 --> 00:28:27.708]  Recapping, we flew out there to interview him first.
[00:28:28.029 --> 00:28:28.589]  We're proud of that.
[00:28:29.289 --> 00:28:32.370]  He and I are so parallel, Alex, it's not even funny.
[00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:35.310]  Both of us were setting out to debunk this.
[00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:39.351]  Both of us spent two years pouring into it to find out why.
[00:28:39.371 --> 00:28:52.994]  It didn't take long to see that there was no liability provision, but it takes a long time to dig all the way back to the 13th century and all the way back forward, study all the constitutional issues and authorities, and understand why and how they did it.
[00:28:53.752 --> 00:29:00.697]  But the issue is, he was still even paying taxes for years as he went around the country exposing him, because he knew how criminal they were.
[00:29:01.018 --> 00:29:08.724]  So they still indicted him for teaching people this, just like they did with Mr. Schiff, Erwin Schiff.
[00:29:09.424 --> 00:29:11.065]  So, I mean, it's just amazing.
[00:29:11.125 --> 00:29:13.047]  That's another example of their tyranny.
[00:29:13.067 --> 00:29:18.071]  Another example, like for example, I was listening in before you introduced me.
[00:29:18.624 --> 00:29:30.810]  And you referred to the Holocaust denial, and they put people in prison for just saying there weren't six million, there were maybe five million, or there were maybe four million, and they're putting people in prison for saying that, hey, what about the head count?
[00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:33.952]  Maybe the head count was wrong, as if that's injuring somebody.
[00:29:35.473 --> 00:29:36.453]  It's the same thing here.
[00:29:36.553 --> 00:29:42.816]  If you tell the truth, they're going to lock you away, or now their favorite is what they call 6,700 abusive tax shelters.
[00:29:46.775 --> 00:29:48.336]  That there's no law that makes them liable.
[00:29:48.376 --> 00:30:00.220]  If you tell people that there is no basis for their treating your gross receipts in exchange for your labor any differently from Exxon's gross receipts, they don't tax them on 100% of what they take in.
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.561]  How do they tax you on 100%?
[00:30:02.881 --> 00:30:04.622]  So, it's only the profit, right?
[00:30:05.502 --> 00:30:11.825]  So, if you deny that, then they come in and say, that's an abusive tax shelter just for telling people the truth.
[00:30:14.312 --> 00:30:17.293]  They put a gag order against you.
[00:30:17.493 --> 00:30:18.594]  Now is that First Amendment?
[00:30:18.674 --> 00:30:20.075]  I mean, do we have freedom of speech here?
[00:30:20.475 --> 00:30:21.936]  The point that you made was dead on.
[00:30:21.976 --> 00:30:22.976]  The point you made was dead on.
[00:30:22.996 --> 00:30:23.556]  We have one.
[00:30:23.576 --> 00:30:23.957]  Where's he go?
[00:30:40.487 --> 00:30:42.369]  All of this, you mentioned too, the 1913.
[00:30:43.209 --> 00:30:46.632]  1913, this isn't just about the income tax.
[00:30:47.172 --> 00:30:55.319]  The income tax of 1913, 16th Amendment, 17th Amendment, cutting the arms off of all the states.
[00:30:55.959 --> 00:31:01.263]  You know, kicking them out of where they had no representation in Congress anymore.
[00:31:01.284 --> 00:31:04.126]  And, above all, the Federal Reserve Act.
[00:31:04.986 --> 00:31:06.848]  Everything works hand in glove.
[00:31:07.386 --> 00:31:08.007]  We're good to go.
[00:31:17.563 --> 00:31:22.766]  And by the way, the ultra-rich are now even robbing the nouveau riche while leaving their big Swiss accounts alone.
[00:31:23.066 --> 00:31:30.250]  The ultra-elite literally are just robbing everyone, including the middle class, the upper middle class, so no one can resist them.
[00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:35.492]  They're using the tyranny of poverty as a control mechanism in the UN Club of Rome.
[00:31:35.892 --> 00:31:38.414]  They all brag that's their system, shifting gears into the...
[00:31:38.954 --> 00:31:51.457]  Those that control the private IRS here and over in England, I mean, they're openly announcing world government saying all our money is going to be paid on interest to private banks for bailing them out.
[00:31:51.557 --> 00:31:52.318]  You think it's bad?
[00:31:53.718 --> 00:32:07.002]  Bailing out is, and I'm not taking away from the sexual on this particular analogy, but what we are witnessing in front of God and everybody is a huge
[00:32:08.817 --> 00:32:20.065]  It's a financial orgasm that is culminating from the consummation of an unholy and incestuous marriage of big money and big government.
[00:32:20.645 --> 00:32:21.926]  And that's what you're seeing right now.
[00:32:21.986 --> 00:32:28.471]  You're witnessing the consummation of this marriage that's been in the works for the last almost 100 years.
[00:32:29.315 --> 00:32:30.235]  Yeah, they're butchering us.
[00:32:30.275 --> 00:32:39.918]  They're just stealing everything forever, bankrupting it, and then hoarding it all, while saying, quote, headline, uh, you know, world leaders are desperate to fix things.
[00:32:39.938 --> 00:32:40.598]  World leaders.
[00:32:40.858 --> 00:32:43.099]  You found the exact headline, uh, here.
[00:32:43.119 --> 00:32:45.980]  Well, we're trying to do something about that.
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:51.981]  And, uh, if I can mention that we've got Operation Stop Thieves scheduled for, uh, this April 15th.
[00:32:52.522 --> 00:32:57.023]  Already, we have Stop Thieves, uh, groups registered on TruthDetect.org.
[00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:58.471]  We're good to go.
[00:33:19.326 --> 00:33:20.287]  Well, that's a good analogy.
[00:33:20.327 --> 00:33:27.472]  Well, the elites see them as cattle, so we're there trying to feed them red pills so they go from being cattle back to human beings.
[00:33:27.492 --> 00:33:28.332]  Now, here it is.
[00:33:28.693 --> 00:33:31.715]  Desperate world leaders meet on Economic Woes AP.
[00:33:32.355 --> 00:33:41.782]  Desperate but divided on ways to lift their nations from economic misery, world leaders converge for an emergency summit Tuesday, holding scant hopes of finding a magic bullet solution.
[00:33:41.802 --> 00:33:47.746]  See, they say it's only going to get worse, but their solution, when you read further, is a world government ruled by the banks that you pay your
[00:33:48.146 --> 00:33:50.567]  Carbon taxes too, Tommy Cryer.
[00:33:50.767 --> 00:33:52.488]  Their solution is more problem.
[00:33:53.329 --> 00:33:54.650]  You know, the problem is the government.
[00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:56.851]  And so they want to have more problem.
[00:33:56.891 --> 00:33:59.812]  It's kind of like when they were bleeding George Washington.
[00:33:59.852 --> 00:34:02.414]  You know, we bled him three times and he just keeps getting weaker.
[00:34:02.434 --> 00:34:03.294]  Let's bleed him again.
[00:34:05.075 --> 00:34:07.076]  And he died.
[00:34:09.698 --> 00:34:11.018]  You know, that's what's going to happen to us.
[00:34:11.619 --> 00:34:12.959]  Our way of life is going to die.
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:17.602]  You know, our freedom is already withered on the branch and it's falling off.
[00:34:18.246 --> 00:34:40.923]  You know, I'm in a state of angst over this, and I have never seen American people more angst ridden, more anxious, more dreading or fearful than they were, and I don't know if you recall this or not, but the Cuban Missile Crisis is the last time I've seen people this frightened, this concerned.
[00:34:41.923 --> 00:34:48.568]  Well, they better be, because the elite terrorized people, said the markets were in trouble, said we were going to have a depression.
[00:34:48.948 --> 00:34:49.809]  Everything plunged.
[00:34:50.229 --> 00:34:58.255]  They got unlimited money, and then they hoard it, and then cut off liquidity on cars, loans, homes, everything by design.
[00:34:58.275 --> 00:35:04.080]  And it's even coming out in the major press that they're making money off this, that this is their consolidation.
[00:35:04.963 --> 00:35:09.867]  Well, not only that, but they're cutting what our little take is on the share crop.
[00:35:10.367 --> 00:35:12.469]  They're share cropping us, but they're cutting our share.
[00:35:12.929 --> 00:35:19.834]  And the way they do it is, when I started working, Alex, the minimum wage was $1.60 an hour.
[00:35:20.655 --> 00:35:24.918]  Now, back then, that $1.60 was backed up with silver still.
[00:35:25.798 --> 00:35:29.181]  However, right now, people's minimum wage is $0.21 an hour.
[00:35:32.458 --> 00:35:36.900]  People think it's 5 something, but an FRN is only worth about 4 cents.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:40.681]  They're working for 21 cents an hour, as opposed to $1.60 40 years ago. $1.60.
[00:35:59.938 --> 00:36:01.318]  Yeah, about now.
[00:36:01.739 --> 00:36:05.320]  If you multiply it, the factor is 20 to 1.
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:10.961]  So actually, back then I was making the equivalent today on minimum wage.
[00:36:11.702 --> 00:36:13.322]  I was making the equivalent today of 1.6 times 20.
[00:36:13.382 --> 00:36:14.302]  So you're making 30 bucks?
[00:36:15.123 --> 00:36:17.163]  I'm making 32 bucks an hour.
[00:36:20.285 --> 00:36:22.367]  Okay, $32 an hour.
[00:36:22.427 --> 00:36:25.670]  That's what inflation, so we've had this gradual inflation that was bad enough.
[00:36:26.091 --> 00:36:30.235]  We've really had no inflation, Alex, because I've got a silver dollar in my pocket.
[00:36:30.275 --> 00:36:31.496]  It was minted in 1923.
[00:36:32.336 --> 00:36:36.160]  I've carried it in my pocket slick as a whistle, because I've carried it for 50 years.
[00:36:36.921 --> 00:36:40.985]  But, in 1923, the day it was minted, it would have bought 10 loaves of bread.
[00:36:41.545 --> 00:36:45.449]  Right now, you could take that same silver dollar and probably buy 15 loaves of bread.
[00:36:46.604 --> 00:36:47.964]  No, exactly what I said.
[00:36:48.124 --> 00:36:49.005]  Inflation, I meant.
[00:36:49.285 --> 00:36:51.225]  The Federal Reserve, Private Banking Union.
[00:36:51.305 --> 00:36:57.986]  I understand what you mean, but if we would take a look at the dollar, a dollar is still, by a dollar's worth, at least.
[00:36:59.087 --> 00:37:01.347]  And, you know, what we're looking at is play money.
[00:37:01.967 --> 00:37:04.168]  You can't inflate money that has no value.
[00:37:04.948 --> 00:37:06.108]  All you can do is dilute it.
[00:37:07.408 --> 00:37:08.289]  And that's what we're seeing.
[00:37:08.469 --> 00:37:14.590]  They keep pouring water in the soup pot, water in the soup pot, and now you can see the bottom of the pot, and they're saying live off of that.
[00:37:16.354 --> 00:37:21.918]  We're like slaves that have been given out our rations, and the rations keep having more water and less soup.
[00:37:23.239 --> 00:37:32.967]  Well, no, that's true, but the bankers up front, when they're first devaluing, they buy real assets with the money they create out of nothing, and then now they're even trying to reduce the amount of reduced soup we get.
[00:37:34.088 --> 00:37:43.595]  And that same power that you're talking about, just acquired by taking over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, just acquired mortgages over half of America's households.
[00:37:46.324 --> 00:37:48.144]  Is it just me, or is this scary?
[00:37:48.564 --> 00:37:52.465]  Well, did you see Obama seize, basically, General Motors?
[00:37:52.485 --> 00:37:53.826]  He fired the director.
[00:37:53.846 --> 00:37:55.346]  He said, you get out of there.
[00:37:55.366 --> 00:37:56.246]  You didn't do what I want.
[00:37:56.566 --> 00:38:01.228]  And now he's going to have that go under government and private banking control that controls him.
[00:38:01.988 --> 00:38:05.149]  And he's saying they may start seizing other companies, not just banks.
[00:38:05.229 --> 00:38:12.291]  So, this is openly with the government acting as the thug for the bankers to just come out and grab everything.
[00:38:12.751 --> 00:38:33.500]  Exactly, and what we're going from, we've seen the transition of fascism with this unholy marriage of big business and big government, but now big government is starting to eat its partner, because the real master over these two is the Federal Reserve, and the bankers behind it.
[00:38:34.011 --> 00:38:35.271]  And the bankers are offshore.
[00:38:35.611 --> 00:38:37.872]  They don't care if they destroy Europe and the United States.
[00:38:38.192 --> 00:38:39.052]  That gives them the power.
[00:38:39.072 --> 00:38:43.013]  They're looking at their world assets, the assets, the hard assets you were talking about.
[00:38:43.854 --> 00:38:47.535]  You couldn't be more correct in your analysis, Alex.
[00:38:47.575 --> 00:38:50.535]  They go out and they're not dealing in dollars that devalue.
[00:38:50.575 --> 00:38:52.716]  They're dealing in real assets that have value.
[00:38:54.456 --> 00:38:58.637]  And yet we're out here playing with this monopoly money and saying, ain't we rich?
[00:38:59.078 --> 00:38:59.918]  We'll print us some more.
[00:38:59.998 --> 00:39:00.758]  You know, we'll get richer.
[00:39:01.497 --> 00:39:02.037]  Exactly.
[00:39:02.558 --> 00:39:07.681]  And they're passing the more property taxes and franchise taxes and business taxes right here in Texas.
[00:39:08.382 --> 00:39:22.631]  And the businesses are all going out of business and the globalists openly write white papers saying we want a post-industrial world where you're all poor people living in shacks and they live off on armored mountains with all the high technology and the high tech health care and everything.
[00:39:22.671 --> 00:39:26.454]  This is a tool of military financial conquest.
[00:39:26.754 --> 00:39:29.256]  They want to hurt you in their own documents.
[00:39:29.516 --> 00:39:31.017]  And that's what the public has to get.
[00:39:31.037 --> 00:39:31.297]  Go ahead.
[00:39:31.577 --> 00:39:32.217]  Absolutely.
[00:39:32.257 --> 00:39:46.985]  A couple of weeks ago, Truth In Tech issued a demand that they adopt a true stimulus plan to re-energize the economy by suspending the withholding collection of the personal income tax.
[00:39:47.386 --> 00:39:48.526]  Like corporate, just personal.
[00:39:49.127 --> 00:39:54.950]  Start allowing some of the rest of the money earned by the households to go into those households.
[00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:59.132]  It would save a lot of these foreclosures that are going on in the first place.
[00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:08.939]  But because people are unable to buy goods, other people are going out of business or out of losing their jobs, and then they can't buy goods, and they can't pay for their homes.
[00:40:08.959 --> 00:40:10.960]  You've got more foreclosures, more layoffs.
[00:40:11.661 --> 00:40:14.884]  Well, you can reverse that trend real easy just by allowing people to keep their money.
[00:40:16.846 --> 00:40:20.729]  All these households, all of these boom, and then what happens whenever you've got the 30%?
[00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:25.454]  Is it being raked off the top of every state's gross domestic product every week?
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:26.681]  I don't know.
[00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:36.071]  The local revenues go up.
[00:40:36.111 --> 00:40:39.272]  They don't need to borrow and beg money from the federal government.
[00:40:39.292 --> 00:40:43.013]  The federal revenues go up on the other 80 taxes that they have.
[00:40:43.414 --> 00:40:45.334]  But is that press release getting any coverage?
[00:40:45.354 --> 00:40:45.935]  Not one.
[00:40:45.955 --> 00:40:46.455]  Not one picked it up.
[00:40:46.475 --> 00:40:47.635]  They've proved it too many times.
[00:40:47.655 --> 00:40:48.055]  Kennedy proved it.
[00:40:48.095 --> 00:40:48.576]  Didn't turn around.
[00:40:49.016 --> 00:40:50.056]  Reagan did the same thing.
[00:40:50.076 --> 00:40:50.456]  He proved it.
[00:41:02.934 --> 00:41:09.437]  Or to a lesser extent, George Bush I, with his lesser extent tax cut, proved it.
[00:41:09.677 --> 00:41:10.557]  Revenues go up.
[00:41:10.957 --> 00:41:13.658]  But let me just keep backing you up here, because it's all true.
[00:41:14.499 --> 00:41:15.359]  It's about control.
[00:41:15.399 --> 00:41:16.099]  It isn't revenues.
[00:41:16.119 --> 00:41:17.320]  This is all fiat to them.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.461]  It's done to bring in control, as you just said.
[00:41:21.501 --> 00:41:25.303]  But did you see the Wall Street Journal and all these articles analyzing what Obama said he's going to do?
[00:41:26.505 --> 00:41:35.832]  I'm sure you've heard this though, that he's gutting the tax code to get rid of home exemptions, education exemptions, a tax raise on everybody.
[00:41:37.113 --> 00:41:39.374]  Well, that I've heard about.
[00:41:39.394 --> 00:41:41.136]  And I'm not at all surprised about.
[00:41:41.156 --> 00:41:42.597]  You know, you promised change, remember?
[00:41:44.478 --> 00:41:45.659]  Well, that's what we're going to have left.
[00:41:48.812 --> 00:41:51.033]  We're good to go.
[00:42:17.591 --> 00:42:19.418]  That's right, because it doesn't have any copper in it.
[00:42:19.799 --> 00:42:24.014]  Well, that aluminum gear tab is probably worth more than a penny.
[00:42:28.666 --> 00:42:34.328]  And these Svengali's, these scam artists, these magicians, just expand their scam every day.
[00:42:34.388 --> 00:42:37.148]  Just looting, controlling, it's all about domestication.
[00:42:37.608 --> 00:42:45.170]  We're going to come back, play these clips, keep Tommy about five minutes to the next hour, and we'll get his take on why the establishment's coming out and admitting everything they're doing to us.
[00:42:45.891 --> 00:42:47.771]  Well, it's because they think it's too late for us, folks.
[00:42:48.451 --> 00:42:50.132]  They think they got us by the short hairs.
[00:42:50.552 --> 00:42:51.572]  Tommy Cryer's our guest.
[00:42:51.752 --> 00:42:52.973]  Infowars.com.
[00:42:53.313 --> 00:42:53.733]  Stay with us.
[00:42:54.833 --> 00:42:56.694]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:42:56.834 --> 00:43:03.518]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:43:03.798 --> 00:43:11.963]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:43:12.183 --> 00:43:17.906]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:43:18.086 --> 00:43:19.867]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:43:19.927 --> 00:43:22.088]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:43:22.108 --> 00:43:26.470]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.771]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:43:28.871 --> 00:43:36.615]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:43:54.760 --> 00:44:00.002]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:44:00.575 --> 00:44:07.640]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:14.365]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:14.745 --> 00:44:16.566]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:16.726 --> 00:44:19.128]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:44:19.228 --> 00:44:30.176]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:44:30.797 --> 00:44:32.078]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:32.458 --> 00:44:33.859]  It's about a one world government.
[00:44:34.319 --> 00:44:40.642]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:44:41.222 --> 00:44:49.006]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:50.627]  The Obama Deception.
[00:44:51.067 --> 00:44:52.268]  The people strike back.
[00:44:54.045 --> 00:44:55.947]  Do you depend on the grocery store for your food?
[00:44:56.327 --> 00:44:58.109]  It's time to think outside the box.
[00:44:58.489 --> 00:45:00.191]  How about starting your own garden?
[00:45:00.451 --> 00:45:02.553]  To ensure your future, you purchase the seeds.
[00:45:02.713 --> 00:45:05.376]  To get the most out of your investment, you need the fertilizer.
[00:45:05.616 --> 00:45:10.641]  Whether or not you have good or bad soil, liquidorganicfertilizer.com has the solution.
[00:45:10.821 --> 00:45:12.963]  It's called Agran Natural Fertilizer.
[00:45:13.123 --> 00:45:13.403]  I think so.
[00:45:28.473 --> 00:45:28.873]  I think so.
[00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:00.492]  You know, I could have Tommy Crowder on for 10 hours.
[00:46:00.612 --> 00:46:02.354]  There's so many points he makes, so many things he does.
[00:46:02.374 --> 00:46:04.095]  We'll have him back on if he'll do it in the near future.
[00:46:04.115 --> 00:46:08.540]  We'll also plug, before he leaves us in about 10 minutes, how he can get involved in his truth attack.
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:10.982]  All over the country, others are doing this as well.
[00:46:11.002 --> 00:46:12.544]  Just getting out there, educating the sheeple.
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:30.225]  Okay, I want to go ahead and play this clip, and boy, as Strange Days have found us, they've been giving the talking orders with Glenn Beck, O'Reilly, all of them, Colter, Sean Hannity, to say, yes, the world government's real, yes, the New World Order's real, yes, they're taking over.
[00:46:30.605 --> 00:46:32.085]  Because they've lost all credibility.
[00:46:32.165 --> 00:46:34.906]  And now it's going to be their set-piece place to fight it.
[00:46:35.166 --> 00:46:41.988]  And you notice Beck says, arrest Ron Paul's supporters a year ago, then now he says he's our best friend, but then Monday, next Monday, he's going to discredit the FEMA camps.
[00:46:42.648 --> 00:46:47.912]  Coming up Friday, I'm going to do two hours on it and show you all the documents and video clips and show you how their attack's going to work as well.
[00:46:47.952 --> 00:46:49.814]  Not just the proof, but how they're going to attack Monday.
[00:46:50.074 --> 00:46:50.955]  And watch, I'll be right.
[00:46:51.275 --> 00:46:52.316]  I understand their operations.
[00:46:52.356 --> 00:46:53.076]  It'll be straw men.
[00:46:53.317 --> 00:46:56.339]  They'll show fake news about camps and then try to disprove it that way.
[00:46:56.359 --> 00:47:00.342]  But I want to get Tommy Cryer's comments in the next five minutes after these clips.
[00:47:00.662 --> 00:47:04.726]  Here's Ann Coulter a few days ago on Fox News.
[00:47:04.746 --> 00:47:10.090]  You can get videos on YouTube, but here's the audio talking about how she loves Ron Paul and is going to vote for him in 2012.
[00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:10.470]  Here it is.
[00:47:11.742 --> 00:47:13.444]  Who's the leading candidate for the Republicans for 2012?
[00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:15.525]  Um, I don't know.
[00:47:15.565 --> 00:47:17.127]  Has the New York Times picked him for us yet?
[00:47:17.247 --> 00:47:17.607]  I don't know.
[00:47:17.687 --> 00:47:18.908]  I keep hearing... They picked the last one.
[00:47:19.168 --> 00:47:19.989]  Yeah, I don't know.
[00:47:20.009 --> 00:47:20.810]  I didn't see the Times today.
[00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:21.250]  No thoughts?
[00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:21.991]  No thoughts?
[00:47:22.011 --> 00:47:22.971]  Um, I think Ron Paul.
[00:47:23.091 --> 00:47:24.292]  The war will be over.
[00:47:24.773 --> 00:47:26.955]  And basically, I agreed with Ron Paul on everything.
[00:47:26.975 --> 00:47:28.236]  There will be so much to clean up.
[00:47:28.276 --> 00:47:34.361]  I mean, other than war, we will have... I think even Obama... But Ron Paul will be in his 80s by then.
[00:47:35.151 --> 00:47:35.451]  You know.
[00:47:35.772 --> 00:47:38.194]  All right, that's enough of that.
[00:47:38.254 --> 00:47:39.536]  Now here's the next clip.
[00:47:39.916 --> 00:47:44.281]  Here is Dick Morris of the Clinton White House with Sean Hannity.
[00:47:45.102 --> 00:47:46.904]  And this was last night.
[00:47:47.504 --> 00:47:47.905]  Here it is.
[00:47:50.123 --> 00:47:57.445]  There is a big thing that's going to happen in London at this G20 and then they're hiding it, they're camouflaging it, they're not talking about it.
[00:47:58.445 --> 00:48:00.785]  Coordination of international regulation.
[00:48:01.385 --> 00:48:08.147]  What they are going to do is to put our Fed and our SEC under the control, in effect, of the IMF.
[00:48:08.447 --> 00:48:09.867]  Oh come on, do you believe they'll do this?
[00:48:09.907 --> 00:48:11.647]  That's what was in the draft agenda.
[00:48:12.108 --> 00:48:14.448]  They call it coordination of regulation.
[00:48:14.868 --> 00:48:19.109]  What it really is, is putting the American economy under international regulation.
[00:48:19.629 --> 00:48:24.214]  And those people who have been yelling, oh, the UN's going to take over, global government.
[00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:25.195]  Conspiracy theorists.
[00:48:25.455 --> 00:48:27.618]  They've been crazy, but now they're right.
[00:48:28.078 --> 00:48:38.429]  Well, when Geithner said he would be opening the idea of a global currency last week, those conspiracy people had said and suggested that for years.
[00:48:38.449 --> 00:48:39.030]  You're not wrong.
[00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:39.731]  You're not wrong.
[00:48:41.492 --> 00:48:48.596]  What they always do at these conferences is they have the center show is here, and the side show they don't want you to pay attention to.
[00:48:48.616 --> 00:48:51.438]  The center show is the size of the stimulus package.
[00:48:51.818 --> 00:48:58.782]  The real show is international regulation of the financial institutions, which is going to happen under the IMF control.
[00:48:59.102 --> 00:49:02.624]  And remember, the IMF is run by Europeans, the World Bank by Americans.
[00:49:02.644 --> 00:49:03.224]  All right.
[00:49:04.064 --> 00:49:05.185]  Now, the last clip.
[00:49:05.445 --> 00:49:08.607]  Here's Michael Savage two weeks ago, the government staging terror attacks.
[00:49:08.667 --> 00:49:09.087]  Here it is.
[00:49:11.653 --> 00:49:16.235]  Obama will create a crisis along the lines of the Reichstag fire.
[00:49:16.876 --> 00:49:34.584]  I don't know what form it will take, but I believe that once the minions are seen for what they are, Rahm Emanuel and his gang will set off a Reichstag fire in this country of some kind, and they will recall the military dictatorship of Lincoln and Stanton during the Civil War, when civilian suspects were arrested without warrant.
[00:49:35.294 --> 00:49:38.437]  I will tell you as I sit here, I fear that every night as I go to sleep.
[00:49:38.937 --> 00:49:46.523]  I put nothing past these agitators who have suddenly seized control of the most powerful economy and the most powerful military on earth.
[00:49:49.266 --> 00:49:50.587]  Now, why are they doing this?
[00:49:51.347 --> 00:49:52.849]  Because they've lost all credibility.
[00:49:52.889 --> 00:49:54.570]  They said none of this existed for all these years.
[00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:57.192]  Now it's all over the news this is being set up.
[00:49:57.593 --> 00:50:00.235]  It's all over TV, but the news is telling you it's good.
[00:50:00.255 --> 00:50:03.658]  So they have to play the part of the anti-establishment, oh now we're against it.
[00:50:04.378 --> 00:50:09.642]  And I agree, I've been saying for months that Obama's going to stage a big terror attack because his agenda is already stalling.
[00:50:10.242 --> 00:50:11.343]  And I predicted that months ago.
[00:50:11.804 --> 00:50:14.786]  So Tommy Cryer, back in 70 seconds, final five minute comments from you.
[00:50:14.806 --> 00:50:18.188]  You'll have the floor on this and then plug into your big events that are coming up.
[00:50:18.208 --> 00:50:19.389]  We appreciate you joining us.
[00:50:19.409 --> 00:50:21.391]  I want to get you on with Joe Bannister.
[00:50:21.411 --> 00:50:23.912]  That's a good idea to have you guys on for like an hour and a half, so you have plenty of time.
[00:50:24.213 --> 00:50:25.814]  But I wanted to get this in for everybody.
[00:50:25.974 --> 00:50:29.617]  So your conservative friends that deny this, you know, we're not conspiracy nuts.
[00:50:29.697 --> 00:50:30.697]  We read the documents.
[00:50:30.778 --> 00:50:31.398]  We were right.
[00:50:31.798 --> 00:50:32.479]  You were wrong.
[00:50:35.956 --> 00:50:37.778]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:39.219 --> 00:50:41.541]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:44.504 --> 00:50:45.085]  Hello, friends.
[00:50:45.145 --> 00:50:46.065]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:50:46.206 --> 00:50:50.790]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:53.692]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:50:53.913 --> 00:50:56.775]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:50:56.956 --> 00:51:01.680]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:02.821]  If you simply prepare.
[00:51:03.021 --> 00:51:05.984]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.

[00:51:33.669 --> 00:51:35.491]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:47.259 --> 00:51:49.187]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:49.649 --> 00:51:52.419]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:02.367 --> 00:52:11.349]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know we broke the secret MIAC report to make international news about them saying Ron Paul supporters, people that talk about the banks are terrorists, people that talk about the New World Order, it doesn't exist.
[00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:18.071]  I've got photos of the coffin, plastic coffin factory spewing out new coffins.
[00:52:18.471 --> 00:52:21.532]  This just came in from a truck driver picking them up to bring them to a FEMA camp.
[00:52:23.353 --> 00:52:25.353]  I have the letter right here.
[00:52:25.373 --> 00:52:31.295]  I'm not going to tell you what state.
[00:52:33.584 --> 00:52:34.544]  This is unbelievable.
[00:52:36.525 --> 00:52:38.386]  This is the type of stuff that just pours in.
[00:52:39.166 --> 00:52:40.667]  These are confirmed plastic coffins.
[00:52:40.687 --> 00:52:45.689]  You know, I may keep Tommy five minutes into the next hour, I mean, into the next segment, because I want to get to Mark Taylor and Mike.
[00:52:46.249 --> 00:52:46.929]  We'll see if we can do that.
[00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:52.352]  Mr. Cryer, you just heard all those clips where they're now admitting all this while before they said we were dangerous terrorists.
[00:52:52.692 --> 00:52:55.913]  Sean Hannity about five years ago said, arrest anybody that talks about this.
[00:52:56.393 --> 00:52:57.714]  Why are they having to admit it now?
[00:52:58.542 --> 00:53:02.265]  I don't think that they are admitting it for the purposes of truth or not.
[00:53:02.305 --> 00:53:06.668]  You have to remember that these people are not... You deal in the truth.
[00:53:07.769 --> 00:53:11.031]  That's what you have out there on the market.
[00:53:11.371 --> 00:53:12.512]  They deal in entertainment.
[00:53:13.073 --> 00:53:23.360]  Now, the fact that they are coming out and saying these things means that they're beginning to recognize that we have grown to the point to where we are an appreciable segment of the audience.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:27.383]  So they're having to give us some of our flavor of candy.
[00:53:28.075 --> 00:53:29.515]  Now, these guys don't care.
[00:53:30.476 --> 00:53:31.756]  They are part of the problem.
[00:53:32.816 --> 00:53:44.780]  But the fact that they are speaking to us as though they do is an indication, I think, that we're growing to the point to where we're becoming an undeniable segment of the world, a reality.
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.240]  Very astute.
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:49.661]  They're having to respond because we are becoming the majority.
[00:53:50.021 --> 00:53:56.723]  They have to respond because we have become a significant enough portion of society that we become a market.
[00:53:57.697 --> 00:53:58.117]  Now that's
[00:54:28.641 --> 00:54:29.481]  It's not a good thing.
[00:54:30.302 --> 00:54:38.246]  And so, this business of pandering is all that we have received from the so-called conservative.
[00:54:38.706 --> 00:54:52.514]  Have you ever heard Hannity, or have you ever heard Limbaugh, or have you ever heard even Dick Morris or any of these others talk about doing something about it?
[00:54:53.214 --> 00:54:57.056]  It's all just saying, don't kill us so fast, don't kill us, oh, you're doing it too quick.
[00:54:57.617 --> 00:54:58.077]  I don't know.
[00:55:20.066 --> 00:55:25.090]  Well, more than that, and I agree with the points you made, and that's certainly part of it, we've made those points.
[00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:31.995]  It's also the fact that they see we're growing so fast, that they understand they could lose this thing, so they're hedging their bets.
[00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:38.299]  And on top of that, because they see our growth rate, and I say we're probably the biggest one group out there, people that don't trust the government know about the New World Order.
[00:55:38.799 --> 00:55:40.321]  I mean, it's mainstream now.
[00:55:41.061 --> 00:55:44.704]  But also, they want to get our confidence so they can slip poison in.
[00:55:45.064 --> 00:55:46.565]  That's what Beck does.
[00:55:47.006 --> 00:55:49.127]  He'll say, one week I'm going to cover the FEMA copies.
[00:55:49.147 --> 00:55:50.689]  He goes, oh, I found out they're not real.
[00:55:50.969 --> 00:55:53.691]  We're going to debunk them when it's in the mainstream, you know, Associated Press.
[00:55:53.711 --> 00:55:55.232]  They built the FEMA camps for the people.
[00:55:55.272 --> 00:55:55.893]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:55:55.913 --> 00:55:59.075]  You know, just like the New York Times piece that recently ran, I met that guy.
[00:55:59.476 --> 00:56:01.537]  He was wanting to do a story on us.
[00:56:01.557 --> 00:56:04.860]  What he was wanting to do was a gut slash job.
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:07.262]  He was wanting to disembowel the movement.
[00:56:07.302 --> 00:56:08.623]  He was an interloper.
[00:56:09.628 --> 00:56:10.429]  I don't think so.
[00:56:22.867 --> 00:56:28.211]  You know, that's why we've got to get to the people and say, here's where your answers lie.
[00:56:28.611 --> 00:56:29.712]  Your answers lie in the truth.
[00:56:54.949 --> 00:57:03.696]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:57:03.876 --> 00:57:08.660]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:57:09.041 --> 00:57:20.150]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:57:20.550 --> 00:57:26.073]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[00:57:26.314 --> 00:57:32.377]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:57:32.577 --> 00:57:33.238]  What about you?
[00:57:33.618 --> 00:57:39.662]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[00:57:54.773 --> 00:58:00.099]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:00.579 --> 00:58:07.567]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:58:08.152 --> 00:58:14.354]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:14.735 --> 00:58:16.575]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:16.715 --> 00:58:19.116]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:19.216 --> 00:58:30.161]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:58:30.781 --> 00:58:32.061]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:32.461 --> 00:58:33.822]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:58:34.306 --> 00:58:40.632]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:58:41.233 --> 00:58:49.020]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:50.641]  The Obama Deception.
[00:58:51.062 --> 00:58:52.243]  The people strike back.
[00:58:54.398 --> 00:58:57.661]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:58:57.841 --> 00:59:01.905]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:59:02.085 --> 00:59:10.053]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[00:59:10.333 --> 00:59:10.753]  We're good to go.
[00:59:40.873 --> 00:59:47.015]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:59:47.175 --> 00:59:49.155]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.793 --> 01:00:13.134]  Well, we've got 52 minutes left of this broadcast today.
[01:00:13.174 --> 01:00:25.816]  I have breaking FEMA camp news and I can't give you much of the details because they don't want me to because it could alert folks to who they are, but I'm allowed to put these photos up on the web.
[01:00:26.497 --> 01:00:27.677]  This is not Georgia.
[01:00:29.157 --> 01:00:33.178]  This is the fellow, the truck driver,
[01:00:34.909 --> 01:00:37.050]  Picking up the FEMA coffins.
[01:00:37.891 --> 01:00:41.053]  They've got these in Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Texas, California.
[01:00:42.154 --> 01:00:43.374]  Picking them up at the factory.
[01:00:43.394 --> 01:00:44.475]  And we know the company.
[01:00:44.495 --> 01:00:46.917]  I mean, it's admitted these are mass coffins for CDC.
[01:00:47.357 --> 01:00:49.018]  And delivering them to another location.
[01:00:50.359 --> 01:00:51.460]  And that's all I'm allowed to tell you.
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.460]  But, you know what?
[01:00:52.821 --> 01:00:55.562]  Go ahead and give these to Tim or one of the guys in the back.
[01:00:57.283 --> 01:00:58.864]  Have the guys scan these in.
[01:00:58.904 --> 01:01:02.387]  Don't have Rob do it or Jason do it, because they're busy making a video map.
[01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:12.416]  of the one of the big FEMA facilities and then the tent cities where they're forcing them out to the FEMA facility so that this all dovetails.
[01:01:12.456 --> 01:01:15.178]  It's coming up at the next segment in about 15 minutes.
[01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:16.839]  They'll be with us till the end of the show.
[01:01:16.859 --> 01:01:17.880]  I know we got loaded phone lines.
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:19.381]  We're going to Mark Taylor and Mike right now.
[01:01:19.661 --> 01:01:21.122]  Just so much is breaking so fast.
[01:01:21.462 --> 01:01:31.209]  Give that to Aaron Dykes and then just tell him to post it and he'll hear me talk about it but just basically a truck driver went and picked them up at the factory making them
[01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:32.450]  Yeah.
[01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:33.771]  Yeah, and it's accelerating.
[01:01:33.811 --> 01:01:35.353]  And that's why we have to accelerate.
[01:01:52.524 --> 01:01:56.526]  That's why we have to... Truth Attack has a comprehensive plan.
[01:01:57.206 --> 01:02:03.009]  We need funding for a lot of it, but we can't implement it yet, but we've got a lot going on.
[01:02:03.849 --> 01:02:08.351]  We've managed to finally pick up Liberty Works Radio Network.
[01:02:08.531 --> 01:02:12.193]  It'll be kicking on mid-April already, going on air.
[01:02:13.913 --> 01:02:17.575]  I want to personally, by the way, invite InfoWars and you, Alex,
[01:02:18.303 --> 01:02:21.085]  Yes sir, but it's coming up, it's going to be all true liberty.
[01:02:21.105 --> 01:02:23.446]  It's not going to be entertainment, it's going to be truth.
[01:02:23.526 --> 01:02:27.169]  And it's going to have every sector of the freedom movement will be represented.
[01:02:41.129 --> 01:02:41.670]  We're good to go.
[01:02:54.995 --> 01:02:55.876]  We're going to fire it up April 15th.
[01:02:55.896 --> 01:02:57.237]  It's going to be absolutely fantastic.
[01:02:57.397 --> 01:02:59.699]  Truth Attack will have a drive-time show every afternoon of the week.
[01:03:25.107 --> 01:03:27.948]  There'll be a lot of other entertainment TV kids going to be on there.
[01:03:28.009 --> 01:03:29.229]  You know how wonderful she is.
[01:03:29.249 --> 01:03:34.311]  It wouldn't be a bad thing for Alex Jones to be on that network, too.
[01:03:34.792 --> 01:03:38.433]  For once, the Freedom Movement is starting to act together and fold those fingers up into a fist.
[01:03:38.473 --> 01:03:39.654]  It's been easy to break our fingers.
[01:03:46.912 --> 01:03:53.575]  But when you roll them up into a fist, not only is it hard to break them, but you can start breaking things with that fist.
[01:03:54.275 --> 01:03:57.136]  And I've never seen the kind of activity that we've seen this year.
[01:03:58.237 --> 01:04:01.598]  Truth Attack has gotten a huge response from across the freedom movement.
[01:04:01.678 --> 01:04:07.720]  Not just tax honesty issues people, but libertarian people, constitutional party people, education people.
[01:04:08.561 --> 01:04:11.782]  They all see the value in cutting off the roots.
[01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.991]  Absolutely.
[01:04:13.051 --> 01:04:14.432]  Tommy, we're almost out of time.
[01:04:14.472 --> 01:04:15.292]  Fire out the website again.
[01:04:15.312 --> 01:04:16.253]  We're going to take three calls.
[01:04:16.533 --> 01:04:26.040]  It's truthintech.org and you can get on there, register for Operation Stop Thief and receive your free mat pack and free signs if you can get in this week.
[01:04:26.081 --> 01:04:29.223]  Next week we won't be able to send out anything but the materials packages without
[01:04:29.989 --> 01:04:30.730]  But it's all free.
[01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.212]  We supply the science.
[01:04:32.232 --> 01:04:34.254]  We ship them.
[01:04:34.294 --> 01:04:34.915]  Absolutely.
[01:04:34.935 --> 01:04:37.358]  And they have a blast, Alex.
[01:04:37.378 --> 01:04:44.006]  These guys write back and they're talking about how much fun they're having.
[01:04:44.126 --> 01:04:45.407]  It's fun to fight back.
[01:04:45.467 --> 01:04:46.849]  It's fun to stand up.
[01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:49.052]  We push it in the instructions.
[01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:51.153]  We're not afraid of fighters, we're afraid of lovers.
[01:04:51.213 --> 01:04:54.615]  And this is, we're celebrating because this is a big step forward.
[01:04:54.715 --> 01:04:54.996]  Hey!
[01:04:55.316 --> 01:04:57.517]  We get to be part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:04:57.557 --> 01:04:59.198]  We don't have a choice, we gotta fight the globalists.
[01:04:59.398 --> 01:05:03.161]  We're having huge success, everybody should be more positive, and this is a big part of the solution.
[01:05:03.201 --> 01:05:06.183]  Let's take three calls that are specifically for you, then I'll get to everybody else.
[01:05:06.543 --> 01:05:09.725]  Mark in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air with Tommy Cryer who beat the IRS.
[01:05:09.745 --> 01:05:10.085]  Go ahead.
[01:05:11.166 --> 01:05:14.448]  Hey Mr. Cryer and Mr. Jones, or Alex, thank you for your time.
[01:05:14.508 --> 01:05:15.369]  I'm glad to be with y'all.
[01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:20.192]  I have a book from a fellow back in the 1960s.
[01:05:20.392 --> 01:05:22.514]  His name is Norman F. Dacey.
[01:05:23.094 --> 01:05:26.776]  He was a probate, a will and estates person.
[01:05:27.337 --> 01:05:45.608]  He was helping people and he just exposed the whole corrupt system of the judges, lawyers, the whole... And his statement in the beginning of his second chapter of calling probate the ugly side, he said, woe unto you lawyers if you have taken away the
[01:05:46.946 --> 01:05:50.829]  Not in yourselves and them that were entering in, you hindered.
[01:05:50.849 --> 01:06:06.463]  I saw that the first paragraph, it says, in most areas of this country, the probate procedure is a scandal, a form of tribute levied by the legal profession upon the estate of its victims, both living and dead.
[01:06:06.883 --> 01:06:12.548]  And it mentioned many of people that were kids that were disabled and these corrupt people were just constantly taking their money.
[01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:15.782]  And I haven't researched all of this significantly.
[01:06:15.842 --> 01:06:21.748]  My expertise is in the natural health field for about 20 years, and that was the reason with my original call.
[01:06:21.768 --> 01:06:31.737]  But when I noted that y'all were talking about this, when I got little bits of the call, when I had my other line, I figured, well, I'd ask a question and see what this fellow here had thought about.
[01:06:32.438 --> 01:06:33.198]  And I had one other...
[01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:35.331]  Well, not exactly.
[01:06:35.351 --> 01:06:37.133]  You could make a case for that because you could take exceptions.
[01:06:53.797 --> 01:07:08.391]  I've probably handled 400, maybe even 500 estates over the course of my career, and they've always gone through smoothly and at a nominal expense, without any siphoning off.
[01:07:09.786 --> 01:07:13.827]  The courts aren't doing anything but maybe a hundred or two dollars for filing fees.
[01:07:14.407 --> 01:07:16.507]  Attorneys don't charge that much for an estate.
[01:07:16.567 --> 01:07:18.388]  But I have seen the horror stories, don't they?
[01:07:18.428 --> 01:07:19.108]  My family's dead.
[01:07:19.148 --> 01:07:23.629]  There are horror stories because there are abusive and predatory attorneys out there.
[01:07:24.229 --> 01:07:29.550]  And we do have, with respect to larger estates, we have a very abusive and predatory government.
[01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:31.130]  But I do want to warn people.
[01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:32.890]  I do want to warn people.
[01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:36.431]  One of the most predatory groups I've seen per capita is the fake
[01:07:37.752 --> 01:08:01.554]  uh... patriots that are out there i call a patriot mythology and be crap discoveries maybe can briefly mention it per capita of the most abusive thing i've seen they will sit there and tell people they're setting up a trust and steal their property and i'm telling you i mean there's a falsely tell you the most dangerous thing out there is is the fake patriot movement uh... these uh... quote you know they're usually they're not lawyers go ahead
[01:08:01.994 --> 01:08:05.695]  Yeah, and they're lawyer wannabes, or they call themselves lay lawyers.
[01:08:05.836 --> 01:08:06.536]  One guy does.
[01:08:06.556 --> 01:08:10.357]  I'm just glad he doesn't wish he was smart enough to have been a brain surgeon.
[01:08:10.417 --> 01:08:13.018]  I only operate on my friends just on weekends.
[01:08:13.778 --> 01:08:23.762]  But there's a lot of that, and I think a lot of it, too, originates with the government, because they're the only ones that benefit from this, from those things.
[01:08:23.982 --> 01:08:27.364]  And you've got a lot of people out there that are P.A.Y.
[01:08:27.664 --> 01:08:28.184]  patriots.
[01:08:28.996 --> 01:08:29.536]  We're good to go.
[01:08:56.226 --> 01:08:56.806]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:08:56.846 --> 01:08:57.866]  Folks, watch out.
[01:08:57.927 --> 01:09:02.968]  Any charlatan that says, I'll get you out of taxes, you know, let me be the trustee of the trust or my friend.
[01:09:03.468 --> 01:09:05.509]  I have watched him and I've warned people in Austin.
[01:09:05.529 --> 01:09:06.349]  They never listen.
[01:09:06.369 --> 01:09:07.189]  They get ripped off.
[01:09:07.589 --> 01:09:08.910]  And these people all hate me.
[01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:10.790]  Boy, you wouldn't believe how much they hate me.
[01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:13.351]  But I will not sit here and watch their criminal activity.
[01:09:13.911 --> 01:09:16.392]  Let's go ahead and talk to Taylor in Florida.
[01:09:16.412 --> 01:09:17.532]  Taylor, you're on the air with our guests.
[01:09:17.552 --> 01:09:17.872]  Go ahead.
[01:09:19.913 --> 01:09:20.593]  Hi, Alex.
[01:09:20.633 --> 01:09:21.793]  Thanks for having me, man.
[01:09:21.873 --> 01:09:23.614]  First of all, I'd like to say thank you for
[01:09:24.136 --> 01:09:27.337]  Everything that you've been doing, everything that you do for your job on a daily basis.
[01:09:27.717 --> 01:09:31.379]  You're a brave American who stands for everything Americans should.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.020]  Second of all, thank you, Tommy.
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.802]  I really agree with what you're saying about the consolidate.
[01:09:38.822 --> 01:09:44.224]  What we really need to do right now is... I really have a question.
[01:09:44.244 --> 01:09:49.066]  My question is, what we really need to do, first of all, is the spread of information is going.
[01:09:50.327 --> 01:09:52.427]  People are definitely becoming aware.
[01:09:52.467 --> 01:09:53.708]  The scary thing is about it, though,
[01:09:54.295 --> 01:09:54.375]  It's
[01:10:13.863 --> 01:10:19.064]  Quit being scared of talking about it, because the thing is, people are weak, but people want to live their lives.
[01:10:19.084 --> 01:10:27.526]  That's right, and the Trojan Horses, I appreciate your call, Glenn Beck and others, they're going to falsely lead people into a false patriot movement.
[01:10:27.546 --> 01:10:28.446]  Do you agree, Tommy Cryer?
[01:10:28.967 --> 01:10:29.507]  I do agree.
[01:10:29.567 --> 01:10:32.207]  I think that they want to lead us off.
[01:10:32.367 --> 01:10:34.888]  It's misdirection and disinformation.
[01:10:35.601 --> 01:10:36.121]  I don't know.
[01:10:36.181 --> 01:10:36.781]  I don't know.
[01:10:57.428 --> 01:10:58.850]  One tentacle at a time.
[01:10:58.890 --> 01:11:00.351]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:11:00.371 --> 01:11:00.871]  Anytime.
[01:11:21.772 --> 01:11:22.032]  You bet.
[01:11:22.072 --> 01:11:23.214]  Good to have you here with us today.
[01:11:23.234 --> 01:11:23.955]  I appreciate that.
[01:11:24.316 --> 01:11:33.309]  Okay, we're going to break and then coming up, I'm going to get into the shantytowns all over the country that they're shutting down, grabbing their children, grabbing...
[01:11:34.389 --> 01:11:34.909]  Their cars.
[01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:40.132]  Not letting them have a job while they live in the shantytown so they can build up enough money to get out of it.
[01:11:40.433 --> 01:11:42.514]  They take them to these camps where they're basically prisoners.
[01:11:43.775 --> 01:11:47.637]  We have eyewitnesses there that work in this office who've just spent four days in California.
[01:11:47.937 --> 01:11:50.539]  One of the worst areas affected by the implosion, by the depression.
[01:11:50.779 --> 01:11:53.040]  Then I'll get into the latest FEMA coffin stuff.
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.301]  Got a big one on that front.
[01:11:55.071 --> 01:11:57.772]  Are you tired of losing your hard-earned savings in retirement?
[01:11:58.172 --> 01:12:04.734]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[01:12:05.194 --> 01:12:09.475]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.
[01:12:10.015 --> 01:12:19.558]  Call me at 800-686-2237 extension 115 and I will explain to you how to retain your wealth and purchasing power now and in the future with gold and silver.
[01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:29.712]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years compared to our present fiat currency, which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[01:12:30.053 --> 01:12:37.420]  Call me Dwayne Dally at 800-686-2237 extension 115 to start your protection of wealth today.
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:40.903]  I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.
[01:12:41.404 --> 01:12:42.725]  No amount is too small.
[01:12:42.785 --> 01:12:43.606]  So start today.
[01:12:44.190 --> 01:12:47.192]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:12:47.212 --> 01:12:51.434]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:13:07.026 --> 01:13:13.227]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:13:13.527 --> 01:13:15.348]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:13:15.508 --> 01:13:17.888]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:13:17.948 --> 01:13:28.891]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:13:31.131 --> 01:13:32.432]  It's not about left or right.
[01:13:32.812 --> 01:13:34.172]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:13:34.665 --> 01:13:40.993]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:13:41.573 --> 01:13:49.363]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:13:49.843 --> 01:13:50.985]  The Obama Deception.
[01:13:51.425 --> 01:13:52.607]  The people strike back.
[01:13:54.375 --> 01:13:55.775]  So you want to stop smoking.
[01:13:55.835 --> 01:13:56.956]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[01:13:57.116 --> 01:13:59.877]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[01:13:59.997 --> 01:14:03.818]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[01:14:03.978 --> 01:14:07.519]  And if, and only if, you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it.
[01:14:07.759 --> 01:14:09.700]  Most likely, if you try this, you'd be arrested.
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:13.701]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the Smokefree free trial offer is.
[01:14:14.061 --> 01:14:16.862]  Smokefree is a complete all-natural stop smoking system.
[01:14:16.982 --> 01:14:19.663]  And when you call today, they'll send you a 30-day supply of the program,
[01:14:19.963 --> 01:14:20.824]  Absolutely free!
[01:14:21.144 --> 01:14:34.596]  This program eliminates withdrawals and cravings and includes a 30 day supply of the smoke-free capsules, a guide to living smoke-free book, an audio support program, capsule holder, and a bottle of weight loss capsules just in case you're worried about gaining weight while you're trying to quit.
[01:14:34.796 --> 01:14:37.078]  To find out if you qualify for this free trial offer,
[01:14:37.378 --> 01:14:40.300]  Join the tens of thousands who have quit for life with Smoke Free.
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:41.021]  Call 1-800-426-6186 today!
[01:14:41.041 --> 01:14:41.281]  That's 1-800-426-6186.
[01:14:41.301 --> 01:14:43.162]  This is a limited time offer, so call 1-800-426-6186 now!
[01:14:54.605 --> 01:15:00.086]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:15:00.126 --> 01:15:00.646]  and the world.
[01:15:00.906 --> 01:15:04.367]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:15:04.767 --> 01:15:11.009]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:15:11.269 --> 01:15:13.049]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:15:13.289 --> 01:15:21.251]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:15:21.531 --> 01:15:25.955]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:15:26.216 --> 01:15:31.761]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[01:15:32.041 --> 01:15:34.043]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[01:15:34.224 --> 01:15:36.466]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[01:15:36.806 --> 01:15:37.586]  Free of charge.
[01:15:37.886 --> 01:15:38.206]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[01:15:38.226 --> 01:15:38.286]  1-800-453-2202.
[01:15:38.306 --> 01:15:39.827]  Or visit our website at readyreservefoods.com.
[01:15:39.847 --> 01:15:41.968]  Factory direct, wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:15:41.988 --> 01:15:42.348]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[01:16:06.775 --> 01:16:07.457]  We're good.
[01:16:18.812 --> 01:16:21.253]  I've got Rob Doo and Jason Douglas out there.
[01:16:21.273 --> 01:16:25.375]  They're so busy trying to make a map of the shantytowns that they're not in here.
[01:16:25.475 --> 01:16:27.236]  But here they come.
[01:16:27.836 --> 01:16:30.697]  Guys, we need to get you on air because the show doesn't have much time left here.
[01:16:30.717 --> 01:16:33.199]  We've got about 35 minutes of broadcast time left.
[01:16:33.279 --> 01:16:38.081]  Ah, yes, there's Rob Doo coming in here and getting in studio with us right now.
[01:16:38.141 --> 01:16:39.021]  You don't even need headphones.
[01:16:39.041 --> 01:16:40.022]  We're not going to be taking calls.
[01:16:40.062 --> 01:16:44.103]  So I want to get both of your reports on what happened.
[01:16:45.284 --> 01:16:46.745]  Where is Jason Douglas?
[01:16:46.765 --> 01:16:47.345]  He's on his way.
[01:16:48.541 --> 01:16:49.323]  He's on his way, sorry.
[01:16:58.168 --> 01:17:00.770]  I want to commend you both on air for the great job you've done.
[01:17:00.930 --> 01:17:01.471]  Well, thank you.
[01:17:01.751 --> 01:17:02.712]  We were working on a map.
[01:17:03.333 --> 01:17:08.838]  We went to Google Maps and downloaded a satellite image, which Hugh should be pulling up any time now.
[01:17:09.018 --> 01:17:10.339]  Yeah, well, during another break we can show it.
[01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:13.462]  Kind of explain the vastness of the area that we were looking at.
[01:17:16.164 --> 01:17:23.391]  It's a large area, and then there's some areas that are really concentrated and some areas that were sparsely populated with tents.
[01:17:24.151 --> 01:17:26.293]  I want to start from the beginning.
[01:17:26.313 --> 01:17:28.954]  We're not going to be taking any calls, so we don't even need those.
[01:17:29.415 --> 01:17:30.195]  But that's fine.
[01:17:31.036 --> 01:17:33.357]  Let's go ahead and start over with you guys here.
[01:17:33.818 --> 01:17:36.259]  I have folks that work here in the office, do a great job.
[01:17:36.799 --> 01:17:38.461]  We have Rob Dew, and of course Jason Douglas.
[01:17:38.561 --> 01:17:44.665]  I've seen you guys last Friday out of California, started in Southern California, San Diego, LA, moved up to Sacramento.
[01:17:45.245 --> 01:17:48.907]  And for the listeners out there tuning in, tell the story.
[01:17:48.947 --> 01:17:50.448]  Tell folks what you witnessed, what happened.
[01:17:50.809 --> 01:17:51.049]  Alright.
[01:17:51.549 --> 01:17:52.130]  You want to go first?
[01:17:53.292 --> 01:17:53.653]  Fill him in.
[01:17:54.053 --> 01:18:10.605]  Okay, well, we land in Long Beach and we stayed there the night, we got in kind of late, and the next morning we went to just go shoot some shots and check out a park that was near where we were that supposedly has a lot of homeless to try to find out, you know, the tent city areas around there.
[01:18:11.366 --> 01:18:20.553]  And so we wake up and we're shooting stuff and we hear these cadences and marchings and we look over and it's these group of youths in white t-shirts and shorts and
[01:18:21.914 --> 01:18:27.976]  They were being bused in by the Sheriff's Department and they were doing exercises and there was three busloads of people.
[01:18:28.036 --> 01:18:31.637]  Plus there were other vans and Sheriff's Police cars.
[01:18:31.657 --> 01:18:33.358]  It was all Sheriff's Department stuff.
[01:18:33.378 --> 01:18:33.838]  What was this?
[01:18:33.898 --> 01:18:34.578]  I haven't even heard of this.
[01:18:34.699 --> 01:18:36.739]  Well, yeah, there was so much to see.
[01:18:36.759 --> 01:18:39.060]  I mean, that was the first thing we saw when we got up the next morning.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.521]  Some kind of youth brigade thing.
[01:18:40.541 --> 01:18:41.881]  I mean, it's something like that.
[01:18:41.901 --> 01:18:42.541]  Did you get footage of that?
[01:18:42.661 --> 01:18:43.802]  Oh yeah, we have lots of footage of that.
[01:18:43.842 --> 01:18:44.582]  What is this insanity?
[01:18:44.962 --> 01:19:14.182]  And so and then we even brought the cameras over and you know I set it down and pretended like it wasn't on aimed it right at the guy said hey you know we're just from Austin Texas right here shooting some footage you know what's going on and and he kind of laid it out it's it's a program that where the sheriff's it's sort of their youth outreach to for people who want to go into law enforcement try to convince people to go into law enforcement they bring them out there on Saturdays and they do marches and and cadences and exercises and running I guess they're running up and down the pier
[01:19:14.942 --> 01:19:15.983]  They were doing all kinds of stuff.
[01:19:16.023 --> 01:19:18.244]  And that all sounds reasonable, but the state's out of control.
[01:19:18.284 --> 01:19:18.364]  Sure.
[01:19:18.584 --> 01:19:20.185]  This is what Russia, China, everybody did.
[01:19:20.205 --> 01:19:21.246]  They get them while they're young.
[01:19:21.486 --> 01:19:21.967]  Right, right.
[01:19:22.267 --> 01:19:27.130]  And it seems like, because I had actually heard of this where I was from in Louisiana, they had the same thing like this.
[01:19:27.150 --> 01:19:27.830]  No, it's going on everywhere.
[01:19:27.870 --> 01:19:31.212]  It's Secure Corps, but they do it locally with the federal dollars.
[01:19:31.252 --> 01:19:34.174]  They try to warrant apprehension, gun confiscation.
[01:19:34.214 --> 01:19:34.915]  That's been in the news.
[01:19:35.015 --> 01:19:38.397]  I mean, these kids all look like they would be ready to follow any order they were given.
[01:19:38.437 --> 01:19:39.517]  Yeah, they were very serious.
[01:19:39.998 --> 01:19:40.958]  They were very serious.
[01:19:41.018 --> 01:19:41.679]  How old were they?
[01:19:42.626 --> 01:19:43.908]  Uh, what would you say, 14 to 17?
[01:19:43.948 --> 01:19:45.390]  14 to maybe 17, yeah.
[01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:46.592]  Exactly like Russia.
[01:19:46.752 --> 01:19:46.972]  Yeah.
[01:19:47.172 --> 01:19:51.979]  I mean, it was definitely, you know, and they were all in march, in cadence, doing the thing.
[01:19:52.039 --> 01:19:53.301]  It was a well-oiled machine.
[01:19:53.341 --> 01:19:53.601]  Yeah.
[01:19:53.661 --> 01:19:57.086]  Hey, will somebody email us and tell me which one of my films is it?
[01:19:58.413 --> 01:20:07.924]  Is it police state, three total enslavement, or is it masters of terror where I have the Russian newscast in English where it goes, these guys, these children are ready to get tough on tax cheats.
[01:20:07.944 --> 01:20:12.849]  Shows like 14-year-olds practicing karate chops and they send them to government homes to be trained for this.
[01:20:12.969 --> 01:20:13.230]  Wow.
[01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:14.171]  We ought to pull that up.
[01:20:14.691 --> 01:20:16.192]  Yeah, that was amazing.
[01:20:16.212 --> 01:20:17.493]  That was just the first part of the day.
[01:20:17.553 --> 01:20:21.196]  And then we spent the rest of the day driving around L.A.
[01:20:21.376 --> 01:20:22.416]  looking at these spots.
[01:20:22.496 --> 01:20:24.178]  Jason's from, you know, L.A.
[01:20:24.218 --> 01:20:26.859]  and, you know, why don't you tell them a little bit about that, driving around L.A.?
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:33.244]  Yeah, I basically went to all the hot spots where I know there's high concentrations of homeless before we left.
[01:20:33.284 --> 01:20:34.865]  And one of the reasons that we went to L.A.
[01:20:34.925 --> 01:20:37.147]  was because we kept hearing these stories about
[01:20:38.227 --> 01:20:45.113]  Um, the homeless there getting tickets, $154 tickets for being on the street or not having a home.
[01:20:45.393 --> 01:20:46.714]  Illegal camping is what they were doing.
[01:20:46.734 --> 01:20:47.435]  Illegal camping.
[01:20:47.455 --> 01:20:48.816]  But the illegal aliens are left alone.
[01:20:49.336 --> 01:20:50.117]  Right, right, of course.
[01:20:50.917 --> 01:21:01.346]  So, um, we just went to all the hotspots where I knew that they should be, and indeed, we didn't see anybody on the street, so we can only suppose that they've either been rounded up,
[01:21:02.321 --> 01:21:05.703]  Well, you said you were told by people that, oh, there was a camp here, but they moved it.
[01:21:05.763 --> 01:21:05.863]  Right.
[01:21:05.883 --> 01:21:07.364]  And now we found out in the L.A.
[01:21:07.384 --> 01:21:13.428]  Times, I wish we'd have had this before you left, that was in the news Saturday, that they have one outside L.A.
[01:21:14.729 --> 01:21:15.390]  In Ontario.
[01:21:15.410 --> 01:21:15.750]  In Ontario.
[01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:19.713]  And they're wearing wristbands.
[01:21:19.753 --> 01:21:21.754]  They're taking their children, taking their Winnebago's.
[01:21:22.054 --> 01:21:24.256]  Then you got the same news report when you were up in Sacramento.
[01:21:24.396 --> 01:21:24.916]  Eyewitnesses.
[01:21:24.936 --> 01:21:25.537]  Stay there, guys.
[01:21:25.957 --> 01:21:27.678]  I just want to say, super job.
[01:21:27.698 --> 01:21:31.280]  I don't even know the time we have left in the show, but we'd have to debrief you on this and all you saw.
[01:21:32.461 --> 01:21:38.809]  I want you to go through it all in detail as fast as possible when we get back with Jason Douglas and Rob Dew.
[01:21:39.289 --> 01:21:40.671]  Great info warriors here on the team.
[01:21:40.691 --> 01:21:43.715]  We're introducing everybody today.
[01:21:44.776 --> 01:21:45.677]  We're on the march.
[01:21:46.177 --> 01:21:47.779]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:51.384]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:54.511 --> 01:21:56.013]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:21:56.193 --> 01:21:57.655]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:21:57.955 --> 01:22:00.178]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:22:00.638 --> 01:22:05.384]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:22:05.784 --> 01:22:08.628]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:22:08.968 --> 01:22:12.432]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[01:22:12.853 --> 01:22:24.842]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[01:22:25.402 --> 01:22:27.404]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[01:22:27.424 --> 01:22:28.725]  I use one every day.
[01:22:29.145 --> 01:22:31.587]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:22:31.967 --> 01:22:33.528]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:22:58.146 --> 01:23:00.268]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:23:00.768 --> 01:23:07.795]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:23:08.337 --> 01:23:14.539]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:23:14.939 --> 01:23:16.760]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:19.321]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:23:19.401 --> 01:23:30.345]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:23:30.985 --> 01:23:32.265]  It's not about left or right.
[01:23:32.665 --> 01:23:34.026]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:23:34.514 --> 01:23:40.820]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:23:49.687 --> 01:23:50.828]  The Obama Deception.
[01:23:51.269 --> 01:23:52.450]  The people strike back.
[01:23:54.562 --> 01:23:57.944]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:23:58.084 --> 01:24:03.307]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:24:03.487 --> 01:24:08.270]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:19.757]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:24:20.157 --> 01:24:25.700]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:32.003]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:24:32.203 --> 01:24:32.864]  What about you?
[01:24:33.244 --> 01:24:39.267]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for our special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:25:05.819 --> 01:25:06.799]  We are back live.
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:11.682]  By the end of the show today, it's going up on InfoWars.com, another exclusive.
[01:25:13.356 --> 01:25:16.618]  We'll tell ya, it's Alabama and surrounding states.
[01:25:17.378 --> 01:25:24.441]  Going to the factory that makes the admitted plastic coffins for the CDC they're putting all over the 50 states.
[01:25:25.562 --> 01:25:29.784]  Colorado, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Texas, Michigan.
[01:25:31.845 --> 01:25:33.526]  And these are brand new coffins.
[01:25:34.747 --> 01:25:40.229]  being made and being shipped off the government holding facilities and fields all over the country.
[01:25:40.730 --> 01:25:44.351]  And those photos, new ones, with all the other mass graves and other coffin videos.
[01:25:44.851 --> 01:25:46.672]  And Aaron's listening right now as he uploads all this.
[01:25:46.692 --> 01:25:47.293]  Doing a great job.
[01:25:47.353 --> 01:25:50.174]  Aaron, add a link for people who've written past stories.
[01:25:50.534 --> 01:25:52.155]  Say, here's the company that sold the coffins.
[01:25:52.175 --> 01:25:52.675]  They admit it.
[01:25:52.915 --> 01:25:54.596]  It's for the CDC and a mass plague.
[01:25:55.475 --> 01:26:03.821]  And then maybe put a link in there from the Real Newscaster, a news story where we had the emergency manager on, talking about how the Feds told him to get ready for mass graves outside Chicago.
[01:26:03.841 --> 01:26:05.302]  Okay, I'm going to shop about that.
[01:26:05.342 --> 01:26:09.646]  It'll be up on Infowars.com a few minutes after the show ends or so.
[01:26:09.666 --> 01:26:12.548]  I'm going to get there in time to get all the subbies in there scanning like 20 photos.
[01:26:13.729 --> 01:26:15.470]  We're allowed to post the photos that were sent to us.
[01:26:15.490 --> 01:26:17.872]  It pretty much shows you it's Alabama, so we'll just say that.
[01:26:18.892 --> 01:26:20.754]  But the truck driver doesn't want much more than that said.
[01:26:21.174 --> 01:26:22.915]  Okay, gentlemen, I'm going to try to sit here and shut up.
[01:26:22.935 --> 01:26:24.517]  We're also taping for the film because I want to
[01:26:25.357 --> 01:26:28.419]  Did you guys interview each other while you were out there about what you were seeing and witnessing?
[01:26:29.219 --> 01:26:35.122]  A little bit, but not as... I mean, we were trying to concentrate more on the subject matter, but we did shoot some stuff of us driving around.
[01:26:35.162 --> 01:26:39.664]  Yeah, it's just this film's going to be cinema verite with no voiceover, but that's great.
[01:26:39.704 --> 01:26:41.785]  We'll interview you here, which is better in the field.
[01:26:42.185 --> 01:26:44.426]  But it was so quick, I didn't really give you directions.
[01:26:44.606 --> 01:26:46.007]  Towards the end, we started doing that.
[01:26:46.167 --> 01:26:50.230]  Yeah, and I mean, the whole trip kind of evolved as we went on.
[01:26:50.971 --> 01:26:53.993]  We finished up searching around LA.
[01:26:54.073 --> 01:27:06.483]  We ran into a guy who, and I think I talked to you about this on the air, who was losing his small business and he had taken a second mortgage out on his home and he was a massage teacher.
[01:27:06.503 --> 01:27:07.604]  He had opened up a massage school.
[01:27:07.684 --> 01:27:08.385]  Well, let's do it this way.
[01:27:08.425 --> 01:27:10.947]  Let's stop right here because I just started thinking to tape this.
[01:27:11.747 --> 01:27:19.333]  Start over, you know, what you did, what you witnessed, kind of run through it, and then the key stuff, they're grabbing their kids, they're grabbing their cars, and then the illegal aliens are above the lobby.
[01:27:19.373 --> 01:27:20.594]  Break down just everything.
[01:27:20.614 --> 01:27:21.955]  You got the floor, I'm just going to sit back.
[01:27:22.175 --> 01:27:33.704]  Okay, well, that morning we start off in Long Beach and we witnessed the, you know, kind of Obama Youth Brigade type activity going on at the dock, or at the wharf there.
[01:27:37.487 --> 01:27:38.268]  And that was interesting.
[01:27:38.428 --> 01:27:41.509]  We were driving around Long Beach, and then we went into L.A.
[01:27:41.670 --> 01:27:43.290]  Where were the places we went?
[01:27:43.330 --> 01:27:44.891]  Jason knows L.A.
[01:27:45.071 --> 01:27:48.493]  We came through downtown, and I took him off to see some of the hotbeds.
[01:27:48.994 --> 01:27:52.796]  We went through Watts and South Central, just looking around there.
[01:27:52.856 --> 01:27:53.756]  We went downtown L.A.
[01:27:53.956 --> 01:27:54.337]  We went
[01:27:55.117 --> 01:27:55.558]  I don't know.
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:20.142]  You know, and then we finished up heading out into Sacramento.
[01:28:21.103 --> 01:28:27.047]  Before that, we met this guy, Dr. John, and he told us his story, and we'll have video of all that.
[01:28:27.087 --> 01:28:39.036]  He made this big sign, and he's actually had people coming in because of this sign and talking about the bailout and AIG, coming in agreeing with him, you know, that Obama's not doing a good job and, you know, he doesn't see a lot of people, and he actually voted for Obama.
[01:28:39.156 --> 01:28:42.639]  And he, you know, a lot of these people that we talked to, they think Obama is going to save them.
[01:28:42.739 --> 01:28:44.620]  They really are out of touch.
[01:28:45.481 --> 01:28:49.644]  We met a guy in Venice Beach who was, you know, saying the same things.
[01:28:49.684 --> 01:28:50.865]  He thinks Obama's going to do it.
[01:28:51.185 --> 01:28:58.271]  They're aware of the corruption that's going on, but they don't see the difference between Obama and, you know, the corruptors.
[01:28:58.311 --> 01:28:58.931]  Well, it's crazy.
[01:28:58.991 --> 01:29:08.759]  In the same breath that they'll say something like, oh, I can't believe Obama did this, or what about, you know, we don't agree with the bailouts, they'll say, but Obama's going to save us.
[01:29:08.939 --> 01:29:09.159]  Yeah.
[01:29:09.399 --> 01:29:13.661]  Even though they just said, you know, some of the things that he's doing wrong.
[01:29:13.741 --> 01:29:15.122]  The mass brainwashing is there.
[01:29:15.662 --> 01:29:17.063]  So then we went up to Sacramento.
[01:29:17.643 --> 01:29:19.324]  We got there early in the afternoon.
[01:29:20.484 --> 01:29:21.985]  Following the map, we drove around.
[01:29:22.725 --> 01:29:30.729]  We ended up in this little neighborhood, kind of a mixed-use industrial neighborhood that has some, you know, kind of like machine shops, some concrete mixing plants and stuff.
[01:29:30.789 --> 01:29:32.770]  And then two streets of houses.
[01:29:33.170 --> 01:29:34.211]  Really nice looking houses.
[01:29:34.831 --> 01:29:36.452]  Middle class looking, you know, yeah.
[01:29:37.172 --> 01:29:40.774]  And then you see a bunch of people walking up this bike path, and we're like, I bet that's where it is.
[01:29:40.834 --> 01:29:41.894]  So we walked up there.
[01:29:41.914 --> 01:29:45.896]  We just took the little camera with us the first time because we weren't sure what kind of reception we would get.
[01:29:46.636 --> 01:29:51.598]  And we walk up, walking around, there's a ton of people up there.
[01:29:51.618 --> 01:29:55.779]  I mean, there really are everywhere, and they've created a little community.
[01:29:57.420 --> 01:30:02.102]  If you guys want to pull up the map now, this might be a good time to show the map that we have.
[01:30:02.862 --> 01:30:06.487]  And, you know, they really did, uh, you can see the numbers on there.
[01:30:06.507 --> 01:30:08.809]  The red sections are areas where there were tents.
[01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:12.093]  Uh, the green car, that's where we would park and walk up.
[01:30:12.654 --> 01:30:17.119]  So there's a first section there called the Snake Pit, which had about 25 people in it, and 25 tents.
[01:30:17.139 --> 01:30:19.082]  Now, we're counting tents, not people.
[01:30:19.642 --> 01:30:20.062]  I don't know.
[01:30:38.974 --> 01:30:44.136]  And the big 85 section, that is the section that even the homeless people, they called it the ghetto.
[01:30:44.176 --> 01:30:45.357]  The other ones that were there.
[01:30:45.957 --> 01:30:50.399]  And they said, don't go in that area at night unless you know somebody or you're with somebody.
[01:30:51.059 --> 01:30:53.981]  And while we were there, there was an actual fire that broke out.
[01:30:54.141 --> 01:30:56.482]  Is it fair to say that's a racial enclave?
[01:30:57.495 --> 01:31:01.258]  Um, we saw mainly a mixture of whites and blacks.
[01:31:02.698 --> 01:31:02.819]  In 85?
[01:31:03.579 --> 01:31:05.160]  Um, yeah, in there.
[01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:10.684]  And then overall, I would say it was more probably 70% white, 30% black.
[01:31:11.224 --> 01:31:11.644]  About that.
[01:31:11.704 --> 01:31:14.326]  And then out of that, maybe another... It was definitely younger.
[01:31:14.626 --> 01:31:17.388]  Yeah, the younger black kids lived in that area.
[01:31:17.728 --> 01:31:19.009]  But there were some white people in there.
[01:31:19.849 --> 01:31:27.253]  And then you go where the star was is a guy that we met he actually was pulling electricity off of the radio tower and he was the only camp there that had electricity.
[01:31:27.293 --> 01:31:30.935]  With permission from the person who owns that plot where the radio tower is.
[01:31:31.255 --> 01:31:34.136]  See there's several corporations that own this area.
[01:31:34.156 --> 01:31:34.997]  It's not all owned by one person.
[01:31:35.017 --> 01:31:36.317]  And they all overlap on top of each other.
[01:31:36.357 --> 01:31:37.198]  There's the railroad.
[01:31:37.898 --> 01:31:42.102]  There is SMUD, which is the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District.
[01:31:42.342 --> 01:31:45.224]  Parks and Recreation.
[01:31:45.244 --> 01:31:47.286]  Parks and Recreation, which own the levee.
[01:31:47.546 --> 01:31:47.766]  Right.
[01:31:48.207 --> 01:31:53.191]  Well, give us the rest of the tour, but then I want to get into them grabbing the kids, grabbing the cars, and that's the key.
[01:31:53.211 --> 01:31:56.674]  And then what happens at this facility they are trying to make them go to?
[01:31:56.954 --> 01:31:57.174]  Right.
[01:31:57.635 --> 01:32:00.957]  So there's a lot of facilities there actually that are there for the homeless.
[01:32:01.778 --> 01:32:07.542]  Right across, you go through the neighborhoods and cross 16th Street and then you have the Loaves and Fishes, the Salvation Army.
[01:32:07.962 --> 01:32:10.564]  The places that are set up, they give these guys a hot meal.
[01:32:10.604 --> 01:32:13.046]  You can see the fish, that's kind of where that area is.
[01:32:13.946 --> 01:32:15.107]  I don't know.
[01:32:34.325 --> 01:32:34.926]  I think so.
[01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:53.161]  Yeah.
[01:32:53.241 --> 01:32:58.886]  It's a very big area, but what they've done is converted a building and a miniature golf course.
[01:32:59.026 --> 01:32:59.306]  Right.
[01:32:59.366 --> 01:33:00.167]  That was also a miniature golf course.
[01:33:00.187 --> 01:33:01.108]  So it's very surreal.
[01:33:01.188 --> 01:33:11.798]  You have this guarded building and palm trees and this miniature golf course and then people funneling in and apparently they're severely searched and controlled.
[01:33:11.898 --> 01:33:12.879]  And they can't keep anything.
[01:33:12.899 --> 01:33:17.563]  They're allowed to bring one bag with them at the bus site where they get picked up.
[01:33:18.939 --> 01:33:21.361]  Park their bicycle in like one other bag of stuff.
[01:33:21.381 --> 01:33:29.789]  So, I mean, if you're going to try to better yourself, I don't see how you can do it owning two bags of articles and a bike and not having any other possessions.
[01:33:30.170 --> 01:33:32.572]  So they're telling him, you can't live out here in the shantytown.
[01:33:32.612 --> 01:33:33.893]  We're going to force you into the camp.
[01:33:34.233 --> 01:33:36.395]  But you're saying the camp only holds 150 people.
[01:33:36.516 --> 01:33:36.756]  Right.
[01:33:36.816 --> 01:33:39.398]  They have to leave at 5 a.m., be there at 3 p.m.
[01:33:39.418 --> 01:33:40.299]  to be bussed in.
[01:33:40.619 --> 01:33:41.801]  They're searchlight prisoners.
[01:33:42.381 --> 01:33:44.302]  And that it's hard to have a job during those hours.
[01:33:44.362 --> 01:33:44.542]  Right.
[01:33:44.622 --> 01:33:47.803]  But then, meanwhile, there's massive harassment of those that do have cars.
[01:33:48.143 --> 01:33:51.364]  They're trying to have a job and save money while they live in the shantytown.
[01:33:51.584 --> 01:33:53.185]  Let's go over the type of stuff they go through.
[01:33:53.625 --> 01:34:04.269]  Well, we met a guy named Jason, and the first night we were there, actually, and we ended up interviewing him three times because, you know, for one reason or another, we thought we could get a better, you know, sound recording of his interview.
[01:34:04.289 --> 01:34:07.070]  Yeah, it's chaotic out there, so it's really hard to get a good recording.
[01:34:07.090 --> 01:34:08.630]  It's really windy, too.
[01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:10.371]  So, Jason, he was
[01:34:11.741 --> 01:34:16.023]  Had some problems and he was living, he bought a Winnebago and had, you know, outfitted it out.
[01:34:16.063 --> 01:34:17.024]  He had lost his job.
[01:34:17.044 --> 01:34:24.007]  He bought it really inexpensively and then was, you know, fixing it up, spending all of his money on getting it running.
[01:34:24.207 --> 01:34:24.467]  Right.
[01:34:24.887 --> 01:34:27.449]  And neglected to get the three, four hundred dollar insurance.
[01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.969]  Right.
[01:34:28.249 --> 01:34:37.033]  And he got pulled over and didn't have insurance, so they pulled him out, they towed it away, and this is a few, about seven months ago or something, six weeks ago, something like that.
[01:34:37.113 --> 01:34:39.875]  It was a few, it was a few weeks before, yeah, in January, that's what it was.
[01:34:40.655 --> 01:34:46.276]  And so that happened to him there, and then I guess he'd gotten some money to go get it out, and they'd already auctioned it off.
[01:34:46.557 --> 01:34:48.617]  So within two weeks, they had sold all of his possessions off.
[01:34:48.637 --> 01:34:49.517]  I know there's laws.
[01:34:49.537 --> 01:34:51.638]  I think you're supposed to have a few months before they do that.
[01:34:51.718 --> 01:34:59.740]  Yeah, I mean, apparently they probably just thought they could pull one over on this guy, and you know, when you don't have a network of anything, it's really easy to get taken advantage of.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:02.322]  And it wasn't just a vehicle that had a few of his things.
[01:35:02.402 --> 01:35:05.065]  I mean, this owner, Vago, had his entire life in it.
[01:35:05.085 --> 01:35:05.245]  Yeah.
[01:35:05.385 --> 01:35:09.409]  He said there were computers, a DVD player, you know, everything that you would have in your home.
[01:35:09.429 --> 01:35:10.490]  And the police wouldn't let him have that?
[01:35:10.651 --> 01:35:11.572]  No, they took it all.
[01:35:12.573 --> 01:35:15.275]  Not only that, they took all of his stuff.
[01:35:15.335 --> 01:35:16.837]  They left him on the side of the road.
[01:35:16.857 --> 01:35:17.417]  Now, start over.
[01:35:17.457 --> 01:35:18.158]  We're taping for the film.
[01:35:18.178 --> 01:35:18.518]  Go ahead.
[01:35:18.538 --> 01:35:18.679]  Okay.
[01:35:19.119 --> 01:35:19.499]  Let's go ahead.
[01:35:21.101 --> 01:35:29.866]  So yeah, we meet Jason and he's telling us his story about, you know, fixing up this Winnebago, being unable to afford the insurance.
[01:35:29.906 --> 01:35:35.850]  So he was driving around, it was about a month after he got it, and driving around without insurance, got pulled over.
[01:35:36.471 --> 01:35:40.193]  The police had this whole rigmarole where, you know, they were playing good cop, bad cop.
[01:35:40.413 --> 01:35:43.875]  One guy was saying, oh yeah, we're not going to tow you away.
[01:35:44.296 --> 01:35:48.578]  And then finally, in the end, it came out that yes, they were going to take all of his stuff.
[01:35:48.638 --> 01:35:49.379]  They were going to
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:51.781]  Well, the reason this is so important
[01:36:19.403 --> 01:36:27.187]  Is that here's a guy who was lower middle class, he gets down on his luck, he tries to get a Winnebago to live in to get a lower grade job and build money back up to get on his feet.
[01:36:27.267 --> 01:36:27.487]  Sure.
[01:36:27.587 --> 01:36:31.209]  This happened to tens of millions of our ancestors, many of them still living in the Great Depression.
[01:36:31.789 --> 01:36:34.851]  Now, Graves of Wrath, that movie's based on real things that happened, it's even worse.
[01:36:35.211 --> 01:36:37.592]  Seven million starved to death according to major university studies.
[01:36:38.153 --> 01:36:40.074]  And that was when 90% of us were self-sufficient.
[01:36:40.954 --> 01:36:42.475]  So a large portion of those that weren't died.
[01:36:43.433 --> 01:36:48.542]  And they wouldn't arrest you for trying to pull off the road or live in the bushes somewhere in a tent as long as you were non-violent.
[01:36:49.283 --> 01:36:52.990]  They did have bonus marchers who'd been living for years in D.C.
[01:36:54.031 --> 01:36:55.193]  that they then sent in.
[01:36:57.006 --> 01:37:03.752]  Eisenhower as a young captain and the colonel, of course, a World War I hero, was MacArthur.
[01:37:03.772 --> 01:37:06.394]  And they wrote him down, shot him, killed him to get rid of that shantytown.
[01:37:07.234 --> 01:37:08.996]  Because they were there saying, we were promised our bonuses.
[01:37:09.016 --> 01:37:10.857]  So this has happened a few times before.
[01:37:10.877 --> 01:37:20.065]  But the issue here is then the police come, grab his home and his equipment, his computers, everything he's got, won't let him have it, and then take it away.
[01:37:20.165 --> 01:37:21.846]  And now he's just completely blown away.
[01:37:22.186 --> 01:37:22.647]  Pretty much.
[01:37:22.847 --> 01:37:24.869]  And he had gone into the shelters.
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:34.268]  With a smile on his face, he was explaining how they search him, and how they wand him down and pat him down, and that it's for his safety, and this and that.
[01:37:34.308 --> 01:37:35.369]  We met another guy who said the same thing.
[01:37:35.389 --> 01:37:38.272]  And to them, being treated like this is completely pedestrian now.
[01:37:38.372 --> 01:37:38.613]  Yeah.
[01:37:38.793 --> 01:37:41.716]  Yeah, they seem to not, you know, they think it's for their safety.
[01:37:41.796 --> 01:37:47.542]  We met another guy, a younger black gentleman, who was getting ready to get on the bus and go there, and we're asking him, you know,
[01:37:48.203 --> 01:37:48.603]  Why do you do it?
[01:37:48.623 --> 01:37:49.424]  He's like, well, it's safe.
[01:37:49.444 --> 01:37:51.666]  He's like, I don't go to that tent city because it's dangerous.
[01:37:51.686 --> 01:37:54.207]  So they've told him that it's dangerous over there.
[01:37:54.247 --> 01:37:58.971]  Meanwhile, we're walking around there at 11, 1130 at night after interviewing people.
[01:37:59.011 --> 01:38:00.592]  And, you know, we never got attacked.
[01:38:00.612 --> 01:38:03.194]  We never got, I never felt threatened in any way while we were there.
[01:38:03.294 --> 01:38:04.915]  Well, statistically, take the Superdome.
[01:38:04.935 --> 01:38:06.476]  They made people high and dry go to it.
[01:38:06.716 --> 01:38:07.036]  Right.
[01:38:07.056 --> 01:38:08.117]  And then didn't give them any aid.
[01:38:08.137 --> 01:38:09.979]  There were rapes and murders because the police stood down.
[01:38:09.999 --> 01:38:13.061]  And as this gets worse and worse, this is going to exacerbate.
[01:38:13.101 --> 01:38:15.743]  Now, guys, I just IMed you a story I want you to put up on screen.
[01:38:17.402 --> 01:38:24.094]  uh... it's a l a times headline because this is separate this is the l a times this weekend
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:43.314]  This is the headline is Ontario residents only at tent city and since they've changed the headline that's where it was a headline about wristbands that's how I was able to pull this up and it says in here they take their children, CPS them, they take their dogs and in this article they take their cars and RVs.
[01:38:43.614 --> 01:38:43.834]  Wow.
[01:38:44.074 --> 01:38:46.076]  And so, yeah, it's in this story.
[01:38:46.096 --> 01:38:47.117]  I'm going to put it up on screen.
[01:38:47.157 --> 01:38:48.798]  So this is happening everywhere.
[01:38:48.838 --> 01:38:50.940]  Specifically, what were the stories you heard about them taking children?
[01:38:52.004 --> 01:39:03.148]  One lady we interviewed the last day we were there, she had her daughter, and you know a lot of this is like kind of afterthought, oh my kids got taken away, and you know, and it was because her mom, they got her mom to testify against her.
[01:39:03.208 --> 01:39:14.372]  Yeah, there's various stories, but the main one that I kept hearing was turning grandparents against their children, and then taking away those, you know, the grandchildren.
[01:39:14.792 --> 01:39:19.274]  Thinking that they're going to get the grandchildren, but then they just end up going into the system.
[01:39:20.384 --> 01:39:30.232]  Well, how that propaganda works, I've noticed in all these different sitcoms and TV shows and dramas, the grandparents call the CPS and they show you on TV every night on different shows.
[01:39:30.352 --> 01:39:31.373]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[01:39:31.854 --> 01:39:33.555]  And that's one microcosm example.
[01:39:33.575 --> 01:39:35.557]  Those Law and Order type shows, they show that.
[01:39:35.817 --> 01:39:40.580]  Exactly like, oh call the police, your neighbor, we saw they had a gun in their house when most places in the country guns aren't illegal.
[01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:42.021]  It's all based in New York or something.
[01:39:42.261 --> 01:39:42.962]  You know, the drama.
[01:39:43.362 --> 01:39:46.644]  And so they think, oh I'm going to get the grandkids, you know, my daughter's a drunk or whatever.
[01:39:47.025 --> 01:39:49.847]  And then, no, no, no, the state's supposedly going to give it to family.
[01:39:49.907 --> 01:39:52.348]  No, they're going to get more money keeping it institutionalized.
[01:39:52.368 --> 01:39:54.670]  So folks need to know, that isn't how this is going to work.
[01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:56.411]  Yeah, they're going to get shammed.
[01:39:56.771 --> 01:40:06.359]  There are at least four or five stories that we talked to with women who they had their kids or they were taken away or their grandkids had been taken away.
[01:40:08.935 --> 01:40:09.696]  It's really sad.
[01:40:09.736 --> 01:40:23.366]  It was a really sad place to be and it's sad because you see these people trying to make a community for themselves and doing the best they have and you know they're just being given the run around and they're really, that area, there's really nothing going on there.
[01:40:23.406 --> 01:40:29.951]  There's no, they're not building, although there was some construction on the back part, but it used to be the city dump back in the twenties and thirties.
[01:40:30.051 --> 01:40:37.697]  And the issue is it's going to get worse and worse and they've announced FEMA camps for the homeless where you'll basically be prisoners.
[01:40:38.537 --> 01:40:40.538]  And, uh, you're not allowed to be on the streets.
[01:40:40.638 --> 01:40:43.040]  So, and when you were in L.A., you said you talked to folks.
[01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:46.001]  Well, there was a shantytown at this park, but now they came and took them away.
[01:40:46.582 --> 01:40:47.722]  And then we have the L.A.
[01:40:47.762 --> 01:40:47.982]  Times.
[01:40:48.002 --> 01:40:50.504]  I want to put it on screen for folks watching.
[01:40:51.124 --> 01:40:53.806]  Uh, you know, Google Ontario residents only at Tent City.
[01:40:53.846 --> 01:40:54.546]  This is the L.A.
[01:40:54.586 --> 01:40:54.866]  Times.
[01:40:54.906 --> 01:40:55.947]  You scroll down to the bottom.
[01:40:57.319 --> 01:40:58.880]  It's a multi-part story.
[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:06.502]  It'll talk about how they take their dogs, take their children, take their cars, and they're using the cars to get to jobs.
[01:41:07.082 --> 01:41:09.263]  Most people had apartments or homes, lost their job.
[01:41:09.523 --> 01:41:13.324]  They're trying to build up money, and they say in here, I'm trying to get back on my feet.
[01:41:13.364 --> 01:41:16.485]  I was a month away from being able to get an apartment, and now I'm destroyed.
[01:41:17.265 --> 01:41:21.291]  See, so it's right there in the article for anybody that wants to go read it.
[01:41:21.311 --> 01:41:23.334]  They're kidnapping their children, they're taking their dogs.
[01:41:23.635 --> 01:41:27.521]  But the key to all of this, you said folks brought this up when you asked them.
[01:41:28.908 --> 01:41:31.209]  And so I want to go back over that now, because this is important.
[01:41:31.670 --> 01:41:33.110]  They're pointing out the illegal aliens.
[01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:34.491]  They cannot have driver's licenses.
[01:41:34.511 --> 01:41:35.572]  They cannot have insurance.
[01:41:35.992 --> 01:41:39.154]  The police are in the news all the time saying, if we arrest them, the judges just let them go.
[01:41:39.414 --> 01:41:41.135]  But they know citizens are in the system.
[01:41:41.475 --> 01:41:42.455]  They'll put up with it.
[01:41:42.976 --> 01:41:48.499]  And so if that was an illegal alien, they wouldn't impound with no insurance that Winnebago.
[01:41:48.619 --> 01:41:49.279]  So talk about that.
[01:41:49.779 --> 01:41:50.019]  Right.
[01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:52.061]  Well, I imagine that
[01:41:53.427 --> 01:42:04.529]  Well they had, let's see who was, one thing we didn't, we did notice is that there were no Hispanics in this, I didn't see any Hispanics, there was a couple non-whites, non-blacks, they were kind of, you know.
[01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:06.130]  And maybe Pacific Islander.
[01:42:06.150 --> 01:42:12.551]  Pacific Islander type, but there was no illegal aliens around and we actually didn't see too many in that area at all.
[01:42:12.691 --> 01:42:15.332]  Well that's because illegal aliens come from a real third world country.
[01:42:16.172 --> 01:42:17.933]  And Americans in a few years will know how to live.
[01:42:17.993 --> 01:42:25.239]  They live in 10-15 to a house, they don't pay any taxes, none of the system, and a lot of them go and get on welfare, so that's why they're driving brand new cars around.
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:27.981]  And then they save enough money to buy houses.
[01:42:28.241 --> 01:42:28.461]  Right.
[01:42:28.641 --> 01:42:29.702]  So they know what they're doing.
[01:42:30.523 --> 01:42:32.024]  But cattle Americans don't.
[01:42:32.064 --> 01:42:32.364]  Stay there.
[01:42:32.384 --> 01:42:39.950]  I want to end the show with this, and then we'll have Part 2 tomorrow or something at the end of the last hour, because I want to fully debrief you guys.
[01:42:39.970 --> 01:42:42.391]  I mean, we sent reporters there to get you a bird's eye view.
[01:42:42.732 --> 01:42:43.572]  We have all this footage.
[01:42:43.632 --> 01:42:45.234]  It's going to be in the new Obama film.
[01:42:45.834 --> 01:42:54.220]  Don't forget Friday, I'm gonna do two hours on the concentration cams, but not just that, how popular mechanics like Lynn Becker are gonna try to debunk it with straw men.
[01:42:55.021 --> 01:43:03.407]  There is growing evidence that Americans would have better health and a lower incidence of cancer and fibrocystic disease of the breast if they consumed more iodine.
[01:43:03.487 --> 01:43:14.195]  Neutriodine iodine is formulated to work with your body to help to stimulate proper hormonal balance and can assist in detoxification from fluoride, bromide, and chloride toxins.
[01:43:14.435 --> 01:43:18.458]  And helps provide protection from radioactive iodine from nuclear fallout.
[01:43:18.618 --> 01:43:23.442]  Nutriodine is made with a proprietary high energy field from pure crystalline iodine.
[01:43:23.542 --> 01:43:26.544]  Nutriodine should be used by all ages every day.
[01:43:26.704 --> 01:43:30.487]  If you suffer from chronic fatigue, low thyroid, and mitochondria function.
[01:43:30.567 --> 01:43:32.808]  Or if you just want to feel better from day to day.
[01:43:32.969 --> 01:43:34.830]  Nutriodine drops are for you.
[01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:36.671]  There are several forms of iodine.
[01:43:36.771 --> 01:43:39.053]  Nutriodine is the only trusted source.
[01:43:39.373 --> 01:43:42.576]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:01.847 --> 01:44:07.188]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:44:07.728 --> 01:44:13.910]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:14.210 --> 01:44:16.030]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:16.190 --> 01:44:18.591]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:44:18.651 --> 01:44:29.533]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:44:31.838 --> 01:44:33.059]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:33.499 --> 01:44:34.900]  It's about a one world government.
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:41.644]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:42.265 --> 01:44:50.050]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:50.530 --> 01:44:51.691]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:52.111 --> 01:44:53.292]  The people strike back.
[01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:58.441]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:44:58.681 --> 01:45:03.003]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[01:45:03.203 --> 01:45:11.086]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:45:11.414 --> 01:45:14.236]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:45:14.516 --> 01:45:22.062]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:45:22.163 --> 01:45:27.727]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:45:27.967 --> 01:45:33.531]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:45:33.811 --> 01:45:37.133]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:45:37.353 --> 01:45:40.715]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:45:40.955 --> 01:45:45.999]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Chief Superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:45:46.019 --> 01:45:48.881]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:45:48.941 --> 01:45:49.121]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:45:57.555 --> 01:45:58.096]  Don't worry.
[01:45:58.536 --> 01:46:00.037]  This show is documented.
[01:46:00.577 --> 01:46:03.360]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:07.883]  Folks, we're almost out of time.
[01:46:07.943 --> 01:46:08.804]  I want you to get a pen and paper.
[01:46:08.824 --> 01:46:10.525]  There's some key info coming up in a moment.
[01:46:12.253 --> 01:46:17.576]  We're going to have to have you guys back here for thirty minutes or so, Mar, to finish telling the whole story of what you saw.
[01:46:17.716 --> 01:46:25.460]  You told me that, without you even having to ask over the phone when I talked to you, that they were acutely aware that illegal aliens didn't get their cars taken, weren't under the same rules.
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:26.001]  Right.
[01:46:26.601 --> 01:46:27.902]  We spoke with a couple people.
[01:46:28.342 --> 01:46:32.884]  One guy, his name was Tigger, and then there was a lady named Cece, and that was about the same time.
[01:46:34.205 --> 01:46:37.847]  They had a little rant about how they had seen
[01:46:39.708 --> 01:46:40.068]  We're good to go.
[01:46:56.539 --> 01:47:01.081]  His name was Axel, who had been out there homeless for about 13 years or so.
[01:47:01.881 --> 01:47:05.463]  He was acutely aware of the New World Order and the banking system.
[01:47:06.623 --> 01:47:09.304]  He sounded like one of your listeners, but he had never heard of you.
[01:47:10.245 --> 01:47:11.185]  He was aware of everything.
[01:47:11.405 --> 01:47:15.287]  He was even telling us, you know, get rid of your 401k, buy gold and silver.
[01:47:16.567 --> 01:47:17.127]  He was cool enough.
[01:47:17.207 --> 01:47:18.648]  But you said he still liked Obama.
[01:47:20.749 --> 01:47:27.351]  He's like, I think Obama can do a good job, I think he's going to save us, but then he would go, but he lies about everything.
[01:47:27.411 --> 01:47:30.432]  And then he would point out the things that he had done wrong.
[01:47:30.492 --> 01:47:34.393]  He would point out all the lies that Obama... And then the same breath, but I still hope, I still hope.
[01:47:34.733 --> 01:47:39.234]  Yeah, they still hope, because I think that's the one thing that they have on... You guys did a fabulous job.
[01:47:39.294 --> 01:47:41.155]  I'm going to have you back on at least for 30 minutes tomorrow.
[01:47:41.215 --> 01:47:41.895]  Thank you.
[01:47:42.856 --> 01:47:44.896]  We'll write an article about this that will have everything.
[01:47:44.916 --> 01:47:47.617]  It'll be like the expose five page article.
[01:47:47.697 --> 01:47:49.039]  Yeah, well a lot of folks aren't worried about it.
[01:47:49.299 --> 01:47:49.880]  That's not me.
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:51.582]  Folks, when they do the least of us, they do all of us.
[01:47:51.622 --> 01:47:53.284]  I tell you what, it's the future.
[01:47:53.425 --> 01:47:55.928]  The tent cities is where a lot of us are going to end up.
[01:47:57.719 --> 01:47:59.179]  Know your neighbor, that's all I can say.
[01:47:59.259 --> 01:48:00.180]  Yeah, it's community.
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:01.920]  Absolutely, my God.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.560]  Family, that's why they've broken up family, because that's the unit that would say it.
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:07.041]  The Hispanics have that, so they're not in the 10 cities.
[01:48:07.361 --> 01:48:09.001]  And that's why the establishment leaves them alone.
[01:48:09.382 --> 01:48:11.082]  Okay, we're almost out of time.
[01:48:11.122 --> 01:48:16.623]  We've got this big FEMA camp, plastic coffin story, breaking news, up on Infowars.com the next 10-15 minutes.
[01:48:16.643 --> 01:48:18.103]  We couldn't get it up by the end of the show.
[01:48:18.683 --> 01:48:19.384]  But look for that.
[01:48:19.404 --> 01:48:25.225]  I covered the Queen, Obama bowing to her, them treating him like crap, even CNN admitted, get out of there!
[01:48:26.125 --> 01:48:26.625]  We're good to go.
[01:48:42.995 --> 01:48:44.335]  They are devaluing the dollar.
[01:48:44.355 --> 01:48:45.596]  They've announced they're going to kill it.
[01:48:45.916 --> 01:48:46.896]  Global currency.
[01:48:46.996 --> 01:48:54.697]  Folks, you are insane if you don't put some of your liquid assets, stocks, bonds, 401Ks, and gold and silver, and physically hold it.
[01:48:54.737 --> 01:48:57.198]  The news is admitting you should do it now, but saying buy gold stocks.
[01:48:57.738 --> 01:48:58.418]  Whatever, folks.
[01:48:58.438 --> 01:48:59.839]  You want to physically hold it.
[01:49:00.079 --> 01:49:01.779]  Ted's got an incredible deal today.
[01:49:01.839 --> 01:49:03.059]  Ted, tell folks the deal you've got.
[01:49:03.319 --> 01:49:06.540]  Yeah, right now what I have, again, I've got the British Sovereigns at 272.
[01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:08.640]  I've got the Franks at 218.
[01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:10.561]  Gold has been up as high as 935 today.
[01:49:12.499 --> 01:49:20.845]  Obviously with the protests and everything that's going on in that G20, you know, Russia calling for gold as a back, you know, for the world currency.
[01:49:20.865 --> 01:49:24.288]  I mean, there's a lot of things, a lot of reasons to be getting away from the U.S.
[01:49:24.328 --> 01:49:24.688]  dollar.
[01:49:25.148 --> 01:49:27.270]  But yeah, right now we have the Franks at $8.69.
[01:49:28.010 --> 01:49:30.692]  I've got a real good supply of U.S.
[01:49:30.772 --> 01:49:31.773]  Eagles now, finally.
[01:49:31.853 --> 01:49:34.294]  I've got some of these Panda coins.
[01:49:34.415 --> 01:49:36.316]  I have Pamp Swiss bars.
[01:49:36.917 --> 01:49:45.340]  I was really able to pick up a good quantity of items here when the things were dipping down there at right around that $9.10 to $9.16 level.
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:50.541]  And I really encourage people to get involved now because, Al, it's just too much trouble.
[01:49:50.601 --> 01:49:51.121]  Call us at 800-686-9000.
[01:49:54.072 --> 01:49:54.913]  2-2-3-7.
[01:49:54.973 --> 01:49:55.554]  Again, it's 800-686-2237.
[01:49:55.634 --> 01:49:59.378]  They really should be getting involved.
[01:49:59.438 --> 01:50:02.161]  And folks, I procrastinate, you procrastinate.
[01:50:02.922 --> 01:50:09.809]  I've got to have some money in the bank to run this office that I'm always killing, but they can implode any time and they're openly announcing they're going to hyperinflate and devalue.
[01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:12.391]  I mean, this is serious times we're coming into.
[01:50:12.471 --> 01:50:13.392]  Get gold and silver.
[01:50:13.712 --> 01:50:14.272]  Get prepared.
[01:50:14.332 --> 01:50:15.833]  Modest Resources, the best deals.
[01:50:16.114 --> 01:50:18.015]  Those deals he just offered are insanely good.
[01:50:18.035 --> 01:50:18.415]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:50:18.455 --> 01:50:23.039]  And they'll be there, the brokers, until midnight tonight.
[01:50:23.079 --> 01:50:25.301]  Give them a call.
[01:50:25.321 --> 01:50:25.561]  800-686-237.
[01:50:25.801 --> 01:50:26.902]  Ted Anderson, thank you so much.
[01:50:27.062 --> 01:50:27.642]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:50:27.963 --> 01:50:28.223]  You bet.
[01:50:28.243 --> 01:50:29.664]  Alright, we're out of here in five seconds.
[01:50:29.764 --> 01:50:30.965]  Retransmission starts now.
[01:50:31.305 --> 01:50:32.326]  Powerful first hour.
[01:50:32.406 --> 01:50:33.327]  Infowars.com.
[01:50:33.347 --> 01:50:33.867]  God bless you.
[01:50:35.788 --> 01:50:37.530]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:50:39.309 --> 01:50:41.590]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:44.372 --> 01:50:45.953]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:46.073 --> 01:50:50.735]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:50.815 --> 01:50:53.577]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:50:53.777 --> 01:50:56.638]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:50:56.818 --> 01:51:01.541]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:51:01.761 --> 01:51:02.702]  If you simply prepare.
[01:51:02.902 --> 01:51:05.905]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:06.125 --> 01:51:13.031]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:51:13.151 --> 01:51:16.254]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:51:16.414 --> 01:51:17.956]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
