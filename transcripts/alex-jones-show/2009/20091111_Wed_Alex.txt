[00:00:01.263 --> 00:00:01.904]  Big Brother.
[00:00:02.584 --> 00:00:03.625]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:04.346 --> 00:00:05.426]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:06.107 --> 00:00:06.908]  You want answers?
[00:00:07.688 --> 00:00:08.609]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:12.933]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:17.496]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.902 --> 00:00:28.587]  We are now simulcasting the syndicated radio broadcast at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:29.187 --> 00:00:44.483]  Dr. Sherry Timpenny is coming up later in the hour, into the next hour, to break down what's happening with the flu inoculations and fresh off two debates she's had here in Austin, visiting with us from her home state of Pennsylvania.
[00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:48.225]  Coming up, I'm going to be playing a video clip.
[00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:54.388]  Fox admits to planting political brainwashing in popular TV shows.
[00:00:54.888 --> 00:01:00.711]  This is an article written by Paul Watson back in March of this year, 2009.
[00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:11.956]  News Corp put out a video where they brag that they're pushing global warming propaganda.
[00:01:13.661 --> 00:01:21.208]  Separately though, in a few of News Corp's holdings, they are always claiming they're anti-man-made global warming and believe it's a hoax.
[00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:31.817]  But then at key points, these neocon publications come out and announce to everyone that
[00:01:35.086 --> 00:01:38.107]  Don't worry, the legislation isn't going to pass.
[00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:44.409]  They told us that the healthcare legislation, the government takeover of Obamacare wasn't going to pass the House, it passed.
[00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:50.811]  They told us, don't worry, cap and trade, tax every facet of your life, federal control, no judicial review.
[00:01:52.301 --> 00:01:56.104]  Taxes on all energy, taxes on meat, taxes on farms.
[00:01:56.725 --> 00:01:58.286]  Don't worry, that's not going to pass the House.
[00:01:58.406 --> 00:01:58.887]  It passed.
[00:01:59.527 --> 00:02:05.472]  And I've seen a bunch of articles put out by the New York Post that Rupert Murdoch owns, Fox News, you name it.
[00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:11.818]  British newspapers he owns, Australian papers he owns, saying don't worry, it's not going to pass.
[00:02:12.818 --> 00:02:16.582]  And in foreign papers, he's pushing that it's real and that we need it.
[00:02:17.372 --> 00:02:21.435]  But to get us to stand down and not think that there's a threat, he's telling us it's not going to pass.
[00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:30.862]  Well, the problem with that is Harry Reid, the head of the Senate, has put a health care bill on Senate calendar.
[00:02:32.743 --> 00:02:35.685]  He's filed the motion to introduce the bill on Monday, November 16th.
[00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:42.430]  Anticipating a Republican objection, the bill will be pushed onto the Senate calendar.
[00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:43.591]  Forced by him.
[00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:53.256]  And so they are going to attempt to pass this the 17th, 18th, and 19th of this month.
[00:02:53.717 --> 00:02:59.378]  We are only talking about six days away that they are going to launch this out of committee.
[00:03:00.058 --> 00:03:04.919]  And they're also talking about simultaneously in a week or two weeks trying to pass.
[00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:05.939]  It's already passed the House.
[00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:07.040]  All this has passed the House.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.420]  It passes the Senate.
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.021]  If it passes the Senate, it's done.
[00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:18.525]  And the neocons are saying all over radio, all over TV, don't worry, we've won.
[00:03:18.545 --> 00:03:20.226]  And they're telling everybody to stand down.
[00:03:20.546 --> 00:03:29.252]  A month ago, Schwarzenegger came out and said, I'm not going to sign the bill in California, making you thumbprint and register to buy ammo.
[00:03:30.033 --> 00:03:33.175]  And I told everybody, I said, he's anti-gun, he's going to sign the bill next week.
[00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:33.835]  He signed it.
[00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:39.359]  He didn't want opposition, and he knows that people are barely paying attention to media, so they hear that
[00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:43.490]  Oh, Schwarzenegger said he wasn't for that, but then he signs it.
[00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.250]  They're manipulating you.
[00:03:45.511 --> 00:03:47.431]  They're going off the same playbook.
[00:03:48.051 --> 00:03:51.253]  There is a very good chance that all of this is going to pass.
[00:03:52.893 --> 00:04:06.078]  And somehow we've got to get the word out grassroots to call the Senate, to call all the Senators that are on the fence about this, to call the couple of Democrats that are on the fence, and some of the Republicans that are on the fence, because they will have a narrow victory.
[00:04:06.812 --> 00:04:07.152]  Right now.
[00:04:25.788 --> 00:04:27.069]  We can beat this.
[00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.951]  And ladies and gentlemen, this is so important.
[00:04:28.971 --> 00:04:30.813]  This is economic warfare against our country.
[00:04:31.113 --> 00:04:32.214]  We have got to beat this.
[00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:36.198]  And here is a clip put out by Fox themselves.
[00:04:36.218 --> 00:04:46.328]  There's a bunch of other clips that people put together showing what they're doing from Fox TV, Fox movies, where Rupert Murdoch is bragging that he's trying to manipulate the news.
[00:04:46.368 --> 00:04:48.790]  He said last year at Davos, he's trying to manipulate people.
[00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.712]  So all of his holdings
[00:04:51.923 --> 00:04:54.926]  The TV, the movies are pushing it's good.
[00:04:55.727 --> 00:04:58.789]  Except for Fox News, they're saying it's bad, but don't worry, we beat it.
[00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.854]  This is why having a Judas goat in amongst us is so important at key times.
[00:05:04.274 --> 00:05:13.082]  Rupert Murdoch has spent tens of millions of his own money pushing this global carbon tax that will give an elite group of bankers total control over our economy.
[00:05:13.523 --> 00:05:14.604]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:26.944]  I want to set an example to others in our industry and other industries that no matter what the size of your carbon footprint is, you can make a difference.
[00:05:27.265 --> 00:05:28.385]  That's April on record.
[00:05:28.405 --> 00:05:30.166]  Global warming.
[00:05:30.467 --> 00:05:31.007]  Probably.
[00:05:31.307 --> 00:05:35.570]  Press button to see what global warming will do in the next three years.
[00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:39.792]  Three years is a long ways away.
[00:05:40.272 --> 00:05:44.475]  What could we do on a practical level to start making a difference?
[00:05:45.275 --> 00:05:46.136]  Just had another thought.
[00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:51.850]  What if the Scared Straight Show had a green message to the biggest thing you've done?
[00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:52.290]  You know what?
[00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.731]  Stop it.
[00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:55.831]  Back up to the start.
[00:05:56.011 --> 00:05:58.412]  You know, I meant to play this and not comment, but I have to.
[00:05:58.812 --> 00:05:59.612]  This was put out in 2006.
[00:06:00.632 --> 00:06:02.053]  We wrote about it in March of this year.
[00:06:02.453 --> 00:06:04.353]  And they put out other promos.
[00:06:04.493 --> 00:06:05.813]  News Corp put this out.
[00:06:06.954 --> 00:06:07.894]  They want you to know
[00:06:09.315 --> 00:06:10.916]  And the NFL says it's real.
[00:06:11.056 --> 00:06:14.357]  All the big hype machines are telling you global warming's real.
[00:06:14.377 --> 00:06:21.060]  In 2006, they were saying the Earth will flood and New York, everyone will die, the Simpsons, in three years.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.860]  See, they had it timed up to 2009.
[00:06:23.441 --> 00:06:24.301]  They meant to pass it.
[00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:25.601]  They've been saying this for many years.
[00:06:26.062 --> 00:06:28.222]  This is the year they want to ram it all through.
[00:06:28.883 --> 00:06:31.864]  So again, for radio listeners that are just listening, you can go to
[00:06:34.192 --> 00:06:38.115]  PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:06:38.756 --> 00:06:41.698]  And you can go to the story if you want to watch this video clip.
[00:06:42.038 --> 00:06:45.301]  Fox admits to planning political brainwashing in popular TV shows.
[00:06:46.062 --> 00:06:47.082]  Go there and watch it.
[00:06:47.122 --> 00:06:48.103]  It's even more powerful.
[00:06:48.123 --> 00:06:51.726]  But again, these are TV shows and media clips with implanted messages.
[00:06:52.026 --> 00:06:55.089]  Rupert Murdoch is bragging that he's brainwashing people.
[00:06:55.109 --> 00:07:00.313]  And we have clips of him as well separately at News Corp press conferences admitting this.
[00:07:00.333 --> 00:07:01.154]  But here it is.
[00:07:01.174 --> 00:07:02.655]  I'm not going to stop at this time.
[00:07:02.935 --> 00:07:03.616]  From the start,
[00:07:04.116 --> 00:07:10.582]  This is your champion, Fox News Corp, The Conservatives, stabbing you in the back.
[00:07:11.062 --> 00:07:11.503]  Here it is.
[00:07:11.523 --> 00:07:27.357]  I want to set an example to others in our industry and other industries that no matter what the size of your carbon footprint is, you can make a difference.
[00:07:27.658 --> 00:07:28.759]  Out of state for long record.
[00:07:29.813 --> 00:07:30.573]  Global warming.
[00:07:30.854 --> 00:07:31.374]  Probably.
[00:07:31.394 --> 00:07:35.977]  Press button to see what global warming will do in the next three years.
[00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:40.319]  Three years is a long ways away.
[00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:44.862]  What could we do on a practical level to start making a difference?
[00:07:45.642 --> 00:07:46.583]  Just had another thought.
[00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:51.022]  What if the Scared Straight Show had a green message to it?
[00:07:51.223 --> 00:07:59.151]  The biggest thing we've done is inserting messages about the environment into some of our content.
[00:07:59.371 --> 00:07:59.992]  I don't follow.
[00:08:00.693 --> 00:08:02.955]  Green, it means environmentally friendly.
[00:08:03.055 --> 00:08:10.425]  The lifeblood of our company is the quality of our TV shows and we would accomplish nothing if we compromise that quality.
[00:08:10.525 --> 00:08:13.529]  Going green doesn't fit with the rest of the show.
[00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.312]  We're working magic, make it fit.
[00:08:15.572 --> 00:08:19.398]  Hey Brian, I'm not going to recycle this aluminum can, I'm just going to throw it in the trash.
[00:08:22.622 --> 00:08:44.808]  The most powerful way that we could communicate the commitment on behalf of our company was to change the practices within the production, as well as work in a message about global warming, about environmental changes, and about empowering people to take responsibility.
[00:08:45.088 --> 00:08:47.069]  Why are your wedding programs bumpy?
[00:08:49.068 --> 00:08:56.494]  We're having a green wedding, so after the reception our guests can plant the programs, grow flowers.
[00:08:57.114 --> 00:08:59.736]  I could live in the sea and make friends with a whale.
[00:09:00.136 --> 00:09:01.717]  We'd live in a sunken pirate ship.
[00:09:02.338 --> 00:09:03.519]  That'd show global warming.
[00:09:03.979 --> 00:09:08.242]  We've come up with all sorts of strategies for lessening our footprint.
[00:09:08.382 --> 00:09:13.546]  Everything from utilizing hybrid vehicles on our production.
[00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:15.087]  Look at all these Hummers.
[00:09:15.348 --> 00:09:16.989]  What kind of jerk would drive one of those?
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.401]  Dude, this car kicks ass!
[00:09:22.944 --> 00:09:24.485]  Yeah, Rumsfeld!
[00:09:24.645 --> 00:09:29.450]  We're using biodiesel fuel in our generators instead of regular diesel.
[00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.291]  No car, no electricity.
[00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:32.933]  Car for me?
[00:09:33.894 --> 00:09:35.515]  I got a zero car, let's put it there.
[00:09:36.004 --> 00:09:39.987]  We're now frequently getting scripts electronically.
[00:09:40.267 --> 00:09:42.288]  Fluorescent bulbs that use less electricity.
[00:09:42.588 --> 00:09:44.269]  Reusable hemp bags for shopping.
[00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.451]  Shampoo that's not tested on animals.
[00:09:47.011 --> 00:09:53.315]  I feel bad for those lab animals running around with dirty hair, but the better for the environment, that's the sacrifice they have to make.
[00:09:54.178 --> 00:09:57.959]  Here at 24, we are committed to reducing our impact on climate change.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.081]  Now, we know that we can't solve this problem in 24 hours.
[00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:06.102]  But by making energy-conscious decisions on our set, we are contributing to a solution.
[00:10:06.743 --> 00:10:15.706]  Galvanizing that kind of an effort with as many people as it has taken to get on board and sort of help us with this effort, it hasn't been difficult.
[00:10:15.806 --> 00:10:21.108]  On the contrary, it's been rewarding and people have acted swiftly and enthusiastically.
[00:10:21.724 --> 00:10:22.965]  He's powering the blender.
[00:10:23.345 --> 00:10:25.466]  The wheel rim is attached to a generator.
[00:10:25.506 --> 00:10:26.906]  This is rather ingenious.
[00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:28.587]  Stay fit and save energy.
[00:10:28.607 --> 00:10:30.868]  If everyone should do this, I'm sure it'll catch on.
[00:10:31.128 --> 00:10:37.791]  Mr. McKay says that history is past, but saving the Earth is our present to the future.
[00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:38.431]  Oh.
[00:10:39.051 --> 00:10:47.681]  The fact that this company decided to get behind the move to try to bring an end to global warming was really gratifying.
[00:10:47.961 --> 00:10:52.786]  Finally, I get to save the Earth with deadly lasers instead of deadly slide shows.
[00:10:52.806 --> 00:10:54.128]  Aww, isn't that sweet?
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:10.444]  Now every other major corporation is all behind this because they're owned by the private central banks that you will openly pay taxes on thousands of products directly to them.
[00:11:10.764 --> 00:11:16.026]  But more importantly, unelected boards will be able to shut down any businesses, any corporations.
[00:11:16.446 --> 00:11:18.407]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[00:11:18.687 --> 00:11:20.047]  We have the carbon tax bill.
[00:11:20.087 --> 00:11:21.408]  We have the carbon tax treaty.
[00:11:22.296 --> 00:11:29.401]  It gives unlimited dictatorial power to unelected private groups like the WTO, the IMF, the World Bank.
[00:11:30.161 --> 00:11:32.283]  Al Gore is your hero saving the earth.
[00:11:32.663 --> 00:11:35.445]  Already made a billion bucks off this and they're just getting started.
[00:11:36.145 --> 00:11:42.169]  That's why Rupert Murdoch has all his fake conservative publications telling you health care isn't going to pass.
[00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.533]  And telling you the cap and trade isn't going to pass.
[00:11:45.573 --> 00:11:47.014]  They told you it wouldn't pass the House.
[00:11:47.335 --> 00:11:48.095]  It's all passed.
[00:11:48.336 --> 00:11:50.158]  They told you it wouldn't go to the floor of the Senate.
[00:11:50.478 --> 00:11:52.480]  It's now all going to the floor of the Senate.
[00:11:53.441 --> 00:11:54.182]  This is close.
[00:11:56.553 --> 00:11:58.575]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:11:58.735 --> 00:11:59.476]  Spy on me?
[00:11:59.596 --> 00:11:59.876]  Yeah.
[00:11:59.916 --> 00:12:04.820]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.421]  You should use StartPage instead.
[00:12:06.582 --> 00:12:07.242]  StartPage?
[00:12:07.322 --> 00:12:08.743]  Yeah, StartPage.com.
[00:12:08.844 --> 00:12:11.666]  The new name for XQuick, the world's most private search engine.
[00:12:11.806 --> 00:12:15.529]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:12:15.689 --> 00:12:18.552]  Plus, StartPage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:12:18.792 --> 00:12:21.154]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the Internet.
[00:12:21.434 --> 00:12:22.895]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:12:23.015 --> 00:12:23.235]  Right!
[00:12:23.315 --> 00:12:26.318]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:12:26.618 --> 00:12:27.158]  Hello, folks.
[00:12:27.198 --> 00:12:28.159]  This is Alex Jones.

[00:13:56.368 --> 00:13:56.708]  Good day.
[00:13:56.909 --> 00:13:58.410]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:59.050]  November 11, 2009.
[00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.011]  Gold opened this morning at $11,1680.
[00:14:00.051 --> 00:14:03.414]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $11,4730, $5,7365 for a half-ounce, or $2,8682 for a quarter-ounce.
[00:14:03.434 --> 00:14:03.895]  That's $11,4730, $5,7365, or $2,8682.
[00:14:16.405 --> 00:14:29.937]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[00:14:30.037 --> 00:14:38.664]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:14:38.864 --> 00:14:39.825]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:14:39.965 --> 00:14:44.109]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[00:14:44.309 --> 00:14:45.270]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:46.590]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.971]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:14:47.051 --> 00:14:47.491]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:05.021]  We're good.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.683]  Ready Reserve Foods is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[00:15:25.123 --> 00:15:30.247]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:15:30.607 --> 00:15:34.930]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you're buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.272]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:15:37.612 --> 00:15:40.554]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you free of charge.
[00:15:41.034 --> 00:15:41.334]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[00:15:41.354 --> 00:15:41.414]  1-800-453-2202.
[00:15:41.434 --> 00:15:43.196]  Or visit our website at readyreservefoods.com.
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.342]  Factory Direct.
[00:15:50.582 --> 00:15:52.606]  Wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:15:52.806 --> 00:15:53.507]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[00:16:03.834 --> 00:16:18.987]  We've got a surprise guest with us in this segment, maybe a little bit in the next, because Sherry Tenpenny is set to arrive in the next 10-15 minutes, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, here in Austin, fighting the folks trying to have forced flu vaccinations.
[00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:23.431]  Medical doctor Sherry Tenpenny coming up later in this hour and into the next hour.
[00:16:23.451 --> 00:16:30.937]  I just played clips of Fox News, Fox TV, bragging that they're trying to brainwash people for the global carbon tax.
[00:16:31.934 --> 00:16:37.377]  And George Humphrey, who's in my film Fall of the Republic, I just saw his car drive up.
[00:16:37.457 --> 00:16:41.319]  He lives here in Austin, former city councilman, economist, good friend of mine.
[00:16:41.359 --> 00:16:43.300]  He's in Obama Deception and Fall of the Republic.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.041]  He pulled up right as we were going live.
[00:16:45.101 --> 00:16:47.543]  I said, why not sit him down for a segment or two?
[00:16:47.583 --> 00:16:50.464]  And I said, what do you think of Fall of the Republic?
[00:16:50.604 --> 00:16:54.527]  And George Humphrey, who's in the film, give us your take on this, and I want your truthful take.
[00:16:54.907 --> 00:16:56.948]  What do you think of this film compared to the Obama Deception?
[00:16:57.188 --> 00:17:03.632]  Well, it's hard for me to be totally objective because I'm in it, but I think it's the best thing you've ever done.
[00:17:03.652 --> 00:17:06.354]  The Obama deception was awesome.
[00:17:07.394 --> 00:17:10.336]  I think you've had over six or seven million hits on it.
[00:17:10.816 --> 00:17:12.798]  I think this is going to be even bigger.
[00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:13.738]  It's cleaner.
[00:17:13.758 --> 00:17:15.639]  The production values are better.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.721]  It's right up to date.
[00:17:18.001 --> 00:17:20.803]  And Alex, I am so honored.
[00:17:21.963 --> 00:17:29.089]  I am so honored to be your friend, because I consider you one of the top patriots this nation has ever had.
[00:17:29.189 --> 00:17:29.649]  I truly do.
[00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:30.370]  Well, you're a sweetheart.
[00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:31.651]  I consider you a top patriot.
[00:17:31.691 --> 00:17:35.253]  Well, thank you very much, and I accept that wholeheartedly.
[00:17:35.674 --> 00:17:42.259]  And we're going to continue to do it, because this country, this country is far, far too good to kick it away.
[00:17:42.379 --> 00:17:46.002]  And right now, if we, the people who are listening to this right now,
[00:17:46.582 --> 00:18:10.250]  If we don't get activated, if we don't help stop this sick care program, if we don't stop this carbon tax, if we don't stop the lies, if we don't stop the increased selling of our jobs to foreign countries, the destruction of our dollar, the bailouts, all of this stuff, it is all preconceived to destroy this wonderful, beautiful republic.
[00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:11.890]  And now there's no longer any doubt.
[00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:16.171]  They openly are announcing everywhere, the end of America, total carbon tax.
[00:18:16.191 --> 00:18:21.052]  They're saying, we won't turn the liquidity back on the banks, who we gave this fiat power to.
[00:18:21.092 --> 00:18:23.293]  It's a bunch of Madoffs and Ken Lay types.
[00:18:24.313 --> 00:18:26.094]  In fact, they came up with the plan themselves.
[00:18:26.234 --> 00:18:28.434]  If we don't go along with this, they're going to kill the economy.
[00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:29.994]  They're already killing the economy.
[00:18:30.014 --> 00:18:31.275]  They want zero growth.
[00:18:31.335 --> 00:18:32.315]  They want negative growth.
[00:18:32.515 --> 00:18:33.475]  They want a monopoly.
[00:18:33.795 --> 00:18:37.056]  What is this cap and trade and government takeover of health care really about, George?
[00:18:37.136 --> 00:18:38.897]  Well, it's all about a transfer of power.
[00:18:38.937 --> 00:18:43.378]  It has nothing to do with taking care of the people of this country.
[00:18:43.418 --> 00:18:45.939]  It has nothing to do with honesty.
[00:18:45.979 --> 00:18:47.660]  It has nothing to do with health.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:56.503]  It is 17% of the economy is going to be transferred to the control of the federal government.
[00:18:57.043 --> 00:19:10.639]  It is sick care, it is completely status quo, it is absolutely selling out to Big Pharma, the hospital corporations, segments of the AMA and the insurance companies.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.220]  I don't know.
[00:19:31.389 --> 00:19:39.880]  I mean, they're using flat-out lies against us and I'm now on the White House enemies list and George Soros has opened fire on me every day in his publications.
[00:19:40.581 --> 00:19:41.201]  What does that say?
[00:19:41.241 --> 00:19:42.123]  It means we can beat him.
[00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:43.543]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:43.923 --> 00:19:51.291]  You know, the thing about it is, the truth moves very, very slowly and lies and innuendo and hate move very quickly.
[00:19:52.032 --> 00:19:55.716]  And the lies and innuendo are moving like mad dogs right now.
[00:19:56.377 --> 00:20:02.303]  And even though you speak with a very harsh voice at times, is that you speak the truth.
[00:20:02.944 --> 00:20:04.306]  And the truth is coming out.
[00:20:04.406 --> 00:20:11.037]  And remember 17, 18 years ago when we were talking about this, when we were a handful of about 15 people.
[00:20:11.077 --> 00:20:13.200]  Yeah, I knew you before I even went on local TV.
[00:20:14.001 --> 00:20:16.325]  When I was running around trying to get Pat Buchanan elected.
[00:20:17.085 --> 00:20:22.087]  And we were down, 17, 18 years ago, we were down and we would say, the New World Order.
[00:20:22.447 --> 00:20:35.591]  And people would get, and now, wherever I go, I was just buying some flowers at a local place here, and several people, not one or two, but several people came up and said, aren't you George Humphrey, and weren't you in the fall of the Republic?
[00:20:35.631 --> 00:20:36.471]  And I went, wow.
[00:20:37.071 --> 00:20:37.971]  Yeah, thanks.
[00:20:38.271 --> 00:20:38.752]  That's cool.
[00:20:38.772 --> 00:20:41.172]  So it's been out two weeks and you're already running into people on the street.
[00:20:41.192 --> 00:20:51.675]  Yeah, and these are people I didn't know, and clearly Austin is the center of the positive revolution, the return of... Isn't that crazy?
[00:20:51.695 --> 00:20:54.196]  Because all over the world, mainstream media says we are the center.
[00:20:55.797 --> 00:21:11.255]  People are moving here in all different forms, whether it's for politics or economics, but there are more and more people who are coming here for their spiritual upliftment too, because as you and I both know, this is not just an economic or a political or a cultural battle.
[00:21:11.735 --> 00:21:13.797]  It is a time of spiritual choice.
[00:21:14.338 --> 00:21:16.759]  And each and every one of us has to make a decision.
[00:21:16.879 --> 00:21:24.783]  Are we going to hold on to the old paradigm of separation consciousness and fear and domination, which is going to take us to total chaos?
[00:21:25.204 --> 00:21:35.969]  Or are we going to change our lives to unity consciousness, more love, cooperation, working with others, but also self-sufficiency and bravery in a stiff backbone?
[00:21:36.329 --> 00:21:37.730]  That's the new paradigm.
[00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.670]  We got a break.
[00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:40.832]  I want to come back and talk about the globalist agenda.
[00:21:40.852 --> 00:21:42.413]  They're moving on every front right now.
[00:21:42.733 --> 00:21:44.134]  They're trying to sew things up.
[00:21:44.154 --> 00:21:44.874]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:46.856 --> 00:21:47.756]  We're on the march.
[00:21:48.257 --> 00:21:49.838]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:50.778 --> 00:21:53.460]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:56.069 --> 00:22:02.913]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:22:03.033 --> 00:22:04.994]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:22:05.134 --> 00:22:07.255]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:22:07.376 --> 00:22:08.896]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:22:09.016 --> 00:22:13.339]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:00.003]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:23:00.323 --> 00:23:00.924]  Number one.
[00:23:01.224 --> 00:23:04.366]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:23:04.647 --> 00:23:05.227]  Number two.
[00:23:05.507 --> 00:23:10.071]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:23:10.411 --> 00:23:10.871]  It's true.
[00:23:11.151 --> 00:23:15.715]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:23:16.015 --> 00:23:16.575]  Number three.
[00:23:16.856 --> 00:23:20.138]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:23:20.438 --> 00:23:24.141]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:23:24.341 --> 00:23:24.882]  Number four.
[00:23:25.122 --> 00:23:27.504]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:23:27.885 --> 00:23:31.288]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:23:31.569 --> 00:23:32.129]  Number five.
[00:23:32.369 --> 00:23:36.294]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:23:36.514 --> 00:23:41.279]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:23:41.559 --> 00:23:45.585]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:23:45.725 --> 00:23:47.308]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:24:26.164 --> 00:24:28.225]  And it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:24:28.465 --> 00:24:30.286]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:24:30.546 --> 00:24:31.927]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:24:32.287 --> 00:24:34.548]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:24:34.828 --> 00:24:39.190]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:24:39.551 --> 00:24:42.932]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.

[00:24:46.375 --> 00:24:47.802]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:24:48.264 --> 00:24:48.947]  One last time.
[00:24:49.309 --> 00:24:50.515]  It's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:25:01.946 --> 00:25:05.909]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, the 11th day of November on this Wednesday edition, 2009.
[00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:15.455]  George Humphrey, economist, former Austin City Council member, documentary filmmaker, best-selling author, is in studio with us for another five minutes.
[00:25:15.515 --> 00:25:17.256]  I'm going to play a few-minute clip
[00:25:17.816 --> 00:25:27.898]  From the intro to my interview with Governor Jesse Ventura, as he gave us an exclusive look into his new TV show, Conspiracy Theory, that comes from our perspective to air on TruTV.
[00:25:28.198 --> 00:25:28.918]  I'm a consultant.
[00:25:29.338 --> 00:25:30.519]  I'm in some of the episodes.
[00:25:30.619 --> 00:25:32.899]  It's very, very exciting, and it looks like it's going to be a good piece.
[00:25:33.499 --> 00:25:35.120]  It premieres December 2nd.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.281]  We'll also have open phones with Dr. Sherry Tinpenny coming up, but five more minutes with George Humphrey, since he happened to drop by.
[00:25:41.221 --> 00:25:44.044]  Before we go to that tape and then we're going to come back live with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[00:25:44.785 --> 00:25:46.306]  You were going to finish up because you're an economist.
[00:25:46.527 --> 00:25:46.667]  Yeah.
[00:25:47.027 --> 00:25:48.088]  You're Info of the Republic.
[00:25:48.489 --> 00:25:51.872]  I should add, everybody needs to get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:25:51.892 --> 00:25:54.795]  You're authorized to make copies for not-for-sale purposes.
[00:25:55.255 --> 00:25:58.679]  I have to say that or people then take it and say it's their right to sell it and I can't sell it.
[00:25:58.959 --> 00:26:01.540]  We even had that happen on Amazon in places, and they get mad.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.741]  We're only going to sell your stuff.
[00:26:02.781 --> 00:26:03.641]  You can't sell your own stuff.
[00:26:03.901 --> 00:26:06.022]  The point is, we also need your support.
[00:26:06.422 --> 00:26:11.664]  So again, InfoWars.com, the online video bookstore shopping cart, or call toll-free to get Fall of the Republic.
[00:26:11.905 --> 00:26:17.687]  You can get it in a combo pack with Reflections and Warnings, which is really good, with the late, great Aaron Russo.
[00:26:17.707 --> 00:26:20.988]  The last video interview he did, it's a documentary, incredible revelations.
[00:26:21.008 --> 00:26:24.270]  You can get that free while supplies last, because we're running out of them.
[00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:25.050]  This is
[00:26:48.991 --> 00:26:50.792]  Carbon credits, carbon rationing.
[00:26:51.012 --> 00:26:53.493]  You'll have to get government authorization to be able to fly.
[00:26:53.853 --> 00:26:55.074]  That's openly being announced.
[00:26:55.114 --> 00:26:57.415]  People are really waking up now because this is all happening.
[00:26:57.735 --> 00:27:00.477]  But as an economist, I have the health care bill.
[00:27:00.497 --> 00:27:01.717]  I've read the subsections here.
[00:27:02.198 --> 00:27:05.479]  The close to 2,000, it's 1,960 something pages.
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:11.642]  It says five years in prison, quarter million dollar fine if you don't buy insurance.
[00:27:11.702 --> 00:27:12.643]  So forget just take it.
[00:27:13.003 --> 00:27:14.984]  And they take 2.5 to 5% depending on your pay grade.
[00:27:19.632 --> 00:27:27.016]  2.5 to 5% is taken out of your check, this is in the bill, and for the uninsured, and you're forced to buy insurance.
[00:27:27.717 --> 00:27:35.321]  So this is a massive new tax to the bankers as an economist who's predicted everything that's happening right now, a top economist and a successful businessman.
[00:27:35.701 --> 00:27:37.502]  What will this health care plan really do?
[00:27:37.782 --> 00:27:42.664]  Well, first of all, it hasn't passed the Senate, and I'm sure there's going to be huge changes.
[00:27:42.744 --> 00:27:56.808]  But as it stands now, Pelosi's bill, according to one of the top guys I talked to, he's neither Democrat or Republican, he says that for a family of four making $100,000, it's going to cost that family $20,000 a year as the bill stands right now.
[00:28:03.717 --> 00:28:04.817]  Now that's impossible.
[00:28:05.217 --> 00:28:20.320]  A family of four, even though $100,000 is a lot of money, a family of four, when they pay their mortgage, when they pay their car payments, when they pay their gas and electric and their phone and they send Johnny and Susie to school and they go to the Starbucks, they don't have anything left.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:31.103]  As a matter of fact, starting about seven years ago, the first time in the history of America, the average family in the United States is now spending more and has more debt than they have assets.
[00:28:33.051 --> 00:28:36.652]  $20,000 as the bill stands right now.
[00:28:37.052 --> 00:28:41.013]  Now clearly, clearly, clearly the Senate's going to change this thing.
[00:28:41.193 --> 00:28:42.514]  It's going to get moved around.
[00:28:43.014 --> 00:28:49.276]  But the people of this country have to understand this is a status quo sick care bill.
[00:28:50.036 --> 00:28:51.916]  It supports Big Pharma.
[00:28:52.576 --> 00:28:54.857]  It supports the hospital corporations.
[00:28:55.357 --> 00:28:59.478]  It supports segments of the AMA and of the insurance company.
[00:28:59.878 --> 00:29:01.299]  Does it support you and me?
[00:29:02.359 --> 00:29:02.499]  No.
[00:29:10.475 --> 00:29:13.337]  Healthcare bill is a bailout to insurance companies.
[00:29:13.797 --> 00:29:18.560]  And then he wrote another editorial Monday titled, Why I Voted Against the Bill.
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:23.643]  And he's a socialist, but I respect him because he'll speak out against government-sponsored terror.
[00:29:23.663 --> 00:29:24.423]  He's a good man.
[00:29:24.864 --> 00:29:30.827]  I disagree with his political system and his ideas on economics, but I really respect Dennis because he's the real deal.
[00:29:30.907 --> 00:29:33.129]  And he said, look, this isn't socialism.
[00:29:33.149 --> 00:29:34.770]  You know, when Newsweek says we're all socialists.
[00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:38.392]  Now, Bull, the insurance companies, in fact, I have the Wall Street Journal right here,
[00:29:39.304 --> 00:29:46.081]  The insurance companies here is the spokesman for the insurance companies admitting in this article from the Wall Street Journal
[00:29:47.017 --> 00:29:48.979]  That they actually wrote the bill.
[00:29:49.019 --> 00:29:49.880]  They want penalties.
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.361]  They want to make you get this.
[00:29:51.421 --> 00:29:52.823]  It gives them liability protection.
[00:29:52.863 --> 00:29:58.648]  But they come out and act like they're actually against it, just like News Corp is actually for the global greenhouse tax.
[00:29:58.688 --> 00:29:59.068]  Absolutely.
[00:29:59.088 --> 00:29:59.469]  Of course.
[00:29:59.749 --> 00:30:01.891]  So again, there's all sorts of baiting and switching here.
[00:30:02.131 --> 00:30:05.054]  And every time we say we're against this, oh, you're against cap and trade.
[00:30:05.074 --> 00:30:06.115]  You work for the oil companies.
[00:30:06.335 --> 00:30:07.476]  They're funding cap and trade.
[00:30:07.877 --> 00:30:09.198]  Oh, you're against the health care bill.
[00:30:09.218 --> 00:30:10.419]  You're working for the insurance companies.
[00:30:10.459 --> 00:30:12.041]  You know, I work for Alex Jones and that's it.
[00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:15.663]  You know, the fact is, this is not about health.
[00:30:16.083 --> 00:30:18.985]  This is about a transfer of power.
[00:30:19.005 --> 00:30:33.013]  17% of the gross national product of the whole economy is going to be transferred from the private sector, which isn't working right now, but to the federal sector, which is going to be an absolute train wreck.
[00:30:33.073 --> 00:30:37.696]  This is about the grabbing of power, the taking of your rights.
[00:30:37.836 --> 00:30:39.517]  And friends, the only way it's going to stop
[00:30:40.157 --> 00:30:50.279]  is when the people who are listening to this get themselves fully educated, listen to Alex, watch Fall of the Republic, and then go talk to your friends, and then start beating the pans.
[00:30:50.339 --> 00:30:55.020]  It's time to stop being secret and whispering about this stuff.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.781]  It's time to start talking about it everywhere you go.
[00:30:59.141 --> 00:31:04.182]  In the grocery stores, at the coffee houses, at your club, on your runs, at church.
[00:31:04.802 --> 00:31:07.163]  Everybody you know you need to speak to
[00:31:07.423 --> 00:31:10.032]  You're right, George, because they're making their move right now.
[00:31:10.053 --> 00:31:11.598]  I mean, go back to October.
[00:31:13.055 --> 00:31:14.776]  Here's an amazing statistic.
[00:31:14.816 --> 00:31:16.897]  In the last six months, in the last hundred working days,
[00:31:42.907 --> 00:31:53.015]  In the United States, Goldman Sachs, through the carry trade, has made over a hundred million dollars per day in the reverse carry trade.
[00:31:53.075 --> 00:31:54.736]  Just on manipulating dollars?
[00:31:54.976 --> 00:31:56.057]  In manipulating dollars.
[00:31:56.377 --> 00:31:58.779]  It used to be the Japanese carry trade here.
[00:31:59.059 --> 00:32:10.548]  What we've done now is reverse it and the big guys, Goldman Sachs, mostly through investments in Brazil and some of the other countries, they are making a hundred million dollars a day.
[00:32:10.648 --> 00:32:11.569]  Off the death of the dollar?
[00:32:11.929 --> 00:32:13.291]  Off the death of the dollar.
[00:32:13.371 --> 00:32:15.152]  And they're saying the Arabs are killing the dollar.
[00:32:15.192 --> 00:32:18.816]  The Arabs, the Chinese, the Russians, they're all begging us not to do this.
[00:32:19.076 --> 00:32:20.277]  They hold all the dollars.
[00:32:20.478 --> 00:32:22.119]  But the media is killing the dollar.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.803]  The banks are killing it and then blaming it on the Iranians.
[00:32:26.644 --> 00:32:28.386]  No, the enemy is the Federal Reserve.
[00:32:28.466 --> 00:32:29.286]  They are the culprit.
[00:32:29.306 --> 00:32:31.268]  The enemy is inside the walls.
[00:32:32.376 --> 00:32:32.476]  And
[00:33:02.376 --> 00:33:02.836]  Exactly.
[00:33:02.896 --> 00:33:05.577]  That's why people ask why I'm so upset.
[00:33:06.057 --> 00:33:09.477]  Folks, if I caught somebody robbing my car in my yard, I'd get upset.
[00:33:09.518 --> 00:33:13.018]  This is a government organized tyranny taking over my life.
[00:33:13.978 --> 00:33:14.959]  These are bad people.
[00:33:14.999 --> 00:33:20.040]  They want to force eugenics and control and inoculations through a medical tyranny.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:31.302]  Goldman Sachs, because they can borrow directly from the Treasury, is taking money at less than one half of one percent and then able to go out and buy the reserves
[00:33:31.722 --> 00:33:32.943]  All the way around the world.
[00:33:32.963 --> 00:33:38.028]  Well did you see that McClatchy series of investigative reports we had him on last Friday?
[00:33:38.308 --> 00:33:39.749]  This top investigative journalist.
[00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:44.574]  They got the internal documents where Goldman Sachs planned the implosion of the housing market.
[00:33:44.934 --> 00:33:50.119]  They sold all these housing stocks while betting against them to destroy their competition.
[00:33:50.359 --> 00:33:52.160]  I mean this is a cold-blooded group.
[00:33:52.541 --> 00:33:53.302]  Of course it is.
[00:33:53.502 --> 00:33:55.864]  And notice their people are all the top federal regulators.
[00:33:56.766 --> 00:33:57.086]  Of course.
[00:33:57.747 --> 00:34:02.849]  And you point that out very, very, very clearly in Fall of the Republic.
[00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:05.531]  And friends, this thing is so much bigger.
[00:34:05.731 --> 00:34:08.453]  And there's one other point that I would like to make before I go.
[00:34:08.773 --> 00:34:15.897]  The United States has transported several nuclear bunker-busting bombs over to Israel.
[00:34:16.377 --> 00:34:22.841]  And there are plans right now for either an American or an American-Israeli or an Israeli attack on Iran.
[00:34:23.741 --> 00:34:28.703]  And the RAND Corporation says the globalists need World War III to get their New World Order.
[00:34:28.923 --> 00:34:34.826]  Friends, this would be the most destabilizing event in the history of our lives.
[00:34:35.266 --> 00:34:41.928]  If we go in and nuke Iran, and I am not a friend of the Iranian government, I think that they're loony tunes.
[00:34:42.068 --> 00:34:44.409]  Yeah, but the globalists want to have order out of chaos.
[00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:45.270]  Of course they do.
[00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:52.673]  And right now, if you put together Russia, China, India, and Iran, and maybe Brazil and some of the others,
[00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:57.533]  Is that the destabilization to this country is unbelievable.
[00:34:57.573 --> 00:34:59.655]  They want World War III in Central Asia.
[00:34:59.835 --> 00:35:00.716]  Absolutely they do.
[00:35:00.756 --> 00:35:03.698]  And all you have to do is read Brzezinski's book.
[00:35:03.818 --> 00:35:04.699]  Yeah, they admit it all.
[00:35:04.739 --> 00:35:05.459]  They admit it all.
[00:35:05.499 --> 00:35:10.583]  The geopolitical master strategists are all public about this.
[00:35:11.023 --> 00:35:16.988]  And friends, all of these things, whether it's political, economic, environmental, all these things,
[00:35:17.269 --> 00:35:20.579]  All we're doing is asking you to wake up right now.
[00:35:20.679 --> 00:35:23.448]  If you care about this country, you have to make a choice.
[00:35:24.284 --> 00:35:30.366]  Either you can go along with the status quo and hideout, and if you do that, your country and your family are doomed.
[00:35:30.666 --> 00:35:31.666]  George, last question.
[00:35:31.766 --> 00:35:32.006]  Why?
[00:35:32.026 --> 00:35:33.626]  I mean, I have my perspective.
[00:35:33.726 --> 00:35:43.929]  Why are they openly announcing world government, openly announcing the carbon tax after decades of denying it and planning in our mind it didn't exist, giving people that compulsion that it isn't real?
[00:35:44.429 --> 00:35:46.109]  Now they come out and admit everything.
[00:35:46.149 --> 00:35:47.570]  I mean, that means they're really making their move.
[00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:53.637]  First of all, they're arrogant, and from their point of view, they have all their bases covered.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:04.444]  There is so much going on, and I would suggest that everybody watch this television show called V, that's the big hit.
[00:36:05.065 --> 00:36:09.327]  And friends, there's a lot more going on with that show than you may understand.
[00:36:09.347 --> 00:36:11.529]  They're throwing it in your face, what Obama's doing.
[00:36:11.549 --> 00:36:12.749]  It's revelation of the method.
[00:36:12.769 --> 00:36:21.635]  It's all about Obama, it's all about world government, it's all about them telling us what they're going to do, which they have to do, which is part of their sick
[00:36:22.755 --> 00:36:24.235]  That's their game.
[00:36:24.295 --> 00:36:29.617]  And notice the aliens, we're not saying it's really aliens, it's the archetype, are going to suck all our resources.
[00:36:29.657 --> 00:36:29.997]  Of course.
[00:36:30.037 --> 00:36:34.918]  Cap and trade is about shutting everything off to us, training us that we're saving the earth.
[00:36:34.938 --> 00:36:38.518]  I mean, these people are saying, oh, V's exposing Obama.
[00:36:38.759 --> 00:36:39.019]  No!
[00:36:39.219 --> 00:36:41.059]  They're telling you what they're doing.
[00:36:41.279 --> 00:36:43.960]  Just like when I talk about the New World Order, they go, you mean Hulk Hogan.
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:49.821]  Now when I talk about a global elite shutting off our resources to exterminate us, they go, oh, you mean V. George,
[00:36:50.501 --> 00:36:51.261]  Talk to the producer.
[00:36:51.301 --> 00:36:52.302]  How long are you going to be in Austin?
[00:36:52.322 --> 00:36:54.062]  I'm going to be here for about another 10-12 days.
[00:36:54.442 --> 00:36:57.043]  Why don't we set you up right now for a full hour sometime next week?
[00:36:57.063 --> 00:36:57.464]  I'd love to.
[00:36:57.564 --> 00:36:58.524]  I love being here, Alex.
[00:36:58.604 --> 00:36:59.584]  George, awesome having you.
[00:36:59.604 --> 00:37:00.105]  You are awesome.
[00:37:00.165 --> 00:37:01.585]  I love you and have a great show.
[00:37:01.745 --> 00:37:02.125]  Thank you.
[00:37:02.165 --> 00:37:02.585]  Love you too.
[00:37:02.726 --> 00:37:03.626]  Okay, folks.
[00:37:03.646 --> 00:37:05.146]  He's a big part of Fall of the Republic.
[00:37:05.226 --> 00:37:06.167]  Get the DVD.
[00:37:06.187 --> 00:37:06.987]  Get it out to everybody.
[00:37:07.007 --> 00:37:07.967]  This thing is powerful.
[00:37:07.987 --> 00:37:09.068]  It exposes their agenda.
[00:37:09.548 --> 00:37:10.949]  And you hear the buzz is great on the street.
[00:37:10.969 --> 00:37:14.173]  We're going to play a few minutes of Jesse Ventura from our interview yesterday.
[00:37:14.193 --> 00:37:18.837]  And then we're going to come live in studio with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[00:37:19.358 --> 00:37:19.858]  Stay with us.
[00:37:19.998 --> 00:37:20.579]  We'll be right back.
[00:37:22.506 --> 00:37:29.109]  Well, we're into our number two simulcasting the syndicated radio transmission at PrisonPlanet.TV and Living Color.
[00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:41.036]  Joining us from Minnesota, he's about to travel down to Mexico to do some surfing, is former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, of course a star of films like
[00:37:41.556 --> 00:37:44.939]  The Running Man, Predator, and many other films.
[00:37:45.439 --> 00:37:49.062]  He's hosted a MSNBC national television show.
[00:37:49.742 --> 00:37:51.684]  He's hosted NFL football.
[00:37:52.084 --> 00:37:53.865]  There's not much this guy hadn't done.
[00:37:54.266 --> 00:37:55.807]  And now he's got a huge show.
[00:37:55.847 --> 00:37:58.049]  They're saying it's going to be their big push in the winter.
[00:37:58.369 --> 00:37:59.890]  Their big number one promoted show.
[00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:01.731]  And I'm seeing that now in the media.
[00:38:02.692 --> 00:38:05.554]  That's Conspiracy Theory, created by Jesse Ventura.
[00:38:05.975 --> 00:38:07.015]  I'm a consultant on it.
[00:38:07.075 --> 00:38:08.136]  I'm in some of the episodes.
[00:38:08.176 --> 00:38:10.178]  I'm very honored to be involved in it.
[00:38:10.598 --> 00:38:13.701]  And to give you the inside scoop, he starts the media blitz tomorrow.
[00:38:14.161 --> 00:38:17.904]  To give you the inside scoop, is Jesse Ventura with us for the next hour.
[00:38:17.944 --> 00:38:21.947]  We may twist his arm a little bit in the next hour to take some phone calls, but we'll see.
[00:38:22.368 --> 00:38:24.089]  Governor, it is good to have you here with us.
[00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:26.091]  Hi Alex, great to be here again.
[00:38:28.593 --> 00:38:30.795]  I guess I should call you Huggy Bear.
[00:38:33.703 --> 00:38:35.404]  And I'll explain that for a moment.
[00:38:35.464 --> 00:38:37.364]  No, Alex has been good enough.
[00:38:37.424 --> 00:38:42.486]  He appears in a couple of the episodes of Conspiracy Theory that we did.
[00:38:42.586 --> 00:38:52.649]  And so, because he's the only really reoccurring character we've ever had in the first initial bite, we went back to the old Starsky and Hutch show.
[00:38:52.809 --> 00:38:54.730]  And you all remember Huggy Bear, don't you?
[00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:57.711]  The guy that always brought the information to Starsky and Hutch?
[00:38:58.051 --> 00:39:00.631]  Well, that's you now, Alex.
[00:39:00.692 --> 00:39:01.852]  So you're our Huggy Bear.
[00:39:03.154 --> 00:39:04.935]  Well, I'm honored to be your huggy bear.
[00:39:06.475 --> 00:39:08.856]  You've not been able to talk about the show till now.
[00:39:08.896 --> 00:39:10.476]  They've unleashed you.
[00:39:10.516 --> 00:39:14.178]  You barely talked about it on Larry King Live last week.
[00:39:14.738 --> 00:39:24.161]  But now you've been given the green light to give people a foretaste or an idea of what's going to be in the seven episodes.
[00:39:24.481 --> 00:39:25.921]  And so we're all ears, Governor.
[00:39:25.941 --> 00:39:27.342]  I mean, tell us about some of the episodes.
[00:39:27.662 --> 00:39:40.096]  Well, first of all, when I went on Larry, it was because, you know, it was election night and Larry truly wanted my opinion on the latest off-year elections, which I'll do this right now.
[00:39:40.736 --> 00:39:43.399]  To me, why do they even have off-year elections?
[00:39:43.479 --> 00:39:45.562]  It's hard enough to get people out there to vote.
[00:39:46.182 --> 00:39:46.903]  We're good to go.
[00:40:13.762 --> 00:40:14.903]  We're good to go.
[00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:31.511]  Hold on, we're about to go to break and I don't want to stop you.
[00:40:31.531 --> 00:40:47.438]  I want you to have free flow and go over as much as you can tell us about the episodes because I've consulted some but I still only have a few pieces of the overall puzzle and I know that you've stated that you believe this is fair and from our perspective probably the first television show ever that's actually from
[00:40:48.078 --> 00:40:49.620]  People who questions perspective.
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:53.686]  That doesn't mean that you or I or anybody buys all of what's being said out there.
[00:40:53.746 --> 00:40:56.210]  So I want to talk about that when we come back in just a minute.
[00:40:56.250 --> 00:41:04.061]  But in the one minute we've got, what is your take on Republicans sweeping all over the country and Obama's plunging approval rating?
[00:41:04.676 --> 00:41:08.220]  Well, I don't think it's so much Republicans sweeping.
[00:41:08.901 --> 00:41:10.623]  You know they lost that congress.
[00:41:11.143 --> 00:41:12.665]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:12.685 --> 00:41:19.092]  When we come back after this quick break, Dr. Sherri Tenpenny is our guest in studio for this hour and the rest of the next hour.
[00:41:19.112 --> 00:41:20.073]  She's hopping on a plane.
[00:41:20.573 --> 00:41:21.554]  Why is she in Austin?
[00:41:21.594 --> 00:41:24.418]  She's been having a health department debate at the University of Texas.
[00:41:24.898 --> 00:41:26.139]  Was at another event today.
[00:41:26.159 --> 00:41:27.680]  We'll give you the inside scoop.
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:35.504]  The latest flu developments from the number one person out there fighting the vaccines and exposing a medical doctor, Sherry Tenpenny.
[00:41:35.764 --> 00:41:40.367]  Before I break, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio broadcast.
[00:41:41.027 --> 00:41:41.487]  Possible.
[00:41:41.568 --> 00:41:44.290]  One of them is eFoodsDirect, eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:48.133]  This is the longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation.
[00:41:48.173 --> 00:41:49.935]  It's non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[00:41:50.095 --> 00:41:52.838]  It's all grown right here in the U.S., all recently packed.
[00:41:53.038 --> 00:41:54.819]  Their bananas are from outside the U.S., that's it.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.043]  And you're not buying ten-year-old stuff or year-old stuff or six-month-old stuff.
[00:41:59.063 --> 00:42:00.585]  They pack it constantly.
[00:42:00.605 --> 00:42:04.068]  The J. Michael Stevens Group, the website is eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:42:04.408 --> 00:42:06.630]  With all the crazy talk of war and depression,
[00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:07.290]  We're good to go.
[00:42:28.166 --> 00:42:35.949]  We're going to come back and go to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny here in studio and cover all the big developments with the flu and her debate.
[00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:39.331]  It almost didn't happen because they couldn't find anybody to debate her.
[00:42:40.071 --> 00:42:44.473]  So that is coming up after this quick break.
[00:42:45.053 --> 00:42:48.695]  And the websites of course are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:42:48.935 --> 00:42:49.415]  Stay with us.
[00:42:56.376 --> 00:42:58.017]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[00:42:58.137 --> 00:42:59.598]  Say no to toxic overload.
[00:42:59.658 --> 00:43:00.759]  Say no to chemicals.
[00:43:00.979 --> 00:43:02.800]  Say yes to Liquid Zeolite.

[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:04.385]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:44:04.625 --> 00:44:06.028]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:44:06.747 --> 00:44:09.408]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:09.428 --> 00:44:15.609]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:44:15.809 --> 00:44:20.810]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:30.972]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:44:31.092 --> 00:44:33.194]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:44:33.434 --> 00:44:34.755]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:35.035 --> 00:44:37.297]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:37.477 --> 00:44:39.338]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:44:39.618 --> 00:44:44.422]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:44:44.762 --> 00:44:49.546]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:45:01.238 --> 00:45:04.701]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OveTheField.com.
[00:45:07.807 --> 00:45:10.848]  What people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:45:11.188 --> 00:45:15.109]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[00:45:15.289 --> 00:45:19.210]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:21.851]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[00:45:22.111 --> 00:45:23.031]  It was empowering.
[00:45:23.151 --> 00:45:27.032]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[00:45:27.132 --> 00:45:29.933]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[00:45:29.953 --> 00:45:32.714]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[00:45:32.814 --> 00:45:33.574]  Thank you so much.
[00:45:33.794 --> 00:45:36.595]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[00:45:36.635 --> 00:45:37.155]  Thanks again.
[00:45:37.395 --> 00:45:40.038]  Knowledge is power, and that power brings peace.
[00:45:40.779 --> 00:45:43.783]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:45:44.183 --> 00:45:47.567]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[00:45:47.767 --> 00:45:52.132]  You can order online for you and your loved ones or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[00:46:03.573 --> 00:46:06.016]  Okay, I'm going to clear the call board for the next talent.
[00:46:06.477 --> 00:46:11.323]  Sorry to folks holding, but only vaccine questions for Dr. Sherry Timpenny.
[00:46:11.583 --> 00:46:14.947]  Coming up in Studio 1-800-259-9231.
[00:46:16.189 --> 00:46:18.552]  DrTimpenny.com is one of her great websites.
[00:46:18.572 --> 00:46:20.574]  She's a best-selling author, medical doctor.
[00:46:21.255 --> 00:46:22.576]  She really needs no introduction.
[00:46:22.616 --> 00:46:31.699]  For over a decade, she's been one of the main voices out there, eloquently, in a focused way, even on mainstream television and radio, exposing what's happening with the vaccines.
[00:46:32.359 --> 00:46:35.721]  And here to tell us why she's in Austin is Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[00:46:35.761 --> 00:46:36.421]  It's great to have you.
[00:46:36.741 --> 00:46:38.822]  Thanks Alex, it's a pleasure to be here.
[00:46:38.862 --> 00:46:40.383]  We had a really fun meeting last night.
[00:46:40.563 --> 00:46:47.507]  It was sponsored by the University of Texas, the Libertarian Party, and a big group of people who actually said it was just great to have there.
[00:46:47.527 --> 00:46:56.733]  We had, to my knowledge, this is the first time ever that a public health department official, who is a Region 7 official, agreed to debate in a public forum
[00:46:57.193 --> 00:47:00.775]  The pro and con side of vaccines and particularly vaccine mandates.
[00:47:01.295 --> 00:47:02.716]  So it was a really good meeting.
[00:47:02.756 --> 00:47:03.696]  There were a lot of people there.
[00:47:03.736 --> 00:47:05.177]  There was phenomenal questions.
[00:47:05.677 --> 00:47:07.418]  It was kind of a controlled forum.
[00:47:07.458 --> 00:47:14.201]  I mean, there was a set of questions that we had ahead of time that we were able to put together answers for.
[00:47:14.542 --> 00:47:15.922]  Then there were some spontaneous questions.
[00:47:15.962 --> 00:47:19.804]  And then we had an hour of interviews of questions from the audience that were really good.
[00:47:19.824 --> 00:47:23.366]  In fact, we probably could have stayed there another hour just asking all the questions.
[00:47:23.786 --> 00:47:26.630]  And the health department officials, they were really kind of backed against the wall.
[00:47:26.771 --> 00:47:37.547]  Not necessarily in a bad way, but a way that they really, for the first time, I think, really heard people say that vaccines are not safe, they are not effective, they don't protect you, and yes, they do cause harm.
[00:47:38.052 --> 00:47:41.113]  Well, two weeks ago we had the Dallas County Health Department head on.
[00:47:41.213 --> 00:47:44.815]  He said, yes, the inserts say it can give you Guillain-Barre or other neurological disorders.
[00:47:45.115 --> 00:47:46.976]  Yes, it can sterilize your fertility.
[00:47:47.216 --> 00:47:48.817]  Yes, it can cause autoimmune disease.
[00:47:49.097 --> 00:47:50.218]  Yes, it has mercury in it.
[00:47:50.498 --> 00:47:52.699]  Yes, the nasal is live and can spread it.
[00:47:53.199 --> 00:47:56.881]  And I had people calling and freaking out going, we thought you were just saying this, Alex.
[00:47:57.241 --> 00:47:58.582]  No, it's in the inserts.
[00:47:59.082 --> 00:48:01.223]  The health department heads will actually admit this.
[00:48:02.103 --> 00:48:08.129]  But then the schools and the federal government are handing out fake info sheets, as you know, saying none of this is true.
[00:48:08.149 --> 00:48:16.477]  I think that backfired on them because now people actually ask for the real drug insert and they're going, whoa, I didn't know this was going on.
[00:48:16.557 --> 00:48:19.380]  So it does seem that they've ignored us in the past.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.862]  Now they're being forced to come down off their mountain.
[00:48:22.583 --> 00:48:26.605]  Because doctors in Europe, doctors in Germany, doctors here, nurses are refusing to take it.
[00:48:27.146 --> 00:48:32.109]  Am I right in saying, because you're right at the center of this Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, that this is really blowing up in their face.
[00:48:32.169 --> 00:48:39.373]  They tried this offensive to set the precedent for forced inoculation and for this hoax, this panic, and it's blown up in their face.
[00:48:39.733 --> 00:48:40.153]  I agree.
[00:48:40.353 --> 00:48:40.713]  I agree.
[00:48:40.794 --> 00:48:42.474]  And I think that we've done several things.
[00:48:43.455 --> 00:48:50.638]  One of the other websites that I have that I'm a co-developer of is a website that's pandemicfluonline.com.
[00:48:50.678 --> 00:48:52.619]  It's pandemicfluonline.com.
[00:48:52.999 --> 00:48:57.721]  And one of the things that we did that I think really made a difference was that we gave people tools.
[00:48:57.981 --> 00:49:01.244]  You know, we're always telling people to get busy, get out, get active, do things.
[00:49:01.664 --> 00:49:12.494]  And so what we did on this website was we gave people downloadable flyers, downloadable PowerPoint presentations, downloadable things that they could start back in August handing things out because we knew it was coming.
[00:49:12.794 --> 00:49:15.236]  We knew it was coming from, it's the annual flu shot every year.
[00:49:15.256 --> 00:49:20.921]  We knew the swine flu stuff was coming this year and thousands and thousands of people were handling those things out.
[00:49:21.221 --> 00:49:22.922]  And I think that they were really taken back.
[00:49:23.002 --> 00:49:25.604]  I think they were blown back by the response that people have had.
[00:49:25.924 --> 00:49:29.947]  So the work that you did, the work that we've done, I think has really made a difference this time around.
[00:49:30.027 --> 00:49:38.333]  And by the way, I've seen major British newspapers with the health heads saying extremists, terrorists are handing out flyers.
[00:49:38.573 --> 00:49:39.674]  They're all over London.
[00:49:40.094 --> 00:49:44.157]  And I think a lot of listeners saw the success of our Obama Joker poster making hundreds of
[00:49:47.639 --> 00:49:55.243]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:49:55.583 --> 00:50:02.427]  I think that people don't realize that, you know, if they just take those flyers and they do things like, I have a whole stack of them in the back of my car.
[00:50:02.747 --> 00:50:05.608]  When I go into the mall, I just take them with me and I just hand them out to people.
[00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:07.730]  I don't even try to engage a conversation.
[00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:13.713]  I just say, here's some information I think you may want to look at and just hand it and you never know whose hands that that might end up in.
[00:50:14.093 --> 00:50:20.274]  I've gone to little community workshops where they've printed out all these flyers and they have them there and they're handing them out to all sorts of people.
[00:50:20.714 --> 00:50:22.615]  So people are really taking charge.
[00:50:23.195 --> 00:50:26.595]  We had a big long conversation about this last night at the health department.
[00:50:26.635 --> 00:50:27.076]  Stay there.
[00:50:27.156 --> 00:50:31.296]  Back in 70 seconds with the fourth and final hour with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[00:50:31.316 --> 00:50:32.537]  We'll give you all the websites.
[00:50:33.457 --> 00:50:34.017]  Stay with us.
[00:50:37.698 --> 00:50:39.078]  Thank you for listening to GCS.
[00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:50.713]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:50:51.073 --> 00:50:54.075]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:50:54.315 --> 00:50:59.099]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:50:59.119 --> 00:51:05.424]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:51:05.524 --> 00:51:07.746]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:51:08.266 --> 00:51:08.567]  Tim Geithner?
[00:51:08.587 --> 00:51:09.007]  Bernanke?
[00:51:09.087 --> 00:51:09.688]  They're arsonists!
[00:51:09.768 --> 00:51:11.030]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:13.293]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:29.012]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:51:29.312 --> 00:51:34.196]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:51:34.456 --> 00:51:44.405]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:48.929 --> 00:51:50.851]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:51.311 --> 00:51:54.074]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:09.926 --> 00:52:30.761]  Well, medical doctor, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, an osteopathic medical doctor from Cleveland, Ohio, board certification in emergency medicine and osteopathic manual medicine at her integrative medical clinic focused on allergy elimination, including treatment of children with asthma and allergies at Women's Health using bioidentical hormones and breast
[00:52:32.303 --> 00:52:36.926]  Thermography, her clinic has restored the health of patients who have come from 38 states and 8 countries.
[00:52:36.946 --> 00:52:43.211]  And it goes on, she's the executive director of the, well, I mean, you tell us your bio, because you've done so much.
[00:52:43.231 --> 00:52:47.854]  You were probably the leading person in the last decade exposing vaccines.
[00:52:48.174 --> 00:52:49.495]  You had a big debate last night.
[00:52:49.535 --> 00:52:50.436]  I want to get into that.
[00:52:50.556 --> 00:52:58.682]  I want to just sit back and let you tell the listeners the latest developments with the flu, the forced inoculations in public schools they've been caught doing, and then saying, oops, we messed up.
[00:52:59.362 --> 00:53:01.284]  The rebellion by doctors worldwide.
[00:53:02.364 --> 00:53:06.987]  It looks like this flu scam has really stalled, dead in its tracks.
[00:53:07.488 --> 00:53:08.949]  Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, you've got the floor.
[00:53:09.696 --> 00:53:13.478]  One of the things that we did was we created tools for people to get out and get active.
[00:53:13.799 --> 00:53:19.302]  We created flyers and small PowerPoint presentations, and we put them on our website, pandemicfluonline.com.
[00:53:19.582 --> 00:53:22.064]  They're also on dr10penny.com, which is my website.
[00:53:22.424 --> 00:53:25.125]  And we've done just an amazing amount of things to get people active.
[00:53:25.446 --> 00:53:31.909]  And I think that there's more people that are asking questions and are being part of what's happening right now than ever before.
[00:53:31.929 --> 00:53:37.533]  I mean, 10 years ago, when we started talking about all these things that had to do with vaccines, there was barely a voice.
[00:53:37.593 --> 00:53:38.954]  There was hardly anybody listening.
[00:53:39.454 --> 00:53:43.017]  And now what they're doing is more and more people are getting involved.
[00:53:43.037 --> 00:53:44.078]  People are asking questions.
[00:53:44.138 --> 00:53:45.079]  People are saying no.
[00:53:45.359 --> 00:53:46.720]  People are challenging their doctors.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:50.063]  They're finding out that they don't need a pediatrician if they have healthy children.
[00:53:50.103 --> 00:53:56.549]  They can find other types of health care practitioners to help them stay well and stay out of the vaccination lines.
[00:53:57.876 --> 00:54:09.662]  Going back to April, and I had said in January they're going to stage some flu hype because I saw the federal government in FEMA getting ready with local police departments saying get ready for mass graves, a big pandemic's coming.
[00:54:10.183 --> 00:54:12.144]  The flu makers were quietly gearing up.
[00:54:12.464 --> 00:54:13.424]  They knew this was coming.
[00:54:13.464 --> 00:54:16.366]  A lot of scientists say it's clearly been designed.
[00:54:16.826 --> 00:54:22.489]  Then we saw the hype in the aftermath, the attempt to make it mandatory in New York and in Massachusetts.
[00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:27.117]  I mean, I know you're a scientist, a doctor, a researcher, a journalist.
[00:54:27.137 --> 00:54:30.826]  You go off what you can prove, but in your gut, is this whole thing staged?
[00:54:32.273 --> 00:54:35.295]  I think that there is some staging to it.
[00:54:35.635 --> 00:54:38.877]  And what I'm really concerned about is the next wave that's going to come along.
[00:54:39.238 --> 00:54:45.502]  I think that these people, they pushed way too hard to get everybody vaccinated for what was known to be a mild virus.
[00:54:45.782 --> 00:54:48.664]  It wasn't any different than any other influenza virus that we've seen before.
[00:54:49.044 --> 00:54:50.405]  And they pushed way too hard.
[00:54:50.765 --> 00:54:52.707]  Now we're seeing some things sort of fall through the cracks.
[00:54:52.767 --> 00:54:55.248]  I'm real concerned about the stuff that's happening in the Ukraine.
[00:54:55.268 --> 00:54:58.070]  I mean, we don't know for sure what's happening over there.
[00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:00.752]  We really don't know what's going to happen come wintertime.
[00:55:01.292 --> 00:55:05.435]  When the Winter Olympics is in Vancouver and there's a whole group of people that are there from all over the world.
[00:55:05.455 --> 00:55:06.855]  I mean, what's going to happen then?
[00:55:07.976 --> 00:55:10.858]  I'm really concerned about the accidents that are happening in schools.
[00:55:11.038 --> 00:55:13.759]  These kids are getting two and three and four flu shots.
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:16.961]  You know, that they get the regular flu shot, the swine flu shot.
[00:55:17.261 --> 00:55:19.383]  I'm super concerned about the flu mist vaccine.
[00:55:19.423 --> 00:55:21.544]  Yeah, maybe it was an accident with Jeffrey Dahmer.
[00:55:21.564 --> 00:55:22.664]  Maybe that was all an accident.
[00:55:23.105 --> 00:55:24.626]  I mean, it's always an accident.
[00:55:25.006 --> 00:55:28.008]  If you or I injected a child whose parents were against it, we go to jail.
[00:55:28.048 --> 00:55:30.209]  But when they have accidents, oopsie, no big deal.
[00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:35.051]  Yeah, and they always say that, you know, these kids got multiple flu shots and they were safe.
[00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:36.172]  Nothing had happened.
[00:55:36.472 --> 00:55:41.274]  Well, you can't say that because you don't know what's going to happen two weeks, two months, two years from now.
[00:55:41.395 --> 00:55:46.777]  Well, we're also only finding out about mainly children that collapse and go to the hospital.
[00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:51.259]  That's what we found out in New York and other states that they had done a secret inoculation.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.081]  And notice the accidents are all with elementary students.
[00:55:54.301 --> 00:55:56.803]  Where they think the children won't be able to explain the story.
[00:55:57.023 --> 00:56:01.047]  And we caught schools denying they'd done it, and then later it would come out they had.
[00:56:01.087 --> 00:56:02.068]  So they're also lying.
[00:56:02.108 --> 00:56:04.310]  I mean, this is really creepy and criminal.
[00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:06.212]  It very is much creepy and criminal.
[00:56:06.572 --> 00:56:09.955]  And it's like, parents should have some recourse to that.
[00:56:10.355 --> 00:56:16.541]  Now, I don't think that the parents can actually sue the school system, because they have to prove that something had harmed them.
[00:56:16.961 --> 00:56:18.603]  But I think they can go after the school boards.
[00:56:18.763 --> 00:56:19.484]  They can vote them out.
[00:56:19.744 --> 00:56:24.208]  They can show up at the school boards every single session that they have and force them to give them an answer.
[00:56:24.468 --> 00:56:26.009]  They can say, where is our money going?
[00:56:26.229 --> 00:56:29.672]  How much money are you getting, school board, for doing these inoculations in these school systems?
[00:56:30.313 --> 00:56:34.256]  And I think that parents need to be really, really proactive because this is just the first step.
[00:56:34.617 --> 00:56:37.339]  If they're doing this with flu shots, what's going to be the next thing?
[00:56:37.359 --> 00:56:39.641]  Are you going to inoculate kids at school with Gardasil?
[00:56:39.901 --> 00:56:40.881]  Okay, stay there.
[00:56:41.061 --> 00:56:42.742]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is our guest.
[00:56:43.042 --> 00:56:44.483]  We're going to come back, long segment.
[00:56:44.503 --> 00:56:50.825]  We're going to go over the flu, Gardasil, the forced inoculations, what's happening in Ukraine, what she thinks is coming up next.
[00:56:51.125 --> 00:56:53.126]  But first, we'll talk about the debate last night.
[00:56:53.466 --> 00:56:54.747]  Get some details from her on that.
[00:56:55.717 --> 00:57:04.822]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[00:57:04.862 --> 00:57:07.984]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[00:57:08.224 --> 00:57:13.927]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad spectrum detoxification.
[00:57:14.107 --> 00:57:18.589]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:21.231]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[00:57:21.491 --> 00:57:30.576]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[00:57:30.696 --> 00:57:36.099]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.
[00:57:36.239 --> 00:57:38.060]  Help others and earn extra income!
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:38.480]  We're good.
[00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:58.982]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:57:59.383 --> 00:58:04.347]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:04.707 --> 00:58:06.449]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:58:06.769 --> 00:58:11.573]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:58:11.774 --> 00:58:12.734]  How much do you want?
[00:58:12.955 --> 00:58:13.695]  When do you want it?
[00:58:14.076 --> 00:58:15.677]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:58:15.957 --> 00:58:16.778]  When will you need it?
[00:58:17.038 --> 00:58:19.100]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.341]  Will there be any food?
[00:58:20.581 --> 00:58:21.923]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:58:22.103 --> 00:58:22.363]  If there's
[00:58:22.403 --> 00:58:24.466]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:58:24.626 --> 00:58:27.150]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:30.554]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:58:30.935 --> 00:58:34.440]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:35.762]  How much will you need?
[00:58:36.002 --> 00:58:36.603]  We don't know.
[00:58:36.903 --> 00:58:37.804]  How much do you want?
[00:58:38.005 --> 00:58:38.726]  All you can get.
[00:58:38.746 --> 00:58:39.627]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:40.007 --> 00:58:40.268]  I think.
[00:58:55.385 --> 00:59:02.230]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:59:02.370 --> 00:59:03.611]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:59:03.631 --> 00:59:04.311]  It's very real.
[00:59:04.451 --> 00:59:08.214]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[00:59:08.354 --> 00:59:12.677]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:59:12.817 --> 00:59:15.199]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:59:15.399 --> 00:59:21.203]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[00:59:21.403 --> 00:59:26.129]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:28.933]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:59:29.033 --> 00:59:31.657]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:59:31.737 --> 00:59:38.907]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[00:59:47.993 --> 00:59:54.617]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:59:57.599 --> 01:00:03.622]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:04.223 --> 01:00:07.205]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:08.683 --> 01:00:22.915]  Well, the leading fighter against the military-industrial complex, Big Pharma, pushed to force Gardasil, hepatitis shots, flu shots filled with mercury on our children is here.
[01:00:22.955 --> 01:00:27.039]  She's been debating the health department at the University of Texas at Austin.
[01:00:27.099 --> 01:00:28.640]  She is here in studio with us.
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:31.142]  Your calls are coming up at the bottom of the hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:31.162 --> 01:00:31.342]  Okay, Doc,
[01:00:34.745 --> 01:00:39.306]  Addressing folks out there in TV land and in radio land, you've got the floor.
[01:00:39.727 --> 01:00:57.592]  Whatever you think is most important to talk about, I'd like to first hear about the debate last night, what you did today, and then your concerns about this being a preparatory phase for something bigger this year or next year, what's happening in Ukraine, the good news that people are resisting, the bad news that the government is still trying to push it.
[01:00:58.172 --> 01:00:59.853]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, give us a report.
[01:01:00.728 --> 01:01:05.389]  Well, last night was a really interesting evening with the officials from the Health Department.
[01:01:05.749 --> 01:01:09.130]  We had the person that was on stage with us, which was great, Dr. Betz.
[01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:10.991]  He really was a trooper.
[01:01:11.571 --> 01:01:18.813]  He actually had said to us before we started the talk, we went up and introduced ourselves and said, thank you for coming and we really like to have you.
[01:01:18.833 --> 01:01:20.854]  We're really glad that you're willing to do this.
[01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:23.577]  And he said, well, nobody else really wanted to do it.
[01:01:23.798 --> 01:01:25.320]  And I said, well, why is that?
[01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:26.361]  He says, here's your opportunity.
[01:01:26.401 --> 01:01:31.529]  Here's your floor in terms of your opportunity to tell your whole side of the story.
[01:01:31.869 --> 01:01:34.493]  And he said, well, we've done things like this before and they haven't gone well.
[01:01:35.054 --> 01:01:36.316]  And I think it really did go well.
[01:01:36.496 --> 01:01:38.638]  I think that we had a very respectful audience.
[01:01:38.718 --> 01:01:43.302]  I think that we had an opportunity to have questions ahead of time that we had answered.
[01:01:44.964 --> 01:01:51.489]  Some of the questions were things like, do we really think that the H1N1 vaccine was really going to be the cause of the pandemic?
[01:01:52.190 --> 01:02:02.723]  And one of the things that I said was, well, I think that the flu mist has a risk because that's a live virus vaccine that's going up everybody's nose and that you can shed that virus for up to 21 days.
[01:02:03.083 --> 01:02:06.647]  But that I have personally a bigger concern about Tamiflu.
[01:02:07.188 --> 01:02:16.051]  And that I think that Tamiflu and even the scientific literature talks about 16% of the viruses each year become resistant to Tamiflu.
[01:02:16.451 --> 01:02:30.055]  So if we start creating very resistant mutant viruses and those mutant viruses get out into the environment and they're resistant and they start to do this thing called reassortment and come together and create an even bigger virus that is going to be even more of a problem.
[01:02:30.995 --> 01:02:32.255]  And they sort of agreed with that.
[01:02:32.756 --> 01:02:40.478]  One of the questions that got asked to me was, is there any evidence in the medical literature that vaccines have caused harm and problems?
[01:02:41.058 --> 01:02:57.422]  And I was really glad that that came to me because, you know, I spend most of my life researching the problems with vaccines, and I know that I've personally done more than 350 articles that have pulled looking at all the different problems with all of the different vaccines, particularly hepatitis B, the things with the flu shot,
[01:02:57.822 --> 01:02:58.202]  Thank you!
[01:03:16.221 --> 01:03:21.066]  They weren't in much agreement when Don Richardson from Prove and I were doing sort of a back and forth.
[01:03:21.607 --> 01:03:26.832]  But they couldn't deny the fact that there was another whole side of this story.
[01:03:27.152 --> 01:03:30.836]  They couldn't deny the fact that we were telling them what the science and the research was.
[01:03:31.236 --> 01:03:35.681]  They darted and danced around a lot of the issues sometimes when people were asking them about mandates.
[01:03:36.341 --> 01:03:38.023]  They never did give really straight answers.
[01:03:38.584 --> 01:03:50.958]  And I think that Texas, at least from what they said last night, and I'm really glad that Alex, that people were there filming this, because they were saying in quite strong language that we're not going to see mandates in Texas.
[01:03:51.098 --> 01:03:52.960]  Flu shots will not be mandated in Texas.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:04:08.046]  And I think that if there becomes a problem down the road with this flu shot shortage and if they think it gets worse over the winter and they start pulling this stuff about mandates, I hope that now you've got recording on footage that you can go back and challenge them on that to saying that you are backing out on your word.
[01:04:08.286 --> 01:04:13.228]  Just to jump in briefly, the problem is, as you know, they do this color of law.
[01:04:13.448 --> 01:04:16.970]  They tell parents it's mandatory your children take the flu shot.
[01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:19.351]  They've been announcing all children must take it all over the country.
[01:04:20.151 --> 01:04:26.315]  And then they kick your child out saying they violated policy and then trigger truancy laws.
[01:04:26.695 --> 01:04:36.802]  So they kick you out themselves, then they trigger the truancy provision, and then have a few examples of a couple parents they haul into court.
[01:04:37.242 --> 01:04:43.286]  And then the news announced parents have been arrested or parents have been charged for not vaccinating when really
[01:04:44.286 --> 01:04:47.488]  The school knows they have that vaccine waiver exemption form.
[01:04:47.828 --> 01:04:51.250]  They never tell you and engage in the crime of kicking your child out.
[01:04:51.290 --> 01:04:54.292]  It's like Governor Rick Perry two years ago says, it's mandatory.
[01:04:54.412 --> 01:04:56.333]  All girls in Texas must take Gardasil.
[01:04:56.774 --> 01:04:59.895]  Then federal vaccine liability protection kicks in.
[01:04:59.975 --> 01:05:02.557]  Merck knows in their own trials it killed and maimed people.
[01:05:03.097 --> 01:05:05.479]  Now nationwide they announce all girls must take it.
[01:05:05.959 --> 01:05:14.026]  But really he just said it's a recommended through the health department that it be listed on the group that they say it's school policy you take.
[01:05:14.346 --> 01:05:20.391]  So they dance around this because with people that are ignorant they come in and lie and say you must take these shots.
[01:05:20.811 --> 01:05:29.478]  I mean I've read reports in mainstream news about parents having their children CPS taken or trying to take them for not taking hepatitis shots with a newborn baby.
[01:05:29.678 --> 01:05:30.579]  There's no law
[01:05:30.919 --> 01:05:33.061]  How are they taking your children saying it's neglect?
[01:05:33.341 --> 01:05:36.183]  Can you speak to that, how deceptive these people are?
[01:05:36.703 --> 01:05:39.426]  Yeah, I think it's really important for people to think about that.
[01:05:39.706 --> 01:05:53.737]  When parents go to the hospitals and they're going to have their baby, I mean, I always say the place where you need to intercede, actually at the very beginning place where I think people need to intercede and investigate the vaccine issue, is when they're dating somebody.
[01:05:54.477 --> 01:06:02.962]  Because at that point in time, you're probably talking about how your families get along, you're talking about religion and politics and money and living and jobs and careers.
[01:06:03.263 --> 01:06:05.684]  You really need to discuss the vaccination issue.
[01:06:05.704 --> 01:06:12.929]  Because it may turn out that one person in the party is totally against vaccines and the other person is totally for vaccines.
[01:06:12.949 --> 01:06:16.051]  Now can you imagine getting married and bringing a child into that?
[01:06:16.351 --> 01:06:18.493]  And at that point in time, having this huge contention.
[01:06:18.853 --> 01:06:29.283]  And I have testified in far too many court cases where one parent has tried to use vaccination as a child abuse issue against the other parent so that they don't have to pay child support.
[01:06:29.303 --> 01:06:30.604]  That happened with Charlie Sheen!
[01:06:31.425 --> 01:06:48.339]  Denise, and I know you know Charlie, you've talked to him, Denise Richards in the divorce and then in trying to take him away so he couldn't see him said he believes 9-11 was an inside job and he believes vaccines might hurt his girls when it's on record that vaccines have damaged incredible amounts of people.
[01:06:48.599 --> 01:06:49.180]  Absolutely.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:59.109]  So I sort of tell people that before you go to the hospital to have a baby, you know, you need to know what you want to do about the hepatitis B vaccine, the vitamin K shot, you know, all of those things.
[01:06:59.429 --> 01:07:01.011]  But I think it really should start before that.
[01:07:01.371 --> 01:07:12.602]  And I actually have a friend in Cleveland who's a nurse midwife that she will not accept a client as a client unless both the mother and the father are in agreement about vaccination.
[01:07:12.682 --> 01:07:14.204]  What's your view on the vitamin K?
[01:07:15.307 --> 01:07:19.010]  I think that there are a lot of reasons to put that off.
[01:07:19.170 --> 01:07:30.658]  The vitamin K shot was actually put into play in the hospital ostensibly because of blood disorders and because of the very, very remote risk of bleeding that can happen in the brain if you don't have vitamin K on board.
[01:07:31.138 --> 01:07:35.200]  But vitamin K starts to be developed in the neonatal liver at about 7 days.
[01:07:35.741 --> 01:07:39.162]  And the vitamin K shot was also instituted because of circumcision.
[01:07:39.603 --> 01:07:42.324]  The circumcision was always done at 7 to 8 days.
[01:07:42.404 --> 01:07:46.046]  It was a Jewish tradition in that they did it at 7 days.
[01:07:46.406 --> 01:07:54.911]  When they started doing the circumcision in the hospital on day 2 and 3, the baby hadn't already been producing enough vitamin K in their liver so that they would be bleeding.
[01:07:55.131 --> 01:08:00.114]  Isn't it amazing that the rabbis knew thousands of years ago to do it on seven days when they had blood clotting?
[01:08:00.274 --> 01:08:00.774]  Exactly.
[01:08:01.194 --> 01:08:01.934]  How did they know that?
[01:08:02.835 --> 01:08:04.416]  I don't know how they knew that, but they did.
[01:08:05.176 --> 01:08:05.616]  I don't know.
[01:08:05.816 --> 01:08:07.617]  It was just a tradition.
[01:08:07.657 --> 01:08:08.998]  I mean, there's a lot of things.
[01:08:09.038 --> 01:08:10.839]  I mean, how do we know from years ago?
[01:08:10.859 --> 01:08:12.000]  I don't know how to answer that.
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:13.120]  That's amazing.
[01:08:15.181 --> 01:08:18.863]  Let's get into Ukraine and also the adverse reaction reports.
[01:08:19.543 --> 01:08:21.424]  This Washington Redskins cheerleader
[01:08:25.276 --> 01:08:29.381]  She went to Johns Hopkins, other facilities, they said, yes, you've got this neurological disorder.
[01:08:29.441 --> 01:08:30.943]  The FDA said, yes, this can happen.
[01:08:31.744 --> 01:08:34.086]  And then she went and got some treatments and is getting better.
[01:08:34.106 --> 01:08:40.093]  I know Dale Dudley, 93.7 talk show host, he took a flu shot and months later got...
[01:08:41.014 --> 01:08:44.756]  Numb in his hands and feet, started getting paralyzed, started having trouble walking.
[01:08:45.196 --> 01:08:49.037]  He went to a bunch of specialists and medical doctors said, you had a bad vaccine reaction.
[01:08:49.338 --> 01:08:50.078]  He got better.
[01:08:50.518 --> 01:08:52.879]  Now they're trying to say it's a hoax because she got better.
[01:08:53.159 --> 01:08:58.001]  But the FDA itself says, don't worry, if you do have a neurological problem, most of the time it gets better.
[01:08:58.201 --> 01:09:04.944]  But they're trying to have it both ways, saying, well, because Desiree is getting better, it must be fake.
[01:09:04.964 --> 01:09:08.906]  But then there's all these other reports where they're admitting it's causing neurological problems.
[01:09:09.676 --> 01:09:11.357]  Yeah, it's always amazing, isn't it?
[01:09:11.437 --> 01:09:18.301]  That if you get sick and you haven't been vaccinated, it's because you weren't vaccinated.
[01:09:18.722 --> 01:09:22.784]  But if you had a vaccine and you have a bad reaction, it's never the vaccine.
[01:09:22.804 --> 01:09:25.146]  I mean, talk about having it both ways.
[01:09:25.666 --> 01:09:43.998]  And so, and it's amazing that even though conventional medicine completely failed this woman and had nothing to offer her, and then she goes and finds a physician, you know, who is actually Dr. Buttar's a friend of mine, and they went to his clinic and they find out that there's some things in an alternative medicine arena that can be done, and she starts to get better.
[01:09:44.198 --> 01:09:44.939]  Now it was a hoax.
[01:09:44.979 --> 01:09:45.979]  She was misdiagnosed.
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:50.823]  It couldn't possibly work because their particular tools didn't work, means that there aren't any tools that work.
[01:09:51.143 --> 01:09:52.684]  That is very, very bad.
[01:09:52.844 --> 01:10:03.370]  What is Dr. Buttar and others, because he helped Jenny McCarthy and many others, you know, they're trying to, as Dr. Blalock says, reduce the autoimmune inflammation.
[01:10:03.671 --> 01:10:05.732]  They're trying to chelate and remove the metals.
[01:10:05.752 --> 01:10:07.533]  I mean, what are these treatments?
[01:10:07.981 --> 01:10:09.241]  You know, I'm not exactly sure.
[01:10:09.261 --> 01:10:13.623]  I know that there's a lot of IV treatments that are involved, and I know it's all out of what you said.
[01:10:14.063 --> 01:10:19.645]  I think there's a lot of IV vitamin C, probably glutathione, probably different types of things that pull the metals out of the body.
[01:10:20.125 --> 01:10:29.949]  But it's all about rebalancing the physiology and putting the right biochemistry in, and interceding quickly so that you can stop those inflammatory molecules from causing damage.
[01:10:30.109 --> 01:10:45.119]  And instead of them admitting vaccines are causing a lot of this, and giving people treatments when they give their 18-month-old the third round of shots, they have a convulsion, never talk again, instead of rushing them in and saying, detox, detox, oh no, it wasn't a shot, there's no treatment, you must have shaken your baby.
[01:10:45.925 --> 01:10:50.090]  Yeah, and the other piece of that, you know, they're always talking about how much the vaccine programs cost.
[01:10:50.391 --> 01:10:59.982]  There's a cost that has never really been analyzed, Alex, that I think is really important, and you've addressed it, is the fact that if you have a bad reaction and you go to the doctor's office, now what do they do?
[01:11:00.022 --> 01:11:02.485]  They put you through all of these tests, and I'll give you one quick example.
[01:11:03.166 --> 01:11:07.168]  For example, the hepatitis B vaccine that they give babies in the hospital.
[01:11:07.629 --> 01:11:11.271]  One of the side effects, right on the package insert, is that babies can get reflux.
[01:11:11.311 --> 01:11:12.111]  They can get GERD.
[01:11:12.532 --> 01:11:14.813]  So now they start having GERD and maybe bad diarrhea.
[01:11:14.873 --> 01:11:16.094]  They take them to the pediatrician.
[01:11:16.134 --> 01:11:16.674]  What do they do?
[01:11:17.154 --> 01:11:21.397]  Upper GI's, lower GI's, endoscopy, they do CAT scans, they do all these different things.
[01:11:21.557 --> 01:11:21.797]  Antibiotics!
[01:11:22.057 --> 01:11:30.520]  Antibiotics, all these different things to this baby, rather than going, oh, here it says right here on the package insert, this is a side effect, probably just a side effect of the vaccine.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:44.104]  All of those costs, thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars of inconclusive tests, multiply that times thousands and thousands of patients, that is also a cost to the vaccine system, about vaccines.
[01:11:44.224 --> 01:11:49.606]  Well, I've talked to old pediatricians that saw kids 50 years ago, they say babies are different today.
[01:11:50.166 --> 01:11:51.087]  Something's wrong with them.
[01:11:51.107 --> 01:11:52.448]  I mean, they got dull eyes.
[01:11:52.488 --> 01:11:53.509]  They're getting brain damage.
[01:11:53.529 --> 01:11:54.991]  But it starts before babies.
[01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:55.551]  Stay right there.
[01:11:55.571 --> 01:11:56.132]  We're coming back.
[01:11:56.572 --> 01:11:58.014]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:11:58.674 --> 01:12:03.519]  More than half the world's doctors and nurses are refusing risky vaccinations this fall.
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:12.627]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations, especially this flu season.
[01:12:13.536 --> 01:12:15.457]  Rely on OxySilver instead.
[01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:21.760]  OxySilver's broad spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[01:12:22.241 --> 01:12:24.982]  OxySilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol.
[01:12:25.522 --> 01:12:27.243]  Far safer than colloidal silvers.

[01:12:32.786 --> 01:12:36.048]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[01:12:36.528 --> 01:12:38.149]  So get it while you still can.

[01:12:57.362 --> 01:13:01.024]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:13:01.364 --> 01:13:04.407]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:13:04.627 --> 01:13:06.048]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:13:06.747 --> 01:13:09.408]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:13:09.428 --> 01:13:15.629]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:13:15.789 --> 01:13:20.810]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:30.972]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:13:31.092 --> 01:13:33.194]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:13:33.434 --> 01:13:34.775]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:13:35.035 --> 01:13:37.296]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:39.338]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:13:39.618 --> 01:13:44.441]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:13:44.762 --> 01:13:49.545]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:13:55.936 --> 01:14:01.819]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[01:14:02.259 --> 01:14:06.922]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[01:14:07.202 --> 01:14:11.024]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[01:14:11.284 --> 01:14:12.464]  Let's put this another way.
[01:14:12.624 --> 01:14:16.866]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[01:14:17.987 --> 01:14:20.608]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[01:14:20.888 --> 01:14:23.229]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[01:14:23.529 --> 01:14:24.970]  You can possess it in your hand.
[01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:26.211]  You can take it with you.
[01:14:26.511 --> 01:14:27.591]  Gold is real money.
[01:14:27.991 --> 01:14:29.092]  Gold is honest money.
[01:14:29.352 --> 01:14:31.593]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.
[01:14:32.073 --> 01:14:39.116]  To find out how you can protect your savings and roll over your IRA funds into precious metal accounts, call me at 800-686-2237 extension 134.
[01:14:39.176 --> 01:14:39.396]  That's 800-686-2237
[01:14:56.484 --> 01:15:12.230]  Attention, an important product from hempusa.org, micro plant powder will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[01:15:12.530 --> 01:15:13.710]  Micro plant powder is 89%
[01:15:14.991 --> 01:15:15.331]  We're good to go.
[01:15:15.491 --> 01:15:16.011]  We're good to go.
[01:15:16.031 --> 01:15:16.492]  We're good to go.
[01:15:40.822 --> 01:15:41.022]  I think so.
[01:16:01.625 --> 01:16:03.566]  Dr. Sherry Tinpenny is our guest in studio.
[01:16:03.666 --> 01:16:05.888]  A lot of ground to cover in a short time.
[01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:25.521]  Ukraine, you said at the start of the interview, and then we got cut off by the break, that you're really concerned about what's happening over there, that they may be getting ready to release something else, they may have released something, that this huge build-up in and around a medical emergency is really perfect for the establishment, especially with the economic collapse, this global realignment, what's happening with the dollar.
[01:16:26.021 --> 01:16:26.642]  Please continue.
[01:16:27.202 --> 01:16:29.944]  I'm just concerned that there's another virus that's come into play.
[01:16:30.384 --> 01:16:40.732]  Because when you look at those numbers, if you can believe them at all, and there was a couple of really good sites that I looked at that looked at the numbers and how exponentially that there was more and more people getting sick in a very short period of time.
[01:16:40.752 --> 01:16:42.593]  I mean, was it something in the air?
[01:16:42.813 --> 01:16:44.054]  Was it something that was released?
[01:16:44.114 --> 01:16:48.817]  Was it one of these mutant viruses that we talked about in terms of Tamiflu, that now maybe the H1N1 and the
[01:16:49.858 --> 01:16:58.884]  And the H5N1 and maybe one of these mutant viruses that started to reassort and that there is really something a lot more virulent that's going on.
[01:16:59.064 --> 01:17:03.847]  Because with their supercomputers, they know how it's going to mutate in enough of a population.
[01:17:04.087 --> 01:17:08.190]  They admit that the nasal was live and could mutate and be spread.
[01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:10.531]  Why did they put out the first H1N1 vaccine nasal?
[01:17:12.699 --> 01:17:14.460]  Well, I think that was more for convenience.
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:19.582]  I think that that was kind of an easy thing to do, but it really does spread around in the population.
[01:17:19.742 --> 01:17:21.623]  What do we know about this virus in Ukraine?
[01:17:21.643 --> 01:17:22.604]  I mean, is it a flu virus?
[01:17:22.644 --> 01:17:22.984]  What is it?
[01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:24.125]  Nobody seems to know.
[01:17:24.145 --> 01:17:25.565]  They just say, oh, it's killing people.
[01:17:25.805 --> 01:17:26.286]  Exactly.
[01:17:26.386 --> 01:17:31.428]  And the World Health Organization sent a bunch of people down there that they ostensibly said, oh, it's just the H1N1 virus.
[01:17:31.468 --> 01:17:34.350]  It's just the novel one we've been talking about, nothing to be concerned about.
[01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:38.892]  But that is not the way that that virus has behaved over the course of the last eight months.
[01:17:39.332 --> 01:17:46.637]  You know, when we see the reports coming out of the Southern Hemisphere, we didn't have people that exponentially number of people getting sick in a very short period of time.
[01:17:47.198 --> 01:17:53.102]  So I think that there's something else that's happening there that I think there's still some missing pieces, but I'm sure it's a story that will evolve.
[01:17:53.482 --> 01:17:57.865]  Well, that's what happened in January as we had emergency managers in Indiana, New York.
[01:17:57.945 --> 01:18:04.370]  I got internal secret documents that were later confirmed in New York where they were telling cemeteries get ready for millions dead.
[01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:06.151]  That was in January, March.
[01:18:06.751 --> 01:18:07.852]  January, February, March.
[01:18:08.372 --> 01:18:11.534]  And I went on air and I said, they're coming with some type of big flu hype.
[01:18:11.594 --> 01:18:12.695]  I don't know if it's going to be real.
[01:18:13.235 --> 01:18:14.116]  It may just be hype.
[01:18:14.216 --> 01:18:16.897]  But they're really building up like we've never seen.
[01:18:17.237 --> 01:18:19.919]  And we never saw flu pandemics coming this quickly.
[01:18:20.499 --> 01:18:23.181]  Now they're coming in shorter and shorter increments, aren't they?
[01:18:23.601 --> 01:18:27.943]  You know, Alex, I have a document on my computer that was from 2003 that was released.
[01:18:27.983 --> 01:18:41.410]  It was a small little report that came out from the CIA that actually said that they were very concerned that there was going to be the development of a virus down the road that could be activated by a second virus and that there would be no way.
[01:18:41.490 --> 01:18:43.551]  It was in a bioterrorism website.
[01:18:43.991 --> 01:18:53.764]  And they had no way of knowing and there would be no way to be able to control that if there was a virus that had been released and then a second virus would activate it and it may be even activated by taking aspirin.
[01:18:54.304 --> 01:18:57.188]  I'll get you that report because it was just a small little report.
[01:18:57.228 --> 01:18:59.190]  I stumbled across it on my computer the other day.
[01:18:59.271 --> 01:19:01.674]  Why does aspirin activate so many things?
[01:19:02.114 --> 01:19:02.975]  I don't really know.
[01:19:03.075 --> 01:19:06.778]  I think it really has to do with the way that it interferes with the cytokine reactions.
[01:19:07.219 --> 01:19:11.923]  But it really has, it causes all sorts of reactions into the bloodstream.
[01:19:12.424 --> 01:19:17.528]  But you know this, that if aspirin was developed today, it would not be an over-the-counter drug.
[01:19:17.548 --> 01:19:20.671]  I mean, it would be a prescription because of how many different effects it has on the body.
[01:19:21.392 --> 01:19:22.473]  Some good, some bad.
[01:19:22.633 --> 01:19:23.474]  Some good, some bad.
[01:19:23.994 --> 01:19:24.515]  Mostly bad.
[01:19:26.067 --> 01:19:33.373]  Well, that's incredible because they admit Tamiflu has all these bad reactions and is highly restricted in Japan.
[01:19:33.833 --> 01:19:35.835]  They're just giving it to everybody like it's candy.
[01:19:36.055 --> 01:19:44.282]  And just like antibiotics make bacteria mutate quicker, I guess in a layman's terms, that's what these antivirals do.
[01:19:44.602 --> 01:19:45.202]  Absolutely.
[01:19:45.582 --> 01:19:47.863]  And the World Health Organization talks about this.
[01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:59.647]  I mean, every month they come out with reports that there is now an H1N1 virus that has been identified in a particular country like South Vietnam or Thailand or China or places that it's resistant.
[01:19:59.907 --> 01:20:06.309]  They know that last year the H1N1 strain in the seasonal flu virus was 100% resistant to Tamiflu.
[01:20:06.749 --> 01:20:11.671]  Well, that had to have happened because we used a lot of Tamiflu previous to that.
[01:20:12.191 --> 01:20:13.411]  So it's going to happen.
[01:20:13.471 --> 01:20:17.453]  I mean, it has to happen that these viruses are going to mutate and morph around.
[01:20:17.693 --> 01:20:21.574]  You can't be fooling with Mother Nature like we do and not expect to have a bad outcome.
[01:20:21.994 --> 01:20:23.715]  Okay, I've been asking a lot of the questions.
[01:20:23.735 --> 01:20:28.379]  When we come back before we take calls, whatever you think is most important, I'd like you to speak about it.
[01:20:28.399 --> 01:20:37.585]  And then also, again, the victory of the fact that people are waking up to this push for forced inoculation, you know, this huge brainwashing campaign.
[01:20:37.605 --> 01:20:38.606]  So that's positive.
[01:20:39.106 --> 01:20:46.151]  But also on the negative side, the fact that the government would try to push this globally and the UN is in control of the situation, that's scary.
[01:20:46.371 --> 01:20:47.212]  It's very scary.
[01:20:47.552 --> 01:20:48.312]  It's very frightening.
[01:20:48.372 --> 01:20:52.775]  And people really, you know, it's so good, Alex, that we're able to talk about things like this.
[01:20:52.835 --> 01:20:57.778]  It's so good that people are taking an active role in investigating for themselves and just saying no.
[01:20:58.479 --> 01:21:01.941]  I think all the people now that are willing to take flu shots, I mean, they're in the minority.
[01:21:02.321 --> 01:21:04.502]  We've got more people saying, no, I don't want this.
[01:21:04.982 --> 01:21:07.384]  There are other things I can do to keep myself healthy.
[01:21:07.784 --> 01:21:12.686]  I can do vitamin D, vitamin C, there's herbals, there's oregano oil, there's all sorts of things that are out there.
[01:21:13.807 --> 01:21:19.910]  Even simple things, getting plenty of sleep, you know, drinking good water, getting plenty of organic food as much as you can.
[01:21:20.170 --> 01:21:21.591]  There's all sorts of things you can do.
[01:21:21.671 --> 01:21:21.831]  Sunshine.
[01:21:21.971 --> 01:21:23.352]  Sunshine, absolutely.
[01:21:23.952 --> 01:21:44.004]  If you are north of the 37th parallel in the wintertime, they've actually shown that even if you are outside in the sunshine in the wintertime, north of the 37th parallel, which is like if you take a line from San Francisco and sort of draw it straight across the country, the sun isn't strong enough to give you enough vitamin D that you need to keep yourself warm in the winter.
[01:21:44.024 --> 01:21:44.605]  Okay, we got a break.
[01:21:44.645 --> 01:21:45.385]  We'll come right back.
[01:21:46.446 --> 01:21:47.546]  We're on the march.
[01:21:47.566 --> 01:21:49.448]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:49.468 --> 01:21:53.050]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:55.669 --> 01:22:00.836]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:22:00.976 --> 01:22:05.342]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:22:05.502 --> 01:22:07.365]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:22:07.785 --> 01:22:09.127]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:22:09.407 --> 01:22:10.449]  There is a solution.
[01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:18.692]  InterHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:22:19.092 --> 01:22:26.155]  Try their InterFood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:22:26.555 --> 01:22:32.237]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:22:32.597 --> 01:22:38.159]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[01:22:55.523 --> 01:23:04.649]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:23:04.689 --> 01:23:07.811]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:23:08.051 --> 01:23:13.755]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:23:13.915 --> 01:23:18.418]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:23:18.698 --> 01:23:21.040]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:30.405]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[01:23:30.505 --> 01:23:35.929]  He also recommends ZeoLife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.
[01:23:36.069 --> 01:23:37.930]  Help others and earn extra income.

[01:23:56.237 --> 01:24:00.463]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:24:00.803 --> 01:24:04.889]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:10.556]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:24:10.897 --> 01:24:11.237]  It's true.
[01:24:11.237 --> 01:24:11.317]  True.
[01:24:11.617 --> 01:24:17.041]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:24:17.322 --> 01:24:20.604]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:24:20.904 --> 01:24:25.388]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:24:25.628 --> 01:24:27.990]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:31.733]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:24:32.073 --> 01:24:33.214]  Come, you masters of war.
[01:25:05.357 --> 01:25:06.898]  We're launching something new.
[01:25:07.679 --> 01:25:13.845]  Several times during the radio show every day, we're going to come back into segments playing one-minute comments from listeners.
[01:25:14.485 --> 01:25:16.467]  Questions, comments, you agree, you disagree.
[01:25:17.594 --> 01:25:17.794]  I think?
[01:25:47.577 --> 01:25:49.798]  Tell you about some of the books and materials she has available.
[01:25:49.858 --> 01:25:54.059]  Rob Dew's idea for her to put out a line of t-shirts to educate folks.
[01:25:54.079 --> 01:25:54.499]  They've done it.
[01:25:54.519 --> 01:25:55.259]  They're very handsome.
[01:25:55.279 --> 01:25:55.939]  She brought me some.
[01:25:55.959 --> 01:25:56.639]  We'll show you those.
[01:25:56.659 --> 01:25:59.620]  I want to support the work she's doing so she can do this full-time.
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:05.622]  As she says, there's money-making work, being a doctor, and then her own money flying all over the country trying to educate people.
[01:26:05.642 --> 01:26:10.843]  She's a wonderful lady, so we want to financially support her and our sponsors that financially support us.
[01:26:11.443 --> 01:26:13.024]  One of them is Diginet.net.
[01:26:13.304 --> 01:26:15.425]  You get 10% off the Diginet pins.
[01:26:15.505 --> 01:26:16.025]  It's a little pin.
[01:26:16.065 --> 01:26:18.286]  You press one button, it shoots audio and video.
[01:26:18.306 --> 01:26:22.828]  10% off right now when you go to the Diginet.net website.
[01:26:22.849 --> 01:26:25.130]  That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[01:26:25.150 --> 01:26:28.191]  They have sunglasses that have hidden cameras in them and so much more.
[01:26:28.591 --> 01:26:29.812]  That's Diginet.net.
[01:26:30.152 --> 01:26:33.394]  E-T-F-O-9 is the product code to get 10% off.
[01:26:33.754 --> 01:26:34.814]  E-T-F-O-9.
[01:26:34.854 --> 01:26:35.755]  Diginet.net.
[01:26:36.035 --> 01:26:37.916]  Or give them a call and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:26:37.936 --> 01:26:37.976]  888-344-6681.
[01:26:40.737 --> 01:26:43.981]  That's 888-344-6681.
[01:26:44.602 --> 01:26:50.429]  And I also want to tell the listeners out there about FrontSight.
[01:26:50.769 --> 01:26:53.192]  FrontSight.com, like the front of your rifle site.
[01:26:53.532 --> 01:26:57.297]  Premier firearms, handgun, rifle, shotgun training for the whole family.
[01:26:57.737 --> 01:27:01.558]  No drill instructor attitude above law enforcement and military training.
[01:27:01.578 --> 01:27:03.539]  A lot of law enforcement and military train there.
[01:27:03.559 --> 01:27:06.440]  They have a lot of free info on their site as well, FrontSite.com.
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:12.402]  You can get a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice by going to FrontSite.com.
[01:27:12.463 --> 01:27:14.263]  Again, that's FrontSite.com.
[01:27:14.303 --> 01:27:17.865]  Find out about their free offers there at FrontSite.com.
[01:27:18.345 --> 01:27:21.606]  And lastly today, with our sponsors,
[01:27:25.404 --> 01:27:27.925]  We want to tell you about Ecolablue.com.
[01:27:28.145 --> 01:27:28.846]  Ecolablue.
[01:27:29.586 --> 01:27:30.186]  Ecolablue.
[01:27:30.226 --> 01:27:33.708]  Did you know you could be drinking fresh, clean water made right from the air you breathe?
[01:27:33.768 --> 01:27:35.529]  No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[01:27:35.869 --> 01:27:39.571]  Our sponsor, Ecolablue, with the Ecolablue 28 machine, will allow you to do just that.
[01:27:39.611 --> 01:27:43.053]  It's easy to use, and it will make up 7.5 gallons of water per day.
[01:27:43.393 --> 01:27:51.877]  The water, once generated, passes through a seven-stage filtering process, including reverse osmosis and carbon filtration techniques, ensuring that you know exactly what you are drinking.
[01:27:51.917 --> 01:27:53.818]  No chemicals, pollutants, or fluoride.
[01:27:54.238 --> 01:27:56.419]  We spent so much time talking about on this show.
[01:27:56.439 --> 01:28:10.145]  Get your own source of unlimited renewable drinking water that's absolutely clean for you and your family today by visiting them online at AkolaBlue.com or by clicking on the banners at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com or give AkolaBlue.com a call at 800-691-6043.
[01:28:10.205 --> 01:28:16.288]  And again, I want to thank all those great sponsors for making today's show possible.
[01:28:16.348 --> 01:28:16.768]  Possible.
[01:28:17.009 --> 01:28:24.975]  Before we go any further, Sherry, with my last few questions before we take some calls, tell folks again about your multiple websites that have all this great information on them.
[01:28:25.535 --> 01:28:42.389]  And the book that we carry, incidentally, you can also get it at her sites, Fowl, revised and updated, dealing with what's happening now, breaking down, exposing the hidden agenda, the agribusiness, drug company connection, the role of the environment in making the birds sick, and what was really behind the 1918 pandemic.
[01:28:42.669 --> 01:28:45.511]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, Fowl, a bestseller.
[01:28:46.448 --> 01:28:58.092]  Well, thank you Alex for talking about that because that book was written in 2006 and one of the main things, even though the title of the book talks about bird flu, it really is a playbook of exactly what's going on now.
[01:28:58.172 --> 01:29:08.675]  So if you want to know about the specifics about Tamiflu, how the vaccines are made, the cell line technologies, the eggs, all of those different things, it's all in that book and all of the backdrop in terms of the politics.
[01:29:08.875 --> 01:29:11.296]  There's a whole chapter on mandatory vaccination and so
[01:29:11.816 --> 01:29:16.777]  It's very timely information, even though it was published at the time that the bird flu was coming out.
[01:29:16.817 --> 01:29:17.717]  It's really, really timely.
[01:29:18.117 --> 01:29:23.259]  Then the other book is Saying No to Vaccines, and it's a resource guide for all ages.
[01:29:23.699 --> 01:29:27.859]  It's refuting the 25 most common reasons people think you should vaccinate.
[01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:30.920]  So you can just scan down the table of contents.
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:34.921]  You can look at a particular question, and you can go to that page and just read it.
[01:29:35.241 --> 01:29:39.302]  And then there's a footnoted reference right there that you can print out and hand to anybody that you want.
[01:29:39.727 --> 01:29:48.635]  And there's nobody out there as focused and professional as Dr. Sherry Jen Penny when it comes to exposing these frauds, these scams, these new rule of order operations.
[01:29:48.675 --> 01:29:49.816]  It's just wonderful.
[01:29:50.396 --> 01:29:56.782]  We were talking during the break with emails pouring in about people's husbands, their wives, dying, having heart attacks right after the shot.
[01:29:58.063 --> 01:29:58.884]  We're good to go.
[01:30:13.513 --> 01:30:17.255]  We are mass diagnosing all of you.
[01:30:17.755 --> 01:30:21.056]  None of this happened from the vaccines, even though their own inserts admit it.
[01:30:21.597 --> 01:30:30.900]  I remember, and he wrote about this, but the mainstream media had to later admit it when Tommy Thompson, head of Health and Human Services, he wouldn't even take it when all these people taking it were having heart attacks.
[01:30:31.481 --> 01:30:35.042]  And now we're seeing similar reports with this happening with the flu shot.
[01:30:35.482 --> 01:30:36.583]  Why is this happening?
[01:30:37.179 --> 01:30:46.989]  Well, the live flu vaccines, particularly the swine flu vaccine, when we talked about doing that after 9-11 and they've done it to the military, they were going to do it to first responders, all the health care workers.
[01:30:47.370 --> 01:30:51.694]  Well, the smallpox vaccine was injecting a live virus.
[01:30:52.195 --> 01:30:57.561]  That live virus was actually shown to cause hypercoagulability, which means it makes your blood clot.
[01:30:58.181 --> 01:31:02.424]  And people were dying from blood clots to the lungs, blood clots to the heart, and heart attacks.
[01:31:02.844 --> 01:31:09.948]  Well, this FluMist vaccine, the one that goes up the nose, it's a live virus.
[01:31:09.988 --> 01:31:11.789]  It's a weakened virus, but it's a live virus.
[01:31:12.389 --> 01:31:15.291]  Injecting all of these flu shots into the body can do that.
[01:31:15.791 --> 01:31:19.413]  And I really think that there's a lot of information that's going to be coming out.
[01:31:19.453 --> 01:31:21.755]  It's the new ploy that the vaccine industry is doing.
[01:31:21.775 --> 01:31:24.917]  I mean, first they used to say you had to vaccinate so you wouldn't get sick.
[01:31:25.217 --> 01:31:29.620]  And then they said, well, you've got to get vaccinated so you can protect everybody around you.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.202]  And then they said, no, you've got to get vaccinated so that it will save money.
[01:31:33.282 --> 01:31:36.404]  So if you get vaccinated and you don't get sick, we won't have to put you in the hospital.
[01:31:36.864 --> 01:31:39.805]  And now they're saying, well, we know all these vaccine reactions are going to happen.
[01:31:39.845 --> 01:31:45.447]  So we're going to look at populations and find out what the baseline incidence is of having things like Guillain-Barre and heart attacks.
[01:31:45.507 --> 01:31:52.430]  And so when we start having flu vaccines that happen and people are getting sick from them, well, we've already got the statistics to say that can't be the flu shot.
[01:31:52.450 --> 01:31:53.490]  It has to be something else.
[01:31:54.071 --> 01:31:57.632]  So it's anything in the world to vaccinate everybody with everything.
[01:31:58.652 --> 01:32:00.112]  We've got every microbe out there.
[01:32:00.132 --> 01:32:06.894]  You know, I always tell people, it's like, if you're living in your house and you have animals, I mean, how many bugs do you think are crawling around in your living room floor?
[01:32:06.914 --> 01:32:09.615]  Do you have dogs or cats or horses or guinea pigs?
[01:32:09.935 --> 01:32:10.935]  Or you go to the playground?
[01:32:10.955 --> 01:32:13.836]  Are you sitting in a, in a, like the conference that we had last night?
[01:32:14.176 --> 01:32:17.397]  The only bugs that we seem to have much concern about are the ones we have vaccines for.
[01:32:17.757 --> 01:32:21.518]  And if you don't have a vaccine for it, then I guess your body does a pretty good job keeping you from
[01:32:21.578 --> 01:32:23.479]  They've got hundreds of vaccines in the pike.
[01:32:23.499 --> 01:32:26.481]  They've gone from a dozen, to 30, to 40, to 50, to 60.
[01:32:26.741 --> 01:32:28.182]  They want to force us to take.
[01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:30.623]  This is an amazing business plan.
[01:32:30.903 --> 01:32:32.664]  Big Pharma comes, lobbies government.
[01:32:33.004 --> 01:32:37.447]  They shove it on you, force it on kids, any captive population, force it on prisoners.
[01:32:38.127 --> 01:32:39.368]  I mean, this is a great business.
[01:32:39.388 --> 01:32:50.698]  Yeah, and there was a report that just came out a couple of days ago that they said by 2014, that's just a couple years away, by 2014, there will be 75 more vaccines that will be all ready to go.
[01:32:50.718 --> 01:32:50.698]  75.
[01:32:52.359 --> 01:32:58.745]  And they're for things like addiction and stop smoking and obesity and all these different... Oh, by the way, I've had scientists on about that.
[01:32:59.125 --> 01:33:04.850]  Some of these anti-drug vaccines where you won't want cigarettes, you won't want cocaine, you won't want opium.
[01:33:05.630 --> 01:33:08.293]  Opiate-type drugs, you know, the painkillers.
[01:33:09.394 --> 01:33:15.760]  They admit that it's a virus that goes in and actually attacks some of the receptors and gives you a type of lobotomy.
[01:33:16.481 --> 01:33:22.227]  And then they have others that attack the chemical reaction in the body and it creates plaques in the brains.
[01:33:22.627 --> 01:33:29.054]  I mean, my God, these new systems I don't even think should be called, and many scientists have said on this show, shouldn't be called vaccines.
[01:33:29.634 --> 01:33:29.854]  I think?
[01:33:47.210 --> 01:33:54.236]  All of those opiates and all of those chemicals, they're mimicking different endorphins, different normal chemicals in the brain.
[01:33:54.276 --> 01:33:56.958]  Dr. Blaylock, top brain scientist, has talked about this here.
[01:33:57.519 --> 01:33:59.620]  And I mean, so now they're setting the precedent.
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:00.541]  I was watching G.I.
[01:34:00.601 --> 01:34:04.624]  Joe, you know, the kids movie the other day on the treadmill, and it was all pro-war propaganda.
[01:34:04.885 --> 01:34:09.669]  But the evil Cobra Commander is injecting people with nanobots that make them their slaves.
[01:34:09.989 --> 01:34:12.331]  Well, that's basically what they're talking about now.
[01:34:12.751 --> 01:34:16.741]  I mean, my God, you're going to take something where you can't even absorb your regular endorphins?
[01:34:17.062 --> 01:34:19.167]  But don't worry, we'll have a drug that replaces that.
[01:34:20.034 --> 01:34:26.697]  Yeah, it's like all that humans have become is a repository for the products of the pharmaceutical industry.
[01:34:27.017 --> 01:34:32.679]  Whether that product is a vaccine or a drug or some other type of chemical, we are a repository for that.
[01:34:32.979 --> 01:34:42.483]  And how much more can we actually keep putting in and putting in and putting in before we have just, it's one big bio-experiment that breaks everybody's health down and we just can't live.
[01:34:42.643 --> 01:34:43.884]  We just can't survive that.
[01:34:45.421 --> 01:35:06.421]  Well, I mean, you've done all this research, and so have major universities, that we are seeing a massive increase in allergies because the vaccines cause an autoimmune response, and it causes all sorts of interactions because of the RNA, the fungus, things that get into the vaccine preparation, and so your body's just fighting, fighting, and starts having responses to everything.
[01:35:06.661 --> 01:35:10.224]  Yeah, and they create things like some of the additives like gelatin.
[01:35:10.244 --> 01:35:17.269]  They know for sure that gelatin that is in some of the flu shots and in the chickenpox vaccine causes allergies and allergic reactions.
[01:35:17.530 --> 01:35:21.673]  They know polysorbate 80 causes allergic reactions and it also can cause anaphylaxis.
[01:35:22.073 --> 01:35:24.055]  It can cause infertility in female mice.
[01:35:24.415 --> 01:35:29.218]  And that additive is in the DPT vaccine and it's in the new Gardasil vaccine.
[01:35:29.579 --> 01:35:35.743]  It's just one big scientific, it's like a big test tube, experimental vaccination petri dish.
[01:35:36.143 --> 01:35:40.486]  And it's as though they can just put more and more and more in us and that seems to be okay.
[01:35:40.606 --> 01:35:51.909]  Well, what about hundreds of peer-reviewed major studies showing that all the different rodents they give vaccines to, different types, develop early onset of unnatural arthritis?
[01:35:52.509 --> 01:35:56.910]  I mean, the reports about people having heart attacks, how does that happen?
[01:35:56.950 --> 01:36:01.171]  I mean, speak about the arthritis and then the cardiovascular problems.
[01:36:01.465 --> 01:36:04.847]  Well, it's really about, there's a bunch of different things.
[01:36:04.887 --> 01:36:06.308]  I like to use the analogy, Alex.
[01:36:06.388 --> 01:36:17.436]  It's sort of like, if you take a little mini bomb, a little, like a little cherry bomb out in your backyard, and you put it underneath a pile of leaves, and you set it off, and then the leaves go boof, and fly up all over the place.
[01:36:17.856 --> 01:36:28.743]  That's kind of what happens when you put a vaccine into your immune system, and into your, all of these cytokine pathways, and how they all talk to each other, just like it blows them up, and just causes everything to go into a disarray.
[01:36:29.103 --> 01:36:31.005]  We can't keep doing this with impunity.
[01:36:31.825 --> 01:36:40.412]  Because our bodies meant to have small amounts of things they beat, not injected directly into it a whole witch's brew of venom.
[01:36:40.452 --> 01:36:50.761]  The new mantra and the new argument in the vaccine world, particularly about mercury, is when they say that you can get more mercury out of eating a can of tuna fish than you can from getting an injection in the vaccine.
[01:36:51.081 --> 01:36:53.643]  That's their new little soundbite to try to dismiss all of this.
[01:36:53.643 --> 01:36:58.828]  We got the CFR clip where they said, we're going to use this and we're going to say there's a shortage.
[01:36:58.928 --> 01:36:59.349]  Exactly.
[01:36:59.369 --> 01:37:01.411]  And they laugh about it, manipulating us.
[01:37:01.591 --> 01:37:02.232]  Yeah, they do.
[01:37:02.772 --> 01:37:06.075]  And it's the differences between ingesting and injecting.
[01:37:06.696 --> 01:37:11.300]  You can ingest a little bit of mercury in a tuna fish and more than likely it's going to go out in your stool.
[01:37:11.581 --> 01:37:15.605]  You inject that into your body, it will eventually get absorbed and go into your brain.
[01:37:16.005 --> 01:37:25.314]  You can ingest fish oils and you can ingest oils like shark oil, but you inject shark oil, which is what the squalene adjuvant is, and it's a completely different ballgame.
[01:37:26.756 --> 01:37:35.484]  And I've read the medical literature, but they describe how mercury bound to food, 99% of it goes out, but injected it goes right over the blood-brain barrier.
[01:37:35.684 --> 01:37:36.005]  Exactly.
[01:37:36.065 --> 01:37:40.349]  And children, am I correct doctor, for the first few years don't have that blood-brain barrier properly?
[01:37:40.808 --> 01:37:43.809]  Well, they do have a blood-brain barrier, but I think it's a little bit leakier.
[01:37:44.169 --> 01:37:47.070]  I mean, they don't have it quite as... it's leakier.
[01:37:47.370 --> 01:37:50.170]  So, the possibility of things going across the blood-brain barrier is higher.
[01:37:50.631 --> 01:37:54.992]  And with the new FluMist vaccine, the one that goes up the nose, that has MSG in it.
[01:37:55.532 --> 01:38:01.653]  So, MSG, which is an acytotoxin in the brain, which can go right up the olfactory nose and right into the brain tissue.
[01:38:01.933 --> 01:38:07.755]  What I'm wanting to know is who's going to follow the brain reactions that could possibly happen down the road from injecting
[01:38:08.636 --> 01:38:10.899]  Big wad of viruses and MSG right up the nose.
[01:38:10.939 --> 01:38:13.822]  But the medical system has an incentive to cover all this up.
[01:38:14.643 --> 01:38:17.547]  I mean, even the doctors who are giving the shots, they want to be in denial.
[01:38:17.587 --> 01:38:18.848]  They don't want to admit they're part of it.
[01:38:19.588 --> 01:38:21.749]  No, and they've got liability protection, too.
[01:38:22.150 --> 01:38:24.451]  I mean, it's anybody that's involved down the line from that.
[01:38:24.491 --> 01:38:28.894]  They all have liability protection for anything that may be going on with the vaccines.
[01:38:29.334 --> 01:38:30.995]  Okay, I want to take calls now.
[01:38:31.096 --> 01:38:32.657]  Please have a quick question or comment.
[01:38:32.697 --> 01:38:36.859]  I'm sure we'll probably have horror stories of people being paralyzed or killed that are flooding in.
[01:38:37.219 --> 01:38:39.921]  But, Ronnie in Texas, you're on the air with Dr. Sherry Tinpenny.
[01:38:39.941 --> 01:38:40.562]  Thanks for calling.
[01:38:41.202 --> 01:38:41.702]  Thanks, sir.
[01:38:41.722 --> 01:38:43.984]  Thanks for the great debate last night, and as a follow-up to
[01:38:44.821 --> 01:38:46.422]  Yes, Ronnie, I appreciate your call.
[01:38:46.442 --> 01:38:48.743]  We've got to get on the offensive against this whole system.
[01:38:48.804 --> 01:38:50.765]  And he made me think of something.
[01:38:50.845 --> 01:38:57.909]  He just brought up the fact, because I talked to you off air, you said the majority of people were on your side at the event and the undecideds that they woke up by the end of it.
[01:39:14.284 --> 01:39:22.208]  Yeah, I thought that the people that were there last night, that the vast majority of them, they were from the libertarians and they were really on the health freedom side of the equation.
[01:39:22.589 --> 01:39:27.531]  And I think that they were more supportive of vaccine information and vaccine freedom of choice.
[01:39:27.892 --> 01:39:37.057]  And I think that the neutral parties that were there by the time that they were left and they saw the good arguments that we had backed up by sound, decisive things that we said versus kind of the
[01:39:38.097 --> 01:39:42.739]  I would say lame discussions that happened from the health department in the same old status quo.
[01:39:42.779 --> 01:39:46.720]  I think that a lot of people left very enlightened by the information they got last night.
[01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:53.082]  By the way, we're going to take that video conference and post it at PrisonPlanet.tv for the folks over there and then we'll get ripped everywhere else.
[01:39:53.122 --> 01:39:53.582]  That's great.
[01:39:53.923 --> 01:39:55.943]  Jeff in Missouri, do you have a question for our guest?
[01:39:56.643 --> 01:39:57.104]  Yes, I do.
[01:39:57.564 --> 01:40:01.205]  Dr. Tenpenny, I was wondering if, I know you're not a veterinarian, but I was wondering if you knew anything about
[01:40:02.525 --> 01:40:05.247]  The H3N8 dog virus.
[01:40:05.667 --> 01:40:06.387]  I really don't.
[01:40:06.768 --> 01:40:12.872]  You know, there's so much information that needs to be handled and read and assimilated every day from the human side.
[01:40:13.232 --> 01:40:16.215]  I really haven't gotten involved with the animals at all.
[01:40:16.255 --> 01:40:18.817]  I worked for a large animal vet and a small animal vet.
[01:40:19.457 --> 01:40:20.498]  This was 20 years ago.
[01:40:20.979 --> 01:40:24.262]  And I remember them advising people, look, they say give the shot every year.
[01:40:24.422 --> 01:40:25.143]  It's not good.
[01:40:25.223 --> 01:40:26.064]  It can hurt your dog.
[01:40:26.424 --> 01:40:27.946]  Now they're not saying give them every year.
[01:40:28.326 --> 01:40:31.109]  The vaccine makers just went and paid off the Veterinarian Society.
[01:40:31.569 --> 01:40:35.153]  And a lot of major veterinary groups are coming out and saying these vaccines are killing people's dogs.
[01:40:35.213 --> 01:40:35.954]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:36.534 --> 01:40:38.596]  So again, we're marching on every front.
[01:40:38.616 --> 01:40:39.557]  The truth's coming out.
[01:40:39.577 --> 01:40:47.844]  And I think this whole vaccine scare, this whole push for bird flu and swine flu, was really an attempt for them to get back control of the situation.
[01:40:48.064 --> 01:40:50.967]  But I think, like Judo, we took them on and slammed them through the wall.
[01:40:51.567 --> 01:40:52.648]  You agree we're kicking their butt?
[01:40:52.728 --> 01:40:54.209]  I think that was really good.
[01:40:54.890 --> 01:40:55.611]  Yeah, it was.
[01:40:55.671 --> 01:40:56.231]  That was good.
[01:40:56.471 --> 01:40:58.934]  Well, hey, we're discovering our fighting spirit.
[01:40:58.974 --> 01:40:59.674]  Thank you, Jeff.
[01:40:59.954 --> 01:41:01.396]  I'm going quick because I want everybody to get on.
[01:41:01.536 --> 01:41:02.316]  Jim in New York.
[01:41:02.336 --> 01:41:03.678]  You're on the air with Dr. Sherri Tenpenny.
[01:41:03.718 --> 01:41:03.838]  Go.
[01:41:05.819 --> 01:41:09.600]  I talked with the husband of a scientist who works at the Cold Spring Lab.
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:13.521]  They've been together for a long time and actually live there at Cold Spring.
[01:41:13.741 --> 01:41:18.261]  Cold Springs is the eugenics, IBM, bioweapons area, yes.
[01:41:18.301 --> 01:41:18.822]  That's right.
[01:41:18.982 --> 01:41:21.422]  Yeah, she's actually doing research in autism, though.
[01:41:21.982 --> 01:41:27.563]  And when I had this conversation, I said, oh, so she's probably linked up that vaccines have caused this.
[01:41:28.343 --> 01:41:30.064]  And that changed his whole demeanor.
[01:41:30.164 --> 01:41:32.084]  He flat out came out and said,
[01:41:32.577 --> 01:41:33.979]  That is a complete fraud.
[01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:35.502]  There's absolutely no link.
[01:41:37.445 --> 01:41:43.896]  And the theory that they have at Cold Spring, which is what they're trying to prove, is that because men are having
[01:41:46.731 --> 01:41:48.952]  Yes, I've seen those studies.
[01:41:49.172 --> 01:41:50.833]  See, they're eugenicists at Cold Springs.
[01:41:50.853 --> 01:41:51.673]  That's where it was founded.
[01:41:51.713 --> 01:41:54.014]  Hitler got all his plans from Cold Springs, as you know, doctor.
[01:41:54.334 --> 01:41:55.375]  That's what Endgame covers.
[01:41:55.395 --> 01:41:56.615]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:41:56.956 --> 01:42:03.619]  They're saying, oh, we all have bad genetics, and so we need to pass laws to test your genes to see if you can have kids.
[01:42:04.693 --> 01:42:04.933]  Yeah.
[01:42:05.033 --> 01:42:12.859]  And it's true from the studies that boys get it more, from what I've seen, because the mercury genetically passes through to the brain at a higher level.
[01:42:12.899 --> 01:42:13.719]  That's what I've read, is that?
[01:42:13.959 --> 01:42:17.342]  Well, some of it has to do, they think, it has to do with the testosterone levels.
[01:42:17.742 --> 01:42:23.246]  And they think that the higher testosterone has a worse of a problem with the mercury on the brain.
[01:42:23.846 --> 01:42:26.147]  So see, there's a little bit of truth there, but it's, yeah.
[01:42:26.427 --> 01:42:36.769]  But I think that what's really interesting is that when they did the whole Human Genome Project, and they're looking at genes, is what they don't understand is that the gene pool is fluid, and something has to push those genes.
[01:42:37.229 --> 01:42:42.050]  It could be a chemical environment, a vaccine, a toxin, and it's not going to be the same for every person.
[01:42:42.090 --> 01:42:45.771]  Well, the director of Cold Springs had to resign last year for saying blacks weren't human.
[01:42:46.071 --> 01:42:50.092]  Before that was even in the news, I named him as a top eugenicist.
[01:42:50.112 --> 01:42:53.213]  Dr. Watson, in Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:43:00.632 --> 01:43:03.594]  Times are tough, and many of us expect them to get worse.
[01:43:03.855 --> 01:43:06.817]  The warning signs have been everywhere for a very long time.
[01:43:07.037 --> 01:43:09.679]  Therefore, you have no excuse not to be prepared.
[01:43:10.019 --> 01:43:15.964]  If another Great Depression strikes America, how will you excuse your lack of preparation to your loved ones?
[01:43:16.434 --> 01:43:19.516]  There are numerous places you can buy freeze-dried food.
[01:43:19.956 --> 01:43:26.221]  Patriotfood.com is different because our dried food supplies are not sold in fancy tin cans.
[01:43:26.481 --> 01:43:33.426]  Our 25 varieties of bulk food are packaged in heavy-duty, food-grade plastic bags that will last 10 years.
[01:43:33.606 --> 01:43:35.787]  While our competition charges $3,000, we ship to you 135 pounds
[01:43:40.071 --> 01:43:42.713]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:43:42.753 --> 01:43:45.114]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:43:45.274 --> 01:43:47.016]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:44:06.866 --> 01:44:09.529]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:09.549 --> 01:44:15.795]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:15.935 --> 01:44:20.959]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:31.129]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:31.229 --> 01:44:33.331]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:33.571 --> 01:44:34.912]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:35.152 --> 01:44:37.454]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:37.615 --> 01:44:39.476]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:39.756 --> 01:44:44.561]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:44:44.901 --> 01:44:49.685]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:44:49.845 --> 01:44:54.009]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:56.081 --> 01:45:00.305]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[01:45:00.585 --> 01:45:04.649]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Siaga.
[01:45:04.869 --> 01:45:15.319]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[01:45:15.719 --> 01:45:17.941]  These key ingredients not only supply powerful
[01:45:17.961 --> 01:45:18.461]  We're good to go.
[01:45:39.449 --> 01:45:39.730]  Call 1 8 7 7.
[01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.570]  Heal for good 1 8 7 7.
[01:45:40.670 --> 01:45:41.892]  Heal the number for good.
[01:45:41.912 --> 01:45:44.574]  That's 8 7 7 4 3 2 5 4 4 6 or order online at heel for good .com.
[01:45:44.594 --> 01:45:45.736]  That's heel for good .com.
[01:46:07.799 --> 01:46:12.502]  I'm going to talk to Jessica, Tim, and Larry with quick questions here in just a moment.
[01:46:12.522 --> 01:46:17.546]  But Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, Do, Rob Do a couple months ago was up there interviewing her for Fall of the Republic 2.
[01:46:18.407 --> 01:46:21.869]  And he said, you want to come out with t-shirts to fund your operation, plus get the word out.
[01:46:21.929 --> 01:46:23.050]  And she brought me a bunch of them.
[01:46:23.531 --> 01:46:24.871]  They're really good looking shirts.
[01:46:26.012 --> 01:46:27.453]  Uh, vaccine refusenik.
[01:46:27.814 --> 01:46:29.215]  She's given me three of them.
[01:46:29.455 --> 01:46:35.740]  Go to DrTinPenny.com and check out the store there and support the work she's doing.
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:37.301]  In fact, she's wearing one of them right now.
[01:46:37.621 --> 01:46:40.544]  Maybe with that camera we can we can zoom in on these.
[01:46:40.584 --> 01:46:43.065]  This is one that says, uh, forced mandatory
[01:46:44.106 --> 01:46:44.707]  Required.
[01:46:44.727 --> 01:46:45.127]  No.
[01:46:45.167 --> 01:46:46.688]  We're saying no to those.
[01:46:47.028 --> 01:46:48.789]  DrTinPenny.com on the back.
[01:46:48.889 --> 01:46:52.191]  Don't Inject Me is on the back.
[01:46:52.571 --> 01:46:59.195]  Go to DrTinPenny.com and get those and get all our t-shirts, like the Gadsden flag, you name it, at Info Wars.
[01:47:00.576 --> 01:47:02.958]  Because this is walking billboards for the truth.
[01:47:03.318 --> 01:47:06.761]  We've got to bypass the mainstream media and get the job done.
[01:47:06.781 --> 01:47:07.662]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:47:07.702 --> 01:47:13.867]  Doc, that's a good idea and I'm glad you took our advice on that because we all need to fund ourselves to build a bigger platform.
[01:47:14.188 --> 01:47:15.729]  We don't have George Soros funding us.
[01:47:16.089 --> 01:47:17.931]  Jessica in Michigan, you're on the air.
[01:47:18.011 --> 01:47:18.832]  Jessica, go ahead.
[01:47:18.852 --> 01:47:27.039]  Hi, I work at a large hospital here in Grand Rapids and they have made the flu vaccine mandatory this year for the first time.
[01:47:27.666 --> 01:47:32.588]  And I am religiously opposed to that, and I've made that clear to everybody there pretty much.
[01:47:33.188 --> 01:47:48.293]  So this morning, Human Resources approached me after work, and they told me that they have set up an appointment for me to meet with a board, and I have 15 minutes to plead my case to them as to why I should be exempt from the vaccine.
[01:47:48.333 --> 01:47:50.554]  And currently, they're only allowing medical exemption.
[01:47:52.435 --> 01:47:53.476]  Well, say you have an allergy.
[01:47:53.496 --> 01:47:56.119]  But why have a job if you have to take the shot?
[01:48:00.103 --> 01:48:06.749]  You have to sign a paper giving full access to all of your medical records and then they have a committee that reviews that.
[01:48:06.909 --> 01:48:07.950]  Ma'am, this is tyranny.
[01:48:08.110 --> 01:48:09.071]  This is just tyranny.
[01:48:09.211 --> 01:48:10.292]  I totally agree.
[01:48:11.012 --> 01:48:12.073]  What should she do, doctor?
[01:48:12.394 --> 01:48:15.676]  One of the most important things you can do is to try to find some like-minded people.
[01:48:16.137 --> 01:48:24.784]  Find some other people that you can band together with and go collectively as a group because I am sure that in the place where you work that there are other people who want to refuse this vaccine.
[01:48:24.824 --> 01:48:26.025]  Yes, you're isolated.
[01:48:26.045 --> 01:48:27.165]  They want to corner you.
[01:48:27.185 --> 01:48:30.627]  That's why they're forcibly inoculating only elementary kids.
[01:48:30.988 --> 01:48:32.609]  Because they know they're defenseless.
[01:48:33.249 --> 01:48:33.689]  Exactly.
[01:48:33.709 --> 01:48:37.932]  And if you can find some like-minded people, there's already a nursing shortage.
[01:48:37.972 --> 01:48:39.533]  They can't fire or suspend all of you.
[01:48:39.853 --> 01:48:42.034]  So you really need to get together collectively.
[01:48:42.054 --> 01:48:47.077]  And you tell them it's a religious discrimination and that you may have to sue them and they'll back off.
[01:48:48.057 --> 01:48:48.558]  Yeah.
[01:48:48.578 --> 01:48:50.379]  Decide it's against your religion today.
[01:48:50.559 --> 01:48:53.761]  I think that people are going to need to be that strong and stand up for that.
[01:48:54.315 --> 01:49:00.758]  Well, look, they stood up in England, they stood up in Germany, they ordered the doctors to find people that didn't do it.
[01:49:01.198 --> 01:49:03.079]  If they didn't take the shot, the doctors said, we'll just quit.
[01:49:03.659 --> 01:49:04.820]  We've got to learn to say no.
[01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:07.821]  They tried to put GMO food in France, the farmers went crazy.
[01:49:08.501 --> 01:49:10.702]  We've got to grow a backbone like Americans used to.
[01:49:10.722 --> 01:49:12.223]  Ma'am, I'm sorry to hear that's happening to you.
[01:49:12.463 --> 01:49:15.344]  Tim in Ohio, you're on the air with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, go ahead.
[01:49:16.184 --> 01:49:17.445]  Hi Alex, hello Dr. Tenpenny.
[01:49:17.859 --> 01:49:18.439]  Good afternoon.
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:21.782]  I'm right next door to you when you're at home in Lorain County.
[01:49:21.922 --> 01:49:23.523]  Alex, I missed the message with your video, guys.
[01:49:23.583 --> 01:49:25.484]  I could've copped you that interview.
[01:49:25.544 --> 01:49:27.325]  I got all the cameras and all the production equipment.
[01:49:27.365 --> 01:49:27.606]  Okay, great.
[01:49:27.626 --> 01:49:28.586]  You have a question for her, Tim.
[01:49:28.606 --> 01:49:29.347]  We're almost out of time.
[01:49:29.527 --> 01:49:36.912]  Yes, Dr. Tempenny, I noticed on the local stations, Monica Raffens, Stephanie Schaefer, Lee Jordan, Alicia Booth, Dawn Kendrick, none of them will have you on.
[01:49:36.952 --> 01:49:37.192]  Why?
[01:49:38.061 --> 01:49:39.002]  That's pretty interesting.
[01:49:39.042 --> 01:49:41.444]  It's sort of like you're never a prophet in your own town, are you?
[01:49:41.784 --> 01:49:51.391]  But I was on Mike Trevisano a couple of weeks ago on 1100 AM, and I was supposed to be on last Thursday, but got preempted by the military base thing that happened.
[01:49:51.491 --> 01:49:52.332]  Tim, thank you.
[01:49:52.512 --> 01:49:53.953]  Larry, 10-second question.
[01:49:53.993 --> 01:49:54.294]  Hit us.
[01:49:54.634 --> 01:49:55.495]  Larry in Minnesota.
[01:49:56.695 --> 01:49:57.096]  Hi, Alex.
[01:49:57.116 --> 01:49:57.636]  Hi, Sherry.
[01:49:59.466 --> 01:50:06.549]  I'm a Desert Storm vet and a healthcare worker and in a similar position as the girl that just called us just a minute ago.
[01:50:06.569 --> 01:50:07.150]  The goal is 100%.
[01:50:07.250 --> 01:50:10.971]  Any comments about herd immunity and can I get my website out?
[01:50:11.031 --> 01:50:11.852]  I'm a healthcare worker.
[01:50:11.952 --> 01:50:12.992]  I want to get this information.
[01:50:13.012 --> 01:50:15.313]  But Obama says nobody has to take it.
[01:50:15.894 --> 01:50:16.614]  Give your website out.
[01:50:17.555 --> 01:50:20.217]  HealthCareTyranny.com in the Twin Cities, Minnesota.
[01:50:20.237 --> 01:50:20.717]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:50:20.757 --> 01:50:21.318]  God bless you.
[01:50:21.498 --> 01:50:22.499]  Dr. Sherry Tinpenny.
[01:50:22.819 --> 01:50:25.921]  DrSherryTinpenny.com or DrTinpenny.com.
[01:50:26.021 --> 01:50:27.502]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:50:27.602 --> 01:50:28.163]  You're welcome.
[01:50:28.263 --> 01:50:28.803]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:50:28.843 --> 01:50:33.106]  You are a trooper, a warrior, an Amazon princess in the fight against tyranny.

[01:50:36.309 --> 01:50:36.769]  Great job.
[01:50:37.790 --> 01:50:39.651]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:50:45.629 --> 01:50:48.551]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:50:49.011 --> 01:50:52.172]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:50:52.633 --> 01:50:56.995]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:50:57.195 --> 01:51:02.798]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:51:03.078 --> 01:51:07.582]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:51:07.862 --> 01:51:10.905]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:51:11.485 --> 01:51:15.889]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:51:16.309 --> 01:51:17.951]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms...
