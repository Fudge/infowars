[00:00:00.645 --> 00:00:27.956]  On a lonely, lonesome highway East of Omaha You listen to the engine moaning out his one old song You think about the woman
[00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:41.997]  Alright, I'm doing a big news blitz, so continue with your phone calls at 1-800-C-5-9-92-31.
[00:00:42.017 --> 00:00:48.301]  We're going to be simulcasting for the next 2 hours and 27 minutes that we have left in this syndicated broadcast.
[00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:05.161]  We normally simulcast the last two hours at PrisonPlanet.tv, but some days we simulcast more, obviously.
[00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:07.462]  Big news blitz coming up right now.
[00:01:07.502 --> 00:01:21.466]  I want to hit what's really happening in Iran and in North Korea right now, and how on this global grand chess board all of this feeds in and is connected.
[00:01:23.547 --> 00:01:26.448]  The establishment crafts its propaganda to be very
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.767]  Lowbrow, very simple, targeting the largest swath of the population, the lowest common denominator.
[00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:48.219]  And so, John Bolton, Zbigniew Brzezinski, all the planners from Bush and Obama, are all publicly bragging that they're staging all this in Iran right now.
[00:01:51.362 --> 00:01:53.944]  But they're like the match that lights the fire.
[00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:58.660]  The fire takes on a life of its own.
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.583]  And the people rioting have some legitimate claims.
[00:02:02.983 --> 00:02:04.544]  So this isn't a black and white issue.
[00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:11.089]  You have to pull back geopolitically and decide what is most moral to support, what is most moral to do.
[00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.212]  And I have wrestled with this, that's why for a week I said I couldn't really comment.
[00:02:16.653 --> 00:02:20.716]  I said my heart is with the protesters, but I said that can be deceiving.
[00:02:21.896 --> 00:02:26.560]  What's being presented is a fog of disinformation and war.
[00:02:27.793 --> 00:02:29.235]  But now we have a very clear picture.
[00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:40.773]  And so, over a week into the rioting and death, on both sides, I can comment on that, and North Korea, just the situation is very, very grave, very, very serious.
[00:02:41.607 --> 00:02:47.891]  Rivaling the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1960s, we've seen nothing of this magnitude since then.
[00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:56.476]  And it's clear on every front the New World Order is launching offensives against free humanity on the grand chess board, trying to take out the last few countries they don't control.
[00:02:56.977 --> 00:02:58.218]  Obviously North Korea is horrible.
[00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:01.139]  Obviously the Mulas are corrupt and do a lot of bad stuff.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.461]  They're not as sophisticated or one-tenth as evil as the globalists.
[00:03:05.382 --> 00:03:11.326]  And not a threat to this nation, certainly, but the issue is, the globalists can go, oh look, we're fighting North Korea, we're fighting the mullahs.
[00:03:11.706 --> 00:03:13.327]  Why is that happening now, though?
[00:03:13.347 --> 00:03:14.108]  What's the bigger picture?
[00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.571]  And what is the history?
[00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:23.934]  And of course, the mullahs are in about five different blocks as well, and constantly fighting with each other.
[00:03:26.035 --> 00:03:34.421]  So, I can criticize the mullahs that are hereditarily related to Mohammed,
[00:03:36.977 --> 00:03:38.959]  But then, it's almost like a legislature.
[00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:45.383]  It's like a royal system, but it's also legislative because the system votes their own people in and out.
[00:03:46.464 --> 00:03:48.306]  And then they, of course, do allow free elections.
[00:03:48.326 --> 00:03:49.226]  That's been documented.
[00:03:49.847 --> 00:03:51.868]  So it's a very, very strange system they created.
[00:03:51.888 --> 00:04:05.239]  But if you're going to criticize it, because it is bloodline related, you can't be on these councils unless you're related to Mohammed from Saudi Arabia.
[00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:06.320]  What's Saudi Arabia today?
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.660]  Mecca.
[00:04:09.141 --> 00:04:11.302]  You know, the problem is you try to give people a detailed breakdown.
[00:04:11.342 --> 00:04:12.243]  It's so complex.
[00:04:12.483 --> 00:04:15.925]  That's why it's just easy for the government to go, oh, look, they're killing innocent women.
[00:04:16.286 --> 00:04:17.186]  Let's attack them.
[00:04:17.826 --> 00:04:18.947]  Oh, yes, with smart bombs.
[00:04:18.987 --> 00:04:21.209]  So, oh, smart bomb hit the wrong building, killed 300.
[00:04:21.429 --> 00:04:24.571]  Oh, another hit a car and killed 50 around it.
[00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.792]  Yeah, little kids' arms and legs blown off.
[00:04:26.852 --> 00:04:28.093]  We're not going to show you the little kids.
[00:04:28.413 --> 00:04:35.418]  You know, there are those videos out on the web of a little kid with his bottom half blown off, crawling, and then the lights going out of his eyes.
[00:04:36.198 --> 00:04:37.358]  Like a lightbulb turning off?
[00:04:37.378 --> 00:04:38.639]  I mean, we could show you that.
[00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:42.260]  We don't show you that to make you be anti-war, because it's so horrid.
[00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:46.582]  We are forced to show the footage they're showing on CNN.
[00:04:46.622 --> 00:04:54.885]  And Fox, though, in many cases unedited, been watching CNN this morning, sometimes they show her dying and the blood pouring out, and other times they blur the face.
[00:04:54.925 --> 00:04:57.446]  So, I don't know what the PSYOP is there.
[00:04:57.466 --> 00:05:03.768]  Or it may just be different producers call on it.
[00:05:03.808 --> 00:05:05.329]  But we're going to show you the unedited video.
[00:05:06.883 --> 00:05:09.986]  Some people distrust the media so much they're saying it's fake.
[00:05:10.166 --> 00:05:20.076]  If it's fake, we know Jerry Bruckheimer on record staged the rescue of Jessica Lynch.
[00:05:20.096 --> 00:05:20.816]  Jessica Lynn.
[00:05:21.036 --> 00:05:21.817]  Time passes.
[00:05:22.318 --> 00:05:24.179]  Who was the girl?
[00:05:24.239 --> 00:05:24.880]  Jessica Lynch?
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.581]  Yeah, Lynch.
[00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:26.722]  I mean, that's admitted.
[00:05:26.742 --> 00:05:30.645]  Jerry Bruckheimer told the BBC that Iraqis saved her.
[00:05:31.732 --> 00:05:31.952]  The U.S.
[00:05:31.972 --> 00:05:32.973]  has already taken over that area.
[00:05:33.013 --> 00:05:38.917]  The Iraqi doctors came to their checkpoint and said, we have an American here and some dead from the shootout on the road.
[00:05:39.317 --> 00:05:40.658]  The Republican Guard has pulled back.
[00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:42.580]  So they said, OK, we'll be there in a little while.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.362]  Sent troops, met with them, said, OK, we're going to come get the bodies.
[00:05:45.882 --> 00:05:48.524]  And then staged kicking in the doors and beating up the doctors.
[00:05:48.584 --> 00:05:50.405]  And, you know, the doctors were in there trying to kill her.
[00:05:51.446 --> 00:05:54.128]  And then Lynch later said, no, they saved us and this is all fake.
[00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:57.050]  And I didn't fight the people off.
[00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.511]  They wanted to sell women in the military.
[00:06:00.896 --> 00:06:04.417]  Then the family of the people that actually did fight the Republican Guard off and got killed.
[00:06:04.437 --> 00:06:07.858]  A Hispanic gentleman, they came and murdered some of those families.
[00:06:07.878 --> 00:06:08.758]  I remember this was in the news.
[00:06:09.718 --> 00:06:18.821]  People that survived in her unit would be cooking hamburgers in their backyard in Phoenix and a guy in a black uniform would pop up and double tap him in the head from 25 yards.
[00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:20.261]  Special ops murders.
[00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:22.862]  That was in the news at the time, but I'm already digressing.
[00:06:23.702 --> 00:06:27.543]  You see fake stuff like that, but Bruckheimer I don't think could do
[00:06:29.372 --> 00:06:31.574]  A woman dying and the light going out of her eyes like this.
[00:06:31.634 --> 00:06:38.018]  If you haven't seen somebody die up close, and I've seen it repeatedly, you don't know reality when you're seeing it.
[00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.362]  Now they could have morphed over a woman's face, another woman dying in a hospital of a car wreck or something.
[00:06:43.382 --> 00:06:44.804]  You know, they got tricks.
[00:06:45.564 --> 00:06:50.508]  But it's hard to fake somebody really dying.
[00:06:50.908 --> 00:06:53.050]  All the Hollywood movies I've seen when somebody goes,
[00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.791]  You know, and dies.
[00:06:55.111 --> 00:07:09.124]  They're trying to fake it, but it just isn't like watching the soul go out of somebody, the essence.
[00:07:10.385 --> 00:07:12.607]  Anybody who's seen somebody die up close has seen it.
[00:07:14.861 --> 00:07:17.403]  And their eyes will be open, and you'll literally just see the light go out.
[00:07:18.524 --> 00:07:19.965]  There's something, like, coming out.
[00:07:20.525 --> 00:07:21.746]  But, side issue.
[00:07:21.766 --> 00:07:22.587]  Very, very touching.
[00:07:22.607 --> 00:07:23.387]  Very, very poignant.
[00:07:24.088 --> 00:07:27.810]  And I'm sure she thought when she was out there protesting that it was a great thing she was doing.
[00:07:29.051 --> 00:07:30.312]  You can't help but support her.
[00:07:31.153 --> 00:07:38.818]  And it's designed so that they can bomb all the water treatment plants, and all the schools, and all the colleges, and kill over a million, just like Iraq.
[00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:43.382]  Well, they've killed a million, three hundred thousand in Iraq, according to British medical journal Lancet.
[00:07:44.377 --> 00:07:46.358]  It was non-partisan and highly respected.
[00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:53.022]  And Iran has almost... It's more than double.
[00:07:53.643 --> 00:07:54.603]  It's almost triple.
[00:07:57.025 --> 00:07:59.386]  They got almost three times the population of Iraq.
[00:08:00.967 --> 00:08:01.648]  And when the U.S.
[00:08:01.688 --> 00:08:09.673]  funded the attack on Iran in the 80s, that killed over a million and a half Iranians and 300,000 Iraqis.
[00:08:09.693 --> 00:08:10.914]  So the Iranians won't give up.
[00:08:11.892 --> 00:08:22.541]  So I'd probably say that if they just bombard them, it'll kill, to blow up their infrastructure, sixty, seventy thousand.
[00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:27.685]  But if they actually do some type of big civil war or invasion out of Iraq, millions, millions.
[00:08:30.087 --> 00:08:36.592]  And so you gotta ask yourself, you want to get all emotional and call for the attack on Iran?
[00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:44.020]  Do you want to, say, turn into a glass parking lot because that woman died?
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.141]  How about we nuke?
[00:08:45.241 --> 00:08:47.342]  Because they're talking about using nukes against Iran.
[00:08:49.204 --> 00:08:50.104]  How about we kill a million?
[00:08:50.525 --> 00:08:51.886]  Because this one woman's dead.
[00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:55.008]  How about we kill whole houses full of kids and whole houses full of women?
[00:08:55.048 --> 00:09:05.596]  See, they always dehumanize the Iraqis and never show you on the news the dead kids and the dead families and the troops sitting off the side of the road shooting truckloads of families and laughing about it as the families fall out dead.
[00:09:06.971 --> 00:09:09.613]  And the military says, well, the troops thought they were threatened by the family.
[00:09:10.053 --> 00:09:11.534]  And on the audio, they're laughing.
[00:09:14.116 --> 00:09:18.699]  But see, when they want to make them humans, oh, look at this beautiful young lady.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:24.243]  And they'll show the Iranian people, and folks are like, well, they look like us.
[00:09:25.484 --> 00:09:26.385]  Or a lot like us.
[00:09:26.445 --> 00:09:30.048]  They look, you know, like clean-cut, sharp, smart people.
[00:09:32.595 --> 00:09:37.439]  I thought they were saying, you know, in words, glass parking lot.
[00:09:37.979 --> 00:09:40.461]  You know, it's this sickening attitude.
[00:09:40.541 --> 00:09:41.282]  Let's nuke them.
[00:09:41.682 --> 00:09:45.065]  But see now, oh, our humanity, oh, oh.
[00:09:46.125 --> 00:09:48.447]  Meanwhile, the police are being overrun.
[00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:51.910]  The revolution looks like it's being beaten back for now, but you never know.
[00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.331]  This staged color revolution.
[00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:57.154]  They're attacking and killing police, beating them to death all over the country on video.
[00:09:58.417 --> 00:10:05.581]  And the police, when huge crowds are climbing up the barricades, setting buildings on fire, are selectively shooting people to drive them back.
[00:10:08.423 --> 00:10:10.784]  And that's how the revolution in Lexington and Concord began.
[00:10:14.606 --> 00:10:23.731]  But that was a real revolution of the colonies, and you better believe that Sam Adams was there manipulating the whole situation.
[00:10:27.352 --> 00:10:31.795]  But he believed their cause was right, they wanted to have the confrontations, they wanted to get the fight started.
[00:10:32.475 --> 00:10:35.797]  So you've got to morally decide who's running this fight and is it moral?
[00:10:36.457 --> 00:10:55.629]  And when you find out the CIA and the New World Order are the ones putting an IQ reducer in your tap water, the ones shooting your kids up with mercury and saying mercury's good for children's brains on the news, when you realize they're the ones, no doubt, orchestrating this, the CIA even picking the color green, because that's the Islamic color, this guy's an Islamicist insider,
[00:10:56.971 --> 00:11:06.295]  The guy tied into the CIA on record from the Iran-Conference situation as the Foreign Minister making the Iran-Conference deal, even beforehand.
[00:11:07.135 --> 00:11:10.496]  He's the main spook of anybody in the Iranian government.
[00:11:10.796 --> 00:11:13.457]  This is the guy the most hooked up with the West.
[00:11:15.718 --> 00:11:20.240]  And so you've got to ask yourselves, why are they showing you this woman and not
[00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:33.005]  The videos of women being shot with 50 cals for target practice entertainment at 2,000 yards away, as described by newspapers like the London Guardian, London Telegraph, in front
[00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:48.122]  British reporters, US Marines, with 50 cows, shot a woman with a three-year-old, holding her hand, walking down the desert path, and just made a bet in front of them about, I bet I can blow her effing head off, and then did it.
[00:11:48.803 --> 00:11:53.707]  It was described in the paper by the news, and the newspaper people attacked the Marines and said, what's your problem?
[00:11:53.947 --> 00:11:58.031]  And the Marines screamed, we'll kill more effing little children, we love it.
[00:11:59.241 --> 00:12:01.462]  And it described the devil tattoos and everything on them.
[00:12:01.522 --> 00:12:02.602]  I mean, this is evil.
[00:12:02.963 --> 00:12:08.425]  And the reporters had souls and were like, you just blew that woman's head off like she was a watermelon you bought at the store.
[00:12:10.406 --> 00:12:14.027]  And, you know, shot with a 30-odd-6 to watch it shatter.
[00:12:16.808 --> 00:12:18.409]  Or like a milk jug full of water.
[00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:26.711]  When I was a kid growing up, we used to go down to the farm, my dad would put a little gasoline in the milk carton, stick a rag in it, light it, and shoot it.
[00:12:26.971 --> 00:12:27.371]  Boom!
[00:12:27.411 --> 00:12:29.332]  You know, had a little fun with the milk carton.
[00:12:29.372 --> 00:12:33.594]  Now let's do it with a woman, with a three-year-old, she's holding by the hand.
[00:12:33.834 --> 00:12:35.155]  This is confirmed!
[00:12:36.644 --> 00:12:38.346]  Oh, but you're not going to want to hear about that.
[00:12:39.247 --> 00:12:48.596]  You want to hear about this so you can then hate the Iranians and go in there and blow that country back to kingdom come, just like Serbia, just like Iraq.
[00:12:48.736 --> 00:12:57.044]  Anybody tries to build their own country, that's a first world nation, 65% urbanized, Tehran looks like New York City in the mountains.
[00:12:58.065 --> 00:12:58.505]  Gorgeous.
[00:12:59.606 --> 00:13:00.107]  Go look at it.
[00:13:04.192 --> 00:13:06.233]  But see, they gotta have their water fluoridated.
[00:13:06.273 --> 00:13:07.213]  They gotta eat GMO.
[00:13:07.233 --> 00:13:08.313]  They gotta have that light.
[00:13:09.174 --> 00:13:13.495]  They look like people in old photos from the 30s and 40s that have that light in their eyes that are awake and alive.
[00:13:13.875 --> 00:13:15.696]  You look at Americans, it's like, because we're drugged out.
[00:13:15.936 --> 00:13:16.836]  We're entertained out.
[00:13:18.476 --> 00:13:19.577]  We don't have that spark, folks.
[00:13:19.597 --> 00:13:21.377]  They're in Serbia now.
[00:13:21.417 --> 00:13:22.378]  They fluoridated their water.
[00:13:22.798 --> 00:13:25.339]  Oh, we invaded just to do this because we care about you.
[00:13:25.559 --> 00:13:27.379]  You're not going to complain anymore after this.
[00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:28.300]  Drink up.
[00:13:31.261 --> 00:13:32.561]  You understand how diabolical this is?
[00:13:35.282 --> 00:13:36.803]  Let's go ahead and read you some of this.
[00:13:36.823 --> 00:13:37.724]  I'm going to play the video.
[00:13:38.224 --> 00:13:43.807]  Iran fury as YouTube screens last moments of women shot dead at Democratic rallies.
[00:13:43.827 --> 00:13:48.751]  See, they're using Twitter, which they admit the CIA was pushing these Twitters out day one.
[00:13:49.231 --> 00:13:50.552]  John Bolton's bragging about it.
[00:13:50.612 --> 00:13:58.237]  I had Dr. Paul Greg Roberts on for 45 minutes, former Wall Street Journal editor, syndicated columnist, as he went through all the admissions.
[00:13:58.697 --> 00:14:03.240]  The White House admits Bush and Obama, they're running these covert ops at destabilization.
[00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.852]  Now, the kids have been oppressed.
[00:14:06.892 --> 00:14:08.573]  There is oppression there, like any government.
[00:14:08.713 --> 00:14:09.474]  I'm not defending it.
[00:14:10.195 --> 00:14:12.156]  The issue is, this is a false revolution.
[00:14:13.557 --> 00:14:17.180]  And these kids don't understand, they don't intend their revolution to win.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:24.645]  It is meant to make Iran look bad in the American people and British people's eyes, and Europeans' eyes, so
[00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:30.092]  There can be a bombardment of Iran using many nukes that Israel says they're getting ready to do.
[00:14:30.732 --> 00:14:32.833]  Remember Jerome Corsi, I want to get back on about this.
[00:14:33.713 --> 00:14:39.915]  That guy's all hooked up into this stuff and he's like suddenly about a year ago, oh I don't want to attack Iran now Alex.
[00:14:39.955 --> 00:14:41.975]  He had been back when that was the Bush policy.
[00:14:42.475 --> 00:14:46.656]  Then he shifts to, oh no we need to fund the revolution because the Iranian people don't like their government.
[00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:48.377]  Which a lot of them, it's true.
[00:14:49.551 --> 00:14:52.453]  But the issue is the globalists don't have something good in mind for Iran.
[00:14:52.834 --> 00:14:54.215]  They have something bad in mind.
[00:14:54.455 --> 00:14:56.737]  Dehumanization, destruction of their infrastructure.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:08.306]  So, going over this story, Iran furious, YouTube screens last moments of woman shot dead at democracy rally.
[00:15:09.667 --> 00:15:14.671]  An Iranian woman looks up at the camera as she lies dying on the streets of Tehran after Saturday's democratic protest.
[00:15:16.462 --> 00:15:18.263]  Blood starts to pour from her mouth and her nose.
[00:15:18.303 --> 00:15:19.224]  Yeah, she gets hit in the heart.
[00:15:19.624 --> 00:15:20.504]  Aorta's blowing.
[00:15:20.865 --> 00:15:21.765]  It's going into her lungs.
[00:15:22.185 --> 00:15:22.966]  It's just, it's horrible.
[00:15:23.406 --> 00:15:24.167]  And boy, you can tell.
[00:15:24.927 --> 00:15:25.567]  She's been hit.
[00:15:26.208 --> 00:15:27.789]  She's realizing, oh my God.
[00:15:27.809 --> 00:15:31.571]  And just her eyes just blaze with life force.
[00:15:31.811 --> 00:15:33.492]  It's just like a sun when it's about to burn out.
[00:15:33.852 --> 00:15:36.014]  First, it gets real bright, or a light bulb.
[00:15:36.234 --> 00:15:38.235]  When it's about to burn out, it gets real bright.
[00:15:38.695 --> 00:15:39.736]  The universe is all the same.
[00:15:39.976 --> 00:15:41.357]  Just like, our eyes go.
[00:15:42.677 --> 00:15:44.779]  Like I'm young, I wanted to have kids, I wanted to live!
[00:15:44.799 --> 00:15:47.881]  And they go... She's dead.
[00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:48.922]  I mean, it's very touching.
[00:15:50.543 --> 00:15:51.784]  So we're going to go ahead and roll this tape.
[00:15:51.824 --> 00:15:52.805]  Here it is, unedited.
[00:15:52.945 --> 00:15:54.446]  Are we playing the CNN or the raw footage?
[00:15:55.167 --> 00:15:56.168]  Raw footage, go ahead and roll it.
[00:16:01.183 --> 00:16:01.844]  Don't shoot!
[00:16:01.864 --> 00:16:02.624]  Don't shoot!
[00:16:02.664 --> 00:16:03.885]  Don't shoot!
[00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:37.302]  Yeah, you can't fake that.
[00:16:38.022 --> 00:16:51.646]  Now, when they bombard Iran, there's little kids laying dead everywhere, and there's dead women all over the place, and there's people screaming and crying.
[00:16:51.666 --> 00:16:52.706]  You're not going to see it on the news.
[00:16:53.592 --> 00:16:55.253]  You're just going to see BOOM!
[00:16:55.353 --> 00:16:55.773]  BOOM!
[00:16:55.833 --> 00:16:56.854]  As buildings are blowing up.
[00:16:57.174 --> 00:16:58.135]  Pull up shock and awe.
[00:16:58.955 --> 00:17:01.857]  Pull up the 2003 bombardment of Baghdad for folks.
[00:17:02.517 --> 00:17:05.879]  You're going to get to sit back and pop beer, and bastards kill that girl!
[00:17:06.139 --> 00:17:07.180]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:14.244]  And you're going to sit there while people are dying by the hundreds every time one of those 2,000 pound bombs goes off.
[00:17:17.145 --> 00:17:19.787]  And the United States government, hijacked by the foreign bankers,
[00:17:20.982 --> 00:17:36.794]  admits on record that they're funding four Al-Qaeda groups, four Al-Qaeda groups inside Iran, which is Shiite, the opposite group of Islam, to destabilize them.
[00:17:36.914 --> 00:17:41.918]  Blowing up mosques, bombing school buses, killing whole mosques full of people, blown to bits.
[00:17:42.779 --> 00:17:46.722]  Oh, but that's on Iranian TV, that's not on TV here.
[00:17:47.884 --> 00:17:49.986]  And our criminal government admits they're doing it.
[00:17:50.387 --> 00:17:51.428]  Like, do something, Iran.
[00:17:51.828 --> 00:17:52.289]  Do something.
[00:17:52.329 --> 00:17:52.689]  Do something.
[00:17:52.709 --> 00:17:53.490]  We're gonna nuke you.
[00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:55.172]  Oh, you won't fight back.
[00:17:55.212 --> 00:17:56.393]  We're gonna fund a revolution.
[00:17:59.295 --> 00:18:00.355]  Economy have you down?
[00:18:00.555 --> 00:18:02.096]  Scared you might lose your job?
[00:18:02.236 --> 00:18:04.136]  Worried how you will provide for your family?
[00:18:04.316 --> 00:18:06.237]  Do you worry where your money will come from?
[00:18:06.437 --> 00:18:09.438]  You know that the economy is getting worse, but there is hope!
[00:18:09.738 --> 00:18:14.019]  Robert Beatles' new book, Here's What You Do, tells you what to do and how to do it!
[00:18:14.279 --> 00:18:17.600]  Even a 10-year-old can figure it out after reading this 72-page book!
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.540]  And the best part?
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.481]  This book is priced under $10!
[00:18:20.761 --> 00:18:22.401]  Don't be the victim, be a victor!

[00:18:26.662 --> 00:18:27.923]  Again, hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:18:28.843 --> 00:18:30.324]  Wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[00:18:30.444 --> 00:18:34.747]  Is your financial advisor experienced enough to combat rising interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[00:18:50.397 --> 00:18:50.437]  877-479-8178.
[00:19:00.023 --> 00:19:05.325]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:19:06.045 --> 00:19:11.386]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:19:11.926 --> 00:19:18.088]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:19:18.428 --> 00:19:20.249]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:19:20.389 --> 00:19:22.791]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:33.819]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.321]  It's not about left or right.
[00:19:37.721 --> 00:19:39.122]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:19:39.583 --> 00:19:45.807]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:19:54.743 --> 00:19:55.904]  The Obama Deception.
[00:19:56.324 --> 00:19:57.585]  The people strike back.
[00:20:00.687 --> 00:20:10.914]  The New World Order beast is genetically modifying your food, mixing vegetables with animals, and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:20:11.852 --> 00:20:17.354]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:20:17.835 --> 00:20:21.016]  Starve or surrender.
[00:20:21.316 --> 00:20:26.158]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:20:26.178 --> 00:20:27.279]  What then?
[00:20:29.045 --> 00:20:31.847]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:20:32.127 --> 00:20:36.289]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[00:20:36.429 --> 00:20:39.311]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.

[00:21:04.497 --> 00:21:22.647]  I haven't even gotten into the North Korea situation.
[00:21:22.667 --> 00:21:24.508]  New rule overs moving on all fronts.
[00:21:25.609 --> 00:21:28.510]  They're moving here domestically saying all protest is terror.
[00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:29.711]  That's another thing.
[00:21:30.885 --> 00:21:32.385]  You see this poor woman get killed.
[00:21:32.485 --> 00:21:37.326]  I've got lots of footage of cops beating Americans and British to death and shooting you with rubber bullets and killing you.
[00:21:37.926 --> 00:21:42.567]  And footage of cops shooting Americans handcuffed in the back and then not getting in trouble.
[00:21:45.447 --> 00:21:50.148]  Remember this woman dies after head injuries sustained after Red Sox win.
[00:21:50.228 --> 00:21:51.408]  Talk about a way of spinning it.
[00:21:51.709 --> 00:21:52.769]  We could play the video of this.
[00:21:53.729 --> 00:21:56.829]  Cops walk up, shoot her at less than ten feet in the face.
[00:21:57.129 --> 00:21:59.950]  She was walking out of a bar, journalism student, no criminal record.
[00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:05.113]  And the cop, maybe we should pull that up, shoots her right in the face with a rubber bullet shotgun.
[00:22:05.834 --> 00:22:09.516]  He knows he's not supposed to shoot you any more than 35-40 feet, depending on the load.
[00:22:09.536 --> 00:22:11.518]  I mean, they know that kills people.
[00:22:11.558 --> 00:22:12.118]  He didn't care.
[00:22:12.619 --> 00:22:14.760]  He shot her, her eye went back in her brain, she died.
[00:22:15.261 --> 00:22:16.942]  Now, you're not going to see that.
[00:22:17.122 --> 00:22:17.923]  She died in minutes.
[00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:20.625]  You're not going to see, you know, up-close video footage.
[00:22:20.645 --> 00:22:23.387]  The police fought to not release their own internal video.
[00:22:23.427 --> 00:22:24.067]  I never saw that.
[00:22:24.107 --> 00:22:27.790]  I saw chopper video of him, like, 10 feet away, shooting her right in the face.
[00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:28.711]  I mean, right in the face.
[00:22:29.031 --> 00:22:29.891]  She comes walking out.
[00:22:30.712 --> 00:22:31.872]  He thinks it's a video game?
[00:22:31.912 --> 00:22:33.072]  He wants to have some fun tonight?
[00:22:33.112 --> 00:22:35.073]  He's bored in this Storm Trooper outfit?
[00:22:35.153 --> 00:22:35.893]  You die, lady!
[00:22:36.433 --> 00:22:39.594]  Now, are we going to have a foreign government bombard the entire United States?
[00:22:40.114 --> 00:22:41.354]  Is this because they killed this woman?
[00:22:43.854 --> 00:22:55.857]  Again, we don't know who shot this woman in the chest, but we know at these rallies, if you pull back with the footage, they're burning cars, burning buildings, moving up, attacking and beating the police to death.
[00:22:56.937 --> 00:22:57.937]  The police are going to shoot you!
[00:23:01.084 --> 00:23:01.684]  It's gonna happen.
[00:23:03.305 --> 00:23:12.711]  And, again, that's the facts here, is that they want to go bombard Iran and not show you all the dead kids, but they want to show you this woman dying.
[00:23:14.052 --> 00:23:15.313]  Show them shock and awe, folks.
[00:23:15.973 --> 00:23:22.457]  Now, they don't show you the up-close people getting killed when it's the globalist attack on a country.
[00:23:24.699 --> 00:23:26.960]  They will only show you from a distance.
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.782]  And it's like, oh, look at the fireworks display, honey.
[00:23:32.288 --> 00:23:32.608]  Oh, look!
[00:23:32.648 --> 00:23:34.189]  Flashes in the night sky!
[00:23:34.709 --> 00:23:34.849]  Oh!
[00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:38.851]  How dare those Iraqis shoot their primitive anti-aircraft up into the sky!
[00:23:39.271 --> 00:23:40.592]  Those dirty terrorists!
[00:23:40.952 --> 00:23:43.573]  We're only blowing up all their... Oh, there you go!
[00:23:46.134 --> 00:23:48.756]  Oh, we blew up a whole apartment building full of men, women, and children.
[00:23:49.456 --> 00:23:49.596]  Oh!
[00:23:50.657 --> 00:23:51.477]  It's just war.
[00:23:51.517 --> 00:23:52.357]  These things happen.
[00:23:54.138 --> 00:24:00.141]  Ah, you know the Japanese, even though they tried to surrender unconditionally, they deserved to have Hiroshima and Nagasaki A-bombed.
[00:24:01.912 --> 00:24:06.977]  Even though the Flying Tigers, for a year and a half before they attacked Pearl Harbor, were attacking them in China.
[00:24:08.839 --> 00:24:08.979]  Oh!
[00:24:09.099 --> 00:24:10.881]  And again, I'm just stating the facts here.
[00:24:11.802 --> 00:24:16.327]  So, it'll be nice, distanced photos of skyscrapers being blown up full of people.
[00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:24.811]  But when it suits them, they'll show you the woman up close gasping and fighting for her life.
[00:24:25.111 --> 00:24:29.293]  I'm going to get into North Korea after some more calls, and then another big huge news blitz.
[00:24:29.713 --> 00:24:34.034]  And I have a Texas State Senator coming on about the police all over the country robbing everybody.
[00:24:34.094 --> 00:24:43.997]  And finally, because of you getting the word out, mainstream media is admitting the new Federal Reserve takeover bill is all over all of government, total dictatorship of the Fed.
[00:24:45.401 --> 00:24:46.442]  We're going to talk about that as well.
[00:24:46.723 --> 00:24:49.547]  So Jim, Beverly, John, Lou, and others, that is coming up.
[00:24:49.567 --> 00:24:51.649]  Before I end this hour, I need to start thanking sponsors.
[00:24:51.689 --> 00:24:54.894]  I only have one sponsor an hour, but I always wait until the end of the show to start plugging them, so I need to...
[00:24:56.101 --> 00:24:57.022]  We need to get to those now.
[00:24:57.882 --> 00:24:59.503]  One of them is efoodsdirect.com.
[00:24:59.523 --> 00:25:02.505]  This is the name in high-quality, storable foods.
[00:25:03.066 --> 00:25:05.748]  They have just incredibly good prices.
[00:25:06.188 --> 00:25:10.651]  Non-GMO, non-hybrid, clean, healthy, grown right here in the United States food.
[00:25:11.211 --> 00:25:12.432]  Really tasty stuff as well.
[00:25:12.452 --> 00:25:12.672]  1-800-409-5633.
[00:25:12.712 --> 00:25:13.012]  Get prepared.

[00:25:20.677 --> 00:25:22.157]  I have bought my storable food from them.
[00:25:22.417 --> 00:25:23.457]  That's why I got them as a sponsor.
[00:25:23.878 --> 00:25:25.258]  I'm like, hey, this is actually good storable food.
[00:25:25.278 --> 00:25:26.238]  The other stuff I bought is junk.
[00:25:26.778 --> 00:25:30.319]  I'll call them and get them as a sponsor.
[00:25:30.339 --> 00:25:31.800]  1-800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.180]  That's efoodsdirect.com.

[00:25:48.985 --> 00:25:50.566]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:25:50.666 --> 00:25:55.287]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:25:55.407 --> 00:25:58.168]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:25:58.368 --> 00:26:01.249]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:26:01.409 --> 00:26:06.131]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:26:06.371 --> 00:26:07.312]  If you simply prepare.
[00:26:07.492 --> 00:26:10.435]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:26:10.735 --> 00:26:17.641]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:26:17.741 --> 00:26:20.864]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:26:36.171 --> 00:26:37.392]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:26:37.452 --> 00:26:38.112]  Take action today.
[00:26:38.152 --> 00:26:39.972]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:53.702]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:26:54.182 --> 00:26:57.023]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:03.426 --> 00:27:04.087]  Big Brother.
[00:27:04.747 --> 00:27:05.807]  Mainstream media.
[00:27:06.508 --> 00:27:07.628]  Government cover-ups.
[00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:09.089]  You want answers?
[00:27:09.849 --> 00:27:10.790]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:15.092]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:15.592 --> 00:27:19.674]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:21.963 --> 00:27:41.539]  Bottom line, the CIA is using a power structure split in Iran as a pretext to then demonize the country worldwide, to make it look like a popular revolution, so they can launch military strikes on them.
[00:27:41.559 --> 00:27:48.605]  The Committee of Experts can kick anybody off the ballot if they want, and so they allow you to run for president,
[00:27:51.178 --> 00:27:53.720]  That means they've already selected you.
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:58.783]  So they let the people choose from who they choose, kind of like what we have here with the big banks owning both parties.
[00:27:59.884 --> 00:28:01.165]  Just a little bit more of the illusion.
[00:28:02.926 --> 00:28:07.830]  And this guy that supposedly said he won, he announced that he'd won hours before the polls even closed.
[00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:09.531]  Classic CIA op.
[00:28:10.011 --> 00:28:13.213]  Remember, the CIA and MIM-6 overthrew Iran in 1953.
[00:28:13.694 --> 00:28:16.796]  The pro-West, Mohammed Mozadek,
[00:28:17.762 --> 00:28:20.305]  Just because he wouldn't give them all the oil money and wanted to modernize the country?
[00:28:20.645 --> 00:28:22.367]  Did they use radical Muslims to do that?
[00:28:22.427 --> 00:28:24.049]  Then bait and switch, put the Shah in?
[00:28:24.469 --> 00:28:28.133]  The Shah's son is running around, wanting to go take back over.
[00:28:28.934 --> 00:28:37.203]  At the press club, it's on CNN, it's just disgusting lies about oppression when his dad killed hundreds and hundreds of thousands with torture under CIA command.
[00:28:38.044 --> 00:28:39.205]  I mean, it's just hypocritical.
[00:28:39.245 --> 00:28:42.166]  Don't call yourselves the good guys, and don't say you're the good guys.
[00:28:43.107 --> 00:28:50.270]  The people running our country, the New World Order running our country, want to destroy our liberties and freedoms, and they'll treat us just like the Iranians, if they can get away with it.
[00:28:51.291 --> 00:28:51.571]  Okay?
[00:28:51.731 --> 00:28:53.312]  Our common enemy is the New World Order.
[00:28:53.492 --> 00:28:55.113]  Does that mean I love all the Mullahs?
[00:28:55.173 --> 00:28:55.373]  No.
[00:28:56.633 --> 00:28:58.154]  Kim Jong-il is another subject.
[00:28:59.055 --> 00:28:59.615]  Pure evil.
[00:28:59.935 --> 00:29:03.437]  Just as evil as the Globalists, just not as smart, not over as big a kingdom.
[00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:07.732]  And they're going to use that little demon as a pretext, so I'm going to cover that after the break.
[00:29:07.772 --> 00:29:08.832]  Right now, let's keep taking calls.
[00:29:09.352 --> 00:29:10.253]  Jim in Ohio.
[00:29:10.273 --> 00:29:11.073]  You're on the air, Jim.
[00:29:11.993 --> 00:29:13.494]  Maranatha, Alex Semper Fi.
[00:29:13.534 --> 00:29:17.815]  I just wanted to tell you that, you know that Green Corps thing that you talked about?
[00:29:19.075 --> 00:29:21.496]  People were joining felons and stuff?
[00:29:21.896 --> 00:29:30.839]  Well, my nephew, he's in the jail right now, and he's qualifying to join that, and he was a former Army Ranger.
[00:29:31.579 --> 00:29:34.180]  And the other thing I saw was a movie on TV the other day.
[00:29:34.758 --> 00:29:36.378]  Called Pentaloot or something like that.
[00:29:36.718 --> 00:29:38.719]  And it was a girl born part pig.
[00:29:39.619 --> 00:29:42.360]  She had a pig nose, pig ears, like that there.
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:46.060]  And as far as the war things goes, these have been going on just like this.
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.001]  You can trace it clear back far in history.
[00:29:48.381 --> 00:29:51.241]  They use people for their bullets and their things to do whatever they want to do.
[00:29:52.262 --> 00:29:53.362]  It's always been done that way.
[00:29:54.022 --> 00:29:55.142]  And thanks for what you're doing.
[00:29:55.322 --> 00:29:55.802]  Maranatha.
[00:29:58.063 --> 00:29:58.783]  Maranatha.
[00:29:58.843 --> 00:29:59.543]  I'm ignorant.
[00:29:59.563 --> 00:30:00.143]  What does that mean?
[00:30:01.603 --> 00:30:03.324]  I remember vaguely what it means.
[00:30:03.424 --> 00:30:03.684]  I can't...
[00:30:04.926 --> 00:30:06.547]  Look at Maranatha, see what that means.
[00:30:07.607 --> 00:30:09.168]  Let's talk to Beverly in Georgia.
[00:30:09.208 --> 00:30:10.108]  Beverly, you're on the air.
[00:30:11.949 --> 00:30:12.329]  Hello?
[00:30:12.949 --> 00:30:13.570]  Yes, Beverly.
[00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:15.811]  Oh, good afternoon, Alex.
[00:30:15.891 --> 00:30:23.754]  I've just got a couple of quick points that I wanted to tell you about, and thank you for waking me up to Ron Paul.
[00:30:23.834 --> 00:30:27.415]  I was honored to volunteer for him when I was living in South Carolina.
[00:30:29.446 --> 00:30:42.172]  You know, you've seen those pictures that went across the internet of Iraqi women and holding up pictures of signs saying, thank you Mr. Bush and thank you America and stuff like that.
[00:30:43.273 --> 00:30:44.233]  You familiar with that?
[00:30:44.774 --> 00:30:46.354]  Yes, in English, all staged.
[00:30:46.975 --> 00:30:47.715]  Right, exactly.
[00:30:47.755 --> 00:30:49.076]  It's now admitted that was all staged.
[00:30:49.116 --> 00:30:51.917]  No, it was run by Ahmed Shalabi on record.
[00:30:52.818 --> 00:30:53.538]  Absolutely.
[00:30:53.618 --> 00:30:57.320]  My cousin is married to one of the spin doctors for the Air Force.
[00:30:58.118 --> 00:31:03.344]  Before that ever went on the internet, it ruined my Christmas to see that one time.
[00:31:03.624 --> 00:31:16.799]  And so if anybody that sees that, and it's still going around, and it's just disgusting that people... Well, they used three-year-old video of Palestinians celebrating an election and said that was them celebrating 9-11.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.461]  It's just all lies.
[00:31:19.002 --> 00:31:19.902]  It sure is.
[00:31:20.383 --> 00:31:21.263]  It sure is.
[00:31:21.323 --> 00:31:31.027]  And people need to understand, whenever I get those pictures now, I write in what I know and I send it around and tell them, you better wake up.
[00:31:31.967 --> 00:31:34.408]  Stay there, stay there, I'm going to come back to you.
[00:31:34.768 --> 00:31:38.870]  By the way, I'm not even trying to prove my point about this being a setup in Iran.
[00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:42.071]  BBC's had to retract, it's admitted, CNN's doing it.
[00:31:42.531 --> 00:31:46.993]  They crop photos of Ahmadinejad supporters and then say,
[00:31:48.052 --> 00:31:49.733]  That they're really supporting his opposition.
[00:31:49.753 --> 00:31:51.413]  I mean, they're just faking everything.
[00:31:52.213 --> 00:31:55.355]  They probably shot this woman themselves, and we're all ready for it.
[00:31:55.375 --> 00:31:56.395]  It's disgusting.
[00:31:59.176 --> 00:32:04.458]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from the resistant new strains of deadly bacteria and viruses?

[00:33:04.571 --> 00:33:05.732]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:33:05.892 --> 00:33:09.835]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called InnerFood.
[00:33:10.155 --> 00:33:11.697]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[00:33:12.017 --> 00:33:18.322]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.

[00:33:24.066 --> 00:33:26.848]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[00:33:27.068 --> 00:33:28.510]  And their formula really works.
[00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:31.352]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.

[00:33:37.856 --> 00:33:40.058]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[00:33:40.278 --> 00:33:42.539]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.481]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[00:33:44.821 --> 00:33:50.310]  Go to www.enerfood.com.

[00:33:58.834 --> 00:34:03.836]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:34:04.056 --> 00:34:07.838]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:34:08.078 --> 00:34:13.681]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:34:13.981 --> 00:34:18.844]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:34:19.044 --> 00:34:19.544]  Number three,
[00:34:19.944 --> 00:34:25.387]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:34:26.248 --> 00:34:28.910]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:32.552]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:34:33.673 --> 00:34:37.275]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:34:37.515 --> 00:34:42.997]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long-time sponsor of ours.
[00:34:43.237 --> 00:34:47.798]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:34:55.841 --> 00:35:04.123]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:35:04.443 --> 00:35:06.724]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:35:09.884 --> 00:35:12.446]  It certainly is a war on four-year mine.
[00:35:12.506 --> 00:35:22.232]  Going back to your phone calls, and I'm going to get into what's happening in the Korean Peninsula, not just Iran, and the larger chessboard.
[00:35:22.252 --> 00:35:24.193]  We've talked about Iran the last 30 minutes or so.
[00:35:24.974 --> 00:35:27.255]  Now I'm going to get into what's happening in Korea.
[00:35:27.936 --> 00:35:36.821]  And this ship is going to be intercepted by the John McCain Sr., or I guess John McCain II, the father of John McCain, the senator, the recent
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:45.343]  Republican presidential candidate, going to intercept the ship, and North Korea says, if you mess with our ship, we're going to launch nuclear weapons.
[00:35:46.584 --> 00:35:48.085]  And their history is, they may do it.
[00:35:48.845 --> 00:35:50.926]  And then the globalists don't have a stage of terror attack.
[00:35:52.347 --> 00:35:54.148]  Kim Jong-il will fire a nuke at Hawaii.
[00:35:55.688 --> 00:35:58.129]  I mean, it just, there's no end to it.
[00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:04.472]  They're just poking the psychopath, who's dying of cancer and had strokes, about to transfer power to his 23-year-old son,
[00:36:06.627 --> 00:36:10.712]  Another example of governments, of communists, of, you know, hereditary power.
[00:36:10.752 --> 00:36:11.673]  Just the corruption!
[00:36:12.975 --> 00:36:16.599]  I'm telling you, in fifty years, if this continues in the U.S., this pad will have kings.
[00:36:16.619 --> 00:36:18.962]  I mean, that's what they do.
[00:36:18.982 --> 00:36:19.803]  That's what they set up.
[00:36:21.124 --> 00:36:22.606]  Okay, going back to Beverly in Georgia.
[00:36:22.626 --> 00:36:23.207]  Go ahead, Beverly.
[00:36:24.048 --> 00:36:26.949]  Yeah, Alex, one other thing I wanted to tell you about.
[00:36:27.469 --> 00:36:30.911]  I was at a recent Blue Grass Festival in South Carolina.
[00:36:31.511 --> 00:36:37.153]  Met a young man by the name of Jesse who was just getting ready to be deployed to Afghanistan.
[00:36:37.453 --> 00:36:40.194]  I think this was going to be his second time there.
[00:36:40.874 --> 00:36:42.595]  This kid is just, he's just a kid.
[00:36:43.582 --> 00:36:55.145]  We were talking a little bit and I asked him if he had ever heard of the Iraqi veterans that were against the war and some of the other groups and about yourself, Ron Paul, and he wasn't.
[00:36:55.685 --> 00:37:06.888]  And as we were talking what little bits that he would talk to me, he looked at me and he had tears in his eyes and he said, if you knew what I knew, and I said, what are you trying to tell me?
[00:37:06.928 --> 00:37:09.789]  Won't you tell me what you want, you know, what's going on?
[00:37:10.706 --> 00:37:12.868]  He said, I never want to go back there.
[00:37:12.948 --> 00:37:14.329]  We don't need to be there.
[00:37:14.989 --> 00:37:15.810]  But I've got to go.
[00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:17.711]  And I said, no, I don't think you've got to go.
[00:37:18.111 --> 00:37:21.874]  I think you need to start looking at some of these groups that are standing up.
[00:37:22.715 --> 00:37:25.457]  And, you know, I don't think he's the only one.
[00:37:25.657 --> 00:37:31.161]  I think a lot of these kids know that something is very wrong and they don't need to be there.
[00:37:31.961 --> 00:37:33.603]  And I really felt for that young man.
[00:37:33.623 --> 00:37:35.044]  Well, God bless you.
[00:37:35.064 --> 00:37:36.064]  I appreciate your call.
[00:37:36.505 --> 00:37:38.706]  Let's talk your call now from John in Missouri.
[00:37:38.746 --> 00:37:39.487]  John, you're on the air.
[00:37:42.489 --> 00:37:50.294]  Thank you for you and your people that are continuing to shine the light on all the cockroaches behind the curtain trying to control our lives.
[00:37:51.075 --> 00:37:52.055]  We're trying our best, sir.
[00:37:52.796 --> 00:38:11.168]  I'm a 54-year-old veteran and when I was going through my training after boot camp, the Shaw had all his sailors and army men going through training in the United States.
[00:38:12.861 --> 00:38:18.945]  There was 10,000 Iranian sailors going through Great Lakes Training Command when I was there myself, and I've met quite a few of them.
[00:38:20.426 --> 00:38:22.467]  And they're just like normal Joes.
[00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:28.991]  They just want to live a life, peaceably, be profitable for their family.
[00:38:29.011 --> 00:38:39.318]  And I just want to put out a word to all the ex-hippies and veterans from my era that haven't been raised on
[00:38:40.842 --> 00:38:44.545]  Fluoridated water and everything else that's trying to control our minds.
[00:38:45.786 --> 00:38:52.490]  Think about everything that's happened back from the time when you were protesting in the streets for what was going on in Vietnam.
[00:38:52.591 --> 00:38:54.412]  We don't need another Vietnam to happen.
[00:38:55.553 --> 00:39:02.277]  We screwed the Vietnamese people after World War II and we're going to end up doing the same mistake with Iraq and now Iran.
[00:39:02.298 --> 00:39:09.743]  It's time to put a stop to this continually revolving door that's taking away our liberties bit by bit.
[00:39:11.346 --> 00:39:14.228]  Time to focus on what the real problem is behind the curtain.
[00:39:15.489 --> 00:39:17.551]  And keep doing the good work.
[00:39:18.092 --> 00:39:19.673]  We don't need to bomb Iran.
[00:39:20.894 --> 00:39:22.536]  We're not seeing the real story.
[00:39:22.576 --> 00:39:24.358]  We're only seeing what they're allowing us to see.
[00:39:25.234 --> 00:39:26.735]  Absolutely, there's no doubt of that.
[00:39:26.835 --> 00:39:33.218]  They're admitting that these four terror groups, that three of them are Wahhabist or Al-Qaeda.
[00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:37.260]  Number three in Al-Qaeda, the White House admits is commanded by the U.S.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.081]  You can't make this type of craziness up.
[00:39:39.601 --> 00:39:44.144]  And they're targeting and killing and bombing the police to get the police to shoot at them.
[00:39:45.024 --> 00:39:47.025]  I mean, Iran has been very restrained.
[00:39:47.105 --> 00:39:47.945]  It's on record.
[00:39:48.545 --> 00:39:54.908]  Our government admits they've been staging terror attacks there, blowing up mosques, trying to get the Muslims all hyped up.
[00:39:55.548 --> 00:39:59.309]  And Iran has been overthrown so many times by the West, they've learned how to deal with this.
[00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:01.310]  And again, I'm not saying they're perfect either.
[00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:02.251]  That's the problem with government.
[00:40:02.271 --> 00:40:02.891]  It's all bad.
[00:40:03.191 --> 00:40:05.392]  North Korea, U.S., you know, the Mullahs, whatever.
[00:40:06.452 --> 00:40:09.134]  But it's clear the aggressor here is the West.
[00:40:09.574 --> 00:40:16.859]  And it's the same aggressor trying to take our rights, saying that Homeland Security thinks you're the number one threat, John.
[00:40:16.879 --> 00:40:18.280]  Yeah, I know.
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.261]  I'm probably on a number of lists already.
[00:40:20.781 --> 00:40:27.325]  In fact, I got a Missouri TV station reporting it like it's good and normal that anybody in the Constitution Party is a terrorist.
[00:40:27.686 --> 00:40:28.266]  That's coming up.
[00:40:28.306 --> 00:40:29.146]  I appreciate your calling.
[00:40:29.166 --> 00:40:29.687]  God bless you.
[00:40:31.348 --> 00:40:32.629]  This isn't our government.
[00:40:33.609 --> 00:40:34.570]  It would be bad enough
[00:40:36.778 --> 00:40:43.662]  To, if we were a tribal, racial country, to go in and murder some neighbors and take over their property.
[00:40:45.363 --> 00:40:47.124]  And that's what most cultures do.
[00:40:47.244 --> 00:40:51.026]  But at least there's a group mind of, we only abuse and kill these neighbors.
[00:40:52.447 --> 00:40:58.310]  But once you have this global society, it's the elites against the people, and they have all these tricks to play us off.
[00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:03.713]  They're waging war, they're engaging in predator behavior on us.
[00:41:07.896 --> 00:41:17.462]  And we have to get out of this tribal mode of, yeah, we're killing that enemy over there that's brown, and realize, no, it's a scientific tyranny that's doing it to all of us together.
[00:41:18.122 --> 00:41:23.345]  And as long as we play along with the game of this tribalism, the globalists are going to keep winning.
[00:41:23.365 --> 00:41:24.626]  We have to get the big picture.
[00:41:24.646 --> 00:41:26.767]  And I'm going to go over that after some more calls coming up.
[00:41:27.568 --> 00:41:28.989]  Let's talk to Lou in Illinois.
[00:41:29.049 --> 00:41:29.809]  Lou, you're on the air.
[00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:33.031]  Alex, thank you very much for taking my call today.
[00:41:33.812 --> 00:41:35.353]  I wanted to thank you for the
[00:41:36.593 --> 00:41:37.614]  That's a great question.
[00:42:05.103 --> 00:42:18.628]  Let me be clear, we would give prisonplanet.tv out for free, but just the bandwidth of all the sites, everything's over 20 grand a month in IT, it's a total of 30 with all the T1 lines and all that.
[00:42:19.188 --> 00:42:24.730]  So we spend all our time just trying to even have the money to pay for all this when I'd rather spend it on news and information.
[00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:26.791]  But that's how the world works, I'm not complaining.
[00:42:27.251 --> 00:42:28.152]  It just holds us back.
[00:42:28.172 --> 00:42:31.113]  That's why we have the money bombs, we don't have to worry so much about this for another year.
[00:42:31.933 --> 00:42:33.174]  It supplements what we're doing.
[00:42:34.923 --> 00:42:36.625]  But that barely pays for the bandwidth alone.
[00:42:37.265 --> 00:42:39.527]  And so, yes, PrisonPlanet.tv memberships.
[00:42:39.547 --> 00:42:46.614]  But more importantly, the films are all in high quality, so you can burn them to disc, to CD, very easy point-and-click tools.
[00:42:47.014 --> 00:42:56.543]  It's an arsenal, an armory of info weapons, you know, basically grenades in the info war, to go in there, burn all the films to disc, give them to people.
[00:42:57.004 --> 00:42:58.726]  Most new DVD players, you know, have the
[00:43:01.369 --> 00:43:20.505]  Yes, and what I'm doing is, one of the things I've learned from you, and what your message was, and what I believe your message was, was to inform people.
[00:43:20.925 --> 00:43:29.152]  Inform your friends, your neighbors, and I want to go about it in a way that I don't represent this like I'm a moron.
[00:43:29.781 --> 00:43:32.683]  And so what I'm doing is I'm studying hard at it.
[00:43:32.743 --> 00:43:36.185]  And my best friend is a Northwestern law graduate.
[00:43:36.225 --> 00:43:38.106]  Well, she's just getting her degree now.
[00:43:38.627 --> 00:43:40.028]  She, this girl is a genius.
[00:43:40.128 --> 00:43:44.010]  And I was talking to her about it and I'm not as well educated.
[00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:47.352]  You know, when I started talking to her, I said, you have to hear this guy.
[00:43:47.712 --> 00:43:49.714]  She heard you and she just flipped out.
[00:43:49.734 --> 00:43:52.415]  She's like, this guy really is smart.
[00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:59.380]  And now she's telling all her friends at Northwestern, you know, and it's kind of spread a little wildfire amongst her friends.
[00:44:00.035 --> 00:44:02.456]  And, you know, I just can't thank you enough.
[00:44:02.537 --> 00:44:11.081]  I really idolize what you're doing and, you know, it's given me a direction in my life as far as... Well, let me just say this, my friend.
[00:44:11.101 --> 00:44:14.323]  I'm going to go ahead and finish, but don't idolize me.
[00:44:14.723 --> 00:44:16.604]  Idolize the successes I've had.
[00:44:17.125 --> 00:44:19.186]  Also, learn from the mistakes I've made.
[00:44:19.206 --> 00:44:21.867]  That's why parents try to teach their kids something they've learned.
[00:44:21.887 --> 00:44:23.268]  It's not that they're high and mighty.
[00:44:23.288 --> 00:44:24.289]  They've been around longer.
[00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:25.750]  They've got the scars to prove it.
[00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:30.173]  Yes, and the last thing is that I have friends of mine that are Polish descent.
[00:44:30.193 --> 00:44:31.354]  They're new to this country.
[00:44:56.488 --> 00:44:58.690]  They're, you know, they want to be good Americans.
[00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:05.275]  And when you go and you start talking this stuff to people, they either think you're nuts or they cannot understand it.
[00:45:05.715 --> 00:45:08.757]  And so I don't know, you know, if this has been said before.
[00:45:08.777 --> 00:45:09.358]  No, no, no.
[00:45:09.418 --> 00:45:10.339]  I'll tell you why the poll.
[00:45:10.379 --> 00:45:11.539]  I mean, I mean, make your point.
[00:45:11.559 --> 00:45:12.780]  I'm gonna tell you what's going on with the polls.
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:13.181]  We'll go ahead.
[00:45:14.059 --> 00:45:18.541]  Yeah, a guide for, you know, info war for dummies.
[00:45:19.062 --> 00:45:41.273]  If it could be simplified, broken down, and give us, maybe someone could write, help write, and give people like me direction of how to get out there, how to go door-to-door in my free time, and spread this information, and, you know, get it going and get off our butts, we can sit here and we can say, yeah, I listen to Alex Jones, I know what's going on.
[00:45:41.633 --> 00:45:48.577]  But the doing of it, getting out there and doing it and informing these people... No, I agree, I agree, but I mean, don't wait to inform people.
[00:45:48.597 --> 00:45:50.799]  You don't have to have some perfect handbook or have all the answers.
[00:45:51.079 --> 00:45:55.542]  It's almost better for you not to follow a handbook, because then the enemy can attack a handbook.
[00:45:55.902 --> 00:46:01.646]  If our attack profile on the info war is a unified, direct, it needs to be truly organic, truly real, but I appreciate your call.
[00:46:01.666 --> 00:46:03.427]  Let me explain what's happening with the polls.
[00:46:05.168 --> 00:46:07.710]  This is why the globalists love engineered crises.
[00:46:08.749 --> 00:46:10.049]  Fidel Castro is bad.
[00:46:10.449 --> 00:46:11.770]  Clearly he's a thug, a tyrant.
[00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:22.912]  So what they do is, they get the right-wing Cubans to murder, steal, deal drugs, commit assassinations, do anything, because it's for a good cause, fighting that communist.
[00:46:23.812 --> 00:46:25.733]  But then they turn into what they're fighting, or worse.
[00:46:27.173 --> 00:46:28.813]  And it's the same thing with the Poles.
[00:46:28.874 --> 00:46:33.214]  They had the communists attacking them, butchering them, slaughtering them, killing their families.
[00:46:33.555 --> 00:46:34.775]  They fought back, they win.
[00:46:35.731 --> 00:46:36.291]  They won.
[00:46:36.551 --> 00:46:39.212]  They see the Americans as the good guys who helped them.
[00:46:40.873 --> 00:46:45.435]  And so now they can't imagine 20, 30 years later that the United States is bad.
[00:46:45.455 --> 00:46:51.938]  They don't understand there's a group above Russia and the United States that was playing out a master chess game on record.
[00:46:51.958 --> 00:46:52.798]  This is all admitted.
[00:46:52.818 --> 00:46:54.239]  So I'll explain that when we get back.
[00:46:58.772 --> 00:47:00.974]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.
[00:47:01.134 --> 00:47:10.242]  We have received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes, and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[00:47:10.643 --> 00:47:18.490]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line with American Tax Settlement.
[00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:24.595]  For all Alex Jones listeners to see if you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands, the number to call is 1-800.
[00:47:25.456 --> 00:47:25.856]  We're good.
[00:47:42.802 --> 00:47:46.646]  Keeping the IRS off your back and saving consumers millions of dollars.
[00:47:47.026 --> 00:47:51.010]  If you owe $10,000 or more in taxes to the IRS, the number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.230]  That's 1-800-506-5904.
[00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:51.490]  Call today.
[00:47:59.312 --> 00:48:04.637]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:48:05.357 --> 00:48:10.682]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:48:11.242 --> 00:48:14.245]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[00:48:14.505 --> 00:48:17.426]  that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:48:17.727 --> 00:48:19.547]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:48:19.688 --> 00:48:22.069]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:48:22.149 --> 00:48:33.114]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:48:35.335 --> 00:48:36.636]  It's not about left or right.
[00:48:37.016 --> 00:48:38.397]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:48:38.877 --> 00:48:43.219]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told,
[00:48:43.866 --> 00:48:45.206]  And his real agenda.
[00:48:45.767 --> 00:48:53.549]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:48:54.029 --> 00:48:55.189]  The Obama Deception.
[00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:56.870]  The people strike back.
[00:48:59.471 --> 00:49:01.451]  Hi, I'm John Swenson at Midas Resources.
[00:49:01.471 --> 00:49:01.911]  800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:49:01.991 --> 00:49:03.332]  And let's take in a brief mind movie.
[00:49:07.739 --> 00:49:13.202]  We're surrounded by jesters, members of the nation's largest clown club based in Washington, D.C.
[00:49:13.422 --> 00:49:19.045]  Fuzzy hair, baggy pants, big yellow shoes, and now offering financial assurances that all will be well.
[00:49:19.225 --> 00:49:20.886]  The stimulus package is working.
[00:49:21.227 --> 00:49:22.768]  A bailout is coming your way.
[00:49:23.108 --> 00:49:27.030]  And while we're flat broke, we're also told that we've stepped back away from the brink.
[00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:27.690]  Pardon me?
[00:49:28.471 --> 00:49:29.431]  Back to the real world.
[00:49:29.711 --> 00:49:33.654]  We know that we can rely on no one but ourselves to generate financial security.
[00:49:33.974 --> 00:49:35.935]  Protecting your assets is solely up to you.
[00:49:36.522 --> 00:49:37.982]  No one else is coming to the rescue.
[00:49:38.222 --> 00:49:48.985]  Please call me, John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, to discuss investing in precious metals, gold and silver, with a 6,000 year track record of success and security.

[00:49:58.927 --> 00:50:03.908]  You've probably heard about the incredible, powerful and natural antioxidants found in red wine.
[00:50:04.246 --> 00:50:08.349]  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to drink a glass of wine each day.
[00:50:08.729 --> 00:50:12.871]  Now, you don't have to drink even a single drop, thanks to NuRev.
[00:50:13.152 --> 00:50:19.135]  NuRev is America's number one anti-aging supplement, thanks to its active ingredient, resveratrol.

[00:50:53.923 --> 00:50:55.885]  NewRevOnline.com.
[00:50:56.165 --> 00:50:57.707]  Improve your life today.
[00:51:30.529 --> 00:51:34.211]  So they selectively show you a young woman gunned down.
[00:51:34.891 --> 00:51:37.852]  Now the American people say, bomb Iran!
[00:51:37.972 --> 00:51:38.952]  Kill them all!
[00:51:39.753 --> 00:51:41.333]  Blow up buildings full of women!
[00:51:41.393 --> 00:51:42.734]  Just don't show them to us!
[00:51:44.804 --> 00:51:48.705]  It's very, very sick, selective propaganda, and it's all staged.
[00:51:49.385 --> 00:51:57.548]  And now I want to go ahead and start getting into North Korea situation, and then back to your phone calls, and a ton of other news.
[00:52:00.809 --> 00:52:03.009]  So let's go ahead and get into Korea.
[00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:14.253]  Notice how all of a sudden, Obama comes in, starts trying to pass his gun ban bills, secret list for Americans, all protests is terrorism.
[00:52:15.742 --> 00:52:16.903]  We'll be covering that coming up.
[00:52:21.845 --> 00:52:26.447]  The bankers are openly stealing $14.8 trillion here alone and growing and counting.
[00:52:28.108 --> 00:52:30.729]  And Europe's setting up a dictatorship of foreign offshore banks.
[00:52:32.313 --> 00:53:01.025]  All of this is happening, and meanwhile, suddenly, right when Kim Jong-il is sick and dying of cancer and says he may only have a few months left, his twenty-something-year-old son's about to be given power, right when the regime is in flux, there's a power transfer, all the sanctions in North Korea make millions more of their own people die, that's propping up that regime by the outside oppression, props up the inside oppression, the two tyrannies prop each other up,
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:06.521]  It's all this dark logic, this dark mathematics of the New World Order works.
[00:53:06.961 --> 00:53:07.681]  They brag about it.
[00:53:10.301 --> 00:53:21.883]  On top of that, the United States, ABB, Swiss Company, Donald Rumsfeld, Chairman of the Board, in the 90s, on record, mainstream news, it's in my film, The Masters of Terror.
[00:53:22.443 --> 00:53:27.544]  We talk about why did they give nukes to Pakistan and North Korea?
[00:53:27.564 --> 00:53:31.805]  Because later they're going to start wars with them as a way to encircle Russia and China and start a war with them.
[00:53:33.615 --> 00:53:36.137]  That's a film I made in 2002 and now it's happening.
[00:53:36.777 --> 00:53:40.539]  I mean, you know, these people are playing 10, 20, 30 year plans.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.440]  And they write books about it, bragging.
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:43.361]  This is not my opinion.
[00:53:45.082 --> 00:53:55.048]  The National Security Advisor for Obama, as Baby Brzezinski's bragged in two books he's written on the subject, one on the Grand Chess Board.
[00:53:56.429 --> 00:53:58.390]  So here it is, North Korea threatens to harm U.S.
[00:53:58.450 --> 00:53:58.871]  of attack.
[00:53:59.451 --> 00:54:00.772]  And they're saying they're going to start pulling over
[00:54:02.242 --> 00:54:07.844]  Any North Korean ships coming out of the country selling any components to any nation for food, for oil, for money.
[00:54:08.584 --> 00:54:10.205]  Heating oil, grain, things like that.
[00:54:10.765 --> 00:54:12.286]  And North Korea's saying that's an act of war.
[00:54:12.986 --> 00:54:20.709]  And if you do that, we're going to fire a nuke at South Korea, at Hawaii, or at Japan, and they got Taepung Dong-2 missiles.
[00:54:23.424 --> 00:54:27.147]  Kim Jong-il's dad, the first dictator, he died on July 4th.
[00:54:27.187 --> 00:54:28.728]  They always test missiles on July 4th.
[00:54:28.748 --> 00:54:32.110]  There are media saying they want to attack America on July 4th.
[00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:34.432]  That is not what these lunatics are doing.
[00:54:34.472 --> 00:54:45.119]  It's a cult all about the great leader, like he's a superhero, like they're now doing for Obama, or Hitler, Stalin, Iron Stalin, Steel Stalin.
[00:54:45.819 --> 00:54:48.181]  That's what Stalin means is steel, the man of steel.
[00:54:48.721 --> 00:54:51.023]  So they love the same crud.
[00:54:52.304 --> 00:54:54.785]  So they take anything North Korea does and also exaggerate it.
[00:54:54.845 --> 00:55:05.890]  They go, we're going to fire a missile, test missile into the Pacific, testing our range, and they say, oh, they're going to attack us on July 4th.
[00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:07.251]  So they also distort everything.
[00:55:07.551 --> 00:55:09.572]  But North Korea is officially coming out
[00:55:11.055 --> 00:55:19.277]  I've even tuned into their English transmission on the internet to check it for myself, and boy, let me tell you, listening to North Korean radio is not fun, that they are threatening to nuke South Korea.
[00:55:19.297 --> 00:55:31.860]  They say, if you attack us, we'll attack you, and they're having all these drills the last few months in the build-up to this, massing troops on the North Korean border with South Korea and submarines and missile cruisers menacing North Korea.
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:38.522]  So they're trying to push the lunatics into firing and doing some provocation so we can be off to the races.
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:46.643]  As of a month ago, the armistice, the ceasefire, 50-plus years old, is over.
[00:55:46.683 --> 00:55:47.683]  The state of war is back.
[00:55:48.984 --> 00:55:50.124]  North Korea reminded the U.S.
[00:55:50.164 --> 00:55:54.366]  on Monday that it has nuclear weapons and warned it will strike back if attacked as the U.S.
[00:55:54.386 --> 00:55:58.588]  destroyer continued to trail a North Korean cargo ship suspected of carrying illicit weapons.
[00:55:59.568 --> 00:56:02.729]  After the U.S., that is the people that run our country.
[00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:07.972]  The United States is a hooker being dragged by the hair by the pimp.
[00:56:08.757 --> 00:56:10.778]  So, I don't want to say the United States.
[00:56:10.878 --> 00:56:14.361]  The people dragging us, the hooker, around by our hair.
[00:56:14.881 --> 00:56:15.701]  That's the New World Order.
[00:56:15.721 --> 00:56:20.264]  So the New World Order is menacing and manipulating and armed North Korea to begin with.
[00:56:21.665 --> 00:56:26.608]  So I'll come back and finish up with this and then... I'm going to give each story one minute.
[00:56:26.628 --> 00:56:27.529]  I'm going to blitz through news.
[00:56:27.569 --> 00:56:29.310]  I'm just going to make myself... You guys time it.
[00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:30.831]  Make me stop each minute on each story.
[00:56:30.851 --> 00:56:32.672]  Because I just want to elaborate, elaborate.
[00:56:33.232 --> 00:56:37.115]  Like earlier how they announced Obama's volunteers, which will be forced volunteers,
[00:56:38.541 --> 00:56:39.201]  That's what it's called?
[00:56:39.561 --> 00:56:41.983]  Well, we'll be watching you on the surveillance cameras.
[00:56:42.003 --> 00:56:44.984]  That's their job, is watching communities and their felons.
[00:56:45.744 --> 00:56:47.045]  The New York Times says that's good, though.
[00:56:47.065 --> 00:56:49.246]  You're not against giving a felon a job, a second chance.
[00:56:49.266 --> 00:56:50.126]  We're on the march.
[00:56:50.606 --> 00:56:52.207]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:56:53.128 --> 00:56:55.809]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:58.578 --> 00:56:59.679]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:56:59.959 --> 00:57:01.740]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:02.581]  Well, you should.
[00:57:02.921 --> 00:57:07.163]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:57:07.424 --> 00:57:07.904]  That's right.

[00:57:23.874 --> 00:57:32.096]  In the caliber of your choice, I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:57:32.456 --> 00:57:37.657]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[00:58:05.333 --> 00:58:08.095]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:58:08.296 --> 00:58:11.158]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:58:11.359 --> 00:58:16.063]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:58:16.283 --> 00:58:17.224]  If you simply prepare.
[00:58:17.404 --> 00:58:20.327]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:58:20.647 --> 00:58:27.553]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:38.487]  The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still But nobody wants to know him They can see that he's just a fool And he never gives an answer But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round
[01:00:40.452 --> 01:00:42.097]  Alright, finishing up with North Korea.
[01:00:44.229 --> 01:00:46.290]  The RAND Corporation is declassified.
[01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:47.330]  I've got it in my films.
[01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:50.231]  We've linked to it at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:50.771 --> 01:01:02.695]  The Club of Rome, the United Nations, the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, which their official founding documents from 90-something years ago say we want to stage wars to bring in world government to stop wars.
[01:01:03.155 --> 01:01:10.458]  And then the Nazis wanted a European Union, and then they merged with the US and the British after the war in a deal to fight the Russians.
[01:01:11.658 --> 01:01:13.900]  And this is now mainstream European news.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:18.845]  We reported this years ago in my films like Martial Law and then Endgame.
[01:01:19.365 --> 01:01:20.466]  Martial Law five years ago.
[01:01:21.067 --> 01:01:22.067]  Hard to believe that's five years ago.
[01:01:22.087 --> 01:01:22.868]  Seems like yesterday.
[01:01:23.188 --> 01:01:24.430]  But now it's mainstream news.
[01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:26.171]  We have the documents, but now it's mainstream news.
[01:01:27.252 --> 01:01:28.914]  Just Google Nazis planned EU.
[01:01:29.254 --> 01:01:31.256]  They would say it's to stop another war.
[01:01:31.316 --> 01:01:32.317]  We've got to have a tyranny.
[01:01:33.604 --> 01:01:39.668]  And so they bragged that they would get a League of Nations and a World War I. That didn't work good, so they had World War II for the UN.
[01:01:39.708 --> 01:01:42.510]  The US set that up at Presidio in San Francisco.
[01:01:42.831 --> 01:01:47.534]  So they're always criticizing the UN on our news, like the US doesn't like it.
[01:01:47.554 --> 01:01:50.576]  The US funds 60% of it, owns and runs the whole thing.
[01:01:50.596 --> 01:01:53.018]  When I say US, Anglo-American British Empire.
[01:01:53.038 --> 01:01:58.862]  Because when I talk about Anglo-American British Empire, notice the Iranians are saying that.
[01:01:58.922 --> 01:02:00.283]  Notice the Russians are saying that.
[01:02:02.045 --> 01:02:03.186]  The Japanese are saying that.
[01:02:03.246 --> 01:02:04.726]  That's the terms worldwide.
[01:02:04.966 --> 01:02:13.370]  The terms I use here are used by anybody out there who's informed, or in the diplomatic corps, or historians, or people that study geopolitical systems.
[01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:15.671]  This is all just 101, I'm saying.
[01:02:15.711 --> 01:02:17.812]  It's not some, gosh, that Alex is smart.
[01:02:19.893 --> 01:02:21.654]  I want to be clear, this is not rocket science.
[01:02:21.694 --> 01:02:26.176]  This is all public, but not popularly known.
[01:02:27.742 --> 01:02:41.788]  Just like it's absolute fact in any mainline textbook on precious stones, or any textbook on industrial minerals, that diamonds are barely semi-precious.
[01:02:42.688 --> 01:02:55.774]  You've got the scale of super-precious, precious, semi-precious, down to stones at barely rate of semi-precious, and then non-precious stones, like non-polished granite or agate or something like that.
[01:02:56.601 --> 01:02:59.484]  They're barely even semi-precious.
[01:02:59.964 --> 01:03:01.445]  But no one knows that.
[01:03:02.566 --> 01:03:05.389]  Because they're geographically limited to just a few places.
[01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:09.572]  One spot in Canada, Arkansas, notice those are environmental preserves.
[01:03:09.592 --> 01:03:10.533]  The government won't let you have it.
[01:03:10.893 --> 01:03:13.355]  It's a De Beers-Oppenheimer monopoly.
[01:03:14.176 --> 01:03:17.419]  Notice there are diamonds in Australia.
[01:03:17.439 --> 01:03:18.760]  Those are government preserves.
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:20.181]  We're only select corporations.
[01:03:20.221 --> 01:03:20.902]  And then in Africa.
[01:03:21.362 --> 01:03:24.185]  And anybody that tries to dig a diamond without paying the globalists gets killed.
[01:03:25.316 --> 01:03:29.460]  And they make movies about blood diamonds acting like people trying to smuggle diamonds out of the bad guys.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.822]  We've got to have a world government to stop them.
[01:03:32.122 --> 01:03:33.524]  See, I mean, that's how all this works.
[01:03:33.844 --> 01:03:42.893]  They'll show you slave camp movies with Leonardo DiCaprio and go, oh man, we've got to shut down these slave camps, when it's the rich bankers running the slave camps publicly.
[01:03:43.723 --> 01:03:48.405]  And killing anybody that... But see, I said I get into news in North Korea and I'm off in diamonds.
[01:03:49.026 --> 01:03:51.387]  The point is, everything you've been taught is a lie.
[01:03:51.987 --> 01:03:56.949]  Everything that's reality is publicly available, it's just not on the news generally.
[01:03:59.611 --> 01:04:02.752]  So, North Korea threatens to harm U.S.
[01:04:02.812 --> 01:04:08.415]  if attacked and the United States says they're going to stop the ship any day now and we'll see if North Korea fires a nuke.
[01:04:11.155 --> 01:04:15.436]  And then you can say, well, they don't need to be shipping artillery to some terrorist group.
[01:04:17.017 --> 01:04:18.697]  But who gave them the nukes?
[01:04:19.097 --> 01:04:20.558]  Who gave Pakistan the nukes?
[01:04:20.878 --> 01:04:30.841]  It's like a month ago when they had the Pakistani President on TV, CIA already killed his wife, who was the President, Budo, and our media thought we were so dumb, they said she hit her head on the car.
[01:04:31.441 --> 01:04:35.302]  Then it turned out there's video of them shooting her, boom, boom, boom, from about 20 feet away.
[01:04:37.093 --> 01:04:38.874]  Flies up against the car with bullet holes in her.
[01:04:39.214 --> 01:04:41.495]  Our news goes, see, a young lady hit her head there.
[01:04:41.895 --> 01:04:43.555]  She slipped on a banana peel over there.
[01:04:43.976 --> 01:04:45.316]  They think we're so dumb!
[01:04:45.716 --> 01:04:48.437]  All over the world it's admitted that machine gunner in the U.S.
[01:04:48.457 --> 01:04:48.737]  did it.
[01:04:49.458 --> 01:04:51.538]  And then here they tell you she slipped on a banana peel.
[01:04:51.899 --> 01:04:54.360]  Because everybody knows the American people don't kill anybody.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.962]  And then, they've got the Taliban and Al-Qaeda attacking, attacking, attacking, trying to overthrow the Pakistani government.
[01:05:01.382 --> 01:05:02.983]  And that's the excuse to send in U.S.
[01:05:03.023 --> 01:05:03.363]  troops.
[01:05:05.754 --> 01:05:09.157]  So they can destabilize the nation further and break it in three to six parts.
[01:05:09.978 --> 01:05:12.800]  And they got the president on NBC going, why are you funding Al-Qaeda?
[01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:15.562]  And he laughs and says, what's wrong with you people?
[01:05:15.582 --> 01:05:18.164]  Everybody in the world knows you founded Al-Qaeda and Taliban.
[01:05:18.204 --> 01:05:20.406]  You have them attacking us to destabilize us.
[01:05:21.387 --> 01:05:27.852]  And the NBC CIA op just goes, because see, people just aren't playing along with the lies anymore.
[01:05:27.932 --> 01:05:29.113]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:05:29.854 --> 01:05:30.835]  It's ridiculous.
[01:05:31.983 --> 01:05:38.028]  And a lot of good old boys were like, yeah, the CIA's got to stage the terror attacks to keep the American way going.
[01:05:38.048 --> 01:05:40.630]  I've had a few of them, you know, kind of get in my face and do that.
[01:05:41.851 --> 01:05:43.973]  You know what happens if we don't stage 9-11, Alex?
[01:05:44.753 --> 01:05:46.595]  Then the Arabs take over the planet.
[01:05:47.476 --> 01:05:48.056]  They're dangerous.
[01:05:48.076 --> 01:05:49.797]  There are real Muslim extremists in our country.
[01:05:49.817 --> 01:05:50.578]  It's a bunch of wimps.
[01:05:50.938 --> 01:05:53.620]  And they had to be gotten in line to understand the threat.
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:58.403]  Oh, is that why you always overthrow countries and put the radical Muslims in power?
[01:05:58.624 --> 01:06:02.427]  Because you don't want secular first world nations that could compete with your power?
[01:06:03.228 --> 01:06:03.848]  Whatever!
[01:06:03.868 --> 01:06:05.209]  The world's a tough place!
[01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:07.391]  You gotta be tough to beat the evil!
[01:06:07.632 --> 01:06:13.617]  Yeah, you gotta become the evil to fight the evil.
[01:06:15.768 --> 01:06:31.264]  Until I was going fishing with some buddies down where their boat is, and it was down where there's a bunch of yachts on Lake Travis, and that's where one of these guys in the restaurant where we're eating hamburgers walks over, and later I saw him getting on probably one of the biggest yachts on Lake Travis, probably a three million dollar nothing big boat, and he just walked over and told me that.
[01:06:34.289 --> 01:06:35.870]  I recognize him off TV from somewhere.
[01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:38.251]  I didn't get his card, but he was just there telling me.
[01:06:38.711 --> 01:06:39.272]  You know what?
[01:06:39.712 --> 01:06:41.353]  We did that because we needed to.
[01:06:41.653 --> 01:06:42.213]  You know what I mean?
[01:06:42.253 --> 01:06:45.515]  These guys are just, you know, they sit around drinking their whiskey.
[01:06:45.555 --> 01:06:46.055]  Yeah!
[01:06:46.236 --> 01:06:50.238]  Gotta break a few eggs around here, lazy Americans.
[01:06:50.438 --> 01:06:52.279]  They need to learn how to fight them Arabs.
[01:06:52.699 --> 01:06:54.220]  It's not about fighting Arabs.
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.861]  It's so you can steal money and do whatever you want.
[01:06:57.150 --> 01:07:00.573]  You big fat cats that are having the feds federalize all the water to take over.
[01:07:01.053 --> 01:07:03.996]  It's all you guys that are raping everybody financially.
[01:07:04.036 --> 01:07:05.036]  You're a bunch of scum!
[01:07:05.317 --> 01:07:07.378]  Just stop saying you're pro-America!
[01:07:07.398 --> 01:07:11.562]  I mean, it's sick enough what you do.
[01:07:14.284 --> 01:07:17.687]  It's sick enough what you do.
[01:07:19.729 --> 01:07:21.950]  But then to say you did it for America.
[01:07:22.691 --> 01:07:24.913]  I mean, that's really disgusting.
[01:07:25.745 --> 01:07:27.407]  You put fluoride in our water for America?
[01:07:27.948 --> 01:07:30.851]  You shoot our kids up with cancer-filled injections?
[01:07:30.871 --> 01:07:32.614]  Because you love America?
[01:07:32.734 --> 01:07:34.576]  Look, I said I'd news blitz and I'm out of control.
[01:07:34.596 --> 01:07:41.285]  Alright, here it goes.
[01:07:41.325 --> 01:07:42.086]  I'm just going to cover news.
[01:07:43.695 --> 01:07:45.877]  A lot of this already hit, but just the stacks are all here.
[01:07:46.778 --> 01:07:50.001]  This is the stuff you never hear, and so I'm just going to read through it.
[01:07:50.261 --> 01:07:51.462]  Some of it I've covered, most of it I hadn't.
[01:07:52.103 --> 01:07:54.385]  On terrorist watch lists, but allowed to buy guns.
[01:07:54.405 --> 01:07:59.610]  That's the New York Times saying, ban everybody being able to buy guns without judge or jury, whenever the government feels like it.
[01:08:01.933 --> 01:08:05.935]  DOD training manual describes protest as low-level terrorism.
[01:08:06.455 --> 01:08:10.696]  Steve Watson, Infowars.net, links to AP, ACLU.
[01:08:12.117 --> 01:08:14.778]  It says anybody protesting, it's illegal, it's terrorism.
[01:08:16.519 --> 01:08:20.720]  Virginia State police say anti-new world order and gun rights activists are terrorists.
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:25.642]  They say protesting for pro-second amendment, you are a terrorist, go ahead and take them in, says they're dangerous.
[01:08:27.063 --> 01:08:27.483]  There's another one.
[01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:30.664]  Virginia State police designate anti-new world order opinion as domestic terrorism.
[01:08:31.769 --> 01:08:35.452]  BBC is... These will all be out of order, but there's no way to go through it all.
[01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:39.155]  BBC is backing election riots, claims Iran.
[01:08:39.875 --> 01:08:43.398]  And then did you guys ever print for me where BBC admits they staged fake photos?
[01:08:44.699 --> 01:08:46.540]  Throw that up on screen for folks, show them the fake photos.
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.842]  Let's just admit it, BBC... Oh, it was a mistake!
[01:08:51.364 --> 01:08:54.627]  Actually, those people that were shot were shot by the CIA.
[01:08:55.147 --> 01:08:58.049]  Oh, we're sorry, that was actually augmented energy supporters, we said with the other guys.
[01:08:58.830 --> 01:09:01.312]  BBC is backing election riots, claims Iran.
[01:09:02.697 --> 01:09:08.247]  Iran continues hostility towards Western media, threatening harsher actions if interference in countries affairs continues.
[01:09:08.547 --> 01:09:11.853]  They've launched their fighter jets, they've got their ships patrolling ready for war.
[01:09:12.734 --> 01:09:14.137]  The West is saying they're getting ready to hit.
[01:09:18.547 --> 01:09:21.288]  Protesters gather in Iran's capital despite stern warning.
[01:09:21.308 --> 01:09:23.369]  And again, they legitimately are dupes.
[01:09:24.150 --> 01:09:36.255]  Just like the Muslims that attacked Mohammad Mosaddegh when the CIA blew up their mosque and said the government had done it, and that Mosaddegh was going after the Muslims because he was trying to keep them from taking over society, the radical ones, the CIA-funded ones.
[01:09:36.275 --> 01:09:37.236]  They had been Hitler-funded.
[01:09:37.956 --> 01:09:45.499]  And so they used the Muslims to overthrow him that time, and now they're going to use the young punk rock youth to overthrow the mullahs.
[01:09:45.699 --> 01:09:46.660]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:09:47.830 --> 01:09:50.473]  Protesters gather in Iran's capital despite stern warning.
[01:09:53.737 --> 01:09:56.380]  Now, you're not hearing a lot about this, because every day this is happening.
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:10:05.471]  London Telegraph, tens of thousands of Chinese fight the police in Shish... Shish... Ho... I'm pronouncing that right.
[01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:17.724]  And it says after the police running the drugs in the town have been murdering a bunch of people that expose government drug dealing and how government party members own all the hotels and businesses and everybody's sick of them ruling.
[01:10:18.644 --> 01:10:22.646]  It says tens of thousands took to the streets attacking police.
[01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:25.147]  Just total hysteria.
[01:10:25.627 --> 01:10:30.889]  It was a dramatic weekend in a relatively small city of Xishou in Hubei province.
[01:10:31.229 --> 01:10:40.133]  Tens of thousands of rioters torched a hotel and overturned police cars after the authorities allegedly tried to cover up the murder of a 24-year-old man and other dead bodies.
[01:10:40.253 --> 01:10:42.014]  So they're not telling you about that.
[01:10:43.314 --> 01:10:44.995]  I mean, it's barely a blurb.
[01:10:45.015 --> 01:10:46.976]  The cops are shooting people but still getting defeated.
[01:10:46.996 --> 01:10:49.797]  I mean, China's on the verge of collapsing because of their corruption.
[01:10:50.657 --> 01:10:51.978]  And people are sick of the mullahs.
[01:10:53.117 --> 01:11:04.265]  Clearly, in Iran, they end up owning the state-run things and making money, and they're all getting filthy rich, and their kids are decking it, and the mullahs' kids beat people up and stuff, and, you know, just classic stuff.
[01:11:05.326 --> 01:11:11.590]  I mean, in the U.S., you talk bad about Bush's daughters, you get mailed anthrax, so, you know, it's the same thing everywhere.
[01:11:11.610 --> 01:11:13.832]  It's like messing with, you know, Hitler's cousin or something.
[01:11:13.852 --> 01:11:14.893]  You're going to end up in big trouble.
[01:11:17.094 --> 01:11:17.995]  That's how this works.
[01:11:18.115 --> 01:11:22.138]  I mean, you know, it's like all these boss hog cops whose kids can do whatever they want in small towns.
[01:11:23.356 --> 01:11:29.859]  And then, you know, they can go up and beat you up if they want, and then you end up finally fighting back with the Boss Hog's kid, and then Boss Hog has you killed.
[01:11:30.139 --> 01:11:31.240]  That's how it works in Texas.
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:33.521]  In Arkansas and everywhere else.
[01:11:33.561 --> 01:11:34.701]  In Louisiana and Mississippi.
[01:11:36.942 --> 01:11:38.303]  So, uh, it's the same everywhere.
[01:11:38.323 --> 01:11:38.863]  It's just tyranny.
[01:11:38.883 --> 01:11:39.544]  It's just government.
[01:11:39.604 --> 01:11:40.204]  It's just thieves.
[01:11:40.244 --> 01:11:40.944]  Thieves in government.
[01:11:41.865 --> 01:11:44.626]  Kentucky hate crime report mentions Constitution Party.
[01:11:46.004 --> 01:11:48.606]  And again, we have Missouri TV, Kentucky TV.
[01:11:48.906 --> 01:11:53.129]  Let's go ahead and play that clip right now, just a few minutes of it, off Missouri TV.
[01:11:53.889 --> 01:11:59.793]  And notice how they make us apologize, Constitution Party people.
[01:11:59.813 --> 01:12:04.956]  And I supported the Constitution Party after Ron Paul dropped out because he was losing, after he lost the nomination.
[01:12:05.957 --> 01:12:13.082]  Chuck Baldwin, audit the Federal Reserve, get us out of the UN, no taxation without representation, property rights.
[01:12:15.247 --> 01:12:16.768]  You know, founding father type stuff.
[01:12:17.388 --> 01:12:18.849]  And they say in there, you're a terrorist.
[01:12:18.909 --> 01:12:21.451]  And they got the ADL on tape saying, yeah, these are dangerous people.
[01:12:22.932 --> 01:12:25.293]  And then the Constitution Party like going, we're not bad.
[01:12:25.973 --> 01:12:34.819]  Why aren't we blaming a government that starts demonizing groups and starts saying, we're going to ban your guns without an arrest or a warrant or without telling you why you can't own guns?
[01:12:35.499 --> 01:12:38.341]  Or if you've got bad credit, you'll be on a no-fly, no-buy list.
[01:12:38.401 --> 01:12:40.322]  I mean, this is total tyranny.
[01:12:40.862 --> 01:12:43.784]  Why isn't it about how the ADL's been caught
[01:12:45.049 --> 01:12:48.251]  Breaking into the apartments of anti-apartheid protesters.
[01:12:48.631 --> 01:12:53.874]  They work with the South Africans and race-specific bioweapons and spying on the American people illegally and being a Mossad front.
[01:12:54.154 --> 01:12:56.475]  Or why don't they talk about, you know, stuff like that?
[01:12:56.555 --> 01:13:04.419]  No, it's all about persecuting the American people and demonizing us saying no to the Federal Reserve takeover.
[01:13:04.659 --> 01:13:05.019]  Here it is.
[01:13:05.039 --> 01:13:09.802]  And then we're going to get into something else.
[01:13:11.222 --> 01:13:11.923]  Then we're going to get into
[01:13:14.765 --> 01:13:17.345]  It's Wednesday and that means tax protesters.
[01:13:17.751 --> 01:13:28.435]  An anti-tax demonstration is scheduled for downtown's Keener Plaza April 15th, but charges are flying that one of the organizing groups is an extremist anti-government group.
[01:13:28.455 --> 01:13:29.435]  Let's stop right there.
[01:13:30.136 --> 01:13:35.718]  How about I say you're an extreme anti-American lady, up there chilling effect, demonizing.
[01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:41.660]  Oh, there's a protest and she acts real stern like, ooh, a protest, ooh, is that legal?
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:44.421]  And then the army's being trained that it is illegal.
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:58.146]  And then, ooh, we're gonna see about this, you know, the Constitution Party, fast-growing, founded by a Jew, Aaron Russo, maybe he's anti-Semitic, oh, you know, that's the mindset here.
[01:14:00.006 --> 01:14:09.170]  This is so, so they have the little info babe up there, charges, and of course this is, did you guys find the old clip in Missouri where they say it's illegal to criticize Obama?
[01:14:09.190 --> 01:14:11.651]  Did you guys find that clip earlier when I wanted it?
[01:14:13.132 --> 01:14:14.993]  John, you have that in the computer in Minnesota, don't you?
[01:14:18.339 --> 01:14:22.701]  Yeah, yeah, where they say, saying Obama's bad is illegal and we'll arrest you.
[01:14:23.522 --> 01:14:27.064]  It's something like criticizing Obama illegal.
[01:14:27.104 --> 01:14:28.164]  Kurt Nimmo wrote a story about it.
[01:14:28.325 --> 01:14:29.865]  Whatever, the point is it's on record.
[01:14:30.226 --> 01:14:31.406]  Go ahead and play the rest of it.
[01:14:32.867 --> 01:14:38.790]  The charges are flying that one of the organizing groups is an extremist anti-government group.
[01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:41.312]  New on the Edge, Charles Jaco says... Hit pause again!
[01:14:42.557 --> 01:14:45.442]  Again, you're not allowed to criticize the government!
[01:14:45.983 --> 01:14:46.844]  That's criminal!
[01:14:47.185 --> 01:14:48.427]  Charges are flying!
[01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:54.998]  How about we're against foreign banks hijacking and ruling the nation as is being admitted now?
[01:14:56.305 --> 01:15:16.316]  I mean, think about how outrageous it is that I've got all these news articles where they're saying, restrict free speech, ban anybody criticizing the government, bills introduced where the federal government will decide whether you can have a website, or whether you can say something or not, no judge, no jury, Federal Reserve announcing they're taking everything over, and you say, hey, I want a Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:15:16.656 --> 01:15:17.757]  Oh, you're anti-government!
[01:15:18.584 --> 01:15:20.746]  And then, like, the people are on the defense of Apollo.
[01:15:20.946 --> 01:15:22.988]  Well, we're allowed to, you know, say what we want.
[01:15:23.048 --> 01:15:23.948]  I mean, it's just sick!
[01:15:24.008 --> 01:15:25.430]  It's so anti-American!
[01:15:25.770 --> 01:15:26.290]  Back to it.
[01:15:27.651 --> 01:15:33.236]  Well, Sandy, the group is the Constitution Party, and they've run candidates for, among other offices, mayor of St.
[01:15:33.256 --> 01:15:37.820]  Louis, congressional seats, and several statewide Missouri offices.
[01:15:38.581 --> 01:15:48.985]  The Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and at one point, the Missouri Highway Patrol, all labeled the Constitution Party an anti-government extremist organization.
[01:15:49.445 --> 01:15:55.347]  That upset members not only of the party, but at least one high-profile Missouri politician as well.
[01:15:57.008 --> 01:16:02.130]  In late February, protesters upset with the stimulus and bailout plans dumped tea into the Mississippi River.
[01:16:02.529 --> 01:16:08.457]  That protest, like the planned anti-tax demonstration, was sponsored by the Constitution Police.
[01:16:19.639 --> 01:16:23.082]  See, they're bad terrorists, but see, oh, the citizens dumping a little tea in the river.
[01:16:23.462 --> 01:16:26.324]  Oh my God, they're so scary, these families out there!
[01:16:26.845 --> 01:16:28.166]  Who want lower taxes?
[01:16:28.306 --> 01:16:29.407]  It's scary!
[01:16:29.427 --> 01:16:31.748]  Oh, we gotta ban them!
[01:16:32.069 --> 01:16:34.010]  Play the rest of this un-American crud.
[01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:37.012]  It's partly sponsored by the Constitution Party.
[01:16:37.313 --> 01:16:43.297]  I don't believe that the government needs to try to spend more money than they have in order to save the people.
[01:16:43.317 --> 01:16:44.018]  I think the people
[01:16:44.667 --> 01:16:45.968]  Or what would make this country great.
[01:16:46.028 --> 01:16:51.233]  But the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League have their own opinions about the Constitution Party.
[01:16:51.493 --> 01:16:54.216]  I think we'd consider it a... Hit pause!
[01:16:54.356 --> 01:16:57.199]  Look at that lady, this anti-American commissariat.
[01:16:57.839 --> 01:17:08.489]  ADL's calling for restricting web-free speech and Violent Radicalization Act, listing 9-11 truth groups as terrorists, and now magically they have a shooting to somewhat prove it all right on time.
[01:17:08.809 --> 01:17:10.391]  I mean, look at this commissar!
[01:17:10.771 --> 01:17:15.056]  Why don't you teleport back to 1925 Soviet Russia under Lenin, lady?
[01:17:15.256 --> 01:17:16.758]  Why don't you get out of our country?
[01:17:16.998 --> 01:17:18.120]  It's our First Amendment!
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:20.562]  Stop spying on the American people!
[01:17:21.183 --> 01:17:21.844]  Go back to her!
[01:17:21.904 --> 01:17:22.385]  Look at her!
[01:17:30.216 --> 01:17:31.317]  Uh, extremist roots.
[01:17:31.577 --> 01:17:34.459]  When we talk about the new world order, it is, um... Hit pause.
[01:17:34.759 --> 01:17:35.760]  Hey lady, it's over.
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:37.841]  Your master's already announced world government.
[01:17:38.142 --> 01:17:38.902]  It's all admitted.
[01:17:39.122 --> 01:17:40.723]  All these years you said it didn't exist.
[01:17:41.064 --> 01:17:41.724]  Jigs up!
[01:17:41.944 --> 01:17:43.846]  Everybody learned you're a big fat liar!
[01:17:45.347 --> 01:17:46.508]  You're not getting our guns.
[01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:47.788]  You're not getting our property.
[01:17:47.949 --> 01:17:49.169]  You're not gonna commissars.
[01:17:49.330 --> 01:17:50.871]  I know you got the instincts to do it.
[01:17:51.211 --> 01:17:54.013]  I know you think that you're gonna feast on American flesh.
[01:17:54.273 --> 01:17:55.334]  It ain't happening, witch.
[01:17:59.246 --> 01:18:00.507]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:00.547 --> 01:18:05.910]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:18:06.151 --> 01:18:10.774]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:18:11.174 --> 01:18:16.237]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:18:16.737 --> 01:18:21.440]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:18:21.961 --> 01:18:23.842]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:18:24.266 --> 01:18:28.870]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:29.971]  And here's the best part.
[01:18:30.191 --> 01:18:32.954]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:18:32.974 --> 01:18:36.557]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:18:36.877 --> 01:18:39.720]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:41.961]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:18:42.302 --> 01:18:43.223]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:18:43.243 --> 01:18:43.423]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:18:51.095 --> 01:18:55.599]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:18:55.919 --> 01:18:58.361]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:18:59.082 --> 01:19:00.423]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:19:00.603 --> 01:19:05.587]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[01:19:05.967 --> 01:19:08.049]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[01:19:08.389 --> 01:19:17.597]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout group.
[01:19:17.877 --> 01:19:24.623]  This program has already settled over 100 million dollars of debt and are saving individual consumers thousands of dollars.
[01:19:24.943 --> 01:19:31.088]  Folks, if you are struggling with credit card debt and those excessive interest payments, the time is now to take advantage of this opportunity.
[01:19:31.268 --> 01:19:32.949]  Call the bailout group today at 1-800-324-6554.
[01:19:36.172 --> 01:19:37.732]  I hope our listeners take advantage of this.

[01:19:43.574 --> 01:19:50.215]  Let the Bailout Group bail you out of debt, reduce your payments by up to 60%, and save you thousands of dollars today.
[01:19:50.455 --> 01:19:51.395]  That number again is 1-800-324-6554.
[01:19:51.415 --> 01:19:51.475]  800-324-6554.
[01:19:51.495 --> 01:19:51.976]  The Bailout Group.
[01:19:59.511 --> 01:20:01.372]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:20:01.492 --> 01:20:06.675]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:20:06.855 --> 01:20:08.196]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:20:08.456 --> 01:20:16.621]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:20:16.861 --> 01:20:22.585]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:20:22.765 --> 01:20:24.547]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:20:24.587 --> 01:20:26.749]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:20:26.769 --> 01:20:31.153]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:20:31.313 --> 01:20:33.435]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:20:33.535 --> 01:20:41.402]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:20:52.586 --> 01:20:54.207]  Heart and Body Extract, 866-295-5305.
[01:20:54.247 --> 01:20:55.428]  Or HBextract.com.
[01:20:55.448 --> 01:21:07.693]  Alright, I got a state senator coming on to talk about how they're robbing everybody in Texas.
[01:21:07.753 --> 01:21:10.914]  I have my folder in the garbage bin somewhere.
[01:21:12.924 --> 01:21:13.905]  Earlier I mentioned this.
[01:21:13.945 --> 01:21:14.585]  People don't believe me.
[01:21:14.605 --> 01:21:15.806]  Here's USA Today.
[01:21:15.826 --> 01:21:18.948]  Houston police chief wants cameras on home streets.
[01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:25.773]  And that's out of Associated Press and USA Today.
[01:21:26.414 --> 01:21:29.116]  And he said, I want cameras inside people's homes.
[01:21:32.038 --> 01:21:35.781]  And he said, I don't care if it's radical and extreme and may violate the Fourth Amendment protections.
[01:21:35.841 --> 01:21:39.844]  We want cameras in your homes, said the police chief of Houston.
[01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:42.069]  There it is, USA Today.
[01:21:42.089 --> 01:21:48.792]  And I was reading that because the LA Times reports they use all these forced volunteers to get out of high school or college.
[01:21:48.992 --> 01:21:53.153]  They're going to use them to federally watch surveillance cameras and watch the American people.
[01:21:53.593 --> 01:21:55.334]  This is an army of snitches and spies.
[01:21:55.354 --> 01:21:57.714]  I mean, this is right out of Stasi, Germany.
[01:21:57.754 --> 01:21:59.435]  This is right out of Nazi Germany, right out of...
[01:22:00.663 --> 01:22:02.424]  Look, here's the ADL.
[01:22:02.824 --> 01:22:06.507]  All they do is run around demonizing anybody that doesn't like the New World Order.
[01:22:07.047 --> 01:22:11.911]  And they've been convicted of crimes, repeatedly spying on people and breaking the law and infiltrating police departments.
[01:22:12.551 --> 01:22:13.572]  And that's all this is.
[01:22:14.052 --> 01:22:16.734]  And here's the ADL demonizing the Constitution Party.
[01:22:16.754 --> 01:22:18.695]  And the ADL wrote that MIAC report.
[01:22:19.055 --> 01:22:19.456]  Here it is.
[01:22:19.476 --> 01:22:23.478]  You guys roll that?
[01:22:23.598 --> 01:22:27.541]  Go ahead and roll it for me.
[01:22:27.561 --> 01:22:27.881]  Thank you.
[01:22:28.722 --> 01:22:30.383]  Opinions about the Constitution Party.
[01:22:30.683 --> 01:22:37.666]  I think we'd consider it a fringe right-wing political party that we consider to have extremist roots.
[01:22:37.926 --> 01:22:48.471]  When we talk about the New World Order, it is mimicking, if not duplicating, language that comes out of organized white supremacy.
[01:22:48.751 --> 01:22:53.273]  The Southern Poverty Law Center, in fact, calls the Constitution Party a Christian nationalist group.
[01:22:53.846 --> 01:22:57.509]  There is a certain belief of what we believe.
[01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:58.569]  That's enough.
[01:22:58.589 --> 01:22:59.070]  That's enough.
[01:22:59.090 --> 01:22:59.950]  Yeah, the evil founders.
[01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:06.314]  See, if white supremacists come out for ham sandwiches, and you eat ham sandwiches, you're a Nazi.
[01:23:07.675 --> 01:23:12.458]  Of course the white supremacists want to control our borders, and so do 80 plus percent of Americans in Gallup polls.
[01:23:12.959 --> 01:23:14.720]  It's actually 91 in one Gallup poll I saw.
[01:23:15.836 --> 01:23:23.899]  So, see, that'd be like saying, because Von Bruhn was a World War II vet, all World War II vets want to go to the Holocaust Center and shoot a guard in the face.
[01:23:23.919 --> 01:23:26.659]  I mean, it's just, it isn't going to work anymore.
[01:23:26.699 --> 01:23:29.100]  Everybody knows there's a world government being set up by the banks.
[01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:40.964]  The Federal Reserve openly, like I told you all last week, and that's why this is important, what you're about to see, you push this out in the mainstream, then Ron Paul talked about it, then Judge Napolitano,
[01:23:41.909 --> 01:23:47.453]  And then many others, and now it's admitted the Federal Reserve is setting up a total dictatorship over the entire country.
[01:23:48.453 --> 01:23:49.975]  We pushed that out in the open.
[01:23:50.235 --> 01:23:51.295]  You did that as the listeners.
[01:23:52.316 --> 01:23:56.039]  Now, the FBI, the Congress, the courts, are they above the law?
[01:23:56.119 --> 01:23:56.359]  No.
[01:23:56.479 --> 01:23:58.400]  Why is the private offshore Federal Reserve?
[01:24:00.362 --> 01:24:03.664]  And I'm not a white supremacist because I don't want to be ruled by offshore banks.
[01:24:05.785 --> 01:24:06.646]  Go ahead and play that.
[01:24:08.328 --> 01:24:17.193]  I'm Judge Andrew Napolitano and the verdict is coming on President Barack Obama's historic plan to overhaul and regulate our financial institutions.
[01:24:17.634 --> 01:24:18.474]  Here's the question.
[01:24:18.914 --> 01:24:24.978]  What is left out of this proposal is, and what we deserve to know is, who will regulate the Federal Reserve?
[01:24:25.458 --> 01:24:31.582]  What will become of clauses in the Constitution that prohibit the very type of regulation the President wants?
[01:24:32.182 --> 01:24:36.285]  And what is now the meaning of the word free in free market?
[01:24:37.381 --> 01:24:38.161]  Here are the facts.
[01:24:38.721 --> 01:24:42.782]  The bias of the drafters of this proposal is that the government knows best.
[01:24:43.342 --> 01:24:52.884]  The Constitution should not be an obstacle to the egalitarian goals of the government, and no private behavior is beyond the government's reach of its huge hand.
[01:24:53.464 --> 01:25:06.166]  The essence of the proposal is to give the Federal Reserve the authority to regulate any aspect of any firms that, in its discretion, its sole discretion, could adversely affect the economy if they fail.
[01:25:06.846 --> 01:25:12.550]  The Fed would thus be the only unregulated private entity on the planet.
[01:25:13.190 --> 01:25:14.591]  This private super... Ah, that's enough.
[01:25:14.671 --> 01:25:15.111]  Hit pause.
[01:25:15.972 --> 01:25:20.215]  I've got a state senator coming on with big news of highway robbery and the police.
[01:25:23.337 --> 01:25:24.738]  This is going on nationwide.
[01:25:25.498 --> 01:25:27.099]  But he's trying to pass a bill to stop it.
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:28.860]  Got it here somewhere in the stack.
[01:25:29.521 --> 01:25:30.882]  Gotta go mining in to get it.
[01:25:31.983 --> 01:25:34.344]  Then I'm gonna go back into all this and take your calls.
[01:25:34.404 --> 01:25:34.884]  Coming up.
[01:25:34.924 --> 01:25:35.365]  Stay with us.
[01:25:40.717 --> 01:25:42.817]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:25:43.318 --> 01:25:46.678]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:25:48.739 --> 01:25:54.280]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:55.740]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:59.861]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around called InnerFood.
[01:26:00.161 --> 01:26:08.323]  My wife just loves the stuff and now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[01:26:09.463 --> 01:26:12.024]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[01:26:12.324 --> 01:26:13.825]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[01:26:14.085 --> 01:26:16.846]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[01:26:17.086 --> 01:26:18.527]  And their formula really works.
[01:26:18.807 --> 01:26:21.348]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:26:21.608 --> 01:26:22.869]  Try the Nutri-Cafe.
[01:26:23.109 --> 01:26:27.531]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[01:26:27.871 --> 01:26:30.072]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:26:30.272 --> 01:26:32.553]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:26:32.753 --> 01:26:34.494]  Don't forget to try their other great products.

[01:27:08.473 --> 01:27:08.593]  Yeah.
[01:27:26.821 --> 01:27:53.375]  For many years I would tell people about local news stories that I've seen in Texas but in other parts of the country where the police pull you over and the stories that always tend to get the news attention is when
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:28:11.891]  It's an old lady, and I've seen the state police do this, a whole bunch of other towns in Texas have done it, where they'll pull an old lady over, and old ladies tend to carry a lot of cash around, they're old-fashioned, they're not stupid, like the modern people that go off the cashless society where the government controls everything, and they pull them over and they say, you got $4,000 cash, or Ron Paul...
[01:28:15.854 --> 01:28:24.501]  You know, treasurer for selling t-shirts at a big rally of 50,000 people has $4,000 and they go ahead and arrest him and try to steal the money.
[01:28:25.041 --> 01:28:36.509]  Famous cases I've seen on the news where one famous case was a guy from, what, South Carolina flying to Houston once a year to buy twenty-something thousand dollars worth of plants.
[01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:39.732]  And he would pay for it in cash to get a discount.
[01:28:42.362 --> 01:28:48.827]  And they saw his cash box and saw him pay with cash, and they just stole it and said, we don't care if you got receipts and you're buying plants.
[01:28:49.287 --> 01:28:50.728]  You just shouldn't have money, we're taking it.
[01:28:50.788 --> 01:28:52.250]  No judge, no jury, no nothing.
[01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:53.611]  And they're doing that now with the internet.
[01:28:53.631 --> 01:28:58.614]  They say, we're just going to shut Freedom down on the web, and we're going to just ban protests, forget even free speech zones.
[01:28:59.395 --> 01:29:00.456]  It's all being announced.
[01:29:02.176 --> 01:29:03.757]  In fact, guys, I keep looking in my stack.
[01:29:04.177 --> 01:29:09.140]  Steve Watson wrote a story about web censorship, and I thought I printed it, and I don't have it.
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:10.080]  It's on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:10.801]  Will you give me that?
[01:29:10.821 --> 01:29:11.941]  I want to cover that coming up later.
[01:29:12.882 --> 01:29:13.182]  Thanks.
[01:29:13.742 --> 01:29:16.804]  It's great having that team out there, because I can just get all the info.
[01:29:17.484 --> 01:29:19.025]  But I would talk about this.
[01:29:20.106 --> 01:29:23.508]  Louisiana and Mississippi are famous for this, too, where the cops steal from you.
[01:29:23.808 --> 01:29:24.749]  It's like Mexico.
[01:29:24.889 --> 01:29:27.170]  I've had the police pull me over in Mexico.
[01:29:28.010 --> 01:29:29.051]  I've seen it with my parents.
[01:29:32.011 --> 01:29:34.312]  They come over and they say, uh, I need you to pay a fine.
[01:29:35.313 --> 01:29:36.294]  Pay me cash right now.
[01:29:37.434 --> 01:29:44.899]  And if you don't pay them fifty bucks, a hundred bucks, they're gonna take you to jail, and they're gonna run a credit check on you, and they're gonna find out how much money you got, and it's gonna be fifty thousand.
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:51.983]  And if they can find a twenty-two round that you drove across the border that fell under your seat, ten years in prison, they're gonna take everything you got.
[01:29:52.804 --> 01:29:54.065]  And it's the same thing here.
[01:29:54.125 --> 01:29:55.886]  We're becoming like North Korea or Mexico.
[01:29:57.734 --> 01:30:03.860]  And I've talked a lot about this, but Texas Senator John Whitmire has introduced a bill to stop that, so he's scheduled to be coming up.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:06.723]  Texas police shakedown drivers, lawsuit claims.
[01:30:07.524 --> 01:30:14.851]  And then CNN goes and talks to the sheriffs and police and they go, yeah, we take people's money, they're not supposed to have it.
[01:30:16.144 --> 01:30:17.666]  No judge, no jury, no nothing.
[01:30:18.147 --> 01:30:21.791]  And then the cops keep it, and the judges actually get money from their own cases.
[01:30:21.831 --> 01:30:28.499]  They have cops on tape going, and judges in Texas, right outside Austin, one case last week, and they go, yeah, I keep the money for myself.
[01:30:29.561 --> 01:30:31.744]  You know, the judge rules and then keeps it.
[01:30:31.784 --> 01:30:33.305]  It's like, totally normal.
[01:30:35.318 --> 01:30:36.740]  CNN, do you want me to send a SWAT team?
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:37.741]  You guys are CIA.
[01:30:37.781 --> 01:30:38.702]  You're stealing everything too.
[01:30:38.722 --> 01:30:39.704]  I mean, what's the big deal here?
[01:30:40.485 --> 01:30:41.887]  Aren't we here to rape these smucks?
[01:30:42.067 --> 01:30:44.951]  I mean, this is the land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[01:30:45.572 --> 01:30:46.874]  These people love being slaves.
[01:30:46.894 --> 01:30:48.156]  These people love being controlled.
[01:30:49.889 --> 01:30:50.610]  What's the big deal?
[01:30:51.391 --> 01:30:53.032]  I mean, can't we get in on the raping too?
[01:30:53.773 --> 01:30:55.495]  So we're going to be talking about that coming up.
[01:30:55.535 --> 01:31:04.025]  The problem is, this needs to be handled by the state, like the Senator's doing, because the feds love reporting on bad local cops.
[01:31:04.325 --> 01:31:06.187]  So they can come in and federalize things and then...
[01:31:07.128 --> 01:31:08.851]  The lower feds don't get any of the booty.
[01:31:08.871 --> 01:31:10.013]  They just get a bigger paycheck.
[01:31:10.594 --> 01:31:11.575]  They don't get any of the spoils.
[01:31:11.916 --> 01:31:21.550]  They'll just come and take your farm or ranch, and mainstream state senators and the Cattlemen's Association, this is mainly to target Texas, because Texas has hardly any federal land.
[01:31:22.898 --> 01:31:24.179]  Text of S.

[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:32.984]  This says rainwater, wells, aquifers, creeks, pools of water, puddles.
[01:31:33.564 --> 01:31:34.424]  They can do anything.
[01:31:34.484 --> 01:31:35.185]  Take your land.
[01:31:35.245 --> 01:31:36.405]  No warrants come on.
[01:31:36.846 --> 01:31:39.247]  Total federal takeover of America with this.
[01:31:39.727 --> 01:31:42.069]  And then you got the Federal Reserve announcing they own the country.
[01:31:42.669 --> 01:31:45.370]  That's coming up with Judge Napolitano and a lot more.
[01:31:46.731 --> 01:31:49.033]  Look, they're going for broke on every level.
[01:31:49.434 --> 01:31:54.158]  Federal, international, corporate looting, tyranny, and the local cops running around robbing everybody.
[01:31:54.498 --> 01:31:57.561]  I mean, it's just total criminal, rogue government gone to sea.
[01:31:58.882 --> 01:32:03.886]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:32:04.086 --> 01:32:04.567]  Number one.
[01:32:04.887 --> 01:32:07.868]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.128 --> 01:32:08.348]  Number 2.
[01:32:08.809 --> 01:32:13.710]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.011 --> 01:32:14.471]  It's true.
[01:32:14.651 --> 01:32:18.872]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:19.092 --> 01:32:19.333]  Number 3.
[01:32:20.013 --> 01:32:25.455]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:32:25.615 --> 01:32:25.835]  Number 4.
[01:32:26.295 --> 01:32:28.956]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:32:29.196 --> 01:32:32.598]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:32.858 --> 01:32:33.058]  Number 5.
[01:32:33.698 --> 01:32:37.340]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:43.044]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:32:43.284 --> 01:32:47.847]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:47.987 --> 01:32:49.528]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:49.768 --> 01:32:52.089]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[01:33:01.795 --> 01:33:02.436]  Well, you should.
[01:33:02.776 --> 01:33:07.019]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:33:07.279 --> 01:33:07.759]  That's right.
[01:33:08.079 --> 01:33:17.906]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[01:33:18.086 --> 01:33:25.091]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:33:25.431 --> 01:33:31.955]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:33:32.316 --> 01:33:37.539]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:38.980]  This is real.
[01:33:39.301 --> 01:33:40.041]  Don't miss out.
[01:33:40.361 --> 01:33:47.226]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course, plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.

[01:33:59.398 --> 01:34:02.681]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:34:02.841 --> 01:34:06.924]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:34:07.105 --> 01:34:18.534]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:34:18.774 --> 01:34:24.599]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:34:24.839 --> 01:34:25.460]  We're good to go.
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:52.261]  Ladies and gentlemen, tens of thousands of phone calls were made to Governor Perry's office
[01:35:18.931 --> 01:35:21.113]  Against a bill that he was going to sign.
[01:35:24.256 --> 01:35:25.757]  State Senator's bill.
[01:35:26.818 --> 01:35:27.619]  Kirk Watson.
[01:35:27.639 --> 01:35:32.784]  1440 where the CPS could seize your kids without a warrant or even a court order.
[01:35:33.104 --> 01:35:35.947]  Thank God we just learned that was defeated.
[01:35:36.347 --> 01:35:40.191]  I was asking another state senator during the break as we were getting him on about another subject.
[01:35:41.211 --> 01:35:45.775]  And my guys googled it and found it in the news that this just happened today.
[01:35:46.176 --> 01:35:48.778]  So breaking here, this has been defeated.
[01:35:48.838 --> 01:35:50.139]  Thank God to your phone calls.
[01:35:50.499 --> 01:35:53.562]  Maybe if we call Governor Perry, we can stop the highway robbery.
[01:35:53.982 --> 01:35:59.426]  I've been hearing about this for a decade in the news, where the police will pull over old ladies, you name it.
[01:35:59.867 --> 01:36:01.308]  They usually make the news when it's an old lady.
[01:36:01.348 --> 01:36:04.370]  Nobody believes a white guy or a black guy, some young guy with tattoos.
[01:36:05.071 --> 01:36:10.216]  But old ladies, they'll just take $4,000, $5,000, $1,000, take their watch, say, what's your proof?
[01:36:10.236 --> 01:36:11.097]  This cash is yours.
[01:36:11.217 --> 01:36:13.660]  And then the judges keep the money personally.
[01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:18.765]  And finally, it's been on CNN and Fox and other channels, thanks to Senator John Whitmore.
[01:36:19.186 --> 01:36:23.810]  And I like his solution of having a state law on this forfeiture, where they can't keep it personally.
[01:36:24.691 --> 01:36:30.415]  So the feds don't come in and federalize things off of forfeiture laws they pioneered to begin with.
[01:36:31.376 --> 01:36:32.657]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:36:32.677 --> 01:36:39.221]  So state senator for Houston and surrounding areas, very important state senator here in Texas, Senator John Whitmore.
[01:36:39.482 --> 01:36:40.843]  Thank you for spending time with us, sir.
[01:36:41.123 --> 01:36:41.483]  That's fine.
[01:36:41.543 --> 01:36:42.063]  It's Whitmore.
[01:36:42.644 --> 01:36:44.485]  Whitmore, right?
[01:36:44.585 --> 01:36:45.346]  I'll answer anything.
[01:36:46.219 --> 01:36:46.859]  I know it's Whitmire.
[01:36:46.879 --> 01:36:47.740]  In fact, we've had you on before.
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:48.400]  I apologize.
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:49.961]  No problem, no problem.
[01:36:50.001 --> 01:36:51.701]  Yes, it's Senator John Whitmire.
[01:36:52.042 --> 01:36:52.902]  We've got a lot going on here.
[01:36:53.622 --> 01:36:59.244]  Sir, tell us about the bill and where it's going, what's happening, why we need to do something about this.
[01:37:00.385 --> 01:37:03.106]  Well, we started Family Forfeiture as a good program in about 1986.
[01:37:03.246 --> 01:37:09.188]  It was to keep criminals from benefiting from the profits of their crime.
[01:37:10.109 --> 01:37:14.230]  In other words, a drug runner ends up with a lot of cash or automobiles or planes.
[01:37:16.095 --> 01:37:16.675]  We're good to go.
[01:37:45.191 --> 01:37:46.972]  So we had a hearing on it last summer.
[01:37:47.933 --> 01:37:51.916]  Actually had people come forward and say that their share for their D.A.
[01:37:51.956 --> 01:37:53.617]  was used for political purposes.
[01:37:54.378 --> 01:38:03.225]  So we actually drew up a law that made it very specific that it puts the authority or the control in the Attorney General's office versus the Governor's.
[01:38:03.845 --> 01:38:05.566]  They have to do a very detailed audit.
[01:38:07.288 --> 01:38:09.069]  They have to use it only for crime fighting.
[01:38:10.152 --> 01:38:15.794]  And we passed the Senate, and it got caught up in the House procedural matters over voter ID.
[01:38:16.734 --> 01:38:19.655]  We stuck it on another bill, and then it died at the end of the session.
[01:38:19.735 --> 01:38:26.116]  But other stories have been written about the highway robbery in Tehran.
[01:38:26.177 --> 01:38:29.097]  It's in a small community about 15 miles north of Nacogdoches.
[01:38:30.038 --> 01:38:34.979]  Man, they've got a racket going there where the district attorney rides around with a local city marshal.
[01:38:35.965 --> 01:38:36.566]  I don't know.
[01:38:53.713 --> 01:38:59.458]  Sir, isn't that aggravated extortion when they're threatening criminal action if you don't waive your rights and give them the goods?
[01:38:59.478 --> 01:39:04.923]  Yeah, well I don't think it's pure robbery, and I am a little surprised that other authorities, I know the U.S.
[01:39:05.003 --> 01:39:06.505]  Attorney's Office is looking at it.
[01:39:06.965 --> 01:39:08.487]  You'd think the IRS would look at it.
[01:39:09.768 --> 01:39:11.109]  You'd think everyone would look at it.
[01:39:11.529 --> 01:39:15.133]  The problem is the state law, which was passed in 86, is so general.
[01:39:16.293 --> 01:39:18.515]  Well, no one has any authority.
[01:39:19.136 --> 01:39:23.939]  It normally would be the district attorney that would prosecute, but that's the person that's participating in this.
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:29.584]  Then I can drop down to Coville, Texas, where you actually had a district attorney and a district judge.
[01:39:30.623 --> 01:39:31.764]  We're good to go.
[01:39:59.051 --> 01:40:00.111]  So it's gotten out of hand.
[01:40:00.792 --> 01:40:04.954]  Let me tell you another impact it has on actually how you enforce and carry out the laws.
[01:40:05.694 --> 01:40:13.097]  Between Houston and the Mexican border, you obviously have a lot of dope going north, but you got a lot of cash going south.
[01:40:13.897 --> 01:40:23.001]  We've had testimony that some departments are much more persistent on trying to stop people going south with their money than they are north with the dope.
[01:40:23.982 --> 01:40:27.183]  So the abuses of this program are
[01:40:28.184 --> 01:40:32.407]  Outrageous, but they're also impacted in how people fight crime.
[01:40:32.747 --> 01:40:35.769]  Let the dope come through, but stop the cash going south.
[01:40:37.506 --> 01:40:50.014]  Well, what's amazing to me is when I see these CNN reports mainly, there's obviously been a lot of Texas reports and a few other national news, they go and interview these judges and police and district attorneys and they go, yeah, I'm keeping the money.
[01:40:50.354 --> 01:40:51.395]  Law says I can do it.
[01:40:51.815 --> 01:40:55.617]  Because it's so broad and I guess they've been boss hogging around.
[01:40:55.657 --> 01:40:57.599]  These guys even look like boss hog.
[01:40:57.619 --> 01:40:59.260]  I mean, it really makes Texas look bad.
[01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:01.701]  And obviously you've been making that point.
[01:41:01.781 --> 01:41:02.962]  Is there any end in sight?
[01:41:03.022 --> 01:41:09.385]  Because it seems like the heat you're putting on them, Senator, is doing a little bit, but it seems like it's still going on to a certain extent.
[01:41:09.886 --> 01:41:14.388]  Well, if keeping honest people honest, like I said, most of the departments do a good job.
[01:41:14.508 --> 01:41:23.853]  There are some borderline cases of the good departments using an excessive amount of the funds, in my judgment, for personnel.
[01:41:24.854 --> 01:41:28.056]  Instead of the county commissioners funding the sheriff's office or
[01:41:28.792 --> 01:41:36.939]  The court, they have now become so dependent on these funds that, in my judgment, that's not what it was intended.
[01:41:36.999 --> 01:41:41.283]  It's supposed to supplement what your orderly operations would be.
[01:41:41.804 --> 01:41:45.627]  So now you go down and, for instance, Mac Allen, we looked at their D.A.
[01:41:46.688 --> 01:41:49.791]  and most of the agencies being funded by
[01:41:50.603 --> 01:42:03.031]  These forfeited funds and, you know, the potential abuse there is that you get too aggressive and you cut corners to support your department instead of going to Commissioner's Court or the taxpayers.
[01:42:03.071 --> 01:42:05.913]  But they're going to fix it, I can assure you.
[01:42:05.993 --> 01:42:11.177]  I don't think the Governor will put it in this call for a special session, but we're going to stay on top of it.
[01:42:11.677 --> 01:42:18.882]  Alright, Senator John Whitmire joins us from Houston, separately but on the same line.
[01:42:19.875 --> 01:42:27.057]  Do you know the story of Captain Kidd, or do you know the story of Letters of Mark, or privateers?
[01:42:27.897 --> 01:42:40.581]  Throughout history, whenever they do this, and I know you're saying good idea at the beginning, it always turns into tyranny to have these Letters of Mark, these privateers, and that's what it turns the police into, like you said, funding themselves off this.
[01:42:41.141 --> 01:42:50.832]  To the point of they just set up whole checkpoints, violate the Fourth Amendment, start searching everybody's cars, they pull over families, tear their cars apart, because they're going to get promoted.
[01:42:51.613 --> 01:42:53.195]  They're going to get bigger checks.
[01:42:53.475 --> 01:43:00.483]  A lot of the narcotics officers get to drive the Corvettes and Tahos and Escalades they seize.
[01:43:01.444 --> 01:43:02.505]  I've grown up in Dallas.
[01:43:02.765 --> 01:43:06.268]  In our neighborhood, there were FBI agents that lived in drug-seized mansions.
[01:43:06.828 --> 01:43:15.354]  And so, this has been out of control for a long, long... I mean, I'm sure you know about Dallas, where the cops would throw the bags of chalk in the backs of cars?
[01:43:15.435 --> 01:43:16.375]  Yeah, I'm familiar with that.
[01:43:16.956 --> 01:43:23.580]  So, I mean... Well, it's not worse than a corrupt police agency, or the people that prosecute the law.
[01:43:23.621 --> 01:43:28.184]  I mean, you know, if you can't depend on them, who can you depend on, or trust?
[01:43:29.188 --> 01:43:33.529]  In my judgment, I won't speak for you, most do a good job.
[01:43:34.069 --> 01:43:40.891]  But you only need one or two to run a good program, and we've got to tighten this one up.
[01:43:41.191 --> 01:43:48.273]  But you are right, they drive around fancy cars, I can name some, particularly on the routes between Houston and Mexico.
[01:43:49.528 --> 01:44:16.350]  They come up, you can't imagine, we had one testimony from a sheriff's department, how many cars, people not only trafficking dope, but they're trafficking humans, and when they're pulled over, everybody runs for the brush and they leave a car there, and we got some agencies that have hundreds of cars, and you know, they actually had a lot of where they could give some away to the other county departments, but you know, there's got to be some accountability, it's got to be done for the right purposes, and none of these shakedowns or highway robberies
[01:44:17.162 --> 01:44:22.565]  Well, it's scary when you go to these East Texas towns and then to learn that it's going on around Austin.
[01:44:22.645 --> 01:44:25.386]  I'm really ashamed of the German Hill Country out there.
[01:44:25.406 --> 01:44:26.447]  Those have always been pretty moral people.
[01:44:26.807 --> 01:44:28.248]  I wonder how this started in our state.
[01:44:28.308 --> 01:44:29.048]  It's really shameful.
[01:44:46.007 --> 01:44:49.669]  Well, let me quickly also add, there's reports of it around the country.
[01:44:49.869 --> 01:44:54.331]  It's, you know, when you start out hearing what it's intended for, you can't argue with it.
[01:44:54.511 --> 01:45:00.575]  You know, take the profits away from crime, from the bad guys, and spend it to catch more bad guys.
[01:45:00.655 --> 01:45:01.695]  I mean, who can argue with that?
[01:45:02.496 --> 01:45:06.258]  But where we lose control is there's no accountability.
[01:45:06.278 --> 01:45:07.278]  There's no audit.
[01:45:07.318 --> 01:45:08.779]  There's no reporting mechanism.
[01:45:09.528 --> 01:45:16.229]  It's the original law written by the district attorneys primarily who wanted to be kind of independent to use it as a soft hit.
[01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:26.491]  You know, for years and years we've kind of heard stories, but no one wants to get after the DA or the sheriff because they run for office and they've got a following.
[01:45:26.992 --> 01:45:32.413]  But, you know, we got started on this path and we started getting a lot of stories and support.
[01:45:32.473 --> 01:45:33.873]  The media did a fine job.
[01:45:34.872 --> 01:45:41.302]  And the District Attorney's Association, who initially did not want us to tamper with the law, now are actually supporting our reforms.
[01:45:41.402 --> 01:45:44.107]  So, we're gonna fix it.
[01:45:44.127 --> 01:45:45.169]  I'll stay after it till we do.
[01:45:45.828 --> 01:45:48.090]  Will the reforms go far enough, though?
[01:45:48.130 --> 01:46:07.063]  Because once agencies and government history is shown get accustomed to powers, and they say that practice and custom and possession is nine-tenths of the law, I mean, this is kind of like if you have a cow that learns it can jump fences, you can start raising the fences up, it's going to keep jumping.
[01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:10.062]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:46:27.313 --> 01:46:28.114]  We're good to go.
[01:46:48.536 --> 01:46:48.957]  I understand.
[01:46:49.017 --> 01:46:51.862]  Senator John Whitmire, do five more minutes with us.
[01:46:51.942 --> 01:46:56.871]  I have a few more questions about solutions on the other side and how we get this bill passed.
[01:46:57.433 --> 01:46:57.793]  Stay with us.
[01:47:00.518 --> 01:47:01.399]  Spring is here.
[01:47:01.639 --> 01:47:02.419]  Growing season.
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:04.601]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:47:04.801 --> 01:47:06.202]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:47:06.522 --> 01:47:07.183]  Think about it.
[01:47:07.483 --> 01:47:11.346]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:47:11.586 --> 01:47:15.068]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:47:15.288 --> 01:47:17.850]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:47:18.110 --> 01:47:29.258]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family.
[01:47:29.258 --> 01:47:29.498]  I think so.
[01:48:00.345 --> 01:48:02.326]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[01:48:02.687 --> 01:48:08.670]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[01:48:58.979 --> 01:49:00.380]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:02.502]  A New World Order.
[01:49:03.203 --> 01:49:07.626]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new world government.
[01:49:07.706 --> 01:49:10.889]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:49:10.929 --> 01:49:13.171]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:49:13.711 --> 01:49:16.193]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:49:16.914 --> 01:49:24.240]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:49:27.256 --> 01:49:32.219]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:36.142]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:49:36.562 --> 01:49:39.044]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:49:39.124 --> 01:49:40.265]  Most people have no idea.
[01:49:40.285 --> 01:49:41.045]  They're not after money.
[01:49:41.085 --> 01:49:42.166]  They have all the money they need.
[01:49:42.346 --> 01:49:43.067]  They're after power.
[01:49:43.327 --> 01:49:44.027]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:49:56.015 --> 01:49:57.056]  You have been warned.
[01:49:58.357 --> 01:50:00.118]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[01:50:00.398 --> 01:50:03.120]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[01:50:03.341 --> 01:50:05.282]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[01:50:05.582 --> 01:50:06.363]  Here's the story.
[01:50:06.563 --> 01:50:11.167]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[01:50:11.367 --> 01:50:12.368]  Now here's the bad news.
[01:50:12.628 --> 01:50:17.451]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures.
[01:50:17.692 --> 01:50:19.533]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[01:50:19.813 --> 01:50:24.015]  Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[01:50:24.415 --> 01:50:29.618]  All this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in the healthcare services.
[01:50:29.918 --> 01:50:31.779]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[01:50:32.119 --> 01:50:40.824]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[01:50:41.124 --> 01:50:46.026]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[01:50:46.306 --> 01:50:50.228]  I recommend you visit this important new website at MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[01:50:50.408 --> 01:50:53.189]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[01:51:04.241 --> 01:51:11.844]  Senator John Whitmire from Houston, right here in Texas, has courageously been fighting what he calls highway robbery by the police.
[01:51:13.344 --> 01:51:16.905]  All the time you read about sheriffs, police chiefs in South Texas caught dealing drugs.
[01:51:16.965 --> 01:51:18.246]  I see that every few weeks in the news.
[01:51:19.266 --> 01:51:24.208]  Meanwhile, you've got them running around in East Texas and Central Texas and West Texas robbing people.
[01:51:24.668 --> 01:51:25.709]  Any other hot spots?
[01:51:25.789 --> 01:51:27.529]  And as you said, this is going on nationwide.
[01:51:28.169 --> 01:51:29.270]  CNN even admits that.
[01:51:29.310 --> 01:51:32.191]  But any other hot spots people should look out for?
[01:51:33.206 --> 01:51:42.973]  Well, I think every community ought to ask their police chief, their sheriff, their district attorneys, all these people who have this tremendous power of acquiring funds.
[01:51:43.574 --> 01:51:44.495]  How do you go about it?
[01:51:44.555 --> 01:51:50.739]  I mean, first of all, someone should be charged with a crime and a court should declare the funds forfeited.
[01:51:50.779 --> 01:51:53.722]  It should not be done just by some paperwork on the side of the road.
[01:51:54.102 --> 01:51:55.463]  So that would be the first inquiry.
[01:51:55.983 --> 01:52:01.908]  Then if the funds are acquired properly, everybody ought to ask, are they going back into fighting crime and not for
[01:52:02.614 --> 01:52:05.455]  Golf tournaments and whiskey and political purposes.
[01:52:05.495 --> 01:52:08.337]  There ought to be, you know, more troops on the ground.
[01:52:08.357 --> 01:52:09.617]  They ought to have better equipment.
[01:52:10.698 --> 01:52:16.421]  How do you take criminal funds, forfeited funds from the outlaws and then use it against them?
[01:52:16.901 --> 01:52:22.944]  So I think every community, every citizen ought to ask their local jurisdiction, how do you use forfeited funds?
[01:52:22.964 --> 01:52:31.028]  I mean, they can be used for a wide variety of crime fighting techniques, equipment, officers,
[01:52:32.571 --> 01:52:33.792]  Uh, I'll be honest with you.
[01:52:33.833 --> 01:52:35.315]  Drug courts could be funded.
[01:52:35.355 --> 01:52:38.780]  That's where you try to help folks who've got drug habits get off this stuff.
[01:52:39.602 --> 01:52:45.972]  There's a lot of things other than entertainment and fancy cars for some public officials.
[01:52:47.556 --> 01:52:49.036]  I was talking to you during the break.
[01:52:49.056 --> 01:52:52.837]  You're saying it's a good idea to call Governor Perry's office?
[01:52:52.857 --> 01:52:53.917]  Wouldn't hurt.
[01:52:53.937 --> 01:52:54.977]  You know, I'm going to inquire.
[01:52:55.017 --> 01:52:56.338]  He'll put it in the special.
[01:52:56.438 --> 01:53:05.699]  I'm not optimistic because there's a bunch of other things people want in there, but certainly wouldn't hurt to ask the governor to get control of forfeited funds.
[01:53:05.959 --> 01:53:08.840]  In fact, they currently report those funds to his office.
[01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:15.661]  He could probably, through executive order, do a better job of declaring how they could better enforce the use.
[01:53:17.199 --> 01:53:23.848]  Senator Whitmire, Barack Obama has talked about decriminalizing, not legalizing, decriminalizing marijuana.
[01:53:24.329 --> 01:53:30.197]  A lot of studies in Europe and other places show, and Mexico is looking at this because their whole society is collapsing from the drug wars.
[01:53:30.237 --> 01:53:31.598]  What about, I mean,
[01:53:32.179 --> 01:53:37.583]  Eighty years ago you could buy heroin and cocaine at every corner store and less people used it.
[01:53:38.484 --> 01:53:49.193]  What about not legalizing it but decriminalizing it so that there's not giant profits associated and then most experts believe that would really dissipate a lot of the violence.
[01:53:50.686 --> 01:54:02.129]  Well, it's an interesting discussion, probably don't have enough time today, but I've never really entertained that idea because I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon, but I did read with interest what Mexico's proposed this morning.
[01:54:03.050 --> 01:54:14.133]  You know, I'm not ready to decriminalize drugs, but certainly being smart about fighting them and dealing with people who have the habits which you're contributing.
[01:54:14.773 --> 01:54:16.715]  What about going after banks that launder the money?
[01:54:17.275 --> 01:54:21.979]  That'd be a hell of a good group to go get some of their felony forfeiture funds.
[01:54:22.359 --> 01:54:24.321]  No, I don't have a bill number.
[01:54:24.341 --> 01:54:25.182]  I really honestly don't.
[01:54:34.181 --> 01:54:37.083]  No, I know they're always changing it, too.
[01:54:37.123 --> 01:54:38.885]  Well, we actually put it on another one.
[01:54:39.145 --> 01:54:44.729]  Because of the mess put in in the House, it ended up on about three different bills, and I don't know the numbers right in front of me.
[01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.710]  No, I know.
[01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:47.471]  For those that don't know around the country... Well, it'll be a new number.
[01:54:47.511 --> 01:54:49.393]  It'll be a new number as we start over.
[01:54:49.833 --> 01:54:50.214]  Sure, sure.
[01:54:50.234 --> 01:54:59.461]  Because Texas, for those that don't know, only has a session every two years, so it's a wild, wild event with bills changing and things going wild.
[01:54:59.781 --> 01:55:02.383]  What about Texas being in session every year?
[01:55:02.403 --> 01:55:03.144]  Do you support that?
[01:55:04.165 --> 01:55:08.729]  No, I go back and forth, and you know I've been there a long time.
[01:55:08.749 --> 01:55:14.954]  I will suggest it's getting more and more difficult to do a good job in 140 days over two years.
[01:55:15.915 --> 01:55:26.744]  And I would dare to propose being there every year, not on all topics, maybe the budget for sure, but I will suggest what we've got now is pretty broken.
[01:55:26.964 --> 01:55:30.647]  I mean, our state is just, our government and our system hasn't kept up.
[01:55:31.275 --> 01:55:38.737]  With the growth of the state, on the other hand, you can draw a comparison with Washington who meets full-time and they don't do much better.
[01:55:39.057 --> 01:55:40.557]  Well, I've always been against them.
[01:55:40.577 --> 01:55:42.897]  How much government is something that I would be concerned about?
[01:55:43.418 --> 01:55:48.619]  Sure, no, I was about to say, I've always been against meeting every year because it allows the bureaucracy to stir up trouble.
[01:55:49.019 --> 01:55:50.979]  But I'm seeing in Texas the opposite.
[01:55:51.419 --> 01:55:57.080]  All the bad stuff gets passed, all the chicanery, like what Kirk Watson does, sliding stuff in.
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:55:59.461]  It almost seems worse, but I don't know.
[01:56:01.070 --> 01:56:02.872]  It's hard, you know.
[01:56:02.912 --> 01:56:15.382]  The problem is if we're not down there more regularly, the bureaucrats, the department and agency heads run things pretty independently of any of us while we're gone, so... So it's six one way, half a dozen the other?
[01:56:15.482 --> 01:56:16.283]  I could argue either way.
[01:56:16.983 --> 01:56:17.144]  Yeah.
[01:56:17.344 --> 01:56:21.547]  Okay, well, Senator, thank you so much for joining us on the show today.
[01:56:21.567 --> 01:56:22.428]  Alright, stay in touch, bye.
[01:56:22.568 --> 01:56:22.808]  You bet.
[01:56:22.828 --> 01:56:23.809]  Good luck with your bill.
[01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:27.052]  And that is Senator John Whitmire joining us from Houston District 15.
[01:56:30.014 --> 01:56:36.396]  And I tried to slip in the drug decriminalization and notice the big conservative guys now having to at least say he'd think about it.
[01:56:36.716 --> 01:56:38.916]  Because everybody knows this drug war is a fraud.
[01:56:39.517 --> 01:56:41.117]  We know who's making the money, the big banks.
[01:56:41.917 --> 01:56:43.298]  That's why they want to keep it illegal.
[01:56:43.758 --> 01:56:44.878]  Because that boosts the price.
[01:56:45.458 --> 01:56:47.479]  We'll be back with a lot of key news and information.
[01:56:47.499 --> 01:56:47.899]  Stay with us.
[01:56:49.139 --> 01:56:50.039]  We're on the march.
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:52.140]  The empire's on the run.
[01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:55.741]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:58.851 --> 01:57:00.393]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:57:00.533 --> 01:57:05.160]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:08.024]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:57:08.244 --> 01:57:11.088]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:57:11.288 --> 01:57:16.015]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:57:16.235 --> 01:57:17.155]  If you simply prepare.
[01:57:17.355 --> 01:57:20.277]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:57:20.597 --> 01:57:27.500]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[01:58:58.772 --> 01:59:00.272]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:59:00.453 --> 01:59:01.913]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:59:02.213 --> 01:59:09.616]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:59:10.016 --> 01:59:12.877]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:59:13.197 --> 01:59:16.678]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.

[01:59:29.667 --> 01:59:31.648]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[01:59:31.668 --> 01:59:32.969]  I use one every day.
[01:59:33.389 --> 01:59:35.850]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:59:36.090 --> 01:59:36.831]  We're good to go.
[02:00:05.333 --> 02:00:09.634]  Yeah, we've come a long way since the days of Andrew Jackson.
[02:00:09.834 --> 02:00:13.695]  In 1814, we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[02:00:13.995 --> 02:00:19.176]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[02:00:19.416 --> 02:00:21.957]  We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'.
[02:00:22.137 --> 02:00:24.558]  There wasn't as many as there was at one point.
[02:00:24.838 --> 02:00:29.839]  We fired our guns and they began to runnin' on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:00:31.357 --> 02:00:32.738]  We looked down a river.
[02:00:32.798 --> 02:00:35.460]  We looked down a river and we see the British come.
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:38.182]  And there must have been a hundred of them beatin' on the drum.
[02:00:38.202 --> 02:00:40.944]  They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring.
[02:00:40.964 --> 02:00:43.566]  We stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing.
[02:00:43.667 --> 02:00:46.409]  We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'.
[02:00:46.609 --> 02:00:47.870]  There wasn't as many of them.
[02:00:47.890 --> 02:00:49.431]  That was a Hoos like gesture right there.
[02:00:49.451 --> 02:00:51.833]  We fired once more and they began to runnin'.
[02:00:52.073 --> 02:00:54.315]  On down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:00:56.895 --> 02:00:59.176]  I'm getting better and better about covering it all.
[02:00:59.277 --> 02:01:02.598]  I just get stuck on the earth-shattering huge events in Iran.
[02:01:02.618 --> 02:01:04.580]  I get ready for war with them.
[02:01:26.189 --> 02:01:29.150]  North Korea trying to force them into launching a nuke.
[02:01:29.931 --> 02:01:30.931]  Globalist mean business.
[02:01:31.491 --> 02:01:36.874]  I'm going to get into this other news here about the water supply, the Feds federalizing that.
[02:01:37.694 --> 02:01:40.756]  Feds to get power to target websites making false claims.
[02:01:40.776 --> 02:01:42.977]  I mean, wait until we go over this.
[02:01:44.117 --> 02:01:47.059]  But first off, a few of the sponsors that have made today's show possible.
[02:01:48.052 --> 02:01:49.093]  Home Gain is one of them.
[02:01:49.513 --> 02:01:52.155]  Max the Little Orange Gorilla is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:01:52.195 --> 02:01:57.980]  He is the Home Gain mascot, so look for him when you're on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:03.504]  The website is H-O-M-E G-A-I-N.com.
[02:02:03.584 --> 02:02:04.945]  HomeGain.com.
[02:02:05.345 --> 02:02:10.409]  It's an absolutely free site, and it can save you or make you a lot of money, depending on if you're buying or selling a home.
[02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:11.970]  Been around for more than 10 years.
[02:02:12.010 --> 02:02:17.214]  You put in your address, it tells you what the market, what the realtors are seeing your house is worth according to the market.
[02:02:18.032 --> 02:02:20.372]  You know, depending on if they're telling you the truth or not.
[02:02:21.433 --> 02:02:28.414]  You can also do something like Home Sale Maximizer about what home improvements increase the sale price of your house for the smallest investment.
[02:02:28.954 --> 02:02:31.155]  And they've got a bunch of other systems like Street View.
[02:02:32.155 --> 02:02:36.596]  They've got just a bunch of great free services.
[02:02:36.716 --> 02:02:37.736]  Check this out.
[02:02:38.036 --> 02:02:38.996]  Do yourselves a favor.
[02:02:39.276 --> 02:02:40.517]  HomeGain.com.
[02:02:40.957 --> 02:02:43.657]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com today.
[02:02:44.838 --> 02:02:46.278]  And then, of course, this fabulous sponsor.
[02:02:47.875 --> 02:02:54.970]  When I found out that the owner of Front Sight was a fan of the show, it blew me away because I did a little bit of shooting contest.
[02:02:56.039 --> 02:03:11.026]  Back when I was in college, one of my dad's friends, Dr. Dillingham, got me into it, and we'd do competitive shooting with rifles at a thousand yards, and some of those obstacle courses where stuff's popping out, and you do different stuff with different guns, and they put it in a computer, and the cops would get mad.
[02:03:11.126 --> 02:03:15.328]  Like, the third time I did it, because I was like, out of 50 people, I'd be number three, and they'd get real upset.
[02:03:15.368 --> 02:03:16.889]  But, side issue!
[02:03:17.409 --> 02:03:20.071]  Those cops would get so excited when they were doing it and miss.
[02:03:21.151 --> 02:03:22.532]  But I wish I had time to do that today.
[02:03:22.552 --> 02:03:25.334]  The point is, everybody talked about how great Front Sight was.
[02:03:25.374 --> 02:03:27.275]  People are wearing Front Sight shirts now.
[02:03:27.355 --> 02:03:30.296]  It was the best, and it was better than law enforcement military training.
[02:03:30.336 --> 02:03:34.599]  And so, when they contacted us about being sponsors, I was really impressed with that.
[02:03:35.099 --> 02:03:38.601]  And then they have a deal they're offering for a limited time that I've never heard of them doing.
[02:03:41.022 --> 02:03:49.827]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza, the founder of the Front Sight Firearms Training Institute, is offering a free handgun and five days of firearms training to my listeners?
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:57.165]  This offer is only available for a limited time because Dr. Piazza is literally paying his own money out of his pocket to be able to offer you this deal.
[02:03:57.545 --> 02:03:58.786]  And it won't last forever, so listen up.
[02:03:59.146 --> 02:04:07.993]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at the Frontside Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[02:04:08.473 --> 02:04:13.157]  Act fast, and they will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:04:13.577 --> 02:04:19.722]  I believe now is the time for you and your family to be armed and trained to levels that exceed even law enforcement and military standards.
[02:04:20.242 --> 02:04:24.265]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:04:24.546 --> 02:04:27.088]  Thousands have already taken advantage of this opportunity, and you should too.
[02:04:27.388 --> 02:04:28.008]  Don't miss out.
[02:04:28.048 --> 02:04:30.070]  Go to the website FrontSight.com.
[02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:34.574]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[02:04:34.874 --> 02:04:38.937]  Or visit them by clicking the banner on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:04:39.338 --> 02:04:44.662]  What happens is I have one sponsor now, and then I wait until the end to do them all here together, so I appreciate everybody paying attention.
[02:04:44.682 --> 02:04:46.023]  These are all important sponsors.
[02:04:46.403 --> 02:04:47.024]  And lastly,
[02:04:50.245 --> 02:04:51.906]  Lastly, acolablue.com.
[02:04:52.346 --> 02:04:53.307]  I got one in my house.
[02:04:53.367 --> 02:04:54.287]  I got one in my office.
[02:04:54.427 --> 02:04:58.189]  It is the only water you can find that's guaranteed to have no fluoride in it.
[02:04:58.449 --> 02:04:59.550]  Because it gets into wells.
[02:04:59.570 --> 02:05:00.590]  It gets into bottled water.
[02:05:00.711 --> 02:05:02.011]  Most bottled water is out of tap.
[02:05:02.071 --> 02:05:02.772]  It's just been filtered.
[02:05:02.792 --> 02:05:03.592]  That's better than nothing.
[02:05:03.632 --> 02:05:04.332]  It does reduce it.
[02:05:04.773 --> 02:05:07.334]  This keeps it all out because it's out of the air.
[02:05:07.454 --> 02:05:08.595]  This isn't hooked to the tap.
[02:05:09.255 --> 02:05:10.636]  This is coming out of the air.
[02:05:11.037 --> 02:05:12.838]  This is coming out of the atmosphere.
[02:05:13.178 --> 02:05:14.900]  This is going into the illuminated tank.
[02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:19.263]  It goes through seven filters, including reverse osmosis and carbon.
[02:05:19.283 --> 02:05:19.463]  1-800-691-6043.
[02:05:19.483 --> 02:05:21.265]  1-800-691-6043 or acolablue.com.
[02:05:21.365 --> 02:05:22.846]  Get yours today.
[02:05:22.986 --> 02:05:35.516]  And they've even got little generators and solar systems that are very inexpensive on the site that go with the system, that are calibrated for it, where you can be out off the grid with this.
[02:05:35.556 --> 02:05:36.817]  I'll tell you, Jesse Ventura got one.
[02:05:38.112 --> 02:05:39.193]  Off record, you know, only on air.
[02:05:40.313 --> 02:05:42.054]  Okolablue.com, 800-691-6043.
[02:05:42.454 --> 02:05:45.976]  Now, he heard about them.
[02:05:46.236 --> 02:05:54.241]  First he saw one at Willie Nelson's house with me, and then he heard about them on the air and he's like, I want one of those in Mexico when I'm surfing!
[02:05:54.261 --> 02:05:56.582]  800-691-6043, okolablue.com.
[02:05:57.142 --> 02:05:59.424]  Okay, thank you sponsors, you made it all possible.
[02:06:00.344 --> 02:06:01.685]  Let's now go to the calls here.
[02:06:03.439 --> 02:06:04.580]  Let's go to the foreigners first.
[02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:07.022]  They're probably on IP phones, they may be on their own dime.
[02:06:07.302 --> 02:06:11.306]  Paul in Germany, then a little closer, 600 miles closer, Scotland.
[02:06:11.646 --> 02:06:13.347]  Paul, Jim in Scotland.
[02:06:13.587 --> 02:06:15.249]  Paul in Germany, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:17.351]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:06:18.311 --> 02:06:22.155]  It's really an absolute pleasure to speak with you.
[02:06:22.635 --> 02:06:23.416]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[02:06:23.456 --> 02:06:30.882]  I've been listening to you for about two years now, and about three months ago, I believe,
[02:06:33.221 --> 02:06:39.887]  I started subscribing to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:40.787 --> 02:06:41.568]  Well, thank you.
[02:06:41.928 --> 02:06:42.789]  You're making it possible.
[02:06:42.829 --> 02:06:44.330]  The support is very vital.
[02:06:44.951 --> 02:06:49.234]  Well, it's a pleasure, because if we don't support you, we don't support freedom.
[02:06:49.254 --> 02:06:51.096]  I lived all my life.
[02:06:51.116 --> 02:06:55.059]  I was born in 1951, and I believed in all the American dreams.
[02:07:01.847 --> 02:07:08.092]  And I always remember the midnight ride of Paul Revere.
[02:07:08.112 --> 02:07:15.958]  And what would have happened if Paul Revere did not put the saddle on the horse and do what he did?
[02:07:15.978 --> 02:07:29.368]  And what I see is that you are the Paul Revere and all the people that subscribe to you and try to put out the message
[02:07:30.206 --> 02:07:31.447]  Are Paul Revere's.
[02:07:32.948 --> 02:07:38.051]  Yeah, we should call it the Paul Revere Society, but I've got to do a variant of that because Michael Savage has that.
[02:07:39.632 --> 02:07:43.795]  Well, okay, well, you know, I'm not trying to coin a phrase or anything like that.
[02:07:43.815 --> 02:07:45.896]  No, no, no, I'm saying it's a great idea and I thought of it.
[02:07:46.256 --> 02:07:51.179]  I thought of like making like a pin, a hat pin or something with a Paul Revere, you know, like on a horse.
[02:07:51.339 --> 02:07:52.420]  We have a shirt with that on it.
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.581]  You guys give me the shirt, I want to show folks.
[02:07:55.102 --> 02:07:55.562]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:07:57.273 --> 02:08:16.299]  Well, what I'm saying is if we don't rise up, if we don't saddle the horse, if we don't do what we should do as American citizens, if we don't respect what our heritage is, then we can't expect much from our government.
[02:08:18.799 --> 02:08:19.479]  Absolutely.
[02:08:21.958 --> 02:08:23.961]  The World War II generation were great people.
[02:08:24.001 --> 02:08:24.922]  My grandpas were that.
[02:08:25.543 --> 02:08:27.124]  But I don't think they were the greatest generation.
[02:08:27.164 --> 02:08:28.286]  I really think it was the founders.
[02:08:28.306 --> 02:08:36.295]  If you really study history, these are people, Ticonderoga, dragging cannons through the snow, and their old shoes would break up and fall apart with a blood trail.
[02:08:36.816 --> 02:08:40.099]  I mean, these were... I mean, this is the prototype.
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:45.563]  And, you know, our World War II generation were great folks, but then they believed, oh, we're the good guys, everything's fine.
[02:08:45.843 --> 02:08:47.224]  Their kids were spoiled rotten.
[02:08:47.544 --> 02:08:48.605]  Their kids were demons.
[02:08:48.845 --> 02:08:49.325]  That's me.
[02:08:49.345 --> 02:08:53.848]  I mean, I own, you know, I mean, I got, young people really do have some serious problems.
[02:08:53.888 --> 02:08:58.891]  Very lazy, expect everything, and now they won't let the kids have fistfights, dodgeball.
[02:08:59.211 --> 02:09:01.673]  You go to jail if you do it, so then they just shoot each other.
[02:09:01.993 --> 02:09:06.396]  We're never allowed to experience true grit or develop any type of guts.
[02:09:07.410 --> 02:09:11.992]  And so we've turned into a nation of just, not all of us, but myself included, softies.
[02:09:12.372 --> 02:09:15.053]  We gotta get tough again, and we gotta get serious.
[02:09:15.073 --> 02:09:17.314]  People don't see themselves as Paul Revere.
[02:09:17.694 --> 02:09:18.935]  They don't respect themselves.
[02:09:19.595 --> 02:09:34.041]  That's why the mainstream media attacks me and uses COINTELPRO to demonize me and pull me down and say I'm not for real, because they're scared that if other people see themselves as Alex Jones, and Alex Jones sees himself as, you know, Paul in Germany,
[02:09:35.316 --> 02:09:44.300]  All of us start seeing ourselves as the answer, and realize it's up to us, then the New World Order is in deep trouble.
[02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:51.784]  So they have to destroy the idea that anybody's legitimate, that anybody could stand up so people don't believe in themselves.
[02:09:51.844 --> 02:09:56.226]  So yes, we need to saddle up, and people then want to saddle up in an incredibly fancy way.
[02:09:57.276 --> 02:10:00.679]  You know, you just gotta go to City Council and say, don't fluoridate my water.
[02:10:01.179 --> 02:10:04.602]  Or, go to City Council and say, we don't like the Feds taking over our highways.
[02:10:04.762 --> 02:10:09.045]  Or, go to City Council and say, we don't want S787 to take over all the city's water.
[02:10:09.505 --> 02:10:12.167]  Or, we don't want the IMF and World Bank taking over.
[02:10:12.207 --> 02:10:14.289]  We don't want a new banking dictatorship.
[02:10:15.410 --> 02:10:19.593]  And if we just do that, the new order can't win if we just say, no, no, no!
[02:10:20.073 --> 02:10:21.234]  And so I agree with you, my friend.
[02:10:21.995 --> 02:10:25.698]  It's trying to get people to actually do that.
[02:10:26.533 --> 02:10:31.074]  Well, they better get up off their butts and they better do it because the world is closing in.
[02:10:31.895 --> 02:10:34.315]  That is exactly the problem.
[02:10:34.915 --> 02:10:42.458]  Somebody like you, I have the utmost respect for what you've done and how you approach it.
[02:10:43.998 --> 02:10:50.260]  You woke me up along with David Icke and so on.
[02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:54.541]  When and how?
[02:10:56.052 --> 02:10:58.935]  Do we finally realize the revolution is here?
[02:10:59.455 --> 02:11:04.019]  It starts when you stop eating GMO, and we all fall off the wagon.
[02:11:04.059 --> 02:11:05.961]  It starts when you stop drinking fluoridated water.
[02:11:06.381 --> 02:11:10.325]  It starts when you get out of the petty programs, fighting with your wife or husband.
[02:11:10.805 --> 02:11:13.388]  It starts when you stop being a coward.
[02:11:13.408 --> 02:11:18.573]  The New World Order pretty much decimated the family.
[02:11:19.153 --> 02:11:20.675]  No, I know, I know.
[02:11:20.735 --> 02:11:26.361]  Listen, Paul, I know, and God bless you, and that's why we've got to pull it together and realize what they've done.
[02:11:27.322 --> 02:11:29.584]  Look, First Madison Avenue makes them feel inadequate.
[02:11:30.085 --> 02:11:33.389]  So a guy runs off because he deserves to have more women than just his wife.
[02:11:34.850 --> 02:11:35.571]  We're all hypocrites.
[02:11:35.591 --> 02:11:36.272]  None of us are perfect.
[02:11:36.672 --> 02:11:37.673]  I'm not up here on a high horse.
[02:11:37.693 --> 02:11:38.774]  I'm saying what we need to shoot for.
[02:11:39.841 --> 02:11:42.144]  Then it makes the women feel like they need more.
[02:11:42.184 --> 02:11:43.226]  Well, I shouldn't have to work.
[02:11:43.266 --> 02:11:44.468]  I shouldn't have to take care of my kids.
[02:11:44.508 --> 02:11:45.670]  I should be able to go out and have fun.
[02:11:46.491 --> 02:11:48.955]  That implodes society and creates bondage and pain.
[02:11:50.723 --> 02:11:56.826]  Number one, we've got to get confident and realize that we don't have to look like Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie to have value.
[02:11:56.886 --> 02:11:58.087]  That it's what our soul is.
[02:11:58.527 --> 02:12:02.789]  And that people are in danger, and that even if we're poor, there's people worse off than us.
[02:12:02.849 --> 02:12:05.090]  And by helping others, we build ourselves.
[02:12:05.130 --> 02:12:06.611]  I don't know how to, it's just a spirit.
[02:12:06.951 --> 02:12:09.232]  It's a spirit of liberty, spirit of goodness, spirit of freedom.
[02:12:09.512 --> 02:12:14.375]  We've got to grow that spirit in ourselves, and it's a light shining out against the New World Order in the darkness.
[02:12:15.095 --> 02:12:16.736]  Great, great points, Paul, but I've got to jump to others.
[02:12:16.796 --> 02:12:17.536]  Jim in Scotland.
[02:12:17.577 --> 02:12:17.997]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:12:21.147 --> 02:12:25.630]  I was wondering if you could tell me if anything you know about Project Camelot.
[02:12:28.172 --> 02:12:29.613]  Project Camelot?
[02:12:29.954 --> 02:12:30.454]  What's that?
[02:12:34.997 --> 02:12:39.041]  Jim in Scotland, you were saying something about... something about Camelot?
[02:12:45.485 --> 02:12:46.646]  Jim, are you still there?
[02:12:46.666 --> 02:12:48.668]  Now I'm curious.
[02:12:51.089 --> 02:12:52.369]  Okay, well I appreciate your call.
[02:12:52.670 --> 02:12:53.630]  That rings a bell.
[02:12:53.650 --> 02:12:57.031]  I think I've seen a YouTube channel that does interesting interviews or something like that.
[02:12:58.612 --> 02:12:59.452]  I'm not sure, though.
[02:12:59.952 --> 02:13:03.154]  Let's talk to Dave in New York.
[02:13:03.194 --> 02:13:03.834]  Dave, you're on the air.
[02:13:03.854 --> 02:13:04.234]  Go ahead.
[02:13:06.015 --> 02:13:06.555]  Hey, Alex.
[02:13:07.115 --> 02:13:13.017]  Just wanted to update you on the Farmingdale Homeland Security situation that we have going on here.
[02:13:15.433 --> 02:13:30.961]  I was hoping that somebody with a camera, I don't have the means to take pictures of it, but you know, this is a dry run for, um, decent blocking us off the train, putting us in security zones, and taking us down before they caught us off to the internment camps.
[02:13:31.321 --> 02:13:39.505]  Well, they admit, sir, they admit that TSA Nationwide is going to run checkpoints at trains and buses and search everyone and areas.
[02:13:39.885 --> 02:13:44.868]  We've gotten calls from all over the country, but it's in the news they're doing it, and so I
[02:13:46.343 --> 02:13:47.744]  I mean, absolutely.
[02:13:48.064 --> 02:13:50.586]  But, you know, they have disposable $5 cameras.
[02:13:51.007 --> 02:13:53.809]  They have really cheap little digital cameras now.
[02:13:54.349 --> 02:13:55.150]  They got cameras for $100.
[02:13:55.950 --> 02:14:01.014]  There's Sony that are, you know, like 5 megapixels at a 12 that shoot video.
[02:14:01.435 --> 02:14:02.836]  That's pretty good for YouTube.
[02:14:02.996 --> 02:14:04.237]  But where are you?
[02:14:04.277 --> 02:14:04.877]  What's going on?
[02:14:04.937 --> 02:14:05.678]  What do folks need to do?
[02:14:06.516 --> 02:14:12.999]  Well, some folks need to get down there and take a few pictures there in the New York area, going down to the Farmingdale train station.
[02:14:13.079 --> 02:14:17.341]  It's set up there like a Homeland Security disembark off to the internment camp.
[02:14:17.401 --> 02:14:19.122]  It's a practice run, a dry run.
[02:14:19.562 --> 02:14:28.226]  As a matter of fact, the PSA in their paperwork say that they won't just randomly check bags that we should all expect.
[02:14:28.888 --> 02:14:30.530]  For our bags to be checked.
[02:14:30.710 --> 02:14:32.151]  No, no, that was in the New York News.
[02:14:32.291 --> 02:14:33.292]  Everyone will be searched.
[02:14:33.312 --> 02:14:34.993]  They go, oh, it's not discrimination.
[02:14:35.134 --> 02:14:37.396]  All of you go on the secret list and can't own guns.
[02:14:38.256 --> 02:14:41.019]  They're openly saying millions more will be put on it.
[02:14:41.079 --> 02:14:42.140]  No judge, no jury.
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:44.202]  No way to find out how you got on the list.
[02:14:44.262 --> 02:14:47.184]  Just, I mean, it's so, it's anti-freedom.
[02:14:47.204 --> 02:14:48.225]  It's 180 degrees.
[02:14:48.486 --> 02:14:50.327]  If here's liberty, it's the opposite.
[02:14:50.768 --> 02:14:51.128]  I mean, you know.
[02:14:53.755 --> 02:15:00.998]  Just a dry run for the people who are going to the PGA Tournament to get off the train and get on the bus and condition them.
[02:15:01.158 --> 02:15:10.363]  They always do it at football games, high school games, with the Army showing up, the Kentucky Derby, big events, because people want to get in.
[02:15:10.403 --> 02:15:11.803]  It's like, well, you don't have to come in here.
[02:15:12.104 --> 02:15:13.004]  This is a private event.
[02:15:13.444 --> 02:15:14.565]  And they get you to waive your rights.
[02:15:14.605 --> 02:15:16.205]  But yeah, no, everyone's going to be searched.
[02:15:16.245 --> 02:15:17.106]  This is the new America.
[02:15:17.711 --> 02:15:26.983]  So every gentleman during the day but just to let you know I got off the train at 11 o'clock at night when all the PGA stuff was over with and what do I see?
[02:15:27.104 --> 02:15:34.834]  First thing I see is a cop hassling some young man with his sister and his mother in the car and a bunch of people standing around watching this cop
[02:15:35.214 --> 02:15:38.456]  Go animal on these people, apparently for no apparent reason.
[02:15:38.676 --> 02:15:39.196]  No, I know!
[02:15:39.236 --> 02:15:40.196]  They've gone crazy!
[02:15:40.216 --> 02:15:40.957]  They've gone crazy!
[02:15:40.997 --> 02:15:42.377]  They're stealing everybody's wallets.
[02:15:42.918 --> 02:15:44.738]  I'm telling you folks, this is real.
[02:15:45.259 --> 02:15:47.079]  They're telling the cops to act like this.
[02:15:47.500 --> 02:15:48.420]  They're moving on us.
[02:15:49.300 --> 02:15:51.822]  Sir, did you see Napolitano admit everything I said?
[02:15:52.242 --> 02:15:54.503]  Literally, he admits he listens to the shows and is a producer.
[02:15:54.823 --> 02:15:56.544]  That wasn't allowed on Fox TV.
[02:15:56.564 --> 02:15:59.185]  I'm going to play the whole thing in the next segment.
[02:16:00.746 --> 02:16:09.769]  It was only put on the internet, but here's Fox admitting the Federal Reserve will rule everything, no Bill of Rights, no Constitution, no nothing.
[02:16:10.189 --> 02:16:14.471]  Specifically though, you're witnessing the checkpoints where they're just having their way with people.
[02:16:15.371 --> 02:16:18.612]  Absolutely, and they heard you like cattle.
[02:16:18.792 --> 02:16:19.393]  No different.
[02:16:19.413 --> 02:16:26.355]  There's a bunch of people waiting on the platform to direct you to the place where you're going to wait in line to get your name checked off.
[02:16:26.395 --> 02:16:28.896]  Then from there you proceed to the security zone
[02:16:29.485 --> 02:16:37.094]  Where they pat you down and shake you down, put everything into a plastic bag so you have nothing in there that's going to intimidate anybody or anything like that.
[02:16:37.154 --> 02:16:37.554]  No, no.
[02:16:37.694 --> 02:16:40.317]  Life in America will be like the airports.
[02:16:40.358 --> 02:16:41.058]  I appreciate your call.
[02:16:41.118 --> 02:16:42.220]  Go ahead.
[02:16:43.915 --> 02:16:45.597]  Nobody says, you know what, I don't like that.
[02:16:45.657 --> 02:16:47.259]  Nobody says, I don't want that.
[02:16:47.319 --> 02:16:48.341]  Nobody going to the PGA.
[02:16:48.361 --> 02:16:50.764]  Everybody's going to line up and go, hey, I'm going to the PGA.
[02:16:50.804 --> 02:16:52.045]  Just do whatever you want to do.
[02:16:52.085 --> 02:16:53.467]  Hey, everybody to go to Disney World.
[02:16:53.547 --> 02:16:55.289]  Everybody to go to stores.
[02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:56.951]  Now it's grocery stores.
[02:16:56.991 --> 02:16:58.473]  They just say, got a hand scanner.
[02:16:58.493 --> 02:16:59.855]  You can't pay with cash or credit card.
[02:16:59.875 --> 02:17:00.235]  And I just go...
[02:17:01.363 --> 02:17:07.647]  And if you start saying no, they get on the phone and, security guards, security guards, I got one of them, and it's like, and the cops are like, why aren't you doing it?
[02:17:08.248 --> 02:17:09.969]  You're not with the Al-Qaeda.
[02:17:10.029 --> 02:17:11.130]  I mean, I'm not kidding, folks.
[02:17:11.150 --> 02:17:14.112]  They got them where, I mean, you can wear this to a grocery store.
[02:17:14.552 --> 02:17:24.399]  I've been wearing this in the grocery store and had security come up and look at it when I'm by myself looking at stuff and just like walking up and going, God, I got one with a Paul Revere.
[02:17:24.579 --> 02:17:25.820]  Oh, man, that Paul Revere was bad.
[02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:27.401]  That's worse than Jeffrey Dahmer.
[02:17:29.083 --> 02:17:30.784]  These people, just look at it.
[02:17:33.089 --> 02:17:34.090]  Live free or die.
[02:17:35.110 --> 02:17:36.291]  How dare me?
[02:17:37.052 --> 02:17:37.332]  You know what?
[02:17:37.352 --> 02:17:38.873]  I don't know if I have time for the Napolitano.
[02:17:38.913 --> 02:17:39.734]  I played part of it.
[02:17:40.094 --> 02:17:42.456]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:17:42.876 --> 02:17:46.198]  I want to get the feds to get power to target websites making false claims.
[02:17:47.239 --> 02:17:48.720]  And then I got these other articles here.
[02:17:48.740 --> 02:17:51.722]  The text of S-787 Clean Water Restoration Act.
[02:17:51.782 --> 02:17:53.984]  It's passed the Senate committee.
[02:17:54.384 --> 02:17:57.447]  And it's total federalization of all water!
[02:17:59.208 --> 02:18:02.150]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:18:03.755 --> 02:18:04.195]  I'm good.
[02:18:20.742 --> 02:18:21.422]  I think so.
[02:18:43.428 --> 02:18:46.091]  And, ship all orders over $50 free of charge.

[02:18:51.536 --> 02:18:52.197]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y today.
[02:18:52.277 --> 02:18:55.220]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:19:05.624 --> 02:19:10.967]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:19:11.507 --> 02:19:17.711]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:19:18.011 --> 02:19:19.832]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:19:19.972 --> 02:19:22.373]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:19:22.433 --> 02:19:33.319]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:19:35.629 --> 02:19:36.889]  It's not about left or right.
[02:19:37.289 --> 02:19:38.690]  It's about a one world government.
[02:19:39.150 --> 02:19:45.492]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:19:46.052 --> 02:19:53.834]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:19:54.314 --> 02:19:55.454]  The Obama Deception.
[02:19:55.895 --> 02:19:57.055]  The people strike back.
[02:19:58.675 --> 02:20:05.657]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[02:20:05.897 --> 02:20:10.198]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:20:10.438 --> 02:20:15.560]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.

[02:20:28.965 --> 02:20:34.428]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:20:34.829 --> 02:20:40.292]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[02:21:17.188 --> 02:21:21.009]  You know, the only reason the globalists might succeed is what they're doing is so over the top.
[02:21:22.089 --> 02:21:24.930]  I mean, just no Bill of Rights, no Constitution, you're all terrorists.
[02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:27.871]  We're going to put you on a secret list, not let you have jobs.
[02:21:28.351 --> 02:21:30.892]  We're going to track off an ID card, everything you buy, sell, and do.
[02:21:30.932 --> 02:21:33.332]  I read that 12 years ago off Club of Rome documents.
[02:21:33.712 --> 02:21:36.653]  Now Nancy Pelosi comes out and says, yeah, your whole carbon record
[02:21:37.333 --> 02:21:40.475]  Everything you buy, sell and do will all be chronicled on your national ID card.
[02:21:40.495 --> 02:21:41.816]  We want to adopt it worldwide.
[02:21:41.836 --> 02:21:43.257]  She goes to China and gives that speech.
[02:21:43.337 --> 02:21:45.979]  I mean, just total slavery, total control.
[02:21:46.459 --> 02:21:50.562]  Probably 30 times worse than 1984 in the level of surveillance and control.
[02:21:50.922 --> 02:21:54.545]  Bureaucrats just bureaucrating, nanny-stating you to death.
[02:21:54.865 --> 02:21:56.386]  All these, it's perfect plan.
[02:21:56.446 --> 02:22:04.571]  All these lazy, stupid Americans and lazy, stupid Europeans will be feeding and we'll all have little clipboards and power backed up with guys with machine guns.
[02:22:04.851 --> 02:22:06.112]  You don't like being our slave?
[02:22:07.473 --> 02:22:08.694]  Well, give us the property.
[02:22:08.714 --> 02:22:12.217]  I mean, I'm telling you folks, they mean business.
[02:22:12.237 --> 02:22:14.679]  They are big, fat parasites.
[02:22:15.480 --> 02:22:20.724]  So you want to be dominated by lesser men who know how to combine their forces together and gang-rape you financially?
[02:22:21.064 --> 02:22:21.624]  Get ready.
[02:22:23.206 --> 02:22:25.047]  They've introduced the Cyber Bullying Act.
[02:22:25.087 --> 02:22:29.471]  They got Hannah Montana, the TV character, the Cyrus idiot.
[02:22:30.370 --> 02:22:34.033]  That openly says the government will decide itself if you've hurt someone's feelings.
[02:22:34.353 --> 02:22:36.274]  Federal indictment, looks like that's going to pass.
[02:22:36.595 --> 02:22:38.496]  The hate crimes bills are probably going to pass.
[02:22:38.856 --> 02:22:41.258]  Feds to get power to target websites making false claims.
[02:22:41.338 --> 02:22:44.401]  Key story from PrisonPlanet.com, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:22:44.701 --> 02:22:53.908]  The Federal Reserve refuses to disclose where trillions of dollars in bailout money went, and yet the FTC is more concerned about snooping into the financial affairs of bloggers who make a few bucks off
[02:22:54.730 --> 02:23:02.717]  Affiliate relationships according to new guidelines set to be introduced next year that would give the government a foot in the door to regulate and shut down blogs for making false claims.
[02:23:02.737 --> 02:23:05.579]  And they say, we're going to do this for political stuff too.
[02:23:06.280 --> 02:23:08.722]  The FTC is now going to be everything.
[02:23:09.603 --> 02:23:11.344]  No judge, no jury, just look.
[02:23:11.985 --> 02:23:13.606]  Hand your money over at the barrel of a gun.
[02:23:13.626 --> 02:23:14.226]  We're the government.
[02:23:14.246 --> 02:23:15.327]  We work for offshore banks.
[02:23:17.789 --> 02:23:19.571]  Governor vetoes child abuse bill.
[02:23:20.712 --> 02:23:21.773]  This is out of the statesman.
[02:23:23.032 --> 02:23:30.055]  This is just incredibly good news, just came out, and admits that it would have violated the Fourth Amendment.
[02:23:30.235 --> 02:23:31.735]  You child molesters!
[02:23:32.095 --> 02:23:45.920]  You still try to run around, and you still violate the law and snatch kids, and now people are prosecuting you, because you get outside your agency purview, and that little immunity claim's being pierced, and you're, you big fat pedophiles are going to prison!
[02:23:46.220 --> 02:23:46.841]  Ha ha!
[02:23:46.901 --> 02:23:48.421]  You didn't get your stinking bill!
[02:23:48.561 --> 02:23:50.222]  We stopped you again, you maggots!
[02:23:51.098 --> 02:23:51.759]  I hate you!
[02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.143]  And we will defeat you and crush you, you maggots!
[02:23:54.864 --> 02:23:55.906]  We're calling you out!
[02:23:56.066 --> 02:23:57.488]  We're not counting anymore!
[02:23:57.688 --> 02:23:59.090]  We're not laying down anymore!
[02:24:00.012 --> 02:24:00.553]  Period!
[02:24:03.417 --> 02:24:04.439]  Unbelievable!
[02:24:07.432 --> 02:24:08.353]  We've got all this other news.
[02:24:08.433 --> 02:24:09.233]  It's just insane.
[02:24:09.353 --> 02:24:10.294]  Folks, you've got to read this.
[02:24:10.334 --> 02:24:15.777]  Tomorrow, I'm going to get some guests on about this, and I'm going to go hog-wild with this because it's set to pass the Senate and House.
[02:24:16.397 --> 02:24:19.940]  Imagine the federal government taking over all waterways.
[02:24:20.460 --> 02:24:21.360]  All water.
[02:24:24.921 --> 02:24:25.602]  Wetlands Act.
[02:24:25.622 --> 02:24:27.924]  They were taking people's property, saying they couldn't build on it.
[02:24:27.984 --> 02:24:30.226]  If it had like a puddle of water, you'd build a fence.
[02:24:30.306 --> 02:24:32.047]  They'd come seize it, put fines on you.
[02:24:32.287 --> 02:24:34.129]  People sued them and beat them because they didn't have that authority.
[02:24:34.489 --> 02:24:43.136]  This bill legislatively says all water, puddles, aquifers, everything, so they can then stop wells, put meters on your wells, tax you.
[02:24:43.357 --> 02:24:47.780]  In Austin, they grabbed over 20,000 acres from people under the guise of the aquifer with local scams.
[02:24:48.121 --> 02:24:50.623]  So imagine what they're going to do with this scam.
[02:24:51.564 --> 02:24:52.684]  Nothing to do with water.
[02:24:53.601 --> 02:24:57.282]  Totally targeting Texas and the South and places that don't have a lot of federal land.
[02:24:58.122 --> 02:24:59.943]  I mean, oh, I forgot the key.
[02:25:00.903 --> 02:25:05.484]  There is four to five times, we read the bill, buffer zones around a cattle pond, a creek, a river.
[02:25:05.744 --> 02:25:07.845]  So let's say you got a creek that ain't even on your property.
[02:25:08.225 --> 02:25:11.746]  They're going to claim no Bill of Rights that come on your property.
[02:25:12.106 --> 02:25:17.607]  They can do whatever they want with buffer zones that they decide around the land, around the water.
[02:25:18.148 --> 02:25:18.968]  So just, if you got
[02:25:19.688 --> 02:25:21.108]  Waterfront property, look out.
[02:25:21.128 --> 02:25:25.029]  Because here come the federal scumbag parasite filth.
[02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:27.450]  The bankers are imploding America by design.
[02:25:27.750 --> 02:25:29.951]  They've got to put the country in the receiver ship.
[02:25:30.311 --> 02:25:33.071]  And the ports, the roads, the water, it's all theirs.
[02:25:33.312 --> 02:25:36.392]  Unless we stand up and say this is illegitimate criminals, we're saying no.
[02:25:36.552 --> 02:25:37.653]  Retransmission starts now.
[02:25:37.713 --> 02:25:38.353]  Infowars.com.
[02:25:41.367 --> 02:25:42.808]  Spread the word about the show!
[02:25:43.128 --> 02:25:44.709]  Spread the word!
[02:25:44.749 --> 02:25:46.871]  Help us defeat the New World Order, baby!
[02:25:47.271 --> 02:25:47.591]  Yeah!
[02:25:47.631 --> 02:25:48.332]  Good job, crew!

[02:25:54.456 --> 02:25:55.617]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:25:55.757 --> 02:25:59.700]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[02:26:00.020 --> 02:26:01.561]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[02:26:01.881 --> 02:26:08.185]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.

[02:26:13.928 --> 02:26:16.709]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[02:26:16.929 --> 02:26:18.369]  And their formula really works.
[02:26:18.649 --> 02:26:21.210]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[02:26:21.470 --> 02:26:22.711]  Try the NutriCafe.
[02:26:22.951 --> 02:26:27.352]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.

[02:26:34.695 --> 02:26:35.816]  Go to www.
