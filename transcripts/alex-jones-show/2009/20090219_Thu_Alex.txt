[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.069]  Wow.
[00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:02.530]  Make an investment in your life.
[00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:03.691]  Life change tea.
[00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:05.432]  Oh, and P.S.
[00:00:05.652 --> 00:00:06.512]  You'll lose some weight.
[00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:13.175]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:13.536 --> 00:00:15.817]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:20.049 --> 00:00:30.417]  We normally go live at PrisonPlanet.tv during the third and fourth hour, but some days we do the whole show, simulcasting not just on radio, but on the internet streams at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:30.457 --> 00:00:35.441]  And I decided, why not go live with Alan Watt at PrisonPlanet.tv as well.
[00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:37.002]  So we just now went live.
[00:00:37.102 --> 00:00:41.326]  Alan, covering the Globalist Master Plan, the used carbon taxes,
[00:00:41.886 --> 00:00:54.536]  To control and micromanage and tax every facet of life, our diets, what we do, inspectors in our homes, taxing beef, chicken, when it's grown, when it's raised, and then on your table, that's all being announced.
[00:00:54.936 --> 00:00:57.879]  They would deny this, you know, now they're announcing their world government.
[00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:17.293]  Break down what you were covering earlier in the last segment in more detail, and then let's get into, with your deep research of the Globalist's own research and documents, which I can vouch for, I've researched it all as well, but you've intently researched it with your perspective, where this is going and what we're going to see in the next few years, the time frame of the rollout.
[00:01:17.353 --> 00:01:20.435]  But recap in more detail what you were just covering in the last segment.
[00:01:21.436 --> 00:01:25.059]  Yes, this is a script we're going through, a script that was written a long time ago,
[00:01:26.532 --> 00:01:37.247]  Basically drawn up by the big foundations that bypass democracy or any idea of democracy and the ones who funded the NGOs and all the think tanks that they own and run.
[00:01:37.587 --> 00:01:42.394]  These think tanks are the ones that advise all governments on policy.
[00:01:43.374 --> 00:01:46.135]  And so when you look at them all, it's one, it's the same policy.
[00:01:46.155 --> 00:01:48.956]  It's one policy out of a whole bunch of think tanks.
[00:01:48.996 --> 00:01:52.157]  They're all interconnected with the one globalist agenda.
[00:01:52.778 --> 00:02:04.222]  And all of these foundations and the Rockefellers and et cetera, they're all to do with eugenics, that they were always set up to do with eugenics, creating a new type of society, a reduced society.
[00:02:05.044 --> 00:02:06.765]  And actually going into the womb.
[00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:21.014]  I read something the other night from Tony Blair's interview that he gave to a newspaper on the fact that they're going to go into the womb and remove those genes basically that would cause someone to be violent or an extremist when they grew up.
[00:02:21.334 --> 00:02:32.518]  And for those that don't know, in my film Endgame, we have the mainstream news articles out of England where two-year-olds are put on probation with the police because of the, quote, genes of their parents.
[00:02:32.938 --> 00:02:38.020]  If their parents or grandparents ever committed a crime, they are now criminals at age two.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:48.044]  And they've talked about, in Oregon years ago, drugging babies in the womb if their parents are poor and show that they could be mentally ill.
[00:02:48.644 --> 00:02:49.225]  I'm not kidding.
[00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:50.607]  Prozac in the womb.
[00:02:50.647 --> 00:02:51.248]  Please continue.
[00:02:51.888 --> 00:02:53.551]  Yes, and it's more than just that.
[00:02:53.591 --> 00:02:57.896]  It's also something that was discussed over a hundred years ago at world meetings.
[00:02:58.938 --> 00:03:04.786]  And that was the necessity to identify those who could have leadership qualities down the road.
[00:03:05.772 --> 00:03:09.254]  And go against their agenda and get the public to follow them.
[00:03:09.674 --> 00:03:11.995]  That's also part of this big screening process.
[00:03:12.355 --> 00:03:18.958]  They've done the same thing with the drugging of children, mainly young males in school with the different drugs they give them, Ritalin, etc.
[00:03:20.278 --> 00:03:23.740]  These guys are generally very inquisitive.
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.121]  They ask lots of questions.
[00:03:25.761 --> 00:03:30.263]  They're diagnosed as being hyper because they ask questions or they're not happy with the answers they get.
[00:03:31.022 --> 00:03:31.482]  We're good to go.
[00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:48.174]  We're good.
[00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:06.521]  And they say there'll be a drastic reduction after the year 2050.
[00:04:06.921 --> 00:04:09.683]  The world they'll bring in too will also be a vegetarian world.
[00:04:09.823 --> 00:04:10.844]  That's on the cards.
[00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:17.448]  They say that the raising of livestock is just too labor intensive and cost intensive with carbon, etc.
[00:04:17.468 --> 00:04:22.452]  So they're going to eliminate meat for the masses and be left with the GMO foods.
[00:04:23.072 --> 00:04:25.694]  But population reduction is a big, big part of this.
[00:04:26.255 --> 00:04:29.217]  And eventually they hope to bring themselves through at the top.
[00:04:30.164 --> 00:04:43.499]  These wise ones, ones that think that they're superior and believe it so, with a technocratic and scientific elite coming through with them and just a few servants to basically supply their needs at the bottom.
[00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:46.982]  So this is their big agenda for their brave new world.
[00:04:47.543 --> 00:04:48.364]  And unfortunately,
[00:04:48.993 --> 00:04:49.894]  Thank you very much.
[00:05:05.034 --> 00:05:13.719]  They've had total indoctrination through the international educational system along the same path of sit back and enjoy yourself and don't complain about anything.
[00:05:14.359 --> 00:05:18.441]  We're talking about neo-feudalism in the Globalist's own words.
[00:05:18.681 --> 00:05:22.003]  Speak about the final revolution, the scientific elite.
[00:05:22.523 --> 00:05:26.566]  Integrated with the central banks, as David Rockefeller said in the quote I read earlier.
[00:05:53.443 --> 00:05:55.984]  Yes, it's even more insidious.
[00:05:56.524 --> 00:05:57.744]  They have done experiments.
[00:05:58.224 --> 00:06:19.889]  Arthur Kessler, who worked for MI5 and MI6 during the war, was also attached to think tanks in New York and experimental scientific laboratories for the United Nations, and he said that they'd already done experiments on lobotomizing that part of your brain which makes you you, uniquely you.
[00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:21.689]  He called it the ghost in the machine.
[00:06:22.623 --> 00:06:24.406]  And he said there's different techniques.
[00:06:24.486 --> 00:06:28.471]  One of them was delivery of chemicals to the brain via inoculation.
[00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:30.133]  It was very successful.
[00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:37.542]  And he also said, too, you won't need your survival capabilities because, again, the state will be making all your decisions for you.
[00:06:37.782 --> 00:06:39.583]  And Bertrand Russell said the same thing.
[00:06:39.623 --> 00:06:58.032]  He said, through diet, education, and other forms of brainwashing, and through injecting people, that humanity being able to rebel against their extermination would be as futile as sheep forming a rebellion against the practice of eating mutton.
[00:06:58.692 --> 00:06:59.173]  That's right.
[00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:00.013]  So Russell
[00:07:00.863 --> 00:07:06.124]  And Kessler, all of these guys, and Russell Kessler, by the way, both worked for MI5.
[00:07:06.484 --> 00:07:07.684]  That's in the open now.
[00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:08.744]  It's now declassified.
[00:07:09.224 --> 00:07:10.285]  It's declassified.
[00:07:11.345 --> 00:07:15.305]  And again, you have the Huxleys as well, who wrote about this in the 30s.
[00:07:15.966 --> 00:07:29.788]  Julian Huxley ended up running UNESCO, and he was quite open about the agenda of international education, which would, in reality, be an incredible scientific indoctrination, which would dumb the people down until they would accept anything.
[00:07:30.348 --> 00:07:34.833]  And they all were on track with the vast reduction of the population.
[00:07:35.314 --> 00:07:38.737]  And again, this brave new world where only the fittest would come through.
[00:07:38.757 --> 00:07:41.220]  They're all Darwinists, basically.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.504]  And they do believe they're more evolved than the rest of the general public.
[00:07:46.548 --> 00:07:47.168]  Absolutely.
[00:07:47.188 --> 00:07:53.951]  You know, when I've talked to globalists and people in the elite and their fellow travelers, they say, Alex, you're aware of all this.
[00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:55.372]  That means you should be one of us.
[00:07:55.772 --> 00:07:57.293]  Look, the slaves don't care.
[00:07:57.393 --> 00:08:00.774]  Notice how you tell them and they, you know, they don't care if we're putting fluoride in the water.
[00:08:00.794 --> 00:08:02.315]  They don't care if we're injecting them with mercury.
[00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:04.756]  They don't deserve to go into the future.
[00:08:05.336 --> 00:08:09.759]  And it's a very sick mindset, because they take the general public and dumb it down even further.
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:20.105]  They advertise eugenics as positive eugenics, advancing the elite, and negative eugenics, calling out the inferiors.
[00:08:20.165 --> 00:08:29.151]  But in reality, when you read deeper into eugenics, it's really about, as you said, suppressing the best in humanity that isn't evil.
[00:08:29.411 --> 00:08:34.354]  You know, they want the best of humanity that is evil, you know, that has their cold-blooded worldview.
[00:08:34.595 --> 00:08:41.520]  They're threatened by those on the light side who are intelligent and can go through and defeat all this propaganda mentally and make it through.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.242]  They want to neutralize and actually dumb down the mass.
[00:08:45.582 --> 00:08:46.623]  It is the ultimate crime.
[00:08:47.564 --> 00:08:52.587]  It's a crime, but see, they also run on these odd theories that become their realities.
[00:08:52.687 --> 00:08:54.769]  They force these realities upon the public.
[00:08:55.652 --> 00:09:10.815]  And we find out that in the US and in Britain, for instance, and most countries in the West, they implemented a policy from a philosopher, Isaiah Berlin, in Oxford University, who talked about negative freedom and positive freedom.
[00:09:11.415 --> 00:09:17.396]  And he said, we're running the world right now on negative freedom, where the people are basically kept dumb, stupid and happy.
[00:09:18.036 --> 00:09:20.457]  But there's very little interference from the state.
[00:09:21.383 --> 00:09:31.886]  And when Tony Blair was in, he wrote to this mentor and he asked, is it possible to combine that type of freedom with positive freedom?
[00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:37.948]  Positive freedom is where you get the whole world or all of society working like the Soviets towards some great new dawn.
[00:09:38.966 --> 00:09:45.470]  Working together, and he wanted to combine the two of them, and he asked this mentor if it was possible to do so.
[00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:50.552]  So, it's astonishing to realize they dumb us all down.
[00:09:50.672 --> 00:09:52.413]  They keep us dumb and stupid.
[00:09:52.693 --> 00:10:03.019]  They give us the worst education in a long, long time, and until we have no reasoning abilities for ourselves, they give us all the inoculations which do affect the brain.
[00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:04.519]  I have no doubt about that whatsoever.
[00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:05.480]  They target the brain.
[00:10:06.474 --> 00:10:09.277]  And then they blame us for being dumb and stupid.
[00:10:10.018 --> 00:10:14.523]  This is again a psychopathic outlook on the world.
[00:10:14.783 --> 00:10:16.525]  That's how a psychopathic would see it.
[00:10:16.565 --> 00:10:19.228]  He blames his victim for the state they're in.
[00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:21.830]  Absolutely.
[00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:37.036]  So you have this tiny, maybe 1 out of 500 people that's an actual psychopath, about 1 out of 100 that's a sociopath in the studies, and they create these guilds and then have their own pseudo-humanist religion that rationalizes the horrible things they do.
[00:10:37.076 --> 00:10:44.819]  And then for the general public, they tell them they're doing this for their own good, but in private and in their own white papers, they chortle with glee.
[00:10:45.539 --> 00:10:47.940]  It's the ultimate control freak's power trip.
[00:10:48.647 --> 00:10:48.907]  It is.
[00:10:48.927 --> 00:10:57.234]  I always liken it to a farmer breaking the legs on his cow and then kicking the cow because it can't get up.
[00:10:58.254 --> 00:10:59.716]  Because that's what they've done to society.
[00:10:59.756 --> 00:11:05.340]  They've crippled the reasoning abilities of the general public and they blame society for it happening.
[00:11:07.148 --> 00:11:08.009]  Very, very sick people.
[00:11:08.049 --> 00:11:09.830]  But that's a replay of feudalism.
[00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:16.373]  I've read 500, 600-year-old communiques between French and British royalty who were cousins.
[00:11:17.034 --> 00:11:18.574]  And we've got to have a new war.
[00:11:19.295 --> 00:11:20.556]  Our people are getting uppity.
[00:11:20.956 --> 00:11:22.677]  Oh, we need to keep them down this way.
[00:11:23.577 --> 00:11:27.680]  You need to rape their women so they don't have any family lines, because that psychologically breaks them.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.321]  You need to keep them at starvation level to control them.
[00:11:30.641 --> 00:11:31.822]  And that's what feudalism was.
[00:11:32.182 --> 00:11:36.665]  Not allowing to hunt, not allowing to have firewood, having to give most of what they produce to the elites.
[00:11:36.705 --> 00:11:39.667]  The elites would be a foot and a half taller.
[00:11:39.947 --> 00:11:41.708]  They called the slaves the little people.
[00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:48.172]  And they enjoyed the fact that they were starving and had snot running down their faces as they rode by in their finery.
[00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:50.753]  And in Japan they had the same system.
[00:11:51.094 --> 00:11:53.235]  This is what slave masters do.
[00:11:53.815 --> 00:11:55.098]  They hate us doing well.
[00:11:55.158 --> 00:11:56.420]  They hate us being beautiful.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.842]  They hate our ideas.
[00:11:58.083 --> 00:12:05.996]  They hate the fact that it's the hybrid individual system that is actually more dynamic than them and that rises from the general mass.
[00:12:08.177 --> 00:12:16.263]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:12:16.423 --> 00:12:20.826]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:12:20.986 --> 00:12:25.509]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:27.070]  It's a documented fact.
[00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:34.533]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:12:34.694 --> 00:12:46.539]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.
[00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:50.461]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[00:12:51.061 --> 00:12:53.463]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[00:12:54.203 --> 00:12:57.885]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.

[00:13:01.428 --> 00:13:02.028]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:13:08.312 --> 00:13:21.027]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:28.216]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:13:28.556 --> 00:13:32.117]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:13:32.497 --> 00:13:35.698]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:13:35.918 --> 00:13:43.419]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[00:13:43.799 --> 00:13:49.000]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.121]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the
[00:13:52.281 --> 00:13:52.882]  I'm good.
[00:14:09.448 --> 00:14:10.550]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:10.950]  February 19, 2009.
[00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.012]  Gold opened at $981.40.
[00:14:12.052 --> 00:14:14.755]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $1,919.00, $504.59 for half, $252.30 for quarter.
[00:14:14.815 --> 00:14:15.256]  That's $1,919.00, $504.59, and $252.30.
[00:14:27.088 --> 00:14:28.148]  We all want liberty.
[00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:29.589]  Some give their lives for it.
[00:14:29.749 --> 00:14:31.610]  A price that cannot be taken for granted.
[00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.891]  We forfeit bites and pieces of our freedom.
[00:14:34.011 --> 00:14:34.511]  For what?
[00:14:34.731 --> 00:14:46.075]  February 28th, Minnesota Campaign for Liberty will host Tom Woods, best-selling author of The Meltdown, Professor Butler, author of Trade on the Great Depression, and Bill Butler to cover monetary policy.
[00:14:46.295 --> 00:14:46.836]  We're good to go.
[00:15:08.752 --> 00:15:12.333]  Do you have trouble sleeping due to sensations in your legs?
[00:15:24.738 --> 00:15:25.278]  I don't know.

[00:16:08.453 --> 00:16:10.554]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:16:11.114 --> 00:16:13.895]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:16:16.477 --> 00:16:26.125]  Alan, I'd like you to specifically get into who Barack Obama is, the betrayals we've already witnessed, and how he was perfectly packaged, you know, from your own perspective.
[00:16:26.886 --> 00:16:31.490]  Because, you know, they build up all this hatred of Bush, who certainly deserved it, but he's still just a front for the globalists.
[00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:35.834]  All of our energies are put into, you know, him instead of what the elites are actually doing behind the scenes.
[00:16:36.909 --> 00:16:38.030]  Yeah, it's just they're all puppets.
[00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.811]  It's a new puppet.
[00:17:05.174 --> 00:17:11.280]  And a new puppet show for the public because the last puppet show was becoming disgusting.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.702]  We always get disgusted with politicians.
[00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:15.004]  That's what they say about democracy.
[00:17:15.024 --> 00:17:18.187]  You don't vote new people in, you vote the last bunch out.
[00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:19.588]  You're so sick of them.
[00:17:20.409 --> 00:17:22.371]  And they're putting in this man because
[00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:25.150]  We've seen so much corruption over the years.
[00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:29.971]  The politics and politicians were losing their favor in the eyes of the public.
[00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:31.212]  We're losing all respect for them.
[00:17:31.712 --> 00:17:34.233]  In fact, that's why they came in with the idea of terrorism.
[00:17:34.253 --> 00:17:36.633]  They gave government a new command over the public.
[00:17:36.673 --> 00:17:38.954]  That was the main idea behind it.
[00:17:39.634 --> 00:17:41.475]  A new myth for the age of terrorism.
[00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.512]  But Barack Obama is just another one of their boys.
[00:17:45.572 --> 00:17:47.893]  You can see all of his connections, the CFR and so on.
[00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:49.494]  He's committed to their agenda.
[00:17:49.514 --> 00:17:51.995]  He's given many speeches at the CFR.
[00:17:52.035 --> 00:17:53.576]  You can actually find them on the web.
[00:17:54.436 --> 00:17:57.477]  And he's all gung-ho for this whole New World Order idea.
[00:17:57.918 --> 00:18:03.580]  Now he's just sent off another 75,000 troops to Afghanistan or something.
[00:18:04.001 --> 00:18:05.681]  I mean, he's going right along with it.
[00:18:06.022 --> 00:18:08.843]  And he's got Brzezinski backing him up as well with his policies.
[00:18:09.143 --> 00:18:10.344]  The very man who helped
[00:18:12.205 --> 00:18:30.676]  And that's what's so arrogant about it is that Obama, even more than Bush, will go on Stephanopoulos' show, other shows, on every issue, on NAFTA, on GATT, on torture, on secret arrest, on expanding the war, and he'll just say, oh that was just campaign rhetoric.
[00:18:30.976 --> 00:18:35.039]  And they go, oh yeah, I lied to you, it's no big deal.
[00:18:35.768 --> 00:18:36.569]  That's right.
[00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.911]  It's the same old stuff.
[00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:43.777]  And I think those of us who get a bit older have seen so much of this our whole lives long, we take no interest in them at all.
[00:18:43.797 --> 00:18:44.618]  They're born liars.
[00:18:44.659 --> 00:18:46.320]  That's why they're picked there and put there.
[00:18:47.562 --> 00:18:50.485]  I don't think you find ordinary people trying to get into politics.
[00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:53.289]  You certainly won't find them getting up there in politics.
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.441]  Because the psychopathic types gravitate towards politics.
[00:18:57.461 --> 00:18:58.321]  They like the power.
[00:18:58.761 --> 00:18:59.842]  They're natural liars.
[00:18:59.922 --> 00:19:02.163]  They're at home amongst other psychopaths.
[00:19:02.763 --> 00:19:05.604]  And so that's the only type, unfortunately, that seems to get in there.
[00:19:05.964 --> 00:19:07.424]  But they're not the bosses, as we know.
[00:19:08.084 --> 00:19:13.986]  We know that it's the big foundations with their advising think tanks that are the policy makers.
[00:19:14.406 --> 00:19:16.967]  The politicians really are just, are nothing more than front men.
[00:19:18.766 --> 00:19:19.446]  Absolutely.
[00:19:19.547 --> 00:19:21.328]  Let's get into the next ten years.
[00:19:22.608 --> 00:19:23.629]  Is the program behind?
[00:19:23.709 --> 00:19:24.669]  Is it on schedule?
[00:19:24.709 --> 00:19:33.254]  What will we see unfold in the next year, the next two years, the next five, the next seven, you know, on into ten, if they're continuing with their program successfully?
[00:19:34.135 --> 00:19:39.498]  Well, I know that Brzezinski and Kissinger both said the same things, that the United States now must take the back seat.
[00:19:40.422 --> 00:19:40.622]  I think?
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.160]  We'll take Finland!
[00:20:31.713 --> 00:20:32.394]  Take Finland.
[00:20:32.434 --> 00:20:36.817]  I mean, as you know, over a decade ago, all your bank accounts are controlled by the government.
[00:20:37.097 --> 00:20:39.599]  When you get a ticket or a fine, they just take it out of your account.
[00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:44.423]  It's taken out of your account according to how much money you have, so it's class warfare society.
[00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:47.025]  The government admits they listen to all cell phone calls.
[00:20:47.365 --> 00:20:49.086]  The Finns have been conditioned to accept that.
[00:20:49.207 --> 00:20:50.007]  Everything's tracked.
[00:20:50.387 --> 00:20:51.308]  Everything's controlled.
[00:20:51.628 --> 00:20:52.909]  They euthanize the old.
[00:20:55.391 --> 00:21:01.035]  Abortion on demand, one-child policy basically being brought in, and now we're hearing them hype that here as well.
[00:21:01.075 --> 00:21:03.857]  So this is a hellish society of micromanagement.
[00:21:04.338 --> 00:21:05.279]  Yes, and it is global.
[00:21:05.479 --> 00:21:08.701]  Again, the UN was set up as the front for this organization.
[00:21:09.842 --> 00:21:18.068]  Once again, the same foundations and Rockefellers and so on, Ford, Carnegie, were the ones who started, set up the United Nations and funded it into existence.
[00:21:18.984 --> 00:21:26.023]  Uh, they're the real bosses here and what's astonishing is to find old Rockefeller in 94 still going around the world
[00:21:26.756 --> 00:21:34.698]  Giving talks to globalist societies and meetings about the depopulation of the planet being of utmost urgency.
[00:21:35.038 --> 00:21:36.999]  He's never changed his tune his whole life.
[00:21:37.039 --> 00:21:39.479]  He's as adamant now as he was when he was 18.
[00:21:39.739 --> 00:21:46.821]  And that's official State Department policy under State Department Memorandum 200 by Henry Kissinger and the classified CIA version of that.
[00:21:47.281 --> 00:21:50.002]  The extermination of the world population is the goal.
[00:21:50.422 --> 00:21:52.483]  World government is only the means to the end.
[00:21:52.803 --> 00:21:53.463]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:58.228 --> 00:21:59.110]  We're on the march.
[00:21:59.632 --> 00:22:01.195]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:22:01.215 --> 00:22:04.844]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:08.211 --> 00:22:11.253]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:22:11.693 --> 00:22:14.995]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:22:15.475 --> 00:22:21.419]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:22:21.779 --> 00:22:25.922]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:22:26.422 --> 00:22:32.145]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:22:32.446 --> 00:22:35.447]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:22:40.623 --> 00:22:40.783]  I think?
[00:22:58.829 --> 00:23:03.412]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:23:03.432 --> 00:23:05.333]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:23:17.614 --> 00:23:18.635]  But who is the enemy?
[00:23:19.155 --> 00:23:19.656]  Bin Laden.
[00:23:19.956 --> 00:23:20.957]  This is his M.O.
[00:23:20.977 --> 00:23:22.277]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:23:22.318 --> 00:23:23.959]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:23:24.319 --> 00:23:31.064]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:23:31.464 --> 00:23:31.905]  Some U.S.
[00:23:31.945 --> 00:23:37.629]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:23:38.289 --> 00:23:41.791]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:23:42.171 --> 00:23:52.037]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:23:52.277 --> 00:23:53.018]  Fabled enemies.

[00:25:25.843 --> 00:25:28.266]  I won't even turn my head.
[00:25:28.326 --> 00:25:29.747]  Alright, we're back live folks.
[00:25:29.787 --> 00:25:31.008]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:25:31.048 --> 00:25:32.589]  Let's go right back to Alan Watt.
[00:25:37.296 --> 00:25:40.118]  Alan, I want to go to some phone calls.
[00:25:40.158 --> 00:25:41.559]  They'll be all over the map.
[00:25:42.059 --> 00:25:42.539]  That's fine.
[00:25:42.579 --> 00:25:44.661]  You can speak to all major issues.
[00:25:45.341 --> 00:25:46.762]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:46.782 --> 00:25:46.842]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:46.862 --> 00:25:48.043]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.692]  In fact, just give me a new fresh list, John, because I know folks have been holding a while.
[00:26:02.653 --> 00:26:11.739]  Continuing with how they're going to phase this in, I want listeners and viewers out there, we are simulcasting right now at PrisonPlanet.tv, to understand something.
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.641]  We're not joking about any of this.
[00:26:14.421 --> 00:26:19.985]  Remember, I've been on air more than 13 years now, just going off government documents and their own statements.
[00:26:20.706 --> 00:26:21.787]  Just two years ago,
[00:26:23.191 --> 00:26:32.016]  I would have globalists on this show like Mr. Rothschild and he would say, there's no plan for a global tax and laugh when I have the congressional hearings with his own group pushing for it.
[00:26:35.538 --> 00:26:37.180]  You know, they said they weren't building a world government.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.401]  We had all their own documents.
[00:26:38.961 --> 00:26:48.891]  Judicial watch would sue and get the SPP documents and they'd say, we gotta keep it secret from the public, it's a new world order, we're gonna take their liberties through phony environmentalism and the threat of phony terrorism.
[00:26:49.432 --> 00:26:50.293]  It's declassified.
[00:26:50.313 --> 00:26:54.177]  The US, the British and others have staged hundreds of terror attacks on record.
[00:26:55.978 --> 00:26:57.460]  So of course we look at 9-11 and then
[00:26:58.789 --> 00:27:00.490]  Go to the evidence that it was an inside job.
[00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:02.911]  It's time to stop being childlike.
[00:27:02.951 --> 00:27:11.755]  And I know this stuff is so scary that a lot of people want to rationalize or make excuses and say it isn't real because it's just too painful for them to imagine.
[00:27:12.735 --> 00:27:23.200]  But when the official army training manual for all army captains in special operations teaches them how to stage terror attacks and false flags, I mean, we have to live in the real world here.
[00:27:24.201 --> 00:27:26.542]  We have to face the evidence.
[00:27:27.734 --> 00:27:30.015]  And they are engaging in eugenics.
[00:27:30.036 --> 00:27:35.359]  They are pushing one-child policies now in the West, saying that they're going to tax your carbon footprint having more than one child.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.700]  This is unfolding.
[00:27:39.421 --> 00:27:41.402]  Alan, there is a mass awakening happening.
[00:27:41.743 --> 00:27:45.485]  So I see a lot of positive things happening, and I know the globalists aren't invincible.
[00:27:45.845 --> 00:27:49.908]  No matter how sophisticated their propaganda is, being aware of it, is the battle.
[00:27:50.308 --> 00:27:55.171]  Forty-plus billion dollars the Pentagon is going to use in the US and worldwide to fix their image.
[00:27:55.751 --> 00:27:59.873]  And then you watch HBO and it's PR pieces for the military.
[00:28:00.474 --> 00:28:02.515]  There's military pamphlets everywhere.
[00:28:02.855 --> 00:28:04.356]  It's all over the news.
[00:28:04.776 --> 00:28:06.717]  Isn't that a sign of being in a police state?
[00:28:06.757 --> 00:28:18.244]  I mean, we are so propagandized with the fake news and the fake reporters and all of the news packaging that Congress admits is going on and it's only intensifying.
[00:28:18.584 --> 00:28:21.406]  Can't that propaganda backfire on the establishment?
[00:28:22.226 --> 00:28:27.172]  Or because they're just immersing the population from every angle with it, will it be effective?
[00:28:28.713 --> 00:28:42.248]  It's been effective so far, as I say, when you go into, there's a good video up there by a guy who does a lot of work for the BBC, Adam Curtis, it's called The Power of Nightmares, and he goes in
[00:28:42.887 --> 00:29:10.240]  to the psychology behind setting up a world of terrorism and how politicians needed this because if they were losing all respect from the general public they were so corrupt that they needed this new authority and the authority is we are here to protect you and they created a myth of terrorism worldwide of course this myth was to be expanded to include anyone who was politically incorrect on many topics various topics that's what's happening today it's a tool
[00:29:10.936 --> 00:29:16.758]  It's a tool and terror is being used on the general public by the politicians and the governments.
[00:29:17.318 --> 00:29:31.142]  They're chasing shadows looking for terrorism everywhere and Adam Curtis did an excellent job of exposing this using documents that they had stored in the BBC archives to show you the whole thing was a farce from the beginning to end.
[00:29:31.782 --> 00:29:32.643]  But it's unnecessary.
[00:29:32.923 --> 00:29:40.005]  This comes back down to the neoconservatives who dreamed up the policy taken from Leo Strauss who taught Wolfowitz and others
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:45.765]  Uh, the fact that they need, they need a myth for every age to get their agenda through.
[00:29:46.466 --> 00:29:49.348]  And they created the myth of terrorism everywhere.
[00:29:49.368 --> 00:29:53.032]  It's a, it's an exaggeration of the old Reds under the bed scare.
[00:29:53.412 --> 00:29:54.634]  It's much worse than that.
[00:29:55.214 --> 00:29:58.918]  Another expanding terrorism to include anyone who speaks out and fight.
[00:29:59.851 --> 00:30:04.334]  So, this is the technique that they must use now until they finish this whole agenda.
[00:30:04.975 --> 00:30:10.659]  And they even have environmental terrorism now, if you don't put your garbage in the right boxes, etc, etc.
[00:30:10.999 --> 00:30:12.300]  It all comes under terrorism.
[00:30:13.087 --> 00:30:17.833]  So, this is the noble lie that they're using to bring this whole agenda forward.
[00:30:18.293 --> 00:30:30.587]  They must create a state of fear, and when the public get into a state of panic and stampede, as long as they are heading off the cattle at the head of the herd, they can guide us into this new world order.
[00:30:30.888 --> 00:30:32.029]  That's their whole theory.
[00:30:32.309 --> 00:30:33.511]  That's what it's based upon.
[00:30:34.271 --> 00:30:43.400]  And the public have got to stop being afraid, and they've got to stop obeying ridiculous laws that are thrown at them, because we know where it's to go.
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:50.026]  It's to go into an Orwellian world where you'll need to believe and speak, double-speak all the time to survive.
[00:30:50.767 --> 00:30:52.088]  They've got cameras up for you.
[00:30:52.428 --> 00:30:56.532]  Any little expression that they deem might be anger,
[00:30:57.807 --> 00:31:03.860]  Or you're being upset means they have to get into you and intervene right away by drugging you or whatever is necessary.
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:05.801]  This is the world they're bringing in.
[00:31:05.901 --> 00:31:07.023]  Total control.
[00:31:07.083 --> 00:31:14.169]  It's a hellish control where you have no freedom for it to do anything whatsoever except that which is authorized by the top.
[00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:16.872]  That was the next issue.
[00:31:16.892 --> 00:31:18.674]  I was going to bring up the whole control grid.
[00:31:19.114 --> 00:31:27.262]  They admit that in England and the United States, the two major beta test centers, Australia as well, the Anglo-American system, New Zealand, Canada,
[00:31:28.942 --> 00:31:33.987]  It's admitted that first they trained you how to go through a checkpoint and be searched, put your stuff through a metal detector.
[00:31:34.387 --> 00:31:35.949]  Then they begin asking you questions.
[00:31:35.989 --> 00:31:37.250]  Then you take your shoes off.
[00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:38.732]  An act of submission.
[00:31:38.992 --> 00:31:41.034]  Then you can't bring liquids in or toothpaste.
[00:31:41.394 --> 00:31:42.615]  Another act of submission.
[00:31:42.816 --> 00:31:44.017]  You've got to hold your pants up.
[00:31:44.878 --> 00:31:45.358]  Exactly.
[00:31:45.438 --> 00:31:46.219]  Show your body.
[00:31:46.299 --> 00:31:48.861]  Women have to drink the milk they pump for their baby.
[00:31:51.249 --> 00:31:53.550]  They are putting in at 200 airports in the U.S.
[00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:59.933]  these body scanners that scan your 360 biometric signature so their cameras can now track and trace you.
[00:32:00.373 --> 00:32:05.735]  Another active submission, they admit it's the naked image of your body scanned onto their hard drives.
[00:32:06.335 --> 00:32:10.237]  They now admit they're doing that and then now they're talking about putting metal detectors in shopping malls.
[00:32:10.617 --> 00:32:12.197]  In the schools it's already happening.
[00:32:12.478 --> 00:32:14.038]  Thumb scanning to buy and sell.
[00:32:14.118 --> 00:32:17.700]  Cash being phased out by major airlines and businesses.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.961]  All Pavlovian dog training.
[00:32:21.201 --> 00:32:24.063]  In their own words, to train us to submit it.
[00:32:24.083 --> 00:32:30.327]  Now suddenly, if you had an anti-Bush sticker, they would pull you over and take you to jail or ticket you or put you in a terror database.
[00:32:30.647 --> 00:32:31.708]  In England they started that.
[00:32:31.748 --> 00:32:33.789]  It happened to me when I was over there videotaping from the street.
[00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:36.311]  Now it's illegal in England to videotape anything.
[00:32:36.611 --> 00:32:44.016]  An act of terrorism, the police decide that if somebody can even find it on the web and use it, that way you can't videotape them brutalizing people.
[00:32:44.056 --> 00:32:47.618]  I mean, it's all coming into play now.
[00:32:48.379 --> 00:32:48.799]  Yes it is.
[00:32:49.725 --> 00:32:51.867]  And once again, it falls in with it.
[00:32:51.907 --> 00:32:55.149]  You see, there's actually handbooks on terrorism, how to implement it.
[00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:59.792]  And Russell, Bertrand Russell, had studied this technique.
[00:33:00.473 --> 00:33:02.814]  And he said, we must create a condition of apathy.
[00:33:03.935 --> 00:33:08.959]  And as you say, by ridiculing people, taking away their basic
[00:33:10.381 --> 00:33:15.613]  Making them...dehumiliating the public, in other words, is the greatest form of creating apathy.
[00:33:15.673 --> 00:33:19.482]  They feel helpless, just like the pris... In fact, you get a prisoner of war syndrome.
[00:33:20.743 --> 00:33:29.552]  Even though you're not behind bars, you're walking within the general public, you get a syndrome that you get in prison camps where you feel apathetic and jaded and helpless.
[00:33:29.992 --> 00:33:34.897]  Helplessness is essential to control if you're using techniques of terrorism.
[00:33:34.917 --> 00:33:37.820]  Well, the Marines brag about that when they dominate a population.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.882]  They want to teach them to learn helplessness.
[00:33:40.302 --> 00:33:40.623]  I don't know.
[00:33:55.499 --> 00:34:21.246]  Uh, as the Club of Rome wrote in 91 and republished last year in the Council on Foreign Relations with their chairman Richard N. Haas, who wrote it back in the early 90s, that they will use the pincer of false environmentalism to teach us we're bad and that we're the enemy and the state's going to deal with us, because we're bad for the earth, and the other pincer of fake terrorism, with those two pincers, the left is into the environment pincer, the right is into the law and order pincer, with those pincers, they've got us.
[00:34:22.867 --> 00:34:26.780]  And what they're doing across the world right now is another idea they dreamed up.
[00:34:27.492 --> 00:34:44.825]  It was called, and they actually have a group in the United States who are well-funded to do so, and it's called Revolutionary Democracy, where they go across the world forcing countries, by literally bombing them out of existence if necessary, to accept this new idea of democracy.
[00:34:45.285 --> 00:34:56.373]  So they're standardizing the entire planet according to this agenda, and anyone who won't go along with it is simply to be obliterated, and that's what they're doing in the Middle East right now, and in Afghanistan too.
[00:34:58.562 --> 00:34:59.103]  Absolutely.
[00:34:59.143 --> 00:35:03.409]  I want to go to some phone calls, Alan, but there's a lot of other things going on in the world today.
[00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:06.813]  You know, the bad news is it's very serious what's happening.
[00:35:06.833 --> 00:35:08.996]  The good news is we don't have a choice.
[00:35:09.837 --> 00:35:10.939]  We have to resist this.
[00:35:10.979 --> 00:35:13.242]  We have to say no to this system.
[00:35:13.262 --> 00:35:15.585]  I mean, are you not pleasantly pleased?
[00:35:16.286 --> 00:35:19.068]  Because I know I'm certainly seeing an explosive awakening.
[00:35:19.408 --> 00:35:23.451]  This information you and I and others are putting out is the hottest info out there right now.
[00:35:23.852 --> 00:35:25.633]  And it's not some fad, it's reality.
[00:35:25.673 --> 00:35:31.057]  It's people rediscovering reality and learning they're being bombarded by propaganda at every angle.
[00:35:31.097 --> 00:35:41.265]  I mean, I'm optimistic as dark as things are because I also know people in the elite structure themselves are becoming upset with what's happening and seeing their plan come to fruition.
[00:35:41.285 --> 00:35:45.047]  A lot of them are two or three generation and, you know,
[00:35:46.388 --> 00:35:49.870]  It's alerting to them to want to come over to the light side.
[00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:52.771]  It's very lonely for them and some of them aren't psychopaths.
[00:35:52.791 --> 00:35:58.513]  They've been brought along to the system and tried to be trained and conditioned to enjoy predatory action against their own species.
[00:35:58.553 --> 00:36:01.655]  But I see rebellion and resistance in every quarter.
[00:36:02.515 --> 00:36:05.737]  Yes, and it will have to increase and escalate as well.
[00:36:06.177 --> 00:36:07.477]  And there will be martyrs.
[00:36:07.517 --> 00:36:11.299]  There's always martyrs and you need martyrs as well to get the public on board.
[00:36:12.202 --> 00:36:17.568]  And that will grow and grow, and that's what they're terrified of, in fact, is the creation of martyrs.
[00:36:18.308 --> 00:36:23.434]  That's the greatest way to get the public turning against the tyrants in all ages.
[00:36:24.014 --> 00:36:25.376]  So they're very, very careful at the moment.
[00:36:25.396 --> 00:36:33.484]  That's why the feds bomb themselves in Oklahoma City and bomb themselves on 9-11, because they get to become the martyrs.
[00:36:33.584 --> 00:36:33.764]  Yes.
[00:36:33.804 --> 00:36:36.545]  And they're also saying that anyone, literally, who is politically incorrect on any topic
[00:36:58.433 --> 00:37:02.579]  That they mandate as wholly today as therefore also a terrorism.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:07.988]  Terrorist has been expanded to include everyone who is against any part of the agenda.
[00:37:08.362 --> 00:37:18.168]  I had a top lawyer on just a few weeks ago, who was quoted in the LA Times, you know, this big risk management lawyer out of New York, and he admitted my analysis of Section 802 was accurate in the Patriot Act.
[00:37:18.469 --> 00:37:29.976]  He said, talking to an officer, just responding, or asking a question, is an act of terrorism under the Patriot Act, and is being used in thousands of cases per state, per year.
[00:37:31.297 --> 00:37:31.737]  Absolutely.
[00:37:31.757 --> 00:37:36.120]  And make note, too, that they're passing all these various omnibus bills, and
[00:37:36.883 --> 00:37:50.349]  They're 1,000, 2,000, 10,000 pages long, no one reads them, and all of these laws get put into action, and then we're all bewildered where they all came from, and why no politician ever debated them.
[00:37:50.749 --> 00:38:00.593]  I mean, I don't even know what the politicians are there for, because they're like trained seals to clap their fins when the big man speaks at the top, because they certainly don't do anything for the public.
[00:38:00.834 --> 00:38:04.795]  Because again, I think they're fantastic.
[00:38:05.516 --> 00:38:05.856]  That's it.
[00:38:06.276 --> 00:38:06.416]  Yeah.
[00:38:07.475 --> 00:38:16.398]  Yep, they clap for the boss man, and the boss man, it's like when Bush said to them, don't read this Patriot Act bill, because you'll be, it'd be unpatriotic to do so.
[00:38:16.818 --> 00:38:24.120]  Well, notice Obama said that he was going to stop bills not being read, and would pressure Congress to give five days for it to be read.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:30.722]  Then, he was instrumental in the first bailout as a senator, not having it read, saying we have to have it or it'll be a depression on Monday morning.
[00:38:30.983 --> 00:38:31.903]  And then when they passed it,
[00:38:32.503 --> 00:38:47.792]  It wasn't what they said it was, and then now, this week, last week, with the federalization bill, really called the stimulus package, he said it's got to be passed, no one can read it, they weren't allowed to read it, it passed, and he said, I'm going on vacation for four days, I'll sign it later.
[00:38:48.052 --> 00:38:49.093]  Talk about gangster!
[00:38:49.933 --> 00:38:54.556]  I mean, just like, you idiots, you didn't get a chance to read it now, you took my bait.
[00:38:55.617 --> 00:38:55.817]  I know.
[00:38:56.457 --> 00:38:59.319]  And once again, the public are overruled and everything.
[00:38:59.339 --> 00:39:00.300]  There's no input.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.101]  There's no inquiry.
[00:39:02.762 --> 00:39:07.485]  I don't think the machinery to even set up an inquiry is there as to why they keep passing these bills without reading them.
[00:39:08.446 --> 00:39:15.271]  But they've snuck in so much into the last omnibus bill that they put through, including the tracking and tracing of everybody in the U.S.
[00:39:15.671 --> 00:39:17.833]  Psychological records for gun control, yeah.
[00:39:17.853 --> 00:39:22.316]  Psychological and also to do with your health records and your DNA and everything else.
[00:39:22.396 --> 00:39:23.477]  And then notice...
[00:39:23.737 --> 00:39:42.615]  Notice in Canada and in Austin, Texas and all over there suddenly announcing all over the world on the same day, oh we've been finding people not guilty who were in prison because of DNA and the police chiefs come out and say we need to take everybody's DNA every time they're given a misdemeanor because it'll save people.
[00:39:42.655 --> 00:39:48.380]  They don't tell you police have been caught thousands of times using DNA samples to plant them on people.
[00:39:48.641 --> 00:39:48.781]  Yes.
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:49.740]  Yes.
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:51.180]  That's the easiest thing to do.
[00:39:51.521 --> 00:39:55.282]  Corruption is all... You see, deception is the way that governments have always operated.
[00:39:55.342 --> 00:39:56.982]  It's always by deception.
[00:39:57.402 --> 00:40:00.023]  There's nothing they can... They will tell you that you didn't take his truth.
[00:40:00.463 --> 00:40:02.184]  Unfortunately, that's the way it really is.
[00:40:02.224 --> 00:40:04.264]  That's the hard reality of life.
[00:40:04.344 --> 00:40:05.925]  It's... They're born liars.
[00:40:06.005 --> 00:40:10.706]  Hey, why do you think the Austin police chief's trying to cozy up to us while he's pushing all of this?
[00:40:12.663 --> 00:40:15.166]  I don't know what his particular event will be.
[00:40:15.366 --> 00:40:21.673]  I think it might end up like O'Brien when I'm in the prison cell and the door opens and he walks in and I go, they got you too?
[00:40:21.693 --> 00:40:23.835]  And he goes, yeah, they got me a long time ago.
[00:40:24.436 --> 00:40:24.937]  That's right.
[00:40:25.477 --> 00:40:25.898]  That's right.
[00:40:26.498 --> 00:40:26.959]  And they do.
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.983]  These people do belong, unfortunately, to associations.
[00:40:32.124 --> 00:40:35.047]  Uh, again, there's all the brotherhood methods, etc.
[00:40:35.087 --> 00:40:38.449]  They're all fraternity members and they do stand up for each other.
[00:40:38.469 --> 00:40:42.453]  They do know how to keep secrets because it helps them on their career.
[00:40:43.053 --> 00:40:52.621]  So we have a lot of this corruption too, to be, uh, you cannot have a free society when you have fraternities or foundations with their own secret mandates.
[00:40:54.423 --> 00:40:54.983]  No, you can't.
[00:40:55.003 --> 00:40:56.544]  They always overthrow the society.
[00:40:56.665 --> 00:40:59.146]  Let's go to the calls here for Ellen Watt.
[00:40:59.566 --> 00:41:00.927]  Cut into TheMatrix.com.
[00:41:01.588 --> 00:41:02.969]  Robin in Ohio.
[00:41:03.009 --> 00:41:03.709]  You're on the air.
[00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:05.130]  Hello?
[00:41:05.691 --> 00:41:06.251]  Yes, Robin.
[00:41:06.911 --> 00:41:08.092]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:41:08.152 --> 00:41:09.833]  It's nice to talk to you.
[00:41:09.873 --> 00:41:14.056]  Hey, you guys are all across the board, and I'm totally with you.
[00:41:14.997 --> 00:41:19.360]  It's just amazing, Alex.
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.361]  I sent you a gift, a t-shirt.
[00:41:21.741 --> 00:41:24.183]  With my license plate, World Trade Center 7 on it.
[00:41:24.423 --> 00:41:26.184]  But I push you every day.
[00:41:27.365 --> 00:41:28.565]  Push your documentaries.
[00:41:28.906 --> 00:41:29.706]  I do everything.
[00:41:29.766 --> 00:41:31.227]  I engage people every day.
[00:41:31.908 --> 00:41:35.430]  And you're a real strong inspiration.
[00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:38.752]  But I wanted to share one thing, and I'll get off the horn.
[00:41:40.093 --> 00:41:41.574]  Golf War Illness is real.
[00:41:41.634 --> 00:41:44.936]  It's a November 18th article from McClatchy.
[00:41:46.812 --> 00:41:57.378]  A lot of us already knew about the pyrobromide stigmite tablets that we had to take when we were over in Iraq, but never realized they sprayed us with pesticides.
[00:41:58.049 --> 00:41:58.529]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:41:58.549 --> 00:42:04.235]  They sprayed a cyanide-based pesticide in the tanks and in the barracks, knowing what it would do.
[00:42:04.315 --> 00:42:09.139]  See, with globalists in their own documents, and Alan can speak to this, don't like the military.
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:15.986]  And so after they're done using you, they're going to psychologically not let them own guns, that's now being announced, phasing that in.
[00:42:16.867 --> 00:42:21.251]  They give the inoculations that are soft kill, that are designed to kill the troops within 20 to 25 years.
[00:42:22.652 --> 00:42:31.797]  They have them around the D.U., which their own admissions say is going to kill anybody that breathes it, just from the particulate size and poison level alone.
[00:42:32.317 --> 00:42:37.960]  And so absolutely, they're now admitting they're going to take the pensions of World War II, Korean War, and Vietnam vets.
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.601]  And so, trashing the troops.
[00:42:41.021 --> 00:42:43.843]  They also blew up the Camasilla chemical weapons dump.
[00:42:44.503 --> 00:42:46.884]  And, you know, the troops have nerve damage from that.
[00:42:47.004 --> 00:42:48.305]  Antibiotic weapon was released.
[00:42:48.325 --> 00:42:49.346]  We're not sure by who.
[00:42:49.706 --> 00:42:51.587]  The microplasm incognitus.
[00:42:52.267 --> 00:42:58.248]  Those little microplasms that live inside bacteria, and they were carrying a HIV-like autoimmune system.
[00:42:58.268 --> 00:43:00.969]  MD Anderson confirmed this within them.
[00:43:01.409 --> 00:43:07.770]  Strangely enough, my dad, when he was at UT in advanced programs, they were teaching him then about microplasms as bio-weapons.
[00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:08.230]  Stay with us.
[00:43:09.831 --> 00:43:13.272]  In these uncertain times, safety and precaution are key.
[00:43:13.792 --> 00:43:15.372]  Don't rely on others for protection.
[00:43:15.802 --> 00:43:19.143]  Protect yourself and your family with products from Pepperspray.com.
[00:43:19.403 --> 00:43:24.504]  Pepperspray.com carries the largest assortment of pepper spray and personal safety devices on the web.

[00:43:28.505 --> 00:43:38.647]  Order the Discreet Pepper Mace Baton, which relies on a powerful pepper formula that upon direct contact with an attacker's eyes, forces them to slam shut, causing an intense burning sensation.
[00:43:39.067 --> 00:43:41.868]  This refillable unit is designed to be carried as a key ring.
[00:43:42.188 --> 00:43:43.068]  Easily accessible
[00:43:43.268 --> 00:43:43.889]  We're good to go.
[00:44:08.081 --> 00:44:10.103]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:44:10.243 --> 00:44:12.645]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:44:12.665 --> 00:44:15.267]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:44:15.287 --> 00:44:16.448]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:44:16.468 --> 00:44:18.109]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:44:18.189 --> 00:44:21.031]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:44:21.071 --> 00:44:24.714]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:44:34.351 --> 00:44:39.244]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:44:43.032 --> 00:44:44.073]  How dare you?
[00:44:44.513 --> 00:44:50.538]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:44:50.698 --> 00:44:53.341]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:44:53.441 --> 00:44:59.846]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:07.532]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:45:09.334 --> 00:45:11.956]  What will happen when the grocery stores are empty?
[00:45:12.475 --> 00:45:14.776]  What are you going to do once your food is gone?
[00:45:15.396 --> 00:45:19.238]  What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?
[00:45:19.658 --> 00:45:24.620]  Growing your own food is the only way to have real self-sufficiency and peace of mind.
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:32.883]  GetSeeds.net is offering an amazing special on 100 different varieties of heirloom vegetable seeds with a complete range of crops.

[00:46:21.159 --> 00:46:25.043]  Yeah, I mean, look at the statistics.
[00:46:25.083 --> 00:46:38.114]  Gulf War I vets are hundreds of times more likely to die of cancer and all sorts of other horrible ailments.
[00:46:46.963 --> 00:46:51.426]  For over a decade, major universities and scientific institutions have done autopsies on them.
[00:46:52.747 --> 00:46:55.129]  The Marines, the Army forces, will shrivel up.
[00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:59.493]  They'll be in wheelchairs and they'll tell them, you're not sick, you're Prozac, you're mentally ill.
[00:47:01.554 --> 00:47:05.257]  Then they put them on databases so they can't buy firearms, even though there's no law to do that.
[00:47:05.737 --> 00:47:07.559]  They just go to do the instant check and can't get them.
[00:47:07.579 --> 00:47:08.900]  And then they die.
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.381]  They go in coffins, they go in the ground.
[00:47:11.142 --> 00:47:12.042]  Mission accomplished.
[00:47:12.082 --> 00:47:13.543]  Get rid of the troops after you've used them.
[00:47:14.711 --> 00:47:24.733]  And, uh, just like the police and military and the rescue workers on 9-11, their lungs full of asbestos, uh, major, you know, institutions did the CAT scans, it's there, they're dying.
[00:47:25.313 --> 00:47:28.434]  I mean, I've interviewed these policing people and you'll try to call them a month later and they're dead.
[00:47:28.974 --> 00:47:29.674]  And we'll have them on.
[00:47:29.714 --> 00:47:34.435]  People that are in Truth Rising, a bunch of them that you see at that press conference at the Capitol trying to get funding, they're dead.
[00:47:35.256 --> 00:47:37.096]  Government says, hey, there was no dust, not bad for you.
[00:47:37.356 --> 00:47:38.176]  You're not going to get treatment.
[00:47:39.016 --> 00:47:41.517]  Um, this is done scientifically, isn't it, Allen?
[00:47:42.722 --> 00:48:00.887]  Yes, because after the Vietnam War, in fact during it, the government did surveys into the aftermath of the war, especially with the protests back home, they were afraid that young people who were very fit, well-trained in military strategy could get formed within civilian life, within civilian street.
[00:48:01.527 --> 00:48:01.827]  I think?
[00:48:19.867 --> 00:48:20.387]  I don't think so.
[00:48:42.874 --> 00:48:47.075]  And the sergeants would actually inspect their mouths to make sure they swallowed them.
[00:48:47.415 --> 00:48:51.176]  So there's a lot of experimentation going on as well within the military.
[00:48:51.197 --> 00:48:53.477]  They don't even know what pills they're taking or what they're for.
[00:48:53.617 --> 00:48:54.718]  It's experiments for sure.
[00:48:54.918 --> 00:48:57.658]  And now we have evidence they're giving the police the soft kill weapons.
[00:48:58.279 --> 00:48:59.119]  Don't laugh, police.
[00:48:59.139 --> 00:49:01.219]  You better investigate this if you care about your own life.
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.941]  Does that go along the lines of what you were bringing up, Robin?
[00:49:05.241 --> 00:49:06.221]  What happened to you in the Gulf War?
[00:49:07.061 --> 00:49:07.822]  Well, yes, sir.
[00:49:07.942 --> 00:49:31.322]  Actually, what happened to myself, my platoon leader's wife worked at the hospital in Clarksville, Tennessee, home of the 101st Airborne Division, and over a sat phone, she called him and said, whatever you do, do not take those because they've never been approved by the FDA at that point.
[00:49:32.183 --> 00:49:36.764]  And the only military in the world that actually took those was the Israeli military.
[00:49:37.864 --> 00:49:43.206]  And so I pretty much ceased and desisted after five, uh, five tablets.
[00:49:44.106 --> 00:49:45.046]  So I was done.
[00:49:45.506 --> 00:49:57.789]  So, but the Camasea thing, the 101st Airborne, uh, it was a guy in my squad that called the entire division, Michael Williams, Brooklyn, New York, uh, to mop level four.
[00:49:58.325 --> 00:50:03.207]  Because his M8 detector went off, and then 14 minutes later they said, uh, stand down.
[00:50:03.227 --> 00:50:08.550]  That's right, they blew up the chemical weapons dump and then told people, stand down, take your mask off.
[00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.810]  Yes, sir.
[00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:19.635]  That actually occurred, and I had a conversation with David Von Kleist of ThePowerHour.com, and he said, you know what was odd, Robin?
[00:50:21.875 --> 00:50:26.078]  14,000 detectors, according to the Army Times, just malfunctioned that day.
[00:50:26.098 --> 00:50:29.641]  That's right, the Army Times reported 14,000 detectors malfunctioned.
[00:50:30.062 --> 00:50:32.784]  Nerve gas hit them, and a nice soft kill.
[00:50:32.804 --> 00:50:35.166]  A lot of them are dead or in wheelchairs.
[00:50:35.546 --> 00:50:36.787]  Sorry to hear that happen to you.
[00:50:36.827 --> 00:50:37.288]  Take care.
[00:50:37.308 --> 00:50:38.569]  Appreciate you.
[00:50:38.589 --> 00:50:40.791]  Just remember who did it to you, the New World Order eugenicist.
[00:50:41.231 --> 00:50:43.733]  Alan Watt, do five more minutes with us and take some final calls.
[00:50:44.014 --> 00:50:45.235]  Then Bob Dacey in studio.
[00:50:50.157 --> 00:50:51.718]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:50:58.062 --> 00:50:58.642]  Hello, friends.
[00:50:58.682 --> 00:50:59.643]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:50:59.743 --> 00:51:04.366]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:51:04.486 --> 00:51:07.248]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:51:07.468 --> 00:51:10.330]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:15.233]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:15.433 --> 00:51:16.354]  If you simply prepare.
[00:51:16.574 --> 00:51:19.496]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:19.816 --> 00:51:26.700]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.922]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:51:47.239 --> 00:51:49.061]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:52:00.791 --> 00:52:02.711]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:52:03.191 --> 00:52:06.052]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:12.433 --> 00:52:13.073]  Big Brother.
[00:52:13.733 --> 00:52:14.793]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:15.514 --> 00:52:16.614]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:17.274 --> 00:52:18.074]  You want answers?
[00:52:18.834 --> 00:52:19.794]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:20.394 --> 00:52:24.075]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:24.595 --> 00:52:28.656]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:35.222 --> 00:52:38.463]  Final segment with Alan Watt cutting through the Matrix.com.
[00:52:38.503 --> 00:52:46.865]  Don't forget, you can pre-order The Obama Deception at TheObamaDeception.net or by linking through at PresentPlanet.com and Infowars.com on the banners on the main page.
[00:52:47.246 --> 00:52:52.067]  The film will ship out coming up on the 15th of March.
[00:52:52.867 --> 00:52:55.468]  And he is their front man to carry through their New World Order.
[00:52:55.788 --> 00:52:58.549]  We need to expose Obama as a treacherous hoax.
[00:52:59.189 --> 00:53:01.670]  Hey Alex, I'm just really excited to be on your show right now.
[00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:03.771]  I've been trying to get in for like three days.
[00:53:23.635 --> 00:53:27.500]  I actually wanted to hit a few points, and I just wanted to talk about double-think today.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:30.343]  I think that's a big friggin' issue.
[00:53:30.663 --> 00:53:34.608]  A reason why people don't want to listen to you when you say the truth.
[00:53:35.149 --> 00:53:36.510]  It's a big issue.
[00:53:37.571 --> 00:53:43.839]  I used to listen to your show, but then I kind of stopped, and I've just been picking up now that Barack Obama's in office, because I know
[00:53:44.403 --> 00:53:47.125]  I'm a black man myself, and I know that this is just dangerous.
[00:53:47.145 --> 00:53:52.570]  This is dangerous psych warfare on not only the black community, just America and the world in general.
[00:53:52.931 --> 00:53:53.951]  So I just wanted to talk about it.
[00:53:56.033 --> 00:54:02.799]  I watched three things on television the other day, and I don't watch television that much, so this just stuck out to me.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:10.126]  I don't know if you've seen it, but eAssurance.com, the insurance company, they have a commercial out talking about Earth Hour.
[00:54:10.286 --> 00:54:11.527]  I don't know if you know about that.
[00:54:11.977 --> 00:54:15.800]  But they want people to turn off all their lights for one hour all around the world.
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:27.369]  So it's just one of those, you know... Yeah, and it came out that Enron would do that in California, saying there was no power to create the perception of artificial scarcity so that people would accept higher prices.
[00:54:27.409 --> 00:54:30.432]  It's all about training us to have less resources.
[00:54:30.532 --> 00:54:31.733]  Alan Watt, can you speak to that?
[00:54:32.817 --> 00:54:37.583]  Yes, they want to cut us back drastically from our present power consumption, and not all energy in fact.
[00:54:38.104 --> 00:54:44.993]  And it goes in with Agenda 21 of the United Nations, where they want us all living in compact cities, really overcrowded cities.
[00:54:45.752 --> 00:54:45.912]  I think?
[00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:19.760]  And they say they've got to have their phony environmental takeover because they want to actually control new energy so they can suppress the really good new clean industries and that no one will suspect them of that because they're, quote, the people that want the clean new industries.
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:20.621]  It's all on record, Alan.
[00:55:21.141 --> 00:55:30.350]  It's on record and Maurice Strong, who has been up at the head of the World Bank and a whole bunch of hats he wears at the UN, came over to Ontario, Canada in the 80s.
[00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:34.794]  He set up the infrastructure to privatize Ontario Hydro, this electric company.
[00:55:35.399 --> 00:55:47.663]  And he said at the time that in the future there'll be very little private electricity use for the general people, and he set up the infrastructure to set up big generators to keep the plants and factories and offices going.
[00:55:48.063 --> 00:55:52.525]  The general population were to live at the very basic minimum level of power.
[00:55:53.005 --> 00:55:54.125]  And that was back in the 80s.
[00:55:54.225 --> 00:55:56.486]  And he, of course, is Mr. Rockefeller's front man.
[00:55:56.906 --> 00:56:02.072]  Because of your feudal serf and totally poor, that is a mode of control.
[00:56:02.092 --> 00:56:06.738]  I mean, Mexico has triple the resources we have, and they have more billionaires per capita than any nation.
[00:56:07.059 --> 00:56:08.200]  That's done by design.
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:10.943]  This is neo-serfdom and feudalism.
[00:56:11.284 --> 00:56:14.247]  I appreciate your call, Solomon Dale, Matt, Glenn and others, and Drew.
[00:56:14.588 --> 00:56:16.390]  You'll have a chance to talk with myself and Bob Dacey.
[00:56:16.690 --> 00:56:19.772]  I want to get you back up for a full two hours in the next few weeks, Alan Watt.
[00:56:20.032 --> 00:56:23.095]  Hope folks will go check out your website, CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com.
[00:56:23.335 --> 00:56:28.518]  We really appreciate your just amazing analysis and your research, and Godspeed.
[00:56:29.059 --> 00:56:30.220]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[00:56:30.885 --> 00:56:31.466]  You bet, folks.
[00:56:31.506 --> 00:56:33.267]  Be sure and check out ComingToTheMatrix.com.
[00:56:33.347 --> 00:56:37.330]  And I've done two hours and five minutes, and I've really just started plugging.

[00:58:09.286 --> 00:58:12.708]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:58:12.888 --> 00:58:14.750]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:18.093]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:58:18.393 --> 00:58:23.877]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:58:24.137 --> 00:58:27.500]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet

[00:59:05.442 --> 00:59:06.162]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:59:07.421 --> 00:59:13.085]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:59:13.365 --> 00:59:18.129]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:59:18.149 --> 00:59:23.352]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[00:59:23.572 --> 00:59:27.015]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[00:59:27.495 --> 00:59:35.659]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.982]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[00:59:41.803 --> 00:59:47.546]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:59:47.786 --> 00:59:50.107]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[00:59:50.387 --> 00:59:52.808]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[01:00:06.275 --> 01:00:11.277]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:00:11.818 --> 01:00:14.639]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:21.676 --> 01:00:31.202]  Well, for the next 50 minutes, maybe longer, we'll have him ride shotgun and he's got time when Mike Romero is joining us via video cam, coming up in 52 minutes at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:31.242 --> 01:00:33.844]  He'll be joining us as well.
[01:00:35.045 --> 01:00:39.668]  I wanted to have Bob Dacey here in studio today, because we always enjoy having Bob here.
[01:00:39.688 --> 01:00:41.329]  He also sits in sometimes when I'm out of town.
[01:00:41.629 --> 01:00:44.892]  Plus, we have the Independent Film Channel here and an Australian TV crew.
[01:00:45.952 --> 01:00:50.614]  As well is about to arrive, so why not just intensify the level of the circus?
[01:00:51.354 --> 01:00:58.216]  Bob, I wanted to get you here today to mainly not just talk about media, mainstream media lies, or how mainstream media is bought and paid for by global corporations that have an agenda.
[01:00:58.656 --> 01:01:08.760]  I wanted to get into how they're trying to regulate and shut down the Internet with Internet 2, how the mainstream media is really desperately trying right now.
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.763]  To restrict the web, and if you think they'll be successful in that.
[01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:24.111]  But just out of the gates, Barack Obama, he's been in office now right at a month, and in fact it'll be a month tomorrow since he got in in January.
[01:01:24.691 --> 01:01:25.872]  20th now, it's now February.
[01:01:28.934 --> 01:01:39.528]  Nineteenth, where you see that going, and if you see the Obamanoids, the Bushoids, it took them a while to wake up to the fact that he was a globalist and a front man and running nothing.
[01:01:39.949 --> 01:01:46.197]  Will the Obamanoids, now that he has betrayed everything he said he would do, are they going to wake up?
[01:01:46.824 --> 01:01:47.885]  Alex, thank you for having me on.
[01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:50.047]  I appreciate being able to come down here again.
[01:01:50.227 --> 01:01:53.751]  As far as Obama is concerned, you know, the thing about him, he hit the ground running.
[01:01:54.351 --> 01:02:01.018]  You know, he was brought up in the Brzezinski Rockefeller School.
[01:02:01.058 --> 01:02:02.359]  He's their boy.
[01:02:02.379 --> 01:02:04.882]  I hate to use the word boy, but he is their boy.
[01:02:07.183 --> 01:02:10.025]  He's kind of like Bill Clinton without the sexual baggage.
[01:02:10.085 --> 01:02:11.345]  He was definitely their boy.
[01:02:11.365 --> 01:02:16.068]  All of these presidents since Kennedy are their minions.
[01:02:16.208 --> 01:02:20.410]  He's taken the used car salesman to a new level, actually.
[01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:21.891]  He's so slick.
[01:02:22.031 --> 01:02:23.652]  He's slicker than Slick Willie ever was.
[01:02:24.252 --> 01:02:28.393]  Because he doesn't have all that baggage from being the governor of Arkansas.
[01:02:28.513 --> 01:02:28.793]  You know?
[01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:31.633]  All the ladies and all that other stuff.
[01:02:31.693 --> 01:02:37.154]  So, he's hit the ground running and he's done everything that we've said he was going to do.
[01:02:37.554 --> 01:02:39.155]  He's just streaming lies.
[01:02:39.295 --> 01:02:41.555]  Everything coming out of his mouth is a lie.
[01:02:42.135 --> 01:02:44.796]  And he's betraying all the things he said during the campaign.
[01:02:45.416 --> 01:02:46.556]  And, I mean, why not?
[01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:47.536]  We knew that was going to happen.
[01:02:47.596 --> 01:02:48.456]  It's just a con job.
[01:02:48.576 --> 01:02:49.276]  We've known it.
[01:02:49.336 --> 01:02:50.917]  It's part of the agenda for years.
[01:02:51.797 --> 01:02:53.037]  You know, Carol Quigley's book.
[01:02:53.795 --> 01:02:54.716]  Uh, tragedy and hope.
[01:02:54.876 --> 01:02:55.637]  He spells it out.
[01:02:55.677 --> 01:02:58.579]  He says, you can throw the bums out every four years if you want to.
[01:02:58.639 --> 01:02:59.119]  We don't care.
[01:02:59.159 --> 01:03:02.401]  We got control of both sides and you won't affect any change at all.
[01:03:02.962 --> 01:03:05.244]  You know, so yeah, uh, good luck everybody.
[01:03:05.284 --> 01:03:07.345]  I mean, just, are they gonna wake up?
[01:03:07.906 --> 01:03:10.347]  Well, if they buy the Obama deception, they probably will.
[01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:10.708]  You know?
[01:03:11.408 --> 01:03:12.369]  Get that going.
[01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:13.289]  They won't have to buy it.
[01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:15.111]  It'll be all over the web, but absolutely.
[01:03:15.891 --> 01:03:18.013]  Bob, let's go through from your perspective.
[01:03:18.033 --> 01:03:19.033]  He lied about lobbyists.
[01:03:19.053 --> 01:03:20.835]  That's all he seems to be appointing is lobbyists.
[01:03:21.195 --> 01:03:22.356]  He lied about appointing donors.
[01:03:22.376 --> 01:03:23.997]  That's the other half he's appointing.
[01:03:24.417 --> 01:03:26.078]  He lied about ending the war.
[01:03:26.118 --> 01:03:29.921]  First it was instantly, then six months, then 16 months, then 21 months.
[01:03:30.681 --> 01:03:32.803]  He's increasing the troops massively in Afghanistan.
[01:03:33.663 --> 01:03:39.848]  He lied about waiting five days for a bill to be read before it should be passed.
[01:03:39.868 --> 01:03:42.810]  Then he said, don't read it, you've got to pass the stimulus now.
[01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:45.852]  He has literally lied about everything.
[01:03:45.872 --> 01:03:53.157]  He said he's shutting down Guantanamo, but it really says they're going to look at shutting it, but keep other camps open and continue the practice of rendition or kidnapping.
[01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:54.338]  You forgot one of the other lies.
[01:03:54.418 --> 01:03:58.901]  I mean, he lied about his intentions in regard to the Second Amendment and gun control.
[01:03:59.421 --> 01:04:03.285]  Over and over during the campaign he said, oh you people don't have anything to worry about for me.
[01:04:03.825 --> 01:04:04.345]  Well guess what?
[01:04:04.366 --> 01:04:06.047]  You're going to find out that was wrong too.
[01:04:06.287 --> 01:04:10.150]  Because his Attorney General Holder argued before the Supreme Court last year in the D.C.
[01:04:10.191 --> 01:04:13.694]  gun ban that no citizen should be allowed to own any firearm.
[01:04:13.954 --> 01:04:19.799]  He is for complete and total abolition of citizens' right to defense.
[01:04:20.179 --> 01:04:21.500]  And then it just expands.
[01:04:22.061 --> 01:04:23.422]  He said he was against NAFTA and GATT.
[01:04:23.642 --> 01:04:25.163]  Now he says that was just campaign rhetoric.
[01:04:25.264 --> 01:04:26.945]  I mean the lies are legion.
[01:04:27.005 --> 01:04:39.488]  Holder said in his amicus brief to the Supreme Court in the Heller case that he did not see in the Constitution a right, an individual right, to keep and bear an arm in your own home.
[01:04:40.228 --> 01:04:48.330]  So I would have to ask the Attorney General of the United States if he believes that you don't have the right to keep and bear arms in your own home, then where exactly
[01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:52.211]  Geographically, would you have a right to keep and bear them?
[01:04:52.431 --> 01:04:54.071]  And I think we know the answer to that question.
[01:04:54.091 --> 01:04:56.832]  Well, he's got firearms, he's got bodyguards.
[01:04:57.192 --> 01:04:58.732]  He's better than you, Alex.
[01:04:58.812 --> 01:05:02.493]  It's come out that Sarah Brady, who wants to disarm us, she's got bodyguards.
[01:05:02.873 --> 01:05:06.934]  Yeah, I think one of her kids got a gun surreptitiously through her one time a few years ago.
[01:05:06.954 --> 01:05:08.315]  It was quite embarrassing, you know?
[01:05:08.835 --> 01:05:09.895]  Didn't go through incident check.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.602]  You know, I mean, the whole thing is a farce, Alex.
[01:05:14.382 --> 01:05:15.823]  Well, it's like the politicians.
[01:05:17.064 --> 01:05:20.726]  It's come out in the news, the majority of Congress doesn't pay income taxes.
[01:05:21.026 --> 01:05:24.548]  He keeps having to get rid of his appointees because they don't pay taxes.
[01:05:25.188 --> 01:05:28.811]  The guy running the Treasury, Geithner, doesn't pay his taxes.
[01:05:29.111 --> 01:05:30.051]  But that's okay.
[01:05:30.091 --> 01:05:33.693]  So tell me how that isn't the pinnacle of hypocrisy.
[01:05:34.634 --> 01:05:37.175]  Geithner is supposed to run the Treasury Department.
[01:05:37.195 --> 01:05:39.116]  The Treasury Department sits on top of the IRS.
[01:05:40.197 --> 01:05:41.917]  His deal is like, who cares?
[01:05:42.378 --> 01:05:46.979]  But some of the other so-called appointees, they forgot a few things, and oh, they can't serve office.
[01:05:47.199 --> 01:05:50.660]  But the guy who's going to run the IRS, it's okay that he doesn't pay his taxes.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:06:02.383]  And he's one of the guys in the 90s, along with Summers and Greenspan and all of them, that changed the Glass-Steagall Act and others, so the banks could set up these Ponzi schemes with derivatives and these financial instruments.
[01:06:03.283 --> 01:06:06.784]  Yeah, it's basically, Alex, what we're talking about is a bunch of arch-criminals.
[01:06:06.904 --> 01:06:08.205]  I've got another Obama lie.
[01:06:08.225 --> 01:06:09.265]  I've got one of the bigger ones.
[01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.731]  He said that...
[01:06:13.908 --> 01:06:20.991]  He was putting caps on CEO salaries, which is actually bad enough because it's socialism and fascism in control, but he doesn't doing that.
[01:06:21.291 --> 01:06:29.594]  Even mainstream media had to admit all the major banks and brokerage firms were exempt, and smaller firms in the future, it would be on the honor system.
[01:06:29.614 --> 01:06:33.615]  So he gets up and says, hey, this is a quote, this is outrageous, these people.
[01:06:33.655 --> 01:06:41.538]  We like to reward success in this country, but rewarding failure with these $100 billion bonuses and things, it's wrong, and hey, we're putting an end to it.
[01:06:41.718 --> 01:06:44.581]  And then you read the executive order and it says that it's not going to do anything!
[01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:47.283]  I mean, this is... I have to tell you, you're right.
[01:06:47.743 --> 01:06:49.565]  He is worse than Slick Willie.
[01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:50.966]  He is worse than George Bush.
[01:06:51.306 --> 01:06:56.131]  I mean, he has taken arrogant, 100% lying, hugging old ladies.
[01:06:56.151 --> 01:06:57.172]  Oh, I'm going to help you, ma'am.
[01:06:57.192 --> 01:06:57.632]  Don't worry.
[01:06:57.712 --> 01:07:00.935]  I'm going to... I mean, and he knows he's slitting their throat politically.
[01:07:01.315 --> 01:07:01.896]  Absolutely.
[01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:05.218]  The guy is a walking, talking, lying machine.
[01:07:05.278 --> 01:07:06.980]  But again, it's the same old thing.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.302]  You keep saying it over and over and over again.
[01:07:09.362 --> 01:07:20.851]  When you change administrations, it's Management Team A being replaced by Management Team B. And then the Republicans who are in power, they go back into the foundations and corporations, and the Democrats that were in the foundations and corporations, they go into government.
[01:07:21.092 --> 01:07:23.634]  And then when the Democrats leave, the Republicans will come back out.
[01:07:23.874 --> 01:07:27.337]  So you've got CFR and Trilateral Commission and Bilderberg Group, Team A.
[01:07:27.757 --> 01:07:33.139]  And Trilateral Commission, CFR, Bilderberg Group, Team B, and they just rotate, and it's a cash machine between them.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:38.162]  Yeah, and Brzezinski, for example, he plays both sides of the issue.
[01:07:38.222 --> 01:07:45.125]  He was McCain's advisor back in 2000, Brzezinski, and he's Obama's advisor last year.
[01:07:45.145 --> 01:07:46.265]  I mean, come on.
[01:07:46.305 --> 01:07:47.026]  The whole thing's a fraud.
[01:07:47.046 --> 01:07:47.526]  And now he's concerned.
[01:07:47.726 --> 01:07:52.468]  He's very concerned about the elite bankers and how there's going to be civil war in America.
[01:07:52.568 --> 01:07:53.869]  Just read Brzezinski.
[01:07:53.889 --> 01:07:56.811]  Anybody who doesn't want to believe this, just read Brzezinski.
[01:07:56.851 --> 01:07:58.492]  The guy is a Marxist.
[01:07:59.052 --> 01:08:00.153]  And he's proud of it.
[01:08:00.193 --> 01:08:03.796]  And then he claims he's anti-communist and wants to blow Russia to kingdom come.
[01:08:03.956 --> 01:08:05.056]  Sure he is.
[01:08:05.437 --> 01:08:07.738]  Again, again, consummate liars.
[01:08:08.198 --> 01:08:08.499]  All of them.
[01:08:09.359 --> 01:08:16.024]  And with the thing, you know, when I first met you, Alex, you know, you were kind of over the top for me because I was a conservative Republican type.
[01:08:16.644 --> 01:08:20.487]  And I always checked out everything you said because, you know, whatever it was, I didn't believe it.
[01:08:20.507 --> 01:08:21.327]  I always had to check it out.
[01:08:21.948 --> 01:08:24.810]  And, you know, the problem was everything you said turned out to be right.
[01:08:25.461 --> 01:08:29.646]  And it finally got through to me that maybe I ought to stop bothering to check out what you say.
[01:08:29.906 --> 01:08:31.188]  No, you should always check out.
[01:08:31.288 --> 01:08:31.869]  I still do.
[01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:33.010]  I still do.
[01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:35.172]  Because you'll find even more of what I'm saying.
[01:08:35.353 --> 01:08:43.082]  But the problem is all of these years, all the stuff you've said, and some of the stuff that you said that was like wild out there, is in our face right now.
[01:08:45.433 --> 01:08:49.798]  It's frightening, and you're saying, you always say, well, I'm not brilliant, I just read their stuff.
[01:08:50.239 --> 01:08:50.940]  And it is true.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.221]  You document your stuff.
[01:08:52.501 --> 01:09:00.130]  You read their documents, you look at the reports, you go to the Army's own deal about the prison camps, and you read about that.
[01:09:01.124 --> 01:09:08.110]  I remember back when I first met you, you were screaming about having to get a driver's license, and how it was a federal program, and it was all illegal.
[01:09:08.190 --> 01:09:11.753]  Federal standardized biometrics for Pentagon control, and now they admit all that.
[01:09:11.833 --> 01:09:17.038]  Yeah, and now they admit all that, and so, you know, what's going on here?
[01:09:17.138 --> 01:09:25.005]  You obviously know what's going on, and of course, your success as a broadcaster, I think mirrors the fact that you've been telling the truth all these years.
[01:09:26.195 --> 01:09:31.339]  Well, there's a lot of COINTELPRO attacks on us, too, and that's why I just ask people to realize there's an agenda.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:39.066]  Judge a tree by its fruits, and we have been very successful at reaching people, and that's how we gauge success, not monetarily, but by how many people we reach.
[01:09:39.406 --> 01:09:43.269]  And we have reached hundreds and hundreds of millions of people, and that's what's exciting.
[01:09:43.289 --> 01:09:46.472]  You know, we have over 120,000 downloads a day just for the free podcast.
[01:09:46.812 --> 01:09:51.256]  We're number one on Shoutcast for Internet Radio Show, not just for music, but talk.
[01:09:52.737 --> 01:10:15.356]  We are reaching more and more people on the AM and FM dial with mom and pop stations that put us on, but what I'm most proud of that I've been able to do, the only reason I'm talking about this is because the TV cameras are here and want me to talk about what we've done, is that so many people, young, old, black, white, you know, in Israel or Saudi Arabia or in Germany or in China or Japan or Mexico or Canada, the U.S.,
[01:10:17.168 --> 01:10:18.889]  They start radio shows.
[01:10:18.909 --> 01:10:20.830]  They make successful films.
[01:10:21.271 --> 01:10:22.752]  They make documentaries.
[01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:24.513]  They run for office.
[01:10:24.533 --> 01:10:26.414]  They defeat criminal legislation.
[01:10:27.035 --> 01:10:29.856]  And they tell me, Alex, it was your show, your films.
[01:10:30.157 --> 01:10:32.378]  I'm talking over 80% of the time, I say, what woke you up?
[01:10:32.418 --> 01:10:33.279]  Or they volunteer it.
[01:10:33.819 --> 01:10:38.842]  And to me, that's a microcosm of what all of this new alternative media is doing.
[01:10:39.183 --> 01:10:43.706]  They are spurring people not to even buy their line of information, because none of us are infallible.
[01:10:44.166 --> 01:10:46.808]  All of us look through rose-colored, you know, darkly.
[01:10:47.528 --> 01:10:54.432]  But, that they are now generating and spawning whole new generations of people, and it's exponential.
[01:10:54.652 --> 01:11:00.595]  And so, to realize the power of the human spirit and the power of taking action, that's what's exciting.
[01:11:00.615 --> 01:11:08.119]  Yeah, because, you know, you woke me up back in 1998, and I was drag kicking and screaming into all this from my conservative Republican slumber that I was in.
[01:11:08.619 --> 01:11:12.081]  And as a result of that, you know, I got this local TV show, The Simple Truth.
[01:11:12.161 --> 01:11:14.682]  I've been on the air for 10 years now, almost.
[01:11:15.243 --> 01:11:22.006]  And now, totally through volunteer efforts, we've got a website, simpletruthonline.net, and they archive our TV shows.
[01:11:22.026 --> 01:11:24.668]  And now you write for the New American Magazine, reaching millions.
[01:11:25.328 --> 01:11:27.349]  I mean, you're having a huge effect.
[01:11:27.469 --> 01:11:29.770]  Yeah, and I'm just a guy who owns a hardware store, you know?
[01:11:30.190 --> 01:11:31.451]  I mean, think about that.
[01:11:31.631 --> 01:11:32.332]  That's another thing.
[01:11:32.352 --> 01:11:38.075]  The elite teach us that we have to only listen to their experts and their people, and that we're all a bunch of idiots.
[01:11:38.115 --> 01:11:42.397]  Instead, it really is the people that, you know, that's where the answer's based.
[01:11:42.777 --> 01:11:46.278]  I want to get into how you think this is going to go with Obama, their front man.
[01:11:46.298 --> 01:11:49.299]  And we need to stress, he's just a pathetic puppet, just like George Bush.
[01:11:49.319 --> 01:11:56.720]  And when they're done with him, they're going to blame their whole agenda on him, pull him out like birdcage liner, and put in a new Republican clean birdcage liner.
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:59.661]  Then the new world order bird's going to destroy that.
[01:11:59.681 --> 01:12:00.721]  They'll put in a new minion.
[01:12:01.001 --> 01:12:09.083]  We've got to quit this groundhog day of over and over and over again buying the same garbage as they put their puppet on the left or right.
[01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:12.427]  Newsflash!
[01:12:12.827 --> 01:12:14.450]  Unemployment is soaring over 10%.
[01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:19.676]  The dollar is plummeting and banks are beginning to close their doors.
[01:12:21.105 --> 01:12:25.027]  Financial experts are saying we are headed for an economic depression.
[01:12:25.067 --> 01:12:29.249]  The world is on the brink of total meltdown.
[01:12:29.709 --> 01:12:35.492]  Unless you expect the government to bail you out, you must be able to grow your own healthy food.
[01:12:36.393 --> 01:12:44.777]  Survivalistseeds.com has just released a brand new heirloom seed pack at a dramatically reduced price.
[01:12:45.037 --> 01:12:48.879]  So you and your family have a long-term food solution.
[01:12:50.339 --> 01:12:54.000]  The choice between starvation and freedom is made by you.
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.240]  Right now.
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.641]  Go to survivalistseeds.com.
[01:12:57.801 --> 01:13:00.122]  That's survivalistseeds.com.

[01:13:07.944 --> 01:13:14.325]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:13:14.685 --> 01:13:16.386]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:13:17.341 --> 01:13:18.381]  But who is the enemy?
[01:13:18.882 --> 01:13:19.382]  Bin Laden.
[01:13:19.682 --> 01:13:20.662]  This is his M.O.
[01:13:20.682 --> 01:13:22.023]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:13:22.043 --> 01:13:23.663]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:13:24.043 --> 01:13:30.786]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:13:31.186 --> 01:13:31.626]  Some U.S.
[01:13:31.666 --> 01:13:37.328]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:13:38.008 --> 01:13:41.509]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:13:41.529 --> 01:13:44.309]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:14:09.158 --> 01:14:10.258]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[01:14:10.298 --> 01:14:10.659]  February 19, 2009.
[01:14:10.819 --> 01:14:11.719]  Gold opened at $981.40.
[01:14:11.759 --> 01:14:14.460]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $1,919.00, $504.59 for half, $252.30 for quarter.
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:14.960]  That's $1,919.00, $504.59, and $252.30.
[01:14:26.798 --> 01:14:27.878]  We all want liberty.
[01:14:28.098 --> 01:14:29.299]  Some give their lives for it.
[01:14:29.459 --> 01:14:31.339]  A price that cannot be taken for granted.
[01:14:31.459 --> 01:14:33.620]  We forfeit bites and pieces of our freedom.
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:34.240]  For what?
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:45.843]  February 28th, Minnesota Campaign for Liberty will host Tom Woods, best-selling author of The Meltdown, Professor Butler, author of Trade on the Great Depression, and Bill Butler to cover monetary policy.
[01:14:46.003 --> 01:14:50.184]  This workshop will empower you to be effective at meetings and conversations.
[01:14:50.324 --> 01:14:54.545]  With advanced discounts, the cost is $20, a small price for liberty.
[01:14:54.725 --> 01:14:58.667]  Go to mnc4l.com.
[01:14:58.807 --> 01:15:01.989]  That's mnc4l.com.

[01:15:08.073 --> 01:15:08.593]  You worry.
[01:15:08.973 --> 01:15:10.694]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:15:11.034 --> 01:15:13.256]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:15.457]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[01:15:19.315 --> 01:15:25.863]  Isolated from civilization, she knows that as long as the sun shines there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:15:26.224 --> 01:15:29.568]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:15:30.209 --> 01:15:31.550]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:15:31.891 --> 01:15:34.494]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[01:15:34.814 --> 01:15:37.738]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:15:38.243 --> 01:15:46.406]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:15:46.886 --> 01:15:51.268]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[01:15:51.708 --> 01:15:55.409]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.

[01:15:59.630 --> 01:16:01.111]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:16:01.131 --> 01:16:02.852]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[01:16:27.321 --> 01:16:35.907]  I'll tell you what's really disgusting to me, Bob, is to have the FBI put out training manuals saying you're an insane person if you believe in a new world order system.
[01:16:37.352 --> 01:16:39.173]  That world government doesn't exist.
[01:16:39.874 --> 01:16:45.598]  That people that believe that there's international banks setting up a structure of world government to undermine sovereignty doesn't exist.
[01:16:45.638 --> 01:16:48.600]  And then Strobe Talbot Newsweek decades ago wrote they were doing this.
[01:16:48.941 --> 01:16:50.862]  Then he was made Under Secretary of State by Clinton.
[01:16:51.623 --> 01:16:59.909]  Now, in literally hundreds of mainstream news articles, hundreds and hundreds, they're saying, oh, there's a global banking crisis.
[01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:04.532]  The answer is a Bank of the World, Time Magazine, Wall Street Journal, hundreds.
[01:17:05.433 --> 01:17:09.317]  And it's going to save you, and you'll pay carbon taxes to the bankers.
[01:17:09.717 --> 01:17:14.842]  But the FBI is still harassing people that even talk about this, trying to create a chilling effect.
[01:17:14.882 --> 01:17:16.764]  I mean, talk about double-think.
[01:17:16.804 --> 01:17:17.865]  They even admit it.
[01:17:18.165 --> 01:17:19.907]  I mean, they flat-out admit it.
[01:17:19.987 --> 01:17:24.291]  Christopher Hayes of The Nation Magazine told me flat-out.
[01:17:24.531 --> 01:17:25.912]  He admitted, yes, they're...
[01:17:26.593 --> 01:17:34.363]  There is a contingent of the elitists who believe that the whole world would be better run by a bunch of bankers and international businessmen.
[01:17:34.703 --> 01:17:35.464]  Yes, this is true.
[01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:37.186]  I mean, they flat admit it now.
[01:17:37.827 --> 01:17:39.029]  But to them, it's a good thing.
[01:17:39.987 --> 01:17:40.408]  It's great.
[01:17:40.748 --> 01:17:41.289]  I mean, why not?
[01:17:41.329 --> 01:17:42.811]  I mean, you know, the rest of us are peons.
[01:17:43.411 --> 01:17:46.114]  But then he wrote an article basically saying there wasn't a North American Union.
[01:17:46.855 --> 01:17:56.366]  His article from a year and a half ago was that there was a trans-Texas corridor being going to be built, but there was no NAFTA superhighway.
[01:17:57.507 --> 01:18:05.312]  Even though you had the Fed saying 34 interstate highways, international zones for international taxation, the SPP documents, they just, no, we're not writing about that.
[01:18:05.392 --> 01:18:17.058]  Even though they changed the laws to allow the tolling of previously non-tollable infrastructure, you know, both in the United States and then of course they did it in Texas, they were trying to
[01:18:19.266 --> 01:18:21.408]  told the interstate system within Texas.
[01:18:21.548 --> 01:18:25.851]  I mean, look, they do all this stuff and then they just sit there and they think we're a bunch of idiots.
[01:18:38.638 --> 01:18:48.606]  Again, quoting, "...the super-national sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in the last centuries."
[01:18:48.666 --> 01:18:50.987]  Yeah, that's his standard New World Order speak 101.
[01:18:51.688 --> 01:18:58.013]  And of course, you know, the other famous quote from David Rockefeller, who's like the poster child of the bad guys... The Omni-Budsman!
[01:18:58.153 --> 01:18:59.374]  Yeah, as far as we're concerned.
[01:18:59.594 --> 01:19:15.861]  I mean, in his own book, Memoirs, on page 405, he states that there's a bunch of crazy people who think that I'm part of an international cabal working against the best interests of the United States of America in order to form a one world government, and then he says, hey, if that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I'm proud of it.
[01:19:16.242 --> 01:19:17.622]  I mean, right there in your face.
[01:19:17.942 --> 01:19:22.304]  We can play a clip of Walter Cronkite saying world government must be set up.
[01:19:22.684 --> 01:19:26.366]  Yeah, yeah, and you know, there's an example right there of media lies.
[01:19:26.406 --> 01:19:27.967]  I mean, they, they,
[01:19:28.911 --> 01:19:33.834]  People like Rockefeller, people like the people that control, you know, the elites, they control the media!
[01:19:34.334 --> 01:19:38.176]  And the media is nothing but a lie machine.
[01:19:38.696 --> 01:19:41.758]  You asked me to come in here and talk about the mainstream media a little bit today.
[01:19:41.838 --> 01:19:43.719]  The whole thing is a lie machine.
[01:19:44.039 --> 01:19:48.342]  All you gotta do is pick up the paper, open it up, and you will find lies.
[01:19:49.002 --> 01:19:52.824]  Of all sorts, there's like four different, four or five different kinds that they just spew out all over.
[01:19:52.864 --> 01:19:53.864]  Yeah, a lot of it's spin.
[01:19:53.904 --> 01:20:00.167]  They'll say, isn't it great, we're going to take your DNA every time you're arrested for any misdemeanor to keep you safe, but we know that it's to control.
[01:20:00.267 --> 01:20:00.907]  An example.
[01:20:00.987 --> 01:20:02.348]  An example of spin.
[01:20:02.408 --> 01:20:06.570]  For example, they will tell you, like in the paper the other day, I've got it front here in the Statesman.
[01:20:07.210 --> 01:20:07.470]  U.S.
[01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:09.631]  cancer rate on decline for the first time.
[01:20:10.072 --> 01:20:16.595]  Deaths also drop, and they say it's a long-awaited turning point, and the cancer rate deaths have dropped a percent and a half.
[01:20:16.995 --> 01:20:17.856]  Whoopee!
[01:20:18.176 --> 01:20:19.537]  But who cares?
[01:20:19.577 --> 01:20:21.458]  By the way, that's only certain types.
[01:20:21.538 --> 01:20:21.878]  Yeah.
[01:20:22.138 --> 01:20:24.559]  Overall cancer diagnosis is way up.
[01:20:24.739 --> 01:20:24.980]  I know.
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.100]  They lie.
[01:20:26.821 --> 01:20:32.183]  A few months ago they had an article saying that when only 550,000 people croaked to cancer, as opposed to 560,000 people the previous year,
[01:20:36.966 --> 01:20:38.469]  The death rate has plummeted.
[01:20:39.130 --> 01:20:40.172]  Now, you want to talk about spin?
[01:20:40.272 --> 01:20:41.193]  Well, I mean, let's go further.
[01:20:43.652 --> 01:20:49.396]  If you go back to the 1950s numbers, 1 out of 33 would die of cancer.
[01:20:50.036 --> 01:20:51.557]  Now 1 of 3 die of cancer.
[01:20:51.577 --> 01:20:57.581]  And then they also spin the numbers and say people are living longer today, but that's not true.
[01:20:57.821 --> 01:21:08.328]  If you take out infant mortality, because previously around 30 to 40% of children would die by age 5, but then if you made it past that you would end up living longer, up until your 80s on average.
[01:21:08.749 --> 01:21:12.431]  Now it's down in the mid-70s because we do have lower infant mortality.
[01:21:12.611 --> 01:21:13.592]  So they also cook the numbers.
[01:21:13.932 --> 01:21:16.292]  Yeah, so again, that's a form of spin.
[01:21:16.713 --> 01:21:18.473]  But, you know, spin is one way they lie.
[01:21:18.933 --> 01:21:22.914]  My favorite, well, the main way they lie is by omission.
[01:21:23.374 --> 01:21:24.354]  They don't cover the news.
[01:21:24.834 --> 01:21:35.656]  And if you want examples of them not covering the news, all you've got to do is go to Infowars.com or say WhatReallyHappened.com and look at the news that's there and then see if it's in the mainstream media.
[01:21:35.836 --> 01:21:37.856]  And you'll find out that it's not there.
[01:21:38.616 --> 01:21:39.556]  They just lie about omission.
[01:21:39.837 --> 01:21:40.817]  They don't want you to know about it.
[01:21:40.837 --> 01:21:42.117]  They just pull the blanket over your head.
[01:21:42.836 --> 01:21:45.399]  Yeah, or they'll lie and say Iraq has WMDs.
[01:21:45.419 --> 01:21:45.519]  Yeah.
[01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:49.703]  And now they're saying Iran's got WMDs and it's got to be attacked.
[01:21:50.224 --> 01:21:55.329]  All right, we'll be right back after this quick break with your phone calls and a lot more with Bob Dacey in studio.
[01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:56.290]  Stay with us.
[01:21:58.593 --> 01:22:01.576]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:22:02.517 --> 01:22:05.180]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:08.132 --> 01:22:09.633]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:22:09.813 --> 01:22:11.275]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:22:11.555 --> 01:22:13.797]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:22:14.237 --> 01:22:18.981]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:22:19.381 --> 01:22:22.224]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:22:22.564 --> 01:22:26.067]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.

[01:22:41.042 --> 01:22:42.323]  I use one every day.
[01:22:42.743 --> 01:22:45.205]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:22:45.565 --> 01:22:47.106]  On September 11th, 2001, along with
[01:23:11.519 --> 01:23:13.800]  Hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:15.340]  And we knew what to do.
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.140]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:23.782]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:23:24.382 --> 01:23:32.924]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:23:33.308 --> 01:23:40.090]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:43.451]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:23:43.571 --> 01:23:48.772]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:23:49.332 --> 01:23:51.993]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[01:24:11.454 --> 01:24:18.639]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.

[01:24:49.878 --> 01:24:55.682]  Families need this high-quality natural food source for its low price and long storage shelf life.
[01:24:56.206 --> 01:24:56.706]  This is not good.
[01:25:19.594 --> 01:25:38.056]  By the way, don't forget we have a online video and bookstore and a lot of other great titles and films and books that I haven't written or made that we carry that I think are very informative like the new video just out, Part 3 in the Secret History of America, Eye of the Phoenix, Secrets of the Dollar Bill.

[01:25:48.563 --> 01:25:58.108]  This is the overall general film that shows the secret elites, their own documents, their own plans, how they're eugenicists, how they test chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals on the people of the world.
[01:25:58.628 --> 01:26:00.629]  Very, very important documentary.
[01:26:00.649 --> 01:26:03.711]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:26:04.231 --> 01:26:05.832]  Those can all ship right now if you order them.
[01:26:05.872 --> 01:26:06.713]  If you want to pre-order,

[01:26:10.894 --> 01:26:12.514]  That's theobamadeception.net.
[01:26:12.614 --> 01:26:14.255]  A lot of folks are pre-ordering that film.

[01:26:20.456 --> 01:26:25.797]  So again, theobamadeception.net or call toll free to secure your copy today.
[01:26:25.817 --> 01:26:26.217]  888-253-3139.
[01:26:26.578 --> 01:26:31.959]  And I want everybody that orders The Obama Deception or any of the films I've made
[01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:34.042]  to make copies.
[01:26:34.082 --> 01:26:48.910]  I want you to get a DVD burner, I want you to buy a bunch of blanks, and please get these out to everybody because he is a front man, he is a corporate shill, he is betraying the well-meaning people that rejected Bush's phony wars and fake WMDs and torture and corruption.
[01:26:49.930 --> 01:26:52.172]  And claiming all this executive power and secrecy.
[01:26:52.573 --> 01:26:55.756]  Obama is now announcing all of that is going to continue.
[01:26:55.776 --> 01:26:57.858]  The executive secrecy, all of it.
[01:26:58.179 --> 01:27:00.181]  This is an incredible betrayal.
[01:27:00.321 --> 01:27:03.024]  The lobbyists, the money, the bankers robbing us.
[01:27:03.524 --> 01:27:06.127]  The film gets into the issues that can't be debated.
[01:27:06.367 --> 01:27:08.049]  You can debate if he was really born in Kenya.
[01:27:08.409 --> 01:27:10.391]  You can debate the birth certificate, all that stuff.
[01:27:10.411 --> 01:27:13.054]  The media focused on that because they weren't afraid of it.
[01:27:13.354 --> 01:27:19.656]  They will not focus on his deceit, and his lies, and his betrayals, and the corrupt special interests that are controlling him.
[01:27:19.696 --> 01:27:24.017]  So the ObamaDeception.net or 888-253-3139.
[01:27:25.017 --> 01:27:26.237]  Bob, I want to go to phone calls.
[01:27:26.297 --> 01:27:33.039]  Matt, Glenn, Drew, Michael, Nick, and many others from all over the country and the world that are calling in, but Bob Dasey first.
[01:27:34.602 --> 01:27:36.163]  You've got some more lies of the media.
[01:27:36.183 --> 01:27:40.787]  I want you to go through some of those and then let's get into how they're trying to shut down the alternative media.
[01:27:41.847 --> 01:27:43.549]  We're talking about lies in the media.
[01:27:43.569 --> 01:27:44.650]  Let's just pick one.
[01:27:45.090 --> 01:27:46.251]  What about the bailout coverage?
[01:27:46.791 --> 01:27:53.396]  I remember the last time I was live in studio with you was the day that the House of Representatives rejected the initial bailout.
[01:27:53.416 --> 01:27:55.458]  I think it was like September the 30th or something like that.
[01:27:56.298 --> 01:28:05.244]  I went home and I watched the news, and they were saying that they saw the stock market drop after the House rejected the bailout package.
[01:28:05.964 --> 01:28:13.669]  And the media was saying, listen, look at the dollar value we lost in the market because you didn't vote for this thing.
[01:28:14.410 --> 01:28:15.811]  It was more than the bailout.
[01:28:16.527 --> 01:28:22.271]  I mean, they actually presented that as if that was some sort of a cause and effect relationship or actually had a meaning to it.
[01:28:22.291 --> 01:28:23.632]  And that was financial terrorism.
[01:28:23.672 --> 01:28:30.998]  What really happened is having the President and Obama and the head of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department come out and say, we're going into a depression.
[01:28:31.498 --> 01:28:34.320]  If you don't pass this, we'll be destroyed by next Monday.
[01:28:34.641 --> 01:28:36.702]  That destroyed confidence in the market, dropped.
[01:28:37.002 --> 01:28:40.125]  And it's dropped 2,000 points almost since that point.
[01:28:40.485 --> 01:28:44.208]  And then the day after they pass it, they say, oh, we're not going to use it anymore.
[01:28:44.948 --> 01:28:47.871]  Uh, to buy up, uh, bad debt from these mortgages.
[01:28:47.911 --> 01:28:49.912]  We're not gonna say where it's going.
[01:28:50.073 --> 01:28:53.616]  Yeah, and where was the screaming banner headlines in the media that day?
[01:28:54.156 --> 01:28:55.177]  They were lying to us.
[01:28:55.217 --> 01:28:58.199]  They're not gonna, they're not gonna bail out the crooked, the bad mortgages.
[01:28:58.259 --> 01:28:58.840]  Where was it?
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:28:59.661]  It was nowhere.
[01:28:59.961 --> 01:29:01.122]  The spin was elsewhere.
[01:29:01.682 --> 01:29:16.877]  Well they moved on from the $9.7 trillion banker takeover, not $800 billion, Bloomberg reported $9.7, they won't say where the money went, to should we give $50 billion to the auto companies, a pittance, and made it all a debate about that as a diversion.
[01:29:17.796 --> 01:29:19.558]  I mean, take the fluoride coverage.
[01:29:19.798 --> 01:29:21.120]  Oh, I'm sorry, what fluoride coverage?
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:21.981]  Where is that?
[01:29:22.301 --> 01:29:25.004]  I mean, there's tons of evidence about how bad fluoride is.
[01:29:25.024 --> 01:29:28.348]  But the feds have spent billions of dollars forcing this in our water.
[01:29:28.448 --> 01:29:33.233]  And where is the front page media coverage giving fair presentation to this?
[01:29:33.534 --> 01:29:34.234]  It's not there.
[01:29:34.975 --> 01:29:35.695]  Where is it?
[01:29:36.115 --> 01:29:41.037]  Instead, in the name of being fair, Clinton, Hillary and Bill Clinton, a bunch of U.S.
[01:29:41.077 --> 01:29:48.098]  Senators are saying, we're not just going to have fairness doctrine and control what you can say and do on the radio, we're going to do it on the Internet.
[01:29:48.158 --> 01:29:52.219]  And Canada's announced they're about to start censoring the Internet to only a few thousand websites.
[01:29:52.259 --> 01:29:54.100]  It's actually in the Toronto Star.
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:56.523]  Yeah, and take a look at the vaccine thing.
[01:29:56.563 --> 01:30:04.053]  I mean, just the other day in the paper, they're saying right here in the Statesman that the evidence fails to link autism to vaccines, court declares.
[01:30:04.374 --> 01:30:10.162]  So a court has ruled that there's no evidence linking autism to vaccines.
[01:30:10.702 --> 01:30:24.571]  And then out of hundreds of studies, including government studies, showing that mercury does cause brain damage and goes to the blood-brain barrier, they ignore those and use one guy who claims he found evidence it was autism to have him say he faked it.
[01:30:24.931 --> 01:30:26.112]  As if it's all discredited.
[01:30:26.592 --> 01:30:28.294]  As if we haven't gone, in 1975, from one in
[01:30:31.633 --> 01:30:32.614]  Well, what's the number?
[01:30:32.914 --> 01:30:33.995]  I'm going to pull up the exact number.
[01:30:34.515 --> 01:30:39.019]  One in 2,600 having autism, to now one in 87.
[01:30:39.059 --> 01:30:42.241]  Yeah, and take any issue.
[01:30:42.321 --> 01:30:44.022]  The global warming issue, for example.
[01:30:44.383 --> 01:30:48.506]  I mean, the media presents global warming as if it is a fact.
[01:30:48.726 --> 01:30:50.547]  And that polar bears can't swim.
[01:30:50.668 --> 01:30:57.333]  And that there's no debating, there's nothing you can say, it's a fact, and you people got to deal with it, and that we caused it.
[01:30:57.833 --> 01:31:03.497]  You know, I've got some quotes here from some very famous scientists who just laugh at that assertion.
[01:31:03.977 --> 01:31:11.823]  You know, from the New American, here's one from a doctor in Norwegian, I'm sorry, a Norwegian doctor.
[01:31:11.863 --> 01:31:14.785]  He says, quote, anyone who claims that the debate is over
[01:31:15.325 --> 01:31:21.829]  And that the conclusions are firm has a fundamentally unscientific approach to one of the most momentous issues of our time.
[01:31:22.209 --> 01:31:24.730]  And here's one from U.S.
[01:31:24.811 --> 01:31:32.195]  government atmospheric scientist Stanley B. Goldenberg of the Hurricane Research Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
[01:31:32.475 --> 01:31:42.621]  Quote, it is a blatant lie put forth in the media that makes it seem like it is only a fringe of scientists who don't buy into anthropological global warming.
[01:31:43.061 --> 01:31:43.601]  I mean, come on!
[01:31:44.001 --> 01:31:46.082]  Because it goes in a 10,000 year cycle.
[01:31:46.542 --> 01:32:00.388]  The last Bronze Age started during a 3,000 year warming period, and then they had a mini-warm period about a thousand years ago, and they were growing grapes all over England, where you can't even grow grapes today.
[01:32:00.408 --> 01:32:05.390]  And they know this from the ice core samples, they understand this, and then the UN claimed they had 2,400 scientists.
[01:32:06.630 --> 01:32:11.494]  That had signed on saying man-made global warming was real, and then they went and questioned the scientists.
[01:32:11.514 --> 01:32:13.416]  The scientists said, no, we were just invited to a conference.
[01:32:13.796 --> 01:32:14.677]  I don't agree with this.
[01:32:14.717 --> 01:32:16.178]  So they say, everyone agrees.
[01:32:16.518 --> 01:32:18.980]  Then all these scientists, tens of thousands, come out and say, no, we don't.
[01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:21.162]  And they say, well, everybody who's credible agrees.
[01:32:21.422 --> 01:32:33.692]  Then they claim you're funded by the oil companies if you cite the science that the entire solar system has been heating up, and now the sun just cooled off, so suddenly the solar system is cooling.
[01:32:33.752 --> 01:32:40.941]  Now here's a quote from a Dr. David Gee, the Chairman of the Science Committee of the 2008 International Geological Congress.
[01:32:40.961 --> 01:32:41.581]  Listen to this quote.
[01:32:42.322 --> 01:32:46.567]  For how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand that the planet is not warming?
[01:32:47.188 --> 01:32:50.011]  For how many... I mean, come on, that's a funny, isn't it funny?
[01:32:50.031 --> 01:32:51.113]  Isn't that hilarious?
[01:32:51.133 --> 01:32:52.194]  The thing's cooling down now.
[01:32:52.454 --> 01:32:53.516]  But, you know, they shifted.
[01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.829]  Now they've shifted.
[01:32:54.849 --> 01:32:57.110]  They said, well now it was global warming, and it's your fault, Alex.
[01:32:57.470 --> 01:33:00.991]  But now, it might be global cooling, and it's still your fault, Alex.
[01:33:01.091 --> 01:33:07.713]  And they're saying it's climate change, as if we don't have four seasons, as if we haven't always gone through cycles.
[01:33:08.153 --> 01:33:12.414]  They can't even predict the weather in Austin, Texas, a week from now.
[01:33:14.302 --> 01:33:25.769]  Well, the insane part about it is that they've built this carbon-based economy, and I'm not even saying oil is a good system because it's toxic in the cracking and the refining of it.
[01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:32.514]  But the point here is that you know when the Super Bowl and Exxon Mobil are telling you global warming is real and we need a tax.
[01:33:33.234 --> 01:33:33.975]  That it's a scam.
[01:33:34.455 --> 01:33:40.662]  And then Al Gore with the World Bank and the IMF owns the major company that we will buy carbon credits from.
[01:33:40.982 --> 01:33:44.846]  This guy stands, and by the way he owns an oil company.
[01:33:45.887 --> 01:33:46.648]  Al Gore is an oilman.
[01:33:46.668 --> 01:33:47.569]  He owns an oil company.
[01:33:48.029 --> 01:33:52.033]  Al Gore owns the major carbon trading company.
[01:33:52.694 --> 01:33:55.136]  That we're going to buy our carbon credits from.
[01:33:55.176 --> 01:33:55.556]  Think about that.
[01:33:55.716 --> 01:34:01.379]  Al Gore owns the major carbon trading company that we will buy carbon credits from.
[01:34:01.399 --> 01:34:02.020]  And here's another one.
[01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:03.561]  Let's say global warming's real.
[01:34:04.221 --> 01:34:05.062]  It's all man-made.
[01:34:05.102 --> 01:34:05.782]  It's all true.
[01:34:05.842 --> 01:34:06.623]  Nobody's lying.
[01:34:07.023 --> 01:34:08.304]  The polar bears can't swim.
[01:34:08.524 --> 01:34:09.484]  The glaciers are all melting.
[01:34:09.504 --> 01:34:10.065]  We're all dead.
[01:34:10.885 --> 01:34:24.876]  Unless we have this tax, they admit that it'll only be on Western nations, and so the industry will move to China and India and 160 other third world countries that will have no emissions controls, so emissions will actually go up!
[01:34:25.336 --> 01:34:35.384]  So explain to me and explain to your audience, Alex, how a factory in the United States, which is producing widgets, which has the EPA crawling all over them all the time,
[01:34:36.064 --> 01:34:44.608]  How moving that factory to China, so they can produce those widgets over there, with no EPA crawling over them all the time, how does that save the planet?
[01:34:44.688 --> 01:34:44.988]  Tell me.
[01:34:45.028 --> 01:34:48.630]  No, it ups the level of carbon, which if you look at the studies is actually good.
[01:34:48.690 --> 01:34:51.311]  We need to have some warming because we're going into this new ice age.
[01:34:51.331 --> 01:34:52.972]  Well, I know the logic is too, too...
[01:34:53.976 --> 01:34:55.778]  Too basic for people to understand.
[01:34:55.918 --> 01:35:04.526]  I wish humans actually had an effect on our warming, because every study shows that all plant life and animal life does better during these warming periods.
[01:35:04.586 --> 01:35:07.609]  Unfortunately, the sun cooled down and we're going into a cooling period.
[01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:15.316]  And the bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, is that the human cause of global warming, or global cooling, take your pick.
[01:35:15.356 --> 01:35:16.257]  Less than one percent.
[01:35:16.417 --> 01:35:17.177]  Is a crock.
[01:35:18.038 --> 01:35:21.440]  It's all meant to make you think you've got to lower your standard of living.
[01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:22.701]  And they brag and say that.
[01:35:22.981 --> 01:35:23.841]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:35:24.202 --> 01:35:24.742]  That's the thing.
[01:35:24.782 --> 01:35:27.583]  These arrogant bastards admit that this is a scam.
[01:35:28.224 --> 01:35:30.305]  And they think we're so ignorant we can't figure it out.
[01:35:30.625 --> 01:35:37.149]  Remember when I had Rothschild on two years ago, it's an endgame, and he said no, he said... He didn't even know the solar system.
[01:35:37.289 --> 01:35:41.631]  I said, why are the moons of Jupiter and Saturn melting, the ones that are covered with methane ice?
[01:35:41.971 --> 01:35:44.053]  Why are the ice caps on Mars getting smaller?
[01:35:44.893 --> 01:35:50.898]  And he said, well, number one, that Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are closer to the Sun than Earth.
[01:35:51.038 --> 01:35:51.519]  I heard him say it.
[01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:55.562]  And I said, no sir, it goes Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and then out.
[01:35:55.922 --> 01:36:09.174]  And he said, no, you're wrong, and laughed at me, because he knew the audience, or he thought they were, he knows the general public, he knew, is so dumbed down, just desperately dumbed down, and I got emails saying that Mars is closer to the Sun.
[01:36:09.774 --> 01:36:19.463]  I have been convinced by many years of watching the mainstream media that my truck is the cause of the melting of the polar ice caps of Mars.
[01:36:19.723 --> 01:36:20.884]  I sincerely believe that.
[01:36:20.904 --> 01:36:22.905]  Because I watch the mainstream media.
[01:36:23.006 --> 01:36:24.107]  I know it's my truck that did it.
[01:36:24.147 --> 01:36:27.429]  Well, polar bears are going to drown on Mars because of the... Absolutely, man.
[01:36:27.469 --> 01:36:28.070]  I'll tell you what.
[01:36:28.130 --> 01:36:31.433]  I mean, to believe this stuff, you've got to be just not thinking anymore.
[01:36:31.453 --> 01:36:33.234]  Well, listen, that's what Club of Rome said.
[01:36:33.555 --> 01:36:34.676]  We need a new religion.
[01:36:35.276 --> 01:36:37.157]  So we're getting rid of the Geo-Christian system.
[01:36:37.417 --> 01:36:41.379]  We need to have a religion based on humans are bad so the state can wage war against humanity.
[01:36:41.639 --> 01:36:43.060]  I mean, that's a quote!
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:50.584]  And the bottom line here is when you have a group of people who think that humanity is scum, and they want to run the planet, guess what?
[01:36:50.724 --> 01:36:52.265]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a problem.
[01:36:53.005 --> 01:36:53.766]  We got a problem.
[01:36:57.007 --> 01:36:57.507]  Absolutely.
[01:36:57.547 --> 01:36:58.688]  Let's take some phone calls.
[01:36:58.768 --> 01:36:59.569]  Matt in Illinois.
[01:36:59.589 --> 01:37:00.869]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:03.230]  Hello, Alex.
[01:37:03.731 --> 01:37:04.171]  Hello, sir.
[01:37:04.912 --> 01:37:10.358]  Hi, um, I'd just like to start my call by saying I'm 22 and I think all this stuff is unfair.
[01:37:11.299 --> 01:37:26.276]  And, uh, so yeah, so I started, um, listening to your show, like, in 2006, 2005, and, like, I, uh, you know, talked on the internet about it, and, um, someone, uh, bugged my house, and, um, it, it, I was just wondering if you've had similar experiences with that.
[01:37:27.426 --> 01:37:31.370]  Well, sir, I don't know what particularly happened to you, but we're all bugged.
[01:37:32.110 --> 01:37:48.585]  Google admits, and Yahoo admits they have patents and are doing it with the onboard microphone in all new computers, and the little camera, and now Apple has a patent and they're coming out with it where the screen itself is a camera, so you can't escape it.
[01:37:49.346 --> 01:38:11.771]  I was at home, I put a piece of tape over it, and they admit that AI computers, they say, don't worry, a human isn't listening, AI computers are dialing in and listening for keywords, and if they hear a dog barking in your house, Google ads for dog food, or dog health care products, or dog frisbees, this is Google saying this, this isn't me, pop up, and you tell somebody that, and they just can't believe it.
[01:38:11.851 --> 01:38:18.573]  Or I told people OnStar was being used for the FBI and others to dial in without warrants and listen to you, because it's an audio system on a cell phone based.
[01:38:19.473 --> 01:38:22.195]  Or I tell people about all this, they can't believe it.
[01:38:22.275 --> 01:38:29.658]  And then the media, instead of covering what we're saying, they'll focus in on some guy on the internet doing a hoax, claiming that his digital TV converter
[01:38:31.866 --> 01:38:32.647]  Has a microphone
[01:38:50.157 --> 01:38:51.678]  Oh no, the feds have announced it's coming in.
[01:38:51.698 --> 01:38:59.665]  And force everyone to have some little gizmo in their car so they can just, you can be a little bug on their screen the whole day long, know exactly where you went.
[01:38:59.685 --> 01:39:07.811]  Well, they're already using, under the Telecommunications Act of 96, all cell phones, even when they're off, are GPS triangulated by the cell towers and they dial in with the audio.
[01:39:07.992 --> 01:39:19.261]  And the first time I saw it, five years ago, it's in Matrix of Evil, the governor of Wisconsin blurted out, it was in the newspaper, that, oh, we're tracking you with your cell phones at the Emergency Management Center everywhere you go.
[01:39:20.151 --> 01:39:20.411]  Yeah.
[01:39:20.851 --> 01:39:21.691]  So that's what I'm saying.
[01:39:21.711 --> 01:39:28.874]  Now they're going to be bringing it out in the open in a nice conference to discuss the feasibility of taxing you depending on where you go and how you drive.
[01:39:29.094 --> 01:39:32.675]  And of course, in order to do that, you know, you just have to be plugged into the matrix, don't you?
[01:39:33.535 --> 01:39:33.775]  Yes.
[01:39:34.015 --> 01:39:35.015]  Thank you, caller.
[01:39:35.535 --> 01:39:37.876]  Let's talk to Glenn in Pennsylvania.
[01:39:37.936 --> 01:39:38.816]  Glenn, you're on the air.
[01:39:40.837 --> 01:39:41.477]  Yes, Alex.
[01:39:41.977 --> 01:39:42.297]  Yes, sir.
[01:39:42.918 --> 01:39:43.298]  Yes, sir.
[01:39:43.338 --> 01:39:45.098]  Good afternoon.
[01:39:45.638 --> 01:39:46.519]  I just wanted to call.
[01:39:46.599 --> 01:39:47.619]  I'm a first time caller.
[01:39:48.417 --> 01:40:00.963]  And about 13 years ago, my brother was in San Antonio and about two years ago, I injured myself and he told me, he said, start listening to this guy.
[01:40:02.024 --> 01:40:03.045]  He knows what's going on.
[01:40:03.565 --> 01:40:05.826]  So I started to pick up on you and I started to listen.
[01:40:06.826 --> 01:40:08.127]  I got so much to talk about.
[01:40:08.968 --> 01:40:10.668]  You've been listening for 13 years.
[01:40:11.549 --> 01:40:12.449]  My brother has been.
[01:40:14.630 --> 01:40:15.611]  My brother has been.
[01:40:17.943 --> 01:40:21.245]  He was one of your first people down in San Antonio.
[01:40:21.806 --> 01:40:22.006]  Yeah.
[01:40:23.527 --> 01:40:41.241]  Okay, I got so much to talk about, but the main thing is that you had a caller on yesterday that sounded like he didn't know what he was... he had been listening or anything, and he wanted to find out when you wanted to... what the sign was going to be.
[01:40:42.538 --> 01:41:00.693]  Yeah, he was saying that I don't cover population control and reduction, so this credibility went out the window then, and then he said that, oh, there's really kind of no hope and nobody's doing anything, when the state of Texas is introducing tomorrow a bill to declare sovereignty against the feds that have been taken over by foreign banks.
[01:41:00.713 --> 01:41:02.635]  I mean, all we do is talk about solutions.
[01:41:03.596 --> 01:41:09.301]  Well, I hope that the state of Texas passes that and that
[01:41:10.273 --> 01:41:15.576]  Wouldn't it be ironic if the Lone Star State were to lead the rest of us?
[01:41:16.677 --> 01:41:31.446]  The thing is that once we start, everybody's going to have to kick in and give them so much heartache and spread them so thin that we would be able to defeat them at that point in time.
[01:41:31.566 --> 01:41:31.986]  That's right.
[01:41:32.026 --> 01:41:32.347]  I hear you.
[01:41:32.367 --> 01:41:33.127]  I appreciate the call.
[01:41:33.507 --> 01:41:34.948]  Drew in Oregon, you're on the air.
[01:41:34.968 --> 01:41:39.311]  Go ahead, Drew, if you want to be on air.
[01:41:40.948 --> 01:41:41.649]  Oh hey, how's it going?
[01:41:42.029 --> 01:41:42.629]  Good, go ahead.
[01:41:43.910 --> 01:42:00.702]  Well, I was calling to talk about the... I'm in Portland, Oregon, and currently I've been noticing that I went to go get on the light rail that runs throughout the city here, and I noticed that they replaced all the machines with credit-only machines.
[01:42:01.202 --> 01:42:01.823]  Yep.
[01:42:02.443 --> 01:42:07.287]  Not to mention that I use the transit quite a bit here, and a lot recently I've noticed
[01:42:08.482 --> 01:42:11.473]  There have been a lot of police and transit checkers.
[01:42:12.068 --> 01:42:14.550]  Walking around asking for people's ideas.
[01:42:14.570 --> 01:42:18.533]  Yeah, first they train you to go through checkpoints and be searched at airports.
[01:42:18.573 --> 01:42:19.433]  That's dog training.
[01:42:19.713 --> 01:42:21.775]  To be a slave, line up, show us your papers.
[01:42:22.175 --> 01:42:25.498]  Then it's the transit, then it's the trains, then it's the side of the street.
[01:42:25.558 --> 01:42:26.779]  Homeland Security admits this.
[01:42:27.419 --> 01:42:39.548]  And Southwest Airlines, major train stations, businesses are saying no cash now because they're getting ready in the next few years to abolish the dollar, bring in a North American Union currency that is digital.
[01:42:40.208 --> 01:42:43.129]  And that's why they now have the North American Union ID card.
[01:42:43.770 --> 01:42:44.110]  Stay there.
[01:42:44.130 --> 01:42:45.310]  We'll talk more about it when we get back.
[01:42:45.330 --> 01:42:47.511]  And I want to get Bob Dacey's take on that as well.
[01:42:47.731 --> 01:42:50.473]  You want to ride shotgun a little bit with us with Mike Rivero coming up?
[01:42:50.573 --> 01:42:50.953]  Why not?
[01:42:51.513 --> 01:42:51.853]  Alright.
[01:42:52.133 --> 01:42:53.334]  I can see Mike Rivero.
[01:42:53.954 --> 01:42:54.875]  He's waiting in the wings.
[01:42:54.895 --> 01:42:56.375]  He'll be with us in about 10 minutes.
[01:42:56.836 --> 01:42:59.257]  There he is on screen right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:59.857 --> 01:43:01.638]  So we'll be right back.
[01:43:01.678 --> 01:43:06.000]  He'll be joining us from Hawaii, and I see the Australian film crew right out there.
[01:43:08.174 --> 01:43:10.816]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[01:43:11.397 --> 01:43:14.359]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[01:43:14.719 --> 01:43:18.142]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[01:43:18.503 --> 01:43:24.708]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[01:43:25.088 --> 01:43:30.132]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[01:43:30.312 --> 01:43:37.018]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[01:43:37.318 --> 01:43:38.198]  Need something more?
[01:43:38.418 --> 01:43:42.060]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.

[01:44:08.233 --> 01:44:14.637]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:44:14.998 --> 01:44:16.659]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:44:17.811 --> 01:44:18.651]  Who is the enemy?
[01:44:19.172 --> 01:44:19.672]  Bin Laden.
[01:44:19.972 --> 01:44:20.952]  This is his ammo.
[01:44:20.972 --> 01:44:22.273]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:44:22.333 --> 01:44:23.993]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:44:24.333 --> 01:44:31.076]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:44:31.476 --> 01:44:31.916]  Some U.S.
[01:44:31.956 --> 01:44:37.598]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:44:38.298 --> 01:44:41.801]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:44:41.821 --> 01:44:44.604]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:45:08.809 --> 01:45:14.274]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:45:14.314 --> 01:45:14.835]  and the world.
[01:45:15.095 --> 01:45:18.558]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:45:18.978 --> 01:45:25.204]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:45:25.464 --> 01:45:27.266]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:45:27.506 --> 01:45:32.671]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[01:45:32.951 --> 01:45:33.212]  I think so.
[01:45:50.994 --> 01:45:52.675]  Day after day Alone on a hill
[01:46:19.264 --> 01:46:25.906]  Okay, let's go right back to Drew in Oregon.
[01:46:26.826 --> 01:46:30.988]  Drew, go ahead and finish the point you were getting at.
[01:46:31.048 --> 01:46:39.270]  So now, in New York, in Houston, in Dallas, in Boston, in Chicago, in LA, in Portland, everywhere, the transit police
[01:46:39.870 --> 01:46:40.771]  Well, it's not just that, Alex.
[01:47:08.985 --> 01:47:14.028]  I'm confounded as to why Oregon isn't on board with the sovereignty bill.
[01:47:14.208 --> 01:47:18.470]  I mean, we're a really liberal state and we've got Washington and California on it.
[01:47:18.570 --> 01:47:29.256]  I've written to the Oregon representative and asked him about the sovereignty bills and what he knew about them and I got a reply saying, what should I know about them?
[01:47:31.037 --> 01:47:37.141]  I'm wondering where the Oregon supporters are and I'm really not
[01:47:37.987 --> 01:47:41.890]  I'm not satisfied so far with the level of organization and planning.
[01:47:41.950 --> 01:47:43.511]  Well, look, you've got to make that happen.
[01:47:43.571 --> 01:47:44.551]  I mean, take last week.
[01:47:44.611 --> 01:47:46.332]  I said, why hasn't Texas introduced this?
[01:47:46.653 --> 01:47:58.640]  We've got a state rep on Friday who is introducing a sovereignty Tenth Amendment declaration that they know the feds have been globalized and are illegitimate, and that the state's not going to go along with gun confiscation, martial law, or anything else.
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.763]  I mean, this is being introduced all over the country, and it's thanks to people like you calling.
[01:48:03.263 --> 01:48:05.444]  You know, and the rep asked, what should I know?
[01:48:05.925 --> 01:48:11.628]  Send them some of the other bills from around the country, point out what's happening, the unfunded mandates, and that's how you get them on board.
[01:48:11.688 --> 01:48:12.069]  Bob Dacey.
[01:48:12.089 --> 01:48:13.289]  I'm going to tell you something.
[01:48:13.309 --> 01:48:15.451]  You're talking about this sovereignty thing?
[01:48:16.672 --> 01:48:18.473]  I think it's a fantastic idea.
[01:48:18.733 --> 01:48:23.696]  You've got to have, in order to stop this, you've got to have civil disobedience in all levels of society.
[01:48:23.716 --> 01:48:25.837]  You're talking about individual people, you talked about
[01:48:27.193 --> 01:48:33.998]  Municipalities like when, through your efforts, the city of Austin passed a resolution against the Patriot Act several years ago.
[01:48:34.398 --> 01:48:36.219]  That was spearheaded by Alex Jones.
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:39.661]  And at the state level, yeah, the same thing.
[01:48:39.681 --> 01:48:45.225]  Listen, all they're doing is asserting the Constitution, the 10th Amendment.
[01:48:45.345 --> 01:48:51.429]  The state's constituted, the federal government, and when it becomes destructive, they can dissolve it and reconstitute it.
[01:48:51.469 --> 01:48:56.573]  Instead, the feds are illegitimately dissolving the state's real power and bringing us into globalism.
[01:48:56.613 --> 01:48:56.933]  And listen,
[01:48:57.773 --> 01:49:00.254]  Not tooting my horn, it's the audience we're talking about.
[01:49:00.414 --> 01:49:03.736]  What did I do in 2001 after October passed the Patriot Act?
[01:49:03.776 --> 01:49:15.121]  I wrote an analysis of how it abolished six of the ten Bill of Rights, how it was illegitimate, and I said, people need to get together and write resolutions for the states, counties, and cities to say, we're going to follow the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[01:49:15.401 --> 01:49:20.823]  Groups formed, hundreds of cities, over 800 passed it, and seven states.
[01:49:21.384 --> 01:49:23.745]  Again, because you took the ball.
[01:49:24.065 --> 01:49:26.046]  That's right, and we've got to continue to take the ball.
[01:49:26.986 --> 01:49:29.867]  I've said this before, but I think it bears repeating.
[01:49:30.187 --> 01:49:32.569]  When I was a kid, I used to make fun of the hippies all the time.
[01:49:32.609 --> 01:49:34.469]  I was just underneath the hippies when I was growing up.
[01:49:34.770 --> 01:49:35.610]  I used to make fun of them.
[01:49:35.930 --> 01:49:36.410]  But you know what?
[01:49:36.430 --> 01:49:40.212]  There's something they said during the Vietnam War, which rings true right now.
[01:49:40.572 --> 01:49:46.075]  What they used to say is, hey man, what if they gave a war and nobody came?
[01:49:46.991 --> 01:49:47.291]  You know?
[01:49:47.831 --> 01:49:50.992]  Well, that philosophy is cogent right now.
[01:49:51.052 --> 01:49:52.272]  Yeah, we just say, screw you!
[01:49:52.312 --> 01:49:53.873]  We're not going along with your crap.
[01:49:54.073 --> 01:49:55.433]  We don't buy anything you say.
[01:49:55.473 --> 01:49:56.253]  Yeah, just forget it.
[01:49:56.353 --> 01:50:00.974]  What if you declare a totalitarian state and nobody shows up?
[01:50:01.554 --> 01:50:01.774]  You know?
[01:50:02.115 --> 01:50:06.896]  Massive civil disobedience by the police, state officials, local officials.
[01:50:07.076 --> 01:50:08.336]  Just forget it, man!
[01:50:08.776 --> 01:50:12.457]  Go find your own totalitarian state somewhere else and get the heck out of ours.
[01:50:12.537 --> 01:50:15.040]  Then the feds will stage a bombing, but we expose them.
[01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:15.960]  Exactly.
[01:50:16.081 --> 01:50:19.244]  I mean, you know, what they do is they carrot and stick you with all their nonsense.
[01:50:19.264 --> 01:50:23.828]  They'll say, here, have this program, you get a bunch of money, and if you won't do what we say, we're going to yank your money.
[01:50:24.009 --> 01:50:25.070]  Just get off of their tit!
[01:50:27.918 --> 01:50:29.678]  Well said, Vice Ray Gunray.
[01:50:29.738 --> 01:50:30.098]  Thank you.
[01:50:30.939 --> 01:50:32.259]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:33.579 --> 01:50:34.899]  We're going to be back in a moment.
[01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:35.520]  Thanks, Scholar.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.220]  And we're going to bring up Mike Rivera.
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:39.300]  He'll keep bobbing here with us about 30 minutes as well.
[01:50:39.681 --> 01:50:45.902]  And then later, are there really microphones and cameras in Magnavox converters for digital?
[01:50:48.722 --> 01:50:53.583]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:53.603 --> 01:50:55.284]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:57.961 --> 01:50:59.522]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:59.642 --> 01:51:04.223]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:51:04.383 --> 01:51:07.144]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:51:07.344 --> 01:51:10.205]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:51:10.385 --> 01:51:15.107]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:51:15.347 --> 01:51:16.268]  If you simply prepare.
[01:51:16.468 --> 01:51:19.410]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:19.711 --> 01:51:26.616]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:51:26.716 --> 01:51:29.819]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:51:29.979 --> 01:51:31.860]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[01:51:35.123 --> 01:51:41.209]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-stride, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:51:41.389 --> 01:51:45.133]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:51:45.153 --> 01:51:46.635]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:51:46.675 --> 01:51:47.115]  Take action today.
[01:51:47.135 --> 01:51:48.957]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:52:00.569 --> 01:52:02.470]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:52:02.951 --> 01:52:05.733]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:52:39.142 --> 01:52:42.885]  We are now into the fourth and final hour.
[01:52:44.045 --> 01:52:46.827]  Mike Rivero joins us from Hawaii.
[01:52:48.188 --> 01:52:48.569]  Aloha!
[01:52:48.589 --> 01:52:56.494]  We've got him on the webcam simulcasting with us up at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:52:58.815 --> 01:53:02.658]  And we also have Bob Dacey here in studio with us.
[01:53:05.526 --> 01:53:10.308]  Bob, we're going to punch him back up on the webcam here in just a moment.
[01:53:10.368 --> 01:53:15.489]  Before we go to Mike Rivera and continue with the phone calls, how do you think this Obama thing is going to end?
[01:53:15.529 --> 01:53:18.891]  I mean, Bush was their puppet, carried through their agenda, became very unpopular.
[01:53:19.551 --> 01:53:23.552]  He's a horrible little creature, but at the same time just a puppet nonetheless.
[01:53:23.592 --> 01:53:24.993]  You know, puppet on the left, puppet on the right.
[01:53:25.033 --> 01:53:25.993]  Gee, I like this puppet.
[01:53:26.873 --> 01:53:27.834]  As a famous comedian,
[01:53:28.954 --> 01:53:37.257]  Bill Hicks like to say, I do see a lot of the Obama people, the Obama people that aren't complete sheep, starting to wake up.
[01:53:37.277 --> 01:53:40.078]  But some of them are just bleeding even more angrily.
[01:53:40.098 --> 01:53:41.299]  Obama!
[01:53:41.659 --> 01:53:42.239]  Obama!
[01:53:42.539 --> 01:53:44.200]  And it was on the news yesterday that
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:49.704]  The Obamanoids are running around pulling off conservative stickers, going after people, getting aggressive.
[01:53:50.065 --> 01:53:52.206]  Police are harassing people with anti-Obama stickers.
[01:53:52.226 --> 01:53:55.229]  We know in Missouri, police went on the news and said, don't talk bad about Obama.
[01:53:55.649 --> 01:53:58.011]  We'll decide if it's a lie or not and arrest you.
[01:53:58.071 --> 01:54:00.293]  That was on the news during the campaign.
[01:54:00.694 --> 01:54:04.237]  I think it depends on how stupid people have been, how stupid people are, really.
[01:54:04.537 --> 01:54:09.221]  I mean, through efforts, your efforts, there's more and more people that aren't stupid.
[01:54:09.661 --> 01:54:10.982]  And I think it depends on
[01:54:12.103 --> 01:54:14.405]  How many of them can still think?
[01:54:15.345 --> 01:54:19.028]  And I think, look at the Ron Paul campaign, there's millions of young people that can still think.
[01:54:20.008 --> 01:54:21.269]  And they can keep spreading the word.
[01:54:21.469 --> 01:54:24.531]  And I think that this thing's going to fail one way or the other.
[01:54:24.591 --> 01:54:26.212]  Obama's going to be exposed as a fraud.
[01:54:26.973 --> 01:54:30.775]  And I think it'll be quicker, I think, than George Bush.
[01:54:31.316 --> 01:54:33.737]  Just because the lies are just coming.
[01:54:34.918 --> 01:54:37.820]  He's promised so much, and he's going to deliver nothing.
[01:54:38.737 --> 01:54:46.480]  And as the economy collapses, that's what really makes people wake up, is when they don't have anything to eat, or their paycheck gets cut or whatever.
[01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:58.865]  They're going to be looking for somebody to blame, and since he's the guy sitting up there, even though he's nothing but a puppet, and since the economy continues to collapse, and because they are collapsing the economy on purpose, he's going to take the heat.
[01:54:58.985 --> 01:55:10.294]  But that's what the elite want, is that the Obama supporters and the rest of the people fighting with each other, Obama's saying, look, you didn't get behind my plan, that's why things are getting worse, and everybody focuses on Obama instead of the power behind the throne.
[01:55:10.594 --> 01:55:13.677]  You know, I want to do something in here live on TV, because this is crazy.
[01:55:13.697 --> 01:55:16.079]  We've got two different crews in here and a bunch of folks out there.
[01:55:16.279 --> 01:55:25.366]  Guys, rotate this camera around right here and show the boom mic and some of the stuff, and rotate this camera over here around and kind of get the back shot of this fellow with the big camera here.
[01:55:25.406 --> 01:55:25.867]  This is cool.
[01:55:29.089 --> 01:55:30.029]  What's going on in here?
[01:55:30.809 --> 01:55:33.251]  And plus, people keep wanting to get a tour of the new studios.
[01:55:33.411 --> 01:55:47.217]  I'm so busy finishing the Obama Deception, literally working 18 hours a day many days, most days about 16 and a half, 17, not counting transit time, that I haven't had time to shoot video of the studio to give people an idea.
[01:55:47.257 --> 01:55:50.639]  But I also want to do a video tour of the entire office.
[01:55:50.659 --> 01:55:55.961]  Maybe we should hook up a camera with a wireless unit someday so I can just do it live, like Bill O'Reilly says.
[01:55:56.161 --> 01:55:57.042]  Let's do it live!
[01:56:00.087 --> 01:56:00.908]  I've seen that clip.
[01:56:01.148 --> 01:56:02.089]  You've seen that clip, guys?
[01:56:03.731 --> 01:56:07.435]  On him on Extra or whatever it was, or Current Affair, whatever it was, I don't remember.
[01:56:08.216 --> 01:56:10.999]  But a lot of stuff going on in here.
[01:56:11.019 --> 01:56:14.803]  We're about to go to break here, but let's go ahead and bring up Mike Rivero.
[01:56:15.203 --> 01:56:16.665]  Hey, Mike, how's it going?
[01:56:16.725 --> 01:56:17.906]  Aloha there, my friend.
[01:56:18.783 --> 01:56:21.045]  Aloha Nui Nui, how's it going over there?
[01:56:21.646 --> 01:56:24.028]  Oh good man, this is exciting here.
[01:56:24.948 --> 01:56:37.899]  When we come back I want you to talk about the alternative media and how it's exploding and displacing the mainstream corporate horror media and how they're striking back with internet too and now making the announcements that they're going to have the FCC regulate our speech on the web.
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:39.601]  Tell us what we can politically say.
[01:56:39.681 --> 01:56:41.963]  Canada's announcing it and I want to get your take Bob.
[01:56:43.328 --> 01:56:53.092]  And we will continue with your phone calls straight ahead with Mike Rivero, Bob Dacey, the Australian film crew, and the Independent Film Channel.
[01:56:53.772 --> 01:57:03.735]  And the Independent Film Channel is separately doing a little piece here, but they've got a film called The New World Order coming out, with yours truly on my heels, coming out in a few months on IFC as well.
[01:57:04.096 --> 01:57:06.596]  And it's the fairest documentary I've ever seen from the mainstream media.
[01:57:06.997 --> 01:57:07.937]  So maybe they're good guys.
[01:57:08.417 --> 01:57:11.799]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:57:11.939 --> 01:57:17.161]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:57:17.341 --> 01:57:22.124]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:57:22.504 --> 01:57:33.609]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:57:34.009 --> 01:57:39.574]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:57:39.794 --> 01:57:45.859]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:57:46.059 --> 01:57:46.699]  What about you?

[01:58:07.892 --> 01:58:14.274]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:14.634 --> 01:58:16.295]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:58:17.273 --> 01:58:18.294]  But who is the enemy?
[01:58:18.815 --> 01:58:19.335]  Bin Laden.
[01:58:19.615 --> 01:58:20.617]  This is his ammo.
[01:58:20.637 --> 01:58:21.918]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:58:21.998 --> 01:58:23.640]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:58:23.980 --> 01:58:30.747]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:58:31.127 --> 01:58:31.568]  Some U.S.
[01:58:31.628 --> 01:58:37.254]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:58:37.954 --> 01:58:41.495]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:58:41.835 --> 01:58:51.698]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:58:51.938 --> 01:58:52.678]  Fabled enemies.
[01:58:53.158 --> 01:59:00.440]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:04.261]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:59:07.924 --> 01:59:10.865]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:59:11.006 --> 01:59:16.248]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:59:16.528 --> 01:59:21.891]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:59:22.251 --> 01:59:23.371]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:59:23.732 --> 01:59:32.636]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:59:33.056 --> 01:59:34.678]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:59:34.878 --> 01:59:39.063]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[01:59:39.103 --> 01:59:43.728]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[02:00:01.609 --> 02:00:02.670]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[02:00:11.369 --> 02:00:12.049]  America has been hijacked.
[02:00:12.250 --> 02:00:12.550]  Not by Al-Qaeda.
[02:00:12.750 --> 02:00:13.370]  Not by Bin Laden.
[02:00:13.510 --> 02:00:14.170]  But by a group of tyrants.
[02:00:14.190 --> 02:00:20.872]  That should be of great concern to all Americans.
[02:00:24.393 --> 02:00:38.397]  You still think that share fuel brought down the world trade center?
[02:00:42.995 --> 02:00:55.070]  If the government has nothing to hide, why are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
[02:01:18.260 --> 02:01:19.242]  We are back live.
[02:01:19.262 --> 02:01:22.489]  That's Ministry with cutting in clips from Loose Change.
[02:01:23.612 --> 02:01:25.676]  Of course, we produce Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:01:26.919 --> 02:01:28.282]  Check it out for free on the web.
[02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:33.942]  We are overthrowing the enemy's paradigm.
[02:01:34.242 --> 02:01:38.404]  The new renaissance is upon us, and so the establishment is moving quickly.
[02:01:38.424 --> 02:01:50.029]  The Toronto Star, the New York Times have announced the last two days they are going to shut down the old web and have a gated, safe community, as the New York Times said, taking your freedoms for your safety.
[02:01:50.269 --> 02:01:51.410]  These are quotes
[02:01:52.409 --> 02:01:56.152]  The truth is these corporate whores are in trouble and they know it and I got news for them.
[02:01:56.172 --> 02:01:57.654]  You could shut the web down today.
[02:01:58.294 --> 02:02:00.556]  That will make people desperately seek out the truth.
[02:02:01.488 --> 02:02:02.328]  That much faster.
[02:02:02.729 --> 02:02:09.912]  And I know that the fastest way to make tyrants fall, as Mike Rivera says, is to make them act like dictators.
[02:02:10.452 --> 02:02:11.533]  And that's certainly what's happening.
[02:02:11.833 --> 02:02:13.874]  Mike Rivera from Hawaii, good to have you with us.
[02:02:13.974 --> 02:02:27.160]  I would like you to break down, for the listeners, your take on what's happening with this war between the exploding diverse alternative media and the dying dinosaur lie, lie, lie, lie, lies, lies, lies filled corporate whore press.
[02:02:28.459 --> 02:02:31.003]  Well, I think you basically hit the nail right on the head.
[02:02:31.023 --> 02:02:38.073]  The corporate media and their government associates realize they're losing control over the minds of America and the minds of the world.
[02:02:38.353 --> 02:02:40.176]  They're trying very hard to regain it.
[02:02:40.516 --> 02:02:41.838]  I don't think they can succeed.
[02:02:41.959 --> 02:02:44.763]  In fact, on my own show, I like to draw the parallel.
[02:02:45.203 --> 02:02:45.984]  We're good to go.
[02:03:04.677 --> 02:03:05.278]  We're good to go.
[02:03:21.789 --> 02:03:21.989]  I think?
[02:03:36.927 --> 02:03:37.268]  Thank you.
[02:03:58.334 --> 02:04:13.269]  I think it accelerates the rebellion and really makes it obvious for people when they come out and say, I mean, this is the senator over the committee and the FCC saying they're going to shut down freedom of speech on the web and they're trying to sell that to the public to keep us safe?
[02:04:13.389 --> 02:04:14.651]  I mean, this is ridiculous!
[02:04:15.814 --> 02:04:20.978]  Oh, they're trying to categorize it in terms of like child pornography or the threat of terrorists.
[02:04:21.258 --> 02:04:34.328]  But you know, it's amazing if you look at the fall of the Soviet Union and how hard they worked to close down the Simons dot, which was a network of fax machines that was sharing the truth across the old Soviet Union.
[02:04:34.609 --> 02:04:38.972]  And the harder the Soviets tried to shut that down, the more people were plugging into it.
[02:04:39.332 --> 02:04:40.673]  Because people want the truth.
[02:04:40.713 --> 02:04:42.615]  They're going to go where the truth is going to be found.
[02:04:42.875 --> 02:04:52.223]  And that is why the audience has shifted over to the blogs and the alternative radio, and why every day we hear newspapers are having to trim staff, TV stations are letting people go.
[02:04:52.603 --> 02:04:53.724]  They're losing their audience.
[02:04:53.784 --> 02:04:57.007]  The audience is coming over here because, as you said before,
[02:04:57.848 --> 02:04:59.930]  Americans know the media has been lying to them.
[02:05:00.190 --> 02:05:01.291]  Nobody likes a liar.
[02:05:01.752 --> 02:05:04.514]  We've been proven right time after time after time again.
[02:05:04.835 --> 02:05:11.140]  The audience is coming over to us, and if they try and impose a gated community, people are going to find ways around the gates.
[02:05:11.180 --> 02:05:12.582]  They already tried to do this in China.
[02:05:12.942 --> 02:05:14.043]  It didn't work.
[02:05:14.323 --> 02:05:15.985]  People found ways around the gates.
[02:05:16.025 --> 02:05:16.966]  They went through proxies.
[02:05:17.026 --> 02:05:20.189]  Whatever means it takes, they get through to where the truth can be found.
[02:05:20.589 --> 02:05:27.417]  And the corporate controlled press has been trying to demonize the internet and scare people and it's not working.
[02:05:28.058 --> 02:05:29.699]  And they want to control their content.
[02:05:29.739 --> 02:05:30.480]  They want to hoard.
[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:32.663]  Whereas we, with our content, it's free.
[02:05:32.763 --> 02:05:33.744]  We want people to have it.
[02:05:33.784 --> 02:05:34.565]  We have a mission.
[02:05:35.045 --> 02:05:38.670]  And so by it's very nature, they are handicapped and so they're now...
[02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:40.030]  It's incredible.
[02:05:40.050 --> 02:05:45.213]  I didn't think it would come this soon to have literally hundreds of newspapers announcing, we need to shut the internet down.
[02:05:45.253 --> 02:05:47.294]  We need to only have a few thousand channels.
[02:05:47.354 --> 02:05:59.680]  And the Toronto Star had their government board saying, there's a lot of free entertainment news on the web now, but we need to give them carefully crafted information for society, and we need to shut it down.
[02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:01.761]  I mean, this is pathetic.
[02:06:01.801 --> 02:06:07.804]  And I heard Bill Press, the fake liberal, going, we need to shut down talk radio and put me on more stations.
[02:06:08.644 --> 02:06:10.065]  Make people listen to me.
[02:06:10.085 --> 02:06:12.267]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[02:06:12.287 --> 02:06:15.469]  And they claim it's to shut down, you know, tools like Limbaugh.
[02:06:15.489 --> 02:06:17.210]  That guy's discredited a million years ago.
[02:06:17.991 --> 02:06:18.731]  It's not for that.
[02:06:19.012 --> 02:06:30.220]  If you watch the Violent Radicalization Act hearings in Congress, it is to shut people like Bob Dacey and Mike Rivero and Alex Jones and InfoWars.com and TheSimpleTruth.com and WhatReallyHappened.com down.
[02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:31.481]  And you're right.
[02:06:31.541 --> 02:06:34.823]  People now got a taste for truth and information and alternative information.
[02:06:35.143 --> 02:06:36.424]  And so it's not going to work.
[02:06:36.744 --> 02:06:37.545]  Pandora's box.
[02:06:37.885 --> 02:06:38.866]  No, SymbolTruth.net, by the way.
[02:06:38.906 --> 02:06:39.246]  SymbolTruth.net.
[02:06:39.266 --> 02:06:40.588]  Make that correction.
[02:06:56.983 --> 02:06:58.424]  Now listen, I know one thing.
[02:06:58.924 --> 02:07:06.088]  The guys that are in the legislature, you know, the congressmen, the senators, they vote however they figure is going to lie in their pocket whenever they can get away with it.
[02:07:06.288 --> 02:07:09.049]  Or whatever they feel is in their best selfish best interest.
[02:07:09.289 --> 02:07:11.771]  When the public is not looking, they do whatever the heck they want.
[02:07:12.571 --> 02:07:15.773]  But what percentage of the American people use the internet every day?
[02:07:16.133 --> 02:07:17.334]  It's humongous, right?
[02:07:17.694 --> 02:07:23.237]  But now, you go messing with their internet, they are going to scream bloody murder, and the politicians are going to go,
[02:07:23.857 --> 02:07:24.518]  Oh, they woke up?
[02:07:24.538 --> 02:07:25.799]  And they're going to have some problems.
[02:07:25.819 --> 02:07:27.900]  They're going to have some problems passing this garbage.
[02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:34.225]  That's why they're incrementally coming in with ending net neutrality, taxing the web, regulating it, controlling it.
[02:07:34.385 --> 02:07:39.309]  But I want to show people what we do here on air, since we have a lot of media here, especially from Australia.
[02:07:39.489 --> 02:07:50.158]  I want you guys to Google in the control room right now, Communist Chinese style net censorship
[02:07:51.601 --> 02:07:52.922]  Proposed for Australia.
[02:07:53.102 --> 02:07:54.263]  I believe that's the exact headline.
[02:07:54.283 --> 02:07:55.023]  It was all over the news.
[02:07:55.383 --> 02:07:56.544]  There, they just admitted it.
[02:07:56.624 --> 02:08:01.187]  They've been saying, we're banning all protests and if you do protest, we'll arrest you as a terrorist.
[02:08:01.207 --> 02:08:02.127]  People still come out and protest.
[02:08:02.147 --> 02:08:10.352]  Then they say, yes, we are going to shut the web down to only a few, this is in the news there, a few thousand sites that we say are safe.
[02:08:10.412 --> 02:08:15.935]  And they use the excuse of, there's people teaching folks how to commit suicide on the web and there's pornography and this and that.
[02:08:15.955 --> 02:08:20.518]  But then they admit it's political sites and hate sites, anybody that covers this,
[02:08:21.218 --> 02:08:22.421]  And see, that's another thing we do.
[02:08:22.541 --> 02:08:28.553]  We cover and track and analyze and critique a lot of mainstream media.
[02:08:29.488 --> 02:08:40.135]  But before, it's always global media, the nightly news, the same stories on ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, in the same order with the same Prozac and ads on there.
[02:08:41.015 --> 02:08:43.977]  I mean, not just the same programming in the same order, the same ads on there.
[02:08:43.997 --> 02:08:48.000]  You've got a Viagra ad, you've got a Prozac ad, you've got some, you know... Prilosec?
[02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:48.961]  Exactly.
[02:08:49.281 --> 02:08:55.065]  You've got all these ads on there, it's the same thing, but what we do is we'll take a local news story,
[02:08:56.095 --> 02:08:58.376]  That wasn't mainstream news and make it international.
[02:08:59.196 --> 02:09:04.457]  We will take a foreign news story to where Australia goes, yeah, we're doing what England and the US are doing.
[02:09:04.477 --> 02:09:06.818]  We're going to shut the web down to a few thousand sites.
[02:09:07.218 --> 02:09:10.359]  It's Chinese communist style internet censorship, but it's for your own good.
[02:09:10.639 --> 02:09:14.140]  And we'll go see they admit what they're doing in Australia.
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:16.281]  So because we have an Australian film crew, did you find it?
[02:09:18.151 --> 02:09:20.092]  Because I want to punch it up on screen for people.
[02:09:20.752 --> 02:09:23.973]  Here it is, Australian Implement Mandatory Internet Censorship.
[02:09:24.253 --> 02:09:31.615]  That's the Herald Sun up on screen right now for everybody, but that's not the exact one I want.
[02:09:32.196 --> 02:09:38.698]  Now there's another one that says Chinese style, it may say Chinese instead of Communist Chinese, Chinese style net censorship for Australia.
[02:09:39.358 --> 02:09:45.279]  Chinese-style net censorship for Australia, or Australia to have Chinese-style net censorship.
[02:09:45.299 --> 02:09:49.680]  I believe one of those is the exact headline, and you can pull that up.
[02:09:50.300 --> 02:09:57.682]  Before, I would just say that on radio and link to the story on InfoWars.com for folks to go see it, and people would, you know, on YouTube post my videos.
[02:09:57.702 --> 02:09:58.442]  That's just made up.
[02:09:58.482 --> 02:09:59.302]  He just made that up.
[02:09:59.622 --> 02:10:04.923]  Now, because we're simulcasting video, I can throw the sucker on screen, I can do a Google search, I can say,
[02:10:06.147 --> 02:10:14.856]  Thousands of government and university studies show that watching more than an hour of TV a day causes massive brain damage because the brain goes into a sleep state and no longer connects new neural pathways.
[02:10:16.498 --> 02:10:22.744]  And then they can Google that and tens of thousands of the articles and studies pop up and I can click on them and show people.
[02:10:23.843 --> 02:10:27.446]  See, so the mainstream media, a lot of this stuff's actually there.
[02:10:27.886 --> 02:10:30.769]  It's just people, we aggregate it and bring it all together.
[02:10:30.789 --> 02:10:31.049]  Look at that.
[02:10:31.289 --> 02:10:34.411]  Australia to follow Chinese, China net censorship.
[02:10:35.152 --> 02:10:36.793]  And what publication is that out of?
[02:10:37.774 --> 02:10:42.518]  That's out of the, something today, I can't read it from this distance, the URL.
[02:10:43.358 --> 02:10:44.079]  What's the URL?
[02:10:45.420 --> 02:10:46.601]  I want to know what newspaper that is.
[02:10:46.621 --> 02:10:48.082]  I know it was all over their major newspapers.
[02:10:49.303 --> 02:10:49.583]  Alright.
[02:10:50.976 --> 02:10:53.459]  And that's a blog reporting on a mainstream news story.
[02:10:54.660 --> 02:10:56.963]  Your comments on this, Mike Rivera.
[02:10:58.263 --> 02:11:02.886]  Well, it's a panic reaction, and we've actually been seeing this for a very, very long time.
[02:11:02.946 --> 02:11:18.198]  I remember back when I was first starting WhatReallyHappened.com, we had the infamous Exxon amendment, and that was actually preceded by the disgorgement of large amounts of really ugly pornography all over the Internet.
[02:11:18.798 --> 02:11:22.601]  Back then, most communication between people was done through something called Usenet.
[02:11:23.401 --> 02:11:50.528]  Which was used news groups and some were moderated and some were not and the unmoderated ones were basically where you went for anything that you know that your taste went to but somebody was spamming the entire Usenet groups with pornography that was going into cooking groups it was going into crocheting groups and it was just really ugly we couldn't get him to stop and I remember at the time saying I think something is up somebody is seeding the stuff on there and sure enough Usenet got shut down last year
[02:11:51.917 --> 02:11:54.718]  And that was clearly the Feds planting that on there.
[02:11:55.039 --> 02:11:57.820]  So be aware of the operations they run.
[02:11:57.860 --> 02:12:00.341]  We'll come back with Mike Rivero and Bob Daisy.
[02:12:00.361 --> 02:12:02.942]  Let's just take you guys to the end and take phone calls.
[02:12:03.122 --> 02:12:06.684]  And Bob's got a question for Mike Rivero.
[02:12:06.744 --> 02:12:07.905]  A meme question.
[02:12:08.545 --> 02:12:11.806]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:12:11.986 --> 02:12:16.047]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:12:16.247 --> 02:12:27.670]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[02:12:27.890 --> 02:12:33.711]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[02:12:33.831 --> 02:12:34.271]  I think so.
[02:12:57.474 --> 02:13:03.156]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[02:13:03.176 --> 02:13:07.217]  I've come with a message of information!
[02:13:07.237 --> 02:13:14.559]  9-11 was an inside job!
[02:13:14.619 --> 02:13:16.680]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:18.301]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:13:18.401 --> 02:13:21.221]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:13:21.281 --> 02:13:26.083]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, the UNESCO?
[02:13:34.549 --> 02:13:39.438]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:41.870]  Inside job?
[02:13:43.211 --> 02:13:45.492]  How dare you?
[02:13:45.853 --> 02:13:50.735]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:13:50.895 --> 02:13:53.376]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:13:53.437 --> 02:13:59.800]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[02:14:09.582 --> 02:14:11.564]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[02:14:11.945 --> 02:14:17.911]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[02:14:46.272 --> 02:14:47.373]  Experience the Difference.
[02:15:07.853 --> 02:15:12.436]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[02:15:12.776 --> 02:15:19.961]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[02:15:20.221 --> 02:15:21.602]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[02:15:21.842 --> 02:15:25.725]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[02:15:25.985 --> 02:15:29.568]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[02:15:29.828 --> 02:15:33.850]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[02:15:37.793 --> 02:15:38.133]  I think so.
[02:16:12.193 --> 02:16:15.178]  No, uh, Bob Desi loves Mike Rivera.
[02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:20.667]  And, uh, you know, just like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts was...
[02:16:22.105 --> 02:16:27.107]  Saying people basically had to vote for Obama because we had to repudiate Bush's torture, secret arrest, our image in the world.
[02:16:27.507 --> 02:16:31.248]  I knew it was going to be a bait and switch because of his advisors and what he'd done in the past.
[02:16:31.728 --> 02:16:36.490]  But, you know, Mike said that if he didn't do what he said he was going to do, he'd go after him and he has been going after him.
[02:16:36.650 --> 02:16:38.791]  And I was joking when I said it was a mean question.
[02:16:39.371 --> 02:16:43.272]  Bob Dacey, address your question from Austin, Texas to Honolulu.
[02:16:43.592 --> 02:16:44.693]  Okay, Mike, how you doing?
[02:16:45.473 --> 02:16:46.393]  I'm doing just fine.
[02:16:46.553 --> 02:16:46.993]  That's great.
[02:16:47.013 --> 02:16:48.334]  This is not a mean question.
[02:16:48.354 --> 02:16:51.714]  This is just a good, intellectual, journalistic question, okay?
[02:16:52.175 --> 02:16:56.596]  I go to WhatReallyHappened.com every single day to see what really happened in the world.
[02:16:56.616 --> 02:16:59.256]  I also go to Infowars.com every single day.
[02:16:59.656 --> 02:17:02.577]  Those are my two super reliable internet sources.
[02:17:02.597 --> 02:17:03.897]  Ah, Keyboard Wars!
[02:17:04.957 --> 02:17:05.197]  What?
[02:17:05.858 --> 02:17:06.418]  It's made up.
[02:17:07.938 --> 02:17:08.359]  Whatever.
[02:17:08.419 --> 02:17:11.363]  Anyway, that's where I go to know what's going on.
[02:17:12.364 --> 02:17:24.880]  But I have a question for you because I was puzzled about your editorial comment during the election that you seem to want to give Barack Obama the benefit of the doubt.
[02:17:25.794 --> 02:17:26.374]  All the time?
[02:17:26.754 --> 02:17:31.616]  And while I watched that, I said, you know, Rivero knows what's going on.
[02:17:31.816 --> 02:17:33.197]  Why is he doing that?
[02:17:33.217 --> 02:17:41.139]  And I was just wondering what your comment about that is to why you were giving Barack Obama the benefit of the doubt during the election campaign.
[02:17:42.660 --> 02:17:48.002]  Well, unfortunately, I was one of the people who wanted Ron Paul, to be very honest, to be in office.
[02:17:48.863 --> 02:17:56.127]  Yeah, and when it came down to a choice between McCain and Obama, my preference went to Obama, but it was a marginal preference at best.
[02:17:56.487 --> 02:18:07.354]  And the only reason I gave Obama the benefit of the doubt was because when he first started his campaign, he was saying a lot of the things that made more sense, certainly, than John McCain did.
[02:18:08.294 --> 02:18:11.275]  Then, as he moved centrists, I began to have some real serious doubts.
[02:18:11.955 --> 02:18:24.239]  What I was thinking might be the case, and the reason why I said, I'm going to look at Obama as marginally preferable to John McCain, is that he might turn out to be another Jack Kennedy.
[02:18:24.259 --> 02:18:35.163]  Now, as you know, John Kennedy got into office and he basically said, okay, I've got the job, I'm going to do it the way I think it should be done, and not as I'm being told to do it by all the people who supported me.
[02:18:35.763 --> 02:18:39.726]  And I was thinking Obama might be of that ilk, but sadly, that has not come to pass.
[02:18:39.766 --> 02:18:42.928]  And I'm probably as disappointed in him as just about anybody else.
[02:18:42.968 --> 02:18:46.390]  And as Alex Jones pointed out, yeah, I'm going after Barack Obama now.
[02:18:46.810 --> 02:18:49.612]  He's surrounded himself with a bunch of Clinton appointees.
[02:18:50.212 --> 02:18:53.334]  He is doing, I think, everything wrong regarding the economy.
[02:18:53.374 --> 02:19:02.980]  I'm even beginning to think that Alex Jones may be correct in that this is a deliberate takedown, because I can't imagine there is that much stupidity in the Obama administration.
[02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:04.481]  It has to be by design.
[02:19:05.794 --> 02:19:12.779]  Yeah, I mean, he was saying he was going to end the war day one, then it was six months, eighteen months, now twenty-three months, and, you know, that's why a lot of people didn't support him.
[02:19:12.799 --> 02:19:15.741]  But, you know, I mean, here's Mike saying he got suckered, I mean, you know.
[02:19:16.701 --> 02:19:19.023]  Yeah, well, you know, that's an honest answer, though.
[02:19:19.143 --> 02:19:20.784]  That's a good, that's an honest answer, you know.
[02:19:22.125 --> 02:19:22.925]  I wanted to find out.
[02:19:23.105 --> 02:19:23.926]  Bob J.C.
[02:19:23.986 --> 02:19:25.807]  also moonlights as an inquisitor.
[02:19:26.107 --> 02:19:32.552]  Well, hey, you know, look, look, Alex, you know darn well that the mainstream media will not ask any tough question to anybody.
[02:19:32.972 --> 02:19:35.573]  You know, they literally kiss the hind end of these people.
[02:19:36.034 --> 02:19:46.800]  You know, like a few years ago up in Georgetown, when your crew was up there in Georgetown talking to Thomas Kean, and I was up there for my TV show talking to Thomas Kean, the chairman of the 9-1-1 Commission.
[02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:50.562]  I mean, the mainstream media was in the room, and they were kissing his hind end.
[02:19:51.182 --> 02:19:52.323]  Oh please, oh please, sir!
[02:19:52.543 --> 02:19:54.304]  Tell us how to save ourselves from the terrorists!
[02:19:54.424 --> 02:19:55.424]  Lord Kean!
[02:19:55.504 --> 02:19:57.666]  Yeah, and so who clobbered him with the real questions?
[02:19:57.806 --> 02:19:58.826]  I did and your people did.
[02:19:59.407 --> 02:20:00.907]  You know, we're the real media now.
[02:20:01.248 --> 02:20:01.568]  Not them.
[02:20:02.298 --> 02:20:03.499]  What about Lord Keene?
[02:20:03.519 --> 02:20:05.660]  Yeah, Lord Keene, Mr. CFR member.
[02:20:06.140 --> 02:20:06.340]  Yeah.
[02:20:07.080 --> 02:20:08.821]  That's actually in Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:20:09.441 --> 02:20:10.242]  Good information.
[02:20:12.503 --> 02:20:16.145]  How fast will the honeymoon wear off, do you think, Mike Rivera, with Lord Obama?
[02:20:16.465 --> 02:20:19.006]  Because I am seeing some of the Obamanoids wake up.
[02:20:20.400 --> 02:20:21.501]  It's gone already.
[02:20:21.661 --> 02:20:23.602]  I think his numbers are already in decline.
[02:20:23.682 --> 02:20:27.524]  I think the fact that he's doing everything wrong regarding the economy.
[02:20:28.485 --> 02:20:35.429]  I mean, the stock market's heading down again today in response to his latest plan to try and fix the mortgages.
[02:20:35.529 --> 02:20:37.951]  People are realizing it's not going to work.
[02:20:38.391 --> 02:20:40.772]  It's politically crafted.
[02:20:40.952 --> 02:20:42.033]  It is not practical.
[02:20:42.153 --> 02:20:43.034]  It is not economic.
[02:20:43.114 --> 02:20:46.916]  I think the problem that a lot of people are realizing is we have a government and a corporate culture
[02:20:47.336 --> 02:21:07.004]  That consists almost entirely of lawyers and accountants so they're trying to solve America's problems with creative bookkeeping and juggling the rules and they don't really know how to get our economy back on track and I really do think that we're in this the phase of our history where the government is looting the nation putting it in their own pocket and they're just gonna let it collapse.
[02:21:07.344 --> 02:21:08.345]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:21:08.365 --> 02:21:11.147]  But more than that, bring us now into a world government superbank.
[02:21:11.167 --> 02:21:12.369]  I want to talk to you about that when we get back.
[02:21:12.389 --> 02:21:15.151]  But this nation had a bad case of the Bushoids.
[02:21:15.551 --> 02:21:17.533]  Now we've got a really bad case of the Obamanoids.
[02:21:17.954 --> 02:21:20.616]  And I think, you know, Preparation H won't fix it.
[02:21:21.076 --> 02:21:24.139]  So I think now people are finally going, man, this is uncomfortable.
[02:21:24.619 --> 02:21:26.901]  I mean, this Obamanoid is bad.
[02:21:27.582 --> 02:21:28.062]  It's big.
[02:21:28.783 --> 02:21:34.869]  It's a serious problem here, so we'll come back and talk more about how we get rid of the Obamanoid problem.
[02:21:35.450 --> 02:21:38.092]  And do all these people want to keep being supporters of Obamanoid?
[02:21:39.734 --> 02:21:40.334]  Sounds painful.
[02:21:40.735 --> 02:21:41.656]  Do you like that analogy?
[02:21:41.696 --> 02:21:42.717]  Oh, it's a great analogy.
[02:21:43.778 --> 02:21:51.265]  It's ridiculous, juvenile, disgusting humor from the mind of Alex Jones and Bob Bates.
[02:21:51.285 --> 02:21:51.585]  But it works.
[02:21:52.682 --> 02:21:55.226]  Mike Rivero is our guest, so is Bob Dacey.
[02:21:55.666 --> 02:21:56.648]  Bob's got to leave us in 10 minutes.
[02:21:56.668 --> 02:21:57.810]  He's got to go back to the hardware store.
[02:21:58.110 --> 02:21:58.991]  We're on the march.
[02:21:59.512 --> 02:22:01.094]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:22:02.036 --> 02:22:04.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:08.354 --> 02:22:12.658]  Rough roads might be ahead for the economy, but your vehicle doesn't have to experience them.
[02:22:12.918 --> 02:22:15.520]  Can't afford a new vehicle or even an expensive repair?
[02:22:15.800 --> 02:22:22.386]  Now you can take care of your vehicle with Protecta Engine Oil Booster by SFR, which is a fully synthetic oil booster.

[02:23:08.234 --> 02:23:14.616]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:23:14.976 --> 02:23:16.636]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:23:17.811 --> 02:23:18.672]  Who is the enemy?
[02:23:19.172 --> 02:23:19.673]  Bin Laden.
[02:23:19.973 --> 02:23:20.974]  This is his M.O.
[02:23:20.994 --> 02:23:22.254]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:23:22.335 --> 02:23:23.996]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:23:24.336 --> 02:23:31.081]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:23:31.481 --> 02:23:31.922]  Some U.S.
[02:23:31.962 --> 02:23:37.606]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:23:38.306 --> 02:23:41.827]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:23:42.128 --> 02:23:44.608]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:24:09.175 --> 02:24:10.416]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[02:24:10.716 --> 02:24:11.876]  eFoods does it again.
[02:24:12.096 --> 02:24:16.898]  The 3-Day Responder provides one adult with three days worth of healthy, delicious, easy-fix food.
[02:24:17.218 --> 02:24:25.361]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.

[02:24:58.327 --> 02:25:00.528]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:25:17.748 --> 02:25:18.809]  We are back live.
[02:25:18.829 --> 02:25:21.550]  Got about 27 minutes left in global transmission.
[02:25:21.570 --> 02:25:23.592]  Then we launch the replay.
[02:25:23.992 --> 02:25:25.193]  What an amazing show today.
[02:25:25.213 --> 02:25:34.998]  We have Alan Watt on, Bob Desi, now Mike Rivero, Australian film crew from National TV, and we have the Independent Film Channel making a separate profile on me.
[02:25:35.939 --> 02:25:42.043]  And then the Independent Film Channel, a couple months, is coming out with a film called The New World Order, the main selection at South by Southwest this year.
[02:25:43.493 --> 02:25:48.596]  And I tell you, it kind of gets scary, Bob, the amount of people we're starting to reach, because I mean, it's just like exponential.
[02:25:48.776 --> 02:25:53.158]  Yeah, but you know the deal is, Alex, the truth sells and you're peddling the truth, man.
[02:25:53.458 --> 02:25:54.739]  And that's just the bottom line.
[02:25:55.019 --> 02:26:03.344]  Yeah, I just feel sorry for all the other, quote, patriot groups and people that got jealous early on of our success, because my goal was to bring a platform for everybody to be on.
[02:26:03.964 --> 02:26:09.007]  There's hundreds of people I don't have on because they're vicious liars and demons, and I watched them destroy themselves.
[02:26:09.747 --> 02:26:10.467]  Because of that.
[02:26:10.608 --> 02:26:12.909]  And it's just so sad in their desperate attempt to stop me.
[02:26:13.249 --> 02:26:14.910]  And I don't think most of them are even government agents.
[02:26:14.990 --> 02:26:17.131]  It's just such a sick society, Bob.
[02:26:17.271 --> 02:26:21.494]  Well, you know, you have natural jealousies in any endeavor.
[02:26:21.614 --> 02:26:24.575]  But the fact of the matter is, you know, I've known you for, what, 11 years now?
[02:26:26.376 --> 02:26:28.478]  And, you know, Alex Jones tells the truth.
[02:26:29.638 --> 02:26:33.301]  He may make it all exciting or something like that, and he gets all excited about it.
[02:26:33.341 --> 02:26:42.206]  It is exciting that bankers have hijacked us and that major newspapers are announcing a giant bank of the world will rule everything and I'm going to pay carbon taxes to them.
[02:26:42.366 --> 02:26:43.267]  That is exciting!
[02:26:43.287 --> 02:26:44.268]  We need to get excited!
[02:26:44.428 --> 02:26:45.088]  Exactly.
[02:26:45.448 --> 02:26:47.450]  But a lot of people use that against you.
[02:26:47.470 --> 02:26:50.632]  So he's flying off the handle or something like that.
[02:26:50.652 --> 02:26:51.052]  But it's true.
[02:26:51.372 --> 02:26:54.414]  How could you not be excited about it when that's all you do is study it?
[02:26:54.554 --> 02:26:57.116]  They've introduced bills to ban all semi-automatics.
[02:26:57.436 --> 02:27:00.598]  They've introduced bills to psychologically register all gun owners.
[02:27:00.858 --> 02:27:05.381]  They've introduced bills to mark all the ammo and track it and make you get a million dollars insurance.
[02:27:05.401 --> 02:27:07.542]  Not just psychologically register all gun owners.
[02:27:07.562 --> 02:27:13.025]  They've introduced a bill that would make you a criminal if you didn't register your old .38 that's been in your house for 15 years.
[02:27:13.265 --> 02:27:14.666]  You could be an automatic felon!
[02:27:14.746 --> 02:27:15.567]  I know, I know, exactly!
[02:27:15.867 --> 02:27:20.510]  Listen, I get on air and describe these gun bills and people email me saying, you're not saying as bad as it is.
[02:27:21.601 --> 02:27:22.963]  I mean, folks, it's happening!
[02:27:23.003 --> 02:27:24.605]  I mean, they're making their move right now!
[02:27:24.865 --> 02:27:27.729]  Yeah, and you know, tyrants hit people with guns.
[02:27:27.889 --> 02:27:29.431]  They were just asking me how I have so much energy.
[02:27:30.392 --> 02:27:31.714]  How would I not have this much energy?
[02:27:31.734 --> 02:27:32.836]  I mean, this is insane!
[02:27:33.156 --> 02:27:37.542]  You didn't take enough Prozac and Ritalin when you were a kid, man.
[02:27:38.650 --> 02:27:39.131]  Or something.
[02:27:39.171 --> 02:27:40.913]  Maybe you didn't drink enough fluoride.
[02:27:40.953 --> 02:27:41.373]  I don't know.
[02:27:41.954 --> 02:27:44.237]  Got too many vaccines.
[02:27:44.277 --> 02:27:51.024]  We just had an ISDN cut out, but we're back on air with our quadruple backups to the satellite uplinks in Houston.
[02:27:51.505 --> 02:27:52.786]  We're here at Cape Canaveral.
[02:27:53.107 --> 02:27:54.308]  Houston is Minnesota.
[02:27:54.628 --> 02:27:56.310]  This is launch site Cape Canaveral.
[02:27:57.389 --> 02:28:00.451]  But we do have a great responsibility as well, like they say in the Spider-Man movie.
[02:28:01.232 --> 02:28:05.074]  Let's go ahead and go back to Mike Rivero.
[02:28:05.134 --> 02:28:06.675]  Mike, there's a lot going on.
[02:28:06.955 --> 02:28:07.696]  How do you see them?
[02:28:07.956 --> 02:28:12.579]  We talked about how they're going to fail, but they are coming at us with Internet 2, admitting that it is to censor the web.
[02:28:12.919 --> 02:28:15.841]  I mean, we need to fight this and get the word out.
[02:28:16.382 --> 02:28:19.604]  They've got hate laws introduced to basically restrict all sorts of speech in the U.S.
[02:28:19.664 --> 02:28:26.188]  They're talking about making it a crime to deny climate, climate denial, associating that with denying the Holocaust.
[02:28:26.228 --> 02:28:26.989]  I mean, it's getting bad.
[02:28:28.030 --> 02:28:29.431]  Yeah, it really is getting bad.
[02:28:29.491 --> 02:28:31.312]  They're talking about climate denial.
[02:28:31.332 --> 02:28:33.214]  They're talking about 9-11 denial.
[02:28:33.734 --> 02:28:37.658]  And all they're really doing is advertising the fact that they're scared.
[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:45.226]  That they can't win the arguments on the basis of facts, logic and science and so they're just going to bludgeon people into believing as they're told.
[02:28:46.107 --> 02:28:53.353]  And I'm rather honored that you quoted me earlier on, the fastest way to bring down a dictator is to get them to act like one where everybody can see it.
[02:28:53.673 --> 02:28:55.195]  And that is what's going on right now.
[02:28:55.475 --> 02:29:02.141]  And you're talking about the audience flooding over to Prison Planet and InfoWars and your radio show and my radio show and so forth and so on.
[02:29:02.781 --> 02:29:12.052]  I've got to tell you, and maybe this is because so many people are losing their jobs, the email to my show has doubled just in the last three weeks to my website.
[02:29:12.132 --> 02:29:13.273]  It's just going through the roof.
[02:29:13.574 --> 02:29:15.075]  The audience numbers are going up for me.
[02:29:15.115 --> 02:29:16.998]  I'm sure they're doing exactly the same for you.
[02:29:17.678 --> 02:29:17.818]  I think?
[02:29:34.475 --> 02:29:36.476]  And, you know, it's like a magician and a trick.
[02:29:36.597 --> 02:29:40.859]  As long as you don't know the trick is going on, you'll admire the pretty lights and say, ooh, it's there.
[02:29:40.899 --> 02:29:44.162]  But once you know something's happened, you can't make yourself forget.
[02:29:44.482 --> 02:29:49.885]  Once you know that there really isn't an Easter Bunny, you can't be coerced to going back to saying, yes, there is one.
[02:29:50.706 --> 02:29:53.368]  And so all these beliefs are falling apart.
[02:29:53.888 --> 02:29:57.270]  I want to get final comments from you, Mike Rivero, but Bob Dacey's got to go.
[02:29:57.290 --> 02:30:02.814]  He's got to go back and run his little hardware store, one of the last independent standalone hardware stores in Austin.
[02:30:03.703 --> 02:30:06.504]  Hey, you know, I'm trying to wait for my bailout, actually, Alex.
[02:30:06.824 --> 02:30:15.227]  I go to the mailbox every day, and I'm trying to get that $500,000 executive compensation minimum check from the government, and then I'll shut up.
[02:30:15.347 --> 02:30:22.510]  You know, I mean, really, because I deserve $500,000, and you know, from those according to their abilities, to those according to their needs.
[02:30:23.010 --> 02:30:27.332]  So, you know, why don't I just go into this thing and wait for my executive conversation.
[02:30:27.372 --> 02:30:30.093]  I promise I won't take any more than $500,000 max.
[02:30:30.133 --> 02:30:30.653]  I promise.
[02:30:31.053 --> 02:30:35.635]  Tell the folks where your little hardware store is in Austin that don't want to go to the big box stores.
[02:30:35.855 --> 02:30:49.701]  Well, you know, we're the local True Value franchise here in Austin and we're at Spotswood Springs Road and 183 in Northwest Austin and we have a hardware store and we make screens and we sell Alex Jones videos and do a little bit of locksmithing and do all kinds of things.
[02:30:49.801 --> 02:30:50.901]  You even sell guns?
[02:30:52.742 --> 02:30:52.962]  Yes sir.
[02:30:53.002 --> 02:30:53.343]  Yes sir.
[02:31:05.001 --> 02:31:09.324]  The problem with the selling of guns right now, Alex, is that they're awful hard to get right now.
[02:31:09.344 --> 02:31:15.268]  But however you can't have the slaves and the serfs having weapons!
[02:31:15.749 --> 02:31:18.691]  Barack the Quack has made everyone want to buy guns.
[02:31:18.731 --> 02:31:20.692]  He's been really good for the gun industry.
[02:31:20.732 --> 02:31:23.274]  Lord Obama is a sensible individual.
[02:31:23.534 --> 02:31:27.877]  Total disarmament of the civilian population under the UNIDIR.
[02:31:28.277 --> 02:31:40.860]  The 2001 July 7th agreement to disarm all civilians for a power monopoly of the state under UN law is the only sensible system if we're going to carry out eugenics against these slaves!
[02:31:41.060 --> 02:31:42.520]  They're rabble scum!
[02:31:42.660 --> 02:31:44.921]  They need to be euthanized immediately!
[02:31:45.201 --> 02:31:47.321]  And how dare them not want to be slaves!
[02:31:47.521 --> 02:31:50.222]  How dare them not want to be in inner city reservations!
[02:31:50.462 --> 02:31:55.183]  How dare them not submit to us and our divine will with geniuses!
[02:31:55.646 --> 02:31:58.427]  And what Alex just said is actually factual.
[02:31:58.467 --> 02:32:09.211]  It was Christoph Carl and Patricia Lewis, Unidir, 2000, in a paper they put out called, uh, Disarming... Taking this military-style weapons away from civilians.
[02:32:09.471 --> 02:32:14.412]  Everything he just joked about right now is actually documented in fact.
[02:32:14.492 --> 02:32:16.493]  Of course we must take all your firearms!
[02:32:16.813 --> 02:32:18.294]  Including the semi-automatic.
[02:32:18.314 --> 02:32:31.565]  How are we going to re-educate you to accept being euthanized if we don't... According to Obama and his people, the right of the people to keep and bear flintlocks shall not be infringed.
[02:32:31.945 --> 02:32:39.732]  And the founding fathers, as you've seen in our FEMA training videos, the police in Kansas City, were terrorists against the crown!
[02:32:39.752 --> 02:32:42.354]  The Second Amendment is a vicious crime!
[02:32:42.894 --> 02:32:43.475]  Absolutely.
[02:32:44.946 --> 02:32:45.968]  How dare you!
[02:32:46.188 --> 02:32:46.849]  How dare you!
[02:32:46.869 --> 02:32:48.412]  I will disarm you immediately!
[02:32:48.773 --> 02:32:49.434]  That man!
[02:32:49.634 --> 02:32:50.796]  That man there laughing!
[02:32:51.077 --> 02:32:51.738]  Seize him!
[02:32:52.039 --> 02:32:53.100]  Seize him!
[02:32:53.281 --> 02:32:55.364]  He has been rude to a lordship!
[02:32:58.112 --> 02:32:59.894]  Mike, would you like to do an English invitation?
[02:33:00.775 --> 02:33:02.277]  No, but I did have a comment here.
[02:33:02.297 --> 02:33:07.904]  There's one positive thing about a flintlock and that is you learn how to place your shots and you don't waste any ammo.
[02:33:08.385 --> 02:33:13.391]  And don't diss the muzzle loaders because we don't have paperwork following our guns around.
[02:33:13.791 --> 02:33:15.614]  And once you learn how to place that shot,
[02:33:16.412 --> 02:33:19.533]  Those old rifles can be very very accurate at a distance.
[02:33:20.954 --> 02:33:28.957]  That's why I was trained on a single shot .22 because you load it each time and I mean literally I could shoot a bullseye at 200 yards with that when I was a little kid.
[02:33:28.977 --> 02:33:41.742]  Well you know the Supreme Court back in 39 said that the weapons that were really protected by the Second Amendment were the type in common use at the time by the military and it just so happens that during the time of the revolution that the civilians, the militiamen
[02:33:42.302 --> 02:33:50.970]  How dare you speak badly of the gracious imperial forces of King George III as he put down that disgusting, that disgusting rebellion by these uppity slaves!
[02:34:00.779 --> 02:34:04.282]  Pardon me, I'm just trying to do a little historical context here, Alex, that's all.
[02:34:05.123 --> 02:34:07.845]  The militiamen had better rifles than the regular army.
[02:34:07.865 --> 02:34:12.769]  They were disgusting, wild, savage, heathens!
[02:34:13.790 --> 02:34:18.354]  And we went forward to confiscate their firearms, and they dare fire back at us!
[02:34:18.894 --> 02:34:23.818]  Yes, as what's it in the movie said, in the Patriot, these rustics are so inept.
[02:34:24.639 --> 02:34:24.919]  Yes.
[02:34:24.939 --> 02:34:27.982]  Yeah, and the rustics won.
[02:34:29.053 --> 02:34:32.756]  Yes, the rustics won definitely because they learned how to place those shots.
[02:34:33.136 --> 02:34:34.677]  Now we put fluoride in their water!
[02:34:34.957 --> 02:34:35.898]  That teaches them!
[02:34:36.178 --> 02:34:38.179]  I'm sorry, Mr. Rivero!
[02:34:38.500 --> 02:34:39.260]  Go ahead!
[02:34:40.861 --> 02:34:44.544]  Well, listen, you don't have to worry about fluoride in the water if you're drinking beer all the time.
[02:34:45.695 --> 02:34:46.255]  Absolutely.
[02:34:46.915 --> 02:34:48.296]  Listen, Bob Dacey, great having you here.
[02:34:48.476 --> 02:34:49.476]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:34:49.556 --> 02:34:50.657]  Mike, good seeing you, man.
[02:34:50.697 --> 02:34:52.557]  I'm glad to talk to you for the first time.
[02:34:52.577 --> 02:34:53.538]  Good to talk to you, too.
[02:34:53.798 --> 02:34:58.759]  I will continue to go to WhatReallyHappened.com every day, right after I go to Infowars.com.
[02:34:58.859 --> 02:34:59.600]  Alright, Bob.
[02:34:59.620 --> 02:35:00.400]  Good to see you, my friend.
[02:35:00.420 --> 02:35:00.780]  Thank you.
[02:35:01.020 --> 02:35:01.740]  Thank you very much.
[02:35:02.601 --> 02:35:12.624]  Guys, get ready with the YouTube video of the supposed camera and microphone in the Magnavox digital TV converter, because we're going to go over that here in a moment.
[02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:17.472]  All right, I've been ranting and raving here for the cameras.
[02:35:19.013 --> 02:35:25.598]  Final comments, Mike Rivero, they're really beating the drums now about Iran having secret weapons and devil drones.
[02:35:25.878 --> 02:35:27.600]  Looks like they're really trying to build that back up.
[02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:32.443]  Israel admitted a few days ago they're launching terror attacks inside Iran to try to get them to do something.
[02:35:32.463 --> 02:35:33.244]  Where do you see that going?
[02:35:34.272 --> 02:35:36.113]  Well, obviously, you know, the U.S.
[02:35:36.173 --> 02:35:55.960]  government knows they're in serious, serious trouble, and I think they're trying to go back to the conventional wisdom that if they can get a good regional or global war going, that we, the American people, will forget all about the lies and the cheating and the economic hardships, and we'll just line up behind the flag and salute smartly and throw our children into the flames of a foreign war yet again.
[02:35:56.420 --> 02:36:02.546]  I don't think it's going to work because, again, the dynamics by which information flows through our society has completely changed.
[02:36:02.826 --> 02:36:07.971]  But I think the people running our government are a bunch of old Cold War fossils who don't get it.
[02:36:08.172 --> 02:36:16.460]  They don't understand how the information environment has completely changed because of the Internet, because of your website, because of our radio shows.
[02:36:17.938 --> 02:36:22.379]  Well, that sounds very American Al Qaeda-ish, talking about the Founding Fathers and things.
[02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:25.540]  Mike Rivera, we'll talk to you again soon with your month-to-month visit.
[02:36:25.580 --> 02:36:27.001]  I know that's coming up in just a week or so.
[02:36:27.601 --> 02:36:28.842]  And Godspeed, my friend.
[02:36:28.862 --> 02:36:29.242]  Take care.
[02:36:30.062 --> 02:36:30.802]  Thank you very much.
[02:36:31.262 --> 02:36:31.522]  You bet.
[02:36:31.542 --> 02:36:32.643]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:33.223 --> 02:36:34.443]  Bye-bye to Hawaii.
[02:36:34.523 --> 02:36:36.184]  In fact, let's just say bye to him one more time.
[02:36:37.566 --> 02:36:42.011]  And that's what's so strong about the alternative media is that it's just a webcam.
[02:36:42.051 --> 02:36:42.752]  It's a little studio.
[02:36:42.812 --> 02:36:43.372]  It's some cameras.
[02:36:43.432 --> 02:36:43.913]  It's some lights.
[02:36:43.933 --> 02:36:44.734]  We're here covering the news.
[02:36:44.754 --> 02:36:45.595]  We're having fun with it.
[02:36:46.015 --> 02:36:50.460]  We're just showing the insanity that's being put in the news like it's no big deal.
[02:36:50.720 --> 02:36:58.829]  Like Bush announced that for five years previous they were staging terror attacks in Iran using Al-Qaeda, using Wahhabis out of Saudi Arabia.
[02:37:00.273 --> 02:37:04.475]  And then now Israel admits they're staging terror attacks in Iran, and they just report it like it's a good thing.
[02:37:04.735 --> 02:37:09.758]  Oh, we're assassinating and bombing and killing people in Iran, and they're laying down and taking it.
[02:37:09.818 --> 02:37:10.478]  Aren't they bad?
[02:37:11.279 --> 02:37:14.460]  So I just take the mainstream London Telegraph and go, this is insane!
[02:37:14.841 --> 02:37:17.402]  I take Haratz and go, they're reporting this like it's a good thing.
[02:37:17.742 --> 02:37:18.623]  Is that a good thing?
[02:37:19.723 --> 02:37:22.565]  What would you do if Iran had troops here staging terror attacks?
[02:37:24.466 --> 02:37:25.526]  I mean, think about this.
[02:37:25.626 --> 02:37:27.507]  Okay, I want to go ahead and play this video.
[02:37:27.527 --> 02:37:28.368]  Do you have the YouTube ready?
[02:37:29.318 --> 02:37:32.739]  I want to play this off YouTube because I got a lot of emails.
[02:37:33.019 --> 02:37:36.200]  We wrote a blurb about it saying, is it a hoax?
[02:37:36.340 --> 02:37:37.700]  It appears to be a hoax.
[02:37:38.180 --> 02:37:50.383]  Now remember, this discredits all the serious research where Google and others admit they're using the microphone and the camera to dial in, listen to what you're doing, and then tailor advertising for you, or TiVo and other cable systems being two-way.
[02:37:50.403 --> 02:37:51.923]  In fact, bring me one of the cable boxes.
[02:37:51.943 --> 02:37:52.904]  I want to show folks that in a minute.
[02:37:53.304 --> 02:37:54.564]  Right now, let's go ahead and play part of this clip.
[02:37:54.584 --> 02:37:54.884]  Here it is.
[02:37:54.904 --> 02:37:58.005]  So I bought one of these.
[02:37:58.934 --> 02:38:01.036]  Digital Converter TV Boxes.
[02:38:01.836 --> 02:38:02.977]  I actually bought two of them.
[02:38:04.418 --> 02:38:08.922]  And I had a friend that was trying to tell me that they put cameras in these things.
[02:38:09.222 --> 02:38:19.490]  That you set it on your TV and somebody, the government or whoever, has the ability to spy on you.
[02:38:20.410 --> 02:38:23.112]  And so what I did is I opened it up to prove them wrong.
[02:38:24.834 --> 02:38:26.515]  And lo and behold,
[02:38:29.148 --> 02:38:33.270]  This is a Magnavox unit, by the way, that was purchased at Walmart.
[02:38:33.770 --> 02:38:42.453]  Lo and behold, though, as you can see, right here is a camera unit.
[02:38:43.674 --> 02:38:47.855]  There's actually a, if I can focus here, a microphone.
[02:38:49.836 --> 02:38:51.217]  Here's the RF sensor.
[02:38:52.097 --> 02:38:56.899]  So, not to confuse the camera for, you know, what you would use as a remote control,
[02:38:58.433 --> 02:38:59.633]  But clearly you can see.
[02:39:00.053 --> 02:39:00.813]  Alright, that's enough.
[02:39:00.833 --> 02:39:03.854]  This thing doesn't... We don't have a lot of time left here.
[02:39:04.354 --> 02:39:07.135]  So, we went out and bought the very same box, very same unit.
[02:39:07.895 --> 02:39:10.535]  It's the only unit Slave Mart was selling, Walmart was selling.
[02:39:11.095 --> 02:39:22.657]  It is the very same Magnavox, and you've got the little hole in there behind the black so that the infrared channel controller will work.
[02:39:22.797 --> 02:39:26.858]  This is a converter for the digital to analog.
[02:39:28.123 --> 02:39:39.594]  They said a conversion this week, and we have engineers that work here, I mean, degreed engineers, and one of them looked at this, and this is the same circuitry as you have in the video.
[02:39:39.614 --> 02:39:43.317]  So there would be extra circuitry here for a microphone, for a camera.
[02:39:45.239 --> 02:39:46.960]  And also, this is not two-way.
[02:39:47.621 --> 02:39:51.525]  This system, you know, isn't hooked up to cable, so they wouldn't have a way of getting it out.
[02:39:52.589 --> 02:39:54.530]  And so it appears it is a complete hoax.
[02:39:54.550 --> 02:39:57.752]  You know, you could say, oh well maybe just his unit had it and yours didn't.
[02:39:57.792 --> 02:39:59.794]  Well, we bought this and it didn't.
[02:40:00.294 --> 02:40:06.498]  But then when you notice that there's not the circuitry you would need for it, you know that you've got an issue here.
[02:40:07.859 --> 02:40:15.584]  Because we can look at this circuitry and look at the circuitry in his video and see it's the exact same circuitry and there's not the extra circuitry to have a camera.
[02:40:16.845 --> 02:40:18.286]  And I don't know why this guy did that.
[02:40:19.465 --> 02:40:27.774]  I don't know why, but over and over again I see, you know, we're not just here exposing the mainstream media, we're covering the alternative media.
[02:40:27.794 --> 02:40:32.379]  We're not policing it, we're just getting hundreds of calls and emails, we go and check it for ourselves.
[02:40:32.499 --> 02:40:34.741]  And so I'd say 98% chance this is a hoax.
[02:40:35.242 --> 02:40:36.643]  Now, what does that end up doing?
[02:40:37.744 --> 02:40:40.948]  Well, it ends up discrediting things like this.
[02:40:43.325 --> 02:40:44.106]  That's what it does.
[02:40:44.266 --> 02:40:48.511]  It discredits serious research in a big way.
[02:40:48.551 --> 02:40:50.653]  Because, zoom in over here for me.
[02:40:51.054 --> 02:40:56.259]  If you look at this, this little cheap $350 Acer laptop.
[02:40:56.660 --> 02:40:57.681]  Zoom in for me right here guys.
[02:40:58.502 --> 02:41:01.045]  You can see that there is a camera right there.
[02:41:03.376 --> 02:41:03.736]  Right here.
[02:41:04.797 --> 02:41:09.520]  And there is also a microphone, and Google admits, in fact, we had time, we pulled this up, I should have thought of that.
[02:41:10.741 --> 02:41:15.445]  Google, Google using microphones and cameras to record users.
[02:41:16.205 --> 02:41:21.709]  And you'll find a PrisonPlanet.com article, then it links to a Google press release, and they're scientific research.
[02:41:21.949 --> 02:41:25.271]  And then they bragged that Yahoo's doing it too, but their system's better.
[02:41:25.572 --> 02:41:28.214]  Remember the Super Bowl, the Janet Jackson malfunction with TiVo?
[02:41:29.232 --> 02:41:29.672]  Remember that?
[02:41:30.353 --> 02:41:34.135]  And then TiVo said, the Chicago Tribune, we had 2.2 million rewinds and replays.
[02:41:34.795 --> 02:41:35.836]  It was 2 point something.
[02:41:35.856 --> 02:41:36.777]  It was 2 in a million.
[02:41:37.137 --> 02:41:37.957]  It was 2 million something.
[02:41:37.977 --> 02:41:39.278]  I think it was 2.2 million.
[02:41:39.298 --> 02:41:40.279]  And they said, well, how do you know that?
[02:41:40.299 --> 02:41:42.500]  Well, the cable system is two ways.
[02:41:42.881 --> 02:41:45.962]  And the TiVo system, many of them have microphones and cameras in them.
[02:41:45.982 --> 02:41:46.443]  It's come out.
[02:41:47.043 --> 02:41:47.983]  But that's not what's important.
[02:41:48.003 --> 02:41:49.204]  They're recording what you watch.
[02:41:49.244 --> 02:41:50.264]  They know what you're doing.
[02:41:50.284 --> 02:41:54.365]  They understand your true psychological makeup and your true algorithm.
[02:41:54.505 --> 02:41:56.465]  They think with a 600 question test they can do that.
[02:41:56.745 --> 02:41:59.486]  Imagine with the hundreds of thousands of choices you make every year.
[02:41:59.526 --> 02:42:03.867]  And as the TVs and cable systems become your internet and your Xbox and all this, it's much worse.
[02:42:03.907 --> 02:42:07.028]  So you have this hidden in plain view right in front of everyone.
[02:42:08.548 --> 02:42:13.169]  And then meanwhile, people are out saying the digital converters are doing it when they're not.
[02:42:13.229 --> 02:42:14.310]  And so people go check this.
[02:42:14.330 --> 02:42:15.390]  They find out it's not true.
[02:42:16.394 --> 02:42:23.917]  And then they tell me, oh, it's been disproven that there's a camera on this or that Google or Yahoo or others brag that they have AI computers.
[02:42:23.957 --> 02:42:30.179]  And Google says, don't worry, we're just having a computer create a text of the words and audio in your home.
[02:42:30.199 --> 02:42:34.040]  And if your dog barks, we put up a dog food ad pops up, because your dog's barking.
[02:42:34.321 --> 02:42:37.162]  And the Google computer back at a network goes, oh, there's a dog.
[02:42:37.402 --> 02:42:38.102]  Put a dog food ad.
[02:42:38.422 --> 02:42:40.283]  And they say they listen to what you listen to on TV.
[02:42:40.804 --> 02:42:44.467]  And then an ad for the TV show you're listening to, because they have databases of it, pops up.
[02:42:44.987 --> 02:42:46.488]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:46.889 --> 02:42:49.011]  The real Big Brother surveillance system.
[02:42:49.031 --> 02:42:50.512]  Cameras going up in school bathrooms.
[02:42:50.832 --> 02:42:52.734]  Face scanning cameras going up on the highways and roads.
[02:42:52.974 --> 02:42:53.734]  That's all real.
[02:42:54.615 --> 02:42:58.999]  This, a crock of bull, that only discredits the important work we're doing.
[02:42:59.519 --> 02:43:02.421]  So just because you can't trust the mainstream media, doesn't mean you can trust alternative media.
[02:43:02.782 --> 02:43:04.563]  Check everything for yourself.
[02:43:04.943 --> 02:43:06.805]  That is what we do here.
[02:43:08.021 --> 02:43:10.303]  Right now the world is a scary place.
[02:43:10.523 --> 02:43:15.729]  It's only a matter of time until we are struck again, but this time with biological and chemical attacks.
[02:43:15.969 --> 02:43:20.353]  The thought is scary, but it's important to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
[02:43:20.553 --> 02:43:23.236]  The First Line Defense Kit allows you to do just that.
[02:43:23.416 --> 02:43:33.207]  The first line of defense kit includes Nutri-Immune and Nutri-Defense, providing top biological host defenses against pathogen entry, and provides immune NK killer cell boosting.
[02:43:33.427 --> 02:43:38.373]  Also included, the Nano-Mask Nano-Particular antiviral masks with replacement filters.
[02:43:38.733 --> 02:43:39.053]  I think.
[02:44:08.012 --> 02:44:10.533]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:44:10.873 --> 02:44:12.133]  Loose Change, Final Cut.
[02:44:12.434 --> 02:44:14.414]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:44:14.574 --> 02:44:16.335]  The True Story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:44:16.475 --> 02:44:17.715]  The Late Great USA.
[02:44:17.955 --> 02:44:19.376]  America, Freedom to Fascism.

[02:45:12.740 --> 02:45:21.703]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes are full of chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[02:45:21.963 --> 02:45:25.344]  Did you know that most multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[02:45:25.384 --> 02:45:25.744]  I think so.

[02:46:11.903 --> 02:46:13.164]  Okay, final segment.
[02:46:13.264 --> 02:46:16.445]  I want to cut the audio and go into some analysis of this.
[02:46:16.465 --> 02:46:18.826]  Let's go ahead and kill that for me because I don't have a lot of time.
[02:46:19.366 --> 02:46:21.427]  We got about five minutes left here.
[02:46:22.027 --> 02:46:28.170]  Now, again, being serious, this is what's really surveilling you by tracking what you watch and what you do.
[02:46:28.230 --> 02:46:30.170]  This is a Scientific Atlantic cable box.
[02:46:31.511 --> 02:46:33.812]  And if you look inside, let's see if there's a camera in here.
[02:46:35.501 --> 02:46:37.143]  Oh, right there, hidden camera.
[02:46:37.663 --> 02:46:38.784]  Haha, it's a joke, folks.
[02:46:38.804 --> 02:46:39.385]  I'm just joking.
[02:46:39.765 --> 02:46:41.967]  And that's basically what that other guy, it looks like, did.
[02:46:42.408 --> 02:46:46.252]  Was, uh, you know, basically engaging a hoax.
[02:46:46.292 --> 02:46:50.516]  But maybe, if the guy wants to contact me, we'll have that, what looks like a hoaxer on the show.
[02:46:52.438 --> 02:46:58.420]  We've got four minutes left, ladies and gentlemen, and I wanted to bring up Ted Anderson of Midas Resources, Inc.
[02:46:58.520 --> 02:47:02.662]  because gold went up over $100 in the last week and a half.
[02:47:03.242 --> 02:47:08.064]  It is right up there at the $973 level, what it was basically yesterday.
[02:47:08.364 --> 02:47:10.485]  It went as high as $983, but it's $973.
[02:47:10.805 --> 02:47:14.186]  This is the very last offer with this when Ted bought gold at $865.
[02:47:14.566 --> 02:47:18.348]  He has priced gold and silver, silver at the $9 level,
[02:47:19.901 --> 02:47:20.262]  Go to
[02:47:36.360 --> 02:47:38.641]  No, I mean obviously that would be the wrong thing to do.
[02:48:01.434 --> 02:48:02.635]  I mean, just look at Obama.
[02:48:02.695 --> 02:48:06.478]  He's got all sorts of new ideas on how to get the economy stimulated.
[02:48:06.498 --> 02:48:08.079]  New ideas from Lenin and Marx.
[02:48:08.339 --> 02:48:12.422]  Yeah, it's all about printing money and devaluating currency.
[02:48:12.462 --> 02:48:16.424]  I mean, the foreigners are just going to get fed up and they'll be getting out of the U.S.
[02:48:16.485 --> 02:48:17.005]  Treasuries.
[02:48:17.465 --> 02:48:22.609]  And when that happens, the United States dollar is just going to fall like a rock in the lake.
[02:48:23.449 --> 02:48:27.752]  But meanwhile, I'm looking for every opportunity I can to buy gold.
[02:48:28.133 --> 02:48:29.954]  And I can tell you, you should be too.
[02:48:30.998 --> 02:48:31.839]  You're right about that.
[02:48:31.879 --> 02:48:37.081]  The francs at that $2.21 level, that supply is just about gone.
[02:48:37.101 --> 02:48:39.402]  It ran out of the British sovereigns two days ago.
[02:48:40.163 --> 02:48:44.285]  They're currently right now trading at $242 for the francs.
[02:48:45.025 --> 02:48:49.928]  The supply that I have is at $2.21, so there you can prepare yourself for that price increase.
[02:48:50.388 --> 02:48:53.550]  The Walking Liberty halves, very short in supply.
[02:48:54.210 --> 02:49:00.233]  I do have a new deal that I'll be offering later, but it's not as sweet as this one.
[02:49:00.754 --> 02:49:03.495]  And then the Mercury dimes at $1.59 a coin, too.
[02:49:04.335 --> 02:49:07.777]  Really good buy in the markets.
[02:49:07.797 --> 02:49:07.857]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:49:08.097 --> 02:49:11.278]  This is the end of gold at $100 under what it's selling for.
[02:49:11.518 --> 02:49:13.059]  You cannot beat this deal.
[02:49:13.079 --> 02:49:13.579]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:49:15.040 --> 02:49:19.241]  Ted Anderson is the best gold and silver broker out there, bar none.
[02:49:19.261 --> 02:49:21.502]  We appreciate his support, but you can't find deals this good.
[02:49:21.542 --> 02:49:26.604]  That's why, 30 years in the business, he's so successful with the international context, and those are even running low.
[02:49:26.964 --> 02:49:28.545]  Is this the end of the silver, too, today, Ted?
[02:49:29.345 --> 02:49:31.386]  I mean, I'm watching that particular thing.
[02:49:31.446 --> 02:49:33.786]  I may be able to carry that through for tomorrow.
[02:49:33.866 --> 02:49:35.486]  I'm going to just take a look and see all the supply.
[02:49:35.506 --> 02:49:39.287]  But this is it for the European francs, the Swiss and French.
[02:49:39.307 --> 02:49:41.668]  Yeah, the francs are getting so tight in supply now.
[02:49:41.908 --> 02:49:43.408]  It's just like the British sovereigns.
[02:49:43.448 --> 02:49:44.728]  I just had an opportunity.
[02:49:45.349 --> 02:49:49.770]  I locked in on a ton of these things back when gold was at $870.
[02:49:50.390 --> 02:49:51.930]  And now we're looking at gold at $970.
[02:49:52.430 --> 02:49:55.951]  So yeah, that gives you an idea where the prices are going to go.
[02:49:56.657 --> 02:49:57.018]  800-686-2237.
[02:49:58.739 --> 02:50:00.561]  The deal is good.
[02:50:00.862 --> 02:50:02.904]  They're midnight Central Standard Time tonight.
[02:50:02.924 --> 02:50:04.646]  If you get your call in after, they'll call you back in the morning.
[02:50:04.966 --> 02:50:05.587]  You should get it.
[02:50:05.607 --> 02:50:05.927]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:05.947 --> 02:50:06.968]  1-800-686-2237 or MidasResources.com.
[02:50:07.088 --> 02:50:10.111]  Thanks for spending three minutes with us, Ted.
[02:50:10.131 --> 02:50:10.972]  You bet.
[02:50:11.012 --> 02:50:12.494]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:50:17.779 --> 02:50:20.041]  And in closing, the Obama Deception is on sale now.
[02:50:20.401 --> 02:50:23.483]  Hope you get the Obama Deception at the obamadeception.net.
[02:50:23.523 --> 02:50:23.964]  The new film.
[02:50:23.984 --> 02:50:24.965]  Go watch the free trailer there.
[02:50:24.985 --> 02:50:26.205]  And when you get the film, make all the copies.
[02:50:26.486 --> 02:50:28.507]  Your heart wants, because I want you to.
[02:50:28.567 --> 02:50:31.389]  I want it to go mega-viral physically on the street and on the web.
[02:50:31.670 --> 02:50:33.551]  And it'll be first at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:50:33.931 --> 02:50:35.272]  Super high quality for members there.
[02:50:35.973 --> 02:50:36.853]  That's it for today.
[02:50:36.873 --> 02:50:44.359]  Retransmission starts now in 70 seconds at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with Alan Watt and a lot more.
[02:50:44.619 --> 02:50:45.340]  God bless you all.

[02:50:57.873 --> 02:50:58.454]  Hello, friends.
[02:50:58.494 --> 02:50:59.454]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:50:59.574 --> 02:51:04.156]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:51:04.297 --> 02:51:07.058]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:51:07.278 --> 02:51:10.139]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:51:10.320 --> 02:51:15.042]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:51:15.262 --> 02:51:16.183]  If you simply prepare.
[02:51:16.384 --> 02:51:19.328]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:51:19.628 --> 02:51:26.538]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
