[00:00:02.995 --> 00:00:04.917]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:05.397 --> 00:00:08.279]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:14.744 --> 00:00:15.385]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:17.126]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.827 --> 00:00:18.967]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.568 --> 00:00:20.409]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:22.110]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.373]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:30.957]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:48.862]  We are live, simulcasting now for the final two hours at PrisonPlanet.tv as we track the swine-slash-bird-slash-human flu that they're now reporting has killed 140 people.
[00:00:51.362 --> 00:00:57.144]  But when you look at what regular flus do, they kill far more than that in a week in Mexico during flu season.
[00:00:57.164 --> 00:00:58.124]  Kills tens of thousands.
[00:00:59.488 --> 00:01:02.170]  So why is the media and the government hyping this so much?
[00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.632]  And we'll be recapping all that in closing.
[00:01:04.652 --> 00:01:05.372]  I'm going to go to calls.
[00:01:05.752 --> 00:01:07.774]  Anything else important to add, Paul Watson?
[00:01:09.175 --> 00:01:16.880]  Yeah, there's been a couple of times where we've caught the media putting out fake stories which hype this beyond what it really is.
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.845]  For example, there was a report that when Obama went to Mexico last week,
[00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.373]  Early last week that he shook hands with a archaeologist called Philippe Solis Holguin.
[00:01:31.254 --> 00:01:38.299]  And, uh, the report was that this, uh, archaeologist then died the very day after from swine flu.
[00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:40.701]  And that's why there were all these fears about Obama.
[00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:47.486]  But it turns out that's fake and that he died a week later on, uh, 23rd of April from a heart attack.
[00:01:47.646 --> 00:01:51.669]  But the big report initially was that, you know, he died from swine flu.
[00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.350]  It turned out to be completely fake.
[00:01:54.008 --> 00:01:56.289]  So there's a couple of things like that floating around.
[00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.992]  And yeah, I would agree with you at the moment.
[00:02:00.032 --> 00:02:08.056]  It looks like it's being hyped up because you've got the WHO and the UN saying, you know, it's possible there'll be a pandemic.
[00:02:08.276 --> 00:02:14.360]  And then you look at the actual numbers of how many people are getting infected and how many are making full recovery.
[00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:25.881]  You know, a third of those that were infected in Mexico have completely recovered already, according to... But, if you look at the 1918 flu, that's how it started at first.
[00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:35.111]  So, either they've released it and they know what it's going to mutate into, because they've already done this in the lab, or they're not involved in a...
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.380]  I
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.663]  Or it could be just Mexico hyping it for their own political purposes.
[00:02:55.103 --> 00:03:02.808]  Let's just have an article, Paul, if you can, with bullet points of what it could be and what the scenario is that we're looking at right now.
[00:03:02.868 --> 00:03:06.731]  But thank you so much, Paul Watson, at PrisonPlanet.com for your great reportage.
[00:03:07.532 --> 00:03:08.092]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:03:09.493 --> 00:03:09.854]  You bet.
[00:03:09.974 --> 00:03:13.736]  Okay, let's start going to your calls in this segment and right through quickly.
[00:03:13.796 --> 00:03:15.758]  Tom in Texas from the Genesis Phones.
[00:03:15.798 --> 00:03:16.198]  Go ahead.
[00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:17.159]  Hey, Alex.
[00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.759]  How are you doing today?
[00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:21.147]  This is like Twilight Zone, man, I'm telling you.
[00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:22.448]  A couple things.
[00:03:22.928 --> 00:03:25.889]  Watching the media, they're reporting 40 cases in the U.S.
[00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:26.149]  now.
[00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.369]  20 more cases in New York have been reported.
[00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:29.890]  That's Fox News.
[00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.810]  I just watch it to keep... No, that's CDC.
[00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.191]  It says 40 in the U.S.
[00:03:34.731 --> 00:03:37.992]  Okay, and then the earthquake, 6.0 earthquake outside of Mexico City.
[00:03:38.012 --> 00:03:39.272]  Yeah, I forgot to get to that.
[00:03:39.332 --> 00:03:40.192]  That is confirmed.
[00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:42.093]  Strong earthquake felt in Mexico City.
[00:03:42.593 --> 00:03:45.773]  Okay, the main reason I'm calling today is being a concerned parent.
[00:03:45.793 --> 00:03:47.274]  I've got three kids in public school.
[00:03:47.314 --> 00:03:48.074]  I called the school to
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.960]  But I bet they know about American Idol!
[00:04:18.783 --> 00:04:22.647]  They're close to you in Bexar and Gonzales counties?
[00:04:22.967 --> 00:04:28.352]  She says that they're asking people to voluntarily stay in their home, not to go to public gatherings.
[00:04:28.372 --> 00:04:34.658]  It's more like a voluntary quarantine going on in those counties.
[00:04:35.086 --> 00:04:37.587]  Yeah, and what this is, is great martial law training.
[00:04:37.607 --> 00:04:40.627]  Because under regular martial law, they tell you to stay in your homes.
[00:04:41.548 --> 00:04:48.529]  In fact, guys, YouTube Jello Biafra, martial law song, let's play that coming back.
[00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:55.811]  It's like, stay in your homes, remain calm, the number one threat is freedom.
[00:04:57.264 --> 00:04:59.226]  Alright, thank you so much sir, appreciate your call.
[00:04:59.586 --> 00:05:05.411]  More calls straight ahead from Nathan, Leo, Bill, Dominique, and many, many others on the other phone system.
[00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:10.936]  When we return after this quick break, a lot of the different angles and pieces of intel that callers have.
[00:05:10.957 --> 00:05:12.658]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:05:12.778 --> 00:05:17.863]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:05:18.123 --> 00:05:19.424]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:05:19.724 --> 00:05:27.890]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.894]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:05:33.914 --> 00:05:35.776]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:05:35.856 --> 00:05:38.017]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:05:38.177 --> 00:05:42.440]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:05:42.581 --> 00:05:44.582]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[00:05:44.782 --> 00:05:52.566]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:06:10.894 --> 00:06:13.455]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:06:14.068 --> 00:06:16.116]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:16.915 --> 00:06:22.280]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.005]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:31.127]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:31.267 --> 00:06:33.669]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:44.618]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.161]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:48.582 --> 00:06:49.983]  It's about a one world government.
[00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:56.789]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:05.137]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:05.617 --> 00:07:06.778]  The Obama Deception.
[00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:08.380]  The people strike back.
[00:07:09.972 --> 00:07:13.934]  If you have over $10,000 in credit card debt, you need to hear this.
[00:07:14.214 --> 00:07:18.857]  Have you been watching the banks getting their bailout money and wondering where your relief is?
[00:07:19.137 --> 00:07:21.539]  The answer you're looking for is the bailout group.
[00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:26.942]  The bailout group has settled over $100 million in credit card debt for people just like you.
[00:07:27.242 --> 00:07:36.047]  The bailout group can help cut your debt by up to 60% of its original value, removing those high interest fees and rolling everything into one low monthly payment.
[00:07:36.267 --> 00:07:37.027]  And the best part?
[00:07:37.327 --> 00:07:41.829]  All GCN listeners qualify for a free 5-minute debt relief consultation.
[00:07:41.989 --> 00:07:45.610]  This is the system that credit card companies don't want you to know about.
[00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.131]  This is a fast, proven, and legal process for your credit card debt concerns.
[00:07:50.391 --> 00:07:52.051]  Call the bailout group now at 800-324-6554.
[00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:52.271]  That's 800-324-6554.
[00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:53.852]  Debt relief experts are standing by.
[00:07:53.892 --> 00:07:55.692]  You have nothing to lose, except your credit card debt.
[00:07:55.712 --> 00:07:55.932]  Call 800-324-6554.
[00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:08.117]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:08.177 --> 00:08:10.619]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:29.254 --> 00:08:36.808]  If you go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, you're going to see great articles, very informative about Steve Watson, Paul Watson, Curt Nemo, Aaron Dykes, and others.
[00:08:37.841 --> 00:08:50.364]  Let me give you the background of all of this, how they've staged flu outbreaks, how they've killed people with the vaccines, and then were forced to stop it in 76, how this stuff always pops up on military bases.
[00:08:51.124 --> 00:08:54.365]  This has definitely got the hand of the new world order in it, and it's very serious.
[00:08:55.325 --> 00:08:57.786]  And again, it can mutate into something very, very deadly.
[00:08:58.522 --> 00:09:02.065]  You've got the United Nations out running around saying this could be a global pandemic.
[00:09:02.865 --> 00:09:06.328]  You've got all their previous reports about how bird flu could kill billions of people.
[00:09:07.208 --> 00:09:08.509]  We're not saying that here.
[00:09:08.549 --> 00:09:14.393]  We're just reporting on what these guys are doing, and we're doing the best job we can to break it down.
[00:09:14.413 --> 00:09:15.574]  Let's blitz through phone calls.
[00:09:16.275 --> 00:09:18.236]  Let's pull up the in-studio calls.
[00:09:18.256 --> 00:09:20.157]  Let's go to some of those guys and back to the Genesis calls.
[00:09:21.278 --> 00:09:23.680]  Let's go ahead and go to Matt in Texas.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.460]  Matt, you're on the air.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:24.801]  Welcome.
[00:09:25.341 --> 00:09:26.482]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[00:09:26.502 --> 00:09:27.843]  It's a pleasure to talk to you.
[00:09:28.596 --> 00:09:42.508]  I just want to comment really on, when I was watching, uh, waiting to watch the, uh, press release for the CDC and Homeland Security release, um, uh, we were watching Fox News and pretty much like they just had a banner that said, don't worry, Baxter's making a vaccine.
[00:09:43.028 --> 00:09:46.491]  And they just kept it on the screen for like two minutes while they showed other video.
[00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:52.857]  And I'm just thinking, wow, you know, no mention of the avian flu scandal, you know, no, it's complete psych warfare.
[00:09:53.697 --> 00:10:13.532]  And then during the middle of the press release, or at the end of the press release, I'm sorry, the reporter asked the head of Homeland Security if this was related to bioterrorism, and Fox News cut the audio and went back to the reporter who was just commenting and regurgitating the same stuff that Napolitano was saying.
[00:10:13.552 --> 00:10:18.496]  And then right after that they butchered the 1976 fact saying that there was one death
[00:10:21.881 --> 00:10:23.842]  Uh, no mention of the 40 million vaccines.
[00:10:23.862 --> 00:10:27.764]  You know, it's just complete, like, warfare and it makes me sick, you know?
[00:10:28.665 --> 00:10:32.387]  Well, the history, uh, if you listen to the medical histories, thousands died.
[00:10:33.027 --> 00:10:38.910]  Officially, uh, Encyclopedia Britannica, uh, it says, uh, a couple hundred deaths.
[00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.452]  They are just absolutely lying if they say one death.
[00:10:42.472 --> 00:10:43.432]  I mean, everybody remembers 76.
[00:10:44.989 --> 00:10:49.552]  How they were telling the whole nation you must be vaccinated, and then all these deaths occurred, and they had to recall it.
[00:10:49.792 --> 00:11:03.780]  Just like in 2002, they ordered 14,000 first responders, that's all the medical workers, all the police, all the firemen, all the county, city, state, workers, federal, to take the shot, and the LA Times reported 99.9% said no.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:08.463]  4,000 said yes, and there were a bunch of deaths from those that did take it.
[00:11:09.123 --> 00:11:10.124]  So, it's just incredible.
[00:11:11.237 --> 00:11:12.897]  Can I just end on saying one thing?
[00:11:13.277 --> 00:11:27.540]  I was doing a little bit of research and I came across a copy of the Rebuilding America's Defenses and on page 60 on the bottom paragraph, or the whole paragraph talks about... It says we've got to condition the public and the media to accept the use of rice-specific bioweapons.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:39.382]  Right, and it says although it may take several decades for this process of transformation to unfold, the art of warfare on air, land, and sea will be vastly different and will include long-range missiles and perhaps the world of microbes.
[00:11:41.522 --> 00:11:42.623]  It just sounds a little suspicious.
[00:11:42.643 --> 00:11:45.948]  Well, I mean, have you found the part in there about race-specific bioweapons?
[00:11:46.268 --> 00:11:47.089]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:47.249 --> 00:11:58.202]  There, at the bottom there, it says, uh, in advanced forms of biological warfare that can target specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool.
[00:11:58.223 --> 00:12:00.045]  I mean, that right there says it all.
[00:12:00.365 --> 00:12:04.527]  And then Cheney in other speeches to elite groups called for its use.
[00:12:04.908 --> 00:12:12.172]  In fact, I found the Austin American Statesman, normally a terrible newspaper, rebuked Cheney for that at the time before he was even president.
[00:12:12.472 --> 00:12:22.397]  Hey guys, Vice President, Freudian slip there, Google PNAC, race-specific bioweapons, or PNAC, PNAC,
[00:12:27.947 --> 00:12:29.147]  Race Weapons, Dick Cheney.
[00:12:29.167 --> 00:12:34.029]  I want to show folks on screen at PrisonPlanet.tv the actual Austin American Statesman article.
[00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:36.330]  Because they won't believe a PNAC document if we show them.
[00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:41.511]  But show them a newspaper, it'll... You know, the mainstream media says it.
[00:12:41.811 --> 00:12:42.672]  Thank you so much.
[00:12:42.712 --> 00:12:43.892]  I appreciate your call, Matt.
[00:12:44.252 --> 00:12:44.792]  Great points.
[00:12:45.032 --> 00:12:45.352]  You bet.
[00:12:45.692 --> 00:12:46.193]  D.K.
[00:12:46.253 --> 00:12:46.773]  Wilson.
[00:12:47.493 --> 00:12:48.693]  You are on the air, D.K.
[00:12:48.713 --> 00:12:50.114]  Wilson, calling from Texas.
[00:12:50.134 --> 00:12:50.494]  Go ahead.
[00:12:51.081 --> 00:12:52.442]  Yeah, hello Alex.
[00:12:52.542 --> 00:12:57.865]  Yeah, I actually interviewed you at the Adolphus Hotel at the JFK Conference, at the Lancer Conference.
[00:12:58.465 --> 00:12:59.326]  Oh, cool.
[00:12:59.646 --> 00:12:59.906]  Yeah.
[00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:03.108]  I just got some news and some thoughts on this stuff.
[00:13:03.128 --> 00:13:03.728]  Oh yeah, I remember you.
[00:13:03.748 --> 00:13:06.690]  We talked in the... You interviewed Jim Marsh, too.
[00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:10.892]  We talked in there, you know, in one of the reading areas out there in those big chairs.
[00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:11.793]  Exactly.
[00:13:11.813 --> 00:13:12.313]  Yep, yep.
[00:13:12.353 --> 00:13:12.873]  How you doing?
[00:13:13.213 --> 00:13:13.574]  Good, man.
[00:13:13.614 --> 00:13:14.014]  Good to see you.
[00:13:14.054 --> 00:13:15.835]  You're wearing a head cap.
[00:13:16.377 --> 00:13:17.598]  Yeah, Bad Dan, I sure am.
[00:13:17.638 --> 00:13:19.078]  Yep, I sure was, sure am.
[00:13:19.438 --> 00:13:22.260]  Yeah, a little news for you.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:31.344]  Richard Besser of the CDC just gave a press conference and said that there's no existing vaccine for this flu.
[00:13:32.125 --> 00:13:32.525]  Okay.
[00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:40.669]  Then on MSNBC, they interviewed a doctor who said to take Tamiflu and there's something else called Relaflex.
[00:13:42.653 --> 00:13:45.075]  Some other kind of flu virus.
[00:13:45.395 --> 00:13:47.417]  Everything seems to be conflicting right now.
[00:13:48.097 --> 00:13:52.640]  He said that the strain is much stronger in Mexico than it is here.
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:14:01.006]  Let's see as Paul said and someone else said there are 149 cases now allegedly in Mexico and 40 here.
[00:14:01.366 --> 00:14:11.973]  But while Besser was talking MSNBC showed a map with two cases in Texas and I just heard the worker earlier say that there were 20 in San Antonio.
[00:14:12.213 --> 00:14:15.415]  Yeah, that's in the San Antonio Express News.
[00:14:15.455 --> 00:14:17.495]  Guys, punch up the Google map.
[00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:25.239]  There's a live Google map that they've got that is showing accurately what the latest reported cases are.
[00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:31.742]  Now, I don't know if the government's being accurate itself, but I'm saying this map has the most up-to-date with the latest numbers.
[00:14:31.782 --> 00:14:35.804]  Let's punch that up on PrisonPlanet.tv viewer screens right now.
[00:14:35.824 --> 00:14:39.566]  You can go to PrisonPlanet.tv, folks, if you'd like to be able to
[00:14:40.666 --> 00:14:42.828]  You know, see all of this and to become a member.
[00:14:43.628 --> 00:14:47.792]  Though I have been taking these reports and posting them for free up on Infowars.com.
[00:14:47.852 --> 00:14:50.654]  Not free for us, we've got to pay for the bandwidth, hence the membership.
[00:14:51.354 --> 00:14:52.956]  But there it is, the cases.
[00:14:53.616 --> 00:14:54.857]  And zoom in on Texas.
[00:14:55.397 --> 00:14:58.340]  Let's zoom in on Texas and see how many cases it's showing.
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:02.783]  They're showing one in Fort Worth, one in Dallas, one in Garland.
[00:15:03.704 --> 00:15:04.384]  They're showing
[00:15:05.963 --> 00:15:27.164]  uh... a whole bunch south of san antonio one two three four five six seven eight nine so this is an up-to-date because as of saturday most the cases were north of san antonio right uh... so that you know that i live here there's awesome right there on your screen so that they've got cases as far north as new bronvilles now and then out to the uh...
[00:15:27.705 --> 00:15:28.646]  Yes, let's see.
[00:15:28.706 --> 00:15:31.669]  Worldwide they're passing out masks at airports.
[00:15:45.121 --> 00:15:45.741]  I don't know.
[00:16:02.669 --> 00:16:24.327]  This is all part of training as the government saves you, it gives you the medicine, it tells you what to do, it tells you to stay in your house, and I've predicted before they release real plagues over and over again, they'll have lots of scares and beta tests, and then Napolitano at O&M Security basically says that, says, oh, this is a good practice run for us to get ready, and we think very soon we're going to be hit by the big one.
[00:16:24.748 --> 00:16:25.869]  I mean, that is very chilling.
[00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:31.092]  Okay, now the other medicine doctor was talking about was called Relenza.
[00:16:31.693 --> 00:16:43.239]  Okay, and on that 6.0 earthquake, there was one, remember there was just an earthquake in Acapulco on the 13th of this month as well.
[00:16:43.299 --> 00:16:49.442]  So two weeks later, there's another 6.0 earthquake in Mexico, outside of Mexico City.
[00:16:50.223 --> 00:16:54.265]  And it looks to me like there's a lot of confusion, a lot of
[00:16:54.845 --> 00:16:56.587]  Disparate news being spread around.
[00:16:57.327 --> 00:16:59.889]  Some people reporting that people are dying everywhere.
[00:16:59.969 --> 00:17:01.771]  People reporting that they're not dying everywhere.
[00:17:02.592 --> 00:17:04.073]  People are reporting to wear masks.
[00:17:04.553 --> 00:17:06.835]  This guy comes on television and says, don't wear masks.
[00:17:07.316 --> 00:17:16.123]  Okay, so it seems like in Mexico, everybody, if everybody remembers in 1968, the revolution started in Mexico City with the student.
[00:17:16.603 --> 00:17:19.826]  The earthquakes happened right in Mexico, right outside of Mexico City.
[00:17:20.487 --> 00:17:23.429]  Now we have this flu thing and everybody's basically home-ridden.
[00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:26.572]  And as you said, Alex, the government's failing there.
[00:17:26.972 --> 00:17:35.659]  And if there's a revolution that's going to start or some kind of mass protest, it's going to start with the students and with indigenous people kind of sweeping up behind them.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.521]  That's on one tier.
[00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:43.306]  On another tier, it seems like there's this basic scare, worldwide scare.
[00:17:43.866 --> 00:17:49.168]  And just like you just said, a kind of training, a build-up for something in the near future.
[00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:50.908]  Alright, thank you.
[00:17:50.928 --> 00:17:51.649]  Good to hear from you.
[00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:53.709]  Plug the outfit you write for.
[00:17:53.729 --> 00:17:56.450]  Oh, that's okay, Alex.
[00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.191]  No problem, man.
[00:17:57.331 --> 00:18:00.252]  And you also do audio blogs, so tell folks about that.
[00:18:01.252 --> 00:18:01.872]  Yeah, man.
[00:18:01.972 --> 00:18:02.612]  It's okay.
[00:18:02.752 --> 00:18:04.873]  I write a sports blog called Sports on My Mind.
[00:18:05.153 --> 00:18:07.374]  It's sports and culture and society and stuff like that.
[00:18:07.734 --> 00:18:08.434]  No big deal, though.
[00:18:08.454 --> 00:18:09.175]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[00:18:09.275 --> 00:18:10.715]  I just wanted to report that to you, man.
[00:18:10.815 --> 00:18:11.815]  Alright, thank you so much.
[00:18:11.835 --> 00:18:12.536]  Good to see you again.
[00:18:12.556 --> 00:18:13.276]  Good to hear from you again.
[00:18:14.983 --> 00:18:15.784]  I want to be clear.
[00:18:16.424 --> 00:18:34.256]  A lot of things the public isn't ready to accept, but if the Secretary of Defense said it, and government documents show it, and I have stuff from the 1950s with the Australian and British governments saying they had tsunami weapons that were classified that could cause tsunamis, but in 1997,
[00:18:37.699 --> 00:18:40.900]  In the April issue of the Army Times newspaper.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.680]  It was a daily issue.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.260]  It was in April.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.561]  I want to say April 16th.
[00:18:45.201 --> 00:18:48.082]  Google Secretary of Defense William Cohen earthquake weapons.
[00:18:48.562 --> 00:18:50.042]  Let's put the Army Times on screen.
[00:18:50.082 --> 00:18:51.102]  Let's see how good my memory is.
[00:18:52.102 --> 00:18:53.143]  April 16th.
[00:18:53.543 --> 00:18:54.403]  No, April 23rd.
[00:18:55.943 --> 00:18:56.524]  Oh, that's almost.
[00:18:58.404 --> 00:18:59.204]  It is.
[00:18:59.224 --> 00:18:59.204]  1997.
[00:18:59.244 --> 00:19:02.305]  New Secretary of Defense William Cohen earthquake weapons.
[00:19:04.209 --> 00:19:05.274]  And let's put that up on screen.
[00:19:05.294 --> 00:19:06.378]  Let's see how good my memory is.
[00:19:07.102 --> 00:19:07.443]  April of 97.
[00:19:07.483 --> 00:19:07.724]  I know that.
[00:19:09.448 --> 00:19:10.449]  Let's see if I'm correct.
[00:19:11.229 --> 00:19:16.352]  Defense Link, transcript, DOD, Defense Link, Department of Defense, what is the date on that?
[00:19:16.992 --> 00:19:17.733]  April 28th!
[00:19:17.993 --> 00:19:19.313]  That's tomorrow!
[00:19:19.854 --> 00:19:21.515]  But I thought I gave the speech on the 23rd.
[00:19:21.575 --> 00:19:22.955]  Okay, well my memory fails.
[00:19:22.975 --> 00:19:23.496]  See, that's weird.
[00:19:23.796 --> 00:19:24.656]  I can't completely trust it.
[00:19:26.057 --> 00:19:27.978]  It's like it's almost always right on target.
[00:19:28.018 --> 00:19:36.223]  I remember in April, I remember exactly what he said about seismic earthquake weapons, and you can go read it at the Defense Link, army.mil.
[00:19:37.043 --> 00:19:39.106]  And that was, uh, twelve years ago.
[00:19:39.286 --> 00:19:44.652]  So, there I am giving you something twelve years old with near precision, but I got the date wrong.
[00:19:45.711 --> 00:19:47.992]  This may be a defensively transcript from days later.
[00:19:48.012 --> 00:19:52.154]  I don't know why the 23rd comes to mind, but I'm going to give it another speech in two.
[00:19:52.174 --> 00:19:53.275]  That's the problem with data.
[00:19:53.315 --> 00:19:54.215]  It kind of all mixes together.
[00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:55.155]  That's why I got to be careful.
[00:19:55.616 --> 00:19:57.136]  But there you have it.
[00:19:57.236 --> 00:19:57.817]  Print that for me.
[00:19:57.837 --> 00:20:02.079]  I want to read about the earthquake weapons, weather weapons, which they now admit they have in there.
[00:20:02.119 --> 00:20:05.680]  And so, yeah, big earthquakes in Mexico right as this is happening.
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.401]  A big six point plus.
[00:20:07.941 --> 00:20:09.122]  It gets crazier and crazier.
[00:20:09.946 --> 00:20:10.486]  You worry.
[00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:12.707]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[00:20:12.987 --> 00:20:13.267]  Hi.
[00:20:13.527 --> 00:20:16.028]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[00:20:16.308 --> 00:20:20.569]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[00:20:20.849 --> 00:20:23.029]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[00:20:23.329 --> 00:20:26.390]  To speed it up you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.391]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[00:20:28.611 --> 00:20:29.991]  Her wild food knowledge package
[00:20:30.051 --> 00:20:30.932]  We're good to go.
[00:20:59.071 --> 00:20:59.712]  Start now.
[00:20:59.992 --> 00:21:00.932]  Knowledge is power.
[00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:02.513]  Better take action.
[00:21:02.693 --> 00:21:03.734]  I think a storm's coming.
[00:21:10.498 --> 00:21:15.801]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:16.302 --> 00:21:23.286]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:21:23.886 --> 00:21:30.053]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:30.473 --> 00:21:32.295]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:32.435 --> 00:21:34.857]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:34.938 --> 00:21:45.889]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:47.795]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:48.175 --> 00:21:49.556]  It's about a one world government.
[00:21:50.036 --> 00:21:56.379]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:23:09.625 --> 00:23:12.266]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[00:23:12.847 --> 00:23:15.828]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[00:23:16.188 --> 00:23:19.610]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:26.154]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[00:23:26.554 --> 00:23:31.596]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.

[00:24:01.718 --> 00:24:03.679]  There's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway.
[00:24:03.699 --> 00:24:04.400]  Use it only in emergency.
[00:24:31.645 --> 00:24:33.668]  Can you hear me?
[00:24:49.121 --> 00:24:58.871]  A quick update from Dr. Sherry Tinfini, who runs a practice out of Mexico, consults down there, medical doctor, one of the leading experts out there, even in mainstream media talking about bird flu and analyzing it.
[00:24:59.352 --> 00:25:01.013]  We had her on for 45 minutes during the first hour.
[00:25:01.033 --> 00:25:03.216]  She was going to be popping in again from Mexico.
[00:25:03.256 --> 00:25:04.077]  She's in Monterey.
[00:25:06.087 --> 00:25:09.270]  First they cancelled their big medical conference that was already going on down there.
[00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:12.633]  Then they told them they basically have to be bussed out.
[00:25:14.274 --> 00:25:17.777]  If they don't take a plane today, they'll be bussed out tomorrow.
[00:25:18.298 --> 00:25:21.621]  So not only is the border wide open, they're making people go back.
[00:25:21.641 --> 00:25:22.982]  I mean, this is martial law.
[00:25:24.043 --> 00:25:26.385]  So Mexico is taking this very, very seriously.
[00:25:26.765 --> 00:25:30.128]  Why on earth, Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, would they make you leave now?
[00:25:30.188 --> 00:25:30.829]  Give us the latest.
[00:25:31.294 --> 00:25:39.381]  Well, they just, um, downstairs, they just unfolded all of the, uh, all of the conference materials and everybody that had booths and everything are packing up all their stuff.
[00:25:39.921 --> 00:25:54.192]  And they made an announcement that if anybody who could not get a plane out today, that they were, uh, they had a bus, the five hour bus ride from Monterey, and they were going to take people across the border and take them to San Antonio today.
[00:25:54.212 --> 00:25:59.877]  It's, um, so, um, they, they're really serious about, about people leaving and nobody's like,
[00:26:00.216 --> 00:26:09.179]  You know, holding a gun to our heads and telling us that we have to leave, but there's such a sense of urgency amongst the Mexican officials here about getting us out of the country.
[00:26:09.199 --> 00:26:12.381]  It just makes me a little suspicious.
[00:26:12.401 --> 00:26:12.661]  Why?
[00:26:12.821 --> 00:26:13.001]  Why?
[00:26:13.301 --> 00:26:13.721]  I don't know.
[00:26:13.801 --> 00:26:17.363]  Maybe they really are going to close the borders and not let anybody back in or back out.
[00:26:18.203 --> 00:26:26.946]  So we've decided that maybe the prudent thing to do is to just go ahead and leave with everybody else, because we were going to stay here until Saturday.
[00:26:26.966 --> 00:26:28.247]  I mean, it's a beautiful place.
[00:26:28.267 --> 00:26:28.927]  We're going to enjoy.
[00:26:29.349 --> 00:26:32.932]  Well, Dr. Tenpenny, this has been a big escalation in the last hour and a half since you were on with us.
[00:26:32.952 --> 00:26:34.974]  Other thoughts on why they're so panicked?
[00:26:35.014 --> 00:26:36.055]  You know, I'm really not sure.
[00:26:36.075 --> 00:26:37.496]  I mean, it's called a Monterey Healthcare City.
[00:26:58.826 --> 00:27:02.567]  You know, Monterey is a very large medical tourism center.
[00:27:02.607 --> 00:27:05.948]  It's one of the global places where people come to get health care.
[00:27:05.968 --> 00:27:10.470]  And that was the conference that I was here for, for this Medical Tourism Association conference.
[00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:18.252]  And they have wonderful facilities that are five-star that look every bit like the Cleveland Clinic or places in the U.S.
[00:27:18.872 --> 00:27:20.813]  And they are the ones that are calling the shots.
[00:27:20.893 --> 00:27:23.013]  It's not the Medical Tourism Association.
[00:27:23.073 --> 00:27:24.434]  It's not the conference.
[00:27:24.494 --> 00:27:25.474]  It's not the hotel.
[00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:28.395]  They're the ones who are making a really big deal.
[00:27:28.877 --> 00:27:40.588]  And the gentleman who was up in front of the group this morning telling us that they were canceling the tours and then they were canceling the rest of the conference, he's in close contact apparently with officials from Mexico City.
[00:27:41.289 --> 00:27:46.754]  And he was saying that these were sort of their rules because there were several people in the conference that said, hey, you know, we're here.
[00:27:47.253 --> 00:27:49.153]  Nobody's going to be able to get a flight out today.
[00:27:49.213 --> 00:27:50.954]  Can we at least do part of the conference?
[00:27:51.014 --> 00:27:52.814]  Maybe do some of it tomorrow?
[00:27:53.094 --> 00:27:57.235]  Can we have the conference from noon to midnight and get as much of it in?
[00:27:57.295 --> 00:27:57.576]  Nope.
[00:27:57.656 --> 00:27:58.416]  It's cancelled.
[00:27:58.576 --> 00:27:59.796]  You can't be in this room.
[00:27:59.876 --> 00:28:02.397]  And now they're saying they're setting up buses for us to leave.
[00:28:03.277 --> 00:28:08.418]  And now there's been a big 6-plus magnitude earthquake in Mexico City.
[00:28:08.438 --> 00:28:11.739]  This is getting weirder and weirder.
[00:28:13.087 --> 00:28:16.388]  A strong earthquake felt in Mexico City, AP reports.
[00:28:16.428 --> 00:28:22.730]  A strong earthquake struck central Mexico on Monday, swaying tall buildings in the capital and sending office workers into the streets.
[00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:38.975]  The 6.0 magnitude quake was centered near Chilpaningo, about 130 miles southwest of Mexico City, or 50 miles, 80 kilometers from the resort of Acapulco, according to the U.S.
[00:28:39.015 --> 00:28:39.895]  Geological Survey.
[00:28:41.084 --> 00:28:43.746]  So it's just really, when it rains, it pours down there.
[00:28:44.247 --> 00:28:45.288]  I guess so, Alex.
[00:28:45.608 --> 00:28:47.990]  Well, I'm going to have to cut this short because I have to pack.
[00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.272]  Okay, I know you've got to leave right now.
[00:28:50.632 --> 00:28:52.714]  I'm going to put you on hold, Doctor.
[00:28:52.834 --> 00:28:56.397]  We're going to go over to San Antonio, probably spend the night there tonight.
[00:28:56.657 --> 00:28:59.139]  So, I've got the number for your producer.
[00:28:59.179 --> 00:29:01.321]  Would you like me to give you a call in tomorrow morning?
[00:29:01.741 --> 00:29:06.365]  Yes, 1130 Central, and if you can't, we'll talk to you when you get back to your home.
[00:29:06.785 --> 00:29:07.746]  Thank you so much, Doctor.
[00:29:08.274 --> 00:29:08.794]  You're welcome.
[00:29:08.814 --> 00:29:09.255]  Take care.
[00:29:09.455 --> 00:29:10.376]  Alright, we'll see you tomorrow.
[00:29:10.416 --> 00:29:10.756]  Thank you.
[00:29:11.597 --> 00:29:18.242]  She called us to let us know that she wouldn't be able to do the show tomorrow from Mexico, that she was going to be leaving.
[00:29:18.262 --> 00:29:19.783]  So I wanted you to hear that directly from her.
[00:29:20.123 --> 00:29:21.745]  Another eyewitness in Mexico.
[00:29:22.225 --> 00:29:24.867]  As all of this goes on, she's in one of the northern territories there.
[00:29:27.349 --> 00:29:28.110]  Northern states.
[00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:29.911]  I know we have a lot of phone calls.
[00:29:29.951 --> 00:29:30.712]  Those are coming up.
[00:29:32.216 --> 00:29:37.637]  I want to recap some of the top news and talk to Dr. Deagle, another medical doctor, get his other perspective.
[00:29:37.657 --> 00:29:41.158]  You know, you kind of heard from Tim Penney that this could be really bad, but probably isn't.
[00:29:41.458 --> 00:29:43.239]  We'll see what Dr. D has to say.
[00:29:43.259 --> 00:29:50.521]  And then we've got Steve Quayle coming up on the show, and that should also be informative.
[00:29:50.541 --> 00:29:51.881]  Different angles, different thoughts.
[00:29:52.221 --> 00:29:54.922]  Your calls, my analysis, Paul Watson's take.
[00:29:55.442 --> 00:29:57.302]  All of us together, breaking this down.
[00:29:57.562 --> 00:29:58.903]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.203 --> 00:30:00.423]  InfoWars.com is the site.
[00:30:00.523 --> 00:30:03.513]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.456 --> 00:30:07.145]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.402 --> 00:30:17.367]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[00:30:17.607 --> 00:30:21.910]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:30:22.171 --> 00:30:27.274]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[00:30:27.775 --> 00:30:34.840]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:40.242]  Simply put, 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[00:30:40.683 --> 00:30:46.145]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:30:46.525 --> 00:30:52.008]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.
[00:30:52.328 --> 00:30:58.054]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[00:30:58.274 --> 00:31:00.796]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.

[00:31:02.258 --> 00:31:06.622]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:16.924 --> 00:31:22.268]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:22.808 --> 00:31:29.013]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:29.313 --> 00:31:31.134]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:31.274 --> 00:31:33.656]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:31:33.736 --> 00:31:44.644]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:46.906 --> 00:31:48.167]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:48.588 --> 00:31:49.929]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:50.449 --> 00:31:56.775]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:57.356 --> 00:32:05.123]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:05.623 --> 00:32:06.764]  The Obama Deception.
[00:32:07.205 --> 00:32:08.386]  The people strike back.
[00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:13.632]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:32:13.812 --> 00:32:17.875]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:32:18.055 --> 00:32:29.502]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:32:29.722 --> 00:32:35.546]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:32:35.786 --> 00:32:36.426]  We're good to go.
[00:32:58.268 --> 00:32:58.468]  We're good.
[00:33:13.713 --> 00:33:18.376]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[00:33:18.596 --> 00:33:20.777]  Would you stand up for truth?
[00:33:20.877 --> 00:33:24.099]  Or would you turn away till you land?
[00:33:24.299 --> 00:33:28.521]  And what if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[00:33:28.721 --> 00:33:31.103]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[00:33:31.743 --> 00:33:33.104]  Or would you turn it off?
[00:33:37.829 --> 00:33:38.430]  We're good.
[00:33:54.489 --> 00:33:57.052]  I see a message from the government, like every day.
[00:33:57.332 --> 00:33:59.895]  I watch it and listen and call them all suckers.
[00:34:00.176 --> 00:34:02.258]  They warnin' me about Osama or whatever.
[00:34:02.498 --> 00:34:04.160]  Picture me buyin' this scam.
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.041]  I said, never.
[00:34:05.422 --> 00:34:07.864]  You in tune to a hard truth soldier spittin'.
[00:34:08.085 --> 00:34:10.507]  I stay committed, give up, either die or lose commission.
[00:34:10.707 --> 00:34:13.050]  It's all a part of fightin' devil's state mind control.
[00:34:13.891 --> 00:34:14.591]  We're good to go.
[00:34:45.586 --> 00:34:50.267]  Alright, we got Dr. Degal on for about 10 minutes, and then I'm gonna just bam, bam, bam, go through your calls.
[00:34:51.608 --> 00:34:53.048]  And Steve Quayle is coming up.
[00:34:53.168 --> 00:34:56.029]  I'm gonna have Dr. D back up throughout the week.
[00:34:56.049 --> 00:34:57.329]  He's a Genesis Talk Show host here.
[00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:59.970]  Nutramedical.com's the website.
[00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:01.231]  Another medical doctor.
[00:35:01.251 --> 00:35:02.351]  We'll give you his bio in a moment.
[00:35:02.391 --> 00:35:10.113]  Before we go any further, I want to encourage you to continue to support us, but also get materials that are great for waking other people up in your area.
[00:35:10.593 --> 00:35:13.094]  Namely... Namely...
[00:35:14.798 --> 00:35:17.219]  Infowars.com, the online video and bookstore.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:22.782]  Truth Rising, Terror Storm, Endgame, The Obama Deception.
[00:35:22.862 --> 00:35:24.583]  People are ready to see these films now.
[00:35:24.923 --> 00:35:30.225]  Get the DVDs, make copies, get them out to folks, or see them all in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:30.526 --> 00:35:31.206]  Oh, and do something else.
[00:35:31.226 --> 00:35:34.868]  Go back to Infowars.com, and show them the shopping cart, the AHU shopping cart.
[00:35:35.368 --> 00:35:37.489]  Click on the top banner for the t-shirts.
[00:35:37.929 --> 00:35:40.630]  We got a bunch of other ones that we're getting made right now that are about to be up there.
[00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:41.331]  Look at this.
[00:35:42.278 --> 00:35:45.945]  We've got the Come and Take It shirt, a new design, with an AK-47.
[00:35:46.425 --> 00:35:49.491]  We've got the Socialism shirt, with a gun to the head.
[00:35:49.551 --> 00:35:50.954]  Click on the Live Free or Die one.
[00:35:51.515 --> 00:35:53.979]  That's the design on the front and the back of BigInfoWars.com.
[00:35:54.921 --> 00:35:55.421]  A Minuteman.
[00:35:56.102 --> 00:35:59.004]  Click on the Minuteman himself and it will enlarge it.
[00:35:59.104 --> 00:35:59.504]  There you go.
[00:35:59.905 --> 00:36:01.186]  Live Free or Die!
[00:36:01.846 --> 00:36:03.527]  That is our best-selling shirt right now.
[00:36:04.308 --> 00:36:10.432]  And you can also show folks the Obama shirt, that white one down there.
[00:36:10.493 --> 00:36:12.254]  New World Order with the Obama symbol.
[00:36:12.674 --> 00:36:13.375]  Great way, folks.
[00:36:13.575 --> 00:36:14.676]  It's not an offensive shirt.
[00:36:14.696 --> 00:36:15.656]  People say, what does that mean?
[00:36:16.397 --> 00:36:17.778]  And you can explain it to them.
[00:36:18.976 --> 00:36:21.797]  So again, please go to InfoWars.com and get the t-shirts.
[00:36:21.837 --> 00:36:25.739]  It's a great way to meet like-minded people when you go to these tea parties or in the Fed rallies.
[00:36:26.199 --> 00:36:29.741]  But not just there, to church or school or the coffee shop or the grocery store.
[00:36:30.101 --> 00:36:32.422]  You want to meet like-minded people, this is the way to do it.
[00:36:32.582 --> 00:36:34.603]  All at InfoWars.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:34.623 --> 00:36:34.663]  888-253-3139.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:42.921]  Really in-depth stuff.
[00:36:42.961 --> 00:36:44.202]  It's probably going to be shocking to hear.
[00:36:44.222 --> 00:36:45.603]  I haven't talked to Steve.
[00:36:45.623 --> 00:36:46.544]  We just called him this morning.
[00:36:46.564 --> 00:36:48.325]  My producer said, call Steve, let's get him on.
[00:36:50.667 --> 00:36:58.513]  I don't know what his view on this bird flu situation, swine flu, slash human flu, transgenic, mutagen or whatever it is.
[00:36:59.113 --> 00:36:59.974]  So that's coming up again.
[00:37:00.014 --> 00:37:05.239]  I want to hear Dr. Dease take on it as well now that I talked to him last night, but a lot's happened since we had him on at like 530 Central.
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:11.605]  Before we go any further though, my solar backup, a lot of things can cut off your electrical power, hurricanes, snow, ice storms.
[00:37:12.146 --> 00:37:14.928]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that.
[00:37:15.789 --> 00:37:19.773]  A solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[00:37:20.133 --> 00:37:23.677]  It's designed to provide 1,800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[00:37:23.957 --> 00:37:31.444]  You get an emergency power backup kit, which consists of the power source 1,800 power plant, a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity,
[00:37:32.125 --> 00:37:33.286]  It generates free electricity.
[00:37:33.326 --> 00:37:35.247]  Remember, too, that gas stations need gas.
[00:37:35.547 --> 00:37:38.968]  But in the blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[00:37:39.389 --> 00:37:42.490]  The solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:44.871]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[00:37:44.891 --> 00:37:46.812]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks.
[00:37:47.173 --> 00:37:48.433]  So make your move now.
[00:37:48.733 --> 00:37:49.934]  MySolarBackup.com.
[00:37:49.954 --> 00:37:50.914]  That's My Solar Backup.
[00:37:51.015 --> 00:37:51.375]  One word.
[00:37:51.655 --> 00:37:53.156]  MySolarBackup.com or give them a call.
[00:37:53.176 --> 00:37:53.216]  877-327-0365.
[00:37:53.236 --> 00:37:53.556]  877-327-0365.
[00:37:53.576 --> 00:37:55.697]  And one more sponsor I wanted to tell you about.
[00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:08.852]  that is making this radio show possible are the fine folks at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:38:08.932 --> 00:38:11.953]  Clean, healthy, non-GMO, non-hybrid food.
[00:38:12.273 --> 00:38:13.354]  The lowest prices out there.
[00:38:13.374 --> 00:38:16.815]  These are the biggest storable foods companies in the nation, so they pass those savings on to you.
[00:38:18.032 --> 00:38:22.394]  And just a fabulous high-quality food from Utah, the folks that wrote the book on this.
[00:38:23.254 --> 00:38:39.381]  eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com, the letter eFoodsDirect.com, or 800-409-5633, with all the things the New World Order is doing, with that history of criminality of the global elite, and the things they do, and the fact that they don't want you to have storable food or drink.
[00:38:39.781 --> 00:38:41.723]  Filtered water or own firearms.
[00:38:41.783 --> 00:38:43.005]  They want you dependent.
[00:38:43.025 --> 00:38:44.106]  They want you broke back.
[00:38:44.607 --> 00:38:48.791]  The great way to be self-sufficient is to get high quality food at efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:38:48.811 --> 00:38:49.292]  800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com.
[00:38:55.038 --> 00:39:08.288]  Okay, I really want to hear, now that he's had more time to look at this, because nobody talks and writes about bird flu more than Dr. Deagle, who is a medical doctor, and if you go over his bio, it is lengthy.
[00:39:08.328 --> 00:39:21.438]  I think it's probably better, Dr. Deagle, plus I just had your bio here in front of me, there's so much going on, if you tell the listeners a little bit about yourself, because you particularly worked in a lot of these areas.
[00:39:21.478 --> 00:39:21.719]  In fact,
[00:39:22.964 --> 00:39:23.865]  I had known this.
[00:39:24.165 --> 00:39:25.226]  I'd heard it from another doctor.
[00:39:25.246 --> 00:39:28.228]  It was actually a biologist, but I didn't believe it.
[00:39:28.468 --> 00:39:30.149]  I believed him, but I just couldn't believe it.
[00:39:30.609 --> 00:39:34.252]  And you were on the show about a year ago, and you said, yeah, look at how they make aspartame.
[00:39:34.992 --> 00:39:46.140]  It is a specially engineered bacteria's excrement, is what aspartame is, and they feed toxic chemicals to the bacteria, the E. coli.
[00:39:47.867 --> 00:40:00.190]  And then it, so they feed a crap-eating bacteria, chemicals, and then it defecates out, I hate to talk about this, this is what the New World Order is into, a toxic chemical.
[00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:04.651]  And so this is a by-law, and I'd heard this and read this and didn't believe it.
[00:40:05.071 --> 00:40:06.852]  Then I googled that day, a year ago,
[00:40:08.476 --> 00:40:10.357]  Aspartame manufacturing process.
[00:40:10.398 --> 00:40:11.038]  Do that right now.
[00:40:11.078 --> 00:40:12.099]  This is a side issue.
[00:40:12.499 --> 00:40:19.884]  And it was exactly, with photos and videos, what Deagle said he saw 20 years ago at a factory when he was getting a tour of a vaccine facility.
[00:40:19.905 --> 00:40:21.125]  I think he said he worked there, I forget.
[00:40:21.746 --> 00:40:28.851]  And separate from the vaccine facility on another VAC-40 was their huge aspartame facility and it was black sludge.
[00:40:29.652 --> 00:40:31.753]  Well folks, you can go online and look at the black sludge.
[00:40:32.093 --> 00:40:33.735]  Just give me an example of how crazy it is.
[00:40:34.315 --> 00:40:38.618]  Since 1981 when they approved this, you are eating E. coli crap.
[00:40:39.398 --> 00:40:40.479]  That is aspartame.
[00:40:40.899 --> 00:40:42.080]  Now in over 10,000 products.
[00:40:42.801 --> 00:40:45.342]  Dr. D., you want to tell folks briefly about that and then your bio?
[00:40:46.443 --> 00:40:48.704]  Yeah, I'll try to be the bio real brief.
[00:40:49.125 --> 00:40:57.130]  My background before I went into medicine in the 70s was I was trained in infectious disease and worked under a bio-weaponer, Dr. Robert Brown.
[00:40:58.451 --> 00:40:58.831]  In the 1997,
[00:41:02.752 --> 00:41:10.397]  I spoke at Human Life International in Zurich, Switzerland, on the Super Soldier program, which they tried to recruit me at UCLA in 1978.
[00:41:11.037 --> 00:41:12.378]  I turned them down.
[00:41:12.398 --> 00:41:21.524]  And I also spoke against fetal tissue transplantation, which was projects going on all across America, from Boulder to U of Texas, etc.
[00:41:22.425 --> 00:41:27.768]  And after my talk, they gave me, plunked down in front of me, a foot of documents about three projects.
[00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:30.810]  The first two projects were the plasmid
[00:41:31.754 --> 00:41:42.058]  Genetically engineered tetanus vaccine was to create antibodies to cause first trimester abortions, primarily to reduce the population by causing a spontaneous miscarriage in women.
[00:41:42.598 --> 00:41:51.662]  The second project was a special virus project, which they also tried to recruit me in 1974 to go to Uganda for the CIA and finish my PhD in virology.
[00:41:52.202 --> 00:41:53.002]  I turned them down.
[00:41:53.483 --> 00:41:57.444]  This project was a mycobacteria, which is carrying an RNA retrovirus.
[00:41:57.464 --> 00:41:59.345]  The virus is, in fact, genetically
[00:41:59.906 --> 00:42:00.086]  I think?
[00:42:16.934 --> 00:42:17.854]  CDC, etc.
[00:42:18.074 --> 00:42:20.475]  But the most scary project... Let me just stop you for a moment.
[00:42:20.515 --> 00:42:34.859]  For those that don't know, and this sounds ridiculous, I'm trying to recruit him, that's who the CIA recruits is doctors, is scientists, because these are professionals that have proven they can follow orders and carry out complex procedures.
[00:42:35.279 --> 00:42:43.061]  My dad is a dentist and oral surgeon, and they tried to recruit him and a bunch of other Dallas top of their class oral surgeons
[00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:46.551]  Yeah, they look for people that have a bent toward doing research.
[00:42:46.571 --> 00:42:48.712]  A lot of doctors, only maybe 5% really like to do research.
[00:43:12.128 --> 00:43:16.950]  The rest of them just want to go off and do procedures and have a practice.
[00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:18.831]  My whole point is this is widespread.
[00:43:18.951 --> 00:43:20.251]  Oh yeah, this is standard.
[00:43:20.291 --> 00:43:22.092]  This is not an unusual thing.
[00:43:22.112 --> 00:43:23.813]  This is standard to call through.
[00:43:24.813 --> 00:43:26.554]  Just like the Rhodes Scholarship.
[00:43:26.574 --> 00:43:28.415]  They put 300 Rhodes Scholars through every year.
[00:43:28.435 --> 00:43:32.856]  10% when they do their psychological testing are a little bit psychotic.
[00:43:32.896 --> 00:43:34.097]  They're kind of strange.
[00:43:34.197 --> 00:43:35.457]  They'll do things no matter what.
[00:43:36.238 --> 00:43:37.198]  And they get a carte blanche.
[00:43:37.658 --> 00:43:39.379]  Now the third project was the most scary of all.
[00:43:39.399 --> 00:43:41.800]  And this was a project where they told me all the details.
[00:43:42.383 --> 00:43:55.415]  That they were actually going to exhume miners, whalers, I mean whalers from the 1918 pandemic in the permafrost, and they were going to take a gene bioengine with a supercomputer and rebuild the 1918 swine flu.
[00:43:56.416 --> 00:44:05.725]  That flu, by the way, also was a byproduct of a Bioweapons Project's vaccine project that was a typhus vaccine that they passed through pigs in Kansas.
[00:44:06.383 --> 00:44:08.745]  And it therefore had pig flu and human flu.
[00:44:08.765 --> 00:44:12.908]  And I went over the genetics letter by DNA letter with Dr. Henry L. Nyman three years ago.
[00:44:13.269 --> 00:44:19.133]  And by the way, they now admit that they have, with the Human Genome Project, rebuilt that flu.
[00:44:19.153 --> 00:44:27.020]  And I remember 12, 13 years ago, and this was first breaking in the late 90s, that it was rumored they were going to rebuild it.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.302]  Now they admit they have, but quote, for research.
[00:44:29.622 --> 00:44:29.842]  Yeah.
[00:44:29.902 --> 00:44:31.904]  And they actually, these are all in public documents now.
[00:44:31.944 --> 00:44:32.844]  I had it 1997, March 6th.
[00:44:32.924 --> 00:44:35.987]  It was given to me by these scientists and doctors.
[00:44:36.493 --> 00:44:38.955]  Who smuggled the documents out of the World Health Organization.
[00:44:39.515 --> 00:44:44.919]  They were going to take this and then they were going to add avian genes and insert it into the bird population in Asia.
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:52.785]  And then they were going to later, quote, cause the release of bridging viruses that will allow it to jump into humans and other animals.
[00:44:53.526 --> 00:44:54.487]  That's just happened.
[00:44:54.527 --> 00:45:01.652]  Now whether this wave is the big one, I don't know, but I can tell you what Napolitano is telling us that watch out for the next wave.
[00:45:02.176 --> 00:45:04.017]  There's almost certainly at least two substrains.
[00:45:04.057 --> 00:45:05.679]  The one in America is not very lethal.
[00:45:05.699 --> 00:45:07.320]  It's like a bad flu.
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:15.486]  But the one in Mexico City, if there's hundreds dead, or even a hundred dead out of, say, two thousand, that's a pretty high lethality rate.
[00:45:15.926 --> 00:45:19.068]  Is that because it's been there longer and mutated into a worse?
[00:45:19.469 --> 00:45:20.670]  Well, it could be several reasons.
[00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:23.392]  Or is it because they're sick down there and aren't healthy?
[00:45:23.712 --> 00:45:30.477]  Well, when you're unhealthy, you see, you have more free radicals in your body, or if you're exposed to toxins, like Dr. Tenpenny said, if you want to take a virus,
[00:45:31.018 --> 00:45:41.684]  And you want to make that virus mutate and become more aggressive, you can insert it into an animal and actually inject the animal with toxins or poisons, and it'll actually make that virus more aggressive and it'll make it mutate faster.
[00:45:42.564 --> 00:45:46.946]  So, what's probably happening is a simple process of recombination.
[00:45:47.046 --> 00:45:57.772]  We know that they inserted the H5N1 under specific genes, so when the genetics come out, there's a gene deletion on the PB2 gene that makes it completely bypass interleukin-4 in all mammals.
[00:45:58.188 --> 00:45:59.669]  So there's no warning system at all.
[00:45:59.689 --> 00:46:00.790]  It's even worse than in 1918.
[00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:05.593]  So it gets through the defenses of the body, and I want you to get back into that in the time before Steve Quill comes up.
[00:46:05.893 --> 00:46:21.885]  But the key here is, every doctor I've talked to on and off air is saying, and they'll especially say off air, on air they say it's suspicious, off air they say, no way the way this virus is set up with pig, human, and bird, this thing is designer.
[00:46:22.205 --> 00:46:31.848]  Yeah, I can visualize in my mind that they had a lab truck spraying it around Mexico City or the favelas around it, the slums, where you have sickened and weak populations.
[00:46:32.349 --> 00:46:36.430]  But the fact is that now the bird populations in all continents now have these lethal genes.
[00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:40.652]  It's going to bridge from birds, say, to cattle, humans, pigs, God knows what.
[00:46:41.232 --> 00:46:42.992]  And this is the first of many waves.
[00:46:43.132 --> 00:46:46.714]  In the steamship age, it took months for the next wave to happen.
[00:46:47.274 --> 00:46:50.435]  My grandmother lost a brother and a sister, and the little sister died.
[00:46:51.149 --> 00:46:51.369]  I think?
[00:47:11.877 --> 00:47:23.526]  To warn people, when they keep telling you there's going to be an avian flu pandemic, and a lot of doctors didn't believe it, I had the inside documents, I had the genetics, I had the background on infectious disease, they were doing everything they can to create it.
[00:47:23.586 --> 00:47:25.148]  It wouldn't happen spontaneously.
[00:47:25.528 --> 00:47:33.975]  They now have released the bridging virus, which is this new super hybrid, and future waves, if this is not the big one, are going to come, and they're going to come quickly.
[00:47:35.652 --> 00:47:40.734]  Now, normally they say a virus peaks in about 90 days, but I mean, they all vary.
[00:47:40.914 --> 00:47:42.194]  It all depends on the genetics.
[00:47:42.214 --> 00:47:43.275]  You see, this is going to recombine.
[00:47:43.315 --> 00:47:44.315]  It's this strain.
[00:47:44.675 --> 00:47:46.576]  The one in America seems to be relatively mild.
[00:47:46.596 --> 00:47:47.516]  We don't have anybody dead.
[00:47:47.556 --> 00:47:52.678]  But in Mexico City, and as it changes and recombines, it can recombine very quickly.
[00:47:52.738 --> 00:47:55.539]  But how do we know that it's not the same virus, it's just that they're
[00:47:55.779 --> 00:47:57.339]  We don't know because they won't release the data.
[00:47:57.359 --> 00:47:58.200]  They never release the data.
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:05.522]  They are acting very secretive and I've had call after call on and off air from Mexico where they say 70% of the people they know are sick.
[00:48:05.542 --> 00:48:09.263]  You go to the hospital, people are vomiting everywhere, blood coming out their noses.
[00:48:10.423 --> 00:48:11.983]  And this is similar to what we saw in 1918.
[00:48:12.043 --> 00:48:12.343]  Right.
[00:48:12.424 --> 00:48:15.164]  It causes a hemorrhagic diastasis.
[00:48:15.264 --> 00:48:16.545]  It causes a cytokine storm.
[00:48:16.985 --> 00:48:19.866]  And if it's bad enough, the stronger your immune system, the more deadly it is.
[00:48:20.606 --> 00:48:23.427]  So that's why people need to pay attention.
[00:48:23.487 --> 00:48:25.147]  It's not just how bad this is now.
[00:48:25.734 --> 00:48:28.095]  It's that the virus is then going to get into other animals.
[00:48:28.835 --> 00:48:30.856]  Dogs, cats, birds.
[00:48:31.256 --> 00:48:39.439]  And as it recombines there, because it has a receptor binding domain to get back to humans, we now have a returning vector system where it can get into cattle.
[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:40.940]  It can get into people's pets.
[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:50.944]  We already have a pandemic where birds all over the world... I have reports from game wardens in British Columbia, from Washington State, from Oregon... Pigs are dying all over the United States.
[00:48:50.964 --> 00:48:51.504]  Exactly.
[00:48:51.684 --> 00:48:52.825]  That's in the mainstream news.
[00:48:53.519 --> 00:49:12.268]  Right, so now we have the proof that there is a pandemic in birds, there's now a pandemic in pigs, and the likelihood is that when this recombines in future waves, and they've done this because their plan is, and they were told me this in these documents, these physicians gave me these documents, said this is to reduce the world population by at least 2 billion.
[00:49:13.289 --> 00:49:13.509]  Okay?
[00:49:13.951 --> 00:49:15.472]  They are doing everything.
[00:49:15.492 --> 00:49:16.452]  They're behind schedule.
[00:49:16.752 --> 00:49:17.913]  All of the public documents.
[00:49:17.973 --> 00:49:25.777]  And they use their staged terror attacks at 9-11 to put the control grid in, to tell you it's for brown-skinned guys in caves.
[00:49:26.217 --> 00:49:29.819]  And now they admit, oh, this homeland security is for you, the gun owners.
[00:49:30.099 --> 00:49:32.240]  You're the number one threat to veterans.
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:39.824]  So they need us to be straight-jacketed and to be listed as the enemies, so when they move with a mass plague, we stand down.
[00:49:40.224 --> 00:49:40.684]  Exactly.
[00:49:40.724 --> 00:49:43.606]  And their whole idea is the statement by
[00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:56.873]  Kissinger just a few weeks ago was that the American public will be disarmed by September, because they plan on waves between now and September that'll be sufficient, that'll be, basically will protect you if you'll pass in your guns and come to our civil detention camps.
[00:49:57.473 --> 00:50:13.336]  And right now the strain is supposedly sensitive to ozoltamivir, or Tamiflu, which of course Mr. Satan himself has shares in it, Rumsfeld, but the fact is that it's going to require resistance extremely fast within days, so it's useless.
[00:50:13.806 --> 00:50:15.007]  Vaccines will be useless.
[00:50:15.027 --> 00:50:16.607]  This will continue to mutate and change.
[00:50:16.948 --> 00:50:22.370]  The only thing is self-quarantine at home, and of course a whole series of nutraceuticals, and they can check with me on that.
[00:50:22.671 --> 00:50:23.971]  But there are things that will block it.
[00:50:24.431 --> 00:50:33.716]  The government could have installed a system called Aeroclave, which was developed with Homeland Security, but they haven't done it to actually cure all aircraft.
[00:50:33.736 --> 00:50:37.218]  They could have had a biohazard center for disease control.
[00:50:37.258 --> 00:50:38.118]  Do masks help?
[00:50:38.258 --> 00:50:40.039]  Yes, you need a nanomask.
[00:50:40.059 --> 00:50:41.220]  You need a nanoparticle mask.
[00:50:41.897 --> 00:50:44.738]  Regular droplet masks that the doctors and nurses have won't do anything.
[00:50:45.158 --> 00:50:47.559]  That's why it didn't stop the coronavirus or SARS.
[00:50:48.079 --> 00:50:56.581]  This is going to be a really big mess, because the doctors are not trained how to do infectious control properly, and they will have casualties.
[00:50:56.841 --> 00:50:58.682]  But even a regular mask reduces some.
[00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:00.703]  I mean, it'll block a larger... A little bit.
[00:51:00.963 --> 00:51:05.024]  I mean, because the virus will be within a... Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:05.044 --> 00:51:07.805]  It's going to block some, but you want to have... Thank you, Dr. Diegel.
[00:51:07.825 --> 00:51:08.745]  We'll talk to you again tomorrow.
[00:51:10.216 --> 00:51:12.078]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.
[00:51:12.398 --> 00:51:19.264]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource on earth because it will provide healthy food now and every year after.

[00:52:10.712 --> 00:52:16.021]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:16.542 --> 00:52:23.534]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:24.088 --> 00:52:30.270]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:32.510]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:35.071]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:46.094]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:46.738 --> 00:52:48.019]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:48.399 --> 00:52:49.799]  It's about a one world government.
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:56.582]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:53:05.426 --> 00:53:06.586]  The Obama Deception.
[00:53:07.006 --> 00:53:08.187]  The people strike back.
[00:53:10.043 --> 00:53:11.545]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:53:11.725 --> 00:53:13.186]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:53:13.487 --> 00:53:15.709]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:53:16.149 --> 00:53:20.914]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:53:21.294 --> 00:53:24.157]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[00:54:33.122 --> 00:54:33.782]  Mass Graves.
[00:54:33.802 --> 00:54:37.364]  We'll talk about this with Steve Quayle coming up in the next hour.
[00:54:38.783 --> 00:54:42.284]  You know, you're not going to hear a full-spectrum analysis from every angle, every view.
[00:54:42.304 --> 00:54:45.565]  We're really getting a truly diverse analysis.
[00:54:45.585 --> 00:54:47.306]  You're not going to hear that on mainstream news.
[00:54:47.326 --> 00:54:49.686]  They're just dumbing it down, trying to fearmonger.
[00:54:50.567 --> 00:54:55.868]  Tell you a bunch of Tamiflu is going to save you, and all it does is accelerate the mutations of the virus to a more deadly strain.
[00:54:58.029 --> 00:54:59.609]  So I would ask everybody to keep spreading the word.
[00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:03.971]  If you're listening to us on AM and FM right now, tell people at red lights, hey, tune into this station.
[00:55:04.958 --> 00:55:05.619]  Or on the internet.
[00:55:05.639 --> 00:55:09.221]  Tell your friends and family, tune in on the free streams at InfoWars.com.
[00:55:09.241 --> 00:55:17.266]  If you want to hear any of what we've just covered in the last two hours, fifty-five minutes, the whole four-hour show will be posted a little bit after the show today at InfoWars.com.
[00:55:17.286 --> 00:55:18.247]  You click on the listen button.
[00:55:18.727 --> 00:55:19.628]  It takes you to the listen page.
[00:55:19.648 --> 00:55:20.668]  There's the free podcast.
[00:55:21.028 --> 00:55:24.811]  Just copy that little bit of code, that link into your MP3, iPod device, whatever.
[00:55:26.092 --> 00:55:27.913]  Folks are putting these all over the web, posting everywhere.
[00:55:27.933 --> 00:55:29.274]  We appreciate that on the BitTorrents.
[00:55:29.854 --> 00:55:33.697]  Because we're really, you know,
[00:55:34.844 --> 00:55:39.005]  Not fear-mongering one-tenth of the mainstream media.
[00:55:39.325 --> 00:55:41.526]  I mean, this is scary by the very nature of reporting it.
[00:55:41.546 --> 00:55:46.007]  It conjures up scary fears because the flu has killed hundreds of millions of people in the last century.
[00:55:46.608 --> 00:55:48.628]  Forty million of those just in one year in 1918.
[00:55:49.649 --> 00:55:52.930]  And we know the globalists are a bunch of eugenicists and are very, very dangerous and have a history of this.
[00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:54.150]  So we've got to watch them.
[00:55:54.170 --> 00:56:00.752]  We know they've been gearing up for martial law and global takeover and to bring in the North American Union out of a flu or smallpox outbreak.
[00:56:02.553 --> 00:56:03.813]  So there's a lot going on here.
[00:56:07.594 --> 00:56:12.018]  But we're trying to get people to be calm and to not mind all the hype.
[00:56:12.299 --> 00:56:13.660]  It looks like this is all just hype.
[00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:16.663]  But if it does mutate into something, Katie, bar the door.
[00:56:17.243 --> 00:56:19.245]  Let's go to calls over here on this phone system.
[00:56:19.846 --> 00:56:24.671]  Oh wait, you pulled up the manufacturing process of aspartame there.
[00:56:27.233 --> 00:56:29.255]  See, it says the fermentation process.
[00:56:29.716 --> 00:56:30.516]  It's a nice way of putting it.
[00:56:30.877 --> 00:56:31.918]  With the E. coli.
[00:56:33.439 --> 00:56:45.781]  And then they feed them the toxic waste, literally, they feed them chemicals, and then the E. coli, genetically engineered E. coli, to be able to eat the chemicals, they then put out what you think is so sweet and delicious.
[00:56:50.102 --> 00:56:51.363]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:56:51.863 --> 00:56:55.904]  They call it the seed tank, provides an ideal environment for growing more bacteria.
[00:56:56.224 --> 00:57:03.085]  It is filled with things bacteria need to thrive, including warm water, carbohydrate foods, and it goes on and on and on.
[00:57:07.927 --> 00:57:09.448]  You tell people that and they just don't believe it.
[00:57:09.468 --> 00:57:11.730]  If you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, you can see it.
[00:57:12.551 --> 00:57:14.092]  Let's go to Nicolette in Ohio.
[00:57:14.132 --> 00:57:15.193]  Nicolette, thank you for holding.
[00:57:17.435 --> 00:57:18.716]  I have a couple of questions.
[00:57:19.096 --> 00:57:24.861]  The first one, have you heard about what's going on up here in Ohio and the little FEMA exercise with First Energy on the 29th?
[00:57:25.922 --> 00:57:27.884]  There's a lot of FEMA takeover drills.
[00:57:31.314 --> 00:57:31.594]  Echo.
[00:57:31.734 --> 00:57:35.857]  Okay, Echo.
[00:57:36.117 --> 00:57:39.979]  I'm sorry.
[00:57:40.459 --> 00:57:40.959]  Ma'am, you there?
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000]  Yes, I'm still here.
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:47.003]  Okay, go ahead and tell me about the particular drill.
[00:57:48.263 --> 00:57:53.406]  Okay, this particular drill starts on Wednesday up here and it's through First Energy.
[00:57:53.426 --> 00:57:58.389]  They have 4.5 million customers here in Ohio and they're
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:07.865]  They've suggested that their employees go to this training drill and it's on the JimmyOnTheSpot.com.
[00:58:07.925 --> 00:58:10.207]  It's actually on your Prison Planet forum.
[00:58:10.267 --> 00:58:12.989]  It's just this large article about what's going to be happening up here.
[00:58:13.009 --> 00:58:24.696]  Yeah, I actually have a FEMA drill document with nationwide drive-thru injectors and Walmart's doing drills where you drive through and they go, thank you.
[00:58:25.036 --> 00:58:25.917]  Tell you what, stay there.
[00:58:26.437 --> 00:58:27.518]  Can you hold some more, Nicolette?
[00:58:28.342 --> 00:58:28.462]  Sure.
[00:58:28.502 --> 00:58:32.863]  Alright, because I'm going to bring Steve Quayle up, but we'll take calls while Steve is on with us.
[00:58:32.883 --> 00:58:36.344]  From Nicolette, Sherry, Dave, Carter, George, you've been holding this long, why not stay?
[00:58:36.684 --> 00:58:43.345]  Nathan, Leo, Bill, Dominique, JD, I've got two different phone systems here, and we'll see if I can get to these calls.
[00:58:43.805 --> 00:58:46.386]  Alright, we continue to go onward through the fog.
[00:58:46.766 --> 00:58:48.346]  Steve Quayle, straight ahead.
[00:58:48.406 --> 00:58:48.946]  Stay with us.
[00:58:48.966 --> 00:58:54.127]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:54.667 --> 00:58:57.608]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:00.134 --> 00:59:01.716]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:59:01.816 --> 00:59:06.461]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:59:06.561 --> 00:59:09.345]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:09.525 --> 00:59:12.388]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:12.568 --> 00:59:18.435]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:59:18.635 --> 00:59:21.578]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:21.878 --> 00:59:28.805]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:28.885 --> 00:59:31.988]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:59:32.148 --> 00:59:34.050]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.661]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:48.681 --> 00:59:49.282]  Take action today.
[00:59:49.302 --> 00:59:51.283]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:00:02.978 --> 01:00:04.879]  Waging War on Corruption.
[01:00:05.359 --> 01:00:08.341]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:20.947]  We interrupt this program with a special bulletin.
[01:00:21.067 --> 01:00:24.769]  America is now under martial law.
[01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:30.972]  All constitutional rights have been suspended.
[01:00:31.744 --> 01:00:32.964]  Stay in your home.
[01:00:33.745 --> 01:00:40.187]  Do not attempt to contact loved ones, insurance agents, or attorneys.
[01:00:41.568 --> 01:00:42.928]  Shut up!
[01:00:43.048 --> 01:00:47.190]  Do not attempt to think or depression may occur.
[01:00:50.197 --> 01:00:51.277]  Curfew is at 7 p.m.
[01:00:51.378 --> 01:00:54.039]  sharp after work.
[01:00:54.959 --> 01:01:03.182]  Anyone caught outside the gates of their subdivision sectors after curfew will be shot.
[01:01:04.343 --> 01:01:05.303]  Remain calm.
[01:01:06.344 --> 01:01:07.204]  Do not panic.
[01:01:08.124 --> 01:01:14.487]  Your neighborhood watch officer will be by to collect urine samples in the morning.
[01:01:15.871 --> 01:01:23.275]  Anyone caught interfering with the collection of urine samples will be shot.
[01:01:24.076 --> 01:01:25.676]  Stay in your homes.
[01:01:26.557 --> 01:01:27.998]  Remain calm.
[01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:32.820]  The number one enemy of progress is questions.
[01:01:33.741 --> 01:01:39.024]  National security is more important than individual will.
[01:01:40.431 --> 01:01:44.572]  All sports broadcasts will proceed as normal.
[01:01:45.553 --> 01:01:50.434]  No more than two people may gather anywhere without permission.
[01:01:50.634 --> 01:01:55.575]  Use only the drugs prescribed by your boss or supervisor.
[01:01:57.076 --> 01:01:57.396]  Shut up!
[01:01:58.396 --> 01:01:59.776]  Be happy!
[01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:02.217]  Obey all orders without question.
[01:02:02.837 --> 01:02:06.038]  The comfort you've demanded is now mandatory.
[01:02:06.898 --> 01:02:07.519]  Be happy!
[01:02:08.259 --> 01:02:08.639]  At last!
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.182]  Everything is done for you!
[01:02:15.105 --> 01:02:17.907]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[01:02:17.947 --> 01:02:20.510]  We have 58 minutes left in transmission.
[01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:21.951]  I may even do a bit of overdrive today.
[01:02:22.511 --> 01:02:32.700]  Syndicated talk show host, a best-selling author, research for Steve Quayle, who just last Monday on air said he thinks a stage flu epidemic was in the works, and that he had intel on that.
[01:02:33.301 --> 01:02:35.142]  And then look at what broke four or five days later.
[01:02:36.443 --> 01:02:42.407]  We've had a big 6.0 earthquake in Mexico City on top of things to make things even crazier.
[01:02:43.007 --> 01:02:52.373]  And Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, medical doctor who runs a clinic in Mexico down there in Monterey, had a huge conference at a five-star hotel there at that medical city, one of the most lavish in the world.
[01:02:52.393 --> 01:02:55.875]  They fly in from Saudi Arabia, you name it, the U.S., to go to that medical center.
[01:02:56.215 --> 01:02:56.976]  That's been shut down.
[01:02:56.996 --> 01:03:02.239]  They've been told, you fly out of the country, we don't take this plane, we're going to put you on a bus and make you leave tomorrow.
[01:03:03.547 --> 01:03:10.213]  So all of that happening, the media hyping this, hyping this, and then saying, well, this may not be it, but another big one is coming.
[01:03:10.694 --> 01:03:11.294]  Get ready.
[01:03:11.815 --> 01:03:21.104]  And then we know the last few big flus broke out at military bases, the one that killed 40 million in 1918, and the 1976 one they used for forced inoculations that killed a bunch of people.
[01:03:21.644 --> 01:03:25.188]  Steve Quayle, we're about to break, but thanks for joining us on short notice.
[01:03:25.728 --> 01:03:27.470]  What's your inside scoop on what's happening?
[01:03:28.168 --> 01:03:44.695]  Well Alex, your emergency broadcast Saturday night was very well timed because the same control mechanism that was set up in the air, airborne command for martial law, basically ordered a stand down of all HF frequencies with the military.
[01:03:44.735 --> 01:03:45.295]  In other words,
[01:03:45.894 --> 01:03:48.096]  This is not the big event.
[01:03:48.156 --> 01:03:49.517]  This is the initiating event.
[01:03:49.557 --> 01:03:53.420]  This is the igniter event that's going to push us right there.
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:57.282]  And I gotta tell you, Alex, this is not just something that's going to go away.
[01:03:57.723 --> 01:04:06.389]  Because with the World Health Organization and all the different shills and the mouthpieces for the CDC and mainstream news, remember, this is the agenda.
[01:04:06.429 --> 01:04:11.513]  Back in, I think you've already talked about this, but back in the Air Force study that was written in, what was it?
[01:04:14.255 --> 01:04:22.378]  Yeah, let me stop you there.
[01:04:22.398 --> 01:04:36.045]  That was in my stack, and I got so busy in the last three hours, that was one of my top stories, and I never even got to it, because I'm trying to not scare people.
[01:04:37.205 --> 01:04:40.607]  I'm trying to get some calm here, but I think people are owed to know the fact
[01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:44.849]  This was written in March 5th, 2009, so a month and a half ago.
[01:04:45.269 --> 01:04:48.810]  Kurt Nemo, with links to the now declassified documents, U.S.
[01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:55.413]  Air Force Study proposed a 2009 influenza pandemic for just this time of year.
[01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:59.115]  So Steve, we'll get your expert analysis on that straight ahead.
[01:04:59.175 --> 01:05:02.576]  Yeah, I got a bad feeling about all this, and I agree with Steve.
[01:05:02.596 --> 01:05:06.978]  This is the initiator for something big, as Homeland Security had chortled and said.
[01:05:07.318 --> 01:05:08.839]  Steve Quayle is our guest.
[01:05:08.859 --> 01:05:09.279]  Stay with us.
[01:05:10.552 --> 01:05:13.815]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:05:14.055 --> 01:05:18.378]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[01:05:18.578 --> 01:05:26.464]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:29.610]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:37.432]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:05:37.532 --> 01:05:43.094]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:05:43.334 --> 01:05:48.896]  ProtoGro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:05:49.176 --> 01:05:52.477]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:05:52.738 --> 01:05:56.079]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:05:56.319 --> 01:06:01.361]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Chief Superfoods should visit the ProtoGro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:06:01.381 --> 01:06:04.262]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:06:04.302 --> 01:06:04.482]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:06:10.706 --> 01:06:16.012]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:16.533 --> 01:06:23.521]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:06:24.102 --> 01:06:30.269]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:30.689 --> 01:06:32.531]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:32.651 --> 01:06:35.073]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:35.153 --> 01:06:46.122]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:46.742 --> 01:06:48.023]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:48.423 --> 01:06:49.805]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:06:50.265 --> 01:06:56.510]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:06:57.176 --> 01:07:04.921]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:05.422 --> 01:07:06.563]  The Obama Deception.
[01:07:07.003 --> 01:07:08.204]  The people strike back!
[01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:15.155]  As the economy continues to plummet, many of us will have to make difficult choices and cut back on our expenses.
[01:07:15.676 --> 01:07:18.239]  One thing we cannot afford to cut back on, though, is our health.
[01:07:18.639 --> 01:07:25.308]  If you suffer from chronic illness, stress, weak immune health, or just feel tired, you need to visit Shentrition.com.
[01:07:25.748 --> 01:07:29.493]  Shentrition is an innovative supplement that stimulates the healing power of the body.
[01:07:30.053 --> 01:07:31.714]  Shentrition is made up of two parts.
[01:07:32.094 --> 01:07:35.535]  The first part is superfoods, alkalizing greens and hemp protein.
[01:07:35.735 --> 01:07:39.817]  The second half contains a powerful herbal formula to heal and detoxify the body.
[01:07:40.197 --> 01:07:45.519]  The philosophy at Shentrition is to feed the body what it needs and heal the body with food in one product.
[01:07:45.779 --> 01:07:50.741]  Shentrition is all-natural, wheat-free, dairy-free and 100% vegetarian.
[01:07:51.142 --> 01:07:55.884]  Discover the ancient secrets to healing, wellness and longevity at Shentrition.com.
[01:07:56.164 --> 01:07:59.185]  That's S-H-E-N-T-R-I-T-I-O-N.
[01:07:59.565 --> 01:08:02.187]  I've been attempting the last three hours and eight minutes.
[01:08:26.033 --> 01:08:29.495]  To just give you all sides, all angles, all possibilities.
[01:08:30.496 --> 01:08:39.941]  Did the Mexican government hide just a normal flu release to create fear, to kind of nip in the bud the revolution that was online to overthrow the government by this summer?
[01:08:42.022 --> 01:08:44.443]  Well, the problem is they're certainly using it for that.
[01:08:45.024 --> 01:08:52.708]  The problem here, though, is that this is three different flus, bird, pig, human mixed, from all over the world.
[01:08:52.768 --> 01:08:54.349]  It always comes out of Asia.
[01:08:56.923 --> 01:08:58.584]  And there's two different flu seasons in the world.
[01:08:58.624 --> 01:08:59.705]  Their season and our season.
[01:08:59.725 --> 01:09:01.406]  It always comes from there, always.
[01:09:01.767 --> 01:09:03.468]  Now it's appeared in Mexico.
[01:09:05.429 --> 01:09:11.754]  The reports we're getting, and it's been confirmed by BBC and others, is there's a lot more deaths than they're saying, a lot more illnesses than they're saying.
[01:09:12.174 --> 01:09:13.115]  But flu does that.
[01:09:13.195 --> 01:09:15.997]  It kills 15,000 plus Americans every year and tens of thousands of Mexicans.
[01:09:16.017 --> 01:09:18.899]  Because they have less health care, even though there's less people down there.
[01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:21.241]  A hundred million per capita, but more die down there.
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:28.322]  Well, first of all, the 1918 Spanish flu virus was cultivated by cadavers when specific teams from Fort Detrick and other countries went to areas where
[01:09:51.238 --> 01:09:53.620]  No, no, you've been saying that for over a decade everywhere.
[01:10:12.839 --> 01:10:13.079]  Yes.
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:22.126]  So the point is, is that based on my information, listen, what most people don't understand is that the biological weapons now are race-specific.
[01:10:22.146 --> 01:10:31.173]  And I want to cover this, I don't know if you've already covered this, but about a decade ago, one of the most famous bioengineer scientists was arrested in South Africa.
[01:10:31.613 --> 01:10:33.174]  And HIV has been reverse-engineered.
[01:10:33.434 --> 01:10:36.195]  That's why it's hundreds of times
[01:10:46.838 --> 01:10:56.565]  More deadly to blacks especially because they have the coupler points for it to plug in on and pure northern Europeans do not even have it.
[01:10:56.906 --> 01:11:05.232]  That's why they've got studies in BBC just a few months ago about Italians, southern Italians, that have had a big African influx over the past few thousand years.
[01:11:05.832 --> 01:11:12.297]  Southern Italians are very susceptible to HIV but northern Italians, which are really Austrians basically, can't get it.
[01:11:13.115 --> 01:11:13.455]  Absolutely.
[01:11:13.495 --> 01:11:15.096]  Now, here's what I want people to understand.
[01:11:15.216 --> 01:11:21.260]  Understand this, that you're going to be sent a massive amount of mixed signals.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.821]  Number one, it isn't genetic altered.
[01:11:22.861 --> 01:11:23.421]  Yes, it is.
[01:11:23.902 --> 01:11:25.663]  Nothing in nature has it.
[01:11:25.743 --> 01:11:34.669]  Now, Alex, this specific strain and the strain that will come thereafter and the mutant variations in between, imagine having tentacles on the
[01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:36.630]  We're good to go.
[01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:05.804]  On Saturday, when you were doing your emergency broadcast, the entire command and control for martial law goes up in an airborne command structure.
[01:12:06.384 --> 01:12:10.326]  They ordered every... That's the five doomsday planes, which they now admit, were activated.
[01:12:10.346 --> 01:12:16.789]  They told folks Sunday morning and admitted they initiated the martial law control grant under the executive orders.
[01:12:16.829 --> 01:12:17.089]  Go ahead.
[01:12:17.569 --> 01:12:18.209]  Absolutely.
[01:12:18.650 --> 01:12:30.156]  But what you don't know is that while you were on the air, the order went out to literally every single military, let's say, asset that was on HF High Frequency was told to get off.
[01:12:30.296 --> 01:12:35.259]  At the same time, every state's emergency communications network was activated.
[01:12:35.319 --> 01:12:41.382]  So when people think, Alex, that this is just a bunch of brouhaha that has no relevance, that's how serious it was.
[01:12:41.843 --> 01:12:43.784]  What people, you need to understand,
[01:12:44.284 --> 01:12:52.405]  That what was going on Saturday night was the entire command and control structure ready to go at a moment's notice.
[01:12:52.926 --> 01:12:55.306]  Alex, what I'm concerned about, first and foremost, is this.
[01:12:55.346 --> 01:13:04.648]  No one has done more investigation in the public sector with the assets that are available than I have in the genetically altered modification of viruses.
[01:13:05.148 --> 01:13:11.729]  From the time Mad Cow first broke out, I said, listen, this is going to be used as a bioweapon prior to it being released in Great Britain.
[01:13:12.089 --> 01:13:20.092]  I said, when you've got guys down in New Guinea checking out the headhunters for the disease called Kuru, I said, you can bet your bottom line somebody's developed a bioweapon.
[01:13:20.332 --> 01:13:28.855]  The thing that concerns me the most is the art and antiquities guy in Mexico that died 12 hours later after shaking Barack Obama's hand.
[01:13:29.356 --> 01:13:39.699]  The fact that we don't know, you know, the expedient nature of his death or how long he may have been exposed prior to dying is telltale to me.
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:41.040]  Again, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:55.495]  Ten years ago, I wrote the book, Breathe No Evil, and Alex, given the 1996 report, given what's going on, given everything that's taking place, this is the traditional shot fired across the good ship lollipop, USA.
[01:13:56.796 --> 01:13:58.077]  And people had better get serious.
[01:13:58.117 --> 01:13:59.958]  Now, here's something I think everybody's got to consider.
[01:14:00.378 --> 01:14:23.791]  If this is a specific race or genetic, excuse me, a race-specific or a genetically marked targeted group of people, a friend of mine, Doug McIntosh, just sent me an email saying, Steve, Cinco de Mayo is coming up, and if it is the race-specific bioweapon, then remember this, Alex, all you would need is people who could gather in large groups across the country who are
[01:14:24.551 --> 01:14:25.752]  We're good to go.
[01:14:41.339 --> 01:14:47.784]  Three of the most virulent pathogens that have ever been genetically tweaked in the history of this world.
[01:14:48.164 --> 01:14:59.593]  This is absolutely no exaggeration that this thing is being put forth in its initial phase as the initiating trigger to whatever else is out there.
[01:14:59.613 --> 01:15:00.974]  I want to tell you something about chemtrails.
[01:15:01.754 --> 01:15:04.618]  They can poo-poo everything they want to poo-poo about it.
[01:15:04.978 --> 01:15:20.918]  But when Chemtrail started having genetic binders incorporated into the barium and all the aluminum and everything else that they were spraying, the point that was obvious is that at some point, let's consider that a primary to a binary weapon,
[01:15:21.278 --> 01:15:31.103]  At some point, when the chemtrails change, then the susceptibility of the systems, the human immune system that's been worn down by the initial chemtrail, can be activated.
[01:15:31.203 --> 01:15:31.903]  That's one point.
[01:15:32.163 --> 01:15:42.528]  That's what you and others have always said, is that that is... What's the weapon system called, where they give you half of it, and then later give you the other half?
[01:15:42.648 --> 01:15:43.689]  Well, it's a binary.
[01:15:45.101 --> 01:16:01.943]  And so here's what's critical too, and people understanding this, you can literally take the CDC's reports and go back to when the chemtrails started, chemtrail spring started, following it through to when all the reports of how many respiratory diseases, and I'm getting every day with no exaggeration 20, 30, 40 emails
[01:16:03.626 --> 01:16:05.709]  People that are coming down with respiratory crud.
[01:16:06.049 --> 01:16:10.035]  Now, I think that this is... Well, that's what this flu does, is it causes people to die.
[01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:13.741]  Just like the 1918 swine flu or bird flu that killed so many.
[01:16:14.282 --> 01:16:15.684]  Spanish flu, if I got the name right.
[01:16:16.425 --> 01:16:18.028]  That one hit the respiratory system.
[01:16:18.582 --> 01:16:33.352]  Absolutely, but what is interesting to people is not only do they, when they, you buy a, when you're engineering a biological weapon, you absolutely, at the same time you are designing the weapon, you're designing the antidote or the vaccine, okay?
[01:16:33.752 --> 01:16:34.733]  We're good to go.
[01:16:52.495 --> 01:16:57.357]  And one of the signals is there are 751 flights out of Mexico City a day to points around the world.
[01:16:57.397 --> 01:16:57.938]  That's the number 13.
[01:16:57.978 --> 01:17:02.420]  The first announcement coming out of New Zealand was that there were 13 people infected.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:13.505]  If everybody knows their history of biological warfare, especially under the Second World War in Japan, you're dealing with Dr. Ishii and Unit 731, which some people said was more accurately called 751.
[01:17:15.146 --> 01:17:40.325]  Now, if you understand, too, the history of Mexico City and the whole Aztec Empire and everything, you've got to understand that there is a severe occult symbolism of meeting at the pyramids, of meeting at the key pyramid where more people were slain in a day than some armies were slain in a year of fighting in a world... And listen, this is very esoteric, but I knew you would bring this up because I was already thinking this and we're on the same track.
[01:17:40.925 --> 01:17:45.789]  You know, when I talk about weather weapons, seismic weapons, people would laugh, but it's now been declassified.
[01:17:45.809 --> 01:17:46.670]  It's not the details.
[01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:48.932]  Here is the news transcript, U.S.
[01:17:48.952 --> 01:17:49.913]  Department of Defense.
[01:17:50.753 --> 01:18:00.381]  If you Google DOD briefing, Secretary of Defense S. Cohen, earthquake weapons, it comes up, and here's the transcript of it, 1997.
[01:18:01.643 --> 01:18:02.864]  It's on screen right now.
[01:18:03.604 --> 01:18:03.924]  Let me
[01:18:06.499 --> 01:18:23.389]  He goes on to say, Alvin Toffler has written about this in terms of some scientists in their laboratories devise certain types of pathogens that would be ethnic-pacific so they could just eliminate certain ethnic groups and races, and others are designing some sort of engineering, some sort of insects that can destroy specific crops.
[01:18:23.890 --> 01:18:30.974]  Others are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate
[01:18:31.474 --> 01:18:35.838]  Set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.
[01:18:36.218 --> 01:18:41.282]  And this is what Dick Cheney then says in the September 20th, 2000, Rebuilding America's Defenses.
[01:18:41.922 --> 01:18:44.364]  We want to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[01:18:44.744 --> 01:18:45.145]  You have a 6.0.
[01:18:45.465 --> 01:18:47.226]  They haven't had one of those in years.
[01:18:47.967 --> 01:18:53.031]  And it's right on Mexico City, right as all this is happening.
[01:18:53.071 --> 01:18:53.591]  And you're right.
[01:18:53.831 --> 01:18:55.252]  This is a satanic center.
[01:18:55.533 --> 01:18:58.315]  The elites are... This is all just getting too weird, Steve.
[01:18:58.962 --> 01:19:10.571]  Well, can I tell you this, Alex, and I know that there are certain things that, you know, we're trying to cover, but the esoteric nature of it is the very spirit behind everything you've written about, Alex, everything you've broadcast about.
[01:19:10.992 --> 01:19:21.100]  Though people see the literal nuts and bolts of how it's being implemented, when these individuals are meeting at the pyramids, when they're meeting at the sacrificial centers of the world,
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:36.195]  Now that you've got the earthquakes happening, and don't forget one of the biggest volcanoes in the world is Popo, in the vicinity of Mexico City, I think the thing that people really have got to get through their head now is that they have to take an active role.
[01:19:36.235 --> 01:19:42.321]  You and I have taught them how to fish, but we can't put the fish and reel in their hand and point them to the waterhole of knowledge.
[01:19:42.581 --> 01:19:43.582]  They've got to act.
[01:19:43.622 --> 01:19:44.603]  They have got to prepare.
[01:19:44.623 --> 01:19:45.164]  And Alex,
[01:19:45.544 --> 01:19:49.166]  This esoteric nature of it is the spirit behind all of it.
[01:19:49.926 --> 01:20:07.675]  Listen, just as that represents Mexico City, represents the blood-sacrificed capital of the world, the Luciferians were sending a signal that out of the blood-sacrificed capital city of the world would go the ultimate Luciferian sacrifice of, I don't know how many dead, but trust me, 50 millions on the white side.
[01:20:07.975 --> 01:20:09.316]  Stay there, stay there, stay there!
[01:20:10.336 --> 01:20:12.679]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[01:20:12.819 --> 01:20:16.524]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[01:20:16.624 --> 01:20:19.268]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[01:20:19.428 --> 01:20:26.638]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[01:20:26.758 --> 01:20:27.478]  We're good to go!
[01:20:49.907 --> 01:20:54.330]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:22.214]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:22.734 --> 01:21:28.939]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:29.159 --> 01:21:31.060]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:33.602]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:21:33.682 --> 01:21:44.570]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:21:46.855 --> 01:21:48.116]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:48.516 --> 01:21:49.916]  It's about a one world government.
[01:21:50.376 --> 01:21:56.719]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:21:57.279 --> 01:22:05.062]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:05.542 --> 01:22:06.702]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:07.122 --> 01:22:08.303]  The people strike back.
[01:22:10.339 --> 01:22:14.003]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:22:14.424 --> 01:22:19.849]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:21.391]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:22:21.411 --> 01:22:25.456]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:22:26.116 --> 01:22:39.423]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:22:39.923 --> 01:22:45.226]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:22:45.526 --> 01:22:51.409]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:22:52.169 --> 01:22:53.430]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:55.131]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:22:55.151 --> 01:22:55.572]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:55.592 --> 01:22:57.593]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:22:57.613 --> 01:22:57.673]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:09.815 --> 01:23:12.757]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:23:12.917 --> 01:23:18.141]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:23:18.441 --> 01:23:23.785]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:23:24.165 --> 01:23:25.266]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:23:25.626 --> 01:23:34.513]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[01:23:34.933 --> 01:23:36.575]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:23:36.775 --> 01:23:40.959]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[01:23:40.999 --> 01:23:45.623]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[01:23:50.928 --> 01:23:59.092]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[01:23:59.333 --> 01:24:03.495]  Try Calvin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[01:24:03.515 --> 01:24:04.556]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:24:21.405 --> 01:24:29.510]  Steve Quayle, I want to open the phones up for quick questions from Nathan, Leo, Bill, Dominic, JD, Nicolette, Sherry, Dave, Carter, George, Nathan, Morty.
[01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:31.751]  We're going to take a lot of calls in the next segment.
[01:24:31.992 --> 01:24:33.953]  Just quick questions or comments from all of them.
[01:24:35.254 --> 01:24:36.334]  And then get your take on it.
[01:24:37.975 --> 01:24:41.818]  We'll also put up on screen your website for folks as well.
[01:24:44.099 --> 01:24:45.300]  But Steve, look.
[01:24:46.636 --> 01:24:52.523]  We know they use this type of hype to train everybody to take the vaccines, to take the Tanaflu, to take the drugs.
[01:24:52.984 --> 01:24:54.926]  The government's your friend, it gives you a little mask.
[01:24:55.286 --> 01:25:00.633]  But they leave our borders wide open while Europe is screening Americans and Mexicans that fly in.
[01:25:00.653 --> 01:25:05.359]  They're banning our food imports to Germany and Russia and England and others.
[01:25:06.937 --> 01:25:10.561]  I mean, if there's not something to this, it's a crime that they're hyping it up.
[01:25:11.502 --> 01:25:14.525]  And then we've got all the news of cover-ups of how many have really died.
[01:25:14.545 --> 01:25:18.989]  And then you look at this clearly engineered virus.
[01:25:19.009 --> 01:25:20.571]  The doctors we've had on have said clearly.
[01:25:20.591 --> 01:25:24.936]  I mean, they usually talk about, you know, bird flu mixing with human.
[01:25:26.897 --> 01:25:28.358]  Some of the variants having evidence of this.
[01:25:28.378 --> 01:25:41.627]  And then they say that the maker of the vaccine that the UN has chosen is Baxter, the company we've been railing against, who told 18 sub-companies in Europe to mix live bird flu with regular vaccine.
[01:25:41.667 --> 01:25:42.768]  Thank God they got caught.
[01:25:43.048 --> 01:25:46.110]  But then some unnamed companies in mainstream news want to telegraph.
[01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:51.491]  That was paying city workers to give homeless shots and paying them, and the homeless were dying of bird flu.
[01:25:51.511 --> 01:25:53.952]  In fact, put that up on screen about the homeless dying of bird flu.
[01:25:53.972 --> 01:25:56.412]  I want people to see these mainstream articles who don't believe us.
[01:25:56.953 --> 01:25:59.033]  I mean, something stinks here, Steve.
[01:25:59.273 --> 01:26:01.414]  I mean, I'm seeing a lot of crazy stuff.
[01:26:01.694 --> 01:26:06.455]  I don't know what's coming out of this, but definitely this has got New World Order fingerprints all over it.
[01:26:07.065 --> 01:26:07.905]  Well, absolutely.
[01:26:07.945 --> 01:26:12.047]  And for those of you, the people that are biblically inclined, this is the pestilence.
[01:26:12.067 --> 01:26:14.809]  This is one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.
[01:26:14.829 --> 01:26:16.469]  And I think that people need to understand this.
[01:26:16.529 --> 01:26:17.470]  We're being isolated.
[01:26:17.550 --> 01:26:24.153]  Alex, I said five years ago, the time will come when no trains will run, no planes will fly, no cars, no vehicles, etc.
[01:26:24.213 --> 01:26:26.714]  America will become completely isolated.
[01:26:27.174 --> 01:26:32.576]  It will be isolated in that we will be cut off, we will be considered the pariah nation of the world.
[01:26:32.616 --> 01:26:37.678]  Now let's get back to Mexico really quick because I think this is what's going to take down the economy, okay?
[01:26:37.978 --> 01:26:40.079]  Our economy, not just Mexico's economy.
[01:26:40.539 --> 01:26:44.181]  My sources on the ground in that area are claiming 2,000 dead.
[01:26:44.201 --> 01:26:44.301]  2,000 dead.
[01:26:47.461 --> 01:26:50.365]  Now, first of all, I believe nothing that comes out of officialdom.
[01:26:50.846 --> 01:26:58.075]  I believe that the CDC is only there to control and, how should I say this, disseminate the information.
[01:26:58.536 --> 01:27:02.481]  I believe that this is, if you will, imagine America as the test tube.
[01:27:02.521 --> 01:27:03.523]  This is the test case.
[01:27:04.023 --> 01:27:14.525]  And so, over the years, when you and I would talk about the depopulation of the world, 90%, we got, you know, all the tinfoil hat boys to get together on boards and hoist a few scotches to us.
[01:27:14.925 --> 01:27:31.808]  But now, this is something that even strikes the boldest skeptic, because the smallest virus, the smallest bug, the question is, are they testing first on a select, confined population, i.e., Mexicans, Hispanics, Latinos,
[01:27:32.488 --> 01:27:41.652]  Or is this just the fear to make everyone run to the answer, the Hegelian dialectic, by injection and take the vaccination?
[01:27:41.772 --> 01:27:45.394]  I am convinced the vaccination is the execution dose.
[01:27:45.734 --> 01:27:49.916]  If you deny or decline to take the vaccination, that's when the camps come in.
[01:27:49.956 --> 01:27:51.496]  That's when the martial law comes in, Alex.
[01:27:51.837 --> 01:27:52.437]  Oh my God!
[01:27:52.757 --> 01:27:53.858]  Why didn't I see this?
[01:27:54.778 --> 01:28:11.385]  Of course, Baxter's caught breeding up millions of dosages of vaccine with live bird flu that the scientists in the Czech Republic said would be a perfect way to create a master airborne mutagen with a 90% kill rate with that particular version of bird flu when you can ingest it.
[01:28:11.665 --> 01:28:13.166]  If you actually get it, you're in deep trouble.
[01:28:13.746 --> 01:28:26.992]  And then they're making all these vaccines, the news won't say where all the vaccine stock went, and then Baxter is chosen out of hundreds of major companies to be the one to make the vaccine for this flu.
[01:28:27.812 --> 01:28:29.373]  Oh my, oh man.
[01:28:29.693 --> 01:28:31.854]  This is so insipidly wicked.
[01:28:32.234 --> 01:28:33.794]  This is so horrific.
[01:28:34.255 --> 01:28:42.158]  I honestly believe, Alex, and I make no bones about this, by the way, my guesstimate on time based on what I'm sensing in my gut
[01:28:42.862 --> 01:28:46.704]  It's from about Thursday on, things are going to turn totally bad.
[01:28:46.724 --> 01:28:49.346]  You know, I caught nothing but crap for putting up the Orange Alert.
[01:28:49.786 --> 01:28:53.048]  People were saying, oh, you shouldn't do this, you shouldn't do that, and I stand by that alert.
[01:28:53.388 --> 01:28:56.870]  I did not put up that alert without a lot of intercessors praying.
[01:28:57.250 --> 01:28:58.150]  I sought the Lord.
[01:28:58.230 --> 01:29:02.753]  I said, God, I cannot afford to be wrong on this one, not for my sake, but for your people's sake.
[01:29:02.793 --> 01:29:03.653]  Now, here's the deal.
[01:29:04.094 --> 01:29:06.415]  The situation that's going on right now is
[01:29:07.115 --> 01:29:08.196]  Absolutely.
[01:29:08.697 --> 01:29:18.106]  So diabolically wicked that the simple Western mind of well-meaning Americans cannot even embrace the thought of what you just had as a revelation.
[01:29:19.428 --> 01:29:20.349]  They cannot embrace it.
[01:29:21.024 --> 01:29:36.318]  Therefore, because they reject the knowledge, or, you know, the mainstream will call you and I the tinfoil boys or whatever, you know, the bottom line in all this, and I keep saying that, Alex, cutting to the chase, this is the initiating action.
[01:29:36.338 --> 01:29:39.020]  What comes from this point is the death.
[01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:41.382]  Well, take 76.
[01:29:41.923 --> 01:29:45.146]  The swine flu wasn't killing anybody.
[01:29:46.141 --> 01:29:47.862]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:30:14.096 --> 01:30:16.239]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:23.770]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:30:24.295 --> 01:30:30.481]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:30:30.502 --> 01:30:32.724]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:30:32.864 --> 01:30:35.286]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:30:35.367 --> 01:30:46.318]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:30:46.943 --> 01:30:48.225]  It's not about left or right.
[01:30:48.605 --> 01:30:49.986]  It's about a one world government.
[01:30:50.467 --> 01:30:56.834]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:31:05.643 --> 01:31:06.804]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:07.224 --> 01:31:08.406]  The people strike back.
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:14.101]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:31:14.241 --> 01:31:19.443]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:31:19.623 --> 01:31:24.405]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:31:24.785 --> 01:31:35.909]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:31:36.309 --> 01:31:41.855]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:31:42.075 --> 01:31:48.161]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:31:48.341 --> 01:31:49.001]  What about you?
[01:31:49.382 --> 01:31:55.428]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:32:27.612 --> 01:32:27.992]  Israeli gas masks $20.
[01:32:35.094 --> 01:32:38.478]  Trigger finger gloves, five dollars a pair or thirty six dollars a dozen.
[01:32:38.738 --> 01:32:41.862]  Snowshoe binding for eight dollars or forty eight dollars a dozen.
[01:32:42.062 --> 01:32:43.083]  And so much more.
[01:32:43.363 --> 01:32:46.787]  Even hard to find surplus items, all at surplus prices.
[01:32:47.088 --> 01:32:49.891]  Preparing the whole family has never been so affordable.
[01:32:50.031 --> 01:32:50.631]  We're good to go.
[01:33:16.067 --> 01:33:28.091]  Alright, your calls are coming up with our guest, Steve Quayle, at the end of the hour, end of the show, and then it starts back over with Dr. Tim Penny from Mexico and Dr. Deagle popping in, Paul Watson from England.
[01:33:29.532 --> 01:33:30.732]  You know, I just want to be clear here.
[01:33:31.672 --> 01:33:35.514]  State Department ran them 200, saying they've got to sterilize and reduce the population by half.
[01:33:36.374 --> 01:33:40.836]  Biological diversity assessment by the U.N., 1996, and others saying they want to get rid of 80% of us.
[01:33:42.284 --> 01:33:46.285]  The official statements, Dr. Eric Pianca, I just use him because it made national news.
[01:33:46.325 --> 01:33:47.825]  Most people heard about him.
[01:33:47.885 --> 01:33:48.925]  It was big news for a few weeks.
[01:33:48.945 --> 01:33:52.686]  He said he wants 90% of us to die with an airborne Ebola.
[01:33:53.926 --> 01:33:56.647]  And that he can't wait for everybody to die and he wants it to be basically engineered.
[01:33:56.667 --> 01:33:57.867]  The FBI even went and visited him.
[01:33:57.987 --> 01:33:58.847]  We called for that.
[01:34:00.628 --> 01:34:06.729]  When you go to Pianca's site at UT, I haven't checked this in about a year, Google Dr. Eric Pianca, UT.
[01:34:08.567 --> 01:34:12.649]  And it'll be EDU, it'll be University of Texas site.
[01:34:12.990 --> 01:34:17.072]  It's him in druid robes saying he's a druid and that he loves Lucifer.
[01:34:17.292 --> 01:34:19.073]  This is on University of Texas site.
[01:34:19.113 --> 01:34:23.956]  Now, this guy who is a druid, goes to class as a druid, big beard, biologist.
[01:34:24.716 --> 01:34:29.581]  He has all these graduate students that sent us threatening emails and people that, oh, I went to him ten years ago, he's great.
[01:34:30.001 --> 01:34:35.547]  It's them in white lab coats as doctors and biologists in BioShield bioweapons programs.
[01:34:35.567 --> 01:34:40.271]  You know, the BioShield program you hear is to fight bioweapons, but they admit it's really a bioweapons program.
[01:34:40.732 --> 01:34:43.775]  But the key here is this guy got up and got a standing ovation.
[01:34:44.475 --> 01:34:44.915]  At St.
[01:34:44.995 --> 01:34:45.955]  Edwards here in Austin.
[01:34:45.975 --> 01:34:50.116]  It was in the paper and it was also Texas Academy of Sciences when he was meeting in South Texas.
[01:34:50.657 --> 01:34:53.637]  All over the world he gets standing ovations when he says kill 90% of us.
[01:34:54.037 --> 01:34:59.219]  And his graduate students sent me papers saying, look, Jones, he is a conservative.
[01:34:59.379 --> 01:35:00.959]  I believe the humans are a parasite.
[01:35:01.319 --> 01:35:03.280]  We did reports on this at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:04.880]  All humans should be killed.
[01:35:06.471 --> 01:35:13.914]  So, this is what Prince Philip, Ted Turner, the UN, the Kissingers, so when Steve gets into all of this, they admit they're Luciferians.
[01:35:13.954 --> 01:35:28.159]  We, even if you're an atheist, the point is, cold-bloodedly, just from an anthropological, you know, view, or studying the elites, you know, if you're studying, you know, I mean, if you wrote a book, The Elites of the World in the Year 2009, you know, published 2020 or whatever, let's, you know, imaginary book,
[01:35:31.864 --> 01:35:37.488]  And you were just an anthropologist, sociologist, looking at what the elites really believed?
[01:35:38.008 --> 01:35:41.111]  They're a bunch of bloodthirsty killers that want to kill everybody for Gaia.
[01:35:42.412 --> 01:35:44.673]  Earth First Battalion and the Pentagon, all of this.
[01:35:46.034 --> 01:35:51.378]  And so when Steve talks about all this from his Christian perspective, and I'm a Christian as well, not a mainline fake Christian,
[01:35:53.143 --> 01:36:04.910]  Regardless, the real data shows that, and so we have to look at this when they're saying swine flu virus may cause global pandemic, United Nations, French News Agency, and U.S.
[01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:06.071]  emergency declared.
[01:36:06.091 --> 01:36:08.813]  In fact, I didn't even get to this.
[01:36:08.873 --> 01:36:11.674]  It's in my stack of mainstream news, where the U.S.
[01:36:11.734 --> 01:36:15.477]  government is saying, stay indoors in these areas in Texas.
[01:36:16.597 --> 01:36:19.219]  Uh, Napolitano says the really bad stuff's to come.
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:22.322]  America's told to wear masks as swine flu spreads around the globe.
[01:36:22.342 --> 01:36:25.365]  Remember the media told you that you didn't need masks?
[01:36:25.685 --> 01:36:27.006]  It was safe at Ground Zero?
[01:36:27.506 --> 01:36:28.707]  We got on there and said you needed them?
[01:36:29.048 --> 01:36:30.949]  Well, the point is you need a nano mask.
[01:36:30.969 --> 01:36:37.054]  Just a regular mask may reduce a piece of spit in the air, somebody sneezes, you know, some mucus that's got the virus in it.
[01:36:37.334 --> 01:36:39.516]  So it does help reduce, but it doesn't completely protect you.
[01:36:39.536 --> 01:36:40.797]  You need to get a nano mask.
[01:36:41.718 --> 01:36:45.040]  I worry about folks like my dad who's a dentist doing bloody procedures every day.
[01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:47.481]  But again, it's all hype right now.
[01:36:47.581 --> 01:36:48.381]  Why all the fear?
[01:36:48.421 --> 01:36:50.882]  Why the gearing up when other flus go far more than this?
[01:36:50.902 --> 01:36:52.583]  Well, it's unseasonable.
[01:36:52.643 --> 01:36:53.783]  Didn't come from the East.
[01:36:54.284 --> 01:36:56.424]  Is a weird transgenetic mixture.
[01:36:57.805 --> 01:36:59.126]  Telltale designer.
[01:36:59.446 --> 01:37:00.546]  Came out of Mexico.
[01:37:00.626 --> 01:37:01.587]  Not in the flu season.
[01:37:02.827 --> 01:37:07.971]  Just all of this is going on, and other countries are acting scared to death of this.
[01:37:08.131 --> 01:37:11.714]  Something's going on, and I hope they pull back from whatever they're planning.
[01:37:12.434 --> 01:37:16.257]  But, you know, we've given you in the first few hours the view that it's a hoax, the view that they're hyping it.
[01:37:16.637 --> 01:37:18.138]  But remember who's doing it.
[01:37:18.478 --> 01:37:19.899]  They've proven they're capable of anything.
[01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:20.360]  Steve Coyle.
[01:37:21.391 --> 01:37:26.093]  First of all, people are emailing me asking me do I think this is just a distraction.
[01:37:26.113 --> 01:37:40.561]  I would say this is part of the entire plan because Alex and everyone I've interviewed over 25 years in the world of spooks, kooks and everything else that comes along the way and spies, counter spies, intelligence, military, etc.
[01:37:41.321 --> 01:37:56.010]  The central theme you've got is that these entities, okay, that worship Lucifer and hate Jesus, by the way, the idea is that they are going to distract with as many issues as they can to simply overwhelm us.
[01:37:56.070 --> 01:38:02.875]  Because, look, if it isn't the money system that everybody's worrying about, gee, how am I going to retire, blah, blah, blah, now they've got to worry about this, worry about that.
[01:38:03.215 --> 01:38:06.977]  This is all part of the plan to simply overwhelm.
[01:38:07.217 --> 01:38:09.379]  This is the shock and awfulness
[01:38:09.859 --> 01:38:10.320]  I think so.
[01:38:32.961 --> 01:38:34.742]  You better be building your immune system.
[01:38:35.142 --> 01:38:38.845]  You better have nanoparticle mass, not just the N95.
[01:38:39.405 --> 01:38:40.306]  It's interesting, Alex.
[01:38:40.326 --> 01:38:44.209]  We're talking about some of the most virulent, deadly things ever conceived.
[01:38:44.249 --> 01:38:47.671]  And by the way, how do you tell this is Lucifer, and that it's not a natural thing?
[01:38:48.132 --> 01:38:56.117]  Every single thing that God created in the book of Genesis, He created after its likeness and kind and thought it was good.
[01:38:56.458 --> 01:38:59.740]  The thing that the devil wants to do more than anything is destroy.
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:13.671]  Every parameter, every boundary, every act of beautiful, wonderful, godly creation, and substitute the Luciferian death-destroying force into that whole equation.
[01:39:13.731 --> 01:39:15.433]  So, what does that mean to us right now?
[01:39:15.793 --> 01:39:26.842]  It means that if Doug McIntosh, the guy who sent me the email, who in my opinion was so far ahead of his time in writing that, you know, people poo-pooed him on the economy, but the deal is, look, if it is a race-specific
[01:39:27.342 --> 01:39:28.343]  Biologically engineered.
[01:39:28.423 --> 01:39:41.290]  And Alex, when Woutard-Basson, ladies and gentlemen, go Google it on my website, SteveQuayle.com, when he was arrested, the most powerful, richest people in the world demanded his release.
[01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:42.010]  Guess what, Alex?
[01:39:42.270 --> 01:39:43.111]  He wrote the book.
[01:39:43.191 --> 01:39:50.395]  He was the one that was the breakthrough scientist on race-specific targeted genetic weapons.
[01:39:50.815 --> 01:39:55.978]  Now, if that doesn't scare the hell out of everybody, maybe, brother, you and I need to just, you know, hold our breath or something.
[01:39:56.983 --> 01:40:15.748]  And if it doesn't provoke them to take action, nothing, here, nothing the DHS says, Department of Human Sacrifice, nothing the official mouthpieces say, look, even to a certain degree, those people at that level don't understand the higher levels of esoteric murder, okay?
[01:40:16.148 --> 01:40:20.990]  Or ritual, satanic deliverance of the innocence to death.
[01:40:21.490 --> 01:40:25.611]  And I can't fault them on that, obviously they don't see it, but what they don't understand
[01:40:26.011 --> 01:40:32.493]  Is once they're done implementing, they're taking down of, quote, the Red List, they get whacked within 30 to 45 days.
[01:40:32.533 --> 01:40:34.133]  You brought the United Nations, okay?
[01:40:34.473 --> 01:40:38.634]  And that professor, I remember doing a show with you when you brought him up before.
[01:40:39.115 --> 01:40:41.995]  What people don't understand, the United Nations has a process.
[01:40:42.015 --> 01:40:42.976]  You ready for this, Alex?
[01:40:43.416 --> 01:40:48.617]  The name of taking down the Earth's population is called Curative Process.
[01:40:49.317 --> 01:40:51.178]  C-U-R-A-I-T-V-E.
[01:40:51.238 --> 01:40:52.138]  Interesting word, is it?
[01:40:55.228 --> 01:40:55.769]  Steve, go ahead.
[01:40:55.789 --> 01:40:56.871]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:40:57.091 --> 01:41:03.981]  I just wanted to give you, so based on the, based on where we're at right now, this is not just a little flash in the pan.
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:09.142]  This is not the normal vectoring of a pathogenic release.
[01:41:09.202 --> 01:41:13.124]  This is simultaneous releases in different parts of the world.
[01:41:13.204 --> 01:41:17.445]  And normally they would have been following it as it was in Asia moving to Europe.
[01:41:17.485 --> 01:41:19.186]  Here it just pops up in Mexico.
[01:41:19.486 --> 01:41:20.707]  Flues don't do that.
[01:41:21.187 --> 01:41:24.448]  This thing is clearly manufactured.
[01:41:24.729 --> 01:41:26.589]  The question is, is it a false alarm?
[01:41:26.889 --> 01:41:28.610]  Or is it what Dr. Deagle was saying earlier?
[01:41:28.630 --> 01:41:32.732]  It seems you're saying it's a carrier to turn into something worse.
[01:41:33.266 --> 01:41:50.904]  I'm agreeing with Dr. Deagle, but I'm saying that, and I absolutely agree with him, and the thing is, is that, to my knowledge, when he and I have talked off the record and off the mic, he was intimately and intricately involved in a lot of the machinations of viral weapon development.
[01:41:51.044 --> 01:41:55.829]  Saying all that, Alex, the thing that people need to know is what they can do, and I'll tell you this.
[01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:58.530]  They had better consider the basics.
[01:41:58.570 --> 01:42:02.613]  They should really be looking at the fact of looking where the clusters come.
[01:42:02.653 --> 01:42:03.633]  Here's how I think it'll be.
[01:42:03.913 --> 01:42:09.416]  It'll be, it'll take place, the Marshall Implementation will ultimately start in stages, okay?
[01:42:09.697 --> 01:42:15.600]  Whether it's Texas border towns, or it's the entire border, but as you've said, this border, isn't it strange?
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:22.804]  We've got the most dangerous, pathogenic emergency, health emergency declared by Janet Napolitano,
[01:42:23.231 --> 01:42:23.591]  I don't know.
[01:42:41.966 --> 01:42:47.128]  This next coming 5 days to 14 days is going to be absolutely critical.
[01:42:47.568 --> 01:42:52.270]  If Mexico... Yeah, well that's when they always are launching all sorts of bizarre occult activities.
[01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:56.291]  Launching the revolution of the Soviets and others is on May Day.
[01:42:56.311 --> 01:42:57.092]  It's an occult day.
[01:42:57.452 --> 01:43:00.253]  By the way, look at Dr. Eric Pianca's UT page.
[01:43:00.613 --> 01:43:03.254]  It's all about DNA sequencing and how he wants to get rid of people.
[01:43:03.634 --> 01:43:05.255]  And then you go to his obituary.
[01:43:05.275 --> 01:43:06.235]  He has a link on there.
[01:43:06.575 --> 01:43:08.596]  Official University of Texas Biology Department.
[01:43:09.036 --> 01:43:10.357]  And he says, I'm not dead yet.
[01:43:10.377 --> 01:43:14.140]  And then he calls himself the Lizard Man and the Snake Man.
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:19.243]  And then you scroll down, he's in here talking about Lucifer.
[01:43:20.044 --> 01:43:22.165]  And then he names his animals Lucifer.
[01:43:22.185 --> 01:43:25.448]  And then he's dressed up like a druid in here.
[01:43:25.468 --> 01:43:30.011]  I mean, this guy, this is who wants 90% of us at least to die.
[01:43:30.031 --> 01:43:32.312]  And he's got his ranch out there.
[01:43:33.033 --> 01:43:37.997]  And it says, I mean, just absolutely amazing.
[01:43:39.177 --> 01:43:42.038]  It used to have him dressed up like a druid on here.
[01:43:42.078 --> 01:43:44.039]  We did find another page that has the picture of him.
[01:43:44.059 --> 01:43:46.620]  I mean, that was on his UT site.
[01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:47.800]  It may be on a sub-page.
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:48.581]  I hate to interrupt.
[01:43:48.961 --> 01:43:56.103]  Well, you know, regardless, they're going to use all this fear they're hyping, Steve, to get more control over society.
[01:43:56.864 --> 01:44:01.225]  We know that they are, you know, doing that and training us that they're the saviors.
[01:44:02.186 --> 01:44:08.128]  Hey, Alex, one of the things people need to recognize, why is it that Independent slash supposedly Independent Network
[01:44:08.684 --> 01:44:12.666]  Always use the same neuro-linguistic programming term.
[01:44:13.046 --> 01:44:14.806]  You turn on CBS, it's the same term.
[01:44:14.826 --> 01:44:20.148]  You turn on ABC or whatever, you know, MSNBC, whatever you're looking at, Bloomberg, etc.
[01:44:20.528 --> 01:44:22.289]  It's almost like the scriptwriters.
[01:44:22.309 --> 01:44:26.290]  Now listen, I have talked to psychological operations officers at Northcom.
[01:44:26.771 --> 01:44:29.372]  Quote, unquote, there is nothing that hits the media.
[01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.569]  I don't know.
[01:44:46.435 --> 01:44:47.256]  Steve, we're losing you.
[01:44:47.296 --> 01:44:48.818]  Your phone volume's going up and down.
[01:44:48.838 --> 01:44:49.819]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:50.560]  Is this better?
[01:44:50.921 --> 01:44:51.161]  Yeah.
[01:44:51.802 --> 01:44:53.043]  Yep.
[01:44:53.123 --> 01:44:58.450]  The situation that the news media always uses the same words, okay?
[01:44:58.470 --> 01:45:00.773]  The neuro-linguistic program repeated, repeated, repeated.
[01:45:00.813 --> 01:45:01.814]  No, it's all scripted.
[01:45:01.874 --> 01:45:03.156]  It's all scripted globally.
[01:45:03.396 --> 01:45:04.037]  Exactly.
[01:45:04.617 --> 01:45:05.117]  Absolutely.
[01:45:05.197 --> 01:45:20.866]  So what I'm saying is the idea is that this is a, as everyone, this is just the carrier wave of the next wave to come, and the next wave to come is going to be very, very deadly and very, very dangerous, but that does not mean that this thing is meant to dismiss.
[01:45:20.886 --> 01:45:25.328]  Listen, these guys test, test, test, and retest, okay?
[01:45:25.999 --> 01:45:37.504]  By selectively introducing a genetically altered virus and testing it on a specific subject group, they can tell if there's a natural resistance that they didn't anticipate.
[01:45:37.524 --> 01:45:40.005]  You see, Alex, 80% death isn't enough.
[01:45:40.702 --> 01:45:42.083]  90% certainly isn't good enough.
[01:45:42.323 --> 01:45:46.345]  They want a 100% lethal dose or lethal kill ratio.
[01:45:46.365 --> 01:45:50.168]  So this is wargaming, the response, the propaganda, all of it.
[01:45:50.248 --> 01:45:50.588]  I agree.
[01:45:50.628 --> 01:45:51.428]  That's how they operate.
[01:45:51.448 --> 01:46:03.475]  And then you have, look, the final piece is Baxter, the company involved with Bayer, knowingly shipping out HIV and hepatitis to over a million people in the Factor VIII vaccines.
[01:46:03.815 --> 01:46:04.736]  That is on record.
[01:46:04.816 --> 01:46:05.676]  That is on record.
[01:46:05.696 --> 01:46:06.717]  You know, mainstream news.
[01:46:06.757 --> 01:46:08.318]  Just Google Factor VIII, folks.
[01:46:08.358 --> 01:46:08.978]  It'll blow you away.
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:11.280]  Knowingly!
[01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:13.403]  And they just say, oh we know them, we did it, and they're still in business.
[01:46:14.063 --> 01:46:21.612]  Now they get caught mixing live bird flu with the vaccine stocks in Europe, and now the UN chooses them to make the vaccine for that.
[01:46:21.912 --> 01:46:26.418]  I mean, how would you trust these people to clean toilets, much less be making the vaccine?
[01:46:26.972 --> 01:46:38.323]  I wouldn't, but remember this, Janet Napolitano declared a health emergency, and remember Alex, when you and I were beating the drum on them, what was it, the Medical Emergency Health Powers Act or something?
[01:46:38.523 --> 01:46:38.924]  MEPA?
[01:46:39.324 --> 01:46:39.985]  M-E-H-P-A?
[01:46:41.101 --> 01:46:43.063]  I think everybody better go Google that.
[01:46:43.484 --> 01:46:55.396]  And the thing is, I may have a couple of the initials backwards or something, but basically it gives, under a health emergency, this is the prima facie cause for the Declaration of Martial Law.
[01:46:55.676 --> 01:46:58.219]  You don't take the vaccine, you go into the camps.
[01:46:59.170 --> 01:47:01.792]  I'm telling you... No, no, no, Steve, you're right.
[01:47:02.072 --> 01:47:08.157]  They have always drilled and trained, on record, that they're going to lock down, do forced inoculations.
[01:47:08.177 --> 01:47:09.718]  They've trained the clergy response teams.
[01:47:09.758 --> 01:47:14.842]  The first thing is, tell the people what's of the Lord to take the shots, go to the camps to turn their guns in.
[01:47:15.163 --> 01:47:24.049]  They have drilled the whole martial law architecture, not around fighting Al-Qaeda, but around confiscating guns during a breakdown of society, during forced inoculations.
[01:47:24.089 --> 01:47:27.092]  You're absolutely right, and I just hope this isn't the big one.
[01:47:27.659 --> 01:47:43.170]  Well, I believe it's a big one, and you said in a powerful statement, these doctors, especially the gentleman you're quoting in the University of Texas, remember this, a doctor is trained with one twist of the scalpel one way to cure, with a twist of the scalpel the other way, it kills.
[01:47:43.730 --> 01:47:45.230]  And he or they killed.
[01:47:45.550 --> 01:47:50.591]  Look at the greatest mass murders in history, Alex, and besides, of course, the Aztecs and others.
[01:47:50.931 --> 01:47:52.652]  But the thing is, is that they're doctors.
[01:47:52.792 --> 01:47:54.132]  Obviously, Dr. Mengele.
[01:47:54.472 --> 01:47:57.073]  Obviously, Dr. Ishii of World War II fame.
[01:47:57.413 --> 01:47:58.413]  And it's fascinating.
[01:47:58.433 --> 01:48:00.413]  We even take the higher-ups of Al-Qaeda.
[01:48:00.693 --> 01:48:01.574]  They're doctors.
[01:48:01.594 --> 01:48:02.934]  They're medical doctors.
[01:48:02.994 --> 01:48:08.975]  The point that I'm trying to make here is this, is that you have a group of sinister
[01:48:09.748 --> 01:48:23.102]  Sold out to Satan individuals that control the world's financial structure that now have been given the go-ahead to launch the destruction of the planetary population through all and every means feasible.
[01:48:23.122 --> 01:48:24.984]  Well, they're Luciferian witch doctors.
[01:48:25.064 --> 01:48:27.427]  It goes back to their original calling, the twin snakes.
[01:48:28.047 --> 01:48:28.888]  Absolutely.
[01:48:29.148 --> 01:48:36.811]  And the point that people have to recognize is that if you don't act now, you'll be forced to react later.
[01:48:36.931 --> 01:48:40.453]  And I'm getting emails because I put out the red alert, or excuse me, orange alert.
[01:48:40.813 --> 01:48:42.314]  And by the way, can I make something clear?
[01:48:42.674 --> 01:48:48.557]  When I put out the red alert, and I don't know if you've heard about this, some people, I didn't call it that, but it'd be called the red screen of death.
[01:48:49.017 --> 01:48:51.839]  That means that you've got two weeks before the hammer falls.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:53.761]  Don't dismiss my orange alert.
[01:48:53.841 --> 01:48:54.361]  It was right.
[01:48:54.441 --> 01:48:58.804]  I'm telling you, this weekend's going to get very, very problematic.
[01:48:58.905 --> 01:49:07.791]  And from that point forward, I can't say at what time, because I know the July date for the exercise of bringing in all the NATO troops.
[01:49:07.871 --> 01:49:12.755]  And Alex, no one will come clean with how many NATO troops are being brought into the country.
[01:49:12.875 --> 01:49:15.257]  Oh my gosh, I forgot they're having a huge NATO drill.
[01:49:16.598 --> 01:49:23.244]  In Mexico and Arizona, they're having FEMA drills all over the country set for next month.
[01:49:23.384 --> 01:49:25.767]  Four pathogenic releases.
[01:49:25.827 --> 01:49:28.849]  I covered that last week when you were on in other shows.
[01:49:29.370 --> 01:49:33.194]  I'm starting to put all... This is a very bizarre coincidence if it's not on purpose.
[01:49:33.214 --> 01:49:36.216]  There are no coincidences, Alex.
[01:49:36.837 --> 01:49:37.978]  Not in this world.
[01:49:38.238 --> 01:49:40.941]  Not in the world that you and I discuss, there are no coincidences.
[01:49:41.121 --> 01:49:43.583]  Well, certainly not in the world of politics, like Roosevelt said.
[01:49:43.623 --> 01:49:45.984]  If something happens, you can know it was planned that way in politics.
[01:49:46.585 --> 01:49:53.990]  And you put all of this together, it certainly is a very, very interesting time to be alive.
[01:49:54.210 --> 01:49:55.491]  Steve, I want to throw this out now.
[01:49:55.691 --> 01:50:00.034]  I have got a meeting I've got to go to in about 15 minutes after the show's over, but
[01:50:01.081 --> 01:50:03.184]  I promise to go to about 15 callers.
[01:50:03.544 --> 01:50:07.509]  If we give them each one minute when we come back, that would be 15 over into overdrive.
[01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:09.992]  Will you do a 15 minutes of overdrive with me?
[01:50:10.473 --> 01:50:13.136]  Sure, I'll do whatever you want because it's that important Alex.
[01:50:13.177 --> 01:50:15.540]  Look, our days are numbered.
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:16.461]  Let me share this with you.
[01:50:16.901 --> 01:50:21.603]  Ladies and gentlemen, the warnings are only in effect until the events take place.
[01:50:21.963 --> 01:50:24.804]  When the events are taking place, the warnings cease.
[01:50:24.844 --> 01:50:26.065]  That's where I believe we are, Alex.
[01:50:26.405 --> 01:50:39.010]  We are now in the last bits of time that the mercy of the God of Heaven is granting this nation to actually pleading with this nation through you, me, others that are warning, warning, warning, but the point is the warnings are over.
[01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:40.950]  It's now implementation time.
[01:50:41.210 --> 01:50:42.751]  They don't get any more time.
[01:50:42.791 --> 01:50:43.931]  We are out of time.
[01:50:44.051 --> 01:50:45.232]  It's in effect now.
[01:50:45.802 --> 01:51:10.005]  Well, Steve, I never heard you really talk like this, and just last week you said an orange alert, you know, in the next month they're going to drop the hammer, and I've never seen you do something like that, and that's why I had you on today, and I'm going from memory, but it was either on your show last Thursday, you know, Thursday before last, or that Monday, eight days ago, that you did talk about flu being the issue, so we're going to come back, take calls, go into overdrive, stay with us.
[01:51:11.175 --> 01:51:12.015]  You are a rebel.
[01:51:12.336 --> 01:51:12.736]  Admit it.
[01:51:13.076 --> 01:51:15.857]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[01:51:16.037 --> 01:51:18.118]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[01:51:18.438 --> 01:51:22.120]  Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:24.041]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot.
[01:51:24.421 --> 01:51:26.442]  And you can count your real friends on one hand.
[01:51:26.782 --> 01:51:27.703]  Well join the club.
[01:51:27.883 --> 01:51:33.807]  Einstein failed math, quit school, and his rebel ideas led to some of the world's most amazing discoveries.
[01:51:34.087 --> 01:51:38.630]  Edison rebelled against the dark, failed over a thousand times, then invented the light bulb.
[01:51:38.730 --> 01:51:43.333]  George Washington rebelled against an entire country and led the creation of a new one.
[01:51:43.493 --> 01:51:46.575]  Now Alex Jones is working to save that very country.
[01:51:46.735 --> 01:51:48.116]  So go ahead, be a rebel.
[01:51:48.276 --> 01:51:49.457]  Put in a food supply from
[01:52:00.151 --> 01:52:04.034]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:16.688 --> 01:52:22.050]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:28.752]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:29.072 --> 01:52:30.873]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:31.033 --> 01:52:33.413]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:33.493 --> 01:52:44.377]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:46.687 --> 01:52:47.948]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:48.349 --> 01:52:49.750]  It's about a one world government.
[01:52:50.211 --> 01:52:56.558]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:53:05.387 --> 01:53:06.528]  The Obama Deception.
[01:53:06.948 --> 01:53:08.150]  The people strike back.
[01:53:11.954 --> 01:53:15.998]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.
[01:53:16.478 --> 01:53:19.421]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved.

[01:54:19.684 --> 01:54:23.187]  I want to let you know about a few final sponsors before we end the main transmission.
[01:54:23.207 --> 01:54:25.929]  And we'll go to internetonlyatprisonatlanta.tv.
[01:54:26.670 --> 01:54:32.194]  And for the tens of thousands of people listening on the free streams at infowars.com.
[01:54:32.835 --> 01:54:36.157]  We are number one on Shoutcast now, basically all the time.
[01:54:36.938 --> 01:54:40.461]  Radio, music, talk, number one, period.
[01:54:40.981 --> 01:54:42.883]  And all of our streams don't even register on there.
[01:54:42.903 --> 01:54:44.504]  We're trying to figure out how to make them all show up.
[01:54:45.005 --> 01:54:47.307]  But really exciting, and don't forget that we have
[01:54:49.076 --> 01:54:52.939]  Free podcasts go to the Alex Jones Radio Show link at the top of InfoWars.com.
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:59.645]  There at the top tab by the Home and News and Multimedia links, Prison Planet Forum links, Shop links.
[01:54:59.665 --> 01:55:05.369]  You can click on Alex Jones Radio Show and subscribe to the free daily podcast for the four hours it's served out at the end of the show.
[01:55:05.610 --> 01:55:09.353]  We'll go back to Steve at SteveQuell.com spelled Q-U-A-Y-L-E.
[01:55:10.013 --> 01:55:10.653]  I don't think so.
[01:55:28.683 --> 01:55:29.544]  Go back to your calls.
[01:55:29.604 --> 01:55:33.126]  One of them is Ecolablue, the best atmospheric water generator out there.
[01:55:33.506 --> 01:55:42.652]  Just a fabulous system with seven internal filters, a computer system, a great digital readout, 7.5 gallons a day, seven filters including reverse osmosis and carbon.
[01:55:43.113 --> 01:55:46.495]  Simple to use, no chemicals, pollutants or toxins, neutral pH.

[01:55:49.537 --> 01:55:50.638]  Ecolablue.com.
[01:55:50.718 --> 01:55:52.179]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[01:55:52.699 --> 01:55:54.460]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com or 800-691-6043.
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:54.521]  1-800-691.
[01:55:59.024 --> 01:55:59.204]  60-43.
[01:55:59.605 --> 01:56:05.854]  And last but not least, don't forget Max the Orange Home Gang Guerrilla on Infowars.com.
[01:56:05.874 --> 01:56:07.616]  There is a banner link to him.
[01:56:09.639 --> 01:56:09.759]  Yeah.
[01:56:29.217 --> 01:56:34.058]  You know, basic improvements on your home that are inexpensive that will boost the sale of your home massively.
[01:56:34.338 --> 01:56:35.618]  Homegame.com.
[01:56:36.018 --> 01:56:39.939]  Okay, let's take a few calls for Steve Quayle now from the Genesis Board.
[01:56:39.959 --> 01:56:44.320]  And then I want to give the folks, we probably won't get to Bill, Dominique, and JD.
[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:47.220]  Only those guys can call this number right now because others are on hold there.
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:49.901]  888-201-2244.
[01:56:49.921 --> 01:56:50.421]  888-201-2244.
[01:56:51.141 --> 01:56:55.281]  And we'll go to you guys when the show ends and goes to internet only.
[01:56:55.301 --> 01:56:56.442]  888-201-2244.
[01:56:56.502 --> 01:56:58.082]  And everybody else that's holding.
[01:56:58.382 --> 01:57:01.084]  But right now, Nathan in New York, you're on the air with Steve Quayle.
[01:57:01.104 --> 01:57:01.464]  Go ahead.
[01:57:03.746 --> 01:57:05.267]  Go ahead, Nathan, you're on the air.
[01:57:05.287 --> 01:57:07.269]  Okay, he's gone.
[01:57:07.289 --> 01:57:09.571]  Let's go to Leo in Missouri.
[01:57:09.611 --> 01:57:11.252]  Go ahead, or is it Montana?
[01:57:11.532 --> 01:57:12.353]  Leo, you're on the air.
[01:57:12.873 --> 01:57:13.354]  Hey, Alex.
[01:57:13.394 --> 01:57:14.154]  Hey, Steve.
[01:57:15.035 --> 01:57:16.616]  You guys stole a little bit of my thunder.
[01:57:17.317 --> 01:57:27.265]  I'm one of the guys that happens to think this may be real based on that 96 Air Force article that came out saying that 30 million people would be killed by the flu.
[01:57:27.827 --> 01:57:29.848]  And by the way, I dropped the ball on that.
[01:57:30.288 --> 01:57:31.829]  I meant to cover that at the start of the show.
[01:57:31.869 --> 01:57:32.749]  We go into overdrive.
[01:57:32.769 --> 01:57:34.430]  I'm going to cover that at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:34.450 --> 01:57:34.810]  Go ahead.
[01:57:35.290 --> 01:57:39.892]  Okay, and then the other reason I think it may be real is all these mass graves that are popping up.
[01:57:40.192 --> 01:57:41.433]  They're being dug for a reason.
[01:57:42.381 --> 01:57:45.443]  It's not just one of these things where... And by the way, that's not a rumor.
[01:57:45.603 --> 01:57:49.887]  I have the mainstream news articles and I have the executive orders right here.
[01:57:49.907 --> 01:57:54.410]  We're going to cover that too when we come back, where they are building mass graves.
[01:57:54.450 --> 01:57:57.572]  And they'll use a straw man grave that isn't real to discredit it.
[01:57:57.592 --> 01:57:58.073]  Steve Quayle.
[01:57:58.713 --> 01:57:59.454]  Well, absolutely.
[01:57:59.494 --> 01:58:00.974]  The caller is absolutely right.
[01:58:00.994 --> 01:58:03.856]  You know, Alex, how much more in our face does it have to be?
[01:58:03.896 --> 01:58:11.840]  And my answer to that is probably you have to be on your back with the last bits of life looking up at the dirt they're throwing in on you at the mass grave.
[01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:15.502]  This should really make most people infuriated.
[01:58:15.902 --> 01:58:25.926]  That while we're talking on TalkRadar today, on the 27th of April, the thing is that these people are planning the extinction and annihilation of a minimum of 30 million people.
[01:58:25.966 --> 01:58:28.247]  By the way, I don't want to make any misconceptions.
[01:58:28.427 --> 01:58:29.607]  I believe this is it.
[01:58:29.787 --> 01:58:32.928]  I believe this is the match that has been lit.
[01:58:32.948 --> 01:58:33.769]  All right, stay there, Steve.
[01:58:33.789 --> 01:58:36.550]  We've been getting all perspectives and we appreciate yours and respect it.
[01:58:37.010 --> 01:58:40.131]  We're going to call you back, Steve, at our phone system right now.
[01:58:40.171 --> 01:58:42.352]  We'll be back with everybody else in one minute.
[01:58:43.172 --> 01:58:44.633]  On our phone system at 888-201-2244.
[01:58:44.653 --> 01:58:49.157]  We'll continue to cover this at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:49.177 --> 01:58:49.537]  Stay with us.
[01:58:52.399 --> 01:58:53.960]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:54.901 --> 01:58:57.203]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:00.063 --> 01:59:01.644]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:59:01.744 --> 01:59:06.345]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:59:06.485 --> 01:59:09.246]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:09.447 --> 01:59:12.308]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:12.488 --> 01:59:18.330]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:59:18.570 --> 01:59:21.512]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:21.813 --> 01:59:28.718]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:28.778 --> 01:59:31.921]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:59:32.081 --> 01:59:32.281]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:32.341 --> 01:59:33.762]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:37.225 --> 01:59:38.146]  Thank you for listening.
[02:00:21.696 --> 02:00:30.859]  Cats like me and you Have got loves That they adhere to
[02:00:32.722 --> 02:00:40.767]  Right now we're going to do about 15-20 minutes of this to get to everybody's calls.
[02:00:41.347 --> 02:00:47.230]  And we had to get Steve Quayle over from the Genesis phone system in Minnesota over to our studios here that we're developing and building and expanding.
[02:00:47.550 --> 02:00:49.571]  Building TV studios right now as well.
[02:00:53.073 --> 02:00:54.654]  Do we have Steve Quayle on the horn yet?
[02:00:55.967 --> 02:00:56.988]  Okay, we're getting him right now.
[02:00:57.589 --> 02:01:00.353]  Let's go ahead and start taking calls now as we wait.
[02:01:00.453 --> 02:01:02.295]  Sherry in California, I appreciate you holding.
[02:01:02.716 --> 02:01:03.617]  Sherry, you're on the air.
[02:01:03.857 --> 02:01:04.238]  Hello?
[02:01:04.779 --> 02:01:05.039]  Yes.
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:06.701]  Wow, okay.
[02:01:07.562 --> 02:01:10.706]  Yeah, I want to know what it means by we have days and weeks.
[02:01:10.907 --> 02:01:13.270]  I didn't totally understand what that really means.
[02:01:15.822 --> 02:01:18.624]  When Steve Quayle was saying that, or when the media was saying that?
[02:01:19.064 --> 02:01:30.151]  Well, I mean, he's saying that, you know, if the globalists are launching their pandemic flu operation like they did in 1918, like they tried to do in 76, but people refused to take the shots because the first ones to take it got sick or died.
[02:01:30.171 --> 02:01:34.474]  I mean, we know the HPV Gardasil's killing a lot of the girls that take it.
[02:01:34.814 --> 02:01:36.635]  They're practicing just putting this out there.
[02:01:36.675 --> 02:01:40.557]  We get hurt, and then they act like it's no big deal, and they move forward.
[02:01:40.958 --> 02:01:41.838]  I don't know what's happening.
[02:01:41.858 --> 02:01:42.699]  You know, we had Sherry
[02:01:43.639 --> 02:01:47.381]  Tenpenny on Medical Doctor saying, look, it looks like this is engineered.
[02:01:47.481 --> 02:01:48.601]  She's down in Mexico.
[02:01:49.542 --> 02:01:52.623]  But she says they're over-hyping it unless it's going to mutate into something else.
[02:01:53.503 --> 02:01:56.965]  We had Degalon who said he thinks this is a beta test for something bigger down the road.
[02:01:56.985 --> 02:01:57.945]  I hope you have Degalon again.
[02:01:59.758 --> 02:01:59.958]  Huh?
[02:02:00.238 --> 02:02:02.439]  I hope you have D go on again.
[02:02:02.540 --> 02:02:02.980]  No, I will.
[02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:08.963]  But then the head of Homeland Security comes out and says, yeah, this one will probably peter out, but the next one's going to be the big one.
[02:02:09.223 --> 02:02:09.944]  You got the U.N.
[02:02:09.984 --> 02:02:12.125]  saying billions will die for years from bird flu?
[02:02:12.145 --> 02:02:14.346]  I mean, the flu doesn't normally do that.
[02:02:14.486 --> 02:02:19.289]  So we're looking at what they're saying and saying, these are eugenicist murderers.
[02:02:19.729 --> 02:02:21.230]  It's possible they could pull this.
[02:02:21.950 --> 02:02:24.891]  Now Steve says he believes they could be beta testing and this may be it.
[02:02:25.031 --> 02:02:25.451]  I don't know.
[02:02:25.772 --> 02:02:27.412]  But I appreciate your call.
[02:02:27.452 --> 02:02:29.233]  Steve Quayle, we just got him back online.
[02:02:29.273 --> 02:02:29.753]  He heard that.
[02:02:30.193 --> 02:02:33.635]  Steve, I mean, why just all of these pieces of the puzzle?
[02:02:33.695 --> 02:02:35.135]  You think they may be pulling something?
[02:02:35.695 --> 02:02:36.576]  Well, absolutely, Alex.
[02:02:36.676 --> 02:02:39.077]  I don't believe that this is the forerunner.
[02:02:39.157 --> 02:02:41.378]  We know that obviously the G20 met.
[02:02:41.418 --> 02:02:42.778]  We know the Bilderbergers met.
[02:02:42.798 --> 02:02:44.899]  We know that this was the year to go for it.
[02:02:45.399 --> 02:02:55.185]  The idea that Kissinger's statement that by September the guns will be called in, obviously you're going to need a mass event to basically begin the mass roundup and the mass assassinations.
[02:02:55.666 --> 02:03:03.491]  Again, I say to everyone out there that has had the census takers show up, Alex, can I just cover that just for one minute?
[02:03:04.011 --> 02:03:11.476]  I know people that were in the military, who were at some of these Tea Party rallies, I'm talking retired, who had census takers at
[02:03:13.237 --> 02:03:17.519]  No, that's been confirmed.
[02:03:17.559 --> 02:03:18.259]  That's been confirmed.
[02:03:18.279 --> 02:03:19.319]  The FBI was there.
[02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:26.703]  They now call their spies census takers and we covered that in 2000 when I got the long form that supposedly only one in six got.
[02:03:27.083 --> 02:03:29.664]  All the other patriots I know that are prominent got the long form.
[02:03:29.944 --> 02:03:30.845]  Do you own guns?
[02:03:30.905 --> 02:03:32.085]  What are your stocks and bonds?
[02:03:32.105 --> 02:03:33.366]  Do you have a low flush toilet?
[02:03:33.806 --> 02:03:40.829]  You know, all of these questions and saying, by law, you've got to answer this, when the form had a line on it, only the little top part, it was all color of law.
[02:03:41.289 --> 02:03:50.373]  And yes, they're going to use the new census, they're saying it's going to be monthly, as their new little intelligence ops confirmed, with the GPS marking their houses.
[02:03:50.413 --> 02:03:53.594]  Yeah, this is... I mean, they're really trying to do a takeover here.
[02:03:54.054 --> 02:04:10.937]  Right, and everybody should know this, that one of my listeners, one of our mutual listeners, queried the census taker and they even shook their head and said, well this is weird, because they're giving us pre-selected addresses to verify that the people are using so-and-so at this address.
[02:04:11.257 --> 02:04:17.638]  The census taker volunteered the information saying, normally we just go and canvas everybody, but she said this is weird.
[02:04:17.678 --> 02:04:18.398]  No, it's not weird.
[02:04:18.758 --> 02:04:19.399]  It's predetermined.
[02:04:19.519 --> 02:04:21.819]  Alex, the information that's gathered
[02:04:22.219 --> 02:04:23.800]  We're good to go.
[02:04:43.553 --> 02:04:43.874]  I think so.
[02:05:02.213 --> 02:05:06.796]  Now, you've been saying this for years, and I've had the documents, you've had them for years, people didn't, but never got big news.
[02:05:07.236 --> 02:05:27.589]  We now have all these federal training reports, not just the MIAC and others, saying veterans are the number one threat, gun owners, that people quote, buying guns and ammo are terrorists, and then, I didn't even get to this during the main show, I'm telling you, I'm dropping the ball, Obama pushing treaty to ban reloading, this is from Gun Owners of America, and the treaty says they will ban
[02:05:28.910 --> 02:05:42.102]  All private manufacture and reloading, even of factories, and we see the Army two months ago and the armed services saying we're not going to sell our bulk .308, .30-06, .223, 7.62, .39, and all these other ammos, .50 cal, to the private, even, you know, major corporate reloaders.
[02:05:49.549 --> 02:05:51.952]  And so this is confirmed up on Infowars.com.
[02:05:52.233 --> 02:05:54.736]  Directly from Gun Owners of America, Larry Pratt did a video on it.
[02:05:54.756 --> 02:05:55.677]  In fact, I kept forgetting.
[02:05:55.697 --> 02:05:56.999]  Let's get Larry Pratt on the next few days.
[02:05:57.239 --> 02:05:58.541]  Will you tell Rob Dufour I forget?
[02:05:58.982 --> 02:06:00.404]  Just a note, because I write over here and forget.
[02:06:00.764 --> 02:06:02.606]  I'm going to get him on tomorrow, in fact, as soon as we can.
[02:06:03.407 --> 02:06:05.090]  We got that hitting us.
[02:06:05.170 --> 02:06:05.650]  We've got...
[02:06:07.526 --> 02:06:10.408]  I mean, this is just incredible, all the things they're doing, Steve Quayle.
[02:06:10.428 --> 02:06:11.448]  Let's go to another call here.
[02:06:11.788 --> 02:06:14.230]  Let's talk to Dave in Ontario, Canada.
[02:06:14.250 --> 02:06:14.770]  Thanks for holding.
[02:06:14.810 --> 02:06:15.351]  You're a trooper.
[02:06:15.631 --> 02:06:16.711]  You're on the air with Steve Quayle.
[02:06:16.731 --> 02:06:17.072]  Go ahead.
[02:06:17.372 --> 02:06:18.652]  Well, thanks very much, Alex.
[02:06:18.732 --> 02:06:20.093]  Here I am in Ontario.
[02:06:20.493 --> 02:06:23.515]  I want to say something about TTV News yesterday.
[02:06:23.595 --> 02:06:26.317]  Now, you probably recognize Lloyd Robertson.
[02:06:27.437 --> 02:06:30.299]  He's, of course, Alex.
[02:06:30.539 --> 02:06:31.760]  Yes, yes, Steve.
[02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:33.161]  Hold on one second, Dave.
[02:06:34.015 --> 02:06:34.236]  Yep.
[02:06:34.256 --> 02:06:34.797]  Is he on?
[02:06:34.837 --> 02:06:36.279]  I'm sorry, I'm just hearing dead space.
[02:06:36.339 --> 02:06:37.841]  I just thought we got cut off or something.
[02:06:37.881 --> 02:06:39.403]  No, no, his audio is very low.
[02:06:39.443 --> 02:06:41.987]  I've told the guys that we're just getting our phone system here tweaked.
[02:06:43.810 --> 02:06:44.771]  Okay, Dave, speak up.
[02:06:45.232 --> 02:06:47.535]  Anyway, to continue... Can you hear him now, Steve?
[02:06:47.816 --> 02:06:48.276]  Not at all.
[02:06:50.663 --> 02:06:51.264]  Yeah.
[02:06:52.024 --> 02:06:52.665]  Okay.
[02:06:52.825 --> 02:06:55.027]  Listen, make your point and I'll bring it up to Steve.
[02:06:55.047 --> 02:06:55.427]  Go ahead.
[02:06:55.507 --> 02:06:55.707]  Right.
[02:06:56.068 --> 02:07:08.639]  Now, yesterday, Lloyd Robertson appeared on the CTV Newsnet with a travel advisory from voyage.gc.ca, which is the Transport Canada thing.
[02:07:09.279 --> 02:07:14.724]  And he said, Canadians traveling to Mexico should exercise a high degree of caution due to occasional demonstrations and protests.
[02:07:15.546 --> 02:07:22.759]  And he went on to say, Canadians should be particularly vigilant in northern Mexico because of the military and drug cartels.
[02:07:23.620 --> 02:07:24.422]  You could have shootouts.
[02:07:25.765 --> 02:07:27.627]  What a load of horse hockey!
[02:07:27.747 --> 02:07:28.107]  Come on!
[02:07:28.347 --> 02:07:29.508]  Yeah, let me comment on that.
[02:07:29.629 --> 02:07:42.981]  He's saying Transport Canada got up on TV and said, watch out when you go to Mexico because of the shootouts with the police and military, with the drug dealers, one and the same, two different drug gangs fighting, and because of demonstrations.
[02:07:43.001 --> 02:07:43.942]  And that's my issue.
[02:07:44.362 --> 02:07:48.005]  Mexico, and we had State Department experts on about this and others,
[02:07:48.766 --> 02:07:51.809]  Was set to probably be overthrown this summer.
[02:07:51.829 --> 02:07:52.910]  There was a good chance of it.
[02:07:53.070 --> 02:07:54.572]  I mean, rebellion nationwide.
[02:07:55.032 --> 02:08:00.618]  That's why I've had state senators on from Texas who are gearing up martial law on the Texas border, as you know, Steve.
[02:08:01.789 --> 02:08:13.374]  Could all this just be being used as hyping of just a flu, though we know it isn't just a regular flu, but you know, just hyping it, so the government can be the savior, so folks start worrying about their lives and stop worrying about the tyranny?
[02:08:14.074 --> 02:08:24.598]  Well, absolutely, because in essence, if people are getting too close to the truth, the thing you immediately do is you introduce another situation that takes their eyes off of the big picture.
[02:08:24.978 --> 02:08:27.959]  It's just like there's a movement out there to abolish the Fed.
[02:08:28.019 --> 02:08:29.139]  I got news for everybody.
[02:08:29.420 --> 02:08:30.760]  The Fed's already been abolished.
[02:08:30.820 --> 02:08:34.201]  It's now going to be called the International Monetary Authority.
[02:08:34.561 --> 02:08:36.322]  The big money has moved to the Far East.
[02:08:36.362 --> 02:08:37.482]  This is a setup, Alex.
[02:08:37.502 --> 02:08:38.443]  This is a total setup.
[02:08:38.783 --> 02:08:48.466]  So the thing that I think that most everyone must understand, that the International League could care less about nationalities, they could care less about loyalties.
[02:08:48.946 --> 02:08:53.348]  All they want is the raw material, and they're the pirates of the world at large.
[02:08:54.228 --> 02:08:58.752]  They use false patriotism to control us while they're busy destroying the nation.
[02:08:58.992 --> 02:09:02.434]  And then when you have their own secret documents, their real threat is the red, white, and blue.
[02:09:02.494 --> 02:09:04.936]  Thank you, caller, David, Ontario.
[02:09:04.996 --> 02:09:05.637]  Thank you, Carter.
[02:09:05.877 --> 02:09:07.278]  Thank you, Carter in Louisiana.
[02:09:07.298 --> 02:09:08.198]  You're on the air with Steve Quayle.
[02:09:08.219 --> 02:09:08.699]  Go ahead, Carter.
[02:09:08.979 --> 02:09:10.260]  Hey, guys, thank you.
[02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:35.289]  Hey, uh, one thing I wanted to bring up, it's a little bit of my own analysis, I think you guys will see that this is probably true, they, uh, they see us reaching critical mass with the Tea Parties, conservative estimates with 2,000 parties with only 500 people, basically bringing the numbers to a million, but we know maybe probably one out of ten showed up, and then places like Atlanta and, you know, they had 40,000 people that showed up there.
[02:09:35.869 --> 02:09:50.634]  So what they know is, I think that another brick in Steve's argument is why now isn't the time, is because they realize they can't put the lid back on things if they don't usurp us now, then they'll not have a chance in the future.
[02:09:50.834 --> 02:09:52.195]  Well, that's what I've been saying for months.
[02:09:52.375 --> 02:10:01.721]  The awakening to world government, the awakening to the New World Order, with them openly announcing it, then they need some crisis as they emerge to play the part of saviors.
[02:10:01.821 --> 02:10:08.405]  Attacking Iran, attacking Pakistan, further global financial plunge, staged terror attacks, bird flu.
[02:10:08.425 --> 02:10:10.126]  You know, I've said those are the cards.
[02:10:10.146 --> 02:10:16.190]  They can play one, two, three, four, five, six of the cards, or they can play none of the cards, but I don't see
[02:10:16.650 --> 02:10:18.832]  Yes, and the brick is absolutely correct, but I think where Alex, the thing, look, I pray
[02:10:35.323 --> 02:10:40.168]  With tears running down my cheeks that I'm wrong, but I know this sounds arrogant, but I'm not.
[02:10:40.588 --> 02:10:43.611]  The reason I'm not is because it's not just one event.
[02:10:43.991 --> 02:10:47.635]  The global collapse of the financial world at all is engineered.
[02:10:47.735 --> 02:10:48.776]  Remember this.
[02:10:49.336 --> 02:10:55.422]  The number one prime directive of the New World Order and all of its minions is order out of chaos.
[02:10:55.962 --> 02:10:56.122]  Hello?
[02:11:19.298 --> 02:11:21.984]  Yes, you know the thing is, I'm listening to the crisis.
[02:11:22.024 --> 02:11:28.397]  You know the thing is, I think we could deflect this if we could just get involved locally and deal with this locally at a local level.
[02:11:29.198 --> 02:11:29.479]  Wrong.
[02:11:31.061 --> 02:11:34.522]  I say that, I don't mean any disrespect to your caller, and I'll just get right to it.
[02:11:34.923 --> 02:11:43.146]  The situation is, is that the critical mass, Alex, that, you know, is representing the Tea Party, we obviously saw the belittlement, the ridicule, etc.
[02:11:43.626 --> 02:11:46.167]  This is where the biological card is being played.
[02:11:46.207 --> 02:11:50.269]  Now look, when you win the game, you lay down all your cards at once, okay?
[02:11:50.789 --> 02:11:52.490]  We've seen cards being played.
[02:11:52.530 --> 02:11:54.892]  We've seen the vilification of the Patriots.
[02:11:54.912 --> 02:11:57.294]  We've seen anybody who's a Constitutionalist.
[02:11:57.334 --> 02:11:58.835]  You know, the whole list of DHS.
[02:11:58.875 --> 02:12:12.685]  And now, the last card in my mind that triggered this, which, by the way, I said would be the case even ten years ago on talk radio, that the systematic elimination of returning veterans who could present a problem.
[02:12:12.725 --> 02:12:16.428]  I said they will be systematically isolated and terminated, okay?
[02:12:16.668 --> 02:12:17.889]  Well, then I was a crackpot.
[02:12:18.269 --> 02:12:23.773]  When that card was played, Alex, that's when the whole thing went into effect, in my opinion.
[02:12:24.153 --> 02:12:29.777]  Now, I really do believe that, you know, time is going to be very, very critical.
[02:12:29.857 --> 02:12:42.626]  And somebody just sent me an email saying, don't forget that I think April 30th is Walsh Purge's night, which is the second most satanic important date on the satanic ritual calendar.
[02:12:42.926 --> 02:12:44.327]  After Sam Hain or Salwin.
[02:12:45.107 --> 02:12:48.428]  Yeah, thank you so much, George.
[02:12:51.869 --> 02:12:55.111]  It does appear they're playing their cards, they're moving into high gear.
[02:12:56.091 --> 02:12:57.852]  Things are accelerating.
[02:12:58.572 --> 02:13:00.813]  And I've been telling folks we're entering the danger zone.
[02:13:00.833 --> 02:13:03.854]  I don't know if this is it, but we are in the danger zone.
[02:13:04.474 --> 02:13:06.575]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nathan in Texas.
[02:13:06.595 --> 02:13:07.535]  Nathan, you're on the air.
[02:13:07.555 --> 02:13:09.856]  Yes sir, this is Nathan.
[02:13:11.443 --> 02:13:30.576]  I have a question, earlier you talked about aspartame and how it was grown in vats and I'm a type 1 diabetic and my insulin is also grown in vats and in the United States they have banned pork and beef insulin which is extracted from
[02:13:31.617 --> 02:13:36.382]  That's right.
[02:13:36.722 --> 02:13:45.971]  They have pharmacological bacteria and crops that actually in the crops or in the bacteria secrete the insulin.
[02:13:46.011 --> 02:13:46.752]  I knew about that.
[02:13:47.252 --> 02:13:48.733]  And they also secrete the estrogen.
[02:13:48.753 --> 02:13:50.835]  When you hear it's synthetic, it's not really synthetic.
[02:13:51.236 --> 02:13:52.757]  It's coming from another organism.
[02:13:53.738 --> 02:13:58.062]  Just like they spray most of the meat you buy now so they can sell you rotten meat.
[02:13:59.123 --> 02:14:08.591]  In Latin it translates, the English translation is virus eating, bacteria eating virus.
[02:14:09.111 --> 02:14:12.173]  And they spray this liquid vaccine on most your meats.
[02:14:12.554 --> 02:14:14.636]  The problem is it's bred in tanks.
[02:14:15.276 --> 02:14:22.539]  That come from fetal tissue stock in many cases, so it's being grown in dead human stock in these giant tanks.
[02:14:22.579 --> 02:14:23.639]  Folks, you can't make this up.
[02:14:24.259 --> 02:14:26.100]  And then that's sprayed on your meat.
[02:14:26.180 --> 02:14:28.881]  I mean, Steve, again, who comes up with stuff like this?
[02:14:29.685 --> 02:14:32.528]  Uh, literally out of the cauldrons of hell.
[02:14:33.049 --> 02:14:39.756]  You know, Jesus made the statement that until he puts an end to the evil, there will be no end to the evil.
[02:14:39.776 --> 02:14:40.717]  And I want to share something.
[02:14:41.078 --> 02:14:48.466]  While these people are so absolutely ready to sacrifice nine-tenths of the world's planetary population,
[02:14:49.006 --> 02:14:51.507]  I think people who are Christians have better realize this.
[02:14:51.927 --> 02:14:53.588]  They have got to stand up.
[02:14:53.648 --> 02:15:01.471]  They have got to take back the ground that they've given, because there's one thing more powerful than all the power of hell, and it's called the blood of Jesus.
[02:15:01.491 --> 02:15:05.773]  That simply means this, is that God is on his people's side.
[02:15:05.833 --> 02:15:14.416]  And Alex, what's strange to me is that the Christian churches that are rolling over for the New World Order, how can they prepare their people except to prepare them for slaughter?
[02:15:14.616 --> 02:15:15.797]  Well, they're bought and paid for.
[02:15:16.037 --> 02:15:18.458]  They're bought and paid for through the clergy response teams.
[02:15:18.678 --> 02:15:19.278]  Absolutely.
[02:15:19.358 --> 02:15:23.220]  So my inbox is filling up right now after your show.
[02:15:23.641 --> 02:15:29.504]  And I mean, the point is that, during your show, and I'm sure it will fill up after the show, but that's what people have got to understand.
[02:15:29.644 --> 02:15:33.986]  I didn't mean to be controversial with the man, but it's too late to get involved locally.
[02:15:34.266 --> 02:15:34.746]  You know what?
[02:15:34.786 --> 02:15:38.128]  When I get an email that says, we ought to do this, we ought to do that, you know where that goes?
[02:15:38.488 --> 02:15:39.709]  It goes in my junk pile.
[02:15:40.029 --> 02:15:42.650]  Because that usually means you do it, Alex, or Steve, you do it.
[02:15:42.790 --> 02:15:45.892]  Fortunately, there are people that are standing up with us, not behind us.
[02:15:46.252 --> 02:16:06.163]  But the point that has to be gotten at this is, ladies and gentlemen, based on the New World Order's timeline, based on everything getting ready to happen in the Middle East, getting everything that's going on in the world of economics, every area that you have known that was normal or you could trust in, it's being taken out from under you.
[02:16:06.544 --> 02:16:12.747]  And that's why I say this, that the only trust that you can have nowadays is to have a right relationship with the Living God.
[02:16:12.947 --> 02:16:14.408]  Alex, this is biblical
[02:16:14.488 --> 02:16:15.669]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[02:16:34.183 --> 02:16:36.104]  I've got a quick question and a quick comment.
[02:16:36.925 --> 02:16:52.354]  Quick question, I was wondering if you saw that the Obama legal team is pushing for the right for military recruiters to approach minors in California where a law was just passed that would prevent such from happening.
[02:16:52.634 --> 02:17:05.458]  Yeah, well, they've gone in and are brainwashing the kids in the schools, setting up, you know, recruiting in the schools, and they threaten them with arrest if they don't sign up for the military, telling them it's the law, and then the guys that get caught doing that get promoted.
[02:17:06.038 --> 02:17:15.021]  Also, the new head of the Department of Transportation is the head of MADD, and they want warrantless checkpoints, breathalyzers for everybody at checkpoints, no more Fourth Amendment.
[02:17:15.761 --> 02:17:17.483]  DNA testing on the side of the road.
[02:17:17.843 --> 02:17:19.105]  I mean, hell is being released.
[02:17:19.165 --> 02:17:21.807]  Everything Bush did is being expanded by Obama.
[02:17:22.108 --> 02:17:25.271]  You've got Obama zombies stumbling around, having no idea what's happening.
[02:17:25.731 --> 02:17:26.612]  Totally deceived.
[02:17:27.553 --> 02:17:29.495]  Again, Obama is their closer.
[02:17:29.996 --> 02:17:31.097]  I mean, I agree with Steve.
[02:17:31.137 --> 02:17:35.461]  The cards are being laid on the table right now, and it's just going to get more insane from here on out.
[02:17:36.082 --> 02:17:37.083]  But, anything else, Tom?
[02:17:38.144 --> 02:17:39.885]  Yeah, I just had one quick comment.
[02:17:40.125 --> 02:17:45.047]  I mean, absolutely no offense to anyone as far as they're religious, believe.
[02:17:45.587 --> 02:17:47.007]  Myself, I'm personally religious.
[02:17:48.208 --> 02:17:59.132]  But, you know, I'm completing my master's degree in political science and economics, and I've got a lot of friends at my university that I try to turn on to your show, but a lot of them just feel that
[02:17:59.924 --> 02:18:06.371]  There's a little bit too much religious doctrine being introduced in the sense of blood of Christ.
[02:18:06.652 --> 02:18:13.239]  Well, I mean, the issue here is that I have a news show, but I do have Christian guests on and I don't censor what they say and do.
[02:18:13.399 --> 02:18:17.264]  And I think, you know, you've got all this humanist religion and environmental religion.
[02:18:17.304 --> 02:18:20.968]  It's just repackaged, being pushed everywhere and all this Gaia stuff.
[02:18:21.388 --> 02:18:27.490]  And we've studied the New World Order, we know who they are, we know who their God is, and we're telling people the final level of this.
[02:18:27.831 --> 02:18:37.194]  Folks don't want to look at our track record, don't want to look at all the accurate things we've done here, and don't want to test their spirit, their instincts, their gut, their sixth sense, then fine.
[02:18:37.955 --> 02:18:39.075]  But this is free speech.
[02:18:39.095 --> 02:18:41.176]  People are like, oh my God, Christian stuff, I don't want to hear it.
[02:18:41.296 --> 02:18:48.119]  Right, I want to address that, Alex, because first of all, this Christian, especially me now, he's taking a shot at me, so I want the right to respond, okay?
[02:18:49.279 --> 02:18:52.521]  The thing is, he's a political science major and an economics major.
[02:18:53.182 --> 02:18:56.684]  No offense, he sounds very young, but he hasn't been at this for 36 years.
[02:18:56.724 --> 02:18:59.826]  He doesn't have the track record, and I make no apologies for Jesus.
[02:18:59.846 --> 02:19:10.493]  These people are out worshipping Satan, putting pictures of the President of the United States up on the presidential seal with his arms outstretched and the crown of thorns on his head.
[02:19:10.894 --> 02:19:12.775]  The thing is, look, I make no apologies.
[02:19:12.815 --> 02:19:18.899]  This guy has nothing to offer, and quite candidly, I categorically reject him.
[02:19:21.101 --> 02:19:29.928]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:19:30.129 --> 02:19:38.216]  I mean, when Obama goes to speak now at a university, in a church, they cover up Jesus in Latin like they're vampires or something.
[02:19:39.096 --> 02:19:42.619]  And I understand, sir, that you're saying, I mean, I actually understand what you're saying.
[02:19:42.639 --> 02:19:46.583]  There's people so afraid of hearing anything Christian that you're
[02:19:46.903 --> 02:20:02.739]  You're trying to pass the show on to them, but they need to intellectually open up a little bit more and not be so scared of other ideas and other things and not, you know, I mean, even though they hate Christians, why throw the baby out with the bathwater just because they're so afraid of hearing any of that?
[02:20:03.897 --> 02:20:11.066]  I guarantee if I talk to your friends who don't like this, they would say, I don't want to hear about Luciferianism and Bohemian Grove and the occult because that doesn't exist.
[02:20:11.607 --> 02:20:11.887]  No, no.
[02:20:11.987 --> 02:20:15.732]  Even if you don't believe in anything spiritual, the elites do.
[02:20:16.233 --> 02:20:21.099]  And from a sociological perspective, they are manifesting hell on earth because they believe in it.
[02:20:21.139 --> 02:20:21.660]  Go ahead and call her.
[02:20:23.649 --> 02:20:41.004]  I agree with you, like I said myself, you know, I'm religious personally, but all I was trying to say is I feel that sometimes you could more widely spread your image and maybe, you know, not scare people away if the religious overtones were just slightly turned down.
[02:20:41.024 --> 02:20:42.065]  Alright, listen, I hear your point.
[02:20:42.246 --> 02:20:45.008]  I mean, I hear your point, but I'm on with Steve McCollum, but I want to say this.
[02:20:45.549 --> 02:20:46.710]  We're not here, though,
[02:20:47.390 --> 02:20:49.992]  To tailor our message to try to reach as many people.
[02:20:50.272 --> 02:20:56.036]  We're here to tell what we believe is the truth, what we believe has been revealed, what we've learned, and we're not compromising.
[02:20:56.096 --> 02:20:56.377]  Steve?
[02:20:56.897 --> 02:20:58.938]  Religious is a wonderful buzzword.
[02:20:59.059 --> 02:21:01.260]  It is not religion, it is relationship.
[02:21:01.300 --> 02:21:01.921]  And here's the deal.
[02:21:02.281 --> 02:21:10.327]  Everybody quotes the book of Revelation, everybody talks about all the prophecies, but when it comes to Jesus, and when it comes to anything, he's taboo, okay?
[02:21:10.347 --> 02:21:11.708]  But when it comes to Lucifer Satanism,
[02:21:12.308 --> 02:21:16.132]  Anything goes except Jesus, and to that I categorically reject the argument.
[02:21:16.232 --> 02:21:17.673]  Alex, I'm just picking on the caller.
[02:21:17.993 --> 02:21:19.955]  I'm saying people that bring that up are religious.
[02:21:19.995 --> 02:21:20.736]  What does that mean?
[02:21:21.036 --> 02:21:22.577]  A Satanist is religious.
[02:21:23.438 --> 02:21:26.061]  A child sacrificer is religious.
[02:21:26.101 --> 02:21:32.426]  So the point is that that is an argument thrown in to take away from the validity of our information.
[02:21:32.446 --> 02:21:35.089]  But I mean, Steve, look at all the occultism everywhere.
[02:21:35.149 --> 02:21:37.411]  Look at all the pyramids and all the Kabbalah.
[02:21:38.011 --> 02:21:45.497]  I mean, the world is awash in occultism and Harry Potter, but then we talk about Christianity, and it's like, AHHHHH!
[02:21:45.537 --> 02:21:46.618]  I just gotta say this.
[02:21:46.738 --> 02:21:49.120]  It is an invalid intellectual argument.
[02:21:49.220 --> 02:21:59.388]  It's nothing but a personal opinion, and again, I would hope for the gentleman's sake that he learns to turn religion into relationship and understand this, that it's a far different cry.
[02:21:59.428 --> 02:22:01.009]  And Alex, I make no apologies for it.
[02:22:01.369 --> 02:22:05.114]  Listen, the people that have ears to hear are listening.
[02:22:05.174 --> 02:22:07.296]  The people that have eyes to see are seeing.
[02:22:07.617 --> 02:22:09.339]  The people that are ready to do are doing.
[02:22:09.619 --> 02:22:14.765]  And when you do what you do, and I do what I do, and people have done nothing, you say, well, you guys would have a bigger audience.
[02:22:15.346 --> 02:22:16.287]  I've got to tell you something.
[02:22:16.407 --> 02:22:20.132]  I'm only out to speak to those who have ears to hear and eyes to see.
[02:22:20.572 --> 02:22:27.618]  No, I hear you, but I understand you're rebuking the people that can't stand hearing the show.
[02:22:27.978 --> 02:22:34.103]  He was just mentioning what does he do about them, and my answer to them is they need to get a little bit thicker skin if it's so upsetting to them.
[02:22:34.123 --> 02:22:35.284]  But see, they're afraid.
[02:22:35.364 --> 02:22:36.825]  Something in them doesn't want them to hear this.
[02:22:37.805 --> 02:22:42.186]  Because they don't want to have to deal with God, or his demands, or his judgments.
[02:22:42.266 --> 02:22:44.767]  And see, that's something that you cannot deal with that.
[02:22:45.047 --> 02:22:51.528]  Everybody says, God bless America, and you ask, okay, based on the nature of a living God, how can he bless evil?
[02:22:51.688 --> 02:22:55.009]  Because the only one that's promulgating or putting forth evil is Satan.
[02:22:55.029 --> 02:22:58.170]  So it's a contradictory mindset, in my opinion.
[02:22:58.590 --> 02:22:58.770]  Yeah.
[02:22:59.011 --> 02:22:59.952]  Okay, let's go ahead.
[02:22:59.972 --> 02:23:02.735]  I mean, you can deny that God and the devil exist, folks.
[02:23:03.396 --> 02:23:05.218]  Okay, you can try to deny that all day.
[02:23:05.699 --> 02:23:08.923]  The issue is you can't deny that the world leaders are a bunch of Luciferians.
[02:23:09.223 --> 02:23:10.164]  That's a fact.
[02:23:10.224 --> 02:23:11.045]  Now, why is that?
[02:23:11.246 --> 02:23:12.047]  What are you going to do about it?
[02:23:12.607 --> 02:23:13.769]  Let's go ahead and talk to...
[02:23:15.697 --> 02:23:16.837]  Bill in Connecticut.
[02:23:16.877 --> 02:23:17.637]  Bill, you're on the air.
[02:23:17.657 --> 02:23:18.057]  Go ahead.
[02:23:18.497 --> 02:23:19.318]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[02:23:19.638 --> 02:23:19.878]  Good.
[02:23:20.298 --> 02:23:20.978]  How you doing, Steve?
[02:23:21.018 --> 02:23:21.738]  God bless you, man.
[02:23:21.958 --> 02:23:22.358]  Thank you.
[02:23:22.378 --> 02:23:29.199]  Hey, guys, I know what you've been talking about all day here today, and it's all great, but I just wanted to throw this at you.
[02:23:29.939 --> 02:23:34.620]  Did you know that Air Force One buzzed downtown New York City this morning?
[02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:35.580]  Yep.
[02:23:35.640 --> 02:23:37.701]  Mayor Bloomberg is flipping out.
[02:23:37.761 --> 02:23:44.402]  These guys had fighter jets and everything flying all around downtown Manhattan, and they thought that there was another terrorist attack on them.
[02:23:45.569 --> 02:23:47.150]  Can you think of the symbolism of that?
[02:23:47.190 --> 02:23:49.271]  Yeah, think of the symbolism of that.
[02:23:49.291 --> 02:23:51.413]  You've got Air Force One over the Statue of Liberty.
[02:23:51.473 --> 02:23:58.357]  I'm told by people that saw the event, caller, that the, you know, Air Force One literally flew over the Statue of Liberty.
[02:23:58.837 --> 02:24:04.661]  That, basically, that's a violation of the protocol of the New York airspace, but I guess if you're the commander-in-chief, you can do what you want.
[02:24:04.961 --> 02:24:13.366]  And then, meanwhile, you've got earthquakes, huge ones, and flu, and what is this, where they freak out New York, buzzing downtown, right where the towers were?
[02:24:14.605 --> 02:24:16.107]  Well, I think it's important.
[02:24:16.187 --> 02:24:31.000]  The towers going down, and listen to this Alex, on the largest area of real estate that has been, whether people want to admit it or not, the Mystery Babylon part of the Book of Revelations is still interesting.
[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:35.484]  The kings of the earth commit fornication with this entity known as Mystery Babylon.
[02:24:35.824 --> 02:24:36.205]  I think it's
[02:24:36.845 --> 02:24:51.069]  Fascinating now when you were talking Alex just moments ago about the religious quote images of Jesus being covered up and in its place the triangle with the with the luminous message that the face in the triangle is now the all-seeing eye.
[02:24:51.449 --> 02:24:58.351]  I think that what we're seeing is the announcement and quite candidly I think in a cult terminology I think this is what David Wilkerson is worried about.
[02:24:58.431 --> 02:25:00.492]  I think New York is going to get hit with such an incredible
[02:25:00.712 --> 02:25:02.794]  What else was Bloomberg saying?
[02:25:02.854 --> 02:25:06.758]  I saw the report about the buzzing, but I didn't see much more than that.
[02:25:06.778 --> 02:25:07.278]  It just came in here.
[02:25:07.298 --> 02:25:07.919]  What specifically happened?
[02:25:23.595 --> 02:25:25.056]  Well, no, they had it on TV.
[02:25:25.616 --> 02:25:34.523]  Bloomberg, apparently afterwards, they flipped out, but they had F-16s with, along with the Air Force One, flying around downtown.
[02:25:34.743 --> 02:25:40.587]  And people were flipping out and literally going out of the buildings, leaving the buildings, thinking that something else was going to happen.
[02:25:41.868 --> 02:25:43.710]  You know, that was the first thing this morning.
[02:25:43.790 --> 02:25:49.674]  Bloomberg flipped out and called a press conference pertaining to it.
[02:25:49.714 --> 02:25:51.956]  The White House sat there and said it was a photo op.
[02:25:53.011 --> 02:25:54.252]  I don't know.
[02:26:13.812 --> 02:26:25.504]  I just thought that was very interesting, that you've got this stuff going on, these guys doing this whole thing, and I wanted to ask you, Steve, what do you think about Revelation 2 and 9?
[02:26:25.544 --> 02:26:33.712]  2 and 9, where it talks about the synagogue of Satan, those who claim to be Jews who are not.
[02:26:36.109 --> 02:26:47.123]  Yep, I gotta tell you something, I can't go into it in a short time because we've only got four minutes, but if you want to send me an email, you have my email, Steve777 at SteveQuayle.com, I'll answer you on the email.
[02:26:47.183 --> 02:26:50.588]  Let me say this, I gotta let Bill go, I don't have time to go to J.D., Bob, and Eric.
[02:26:50.988 --> 02:26:55.410]  I apologize, but I've already done four and a half hours here, or four hours, twenty-seven minutes to be technical.
[02:26:55.811 --> 02:26:58.112]  I've got to go to a meeting, got to take care of stuff here at the office.
[02:26:58.452 --> 02:27:00.193]  Jason Burmas is coming back from New York today.
[02:27:00.233 --> 02:27:02.554]  He may be live tonight, nine to midnight, probably is.
[02:27:03.034 --> 02:27:07.177]  I may pop in if that's the case, I'm going to be down here anyways, nine to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[02:27:07.237 --> 02:27:08.737]  Steve Quayle, I know you've got your own show coming up.
[02:27:08.998 --> 02:27:15.201]  Steve, I want to thank you for spending so much time with us today, and let's get you to pop in throughout the week as things unfold, okay?
[02:27:15.501 --> 02:27:16.021]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:27:16.041 --> 02:27:23.307]  And again, watch Thursday through the week because obviously things are going to get very, very, very clear to a lot of people.
[02:27:23.347 --> 02:27:23.867]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:27:23.927 --> 02:27:24.588]  God bless you.
[02:27:24.648 --> 02:27:25.048]  CPL.com.
[02:27:25.088 --> 02:27:25.428]  Thank you.
[02:27:25.488 --> 02:27:26.549]  Infowars.com.
[02:27:26.609 --> 02:27:28.350]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:27:29.071 --> 02:27:32.553]  We're going to cut back into our interview with Dr. Sherry Tinpenny from Mexico.
[02:27:32.573 --> 02:27:33.854]  A lot of key stuff covered.
[02:27:34.195 --> 02:27:39.118]  Coming up right now as we end this segment, going back into transmission and a break.
[02:27:39.839 --> 02:27:40.839]  So much is going on.
[02:27:40.979 --> 02:27:44.162]  I think this is all over hype, but maybe preparation for something else.
[02:27:44.582 --> 02:27:45.022]  Who knows?
[02:27:45.062 --> 02:27:46.663]  Governments are really acting crazy.
[02:27:46.963 --> 02:27:49.383]  So we have a lot of different perspectives from all angles.
[02:27:50.004 --> 02:27:52.664]  You'll hear another one of those angles from this doctor right now.
[02:27:52.784 --> 02:27:55.625]  So again, please continue to spread the word about this show.
[02:27:55.945 --> 02:28:01.827]  I think we're giving you the biggest wide spectrum analysis where you can make your own decisions.
[02:28:01.847 --> 02:28:11.410]  You hear the whole spectrum of data so you can decide what you think is going on so we can take your calls, reintegrate that info and kind of have our own little think tanks here to understand what's happening.
[02:28:11.730 --> 02:28:13.972]  We have the power to defeat the New World Order.
[02:28:14.012 --> 02:28:15.993]  We can take action and get it done with God's help.
[02:28:16.534 --> 02:28:17.274]  Spread the word.
[02:28:17.334 --> 02:28:19.916]  Understand the globalists have staged terror attacks before.
[02:28:20.236 --> 02:28:21.677]  They are obsessed with bio-weapons.
[02:28:21.698 --> 02:28:23.719]  They did introduce cancer viruses and vaccines.
[02:28:24.319 --> 02:28:25.801]  And so, they're capable of anything.
[02:28:26.101 --> 02:28:29.043]  That's why we're taking this so incredibly serious.
[02:28:29.323 --> 02:28:30.264]  Great job to my crew.
[02:28:30.444 --> 02:28:31.705]  Four and a half hours of great work.
[02:28:31.985 --> 02:28:36.769]  We'll be back tomorrow live, 11 to 3 p.m., with more guests, more insight from around the world.
[02:28:37.049 --> 02:28:38.630]  I'm Alex Jones, signing off.
[02:28:38.830 --> 02:28:39.771]  God bless you all.
[02:28:39.951 --> 02:28:40.752]  We shall prevail.
