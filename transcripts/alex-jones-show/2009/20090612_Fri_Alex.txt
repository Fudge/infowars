[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.104]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:00:05.686 --> 00:00:08.492]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:35.768]  Ladies and gentlemen, until about 45 after or so, we have Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on the line with us today.
[00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:46.518]  And Dr. Roberts, of course, was the former editor of the Wall Street Journal, former head of policy at the Department of the Treasury, number two there, the father of Reaganomics.
[00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.882]  Uh, has been listed by many publications as one of the top 10 or top 50 economists out there.
[00:00:52.563 --> 00:00:55.184]  And you have all these fake neocons that he was a big critic of.
[00:00:55.625 --> 00:01:01.589]  He hoped Obama was going to do what he said he did, and I know lately he's been saying, my gosh, it looks like he could actually be worse if that was possible.
[00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.651]  Bush only tripled government, Obama's doubled it in one year, so that'd be...
[00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:07.399]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:01:26.328 --> 00:01:26.708]  You bet.
[00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.370]  Break it down.
[00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:38.578]  I mean, there's a lot going on, but what state are we in right now with the White House grabbing industries, telling banks what to do, saying nobody can audit them, they're above the law.
[00:01:39.258 --> 00:01:40.960]  Obama going back on everything he said.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.121]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[00:01:44.342 --> 00:01:48.466]  Yes, it looks like pursuit of power has gone to their heads.
[00:01:49.707 --> 00:01:50.668]  I certainly agree.
[00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:54.851]  And I think it's hurting Obama, a lot of his
[00:01:56.216 --> 00:02:00.258]  Fans are disturbed about him.
[00:02:00.738 --> 00:02:04.639]  And of course the Republicans will turn that to their advantage sooner or later.
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.502]  And then so we'll be thrown out of the fire back into the frying pan and back and forth.
[00:02:12.542 --> 00:02:15.943]  How does this end when both parties are owned by the same corrupt interest?
[00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:19.665]  And that whorehouse called Washington just eats, drinks, and marries.
[00:02:20.325 --> 00:02:23.446]  Not even caring if the country collapses, they'll just move to Switzerland.
[00:02:23.803 --> 00:02:28.626]  Yeah, it's really kind of like the French government, isn't it, before the French Revolution?
[00:02:29.947 --> 00:02:34.070]  I mean, that's how out of touch both parties are.
[00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.455]  I think what may happen, Alex, of course I don't know.
[00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:41.595]  Nobody can know.
[00:02:42.636 --> 00:02:49.701]  I think what may happen is that just the general overreach of the United States government, the economic,
[00:02:50.842 --> 00:03:04.452]  Overreach, you know, the foreign policy, the military, they just overreach in so many places that they get so many problems that they suffer a huge defeat.
[00:03:05.613 --> 00:03:09.455]  I think defeat is what they're headed for.
[00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:16.200]  If we think about the Iraq War and all the trouble, the long, drawn-out process until we finally
[00:03:17.103 --> 00:03:20.906]  Uh, caught on and started paying off the insurgents with money.
[00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:31.075]  If you think about all that trouble, why do they want to get in ten times as much trouble in Pakistan and Afghanistan?
[00:03:31.115 --> 00:03:34.778]  Much larger, more rugged countries, meaner people.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.743]  It doesn't make a great deal of sense.
[00:03:39.763 --> 00:03:41.844]  You would think they would have learned.
[00:03:41.925 --> 00:03:44.607]  Good gosh, we came close to
[00:03:45.512 --> 00:03:50.695]  Getting our butts kicked in Iraq, what do we want to take even worse risk?
[00:03:51.175 --> 00:04:03.641]  And then if you look at the financial policy and you say, well look, we let the financial gangsters make fools of us and deregulate them and turn them loose.
[00:04:03.681 --> 00:04:10.164]  They've wiped out half of the savings of the American people, people who
[00:04:12.472 --> 00:04:25.958]  Denied themselves the consumption and put away money for their old age, and now the banksters have destroyed half of it, and we let them con us into deregulating them and giving them a free hand to rip people off.
[00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.520]  And now, how do we respond to that?
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.321]  Well, we give them trillions of dollars!
[00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:41.985]  But we won't do anything for the homeowners, and we'll let the car companies go bankrupt because we want to bust the unions.
[00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:44.865]  We won't let a bank go bankrupt.
[00:04:46.646 --> 00:04:49.766]  And how do they think that plays with people?
[00:04:49.826 --> 00:04:54.487]  I mean, even the brainwashed American public sees through all that.
[00:04:54.507 --> 00:04:58.408]  And then the question is these deficits.
[00:04:59.228 --> 00:05:04.109]  You know, like, this year the deficit is four or five times bigger than last year.
[00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.690]  It just cannot be financed.
[00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.911]  So, and next year, the same thing again.
[00:05:13.545 --> 00:05:15.347]  I don't
[00:05:44.266 --> 00:06:05.443]  Threaten the dollar's role as a reserve currency, and of course, that weakens the power of the United States, because the real power of the country is not based on some kind of inherent right that we have, it's based on the fact that we have the reserve currency and can pay our bills with our own currency.
[00:06:06.423 --> 00:06:13.669]  So if we lose that, we've lost the bulk of our power, and yet they're taking great risk with
[00:06:14.372 --> 00:06:15.513]  We're good to go.
[00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:56.010]  One is another sharp decline in the stock market in which equity holders flee from stocks for the safety of government bonds.
[00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.932]  That's one way they can finance the deficit.
[00:07:00.473 --> 00:07:03.055]  The only other way is to print the money.
[00:07:04.636 --> 00:07:08.899]  And if they print the money, and the world will notice it.
[00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:13.302]  In fact, the Chinese have been complaining for six months or more.
[00:07:14.292 --> 00:07:19.536]  About the possibility that we're going to print the money to finance us.
[00:07:19.796 --> 00:07:22.718]  And they keep complaining in louder and louder voices.
[00:07:22.798 --> 00:07:32.285]  And recently, in Beijing, the audience that the Treasury Secretary Geithner had, laughed at him!
[00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:43.614]  Because he was so stupid, he didn't even understand that he cannot simultaneously tell the Chinese
[00:07:44.727 --> 00:07:49.091]  That he wants a strong dollar, but he wants the Chinese currency to rise.
[00:07:51.433 --> 00:07:53.074]  And that their investments are safe.
[00:07:53.435 --> 00:07:55.016]  Their dollar investments are safe.
[00:07:55.036 --> 00:08:01.662]  Well, obviously, if the Chinese let their currency rise relative to the dollar, their dollar holdings are worth less.
[00:08:03.563 --> 00:08:05.525]  And they're not safe.
[00:08:06.426 --> 00:08:08.688]  They're getting less dollars.
[00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:12.031]  But Dr. Roberts, I mean, Geithner, that little
[00:08:13.266 --> 00:08:13.886]  I don't know Alex, maybe.
[00:08:13.906 --> 00:08:16.148]  But it's a terrific risk to take.
[00:08:16.188 --> 00:08:16.908]  We're the superpower.
[00:08:16.948 --> 00:08:17.769]  We're the financial superpower.
[00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:18.149]  We rule the world.
[00:08:40.123 --> 00:08:40.304]  I think.
[00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:47.346]  No, I agree, but I think he's so arrogant.
[00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:49.167]  I mean, I think he's so arrogant he thought he'd get away with it.
[00:08:49.187 --> 00:08:59.253]  I agree with you that it's a big risk and that the luster, the aura, the cloak of infallibility of the private fellow reserve and these bankers and these corporate crooks is starting to fade.
[00:08:59.293 --> 00:09:00.873]  And you're right, that's a danger.
[00:09:00.893 --> 00:09:08.137]  I mean, it's good to have their power fade, but it's also in a way bad because when they fall over like a giant oak tree on us, it could crush us.
[00:09:08.638 --> 00:09:10.299]  But I guess it's better than being their slaves.
[00:09:10.359 --> 00:09:13.880]  But the question I've got for you then on this issue is, where does it go?
[00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:15.722]  I don't know.
[00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:34.483]  Well, so far, Alex, it's going just as I predicted.
[00:09:34.503 --> 00:09:35.404]  I said that
[00:09:58.516 --> 00:10:13.380]  When they announced they were going to buy a trillion dollars of debt, $300 billion in treasury bonds, $700 billion in mortgage bonds, I said, well, that's monetization, and that's going to drive up the interest rates, drive down the bond prices.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.220]  And lo and behold, exactly what happened.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:23.382]  Interest rates have risen on the treasuries, and the prices, which is the reverse of that, have gone down.
[00:10:23.402 --> 00:10:24.582]  And it's harder to get a home.
[00:10:27.717 --> 00:10:40.926]  What Geithner thought, or Bernanke, of all of them, thought, was that, hey, we can drive down interest rates by buying bonds.
[00:10:41.767 --> 00:10:43.368]  But instead, they've gone up.
[00:10:45.229 --> 00:10:56.737]  And so I would imagine, as the Fed buys up more of the bonds they're issuing to finance this year's budget deficit, the interest rates are going to go
[00:10:58.038 --> 00:10:58.659]  Rise higher.
[00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:04.704]  And so then they're faced with what do we do about the real estate crisis?
[00:11:05.985 --> 00:11:07.086]  The rates are rising.
[00:11:07.506 --> 00:11:08.667]  How does that help?
[00:11:08.787 --> 00:11:09.408]  It doesn't help.
[00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:10.048]  See what I'm saying?
[00:11:10.429 --> 00:11:10.789]  It hurts.
[00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:24.681]  And so I think they've, that's what I say, that they're creating more problems than they can manage and they will be devoured
[00:11:28.306 --> 00:11:41.509]  Dr. Paul Gregg Roberts got a break again.
[00:11:41.549 --> 00:11:43.209]  Come back and continue explaining that to people.
[00:11:43.789 --> 00:11:48.191]  Yeah, I mean, they supposedly owe all these trillions in TARP money, but now it's harder to get a mortgage.
[00:11:48.651 --> 00:11:53.832]  They're using the money to buy up other banks and insurance companies and having the government come in and order banks
[00:11:55.578 --> 00:11:56.439]  In their activities.
[00:11:57.721 --> 00:12:00.864]  We'll talk about the whole Bank of America scandal when we get back with Dr. Paul Greg Roberts.
[00:12:00.924 --> 00:12:01.565]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:12:01.865 --> 00:12:04.068]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.
[00:12:04.228 --> 00:12:13.299]  We have received news the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[00:12:13.719 --> 00:12:21.588]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line with American Tax Settlement.
[00:12:21.728 --> 00:12:27.675]  For all Alex Jones listeners to see if you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands, the number to call is 1-800.
[00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:30.898]  506-5904.
[00:12:31.118 --> 00:12:35.781]  Millions of taxpayers now may be eligible for this settlement to save thousands of dollars.
[00:12:36.181 --> 00:12:40.824]  Don't risk the IRS coming after you and garnishing your wages or seizing your property.
[00:12:41.044 --> 00:12:49.690]  American Tax Settlement specializes in negotiating with the IRS on your behalf, keeping the IRS off your back, and saving consumers millions of dollars.
[00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:57.253]  If you owe 10,000 or more in taxes to the IRS, the number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[00:12:57.473 --> 00:12:58.313]  That's 1-800-506-5904.
[00:13:00.534 --> 00:13:01.174]  Call today.
[00:13:02.194 --> 00:13:07.516]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:13:08.016 --> 00:13:15.039]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:13:15.595 --> 00:13:21.781]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:13:22.181 --> 00:13:24.023]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:13:24.143 --> 00:13:26.585]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:13:26.666 --> 00:13:37.456]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:13:38.223 --> 00:13:39.504]  It's not about left or right.
[00:13:39.885 --> 00:13:41.286]  It's about a one world government.
[00:13:41.746 --> 00:13:48.092]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:13:48.653 --> 00:13:56.460]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.081]  The Obama Deception.
[00:13:58.502 --> 00:13:59.703]  The people strike back.
[00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:02.091]  Good day.
[00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:03.873]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:14:04.013 --> 00:14:04.233]  June 12, 2009.
[00:14:04.313 --> 00:14:05.254]  Gold open this morning at $9.4710.
[00:14:05.294 --> 00:14:09.058]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.7420, $2.8710 for a half ounce, and $2.4355 for a quarter ounce.
[00:14:09.119 --> 00:14:09.619]  That's $9.7420, $4.8710, and $2.4355.
[00:14:20.706 --> 00:14:34.233]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[00:14:34.333 --> 00:14:42.917]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:14:43.177 --> 00:14:44.138]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:14:44.258 --> 00:14:48.400]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.641]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:49.701 --> 00:14:51.522]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[00:14:51.562 --> 00:14:51.782]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:14:51.802 --> 00:14:52.102]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:15:05.029 --> 00:15:05.871]  News flash!
[00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:08.718]  Unemployment is soaring over 10%.
[00:15:09.078 --> 00:15:13.108]  The dollar is plummeting and banks are beginning to close their doors.
[00:15:14.529 --> 00:15:18.472]  Financial experts are saying we are headed for an economic depression.
[00:15:18.512 --> 00:15:22.734]  The world is on the brink of total meltdown.
[00:15:23.134 --> 00:15:29.959]  Unless you expect the government to bail you out, you must be able to grow your own healthy food.
[00:15:30.139 --> 00:15:38.244]  Survivalistseeds.com has just released a brand new heirloom seed pack at a dramatically reduced price.
[00:15:38.464 --> 00:15:42.306]  So you and your family have a long-term food solution.
[00:15:44.104 --> 00:15:44.665]  We're good to go.
[00:16:18.669 --> 00:16:21.191]  I want to get back into the economy in the next segment.
[00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:22.892]  Final segment with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:16:25.974 --> 00:16:31.097]  But right now I want to shift gears and one of the other big subjects he talks about, the police state.
[00:16:31.197 --> 00:16:32.558]  And again, he's a real conservative.
[00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:42.901]  Father of Reaganomics, but we've had police shooting people in handcuffs in the back and then trying to claim they attacked them and then hidden camera stuff gets released and they just shoot the guy for no reason.
[00:16:43.842 --> 00:16:46.506]  We have police shooting people's little dogs all over the news.
[00:16:46.806 --> 00:16:51.713]  When they come to your house now and the chihuahua barks, they kill it, saying it was a threat to the officers, literally.
[00:16:53.126 --> 00:16:55.447]  And we've got the military and the police training everywhere.
[00:16:55.827 --> 00:17:11.132]  The TSA announced in the Associated Press yesterday that in Boston and New York, everyone will be searched and everyone, I don't know how they're going to do this, but it says everyone, will be put through those body scanners, you know, that are called, you know, the naked scanners in the news that show your body.
[00:17:11.532 --> 00:17:17.854]  And that the FBI wants them to set up TSA-style security at America's biggest malls.
[00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:27.134]  And your book, The Tyranny of Good Intentions, I don't think it really is even good intentions, but it tells all these amazing stories and how the Bill of Rights is being abolished.
[00:17:27.174 --> 00:17:29.415]  The second edition's out right now, brand new.
[00:17:29.455 --> 00:17:30.736]  We got it up on screen for folks.
[00:17:31.456 --> 00:17:45.904]  And in the few minutes we got left in this little short segment, I mean, it looks like it's premeditated here as they implode the economy and they've set up NORTHCOM now and they say they're going to use army troops on us, but I don't see that working as society continues to implode.
[00:17:45.924 --> 00:17:46.645]  Can you speak to that?
[00:17:49.484 --> 00:17:57.970]  I mean, first of all, this couldn't possibly have anything to do with terrorists, because they haven't bombed any subways or any shopping centers.
[00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:17.262]  And as far as we can tell, the only terrorists that have been uncovered in the United States are people that the FBI stirred up and led, and talked into doing things with promises of large sums of money.
[00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:40.867]  Since there aren't any terrorists, and the FBI has to go out and find really incompetent and somewhat unintelligent people to bribe with money to say that they want to go be a terrorist, then we're not under any attack.
[00:18:40.927 --> 00:18:47.092]  So there's no reason for any of this body scanning, other than to further
[00:18:49.508 --> 00:18:57.214]  Make the American people accept searches without warrants, because that's basically what they're doing to you.
[00:18:57.234 --> 00:18:59.496]  They're searching you without a warrant.
[00:18:59.536 --> 00:19:13.286]  Now, the claim on the air travel is that, oh, but you see, if you don't want to be searched, you don't have to fly.
[00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:19.351]  And since flying is so vulnerable, you're up in the air, and we can't
[00:19:19.986 --> 00:19:22.388]  Have anybody a danger to the other passengers?
[00:19:22.508 --> 00:19:27.091]  Well, of course, going to malls is not that kind of argument at all.
[00:19:28.392 --> 00:19:30.434]  There's nobody up in the air.
[00:19:30.454 --> 00:19:40.442]  There's no vulnerabilities other than what you would find from being mugged or hit by a car or anything else when you go out.
[00:19:41.683 --> 00:19:48.728]  And so, there's no special vulnerabilities, and so it has nothing to do with anything
[00:19:49.634 --> 00:19:54.897]  Except training us to be good little citizens of a police state.
[00:19:56.598 --> 00:20:03.923]  Oh, yes, but the next thing they will do then is say we have to have implants so they'll know where we are at all times.
[00:20:03.963 --> 00:20:05.103]  They're already proposing that.
[00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:08.606]  The Mexican Attorney General made his employees take them three years ago.
[00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:18.692]  Well, I don't know what's behind all this other than just bureaucracy running amok.
[00:20:20.037 --> 00:20:31.626]  We can look for conspiracies, but the trouble I always have with all these conspiracies is it assumes that they're so much smarter than they ever show any signs of being.
[00:20:32.127 --> 00:20:33.768]  I don't think they're even that smart.
[00:20:34.068 --> 00:20:35.889]  They have the instinct of control freaks.
[00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:40.913]  Okay, that's, they just, it's a bureaucracy that always wants more power.
[00:20:41.834 --> 00:20:42.535]  Well, of course.
[00:20:43.275 --> 00:20:49.260]  So if technology presents new opportunities, then they seize it and they
[00:20:49.969 --> 00:21:00.653]  And they use it, but... I suppose people... If the American people were clued in, which unfortunately not very many of them are, they all need to listen to your show.
[00:21:01.474 --> 00:21:07.776]  But if they were clued in, then they could just boycott the malls.
[00:21:09.417 --> 00:21:11.758]  And then the malls... And the subways and the rest of it.
[00:21:11.778 --> 00:21:12.238]  And the subways.
[00:21:12.398 --> 00:21:19.261]  You don't have to use... Subways is kind of harder, I guess, for New Yorkers, because they've got to be able to get around a city that's
[00:21:20.342 --> 00:21:23.672]  But you could certainly boycott the malls.
[00:21:25.089 --> 00:21:31.853]  And then that would contribute to the commercial real estate collapse and people would probably make the government back off.
[00:21:32.373 --> 00:21:34.014]  Well, as you know, sir, they've done studies.
[00:21:34.054 --> 00:21:39.257]  A lot of people don't fly now because they don't like having the illegal aliens that run security jab them and scream at them.
[00:21:39.538 --> 00:21:50.004]  I want to ask you about the MIAC and DHS reports we broke a few months ago, listing conservatives and people as terrorists and the whole in the Fed movement, where you see that going with auditing the Fed.
[00:21:50.504 --> 00:21:51.204]  Stay with us, sir.
[00:21:51.505 --> 00:21:52.045]  Final segment.
[00:21:52.245 --> 00:21:55.236]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:21:56.179 --> 00:21:58.888]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:23:01.665 --> 00:23:10.327]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[00:23:10.767 --> 00:23:15.468]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[00:23:15.928 --> 00:23:18.509]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[00:23:18.929 --> 00:23:20.550]  Actually results in disease.

[00:24:01.513 --> 00:24:07.056]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[00:24:07.376 --> 00:24:08.517]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:24:08.677 --> 00:24:11.438]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around.
[00:24:11.658 --> 00:24:12.639]  Called InnerFood.
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.502]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[00:24:14.802 --> 00:24:21.109]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[00:24:22.251 --> 00:24:24.814]  InnerFood is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[00:24:25.114 --> 00:24:26.536]  No fillers, no sweeteners.

[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.123]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[00:24:34.383 --> 00:24:40.268]  Try the NutriCafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[00:24:40.649 --> 00:24:42.851]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[00:24:43.071 --> 00:24:45.333]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[00:24:45.533 --> 00:24:47.295]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[00:24:47.635 --> 00:24:49.997]  Go to www.nutricafe.com.
[00:24:50.137 --> 00:24:52.978]  Well, yeah, it's fine If you've got the time
[00:25:20.521 --> 00:25:21.288]  I'm in a tent
[00:25:31.427 --> 00:25:35.288]  You know, we broke the MIAC report, the DHS report, and many others before that.
[00:25:35.328 --> 00:25:37.768]  We broke previous reports put out in the feds.
[00:25:37.788 --> 00:25:38.849]  People wouldn't believe us.
[00:25:39.609 --> 00:25:48.951]  We broke that they had InfraGard here before it was in the mainstream news, getting 56,000 executives with shoot-to-kill orders during martial law ready to watch their employees.
[00:25:49.671 --> 00:25:50.471]  Now it's public.
[00:25:50.771 --> 00:25:52.032]  The clergy response teams
[00:25:53.773 --> 00:25:57.435]  Now, over 40,000 of those we know of.
[00:25:57.855 --> 00:26:05.361]  Then it came on the news years after we had the secret documents saying, oh yes, the clergy's preparing their flocks to hand in their guns, go to FEMA camps.
[00:26:05.741 --> 00:26:06.702]  That's mainstream news.
[00:26:06.722 --> 00:26:07.722]  You can't make this up.
[00:26:08.223 --> 00:26:09.443]  I can't believe it myself.
[00:26:09.904 --> 00:26:10.684]  It's so crazy.
[00:26:11.385 --> 00:26:15.868]  And then now the DHS report comes out and says Ron Paul supporters, people that want to audit the Fed.
[00:26:17.649 --> 00:26:34.269]  We got the documents from the Army, leaked to us, and the Army admitted to the news that they were spying on Ron Paul in Houston and me in Dallas protesting the Fed last year and listed us as potential terrorists and told the military in plain clothes, Army intelligence, don't let them know you're military, they may kill you.
[00:26:34.589 --> 00:26:36.291]  That's posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:26:36.852 --> 00:26:41.816]  I mean, this country's just got secret police all over it, and now they want to have secret arrests.
[00:26:41.856 --> 00:26:49.222]  They've said no more Bill of Rights, basically no more Fourth Amendment, warrantless wiretappings, A-OK, the courts have ruled, the Congress has passed a law.
[00:26:50.163 --> 00:26:55.908]  And then Dr. Roberts, I mean, you've been saying for years here on the air that they're gearing up to make the American people the enemy.
[00:26:56.548 --> 00:27:00.531]  Now they say in the DHS report the number one potential threat is veterans?
[00:27:01.801 --> 00:27:04.163]  And gun owners and Ron Paul supporters.
[00:27:04.943 --> 00:27:05.884]  Give me your take.
[00:27:06.144 --> 00:27:07.425]  Yeah, and Bob Barr supporters.
[00:27:07.845 --> 00:27:08.426]  And Bob Barr.
[00:27:08.446 --> 00:27:09.286]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:27:09.306 --> 00:27:10.047]  Your take on that?
[00:27:11.087 --> 00:27:17.452]  Well, I think, you know, it shows the brown shirt mentality that I've been writing about for several years.
[00:27:18.272 --> 00:27:31.461]  It shows how they've taken patriotism of people who are not particularly bright and turned it into a brown shirt mentality where they're prepared now to turn on anyone who can be demonized.
[00:27:32.691 --> 00:27:39.693]  And so, the government is obviously going to demonize people who are associated with the defense of civil liberties.
[00:27:41.293 --> 00:27:43.154]  And that's who's being demonized.
[00:27:43.254 --> 00:27:45.714]  I mean, now you have Bob Barr and Ron Paul.
[00:27:46.795 --> 00:27:58.218]  And so, and it'll be the ACLU, and it'll be libertarians in general, and anybody who says,
[00:27:59.798 --> 00:28:08.985]  We have these rights and it's illegal under statutory law and also unconstitutional for you and the government to violate these rights.
[00:28:09.765 --> 00:28:11.987]  That is the enemy now.
[00:28:12.007 --> 00:28:24.316]  So anyone who is opposed to unbridled state arbitrary power is an enemy of America.
[00:28:24.356 --> 00:28:28.679]  They will soon be called terrorists or
[00:28:29.645 --> 00:28:32.506]  Or insurgents or something.
[00:28:33.026 --> 00:28:34.587]  And so that's what's happening.
[00:28:34.847 --> 00:28:36.307]  You're right to call attention to it.
[00:28:37.108 --> 00:28:39.008]  And that's exactly what's happened.
[00:28:39.528 --> 00:28:45.691]  The Founding Fathers would all be arrested as dangers to state power.
[00:28:46.631 --> 00:28:49.792]  So I think that's what we are faced with.
[00:28:49.932 --> 00:28:58.215]  And one check to it, of course, is an armed population, if they're prepared to use the
[00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:07.213]  But of course the kind of guns we have are not very powerful compared to what the state can wield.
[00:29:08.093 --> 00:29:28.378]  And the other check to this development that we're discussing, I call it the Brown Shirt Movement, is that the government overreaches, which we talked about earlier, and finds its power shaken, suffers some big defeats and humiliations, and that this breaks the whole.
[00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:34.313]  That it's acquiring over people's minds and bodies.
[00:29:34.513 --> 00:29:46.802]  So, other than that, I don't think there's going to be any kind of a political movement or reformers in Washington that are going to be able to roll this back.
[00:29:46.862 --> 00:29:48.584]  The courts might slow them down.
[00:29:50.465 --> 00:29:58.691]  There are still enough people on the federal bench that weren't put there by the Federalist Society who
[00:29:59.437 --> 00:30:07.779]  Who still believe in a balance of powers and civil liberties, and the courts may slow this process down.
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:20.903]  And let's hope they do, because the more it's slowed down, the more likely the power of the federal government is going to crack from its hubris and arrogance and overextension.
[00:30:21.583 --> 00:30:26.605]  I don't think the entire world is prepared to put up with the United States.
[00:30:27.742 --> 00:30:27.882]  I think?
[00:30:58.444 --> 00:30:58.864]  We're good to go.
[00:31:28.488 --> 00:31:33.472]  Uh, imprison us all in some way or the other by... So how long are they going to put up with it?
[00:31:34.653 --> 00:31:35.354]  You mean the foreigners?
[00:31:36.109 --> 00:31:43.115]  Well, I mean, here, how long can the corruption just burgeon and spill out like a plague of locusts eating our flesh to the bone?
[00:31:43.175 --> 00:31:56.345]  I mean, how long can the arrogance and the hubris and the just open tyranny and open torture and open secret arrest and open wars and open lies, I mean, how long can evil be called good and good called evil?
[00:31:57.046 --> 00:31:58.527]  How long will the world put up with this?
[00:31:58.567 --> 00:32:00.568]  Where do you see this developing into now?
[00:32:01.689 --> 00:32:03.831]  Well, I think that if it's
[00:32:04.691 --> 00:32:10.095]  That the American people are unlikely to call a halt to it.
[00:32:11.035 --> 00:32:14.577]  If the halt is called, it'll be from foreigners.
[00:32:14.838 --> 00:32:20.261]  Our so-called NATO puppet states will cease to be puppet states.
[00:32:20.341 --> 00:32:22.222]  They won't want the association.
[00:32:24.524 --> 00:32:28.006]  The Russians and Chinese are already digging in their heels.
[00:32:30.476 --> 00:32:36.680]  At some point, the instability that we cause in the Middle East will threaten our puppets there.
[00:32:38.061 --> 00:32:43.325]  And to save themselves, they may simply switch over.
[00:32:44.046 --> 00:32:53.753]  I don't think the United States has the power required for its aggressive program of hegemony at home and abroad.
[00:32:56.074 --> 00:32:57.235]  I just don't think it does.
[00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:02.412]  It does, but I do agree with you that that's their intention.
[00:33:02.432 --> 00:33:05.894]  Their intention is to tyrannize us and the rest of the world.
[00:33:08.376 --> 00:33:20.784]  But I don't think, and I of course may be wrong, that they have the financial and moral and leadership and military power to achieve that.
[00:33:20.804 --> 00:33:27.928]  And when you think about them occupying the United States when they can occupy Baghdad,
[00:33:29.485 --> 00:33:33.608]  Dr. Roberts, you were in Washington, you were in the White House, you were at the highest levels of government.
[00:33:34.169 --> 00:33:53.804]  When I watch Glenn Beck posing as one of us, but saying, arrest Ron Paul supporters, use the army on us, that this horrible Bruner guy, or whatever his name is at the Jewish Center, that he's a Ron Paul supporter, and he has CIA guys on, saying that militia people work with Al Qaeda.
[00:33:54.966 --> 00:33:55.907]  They know they're lying.
[00:33:55.947 --> 00:33:56.928]  They know it's bull.
[00:33:58.009 --> 00:33:58.950]  And you look in their eyes.
[00:33:59.050 --> 00:33:59.931]  Beck's enjoying it.
[00:33:59.971 --> 00:34:02.915]  The CIA guy looked like he was losing his soul while he was doing it.
[00:34:02.955 --> 00:34:09.102]  But, I mean, how do they get CIA guys to really try to terrorize the U.S.?
[00:34:09.542 --> 00:34:11.905]  I guess they just work for offshore corporate interests and that's their job.
[00:34:11.945 --> 00:34:14.207]  I want you to comment on that in closing.
[00:34:14.227 --> 00:34:15.229]  And then one other point.
[00:34:15.689 --> 00:34:16.789]  Alright, I'll say two things briefly.
[00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:18.930]  One, having been in the Reagan administration,
[00:34:38.982 --> 00:34:47.868]  I don't think anybody there, certainly not Reagan, none of us, could possibly have conceived of where the United States would be a quarter of a century later.
[00:34:48.768 --> 00:34:54.312]  This type of behavior, I don't think we could even have conceived of it.
[00:34:54.412 --> 00:34:58.934]  We would have thought it was some kind of science fiction film or something.
[00:35:01.316 --> 00:35:04.638]  I never saw any of those kinds of intentions.
[00:35:04.698 --> 00:35:06.239]  It wasn't anything that
[00:35:06.698 --> 00:35:15.763]  If anybody was concerned with it, it was going on, it certainly wasn't anything that ever reached my ears or awareness.
[00:35:16.504 --> 00:35:22.047]  And I don't think it had anything whatsoever to do with Reagan or his intentions or what he was trying to do.
[00:35:22.147 --> 00:35:33.714]  So there's been that big of a flip-flop and change in Washington culture, it's just... In a quarter of a century, something has happened that none of us could have even dreamed of.
[00:35:34.249 --> 00:35:38.371]  Now, the question on auditing the Fed, it must be audited.
[00:35:38.911 --> 00:35:46.854]  The Fed doesn't want to be audited because they're allowed to use their profits for their own expenses.
[00:35:47.874 --> 00:35:51.096]  And then whatever's left, they are supposed to turn into the Treasury.
[00:35:52.336 --> 00:35:55.617]  So they probably don't want anyone to learn about their expenses.
[00:35:57.298 --> 00:36:00.059]  They probably live a grand life, you know, they have that
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:14.105]  Uh, plays up in Jackson Hole where they go every year for their conferences and it's just, you know, it's a grand life and they probably don't want anybody to see the expenses.
[00:36:14.145 --> 00:36:26.669]  Now, of course, there may be other reasons they don't want to be audited, but I don't think a democracy or any kind of government can afford to have elements of it that aren't audited.
[00:36:28.146 --> 00:36:40.769]  Now, when the General Accounting Office has tried to audit various parts of the United States government, such as the Pentagon or any cabinet level agency, they've often said that the information is so bad we can't do an audit.
[00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:52.672]  And so what we have is a situation where the United States government puts private firms in prison for having bad accounting practices, but itself has no accounting practices that could even be audited.
[00:36:54.105 --> 00:36:54.585]  Exactly.
[00:36:54.605 --> 00:37:04.008]  Well, the Pentagon, in hearings four years ago, said they had two plus trillion missing, and I've got Rumsfeld on video saying, I don't know where it is and we're not going to ever tell you.
[00:37:04.488 --> 00:37:09.370]  And he brings up Dr. Chu, the head of financing, and he says, we're not going to tell you.
[00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:13.811]  It's just like Bernanke to Senator Sanders going, I'm not going to tell you where the money went.
[00:37:15.132 --> 00:37:15.992]  That's right.
[00:37:16.132 --> 00:37:19.773]  If they know, they're not going to tell you, and they may not know, or they may only know in part.
[00:37:20.733 --> 00:37:22.914]  And they use a lot of it to buy foreign governments.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.881]  You know, I've said this before, when I was, my Ph.D.
[00:37:27.381 --> 00:37:33.502]  dissertation chairman was the second most powerful man in the Pentagon during the Nixon years, and he invited me to his office once.
[00:37:33.542 --> 00:37:37.043]  He wanted me to do something for the government.
[00:37:39.383 --> 00:37:45.985]  And I asked him, I said, how did the United States get all these foreign countries to do what they want all the time?
[00:37:46.025 --> 00:37:46.945]  How'd they get them to do it?
[00:37:46.985 --> 00:37:47.605]  He said, money.
[00:37:48.317 --> 00:37:48.737]  I don't know.
[00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:10.353]  Let me ask you this question then.
[00:38:10.674 --> 00:38:23.117]  What is going to happen that when the dollar finally dies or finally falls apart, or is no longer completely a monopolar system, for a season, a few years, they'll still be the big military?
[00:38:23.137 --> 00:38:25.278]  We'll be the ones to pay it.
[00:38:26.358 --> 00:38:27.299]  Well, I understand, but...
[00:38:29.764 --> 00:38:36.929]  So will they use the military right when it implodes, as the Rand Corporation says they may, to start World War III as a cover, or will it just implode?
[00:38:37.249 --> 00:38:37.669]  I don't know.
[00:38:37.729 --> 00:38:40.111]  I think it'll just implode, because there's no money.
[00:38:40.131 --> 00:38:44.794]  See, we're import dependent, and we can't pay for the imports.
[00:38:44.814 --> 00:38:46.195]  We can't feed people, clothe them.
[00:38:46.235 --> 00:38:47.256]  There's no gasoline.
[00:38:47.636 --> 00:38:48.717]  You can't make deliveries.
[00:38:49.257 --> 00:38:50.938]  And they won't be able to buy off these governments.
[00:38:50.958 --> 00:38:52.299]  Well, I mean, even if we lose the World Reserve.
[00:38:52.319 --> 00:38:52.840]  That's the main point.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:53.840]  That's the main point.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.061]  See, this happened to the Romans.
[00:38:55.081 --> 00:38:59.124]  You know, when the silver denarius, the main monetary unit,
[00:38:59.778 --> 00:39:03.040]  It got so inflated that it was nothing but lead.
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.081]  It turned essentially into lead.
[00:39:05.101 --> 00:39:06.542]  The silver coin became lead.
[00:39:06.923 --> 00:39:08.524]  They couldn't buy off the barbarians.
[00:39:08.544 --> 00:39:09.564]  They didn't want the damn lead.
[00:39:13.247 --> 00:39:14.527]  It's the same thing again.
[00:39:14.628 --> 00:39:21.172]  So our paper is being destroyed by overprinting or whatever, overcreation.
[00:39:22.232 --> 00:39:29.257]  And when the thing goes, and the Chinese keep pointing that it's going to go, it's going to go, they're worried.
[00:39:30.043 --> 00:39:31.443]  Because they're holding a trillion dollars.
[00:39:32.164 --> 00:39:36.465]  And when it goes, you can't buy people anymore, you can't buy them.
[00:39:36.725 --> 00:39:38.386]  When it goes, how fast will it go?
[00:39:39.546 --> 00:39:47.889]  I think if it starts, it'll be very fast because everybody, the stocks that the world holds of dollars are immense.
[00:39:48.229 --> 00:39:53.671]  You know, there's a trillion in Japan, a trillion in China, who knows how much OPEC has, probably another trillion.
[00:39:54.346 --> 00:39:54.566]  I think so.
[00:40:07.448 --> 00:40:12.810]  And so, they're not going to all sit there and say, oh, we can't panic because we'll drive the price down.
[00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:14.630]  Have you ever seen that happen in the stock market?
[00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.211]  No.
[00:40:15.371 --> 00:40:15.551]  No.
[00:40:15.731 --> 00:40:17.191]  Well, it ain't going to happen with a dollar.
[00:40:17.211 --> 00:40:25.354]  And all those idiots, those financial gurus, who say, oh, the Chinese will no do blah blah, they'll lose dollars.
[00:40:25.394 --> 00:40:26.214]  They'll value the dollars.
[00:40:26.234 --> 00:40:27.754]  Well, why don't they say that about stocks?
[00:40:29.415 --> 00:40:30.735]  Well, they don't know what they're talking about.
[00:40:30.775 --> 00:40:31.836]  They're just spinning.
[00:40:32.916 --> 00:40:36.057]  You know, everything you hear is a lie, just like you say.
[00:40:36.826 --> 00:40:51.915]  Well, in closing, it was not barbarians that laughed at Geithner when he told them everything was going to be just dandy and that they could have their money rise and that their dollar investments wouldn't fall, which is ridiculous.
[00:40:52.255 --> 00:41:00.320]  Obviously, keeping their yawn low has helped keep the dollars high so they can keep selling their goods, for those that don't understand that basic equation.
[00:41:01.161 --> 00:41:03.182]  But in our final equation here,
[00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:10.692]  This is just like with the Romans in 300, 350, 410 when Alaric sat Rome.
[00:41:10.712 --> 00:41:11.213]  You're right.
[00:41:12.333 --> 00:41:19.536]  The barbarians began laughing when they said we'll give you lead as money and they knew real value and it looks like that's starting to happen.
[00:41:19.556 --> 00:41:23.258]  You know, like the Chinese were laughing at Geithner offering him lead.
[00:41:23.278 --> 00:41:27.180]  I think that's a good analogy, Alex.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.220]  You summed it up.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.141]  The Chinese don't want our lead.
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:39.665]  Alright, well what, a lot of smart money, people that I've seen me write in the past are saying they think things are really going to, fireworks in October, or who knows?
[00:41:40.305 --> 00:41:45.208]  Alex, just keep in mind, it wasn't that long ago that gold was $35 an ounce.
[00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:48.570]  What is it today?
[00:41:51.132 --> 00:41:48.570]  $970.
[00:41:51.712 --> 00:41:54.714]  What are people predicting in the next year?
[00:41:56.223 --> 00:41:57.103]  Two thousand, yeah.
[00:41:57.263 --> 00:42:08.527]  Alright, now, from 1971, when it was still $35 an ounce, to today, has been the superpower time of the United States.
[00:42:09.328 --> 00:42:10.328]  We've been the superpower.
[00:42:10.688 --> 00:42:11.388]  We've prevailed.
[00:42:11.568 --> 00:42:12.829]  The Soviet Union's gone.
[00:42:13.249 --> 00:42:14.810]  We've had our way with the world.
[00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:23.473]  So, during the period of our greatest power, the dollar relationship from gold has changed from $35 an ounce to $1,000 an ounce.
[00:42:26.467 --> 00:42:32.745]  If you can have that kind of collapse during your prime, what can you have during your fall?
[00:42:33.874 --> 00:42:37.497]  It'll all accelerate the tyranny of good intentions.
[00:42:37.557 --> 00:42:38.557]  Second edition out.
[00:42:38.918 --> 00:42:40.659]  Just Google Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:42:40.679 --> 00:42:41.559]  Read all his great columns.
[00:42:41.599 --> 00:42:44.862]  We link to him over at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:42:45.182 --> 00:42:47.223]  Dr. Roberts, always informative, having you on.
[00:42:47.243 --> 00:42:48.584]  Thank you for spending so much time with us.
[00:42:48.805 --> 00:42:49.565]  Have a great weekend.
[00:42:49.725 --> 00:42:50.686]  I enjoy being with you.
[00:42:50.726 --> 00:42:50.926]  Thank you.
[00:42:51.446 --> 00:42:51.907]  God bless you.
[00:42:51.927 --> 00:42:52.227]  Take care.
[00:42:52.247 --> 00:42:52.627]  There he goes.
[00:42:52.907 --> 00:42:54.288]  I'm gonna come back, hit some more news.
[00:42:54.609 --> 00:42:57.711]  And Daniel Sanjata, star of Rescue Me and a lot more is coming up.
[00:42:57.971 --> 00:42:59.052]  Talk about 9-11 truth.
[00:42:59.532 --> 00:43:00.112]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:43:00.132 --> 00:43:00.473]  Stay with us.
[00:43:03.391 --> 00:43:04.252]  Spring is here.
[00:43:04.512 --> 00:43:05.292]  Growing season.
[00:43:05.473 --> 00:43:07.454]  The economy is not getting any better.
[00:43:07.674 --> 00:43:09.075]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[00:43:09.375 --> 00:43:10.036]  Think about it.
[00:43:10.356 --> 00:43:14.199]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[00:43:14.439 --> 00:43:17.922]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[00:43:18.142 --> 00:43:20.704]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[00:43:20.964 --> 00:43:32.212]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family
[00:43:32.312 --> 00:43:32.612]  Let's do it!
[00:44:01.718 --> 00:44:03.059]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:44:03.219 --> 00:44:08.204]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[00:44:08.605 --> 00:44:10.687]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.

[00:44:20.496 --> 00:44:27.261]  This program has already settled over 100 million dollars of debt and are saving individual consumers thousands of dollars.
[00:44:27.581 --> 00:44:33.725]  Folks, if you are struggling with credit card debt and those excessive interest payments, the time is now to take advantage of this opportunity.
[00:44:33.905 --> 00:44:37.968]  Call the bailout group today at 1-800-324-6554.
[00:44:38.168 --> 00:44:40.389]  I hope our listeners take advantage of this.
[00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:45.993]  The call is free and in 10 minutes they will show you how much you can save right over the phone with one simple call.
[00:44:46.233 --> 00:44:48.395]  Let the bailout group bail you out of debt.
[00:44:48.615 --> 00:44:50.056]  Reduce your payments by up to 60%
[00:44:50.336 --> 00:44:50.716]  We're good.
[00:45:01.929 --> 00:45:03.790]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:09.114]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:45:09.274 --> 00:45:10.615]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:45:10.895 --> 00:45:19.061]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:45:19.281 --> 00:45:25.005]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:45:25.445 --> 00:45:26.967]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:45:27.027 --> 00:45:29.189]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:45:29.209 --> 00:45:33.573]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:45:33.754 --> 00:45:35.876]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:45:35.976 --> 00:45:44.084]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:45:44.144 --> 00:45:44.545]  We're good.
[00:46:26.417 --> 00:46:29.659]  Some of the new bumper music I've been adding.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.620]  Oh, who's likes that?
[00:46:36.602 --> 00:46:39.403]  I can do the, uh, happy dance right now for everybody.
[00:46:40.344 --> 00:46:48.227]  It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from going under.
[00:46:48.427 --> 00:46:52.929]  It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from going under.
[00:46:59.966 --> 00:47:06.752]  You know, I've always had a pretty good attitude, but things have gotten really stressful as we get more and more attention and, you know, fighting the New World Order.
[00:47:06.812 --> 00:47:12.557]  But I've just learned to trust in God and make sure I get my exercise every day, and that really boosts me and gets me positive.
[00:47:12.938 --> 00:47:15.600]  I'll tell you what else makes me really positive, and I'm going to cover all this news.
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.282]  Daniel Shinjata coming up and a lot more.
[00:47:19.585 --> 00:47:20.026]  I'll tell you.
[00:47:20.046 --> 00:47:22.469]  I'm going to play this Keith Oberman.
[00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:29.279]  Oberman now, and I respect him for reporting on Dick Cheney trying to stage terror attacks after New Yorker Magazine confirmed it.
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:31.302]  We already warned of that months before.
[00:47:31.342 --> 00:47:32.423]  We had intel from the Navy.
[00:47:32.443 --> 00:47:34.606]  That's why Fox Fallon, the Admiral, quit.
[00:47:34.967 --> 00:47:35.668]  Had a sent come.
[00:47:38.353 --> 00:47:46.098]  I mean, now, Oberman's trying to tie Ron Paul in with the horrible attacker of the Jewish Center.
[00:47:46.178 --> 00:47:48.400]  I mean, it's just, they're desperate folks.
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:52.602]  The Federal Reserve needs to do this, and it creates anti-Semitism.
[00:47:52.662 --> 00:47:57.806]  Most people talking about the Federal Reserve and the bankers and Bank of America and corruption, they're not thinking Jews.
[00:48:00.253 --> 00:48:03.756]  And the media makes it about Jews and actually creates the anti-semitism.
[00:48:04.036 --> 00:48:05.397]  That's what multiculturalism is.
[00:48:05.437 --> 00:48:07.058]  They make everything a racial issue.
[00:48:07.358 --> 00:48:08.479]  Everything a religious issue.
[00:48:08.519 --> 00:48:10.440]  Everything getting each other in our throats.
[00:48:12.182 --> 00:48:14.303]  Because there happens to be some Jews in banking.
[00:48:17.185 --> 00:48:18.707]  You know, there's some Chinese people in there too.
[00:48:18.727 --> 00:48:19.787]  We don't say it's a China, you know.
[00:48:20.007 --> 00:48:23.270]  The media is injecting this into the debate.
[00:48:25.256 --> 00:48:29.080]  So we'll talk about that a lot more coming up and a host of other issues dealing with 9-11 truth.
[00:48:30.181 --> 00:48:36.567]  But I do have to tell you folks that we have reached $240,000 and some change.
[00:48:37.328 --> 00:48:43.614]  And so if you go to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or InfoWars.com and link through to it, you can see that's happening.
[00:48:43.634 --> 00:48:45.436]  And hey, I say let's run it through the weekend.
[00:48:45.976 --> 00:48:47.357]  Let's break last year's record.
[00:48:48.268 --> 00:48:50.009]  Plus, we have that big donation from Daryl Rundis.
[00:48:50.029 --> 00:48:53.692]  We want to push this way past that so it really does break last year's record.
[00:48:53.712 --> 00:48:56.014]  You can also call, I haven't given this number out today.
[00:48:56.274 --> 00:48:58.275]  This is our one time a year for a couple days.
[00:48:58.315 --> 00:49:05.180]  We do the InfoWorks Money Bomb second annual to expand what we're doing, put out more films, buy more equipment, get more reporters.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:10.384]  Thank you for all your support, buying the books and videos and PrisonPlanet.tv memberships and supporting our sponsors.
[00:49:10.444 --> 00:49:11.304]  I salute all of you.
[00:49:12.287 --> 00:49:17.709]  You can call toll free 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[00:49:18.009 --> 00:49:21.731]  Think of all the guests and all the activists and all the groups that we bring on here.
[00:49:21.991 --> 00:49:23.712]  Think of the platform we give to people.
[00:49:23.932 --> 00:49:27.373]  Think of how we're helping network and expand everything.
[00:49:27.413 --> 00:49:28.134]  It's so exciting.
[00:49:30.434 --> 00:49:35.336]  But I do want to thank all of you that have given in the 2009 money bomb.
[00:49:35.557 --> 00:49:37.777]  It's clear we're going to make our goal of $250,000.
[00:49:39.518 --> 00:49:40.979]  But let's go above and beyond that.
[00:49:42.009 --> 00:49:46.692]  And 100% of the money bomb will be allocated directly to expanding this facility.
[00:49:47.152 --> 00:49:49.473]  Expanding, paying to put the TV show on air.
[00:49:49.493 --> 00:49:51.554]  We're going to have to pay for it on Dish Network and DirecTV.
[00:49:51.895 --> 00:49:53.315]  And boy, they're not friendly when we call them.
[00:49:53.335 --> 00:49:53.996]  They know who we are.
[00:49:54.516 --> 00:49:55.877]  But we're going to try to get through that barrier.
[00:49:56.817 --> 00:50:01.160]  Last year we moved over here, built these studios, expanded, got the operation running.
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.702]  While we were doing all our other jobs at the same time.
[00:50:03.722 --> 00:50:04.983]  I'm really proud of my team.
[00:50:05.403 --> 00:50:06.744]  We're going to go forward to the next level now.
[00:50:07.325 --> 00:50:09.927]  Signing the lease for the building next door to us today.
[00:50:10.367 --> 00:50:12.929]  To really kick it up a notch into another gear.
[00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:17.093]  In the face of the depression and the recession and all the problems, we are not retreating.
[00:50:17.393 --> 00:50:20.256]  We are advancing against the globalists and having great effects.
[00:50:20.716 --> 00:50:26.181]  And all of us should be savoring the fact that the private Federal Reserve is now on the defensive instead of all this arrogance.
[00:50:26.821 --> 00:50:27.722]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:27.762 --> 00:50:29.083]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:51.704 --> 00:50:56.667]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:51:22.044 --> 00:51:22.384]  We're good.
[00:51:54.565 --> 00:51:56.470]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:56.951 --> 00:51:59.698]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:12.961 --> 00:52:21.767]  Well, for the next 30 minutes, Daniel Sonjata is our guest, and he's a prominent 9-11 truther.
[00:52:22.027 --> 00:52:25.270]  A very gentlemanly, intelligent, great soul.
[00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:26.671]  Old soul, as they say.
[00:52:27.431 --> 00:52:30.233]  And, uh, that's the best way of describing him.
[00:52:30.473 --> 00:52:41.041]  And he came out to the demonstration when I got arrested a few years ago, right before 9-11, protesting the cover-up of the fact that that was an inside job there at Fox Studios.
[00:52:42.683 --> 00:52:47.527]  And he is also in the new New World Order film that came out on IFC.
[00:52:47.567 --> 00:52:50.169]  He was caught on tape there with us when I was being arrested.
[00:52:50.629 --> 00:52:54.011]  And of course he's the star of Rescue Me, a lot of other movies and TV shows.
[00:52:54.312 --> 00:53:01.317]  He had a lot of courage to go public and risk his whole Hollywood slash TV career doing what he did, just like Charlie Sheen and others did.
[00:53:02.197 --> 00:53:08.140]  And then even to fight to even have the show cover the topic, and I think they did it in a pretty fair fashion.
[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:11.841]  Obviously, it couldn't just be our side, you know, for it to be mainstream TV.
[00:53:12.241 --> 00:53:15.983]  But I'm just so proud of what he's done, and he's a great asset to humanity and liberty.
[00:53:16.423 --> 00:53:20.525]  On top of that, it's great to have him on now.
[00:53:20.665 --> 00:53:26.467]  We set him up like a couple days ago, before this horrible guy went in and shot this poor security guard, supposedly.
[00:53:26.807 --> 00:53:30.689]  It looks like a black op to me, at this Holocaust Memorial Museum.
[00:53:32.162 --> 00:53:34.944]  Perfect timing when we're trying to audit the Fed for that to happen.
[00:53:36.265 --> 00:53:37.987]  And now they're trying to demonize Ron Paul.
[00:53:38.007 --> 00:53:42.510]  They're trying to demonize 9-11 truthers, saying this guy was a hero to them with no proof.
[00:53:42.851 --> 00:53:43.892]  Glenn Beck just says that.
[00:53:43.932 --> 00:53:45.753]  So we'll talk about it all in the next 30 minutes.
[00:53:46.013 --> 00:53:48.195]  Daniel Sanjata, it's great to have you here with us.
[00:53:48.435 --> 00:53:49.276]  Oh, as always, Alex.
[00:53:49.296 --> 00:53:50.277]  It's great to be with you.
[00:53:50.297 --> 00:53:51.498]  Thank you so much for having me, man.
[00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:52.661]  Thanks for spending time.
[00:53:52.681 --> 00:53:56.904]  We've got a few minutes before the break and a long segment coming up, but first off, tell me about Rescue Me.
[00:53:56.924 --> 00:53:59.385]  You really couldn't come on the air when that was all building up.
[00:53:59.405 --> 00:54:02.668]  You wanted to just let those programs air.
[00:54:02.708 --> 00:54:04.369]  It got a lot of international attention.
[00:54:04.709 --> 00:54:06.411]  You made some great points in the Rescue Me.
[00:54:06.431 --> 00:54:07.912]  We're going to play a clip of that coming up.
[00:54:09.053 --> 00:54:14.837]  Tell me about the process of getting that on the TV show and behind the scenes, and then what happened on air.
[00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:18.332]  Well, the process was just, you know, talking about it a lot on set.
[00:54:18.452 --> 00:54:32.100]  You know, I think that eventually, although Peter, Dennis, FX, Sony, I don't think that any of them are signing on to my perspective necessarily, but I think that they saw that there was some dramatic mileage that could be gotten out of it.
[00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:36.783]  I think that they saw the no-brainer that if there was a platform on mainstream television,
[00:54:37.567 --> 00:54:47.671]  Uh, on which to address the subject that 9-11 was the appropriate venue, or rather that rescuing it was the appropriate venue, being that it's based on post-9-11 New York City firefighters.
[00:54:48.391 --> 00:54:53.573]  So, you know, in the final analysis, I was very happy with the way that they treated the subject in general.
[00:54:53.713 --> 00:54:57.255]  I mean, it came out better than I thought, you know, than I had hoped.
[00:54:57.955 --> 00:55:03.937]  I guess I had wished also that there had been a little bit more of a reaction, either positive or negative.
[00:55:03.957 --> 00:55:05.198]  It just kind of seemed like it erred.
[00:55:05.925 --> 00:55:11.973]  Not that much was said about it other than the hit piece that came out on Fox & Friends with Greg Gutfield shooting his mouth off.
[00:55:12.634 --> 00:55:17.580]  But yeah, there just wasn't as much of a reaction in general as I was kind of hoping that it would provoke.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.462]  I was hoping it would stimulate some conversation.
[00:55:20.643 --> 00:55:21.124]  Absolutely true.
[00:55:21.144 --> 00:55:22.124]  Yes, absolutely true.
[00:55:37.455 --> 00:55:39.376]  You know, I mean, at least it aired.
[00:55:39.716 --> 00:55:47.000]  I don't think that it could only have been good in terms of, you know, I'll tell you, I'm sorry, I'm jumping around, but I'll tell you what my favorite scene was.
[00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:54.364]  It was really great to be able to do those monologues where I got to, you know, list, you know, you know, let's say our side of the case.
[00:55:54.944 --> 00:56:03.629]  But my favorite 9-11 scene that they aired in Rescue Me was where Michael Lombardi's character, the probie, he and I are walking down the street and he's just telling me where his
[00:56:04.201 --> 00:56:08.165]  Need your emotional resistance to the idea kind of came from.
[00:56:08.545 --> 00:56:15.972]  You know, he was saying, you know, if you're telling me that, you know, that the bad guys are here in our own government, it's just kind of like too much for me to process.
[00:56:16.013 --> 00:56:25.722]  He was basically giving a voice to the cognitive dissonance that's responsible for a lot of people just dismissing the possibility that 9-11 could have been an inside job without ever even looking at the evidence.
[00:56:25.882 --> 00:56:27.544]  And so I really appreciated that.
[00:56:29.671 --> 00:56:34.297]  Absolutely later, we'll play one of those clips here on air with Daniel Sinjada.
[00:56:34.997 --> 00:56:37.340]  Daniel, again, I don't...
[00:56:38.123 --> 00:56:41.845]  I'm not saying this because I'm trying to butter Daniel up.
[00:56:42.206 --> 00:56:43.607]  He really needs to be honored.
[00:56:44.087 --> 00:56:51.612]  You know, somebody who's got a great career, really breaking out, and he does something that they try to blackball you for, that is the ultimate courage.
[00:56:51.952 --> 00:56:58.296]  They say, psychologically, it's easier to charge a machine gun nest to do something that is seen as socially unpopular.
[00:56:58.756 --> 00:57:00.758]  But it's only socially unpopular with the elite.
[00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:03.401]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:57:03.501 --> 00:57:08.123]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:57:08.243 --> 00:57:11.004]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:57:11.204 --> 00:57:14.065]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:57:14.245 --> 00:57:18.967]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:57:19.187 --> 00:57:20.128]  If you simply prepare.
[00:57:20.328 --> 00:57:23.270]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:30.454]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[00:59:02.483 --> 00:59:05.967]  Going into battle, you would want all the ammunition for your gun you could get.
[00:59:06.168 --> 00:59:09.391]  But presently, ammunition and reloading supplies are in shortage.
[00:59:09.692 --> 00:59:10.593]  Now think about this.
[00:59:11.053 --> 00:59:16.920]  If you have no food, all the guns and ammunition will be useless against the population control breadlines.
[00:59:17.261 --> 00:59:20.365]  In the present battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones,
[00:59:23.114 --> 00:59:23.975]  True ammunition.
[00:59:24.195 --> 00:59:25.135]  How much do you want?
[00:59:25.295 --> 00:59:27.597]  When do you want it now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:27.917 --> 00:59:28.718]  When will you need it?
[00:59:28.938 --> 00:59:31.379]  Will you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:31.519 --> 00:59:32.780]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:33.721]  Quarantine?
[00:59:33.941 --> 00:59:37.183]  Will you feed yourself or go to the gathering center for immunization?
[00:59:37.383 --> 00:59:41.106]  All of these problems disappear if you have a good supply of storable food.
[00:59:41.306 --> 00:59:44.608]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:44.848 --> 00:59:45.749]  How much will you need?
[00:59:46.169 --> 00:59:46.549]  Big Brother!
[01:00:08.132 --> 01:00:09.174]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.915 --> 01:00:11.016]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:11.677 --> 01:00:12.478]  You want answers?
[01:00:13.259 --> 01:00:14.180]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:18.466]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:19.007 --> 01:00:23.052]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.813 --> 01:00:25.454]  We get too reliant on YouTube.
[01:00:25.474 --> 01:00:29.995]  That's why we have PrisonPlanet.tv and it's all streamed in higher quality there, but that's just my videos.
[01:00:30.035 --> 01:00:32.676]  We have the video of Dennis Leary.
[01:00:33.356 --> 01:00:33.916]  It's a 9-11 truth.
[01:00:33.956 --> 01:00:36.857]  I've heard Daniel and others talk about the upcoming episodes.
[01:00:36.877 --> 01:00:38.357]  They come up and ask him politely.
[01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:39.818]  He goes, how do you know that?
[01:00:40.038 --> 01:00:40.578]  Who are you?
[01:00:40.618 --> 01:00:42.139]  Who are you with that hasn't thrown out?
[01:00:42.499 --> 01:00:43.219]  We can't play it.
[01:00:43.259 --> 01:00:44.339]  YouTube is down.
[01:00:44.779 --> 01:00:46.400]  Not my videos, YouTube itself.
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.181]  It's been having trouble the last few days.
[01:00:48.241 --> 01:00:49.381]  It's completely down right now.
[01:00:49.401 --> 01:00:55.705]  That is the videos, but if they come up in the next 30 minutes, we'll play a clip of that, and we'll play some clips of Daniel Sanjada on the show, Rescue Me.
[01:00:55.905 --> 01:00:58.266]  Daniel, I don't want to stir up stuff with you and Dennis Leary.
[01:00:59.727 --> 01:01:10.953]  You're a classy guy, and you're going back for another season with him, but I'm glad that he was still part of the show, even though it had the 9-11 truth stuff in it, but I'm surprised watching this response from him
[01:01:11.673 --> 01:01:18.577]  Very aggressive, nice people just asking questions at a book signing, that he was even part of something that brought up 9-11 Truth.
[01:01:19.118 --> 01:01:20.058]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:01:20.098 --> 01:01:35.528]  I mean, you know, Dennis gets approached by a lot of people, and I think that he, you know, I'm sure he's well aware of the controversial nature of the subject matter, you know, so to speak, that it was going to provoke, probably anticipating that it would provoke an emotional response from both sides of the fence, and maybe he just was
[01:01:36.235 --> 01:01:37.436]  Wary of being ambushed.
[01:01:37.636 --> 01:01:45.659]  You know, he might not have known with cameras on you and somebody asking you a question if he was being confronted or if he was just asking to, you know, being tacitly asked for his opinion.
[01:01:46.339 --> 01:01:49.101]  Oh, he might have thought it was TMZ or something.
[01:01:49.121 --> 01:01:49.661]  You never know.
[01:01:49.781 --> 01:01:51.742]  You never know what went through his mind.
[01:01:51.782 --> 01:02:02.867]  I mean, again, I have to give, I can only give Dennis, you know, credit and Peter Toland credit and FX credit for, you know, for allowing the subject matter on the show and for treating it with a relative amount of fairness.
[01:02:03.797 --> 01:02:08.339]  I don't think at the end of it that Franco, my character, was left wearing a dunce cap.
[01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:26.288]  I think that they just kind of, you know, let everything... They showed all the different emotional responses from the guys in the house to Sheila, the character named Sheila, who expresses her, you know, dissatisfaction with my opinion, claiming that Franco is turning, you know, turning her husband's death into a hobby.
[01:02:26.588 --> 01:02:31.490]  But in general, I think they just kind of let the audience decide for themselves, and that's laudable.
[01:02:33.251 --> 01:02:34.292]  Well, it certainly is.
[01:02:34.692 --> 01:02:40.055]  For those that haven't seen the show Rescue Me, break down what was discussed in that episode.
[01:02:41.215 --> 01:02:45.517]  Well, it was a subplot that stretched over about five episodes.
[01:02:45.577 --> 01:02:55.223]  The way it started was a French journalist comes to the firehouse and she wants to interview the guys about their experiences on 9-11 and their feelings about the day.
[01:02:55.783 --> 01:03:01.766]  And so in a series of vignettes with her interviewing each of us, I'm sorry,
[01:03:02.358 --> 01:03:04.380]  With her interviewing each of us individually.
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:11.565]  When she gets to my character, of course, I launch into this two-minute monologue about how 9-11 was an inside job and the reasons why.
[01:03:12.325 --> 01:03:18.710]  And then over the course of subsequent episodes, you see the responses from different characters in the firehouse.
[01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:19.711]  Some of them are violent.
[01:03:19.731 --> 01:03:26.576]  I almost get into a physical confrontation with one character, Michael Lombardi's character, the probie, in the firehouse kitchen.
[01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:31.800]  And then we have kind of a reconciliation scene later on where he explains to me why he felt the way he felt
[01:03:32.558 --> 01:03:36.981]  So, you know, they just allowed a lot of different perspectives to be communicated.
[01:03:38.182 --> 01:03:42.125]  It would have been nice to have one person, one character on the show be like, yeah, I agree with Franco.
[01:03:42.585 --> 01:03:45.067]  But, again, just the fact that they allowed me.
[01:03:45.087 --> 01:03:53.993]  Yeah, I mean, let me say, it's a distortion, but again, even allowing it on, though, and allowing one view is better than most, so I'm not trying to just attack here.
[01:03:54.613 --> 01:03:58.836]  But I've been to New York, and many of the firefighters know it's an inside job.
[01:03:58.856 --> 01:03:59.737]  They come and thank us.
[01:04:00.297 --> 01:04:00.877]  Shake our hands.
[01:04:00.957 --> 01:04:04.359]  I want to ask you about that, but there's all the videos of firefighters going.
[01:04:04.659 --> 01:04:05.840]  It was like it was a foundry.
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.081]  Lava flowing.
[01:04:07.541 --> 01:04:08.982]  You know, things were melting.
[01:04:09.742 --> 01:04:11.463]  The police saying, get back, they're going to blow up Building 7.
[01:04:11.843 --> 01:04:12.764]  So can you speak to that?
[01:04:12.824 --> 01:04:14.485]  I mean, you live in New York.
[01:04:14.545 --> 01:04:15.445]  You know these people.
[01:04:16.106 --> 01:04:17.226]  You're around firefighters.
[01:04:17.566 --> 01:04:19.227]  You're the star of a show about firefighters.
[01:04:20.008 --> 01:04:23.850]  What percentage would you say of them will tell you, oh yeah, Daniel, I agree with you?
[01:04:24.435 --> 01:04:43.482]  Well, I don't know about, I could not hazard a guess at the percentage of the total population of the FDNY because I don't know them all, but I'll say out of the firefighters that I know, I'd say about 60% of them are leaning towards us, leaning towards our take on things, that it was an inside job, that something's fishy, that we need to have a new investigation.
[01:04:44.222 --> 01:04:53.125]  Maybe 20% of the remaining 40 are undecided, and then maybe 20% are violently opposed to the idea, but I think more from the perspective of
[01:04:53.792 --> 01:04:58.995]  You know, just not being able to fathom the depth of that kind of betrayal.
[01:05:00.636 --> 01:05:06.019]  But in general, I know lots of firefighters that feel exactly the way you feel, that feel exactly the way I feel.
[01:05:06.039 --> 01:05:09.722]  I don't really know what to say about that.
[01:05:11.138 --> 01:05:11.679]  Well, that's one.
[01:05:11.719 --> 01:05:17.969]  Talking to Bill Doyle three years ago, he said about half or more of the families believe it's an inside job than he does.
[01:05:18.009 --> 01:05:19.090]  He lost his son, Joey.
[01:05:19.551 --> 01:05:20.993]  I've since talked to some of those groups.
[01:05:21.194 --> 01:05:23.217]  Three years later, they say, oh, it's basically 80% of us now.
[01:05:25.112 --> 01:05:28.315]  And, uh, but the media keeps this distortion going.
[01:05:28.335 --> 01:05:30.697]  The families don't like 9-11 truth.
[01:05:30.977 --> 01:05:35.642]  The families are upset with us when conservatively more than half agree with us.
[01:05:35.882 --> 01:05:36.602]  Right, right.
[01:05:36.662 --> 01:05:42.508]  I mean, you know, oh, you only have to look at it, you know, at a couple documentaries or do a couple searches on YouTube when it's working.
[01:05:43.068 --> 01:05:46.291]  And you can see the dissatisfaction of the families who are attending.
[01:05:46.687 --> 01:05:47.927]  The 9-11 Commission hearings.
[01:05:48.188 --> 01:06:00.732]  I mean, how many times were they interrupted by the victim's family members themselves, screaming and yelling in anger and frustration because their questions were not only not being answered, but were being completely sidestepped?
[01:06:00.752 --> 01:06:09.635]  It's clear and obvious that when somebody says you're insulting the memories of those who died, and you're causing pain to the victim's family, by asking for the truth,
[01:06:10.106 --> 01:06:11.647]  That's a logical fallacy.
[01:06:11.827 --> 01:06:14.409]  That is clearly wrong.
[01:06:14.429 --> 01:06:19.753]  Yeah, they're using the grief of the families and the dead as a shield against us for asking real questions.
[01:06:20.113 --> 01:06:21.674]  So they're abusing the dead.
[01:06:22.335 --> 01:06:22.795]  That's true.
[01:06:22.895 --> 01:06:23.255]  That's true.
[01:06:23.275 --> 01:06:29.740]  Not only are they disrespecting the dead, they are supporting those who, still to this day, have gotten away with mass murder.
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:33.142]  So they should really think twice about using that excuse to dismiss
[01:06:35.512 --> 01:06:40.214]  And these killers are still on the loose, as well, and planning to stage more events, make no mistake.
[01:06:40.234 --> 01:06:43.836]  But the fact that we've been exposing them kind of takes that false flag tool away.
[01:06:44.096 --> 01:06:56.842]  What did you think when New Yorker magazine, Cy Hirsch, and then even Keith Olbermann came out and admitted that Dick Cheney was planning to stage terror attacks on our ships to blame it on Iran, with U.S.
[01:06:56.882 --> 01:07:03.745]  patrol boats painted up like Iranians, and then they tried to have that staged event with fake radio chatter saying, we blow you up in one minute.
[01:07:04.773 --> 01:07:05.953]  I said that was staged at the time.
[01:07:06.253 --> 01:07:07.414]  Then it came out, it was staged.
[01:07:07.814 --> 01:07:09.434]  And then it comes out, they ordered the torture.
[01:07:09.714 --> 01:07:11.275]  I mean, these really are war criminals.
[01:07:11.295 --> 01:07:12.615]  These really are bad guys.
[01:07:12.655 --> 01:07:14.315]  I mean, this is on record.
[01:07:14.516 --> 01:07:16.436]  They've staged so much terror in the past.
[01:07:16.836 --> 01:07:20.137]  How can people not understand that it's normal to point the finger at them?
[01:07:20.757 --> 01:07:23.638]  Not just because of their history or the evidence, but because of the motive.
[01:07:24.358 --> 01:07:25.538]  Sure, absolutely.
[01:07:25.578 --> 01:07:29.119]  I mean, only they stood to gain from, you know, from all of these atrocities.
[01:07:29.339 --> 01:07:31.700]  You know, it's Kibona who has benefited.
[01:07:32.842 --> 01:07:39.684]  In the case of 9-11, it certainly wasn't the 19 people who supposedly died in carrying out the attack.
[01:07:39.784 --> 01:07:43.566]  It certainly hasn't been Osama Bin Laden.
[01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:45.666]  Arguably, Halliburton has certainly benefited.
[01:07:45.906 --> 01:07:48.487]  Dick Cheney has certainly benefited.
[01:07:48.627 --> 01:07:53.289]  Other military contractors, energy corporations, the list goes on.
[01:07:53.329 --> 01:07:58.090]  If you follow the money, it's clear who has benefited, given the fact that they announced their agenda before the day.
[01:08:01.607 --> 01:08:11.449]  And then that agenda has been prosecuted every day since, and they've been invoking 9-11 and its victims as justification for, you know, everything that they've done here and everything that we've been doing abroad.
[01:08:11.489 --> 01:08:12.909]  I mean, it's quite clear.
[01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:22.251]  I mean, I don't understand where we, where this bottomless well of, you know, benefit of the doubt, where this comes from and when does it finally run out?
[01:08:22.311 --> 01:08:27.112]  I mean, a government that lies about air quality and exposes people to toxic dust
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:30.681]  Intentionally, in order to reopen Wall Street.
[01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:41.463]  A government that, you know, legalizes torture, that manufactures legal opinions in order to justify circumventing the Constitution so that they can torture people.
[01:08:42.603 --> 01:08:45.224]  A government that illegally wiretaps and look on Olbermann.
[01:08:45.264 --> 01:08:54.166]  You had Russell Tice go on there about three months ago and tell Olbermann to his face that the NSA was collecting information, specifically collecting information on intellectuals and journalists.
[01:08:54.993 --> 01:08:57.855]  Uh, and you see, you see Olbermann Space go white there for a second.
[01:08:58.195 --> 01:08:58.976]  And Congress!
[01:08:59.216 --> 01:08:59.837]  And Congress.
[01:09:00.017 --> 01:09:01.097]  I mean, like, what more?
[01:09:01.117 --> 01:09:18.810]  I mean, with all of these damning, you know, realities, why, where is the... I don't understand when, when is the wall of cognitive dissonance finally going to break and people just accept the fact, uh, or at least entertain the very serious possibility and look at the evidence of 9-11 being an inside job and all these other things that you're talking about.
[01:09:19.190 --> 01:09:22.372]  I mean, and in this day and time, there's just so much going on, Alex.
[01:09:22.433 --> 01:09:23.353]  My head swirls.
[01:09:23.413 --> 01:09:24.414]  I sometimes cannot
[01:09:24.795 --> 01:09:29.559]  Sometimes for a couple weeks I literally just have to totally tune out because I feel like it's just too much.
[01:09:29.599 --> 01:09:31.740]  I can't, you know, continue with my day.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:39.146]  I can't continue just living life normally because I'm so caught up in all these tectonic events that seem to just come one right after the other.
[01:09:39.206 --> 01:09:40.027]  It's the economy.
[01:09:40.087 --> 01:09:43.189]  It's pipe bombs being detonated in New Jersey.
[01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:49.374]  It's, you know, the massacre at the Jewish Museum or this unfortunate shooting of the security guard at the Jewish Museum.
[01:09:50.287 --> 01:09:58.737]  Glenn Beck shooting his mouth off and trying to make these links between 9-11 truth and this psycho who committed this crazy act the other day.
[01:09:58.777 --> 01:10:01.420]  I mean, it's just so much and it's endless.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.361]  It's just endless.
[01:10:03.123 --> 01:10:04.464]  And it's always right on time.
[01:10:04.484 --> 01:10:14.592]  You know, this Brun guy, Von Brun, was in federal custody for six years and has classic Southern Poverty Law Center fingerprints, not exactly ADL.
[01:10:15.433 --> 01:10:22.058]  I mean, it was Southern Poverty Law Center and declassified FBI documents running the Elohim City white supremacist compound that McVeigh came out of.
[01:10:22.979 --> 01:10:35.841]  And it's the same with all these, quote, black Muslim groups that turn out to be black Christian street kids who they pay money to just dress in camo and they give them a warehouse and then even mainstream news has to admit time and time again that it's totally made up.
[01:10:36.322 --> 01:10:37.462]  Wow.
[01:10:37.562 --> 01:10:39.382]  Or fake Klan groups in Dallas.
[01:10:39.922 --> 01:10:42.363]  I mean, led by the FBI, they're going to blow things up.
[01:10:43.503 --> 01:10:49.004]  And right on time as the Federal Reserve is about to be audited, that is so exciting and
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:55.384]  But we've got to know that the elite are going to come after those of us that are fighting them, but we don't have a choice.
[01:10:55.424 --> 01:11:02.750]  But I sense in my gut, Daniel Sanjata, because of your courage and millions of other people's courage, that the momentum is shifting.
[01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:10.095]  We're not winning yet, but we're beginning to gain on them, and the arrogance is draining out of these corrupt people.
[01:11:10.536 --> 01:11:11.336]  Well, it didn't.
[01:11:11.396 --> 01:11:13.338]  I mean, you know, I'm sure you've seen.
[01:11:13.518 --> 01:11:14.118]  I know you've seen.
[01:11:14.359 --> 01:11:17.081]  As a matter of fact, you responded to it already, early.
[01:11:18.318 --> 01:11:26.108]  Uh, when Glenn, in that clip with Glenn Beck and that, I guess that CIA veteran, I don't know who the other, you know who the quote-unquote expert was that he was talking to?
[01:11:26.128 --> 01:11:28.672]  Yeah, it was all a bunch of spooks and think tanks.
[01:11:29.112 --> 01:11:30.574]  It was all intelligence operatives.
[01:11:30.654 --> 01:11:31.956]  Okay, well, you know...
[01:11:33.017 --> 01:11:34.879]  It just smelled of desperation.
[01:11:35.459 --> 01:11:37.261]  I hear the music, so we'll come back to that.
[01:11:37.301 --> 01:11:37.741]  Exactly.
[01:11:37.801 --> 01:11:38.302]  No, you're right.
[01:11:38.342 --> 01:11:40.964]  I mean, they were just... And then you look at the CIA guy.
[01:11:41.024 --> 01:11:48.731]  Beck's such an egomaniac with narcissism that he was enjoying it, but the other spooks were, yeah, the American people of Al-Qaeda, yeah.
[01:11:49.011 --> 01:11:53.155]  I mean, they just looked like they could be blown over by...
[01:11:54.462 --> 01:11:55.503]  You know, by a five-year-old.
[01:11:55.563 --> 01:11:57.564]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:11:57.584 --> 01:11:58.365]  I agree with you.
[01:11:58.385 --> 01:11:58.745]  Stay there.
[01:11:58.985 --> 01:12:00.607]  Daniel Sanjada is our guest.
[01:12:00.627 --> 01:12:01.867]  Final segment straight ahead.
[01:12:01.968 --> 01:12:03.168]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:12:03.208 --> 01:12:08.552]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:12:08.793 --> 01:12:13.436]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:12:13.816 --> 01:12:14.217]  It's true.
[01:12:14.297 --> 01:12:18.900]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:24.084]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:12:24.602 --> 01:12:31.526]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:12:31.726 --> 01:12:32.626]  And here's the best part.
[01:12:32.846 --> 01:12:39.210]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:12:39.530 --> 01:12:42.372]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:12:42.732 --> 01:12:45.713]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:12:45.733 --> 01:12:45.974]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:12:45.994 --> 01:12:46.234]  Remember,
[01:12:54.653 --> 01:12:58.255]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:12:58.575 --> 01:13:01.017]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:07.681]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:13:08.401 --> 01:13:13.745]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:13:14.285 --> 01:13:20.449]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:13:20.769 --> 01:13:22.590]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:25.112]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:13:25.212 --> 01:13:36.160]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:13:38.381 --> 01:13:39.662]  It's not about left or right.
[01:13:40.062 --> 01:13:41.463]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:13:41.924 --> 01:13:48.148]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:13:57.077 --> 01:13:58.238]  The Obama Deception.
[01:13:58.658 --> 01:13:59.859]  The people strike back!
[01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:04.892]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[01:14:05.272 --> 01:14:11.258]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[01:15:04.992 --> 01:15:07.632]  We're way beyond a question of if and when it's upon us.
[01:15:08.073 --> 01:15:12.593]  When you can't safely touch anything and a cough or sneeze can shut down your school or business.
[01:15:12.973 --> 01:15:20.075]  How would you or could you disinfect a school bus, office, locker room, place of worship, or your entire home and do it in just minutes?

[01:15:49.073 --> 01:15:50.574]  You can't buy Hazurid in stores.
[01:15:51.054 --> 01:15:53.835]  Order online at Hazurid.com or call 800-675-0323.
[01:15:53.855 --> 01:15:54.055]  That's 800-675-0323.
[01:16:18.023 --> 01:16:25.755]  Oh, I can't start playing that song without hearing the rest of it.
[01:16:25.775 --> 01:16:27.138]  I'm gonna come in with that next break.
[01:16:35.046 --> 01:16:40.771]  We're going to finish up with Daniel Senjata, and then he says he'll come back in the next month for a full hour and take your calls.
[01:16:41.291 --> 01:16:42.752]  They've got some family stuff coming up today.
[01:16:42.772 --> 01:16:49.238]  Daniel, the time we have left, you were saying, and I jumped in and started seconding you, you were saying that it seemed like desperation.
[01:16:49.298 --> 01:16:49.798]  Exactly.
[01:16:49.818 --> 01:16:58.025]  It was like insecure and panicked, and they knew they were doing something dirty, trying to say that this guy was a hero of 9-11 Truth, but with no source.
[01:16:58.365 --> 01:16:59.005]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:59.345 --> 01:17:02.106]  I guess that's the only other point I wanted to make is, based on what?
[01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:06.887]  Because he gives this brief caveat, he's like, that's what the evidence points to now.
[01:17:06.947 --> 01:17:08.427]  It's early, we can't confirm this.
[01:17:08.547 --> 01:17:22.991]  Just like with the FEMA camps, he can either confirm or deny at the end of the day, but with this particular thing, you would think if he's going to open his mouth and say something like that and link a notoriously non-violent movement like 9-11 Truth with something as despicable as what happened at that museum that day.
[01:17:23.753 --> 01:17:25.074]  Uh, then you better have a source.
[01:17:25.294 --> 01:17:27.195]  You better have a reason for saying something like that.
[01:17:27.255 --> 01:17:37.239]  And I just hope that everybody listening to the show will, uh, will just assault, uh, Glenn Beck's email and telephone nonstop until he issues some type of an apology.
[01:17:37.279 --> 01:17:41.821]  Because just like with the Geraldo Rivera thing, uh, trying to link us to the bombing in Times Square.
[01:17:42.162 --> 01:17:44.983]  I mean, this is just, it's so, it just smacks of such desperation.
[01:17:45.023 --> 01:17:45.903]  It's so pathetic.
[01:17:46.023 --> 01:17:49.485]  And it's just so, you could even tell in their body language that they knew that they were lying.
[01:17:50.347 --> 01:17:52.790]  Glenn is just a despicable character.
[01:17:52.810 --> 01:17:54.252]  I hate to speak badly of anyone.
[01:18:05.919 --> 01:18:10.782]  But then he says, in the new Senate, this guy was a hero to 9-11 Truth.
[01:18:10.822 --> 01:18:19.788]  I mean, 9-11 Truth is very diverse, obviously, but I would call it more classical, liberal, progressive, overall, than I would call it conservative.
[01:18:19.828 --> 01:18:21.069]  But I mean, you know, it's every stripe.
[01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:24.011]  But it decries racism and things like that.
[01:18:24.031 --> 01:18:24.512]  Sure.
[01:18:24.892 --> 01:18:28.915]  I mean, who from the 9-11 Truth community has been advocating or calling for violence?
[01:18:29.295 --> 01:18:29.635]  No one.
[01:18:30.055 --> 01:18:32.517]  As a matter of fact, we want to avoid it at all costs.
[01:18:33.007 --> 01:18:35.690]  It's not us who's perpetrating the violence.
[01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:40.696]  We're trying to expose those who have committed violent acts because we don't want to see that.
[01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:41.697]  We don't want bloodshed.
[01:18:41.757 --> 01:18:42.458]  We decry that.
[01:18:43.098 --> 01:18:44.140]  We'll take We Are Change.
[01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:45.181]  Take We Are Change.
[01:18:45.621 --> 01:18:46.763]  They're all about Gandhi.
[01:18:46.803 --> 01:18:47.944]  Be the change you want to see in the world.
[01:18:48.004 --> 01:18:48.625]  Nonviolent.
[01:18:48.965 --> 01:18:50.266]  Yeah, I think that's a very likely possibility.
[01:19:14.116 --> 01:19:19.417]  Most of everybody listening right now knows for a fact that something is wrong with what we've been told about 9-11.
[01:19:20.157 --> 01:19:21.398]  We need a reinvestigation.
[01:19:21.538 --> 01:19:22.098]  That's clear.
[01:19:22.458 --> 01:19:24.919]  There's been a lot of progress that's been made on many fronts.
[01:19:25.159 --> 01:19:29.300]  Alex has made movie upon movie upon movie.
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:34.441]  The Corps of Corruption series has been very eye-opening and enlightening.
[01:19:34.741 --> 01:19:38.862]  The Fabled Enemies, Jason Berman's film, really great job on that.
[01:19:39.338 --> 01:19:44.601]  I mean, on so many fronts, we're making progress, and I think that we just have to continue to, you know, to storm the castle.
[01:19:45.422 --> 01:19:46.543]  We can't get complacent.
[01:19:48.384 --> 01:19:50.866]  It's palpable right now, I think, in the air.
[01:19:50.906 --> 01:19:58.350]  I think people can feel that there's something on the horizon, and I think that people might be a little bit scared, not knowing, is it going to be something positive?
[01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:59.451]  Is it going to be something negative?
[01:19:59.791 --> 01:20:01.552]  I think we could certainly make it something positive.
[01:20:01.653 --> 01:20:06.956]  I think humanity stands at the threshold of a real opportunity for a quantum transformation
[01:20:07.781 --> 01:20:13.383]  Not just, you know, get all metaphysical and spiritual, but I think... No, it's a tipping point.
[01:20:13.423 --> 01:20:15.464]  We're going into evil or we're going into good.
[01:20:15.484 --> 01:20:16.784]  We've got to make a choice.
[01:20:17.185 --> 01:20:18.405]  We really do have to make a choice.
[01:20:18.425 --> 01:20:21.046]  And the battle lines are, I mean, it's clear.
[01:20:21.246 --> 01:20:21.586]  It's clear.
[01:20:22.226 --> 01:20:28.669]  As you say all the time, you're either on the side of humanity, free humanity, or you're on the side of the globalists at this point.
[01:20:28.829 --> 01:20:30.790]  And being neutral is really not an option.
[01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:31.890]  Neutrality equals
[01:20:32.993 --> 01:20:33.333]  I don't know.
[01:20:50.888 --> 01:20:51.708]  Oh, it's excellent!
[01:20:52.008 --> 01:20:52.868]  I hope you do more!
[01:20:52.968 --> 01:20:53.448]  Wow, go ahead.
[01:20:53.468 --> 01:20:54.309]  Thank you, thank you, Alec.
[01:20:54.729 --> 01:21:08.211]  But, you know, just the way that the media unfairly addresses the issue of 9-11, when they even address it at all, it's either the style of Glenn Beck, or Joe Scarborough, or Bill O'Reilly, or it's total blackout.
[01:21:08.671 --> 01:21:09.931]  And that's really a shame.
[01:21:09.951 --> 01:21:18.333]  I don't know how many more articles Alan Miller has to publish about 41 intelligence experts and people from inside the intelligence community saying 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:23.264]  Or, you know, people from inside other branches of the government.
[01:21:24.445 --> 01:21:27.287]  Pilots for 9-11 Truths, 700 engineers.
[01:21:28.068 --> 01:21:29.429]  It's just ridiculous at this point.
[01:21:29.449 --> 01:21:33.112]  I mean, we clearly have a critical mass of experts from relevant fields of expertise.
[01:21:33.152 --> 01:21:38.857]  Now all we need is a platform where they can speak what they know and people like me can get out of the way.
[01:21:38.877 --> 01:21:40.419]  We're just, you know, vented.
[01:21:42.682 --> 01:21:45.043]  Daniel Senjata, let me say bye to you during this break.
[01:21:45.103 --> 01:21:45.963]  We'll have you back soon.
[01:21:46.003 --> 01:21:46.683]  God bless you.
[01:21:47.024 --> 01:21:48.444]  And listen, we salute your courage.
[01:21:48.604 --> 01:21:49.545]  I salute you guys as well.
[01:21:49.585 --> 01:21:50.025]  God bless.
[01:21:52.025 --> 01:21:52.926]  We're on the march.
[01:21:53.406 --> 01:21:55.007]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:55.927 --> 01:21:58.648]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:01.641 --> 01:22:10.307]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:22:10.747 --> 01:22:15.450]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:18.472]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[01:22:18.892 --> 01:22:20.513]  Actually results in disease.
[01:22:20.953 --> 01:22:29.719]  Go to AmericanSuperfoods.com today and see the wide range of foods available that were designed to help your mind and body work the way they were intended to.

[01:22:55.353 --> 01:22:57.614]  Go to AmericanSuperfoods.com.

[01:23:01.435 --> 01:23:08.418]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years, Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:23:08.598 --> 01:23:12.563]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called InnerFood.
[01:23:12.864 --> 01:23:14.406]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:23:14.726 --> 01:23:21.035]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[01:23:22.176 --> 01:23:24.720]  InnerFood is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:26.501]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[01:23:26.761 --> 01:23:29.542]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[01:23:29.782 --> 01:23:31.222]  And their formula really works.
[01:23:31.482 --> 01:23:34.043]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:23:34.303 --> 01:23:35.564]  Try the Nutra Cafe.
[01:23:35.804 --> 01:23:40.145]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boost the immune system.
[01:23:40.566 --> 01:23:42.766]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:23:42.986 --> 01:23:45.247]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:23:45.447 --> 01:23:47.208]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:23:47.548 --> 01:23:49.969]  Go to www.nutracafe.com.

[01:24:01.656 --> 01:24:10.362]  Know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[01:24:10.522 --> 01:24:18.507]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[01:24:18.667 --> 01:24:23.188]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[01:24:23.248 --> 01:24:25.889]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[01:24:26.009 --> 01:24:37.311]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.

[01:24:57.658 --> 01:24:58.919]  It is the second day of the money bomb.
[01:25:18.104 --> 01:25:22.268]  Last year, the donations kept coming in after the first day for three days, so we kind of let it go for a few days.
[01:25:22.288 --> 01:25:29.515]  We do this once a year to support equipment, expanding the TV studio, hiring more people, and you've really come through.
[01:25:30.676 --> 01:25:32.758]  I can tell you that we're about $3,000, $4,000 away from our goal of $250,000.
[01:25:36.974 --> 01:25:50.381]  But throughout the weekend, if you want to give $5, $10, $100, $1,000 so we can really up our game against the New World Order, you're looking at the guy that puts out the number one viral films, the Obama deception, Endgame, Terror Storm, Truth Rising, Road to Tyranny.
[01:25:50.681 --> 01:25:54.183]  You're looking at the progenitor of the 9-11 Truth Movement, there from the start.
[01:25:56.164 --> 01:25:57.325]  And I know we can have victory.
[01:25:58.085 --> 01:26:02.888]  You're looking at what Ron Paul said, half his support in his campaign came from this radio show.
[01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:06.270]  We need to expand that platform.
[01:26:09.445 --> 01:26:11.626]  We need to come together against the New World Order.
[01:26:13.606 --> 01:26:19.567]  So please go to Infowarsmoneybomb.com right now and donate.
[01:26:19.607 --> 01:26:20.728]  You can do it through Sunday.
[01:26:20.788 --> 01:26:22.348]  We'll cut it off Monday.
[01:26:23.208 --> 01:26:27.149]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com or 888-201-2244.
[01:26:27.749 --> 01:26:29.230]  We will have people here this weekend.
[01:26:29.850 --> 01:26:30.910]  You'll have to call in and donate.
[01:26:30.930 --> 01:26:33.931]  But let's hear a little bit more from Bob Marley, then I'll get back into the news.
[01:26:39.011 --> 01:26:39.671]  I feel.
[01:26:40.071 --> 01:26:44.513]  They don't want to see us unite.
[01:27:08.504 --> 01:27:11.465]  Respond to their tyranny!
[01:27:38.723 --> 01:27:41.805]  All right, I'm in a news blitz now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:41.845 --> 01:27:49.031]  But I just want to put that call out to people one more time to support this radio show.
[01:27:49.051 --> 01:27:55.155]  Where did you hear first that we were at level six a month and a half ago?
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:57.722]  Here, now it's mainstream news.
[01:27:57.802 --> 01:27:59.323]  We were under level 6 the whole time.
[01:27:59.343 --> 01:28:05.590]  UN control of the nations of the world as they prepare, saying the pandemic will break back out in the fall and winter.
[01:28:05.670 --> 01:28:06.671]  I'm not saying that's happening.
[01:28:06.711 --> 01:28:07.432]  They're saying that.
[01:28:07.452 --> 01:28:09.534]  And that they're going to give us forced inoculations.
[01:28:09.954 --> 01:28:11.536]  Just Google forced inoculations.
[01:28:12.096 --> 01:28:15.380]  It is all over the news.
[01:28:18.703 --> 01:28:20.605]  Martial law, Fox says, is a good thing.
[01:28:20.905 --> 01:28:22.066]  They're acclimating you.
[01:28:22.086 --> 01:28:27.011]  They're getting everybody used to hearing federalization, martial law, quarantine, lockdown.
[01:28:27.351 --> 01:28:33.096]  All over the world, governments are using this for tyranny, as directed by the United Nations.
[01:28:33.196 --> 01:28:44.267]  So that's why we need to be strong going into this depression, going into this collapse, so we can make sure we're not just maintaining but expanding as our voice is needed more and more as this platform with
[01:28:45.191 --> 01:29:01.788]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts today, father of Reaganomics, exposing the fake conservatism and the corruption of the Republican and Democratic parties, and the betrayals of Obama, and Bob Chapman, and then Daniel Sanjata, the star of Rescue Me and other TV programs, standing up with courage.
[01:29:04.351 --> 01:29:08.455]  It is so important, ladies and gentlemen, that we respond to tyranny in the Infowar.
[01:29:11.224 --> 01:29:14.426]  And you can support us by getting the t-shirts, the books, the videos.
[01:29:14.687 --> 01:29:16.028]  All of it's about educating others.
[01:29:16.048 --> 01:29:18.970]  When you wear a Tyranny Response Team t-shirt, people ask, what is that?
[01:29:19.010 --> 01:29:22.652]  You can explain how you're standing up for the Republic, how you're really defending America.
[01:29:24.354 --> 01:29:27.196]  Instead of being troops off in foreign lands for the bankers.
[01:29:28.317 --> 01:29:37.784]  Or when you donate for the Money Bomb, it allows us to know we've got that money for the year to make the expansions that need to be made and to maintain what we've already built.
[01:29:38.547 --> 01:29:42.430]  We've done so much in the last year, more than we did in three or four years before combined.
[01:29:42.670 --> 01:29:43.891]  We're accelerating what we're doing.
[01:29:44.191 --> 01:29:45.492]  Please call, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:45.512 --> 01:30:06.489]  Let's go above last year's $250,000, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, or infowarsmoneybomb.com, because I want to get to that $50,000 mark in the next 23 minutes before the show ends and reach that goal, and then we'll find out Monday what happened over the weekend and how above and beyond that we went.
[01:30:07.534 --> 01:30:13.279]  We're gonna hire more webmasters, more video editors, bigger TV studio, everything because of your support.
[01:30:13.339 --> 01:30:14.000]  We salute you.
[01:30:17.042 --> 01:30:23.548]  Alright, you know, I got into this ABC News, AP, also this is the News of Australia, originally broke it, was the Australian.
[01:30:24.409 --> 01:30:25.950]  Vioxx maker Merck and co.
[01:30:25.990 --> 01:30:29.213]  drew up Dr. Hit List for those to be liquidated, those to be killed.
[01:30:30.134 --> 01:30:30.975]  That's mainstream news.
[01:30:31.015 --> 01:30:37.359]  Those criticizing their drugs that are killing people like Vioxx and the human papillomavirus, the Gardasil drugs.
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:39.541]  And these are hardcore people.
[01:30:40.262 --> 01:30:44.305]  Got articles with the local police and military training for gun confiscation.
[01:30:44.645 --> 01:30:57.455]  We broke two days ago that the VFW is being told to prepare even Civil War cannons and things and Spanish-American War guns, rifles, daggers, so the BATF can confiscate them when they need to.
[01:30:58.235 --> 01:30:58.916]  That's happening.
[01:30:59.036 --> 01:31:03.201]  Obama oust AmeriCorps' director who investigated Friend.
[01:31:03.681 --> 01:31:05.604]  AP reports Obama incredibly corrupt.
[01:31:05.644 --> 01:31:14.173]  President Obama says he has lost confidence in the Inspector General who investigates AmeriCorps and other national service programs and has told Congress he is removing him from the position.
[01:31:14.634 --> 01:31:18.238]  Obama's move follows an investigation by IG Gerald Walpin.
[01:31:19.588 --> 01:31:30.790]  uh... finding misuse of federal grants by a non-partisan education group led by sacramento mayor kevin johnson who is an obama supporter and former nba basketball star walton was criticized by the acting u.s.
[01:31:30.850 --> 01:31:34.611]  attorney in sacramento for the way he handled the investigation of johnson and st.
[01:31:34.631 --> 01:31:42.193]  hope academy a non-profit group that received hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal grants from the corporation of national community service so obama's fired this person
[01:31:42.833 --> 01:31:53.869]  To cover up, he's already, of the stimulus package, $4 billion to ACORN and AmeriCorps and Citi year, run by the Karl Rove of four to five administrations.
[01:31:53.889 --> 01:31:54.670]  You can debate that.
[01:31:56.892 --> 01:32:13.219]  David Gergen, Aaron, a few weeks ago did a huge report, and that's those videos they put on TV with taxpayer money of, this is my uniform, I'm city year in red and black uniforms, marching in tattletale squads, their own private political army illegally being recruited with federal money.
[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:18.821]  Oh, ACORN's not corrupt during the election, and then just look at it now.
[01:32:22.975 --> 01:32:27.237]  So Obama is just a big Chicago machine corrupt thug.
[01:32:28.197 --> 01:32:28.717]  Now look at this.
[01:32:28.737 --> 01:32:32.239]  I want to shift gears into another subject.
[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:39.742]  I have interviewed Ben Livingston, the meteorologist, the father of weather weapons.
[01:32:42.143 --> 01:32:42.823]  The guy's amazing.
[01:32:42.863 --> 01:32:43.983]  World War II vet.
[01:32:44.484 --> 01:32:50.186]  Flew into... Hurricanes are in our side of the world and they only go up to about 200 miles an hour.
[01:32:51.138 --> 01:32:55.019]  They can go up 250, 300 miles an hour, and they call them typhoons.
[01:32:55.579 --> 01:32:56.660]  Flew into typhoons.
[01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:01.922]  He was their leading fighter squadrons in Vietnam, manipulating.
[01:33:02.422 --> 01:33:06.423]  He would go in where there were no clouds and make it rain 10 feet on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
[01:33:06.443 --> 01:33:07.083]  Just amazing.
[01:33:07.743 --> 01:33:11.325]  And I got sent documents by a listener going, this was just declassified.
[01:33:11.345 --> 01:33:11.725]  I think it was 2002.
[01:33:14.462 --> 01:33:22.104]  Well, PrisonPlanet.tv members can watch the Ben Livingston interviews, but the point is... And then it got ripped to the YouTube channel, so it's out there, but in high quality for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:33:22.684 --> 01:33:26.645]  The issue is that he was the father of weather weapons.
[01:33:26.805 --> 01:33:28.885]  He got Stanford Research Institute to develop it.
[01:33:28.905 --> 01:33:34.446]  He became the head of the... It was the Navy.
[01:33:34.826 --> 01:33:36.987]  After that, the Navy Weapons Laboratory.
[01:33:37.327 --> 01:33:38.667]  Just an amazing individual.
[01:33:39.107 --> 01:33:41.308]  And he flew these fighter jets into typhoons.
[01:33:41.348 --> 01:33:41.448]  He...
[01:33:43.786 --> 01:33:44.826]  You know, did all of this stuff.
[01:33:44.866 --> 01:33:47.067]  He was the first guy to fly into hurricanes and typhoons.
[01:33:48.387 --> 01:33:56.588]  And by 1967, they had certified that they could kill hurricanes, make hurricanes, weaken hurricanes, strengthen hurricanes.
[01:33:57.569 --> 01:34:00.589]  And he said, with today's technologies, back then it would take a hundred aircraft.
[01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:04.270]  With eight aircraft, he could go in and kill a hurricane or make a hurricane.
[01:34:06.810 --> 01:34:10.811]  And he was calling for a Department of Weather.
[01:34:12.128 --> 01:34:12.908]  To control the weather.
[01:34:13.308 --> 01:34:15.549]  And he also runs a big weather control operation.
[01:34:16.129 --> 01:34:17.349]  He's their chief meteorologist.
[01:34:18.170 --> 01:34:23.511]  He got some heat coming on the show, and he's still a nice guy, but he won't come on after he originally came on, because he got a lot of heat from the spooks.
[01:34:23.871 --> 01:34:27.012]  We kind of snuck up on folks, because I got the documents from a listener.
[01:34:27.652 --> 01:34:28.813]  It was nowhere in the news.
[01:34:29.293 --> 01:34:32.474]  I checked the National Archives, found they'd just been declassified six months before.
[01:34:33.174 --> 01:34:34.375]  These listeners giving us tips.
[01:34:35.116 --> 01:34:36.117]  I called Ben Livingston.
[01:34:36.157 --> 01:34:37.238]  I said, I'd like to have you on the radio.
[01:34:37.358 --> 01:34:37.938]  Had him on.
[01:34:37.999 --> 01:34:39.560]  Suddenly it was Fox News, CNN.
[01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:40.921]  But still they hadn't interviewed him.
[01:34:41.222 --> 01:34:42.383]  I said, fly here next week.
[01:34:42.423 --> 01:34:43.083]  I want to interview you.
[01:34:43.103 --> 01:34:44.324]  That's going to be in the Chemtrail film.
[01:34:44.344 --> 01:34:49.990]  But the issue is, is that he got here and he got into weather control.
[01:34:51.101 --> 01:34:56.182]  Now that's separate from HAARP and all these other technologies, but the issue is they can control hurricanes in 67.
[01:34:56.402 --> 01:35:00.563]  That's 40 years ago, isn't it?
[01:35:00.603 --> 01:35:01.703]  Yeah, 40 years ago.
[01:35:02.463 --> 01:35:03.383]  42, 3 years ago.
[01:35:04.483 --> 01:35:06.024]  So then they say there's no weather control.
[01:35:06.584 --> 01:35:12.605]  And then we started noticing in the mid-90s that suddenly condensation trails were forming at 2,000 or 3,000 feet in the summer.
[01:35:12.685 --> 01:35:13.205]  Impossible.
[01:35:13.525 --> 01:35:15.005]  And they were staying there for hours.
[01:35:15.445 --> 01:35:17.926]  And they'd always disappeared, even at high altitudes, in a few minutes.
[01:35:19.485 --> 01:35:31.790]  And then we started getting reports of low-altitude spraying, high-altitude spraying, helicopter spraying, declassified admissions of spraying Subtilis GlobaG bacteria all over New Mexico, all over Texas, Oklahoma, killing people with it.
[01:35:33.210 --> 01:35:34.991]  That was in the Daily Oklahoman.
[01:35:35.991 --> 01:35:43.614]  All of this is going on and happening, and still you're called a kook if you talk about it.
[01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:54.303]  And then I began to interview a meteorologist and a climatologist on this show and weathermen from major TV stations going, no, no, yeah, you can see them spraying here.
[01:35:54.783 --> 01:35:57.464]  And now in Florida news, they go, look at all these lines sprayed.
[01:35:57.524 --> 01:35:59.805]  Somebody, the government's doing that, but it doesn't look like chaff.
[01:36:00.125 --> 01:36:01.326]  Chaff's in a small area.
[01:36:01.346 --> 01:36:06.087]  It was, you know, like the whole area blocking storms about to hit, I guess, to keep the drought going.
[01:36:06.527 --> 01:36:10.769]  And so everybody, all these meteorologists who learned that this isn't normal
[01:36:12.227 --> 01:36:17.413]  They're now going, oh, that's because there's new phenomenon, new clouds, new systems being discovered.
[01:36:18.234 --> 01:36:22.499]  And it's normal to have barium salts and aluminum dioxide raining down.
[01:36:23.601 --> 01:36:28.163]  And we said, folks, it's at least a weather modification program with a bunch of other programs rolled in.
[01:36:28.644 --> 01:36:34.747]  Then listeners began to email us two years ago going, high-altitude aerosol spraying.
[01:36:34.787 --> 01:36:35.327]  Google that.
[01:36:35.347 --> 01:36:35.968]  So I googled it.
[01:36:36.368 --> 01:36:37.248]  And it was thousands.
[01:36:37.288 --> 01:36:48.655]  Department of Energy, the Japanese Department of Energy, German Department of Energy, and Power, and British, and all these countries, and NASA saying we've dimmed the Earth by 20% for its safety, and kids' textbooks.
[01:36:48.675 --> 01:36:50.616]  They always tell parents, there's no plan to chip you.
[01:36:50.636 --> 01:36:52.317]  But then the kids' textbooks say, we're going to chip you.
[01:36:52.357 --> 01:36:52.697]  It's good.
[01:36:53.277 --> 01:36:54.597]  You know, there's a world government, it's good.
[01:36:54.617 --> 01:36:57.858]  You know, in the textbooks, they tell parents, it doesn't exist, but your kid's been taught it's good.
[01:36:58.199 --> 01:37:00.379]  You know, the weird psychological warfare going on.
[01:37:01.219 --> 01:37:12.963]  Textbooks saying it was happening, and then, a few months ago, his head of science department comes out, Obama, and says, oh, we're going to spray the skies with barium, salt, and aluminum dioxide to save the Earth from global warming.
[01:37:13.243 --> 01:37:15.504]  When the science actually shows it's causing warming.
[01:37:16.044 --> 01:37:17.245]  Which they may need to do.
[01:37:17.285 --> 01:37:18.566]  It looks like we're going into an ice age.
[01:37:18.586 --> 01:37:19.446]  They're trying to block it.
[01:37:19.987 --> 01:37:20.647]  And they would do that.
[01:37:20.687 --> 01:37:21.808]  It would really be an ice age.
[01:37:21.828 --> 01:37:22.688]  They're trying to block it.
[01:37:22.708 --> 01:37:26.031]  And they say, we've got to have a carbon tax to control us, saying it's heat.
[01:37:26.751 --> 01:37:29.413]  So they can then, as we get cold, say that they saved us from that.
[01:37:29.733 --> 01:37:30.694]  I don't know what they're doing.
[01:37:30.934 --> 01:37:33.976]  Can they use the weather weapons they admittedly have to cause all these problems?
[01:37:34.176 --> 01:37:35.657]  And then say, oh look, it's climate change.
[01:37:35.697 --> 01:37:36.277]  Do what we want.
[01:37:37.478 --> 01:37:39.359]  That's what witch doctors would do thousands of years ago.
[01:37:39.399 --> 01:37:42.061]  Every time there was a problem, they'd say the Hooju God had done it or whatever.
[01:37:43.957 --> 01:37:48.020]  It's all psychology, it's all chicanery and scams and bamboozling people.
[01:37:48.961 --> 01:37:56.286]  But we know they have weather weapons, we know the program's going on, and then suddenly they just come out and say, okay, we're doing tests.
[01:37:56.906 --> 01:38:03.431]  Thousands of agencies around the world and companies and tens of billions of dollars we know of a year.
[01:38:03.691 --> 01:38:05.953]  I mean, you can go spend the entire weekend, it's Friday.
[01:38:06.553 --> 01:38:12.796]  Go look at chemtrails admitted, or passive and non-passive aerosol altitude spraying campaigns.
[01:38:12.836 --> 01:38:13.656]  Google terms like that.
[01:38:13.957 --> 01:38:20.760]  Tens of thousands of hits, universities, how they're spraying, the tests they did, how it's added to jet fuel, dispersed out of the engines.
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:23.001]  It's all compartmentalized.
[01:38:23.041 --> 01:38:26.622]  It goes through the jet fuel companies, they put it in there, and some of them actually have sprayers.
[01:38:26.923 --> 01:38:31.745]  Some of the systems dispersed and aerosolized with the particulate, the nuclei, out of the aircraft.
[01:38:32.065 --> 01:38:38.869]  I mean, it's just like they put sodium fluoride in the water, and it's compartmentalized, and the idiot pouring it in at the water plant, he thinks it's good.
[01:38:39.049 --> 01:38:39.689]  He's not bad.
[01:38:39.989 --> 01:38:42.250]  Like doctors giving people Vioxx, it's killing them.
[01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:42.971]  They think it's good.
[01:38:43.211 --> 01:38:45.512]  Meanwhile, Merck's got hit teams out taking people out.
[01:38:46.092 --> 01:38:48.274]  It's in mainstream federal courts, and nobody cares.
[01:38:48.654 --> 01:38:51.635]  I mean, do you understand the magnitude of the insanity of all this?
[01:38:53.696 --> 01:38:56.658]  And so I have this AP article, and I saw this a year ago.
[01:38:58.059 --> 01:38:59.599]  This is June 11th from yesterday.
[01:39:00.848 --> 01:39:18.954]  But I saw universities debating, previously there were three kinds of clouds, now they're saying there's three or four other new types, and there's these weird little clouds that they say form in trails and have chemicals in them, and they fall on us, and they don't know where they come from, and are space particles coalescing in the atmosphere?
[01:39:19.315 --> 01:39:24.616]  And the scientists can't say it's man-made, so they're going, I don't know, there's new clouds now!
[01:39:26.797 --> 01:39:28.878]  Here's AP right here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:29.915 --> 01:39:34.161]  But to discredit it, they don't focus in on all the scientists, meteorologists, climatologists saying this.
[01:39:34.622 --> 01:39:44.755]  They focus in on a woman's photo and act like there's this big debate in meteorology and climatology and those that are studying hydrology and the ocean.
[01:39:46.328 --> 01:39:46.989]  This is PSYOP.
[01:39:47.009 --> 01:39:50.031]  They make it about a woman who took a photo, so now there's a debate about it.
[01:39:50.231 --> 01:39:51.432]  Because usually they would deny this.
[01:39:51.793 --> 01:39:57.177]  I'm seeing clouds at a thousand feet that are weird chemicals, and they burn your eyes when they hit the ground.
[01:39:57.217 --> 01:39:58.218]  They look like chemical sprays.
[01:39:58.959 --> 01:40:00.880]  You saw an alien, you take photos.
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:02.522]  Oh, you photoshopped that.
[01:40:02.802 --> 01:40:05.764]  You walk outside, they're everywhere, and they're going, that's normal.
[01:40:05.784 --> 01:40:08.427]  You know, it's like body snatchers or something.
[01:40:08.667 --> 01:40:09.427]  Just go to sleep.
[01:40:10.208 --> 01:40:13.050]  That's a metaphor for turning your intellect off and everything will be alright.
[01:40:13.230 --> 01:40:14.171]  Sleep, sleep.
[01:40:15.232 --> 01:40:18.754]  Iowa woman's photo sparks push for new cloud type.
[01:40:19.615 --> 01:40:26.299]  AP, looking out the 11th floor window of her law office, Jane Wiggins, did a double take and grabbed her camera.
[01:40:26.359 --> 01:40:30.882]  The dark undulating clouds hovering outside weren't like anything she'd seen before.
[01:40:31.403 --> 01:40:33.024]  It looked like Armageddon, said Wiggins.
[01:40:34.013 --> 01:40:36.535]  A paralegal and amateur photographer in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
[01:40:36.855 --> 01:40:42.600]  The shadows of the clouds, the lights and the darks, and the greenish-yellow backdrop, they seem to change.
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:44.602]  Yeah, chemical clouds will do that.
[01:40:45.923 --> 01:40:51.227]  First time I ever saw it was a naturally occurring, they didn't do it on purpose, over chemical plants in Houston.
[01:40:51.607 --> 01:40:54.770]  A weird little green cloud at a thousand feet, toxic cloud.
[01:40:57.532 --> 01:40:58.493]  They dispersed.
[01:40:59.639 --> 01:41:11.950]  Disappeared within 15 minutes, but with the photos Wiggins captured in June 2006 intrigue and stopped a group of dedicated weather watchers who were now pushing weather authority to create a new cloud category, something that hasn't been done since 1951.
[01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:19.557]  Breaking into the cloud family would require serving layers of skeptical interviews, reviews.
[01:41:19.717 --> 01:41:20.457]  Still, Gavin
[01:41:22.039 --> 01:41:27.006]  And his England-based Cloud Appreciation Society are determined to establish a new variety.
[01:41:27.387 --> 01:41:31.993]  And he goes on, uh, the new variety, just look at NASA public satellite photos.
[01:41:32.013 --> 01:41:33.976]  In fact, let's pull up the time we have left.
[01:41:33.996 --> 01:41:35.178]  We'll see if we can do it in the last segment.
[01:41:36.499 --> 01:41:41.562]  Google Live NASA Satellite West Coast.
[01:41:42.483 --> 01:41:45.925]  And let's go look at California and see all the lines sprayed.
[01:41:46.745 --> 01:41:48.786]  And then there's meteorology of the whole country.
[01:41:48.927 --> 01:41:49.987]  Everywhere, just lines.
[01:41:50.487 --> 01:41:51.388]  Everywhere, everywhere.
[01:41:52.329 --> 01:41:54.410]  And you'll see a weather front coming in and the planes coming in.
[01:41:55.947 --> 01:41:57.147]  Put it in front of it to block it.
[01:41:57.488 --> 01:42:02.489]  I mean, they're spraying us 24-7, and the White House admits it.
[01:42:02.729 --> 01:42:09.832]  They've gone so far, now there's all these new little green clouds raining things down on us, and they're going, they don't exist.
[01:42:10.712 --> 01:42:12.033]  Anyways, it's just amazing.
[01:42:12.273 --> 01:42:13.093]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:42:13.113 --> 01:42:15.054]  I got some final stuff dealing with the economy.
[01:42:15.834 --> 01:42:18.255]  They're now announcing they're going to officially federalize everything.
[01:42:18.275 --> 01:42:24.797]  9-11 Truth activist sues Glenn Beck and Fox News for defamation.
[01:42:27.506 --> 01:42:32.271]  I don't know if that'll be successful if they have standing, the courts will say, but at least it'll bring attention to him.
[01:42:32.992 --> 01:42:35.074]  So we'll tell you a little bit about that.
[01:42:35.114 --> 01:42:36.575]  Greg Hoover, I'm gonna get him on.
[01:42:37.756 --> 01:42:38.777]  Lindbeck is a monster.
[01:42:38.797 --> 01:42:47.846]  I mean, it would be like saying... Native Americans are saying they love what the shooter of the Jews did.
[01:42:49.059 --> 01:42:50.200]  With no evidence.
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:53.903]  I mean, it is to persecute a minority group, which is becoming a majority.
[01:42:54.804 --> 01:42:56.645]  We'll break all that down on the other side.
[01:42:56.685 --> 01:42:57.486]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:42:58.126 --> 01:42:59.548]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:42:59.648 --> 01:43:00.689]  Stay with us.
[01:43:01.946 --> 01:43:12.032]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:43:12.513 --> 01:43:13.573]  Garden in a can!
[01:43:13.934 --> 01:43:17.516]  Garden in a can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[01:43:18.076 --> 01:43:19.857]  Garden in a can is ready when you are.
[01:43:20.097 --> 01:43:22.379]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[01:43:22.859 --> 01:43:31.924]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[01:43:32.544 --> 01:43:33.544]  Garden in a can.
[01:43:33.965 --> 01:43:34.825]  It's that simple.
[01:43:35.165 --> 01:43:35.465]  Fresh.
[01:43:35.865 --> 01:43:36.246]  Healthy.
[01:43:36.726 --> 01:43:37.026]  Easy.
[01:43:37.566 --> 01:43:41.508]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[01:43:41.908 --> 01:43:42.789]  Ready when you are.

[01:44:01.377 --> 01:44:06.682]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:07.182 --> 01:44:14.208]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:44:14.756 --> 01:44:20.942]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:21.342 --> 01:44:23.184]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:23.324 --> 01:44:25.746]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:44:25.826 --> 01:44:36.776]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:44:37.397 --> 01:44:38.678]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:39.079 --> 01:44:40.420]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:44:40.914 --> 01:44:47.280]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:47.821 --> 01:44:55.629]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:56.089 --> 01:44:57.250]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:57.671 --> 01:44:58.872]  The people strike back.
[01:45:00.708 --> 01:45:05.011]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[01:45:05.232 --> 01:45:07.653]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[01:45:07.794 --> 01:45:17.261]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[01:45:17.261 --> 01:45:17.761]  We're good to go.
[01:45:36.215 --> 01:45:36.775]  I think so.
[01:46:16.111 --> 01:46:22.917]  We're only about $1,000 away, I'm told, from our goal of $250,000 for the June 11th Money Bomb.
[01:46:22.977 --> 01:46:25.399]  And that's what happened last year.
[01:46:25.419 --> 01:46:29.342]  We raised about, I don't know, $190,000, $200,000, and another $50,000 came in the next few days.
[01:46:29.362 --> 01:46:37.889]  So throughout the weekend, if you want to give online at PayPal or Credit Card to expand our operations, if you believe this message is important and want to aid us in this, thank you so much.
[01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:40.051]  That's what Free Will is all about.
[01:46:40.091 --> 01:46:41.673]  We thank you for your support.
[01:46:42.053 --> 01:46:46.877]  InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or link through at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to that page.
[01:46:47.778 --> 01:46:53.602]  And we'll let you know Monday how much above last year's amount we got.
[01:46:53.882 --> 01:46:56.445]  The next year's, I guess, goal will be what this year was.
[01:46:56.805 --> 01:46:58.826]  And just want to thank all of you for your support.
[01:46:58.867 --> 01:47:00.168]  And just spreading the word about the show.
[01:47:01.148 --> 01:47:04.129]  It has really helped, and there'll be some people here on and off during the weekend.
[01:47:04.149 --> 01:47:09.551]  If you want to make a donation over the phone, leave your name and number, and they'll just call you back when they're in, if that's okay.
[01:47:09.571 --> 01:47:12.953]  888-201-2244, but folks are going to be here through this evening.
[01:47:12.973 --> 01:47:16.854]  888-201-2244, and then off and on during the weekend.
[01:47:16.894 --> 01:47:19.035]  My crew's so small, a lot of them need a break.
[01:47:19.055 --> 01:47:19.775]  I've been working a lot.
[01:47:19.795 --> 01:47:21.456]  888-201-2244, or infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[01:47:27.418 --> 01:47:28.960]  Here's another article about drug companies.
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.061]  I have these every five minutes.
[01:47:30.101 --> 01:47:42.635]  Not only was one of the big companies wanting to go around and kill people, but Lilly sold drug for dimension knowing it didn't help file show.
[01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:44.290]  That's out of Bloomberg.
[01:47:44.350 --> 01:47:45.951]  Well, I mean, I'll tell you what's even worse than this.
[01:47:45.971 --> 01:47:49.173]  I mean, Factor VIII, Bayer over a million doses for hemophiliacs.
[01:47:49.193 --> 01:47:51.194]  They knew it had HIV and hepatitis in every shot.
[01:47:51.894 --> 01:47:53.315]  And they knew it and shipped it out.
[01:47:53.815 --> 01:47:54.956]  People say, oh, they're cold-blooded.
[01:47:55.036 --> 01:47:56.137]  No, they're eugenicists.
[01:47:56.237 --> 01:47:57.777]  Bayer was actually run by the Nazis.
[01:47:58.958 --> 01:48:01.459]  So, you better learn, folks, this is all about eugenics.
[01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:02.840]  And these people mean...
[01:48:06.966 --> 01:48:24.484]  mean very very serious business so we certainly continue to look into that and here's another one uh... obama has introduced more than ten big bills that basically in the second as we know it and then as these bills move through congress he denies he wants your guns here's world that daily obama
[01:48:26.795 --> 01:48:28.977]  Eliminate 8 out of 10 pocket knives.
[01:48:29.117 --> 01:48:32.099]  If this were to pass, you could not cross a state line with one.
[01:48:32.199 --> 01:48:33.120]  It would be a felony.
[01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:33.940]  The U.S.
[01:48:33.981 --> 01:48:41.606]  Customs and Border Protection Agency is proposing a new definition that would be used to eliminate 8 of 10 legal pocket knives in the United States right now.
[01:48:41.626 --> 01:48:46.990]  According to activists who are gearing up to fight the plan, the federal bureaucracy is accepting comments.
[01:48:47.831 --> 01:48:52.775]  So now when you go to an airport and the thing's half an inch long, now you'll go to prison for it.
[01:48:54.246 --> 01:48:55.947]  Well, they love putting the slaves in prison.
[01:48:56.888 --> 01:48:57.368]  Big business!
[01:48:57.388 --> 01:48:58.409]  That's what America is now.
[01:48:58.769 --> 01:49:10.118]  The federal bureaucracy is accepting comments written only that must be received by June 21st before its planned changes would become final, said Doug Ritter of kniferights.org.
[01:49:10.158 --> 01:49:10.818]  Let's get him on.
[01:49:11.119 --> 01:49:18.504]  So the implications of the decision would be far-reaching since many state and federal agencies depend on the agency definitions to determine what is legal in the United States.
[01:49:19.005 --> 01:49:21.446]  So you're trying to drive back in from Mexico or Canada with your RV
[01:49:22.327 --> 01:49:24.449]  Now you're going to be arrested for having steak knives.
[01:49:25.569 --> 01:49:29.852]  England's trying to restrict knives now in your house and have a license to have a butcher knife.
[01:49:30.273 --> 01:49:31.493]  This is the enslavement.
[01:49:31.814 --> 01:49:33.114]  This is what's happening.
[01:49:33.615 --> 01:49:34.756]  And it's totally disgusting.
[01:49:34.896 --> 01:49:36.697]  And people keep calling me saying, where's the article?
[01:49:37.277 --> 01:49:40.479]  CBS News, PATH stations to run security screening tests.
[01:49:41.620 --> 01:49:44.922]  to use cutting-edge passive millimeter wave technology.
[01:49:44.962 --> 01:49:53.328]  Another article in the AP says everyone that rides the trains and the subways in Boston and New York and then nationwide later, this is a test, will be searched.
[01:49:53.648 --> 01:49:56.590]  The millimeter wave system scans your naked body.
[01:49:56.750 --> 01:49:57.391]  An image of it.
[01:49:57.771 --> 01:49:59.992]  There is CBS News on that.
[01:50:00.072 --> 01:50:03.655]  So not just the airports now, but the naked body scanners are going to go in everywhere.
[01:50:03.695 --> 01:50:07.677]  And the FBI has said they want to put these in shopping malls.
[01:50:08.178 --> 01:50:08.538]  Talk about 1984.
[01:50:10.419 --> 01:50:14.300]  But now, if you don't like Big Brother, you're some kind of Al-Qaeda operative or something.
[01:50:15.601 --> 01:50:26.904]  Again, from the bottom of my heart, from my very soul, I want to thank all of you for spreading the word and standing behind us and defending us from all the false attacks by the mainstream media and the establishment and the COINTELPRO operatives.
[01:50:28.174 --> 01:50:30.996]  And I want to thank all of you for supporting us with the InfoWars Money Bomb.
[01:50:31.396 --> 01:50:33.258]  It's not too likely to be part of this historical event.
[01:50:34.098 --> 01:50:36.139]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, with Jason Bermas.
[01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:37.020]  I'll be sitting in with him.
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:38.181]  God bless you all.
[01:50:38.201 --> 01:50:39.362]  See you back this Sunday, 2, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:50:39.382 --> 01:50:41.083]  live on the syndicated transmission.
[01:50:41.103 --> 01:50:42.564]  Take care.
[01:50:42.604 --> 01:50:43.945]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:43.985 --> 01:50:49.128]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:51.684 --> 01:50:56.647]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:51:21.704 --> 01:51:22.324]  We're good.
