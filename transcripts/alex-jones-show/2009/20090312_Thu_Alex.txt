[00:00:19.842 --> 00:00:21.903]  Starve or surrender.
[00:00:21.923 --> 00:00:26.125]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.

[00:01:07.316 --> 00:01:12.660]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.384]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:01:19.684 --> 00:01:21.505]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:24.047]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:01:24.127 --> 00:01:35.014]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.

[00:03:03.885 --> 00:03:15.694]  Yeah, the establishment's going crazy on us, saying that people that own gold, people that own guns, people that talk about the Constitution, people that support Bob Barr, Ron Paul, Constitution Party, Libertarian Party, they're terrorists that want to kill cops.
[00:03:17.135 --> 00:03:22.640]  This is to demonize the true threat to the New World Order that is the American people.
[00:03:28.234 --> 00:03:29.855]  We've got right on our side.
[00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:30.935]  We know the truth.
[00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:32.316]  We've been right about everything.
[00:03:32.576 --> 00:03:33.396]  We're laying it out.
[00:03:33.457 --> 00:03:35.237]  The people are rallying and waking up.
[00:03:36.518 --> 00:03:38.579]  And the Obama deception has dropped.
[00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:40.740]  It is now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:44.542]  God bless all of you out there taking action.
[00:03:47.303 --> 00:03:53.466]  Before the show ends, I'm going to go through some more, line by line, of them saying we're all terrorists.
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:02.587]  Yeah, well the founders said that when you attack the Bill of Rights, Constitution, and the American people, that you are the treasonous traitors.
[00:04:04.428 --> 00:04:06.550]  But we're getting this from the police, so they don't like it either.
[00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.492]  I mean, it's getting a little too obvious.
[00:04:11.034 --> 00:04:13.977]  You know, I kept telling him on the phone, I said, no, it says Ron Paul.
[00:04:13.997 --> 00:04:14.638]  And he goes, no, it doesn't.
[00:04:14.718 --> 00:04:16.279]  I'm like, what do you think, I'm making this up?
[00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.900]  It says Ron Paul.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.141]  And he goes, oh my gosh, it does say it.
[00:04:18.922 --> 00:04:19.922]  On the next to last page.
[00:04:20.998 --> 00:04:23.040]  All right, let's jam in some calls very quickly here.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.680]  I love hearing from you.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.702]  We've got a guest coming up and a bunch of other stuff to cover.
[00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:27.644]  And I've got the Cy Hirsch news I've got to cover.
[00:04:28.645 --> 00:04:30.887]  That's coming up right before the doctor joins us.
[00:04:31.047 --> 00:04:33.068]  Let's go to Cliff in Oklahoma.
[00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:35.851]  You are on the air, and are you a terrorist because you love freedom, sir?
[00:04:36.692 --> 00:04:44.498]  Well, apparently I am, Alex, because I just got pulled over by a cop a couple of nights ago, and I think you need to hear this story.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.163]  I like to put Liberty Stickers on the back of my car on LibertyStickers.com.
[00:04:58.046 --> 00:04:59.127]  I'll try to go easy on you.
[00:05:00.527 --> 00:05:02.648]  No, but I have a few different stickers.
[00:05:02.708 --> 00:05:11.173]  One that says I support Ron Paul and another one that says I do not consent to being searched, you know, per se, to the Fourth Amendment.
[00:05:13.288 --> 00:05:22.935]  Anyways, um, I'm driving through this construction zone, speed, speed trap, going up to Edmond, which is home of Police Chief Bob O'Rex from Waco fame.
[00:05:24.016 --> 00:05:41.629]  And, uh, anyways, um, I, I get pulled over, and, uh, cop comes up to my window, and, uh, you know, it's kind of weird because I was following the flow of traffic, everybody else is going as fast as I am, uh, and he follows me for about half a minute before he even turns the siren on.
[00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:43.342]  And I pull over.
[00:05:43.362 --> 00:05:44.363]  He comes in.
[00:05:44.423 --> 00:05:46.764]  I give him my license and registration.
[00:05:46.784 --> 00:05:47.824]  He's got the window rolled down.
[00:05:48.804 --> 00:05:51.905]  And I say, what am I, you know, what was it I did, officer?
[00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:53.886]  And he tells me I was speeding.
[00:05:53.966 --> 00:05:59.768]  And I, you know, just question the fact that I had multiple cars beside me that were going the same speed.
[00:06:00.188 --> 00:06:06.510]  Well, then he tells me, right after I say that, he says, all right, get out of the car right now.
[00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.432]  And I said, am I being detained, officer?
[00:06:11.052 --> 00:06:11.552]  And he goes,
[00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.731]  Uh, he goes, out of the car right now!
[00:06:14.052 --> 00:06:15.972]  And I'm just like, I'm just asking you a question.
[00:06:16.052 --> 00:06:16.932]  Am I being detained?
[00:06:17.372 --> 00:06:19.393]  And then he says, get out of the car and take further action.
[00:06:19.413 --> 00:06:22.354]  Well, I went ahead and got out after that point.
[00:06:22.934 --> 00:06:26.975]  And I, you know, I rolled my window up, I locked my doors and everything.
[00:06:27.355 --> 00:06:29.995]  I get out and I say, officer, I just need to ask you a question.
[00:06:30.035 --> 00:06:31.356]  Why, if I'm being detained or not?
[00:06:31.776 --> 00:06:33.936]  Well, then he says, get in my car right now.
[00:06:34.036 --> 00:06:37.037]  I thought he was saying, get in his back seat or he's going to arrest me or something.
[00:06:37.077 --> 00:06:40.198]  Well, he had me get in the front seat of his car and as I'm getting in the car,
[00:06:40.717 --> 00:06:49.880]  He slams the door real hard and it closes in on my body as I'm getting into the car so it slams so hard it knocked me into the rest of the car basically.
[00:06:51.601 --> 00:06:53.982]  He wanted to get you out from in front of the camera.
[00:06:54.022 --> 00:06:57.223]  He wanted to abuse you when the squad car camera wasn't on you.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:04.905]  Exactly, and I want to stress that while I was talking to him, I did not start freaking out or anything.
[00:07:04.945 --> 00:07:06.105]  No, I understand you're not allowed to.
[00:07:06.145 --> 00:07:11.489]  He was about to taser you if you hadn't got out, and then you're not allowed to talk to him, because you're a terrorist.
[00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:12.410]  You've got a Ron Paul sticker.
[00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.050]  Please continue.
[00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:22.857]  Okay, so anyways, I'm in the car, and he gets in, and he says, you disobeyed my orders to get out of the car.
[00:07:23.337 --> 00:07:27.320]  I said, all I want to know is why I'm being detained, and I told him, I said,
[00:07:28.428 --> 00:07:31.869]  I said, officer, what you just did, slamming into the car like that.
[00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:35.329]  I didn't slam into the car.
[00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:38.150]  He slammed the door into me as I was getting in the car.
[00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:43.271]  I said, what you did could qualify as assault or excessive force on me.
[00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:47.011]  I've been cooperating with you and I just asked you a question.
[00:07:48.512 --> 00:07:51.552]  He starts saying, listen, I know what the Supreme Court says.
[00:07:52.212 --> 00:07:55.373]  I don't need your junior high argument or your bumper sticker argument.
[00:07:57.991 --> 00:08:00.873]  I mean, like, right there, that was like profiling to me.
[00:08:01.233 --> 00:08:01.893]  So how did he know?
[00:08:01.933 --> 00:08:10.217]  He's letting you know, it's the bumper sticker, you don't, the Fourth Amendment is like Satanism to him, so America is bad, so what happens next?
[00:08:11.458 --> 00:08:22.323]  So anyway, he starts lecturing me about having, you know, broken the speed limit, which yeah, I probably was going faster when I first entered that construction zone.
[00:08:23.038 --> 00:08:26.179]  But, um, so we're, uh, three or four other cars right ahead of me.
[00:08:26.459 --> 00:08:29.920]  No, no, the speed trams are done like that by design, but, uh, so how did this end?
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.681]  Well, anyways, uh, anyway, I thought he was going to search my car.
[00:08:33.741 --> 00:08:47.044]  I've, I've had problems with these Edmund cops before, uh, and I, I derived it to their wonderful police chief, but, um, anyway, he starts writing me the ticket and he continues to tell me about how I didn't cooperate with him and everything.
[00:08:47.566 --> 00:08:52.029]  And I wasn't going to just let him walk all over me, and I kept on talking to him.
[00:08:52.069 --> 00:08:55.130]  I said, you know, I was just asking you a question.
[00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.491]  I didn't delay anything.
[00:08:56.551 --> 00:08:59.473]  I made no shifty movements to make you feel that I was a threat to you.
[00:08:59.713 --> 00:09:02.895]  I got out of the car, you know, after you started screaming at me.
[00:09:03.435 --> 00:09:06.176]  And so you write the ticket, and he goes, get out of here.
[00:09:06.417 --> 00:09:07.597]  And that was it.
[00:09:07.657 --> 00:09:08.458]  I was really shocked.
[00:09:08.658 --> 00:09:10.779]  I mean, I was scared that he was going to do something.
[00:09:11.226 --> 00:09:17.751]  But just the fact that he, I feel that I was profiled, that he wouldn't allow me to ask him... No, no, that's the issue.
[00:09:17.951 --> 00:09:18.932]  That should be the headline.
[00:09:19.313 --> 00:09:29.561]  Ron Paul, libertarians, gold owners, gun owners were being profiled because they tell the cops that we're a danger to them and that we may kill them.
[00:09:29.601 --> 00:09:32.663]  And they give them all this propaganda and it's a load of bull.
[00:09:33.669 --> 00:09:34.310]  You know, it isn't clear.
[00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.054]  I mean, they won't tell them that the illegal aliens, statistically, are the real ones killing them.
[00:09:38.354 --> 00:09:39.776]  No, it's gotta be Americans.
[00:09:39.836 --> 00:09:40.677]  We've gotta pay.
[00:09:40.757 --> 00:09:41.698]  We've gotta be taught.
[00:09:42.018 --> 00:09:43.180]  Sir, I appreciate your call.
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:51.008]  Now, see, I got all these callers, and I just spent five, six minutes with Cliff, but I had to, and I want to get to Simon, Justin, Joe, Susie, and others.
[00:09:51.048 --> 00:09:52.930]  We've got Dr. Carley coming up.
[00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:53.892]  Oh, man.
[00:09:56.394 --> 00:09:57.595]  It's all just crazy in here.
[00:09:57.615 --> 00:10:01.899]  This bird flu thing, I mean this is serious.
[00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:04.361]  We need to have a part two on this and expand on it.
[00:10:05.578 --> 00:10:07.038]  Get some other news in as we cover it.
[00:10:07.078 --> 00:10:12.940]  Before we go, Dr. Carley, and then your calls, Hirsch, Cheney-ran SS-style political assassination unit.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.180]  This is up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.301]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:10:17.861 --> 00:10:25.443]  Award-winning investigative reporter Seymour Hirsch dropped another bombshell this week when he revealed that the former... This guy's always been proven to be 100% accurate.
[00:10:25.463 --> 00:10:26.343]  Hirsch is just incredible.
[00:10:26.383 --> 00:10:30.524]  He broke the torture camps in Vietnam in the early seventies.
[00:10:30.584 --> 00:10:31.024]  I mean, it's just...
[00:10:31.784 --> 00:10:38.488]  You know, that they lied about WMDs, that they were staging terror attacks inside Iran using Al-Qaeda, because Iran is Shiite, their archenemy.
[00:10:38.788 --> 00:10:42.831]  Now that's all mainstream news, that Cheney wanted to stage terror attacks against U.S.
[00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:44.012]  ships and blame it on Al-Qaeda.
[00:10:44.212 --> 00:10:45.293]  That's confirmed!
[00:10:45.733 --> 00:10:47.174]  That's mainstream news!
[00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:51.161]  I told John Gibson that on Fox yesterday, and he just laughs at me.
[00:10:51.621 --> 00:10:52.122]  Oh, sure!
[00:10:53.023 --> 00:10:54.263]  More conspiracy theories!
[00:10:55.865 --> 00:11:09.315]  This is New Yorker Magazine writer, Pulitzer Prize winner, award-winning investigative reporter Seymour Hersh dropped another bombshell this week when he revealed that former Vice President Dick Cheney had his own SS-style political assassination unit that reported directly to him.
[00:11:10.851 --> 00:11:21.760]  First told University of Minnesota audience Tuesday after 9-11, I haven't written about this yet, but the Central Intelligence Agency was very deeply involved in domestic activities against people they thought to be enemies of the state.
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.322]  Without any legal authority for it, they weren't
[00:11:26.431 --> 00:11:27.753]  They haven't been called on it yet.
[00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:30.636]  So that's people inside the United States with the CIA.
[00:11:30.656 --> 00:11:32.358]  Well, yeah, they're setting up local offices of it.
[00:11:32.899 --> 00:11:34.380]  And hiring every ne'er-do-well you can imagine.
[00:11:34.921 --> 00:11:42.911]  Hirsch then went on to describe how the Joint Special Operations Command was an executive assassination unit that carried out political assassinations abroad.
[00:11:44.167 --> 00:11:49.570]  It is a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently, he explained.
[00:11:49.811 --> 00:11:54.814]  They do not report to anybody except in the Bush-Cheney days, they're reported directly to Cheney's office.
[00:11:55.174 --> 00:11:56.715]  Congress has no oversight over it.
[00:11:58.456 --> 00:12:01.778]  Guys, I meant to call Paul when I saw he'd written this article this morning.
[00:12:01.818 --> 00:12:02.819]  I saw it break last night.
[00:12:02.839 --> 00:12:05.600]  He gave a speech last night to the university.
[00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:08.102]  We've been in contact with Hirsch.
[00:12:08.142 --> 00:12:09.583]  We talked to him again yesterday.
[00:12:11.468 --> 00:12:14.869]  And he keeps saying to come on and break something big here and he likes us and knows who we are.
[00:12:14.889 --> 00:12:15.870]  Okay, well I'm ready, Hirsh.
[00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:16.170]  I'm ready.
[00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:17.090]  I've been waiting six months.
[00:12:21.872 --> 00:12:22.513]  He's a really nice guy.
[00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:25.034]  You can call him up on the phone, but I can't get him on the show.
[00:12:31.396 --> 00:12:32.237]  It goes on here.
[00:12:34.022 --> 00:12:40.143]  What I want you guys to Google, and this is from six years ago, so let me think of the exact headline.
[00:12:40.283 --> 00:12:42.304]  UPI first broke it, then Reuters reported it.
[00:12:43.204 --> 00:12:48.185]  Headline, Israel to carry out assassinations inside the United States.
[00:12:48.285 --> 00:12:48.665]  Google that.
[00:12:48.785 --> 00:12:52.066]  Israel to carry out assassinations inside the United States.
[00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:53.786]  Israel to carry out assassinations inside the United States.
[00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:55.726]  That should have been added to this, but I know they didn't think of that.
[00:12:55.966 --> 00:12:58.567]  That's what I do, I think of all the little angles and past things.
[00:12:58.627 --> 00:12:59.147]  So do the guys.
[00:13:00.452 --> 00:13:02.374]  A lot of times I contribute behind the scenes of the articles.
[00:13:02.974 --> 00:13:07.238]  Just to point out that this is announced that foreign governments are allowed to come here and kill U.S.
[00:13:07.258 --> 00:13:08.900]  citizens.
[00:13:13.284 --> 00:13:18.569]  Revelation that Cheney had his own private assassination unit is not too far removed from Hitler's notorious essay.
[00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.933]  The much feared paramilitary wing of the Nazi party who were
[00:13:24.056 --> 00:13:28.198]  Who used to beat, torture and kill political opponents of the Nazi Party in the 30s.
[00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:33.521]  Germany and the Waffen-SS who were later used in the war to carry out executions and war crimes.
[00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:41.806]  The SA were later targeted by Hitler during the Night of the Long Knives, a brutal purge to eliminate political adversaries both inside and outside the Nazi Party.
[00:13:41.886 --> 00:13:45.087]  Hundreds of people were executed in cold blood by the Gestapo and the SS.
[00:13:46.428 --> 00:13:47.189]  Try millions.
[00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:57.700]  Tellingly, German courts and cabinets quickly swept aside centuries of legal prohibition against extrajudicial killings to demonstrate their loyalty to Hitler.
[00:13:57.941 --> 00:14:07.251]  The Waffen-SS, which means armed FS, was deemed beyond prosecution despite it blatantly being involved in egregious and ongoing war crimes as well as domestic assassinations.
[00:14:07.751 --> 00:14:14.817]  The Joint Special Operations Command, Cheney's assassination unit, is also described as a extra-legal operations.
[00:14:14.997 --> 00:14:19.781]  It is an executive assassination ring, and it has been going on and on and on, Hearst stated.
[00:14:20.081 --> 00:14:29.589]  Under President Bush's authority, they've been going into countries, not talking to the ambassador, the CIA station chief, and funding, and finding people on a list, and executing them, and leaving.
[00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.352]  That's been going on in the name of all of us.
[00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:33.913]  And it's still going on.
[00:14:33.973 --> 00:14:34.614]  None of Obama's
[00:14:36.024 --> 00:14:40.448]  Reversals of Bush's executive order say anything about abolishing the Joint Special Forces Command.
[00:14:40.868 --> 00:14:48.976]  Indeed, the specialist unit is an integral part of Obama's vastly expanding bombing raids and other incursions into Pakistan.
[00:14:49.396 --> 00:14:58.965]  Let's go ahead now and play the clip that Oberman played last night from Hirsch yesterday before a university audience.
[00:14:58.985 --> 00:14:59.686]  Here's the audio.
[00:15:01.173 --> 00:15:10.777]  The defenders of Bush's ghost may have more to worry about tomorrow and in the near future than the relative records of Bush and Obama on signing statements and on Saddam Hussein and everything else.
[00:15:11.257 --> 00:15:13.278]  Cheney assassination squads.
[00:15:13.838 --> 00:15:15.398]  What does that mean?
[00:15:15.538 --> 00:15:16.959]  Cheney assassination squads?
[00:15:17.299 --> 00:15:20.203]  An amazing thing happened in Minnesota last night.
[00:15:20.223 --> 00:15:25.530]  There was a forum with the investigative reporter Seymour Hersh and former Vice President Walter Mondale.
[00:15:25.911 --> 00:15:33.581]  And in the Q&A session, Hersh let slip that he's working on a book that will include reporting about
[00:15:34.222 --> 00:15:50.380]  Cheney-sponsored assassination rings, as Hirsch put it, that went around the local CIA station chiefs abroad to carry out assassinations on targets using apparently military
[00:15:51.061 --> 00:16:20.562]  personnel now obviously uh... that's very sketchy we need to know a lot more about it um... i think hersh is gonna wanna make us wait until his book comes out but clearly there's a lot more that happened in that in that bush administration directly out of the vice president's office that we don't know about yet and that keith will curl our hair well now we know what happened when he shot uh... henry whittington or harry whittington at the price alright guys we also have a clip from the university don't we?
[00:16:21.718 --> 00:16:22.638]  We have an audio clip of that?
[00:16:23.139 --> 00:16:24.940]  Okay, that's the clip I thought we were going to.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.500]  Let's go to that in just a moment.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.201]  We'll go to our guest in the next segment.
[00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:30.162]  I apologize, Eric, but this must be covered.
[00:16:30.902 --> 00:16:34.244]  It came out two weeks ago.
[00:16:34.264 --> 00:16:46.790]  The memos were released saying that they were going to set up a dictatorship and the President was basically above all laws and Congress and that they could ban and arrest press and shut down free speech in America.
[00:16:47.932 --> 00:16:52.214]  And they tell the CIA and FBI to be involved in this, and they go, oh absolutely, we love it!
[00:16:52.474 --> 00:16:53.555]  That's what freedom is!
[00:16:54.035 --> 00:16:56.056]  Secret arrest, secret camp, secret police!
[00:16:56.457 --> 00:17:04.421]  Then they grab these Al-Qaeda people, who are just minions, and they hold them for seven years with torture, and then release a press release where they confess.
[00:17:04.701 --> 00:17:06.762]  They've been caught putting out fake confessions before.
[00:17:06.782 --> 00:17:11.304]  You know, where is the talk of bringing Dick Cheney to justice?
[00:17:11.344 --> 00:17:14.346]  Where is the talk of bringing Rumsfeld and Bush to justice?
[00:17:14.646 --> 00:17:15.787]  Nothing from Obama!
[00:17:17.884 --> 00:17:21.305]  And I just remembered, I didn't even put that in the Obama Deception.
[00:17:21.345 --> 00:17:23.686]  I'm not poo-pooing my own film, but let me write a note right now.
[00:17:23.726 --> 00:17:24.526]  Can somebody give me a pen?
[00:17:24.546 --> 00:17:27.387]  Because I'm going to go ahead in the next two weeks and put out Obama Deception 1.5.
[00:17:27.467 --> 00:17:33.269]  And I'm just going to, down and dirty, sit down in the studio, go over the facts of that.
[00:17:33.349 --> 00:17:35.850]  That's the big one I didn't put in the film, because you can't put it all!
[00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:42.292]  He's now, well I did put in there that he's protecting Bush, and that he's supporting torture and blocking investigations of him.
[00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:44.213]  We do cover it, but I want to get more into that.
[00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.611]  Protecting Bush.
[00:17:48.071 --> 00:17:48.771]  What am I doing?
[00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:52.613]  And continuing all of the programs.
[00:17:54.233 --> 00:17:55.454]  And people think we exaggerate.
[00:17:55.514 --> 00:17:56.574]  No, there's no way!
[00:17:56.634 --> 00:18:02.116]  You want to read this 8-page report the feds put out to the state police around the country.
[00:18:03.136 --> 00:18:04.337]  With the governor's seal in Missouri.
[00:18:04.357 --> 00:18:05.057]  That's just one version.
[00:18:05.097 --> 00:18:07.498]  We got some California stuff right here too.
[00:18:13.188 --> 00:18:15.230]  To read this, it's worse than I'm saying.
[00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.052]  You've got to go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:18:19.813 --> 00:18:29.881]  I know Paul said he was writing another more detailed story, just Kurt rushed this out quickly and did a great job and linked the report, but let me just see if that's up on PrisonPlanet.com yet.
[00:18:31.222 --> 00:18:33.624]  Go to the main page of that while it's loading.
[00:18:37.146 --> 00:18:40.009]  Ron Paul, culprits of financial collapse should be arrested.
[00:18:40.965 --> 00:18:44.508]  That's a good story I asked him to do from his interview with us a few days ago.
[00:18:44.608 --> 00:18:47.029]  Hirsch, Cheney, Rent-Esses, Stop Political Assassination Unit.
[00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:50.652]  Hope, Change, Progress, and the Obama Deception.
[00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:53.414]  So I guess he's still working on it.
[00:18:53.454 --> 00:18:57.316]  Secret Police Report, Ron Paul, Bob Barr, Chuck Baldwin, Libertarians or Terrorists.
[00:18:57.416 --> 00:18:59.638]  That's Kurt Nemo's story.
[00:18:59.718 --> 00:19:03.681]  So I guess Paul's doing a more detailed one tying it into everything.
[00:19:04.641 --> 00:19:08.284]  But just mind-blowing.
[00:19:10.271 --> 00:19:11.512]  Absolutely mind-blowing.
[00:19:11.672 --> 00:19:19.539]  But yeah, Obama 1.5 will be all the interviews with Tarpley, Jesse Ventura, George Humphrey, all the things we couldn't add in the just-under-two-hour film.
[00:19:19.559 --> 00:19:27.847]  It's an hour and twelve minutes, eight minutes under two hours, and there's thirty minutes of extras, but those are going up tomorrow at PrisonPlanet.tv and shipping out on the DVDs next week, next Monday.
[00:19:28.928 --> 00:19:33.913]  But again, I cannot stress enough that the Obama deception shatters the left-right paradigm.
[00:19:33.933 --> 00:19:40.219]  That means when you show a Democrat this, it doesn't come out with a right-wing, mainline view, so they shut off thinking process.
[00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:42.901]  This is what can get through to them so they can see they're being deceived.
[00:19:43.462 --> 00:19:47.748]  Remember all those poor Bush people who we couldn't wake up because, like, you're a commie, you don't like Bush.
[00:19:47.768 --> 00:19:49.531]  I'm like, no, Bush is crippling the size of government.
[00:19:49.551 --> 00:19:51.714]  He's saying he's setting up a dictatorship.
[00:19:51.794 --> 00:19:52.675]  No, he's not!
[00:19:53.236 --> 00:19:54.838]  And now they're like, well, look, Bush left office.
[00:19:54.878 --> 00:19:56.040]  We told you he was going to do that.
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:00.085]  It's the office that has the dictatorial power that the private interest control.
[00:20:01.775 --> 00:20:04.959]  So again, please go to Infowars.com and pre-order the DVD.
[00:20:04.999 --> 00:20:05.940]  It ships out next week.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.442]  Please get the high quality.
[00:20:07.482 --> 00:20:10.706]  That's how this masterpiece needs to be seen is on the DVD.
[00:20:10.746 --> 00:20:16.593]  That's how it needs to be made copies, but it looks pretty darn good at PrisonPlanet.tv compared to other stuff I see on the web.
[00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:17.695]  It's really crisp and nice.
[00:20:19.611 --> 00:20:30.180]  And I want folks to get PrisonPlanet.tv memberships because you get the couple hours a day I do here, sometimes the whole show, sometimes an hour, but always over, on average a week, every two hours a day on average.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.543]  Burmese does all three hours, 9 to midnight, live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:33.963 --> 00:20:35.724]  All my films, special reports.
[00:20:37.045 --> 00:20:40.228]  Obama 1.5 will only be for PrisonPlanet.tv folks.
[00:20:41.069 --> 00:20:42.110]  So that's where it'll be first.
[00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:43.691]  And it's in high quality.
[00:20:43.751 --> 00:20:47.634]  So these are DivX copies, you can burn the disc that then plays in DVD players.
[00:20:48.815 --> 00:20:52.579]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, order the films, order the materials.
[00:20:52.619 --> 00:20:55.682]  TheObamaDeception.net has all the trailers and sneak peeks.
[00:20:56.603 --> 00:20:57.364]  They're in one spot.
[00:20:58.405 --> 00:20:58.785]  Stay with us.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:12.561]  brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as savior.
[00:21:12.801 --> 00:21:14.202]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:21:14.422 --> 00:21:18.323]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:21:18.583 --> 00:21:22.164]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:21:22.404 --> 00:21:26.505]  The insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:30.866]  Phase one is a one world currency which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[00:21:31.206 --> 00:21:32.466]  Phase two of their insidious
[00:21:36.454 --> 00:21:37.375]  That's right.
[00:22:00.899 --> 00:22:06.208]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:06.729 --> 00:22:13.742]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:22:14.292 --> 00:22:20.474]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:20.874 --> 00:22:22.694]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:22.854 --> 00:22:25.255]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:25.335 --> 00:22:36.278]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:22:36.918 --> 00:22:38.198]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:38.599 --> 00:22:39.959]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:22:40.453 --> 00:22:46.754]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:47.354 --> 00:22:55.136]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:55.616 --> 00:22:56.756]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:57.196 --> 00:22:58.456]  The people strike back.
[00:23:01.917 --> 00:23:03.897]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[00:23:04.497 --> 00:23:06.958]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[00:23:07.569 --> 00:23:11.745]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[00:23:12.495 --> 00:23:14.257]  You know that you need to prepare.
[00:23:14.617 --> 00:23:17.640]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.003]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[00:23:21.323 --> 00:23:32.713]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds and survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[00:23:33.094 --> 00:23:38.899]  Imagine growing your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass, fruits, herbs, rice, tea, coffee,
[00:23:38.919 --> 00:23:40.520]  He's going the distance!
[00:24:22.885 --> 00:24:23.665]  Yeah!
[00:24:27.547 --> 00:24:28.428]  Go in the distance.
[00:24:28.448 --> 00:24:29.228]  That's what it's all about.
[00:24:29.468 --> 00:24:30.148]  Showing up.
[00:24:30.289 --> 00:24:31.069]  Fighting back.
[00:24:31.589 --> 00:24:33.330]  Standing up and not being cowards.
[00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:34.330]  And I know you're not doing that.
[00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:34.731]  I love you.
[00:24:47.407 --> 00:24:48.847]  Haha, look at who's in there.
[00:24:48.887 --> 00:24:50.808]  He's going, look at this idiot Alex acting stupid.
[00:24:50.868 --> 00:24:51.968]  That's what it's all about, bro.
[00:24:52.108 --> 00:24:53.128]  I'm just joking.
[00:25:17.285 --> 00:25:20.469]  Uh, let's go to Dr. Rebecca Carley for the rest of this hour and the whole of the next hour.
[00:25:20.489 --> 00:25:25.874]  We'll open the phones up in about 30 minutes for everybody holding in on the issue of the bird flu.
[00:25:25.894 --> 00:25:28.677]  Dr. Rebecca Carley is a medical doctor, a surgeon by trade.
[00:25:28.697 --> 00:25:30.319]  Her son got vaccine damage.
[00:25:30.359 --> 00:25:31.500]  She began to investigate it.
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:35.824]  And I think some of her research is some of the best I've seen out there because I've done a lot of this research myself.
[00:25:36.545 --> 00:25:37.505]  And I appreciate the opportunity.
[00:25:37.525 --> 00:25:40.827]  And before we get into that, I was listening to your show earlier talking about the Alabama shooter.
[00:26:02.822 --> 00:26:07.403]  I totally agree with you that he was most likely on Prozac or some other psychotropic med.
[00:26:07.723 --> 00:26:09.164]  Well, it's coming out the German!
[00:26:09.244 --> 00:26:13.025]  It's coming out the German was under psychiatric care, so he's guaranteed on it, but go ahead.
[00:26:13.265 --> 00:26:17.686]  Right, I just want to bring out the fact that vaccinations can also cause violent behavior.
[00:26:18.006 --> 00:26:25.588]  There's an excellent book entitled Vaccination, Social Violence, and Criminality by Harris Colter, which the listeners can obtain from thinktwice.com.
[00:26:25.968 --> 00:26:30.349]  And there's certain areas of the brain that in fact lead you to become violent.
[00:26:30.777 --> 00:26:41.893]  I have in front of me a book published by NATO, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, called The Biology of Aggression, which is, let's see, it's over 600 pages long.
[00:26:41.913 --> 00:26:45.819]  They're actually researching to see what areas of the brain they can affect.
[00:26:46.155 --> 00:26:50.056]  To make people violent, and they're using rabies virus to do so.
[00:26:50.196 --> 00:27:14.105]  Yes, now doctor, I've read the medical, major university and medical facility reports, but for those that don't know why it causes it, or the brain damage, normally it is an autoimmune response, massive brain swelling, and as we all know, brain damage is associated with violent outbursts and a loss of impulse control, and of course there's other chemical reasons it does it, but is that not basically the main reason?
[00:27:14.645 --> 00:27:16.007]  Yes, that's completely correct.
[00:27:16.307 --> 00:27:27.059]  Once you get injected with viruses, if they go to your brain, they cause vaccine-induced encephalitis, and depending on what part of the brain is damaged will determine what symptoms you have.
[00:27:27.421 --> 00:27:35.625]  The parts of the brain that control behavior and make you violent are primarily the limbic system, especially the amygdala, which is near the ear.
[00:27:36.005 --> 00:27:46.491]  And by the way, Dr. Russell Blaylock, who is a top brain surgeon, even invented some famous brain procedures, one of the top guys in the world, he discovered all this in his practice.
[00:27:47.171 --> 00:27:50.273]  Okay, how vaccines literally attack the brain.
[00:27:50.293 --> 00:27:50.713]  Go ahead.
[00:27:51.213 --> 00:27:51.973]  Yes, exactly.
[00:27:52.033 --> 00:27:53.134]  This has been known for years.
[00:27:53.697 --> 00:27:58.482]  But the point I want to make is that the scientists are actually researching how to make people violent.
[00:27:58.762 --> 00:28:00.704]  This is something that they want to have happen.
[00:28:01.044 --> 00:28:11.735]  I encourage all the listeners to watch the movie recently released on DVD entitled Quarantine, which actually shows them experimenting with rabies and making the people become basically ghouls.
[00:28:12.175 --> 00:28:14.518]  So this is more evil than you can even imagine.
[00:28:16.033 --> 00:28:16.573]  Absolutely.
[00:28:16.613 --> 00:28:16.993]  Stay there.
[00:28:17.053 --> 00:28:19.675]  Back in 70 seconds, Dr. Rebecca Carley.
[00:28:19.995 --> 00:28:23.336]  Give out your website and a lot more, and then I'm just going to try to control myself.
[00:28:23.356 --> 00:28:25.557]  I just want to back up everything you're saying, because I know it's true.
[00:28:25.957 --> 00:28:36.621]  Then let's just walk through the vaccine history, what we're dealing with, how devastating this bird flu situation being, where they're trying to mix it with vaccines, could have been over in Europe and 18 nations.
[00:28:37.041 --> 00:28:37.522]  Stay with us.
[00:28:37.542 --> 00:28:38.182]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:38.202 --> 00:28:43.084]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:28:46.147 --> 00:28:48.409]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:28:50.431 --> 00:28:51.011]  Hello, friends.
[00:28:51.051 --> 00:28:51.992]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:28:52.132 --> 00:28:56.736]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:28:56.856 --> 00:28:59.618]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:28:59.818 --> 00:29:02.701]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:29:02.881 --> 00:29:07.585]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:29:07.805 --> 00:29:08.746]  If you simply prepare.
[00:29:08.946 --> 00:29:11.908]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:29:12.188 --> 00:29:19.072]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:29:19.192 --> 00:29:22.314]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:29:39.601 --> 00:29:41.422]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:29:53.234 --> 00:29:55.135]  Waging War on Corruption.
[00:29:55.635 --> 00:29:58.556]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:11.401]  Angels fall to earth, world heats down.
[00:30:12.142 --> 00:30:19.465]  Now your heart is cold, waiting on the summer of my soul.
[00:30:20.731 --> 00:30:26.075]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and the evil ones are amongst us.
[00:30:26.476 --> 00:30:32.440]  Here on the planet, it is up to the good people to stand up against the New World Order.
[00:30:33.021 --> 00:30:38.605]  Dr. Rebecca Carley, medical doctor, surgeon by training, is our guest.
[00:30:38.686 --> 00:30:38.966]  Okay.
[00:30:40.587 --> 00:30:45.351]  Try to give us as much info packed in as you can, because I know it's just incredible knowledge you have.
[00:30:45.651 --> 00:30:50.075]  And first off, fire out your website for folks who want to see all this footnoted and documented.
[00:30:50.862 --> 00:30:51.583]  Thank you so much.
[00:30:51.643 --> 00:30:51.863]  Yes.
[00:30:51.943 --> 00:30:54.625]  It's the triple W's drcarly.com.
[00:30:55.045 --> 00:30:57.907]  That's D-R-C-A-R-L-E-Y.com.
[00:30:58.288 --> 00:31:01.430]  I encourage the listeners to sign up for the updates on my site.
[00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:04.492]  I send out important information on a regular basis.
[00:31:04.893 --> 00:31:13.459]  There's so much information there, but my paper inoculations, the true weapons of mass destruction explains how the vaccines corrupt the immune system.
[00:31:13.499 --> 00:31:15.701]  Cause the very important points people need to know.
[00:31:16.101 --> 00:31:18.543]  It's not just the infections that they're causing.
[00:31:18.905 --> 00:31:28.732]  The injection of the viruses directly into your bloodstream bypassing the upper respiratory and GI tract actually causes your immune system to turn on yourself.
[00:31:29.173 --> 00:31:35.918]  So therefore, all autoimmune diseases, non-traumatic seizures, cancer, and genetic damage is caused by vaccines.
[00:31:36.318 --> 00:31:45.745]  And this is proven in a recent article on my site entitled, The Science of Vaccine Damage, which is research done by non-pharma funded veterinarians
[00:31:46.124 --> 00:31:51.626]  That have proven that the vaccines, once they create antibodies, can attack any part of your body.
[00:31:52.066 --> 00:31:56.727]  So this is the biggest epidemic the world has ever known, vaccine-induced diseases.
[00:31:56.747 --> 00:32:13.652]  I also encourage the listeners to read my response to the CDC's Public Health Protection Guide, because in that document I actually document how, in my own medical books, you see Alex, I'm sure you know, the medical doctors are totally sleep-deprived, brainwashed,
[00:32:14.145 --> 00:32:18.766]  Nutritionally deprived, you go in there like a zombie and you just regurgitate out what they tell you.
[00:32:19.106 --> 00:32:22.607]  You don't actually let it into your consciousness and critically evaluate it.
[00:32:23.047 --> 00:32:35.709]  But in my book, Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, the 6th edition, on page 943, I actually found the following quote, Rarely is prevention of infection considered to be an important goal of vaccination.
[00:32:36.129 --> 00:32:41.550]  In fact, asymptomatic infection can serve to enhance and prolong the immune response.
[00:32:42.065 --> 00:32:48.450]  What that means is that once they're injected directly into your bloodstream, you're not able to push these viruses out.
[00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:49.951]  They remain in your body.
[00:32:49.991 --> 00:32:50.771]  They mutate.
[00:32:51.092 --> 00:32:52.813]  They cause all kinds of havoc.
[00:32:52.853 --> 00:32:55.475]  They recombine with other viruses.
[00:32:55.595 --> 00:33:06.663]  And that brings us into the Baxter situation where this company released the flu vaccine that was mysteriously contaminated for the H5N1 bird flu virus.
[00:33:07.023 --> 00:33:10.526]  And I want to just mention that the smoking gun in this case,
[00:33:10.939 --> 00:33:32.455]  Was contained in an article written by Helen Branswell of the Canadian Press on February 27th, where she actually states that this company, Baxter, where they had this experimental virus material made at the Ortho Donal Research Facility, they not only make the flu vaccine, but they also make the bird flu vaccine.
[00:33:32.935 --> 00:33:34.857]  And they're expecting their license shortly.
[00:33:34.937 --> 00:33:36.518]  So isn't it amazing, Alex,
[00:33:36.926 --> 00:33:43.371]  That they released this to 18 countries and they've got a vaccine for bird flu just waiting to be sold.
[00:33:43.871 --> 00:33:51.357]  So this is obviously what their intention was to open this Pandora's box and then they would step forward with the alleged cure.
[00:33:52.518 --> 00:34:01.024]  Well, you know, even the Czech Republic newspapers, mainstream ones, were saying this looks like it could be staged and saying what you just said.
[00:34:01.044 --> 00:34:04.687]  There's no other explanation for it.
[00:34:05.137 --> 00:34:12.079]  And I want to also ask the listeners to consider, what is the difference between this and what happened with the anthrax mailings?
[00:34:12.859 --> 00:34:22.282]  There's no way this can't be intentional because they have this, as I said, smoking gun where they are making a vaccine that they will sell once the bird flu is unleashed.
[00:34:22.803 --> 00:34:28.584]  So we had the situation where they sent anthrax in mailings, which they've sent bird flu in mailings.
[00:34:28.965 --> 00:34:30.125]  We called this a crime.
[00:34:30.715 --> 00:34:32.477]  And why isn't that a crime?
[00:34:32.517 --> 00:34:40.404]  These people should be persecuted and prosecuted and put in jail for unleashing this on the public, and we still don't know what's going to happen.
[00:34:40.804 --> 00:34:43.386]  I think we're going to start hearing about bird flu very soon.
[00:34:43.406 --> 00:34:44.387]  All right, stay there.
[00:34:44.447 --> 00:34:45.588]  Let's talk about that when we get back.
[00:34:45.728 --> 00:34:52.374]  For those who don't know, the White House was on Cipro, the anthrax-fighting antibiotic, and they owned the stock on September 10th, and that was admitted in the Associated Press.
[00:34:52.414 --> 00:34:56.077]  Art Fleischer admitted the whole White House knew because they launched the attack.
[00:34:56.818 --> 00:35:00.721]  They have secret death squads that wanted to be dictators, but they wouldn't launch the anthrax just to government strength.
[00:35:00.741 --> 00:35:03.663]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:35:03.823 --> 00:35:09.047]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:35:09.347 --> 00:35:14.690]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:35:15.051 --> 00:35:16.172]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:35:16.532 --> 00:35:25.418]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[00:35:25.838 --> 00:35:27.480]  Now compare a Kalben Pure Soap.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.864]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[00:35:31.904 --> 00:35:36.528]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[00:35:36.909 --> 00:35:38.590]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[00:35:40.752 --> 00:35:41.513]  Keep it natural.
[00:35:41.833 --> 00:35:50.018]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[00:35:50.238 --> 00:35:54.380]  Try Calvin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.701]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[00:35:55.721 --> 00:35:57.622]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:36:04.102 --> 00:36:06.245]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:36:06.746 --> 00:36:13.756]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:36:14.312 --> 00:36:20.518]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:36:20.898 --> 00:36:22.740]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.282]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:36:25.382 --> 00:36:36.312]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:36:36.953 --> 00:36:38.254]  It's not about left or right.
[00:36:38.635 --> 00:36:39.976]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:46.816]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:36:47.377 --> 00:36:55.164]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com, or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:55.645 --> 00:36:56.806]  The Obama Deception.
[00:36:57.226 --> 00:36:58.488]  The people strike back.
[00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:02.371]  Hi, this is Steve Shank.
[00:37:02.932 --> 00:37:03.993]  Our government has handed
[00:37:07.005 --> 00:37:11.006]  No accountability to the very bankers who created this whole mess we're in.
[00:37:11.486 --> 00:37:15.607]  Millions have lost their jobs to corporate corruption and mismanagement.
[00:37:16.007 --> 00:37:22.249]  Trillions in savings, net worth, and retirement accounts have been lost by investors and homeowners.
[00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:33.372]  When you really look at all the theft, crimes, secret organizations, and pervasive corruption going on, it's enough to make you think of your second favorite F word, food.
[00:37:34.052 --> 00:37:36.433]  Food, the F word that we had all better be
[00:37:40.077 --> 00:37:40.297]  Big Brother!
[00:38:06.497 --> 00:38:07.537]  Mainstream media.
[00:38:08.277 --> 00:38:09.378]  Government cover-ups.
[00:38:10.038 --> 00:38:10.838]  You want answers?
[00:38:11.598 --> 00:38:12.638]  Well, so does he.
[00:38:13.159 --> 00:38:16.799]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:21.441]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:38:22.261 --> 00:38:23.261]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:38:23.421 --> 00:38:24.381]  I am your host.
[00:38:25.501 --> 00:38:26.702]  And we are here live.
[00:38:27.202 --> 00:38:30.323]  By the way, I've been told I'm on local PBS in Austin this weekend.
[00:38:30.343 --> 00:38:31.423]  They're interviewing me live.
[00:38:32.737 --> 00:38:40.438]  Russian TV is coming here to interview me again and some more foreign media and I'm just putting it out here, just in our own little corner of the world in a fight against the globalists.
[00:38:41.058 --> 00:38:47.280]  It is just popping and booming and people are really waking up and listening because we did the groundwork.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:52.461]  We woke people up, we warned them, we explained what was going to happen from the globalists' own documents, their own battle plans.
[00:38:52.561 --> 00:38:58.342]  It's happening, but not without huge resistance and if you look at the resistance curve, it is massive.
[00:38:58.582 --> 00:39:00.362]  The state's revolting, everything happening.
[00:39:01.897 --> 00:39:13.294]  That's why I believe the enemy is going to stage terror attacks and smash shootings and a lot of other things and start new wars, as the Rand Corporation said they want to do.
[00:39:13.314 --> 00:39:14.436]  I mean, they tell us what they're going to do.
[00:39:14.476 --> 00:39:15.377]  It's not like I'm predicting it.
[00:39:16.107 --> 00:39:17.167]  Like reading the TV Guide.
[00:39:17.887 --> 00:39:21.608]  And false flag is, I don't think on the horizon, I think it's here with us now.
[00:39:21.669 --> 00:39:25.830]  I think they've got their finger on the button and it says just push the button.
[00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:28.690]  For men in here, just one button I push.
[00:39:29.571 --> 00:39:36.873]  And the New World Order is a lot more nasty secretive globalist than Dick Cheney running around with secret hit squads and the rest of it like we covered last hour.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.600]  It's just so important what we're dealing with.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:52.123]  You know, Dr. Rebecca Carley, when you were on with me briefly for 30 minutes last week, you said, oh, what about this article with all the homeless dying from shots in Europe for bird flu and it kills them in investigations.
[00:39:52.143 --> 00:39:52.963]  And what about this and that?
[00:39:52.983 --> 00:39:54.123]  And I was pulling up everything you were saying.
[00:39:54.163 --> 00:39:55.664]  It was all mainstream news.
[00:39:55.784 --> 00:39:56.504]  I hadn't seen it.
[00:39:56.564 --> 00:39:57.284]  I didn't know.
[00:39:57.304 --> 00:39:59.404]  And they keep hyping bird flu, bird flu.
[00:39:59.424 --> 00:40:00.024]  It's going to get you.
[00:40:00.065 --> 00:40:00.765]  Millions will die.
[00:40:00.825 --> 00:40:01.585]  Bird flu, bird flu.
[00:40:01.865 --> 00:40:02.605]  Give up all your rights.
[00:40:02.645 --> 00:40:03.545]  Bird flu, bird flu.
[00:40:04.826 --> 00:40:05.986]  What do you see happening here?
[00:40:06.006 --> 00:40:06.586]  Please continue.
[00:40:07.284 --> 00:40:10.846]  Well, as I said, I think the horse is already out of the barn.
[00:40:10.926 --> 00:40:25.195]  All of these people that were exposed to this mailing from Baxter have already been exposed to the bird flu, and we don't know how many people are incubating it right now as we speak, and are going to end up coming out with the bird flu, and it's truly chilling.
[00:40:25.215 --> 00:40:26.635]  Let's see.
[00:40:26.756 --> 00:40:27.376]  Let me stop you.
[00:40:27.396 --> 00:40:34.920]  I mean, that's quite an announcement, but people are already dying in cases all over the world, and the London Telegraph and other places, they'll never say,
[00:40:36.121 --> 00:40:42.506]  It'll say authorities in Poland with the 23 dead from the 360 given at one homeless clinic.
[00:40:42.746 --> 00:40:47.870]  The homeless clinic says they were misled by pharmacological companies that it was regular flu vaccine.
[00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:52.253]  But they were paid to tell the homeless that it was just regular and then it killed them.
[00:40:52.873 --> 00:40:54.374]  And people are dying.
[00:40:54.855 --> 00:41:00.078]  And then they also are reporting on this HPV live cancer virus saying it could mutate.
[00:41:00.098 --> 00:41:02.260]  They're admitting on CBS News it's killing people.
[00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.521]  And so the people are dying.
[00:41:05.582 --> 00:41:14.149]  I wanted to ask you, do you know what companies, because it doesn't say in the mainstream news, what companies it is that the shots are killing people in these tests in Europe?
[00:41:14.849 --> 00:41:22.295]  Well, I think all the companies that are making the bird flu vaccine are actually testing people to see if it does kill them.
[00:41:22.756 --> 00:41:24.357]  I think that was the intention.
[00:41:24.738 --> 00:41:27.520]  For them to test this vaccine in the homeless people.
[00:41:27.881 --> 00:41:30.843]  And by the way, yes, it's in the mainstream media in the UK.
[00:41:30.883 --> 00:41:32.805]  Telegraph.co.uk.
[00:41:33.065 --> 00:41:34.286]  Certainly not in this country.
[00:41:34.586 --> 00:41:39.371]  But I think they're doing these tests to specifically see how well the vaccine is working.
[00:41:39.411 --> 00:41:41.973]  That is the intention for them to kill people.
[00:41:42.353 --> 00:41:49.479]  As a matter of fact, on March 4th of 2009, let's remember that the Baxter release was reported on February 27th.
[00:41:49.539 --> 00:41:51.381]  So this is like a week later.
[00:41:51.841 --> 00:41:52.342]  They had a
[00:41:53.064 --> 00:42:00.690]  A conference, an emergency management summit agenda that took place in, let's see, I believe it was Colorado.
[00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:00.950]  Yes.
[00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:12.698]  And this is what one of their minions, PJ Havis Cover, mental health professional and program coordinator, stated that community memorial services are very important.
[00:42:13.058 --> 00:42:17.021]  When you're talking to people, voice your appreciation for those in quarantine.
[00:42:17.382 --> 00:42:19.243]  Talk about how their hometown heroes
[00:42:19.631 --> 00:42:23.112]  And doing what they need to be doing in order to protect the community.
[00:42:23.413 --> 00:42:26.154]  So they're already telling people get ready for quarantine.
[00:42:26.434 --> 00:42:32.436]  So obviously the people within the government, FEMA type of organizations, already know what's coming.
[00:42:32.936 --> 00:42:35.958]  My God, and what is the source of that bombshell you just dropped?
[00:42:36.358 --> 00:42:38.198]  Citizens for Legitimate Government.
[00:42:39.979 --> 00:42:43.280]  www.legitgov.org I know who they are.
[00:42:44.041 --> 00:42:46.822]  They're saying they were at the meeting and are reporting this?
[00:42:47.406 --> 00:42:51.193]  Yes, that's what they're reporting in this article that I have.
[00:42:53.951 --> 00:42:54.091]  I think?
[00:43:18.385 --> 00:43:34.084]  That when you pull back from all of this, and you know that there's been tens of thousands of declassified chemical, biological, radiological, lethal tests, not just syphilis and Tuskegee that everybody knows about, but biologicals in New York subways, death results, details remain classified.
[00:43:34.104 --> 00:43:35.685]  That's mainstream Reuters, AP.
[00:43:36.706 --> 00:43:39.769]  Uh, you know, spraying the ship channel in San Francisco, killing people.
[00:43:39.849 --> 00:43:42.090]  Plague bombs released in Scotland, killing people.
[00:43:42.631 --> 00:43:46.854]  Uh, headlines, every square inch of England's been sprayed with chemical, biological, radiological, Leningradian.
[00:43:46.894 --> 00:43:47.795]  It's all in the endgame.
[00:43:48.155 --> 00:43:49.416]  When you know they took U.S.
[00:43:49.436 --> 00:43:58.642]  troops, radiated them to death, gave them, uh, biological weapons, injected them with, uh, sarin and VX nerve gas to kill them, and then told their family they died in a car wreck or died of flu.
[00:43:59.841 --> 00:44:10.910]  And we know they brought the Nazis over here because the Nazis got the idea from us, so the scientists then wanted them after World War II and brought them here to not just, you know, head up NASA, but head up the CIA, everything else that's declassified.
[00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:12.131]  Tens of thousands of Nazis.
[00:44:12.391 --> 00:44:13.252]  This is eugenics.
[00:44:13.512 --> 00:44:17.475]  You got top professors running around in biology departments saying, soon it'll all be airborne.
[00:44:17.495 --> 00:44:19.617]  90% of you will die, including my family.
[00:44:19.697 --> 00:44:20.478]  Oh, it's so wonderful.
[00:44:20.758 --> 00:44:21.999]  You know, like 13 monkeys.
[00:44:22.279 --> 00:44:28.284]  The point is, is that these psychos have done this over and over again, and now they're messing with stuff that could release the mega-plague.
[00:44:29.158 --> 00:44:29.999]  Well, exactly.
[00:44:30.019 --> 00:44:34.727]  And this is all being done intentionally under Title 50 of the U.S.
[00:44:34.808 --> 00:44:35.128]  Code.
[00:44:35.188 --> 00:44:38.313]  Go to your local library, folks, look up U.S.
[00:44:38.374 --> 00:44:40.317]  Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, Section 1520 and 1524.
[00:44:43.706 --> 00:44:47.147]  Where the Department of Defense can use human subjects for testing of chemicals.
[00:44:47.227 --> 00:44:48.947]  And by the way, people don't know how to read that.
[00:44:48.967 --> 00:44:49.687]  They pull up U.S.
[00:44:49.727 --> 00:44:51.848]  Code, Title 50, Chapter... U.S.
[00:44:51.888 --> 00:44:52.788]  Code, Title 50.
[00:44:53.268 --> 00:44:53.908]  Chapter 52.
[00:44:54.749 --> 00:44:57.689]  Yeah, subsection 1528, paragraph B, correct?
[00:44:58.109 --> 00:44:58.510]  Right.
[00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:01.230]  Okay, I've got to get in the brain focus to bring that up.
[00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:09.292]  In there, it says you're not allowed to do it without consent unless it's for government testing, and then lists other things.
[00:45:09.332 --> 00:45:13.093]  And people read it and say it says they can't do it, except for whenever they want.
[00:45:13.973 --> 00:45:20.658]  Well actually it's very funny because the initial one was written in the 1960s and I actually learned about this on C-SPAN.
[00:45:20.998 --> 00:45:24.401]  A caller called in and of course C-SPAN has millions of listeners.
[00:45:24.781 --> 00:45:33.427]  And so in April of 2000 they repealed it, but just like they always do, what they did is not only loophole it back in, but actually add things.
[00:45:33.467 --> 00:45:39.592]  They said that there's restrictions on the use of human subjects for testing of chemical or biological agents.
[00:45:39.972 --> 00:45:41.313]  Here are the exceptions.
[00:45:41.774 --> 00:45:43.495]  Any peaceful purpose related to a
[00:45:44.431 --> 00:45:44.971]  We're good to go.
[00:46:03.513 --> 00:46:12.675]  That's right, and then, just like folks call up and say, oh this isn't real from the state police, you can just call them and they admit it, and we have, and it's not real, and oh that U.S.
[00:46:12.695 --> 00:46:18.576]  code's not real, and the Patriot Act doesn't say that all misdemeanors are terrorism, and I have top lawyers on and they admit it on air.
[00:46:19.596 --> 00:46:31.498]  Yes, and I also just want to remind the listeners, and this is something that you might want to consider putting in your Obama Deception 1.5, in regards to what's happening with the economic stimulus package,
[00:46:31.954 --> 00:46:49.719]  In terms of extra money now, we have $954 million that's going to be used as an additional amount to carry out the immunization program authorized by Section 317 A, J, K, and K-1 of the Public Health Service Act.
[00:46:49.759 --> 00:46:58.202]  So, not only are they going to be spending almost a billion dollars for more vaccines, but they've also allocated over half a billion dollars
[00:46:58.615 --> 00:46:59.516]  We're good to go.
[00:47:15.009 --> 00:47:17.231]  And this could cause the extinction of the human race.
[00:47:17.331 --> 00:47:18.172]  This is no joke.
[00:47:18.232 --> 00:47:40.630]  By the way, a lot of top scientists and headlines have admitted that, that mercury itself alters DNA permanently, even mitochondrial, passed on by the mother, and that all of these things are actually downgrading and destroying our DNA, and now they've got this whole new level that they call vaccines that are really genetic engineering mutagens, where they say, oh, you'll take a shot and you'll never be able to get high off cocaine again,
[00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:47.872]  But then they admit in the literature, but you won't be able to have your regular endorphins and be happy, and the viruses go in and eat certain areas of the brain.
[00:47:48.252 --> 00:47:49.872]  And I tell people that and they just don't understand.
[00:47:49.892 --> 00:47:56.954]  Can you talk about those class of live biological agent vaccines that redesign organs?
[00:47:57.734 --> 00:47:57.994]  Yes.
[00:47:58.155 --> 00:48:07.417]  Well, first of all, let me say that every single thing that's in a vaccine, every single product, like you said, the mercury, the formaldehyde,
[00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:11.173]  Every single thing that's in the vaccine does its own damage.
[00:48:11.833 --> 00:48:32.809]  In fact, I had talked to somebody on my internet radio show who had worked in the Air Force, or something to do with airplanes, and he reported that you're not even allowed to bring mercury on an airplane because the reaction it will have with aluminum is so violent that it can burn holes in an aluminum plane.
[00:48:33.189 --> 00:48:34.670]  So people could ask themselves,
[00:48:35.023 --> 00:48:40.305]  Why are they putting mercury and aluminum together and injecting it directly into your bloodstream?
[00:48:40.945 --> 00:48:45.427]  As a matter of fact, I have another NATO book entitled Immunological Adjuvants and Vaccines.
[00:48:45.827 --> 00:48:57.372]  In this book, which was published in 1989, they actually admit that it's the aluminum in vaccines that causes the production of IgE, which is the antibody of allergy.
[00:48:57.732 --> 00:48:59.533]  So they have known all these years.
[00:48:59.949 --> 00:49:07.892]  That all of the allergies being produced, including the life-threatening and oftentimes fatal anaphylactic reactions from peanuts.
[00:49:07.972 --> 00:49:15.695]  You have little children in school sitting next to a child that's eating a peanut butter sandwich, and just smelling that peanut butter can kill them.
[00:49:16.135 --> 00:49:18.916]  Yeah, nobody was allergic to it 50 years ago.
[00:49:19.316 --> 00:49:21.917]  Now it's just, now almost every food, people can't eat it.
[00:49:22.398 --> 00:49:22.918]  Exactly.
[00:49:23.238 --> 00:49:28.480]  And not only... Oh, by the way, even if you don't take the vaccines, other kids are leeching it out onto your kids.
[00:49:28.965 --> 00:49:29.265]  Oh yes.
[00:49:29.726 --> 00:49:42.538]  As a matter of fact, most of these outbreaks of measles and such that the media is using as a hype to scare people to get vaccinated, when you read between the lines you find out that almost all those children got the measles vaccine.
[00:49:43.988 --> 00:49:48.471]  Well, they know with everybody that has Crohn's disease, it didn't exist until 50 years ago with vaccines.
[00:49:48.811 --> 00:49:57.697]  They find the antibodies from different vaccines they've been given in their guts, causing an autoimmune disturbance where the people then basically have to have their intestines cut out.
[00:49:58.017 --> 00:49:58.818]  But it's enjoyable.
[00:49:58.838 --> 00:49:59.779]  You know, the government loves you.
[00:50:00.738 --> 00:50:05.040]  Rough roads might be ahead for the economy, but your vehicle doesn't have to experience them.
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.901]  Can't afford a new vehicle or even an expensive repair?

[00:50:49.275 --> 00:50:53.058]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:51:07.279 --> 00:51:12.621]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:51:13.142 --> 00:51:19.344]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:51:19.644 --> 00:51:21.465]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:51:21.625 --> 00:51:24.006]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:51:24.086 --> 00:51:34.971]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:51:37.268 --> 00:51:38.508]  It's not about left or right.
[00:51:38.928 --> 00:51:40.329]  It's about a one world government.
[00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:47.110]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:51:55.952 --> 00:51:57.113]  The Obama Deception.
[00:51:57.533 --> 00:51:58.713]  The people strike back.
[00:52:00.225 --> 00:52:00.545]  Good day.
[00:52:00.726 --> 00:52:02.167]  Jim Newcomer for Midas Resources.
[00:52:02.307 --> 00:52:03.388]  March 12, 2009.
[00:52:03.888 --> 00:52:05.570]  Gold opened this morning at $9.1680.
[00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:09.013]  A 1-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.4330, $4.7165 for the half-ounce, and $2.3582 for a quarter-ounce.
[00:52:09.033 --> 00:52:09.414]  That's $9.4330, $4.7165, and $2.3582.
[00:52:18.061 --> 00:52:30.447]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:52:30.587 --> 00:52:33.648]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:52:33.748 --> 00:52:37.050]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:39.931]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[00:52:40.191 --> 00:52:42.934]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.

[00:53:04.819 --> 00:53:11.243]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:53:11.924 --> 00:53:12.624]  Here is why.
[00:53:13.385 --> 00:53:23.292]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:53:23.812 --> 00:53:26.193]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:53:26.553 --> 00:53:28.634]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:53:28.674 --> 00:53:29.154]  this fall?
[00:53:29.655 --> 00:53:30.155]  Don't wait.
[00:53:30.655 --> 00:53:34.196]  Learn the food shortage skills that can keep you and your family alive in a crisis.

[00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:55.510]  Act now!
[00:54:04.693 --> 00:54:09.756]  You know, the full magnitude of all this just slammed me like a ton of bricks during the break.
[00:54:09.776 --> 00:54:10.896]  Just boom!
[00:54:11.977 --> 00:54:19.381]  That happens, you know, a couple times a week when it's just the full magnitude, even though I constantly study this, just punches me like a freight train.
[00:54:19.621 --> 00:54:20.161]  Bam!
[00:54:23.595 --> 00:54:41.329]  And I realize psychopathic eugenics elites are in control of the planet, putting sodium fluoride in the water and hundreds of other toxins and poisons, genetic engineering spraying, genetic engineered food that kills the rats and guinea pigs they test on, mutations that are only supposed to happen embryonically, happen after birth.
[00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:58.085]  Mass illnesses, children sick, cancer exploding at every level, SWAT teams, FEMA camps, demonization of patriots, world government rising, openly saying once they have the world government in place they're going to start killing billions at a time, mass wipeouts.
[00:54:58.926 --> 00:55:00.607]  We were right about the whole setup of this.
[00:55:00.707 --> 00:55:02.949]  Do you want to wait and have the rest happen?
[00:55:02.969 --> 00:55:04.171]  I don't even know if we can stop it.
[00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:05.112]  God help us.
[00:55:06.892 --> 00:55:09.774]  And they could launch this any day, or it could happen five years from now.
[00:55:09.994 --> 00:55:13.596]  You know, the big kill, not just the soft kill build-up as they're testing all of this.
[00:55:14.357 --> 00:55:16.758]  Dr. Rebecca Carley, I want to come back and start taking calls for you.
[00:55:17.218 --> 00:55:21.401]  But give out your website again for folks, and please continue with the analysis you were breaking down.
[00:55:22.021 --> 00:55:29.406]  Okay, it's www.drcarley.com, and I totally agree with you, what you were saying in your previous segment, Alex.
[00:55:29.446 --> 00:55:31.707]  The good news is people are waking up big time.
[00:55:32.047 --> 00:55:34.909]  They realize that they are dead meat if they don't rise up.
[00:55:35.233 --> 00:55:39.196]  But I just want to finish the thought that you were talking about, about the autoimmune aspect.
[00:55:39.477 --> 00:55:41.038]  Because this is so huge, folks.
[00:55:41.118 --> 00:55:42.479]  It's not just the viruses.
[00:55:42.859 --> 00:55:45.942]  They are culturing these viruses on different tissues.
[00:55:46.302 --> 00:55:48.744]  More and more now they're using aborted fetus cells.
[00:55:49.165 --> 00:55:57.992]  So if you're injected with an aborted fetus's nervous system tissue, you will develop antibodies against that nervous system and those antibodies will attack you.
[00:55:58.432 --> 00:56:00.574]  If you develop, if you get a piece of their gut,
[00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:04.392]  And that's injected into you, you develop antibodies against the gut.
[00:56:04.472 --> 00:56:05.592]  Let me stop you!
[00:56:05.712 --> 00:56:06.493]  I've got to stop you!
[00:56:06.513 --> 00:56:11.015]  Everything you're saying is true because Europe has been using dead babies.
[00:56:11.575 --> 00:56:18.358]  I mean, dead babies, grind them up to mix them and they have stem cells all in them which allows wild mutations.
[00:56:19.098 --> 00:56:22.140]  There are genetic viruses encoded in the DNA.
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:25.021]  Yes, but my point is that you're developing antibodies against those babies
[00:56:45.163 --> 00:56:49.367]  A DNA or a monkey kidney or whatever else they're using to culture the virus.
[00:56:49.387 --> 00:56:50.288]  Let me stop you again.
[00:56:50.308 --> 00:56:58.094]  200 million Americans vaccinated at least in the first round of it with the simian virus 40 that they admittedly gives people cancer.
[00:56:58.154 --> 00:56:58.915]  Government admits it.
[00:56:59.115 --> 00:57:00.977]  That was just from monkey kidneys.
[00:57:01.237 --> 00:57:03.679]  Think about what happens with human and pig tissue.
[00:57:03.739 --> 00:57:04.139]  Go ahead.
[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:05.180]  Exactly.
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:06.822]  And that's what people have to realize.
[00:57:07.382 --> 00:57:11.666]  And I just want to say the good news is that I have developed a protocol that reverses these
[00:57:12.182 --> 00:57:12.703]  I think so.
[00:57:30.836 --> 00:57:34.138]  But you have to understand that this is certainly their agenda.
[00:57:34.498 --> 00:57:36.559]  And I also have a YouTube video up now.
[00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:38.500]  I got into C-SPAN last Saturday.
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:42.262]  They were asking callers if they are for the stem cell research.
[00:57:42.602 --> 00:57:49.686]  And of course, I called in to ask, first of all, if the government's interested in our health, why are they trying to take away our supplements by codex?
[00:57:50.046 --> 00:57:53.788]  And more importantly, why are they creating disease with vaccinations?
[00:57:54.188 --> 00:57:57.790]  Not to mention the fact is the government is now going to be telling us
[00:57:58.337 --> 00:58:03.623]  What treatment we're allowed to get under their socialized medicine, do any of you think
[00:58:04.008 --> 00:58:11.271]  That if a stem cell study was able to reverse paralysis, say, that your average Joe is going to have access to that?
[00:58:11.311 --> 00:58:12.051]  Of course not!
[00:58:12.251 --> 00:58:28.818]  Well, I mean, as you know, doctor, they've already come out with just many different cells, the skin cells, breast cells, all these other cells that work just as good or better, and they don't have the mutagen qualities of the hyperactive fetal stem cells, but they don't care.
[00:58:28.858 --> 00:58:30.719]  They said, don't you want to cure disease?
[00:58:31.059 --> 00:58:33.160]  All they do is shell all the real treatments.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:35.721]  Of course, they're creating disease.
[00:58:36.141 --> 00:58:39.922]  Vaccine-induced diseases is the biggest epidemic the world has ever known.
[00:58:40.282 --> 00:58:42.222]  It's not just in people, it's in pets.
[00:58:42.583 --> 00:58:48.024]  And Alex, I'm sure you're probably also aware, they're vaccinating every food source animal you can imagine.
[00:58:48.364 --> 00:58:57.487]  I used to say as a joke when I would give my lectures, if you had a sick fish and it was in a fishbowl that was dirty, would you vaccinate the fish or would you clean the water?
[00:58:57.527 --> 00:58:58.867]  Well, guess what, Alex?
[00:58:59.147 --> 00:59:01.188]  They're now vaccinating farm-raised fish.
[00:59:01.667 --> 00:59:04.149]  They're vaccinating everything you're putting into your mouth.
[00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:07.913]  If you're a chicken wing fan, uh, fan folks, guess what?
[00:59:07.973 --> 00:59:11.416]  That's where they're injecting the vaccines into the chicken is in their wings.
[00:59:11.496 --> 00:59:12.277]  And let me expand.
[00:59:14.593 --> 00:59:16.594]  I meant to get to this two weeks ago when it first broke.
[00:59:16.734 --> 00:59:19.755]  Major university studies with the veterinarians.
[00:59:19.775 --> 00:59:21.515]  Oh, let's talk about it when we come back because I know you know about that.
[00:59:21.535 --> 00:59:22.735]  We didn't have time to cover that last week.
[00:59:23.315 --> 00:59:28.797]  They're finding massive increases of cancer in the injection site on dogs and cats.
[00:59:29.057 --> 00:59:34.218]  And everybody I know that won't listen to me goes and vaccinates their dog and it has seizures or their cat dies.
[00:59:34.738 --> 00:59:35.799]  This didn't used to happen.
[00:59:35.879 --> 00:59:39.860]  What's in the vaccines for dogs and cats that's killing them and hurting them?
[00:59:40.802 --> 00:59:42.343]  I know I'm all over the map here and interrupting her.
[00:59:42.464 --> 00:59:44.365]  Everything she's saying is totally documented.
[00:59:44.385 --> 00:59:45.346]  We're totally screwed.
[00:59:45.366 --> 00:59:46.767]  I don't know what we're going to do.
[00:59:47.128 --> 00:59:49.069]  But the real threat according to the police is Ron Paul.
[00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:49.690]  So, you know.
[00:59:50.611 --> 00:59:51.512]  We're on the march.
[00:59:52.012 --> 00:59:53.614]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:59:54.554 --> 00:59:57.237]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:00.686 --> 01:00:04.330]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:10.036]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:00:10.116 --> 01:00:14.181]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:00:14.461 --> 01:00:16.743]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[01:00:16.924 --> 01:00:22.830]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:23.730]  We're good to go!
[01:00:52.265 --> 01:00:55.669]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:00:55.709 --> 01:01:00.034]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:20.707]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:01:21.087 --> 01:01:22.929]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:01:23.069 --> 01:01:25.472]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:01:25.572 --> 01:01:36.524]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:01:37.128 --> 01:01:38.429]  It's not about left or right.
[01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:40.209]  It's about a one world government.
[01:01:40.649 --> 01:01:47.032]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:01:55.835 --> 01:01:56.975]  The Obama Deception.
[01:01:57.395 --> 01:01:58.596]  The people strike back.
[01:02:00.723 --> 01:02:04.104]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:02:04.224 --> 01:02:09.445]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:14.406]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:02:14.786 --> 01:02:25.909]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:31.852]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:02:32.073 --> 01:02:38.156]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:02:38.356 --> 01:02:38.997]  What about you?
[01:02:39.377 --> 01:02:45.421]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:03:20.819 --> 01:03:22.761]  Folks, I want you to understand something.
[01:03:22.801 --> 01:03:24.162]  I believe everything I've said here.
[01:03:24.222 --> 01:03:26.265]  And I've researched it and documented it for myself.
[01:03:26.285 --> 01:03:29.167]  And I'm not a medical doctor like Dr. Carly.
[01:03:30.208 --> 01:03:34.333]  But I've had countless medical doctors and virologists on here telling you the same thing.
[01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:42.091]  You know, they'll freak out and yell and scream about some nut-killing to people, and that's a tragedy, but there's vaccine deaths constantly.
[01:03:42.111 --> 01:03:45.492]  They'll have a debate about autism and mercury, and that's a small part of it.
[01:03:45.532 --> 01:03:50.754]  It's the autoimmune swelling that's the main cause, according to all their own studies.
[01:03:51.134 --> 01:03:56.335]  You just never see it in the mainline news, or you see a blurb about it, then you've got to go to the study itself.
[01:03:57.595 --> 01:04:03.157]  I am fighting as hard as I can, and I am looking at farms an hour or two away,
[01:04:04.246 --> 01:04:08.628]  I'm going to do the TV show here, but it's getting so crazy and I can feel they're moving towards it.
[01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:19.034]  I say I feel, all the analysis together, and then the subconscious mind integrates that into an overlay of projection of the future as best we can.
[01:04:19.054 --> 01:04:25.157]  We all have that ability, the great brain God gave us, but my children are also most important to me.
[01:04:26.198 --> 01:04:30.200]  That's why I take the risk and do the things I'm doing, because the risk of doing nothing is much greater.
[01:04:31.949 --> 01:04:39.516]  And I know I'm saying it's totally safe to run to the hills, because if we do that, they're all going to win, but people should have some out, some backup.
[01:04:42.539 --> 01:04:43.800]  My God, it's just so horrible.
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:47.883]  Dr. Carley, please continue with what's happening to the animals in the vaccines.
[01:04:49.105 --> 01:04:57.312]  Well, let me just also mention, yes, the children are our most valuable asset, and that's why the medical mafia has actually taken my only child away from me.
[01:04:58.014 --> 01:05:07.122]  I have been persecuted more than any other medical doctor that speaks about vaccines because I go to the genocidal level and that's why I'm so honored that you're having me on your show.
[01:05:07.442 --> 01:05:18.531]  But yes, in fact, if you go to my website, DrCarly.com, within the article, Science of Vaccine Damage, a researcher, Gary Smith, actually explains what cancer is.
[01:05:18.692 --> 01:05:22.415]  It's a wound that never heals because what happens is that the
[01:05:23.579 --> 01:05:27.981]  The inflammation that occurs is actually not the body trying to fight the infection.
[01:05:28.381 --> 01:05:38.284]  It's the virus or bacteria deliberately causing inflammation to hide that virus and bacteria which can mutate and cause cancer from the immune system.
[01:05:38.624 --> 01:05:47.727]  Then we also have the aluminum in the vaccine which mutates the p53 oncogene which is actually supposed to suppress the formation of tumors.
[01:05:48.087 --> 01:05:52.929]  So now you have the aluminum in there actually causing the tumors to go into hyperdrive.
[01:05:53.274 --> 01:06:01.039]  We have carcinogens like formaldehyde in vaccines that are actually cancer-causing agents, and they're injecting that into people as well.
[01:06:01.359 --> 01:06:05.061]  And let's not forget to mention the Special Virus Cancer Project.
[01:06:05.481 --> 01:06:12.065]  I have multiple years of documents of this in my progress report number 9 here before we publish in 1982.
[01:06:12.285 --> 01:06:19.810]  They're actually doing research, such as the Southwest Foundation for Research and Education, a branch of the NIH,
[01:06:20.572 --> 01:06:23.334]  They're studying latent virus infection and transmission.
[01:06:23.615 --> 01:06:28.519]  They're studying how to activate these viruses with pesticides and other things.
[01:06:28.899 --> 01:06:35.185]  I mean, it's just unbelievable when you read the documents, just like the Nazis are basically telling us what they're doing.
[01:06:35.805 --> 01:06:38.647]  We have another one by the Bionetics Research Laboratories.
[01:06:38.708 --> 01:06:42.110]  Investigations of viral carcinogenesis in primates.
[01:06:42.451 --> 01:06:47.355]  They want to figure out what actually activates carcinogenesis.
[01:06:47.771 --> 01:06:51.592]  And as I explain in my paper, inoculations are true weapons of mass destruction.
[01:06:51.912 --> 01:06:59.094]  When you're injecting all these viruses into a person or a pet, of course that's a total distraction for the immune system.
[01:06:59.494 --> 01:07:11.857]  The T-cells, which I describe as the little Pac-Man cells, whose job it is to go around and gobble up cancer cells, they're totally paralyzed because the B-cell arm is so busy creating antibodies.
[01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:15.571]  So there's many different factors involved in forming cancer.
[01:07:16.251 --> 01:07:24.813]  On my website, I actually have an mp3 file of a show I did on cancer which people can listen to that explains the various aspects.
[01:07:25.133 --> 01:07:26.353]  But this is so huge!
[01:07:26.753 --> 01:07:39.216]  And as we see cancer increasing and increasing, we have, you know, the Susan G. Komen marching, you know, having people march around to raise millions of dollars for research to find a cure.
[01:07:39.496 --> 01:07:41.356]  How about if we get rid of the cause folk?
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:46.163]  How about if we stop these inoculations, which are the true weapons of mass destruction?
[01:07:47.324 --> 01:07:50.126]  You know, I know that they came and took your medical license.
[01:07:50.146 --> 01:07:51.447]  You fought them and got it back.
[01:07:52.348 --> 01:07:53.869]  No, actually, I didn't fight them.
[01:07:54.609 --> 01:08:00.954]  What they wanted me to do, and let me just say, when I was a surgeon, I never had a single complaint against me, even then.
[01:08:00.974 --> 01:08:09.380]  So what they did was, I was on public access TV in Long Island, and I did a show about the pedophiles and the high layers of government.
[01:08:10.058 --> 01:08:14.880]  They used that to bring a charge against me that I have a delusion of conspiracy.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:34.886]  And even though ten psychologists and psychiatrists examined me and found that I was fine, they found their whore from France, Zev Labins, who said, not only do I have a delusion, but it was so dangerous that in order to practice medicine, I would have to undergo psychiatric treatment, electroshock therapy, or institutionalization.
[01:08:35.322 --> 01:08:37.343]  So that's when I told them they can keep their license.
[01:08:37.423 --> 01:08:38.323]  I'm a teacher now.
[01:08:38.723 --> 01:08:41.664]  I've totally taken myself out from under their auspice.
[01:08:41.704 --> 01:08:44.645]  No, I know, but I read that you'd successfully beaten them.
[01:08:44.665 --> 01:08:46.065]  I guess that was wrong.
[01:08:46.105 --> 01:08:54.608]  But, I mean, specifically, though, so much of what you're saying is in the mainline literature, and now they're saying it's mentally ill to believe in the New World Order.
[01:08:55.008 --> 01:08:55.208]  Yes.
[01:08:55.668 --> 01:08:57.329]  And they're saying people need to be grabbed.
[01:08:57.589 --> 01:09:01.070]  And, you know, they arrested Ezra Pound, the Pulitzer Prize winner.
[01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:06.012]  Because he said the Federal Reserve was private and put him in a mental institution.
[01:09:06.072 --> 01:09:09.853]  So people go to mental institutions, folks, for saying the Federal Reserve is private now.
[01:09:09.953 --> 01:09:13.254]  Well, this is a very important thing that I want to make the listeners realize.
[01:09:13.594 --> 01:09:17.235]  They're actually committing genocide, murder by medicine in hospitals now.
[01:09:17.556 --> 01:09:19.816]  We all know the Medicare trust fund is gone.
[01:09:20.296 --> 01:09:24.618]  And actually, that's been a fact for many years.
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:28.402]  So what they're doing with older people in the hospital is they're taking them out.
[01:09:28.442 --> 01:09:32.524]  They're giving them morphine to stop their breathing, mismatched blood transfusions.
[01:09:32.544 --> 01:09:37.726]  I've actually been involved with many cases as a patient advocate in cases like that.
[01:09:38.026 --> 01:09:40.287]  And people are complaining about the bad doctors.
[01:09:40.647 --> 01:09:43.409]  What you need to do, folks, is stand with the good doctors.
[01:09:43.869 --> 01:09:50.532]  Every single doctor who tells the truth, especially at very extreme levels as I do, they go after their medical license.
[01:09:50.942 --> 01:09:52.744]  And this is what people have to realize.
[01:09:52.784 --> 01:09:56.346]  There's not going to be any doctors that actually are able to help you.
[01:09:56.827 --> 01:10:04.333]  As a matter of fact, with this national health care plan they have planned for us, they're actually going to have governmental clinical guidelines.
[01:10:04.693 --> 01:10:08.496]  So what we're getting to is a place where you don't even need a medical doctor.
[01:10:08.536 --> 01:10:10.318]  You can have a computer sitting in front of you.
[01:10:10.338 --> 01:10:11.319]  And by the way, let me stop you.
[01:10:12.399 --> 01:10:13.861]  My dad's a dentist enrolled surgeon.
[01:10:14.361 --> 01:10:19.946]  He said even before they passed this federal takeover of medicine, now they give them these computer systems
[01:10:20.746 --> 01:10:31.532]  And the HMOs and the government tell you everything you can do, and he says the computer is now the doctor, and the government practices medicine, and it's the dentist, the doctors.
[01:10:31.932 --> 01:10:35.994]  When you go into the hospital to have a baby, they ask you, oh honey, you got plenty of money?
[01:10:36.054 --> 01:10:37.635]  Is your husband nice to you?
[01:10:37.655 --> 01:10:39.976]  That's all going to the health department to seize your kids.
[01:10:40.437 --> 01:10:46.600]  I mean, it's literally, through the public schools and medicine, it is incrementally a Nazi death camp.
[01:10:47.512 --> 01:11:03.022]  I totally agree with you and as a matter of fact the hospitals actually get kickbacks for any cases that they refer to CPS and usually it's if the parents are foolish enough to admit that they don't vaccinate their children if they bring them in for a broken arm or whatever.
[01:11:03.443 --> 01:11:09.647]  They get kickbacks for every child that gets into the system and then gets adopted out or put into foster care or whatever.
[01:11:10.037 --> 01:11:15.279]  I mean, medicine has now become a government entity and it's a viper.
[01:11:15.359 --> 01:11:16.700]  Just like in Nazi Germany.
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:17.900]  I want to go to phone calls here.
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:20.601]  Justin in North Carolina, you're on the air with our guest.
[01:11:20.621 --> 01:11:21.061]  Go ahead.
[01:11:24.843 --> 01:11:27.144]  Justin in North Carolina, you're on the air with Dr. Rebecca Carley.
[01:11:28.024 --> 01:11:28.844]  Hey Alex.
[01:11:28.904 --> 01:11:29.544]  Hey Dr. Carley.
[01:11:29.564 --> 01:11:30.265]  How are y'all doing today?
[01:11:31.005 --> 01:11:31.965]  Okay.
[01:11:32.065 --> 01:11:34.266]  My name's Justin.
[01:11:34.286 --> 01:11:36.427]  I'm from the same town in North Carolina that you live in now.
[01:11:36.467 --> 01:11:37.968]  I'm actually friends with Rick Nunzar.
[01:11:39.389 --> 01:11:40.510]  I was wanting to ask you a question.
[01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:46.994]  Now, you said on your website that you have some kind of cure for the autoimmune diseases.
[01:11:47.435 --> 01:11:52.378]  Do you have any kind of list on there for any kind of natural treatment for the bird flu?
[01:11:52.438 --> 01:11:59.563]  I mean, if it breaks out tomorrow, what can we do as citizens to get some natural, holistic medicines and treat ourselves?
[01:11:59.623 --> 01:12:02.605]  Is there anything that we can have on standby to try to combat this?
[01:12:03.303 --> 01:12:09.471]  Okay well first of all you're not allowed to use the cure word Justin unless you're using medicine which of course cures nothing.
[01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:11.454]  No I'm just saying that's actually a law.
[01:12:11.754 --> 01:12:17.141]  So that's what I do is teach people how to reverse their situations and what I suggest to people is
[01:12:17.577 --> 01:12:25.403]  You know, to detoxify yourself as much as possible, eat organic food, drink good water, learn about natural things that you can use.
[01:12:25.643 --> 01:12:27.725]  Organic vitamins, exercise.
[01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:28.485]  Yes, yes.
[01:12:28.565 --> 01:12:34.510]  But do all the good things to get your body in as good shape as possible before the whole thing explodes.
[01:12:34.530 --> 01:12:37.272]  But yes, there's actually homeopathic remedies that you can get.
[01:12:38.192 --> 01:12:46.694]  I recommend everybody have a colloidal silver generator, because of course the FDA is going after colloidal silver manufacturers with a vengeance now.
[01:12:47.014 --> 01:12:47.974]  Hey, hey, hey!
[01:12:48.014 --> 01:12:53.175]  They're listing vitamin B variants as medicines now, already saying we can't have them in America.
[01:12:53.655 --> 01:12:54.176]  Exactly.
[01:12:54.576 --> 01:12:56.396]  So you have to start stocking up, folks.
[01:12:56.416 --> 01:13:01.137]  You have to get yourself as healthy as possible now, while you're still able to do certain things.
[01:13:01.516 --> 01:13:04.697]  But the most important thing is do not get the bird flu vaccine.
[01:13:05.017 --> 01:13:07.658]  When they start pushing this, you have to just say no.
[01:13:08.078 --> 01:13:13.940]  And as your neighbors are dropping dead like flies, just realize that, you know, all the things in the kitchen covered.
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:14.740]  I mean, garlic.
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:15.980]  There's so many things.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.261]  Olive leaf extract.
[01:13:17.541 --> 01:13:18.481]  Al-Qaeda-ic.
[01:13:18.501 --> 01:13:19.441]  Garlic is evil.
[01:13:19.581 --> 01:13:20.202]  Al-Qaeda-ic.
[01:13:20.522 --> 01:13:21.082]  Keep going.
[01:13:21.782 --> 01:13:24.743]  I would have as many things like that on hand as you possibly can.
[01:13:25.151 --> 01:13:32.416]  But the key thing is to get your body as cleaned out as possible because your body has the ability to basically fight anything.
[01:13:32.456 --> 01:13:35.378]  Now, of course, they're coming out with weaponized strains of these things.
[01:13:35.779 --> 01:13:40.622]  So something like a bird flu no-soap, which is a homeopathic remedy, would be very good.
[01:13:41.363 --> 01:13:43.184]  Unfortunately, you can't buy those.
[01:13:43.664 --> 01:13:44.845]  Those aren't sold to the public.
[01:13:44.885 --> 01:13:46.286]  You have to go through distributors.
[01:13:46.346 --> 01:13:48.508]  But if people call me, I'll tell you where you can get that.
[01:13:48.828 --> 01:13:51.330]  But the point is to learn what not to do.
[01:13:51.838 --> 01:13:57.620]  And, uh, you know, that involves, um, not taking aspartame, all these things that are making you sick.
[01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:01.762]  The biggest thing is, if it breaks out, don't be around anybody.
[01:14:02.902 --> 01:14:03.722]  Run to the hills.
[01:14:03.883 --> 01:14:15.907]  And that's why the British, the U.S., the Canadian troops are saying they're going to lock down the cities, even if it is in your area, yet they're going to lock you down to make sure it can get into your city, to make sure you can't get out.
[01:14:16.587 --> 01:14:18.528]  Uh, and I appreciate your call, Justin.
[01:14:18.608 --> 01:14:19.909]  Joe in California.
[01:14:19.969 --> 01:14:20.749]  Joe, you're on the air.
[01:14:21.943 --> 01:14:23.744]  Hey, hello, can you hear me?
[01:14:24.144 --> 01:14:25.724]  Yes, sir.
[01:14:25.844 --> 01:14:27.825]  Yeah, I'm happy you guys are talking about this.
[01:14:27.885 --> 01:14:36.267]  I was listening to your show the other day with the ladies that got their house or their school raided, and I wanted to ask about vaccines.
[01:14:36.668 --> 01:14:50.172]  And so I kind of was on the same thing with the guy before, but you know, when I just had a son and I said no, they asked me if they can give him the, is it the hepatitis B or hepatitis C shot?
[01:14:51.793 --> 01:14:58.278]  And is that also, I mean, are we talking like all vaccines right now are pretty much on the nose?
[01:14:58.298 --> 01:14:59.198]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:14:59.218 --> 01:15:00.839]  She's a medical doctor, but I'll give you the facts.
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:08.985]  They want to give this deadly hepatitis shot to newborn babies when you only get it from intravenous drug use or promiscuous sex.
[01:15:09.766 --> 01:15:12.908]  And it's one of the most dangerous vaccines they admit.
[01:15:13.508 --> 01:15:15.390]  And this is the one they want to shoot your baby up with.
[01:15:15.450 --> 01:15:15.690]  Doctor?
[01:15:16.658 --> 01:15:17.799]  I totally agree with you.
[01:15:18.239 --> 01:15:37.248]  As a matter of fact, through a research of a guest that was on my show, he actually spent a whole day trying to find out why did they start this insanity with Hepatitis B. And it turns out the reason was that they're taking blood for transfusion from China, from Chinese prisoners that they know is contaminated with Hepatitis B.
[01:15:37.932 --> 01:15:43.915]  So rather than stopping that blood from coming over to this country, they're starting to give the hepatitis B vaccines.
[01:15:43.935 --> 01:15:53.540]  No, no, no, no, no, that's what they admit, because Factor VIII and Bayer ship it all out, and others, and Baxter, they say, even in the literature, that we have to give everybody this because we're contaminating them.
[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:57.402]  Yes, but the point is, in fact, all vaccines are bad.
[01:15:57.482 --> 01:16:05.526]  Please, please look at the documents on my website, and as long as one of you mentioned the schools, I want to just also mention, Alex, I'm sure you're aware of this,
[01:16:05.919 --> 01:16:09.941]  That one of the plans, whenever this breaks, they're going to lock down the schools.
[01:16:10.321 --> 01:16:11.142]  Oh no, they've said that.
[01:16:11.182 --> 01:16:11.842]  That's public.
[01:16:12.202 --> 01:16:18.446]  Yes, and people are not going to... And they're going to have pastors there going, we took your children, it's of the Lord, and if you don't stand down, the preacher will go... Yes.
[01:16:18.766 --> 01:16:20.347]  And the SWAT teams open fire.
[01:16:20.567 --> 01:16:22.668]  And if this is not... And that's on the news, that's confirmed.
[01:16:22.988 --> 01:16:26.150]  And if this is not a time to start homeschooling, I don't know what is.
[01:16:26.570 --> 01:16:28.051]  Because just imagine folks
[01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:40.373]  That all of a sudden you get a notification that whatever false flag event occurred and your school has been locked down and they've shipped your child off somewhere and you can't... Oh no, we have video of FEMA drills where they bust the kids away and don't even tell the parents about it.
[01:16:40.853 --> 01:16:41.874]  So that's my whole point.
[01:16:42.154 --> 01:16:43.714]  It's just unbelievably disgusting.
[01:16:43.734 --> 01:16:44.954]  Does that answer your question, Joe?
[01:16:45.555 --> 01:16:54.477]  Well, another thing, when they did want to do that, I ran away and I thought of my buddy Alex Jones and I want to thank you for everything you do and all the information I get from all of you.
[01:16:55.236 --> 01:16:56.416]  You know, I just said no right away.
[01:16:56.436 --> 01:16:59.658]  I got that little cross-eyed from the doctor.
[01:16:59.678 --> 01:17:01.438]  You know, I got the vibe in the room.
[01:17:01.739 --> 01:17:04.760]  My wife looked at me and basically said, I trust whatever you say.
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:06.180]  And I just said no.
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:15.844]  And, um, you know, another thing that I noticed, and they did this without any information at all, and they say it's for your safety, but they clipped a little chip onto his umbilical cord.
[01:17:16.645 --> 01:17:23.749]  And what if I caught wind that, you know, they don't like, that I don't want to give my son this vaccine, and now all of a sudden I catch wind that CTS is on the way?
[01:17:23.829 --> 01:17:25.230]  No, no, no, no, that's what it's for!
[01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:26.551]  No, no, that's what, you're a prisoner!
[01:17:26.591 --> 01:17:32.414]  Look, they're saying Americans can't have gardens now, that we need police inspections, because we're probably drug dealers.
[01:17:32.794 --> 01:17:34.075]  It's total tyranny.
[01:17:34.115 --> 01:17:34.796]  Thanks for the call.
[01:17:35.356 --> 01:17:37.597]  Dr. Carley, we're going to come back in a moment with the final segment.
[01:17:37.637 --> 01:17:40.359]  Go to Stan, Simon, and Sam, and a few others, okay?
[01:17:40.379 --> 01:17:41.680]  I'm going to put you on hold, alright?
[01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:42.320]  Okay.
[01:17:43.695 --> 01:17:44.516]  This is unbelievable.
[01:17:44.556 --> 01:17:48.679]  I just wanted to remind people the Obama deception is now out at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:17:48.719 --> 01:17:53.383]  And when you know all this serious stuff, how silly is it they're worshipping Obama and think he's a good guy?
[01:17:54.645 --> 01:17:58.588]  He works for the government and the globalists and the eugenicists that are carrying this out.
[01:17:58.608 --> 01:18:00.129]  There was a revolution against tyranny.
[01:18:01.230 --> 01:18:02.171]  People were waking up.
[01:18:03.632 --> 01:18:06.255]  So they put this guy out there to sell the public on being suckered.
[01:18:07.256 --> 01:18:08.417]  I know all this sounds crazy.
[01:18:08.717 --> 01:18:09.138]  It's true.
[01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:12.821]  And I just can't believe such psychos are in control.
[01:18:12.861 --> 01:18:17.746]  But look at Hitler, look at Stalin, look at Mao, look at the Babylonians, the Romans, and the Aztecs.
[01:18:17.766 --> 01:18:18.587]  This is what elites do.
[01:18:18.607 --> 01:18:19.247]  They're crazy!
[01:18:20.088 --> 01:18:20.889]  They want control!
[01:18:20.929 --> 01:18:21.770]  They're control freaks!
[01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:27.235]  So please get The Obama Deception on DVD at Infowars.com or see it right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:18:27.315 --> 01:18:31.358]  Also, some of our sponsors that make this show possible, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:18:31.398 --> 01:18:32.620]  That's www.efoodsdirect.com.
[01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:38.014]  The letter E, foodsdirect.com, big banners up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:18:39.212 --> 01:18:41.853]  We don't have to remind you that you need to have food to survive.
[01:18:41.893 --> 01:18:46.295]  Our biggest sponsor, eFoodsDirect, is the longest continually operating storable foods company in the country.
[01:18:46.735 --> 01:18:49.937]  They also happen to be true patriots and have supported Freedom Movement for years.
[01:18:50.417 --> 01:18:57.100]  With the looming problems and the depression and all the craziness, you need this high-quality, non-GMO, clean, storable foods.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:04.303]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com and you can watch the free videos and see their brochure and all their great products and contact them and get some food, folks.
[01:19:05.143 --> 01:19:07.146]  Three day packages, two year packages, everything.

[01:19:08.327 --> 01:19:08.508]  That's 800-409-5633.
[01:19:17.984 --> 01:19:27.134]  Need to get prepared, need to get self-sufficient, and one of those fine sponsors, of course, are the folks at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:33.180]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[01:19:33.561 --> 01:19:39.106]  There have been times in American history, Pilgrim for example, when seeds had the highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold.
[01:19:39.707 --> 01:19:46.228]  The globalists are buying up all the major heirloom seed companies and non-GMO seed companies and hoarding them, not selling them.
[01:19:46.569 --> 01:19:49.809]  But the great folks at SurvivalSeedBank.com have it.
[01:19:49.889 --> 01:19:51.009]  Give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:54.650]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:58.791]  Or again, SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:19:59.191 --> 01:20:02.892]  Absolutely fabulous folks there.
[01:20:03.252 --> 01:20:06.793]  And I hope that people will take advantage of that.
[01:20:08.573 --> 01:20:20.491]  We're going to come back in the final segment and get into a few phone calls here at the end, but it just totally blows me away when we're talking about this and dealing with all this.
[01:20:22.034 --> 01:20:24.835]  And people calling me and saying, Alex, you have so much courage, you're so great.
[01:20:25.255 --> 01:20:26.315]  What does it matter?
[01:20:27.315 --> 01:20:30.356]  Everybody's got horrible allergies, people with cancer, rates are exploding.
[01:20:30.696 --> 01:20:33.476]  Used to be very rare to see a kid die of cancer, now it's everywhere.
[01:20:33.496 --> 01:20:43.598]  They're building FEMA camps, they're putting troops into all the major police departments and admitting it, and troops on the streets, and spying on everybody, and corruption, and getting ready for World War III, and all this evil.
[01:20:44.138 --> 01:20:48.299]  And they got this Obama with youth brigades, and all these gun ban bills introduced, and
[01:20:49.139 --> 01:20:54.942]  And they're demonizing Ron Paul, saying his supporters are terrorists and secret government documents we now have up on InfoWars.com.
[01:20:55.442 --> 01:20:57.804]  I mean, it's just... We gotta fight these people!
[01:20:57.844 --> 01:20:58.664]  It's all we can do!
[01:20:58.724 --> 01:20:59.004]  Come on!
[01:21:01.201 --> 01:21:03.581]  This year millions of people will lose electricity.
[01:21:03.942 --> 01:21:07.962]  Ice storms, earthquakes, flooding or hurricanes could leave you without power for days.
[01:21:08.402 --> 01:21:12.303]  Anyone that's ever been in a blackout knows that the first thing you need is a flashlight.
[01:21:12.703 --> 01:21:14.604]  That's why you need the Paclite.
[01:21:14.884 --> 01:21:19.344]  The Paclite is powered by a 9-volt battery and lasts up to 1,200 hours.
[01:21:19.684 --> 01:21:25.986]  It's so small it fits right in your pocket and glows in the dark, making it easy to find when you need it most.
[01:21:26.586 --> 01:21:27.786]  One Florida customer says,
[01:21:28.246 --> 01:21:36.313]  My Paclite has lasted through 4 hurricanes in 2 years, over 30 days without electricity and I'm still using the same battery.
[01:21:36.873 --> 01:21:40.997]  The Paclite comes with a 25 year warranty and prices start at just $12.99.
[01:21:41.517 --> 01:21:44.400]  It's time for you to be prepared with a Paclite.
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:46.742]  Visit us at 9voltlite.com.
[01:21:47.102 --> 01:21:48.803]  That's 9voltlite.com or call
[01:21:49.684 --> 01:21:51.185]  Call us today toll free at 877-715-4448.
[01:21:51.225 --> 01:21:51.526]  That's 877-715-4448.
[01:21:51.566 --> 01:21:54.628]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.123 --> 01:22:12.486]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:22:13.007 --> 01:22:19.210]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:19.511 --> 01:22:21.332]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:21.472 --> 01:22:23.873]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:23.953 --> 01:22:34.840]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:22:37.111 --> 01:22:38.392]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:38.792 --> 01:22:40.193]  It's about a one world government.
[01:22:40.653 --> 01:22:46.997]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:47.558 --> 01:22:55.343]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:55.823 --> 01:22:56.964]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:57.404 --> 01:22:58.585]  The people strike back.
[01:23:00.598 --> 01:23:01.479]  Detoxify.
[01:23:01.539 --> 01:23:06.023]  You are constantly reminded how important detoxify is to cleanse your body of dangerous toxins.
[01:23:06.143 --> 01:23:11.909]  You are also being reminded that it's important to detoxify safely and not all products will provide safe and effective results.
[01:23:12.129 --> 01:23:15.853]  It's time to clear the air and clear your body with safe and effective Keelermax.
[01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:21.017]  With the help of Nutri-A-Dine, Keeler Max will help your body to remove heavy metals, toxins and chemicals.
[01:23:21.137 --> 01:23:26.721]  The liquid zeolite formula, Humic, helps to remove chemicals, toxins and fluoride, bromine and chloride.
[01:23:26.861 --> 01:23:30.803]  Add Malignabla to stimulate these two detox and anti-cancer protection.
[01:23:30.883 --> 01:23:35.447]  Green Tea Supreme to bind ionic toxins and protecting DNA and membranes.
[01:23:35.667 --> 01:23:42.171]  And Nutra-Trala to recycle all fat and water-soluble antioxidant cellular protection enzymes and molecules.
[01:23:42.331 --> 01:23:44.573]  Keeler Max and Dr. Bill's Oral Detox.
[01:23:44.653 --> 01:23:44.873]  I think.
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:10.168]  This is an action alert, action alert, battle stations, battle stations, battle stations, InfoWarriors.
[01:24:10.808 --> 01:24:13.672]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com right now, a story by Paul Watson.
[01:24:14.012 --> 01:24:18.137]  Ron Paul, culprits of financial collapse, should be arrested.
[01:24:19.418 --> 01:24:22.839]  Not treated as saviors and given more power to fix the problem they created.
[01:24:23.319 --> 01:24:24.700]  Ron Paul's very popular.
[01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:26.340]  He's become very mainstream now.
[01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:30.341]  He's got bills to abolish the Federal Reserve, bills to audit the Federal Reserve in.
[01:24:30.622 --> 01:24:33.222]  They have a good chance of passing if we believe and get behind it.
[01:24:33.823 --> 01:24:37.544]  But bottom line, we need to learn to address the criminals and that they need to be arrested.
[01:24:37.584 --> 01:24:38.844]  Please help this story go viral.
[01:24:39.344 --> 01:24:41.365]  It's up at PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:24:41.425 --> 01:24:44.346]  Ron Paul Culprits of Financial Collapse Should Be Arrested.
[01:24:45.306 --> 01:24:48.807]  And for all people that are jealous of me and the Patriot Movement, you can just change the name.
[01:24:49.568 --> 01:24:51.408]  Just put the article out, please, with his quotes.
[01:24:51.448 --> 01:24:53.049]  You can put your name on it and say you interviewed him.
[01:24:53.129 --> 01:24:53.609]  I don't care.
[01:24:54.069 --> 01:24:55.410]  I just want to beat the bankers, okay?
[01:24:55.770 --> 01:24:57.631]  I want to expose the people because they're the eugenicists.
[01:24:57.651 --> 01:24:58.871]  They're the ones funding all of this.
[01:24:59.191 --> 01:25:00.091]  So please get it out.
[01:25:00.131 --> 01:25:00.952]  It's up there right now.
[01:25:02.353 --> 01:25:06.696]  And please don't ignore the secret police thing about Rompel Sports being terrorists because we broke it.
[01:25:07.357 --> 01:25:08.518]  It needs to get out there.
[01:25:09.158 --> 01:25:10.940]  You can change the name and say you broke it.
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:11.660]  I don't care.
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:13.402]  Just get the info out.
[01:25:13.682 --> 01:25:15.984]  You can take the scans off my site, say you broke it.
[01:25:16.124 --> 01:25:16.624]  I don't care.
[01:25:17.085 --> 01:25:19.246]  I'll say you broke it for the hundreds of you out there.
[01:25:19.306 --> 01:25:20.908]  Just please, let's work together here.
[01:25:21.408 --> 01:25:22.529]  We've got to defeat the New World Order.
[01:25:23.090 --> 01:25:25.912]  Let's take a few final calls for Dr. Carley here.
[01:25:28.074 --> 01:25:29.355]  Let's talk to Stan in Missouri.
[01:25:29.395 --> 01:25:30.235]  Stan, you're on the air.
[01:25:30.296 --> 01:25:30.596]  Welcome.
[01:25:31.044 --> 01:25:32.425]  Hello, Alex and Dr. Kelly.
[01:25:32.765 --> 01:25:36.708]  I don't think the American people are going to go along with these forced flu vaccinations.
[01:25:36.748 --> 01:25:46.094]  Dr. Kelly is more of an expert than I am on the subject, but if you knew what they put in that smallpox vaccine when they manufactured it, Alex, years ago, it'd make your hair curl.
[01:25:46.555 --> 01:25:53.639]  I had a copy of that, and I do believe that they manufactured that with horse hair and pus and just all kinds of... No, they did.
[01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:55.301]  That's what it comes from.
[01:25:55.341 --> 01:25:56.421]  It comes from cow pus, sir.
[01:25:56.481 --> 01:25:56.942]  Cow pus.
[01:25:57.002 --> 01:25:57.802]  Dr. Kelly, correct?
[01:25:58.343 --> 01:25:58.523]  Yes.
[01:25:59.707 --> 01:26:14.194]  Yes, and let me just say there's actually a book that was written almost a century ago that you can download off my website, entitled, Of Horrors of Vaccination Exposed and Illustrated, that explains everything about the smallpox vaccine and the horrors that it wreaked at that time.
[01:26:14.274 --> 01:26:15.795]  So they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:26:16.376 --> 01:26:21.418]  Alex, were you aware that Chuck Norris is going to have a meeting tomorrow night at 5 p.m.?
[01:26:21.438 --> 01:26:23.799]  It's going to be a live telecast.
[01:26:23.839 --> 01:26:24.880]  We surround them.
[01:26:25.373 --> 01:26:29.474]  Concerning the concerns of America, would you happen to know what channel that's going to be on tomorrow night?
[01:26:29.494 --> 01:26:34.355]  You know, I heard something about Chuck Norris, and I've got his contact info, and I didn't even pay attention.
[01:26:34.395 --> 01:26:36.975]  I've been on this Ron Paul people are terrorists stuff.
[01:26:37.235 --> 01:26:38.596]  What is Chuck Norris even saying?
[01:26:38.756 --> 01:26:40.716]  Well, they're going to have a bunch of cell groups.
[01:26:41.516 --> 01:26:46.857]  I don't know if they're militia groups, but they're going to be placing their concerns tomorrow night, concerns on the nation.
[01:26:47.577 --> 01:26:48.998]  And I don't know if Chuck's going to host it.
[01:26:49.018 --> 01:26:49.578]  Excuse me, cell?
[01:26:49.618 --> 01:26:50.118]  Stop, stop.
[01:26:50.838 --> 01:26:52.718]  Guys, I saw it on InfoWars yesterday.
[01:26:52.738 --> 01:26:53.479]  I didn't read it.
[01:26:53.679 --> 01:26:54.739]  What is Chuck Norris doing?
[01:26:56.058 --> 01:26:57.179]  I've got his private email.
[01:26:59.260 --> 01:26:59.861]  I can't hear him.
[01:26:59.941 --> 01:27:01.022]  I suddenly can't hear the caller.
[01:27:02.383 --> 01:27:02.823]  I'm lost.
[01:27:03.364 --> 01:27:03.584]  Yeah.
[01:27:04.224 --> 01:27:05.605]  Oh, whatever, man.
[01:27:05.725 --> 01:27:07.146]  Okay, what specifically is it?
[01:27:08.047 --> 01:27:15.853]  1,000 cell groups will be united around the country in solidarity over concerns of the nation's right-wing cell groups will meet during a live telecast.
[01:27:15.913 --> 01:27:19.636]  We surround them on Friday, March the 13th at 5 p.m.
[01:27:20.016 --> 01:27:20.917]  What does that mean?
[01:27:22.526 --> 01:27:24.006]  I mean, this is really confusing.
[01:27:24.266 --> 01:27:25.867]  I mean, we'll post something right now.
[01:27:25.887 --> 01:27:27.787]  I saw Chuck Norris is having some event.
[01:27:28.207 --> 01:27:30.368]  He's saying cell groups surround them.
[01:27:30.448 --> 01:27:31.528]  I mean, what are you saying?
[01:27:31.988 --> 01:27:40.671]  Well, I'm not sure what he's trying to say unless he's saying that the right wing militias are going to start rising up about the tyranny that's going on in this country, Alex.
[01:27:40.731 --> 01:27:41.771]  I'm not sure what he's saying.
[01:27:43.496 --> 01:27:43.816]  I better.
[01:27:43.836 --> 01:27:45.097]  I don't know why.
[01:27:45.417 --> 01:27:46.798]  I don't really bug these celebrities.
[01:27:46.958 --> 01:27:48.339]  I have his contact info.
[01:27:48.599 --> 01:27:51.361]  I wondered why Pastor Butch was calling up wanting his contact info earlier.
[01:27:51.381 --> 01:27:57.324]  I'm just trying to find out what channel this is going to be on, because I'm like you, I don't know.
[01:27:57.885 --> 01:27:59.306]  It's tomorrow night at 5 p.m.
[01:27:59.926 --> 01:28:03.248]  And where is Chuck Norris having a cell with him?
[01:28:03.388 --> 01:28:06.630]  Well, I know from my understanding that Chuck's living in Texas now.
[01:28:06.650 --> 01:28:08.211]  He's supposedly got a ranch out there.
[01:28:08.251 --> 01:28:08.511]  No, no, no.
[01:28:08.551 --> 01:28:10.352]  He's got one by Houston and by Austin.
[01:28:10.372 --> 01:28:11.233]  We're going to go into overdrive.
[01:28:11.253 --> 01:28:12.554]  Can we go into overdrive, guys?
[01:28:14.012 --> 01:28:14.672]  Okay, thank you.
[01:28:14.732 --> 01:28:15.913]  Dr. Carley, thank you.
[01:28:16.393 --> 01:28:18.214]  Again, I can't keep track of everything.
[01:28:18.494 --> 01:28:21.515]  It's an InfoWars story, and it's mainstream news.
[01:28:22.375 --> 01:28:23.816]  The Examiner out of England.
[01:28:24.316 --> 01:28:26.217]  And you won't hear this on the AM and FM, folks.
[01:28:26.257 --> 01:28:29.318]  It'll be on the internet streams at InfoWars.com only.
[01:28:29.538 --> 01:28:30.439]  Thank you, Dr. Carley.
[01:28:30.919 --> 01:28:31.999]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:28:32.519 --> 01:28:32.839]  You bet.
[01:28:32.879 --> 01:28:33.620]  Take care.
[01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:37.361]  We're going to go to break for one minute here, and then I'm going to cover this Shell Group thing.
[01:28:37.441 --> 01:28:39.222]  InfoWars.com streams only.
[01:28:41.917 --> 01:28:43.703]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:28:45.168 --> 01:28:47.375]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:28:50.384 --> 01:28:51.945]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:28:52.085 --> 01:28:56.709]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:28:56.809 --> 01:28:59.571]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:28:59.791 --> 01:29:02.653]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:29:02.833 --> 01:29:08.718]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:29:08.918 --> 01:29:11.820]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:19.023]  Email efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:29:19.143 --> 01:29:22.244]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:29:22.404 --> 01:29:22.604]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:29:22.664 --> 01:29:24.285]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[01:29:27.546 --> 01:29:33.632]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:29:33.812 --> 01:29:37.556]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:29:37.576 --> 01:29:39.078]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:29:39.118 --> 01:29:39.538]  Take action today.
[01:29:39.578 --> 01:29:41.540]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:29:59.907 --> 01:30:13.074]  Okay, I got so distracted with the fact that they're teaching the state police that Ron Paul supporters are terrorists, and I got so distracted with
[01:30:16.929 --> 01:30:20.993]  Everything else going on around here in the Obama deception release, and in my gut, I knew we had to release it early.
[01:30:21.834 --> 01:30:25.257]  And now I'm reading mainstream news, which we had it up yesterday, I just missed it.
[01:30:25.277 --> 01:30:37.988]  The call by some right-wing leaders for rebellion and the military to refuse the commander-in-chief's orders is joined by Chuck Norris, who claims that thousands of right-wing shell groups have organized and are ready for a second American Revolution during an appearance on the Glenn Beck Show.
[01:30:38.028 --> 01:30:40.090]  I told you he's been doing some weird psy-op, Glenn Beck.
[01:30:40.951 --> 01:30:45.955]  He promised that if things ever get worse from this point of view, he may run for President of Texas.
[01:30:46.315 --> 01:30:55.101]  The martial artist actor claims that Texas were never formally part of the United States in the first place and the rebellion is to come through secession, Texas would lead the way.
[01:30:55.521 --> 01:30:57.422]  So we have all these states declaring secession.
[01:30:57.482 --> 01:31:00.725]  I think this is a way to make themselves, a way to co-opt it or something.
[01:31:00.745 --> 01:31:02.866]  I'm not saying Norris is bad, but he may be being used here.
[01:31:03.246 --> 01:31:09.591]  Today in a Syndicated Column on WorldNet Daily, Norris reiterates the point, they may need to be a reality sooner than we think.
[01:31:10.171 --> 01:31:10.952]  You know what, guys?
[01:31:11.732 --> 01:31:20.579]  Go to Infowars.com right now and play my director clip, six minutes, where I reach out to everybody, print me this article.
[01:31:20.699 --> 01:31:22.741]  I have to read it and analyze it.
[01:31:22.761 --> 01:31:26.543]  I think I know what this is, but I have to read it before I give a comment on it.
[01:31:26.564 --> 01:31:31.127]  So go to Infowars.com right now on the main page.
[01:31:32.748 --> 01:31:34.289]  Yeah, that's just the Chuck Norris article.
[01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:35.090]  Skip that.
[01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:35.931]  Just print that for me.
[01:31:36.571 --> 01:31:38.312]  And then go to Infowars.com.
[01:31:41.684 --> 01:31:42.324]  The main page.
[01:31:43.225 --> 01:31:46.687]  And click on Alex Reaches Out to Obama Supporters.
[01:31:46.707 --> 01:31:48.128]  I'm going to play that for six minutes.
[01:31:49.869 --> 01:31:57.434]  And then I want to... Or you can also... I mean, it's on the main page.
[01:31:57.474 --> 01:31:58.115]  You can't miss it.
[01:31:58.135 --> 01:32:05.660]  I need to get more than one computer in there hooked into the feed net so we can do things better than this because it's shutting down and they're on me.
[01:32:08.742 --> 01:32:09.682]  Just run music for a while.
[01:32:09.702 --> 01:32:10.323]  I'll be back in a little while.
[01:32:16.292 --> 01:32:19.778]  We're good to go.
[01:32:41.867 --> 01:33:06.193]  All those drifter's days are past me now I've got so much more to think about Deadlines and commitments What to leave in, what to leave out Against the wind We were running against the wind
[01:33:22.856 --> 01:33:28.137]  You can't turn your head You can't rip your wings
[01:34:03.854 --> 01:34:30.354]  Lovin' is lovin' The moment is right It's worth all the years in the past So one more night Get away from the blind side of life Honey, I want you to be by my side
[01:34:32.287 --> 01:34:55.696]  Me and my back just moves and no more, no more Get away from the blind side of life Honey, I want you to be by my side Me and my back just moves and no more, no more
[01:35:36.753 --> 01:35:41.535]  Get away from the bright side of life.
[01:35:42.615 --> 01:35:45.896]  Honey, I want you to be by my side.
[01:35:46.396 --> 01:35:50.278]  Me and my backdrop won't set no more.
[01:35:50.298 --> 01:35:51.718]  No more.
[01:35:51.918 --> 01:35:55.079]  Goodnight, my darling.
[01:35:55.219 --> 01:36:02.702]  Another day has passed.
[01:36:03.062 --> 01:36:05.323]  Forget all those painful memories.
[01:36:16.091 --> 01:36:18.712]  Come to me, baby.
[01:36:18.933 --> 01:36:21.955]  Come to me one more time.
[01:36:21.975 --> 01:36:24.857]  The time we got moving.
[01:36:24.897 --> 01:36:29.100]  Time to move on.
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:31.942]  Let's slide out the door.
[01:36:31.982 --> 01:36:35.985]  Let's slide out the door.
[01:36:49.282 --> 01:36:51.032]  Let's go, let's go!
[01:37:25.723 --> 01:37:30.171]  In the past, I said things would happen once a year or so that were key trigger points.
[01:37:31.733 --> 01:37:32.995]  And I've always known that Chuck...
[01:37:34.648 --> 01:37:37.190]  Chuck Norris would wind up being important in this whole equation.
[01:37:37.890 --> 01:37:58.122]  Chuck Norris told me privately off air during breaks, and actually you were witnesses to it, we didn't put it out over air, remember, that he's actually a big fan, he knows about all this stuff, but he can't get into it because of his position, that he's woken up to the New World Order, that he didn't really believe me totally ten years ago, but he has a place outside Austin and a ranch outside Houston.
[01:37:58.162 --> 01:37:59.943]  Folks really don't know he has that place.
[01:38:00.264 --> 01:38:01.124]  Well, I'm not going to get into it.
[01:38:01.144 --> 01:38:03.746]  The point is, and he gave me his wife's email,
[01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:10.906]  And said, contact him there, he'd like to come back on, and that, you know, things kept getting worse, he would basically come out more.
[01:38:11.167 --> 01:38:12.611]  Well, I haven't messed with him since then.
[01:38:14.332 --> 01:38:19.196]  And then about a month ago, months after I interviewed him for the first time, I never liked this.
[01:38:19.416 --> 01:38:21.938]  I, like, two in the morning I was trying to go to sleep and I said, no!
[01:38:22.838 --> 01:38:30.384]  That Chuck Norris book he sent me, it's got his email address written in it, and I've never contacted him, and I need to go find that book in the house.
[01:38:30.424 --> 01:38:33.847]  And I dug around and found it, and I gave it to my producer and said, put this in the computer.
[01:38:34.407 --> 01:38:36.889]  I need to be in contact with him, and I just never got around to it.
[01:38:36.909 --> 01:38:38.150]  I was making the Obama deception.
[01:38:40.985 --> 01:38:53.715]  And then I've been watching this Glenn Beck situation, and who said put Ron Paul supporters in prison, use the military against them, basically the talking points from this.
[01:38:53.895 --> 01:38:55.537]  I saw, you know, these government documents.
[01:38:56.478 --> 01:38:58.419]  I knew it was a talking point because they were saying the same thing here.
[01:38:58.459 --> 01:39:02.522]  We're terrorists, we want to kill the police, we're Ron Paul supporters, we believe in an imaginary New World Order.
[01:39:02.903 --> 01:39:07.206]  Then suddenly Beck started saying he believes in a New World Order, but then he always slips in other propaganda.
[01:39:07.306 --> 01:39:08.087]  I know Beck's bad.
[01:39:09.837 --> 01:39:19.819]  I don't think Chuck Norris is bad, and I think he's... So he has come out and said, get ready for revolution, and it's just wild, and I think he might be being set up here.
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.621]  I mean, I really don't think this guy's an evil person.
[01:39:30.441 --> 01:39:37.322]  I think he's been galled by the fake right-wing system, and now he realizes Obama and the New World Order is real, and that's what he's saying, and so he's saying he's going to fight it,
[01:39:39.878 --> 01:39:42.680]  Go ahead and play this little 6 minute clip where I talk to the Obama supporters.
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:46.643]  I want to focus on this more and really write some notes and make this very concise.
[01:39:46.663 --> 01:39:50.246]  This is a huge DLC and I can't catch every football.
[01:39:50.266 --> 01:39:55.771]  It's like 10 of them are getting thrown at me every second and I'm dropping them all the time and I saw something Chuck Norris is going to make a big announcement.
[01:39:56.752 --> 01:39:58.233]  And is he making it on Turkey's show?
[01:39:58.313 --> 01:40:00.154]  Print me the World Net Daily thing too.
[01:40:00.835 --> 01:40:01.876]  It's linked in this story.
[01:40:03.339 --> 01:40:06.621]  Then we had computers shut down and have problems right in the middle of this.
[01:40:06.641 --> 01:40:07.621]  We went into overdrive.
[01:40:07.661 --> 01:40:09.242]  So, Cruz doing a great job.
[01:40:10.082 --> 01:40:11.323]  That's why I'm having trouble printing these.
[01:40:15.545 --> 01:40:17.646]  He's saying, revolution may happen sooner than we think.
[01:40:17.686 --> 01:40:18.226]  It's not me.
[01:40:18.266 --> 01:40:23.028]  Someone someday may again be running for president.
[01:40:23.048 --> 01:40:25.189]  But then he talks about Texas leaving.
[01:40:25.529 --> 01:40:26.970]  There's all these states talking about it.
[01:40:29.531 --> 01:40:33.094]  He talks about cell groups around the country and solidarity over the concerns of our nation.
[01:40:34.074 --> 01:40:37.437]  The right-wing cells will be meeting during a live telecast.
[01:40:37.477 --> 01:40:38.198]  We surround them.
[01:40:42.561 --> 01:40:48.325]  And so he's saying, we know the New World Order is taking over, but there's more of us than there are of you.
[01:40:48.345 --> 01:40:49.406]  That's what Mark Kornke always says.
[01:40:49.446 --> 01:40:50.147]  We surround you.
[01:40:50.167 --> 01:40:51.328]  It's like moose hunting.
[01:40:51.668 --> 01:40:55.311]  He closed with the words of Sam Houston, followed by a plug for his next martial arts event.
[01:40:55.711 --> 01:40:58.093]  We view ourselves on the eve of battle.
[01:40:59.585 --> 01:41:01.126]  Chuck Norris has never acted like this.
[01:41:03.927 --> 01:41:04.887]  This is what happens though.
[01:41:05.047 --> 01:41:07.688]  I basically deprogrammed people and he told me that.
[01:41:07.728 --> 01:41:08.768]  You guys were in there.
[01:41:08.788 --> 01:41:11.049]  Hey guys!
[01:41:11.069 --> 01:41:12.390]  There were two of you in there at the time.
[01:41:12.450 --> 01:41:15.631]  I know it was Hoos and Bill were in there.
[01:41:16.011 --> 01:41:18.872]  And of course during the break I could have put it out on air but I didn't.
[01:41:18.892 --> 01:41:20.292]  We didn't record it because we're nice guys.
[01:41:20.312 --> 01:41:21.453]  We don't talk to people and record them.
[01:41:22.222 --> 01:41:25.784]  You know, it's just to know, he's like, yes, I know all about it.
[01:41:25.804 --> 01:41:27.285]  I just haven't been thinking how to go public.
[01:41:27.646 --> 01:41:29.627]  And then now to have it happening right here.
[01:41:31.048 --> 01:41:33.329]  But I don't trust Beck being involved in all this.
[01:41:33.349 --> 01:41:36.051]  You guys print me The World Night Daily, did you find it?
[01:41:37.352 --> 01:41:38.693]  All you do is go to this article.
[01:41:38.713 --> 01:41:40.274]  I need to get my computer in here print-enabled.
[01:41:40.294 --> 01:41:40.994]  Can we just do that?
[01:41:42.175 --> 01:41:45.097]  Because I've been, I'm not bitching, but I mean, I've asked and asked and asked.
[01:41:45.597 --> 01:41:46.798]  It's like I'm a Chinese emperor.
[01:41:46.858 --> 01:41:47.939]  I can't cut my fingernails here.
[01:41:47.959 --> 01:41:48.939]  Everything's done by you guys.
[01:41:51.069 --> 01:41:52.150]  I just need the World Net Daily.
[01:41:52.170 --> 01:41:54.611]  Because I want to read that too.
[01:41:54.651 --> 01:41:55.692]  I need to analyze this.
[01:41:56.152 --> 01:41:58.913]  Are you guys ready to play the six minute clip and I can figure it out during that period?
[01:41:59.274 --> 01:42:00.074]  Okay, great job.
[01:42:00.114 --> 01:42:01.055]  Then I'll come back and do that.
[01:42:01.075 --> 01:42:03.836]  I've got other radio interviews I've got to do, but I'm about to cancel those.
[01:42:05.957 --> 01:42:07.658]  Oh, where's the folder of radio interviews?
[01:42:07.838 --> 01:42:08.899]  Folks, welcome to my world.
[01:42:08.919 --> 01:42:09.820]  I mean, this is what I do.
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:10.920]  This is what it's like.
[01:42:11.420 --> 01:42:12.461]  And it's all coming to a head.
[01:42:12.521 --> 01:42:13.902]  Everything is quickening right now.
[01:42:13.922 --> 01:42:18.344]  I've got a folder here with my guest list.
[01:42:18.845 --> 01:42:19.165]  Here it is.
[01:42:22.410 --> 01:42:24.811]  Okay, Uncle Nasty Libertarian Talk Show.
[01:42:24.831 --> 01:42:31.074]  And then I'm doing a show out of Indiana on Talk Station.
[01:42:32.515 --> 01:42:33.575]  When is this interview?
[01:42:33.595 --> 01:42:35.816]  We have to multitask.
[01:42:35.836 --> 01:42:37.417]  I have to do this on air, folks.
[01:42:38.938 --> 01:42:39.718]  That's bizarre.
[01:42:39.738 --> 01:42:43.460]  They've got yesterday's interviews in that one.
[01:42:45.321 --> 01:42:46.601]  Okay, it's at 4 o'clock.
[01:42:46.641 --> 01:42:47.422]  I've got time for that.
[01:42:50.076 --> 01:42:52.217]  You know what, I want to give a proper analysis of this.
[01:42:52.998 --> 01:42:54.638]  So I need those stories, I need to take a break.
[01:42:54.898 --> 01:42:56.939]  Let's go ahead and roll this clip.
[01:42:56.979 --> 01:43:00.641]  Obama Deception Director Alex Jones reaches out to Obama supporters.
[01:43:01.582 --> 01:43:05.383]  Because if we just attack them from a right-wing perspective, it'll get them more in their core support of Obama.
[01:43:05.784 --> 01:43:07.985]  I believe the leader wanting to foment violent revolution.
[01:43:08.045 --> 01:43:09.325]  I've been saying that, we know they do.
[01:43:10.126 --> 01:43:12.347]  And this is just, it's all getting out of control.
[01:43:12.367 --> 01:43:15.988]  Because if Chuck Norris tells people to start a shooting war, it'll happen.
[01:43:16.008 --> 01:43:16.969]  Okay?
[01:43:21.089 --> 01:43:21.789]  Good God.
[01:43:22.690 --> 01:43:28.232]  You know, I remember when I was told ten years ago by state police and police in Dallas that Chuck Norris was a huge fan.
[01:43:28.753 --> 01:43:43.540]  And then I actually got contacted and talked to him and then I never bugged him again and then talked to him again and found out he's been listening for that long and knows all about it but doesn't go completely public.
[01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:43.980]  Thank you.
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:46.361]  Alright, I'm going to go mark these articles up, read them.
[01:43:52.563 --> 01:43:54.524]  No, this is not the Chuck Norris article.
[01:43:56.565 --> 01:44:01.887]  What you do is you go to Chuck Norris claims thousands of right-wing cell groups exist and rebel against America.
[01:44:02.287 --> 01:44:04.708]  It's the third paragraph down is the link to the World Net Daily.
[01:44:06.769 --> 01:44:09.951]  I mean, I just googled Chuck Norris cell groups and it came up.
[01:44:11.311 --> 01:44:11.812]  I'll come to it.
[01:44:12.092 --> 01:44:14.453]  Go ahead and play the clip, please, guys, and we'll be right back.
[01:44:14.473 --> 01:44:14.853]  Stay with us.
[01:44:14.873 --> 01:44:16.574]  This is a very important transmission.
[01:44:16.614 --> 01:44:17.194]  Please stay with us.
[01:44:17.214 --> 01:44:18.655]  Call everybody you know to tune in right now.
[01:44:18.915 --> 01:44:21.076]  TheInfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Streams, here it is.
[01:44:34.707 --> 01:44:40.673]  The Obama deception is about who the real Barack Obama is, not the right-wing version or the left-wing version.
[01:44:40.713 --> 01:44:41.594]  We cut through all that.
[01:44:41.614 --> 01:44:46.799]  We show who's financed him, the lies he is told, and what his real agenda is.
[01:44:50.609 --> 01:44:57.238]  The Obama deception will be the first major documentary put out after his election that is critical.
[01:44:57.658 --> 01:45:03.245]  All the right-wing guys are still making films about, is he really from Kenya or is he a communist?
[01:45:03.626 --> 01:45:07.371]  We're not touching any of those red herrings, whether they're true or not.
[01:45:07.671 --> 01:45:08.873]  We don't know, we can't prove it.
[01:45:09.233 --> 01:45:12.275]  We do know he lied about keeping troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:45:12.455 --> 01:45:14.916]  We do know he lied about warrantless wiretapping.
[01:45:14.956 --> 01:45:17.117]  We do know he lied about shutting down camps.
[01:45:17.577 --> 01:45:20.659]  We do know that he lied about getting rid of NAFTA and GATT and is now expanding it.
[01:45:21.039 --> 01:45:29.023]  And so this film is about Obama being a puppet, who he works for, and then we get past the puppet to the real agenda of his controllers.
[01:45:31.092 --> 01:45:33.374]  Barack Obama is controlled by offshore banks.
[01:45:33.794 --> 01:45:44.904]  This film details how they bankrupt the world economy, how they control the currencies of the planet, and how the bankers want to destroy the economy so they can buy everything up for pennies on the dollar.
[01:45:45.204 --> 01:45:47.887]  That's why the Obama deception is so important.
[01:45:48.127 --> 01:45:49.588]  Because it gives you the master plan.
[01:45:49.628 --> 01:45:51.870]  It gives you the big overarching agenda.
[01:45:52.090 --> 01:45:54.853]  So you understand how the world really works and where this planet's going.
[01:45:55.213 --> 01:45:56.995]  And it gives you, the viewer, the choice
[01:45:57.555 --> 01:46:13.853]  To be conned, to be a sucker by the Republicans, the Russian Limbaughs on the right, and by the controlled left, the Obamas, or whether you want to finally break the spell, break the paradigm, and realize they're all bought and paid for, and the real enemy are these private banks running these giant Ponzi schemes.
[01:46:22.699 --> 01:46:33.568]  When the public finds out they've had their entire futures robbed, when they find out that a total tyranny has been brought into place, they are going to get so angry, the elite has to bring in the police state.
[01:46:33.768 --> 01:46:35.730]  They have to put regular army troops on the streets.
[01:46:35.970 --> 01:46:37.291]  They have to have FEMA camps.
[01:46:37.491 --> 01:46:40.894]  They have to get rid of habeas corpus and have secret arrests.
[01:46:41.214 --> 01:46:47.820]  Because the public is going to be in open revolt, and the government admits they're gearing up to use the military against the American people.
[01:46:50.493 --> 01:47:02.952]  Six months before Obama was elected, when he was still an underdog, we had figured out that he was the heir apparent, that he was the anointed one, that he was the special person that the elite was going to put in power to sell the public on their agenda.
[01:47:03.413 --> 01:47:04.755]  Then I saw how the media
[01:47:05.922 --> 01:47:08.023]  Was getting behind him in such a unified way.
[01:47:08.063 --> 01:47:11.924]  And I knew the media likes to pose as liberal or conservative, but really they're owned by the bomb makers.
[01:47:11.964 --> 01:47:14.165]  They're owned by the military industrial complex and the big banks.
[01:47:14.405 --> 01:47:17.146]  So they had to come in with a Madison Avenue fraud.
[01:47:17.446 --> 01:47:21.387]  They had to put a black face on the New World Order as KRS-One.
[01:47:21.627 --> 01:47:32.711]  And Webster Tarpley and many others have said they had to give people a stake in it with just the surface packaging of, oh look, he's black, things have changed, you know, everything's okay, stand down.
[01:47:33.091 --> 01:47:35.692]  This is an attempt to suppress revolution.
[01:47:35.892 --> 01:47:41.435]  This is an attempt to suppress a massive renaissance taking place worldwide for the globalist tyranny.
[01:47:41.835 --> 01:47:44.116]  And so that's why we've made the Obama Deception.
[01:47:44.496 --> 01:47:50.138]  And that's why we're asking listeners and viewers to get the film, to make copies of it, to get it out to everyone they know.
[01:47:53.723 --> 01:47:57.809]  And one thing I want to make clear, I respect Barack Obama's supporters.
[01:47:58.790 --> 01:48:07.522]  Their fervent support of him wasn't so much about Obama, it was about a repudiation of George Bush, clearly stealing two elections.
[01:48:08.303 --> 01:48:08.803]  Clearly
[01:48:10.163 --> 01:48:13.504]  Attacking the Constitution and Bill of Rights from one end to the other.
[01:48:14.045 --> 01:48:18.086]  And lying about WMDs and all these wars and the million-plus dead Iraqis.
[01:48:18.746 --> 01:48:20.887]  The American people don't like all this being done in their name.
[01:48:21.147 --> 01:48:23.768]  So they were desperate for somebody who promised to change it.
[01:48:24.268 --> 01:48:26.709]  But as soon as he got in, he flip-flopped on all of it.
[01:48:27.550 --> 01:48:28.550]  But he didn't just stop there.
[01:48:29.130 --> 01:48:31.011]  He then accelerated the whole program.
[01:48:34.457 --> 01:48:42.122]  This film is reaching out to people that are supporting Barack Obama, and it's saying, please, just take the time out to watch this film.
[01:48:42.562 --> 01:48:45.584]  Take the time out, write down notes, research the claims we make.
[01:48:45.985 --> 01:48:48.907]  We're saying that no matter who's in office, this agenda continues.
[01:48:49.267 --> 01:49:04.337]  And until we address the power behind the throne, until we address these roundtables, these private banking consortiums, these corporate systems that have taken over our governments, just like they take over other corporations in a hostile takeover, until we address that, nothing's going to get better.
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:15.244]  The elite saw a revolution brewing in the United States and all over the world against globalism and the globalist agenda.
[01:49:16.724 --> 01:49:18.846]  We can actually use the hype of Obama.
[01:49:18.866 --> 01:49:27.131]  We can actually use his betrayal to once and for all wake up the people and shatter the false left-right paradigm forever.
[01:49:29.052 --> 01:49:32.494]  You know, I get passionate when I talk about
[01:49:45.162 --> 01:49:48.808]  Okay, we're live here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:56.087 --> 01:50:14.939]  Okay, now, again, I've been seeing something form, something develop with Glenn Beck, who's shed, put Ron Paul supporters in prison, used the military against them, 9-11 traffickers are scum, their families are scum, and then he'll say, I want to fight the New World Order, we've got to fight Iran to do that, and Iran's got nukes and is going to nuke us, and boy, I'm scared of the babas and their guns.
[01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:21.944]  And so he basically introduces everything that's in these federal intelligence reports where they say, anybody who loves freedom is a terrorist, that we've been covering.
[01:50:23.427 --> 01:50:30.451]  And I did get his WorldNetDaily story, which we're going to punch up on screen right here.
[01:50:38.635 --> 01:50:40.016]  Go over that article for folks.
[01:50:40.797 --> 01:50:43.939]  But here's the Examiner newspaper out of the UK reporting on it.
[01:50:43.959 --> 01:50:48.342]  Chuck Norris claims thousands of right-wing cell groups exist and rebel against the U.S.
[01:50:48.382 --> 01:50:48.642]  government.
[01:50:48.842 --> 01:50:59.730]  See, they want to make it, and I'm not saying Chuck's doing this, a left-wing, right-wing thing so the Obama people will circle around him and they can say it's a right-wing attack instead of, no, the bankers own both parties.
[01:51:00.211 --> 01:51:03.033]  See, Norris came out and repudiated Bush and
[01:51:05.211 --> 01:51:08.895]  Obama and got into big new world order picture immediately that would happen.
[01:51:09.355 --> 01:51:14.400]  Reading over a lot of what he has to say there's some of that, but that's not everything that's in there.
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:15.662]  But let me just read the examiner.
[01:51:15.682 --> 01:51:27.093]  You know I can't print my stories at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com because if they have 300 comments on them it's like 100 pages and we don't have printer friendly versions on Infowars and PrisonPlanet.
[01:51:27.133 --> 01:51:28.755]  I don't know why I've asked for it but we don't have it.
[01:51:29.454 --> 01:51:32.238]  And so I've been trying to print the article so I can actually read it here on air.
[01:51:32.298 --> 01:51:32.719]  Thank you.
[01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:35.303]  During this 12 ring circus that's going on.
[01:51:35.824 --> 01:51:36.885]  But they call...
[01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:40.502]  Well, let me read the editor's note from Curt Nemo first.
[01:51:40.562 --> 01:51:45.605]  The following article is an example of how far we have drifted from our constitutional principles in this country.
[01:51:45.625 --> 01:51:51.609]  The author of this article seems to think reclaiming the country in the name of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights is a right-wing concept.
[01:51:51.989 --> 01:51:55.912]  If we follow this logic, then the left-wing wants tyranny, dictatorship, and the police state.
[01:51:55.932 --> 01:51:58.934]  In fact, it seems Chuck Norris is moving away from the Republican Party.
[01:51:58.974 --> 01:52:06.919]  In his article on WorldNetDaily, link below, he claims there is a little difference between the two parties and is calling for a second American Revolution.
[01:52:06.939 --> 01:52:07.820]  So he's getting it right.
[01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:11.742]  If this is right-wing, count me in, says Kurt Neumo.
[01:52:12.483 --> 01:52:18.627]  The call by some right-wing leaders for rebellion and the military to refuse the commander-in-chief's orders is joined by Chuck Norris.
[01:52:19.348 --> 01:52:22.069]  Globalist will just stage a terror attack and then the military will get in line.
[01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:26.652]  He claims that thousands of right-wing cell groups have organized and is ready for a second American Revolution.
[01:52:27.033 --> 01:52:34.418]  During an appearance on the Glenn Beck radio show, he promised that if things get any worse, from this point of view, he may run for president of Texas.
[01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:40.656]  The martial arts activist claims that Texas was never formally part of the United States.
[01:52:40.716 --> 01:52:41.457]  Well, that's a fact.
[01:52:41.477 --> 01:52:42.378]  It's a Lone Star State.
[01:52:42.538 --> 01:52:43.639]  By treaty signed in.
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:49.466]  The United States is the first place and that rebellion is to come through secession.
[01:52:49.526 --> 01:52:50.527]  Texas would lead the way.
[01:52:51.508 --> 01:52:53.551]  This is a syndicated column on WorldNetDaily.
[01:52:53.611 --> 01:52:55.053]  Norris reiterates the point that
[01:52:57.279 --> 01:52:59.599]  Need may be a reality sooner than we think.
[01:52:59.739 --> 01:53:04.620]  If not me, someone, somebody may again be running for President of the Lone Star State.
[01:53:05.461 --> 01:53:08.981]  The State of the Union, they went and killed folks that tried that previously in Texas.
[01:53:09.541 --> 01:53:12.962]  The State of the Union continues to turn into the enemy of the state.
[01:53:16.043 --> 01:53:18.103]  He continues calling on a Second American Revolution.
[01:53:18.143 --> 01:53:22.844]  We've bastardized the First Amendment, reinterpreted America's religious history, and
[01:53:24.051 --> 01:53:30.442]  Secularize our society until we ooze skepticism and circumvent religion on every level in public-private life.
[01:53:30.502 --> 01:53:31.583]  Why not about the FEMA camps?
[01:53:31.603 --> 01:53:33.747]  Why not about the troops standing about to take over?
[01:53:34.548 --> 01:53:36.471]  How much more will Americans take?
[01:53:37.745 --> 01:53:38.946]  When will enough be enough?
[01:53:39.166 --> 01:53:46.631]  And when that time comes, will our leaders finally listen, or will history need to record a second American Revolution?
[01:53:46.671 --> 01:53:58.739]  We the people have the authority, according to American Declaration of Independence, which states that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute a new government.
[01:53:59.139 --> 01:54:05.583]  Norris claims that thousands of cell groups have been united around the country in solidarity over the concerns of our nation.
[01:54:05.983 --> 01:54:08.185]  The right-wing cells will meet during a live telecast.
[01:54:08.205 --> 01:54:11.207]  So the right-wing cells helped bring in the whole police state Obama is now using.
[01:54:12.128 --> 01:54:14.990]  We surround them on Friday, March 13th at 5 p.m.
[01:54:15.070 --> 01:54:15.330]  Where?
[01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:19.232]  He closes with the words of Sam Houston, followed by a plug.
[01:54:19.552 --> 01:54:20.332]  And it goes on.
[01:54:20.793 --> 01:54:22.554]  We view ourselves on the eve of battle.
[01:54:22.974 --> 01:54:24.275]  I mean, what is this telecast?
[01:54:24.295 --> 01:54:24.915]  Where is that?
[01:54:25.395 --> 01:54:28.797]  In the article, what is it linked to when he talks about the telecast?
[01:54:29.497 --> 01:54:36.461]  Just, uh, Control-F search, telecast, and pull up that link off the page for me, please.
[01:54:37.802 --> 01:54:41.284]  You just hit Control-F and a box will open and you can enter that and you can find it for me.
[01:54:42.659 --> 01:54:45.589]  Or I could start surfing it, but you guys are in control of that page right now.
[01:54:55.026 --> 01:55:02.071]  And it goes on to say, on the Glenn Beck Radio Show last week, I quipped in response to our wayward federal government, I may run for President of Texas.
[01:55:03.211 --> 01:55:04.972]  That may be a reality sooner than we think.
[01:55:05.453 --> 01:55:06.954]  If not for me, someone may do it.
[01:55:06.974 --> 01:55:13.578]  And going on, from the east coast to the left coast, America seems to be moving further and further from its founders' vision of government.
[01:55:14.098 --> 01:55:23.624]  George Washington advised, the great rule of conduct in regard to foreign nations is extending our commercial relations and having them
[01:55:25.023 --> 01:55:29.764]  As little political connection as possible, yet the Obama Administration just pledged $900 million in U.S.
[01:55:29.804 --> 01:55:38.906]  taxpayer fund aid to Hamas-controlled Gaza and Mahmoud Abbas-Palestinian authorities, which is more... See, that's exactly what Glenn Beck does.
[01:55:40.647 --> 01:55:41.747]  We're fighting the New World Order!
[01:55:41.847 --> 01:55:42.667]  It's the Muslims!
[01:55:43.487 --> 01:55:46.788]  When the radical Muslims are controlled and funded, the fake Al-Qaeda groups.
[01:55:48.348 --> 01:55:49.249]  Yeah, we surround them.
[01:55:49.269 --> 01:55:50.749]  Just click on the We Surround Them link.
[01:55:51.738 --> 01:55:52.398]  That's Glenn Beck.
[01:55:52.438 --> 01:55:54.259]  He's going to do it on Glenn Beck, I guess, today.
[01:55:54.299 --> 01:55:55.220]  How ridiculous.
[01:55:57.221 --> 01:55:59.543]  Glenn Beck is hosting a nationwide event called We Surround Them.
[01:55:59.603 --> 01:56:00.623]  Go here for more information.
[01:56:01.203 --> 01:56:01.844]  So that's it.
[01:56:01.864 --> 01:56:03.365]  I don't know how I missed this for a day.
[01:56:04.545 --> 01:56:05.666]  Ladies and gentlemen, oh look!
[01:56:05.726 --> 01:56:07.267]  It's the snake!
[01:56:07.807 --> 01:56:19.074]  Now, the federally written document that says Ron Paul's a terrorist, that Glenn Beck reads off of, now saying he's Ron Paul's best friend, they show that snake.
[01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:23.853]  Right here, just another type of it.
[01:56:30.119 --> 01:56:34.002]  They show that snake and say Ron Paul is basically evil and bad.
[01:56:34.042 --> 01:56:36.845]  In fact, there's Ron Paul and Campaign for Liberty are all terrorists right here.
[01:56:37.385 --> 01:56:38.486]  So this is clearly
[01:56:39.815 --> 01:56:49.298]  Glenn Beck, I told you weeks ago, I have a really bad feeling about Glenn Beck, and he's trying to become the leader of this, but then he always says, there's a new order, we've got to fight it, the Russians are going to get us.
[01:56:49.358 --> 01:56:52.220]  Like, there's a new order, global banks are taking over, and it's the Russians!
[01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:54.820]  There's a new order, global banks, and it's the Muslims!
[01:56:55.621 --> 01:56:57.381]  And see, that's what Chuck Norris says here.
[01:56:57.642 --> 01:56:58.702]  You know, I want to think, Chuck,
[01:57:00.939 --> 01:57:08.383]  is a good guy, but they know revolution's afoot against the New World Order and they want to control it and make it a fake right-wing thing so they can play it off in a left-right paradigm.
[01:57:08.403 --> 01:57:12.304]  The only revolution that will defeat the bankers is admitting they control both parties.
[01:57:13.325 --> 01:57:14.125]  You understand that?
[01:57:15.226 --> 01:57:15.906]  Oh my God.
[01:57:16.366 --> 01:57:17.707]  How can I even go home and see my kids?
[01:57:17.727 --> 01:57:18.908]  I've got to stay and work on this.
[01:57:19.008 --> 01:57:22.029]  In fact, cancel that next Libertarian radio show.
[01:57:23.130 --> 01:57:25.111]  I'm not going on that right now.
[01:57:25.131 --> 01:57:25.991]  I'll have to reschedule it.
[01:57:26.011 --> 01:57:27.552]  I don't care if they don't want to have me back on.
[01:57:29.172 --> 01:57:33.734]  Because I've got to really analyze this and go through it, and now that I read, I knew I had to read his full comments.
[01:57:36.396 --> 01:57:37.977]  And sure enough, that's what it is.
[01:57:38.737 --> 01:57:41.038]  Obama's not a traitor because he's introduced all these gun bills.
[01:57:41.078 --> 01:57:43.399]  Obama's not a traitor because he's bringing us into the New World Order.
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:48.062]  Obama's a traitor because they're going to give money to rebuild some sewage stuff for PR.
[01:57:48.102 --> 01:57:51.184]  They kill the Muslims, destroy them, and then come in with UN control.
[01:57:51.204 --> 01:57:53.705]  That's all that is, like they bomb Serbia and then come in and take it over.
[01:57:55.666 --> 01:58:00.507]  The Muslims aren't going to get you, and the radical ones in every case are CIA controlled.
[01:58:07.062 --> 01:58:10.985]  Patrick Henry taught us our Constitution is an instrument for its people to restrain the government.
[01:58:11.325 --> 01:58:24.213]  Yet our Congress and President stampede the founding document, overlook its explicitness and mandate, manipulate its words to abandon a balance of power and accommodate their own desires, partisan politics and runaway spending.
[01:58:24.253 --> 01:58:31.758]  John Adams declared that our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people, yet we bastardize the First Amendment.
[01:58:31.778 --> 01:58:33.519]  It goes on to talk about
[01:58:34.696 --> 01:58:35.197]  Muslims.
[01:58:35.578 --> 01:58:37.723]  He mixes in our Bill of Rights and Constitution is under attack.
[01:58:38.164 --> 01:58:39.647]  Declaration of Independence is under attack.
[01:58:39.687 --> 01:58:40.529]  It's all under attack.
[01:58:40.950 --> 01:58:42.293]  But the Muslims are going to get it.
[01:58:42.433 --> 01:58:43.616]  It's a bait and switch.
[01:58:43.636 --> 01:58:45.179]  I told you that's what I saw.
[01:58:52.270 --> 01:58:53.230]  And it goes on here.
[01:58:54.371 --> 01:58:55.791]  He reads from the Declaration of Independence.
[01:58:55.811 --> 01:59:01.453]  When I appeared on Glenn Beck's radio show, he told me that someone had asked him, do you really believe there's going to be trouble in the future?
[01:59:01.593 --> 01:59:16.918]  And he answered, if this country starts to spiral out of control and Mexico melts down or whatever, it really starts to spiral out of control before America allows a country to become a totalitarian country, which it would have under, I think, Republicans as well in this situation.
[01:59:16.958 --> 01:59:17.859]  So he's being good there.
[01:59:19.229 --> 01:59:21.691]  They were taking us to the same place, just slower.
[01:59:21.751 --> 01:59:22.531]  No, just as fast.
[01:59:22.911 --> 01:59:24.012]  Americans won't stand for it.
[01:59:24.032 --> 01:59:25.633]  There will be parts of the country that will rise up.
[01:59:26.173 --> 01:59:31.396]  Then Glenn Beck asked me and his listening audience, and where's this going to come from?
[01:59:31.416 --> 01:59:33.658]  He answered his own question.
[01:59:33.698 --> 01:59:34.078]  Texas.
[01:59:34.118 --> 01:59:35.039]  It's going to come from Texas.
[01:59:35.059 --> 01:59:36.179]  See, they're worried about us, folks.
[01:59:36.459 --> 01:59:37.120]  They're worried about Austin.
[01:59:37.140 --> 01:59:37.920]  They're worried about me.
[01:59:38.781 --> 01:59:40.142]  Do you agree with that, Chuck?
[01:59:40.602 --> 01:59:42.103]  I replied, oh yeah, definitely.
[01:59:44.761 --> 01:59:50.567]  It was these types of thoughts that led me to utter the tongue-in-cheek frustration on Glenn Beck's radio show, I May Run for President of Texas.
[01:59:52.349 --> 01:59:56.012]  I'm not saying the other states won't muster the gumption to stand to succeed.
[01:59:56.032 --> 01:59:58.575]  So he is doing something good here, saying the states need to stand up.
[01:59:58.875 --> 02:00:03.320]  It's just with Beck in the middle of it and a clear intelligence operative, this thing is screwed from the get-go.
[02:00:04.758 --> 02:00:08.521]  Texas was its own country before it joined the Union in its 28th state.
[02:00:08.781 --> 02:00:13.344]  From 1836 to 1846, Texas won, was its own republic.
[02:00:13.404 --> 02:00:16.247]  Washington on the Brazos River served as our Philadelphia.
[02:00:16.687 --> 02:00:21.911]  It was there on March 2nd, 1836, where a band of patriots forged the Texas Declaration of Independence.
[02:00:22.892 --> 02:00:25.573]  We just celebrated this date last week.
[02:00:26.604 --> 02:00:27.425]  Yeah, Alamo Day.
[02:00:28.185 --> 02:00:39.335]  On March 1st, 1845, then President John Tyler signed a congressional bill annexing the Republic of Texas through the annex and resolution never explicitly granted Texas the right to secede from the Union as is often reported.
[02:00:39.375 --> 02:00:42.498]  Many, including me, hold that it is implies by unique
[02:00:43.698 --> 02:00:48.861]  Well, all the states, read the 9th and 10th Amendment, they created the government, they can pull out any time.
[02:00:49.361 --> 02:01:03.408]  As well as the unusual provision in the resolution that gave Texas the right to divide into as many as five states, both the original 1836 and the current 1876 Texas Constitution also declare that all political power is inherent in the people, that they all
[02:01:04.525 --> 02:01:10.567]  At all times, an inalienable right to alter their government in such a manner as they might think proper.
[02:01:10.607 --> 02:01:17.069]  Well yeah, it's like the right to revolt, Article 10 of the New Hampshire Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[02:01:18.910 --> 02:01:26.012]  And he goes on to say anyone who's been around Texas for any length of time knows exactly what we do if the going got rough in America.
[02:01:28.413 --> 02:01:33.115]  But there be no doubt about that, as Sam Houston once said, Texas is yet to learn submission to any oppression
[02:01:34.741 --> 02:01:36.282]  Come from what any source it may.
[02:01:40.886 --> 02:01:52.616]  For those losing hope and others wanting to rekindle the patriotic fires of early America, I encourage you to join Fox News, Glenn Beck, me, and millions of people across the country saying anybody that watches is in the cell.
[02:01:53.877 --> 02:02:00.463]  In the live telecast, we surround them on Friday afternoon, Eastern Time.
[02:02:00.503 --> 02:02:01.523]  That's coming up in about 30 minutes.
[02:02:03.339 --> 02:02:04.479]  We gotta watch this.
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:12.481]  Thousands of cell groups will be united around the country in solidarity over the concerns of our nation.
[02:02:13.261 --> 02:02:16.442]  You can host or attend a viewing party by going to Glenn's website.
[02:02:16.542 --> 02:02:18.342]  God, Glenn is really trying to take over.
[02:02:19.182 --> 02:02:26.544]  My wife Gina and I will be hosting one from our Texas ranch in which we've invited many family members and friends and law enforcement to join us.
[02:02:27.684 --> 02:02:32.225]  It's our way of saying we're united and we're tired of corruption and we're not going to take it anymore.
[02:02:32.975 --> 02:02:34.797]  I have to reserve judgment on all this.
[02:02:34.857 --> 02:02:38.760]  I just have to say Glenn Beck's a snake and is engaged in betrayal after betrayal.
[02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:40.361]  That's why I blasted him last week.
[02:02:40.901 --> 02:02:44.304]  Again, Sam Houston put it well when he gave the marching orders.
[02:02:44.424 --> 02:02:46.166]  We view ourselves on the eve of battle.
[02:02:46.666 --> 02:02:47.106]  We are...
[02:02:48.127 --> 02:02:50.629]  Nerved for the contest and must conquer or perish.
[02:02:51.009 --> 02:02:52.770]  It is vain to look for present aid.
[02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:53.570]  None is at hand.
[02:02:53.911 --> 02:02:55.912]  We must now act or abandon all hope.
[02:02:56.052 --> 02:02:56.572]  That's true.
[02:02:57.152 --> 02:03:01.155]  Rally to the standard and be no longer the scoff of mercenary tongues.
[02:03:01.675 --> 02:03:02.175]  Be men.
[02:03:02.276 --> 02:03:02.956]  Be free men.
[02:03:03.516 --> 02:03:05.678]  Your children may bless their father's name.
[02:03:06.238 --> 02:03:08.079]  That your children may bless their father's name.
[02:03:13.882 --> 02:03:13.962]  Um...
[02:03:17.372 --> 02:03:21.695]  I mean, this is unprecedented, and I guarantee you, Beck has co-opted this.
[02:03:22.435 --> 02:03:24.437]  I know some of the police that are friends with him.
[02:03:24.457 --> 02:03:27.599]  That's when they told me he was a fan 10 years ago, and then I got contacted.
[02:03:27.619 --> 02:03:35.884]  But he didn't want to come on air at that time, and I just left him alone until we got contacted by the publisher, sent us a book, and they said, Chuck wants to come on the show.
[02:03:35.904 --> 02:03:38.406]  And then he came on and was kind of timid, but said, yeah, I know things are bad.
[02:03:38.426 --> 02:03:41.908]  And then off air, in the four-minute break, when we said bye to him, you guys were witnesses.
[02:03:41.928 --> 02:03:42.889]  Remember?
[02:03:42.909 --> 02:03:44.530]  Remember the Chuck Norris conversation?
[02:03:47.208 --> 02:03:48.589]  And he said, oh no, I've been listening to you.
[02:03:48.629 --> 02:03:49.290]  I know it's true.
[02:03:49.310 --> 02:03:50.991]  I just don't know how I'm going to go public.
[02:03:51.071 --> 02:03:51.532]  Oh, I know.
[02:03:51.572 --> 02:03:52.893]  And I said, you know about all this stuff.
[02:03:53.353 --> 02:03:54.854]  And he goes, well, there's people working on it.
[02:03:54.894 --> 02:03:55.755]  We're going to look.
[02:03:55.815 --> 02:03:58.457]  He's got all these spooks around him and all this stuff.
[02:03:58.497 --> 02:04:03.781]  And it's I'm not even obsessed with with, you know, Chuck Norris, you know, and all the jokes they make about him.
[02:04:03.861 --> 02:04:06.924]  Chuck Norris is the wet and water, you know, all those little
[02:04:08.314 --> 02:04:09.516]  All those little jokes they tell.
[02:04:10.857 --> 02:04:16.164]  Things like, when the boogeyman goes to sleep at every night, he checks under his closet for Chuck Norris.
[02:04:16.205 --> 02:04:17.346]  Chuck Norris doesn't read books.
[02:04:17.406 --> 02:04:20.150]  He stares them down until he gets the information he wants.
[02:04:20.530 --> 02:04:23.534]  Outer space exists, but it's afraid to be on the same planet with Chuck Norris.
[02:04:25.089 --> 02:04:30.691]  It's that Chuck Norris, if he was to call for some type of insurrection, it would happen.
[02:04:31.171 --> 02:04:33.912]  And that's what the military wants and what is going on.
[02:04:34.372 --> 02:04:37.053]  But I don't think it'll be a call to action militarily.
[02:04:37.113 --> 02:04:43.996]  It's just going to be forming some new right-wing thing around the Republicans to then, you know, go after Russia and the Muslims.
[02:04:45.636 --> 02:04:47.457]  I noticed this like six, seven years ago from
[02:04:50.649 --> 02:04:59.537]  Michael Wiener Savage, the beatnik poet of the 60s, top beatnik, now conservative, as he would say, we gotta fight the New World Order, the Muslims of the New World Order, they want global government.
[02:05:00.097 --> 02:05:03.560]  And sure, I mean, I guess some of them do want their own jihad world government, but they don't have the power there.
[02:05:03.580 --> 02:05:08.064]  I mean, the point is, that's not what the banks are, and who's stealing from us, and who's ruling us.
[02:05:08.084 --> 02:05:15.371]  And he would go, gotta fight the International Crime Syndicate or the Muslims, and then they're with the New World Order, and the Democrats work with the Muslims in the New World Order.
[02:05:15.931 --> 02:05:19.612]  And then I watch Beckham and it's like, yeah, the FEMA camps are being built and it's really bad.
[02:05:19.672 --> 02:05:21.673]  And it's the Russians.
[02:05:21.693 --> 02:05:22.993]  The Russians are about to nuke us.
[02:05:24.153 --> 02:05:25.354]  He mixes it all together.
[02:05:25.374 --> 02:05:27.034]  Is everybody concerned with the truth?
[02:05:27.054 --> 02:05:29.155]  Because it's all rising right now.
[02:05:29.175 --> 02:05:31.135]  I told you this is big, folks.
[02:05:31.716 --> 02:05:32.376]  It's huge.
[02:05:32.436 --> 02:05:33.416]  We're winning.
[02:05:34.136 --> 02:05:35.837]  But we knew crap like this would get pulled.
[02:05:35.877 --> 02:05:40.158]  But that insincere, fake little demonic weasel, Glenn Beck,
[02:05:43.314 --> 02:05:46.696]  God help us, we're in for one amazing ride here.
[02:05:49.078 --> 02:05:50.339]  Well, this thing's about to start.
[02:05:50.519 --> 02:05:52.180]  I gotta go send an email to Chuck Norris.
[02:05:52.461 --> 02:06:01.307]  I need to stay more in contact with people like this and I'll probably be on Burmese's show tonight covering this.
[02:06:01.327 --> 02:06:05.170]  Let me check my interview times.
[02:06:08.852 --> 02:06:12.735]  I don't understand why it doesn't have the other interview on here.
[02:06:15.267 --> 02:06:16.670]  There's nothing I can do about it, it doesn't matter.
[02:06:19.895 --> 02:06:21.235]  I'll continue to try to track this.
[02:06:21.335 --> 02:06:25.837]  We'll get a blurb out about this or something at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:06:26.377 --> 02:06:32.839]  Notice, again, we need to have the viral movement on the Obama deception, which exposes Bush and Obama as puppets of the bankers.
[02:06:32.939 --> 02:06:33.900]  They're the New World Order.
[02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:40.202]  Keep getting the Obama deception out on all of the Cedars, all of the BitTorrents, everything.
[02:06:40.242 --> 02:06:41.822]  It's all over the web for free, folks.
[02:06:42.703 --> 02:06:48.024]  And the problem is people were so greedy to get it up quickly that they would do low-res uploads to YouTube.
[02:06:48.044 --> 02:06:48.965]  It looks like total crap.
[02:06:49.665 --> 02:06:51.667]  And we're trying to find a free one to link to that looks good.
[02:06:51.687 --> 02:06:52.308]  We haven't found them.
[02:06:52.528 --> 02:06:56.992]  Looks so good on the DivX and all the other copies we have at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:57.232 --> 02:06:58.073]  $5.95 that funds us.
[02:06:58.113 --> 02:06:59.535]  Go sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:07:00.035 --> 02:07:00.796]  Make copies of it.
[02:07:00.816 --> 02:07:01.497]  Burn it to disk.
[02:07:01.977 --> 02:07:03.038]  Get it out to everybody you know.
[02:07:03.078 --> 02:07:04.379]  This has got to go supernova.
[02:07:06.501 --> 02:07:08.643]  You're talking about revolution exploding any day now?
[02:07:09.483 --> 02:07:10.184]  We don't want that.
[02:07:10.204 --> 02:07:18.270]  We want to keep building and waking people up so it can be peaceful or when the enemy strikes and goes ahead and starts the hot war, so many troops and military are awake, this doesn't happen.
[02:07:18.570 --> 02:07:24.195]  And this may be positive, this may wake up the police and military, they'll just think Glenn Beck is their leader and is going to save them.
[02:07:25.136 --> 02:07:26.397]  See how sophisticated that is?
[02:07:27.217 --> 02:07:30.900]  This is a sigh up, folks, and I don't know if Chuck Norris is involved in it, but I'm going to ask him.
[02:07:32.081 --> 02:07:32.982]  I'm going to ask him right now.
[02:07:34.284 --> 02:07:39.329]  Alright, we'll go back into the retransmission at InfoWars.com until 9 to midnight this evening.
[02:07:40.690 --> 02:07:42.852]  I know a lot of listeners know Chuck Norris.
[02:07:42.872 --> 02:07:43.933]  Police officers are friends with him.
[02:07:43.953 --> 02:07:46.054]  You're probably at his house right now or driving up to it.
[02:07:46.575 --> 02:07:57.725]  Call us here at the office 512-291-5787 or 512-291-5750 and get us in touch with Chuck because I didn't ask him for his number for some reason when he gave me his cell phone.
[02:07:57.745 --> 02:07:58.726]  I don't push these guys.
