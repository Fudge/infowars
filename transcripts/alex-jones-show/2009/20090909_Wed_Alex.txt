[00:00:01.337 --> 00:00:06.398]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:06.738 --> 00:00:09.078]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:18.160]  Well, the eighth anniversary of the tragic staged terror attacks of 9-11 is approaching.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.221]  The eighth anniversary, I would just remind people that we were called conspiracy theorists just three years ago for saying the Gulf of Tonkin was staged.
[00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:28.362]  It's now declassified that those were staged attacks on our ships.
[00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:29.642]  To blame it,
[00:00:30.522 --> 00:00:36.969]  Uh, on the Vietnamese to start the Vietnam War that killed over a million and a half Vietnamese and over 58,000 Americans, injuring over 200,000 Americans.
[00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:45.418]  I just want to point out Operation Ajax, staged terror attacks that were blamed on the government of Iran, is declassified at the CIA's own history section.
[00:00:46.772 --> 00:00:52.857]  I just want to point out that it's now been declassified by the NSA that the USS Liberty attack was staged to be blamed on Egypt.
[00:00:53.698 --> 00:00:59.922]  That came out years after many people exposed it, long before I was on the scene it was exposed, 20-something, 30 years ago.
[00:01:00.263 --> 00:01:02.545]  Well, that happened in 67, but it was exposed from day one.
[00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:03.946]  That's now come out.
[00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:07.489]  Operation Northwoods has been declassified.
[00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:07.789]  The U.S.
[00:01:07.809 --> 00:01:08.870]  government planned to bomb U.S.
[00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.992]  cities and crash jets and blame it on foreign enemies.
[00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:13.834]  That's been declassified.
[00:01:15.032 --> 00:01:20.256]  And Army Field Manual from 2004 has been declassified where it talks about how to stage false flag terror attacks.
[00:01:21.758 --> 00:01:29.784]  It's come out that six of the ten 9-11 Commission members even told the Washington Post that the 9-11 Commission was a fraud and a lie and a cover-up and needed to be criminally investigated.
[00:01:29.844 --> 00:01:33.247]  It's even been in the news but never gets any traction, never becomes a big issue.
[00:01:34.668 --> 00:01:37.891]  We can't just sit here idly by and let all this continue.
[00:01:38.942 --> 00:01:42.664]  So my point is, you're crazy to not know about the history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:01:42.964 --> 00:01:55.109]  You're crazy to not know about all the cases out there where Hitler firebombed his own Reichstag on February 27th to get police state going in Germany.
[00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.190]  Or how Stalin staged terror attacks.
[00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.291]  Or how the Tsarist, one of their favorite tactics was to stage terror attacks and blame it on their enemies.
[00:02:01.732 --> 00:02:06.594]  Or how British intelligence has now been declassified and caught staging many of the IRA bombings.
[00:02:06.654 --> 00:02:07.234]  Some were real.
[00:02:08.715 --> 00:02:13.882]  Or, Haaretz and Jerusalem Post admit that, quote, Israel headline created fake Al-Qaeda groups.
[00:02:13.902 --> 00:02:16.486]  Every time there was about to be a peace deal.
[00:02:16.706 --> 00:02:19.570]  There is, of course, real terrorism in Israel going on, and it's terrible.
[00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.057]  But the point is, Israeli papers admit the government's been caught staging it at key points.
[00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.271]  That's what we're talking about here.
[00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:28.892]  And then you look at the science.
[00:02:29.052 --> 00:02:38.599]  The establishment likes to do these hit pieces on the science because they know the general public aren't architects or engineers or physicists or underwriting laboratories people like Kevin Ryan.
[00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:42.881]  They can shoot a missile into a chicken coop and say it would have blown the Pentagon up.
[00:02:43.482 --> 00:02:47.925]  They can show you a three-story building and say if we would have blown it up we would have found debt court.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:03:00.046]  I mean, they can do so many little things, little gimmicks, or say we're crazy and just want to believe this, when the history that we have is a continual chain of staged terror attacks.
[00:03:01.126 --> 00:03:07.029]  Now, on the Charlie Sheen issue, and we're going to Richard Gage, this is less than 24 hours after the media picked this up.
[00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.750]  They picked it up first in the afternoon yesterday.
[00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.092]  At about 4 o'clock, we saw the first mainstream news stories.
[00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:16.394]  Now, 20 hours into this, or 21 hours into this,
[00:03:17.423 --> 00:03:18.104]  Fox News.
[00:03:18.424 --> 00:03:22.026]  Charlie Sheen seeks meeting with Obama to discuss 9-1-1 cover-up.
[00:03:25.368 --> 00:03:26.389]  Look at this story out of E!
[00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.950]  Entertainment.
[00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.630]  Front page.
[00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.732]  Charlie Sheen, the truther, teaches Obama about 9-11.
[00:03:33.014 --> 00:03:33.234]  U.S.
[00:03:33.274 --> 00:03:34.154]  News & World Report.
[00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:36.976]  Charlie Sheen joins the truther, 9-1-1 conspiracy theory fringe.
[00:03:36.996 --> 00:03:37.557]  Fact piece.
[00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:38.357]  L.A.
[00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:38.878]  Times.
[00:03:39.338 --> 00:03:40.459]  Top of the ticket section.
[00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:41.479]  Top political news.
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.180]  Breaking.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.102]  Charlie Sheen demands Obama meeting on 9-1-1 cover-up.
[00:03:48.462 --> 00:03:49.062]  Here's another one.
[00:03:49.082 --> 00:03:52.124]  Charlie Sheen, Fantasy 9-1-1 Truth, or Grilling of the President.
[00:03:52.484 --> 00:03:52.884]  Gawker.
[00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:57.126]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:03:57.486 --> 00:04:00.227]  President Obama, Charlie Sheen, Van Jones, the 9-1-1 Truth Movement.
[00:04:01.688 --> 00:04:03.229]  This is out of Associated Content.
[00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.650]  And it goes on and on.
[00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:07.711]  Here's one.
[00:04:07.731 --> 00:04:10.252]  I mean, there's just so many of these.
[00:04:10.272 --> 00:04:11.853]  The Houston Chronicle.
[00:04:15.322 --> 00:04:17.803]  It's just, there's just too many to cover them all.
[00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:18.743]  Very, very exciting.
[00:04:19.083 --> 00:04:27.186]  That's why Charlie wrote the letter about a meeting with the President, so that it would become a big issue of him wanting to actually meet with the President.
[00:04:27.226 --> 00:04:31.108]  That's what he talked about earlier when he was live on the show, in the tape interview we just aired.
[00:04:31.488 --> 00:04:33.929]  That's the whole point of what we're doing.
[00:04:34.884 --> 00:04:35.304]  Okay?
[00:04:35.944 --> 00:04:39.005]  Is to get people to look at those 20 points in the 20 questions for the President.
[00:04:39.366 --> 00:04:40.646]  And it was all Charlie's idea.
[00:04:41.226 --> 00:04:44.027]  Every bit of it was done exactly the way he wanted.
[00:04:44.768 --> 00:04:46.648]  And it was a genius idea.
[00:04:46.788 --> 00:04:47.829]  Even a brilliant idea.
[00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:51.630]  Even people criticizing him and don't agree with 9-11 Truth are saying it was very well written.
[00:04:54.591 --> 00:04:56.091]  So, it's very exciting.
[00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:57.032]  Let's go to Richard Gage.
[00:04:57.092 --> 00:04:59.013]  Richard, I appreciate you coming on.
[00:04:59.993 --> 00:05:01.733]  First off, the Charlie's scene situation.
[00:05:02.174 --> 00:05:03.034]  What's your take on it?
[00:05:03.814 --> 00:05:13.503]  Yeah, but we need people in the entertainment world, in Hollywood, talking about 9-11 truth.
[00:05:13.683 --> 00:05:16.686]  And Charlie began this, what, four years ago?
[00:05:16.806 --> 00:05:17.527]  Five years ago?
[00:05:17.547 --> 00:05:18.328]  Three and a half, yeah.
[00:05:19.124 --> 00:05:19.724]  Three and a half.
[00:05:19.764 --> 00:05:26.208]  He took so much heat for this that he had to back off until there was more support at a grassroots level.
[00:05:26.268 --> 00:05:27.369]  And we've got that now.
[00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:36.014]  We've got 830 architects and engineers backing him up, saying, yes, these buildings came down by explosive-controlled demolition.
[00:05:36.055 --> 00:05:39.897]  So with all of this support and others, of course, across the 9-11 Truth Movement,
[00:05:40.357 --> 00:05:54.964]  Supporting him, he can come out and make a splash now, and maybe it's time, Alex, and you've really supported him and given him a vehicle for this expression of coming out of the closet again and building truth.
[00:05:55.044 --> 00:05:56.264]  This is what has to happen.
[00:05:56.665 --> 00:06:05.809]  And it has to happen with Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura and others who have kind of squeaked a little bit here and there, but now it's time, isn't it?
[00:06:07.827 --> 00:06:09.488]  Well it certainly is, my friend.
[00:06:10.448 --> 00:06:14.651]  So much is going on, so much is happening right now.
[00:06:15.611 --> 00:06:22.154]  Let's get into, there's several new hit pieces for Discovery Channel and History Channel and A&E that are being made.
[00:06:22.234 --> 00:06:24.456]  PBS is making another hit piece the British have made.
[00:06:25.577 --> 00:06:27.600]  Six in the last year and a half that I know of.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.022]  Just absolutely ridiculous.
[00:06:30.083 --> 00:06:31.806]  All of that is going on and happening.
[00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:37.114]  And then at the same time, we have this latest big budget.
[00:06:37.474 --> 00:06:40.920]  And I was reading it was funded by Dubai, our foreign country.
[00:06:42.458 --> 00:06:46.483]  With this really shoddy hour-long special that spends a half of it on our psychology.
[00:06:47.063 --> 00:06:49.546]  And they played all sorts of little tricks with the camera.
[00:06:50.067 --> 00:06:51.408]  All sorts of things they did.
[00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:53.410]  The way they always made it your opinion.
[00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:55.873]  We talked Sunday, but I want you to recap and expand on that.
[00:06:56.394 --> 00:07:00.238]  How you gave them all the evidence, all the facts, and they would never allow that to be shown in the show.
[00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:01.420]  I mean, really!
[00:07:02.907 --> 00:07:03.547]  Outrageous.
[00:07:03.587 --> 00:07:04.968]  But I think it's backfiring on them.
[00:07:04.988 --> 00:07:11.731]  And it was made by a famous production house that specializes just in hit pieces and quote, debunking conspiracy theorists.
[00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:17.893]  I mean, they do piece after piece creative differences who I've refused to be interviewed by at a JFK piece in 9-11.
[00:07:18.193 --> 00:07:19.594]  So break it down for us.
[00:07:20.154 --> 00:07:28.577]  As an architect, as an engineer who's built major structures, who has 800 architects and engineers and thousands of other students who are becoming engineers and architects on your team, but 800 plus
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.662]  Well, we've been speaking all across the country now for three years.
[00:07:40.782 --> 00:07:46.084]  We've had over 110 presentations to thousands and thousands of people.
[00:07:46.524 --> 00:07:58.009]  We've toured Europe with nine cities in Europe, and next month we're going to Japan, Australia, and New Zealand for November.
[00:08:00.285 --> 00:08:10.911]  The key senator, Senator Yukihisa Fujita, whose party just won, took over their government basically.
[00:08:11.711 --> 00:08:12.892]  It was a minority party.
[00:08:14.993 --> 00:08:18.014]  This party is transforming Japan right now.
[00:08:18.094 --> 00:08:19.475]  It's kind of like the revolution we had
[00:08:20.035 --> 00:08:21.416]  And let me just throw a caveat in.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:09:00.800]  Um, as of a year ago when he first went public and we interviewed him here as well and he's since traveled to New York and other major cities of the world, he was the number three person in his party in the diet.
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.702]  Now his party.
[00:09:03.749 --> 00:09:20.239]  for after decades and decades out of power is now in power and as you said the president of his party is now the president of the country so we need to go look at the power structure but I believe he's number two now in the Japanese government is a 9-11 truther who shows
[00:09:20.979 --> 00:09:28.424]  Clips and clips of your films and clips of Professor Stephen Jones repeatedly in the Diet, in their Congress.
[00:09:28.524 --> 00:09:30.466]  I mean, this is all over Japanese TV.
[00:09:30.486 --> 00:09:32.367]  They came and interviewed me many times.
[00:09:33.308 --> 00:09:34.689]  But I mean, this is incredible!
[00:09:38.079 --> 00:09:42.662]  I'm excited about it too, and we get to go there and be right in the middle of it and learn a whole lot more about it.
[00:09:42.863 --> 00:09:51.149]  In fact, they're booking the Diet itself, the governmental body, the building, we're going to be speaking there.
[00:09:51.249 --> 00:09:53.431]  That's the plan at this point.
[00:09:53.792 --> 00:10:00.097]  Not to their government, but having the public come to that place.
[00:10:00.817 --> 00:10:01.638]  Unbelievable.
[00:10:01.658 --> 00:10:06.262]  So that would be like having a huge 9-11 truth investigation in the House or in the Senate.
[00:10:06.715 --> 00:10:06.995]  Yeah!
[00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:07.975]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:08.436 --> 00:10:10.176]  I mean, that's pretty exciting.
[00:10:10.456 --> 00:10:14.517]  So we'll try to put something very special together for that.
[00:10:15.738 --> 00:10:25.021]  Last night, I had the opportunity to speak to a packed house of 200 at the Commonwealth Club of California.
[00:10:25.081 --> 00:10:26.481]  We webcast this live.
[00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:27.982]  We had 435 people listening live also from home.
[00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:55.727]  on their computers, and I had 40 minutes to present all of the evidence, which, by the way, I very carefully laid out before Robert Erickson of Creative Differences, who was the producer for this National Geographic entertainment piece, we call it, that many people have had the opportunity to see.
[00:10:56.447 --> 00:11:01.930]  And we'll be talking about how they go about distorting what we have to say.
[00:11:02.591 --> 00:11:23.063]  But it's very important that people understand that I spent an hour with him highlighting the evidence of the free-fall acceleration of World Trade Center 7 in the pools of molten iron that are found underneath it in the Twin Towers.
[00:11:23.792 --> 00:11:42.049]  And all of this evidence, the massive expulsion of perimeter wall sections, 600 feet at 70 miles an hour, instant acceleration out of the side of the Twin Towers, no floors found at the bottom of the Twin Towers, pulverized concrete, 90,000 tons of it.
[00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.632]  Richard, we've got a break here in about 15 seconds.
[00:11:44.672 --> 00:11:45.152]  Stay there.
[00:11:45.172 --> 00:11:45.913]  We're going to come back.
[00:11:45.933 --> 00:11:48.516]  Because you talked about this Sunday, but a lot of people didn't hear it.
[00:11:53.903 --> 00:12:06.110]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:11.293]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[00:12:11.794 --> 00:12:12.334]  That was then.
[00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.630]  This is now.
[00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:16.512]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[00:12:17.013 --> 00:12:22.656]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time audio and video.
[00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:31.902]  The DigiNet Sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, unlawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings, proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[00:12:32.282 --> 00:12:35.044]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[00:12:35.744 --> 00:12:39.707]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[00:12:40.227 --> 00:12:41.248]  Video never lies.

[00:12:52.935 --> 00:12:53.135]  1-888-344-6681 today.
[00:13:00.816 --> 00:13:07.199]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:13:07.559 --> 00:13:09.540]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.241]  But who is the enemy?
[00:13:11.761 --> 00:13:12.261]  Bin Laden.
[00:13:12.561 --> 00:13:13.482]  This is his ammo.
[00:13:13.522 --> 00:13:14.902]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:13:14.922 --> 00:13:16.563]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:13:16.943 --> 00:13:23.666]  Enabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:13:24.066 --> 00:13:24.506]  Some U.S.
[00:13:24.546 --> 00:13:30.189]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:34.371]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:13:34.391 --> 00:13:36.553]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:14:01.058 --> 00:14:04.722]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:14:05.123 --> 00:14:10.549]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.091]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:14:12.131 --> 00:14:16.176]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:14:16.816 --> 00:14:30.147]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:14:30.627 --> 00:14:35.952]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:14:36.252 --> 00:14:42.137]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:14:42.877 --> 00:14:44.078]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:44.138 --> 00:14:45.839]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:14:45.859 --> 00:14:46.199]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:48.300]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:48.380]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:15:01.716 --> 00:15:11.061]  Are you suffering from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeats, clogged arteries?
[00:15:11.622 --> 00:15:13.283]  If so, you are not alone.
[00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:16.865]  Millions of people are suffering from one or more of these problems.
[00:15:17.265 --> 00:15:30.496]  If you'd like to live your life free of sickness, pain, and fear, live your life with increased vitality, energy, and youthfulness, and experience your body healing itself, then this might be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:15:30.776 --> 00:15:35.280]  An effective 100% organic nutritional supplement is now available.
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.360]  Well, you asked for it!
[00:16:05.316 --> 00:16:06.597]  They came and took it all away.
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:20.468]  Look at all these articles for people watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:16:20.668 --> 00:16:21.409]  LA Times.
[00:16:24.251 --> 00:16:25.032]  Fox News.
[00:16:26.713 --> 00:16:27.234]  Reuters.
[00:16:30.697 --> 00:16:31.537]  Houston Chronicle.
[00:16:32.731 --> 00:16:35.993]  Breaking, Charlie Sheen demands Obama meeting on 9-1-1 cover-up.
[00:16:37.834 --> 00:16:40.915]  Again, if he just came out for 9-1-1 Truth again, there wouldn't be as much attention.
[00:16:40.935 --> 00:16:44.838]  But if he comes out and wants to talk to Obama, it ignites massive debate.
[00:16:44.878 --> 00:16:49.040]  That was his idea, and it's much bigger than the last time he went public.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.141]  24 hours into this, it is just exploding.
[00:16:52.722 --> 00:16:53.502]  Very, very exciting.
[00:16:53.542 --> 00:17:00.246]  Going back to Richard Gage, because I have this article here, Richard, I want to get back into the science, and this guy promising he'd put
[00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:02.791]  No, I'm not aware of that Alex.
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.001]  We're going to cover that later.
[00:17:24.021 --> 00:17:25.102]  We'll continue.
[00:17:25.142 --> 00:17:26.063]  So recap.
[00:17:27.325 --> 00:17:32.911]  Creative Differences, the production company that did the piece for National Geographic TV, the hit piece.
[00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.833]  First they said it wasn't a hit piece, it was going to be fair.
[00:17:35.114 --> 00:17:36.355]  They promised they'd show your science.
[00:17:36.475 --> 00:17:36.876]  Continue.
[00:17:37.674 --> 00:17:55.459]  Well, yeah, they brought us down for the first interview, and I just mentioned before the break that we carefully laid out all of this information for them, and they're asking very intelligent questions, and they're nodding, and he was aware that we were telling the truth, and he was very impressed by it.
[00:17:55.599 --> 00:17:56.500]  I have to tell you that.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.160]  This guy knows what's going on.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.042]  This is not some kind of unconscious skepticism or something.
[00:18:05.183 --> 00:18:06.264]  We're good to go.
[00:18:21.602 --> 00:18:25.024]  Their interviews were taken out of context, and so forth.
[00:18:25.364 --> 00:18:36.628]  So he brings us back, and actually, I'm watching myself in the rough cut with all this evidence, and I'm delighted, because, you know, we're talking about molten metal.
[00:18:36.829 --> 00:18:40.910]  We're talking about nanothermite chips found in the dust.
[00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:44.112]  Very high-tech stuff, not made in a cave in Afghanistan.
[00:18:44.132 --> 00:18:49.334]  I think your next hour's guest, Steve Jones, will be talking in detail about that.
[00:18:50.086 --> 00:19:01.078]  But I told him about the small, previously molten iron spheres the size of a human hair that are found in all the dust samples ignited thermite by chemical analysis.
[00:19:01.198 --> 00:19:03.040]  Anyway, all of this was in there.
[00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:06.731]  We're delighted, right?
[00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:11.393]  And then he brings out these experiments that he's done.
[00:19:11.413 --> 00:19:21.697]  Emertech, who's really nothing more than a defense contractor at New Mexico, because they're like Lawrence Livermore Lab or something.
[00:19:21.837 --> 00:19:23.718]  All of their money comes from defense.
[00:19:24.278 --> 00:19:25.439]  They're on the government payroll!
[00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:26.680]  That's for sure.
[00:19:27.181 --> 00:19:29.163]  And so they have these three experiments.
[00:19:29.283 --> 00:19:32.868]  They never talked to us about what experiments they might be doing.
[00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:37.414]  They didn't get our input at all.
[00:19:37.434 --> 00:19:39.177]  We're just watching these experiments.
[00:19:39.217 --> 00:19:42.962]  So they lure you back to see the rough cut and it's these experiments?
[00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:52.216]  Then we see the rough cut, and we're delighted with what we were shown of ourselves, and then these experiments come on, and we're going, what the heck is this?
[00:19:52.496 --> 00:19:56.679]  And by the way, they're videotaping your response.
[00:19:56.699 --> 00:19:57.740]  They're like, come see the rough cut.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.421]  Now come in here.
[00:19:58.681 --> 00:20:00.382]  We want to show you some other clips.
[00:20:00.402 --> 00:20:01.743]  I mean, is that how this happened?
[00:20:01.763 --> 00:20:03.164]  And then really they're videotaping you?
[00:20:03.564 --> 00:20:10.770]  Yes, and the intent was not that they were going to use our responses in the final version.
[00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:12.391]  The intent was that
[00:20:13.103 --> 00:20:13.744]  What did he say?
[00:20:15.305 --> 00:20:18.747]  We just want a record that you're happy with what you saw, basically.
[00:20:19.068 --> 00:20:21.009]  So this is a manipulation, clearly.
[00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:29.636]  And I have to tell you, this thermite experiment, for instance, where they put this 8-inch tall I-beam across 500 gallons of jet fuel and light it,
[00:20:39.212 --> 00:20:52.319]  But a 3,000-pound load in the middle of this I-beam, and we have in a couple of minutes temperatures rising very high and causing the failure of this beam.
[00:20:52.959 --> 00:20:55.540]  Well, first of all, how'd they talk to us?
[00:20:56.181 --> 00:21:04.385]  And even if they didn't talk to us, they should have known that NIST, in their investigation, hired Underwriter Laboratories to develop
[00:21:05.103 --> 00:21:12.470]  An exact replica of the floor truss system with a composite deck of concrete and metal decking.
[00:21:13.671 --> 00:21:20.516]  And they had under laboratory conditions, ASTM E-119 is the test number.
[00:21:20.797 --> 00:21:27.943]  They put 2,000 degrees of fire under the truss and twice the known amount of loading on top of the floor system.
[00:21:28.918 --> 00:21:29.398]  Stay there.
[00:21:29.478 --> 00:21:30.279]  This is scientific.
[00:21:30.319 --> 00:21:31.480]  I don't want to interrupt this.
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.881]  Yes, the underwriting laboratories found it wouldn't happen.
[00:21:34.241 --> 00:21:37.743]  But see, one of their members goes public, releasing their report.
[00:21:37.763 --> 00:21:38.363]  They fire him.
[00:21:38.724 --> 00:21:39.564]  That's Kevin Ryan.
[00:21:39.604 --> 00:21:40.064]  Stay there.
[00:21:40.084 --> 00:21:43.706]  We're going to come right back with architect and engineer Richard Gage.
[00:21:44.787 --> 00:21:46.488]  Just powerful information.
[00:21:46.548 --> 00:21:46.988]  Stay with us.
[00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.091]  We're on the march.
[00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:54.192]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:55.132 --> 00:21:57.814]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:05.716]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:22:05.836 --> 00:22:10.202]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:22:10.382 --> 00:22:12.225]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:22:12.645 --> 00:22:13.987]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:22:14.267 --> 00:22:15.309]  There is a solution.
[00:22:15.529 --> 00:22:23.555]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:23:00.814 --> 00:23:05.795]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:23:06.015 --> 00:23:09.817]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:23:10.037 --> 00:23:15.638]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:23:15.938 --> 00:23:20.800]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:21.500]  Number three,
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:27.364]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:23:28.205 --> 00:23:30.867]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:23:31.107 --> 00:23:34.530]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:23:35.631 --> 00:23:39.254]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:23:39.474 --> 00:23:44.978]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:02.831]  Thomas Jefferson once said,

[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:33.536]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
[00:25:37.884 --> 00:25:42.286]  Okay, Richard Gage, Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth's founder.
[00:25:43.787 --> 00:25:45.728]  We got broken up by a couple breaks there.
[00:25:46.309 --> 00:26:04.040]  Recap what happened with the production company, with the television piece that just aired last week on the National Geographic Channel, and then conclude in summary exactly what you're saying here, and then I have the question to ask.
[00:26:05.296 --> 00:26:05.977]  After you're done.
[00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:07.258]  Okay.
[00:26:08.139 --> 00:26:23.193]  So, we have missed hiring Underwriter Laboratories to create this mock section, and they tested it according to very scientific, well, time-honored tests, and it did not fail.
[00:26:23.313 --> 00:26:25.755]  They had three different versions of this thing.
[00:26:25.795 --> 00:26:27.317]  It sagged only three inches.
[00:26:27.397 --> 00:26:28.338]  It did not fail.
[00:26:29.093 --> 00:26:29.434]  I don't
[00:26:48.734 --> 00:27:07.579]  Instead of doing something scientific like this, we have National Geographic, Robert Erickson of Creative Differences, hiring Amertek, a defense contractor, to show everybody, theoretically, how this building obviously fell apart.
[00:27:07.879 --> 00:27:12.561]  Well, first of all, they don't have 8-inch I-beams in the building.
[00:27:12.901 --> 00:27:14.001]  They have floor trusses.
[00:27:14.981 --> 00:27:19.183]  Uh, which certainly doesn't relate to any of the massive core columns in the building.
[00:27:19.584 --> 00:27:24.506]  We didn't have 500 gallons of jet fuel sitting there underneath anything.
[00:27:24.526 --> 00:27:28.648]  90% of that jet fuel was expelled and exploded outside the building.
[00:27:28.668 --> 00:27:31.529]  The rest burned up, according to the official story, in just 10 minutes.
[00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:37.572]  So all the jet fuel did was ignite a normal office fire, whose temperatures don't get to be above 12 or 1400 degrees.
[00:27:39.354 --> 00:27:46.511]  And even then there's no evidence for temperatures over 500 or 600 degrees in the towers.
[00:27:47.122 --> 00:27:50.363]  So, this whole thing from start to finish is just ludicrous.
[00:27:50.403 --> 00:28:14.330]  And this, by the way, this I-beam is not interconnected with several other beams like in a normal office building where the heat is conducted away from the heat source throughout the columns and beams in the building, which is really the reason why we never have had a steel frame high-rise building collapse due to fire because of this incredible conduction ability and interconnectedness.
[00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:15.411]  It's a huge heat sink.
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:34.226]  This experiment and the other ones were set up to fail and manipulate the American people into thinking that this is science versus, obviously, these architects and engineers who are simply conspiracy theorists.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:45.502]  But last night at the Commonwealth Club, we carefully laid out all this evidence, and he said, OK, at the end, which side is conspiracy and which side is science?
[00:28:45.582 --> 00:28:46.663]  So we have a show of hands.
[00:28:47.143 --> 00:28:48.383]  Guess what?
[00:28:48.903 --> 00:29:01.586]  90% of the 60 people who were either believers of the official theory beforehand or who were unsure, 90% of those 60 people were convinced of the evidence for explosive control.
[00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:03.307]  OK, to be clear, you've got 200 people.
[00:29:04.947 --> 00:29:09.028]  At this meeting, I guess you asked before who believes the official story, who doesn't.
[00:29:09.068 --> 00:29:10.729]  You're saying that's how you know it was 60 people?
[00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:12.610]  That's right.
[00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:20.352]  Okay, so they raised their hands, 60 saying, I believe the official story that 19 guys coordinated from caves in Afghanistan did this.
[00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:21.552]  Okay, great.
[00:29:22.773 --> 00:29:29.455]  And then at the end of it, you're saying 90% of those 60 people now believe the engineering, now believed your information.
[00:29:30.225 --> 00:29:43.618]  Yes, and the numbers are 20 and 40, so that there's 20 people believing the official story before, 40 who were unsure, but 90% of those totaling 60 believed in the explosive control demolition theory afterward.
[00:29:43.658 --> 00:29:45.781]  And it's like that at every presentation, Alex.
[00:29:46.722 --> 00:29:45.781]  90%!
[00:29:46.822 --> 00:29:51.847]  And you get most of these presentations, correct me if I'm wrong, to architects and engineer groups.
[00:29:52.697 --> 00:29:54.358]  Well, not mostly.
[00:29:54.558 --> 00:29:59.342]  No, we do visit local architecture and engineering groups, and generally... Well, that's what I meant.
[00:29:59.382 --> 00:30:04.065]  You said you've made a whole mission out of... I mean, how many architects and engineer groups have you talked to?
[00:30:05.446 --> 00:30:07.407]  There's been about a dozen now.
[00:30:07.907 --> 00:30:10.169]  Okay, well, what happens when you go to those?
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:27.874]  Oh, it's fascinating, because you get people who, first of all, most of them know nothing about the third worst structural failure in modern history, building seven 47-story skyscraper collapses to its own footprint in six and a half seconds, and their jaws drop.
[00:30:28.194 --> 00:30:36.157]  And by the way, NIST had always said freefall didn't happen, but then they were forced now to go ahead and say, okay, there was freefall involved.
[00:30:36.177 --> 00:30:43.299]  And they've given five, six different stories and had to recant their previous reasons that Building 7 collapsed in their own NIST reports.
[00:30:43.339 --> 00:30:44.180]  I'd like you to speak to that.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:50.902]  And even National Geographic on the eve of this newest hit piece said, oh, our last
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.064]  Reasons for the towers collapsing with Pancake.
[00:30:54.084 --> 00:30:56.428]  We were wrong about that, but now we've got a new idea.
[00:30:56.949 --> 00:31:01.777]  So they're the one, because they say in the piece their story's never changed, the government story's never changed.
[00:31:01.997 --> 00:31:03.900]  But in truth, their story continually changes.
[00:31:04.392 --> 00:31:05.312]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:31:05.492 --> 00:31:06.753]  It's always changing.
[00:31:07.233 --> 00:31:17.896]  In fact, they wouldn't have changed if it weren't for members of AEN11Truth, David Chandler, a physicist, and Stephen Jones calling them publicly on their press conference.
[00:31:18.436 --> 00:31:20.277]  And they had to.
[00:31:20.437 --> 00:31:21.697]  They were forced into a corner.
[00:31:22.077 --> 00:31:27.499]  Now they have to admit that the 100 feet of this building, its drop, was in free fall.
[00:31:27.839 --> 00:31:33.886]  That's crushing 40,000 tons of structural steel at the same rate that a brick is falling off the building.
[00:31:34.727 --> 00:31:35.888]  It can't happen.
[00:31:36.368 --> 00:31:37.410]  And everybody knows that.
[00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:39.732]  And every architect and engineer we talk to knows that.
[00:31:39.952 --> 00:31:43.196]  So they end up signing our petition saying, yeah, let's get a real investigation.
[00:31:43.638 --> 00:31:47.541]  Okay, I want to go back for a moment, and we'll continue going over this, debunking them.
[00:31:48.162 --> 00:32:02.634]  The maker of the television show, who I've talked to on the phone, he's always trying to get me involved in these shows, there's several shows, a JFK and a 9-11, and I tell this production company, no, I know you're deceptive, you're known as the most manipulative out there, that this is your specialty, and the guy laughs.
[00:32:02.734 --> 00:32:03.635]  I'm your friend!
[00:32:03.715 --> 00:32:05.617]  No, I want to show your side!
[00:32:05.677 --> 00:32:11.622]  And the JFK thing comes out, and it's a total fraud, the most skewed to the official story I've ever seen.
[00:32:12.575 --> 00:32:19.719]  And so that's why when I was warning you, I was saying, Richard, this is, you know, months ago, when you were doing the interviews, I said, this is not a friendly piece.
[00:32:19.759 --> 00:32:20.880]  You said, no, he's listening.
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:21.860]  He says it's going to be in there.
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:22.561]  He promises.
[00:32:23.161 --> 00:32:24.302]  Have you talked to him?
[00:32:24.902 --> 00:32:28.984]  Which you now say that, you know, that you clearly, that he lied to you.
[00:32:29.424 --> 00:32:32.226]  The question here is, are you going to put a public statement out on him?
[00:32:32.746 --> 00:32:34.527]  Are you going to, have you called him?
[00:32:34.587 --> 00:32:35.428]  Have you talked to him?
[00:32:37.821 --> 00:32:42.783]  Interestingly enough, he has sent us the transcript for both of these interviews.
[00:32:42.863 --> 00:32:50.766]  So it's clear that we have the evidence that he had all of the evidence.
[00:32:50.786 --> 00:32:51.707]  You need to post that.
[00:32:51.747 --> 00:32:52.767]  You need to post that.
[00:32:52.787 --> 00:32:55.248]  In fact, I'd post the whole transcript.
[00:32:55.488 --> 00:32:56.388]  He'll claim you edited it.
[00:32:56.908 --> 00:33:01.630]  I would post that and then let everybody write about it to show he's going, oh, I promised this would be in there.
[00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:03.631]  Oh, I mean, just unbelievable.
[00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:05.410]  Oh, totally.
[00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:07.312]  When are you going to put that out then?
[00:33:08.353 --> 00:33:09.534]  We'll get it out within a week.
[00:33:09.914 --> 00:33:10.555]  Good, good.
[00:33:10.595 --> 00:33:14.719]  Well, I'm going to be in New York for the whole next week, by the way.
[00:33:14.739 --> 00:33:16.020]  We'll be at Ground Zero.
[00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:18.983]  Hopefully, you'll be there in the morning.
[00:33:19.003 --> 00:33:19.904]  Unfortunately, I can't.
[00:33:19.944 --> 00:33:24.068]  I've got a bunch of stuff I'm working on here with the Charlie Sheen developments.
[00:33:24.528 --> 00:33:24.808]  Yeah.
[00:33:25.088 --> 00:33:26.529]  Well, I'll take your place, Alex.
[00:33:26.629 --> 00:33:29.171]  I'll be out there talking to people.
[00:33:29.191 --> 00:33:30.252]  There'll be a lot of cameras.
[00:33:30.272 --> 00:33:30.472]  Good, good.
[00:33:30.492 --> 00:33:31.593]  You're a great leader in this fight.
[00:33:32.073 --> 00:33:42.700]  Yeah, no, I'm finishing my film, Fall of the Republic, in the next week and a half, and I am working on just absolutely piles of work, but I would love to be there with you.
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:48.143]  Ah, well, I'll be at the two conferences there, the We Demand Transparency conference at St.
[00:33:48.183 --> 00:33:50.344]  Mark's and the Bowery, the 11th and the 12th.
[00:33:52.026 --> 00:33:54.990]  And then Real Change Conference, the 11th and the 12th also.
[00:33:55.691 --> 00:34:00.598]  Luke Rutkowski's We Are Change group is having some great speakers as well.
[00:34:00.718 --> 00:34:06.927]  So I encourage everybody to come out to New York who can and support us and support these
[00:34:07.772 --> 00:34:13.980]  Incredible truthers who have given so much to wake up the American people.
[00:34:26.576 --> 00:34:27.917]  Fire making the building fall.
[00:34:27.957 --> 00:34:31.038]  It had to be a special building, because FEMA and the command centers were there.
[00:34:31.078 --> 00:34:32.839]  They went in and even added more strength.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:39.523]  This super building, CIA, Defense Intelligence, IRS, Army, FBI.
[00:34:39.543 --> 00:34:44.346]  The whole thing's the second biggest CIA compound outside of Langley in the U.S., they admit.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.584]  And then magically it falls in its own footprint.
[00:34:48.244 --> 00:34:51.047]  You brought that information about underwriting laboratories to them, but they don't care.
[00:34:51.087 --> 00:35:00.854]  They went and got a steel of unknown strength, an alloy, put a big weight over it, with the white tips of the flame, the very hottest part, hitting on it long-wise.
[00:35:01.935 --> 00:35:02.496]  Just amazing.
[00:35:03.328 --> 00:35:11.534]  Yeah, and obviously it's going to fail with 3,000 pound point load right in the center span of the beam.
[00:35:13.135 --> 00:35:14.476]  It's designed to fail.
[00:35:14.537 --> 00:35:15.597]  It's designed to show.
[00:35:15.617 --> 00:35:22.903]  So when it does fail, I can imagine half of the public watching goes, oh, that's what happened to the World Trade Center.
[00:35:22.983 --> 00:35:23.944]  I see it failing.
[00:35:24.344 --> 00:35:25.425]  It's like sheep, you know.
[00:35:25.825 --> 00:35:27.726]  But the fires had almost completely burned out.
[00:35:27.746 --> 00:35:35.788]  There were people in the holes waving for help seconds before they just shatter and the building just, you know, just it's it's it's unbelievable.
[00:35:36.908 --> 00:35:40.269]  It's like watching a volcano explode and saying there was no pressure underneath it.
[00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:48.111]  In the South Tower, the fires were going out after only 56 minutes.
[00:35:48.491 --> 00:35:49.752]  According to the fire department.
[00:35:49.832 --> 00:35:50.852]  According to the fire department.
[00:35:51.894 --> 00:35:56.897]  Yeah, well, Oreo Palmer had reached the 78th floor and he says there's two isolated pockets of fire.
[00:35:57.257 --> 00:35:58.517]  We can put it out with two lines.
[00:35:59.218 --> 00:36:15.246]  And ten minutes later, the 101st responders are witnessing and documenting in their oral recordings sounds of explosions and flashes of light at the onset of the collapses, like a belt wrapping all the way around the building.
[00:36:15.346 --> 00:36:17.347]  It was as if they had detonators!
[00:36:17.487 --> 00:36:18.848]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:36:19.727 --> 00:36:22.189]  Yeah, that's a quote from the fireman.
[00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:37.705]  And we have news reporters on the ground 2,000 feet away from this ducking from the incredible sounds of explosions, which we don't hear on any of the reports.
[00:36:38.466 --> 00:36:42.790]  They systematically take out the sounds of explosions, but there's
[00:36:44.532 --> 00:36:54.863]  Well over a couple of hundred witnesses talking about these incredible explosions and then debris flying everywhere out of the sides of the Twin Towers.
[00:36:55.423 --> 00:37:00.269]  As I mentioned, 600 feet flying laterally at 50 to 70 miles an hour.
[00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:05.992]  And so, this is a gravitational collapse.
[00:37:06.032 --> 00:37:12.336]  We would expect to see 110 floors stacked up at the bottom of each of these buildings.
[00:37:12.456 --> 00:37:14.937]  Guess how many floors we see at the bottom?
[00:37:15.586 --> 00:37:17.708]  And the photographs, the videos, none!
[00:37:18.128 --> 00:37:19.129]  They're all gone.
[00:37:19.149 --> 00:37:24.493]  They've been pulverized and distributed laterally outside the building's footprint.
[00:37:24.873 --> 00:37:26.855]  This is supposed to be a gravitational collapse.
[00:37:26.895 --> 00:37:30.738]  We should have 20 to 40 stories high of floors sitting down there.
[00:37:31.178 --> 00:37:31.859]  Where are they?
[00:37:32.259 --> 00:37:32.920]  They're gone.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.683]  So this is a huge problem for the official story as well.
[00:37:40.196 --> 00:37:52.621]  Well, so I explained very carefully to National Geographic what FEMA found and what FEMA documented in their Appendix C of their May of 2002 DPAT report.
[00:37:53.462 --> 00:37:53.862]  Steel.
[00:37:54.002 --> 00:37:54.942]  Two steel samples.
[00:37:55.062 --> 00:37:58.444]  By the way, the only two steel samples saved from Building 7.
[00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:08.848]  But these two steel samples, they document intergranular melting, rapid oxidation, sulfidation, and even evaporation of the ends of these beams.
[00:38:09.722 --> 00:38:11.823]  The firemen have never seen this before.
[00:38:12.243 --> 00:38:13.463]  So how did this happen?
[00:38:13.563 --> 00:38:24.066]  And so they conclude, FEMA, that their best hypothesis as to how this building came down has only a low probability of occurrence.
[00:38:24.507 --> 00:38:25.847]  Well, what was that hypothesis?
[00:38:26.227 --> 00:38:26.647]  Fire!
[00:38:27.427 --> 00:38:32.289]  And some damage from the beams of the World Trade Center north tower when it went down earlier that morning.
[00:38:33.027 --> 00:38:38.249]  So what happens to this entire... Oh, further research investigation is necessary.
[00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:51.095]  But unfortunately, though, for those hoping to resolve the issue, all of that steel has been recycled to China, and FEMA had ordered the recycling of that steel.
[00:38:51.395 --> 00:38:59.439]  They deny this, but those who do this research end up citing FEMA for giving these orders.
[00:39:00.409 --> 00:39:01.930]  So, they didn't save the steel.
[00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:07.072]  You always save the steel in any kind of a collapse so you can thoroughly understand exactly what happened.
[00:39:07.552 --> 00:39:09.993]  Now, this takes over the investigation after May of 2002.
[00:39:10.073 --> 00:39:17.096]  What did they do with this Appendix C documenting the melting of steel?
[00:39:17.557 --> 00:39:18.457]  They throw it out.
[00:39:18.797 --> 00:39:27.641]  It is not in the final report at all in the World Trade Center 7 that came out in November of just last year, seven years later.
[00:39:28.214 --> 00:39:33.797]  So, they've basically, systematically destroyed even more evidence.
[00:39:34.818 --> 00:39:38.560]  They do not want us to know about molten metal or melting of steel.
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:43.863]  In fact, John Gross denies the pools of molten iron, as it turns out to be.
[00:39:44.023 --> 00:39:47.025]  Stephen Jones and others analyze it, turns out to be molten iron.
[00:39:47.085 --> 00:39:49.587]  And we have all the videos of the firefighters saying it was like a...
[00:39:50.447 --> 00:39:52.788]  Foundry with molten metal running everywhere.
[00:39:52.828 --> 00:39:56.148]  We could play the clips, but they're cussing, including fire captains.
[00:39:57.249 --> 00:39:59.029]  But, I mean, it was just everywhere.
[00:39:59.869 --> 00:40:00.069]  Yeah.
[00:40:00.369 --> 00:40:00.930]  Yeah, it was.
[00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:03.330]  And there's dozens and dozens of witnesses.
[00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:04.570]  There's photographs.
[00:40:05.731 --> 00:40:09.532]  It's all in my film Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:40:09.552 --> 00:40:10.972]  The people really need to get it at InfoWars.com.
[00:40:10.992 --> 00:40:15.333]  It goes through the whole history of this and the modern events, and that's how you really wake somebody up.
[00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:17.233]  I understand you're an engineer, you're an architect.
[00:40:17.654 --> 00:40:19.094]  That's an important area of research.
[00:40:19.694 --> 00:40:22.918]  I saw it and I was very impressed by Terror Storm.
[00:40:23.619 --> 00:40:27.343]  My point is that though there's the other angle where we all see the science in it.
[00:40:27.363 --> 00:40:27.964]  Well thank you Richard.
[00:40:28.705 --> 00:40:37.014]  We go at the history of it that they've done this over and over again and that helps people get past not imagining that government would do this.
[00:40:37.074 --> 00:40:38.496]  Government isn't like the rest of people.
[00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:39.117]  I'm sorry go ahead.
[00:40:40.211 --> 00:40:44.313]  Yeah, it's disturbing because, you know, all of this evidence is clear.
[00:40:44.393 --> 00:40:50.196]  As I mentioned to 90% of the people I talk to, they end up agreeing with us and signing our petition.
[00:40:50.516 --> 00:40:52.257]  But they say, well, what do we do now?
[00:40:52.277 --> 00:40:56.098]  And I'm going, well, we're architecture engineers.
[00:40:56.158 --> 00:40:57.519]  We can carry you this far.
[00:40:57.579 --> 00:41:01.301]  We can give you the evidence that the media, the government, has not given you.
[00:41:01.801 --> 00:41:07.664]  You can see for yourself that this points to something other than some kind of Al-Qaeda attack.
[00:41:08.465 --> 00:41:21.777]  You have got to do the research, and TerrorStorm provides an excellent background as to how these things have been systematic, as you mentioned earlier, with governments inciting wars for profit and control.
[00:41:23.755 --> 00:41:26.979]  But they want to know, well, how do we talk to people?
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:31.664]  Because this is a psychological problem for every American.
[00:41:32.044 --> 00:41:33.086]  Well, it is.
[00:41:33.286 --> 00:41:34.627]  Richard, we're almost out of time.
[00:41:34.647 --> 00:41:35.969]  I want you to be able to finish that last point.
[00:41:35.989 --> 00:41:37.971]  But again, have you talked to the maker?
[00:41:37.991 --> 00:41:41.175]  You've got the transcript, but have you tried to call the guy and say, you lied to me?
[00:41:41.715 --> 00:41:42.877]  Or is he taking your phone calls?
[00:41:43.416 --> 00:41:45.456]  No, he'll talk to me.
[00:41:47.577 --> 00:41:48.917]  We've emailed a couple of times.
[00:41:48.997 --> 00:41:53.198]  I have not presented him with a major confrontation at all.
[00:41:53.578 --> 00:41:57.399]  I'm trying to put my ducks in a row, and now I'm packing up for New York.
[00:41:57.459 --> 00:41:58.519]  It's going to be very difficult.
[00:41:58.539 --> 00:41:59.879]  It's going to take a little bit of time, Alex.
[00:41:59.899 --> 00:42:00.240]  I understand.
[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:04.160]  Next week you're going to get back, focus on it, have a plan, and then come out with it.
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.901]  Well, I think it's important to people when they Google the name of this company.
[00:42:07.641 --> 00:42:07.981]  No.
[00:42:08.581 --> 00:42:09.421]  Who they're dealing with.
[00:42:09.441 --> 00:42:10.522]  I mean, I did some research on them.
[00:42:10.542 --> 00:42:12.602]  I was like, no way am I talking to you guys.
[00:42:13.062 --> 00:42:14.723]  Because I've been around similar people.
[00:42:14.743 --> 00:42:18.864]  When I had the History Channel people here, I knew it was a hit piece.
[00:42:18.884 --> 00:42:21.144]  But when they were, they said, oh, this is fair and we like you.
[00:42:21.184 --> 00:42:22.845]  At the end, they just laughed at me in a parking lot.
[00:42:23.665 --> 00:42:25.685]  And I had the British crew say they were being fair.
[00:42:26.606 --> 00:42:32.627]  And at the end, we went to a Chinese food restaurant and they wrote on a fortune cookie as a joke.
[00:42:32.647 --> 00:42:33.467]  They said, here, open this one.
[00:42:33.507 --> 00:42:34.307]  It's yours at P.F.
[00:42:34.327 --> 00:42:34.668]  Chang's.
[00:42:34.688 --> 00:42:36.088]  And it said, you're dead.
[00:42:37.489 --> 00:42:39.732]  With another British crew, and then I said, is this a joke?
[00:42:39.772 --> 00:42:42.656]  And they said, whatever, we don't like you, and got up and left.
[00:42:43.117 --> 00:42:48.123]  I mean, which is like, they wanted me at the end to know, look, we punked you, we're nasty, we're black ops!
[00:42:49.198 --> 00:42:51.119]  And we love the New World Orders.
[00:42:51.159 --> 00:42:52.259]  That's basically what it was.
[00:42:52.339 --> 00:42:52.860]  Richard, stay there.
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:53.960]  I want to say bye to you on the other side.
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:55.060]  We've got some events coming up.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.561]  I'm going to get into this world government news.
[00:42:56.581 --> 00:42:59.702]  Then Professor Stephen Jones is coming up.
[00:42:59.782 --> 00:43:00.623]  So much is happening.
[00:43:01.023 --> 00:43:08.466]  Airandaqua.com is your one-stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.
[00:43:08.726 --> 00:43:12.830]  AaronAqua.com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and our water.
[00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:17.014]  And they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these harmful toxins.
[00:43:17.334 --> 00:43:21.879]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[00:43:22.079 --> 00:43:25.783]  AaronAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[00:43:26.043 --> 00:43:30.167]  AaronAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[00:43:30.407 --> 00:43:30.887]  I think so.
[00:44:00.894 --> 00:44:02.596]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:44:02.897 --> 00:44:06.341]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:44:06.522 --> 00:44:08.404]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:44:08.985 --> 00:44:11.749]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:44:12.049 --> 00:44:15.794]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding.
[00:44:15.854 --> 00:44:16.174]  We're good.
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:43.504]  From tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library.
[00:44:43.664 --> 00:44:48.229]  By weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:51.032]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.

[00:45:01.565 --> 00:45:10.390]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.

[00:45:58.096 --> 00:45:58.336]  U.S.
[00:45:59.717 --> 00:46:14.328]  News and World Report has the meanest hit piece I've seen by Peter Roth.
[00:46:14.348 --> 00:46:15.568]  I want to try to get him on.
[00:46:17.089 --> 00:46:18.851]  We have the former German defense minister.
[00:46:18.891 --> 00:46:20.932]  We have one of the top people in the Japanese government.
[00:46:20.952 --> 00:46:21.813]  What is he, number two or three?
[00:46:24.201 --> 00:46:31.989]  We have all these scientists, all these engineers, all these physicists, all these military people.
[00:46:33.328 --> 00:46:37.409]  All these firefighters and police, the majority of the victims' family groups, we've had them on the show.
[00:46:38.169 --> 00:46:42.150]  The heads of the groups saying the majority of our members, at least half or more, believe it's an inside job.
[00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.870]  That was three years ago.
[00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:46.911]  We have a New York Times poll, 94% believe the government's lying about 9-11.
[00:46:47.391 --> 00:46:52.632]  Charlie Sheen, three years ago on CNN, 83% in their poll agreed that there was a cover-up.
[00:46:53.392 --> 00:46:54.292]  We're the majority.
[00:46:54.672 --> 00:46:58.693]  And you have this tiny cabal trying to make us feel like we're bad, we're stupid, we're evil.
[00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:05.114]  And when Charlie had this idea for 20 minutes with the President, I had no idea how big it was going to get this quick.
[00:47:05.154 --> 00:47:08.076]  I mean, it's just, it's just off the charts.
[00:47:08.156 --> 00:47:14.280]  I mean, we're talking 24 hours into this, and it is just everywhere.
[00:47:15.861 --> 00:47:18.603]  And Charlie, again, is focused.
[00:47:18.624 --> 00:47:20.925]  He has to, you know, contractual agreements.
[00:47:20.945 --> 00:47:23.167]  He wants to focus on his TV show.
[00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:26.029]  They do the rehearsal tonight, shoot it tomorrow, air it Monday.
[00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:27.870]  Two and a half men.
[00:47:29.016 --> 00:47:35.719]  But next week, he's taking time out Friday to be here, and I've asked him, I said, go ahead and do TV now, but he wants to focus and try to do that.
[00:47:36.019 --> 00:47:40.480]  He may do some stuff on the set, he's not sure if he can duck away on TV.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:41.321]  I've told him, go for it.
[00:47:42.601 --> 00:47:49.344]  National TV is in the works, and a lot of other stuff, and some other things behind the scenes that I don't even want to get into.
[00:47:50.024 --> 00:47:53.105]  I'll let Charlie talk about it on Friday if he wants to, but God, he's got a lot of courage.
[00:47:54.826 --> 00:47:55.606]  Man, this is real.
[00:47:55.626 --> 00:47:57.047]  I can't believe I'm going up against these people.
[00:47:58.069 --> 00:48:01.390]  But I mean, you can't back off when you know they're murderers and did this.
[00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:04.812]  Richard Gage, in closing, you're going to be in New York speaking twice.
[00:48:04.832 --> 00:48:07.973]  People can find out more at Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[00:48:07.993 --> 00:48:08.813]  What's the best website?
[00:48:09.454 --> 00:48:13.555]  Yeah, it's AE911Truth.org.
[00:48:14.075 --> 00:48:15.696]  Stands for Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[00:48:15.736 --> 00:48:16.196]  AE911Truth.org.
[00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:22.993]  And I think, by the way, Alex, National Geographic did us a favor.
[00:48:23.414 --> 00:48:35.403]  That hit face was so bad that even thinking people will see the major, obvious attempt to slander the truth movement and actually look at us and find out what the heck's going on.
[00:48:35.543 --> 00:48:43.405]  And that weird woman's voice, that weird woman's voice going, truth is... Then when she talked about the other people, she had a normal tone.
[00:48:44.245 --> 00:48:46.346]  And it was like a snake voiced it or something.
[00:48:47.106 --> 00:48:48.867]  And it's just an absolute travesty.
[00:48:48.887 --> 00:48:51.748]  Do me a favor, I'm gonna let you go, Mr. Gage, we appreciate your time.
[00:48:52.368 --> 00:48:58.489]  Contact me in a week or so, when you're ready to release those transcripts of what really happened in the interviews, where he's promising he's gonna put that out.
[00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:02.471]  I'd like to have you on the air to expose that, to just show the deception.
[00:49:02.751 --> 00:49:03.591]  God bless you, my friend.
[00:49:04.147 --> 00:49:04.768]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:49:04.848 --> 00:49:05.788]  We'll see you on the road.
[00:49:15.222 --> 00:49:17.043]  I haven't really even thanked any of my sponsors today.
[00:49:17.083 --> 00:49:19.285]  We're coming up with Professor Stephen Jones at 8 after.
[00:49:19.305 --> 00:49:22.407]  I want to hit some World Bank news, World Government news.
[00:49:22.427 --> 00:49:24.508]  I mean, just look at this McClatchy Newspapers.
[00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:26.970]  But I wanted to zoom in on that while I'm plugging this.
[00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:28.771]  I want to tell you about eFoods Direct.
[00:49:28.831 --> 00:49:30.492]  This is the best storable foods company I've found.
[00:49:30.532 --> 00:49:32.293]  I bought from three or four other places samples.
[00:49:32.774 --> 00:49:37.177]  One big load had MSG in it, genetically modified, packaged in foreign countries.
[00:49:37.857 --> 00:49:41.720]  Well, that is not the case, ladies and gentlemen, with eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.782]  And they're the biggest outfit out there and the longest continually operating.
[00:49:45.702 --> 00:49:45.782]  Yes.
[00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:06.535]  If we do turn into Argentina like the Associated Press has Top Economist saying we are, you're going to need to have storable food.
[00:50:06.595 --> 00:50:07.476]  I hope that's not the case.
[00:50:18.976 --> 00:50:19.737]  Maybe we can stop it.
[00:50:20.017 --> 00:50:21.538]  The point is, it's an insurance policy.
[00:50:21.618 --> 00:50:24.620]  eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:31.925]  Don't forget also, I've been so busy I've been plugging the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com with all the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the ball caps.
[00:50:32.226 --> 00:50:33.386]  That funds our operation.
[00:50:33.446 --> 00:50:35.148]  We need your support if you believe in what we're doing.
[00:50:35.588 --> 00:50:40.511]  Make a purchase of the great information today at InfoWars.com or subscribe to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:50:43.133 --> 00:50:44.735]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:50:51.172 --> 00:50:53.774]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:50:54.194 --> 00:50:59.158]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:50:59.519 --> 00:51:01.240]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:06.384]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:51:06.564 --> 00:51:07.525]  How much do you want?
[00:51:07.745 --> 00:51:08.506]  When do you want it?
[00:51:08.886 --> 00:51:10.467]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:51:10.767 --> 00:51:11.588]  When will you need it?
[00:51:11.828 --> 00:51:13.890]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:15.131]  Will there be any food?
[00:51:15.371 --> 00:51:16.692]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:51:16.892 --> 00:51:21.956]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:51:22.156 --> 00:51:25.338]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:51:25.739 --> 00:51:29.241]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:51:29.561 --> 00:51:30.542]  How much will you need?
[00:51:30.782 --> 00:51:31.403]  We don't know.
[00:51:31.683 --> 00:51:32.604]  How much do you want?
[00:51:32.804 --> 00:51:33.524]  All you can get.
[00:51:33.724 --> 00:51:34.485]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:34.805 --> 00:51:37.567]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:51:37.867 --> 00:51:40.048]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:51:40.068 --> 00:51:41.048]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:41.068 --> 00:51:42.209]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:42.229 --> 00:51:44.090]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:08.578 --> 00:52:10.059]  The best of times, the worst of times.
[00:52:10.119 --> 00:52:10.940]  So much happening.
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:15.122]  For those that don't know, we had Charlie Sheen live on today with us.
[00:52:15.142 --> 00:52:19.865]  We also aired that 21-minute interview I did a few weeks ago at his home.
[00:52:20.586 --> 00:52:26.690]  A video interview I did with him is going to be airing tomorrow, and he'll be live with us on the air again Friday for 9-11.
[00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:36.256]  And he's going public for the 9-11 families who've called for a new investigation, for the six 9-11 Commission members of the ten that come out and say it's a fraud, a lie, a hoax.
[00:52:37.771 --> 00:52:42.652]  We're doing this because we want to get the truth out and want our children to live in a free country and a free society.
[00:52:43.012 --> 00:52:44.793]  Hitler used staged terror to get control.
[00:52:44.973 --> 00:52:46.773]  Stalin and Lenin did it to expand control.
[00:52:47.213 --> 00:52:47.714]  Mao did it.
[00:52:47.754 --> 00:52:48.514]  The Tsars did it.
[00:52:50.114 --> 00:52:53.235]  So many other governments do it and the criminals running our nation are doing it.
[00:52:54.215 --> 00:52:56.576]  And people need to face those facts and demand the truth.
[00:52:57.523 --> 00:53:03.067]  Professor Stephen Jones is going to be coming on in about 30-35 minutes, and I am going to hit all this World Bank, World Government news.
[00:53:03.087 --> 00:53:05.048]  Let me just hit on some of it now, but I want to be honest.
[00:53:05.068 --> 00:53:11.353]  I want to dig into my stack from yesterday that was taken off my table, which is good.
[00:53:11.373 --> 00:53:12.874]  The guys clean up my pigsty in here.
[00:53:12.894 --> 00:53:17.137]  It gets really messy, but I had a bunch of articles in my stack.
[00:53:17.517 --> 00:53:26.344]  Oh, here's yesterday's stack, where they're openly announcing Argentine-style collapse for the United States.
[00:53:28.573 --> 00:53:38.855]  And where all of this is coming out, and so I'm going to go over that, and when Professor Jones leaves us, I'm going to cover that in great detail.
[00:53:40.436 --> 00:53:42.256]  But, I mean, here's one from today.
[00:53:42.276 --> 00:53:45.617]  A year after financial crisis, a new world order emerges.
[00:53:46.617 --> 00:53:47.337]  And then here's another one.
[00:53:47.377 --> 00:53:48.878]  Obama to seal U.S.-U.N.
[00:53:48.918 --> 00:53:50.038]  relationship, the first U.S.
[00:53:50.078 --> 00:53:54.139]  president to be a president, and the head of the International Security Council.
[00:53:55.265 --> 00:54:02.788]  And he's also the head of the National Security Council here that runs the FEMA camps, Homeland Security, the 400,000 troops the Army openly says they're going to put on the streets of America.
[00:54:03.308 --> 00:54:14.973]  They're doing acclimation drills everywhere, running checkpoints for PR things that they think the public will buy, helping people at car wrecks with the jaws of life, searching people for alcohol and drugs.
[00:54:15.313 --> 00:54:16.013]  Totally illegal!
[00:54:16.093 --> 00:54:17.994]  Regular Army, regular Marines, confirmed.
[00:54:19.684 --> 00:54:23.168]  I mean, the establishment really wants to take over so they can loot and rob the country.
[00:54:23.188 --> 00:54:25.470]  It's like when a bank robber comes in and says, hands up.
[00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:27.472]  Tells the security guard, drop your gun.
[00:54:27.512 --> 00:54:28.173]  Put your hands up.
[00:54:28.213 --> 00:54:29.494]  I mean, they want our guns.
[00:54:29.514 --> 00:54:30.315]  They're saying, hands up.
[00:54:30.335 --> 00:54:31.496]  They've introduced the bills to do it.
[00:54:31.536 --> 00:54:33.278]  They're saying, hands up with the Army.
[00:54:33.959 --> 00:54:36.882]  The good news is the Army's full of a lot of good, awake people.
[00:54:37.935 --> 00:54:38.736]  Yeah, in many respects.
[00:54:38.756 --> 00:54:41.197]  So they're hiring a lot of illegal aliens and foreigners and criminals.
[00:54:41.777 --> 00:54:42.958]  Now, that's pretty scary.
[00:54:43.398 --> 00:54:46.860]  It's kind of like what the government did shipping in the drugs in the 70s and 80s in Miami.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:51.643]  I was watching a documentary, Cocaine Cowboys, about that jogging on the treadmill this morning.
[00:54:52.944 --> 00:54:57.347]  And it had everything I already knew, but there it was in video with the police saying it, admitting it.
[00:54:59.168 --> 00:55:04.351]  And because of the crime wave, they then got rid of all the rules.
[00:55:04.431 --> 00:55:05.592]  Police could be drug users.
[00:55:06.403 --> 00:55:07.163]  And be on the force.
[00:55:07.203 --> 00:55:13.205]  And police, then it turned out, it said a whole new, the entire new class got killed or went to prison.
[00:55:13.965 --> 00:55:21.647]  The program shows cops saying the entire new class, I think I said of like 1980, 81, I forget, in the film, all died or went to prison.
[00:55:22.308 --> 00:55:23.508]  They were all dealing drugs.
[00:55:23.568 --> 00:55:26.629]  Of course, I mean, it's a $500 million a year industry in the U.S.
[00:55:26.689 --> 00:55:26.969]  alone.
[00:55:28.214 --> 00:55:36.157]  And you can launder that money, so it has that multiple value of the fact that they can launder it and the banks can loan out ten times every dollar they've got.
[00:55:37.037 --> 00:55:39.378]  And then the BBC just calmly admits the U.S.
[00:55:39.438 --> 00:55:42.439]  is guarding their poppy fields, but so the Taliban doesn't get it.
[00:55:43.359 --> 00:55:49.961]  And then you see opium production go up 10, 11, 12-fold last time I checked from the liberation of Afghanistan.
[00:55:50.381 --> 00:55:54.323]  It's about controlling opium, which is another 500 billion globally.
[00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:58.167]  Produces over 80% of the world's opium that's turned into heroin.
[00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:01.094]  So it's just pouring out of there.
[00:56:03.885 --> 00:56:12.207]  Then I hear local police, one local cop's got a radio show, and he's a nice guy, I've met him, but he gets on air and says, I just can't believe that officers would deal drugs.
[00:56:12.727 --> 00:56:14.268]  I can't believe the government would deal drugs.
[00:56:14.288 --> 00:56:15.228]  What are you talking about?
[00:56:15.328 --> 00:56:17.029]  Serpico, all of it, LAPD.
[00:56:17.049 --> 00:56:25.451]  I mean, how many times have the police and the government, the CIA, how many times have CIA aircraft crashed full of cocaine and heroin?
[00:56:26.749 --> 00:56:29.090]  And then they put people in jail if they get caught using it.
[00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:30.191]  I mean, it's a sick joke.
[00:56:30.711 --> 00:56:32.872]  We have to admit the government ships in the drugs.
[00:56:33.352 --> 00:56:34.973]  We have to admit they're staging the terror.
[00:56:35.333 --> 00:56:36.934]  So they can then set up the police state.
[00:56:37.454 --> 00:56:39.315]  Then they got the military involved in the war on drugs.
[00:56:39.335 --> 00:56:40.996]  Now they're going to use the military on the American people.
[00:56:41.516 --> 00:56:43.357]  They got the military involved in fighting Al-Qaeda.
[00:56:43.397 --> 00:56:48.420]  Now they say, oh, Homeland Security document that we broke says we're going to use the Army against you.
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:54.403]  And then we get sent secret documents and they break in mainstream news where the Army's watching me, Ron Paul, and others.
[00:56:54.463 --> 00:56:56.224]  I mean, the Army is watching me?
[00:56:56.784 --> 00:56:57.324]  What for?
[00:56:58.245 --> 00:57:00.105]  I'm calling for peaceful liberation.
[00:57:00.526 --> 00:57:05.688]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:57:05.848 --> 00:57:10.210]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:12.231]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:57:12.651 --> 00:57:13.991]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:57:14.251 --> 00:57:15.292]  There is a solution.
[00:57:15.532 --> 00:57:23.558]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:58:01.449 --> 00:58:02.830]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:03.932 --> 00:58:04.953]  A new world order.
[00:58:05.673 --> 00:58:06.194]  In the near future.
[00:58:07.489 --> 00:58:10.070]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:12.670]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:15.611]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:58:16.171 --> 00:58:18.592]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:58:19.352 --> 00:58:26.653]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:34.673]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:58:35.134 --> 00:58:38.656]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:58:39.016 --> 00:58:41.478]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:58:41.578 --> 00:58:42.719]  Most people have no idea.
[00:58:42.739 --> 00:58:43.499]  They're not after money.
[00:58:43.519 --> 00:58:44.620]  They have all the money they need.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:45.401]  They're after power.
[00:58:45.441 --> 00:58:46.641]  That's what they're after these years.
[00:58:46.942 --> 00:58:55.187]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:55.647 --> 00:58:58.249]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:58:58.449 --> 00:58:59.550]  You have been warned.
[00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:08.715]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[00:59:09.015 --> 00:59:14.097]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[00:59:14.137 --> 00:59:14.698]  and Canada.
[00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:21.541]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[00:59:22.105 --> 00:59:25.368]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[00:59:25.508 --> 00:59:27.750]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[01:00:01.977 --> 01:00:07.561]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:31.357 --> 01:00:36.043]  We've got Professor Stephen Jones coming up here in just a moment with us.
[01:00:38.706 --> 01:00:43.111]  I do want to tell you about one more of the sponsors that has made today's show possible, maybe several.
[01:00:43.131 --> 01:00:47.436]  I tend to not get to these until the end of the show, and they're so incredibly important.
[01:00:47.816 --> 01:00:48.858]  One of them is Acola Blue.
[01:00:49.997 --> 01:00:53.180]  This is just an amazingly high-quality atmospheric water generator.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.201]  Well, they've got a whole line of them.
[01:00:54.221 --> 01:00:56.082]  They've got huge ones they sell to governments and militaries.
[01:00:56.102 --> 01:01:01.047]  They have a small one for the home, looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on top of it.
[01:01:01.707 --> 01:01:13.938]  It grabs water out of the air from panels in the back, puts it through seven filters, including reverse osmosis and carbon, and then has a UV anti-bacteria light in the stainless steel tank inside.
[01:01:14.827 --> 01:01:18.990]  The Acola Blue 28 machine will allow you to get off the grid.
[01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:20.191]  You can even get solar panels.
[01:01:20.231 --> 01:01:23.593]  They sell a converter that goes with it that works just for their machine if you have solar.
[01:01:24.033 --> 01:01:25.554]  Very inexpensive to get that converter.
[01:01:46.048 --> 01:01:49.731]  The Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or office.
[01:01:50.812 --> 01:01:58.880]  Going now to Professor Stephen Jones, who four years ago, now, How Time Flies, went public.
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:06.407]  Stephen Jones, a retired professor of physics, has published papers in Scientific American, Nature, and Physical Review Letters.
[01:02:06.447 --> 01:02:11.011]  His peer-reviewed papers on the collapse of the World Trade Center towers, all three of them.
[01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:12.691]  I think?
[01:02:33.897 --> 01:02:37.980]  Spectrographic analysis of dust and slag from the WTC.
[01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:40.761]  And we really appreciate him coming on.
[01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:47.685]  He's here today to debunk the debunkers who lied to Gage and said, oh, we're going to show you talking about this evidence.
[01:02:48.226 --> 01:02:50.227]  Showed him a rough cut and said, this will be in the show.
[01:02:50.447 --> 01:02:52.788]  They have transcripts of that now, proving it.
[01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:54.229]  They gave him the transcripts.
[01:02:54.529 --> 01:02:58.432]  This same group is known for doing hit pieces on, quote, conspiracy theorists.
[01:02:58.472 --> 01:02:59.232]  It's their specialty.
[01:02:59.613 --> 01:03:00.873]  Creative Differences is the name.
[01:03:01.594 --> 01:03:03.175]  And they also did this ridiculous thermite
[01:03:03.775 --> 01:03:08.799]  I mean, I've seen thermite tests where they put a cup of it over on an engine block, and it melts right through in seconds.
[01:03:08.879 --> 01:03:13.624]  I've seen... But this thermite barely even sparked, but just for a few seconds.
[01:03:14.004 --> 01:03:15.885]  It's saying there were hundreds of pounds on it.
[01:03:16.486 --> 01:03:23.752]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen... And then they acted like explosive thermite didn't exist, nano-thermite, super-thermite.
[01:03:23.812 --> 01:03:24.753]  I mean, this was crazy.
[01:03:25.113 --> 01:03:26.775]  When we have all the patents and the rest of it.
[01:03:27.035 --> 01:03:28.977]  So I wanted to get Professor Stephen Jones on with us.
[01:03:28.997 --> 01:03:29.998]  Professor, it's great to have you.
[01:03:30.543 --> 01:03:33.485]  Thanks Alex, it's great to be with you again here today.
[01:03:34.905 --> 01:03:47.352]  Okay, briefly recap, most people know who you are, but for those that don't, how you got into this, and then let's get into Thermite, Therm-A, the different samples, what it shows, how it fits with the NIST report, fits with the firefighter testimony.
[01:03:47.633 --> 01:03:48.353]  Break it down, sir.
[01:03:48.833 --> 01:03:50.114]  Okay, sure.
[01:03:51.175 --> 01:03:55.657]  Well, to begin, let me start with the Journal of 9-1-1 Studies that you mentioned.
[01:03:55.997 --> 01:03:58.319]  We now have over 100 papers and letters.
[01:03:59.656 --> 01:04:01.978]  So, the list has grown dramatically.
[01:04:02.018 --> 01:04:06.080]  These are all peer-reviewed, and I encourage people to go there.
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:26.214]  Of course, we also have the papers that you mentioned in more established scientific journals, technical journals, civil engineering journals, and, of course, the Open Chemical Physics Journal has our latest paper with Neil Tarrant, Jeff Ferrer, myself, and a total of nine authors, I think.
[01:04:33.123 --> 01:04:35.164]  Let's see, my other phone was ringing, Alex, sorry.
[01:04:35.184 --> 01:04:36.924]  That's okay, sir, go ahead.
[01:04:37.344 --> 01:04:52.989]  So, yeah, it's been quite an adventure trying to explain to people the difference between nanothermite or superthermite, same thing there, compared to ordinary macrothermite.
[01:04:53.649 --> 01:05:01.312]  And I'll tell you, I explained that very carefully to the National Geographic people, and they did get some of that straight, but
[01:05:02.116 --> 01:05:13.460]  You just couldn't seem to bring it to admit that, you know, here's a form of thermite that's nano thermite that's distinctly different from ordinary thermite.
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:19.762]  And the nano thermite is explosive and can be tailored to be a high explosive.
[01:05:20.463 --> 01:05:23.264]  And they just, they just didn't do it.
[01:05:23.284 --> 01:05:27.845]  And then, of course, this test they did, you mentioned that, where they piled up ordinary thermite.
[01:05:27.865 --> 01:05:29.226]  They didn't even put sulfur in it.
[01:05:30.086 --> 01:05:35.369]  That would have been interesting if they'd done at least that, which I talked about in my first paper.
[01:05:35.389 --> 01:05:44.013]  And you and I talked about thermate, which is the sulfur added to thermite, at some length, explaining the difference.
[01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:53.158]  And of course, the sulfur observed in samples of World Trade Center steel, observed by the guys at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and published.
[01:05:54.678 --> 01:05:59.641]  That great mystery, the New York Times said, how did the sulfur get in the steel?
[01:06:02.607 --> 01:06:09.849]  Sorry, clearing my throat a little here, but yeah, so they didn't even add sulfur, and of course they didn't test nanothermite at all.
[01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:21.711]  And they kept saying, I just was reviewing that this morning, the NatGeo program, and they kept saying, well, thermite is not explosive, will not explode.
[01:06:21.731 --> 01:06:30.033]  Well, excuse me, there is a form called nanothermite that will explode, and so, you know, they
[01:06:30.836 --> 01:06:33.758]  Totally obfuscated that important point.
[01:06:34.198 --> 01:06:36.259]  And, you know, I kept hammering that.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:40.542]  They did quote me on that in the program briefly.
[01:06:41.563 --> 01:06:49.648]  But, of course, their test had nothing to do with what we're talking about in the nanothermite paper.
[01:06:50.268 --> 01:06:51.169]  Nothing whatsoever.
[01:06:51.329 --> 01:06:52.569]  No correlation at all.
[01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:59.013]  And I told them, I was really upset when I heard about that in March, that they're proposing this.
[01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:00.950]  Well, not supposedly.
[01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:03.452]  I've already done the experiment.
[01:07:04.052 --> 01:07:05.053]  I called it pathetic.
[01:07:05.153 --> 01:07:12.557]  I said, this in no way represents my views to stack up a bunch of ordinary thermite around a steel column.
[01:07:13.317 --> 01:07:15.118]  I never said anything like that.
[01:07:15.778 --> 01:07:21.001]  We're talking about nanothermite in this paper, and thermate, which is sulfur added to thermite.
[01:07:21.721 --> 01:07:23.623]  It looks like that was also present.
[01:07:24.343 --> 01:07:28.165]  Good evidence for that was the sulfur in the World Trade Center steel sample.
[01:07:29.315 --> 01:07:35.564]  But to do it with ordinary thermite, and the way they did it, is just ludicrous.
[01:07:35.644 --> 01:07:38.368]  And of course, I told them, it's a straw man argument.
[01:07:38.448 --> 01:07:46.339]  It supposedly represents my views, but in no way comes close to what I have stated.
[01:07:47.657 --> 01:08:10.085]  Well, I want to get into the science with you, Professor, today, but first, did they hold out in a dishonest way to you in the way Richard Gage, who I think has the highest credibility, I mean, he doesn't like to get in fights, he doesn't like to be nasty, he puts up with a lot of crap, he's a genteel person, scholarly like yourself, but I mean, he said this was a complete lie, a complete deception, a complete fraud.
[01:08:10.925 --> 01:08:15.787]  Well, you know, I think that there are certainly some elements there.
[01:08:16.363 --> 01:08:20.687]  That I would have to say that Nat Geo was disingenuous.
[01:08:21.628 --> 01:08:31.137]  I mean, I said, look, NIST just can't seem to admit that there is a form of thermite, nanothermite, that is explosive.
[01:08:31.718 --> 01:08:36.302]  I hope you can get that straight and tell the facts.
[01:08:36.322 --> 01:08:40.687]  This is what we're claiming now is nanothermite was the main culprit here.
[01:08:41.266 --> 01:08:47.767]  Oh yeah, they say repeatedly they don't even know if it exists, even though you have all the patents, and NASA uses it, and missile separation.
[01:08:48.327 --> 01:08:57.149]  I mean, it just so happens the Pentagon has a lot, and their scientists just so happen to have those patents, and you've got a bunch of NIST experts that are the few in the world on it, but no big deal.
[01:08:57.169 --> 01:08:57.289]  Right.
[01:08:57.749 --> 01:09:10.711]  And you know, there's data published, as we quoted in our nanothermite paper, we published from Livermore National Laboratory, for example, kiloton and gash and those
[01:09:11.368 --> 01:09:11.848]  Thank you.
[01:09:35.051 --> 01:09:38.334]  complex mix of ultra ultra fine.
[01:09:38.594 --> 01:09:43.539]  This is very exotic and from sample after sample after sample you find the same signature.
[01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:45.300]  That's exactly right.
[01:09:45.821 --> 01:09:57.512]  And so for them to obscure all that, particularly after my, actually I was just pleading with Robert Erickson to please get this straight.
[01:09:58.172 --> 01:10:00.995]  NIST can't seem to admit it but surely you can.
[01:10:02.005 --> 01:10:03.406]  I don't see how you can say it otherwise.
[01:10:22.782 --> 01:10:36.346]  Well, I know you don't get into the Pentagon, but firing missiles into fiberglass chicken coops, and I recognize that's what it looked like out of a farm supply, a fiberglass little thin thing and blowing it up with a pound of plastic explosive and saying a missile would have blown the whole Pentagon up.
[01:10:36.406 --> 01:10:40.367]  I mean, this was, this was just, I mean, I was watching this and I couldn't believe it.
[01:10:41.027 --> 01:10:44.008]  And they would go, the science, the truthers.
[01:10:44.888 --> 01:10:51.130]  And they would like, off the page, have it all crooked, the word truther, even on your name tags to make you look right.
[01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:56.456]  And they wouldn't have the camera shots as nice with you guys, but with their experts they would.
[01:10:58.018 --> 01:10:59.840]  We had History Channel do this to us.
[01:11:01.262 --> 01:11:04.827]  They would do stuff like, I would give a speech to a stand-alone crowd of 600 people.
[01:11:06.226 --> 01:11:06.927]  Yeah.
[01:11:06.947 --> 01:11:07.267]  Uh huh.
[01:11:07.287 --> 01:11:07.387]  Yeah.
[01:11:28.086 --> 01:11:29.046]  He's not popular.
[01:11:29.086 --> 01:11:30.427]  That's what psychology today did.
[01:11:30.467 --> 01:11:32.227]  They said Alex had no friends.
[01:11:32.247 --> 01:11:34.628]  Basically, Alex says he had friends, but we couldn't prove it.
[01:11:34.908 --> 01:11:37.948]  Alex said he has a good family life, but he wouldn't let us talk to his family.
[01:11:38.569 --> 01:11:43.950]  You know, when I have a great family life and great friends and great high school, it's a little too wild.
[01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:46.410]  It was a little too fun.
[01:11:49.904 --> 01:11:55.189]  I mean, again, it's meant to sell the idea that we're like these outcast kooks when we are the majority.
[01:11:55.489 --> 01:11:56.830]  Professor Stephen Jones, stay with us.
[01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:58.111]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:12:01.574 --> 01:12:02.835]  Do you have trouble getting through the day?
[01:12:02.995 --> 01:12:04.337]  Do you feel tired and worn out?
[01:12:04.677 --> 01:12:06.158]  Pounding expensive energy drinks?
[01:12:06.518 --> 01:12:11.102]  It's a proven fact many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[01:12:11.423 --> 01:12:16.027]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.

[01:13:00.836 --> 01:13:01.517]  Hello, friends.
[01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:04.559]  This is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:14.549]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned, pure, handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.

[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:32.102]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Peirce soap products.

[01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:59.073]  You will never use anything else again.
[01:14:01.153 --> 01:14:06.616]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:14:06.876 --> 01:14:08.196]  And we knew what to do.
[01:14:08.216 --> 01:14:09.897]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:14:10.188 --> 01:14:16.571]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:14:17.232 --> 01:14:25.736]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:14:26.124 --> 01:14:32.930]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:14:33.210 --> 01:14:36.273]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:14:36.393 --> 01:14:41.598]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:14:42.159 --> 01:14:44.801]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:14:45.241 --> 01:14:52.468]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at
[01:14:55.502 --> 01:14:56.125]  We're good to go.
[01:15:01.286 --> 01:15:08.571]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:15:08.812 --> 01:15:13.095]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:15:13.315 --> 01:15:18.158]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[01:15:18.479 --> 01:15:25.644]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:15:25.944 --> 01:15:28.746]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the
[01:15:28.766 --> 01:15:29.366]  I think.
[01:15:55.296 --> 01:15:56.136]  269-409-1776 today.
[01:15:56.196 --> 01:15:57.097]  Federal agents!
[01:15:57.297 --> 01:15:58.938]  We are armed!
[01:16:00.498 --> 01:16:07.901]  What would you do if you knew all the things we know?
[01:16:07.921 --> 01:16:11.003]  Would you stand up or shoot?
[01:16:11.063 --> 01:16:14.484]  Or would you turn away till you happened?
[01:16:14.584 --> 01:16:18.466]  What if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[01:16:21.058 --> 01:16:25.081]  Would you stand tall and strong if you saw the things that were wrong?
[01:16:26.363 --> 01:16:28.164]  Well, Professor Stephen E. Jones did.
[01:16:29.525 --> 01:16:34.870]  Kind of like Galileo saying that the earth orbited the sun, not the sun orbiting the earth.
[01:16:36.044 --> 01:16:38.445]  And the truth is coming out, and the system is scared.
[01:16:38.485 --> 01:16:55.370]  Professor Jones, do you agree with me that, or give us your take on this, that we see all these new hit pieces coming out now because they understand 9-11 truth has just continued to grow and didn't go away, it wasn't just a political thing of bashing Bush, that staged terror is something that people really understand now?
[01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:59.031]  I do agree with you there, Alex.
[01:16:59.211 --> 01:17:03.933]  I think that we are making progress worldwide, not just the United States.
[01:17:05.369 --> 01:17:11.373]  Niels Harrod is Professor Harrod in Denmark, gets calls from all over.
[01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:16.477]  He told me that he's been in the media a great deal in Europe.
[01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:23.562]  So I know that in Europe, people are waking up, including Russia, of course, and other countries.
[01:17:23.622 --> 01:17:34.610]  In this country, it seems like every September 11th, we're coming up again, two days, and we get this burst of interest, which is good.
[01:17:35.202 --> 01:17:43.085]  But like you say, then, like the Nat Geo program, we get this mocking, basically, calling us truthers.
[01:17:43.545 --> 01:17:49.307]  And look at these guys' psychology, you know, psychoanalyzing us that we're so paranoid.
[01:17:49.367 --> 01:17:50.647]  I mean, that was the term they used.
[01:17:52.688 --> 01:17:54.248]  As if we can't do science.
[01:17:55.489 --> 01:18:03.912]  That's the beauty of science, as I've repeated, Alex, is that anyone, regardless of belief system, can get the same result.
[01:18:03.932 --> 01:18:04.792]  If anyone will
[01:18:05.461 --> 01:18:07.283]  Take a dare here.
[01:18:07.363 --> 01:18:09.264]  Look at the World Trade Center desk.
[01:18:09.965 --> 01:18:14.609]  You'll see these chips that are red on one side, gray on the other.
[01:18:14.649 --> 01:18:15.530]  Very distinctive.
[01:18:16.050 --> 01:18:19.193]  And then do the test that we did, and you'll get the same result.
[01:18:19.493 --> 01:18:23.436]  Yeah, you're finding the nanothermite, I mean itself, unignited.
[01:18:23.977 --> 01:18:30.823]  There was one issue that had any credibility, the one shred watching the program several times that I thought had any basis.
[01:18:32.082 --> 01:18:34.243]  Was this claim, well, your chain of custody.
[01:18:34.263 --> 01:18:39.825]  But you have FEMA coming in two days after, locking it down, saying federal crime to even take photos.
[01:18:40.266 --> 01:18:48.369]  They cut up the steel, shipped it off, but you and others were able to go to the different states and cities that have gotten it, you know, to build memorials with it.
[01:18:48.389 --> 01:18:51.631]  You were able to get it from people that owned homes or apartments nearby where it was still wrecked.
[01:18:51.651 --> 01:18:51.891]  Right.
[01:18:52.071 --> 01:18:56.173]  I mean, speak to that, because you've got a bunch of different places you've gotten this.
[01:18:57.332 --> 01:18:57.873]  Absolutely.
[01:18:58.593 --> 01:19:02.576]  We've studied in detail six samples now, if I count correctly.
[01:19:02.657 --> 01:19:14.366]  Four are reported in the paper, but we've been looking at more samples, and they all have the same signature of the red-gray material, these chips that still blow up.
[01:19:14.466 --> 01:19:18.209]  The red material side blows up after all these years.
[01:19:19.129 --> 01:19:22.352]  And let me say, in the paper we make an effort
[01:19:22.898 --> 01:19:35.863]  To spell out the chain of custody for those samples that we reported on in the paper, we pointed out the distinct chemical similarity, the chemical signatures being the same in all four samples.
[01:19:36.483 --> 01:19:41.245]  So, really, the basis of maybe someone could... What could it be?
[01:19:41.265 --> 01:19:43.306]  They salted these samples?
[01:19:43.826 --> 01:19:48.868]  How could they reach these independent collectors and New York citizens?
[01:19:50.059 --> 01:19:56.124]  Who did save some of the dust, and I've heard of others since, and I had a call this morning, another fellow had saved some dust.
[01:19:56.164 --> 01:20:00.428]  So, you know, people were saving it as a souvenir, nothing else.
[01:20:01.909 --> 01:20:08.434]  And to suppose that they salted these is, now that's really stretching credulity.
[01:20:09.135 --> 01:20:11.477]  So I haven't heard that argument too much recently.
[01:20:11.937 --> 01:20:17.462]  The one argument I have heard recently, Alex, is, well, Professor Eager.
[01:20:19.293 --> 01:20:19.953]  He'll find anything.
[01:20:19.973 --> 01:20:22.635]  He didn't complain about the chain of custody.
[01:20:22.676 --> 01:20:23.456]  He was complaining.
[01:20:23.496 --> 01:20:26.279]  He said, well, this has got to be primer paint.
[01:20:26.959 --> 01:20:30.042]  This paint that was put on the steel and it's not explosive at all.
[01:20:30.142 --> 01:20:32.724]  It's just paint, you know, ordinary primer paint.
[01:20:32.764 --> 01:20:38.029]  Well, we found a sample of steel.
[01:20:38.529 --> 01:20:44.414]  This is actually at a memorial in, uh, at Clarkson College in New York State.
[01:20:45.195 --> 01:20:46.256]  Like I say, there are these, uh,
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:48.041]  We're good to go.
[01:21:16.195 --> 01:21:17.055]  The World Trade Center
[01:21:39.815 --> 01:21:40.676]  Professor, stay there.
[01:21:40.736 --> 01:21:41.497]  We gotta break.
[01:21:41.537 --> 01:21:42.939]  Come back, continue with that.
[01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:47.283]  Only on the side as we debunk the hit piece put out by National Geographic.
[01:21:47.664 --> 01:21:48.284]  Stay with us.
[01:21:50.927 --> 01:21:51.808]  We're on the march.
[01:21:52.309 --> 01:21:53.911]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.852 --> 01:21:57.535]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:00.384 --> 01:22:04.368]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:22:04.628 --> 01:22:06.410]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:14.918]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:22:15.159 --> 01:22:20.384]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:22:20.704 --> 01:22:22.326]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:22:22.546 --> 01:22:28.888]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:22:29.068 --> 01:22:39.830]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:40.630]  That's right.
[01:22:40.891 --> 01:22:43.211]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:22:43.451 --> 01:22:45.032]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[01:22:46.972 --> 01:22:47.592]  We're good to go.
[01:23:02.975 --> 01:23:05.617]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[01:23:06.058 --> 01:23:08.339]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:12.022]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutraversal Foods.
[01:23:12.463 --> 01:23:18.788]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese, and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[01:23:19.148 --> 01:23:22.690]  Dig into our chili with cornmeal dumplings and you'll feel like a wealthy Texan.
[01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:27.033]  Or sip a cup of warm potato cheddar soup and be soothed on a cold rainy day.
[01:23:27.394 --> 01:23:29.335]  Nutraversal Foods from eFoods Direct.
[01:23:29.655 --> 01:23:30.696]  Your new comfort food.
[01:23:30.996 --> 01:23:33.798]  Incredible taste, easy to prepare, and a long shelf life.
[01:23:34.098 --> 01:23:34.999]  Nutraversal Foods.
[01:23:35.339 --> 01:23:41.723]  More fun while hunting and fishing, bigger tails around the campfire, and the food your kids will want when celebrating the win of a ballgame.
[01:23:42.063 --> 01:23:46.566]  And if it's this great during the good times, imagine how reassuring it will be if times get tough.
[01:23:46.967 --> 01:23:48.688]  Nutraversal Foods by eFoods Direct.
[01:23:49.608 --> 01:23:53.069]  It's here!
[01:23:53.089 --> 01:24:09.253]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:24:09.633 --> 01:24:17.275]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:24:17.972 --> 01:24:25.013]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:24:25.413 --> 01:24:36.815]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:24:37.135 --> 01:24:40.676]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:24:41.096 --> 01:24:43.016]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:24:43.376 --> 01:24:47.217]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:25:19.517 --> 01:25:25.219]  Mexican official confirms jetliner from Cancun hijacked on runway at Mexico City Airport.
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:26.940]  That's all there is.
[01:25:28.561 --> 01:25:33.423]  CNN, just watching it during the break, is saying they may be getting the people off the plane.
[01:25:33.803 --> 01:25:33.423]  999!
[01:25:33.823 --> 01:25:34.943]  You knew something would happen.
[01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:36.904]  Can't wait till this day is over.
[01:25:36.944 --> 01:25:38.585]  The globalists are obsessed with numerology.
[01:25:38.645 --> 01:25:40.005]  Flip 999 over.
[01:25:40.826 --> 01:25:41.366]  What do you get?
[01:25:41.386 --> 01:25:43.187]  Of course, we're coming up on 9-11.
[01:25:44.487 --> 01:25:45.928]  I don't believe in that stuff, but they sure do.
[01:25:47.346 --> 01:25:50.787]  We're going to recap all the huge new developments with the Charlie Sheen exclusive interviews here.
[01:25:50.827 --> 01:25:51.767]  He was live today.
[01:25:52.267 --> 01:25:53.927]  That's coming up in the first hour of the show.
[01:25:53.947 --> 01:25:56.928]  I didn't announce it right at first, but he popped in at the bottom of the hour.
[01:25:56.948 --> 01:26:01.449]  And we aired a, in its entirety, never-before-heard interview I did with him a few weeks ago at his home.
[01:26:02.069 --> 01:26:05.270]  That 21-minute interview aired in the second hour.
[01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:15.852]  And so that is all coming up again at the retransmission points at InfoWars.com and on your local AM and FM stations, Global Shortwave, WWCR, and the satellite.
[01:26:17.401 --> 01:26:23.304]  Going back to Professor Steven Jones and the 10 minutes we have left with him, then I'm going to cover financial news and some other issues.
[01:26:23.704 --> 01:26:27.867]  Professor Jones, you were making a point about... Right.
[01:26:28.167 --> 01:26:30.988]  So you got the paint that was on the steel, not the same thing?
[01:26:31.629 --> 01:26:31.929]  Right.
[01:26:31.969 --> 01:26:33.210]  It's not at all the same.
[01:26:33.610 --> 01:26:37.792]  It's very distinct from the red gray chip material.
[01:26:37.812 --> 01:26:46.797]  Yeah, the paint, just to recap that, as we looked at it using the electron microscopy system,
[01:26:47.635 --> 01:26:51.678]  And x-ray dispersive spectroscopy, that's that term.
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:56.422]  And I tell people that will be on the quiz, you know.
[01:26:56.482 --> 01:27:01.506]  And, you know, I appreciate when people make an effort to understand some of the things that we're trying to do.
[01:27:01.546 --> 01:27:03.828]  We're probing with electron beams.
[01:27:04.589 --> 01:27:07.892]  We're looking at the material that's in the dust.
[01:27:07.932 --> 01:27:11.535]  We're finding this pyrotechnic or explosive material.
[01:27:11.955 --> 01:27:14.937]  You know, I think people understand that that is significant.
[01:27:14.977 --> 01:27:16.919]  It shouldn't be there in quantities like that.
[01:27:17.677 --> 01:27:27.803]  I mean, this was an office building, for heaven's sakes, and the one sample was collected within 20 minutes of the fall of the second tower, the North Tower.
[01:27:28.403 --> 01:27:31.505]  So this cannot be contaminated by cleanup operations.
[01:27:32.246 --> 01:27:37.049]  There were no cleanup operations 20 minutes after the second tower collapsed.
[01:27:37.889 --> 01:27:41.951]  This was a fellow, Frank D'Alessio, scooped that up, got that dust.
[01:27:42.752 --> 01:27:46.194]  We found an abundance of these red grape chips in that sample.
[01:27:46.681 --> 01:27:51.784]  And his friend, what's his name, Breidenbach, also testified.
[01:27:51.824 --> 01:27:53.446]  We have their testimony on tape.
[01:27:53.486 --> 01:28:02.311]  The chain of custody is clear, straight to me, and Jeff Ferrer, Dr. Ferrer at BYU.
[01:28:02.371 --> 01:28:15.400]  So, again, when we compare the primer paint, this is from steel in a monument at Clarkson College in New York State, compare that primer paint with these red gray chips, they are not the same at all.
[01:28:16.212 --> 01:28:19.393]  The primer paint always shows zinc in abundance.
[01:28:19.413 --> 01:28:20.454]  There's a reason for that.
[01:28:21.174 --> 01:28:24.295]  And always shows potassium, always shows magnesium.
[01:28:24.395 --> 01:28:26.556]  This is a fresh surface now.
[01:28:26.616 --> 01:28:31.758]  You break off a chunk and you look at the edge so that you're not talking about dust now.
[01:28:31.778 --> 01:28:38.380]  You're talking about what's in the actual material.
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:45.523]  So the paint shows those elements, zinc, potassium, magnesium, always, whereas the red
[01:28:46.141 --> 01:28:46.481]  I don't know.
[01:29:08.775 --> 01:29:18.757]  Nanothermite paper in the open chemical physics... And you wouldn't put a accelerant, you wouldn't put something explosive as fireproofing on buildings?
[01:29:19.117 --> 01:29:19.997]  Absolutely.
[01:29:20.557 --> 01:29:21.638]  No, absolutely not.
[01:29:21.678 --> 01:29:23.258]  It's a very dangerous material.
[01:29:23.978 --> 01:29:27.339]  You wouldn't want to breathe it in either, Alex, I might say.
[01:29:27.799 --> 01:29:31.840]  It's another, like asbestos, it's one of those bad actors that was in the dust.
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:33.680]  The EPA told us it was safe.
[01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:37.281]  Of course, you know, there's an example of the government lying to us.
[01:29:38.078 --> 01:29:48.787]  In that case, the whistleblower Nikki Tinsley was the EPA General Inspector and she blew the whistle on the EPA for lying to the people about the safety of the dust.
[01:29:48.827 --> 01:29:52.049]  And by the way, seven years ago they would call it a conspiracy theory.
[01:29:52.170 --> 01:29:54.451]  You said Tina Todd Whitten was covering up for Bush.
[01:29:55.012 --> 01:29:58.575]  Later it came out that one of her reports said the dust is dangerous in the first week.
[01:29:59.215 --> 01:30:00.837]  The White House said, shut that down!
[01:30:01.137 --> 01:30:02.698]  That's right.
[01:30:02.798 --> 01:30:04.780]  And the EPA Inspector General Tinsley
[01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:09.232]  She spelled that out and wrote that up in a report and it got into the press.
[01:30:09.912 --> 01:30:13.954]  I think it was in 2003 that that truth came out about what the EPA had done.
[01:30:14.394 --> 01:30:22.618]  So, you know, it's a clear example of where the government, high level, White House, you'd say, has lied to us.
[01:30:23.699 --> 01:30:26.941]  And so now here we have, we're having to ferret this out.
[01:30:27.021 --> 01:30:33.063]  NIST refuses to look for explosive or explosive residues in the World Trade Center dust.
[01:30:33.124 --> 01:30:33.904]  Well, we've done so.
[01:30:34.699 --> 01:30:37.120]  And we challenge them to do so, you know.
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:40.521]  But they have just adamantly refused.
[01:30:41.021 --> 01:30:45.763]  And their excuse is, well, if you look for something that isn't there, you won't find it.
[01:30:45.783 --> 01:30:46.944]  And I'm saying, excuse me?
[01:30:46.984 --> 01:30:49.525]  How do you know it's not there until you look?
[01:30:50.065 --> 01:30:50.385]  You know?
[01:30:51.045 --> 01:30:52.486]  But it's just really remarkable.
[01:30:53.146 --> 01:31:02.890]  And if I may throw in another one, which of course was missed by the Nat Geo program, that is the free-fall acceleration of World Trade Center 7.
[01:31:04.025 --> 01:31:10.168]  For over two seconds, and that's over a hundred feet, the roof was measured by David Chandler.
[01:31:10.688 --> 01:31:18.912]  I looked at this too, but to David's credit, he plotted the data, you know, and showed this is essentially freefall.
[01:31:19.432 --> 01:31:21.473]  And then he and I both challenged NIST.
[01:31:21.673 --> 01:31:28.436]  Remember last August they had this forum where you could send in questions by email, which I did and he did.
[01:31:28.456 --> 01:31:32.698]  We both challenged them on their statements about the rate of fall of the
[01:31:33.331 --> 01:31:34.191]  World Trade Center 7.
[01:31:35.552 --> 01:31:41.213]  And sure enough, NIST, now this is a little bit to their credit, they came back and plotted the data.
[01:31:41.473 --> 01:31:45.334]  It agrees, it lines up with free fall acceleration.
[01:31:45.394 --> 01:31:49.015]  It lines up with what David Chandler and I were trying to say.
[01:31:50.115 --> 01:31:56.077]  And so they admitted that, but to their great discredit, they did not go back and say, well, this is really strange.
[01:31:56.097 --> 01:31:58.117]  That means there's nothing impeding the fall.
[01:31:58.237 --> 01:31:59.258]  That's what free fall means.
[01:31:59.278 --> 01:32:00.178]  There's nothing in the way.
[01:32:01.121 --> 01:32:03.903]  You know, you've got hundreds of thousands of tons of steel and concrete.
[01:32:03.983 --> 01:32:07.045]  These beams don't just give up and disappear.
[01:32:07.205 --> 01:32:10.247]  Their mass alone would slow the roof down, but nothing slowed it down.
[01:32:10.908 --> 01:32:13.890]  Now, that takes explosives to move this material out of the way.
[01:32:14.591 --> 01:32:20.375]  It's a prime evidence for explosives, along with the red chips that we have found.
[01:32:20.955 --> 01:32:29.241]  But what NIST did, they swept that data, they showed that plot, but then they say, oh, this is consistent with our computer model, and that's the end of that.
[01:32:29.281 --> 01:32:30.782]  We're not going to discuss it anymore.
[01:32:31.969 --> 01:32:45.058]  And so you know that a computer model, which they will not let us test, I mean, it just can't be, Alex, that having hundreds of thousands of tons of material on the way and you get free fall.
[01:32:45.618 --> 01:32:56.166]  Unless they took that out of a computer model, which actually you can do in a computer simulation, but you can't do that in real life unless you use explosives to move the material out of the way.
[01:32:57.096 --> 01:33:04.325]  But underwriting laboratories, in their own report, said that they did fire testing for similar things and it didn't make anything collapse.
[01:33:04.525 --> 01:33:06.247]  And it didn't fail, did not fail, right?
[01:33:06.367 --> 01:33:07.789]  Kevin Ryan pointed that one out.
[01:33:08.770 --> 01:33:13.216]  And he lost his job over making that one public, as I recall, that was the issue.
[01:33:14.093 --> 01:33:14.733]  That's right.
[01:33:14.873 --> 01:33:20.476]  You were persecuted, no doubt, and driven out of your professorship, even though you were one of the top lights at that university.
[01:33:21.737 --> 01:33:23.938]  Huge developments and discoveries in your own right.
[01:33:24.499 --> 01:33:28.661]  But the truth is the truth, and God loves you for what you've done, and the American people do.
[01:33:28.681 --> 01:33:33.343]  I hear there's a film coming out soon with a lot of the material that you've presented in it.
[01:33:34.744 --> 01:33:37.926]  With material that I presented included in the bill?
[01:33:38.527 --> 01:33:39.508]  No, no, in a film.
[01:33:39.548 --> 01:33:39.948]  I'm sorry.
[01:33:40.028 --> 01:33:40.728]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:33:40.989 --> 01:33:41.689]  A film, yes.
[01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:43.010]  Yeah.
[01:33:43.330 --> 01:33:45.611]  Dylan Avery and his guys are doing one.
[01:33:45.631 --> 01:33:46.772]  Is that the one you're talking about?
[01:33:47.313 --> 01:33:50.615]  Well, there's that one, but I've seen other stuff on the web.
[01:33:50.635 --> 01:33:53.917]  I guess a lot of people are just taking your material then and making films.
[01:33:53.957 --> 01:33:56.258]  That is very, very exciting, Professor.
[01:33:56.779 --> 01:34:00.701]  Yeah, and you know, it's not, again, I have to emphasize, it's not just me, Alex.
[01:34:01.181 --> 01:34:06.805]  I worked with Neil Tarrant and Dr. Ferrer, Kevin Ryan, Frank Leakey.
[01:34:07.452 --> 01:34:08.853]  I don't know.
[01:34:28.152 --> 01:34:37.957]  Uh, but I wish three years ago I had medical doctors on and they said, look, in the trials of Gardasil, human papillomavirus vaccine, it's killing girls and maiming and paralyzing them.
[01:34:37.997 --> 01:34:41.159]  And I went on air and talked about it and got made fun of by the media.
[01:34:41.179 --> 01:34:49.083]  And then now it's all over the news everywhere I turn, uh, where the human papillomavirus shot is killing or maiming or paralyzing people.
[01:34:49.163 --> 01:34:51.845]  I mean, we're just, we're just trying to tell the truth here.
[01:34:51.885 --> 01:34:52.725]  It's not enjoyable.
[01:34:52.765 --> 01:34:53.286]  I'll tell you.
[01:34:54.026 --> 01:34:55.287]  I totally agree with you.
[01:34:55.447 --> 01:34:57.328]  And it does, uh, there's a personal cost.
[01:34:57.975 --> 01:34:58.875]  As you and I both know.
[01:34:59.956 --> 01:35:03.956]  I wanted to ask you, Alex, if I can turn the tables just for a minute.
[01:35:04.697 --> 01:35:10.058]  I'm really curious what you're finding out about this vaccine for the swine flu.
[01:35:11.138 --> 01:35:15.399]  And I'm sorry if I changed the topic, but I just got to ask you that question.
[01:35:15.559 --> 01:35:22.081]  Do you have any, I'm sure you have some strong feelings, but any advice of what we can do about what's coming down the pike?
[01:35:22.574 --> 01:35:33.021]  You know, there's so many pieces of political data, socioeconomic data, so many medical doctors and scientists and virologists I've interviewed and all the different perspectives.
[01:35:33.682 --> 01:35:39.846]  It's almost like I've over-analyzed it to the point of, we know it's a lie, we know it's a fraud.
[01:35:40.306 --> 01:35:46.711]  We knew in January they were gearing up for quarantines, mass graves, federalization, Northcom to put 400,000 troops on the streets.
[01:35:48.732 --> 01:35:50.574]  And we saw all these movements in January.
[01:35:50.614 --> 01:35:58.182]  I went on air and said, I believe it's flu-related, because emergency managers in Chicago and in Indiana were telling me this, and in upstate New York.
[01:35:58.222 --> 01:36:00.504]  Then I got secret documents and published them.
[01:36:01.365 --> 01:36:03.127]  And we said, this isn't a drill.
[01:36:03.227 --> 01:36:07.211]  They're not using this just as a cover for federalization.
[01:36:08.672 --> 01:36:11.133]  The banks are financing this worldwide.
[01:36:11.213 --> 01:36:19.536]  It's kind of a way, if they want to worldwide shut everything down during the economic implosion of their engineering in the fall, that they're going to use this to clamp down.
[01:36:19.556 --> 01:36:20.756]  I said that in January.
[01:36:21.657 --> 01:36:23.257]  Then in April, the flu popped up.
[01:36:24.357 --> 01:36:28.059]  We said regular flu kills over 36,000 people every year.
[01:36:28.099 --> 01:36:30.119]  Why are they fear-mongering over a few deaths?
[01:36:30.179 --> 01:36:30.720]  Now it's over 500.
[01:36:32.475 --> 01:36:36.140]  Why did it come out in the wrong year, wrong time of year, wrong hemisphere?
[01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:36.681]  Why?
[01:36:36.701 --> 01:36:38.063]  I had a virologist on.
[01:36:38.083 --> 01:36:40.566]  It was in BBC News saying it's a manufactured flu.
[01:36:40.987 --> 01:36:43.189]  We can look at its pedigree and tell it just came out of nowhere.
[01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:45.332]  It's been engineered part human, part bird, part pig.
[01:36:48.703 --> 01:36:55.445]  So the question is, is it just engineered hype to get federalization in place as a cover without a bunch of death and forced inoculations?
[01:36:56.046 --> 01:36:57.906]  Or is it a cover just to sell a bunch of vaccines?
[01:36:58.086 --> 01:36:59.127]  Or are they really planning?
[01:36:59.147 --> 01:37:00.967]  Do they know it's going to mutate into something more deadly?
[01:37:01.668 --> 01:37:07.650]  Vaccine trials in Europe have killed a bunch of people with different flu vaccines in the last year, namely bird flu.
[01:37:08.730 --> 01:37:10.851]  There's internal CDC reports that have come out.
[01:37:11.886 --> 01:37:23.623]  Admitting that this could cause that Gillian Bernays disorder and nerve degeneration and even death that happened in 76 with the same type of swine flu that popped up at a military base after inoculations.
[01:37:24.775 --> 01:37:26.295]  But people don't seem to be buying this.
[01:37:26.335 --> 01:37:29.716]  Remember back in 2002, they tried the Model State Self-Emergency Powers Act.
[01:37:29.996 --> 01:37:37.818]  Tried to order all first responders, nurses, doctors, police, firemen, 14 million total, the LA Times reported, to take these inoculations.
[01:37:39.259 --> 01:37:40.579]  And for smallpox.
[01:37:41.519 --> 01:37:44.680]  But then Tommy Thompson wouldn't even take it, so the whole thing fell apart.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:51.082]  So they keep trying this, but usually when it's just a hype thing they're doing, they don't build up all these assets.
[01:37:52.017 --> 01:37:56.762]  And so, I think it's an ace in the hole for them to release something else if they want.
[01:37:56.782 --> 01:38:05.990]  I mean, we know it's staged, but at a certain point then, we know what they're saying is a lie, we know it's staged, but we don't know what their exact playbook is.
[01:38:07.171 --> 01:38:08.693]  Or exactly when.
[01:38:09.774 --> 01:38:15.680]  If I could interject, too, one thing I really appreciate about you, Alex, is your personal research.
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:16.881]  I'm sure you have a team.
[01:38:17.771 --> 01:38:24.515]  You have these facts right at your fingertips, and I think it's great on a variety of subjects that correlate.
[01:38:25.255 --> 01:38:28.517]  And the second point, I really appreciate that about you and your program.
[01:38:28.897 --> 01:38:38.602]  The second thing I wanted to say was that I could ask, I just asked you the other day, oh, you know, maybe 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:38:38.702 --> 01:38:44.065]  I mean, maybe the government knew about it or let it happen, you know, but what difference does it make, really?
[01:38:44.125 --> 01:38:45.125]  I mean, it's over with.
[01:38:45.205 --> 01:38:45.665]  It's past.
[01:38:45.685 --> 01:38:46.626]  It's eight years ago.
[01:38:47.285 --> 01:38:57.893]  And I said, look, these same people, the puppeteers there, if you get the big picture, it's not over.
[01:38:58.473 --> 01:39:12.663]  And the sooner we wake up, the sooner we can do something to change our republic, to have this renaissance that we need to clean up these guys, if we possibly can at this late date.
[01:39:16.654 --> 01:39:25.484]  I mean, every time I think about getting set up, getting put in prison, getting killed, and I'm not trying to get sympathy here, folks.
[01:39:25.544 --> 01:39:32.591]  I mean, I don't even tell you a tenth of the stuff that goes on behind the scenes, but I live in like a James Bond movie, but I'm not James Bond.
[01:39:32.611 --> 01:39:33.392]  I'm just an average guy.
[01:39:36.313 --> 01:39:44.175]  Whenever it's overwhelming or I wake up at 3 a.m., like, not even fear, but more just gripped by the enormity, I think about my children, but other people's children.
[01:39:44.195 --> 01:39:44.755]  And you're right.
[01:39:45.075 --> 01:39:48.376]  These sickos that did this are going to continue to stage events.
[01:39:48.396 --> 01:39:49.856]  They're going to continue to do wicked things.
[01:39:49.896 --> 01:39:51.377]  It wasn't George Bush that did this.
[01:39:51.417 --> 01:39:53.757]  It was the National Security Council.
[01:39:53.777 --> 01:39:55.678]  It was the private corporate takeover above them.
[01:39:56.238 --> 01:40:00.741]  You know, the CFR wrote manuals how they needed big catalyzing terror events and Cheney did.
[01:40:00.761 --> 01:40:01.782]  Right.
[01:40:02.122 --> 01:40:03.103]  And I'm in this.
[01:40:03.143 --> 01:40:07.466]  When I got involved 13 and a half, 14 years ago, I had no idea how deep it was, how bad it was.
[01:40:07.866 --> 01:40:08.767]  I was naive.
[01:40:08.887 --> 01:40:10.648]  I was just standing up for the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[01:40:11.549 --> 01:40:14.090]  And now I realize I'm point of no return.
[01:40:14.250 --> 01:40:14.971]  I can't go back.
[01:40:15.011 --> 01:40:16.332]  But plus, none of us can go back.
[01:40:16.732 --> 01:40:20.935]  Even if people live in denial and say this isn't happening, you know, you can't go back.
[01:40:20.995 --> 01:40:22.836]  You can't go back once you know the truth.
[01:40:23.957 --> 01:40:24.618]  That's right.
[01:40:25.118 --> 01:40:26.259]  Yeah, I felt the same way.
[01:40:26.759 --> 01:40:33.785]  When I learned about this, it was actually spring of 2005 when I first saw World Trade Center 7 coming down.
[01:40:33.805 --> 01:40:38.189]  And the way it came down, I pulled out my stopwatch, you know, and I was reading and analyzing.
[01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:42.813]  And, man, it just hit me like a ton of bricks.
[01:40:42.873 --> 01:40:47.677]  And then, you know, I'm reading this, what was the name, PNAC report that came out in
[01:40:49.662 --> 01:40:52.043]  Well, it came out just about a year ago.
[01:40:52.063 --> 01:40:55.005]  September 20th, 2000, rebuilding America's defenses.
[01:40:55.105 --> 01:40:55.405]  Right.
[01:40:55.765 --> 01:41:02.328]  So just one year before 9-11, 2001, and I think, man, these guys are talking about American empire.
[01:41:02.869 --> 01:41:04.730]  And they're not even, you know, hiding it.
[01:41:04.770 --> 01:41:10.352]  They want hegemony, domination, using United States military power.
[01:41:10.953 --> 01:41:15.255]  And they say we've got to have a Pearl Harbor style event to do it.
[01:41:15.555 --> 01:41:17.216]  Pearl Harbor killed 3,000, 9-11 killed right at 3,000.
[01:41:17.256 --> 01:41:17.336]  Yeah.
[01:41:19.929 --> 01:41:28.938]  I mean, yeah, and so anyway, it hit me and, you know, a lot of my family now have awakened to this situation.
[01:41:29.278 --> 01:41:30.619]  Awful situation, really.
[01:41:30.679 --> 01:41:33.462]  But, you know, there are some things we feel that we are doing.
[01:41:34.002 --> 01:41:36.285]  It's not totally pessimistic, is it?
[01:41:36.685 --> 01:41:40.989]  People like you and I are speaking out, doing what we can.
[01:41:41.049 --> 01:41:44.913]  And then, you know, I always like to encourage people to get food storage.
[01:41:45.831 --> 01:41:49.372]  I'm sure glad I bought some gold and silver a few years ago.
[01:41:49.432 --> 01:41:50.852]  Gold just went over $1,000 an ounce.
[01:41:50.872 --> 01:41:52.433]  Did you see that?
[01:41:53.333 --> 01:41:53.833]  Yeah, I did.
[01:41:53.853 --> 01:41:55.493]  We told people to buy it when it was $300.
[01:41:55.974 --> 01:41:56.834]  But we're not perfect.
[01:41:56.874 --> 01:41:57.214]  We try.
[01:41:57.254 --> 01:41:58.214]  I mean, I buy gold.
[01:41:58.294 --> 01:41:58.974]  I've got guns.
[01:41:59.034 --> 01:41:59.654]  I've got food.
[01:41:59.995 --> 01:42:01.015]  I'm not looking for trouble.
[01:42:01.135 --> 01:42:10.297]  I just know that when you leave us in the final segment, I'm going to hit the news where top economists are in major news saying the dollar will probably die in the next two years.
[01:42:10.637 --> 01:42:12.217]  We will probably be like Argentina.
[01:42:12.458 --> 01:42:13.738]  I'm not the one saying that.
[01:42:14.378 --> 01:42:16.359]  But we knew years ago they were planning it.
[01:42:16.759 --> 01:42:22.983]  Professor, I'd like to have you back sometime just on your political beliefs and ideas, because I find this very refreshing discussing it with you.
[01:42:23.063 --> 01:42:25.124]  Fire out the websites for folks.
[01:42:26.024 --> 01:42:27.085]  Okay, websites.
[01:42:27.825 --> 01:42:32.768]  Let me start with journalof911studies.com.
[01:42:33.969 --> 01:42:40.232]  And that has over a hundred peer-reviewed papers, and then plus it links to our three major papers in it.
[01:42:40.252 --> 01:42:41.093]  We're almost out of time.
[01:42:41.133 --> 01:42:41.773]  Fire out the other.
[01:42:42.693 --> 01:42:43.154]  Oh boy.
[01:42:45.909 --> 01:42:49.732]  Gosh, uh, STJ911, AE911truth.org.
[01:42:50.352 --> 01:42:50.892]  Professor?
[01:42:51.073 --> 01:42:53.054]  Oh, one more thing, quick, Alex.
[01:42:53.094 --> 01:42:56.056]  We're starting up a scientist for 9-11 Truth.
[01:42:56.817 --> 01:42:58.738]  That should be out here next week, I hope.
[01:42:59.058 --> 01:43:00.039]  Awesome, God bless you.
[01:43:01.533 --> 01:43:10.178]  Did you know that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, and your congressional candidate, Robert Beatles, wrote a 72-page book on how to become wealthy?
[01:43:10.498 --> 01:43:12.960]  It doesn't matter if you are poor or wealthy.
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:14.541]  This book is for you.
[01:43:14.881 --> 01:43:19.984]  The book tells you how to create and protect your wealth, and it's called, Here's What You Do.
[01:43:20.284 --> 01:43:24.026]  You can buy it for only $6 at here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:43:24.266 --> 01:43:26.188]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:43:26.508 --> 01:43:28.709]  Again, here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:43:29.049 --> 01:43:29.750]  Buy it today.
[01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:31.631]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:43:31.791 --> 01:43:36.194]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:43:36.374 --> 01:43:42.058]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:43:42.178 --> 01:43:45.600]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:48.422]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:43:48.542 --> 01:43:53.465]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:43:53.606 --> 01:43:53.826]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:43:53.866 --> 01:43:55.247]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:44:01.311 --> 01:44:06.616]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:07.116 --> 01:44:14.083]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:44:14.703 --> 01:44:20.869]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:21.269 --> 01:44:23.110]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:23.251 --> 01:44:25.672]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:44:25.752 --> 01:44:36.720]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:38.641]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:39.001 --> 01:44:40.402]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:44:40.863 --> 01:44:47.087]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:45:22.193 --> 01:45:22.633]  We're good to go.

[01:46:29.437 --> 01:46:36.888]  Coming up in the next hour at InfoWars.com on the audio streams and AM and FM's that re-air it, Charlie Sheen live on air and the taped interview with Charlie Sheen.
[01:46:37.589 --> 01:46:40.433]  We cover all that coming up if you missed any of it, all the big developments there.
[01:46:43.462 --> 01:46:46.323]  You know, I've got to do at least an hour tomorrow on the show with this.
[01:46:46.883 --> 01:46:59.446]  And for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, you can see this, but for online folks, Obama to seal US-UN relationship to become head of the UN Security Council, at the same time as being president, first time ever, merging us with the UN, basically, Financial Times of London.
[01:47:00.306 --> 01:47:04.167]  McClatchy News, a year after financial crisis, a new world order emerges.
[01:47:05.428 --> 01:47:07.608]  UN panel calls for dollar reserve to be eliminated.
[01:47:07.988 --> 01:47:10.829]  That is the United Nations, and Obama's bringing us into this.
[01:47:12.342 --> 01:47:13.823]  That is Wall Street Journal.
[01:47:14.604 --> 01:47:16.845]  Barack Obama accused of making depression mistakes.
[01:47:17.345 --> 01:47:22.809]  Then it goes on to say top economist of George Mason University.
[01:47:23.209 --> 01:47:24.750]  It is also not impossible that the U.S.
[01:47:24.770 --> 01:47:32.896]  will experience the kind of economic collapse from first to third world status experienced by Argentina under the National Socialist government of Juan Perón.
[01:47:34.907 --> 01:47:35.127]  U.N.
[01:47:35.167 --> 01:47:37.168]  wants new global currency to replace dollar.
[01:47:37.208 --> 01:47:39.550]  That's a London Guardian, another article in the London Telegraph.
[01:47:39.850 --> 01:47:42.712]  Nancy Pelosi, every aspect of her life must be subject to inventory.
[01:47:43.492 --> 01:47:45.673]  France mulls CO2 taxes on all citizens.
[01:47:45.713 --> 01:47:47.394]  Everything you eat, everything you do, tract.
[01:47:47.614 --> 01:47:48.675]  You get a carbon ration.
[01:47:49.015 --> 01:47:51.056]  We had the British scientist calling for that a few months ago.
[01:47:51.376 --> 01:47:55.599]  German government advisor, top environment guys, propose a CO2 budget for everyone on planet.
[01:47:56.806 --> 01:48:04.293]  If you complain about your daughter getting killed or paralyzed, Times of London from Gardasil, they take your other children, Times of London, they're going to take your kids away to fat camps.
[01:48:04.333 --> 01:48:10.699]  They're saying in England they want tens of thousands of kids to be taken at birth and raised in government dormitories first, while the parents prove they can be parents.
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:14.282]  This is what's going on financially and politically.
[01:48:14.302 --> 01:48:16.584]  I mean, this is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:17.287 --> 01:48:21.033]  And if we let the bankers know we're not going to go along with it, they won't bankrupt everything.
[01:48:21.314 --> 01:48:24.219]  Just like if we let them know they're behind the flu stuff, they'll back off.
[01:48:24.239 --> 01:48:28.446]  I wanted to bring Ted up in the last three minutes before we go into retransmission on Infowars.com.
[01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:34.832]  Ted, and there's so many big developments coming up this week, I haven't even told you about, other special celebrity guests.
[01:48:35.352 --> 01:48:37.273]  Looks like Thursday or Friday, tomorrow or Friday.
[01:48:37.993 --> 01:48:50.638]  Ted, briefly, you've still got gold you bought at the $9.45 level, silver you bought when it was $2, less than it is now, you're almost running out, you told me during a break earlier, you want to give people this offer, this may be the last time, you were selling it for $905 an ounce a week ago.
[01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:54.891]  It's up at $1,000 right now, a bit above $1,000.
[01:48:56.012 --> 01:48:57.213]  People can get this right now.
[01:48:57.253 --> 01:48:58.935]  Tell folks the offer you've got, Ted Anderson.
[01:48:59.255 --> 01:49:04.961]  Well, here's the best offer that I have right now, bar none of the Walking Liberty halves, and they're at $8.69.
[01:49:05.701 --> 01:49:09.065]  That's relative to the spots over at $11 an ounce.
[01:49:09.145 --> 01:49:09.785]  Right now it's about $16.50.
[01:49:09.905 --> 01:49:13.189]  So that's below spot.
[01:49:13.309 --> 01:49:14.430]  Excuse me, that's below spot.
[01:49:14.770 --> 01:49:18.452]  Yeah, it was below where the spot is today when I originally accumulated this deal.
[01:49:18.472 --> 01:49:20.033]  You can't get a better deal in silver.
[01:49:20.053 --> 01:49:21.873]  Okay, below spot silver, tell us about the gold.
[01:49:22.254 --> 01:49:27.416]  Yeah, the gold right now, the best thing in gold right now, are they going to be the $10 Liberty at $818.50?
[01:49:27.836 --> 01:49:30.037]  Or pick up the British Sovereign of the Frank at $233 and $288?
[01:49:32.378 --> 01:49:34.339]  Alex, the markets are going like this.
[01:49:34.379 --> 01:49:40.681]  The United States market's trying to press gold down, and once the Asian markets open up, gold goes back up over $1,000 an ounce.
[01:49:40.721 --> 01:49:44.923]  It's been as high as $1,005 today, and you can just see it.
[01:49:44.963 --> 01:49:47.004]  The Asian people want to get out of the U.S.
[01:49:47.064 --> 01:49:54.666]  dollar, and the Federal Reserve System here in New York, which is where the comics is, is trying to push it down when the New York market opens up.
[01:49:54.686 --> 01:49:56.227]  So it's kangarooing, folks.
[01:49:56.707 --> 01:49:58.149]  Can't beat these gold and silver deals.
