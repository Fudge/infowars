[00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:03.510]  Seminal film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:20.916]  And I've been talking more and more about Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement as of late because they've passed the total carbon tax takeover of all society is to be selectively enforced, home inspectors, federal zoning, they say they can throw you out of your house, no judge, no jury, total control, it's meant to create a post-industrial world.
[00:00:21.836 --> 00:00:38.402]  And Dr. Michael Kaufman, in my film, Endgame, and in the extra that's on PrisonPlanet.TV, Endgame 1.5, lays out their own documents where they want a planetary, tyrannical government to carry out forced sterilization, the end of the family, children being raised in government hives.
[00:00:39.943 --> 00:00:43.064]  Now, this was covered
[00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:52.134]  In detail, really all in one place, an 1100 page book titled Ecoscience, written by Obama's science czar.
[00:00:53.595 --> 00:01:00.141]  Who lied before Congress because some of his anti-population stuff had come out and said, no, I don't believe the government has a role in controlling population.
[00:01:00.521 --> 00:01:03.024]  This is a guy who believes in a one world government to carry this out.
[00:01:03.424 --> 00:01:10.050]  Al Gore last week in England said on television he wants a world government to carry out this program.
[00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.852]  And I have stacks of mainstream news.
[00:01:11.892 --> 00:01:13.733]  I'm going to show some of it in this hour.
[00:01:14.654 --> 00:01:23.398]  Where they say in the US, in Europe, in Canada, in Australia, babies are bad, one-child policy, taxes on the carbon of humans.
[00:01:23.758 --> 00:01:28.120]  They picked carbon because that's what humans exhale, two and a half pounds a day.
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.822]  Now our guest, Dr. Michael Coffin, we're about to go to break but I want to bring him up,
[00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:38.840]  He has a bachelor's in forestry and an M.S.
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.161]  in biology at Northern Arizona University and a Ph.D.
[00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:45.542]  in forest science at the University of Idaho.
[00:01:47.262 --> 00:01:52.884]  And he is a ecologist who is involved in ecosystem research for over 20 years in both academia and industry.
[00:01:53.564 --> 00:01:56.825]  And he's taught and worked across a wide spectrum including the U.S.
[00:01:56.885 --> 00:02:04.448]  Forest Service in developing an ecological land classification system for each of the national forests in Region 9 being used today.
[00:02:05.348 --> 00:02:15.473]  And he was instrumental in beating one of the big treaties in the 90s that would have given total control in these wilderness corridors, shutting down human activity.
[00:02:15.933 --> 00:02:25.517]  It's all about making us dependent, shutting off resources in a neo-feudal or neo-serf system so that we can't afford to even get married or have kids.
[00:02:25.677 --> 00:02:49.407]  And this is all stated, but it's stated in the United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment 96, and a part of it's stated in the State Department memorandum 200, and the CIA addendum to that, written by Kissinger, and it's restated in environmental policy reports, the Club of Rome reports, or in articles written by His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh, or in statements in funding by Bill Gates or Ted Turner or Warren Buffet in eugenics.
[00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:55.209]  But this new report by Holdren, it's all in one place.
[00:02:56.601 --> 00:02:58.002]  And that's why this is so important.
[00:02:58.022 --> 00:03:15.275]  So when we come back, we're going to be talking to Dr. Michael Kaufman today about all the big developments with the greenhouse gas, what it will do, how it will control our lives, how the new Bank of the World will regulate global carbon taxes, and we will pay our money into this private group.
[00:03:16.275 --> 00:03:17.276]  And their own statements.
[00:03:18.337 --> 00:03:19.238]  Their own statements.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:38.742]  uh... dealing with how this will be a managed economy and how we will pay our taxes to the new bank of the world this is gone from dr michael kaufman and myself with the documents being called kooks a decade ago and dr kaufman almost sheepishly saying i know this sounds kooky but here's the document to now hundreds of articles a week
[00:03:39.503 --> 00:03:44.926]  By the mainstream media admitting all this, but saying it's a good thing and we should accept it.
[00:03:44.946 --> 00:03:50.329]  So we're going to go through the mindset, the philosophy of these people and what the global carbon tax means.

[00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.911]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:05:59.071 --> 00:06:03.034]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[00:06:03.334 --> 00:06:04.895]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[00:06:05.195 --> 00:06:11.499]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.

[00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:16.981]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[00:06:17.242 --> 00:06:20.022]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[00:06:20.262 --> 00:06:21.683]  And their formula really works.
[00:06:21.963 --> 00:06:24.524]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[00:06:24.784 --> 00:06:26.024]  Try the NutriCafe.
[00:06:26.284 --> 00:06:30.666]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.

[00:06:38.008 --> 00:06:40.309]  Go to www.innerfood.com
[00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.355]  We're good to go.
[00:06:57.071 --> 00:07:01.273]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:07:01.913 --> 00:07:02.734]  You want answers?
[00:07:03.474 --> 00:07:04.334]  Well, so does he.
[00:07:05.035 --> 00:07:08.636]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:09.217 --> 00:07:13.339]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.262]  He's got a new documentary out.
[00:07:20.282 --> 00:07:24.144]  Global Warming, Emerging Science and Understanding.
[00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:29.182]  We also have another film we carry, Global Warming or Global Government.
[00:07:29.202 --> 00:07:31.845]  You need to show these to your friends and family and neighbors.
[00:07:31.905 --> 00:07:36.349]  First it gets you all hyped up that humans are bad, it's for the earth, we're going to save it.
[00:07:36.929 --> 00:07:40.893]  This is social workers, bureaucracy, feudalism, serfdom.
[00:07:40.913 --> 00:07:46.978]  They want to go to a post-industrial system of total bondage and slavery under environmental crimes.
[00:07:48.366 --> 00:07:55.869]  And it's not toxic waste dumping they're worried about, or open-air planting of cross-species genetic-engineered organisms that could cause a problem.
[00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.911]  It's not about real environmentalism or conservation.
[00:07:59.971 --> 00:08:01.352]  It's about control.
[00:08:02.012 --> 00:08:05.133]  And you can get his new documentary at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:05.394 --> 00:08:09.555]  Dr. Michael Kaufman, so much has happened since we had you on six months ago.
[00:08:09.615 --> 00:08:10.976]  Time just flies.
[00:08:11.016 --> 00:08:13.177]  They passed the total carbon tax takeover.
[00:08:13.617 --> 00:08:14.838]  It was worse than we feared.
[00:08:14.858 --> 00:08:17.099]  They kept the bill secret until after it passed.
[00:08:17.859 --> 00:08:23.242]  Total federalization, home inspections, shutting down selectively, whatever they want.
[00:08:23.982 --> 00:08:29.705]  Every federal agency and sub-agencies with the power to levy carbon taxes arbitrarily.
[00:08:30.405 --> 00:08:34.067]  It seems the new direction in government is just to give dictatorial power to the agency.
[00:08:34.367 --> 00:08:38.189]  They've got gun bills introduced to let the Attorney General ban any guns he wants.
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:47.586]  At his stroke of a pen, if he just states it, that allow him to put anybody on a no-fly list or no-gun-by list, no judge, no jury, no conviction.
[00:08:47.766 --> 00:08:50.048]  It's the same thing with this global carbon system.
[00:08:50.368 --> 00:08:53.991]  They just set up offshore authorities, and then we're ruled by them.
[00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:54.652]  Dr. Kaufman.
[00:08:57.384 --> 00:09:05.908]  Absolutely, because we have no way of actually addressing somebody that's offshore that does not have any accountability to us whatsoever.
[00:09:05.968 --> 00:09:10.070]  And that's why they're doing it, because they want to basically control the U.S.
[00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.530]  economy.
[00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.891]  Remember, we've talked about this on your program before.
[00:09:13.551 --> 00:09:19.655]  For every bit of carbon dioxide that's emitted, it has a corresponding impact on our economy.
[00:09:19.715 --> 00:09:21.276]  It's almost a one-to-one ratio.
[00:09:21.336 --> 00:09:28.641]  So if we reduce our carbon emissions by 20%, we reduce our economy about by 20%.
[00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:31.983]  It's a terrible, terrible thing.
[00:09:32.023 --> 00:09:34.685]  They're trying to get renewable energy to take its place.
[00:09:35.405 --> 00:09:41.112]  But Spain has shown that for every green job created with renewable energy, they lose two and a half jobs.
[00:09:41.572 --> 00:09:45.096]  It costs hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in Spain.
[00:09:45.516 --> 00:09:47.238]  They have 18% unemployment.
[00:09:47.258 --> 00:09:48.520]  They've been doing this for 10 years.
[00:09:50.782 --> 00:09:58.767]  But see, the government then directs the switchover in the economy and the profits only go to a select few, so it vertically integrates.
[00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:01.169]  But they know carbon's not bad, Dr. Kaufman.
[00:10:01.449 --> 00:10:02.870]  They know it's what plants breathe.
[00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:10.135]  That's why they diabolically chose carbon to tax, knowing it's a carbon cycle and we're carbon-based lifeforms.
[00:10:10.746 --> 00:10:11.286]  Absolutely.
[00:10:11.326 --> 00:10:23.273]  And this new DVD that you mentioned, Global Warming and Emerging Science, has new footage in it from the old DVD that clearly, I mean absolutely and positively shows that man cannot be causing global warming.
[00:10:23.293 --> 00:10:34.779]  In fact, a new study was just released yesterday that basically says that all of the carbon dioxide in the last, you know, 600,000 years couldn't be responsible for the warming and the cooling.
[00:10:35.299 --> 00:10:36.860]  There is no correlation whatsoever.
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.301]  It calls into serious doubt.
[00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:40.002]  This is peer-reviewed in Nature Science.
[00:10:40.562 --> 00:10:51.467]  Pure reviewed science that shows that there is really highly questionable evidence now, or strong evidence that questions now the man-caused global warming theory based on carbon dioxide.
[00:10:51.527 --> 00:10:57.790]  So everything is against these people, yet you see in Congress them, major, major push.
[00:10:58.291 --> 00:11:02.553]  How they got it, they introduced the bill on May 15th, it was passed on June 26th,
[00:11:04.511 --> 00:11:07.113]  It's over 1,000, almost 1,500 pages long.
[00:11:07.533 --> 00:11:08.994]  Nobody had a chance to read it.
[00:11:09.014 --> 00:11:13.177]  It's the most expensive bill this country has ever passed.
[00:11:13.697 --> 00:11:14.578]  Nobody ever read it.
[00:11:14.878 --> 00:11:20.362]  It was rammed through Congress, and what it contains will blow your mind.
[00:11:21.143 --> 00:11:27.787]  Basically, everything that you said in introducing this whole subject, Alex, is true, plus a lot.
[00:11:27.947 --> 00:11:30.329]  I mean, you're only touching the surface areas.
[00:11:30.994 --> 00:11:33.738]  It will destroy this nation as we know it now.
[00:11:34.019 --> 00:11:35.981]  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind about it.
[00:11:47.412 --> 00:11:48.072]  Academia.
[00:11:48.373 --> 00:11:50.794]  I mean, you have worked around these phony environmentalists.
[00:11:50.814 --> 00:11:51.614]  You've been around them.
[00:11:52.135 --> 00:11:57.838]  In my experience, the majority, the vast majority of them do believe in neo-eugenics.
[00:11:58.198 --> 00:11:59.959]  They do believe in sterilization.
[00:12:00.339 --> 00:12:02.301]  They do believe in one-child policies.
[00:12:02.661 --> 00:12:07.263]  And now they're openly pushing it, saying babies are bad, they have a bad carbon footprint.
[00:12:07.283 --> 00:12:09.705]  I'm going to show some headlines to people here in a moment.
[00:12:10.425 --> 00:12:17.228]  And really, these are just control freaks who want a managed, collectivist economy, and they're making their move right now.
[00:12:17.248 --> 00:12:28.772]  And now we have the President's Technology Advisor's textbook, 1100 pages, saying forcibly drug the water, have CPS take all the children, have a managed economy.
[00:12:29.052 --> 00:12:31.593]  We wonder why the government seems so out of control and nuts.
[00:12:31.633 --> 00:12:32.353]  They're not nuts.
[00:12:32.753 --> 00:12:34.154]  They know what they're doing.
[00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:36.055]  Well, they're nuts.
[00:12:36.135 --> 00:12:37.256]  They're absolutely insane.
[00:12:37.296 --> 00:12:38.437]  There's no question about that.
[00:12:38.737 --> 00:12:40.238]  But they are doing it deliberately, yes.
[00:12:40.338 --> 00:12:43.241]  There's no question about it for exactly the reasons you're discussing.
[00:12:45.182 --> 00:13:01.976]  In fact, I am literally astonished that anybody in their right mind would even consider doing what is being done right now because there is no justification for it whatsoever other than the political justification of destroying us and rebuilding it in their image under their control.
[00:13:01.996 --> 00:13:02.997]  That's the whole purpose.
[00:13:03.277 --> 00:13:03.998]  They're communists.
[00:13:04.098 --> 00:13:05.980]  I mean, they are scum.
[00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:09.804]  I'm sorry to interrupt, but yes, destroying us, rebuilding us in their image.
[00:13:09.905 --> 00:13:11.326]  It's really happening.
[00:13:11.346 --> 00:13:15.571]  They're taking over healthcare, industries, they're seizing everything.
[00:13:15.631 --> 00:13:22.359]  I mean, they are going to destroy the economy, and the only jobs you're going to get is from them on welfare or through a government contract, doctor.
[00:13:23.155 --> 00:13:24.496]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:13:25.477 --> 00:13:40.530]  The only way we can stop this is to inundate your congressmen and senators, depending on where the bill is at the present time, and tell them to vote no on health care, vote no on cap and trade, vote no on whatever it is, the second stimulus package, whatever it is.
[00:13:41.131 --> 00:13:45.134]  And then back it up by saying, I'm not going to vote for you if you vote yes for these things.
[00:13:45.274 --> 00:13:49.338]  And then start writing letters to the editor with their name in it.
[00:13:50.138 --> 00:13:52.279]  Saying that they are trying to destroy this nation.
[00:13:52.299 --> 00:13:56.640]  Now you've got to be diplomatic because otherwise the paper won't print it.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.101]  But hell, look at NAFTA, look at GATT.
[00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:00.462]  They knew that was going to destroy us.
[00:14:00.722 --> 00:14:04.503]  The UN, the IMF, World Bank said they want a post-industrial.
[00:14:04.783 --> 00:14:15.727]  They've done everything they can to destroy us and now their solution to the crises they created is to throw a wet blanket over an economy that's almost already gone out.
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:16.900]  Absolutely.
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.620]  I totally agree.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:24.761]  They're just fast-tracking it to the destruction of this nation so that they can start rebuilding it.
[00:14:24.962 --> 00:14:28.022]  And we know already they're talking about a single global currency.
[00:14:28.082 --> 00:14:31.843]  You know, you and I have been talking about that for, what, five years now on your program.
[00:14:32.343 --> 00:14:35.563]  And you have probably talked about it many more times than when I was on.
[00:14:36.143 --> 00:14:44.885]  All of these things that we used to talk about, that we were kind of on the superficial fringe of extremism back, as you said, at the beginning of the program five, ten years ago.
[00:14:45.705 --> 00:14:55.931]  Uh, now it's in the daily newspapers and it's always written up in a very positive way, of course, but it's impossible to ignore and not see unless you are so brainwashed.
[00:14:55.971 --> 00:14:59.012]  And that's what our public education system, unfortunately, has done to us.
[00:14:59.653 --> 00:15:04.195]  It's so brainwashed us that we look at this and think, that's a fantastic idea.
[00:15:04.335 --> 00:15:07.777]  And unfortunately, almost half of the nation is in that category.
[00:15:07.917 --> 00:15:09.538]  At least, it certainly seems to be.
[00:15:09.998 --> 00:15:23.772]  Doctor, I don't know if you've looked at this data, but I'm actually working on a new film right now on having a section on this, but mainstream, even AP studies, where they test the major water supplies of the cities, they're finding high levels of
[00:15:25.745 --> 00:15:30.129]  Female hormones that block pregnancy, birth control.
[00:15:30.549 --> 00:15:34.813]  They're finding high levels of Prozac type drugs.
[00:15:35.573 --> 00:15:40.237]  And they're noticing that it's kind of a generic mass molecule.
[00:15:40.737 --> 00:15:43.600]  It's not even the type that people are taking.
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.163]  And they're finding even aquifers that are treated water
[00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:51.736]  Where they take aquifer water and then treat it is having this added.
[00:15:52.517 --> 00:15:54.318]  And they've done British studies as well.
[00:15:54.438 --> 00:15:56.038]  Clearly somebody's adding it.
[00:15:56.138 --> 00:15:57.299]  I've been saying this for years.
[00:15:58.119 --> 00:15:59.440]  And the scientists are saying this.
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:10.345]  Now, and it's so strong, it's sterilizing fish, whales, amphibians, you name it, birds, or they're being unisex, hermaphrodites.
[00:16:11.607 --> 00:16:21.916]  So you study watersheds and forests and all of this, but then we have all these government reports with the Japanese government proposing it and Obama's head of science proposing it.
[00:16:21.936 --> 00:16:29.703]  I mean, do you think there's evidence that they're already testing this out and doing this in some areas?
[00:16:29.743 --> 00:16:38.310]  No, you can't help but believe that they are, at least on a selected basis, if not more uniform across the country, because what we're seeing here is
[00:16:39.595 --> 00:16:57.285]  The eugenics issue, even though I'm not an expert in eugenics, that whole issue of population control, trying to breed for the best person and that type of thing, is literally at the heart of what we're talking about in trying to create the new super person
[00:16:57.765 --> 00:16:58.185]  We're good to go.
[00:17:17.392 --> 00:17:18.193]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:17:39.633 --> 00:17:42.515]  You come to this just coldly looking at the facts.
[00:17:43.256 --> 00:17:44.937]  I don't have any preconceived notions.
[00:17:45.438 --> 00:17:53.584]  But every time I run into these environmental leaders, not their useful idiots on the ground who mean well, when you always talk to them you find out they're into the occult.
[00:17:54.325 --> 00:18:01.851]  Like Dr. Pianca is on the UT website dressed up as a druid talking about Lucifer when he's not talking about how he wants to kill 90% of us.
[00:18:03.032 --> 00:18:04.513]  And I know that sounds crazy.
[00:18:04.573 --> 00:18:05.874]  We're not the ones that are crazy.
[00:18:05.934 --> 00:18:06.595]  They're the ones.
[00:18:06.895 --> 00:18:14.600]  But when you really study the UN, that biological diversity assessment talks about bringing back wars and famine and human sacrifice.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.922]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[00:18:17.342 --> 00:18:24.067]  And then you have the State Department Memorandum 200 saying we'll use wars and pestilence and starvation to do it.
[00:18:24.107 --> 00:18:24.427]  Go ahead.
[00:18:25.439 --> 00:18:26.020]  Absolutely.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:32.545]  I mean, this whole thing with these epidemics and all the rest, you know, some of these things are natural.
[00:18:32.685 --> 00:18:33.906]  I mean, they do happen.
[00:18:34.587 --> 00:18:41.072]  But when you start seeing them on a regular basis, intercoordinated with a lot of other things going on, it's not a coincidence.
[00:18:41.653 --> 00:18:44.695]  They're deliberately doing it for some unknown reason.
[00:18:44.715 --> 00:18:45.876]  Well, we know what the reason is.
[00:18:46.657 --> 00:18:50.640]  They want to gain control, basically reduce the human population to control everything.
[00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:51.201]  Stay there, Doctor.
[00:18:52.247 --> 00:18:58.736]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes.com, the makers of the highest quality vault doors and safes available.

[00:19:52.464 --> 00:19:53.865]  It is a big idea.
[00:19:53.885 --> 00:19:55.985]  A new world order.
[00:19:56.706 --> 00:20:01.027]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:20:04.951 --> 00:20:09.656]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:20:10.397 --> 00:20:17.706]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:20:20.731 --> 00:20:25.694]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:20:26.175 --> 00:20:29.637]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:20:30.057 --> 00:20:32.519]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:20:32.619 --> 00:20:33.760]  Most people have no idea.
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:34.540]  They're not after money.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.641]  They have all the money they need.
[00:20:35.841 --> 00:20:36.562]  They're after power.
[00:20:36.822 --> 00:20:37.682]  That's what happens here.
[00:20:37.963 --> 00:20:42.526]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:20:42.726 --> 00:20:46.248]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:46.688 --> 00:20:49.450]  In Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:50.571]  You have been warned.
[00:20:51.412 --> 00:20:51.872]  Gold.
[00:20:52.233 --> 00:20:53.494]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:20:53.734 --> 00:20:59.860]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.844]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:04.205 --> 00:21:06.086]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:06.147 --> 00:21:08.389]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:08.609 --> 00:21:09.249]  We're good to go.
[00:21:32.517 --> 00:21:32.837]  We're good.
[00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:57.974]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[00:21:58.274 --> 00:22:14.186]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[00:22:14.486 --> 00:22:19.630]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:26.135]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[00:22:26.375 --> 00:22:29.998]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[00:22:30.258 --> 00:22:32.860]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:38.324]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[00:22:38.624 --> 00:22:41.226]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:22:41.307 --> 00:22:43.489]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:45.971]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:50.315]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[00:23:10.784 --> 00:23:17.687]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you study history and other civilizations, the elites, just to exercise power, would routinely say, kill all the firstborn.
[00:23:18.968 --> 00:23:21.049]  Or they'd say, go kill half the slaves.
[00:23:21.629 --> 00:23:23.090]  Gotta keep the slave numbers down.
[00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.170]  Gotta keep them dumbed down.
[00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:26.251]  Gotta keep them on the verge of starvation.
[00:23:26.511 --> 00:23:29.673]  So they're so busy worrying about getting enough to eat, they won't resist you.
[00:23:30.053 --> 00:23:32.154]  This is how elites manage people.
[00:23:33.353 --> 00:23:38.895]  In fact, in the next segment, will you cue up Holdren with that AP clip of him talking about weather control?
[00:23:39.375 --> 00:23:46.657]  That's another issue is, in some of these eugenics reports, they say they'll use wars, famine, and weather.
[00:23:47.237 --> 00:23:52.699]  And then we have Secretary of Defense Cohen, at the time in 97, saying they'd use weather weapons for this.
[00:23:52.719 --> 00:23:55.460]  I can show folks, army.mil, the text.
[00:23:57.694 --> 00:24:02.399]  But now Bill Gates is in the news, in the Associated Press today.
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:07.124]  Bill Gates envisions fighting hurricanes by manipulating the sea.
[00:24:07.865 --> 00:24:11.409]  Well that's exactly what Stanford Research Institute certified a long time ago.
[00:24:11.449 --> 00:24:15.934]  My point is, they're using the shadow government and all these high-tech systems
[00:24:16.574 --> 00:24:34.543]  I believe, Dr. Kaufman, that they're going to create weather calamities as a pretext for creating the Society of Control, because they've studied chicanery and scams of old, and the old witch doctors 6,000 years ago, they would tell the tribe, give me the best food, give me the best hut,
[00:24:35.003 --> 00:24:35.343]  That's right.
[00:24:35.363 --> 00:24:36.564]  I totally agree with you.
[00:24:36.584 --> 00:24:40.247]  There is no question that climate modification and control is very much part of this agenda.
[00:24:59.682 --> 00:25:05.164]  There's been major experiments done on that in Alaska, and we have seen some evidence of that.
[00:25:05.704 --> 00:25:10.146]  You know, it's hard to say for sure exactly how they do it and when they do it.
[00:25:10.566 --> 00:25:17.788]  I'm not a physicist, but I do know that they actually interrupt the ionosphere, and the ionosphere is where our weather is born.
[00:25:17.888 --> 00:25:23.870]  So if they can control what happens there, they basically control our climate to a greater or lesser degree.
[00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:25.491]  It's just one of those things that
[00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:26.511]  Well, every day.
[00:25:42.857 --> 00:25:43.998]  Uh, no exaggeration.
[00:25:44.018 --> 00:25:48.321]  I think today I printed off five or six or so mainstream articles.
[00:25:48.341 --> 00:25:50.763]  Oh, Bill Gates is going to save us from hurricanes.
[00:25:50.803 --> 00:25:53.505]  He just got an idea of cloud seeding.
[00:25:53.565 --> 00:25:54.305]  He invented it.
[00:25:54.425 --> 00:25:55.306]  Oh, he's a genius.
[00:25:55.706 --> 00:26:00.250]  Meanwhile, four years ago, I had the father of weather weapons on the show.
[00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.390]  Yeah, right.
[00:26:26.278 --> 00:26:27.319]  I mean, there's no end to it.
[00:26:27.379 --> 00:26:34.644]  And then all these newspapers and magazines I have say, oh, the global warming is so bad they've got to save us.
[00:26:35.065 --> 00:26:41.229]  And they're going to now smoke screen their weather manipulation, creating the crisis in the name of fixing it.
[00:26:41.509 --> 00:26:47.254]  So while they're creating a crisis, droughts, hurricanes, all this stuff, floods,
[00:26:48.342 --> 00:27:05.479]  They're going to cover their own operation and that they're fixing it and exactly what we said they were doing with the chemtrails with the barium and aluminum dioxide, now that's what they propose in the Wall Street Journal and Atlantic Monthly and other publications and in AP that they're going to do to save us.
[00:27:05.999 --> 00:27:11.640]  How did we just imagine the chemtrails were barium salts and aluminum dioxide with all these climatologists we had on?
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:17.022]  And then Dr. Kaufman, it ends up magically, they go, oh yeah, we've been doing secret test programs.
[00:27:17.422 --> 00:27:21.123]  All this giant global level terraforming was just a test.
[00:27:22.443 --> 00:27:23.263]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:27:23.283 --> 00:27:24.844]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:27:24.924 --> 00:27:33.866]  You know, I talked about the Wildlands Project and what the Convention on Biological Diversity was going to do for five years before it was finally introduced in the U.S.
[00:27:33.926 --> 00:27:34.206]  Senate.
[00:27:34.964 --> 00:27:46.039]  Nobody believed a word I said and here it is now 10 years after the fact or 15 years after the fact now and it's full-blown is doing everything that I said it was going to do back in the late 1980s.
[00:27:47.473 --> 00:28:01.868]  Uh, you and I have both done this, where we have predicted, based on what we've seen, the papers and so forth, of what they're planning behind the scenes, that sooner or later, within 5 to 12 to 15 years, it's going to be mainstream.
[00:28:02.409 --> 00:28:06.273]  And you can't get people to believe it because it wasn't published in the New York Times.
[00:28:08.075 --> 00:28:08.516]  Amazing.
[00:28:08.536 --> 00:28:15.405]  We've got a long segment coming up and I want you to talk about the fact that we can beat this and fight it because you've done that single-handedly before.
[00:28:15.425 --> 00:28:19.390]  You've been doing this for decades and you did warn about the wetlands.
[00:28:19.411 --> 00:28:23.256]  Now we have the Water Quality Restoration Act.
[00:28:23.496 --> 00:28:24.176]  We're on the march.
[00:28:24.196 --> 00:28:24.697]  The empire's on the run.
[00:28:24.717 --> 00:28:26.317]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:28:51.752 --> 00:28:55.735]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:28:55.995 --> 00:28:57.776]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:28:57.996 --> 00:29:06.261]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:29:06.501 --> 00:29:11.745]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:29:12.065 --> 00:29:13.686]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:29:13.926 --> 00:29:20.249]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:29:20.429 --> 00:29:31.194]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:29:31.474 --> 00:29:31.994]  That's right.
[00:29:32.254 --> 00:29:34.555]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:29:34.815 --> 00:29:36.396]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:29:38.337 --> 00:29:38.998]  We're good to go.
[00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:52.751]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:29:53.032 --> 00:29:54.834]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:29:55.034 --> 00:29:55.675]  Well, you should.
[00:29:56.015 --> 00:30:00.280]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:00.981]  That's right.
[00:30:01.321 --> 00:30:09.771]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:30:09.971 --> 00:30:11.232]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:30:11.332 --> 00:30:12.474]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:30:12.674 --> 00:30:18.296]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:30:18.656 --> 00:30:25.179]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:30:25.559 --> 00:30:30.721]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:30:31.061 --> 00:30:32.222]  This is real.
[00:30:32.523 --> 00:30:33.263]  Don't miss out.

[00:30:42.153 --> 00:30:44.315]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[00:30:44.515 --> 00:30:48.019]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[00:30:48.219 --> 00:30:51.122]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[00:30:51.903 --> 00:30:56.885]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:30:57.105 --> 00:31:00.907]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:01.147 --> 00:31:06.730]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:11.892]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:12.112 --> 00:31:18.475]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:31:18.635 --> 00:31:21.596]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here
[00:31:21.596 --> 00:31:21.936]  We're good.
[00:32:18.216 --> 00:32:28.922]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot accuse the establishment of not thinking big.
[00:32:29.463 --> 00:32:35.706]  Terraforming the planet, controlling the weather, and then keeping us like ignorant savages that don't even know what the sun is.
[00:32:37.487 --> 00:32:41.830]  And then Holdren talking about putting up satellites and blocking out the sun and all this craziness.
[00:32:43.089 --> 00:32:46.590]  The point is they want to play God, they want you to live in an engineered society.
[00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:54.112]  There's an article out of a mainstream magazine in the 1940s, We Can Control the Weather, and it describes exactly how they do it.
[00:32:54.772 --> 00:32:57.732]  And there is a massive program of this going on.
[00:32:57.752 --> 00:33:04.234]  This is 1944, and just incredible.
[00:33:04.754 --> 00:33:05.754]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:33:06.054 --> 00:33:07.255]  And it gets into cloud seating.
[00:33:08.195 --> 00:33:08.975]  I want to play
[00:33:11.249 --> 00:33:15.853]  The White House Czar, a clip from the Associated Press.
[00:33:15.893 --> 00:33:18.976]  This is not Alex Jones saying this.
[00:33:19.076 --> 00:33:25.142]  I want to play this clip of John P. Holdren, the eugenicist.
[00:33:25.262 --> 00:33:26.884]  And he is a eugenicist, there's no doubting.
[00:33:27.861 --> 00:33:32.745]  Just like in Endgame, I accused the head of the Human Genome Project of being a eugenicist because I'd read his writings.
[00:33:33.526 --> 00:33:34.967]  No one had ever publicly called him one.
[00:33:35.388 --> 00:33:41.233]  And then a year after Endgame came out, it came out that Mr. Watson said blacks weren't human, were basically subhuman.
[00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:48.034]  And now it's come out they are taking your blood at birth for 36 years illegally for the Human Genome Project.
[00:33:48.114 --> 00:33:49.475]  It's a giant eugenics front.
[00:33:49.955 --> 00:33:56.219]  Sure, they can get some secondary science from it and I think it's fine, but they're using it for race-specific bioweapon development.
[00:33:56.239 --> 00:34:11.730]  We're going to get Dr. Michael Coffin's take on that and some of the things he's been fighting in this Clean Water Restoration Act that federalizes anything that has water above or below ground, puddles of water, and the Rewilding Act and these wilderness corridors on the rivers.
[00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:16.552]  That's all coming up, but here is Holdren to the AP.
[00:34:16.592 --> 00:34:23.975]  And notice on the video in the background by the American flag on the shelf is Ecoscience, the textbook he wrote for government.
[00:34:24.375 --> 00:34:29.137]  A plan of a planetary tyranny to sterilize you.
[00:34:29.417 --> 00:34:29.838]  Here it is.
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:35.522]  We have to look at it very carefully because we might get desperate enough to want to use it.
[00:34:36.342 --> 00:34:40.383]  The danger, of course, with geoengineering is one I was referring to a moment ago.
[00:34:40.423 --> 00:34:58.449]  We don't understand the system well enough to predict its responses in detail, and that means there's always a danger if you try to engineer the system on a large scale, that you will do something that has side effects that are worse than the dimension of the problem you're trying to cure with the geoengineering in the first place.
[00:34:59.729 --> 00:35:03.712]  There are a variety of schemes that have been discussed for geoengineering.
[00:35:03.732 --> 00:35:20.642]  A classic example is injecting reflecting particles into Earth orbit that would deflect some of the sunlight that would otherwise be warming the Earth and in that way try to produce a cooling effect to offset the heating effect of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
[00:35:20.702 --> 00:35:21.683]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:35:22.503 --> 00:35:26.386]  You can watch the rest of the clip up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but understand
[00:35:27.721 --> 00:35:36.106]  For over a decade, we found some government documents about high altitude spraying, these aerosol campaigns, people call them chemtrails.
[00:35:36.166 --> 00:35:42.529]  We got called kooks, and there are some kooks that point at a regular ice trail and say it is a trail when it isn't.
[00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:48.072]  But trails at 2,000 feet don't condensate and sit there and get bigger for five hours.
[00:35:48.733 --> 00:35:52.415]  Real ice trails, real contrails disappear in just a few minutes.
[00:35:53.055 --> 00:35:55.476]  There's a massive program going on, and they admit it!
[00:35:55.937 --> 00:36:06.622]  Now, if you just Google these terms, all these universities, Department of Energy, NASA brags, oh look, the Earth's 20% darker, satellite photos of the whole country covered.
[00:36:07.082 --> 00:36:14.106]  They really are Revenge of the Nerds scientists who happen to be eugenicists on wild power trips, Dr. Michael Kaufman.
[00:36:17.006 --> 00:36:19.147]  Again, there's no question of that.
[00:36:19.167 --> 00:36:20.847]  It's just phenomenal.
[00:36:20.867 --> 00:36:30.950]  When you get back to the chemtrail issues, I'm not an expert on chemtrails, but what I do know is that they're a high enough elevation that they actually form kind of a cirrus cloud formation.
[00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:35.411]  Now, if you know the politics and the science of global warming, man-caused global warming,
[00:36:36.111 --> 00:36:39.694]  This is what they have predicted right from the very beginning.
[00:36:39.714 --> 00:36:42.857]  It's inherited in every single climate model that there is.
[00:36:43.458 --> 00:36:45.439]  It's at about 6 miles in elevation.
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:50.604]  What you'll find is that more cirrus clouds are formed, which trap the heat.
[00:36:51.044 --> 00:36:52.946]  It's a positive feedback mechanism.
[00:36:52.966 --> 00:36:55.368]  I can make it even more complicated than that and you won't understand it.
[00:36:55.868 --> 00:36:57.930]  No, the Earth needs this as its shield.
[00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:00.032]  Go ahead and give people the science.
[00:37:00.894 --> 00:37:08.417]  It basically says that with... Now, first of all, you have to understand that carbon dioxide itself cannot trap much more heat.
[00:37:09.077 --> 00:37:10.498]  Very, very small percentage.
[00:37:10.518 --> 00:37:12.038]  A couple percent, and that's about it.
[00:37:12.438 --> 00:37:18.221]  Because the wavelengths, the wavebands that it traps heat in, are already saturated.
[00:37:18.321 --> 00:37:20.041]  So it cannot do much more.
[00:37:20.101 --> 00:37:28.724]  Therefore, the little that it does do, they claim, are going to create more clouds, more thunderstorms, which when they decay, they create more cirrus clouds.
[00:37:29.125 --> 00:37:29.885]  Cirrus clouds
[00:37:30.465 --> 00:37:37.251]  Trap the heat, low elevation rain clouds reflect the heat, Earth to the Sun, just the opposite of the negative feedback.
[00:37:37.671 --> 00:37:43.996]  In the positive feedback, in cirrus clouds, the radiation emitted by the Earth is trapped again and remitted down.
[00:37:44.196 --> 00:37:49.020]  That means that the upper atmosphere heats faster than the Earth's surface.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:56.226]  And this is well explained in our second DVD, the Emerging Science, Global Warming Emerging Science DVD that Alex now has.
[00:37:57.287 --> 00:37:57.487]  It is
[00:37:58.167 --> 00:37:59.748]  Absolutely night and day.
[00:37:59.828 --> 00:38:08.113]  What the models predict was going to happen the last 40 to 50 years, and what has actually happened, they're not the same at all.
[00:38:08.153 --> 00:38:13.355]  Explain this to me though, because there's other big major films like the great global warming swindle.
[00:38:13.676 --> 00:38:17.678]  They have all these climatologists and scientists and physicists from around the world
[00:38:18.118 --> 00:38:19.239]  Literally the top names.
[00:38:19.579 --> 00:38:23.102]  There's now 37,000 of them have sent a letter and petition to the government.
[00:38:23.403 --> 00:38:24.584]  The government won't even read it.
[00:38:24.764 --> 00:38:26.045]  Won't allow them in testimony.
[00:38:26.505 --> 00:38:32.070]  Only Al Gore who lies and says he invented everything from Kitty Hawk to, you know, to fire.
[00:38:34.412 --> 00:38:35.633]  is the only expert up there.
[00:38:35.853 --> 00:38:39.715]  He openly owns one of the carbon companies and said, what's wrong with me making money?
[00:38:40.035 --> 00:38:50.542]  I mean, it's the outrageousness of this, but also they say it's not just the heat from the sun, it's that different type of nuclei, particles, come into the atmosphere.
[00:38:50.562 --> 00:38:51.583]  Can you explain that?
[00:38:52.034 --> 00:38:59.722]  Yes, there's two and it's explained in much better graphics than it did in the first one in this new Emerging Science DVD.
[00:38:59.802 --> 00:39:06.429]  It really shows very clearly, it's not the total amount of energy that the sun emits, but the kind of energy.
[00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:14.558]  You have incoming cosmic radiation from exposing supernovae from out in the galaxy and so forth that eventually get to Earth.
[00:39:15.265 --> 00:39:30.810]  Those, and it's been shown in experiments now, to be correct, those cosmic radiation particles, when they enter the Earth's surface, or enter the Earth's atmosphere, they start to condense out and ionize and create water droplets.
[00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:41.773]  When they create water droplets, clouds eventually form, and when you have clouds, low elevation clouds, if you've ever flown an airplane above these clouds, it is a bright white.
[00:39:42.113 --> 00:39:44.894]  That's because the sun is reflecting off of those clouds,
[00:39:45.094 --> 00:40:03.405]  Now let me understand, so it's almost like just the space rays, not just the sun's rays, and this whole spectrum of different particles come in like microscopic meteorites and create almost an energy field which then generates the nuclei to allow the raindroplets to form.
[00:40:03.465 --> 00:40:05.847]  So it's a beautiful engine.
[00:40:06.087 --> 00:40:07.027]  It's not a crime.
[00:40:07.447 --> 00:40:09.309]  And carbon dioxide is what plants breathe.
[00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:10.930]  It's not a chemical weapon that'll...
[00:40:12.751 --> 00:40:15.972]  Absolutely.
[00:40:17.533 --> 00:40:23.256]  In fact, we can probably have three to four hundred percent increase in our carbon dioxide and the earth would be much better off for it.
[00:40:23.776 --> 00:40:27.038]  Both plant productivity, food production, and it will not hurt us.
[00:40:27.378 --> 00:40:37.223]  In fact, I've seen those studies that during some of the warming periods with the dinosaurs were the most plentiful that it was many times higher and that the earth was much more tropical.
[00:40:37.867 --> 00:40:38.570]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:40:38.631 --> 00:40:42.507]  Probably about 10 times greater concentration during that period of time.
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:41:00.130]  Uh, and the earth was much more tropical, vegetation was flourishing and abundant, and every time, in fact we have, the science has actually shown that there's been a 12% increase in food production, global food production, because of the increased carbon dioxide we've had the last 50 years.
[00:41:00.511 --> 00:41:09.376]  There's nothing negative about carbon dioxide, it's all positive, but yet they're calling it a pollutant, and because it's a pollutant, then they can control our lives.
[00:41:11.787 --> 00:41:23.570]  I've done the dihydrogen monoxide joke with people at restaurants on the street, and I tend to go out with a camera and do it, because you can say, hey, we need to restrict carbon dioxide, right?
[00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:24.550]  And they go, yes, it's evil.
[00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:26.831]  And I go, what about dihydrogen monoxide?
[00:41:26.871 --> 00:41:27.751]  It's in the water.
[00:41:28.391 --> 00:41:32.432]  And almost every adult, even people in suits downtown, will go, yes, ban it.
[00:41:32.972 --> 00:41:33.632]  It's water.
[00:41:33.812 --> 00:41:38.054]  I assure the viewers, people that support this, that water is not bad.
[00:41:39.054 --> 00:41:39.634]  Absolutely.
[00:41:40.459 --> 00:41:41.639]  You know, it is amazing.
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:47.862]  We have been so sensitized in our educational process that anything chemical is bad for us.
[00:41:47.922 --> 00:41:51.883]  Well, I'm afraid anything that we eat, drink, or otherwise is chemical.
[00:41:52.423 --> 00:42:05.988]  And the fact that we have this aversion to the name chemical is ingrained in us in our educational process, in the television ads, all the rest of it, so that we just recoil away from it.
[00:42:06.649 --> 00:42:07.371]  And we shouldn't.
[00:42:07.511 --> 00:42:11.019]  We have to understand what it is and then treat it accordingly.
[00:42:11.468 --> 00:42:12.809]  What about the brainwashing?
[00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:31.044]  Did you know that there are scores of video games where the zombies are carbon dioxide blobs and the kids shoot them and it's just total brainwashing in the schools and the New York Times reports that kids go home and write mock tickets to their mother because they take a hot bath and the mother goes, I'm glad they're ordering me around.
[00:42:31.465 --> 00:42:33.967]  They're turning us into a total Stasi society.
[00:42:34.207 --> 00:42:38.351]  What about the Green Bill with the home inspections and the federal language about
[00:42:39.172 --> 00:42:44.024]  uh... they can kick you out of your house no judge no jury just i mean this is total tyranny
[00:42:44.637 --> 00:42:51.719]  It is total tyranny, and you and I have, and others, have been warning the people for 15 years or more about this very thing.
[00:42:52.299 --> 00:43:02.681]  It's now right in front of us, and we have a last opportunity to stop it by calling your Congressmen and Senators and saying, no, I'm going to throw you out of office if you vote for these things.
[00:43:03.061 --> 00:43:04.222]  And there's just not one thing.
[00:43:04.262 --> 00:43:05.562]  There's a dozen of them out there.
[00:43:06.142 --> 00:43:10.363]  It would be best if we just shut down Congress and they didn't do anything for four years.
[00:43:10.823 --> 00:43:11.204]  I agree.
[00:43:11.244 --> 00:43:15.328]  Now, for those that don't know, dihydrogen monoxide is the scientific term for water.
[00:43:15.968 --> 00:43:18.731]  And I was just making the point that ask your friends or family.
[00:43:19.592 --> 00:43:21.314]  But put it in a carbon dioxide debate.
[00:43:21.334 --> 00:43:28.021]  Say, for the environment, shouldn't we have a carbon tax on dihydrogen monoxide?
[00:43:28.281 --> 00:43:30.243]  You could also give them the scientific name for salt.
[00:43:30.684 --> 00:43:32.786]  And nine times out of ten, they'll say, ban it.
[00:43:33.883 --> 00:43:34.063]  Right.
[00:43:34.784 --> 00:43:36.385]  Now, you said there's about a dozen.
[00:43:37.066 --> 00:43:51.818]  There's the climate change bill, the carbon tax bills, the Clean Water Restoration Act, there's the rewilding, all these things you warned about, they're now trying to ram through right now because they think Obama's got control of the entire government.
[00:43:52.079 --> 00:43:54.461]  Tell us about some of the things that they're trying to push through.
[00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:59.831]  Well, I think that the water bill, the Clean Water Bill reenactment is really dangerous.
[00:43:59.911 --> 00:44:10.695]  It basically puts, you're talking about our economy with the Clean Cap and Trade legislation, with the water, you're taking control over water, which you need every single day to live.
[00:44:11.495 --> 00:44:18.057]  And if the federal government controls the water of every acre of land in the United States, it controls you and I, period.
[00:44:18.117 --> 00:44:20.818]  I mean, it controls our crop production, it controls everything.
[00:44:21.645 --> 00:44:32.153]  And as a consequence, you look at what these bills do, and every single one of them draws control over a basic thing in our society that we need to have to live.
[00:44:32.794 --> 00:44:36.357]  And once that is done, then the federal government basically controls us.
[00:44:36.837 --> 00:44:38.418]  You have no choice in the matter.
[00:44:38.498 --> 00:44:45.764]  You have to do what they say, just like they did in the old Soviet Union, or you're thrown out of your house, you're prevented from buying food, you name it.
[00:44:46.305 --> 00:44:47.926]  And I'm not saying it's going to happen next year.
[00:44:48.547 --> 00:44:49.948]  But they have that potential.
[00:44:49.988 --> 00:44:52.910]  They have the right to do it now once these laws pass.
[00:44:53.331 --> 00:45:01.617]  And there has been no time in all of history where a bad bill like that has been passed, legislation in the Roman Empire or whatever, that it hasn't been abused.
[00:45:02.281 --> 00:45:10.364]  Well listen, I have the head of City Year, federally funded, these youth brigades in red and black uniforms.
[00:45:10.584 --> 00:45:14.086]  People can Google City Year and watch them doing their chanting and drilling.
[00:45:14.706 --> 00:45:19.828]  And where everything's so bankrupt now, you have to get a job with the government out of high school doing this.
[00:45:20.328 --> 00:45:31.353]  And it says, I have national newscasts saying, they're going to have quasi-governmental groups, mainly young, stupid, ignorant, power-tripping young people,
[00:45:32.233 --> 00:45:42.218]  And it already has shown them on the news that say climate police out shouting people down like Mao Zedong's youth brigades.
[00:45:42.238 --> 00:45:43.919]  Actually that's how they're modeled.
[00:45:44.279 --> 00:45:46.980]  And they even have little blue Obama books that they carry.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:52.583]  And just like in China, I'm not making this up, I have the newscast, waving them as they scream at you.
[00:45:52.963 --> 00:45:55.825]  And already in Austin, if you park an SUV by Barton Springs,
[00:45:56.545 --> 00:45:58.025]  They are slashing tires.
[00:45:58.466 --> 00:45:59.866]  They're out there enforcing.
[00:45:59.886 --> 00:46:03.467]  I mean, folks, I'm not kidding when I say they're already here.
[00:46:03.787 --> 00:46:08.628]  And I have the head of city here saying they're going to use them to enforce on us.
[00:46:09.129 --> 00:46:11.429]  I mean, this is nightmarish, Dr. Kaufman.
[00:46:11.809 --> 00:46:12.149]  It is.
[00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:13.730]  Brownshirts under Hitler.
[00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:17.271]  The Red Brigade in China.
[00:46:17.311 --> 00:46:18.011]  You name it.
[00:46:19.034 --> 00:46:23.438]  We're following the same pattern of all these despots in the past.
[00:46:23.518 --> 00:46:24.498]  Can't we see that?
[00:46:24.519 --> 00:46:27.041]  You know, we have been worrying about it for years.
[00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:32.153]  Decades even, and here it is, it's at our doorstep, and everybody's yawning.
[00:46:32.413 --> 00:46:37.476]  Well, not everybody in this audience, I doubt that, but for the most part, society is yawning.
[00:46:37.676 --> 00:46:40.417]  And I just cannot believe how they could be missing.
[00:46:41.018 --> 00:46:43.739]  You know, everything is going to work out alright, honey, don't worry about it.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:44.800]  It's going to work out.
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.741]  But those people will never do anything like that.
[00:46:47.302 --> 00:46:48.382]  Well, I'm sorry, folks.
[00:46:48.522 --> 00:46:54.586]  History shows that those people will do exactly what we're talking about, given the opportunity, and they are creating that opportunity right now.
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:47:10.547]  Well, they say they're going to wall off all the major NAFTA highways and keep, what, half the... I mean, you've put together the maps off their own documents where half the country's off limits to us, and everywhere they get control, they are rewilding.
[00:47:10.567 --> 00:47:14.048]  They are, all over the West, harassing people off their own property.
[00:47:14.088 --> 00:47:15.589]  I mean, this is going on.
[00:47:16.443 --> 00:47:16.723]  It is.
[00:47:16.863 --> 00:47:17.464]  It really is.
[00:47:17.904 --> 00:47:29.132]  We haven't heard a lot about it in the major urban areas because they have deliberately, basically compartmentalized everything in this country so that we do not hear what's going on in another part of the country.
[00:47:29.632 --> 00:47:34.315]  I go and talk to different groups in different parts of the country and they think that they're the only ones this is happening to.
[00:47:34.675 --> 00:47:36.176]  It's happening to everyone.
[00:47:36.857 --> 00:47:39.278]  And we need to... Our property rights are being destroyed.
[00:47:39.318 --> 00:47:46.183]  You have the Kelo case back in 2005 that basically changed the Fifth Amendment from public use to public purpose.
[00:47:46.723 --> 00:47:49.904]  Well, I've got it here in my folders.
[00:47:49.924 --> 00:47:51.304]  I'm digging around for it right now.
[00:47:51.364 --> 00:47:53.024]  I'll probably find it in the break.
[00:48:16.528 --> 00:48:18.990]  Hundreds of articles a week saying babies are bad.
[00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:20.631]  They have a big carbon footprint.
[00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:23.413]  We need to ban having babies or put taxes on them.
[00:48:23.833 --> 00:48:26.175]  And Australia is actually trying to pass laws.
[00:48:26.475 --> 00:48:29.517]  They're getting rid of the baby credits in California.
[00:48:30.177 --> 00:48:37.182]  They're in women's magazines telling women marriage isn't good, breaking up with your family's good, don't have kids.
[00:48:37.622 --> 00:48:39.664]  I mean, this is a real culture of death.
[00:48:40.084 --> 00:48:41.825]  But humans have a hunger for life.
[00:48:42.305 --> 00:48:44.167]  I think they're going to have trouble implementing this.
[00:48:44.227 --> 00:48:46.028]  I mean, they're in power is what I'm saying.
[00:48:46.608 --> 00:48:51.790]  And it's one thing to pass the laws, it's another thing to be able to actually put this stuff into place.
[00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:54.091]  Yeah, that is very true, and it's amazing.
[00:48:54.631 --> 00:49:03.734]  Last year, maybe 14-15 months ago, 80% of the population here in the United States believed that global warming was generally caused by man.
[00:49:04.814 --> 00:49:06.275]  Maybe they weren't a die-hard believer, but 80%.
[00:49:07.705 --> 00:49:10.486]  That's down to 44% now.
[00:49:10.506 --> 00:49:17.650]  And people are beginning to wake up, and it's been programs like this and others that are starting to really sink home.
[00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:27.914]  When they start to see Obama doing all these things, and they've heard, you know, our crazy comments and so forth over the last few years, all of a sudden they start to see it happening.
[00:49:27.934 --> 00:49:29.455]  They say, oh my gosh, maybe they're right.
[00:49:30.135 --> 00:49:31.976]  You look at the healthcare.
[00:49:32.777 --> 00:49:38.962]  Sixty percent of the American people, two-thirds, do not want to have the present health care in the House of Representatives passed.
[00:49:39.262 --> 00:49:41.964]  And that's when they don't even know how bad it really is.
[00:49:41.985 --> 00:49:43.786]  Dr. Michael Kauffman, stay there.
[00:49:43.806 --> 00:49:45.527]  Let's talk more about this good news, though.
[00:49:45.868 --> 00:49:47.129]  The people are waking up.
[00:49:47.149 --> 00:49:52.953]  That's why the establishment's kind of flipping out now in an orgy of propaganda in an attempt to batter us into control.
[00:49:53.814 --> 00:49:55.615]  It's the world's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:49:55.775 --> 00:49:59.857]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:50:00.037 --> 00:50:11.463]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:50:11.703 --> 00:50:22.189]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[00:50:22.469 --> 00:50:22.989]  I think so.
[00:50:52.728 --> 00:50:58.053]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:50:58.753 --> 00:51:04.118]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:51:04.638 --> 00:51:10.804]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:51:11.124 --> 00:51:12.965]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:51:13.085 --> 00:51:15.487]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:51:15.567 --> 00:51:26.513]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:51:28.754 --> 00:51:30.035]  It's not about left or right.
[00:51:30.435 --> 00:51:31.816]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:51:32.296 --> 00:51:38.520]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:51:47.445 --> 00:51:48.586]  The Obama Deception.
[00:51:49.027 --> 00:51:50.208]  The people strike back!
[00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:56.493]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:51:56.733 --> 00:52:01.615]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:52:01.836 --> 00:52:03.156]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:03.336 --> 00:52:06.818]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:28.071]  No animal testing.

[00:52:29.652 --> 00:52:31.233]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[00:52:31.533 --> 00:52:32.574]  And I save big time.

[00:52:44.381 --> 00:53:06.470]  Folks, I want you to go to InfoWars.com, the online video bookstore, and I want you to get my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, to understand who the Agenesis are, who the Globals are, what their master plan is.
[00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:09.111]  And the new documentary by Dr. Michael Kaufman,
[00:53:10.931 --> 00:53:13.752]  And he's got a great host as well hosting the film.
[00:53:14.313 --> 00:53:17.154]  This will deprogram your neighbors, your friends and family.
[00:53:17.554 --> 00:53:19.235]  This is a life and death situation.
[00:53:19.935 --> 00:53:27.779]  See, the socialists, the communists, the fascists, the command and controllers, the collectivists, they always need a new fraud, a new scam.
[00:53:27.799 --> 00:53:29.579]  That's always how they're saving the world.
[00:53:29.599 --> 00:53:30.200]  That's what they're doing.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:34.522]  When you get to the bottom line, this is the news from the last week of eugenics.
[00:53:35.737 --> 00:53:37.658]  Chinese babies sold for adoption.
[00:53:37.678 --> 00:53:44.321]  If you have more than one child and can't pay the fine, the Chinese government comes and takes your child and sells it to the United States.
[00:53:44.861 --> 00:53:47.082]  That's BBC.
[00:53:47.762 --> 00:53:48.783]  BBC.
[00:53:49.563 --> 00:53:53.125]  Now this is what Obama's Chief of Science has said.
[00:53:53.165 --> 00:53:54.185]  He said, have CPS.
[00:53:55.066 --> 00:53:56.446]  Take everybody's kids, basically.
[00:53:56.506 --> 00:53:58.587]  Everybody gets a government visit to see if you can keep your kids.
[00:53:58.947 --> 00:54:00.908]  Chinese baby girls sold for adoption.
[00:54:01.889 --> 00:54:04.089]  Having large families is an eco-crime.
[00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.970]  Times of London.
[00:54:07.492 --> 00:54:08.753]  Children bad for planet.
[00:54:08.813 --> 00:54:09.815]  News of Australia.
[00:54:12.337 --> 00:54:15.961]  Judge arranges sterilization as part of Charleston woman's probation.
[00:54:17.963 --> 00:54:20.166]  Two children should be limited, says Green Guru.
[00:54:20.766 --> 00:54:23.009]  Study finds high-fructose corn syrup contains mercury.
[00:54:23.069 --> 00:54:23.869]  They do that on purpose.
[00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:24.931]  Washington Post.
[00:54:25.571 --> 00:54:27.714]  Infertility linked to common household chemicals.
[00:54:28.809 --> 00:54:32.310]  Rockefeller Foundation proof where they admit they fund all the eugenics.
[00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:33.210]  Thought I'd show you that.
[00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:36.211]  Baby tax needed to save planet claims experts.
[00:54:36.631 --> 00:54:38.952]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have seven stacks here.
[00:54:39.652 --> 00:54:41.113]  I'll never even get through half of one of these.
[00:54:43.493 --> 00:54:46.954]  OzTV advises CO2 emitting children die early.
[00:54:47.274 --> 00:54:52.456]  This is... I also have the ABC News article where they told kids killing themselves is good.
[00:54:53.649 --> 00:54:56.890]  And then shows pools of blood saying animals die if you don't die.
[00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:59.671]  This is sick, sick, sick!
[00:55:00.071 --> 00:55:05.993]  Remember Al Gore a few months ago telling kids their parents are stupid, don't believe them, global warming's real?
[00:55:07.494 --> 00:55:12.275]  Here's Pelosi, every aspect of our lives must be subject to an inventory under green taxes.
[00:55:14.576 --> 00:55:17.037]  Texas unknowingly donate children's blood to research.
[00:55:17.157 --> 00:55:19.538]  Austin American-Statesman, that's for the eugenics genome.
[00:55:21.496 --> 00:55:23.497]  Kidnappers swoop on China's girls.
[00:55:25.158 --> 00:55:26.239]  Obama's first act.
[00:55:26.339 --> 00:55:28.540]  Taxpayer money to fund abortions of black babies.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:35.124]  If you don't like killing blacks, you don't like blacks.
[00:55:36.324 --> 00:55:39.786]  Here's one where the globalists are happy there's more abortions now that the economy's imploding.
[00:55:41.848 --> 00:55:43.829]  Here's where they knowingly put HIV in the blood.
[00:55:44.844 --> 00:55:46.726]  I'm sorry, Dr. Kaufman, I'm ranting here.
[00:55:46.987 --> 00:55:54.916]  I mean, here's Justice Ginsburg says she originally thought Roe v. Wade was designed to limit populations that we didn't want to have too many of.
[00:55:55.276 --> 00:55:56.858]  Oh, how liberal to kill the blacks!
[00:55:57.459 --> 00:56:01.344]  I mean, why is Margaret Singer worshipped if she said blacks were subhuman?
[00:56:03.362 --> 00:56:04.624]  It's a very good question.
[00:56:05.725 --> 00:56:18.559]  Why does the public seem to put on pedestals both scientists who are lying through their teeth, those nutcases like Singer who have made all these proclamations in the past.
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:22.223]  I'm not talking about Fred Singer, the climate scientist.
[00:56:23.124 --> 00:56:23.805]  I'm talking about
[00:56:25.127 --> 00:56:33.674]  Margaret Singer, yes, who has made all these predictions and has done everything she can to bring to fruition eugenics.
[00:56:34.735 --> 00:56:41.720]  And all the rest of these, it's just like there is, and I think this is really true, there is a great delusion.
[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:43.762]  You know the Bible talks about the great delusion.
[00:56:43.802 --> 00:56:44.402]  This isn't it.
[00:56:44.923 --> 00:56:51.367]  But we're seeing evidence that the whole world can be deluded to a major extent by what we're seeing right now.
[00:56:51.488 --> 00:56:54.390]  I have never witnessed anything like it in my lifetime.
[00:56:55.046 --> 00:57:00.516]  Well, we have offshore banks that have stolen $14.8 trillion, according to Bloomberg, who engineered the crisis.
[00:57:00.876 --> 00:57:04.402]  Now they want another banker bailout that gives them power over the whole economy.
[00:57:04.943 --> 00:57:05.124]  Right.
[00:57:05.919 --> 00:57:09.662]  I mean, but the public's concerned about Michael Jackson being dead.
[00:57:09.702 --> 00:57:11.123]  Dr. Coughlin, one minute break.
[00:57:11.563 --> 00:57:17.047]  I know you've got to leave, but I want to do five more minutes with you to cover a few final topics and talk about the video on the other side.
[00:57:17.607 --> 00:57:21.150]  Then we've got a guest coming on the show, just for a segment or two.
[00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:25.012]  The police say he's not allowed to have an American flag upside down.
[00:57:26.413 --> 00:57:29.876]  They think it's unpatriotic because they're as dumb as a two-by-four.
[00:57:32.248 --> 00:57:37.351]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:57:37.932 --> 00:57:41.334]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:42.054 --> 00:57:43.615]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:57:43.755 --> 00:57:48.378]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever.
[00:57:48.498 --> 00:57:51.240]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:54.322]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:57:54.502 --> 00:58:00.346]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:58:00.566 --> 00:58:03.508]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:58:03.808 --> 00:58:10.713]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:58:10.793 --> 00:58:13.935]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:58:14.075 --> 00:58:15.976]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[00:58:30.588 --> 00:58:31.189]  Take action today.
[00:58:31.229 --> 00:58:33.051]  The first step is getting scorable food.
[00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:46.762]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:58:47.202 --> 00:58:50.144]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:53.686 --> 00:58:57.187]  It's our final segment with Dr. Michael Kaufman.
[00:59:06.926 --> 00:59:09.607]  The entire planet's being issued through an international treaty.
[00:59:09.647 --> 00:59:11.348]  It's ID cards under biometrics.
[00:59:11.368 --> 00:59:13.128]  That'll be the new world currency.
[00:59:13.209 --> 00:59:14.669]  It'll just be a cashless system.
[00:59:14.969 --> 00:59:20.331]  Here's the Times of London, India issues all 1.2 billion citizens with biometric ID cards.
[00:59:21.112 --> 00:59:24.013]  And they say, hey, we've got lots of health care, lots of government help.
[00:59:24.513 --> 00:59:26.434]  Just buy and sell with this card.
[00:59:27.372 --> 00:59:29.573]  And then now they can micromanage society.
[00:59:29.593 --> 00:59:31.894]  Now the social planners can control things.
[00:59:32.374 --> 00:59:34.876]  That's what the environmental movement admits they're about.
[00:59:35.256 --> 00:59:41.699]  Cutting off resources to force the destruction of growth, then to implode society.
[00:59:43.584 --> 00:59:44.945]  to make you become domesticated.
[00:59:45.406 --> 00:59:52.813]  Dr. Michael Kaufman, I wanted to continue to talk about the film Global Warming, Emerging Science and Understanding here in this final segment.
[00:59:53.033 --> 00:59:57.618]  We're carrying this and your other documentary, Global Warming or Global Governance.
[00:59:57.838 --> 01:00:02.642]  Everyone needs to see this, just because our listeners
[01:00:04.076 --> 01:00:05.458]  They know all about this.
[01:00:05.539 --> 01:00:07.742]  Their friends, their family, other school teachers.
[01:00:08.103 --> 01:00:09.164]  People don't know.
[01:00:09.685 --> 01:00:12.770]  And so we need to reach out and educate the public.
[01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:17.658]  Even if they pass these global carbon taxes, we've got to fight it and expose it so we can repeal it.
[01:00:18.019 --> 01:00:18.640]  Dr. Kaufman.
[01:00:19.213 --> 01:00:33.172]  Absolutely, there is no question about that and one of the reasons we did this second DVD was to bring brand new information into the debate as well as format it in a way that you can give to your friends and neighbors in a very easy to understand format.
[01:00:34.233 --> 01:00:36.555]  You can give it to your six school science teachers.
[01:00:36.715 --> 01:00:42.479]  It's designed for classroom showing to combat Al Gore's inconvenient truth.
[01:00:42.999 --> 01:00:45.000]  It's designed to share with other people.
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:54.687]  You can make copies of it, not to sell it, but to make copies to give to your friends and neighbors and to your school teachers and so forth to try to spread this word.
[01:00:54.747 --> 01:01:00.931]  Because once they see this, and it's extremely well done folks, this is Order of Magnitude better than my first
[01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:02.733]  Thank you very much.
[01:01:19.958 --> 01:01:20.618]  Absolutely.
[01:01:20.678 --> 01:01:22.099]  Let me just ask you a side issue.
[01:01:22.159 --> 01:01:26.119]  What feedback have you gotten now two years into Endgame being out?
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:30.620]  Because Endgame is, I think, my best film, my most important film.
[01:01:31.481 --> 01:01:37.642]  Obama Deception is my biggest film because it shatters the left-right paradigm and shows his real agenda, and it covers some eugenics.
[01:01:38.222 --> 01:01:41.423]  But what feedback have you gotten being in Endgame?
[01:01:41.923 --> 01:01:54.033]  Very heavy feedback, Alex, from a lot of people calling to find out exactly, because I'm only on there for maybe five minutes totally, finding out my view on what the whole DVD is about.
[01:01:54.073 --> 01:01:59.116]  And again, I'm not an expert on eugenics, so I have to say basically I know about as much as you do on that issue.
[01:01:59.677 --> 01:02:02.899]  But nonetheless, people are very interested in it.
[01:02:02.979 --> 01:02:09.505]  When I say that it's actually worse than what you portrayed on that, but we can't really say that it's bad enough, what we say on that DVD.
[01:02:11.206 --> 01:02:12.668]  Well, we need to make your new film
[01:02:26.401 --> 01:02:32.804]  Well, I'm going to be really hammering the eugenics issue, the global carbon tax issue, as we try to defeat what's happening in the Senate.
[01:02:47.062 --> 01:02:53.351]  It looks like we may be able to stop it because they were able to hide the bill, 300 pages of it, until it passed.
[01:02:53.852 --> 01:02:58.939]  Now though, it is public and I think it may get beaten, but they're not going to stop there.
[01:02:59.019 --> 01:03:00.462]  So we're definitely in a serious fight.
[01:03:01.038 --> 01:03:20.184]  Yes, we definitely are, and we need to keep the fight up, not only with global warming, that's where I'm focusing right now, my efforts, because you can only do one thing at a time, but this water issue is a crisis, the healthcare issue is a crisis, all of these things, we need to be active, and just call in your Senators and Congressmen and say, no, we're not going to vote for that.
[01:03:20.324 --> 01:03:24.726]  If you do, I'm not going to, I'm going to do everything I can to see that you're not elected again.
[01:03:25.803 --> 01:03:37.072]  And I think I would really encourage some state where they really have an ability to get in there and recall some of their senators and congressmen when they vote for this garbage without even reading it.
[01:03:37.092 --> 01:03:37.673]  Well, I agree.
[01:03:37.733 --> 01:03:40.875]  You know, that ties into the eugenics, the government-run healthcare.
[01:03:41.336 --> 01:03:46.780]  They want to carry their eugenics out against us, including forced abortions, as the White House chief says, science chief.
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:48.481]  Dr. Kaufman, great having you with us.
[01:03:48.982 --> 01:03:50.083]  Thank you for having me back.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:51.560]  We'll talk to you again soon.

[01:04:51.783 --> 01:04:55.766]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:04:56.027 --> 01:04:57.808]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:04:58.028 --> 01:05:06.315]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:05:06.556 --> 01:05:11.780]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:13.722]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:05:13.962 --> 01:05:20.284]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:05:20.464 --> 01:05:31.228]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:05:31.529 --> 01:05:32.029]  That's right.
[01:05:32.289 --> 01:05:34.590]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:05:34.850 --> 01:05:36.430]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[01:05:38.371 --> 01:05:39.012]  We're good to go.
[01:05:52.142 --> 01:05:59.011]  You already know drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:05:59.331 --> 01:06:03.737]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:06:04.017 --> 01:06:08.884]  Alkavision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[01:06:09.204 --> 01:06:16.689]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:06:16.949 --> 01:06:21.211]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[01:06:21.511 --> 01:06:27.455]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:06:27.715 --> 01:06:33.479]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.
[01:06:33.679 --> 01:06:38.962]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[01:06:39.242 --> 01:06:43.046]  That's ALKAVISION.COM or by calling 269-216-9767.
[01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:43.807]  That's 269-216-9767 today!
[01:06:53.570 --> 01:06:59.596]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:00.196 --> 01:07:03.239]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.621]  Vito Congini Jr.
[01:07:05.661 --> 01:07:10.666]  got back from Iraq, as a veteran, thought he'd open a little Italian food restaurant.
[01:07:11.186 --> 01:07:14.529]  They said, yeah, we'll give you the permits, go ahead and do it, we'll give you a liquor license, and they said, no.
[01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:24.981]  So he flew an American flag upside down, which means America's in deep trouble when the socialist bureaucrats control us as slaves so much that we can't even have our own restaurant.
[01:07:26.022 --> 01:07:32.409]  Well, the police came and took the flag, and they said, you don't do that, boy, because in America you lick boots.
[01:07:32.489 --> 01:07:33.571]  That's what this is all about now.
[01:07:34.741 --> 01:07:36.562]  Now, of course, the country is in crisis.
[01:07:36.582 --> 01:07:38.864]  The whole Bill of Rights, whole Constitution's imploding.
[01:07:39.104 --> 01:07:49.392]  The federal government's seizing the big automakers, handing it over to the Chinese and Brazilians and Russians, giving them GM, the big pieces that were operating well, like Hummer and Saturn.
[01:07:50.593 --> 01:07:52.795]  Foreign banks have stolen $14.8 trillion.
[01:07:53.155 --> 01:08:02.262]  But see, to a lot of Americans, patriotism means, if Adolf Hitler put an American flag on his back and returned from the dead, half the public would just kneel.
[01:08:03.638 --> 01:08:14.047]  I mean, if Joseph Stalin teleported in a time machine and was speaking Russian but wearing a suit that had the American flag on it, the public is like under mind control.
[01:08:14.067 --> 01:08:15.768]  They see an American flag, they just kneel.
[01:08:16.549 --> 01:08:21.893]  And so they don't even care if that means the country's in distress and that it's not disrespectful to the flag.
[01:08:22.253 --> 01:08:24.235]  But even if you do something disrespectful, that's your First Amendment.
[01:08:24.856 --> 01:08:27.738]  Because the flag symbolizes that First Amendment and freedom.
[01:08:28.599 --> 01:08:32.242]  And if you don't have the spirit of it and the flag's just red, white, and blue,
[01:08:33.493 --> 01:08:34.914]  So that's why this story is so important.
[01:08:34.934 --> 01:08:44.378]  Here's the local newscast where you can see people trying to pull the flag down, the cops standing by, and then our guest says that the police came and took his flag.
[01:08:45.119 --> 01:08:47.340]  So, uh, this is how they roll.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.421]  Might as well be the Soviet Union.
[01:08:50.881 --> 01:08:51.322]  Here it is.
[01:08:52.342 --> 01:08:56.724]  Flying upside down in crivets to protest a decision made by the village.
[01:08:56.804 --> 01:09:00.286]  Tonight, that symbol is dividing the small community.
[01:09:01.174 --> 01:09:04.035]  NBC26 reporter Rachel Stockman is in with more.
[01:09:04.936 --> 01:09:12.759]  What started off as a question about whether this restaurant could get a liquor license has now turned into a full-fledged village brawl.
[01:09:12.799 --> 01:09:19.341]  And the question now, is this flag a sign of distress and were someone's constitutional rights violated?
[01:09:19.581 --> 01:09:23.443]  It's a flag in distress that some argue is a sign of disgrace.
[01:09:23.703 --> 01:09:27.364]  So upsetting for this man, he came with a knife to cut it down.
[01:09:27.724 --> 01:09:29.165]  Raise the flag properly.
[01:09:31.877 --> 01:09:33.198]  You're violating the law!
[01:09:33.278 --> 01:09:33.618]  I don't care!
[01:09:33.638 --> 01:09:34.379]  You're trespassing!
[01:09:34.459 --> 01:09:34.959]  I don't care!
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:36.561]  You're trespassing!
[01:09:36.801 --> 01:09:38.702]  But it's upside down for a reason.
[01:09:38.722 --> 01:09:42.025]  A reason we'll get to soon, but first... All cops, bring it down.
[01:09:42.625 --> 01:09:49.270]  This is a sign of the deep division in this community that started at Village Hall and Vito Congini's Supper Club.
[01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:51.552]  That'll be the small dining area.
[01:09:51.632 --> 01:09:56.035]  Vito says he can't open the restaurant because the village denied his liquor license.
[01:09:56.488 --> 01:09:58.409]  A license he says he was promised.
[01:09:58.569 --> 01:10:00.771]  We put everything that we owned into this.
[01:10:01.191 --> 01:10:04.573]  We're about $180,000 in debt right now.
[01:10:04.953 --> 01:10:07.595]  So to show his distress, he raised this flag.
[01:10:07.855 --> 01:10:09.376]  I've been to war more than once.
[01:10:09.916 --> 01:10:17.321]  I go over to other countries to fight tyrannical governments from doing whatever they want to their citizens, and then I have to come home and deal with that here?
[01:10:18.061 --> 01:10:18.822]  That's not fair.
[01:10:19.446 --> 01:10:24.233]  It's not right that the American people should have to fear their local government bodies.
[01:10:24.494 --> 01:10:30.323]  But if you ask the man standing on Vito's roof, he'd disagree, and so apparently do the village cops.
[01:10:30.543 --> 01:10:35.010]  I saw the village police, the two full-time officers and two part-time officers,
[01:10:35.876 --> 01:10:39.257]  Stealing my American flag from Vito Pugini's flagpole.
[01:10:39.537 --> 01:10:41.418]  The village would only issue this statement.
[01:10:41.578 --> 01:10:47.980]  The liquor license was denied for economic reasons and due to potential legal action, the board will make no further comment.
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:51.841]  As for this man, Marinette County deputies came and told him to leave.
[01:10:52.161 --> 01:10:54.722]  But that's likely not the end of this dispute.
[01:10:55.182 --> 01:10:58.644]  Vito plans to appeal the village's actions at court.
[01:11:00.606 --> 01:11:03.387]  The rest of it's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:11:03.407 --> 01:11:06.487]  Look, we're going to go to Vito here in just a moment.
[01:11:06.547 --> 01:11:08.408]  I just want to say, this illustrates everything.
[01:11:08.468 --> 01:11:09.428]  This little report.
[01:11:10.108 --> 01:11:12.569]  You've always, in every town, got these empty men.
[01:11:13.749 --> 01:11:16.830]  And they're always saluting the flag and acting real weird.
[01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:19.311]  And if you criticize the government, they say you're not a patriot.
[01:11:19.831 --> 01:11:23.152]  It's patriotic to limit the government, to criticize it.
[01:11:24.572 --> 01:11:26.152]  The government isn't our country.
[01:11:26.232 --> 01:11:26.593]  We are.
[01:11:26.633 --> 01:11:28.053]  The Bill of Rights and Constitution is.
[01:11:30.243 --> 01:11:31.785]  And I have seen similar things.
[01:11:31.825 --> 01:11:35.128]  You know, we sell a t-shirt that has the American flag upside down on it.
[01:11:36.069 --> 01:11:38.231]  And it says, Save the USA.
[01:11:39.131 --> 01:11:39.812]  I mean, the U.S.
[01:11:39.852 --> 01:11:43.175]  is being taken over in a foreign offshore corporate takeover.
[01:11:43.776 --> 01:11:45.337]  And it's got Paul Revere on the front.
[01:11:45.898 --> 01:11:53.044]  Now, according to the DHS report, they say watch out for returning vets, watch out for gun owners, watch out for people that don't like the Federal Reserve.
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:12:00.925]  And if they tell these goons you saw on there that go arrest Americans, it's patriotic, they'll do it!
[01:12:01.185 --> 01:12:01.665]  They're ready!
[01:12:02.566 --> 01:12:06.989]  And they get real emotional over petty, stupid stuff, but then they flip out!
[01:12:08.731 --> 01:12:19.699]  I mean, they'll get upset about the flag or something, not knowing it's a sign of distress, and then violate somebody's property rights and First Amendment, but then they don't care about foreign banks raping us, Bill of Rights on fire, country going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:21.801]  So this story documents it all.
[01:12:22.867 --> 01:12:28.208]  Vito Congeni Jr., who's not even in Wisconsin right now, he's in Illinois looking for work.
[01:12:29.749 --> 01:12:33.610]  And I guess the petty bureaucrats who promised him the license, not gonna get it.
[01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:36.791]  Joining us, thank you for coming on, sir.
[01:12:37.391 --> 01:12:39.272]  Thank you for having me today, I appreciate it.
[01:12:39.852 --> 01:12:41.932]  I don't know how you didn't haul off and punch that guy.
[01:12:41.952 --> 01:12:47.694]  He's on your property, trying to take your property, and he's just out of his mind.
[01:12:49.313 --> 01:12:50.635]  I mean, is that guy all there?
[01:12:50.655 --> 01:13:00.484]  I mean, he's up there saluting the flag like he just saved America from Al-Qaeda and he's on a property owner's, a veteran's own property, trying to steal his property?
[01:13:01.105 --> 01:13:04.849]  I think he had a few too many this morning, that morning that that had happened.
[01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:13.037]  The problem with it is he lets people tell him what he should think and what he should know instead of thinking and reading for himself.
[01:13:15.459 --> 01:13:21.162]  He actually thought that I was being disrespectful to the flag and that is not a sign of disrespect.
[01:13:21.282 --> 01:13:22.682]  It is a sign of distress.
[01:13:23.323 --> 01:13:29.666]  I have no intention nor would I ever disrespect the United States flag or this great country.
[01:13:30.866 --> 01:13:34.328]  We need to stand up and take our freedoms and
[01:13:34.724 --> 01:13:38.245]  Stop taking them for granted and realize you have to be willing to fight for it.
[01:13:38.365 --> 01:13:39.865]  I've been to a few wars here.
[01:13:40.506 --> 01:13:43.206]  I know what it's like for people not to have a freedom.
[01:13:43.546 --> 01:13:48.228]  Believe me, I'm going to fight tooth and nail until my dying breath to keep my freedoms.
[01:13:48.748 --> 01:13:51.489]  And freedom of speech is one of the most important ones we have.
[01:13:52.029 --> 01:13:58.490]  And if they don't think that that First Amendment is so important to them, they better realize the other items that are mentioned in that First Amendment.
[01:13:58.570 --> 01:14:04.032]  Your freedom of choice of religion and your freedom of choice to question your government in a peaceful,
[01:14:05.442 --> 01:14:06.584]  Ensemble of people.
[01:14:07.465 --> 01:14:09.388]  And the freedom of the press, let's not forget that.
[01:14:11.249 --> 01:14:14.251]  And the freedom of the right to assembly, as you said.
[01:14:14.892 --> 01:14:18.455]  So, obviously that newscast is just a short snapshot.
[01:14:18.795 --> 01:14:19.836]  How did all this begin?
[01:14:19.916 --> 01:14:20.977]  What's really going on?
[01:14:21.397 --> 01:14:24.560]  What's your neighbor saying he sees the police taking your flag?
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:32.526]  I mean, are they really that stupid that they don't understand it's your First Amendment right and it's a sign of I'm in trouble, help me?
[01:14:32.866 --> 01:14:37.190]  That it would be disrespectful to fly that flag right side up if the...
[01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:42.513]  If the country is in crisis, you're supposed to use the flag as a communication tool.
[01:14:43.133 --> 01:14:43.794]  Absolutely.
[01:14:44.254 --> 01:14:47.216]  Well, the problem was, it even gets worse.
[01:14:47.696 --> 01:14:59.244]  Not only did the police come to my place of business on the 4th of July on my private property with no warning, no warrant, but the district attorney from Marinette County instructed them to do so.
[01:14:59.844 --> 01:15:05.428]  Since then, he has actually gone on national TV and said, I know I was doing wrong, but I did it anyway.
[01:15:05.888 --> 01:15:14.153]  Now here's somebody who's supposed to know the law, an educated man of the law, and he decided to openly violate the law himself.
[01:15:15.114 --> 01:15:16.574]  And who's going to prosecute him?
[01:15:16.815 --> 01:15:17.215]  Nobody.
[01:15:21.377 --> 01:15:26.921]  Are they that ignorant that they don't know that flying the flag upside down means distress?
[01:15:27.876 --> 01:15:29.257]  I have explained it to them.
[01:15:29.477 --> 01:15:37.582]  We've actually hung signs on my building to explain this to them, what these signs with Union side down, what it means.
[01:15:38.103 --> 01:15:40.224]  That way people can understand it that don't.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:42.981]  I don't know what more I can do.
[01:15:43.121 --> 01:15:44.082]  I've been out there.
[01:15:44.142 --> 01:15:45.603]  I've talked to these people.
[01:15:45.763 --> 01:15:47.304]  I read the U.S.
[01:15:47.384 --> 01:15:48.405]  flag code to them.
[01:15:48.905 --> 01:15:58.933]  They just get told that by somebody that, oh, he must be meaning disrespect, and they go off on their little tangent and believe it instead of listening to my side of it.
[01:15:59.513 --> 01:16:01.274]  But we did have a small, uh,
[01:16:03.271 --> 01:16:16.240]  There's a group of people that came to show their displeasure in what I'm doing, and about 10 out of those 25 people changed their mind after they were told why the flag was being flown in distress.
[01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:18.982]  But the other 15 are complete morons.
[01:16:19.022 --> 01:16:22.605]  They're complete... Look, the thing is, America's going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:25.767]  They know it, and they don't like seeing a reminder of it.
[01:16:26.147 --> 01:16:28.109]  They just want America to be euthanized.
[01:16:29.056 --> 01:16:37.679]  Put to sleep, lethal injection, quietly, and they want to wrap themselves in the flag and climb into a grave and, you know, put up with that.
[01:16:37.699 --> 01:16:39.819]  Well, they want to bury their heads in the sand.
[01:16:40.439 --> 01:16:43.200]  They're trying to play the ostrich effect, and you can't do that.
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:47.161]  You have to be willing to fight for your freedoms, just like they did in 1776.
[01:16:47.261 --> 01:16:50.102]  Oh, this is just ridiculous.
[01:16:50.142 --> 01:16:55.764]  This is ridiculous that they ninny around and get so upset about this, and even when you explain to them
[01:16:56.764 --> 01:17:01.526]  The law, they just deny it because it feels so good to ninny around.
[01:17:02.246 --> 01:17:04.007]  Now, now, now, how did this begin?
[01:17:04.748 --> 01:17:10.030]  Why won't this little area give you the license to sell beer?
[01:17:11.036 --> 01:17:14.780]  I actually went to them prior to purchasing the building and told them what I wanted.
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.241]  They approved of everything.
[01:17:16.281 --> 01:17:17.743]  They said, yes, we like this idea.
[01:17:17.763 --> 01:17:19.164]  It would be wonderful for the town.
[01:17:19.624 --> 01:17:23.448]  Then I went to them on January 20th and said, I'm ready for it.
[01:17:23.468 --> 01:17:24.309]  I'll open February 1.
[01:17:24.529 --> 01:17:25.250]  They said, no.
[01:17:25.650 --> 01:17:30.015]  It would be too much competition for the other people in town and your location.
[01:17:30.275 --> 01:17:32.257]  They tried to say it was too close to a school.
[01:17:32.697 --> 01:17:34.299]  The local ordinance for that is
[01:17:35.109 --> 01:17:35.709]  300 feet.
[01:17:35.929 --> 01:17:39.111]  I'm almost a thousand feet away from that school.
[01:17:39.191 --> 01:17:40.911]  So I met every requirement.
[01:17:41.271 --> 01:17:44.893]  Plus there are four other reasons that they can deny you a license.
[01:17:45.173 --> 01:17:50.094]  I met and surpassed every one of those reasons and I showed that to them and they still used it.
[01:17:50.475 --> 01:17:53.936]  The one that gets me the most is that I would be too much competition.
[01:17:54.296 --> 01:17:57.797]  How can you say that you can deny competition in the United States?
[01:17:58.377 --> 01:18:00.278]  How can you feel that you have that authority?
[01:18:01.299 --> 01:18:02.599]  That's what makes this country great.
[01:18:03.715 --> 01:18:05.576]  How can Obama take over GM?
[01:18:05.596 --> 01:18:09.837]  I mean, they're little social planners as if they're God.
[01:18:10.477 --> 01:18:11.077]  Exactly.
[01:18:11.097 --> 01:18:11.777]  You can't do that.
[01:18:11.817 --> 01:18:15.138]  You can't allow the government to tell you how you're supposed to live.
[01:18:15.418 --> 01:18:23.800]  That's like if you're more handsome and you get the beauty queen, they come up and say, we're going to cut your nose off so that you're not too handsome so there's no competition.
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:25.481]  I mean, that's where all this ends.
[01:18:27.305 --> 01:18:28.606]  It can go a lot further.
[01:18:28.626 --> 01:18:31.309]  It could be, oh, you're the wrong color or you're the wrong race.
[01:18:31.789 --> 01:18:33.691]  We're not going to let you come up here.
[01:18:35.793 --> 01:18:39.997]  Well, we know why.
[01:18:40.698 --> 01:18:46.324]  They're just a bunch of control freaks and I'm sure some other restaurant or something gave them a little bit of money on the side.
[01:18:48.626 --> 01:18:50.287]  Let's come back and talk about where this is going.
[01:18:58.593 --> 01:19:09.620]  Aerial spring, chemtrails, the modified atmosphere, heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.842]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[01:19:13.422 --> 01:19:18.866]  Detoxify with micro plant powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[01:19:23.112 --> 01:19:27.373]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[01:19:27.833 --> 01:19:31.014]  Protect your family now with micro plant powder.
[01:19:31.714 --> 01:19:35.054]  Cleaning out heavy metals, parasites and toxins.
[01:19:35.595 --> 01:19:40.236]  Order it now for daily intake and stock it now for long term storage.
[01:19:40.756 --> 01:19:44.036]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 today!
[01:19:52.825 --> 01:19:58.150]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:19:58.850 --> 01:20:04.195]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:20:04.735 --> 01:20:10.901]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:20:11.221 --> 01:20:13.063]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:20:13.203 --> 01:20:15.585]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:20:15.665 --> 01:20:26.613]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:20:28.855 --> 01:20:30.136]  It's not about left or right.
[01:20:30.536 --> 01:20:31.918]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:20:32.378 --> 01:20:38.623]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:20:39.275 --> 01:20:47.046]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:20:47.547 --> 01:20:48.688]  The Obama Deception.
[01:20:49.129 --> 01:20:50.331]  The people strike back!
[01:20:51.917 --> 01:20:58.123]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:20:58.584 --> 01:21:06.372]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:06.712 --> 01:21:12.298]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[01:21:12.618 --> 01:21:14.559]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[01:21:14.859 --> 01:21:19.621]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:19.961 --> 01:21:24.662]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:25.183 --> 01:21:29.024]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:29.524 --> 01:21:30.544]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:30.624 --> 01:21:34.646]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:21:35.106 --> 01:21:39.491]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:21:40.011 --> 01:21:42.574]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:21:43.014 --> 01:21:44.656]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:44.796 --> 01:21:45.016]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.065 --> 01:21:54.647]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:21:55.067 --> 01:22:00.031]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:22:00.411 --> 01:22:02.132]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:22:02.452 --> 01:22:06.075]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is
[01:22:08.902 --> 01:22:09.983]  We don't know.
[01:22:33.664 --> 01:22:34.405]  All you can get.
[01:22:34.605 --> 01:22:35.445]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:22:35.706 --> 01:22:38.448]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:22:38.748 --> 01:22:39.108]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:22:39.268 --> 01:22:40.509]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:22:40.529 --> 01:22:41.450]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:23:00.043 --> 01:23:01.745]  Vito Congeni Jr.
[01:23:01.805 --> 01:23:02.425]  is our guest.
[01:23:02.545 --> 01:23:06.749]  I got a really exciting letter here I want to read when we come back from break.
[01:23:07.210 --> 01:23:17.899]  And I want to remind my staff and myself I want to implement a time on the show every day for like 10-15 minutes where I read quick email questions and answer them and then read a letter or two of the day.
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:26.267]  We get thousands of letters a week no exaggeration and I we try to scan through them and read and I I want to try to
[01:23:27.631 --> 01:23:30.275]  Give the attention due to some of these great points people are making.
[01:23:30.295 --> 01:23:33.961]  We're going to try to more heavily program the show by programming.
[01:23:34.021 --> 01:23:43.475]  Set up what we do, when we do, how we cover it because there's so much to get to and time has a way of getting away from us but we try to give people a full spectrum breakdown of what's happening.
[01:23:44.983 --> 01:23:48.725]  Man, this story of what happened to you in Wisconsin just illustrates so much.
[01:23:48.765 --> 01:23:52.207]  And you're saying your family is sunk into debt to do this.
[01:23:52.748 --> 01:23:54.048]  They won't even let you open.
[01:23:54.089 --> 01:23:56.170]  You gotta have wine in an Italian restaurant.
[01:23:56.890 --> 01:23:59.692]  I mean, that's just, you know, that goes like a horse and carriage.
[01:23:59.732 --> 01:24:04.995]  I wouldn't go to an Italian restaurant, at least back when I was drinking, you know, occasionally without red wine.
[01:24:05.415 --> 01:24:06.656]  I mean, that's something you gotta have.
[01:24:07.417 --> 01:24:08.637]  And they just don't care.
[01:24:08.677 --> 01:24:10.038]  I mean, you've gotta sue them.
[01:24:10.078 --> 01:24:12.800]  That's pure discrimination that they said to you.
[01:24:14.164 --> 01:24:18.205]  And I would call him again and record him saying at this time that, oh, that would be competition.
[01:24:18.485 --> 01:24:22.427]  I mean, are they like the gods, the fairy godmother that waves their wand?
[01:24:22.787 --> 01:24:24.387]  Well, that's what licensing does.
[01:24:24.788 --> 01:24:25.948]  It turns us into slaves.
[01:24:27.549 --> 01:24:28.229]  Yes, it does.
[01:24:28.489 --> 01:24:30.610]  And as you said, I need to sue them.
[01:24:30.650 --> 01:24:39.673]  But unfortunately, you can't really find an attorney who's trying to, you know, feed his family to sue a municipality because they're worried about people not coming in and
[01:24:41.363 --> 01:24:45.065]  Using them as attorneys, they just don't want to fight the municipality.
[01:24:45.406 --> 01:24:47.927]  They don't want to try to get a bad name themselves in the town.
[01:24:49.588 --> 01:24:57.293]  That's when the ACLU found out about the violation of my First Amendment rights, and now they're considering taking it on.
[01:24:57.333 --> 01:25:00.895]  They haven't agreed to do so yet, but they are taking it under consideration.
[01:25:01.502 --> 01:25:06.723]  Well, why don't these local boss hogs on power trips just apologize?
[01:25:06.743 --> 01:25:08.143]  I mean, they're obviously boss hogs.
[01:25:08.443 --> 01:25:10.644]  Did the police come and steal the flag?
[01:25:10.704 --> 01:25:14.925]  I mean, or are they just ignorant?
[01:25:15.765 --> 01:25:25.207]  They actually came on my property, no warrant, no warning, no phone call, nothing, and literally went there, took the flag down from the pole, and left with it.
[01:25:25.247 --> 01:25:31.208]  And when my neighbor saw what they were doing, he tried to stop them, and they threatened him with arrest if he tried to interfere.
[01:25:32.745 --> 01:25:41.376]  Now there was a case in Reno, Nevada, where they were flying a Mexican flag above an American flag, and the guy went and cut it down and got in trouble.
[01:25:41.416 --> 01:25:42.157]  We had him on.
[01:25:42.558 --> 01:25:43.759]  But I guess that's okay.
[01:25:44.019 --> 01:25:46.042]  Just don't fly the American flag upside down.
[01:25:46.082 --> 01:25:48.986]  I guess if you would have urinated on it or something, they would have been happy.
[01:25:50.435 --> 01:25:52.337]  Actually, that's part of the U.S.
[01:25:52.757 --> 01:25:55.019]  flag code, and I am following the U.S.
[01:25:55.059 --> 01:25:55.579]  flag code.
[01:25:55.599 --> 01:26:03.666]  If you defecate or spit on the flag, that is illegal, but if you hang it upside down, union side down, that is part of the U.S.
[01:26:03.726 --> 01:26:04.286]  flag code.
[01:26:04.406 --> 01:26:05.728]  It's a signal of distress.
[01:26:05.808 --> 01:26:07.409]  It is not a sign of disrespect.
[01:26:07.869 --> 01:26:08.370]  No, I know.
[01:26:08.410 --> 01:26:09.690]  These people are just morons.
[01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:19.396]  Are they starting to get embarrassed that the national media is covering the fact that it's a sign of distress and your right to do it?
[01:26:19.436 --> 01:26:23.539]  Or are they just sticking their thumbs in their mouths and sucking them and saying, I don't care?
[01:26:24.359 --> 01:26:30.363]  Well, you know, it's hard to say because their village attorney that's attended the meeting for the licensing and everything,
[01:26:31.018 --> 01:26:35.362]  They asked them, they asked their attorney, can we deny him for this reason?
[01:26:35.422 --> 01:26:44.770]  And he told them straight out, well if you deny him for that reason, he's going to have the ability to come back at you and sue you and appeal it at the circuit court level.
[01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:50.074]  And even though he basically told them you can't do it for that reason, they did it anyway.
[01:26:50.455 --> 01:26:51.976]  Why are they out to get you?
[01:26:52.576 --> 01:26:54.598]  I mean, are you an outsider?
[01:26:54.618 --> 01:26:58.682]  I mean, is this a boss hog situation where everybody's married to their mother?
[01:26:59.292 --> 01:26:59.792]  Pretty much.
[01:27:00.152 --> 01:27:00.652]  Pretty much.
[01:27:01.292 --> 01:27:03.813]  Uh, I moved up there in 1995.
[01:27:04.473 --> 01:27:05.393]  I bought my house.
[01:27:05.653 --> 01:27:11.094]  I bought a business in 2004 there, which was just a bar cavern with a small amount of food.
[01:27:11.474 --> 01:27:15.635]  And then when I got activated for a rack, I sold out to my partner and I went to a rack.
[01:27:15.675 --> 01:27:18.456]  And then when I came back, I started looking for another one.
[01:27:18.516 --> 01:27:20.636]  It took me a couple of years and now I just found it.
[01:27:21.196 --> 01:27:23.657]  And now I went to them and they said, yes, we will give it to you.
[01:27:23.897 --> 01:27:28.338]  And when I go to them to get the final approval for the license so I can open my doors, they said no.
[01:27:31.533 --> 01:27:32.993]  That is just devastating.
[01:27:33.254 --> 01:27:36.354]  And of course they won't give you the liquor license until after you've already built it.
[01:27:36.374 --> 01:27:37.615]  That's how it works most places.
[01:27:37.895 --> 01:27:38.355]  Exactly.
[01:27:38.935 --> 01:27:40.416]  So where are you going from here?
[01:27:40.496 --> 01:27:43.177]  Are you going to leave the state?
[01:27:43.777 --> 01:27:44.437]  Bankruptcy.
[01:27:45.937 --> 01:27:47.478]  Find another place to live.
[01:27:47.718 --> 01:27:52.880]  Hopefully they won't throw me, myself and my wife and my family out of our house on the street.
[01:27:54.818 --> 01:28:01.305]  I'm paying about $9,700 a month in bills, and that was fine until I lost my job as an electrician in Illinois.
[01:28:01.765 --> 01:28:06.470]  And now I come down here looking for work pretty much every week, and it hasn't been so good.
[01:28:07.071 --> 01:28:08.592]  I'll get a week, maybe a month.
[01:28:08.813 --> 01:28:13.437]  And then meanwhile, the crazy town won't let you supply the service of an Italian restaurant.
[01:28:13.637 --> 01:28:13.738]  No.
[01:28:14.158 --> 01:28:14.398]  No.
[01:28:14.518 --> 01:28:21.123]  Do you have a website or an email for folks to contact you that might want to legally help you?
[01:28:21.523 --> 01:28:23.144]  I am listed on Facebook.
[01:28:23.364 --> 01:28:26.266]  I am getting thousands of people giving me their support.
[01:28:26.306 --> 01:28:28.608]  I want to say thank you to all of them for their support.
[01:28:29.028 --> 01:28:30.970]  And for those that aren't supporting me,
[01:28:31.877 --> 01:28:33.138]  Where's your First Amendment right?
[01:28:33.518 --> 01:28:35.060]  That's all I'm saying this is about.
[01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:37.942]  This is about using that First Amendment right.
[01:28:38.082 --> 01:28:38.723]  I agree with you.
[01:28:38.743 --> 01:28:41.385]  Vito, we'll talk to you again as this unfolds.
[01:28:41.425 --> 01:28:41.986]  God bless you.
[01:28:42.006 --> 01:28:42.166]  Alright.
[01:28:42.426 --> 01:28:42.887]  Thank you.
[01:28:42.907 --> 01:28:43.367]  Take care.
[01:28:43.427 --> 01:28:44.328]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.828 --> 01:28:46.430]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:50.033]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:51.874 --> 01:28:57.417]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[01:28:57.717 --> 01:28:58.878]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:28:59.018 --> 01:29:01.820]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around.
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.000]  They're called Inner Food.
[01:29:03.301 --> 01:29:04.842]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:29:05.162 --> 01:29:11.445]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[01:29:12.586 --> 01:29:15.147]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[01:29:15.467 --> 01:29:16.947]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[01:29:17.207 --> 01:29:19.988]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[01:29:20.208 --> 01:29:21.648]  And their formula really works.
[01:29:21.928 --> 01:29:24.489]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:29:24.749 --> 01:29:25.989]  Try the Nutri-Cafe.
[01:29:26.229 --> 01:29:30.650]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[01:29:31.010 --> 01:29:33.190]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:35.691]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:29:35.871 --> 01:29:37.631]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:29:37.971 --> 01:29:39.092]  Go to www.
[01:29:40.692 --> 01:29:43.298]  We're good to go.
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:56.943]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:29:57.163 --> 01:30:00.945]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:01.185 --> 01:30:06.789]  Number two, our new Energy Czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:07.089 --> 01:30:11.951]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:12.152 --> 01:30:12.612]  Number three,
[01:30:13.072 --> 01:30:18.515]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:30:19.355 --> 01:30:22.016]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:30:22.256 --> 01:30:25.678]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:26.778 --> 01:30:30.380]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:36.104]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:30:36.344 --> 01:30:40.928]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:30:51.971 --> 01:30:54.393]  Know that you can be tracked and traced when you're online?
[01:30:54.653 --> 01:31:02.539]  With identity theft and cybercrimes on the rise, your passwords, your identity, and even your physical location can be revealed to complete strangers.
[01:31:02.779 --> 01:31:06.462]  Would you like to surf the internet anonymously and not have to worry about these threats?
[01:31:06.722 --> 01:31:09.725]  Well, now you can by visiting patriotinternet.com.
[01:31:09.885 --> 01:31:15.349]  For about $2 per month, patriotinternet.com will conceal your IP address and your physical location.
[01:31:15.589 --> 01:31:15.969]  All right.
[01:31:37.722 --> 01:31:37.982]  We're good.
[01:31:57.284 --> 01:32:17.274]  Look, I don't care if you're black, white, hispanic, asian, a cop, a fireman, a school teacher, a nuclear physicist, a dentist, somebody who bags groceries.
[01:32:17.994 --> 01:32:22.857]  If you love liberty and freedom and will stay out of my life, I'll stay out of your life.
[01:32:24.756 --> 01:32:29.120]  But, when people have authority and abuse it, they become the number one enemy.
[01:32:30.281 --> 01:32:31.842]  And I'm with the Founding Fathers on that.
[01:32:32.282 --> 01:32:36.966]  If you want to go along with these offshore banks and all these chicken-neck criminals, then just go right ahead.
[01:32:37.006 --> 01:32:41.930]  And I tend to get mad at police at a primitive level, because I'm threatened by them.
[01:32:42.170 --> 01:32:49.476]  Just like at a primitive level, if somebody's got a pit bull walking down the street and kind of starts smiling and doing it towards me, I get threatened and I want to attack them.
[01:32:51.318 --> 01:32:52.499]  It's an instinct thing.
[01:32:53.962 --> 01:33:02.188]  And I know I go over the deep end all the time, and I try to not sit here and play the cop bashing videos constantly, and believe me folks, there's plenty of ammo.
[01:33:03.969 --> 01:33:18.479]  But when they're choking some ambulance driver for no reason, and then we get the squad car video, and the ambulance didn't even block them, and the cop drove up on them at 100 miles an hour, and then acts like a nut, and then lies about it, that's a big issue.
[01:33:18.819 --> 01:33:23.002]  And when the police defend that state trooper, that's the bigger problem.
[01:33:23.939 --> 01:33:29.201]  Because there's corrupt people in power that want to promote bad people and protect bad people.
[01:33:30.021 --> 01:33:32.662]  But that said, there are a lot of police and military waking up.
[01:33:32.682 --> 01:33:40.744]  And they sent us a lot of documents, a lot of material, a lot of information, like the MIAC report and the DHS report and all these other big reports.
[01:33:45.585 --> 01:33:47.846]  People then say, well tell us their names on air, prove it.
[01:33:48.486 --> 01:33:49.666]  I don't give up my sources.
[01:33:50.387 --> 01:33:51.427]  You want to get them in trouble.
[01:33:53.971 --> 01:33:58.195]  The proof of my sources is it comes out that these stories are real.
[01:34:00.177 --> 01:34:03.900]  People are so ignorant, like reporters aren't supposed to have sources and you're supposed to give them up.
[01:34:05.462 --> 01:34:12.168]  The issue is I have a love-hate relationship with the police and the military because I have a lot of family that are military, some that are police, they're good people.
[01:34:13.268 --> 01:34:16.049]  You know, Bob Dacey's son's a cop, you know, he's nice.
[01:34:16.749 --> 01:34:24.991]  I know there are a lot of good police, but there are a lot of bad ones, and when they do bad things, they get defended and protected, because the system is corrupt and is evil.
[01:34:25.231 --> 01:34:26.011]  And that's a fact.
[01:34:26.431 --> 01:34:29.152]  But I get letters like this every day, so I thought I'd read this one.
[01:34:30.032 --> 01:34:34.353]  And I talk to people who travel around the country and the world, and they see the same thing.
[01:34:36.604 --> 01:34:39.326]  In fact, it isn't just people getting arrested with anti-U.N.
[01:34:39.346 --> 01:34:41.808]  stickers, it's people getting let go that have anti-U.N.
[01:34:41.828 --> 01:34:42.128]  stickers.
[01:34:42.808 --> 01:34:48.593]  How about we don't arrest people that have anti-U.N.
[01:34:48.613 --> 01:34:51.715]  stickers as their First Amendment, and how about people that have anti-U.N.
[01:34:51.735 --> 01:34:53.256]  stickers don't get special treatment?
[01:34:53.776 --> 01:34:56.718]  Because, see, once you start down that road, that's the road to tyranny.
[01:34:57.019 --> 01:34:58.319]  That's another form of tyranny.
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:04.264]  But here is a letter I got to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:35:05.458 --> 01:35:07.558]  From John in Tampa Bay, Florida.
[01:35:07.699 --> 01:35:09.819]  Activity report for your encouragement.
[01:35:10.879 --> 01:35:13.480]  Just to let you know what is happening in Tampa Bay.
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:22.422]  On the 4th of July holiday I was able to get about 240 Obama deception videos at events that day including the Tea Party on a major roadway.
[01:35:23.082 --> 01:35:25.563]  Cars at the intersection got the most DVDs.
[01:35:26.043 --> 01:35:27.663]  Also a fireworks event was hit.
[01:35:27.683 --> 01:35:30.384]  I like that term, hit.
[01:35:30.504 --> 01:35:31.364]  We are, we're hitting
[01:35:32.844 --> 01:35:33.845]  The enemy operations.
[01:35:33.885 --> 01:35:35.106]  We're unlocking mines.
[01:35:35.126 --> 01:35:38.548]  You've got this propaganda grid by the globalists and we're hitting it.
[01:35:39.749 --> 01:35:41.291]  These are guerrilla attacks, folks.
[01:35:41.651 --> 01:35:43.132]  We are savaging them.
[01:35:43.192 --> 01:35:44.373]  We're having great effects.
[01:35:48.216 --> 01:35:52.079]  At the fireworks event at the City of Tampa, police officers approached me.
[01:35:52.539 --> 01:35:54.461]  I had on my Attorney Response Team uniform.
[01:35:54.741 --> 01:35:55.462]  That's the shirt.
[01:35:55.482 --> 01:35:59.265]  In fact, we should punch up Attorney Response Team t-shirt for folks so they can see it.
[01:36:00.526 --> 01:36:03.588]  He saw what I was doing and he wanted a free DVD.
[01:36:04.068 --> 01:36:09.431]  I thanked him for taking it and told him we were depending on him to uphold the Constitution.
[01:36:09.751 --> 01:36:10.832]  He said he would do his best.
[01:36:11.909 --> 01:36:21.154]  This last Saturday, on July 11th, I passed out DVDs at a business intersection at a red light, passing them out to cars and pedestrians alike.
[01:36:21.594 --> 01:36:25.577]  At one point, a Hillsborough County Sheriff's pulled up and rolled his window down.
[01:36:25.857 --> 01:36:27.398]  He asked, is that an Alex Jones movie?
[01:36:27.778 --> 01:36:28.058]  Yes.
[01:36:28.818 --> 01:36:30.079]  I have watched it several times.
[01:36:30.499 --> 01:36:34.361]  He had the copy of the DVD on his car seat and showed me.
[01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:35.022]  I said, wow.
[01:36:35.602 --> 01:36:37.023]  A few minutes later, he was able
[01:36:38.319 --> 01:36:39.620]  To pull off the road to talk.
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:47.307]  He said that his brother had sent him the DVD and he had seen several other of Alex's movies and was a regular listener of the radio show via internet.
[01:36:47.847 --> 01:36:51.610]  I told him also that we were depending on him to uphold the Constitution.
[01:36:52.511 --> 01:36:55.293]  We shook hands and in parting he said, the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:36:59.594 --> 01:37:02.660]  See, that's why they're so afraid of Liberty Movement.
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:11.096]  Because these men and women have a hunger to be with George Washington, to be with the Founding Fathers, to be with
[01:37:13.188 --> 01:37:16.149]  Colonel Travis at the Alamo, to be real Americans.
[01:37:16.649 --> 01:37:17.470]  Everybody does.
[01:37:18.170 --> 01:37:21.131]  This is our heritage, it's who we are, it's in our guts.
[01:37:21.932 --> 01:37:29.415]  And they've taken the police and twisted their minds, and they've taken the public and twisted our minds, and they've set up this horrible system.
[01:37:31.055 --> 01:37:42.520]  But the establishment knows that if the people have a choice between this chicken-neck demon, John P. Holdren, let's put him on screen, who says he wants to force-drug us and CPS our kids,
[01:37:43.607 --> 01:37:50.453]  A choice between that, and freedom, and liberty, and the Second Amendment, and God's guts and guns, and Fourth of July, and freedom.
[01:37:51.254 --> 01:37:53.016]  They're going to want the freedom!
[01:37:55.538 --> 01:37:59.822]  And so, all of us have to really work on reaching out to the military and police.
[01:37:59.842 --> 01:38:05.067]  And I know, I blow out the handle, and I tend to go after the police a lot.
[01:38:05.287 --> 01:38:07.269]  And I've said this the last year since I figured it out.
[01:38:07.409 --> 01:38:07.909]  I'm growing.
[01:38:08.249 --> 01:38:09.110]  I'm learning all the time.
[01:38:09.170 --> 01:38:09.791]  I'm not perfect.
[01:38:11.649 --> 01:38:13.470]  That plays into the globalist plan.
[01:38:15.231 --> 01:38:16.272]  That plays into it.
[01:38:17.072 --> 01:38:22.215]  Because they go give the police training and a culture that then makes the public not like them.
[01:38:22.655 --> 01:38:25.297]  Then they say, see to the cops, the public doesn't like you.
[01:38:26.769 --> 01:38:31.613]  And then that further compacts the police into their area, and the citizens into their area.
[01:38:31.673 --> 01:38:33.675]  It's another divide and conquer.
[01:38:34.235 --> 01:38:39.920]  So when Anderson Cooper, who's admittedly CIA... Oh, I was CIA, he said, but then I went and joined CNN.
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:41.722]  The heir to the Astor fortune.
[01:38:42.102 --> 01:38:43.463]  A disgusting globalist.
[01:38:43.843 --> 01:38:44.684]  A piece of trash.
[01:38:45.145 --> 01:38:45.585]  On record.
[01:38:46.185 --> 01:38:54.853]  When he does all these constant TV shows about cops in Texas robbing people, and there are some bad towns and counties that are doing this.
[01:38:56.604 --> 01:39:06.867]  Instead of having a newscast about how the state government and the state police was supposed to go after these people, CNN kind of halfway legitimizes it, but then says the feds need to federalize.
[01:39:10.011 --> 01:39:15.172]  When you don't have Texas towns running giant white slavery rings like Dyncor and Halliburton are.
[01:39:15.512 --> 01:39:17.892]  See, you got the big federal international evil.
[01:39:18.253 --> 01:39:22.773]  It loves to show you the little local corruption as a pretext to come in and take over.
[01:39:23.093 --> 01:39:25.394]  And they love to show the police beating people.
[01:39:25.634 --> 01:39:29.435]  They love to show out-of-control thug cops choking teenagers for no reason.
[01:39:29.735 --> 01:39:30.415]  And it's wrong!
[01:39:32.555 --> 01:39:33.695]  It's wrong that they're doing that.
[01:39:33.755 --> 01:39:36.336]  But the issue is, why are they showing it so much?
[01:39:37.338 --> 01:39:42.042]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, they want us at each other's throats.
[01:39:42.583 --> 01:39:44.624]  They want us to get into a fight with each other.
[01:39:44.865 --> 01:39:46.246]  They want us to kill each other.
[01:39:46.946 --> 01:39:57.415]  They are planning on instigating a revolution in this country that is going to slaughter the police and military, and then after everything breaks down, just like in Argentina and other countries, and I've had economists on from there, same thing.
[01:39:57.435 --> 01:40:04.742]  Local cops and military get shot up, the citizens get shot up, and then six months later everybody's tired of rioting, and then the globalists come in.
[01:40:06.104 --> 01:40:09.065]  This has been done over and over and over again.
[01:40:09.085 --> 01:40:10.605]  So I've said I've made a lot of mistakes.
[01:40:10.745 --> 01:40:13.806]  I never claim to have all the answers, understand all the psychological warfare.
[01:40:15.407 --> 01:40:19.868]  I was talking to a friend of mine the other day and he said, have you seen the CIA declassified report?
[01:40:19.888 --> 01:40:20.448]  And I said, no.
[01:40:20.528 --> 01:40:21.049]  I googled it.
[01:40:21.489 --> 01:40:24.230]  Another CIA training manual release from 63.
[01:40:24.810 --> 01:40:28.491]  How to torture people, how to break them, how to control local populations.
[01:40:28.611 --> 01:40:32.032]  And I sat there for two hours and read the whole document.
[01:40:32.712 --> 01:40:34.773]  And it was everything I'm already seeing the feds do.
[01:40:35.737 --> 01:40:40.101]  See, I'm just learning so much so fast and I don't even have ways to describe it.
[01:40:41.062 --> 01:40:46.727]  I just wish we could end this nightmare and arrest all these bankers and eugenicist trash!
[01:40:47.548 --> 01:40:48.529]  I'm sick of them!
[01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:53.013]  And I'm sick of how the whole thing's run by psychologists and psychiatrists.
[01:40:53.908 --> 01:41:04.534]  Who know how to manipulate us, and they're playing games with us, and manipulating our society, and manipulating our social system, and the way men operate, and the way women operate.
[01:41:04.774 --> 01:41:06.235]  They know how we operate.
[01:41:06.515 --> 01:41:08.136]  They know how we work, folks.
[01:41:08.616 --> 01:41:18.341]  And they're manipulating us, just like we're in a Petri dish, and they got a microscope studying us, and looking at us, and understanding how we operate.
[01:41:18.401 --> 01:41:19.302]  That's what they're doing.
[01:41:20.856 --> 01:41:22.437]  So we've got to learn sociology.
[01:41:22.517 --> 01:41:23.878]  We've got to learn psychology.
[01:41:23.958 --> 01:41:25.318]  We've got to read their manuals.
[01:41:25.378 --> 01:41:35.563]  We've got to learn what these bastards have done because they have cold-bloodedly come in with science and screwed our society up to make us dependent on them.
[01:41:35.583 --> 01:41:40.546]  You know, I didn't take a lot of calls today and I said I was and I covered some eugenics.
[01:41:41.486 --> 01:41:42.627]  I'm doing the best I can here.
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:46.861]  Everybody keeps saying, oh, the show's great, you're doing a good job.
[01:41:47.541 --> 01:42:02.426]  I know, but still, I just, when you know about this level of evil, you know about these criminals operating in plain view, you know they're poisoning the water, you know they're poisoning the food on record, it's just, you expect to see things instantly change.
[01:42:03.393 --> 01:42:05.015]  But that's not how things work.
[01:42:05.035 --> 01:42:06.596]  They didn't build their system overnight.
[01:42:06.636 --> 01:42:10.020]  We're not going to dismantle their system and get the Republic back overnight.
[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:21.211]  But number one, having the attitude to win, the attitude to take action, having the facts, getting involved, you will get better at what you're doing by stepping up, by taking action.
[01:42:22.034 --> 01:42:23.875]  And so I can't expose all the eugenics.
[01:42:23.935 --> 01:42:31.100]  I mean, literally, I have seven stacks in here, this tall, each one, pure mainstream news, pushing eugenics, telling you how great it is to be sterilized.
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:33.201]  I mean, it's just off the charts.
[01:42:34.422 --> 01:42:36.543]  And I've covered probably 30 or 40 of those today.
[01:42:36.583 --> 01:42:38.324]  The point is, go look at it for yourself.
[01:42:38.404 --> 01:42:39.485]  It's a bottomless pit.
[01:42:40.005 --> 01:42:46.630]  They're committing crimes and evil and micromanaging control-freak garbage so fast, I can't even
[01:42:48.212 --> 01:42:49.253]  Track it!
[01:42:49.433 --> 01:42:58.402]  It's just a criminal society has taken over, they use scientific techniques, and we're all in the same boat.
[01:42:58.462 --> 01:43:00.263]  They are screwing all of us.
[01:43:00.444 --> 01:43:04.808]  I don't care who you are, or what you are, or what color you are, or where you live.
[01:43:06.172 --> 01:43:26.593]  But I know this, I'm getting letters from Brazil, and letters from South Korea, and letters from Japan, and letters from Russia, and calls from Russia, and I talk to contractors, and I talk to workers, and I talk to family who are on cruise ships in other parts of the world, and who work at factories in other parts of the world, and have people walk up to them and say, have you heard of InfoWars.com?
[01:43:26.633 --> 01:43:27.774]  Have you heard of Alex Jones?
[01:43:28.795 --> 01:43:36.878]  The responsibility of the fact that I'm trying to play down the people we reach, but I know the establishment knows, I'm reaching tens of millions now every month.
[01:43:37.318 --> 01:43:37.578]  New.
[01:43:38.019 --> 01:43:39.839]  I mean, we've hit mega-viral level.
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:43.781]  My radio show and the films are just a tiny little node.
[01:43:44.281 --> 01:43:49.003]  It's like a virus, but a good virus, that just you introduce a few viruses and then it turns into billions.
[01:43:51.434 --> 01:43:52.734]  I'm under total surveillance.
[01:43:53.175 --> 01:43:55.275]  I've got all sorts of black ops being pulled on me.
[01:43:55.355 --> 01:43:58.616]  I just ignore it and trust in God, you know, to go through the storm.
[01:43:58.756 --> 01:44:00.117]  I'm happy I've done this.
[01:44:00.457 --> 01:44:01.477]  You're only alive once.
[01:44:01.757 --> 01:44:04.838]  But the issue is we're making history right now.
[01:44:04.858 --> 01:44:11.020]  And the establishment is launching all sorts of COINTELPRO, whisper campaigns, black ops attacks.
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:14.422]  They're pulling out all the stops on me, trying to set me up.
[01:44:15.182 --> 01:44:18.363]  And I just want folks to know whatever happens to me, it's a victory.
[01:44:19.269 --> 01:44:23.410]  The testament to what I've been able to do with your help taking action.
[01:44:23.670 --> 01:44:24.451]  The testament.
[01:44:25.851 --> 01:44:34.954]  These type of stories that this writer, John in Tampa Bay, tells me where all the cops he sees are awake.
[01:44:35.854 --> 01:44:43.116]  I mean, it's just... I was talking to a friend last night who was in Oregon.
[01:44:44.301 --> 01:44:45.301]  Visiting family.
[01:44:46.102 --> 01:44:48.762]  I believe she told me the story, but she was visiting some friends in Florida.
[01:44:49.423 --> 01:44:50.543]  I mean, and I was thinking of Florida.
[01:44:50.623 --> 01:44:52.384]  And let me go back to the exact story.
[01:44:52.404 --> 01:44:52.644]  Hold on.
[01:44:52.924 --> 01:44:54.124]  Kind of download that here mentally.
[01:44:54.144 --> 01:45:02.327]  And it's also the friends... Somebody don't want to be mentioned on air, so I want to be careful not to mention that.
[01:45:02.647 --> 01:45:04.127]  I was talking to a friend last night.
[01:45:04.207 --> 01:45:04.867]  We were having dinner.
[01:45:05.728 --> 01:45:06.828]  My wife and I and some friends.
[01:45:06.988 --> 01:45:13.010]  And this friend was talking about how she was in... No, it was her mother!
[01:45:14.702 --> 01:45:21.428]  Our friend's mother was traveling, visiting family in Oregon, and she went to the Buffalo Bill Show.
[01:45:22.849 --> 01:45:25.652]  Because I guess there's a company that does that around the country.
[01:45:26.511 --> 01:45:34.974]  And they were at the Buffalo Bill Show, and they were just talking to some young man who was part of the Buffalo Bill Show, and he said, oh, have you heard of Infowars.com and Alex Jones?
[01:45:35.475 --> 01:45:38.996]  And then the mother of one of my friends was like, absolutely!
[01:45:39.036 --> 01:45:44.518]  And then suddenly there were more people there, and they were talking about, hey, everybody's awake here, we know what's going on.
[01:45:45.199 --> 01:45:53.522]  My only point in telling that story is that everywhere I go and everybody I talk to, they're having the same experiences.
[01:45:54.767 --> 01:46:05.250]  And I get calls and I get letters from New York and Wisconsin and South Texas and Colorado and New Zealand.
[01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:10.652]  I've had police departments call and say, did you do this?
[01:46:10.712 --> 01:46:14.774]  Did you spray paint InfoWars.com on this big derelict city building?
[01:46:15.634 --> 01:46:21.556]  And they'll send us a photo in New Zealand of InfoWars.com spray painted all across it and I'm like, no!
[01:46:24.197 --> 01:46:31.143]  Or I'll get a mean letter going, how dare you in these falls in Hawaii carve Infowars into the rock?
[01:46:31.744 --> 01:46:35.947]  Or people spray painting road signs in Colorado thinking I'm doing it.
[01:46:36.247 --> 01:46:38.429]  The point is folks, it's everywhere.
[01:46:38.549 --> 01:46:43.233]  And then I realize we have tens of millions of people listening to us.
[01:46:44.514 --> 01:46:46.676]  We've actually got the attention of the people
[01:46:48.345 --> 01:46:49.406]  What am I supposed to do?
[01:46:49.426 --> 01:46:56.430]  I mean, it's not even so much as a weight, it's just almost embarrassing.
[01:46:56.490 --> 01:46:58.431]  I mean, I'm not the guy for this job.
[01:46:58.491 --> 01:47:02.314]  I'm not the guy to be the leader of the resistance against the New World Order.
[01:47:02.554 --> 01:47:04.395]  But at the same time, who else is there?
[01:47:04.975 --> 01:47:05.575]  It's you.
[01:47:06.916 --> 01:47:09.118]  They can kill me individually, they can destroy my name.
[01:47:09.983 --> 01:47:11.646]  I've been analyzing their attack profile.
[01:47:11.666 --> 01:47:16.513]  They're more likely to invent scandals against me, but I'm so clean, I'm so square, it's hard to do.
[01:47:17.414 --> 01:47:22.101]  But whatever they do to me, don't see the movement as about Alex Jones.
[01:47:22.421 --> 01:47:23.883]  See it as about liberty and freedom.
[01:47:24.952 --> 01:47:28.435]  And realize you're a leader, and that they can't kill ideas.
[01:47:28.955 --> 01:47:46.410]  And that you, by going out, handing out DVDs, handing out films, handing out articles, handing out websites, starting your own local radio show, starting AXS TV, starting your own local activist group, by going out and going to city council and taking action, if you will take action, people will join you.
[01:47:46.730 --> 01:47:48.332]  If you will build it, they will come.
[01:47:48.712 --> 01:47:51.294]  If you will engage the enemy, we can defeat them.
[01:47:51.334 --> 01:47:53.296]  Because the enemy's coming in like a flood now!
[01:47:53.516 --> 01:47:54.597]  There's no more denials.
[01:47:54.737 --> 01:47:56.138]  Open world government's been announced.
[01:47:56.578 --> 01:48:06.585]  And I always knew at this key juncture that if I got out there and warned as many people as I could about the globalist plan and didn't hold back, a lot of other folks knew as much as I did.
[01:48:06.625 --> 01:48:09.447]  They just didn't want to sound kooky, so they only put a little bit out.
[01:48:09.807 --> 01:48:17.652]  I went all the way to the wall with the most radical info I could that was factual, knowing that people wouldn't believe me then.
[01:48:18.723 --> 01:48:33.486]  But that as it all came true, then they would remember, and that it's that power of revelation, it's that power of the foresight that people pay attention to, and that by doing that, they would then wake up and get involved and join us.
[01:48:34.505 --> 01:48:35.105]  And we've done that.
[01:48:35.145 --> 01:48:38.587]  We planted tens of millions of seeds all across the world.
[01:48:38.627 --> 01:48:43.290]  And now those have grown mentally and spiritually and they are planting seeds.
[01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:46.031]  And so the great harvest is coming.
[01:48:46.292 --> 01:48:48.353]  So the enemy is going to stage nuclear attacks.
[01:48:48.633 --> 01:48:50.034]  They're going to stage flu attacks.
[01:48:50.254 --> 01:48:52.775]  They're going to stage World War III type events, wars.
[01:48:53.215 --> 01:48:55.577]  They are going to bankrupt everything by design.
[01:48:56.017 --> 01:48:57.318]  They are going to bring in hell.
[01:48:58.178 --> 01:49:00.980]  In an attempt to block us, but they were already going to do that.
[01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:03.662]  We're now just engaging them on our terms.
[01:49:04.222 --> 01:49:05.443]  They were attacking us anyways.
[01:49:05.483 --> 01:49:06.764]  We just decided to fight back.
[01:49:07.544 --> 01:49:09.826]  Some people say, well, you're goading them into moving quicker.
[01:49:10.106 --> 01:49:10.767]  Yes, we are.
[01:49:11.567 --> 01:49:17.251]  If they're behind in the race, they don't have the pole position, we can force them to drive recklessly.
[01:49:17.591 --> 01:49:20.493]  We can force them to try to push the situation.
[01:49:20.933 --> 01:49:26.437]  That means that they've got the momentum and the power and the money, but we got the numbers and the truth.
[01:49:26.957 --> 01:49:27.318]  And that
[01:49:27.978 --> 01:49:35.263]  It's a fight of our lives, a fight for our lives, and we're going to go 110% into this fight, swinging as hard as we can, committing.
[01:49:35.544 --> 01:49:49.093]  And when you commit and stop caring what happens to your body, what happens to your name, when you just get in the fight and go 110%, you're pretty much assured of victory, folks, if you'll just gut up and go absolutely A. In the Info War.
[01:49:49.193 --> 01:49:49.694]  Stay with us.
[01:49:52.529 --> 01:49:57.837]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:49:58.337 --> 01:50:05.347]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:50:05.914 --> 01:50:12.117]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:50:12.497 --> 01:50:14.338]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:50:14.478 --> 01:50:16.899]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:50:16.979 --> 01:50:27.945]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:50:28.545 --> 01:50:29.846]  It's not about left or right.
[01:50:30.206 --> 01:50:31.627]  It's about a one world government.
[01:50:32.088 --> 01:50:38.412]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:50:38.993 --> 01:50:46.758]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:47.259 --> 01:50:48.400]  The Obama Deception.
[01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:50.021]  The people strike back.
[01:50:51.812 --> 01:50:52.893]  Economy, have you down?
[01:50:53.073 --> 01:50:54.614]  Scared you might lose your job?
[01:50:54.754 --> 01:50:56.675]  Worry how you will provide for your family?
[01:50:56.835 --> 01:50:58.757]  Do you worry where your money will come from?
[01:50:58.957 --> 01:51:01.959]  You know that the economy is getting worse, but there is hope!
[01:51:02.259 --> 01:51:06.542]  Robert Beatles' new book, Here's What You Do, tells you what to do and how to do it!

[01:51:10.344 --> 01:51:11.084]  And the best part?
[01:51:11.265 --> 01:51:13.006]  This book is priced under $10!
[01:51:13.286 --> 01:51:14.947]  Don't be the victim, be a victor!

[01:51:17.308 --> 01:51:18.950]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[01:51:19.170 --> 01:51:20.470]  Again, hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[01:51:21.351 --> 01:51:22.832]  Wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[01:51:22.952 --> 01:51:27.255]  Is your financial advisor experienced enough to combat rising interest rates, taxes, inflation?

[01:51:42.565 --> 01:51:42.845]  That's 877-479-8178.
[01:51:42.865 --> 01:51:42.905]  877-479-8178.
[01:51:52.412 --> 01:51:53.893]  Do you have trouble getting through the day?
[01:51:54.234 --> 01:51:55.975]  Do you feel tired and worn out?
[01:51:56.576 --> 01:51:57.537]  It's a proven fact.
[01:51:57.877 --> 01:52:01.941]  Many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[01:52:02.461 --> 01:52:07.646]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.
[01:52:08.167 --> 01:52:09.988]  Introducing Choose4Health.
[01:52:10.489 --> 01:52:15.693]  Choose4Health brings you 16 powerful ingredients in one delicious chewable.
[01:52:19.735 --> 01:52:20.135]  I think so.
[01:52:41.846 --> 01:52:43.627]  No credit card, and no auto-ship.
[01:52:43.887 --> 01:52:44.728]  That number again is 1-800-210-1922.
[01:52:44.748 --> 01:52:45.048]  That's 1-800-210-1922.
[01:53:01.747 --> 01:53:05.131]  Yeah, it's gotta be no more Mr. Nice Guy with the New World Order boys.
[01:53:06.072 --> 01:53:14.020]  And if we step up to the plate, we take action, a lot of people inside the globalist system who don't like what's happening, they're gonna speak up as well.
[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:17.043]  And then this whole New World Order is gonna collapse.
[01:53:17.884 --> 01:53:19.325]  But, that isn't enough.
[01:53:20.687 --> 01:53:23.750]  Society itself has become very decadent and immoral.
[01:53:25.316 --> 01:53:27.038]  But you gotta fall before you can rise.
[01:53:27.799 --> 01:53:28.619]  Myself included.
[01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:33.605]  We just all gotta love God, love our families, try to be good people, not be quick to anger.
[01:53:34.005 --> 01:53:35.347]  Lord knows I'm one of the worst at that.
[01:53:35.827 --> 01:53:38.370]  To really gauge things and know what's going on.
[01:53:38.650 --> 01:53:40.212]  Not get into being stupid.
[01:53:41.479 --> 01:53:45.241]  Like the foolish police that go, you know, steal some veteran's upside-down flag.
[01:53:45.582 --> 01:53:48.684]  Even if it was a sign of disrespect, it's his right to do it!
[01:53:49.324 --> 01:53:55.368]  When you urinate on the First Amendment, you've destroyed the spirit of what the flag symbolizes.
[01:53:55.668 --> 01:53:58.330]  If we don't have these rights, the flag's just three colors.
[01:54:00.391 --> 01:54:04.754]  The United States isn't special, it's just more dirt if we don't have our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:54:07.591 --> 01:54:08.252]  You know, here I am.
[01:54:08.312 --> 01:54:14.718]  I've done all these hours of radio broadcasts and haven't even really plugged much of the films or books and materials, but be sure and check them out at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:15.879 --> 01:54:17.700]  We broke down a lot of stuff at the first of the show.
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:19.262]  The rebroadcast is coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:54:19.762 --> 01:54:26.589]  I did want to tell listeners about a few of the sponsors that also made today's radio transmission possible, and one of them is eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:54:26.609 --> 01:54:32.914]  This is the source, the name, in high-quality, storable foods, non-GMO, non-hybrid, no MSG, no garbage.
[01:54:33.735 --> 01:54:45.440]  And they got free catalogs, free videos you can watch about the food at E, the letter E, foodsdirect.com, efoodsdirect.com, big banners up on infowars.com if you missed it, or 1-800-409-5633.
[01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:51.243]  You've got to be self-sufficient, you've got to be prepared going into these crazy waters, this crazy time we're entering.
[01:54:51.983 --> 01:54:53.384]  When it looks like they're going for broke.
[01:54:54.025 --> 01:54:56.467]  You need firearms and food and things like that.
[01:54:56.487 --> 01:54:58.269]  800-409-5633.
[01:54:58.289 --> 01:55:02.373]  800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com.
[01:55:03.034 --> 01:55:08.920]  And I also want to remind listeners, Ted is selling gold at 30-something dollars lower than what the market is.
[01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:13.604]  You know, he bought gold at 913, it's above 940, and he's selling it with no markup.
[01:55:13.944 --> 01:55:15.206]  So it's an incredible discount.
[01:55:15.746 --> 01:55:18.047]  And that won't last very, very long.
[01:55:18.487 --> 01:55:19.408]  So 800-686-2237.
[01:55:19.428 --> 01:55:22.289]  800-686-2237.
[01:55:24.370 --> 01:55:27.651]  Modest Resources also making this radio show possible.
[01:55:28.052 --> 01:55:37.196]  Another one of our fine sponsors that I want you to know about is, in closing, is, before I make a few final comments, is FrontSite.com.
[01:55:38.422 --> 01:55:41.286]  Have you ever heard of the millionaire patriot Dr. Ignatius Piazza?
[01:55:41.646 --> 01:55:47.274]  The founder of the Front Sight Firearms Training Institute is offering a free handgun and five days of firearms training to my listeners.
[01:55:48.095 --> 01:55:52.761]  This offer is only available for a limited time because Dr. Piazza is literally paying out of his own pocket to
[01:55:53.442 --> 01:55:57.324]  I'm talking to a lot of friends and neighbors and others who are planning to do this in the fall when it's not so hot.
[01:55:57.344 --> 01:55:59.145]  So if I was you, I'd get booked now, folks, because
[01:56:24.131 --> 01:56:26.852]  People are really, really getting excited about this FrontSite.com.
[01:56:27.173 --> 01:56:28.393]  Again, I want to thank the sponsors.
[01:56:28.413 --> 01:56:29.414]  They make the show possible.
[01:56:29.434 --> 01:56:32.415]  I want to thank the crew up here.
[01:56:32.435 --> 01:56:38.678]  You know, when I hire somebody to work here, and I tend to do it with these blind ads because I don't want to hire fans.
[01:56:39.218 --> 01:56:43.540]  Not that fans are bad, but you put a public ad out, you get infiltrators.
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:44.140]  We've had them.
[01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:44.800]  It's not fun.
[01:56:45.641 --> 01:56:50.063]  I have a profession where I deal with infiltrators.
[01:56:51.738 --> 01:57:02.769]  This isn't Kansas, ladies and gentlemen, but I want to thank the crew we've got, because I tell them when they come to work here, I say, uh, you're signing on to get sent to Camp X-Ray, boys and girls, if we don't beat these people.
[01:57:02.809 --> 01:57:12.199]  So I want to commend our cheerful crew, and I want to commend the Genesis Network and all of our Aminathem affiliates, the Global Shortwave listeners, everybody else out there.
[01:57:13.504 --> 01:57:18.046]  And I just can't stress enough what the Obama Deception and Endgame are doing out there with all of you making copies of them.
[01:57:18.406 --> 01:57:18.946]  Keep that up.
[01:57:18.986 --> 01:57:19.967]  We salute all of you.
[01:57:20.467 --> 01:57:22.848]  Key retransmission starts now.
