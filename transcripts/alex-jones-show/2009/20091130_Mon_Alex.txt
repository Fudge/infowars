[00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:10.067]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.132]  I'm here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:14.252 --> 00:00:14.953]  to 3 p.m.
[00:00:15.013 --> 00:00:15.474]  Central.
[00:00:17.736 --> 00:00:20.139]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:20.640]  Eastern.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.782]  I come back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:23.063]  Central.
[00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:36.257]  We are now simulcasting the last two and a half hours of this radio show in living color via PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:36.277 --> 00:00:43.568]  I want to just remind all the internet viewers that every year we've done this for five and a half years that we've had PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:54.087]  You get five and a half months, is what it comes out to, free at PrisonPlanet.tv when you sign up for a year membership.
[00:00:54.107 --> 00:00:57.831]  So you pay for six and a half months, you get five and a half months free, or get the trial, $5.95.
[00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:05.418]  Test membership, all of my films in super high quality, like Fall of the Republic, exclusive expanded interviews.
[00:01:05.758 --> 00:01:09.002]  We flew to Phoenix to interview David Icke.
[00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:14.558]  Expanded extras like Endgame 1.5 just for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:21.204]  You can burn and download on DivX, on the regular CD that plays on most DVD players, to give to people.
[00:01:21.244 --> 00:01:24.046]  It's an armory of resistance in the InfoWar.
[00:01:24.387 --> 00:01:26.789]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:34.155]  And we are running, until they exhaust the supply, a combo special.
[00:01:34.175 --> 00:01:36.296]  We've got a whole bunch of combos just until Christmas.
[00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:45.960]  So you can spread the word and also support the broadcast and the filmmaking and our whole independent media operation that is entirely viewer and listener supported.
[00:01:47.081 --> 00:01:49.784]  Fall of the Republic, the presidency of Barack H. Obama.
[00:01:50.305 --> 00:01:55.411]  When you buy this DVD for $19.95, you get free the Obama Joker shirt.
[00:01:56.553 --> 00:02:07.982]  And there's four different messages, InfoWars.com on the back, on the front, socialism, fascism, new world order, InfoWars.com, your choice, under Obama as the joker that the media called for banning.
[00:02:08.402 --> 00:02:09.543]  That's a limited time shirt.
[00:02:09.623 --> 00:02:11.845]  When it's sold out, it's sold out.
[00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:16.628]  We're not going to print any more, so get the free t-shirt right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:16.648 --> 00:02:24.094]  There's a bunch of other combos where you can get in-game free with Fall of the Republic, where you can get reflections and warnings free with Fall of the Republic.
[00:02:24.114 --> 00:02:26.356]  We're only doing that until Christmas.
[00:02:26.976 --> 00:02:35.959]  And you may be fully awake to all this, but your friends, your family, your neighbors, if you burn them a copy of my film, which I encourage you to do, they may not watch it because it's just a CD you gave them.
[00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:46.103]  But if you give them A Fall of the Republic, or an Obama Deception, or an Endgame, or Reflections and Warnings, or America Freedom to Fascism that we sell, or all the other great films and books and materials, they will watch it.
[00:02:46.143 --> 00:02:46.843]  They will view it.
[00:02:47.816 --> 00:02:53.822]  So order those at Infowars.com or you can also give somebody a prisonplanet.tv membership.
[00:02:53.842 --> 00:03:01.129]  Just create the username and password and give it to them in an e-card and you can have six IPs signed on at one time with your membership.
[00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:04.793]  So you can give yourself a membership and then also give it to somebody else as a
[00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:05.853]  Membership.
[00:03:05.893 --> 00:03:08.754]  So that's our little present of truth to you.
[00:03:08.794 --> 00:03:10.115]  We are proffering this to you.
[00:03:10.135 --> 00:03:11.275]  We are offering this to you.
[00:03:11.575 --> 00:03:18.858]  We hope that you take advantage of it because people have never been this ready to awaken as they are now.
[00:03:19.838 --> 00:03:24.760]  Okay, that said, I said we're going to have wide open phones today.
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.300]  No guest.
[00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:27.862]  We have some big guests coming up later in the week.
[00:03:28.182 --> 00:03:30.383]  We had Charlie Sheen on in the last week live.
[00:03:31.424 --> 00:03:34.405]  We had, of course, Jesse Ventura back on live.
[00:03:34.465 --> 00:03:35.926]  We had Lord Monckton live.
[00:03:37.306 --> 00:03:40.068]  We've got some other huge guests coming up this week.
[00:03:40.088 --> 00:03:43.109]  I'm just going to leave it at that and let them be surprises for you.
[00:03:46.251 --> 00:03:48.812]  And no, Dave Mustaine is not one of the surprise guests.
[00:03:49.793 --> 00:03:50.554]  I think so.
[00:04:06.368 --> 00:04:09.932]  I called his assistant up, and Mike was so nice, he goes, oh Dave's right here asleep.
[00:04:10.452 --> 00:04:11.013]  Wake up Dave!
[00:04:11.113 --> 00:04:12.074]  I said, no don't wake him up!
[00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:15.878]  And he invited me up to Dallas, but he's got to make sure he has the time.
[00:04:15.898 --> 00:04:21.483]  So I'm probably going to get a face-to-face video interview with Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, who's now become a Christian.
[00:04:22.424 --> 00:04:22.845]  I think so.
[00:04:40.442 --> 00:04:50.345]  Sells out stadiums of 50,000 here in the United States, 200,000 in Italy, 200,000 in Brazil, hundreds of thousands in Japan, hundreds of thousands in Russia.
[00:04:50.866 --> 00:04:54.847]  Megadeth is one of the top three heavy metal bands of all time.
[00:04:55.287 --> 00:04:57.108]  Probably number one or number two, they debate that.
[00:04:57.428 --> 00:04:59.909]  But globally, they are definitely the big enchilada.
[00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:05.891]  And now all those Megadeth listeners are hearing Dave Mustaine reach out to them
[00:05:07.253 --> 00:05:08.174]  Okay, I want to give you
[00:05:21.866 --> 00:05:32.918]  My take on the tragic police shooting that happened yesterday in a suburb of Seattle, Washington, where four policemen, three male, one female, were ambushed, slaughtered.
[00:05:33.598 --> 00:05:37.743]  And a trend I noticed, and when I see something, I just have to report it, even if it's politically incorrect.
[00:05:38.183 --> 00:05:38.884]  That's coming up.
[00:05:39.204 --> 00:05:40.786]  I want to get into the latest on Climategate.
[00:05:40.806 --> 00:05:42.548]  This is breaking even bigger than I thought it would.
[00:05:42.568 --> 00:05:43.329]  This is beautiful.
[00:05:44.943 --> 00:05:49.667]  What a great Christmas present to everybody who loves truth and values truth and dignity and integrity.
[00:05:50.448 --> 00:05:53.511]  A bunch of economic news as the global meltdown intensifies.
[00:05:54.171 --> 00:05:55.332]  That is all coming up.
[00:05:55.472 --> 00:06:00.037]  And then your phone calls, Mike, Joe, Thomas, Greg, Russ, and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:06:00.057 --> 00:06:02.199]  But I want to start getting to some video clips today.
[00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:05.882]  The first one is We Are Change Chicago.
[00:06:05.902 --> 00:06:11.427]  And the intro video is a clip of Al Gore on TV and then Al Gore being confronted on C-SPAN.
[00:06:13.105 --> 00:06:20.766]  And then the next clip, of course, is them live last week at one of his book signings confronting him.
[00:06:24.827 --> 00:06:31.952]  And in videos like this, in the action We Are Change Chicago took is the victory against the New World Order.
[00:06:31.972 --> 00:06:34.674]  I'll explain why and how after the clip.
[00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:37.315]  And I've got some other clips here I want to play as well.
[00:06:37.335 --> 00:06:46.341]  But for viewers and radio listeners, if you're a radio listener and aren't watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, we have the We Are Change Chicago article posted up on InfoWars.com.
[00:06:48.263 --> 00:06:54.234]  And this is the beginning of the end for these people, and it's totally peaceful and honorable and wonderful what they're doing, and I salute them.
[00:06:54.254 --> 00:06:54.595]  Here it is.
[00:06:58.516 --> 00:06:59.557]  Good for you, sir.
[00:07:00.017 --> 00:07:03.159]  Did you know that fluorescent light bulbs last ten times longer than regular ones?
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.361]  Yep, and they only use one quarter of the power.
[00:07:06.642 --> 00:07:11.165]  But if we're going to solve the climate crisis, we've got to change more than the light bulbs and the windows.
[00:07:11.225 --> 00:07:16.689]  We've got to change the laws and the policies through collective political action on a large scale.
[00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:23.013]  Kenneth, encourage your lawmakers to take action and recycle everything, including jokes.
[00:07:23.593 --> 00:07:24.214]  Sorry, sir, what?
[00:07:27.824 --> 00:07:29.005]  The whale is in trouble.
[00:07:29.065 --> 00:07:31.045]  I have to go.
[00:07:31.105 --> 00:07:37.248]  Congressman, you began by denying that there is a consensus on the science.
[00:07:38.049 --> 00:07:40.069]  There is a consensus on the science.
[00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:47.633]  You must have been listening to our testimony that we've had for the last few days with dozens of experts that have come in who have given completely different views.
[00:07:47.673 --> 00:07:52.115]  Well, there are... So I would encourage you to go back and look at the testimony this committee's heard.
[00:07:52.655 --> 00:07:58.500]  There are people who still believe that the moon landing was staged on a movie lot in Arizona.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.461]  This guy's preaching.
[00:07:59.982 --> 00:08:03.144]  Of course, we'll see that John Coleman won't debate anybody.
[00:08:03.605 --> 00:08:05.747]  The IPCC isn't really a bunch of scientists.
[00:08:05.827 --> 00:08:06.728]  It's a bunch of U.N.
[00:08:06.748 --> 00:08:07.208]  globalists.
[00:08:07.328 --> 00:08:09.110]  I mean, are you guys looking into this stuff?
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.648]  Are you guys allowed to cover things like this or not?
[00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:23.415]  Did your bosses let you tell the real story about real Americans out here?
[00:08:26.938 --> 00:08:31.119]  Vice President Al Gore was in Chicago today to sign copies of his new book, Our Choice.
[00:08:31.479 --> 00:08:34.660]  It was a long line of supporters at the borders of what's still on State Street.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.982]  Our Choice is a follow-up to Gore's Academy Award-winning documentary, An Inconvenient Truth.
[00:08:40.542 --> 00:08:43.503]  Gore has championed environmental issues for many years.
[00:08:43.903 --> 00:08:48.524]  His book is described as a call to action and answers many of the questions posed by the film.
[00:08:49.024 --> 00:08:53.926]  Gore was a co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his work for climate change.
[00:09:04.312 --> 00:09:06.215]  They're getting up to Al Gore at the book signing.
[00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:22.653]  This is a New World Order eugenics operation!
[00:09:22.713 --> 00:09:23.373]  Don't touch me!
[00:09:23.453 --> 00:09:25.454]  This is a eugenics operation!
[00:09:25.634 --> 00:09:28.115]  This is a New World Order eugenics operation!
[00:09:28.135 --> 00:09:29.396]  Don't touch me!
[00:09:29.696 --> 00:09:30.856]  This is a eugenics operation!
[00:09:30.936 --> 00:09:33.477]  This is a New World Order eugenics operation!
[00:09:33.497 --> 00:09:34.417]  Don't touch me!
[00:09:34.437 --> 00:09:35.838]  This is a eugenics operation!
[00:09:36.358 --> 00:09:37.659]  Can I give you that, Mr. Gore?
[00:09:37.739 --> 00:09:44.344]  It's the science that shows that 31,000 scientists are speaking out against your eugenics club of Rome agenda, sir.
[00:09:44.364 --> 00:09:49.007]  The New World Order will fail, and we realize that this is against our sovereignty.
[00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:50.288]  I have a First Amendment right.
[00:09:50.328 --> 00:09:52.029]  You do not need to assault me, sir.
[00:09:52.169 --> 00:09:52.769]  I am leaving.
[00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:53.690]  I am leaving.
[00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.471]  You do not need to assault me, sir.
[00:09:55.631 --> 00:09:57.052]  I have a First Amendment right.
[00:09:57.552 --> 00:10:01.815]  This man wants to create a centralized global government.
[00:10:01.835 --> 00:10:02.676]  31,000 scientists.
[00:10:02.696 --> 00:10:05.438]  That man is... This is Nazi fascism.
[00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:06.539]  Who are you?
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.821]  Any comments on ClimateGate?
[00:10:09.102 --> 00:10:11.925]  The emails that prove it's a scam, it's a farce.
[00:10:12.366 --> 00:10:13.487]  Global warming is a joke.
[00:10:13.647 --> 00:10:14.248]  Any comment?
[00:10:14.628 --> 00:10:15.770]  Comment on ClimateGate?
[00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.032]  ClimateGate, First Amendment rights here.
[00:10:18.072 --> 00:10:18.793]  ClimateGate!
[00:10:19.254 --> 00:10:20.115]  ClimateGate!
[00:10:20.515 --> 00:10:21.917]  Research ClimateGate!
[00:10:21.957 --> 00:10:23.178]  This guy's a fraud!
[00:10:23.239 --> 00:10:24.059]  It's a scam!
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.183]  They are trying to institute a global government through a carbon tax!
[00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:31.524]  This guy's working on a carbon tax!
[00:10:31.544 --> 00:10:32.424]  That's all it is!
[00:10:32.785 --> 00:10:33.885]  It's global government!
[00:10:34.185 --> 00:10:37.367]  There are 30,000 scientists trying to sue this guy!
[00:10:37.687 --> 00:10:41.729]  John Coleman, the founder of the Weather Channel, is suing this bum!
[00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.491]  You are lying for this bum!
[00:10:44.771 --> 00:10:45.972]  It's a global government!
[00:10:45.992 --> 00:10:47.012]  Get your hands off me!
[00:10:47.293 --> 00:10:48.293]  First Amendment rights!
[00:10:48.573 --> 00:10:49.794]  Get your hands off me!
[00:10:52.714 --> 00:10:53.874]  Talk about carbon polluters.
[00:10:53.894 --> 00:10:54.614]  You talk about them.
[00:10:55.155 --> 00:11:07.757]  It's my understanding that back in 1997, when you were Vice President, Enron's CEO, Ken Lay, was involved in discussions with you at the White House about helping develop this type of policy, this trading scheme.
[00:11:08.798 --> 00:11:09.898]  Is that accurate?
[00:11:09.918 --> 00:11:10.618]  Is it inaccurate?
[00:11:10.718 --> 00:11:11.698]  It's been reported.
[00:11:12.298 --> 00:11:13.819]  I don't know.
[00:11:32.239 --> 00:11:32.900]  Unbelievable.
[00:11:34.881 --> 00:11:36.242]  This is the spirit of victory.
[00:11:37.683 --> 00:11:39.604]  This is the spirit that will defeat the tyranny.
[00:11:42.686 --> 00:11:53.514]  In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that population, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill and these dangers are caused by human intervention.
[00:11:55.117 --> 00:12:05.824]  If you believe that the reason I have been working on this issue for 30 years is because of greed, you don't know me.
[00:12:07.905 --> 00:12:08.826]  Thank you!
[00:12:09.967 --> 00:12:10.887]  Happy Thanksgiving!
[00:12:17.365 --> 00:12:28.512]  Yes!
[00:12:31.934 --> 00:12:32.994]  Everywhere he goes.
[00:12:33.695 --> 00:12:34.915]  Inside, outside.
[00:12:39.638 --> 00:12:40.079]  Traitor!
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.401]  This is how tyranny falls.
[00:12:44.304 --> 00:12:45.945]  This is true revolution.
[00:12:46.945 --> 00:12:49.926]  Oh, I just want to hug We Are Change Ohio and Chicago.
[00:12:50.406 --> 00:12:51.426]  Now they're at his car.
[00:12:53.067 --> 00:12:54.107]  Yeah!
[00:12:58.888 --> 00:13:00.209]  Running that rat to ground.
[00:13:05.828 --> 00:13:12.230]  Man, ladies and gentlemen, everywhere he goes, bigger crowds, more people confronting him.
[00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:13.330]  Climategate.
[00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:17.772]  They had multiple people split up so as they grabbed one group, another group would activate.
[00:13:18.332 --> 00:13:19.512]  No way to stop this.
[00:13:20.012 --> 00:13:22.353]  All those hundreds of fools there at the book signing.
[00:13:22.853 --> 00:13:24.394]  That the mainstream media have been promoting.
[00:13:24.474 --> 00:13:31.100]  Gore's been all over mainline TV, dramas, sitcoms, promoting his lies, telling people to pass laws.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.522]  This is government-paid-for propaganda.
[00:13:33.742 --> 00:13:38.826]  Your tax money on TV with him brainwashing the public, making him this big celebrity.
[00:13:39.086 --> 00:13:42.309]  Just like they made Obama this celebrity to sell all this garbage.
[00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.973]  Just like they made Bush a celebrity with TV shows to push the police state.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:14:01.803]  Everywhere he goes, and now the link between man-made global warming, and the global carbon tax, and global government, and eugenics, is now being made, and everyone is starting to talk about it.
[00:14:02.223 --> 00:14:08.325]  Everyone is starting to talk about eco-science, written by the White House, Science R, calling for exterminating the majority of the population.
[00:14:08.705 --> 00:14:10.045]  The signal is getting out.
[00:14:10.125 --> 00:14:12.966]  The truth, full magnitude, is now coming out.
[00:14:13.286 --> 00:14:15.467]  Thanks to you, the listeners of this radio show.
[00:14:16.207 --> 00:14:22.887]  And every one of you, I mean look at Luke Rodowski, 19 years old, gets kicked out of 9-11 Truth in New York because he wanted to go after the New World Order.
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.482]  I told him, I said, man, go start your own organization.
[00:14:27.502 --> 00:14:28.563]  We're going to support you.
[00:14:28.904 --> 00:14:30.145]  Other people picked up on it.
[00:14:30.645 --> 00:14:45.837]  The zenith of all of this, or the inception, was our listeners flocking to the term We Are Change and Luke, spreading these organizations everywhere that don't have leaders, that don't have a classical organization.
[00:14:45.897 --> 00:14:50.801]  It's an idea, not left, not right, but freedom and truth and honor.
[00:14:51.361 --> 00:14:57.027]  And this is the true populism, the true constitutional populism that will defeat the New World Order.
[00:14:57.067 --> 00:15:02.072]  You're watching nails in the coffin of the New World Order when you see video like that.
[00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:05.190]  This is just so unbelievably powerful.
[00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.611]  And I wrote some other notes during that video.
[00:15:07.892 --> 00:15:22.023]  Notice Al Gore will not debate Lord Monckton or that founder of the Weather Channel or all these meteorologists of the 30 plus thousand top scientists against the UN's 2,500 only less than 100 are real climatologists and they've all been caught in emails as fraud, lying.
[00:15:24.147 --> 00:15:28.091]  They are desperate to keep the lid on this, but the lid is already blown wide open.
[00:15:28.131 --> 00:15:34.318]  The genie's out of the bottle, the horse left the barn a long time ago, but the more they try to cover this up, the more they try to hold it down.
[00:15:34.338 --> 00:15:37.421]  I mean, oh, just the way they did that was perfect.
[00:15:37.682 --> 00:15:38.683]  I salute you.
[00:15:39.303 --> 00:15:40.164]  I thank you.
[00:15:40.825 --> 00:15:42.026]  I thank all of you.
[00:15:43.287 --> 00:15:48.552]  This is just so wonderful, and everybody's looking up online, we're mentioning on air where Al Gore is next.
[00:15:48.572 --> 00:15:52.275]  In fact, let's look up Al Gore, his itinerary.
[00:15:52.715 --> 00:15:57.019]  And I know they're not even really listing that on his site now, hoping people won't show up, they just locally promote it.
[00:15:57.219 --> 00:16:08.248]  Doesn't matter, we have listeners, we have activists, we have freedom lovers everywhere that understand that Al Gore isn't screwing up, Al Gore isn't dumb, Al Gore is an environmentalist, wacko, tree hugger.
[00:16:08.589 --> 00:16:10.991]  That would be okay, because we do have real environmental problems.
[00:16:11.611 --> 00:16:14.352]  Al Gore is a eugenicist openly.
[00:16:14.612 --> 00:16:21.954]  I was reading the Maury Strong UN quotes that are in the film from the Club of Rome where they said we're going to make humankind the enemy.
[00:16:21.974 --> 00:16:24.295]  In fact, cue that video back up for me.
[00:16:24.335 --> 00:16:25.916]  It's about three minutes till the end.
[00:16:26.676 --> 00:16:31.881]  Where it shows the quote, I want to read that full quote as we go out to break to people because I didn't have time to read it all.
[00:16:32.662 --> 00:16:39.408]  Where they say, we are going to make humanity the enemy and the government will direct the war against humanity.
[00:16:39.648 --> 00:16:48.977]  This is a war economy run by the government, run by the internal police forces, the Stasi forces they've set up to carry out eugenics.
[00:16:49.037 --> 00:16:50.399]  That's what Hitler was.
[00:16:51.627 --> 00:16:56.997]  And if the truth about this gets out, if anybody reads what Al Gore actually says, or Maury Strong, or...
[00:16:59.341 --> 00:17:07.968]  All these other globalists, John P. Holdren, if people actually read what they've said, what they've done, it is over for these people.
[00:17:08.648 --> 00:17:09.549]  Here, I'll read the quote.
[00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:14.913]  The first global revolution, 1991, published by the Club of Rome, a globalist think tank.
[00:17:15.313 --> 00:17:21.017]  In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that population, the threat of global warming, rather
[00:17:21.798 --> 00:17:22.739]  And they go on to say...
[00:17:33.635 --> 00:17:42.602]  That they're going to use fake terror to take our rights on one end and fake environmentalism to take our resources on the other to make us totally bankrupt and dependent on them.
[00:17:42.703 --> 00:17:55.593]  They want you dependent, not so they can enslave you, but so they can kill you with forced inoculations, with poisons in the water, like John P. Holdren calls for, the White House science czar, who's also manipulating the weather.
[00:17:55.873 --> 00:17:57.355]  He admits that to the Associated Press.
[00:17:57.975 --> 00:17:59.236]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:17:59.276 --> 00:18:04.641]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:18:04.882 --> 00:18:09.506]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:18:09.886 --> 00:18:14.971]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:18:15.471 --> 00:18:20.156]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.500]  We're good to go!
[00:18:45.573 --> 00:18:49.301]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:18:49.822 --> 00:18:54.330]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:18:54.651 --> 00:18:57.036]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:18:58.473 --> 00:19:02.734]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.252]  Would it not be nice to have your heartbeat regularly again?
[00:20:07.432 --> 00:20:08.653]  To have a sex life again?

[00:20:57.203 --> 00:21:07.311]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:20.257]  Somebody needs to create a basic site like Expose Gore, Stop Gore, Arrest Gore.
[00:21:22.831 --> 00:21:31.654]  And list all the videos of people confronting him, the articles of people confronting him, and track doing web searches, because Gore won't list where he's going because he's worried about this.
[00:21:32.034 --> 00:21:33.194]  He pulled it about a month ago.
[00:21:33.814 --> 00:21:36.955]  But you can still do Google searches and find out where he's going to be speaking.
[00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:42.497]  They only propagandize locally the media to get everybody to his events so he can indoctrinate them into his new religion.
[00:21:42.857 --> 00:21:45.498]  Our choice, mass murder and tyranny, or freedom.
[00:21:45.558 --> 00:21:46.298]  He wants tyranny.
[00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:52.374]  That way I could link to it and get all of our listeners to go to these events.
[00:21:54.336 --> 00:21:55.337]  But it's already happening.
[00:21:55.477 --> 00:22:02.283]  I mean, but if we start publicizing where he's going, there won't be hundreds, as the media has reported, in some cases protesting him.
[00:22:02.603 --> 00:22:03.724]  There will be thousands!
[00:22:08.189 --> 00:22:12.533]  Oh man, I wish Glenn Beck would do something effective like this and have people stand out in the rain.
[00:22:14.094 --> 00:22:24.817]  And I'm not saying that's bad, but we need to really have thousands of mini-demonstrations, because those then take over all the TV reports, all the print reports, and expose him for what he really is.
[00:22:25.137 --> 00:22:35.440]  And this is, again, the amount of press this gets when 10, 15 people go to a book signing, go in, confront him, mess up his whole agenda, expose the fraud, bring up Climategate.
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.541]  What you saw in that video should be a blueprint of how to do this.
[00:22:39.401 --> 00:22:44.343]  And then yell and scream at him that he's a traitor and a liar and a fraud and a criminal with Ken Lay as he leaves.
[00:22:44.983 --> 00:22:48.044]  Let me tell you, he will suspend his tour very, very quickly if this continues.
[00:22:48.725 --> 00:22:51.926]  And he needs to be in jail for all his crimes.
[00:22:52.906 --> 00:22:56.708]  And this is how you get justice, is going, there's the criminal, there's the bad man.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.122]  Now I want to play this video.
[00:23:00.863 --> 00:23:05.268]  This is not the winning 20 Minutes with the President video from Charlie Sheen's contest.
[00:23:05.288 --> 00:23:07.310]  This is the same guy that made that winning video.
[00:23:08.031 --> 00:23:09.533]  And I love the little pearls of wisdom.
[00:23:09.573 --> 00:23:15.980]  He breaks down the fraud in this graph, this little two-minute video, titled The Global Warming Fraud.
[00:23:18.291 --> 00:23:19.491]  The global warming hoax.
[00:23:19.571 --> 00:23:21.672]  It's up on InfoWars.com if you want to watch it.
[00:23:22.272 --> 00:23:24.053]  But here is that video.
[00:23:24.513 --> 00:23:29.894]  If you haven't heard the latest, global warming has been a scam from the get-go.
[00:23:30.314 --> 00:23:43.078]  All along they have been setting up this global carbon tax as a huge fraud on the American people and the people of the world in order for the UN to move into global governance.
[00:23:44.022 --> 00:23:46.983]  They want to control every aspect of our lives.
[00:23:47.223 --> 00:23:53.746]  So if you're a liberty, freedom-loving American, you're going to get screwed over just like everybody else in the rest of the world.
[00:23:54.106 --> 00:24:00.689]  Now, I decided that I wanted to take a minute to go over the hugest scams they've been perpetrating over the last 10 years.
[00:24:01.089 --> 00:24:04.531]  So why don't we take a quick jump and take a look at some of these, okay?
[00:24:05.051 --> 00:24:08.152]  Let's start with 9-11.
[00:24:08.172 --> 00:24:12.514]  60% of the commissioners say the official story isn't true because that ship is sinking.
[00:24:13.496 --> 00:24:14.236]  War on Terror.
[00:24:14.556 --> 00:24:18.777]  Cooked up decades ago to replace the Cold War to keep the military machine moving.
[00:24:19.537 --> 00:24:20.277]  Afghanistan.
[00:24:20.577 --> 00:24:23.678]  Not about Al Qaeda because CIA created Al Qaeda.
[00:24:23.758 --> 00:24:28.159]  It's about the Caspian Pipeline and protecting the opium poppy fields.
[00:24:29.119 --> 00:24:29.639]  Iraq.
[00:24:29.879 --> 00:24:31.260]  Weapons of mass destruction.
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:32.680]  Need I say more?
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.640]  Housing bubble.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.861]  Real estate only goes up in price, right?
[00:24:37.341 --> 00:24:37.761]  Wrong.
[00:24:37.941 --> 00:24:38.781]  They lied to you.
[00:24:38.841 --> 00:24:42.342]  Now the banks own all the property in this country off of your bankruptcy.
[00:24:43.237 --> 00:24:44.178]  Banker bailout.
[00:24:44.579 --> 00:24:49.865]  Oh, we need the money to save the banks so we can buy up these toxic assets and start lending again.
[00:24:50.245 --> 00:24:51.146]  That's a lie.
[00:24:51.406 --> 00:24:56.532]  They took the money to buy up other smaller corporations and phase out other banks and take control.
[00:24:57.253 --> 00:24:58.234]  Swine flu.
[00:24:58.635 --> 00:24:59.696]  This is insane.
[00:25:00.016 --> 00:25:01.538]  These guys are crazy.
[00:25:01.838 --> 00:25:03.640]  A designer flu created in a lab.
[00:25:04.977 --> 00:25:11.199]  Global warming, the granddaddy of them all, that they were going to use to institute global governance.
[00:25:11.699 --> 00:25:13.459]  I can't wait for this Copenhagen Treaty.
[00:25:13.479 --> 00:25:17.360]  I hope you guys are on top of this, because all of it is a lie.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:18.620]  All of it.
[00:25:20.161 --> 00:25:24.982]  If you want your freedom and you want your liberties, you need to take a look at these and seriously think about it.
[00:25:25.247 --> 00:25:31.755]  You're being lied to and the mainstream media is complicit and they should all be charged with criminal felonies.
[00:25:32.095 --> 00:25:35.659]  They need to be tried as criminals and brought to justice.
[00:25:39.684 --> 00:25:42.127]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:25:48.274 --> 00:25:50.875]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:25:51.276 --> 00:25:56.238]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:25:56.618 --> 00:25:58.339]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:25:58.659 --> 00:26:03.482]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:04.622]  How much do you want?
[00:26:04.842 --> 00:26:05.583]  When do you want it?
[00:26:05.963 --> 00:26:07.564]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:26:07.844 --> 00:26:08.684]  When will you need it?
[00:26:08.924 --> 00:26:10.985]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:26:11.126 --> 00:26:12.226]  Will there be any food?
[00:26:12.466 --> 00:26:13.787]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:26:14.087 --> 00:26:16.368]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:26:16.528 --> 00:26:19.050]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:22.471]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:26:22.831 --> 00:26:26.333]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:26:26.653 --> 00:26:27.634]  How much will you need?
[00:26:27.894 --> 00:26:28.494]  We don't know.
[00:26:28.775 --> 00:26:29.695]  How much do you want?
[00:26:29.895 --> 00:26:30.615]  All you can get.
[00:26:30.816 --> 00:26:31.516]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:26:31.896 --> 00:26:34.678]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:26:34.958 --> 00:26:37.159]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:26:37.199 --> 00:26:38.160]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.321]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:26:39.361 --> 00:26:41.202]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:02.423 --> 00:27:03.064]  Big Brother.
[00:27:03.724 --> 00:27:04.765]  Mainstream media.
[00:27:05.506 --> 00:27:06.587]  Government cover-ups.
[00:27:07.248 --> 00:27:08.069]  You want answers?
[00:27:08.829 --> 00:27:09.710]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:14.074]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:14.595 --> 00:27:18.639]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:19.921 --> 00:27:22.102]  I start thinking about the ClimateGate emails.
[00:27:22.142 --> 00:27:25.324]  We're only a week and a half into this and it's devastating the New World Order.
[00:27:25.664 --> 00:27:36.250]  The key to their whole global taxing system, the heart of the New World Order neo-feudalistic surf eugenics grid being exposed.
[00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:44.034]  I think about Al Gore being eloquently shouted down as a criminal, as a fraud, as a eugenicist kingpin everywhere he goes.
[00:27:44.094 --> 00:27:45.135]  It just makes me happy.
[00:27:50.155 --> 00:27:55.760]  Oh, you know, we've done so much in this audience teaching people how much power they have and showing them how to take action.
[00:27:57.822 --> 00:28:00.444]  And I'm not giving myself credit for this, even though we deserve a lot of it.
[00:28:01.145 --> 00:28:05.729]  I'm trying to show people the power they have and the effect we're having and how much this could grow.
[00:28:05.749 --> 00:28:08.111]  I mean, you think things have grown in resistance.
[00:28:08.131 --> 00:28:11.154]  We've only begun the parabolic rate straight up.
[00:28:12.535 --> 00:28:13.656]  Up, up and away.
[00:28:13.676 --> 00:28:15.338]  In, through and beyond.
[00:28:19.298 --> 00:28:25.983]  I mean, I'm going to keep driving and pushing and hammering as hard as I can, but at this point, I could pretty much walk away from this.
[00:28:27.744 --> 00:28:35.369]  And what we've done just in this audience, with this great audience taking action, is a serious blow to the New World Order.
[00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.652]  So many people have shattered the left-right paradigm.
[00:28:38.912 --> 00:28:40.833]  They understand the globalist system.
[00:28:40.853 --> 00:28:41.994]  They've read their documents.
[00:28:42.494 --> 00:28:45.356]  The explosive growth curve of knowledge is now happening.
[00:28:45.416 --> 00:28:48.739]  I know where that leads, because I've gone down that road myself.
[00:28:51.018 --> 00:28:57.264]  People are becoming enlightened right now, and I can feel the spirit of victory and liberty and freedom rising.
[00:28:59.906 --> 00:29:00.186]  Man!
[00:29:01.508 --> 00:29:02.969]  Surf's up, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:29:03.389 --> 00:29:04.410]  Catch the wave!
[00:29:04.751 --> 00:29:06.052]  Fightin' the New World Order!
[00:29:09.215 --> 00:29:15.441]  Oh man, I'm literally having endorphin right now, which I rarely get endorphin rushes on political issues because I'm just so focused.
[00:29:16.212 --> 00:29:24.858]  But, I mean, all these years, 14 years fighting him, I can't imagine what the adrenaline rush is like for G. Edward Griffin, by the way, who Thursday is going to be in studio with us.
[00:29:26.059 --> 00:29:29.501]  I can't imagine what it's like for people like Bob Chapman.
[00:29:29.521 --> 00:29:34.384]  You know, Charlie Sheen and I talk about the incredible rush we get doing the right thing.
[00:29:36.726 --> 00:29:42.549]  What was that quote that Chris Garcia, winner of the 20 Minutes of the President contest, what was that quote?
[00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:44.791]  He quoted me about
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.281]  There's no rush like fightin' tyranny.
[00:29:49.762 --> 00:29:50.922]  That's not my exact quote.
[00:29:52.043 --> 00:30:01.650]  Can't remember my own quote because this stuff just comes out of me, but... Oh, man, I want to... I need to vacate... There's no high like fightin' tyranny.
[00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:03.751]  Yeah, that's not the exact quote.
[00:30:10.496 --> 00:30:11.117]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[00:30:11.157 --> 00:30:12.798]  It's in the interview with him.
[00:30:14.397 --> 00:30:15.700]  From Charlie Sheen yesterday.
[00:30:16.682 --> 00:30:19.789]  But it's almost more exhausting having this much exhilaration.
[00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:25.613]  Because they're just piles of evil, piles of evidence that these are criminals.
[00:30:25.693 --> 00:30:37.161]  But we'll continue to chronicle their criminal activities, like the Founding Fathers did in the 15 years before the Revolutionary War in 1775, 1776, with their committees of correspondence.
[00:30:37.201 --> 00:30:45.047]  But we're now beginning to transfer and transition away from just exposing them to the public knows they're a bunch of crooks.
[00:30:45.427 --> 00:30:46.668]  How do we bring these people down?
[00:30:46.688 --> 00:30:48.249]  Well, you go out and confront them everywhere.
[00:30:48.329 --> 00:30:49.110]  You shot them down.
[00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:50.570]  You expose them.
[00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:54.732]  You wake up the sheeple that aren't awake, because they're ready to be awakened right now.
[00:30:54.752 --> 00:31:00.474]  I want to go to Mike, Joe, Thomas, Dan, Mike, and others.
[00:31:00.974 --> 00:31:02.474]  They just all ask great questions.
[00:31:02.974 --> 00:31:05.675]  Probing questions that are exhausting to answer, but I'm going to do it.
[00:31:07.236 --> 00:31:11.357]  I'm really exhausted right now, but it feels like I just played a football game and we won.
[00:31:17.645 --> 00:31:21.327]  I'm meeting my cheerleader girlfriend in the parking lot, you know.
[00:31:22.508 --> 00:31:27.491]  But the battle, the battle, the battle isn't over, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:27.511 --> 00:31:29.052]  We're just beginning to win victories.
[00:31:29.532 --> 00:31:31.433]  We're still bloodied and in deep trouble.
[00:31:31.914 --> 00:31:34.655]  And we better treat this like it's life and death, because it is.
[00:31:34.735 --> 00:31:35.736]  But that's the victory!
[00:31:36.076 --> 00:31:39.218]  The people are starting to figure out, this is eugenics we're facing!
[00:31:39.238 --> 00:31:40.639]  This is mass Nazism!
[00:31:40.939 --> 00:31:42.120]  This is New World Order!
[00:31:43.936 --> 00:31:48.239]  They're really starting to get just how monumental and big this is!
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:56.524]  For all of you out there fighting tyranny, I salute you!
[00:31:57.585 --> 00:32:02.768]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:32:02.908 --> 00:32:04.889]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:32:04.989 --> 00:32:07.271]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:32:07.431 --> 00:32:09.292]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:32:09.712 --> 00:32:11.073]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:32:11.333 --> 00:32:12.374]  There is a solution.
[00:32:12.594 --> 00:32:20.620]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:40.093]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[00:33:04.419 --> 00:33:06.401]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:33:06.521 --> 00:33:08.643]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:33:08.763 --> 00:33:10.304]  And it's available right now to you.

[00:33:57.148 --> 00:34:01.369]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:02.310]  Number one.
[00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:05.771]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:34:06.031 --> 00:34:06.611]  Number two.
[00:34:06.891 --> 00:34:11.433]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:34:11.773 --> 00:34:12.233]  It's true.
[00:34:12.533 --> 00:34:17.075]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:34:17.395 --> 00:34:17.935]  Number 3.
[00:34:18.215 --> 00:34:21.497]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:34:21.797 --> 00:34:25.538]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:34:25.718 --> 00:34:26.258]  Number 4.
[00:34:26.518 --> 00:34:28.879]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:34:29.279 --> 00:34:32.661]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:34:32.961 --> 00:34:33.161]  Number 5.
[00:34:33.661 --> 00:34:37.603]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:34:37.803 --> 00:34:42.586]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:34:42.866 --> 00:34:46.888]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:34:47.048 --> 00:34:48.609]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:53.431]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:34:59.378 --> 00:35:05.399]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:35:05.999 --> 00:35:09.060]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:12.421 --> 00:35:17.642]  Our country, and much of the world, was captured by the Global Banking Syndicate a long time ago.
[00:35:20.023 --> 00:35:21.403]  But now the people are
[00:35:22.819 --> 00:35:28.422]  Awakening to the fact that we are occupied by a criminal banking elite that controls both political parties.
[00:35:29.263 --> 00:35:33.566]  So whatever political party is out of power, they will oppose the New World Order, but only on the surface.
[00:35:33.586 --> 00:35:41.750]  And whatever political party is in power, they will continue whatever agenda the last party had, with different political window dressing to create the illusion of choice.
[00:35:44.072 --> 00:35:52.277]  But to see the public shattering this illusion, and to see it like a wild brush fire raging, as Thomas Jefferson talked about, is exhilarating.
[00:35:54.128 --> 00:35:58.351]  I have never gotten a comprehensive list of We Are Change groups and other groups.
[00:35:59.131 --> 00:36:03.454]  They're always contacting us and I have such limited staff, we never save their numbers or info.
[00:36:03.795 --> 00:36:08.598]  I know I've had the Colorado We Are Change on, we've had Florida We Are Change on that have been confronting Al Gore.
[00:36:08.898 --> 00:36:11.400]  We've had Chicago We Are Change, Ohio on in the past.
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.542]  Then we've got to look for their numbers and emails and we can't find them.
[00:36:14.962 --> 00:36:23.568]  If you're We Are Change, and I want to get them on this week, I want to get Luke on with them, do like an hour and a half with the We Are Change groups that have been confronting Al Gore.
[00:36:24.508 --> 00:36:25.790]  I know Luke's number, obviously.
[00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:32.676]  I want to get 5, 6, 7, 8 people on to talk about strategy and future operations.
[00:36:32.756 --> 00:36:35.158]  So email Craig at InfoWars.com.
[00:36:35.779 --> 00:36:36.800]  I've got Craig on this.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:37.981]  We get your numbers and emails.
[00:36:38.021 --> 00:36:39.202]  We can stay in contact with you.
[00:36:39.222 --> 00:36:43.566]  Because what happens is you call us, you email us, and then I think a week later, how do I find their number?
[00:36:43.606 --> 00:36:47.630]  And there's literally 20,000 emails in a week and a half, and I'm trying to find them.
[00:36:51.988 --> 00:36:58.813]  It's kind of like we're kicking the New World Order's hind end in, but their political bodies are stacking up so high we can barely find room to fight.
[00:36:58.833 --> 00:37:00.814]  Because there's so many of them.
[00:37:05.217 --> 00:37:08.459]  All right, I said I'm going to cover all this news, but I also said I was going to take your calls.
[00:37:08.499 --> 00:37:11.001]  So let's continue with your calls right now.
[00:37:11.762 --> 00:37:13.643]  Mike in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[00:37:13.703 --> 00:37:14.123]  Go ahead.
[00:37:15.224 --> 00:37:15.464]  Alex.
[00:37:16.005 --> 00:37:16.325]  Hey, buddy.
[00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:17.935]  Hey, how's it going?
[00:37:18.475 --> 00:37:19.015]  Good.
[00:37:19.976 --> 00:37:20.536]  It's an honor.
[00:37:21.196 --> 00:37:28.958]  I just want to say that the Lyron Chief is going to be in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Friday, December 4th.
[00:37:28.998 --> 00:37:36.901]  He's doing his White House to Main Street tour and I just hope that maybe some of the listeners, like we are, change.
[00:37:36.941 --> 00:37:42.402]  I hope they show up and we get some people down there to maybe, you know, he's supposed to be there all day.
[00:37:43.522 --> 00:37:44.643]  Details are a little sketchy.
[00:37:44.683 --> 00:37:45.523]  I'm trying to figure out.
[00:37:46.175 --> 00:37:52.357]  You know, what his itinerary is going to be, but... And remember, he said he wasn't going to Copenhagen, but now he is.
[00:37:52.377 --> 00:37:53.298]  I know.
[00:37:53.398 --> 00:37:57.919]  They always do that to kill opposition so nobody shows up, then he still shows up himself.
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:08.723]  Well, I hope he's going to show up in Allentown, because I'm going down there, you know, and I hope some people show up with some signs and, you know, call him the liar that he is.
[00:38:08.763 --> 00:38:11.184]  He's got his little press conference tomorrow.
[00:38:11.705 --> 00:38:14.466]  I mean, there's so much that you can get this guy on, it's not even funny.
[00:38:14.506 --> 00:38:15.466]  You know, Copenhagen.
[00:38:16.464 --> 00:38:17.125]  No jobs.
[00:38:18.065 --> 00:38:18.826]  We're losing our houses.
[00:38:18.866 --> 00:38:20.267]  The wars.
[00:38:21.448 --> 00:38:22.709]  Keeping the Patriot Act.
[00:38:22.789 --> 00:38:24.610]  Expanding secret arrest and torture.
[00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:26.331]  Warrantless wiretapping.
[00:38:26.391 --> 00:38:30.194]  Hiring nothing but lobbyists.
[00:38:30.274 --> 00:38:34.076]  Spending more money than all presidents before him combined in less than one year.
[00:38:34.096 --> 00:38:39.300]  I thought that was hard to do with Bush doing it in four years or eight years, you know?
[00:38:41.461 --> 00:38:42.762]  But yeah, December 4th.
[00:38:44.125 --> 00:38:45.205]  Allentown, Pennsylvania.
[00:38:45.225 --> 00:38:45.986]  People show up.
[00:38:47.106 --> 00:38:48.006]  God bless you, sir.
[00:38:48.086 --> 00:38:48.546]  Take care.
[00:38:48.887 --> 00:38:52.928]  And there'll be a lot of people out there protesting him, but don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[00:38:52.968 --> 00:39:01.511]  Just get out there, and if you're one person, a minority of one is a majority morally, and you'll end up being in the paper.
[00:39:02.271 --> 00:39:07.392]  Again, if we don't go out and confront these liars, they have the field to themselves.
[00:39:07.793 --> 00:39:09.333]  Resistance is victory.
[00:39:09.373 --> 00:39:11.934]  I hate to sound like a broken record here, but
[00:39:13.715 --> 00:39:15.636]  Joe in Illinois, you're on the air, Joe.
[00:39:16.377 --> 00:39:17.497]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[00:39:17.938 --> 00:39:23.101]  What did you think of that audio slash video we just played of Al Gore being routed like the pig he is?
[00:39:23.641 --> 00:39:24.582]  Hey, God bless.
[00:39:24.642 --> 00:39:26.443]  We are Chicago, those brothers.
[00:39:26.463 --> 00:39:29.325]  I want to get with them next time they do something like that.
[00:39:29.505 --> 00:39:30.746]  Yes, that's how it works.
[00:39:30.866 --> 00:39:31.666]  Join with them.
[00:39:32.267 --> 00:39:32.647]  Yeah.
[00:39:33.247 --> 00:39:41.993]  But anyway, I'm a first time caller, longtime listener, and I've kind of took all the knowledge I've gained from listening to your show.
[00:39:42.665 --> 00:39:46.526]  And put it in the form of this, uh, poetic literature.
[00:39:46.966 --> 00:39:51.307]  Feel free to use it, or even, you said Dave Mustaine from Megadeth?
[00:39:51.867 --> 00:39:55.088]  I think he would be down with these lyrics that I got here.
[00:39:55.928 --> 00:39:56.428]  Are you ready?
[00:39:56.448 --> 00:39:57.368]  Lay it on me!
[00:39:57.948 --> 00:39:59.468]  Alright, it's called Rulers.
[00:40:00.249 --> 00:40:04.309]  Rulers want to rule the world in the name of the moon and the sun.
[00:40:04.689 --> 00:40:08.410]  In the name of this star, Ishtar, Red Star, Dog Star.
[00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:10.611]  In the name of Mars and Jupiter.
[00:40:10.911 --> 00:40:12.351]  They can't get any stupider.
[00:40:12.918 --> 00:40:15.640]  Pike and Anna Lucius are just a couple of the douches.
[00:40:16.181 --> 00:40:21.685]  Nixon, Hitler, Darwin, Mussolini, Mengele, Kissinger, Kim Jong, and Ben Bernanke.
[00:40:22.225 --> 00:40:24.907]  Eastbound travelers, square men on the level.
[00:40:25.328 --> 00:40:28.850]  Given the chance to rule the world, they make the deals with the devil.
[00:40:29.411 --> 00:40:32.913]  Rothschilds, Rockefellers, the Morgans, and the chases.
[00:40:33.294 --> 00:40:36.036]  Bilderbergers all, whom Satan put in places.
[00:40:36.636 --> 00:40:42.721]  Stalin, Osama, Obama, Gaddafi, Black Pope, White Pope, Mafia, Illuminati.
[00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:50.792]  CIA, OTO, FBI, NWO, ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX.
[00:40:51.032 --> 00:40:52.912]  That's 666, don't you know?
[00:40:53.272 --> 00:40:55.353]  Three-digit code, that's how they roll.
[00:40:56.453 --> 00:41:01.194]  H1N1, HIV, MF-MF59, and LSD.
[00:41:01.694 --> 00:41:04.115]  Hormones in the water, poison in the air.
[00:41:04.935 --> 00:41:07.796]  Mercury in the vaccines, and toxins everywhere.
[00:41:08.596 --> 00:41:12.337]  Places called Bohemian Grove, or the Thousand Points of Light.
[00:41:12.904 --> 00:41:16.506]  It's where they meet with their God to plot their schemes of blight.
[00:41:17.467 --> 00:41:21.649]  They place their credos at the crossroads in plain sight for all to see.
[00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:25.852]  Their evil plans of ruling the world and destroying humanity.
[00:41:26.653 --> 00:41:31.496]  These are the places they bestowed their title, Masters, 33rd degree.
[00:41:32.116 --> 00:41:36.999]  But the light for which they sold their souls was so blinding they could no longer see.
[00:41:37.459 --> 00:41:41.842]  Now they're empty, heartless, broken vessels to which Satan owns the deed.
[00:41:42.657 --> 00:41:45.919]  Angry, evil, wicked men who love to make us bleed.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.982]  These are the men who rule the world and make the policies.
[00:41:50.603 --> 00:41:55.386]  Blinded by the light, feeble-minded Napoleons who can no longer even see.
[00:41:56.126 --> 00:42:03.251]  If rulers didn't rule the world and just left the world to be with disease and unchecked population, destroy humanity?
[00:42:03.271 --> 00:42:06.594]  Or would we just live and thrive in peace and harmony?
[00:42:07.134 --> 00:42:10.036]  Some say a world without rulers would lead to anarchy.
[00:42:10.526 --> 00:42:14.310]  But I believe a world with no rulers is a world where men are free.
[00:42:14.951 --> 00:42:18.034]  Why do you want to take my gun and stick that flu shot in me?
[00:42:18.514 --> 00:42:21.818]  Why must I wait in line to be issued a national ID?
[00:42:22.939 --> 00:42:25.762]  Why must I give my money to an insurance company?
[00:42:26.162 --> 00:42:29.646]  Why can't I just live and die as an American, brave and free?
[00:42:29.666 --> 00:42:31.808]  That's it, brother.
[00:42:32.947 --> 00:42:33.707]  Well, that's beautiful.
[00:42:33.747 --> 00:42:37.509]  You should at least go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:41.911]  A lot of poetry and spoken word gets posted in the comment sections.
[00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:51.695]  And why don't you go post that in the Al Gore video that we have linked up from We Are Change Chicago so people can read that so it has a record there online.
[00:42:51.735 --> 00:42:52.356]  Very beautiful.
[00:42:52.416 --> 00:42:52.896]  Good job.
[00:42:52.936 --> 00:42:53.636]  Good to hear from you.
[00:42:54.197 --> 00:42:55.477]  Let's take another call here.
[00:42:55.537 --> 00:42:57.958]  Let's talk to Thomas in Connecticut.
[00:42:58.398 --> 00:43:01.060]  Speaking of Luciferianism up there by Skull and Bones.
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:02.601]  In New Haven.
[00:43:02.641 --> 00:43:03.141]  Go ahead.
[00:43:03.361 --> 00:43:04.182]  You're on the air, Thomas.
[00:43:04.982 --> 00:43:06.003]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:43:06.323 --> 00:43:06.583]  Good.
[00:43:07.564 --> 00:43:09.065]  Listen, I'm a new listener.
[00:43:09.105 --> 00:43:17.370]  I've been listening for a couple of weeks now, and I want to say that I'm... First off, I want to thank you very much for this alternative that you've given to the regular news.
[00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:28.297]  I've been listening, obviously, to the regular news channels, ABC, CBS, NBC, for years, and I've been involved in politics, and I've been looking at the left-right paradigm you talk about so often.
[00:43:29.037 --> 00:43:30.558]  It just doesn't make sense to me.
[00:43:30.598 --> 00:43:31.319]  When I look at the left,
[00:43:32.054 --> 00:43:33.475]  I see just ultra-ultra-liberals.
[00:43:34.215 --> 00:43:36.236]  Not entirely, but I see majority.
[00:43:36.256 --> 00:43:45.319]  I look to the right, and I see people that espouse, quote, free markets and so forth, like Limbaugh.
[00:43:46.179 --> 00:43:49.181]  But they talk nothing about protection for the people.
[00:43:49.681 --> 00:43:51.822]  And I'm for the middle road.
[00:43:52.022 --> 00:43:54.062]  I mean, I'm an attorney.
[00:43:54.262 --> 00:43:57.804]  I've studied the classics in politics and government in college.
[00:43:58.826 --> 00:44:12.478]  To me it makes, you know, you're the first person, and I can't say I agree with you on everything yet, because I have not only listened to you for two weeks, but there's been nothing, or not nothing, but there's been not a lot of what you've been putting out there that makes a whole lot of sense.
[00:44:13.299 --> 00:44:25.390]  And listening to you as a new listener, I've been listening to it, and my family can attest to it voraciously for the past couple of weeks, because I guess while I don't give you an example, for instance, 9-11, I can't say that.
[00:44:26.681 --> 00:44:33.886]  I think I'm scared to look at the literature because I would have a hard time believing that it's a hoax, even if confronted with the truth.
[00:44:33.926 --> 00:44:41.092]  Sir, all we ask you to do is to start questioning everything you're told and start looking into things for yourself.
[00:44:42.512 --> 00:44:54.394]  The Republican and Democratic parties have some good people in both parties, but the leadership give you two different brands, two different roads that lead the same place, consolidation of power, collectivism.
[00:44:55.175 --> 00:44:56.655]  Bush quadruples government.
[00:44:57.195 --> 00:44:59.315]  Obama is even worse than that.
[00:44:59.976 --> 00:45:07.277]  So the Republicans are driving at 10 miles an hour towards the cliff and Obama's driving at 20 miles an hour on some issues.
[00:45:08.097 --> 00:45:11.958]  On some issues, the Republicans are driving faster over the cliff than the Democrats.
[00:45:14.176 --> 00:45:19.823]  Any big government is going to be taken over by private corporate criminal interests and is going to be used to rape you.
[00:45:20.864 --> 00:45:22.566]  And so we've got to shrink government.
[00:45:22.606 --> 00:45:24.248]  We're bankrupt any way you cut it.
[00:45:24.969 --> 00:45:26.271]  And it's been done by design.
[00:45:26.311 --> 00:45:30.916]  But even if you don't believe it's been done by design, if you don't read their own literature, still it's too big.
[00:45:30.976 --> 00:45:31.597]  It's out of control.
[00:45:33.567 --> 00:45:44.154]  I'm not against illegal aliens, they're just good, hard-working people, but we can't have billions of third-worlders coming here with a socialist system because it will bankrupt everything.
[00:45:44.415 --> 00:45:49.778]  So I'm not against the illegals, but I'm against how they're being used to drive down wages and bring in a new world order.
[00:45:50.739 --> 00:45:57.604]  But see, the left just says, no, all illegals are great, and the right, you know, comes out and kind of whitewashes that.
[00:45:59.079 --> 00:46:02.582]  It's all controlled, sir, and I hope that answers your question.
[00:46:02.622 --> 00:46:04.824]  I mean, the world is sophisticated.
[00:46:05.584 --> 00:46:08.607]  And if there's any message, that's the message I'm trying to get out to people.
[00:46:10.088 --> 00:46:12.630]  Well, you have gotten that message out to me, and I want to say that
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:20.844]  Well, I've been unable to, I mean, I've been satisfied, I've been listening to you, I'm going to continue to listen to you, because I'm getting answers.
[00:46:20.864 --> 00:46:22.344]  Do I believe the whole climate gate?
[00:46:22.464 --> 00:46:22.985]  Absolutely.
[00:46:23.065 --> 00:46:24.685]  You're spot on on that.
[00:46:24.705 --> 00:46:31.009]  Well, I mean, to stop my opinion, I mean, they admit the emails are real, and it's the head climatology organization, and they've been caught red-handed.
[00:46:31.969 --> 00:46:34.791]  I mean, it's like Ronald Reagan said, trust but verify.
[00:46:35.671 --> 00:46:43.175]  Sir, if you look at 9-11, it's admitted that the hijackers were given high-level security clearances and trained at bases.
[00:46:44.244 --> 00:46:47.466]  Six of the ten commissioners say the whole thing was a whitewash and a cover-up.
[00:46:47.926 --> 00:46:48.567]  Game over!
[00:46:48.587 --> 00:46:50.528]  9-11 is a fraud.
[00:46:50.568 --> 00:46:55.391]  We can debate exactly what happened there, but we know the official story is a giant fraud.
[00:46:55.871 --> 00:46:57.072]  We'll be back with more calls.
[00:46:58.092 --> 00:47:06.857]  From the company that brought you solar and preparedness quality you can bet your life on for over 15 years, now comes the best sale ever on Mountain House Foods.

[00:47:57.531 --> 00:47:59.552]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:47:59.712 --> 00:48:00.472]  Spy on me?
[00:48:00.572 --> 00:48:00.852]  Yeah.
[00:48:00.892 --> 00:48:05.794]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:48:05.935 --> 00:48:07.415]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:48:07.555 --> 00:48:08.216]  Startpage?
[00:48:08.316 --> 00:48:08.656]  Yeah.
[00:48:08.736 --> 00:48:09.716]  Startpage.com.
[00:48:09.816 --> 00:48:12.638]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:48:12.778 --> 00:48:16.499]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.

[00:48:19.781 --> 00:48:22.122]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:48:22.402 --> 00:48:23.863]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:48:24.003 --> 00:48:24.223]  Right!

[00:48:57.330 --> 00:49:03.534]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:49:04.014 --> 00:49:11.779]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:20.005]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:49:20.285 --> 00:49:25.048]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:49:25.368 --> 00:49:30.091]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:49:30.592 --> 00:49:34.454]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:49:34.954 --> 00:49:35.955]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:49:36.035 --> 00:49:40.118]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:49:40.538 --> 00:49:44.921]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:49:45.441 --> 00:49:48.003]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:51:03.737 --> 00:51:09.160]  Some folks are born, silver spoon in their hand.
[00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:17.485]  Some folks are born, made to wait to fly.
[00:51:17.505 --> 00:51:19.386]  The red, white, and blue.
[00:51:19.766 --> 00:51:21.507]  The red, white, and blue.
[00:51:22.408 --> 00:51:29.311]  And when the band plays, hell to the chief lord knows, they point the cannon at you.
[00:51:32.533 --> 00:51:42.043]  It ain't me, it ain't me, no I ain't no sinner's son It ain't me, it ain't me, no I ain't no fortunate one
[00:51:55.270 --> 00:52:18.483]  Alright, I'm going to take some more calls and I'm doing a big news blitz when we start the next segment.
[00:52:18.503 --> 00:52:21.165]  I'm going to continue with your calls throughout the broadcast.
[00:52:23.493 --> 00:52:27.276]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in California.
[00:52:27.436 --> 00:52:28.357]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:52:28.397 --> 00:52:28.837]  Go ahead.
[00:52:28.857 --> 00:52:30.839]  Two things, Alex.
[00:52:31.099 --> 00:52:35.002]  A message to the Truth Movement and a question on Lindsey Williams.
[00:52:37.244 --> 00:52:40.146]  The spirit of John the Baptist is alive and well, man.
[00:52:41.247 --> 00:52:43.889]  The voice of many crying in the wilderness.
[00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:49.394]  The tip of the spear has borne many children, and one of those children is we are changing.
[00:52:49.434 --> 00:52:50.815]  Look what they are doing, man.
[00:52:51.656 --> 00:52:54.438]  That was intense, very intense.
[00:52:54.458 --> 00:52:57.040]  Oh, the power, the power of truth, the righteousness.
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:02.283]  It's really, I mean, that really buoyed me watching that video.
[00:53:03.023 --> 00:53:08.207]  It's because of us that this swine flu scam has taken a flop over dead.
[00:53:08.547 --> 00:53:10.308]  And they admit that in mainstream media.
[00:53:10.348 --> 00:53:12.730]  They say the public isn't buying it, doctors aren't buying it.
[00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:15.451]  We're having victory, victory, victory, victory.
[00:53:15.772 --> 00:53:17.633]  We can be reprieved like Nineveh.
[00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:18.930]  That's right.
[00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:26.835]  It's hard for some of us to see the forest for the trees, but it seems like everywhere we go, people are privy to what's going on.
[00:53:27.295 --> 00:53:43.925]  There have been many battles in history where one group outnumbered the other group 2, 3, 4, 5, even 10 to 1, but because one group understood the art of war and to never give up and had the spirit, they would beat the larger group because the larger group would feel like they were losing.
[00:53:44.406 --> 00:53:46.307]  So much of this is psychological.
[00:53:47.182 --> 00:53:50.524]  Arrest Al Gore and give We Are Change a Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:53:50.984 --> 00:53:51.685]  Absolutely.
[00:53:52.625 --> 00:53:53.325]  Absolutely.
[00:53:54.146 --> 00:53:56.527]  Lindsey Williams.
[00:53:57.288 --> 00:54:02.911]  The reason he gave for the drop of the price of oil per barrel was that
[00:54:03.581 --> 00:54:08.042]  To bankrupt Dubai, he said that a year ago on this show, and it happened.
[00:54:08.142 --> 00:54:10.983]  I mean, look, I know the CEO he's talking to.
[00:54:11.543 --> 00:54:18.444]  He's a retired CEO of one of the big five at the time, and everything he gets is directly from the New World Order.
[00:54:19.484 --> 00:54:20.064]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:54:20.825 --> 00:54:21.625]  Thank you so much.
[00:54:21.645 --> 00:54:22.685]  Yeah, it's powerful info.
[00:54:22.745 --> 00:54:24.045]  Look, Lindsey isn't playing games.
[00:54:25.265 --> 00:54:25.906]  I know the names.
[00:54:27.286 --> 00:54:32.387]  He didn't volunteer them because that was his source, but he said, yeah, you're right.
[00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:39.893]  Because see, he did say the name over 10 years ago in an interview when it wasn't a secret.
[00:54:41.553 --> 00:54:42.634]  So I have a memory.
[00:54:42.814 --> 00:54:43.734]  So I know who it is.
[00:54:45.194 --> 00:54:47.595]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[00:54:47.715 --> 00:54:48.875]  Mike in California.
[00:54:49.216 --> 00:54:52.136]  Or California as the usurper calls it.
[00:54:52.176 --> 00:54:52.757]  Go ahead, Mike.
[00:54:54.357 --> 00:54:55.217]  Mike just dropped.
[00:54:55.317 --> 00:54:56.318]  Bonnie in New York.
[00:54:56.378 --> 00:54:57.238]  Bonnie, come ahead.
[00:54:57.558 --> 00:54:57.898]  There.
[00:54:57.978 --> 00:54:59.259]  Hello, hello, hello.
[00:54:59.619 --> 00:55:00.159]  Hello, Alex.
[00:55:00.719 --> 00:55:01.319]  How are you?
[00:55:01.599 --> 00:55:02.080]  Good, Bonnie.
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:03.440]  Are you taking care of that cold?
[00:55:04.079 --> 00:55:04.779]  I don't have it anymore.
[00:55:04.799 --> 00:55:05.820]  Drink some colloidal silver.
[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.041]  Right here, baby.
[00:55:07.061 --> 00:55:07.961]  You've been drinking this.
[00:55:07.981 --> 00:55:09.662]  I sent you some healing energy.
[00:55:10.282 --> 00:55:11.063]  Did you feel it?
[00:55:11.763 --> 00:55:12.123]  Feel it.
[00:55:13.264 --> 00:55:13.944]  Good, good.
[00:55:14.284 --> 00:55:23.529]  You know, this is going to be our prescription for fighting the tyranny.
[00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:26.030]  Collective mindset.
[00:55:27.431 --> 00:55:28.071]  Third eye.
[00:55:29.912 --> 00:55:31.913]  Okay, we're fighting a spiritual war.
[00:55:31.953 --> 00:55:32.954]  It's a wavelength war.
[00:55:34.338 --> 00:55:40.022]  Everybody's got to go inside and focus totally on the truth.
[00:55:40.042 --> 00:55:44.124]  But then you've got to manifest that on the street.
[00:55:45.205 --> 00:55:46.286]  How are we going to do that?
[00:55:47.306 --> 00:55:48.087]  Little steps.
[00:55:48.387 --> 00:55:49.908]  Little steps.
[00:55:49.948 --> 00:55:51.249]  That's how big steps start.
[00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:52.930]  You know how we do it, Alex?
[00:55:54.271 --> 00:56:00.035]  The other day, my husband's a physician and he's been taking care of people for almost 50 years.
[00:56:01.235 --> 00:56:02.636]  And he's a legend in our town.
[00:56:02.696 --> 00:56:03.537]  He's a great healer.
[00:56:05.147 --> 00:56:11.189]  Interestingly enough, grandparents on all sides, and father was a mason, but he declined.
[00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:15.230]  He became a free man, not a free mason.
[00:56:17.531 --> 00:56:22.773]  And he's been in the business of healing people, and just the other day he was on call over the weekend.
[00:56:22.873 --> 00:56:29.875]  He's 81 years old, and he's given away more free care in our country, in my city, my town, than any other doctor we know.
[00:56:30.895 --> 00:56:32.936]  Anyways, I didn't call to talk about him, but
[00:56:33.715 --> 00:56:34.336]  We'll stay there.
[00:56:34.356 --> 00:56:39.401]  I'm going to come back to you real fast, Bonnie, and then we'll take a few more calls, and I'm going to go over this news.
[00:56:39.421 --> 00:56:43.425]  A lot of news I haven't gotten to, but I wanted to take calls in the first half of the show.
[00:56:44.046 --> 00:56:44.806]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:44.847 --> 00:56:45.227]  Stay there.
[00:56:47.649 --> 00:56:48.550]  We're on the march.
[00:56:49.031 --> 00:56:50.633]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:56:51.573 --> 00:56:54.256]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:58.052 --> 00:57:03.234]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.

[00:57:56.994 --> 00:58:04.457]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:58:04.737 --> 00:58:09.999]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for $6 or the book for $10.
[00:58:10.819 --> 00:58:13.440]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:19.706]  Here's what you do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:58:20.066 --> 00:58:23.910]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:29.496]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:58:29.736 --> 00:58:31.578]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:58:31.818 --> 00:58:33.239]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:58:33.579 --> 00:58:35.821]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:58:36.101 --> 00:58:40.465]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:58:40.825 --> 00:58:44.208]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[00:58:44.548 --> 00:58:47.171]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:58:47.671 --> 00:58:49.092]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:58:49.553 --> 00:58:51.674]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:58:57.873 --> 00:59:01.556]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:59:01.897 --> 00:59:04.899]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:59:05.139 --> 00:59:09.903]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:09.923 --> 00:59:16.169]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:16.329 --> 00:59:18.571]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:19.071 --> 00:59:19.371]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:19.391 --> 00:59:19.812]  Bernanke?
[00:59:19.912 --> 00:59:20.673]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:20.713 --> 00:59:21.854]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:21.874 --> 00:59:24.116]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:41.912]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:59:42.372 --> 00:59:44.953]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:45.273 --> 00:59:54.376]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:00:09.235 --> 01:00:36.088]  I wish a buck was still silver It was back when the country was strong Back before Elvis And before the Vietnam War came along Before the Beatles and yesterday
[01:00:39.176 --> 01:00:43.099]  When a man could still work, still would.
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:52.186]  Is the best of the free life behind us now?
[01:00:52.646 --> 01:00:58.051]  And are the good times really over for good?
[01:00:58.231 --> 01:01:08.399]  And are we rolling downhill like a snowball headed for hell?
[01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:19.075]  That's Merle Haggard.
[01:01:45.731 --> 01:01:48.332]  Think of what globalization has done to this country.
[01:01:49.792 --> 01:01:55.834]  Think about what all the New World Order's activities have produced.
[01:01:56.654 --> 01:01:59.114]  And ask yourself, do we want even more of this?
[01:01:59.214 --> 01:02:01.715]  Ten times what we've already enjoyed?
[01:02:01.735 --> 01:02:05.556]  No, I've enjoyed as much of this as I can stand.
[01:02:06.926 --> 01:02:12.849]  And I'm a free man, I'm not a slave to these offshore banks and all their fraud and all their criminality and I'm standing up against them.
[01:02:13.349 --> 01:02:18.191]  Okay, real fast, Bonnie in New York, finish up the point you were making.
[01:02:18.771 --> 01:02:30.196]  Well, I just, the point I want to make ultimately, Alex, and it wasn't about my wonderful husband who's my hero, but... Sure.
[01:02:30.956 --> 01:02:33.838]  The point of the matter is, there are good guys out there, okay?
[01:02:34.078 --> 01:02:49.751]  I've seen your website, I've been posting, I know all about how the media is using people for their agenda, and they've manipulated events for their agenda, and we see the evil in the world, but there's good out there, okay?
[01:02:49.791 --> 01:02:50.371]  Good people.
[01:02:51.372 --> 01:02:59.018]  And right now what's going on is there's a liberation, okay, from the mental and emotional influences of the past.
[01:02:59.038 --> 01:03:00.619]  There's a spiritual struggle going on.
[01:03:01.181 --> 01:03:02.862]  Alright, listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:31.921]  That's a complex issue.
[01:03:32.861 --> 01:03:36.763]  Because as Gilbert Griffin states correctly, we need to have the long view of history.
[01:03:38.264 --> 01:03:42.647]  And we need to get in positions of power ourselves, constitutional positions.
[01:03:43.587 --> 01:03:54.233]  And as individual citizens, we have that power as sovereigns to say no to these usurpations, the usurpers, the conquerors, the illegitimate pirates taking over our society.
[01:03:55.374 --> 01:03:57.615]  But I agree with you about the hierarchy of needs.
[01:04:00.566 --> 01:04:03.507]  You own stuff, stuff doesn't own you.
[01:04:03.967 --> 01:04:08.228]  You don't cheat, or steal, or hurt people for stuff.
[01:04:09.788 --> 01:04:12.908]  That's why my car gets keyed really bad.
[01:04:13.329 --> 01:04:14.249]  I'm like, so what?
[01:04:15.929 --> 01:04:19.410]  Or somebody backs into it in a parking lot, I'm like, eh, I might fix that in a year.
[01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:25.371]  I like having a car that starts, that has a good safety cage,
[01:04:26.539 --> 01:04:35.221]  That won't break down on the side of the road, but my wife's not materialistic, but she'll say, why don't you clean all the bird crap off your car?
[01:04:35.902 --> 01:04:37.402]  But you haven't cleaned that car in a year.
[01:04:38.422 --> 01:04:42.063]  So I almost go to the far extreme of not caring about things.
[01:04:42.123 --> 01:04:43.344]  Things to me are tools.
[01:04:44.224 --> 01:04:51.030]  But there's also, and I'm not saying you're doing this, but for other people, in the same vein of what you're discussing, kind of an extreme New Age idea.
[01:04:51.050 --> 01:05:03.701]  And India, it's nothing new about it, has that idea, where some of these yogis sit there under a tree, homeless, because they're in bliss, they're in nirvana, they're in Valhalla, they're in heaven mentally, spiritually.
[01:05:04.062 --> 01:05:06.744]  And so why should they get up or get involved or help anybody?
[01:05:06.784 --> 01:05:10.968]  Because they can mentally transfer themselves somewhere.
[01:05:12.199 --> 01:05:17.681]  So too much of an extreme of that mindset gives you a Calcutta, a living hell.
[01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:23.143]  Take Mexico, incredibly smart, hardworking, neat, inventive people.
[01:05:25.503 --> 01:05:27.164]  But there's an attitude of, so what?
[01:05:27.244 --> 01:05:29.305]  I'll just be lazy because the whole system's corrupt.
[01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:30.545]  Somebody will just take it from me.
[01:05:30.605 --> 01:05:31.725]  I'll do it manana.
[01:05:31.745 --> 01:05:39.788]  I'll take a siesta.
[01:05:41.789 --> 01:05:44.391]  To where Mexico can't ever seem to get anything done.
[01:05:44.871 --> 01:05:47.473]  And they let the corrupt elite run their system.
[01:05:50.996 --> 01:05:57.061]  But I do understand what you're talking about, about changing our mindsets to go out and have courage and stand up against corruption.
[01:05:57.101 --> 01:06:04.907]  But I think just magically changing your mindset, the proof of the mindset, the proof of the change, is the action you then take.
[01:06:05.007 --> 01:06:07.109]  As Gandhi said, be the change you want to see in the world.
[01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:12.991]  India was easy to take over because people had a lay down and take it attitude.
[01:06:13.311 --> 01:06:15.472]  As soon as they quit having that attitude, it was over.
[01:06:15.812 --> 01:06:18.813]  As soon as they stopped drinking the Kool-Aid.
[01:06:19.113 --> 01:06:24.635]  Now, I want to shift gears now and cover the news.
[01:06:27.415 --> 01:06:31.217]  And then we have a bunch of video and audio clips and other news I'm going to be covering the next hour.
[01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:32.597]  We'll continue with your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:06:39.124 --> 01:06:48.270]  But before I go any further, before this show runs out in an hour and 20 minutes from now, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[01:06:48.871 --> 01:06:50.132]  You know, speaking of materialism...
[01:06:52.267 --> 01:06:54.548]  It's making materialism your god that's bad.
[01:06:55.028 --> 01:07:11.991]  It's having a fancy car and a new big screen TV, but your children are drinking tap water filled with hundreds of deadly chemicals put in the water to hurt their fertility and to brain damage them and give them leukemia and to give them diabetes and to give them bone cancer.
[01:07:13.492 --> 01:07:17.533]  What John P. Holdren calls for, drugging the water supply to sterilize you.
[01:07:17.813 --> 01:07:18.573]  They are doing it.
[01:07:20.046 --> 01:07:23.167]  But people's priority is to go to the football game and get drunk.
[01:07:23.407 --> 01:07:38.713]  Their priority is to go spend $100 a night at the bar buying their buddies drinks instead of supporting this radio show, instead of supporting Ron Paul, instead of supporting themselves or giving their children true organic food.
[01:07:39.414 --> 01:07:40.394]  It's priorities!
[01:07:43.410 --> 01:07:48.712]  The materialism of all the firearms I own isn't, oh, I go pet them and, oh, I have all these guns.
[01:07:49.112 --> 01:07:52.053]  It's the right of a free man to be armed, and I own guns.
[01:07:53.473 --> 01:08:09.378]  When I buy gold or silver and make quadruple profits because I knew what was coming, because I could read the Globalist-owned documents, it wasn't so I could go to a safety deposit box and open a little drawer of gold and sit there and go, gold, and play with it with my hands.
[01:08:09.758 --> 01:08:12.999]  It's so I've got an emergency backup for my family in this operation.
[01:08:14.761 --> 01:08:16.383]  I'm going off into a rant about this.
[01:08:16.984 --> 01:08:19.907]  The point is, these sponsors are important and people need to support them.
[01:08:21.488 --> 01:08:26.134]  Because raising your consciousness level isn't going to do jack squat about deadly fluoride in your body.
[01:08:26.534 --> 01:08:28.036]  But I do agree with much of what you're saying, ma'am.
[01:08:29.853 --> 01:08:31.413]  Acolablue.com.
[01:08:32.114 --> 01:08:36.755]  Did you know you can be drinking fresh, clean water made right from the air you breathe?
[01:08:36.795 --> 01:08:38.675]  No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[01:08:39.316 --> 01:08:43.477]  Our sponsor, Acolablue, with the Acolablue 28 machine, will allow you to do just that.
[01:08:43.517 --> 01:08:45.497]  It's easy to use and it will make up to 7.5 gallons a day of water.
[01:08:47.958 --> 01:08:56.069]  The water once generated passes through a seven-stage filtering process, including reverse osmosis, carbon filtration techniques, ensuring that you know exactly what you are drinking.
[01:08:56.089 --> 01:08:57.571]  No chemicals, pollutants, or fluoride.
[01:08:58.112 --> 01:08:59.894]  We spend so much time talking about on the show.
[01:08:59.934 --> 01:09:04.340]  Get your very own source of unlimited, renewable drinking water for you and your families today.
[01:09:04.941 --> 01:09:07.243]  By visiting them on the website of coloblue.com.
[01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:09.824]  That's E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[01:09:10.345 --> 01:09:14.127]  Or by clicking on their banner on infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or give them a call at 800-691-6043.
[01:09:14.147 --> 01:09:14.187]  800-691-6043.
[01:09:14.207 --> 01:09:16.409]  One other sponsor I want to tell you about is efoodsdirect.com.
[01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:18.210]  We don't have to remind you that you need food to survive.
[01:09:30.376 --> 01:09:34.539]  Any food's direct is the longest continually operating storable foods company in the country.
[01:09:34.919 --> 01:09:39.602]  They have 10% off for the rest of the month on their already low, low prices of non GMO, non hybrid food.
[01:09:40.502 --> 01:09:44.805]  They also happen to be true patriots and have supported the freedom movement for years and years now more than 20 years.
[01:09:44.865 --> 01:09:52.730]  I know of the looming globalist operations, the swine flu, the talk of wars, depression, the police state, all of this, it's imperative that you
[01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:56.871]  Make sure you and your family are prepared with non-GMO, good, clean, storable foods.
[01:09:57.371 --> 01:10:04.693]  Give them a call today at 800-409-5633, ask for a free brochure, or visit them on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:10:04.713 --> 01:10:08.354]  They got big banners up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:10:08.374 --> 01:10:09.755]  Again, efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:10:09.775 --> 01:10:09.875]  Okay.
[01:10:09.895 --> 01:10:11.335]  Let's go over the news now.
[01:10:24.406 --> 01:10:30.671]  And when I preface a story like this, I don't preface it because I'm scared of the truth.
[01:10:32.192 --> 01:10:35.795]  I don't preface it because I'm trying to win a popularity contest.
[01:10:37.456 --> 01:10:53.728]  I preface it because it's so subtle and so nuanced and so multifaceted and multivariate that if I come out and report this wrong, it will drive people further apart
[01:10:55.586 --> 01:11:00.953]  And will aid the globalists that want to engage in divide and conquer.
[01:11:02.615 --> 01:11:09.183]  But at the same time, it needs to be discussed because there's a media cover-up concerning this, predominantly.
[01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:25.244]  We report on how the mainline Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist organizations are controlled by the federal government, ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, and others.
[01:11:25.284 --> 01:11:31.008]  They've been caught over and over again, not just infiltrating the groups, but captaining them, running them.
[01:11:33.130 --> 01:11:39.935]  And I've had all the chief Nazi websites, with millions of viewers a month, always attack Alex Jones.
[01:11:41.456 --> 01:11:42.457]  And why do they do that?
[01:11:44.298 --> 01:11:46.899]  They do that because I have a spirit of victory.
[01:11:47.799 --> 01:11:48.759]  I understand we can win.
[01:11:48.919 --> 01:11:51.800]  I spread that spirit of victory infectiously.
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:55.341]  Because I know the power of the people in history.
[01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:58.242]  And I understand that we can't be divided.
[01:11:58.922 --> 01:12:04.464]  We have to be united on the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence against the New World Order.
[01:12:05.104 --> 01:12:07.365]  And when we make it racial or religious,
[01:12:11.488 --> 01:12:21.811]  Then that allows the globalists to divide us and control us.
[01:12:22.291 --> 01:12:30.214]  Under the Constitution, under the Bill of Rights, the minority view, the minority organization is as protected as the majority.
[01:12:30.274 --> 01:12:39.197]  Because in a pure democracy, 51% can vote to kill or enslave or scalp or whatever they want the other 49%.
[01:12:42.099 --> 01:12:56.646]  And the big money banks offshore use the howling mob to be sick on the middle class, which is the hereditary enemy of the elite, because the middle class is educated, informed, healthy, dynamic, upwardly mobile.
[01:12:57.407 --> 01:12:58.667]  That's a major wild card.
[01:12:59.748 --> 01:13:04.310]  But I'm prefacing what I'm going with here because I want to try to give you a bigger picture as I see it.
[01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:05.511]  You can have your own view.
[01:13:08.652 --> 01:13:18.217]  And I knew over the years, and it came out that white supremacist groups in Florida that always attack myself as their number one enemy, they spend more time attacking Alex Jones than they spend attacking Israel.
[01:13:18.257 --> 01:13:19.357]  They claim they hate so much.
[01:13:21.398 --> 01:13:33.204]  And then it came out in the... Oh, what's the big paper in... It came out in a bunch of the papers, but it came out in the Orlando Sentinel last year.
[01:13:33.784 --> 01:13:34.365]  Headline...
[01:13:35.402 --> 01:13:38.725]  Leader of white supremacist organization, FBI informant.
[01:13:39.166 --> 01:13:41.688]  And how they ran it, most of the people in the group were feds.
[01:13:42.009 --> 01:13:48.375]  I've been to protests of the Klan, I've been to protests of the Aryan Nations, and you can look at them, they're cops.
[01:13:49.451 --> 01:13:56.735]  You can look at him, and if anybody was ever the archetypal, you know, genetic look of a Jewish guy.
[01:13:56.815 --> 01:14:01.017]  I mean, here in Austin, they had him here, and it was, you know, the three guys up on stage were Jewish.
[01:14:01.037 --> 01:14:02.198]  I mean, they looked like Howard Stern.
[01:14:03.079 --> 01:14:08.642]  I mean, this was a sickening joke, and I've always pointed that out, and that makes the establishment very, very mad.
[01:14:09.202 --> 01:14:14.105]  Hal Turner, always putting out fake Amaro stories, always putting out fake news.
[01:14:15.453 --> 01:14:16.734]  Always attacking me.
[01:14:17.194 --> 01:14:23.938]  I told you six, seven years ago that guy was a Fed and I only come out and say things like that when I'm sure.
[01:14:24.098 --> 01:14:24.939]  I listened to him.
[01:14:25.839 --> 01:14:26.960]  I knew he was a Fed.
[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:30.662]  Calling for killing judges and calling for doing all this.
[01:14:30.782 --> 01:14:32.443]  I mean, I knew he was a Fed.
[01:14:33.884 --> 01:14:35.045]  Creating list of people.
[01:14:36.846 --> 01:14:39.688]  Now this has come out in the Boston Globe a few months ago, but here it is.
[01:14:39.768 --> 01:14:40.128]  Report.
[01:14:40.268 --> 01:14:41.389]  FBI paid blogger
[01:14:43.949 --> 01:14:45.350]  And that is the headline.
[01:14:45.490 --> 01:14:47.711]  Give me a shot for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[01:14:49.732 --> 01:14:51.313]  This is out of Trenton, New Jersey.
[01:14:52.494 --> 01:14:53.754]  Chicago Tribune.
[01:14:56.556 --> 01:15:00.918]  Also broadcast on WGN Radio and WGN9 TV.
[01:15:02.499 --> 01:15:06.061]  Report, FBI paid blogger and it turns out he is an agent like he said he was.
[01:15:12.011 --> 01:15:21.399]  There are groups of poor, disgruntled white people who go out and who beat up black men or beat up Hispanics.
[01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:24.862]  And those cases do happen, but very rarely.
[01:15:26.023 --> 01:15:33.689]  That said, there is another group openly run by the feds that I must expose because I'm about the truth.
[01:15:34.210 --> 01:15:35.310]  I'm about integrity.
[01:15:38.013 --> 01:15:39.314]  I'm gonna get to black folks in a minute.
[01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:42.591]  But Mecce and La Raza.
[01:15:42.651 --> 01:15:44.072]  La Raza means the race.
[01:15:44.112 --> 01:15:46.073]  And their motto is, for those in the race, everything.
[01:15:46.093 --> 01:15:47.354]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[01:15:47.634 --> 01:15:49.515]  That's literally a Hitler translation.
[01:15:49.796 --> 01:15:51.297]  For the German people, everything.
[01:15:51.377 --> 01:15:53.638]  For those outside the German Aryan race, nothing.
[01:15:55.099 --> 01:15:55.999]  I mean, this is sick!
[01:15:57.211 --> 01:15:59.272]  But they're not just funded by the FBI.
[01:15:59.492 --> 01:16:01.073]  They're funded by Miller Brewing.
[01:16:01.393 --> 01:16:02.894]  They're funded by Anheuser-Busch.
[01:16:02.934 --> 01:16:05.275]  They're funded by AT&T.
[01:16:05.775 --> 01:16:08.337]  They're funded by... I mean, go to their website.
[01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:09.917]  Hundreds of corporate sponsors.
[01:16:10.578 --> 01:16:15.780]  They've got comedians they put on national television constantly invoking race.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.961]  What is behind this?
[01:16:19.582 --> 01:16:20.843]  Divide and conquer.
[01:16:20.863 --> 01:16:23.124]  So I'm going to briefly explain that when we come back.
[01:16:23.804 --> 01:16:25.245]  Then I'm going to get into
[01:16:26.786 --> 01:16:27.907]  Police shootings.
[01:16:29.328 --> 01:16:38.415]  There are black men all over the United States killing cops and attacking whites and Hispanics.
[01:16:41.218 --> 01:16:51.506]  And this latest situation, the suspect they have cornered, they believe went and shot these four cops, he's a suspect, but another person just pled guilty.
[01:16:57.093 --> 01:17:06.837]  There's another report out of Oakland where the man's pled guilty to killing the four police officers.
[01:17:08.978 --> 01:17:12.979]  And the media is not explaining they go out and target white officers and kill them.
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:20.482]  And this is all racially driven and I want to break down where all of this is going if we don't stop it.
[01:17:21.547 --> 01:17:24.829]  This is exactly what the New World Order wants.
[01:17:24.889 --> 01:17:32.853]  But clearly, there are racial attacks by blacks on whites, mainly police officers, going on nationwide.
[01:17:35.254 --> 01:17:36.795]  And I don't believe this is staged.
[01:17:38.376 --> 01:17:39.777]  But we're going to talk about that too.
[01:17:41.852 --> 01:17:44.673]  Because the truth is, human beings are all basically the same.
[01:17:44.933 --> 01:17:45.754]  People are people.
[01:17:46.614 --> 01:17:53.076]  And it's this victim ideology in the Hispanics and the Blacks and the Whites that has us all killing each other and it needs to stop.
[01:17:57.558 --> 01:17:59.579]  When you hear the words water purification,
[01:18:02.697 --> 01:18:03.277]  We're good to go.
[01:18:28.562 --> 01:18:34.745]  With your system purchase, you'll receive a shower filter, a fluoride filter, or two sport Berkey bottles absolutely free.
[01:18:35.005 --> 01:18:44.470]  Big Berkey water filters dot com would like to offer GCN listeners 5% off all ceramic filter systems and ship all orders over 50 dollars free of charge.
[01:18:44.771 --> 01:18:47.092]  Visit Big Berkey water filters dot com.
[01:18:47.312 --> 01:18:50.774]  That's Big Berkey water filters dot com or call 1 8 7 7 99 Berkey.
[01:18:50.794 --> 01:18:51.834]  That's 1 8 7 7 99 B E R K E Y today.
[01:18:58.738 --> 01:19:02.403]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:19:02.764 --> 01:19:05.768]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:19:06.009 --> 01:19:07.411]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:19:08.129 --> 01:19:10.790]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:19:10.810 --> 01:19:17.031]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:19:17.191 --> 01:19:22.713]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:19:22.733 --> 01:19:32.375]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:19:32.495 --> 01:19:34.596]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:19:34.836 --> 01:19:36.156]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:19:36.416 --> 01:19:38.697]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:19:38.877 --> 01:19:40.717]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:19:41.017 --> 01:19:45.798]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:19:46.158 --> 01:19:50.940]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:19:57.222 --> 01:20:01.446]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:20:01.766 --> 01:20:05.850]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:10.634]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:20:13.627 --> 01:20:13.767]  I think?
[01:20:33.801 --> 01:20:37.744]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:20:37.964 --> 01:20:42.727]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:20:43.007 --> 01:20:47.049]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:48.750]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:21:04.198 --> 01:21:27.263]  The news today, oh boy About a lucky man who made the grade And though the news was rather sad Well, I just had to laugh I saw the photograph
[01:21:45.292 --> 01:22:05.544]  Okay, so people are asking, what do white supremacists predominantly run by the government and other private organizations connected to government have to do with Mecha and La Raza, which are thousands of times bigger than the white supremacist organizations that the media says are legitimate, are allowed to be racially based, are allowed to be racist?
[01:22:06.425 --> 01:22:08.386]  What does that have to do with cop killers?
[01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:20.217]  Well, the bottom line is they've got all these racial groups feeling sorry for themselves, feeling victimized, feeling like they have a right to do whatever they want.
[01:22:20.377 --> 01:22:35.527]  And I read every few days in local papers from Texas to California, from Indiana to New York, where Hispanic, MS-13, Mexican Mafia, others go and target blacks mainly and just kill black men on the street.
[01:22:36.668 --> 01:22:38.369]  I mean, every couple of days I read about that.
[01:22:39.673 --> 01:22:41.835]  But it's never called racial, it's called gang.
[01:22:42.817 --> 01:22:44.098]  No, they're targeting black men.
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:47.502]  And there's some targeting of whites.
[01:22:48.062 --> 01:22:52.647]  And the media only hypes it up, though, when whites kill a black person or a Hispanic.
[01:22:53.128 --> 01:22:55.711]  When you look at the statistics, it's off the charts the other way around.
[01:22:56.071 --> 01:23:01.077]  Because these groups feel sorry for themselves and have been taught, Whitey is the reason this has happened.
[01:23:04.002 --> 01:23:07.963]  When the globalists may be predominantly white, but they're poisoning everybody's water supply.
[01:23:08.263 --> 01:23:19.347]  The Federal Reserve is taxing everybody out of existence and shutting down our factories, and trying to force vaccines on all of us, and we better stick together, even if some of you want to kill each other later.
[01:23:20.848 --> 01:23:30.231]  If you want to be ignorant, that's your business, but we might as well get together against the Federal Reserve now, and then you can kill each other later if you're hell-bent on that.
[01:23:31.055 --> 01:23:33.896]  Because the big threat is the scientific dictatorship.
[01:23:34.276 --> 01:23:37.437]  It is the world government, the people that created HIV-AIDS.
[01:23:39.678 --> 01:23:43.319]  You don't hear Jesse Jackson when he's out race pimping talking about that, do you?
[01:23:44.099 --> 01:23:48.600]  You don't hear him talking about Obama doubling the forced abortion money for China and Africa.
[01:23:51.601 --> 01:23:55.302]  Now, without even looking this morning, I googled police shooting.
[01:23:56.103 --> 01:24:00.484]  And I found three articles about black men shooting or allegedly shooting police.
[01:24:01.854 --> 01:24:07.317]  Family accused, family account of Oakland parolee who killed the four police officers.
[01:24:07.357 --> 01:24:08.077]  He's pled guilty.
[01:24:08.778 --> 01:24:19.864]  The Oakland parolee who took the lives of four Oakland police officers knew he was a wanted man and deliberately skipped out on a meeting as part of a feud he was having with his parole agent, his family said today.
[01:24:24.866 --> 01:24:25.967]  Lavelle Mixon.
[01:24:27.328 --> 01:24:28.068]  Now that's Oakland.
[01:24:31.041 --> 01:24:34.445]  I've got another one right here.
[01:24:34.525 --> 01:24:38.130]  Denver police arrest 32 in series of downtown assaults.
[01:24:38.671 --> 01:24:44.277]  They admit in this article, this is the rarity, that it was racially motivated.
[01:24:45.168 --> 01:24:56.292]  The Denver Police arrested 32 men and juvenile boys after a months-long undercover investigation into what police said were racially motivated assaults and robberies in downtown Denver, including the Lodue Entertainment District.
[01:24:56.873 --> 01:25:10.218]  A task force composed of Denver Police, FBI, and Denver District Attorney's Office investigated 26 incidents, that's tip of the iceberg, in which groups of black males verbally harassed, assaulted, and at times robbed white or Latino males, according to Denver Police Chief.
[01:25:10.638 --> 01:25:14.180]  See, that's because it's racially, they think it's okay
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.761]  To do that because, oh, it's whites and Hispanics.
[01:25:18.082 --> 01:25:23.464]  They've been taught through multiculturalism that claims it brings unity that there's all these differences.
[01:25:24.245 --> 01:25:26.086]  That's how the globalists divide and conquer.
[01:25:27.346 --> 01:25:34.050]  And I want to dovetail that when we come back with the latest shootings in Washington State.
[01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:35.550]  The four dead cops.
[01:25:35.570 --> 01:25:36.071]  Stay with us.
[01:25:39.652 --> 01:25:41.213]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:25:46.906 --> 01:25:56.012]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:25:56.052 --> 01:25:59.194]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:25:59.434 --> 01:26:05.137]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:26:05.297 --> 01:26:09.780]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.422]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:26:12.702 --> 01:26:21.789]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[01:26:21.889 --> 01:26:27.293]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.

[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:46.580]  Do it now.
[01:26:50.101 --> 01:26:52.021]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:26:52.501 --> 01:26:55.262]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:27:14.356 --> 01:27:19.737]  So all over the nation, Hispanics are killing blacks predominantly.
[01:27:19.757 --> 01:27:22.518]  Blacks are killing whites and Hispanics.
[01:27:24.364 --> 01:27:25.864]  Everybody's killing Asians.
[01:27:26.044 --> 01:27:27.705]  Asians are killing Asians.
[01:27:27.725 --> 01:27:29.005]  They mainly prey on each other.
[01:27:29.405 --> 01:27:32.806]  Statistically, we have all these FBI Justice Department numbers.
[01:27:32.866 --> 01:27:34.887]  It paints a really dangerous picture.
[01:27:35.847 --> 01:27:50.491]  Meanwhile, the globalists are up there laughing because as this racial crime intensifies, the establishment can run all these ads and government programs speaking out against it, which only adds to the tension.
[01:27:53.482 --> 01:27:57.944]  This is the Defy and Conquer program.
[01:27:58.924 --> 01:28:04.726]  Now, I don't know if this is the case, but he certainly fits the bill with the assessment.
[01:28:06.227 --> 01:28:15.971]  But it turns out that an individual who was pardoned by Huckabee in 2000, and who has been charged with rape and assault on a police officer recently,
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:23.924]  Is the person they believe, he's the main suspect, gunned down four police officers yesterday.
[01:28:23.944 --> 01:28:33.951]  A gunman alleged to have shot dead four police officers was on the run Monday after a house at the center of a tent standoff in Washington State was found to be empty, police said.
[01:28:34.511 --> 01:28:44.478]  After laying siege to the home in Seattle's Lecce neighborhood for 11 hours, police SWAT teams entered the building where convicted felon Maurice Clemons was believed to be holed up.
[01:28:47.332 --> 01:28:48.333]  We have cleared the residence.
[01:28:48.353 --> 01:28:51.855]  Seattle Police Tactical went in and checked the residence.
[01:28:52.155 --> 01:28:53.176]  The suspect was not there.
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:00.440]  And it goes on.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:05.984]  A murder warrant has been issued while a reward leading to Clemons' arrest has been increased to $125,000.
[01:29:06.244 --> 01:29:10.287]  The police don't want to tell you they've got license plate reading cameras.
[01:29:10.307 --> 01:29:12.048]  That's probably how they tracked him so fast.
[01:29:12.668 --> 01:29:13.549]  If he did indeed do it.
[01:29:14.847 --> 01:29:17.529]  You need to let me know you're listening to me.
[01:29:17.609 --> 01:29:19.311]  I understand that you may need some medical help.
[01:29:19.471 --> 01:29:21.733]  One negotiator said through local media.
[01:29:23.674 --> 01:29:24.535]  And it goes on.
[01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:32.563]  It says he was released on bail last week after being held for several months on charges of assaulting a police officer and child rape.
[01:29:33.164 --> 01:29:35.385]  Now, why are potheads kept?
[01:29:35.405 --> 01:29:37.286]  Because they make good workers in the private prisons.
[01:29:37.766 --> 01:29:44.910]  But the government has been caught in government documents before admitting they release violent offenders to go out and create carnage in the public.
[01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:48.132]  Low-level cops don't know this, but the high-level ones do.
[01:29:48.692 --> 01:29:50.553]  So that the public begs for more police.
[01:29:52.322 --> 01:29:53.283]  And what do you expect?
[01:29:53.363 --> 01:29:59.188]  I mean, Huckabee let this guy go after all the horrible rap sheets and things he did earlier?
[01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:06.675]  After his release, Clemons committed two armed robberies and a string of other crimes, which earned him another 10-year sentence.
[01:30:06.695 --> 01:30:16.945]  According to the Seattle Times, Clemons served only part of a 35-year sentence in Arkansas before it was commuted in 2000 when Governor Huckabee sought the Republican presidential nomination.
[01:30:21.226 --> 01:30:23.909]  And I've got here in the article what his previous convictions were.
[01:30:23.949 --> 01:30:24.610]  I don't remember.
[01:30:24.630 --> 01:30:27.893]  I know it was really, really bad.
[01:30:27.913 --> 01:30:31.016]  Will you guys pull that up for me?
[01:30:31.697 --> 01:30:33.038]  I don't want to get it wrong.
[01:30:33.058 --> 01:30:34.220]  It was really bad.
[01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:35.701]  I want to say it was murder.
[01:30:35.721 --> 01:30:38.444]  And Huckabee said because he did it when he was 17, he let him go.
[01:30:40.157 --> 01:30:45.980]  The point is, this guy gets released over and over and over and over again for violent offenses.
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:49.022]  The jails, we have more prisons than any other country in the world.
[01:30:49.082 --> 01:30:51.223]  Even China has a billion, three hundred million.
[01:30:51.243 --> 01:30:52.383]  They have less prisons than us.
[01:30:53.144 --> 01:31:01.728]  I mean, there are people for white collar offenses, petty offenses, cops beat people up, and on squad car video, and then charge them with assault.
[01:31:01.768 --> 01:31:03.209]  The person serves five years.
[01:31:04.609 --> 01:31:07.151]  And all the fake charges you've put out, police,
[01:31:08.581 --> 01:31:15.427]  Packs the prisons full of non-violent people, so real killers are on the loose, like this other guy that killed four cops.
[01:31:17.949 --> 01:31:21.031]  Had all these violent convictions, and you let him go.
[01:31:21.952 --> 01:31:22.853]  The courts let him go.
[01:31:23.073 --> 01:31:27.217]  And then the answer by the media is, oh see, we need more prisons.
[01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:32.541]  See how they do that?
[01:31:33.382 --> 01:31:34.723]  It's all psychology.
[01:31:36.482 --> 01:31:45.446]  See, it's okay when this guy's preying on raping kids and robbing people and shooting people, but now he's killed four cops, allegedly.
[01:31:46.607 --> 01:31:50.429]  So if he gets caught and convicted, they're gonna kill him with lethal injection.
[01:31:52.750 --> 01:31:54.831]  You know, 90% of cop killers get caught.
[01:31:56.742 --> 01:31:57.824]  Can only 10% of people that kill us do?
[01:32:11.462 --> 01:32:12.823]  Food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:13.003 --> 01:32:13.963]  How much do you want?
[01:32:14.183 --> 01:32:14.944]  When do you want it?
[01:32:15.304 --> 01:32:16.904]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:17.205 --> 01:32:18.025]  When will you need it?
[01:32:18.265 --> 01:32:20.326]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:20.466 --> 01:32:21.567]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:21.807 --> 01:32:23.147]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:23.327 --> 01:32:28.410]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:31.791]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:32.191 --> 01:32:35.653]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:35.993 --> 01:32:36.994]  How much will you need?
[01:32:37.234 --> 01:32:37.835]  We don't know.
[01:32:38.135 --> 01:32:39.036]  How much do you want?
[01:32:39.237 --> 01:32:39.978]  All you can get.
[01:32:40.178 --> 01:32:41.019]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:34:57.876 --> 01:35:03.460]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:21.664 --> 01:35:24.424]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:24.464 --> 01:35:27.045]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:35:29.725 --> 01:35:40.607]  I am going to continue with some of the news here, and then I'm going to get into your phone calls.
[01:35:40.647 --> 01:35:45.568]  But first, I wanted to play the first few minutes of my interview with Lord Mocton Friday.
[01:35:46.108 --> 01:35:50.729]  This hour-long interview is just dynamite with so much information.
[01:35:53.212 --> 01:35:58.256]  And it's posted at YouTube, it's posted in higher quality at PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[01:35:58.837 --> 01:36:05.703]  I'm asking everyone to go get the articles that Paul Watson has written, one of them titled, Lord Monckton.
[01:36:06.832 --> 01:36:08.053]  Abolish the UN.
[01:36:08.133 --> 01:36:09.154]  Arrest Al Gore.
[01:36:09.174 --> 01:36:10.976]  And it breaks down all the key points.
[01:36:11.497 --> 01:36:13.118]  It's great to email friends and family.
[01:36:13.138 --> 01:36:18.744]  And it has the hour-long video-slash-radio interview I did Friday with Lord Monk.
[01:36:18.764 --> 01:36:20.365]  I know a lot of you were on vacation then.
[01:36:20.385 --> 01:36:21.967]  A lot of you didn't tune in that day.
[01:36:21.987 --> 01:36:27.612]  It was one of the best interviews I've ever done on the fake man-made climate change, on all of this.
[01:36:28.835 --> 01:36:36.961]  And how important this fight in Copenhagen, Denmark coming up in seven and a half days is that Obama is going to be attending where they're openly setting up world government.
[01:36:37.401 --> 01:36:38.482]  Are we ready with Lord Monckton?
[01:36:39.223 --> 01:36:40.143]  Let's go ahead and roll that.
[01:36:40.403 --> 01:36:40.764]  Here it is.
[01:36:41.684 --> 01:36:48.049]  Campaign last week when it came out those emails were real and I would imagine you were popping some champagne.
[01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:52.392]  Well we've been following the people named in these emails for years.
[01:36:52.832 --> 01:36:57.556]  We thought they were linked and of course these emails establish exactly how they were linked.
[01:36:58.354 --> 01:37:16.485]  And it's very, very interesting because we had suspected there were just about two dozen people who, around the world, mostly this side of the Atlantic and in America, who were putting this global warming scam together and actually driving it, rather than doing what the likes of Al Gore and the politicians do, just drifting along with it because they don't know any better.
[01:37:16.825 --> 01:37:20.027]  These are the people who have known all along that there isn't a problem.
[01:37:29.971 --> 01:37:30.711]  Absolutely.
[01:37:30.871 --> 01:37:33.712]  And this really proves a conspiracy here, doesn't it?
[01:37:33.772 --> 01:37:38.193]  You have called for the prosecution of the climate criminals.
[01:37:38.233 --> 01:37:39.034]  You were the first.
[01:37:39.454 --> 01:37:44.836]  Now many other representatives from Australia to the United States are calling for criminal investigations.
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:38:04.680]  There's going to have to be a criminal investigation by the Information Commissioner, whose job is to make sure that publicly available information is available to the public, and that officials like the creeps in the Climate Research Centre, and their colleagues all over the United States as well, were prevented from
[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:13.426]  Hiding, destroying, tampering with, shuffling away the data which we paid for and it therefore belongs to us.
[01:38:13.486 --> 01:38:15.507]  And they used a series of excuses.
[01:38:15.887 --> 01:38:17.788]  They said, well, it's a Data Protection Act.
[01:38:17.888 --> 01:38:21.451]  They said the data belonged to other countries' weather bureaus.
[01:38:21.631 --> 01:38:23.152]  Hey, this is weather data.
[01:38:23.372 --> 01:38:24.633]  It's not a state secret.
[01:38:25.073 --> 01:38:25.974]  They were trying to say
[01:38:27.665 --> 01:38:29.326]  They were emailing each other.
[01:38:29.346 --> 01:38:33.029]  They were saying, we are not going to give this data to anybody.
[01:38:33.209 --> 01:38:50.362]  They were even saying they wouldn't write any learned papers for journals which required, as part of the peer review process, that all the data and all the computer code and all the intermediate calculations should be shown and archived so that other scientists could check it.
[01:38:50.682 --> 01:38:51.643]  They were determined.
[01:38:52.043 --> 01:38:58.707]  That other scientists shouldn't be allowed to check their work because they knew that they were simply making things up.
[01:38:59.008 --> 01:39:01.850]  These people are financial fraudsters.
[01:39:02.170 --> 01:39:06.793]  They took at least $20 million that we can trace in recent years.
[01:39:07.253 --> 01:39:08.033]  We're good.
[01:39:28.402 --> 01:39:29.903]  Well said, sir.
[01:39:29.963 --> 01:39:32.805]  We're going to come right back after this quick break with a long segment.
[01:39:32.825 --> 01:39:55.980]  I would like to, blow by blow, get your detailed knowledge of this, some of the history, who these people are, what their bigger goals are, and then specifically, right through ClimateGate, all the different sectors of fraud that they have engaged in, like covering up the four-year request, persecuting scientists, colluding to persecute people, which is racketeering, which is extortion,
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:40:00.485]  Fraud, grant fraud, and now their response saying, so what?
[01:40:03.348 --> 01:40:17.096]  Well, for the rest of the hour, Lord Christopher Monckton, third Viscount of Monckton and Wrenchley, worked at the highest levels of the UK government at 10 Downing Street, one of the chief advisors to then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
[01:40:17.757 --> 01:40:21.359]  You can find out more about his bio by visiting his website.
[01:40:21.379 --> 01:40:23.700]  We'll give that out again repeatedly before he leaves us.
[01:40:24.621 --> 01:40:27.002]  But some stations just joined us recapping.
[01:40:27.042 --> 01:40:29.224]  Lord Monckton, tell us about yourself.
[01:40:29.764 --> 01:40:41.791]  You've been talking about this for more than a decade, and now what ClimateGate means, the different sectors of fraud, and how you believe, from your perspective, this should be prosecuted.
[01:40:41.811 --> 01:40:54.598]  For those who haven't come across ClimateGate, this was the release of a large number of emails between about two dozen malevolent, crooked scientists.
[01:40:55.387 --> 01:41:06.621]  Right at the top of the climatological tree, these are the people who between them have conspired to invent and then maintain the scare of global warming.
[01:41:07.515 --> 01:41:29.368]  And the emails came from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Center, which specializes in calculating the global temperature record for the whole world over the last 150 years, since we first began having what one might call global instrumental coverage with thermometers all over the world.
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:36.306]  And it's quite a complex process because very few of the temperature stations remain in the same place for any length of time.
[01:41:36.707 --> 01:41:41.471]  They come in and out, some work, some stop working, some don't report properly, some don't report at all.
[01:41:41.491 --> 01:41:46.816]  Whole chunks of Russia disappeared in 1990 when the Berlin Wall came down.
[01:41:46.836 --> 01:41:50.340]  So it's very difficult actually to make sense of all this data.
[01:41:51.132 --> 01:42:04.590]  But unfortunately, what they were doing at the Climate Research Centre, with active assistance from many other climate scientists around the world, was they were simply making up the 20th century record of temperatures.
[01:42:05.083 --> 01:42:05.583]  Thank you very much.
[01:42:21.512 --> 01:42:21.672]  I think?
[01:42:43.692 --> 01:43:00.905]  As we now know, because we've seen their computer code and we've seen their data, they didn't store the data properly, they didn't keep it in an organized form, they didn't know by the end of it what their own computer programs were doing, but they were processing all of the data several times over, and it had become a complete mess.
[01:43:01.205 --> 01:43:07.410]  And essentially, they were simply making up the temperature increases of the last 20 years.
[01:43:07.710 --> 01:43:09.311]  It is simply science fiction.
[01:43:09.611 --> 01:43:10.332]  It's science
[01:43:11.325 --> 01:43:16.829]  Well, expanding on that, and of course you obviously have read the emails, they talk about temperatures are dropping.
[01:43:17.209 --> 01:43:18.110]  How do we fix it?
[01:43:18.150 --> 01:43:18.991]  How do we spin it?
[01:43:19.611 --> 01:43:21.252]  How do we hide the decline?
[01:43:22.693 --> 01:43:33.542]  And then of course there's the whole area of how they're talking about keeping people out of journals, persecuting journals, blocking FOIA requests, working with government officials to block this information from the public.
[01:43:33.862 --> 01:43:35.263]  I mean, this is racketeering.
[01:43:36.030 --> 01:43:36.910]  It is racketeering.
[01:43:36.970 --> 01:43:38.171]  I think it does.
[01:43:38.331 --> 01:43:41.572]  It is nicely covered by your RICO statute.
[01:43:41.933 --> 01:43:46.755]  And funny enough, we have just put a new act on the statute book a few years ago called the Fraud Act.
[01:43:47.255 --> 01:43:52.277]  And this is fraud on our side of the Atlantic and racketeering, as you would call it, on yours.
[01:43:52.537 --> 01:43:56.399]  These are people who deserve to go to prison for a very long time.
[01:43:56.419 --> 01:44:03.842]  And I'll tell you why I'm so angry about it, because this is a point that's nearly always forgotten in all the commentaries about climate change.
[01:44:04.853 --> 01:44:08.496]  Global warming isn't killing anyone, and it isn't going to kill anyone.
[01:44:08.956 --> 01:44:17.443]  What is killing people, and killing them by the million, of starvation, now, is the effect of the global warming scare.
[01:44:18.244 --> 01:44:31.475]  Because many nations, including the United States, have taken up to a third of their agricultural land out from growing food for people who needed it, to growing biofuels for clunkers that didn't.
[01:44:32.077 --> 01:44:38.062]  And that has meant in the last year or two a doubling, and I mean a doubling, of world food prices.
[01:44:38.082 --> 01:44:49.072]  And the World Bank says that nearly all of that doubling of world food prices is directly attributable to the biofuel scam, which in turn is directly caused by the global warming scare.
[01:44:49.472 --> 01:44:53.173]  And government saying, well, even if it isn't true, we've got to take precautions.
[01:44:53.213 --> 01:45:00.596]  But you have to remember, you also have to take precautions to check that the precautions you're taking are not killing people by the million.
[01:45:00.856 --> 01:45:03.396]  Which is what this policy of biofuels is actually doing.
[01:45:04.057 --> 01:45:10.199]  And all of this scare comes out from these idiots and these crooks and these criminals.
[01:45:10.499 --> 01:45:14.440]  I'm very sorry, I'm not kind of keeping my normal calm self here.
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:17.521]  I'm so incandescent with fury.
[01:45:18.061 --> 01:45:27.687]  That these people whom we as British taxpayers and you as American taxpayers have been paying to do this work and we have been trusting them to do it right.
[01:45:28.127 --> 01:45:30.429]  They have simply not only been making it up,
[01:45:31.235 --> 01:45:40.641]  But as you rightly say, they have been tampering with the peer review process, trying to interfere with reviewers to persuade them to pass or not to pass papers they didn't like.
[01:45:41.102 --> 01:45:51.529]  They've been trying to bully journal editors whom they don't like into resigning and getting the boards of the papers to appoint, the learned journals, to appoint somebody else more agreeable to them.
[01:45:51.809 --> 01:45:55.872]  They've been interfering with the process of the UN Climate Panel itself.
[01:45:56.332 --> 01:46:00.855]  By saying in one case, here are two papers we don't like because they show that we're wrong.
[01:46:01.176 --> 01:46:13.484]  We will make sure that these papers do not ever get anywhere near the UN Climate Report for 2007, even if we have to redefine the peer review process in order to do it.
[01:46:16.166 --> 01:46:19.408]  Okay, there is Lord Christopher Monckton.
[01:46:19.448 --> 01:46:22.931]  There are four more parts of that hour-long interview.
[01:46:23.051 --> 01:46:25.433]  They're all posted right now.
[01:46:26.644 --> 01:46:36.792]  At Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, they're posted in the great article, headline, Lord Monckton, abolish the United Nations, arrest Al Gore.
[01:46:37.492 --> 01:46:43.016]  This is powerful information, obviously, and needs to be seen by everyone.
[01:46:43.717 --> 01:46:48.661]  No one can stop you, listeners, if you decide to take action and spread those videos to the four winds.
[01:46:49.181 --> 01:46:55.266]  We'll be right back with more news, your calls, and clips of the Charlie Sheen interview, live from yesterday.
[01:46:58.066 --> 01:46:59.446]  This is Big John Lipscomb.
[01:46:59.787 --> 01:47:03.088]  World government and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching.
[01:47:03.608 --> 01:47:07.829]  The choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow.
[01:47:08.450 --> 01:47:13.491]  I have two solutions for you, so you and your family can stay strong and free.
[01:47:14.132 --> 01:47:16.572]  Patriotfood.com.
[01:47:16.592 --> 01:47:21.014]  135 pounds of long-lasting dehydrated food in 25 varieties.
[01:47:21.694 --> 01:47:26.436]  That's one-fourth the cost of many freeze-dried offers of the same weight.
[01:47:27.458 --> 01:47:33.302]  And survivalistseeds.com, where I just released my best offer ever.
[01:47:33.322 --> 01:47:37.424]  7,000 heirloom vegetable seeds, 30 varieties of vegetables.
[01:47:37.844 --> 01:47:43.708]  That's over four pounds of seed, and I ship it in a time capsule so they will last decades.
[01:47:44.248 --> 01:47:48.071]  And now, you can get a second for a $60 savings.
[01:47:48.571 --> 01:47:52.353]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[01:47:52.893 --> 01:47:55.435]  Anything else is just a copycat.
[01:47:57.208 --> 01:47:59.410]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:47:59.531 --> 01:48:00.852]  November 30th, 2009.
[01:48:01.412 --> 01:48:02.434]  Gold opened this morning at $1173.90.
[01:48:03.034 --> 01:48:08.540]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1208.60, $604.30 for a half-ounce, or $302.15 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:09.441]  That's $1208.60, $604.30, or $302.15.
[01:48:16.738 --> 01:48:30.269]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[01:48:30.349 --> 01:48:38.996]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:48:39.196 --> 01:48:40.157]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:48:40.297 --> 01:48:44.440]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:45.821]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[01:48:45.881 --> 01:48:50.426]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[01:48:50.546 --> 01:48:51.387]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:48:53.789 --> 01:48:56.231]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:48:58.113 --> 01:49:01.777]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:49:01.797 --> 01:49:05.160]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:06.802]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:49:07.478 --> 01:49:10.139]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:49:10.159 --> 01:49:16.360]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:22.081]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:49:22.101 --> 01:49:31.723]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:49:31.843 --> 01:49:33.964]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:49:34.184 --> 01:49:35.525]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:49:35.785 --> 01:49:38.066]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:49:38.226 --> 01:49:40.086]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:49:40.367 --> 01:49:45.149]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:49:45.509 --> 01:49:50.271]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:49:50.511 --> 01:49:54.632]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:49:58.763 --> 01:49:59.844]  This is not a drill.
[01:49:59.944 --> 01:50:01.906]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[01:50:02.446 --> 01:50:04.047]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[01:50:04.348 --> 01:50:11.474]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[01:50:11.574 --> 01:50:15.937]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[01:50:15.957 --> 01:50:18.500]  You'll learn step-by-step battle-hardened techniques.
[01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:21.362]  Where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them.
[01:50:21.402 --> 01:50:22.483]  How to create the perfect
[01:50:22.483 --> 01:50:22.963]  I think so.
[01:50:45.916 --> 01:50:46.957]  Just a program note.
[01:50:47.017 --> 01:50:47.938]  I was wrong earlier.
[01:50:48.078 --> 01:50:48.899]  I was going off the blog.
[01:50:48.919 --> 01:50:52.081]  He got that 95-year sentence, according to CNN, the suspect in the latest
[01:51:14.352 --> 01:51:17.956]  Shootings, the killing of four cops in a suburb of Seattle.
[01:51:20.158 --> 01:51:29.968]  This Maurice Clemens got 99 years in 89 for a host of charges including robberies, burglaries, thefts, bringing a gun to school.
[01:51:30.028 --> 01:51:31.810]  He now has a murder warrant out on him.
[01:51:33.382 --> 01:51:41.024]  And then he had arrest warrants out when he'd been arrested and had been released for child rape, assault of a police officer.
[01:51:41.444 --> 01:51:47.606]  He'd been released from another prison sentence a few years ago for robbery.
[01:51:48.126 --> 01:51:52.047]  I mean, this guy has a rap sheet a million feet long and why was he released from prison?
[01:51:54.827 --> 01:51:55.328]  Oh boy.
[01:51:59.369 --> 01:52:00.729]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:52:02.093 --> 01:52:16.678]  But the establishment statistically releases violent offenders quicker than they release non-violent because they're used by the social engineers to kind of herd the general population into being so terrified they call for more police and more prisons.
[01:52:17.139 --> 01:52:20.780]  We have more prisons than anybody else in the world and we have more crime than many nations.
[01:52:21.929 --> 01:52:24.131]  It's because we are a sick, sick society.
[01:52:24.451 --> 01:52:28.393]  And the highest crime rates are in New York City and Chicago, where you have total gun bans.
[01:52:28.774 --> 01:52:30.375]  Because that's where all the criminals move.
[01:52:30.835 --> 01:52:33.737]  Only law-abiding citizens then follow the unconstitutional law.
[01:52:35.738 --> 01:52:44.024]  Okay, let me get into ClimateGate now, then I'm gonna come back and take phone calls from Robert, Robert, Reid, David, Matt, and others that are patiently holding.
[01:52:45.882 --> 01:52:53.167]  We're going to have more guests coming up this week on ClimateGate, but they announced, oh, we accidentally destroyed all the original emails and documents.
[01:52:53.227 --> 01:53:04.875]  Those are our emails that were stolen a few weeks ago, but they've since stolen by somebody inside, probably, who didn't want to be involved in the criminal activity, because that's in the emails.
[01:53:04.895 --> 01:53:06.015]  People going, this is criminal.
[01:53:06.576 --> 01:53:07.556]  We shouldn't be covering up.
[01:53:07.596 --> 01:53:08.597]  The Earth's getting colder.
[01:53:09.337 --> 01:53:14.501]  This is the head UN climatology unit at East Anglia in eastern England.
[01:53:17.170 --> 01:53:23.172]  But then, oh, it turns out before this even broke, they knew weeks ago it had been taken, so they destroyed it all!
[01:53:23.552 --> 01:53:33.496]  Then they figured out, ooh, that makes us even more obvious to be criminals, and so now because they've been caught engaged in fraud, I'm sure they'll engage in more fraud, and now claim they've released everything.
[01:53:33.976 --> 01:53:44.420]  So, yesterday, the headline in the Times of London, trying to find it here, got so many stacks of notes, kind of out of control today,
[01:53:45.585 --> 01:53:51.791]  The headline was, here it is, give me a close shot on this, Times of London, climate change data dumped.
[01:53:52.071 --> 01:53:56.014]  Oh, we're sorry, it was all erased.
[01:53:56.835 --> 01:54:05.002]  And then now they're saying, oh gee, no, you've got to believe us, we actually do have all of the data.
[01:54:06.513 --> 01:54:08.013]  And we're going to be releasing that now.
[01:54:08.093 --> 01:54:18.056]  But their official story was, oh, we had so much data, we just threw it away, even though it was in the emails and documents, which we know they didn't dump.
[01:54:18.116 --> 01:54:19.336]  Then they claimed it was dumped.
[01:54:19.516 --> 01:54:20.656]  Talk about criminal activity.
[01:54:20.896 --> 01:54:22.517]  Now they're saying, oops, we do have it.
[01:54:23.357 --> 01:54:25.957]  So can we trust these liars to release the real data again?
[01:54:26.318 --> 01:54:32.359]  Well, that'll all be a distraction from their real internal data that's already been leaked, that they confirm was leaked.
[01:54:34.246 --> 01:54:43.275]  And I've noticed phony environmentalists online writing articles about how the emails are fake when the university and when NASA and others admit that these are their emails.
[01:54:45.077 --> 01:54:54.326]  It's kind of like two years ago, neocons were still on the radio saying WMDs were found in Iraq even though Bush admitted that they lied about it and WMDs weren't found.
[01:54:56.148 --> 01:54:57.650]  I mean, how stupid do they think we are?
[01:54:59.377 --> 01:55:06.543]  Well, they're counting on that percentage of the population that isn't really paying attention and just kind of halfway hears it and wants to rationalize and make excuses.
[01:55:06.983 --> 01:55:14.530]  It's kind of like the media says there's no world government, no carbon tax, no new world order being set up, even as world leaders call for it and try to pass it.
[01:55:15.831 --> 01:55:18.593]  Because that's for the mainline public that's dumbed down.
[01:55:19.033 --> 01:55:26.279]  They just put out that lie to neutralize whoever they can, so that when people hear us telling the truth, they think we're the liars.
[01:55:27.130 --> 01:55:29.710]  Well, hey, those emails aren't real.
[01:55:30.111 --> 01:55:30.991]  Saw it on the news.
[01:55:31.371 --> 01:55:33.871]  Hey, the news says polar bears can't swim, Alex.
[01:55:34.531 --> 01:55:38.972]  KXAN locally, three nights ago, had a news report saying polar bears couldn't swim again.
[01:55:39.352 --> 01:55:41.093]  Doesn't matter if that's a complete fraud.
[01:55:41.433 --> 01:55:43.273]  Doesn't matter if they hunt on ice flows.
[01:55:43.593 --> 01:55:46.454]  The media says, not true, polar bears can't swim.
[01:55:46.774 --> 01:55:47.554]  They're all dying.
[01:55:47.954 --> 01:55:49.254]  Doesn't matter if their numbers are up.
[01:55:49.634 --> 01:55:54.055]  A lot of people will still believe I'm lying when I say polar bear numbers have exploded.
[01:55:54.946 --> 01:56:00.796]  They will think I'm lying when I say polar bears are great swimmers and hunt seals and smaller whales out on the ice flows.
[01:56:01.721 --> 01:56:09.208]  But here it is, ClimateGate, University of East Anglia U-turn in climate change row, which means fight in English, I guess.
[01:56:09.908 --> 01:56:23.741]  Leading British scientists at the University of East Anglia who were accused, accused, it's confirmed in their own emails they say they're manipulating it, accused of manipulating climate change data, dubbed ClimateGate, have agreed to publish their figures in full.
[01:56:24.521 --> 01:56:26.063]  Yeah, I wonder what that definition means.
[01:56:27.622 --> 01:56:39.011]  The U-Turn by University follows a week of controversy after the emergence of hundreds of leaked emails stolen by hackers and published online, triggering claims that the academics had massage statistics.
[01:56:39.151 --> 01:56:39.772]  Claims?
[01:56:40.552 --> 01:56:41.853]  This is a whitewash, folks.
[01:56:41.913 --> 01:56:42.474]  It's on record.
[01:56:42.494 --> 01:56:46.317]  Look, climate change data dumped, then they say, oh, no, we have it.
[01:56:47.317 --> 01:56:48.258]  We're on the march.
[01:56:48.719 --> 01:56:50.320]  The empire's on the run.
[01:56:51.241 --> 01:56:53.943]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:56.661 --> 01:57:01.848]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:57:01.968 --> 01:57:06.374]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:57:06.494 --> 01:57:08.357]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:57:08.777 --> 01:57:10.139]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:57:10.399 --> 01:57:11.441]  There is a solution.
[01:57:11.661 --> 01:57:19.665]  InterHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:57:33.591 --> 01:57:39.154]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[01:57:56.618 --> 01:58:05.724]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:58:05.764 --> 01:58:08.906]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:58:09.126 --> 01:58:14.830]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:58:15.010 --> 01:58:19.493]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:58:19.773 --> 01:58:22.135]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:58:22.395 --> 01:58:31.460]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:37.004]  He also recommends ZeoLife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.

[01:58:55.838 --> 01:58:56.279]  Do it now.
[01:58:56.479 --> 01:58:59.421]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:58:59.882 --> 01:59:03.064]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:59:03.505 --> 01:59:07.848]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:59:08.069 --> 01:59:09.510]  These emergency backup systems
[01:59:09.710 --> 01:59:12.192]  Provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:59:12.612 --> 01:59:18.436]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:59:18.716 --> 01:59:21.758]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:59:22.338 --> 01:59:26.741]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:59:27.161 --> 01:59:33.485]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:59:33.725 --> 01:59:35.647]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[01:59:36.147 --> 01:59:38.969]  With a solar power generator from Solution from Science.
[01:59:39.349 --> 01:59:43.412]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[01:59:43.852 --> 01:59:45.533]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:59:45.573 --> 01:59:45.993]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:59:46.013 --> 01:59:46.053]  877-327-0365.
[01:59:46.073 --> 01:59:46.574]  Don't wait.
[01:59:46.634 --> 01:59:47.074]  Call today.
[02:00:07.509 --> 02:00:10.091]  I've got a little bit more on Climategate and the economy.
[02:00:10.631 --> 02:00:12.452]  I'll cover some of that after we take some calls.
[02:00:13.152 --> 02:00:18.235]  Then I want to play the last ten minutes of the Charlie Sheen, Christo Garcia interview yesterday.
[02:00:18.255 --> 02:00:19.416]  It was pretty powerful stuff.
[02:00:20.317 --> 02:00:23.118]  That interview, of course, is posted at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:24.579 --> 02:00:31.383]  Before I go any further, I want to tell you about some of the sponsors that made today's show, radio transmission slash TV transmission possible.
[02:00:31.823 --> 02:00:32.944]  Survival Seed Bank.
[02:00:33.865 --> 02:00:34.885]  SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:00:36.823 --> 02:00:45.770]  In a real food crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[02:00:47.312 --> 02:00:52.136]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds waged by the global elite who want to control us by controlling the food supply.
[02:00:52.176 --> 02:00:53.297]  Governments are storing seeds.
[02:00:53.317 --> 02:00:54.277]  The UN is storing seeds.
[02:00:54.317 --> 02:00:57.300]  Globalists of every stripe are storing seeds near the Arctic Circle.
[02:00:57.340 --> 02:00:57.980]  That's on record.
[02:00:58.661 --> 02:00:59.662]  Why do you think this is?
[02:00:59.862 --> 02:01:00.362]  You know why.
[02:01:00.462 --> 02:01:01.303]  Control and power.
[02:01:01.363 --> 02:01:02.244]  This loses from science.
[02:01:02.264 --> 02:01:05.727]  It's trying to get the seeds out of the globalist hands and into the hands of the people.
[02:01:13.118 --> 02:01:14.720]  One seed bank at a time.
[02:01:15.821 --> 02:01:19.785]  Seeds in the Survival Seed Bank are hand-picked for exceptional germination rates.
[02:01:20.345 --> 02:01:24.209]  Order a couple of seed banks today while you still can at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:01:24.549 --> 02:01:28.233]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give Solutions from Science a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:01:28.253 --> 02:01:28.293]  877-327-0365.
[02:01:38.666 --> 02:01:41.288]  Continuing here with one other great sponsor, Front Sight.
[02:01:41.728 --> 02:01:44.830]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza?
[02:01:45.170 --> 02:01:50.674]  The founder of the Front Sight Firearms Training Institute is offering a free handgun and five days of firearms training to my listeners.
[02:01:51.234 --> 02:01:58.559]  This offer is only available for a limited time because Dr. Piazza is literally paying his own money out of pocket to be able to offer you this deal and it won't last forever, so listen up.
[02:01:58.979 --> 02:02:06.224]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at the Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[02:02:06.804 --> 02:02:12.147]  Act fast and they will give you a free, that's free, Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:02:12.607 --> 02:02:17.970]  I believe now is the time for you and your family to be armed and trained to levels that exceed even law enforcement and military standards.
[02:02:18.530 --> 02:02:23.192]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:02:23.592 --> 02:02:27.014]  Thousands have already taken the advantage of this opportunity and you should too.
[02:02:27.054 --> 02:02:27.614]  Don't miss out.
[02:02:27.654 --> 02:02:28.975]  It's FrontSight.com.
[02:02:29.755 --> 02:02:35.198]  That's FrontSight.com or visit their links on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.
[02:02:37.328 --> 02:02:47.674]  Okay, listen, I'm going to take your calls, but earlier, I took a lot of calls today, earlier in the first two hours, but I kind of will go four or five minutes with each caller.
[02:02:47.694 --> 02:02:49.275]  I want to get everybody on, so let's move quick.
[02:02:49.655 --> 02:02:51.696]  Robert in Europe, thanks for holding, you're on the air.
[02:02:53.117 --> 02:02:54.318]  Just hung up as I went to him.
[02:02:54.778 --> 02:02:56.519]  Robert in California, you're on the air.
[02:02:57.500 --> 02:02:58.660]  Robert in San Diego, alright.
[02:02:59.101 --> 02:03:00.121]  Hey Alex, I love you man.
[02:03:00.301 --> 02:03:03.023]  And Lord Mocton, that guy is awesome, he totally rocks.
[02:03:03.621 --> 02:03:10.216]  I was listening to that poetic treatise given earlier that was power-packed and to the point and it made me write down some stuff about the climate gate.
[02:03:10.825 --> 02:03:14.888]  And first of all, the Climategate hackers, there should be amnesty for them.
[02:03:15.188 --> 02:03:16.289]  Let's start that right now.
[02:03:16.349 --> 02:03:21.692]  Well, more and more the media, it looks like we took the bait, called it hackers so it wouldn't be admissible in court.
[02:03:22.213 --> 02:03:28.137]  It's people inside the evidences that leaked it who were involved in research and didn't want to be prosecuted later.
[02:03:28.637 --> 02:03:34.361]  Because see, there was a FOIA request that almost got it released, but then their bosses colluded with government to block it.
[02:03:34.841 --> 02:03:37.083]  And so it looks like it's just whistleblowers.
[02:03:37.918 --> 02:03:41.700]  Alright, well that poetic treatise made me write down just a really one-paragraph poem.
[02:03:41.720 --> 02:03:43.941]  It's called Al Gore, Pimper Whore.
[02:03:44.502 --> 02:03:46.242]  Carbon taxes for all the poor.
[02:03:46.963 --> 02:03:51.145]  Hear ye, hear ye, to all you feudal peasant slaves of the once great USA.
[02:03:51.585 --> 02:03:59.449]  Feeding the beast of blood and gore with all your trillions forevermore will never quench their lust, you see, to profit from your stupidity.
[02:03:59.469 --> 02:04:02.891]  I mean, come on people, carbon dioxide is what trees breathe!
[02:04:03.432 --> 02:04:03.792]  That's it.
[02:04:06.069 --> 02:04:07.012]  Very well said.
[02:04:07.354 --> 02:04:08.478]  Very well said, my friend.
[02:04:08.558 --> 02:04:12.392]  Speaking of blood and gore, there is a British fellow...
[02:04:13.919 --> 02:04:17.162]  I mean, wasn't it not too long ago they said we're all going to die of an ice age?
[02:04:43.945 --> 02:04:45.425]  Then they came up with global warming.
[02:04:45.765 --> 02:04:46.986]  Now it's climate change.
[02:04:47.106 --> 02:04:51.927]  A word that seems to very well fit their fall, since there's a tsunami of eternal resistors.
[02:04:52.567 --> 02:04:56.348]  And I just thank God for you being a true guardian, and God bless, Alex.
[02:04:56.368 --> 02:04:56.788]  Love you, man.
[02:04:57.248 --> 02:04:58.169]  I love that term.
[02:04:58.329 --> 02:05:00.309]  Eternal resistance to tyranny.
[02:05:00.329 --> 02:05:04.330]  I think Thomas Jefferson said that.
[02:05:04.370 --> 02:05:05.230]  Thank you, Robert.
[02:05:05.290 --> 02:05:05.971]  We love you, too.
[02:05:06.171 --> 02:05:07.131]  Reid in Alabama.
[02:05:07.191 --> 02:05:07.971]  Reid, you're on the air.
[02:05:09.572 --> 02:05:09.912]  Hey, Alex.
[02:05:09.932 --> 02:05:10.412]  How you doing?
[02:05:10.752 --> 02:05:10.972]  Good.
[02:05:13.607 --> 02:05:14.408]  Got a question for you.
[02:05:14.428 --> 02:05:21.117]  Do you ever research on the people that you happen to hire to work for you or volunteer to do such?
[02:05:22.418 --> 02:05:25.562]  Well, I've never had really a big enough office to hire too many people.
[02:05:27.184 --> 02:05:30.729]  But we, you know, we do do some research on the people we hire.
[02:05:31.778 --> 02:05:37.579]  Not because we're doing anything wrong here, but because feds and their informants will come in and try to commit crimes in our organization.
[02:05:38.180 --> 02:05:40.180]  They've been caught doing that to countless other people.
[02:05:40.860 --> 02:05:42.241]  But yeah, no, we do research.
[02:05:42.281 --> 02:05:54.184]  I mean, mainly I hire people like Kurt Nemo, Paul Watson, Steve Watson, people like that who do the writing and key research because I've watched them for years with their own websites, their own writing.
[02:05:54.404 --> 02:05:55.424]  They have a clear history.
[02:05:56.627 --> 02:06:00.790]  And I know that they're patriots who understand the New World Order and how to fight it.
[02:06:01.450 --> 02:06:03.011]  But that's basically how we hire people.
[02:06:03.772 --> 02:06:05.293]  Well, that really wasn't what I was talking about.
[02:06:05.333 --> 02:06:07.374]  I was more specific about like your forums.
[02:06:07.775 --> 02:06:13.839]  Such people like Jack Travis and the fact that he scammed several people out of money.
[02:06:14.468 --> 02:06:23.132]  With his own gun company and you had him on your radio show promoting his $30,000 money bomb in which his house... Hold on just a minute.
[02:06:23.152 --> 02:06:23.532]  Hold on.
[02:06:23.572 --> 02:06:23.913]  Hold on.
[02:06:24.253 --> 02:06:26.874]  I mean, we didn't screen your call calling in here, did we, sir?
[02:06:27.694 --> 02:06:27.914]  No.
[02:06:28.515 --> 02:06:30.876]  Okay, but people also say all my calls are fake.
[02:06:32.817 --> 02:06:33.937]  What's this person's name again?
[02:06:34.698 --> 02:06:35.458]  Jack Travis.
[02:06:35.538 --> 02:06:37.079]  It goes by JT Coyote.
[02:06:38.820 --> 02:06:39.440]  Oh, I know him.
[02:06:39.500 --> 02:06:43.122]  I've had him on the show whenever the police... He had a...
[02:06:44.696 --> 02:06:47.997]  Realtor in his house, and they saw reloading equipment and called the police on him.
[02:06:48.397 --> 02:06:50.078]  And that was in the paper, so we had him on.
[02:06:50.098 --> 02:06:51.379]  But listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:06:53.279 --> 02:06:54.240]  Forum moderators.
[02:06:54.300 --> 02:06:57.481]  Paul Watson runs the Prison Planet Forum.
[02:06:58.902 --> 02:07:02.643]  And just like any other forum, we end up getting moderators.
[02:07:03.123 --> 02:07:09.446]  And separate from JT Coyote, we've had other people
[02:07:10.455 --> 02:07:14.096]  Like, I didn't even know what you're talking about, about him having a money bomb.
[02:07:14.136 --> 02:07:25.238]  I mean, I can't keep track of my own email and things I'm doing, and I'm so tempted to get rid of the Prison Planet Forum, because it has caused us a lot of problems.
[02:07:25.658 --> 02:07:35.680]  But it also, so much good information gets posted, there's so much happens, but I can't sit here with what people are saying with a forum, or what's going on, or what's happening with a forum.
[02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:45.563]  We've had other people that were forum moderators that have caused problems that we've gotten rid of, and then they attack us and tell lies about us, and it's just an endless source of problems.
[02:07:45.723 --> 02:07:54.127]  But you look at the internet, it's all built and based on user content, on people posting and talking.
[02:07:55.663 --> 02:07:59.544]  You know, I got a visit from the FBI and I got subpoenaed.
[02:07:59.884 --> 02:08:08.567]  And in the subpoena, there was a gag order from the federal court in California, not to talk about it, because they didn't want the person they were going after to be able to flee.
[02:08:10.047 --> 02:08:12.708]  And I said on air, we've been visited by the FBI.
[02:08:12.748 --> 02:08:13.888]  People said, oh, you're a liar.
[02:08:14.908 --> 02:08:16.249]  Tell us who the FBI was.
[02:08:16.289 --> 02:08:17.009]  Tell us why.
[02:08:17.389 --> 02:08:21.270]  And then later it came out in the Associated Press and Wired Magazine.
[02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:21.950]  What happened?
[02:08:22.050 --> 02:08:22.591]  What went on?
[02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:33.263]  I mean, I'm here doing a radio show, and what you do on the internet, decisions you make on the internet, that's your issue.
[02:08:34.384 --> 02:08:35.724]  Paul Watts, here's the problem.
[02:08:36.224 --> 02:08:48.110]  I don't have the funds and the money to run the forums, to run the comment pages right, because I would probably have to hire five people that I don't have money to hire just to sit in there
[02:08:49.417 --> 02:08:55.707]  Cutting out anything, policing people, making sure people don't run their own operations, their own side things.
[02:08:56.168 --> 02:09:00.334]  I mean, there's spam all over InfoWars and Prison Planet comments.
[02:09:01.354 --> 02:09:04.855]  And people will spam every article with their products or what they're doing.
[02:09:05.176 --> 02:09:07.016]  People will then go buy the product.
[02:09:07.056 --> 02:09:08.737]  They don't like the product and they blame me.
[02:09:09.497 --> 02:09:10.898]  I have no control over that.
[02:09:10.978 --> 02:09:18.761]  And then, if somebody spams everywhere, we have a computer program in there that if somebody spams the same term over and over again, it's a spam filter.
[02:09:18.781 --> 02:09:20.241]  Then they accuse me of censorship.
[02:09:20.942 --> 02:09:24.003]  Censorship would be if I came and shut down your website.
[02:09:24.723 --> 02:09:26.344]  Censorship would be if...
[02:09:28.618 --> 02:09:29.679]  I mean, it's so frustrating.
[02:09:30.119 --> 02:09:32.481]  Censorship would be if I stopped your free speech.
[02:09:32.541 --> 02:09:41.007]  It's not censorship if I erase somebody's comment on InfoWars or Prison Planet or on the forum calling for murdering people.
[02:09:42.468 --> 02:09:43.689]  That is not censorship.
[02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:56.699]  Or if somebody types the same term in hundreds of times per post and then the spam filter kicks in, thinking it's spam because it is, then they squeal and yell.
[02:09:58.286 --> 02:10:11.490]  I will say this, if some rich person wants to step forward and give me a yearly donation, if I paid people $20,000 a year, I could hire 5 people.
[02:10:13.030 --> 02:10:14.370]  Pretty close to minimum wage.
[02:10:15.231 --> 02:10:16.091]  I could hire 5 people.
[02:10:17.722 --> 02:10:24.265]  So that the weekends would be covered and 24 hours a day we'd have a nighttime person, then I could do that.
[02:10:24.926 --> 02:10:26.287]  Or I could just shut it all down.
[02:10:27.027 --> 02:10:31.189]  But I almost hate to give in to people that are going wild all over the sites and all over the place.
[02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:34.952]  I'm not saying the person you called in is a bad guy.
[02:10:35.312 --> 02:10:35.692]  I don't know.
[02:10:35.732 --> 02:10:36.633]  He seems like a nice guy.
[02:10:37.554 --> 02:10:40.296]  But also, a lot of people go and become forum people or whatever.
[02:10:40.316 --> 02:10:45.580]  That's why we don't have moderators on InfoWars and Prison Planet because they set up their own little petty kingdoms.
[02:10:46.121 --> 02:10:47.642]  And I don't know how all this works.
[02:10:50.526 --> 02:10:53.327]  Maybe we should have a listener vote and just go ahead and get rid of all of it.
[02:10:54.008 --> 02:11:02.251]  Because the biggest reason I don't start a radio network of my own with Ted Anderson and have all these hosts under me, is I don't want to be responsible for what they say and do.
[02:11:02.431 --> 02:11:04.232]  I want my message to be my message.
[02:11:05.312 --> 02:11:05.613]  You know?
[02:11:06.393 --> 02:11:08.034]  I want to be pure about what I'm doing.
[02:11:08.374 --> 02:11:13.176]  But when you work with other people, it can't stay pure.
[02:11:14.755 --> 02:11:24.759]  But then I also want 99% of the stuff on the forum and the comments is great, informative information.
[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:28.941]  So donate to us.
[02:11:29.802 --> 02:11:31.042]  Support us financially.
[02:11:32.143 --> 02:11:33.963]  So we can hire the people to make this better.
[02:11:34.163 --> 02:11:36.645]  But I mean, you know, we're victims of our own success.
[02:11:36.685 --> 02:11:38.645]  We're not really successful monetarily.
[02:11:40.146 --> 02:11:42.607]  We are to a certain extent to be able to grow to the point we have.
[02:11:43.287 --> 02:11:44.248]  But at the same time,
[02:11:47.421 --> 02:11:54.885]  Because we are so successful reaching people, we have millions of people a week coming to us, millions a day in many cases, and I can't even keep track of it.
[02:11:56.105 --> 02:11:58.627]  I mean, a lot of times I'm the guy carrying the trash out up here.
[02:11:59.227 --> 02:12:03.869]  You know, I'm the guy that's gotta, you know, sometimes tell people, because I don't really micromanage them, to get up off their butts.
[02:12:04.230 --> 02:12:05.490]  Most people work real hard up here.
[02:12:07.992 --> 02:12:10.033]  And see, that just burned all our time for calls.
[02:12:10.073 --> 02:12:14.035]  I don't have time to go to everybody else because I promised to play this clip and hit a few other news items.
[02:12:15.057 --> 02:12:20.618]  I always say I'm going to go to calls quickly, but the good, the bad, and the ugly, it all takes time to discuss in any... Look, I know this.
[02:12:20.698 --> 02:12:22.459]  I'm not the IRS coming and taking your house.
[02:12:22.979 --> 02:12:25.299]  I'm not the Copenhagen Treaty stuff.
[02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:27.100]  Ron Paul isn't doing that to you.
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:31.401]  And so, forum moderators don't work for me.
[02:12:31.821 --> 02:12:33.741]  It's people Watson's tried to choose.
[02:12:34.202 --> 02:12:35.702]  We do need to police things more.
[02:12:36.322 --> 02:12:44.164]  And we need to have a rule to all the forum people that if they advertise their own businesses or own operations, when they're... I guess we just can't allow any solicitation.
[02:12:44.704 --> 02:12:48.890]  In fact, I'm ordering the moderators, unless they don't want to be moderators anymore, no more solicitation.
[02:12:49.170 --> 02:12:53.896]  You can have solicitation to political events and things, but no more sales of other stuff.
[02:12:54.639 --> 02:12:55.579]  Or we're just going to ban you?
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:12:57.780]  Because I can't deal with this.
[02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:06.484]  I can't deal with a couple hundred thousand people a week in the Prison Planet Forum all fighting with each other and crapping on each other.
[02:13:07.724 --> 02:13:09.125]  That's what America is, though.
[02:13:09.185 --> 02:13:10.405]  I mean, that's what we've become.
[02:13:10.925 --> 02:13:14.687]  And I can't let all that overshadow my mission and what I'm doing.
[02:13:15.607 --> 02:13:23.050]  And so I'm busy with a lot of other projects, but I've been procrastinating on a decision on the forums, on the comments.
[02:13:25.595 --> 02:13:27.938]  Maybe we need to shut it down for a few weeks and purge.
[02:13:27.978 --> 02:13:29.399]  In fact, I'm making the decision right now.
[02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:31.681]  I don't want the forum erased.
[02:13:32.102 --> 02:13:33.944]  I want the forum locked down now.
[02:13:33.964 --> 02:13:37.287]  It's like when you have a disease, you need a fever to burn it out.
[02:13:37.648 --> 02:13:45.957]  I want the forum locked and I want the comments closed on InfoWars until we at least get one or two people in here to try to control this.
[02:13:47.301 --> 02:13:57.007]  And that means we gotta hire him and I'm just gonna beg for more money here and try to sling more videos and promote things because, you know, we're trying to fight the New World Order here and I'm sick of distractions.
[02:13:58.187 --> 02:14:01.970]  So, forum shut down for now and are the comments.
[02:14:02.050 --> 02:14:03.230]  Shut them all down right now.
[02:14:03.851 --> 02:14:04.911]  You want it, you got it.
[02:14:05.372 --> 02:14:07.213]  Because I've already been thinking about this for a long time.
[02:14:07.373 --> 02:14:08.914]  This will force me to make a decision on it.
[02:14:09.844 --> 02:14:10.925]  We'll put it in purgatory.
[02:14:10.965 --> 02:14:13.047]  Can't put it in heaven or hell, I'll put it in purgatory.
[02:14:13.587 --> 02:14:16.669]  Let's go ahead now and go to the Charlie Sheen, part of the Charlie Sheen interview.
[02:14:17.010 --> 02:14:23.494]  Something constructive, something informative, something good, something pure, and then we'll go out to break and come back and finish up.
[02:14:23.534 --> 02:14:23.855]  Here it is.
[02:14:24.912 --> 02:14:35.661]  Well, he had an idea, Charlie Sheen, director, producer, TV star, film star, and it has grown and grown.
[02:14:35.961 --> 02:14:39.164]  20minuteswiththepresident.com or infowars.com.
[02:14:39.184 --> 02:14:42.146]  Christo Garcia, the winner, first place, $14,000 paid by Charlie.
[02:14:43.827 --> 02:14:45.769]  I said, we'll have second and third place.
[02:14:45.889 --> 02:14:46.489]  I'll pay that.
[02:14:46.509 --> 02:14:48.451]  I'm going to be covering that the next few days.
[02:14:48.491 --> 02:14:53.354]  It was a lot of other great entries, but Christo's really was a cut above the rest.
[02:14:53.374 --> 02:14:54.595]  We appreciate everybody's effort.
[02:14:55.035 --> 02:14:59.298]  Everyone wins by participating in telling the truth.
[02:15:00.039 --> 02:15:01.280]  Going back to Charlie Sheen.
[02:15:02.241 --> 02:15:05.203]  Charlie, when we talk privately, you discuss integrity.
[02:15:05.603 --> 02:15:08.085]  At the end of the day is all that matters.
[02:15:08.365 --> 02:15:10.707]  And I know there's 20 minutes with the president.
[02:15:11.287 --> 02:15:13.769]  Is really feeling good right now, doing the right thing?
[02:15:14.229 --> 02:15:15.290]  Oh, absolutely, Alex.
[02:15:15.410 --> 02:15:15.971]  Absolutely.
[02:15:16.111 --> 02:15:33.763]  And the response to it, regardless of how the mainstream media dealt with it, if you read the blogs and the postings and everything else, you can see that it really struck something with the people.
[02:15:33.824 --> 02:15:35.024]  It really struck something.
[02:15:36.829 --> 02:15:39.290]  You know, reignited the truth movement on some level.
[02:15:39.391 --> 02:15:47.695]  It just, you know, even, you know, people on the street would come up to me randomly and say, you know, I didn't believe any of that crap until I read your piece.
[02:15:47.735 --> 02:15:48.816]  And I went, oh, wait a minute.
[02:15:49.436 --> 02:15:52.718]  A lot of that stuff is hard to debate or disassemble.
[02:15:52.798 --> 02:15:56.260]  And it's, wow, man, you've really opened my eyes.
[02:15:56.300 --> 02:15:57.941]  And I'm going to start spreading the word.
[02:15:59.182 --> 02:16:08.927]  You know, it's like I told you at the beginning of this thing, if we can, you know, change one person's view, and then they tell one person and so on, that's how any movement begins.
[02:16:09.047 --> 02:16:18.831]  And so, you know, I don't look at this as, you know, 20 minutes with the President as any kind of a failure, because we didn't wind up on Larry King Live or, you know, GMA or whatever.
[02:16:19.911 --> 02:16:27.335]  You know, I look at it as a real victory and as a real hope that people are, you know,
[02:16:28.180 --> 02:16:29.861]  You know, ready to embrace the truth.
[02:16:30.341 --> 02:16:40.245]  Well, it was a total success, but every time we got the emails, or you got them, and you were sending them to me, it was, we want to interview you for the news, and you knew they could cut all that up.
[02:16:40.966 --> 02:16:49.770]  When you wanted a 50-50 live debate, they would not give it to you, because they wanted to be able to manipulate and play with what you were saying.
[02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.450]  Of course.
[02:16:50.930 --> 02:16:51.370]  Of course.
[02:16:51.410 --> 02:16:53.231]  It's what they do.
[02:16:53.351 --> 02:16:54.132]  It's how they do it.
[02:16:54.152 --> 02:16:55.692]  It's what they do all day, every day.
[02:16:55.752 --> 02:16:56.433]  And then, you know, it's...
[02:16:58.901 --> 02:17:11.190]  Uh, you know, as long as they've gotten them as their mouthpiece, then, you know, I don't want to say we're stuck in an uphill struggle, but we've got our work cut out for us, people.
[02:17:12.391 --> 02:17:13.932]  You know, there's no question about that.
[02:17:14.861 --> 02:17:21.745]  At the same time, the mainstream controlled corporate press is not going to tell us how much success we've had.
[02:17:21.785 --> 02:17:23.846]  Charlie, you talk about people on the street coming up to you.
[02:17:24.486 --> 02:17:29.509]  I've been with you when people come up and they bring up 9-11 Truth and thank you for what you've done.
[02:17:29.869 --> 02:17:34.451]  But I'm just little old Alex Jones with a radio show and documentary films I make.
[02:17:34.771 --> 02:17:36.692]  My cousin was visiting from Chicago.
[02:17:36.712 --> 02:17:41.795]  It was my dad's birthday, so we were getting food for the party and buying a late gift.
[02:17:42.275 --> 02:17:43.676]  And literally in Austin,
[02:17:44.377 --> 02:17:53.033]  Every person we walked into, every person in the parking lot, all the people at the gas station, the guy behind the counter, everyone!
[02:17:53.053 --> 02:17:56.118]  I mean, it was like a hallucination!
[02:17:59.429 --> 02:18:03.473]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.
[02:18:03.934 --> 02:18:06.897]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved.
[02:18:07.298 --> 02:18:11.802]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla, and I've been solving tax debt problems for 30 years, and I can help you too.
[02:18:12.163 --> 02:18:16.808]  We can stabilize IRS collection action and get your tax debt reduced, sometimes completely eliminated.
[02:18:17.316 --> 02:18:28.842]  And if you received a 1099 from a bank because of mortgage or other debt forgiveness, the vast majority of the time, I can show you how to completely erase it so you pay no taxes on what the IRS will consider to be taxable income.
[02:18:29.162 --> 02:18:31.984]  Call us for a free consultation to discuss the many possibilities.
[02:18:32.464 --> 02:18:35.405]  Call 1-800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:18:35.706 --> 02:18:38.707]  That's 1-800-34-N-O-T-A-X.
[02:18:39.027 --> 02:18:41.828]  Or go to my website at TaxHelpOnline.com.
[02:18:42.148 --> 02:18:46.991]  Dan Pilla has been protecting taxpayers from the IRS for three decades, and he can help you.
[02:18:47.431 --> 02:18:48.371]  Call us today, 1-800-346-6829.
[02:18:48.431 --> 02:18:48.811]  That's 1-800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:18:58.186 --> 02:19:01.874]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:19:02.215 --> 02:19:05.221]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:19:05.462 --> 02:19:06.884]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:19:07.566 --> 02:19:10.227]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:19:10.247 --> 02:19:16.469]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:19:16.649 --> 02:19:22.151]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:19:22.171 --> 02:19:31.814]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:19:31.934 --> 02:19:34.036]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:19:34.276 --> 02:19:35.618]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:19:35.878 --> 02:19:38.160]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:40.182]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:19:40.463 --> 02:19:45.267]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:20:59.286 --> 02:21:05.328]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:21:05.928 --> 02:21:08.869]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:24.088 --> 02:21:25.769]  Okay, go ahead and roll that audio.
[02:21:25.829 --> 02:21:26.850]  Charlie Sheen, here we go.
[02:21:27.770 --> 02:21:33.334]  Data, to the processing of the data, to making the data available to other people, to writing up the data.
[02:21:33.434 --> 02:21:34.895]  That's the wrong interview, guys.
[02:21:35.195 --> 02:21:35.756]  Just forget it.
[02:21:37.177 --> 02:21:37.877]  Just forget it.
[02:21:37.917 --> 02:21:39.098]  It's alright, because we're out of time.
[02:21:39.118 --> 02:21:41.239]  You know, the show just runs out of time.
[02:21:41.279 --> 02:21:47.523]  The Charlie Sheen interview was amazing, and it's posted in full at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:47.743 --> 02:21:49.044]  It's alright, it's too late now.
[02:21:52.708 --> 02:21:55.233]  As for the forum, I don't want everybody to freak out about this.
[02:21:55.814 --> 02:21:57.537]  I've been procrastinating too long.
[02:21:57.957 --> 02:22:05.130]  We can't be doing the important work we're doing and not have a handle from my office on what's going on with the Prison Planet Forum.
[02:22:06.027 --> 02:22:12.128]  I mean, you let people do whatever they want is a constant irritant, a constant distraction from what I'm doing.
[02:22:12.688 --> 02:22:14.329]  So much good stuff is there as well.
[02:22:14.949 --> 02:22:33.293]  I just have to shut it down for a while to make myself stop procrastinating, to get some of my own people moderating it, and to codify some really serious rules for people, or it becomes a free-for-all and it allows infiltrators and problem people to come in and just do whatever they want.
[02:22:34.153 --> 02:22:41.297]  As for InfoWars and Prison Planet, the comment sections, I mean, people will say something racist in the first comment.
[02:22:41.357 --> 02:22:45.880]  We can check their IP and it'll be a Fed trying to get us all fighting with each other.
[02:22:46.300 --> 02:22:50.602]  Or they'll say, first, on purpose, even though they're not the first commenter to get everybody to say, oh, you're an idiot.
[02:22:51.023 --> 02:22:52.603]  Because they don't want you organizing.
[02:22:52.643 --> 02:22:53.644]  They don't want you talking.
[02:22:53.924 --> 02:22:54.905]  They don't want you meeting.
[02:22:55.325 --> 02:23:00.548]  You know, I've meant to build something where it's like Meetup,
[02:23:06.060 --> 02:23:11.764]  Where everybody has their own little page, and then people meet like-minded people locally.
[02:23:11.804 --> 02:23:14.286]  We're building that for PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:23:14.326 --> 02:23:20.150]  It's just a money issue of having the IT people getting it done, getting these projects done, and we keep expanding what we're doing.
[02:23:20.491 --> 02:23:26.655]  But clearly this open format of just, hey, Wild West free-for-all is a problem.
[02:23:28.296 --> 02:23:33.740]  And so I'm going to just lock those up the next few days to make myself focus on
[02:23:36.695 --> 02:23:45.301]  On cleaning it up, doing an investigation, finding out what's going on, and giving moderators the rules, and if they violate them, we're going to ban them.
[02:23:46.562 --> 02:23:51.185]  Because, I mean, everybody knows about the Internet, who's been on the Internet.
[02:23:51.225 --> 02:23:52.226]  It's just a mess.
[02:23:52.726 --> 02:23:54.768]  But there's also so much good stuff happening.
[02:23:54.788 --> 02:23:58.410]  Look at Climategate, how the mainstream media in the past could have ignored this.
[02:23:58.791 --> 02:24:01.693]  They can't now because the alternative media drives it out in the open.
[02:24:02.699 --> 02:24:09.925]  And instead of callers when I go to them bringing up important issues and how we can organize and what we can do, it's just all this ninnying and fighting.
[02:24:10.466 --> 02:24:12.968]  But again, that's the hair and the guts and the eyeballs.
[02:24:13.028 --> 02:24:16.110]  That's the bad stuff that's going to be mixed in with the good stuff.
[02:24:16.551 --> 02:24:21.255]  And overall we couldn't be more happy with what's happening in our fight against the New World Order.
[02:24:21.295 --> 02:24:22.476]  We couldn't be more excited.
[02:24:23.820 --> 02:24:32.706]  It's hard for people to screw something up like Fall of the Republic or Obama Deception that we sell the DVDs of that support our operation but we also give out for free on YouTube and Google.
[02:24:33.486 --> 02:24:37.148]  It's hard for people to screw that up.
[02:24:37.328 --> 02:24:41.511]  It's over 100 million people conservatively that have seen our films online that we know of.
[02:24:42.352 --> 02:24:43.532]  That is effective.
[02:24:43.592 --> 02:24:44.333]  That is great.
[02:24:44.753 --> 02:24:49.376]  And I can't let all this other stuff become a distraction and jeopardize what I'm doing.
[02:24:51.144 --> 02:25:02.510]  Because we're also so successful that we get attacked from all angles, not just through COINTELPRO, but through just jealous, envious people that are jealous of our energy, our passion, our courage.
[02:25:02.930 --> 02:25:06.292]  So I want to salute We Are Change Chicago and others for confronting Al Gore.
[02:25:06.372 --> 02:25:07.232]  Couldn't have done it better.
[02:25:07.592 --> 02:25:08.333]  You are beautiful.
[02:25:08.373 --> 02:25:10.034]  We got those folks coming up later in the week.
[02:25:10.374 --> 02:25:12.415]  Some big surprise guests as well.
[02:25:12.835 --> 02:25:15.717]  We took a lot of great phone calls, covered a lot of key news today.
[02:25:16.157 --> 02:25:19.158]  Retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com.
[02:25:20.439 --> 02:25:24.380]  And we'll be posting the video from this show as well, along with the audio, at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:25:24.420 --> 02:25:26.580]  You can get five months free right now.
[02:25:26.600 --> 02:25:28.541]  I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[02:25:28.901 --> 02:25:30.481]  They make what we do here possible.
[02:25:30.841 --> 02:25:32.361]  So I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[02:25:32.401 --> 02:25:33.142]  God bless you all.
[02:25:33.182 --> 02:25:33.862]  Great job, crew.
[02:25:36.782 --> 02:25:41.883]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:25:42.523 --> 02:25:45.724]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:25:47.079 --> 02:25:49.681]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:25:50.081 --> 02:25:55.044]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:25:55.425 --> 02:25:57.166]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:25:57.466 --> 02:26:02.289]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:26:02.469 --> 02:26:03.430]  How much do you want?
[02:26:03.650 --> 02:26:04.390]  When do you want it?
[02:26:04.771 --> 02:26:06.372]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:26:06.652 --> 02:26:07.493]  When will you need it?
[02:26:07.733 --> 02:26:09.794]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:26:09.934 --> 02:26:11.055]  Will there be any food?
[02:26:11.275 --> 02:26:12.576]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:26:12.796 --> 02:26:17.861]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:26:18.061 --> 02:26:21.264]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:26:21.644 --> 02:26:25.147]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:26:25.467 --> 02:26:26.448]  How much will you need?
[02:26:26.689 --> 02:26:27.309]  We don't know.
[02:26:27.589 --> 02:26:28.510]  How much do you want?
[02:26:28.690 --> 02:26:29.431]  All you can get.
[02:26:29.451 --> 02:26:30.432]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:26:30.712 --> 02:26:33.474]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:26:33.754 --> 02:26:35.515]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:26:35.535 --> 02:26:36.596]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:26:36.616 --> 02:26:40.719]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
