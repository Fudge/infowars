[00:00:05.225 --> 00:00:10.729]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome, we are live on this Thursday edition
[00:00:32.068 --> 00:00:33.689]  And I am from the road.
[00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:36.532]  I'm going to have live updates throughout the broadcast today.
[00:00:37.192 --> 00:00:45.799]  We have Dead Mustang and a bunch of other powerful interviews we've done in the last few weeks coming up today, but I'll also be popping in some live today.
[00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:51.264]  I have been gone out of town so much, working so much, finishing Fall of the Republic.
[00:00:51.324 --> 00:01:00.131]  I was intending to spend a little bit of time with my family, but I've been having to stay up on the news and the plunging of the dollar and gold at an all-time record high.
[00:01:01.553 --> 00:01:08.675]  So I wanted people right here at the start of the show to have an opportunity, because these opportunities don't grow on trees.
[00:01:08.695 --> 00:01:10.296]  I mean, these come along every once in a while.
[00:01:11.436 --> 00:01:27.622]  To be locked in, to be guaranteed to have immediate profit, where Ted bought gold at the $9.94 level, and now it's at $1,057 today and climbing, that's twenty-something, almost thirty-something dollars over the previous record of $1,030.
[00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:31.459]  We're good to go.
[00:02:05.827 --> 00:02:07.509]  I'll be happy to tell you what's going on.
[00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:09.231]  The market is just crazily hot.
[00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:11.514]  I mean, I haven't had time to adjust prices yet.
[00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:15.643]  Right now, gold right now is sitting at $1,057.60, has seen a high today of $1,059.60.
[00:02:15.703 --> 00:02:16.904]  Silver is almost $18 an ounce now, $17.88.
[00:02:16.944 --> 00:02:20.666]  The dollar right now is dropping, I mean dropping hard, it's not dropping just a small amount.
[00:02:32.142 --> 00:02:43.051]  There was a lot of news that came out to try to counter what happened in the Middle East when they said that they were getting together with Russia and China to change the way that they price oil.
[00:02:43.432 --> 00:02:45.233]  The dollar is under attack right now.
[00:02:45.593 --> 00:02:49.296]  It's being attacked by foreigners.
[00:02:49.677 --> 00:02:57.623]  Basically, they're trying to win back control and have the United States lose its power grab here with the
[00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:02.626]  With the currency being the world currency.
[00:03:03.226 --> 00:03:05.127]  Regardless of what happens here.
[00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:07.107]  And we hope the dollar stays strong.
[00:03:07.147 --> 00:03:13.929]  Unfortunately, they've issued hundreds and hundreds of trillions of dollars of fiat currency over the last 20 years.
[00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.630]  They're accelerating that.
[00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.170]  It's well over $28 trillion.
[00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.131]  Last number we got was $24.7 or $23.7.
[00:03:18.171 --> 00:03:20.151]  The point is, is that all of this is happening
[00:03:25.883 --> 00:03:27.804]  The globalists are devaluing the dollar.
[00:03:27.824 --> 00:03:31.065]  The media is trying to blame it on the Chinese and the Russians, and they're certainly not angels.
[00:03:31.606 --> 00:03:39.749]  The point is, they see the globalists killing the dollar themselves, so they're saying, okay, with this new world order being born, how do we position ourselves?
[00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:46.692]  The citizens of America and Canada and the listeners of this show and listeners worldwide should be asking, how do they position themselves?
[00:03:47.132 --> 00:03:53.375]  And the safe haven is gold and silver, and everywhere else they've got huge premiums on it because of the gold rush.
[00:03:53.973 --> 00:03:57.015]  I'm offering the same prices as I did yesterday, yet gold went up another $10.
[00:03:57.095 --> 00:04:00.917]  So yes, indeed, if you're interested in buying gold and silver,
[00:04:22.586 --> 00:04:27.928]  At this particular time, at this moment, you can take advantage of a great offer from Midas Resources.
[00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:31.090]  But, I mean, just take a look at what's going on in the economy.
[00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.570]  You should be buying gold.
[00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:35.892]  We do have a great buy here, but at least get into the marketplace.
[00:04:36.252 --> 00:04:38.413]  Whether if you're going to buy it from us or not, I don't care.
[00:04:38.433 --> 00:04:38.913]  800-800-686-2237.
[00:04:38.933 --> 00:04:40.034]  Give them a call.
[00:04:40.054 --> 00:04:42.815]  Don't be stupid, folks.
[00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:48.117]  We're going to have live updates throughout the transmission on the fate of the dollar.
[00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:49.478]  Stay with us.
[00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:49.538]  800-686-2237.
[00:04:52.897 --> 00:04:54.749]  I'm gonna leave you alone.
[00:05:00.578 --> 00:05:08.065]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:05:08.325 --> 00:05:14.110]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.112]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:05:17.373 --> 00:05:23.278]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:05:23.638 --> 00:05:25.059]  This book will work for anyone.
[00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:27.501]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:33.105]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:05:33.345 --> 00:05:35.166]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:05:35.427 --> 00:05:36.808]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:05:37.168 --> 00:05:39.430]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.073]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:05:44.433 --> 00:05:47.816]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[00:05:48.136 --> 00:05:50.277]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:05:51.238 --> 00:05:52.819]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:53.799]  One last time.
[00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:55.980]  It's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:06:00.821 --> 00:06:02.862]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:06:03.002 --> 00:06:05.403]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:06:05.423 --> 00:06:08.064]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:06:08.084 --> 00:06:09.224]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:10.885]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:06:10.965 --> 00:06:13.425]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:06:13.645 --> 00:06:17.467]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:06:27.135 --> 00:06:32.065]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:06:33.287 --> 00:06:34.389]  An inside job!
[00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:39.612]  How dare you?
[00:06:39.872 --> 00:06:43.295]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:06:43.315 --> 00:06:45.997]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:06:46.017 --> 00:06:52.382]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.390]  Big Brother
[00:08:07.108 --> 00:08:08.148]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:09.969]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:11.430]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.110]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:17.412]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.952 --> 00:08:22.013]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.325 --> 00:08:31.849]  World Government is openly being announced and formed in front of our very eyes.
[00:08:31.869 --> 00:08:35.673]  Barack Obama has engaged in high treason and become the first U.S.
[00:08:35.693 --> 00:08:37.054]  President to chair the U.N.
[00:08:37.074 --> 00:08:37.955]  Security Council.
[00:08:38.615 --> 00:08:38.956]  The U.N.
[00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:42.859]  Security Council is the most powerful body, the only body with real power in the U.N.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:51.167]  The Secretary General chairs the General Assembly of all the different third world countries that have no power.
[00:08:51.387 --> 00:08:51.827]  Only the G20
[00:08:54.835 --> 00:09:08.642]  Finance ministers have the real power in the governmental systems of the nation-states, but the Security Council and its rotating 15-member board is the true power in the United Nations.
[00:09:10.803 --> 00:09:15.586]  And President Obama has violated Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[00:09:15.626 --> 00:09:19.228]  Constitution, taking his seat on the rotating board.
[00:09:20.209 --> 00:09:26.893]  Every 15 months, he is now saying he will chair it for the month-long duration of the month-long term.
[00:09:27.474 --> 00:09:36.980]  And he has to swear an oath to the UN Charter to do that, that is in complete contravention to our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and his oath of office.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.120]  We're going to be discussing that.
[00:09:39.561 --> 00:09:46.626]  I have a huge stack of news here today where they are openly
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.401]  Announcing world government.
[00:09:51.342 --> 00:09:52.902]  The New World Order.
[00:09:53.883 --> 00:09:55.764]  Just absolutely amazing.
[00:09:56.484 --> 00:09:59.045]  We have Israel saying they're getting ready to hit Iran.
[00:09:59.105 --> 00:10:03.707]  We see media hype and propaganda about how they have hidden nukes and hidden facilities.
[00:10:03.727 --> 00:10:07.749]  We're seeing a complete replay of 2002 into 2003 with a strike six and a half years ago on Iraq.
[00:10:12.648 --> 00:10:15.389]  We have military police kidnapping G20 protesters.
[00:10:15.929 --> 00:10:18.991]  Not just one, but one on video, but other confirmed reports.
[00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:24.813]  Anyone that even spoke out against it or videotaped it was then arrested by riot police and drug away.
[00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:30.676]  This is right out of Maoist China or Soviet Russia.
[00:10:32.717 --> 00:10:39.980]  And then we have the Newspaper Revitalization Act with Barack Obama saying he wants it to pass to federalize the major newspapers.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.261]  Openly a violation of the First Amendment.
[00:10:43.035 --> 00:10:47.380]  They're taking over the churches of the faith-based initiatives and the clergy response teams are taking over the newspapers.
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.901]  They're taking over the auto industry.
[00:10:48.921 --> 00:10:50.623]  They're taking over the banking industry.
[00:10:51.284 --> 00:10:55.188]  They want to take over health care, 20% of what's left of the economy.
[00:10:56.109 --> 00:10:59.493]  You think the insurance companies and hospitals do a sorry job sometimes.
[00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:02.016]  They're angels compared to the government.
[00:11:02.877 --> 00:11:09.479]  That's why the insurance companies are actually lobbying in many cases for this government takeover because then they're going to have liability protection.
[00:11:10.019 --> 00:11:13.620]  So that is all coming up today.
[00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:28.565]  As well, I also want to get into the fact that
[00:11:29.594 --> 00:11:37.299]  These bomb plots in Dallas and in Illinois are classically staged to hype all this Iran fear.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:45.884]  We are also going to get into this piece of propaganda.
[00:11:46.284 --> 00:11:49.386]  Spanking lowers a child's IQ, researchers say.
[00:11:50.747 --> 00:11:54.369]  And we have caught these different government researchers and university researchers.
[00:11:54.789 --> 00:11:58.131]  Well, remember the five years ago, a big Illinois, Chicago
[00:12:02.208 --> 00:12:21.037]  study came out saying that the founding fathers didn't like guns and only 10% of the colonists own guns and then other researchers like John Lott, the professor, went and researched it and found it was all a lie and the professor was disbarred.
[00:12:22.458 --> 00:12:24.299]  There needs to be an investigation of this
[00:12:25.447 --> 00:12:37.719]  Study because I'll guarantee you that the higher IQ families lied when they were asked in the survey in the study if they spanked their children knowing that it's not illegal to spank your children.
[00:12:37.759 --> 00:12:44.285]  It's just illegal to hurt them physically and that they would have their children taken.
[00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:47.151]  And I've seen this in polling science studies.
[00:12:48.032 --> 00:13:00.084]  When the media calls up a household and asks a controversial question, they found that depending on the question, around half of people will lie and go with what they believe the politically correct answer is.
[00:13:01.469 --> 00:13:05.092]  And the margin of error in the study is more than 5%.
[00:13:06.553 --> 00:13:09.516]  And so the whole thing is a fraud, but it's in the Los Angeles Times.
[00:13:09.596 --> 00:13:11.898]  Spanking lowers a child's IQ.
[00:13:11.998 --> 00:13:23.527]  Researchers say being spanked as a child is linked to having a lower IQ, according to a study presented today at the International Conference on Violence, Abuse, and Trauma in San Diego.
[00:13:23.567 --> 00:13:25.969]  That's a UN NGO-sponsored event.
[00:13:26.289 --> 00:13:27.711]  And again, the UN has openly stated
[00:13:28.726 --> 00:13:30.528]  Hundreds of times they want to end the family.
[00:13:30.808 --> 00:13:32.970]  They want no authority of the parents over the children.
[00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:39.436]  And even if you don't spank your children, they routinely take them for bruises on their knees, playing in the playground.
[00:13:39.936 --> 00:13:45.341]  I know parents here in Austin whose children at school fall off a jungle gym and break their finger or arm.
[00:13:45.642 --> 00:13:47.163]  CPS goes ahead and takes them.
[00:13:48.424 --> 00:13:51.387]  It just goes, children fall off the front porch, knock a tooth out.
[00:13:52.071 --> 00:13:53.052]  Something that happened to me.
[00:13:53.652 --> 00:13:54.793]  They try to take your children.
[00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:58.935]  Your child is playing in a tree, falls out, dislocates their shoulder.
[00:13:59.335 --> 00:13:59.976]  They take them.
[00:14:00.736 --> 00:14:02.057]  They are hunting your children.
[00:14:02.077 --> 00:14:04.398]  They're doing everything they can to set the precedent to take them.
[00:14:04.858 --> 00:14:13.063]  As John P. Holder in White House Science Czar's own government policy textbook states, states, openly,
[00:14:14.767 --> 00:14:18.874]  That they want to take basically all children globally and raise them in government dormitories.
[00:14:19.034 --> 00:14:22.780]  China is the model, the first country in the last 30 years to attempt this.
[00:14:24.663 --> 00:14:29.811]  Of course, they started with 2,000 families, now it's 20 plus thousand in England at birth.
[00:14:30.783 --> 00:14:52.801]  Or if you're on welfare, or in the government system, involved in their Secure Start, they don't call it Head Start over there, that 20,000 homes and growing, they want to double it again by next year, it'll be 40,000, have cameras in every room in the house, in the kitchen, in the bedrooms, in the bathrooms, government bureaucrats watch you 24-7 making you, quote, eat proper meals, go to sleep,
[00:14:53.775 --> 00:14:56.857]  on time and that you don't raise your voice to your children.
[00:14:57.097 --> 00:14:59.599]  Now, of course, the government can lock them up in little prison cells.
[00:14:59.939 --> 00:15:08.104]  The government can abuse them, can rape them five times more likely in US averages, even higher in England for the government to abuse children than any other group.
[00:15:08.424 --> 00:15:11.827]  But they're all above the law and held to a different lower standard.
[00:15:12.187 --> 00:15:16.930]  Parents are held to a bizarre standard of no yelling, no spanking, no nothing.
[00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.791]  And so the cameras will be going in your homes.
[00:15:20.251 --> 00:15:24.233]  Houston Police Chief two years ago called for cameras in everyone's homes in Houston.
[00:15:25.013 --> 00:15:28.455]  They are now taking warrantless checkpoints, taking blood at checkpoints.
[00:15:29.055 --> 00:15:40.399]  It just goes on and on and on and on everywhere with the different things that they are doing.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.660]  I sound a bit distracted here.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.782]  I had a giant stack on my desk
[00:15:48.917 --> 00:15:57.699]  With about 15 articles or so that I printed up where the mainstream media is calling for world government.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:09.982]  I also had a print up here of all of my YouTube clips that I was going to be playing.
[00:16:13.542 --> 00:16:14.362]  No, that's not it.
[00:16:15.643 --> 00:16:16.703]  That's the YouTube stack.
[00:16:18.487 --> 00:16:19.028]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[00:16:19.048 --> 00:16:21.971]  We can go to Google and type in New World Order and they'll all print up.
[00:16:22.071 --> 00:16:22.911]  I have two of them here.
[00:16:23.552 --> 00:16:28.657]  USA Today, Obama set stage for New World Order, Obama now President of the World.
[00:16:29.558 --> 00:16:30.559]  I've got all of that.
[00:16:32.381 --> 00:16:35.804]  The producers have begged me to clean the desk off every day, but I end up doing it about every week.
[00:16:36.285 --> 00:16:38.347]  There's literally probably a thousand or more articles.
[00:16:39.312 --> 00:16:41.033]  Sitting here on my stack.
[00:16:41.073 --> 00:16:42.554]  Sarkozy's called for a new world order.
[00:16:43.154 --> 00:16:54.241]  Basically every world leader we know of, Gordon Brown, Sarkozy, the Brazilian president, they've all called for a new world order and they've described what that new world order is.
[00:16:55.942 --> 00:17:02.206]  And they say it's a banking dictatorship over the planet.
[00:17:02.226 --> 00:17:06.589]  The only person, the only world leader to slam it
[00:17:07.805 --> 00:17:19.332]  Was the president of the Czech Republic, Václav Klaus, and he slammed global government and said we don't want global governance, that it will ruin our society.
[00:17:19.352 --> 00:17:23.575]  And I've got that in my stack from Wednesday.
[00:17:23.635 --> 00:17:31.500]  This is very bizarre, but I will no doubt find it during the break.
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.801]  I had it when I started the show.
[00:17:34.062 --> 00:17:35.863]  But we're going to go over all of this today.
[00:17:36.123 --> 00:17:36.964]  One of the other
[00:17:38.067 --> 00:17:51.513]  Huge, huge, huge, huge issues that we're going to be covering today is military police kidnap G20 protester, shove him into unmarked car.
[00:17:53.134 --> 00:17:54.295]  And this is on video.
[00:17:54.335 --> 00:18:03.319]  Now we've got scores, I mean scores of videos of police coming up to women doing nothing and billy clubbing them in the head or tackling them.
[00:18:03.919 --> 00:18:05.320]  For some reason they love to attack women.
[00:18:06.058 --> 00:18:16.048]  We've got video of the sound cannons firing at people that is right out of a sci-fi nightmare, sci-fi dystopic movie, black armored vehicles, police and military.
[00:18:17.216 --> 00:18:21.639]  Police in black uniforms broadcasting, this is an unlawful assembly, you must disperse.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.243]  And then firing rubber bullets and bean bags at people and tear gas and sound cannons.
[00:18:26.903 --> 00:18:36.531]  And then military just pulling up in unmarked cars, jumping out in military uniforms and grabbing peaceful protesters and slamming them into cars and dragging them away.
[00:18:36.931 --> 00:18:40.254]  But I see the officers, the military men, smiling.
[00:18:41.275 --> 00:18:46.879]  And we saw this in Ottawa in 2008 at the SPP, Security Prosperity Partnership Summit.
[00:18:47.834 --> 00:19:07.126]  And it did, and I said that's fake, that is a provocateur staging stuff for the media, and then the police stage arrest of them, and we'll probably end up getting contacted by the person, or some people listening to the show, if they're not a Fed, but preliminarily, I will give you the preliminary judgment, this is staged.
[00:19:07.506 --> 00:19:15.531]  Now why would they be staging the arrest, again, unmarked, champagne, Crown Vic pulls up,
[00:19:16.348 --> 00:19:26.937]  Three military MPs pile out, they grab the guy, and it looks like the urban warfare drills I've been to, where they hire actors to scream and yell and say, oh no, not the camp.
[00:19:27.458 --> 00:19:29.700]  Why would they be staging snatch and grabs?
[00:19:32.522 --> 00:19:33.443]  Now, it may be real.
[00:19:33.623 --> 00:19:34.404]  Either way, it's bad.
[00:19:34.424 --> 00:19:38.347]  They're either training everybody to accept snatch and grabs of the military, or it really happened.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.042]  And the reports are pouring in that, no, the military is arresting people for no reason.
[00:19:42.562 --> 00:19:44.523]  But this looks staged.
[00:19:44.563 --> 00:19:54.489]  Now, I can't play the audio, so we'll have to go to it once we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv, and I'll talk over it with play-by-play, because there's so much profanity as protesters are screaming and dropping F-bombs.
[00:19:54.969 --> 00:19:58.552]  But you can watch them uncensored at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:20:01.021 --> 00:20:04.624]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[00:20:04.805 --> 00:20:14.794]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[00:20:14.954 --> 00:20:16.896]  There is a solution that doesn't involve
[00:20:17.176 --> 00:20:17.516]  I think so.
[00:20:33.126 --> 00:20:36.528]  Then you're ready for Heart and Body Extract from Healthy Hearts Club.

[00:21:00.632 --> 00:21:02.333]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:21:02.634 --> 00:21:06.096]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:21:06.256 --> 00:21:08.158]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:21:08.738 --> 00:21:11.480]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:15.623]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding.

[00:22:00.957 --> 00:22:01.418]  Gold.
[00:22:01.758 --> 00:22:03.039]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:09.406]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:22:09.566 --> 00:22:13.389]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.652]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:22:15.692 --> 00:22:15.872]  Mint,
[00:22:16.212 --> 00:22:17.953]  Demand is at an all-time high.
[00:22:18.113 --> 00:22:25.838]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.501]  Berkey Water Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration available on the market.

[00:24:18.783 --> 00:24:22.104]  The media lying and saying that, oh, the protesters attacked police so they attacked them.
[00:24:22.144 --> 00:24:22.504]  No, they said no.
[00:24:43.681 --> 00:24:45.584]  Assembly anywhere in the city.
[00:24:45.684 --> 00:24:47.186]  No permits to protest.
[00:24:47.226 --> 00:24:50.530]  See, first they say, oh, you stood out your right to protest, but you gotta get a permit.
[00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.052]  Then they say, oh, we're not issuing a permit.
[00:24:52.797 --> 00:24:53.698]  Under special rules.
[00:24:54.058 --> 00:24:59.701]  Then they start attacking people and a few dozen stage-masked feds.
[00:25:00.221 --> 00:25:04.203]  Again, we caught them in Denver, caught them in Seattle, caught them in England, caught them in Canada.
[00:25:04.683 --> 00:25:05.484]  Mainstream news.
[00:25:05.684 --> 00:25:06.824]  I have seen the video.
[00:25:07.145 --> 00:25:09.426]  These are all big guys that are doing this.
[00:25:09.966 --> 00:25:12.467]  They are cops, are informants, period.
[00:25:12.507 --> 00:25:16.629]  And it always comes out a month or two later, but as minor footnotes in the newspapers.
[00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:19.111]  Not the big news, the big national news.
[00:25:20.399 --> 00:25:21.220]  So that is coming up.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.700]  I found the stack here.
[00:25:23.821 --> 00:25:24.842]  I found the stack.
[00:25:27.003 --> 00:25:28.844]  As world government is openly being announced.
[00:25:28.964 --> 00:25:31.065]  Obama set stage for new world order.
[00:25:31.305 --> 00:25:32.506]  USA Today.
[00:25:33.206 --> 00:25:35.548]  Community organizing the world.
[00:25:35.988 --> 00:25:37.269]  Another headline out of the trumpet.
[00:25:38.129 --> 00:25:38.890]  Press TV.
[00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:39.570]  Brazil.
[00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:41.931]  After new world order and economy.
[00:25:42.532 --> 00:25:43.192]  The Star.
[00:25:44.113 --> 00:25:44.913]  Out of Toronto.
[00:25:45.253 --> 00:25:47.775]  Changing power structure shapes a new world order.
[00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:50.929]  Then I printed off the actual Google list page.
[00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.510]  New Economic Order takes shape at G20.
[00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:54.390]  Reuters.
[00:25:56.391 --> 00:26:00.271]  G20 to police New World Economic Order.
[00:26:01.432 --> 00:26:03.292]  New World Order after Pittsburgh.
[00:26:04.212 --> 00:26:05.853]  In fact, guys, just print me all of these.
[00:26:05.913 --> 00:26:06.813]  I didn't even print these.
[00:26:07.113 --> 00:26:08.953]  The first block of articles that come up.
[00:26:09.213 --> 00:26:13.774]  It says 4,644 news articles.
[00:26:13.834 --> 00:26:17.735]  Now, because Google, that's just in the first bunch of New World Order headlines.
[00:26:18.695 --> 00:26:24.017]  And there's 4,644 in Google News articles with the title New World Order.
[00:26:24.297 --> 00:26:24.897]  Now, I'm sorry.
[00:26:26.097 --> 00:26:30.359]  I normally say, I see hundreds of New World Order articles a day or a week.
[00:26:31.099 --> 00:26:32.700]  That's me under-guesstimating.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.460]  Because there's no way to count all these.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.881]  People then send me emails going, they're not hundreds!
[00:26:37.261 --> 00:26:38.201]  You're right, I'm wrong.
[00:26:38.241 --> 00:26:39.342]  Let me correct myself.
[00:26:39.442 --> 00:26:40.582]  I really apologize.
[00:26:41.022 --> 00:26:43.283]  It's not hundreds, as I said at the start of the show.
[00:26:43.643 --> 00:26:43.743]  It's 4,644!
[00:26:46.463 --> 00:26:47.363]  In one news block.
[00:26:47.784 --> 00:26:51.665]  In a separate news block of the term New World Order, there's 394 in the second block.
[00:26:52.486 --> 00:26:54.026]  And then you go down to the next block, there's 109.
[00:26:54.527 --> 00:26:59.449]  And you go down to the next block for New World Order, there's 3,887.
[00:26:59.649 --> 00:27:03.251]  These are all different articles, so I'm sorry.
[00:27:03.651 --> 00:27:06.232]  There's, uh, looks like more than 8,000 here.
[00:27:07.072 --> 00:27:09.073]  I apologize, it's not hundreds.
[00:27:09.453 --> 00:27:09.694]  It's 8,000 plus.
[00:27:09.714 --> 00:27:09.874]  I mean,
[00:27:14.725 --> 00:27:18.988]  Every newspaper I went and looked at today said New World Order, most of them on the front page.
[00:27:19.329 --> 00:27:20.449]  And I am laughed at.
[00:27:20.469 --> 00:27:23.071]  I am made fun of.
[00:27:25.853 --> 00:27:30.477]  It is all a big joke to the yuppies that there's no New World Order.
[00:27:31.167 --> 00:27:34.269]  Ted Turner doesn't want to have a world government to curb population.
[00:27:34.289 --> 00:27:36.410]  They're not having secret population reduction meetings.
[00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:39.931]  Thousands of government documents don't say they're poisoning the water in vaccines.
[00:27:40.072 --> 00:27:41.512]  Of course, they really do say that!
[00:27:42.193 --> 00:27:44.054]  But it doesn't matter to the cops and military.
[00:27:44.314 --> 00:27:47.235]  It's too much fun to go out there and walk up to a woman.
[00:27:47.915 --> 00:27:49.796]  They went out to the Pittsburgh University.
[00:27:49.836 --> 00:27:50.857]  We've got video of this.
[00:27:51.517 --> 00:27:52.678]  And there's just students there.
[00:27:53.807 --> 00:27:58.351]  Uh, coming out of their dorms and coming out of events, and they just start beating the daylights out of them.
[00:27:58.371 --> 00:27:59.632]  People are like, why are you here?
[00:28:00.312 --> 00:28:02.094]  And they say, no assemblies allowed.
[00:28:02.114 --> 00:28:03.475]  They're like, this is the university.
[00:28:04.136 --> 00:28:06.157]  And the cop just hits her with a belly club.
[00:28:07.318 --> 00:28:08.679]  I mean, that's what America is.
[00:28:08.959 --> 00:28:18.447]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have videos up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com where... And there's hundreds of these YouTube videos.
[00:28:18.928 --> 00:28:19.668]  Probably thousands.
[00:28:19.728 --> 00:28:20.449]  I haven't counted them up.
[00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:21.430]  It's in the hundreds.
[00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.011]  I mean, I can't even watch them all.
[00:28:24.421 --> 00:28:33.907]  And you'll just see an empty street in the middle of a neighborhood and here comes a giant armored vehicle announcing no one is allowed on the streets, no congregations, no one.
[00:28:34.187 --> 00:28:37.008]  If you're on the street, no matter what your business, flee now!
[00:28:37.409 --> 00:28:39.530]  They go and they turn on the sound cannon.
[00:28:40.794 --> 00:28:42.435]  And then the person ducks back into the business.
[00:28:42.455 --> 00:28:43.676]  There's no one on the streets.
[00:28:43.876 --> 00:28:51.440]  We've got photos and videos of little kids in their front yards covering their ears as the sound cannon rolls by.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.762]  Just little kids in Pittsburgh at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:28:55.782 --> 00:29:02.066]  4 o'clock in the afternoon after school on a Thursday.
[00:29:03.667 --> 00:29:10.013]  Our guys are out there right now getting more footage of this and just little kids are out playing baseball or playing with a soccer ball.
[00:29:10.033 --> 00:29:15.277]  I mean, I'm talking, I got one photo where it looks like it's a nine-year-old kid and he's sitting there with horror.
[00:29:17.048 --> 00:29:18.169]  I found that last night with Aaron.
[00:29:18.189 --> 00:29:19.770]  He's not here yet, because we're up here until 2 in the morning.
[00:29:20.131 --> 00:29:22.112]  But as soon as he gets in, it's in Aaron's email.
[00:29:22.412 --> 00:29:28.557]  And it just shows a little kid, just in his front yard, looking with fear at the police driving by with a sound cannon, hitting him hard.
[00:29:28.577 --> 00:29:31.220]  Because the cops have been trained zero tolerance.
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:38.546]  The city code under Pennsylvania Patriot Act, that's what they call it there, says that you're not allowed to be outside your house.
[00:29:38.566 --> 00:29:39.566]  This is martial law.
[00:29:39.947 --> 00:29:41.108]  Hit that 9-year-old!
[00:29:42.794 --> 00:29:44.515]  And so they shatter his ear canal.
[00:29:44.875 --> 00:29:46.036]  He'll have permanent damage.
[00:29:46.076 --> 00:29:47.857]  But hey, all in a day's work.
[00:29:48.197 --> 00:29:48.977]  Well, don't worry, cops.
[00:29:48.997 --> 00:29:50.058]  They're gonna take your pension fund.
[00:29:50.078 --> 00:29:50.818]  Your bosses are.
[00:29:51.458 --> 00:29:52.339]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.859 --> 00:29:54.460]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:58.082]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.155 --> 00:30:03.738]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:04.158 --> 00:30:09.123]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.483 --> 00:30:11.245]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.545 --> 00:30:16.370]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:17.471]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.711 --> 00:30:18.472]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.832 --> 00:30:20.433]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.713 --> 00:30:21.553]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.794 --> 00:30:23.855]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.995 --> 00:30:25.096]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.336 --> 00:30:26.677]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.857 --> 00:30:31.940]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:35.322]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.723 --> 00:30:39.185]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.525 --> 00:30:40.506]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.746 --> 00:30:41.386]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.667 --> 00:30:42.567]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.767 --> 00:30:43.508]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.688 --> 00:30:44.529]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:47.551]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.831 --> 00:30:49.593]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:49.613 --> 00:30:50.533]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:01.673 --> 00:31:07.000]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.721 --> 00:31:13.068]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.609 --> 00:31:19.777]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:20.077 --> 00:31:21.917]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:22.057 --> 00:31:24.438]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.518 --> 00:31:35.460]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:38.980]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.381 --> 00:31:40.761]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:41.241 --> 00:31:47.462]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:55.915]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.416 --> 00:31:57.557]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.977 --> 00:31:59.258]  The people strike back.
[00:32:02.401 --> 00:32:03.562]  Remain in your houses!
[00:32:04.412 --> 00:32:09.558]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:32:10.179 --> 00:32:11.160]  Will they do it?
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:13.502]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:32:14.163 --> 00:32:20.090]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:21.931]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:32:22.812 --> 00:32:26.335]  Executive Order 10-9-90 locks down all highways.
[00:32:27.096 --> 00:32:31.379]  Executive Order 10-9-95 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:36.244]  Executive Order 10-9-98 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:32:36.884 --> 00:32:41.708]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:32:42.609 --> 00:32:50.735]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[00:32:51.035 --> 00:32:53.316]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[00:32:53.536 --> 00:32:56.438]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[00:32:56.598 --> 00:32:59.560]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[00:33:01.782 --> 00:33:06.325]  While you were sleeping... They came and took it all away.
[00:33:06.345 --> 00:33:10.568]  They came and took it all away.
[00:33:12.665 --> 00:33:19.289]  I'm looking at Google News at 8,000, roughly.
[00:33:19.929 --> 00:33:22.791]  It's more than that, but just on the first page.
[00:33:23.912 --> 00:33:27.374]  8,000 articles with the title, New World Order, in quotes.
[00:33:27.394 --> 00:33:27.374]  8,000.
[00:33:29.875 --> 00:33:33.658]  Headlines like, New World Order is born.
[00:33:34.939 --> 00:33:35.999]  President Obama.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.721]  Obama, President of the World.
[00:33:40.762 --> 00:33:41.963]  World Government is
[00:33:42.935 --> 00:33:45.416]  Here, world government has arrived.
[00:33:45.876 --> 00:33:49.356]  G-22 police new economic order.
[00:33:50.677 --> 00:33:51.597]  That's the one in Telegraph.
[00:33:53.257 --> 00:33:56.398]  Reuters, new world economic order takes shape at G-20.
[00:33:56.558 --> 00:33:59.558]  Emergence of G-20 signals new world order.
[00:34:01.279 --> 00:34:04.399]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[00:34:04.599 --> 00:34:12.741]  Maybe I should just sit here for the next four hours or the three and a half hours we got left, roughly, and just read a thousand headlines for you.
[00:34:14.065 --> 00:34:15.406]  I mean, there is a world government.
[00:34:15.466 --> 00:34:16.706]  It is run by private banks.
[00:34:17.787 --> 00:34:32.433]  We have let a group of private banking families control the treasury departments of almost every major nation on earth and the G20, and they have issued themselves tens of trillions of dollars a year in fiat currency and credit to buy everything up.
[00:34:34.854 --> 00:34:41.737]  The resources, the media companies, the militaries, the governments, and everyone just bows down to con artists.
[00:34:42.992 --> 00:35:05.181]  John D. Rockefeller, the big patriarch of the Rockefeller family, 150-something years ago when he got going, his father, talk about a devilish looking guy with this big beard, you can pull up the Rockefeller family history online and look at him, he was a snake oil salesman that made a whole bunch of money selling opium as a cure-all in bottles.
[00:35:06.903 --> 00:35:12.464]  And then he was the first snake oil salesman to not just send out a wagon himself and go town to town.
[00:35:12.964 --> 00:35:14.744]  He thought, I'll franchise this.
[00:35:15.124 --> 00:35:18.985]  I'll have warehouses all over the East and the West as the railroads expanded.
[00:35:19.705 --> 00:35:24.866]  And he thought of branding and banners and the name of his company.
[00:35:25.166 --> 00:35:31.647]  And he sent out thousands of wagons on the trains to go to even the smallest towns selling snake oil.
[00:35:32.087 --> 00:35:34.908]  And they made tens of millions of dollars
[00:35:36.045 --> 00:35:38.626]  In 1840s, 50s, and 60s money.
[00:35:39.307 --> 00:35:42.908]  And then when he died, he gave John D. every centella of it.
[00:35:43.288 --> 00:35:46.870]  And John D. struck oil and created a monopoly over that with Standard Oil.
[00:35:47.410 --> 00:36:01.437]  And John D. then hired Pinkerton Security to go out to small towns where people set up gold mines, and they would walk in, blow the sheriff's head off, kill the mayor, burn the town down, and bring in different mercenary forces.
[00:36:02.097 --> 00:36:04.098]  Now that's who set up the New World Order.
[00:36:04.901 --> 00:36:25.878]  They sent out wagons with opium, and they got everybody addicted to drugs, and they got filthy rich off that, and then they went out and took the gold mines, and took the coal mines, and they went out at gunpoint and took the silver mines, and they went out and took over the oil fields, and they rule this planet with the Queen of England and the Rothschilds, period.
[00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:34.165]  Because John D's daddy, I forget his name, do me a favor, pull up John D. Rockefeller, the first
[00:36:35.936 --> 00:36:37.916]  Father, it'll pull up, I forget his name.
[00:36:39.737 --> 00:36:41.777]  John D. Rockefeller's father, I forget his name.
[00:36:41.797 --> 00:36:45.378]  We go live at PrisonPlanet.tv next hour, we'll have that and have his name for it.
[00:36:45.778 --> 00:36:46.858]  The name escapes me at the time.
[00:36:47.058 --> 00:36:47.898]  But that's the history of it.
[00:36:47.918 --> 00:36:49.279]  I've studied it, read several books on it.
[00:36:49.839 --> 00:36:52.679]  And it's on the Rockefeller's own family website.
[00:36:52.759 --> 00:36:57.100]  I've got a PBS documentary about the Rockefellers made 15 years ago or so.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.121]  I guess early 90s more than that now.
[00:36:59.921 --> 00:37:01.441]  And they just brag about the whole thing.
[00:37:01.761 --> 00:37:03.241]  And all the famous cases.
[00:37:04.582 --> 00:37:05.262]  You ever seen that
[00:37:07.048 --> 00:37:08.008]  Clint Eastwood movie.
[00:37:09.689 --> 00:37:11.909]  It's not High Plains Drifter, but it's a similar one.
[00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:23.032]  It's the one where he goes into a little town and the local gold mining company brings in the regulators and start killing all the gold miners who won't hand over their land.
[00:37:23.552 --> 00:37:25.773]  That is based on a whole bunch of true stories.
[00:37:26.133 --> 00:37:28.634]  They did that in Oklahoma and Colorado.
[00:37:28.994 --> 00:37:30.094]  They did that in Texas.
[00:37:30.134 --> 00:37:31.495]  They did that in California.
[00:37:31.895 --> 00:37:34.655]  And they just walk right up to little kids and put a gun right to their head.
[00:37:34.896 --> 00:37:36.276]  In a famous case in Colorado,
[00:37:36.816 --> 00:37:37.936]  That happened in the last century.
[00:37:38.296 --> 00:37:44.378]  They came into a gold mining town, rode down the families, burned it down, shot little kids in the back, killed hundreds.
[00:37:46.658 --> 00:37:48.498]  There's just too many cases of this.
[00:37:48.819 --> 00:37:49.759]  And that's all they are!
[00:37:50.879 --> 00:37:59.621]  They're snake oil salesmen that took that money and learned how to create monopolies, and learned how to hire mercenaries.
[00:37:59.941 --> 00:38:03.882]  And what are they doing today with the mercenaries, with Blackwater, and all the rest of these companies?
[00:38:03.902 --> 00:38:04.962]  What are they doing to our nation?
[00:38:06.178 --> 00:38:07.339]  What have they turned us into?
[00:38:07.639 --> 00:38:08.900]  They own the private prisons.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.121]  They own the banks that launder the drug money.
[00:38:11.402 --> 00:38:13.483]  They control the conduits that ship the drugs in.
[00:38:14.764 --> 00:38:17.266]  They own it and run it and dominate it all.
[00:38:18.166 --> 00:38:25.351]  And if you look at David Rockefeller, he has funded hundreds of groups calling for world government.
[00:38:26.912 --> 00:38:35.458]  He makes George Soros look like a small-time amateur at running groups, and Soros funds hundreds of groups on record.
[00:38:36.041 --> 00:38:37.282]  Billions and billions a year.
[00:38:40.424 --> 00:38:42.126]  And this is how they dominate our planet.
[00:38:43.086 --> 00:38:44.347]  This is how they operate.
[00:38:45.028 --> 00:38:46.529]  This is how they get their job done.
[00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:53.975]  And now they've come into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and they're openly announcing that in the next two years they're going to go ahead and scrap the dollar.
[00:38:54.932 --> 00:38:58.333]  And when we lose the dollar as the world reserve currency, that's all we've got left.
[00:38:58.794 --> 00:39:00.374]  That's our export, is dollars.
[00:39:00.935 --> 00:39:17.762]  We don't really make anything, we don't really do anything except military and propaganda, and now we're going to lose the dollar, and on it they're going to have a new global system that regulates all the sub-currencies and sets the interest rates and the currency rates, and they're openly announcing in the news in thousands of articles.
[00:39:18.122 --> 00:39:20.243]  Thousands of articles today!
[00:39:22.102 --> 00:39:34.126]  Not hundreds, thousands today, and thousands yesterday, and thousands the day before, and thousands of articles the day before that, they say, we're setting up a new law, and what is that?
[00:39:36.869 --> 00:39:37.469]  And they brag.
[00:39:37.549 --> 00:39:42.292]  Obama says at the UN that a unipolar world is over, that the American empire is over.
[00:39:42.452 --> 00:39:42.852]  That's right.
[00:39:42.872 --> 00:39:46.114]  We have served our purpose to empower the world government empire.
[00:39:46.494 --> 00:39:48.155]  Now we recede into history.
[00:39:48.235 --> 00:39:48.835]  We are looted.
[00:39:48.895 --> 00:39:53.017]  We become a third world police state that just supplies military hardware and troops.
[00:39:55.098 --> 00:39:59.100]  And Europe and China become the center of the New World Order, along with Russia.
[00:39:59.641 --> 00:40:04.123]  And the global taxation system with the carbon tax is now being erected and set up.
[00:40:06.687 --> 00:40:08.588]  And they explain that that is what it means.
[00:40:08.968 --> 00:40:14.331]  The group of 20 rich and developing countries is to take on a new role as caretaker of the global economy.
[00:40:14.472 --> 00:40:20.935]  Oh, they'll be the caretaker, the London Telegraph says, giving rising stars such as China and India more say in world affairs.
[00:40:22.816 --> 00:40:24.217]  And Obama now chairs.
[00:40:24.757 --> 00:40:30.121]  You see, the 15-member rotating Security Council has always had the U.S.
[00:40:30.181 --> 00:40:31.381]  ambassador to the U.N.
[00:40:31.421 --> 00:40:33.863]  chairing it when it falls to the United States every 15 months.
[00:40:36.468 --> 00:40:42.692]  Because Article 1, Section 9 states the President can't serve a foreign government or corporation or swear an oath to any other group or take a title of nobility.
[00:40:45.674 --> 00:40:48.116]  Can't take a job as the chairman of the East India Company.
[00:40:48.436 --> 00:40:51.938]  Can't take a job, can't become knighted by the throne in all of its duties.
[00:40:52.319 --> 00:40:53.759]  Can't be part of another government.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.962]  Can't be a minister in the Austrian or the Chinese government.
[00:40:57.182 --> 00:41:00.144]  And you certainly can't be a minister in the G20.
[00:41:03.396 --> 00:41:16.947]  You certainly, and again that's the governmental chairs of the banking system of the nation states, and you certainly can't, as a president, be seated as the chairman of the UN Security Council and its 15 members.
[00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:23.773]  But President Obama did it, and he's now being called the President of the World.
[00:41:29.738 --> 00:41:30.579]  That's what they're doing.
[00:41:31.255 --> 00:41:32.375]  And he's setting the precedent.
[00:41:32.675 --> 00:41:37.937]  And that's why, and later we're going to play the video of this when we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv, but play the audio for radio listeners.
[00:41:40.477 --> 00:41:58.682]  That's why, whenever Obama two days ago gaveled in the UN Security Council, Henry Kissinger that was there, and Obama thanked him with his mouth hanging open, Susan Rice, US Ambassador to the UN, was in ecstasy behind him, Rahm Emanuel was in ecstasy, some of them
[00:41:59.716 --> 00:42:03.658]  General James L. Jones, the head of the National Security Council, the North Com Dictatorship.
[00:42:04.398 --> 00:42:06.099]  Rice was shaking.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.621]  Rice was in ecstasy.
[00:42:10.241 --> 00:42:18.885]  In fact, they admitted on CNN and Fox that everyone was twittering in the chamber and freaking out over him, quote, becoming President of the World.
[00:42:19.525 --> 00:42:21.146]  And that a new world order had been born.
[00:42:21.266 --> 00:42:26.269]  And Obama didn't look too excited when he was sworn in or gave a speech to be U.S.
[00:42:26.289 --> 00:42:26.649]  President.
[00:42:28.328 --> 00:42:29.248]  January 21st of 2009.
[00:42:30.469 --> 00:42:33.229]  But when Obama gaveled, his voice was shaking.
[00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:40.832]  He radiated a Hitlerian-type energy, that dictator energy I've seen out of Mao, Stalin, and Hitler.
[00:42:41.432 --> 00:42:45.633]  And he truly blazed with a demoniac glow.
[00:42:45.993 --> 00:42:47.173]  Go watch it for yourself.
[00:42:47.894 --> 00:42:56.096]  I mean, this was, at every instinctive and political and intellectual level in my soul and heart and mind and intellect, this really shook me in the last two days to watch this.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:14.288]  He is the prototype of things to come, but they're openly announcing world taxes, world regulation, shutting down our economy, kids tattling on their parents as climate cops, riding their parents' tickets from the public school, the public schools becoming the spy bases that take over the communities.
[00:43:14.428 --> 00:43:16.789]  It is all happening.
[00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:22.772]  What you're seeing is the complete destruction and fall of the Republic.
[00:43:23.593 --> 00:43:25.654]  Now, we can use this against them, though, like judo.
[00:43:26.246 --> 00:43:32.691]  They're openly announcing world government, openly announcing world taxation, openly announcing no free speech in major U.S.
[00:43:32.731 --> 00:43:42.217]  cities when any big event happens, sound canning nine-year-old children in their front yards and neighborhoods, driving down empty streets, announcing no one's allowed to be on the streets.
[00:43:42.518 --> 00:43:43.959]  That is classical martial law.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.281]  Invoking the Patriot Act of Pennsylvania.
[00:43:47.521 --> 00:43:48.582]  That's the code they're invoking.
[00:43:48.602 --> 00:43:52.465]  Pennsylvania was chosen for this meeting because it has the most draconian state laws.
[00:43:53.683 --> 00:43:56.545]  Remember back in 2003, they passed the Pennsylvania Patriot Act.
[00:43:56.826 --> 00:43:59.468]  It has the sneak and peeks, the secret arrests, the snatch and grabs.
[00:43:59.988 --> 00:44:12.159]  And the military is now snatching and grabbing, just pulling up, and randomly it appears grabbing peaceful protesters off the streets, but the police and the military are laughing, and it looks completely staged.
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:20.446]  But just setting that precedent of snatch and grabs, where they pull up in a van or a car, grab you by your shoulders, and drag you screaming into the vehicle.
[00:44:22.342 --> 00:44:24.264]  It is unspeakably evil.
[00:44:25.044 --> 00:44:35.493]  And they're setting these beta test precedents, just like they did in 99 with Seattle, saying no free speech allowed in the city, after they had 50 hired anarchists, staged attacks on police, and that was all declassified.
[00:44:35.814 --> 00:44:38.236]  Run by the Delta Force, the FBI, and the Secret Service.
[00:44:38.556 --> 00:44:43.600]  The G20 admits, and Pittsburgh admits that the Secret Service and Army are running this operation.
[00:44:44.001 --> 00:44:44.962]  Look at my reporters.
[00:44:46.002 --> 00:44:47.564]  Defense Link puts out a press release,
[00:44:48.408 --> 00:44:51.974]  Says that media can come talk to them, where they're massing at the National Guard Armory.
[00:44:51.994 --> 00:44:53.376]  They pull up the front gate, say hi.
[00:44:53.717 --> 00:44:56.521]  We're from InfoWars, we're from Chan... And they said, well, what's that on TV?
[00:44:56.862 --> 00:44:58.725]  Well, we're on Channel 10 in Austin and the radio.
[00:44:59.947 --> 00:45:00.628]  And they told him that.
[00:45:02.173 --> 00:45:04.796]  They laughed at him, came back, said, we want to talk to your boss.
[00:45:04.856 --> 00:45:05.757]  Then they got me on the phone.
[00:45:05.777 --> 00:45:07.378]  Then they laughed at us and said, get out of here.
[00:45:07.959 --> 00:45:08.980]  Maybe come back tomorrow.
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:12.283]  Then they call the police and say, people are at our perimeter sneaking around.
[00:45:12.323 --> 00:45:13.144]  They ran from us.
[00:45:13.505 --> 00:45:14.506]  We got their plate number.
[00:45:14.886 --> 00:45:19.771]  The police call us up on the cell phone they got from the rent car company posing as an Alamo rental car person.
[00:45:21.152 --> 00:45:25.557]  And say, we know you're a terrorist and you're never going to get off the terrorist watch list in your life.
[00:45:26.477 --> 00:45:27.197]  Laughing about it.
[00:45:27.518 --> 00:45:29.639]  This is the new secret police America.
[00:45:30.139 --> 00:45:34.341]  Nine-year-olds being hit with sound cannons by police in black uniforms in the army.
[00:45:36.122 --> 00:45:41.585]  Here's CNN crowing, but at the same time whitewashing, like, oh for a day.
[00:45:41.665 --> 00:45:44.926]  No, he's not head of the United Nations for a day.
[00:45:44.966 --> 00:45:49.909]  And if you study the UN power structure, the Secretary General is the head of the General Assembly.
[00:45:50.409 --> 00:45:54.371]  But of the 180 plus nations in it, only 15 have voting power.
[00:45:54.991 --> 00:45:56.072]  The real government
[00:45:57.486 --> 00:46:07.134]  It's not the shadow government, but it is, you don't really hear about it in the media much, but you notice one veto of one Security Council member can override the entire General Assembly.
[00:46:09.116 --> 00:46:15.201]  It's the real power, and Barack Obama is now the President of the UN, he's now the Chairman of the UN Security Council.
[00:46:15.481 --> 00:46:17.463]  Here is CNN, celebrating.
[00:46:18.664 --> 00:46:24.929]  Barack Obama caused some usually dull diplomats to come to life in the historic United Nations Security Council.
[00:46:25.504 --> 00:46:26.285]  Obama's U.N.
[00:46:26.345 --> 00:46:30.768]  debut created a stir, even in a room packed with heads of state and government.
[00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:38.053]  And for a couple of hours, you could say Mr. Obama was president of the world.
[00:46:38.434 --> 00:46:41.096]  Flanked by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.N.
[00:46:41.116 --> 00:46:52.144]  Ambassador Susan Rice, Mr. Obama used the United States' one-month council presidency to drive approval of a resolution aimed at putting more teeth into curbing the spread of nuclear weapons.
[00:46:52.637 --> 00:46:53.858]  Oh yeah, let's stop right there.
[00:47:19.574 --> 00:47:28.581]  How did they sell the League of Nations after the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and others, British intelligence on record, staged the assassination of the Archduke to start World War I?
[00:47:31.803 --> 00:47:33.365]  They said, we have to have this to end war.
[00:47:33.405 --> 00:47:34.425]  Then they got their League of Nations.
[00:47:34.445 --> 00:47:37.748]  Then they staged World War II, telling Hitler to go ahead and invade.
[00:47:37.788 --> 00:47:38.989]  That's now been declassified.
[00:47:39.489 --> 00:47:40.390]  They're setting him up.
[00:47:41.071 --> 00:47:42.852]  Not saying he's good, it's just the fact they set him up.
[00:47:43.482 --> 00:47:48.925]  That's why the Deputy Fuhrer Rudolf Hess flew into England with the treaty, saying, look, we signed a secret treaty.
[00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:50.806]  The King of England had to advocate.
[00:47:50.826 --> 00:47:51.607]  He'd been a Nazi.
[00:47:53.688 --> 00:47:55.349]  But now they've always pushed the UN.
[00:47:55.369 --> 00:47:58.451]  Oh, we got to have a world government, global governance to stop a nuclear war.
[00:47:58.771 --> 00:48:00.992]  All the globalists give nukes out to everybody.
[00:48:01.713 --> 00:48:02.533]  They gave it to Russia.
[00:48:02.573 --> 00:48:03.854]  They gave it to China on record.
[00:48:04.134 --> 00:48:05.175]  They gave it to Pakistan.
[00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:06.135]  They gave it to South Africa.
[00:48:06.155 --> 00:48:06.936]  They gave it to Israel.
[00:48:08.951 --> 00:48:11.753]  And now, oh, we gotta have a world government to stop nukes spreading.
[00:48:12.013 --> 00:48:15.175]  So that's just the front, but the real power they want is financial.
[00:48:15.835 --> 00:48:17.136]  Now, here is Obama.
[00:48:17.156 --> 00:48:24.701]  This is directly from the UN, gaveling in the Security Council as the President of the World.
[00:48:24.941 --> 00:48:25.362]  Here it is.
[00:48:25.382 --> 00:48:28.904]  That's the UN intro.
[00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:45.133]  The 6191st meeting of the Security Council is called to order.
[00:48:48.594 --> 00:49:09.064]  The provisional agenda for this meeting is before the Council in document S-slash-agenda-slash-6191, which reads, quote, maintenance of international peace and security, nuclear proliferation, and nuclear disarmament.
[00:49:10.737 --> 00:49:14.018]  Unless I hear any objection, I shall consider the agenda adopted.
[00:49:16.419 --> 00:49:17.239]  Agenda is adopted.
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:37.466]  I wish to warmly welcome the distinguished heads of state and government, the Secretary General, the Director General of the IAEA, ministers and other distinguished representatives present in the Security Council Chamber.
[00:49:38.186 --> 00:49:39.747]  Your presence is an affirmation
[00:49:40.196 --> 00:49:40.476]  All right.
[00:49:40.516 --> 00:49:45.521]  You can go watch hours of it online at the UN if you want.
[00:49:45.742 --> 00:49:49.886]  That's directly from the United Nations, what we just played.
[00:49:49.926 --> 00:49:53.269]  Now, he is the president of the world.
[00:50:03.436 --> 00:50:05.979]  And that's how this sick system works with the 15 members.
[00:50:05.999 --> 00:50:08.762]  They each get to be president of the world, and that's how they consider themselves.
[00:50:08.782 --> 00:50:10.384]  That's what they are openly announced as.
[00:50:12.827 --> 00:50:16.231]  And coming up in 15 months again, he will be the president of the world one more time.
[00:50:17.092 --> 00:50:20.396]  And in all the Financial Times of London headlines and a whole bunch of others,
[00:50:21.147 --> 00:50:24.770]  They say this is cementing world government, that Obama is bringing the U.S.
[00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:27.132]  into world government, that he is relinquishing U.S.
[00:50:27.172 --> 00:50:28.533]  control over the world government.
[00:50:28.994 --> 00:50:30.115]  It's well known the U.S.
[00:50:30.195 --> 00:50:31.336]  runs the world government right now.
[00:50:31.996 --> 00:50:39.002]  And it was the Pentagon in 1946 that created the United Nations at the Presidio Naval Base in San Francisco.
[00:50:39.463 --> 00:50:44.327]  The Rockefellers put the money up for it there, to lease the base, and in New York.
[00:50:46.028 --> 00:50:49.051]  And so, this is a
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.943]  Horrible day for our nation.
[00:50:52.484 --> 00:50:55.511]  Our military, our government, our traders, they've totally sold us out.
[00:50:55.852 --> 00:50:57.917]  And they're gonna steal everything that's even nailed down.
[00:50:58.197 --> 00:50:58.699]  You got that?
[00:51:01.292 --> 00:51:07.657]  CigarettesNational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[00:51:07.837 --> 00:51:09.398]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[00:51:09.518 --> 00:51:13.921]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[00:51:14.081 --> 00:51:21.607]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[00:51:21.767 --> 00:51:24.229]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire.
[00:51:24.389 --> 00:51:25.030]  I don't know.
[00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:50.430]  1-888-329-7064.
[00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:51.291]  1-888-329-7064 today.
[00:51:51.471 --> 00:51:55.413]  To purchase, you must be 18 or older.
[00:51:55.433 --> 00:51:56.954]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:56.974 --> 00:51:57.975]  A new world order.
[00:51:57.995 --> 00:52:06.481]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:52:07.401 --> 00:52:13.265]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:52:13.305 --> 00:52:15.407]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:52:16.087 --> 00:52:18.489]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:52:19.256 --> 00:52:26.569]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:52:29.605 --> 00:52:30.566]  Most people have no idea.
[00:52:30.586 --> 00:52:31.706]  They're not after money.
[00:52:31.746 --> 00:52:33.187]  They have all the money they need.
[00:52:33.428 --> 00:52:34.048]  They're after power.
[00:52:34.088 --> 00:52:35.249]  That's what they have to do.
[00:53:02.543 --> 00:53:05.164]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[00:53:05.604 --> 00:53:07.884]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[00:53:08.264 --> 00:53:11.565]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutroversal Foods.
[00:53:12.005 --> 00:53:18.366]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese, and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[00:53:18.686 --> 00:53:22.227]  Dig into our chili with cornmeal dumplings, and you'll feel like a wealthy Texan.
[00:53:22.587 --> 00:53:26.588]  Or sip a cup of warm potato cheddar soup and be soothed on a cold, rainy day.
[00:53:26.948 --> 00:53:30.249]  Nutroversal Foods from eFoods Direct, your new comfort food.
[00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:32.289]  Incredible taste, easy to prepare,
[00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:32.669]  We're good.
[00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:03.690]  I was a highway man.
[00:54:09.221 --> 00:54:12.582]  We're going under U.N.
[00:54:12.782 --> 00:54:13.123]  law.
[00:54:13.183 --> 00:54:17.584]  They're going to incrementally take all of your children from you.
[00:54:18.224 --> 00:54:25.227]  They're going to home inspect you every month for environmental and social issues.
[00:54:25.327 --> 00:54:33.750]  They're going to inspect your garage sales, give you $15 million fines, $100,000 fines first infraction, $15 million fines second infraction.
[00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:36.771]  They're going to have warrantless checkpoints taking your blood.
[00:54:37.458 --> 00:54:40.060]  They're going to continue to take your blood at birth under a U.N.
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:42.242]  program, 36 years old, putting a U.N.
[00:54:42.642 --> 00:54:46.486]  bioweapons registry for race-specific bioweapons.
[00:54:47.086 --> 00:55:03.520]  They're going to set up world government, they're going to carry out forced population reduction, they're going to put more poison in the water and food, more GMO, and they're going to just watch everybody die, everybody become mentally retarded, everybody literally just falling dead around you incrementally, testing it, gauging it.
[00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:10.423]  Until it's just completely normal that everybody has cancer, everybody's dying, and the globalists are just laughing and giggling and snickering about it.
[00:55:10.443 --> 00:55:12.864]  Yeah, that sounds like a nightmare.
[00:55:12.884 --> 00:55:13.324]  Well, it is.
[00:55:13.704 --> 00:55:14.685]  Hitler was a nightmare.
[00:55:14.745 --> 00:55:15.685]  Stalin was a nightmare.
[00:55:16.045 --> 00:55:16.805]  Mao was a nightmare.
[00:55:16.845 --> 00:55:18.886]  They were all funded by these people.
[00:55:18.946 --> 00:55:19.547]  Pol Pot.
[00:55:19.867 --> 00:55:20.287]  All of them.
[00:55:21.187 --> 00:55:22.588]  We have the government documents.
[00:55:22.608 --> 00:55:23.428]  We have the proof.
[00:55:23.728 --> 00:55:29.951]  It isn't just a world government that's going to tax you and run your life with Tobin taxes and money transfer taxes and carbon taxes.
[00:55:31.607 --> 00:55:40.190]  World government is only the tool, as John P. Holder in White House Science Czar says, the planetary regime is the tool to kill you!
[00:55:42.671 --> 00:55:58.757]  And the reason they may succeed is because it's so bold, it's so off the charts, it's so outrageous, it's so criminal, it's so corrupt, that they would openly in the last year, still over 50 trillion worldwide, 23.7 trillion,
[00:56:00.751 --> 00:56:01.952]  Again, that's a two-month-old number.
[00:56:01.972 --> 00:56:03.933]  It'll be 28-trill following the trend.
[00:56:04.194 --> 00:56:05.535]  Next time, 28-trill plus.
[00:56:07.957 --> 00:56:10.499]  I always underestimate what it's going to be next time they announce it every two months.
[00:56:10.699 --> 00:56:11.439]  We're due to hear.
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:14.221]  It's $23.7 trillion almost two months ago.
[00:56:14.281 --> 00:56:15.302]  We're due to hear the new number.
[00:56:15.703 --> 00:56:16.363]  And I cringe.
[00:56:17.864 --> 00:56:25.170]  And they just are openly stealing every Treasury blind, openly deploying police and military on the streets everywhere, openly coming in with tyranny.
[00:56:26.551 --> 00:56:30.394]  Now, if we speak out and point out that it's just a group of private bankers doing this,
[00:56:31.556 --> 00:56:32.597]  We can start reversing it.
[00:56:32.657 --> 00:56:36.339]  That's why one of our biggest hopes is Ron Paul's resolution to audit these people.
[00:56:36.639 --> 00:56:40.761]  Because we're starting the process and beginning to really draw blood in the fight.
[00:56:41.281 --> 00:56:45.324]  Really beginning to land some strong punches on the enemy that people are now going to wait.
[00:56:45.424 --> 00:56:46.464]  Banks run the country.
[00:56:46.644 --> 00:56:48.385]  Private banks control the government.
[00:56:48.666 --> 00:56:50.266]  All over the world, people are finding out.
[00:56:51.007 --> 00:56:54.609]  As the end the Fed movement goes global, then they're starting to get scared.
[00:56:54.649 --> 00:56:56.470]  That's why they're accelerating their program right now.
[00:56:57.216 --> 00:56:59.737]  They were trying incremental, but they were starting to fail.
[00:56:59.977 --> 00:57:01.737]  They realize they're now behind the eight ball.
[00:57:02.417 --> 00:57:04.438]  This is RED LEVEL EMERGENCY!
[00:57:04.758 --> 00:57:05.518]  This is real!
[00:57:05.638 --> 00:57:07.799]  Gut up and get educated about this stuff!
[00:57:09.959 --> 00:57:14.740]  I know that you want to rationalize and tell yourself this isn't true because it's scary, but listen!
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:15.841]  It is real!
[00:57:16.081 --> 00:57:23.242]  We've proven it's real in Endgame, and TerrorStorm, and the Obama deception, and all the mainstream news is now confirming everything we told you.
[00:57:23.543 --> 00:57:25.383]  But they put their own sick spin on it!
[00:57:26.937 --> 00:57:27.838]  And support us!
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:46.209]  That's why the establishment with the mainstream media and alternative media attacks Ron Paul, attacks me, attacks anybody that they know is effectively countering them to try to get everybody fighting with each other with divide and conquer instead of identifying the new world order.
[00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:48.191]  Ron Paul isn't the one raising your taxes.
[00:57:48.251 --> 00:57:50.652]  Ron Paul isn't the one bringing in a world carbon tax.
[00:57:50.712 --> 00:57:53.134]  Ron Paul isn't the one taking over our economy.
[00:57:54.034 --> 00:57:54.655]  Alex Jones
[00:57:56.463 --> 00:57:56.923]  That's me.
[00:57:57.623 --> 00:57:59.084]  I'm not the one that runs your life.
[00:57:59.204 --> 00:58:02.325]  I'm not the one that's putting cancer viruses in the vaccines and trying to make you take them.
[00:58:02.765 --> 00:58:07.727]  And so when the Feds try to get us all in fighting, realize that that's their attempt with COINTELPRO.
[00:58:07.747 --> 00:58:13.809]  And they also use just the general public's jealousy of anybody successful to play us off against each other.
[00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:16.950]  You ever seen crabs in a bucket if you're crab fishing at the beach?
[00:58:17.371 --> 00:58:20.032]  Put three or four in the bucket, they can climb out if they work with each other.
[00:58:20.052 --> 00:58:23.633]  But any crab that tries to climb out, they all run over and pinch him and drag him down.
[00:58:24.947 --> 00:58:35.636]  If we don't get over the crab-in-the-bucket syndrome... Well, you're gonna see what's gonna happen, but we are mounting a successful offensive against the enemy.
[00:58:36.117 --> 00:58:39.419]  We'll be right back with reports from the G20, from our reporters.
[00:58:42.422 --> 00:58:43.783]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.823 --> 00:58:46.786]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.623 --> 00:58:54.584]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.844 --> 00:58:56.624]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.864 --> 00:59:05.126]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:05.366 --> 00:59:10.608]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.928 --> 00:59:12.548]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.788 --> 00:59:19.109]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:19.309 --> 00:59:30.052]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:30.352 --> 00:59:30.872]  That's right.
[00:59:31.112 --> 00:59:33.432]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:59:33.672 --> 00:59:35.273]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:59:37.213 --> 00:59:37.854]  We're good to go.
[01:00:04.173 --> 01:00:08.356]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.016 --> 01:00:09.837]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.617 --> 01:00:11.638]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:11.878 --> 01:00:15.780]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.341 --> 01:00:20.403]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.862 --> 01:00:44.003]  We are live at the G20 Summit as open world government is being announced.
[01:00:44.823 --> 01:00:55.546]  President Obama has been announced as President of the World at the UN, and he legally taken the chairmanship of the UN Security Council, the only true governing body in the UN that has power.
[01:00:55.606 --> 01:00:59.626]  The General Assembly is a puppet, powerless assembly, and the assembly admits that.
[01:01:00.887 --> 01:01:03.307]  He's now more powerful than the UN Secretary General.
[01:01:03.947 --> 01:01:05.608]  He's now more powerful than the US President.
[01:01:05.628 --> 01:01:06.708]  He holds the dual post.
[01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:16.054]  Jason Douglas is with us live from protest in day two of the opening announcement for world government.
[01:01:16.354 --> 01:01:21.277]  At the end of the dollar, Jason Bermas is at another location.
[01:01:21.317 --> 01:01:26.860]  We'll go to both of them after the break when we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv with a complete report.
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:29.261]  Jason Douglas, what are you witnessing right now?
[01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:41.612]  Uh, right now I'm in the middle of the United Steelworkers Union, and, uh, there are so many groups here, all very disgruntled at what's happening with the current state of the world.
[01:01:42.212 --> 01:01:44.413]  We are just marching off the UPenn campus.
[01:01:45.313 --> 01:01:48.354]  Uh, I would estimate there's about 2,000 plus people here.
[01:01:48.374 --> 01:01:55.335]  It's still very peaceful, you know, people just speaking their minds and, uh, marching forward.
[01:01:55.415 --> 01:01:57.716]  Hopefully they're not going to use the sound cannons on us again.
[01:01:59.952 --> 01:02:06.477]  Well, just to be clear how this works, the city has said no protest allowed, no permits being issued, no First Amendment.
[01:02:07.158 --> 01:02:20.027]  And so right at the time the police are about to engage the peaceful people, 10 to 15 hired federal agents dressed as anarchists will tump over a few trash cans for a staged CNN, Fox News photo op.
[01:02:20.307 --> 01:02:22.049]  They will then attack the peaceful crowd.
[01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:24.811]  The police will with beanbags, rubber bullets,
[01:02:25.731 --> 01:02:30.313]  Pepper spray, CS, and the sound weapons.
[01:02:30.453 --> 01:02:31.613]  This is the MO.
[01:02:32.034 --> 01:02:48.220]  It's key, Jason, that you show people on video how right when the police arrive and try to block you and announce that it's an unlawful assembly, the public would see that on the news as abusive, unless the staged anarchists give them the pretext to attack.
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:48.960]  That will happen.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:50.581]  Exactly.
[01:02:52.222 --> 01:02:54.845]  They, um, are definitely looking for any sort of excuse.
[01:02:54.865 --> 01:03:02.091]  I mean, they're all battle-ready, and, uh, you know, most of every- people are just walking, walking around, speaking their minds.
[01:03:02.592 --> 01:03:11.681]  You do have these small enclaves of people that are, you know, they're pretending that they're really dissatisfied, but it's just obvious that they're hired.
[01:03:13.102 --> 01:03:14.864]  Where is everybody marching to?
[01:03:16.051 --> 01:03:17.933]  Uh, we're trying to make it to the convention center.
[01:03:18.293 --> 01:03:21.356]  They wouldn't even let the permitted protest go that direction.
[01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:25.540]  Um, you know, they're just ostriches with their head in the sand.
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:27.942]  Well, what I saw on the news is they're not allowing any protests.
[01:03:27.962 --> 01:03:29.583]  You're saying there is a permitted march?
[01:03:30.204 --> 01:03:33.066]  There was one on the 20th, and they wouldn't even let that one go.
[01:03:33.086 --> 01:03:37.010]  There wasn't even any one down at the convention center, but they still didn't let it go down there.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:51.691]  We've seen photos and videos of the sound weapon trucks, armored vehicles, even in neighborhoods, Jason, where there's literally one or two people on the street like a nine-year-old kid with a ball in his front yard and they still drive by and blast him.
[01:03:53.622 --> 01:03:55.204]  They're right by people's homes.
[01:03:55.304 --> 01:03:56.545]  I was standing by one home.
[01:03:56.565 --> 01:04:00.149]  It had, uh, you know, several family members out on the stoop with their baby.
[01:04:00.610 --> 01:04:01.911]  And they blasted the sound cannon.
[01:04:02.392 --> 01:04:05.475]  And it just feels like your eardrums are gonna blow out of your skull.
[01:04:05.535 --> 01:04:06.556]  So that is confirmed.
[01:04:06.636 --> 01:04:10.360]  Yesterday or today you saw them blast a family with a baby on their front porch?
[01:04:11.161 --> 01:04:11.741]  It's confirmed.
[01:04:11.821 --> 01:04:12.342]  I saw them.
[01:04:12.702 --> 01:04:14.024]  You know, they were blasting all of us.
[01:04:15.515 --> 01:04:16.616]  Well, this is unbelievable.
[01:04:17.196 --> 01:04:21.979]  I remember in Portland five years ago, an anti-war march.
[01:04:22.419 --> 01:04:25.801]  They came and blocked it in and came up and sprayed babies in baby carriages.
[01:04:26.141 --> 01:04:28.003]  And the mother said, why are you spraying my baby?
[01:04:28.043 --> 01:04:33.006]  And the policeman said, listen, you effing bleeper, you shouldn't bring a kid to a protest.
[01:04:33.046 --> 01:04:34.907]  So they love targeting children, especially.
[01:04:38.769 --> 01:04:40.411]  Well, what else do you expect from Satanists?
[01:04:41.451 --> 01:04:43.333]  Even if they don't know they're Satanists, that's what they are.
[01:04:43.453 --> 01:04:46.556]  Stay there, Jason Douglas, Rob Dood, with you.
[01:04:46.876 --> 01:04:49.979]  We'll also get a report from another area with Jason Burmas.
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:55.104]  Straight ahead, we're going live at PrisonPlanet.tv in T-minus three minutes.
[01:04:55.184 --> 01:04:56.785]  Stay with us in FullWars.com.
[01:05:00.754 --> 01:05:05.901]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:06.061 --> 01:05:07.964]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:05:08.124 --> 01:05:10.407]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:10.587 --> 01:05:12.430]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:14.232]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:14.492 --> 01:05:15.514]  There is a solution.
[01:05:15.734 --> 01:05:23.759]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:05:24.179 --> 01:05:31.243]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:43.250]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:47.473]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[01:06:00.663 --> 01:06:03.585]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:06:04.045 --> 01:06:07.206]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:06:07.667 --> 01:06:12.029]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:06:12.249 --> 01:06:17.832]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:06:18.132 --> 01:06:22.615]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:06:22.895 --> 01:06:25.957]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:06:26.518 --> 01:06:30.941]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:06:31.341 --> 01:06:37.645]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:06:37.905 --> 01:06:39.827]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[01:06:40.327 --> 01:06:42.068]  Toxins are in our foods, and chemicals are in our air.
[01:07:09.841 --> 01:07:11.642]  Chemicals are in our water supply.
[01:07:12.102 --> 01:07:17.246]  We purify our air, we purify our water, and yet we forget to purify our bodies.
[01:07:17.966 --> 01:07:22.669]  Funny, our bodies continue to absorb these deadly toxins and chemicals every day.
[01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:24.530]  Isn't it time to make a change?
[01:07:25.011 --> 01:07:26.211]  Maybe a life change?
[01:07:26.592 --> 01:07:28.773]  Get rid of toxins and chemicals.

[01:08:01.801 --> 01:08:07.824]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.425 --> 01:08:15.849]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.650 --> 01:08:19.871]  That is the sounds of the march.
[01:08:19.991 --> 01:08:27.015]  We estimate to be more than 2,000 people in Pittsburgh marching from the University to the Convention Center where the G20 is meeting.
[01:08:29.304 --> 01:08:31.746]  Jason Bermas is there at the head of the march.
[01:08:31.786 --> 01:08:33.527]  At the end of the march is Rob Dew.
[01:08:34.767 --> 01:08:37.029]  And Jason Douglas will be going to all of them.
[01:08:37.069 --> 01:08:40.111]  I'll be recapping all the big developments that have happened.
[01:08:41.231 --> 01:08:45.874]  They are using sound cannons even in neighborhoods on children and people on their front porches.
[01:08:45.894 --> 01:08:51.117]  They go into even small size streets and announce no one allowed on the streets, basically in Pittsburgh.
[01:08:51.998 --> 01:08:54.299]  They invoke the state's Patriot Act that they have.
[01:08:54.379 --> 01:08:55.380]  It's very draconian.
[01:08:56.931 --> 01:08:58.992]  It has been confirmed they're using sound cannons.
[01:08:59.052 --> 01:09:00.193]  Even CNN admits that.
[01:09:00.233 --> 01:09:03.334]  But neocon sites are denying it exists.
[01:09:04.175 --> 01:09:05.655]  Because they're basically pentagon run.
[01:09:05.695 --> 01:09:06.776]  That's a military tactic.
[01:09:07.016 --> 01:09:08.697]  They're still saying there's no New World Order.
[01:09:08.917 --> 01:09:10.538]  They're still saying there's no Bank of the World.
[01:09:10.778 --> 01:09:13.219]  They're still saying there's no global carbon tax in the media.
[01:09:13.659 --> 01:09:15.500]  As they simultaneously announce it.
[01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:17.681]  That's a psychological warfare tactic.
[01:09:18.161 --> 01:09:20.762]  To say, we're not assaulting you while they're assaulting.
[01:09:21.143 --> 01:09:23.984]  Mindless neocons claim G20 abduction video was fake.
[01:09:24.841 --> 01:09:25.961]  It is clearly not fake.
[01:09:25.981 --> 01:09:32.544]  These are real military officers and a real police crown vic jumping out and grabbing a protester and dragging him away.
[01:09:33.344 --> 01:09:43.208]  I'm saying that it could be staged in that it's real military, we know that, but that they could be staging snatching grabs as we know they did in Ottawa.
[01:09:43.288 --> 01:09:51.711]  The Royal Mounted Police have admitted last year that they staged an attack on their own police, then had to fake arrest the anarchist
[01:09:52.574 --> 01:09:53.815]  Put them into police cars.
[01:09:54.155 --> 01:09:55.836]  That's admitted Toronto Sun.
[01:09:57.577 --> 01:10:02.819]  But of course, the neocon websites are not going to admit that.
[01:10:02.839 --> 01:10:04.520]  They're just going to keep saying nothing's happening.
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:05.641]  There's no sound cannons.
[01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:06.961]  None of this is going on.
[01:10:07.062 --> 01:10:07.622]  Stand down.
[01:10:07.642 --> 01:10:08.462]  This is not an assault.
[01:10:08.802 --> 01:10:09.683]  Classic Pentagon.
[01:10:10.579 --> 01:10:11.400]  Uh, operation.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:19.404]  They're also, of course, saying that the video of sound cannons and police in black uniforms in the army, sound canoning people, including children, is fake.
[01:10:19.704 --> 01:10:31.050]  It's all admitted, but they're gonna make it about a debate of whether it's real or not, so we never psychologically have a debate on whether it's good to have the military sound canoning children and saying no protest allowed.
[01:10:31.450 --> 01:10:33.471]  They may even say Pittsburgh doesn't exist.
[01:10:33.751 --> 01:10:35.792]  They may even say Pennsylvania doesn't exist.
[01:10:36.032 --> 01:10:39.194]  So you will then debate with them that Pennsylvania exists.
[01:10:40.563 --> 01:10:45.609]  There are over 8,000 news articles today on Google News if you put the term New World Order in.
[01:10:45.989 --> 01:10:46.410]  Over 8,000.
[01:10:47.291 --> 01:10:50.614]  Openly announcing it's a global government, global tax, that the U.S.
[01:10:50.655 --> 01:10:55.600]  is going down, that Obama's great for being the new president of the world, chairing the U.N.
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:56.561]  Security Council.
[01:10:56.781 --> 01:10:57.142]  The U.N.
[01:10:57.182 --> 01:10:58.443]  Security Council exists.
[01:10:58.804 --> 01:10:59.865]  Obama exists.
[01:11:00.466 --> 01:11:01.447]  All of this exists.
[01:11:02.027 --> 01:11:09.533]  But if they can just keep saying it doesn't exist while they say it exists and it's good, then when you say I don't like it, they then say it doesn't exist.
[01:11:09.833 --> 01:11:12.335]  Burmas, that is classical psychological warfare.
[01:11:12.395 --> 01:11:16.178]  Jason Burmas reporting from the head of the march in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[01:11:17.788 --> 01:11:22.013]  Yes sir, right now it looks like a little over 2,000 people.
[01:11:22.673 --> 01:11:24.756]  They are condensed into one street.
[01:11:25.356 --> 01:11:29.621]  There seems to be much less of a police presence at Bismarck, at least at the moment.
[01:11:29.961 --> 01:11:33.065]  We're not really anywhere near downtown Pittsburgh yet.
[01:11:33.505 --> 01:11:38.567]  So we'll see what happens as we approach it if they let us go over into the downtown area.
[01:11:38.587 --> 01:11:39.907]  I highly doubt it.
[01:11:40.467 --> 01:11:44.929]  The downtown area is where you see the heaviest concentration of military.
[01:11:45.529 --> 01:11:48.330]  Right now I'm taping, and this is more of an eclectic group.
[01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:52.291]  Yesterday I didn't see any of the Iraqi war veterans against the war.
[01:11:52.531 --> 01:11:54.632]  Here I'm seeing dozens if not hundreds.
[01:11:55.452 --> 01:11:57.194]  I'm seeing around 100, 150 free to protestors.
[01:11:57.314 --> 01:12:04.580]  It seems like, you know, although there is an anarchist element here, they're somewhere towards the middle of the crowd.
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:09.364]  And we can only hope that they won't be able to provocateur the event today as they did yesterday.
[01:12:09.644 --> 01:12:14.669]  Well, what they're going to do is they're going to wait till you get to the place where the police are masked in front.
[01:12:15.369 --> 01:12:16.370]  And to the sides.
[01:12:17.010 --> 01:12:22.412]  Then once you get into the trap, police will come from behind.
[01:12:22.772 --> 01:12:27.594]  Then the anarchists for the news media will then come out of the middle, go to the front.
[01:12:28.475 --> 01:12:35.317]  They'll probably stage it with the police on a hill so they can roll a garbage dumpster at them for dramatic effect like they did yesterday.
[01:12:35.337 --> 01:12:43.841]  They'll then open fire with rubber bullets, pepper spray, and sound cannons on the 2000 so the media can replay yesterday and every other big event we've seen.
[01:12:44.562 --> 01:12:45.782]  Here's the key, Bermas.
[01:12:46.602 --> 01:12:48.263]  Jason Bermas reporting from Pittsburgh.
[01:12:48.643 --> 01:12:52.384]  We're going to play this video, which the neocons are saying is fake.
[01:12:52.404 --> 01:12:53.784]  They're saying it's not real military.
[01:12:54.104 --> 01:12:55.465]  It's clearly real military.
[01:12:55.765 --> 01:12:57.625]  They're clearly wearing the real badge.
[01:12:58.085 --> 01:13:03.426]  It's a plastic clear badge with a white badge for the police to recognize in the arm.
[01:13:03.807 --> 01:13:05.767]  It's clearly an unmarked Crown Vic.
[01:13:06.408 --> 01:13:06.889]  You can look.
[01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:07.829]  It's military.
[01:13:07.969 --> 01:13:09.391]  They're well-conditioned.
[01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:10.351]  They're in good shape.
[01:13:10.652 --> 01:13:12.293]  They're big military police cops.
[01:13:13.254 --> 01:13:16.997]  You see the classic hired informant types giving hand signals.
[01:13:17.017 --> 01:13:21.181]  When you watch the video, they're giving hand signals to the police
[01:13:22.122 --> 01:13:30.890]  Uh, and, and they, the guy is smiling and laughing and the cops are, just like the urban warfare drills they do, they then do the drills live action, but don't tell people they're drills.
[01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:39.518]  I'm almost sure watching this video as they throw him in, he's laughing, then the guy with him gives a hand signal to police, they drive off into tear gas.
[01:13:40.058 --> 01:13:50.690]  This is a PSYOP to sell people on the idea that the military pulls up and grabs you into a car, and that's how they protect their people that have just engaged in some type of violence.
[01:13:51.231 --> 01:13:53.994]  We didn't see that on the video, but the video is very short.
[01:13:54.274 --> 01:13:58.339]  That may have happened earlier for the police to have a pretext to crack down on people.
[01:13:58.599 --> 01:13:59.280]  Jason Burmess.
[01:14:01.594 --> 01:14:02.855]  Big possibility, Alex.
[01:14:02.915 --> 01:14:04.275]  Again, we're so far out.
[01:14:04.335 --> 01:14:07.237]  I mean, right now, I'm standing next to a bailout sign.
[01:14:07.937 --> 01:14:10.598]  They've got $12 trillion in counting.
[01:14:10.798 --> 01:14:14.740]  Of course, we know it's over $27 trillion at this point.
[01:14:15.501 --> 01:14:17.021]  This is a great turnout, Alex.
[01:14:17.121 --> 01:14:18.422]  I would really hate to see this
[01:14:19.483 --> 01:14:23.245]  Of course, we saw the chaos yesterday, and you know, I'm prepared for anything.
[01:14:23.265 --> 01:14:28.288]  Hopefully, I'm going to get to be able to talk to some of these protesters when we get down to the downtown area.
[01:14:28.568 --> 01:14:33.951]  But I am seeing a lot of signs that are really busting through the left-right paradigm.
[01:14:33.991 --> 01:14:40.015]  A few people have an amalgamation of both Barack Obama and George Bush as one being.
[01:14:40.035 --> 01:14:40.535]  They get it.
[01:14:40.835 --> 01:14:42.696]  They understand this war is not over.
[01:14:42.716 --> 01:14:43.957]  This war is not ending.
[01:14:44.337 --> 01:14:45.858]  The economy is only getting worse.
[01:14:46.078 --> 01:14:48.099]  We are moving towards global governance.
[01:14:48.439 --> 01:14:53.042]  Of course you have a lot of well-meaning idiots out here as well, but we can only hope to reach them, Alex.
[01:14:54.603 --> 01:15:08.611]  Well, we're playing video right now of last night at the university with police and military and military and riot gear with shotguns with rubber bullets that will kill you if they shoot you from five, ten feet away in many cases.
[01:15:08.631 --> 01:15:09.452]  There's been a lot of that.
[01:15:09.812 --> 01:15:14.495]  And they come up with a billy club and attack an innocent woman and tackle her for absolutely no reason.
[01:15:15.694 --> 01:15:26.623]  Well, you know, yesterday when I was able to catch the local news after everything had died down and basically we had been lured into a corner where we couldn't go anywhere for about an hour.
[01:15:26.683 --> 01:15:28.785]  They wouldn't let us over a bridge, even on foot.
[01:15:29.506 --> 01:15:33.389]  I saw this one girl, she must have been, you know, 100 pounds.
[01:15:33.549 --> 01:15:37.753]  I had interviewed her earlier in the day because she had a very provocative sign.
[01:15:37.793 --> 01:15:39.735]  She had a sign that said, smack an anarchist.
[01:15:40.255 --> 01:15:42.337]  And when I went and talked to her about it, she said, look,
[01:15:42.797 --> 01:15:51.603]  I'm all about free speech, I'm all about protesting, but when you get dressed up in black, and you put a black mask on, and you're here to destroy property, what is that going to accomplish?
[01:15:51.943 --> 01:15:57.106]  And I was like, right on, you know, you're dead right, you know, we have our freedom of speech, but those people aren't helping.
[01:15:57.407 --> 01:16:05.352]  And that's the girl they arrest, this girl with a sign, who is out there on her own trying to exercise her free speech, and enlighten people to the fact that, listen,
[01:16:05.732 --> 01:16:10.894]  You don't need to, you know, dress in all black and think you're a tough guy and follow along with the tours.
[01:16:11.174 --> 01:16:19.336]  For instance, Wendy Sheehan actually went to the anarchist meeting the night before last, before yesterday's protest, and was kicked out.
[01:16:19.356 --> 01:16:20.136]  They didn't want her there.
[01:16:20.396 --> 01:16:25.858]  They don't want legitimate voices amongst them because they know they control the idiot masses.
[01:16:27.685 --> 01:16:38.367]  Well, I'm watching the video of the guy that was arrested by the police after the military grabbed the one guy, and this looks fake to me.
[01:16:38.587 --> 01:16:40.448]  Clearly, with the other guy, it is fake.
[01:16:41.348 --> 01:16:47.229]  But if this person isn't an operative, he needs to later contact us and explain to us what happened.
[01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:55.050]  But talking to Douglas, talking to you, Burmas, Douglas has said it clearly looks staged with what he's seen.
[01:16:55.931 --> 01:16:57.311]  What do you think of these anarchists?
[01:16:58.137 --> 01:17:01.260]  Well, you know, I think a lot of them are just well-meaning idiots.
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:06.425]  However, the people in charge, the people that are directing them, obviously have an agenda.
[01:17:06.845 --> 01:17:14.532]  Um, you know, I got an interview with about 20 of the anarchists yesterday, prior to the march, and I mean, they were just, it was idiocy.
[01:17:14.572 --> 01:17:14.933]  I'm like,
[01:17:15.353 --> 01:17:19.075]  Well, what your group is called, Blotten, they were like, Team Spacebag.
[01:17:19.355 --> 01:17:22.557]  And I'm like, what does Team Spacebag even mean?
[01:17:22.577 --> 01:17:23.537]  And no one could tell me.
[01:17:23.557 --> 01:17:24.998]  They all just gave me a dumb look.
[01:17:25.038 --> 01:17:26.999]  They're just like, you're anarchy!
[01:17:27.419 --> 01:17:27.959]  Anarchy!
[01:17:28.059 --> 01:17:32.441]  And they said some other vulgar things, but none of the issues were being discussed.
[01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:37.544]  They had no other objective other than to be there and try to rebel against something they know nothing about.
[01:17:39.045 --> 01:17:56.754]  Well, that's how it works, is that we've been, and in the Fed protests and other places, and these anarchists will come in who are well-spoken, in good shape, and they'll say, come on, let's cause trouble, let's do something bad, and then in the Fed protestors have caught them later going, yeah, we can't get these people to even jaywalk, what are we gonna do?
[01:17:57.094 --> 01:18:08.040]  And over and over again, the Feds have been caught provocateuring, state police have been caught going into meetings and getting maybe one out of a thousand people in a warehouse to say they'll do something violent, and then they raid the whole facility.
[01:18:09.889 --> 01:18:13.012]  Absolutely, and again, we hope that doesn't happen again.
[01:18:13.112 --> 01:18:20.280]  I am seeing about a presence of about a hundred or so anarchists in the middle of the march in a concentrated area.
[01:18:22.401 --> 01:18:24.562]  Again, Alex, we'll see when we get down there.
[01:18:24.582 --> 01:18:27.203]  Right now, the police presence is very, very slim.
[01:18:28.064 --> 01:18:31.025]  The guards are not armed to the teeth as they were yesterday.
[01:18:31.305 --> 01:18:33.146]  I have yet to see any military.
[01:18:33.426 --> 01:18:38.589]  Really, the biggest concentration of riot police was at the university on the way in.
[01:18:38.609 --> 01:18:42.571]  Of course, this protest took place, started right around the corner.
[01:18:42.691 --> 01:18:44.393]  But Burmas, this is how it always works.
[01:18:44.433 --> 01:18:47.655]  They want the march concentrated, because it's easier to block in.
[01:18:48.136 --> 01:19:00.707]  Once you near your destination, that's when, watch, they're going to come out and block the street, then come in on the sides, let you fill up the pincer movement, and then they're going to close the gate on the back of you.
[01:19:02.034 --> 01:19:16.585]  Well, let's just pray and hope that they don't start shooting tear gas like yesterday, because I've got two two-year-olds passing me with their father right now, and I would hate to see these toddlers get into any kind of situation where they would be subject to abuse from riot police.
[01:19:18.446 --> 01:19:30.375]  And there's been a lot of tear gassing going on, a lot of microwave gunning going on, I mean, a lot of sound cannoning going on, and meanwhile the neocons are denying on their websites that any of this is even happening.
[01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:32.991]  Well, it's just incredible, Alex.
[01:19:33.051 --> 01:19:38.073]  I mean, I don't know how the mainstream media is going to cover this, but this is at least 2,000 people.
[01:19:38.093 --> 01:19:39.273]  This may be on the brink of 3,000.
[01:19:39.533 --> 01:19:45.636]  You know, just milling my way to the front of the line took me about 15, 20 minutes.
[01:19:45.796 --> 01:19:47.637]  Burmese, do we know why they attacked?
[01:19:47.737 --> 01:19:48.937]  I'm going to ask this when we come back.
[01:19:48.997 --> 01:19:49.978]  I'm going to ask Douglas as well.
[01:19:49.998 --> 01:19:51.018]  Stay there, Jason Douglas.
[01:19:51.378 --> 01:19:54.860]  Also, in another area of the march, why did they attack the university last night?
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.441]  I mean, I've got video of them attacking frat kids.
[01:20:02.785 --> 01:20:07.770]  Hey everybody, this is Stephen Baldwin, and if your daily vitamin is in pill form, you're wasting a lot of your money.
[01:20:08.110 --> 01:20:10.893]  Put all that stuff away and call my friends at Choose for Health.
[01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:15.757]  They've created a unique, chewable supplement that has 16 ingredients your body needs most.
[01:20:16.178 --> 01:20:19.681]  Antioxidants, sea vegetables, and super fruit complexes.
[01:20:20.061 --> 01:20:22.864]  And being a chewable, it's more quickly absorbed into your system.
[01:20:23.244 --> 01:20:25.566]  Not pass through it like all those pills you've been taking.
[01:20:25.947 --> 01:20:26.967]  Save yourself some money.
[01:20:27.248 --> 01:20:30.531]  Do what I did and get 16 useful ingredients in one product.
[01:20:30.751 --> 01:20:31.812]  You won't regret the decision.

[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:54.840]  Thanks!
[01:21:02.017 --> 01:21:02.858]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:21:03.038 --> 01:21:08.382]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:21:08.582 --> 01:21:09.002]  I get it.
[01:21:09.123 --> 01:21:18.510]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:19.911]  That's not what's happening.
[01:21:20.151 --> 01:21:28.399]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:21:28.619 --> 01:21:31.902]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:21:32.022 --> 01:21:36.086]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:21:36.286 --> 01:21:37.848]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:21:37.888 --> 01:21:41.131]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:21:41.852 --> 01:21:45.455]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:21:45.655 --> 01:21:46.355]  You should, too.
[01:21:46.535 --> 01:21:47.516]  Find out what they know.
[01:21:47.696 --> 01:21:51.817]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:21:51.837 --> 01:21:54.537]  800-686-2237.
[01:21:54.557 --> 01:21:55.838]  800-686-2237.
[01:21:56.858 --> 01:21:57.158]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:21:57.178 --> 01:22:07.241]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.701 --> 01:22:14.743]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:22:15.276 --> 01:22:21.501]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:21.861 --> 01:22:23.703]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:23.843 --> 01:22:26.265]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:26.345 --> 01:22:37.314]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:37.914 --> 01:22:39.215]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:39.575 --> 01:22:40.956]  It's about a one world government.
[01:22:41.436 --> 01:22:47.760]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:56.125]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:56.605 --> 01:22:57.746]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:58.186 --> 01:22:59.447]  The people strike back.
[01:23:01.288 --> 01:23:03.589]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes
[01:23:06.468 --> 01:23:06.789]  I think so.
[01:23:22.517 --> 01:23:22.857]  I think so.
[01:23:51.010 --> 01:23:53.734]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:23:53.754 --> 01:23:54.415]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today!
[01:24:09.599 --> 01:24:22.848]  Alright, we're now going to Jason Douglas who's with Rob Due in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, another area of the 2,000 plus people that we estimate are marching right now from Pitt, there in Pittsburgh, into another area of the city.
[01:24:23.168 --> 01:24:25.590]  Where again are you guys marching, Jason Douglas?
[01:24:27.011 --> 01:24:30.112]  Right now we are at Seneca Street and Fifth Avenue.
[01:24:31.573 --> 01:24:34.253]  We're in between the Convention Center and UPenn.
[01:24:35.694 --> 01:24:37.094]  And we're still formed in one group.
[01:24:37.134 --> 01:24:38.555]  They haven't splintered us off yet.
[01:24:38.775 --> 01:24:42.616]  And there's really been minimal police in comparison to yesterday.
[01:24:45.537 --> 01:24:51.979]  Usually they attack on the first official day because they want to set the precedent that protesting is bad and you're violent and bad.
[01:24:52.919 --> 01:24:55.300]  But I think you're going to see even more tonight coming up.
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:56.100]  Continue.
[01:24:57.928 --> 01:25:05.351]  Um, basically I have a feeling that they're funneling us into someplace, so then they'll start to splinter us off, and then they'll close the gate, just like they did yesterday.
[01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:08.052]  Yeah, that's the standard operating procedure.
[01:25:08.072 --> 01:25:09.093]  They may do something else.
[01:25:09.773 --> 01:25:17.536]  You've said on air, but can you elaborate that these people, these anarchists, act and behave like feds, the few engaged in violence?
[01:25:18.508 --> 01:25:25.052]  Right, well, basically you have a large group of people dressed in black with black masks and, you know, all saying anarchist type stuff.
[01:25:25.452 --> 01:25:33.337]  You can tell that the larger group, you know, it's people that just want something else besides what we have right now and are looking to anything.
[01:25:33.677 --> 01:25:45.905]  But then you have these capos that are basically in control of the larger group and they're doing paramilitary stuff where, you know, they're basically funneling people
[01:25:46.606 --> 01:25:51.701]  They're obviously working in coordination and then they do these spurts of violence.
[01:25:53.085 --> 01:25:54.028]  It's just provocation.
[01:25:55.177 --> 01:25:59.699]  I'm watching video from Pitt last night with the sound cannons hitting people.
[01:26:00.779 --> 01:26:03.320]  It's just unbelievably hardcore for the radio listeners.
[01:26:04.841 --> 01:26:11.683]  You can go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and watch all these scores of videos we have posted to give you different snapshots of what happened.
[01:26:12.064 --> 01:26:17.346]  We're also streaming this live at PrisonPlanet.tv right now, the video, but it's just
[01:26:19.076 --> 01:26:20.957]  Jason, I want these nighttime shots.
[01:26:21.017 --> 01:26:25.841]  The Darth Vader element of it is incredibly cinematic to get the point across in the next film.
[01:26:26.621 --> 01:26:29.303]  The Darth Vader... We were actually out last night.
[01:26:29.363 --> 01:26:33.006]  We drove right by the area that they said all the violence took place.
[01:26:33.926 --> 01:26:38.132]  And once started, we were thinking we were just there.
[01:26:38.452 --> 01:26:43.820]  So if an event happened, it was a coordinated event with the police and with the military.
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.403]  Because it happened in 15 minutes.
[01:26:46.864 --> 01:26:50.028]  Here they are attacking some girl that's gotta weigh 95 pounds.
[01:26:50.729 --> 01:26:51.950]  She seems disoriented.
[01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:53.711]  The sound cannons are going off.
[01:26:53.731 --> 01:26:55.192]  She's asking, please don't hurt me.
[01:26:55.832 --> 01:26:57.633]  And then they just absolutely attack her.
[01:26:57.733 --> 01:26:58.113]  Boom!
[01:26:58.414 --> 01:26:59.574]  Billy club to the head.
[01:26:59.955 --> 01:27:00.255]  Boom!
[01:27:00.275 --> 01:27:01.195]  They pull her to the ground.
[01:27:01.656 --> 01:27:04.477]  Giant 250 pound man piles on top of her.
[01:27:04.877 --> 01:27:06.919]  The Darth Vader's continue stomping past.
[01:27:08.339 --> 01:27:09.140]  Unbelievable.
[01:27:11.778 --> 01:27:14.460]  Yeah, how they're treating us is pretty crazy.
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:18.922]  And actually... And the cops love bugging their eyes out at everybody with pure hatred.
[01:27:18.942 --> 01:27:21.563]  I mean, they've really been trained to hate the citizenry of this nation.
[01:27:21.583 --> 01:27:24.045]  Well, the thing is... You better get that camera out of my face.
[01:27:24.065 --> 01:27:25.165]  It's like they're two different people.
[01:27:25.486 --> 01:27:26.726]  It's like they're two different people.
[01:27:26.746 --> 01:27:29.888]  When they're in the line, they have a completely banked stare.
[01:27:30.168 --> 01:27:32.790]  You know, you can tell they're combat hard, but...
[01:27:33.650 --> 01:27:41.252]  I've actually caught behind the lines, like just the guys, once they become guys and they just start talking to each other, they're questioning their order.
[01:27:41.692 --> 01:27:47.553]  They're actually, I heard some people saying something like, you know, these people are just, you know, want to be heard.
[01:27:48.134 --> 01:27:50.414]  Why can't, why can't they just let them speak?
[01:27:51.334 --> 01:27:53.075]  So there is dissension in the race.
[01:27:53.535 --> 01:27:57.136]  Um, we are having an effect out here.
[01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:04.585]  Well, the cops usually figure out later that there were provocateurs hired by the feds in there.
[01:28:04.605 --> 01:28:06.207]  Again, it's happened all over the nation.
[01:28:06.247 --> 01:28:15.036]  People that aren't aware of that latest incident was Denver Post reported on what happened last year at the DNC in Denver.
[01:28:15.297 --> 01:28:18.100]  The police were posing as anarchists attacking other police.
[01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:21.964]  They also hire informants, federal informants, state informants.
[01:28:22.714 --> 01:28:30.419]  We've got Bob Chapman coming up for 30 minutes to break down what's happening with the economy and what the G20 is announcing they want to do with the economy.
[01:28:30.899 --> 01:28:39.164]  But I want to check back in with you guys in the last hour today, 3 o'clock Eastern, 2 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[01:28:39.204 --> 01:28:43.087]  And I also want to talk to Rob Dew at that time and check back in with Burmese.
[01:28:43.427 --> 01:28:44.828]  Thank you so much, Jason Douglas.
[01:28:44.888 --> 01:28:48.850]  Call us if any new developments happen or if they start closing the gap on you.
[01:28:50.391 --> 01:28:56.193]  Before 3 o'clock, if anything happens, which probably will, call in and we'll preempt programming to bring you up, okay?
[01:28:56.634 --> 01:29:00.355]  Okay, I'm going to head to the head of the line and see if I can catch him when it happens.
[01:29:00.375 --> 01:29:00.555]  Hold on.
[01:29:00.575 --> 01:29:01.276]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:02.236]  Don't hang up though.
[01:29:02.276 --> 01:29:08.618]  I need to talk to Rob Due because he set up our next guest and we're having some conflicting issues here and it's been hard to get a hold of him.
[01:29:08.638 --> 01:29:13.280]  So I need you to get Rob Due so I can talk to him on the phone during this three minute break, okay?
[01:29:14.041 --> 01:29:15.501]  Okay, I will try to find him.
[01:29:15.521 --> 01:29:18.122]  There's a lot of people here and we separated to do coverage.
[01:29:19.403 --> 01:29:19.783]  Oh, man.
[01:29:20.652 --> 01:29:22.573]  And we can't get him to answer his phone.
[01:29:23.933 --> 01:29:25.614]  Yeah, I don't know what's going on with his phone.
[01:29:25.654 --> 01:29:27.075]  My phone's having a lot of problems, too.
[01:29:27.115 --> 01:29:34.138]  It seems like Pittsburgh only has one carrier, and so everybody else that's not on that carrier is having problems receiving phone calls.
[01:29:34.158 --> 01:29:35.958]  Well, the feds are known to jam them, too, at demonstrations.
[01:29:36.119 --> 01:29:40.200]  Look... Alright, I'll talk to you during the break.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:43.482]  We'll... He's normally radio producing, doing some of that here.
[01:29:43.502 --> 01:29:45.442]  We'll try to figure that out, as well.
[01:29:45.923 --> 01:29:47.823]  I'm trying to get a hold of him since 9 o'clock this morning.
[01:29:48.204 --> 01:29:48.744]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:51.656 --> 01:29:54.637]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.578 --> 01:29:58.339]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:04.121]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.521 --> 01:30:09.503]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.863 --> 01:30:11.604]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.904 --> 01:30:16.726]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.906 --> 01:30:17.846]  How much do you want?
[01:30:18.086 --> 01:30:18.847]  When do you want it?
[01:30:19.207 --> 01:30:20.808]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:21.088 --> 01:30:21.929]  When will you need it?
[01:30:22.169 --> 01:30:24.230]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.370 --> 01:30:25.471]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.711 --> 01:30:27.052]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:27.232 --> 01:30:32.316]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.516 --> 01:30:35.698]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:36.098 --> 01:30:39.561]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.901 --> 01:30:40.902]  How much will you need?
[01:30:41.122 --> 01:30:41.743]  We don't know.
[01:30:42.043 --> 01:30:42.944]  How much do you want?
[01:30:43.145 --> 01:30:43.865]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.885 --> 01:30:44.907]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:45.167 --> 01:30:47.930]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:48.210 --> 01:30:49.972]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:49.992 --> 01:30:50.913]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.598 --> 01:31:05.765]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.905 --> 01:31:10.271]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:10.431 --> 01:31:12.294]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.714 --> 01:31:14.056]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:14.336 --> 01:31:15.378]  There is a solution.
[01:31:15.598 --> 01:31:23.624]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:31:24.025 --> 01:31:31.130]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:31:31.470 --> 01:31:37.135]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:31:37.515 --> 01:31:38.775]  I love their Nutri-Cafe.
[01:31:39.055 --> 01:31:43.056]  Great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:31:43.517 --> 01:31:47.338]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:31:47.678 --> 01:31:54.339]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.
[01:31:54.359 --> 01:31:54.820]  866-762-9238.
[01:31:55.140 --> 01:31:58.480]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:32:02.862 --> 01:32:04.022]  Remain in your houses.
[01:32:04.875 --> 01:32:10.020]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[01:32:10.641 --> 01:32:11.622]  Will they do it?
[01:32:12.002 --> 01:32:13.944]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[01:32:14.605 --> 01:32:20.571]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[01:32:21.071 --> 01:32:22.412]  Think it can't happen here?
[01:32:23.253 --> 01:32:26.795]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[01:32:27.556 --> 01:32:31.839]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[01:32:32.439 --> 01:32:36.703]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[01:32:37.343 --> 01:32:42.167]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[01:32:43.067 --> 01:32:51.199]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.

[01:32:57.067 --> 01:32:59.991]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[01:33:15.075 --> 01:33:15.936]  We are live.
[01:33:16.016 --> 01:33:17.577]  It is Thursday, October 8, 2009.
[01:33:17.978 --> 01:33:21.861]  I'm Alex Jones, joining you from the road.
[01:33:21.881 --> 01:33:31.269]  Things like two or three times a year, I take a couple days off with the family, and that's always when massive news happens, so most of the time I end up being live here.
[01:33:31.329 --> 01:33:33.771]  Regardless, we've got Dave Mustaine coming up.
[01:33:33.791 --> 01:33:35.632]  People really requested to hear that interview again.
[01:33:35.652 --> 01:33:37.374]  A lot of people missed it when it was live.
[01:33:38.235 --> 01:33:38.975]  That's coming up.
[01:33:39.576 --> 01:33:41.938]  We have a lot of other news coming up in the final hour today.
[01:33:43.831 --> 01:33:44.891]  But it really doesn't matter.
[01:33:45.091 --> 01:33:58.415]  I was listening via my iPhone over Flycast to the radio show today, and it didn't matter if it was a show from two and a half weeks ago or two weeks ago, because it was just as pertinent.
[01:33:58.895 --> 01:34:01.256]  I was talking about how the G20 is meeting now.
[01:34:01.596 --> 01:34:02.936]  They're having private meetings.
[01:34:02.956 --> 01:34:05.037]  They're having public meetings for our consumption.
[01:34:05.557 --> 01:34:09.578]  And when they're in public meetings saying, we want world government,
[01:34:10.868 --> 01:34:12.168]  We want to get rid of the dollar.
[01:34:12.208 --> 01:34:21.590]  We want to have a new bank of the world that controls the currency taxes and the Tobin taxes and the oil taxes and the carbon taxes when they're publicly saying that.
[01:34:22.410 --> 01:34:27.391]  And talking about getting rid of the dollar, you better believe in the private meetings they're figuring out how to deep sex it.
[01:34:27.991 --> 01:34:31.352]  And so there have been three G20 meetings in the last year.
[01:34:32.172 --> 01:34:36.293]  And these have all been more important than Bretton Woods that put us on the dollar system.
[01:34:38.041 --> 01:34:47.043]  So this is a seismic shift, because first the fiat money masters got us deep in debt, got us on a fiat system, got us addicted to credit.
[01:34:47.383 --> 01:34:54.924]  They created more debt, between 500 and 1,000 times, more fiat debt than there was real assets in the world.
[01:34:55.984 --> 01:35:06.026]  And that's fine in the first phases, because it allows the private banks a select few to buy up the roads, the infrastructure, the ports, the ships, the factories, the military, the media.
[01:35:06.835 --> 01:35:09.918]  And then they get us deep in debt with our own fiat currency.
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:15.064]  Now, as you know, we've loaned $23.7 trillion, and that's a two-month-old number.
[01:35:15.084 --> 01:35:16.726]  It's probably over $28 trillion right now.
[01:35:17.246 --> 01:35:22.152]  Since October 3rd, we've now passed the anniversary of the banker takeover last week.
[01:35:24.258 --> 01:35:28.541]  And so now they are preparing to set up the private New World Order.
[01:35:28.901 --> 01:35:35.406]  It's already set up, but they're unveiling it, like when they unveil a new ship and chop the blocks and launch it into the ocean.
[01:35:35.646 --> 01:35:38.287]  Have you ever seen a huge ship being built at dry dock?
[01:35:38.848 --> 01:35:46.473]  And then the old-fashioned way, they'd hack out the big blocks under it and it would slide down a ramp into the channel to enter the open ocean.
[01:35:47.543 --> 01:35:48.163]  And they've done that.
[01:35:48.203 --> 01:35:49.704]  They've unveiled their world government.
[01:35:50.465 --> 01:35:58.209]  A lot of us went behind the curtain, peeked at it, read their own documents, their own blueprints, old-timers 50 years ago have all been proven exactly right.
[01:35:59.070 --> 01:36:00.430]  And we told you what was going to happen.
[01:36:00.951 --> 01:36:01.831]  We were behind the curtain.
[01:36:02.151 --> 01:36:03.472]  Now they've taken the curtain back.
[01:36:03.552 --> 01:36:04.673]  They admit what it is.
[01:36:04.853 --> 01:36:06.093]  It's an absolute nightmare.
[01:36:06.474 --> 01:36:08.075]  Citizens spying on everybody.
[01:36:08.555 --> 01:36:11.256]  Children being taken for absolutely no reason.
[01:36:11.356 --> 01:36:13.338]  The state raising everyone.
[01:36:13.418 --> 01:36:15.619]  Cameras in all the homes watching everyone.
[01:36:16.903 --> 01:36:17.664]  It is now here.
[01:36:18.465 --> 01:36:20.086]  And they mean bloody business.
[01:36:20.246 --> 01:36:21.287]  They're not playing games.
[01:36:21.587 --> 01:36:25.251]  And here's the key, though, as Ron Paul and many others have said for a long time.
[01:36:25.271 --> 01:36:29.214]  In fact, he says it in my film Matrix of Evil from 2004, Cicero.
[01:36:31.076 --> 01:36:40.604]  Ron Paul makes the point that when they implode the global economy, they're going to try to offer the solution of a total world government openly run by private banks as the solution.
[01:36:41.545 --> 01:36:43.107]  And here we are, five, six years later,
[01:36:44.108 --> 01:36:46.010]  Shot it in 2003, put out in 2004.
[01:36:46.230 --> 01:36:47.571]  The point is, he said it in 2003.
[01:36:47.871 --> 01:36:52.935]  Here we are five years later, and exactly that is now coming to fruition.
[01:36:52.995 --> 01:37:02.222]  Not because we're psychic or have crystal balls, but because the enemy has been quite public in their memorandums and white papers to each other, just not to the general public.
[01:37:02.282 --> 01:37:06.506]  So, now they're unveiling their monstrosity
[01:37:07.378 --> 01:37:31.532]  But, instead of letting them create the crisis and then offer the solution, if we, like the little boy pointing out that the emperor's butt naked, and that he isn't wearing fine clothes, the parable of the emperor's new clothes, if we all simply point out the Federal Reserve is the real governorship of this regional North American system, if we point out the private bankers are the source of our misery, if we point out that they are the social engineers,
[01:37:32.463 --> 01:37:39.907]  Who create the trillions in fiat currency to take over the planet through fraud, but they're all a bunch of Madoffs slash Ken Lay types.
[01:37:39.927 --> 01:37:44.969]  I mean, Madoffs started the Nasdaq, the second biggest stock exchange in the world.
[01:37:45.429 --> 01:37:46.770]  That's who these people are.
[01:37:47.090 --> 01:37:52.773]  Just because they wear fancy suits and have Ivy League educations, the police, the military fall down and worship them.
[01:37:53.233 --> 01:37:54.073]  So here's the choice.
[01:37:54.153 --> 01:37:55.214]  The Republic falls.
[01:37:55.794 --> 01:37:57.355]  Our liberties are completely destroyed.
[01:37:58.735 --> 01:37:59.996]  Total tyranny comes in.
[01:38:01.605 --> 01:38:21.420]  Or we stand up to the criminals, rebuke them, expose them with pamphlets posted around town, with calls to talk radio, with websites, with going to your congressman everywhere they go, every time they have a town hall, going to their office, beating the drum, going to city council, going to county commissioners, never shutting up.
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:24.222]  Just hammering and hammering and hammering and saying,
[01:38:24.682 --> 01:38:26.944]  I'm not going to be distracted by Obama, your puppet.
[01:38:26.984 --> 01:38:32.208]  I'm not going to be distracted by Mitt Romney when he runs, probably the next president, coming up in three years.
[01:38:32.568 --> 01:38:36.451]  I'm not going to be distracted by your left-wing, right-wing fake fight.
[01:38:36.571 --> 01:38:40.194]  Sure, there's a real fight going on there over who gets the power structure, but...
[01:38:41.054 --> 01:38:43.916]  On the issues of who's financing both sides, it doesn't matter.
[01:38:44.457 --> 01:38:46.979]  We want the Federal Reserve audited and abolished.
[01:38:47.099 --> 01:38:53.784]  We want the fiat money masters that created this fraud brought to justice, as Ron Paul and others have said on this show.
[01:38:54.065 --> 01:38:57.227]  There's plenty of evidence for criminal indictments against all of them.
[01:38:57.627 --> 01:38:59.049]  So are the police and the military.
[01:38:59.069 --> 01:39:00.430]  I know a lot of you are good men and women.
[01:39:01.090 --> 01:39:08.316]  There's no more time to sit here and suck your thumbs and support this Hitlerian system, just like German soldiers in 1940 supporting Hitler.
[01:39:09.309 --> 01:39:10.970]  We're at the cusp of this happening.
[01:39:11.530 --> 01:39:17.033]  You've got to stand up and say no and get past the peer pressure and speak out and not bow down to the power structure.
[01:39:18.294 --> 01:39:23.476]  You have got to count the costs and realize that the supposed conspiracy theorists have been right all along.
[01:39:23.556 --> 01:39:35.843]  That we have told the truth, that we have stayed the course, that those men and women out there that have been speaking out and standing up, many of them individuals being ridiculed in their towns and cities,
[01:39:37.074 --> 01:39:46.079]  Are the only hope we've got and thank God for all the people that have been there blowing the whistle because now people are listening because we warn people before all of this unfolded.
[01:39:46.099 --> 01:39:47.000]  So here's the bottom line.
[01:39:48.381 --> 01:39:49.621]  Two weeks ago, they have their G20.
[01:39:49.641 --> 01:39:51.563]  They have private breakaway groups.
[01:39:52.083 --> 01:39:54.945]  Then they start the process of testing the plunge of the dollar.
[01:39:55.345 --> 01:40:01.068]  They'll probably pop the dollar back up one more time in the next year before they fully drop it.
[01:40:01.388 --> 01:40:05.631]  But understand the media spinning this that Russia, China,
[01:40:06.701 --> 01:40:12.125]  India and others are implementing the destruction of the dollar.
[01:40:12.605 --> 01:40:18.550]  Ladies and gentlemen, the reason, the real power at the UN is not the General Assembly.
[01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:19.230]  It has no power.
[01:40:19.711 --> 01:40:22.633]  The Security Council of 15 members has all the power.
[01:40:23.393 --> 01:40:23.894]  100% of it.
[01:40:24.854 --> 01:40:30.679]  Okay, and Obama is, notice, he's the head of that right now while this critical key change is happening.
[01:40:31.059 --> 01:40:35.042]  Notice this, last week they handed the UN control of the internet.
[01:40:36.637 --> 01:40:37.597]  The systems.
[01:40:38.438 --> 01:40:42.279]  ICANN, the private corporation, was given full control and they say they'll follow UN orders.
[01:40:42.559 --> 01:40:45.520]  Notice Obama is now the head of the UN Security Council.
[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:49.561]  Notice how they're now announcing the devaluation of the dollar.
[01:40:49.601 --> 01:40:52.142]  They're just testing it with a long slide downward.
[01:40:53.443 --> 01:40:54.883]  It's all happening right now.
[01:40:54.923 --> 01:40:56.984]  We are now inside the New World Order.
[01:40:57.024 --> 01:41:03.566]  We are now witnessing the beginning phases of being inside a planetary, dehumanizing world government.
[01:41:04.435 --> 01:41:10.937]  So, A, we've got to expose the globalists, and that they're the real criminals, and that they're the shadow government, and quit being distracted by their puppets and frontmen.
[01:41:11.818 --> 01:41:14.939]  But, B, we've also got to protect ourselves.
[01:41:15.239 --> 01:41:18.140]  And, again, I'm not tooting my horn.
[01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:19.080]  It's symbiotic.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:21.141]  I believe in win-win-win-win-win.
[01:41:21.201 --> 01:41:23.382]  I believe in you reap what you sow.
[01:41:23.442 --> 01:41:24.522]  That's why I've been blessed.
[01:41:25.243 --> 01:41:28.944]  Anything I promote, anything I push, I deeply believe in.
[01:41:29.537 --> 01:41:34.263]  That's why I turned down more than half the sponsors that come to us when other people will accept anything.
[01:41:35.244 --> 01:41:36.366]  And I'm not bashing folks.
[01:41:36.426 --> 01:41:39.570]  I know we've got an important message to get out and a lot of people I'm not here judging.
[01:41:39.630 --> 01:41:41.613]  The point is, we have high moral standards.
[01:41:42.554 --> 01:41:44.737]  And that's why I wanted to come back on live today.
[01:41:45.814 --> 01:41:49.035]  And just point out that we've been right about everything, unfortunately.
[01:41:49.095 --> 01:41:49.856]  I wish I was wrong.
[01:41:50.176 --> 01:41:51.557]  But it's not tootin' my horn.
[01:41:51.797 --> 01:41:53.657]  The globalists admitted this in all their own documents.
[01:41:53.998 --> 01:42:03.242]  But we have the courage to stand up and say things that were unpopular because our children and our grandchildren mattered, and because the truth is what matters, and standing against tyranny is what matters.
[01:42:03.942 --> 01:42:09.865]  Now, I told you buying gold when it was 280 bucks, when it was 300, when it was 400, when it was 500, when it was 600, when it was 700, when it was 800, when it was 900, when it was 1,000.
[01:42:14.952 --> 01:42:17.414]  Now it's 1,060 and climbing.
[01:42:17.894 --> 01:42:19.896]  In fact, I was talking to Ted, he said it's gone up even more.
[01:42:20.376 --> 01:42:21.497]  It's getting insane.
[01:42:21.677 --> 01:42:24.960]  Now, I'm sure they'll try to drive it back down, but the new low will be 1,020.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:25.901]  And then it'll go up to 1,200.
[01:42:26.481 --> 01:42:27.122]  Then they'll drive it down to 1,100.
[01:42:27.182 --> 01:42:28.042]  Then it'll be 1,300.
[01:42:28.082 --> 01:42:28.863]  Then they'll drive it down to 1,200.
[01:42:28.903 --> 01:42:29.323]  Then it'll be 1,400.
[01:42:29.443 --> 01:42:30.264]  Then they'll drive it down to 1,300.
[01:42:30.324 --> 01:42:30.764]  Back and forth.
[01:42:30.784 --> 01:42:33.066]  But if you look at the 7-year trend, the 8-year trend, it's going straight up.
[01:42:33.086 --> 01:42:33.567]  It's more than tripled.
[01:42:44.651 --> 01:42:45.992]  It's almost quadrupled.
[01:42:46.613 --> 01:42:49.956]  If it continues in a month, it would have quadrupled in eight years.
[01:42:49.976 --> 01:42:51.838]  No other investment is doing that.
[01:42:52.378 --> 01:42:59.085]  And the reason we told you to get gold earlier was because we're not idiots, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:00.046 --> 01:43:04.510]  It's not the Russians and the Chinese and all these people that are devaluing the dollar.
[01:43:05.859 --> 01:43:14.426]  The Russians and the Chinese and the Indians have been allowed into the G15, into the UN Security Council, because they've been fully taken over by the New World Order.
[01:43:15.206 --> 01:43:17.728]  Decades ago, there was only six members, and then eight members.
[01:43:17.988 --> 01:43:24.934]  They only allow countries that are fully controlled by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and Saxe-Coburg Gothas to be in there.
[01:43:26.195 --> 01:43:26.555]  Okay?
[01:43:27.095 --> 01:43:27.576]  This is key.
[01:43:29.059 --> 01:43:44.487]  And so when you hear China and that the Arabs are doing this, no, they've been begging for five years for the West to stop issuing tens of trillions of the M3 money supply every year and devaluing their investments when their number one investment is U.S.
[01:43:44.567 --> 01:43:44.987]  dollars.
[01:43:45.447 --> 01:43:46.928]  And they've begged and they've pleaded.
[01:43:47.569 --> 01:43:50.870]  And they've been told, no, we're going to devalue the dollar incrementally.
[01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:54.072]  So they're publicly saying that they all write this in their newspapers.
[01:43:55.552 --> 01:43:59.256]  They're saying, look, your private banks are swindling you and swindling us.
[01:43:59.316 --> 01:44:04.742]  This is the New World Order, and if you're going to go ahead and destroy the U.S., we're not going down with you.
[01:44:05.322 --> 01:44:06.383]  So understand that.
[01:44:06.504 --> 01:44:08.886]  In the end, they're going to bomb the Arabs and say they did it.
[01:44:09.226 --> 01:44:10.868]  In the end, they're going to say the Chinese did it.
[01:44:10.888 --> 01:44:18.116]  They've got a new Red Dawn coming out, where the Chinese do economic warfare, and people will believe that, and the media is going to blame the Chinese.
[01:44:18.636 --> 01:44:20.197]  You want to blame the New World Order?
[01:44:20.237 --> 01:44:21.517]  You want to blame Bernanke?
[01:44:21.857 --> 01:44:23.678]  You want to blame the Rockefellers?
[01:44:23.698 --> 01:44:25.019]  You want to blame Geithner?
[01:44:25.059 --> 01:44:26.839]  You want to blame Larry Summers?
[01:44:26.919 --> 01:44:31.441]  You want to blame the people we document in the Obama Deception and Fall of the Republic?
[01:44:32.642 --> 01:44:41.365]  Our lives depend on it, because if they are able to stage events and pose as saviors again, they're going to bring us into an even greater tyranny.
[01:44:41.585 --> 01:44:43.226]  They want to lower our standard of living.
[01:44:43.246 --> 01:44:46.307]  They want to destroy our industrial society, and as bad a
[01:44:47.398 --> 01:44:52.399]  Situation we're in, as good a job they've done of wrecking our society, they haven't even gotten started yet.
[01:44:52.439 --> 01:44:59.041]  So look, in the few minutes we've got left here, before Dave Mustaine comes up, I want to bring Ted Anderson up.
[01:44:59.061 --> 01:45:01.522]  I'm going to bring him into the next segment, too, and then Dave Mustaine.
[01:45:01.542 --> 01:45:03.743]  I'm going to go ahead and go to just the end of this hour with him.
[01:45:04.303 --> 01:45:05.443]  Ted Anderson is there waiting.
[01:45:05.463 --> 01:45:09.324]  He's got a bunch of news articles and a bunch of documentation, but I want to be very clear about this.
[01:45:10.204 --> 01:45:12.345]  This is a sad day that we're right about gold.
[01:45:13.462 --> 01:45:16.404]  But Ted still has the offer from yesterday at $9.94.
[01:45:16.444 --> 01:45:19.565]  He had it at $9.90, but that sold out.
[01:45:19.626 --> 01:45:20.746]  He has $9.94.
[01:45:20.786 --> 01:45:22.747]  That's when he bought this gold and silver in the market.
[01:45:23.748 --> 01:45:39.177]  It's now skyrocketed, and this is going to run out again tonight, and Ted is here to tell us tomorrow he's still going to have another great deal, but it'll probably be about $1,000 in the market from what he's bought, because Ted's been buying as it goes down, and then he sells it cheap when the market goes up.
[01:45:39.617 --> 01:45:41.498]  Ted Anderson, what is gold doing right now?
[01:45:42.378 --> 01:45:45.420]  Well, like you said, Alex, gold has gone over $1,060.
[01:45:45.621 --> 01:45:51.185]  It's at $1,062 at its peak today, currently right now at $1,054.70.
[01:45:51.886 --> 01:45:56.729]  So we're seeing new highs that we've never seen before in gold and the market is hot.
[01:45:57.070 --> 01:46:02.814]  And like you said, I mean, I was just looking through, you know, all the different news services out there that I could find.
[01:46:03.235 --> 01:46:05.997]  Bloomberg right now is talking about gold going up.
[01:46:06.584 --> 01:46:08.852]  Dan Burrows right now is talking about gold at $2,225.
[01:46:08.912 --> 01:46:09.515]  Just CNBC saying $2,000.
[01:46:13.584 --> 01:46:14.685]  Yeah, Richard Russell.
[01:46:14.785 --> 01:46:16.486]  I'm looking at Gary North right now.
[01:46:16.567 --> 01:46:18.588]  Gary North is talking about gold going up.
[01:46:18.628 --> 01:46:27.256]  There's been a divorce between Arab oil and the United States dollar, and that's one of the few things that supported the United States dollar like it has.
[01:46:27.276 --> 01:46:32.000]  You've covered that issue how many times on your show over the last year, year and a half, two years?
[01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:38.885]  And that separation from the Arab oil and the dollar is going to be devastating to the United States dollar.
[01:46:39.446 --> 01:46:41.708]  It's like one of the last few footholds
[01:46:42.068 --> 01:46:44.430]  That foreigners have to hold on to U.S.
[01:46:44.490 --> 01:46:46.191]  American currency as reserve.
[01:46:46.731 --> 01:46:49.293]  And that stuff is going to be sold into the marketplace.
[01:46:49.633 --> 01:46:54.657]  And I wish I could tell you that again, that you're wrong about this banking thing, but you're dead on right!
[01:46:55.365 --> 01:47:04.753]  There is a national, there is a worldwide banking cartel that is really trying to take over what was value in the United States.
[01:47:05.074 --> 01:47:09.357]  We'd be standing on our own right now if we had constitutional money, but we haven't.
[01:47:09.397 --> 01:47:19.026]  We turned it over to this Federal Reserve System, and now they're turning it over to this World Banking System, and the United States is losing a war that they don't even know that they're engaged in.
[01:47:20.322 --> 01:47:21.143]  Absolutely, Ted.
[01:47:21.183 --> 01:47:38.139]  And just like these private banks write books about how they go in and buy off third world countries, pay the dictators or corrupt political legislatures to not pay the money back, they're now going into the states, putting more federal mandates on them, and then the private banks are loaning U.S.
[01:47:38.199 --> 01:47:40.681]  stimulus funds to the states.
[01:47:40.761 --> 01:47:42.203]  So they take the money from the states,
[01:47:43.146 --> 01:47:45.407]  Give it to private banks, then they loan it.
[01:47:46.067 --> 01:47:49.669]  Some states are paying as high as 20% compounding interest.
[01:47:49.889 --> 01:47:52.510]  Loan-sharking levels.
[01:47:52.570 --> 01:47:53.130]  And this is it.
[01:47:53.190 --> 01:47:59.773]  They're finally totally bankrupting us, tapping us out, while at the same time deploying troops inside the U.S.
[01:48:00.413 --> 01:48:01.734]  They plan on
[01:48:02.834 --> 01:48:04.335]  Absolutely gutting us.
[01:48:04.915 --> 01:48:08.176]  And folks, all I can say is I hope you get into gold right now.
[01:48:08.236 --> 01:48:09.977]  I hope you call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:48:11.357 --> 01:48:19.480]  That's 1-800-686-2237 because at least we grab a little bit of victory from the jaws of defeat.
[01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:21.100]  The bankers are taking over.
[01:48:21.140 --> 01:48:22.041]  They're raping everything.
[01:48:22.061 --> 01:48:23.201]  They're kidnapping our kids.
[01:48:23.241 --> 01:48:24.442]  They're poisoning the vaccines.
[01:48:24.462 --> 01:48:25.682]  They're enjoying themselves.
[01:48:25.982 --> 01:48:27.302]  They're having their world government.
[01:48:27.683 --> 01:48:28.403]  But at least
[01:48:29.344 --> 01:48:43.358]  Patriots and people that know about the New World Order have seen triple profits, and at least people can protect themselves by getting into gold and silver, and at least the listeners here can get gold factored into the market at a market that was $994 versus $1059.56.
[01:48:43.398 --> 01:48:43.818]  The point here is,
[01:48:51.169 --> 01:48:55.192]  Ted has got the sovereigns, the gold sovereigns, the gorgeous gold sovereigns.
[01:48:55.212 --> 01:48:59.435]  He's got the Franks, the Swiss, the French Franks, some other Franks.
[01:48:59.875 --> 01:49:01.576]  It's a European unit.
[01:49:02.117 --> 01:49:04.218]  He's got the silver half dollars.
[01:49:05.179 --> 01:49:06.240]  Ted, tell them about the coins.
[01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:07.060]  Tell them about the offer.
[01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:08.041]  Yeah, sure.
[01:49:08.061 --> 01:49:10.142]  I mean, the British sovereign we're carrying right now is at $291.
[01:49:11.550 --> 01:49:13.393]  The Franks currently are at $236.
[01:49:13.513 --> 01:49:17.258]  The Walking Liberty halves right now are $8.69.
[01:49:17.638 --> 01:49:24.988]  You know, the Franks, you can go in and take a look at the, go to Infowars.com.
[01:49:25.349 --> 01:49:27.732]  They haven't changed the price on the Lakota Nation coin.
[01:49:27.792 --> 01:49:28.193]  It's still at
[01:49:28.533 --> 01:49:31.215]  $22.30.
[01:49:28.593 --> 01:49:31.215]  I mean, we're almost looking at $18 silver now.
[01:49:31.235 --> 01:49:32.837]  We're looking at gold at $1,050 plus.
[01:49:32.977 --> 01:49:33.898]  Alex, that's a run.
[01:49:33.918 --> 01:49:35.599]  Gold is going to shoot through $1,060 and then $1,070.
[01:49:35.639 --> 01:49:36.740]  Let's just be clear on this.
[01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:38.622]  Let's be clear on this.
[01:49:38.642 --> 01:49:41.364]  And correct me if I'm wrong, but you told me this yesterday off-air.
[01:49:53.141 --> 01:49:57.752]  You are paying yourself wholesale, a huge wholesaler, a huge buyer.
[01:49:58.193 --> 01:50:03.685]  You are paying more for these gold and silver coins now when you're buying them than for what you're selling them to people.
[01:50:04.716 --> 01:50:17.106]  Yeah, right now we are paying less, we're paying more than what I can sell them for at this particular time, because the market has gone up that particular, you know, the market has gone up that much.
[01:50:17.206 --> 01:50:21.410]  Understand, Ted is a wholesaler, cannot get the deal he's about to offer you.
[01:50:21.470 --> 01:50:22.310]  How is he doing that?
[01:50:22.611 --> 01:50:30.637]  Because he bought it when it was low, and he's keeping the tiny markup he had from when gold was sixty-something dollars less than it is now.
[01:50:30.737 --> 01:50:32.539]  That's how he's passing this on.
[01:50:32.839 --> 01:50:34.020]  That's how you're getting this deal.
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:35.160]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:35.180 --> 01:50:37.902]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:37.922 --> 01:50:49.207]  Ted, I want to come back with one more second before Dave Mustaine on this October 8th live Thursday edition and talk about what it'll look like as the dollar dies.
[01:50:49.827 --> 01:50:52.169]  With your expertise on that and some more of the news headlines.

[01:50:52.989 --> 01:50:54.250]  It's the GCN Radio Network.
[01:50:54.290 --> 01:50:55.050]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:52:03.455 --> 01:52:05.997]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:52:06.017 --> 01:52:08.598]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:52:08.678 --> 01:52:09.818]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:52:09.858 --> 01:52:11.439]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:52:11.539 --> 01:52:14.360]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:18.061]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR.
[01:52:27.712 --> 01:52:32.623]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:52:36.386 --> 01:52:37.466]  How dare you!
[01:52:38.827 --> 01:52:43.888]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:52:43.908 --> 01:52:46.709]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:52:46.789 --> 01:52:52.970]  And if the government has not told the truth, in 5 years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:54:09.057 --> 01:54:10.579]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:10.659 --> 01:54:14.142]  It is October 8, 2009 on this Thursday edition.
[01:54:17.771 --> 01:54:20.992]  And just to be clear here, we are seeing the fall of the Republic.
[01:54:21.513 --> 01:54:27.435]  First, they had to take the greatest industrial nation, the greatest manufacturing nation, the greatest saving nation.
[01:54:29.256 --> 01:54:33.598]  And now, look, the man and woman both got to work two jobs, the average person's in deep, deep debt.
[01:54:33.638 --> 01:54:37.620]  We have the greatest debt ratio of any society in history, even greater than the Great Depression.
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:41.581]  The bankers are now making their move with the paramilitary forces on us.
[01:54:42.062 --> 01:54:43.282]  They're now locking everything down.
[01:54:43.302 --> 01:54:45.283]  They're now making announcements to spy on your neighbors.
[01:54:46.167 --> 01:54:49.053]  They're going to pay people to be spies, to be thugs.
[01:54:49.795 --> 01:54:51.358]  The whole economy is going to be prisoned.
[01:54:51.418 --> 01:54:52.901]  It's going to be really, really rough, folks.
[01:54:52.961 --> 01:54:56.268]  I just want you to know this is real tyranny we're facing.
[01:54:56.937 --> 01:54:59.860]  And if we don't bring the bankers to justice, they're not going to give us a quarter.
[01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:01.321]  They're not going to back off.
[01:55:01.341 --> 01:55:02.122]  They're not going to quit.
[01:55:02.822 --> 01:55:07.566]  The bare minimum we can do is get out of their fiat currency and their stock markets before they hammer us too bad.
[01:55:07.606 --> 01:55:08.987]  The dollar is plunging right now.
[01:55:09.588 --> 01:55:11.169]  Again, this is inexorable.
[01:55:11.430 --> 01:55:13.311]  The bankers made the decision to do this.
[01:55:13.892 --> 01:55:16.094]  They make the profits while everybody else are suckers.
[01:55:16.914 --> 01:55:18.175]  Well, now the world's getting out of it.
[01:55:18.456 --> 01:55:20.537]  Ted, what will it look like as the dollar dies?
[01:55:21.118 --> 01:55:24.521]  Incremental versus a climactic plunge.
[01:55:25.236 --> 01:55:29.039]  Well, I would say it's going to be incremental, but it already has been incremental.
[01:55:29.079 --> 01:55:31.982]  We only have about two cents of the value left in the dollar.
[01:55:32.662 --> 01:55:33.743]  You know what it's going to be like?
[01:55:33.803 --> 01:55:49.957]  It's going to be like what I've seen in Argentina, where I saw a mom and dad and a couple of kids huddled up in a blanket in a store shop door while it's freezing rain, not freezing rain, but sleeting outside, misting, and they're trying to stay warm.
[01:55:50.858 --> 01:55:53.480]  That's the kind of thing that we're looking at here in the United States.
[01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:57.222]  And they were a first world nation before the bankers did the exact same thing.
[01:55:57.262 --> 01:55:58.482]  I've been on their TV and radio.
[01:55:58.502 --> 01:55:59.383]  They all know it as well.
[01:55:59.843 --> 01:56:02.224]  They did exactly what we're doing.
[01:56:02.264 --> 01:56:04.706]  We allowed ourselves to get in way too much debt.
[01:56:05.086 --> 01:56:06.907]  We lived on economic times.
[01:56:07.047 --> 01:56:09.008]  Our prosperity was handed to us.
[01:56:09.248 --> 01:56:10.809]  And it's all made up by these bankers.
[01:56:10.849 --> 01:56:12.510]  These bankers just suckered us in.
[01:56:13.235 --> 01:56:14.315]  That's exactly right.
[01:56:14.416 --> 01:56:19.597]  We got suckered into a system that forces us to take on debt in order to have commerce.
[01:56:20.218 --> 01:56:22.679]  And that has just been compounding against us since 1913.
[01:56:22.939 --> 01:56:33.803]  And now the solution to the problem is to put us into a fiat currency system where we now have to service interest on debt to a world bank rather than our own national bank.
[01:56:35.083 --> 01:56:37.385]  Absolutely, and in closing, Ted, I wanted to add this point.
[01:56:37.405 --> 01:56:40.488]  I never got to it yesterday, but Sunday or Monday, I'm going to play the video.
[01:56:40.508 --> 01:56:41.890]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:51.519]  John Elway's put out a Homeland Security training video where he says if somebody owns gold or they have guns, call Homeland Security on them.
[01:56:51.559 --> 01:56:53.341]  They say that's a sign of terror.
[01:56:53.881 --> 01:56:57.545]  I mean, this government, they say in the Minack Report,
[01:56:58.271 --> 01:57:04.916]  If you support Ron Paul, folks, the government's rogue, it's criminal, and they're gonna have celebrities tell you tyranny's good.
[01:57:05.397 --> 01:57:07.478]  Remember, the bankers did this to you.
[01:57:07.939 --> 01:57:15.425]  I'm telling you, folks, I feel so good pushing this deal that Ted's offering and supporting him after all he's done for this network and this country.
[01:57:16.045 --> 01:57:19.187]  Ted is giving you such an incredible deal, people really ought to be thanking him.
[01:57:19.207 --> 01:57:28.934]  And you've got to tell him Alex Jones sent you the Ted Anderson Alex Jones Special, where you're going to be paying the $1,000, $50-something price per ounce of gold.
[01:57:29.314 --> 01:57:32.877]  Ted has it right now, ladies and gentlemen, at the $9.94 level.
[01:57:33.997 --> 01:57:35.098]  Give him a call, 800-686-2237.
[01:57:35.118 --> 01:57:35.178]  800-686-2237.
[01:57:35.218 --> 01:57:36.439]  Ted, how long can you hold this deal?
[01:57:36.459 --> 01:57:38.160]  I mean, this is yesterday's deal.
[01:57:45.405 --> 01:57:55.890]  Well, you know, we keep on talking about this every time we come to the end of our interview, but I'm going to hold it until midnight tonight just because I've given you my word I'm going to sell it to you at this price.
[01:57:56.251 --> 01:58:00.713]  And I know people like to pick up your show on the podcast, and they'll be listening later on.
[01:58:00.773 --> 01:58:01.413]  So call us.
[01:58:01.733 --> 01:58:04.495]  If you're calling us on October 8th, you'll get this deal.
[01:58:05.055 --> 01:58:08.197]  Gold just ran over $1,060 an ounce.
[01:58:08.637 --> 01:58:12.058]  Obviously, it's not going to hold for very long because I can't do it.
[01:58:12.839 --> 01:58:13.939]  Prices are going to go up on me.
[01:58:13.959 --> 01:58:15.020]  I have to raise my prices.
[01:58:15.060 --> 01:58:15.720]  800-686-2237.
[01:58:15.740 --> 01:58:15.780]  800-686-2237.
[01:58:17.021 --> 01:58:21.464]  You ought to be kissing Ted.
[01:58:22.744 --> 01:58:28.928]  Imagine kissing him inside your mind's eye right now, because this is a great deal.
[01:58:30.189 --> 01:58:31.650]  Check out other deals while you can.
[01:58:31.710 --> 01:58:32.930]  Most people are running out of gold.
[01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:34.411]  Dave Mustaine's coming up.
[01:58:34.451 --> 01:58:35.512]  Thank you so much, Ted.
[01:58:35.532 --> 01:58:37.813]  Even though they're taking over our country, at least you're doing something good.
[01:58:38.233 --> 01:58:39.154]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:58:43.086 --> 01:58:45.148]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.203 --> 01:58:55.184]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:55.445 --> 01:58:57.225]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:57.445 --> 01:59:05.728]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.968 --> 01:59:11.170]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:13.131]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:13.371 --> 01:59:19.693]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.893 --> 01:59:30.636]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.936 --> 01:59:31.396]  That's right!
[01:59:31.696 --> 01:59:33.998]  Clean water right from the air you breathe.
[01:59:34.258 --> 01:59:37.601]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.

[01:59:48.990 --> 01:59:50.311]  That's Okolablue.com.
[01:59:54.114 --> 01:59:56.035]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.495 --> 01:59:59.258]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.132 --> 02:00:06.752]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.433 --> 02:00:08.473]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.194 --> 02:00:10.315]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.975 --> 02:00:11.775]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.576 --> 02:00:13.536]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.897 --> 02:00:17.719]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.279 --> 02:00:22.342]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.906 --> 02:00:29.168]  We are going to continue to cover the G20.
[02:00:29.309 --> 02:00:31.170]  Open world government being announced.
[02:00:31.211 --> 02:00:33.473]  Barack Obama is the first U.S.
[02:00:33.513 --> 02:00:38.698]  President to sit as the Chairman of the United Nations Security Council.
[02:00:38.738 --> 02:00:42.141]  The 15-member, that's the only group that can really vote and has power.
[02:00:42.642 --> 02:00:44.404]  The General Assembly has no power.
[02:00:45.322 --> 02:00:50.608]  CNN called him president of the world, and he was shaking when he gaveled it in two days ago.
[02:00:51.108 --> 02:00:52.250]  Shaking with pleasure.
[02:00:53.471 --> 02:00:53.731]  U.S.
[02:00:53.771 --> 02:00:56.114]  Ambassador Rice behind him was shaking.
[02:00:57.172 --> 02:00:59.413]  Henry Kissinger was shaking in the audience.
[02:00:59.473 --> 02:01:05.396]  This is the New World Order, the Eugenics World Government, now coming into fruition.
[02:01:05.657 --> 02:01:10.619]  We are joined by Dave Mustaine, the founder and lead guitarist and lead singer of Megadeth.
[02:01:11.359 --> 02:01:14.061]  Guitarist, lead singer of Megadeth, Megadeth.com.
[02:01:14.081 --> 02:01:20.624]  The new album is in game, and I just want to say that growing up, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 today, I have always loved Megadeth because the lyrics
[02:01:26.661 --> 02:01:36.704]  I didn't even really understand him when I was 12, 14, 15 years old, 20 years old, but then as I learned about the new world order, the eugenics, the master plan, it really did influence me.
[02:01:36.744 --> 02:01:38.264]  I didn't even realize how much it did.
[02:01:38.284 --> 02:01:41.365]  A man way before his time understanding what was coming.
[02:01:41.645 --> 02:01:45.447]  Most of their covers are about the UN and world government, and now it's all happening.
[02:01:45.707 --> 02:01:46.967]  Dave Mustaine, joining us.
[02:01:47.007 --> 02:01:47.927]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:01:47.947 --> 02:01:49.048]  You're welcome, Alex.
[02:01:50.368 --> 02:01:51.788]  What do you think about what's happening?
[02:01:51.848 --> 02:01:53.369]  World government being announced.
[02:01:54.182 --> 02:01:55.784]  It's pretty frightening.
[02:01:55.844 --> 02:02:16.441]  I have to be really careful when I do my interviews and talk about a lot of stuff because you have to be objective and you have to give people the right to think out of the box but I think you and I agree on a lot of things and especially I want to tell you thanks for inspiring me to look into the whole Endgame film and
[02:02:17.208 --> 02:02:29.499]  And I actually had discovered this document through watching an inspirational video, and then, you know, I know we've spoken before, and that was a privilege for me, because I believe you're a patriot.
[02:02:30.199 --> 02:02:33.782]  And I think that our country needs more people like you.
[02:02:34.083 --> 02:02:44.031]  And as far as having our record called Endgame, you know, I think the best way to thank somebody is to, you know,
[02:02:48.170 --> 02:02:49.211]  Well, thank you Dave.
[02:02:49.251 --> 02:02:57.581]  Listen, that's just amazing that you influenced me and then now with my research I've influenced you.
[02:02:57.981 --> 02:02:59.563]  It's kind of the circle is complete.
[02:03:04.192 --> 02:03:09.617]  Well, I tell you, I mean, my wife is freaked out because she researches all this and she says, it's happening.
[02:03:10.318 --> 02:03:13.762]  It's world government, world taxes, world carbon taxes.
[02:03:14.723 --> 02:03:26.074]  We're going to go to break in a moment and some stations join us, but Dave, tell us about the new record that's already, from what I've seen in the news, exploding up the charts in-game.
[02:03:26.658 --> 02:03:32.013]  Well, the new record we have recorded in a studio that I own in San Marcos, California.
[02:03:32.033 --> 02:03:34.119]  I moved back to San Diego after
[02:03:34.767 --> 02:03:39.628]  The lawsuit with Ellison, I just didn't want to be in the same city with him, so we moved.
[02:03:39.968 --> 02:03:48.651]  And then when I started doing this record, of course, I have a real free world kind of thinking with my lyrics and stuff.
[02:03:48.671 --> 02:03:56.313]  So it was just going to be more of the same with this record, just continuing my idea to raise awareness and to help people think.
[02:03:57.153 --> 02:04:01.674]  I may not be right, but I'm certainly right to inspire people to question.
[02:04:02.926 --> 02:04:07.970]  And this record has a lot of topics, and it talks about the collapse of the financial institutions.
[02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:22.201]  You know, I went to school and I got licensed by the state and federal government to work on Wall Street as a stockbroker, and I figured, you know, being in the music business, most people in the music business aren't very smart when it comes to their money, so I wanted to be smart and educate myself about that.
[02:04:22.221 --> 02:04:24.282]  And along the way, you learn so much.
[02:04:24.322 --> 02:04:27.565]  The more that you're willing to exercise your brain, the more that
[02:04:28.214 --> 02:04:30.556]  Dave, we've got a break.
[02:04:30.616 --> 02:04:31.596]  We've got a break.
[02:04:31.656 --> 02:04:33.137]  The satellite makes us break.
[02:04:33.177 --> 02:04:33.697]  Stay right there.
[02:04:33.738 --> 02:04:37.420]  We'll be right back with Dave Mustaine, the founder of Megadeth.
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:37.860]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.970 --> 02:05:03.892]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:04.352 --> 02:05:07.513]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.974 --> 02:05:12.336]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.556 --> 02:05:18.139]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:05:18.439 --> 02:05:22.922]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:23.203 --> 02:05:26.245]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.825 --> 02:05:31.228]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.649 --> 02:05:37.953]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:38.213 --> 02:05:40.155]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.635 --> 02:05:43.457]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:43.838 --> 02:05:47.901]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[02:05:48.341 --> 02:05:50.483]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.

[02:06:01.132 --> 02:06:08.597]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:06:08.877 --> 02:06:14.661]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[02:06:14.961 --> 02:06:17.643]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:06:17.923 --> 02:06:23.827]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:06:24.187 --> 02:06:25.628]  This book will work for anyone.
[02:06:25.768 --> 02:06:28.050]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:06:28.250 --> 02:06:33.654]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:06:33.894 --> 02:06:35.735]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:06:35.976 --> 02:06:37.337]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:06:37.717 --> 02:06:39.979]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:06:40.239 --> 02:06:44.622]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:06:44.982 --> 02:06:48.365]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:06:48.685 --> 02:06:50.826]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:51.787 --> 02:06:53.228]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:53.688 --> 02:06:56.349]  One last time, it's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:07:01.451 --> 02:07:04.052]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.452 --> 02:07:09.434]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.795 --> 02:07:11.535]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.835 --> 02:07:16.657]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.838 --> 02:07:17.758]  How much do you want?
[02:07:18.018 --> 02:07:18.779]  When do you want it?
[02:07:19.139 --> 02:07:20.740]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:21.861]  When will you need it?
[02:07:22.101 --> 02:07:24.163]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:24.303 --> 02:07:25.404]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.644 --> 02:07:26.985]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:27.165 --> 02:07:32.249]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:32.449 --> 02:07:35.632]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:36.032 --> 02:07:39.495]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.835 --> 02:07:40.816]  How much will you need?
[02:07:41.056 --> 02:07:41.676]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.957 --> 02:07:42.877]  How much do you want?
[02:07:43.078 --> 02:07:43.798]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.818 --> 02:07:44.839]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:45.099 --> 02:07:47.861]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:48.141 --> 02:07:49.903]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:49.923 --> 02:07:50.843]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:08:17.704 --> 02:08:19.565]  You take a mortal man.
[02:08:24.528 --> 02:08:26.509]  And put him in control.
[02:08:26.589 --> 02:08:33.692]  Watch him become a god.
[02:08:38.075 --> 02:08:39.795]  Watch people's heads roll.
[02:08:39.956 --> 02:08:40.236]  Roll.
[02:08:56.179 --> 02:09:14.895]  I'm gonna start head-banging here in a minute.
[02:09:16.136 --> 02:09:18.578]  Dave, I listened to that song.
[02:09:19.278 --> 02:09:20.419]  What did that come out in the early 1990s?
[02:09:20.499 --> 02:09:23.582]  Yeah, that was Countdown to Extinction.
[02:09:25.559 --> 02:09:34.732]  And now you watch as the president is the head of the UN Security Council and the president and they're openly announcing world government.
[02:09:34.973 --> 02:09:37.216]  How did you know all of this 15 years ago?
[02:09:40.856 --> 02:09:41.276]  I don't know.
[02:09:41.437 --> 02:09:43.920]  Your lucky guess maybe?
[02:09:44.220 --> 02:09:55.716]  Paying attention to the news, listening to people like yourself, other people who are thinking for themselves and they're not being led off the slaughter like mindless sheep.
[02:09:57.967 --> 02:09:58.487]  Amazing.
[02:09:58.767 --> 02:09:59.948]  Some stations just joined us.
[02:09:59.968 --> 02:10:03.229]  Dave Mustaine, the founder and guitarist and lead singer of Megadeth.
[02:10:03.249 --> 02:10:04.890]  Megadeth.com is the website.
[02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:07.071]  A lot about the band, what's happening, what's going on.
[02:10:07.731 --> 02:10:08.911]  But you got interrupted by the break.
[02:10:08.971 --> 02:10:15.454]  Let's get back into what influenced your new, very popular, out of the gates, just released album, Endgame.
[02:10:15.734 --> 02:10:20.076]  And you were getting into how they try to call us conspiracy theorists, but it's all now being announced.
[02:10:21.496 --> 02:10:28.518]  It's really easy for people, whenever you talk about things that are controversial in nature, for people to sit on the sidelines and point their fingers.
[02:10:28.579 --> 02:10:43.203]  So, when anybody says anything that's controversial in nature, especially stuff that has to do with our government or any of the administration, whether they say it's anti-patriotic or they say that you're just a nutjob and to be even more insulting.
[02:10:43.843 --> 02:10:52.709]  You know, our nation was founded on people who think outside of the box, people who question authority, people who looked at things and said, you know, I don't agree with this.
[02:10:54.530 --> 02:10:55.610]  Well, it certainly was.
[02:10:55.911 --> 02:10:59.313]  The cover of Endgame, a lot of people email me saying, what is it?
[02:10:59.373 --> 02:11:00.593]  And I go, well, it's totally clear.
[02:11:00.613 --> 02:11:10.499]  It's a bunch of, and tell me if I'm wrong, like zombie slaves in concentration camp uniforms being marched off towards a pyramidal light and there's stacks of the FEMA coffins
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:15.141]  That have been deployed all over the country at depots.
[02:11:16.501 --> 02:11:21.222]  And there's a bunch of flies basically feeding on the death surrounding it.
[02:11:21.262 --> 02:11:23.183]  Is that an accurate breakdown of the cover?
[02:11:23.463 --> 02:11:25.343]  That's really, really, really close.
[02:11:25.903 --> 02:11:27.224]  Everything that you said is accurate.
[02:11:27.584 --> 02:11:31.224]  There's a little bit more symbology there that you might not have noticed.
[02:11:31.425 --> 02:11:37.646]  A lot of the biblical stuff like with the parting of the Red Sea and the people going through.
[02:11:38.246 --> 02:11:40.928]  There's also the barcode that's on their heads.
[02:11:41.208 --> 02:11:51.437]  If you look closely inside the album cover, it has a larger picture, but if you look closely on the cover, there's what appears to be a mohawk going up the back of your skyscraper.
[02:11:51.457 --> 02:11:52.337]  That's not what it is.
[02:11:52.377 --> 02:11:58.182]  When you get inside of the cover and you look at it, it's the barcode because, you know, they say nothing can be bought or sold without the mark.
[02:11:58.802 --> 02:11:59.523]  One of the biblical
[02:12:19.003 --> 02:12:19.643]  And I see it.
[02:12:19.684 --> 02:12:21.545]  They've got barcodes on the backs of their heads.
[02:12:21.885 --> 02:12:27.288]  They're in Gitmo orange jumpsuits, marching in what looks like a mass grave.
[02:12:27.968 --> 02:12:31.690]  And they're going through the Red Sea of those black FEMA coffins.
[02:12:32.050 --> 02:12:34.672]  Those are the walls of the Black Sea being held back.
[02:12:37.725 --> 02:12:50.723]  Well there you have it from Dave Mustaine and am I right to say that it kind of nexuses at a paramount point like the eye of Lucifer or the eye of Satan that is energizing this scene?
[02:12:52.469 --> 02:12:53.310]  Wow, that's pretty heavy.
[02:12:54.630 --> 02:12:59.113]  No, we didn't... I didn't go that deep with that particular part of it.
[02:12:59.133 --> 02:13:11.799]  There is a light that they're heading to at the end, but it was more kind of like a... I don't know if the Eye of Oris or whatever, you know, that kind of whole Stargate kind of thing where you're... Stay away from the light!
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:12.680]  You know what I mean?
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:21.785]  It was just something that they were walking to, and it was just something that we, in blind faith, are walking to, and we don't even realize what we're walking through.
[02:13:24.048 --> 02:13:24.729]  Absolutely.
[02:13:24.869 --> 02:13:26.271]  Wow, what a heavy cover.
[02:13:26.411 --> 02:13:37.646]  And I've seen, you know, doing some research for this interview, and also checking the album out, all these people speculating what it is, and I looked at it immediately and said, yeah, those are people marching to their death.
[02:13:40.549 --> 02:13:41.070]  Amazing.
[02:13:41.910 --> 02:13:45.174]  Tell us about some of the songs in the album.
[02:13:45.574 --> 02:13:45.835]  Okay.
[02:13:46.195 --> 02:13:49.598]  The album starts off with a classic guitar duel.
[02:13:50.399 --> 02:13:55.144]  I think a lot of your listeners will really dig the lyrics on this record, but there's also a lot of great guitar work.
[02:13:55.184 --> 02:13:57.707]  Guitar players have become very specified because
[02:13:58.513 --> 02:13:58.834]  I don't know.
[02:14:15.815 --> 02:14:24.859]  And we start off with an instrumental that's just, you know, lobbying guitar solos back and forth to each other, or volleying them back and forth with me and our other guitar player.
[02:14:24.879 --> 02:14:35.925]  And the next song is called This Day We Fight, which is influenced by the war speech that Aragon gave in, or whatever his name was, in Lord of the Rings.
[02:14:36.545 --> 02:14:43.548]  You know, saying that, hey man, we may die tomorrow, but we're not going to die today, because this day we're going to fight, and we're going to kick butt, and we're going to take down names.
[02:14:43.608 --> 02:14:44.669]  And that's how it's been for us.
[02:14:44.909 --> 02:14:48.951]  You know, we've really had to fight an uphill battle, but it really seems like the worm's turned.
[02:14:49.251 --> 02:15:00.616]  Websites like Blabbermouth that have hated me since the day that they started gave us some 8.5 on our new record, and they said that it's time for them to pay attention to Professor Dave, and I'm thinking,
[02:15:01.356 --> 02:15:01.616]  What?
[02:15:02.396 --> 02:15:09.158]  You know, this is a website that whenever I would say anything, they would post a story about it and slam me.
[02:15:09.558 --> 02:15:19.761]  So, it's amazing the way that everything is turned around right now for us, for me, for just sticking to my guns, too, because there was a period where a lot of heavy metal bands reinvented themselves.
[02:15:19.821 --> 02:15:26.643]  So, then we go into different songs, like 1320 is a song about drag racing, and the National Hot Rod Association loves the song.
[02:15:27.183 --> 02:15:32.785]  We've got a song called 44 Minutes, which is about the North Hollywood bank robbery that happened back in the 90s.
[02:15:33.505 --> 02:15:41.788]  And then, of course, the title track, which is about the document that I discovered that our former president had signed.
[02:15:42.608 --> 02:15:52.632]  It was brought to my attention by searching the web, knowing who you are, and also seeing the part that you posted about Lou Dobbs, because I really respect that guy.
[02:15:53.346 --> 02:15:56.449]  And I thought, you know, there's just something really wrong about this.
[02:15:56.489 --> 02:15:58.110]  And I looked into it and I thought, that's it.
[02:15:58.531 --> 02:16:01.453]  I'm going to sing a song about this because it's perfect.
[02:16:01.473 --> 02:16:03.395]  It completely predicts.
[02:16:03.435 --> 02:16:05.216]  Because I read 1984 when I was just a kid.
[02:16:05.397 --> 02:16:09.160]  And I've got so many songs about this, like Book of Bouncers about that.
[02:16:09.180 --> 02:16:15.065]  There was a whole bunch of stuff that talks about this future world that we're just blindly marching into.
[02:16:17.293 --> 02:16:19.474]  Well, we certainly are blindly marching in.
[02:16:19.694 --> 02:16:30.581]  We have video and photos of neighborhoods with no one even protesting, with the Pittsburgh police in Pennsylvania saying for the G20, no one's allowed to congregate, no one's allowed to be on the street.
[02:16:30.621 --> 02:16:31.601]  They say, flee!
[02:16:32.022 --> 02:16:32.222]  Flee!
[02:16:32.322 --> 02:16:34.243]  And then they turn on the sound cannons.
[02:16:34.803 --> 02:16:36.084]  They hit my employees with it.
[02:16:36.344 --> 02:16:40.006]  We've got video of them walking up to women and billy clubbing them in the head.
[02:16:40.787 --> 02:16:41.247]  Video
[02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:42.470]  Pardon me?
[02:16:43.031 --> 02:16:44.091]  I said, oh my god.
[02:16:44.611 --> 02:16:45.412]  Oh no, it's incredible.
[02:16:45.612 --> 02:16:58.359]  We've got video, and we'll play some of it in the background for people watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, nice on the radio, of the military pulling up and grabbing peaceful protesters, snatching and grabbing, cramming them into unmarked police cars.
[02:16:58.399 --> 02:16:59.219]  The military!
[02:16:59.780 --> 02:17:11.426]  I mean, so they're not only announcing the world government and the world tax, and Obama is now a dual president in the UN and the US as the chairman of the Security Council, but now the military's
[02:17:12.026 --> 02:17:15.689]  I mean, it's like they want us to know that they're in control.
[02:17:16.889 --> 02:17:17.990]  Yeah, I think so, huh?
[02:17:20.392 --> 02:17:20.612]  Wow.
[02:17:21.812 --> 02:17:22.493]  That's so sad.
[02:17:23.914 --> 02:17:26.275]  I guess you take a mortal man, you put him in control.
[02:17:26.375 --> 02:17:27.856]  Watch him become a god.
[02:17:27.876 --> 02:17:28.977]  That's right.
[02:17:30.098 --> 02:17:32.599]  And these things, you know, I've been talking about them forever.
[02:17:33.300 --> 02:17:36.102]  As long as I can write music, I've been talking about stuff like this.
[02:17:36.222 --> 02:17:38.023]  It didn't really get to a point where people would
[02:17:38.777 --> 02:17:40.978]  You know, really take anything that I said seriously.
[02:17:41.359 --> 02:17:45.281]  I mean, imagine what it's like for these poor guys that sing songs about dragons.
[02:17:47.262 --> 02:17:47.922]  Well, exactly.
[02:17:47.962 --> 02:17:55.107]  But I mean, again, I've gone over the years and read your lyrics again, and it just rung true when I was 20 years ago.
[02:17:55.127 --> 02:17:58.268]  I mean, I've been listening to Megadeth since it started when I was about 12.
[02:17:59.734 --> 02:18:28.124]  and uh... when you started it uh... and and i was like i don't know it was always probably my favorite if not my favorite uh... you know heavy metal they like to speed mail and everything in the mix in the different and i like the fact that you're not fake you've never changed i mean expanded and and grown but but it's never change you're not changing your hairstyle or acting silly or or trying to get out this is yet i mean you're doing what you want to do being authentic and i think that really
[02:18:29.165 --> 02:18:38.313]  Well, I think that's a very American way, too, you know, just to be true to yourself and stand up for what you believe in.
[02:18:38.333 --> 02:18:46.720]  You know, it's hard for people to really stand up for what they believe in anymore because, you know, if you do something like that, they'll vilify you.
[02:18:47.541 --> 02:18:50.223]  If you're doing anything that isn't status quo,
[02:18:50.834 --> 02:19:00.484]  Yeah, it was hard in the very beginning to be open about my life, the problems I had, and to be open about the band and the problems we had.
[02:19:01.605 --> 02:19:09.013]  People were not responding to that very well, but now at this point I can always say that I've been sincere since the beginning.
[02:19:09.413 --> 02:19:13.898]  You see these other guys that do these image makeovers and go from one band where they're dressed like
[02:19:14.418 --> 02:19:17.040]  Well, again, you have been anti-New World Order, anti-global government,
[02:19:44.244 --> 02:19:45.746]  How long has Megadeth been around?
[02:19:45.766 --> 02:19:46.047]  21 years?
[02:19:46.107 --> 02:19:46.407]  Longer?
[02:19:46.427 --> 02:19:50.392]  Yeah, it's been close to 25 years.
[02:19:50.432 --> 02:19:56.040]  When we started, it took a little time until we got the first lineup and went into the studio to record.
[02:19:56.060 --> 02:19:56.421]  That happened.
[02:19:56.461 --> 02:19:57.081]  Stay there, Dave.
[02:19:57.101 --> 02:19:57.702]  Gotta break again.
[02:19:57.742 --> 02:19:58.463]  Sorry to cut you off.
[02:19:58.583 --> 02:19:59.224]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:59.264 --> 02:19:59.625]  Amazing.
[02:19:59.645 --> 02:20:00.246]  Dave Mustaine.
[02:20:01.414 --> 02:20:05.637]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[02:20:05.917 --> 02:20:09.940]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:20.647]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[02:20:21.027 --> 02:20:22.688]  These key ingredients not only supply
[02:20:26.459 --> 02:20:26.819]  I think so.
[02:20:42.910 --> 02:20:43.750]  We're good to go.
[02:21:01.894 --> 02:21:02.735]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:21:02.935 --> 02:21:08.262]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:21:08.462 --> 02:21:08.883]  I get it.
[02:21:09.003 --> 02:21:18.335]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:21:18.635 --> 02:21:19.797]  That's not what's happening.
[02:21:20.037 --> 02:21:28.281]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:21:28.501 --> 02:21:31.783]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:21:31.903 --> 02:21:35.985]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:21:36.165 --> 02:21:37.725]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:21:37.765 --> 02:21:41.007]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:21:41.167 --> 02:21:45.329]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:21:45.529 --> 02:21:46.229]  You should too.
[02:21:46.429 --> 02:21:47.409]  Find out what they know.
[02:21:47.569 --> 02:21:50.930]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:21:50.950 --> 02:21:51.170]  800-686-2237.
[02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:51.230]  800-686-2237.
[02:21:51.290 --> 02:21:51.470]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:21:51.490 --> 02:21:52.211]  It is a big idea.
[02:21:52.231 --> 02:21:52.911]  A new world order.
[02:21:52.931 --> 02:21:53.471]  In the near future.
[02:22:07.708 --> 02:22:10.331]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:22:10.792 --> 02:22:12.554]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:22:13.615 --> 02:22:15.878]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[02:22:16.398 --> 02:22:18.841]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:22:19.602 --> 02:22:26.891]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:22:29.926 --> 02:22:34.909]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:22:35.390 --> 02:22:38.872]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:22:39.252 --> 02:22:41.734]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:22:41.814 --> 02:22:42.955]  Most people have no idea.
[02:22:42.975 --> 02:22:43.735]  They're not after money.
[02:22:43.755 --> 02:22:44.836]  They have all the money they need.
[02:22:45.056 --> 02:22:45.636]  They're after power.
[02:22:45.657 --> 02:22:46.897]  That's what they're after these years.

[02:23:05.788 --> 02:23:07.028]  It's a scary world we live in.
[02:23:07.288 --> 02:23:11.390]  Schools closed, businesses shut down, and reports of death all from the swine flu.
[02:23:11.670 --> 02:23:14.931]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.
[02:23:15.351 --> 02:23:22.713]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper due to the nation's 12 trillion dollar debt, which is why gold is now over a thousand dollars an ounce.
[02:23:23.153 --> 02:23:25.674]  According to the Atlanta Fed Chief, unemployment is actually 16%.
[02:23:25.714 --> 02:23:26.355]  And the solution for
[02:23:27.955 --> 02:23:31.919]  Every one of these threats to your family is food security from eFoodsDirect.

[02:24:06.667 --> 02:24:10.230]  I woke up in a black beamer box
[02:24:32.978 --> 02:24:58.299]  Darkness was all around me My dreams are all nightmares anymore And this is what I dream every night The leader of the New World Order The President of the United States Has declared anyone now residing
[02:24:59.611 --> 02:25:00.311]  Yeah!
[02:25:28.342 --> 02:25:28.902]  Wake up, people!
[02:25:28.982 --> 02:25:29.302]  This is me.
[02:25:29.322 --> 02:25:31.343]  Our society, in our society.
[02:25:31.363 --> 02:25:39.126]  We're inside the fence like as you know it's not.
[02:25:39.166 --> 02:25:45.888]  They got their rules of conduct and we got ours.
[02:25:46.348 --> 02:25:50.790]  Things will begin to crumble up and die.
[02:25:50.890 --> 02:25:53.590]  The clock is ticking so slowly.
[02:25:54.111 --> 02:25:54.971]  There's so much happening.
[02:25:56.861 --> 02:25:57.541]  Unbelievable.
[02:25:58.322 --> 02:25:58.882]  Unbelievable.
[02:25:58.922 --> 02:26:02.824]  Hear the whole song, the whole album, at Megadeth.com.
[02:26:03.085 --> 02:26:06.246]  M-E-G-A-D-E-T-H dot com.
[02:26:06.747 --> 02:26:13.771]  Or just Google Megadeth, the term endgame, get it at iTunes, get the CD, get it all at Megadeth.com.
[02:26:13.791 --> 02:26:15.872]  We need to support this type of message.
[02:26:15.932 --> 02:26:19.794]  Megadeth is up there at the very top of heavy metal, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:26:20.544 --> 02:26:22.806]  And these folks have packed stadiums across the planet.
[02:26:23.147 --> 02:26:27.551]  We need this anti-New World Order message now more than ever to warn people.
[02:26:27.751 --> 02:26:32.396]  Whatever is going to happen with the New World Order, whatever this global system is going to do, we have to stand and resist it.
[02:26:32.616 --> 02:26:37.721]  And the clergy response teams have been hired by the feds to tell their flocks to not stand up and not resist.
[02:26:37.741 --> 02:26:38.842]  They're going to be raptured out.
[02:26:39.363 --> 02:26:40.184]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:26:41.233 --> 02:26:42.494]  That is unbelievable.
[02:26:42.615 --> 02:26:48.920]  Dave Mustaine, I tell you, every time I hear that song since it came out last week, it just blows me away and the lyrics just get even more hard-hitting.
[02:26:49.121 --> 02:26:59.630]  The RFID, the New World Order, the President, and then we played in the first hour audio of armored vehicles with sound cannons saying almost the same thing you've got in that intro.
[02:26:59.951 --> 02:27:01.792]  I mean, talk about unbelievable!
[02:27:04.375 --> 02:27:05.636]  Well, I'm a real American.
[02:27:06.829 --> 02:27:19.756]  Hell yeah you are, and let me tell you, tens of millions of Megadeth fans worldwide are now going to finally understand, they're always, why does he have the UN on the cover of his... I mean, you say my film Endgame influenced your album Endgame.
[02:27:20.236 --> 02:27:26.919]  This cover that I designed, I told the graphics person what to make, was influenced by a Megadeth cover.
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:33.403]  Did you notice that when you saw the Endgame DVD cover, that it was similar to that one where you have the UN and the flagless flagpoles?
[02:27:34.103 --> 02:27:34.584]  You know what?
[02:27:34.944 --> 02:27:36.345]  I know exactly what you're talking about.
[02:27:36.385 --> 02:27:37.647]  I never saw the correlation.
[02:27:37.667 --> 02:27:38.367]  That's amazing.
[02:27:39.228 --> 02:27:42.511]  But it's just crazy that you influence me and I'm influencing you.
[02:27:42.531 --> 02:27:48.337]  Well, that's what I believe good ideas when people share stuff like that.
[02:27:48.357 --> 02:27:57.105]  It's a grassroots kind of thing and people they benefit from it in a huge way when they share the truth.
[02:27:57.586 --> 02:27:58.907]  Because the truth is undeniable.
[02:28:00.419 --> 02:28:02.101]  In fact, that was from Peace Sells.
[02:28:02.201 --> 02:28:04.323]  Peace Sells, but who's buying?
[02:28:04.943 --> 02:28:05.824]  That's awesome!
[02:28:08.066 --> 02:28:10.208]  That was actually something that I saw.
[02:28:10.288 --> 02:28:14.953]  I got that song title from a Reader's Digest magazine.
[02:28:15.694 --> 02:28:21.399]  I was living with this girl, and she went to work, and I was a lazy musician, so I stayed back at her place.
[02:28:23.626 --> 02:28:24.947]  There was the Reader's Digest there.
[02:28:25.127 --> 02:28:30.331]  That's why I make fun of the magazine and the song Sweating Bullets, why I say, nice story, tell it to Reader's Digest.
[02:28:30.811 --> 02:28:37.636]  Well, yeah, because I actually read that magazine for a little while after I got the lyric, I mean the title for a few cells out of it.
[02:28:39.137 --> 02:28:43.320]  Interesting little book, but not something that's really modern anymore, I guess.
[02:28:43.540 --> 02:28:46.182]  What did you think of my film, Endgame itself, specifically?
[02:28:46.262 --> 02:28:46.683]  I loved it.
[02:28:46.843 --> 02:28:47.643]  I thought it was great.
[02:28:47.884 --> 02:28:51.266]  I mean, you're very brave to go and get in the face of people like this.
[02:28:51.346 --> 02:28:52.687]  I guess we all have our calling.
[02:28:53.772 --> 02:28:56.013]  Dave, we're about to break a minute-long segment coming up.
[02:28:56.053 --> 02:28:59.255]  In fact, we'll probably pull up P-Cells and play some of that, but some of the new album as well.
[02:28:59.555 --> 02:29:05.879]  How do folks, what's the best way, where's the best place to get your new album in-game and to support what you're doing?
[02:29:06.419 --> 02:29:10.321]  Well, I would say through Amazon or through iTunes.
[02:29:10.782 --> 02:29:15.284]  You know, you can listen to the music in many, many places right now.
[02:29:15.324 --> 02:29:18.066]  MySpace and iTunes really support it as AOLmusic.com.
[02:29:19.205 --> 02:29:19.426]  I don't
[02:29:32.262 --> 02:29:33.843]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:33.863 --> 02:29:34.904]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.220 --> 02:30:05.204]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:30:05.464 --> 02:30:07.246]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:07.466 --> 02:30:15.754]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:15.995 --> 02:30:21.220]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:21.560 --> 02:30:23.182]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:23.402 --> 02:30:29.724]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:30:29.904 --> 02:30:40.666]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:30:40.966 --> 02:30:44.047]  That's right, clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:30:44.307 --> 02:30:45.888]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:30:48.469 --> 02:31:06.302]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:06.422 --> 02:31:08.383]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:31:08.503 --> 02:31:10.785]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.945 --> 02:31:12.807]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:13.227 --> 02:31:14.568]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.848 --> 02:31:15.889]  There is a solution.
[02:31:16.109 --> 02:31:24.131]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:31:38.035 --> 02:31:43.616]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[02:32:03.941 --> 02:32:06.623]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[02:32:07.203 --> 02:32:10.785]  I repeat, do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[02:32:11.626 --> 02:32:20.531]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 16 books and a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations this flu season.
[02:32:20.851 --> 02:32:22.733]  Rely instead on OxySilver.
[02:32:23.073 --> 02:32:28.516]  OxySilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[02:32:28.776 --> 02:32:31.398]  OxySilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol.
[02:32:31.838 --> 02:32:33.559]  Far safer than colloidal silvers.
[02:32:34.199 --> 02:32:38.922]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[02:32:38.942 --> 02:32:42.003]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[02:32:42.304 --> 02:32:47.326]  Learn more about amazing OxySilver and order it online at OxySilver.com.

[02:33:22.597 --> 02:33:24.359]  Dialectic Chaos, Megadeth!
[02:33:32.526 --> 02:33:46.538]  Gotta control myself not to do air guitar.
[02:33:48.079 --> 02:33:48.440]  Franken-up!
[02:34:06.903 --> 02:34:07.123]  Yeah.
[02:34:54.631 --> 02:34:56.753]  So that's Dialectic Chaos from Endgame.
[02:34:59.415 --> 02:35:03.719]  That sounds like old school but with a somewhat of a new edge to it.
[02:35:03.759 --> 02:35:06.522]  That sounds like old school heavy metal, speed metal almost.
[02:35:06.882 --> 02:35:08.724]  Yeah, well that's what we're trying to do.
[02:35:08.744 --> 02:35:13.007]  We're trying to stick with our roots and do what we know is what we do best.
[02:35:13.087 --> 02:35:15.670]  There was a period during the beginning of the millennium
[02:35:16.190 --> 02:35:29.932]  Where bands were really forced to go and change themselves, not only change their image, change the way they look and stuff like that, but also change the way that they make their living, their music.
[02:35:31.993 --> 02:35:34.193]  Everybody needed to be like Nirvana.
[02:35:35.793 --> 02:35:39.034]  I'm sorry, that was not my cup of tea.
[02:35:39.094 --> 02:35:44.535]  We struggled through a lot of stuff and right now it's probably the most liberated that we've been with our careers and our music.
[02:35:45.251 --> 02:35:47.812]  So keeping it pure, you've got a new book coming out.
[02:35:47.872 --> 02:35:48.612]  Tell us about that.
[02:35:48.632 --> 02:35:53.554]  Right, it's called Hello Me, Meet the Real Me, which is a lyric from Sweating Bullets.
[02:35:53.855 --> 02:35:55.495]  It had to be called that, you know that?
[02:35:56.136 --> 02:35:59.137]  And it's basically me, the person.
[02:35:59.217 --> 02:36:01.258]  It's not just me, a musician.
[02:36:01.298 --> 02:36:06.600]  Because, you know, they've written everything that can be written about me as a musician from their point of view.
[02:36:07.681 --> 02:36:13.966]  Some of it's true, some of it's not, some of it's folklore, some of it makes me a lot cooler than I really am, so I just let them continue to think that way.
[02:36:14.547 --> 02:36:30.620]  But with the book itself, when I got to the last page and I closed the book, I looked up, I actually was so satiated, I was so content, that they finally have got my life into a book so far.
[02:36:32.762 --> 02:36:34.704]  I read it and I went, you know what, I get it.
[02:36:35.345 --> 02:36:35.846]  This is it.
[02:36:35.866 --> 02:36:36.867]  This is it.
[02:36:36.887 --> 02:36:38.269]  This is who I am.
[02:36:38.289 --> 02:36:39.811]  I explained everything perfectly.
[02:36:41.258 --> 02:36:46.940]  And the best part about it, I think, at the end of every chapter, it's like, God, you know, he did a lot of really rotten things.
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:53.562]  But at the end of every chapter, it tells how, you know, all those things have been made amends for, if it's possible.
[02:36:53.622 --> 02:36:59.424]  And the people that we had all these hardships with, we've gone back and worked on things.
[02:36:59.504 --> 02:37:02.785]  Some people were in the band that I'm friends with still.
[02:37:02.865 --> 02:37:05.406]  Some people were in the band in the past, and I'm not friends with them.
[02:37:08.168 --> 02:37:10.831]  Well, I tell you, I'm excited to read the new book when it comes out.
[02:37:10.911 --> 02:37:13.254]  Tell us about your new radio show you're launching.
[02:37:13.274 --> 02:37:15.376]  You're really going wild here.
[02:37:15.937 --> 02:37:26.168]  Well, you know, I mean, you've got a great platform here for you to be able to share your heart with the American people and to educate them, which is, I think, one of the highest
[02:37:27.348 --> 02:37:28.189]  I'm going to
[02:37:47.979 --> 02:37:48.820]  I love it.
[02:37:50.181 --> 02:37:52.263]  That's one of the things I really enjoy doing.
[02:37:52.804 --> 02:38:00.651]  Much in the way that the whole music industry has eaten itself and changed with the whole digital download thing now, you've got to be really clever.
[02:38:00.671 --> 02:38:06.617]  I really try my very best right now to participate with our fans as much as possible and listen
[02:38:07.738 --> 02:38:09.419]  What they're talking about, what affects them.
[02:38:09.439 --> 02:38:14.882]  You know, it's hard for me to really know what it's like to have food stamps now, but you know what?
[02:38:14.902 --> 02:38:15.203]  I did.
[02:38:15.223 --> 02:38:19.645]  I lived in a car when I was a teenager, and I was homeless.
[02:38:19.705 --> 02:38:29.871]  My mom was a maid, so I know all of these things that you have to go through to get by in life, and I think that's one of the things that most rock stars, they try and forget.
[02:38:31.616 --> 02:38:32.156]  Well, I agree.
[02:38:32.196 --> 02:38:34.438]  I see people's arrogance and their haughtiness.
[02:38:35.299 --> 02:38:38.901]  And I've been arrogant in my life at certain points, but I kind of flash back and forth.
[02:38:39.302 --> 02:38:46.907]  But I realize you get so much more strength and discernment when you are humble and realize how transitory this life is.
[02:38:47.648 --> 02:38:47.888]  Right.
[02:38:47.988 --> 02:38:55.634]  And you know, the best thing about it at the end of the day is you feel good about yourself when you've done something cool for somebody else, even if it's just enlightening them and educating them.
[02:38:56.539 --> 02:39:00.862]  You know, right now my son's almost 18, so we're going through a lot of life lessons right now.
[02:39:01.123 --> 02:39:09.409]  And yeah, he's making a lot of really costly mistakes, but nothing is... He hasn't been dismembered or disfigured yet, so everything's okay.
[02:39:09.669 --> 02:39:15.314]  But, you know, I see this and I'm thinking, like, God, I want to interrupt, and I want to rescue him, and I want to, I want to, I want to.
[02:39:15.654 --> 02:39:22.539]  But that's why most of the kids in America right now are having so many problems, because all this false praise these kids are getting.
[02:39:22.799 --> 02:39:23.120]  You know what?
[02:39:23.340 --> 02:39:24.601]  Lil' Johnny ain't perfect.
[02:39:25.698 --> 02:39:30.600]  Well, the establishment, the controllers know that.
[02:39:30.860 --> 02:39:32.160]  They tell us we've got to be perfect.
[02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:33.921]  Madison Avenue tells us we've got to be perfect.
[02:39:34.201 --> 02:39:35.441]  So we all feel inadequate.
[02:39:35.681 --> 02:39:39.722]  So we've got to buy this death culture the New World Order is selling.
[02:39:40.042 --> 02:39:41.643]  And so, oh yeah, your kid got in a fight.
[02:39:41.703 --> 02:39:44.184]  Oh, your kid's depressed because they're going into puberty.
[02:39:44.564 --> 02:39:47.885]  Oh, they need a bunch of mind-altering government-issued drugs.
[02:39:48.165 --> 02:39:48.805]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:39:51.071 --> 02:39:54.012]  Or isolate him, or single him out in front of everybody.
[02:39:54.392 --> 02:39:55.832]  Or give him electroshock therapy.
[02:39:56.392 --> 02:40:05.535]  Now, you were telling me during the break, I don't know if you want to say this on air, but you're going on tour, and you were telling me there's some disinfo going on out there about the tour.
[02:40:07.415 --> 02:40:08.276]  About the tour?
[02:40:08.396 --> 02:40:08.876]  Which part?
[02:40:09.676 --> 02:40:11.236]  Oh, the Big Four thing.
[02:40:11.276 --> 02:40:13.597]  Yeah, there's rumors going around.
[02:40:13.937 --> 02:40:16.598]  In the beginning of heavy metal in the United States, there were
[02:40:18.297 --> 02:40:18.798]  Well, I think so.
[02:40:26.209 --> 02:40:36.817]  You know, it's funny, whenever I have a new record coming out or anything like that, there's always something like this that perks up to kind of distract the interviews away from my interviews to something other than that.
[02:40:36.877 --> 02:40:39.398]  So this is nothing more than a rumor.
[02:40:39.659 --> 02:40:42.861]  People are saying that the four bands are going to get together and tour.
[02:40:43.221 --> 02:40:46.463]  We haven't heard anything about this other than just rumor and conjecture.
[02:40:46.603 --> 02:40:49.786]  So we are out with Slayer, which is fantastic.
[02:40:49.966 --> 02:40:55.730]  And, you know, we're trying really, really hard right now to mend broken fences and
[02:40:56.500 --> 02:41:01.681]  And just, you know, do the right thing with these guys because the fans love Megadeth and Slayer.
[02:41:02.301 --> 02:41:06.062]  The idea of us playing together, they're losing their minds.
[02:41:06.102 --> 02:41:13.123]  We went to Canada, it was just an over-the-top medal euphoria for these kids.
[02:41:13.143 --> 02:41:22.485]  We're going down to Australia, I'm leaving on the 2nd down there to New Zealand, Australia, then Japan, then we're coming back, we're going to Canada, and God willing, you know, we'll be bringing this package into the States someday.
[02:41:23.829 --> 02:41:27.590]  And people can find out the tour dates around the globe at Megadeth.com.
[02:41:27.630 --> 02:41:29.231]  Death with an E, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:29.551 --> 02:41:30.591]  Megadeth.com.
[02:41:30.631 --> 02:41:34.612]  Dave Mustaine joins us, ladies and gentlemen, and we're very honored to have him.
[02:41:35.473 --> 02:41:45.796]  Dave, getting back into the whole global system, the whole New World Order, in a nutshell, if you feel like it, give us your worldview on the power structure.
[02:41:46.356 --> 02:41:52.598]  You seem to be doing a lot of research on it, and where you believe the planet is going, and what the endgame really is.
[02:41:54.082 --> 02:41:57.224]  That's a heavy question there to do all that.
[02:41:57.524 --> 02:41:58.325]  I'll try my best.
[02:41:59.285 --> 02:42:01.547]  Okay, I was brought up as a little kid.
[02:42:01.587 --> 02:42:05.229]  I got baptized at four as a Lutheran and then I was brought up as a Jehovah's Witness.
[02:42:05.870 --> 02:42:20.199]  Then I revolted and got into witchcraft and black magic and then spent subsequent almost a dozen years or the following 12 years or so trying to
[02:42:21.676 --> 02:42:25.919]  Get rid of the demonic oppression I got by putting hexes on people.
[02:42:26.619 --> 02:42:27.740]  And then I became a Christian.
[02:42:27.780 --> 02:42:31.583]  So, I mean, I've been brought up around so much different religiosity.
[02:42:31.623 --> 02:42:33.204]  I'm kind of like civil, you know what I mean?
[02:42:33.884 --> 02:42:44.471]  And when it comes down to me thinking about how things are going towards the end, I have a very distorted view of it because I've been just
[02:42:45.478 --> 02:42:47.239]  Brainwashed by the Jehovah's Witnesses.
[02:42:47.820 --> 02:42:52.723]  So, you know, when Christmas time comes around, I'm thinking, well, geez, what's the tree?
[02:42:52.763 --> 02:42:53.624]  What's all this crap?
[02:42:53.664 --> 02:43:01.349]  So, um, anyways, when it comes down to what my understanding is, is that there's going to be a final war at the end and the whole way that the Antichrist plays out.
[02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:04.131]  This may alienate some of your listeners and stuff.
[02:43:04.171 --> 02:43:06.473]  I don't mean to make anybody feel bad or alienated.
[02:43:06.493 --> 02:43:07.454]  You're allowed to have your view.
[02:43:07.634 --> 02:43:07.974]  Tell us.
[02:43:08.274 --> 02:43:09.955]  Right, right.
[02:43:10.856 --> 02:43:21.684]  The problem is that I've just been cautious about this, Alex, because there's so many people that say they're Christian and they come off telling people that they're not doing stuff right, and I don't want to do that because I'm a different kind of person.
[02:43:21.704 --> 02:43:22.744]  But we want to know your view.
[02:43:22.805 --> 02:43:23.505]  You're not preaching.
[02:43:23.525 --> 02:43:23.865]  Tell us.
[02:43:23.965 --> 02:43:24.646]  Right, okay, good.
[02:43:24.686 --> 02:43:27.108]  I just need to say that because I just don't want to miss out.
[02:43:27.168 --> 02:43:28.609]  No, it's an important preface.
[02:43:28.629 --> 02:43:31.711]  So, what I think right now, I'm watching
[02:43:32.495 --> 02:43:44.109]  The President, what you just said about him becoming the President of the UN, and I'm watching all these other things happen, like to say that one of the prophecies that came true in the Bible came from when Israel became a country again.
[02:43:44.630 --> 02:43:47.934]  And that was the prophecy, it was said that Israel would become a nation again.
[02:43:47.954 --> 02:43:49.996]  Well, it's a nation again, that happened back in the 60s.
[02:43:51.098 --> 02:43:51.958]  But it happened.
[02:43:52.058 --> 02:43:56.519]  So, you know, my belief is that there's going to be a new world order.
[02:43:56.559 --> 02:43:59.160]  There's going to be one guy that's going to run the world.
[02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:01.840]  There's going to be one currency that's around everywhere.
[02:44:01.860 --> 02:44:04.321]  They're going to try and get you to take the RFID chip.
[02:44:04.681 --> 02:44:07.241]  That's the mark of the beast that they're going to use to buy and sell things.
[02:44:07.321 --> 02:44:14.683]  And like you had brought up so brilliantly in your movie about Rockefeller, saying that if they don't like you, they're just going to turn your chip off.
[02:44:16.377 --> 02:44:17.018]  Absolutely.
[02:44:17.358 --> 02:44:31.833]  So I mean all of this stuff is mind-boggling because you don't really hear about all the technology and stuff like that in the Bible, but the Bible is the basic text that I try to live my life by and I still have a dirty mouth and I still look at women and have kind of terrible thoughts sometimes.
[02:44:32.714 --> 02:44:33.955]  Hey, you're not a Pharisee!
[02:44:33.975 --> 02:44:35.877]  I mean, look who Jesus hung out with.
[02:44:35.897 --> 02:44:39.461]  He didn't hang out with the Pharisees saying how great they were.
[02:44:39.481 --> 02:44:42.464]  He hung out with people who were trying to have a pure heart.
[02:44:42.724 --> 02:44:43.565]  I mean, look at David.
[02:44:43.605 --> 02:44:50.693]  Look at David, you know, had people killed so he could have their women, but he repented, and so God said, that is a man after my own heart.
[02:44:51.073 --> 02:44:51.273]  Right.
[02:44:51.613 --> 02:44:57.836]  Well, I just don't want people to try and find holes in what I'm saying because, you know, they've heard me say something in the past that was terrible.
[02:44:57.856 --> 02:44:59.316]  And I know I've done that.
[02:44:59.356 --> 02:45:10.741]  That's one of the things that I'm working on with the whole Slayer Tour is that, you know, 19 years ago, 19 years ago, Alex, I said something, but people are still holding on to it and they keep bringing it up and it keeps causing problems.
[02:45:11.401 --> 02:45:14.642]  Well, it's very diverse, but Dave, I interrupted you when you were getting into your worldview.
[02:45:14.682 --> 02:45:17.002]  What do you think about the Rapture?
[02:45:17.202 --> 02:45:18.383]  Because I've read the Old Testament.
[02:45:40.007 --> 02:45:44.130]  And it clearly says the Beast will wage war against the Saints and overcome them.
[02:45:44.450 --> 02:45:48.353]  How, overall, raptured out beforehand can the Beast wage war?
[02:45:48.593 --> 02:45:52.095]  How can he force people to take chips if everybody's submitting?
[02:45:52.596 --> 02:45:57.679]  And this is only a 150-year-old, 140-year-old doctrine of the pre-rapture.
[02:45:57.999 --> 02:46:01.321]  And so, because everybody believes... I talk to these phony Christians.
[02:46:01.762 --> 02:46:02.902]  They won't fight any evil.
[02:46:02.943 --> 02:46:04.804]  They say, praise God, it's getting more evil.
[02:46:04.984 --> 02:46:06.565]  That means I'll be teleported out.
[02:46:06.905 --> 02:46:09.667]  I don't think Captain Kirk is going to teleport them out.
[02:46:11.468 --> 02:46:13.008]  Well, I don't believe in the rapture.
[02:46:13.068 --> 02:46:19.771]  I don't know enough about it to even know what it is and the fact that, you know, all of a sudden I'm going to be here and then I'm going to be someplace else.
[02:46:20.252 --> 02:46:25.114]  My understanding is that I'm going to be witness to, you know, the great Armageddon.
[02:46:25.154 --> 02:46:34.638]  So, you know, I don't know this particular part because that's a little bit more cerebral than I've gotten into it because I've only been a Christian for a little while, but it's certainly good fodder.
[02:46:36.420 --> 02:46:37.361]  Well, that's amazing.
[02:46:37.641 --> 02:46:42.666]  You know, I will tell you, I grew up in Dallas and saw a lot of occult stuff and it was like an occult empire.
[02:46:42.686 --> 02:46:55.317]  I never really got into it, but, you know, I'd date this super good-looking girl who was a couple years older than me and, you know, go to her parents' house, giant mansion, and find out they were Satanists, and I would go out with this
[02:46:56.098 --> 02:46:56.318]  Yes, sir.
[02:47:12.719 --> 02:47:14.541]  But I wasn't because I have love in my heart.
[02:47:15.741 --> 02:47:33.873]  But I think seeing evil and not being perfect and then changing allows you to understand things and have discernment that people that have had a sheltered life or never experienced the power of the satanic empire, I believe that once you've been a little bit on the other side of it, it almost gives you an advantage because now I've been on both sides of the coin.
[02:47:34.651 --> 02:47:44.520]  Right, and that's basically what I was saying in the beginning about being able to have the credentials to talk to these fans, to be able to meet them where they're at.
[02:47:44.960 --> 02:47:46.621]  There's nothing worse than being lectured to.
[02:47:47.242 --> 02:48:02.255]  If someone wants to know something, as human beings we have, most of us when we're curious about something, they can take it to, they can get a human strength and be able to sit up for hours studying things.
[02:48:02.918 --> 02:48:05.060]  You know, if they're interested in it, you know.
[02:48:05.140 --> 02:48:07.983]  For me, if I'm not interested, I can be asleep within 30 seconds.
[02:48:08.843 --> 02:48:18.589]  But because you've been into the occult, you can actually, if people ask you, explain, this wasn't fun for me, and they wouldn't listen to some preacher, but they'd listen to Dave Mustaine of Megadeth.
[02:48:18.629 --> 02:48:19.070]  Yeah, they would.
[02:48:19.210 --> 02:48:25.574]  And that's the great thing about all of this, because I'm not misusing my celebrity to tell people what to do.
[02:48:26.374 --> 02:48:31.037]  We've always been really supportive of encouraging people to read.
[02:48:31.238 --> 02:48:34.800]  That's why I've tried to use words more than baby, baby in my songs.
[02:48:35.520 --> 02:48:44.128]  That's why we've had stuff that's been really provocative, stuff that really encourages our listeners to stay in school and to do something good and become great.
[02:48:49.934 --> 02:48:58.298]  What you're saying here today, and I know you're going to be a really great vessel for waking people up, but you say you've just now recently become a Christian.
[02:48:58.798 --> 02:49:12.165]  I think God's seal, the creator of the universe's seal, was on your heart from the beginning, because the fruits, you were the only heavy metal band that really didn't have that Satanism running through it, and everything you've done really was speaking against that system.
[02:49:13.143 --> 02:49:15.527]  And you said you didn't even understand what you were writing at the time.
[02:49:16.108 --> 02:49:18.471]  I think you were one of the lost sheep or the prodigal son.
[02:49:18.511 --> 02:49:24.641]  I think you've just come back home where you were always meant to be, but not in the false church, but in the real church that's in your heart.
[02:49:25.482 --> 02:49:26.764]  Well thanks.
[02:49:27.405 --> 02:49:28.026]  I'll accept that.
[02:49:29.658 --> 02:49:40.427]  I've always felt that there was something cool that there was a much deeper meaning to what I was doing playing on stage because I don't practice, Alex.
[02:49:40.487 --> 02:49:44.891]  I pick the guitar up about three days before we go on tour and I have to learn the songs again.
[02:49:45.450 --> 02:49:47.111]  And then we got on stage and played.
[02:49:47.571 --> 02:49:49.952]  And I don't know how that happened, it just happened.
[02:49:50.272 --> 02:49:57.136]  I know that my sister played piano when I was a kid and she asked me to play guitar with her and I thought, absolutely, anything to drown out that noise.
[02:49:57.896 --> 02:50:03.939]  And I started learning how to play guitar and I would put it down and I wouldn't even look at it.
[02:50:04.199 --> 02:50:07.320]  I've lived in this new apartment here since my wife and I are separated.
[02:50:07.380 --> 02:50:09.201]  I've been here for almost a month.
[02:50:09.221 --> 02:50:10.622]  There's a guitar here, I haven't touched it.
[02:50:12.206 --> 02:50:17.642]  It's really weird because you would think that it would be something that would be an extension of my body.
[02:50:21.243 --> 02:50:29.288]  Well, I mean, I think you're such a natural and that it's something that you pick up when you, you know, go out there to perform and just let it flow through you.
[02:50:29.608 --> 02:50:31.590]  We've got a final segment with Dave Mustaine.
[02:50:31.610 --> 02:50:33.111]  I know he's got some other stuff coming up.
[02:50:33.131 --> 02:50:41.196]  We'll see if I can twist his arm into five, ten minutes more because I want to be able to play a few more clips of his songs, but he's got to leave us in about ten minutes.
[02:50:41.416 --> 02:50:45.198]  I would imagine, Dave, that you'll join us again when you get back from Australia.
[02:50:45.538 --> 02:50:46.279]  I would love to do that.
[02:50:47.213 --> 02:50:47.633]  Amazing.
[02:50:47.673 --> 02:50:50.515]  Again, Megadeth.com, Dave Mustaine.
[02:50:50.775 --> 02:50:52.876]  We have links to it up on InfoWars.com.

[02:51:56.803 --> 02:51:58.345]  It's here.
[02:51:58.365 --> 02:52:09.733]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:52:10.113 --> 02:52:17.719]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:52:18.444 --> 02:52:25.488]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:52:25.889 --> 02:52:32.713]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying.
[02:52:33.266 --> 02:52:37.329]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:37.609 --> 02:52:41.172]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:41.573 --> 02:52:43.534]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:43.854 --> 02:52:47.757]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:53:01.345 --> 02:53:05.351]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[02:53:05.632 --> 02:53:08.496]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:53:08.917 --> 02:53:16.709]  Our God-given right to life and liberty, and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health, are in jeopardy if we the people
[02:53:16.969 --> 02:53:17.489]  We're good to go.
[02:53:39.650 --> 02:53:40.351]  We're good to go.
[02:54:30.245 --> 02:54:32.346]  By the way, the site is almost done.
[02:54:32.366 --> 02:54:33.846]  I'm going to go ahead and launch it today.
[02:54:34.606 --> 02:54:36.767]  It is falloftherepublic.com.
[02:54:37.107 --> 02:54:43.449]  We're building some of the subpages right now, but the new film is coming out October 21st, Fall of the Republic.
[02:54:43.989 --> 02:54:51.756]  And on Sunday's show, I'm going to show you the cover of the film, but the website is similar, falltherepublic.com.
[02:54:52.036 --> 02:54:54.578]  Megadeth.com is Dave Mustaine's band site.
[02:54:54.598 --> 02:54:56.920]  He's the founder, guitarist, and lead singer.
[02:54:57.360 --> 02:55:00.963]  The album is number one on many charts, number one on Amazon right now.
[02:55:01.003 --> 02:55:01.804]  They're going on tour.
[02:55:02.104 --> 02:55:03.145]  His new book is coming out.
[02:55:03.205 --> 02:55:05.967]  Find out about it all at megadeth.com.
[02:55:06.347 --> 02:55:09.630]  And you just heard the intro to Peace Sells there.
[02:55:09.890 --> 02:55:11.632]  Dave, we got about five minutes left.
[02:55:11.892 --> 02:55:13.053]  I've asked a lot of questions.
[02:55:13.575 --> 02:55:15.089]  Uh, what's on Dave Mustangs mind?
[02:55:15.936 --> 02:55:20.338]  Right now, I'm just preparing for the new tour coming up.
[02:55:20.758 --> 02:55:28.901]  I have something that was wrong with my neck and my back, so I've been doing a lot of physical therapy for that from all the head-banging over all the years.
[02:55:30.702 --> 02:55:37.004]  Just working on myself, trying to work out things with my kids and my marriage and stuff.
[02:55:37.104 --> 02:55:39.385]  Just looking at my life in general.
[02:55:39.405 --> 02:55:41.126]  What do I do?
[02:55:41.206 --> 02:55:42.046]  What's my role?
[02:55:42.487 --> 02:55:43.367]  How can I help people?
[02:55:45.652 --> 02:55:52.215]  You've got another interview coming up, but Dave's going to be back on with us in November when his next tour gets ready to kick off.
[02:55:52.255 --> 02:56:00.858]  We'll have a lot more to talk about, but let me just tell you from my perspective, we're getting calls, emails, huge comments on our message board, in the comment sections.
[02:56:01.178 --> 02:56:09.322]  People love, and I'm talking about serious death fans, serious Megadeth fans, they love the new album and I think it's going to be one of your biggest and greatest, I guess,
[02:56:09.822 --> 02:56:11.242]  Well, we've got a lot of great reviews.
[02:56:11.262 --> 02:56:16.364]  You know, by no means is anything over yet and this band would be really blessed if we were able to gain some of your following.
[02:56:34.893 --> 02:56:38.116]  And basically, you know, you and I are speaking the same language.
[02:56:38.136 --> 02:56:40.058]  We're singing from the same, you know, hymnal.
[02:56:40.078 --> 02:56:46.203]  But, you know, what we're trying to do is get these tours out of the way.
[02:56:46.904 --> 02:56:53.029]  Yeah, you can plan on us being back in the studio or me visiting you out there for some barbecue in November.
[02:56:53.649 --> 02:56:54.670]  Man, that is awesome.
[02:56:54.690 --> 02:56:57.292]  I'll come out whenever I'm out in your neck of the woods.
[02:56:57.312 --> 02:56:58.614]  Maybe we can hook up for some barbecue.
[02:56:58.634 --> 02:56:59.254]  But it is better.
[02:56:59.735 --> 02:57:00.295]  It is better here.
[02:57:00.315 --> 02:57:01.216]  You're out in California.
[02:57:01.236 --> 02:57:02.417]  I guess they got good sushi there.
[02:57:04.801 --> 02:57:07.382]  Everybody says they've got good sushi out here and you know what?
[02:57:07.402 --> 02:57:11.203]  You go into one of these places and it's like, I didn't know tuna was green.
[02:57:11.803 --> 02:57:24.086]  So anyways, back to what we were talking about before, you know it would be really great to invite you and your crew down to our concert too if you want to bring your film crew down there and we can talk some more there and show you a little bit about what I do.
[02:57:24.933 --> 02:57:26.054]  Absolutely killer!
[02:57:26.274 --> 02:57:29.115]  Well, Dave, we'll stay in touch with you and your management.
[02:57:29.616 --> 02:57:33.578]  And you are really trailblazing with your record label.
[02:57:33.798 --> 02:57:34.838]  People should support it.
[02:57:34.899 --> 02:57:35.859]  It is independent.
[02:57:36.159 --> 02:57:36.920]  It is Maverick.
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:38.480]  It is original and authentic.
[02:57:39.061 --> 02:57:41.442]  Dave Mustaine, founder of Megadeth.
[02:57:41.762 --> 02:57:43.123]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:57:43.163 --> 02:57:45.224]  The new album is In Game.
[02:57:46.825 --> 02:57:47.705]  Dave, thank you so much.
[02:57:47.725 --> 02:57:48.366]  You're welcome, Alex.
[02:57:48.566 --> 02:57:48.826]  Take care.
[02:57:48.846 --> 02:57:49.566]  All right.
[02:57:49.586 --> 02:57:50.567]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:57:51.107 --> 02:57:52.368]  Well, that is exciting.
[02:57:52.388 --> 02:57:53.168]  There goes Dave.
[02:57:53.769 --> 02:57:53.989]  Man!
[02:57:55.269 --> 02:58:00.093]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, and Muse is doing interviews saying 9-11's an inside job.
[02:58:00.113 --> 02:58:00.894]  They've been on the show.
[02:58:01.254 --> 02:58:03.917]  Bellamy, it's one of the number one bands right now.
[02:58:04.277 --> 02:58:12.484]  If I told you some of the other music icons I've talked to or that I know or that I know through other people that are aware of the New World Order, you wouldn't believe it.
[02:58:12.824 --> 02:58:14.666]  The Hollywood people, you wouldn't believe it.
[02:58:15.967 --> 02:58:16.967]  There is an awakening.
[02:58:16.988 --> 02:58:19.510]  The general public doesn't want world government, world tyranny.
[02:58:19.770 --> 02:58:22.092]  That's why at the G20 they've got to have the police come out
[02:58:22.924 --> 02:58:29.467]  In fact, I meant when Dave was on to play that armored vehicle audio and video where they're saying, you are not allowed to assemble.
[02:58:30.167 --> 02:58:40.551]  In fact, we'll come back with that after this break, and then we'll come in with the music after that, John, and then we're gonna get a report from the G20 from our reporters on the ground, and then Bob Chapman pops back in.
[02:58:40.591 --> 02:58:41.291]  Stay with us!
[02:58:43.772 --> 02:58:45.393]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.273 --> 02:58:48.574]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.243 --> 02:58:54.165]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:58:54.625 --> 02:58:57.786]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:58:58.267 --> 02:59:02.629]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:59:02.829 --> 02:59:08.432]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:59:08.712 --> 02:59:13.215]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:59:13.476 --> 02:59:16.538]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:59:17.098 --> 02:59:21.521]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:59:21.922 --> 02:59:28.226]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:59:28.486 --> 02:59:30.428]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:59:30.928 --> 02:59:33.750]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:59:34.130 --> 02:59:38.173]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[02:59:38.614 --> 02:59:40.395]  That's MySolarBackup.com.

[02:59:41.155 --> 02:59:41.356]  Don't wait.
[02:59:41.396 --> 02:59:41.956]  Call today.
[02:59:42.016 --> 02:59:43.037]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:43.057 --> 02:59:44.338]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:00.683 --> 03:00:05.427]  Look at me, I don't believe in God.
[03:00:05.447 --> 03:00:07.289]  Talk to him every day.
[03:00:24.642 --> 03:00:26.323]  I don't support your system.
[03:00:26.623 --> 03:00:30.804]  I go to court when I have to.
[03:00:30.844 --> 03:00:33.225]  What do you mean I can't get to work on time?
[03:00:33.385 --> 03:00:37.726]  I've got nothing better to do.
[03:00:37.786 --> 03:00:40.007]  What do you mean I don't pay my bills?
[03:00:41.047 --> 03:00:43.408]  What do you think I'm broke?
[03:00:43.708 --> 03:00:43.848]  Huh?
[03:00:50.582 --> 03:00:53.984]  I'll be the first in line.
[03:00:54.084 --> 03:00:57.246]  But it better work this time.
[03:00:57.306 --> 03:01:00.268]  What do you mean I hurt your feelings?
[03:01:00.608 --> 03:01:05.912]  I didn't know you had any feelings.
[03:01:06.012 --> 03:01:10.755]  What do you mean I ain't kind?
[03:01:12.293 --> 03:01:13.834]  Just not your kind.
[03:01:13.874 --> 03:01:24.478]  What do you mean I couldn't be the President of the United States of America?
[03:01:24.678 --> 03:01:26.299]  Tell me something.
[03:01:26.459 --> 03:01:29.920]  It's still we, the people, right?
[03:01:31.481 --> 03:01:36.363]  If there's a new way, I'll be the first in line.
[03:01:38.144 --> 03:01:38.904]  But it better work,
[03:01:41.654 --> 03:01:45.217]  I'm Peace Sells!
[03:01:45.977 --> 03:01:47.518]  Peace Sells!
[03:01:47.598 --> 03:01:48.439]  I love that end part.
[03:01:48.859 --> 03:01:49.460]  It's coming up.
[03:01:49.560 --> 03:01:50.300]  Break it up, baby!
[03:01:50.320 --> 03:01:50.420]  Yeah!
[03:01:50.460 --> 03:01:54.343]  We're taking over the New World Order!
[03:01:54.383 --> 03:01:56.505]  Yeah!
[03:01:58.126 --> 03:01:58.546]  Yeah!
[03:01:59.387 --> 03:02:00.728]  Let them see your war face!
[03:02:18.567 --> 03:02:24.215]  We used to go to meet people from school and high school that wanted to get in a fight.
[03:02:24.695 --> 03:02:29.181]  We'd pull into a field, just crank it up, slide out of the car, and just start going wild.
[03:02:29.241 --> 03:02:30.022]  But you know what?
[03:02:30.042 --> 03:02:32.265]  I put all that energy into fighting the New World Order now.
[03:02:32.726 --> 03:02:33.427]  Crank it up!
[03:02:51.361 --> 03:03:00.928]  Man, that is rockin' baby!
[03:03:01.148 --> 03:03:09.294]  Yeah!
[03:03:09.534 --> 03:03:20.062]  Dave Mustaine joining the fight against the New World Order.
[03:03:21.078 --> 03:03:26.483]  Control of demonstrations and lethal ammunition can cause the risk of injury to those who remain.
[03:03:53.266 --> 03:03:59.511]  By order of the City of Pittsburgh Chief Police, I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[03:03:59.531 --> 03:04:06.097]  By order of the City of Pittsburgh Chief Police, I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[03:04:06.177 --> 03:04:09.680]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[03:04:10.100 --> 03:04:11.962]  You must leave the immediate vicinity.
[03:04:22.002 --> 03:04:23.183]  It's what these police are doing.
[03:04:23.223 --> 03:04:24.003]  There's the crime.
[03:04:25.104 --> 03:04:26.105]  Unbelievable.
[03:04:26.125 --> 03:04:28.047]  It's a great point Jaron just made.
[03:04:28.067 --> 03:04:31.309]  The thing that looks like a crime is those ringwraiths and those black outfits.
[03:04:31.349 --> 03:04:32.170]  That's the true evil.
[03:04:32.490 --> 03:04:33.411]  Posing is good.
[03:04:34.472 --> 03:04:37.294]  You see they look foul and they are foul.
[03:04:38.715 --> 03:04:40.417]  Some of us look foul but feel fair.
[03:04:42.458 --> 03:04:44.019]  Others look fair but feel foul.
[03:04:45.140 --> 03:04:45.861]  Trust your gut.
[03:04:46.519 --> 03:04:48.001]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:48.101 --> 03:04:49.582]  InfoWars.com.
[03:04:50.123 --> 03:04:51.444]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:04:51.724 --> 03:04:55.949]  We're going directly live to the G20 with world government being announced straight ahead.
[03:05:02.076 --> 03:05:04.659]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:05.079 --> 03:05:10.045]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:10.406 --> 03:05:12.148]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.468 --> 03:05:17.274]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.474 --> 03:05:18.355]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.635 --> 03:05:19.375]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.756 --> 03:05:21.357]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.637 --> 03:05:22.457]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.717 --> 03:05:24.778]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.918 --> 03:05:26.019]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:26.259 --> 03:05:27.600]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.780 --> 03:05:32.843]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:33.043 --> 03:05:36.245]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.625 --> 03:05:40.107]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.447 --> 03:05:41.427]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.668 --> 03:05:42.288]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.588 --> 03:05:43.488]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.688 --> 03:05:44.409]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.429 --> 03:05:45.449]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.709 --> 03:05:48.470]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:05:50.531 --> 03:05:51.451]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:01.198 --> 03:06:06.365]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:06.505 --> 03:06:08.448]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[03:06:08.568 --> 03:06:10.871]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:11.031 --> 03:06:12.874]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:13.314 --> 03:06:14.636]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.936 --> 03:06:15.958]  There is a solution.

[03:07:01.784 --> 03:07:03.426]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[03:07:03.546 --> 03:07:04.987]  Say no to toxic overload.
[03:07:05.067 --> 03:07:06.168]  Say no to chemicals.
[03:07:06.388 --> 03:07:08.190]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[03:07:08.330 --> 03:07:17.078]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[03:07:17.138 --> 03:07:22.383]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[03:07:22.543 --> 03:07:24.165]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[03:07:24.345 --> 03:07:31.753]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.

[03:08:03.300 --> 03:08:08.323]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:08.703 --> 03:08:11.024]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:11.044 --> 03:08:16.067]  Folks, we're launching the Charlie Sheen 9-11 offensive against the globalists.
[03:08:16.747 --> 03:08:20.970]  Finishing the film, which is now officially done.
[03:08:21.930 --> 03:08:27.013]  Being sent off to be mass-produced so we can have it before it starts shipping October 21st, follow the Republic.
[03:08:27.634 --> 03:08:28.975]  We've got one trailer out there.
[03:08:28.995 --> 03:08:31.318]  We're going to have other incredible trailers in the next few weeks.
[03:08:31.939 --> 03:08:36.223]  It's going to go on pre-sale tomorrow at Infowars.com.
[03:08:36.243 --> 03:08:40.888]  When you order first, that means that in the orders, it ships out first.
[03:08:40.908 --> 03:08:47.855]  And we're probably going to, just like with Camp FEMA, probably going to start shipping this a few days before October 21st on that Wednesday.
[03:08:47.895 --> 03:08:49.697]  We're going to shoot to start shipping Monday.
[03:08:50.529 --> 03:08:52.851]  With UPS, everybody gets it within three days.
[03:08:52.931 --> 03:08:55.813]  Most people in the U.S., depending on where you live, within two days.
[03:08:55.833 --> 03:08:58.815]  So a lot of people get it on the 21st of October.
[03:08:59.116 --> 03:09:02.478]  Pre-order today at InfoWars.com.
[03:09:02.518 --> 03:09:05.701]  In fact, I meant to get in this morning and tell them to go ahead and get it up on the shopping cart.
[03:09:05.721 --> 03:09:06.461]  We haven't done that.
[03:09:06.981 --> 03:09:13.727]  Kurt Nemo is finishing up the Fall of the Republic sub-pages, because we've all been racing with other work.
[03:09:13.767 --> 03:09:17.590]  In fact, can we put FalloftheRepublic.com up on screen for folks?
[03:09:17.970 --> 03:09:19.411]  Now, this isn't the video cover.
[03:09:19.986 --> 03:09:21.947]  But we'll show you the video cover coming up this weekend.
[03:09:21.967 --> 03:09:23.868]  It'll be posted on Infowars.com.
[03:09:24.929 --> 03:09:27.330]  We'll probably, even this afternoon, get it up for pre-sale.
[03:09:28.211 --> 03:09:29.712]  Friday afternoon, Friday evening.
[03:09:30.952 --> 03:09:34.935]  Now, almost every new film I make, I say, this is my greatest film ever.
[03:09:36.295 --> 03:09:37.556]  Because each film gets better.
[03:09:37.616 --> 03:09:40.718]  I mean, you saw what we went from, you know,
[03:09:42.006 --> 03:10:07.896]  America Destroyed by Design, to Police State 2000, to Police State 2 The Takeover, right through Police State 3, Matrix of Evil, Road to Tyranny, Martial Law, and all the other documentaries like Terror Storm, and The Order of Death, and Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, and American Dictators, and Endgame was a whole other level information-wise.
[03:10:07.936 --> 03:10:11.458]  It's the total combo that really gives you a good view on everything.
[03:10:12.358 --> 03:10:21.963]  The Obama Deception, the biggest film we've ever released, the most viral, the most successful, the most DVDs handed out, people have made copies of and given it to people, the biggest film we've had.
[03:10:23.223 --> 03:10:26.405]  Conservatively, over 100 million people have seen my films free online.
[03:10:26.885 --> 03:10:29.846]  I mean, it's gotta be over 25 million now just with Obama Deception.
[03:10:31.467 --> 03:10:34.228]  And of course, I executed, produced, loosed, changed, traveled, cut, seen by millions.
[03:10:34.268 --> 03:10:37.810]  The point is, is that when I tell you that Fall of the Republic
[03:10:39.131 --> 03:10:41.692]  Blows everything we've ever made away.
[03:10:41.992 --> 03:10:42.832]  Believe me.
[03:10:44.492 --> 03:10:48.093]  My most expensive film was about $120,000 to make.
[03:10:48.133 --> 03:10:50.133]  That was endgame.
[03:10:52.074 --> 03:10:55.655]  Obama Deception, because we rushed the making of it, and it's really good, was only about $80,000.
[03:10:56.875 --> 03:11:01.656]  This film, for me, it sounds like nothing to people that are, you know, big huge movie makers, $200,000 budget.
[03:11:01.676 --> 03:11:04.076]  To give you an idea.
[03:11:04.276 --> 03:11:06.457]  And six months making it,
[03:11:08.089 --> 03:11:10.955]  I mean, I'm up here until 1, 2 at night, 6, 7 days a week.
[03:11:11.896 --> 03:11:13.319]  This thing is unbelievable.
[03:11:13.499 --> 03:11:16.886]  I mean, and oh, here's another big announcement about it.
[03:11:17.287 --> 03:11:18.609]  It's Fall of the Republic Volume 1.
[03:11:20.160 --> 03:11:30.247]  We ended up, about a month ago, with a four-hour film, all this new info coming in, and I said, there's no way, I can't make... Now, the film is two hours, 22 minutes long.
[03:11:30.488 --> 03:11:31.728]  No, 24 minutes, I added.
[03:11:31.748 --> 03:11:38.173]  I made everybody shoot some more stuff last night, on some other issues, we just added it, but that was why it was finally done this morning.
[03:11:38.193 --> 03:11:40.535]  That's why Aaron's not here, he was up all night.
[03:11:42.456 --> 03:11:45.058]  Fall of the Republic is 224 minutes long,
[03:11:47.654 --> 03:11:55.220]  It has 19 interviews, but also footage on the ground, voiceover, documents, I mean video clips, the research that went into it.
[03:11:56.020 --> 03:11:57.942]  No film I've ever made has as much research.
[03:11:58.542 --> 03:11:59.563]  And it's part one.
[03:12:01.064 --> 03:12:05.307]  It covers how the banks did the takeover, the derivatives, the scam, their world government plan.
[03:12:07.248 --> 03:12:13.113]  It gets into the eugenics, TV, mind control, how they control society, the citizen spy networks, just
[03:12:14.298 --> 03:12:20.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's got Jesse Ventura, Max Keiser, Bob Bowman, Webster Tarpley, George Humphrey.
[03:12:23.541 --> 03:12:25.001]  I mean, the list just goes on and on.
[03:12:25.021 --> 03:12:27.522]  In fact, I've got to get a full list of that.
[03:12:27.542 --> 03:12:28.723]  19 interviews.
[03:12:28.803 --> 03:12:35.705]  I put people on 17 airplanes to fly to Canada and California and Florida.
[03:12:36.565 --> 03:12:38.686]  John Perkins, Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[03:12:40.737 --> 03:12:41.898]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[03:12:42.318 --> 03:12:46.182]  I mean, the list goes on and on and on.
[03:12:46.642 --> 03:12:47.343]  Oath Keepers.
[03:12:47.523 --> 03:12:49.205]  We went to 10 cities in California.
[03:12:50.406 --> 03:12:51.026]  17 missions.
[03:12:51.847 --> 03:12:54.169]  We flew two groups of people here to be interviewed.
[03:12:55.610 --> 03:12:56.331]  I'm in the film.
[03:12:57.752 --> 03:13:02.457]  And the voiceover is the best boiled-down script of key information.
[03:13:02.897 --> 03:13:07.061]  The analysis... Again, it's going on sale this afternoon or tomorrow.
[03:13:08.479 --> 03:13:12.300]  In the next few weeks we've got two big trailers coming out that'll give you a sneak peek at it.
[03:13:12.900 --> 03:13:15.941]  Start pre-ordering tonight or tomorrow when it goes up.
[03:13:16.361 --> 03:13:22.022]  Falloftherepublic.com That says InfoWars.com Fall of the Republic.
[03:13:22.622 --> 03:13:23.463]  The main site's not up?
[03:13:25.143 --> 03:13:27.143]  So people can just go to Falloftherepublic.com and get it?
[03:13:27.924 --> 03:13:28.344]  Okay, good.
[03:13:28.544 --> 03:13:37.926]  Yeah, so the actual URL is Falloftherepublic.com I'm just looking at InfoWars URL subpage version of it.
[03:13:38.567 --> 03:13:39.307]  They're on screen.
[03:13:39.628 --> 03:13:42.249]  But the point is, they've denied world government was here.
[03:13:42.489 --> 03:13:44.270]  They've denied world government was happening.
[03:13:44.710 --> 03:13:46.631]  They've denied world government was a reality.
[03:13:46.911 --> 03:13:50.773]  And then now they've had to admit it's all real, and we go back over their history, everything.
[03:13:50.813 --> 03:13:51.293]  I'm telling you.
[03:13:52.194 --> 03:13:57.756]  I was watching this film last night at about 1.30 in the morning after I got off Coast to Coast AM.
[03:13:57.956 --> 03:13:59.137]  Been working on it before and then after.
[03:13:59.932 --> 03:14:07.938]  And I said to Aaron and to Rob Jacobson, who really deserve as much credit as myself or anybody else in this film.
[03:14:08.138 --> 03:14:11.440]  I couldn't do it without these two men and their dedication.
[03:14:11.460 --> 03:14:20.667]  Because you can get more people on it, but if you have something like this, it has to be a small number so that... I'm not comparing myself to Stanley Kubrick, but people said if you go to his sets, there'd be ten people on them.
[03:14:20.847 --> 03:14:23.369]  If you go to a regular Hollywood set, there'd be hundreds or thousands.
[03:14:24.167 --> 03:14:25.008]  It's the same thing here.
[03:14:25.048 --> 03:14:26.870]  It's just a very small, knit group.
[03:14:27.271 --> 03:14:37.623]  Burmess has worked on it, Rob Dew, Jason Douglas, Mike McWhorter, Mr. Dill, everybody who was involved in this.
[03:14:37.663 --> 03:14:41.447]  Glenn Dill, the guys that did the music, Derek Einkhoff.
[03:14:42.825 --> 03:14:55.489]  Craig, Will Jones, all the guys are such great musicians because we got three guys at work here that are in the same band here in Austin that the music is title track in a major motion picture good.
[03:14:56.070 --> 03:15:03.792]  And I love Mr. Reynolds who we've used in other films and he's great and he's gotten orchestras together for it.
[03:15:03.832 --> 03:15:07.513]  We shouldn't have the time to do that but this turned out just as good and different.
[03:15:10.222 --> 03:15:11.623]  Rob Jacobson made some of the music.
[03:15:11.703 --> 03:15:15.704]  I mean, it is just, it is a out-of-the-part success.
[03:15:15.745 --> 03:15:20.647]  This is going to be devastating to the New World Order and all the glory goes to God.
[03:15:20.667 --> 03:15:30.711]  I tell you, to bust your butt like this, to get black circles around your eyes, to accelerate your aging, you know, working so hard to your hair falling out, I don't care.
[03:15:31.151 --> 03:15:36.314]  I love just spending myself on a worthy cause, to know those dedications, those passions,
[03:15:37.734 --> 03:15:39.935]  To be able to make something like Fall of the Republic.
[03:15:40.096 --> 03:15:40.896]  It's volume one.
[03:15:40.956 --> 03:15:47.300]  Volume two is gonna be eugenics, mind control, the concentration camps, and how to defeat them.
[03:15:47.540 --> 03:15:49.401]  There's a lot of solutions in this film as well.
[03:15:51.523 --> 03:15:52.823]  Uh, Gerald Salente's in it.
[03:15:52.863 --> 03:15:54.024]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[03:15:54.424 --> 03:15:58.087]  The point is, this is heads above.
[03:15:58.667 --> 03:16:00.748]  Before, the films were a little better than the film before.
[03:16:00.768 --> 03:16:01.509]  This is a whole
[03:16:02.056 --> 03:16:03.177]  It is a quantum leap!
[03:16:03.497 --> 03:16:06.660]  And we have better computers and more research and we're better at what we do now.
[03:16:07.100 --> 03:16:09.402]  It is a quantum leap!
[03:16:09.983 --> 03:16:15.327]  A whole nother level above any film I have ever produced.
[03:16:17.729 --> 03:16:19.210]  It is a quantum leap.
[03:16:19.250 --> 03:16:21.252]  The IT guys helping us with the systems to get it done.
[03:16:21.372 --> 03:16:21.813]  Everybody.
[03:16:22.393 --> 03:16:23.894]  And you the listeners that have supported us.
[03:16:23.934 --> 03:16:29.940]  You especially need credit for your financial support, buying the other books and videos and t-shirts and materials and supporting our sponsors.
[03:16:31.232 --> 03:16:39.102]  Have made this possible where we have the financing to send 17 crews out at around $5,000 per trip.
[03:16:39.162 --> 03:16:42.667]  I don't know what 17 times 5,000.
[03:16:42.747 --> 03:16:46.512]  I've done the math and the total budget of this thing, the graphics, everything.
[03:16:49.082 --> 03:16:51.543]  It's just so fulfilling to be on the right side of history.
[03:16:51.583 --> 03:16:53.124]  It's so fulfilling to know the truth.
[03:16:53.444 --> 03:16:54.965]  It's so fulfilling to be proven right.
[03:16:55.365 --> 03:17:05.511]  It's so fulfilling when we get the death threats and the COINTELPRO and the lies and the attacks, each one worse than the next, to know they're attacking us because we are doing good, because we are having an effect in history.
[03:17:05.711 --> 03:17:07.372]  We do matter with this species.
[03:17:07.892 --> 03:17:10.213]  And the way the film ends, I'm going to leave that as a surprise.
[03:17:13.635 --> 03:17:14.416]  Follow the Republic.
[03:17:14.456 --> 03:17:18.338]  I'm going to quit waxing here eloquent about it, but it is just...
[03:17:19.434 --> 03:17:20.255]  Follow the Republic.
[03:17:20.315 --> 03:17:21.595]  Goes on pre-sale tonight or tomorrow.
[03:17:21.615 --> 03:17:22.096]  I'm not sure when.
[03:17:22.116 --> 03:17:24.718]  We've got to get it up all properly at Infowars.com.
[03:17:24.758 --> 03:17:25.898]  You can start writing to us.
[03:17:25.978 --> 03:17:26.699]  It's $19.95.
[03:17:27.019 --> 03:17:33.163]  You start writing to us at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[03:17:33.744 --> 03:17:35.585]  Of course, we're not really using that address anymore.
[03:17:35.825 --> 03:17:37.466]  It's better to send it to Infowars, P.O.
[03:17:37.486 --> 03:17:38.207]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[03:17:42.526 --> 03:17:46.748]  PO Box 19549, Austin, TX 78760 or InfoWars.com.
[03:17:47.068 --> 03:17:49.869]  And of course, October 21st it will debut in super high quality.
[03:17:50.109 --> 03:17:52.790]  We're even trying to put it out on the web in actual high def.
[03:17:53.190 --> 03:17:54.210]  I think we're going to be able to do that.
[03:17:54.270 --> 03:17:58.672]  It's close to high def right now in the highest quality, but we're having a bunch of versions at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:17:59.072 --> 03:18:01.013]  Okay, I got my guys holding.
[03:18:01.473 --> 03:18:05.094]  Let's go to Jason Burmas and then Jason Douglas also on the phone from the middle of the crowd.
[03:18:05.374 --> 03:18:07.595]  What's happened since an hour and a half ago when I talked to you?
[03:18:08.342 --> 03:18:10.506]  Well, now we're on Norfolk, Alex.
[03:18:10.546 --> 03:18:14.993]  The police force has a much greater presence as we reach downtown.
[03:18:15.133 --> 03:18:17.457]  I told you you're gonna march in, they're gonna surround you.
[03:18:18.582 --> 03:18:20.123]  It's very possible.
[03:18:20.183 --> 03:18:29.188]  I'm not sure where this is ending right now, but I've got video of hundreds of police officers now masked at the blocks, many of them in riot gear.
[03:18:29.448 --> 03:18:30.869]  Many of them are a little overzealous.
[03:18:30.969 --> 03:18:40.034]  I mean, some people are throwing the peace sign up, but a young lady, again, not weighing more than 105 pounds, dared to put one of her feet on the sign.
[03:18:42.628 --> 03:18:43.569]  I got it on video.
[03:18:43.889 --> 03:18:45.269]  I mean, come on!
[03:18:45.289 --> 03:18:52.313]  You know, I just keep running into Cindy Sheehan and these masses of thousands of people, and Cindy was standing next to her.
[03:18:52.593 --> 03:18:54.714]  She couldn't believe that he even raised her baton!
[03:18:54.794 --> 03:18:55.535]  I couldn't believe it!
[03:18:56.175 --> 03:18:59.477]  It's a little bit of controlled madness right now, Alex.
[03:19:00.397 --> 03:19:01.318]  It's pretty crazy.
[03:19:01.358 --> 03:19:02.738]  We are mobile yet again.
[03:19:02.938 --> 03:19:07.501]  I stopped at the Capitol for a while while there was some sort of a concert going on.
[03:19:08.141 --> 03:19:14.743]  And right now I can see, I believe it's the 7th Street or Clemente Bridge, I'm not sure which one.
[03:19:15.924 --> 03:19:23.646]  I can tell you I'm at the corner of 6th Avenue and maybe 6th and 7th Street where they converge.
[03:19:24.026 --> 03:19:29.288]  And there are thousands of people and hundreds of police officers courting on the side streets right now.
[03:19:29.828 --> 03:19:31.049]  Yeah, that's it.
[03:19:31.069 --> 03:19:33.030]  They're getting ready to lock down the main protest.
[03:19:33.050 --> 03:19:34.130]  You guys need to split up.
[03:19:34.210 --> 03:19:39.973]  Somebody at the front, somebody at the back with a plan to get out of there quick if they start closing it down.
[03:19:40.013 --> 03:19:40.673]  Stay there, Jason.
[03:19:40.693 --> 03:19:42.674]  I want more from you and Jason Douglas as well.
[03:19:43.014 --> 03:19:46.816]  Jason Douglas, Jason Burmess, Rob Dude doing a great job.
[03:19:46.916 --> 03:19:47.476]  Pray for him.
[03:19:47.977 --> 03:19:49.217]  On the ground at the G20.
[03:19:49.317 --> 03:19:50.698]  Open world government being announced.
[03:19:51.218 --> 03:19:52.759]  What an insane show today.
[03:19:52.779 --> 03:19:56.421]  Dave Mustaine on the heels of Congressman Ron Paul and Congressman Grayson.
[03:19:56.861 --> 03:19:59.623]  Yesterday, more huge guests coming up in the next few weeks.
[03:19:59.783 --> 03:20:00.303]  Stay with us.
[03:20:01.684 --> 03:20:04.706]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[03:20:05.066 --> 03:20:08.668]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[03:20:08.968 --> 03:20:12.430]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[03:20:12.690 --> 03:20:19.514]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride,
[03:20:22.622 --> 03:20:22.862]  I think so.
[03:20:51.428 --> 03:20:56.391]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[03:20:56.591 --> 03:21:00.933]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y today.
[03:21:01.673 --> 03:21:05.295]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[03:21:05.595 --> 03:21:09.137]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[03:21:09.417 --> 03:21:18.222]  Midas Resources, a team of handpicked financial specialists with decades of financial experience who are ready to provide you with state-of-the-art, up-to-date financial services.

[03:21:49.341 --> 03:21:54.709]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[03:22:01.866 --> 03:22:03.907]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[03:22:04.047 --> 03:22:06.449]  I've come with a message of information.
[03:22:06.469 --> 03:22:09.031]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:22:09.051 --> 03:22:10.271]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:22:10.291 --> 03:22:11.912]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:22:12.012 --> 03:22:14.834]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:22:14.874 --> 03:22:18.536]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the bilateral commission, the CFR?
[03:22:28.189 --> 03:22:33.058]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:22:36.835 --> 03:22:37.936]  How dare you?
[03:22:39.458 --> 03:22:44.322]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:22:44.523 --> 03:22:46.965]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:22:47.065 --> 03:22:53.671]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[03:22:53.711 --> 03:22:56.314]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[03:22:56.554 --> 03:22:58.576]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:22:58.836 --> 03:23:01.299]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[03:23:02.335 --> 03:23:07.117]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[03:23:07.497 --> 03:23:10.638]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[03:23:10.998 --> 03:23:16.440]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[03:23:16.720 --> 03:23:19.161]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[03:23:19.281 --> 03:23:23.342]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[03:23:23.822 --> 03:23:26.543]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[03:23:26.983 --> 03:23:32.429]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[03:23:32.729 --> 03:23:34.631]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:23:34.991 --> 03:23:43.300]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[03:23:43.540 --> 03:23:44.541]  Don't pick your nose.
[03:23:44.921 --> 03:23:49.202]  Don't shake hands, and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[03:23:49.482 --> 03:23:54.383]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[03:23:54.604 --> 03:23:56.284]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[03:23:56.344 --> 03:23:58.064]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:23:58.565 --> 03:24:00.065]  Be well and stay well.
[03:24:00.285 --> 03:24:01.025]  Best MZ.
[03:24:21.281 --> 03:24:27.646]  By order of the City of Pittsburgh Chief Police, I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[03:24:27.666 --> 03:24:33.811]  By order of the City of Pittsburgh Chief Police, I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[03:24:33.851 --> 03:24:35.473]  This is yesterday in Pittsburgh.
[03:24:35.533 --> 03:24:36.734]  Same thing's going on now.
[03:24:36.754 --> 03:24:42.979]  This is not a flashback to Police State 2000 shot in 1999 with the Marines drilling to take over U.S.
[03:24:43.019 --> 03:24:44.180]  City saying the same thing.
[03:24:44.921 --> 03:24:48.004]  This is what the military, NORTHCOM, Homeland Security is for.
[03:24:48.444 --> 03:24:49.205]  It is for you.
[03:24:49.385 --> 03:24:54.349]  Mainstream news announcing Obama's President of the World, bringing us into the New World Order.
[03:24:54.389 --> 03:24:56.271]  Those are the headlines.
[03:24:56.291 --> 03:24:59.694]  8,000 plus articles in Google News with the term New World Order in them.
[03:25:00.214 --> 03:25:03.577]  Jason Burmess, what is it like to see this actually unfolding?
[03:25:04.745 --> 03:25:07.147]  Honestly, it's extremely encouraging, Alex.
[03:25:07.187 --> 03:25:10.769]  This protest has gone much better than the one yesterday.
[03:25:10.789 --> 03:25:13.151]  Again, I'm not hoping for disaster at the end.
[03:25:13.431 --> 03:25:16.453]  We are currently crossing the bridge by the thousands.
[03:25:16.773 --> 03:25:20.215]  When you see a helicopter aerial shot of this, you will be astounded.
[03:25:20.815 --> 03:25:24.598]  Again, thousands of people trying to get their message out.
[03:25:24.678 --> 03:25:26.819]  Riot police lining the streets.
[03:25:26.979 --> 03:25:29.821]  I don't know what's going to be in store for us on the other side of the bridge.
[03:25:30.241 --> 03:25:33.924]  As I said, as we approach this, the riot gear police
[03:25:34.444 --> 03:25:37.451]  And the military presence became much, much greater.
[03:25:38.780 --> 03:25:49.047]  Jason, you're going to be live Sunday, 6 to 9 p.m., but I want to have you, Rob Dew, and Jason Douglas in studio in the first hour, Sunday, when you're back.
[03:25:49.527 --> 03:26:03.356]  And if you guys can come in and get a few of the key video clips, like what Douglas says he has of them sound canoning people on their front porch and little kids, we'll play some clips of that on the radio and at PrisonPlanet.tv on Sunday, ahead of your show.
[03:26:03.376 --> 03:26:05.477]  I know they've got to get back to their families, they've been gone all week.
[03:26:06.397 --> 03:26:08.839]  As soon as I get off that plane, I will start capturing video.
[03:26:08.859 --> 03:26:13.201]  This is just too important not to get out to the masses as soon as possible.
[03:26:20.393 --> 03:26:28.097]  Yeah, we should have probably sent another just web person you could hand the stuff off to to do it, but then we didn't send the right equipment, but that's okay.
[03:26:28.798 --> 03:26:31.279]  You know, we're not professional soldiers in the Info War here.
[03:26:31.299 --> 03:26:35.362]  We're professional amateurs doing the best we can to fight the New World Order.
[03:26:36.182 --> 03:26:37.783]  Let's go to Jason Douglas.
[03:26:37.803 --> 03:26:41.725]  Stay there, Burmese, but I want to go back to Jason Douglas.
[03:26:42.105 --> 03:26:42.946]  Two Jasons here.
[03:26:43.286 --> 03:26:44.907]  Douglas, what have you been seeing happening?
[03:26:45.507 --> 03:26:48.429]  Well, right now I'm at 6th Avenue and Wood Street.
[03:26:49.325 --> 03:26:56.907]  And basically what they're doing is, as we move block by block, they collapse, you know, the group of police officers.
[03:26:57.447 --> 03:27:05.049]  And right now it's about a hundred foot deep of police officers basically pushing the marchers to some undisclosed location.
[03:27:05.409 --> 03:27:08.289]  So as I said, as I said, they've now gotten behind you.
[03:27:08.309 --> 03:27:11.470]  They're going to be waiting in front and block you off all at one spot.
[03:27:12.975 --> 03:27:14.576]  Right, that is exactly what they're doing.
[03:27:14.976 --> 03:27:17.858]  Every time I get to a new block, there's another collapse of soldiers.
[03:27:18.678 --> 03:27:24.001]  And, um, yeah, trying to... Yeah, Burmese said that there are army there.
[03:27:24.581 --> 03:27:25.502]  Obviously, we haven't seen it.
[03:27:25.762 --> 03:27:33.386]  Have you seen the video of snatch and grab teams grabbing peaceful demonstrators and shoving them in police cars with the army driving them and driving them away?
[03:27:34.525 --> 03:27:36.186]  Um, I haven't seen any video of it.
[03:27:36.246 --> 03:27:39.949]  I've seen paddy wagons, I've seen them, you know, zoom away through the crowd.
[03:27:40.489 --> 03:27:45.973]  Like I said, I've seen the paddy wagons come in and then zoom away, but I haven't seen, you know, with my own eyes and been able to capture it on video.
[03:28:05.071 --> 03:28:07.293]  Billy Club people threaten the Billy Club people.
[03:28:08.533 --> 03:28:17.179]  Yep, well I was standing in front of the line in between the anarchists, or supposed anarchists, and the military line, and they all had rifles.
[03:28:17.239 --> 03:28:22.303]  And then for some reason, I can't figure out what it was, they just started pointing the rifles right in our face.
[03:28:22.383 --> 03:28:26.345]  I had a tear gas, you know, two inches from my face.
[03:28:27.446 --> 03:28:31.329]  You're telling me that they were pointing rifles?
[03:28:31.629 --> 03:28:33.110]  They look like shotguns?
[03:28:34.133 --> 03:28:37.214]  Yeah, you know, it looked bigger than a shotgun.
[03:28:37.915 --> 03:28:39.756]  It looked like a grenade launcher is what it looked like.
[03:28:39.776 --> 03:28:41.797]  That's probably a big tear gas launcher.
[03:28:42.337 --> 03:28:43.938]  Those can kill you up close.
[03:28:44.678 --> 03:28:45.738]  Remember the Red Sox?
[03:28:46.719 --> 03:28:51.041]  They killed some girl, walked out of a bar and they shot her at 10 feet in the eye and it pushed her eye back in her brain.
[03:28:51.441 --> 03:28:54.682]  You have video of them just for no reason aiming the weapons at you.
[03:28:55.323 --> 03:29:00.025]  You know, I don't know what I got exactly because I was right in the middle of changing tapes when that happened.
[03:29:00.740 --> 03:29:09.818]  And I slammed the tape in and I pressed record as fast as I could, but I also wet myself a little bit, so... It was pretty intense.
[03:29:10.920 --> 03:29:12.604]  Did you really wet yourself?
[03:29:13.377 --> 03:29:15.378]  No, not really.
[03:29:15.698 --> 03:29:20.781]  You know, all of a sudden they got very aggressive and started moving towards us and pointing weapons.
[03:29:21.241 --> 03:29:23.542]  And I personally have never had anything that big show.
[03:29:23.562 --> 03:29:25.243]  Well, that's what Burma said.
[03:29:25.263 --> 03:29:30.746]  He said just some woman stepped up on the sidewalk and the guy took a billy club and said, I'll smash your teeth in, whore.
[03:29:31.466 --> 03:29:33.867]  And we've seen videos of that.
[03:29:33.907 --> 03:29:34.968]  We can't play it here.
[03:29:35.228 --> 03:29:38.850]  We're playing them without audio because it's cops cussing, citizens cussing.
[03:29:39.511 --> 03:29:44.652]  People just are videotaping a cop and you see him, the cop goes, I'm about to beat the hell out of you, bitch!
[03:29:45.273 --> 03:29:48.113]  You know, it is, and he adds a few things we can't say on air.
[03:29:48.553 --> 03:29:50.874]  Stay there, final report from you, straight ahead.
[03:29:51.954 --> 03:29:54.955]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.875 --> 03:29:58.576]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.561 --> 03:30:05.564]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.805 --> 03:30:07.606]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.806 --> 03:30:16.093]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:16.334 --> 03:30:21.558]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.878 --> 03:30:23.520]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.740 --> 03:30:30.062]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:30.242 --> 03:30:41.006]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:41.307 --> 03:30:41.827]  That's right.
[03:30:42.067 --> 03:30:44.388]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[03:31:04.181 --> 03:31:07.624]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:31:07.804 --> 03:31:09.706]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:31:09.946 --> 03:31:13.028]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:31:13.349 --> 03:31:15.210]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[03:31:15.663 --> 03:31:16.103]  Let's do it!

[03:33:15.296 --> 03:33:19.708]  We got our people on the ground, Rob Dew, Jason Douglas, Jason Burmiss, they're coming back tomorrow.
[03:33:20.618 --> 03:33:25.279]  Full report for you in studio Sunday with exclusive video as well that our team has shot.
[03:33:25.839 --> 03:33:35.981]  We've never had due on these days except for when the military tried to set you guys up Wednesday night, but he was saying he was up on a rooftop while Luke Radowski was bullhorning them.
[03:33:36.221 --> 03:33:42.422]  Then they hit the crowd yesterday with the sound weapon and Luke tried to hold his ground for a while, did a great job, then everybody dispersed.
[03:33:42.822 --> 03:33:47.703]  I mean, this is like out of a science fiction dystopic novel, Douglas.
[03:33:52.395 --> 03:33:53.496]  Oh, I hear the sound weapon.
[03:33:56.859 --> 03:33:57.279]  Douglas!
[03:33:58.180 --> 03:33:58.520]  Yeah?
[03:33:59.741 --> 03:34:02.203]  Douglas, this is like something out of a science fiction movie.
[03:34:02.844 --> 03:34:04.045]  That's exactly what this is.
[03:34:04.065 --> 03:34:10.110]  I mean, uh, there was a band playing the Imperial song, the Imperial Stormtrooper song, and it was so apropos.
[03:34:11.389 --> 03:34:13.171]  Um, that's exactly what this is.
[03:34:13.211 --> 03:34:17.194]  The only thing that's not the same is that they're all in different uniforms.
[03:34:17.434 --> 03:34:22.338]  It's people from all over the country, uh, police from all over the country, and National Guard.
[03:34:22.978 --> 03:34:25.260]  But, you know, they all look like stormtroopers.
[03:34:25.740 --> 03:34:26.661]  And Border Patrol?
[03:34:27.622 --> 03:34:31.705]  And Border Patrol, Homeland Security, I mean, too many to even name.
[03:34:34.127 --> 03:34:35.668]  Well, it's incredible.
[03:34:35.948 --> 03:34:37.029]  Any closing thoughts?
[03:34:38.908 --> 03:34:41.390]  You know, I just can't believe that this is happening.
[03:34:41.410 --> 03:34:50.016]  It's like, they give us five seconds to talk, and then they push us, and then they corral us onto this bridge right now.
[03:34:51.297 --> 03:34:53.438]  I'm just not sure about the state of this country anymore.
[03:34:53.558 --> 03:35:00.143]  Was it you or Burmese that said that they had one permitted march yesterday and they wouldn't even allow them to march?
[03:35:01.043 --> 03:35:02.745]  The permitted march was on the 20th.
[03:35:04.441 --> 03:35:07.503]  And they didn't allow it to go all the way down to the convention center.
[03:35:07.563 --> 03:35:10.124]  This is the closest we've gotten to the convention center.
[03:35:10.164 --> 03:35:11.365]  I can see it right now.
[03:35:11.505 --> 03:35:12.946]  It's about a block and a half away.
[03:35:14.409 --> 03:35:20.593]  Of course there's about 6 metal fences and about 500 cubes in between us and the convention center.
[03:35:44.589 --> 03:35:47.970]  We'll put the video stream out if things continue to develop.
[03:35:48.270 --> 03:35:50.830]  Thank you so much, Jason Douglas, for the great job you're doing.
[03:35:51.150 --> 03:35:51.610]  Keep it up.
[03:35:51.670 --> 03:35:52.210]  Be careful.
[03:35:52.530 --> 03:35:54.411]  Get out of there if they start attacking everybody.
[03:35:54.931 --> 03:35:56.911]  The mission is get the video out and stay safe.
[03:35:56.931 --> 03:35:57.531]  God bless you.
[03:36:00.592 --> 03:36:01.012]  Thank you.
[03:36:01.332 --> 03:36:02.592]  Let's go to a final comment.
[03:36:02.612 --> 03:36:09.874]  We're going to Bob Chapman for the balance of the hour with more economic news on the global government announcing world tax and the end of the dollar.
[03:36:10.294 --> 03:36:11.614]  Burmese, any closing comments?
[03:36:13.166 --> 03:36:15.107]  Alex, I'm really just so in the thick of it.
[03:36:15.147 --> 03:36:16.587]  We were able to get over the bridge.
[03:36:16.647 --> 03:36:19.668]  Again, thousands of people still protesting here.
[03:36:20.428 --> 03:36:23.789]  The police presence has gotten so much larger.
[03:36:23.929 --> 03:36:25.190]  I have a couple of dogs.
[03:36:25.390 --> 03:36:27.050]  I've got them on tape going up.
[03:36:27.430 --> 03:36:29.071]  A few of them have the muzzles on.
[03:36:29.091 --> 03:36:31.051]  Some of them do not have the muzzles on.
[03:36:31.412 --> 03:36:40.114]  It really looks, with the massing right now to my left, that they are ready to move the crowd along to wherever they're trying to gather us into.
[03:36:40.134 --> 03:36:42.655]  It does not look like I am going to be able to
[03:36:43.436 --> 03:36:44.338]  We're good to go.
[03:36:53.709 --> 03:36:59.071]  Well, Jason, you know they're using those dogs like in South Africa or Nazi Germany for intimidation.
[03:36:59.091 --> 03:37:05.954]  They bring them into schools and have them snap at kids and bite at them as they did in Goose Creek, North Carolina, famously.
[03:37:07.174 --> 03:37:08.575]  Look for an exit out of there.
[03:37:08.615 --> 03:37:14.838]  Why don't you get out of the crowd before they lock down and rubber bullet and sound cannon everybody because they have a bloodlust for the American people.
[03:37:15.258 --> 03:37:17.819]  We've got, as you said, photos and videos.
[03:37:18.519 --> 03:37:20.361]  We just sent Rob to get Aaron out of bed.
[03:37:20.421 --> 03:37:21.682]  He worked too late last night.
[03:37:21.702 --> 03:37:22.623]  Aaron has it last night.
[03:37:22.663 --> 03:37:23.103]  I saw it.
[03:37:23.123 --> 03:37:25.005]  So we can try to get it at the end of the show.
[03:37:25.926 --> 03:37:34.333]  But if they're rolling around, well you said you saw this too yesterday, them just going through empty neighborhoods sound canoning, broadcasting that nobody's allowed to be on the streets.
[03:37:35.419 --> 03:37:39.522]  Well, yeah, uh, you know, they were, again, they did such a great job of dispersing people.
[03:37:39.842 --> 03:37:52.430]  There would literally be 15 or 20 people coming down the street, uh, you know, and then there'd be 10 or 15 people just down on their porches who want nothing to do with this protest, and that doesn't stop them from using the LRAD.
[03:37:52.590 --> 03:37:55.812]  It's unbelievable, it's inconceivable, yet it's true.
[03:37:57.333 --> 03:37:59.214]  It's really starting to get loud now, Alex.
[03:37:59.234 --> 03:38:00.635]  They're consolidating us big time.
[03:38:00.715 --> 03:38:01.616]  I'm sure you can hear it.
[03:38:03.678 --> 03:38:08.000]  Burmese, I'm going to keep you on hold and come back to you in five minutes as this develops, okay?
[03:38:08.801 --> 03:38:09.601]  You got it.
[03:38:09.621 --> 03:38:11.042]  Just put your phone in your pocket.
[03:38:11.822 --> 03:38:15.184]  Or, well, I don't want to hang up and lose you.
[03:38:15.244 --> 03:38:18.025]  Just keep it with you and I'll come back to you in five minutes, okay?
[03:38:18.585 --> 03:38:19.466]  Alright, sounds good.
[03:38:21.127 --> 03:38:22.148]  Well, that is crazy.
[03:38:22.428 --> 03:38:26.853]  In fact, maybe we from time to time just fade up the background while Bob Chapman's talking so people can hear this.
[03:38:27.214 --> 03:38:33.180]  Bob Chapman, you fought the communists in Europe and military intelligence in Berlin.
[03:38:34.301 --> 03:38:37.965]  We have a video that we broke a month ago that's finally made national news.
[03:38:38.025 --> 03:38:39.086]  It's all over Fox, CNN.
[03:38:40.566 --> 03:38:42.726]  In fact, cue that up with the little kids worshipping Obama.
[03:38:43.227 --> 03:38:53.109]  And they said this line about, instead of Jesus loves all the little children, they say this poem and then they sing another song about red, yellow, black and white, they are all equal in his sight.
[03:38:53.489 --> 03:38:56.209]  Well, they say they're all equal in Obama's sight and then they sing the song.
[03:38:56.689 --> 03:38:58.490]  This is directly out of North Korea.
[03:38:58.530 --> 03:39:02.831]  This is worse than Hitler, worse than Stalin, worse than Mao.
[03:39:03.171 --> 03:39:09.512]  Paul Watson's girlfriend, who was born in China, she got really freaked out when she saw this because she's a patriot.
[03:39:10.112 --> 03:39:15.774]  And she said that's what we had to do to Mal when I was a little girl, was worship him and sing songs about him.
[03:39:15.794 --> 03:39:18.175]  I mean, this is getting really sick, Bob Chapman.
[03:39:19.416 --> 03:39:30.780]  Well, I think the program is accelerating and the reason it is, is because we've accelerated and we have informed the public and more and more people are catching on.
[03:39:31.640 --> 03:39:33.701]  And so that's why they're doing what they're doing.
[03:39:33.761 --> 03:39:35.062]  I think what's going to come out of this
[03:39:36.318 --> 03:39:40.440]  Uh, G20 meeting, more than anything else, is things that they're not talking about.
[03:39:41.161 --> 03:39:47.704]  And, uh, that is, uh, setting the government, uh, and the financial system up for a fall.
[03:39:48.265 --> 03:39:50.786]  It's hard to tell what date they're gonna pick.
[03:39:50.966 --> 03:39:53.768]  It could be in three months, it could be in a year and a half.
[03:39:54.688 --> 03:39:56.409]  Uh, you know, they have their own schedule.
[03:39:56.429 --> 03:40:05.594]  Yeah, they're meeting, scheming to engineer an even bigger implosion, as they've admitted in the past, and then poses the saviors, saying, give us even more power or we'll have martial law.
[03:40:06.929 --> 03:40:14.714]  You know, if they have martial law, I don't know who's going to do it, because the lower and the middle echelons of the military all know what's going on.
[03:40:14.734 --> 03:40:16.736]  Bob, I don't know, though.
[03:40:16.776 --> 03:40:30.105]  I know a lot of them are awake, evidenced by Ron Paul getting more contributions than any other political candidate in 2008, but these cops and military seem to enjoy beating the hell out of women, especially, for no reason, and L-ratting small children.
[03:40:30.185 --> 03:40:32.647]  I mean, it seems like they want to destroy their country.
[03:40:34.153 --> 03:40:41.696]  Well, I'm sure there's always some who will, and perhaps they were chosen to do the work that they're doing because of their viciousness.
[03:40:42.116 --> 03:40:42.716]  I don't know.
[03:40:42.736 --> 03:40:53.200]  I know that the average military person does not want to go around beating people up, particularly women, and doing things which are unlawful.
[03:40:54.160 --> 03:41:00.242]  And I think we're going to get a lot of support from the military, and I think this may end up as a military coup.
[03:41:04.085 --> 03:41:08.087]  Bob, let's, and then I'm going to play this Children Worshipping Obama clip.
[03:41:08.147 --> 03:41:10.268]  I played it a month ago, but again, now it's national news.
[03:41:10.308 --> 03:41:12.089]  People are emailing saying, why aren't you covering it?
[03:41:12.209 --> 03:41:12.949]  Uh, because we broke it.
[03:41:13.309 --> 03:41:15.230]  Like, I get emails saying, why haven't you covered MYAC?
[03:41:15.370 --> 03:41:15.930]  Uh, we broke it.
[03:41:15.950 --> 03:41:25.635]  I'm not bragging, it's just that that's an example of how this radio show, pretty much more than any other outlet now, but with a lot of other great folks as well, is now driving the news.
[03:41:25.995 --> 03:41:30.277]  What we break and cover, weeks later, months later, is then covered by the mainstream media.
[03:41:30.617 --> 03:41:33.338]  That shows the power of this audience.
[03:41:35.797 --> 03:41:49.621]  It certainly does and it is a powerful audience and it's up to them to keep on doing what they're doing and getting to everybody in America and informing them who the enemy of all the people is, not some political party.
[03:41:50.061 --> 03:41:58.243]  We have to all come together and that's in every country because everybody is experiencing the same thing in countries throughout the world.
[03:41:58.964 --> 03:42:03.625]  And so we got to make this thing stick and the more people who know who the enemy is,
[03:42:04.676 --> 03:42:07.818]  The least chance that they have of being successful.
[03:42:08.779 --> 03:42:13.842]  Believe me, I do not believe that the military are going to work against the American people.
[03:42:14.989 --> 03:42:22.992]  But we saw these two-stage terror stings where the FBI cooked the bomb, the fake bombs in both cases, and found one lone nut idiot.
[03:42:23.012 --> 03:42:23.933]  It's probably informants.
[03:42:23.953 --> 03:42:24.933]  They're probably setting them up.
[03:42:25.173 --> 03:42:26.133]  We know they've done that in the past.
[03:42:26.153 --> 03:42:27.294]  Or it could just be a mental patient.
[03:42:27.714 --> 03:42:33.796]  In the case of 93, World Trade Center, where the FBI cooking the bomb, training the drivers, and ordering their informants to stand down and let it happen.
[03:42:35.457 --> 03:42:37.818]  I think if they stage terror attacks and things, though, it might help.
[03:42:40.160 --> 03:42:43.183]  Well, you're always going to find people who are pliable for that.
[03:42:43.203 --> 03:42:57.277]  I mean, when they did the tests and the surveys some 20 years ago, they found that there were 10 to 15 percent of the military who would do heinous things.
[03:42:57.897 --> 03:43:01.441]  And you're always going to find, just like we have criminals in society,
[03:43:02.558 --> 03:43:09.866]  Or, if you have 15 hired anarchists run up and throw some bottles at the cops, then the cops will go ahead and open up with rubber bullets.
[03:43:10.987 --> 03:43:12.890]  Well, I have a question about that, Alex.
[03:43:13.370 --> 03:43:17.996]  And the question is, do you believe that the anarchists, the supposed anarchists,
[03:43:18.960 --> 03:43:24.344]  Are being trained and put into the positions they are by the people who control our government?
[03:43:49.401 --> 03:44:06.617]  Are doing it and so but we don't know yet We rarely catch him right at the time, but it always comes out later In Canada people followed the police car and saw him let him out a block away And we're taking their outfits off and they had police boots on and the Royal Mounted Police had to admit it But yes, I've watched the video
[03:44:07.615 --> 03:44:16.317]  And you'll have a bunch of idiot meth-head kids who are with him, maybe one-tenth of one percent of the total crowd, a few morons because the feds go and recruit patsies, but you see it.
[03:44:16.357 --> 03:44:20.297]  These are cops and informants and state police officers that are doing this.
[03:44:20.337 --> 03:44:24.718]  And their argument is, we neutralize a dangerous crowd by creating the pretext.
[03:44:24.738 --> 03:44:28.039]  You know, it's kind of like you put out an oil well fire with a stick of dynamite.
[03:44:28.319 --> 03:44:29.679]  They say, well, we're knocking this out.
[03:44:29.719 --> 03:44:30.939]  These protests are dangerous.
[03:44:31.219 --> 03:44:32.399]  The terror threat is real.
[03:44:32.720 --> 03:44:35.360]  Men, we got to go out and stage an event to keep everybody safe.
[03:44:38.553 --> 03:44:41.456]  And there are those elements that will always do that.
[03:44:42.637 --> 03:44:46.962]  We have elements in society will always, you know, do those kind of things.
[03:44:47.642 --> 03:44:49.044]  And so we have to expect it.
[03:44:49.870 --> 03:44:59.998]  And I, you know, I've listened to you talk about this before, but I wanted to bring that fact out to put it in people's minds up front, if you hadn't mentioned it earlier, and I don't know whether you had.
[03:45:00.278 --> 03:45:00.939]  No, I don't think I have.
[03:45:00.959 --> 03:45:13.509]  The point is, we gotta know that this, the public has gotta know that this anarchist reaction that you see all over the media right now, they're not calling him terrorist anymore, they're anarchist, it's all planned that way.
[03:45:13.949 --> 03:45:15.471]  It's all propaganda.
[03:45:18.166 --> 03:45:36.981]  The police herd everybody to a certain spot, then the anarchists come out then, turn over a trash can, throw a rock, and then the anarchists always pull back, the police wait, you'll even see anarchists, and we've caught this on tape, you know, they'll do a hand signal, and then they move back and the cops open fire.
[03:45:37.961 --> 03:45:38.422]  That's right.
[03:45:39.302 --> 03:45:42.145]  So we want the public to know that, that this is all planned.
[03:45:42.805 --> 03:45:45.127]  It's planned by the power behind our government.
[03:45:46.195 --> 03:45:49.286]  Well, they want to delegitimize all these tens of thousands of peaceful people.
[03:45:49.527 --> 03:45:51.012]  They do it with a handful of scum!
[03:45:51.754 --> 03:45:52.256]  And, uh...
[03:45:53.331 --> 03:45:54.171]  It's just unbelievable.
[03:45:54.272 --> 03:45:57.113]  What would the police and the corrupt system do without the anarchist thugs?
[03:45:57.393 --> 03:46:03.336]  They would have to attack people that had done nothing, and then Hitler staged an attack on his own base to attack Poland.
[03:46:04.157 --> 03:46:05.978]  Operation Northwoods, the same deal.
[03:46:06.078 --> 03:46:07.018]  Operation Glywoods.
[03:46:07.519 --> 03:46:08.459]  Operation Ajax.
[03:46:08.519 --> 03:46:09.339]  It's declassified.
[03:46:09.620 --> 03:46:11.941]  I want to play this worship piece of Obama.
[03:46:12.201 --> 03:46:17.264]  Then I want to come back and get into a little bit on the economy, what you see happening in the next few months and the year with the G20.
[03:46:18.948 --> 03:46:20.549]  And why they're announcing their world government.
[03:46:20.589 --> 03:46:35.197]  But here is one of many videos, the kids are wearing uniforms in some videos, chanting, city year in military outfits, red and black uniforms, climate cops, Boy Scouts trained to spy on their parents in a quote, take on disgruntled veterans, New York Times, it's all happening.
[03:46:35.538 --> 03:46:40.080]  But here are the children literally worshipping Obama like we're North Korea.
[03:46:50.511 --> 03:46:52.511]  We're good to go.
[03:47:28.628 --> 03:47:29.289]  Did you hear that?
[03:47:29.349 --> 03:47:29.869]  Hit pause.
[03:47:30.309 --> 03:47:31.330]  Did you hear that quote?
[03:47:32.225 --> 03:47:39.512]  From Jesus Loves All the Little Children, then they do Battle Hymn of the Republic, but then now it's Obama comes marching on.
[03:47:39.572 --> 03:47:48.079]  See, when Obama said he wants to start speaking to the kids on telescreens, on big TV screens, the original curriculum said to teach them to serve him and work with him.
[03:47:48.420 --> 03:47:50.842]  Then he backed off and said, oh, it'll just be an anti-drug speech.
[03:47:51.282 --> 03:47:53.845]  This is the Sovietization of America, Bob Chapman.
[03:47:54.866 --> 03:47:55.586]  Absolutely.
[03:47:55.606 --> 03:47:58.569]  It's mind-boggling and it's mind-washing.
[03:48:01.554 --> 03:48:04.037]  What do we do about this?
[03:48:04.277 --> 03:48:05.879]  All we can do is expose it.
[03:48:07.881 --> 03:48:09.162]  Congress won't do anything.
[03:48:09.782 --> 03:48:11.144]  The Senate won't do anything.
[03:48:11.965 --> 03:48:16.469]  And we'll have to do the best we can until the die is cast.
[03:48:16.529 --> 03:48:19.112]  And when that happens, the whole thing is going to blow sky high.
[03:48:19.132 --> 03:48:21.434]  And it won't only be in America.
[03:48:21.454 --> 03:48:23.256]  It's going to happen all over the world.
[03:48:24.161 --> 03:48:25.942]  Well, I mean, this is classical tyranny.
[03:48:26.062 --> 03:48:36.149]  They're hitting on all cylinders, secret police, militarized police, saying you can't march or demonstrate, attacking people, provocateurs, open world government, foreign banks looting us.
[03:48:37.430 --> 03:48:42.174]  Bob Chapman, I mean, there are openly 8,000 plus articles today in Google News.
[03:48:42.274 --> 03:48:49.479]  Today, 8,000 newspapers are reporting world government is here and how wonderful it is, and that Obama is now president of the planet.
[03:48:51.656 --> 03:49:01.921]  And that will continue because they own the media and we're fighting them from the other side and it's not going to stop.
[03:49:02.241 --> 03:49:04.482]  And you know, it's just like with the financial thing.
[03:49:04.902 --> 03:49:07.183]  We don't know when they're going to pull the plug, but they're going to pull it.
[03:49:07.484 --> 03:49:12.186]  We also know that they're going to use biological warfare
[03:49:13.044 --> 03:49:18.048]  That's right, it's a perfect soft kill operation to make everybody stand down.
[03:49:18.068 --> 03:49:25.734]  For the police and military that don't know what the new order means for them, they are always the most preyed upon group once the takeover has happened.
[03:49:38.211 --> 03:49:45.856]  Well, just to go back to what Henry Kissinger said, generally paraphrasing him, they're dumb animals, you know?
[03:49:46.577 --> 03:49:47.977]  They're cannon fodder.
[03:49:49.358 --> 03:49:51.980]  Yeah, he said military men are dumb animals and published it!
[03:49:53.741 --> 03:49:56.583]  Well, I just showed you the disdain and arrogance that they have.
[03:49:58.064 --> 03:49:59.765]  You know, let me tell you something.
[03:50:00.165 --> 03:50:03.468]  No matter what happens to people, they're not going to make it.
[03:50:04.328 --> 03:50:06.730]  The people behind the scenes who are causing this.
[03:50:07.455 --> 03:50:13.819]  It's just that we're going to pay a terrible price as humanity because we wouldn't listen, generally speaking.
[03:50:14.819 --> 03:50:15.980]  And, uh, they're going to lose.
[03:50:17.201 --> 03:50:24.565]  Because people will, there are certain people, and all we need is five to ten percent of the population, who refuse to live on their knees.
[03:50:26.766 --> 03:50:30.268]  We're going to go out with a battle hymn of the republic with the children worshipping Obama.
[03:50:31.009 --> 03:50:34.311]  With his name in place of the republic, we'll come back with Bob Chapman on the economy.
[03:51:01.997 --> 03:51:04.918]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:51:05.378 --> 03:51:07.579]  If so, this is going to be the most important
[03:51:10.247 --> 03:51:10.667]  We're good to go.
[03:51:31.544 --> 03:51:31.824]  I think so.
[03:52:02.276 --> 03:52:07.603]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.323 --> 03:52:13.650]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.210 --> 03:52:20.358]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.678 --> 03:52:22.519]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.659 --> 03:52:25.041]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.121 --> 03:52:36.089]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:38.310 --> 03:52:39.611]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.991 --> 03:52:41.372]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.853 --> 03:52:48.077]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:54:12.072 --> 03:54:16.215]  Don't nobody know my troubles with God.
[03:54:16.495 --> 03:54:20.196]  Don't nobody know my troubles with God.
[03:54:22.418 --> 03:54:31.024]  It's the G20 World Government being announced.
[03:54:31.084 --> 03:54:32.725]  I'll be live Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:54:32.806 --> 03:54:35.027]  Please tell your friends, your family, your neighbors about the show.

[03:54:47.336 --> 03:54:47.796]  I don't know.
[03:55:17.850 --> 03:55:19.811]  Bob Chapman, in closing, the economy.
[03:55:21.191 --> 03:55:22.071]  Things aren't going well.
[03:55:22.091 --> 03:55:24.672]  They're starting to drop their takeover of health care.
[03:55:25.413 --> 03:55:27.193]  Their entire agenda is stalling.
[03:55:27.213 --> 03:55:29.514]  Do you think they're going to stage terror attacks?
[03:55:29.634 --> 03:55:31.335]  What is the establishment going to do?
[03:55:31.615 --> 03:55:33.135]  And what do you see happening in the economy?
[03:55:34.256 --> 03:55:45.760]  Well, they have the problems that you just mentioned, cap and trade as well, which they're pushing very hard now with the President's speech as well as Clinton getting up there and running around on his hind legs.
[03:55:47.631 --> 03:55:55.899]  Next, we've got the turmoil that's going to occur during the month of October from this swine flu situation.
[03:55:55.939 --> 03:55:57.000]  I hope you got my email.
[03:55:57.861 --> 03:56:03.987]  And also, we're going to have the dollar down at around $71.18 in the USDX.
[03:56:04.508 --> 03:56:05.369]  It's currently around $77.
[03:56:07.419 --> 03:56:23.213]  And what's going to happen is that they're going to tell you, and they are in the process of doing so, that they're going to start removing all of this money and credit that they have injected into the system.
[03:56:23.693 --> 03:56:28.037]  And that cannot happen without the entire economy collapsing.
[03:56:28.715 --> 03:56:32.396]  And so I don't think they're ready yet to go for it.
[03:56:32.456 --> 03:56:35.477]  It's going to happen, and probably in the next year and a half.
[03:56:36.037 --> 03:56:37.717]  I don't know when, but I don't think they're quite ready.
[03:56:37.737 --> 03:56:42.238]  So it's kind of like the hesitation at the edge of a 200-foot cliff about to jump into the water.
[03:56:42.418 --> 03:56:46.819]  They're kind of hesitating, getting everybody ready, sending up trial balloons.
[03:56:46.899 --> 03:56:49.900]  Tell people what it will look like if the dollar is dumped.
[03:56:51.981 --> 03:56:54.221]  Uh, there will be an official devaluation.
[03:56:55.062 --> 03:56:57.642]  Uh, probably one new one for three old ones.
[03:56:58.462 --> 03:57:00.343]  Uh, there will be a default on debt.
[03:57:00.983 --> 03:57:09.464]  Uh, that will be coordinated entirely by a meeting, such as the Smithsonian, and then later in the 80s, the, uh, Plaza Accords.
[03:57:10.124 --> 03:57:19.826]  And they will revalue and devalue all currencies against one another, and they will probably chop off two-thirds of the debt, and the debtors will pay back one-third.
[03:57:20.266 --> 03:57:24.931]  How that will affect individuals within individual economies, I don't know.
[03:57:24.991 --> 03:57:34.380]  I know what the logical thing to do is, but goodness knows they may not use the logical thing, which is to reduce debt by the same amount domestically.
[03:57:35.581 --> 03:57:39.685]  And that's what we got coming as far as money and credit is concerned.
[03:57:39.985 --> 03:57:41.086]  How do you protect yourself?
[03:57:41.487 --> 03:57:42.548]  You gotta be in gold.
[03:57:42.608 --> 03:57:43.669]  It's the only place.
[03:57:43.749 --> 03:57:44.570]  Gold and silver.
[03:57:45.598 --> 03:57:47.919]  But what you said is key for laymen that don't understand.
[03:57:48.380 --> 03:57:53.162]  Institutions and big globalist groups are going to have their debt forgiven and a devaluation of currency.
[03:57:53.422 --> 03:58:02.307]  But they're probably going to keep all the maximum debts on us, keep increasing taxes, and just Billy Club it out of us like the Sheriff of Nottingham in the days of Robin Hood.
[03:58:03.688 --> 03:58:04.408]  Absolutely.
[03:58:04.448 --> 03:58:05.789]  That's probably the way they'll go.
[03:58:07.449 --> 03:58:12.535]  And the people are in for it, and the police are being brainwashed like attack dogs against us right now.
[03:58:12.595 --> 03:58:18.723]  TheInternationalForecaster.com will link to this big breaking news at PrisonPlanet.com on the flu that Bob was just telling you about.
[03:58:19.063 --> 03:58:21.126]  Bob Chapman, thank you so much for joining us.
[03:58:21.706 --> 03:58:24.610]  Thank you for having me, and thank everybody for listening.
[03:58:25.190 --> 03:58:25.511]  You bet.

[03:58:32.699 --> 03:58:35.062]  It's going up in the next hour at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:35.082 --> 03:58:36.483]  FalloftheRepublic.com.
[03:58:36.503 --> 03:58:37.544]  See you back live this Sunday.
[03:58:37.584 --> 03:58:41.669]  Retransmission with Dave Mustaine and a lot more coming up right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:41.749 --> 03:58:46.794]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[03:58:51.600 --> 03:58:54.522]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.982 --> 03:58:58.145]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.605 --> 03:59:02.949]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:03.189 --> 03:59:04.590]  These emergency backup systems
[03:59:04.830 --> 03:59:07.312]  Provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[03:59:07.732 --> 03:59:13.555]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.835 --> 03:59:16.877]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:17.458 --> 03:59:21.860]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:22.281 --> 03:59:28.584]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.845 --> 03:59:30.786]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:59:31.266 --> 03:59:32.247]  Coast to coast and in your face!
[03:59:32.267 --> 03:59:34.928]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
