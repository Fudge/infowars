[00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.048]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:06.408 --> 00:00:08.692]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:32.197]  Years ago, I interviewed Mr. Black several times, law professor, corporate fraud investigator, one of the top investigators that went after the Keating crooks and others, the SNLs, and they got memos where they were talking about, we want him dead and things like that.
[00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:39.090]  Now the Ponzi schemes are even larger and more dangerous and he has a lot of courage to be doing what he's doing.
[00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:55.402]  But I wanted to play a little clip from Bill Moyers because to see this on national television, not just on our local TV show or on a syndicated radio, I mean that's big to have Mr. Black on with us now talking about this, but to have it on Bill Moyers caused a huge buzz and people really started realizing what we were facing.
[00:00:55.642 --> 00:00:56.403]  Here's a quick clip.
[00:00:57.364 --> 00:01:05.110]  ...than Bill Black, the former director of the Institute for Fraud Prevention, now teaches economics and law at the University of Missouri, Kansas City.
[00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:11.736]  During the savings and loan crisis, it was Black who accused then House Speaker Jim Wright and five U.S.
[00:01:11.776 --> 00:01:19.302]  Senators, including John Glenn and John McCain, of doing favors for the SNLs in exchange for contributions and other perks.
[00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:33.596]  The Senators got off with a slap on the wrist, but so enraged was one of those bankers, Charles Keating, after whom the Senate's so-called Keating Five were named, he sent a memo that read in part, get black, kill him dead.
[00:01:34.196 --> 00:01:35.277]  Metaphorically, of course.
[00:01:35.978 --> 00:01:36.338]  Of course.
[00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:44.820]  Now he's focused on an even greater scandal, and he spares no one, not even the president he worked hard to elect, Barack Obama.
[00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:59.763]  But his main target are the Wall Street barons who are heirs of an earlier generation whose scandalous rip-offs of wealth back in the 1930s earned them comparison to Al Capone and the mob, and the nickname, Banksters.
[00:02:00.243 --> 00:02:01.784]  Bill Black, welcome to the Journal.
[00:02:02.064 --> 00:02:02.344]  Thank you.
[00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:08.352]  I was taken with your candor at the conference here in New York to hear you say... Yes, we were taken with it as well.
[00:02:08.432 --> 00:02:15.202]  ...that this economic and financial meltdown... We were taken with it as well, and that's why we're going to go to Mr. Black right now.
[00:02:15.783 --> 00:02:17.145]  Mr. Black, good to have you on with us.
[00:02:17.726 --> 00:02:17.986]  Thank you.
[00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:27.719]  Okay, you've got the floor for the rest of the hour and I don't want to take much more time than that because I want you to be able to complete the interview that you've been gracious enough to do with us there in your offices.
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.164]  But my big issue that I'd like you to speak about first is
[00:02:34.145 --> 00:02:48.533]  The same crew, the same ideas have built Ponzi schemes many orders larger and instead of even getting in trouble, they're being seen as our saviors and offering even bigger Ponzi schemes as their solution.
[00:02:49.113 --> 00:02:52.095]  So, is this leading us to rack and ruin?
[00:02:53.816 --> 00:02:56.117]  It has already led us to there.
[00:02:56.737 --> 00:03:03.361]  But you're right, unless we remove this ideology and these folks from power,
[00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:08.498]  They will produce recurrent, intensifying crises.
[00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:14.399]  In layman's terms, what are we currently facing?
[00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.239]  Who's guilty?
[00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:16.419]  How do we stop it?
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:30.182]  Well, in layman's terms, the FBI began publicly warning in September 2004 that there was an epidemic, their word, of mortgage fraud.
[00:03:31.232 --> 00:03:39.518]  And they said, if this epidemic is not stopped, it will produce an economic crisis at least as large as the savings and loan debacle.
[00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:48.605]  And then they said, but of course, we've learned the lessons from the savings and loan debacle, and we'll be all over this one, so it won't cause those problems.
[00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:51.407]  Well, you know, they were right about the first two things.
[00:03:52.288 --> 00:03:55.430]  Obviously, they weren't even close to right about the third.
[00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.753]  The FBI has said something else immensely important.
[00:04:00.137 --> 00:04:05.602]  And that is that 80% of the mortgage fraud is induced by the lenders.
[00:04:07.583 --> 00:04:13.888]  So think about that in terms of, you know, taxpayer revolts and things like that.
[00:04:13.908 --> 00:04:27.900]  You shouldn't be focusing on the individual borrowers as much, at least, as you should be focusing on the big CEOs of these specialty places that, as you said, ran Ponzi schemes.
[00:04:28.742 --> 00:04:33.725]  In order to get extraordinarily rich through their bonus compensation systems.
[00:04:34.505 --> 00:04:44.250]  And then, you know, in many cases walk away, and in other cases remain there, still in control, and being subsidized by all of us as taxpayers right now.
[00:04:46.692 --> 00:04:54.936]  Now, you know, you talk about this being engineered fraud, or the term you use is this control fraud.
[00:04:57.734 --> 00:05:01.796]  Break that down, and then let's get specifically into the fraud we're witnessing right now.
[00:05:02.356 --> 00:05:03.457]  Sure.
[00:05:03.497 --> 00:05:09.960]  Control fraud is simply a term for what happens when you have a seemingly legitimate organization.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:20.765]  In other words, as opposed to an obvious mob shop type of thing, where the person who controls it uses it as a weapon to defraud others.
[00:05:21.825 --> 00:05:25.227]  And if the CEO is the crook, he can
[00:05:26.502 --> 00:05:29.224]  Take care of all the internal controls.
[00:05:29.524 --> 00:05:31.746]  He can get rid of all the underwriting.
[00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:35.228]  And you don't defeat internal controls.
[00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:37.230]  You actually suborn them.
[00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.771]  You turn them into allies.
[00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:50.639]  And so these folks were able to get clean audit opinions from the most elite accounting institutions in the world, even though the places were massively insolvent.
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.323]  They were, of course, able to get grossly inflated appraisals.
[00:05:55.993 --> 00:06:12.621]  from top appraisers, and they were able to get AAA, that's pristine, that's supposed to mean zero credit risk, AAA ratings from the top three rating companies in the world for stuff that was known in the trade as toxic waste.
[00:06:14.622 --> 00:06:22.186]  And that allowed them to sell trillions of dollars, well over two trillion dollars
[00:06:25.178 --> 00:06:52.828]  Now this has been described as a Ponzi scheme too big to fail and it's now a black hole and that the industry that engineered this understands that they can hold the population hostage and say just do whatever we say or we'll have a depression and then when we end up in a depression anyways from their activities they're going to be sitting there with all the assets.
[00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:56.230]  Well, I call it the suicide strategy.
[00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:01.972]  I don't know if people have seen Blazing Saddles, but the sheriff is surrounded by hostile town folks.
[00:07:02.012 --> 00:07:06.935]  He takes out his gun, points it at his own head and says, you know, don't move or I'll shoot.
[00:07:07.855 --> 00:07:10.056]  And that's essentially what these big banks are doing.
[00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:15.658]  They're saying, you know, give us unlimited amounts of money or we'll fail.
[00:07:15.858 --> 00:07:19.260]  And if we fail, we'll take down the entire economy with you.
[00:07:20.003 --> 00:07:23.188]  Why we would believe any of these people is beyond me.
[00:07:23.228 --> 00:07:32.121]  Why we would leave in charge people that are willing to make that kind of obscene extortion is absolutely beyond me.
[00:07:34.448 --> 00:07:44.090]  Now, specifically, from your experience, tell the listeners a little bit about who you've investigated in the past, what you've dealt with, and you're one of the leading experts, really, in the world on going after these types of frauds.
[00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:49.651]  But the difference here is, the media's not saying the Keating Five are bad, or the regulators were bad that let it happen.
[00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:51.811]  Instead, they're saying these are our saviors.
[00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:57.352]  So, is this new territory where they're just a blank check to do whatever they want?
[00:07:58.053 --> 00:08:00.073]  Now, the terrible shame about this
[00:08:01.382 --> 00:08:05.344]  This isn't simply a case of failing to learn from mistakes in the past.
[00:08:05.824 --> 00:08:08.505]  We've forgotten successes in the past.
[00:08:09.065 --> 00:08:12.987]  So during the savings and loan debacle, for example, we actually looked.
[00:08:13.407 --> 00:08:15.247]  God forbid, that would be a nice idea, wouldn't it?
[00:08:15.888 --> 00:08:17.608]  Look at what was causing the problem.
[00:08:18.209 --> 00:08:19.349]  We had a national commission.
[00:08:19.409 --> 00:08:21.410]  I was the deputy staff director on that.
[00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:30.093]  It concluded, after looking at all the major failures, that at the typical large failure, fraud was, their words,
[00:08:30.578 --> 00:08:32.199]  Invariably present.
[00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.440]  And they meant fraud from the CEO ranks.
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:36.300]  Right?
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.481]  So there we knew what was going on.
[00:08:40.561 --> 00:08:43.482]  We knew the pattern that these frauds followed.
[00:08:43.602 --> 00:08:46.844]  And it's very similar to the existing one.
[00:08:47.244 --> 00:08:48.824]  You gut your underwriting.
[00:08:49.444 --> 00:08:51.485]  You pervert your internal controls.
[00:08:52.085 --> 00:08:53.846]  You grow massively.
[00:08:54.206 --> 00:08:56.667]  And you make the worst possible loans.
[00:08:57.107 --> 00:09:00.028]  Because you can grow a lot faster by making bad loans.
[00:09:00.467 --> 00:09:08.273]  And trying to compete for good loans and because bad loans pay more in the short term in terms of higher interest rates and fees.
[00:09:08.893 --> 00:09:16.919]  And you make a ton of money as an absolute mathematical guarantee when you do that during the expansion phase of the bubble.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.423]  And then, of course, it's also guaranteed that you'll produce a catastrophe.
[00:09:22.503 --> 00:09:28.307]  So I was at the staff level, the person leading the re-regulation.
[00:09:28.988 --> 00:09:30.529]  of the savings and loan industry.
[00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:35.811]  As a litigation director, I was suing the crooks.
[00:09:35.871 --> 00:09:46.495]  And as I said, unlike this crisis, we went after places like Lincoln Savings when they were still reporting they were the most profitable savings and loans in the country.
[00:09:47.135 --> 00:09:50.956]  We said, no, you're frauds, and went about trying to put them out of business.
[00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:57.619]  In the current crisis, the FBI did not even begin to investigate
[00:09:58.328 --> 00:09:59.029]  The big lenders.
[00:09:59.089 --> 00:10:02.951]  And remember, 80% of the fraud, according to the FBI, comes from the lenders.
[00:10:03.432 --> 00:10:14.679]  The FBI doesn't even begin to investigate them until March of 2007, when the entire secondary market in toxic waste shuts down.
[00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:24.806]  And of course, it's now two years later, and there is not a single significant indictment of any of these specialty frauds.
[00:10:25.687 --> 00:10:27.468]  And a whole chunk of these folks
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.722]  What they sold was known in the trade as liar's loans.
[00:10:33.243 --> 00:10:42.288]  Now how hard is it, as a prosecutor, as a regulator, to figure out that if the trade calls something a fraud, it's probably a fraud?
[00:10:45.831 --> 00:10:46.271]  Amazing.
[00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:47.791]  They even label it a fraud.
[00:10:48.051 --> 00:10:49.552]  I mean, look at Madoff.
[00:10:49.892 --> 00:11:04.035]  How, for nine years, was he telling the SEC this was going on, and then when the SEC is asked about it, they say, oh, he's not guilty, or he hasn't pled guilty yet when he already had, and then they arrogantly, you know, declare executive privilege?
[00:11:05.295 --> 00:11:07.556]  Well, the SEC has been emasculated.
[00:11:08.936 --> 00:11:11.076]  It is utterly non-functional.
[00:11:11.936 --> 00:11:14.437]  What we now know, finally,
[00:11:14.781 --> 00:11:20.926]  Because finally, Congress started to hold some hearings last year into the rating agencies.
[00:11:21.647 --> 00:11:24.889]  And we learned the following things about the rating agencies.
[00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.072]  And the rating agencies were absolutely critical.
[00:11:28.112 --> 00:11:31.675]  If you don't get a AAA rating, you can't sell this toxic waste.
[00:11:31.695 --> 00:11:33.036]  All right, stay there, sir.
[00:11:33.056 --> 00:11:33.496]  We got a break.
[00:11:33.536 --> 00:11:33.976]  Quick break.
[00:11:34.437 --> 00:11:37.099]  Come back with our guest, William K. Black.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.760]  He is a
[00:11:40.137 --> 00:11:53.627]  Associate Professor of Economics and Law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law and one of the head honchos that went after the SNL barons successfully during the 1980s.
[00:11:54.147 --> 00:11:59.311]  But now they're back with a vengeance and swallowing the whole world in a black hole of debt.
[00:12:01.854 --> 00:12:02.314]  We're good to go.
[00:12:19.441 --> 00:12:25.706]  Pepperspray.com is the only website you'll ever need for all of your non-lethal self-defense supplies.

[00:13:01.437 --> 00:13:05.099]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:13:05.499 --> 00:13:10.923]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:13:11.383 --> 00:13:12.463]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:13:12.483 --> 00:13:16.566]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:13:17.206 --> 00:13:30.434]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:13:30.994 --> 00:13:36.316]  For this reason Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:13:36.596 --> 00:13:42.557]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[00:13:44.738 --> 00:13:49.279]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:13:49.699 --> 00:13:50.300]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.520]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:52.600]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:01.394 --> 00:14:06.721]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:14.251]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:14:14.793 --> 00:14:20.999]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:14:21.379 --> 00:14:23.221]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:14:23.361 --> 00:14:25.763]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:14:25.844 --> 00:14:36.814]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:38.719]  It's not about left or right.
[00:14:39.079 --> 00:14:40.480]  It's about a one world government.
[00:14:40.941 --> 00:14:47.306]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:14:47.866 --> 00:14:55.652]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:14:56.133 --> 00:14:57.274]  The Obama Deception.
[00:14:57.694 --> 00:14:58.895]  The people strike back.
[00:15:01.135 --> 00:15:01.995]  Spring is here.
[00:15:02.255 --> 00:15:03.036]  Growing season.
[00:15:03.216 --> 00:15:05.196]  The economy is not getting any better.
[00:15:05.416 --> 00:15:06.817]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[00:15:07.117 --> 00:15:07.797]  Think about it.
[00:15:08.097 --> 00:15:11.958]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[00:15:12.198 --> 00:15:15.679]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.

[00:15:57.558 --> 00:15:59.759]  OrganicaSeed.com today.
[00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:06.400]  Alright, William K. Black is our guest.
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.280]  We're gonna go right back to him.
[00:16:08.981 --> 00:16:10.561]  Mr. Black boiling it all down.
[00:16:11.766 --> 00:16:15.308]  But in your own words, both parties are bought and paid for by Wall Street.
[00:16:15.628 --> 00:16:18.210]  Obama got, what, four times Wall Street money McCain did.
[00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.292]  I'm not saying I was pushing McCain either.
[00:16:21.312 --> 00:16:34.641]  Obama's claiming he's fighting Wall Street when his whole administration, it seems, is filled with the very people that got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act and allowed this to happen from the 1990s.
[00:16:34.701 --> 00:16:37.082]  And, of course, the Bush people are willing accomplices as well.
[00:16:37.423 --> 00:16:39.164]  I mean, can you speak specifically to that?
[00:16:39.184 --> 00:16:40.585]  Oh, sure.
[00:16:42.091 --> 00:16:59.380]  Clearly, the Rubin-Sommers-Geithner wing of economic advice in the Obama administration is very, very similar to Paulson's views.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:06.544]  In other words, there really is not much of a difference at all between the two administrations
[00:17:07.051 --> 00:17:15.073]  In their view, there was broad bipartisan support for getting rid of the Glass-Steagall Law, for example.
[00:17:15.113 --> 00:17:26.976]  There was broad bipartisan support for destroying Brooksley Bourne's effort to regulate credit default swaps, which are the things that blew up AIG.
[00:17:27.576 --> 00:17:35.318]  And at AIG, the taxpayers have already lost more money than the entire savings and loan cost, debacle cost.
[00:17:35.902 --> 00:17:38.243]  And by the way, you know, AIG, we weren't on the hook.
[00:17:38.843 --> 00:17:41.284]  It's not a federally insured depository.
[00:17:41.864 --> 00:17:45.285]  That was gratuitous giveaway of taxpayer money.
[00:17:45.585 --> 00:17:57.950]  So this is a new level of Ponzi schemes, where they make hundreds of billions and trillions on the way up, and now, with the bailouts on their Ponzi scheme, they get even more money on the other side of it with the taxpayer on the hook.
[00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.070]  Well, this will only encourage more fraud.
[00:18:00.651 --> 00:18:03.071]  That's exactly what we're trying to get across.
[00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:04.712]  You do this type of thing,
[00:18:05.222 --> 00:18:25.550]  You encourage businesses to be even more abusive going forward, because they can do the most outrageous things, get incredibly wealthy through the bonuses doing them, and even when they cause disaster, they get new bonuses and more compensation paid by the taxpayers.
[00:18:26.251 --> 00:18:30.792]  It is a system, you know, the movie The Gods Must Be Crazy.
[00:18:31.873 --> 00:18:34.394]  It's got to be the theme for both administrations.
[00:18:35.003 --> 00:18:37.163]  Because it is utterly insane policy.
[00:18:37.463 --> 00:18:39.144]  But isn't it crazy like a fox?
[00:18:39.204 --> 00:18:54.987]  I mean, they make money on building up the Pyramid Ponzi scheme, and then now, because they're in total control of both parties in the executive, legislative, judicial, to a certain extent, and they control the military and the police, and they control the media, and so it's crazy like a fox!
[00:18:55.047 --> 00:18:56.447]  I mean, they're making out like bandits!
[00:18:56.907 --> 00:18:59.528]  Oh, I don't say it's crazy from a banker's perspective.
[00:18:59.568 --> 00:19:01.928]  It's perfectly sensible from a banker's perspective.
[00:19:02.548 --> 00:19:13.517]  But from any politician's perspective, yeah, we can understand how much they get in the way of campaign contributions, but this is a superb way to get thrown out of office.
[00:19:14.478 --> 00:19:21.663]  It's a superb way to have your reputation destroyed and to have your integrity besmirched.
[00:19:22.083 --> 00:19:29.009]  Is it not a superb way, Professor Black, to also cause a Weimar Republic type situation?
[00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:58.180]  Well, I think that we'll stop short of Weimar this time, certainly, but if you keep this up, you will take, you know, by far the top nation in the world in a whole host of dimensions, and you will reduce it to another case of crony capitalism, where you have utter socialism for the rich, in the sense of the failed bankers, paid for by all of us.
[00:19:59.021 --> 00:19:59.581]  And that will be a
[00:20:00.307 --> 00:20:00.868]  Very good.
[00:20:14.198 --> 00:20:15.419]  Wow, that is just amazing.
[00:20:15.439 --> 00:20:20.463]  You know, I try to explain that to people and they're like, it's liberal, it's conservative, it's socialism, it's fascism.
[00:20:20.783 --> 00:20:28.669]  And I'm like, no, this is corrupt pirates running inside scams, bankrupting everything, and then having the people pay for it.
[00:20:29.009 --> 00:20:34.453]  When Newsweek comes out and says we're all socialists now, isn't this, this is the opposite of socialism.
[00:20:34.473 --> 00:20:37.376]  This isn't them helicoptering money down on the people.
[00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:39.978]  This is helicoptering money to the offshore banks.
[00:20:40.612 --> 00:20:44.774]  Yeah, I mean, if you wanted precedent to be closest to National Socialism.
[00:20:47.315 --> 00:20:50.617]  I guess where they call it socialism, but really just give it all to the inner party?
[00:20:50.637 --> 00:20:53.218]  Yeah, it's a fascist arrangement.
[00:20:54.279 --> 00:20:55.619]  And then they call it socialist.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.321]  Right, well, you know, the Nazi Party calls itself National Socialist.
[00:20:59.381 --> 00:21:01.802]  I'm not comparing either of these to Nazis.
[00:21:01.842 --> 00:21:07.305]  I don't think that's, you know, that misuse of the phrase strikes me as
[00:21:08.345 --> 00:21:10.668]  Really diminishing what Nazis were all about.
[00:21:10.688 --> 00:21:12.350]  But the economic system is similar.
[00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:17.876]  But the economic system is... I think the best way to describe it is crony capitalism.
[00:21:18.156 --> 00:21:18.336]  Yeah.
[00:21:18.617 --> 00:21:20.599]  And that's a terrible system.
[00:21:20.699 --> 00:21:25.805]  Anybody who's ever lived in a nation like that doesn't want to be there.
[00:21:25.825 --> 00:21:26.185]  Okay.
[00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:27.807]  It's like, of course, there's the crony capitalism.
[00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:29.531]  Okay, exactly.
[00:21:29.571 --> 00:21:30.651]  It's good for them, nobody else.
[00:21:31.052 --> 00:21:36.095]  Let's come back and talk about who's at fault, how we bring them to justice, so that we can stop them.
[00:21:36.115 --> 00:21:38.296]  Because they control the political system now.
[00:21:38.356 --> 00:21:44.460]  If we don't stop them somehow, as you said, it's going to lead to Weimar Republic or, I guess, Zimbabwe.
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:48.062]  His book is The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One.
[00:21:48.102 --> 00:21:49.122]  You gotta read it, folks.
[00:21:49.623 --> 00:21:51.184]  We really appreciate William K. Black.
[00:21:51.344 --> 00:21:52.224]  We're on the march.
[00:21:52.725 --> 00:21:54.326]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:55.266 --> 00:21:57.948]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:01.138 --> 00:22:05.960]  The new Multipolar Inline and Portable Water System, new from HempUSA.org.
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:14.583]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source, rendering chemicals harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[00:22:14.783 --> 00:22:19.485]  Imagine a softer, smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system and brain.
[00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:26.607]  There are no filters to buy, and it can be taken anywhere, making it our number one new product from HempUSA.org.
[00:22:26.787 --> 00:22:29.228]  This water system will descale all piping,
[00:22:29.448 --> 00:22:29.728]  I think so.
[00:22:49.082 --> 00:22:52.644]  There are multiple sizes also available for farms and commercial use.
[00:22:52.864 --> 00:22:55.045]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[00:22:55.065 --> 00:22:55.385]  That's 908-691-2608.
[00:22:55.405 --> 00:22:59.187]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:07.532 --> 00:23:12.896]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:23:13.417 --> 00:23:19.621]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:23:19.921 --> 00:23:21.723]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:23:21.883 --> 00:23:24.285]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:23:24.345 --> 00:23:35.233]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:23:37.518 --> 00:23:38.799]  It's not about left or right.
[00:23:39.199 --> 00:23:40.599]  It's about a one world government.
[00:23:41.059 --> 00:23:47.382]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:25:11.215 --> 00:25:19.538]  Okay, in the limited time we have with William K. Black, top federal investigator of the SNLs, the Keating Five, helped send some of them to jail.
[00:25:21.118 --> 00:25:24.539]  And they got memos out from Keating saying, we want to kill this guy, kill him dead.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.080]  Clearly, very, very scary people.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:36.703]  And a lot of folks ended up dying mysterious deaths, not just here, but in Australia, and BCCI, and Clark Clifford, and that whole CIA front.
[00:25:37.504 --> 00:25:38.084]  Mr. Black,
[00:25:39.758 --> 00:25:48.022]  Continuing here, I want to go back briefly and then get into who's culpable, what Geithner's up to, you know, how we stop him, because there's this key nexus point.
[00:25:48.342 --> 00:26:02.870]  As you point out, when you got Paulson, you got Geithner, it now comes out that even, you know, before Obama was elected and after he was elected, they were already working with Geithner on writing up the bailout, the banker takeover, when he was head of the New York Fed.
[00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:06.312]  And you've got the Chief of Staff, Emanuel from Wall Street,
[00:26:07.092 --> 00:26:19.976]  I mean, literally, it's this tight coterie, this group of people in there working together, Republicans and Democrats, like I've never seen before in modern history.
[00:26:20.476 --> 00:26:23.357]  But a lot of people email me and say, oh, don't bash Obama.
[00:26:24.017 --> 00:26:25.418]  This was Bush that did all this.
[00:26:25.438 --> 00:26:28.799]  And I'm like, yeah, Bush did it, and now Obama's going along with it.
[00:26:28.819 --> 00:26:34.861]  So can you break down what happened with the banker bailout from your own research?
[00:26:34.881 --> 00:26:35.721]  Is that bipartisan?
[00:26:37.912 --> 00:26:43.355]  The banker bailout is fairly bipartisan.
[00:26:44.075 --> 00:27:03.464]  It's wrong, not even so much, frankly, because of politics directly, as because of very, very poor creation of the plan, originally by Secretary Paulson, and then eventually with the assistance of Geithner when he was still president.
[00:27:03.914 --> 00:27:05.595]  of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
[00:27:05.955 --> 00:27:09.037]  This really wasn't compelled on them by the politicians.
[00:27:09.498 --> 00:27:12.259]  This is more, they are so tight with the industry.
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:26.488]  Paulson in particular, after all, is the guy who came from Goldman Sachs, had run Goldman Sachs before he became Treasury Secretary, had gotten Goldman Sachs into toxic waste.
[00:27:26.889 --> 00:27:30.651]  He's the guy that got them into trouble with toxic waste.
[00:27:31.311 --> 00:27:32.152]  Then he comes out
[00:27:33.387 --> 00:27:35.508]  And AIG is in trouble.
[00:27:36.088 --> 00:27:51.451]  He appoints a group to give him advice and he puts Goldman Sachs, his own firm, on the advisory panel when it has a massive conflict of interest because AIG owes it billions and billions of dollars.
[00:27:52.251 --> 00:27:52.891]  And guess what?
[00:27:52.991 --> 00:27:53.691]  They advise.
[00:27:54.112 --> 00:28:00.813]  They advise Paulson to use, first to bail out AIG and then to secretly
[00:28:01.994 --> 00:28:06.797]  Bailout favored banks, and in particular Goldman Sachs.
[00:28:07.157 --> 00:28:17.584]  Goldman Sachs got $12.9 billion, the biggest single recipient of taxpayer money, through this kind of bailout.
[00:28:17.724 --> 00:28:29.132]  And then both Paulson, and then it continued under the Obama administration, Geithner, tried very hard to make sure that we the public would never learn
[00:28:30.087 --> 00:28:31.989]  That our taxpayer dollars had done that.
[00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:39.494]  What changed that, and this is why people should not give up, was political pressure from Congress.
[00:28:40.715 --> 00:28:50.141]  And political pressure not on the administration, which was, you know, let it roll off its back like a duck, but political pressure on AIG.
[00:28:50.761 --> 00:28:52.142]  And here's what the mantra was.
[00:28:52.663 --> 00:28:54.024]  Not a penny more.
[00:28:54.904 --> 00:28:57.326]  Not a penny more of taxpayer money
[00:28:57.773 --> 00:29:02.174]  It goes to AIG until we know how the money has been used.
[00:29:02.635 --> 00:29:16.019]  And that's pressure on AIG is the only reason we know about the Goldman bailout, or that the fact that $50 billion roughly of US taxpayer money went to bail out foreign banks.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.900]  Foreign banks.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.761]  Why would we do that?
[00:29:21.561 --> 00:29:25.042]  Including UBS, a massive Swiss bank.
[00:29:26.206 --> 00:29:37.954]  That at the same time we were bailing them out secretly with 5 billion dollars, the US government tells us that UBS was involved in defrauding the taxpayers of America.
[00:29:40.056 --> 00:29:46.180]  We hit them with a huge fine in a settlement of 780 million dollars.
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.401]  But you do the math.
[00:29:47.821 --> 00:29:54.826]  If we gave them 5 billion dollars and they paid us 780 million, who really paid the fine?
[00:29:56.072 --> 00:29:56.432]  The U.S.
[00:29:56.452 --> 00:29:58.193]  taxpayers really paid that fine.
[00:29:58.473 --> 00:30:09.518]  Yeah, we're paying them to steal from us, and you've got Bloomberg's reporting $12.8 trillion committed, and that's almost the gross domestic product of the country.
[00:30:10.079 --> 00:30:12.720]  Am I right in saying this is the biggest fraud in history?
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.861]  Oh, easily.
[00:30:15.401 --> 00:30:23.985]  And that's why I think our mantra should be, not a penny more until we have a PCORA investigation started.
[00:30:25.734 --> 00:30:33.060]  was the guy, experienced prosecutor that we brought in the Great Depression to say, find out the facts.
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:40.546]  And the Wall Street fat cats hated him, detested him, fought him every step of the way.
[00:30:40.926 --> 00:30:42.527]  But he found the facts.
[00:30:42.868 --> 00:30:44.669]  He found the widespread fraud.
[00:30:44.969 --> 00:30:54.337]  And it led to many of the statutory changes that for 50 years worked so successfully in America
[00:30:54.870 --> 00:31:05.293]  Until Wall Street, you know, finally got enough political juice to get rid of the laws right near the end of the Clinton administration.
[00:31:05.713 --> 00:31:18.597]  Now on record, it was the Clinton people with the Republicans in tandem in the 90s that gutted most of this, and then George W. Bush was a happy participant in the run-up to what we see now.
[00:31:19.217 --> 00:31:21.038]  Can you speak specifically to that?
[00:31:23.661 --> 00:31:29.182]  And in your own words, is this not a complete hijacking of our entire economy by Wall Street?
[00:31:31.063 --> 00:31:39.005]  Well, yes, I can't speak to that directly, and yes, it was at the, they were at the beck and call of the industry.
[00:31:39.425 --> 00:31:53.148]  The laws passed by overwhelming margins, but this was very much a Rubin, Summers, and Phil Graham working together special to get rid of Glass-Steagall.
[00:31:54.197 --> 00:32:10.105]  And then the shutting down of Brooksley Bourne when she was trying to regulate these credit default swaps that destroyed AIG, that again was Summers and Phil Graham working together.
[00:32:10.125 --> 00:32:14.027]  This is so bizarre.
[00:32:14.708 --> 00:32:21.151]  They not only passed a law that stopped her particular proposed regulation,
[00:32:21.823 --> 00:32:26.342]  The law said you can't regulate to protect the taxpayers at all.
[00:32:29.975 --> 00:32:34.919]  So they are legislating protection of crime.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:50.052]  For people that don't understand, can you explain what toxic... I mean, for those that may not be able to grasp it or who've heard it bantered around in the media but don't, you know, get exactly what it is, can you explain what these toxic, toxic waste assets are?
[00:32:50.072 --> 00:32:51.974]  I mean, am I right in saying they're just
[00:32:52.614 --> 00:33:07.540]  Fiat, fraudulent, Ponzi scheme, mining stock in Arizona type, you know, crud, that they then have big insurance companies certify, and then that becomes another toxic layer of debt.
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:20.006]  Those certifications are then traded, and then how many layers in the pyramid, you know, as they nest, like Russian dolls, these frauds within each other.
[00:33:20.066 --> 00:33:20.546]  I mean, this is
[00:33:21.306 --> 00:33:26.228]  This is the biggest, I mean, to my mind, it's just such a ridiculous scam on its face.
[00:33:26.928 --> 00:33:28.629]  Well, you're right that it's layered.
[00:33:28.749 --> 00:33:33.450]  It isn't typically mining stock, you know, fake mining stock.
[00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:41.393]  It was typically what we call subprime or liar's loans, what we call the underlined.
[00:33:41.953 --> 00:33:45.635]  And that means, as it became in truth in 2006, 2007,
[00:33:49.511 --> 00:33:55.875]  Lending to folks where a very substantial number of people were going to default on the mortgages.
[00:33:55.955 --> 00:33:57.896]  We're talking maybe 25%.
[00:33:59.878 --> 00:34:05.761]  Typically default rates on prime mortgages run under 1% to give you a contrast.
[00:34:06.482 --> 00:34:09.444]  So something 25 times as bad roughly.
[00:34:12.225 --> 00:34:16.208]  And then you did create lots of elaborate
[00:34:17.116 --> 00:34:17.597]  We're good to go.
[00:34:41.363 --> 00:34:43.064]  Stack things on top of each other?
[00:34:43.624 --> 00:34:43.904]  Yes.
[00:34:44.225 --> 00:34:45.805]  And they can hold up and they can hold up.
[00:34:45.825 --> 00:34:48.207]  They start shaking and they become more unwieldy.
[00:34:48.607 --> 00:34:55.931]  And the bad news is, the longer it holds together before it collapses, the bigger the collapse and the more damage when it collapses.
[00:34:58.072 --> 00:35:00.774]  So the old adage of the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[00:35:02.414 --> 00:35:05.056]  Yeah, well, now they don't fall at all, right?
[00:35:05.816 --> 00:35:07.177]  They're not allowed to fall.
[00:35:07.297 --> 00:35:08.978]  I mean, President Obama
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.662]  What happens when you give people immunity in advance?
[00:35:31.044 --> 00:35:32.405]  It causes recklessness.
[00:35:32.866 --> 00:35:34.067]  At best.
[00:35:34.527 --> 00:35:39.031]  Recklessness on a good day, outright fraud on most days.
[00:35:39.071 --> 00:35:44.255]  So can you describe this then, if it's not even a Ponzi scheme that's meant to fail now, then what is it?
[00:35:44.495 --> 00:35:45.836]  A debt bomb?
[00:35:46.217 --> 00:35:49.119]  Or like a black hole that then is going to suck everything into it?
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.401]  Oh no, it was a Ponzi dynamic.
[00:35:51.441 --> 00:35:58.367]  You had to grow and grow and grow much more rapidly, which is why people poured on the toxic waste.
[00:35:59.025 --> 00:36:02.546]  At increasingly fast rates in 2006-2007.
[00:36:02.806 --> 00:36:03.766]  But that's what I'm asking.
[00:36:03.806 --> 00:36:08.068]  This is a Ponzi scheme that then blows up and turns into a black hole.
[00:36:08.088 --> 00:36:08.888]  Yeah.
[00:36:09.068 --> 00:36:18.611]  One institution, IndyMac, sold 80 billion dollars of liars loans in one year.
[00:36:20.131 --> 00:36:26.413]  In four and a half years, it sold far more liars loans
[00:36:27.059 --> 00:36:29.000]  than the entire savings and loan debacle.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:36.923]  So IndyMac all by itself pretty much cost the same as the entire savings and loan debacle.
[00:36:37.603 --> 00:36:42.905]  See how intensifying, how much worse it gets if you don't fix the underlying problem.
[00:36:43.065 --> 00:36:47.827]  So they knew though, I mean all along they knew this was going to implode and then devastate things.
[00:36:48.788 --> 00:36:50.648]  They were selling liar's loans.
[00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.909]  What was to know?
[00:36:53.314 --> 00:36:55.075]  No, I mean, I understand that.
[00:36:55.395 --> 00:36:57.116]  How more transparent can you get?
[00:36:57.356 --> 00:37:02.758]  So, so clearly... Can you imagine coming to the regulators saying, hi, we've got a new strategic business plan.
[00:37:02.798 --> 00:37:03.439]  Great, what is it?
[00:37:03.659 --> 00:37:05.280]  We're going to make fraudulent loans.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.540]  Oh, okay.
[00:37:09.361 --> 00:37:12.203]  And so this, this is key, Professor.
[00:37:13.563 --> 00:37:16.645]  You're saying that, I mean, just on record,
[00:37:17.915 --> 00:37:28.561]  That the people that remove these laws, because I remember seeing Senator Dornan and others say this was going to happen on the floor, but he was against it.
[00:37:28.722 --> 00:37:36.306]  They knew from setting it up, from running it up to running it down, they fully knew, and this was premeditated.
[00:37:37.127 --> 00:37:38.187]  No, I'm not saying that.
[00:37:38.247 --> 00:37:40.569]  I don't know that Congress knows.
[00:37:40.629 --> 00:37:47.633]  I'm telling you that in the trade, everybody knew that if you made something called a liar's loan,
[00:37:48.166 --> 00:37:54.029]  It was because they were frauds, overwhelmingly, and that it was going to produce a disaster.
[00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:57.351]  Now, Congress, of course, is paid not to know, right?
[00:37:57.771 --> 00:38:02.194]  The bankers don't go in front of Congress and say, hi, we want to produce a disaster.
[00:38:02.834 --> 00:38:03.715]  Please take our money.
[00:38:04.815 --> 00:38:16.282]  They tell Congress, hey, we have this wonderful new thing, financial derivatives, and everybody, which is to say us, you know, on Wall Street, says this is the greatest thing
[00:38:16.832 --> 00:38:18.914]  Since sliced bread, right?
[00:38:19.294 --> 00:38:21.176]  And everything's going to be wonderful.
[00:38:21.537 --> 00:38:30.885]  And, and we need it because unless we have it, we can't compete with the German massive, what are called universal banks that can do anything.
[00:38:31.306 --> 00:38:39.674]  So we have to get rid of every protection we've ever put in place in the United States so that our big banks can compete with their giant banks.
[00:38:40.554 --> 00:38:42.056]  That's how they sold it to Congress.
[00:38:44.175 --> 00:38:48.718]  But obviously, somebody in Congress before knew it was bad, or it wouldn't have been illegal previously.
[00:38:49.639 --> 00:38:53.622]  Well, yes, because we did an investigation and we found the facts.
[00:38:53.962 --> 00:39:07.292]  So, I urge your listeners to join us in demanding an investigation of what caused the problem, and of course, that we then fix the problem as opposed to ignore it.
[00:39:07.692 --> 00:39:08.653]  Alright, in your own words.
[00:39:08.673 --> 00:39:12.536]  We did fix it after the Great Depression, and it worked for
[00:39:13.223 --> 00:39:15.866]  You know, a whole two generations of Americans.
[00:39:16.306 --> 00:39:24.294]  Alright, well we're going to get into solutions in the final segment coming up, but I also want folks to get your book, The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One, by our guest, William K. Black.
[00:39:25.015 --> 00:39:32.822]  But, Mr. Black, specifically, you've been very critical, even though you were a supporter of Obama, of Geithner and others.
[00:39:32.862 --> 00:39:35.044]  Specifically, what has Geithner been up to?
[00:39:35.084 --> 00:39:37.507]  I mean, isn't he a central figure in all of this?
[00:39:38.627 --> 00:39:53.651]  Absolutely, and he makes it absolutely clear that Obama in this category, finance, was continuing the Paulson policies, because Geithner was Paulson's right-hand man.
[00:39:54.971 --> 00:40:02.193]  And you would have thought that would have disqualified him, but for some reason that was viewed as a positive by the Obama administration.
[00:40:02.713 --> 00:40:06.814]  And so he was not only kept on, he was promoted to Treasury Secretary.
[00:40:07.481 --> 00:40:12.908]  And of course he's continued these policies and in some ways he's actually made them worse.
[00:40:13.389 --> 00:40:17.554]  And that's saying something because the Paulson policies were horrific.
[00:40:20.583 --> 00:40:34.055]  And then Obama comes out and says, I'm fighting the CEO bonuses, and then it turns out he wrote the executive order and told Senator Dodd to write the loophole in the stimulus package.
[00:40:34.115 --> 00:40:38.419]  I mean, that is a new level in arrogant lying.
[00:40:39.299 --> 00:40:47.807]  Well, and it's not just that, because the press reports also show that Treasury is currently working behind the scenes
[00:40:48.226 --> 00:41:00.394]  With Wall Street to try to exempt them effectively from even the existing laws that were passed in part over the opposition of the Obama administration.
[00:41:01.175 --> 00:41:01.275]  Right?
[00:41:01.355 --> 00:41:06.278]  In the stimulus bill, and this again, but you know, don't give up folks.
[00:41:06.979 --> 00:41:11.061]  In the stimulus bill, there was a revolt among Democrats.
[00:41:12.522 --> 00:41:16.205]  And in complete opposition to what President Obama wanted,
[00:41:16.604 --> 00:41:21.969]  They put some restraint on bonuses and compensation into the stimulus bill.
[00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:31.999]  But of course, as I said, the reports are that the Obama administration is now trying to work with Wall Street to help evade those restrictions.
[00:41:32.639 --> 00:41:38.525]  We need to re-energize both sides of the aisle to stop this.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:49.704]  Mr. Black, what does it mean when they do these stress tests to the banks, and then say to the banks, don't tell the public what we found, and then it leaks that the banks are really in dire situation?
[00:41:51.105 --> 00:41:54.206]  Oh no, it doesn't leak that they're really in dire situation.
[00:41:54.226 --> 00:41:57.808]  They're busy leaking the propaganda that everything's wonderful.
[00:41:58.648 --> 00:42:04.671]  And it's being picked up uncritically in places like Bloomberg and the New York Times.
[00:42:05.491 --> 00:42:07.892]  The stress tests are a sham, and I've said that.
[00:42:08.502 --> 00:42:16.287]  You know, people can go on the web, sites like Naked Capitalism, and see excerpts of my reasons why it's a sham.
[00:42:16.648 --> 00:42:20.971]  I predicted in advance it would be a sham, and it's obviously proven to be a sham.
[00:42:21.331 --> 00:42:23.472]  That's my next question, and we're about to break.
[00:42:23.592 --> 00:42:25.974]  Where can people find the body of your work?
[00:42:26.034 --> 00:42:26.595]  It's prolific.
[00:42:26.615 --> 00:42:31.178]  I mean, they can buy your book in stores, but how do folks find your writings?
[00:42:31.198 --> 00:42:32.939]  Just Google William K. Black?
[00:42:33.739 --> 00:42:35.761]  That will work, although you'll get many hits.
[00:42:36.909 --> 00:42:39.811]  Or go to, you said, the nakedcapitalist.com?
[00:42:40.552 --> 00:42:43.394]  Naked Capitalism is one of the financial blog sites.
[00:42:43.434 --> 00:42:44.595]  You can look at Huffington Post.
[00:42:44.635 --> 00:42:45.655]  You can look at Cato.
[00:42:47.857 --> 00:42:48.858]  All right, stay there, sir.
[00:42:48.878 --> 00:42:50.959]  We really appreciate you being with us.
[00:42:50.979 --> 00:42:55.262]  An amazing individual, William K. Black, is our guest.
[00:42:55.282 --> 00:42:55.963]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:01.127 --> 00:43:11.235]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:43:11.715 --> 00:43:12.756]  Garden in a Can!
[00:43:13.136 --> 00:43:16.699]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.041]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.
[00:43:19.281 --> 00:43:21.583]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.

[00:43:34.347 --> 00:43:34.647]  Fresh.

[00:43:51.477 --> 00:43:53.238]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:44:03.743 --> 00:44:05.867]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:44:06.368 --> 00:44:13.380]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:44:13.954 --> 00:44:20.120]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.362]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:22.502 --> 00:44:24.924]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:44:25.004 --> 00:44:35.954]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:44:36.595 --> 00:44:37.876]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:38.257 --> 00:44:39.638]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:44:40.111 --> 00:44:46.439]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.042]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:45:02.162 --> 00:45:07.368]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:45:07.528 --> 00:45:08.869]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:45:09.129 --> 00:45:17.318]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:46:03.631 --> 00:46:09.615]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:46:10.249 --> 00:46:13.225]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:46:15.495 --> 00:46:24.460]  That's right, there is a war on for your mind, and we have somebody who's a great captain for Liberty in the fight to get people to open their minds and wake up.
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:31.764]  William K. Black, author of The Best Selling, wrote it three, four years ago, and it's best seller again, because he predicted everything that was going to happen.
[00:46:32.165 --> 00:46:34.226]  The best way to rob a bank is to own one.
[00:46:34.766 --> 00:46:35.547]  Be sure and get that.
[00:46:36.067 --> 00:46:38.929]  Because if we don't turn this around, you know, that's the big question, sir.
[00:46:39.069 --> 00:46:44.472]  If we don't turn this around, and they just continue the Ponzi schemes that are now getting
[00:46:46.175 --> 00:46:51.517]  Galactic in size, where is this leading us?
[00:46:52.657 --> 00:46:54.798]  Well, you can already see where it's been leading, right?
[00:46:54.838 --> 00:47:06.321]  The savings and loan crisis, it was a miracle it was contained when it was because the political pressure there was even more severe than you had here.
[00:47:06.381 --> 00:47:15.304]  But you turned out to have this incredibly brave regulator, Ed Gray, who took on his own administration, took on Wall Street,
[00:47:16.091 --> 00:47:18.111]  Uh, and succeeded, uh, brilliantly.
[00:47:18.372 --> 00:47:21.392]  But there's been nobody like that in this crisis.
[00:47:21.492 --> 00:47:24.893]  So, you had the savings and loan at about $150 billion.
[00:47:24.913 --> 00:47:28.994]  Then you go over to Russia, and they tried out these ideas of Russian privatization.
[00:47:29.474 --> 00:47:36.955]  And it produced massive corruption and the rise of a few very, very rich multibillionaires.
[00:47:37.796 --> 00:47:39.776]  Uh, many of them connected with organized crime.
[00:47:40.276 --> 00:47:40.956]  The oligarchs!
[00:47:41.476 --> 00:47:42.297]  The oligarchs.
[00:47:42.717 --> 00:47:44.397]  And it, you know, when this happens,
[00:47:45.106 --> 00:47:48.989]  Look what happens politically in reaction.
[00:47:49.169 --> 00:47:53.974]  You get dramatic political changes as people become infuriated.
[00:47:54.234 --> 00:47:55.255]  So where did they hit next?
[00:47:56.055 --> 00:47:59.078]  This was the Washington Consensus, was their phrase.
[00:47:59.518 --> 00:48:03.061]  That we knew how to run life and it was the way Wall Street said.
[00:48:03.361 --> 00:48:05.423]  And so they did this through Latin America.
[00:48:05.763 --> 00:48:07.125]  And what did it produce there?
[00:48:07.145 --> 00:48:13.330]  Ten years of stagnation and incredible corruption and giveaways
[00:48:14.151 --> 00:48:21.452]  To the biggest, you know, their version of Wall Street, and what has happened politically, who's getting elected in Latin America?
[00:48:21.472 --> 00:48:30.554]  You know, people that now intensely hate capitalism and America in reaction.
[00:48:30.934 --> 00:48:42.036]  Well, we didn't learn any of those lessons from any of those crises, so we're currently in this one, and this one is big enough that it's global, and it's going to be the most severe recession
[00:48:42.924 --> 00:48:46.066]  In the lives of anybody under the age of 80.
[00:48:46.106 --> 00:48:53.011]  We can't afford to repeat it because you don't just repeat as I've been trying to get across.
[00:48:53.692 --> 00:48:57.795]  When you don't fix it, it doesn't just repeat, it comes back much worse.
[00:48:58.046 --> 00:49:15.700]  Okay, we're going to get to solutions in the final segment coming up in a moment, but Madoff, you talk about organized crime, it's now in the Times of London and the Associated Press, I'm sure you've seen it, that Cuomo's going after one of Madoff's managers, and they're saying they believe there's organized crime, drug money, laundering going on.
[00:49:17.581 --> 00:49:26.208]  In all of the really big frauds, you're going to find the other thing we haven't talked about, and that is the role of the offshore stuff.
[00:49:27.116 --> 00:49:27.316]  Right?
[00:49:27.616 --> 00:49:43.870]  Which is like UBS, we were talking at the giant Swiss bank, where very, very wealthy people evade taxes by putting their money in these tax havens, and that always leads to wide-scale corruption.
[00:49:45.299 --> 00:49:47.280]  And doesn't it lead to selective enforcement, though?
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:58.445]  I mean, we see Geithner and all of them saying they're going to go after this, but then when you read the fine print, it's selectively, and that's what the Caymans and the Virgin Islands and the Swiss are saying.
[00:49:58.485 --> 00:49:59.325]  Is there any truth to that?
[00:50:00.186 --> 00:50:03.547]  Well, that's certainly true, period.
[00:50:03.627 --> 00:50:09.570]  In other words, if you look, in the Bush administration, what's particularly terrible on this
[00:50:10.579 --> 00:50:17.525]  It largely reoriented its enforcement against poor taxpayers in a way for rich taxpayers.
[00:50:18.666 --> 00:50:21.608]  Actually, what we're trying to do on UBS might reverse that a bit.
[00:50:21.848 --> 00:50:22.589]  That would be good news.
[00:50:22.829 --> 00:50:23.610]  We're going to come right back.
[00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:24.590]  I want to finish up with that.
[00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:25.111]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:50:25.151 --> 00:50:35.439]  I remember seeing the numbers where they took almost all the FBI agents off the billionaire swindlers and put them on blue collar and white collar, you know, mid-level stuff.
[00:50:36.119 --> 00:50:37.180]  It's just amazing.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.242]  Talk about Fox running the hen house.
[00:50:43.191 --> 00:50:44.772]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:45.672 --> 00:50:48.074]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:50.875 --> 00:50:51.476]  Hello, friends.
[00:50:51.516 --> 00:50:52.476]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:50:52.576 --> 00:50:57.159]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:50:57.319 --> 00:51:00.081]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:51:00.281 --> 00:51:03.142]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:03.323 --> 00:51:09.166]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:51:09.406 --> 00:51:12.369]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:12.629 --> 00:51:19.556]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:51:19.636 --> 00:51:22.759]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:51:22.899 --> 00:51:24.280]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[00:51:28.044 --> 00:51:34.128]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:38.051]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:38.071 --> 00:51:39.392]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:51:39.432 --> 00:51:40.033]  Take action today.
[00:51:40.053 --> 00:51:42.034]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:53.590 --> 00:51:55.517]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:55.978 --> 00:51:58.768]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:11.098 --> 00:52:16.206]  I am chomping at the bit to be there in his law offices in Kansas City at the law school.
[00:52:16.927 --> 00:52:18.770]  Aaron and Rob are up there.
[00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:24.098]  They're about to do an interview with him for TV here in Austin and film work we're doing.
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:29.183]  That's just amazing, because I've studied this constantly and I have all these guests on.
[00:52:29.303 --> 00:52:31.745]  And to talk to Mr. Black, he just puts it all together.
[00:52:31.765 --> 00:52:36.169]  Okay, you were getting into what I've even seen in the New York Times and Washington Post.
[00:52:36.189 --> 00:52:46.698]  They admit that under Bush, they took most of the regulators and most of the FBI investigators off the big tax thieves and put them literally on mom and pops.
[00:52:47.178 --> 00:52:52.082]  I mean, if that is an open, conscious criminality, I mean, you'd think the government would want these tax revenues.
[00:52:52.102 --> 00:52:52.743]  Can you speak to that?
[00:52:53.632 --> 00:52:55.673]  Yeah, they throw away money.
[00:52:56.854 --> 00:52:58.695]  It's completely insane.
[00:52:59.755 --> 00:53:10.662]  They cut the overall number, even though they knew that they would cost them more in lost taxes that they would save by not having enough IRS people.
[00:53:11.042 --> 00:53:20.087]  And then they oriented the IRS people overwhelmingly towards not even middle class, but actually working class Americans.
[00:53:23.203 --> 00:53:25.525]  You know, it's a spectacular misuse of money.
[00:53:25.825 --> 00:53:31.389]  It results in far less tax dollars being, far fewer tax dollars being collected.
[00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:36.713]  There's nobody that can defend it, but it's part of the general piece.
[00:53:36.733 --> 00:53:46.720]  You know, white-collar prosecutions are down more than 25% under the Bush administration, when of course white-collar crimes reached
[00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:49.150]  An unprecedented level in history.
[00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:52.191]  And now it's accelerating under Obama.
[00:53:52.791 --> 00:53:54.631]  I mean, are we seeing an acceleration of that?
[00:53:54.651 --> 00:53:56.872]  I mean, I don't see them changing the enforcement.
[00:53:57.472 --> 00:53:59.092]  Well, we certainly haven't seen it yet.
[00:53:59.112 --> 00:54:11.935]  I talked earlier that they first announced that they were actually going to investigate the big lenders, which they themselves, again, said were the key frauds two years ago, March 2007.
[00:54:13.055 --> 00:54:14.756]  Not a single major indictment.
[00:54:15.996 --> 00:54:16.856]  So, you know,
[00:54:17.768 --> 00:54:25.606]  Maybe they're having the most wonderful, most secret, most successful investigation of all time, and there have been no leaks.
[00:54:26.128 --> 00:54:27.691]  But that doesn't sound like America to me.
[00:54:28.988 --> 00:54:32.610]  All right, we've only got a few minutes left, sir, and then I'll let you take a break and do the interview with the guys.
[00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:35.933]  Again, we're very thankful and we'll have you back up soon because you can't do this in an hour.
[00:54:36.713 --> 00:54:38.314]  In closing, what are the solutions?
[00:54:38.374 --> 00:54:53.304]  I mean, for me, if we start grand jury investigations, not just federal but state, if we go after more of these Madoff crooks, get them to flip and expose the larger system, isn't the quickest way to end this is to have investigations and start arresting people?
[00:54:53.344 --> 00:54:56.787]  I mean, won't that point out how this is criminal and needs to be stopped?
[00:54:57.438 --> 00:55:05.700]  But you won't get that as long as the failed bankers, often the fraudulent failed bankers, are left in positions of power.
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:18.983]  You need to put honest bankers in who will have the incentive and the orders to find where the bodies are buried and to make the necessary criminal referrals.
[00:55:19.283 --> 00:55:21.324]  The FBI cannot do this on its own.
[00:55:21.664 --> 00:55:23.664]  So, here's an action agenda.
[00:55:23.884 --> 00:55:26.885]  One, start the PCORA investigation immediately.
[00:55:27.601 --> 00:55:32.363]  2.
[00:55:28.001 --> 00:55:32.363]  Get rid of the bad bankers that caused the failures.
[00:55:32.383 --> 00:55:32.363]  3.
[00:55:32.723 --> 00:55:34.964]  Put honest, competent bankers in.
[00:55:34.984 --> 00:55:34.964]  4.
[00:55:35.684 --> 00:55:38.525]  Find the facts about the assets.
[00:55:38.545 --> 00:55:38.525]  5.
[00:55:39.046 --> 00:55:46.268]  Make the appropriate criminal referrals with detailed roadmaps for the FBI so they can make a successful case.
[00:55:47.209 --> 00:55:46.268]  6.
[00:55:47.689 --> 00:55:48.869]  Indict them.
[00:55:48.889 --> 00:55:48.869]  7.
[00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:51.650]  Look for the Achilles heel in the fraud.
[00:55:51.971 --> 00:55:53.811]  We don't have remotely enough people.
[00:55:53.871 --> 00:55:55.412]  We should, of course, increase
[00:55:55.908 --> 00:56:02.894]  Greatly the number of FBI agents, but you also have to do like an emergency in medicine.
[00:56:02.934 --> 00:56:03.935]  You have to triage.
[00:56:04.176 --> 00:56:05.297]  You have to prioritize.
[00:56:05.597 --> 00:56:07.519]  So go after the rating agencies.
[00:56:07.739 --> 00:56:08.900]  There are only three of them.
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:17.968]  With 20 competent regulators, you could rip that place out and build it in a competent, fresh fashion.
[00:56:18.469 --> 00:56:22.152]  And without the AAA ratings, this crisis
[00:56:22.668 --> 00:56:24.809]  Couldn't have become a global disaster.
[00:56:25.209 --> 00:56:26.710]  So there's my action agenda.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:49.789]  If we get the facts through a PCORI investigation, we will so embarrass them that they will not be able to block many of these reforms.
[00:56:50.029 --> 00:56:51.010]  And it is us or them.
[00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:53.132]  I mean, they're only going to make it worse if we don't do it, right?
[00:56:54.494 --> 00:56:56.456]  That's the whole history that I just went through.
[00:56:56.476 --> 00:56:58.258]  The policy is getting much worse.
[00:56:58.798 --> 00:57:00.260]  Thank you so much, Mr. Black.
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:01.341]  Thank you for spending time.
[00:57:04.056 --> 00:57:08.459]  You might not be able to spell Constitution, but you sure know how important it is.
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:14.464]  You might not be missing any shirts from your closet, but you have given the shirt off your back hundreds of times.
[00:57:15.004 --> 00:57:19.968]  You might not understand the thousands of laws that exist, but you do live by the Ten Commandments.
[00:57:20.308 --> 00:57:26.192]  You might not know who the bad guys are, or what you should be complaining about, but you do know what to be thankful for.
[00:57:26.613 --> 00:57:29.715]  You might not be looking for a government handout, but you do know how
[00:57:34.019 --> 00:57:38.262]  Not that you don't know, but you do know that you want to take care of your family.
[00:57:38.642 --> 00:57:39.983]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:57:40.304 --> 00:57:44.247]  You might not be able to own a farm, but you can have the food that came from one.
[00:57:44.547 --> 00:57:47.729]  eFoodsDirect.com, 800-409-5633.
[00:57:47.849 --> 00:57:53.173]  We're thankful for the chance to lend a hand with food for you and your family.
[00:57:53.513 --> 00:57:55.835]  On the web, eFoodsDirect.com or call 800-409-5633.
[00:58:01.491 --> 00:58:06.793]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:07.294 --> 00:58:14.277]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:58:14.877 --> 00:58:21.040]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:23.301]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:23.442 --> 00:58:25.843]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:25.943 --> 00:58:36.891]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:58:37.511 --> 00:58:38.792]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:39.192 --> 00:58:40.593]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:58:41.054 --> 00:58:47.278]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:58:56.205 --> 00:58:57.345]  The Obama Deception.
[00:58:57.785 --> 00:58:58.986]  The people strike back!
[00:59:01.095 --> 00:59:04.477]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:59:04.617 --> 00:59:09.840]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:14.803]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:59:15.183 --> 00:59:26.290]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:32.234]  The KDF Dual Medias Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or 1 year whichever comes first.
[00:59:32.474 --> 00:59:38.539]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:59:38.739 --> 00:59:39.379]  What about you?

[01:00:02.032 --> 01:00:07.596]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:25.384 --> 01:00:27.125]  Alright, here's the deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:28.146 --> 01:00:32.129]  We've been having so many guests on, I've been so busy that I haven't been taking a lot of calls lately.
[01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:35.812]  And I know we've got callers all over the map.
[01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:37.954]  I want to talk about a host of issues.
[01:00:39.175 --> 01:00:42.558]  Is this a current date of callers here, John, or have we even opened the phones up yet?
[01:00:44.171 --> 01:00:53.214]  Alright, I'm going to open the phone lines right now at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:53.234 --> 01:00:53.474]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:53.894 --> 01:00:55.654]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:55.934 --> 01:00:57.935]  Man, the lady that cut my hair cut it too short.
[01:00:58.215 --> 01:00:59.435]  I look like buckwheat now.
[01:00:59.995 --> 01:01:03.336]  My hair keeps sticking up and back, and I'm not somebody that cares how I look, but my goodness.
[01:01:03.356 --> 01:01:06.157]  I mean, I've now turned into buckwheat here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:06.417 --> 01:01:08.138]  You know buckwheat from the Little Rascals?
[01:01:08.178 --> 01:01:08.598]  He's got the...
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:10.561]  Got the hairstyle going.
[01:01:11.261 --> 01:01:15.884]  I guess the buckwheat looks kind of in, so I'm like styling here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:18.106 --> 01:01:18.946]  Oh my God.
[01:01:20.007 --> 01:01:20.967]  Get me a fauxhawk.
[01:01:21.528 --> 01:01:22.308]  What's a fauxhawk?
[01:01:25.951 --> 01:01:27.071]  Oh, he's got a fauxhawk.
[01:01:28.232 --> 01:01:29.673]  My God, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:30.774 --> 01:01:33.335]  Business suits have been replaced with fauxhawks.
[01:01:33.956 --> 01:01:34.356]  Alright, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:38.786 --> 01:01:44.728]  I mean, there was a former top federal regulator and investigator telling you that complete criminals run everything.
[01:01:45.428 --> 01:01:47.089]  I mean, they consciously are running it.
[01:01:47.469 --> 01:01:48.810]  The Foxes run the hen house.
[01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:51.071]  Congress is bankrolled by these people.
[01:01:51.111 --> 01:01:52.711]  The Republicans are bankrolled by them.
[01:01:53.031 --> 01:01:54.572]  Obama's bankrolled by them.
[01:01:54.812 --> 01:01:57.553]  It wouldn't matter who he elected, they would have done this.
[01:01:58.913 --> 01:02:02.715]  But they wanted Obama because they decided he could sucker people a little bit better.
[01:02:03.775 --> 01:02:04.355]  And that's it.
[01:02:05.216 --> 01:02:05.596]  Period.
[01:02:06.886 --> 01:02:17.096]  And, you know, I try to laugh about this, but it's not funny, because your pension funds, your police funds, your fire funds, your teacher funds, your private funds, were all invested in this, and they've already stolen about half of it.
[01:02:17.937 --> 01:02:18.998]  And they're going to steal it all.
[01:02:19.078 --> 01:02:21.220]  That's what this hyperinflation means.
[01:02:21.801 --> 01:02:23.242]  And that's guaranteed with what they've done.
[01:02:23.262 --> 01:02:30.690]  Let me run over some of the other headlines here that are very, very important.
[01:02:32.861 --> 01:02:36.347]  This is all my global government stack I had yesterday.
[01:02:37.468 --> 01:02:40.473]  Where's the stack I had earlier on the show?
[01:02:40.513 --> 01:02:41.515]  I wanted to go over that.
[01:02:41.535 --> 01:02:44.519]  I can't keep track of it anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:47.113 --> 01:02:51.535]  Well, what's happened is, and it's even happened to me, we've all gotten acclimated to live with corruption.
[01:02:51.915 --> 01:02:58.418]  To live with government out of control, and corporations out of control, and individuals out of control.
[01:02:58.478 --> 01:03:05.421]  I mean, we just put up with more crap than we should, and now criminals are just running over every facet of society.
[01:03:05.461 --> 01:03:10.323]  I mean, it's criminal when the police run a checkpoint without warrants, but we put up with it.
[01:03:10.663 --> 01:03:14.165]  It's criminal when they have the army out suddenly running checkpoints to acclimate us.
[01:03:14.525 --> 01:03:16.486]  Why do you think they're doing all of that?
[01:03:17.267 --> 01:03:23.434]  Because they're going to steal everything and take it offshore and they know people are going to riot and burn everything down.
[01:03:24.014 --> 01:03:28.279]  And they're going to march out the cops and military to have gun battles with you when you're doing it.
[01:03:30.321 --> 01:03:36.008]  And the banks even bragging their IMF World Bank documents that they love that because then they get to buy up what's left even cheaper.
[01:03:37.728 --> 01:03:40.070]  And I'm saying we don't want this to happen.
[01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:44.773]  And so I get newspapers attacking me because I'm calling for not having violence.
[01:03:45.513 --> 01:03:47.074]  The establishment is bold.
[01:03:47.174 --> 01:03:48.956]  They say, you want to murder cops.
[01:03:49.856 --> 01:03:52.038]  And I go, I just said we don't want this to happen.
[01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:52.758]  And they go, no.
[01:03:53.239 --> 01:03:54.259]  You want to murder cops.
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:55.820]  You cause cops to be murdered.
[01:03:56.921 --> 01:03:59.343]  And I'm going, the bankers are engineering a collapse.
[01:04:00.103 --> 01:04:01.704]  They're going to go after the people's guns.
[01:04:01.724 --> 01:04:02.705]  They've introduced the bills.
[01:04:02.765 --> 01:04:03.746]  It's going to be a bloodbath.
[01:04:04.126 --> 01:04:05.067]  We don't want violence.
[01:04:06.067 --> 01:04:06.628]  And they say,
[01:04:08.632 --> 01:04:09.132]  You know what?
[01:04:09.252 --> 01:04:10.013]  You're a cop killer.
[01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:14.614]  See, I mean, it's like, this is psychological warfare.
[01:04:17.815 --> 01:04:19.056]  They mean it to be crazy.
[01:04:19.076 --> 01:04:20.176]  They mean it to be wild.
[01:04:20.476 --> 01:04:30.120]  You know, why have they come out in the case of one Al Qaeda member and claimed he's been killed over 15 times and never retract the last time he was killed?
[01:04:32.041 --> 01:04:32.721]  Why do they do that?
[01:04:34.414 --> 01:04:36.336]  They never say he wasn't killed last time.
[01:04:36.396 --> 01:04:39.239]  Chemical Ali, they claim they killed him four times.
[01:04:39.299 --> 01:04:41.200]  Now they're saying they're going to execute him or something.
[01:04:41.761 --> 01:04:43.723]  And they would say, here he is, here's his dead body.
[01:04:43.983 --> 01:04:46.105]  Here's the dead bodies of Saddam's sons.
[01:04:46.125 --> 01:04:50.069]  And then they'd say a month later, oh, we killed Saddam's sons again.
[01:04:50.389 --> 01:04:51.991]  We killed Chemical Ali again.
[01:04:52.011 --> 01:04:54.013]  Oh, we killed him again six months later.
[01:04:54.393 --> 01:04:55.354]  Oh, we killed him again.
[01:04:55.594 --> 01:04:58.297]  And they never retract that we didn't kill him last time.
[01:04:59.315 --> 01:05:02.617]  They are practicing being caught as liars openly.
[01:05:03.357 --> 01:05:14.304]  It's a psychological tactic and psychological warfare to just be caught, and it's just... And then I remember the first time they said they killed him, they said, oh, here's their two dead bodies, bombed in a house, you can pull this up.
[01:05:14.804 --> 01:05:18.906]  And it said they've been reconstructed with wax and clay, so they're recognizable.
[01:05:19.707 --> 01:05:25.210]  And it's too... I mean, I could take a ball of clay and make a better fake head and stick a fake mustache on it.
[01:05:28.561 --> 01:05:31.143]  And I remember looking at the pictures on the news and saying, those are fake!
[01:05:31.443 --> 01:05:32.384]  Those aren't even people!
[01:05:34.185 --> 01:05:38.849]  And then they came out and the others said, oh yeah, it was reconstructed clay to show what their dead bodies looked like.
[01:05:39.489 --> 01:05:40.950]  That was in the news!
[01:05:42.211 --> 01:05:51.278]  Like they came out and said, uh, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed bombed all these buildings that were bombed four years after he was in custody.
[01:05:52.199 --> 01:05:54.960]  And the news just said, it doesn't matter if he was in custody, he bombed it.
[01:05:55.721 --> 01:05:57.541]  They just practice evil.
[01:05:58.162 --> 01:06:01.223]  They just practice lying constantly.
[01:06:02.244 --> 01:06:04.024]  But there's millions of other types of deception.
[01:06:04.225 --> 01:06:04.745]  Here's one.
[01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:22.207]  I'm on the treadmill this morning for 30 minutes, I didn't have enough time to be on there longer, and I'm watching CNN and Fox, I'm flipping back and forth, and it's Barack Obama's got a lot of rich Wall Street people in his administration, but David Gergen, a Republican, says that's a good idea because they're experts and know how to fix it.
[01:06:22.768 --> 01:06:23.789]  And the next piece was...
[01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:27.852]  He lost his arm in Iraq, but he's not even a U.S.
[01:06:27.912 --> 01:06:28.413]  citizen.
[01:06:28.453 --> 01:06:29.333]  How mean!
[01:06:29.674 --> 01:06:31.155]  But now he gets to become a U.S.
[01:06:31.175 --> 01:06:31.535]  citizen.
[01:06:31.855 --> 01:06:40.941]  That's meant to make you think it's okay that they're converting the majority of the force, from a big piece to a majority, to foreign or illegal aliens from all over the country, and all over the world.
[01:06:40.962 --> 01:06:50.648]  And then I was back there getting some coffee earlier, and it was another piece on another news channel, I think it was MSN, and we were recording it, and I'm seeing the propaganda.
[01:06:50.969 --> 01:06:53.991]  They got the same report on another channel!
[01:06:55.182 --> 01:06:56.743]  This is admittedly fake!
[01:06:57.544 --> 01:07:04.849]  To where, oh, I love the foreigners that make up our... They aren't bringing in foreign troops, though they've signed agreements to use purely foreign armies publicly.
[01:07:05.110 --> 01:07:06.791]  That isn't a rumor, that's mainstream news.
[01:07:07.511 --> 01:07:08.312]  Public agreements.
[01:07:08.732 --> 01:07:12.895]  Congress asked last year, what are you doing signing agreements to use foreign troops in the United States?
[01:07:13.276 --> 01:07:15.658]  And NORTHCOM said, have you read PDD 51?
[01:07:16.138 --> 01:07:16.938]  Shut up!
[01:07:17.759 --> 01:07:21.082]  Shut up, Congress, or we'll put you in a MIAC report!
[01:07:21.622 --> 01:07:22.783]  We run things now!
[01:07:23.443 --> 01:07:23.924]  Literally!
[01:07:26.189 --> 01:07:26.829]  Don't believe me.
[01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:29.050]  Guys, Google it.
[01:07:29.071 --> 01:07:32.472]  It was in the Toronto Star and a bunch of Canadian papers and one U.S.
[01:07:32.512 --> 01:07:32.772]  paper.
[01:07:33.753 --> 01:07:34.333]  Google this.
[01:07:35.394 --> 01:07:37.275]  Let me call up the exact headline.
[01:07:37.335 --> 01:07:37.635]  Hold on.
[01:07:37.675 --> 01:07:38.455]  Or close.
[01:07:38.776 --> 01:07:40.456]  I'll go to your calls.
[01:07:40.476 --> 01:07:49.281]  Because I keep getting emails saying they're not doing deals for foreign troops even though I've been to urban warfare drills where they're training to have foreign troops take your guns and admitting it's for America.
[01:07:49.521 --> 01:07:50.482]  Police State 2000.
[01:07:52.583 --> 01:07:52.983]  Let me think.
[01:07:55.854 --> 01:08:05.380]  Congress complains about not being notified about military agreement with Canada and Mexico.
[01:08:06.861 --> 01:08:10.784]  Congress complains about not being notified or not being included, something like that.
[01:08:11.084 --> 01:08:22.132]  And then you read the article, it just calmly says, oh, Canadian and Mexican troops signed deals in Canada today to, under NORTHCOM, police the United States during insurrection or terrorism.
[01:08:23.712 --> 01:08:28.717]  And then they come out in the Canadian paper and go, oh, the troops are going to be patrolling to stop drunks on the weekends.
[01:08:28.797 --> 01:08:29.357]  Same thing here.
[01:08:29.618 --> 01:08:31.439]  We're stopping drunk driving with the army.
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:32.781]  And then they announce it here.
[01:08:33.461 --> 01:08:37.145]  And the governor of Tennessee says, no, you're not going to use army on the streets of Tennessee.
[01:08:37.165 --> 01:08:37.525]  And they go...
[01:08:38.496 --> 01:08:39.116]  Oh, we aren't?
[01:08:39.657 --> 01:08:40.337]  Go to hell!
[01:08:40.998 --> 01:08:41.698]  Ha ha ha!
[01:08:41.978 --> 01:08:43.239]  That was last weekend!
[01:08:43.679 --> 01:08:45.040]  We're all, oh, we had a victory!
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:55.367]  The governor said no, and then we learned Monday, it's in the newspapers, the army was out, with highways shut down, quote, for over a mile, with the army searching people!
[01:08:56.107 --> 01:08:58.829]  And then I go, oh look, here's the Tennessee newspapers!
[01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:05.381]  And then I get national newspapers saying I'm a lying kook, and it doesn't exist!
[01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:09.946]  I mean, you know, it's reached a new level.
[01:09:10.567 --> 01:09:18.076]  Like Obama writing the executive order for the bonuses and then getting on TV saying, I'm gonna stop the bonuses, I'm outraged.
[01:09:20.512 --> 01:09:23.775]  I mean, they've introduced all these bills to basically ban guns in America.
[01:09:24.175 --> 01:09:26.517]  Unlimited banning is what one of the bills gives you.
[01:09:26.898 --> 01:09:28.399]  And then they just say to us, you're liars.
[01:09:28.839 --> 01:09:36.246]  I mean, I have newspaper reporters calling me, going, why are you putting out this disinformation that Obama wants the guns?
[01:09:36.266 --> 01:09:37.927]  And I go, well, let me give you some bill numbers.
[01:09:38.007 --> 01:09:39.528]  No, no, I'm not interested in that.
[01:09:39.929 --> 01:09:42.551]  You're not interested, you little... Man, I'm not gonna...
[01:09:45.441 --> 01:09:49.782]  I mean, folks, we're... total criminals run everything.
[01:09:50.122 --> 01:09:51.462]  We are screwed.
[01:09:51.863 --> 01:09:55.723]  And if we don't realize how bad it is, we have no hope of getting out of this.
[01:09:56.744 --> 01:10:08.066]  The house is caved in on us, you know, we're pinned, we're bleeding, and the American people are going, oh, it's a little cramped, but I... and I'm, like, in the rubble with them going, listen, this is really bad, we gotta work together to dig out of here.
[01:10:08.367 --> 01:10:11.407]  And, you know, and they're like, shut up, conspiracy theorist!
[01:10:11.427 --> 01:10:14.068]  Hold on, let me pull this two-by-four with nails out of my back.
[01:10:15.933 --> 01:10:24.556]  I mean, we're caved in here, and I'm saying, let's dig our way out, and the people are arguing, going, I don't know, the ceiling's supposed to be six inches from the floor.
[01:10:29.098 --> 01:10:34.020]  And there's those of us that have been trying to hold the house up, you know, we're down here in the mine, like the song Big John.
[01:10:36.052 --> 01:10:42.378]  And we're sitting around to hold this thing up together, and then the public's punching us in the stomach and chest going, stop it, conspiracy theorists!
[01:10:42.618 --> 01:10:43.959]  Stop being anti-government!
[01:10:44.119 --> 01:10:44.620]  You're evil!
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:45.681]  There's no new world order!
[01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:46.842]  There's no global bank!
[01:10:47.082 --> 01:10:47.943]  Everything's fine!
[01:10:48.023 --> 01:10:48.403]  Shut up!
[01:10:48.443 --> 01:10:50.485]  There's no one-child policy and no carbon tax!
[01:10:50.745 --> 01:10:51.566]  And they're just punching us.
[01:10:51.626 --> 01:10:52.487]  We're going, please, stop!
[01:10:52.927 --> 01:10:53.928]  They're just punching us.
[01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.689]  I'm going, please!
[01:10:54.909 --> 01:10:59.193]  We're trying to hold up things, you know, and they're just, bam, bam, bam, they're just, like, punching us as fast as they can.
[01:10:59.393 --> 01:10:59.934]  We're going, please!
[01:11:00.154 --> 01:11:01.235]  Please, we can't hold it much longer!
[01:11:01.375 --> 01:11:02.476]  My God, they're building FEMA camps!
[01:11:02.656 --> 01:11:03.296]  Shut up, liar!
[01:11:03.316 --> 01:11:04.257]  The government loves me!
[01:11:04.477 --> 01:11:04.817]  Shut up!
[01:11:04.977 --> 01:11:06.278]  They're just punching, punching!
[01:11:06.558 --> 01:11:07.839]  Number one, please, please!
[01:11:08.639 --> 01:11:09.960]  You know, please stop punching!
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.421]  No, no, the government's good!
[01:11:11.441 --> 01:11:12.522]  The government loves me!
[01:11:12.542 --> 01:11:14.343]  They're just punching, punching, punching, punching!
[01:11:14.783 --> 01:11:17.965]  The cops are reading Mayak reports and pulling Ron Paul supporters over.
[01:11:17.985 --> 01:11:18.766]  Get out of the car!
[01:11:19.266 --> 01:11:23.149]  And of course, then they're starting to buy guns and starting to go, whoa, we're going to have to fight!
[01:11:23.609 --> 01:11:26.671]  Do you see how this is a self-fulfilling prophecy?
[01:11:32.401 --> 01:11:34.022]  You understand this is real?
[01:11:34.242 --> 01:11:35.762]  Tyranny's come to our shores?
[01:11:38.143 --> 01:11:39.184]  Bondage is coming!
[01:11:41.845 --> 01:11:42.985]  And no, you don't understand that.
[01:11:43.025 --> 01:11:51.228]  You're arrogant, you like your petty power in government, and the yuppies think everything's fine, and you have no idea how bad this is gonna get.
[01:11:52.929 --> 01:11:59.051]  But, down the road you will, and we can still turn it around and beat it, Pelosi's openly saying national gun registration,
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:03.983]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.

[01:14:01.115 --> 01:14:06.361]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:14:07.154 --> 01:14:12.519]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:14:13.039 --> 01:14:19.224]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:14:19.544 --> 01:14:21.346]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:14:21.506 --> 01:14:23.908]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:14:23.968 --> 01:14:34.857]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:14:37.142 --> 01:14:38.403]  It's not about left or right.
[01:14:38.804 --> 01:14:40.225]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:14:40.666 --> 01:14:47.013]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:14:47.593 --> 01:14:55.361]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:14:55.862 --> 01:14:57.003]  The Obama Deception.
[01:14:57.423 --> 01:14:58.605]  The people strike back.
[01:15:00.754 --> 01:15:08.400]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.001]  You need the Paclite!
[01:15:10.441 --> 01:15:18.287]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[01:15:18.668 --> 01:15:21.830]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:26.674]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[01:15:27.054 --> 01:15:28.335]  The Paclite is so durable,
[01:15:28.595 --> 01:15:32.979]  Soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:37.724]  The PackLite comes with a 25 year warranty, and prices start at just $12.99.
[01:15:38.084 --> 01:15:44.770]  To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this small flashlight can be, visit 9voltlite.com.

[01:15:53.778 --> 01:15:57.340]  4448.
[01:15:54.118 --> 01:15:57.340]  That's 877-715-4448.
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:06.163]  You know, home game.
[01:16:06.223 --> 01:16:10.064]  One of our sponsors just sent us all these little orange gorillas.
[01:16:10.244 --> 01:16:10.864]  Bring one in.
[01:16:11.905 --> 01:16:14.005]  I want to make a tinfoil hat for one of them.
[01:16:14.065 --> 01:16:18.607]  Because if you think the banks are corrupt and out of control, you're a tinfoil hat person.
[01:16:19.327 --> 01:16:20.668]  Look at that.
[01:16:21.008 --> 01:16:21.548]  Very evil.
[01:16:22.685 --> 01:16:24.226]  This is probably in a MIAC report.
[01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:26.408]  Ha ha ha, yeah!
[01:16:27.148 --> 01:16:27.749]  Ha!
[01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:29.250]  Ninja attack, anyways.
[01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.731]  You know what?
[01:16:31.772 --> 01:16:32.692]  I try to have fun.
[01:16:32.712 --> 01:16:34.734]  And I apologize.
[01:16:34.774 --> 01:16:35.734]  I need to be more serious.
[01:16:37.195 --> 01:16:39.597]  Let's just go to your phone calls right now, as promised.
[01:16:40.057 --> 01:16:42.539]  Joe in New Mexico, sir, you're on the air.
[01:16:42.599 --> 01:16:42.979]  Welcome.
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:44.401]  Hey, Alex.
[01:16:46.002 --> 01:16:50.505]  I'm getting kind of frustrated here, and I was listening to that William Black interview with you.
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:53.842]  And I watched his Moyers.
[01:16:55.222 --> 01:16:57.484]  People gotta go back and watch the third segment on that.
[01:16:57.764 --> 01:17:00.126]  This guy is, he's holding back.
[01:17:00.566 --> 01:17:02.607]  You know, you are a truth seeker.
[01:17:02.927 --> 01:17:05.589]  This guy, in my opinion, he's pulling his leg back.
[01:17:06.510 --> 01:17:17.977]  And the reason why I say that, Alex, is he talks about how these guys have good intentions and they were just frankly scared, and that's why they did the bailouts.
[01:17:18.444 --> 01:17:25.445]  You know, ask him what's up with the WAMU and JPMorgan, a solvent entity being sucked up by JPMorgan.
[01:17:25.465 --> 01:17:31.627]  Well, I mean, he's on this show saying that they engineered the thing knowing it would collapse and that they're criminals.
[01:17:31.667 --> 01:17:35.107]  I mean, he's one of the strongest voices out there at his level.
[01:17:36.608 --> 01:17:40.069]  He is, but Alex, the guy that's holding back, he knows more.
[01:17:42.952 --> 01:17:43.992]  He knows a lot more.
[01:17:44.752 --> 01:17:47.613]  And I just wonder why he's scared or holding back.
[01:17:47.673 --> 01:17:48.613]  He's not like you.
[01:17:48.933 --> 01:17:52.114]  He doesn't go full bore and say, these are the facts.
[01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:53.854]  You can just see it.
[01:17:54.455 --> 01:17:55.495]  There's more to this.
[01:17:55.555 --> 01:18:00.076]  And I think he's pulling a Glenn Beck and he's desensitizing people on the issue.
[01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:03.897]  And it's kind of following what I'm saying.
[01:18:03.957 --> 01:18:04.777]  I'm just frustrated.
[01:18:05.888 --> 01:18:13.115]  No, I hear you, but instead of worrying about the bankers taking over and everything that's happening and admitting they're chemtrailing us now, just deny it all!
[01:18:13.675 --> 01:18:15.978]  You know, because you don't want them to say you wear a tinfoil hat.
[01:18:16.018 --> 01:18:19.841]  I mean, the governments have always... No, but it's like the Tea Parties, Alex.
[01:18:20.141 --> 01:18:21.463]  They're talking about taxation.
[01:18:21.483 --> 01:18:23.745]  The problem is the stinkin' Federal Reserve!
[01:18:24.946 --> 01:18:25.766]  No, no, I agree.
[01:18:25.966 --> 01:18:27.927]  But listen, more and more it's a process.
[01:18:28.327 --> 01:18:34.729]  More and more at those Tea Party meetings, they are talking about the private Federal Reserve and the New World Order.
[01:18:35.009 --> 01:18:42.631]  So what's happening, and that's the reason Fox News is having to at least pay lip service to FEMA, Cams, and New World Order and global currency now, is because
[01:18:43.371 --> 01:18:49.996]  Conservatives, Libertarians, and Liberals have been woken up by people like you and I and many others, and so they've lost all credibility.
[01:18:50.016 --> 01:18:55.600]  So you even hear a lot of this stuff on CNBC and CNN now, so they understand that we're effective.
[01:18:55.661 --> 01:19:03.647]  So, folks, you know, you should feel good to a certain extent that we've been able to reach as many people as we have been able to, but I appreciate your call.
[01:19:04.808 --> 01:19:05.928]  Will in Louisiana.
[01:19:05.968 --> 01:19:06.709]  Will, you're on the air.
[01:19:08.931 --> 01:19:09.051]  Hi.
[01:19:11.190 --> 01:19:12.091]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:19:12.131 --> 01:19:23.097]  What they're planning to do is take this currency loans, let's say the United States loans, Japanese, and then they pay us back that loan.
[01:19:40.792 --> 01:20:08.332]  uh... with japanese yen in their uh... exchange rate so they don't have to hold american dollars so there's no such thing as exchange rate hundreds of newspapers haven't announced that there's a world government uh... everything is fine i mean uh... you know no one's ever wanted to rule the world there are global elites uh... the council on foreign relations in literally hundreds of documents just the last few years uh... you know hasn't called for global governance i mean actually have
[01:20:09.653 --> 01:20:22.121]  But International Institutions and Global Governance Program World Order 21st Century, May 1st, 2008, with David Rockefeller saying they're going to engineer a planetary takeover by the UN by a world depression.
[01:20:22.161 --> 01:20:23.422]  I mean, that doesn't exist, sir.
[01:20:24.002 --> 01:20:30.086]  And if you think it exists, if you think the CFR exists, well, then you're an orange monkey wearing a tinfoil hat.
[01:20:30.146 --> 01:20:31.367]  That's all I can really say.
[01:20:32.321 --> 01:20:35.204]  But do you see how they don't have to hold American dollars now?
[01:20:35.244 --> 01:20:40.030]  They can just pay us back in... But see, according to the yuppies, none of this even exists.
[01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:41.792]  So why does it even matter?
[01:20:42.713 --> 01:20:44.014]  And then can I touch on one thing?
[01:20:44.034 --> 01:20:45.716]  The collateralized debt obligations?
[01:20:46.156 --> 01:20:46.757]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:20:47.618 --> 01:20:50.341]  And how they don't have to pay tax if they're a multinational.
[01:20:50.461 --> 01:20:52.784]  They're exempt from certain taxes.
[01:20:53.314 --> 01:20:55.195]  Yes.
[01:20:55.215 --> 01:20:57.296]  They pay less than 1% tax.
[01:20:57.516 --> 01:20:58.757]  Taxes are for little people.
[01:20:59.097 --> 01:21:02.358]  That's why the IRS has its investigators going after folks making 20 grand a year.
[01:21:02.698 --> 01:21:04.379]  They don't go after folks making a billion a year.
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:07.020]  Go ahead.
[01:21:08.881 --> 01:21:10.262]  Basically, that's all I wanted to touch on.
[01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:21.467]  I wanted to touch on synthetic currency loans and more information needs to be looked into on the tax structure within these derivatives and these collateralized debt obligations.
[01:21:22.796 --> 01:21:25.249]  Yeah, no, you're right, and they're all ready.
[01:21:27.122 --> 01:21:29.883]  Issuing the global currency and they admit that in major papers.
[01:21:29.943 --> 01:21:35.544]  But again, that doesn't exist according to the yuppies, who are actually a brainwashed cult of nuts.
[01:21:35.604 --> 01:21:36.744]  They're the tinfoil hat wearers.
[01:21:37.284 --> 01:21:39.625]  They believe the false reality because they're such cowards.
[01:21:40.125 --> 01:21:41.705]  And that's why they're going to lose everything they've got.
[01:21:42.185 --> 01:21:48.127]  But even when they lose everything they've got, they're such cowards, they're still going to worship the government and feel like they're members of the establishment.
[01:21:48.407 --> 01:21:51.047]  And the government's going to point them like a dangerous horde at us.
[01:21:51.207 --> 01:21:52.107]  We're on the march.
[01:21:52.588 --> 01:21:54.088]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:55.103 --> 01:21:57.790]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:01.147 --> 01:22:02.568]  So you want to stop smoking?
[01:22:02.628 --> 01:22:03.728]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[01:22:03.909 --> 01:22:06.670]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:10.612]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[01:22:10.772 --> 01:22:14.314]  And if, and only if, you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it.
[01:22:14.534 --> 01:22:16.495]  Most likely, if you tried this, you'd be arrested.
[01:22:16.555 --> 01:22:20.498]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the Smokefree Free Trial Offer is.
[01:22:20.858 --> 01:22:23.639]  Smokefree is a complete, all-natural stop smoking system.
[01:22:23.759 --> 01:22:26.461]  And when you call today, they'll send you a 30-day supply, the program,

[01:22:50.155 --> 01:22:51.735]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:23:04.443 --> 01:23:06.567]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:23:07.068 --> 01:23:14.100]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:23:14.637 --> 01:23:20.818]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:23:21.219 --> 01:23:23.059]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:23:23.199 --> 01:23:25.620]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:36.622]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:23:37.262 --> 01:23:38.563]  It's not about left or right.
[01:23:38.943 --> 01:23:40.303]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:23:40.811 --> 01:23:47.159]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:24:00.450 --> 01:24:01.971]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:24:02.151 --> 01:24:03.612]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:24:03.892 --> 01:24:06.134]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:24:06.574 --> 01:24:11.317]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:24:11.718 --> 01:24:14.579]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[01:25:05.959 --> 01:25:07.861]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:25:08.361 --> 01:25:11.163]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:25:17.568 --> 01:25:20.851]  Rob Doo, my producer, one of our producers, popping in.
[01:25:22.648 --> 01:25:29.672]  Real quick here on the show with us, and I'm going to your calls right now, here in just a moment.
[01:25:30.392 --> 01:25:31.913]  Got some key updates for folks.
[01:25:32.333 --> 01:25:39.857]  You found a 1930s newspaper editorial describing how the communists are actually in control of the banks.
[01:25:40.277 --> 01:25:42.038]  So the people knew what was going on.
[01:25:42.058 --> 01:25:43.079]  They're not really communists.
[01:25:43.099 --> 01:25:47.301]  They're criminals that tell the dumbed-down public, we're here to give you money and workers' paradise.
[01:25:47.981 --> 01:25:51.002]  And the first thing they do is steal all the money and set up a police state.
[01:25:51.482 --> 01:25:56.764]  But read for folks who are on the radio who can't see that on screen at PrisonPlanet.tv what it says.
[01:25:57.264 --> 01:26:15.770]  So it's a picture, it's an editorial cartoon and it's got a guy, his name is, I can't even read it now, but he's, they're all in Harvard type graduate uniforms and they're running down on this cart and they're shoveling money out of it and then over here, this is I guess Karl Marx, is that who that is?
[01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:16.110]  Yes, Karl Marx.
[01:26:17.050 --> 01:26:19.351]  It says, uh, plan of action for U.S.
[01:26:19.591 --> 01:26:28.872]  Spin, spin, spin under the guise of recovery, bust the government, blame the capitalists for the failure, junk the constitution, and declare a dictatorship.
[01:26:29.633 --> 01:26:38.914]  And, um, it says, uh, young, it has a thing here, it says, young pinkies from Columbia and Harvard depleting the resources of the soundest government in the world.
[01:26:38.934 --> 01:26:41.095]  And this is from, uh, 1933.
[01:26:41.415 --> 01:26:42.895]  And there it is on, on there.
[01:26:43.015 --> 01:26:43.895]  Absolutely.
[01:26:43.955 --> 01:26:45.956]  And I printed the article, it's here in my stack.
[01:26:46.716 --> 01:26:47.017]  What is it, 49%?
[01:26:47.657 --> 01:26:51.081]  I'm going from memory, let me get it.
[01:26:51.101 --> 01:26:57.388]  49% of Americans say they want socialism because they've been sold on, that means you get the rich people's money.
[01:26:57.488 --> 01:27:02.693]  No, that means the rich people, the IRS, take you if you mow lawns for a living's money.
[01:27:03.294 --> 01:27:06.496]  And that's what we just covered earlier with Professor Black.
[01:27:06.656 --> 01:27:08.397]  And they give it to offshore banks.
[01:27:08.797 --> 01:27:10.458]  And this is not socialism.
[01:27:10.958 --> 01:27:12.979]  And socialism never exists.
[01:27:13.139 --> 01:27:22.844]  Elites always, the big foundations, the big money, push it because they want to steal what you've got and feed it right into their gaping mouths.
[01:27:23.344 --> 01:27:25.725]  Guys, pull up that InfoWars.com headline.
[01:27:25.785 --> 01:27:27.986]  It's like history repeating itself.
[01:27:28.086 --> 01:27:29.007]  Yeah, it's out of a major
[01:27:29.927 --> 01:27:55.006]  A major, major polling agency did it, and 49 percent, and I love the graphic Nemo put up for the story, it's a picture, I'm going to make a t-shirt out of this, it's a picture of a guy in blue, no in red, with a gun up to a guy in blue's head who's got the bag of money in his hand, and it says socialism, that's all it is, but that's my point on that.
[01:27:55.347 --> 01:27:56.808]  Now, we've got a lot of exciting stuff happening.
[01:27:57.308 --> 01:28:10.239]  Activists, if you want to be in the new Obama film, get the Obama Deception, it is the new film right now, but on July 4th, a new Obama film is coming out, and then I'm going to take a rest from that for a while, but it's so important to discredit him and show he's a fraud, we're doing that.
[01:28:11.405 --> 01:28:14.106]  We're sending folks, and now they've asked me to speak, but I don't know if I'm going to go.
[01:28:15.006 --> 01:28:21.548]  April 19th, up at Lexington in Massachusetts, where the Revolutionary War started in 1775, with the gun confiscation.
[01:28:21.588 --> 01:28:26.149]  Today, they would just come take the guns and say, we're not taking your guns, but we're taking them.
[01:28:26.389 --> 01:28:32.231]  And the Patriots founders would have said, oh, yes, you're taking my guns at gunpoint, but you're not taking my guns.
[01:28:32.651 --> 01:28:35.814]  You know, but they weren't mind-controlled drinking fluoride then, so it wouldn't work.
[01:28:35.834 --> 01:28:38.337]  So we're going to have cameras up there, you're going to that.
[01:28:38.377 --> 01:28:39.298]  We can't be everywhere.
[01:28:39.718 --> 01:28:48.467]  Shoot video of tea parties, because I want to show the solution, the activism, while we're at it, we'll probably do a little vignette exposing Beck as an operative.
[01:28:48.947 --> 01:28:51.510]  But tell folks about some of the great ideas listeners have, and I'm going to the calls.
[01:28:51.650 --> 01:28:55.874]  Yeah, we got an email from a group in Arizona State University.
[01:28:56.054 --> 01:28:59.397]  Obama's speaking there on the 13th of May.
[01:28:59.977 --> 01:29:04.541]  And they're going to pass out, and I saw they showed the boxes of the Obama deceptions they've been copying.
[01:29:04.561 --> 01:29:07.544]  They're going to pass out 10,000 copies of the Obama deception.
[01:29:08.084 --> 01:29:10.286]  At the commencement speech, which, that's a great idea.
[01:29:10.706 --> 01:29:14.949]  Guys, and I think we're inviting, I invited the one guy who started this on the show.
[01:29:15.069 --> 01:29:15.569]  I sent him an email.
[01:29:15.589 --> 01:29:17.350]  Yeah, that will devastate them.
[01:29:18.311 --> 01:29:27.237]  And again, you can do this cheaply now, because at prisonplanet.tv, you can download DivX copies that play on almost all the new DVD players, and put the film in pretty good quality.
[01:29:27.277 --> 01:29:28.818]  It's not DVD quality, but it's close.
[01:29:29.178 --> 01:29:30.819]  You can blow up on the screen, it looks, you know, it's nice.
[01:29:31.119 --> 01:29:35.642]  It's not crystal clear like the, you know, high quality DVD folks can get, but point is, you can burn them to disk.
[01:29:36.083 --> 01:29:37.644]  Those things cost like 20 cents a piece.
[01:29:38.064 --> 01:29:39.085]  And put them in paper sleeves.
[01:29:39.325 --> 01:29:43.049]  And so what's 10,000 times 20 cents?
[01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.850]  Oh, that's $2,000?
[01:29:45.671 --> 01:29:48.574]  Is that right?
[01:29:48.594 --> 01:29:50.055]  Pretty good math.
[01:29:50.155 --> 01:29:50.836]  Yeah, you're good.
[01:29:51.496 --> 01:29:53.658]  And then more fluoride, and you stopped being able to do that.
[01:29:54.299 --> 01:29:55.040]  Okay, I was wrong.
[01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:56.061]  I knew I was going from memory.
[01:29:56.561 --> 01:29:59.864]  Just 53% say capitalism is better than socialism, so 47%
[01:30:03.834 --> 01:30:05.195]  I just need to find the poll, because I'm reading it wrong.
[01:30:05.215 --> 01:30:10.818]  The point is, only 53%, that's the headline, say capitalism better than socialism.
[01:30:11.478 --> 01:30:14.260]  That's because they're being manipulated about what socialism really means.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.821]  That's probably the people that just have jobs.
[01:30:17.001 --> 01:30:16.821]  53%.
[01:30:17.682 --> 01:30:21.984]  Anyway, also the hostage dies as French attacks Somali pirates.
[01:30:22.064 --> 01:30:24.786]  This isn't the same ship that we were talking about, but...
[01:30:26.224 --> 01:30:33.272]  A French hostage and two pirates died Friday in a rescue operation off Somali's coastline, the French President's office in Paris said Friday.
[01:30:34.333 --> 01:30:41.421]  Four hostages, including a child, were freed from the hijacked yacht after almost a week in captivity, Nicolas Sarkozy's office said.
[01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:49.313]  So they decided to move in when pirates refused their offers and one hostage died and they killed two pirates.
[01:30:49.433 --> 01:30:51.174]  So things are getting out of control.
[01:30:51.254 --> 01:30:52.455]  Okay, thank you so much, Rob.
[01:30:52.475 --> 01:30:54.796]  Do keep picking New World or Hiney there.
[01:30:55.276 --> 01:30:56.777]  Okay, who's up next here, John?
[01:30:56.797 --> 01:30:58.778]  Who should I go to next?
[01:31:01.159 --> 01:31:02.560]  Daniel in Alabama, sir.
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:02.940]  Welcome.
[01:31:05.814 --> 01:31:06.815]  He's listening to his radio.
[01:31:27.159 --> 01:31:39.883]  Oh yeah, well see they put all these rules and harassment with regulators on the ammo companies and the military has been stockpiling and hoarding way over the amount they need.
[01:31:39.923 --> 01:31:40.703]  That is confirmed.
[01:31:40.944 --> 01:31:44.585]  And the military historically would always sell the brass.
[01:31:45.345 --> 01:31:51.008]  I was reading a Liberty Hill blog and they were talking about how Congress had shut all that down.
[01:31:51.028 --> 01:31:53.450]  I don't believe that and I'm going to tell you why.
[01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:18.536]  Up here at the local Walmart, my daughter wanted to do some target shooting and she was out of shells for her 22.
[01:32:18.976 --> 01:32:21.078]  And they had told us they were going to get in a big shipment.
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:26.905]  And then three days before the shipment was supposed to come in, they tell us they cancelled it.
[01:32:27.946 --> 01:32:30.949]  I mean, it's getting that bad, you can't even get shells for a 22 down here.
[01:32:32.139 --> 01:32:35.000]  I know, and they've been denying, denying, denying.
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:37.620]  They go, we don't want your guns, and I've seen the YouTube clip.
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:39.001]  We're trying to find it earlier and couldn't.
[01:32:39.361 --> 01:32:41.481]  Somebody emailed us.
[01:32:41.501 --> 01:32:42.561]  This is what he says word for word.
[01:32:42.601 --> 01:32:45.642]  He says, listen, we're not going to ban all your guns overnight.
[01:32:46.182 --> 01:32:51.584]  We're going to do it in steps, and we have a right under the Second Amendment to restrict your gun ownership.
[01:32:51.624 --> 01:32:52.424]  That's what it means.
[01:32:53.224 --> 01:32:54.424]  I mean, I've got the video.
[01:32:54.444 --> 01:32:57.245]  I've seen it of him saying that, but regardless, we have
[01:32:58.442 --> 01:33:03.925]  We have the state law he tried to pass in Illinois to ban all handguns.
[01:33:04.625 --> 01:33:05.986]  And he supported the D.C.
[01:33:06.006 --> 01:33:07.767]  gun ban for total ban of citizens.
[01:33:08.047 --> 01:33:09.428]  And now they've introduced the bills.
[01:33:09.748 --> 01:33:12.450]  And now Pelosi says they want national registration.
[01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:16.532]  That means a fine and a fee every year to have your gun.
[01:33:16.572 --> 01:33:17.293]  It's really a fine.
[01:33:17.833 --> 01:33:21.495]  And that you've got to go through federal licensing and it turns a right into a privilege.
[01:33:21.835 --> 01:33:23.116]  They are now pushing it!
[01:33:25.194 --> 01:33:25.435]  Go ahead.
[01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:43.273]  Our own national and state parks have been deeded over to the U.N.
[01:33:43.293 --> 01:33:44.754]  They don't even belong to us anymore.
[01:33:44.794 --> 01:33:47.096]  Sir, that's Executive Order 12,986.
[01:33:47.596 --> 01:33:50.539]  I made my first film in 97 about that.
[01:33:50.659 --> 01:33:54.342]  America destroyed by design.
[01:33:54.882 --> 01:33:55.523]  And the U.N.
[01:33:55.563 --> 01:34:00.767]  came to the Kentucky legislature and told them under IMF World Bank rules that they basically were under their control.
[01:34:00.787 --> 01:34:02.929]  And the legislature said no and kicked them out.
[01:34:03.309 --> 01:34:07.813]  But now they admit, I'm sure it's been confirmed, China's demanded our lands and roads.
[01:34:08.753 --> 01:34:13.554]  for collateral on the debt, and it just came in today, that was in my stack.
[01:34:14.035 --> 01:34:24.617]  Congress did pass the bill to accompany Bush's executive order of last year to hand all the infrastructure, including the roads, over to the foreigners.
[01:34:25.158 --> 01:34:26.498]  They do this in third world nations.
[01:34:27.458 --> 01:34:32.099]  Here it is, Senate votes to end moratorium and sell off our highways to foreign toll operators.
[01:34:32.579 --> 01:34:34.040]  Bill's now going to the House.
[01:34:36.365 --> 01:34:37.886]  And this is out of the Texas Senate.
[01:34:37.906 --> 01:34:38.947]  I got another one of the Feds.
[01:34:39.748 --> 01:34:45.812]  Voted 29-2 in favor of reauthorizing private toll contracts that essentially sell our highways to the highest bidder.
[01:34:46.613 --> 01:34:47.193]  So there you go.
[01:34:47.233 --> 01:34:48.334]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:34:48.814 --> 01:34:52.477]  Yeah, and again, it's all about lying with these criminals.
[01:34:54.058 --> 01:35:02.304]  They came out two months ago and said, so people shut up at the legislative session they had, they said, look, Trans-Texas Corridor and NAFTA Highway is dead.
[01:35:02.764 --> 01:35:03.625]  AP headline.
[01:35:05.202 --> 01:35:06.522]  And then three paragraphs down.
[01:35:06.542 --> 01:35:07.843]  In fact, pull that up.
[01:35:07.923 --> 01:35:09.243]  Trans-Texas Corridor is dead.
[01:35:11.504 --> 01:35:13.504]  Dozens of publications have similar headlines.
[01:35:13.865 --> 01:35:20.927]  And then a couple paragraphs down, it says, but they're going to break the project up into subgroups and just give it new names.
[01:35:21.127 --> 01:35:22.227]  The whole thing continues.
[01:35:22.827 --> 01:35:30.269]  And then in Indiana, Texas, New Jersey, Florida, they'll take a roads that say is worth $30 billion over the next 50 years in the lease.
[01:35:30.769 --> 01:35:32.590]  They'll say, $1 billion, you get it.
[01:35:33.755 --> 01:35:39.558]  And then they run a scam where they then use taxpayer money to actually upkeep the roads, and the bankers give nothing.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:41.820]  Yeah, look at this.
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:43.661]  Trans-Texas Corridor is dead.
[01:35:43.821 --> 01:35:44.742]  Dallas Morning News.
[01:35:45.202 --> 01:35:45.662]  Click on it.
[01:35:45.882 --> 01:35:46.923]  Put it up on screen for me.
[01:35:46.963 --> 01:35:47.703]  I can read it from here.
[01:35:50.725 --> 01:35:57.149]  Dallas Morning News is loading right now on screen, and when it loads, I will, uh, there it is, loading up for everyone.
[01:35:58.339 --> 01:35:59.079]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:35:59.119 --> 01:36:01.680]  And how does it feel to be Sarah Connors?
[01:36:19.144 --> 01:36:20.024]  From the Terminator.
[01:36:20.244 --> 01:36:22.445]  You're out there trying to fight the whole thing, and it's great.
[01:36:22.565 --> 01:36:23.006]  I love it.
[01:36:23.086 --> 01:36:24.886]  I love listening to everything you've got going on here.
[01:36:25.167 --> 01:36:28.048]  Yeah, except I can't have a baby that will do it in the future.
[01:36:28.408 --> 01:36:33.390]  It's all of us out there, Sarah Connor, but we're not waiting for the Terminators to land.
[01:36:33.410 --> 01:36:33.830]  They're here.
[01:36:33.850 --> 01:36:35.491]  I got you on that.
[01:36:35.531 --> 01:36:37.672]  Hey, listen, several things.
[01:36:38.212 --> 01:36:39.413]  I was trying to reach you the other day.
[01:36:39.433 --> 01:36:41.493]  I hope you guys got it.
[01:36:42.994 --> 01:36:47.376]  When they were talking about the whole thing with the electric grid.
[01:36:48.584 --> 01:36:50.745]  That cyber thing?
[01:36:51.765 --> 01:36:56.026]  Yes, where they said they've got to control the web and be able to shut it off.
[01:36:56.046 --> 01:37:02.889]  That's the legislation, but I tried to email you the link because I couldn't believe this.
[01:37:02.929 --> 01:37:04.589]  You were on there and I was trying to call in.
[01:37:04.609 --> 01:37:09.031]  I'm a stockbroker of 22 years.
[01:37:09.051 --> 01:37:10.811]  I've been working on Wall Street for 22 years.
[01:37:11.791 --> 01:37:15.233]  At any rate, on CNBC at 12.04pm,
[01:37:16.994 --> 01:37:18.899]  They turn around and all of a sudden there's a flash.
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:26.277]  Cyber spies are in the works from either China or Russia to shut down the electric grid.
[01:37:27.307 --> 01:37:31.428]  You know, this is all in line with Rockefeller's legislation.
[01:37:31.508 --> 01:37:38.430]  No, I did see it, and they're saying that China and Russia are doing it through the internet, and so he says we must get rid of the internet.
[01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:41.910]  That's a quote from Jay Rockefeller because of this.
[01:37:42.090 --> 01:37:53.153]  And again, right as this bill is introduced, right as they're taking the web over, Mother Jones admits it, so they can kill it in their own words for our safety, the Chinese and Russians attack.
[01:37:55.892 --> 01:38:01.114]  I mean, it makes me sick because I've never believed any of this stuff to tell you the truth.
[01:38:01.154 --> 01:38:05.176]  I mean, this last July, a year ago July, I went down to Washington, D.C.
[01:38:05.216 --> 01:38:06.016]  and saw Ron Paul.
[01:38:06.036 --> 01:38:07.337]  I went down and did the march down there.
[01:38:08.357 --> 01:38:10.638]  And, you know, none of that got on the air.
[01:38:10.678 --> 01:38:12.758]  But that was pretty interesting.
[01:38:12.778 --> 01:38:19.541]  But one of the things I thought was amazing was back in, you know, September 11th when that took place.
[01:38:20.089 --> 01:38:21.229]  I worked at 1 Penn Plaza.
[01:38:21.269 --> 01:38:22.490]  I was up on the 41st floor.
[01:38:22.510 --> 01:38:24.010]  I watched the whole thing from my office.
[01:38:24.050 --> 01:38:25.371]  I couldn't believe what I saw.
[01:38:26.311 --> 01:38:29.412]  And, you know, it was like, for me, I was sitting there going, you know, I can't believe this.
[01:38:29.452 --> 01:38:31.212]  I mean, I'm walking out of the office at 11 o'clock.
[01:38:31.292 --> 01:38:33.013]  I was the last one to leave the building.
[01:38:33.493 --> 01:38:36.714]  Pushed the elevator button, and I gotta tell you, this thought popped into my head.
[01:38:36.734 --> 01:38:41.556]  And the thought was basically, here, you know, Israel's got the United States in its back pocket now.
[01:38:42.136 --> 01:38:43.136]  And that was back then.
[01:38:44.637 --> 01:38:44.857]  You know?
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:49.662]  So I was just tripped out.
[01:38:49.682 --> 01:38:51.243]  I mean, this whole thing going forward.
[01:38:51.704 --> 01:39:00.911]  And one of the other things I wanted to mention was that, you know, this whole thing with the CDOs and the collapse of the financial system that we've been witnessing here.
[01:39:00.931 --> 01:39:07.397]  I mean, you know, 22 years ago, Michael Milliken created, you know, junk bonds.
[01:39:08.898 --> 01:39:12.761]  And the junk bonds that he created 22 years ago literally
[01:39:13.806 --> 01:39:21.252]  You know, wiped out the savings and loans, the thrift, the insurance companies, etc., etc., all the way up and took the market down from 87 to 91.
[01:39:23.113 --> 01:39:25.175]  This stuff that's going on today, it's the same thing.
[01:39:26.495 --> 01:39:27.076]  It's no different.
[01:39:28.678 --> 01:39:44.066]  Absolutely, and by engaging in the financial terrorism, saying we were going to have a depression, that destroyed confidence and then hit all the legitimate real stocks, so they can depress it and suck it up, and they write white papers about how they do this.
[01:39:44.106 --> 01:39:51.409]  What's happening here now, Alex, is that, if you go back to Michael Milken, okay, to me, that was like a test balloon.
[01:39:52.170 --> 01:39:53.991]  You know, it was like, here, let's see if this works.
[01:39:54.811 --> 01:39:56.692]  You know, let's throw this out there, let's see if this works.
[01:39:57.270 --> 01:40:05.055]  And they thought that it did work, and now it's like, you know, 22 years later, they turn around and say, okay, here, we're going to come up with these CDOs, CDSs, etc., etc., etc.
[01:40:05.075 --> 01:40:19.825]  We're going to sell them all around the world, and basically what that is, is I don't know if you're familiar with the collateralized mortgage obligation, but the bottom line is that what these guys would do is they take a loan, and then they break it up into various different pieces, or what's known as tranches.
[01:40:20.366 --> 01:40:25.169]  And they claim it has value, and they claim it's certified, and sell it as an asset when it's a debt.
[01:40:26.067 --> 01:40:26.647]  Imagine this.
[01:40:27.108 --> 01:40:29.429]  What they did, they went another step further.
[01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:34.273]  Now they turn around and they do fractional banking on all these assets.
[01:40:34.533 --> 01:40:35.194]  Oh yeah, I know.
[01:40:35.214 --> 01:40:41.198]  They sell them, repackage them, sell them, repackage them, sell them, repackage them, sell them, repackage them, over and over and over again.
[01:40:41.698 --> 01:40:47.002]  So you're not talking about, you know, a $1 trillion problem, a $12 trillion problem.
[01:40:48.373 --> 01:40:52.496]  Some of the numbers I've seen are like a quadrillion and a half dollars.
[01:40:53.117 --> 01:41:13.992]  No, that's what the experts we've talked to have said, because they would leverage banks and insurance companies and everybody engaging in fractional reserve banking, and create new banks with seed money from that, and then they would leverage, leverage, leverage, leverage, leverage seven times, and then leverage, leverage, leverage, and create another bank, and then leverage, leverage, leverage, leverage, and then they buy up the planet and then say, you're our slaves now!
[01:41:14.292 --> 01:41:14.933]  SWAT teams!
[01:41:15.173 --> 01:41:15.874]  They're our slaves!
[01:41:15.914 --> 01:41:17.495]  And the cops go, that's right!
[01:41:17.975 --> 01:41:19.216]  Bankers say they have the money.
[01:41:19.436 --> 01:41:20.257]  Good to hear from you, sir.
[01:41:20.277 --> 01:41:21.177]  Really appreciate it, Bill.
[01:41:22.038 --> 01:41:23.519]  Let's talk to Matt in Texas.
[01:41:23.579 --> 01:41:24.360]  Matt, you're on the air.
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:24.760]  Welcome.
[01:41:27.522 --> 01:41:28.103]  Who again?
[01:41:28.643 --> 01:41:29.304]  Yes, Matt.
[01:41:29.404 --> 01:41:30.084]  Welcome to the show.
[01:41:30.104 --> 01:41:30.424]  All right.
[01:41:30.524 --> 01:41:32.626]  Okay.
[01:41:32.746 --> 01:41:34.327]  I had a question.
[01:41:35.408 --> 01:41:36.929]  You know, the tea parties and everything.
[01:41:39.211 --> 01:41:41.593]  Well, I've gotten into that a little.
[01:41:42.921 --> 01:41:46.923]  We call ours Americans for Integrity and Government.
[01:41:47.243 --> 01:41:48.084]  Oh, that sounds evil.
[01:41:49.124 --> 01:41:49.824]  That sounds evil?
[01:41:50.185 --> 01:41:51.045]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:41:51.145 --> 01:41:51.585]  Oh, yeah.
[01:41:51.765 --> 01:41:52.206]  Freedom.
[01:41:52.226 --> 01:41:52.906]  Integrity.
[01:41:53.006 --> 01:41:53.606]  Oh, my God.
[01:41:55.107 --> 01:41:56.207]  The government doesn't like that.
[01:41:56.227 --> 01:42:02.671]  But, you know, we are so far behind in education, I think, in what we know.
[01:42:03.591 --> 01:42:11.095]  As far as, you know, Republican, Democrat, we're pitted against each other and I just
[01:42:14.452 --> 01:42:27.563]  I'm kind of, I'd like to be able to offer a way to be educated and take action at the same time.
[01:42:27.903 --> 01:42:29.044]  That's what we want to do.
[01:42:29.304 --> 01:42:41.434]  And these people, I would say most of them are Republicans, but we're trying not to be a Republican.
[01:42:43.605 --> 01:42:44.707]  I agree, that's healthy.
[01:42:44.727 --> 01:42:48.672]  Well, I mean, you know, it was mostly Democrats against Bush and now it's mostly Republicans against Obama.
[01:42:48.992 --> 01:42:50.915]  It's the partisanship in its very nature.
[01:42:51.896 --> 01:42:55.321]  But we've got to, that's what the Obama deception does, is it shows you they're all paid for.
[01:42:55.561 --> 01:42:56.802]  We've got to arrest the bankers.
[01:42:57.223 --> 01:42:57.904]  That's the key.
[01:42:58.144 --> 01:42:58.965]  You want a solution?
[01:42:59.306 --> 01:43:00.067]  Arrest the crooks.
[01:43:01.909 --> 01:43:07.133]  With our economy spiraling out of control, living in the soup kitchens may be right around the corner.
[01:43:07.434 --> 01:43:09.135]  No one saw the financial collapse of 1929.
[01:43:10.456 --> 01:43:16.001]  Many didn't make it, and millions ended up in soup lines, becoming vagrants, begging for food.
[01:43:16.661 --> 01:43:20.084]  Unlike 1929, we can see this collapse coming.
[01:43:20.324 --> 01:43:21.425]  We have been warned.
[01:43:21.626 --> 01:43:27.751]  And right now, we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into our homes before it's too late.
[01:43:28.610 --> 01:43:31.760]  Why is the Canadian government telling their citizens to stock up?
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:32.121]  Why?
[01:43:32.241 --> 01:43:36.033]  And why are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage?
[01:43:37.788 --> 01:43:44.112]  Having food storage today may be just as important to your family's survival as boarding the Ark was in the days of Noah.

[01:44:00.201 --> 01:44:06.805]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:07.578 --> 01:44:12.943]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:44:13.463 --> 01:44:19.668]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:19.968 --> 01:44:21.790]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:21.930 --> 01:44:24.332]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:44:24.392 --> 01:44:35.301]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:44:37.572 --> 01:44:38.853]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:39.253 --> 01:44:40.654]  It's about a one world government.
[01:44:41.095 --> 01:44:47.459]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:44:56.286 --> 01:44:57.427]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:57.847 --> 01:44:59.108]  The people strike back.
[01:45:00.910 --> 01:45:01.390]  You worry.
[01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:03.516]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:45:03.856 --> 01:45:06.078]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:45:06.498 --> 01:45:08.319]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:09.840]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:45:10.241 --> 01:45:13.423]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:45:13.823 --> 01:45:18.706]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:45:19.066 --> 01:45:22.389]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:45:23.049 --> 01:45:24.390]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:45:24.730 --> 01:45:27.332]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[01:45:27.632 --> 01:45:30.574]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:45:31.072 --> 01:45:39.258]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:45:39.718 --> 01:45:44.101]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[01:45:44.541 --> 01:45:48.244]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.

[01:45:52.527 --> 01:45:53.948]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:45:53.968 --> 01:45:55.689]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[01:46:08.695 --> 01:46:13.856]  I'm very thankful to all the listeners tuning in and hearing all the guests, the information, and also putting up with me.
[01:46:19.518 --> 01:46:23.459]  You know, I'm normally been a lot calmer the last few months on air.
[01:46:25.592 --> 01:46:26.853]  But I'm kind of a loser in ways.
[01:46:26.893 --> 01:46:29.594]  I go back and forth smoking cigarettes, not smoking cigarettes.
[01:46:30.214 --> 01:46:34.616]  And the problem is, every time I quit smoking cigarettes and start really exercising a lot, I get crazed.
[01:46:35.197 --> 01:46:36.377]  Even more than normal.
[01:46:36.417 --> 01:46:38.158]  So I've been like that lately.
[01:46:38.738 --> 01:46:41.560]  I'm gonna go jogging right now when I get off air to hopefully settle down.
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:45.502]  So that's one reason I've been a little bit more obnoxious lately this week.
[01:46:45.522 --> 01:46:47.142]  But I know it's made for interesting radio listening.
[01:46:47.162 --> 01:46:49.364]  But, you know, this stuff is so real, folks.
[01:46:50.484 --> 01:46:51.645]  It's hard to get your mind around.
[01:46:51.665 --> 01:46:52.425]  It's hard to deal with.
[01:46:52.905 --> 01:46:54.386]  I'm going to take a few final calls.
[01:46:54.426 --> 01:46:57.548]  I'm tempted to go into overdrive, just so we can take all the calls that are here.
[01:46:58.128 --> 01:46:58.948]  But I'm not going to do it.
[01:46:58.988 --> 01:47:01.630]  We'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., and of course back on Monday.
[01:47:01.670 --> 01:47:04.611]  And remember, this show grows because you spread the word about it.
[01:47:04.931 --> 01:47:06.112]  And as we reach more people...
[01:47:06.892 --> 01:47:10.914]  As we educate more people, we have a better chance of bringing these criminals to justice.
[01:47:11.414 --> 01:47:14.275]  Again, it's very bold and criminal what the globalists are doing.
[01:47:14.835 --> 01:47:24.740]  And if we can just get the folks to realize they have power and that they have a chance to affect things, and that their interest is to stand up and say no, and get past the left-right distraction, we can fix this.
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:29.021]  One of the sponsors I wanted to tell you about was Pepperspray.com.
[01:47:30.362 --> 01:47:34.684]  Just great prices, huge selection, been around since 94 on the web.
[01:47:36.021 --> 01:47:37.082]  Pepperspray.com.
[01:47:37.102 --> 01:47:37.622]  That's one word.
[01:47:37.662 --> 01:47:38.603]  Pepperspray.com or 800-908-9988.
[01:47:38.623 --> 01:47:38.663]  800-908-9988.
[01:47:45.290 --> 01:47:50.411]  We got stun guns and tasers, animal repellents, home safety, personal alarms, and a lot more.
[01:47:51.132 --> 01:47:55.633]  Don't forget acolablue.com, the best atmospheric water generator out there, bar none.
[01:47:56.213 --> 01:48:00.114]  Sends it through seven filters after it grabs the water out of the air, seven and a half gallons a day.
[01:48:00.134 --> 01:48:03.975]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com, acolablue.com, or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043, acolablue.com.
[01:48:11.437 --> 01:48:12.578]  Calm, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:12.938 --> 01:48:14.119]  Just fabulous system.
[01:48:14.139 --> 01:48:16.020]  Check out the banners at InfoWars.com.
[01:48:16.721 --> 01:48:17.782]  I'll take one more call.
[01:48:17.922 --> 01:48:18.902]  Should we go into overdrive?
[01:48:19.283 --> 01:48:20.744]  But then I gotta have them call the other numbers.
[01:48:20.784 --> 01:48:21.744]  We're in the other studio.
[01:48:22.465 --> 01:48:26.868]  And then, as we decouple from the mothership in Minneapolis-St.
[01:48:26.888 --> 01:48:29.350]  Paul, and we're just out of our little operation.
[01:48:29.810 --> 01:48:31.131]  But I wanna get to all these people.
[01:48:32.852 --> 01:48:33.673]  Uh, who's up next?
[01:48:33.693 --> 01:48:34.773]  Who was up next, John?
[01:48:36.495 --> 01:48:37.575]  Josh in North Carolina.
[01:48:37.595 --> 01:48:38.076]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:48:39.107 --> 01:48:40.128]  Hey, Alex.
[01:48:40.788 --> 01:48:42.290]  Good to be speaking with you again.
[01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:48.835]  So, I have several things that are actually of very high importance on the list that I want to bring up.
[01:48:49.255 --> 01:48:58.603]  I think I'm going to start off with the first being the NIAC document, which has been posted to the Prison Planet Forum by one of the moderators known as Anti-Illuminati.
[01:48:58.623 --> 01:49:08.051]  Now, being that... Well, I mean, we have the MIAC report, and we... Not MIAC, not in M, N. The National
[01:49:08.601 --> 01:49:09.322]  The N.A.S.
[01:49:09.522 --> 01:49:11.463]  Information Architecture Committee.
[01:49:11.483 --> 01:49:13.244]  This report is the
[01:49:18.490 --> 01:49:29.379]  Exact detailed report of how they integrated the DOD's systems directly with the FAA, okay?
[01:49:29.639 --> 01:49:35.864]  So that it went from being a one-way communication terminal in which they could only pull data to being able to push data.
[01:49:36.264 --> 01:49:38.586]  The culmination of this project
[01:49:38.966 --> 01:49:51.012]  And the sheer importance of this was demonstrated in Loose Change 2nd Edition when NASA flies that jet by remote control over ILS, and after landing it and taking it off,
[01:49:51.753 --> 01:50:02.918]  Um, is able to then use this system to completely get rid of all of the security and safety mechanisms in place in ILS to crash the planes.
[01:50:02.938 --> 01:50:03.698]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:50:03.738 --> 01:50:04.938]  Yes, I was aware.
[01:50:04.959 --> 01:50:07.620]  Remember when Bush was in a press conference in New York?
[01:50:08.180 --> 01:50:09.961]  And he says, hey, don't worry, no more hijackers.
[01:50:09.981 --> 01:50:13.662]  We got a remote control system that'll be able to, we'll be able to stop the planes.
[01:50:13.702 --> 01:50:17.924]  And he literally, the guy by him grabs his arm and he's like, stop it, puppet.
[01:50:18.644 --> 01:50:19.905]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:46.574 --> 01:50:49.537]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:50.818 --> 01:50:51.419]  Hello, friends.
[01:50:51.459 --> 01:50:52.420]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:57.124]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:57.264 --> 01:51:00.027]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:51:00.227 --> 01:51:03.089]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:51:03.269 --> 01:51:09.115]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:51:09.335 --> 01:51:12.298]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:12.578 --> 01:51:19.464]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:51:19.564 --> 01:51:22.707]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:51:22.847 --> 01:51:24.729]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:51:27.992 --> 01:51:34.057]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.

[01:51:39.541 --> 01:51:39.981]  Take action today.
[01:51:40.001 --> 01:51:41.983]  The first step is getting scorable food.
