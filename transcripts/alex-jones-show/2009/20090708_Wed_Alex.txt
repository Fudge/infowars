[00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:03.390]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.812]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:21.262 --> 00:00:24.564]  All right, it's Wednesday, July 8, 2009.
[00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:32.367]  And with us, five minutes into the next hour, so full hour of transmission time here, Dr. Bob Bowman.
[00:00:33.647 --> 00:00:36.709]  He's a former Director of Advanced Space Programs Development for the U.S.
[00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:44.132]  Air Force in the Ford and Carter Administrations and a former United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel with 101 Combat Missions.
[00:00:44.452 --> 00:00:49.274]  He holds a PhD in Aeronautics and Nuclear Engineering from the California Institute of Technology.
[00:00:50.274 --> 00:00:59.297]  And it goes, despite his involvement with space programs and defense, he emerged as an early public critic of the Strategic Defense Initiative because it was a decapitation offensive weapon system.
[00:00:59.737 --> 00:01:10.880]  During the Ronald Reagan administration and on the MacLeod News Hour, he called it the ultimate military lunacy, easily overwhelmed and vulnerable, only good as a first strike.
[00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:17.682]  Bowman founded the Institute for Space and Security Studies and its publication Space and Security News in 1983.
[00:01:19.623 --> 00:01:22.166]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:01:22.206 --> 00:01:36.639]  He's an author, researcher, he's been active in Veterans for Peace, Vietnam Veterans Against the War, Episcopal Diocese of Washington, Project Censored winner, as well as San Francisco Bay Guardian.
[00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:39.471]  And he just goes on and on.
[00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:43.433]  He's also worked on depleted uranium during and after the Gulf War.
[00:01:43.553 --> 00:01:45.833]  And he's run for Congress and President.
[00:01:46.274 --> 00:01:49.015]  And, of course, our historic C-SPAN live event.
[00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:52.816]  I couldn't believe it when C-SPAN said we're going to carry your event out in Los Angeles.
[00:01:53.376 --> 00:01:55.817]  I guess Charlie Sheen being involved excited them.
[00:01:56.657 --> 00:01:57.737]  So that was one of the first big 9-11 truths.
[00:01:59.858 --> 00:02:02.021]  It's good to have Dr. Bob Bowman in with us for the next hour.
[00:02:16.841 --> 00:02:19.923]  Biden saying, hey, Israel, green light, go ahead and hit Iran.
[00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:21.344]  Where do you see that going?
[00:02:21.764 --> 00:02:23.866]  Really, the whole two-party system.
[00:02:23.886 --> 00:02:35.113]  Do you agree with me that we've got to shatter this whole left-right idea because the power structure just keeps sharing power between the false left and right, and so we never really get a true revolution or change?
[00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:37.975]  I mean, you told me you've seen the Obama deception.
[00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:40.417]  What's your take on the whole state of affairs?
[00:02:40.737 --> 00:02:42.939]  OK, well, I agree with you absolutely.
[00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.840]  And what I've been doing for about the last
[00:02:47.401 --> 00:03:02.128]  Oh, nine years is trying to shatter this left-right division, because we, the American people, have been artificially divided by the powers that be, the global elite, the global robber barons, if you will.
[00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:07.370]  They have artificially divided us into liberal and conservative.
[00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:17.060]  They've taken their one party and divided it into two parts and split up the hot button issues.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.803]  You know, you guys be for abortion, you guys be for against it.
[00:03:19.843 --> 00:03:21.945]  You guys be for gun control, you be against it.
[00:03:22.186 --> 00:03:24.168]  You be for school prayer, you be against it.
[00:03:25.265 --> 00:03:39.556]  The thing that makes all of those issues in common, besides the fact that the federal government probably has no business mucking around with them in the first place, is that the global elite could care less how it comes out.
[00:03:40.096 --> 00:03:42.738]  Those issues do not affect their bottom line.
[00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:45.300]  So, they really don't care.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.763]  They don't care which party wins in general.
[00:03:49.903 --> 00:03:51.645]  Ever since John F. Kennedy,
[00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:05.171]  Every nominee of both the Republican and Democratic parties has been a member of the Trilateral Commission and handpicked by them for the nomination of their party.
[00:04:06.232 --> 00:04:12.598]  JFK was the last nominee of either party not to be a member of the Trilateral Commission.
[00:04:12.638 --> 00:04:13.819]  Of course, we know what happened to him.
[00:04:15.467 --> 00:04:18.088]  We have to end this artificial division.
[00:04:19.028 --> 00:04:26.692]  We have to bring the American people together, left and right, and we've been very successful in that in the last few years.
[00:04:27.332 --> 00:04:34.775]  Many of the events on my speaking tour each year are co-sponsored by the Green Party and the Libertarian Party.
[00:04:35.215 --> 00:04:39.917]  They're co-sponsored by the Ron Paul meetups and the Dennis Kucinich meetups.
[00:04:39.937 --> 00:04:42.218]  I mean, this is really coming together.
[00:04:43.374 --> 00:04:44.376]  And it's working.
[00:04:44.696 --> 00:04:48.101]  And these people are recognizing that they have common interests.
[00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:52.026]  That both the left and the right have been alienated
[00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:58.616]  And mistreated by our government and the powers that be.
[00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:15.186]  Well, I want to get into some solutions and also talk about what's happening in the current world and your view on Barack Obama, but addressing the viewers out there, Bob, can you explain to them how the two-party system became this divide-and-conquer mechanism?
[00:05:15.226 --> 00:05:21.931]  Because people still email me and call me and say, now explain to me how the two parties are controlled, or explain to me no matter who gets in office,
[00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:25.533]  The consolidation of power happens, the corporate looting happens.
[00:05:26.394 --> 00:05:27.655]  I mean, break that down for folks.
[00:05:28.055 --> 00:05:31.038]  Well, I mean, it goes way back to the time of Thomas Jefferson.
[00:05:31.078 --> 00:05:33.280]  He warned us about the power of corporations.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:44.309]  And Teddy Roosevelt did it, and on and on, right through Dwight David Eisenhower, who warned us about the military-industrial complex, which is essentially the same thing.
[00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:58.855]  Now, the whole problem got a lot worse in the 19th century when the railroad somehow got a Supreme Court justice to talk about corporate personhood.
[00:05:59.756 --> 00:06:13.842]  And the myth of corporate personhood has gone on to this day and has been parlayed by the corporations into a First Amendment free speech right to spend as much money as they want
[00:06:14.795 --> 00:06:15.495]  We're good to go.
[00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:40.786]  got rid of the FCC ban on ownership of multiple media outlets and allowed these media conglomerates to get a monopoly.
[00:06:41.707 --> 00:06:51.832]  Until now, we've got almost every major media outlet being controlled
[00:06:53.075 --> 00:07:10.261]  by six multinational corporations with interlocking boards of directors, all of which are in bed with the weapons manufacturers, the oil companies, and all the others who are running things.
[00:07:12.082 --> 00:07:17.524]  And because of that, they collude every four years
[00:07:19.042 --> 00:07:32.187]  To work with the Trilateralists and Bilderbergers and Council on Foreign Relations to make sure that their hand-picked nominees get the nomination of the Republican and Democratic parties.
[00:07:32.267 --> 00:07:36.889]  And once they can do that, then they don't care who wins the general election.
[00:07:36.929 --> 00:07:38.850]  They know one of their guys is going to get it.
[00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.691]  It's a choice between Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
[00:07:42.811 --> 00:07:45.572]  In some cases, Tweedledum and Tweedledummer.
[00:07:47.992 --> 00:07:49.613]  That's how they do it, essentially.
[00:07:49.953 --> 00:07:54.536]  And then Congress, of course, who the Constitution really gives the power to.
[00:07:55.236 --> 00:08:11.786]  Congress has been bought and paid for by the K Street lobbyists, the corporate lobbyists, to the point where almost all the members of Congress, with the exception of people like Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich and a few others,
[00:08:12.731 --> 00:08:27.215]  Almost all of them are bought and paid for and have abdicated their responsibility to Dick Cheney's invention of the Unitary Executive, in other words, the Imperial Presidency.
[00:08:27.555 --> 00:08:33.777]  And since they have their guy under their thumb in the Presidency, the Congress becomes immaterial.
[00:08:36.846 --> 00:08:41.929]  So what you have is our government under direct control of the corporations.
[00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:45.171]  We have energy policy being made by Enron.
[00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:51.755]  We have agricultural policy being made by Archer Daniels, Midland, and Monsanto.
[00:08:52.235 --> 00:08:55.257]  Defense policy being made by the weapons manufacturers.
[00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:56.438]  It goes on and on.
[00:08:56.618 --> 00:08:59.740]  Almost every regulatory agency in the government
[00:09:01.209 --> 00:09:07.618]  is headed by an executive of the corporations that they're supposed to regulate so
[00:09:09.372 --> 00:09:17.660]  We have complete corporate control of government at the highest levels, and that's exactly what Benito Mussolini defined as fascism.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:31.574]  And now, and I wanted to ask you about this, and you can repeat that, I've interrupted you, or add any points, now that they use so-called free market terms and freedom of speech to rig the game and buy everything up and consolidate,
[00:09:32.274 --> 00:09:49.221]  uh... and and create these oligopolies or these cartels working there as a monopoly i guess monopoly monopoly capitalism be the term now they're doing a mopping up operation in the name of stopping extremist and racism having free speech that the house has passed the hate crimes bill
[00:09:49.781 --> 00:10:00.287]  That actually states if the government says you hurt somebody's feelings or what you said might lead to someone doing something violent, even if you didn't call for it, I've never seen a hate crime bill this strong.
[00:10:00.787 --> 00:10:02.348]  That has now passed the House.
[00:10:02.708 --> 00:10:04.990]  The cyberbullying thing says the same deal.
[00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.112]  We have the New York Times saying we need internet gatekeepers.
[00:10:08.472 --> 00:10:15.756]  We need to, the CEO, Murdoch's CEO said two days ago, arrest bloggers, put them in jail.
[00:10:16.356 --> 00:10:18.097]  So they're saying we don't get any free speech.
[00:10:18.157 --> 00:10:18.558]  So now,
[00:10:19.818 --> 00:10:28.225]  That we're actually getting an alternative voice and challenging them, now that their hypocrisy and imperial hubris is so obvious, they're moving to block our free speech.
[00:10:28.285 --> 00:10:31.527]  Can you comment on the Empire's consolidation?
[00:10:32.348 --> 00:10:33.229]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:10:33.249 --> 00:10:47.460]  And, you know, the height of this fascist hypocrisy is Glenn Beck saying that 9-11 truthers are terrorists out to destroy this country.
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:11:01.068]  By God, the 9-11 truthers are essential to saving this country because of all the evil that has been done in the name of 9-11 and is still being done in the name of 9-11.
[00:11:01.248 --> 00:11:15.897]  You know, there are people out there who know that the Bush administration's official conspiracy theory on 9-11 was total hogwash, but they say, well, that's ancient history and, you know, who cares?
[00:11:17.165 --> 00:11:30.500]  They have to understand that even President Obama is out there expanding the war in Afghanistan, putting the war into Pakistan, and blaming it on 9-11.
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.845]  So, until we destroy the government myth,
[00:11:35.976 --> 00:11:41.897]  And get some real truth out there, the evil will continue no matter who is president.
[00:11:42.137 --> 00:11:50.619]  And I think that's the message we need to get out there to the truth community, that they are absolutely essential and they must not give up.
[00:11:50.739 --> 00:11:53.660]  Senator Bob Bowman got a break, come back and complete that statement.
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.460]  I mean, I really agree with what you're saying.
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.201]  Presidents come and go, the shadow government remains the same.
[00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:02.871]  Recognize that sound?
[00:12:03.171 --> 00:12:07.734]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in pill form, that's exactly where many are ending up.
[00:12:07.975 --> 00:12:10.116]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[00:12:10.416 --> 00:12:15.520]  According to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:20.884]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, that's $90 you're flushing down the toilet.
[00:12:21.144 --> 00:12:24.306]  In fact, orderlies at hospitals call these bedpan bullets.
[00:12:24.586 --> 00:12:26.728]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.

[00:13:49.088 --> 00:13:49.988]  A new world order.
[00:13:50.148 --> 00:13:53.830]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.151]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:13:55.231 --> 00:13:57.852]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:13:57.872 --> 00:14:00.593]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:14:18.277 --> 00:14:25.609]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:14:28.632 --> 00:14:33.615]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:14:34.096 --> 00:14:37.558]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.420]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.661]  Most people have no idea.
[00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:42.461]  They're not after money.
[00:14:42.481 --> 00:14:43.542]  They have all the money they need.
[00:14:43.742 --> 00:14:44.443]  They're after power.
[00:14:44.483 --> 00:14:45.563]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:16:06.264 --> 00:16:11.129]  Dr. Bob Bowman is our guest.
[00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.193]  Time flies when you've got a great political mind like this with you.
[00:16:16.894 --> 00:16:22.439]  We're going to be talking to a pastor who's fighting against the hate crimes bill in the next hour.
[00:16:23.059 --> 00:16:24.821]  So I wanted to have you finish your thought.
[00:16:24.841 --> 00:16:27.704]  We were talking during the break about Teddy Roosevelt's quote.
[00:16:27.724 --> 00:16:30.726]  So can you repeat what we were discussing here privately?
[00:16:31.687 --> 00:16:33.289]  I mean, now they've consolidated their power.
[00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:35.611]  Now it's obvious the Federal Reserve's private.
[00:16:35.651 --> 00:16:44.580]  We have this banking Wall Street Goldman Sachs, you know, holding shares in the New York Fed openly with their former executive feeding them all the money.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.863]  I mean, now the public is really starting to get mad and wake up.
[00:16:48.183 --> 00:16:51.146]  And now we're hearing, oh, NORTHCOM's going to have troops on the streets.
[00:16:51.686 --> 00:16:54.509]  Oh, now we're going to have local CIA offices.
[00:16:54.709 --> 00:16:55.710]  Oh, I mean, this is...
[00:16:56.832 --> 00:17:02.585]  A cross between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in my view, so I want you to speak to the whole police state as well, but this attack on the First Amendment.
[00:17:03.496 --> 00:17:09.000]  Yeah, well, the First Amendment is designed to protect we the people, the dissenters.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.601]  That's what it's about.
[00:17:11.001 --> 00:17:19.668]  It's not designed to protect the people who are defending government actions, it's designed to protect those of us who are criticizing the government.
[00:17:20.368 --> 00:17:26.953]  That's what the Founding Fathers planned, that's what all of our great
[00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:40.651]  Statesmen have said, Teddy Roosevelt, great Republican president, great fighter of the corporations, said that dissent is the highest form of patriotism.
[00:17:41.292 --> 00:17:50.379]  By the way, that's one reason why I've renamed our organization from the Institute for Space and Security Studies to the Patriots.
[00:17:52.642 --> 00:18:10.731]  The organization is the same 501c3 that's been going on for 27 years, whistleblowing and myth-busting and telling the truth, but now the name is The Patriots, has been for the last couple years, and our website is thepatriots.us.
[00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:17.414]  There's a lot of us in this country involved in truth-telling.
[00:18:17.894 --> 00:18:18.935]  You're one of the greatest.
[00:18:20.775 --> 00:18:21.676]  We are the ones
[00:18:22.682 --> 00:18:25.531]  That the First Amendment was written to protect.
[00:18:28.439 --> 00:18:33.120]  So it's there for not just unpopular speech, but popular speech.
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:36.581]  I mean, we're with the Constitution, Bill of Rights, most polls agree with us.
[00:18:36.641 --> 00:18:39.301]  It's not that it's even for unpopular speech, though it protects that as well.
[00:18:39.621 --> 00:18:41.661]  It's for the speech the establishment doesn't like.
[00:18:41.882 --> 00:18:43.222]  That's right, that's right.
[00:18:43.802 --> 00:18:54.764]  If you look at Project Censored, for example, every year they repeat 25 stories which have been self-censored out by the corporate monopoly media.
[00:18:55.604 --> 00:19:03.592]  And the thing that ties those all together, the thing they have in common, is not sloppy journalism or carelessness.
[00:19:04.113 --> 00:19:09.718]  It's that those 25 stories are dangerous to the establishment.
[00:19:10.419 --> 00:19:18.727]  They break the myths by which the corporate government fascist entity
[00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:28.160]  Controls the people, brainwashes them, and keeps them docile and ignorant.
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:29.942]  You got interrupted by the break.
[00:19:29.962 --> 00:19:37.751]  You were talking about how important it is to break the 9-11 myth because so much of the tyranny we're now living under has been built on that openly.
[00:19:38.431 --> 00:19:54.541]  Bush and now Obama are publicly switching the entire apparatus of Homeland Security and NORTHCOM around, saying, oh, it's for gun owners, it's for liberals, it's for libertarians, it's for animal rights activists, it's for land rights activists, and these federal reports list everybody!
[00:19:54.861 --> 00:20:03.665]  Basically, anybody who's politically active in any way is spied on and now they admit the Department of Defense has regular army spying on Ron Paul and myself.
[00:20:03.705 --> 00:20:04.626]  We got the documents.
[00:20:04.906 --> 00:20:10.349]  And they go to end the Fed protests and they're spying on peaceful peace activists at Cookie Bakes.
[00:20:10.749 --> 00:20:12.270]  I mean, they're spying on everybody.
[00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:13.730]  Aren't they the terrorists?
[00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:14.871]  Isn't that anti-American?
[00:20:15.171 --> 00:20:16.132]  Well, of course it is.
[00:20:16.412 --> 00:20:17.112]  Of course it is.
[00:20:17.893 --> 00:20:24.977]  And that's why we've got to insist, all of us, that we are the patriots.
[00:20:26.098 --> 00:20:27.539]  We are the patriots.
[00:20:27.979 --> 00:20:29.500]  They are the terrorists.
[00:20:31.321 --> 00:20:36.465]  Those in and around our government are the terrorists.
[00:20:37.831 --> 00:20:46.436]  And there are a lot of people out there, a lot of my buddies, retired military officers,
[00:20:47.472 --> 00:20:56.896]  Who know a lot of the truth, but they're intimidated because they want to be patriotic, so they support the government.
[00:20:57.357 --> 00:20:58.017]  Baloney!
[00:20:58.597 --> 00:21:00.918]  Supporting the government is not what's patriotic.
[00:21:01.439 --> 00:21:02.439]  It's doing what's right.
[00:21:02.779 --> 00:21:07.301]  It's following the Constitution, honoring the truth, serving the people.
[00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:09.282]  Our government does not do that.
[00:21:09.722 --> 00:21:11.543]  We are the ones that are doing that.
[00:21:11.803 --> 00:21:12.924]  We are the patriots.
[00:21:13.464 --> 00:21:14.605]  They are the terrorists.
[00:21:15.265 --> 00:21:29.578]  Well, I hate to use the overused Hitler parallel, but so much parallels that the German military, which had a lot of esprit de corps and a great past, they got beguiled and sold out thinking patriotism was following Hitler.
[00:21:30.299 --> 00:21:34.281]  Instead of patriotism, is really what Operation Valkyrie tried to do, saying no.
[00:21:34.421 --> 00:21:39.104]  But this New World Order system isn't in one man and a fewer, it's a system.
[00:21:39.124 --> 00:21:44.407]  I want to talk about the architecture of the New World Order, what's happening with Obama, and a lot more when we get back.
[00:21:44.447 --> 00:21:46.709]  Long segment coming up with Bob Bowman.
[00:21:46.729 --> 00:21:48.009]  Stay with us.
[00:21:50.411 --> 00:21:51.311]  We're on the march.
[00:21:51.792 --> 00:21:53.413]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:54.333 --> 00:21:57.015]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:59.895 --> 00:22:05.437]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[00:22:05.737 --> 00:22:06.898]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:22:07.038 --> 00:22:11.039]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[00:22:11.319 --> 00:22:12.880]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:19.483]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[00:22:20.623 --> 00:22:23.164]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[00:22:23.484 --> 00:22:24.965]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[00:22:25.225 --> 00:22:28.006]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[00:22:28.247 --> 00:22:29.667]  And their formula really works.
[00:22:29.947 --> 00:22:32.489]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[00:22:32.769 --> 00:22:34.029]  Try the Nutri-Cafe.
[00:22:34.249 --> 00:22:38.691]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boost the immune system.
[00:22:39.032 --> 00:22:41.233]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[00:22:41.453 --> 00:22:43.714]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[00:22:43.914 --> 00:22:45.655]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[00:22:45.995 --> 00:22:47.115]  Go to www.
[00:22:49.016 --> 00:22:51.337]  We're good to go.
[00:22:59.946 --> 00:23:04.909]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:23:29.906 --> 00:23:30.046]  I think?
[00:23:59.494 --> 00:24:00.595]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:24:00.875 --> 00:24:02.656]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:24:02.856 --> 00:24:03.476]  Well, you should.
[00:24:03.496 --> 00:24:08.079]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:24:08.339 --> 00:24:08.819]  That's right.
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:17.604]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:24:17.784 --> 00:24:19.045]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:24:19.165 --> 00:24:20.306]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:24:20.506 --> 00:24:26.129]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:33.014]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:24:33.374 --> 00:24:38.577]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:24:38.897 --> 00:24:40.057]  This is real.
[00:24:40.358 --> 00:24:41.118]  Don't miss out.

[00:25:08.226 --> 00:25:10.808]  Your own personal Jesus.
[00:25:23.886 --> 00:25:28.289]  More other great discussions behind the scenes with Dr. Bob Bowman.
[00:25:28.629 --> 00:25:29.409]  And I know we got Rev.
[00:25:29.449 --> 00:25:31.010]  Ted Pike hunting about the hate crime bill.
[00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:34.692]  We'll have him on about 15 after, so let's just call and let him know that.
[00:25:34.712 --> 00:25:35.673]  The hate crime bill is important.
[00:25:35.713 --> 00:25:41.897]  We'll have him on for 45 minutes today, but I want to have as much time with Dr. Bob Bowman as possible here in studio.
[00:25:43.638 --> 00:25:49.101]  Okay, from your perspective, and then I want to spend some time on Star Wars, because that's certainly not dead.
[00:25:49.141 --> 00:25:49.981]  That's going on now.
[00:25:50.021 --> 00:25:52.743]  This global decapitation system and a lot of what you told me
[00:25:54.431 --> 00:25:57.413]  Privately, it wasn't classified, you said some of it had leaked out, so you can tell me about it.
[00:25:57.473 --> 00:26:03.377]  It's now kind of coming out in the news, so I wanted to discuss this global decapitation system and what that means for these...
[00:26:04.656 --> 00:26:20.266]  These controllers, but the architecture of this global corporate state from your decades of deep research and also working in some of the most secret black programs, although you were compartmentalized to a certain extent, but in your world travels and knowing a lot of world leaders, what is the architecture of the New World Order?
[00:26:20.346 --> 00:26:21.387]  What is the New World Order?
[00:26:21.727 --> 00:26:22.908]  What is its endgame?
[00:26:23.188 --> 00:26:26.270]  Because from my research, it's eugenics and control and enslavement.
[00:26:27.031 --> 00:26:28.732]  And then looking at Obama,
[00:26:30.026 --> 00:26:35.248]  Well, I think the architecture of the New World Order is, of course, the Council of Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderbergers,
[00:26:52.563 --> 00:26:55.887]  Guys that came out of the old Cecil Rhodes organization.
[00:26:58.551 --> 00:27:00.213]  The corporate governing councils.
[00:27:01.054 --> 00:27:10.446]  But then there's the operating arm, really, is the World Trade Organization, the IMF, and the World Bank.
[00:27:12.544 --> 00:27:19.626]  And with those, and of course since it's under their thumb, the U.S.
[00:27:19.686 --> 00:27:24.467]  government and their enforcers are the U.S.
[00:27:24.547 --> 00:27:25.208]  military.
[00:27:25.808 --> 00:27:34.490]  And we talked before about the military and what happened in Nazi Germany and what's happening here.
[00:27:35.691 --> 00:27:36.711]  One thing that
[00:27:38.627 --> 00:27:42.570]  I've always said, and people mention, what about martial law?
[00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:45.051]  Are they going to do that?
[00:27:45.131 --> 00:27:47.493]  Are they going to round up all of us dissenters?
[00:27:48.533 --> 00:27:50.435]  And I say, who are they going to use?
[00:27:51.275 --> 00:27:53.997]  Because I don't think my buddies in the military will do it.
[00:27:54.437 --> 00:28:03.363]  I think they will encircle us and point their guns outward to protect us from Blackwater, or Z as they call it now.
[00:28:04.343 --> 00:28:06.865]  There's a terrorist organization if ever there was one.
[00:28:08.939 --> 00:28:11.120]  That even sounds like a comic book name.
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:16.121]  I mean, if I was a Pulp Fiction author, Cobra or Z or Chaos.
[00:28:16.181 --> 00:28:18.121]  I mean, Z. Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:19.282 --> 00:28:21.222]  I'm encouraged by the Oath Keepers.
[00:28:21.922 --> 00:28:28.224]  This is an organization that I've joined and many, many in the military and law enforcement have joined.
[00:28:29.564 --> 00:28:36.986]  And it recognizes the fact that our oath of office in the military, in politics, in law enforcement
[00:28:37.862 --> 00:29:02.990]  says that we will protect and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign domestic we don't promise to obey a president or a commander we promise to protect and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestic which by the way includes a renegade president and vice president and so the oath keepers have said
[00:29:04.326 --> 00:29:13.172]  In line with our duty to protect the Constitution, we are going to protect Americans who are following the Constitution.
[00:29:13.793 --> 00:29:29.003]  We are going to refuse any order to disarm American citizens, or arrest American citizens, or incarcerate American citizens, when those citizens are merely exercising their constitutional rights.
[00:29:29.524 --> 00:29:31.105]  And I'm encouraged by that.
[00:29:32.264 --> 00:29:49.409]  Well that's great that you brought that up because we actually sent cameras up to the big Oath Keepers event on Lexington Green and there they all were, just hundreds and hundreds of people from around the country and thousands on the internet at Oath Keepers saying we're not going to go along with this because
[00:29:50.478 --> 00:29:54.124]  It's always been said that tyranny, if it comes, will come to your door in a uniform.
[00:29:54.604 --> 00:29:55.425]  Yeah.
[00:29:55.446 --> 00:30:03.738]  And let's go back though to that power structure because I inadvertently interrupted you seconding what you were saying.
[00:30:04.419 --> 00:30:05.681]  We have at the
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:12.743]  Top, the Council on Foreign Relations, and a few other big think tanks that kind of set the policy.
[00:30:13.163 --> 00:30:17.165]  Well, I mean, you've got the robber... I mean, I want your view, but this is my view.
[00:30:17.305 --> 00:30:22.848]  At the very top, you've got the big robber baron, royal families, the people that control the majority of the world's wealth.
[00:30:23.228 --> 00:30:30.354]  The monopoly capitalists, they'll fund fascists, they'll fund soviets, they'll fund socialists, they'll fund whatever consolidates power.
[00:30:30.554 --> 00:30:42.705]  You've got them at the top, then you've got the big think tanks, the CFR, kind of managing the five or six thousand superclasses, Rothkopf calls it, in his book, bragging about their power, admitting they run the world.
[00:30:43.085 --> 00:30:44.705]  That's kind of their big management team.
[00:30:44.985 --> 00:30:51.527]  And then they've got governmental and quasi-governmental structures and regional roundtables over the different sectors.
[00:30:51.567 --> 00:30:53.587]  And then the enforcers are the military.
[00:30:53.607 --> 00:31:06.550]  But because the military in the West won't carry out these tyrannical actions by and large, because of lessons from history, they're now trying to create special cadres of paramilitary local SWAT teams all being
[00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.390]  I think?
[00:31:38.691 --> 00:31:41.471]  Yeah, I mean, that's certainly a possibility.
[00:31:41.812 --> 00:31:55.276]  What I see is that essential to what they're doing is this whole thing of preventive war, wars of aggression.
[00:31:56.096 --> 00:32:05.580]  The building of their empire by using the militaries of the United States and Great Britain
[00:32:06.931 --> 00:32:07.652]  And Israel.
[00:32:07.873 --> 00:32:12.120]  Don't the bad guys throughout history always, they're the ones that do a preemptive war?
[00:32:12.321 --> 00:32:12.802]  Of course!
[00:32:13.383 --> 00:32:15.467]  In your own words, make that clear to the viewers out there.
[00:32:17.256 --> 00:32:21.919]  Pre-emptive war is another word for war of aggression.
[00:32:22.539 --> 00:32:36.308]  And it's a war crime, according to the Nuremberg Principles which the United States created and established at the end of World War II, and on the basis of which we hung Nazi war criminals who were just following orders.
[00:32:38.266 --> 00:32:42.730]  have established that war of aggression is a war crime.
[00:32:43.151 --> 00:32:48.736]  That is something that Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld should have been indicted for.
[00:32:49.737 --> 00:33:02.209]  And if it is continued much longer under the Obama administration, there are folks in the Obama administration that are putting themselves in danger of becoming war criminals.
[00:33:03.436 --> 00:33:16.281]  What I'm trying to do with the Oath Keepers is to expand the list of orders that they will disobey to include participating in any war of aggression.
[00:33:18.103 --> 00:33:20.284]  Well, I mean, that's what George Washington said.
[00:33:20.325 --> 00:33:22.506]  We don't get in foreign entanglements.
[00:33:22.646 --> 00:33:24.347]  We don't go into foreign wars.
[00:33:25.048 --> 00:33:27.890]  We don't involve ourselves in anything unless we're being attacked.
[00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:40.978]  And then several presidents later, we then see Thomas Jefferson, when some of the Barbary pirates, when some of the Moors were attacking some of our ships, we sent Marines out to deal with it.
[00:33:41.238 --> 00:33:46.042]  But that's something completely different than going into Iraq and leveling the place.
[00:33:46.342 --> 00:33:47.302]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:33:48.123 --> 00:34:01.393]  And these wars of aggression are not only war crimes, they are unconstitutional, and they are treason against the United States of America.
[00:34:01.473 --> 00:34:09.559]  They are killing our young soldiers, our young men and women, using them as hired killers for the corporations.
[00:34:10.079 --> 00:34:11.340]  We've got to stop that.
[00:34:11.961 --> 00:34:14.783]  We have to say that according to the Constitution,
[00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:23.143]  We have got to have a military whose mission is to protect the American people and our borders.
[00:34:23.463 --> 00:34:23.984]  Period!
[00:34:25.069 --> 00:34:25.549]  Period.
[00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:26.270]  End of report.
[00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:33.092]  Not to protect the global financial interests of multinational corporations and banks.
[00:34:33.653 --> 00:34:38.875]  Bechtel, Halliburton, Exxon, Folgers, Chiquita Banana, you name it.
[00:34:39.395 --> 00:34:46.158]  What about the imperial hubris of DynCorp and Halliburton in the news running
[00:34:47.338 --> 00:34:55.124]  White slavery trafficking and then Rumsfeld is asked about it by Cynthia McKinney when she was in Congress and he says, I'm not going to discuss it.
[00:34:55.144 --> 00:34:57.186]  They were in the penalty box, now they're out of the penalty box.
[00:34:57.486 --> 00:34:58.427]  They got a fine.
[00:34:59.187 --> 00:35:04.972]  No one goes to jail, but if somebody kidnaps a child down the street from a playground, there's amber alerts and freakouts.
[00:35:05.012 --> 00:35:16.861]  I mean, the level of looting, the Goldman Sachs openly, you know, running the White House, the last two White Houses openly engaging in cash payments to themselves
[00:35:17.321 --> 00:35:21.826]  With their former executives running the Treasury and running the Federal Reserve.
[00:35:22.527 --> 00:35:32.940]  Yeah, and on that note, I've got to say, any corporation, any entity which is too big to fail, is too big to exist.
[00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:36.360]  We used to have anti-trust laws.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.401]  We used to have anti-monopoly laws.
[00:35:39.621 --> 00:35:41.162]  It's time we did again.
[00:35:41.362 --> 00:35:43.803]  Isn't that just a mind game to say, too big to fail?
[00:35:44.143 --> 00:35:47.924]  Or, well, yeah, the president ordered torture and it is illegal, but he's the president.
[00:35:48.144 --> 00:35:50.045]  And then you just give in to the dictatorship.
[00:35:50.085 --> 00:35:51.265]  You give in to the tyranny.
[00:35:51.526 --> 00:36:00.289]  It's that seduction, and then finally you have a capitulation to evil, and it's just, oh, that's just the way it is, and then the sky's the limit.
[00:36:01.277 --> 00:36:06.642]  Yeah, and it all rests on the myths that we are told.
[00:36:07.703 --> 00:36:10.226]  And the antidote is the truth!
[00:36:11.187 --> 00:36:17.853]  And that's why what we are doing, Alex, you and I, and so many of our buddies, is so important.
[00:36:18.253 --> 00:36:20.436]  We've got to explode those myths.
[00:36:21.485 --> 00:36:33.496]  Because it's upon those myths, like 9-11, that all the evil actions get carried out and excused off and justified.
[00:36:35.037 --> 00:36:43.744]  There are a lot of these truths that we need to expose, not just 9-11.
[00:36:43.805 --> 00:36:44.145]  For example,
[00:36:46.369 --> 00:36:57.314]  I'd like to expose all the myths that we've been told about the murders of our soldiers in the field, especially the women.
[00:36:57.494 --> 00:36:58.334]  Most of them are women.
[00:36:59.635 --> 00:37:06.978]  I think families have a right to know what really happened to soldiers like Pat Tillman and Levina Johnson.
[00:37:08.103 --> 00:37:18.910]  Now, most of the viewers know who Pat Tillman is, you know, football star turned war hero turned conscientious objector, which the army said was killed in action.
[00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:21.672]  Then they said, well, it was really friendly fire.
[00:37:22.353 --> 00:37:28.797]  But there is a lot of evidence that that so-called friendly fire came from less than 10 feet.
[00:37:29.378 --> 00:37:32.560]  And he was really fragged because he was turning against the war.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.662]  And that would be embarrassing to the establishment.
[00:37:35.802 --> 00:37:44.908]  Well, the Army's own internal reports that have finally been brought out, and I've actually talked to the family, was that they shot him, he hid behind a rock, and he said, hey, I'm Pat Tillman, what's your problem?
[00:37:45.188 --> 00:37:46.769]  And they walked right up and did him.
[00:37:47.669 --> 00:37:51.172]  And my God, those soldiers followed that order.
[00:37:52.308 --> 00:37:54.228]  I guess by probably the CIA in the field.
[00:37:54.568 --> 00:37:56.469]  I didn't know who it was.
[00:37:56.489 --> 00:37:59.469]  Pat was sending letters home saying I'm going to come home and speak out against this fraud.
[00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:00.870]  We're guarding the opium.
[00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:10.692]  I even heard BBC admit about a month ago on XM that oh yes the US troops are guarding the opium and letting the farmers sell it so the Taliban doesn't get a foothold.
[00:38:10.932 --> 00:38:15.813]  The Taliban runs those fields and now there's heroin all over the streets.
[00:38:15.833 --> 00:38:19.413]  It was on local news last night that everybody's on heroin now in Austin.
[00:38:19.794 --> 00:38:21.694]  I mean the government openly ships it in.
[00:38:22.114 --> 00:38:23.915]  They'll openly kill Pat Tillman!
[00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:25.516]  But now, see, that's patriotic.
[00:38:25.556 --> 00:38:26.496]  Oh, we have to kill Pat.
[00:38:26.797 --> 00:38:27.617]  It's for America.
[00:38:27.957 --> 00:38:29.918]  We've got to ship heroin for the kids, Bob.
[00:38:29.938 --> 00:38:30.378]  Yeah.
[00:38:30.719 --> 00:38:35.641]  Well, you know, but I bet you most of the people out there never even heard of Laveena Johnson.
[00:38:35.761 --> 00:38:36.722]  Tell folks about her.
[00:38:37.002 --> 00:38:47.127]  Well, Laveena Johnson was a young American girl, African-American, lovely, Christian, virgin.
[00:38:47.667 --> 00:38:49.989]  She volunteered to fight in Iraq.
[00:38:51.055 --> 00:38:53.177]  Her body was found in a Halliburton tent.
[00:38:54.178 --> 00:38:57.922]  Her body was shipped home, her parents, in a closed casket.
[00:38:58.263 --> 00:39:01.566]  Her parents told not to open the casket.
[00:39:02.207 --> 00:39:06.171]  Well, her father was a physician, still is, and I've talked to him personally.
[00:39:07.136 --> 00:39:09.759]  He opened the casket and he examined his daughter.
[00:39:10.279 --> 00:39:11.640]  Her brains had been blown out.
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:13.842]  There were bruises all over her body.
[00:39:14.283 --> 00:39:16.245]  Her hands were badly burned.
[00:39:16.585 --> 00:39:18.767]  Too badly burned to hold a gun, for example.
[00:39:19.468 --> 00:39:25.934]  And her genitals had acid poured on them in an apparent attempt to destroy DNA evidence.
[00:39:26.754 --> 00:39:29.277]  The army ruled it a suicide.
[00:39:30.973 --> 00:39:37.754]  A government that honors the truth must seek out the truth and then tell the truth.
[00:39:37.794 --> 00:39:39.595]  And by God, we have to demand that.
[00:39:39.975 --> 00:39:43.896]  Well, that's what I was going to point out, is that once you give in to evil, it's all over.
[00:39:43.936 --> 00:39:44.596]  Sky's the limit.
[00:39:44.876 --> 00:39:53.538]  I mean, and these psychological warfare chiefs, they cold-bloodedly knew when they had Rumsfeld come out and go, we're taking off the gloves, we're doing it for America.
[00:39:53.558 --> 00:39:54.938]  This was a seduction of evil.
[00:39:55.518 --> 00:40:01.522]  And then as soon as you say torture's okay, then the Washington Post had an article going, yeah, we're doing stuff to their kids in front of them.
[00:40:01.863 --> 00:40:16.173]  And then when Khalid Sheikh Mohammed confessed to everything but killing Kennedy and sinking the Lusitania, and bombing buildings that weren't built until four years after he was incarcerated, and they were waterboarding him multiple times a week for years, it turned out that was all staged.
[00:40:16.734 --> 00:40:17.914]  Some of the torturers
[00:40:18.955 --> 00:40:27.898]  Some of the detainees said, well we were ordered to, here's our national security letter, they arrested the torturers and used the Patriot Act to gag them.
[00:40:28.178 --> 00:40:28.998]  That was in the news.
[00:40:29.358 --> 00:40:32.880]  So the issue here is, even the torturers will be sold out.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:43.223]  Why do all of these people, for money printed up out of nothing by the private banks, sell their entire souls and then it becomes unpatriotic?
[00:40:44.144 --> 00:41:01.948]  When they're killing all these Marine Corps and Army investigators in corruption, and they're killing all these officers, and all this corruption is set in, and then now the C-130s are collapsing with buckets to use the bathroom in, but the officers have new jets with, like, pleasure palaces in them with secretaries.
[00:41:02.368 --> 00:41:07.130]  I mean, this is like Rome burning and Nero's guzzling wine up on the parapet.
[00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:10.370]  I mean, this is disintegration level.
[00:41:11.371 --> 00:41:11.691]  It is.
[00:41:14.144 --> 00:41:18.346]  The last 30 years I've been quoting scripture.
[00:41:20.467 --> 00:41:30.153]  Psalm 33, a king is not saved by his mighty army, a warrior is not saved by his great strength, the war horse is a vain hope for victory and in its might it cannot save.
[00:41:31.914 --> 00:41:35.215]  Psalm 37 gives the prescription for national security.
[00:41:35.335 --> 00:41:41.859]  It says, trust in the Lord and do good that you may dwell in the land and have security.
[00:41:42.915 --> 00:41:48.937]  By accepting the evil, we are destroying this country and its security.
[00:41:50.218 --> 00:41:51.038]  And it's incredible.
[00:41:51.078 --> 00:41:54.719]  It's like the New World Order really are like alchemists or magicians.
[00:41:54.739 --> 00:41:56.680]  They've got a spell on the people of darkness.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.401]  They're obsessed with petty issues.
[00:41:58.701 --> 00:42:00.041]  They can't tell good from bad.
[00:42:00.081 --> 00:42:04.783]  They accept the evil, not knowing it destroys the whole system.
[00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:19.454]  I mean, let's face it, these people that we're talking about who are guilty of this evil are motivated by greed and power.
[00:42:20.934 --> 00:42:22.375]  Money and power.
[00:42:24.614 --> 00:42:32.716]  It doesn't matter whether you say, oh, they want a fascist New World Order or they want a communist New World Order.
[00:42:32.996 --> 00:42:33.776]  It doesn't matter.
[00:42:34.296 --> 00:42:37.137]  What they want is the money and power.
[00:42:38.277 --> 00:42:40.498]  And we have to take it away from them.
[00:42:40.978 --> 00:42:45.719]  We have to separate big money from political power in this country.
[00:42:46.799 --> 00:42:49.962]  And that's not easy to do, but we have to do it.
[00:42:50.682 --> 00:42:55.185]  We have to have a government which is not bought and paid for by those big money interests.
[00:42:55.966 --> 00:42:57.107]  Bob, gotta break, gotta break.
[00:42:57.127 --> 00:42:58.148]  This is amazing stuff.
[00:42:58.168 --> 00:42:59.689]  We'll be right back with more of Bob Bowman.
[00:43:00.256 --> 00:43:03.637]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[00:43:03.797 --> 00:43:13.279]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[00:43:13.419 --> 00:43:20.261]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.
[00:43:20.481 --> 00:43:33.972]  If you are ready to live your life free of sickness, pain, and fear, live your life with increased vitality, energy, and youthfulness, and experience your body healing itself, then you're ready for Heart and Body Extract from Healthy Hearts Club.
[00:43:34.012 --> 00:43:39.596]  Here is what one satisfied customer had to say about Heart and Body Extract regarding his angina pain.
[00:43:39.797 --> 00:43:42.779]  I haven't had an angina pain since I've been on it.
[00:43:42.799 --> 00:43:45.261]  The Heart and Body Extract is just so great.
[00:43:45.361 --> 00:43:50.105]  I thank God that I was led to this product that's doing so much for me, and that can do so much for other people.
[00:43:50.885 --> 00:44:06.232]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:44:06.933 --> 00:44:12.275]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:44:12.815 --> 00:44:18.978]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:19.298 --> 00:44:21.139]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:21.259 --> 00:44:23.661]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:44:23.741 --> 00:44:34.687]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:44:36.928 --> 00:44:38.209]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:39.990]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:46.714]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:22.851]  Bob Bowman, it's just wonderful having you here.
[00:46:24.052 --> 00:46:25.593]  It's great to have you here in town with us.
[00:46:25.833 --> 00:46:33.857]  I'm making another Obama film, and I thought about having you in that, and just thought, oh, he's busy and I'm busy, and I kind of rushed that out.
[00:46:34.677 --> 00:46:36.018]  That film had five interviews.
[00:46:36.058 --> 00:46:36.938]  This one's got ten.
[00:46:36.978 --> 00:46:37.839]  This will be the eleventh.
[00:46:38.419 --> 00:46:39.219]  I'm doing one more.
[00:46:39.239 --> 00:46:41.741]  This film is just jam-packed.
[00:46:42.441 --> 00:46:47.425]  And it's just perfect to have you, and you've now agreed that you want to be in the film, so you're going to be in the next Obama film.
[00:46:47.485 --> 00:46:51.848]  I haven't released the name yet, but that will be out in October, folks.
[00:46:51.868 --> 00:46:52.888]  We're taking our time on this.
[00:46:52.969 --> 00:46:54.710]  I was going to release it quickly, but I'm taking my time.
[00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:58.913]  But we're going to talk about Obama now, coming up in his list of betrayals.
[00:46:59.273 --> 00:47:01.535]  And again, we're not attacking Obama in a left-right paradigm.
[00:47:01.555 --> 00:47:08.840]  We're attacking to show he's a deceiver, a betrayer, and Bob was proudly saying if he does buck him, they'll destroy him like they've done others.
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.822]  But before we go there, tell folks about your speaking tour.
[00:47:13.567 --> 00:47:19.370]  Well, I've had a couple of events so far and there are dozens to come.
[00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:24.413]  We're covering the eastern half of the country this summer in four and a half months.
[00:47:24.973 --> 00:47:27.855]  We're not trying to do the whole country this year like we have the last few.
[00:47:28.235 --> 00:47:31.397]  Speaking in Austin tonight at Brave New Books at 7 o'clock.
[00:47:31.837 --> 00:47:34.578]  On the 11th we're speaking in the Dallas area.
[00:47:34.939 --> 00:47:40.422]  We're going from there to Oklahoma City and then Tulsa and up to Kansas City and on.
[00:47:40.742 --> 00:47:42.503]  And people can check the website.
[00:47:43.143 --> 00:48:03.722]  thepatriots.us and find out where we're going to be when and uh... people can call me on my cell phone for goodness sakes i have it with me uh... they can call the organizers uh... the organizers are uh... listed uh...
[00:48:05.593 --> 00:48:09.056]  In a document that's been sent around all over the country.
[00:48:09.076 --> 00:48:14.400]  So thepagerants.us, and you're going to be speaking at Brave New Books down at the end of Guadalupe, off the drag.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:17.262]  Great bookstore, great place down there this evening.
[00:48:17.302 --> 00:48:18.903]  So folks, be sure to get there early.
[00:48:19.804 --> 00:48:24.567]  It's got room for about 150 folks, and it's pretty much always standing room only if you get there late.
[00:48:25.388 --> 00:48:28.771]  But regardless, it's a great event, great folks down there at Brave New Books.
[00:48:29.551 --> 00:48:31.193]  Now, Bob, this is a short segment.
[00:48:31.233 --> 00:48:45.668]  We're almost out of time here today, and I've got some sponsors I need to thank here for just a moment, but then we're going to come back to you in just a second, and we're going to keep it for 15 more minutes, getting into Obama, getting into the globalist agenda, what's going to happen if they hit Iran.
[00:48:46.269 --> 00:48:47.711]  Before we do that,
[00:48:48.769 --> 00:48:54.651]  I want you to know about some of the folks that have made today's show possible, and that's New Silver Solution.
[00:48:55.411 --> 00:49:02.593]  New Silver Solution is what I use in my house if one of my kids has an infection or if I've got a cold.
[00:49:03.153 --> 00:49:05.934]  It's antiviral and antibacterial.
[00:49:05.954 --> 00:49:15.197]  Now, nothing is a silver bullet, pun intended, but silver has been proven for a long time, and this has been clinically proven to just have a massive effect, and we've had a lot of medical doctors here on air
[00:49:15.717 --> 00:49:21.082]  When nothing's working with these bacteria and viruses to say that nano-silver is the way to go.
[00:49:21.422 --> 00:49:33.653]  So SupernaturalSilver.com, SupernaturalSilver.com, and there's banners up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, so be sure and check out SupernaturalSilver.com today.
[00:49:33.753 --> 00:49:36.415]  Every cupboard, every medicine cabinet needs to have it.
[00:49:37.276 --> 00:49:40.737]  Also, another one of our fine sponsors I want to tell you about is HomeGain.
[00:49:41.517 --> 00:49:42.978]  And this is a great service.
[00:49:43.018 --> 00:49:43.858]  It's a free service.
[00:49:43.938 --> 00:49:46.859]  It's H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[00:49:46.899 --> 00:49:48.519]  HomeGain dot com.
[00:49:48.919 --> 00:49:54.961]  You can simply visit their site and or click through on Max Little Orange Gorilla on InfoWars dot com.
[00:49:56.144 --> 00:49:58.626]  And they have a whole bunch of free services there.
[00:49:58.646 --> 00:50:00.528]  Again, the whole site's free at homegame.com.
[00:50:00.548 --> 00:50:06.433]  They have Street View, where you can look at the house street level and take a virtual walk through the neighborhood you're interested in.
[00:50:07.013 --> 00:50:08.094]  You've got to see it for yourself.
[00:50:08.134 --> 00:50:09.336]  And again, it's absolutely free.
[00:50:10.136 --> 00:50:17.483]  I personally like the Home Sale Maximizer to help you determine which home improvements can most increase your home's value before you put it on the market.
[00:50:17.563 --> 00:50:18.664]  And it's absolutely free.
[00:50:19.124 --> 00:50:26.911]  And they have another system where you put in your home address and it tells you what the realtors are really seeing internally of what they think the value is on your home.
[00:50:27.131 --> 00:50:30.614]  Whether they're underestimating or overestimating with what they're publicly telling you.
[00:50:30.854 --> 00:50:32.576]  So that's HomeGain.com.
[00:50:32.636 --> 00:50:34.778]  Home G-A-I-N.com.
[00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:35.879]  HomeGain.com.
[00:50:36.219 --> 00:50:38.981]  And my websites of course are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:50:40.122 --> 00:50:45.107]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:50:45.827 --> 00:50:49.371]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:50:50.052 --> 00:50:51.633]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:51.753 --> 00:50:56.438]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:50:56.498 --> 00:50:59.241]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:50:59.461 --> 00:51:02.324]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:02.504 --> 00:51:08.350]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:11.512]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:11.813 --> 00:51:18.718]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:51:18.798 --> 00:51:21.921]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:51:22.081 --> 00:51:23.962]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:51:27.225 --> 00:51:33.289]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, prescribed and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:37.252]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:37.272 --> 00:51:38.593]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:51:38.613 --> 00:51:39.194]  Take action today.
[00:51:39.234 --> 00:51:41.055]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:52.739 --> 00:51:54.660]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:58.021]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:04.463 --> 00:52:05.103]  Big Brother.
[00:52:05.764 --> 00:52:06.844]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:08.665]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:09.285 --> 00:52:10.145]  You want answers?
[00:52:10.865 --> 00:52:12.786]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:12.806 --> 00:52:16.107]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:16.607 --> 00:52:20.669]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:24.254 --> 00:52:28.916]  By the way, you know who else is going to be in the new Obama film?
[00:52:29.817 --> 00:52:30.997]  You know what, I'm not going to announce it.
[00:52:31.217 --> 00:52:32.338]  This thing's got everybody.
[00:52:32.798 --> 00:52:33.318]  It's crazy.
[00:52:34.079 --> 00:52:37.580]  And they all really make key points and it all comes together as a synergy.
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:44.103]  Most of these guys don't even know each other, but they're all on the same page for liberty and freedom.
[00:52:44.463 --> 00:52:46.264]  Okay, Bob, I've got a bunch of rapid-fire questions.
[00:52:46.564 --> 00:52:47.405]  Barack Obama.
[00:52:48.737 --> 00:52:50.558]  I mean, he said he wasn't going to hire lobbyists.
[00:52:50.598 --> 00:52:53.820]  In your own words, as we're also taping for the live film, you know, go over it.
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.741]  He's lied about not hiring lobbyists.
[00:52:55.781 --> 00:52:57.262]  He's lied about signing statements.
[00:52:57.302 --> 00:53:01.585]  He's lied about not raising taxes unless you're above $250,000 a year.
[00:53:02.486 --> 00:53:14.173]  It's a huge stunt where they've moved some of the troops out of a few cities and redrawn the lines of Baghdad and five other cities where the bases are on the cities and the troops are there, but they're just now saying that isn't part of the city.
[00:53:14.613 --> 00:53:17.175]  They're playing all sorts of semantical and statistical games.
[00:53:17.495 --> 00:53:20.801]  They're increasing troops to 100,000 in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[00:53:21.142 --> 00:53:23.506]  They're escalating the great game in Divide and Conquer there.
[00:53:26.067 --> 00:53:26.967]  I didn't like Slick Willie.
[00:53:27.007 --> 00:53:28.107]  I didn't like George W. Bush.
[00:53:28.127 --> 00:53:29.348]  I didn't like George Bush's daddy.
[00:53:29.688 --> 00:53:30.748]  I didn't like any of these guys.
[00:53:30.788 --> 00:53:32.808]  But Obama, he said, I mean it.
[00:53:32.988 --> 00:53:33.609]  I pledge.
[00:53:33.649 --> 00:53:34.469]  This is real.
[00:53:34.809 --> 00:53:35.669]  You can trust me.
[00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:38.369]  And, I mean, is he the New World Order closer?
[00:53:38.449 --> 00:53:42.150]  I mean, we know he's filled his administration with old brass of the neocons.
[00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:51.772]  And is it only people like Fox Phelan or Fallon quitting that are stopping him from attacking Iran with Biden saying, green light, baby, go in?
[00:53:53.633 --> 00:53:55.593]  I'm not sure, but I...
[00:53:56.782 --> 00:54:02.576]  I hope that Obama will return to what he knows is right.
[00:54:06.357 --> 00:54:10.119]  A bumbling ignoramus puppet like we've had.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:23.448]  He is intelligence, he is articulate, he is charismatic, and this makes him far more dangerous than George W. Bush, if he allows himself to be used.
[00:54:23.948 --> 00:54:35.536]  But because he is intelligent, because he used to be a community organizer, because of what he's said in the past, I believe he really wants to do the right thing by the American people
[00:54:36.707 --> 00:54:39.949]  But he doesn't know how to do it.
[00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:44.213]  And we're going to tell him how to do it.
[00:54:44.253 --> 00:54:46.194]  But isn't that the best kind of Judas goat?
[00:54:46.754 --> 00:54:50.938]  Is somebody who believes that they're selling the magic elixir or whatever?
[00:54:50.958 --> 00:54:57.302]  I mean, I agree he's charismatic, he's slick, but he is reading off a teleprompter written by the military industrial complex.
[00:54:57.322 --> 00:54:58.423]  Can you speak to the teleprompter?
[00:54:58.883 --> 00:55:01.866]  I think that he is so intelligent
[00:55:02.847 --> 00:55:04.968]  That he's going to see through it at some point.
[00:55:05.309 --> 00:55:09.571]  And like Jimmy Carter, he's going to turn against his masters.
[00:55:10.812 --> 00:55:16.256]  And Carter had the presidency essentially taken out of his hands by Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[00:55:18.457 --> 00:55:21.459]  Obama has the same mentor, Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:26.423]  And we know that there's going to be a struggle if Obama says,
[00:55:27.412 --> 00:55:28.673]  I'm not doing this anymore.
[00:55:29.053 --> 00:55:33.296]  I promised real change, and what I've given the American people is Trump change.
[00:55:34.016 --> 00:55:41.742]  We're gonna have real change, and I'm gonna start serving the people, and you guys in the big corporations, you know, sorry about that.
[00:55:57.793 --> 00:56:07.383]  And, uh, I know what I'm seeing on his face, and I know you're hoping that he'll reverse course, but I mean, do you admit he has completely done a 180 from what he said he would do?
[00:56:08.625 --> 00:56:08.885]  Sure.
[00:56:09.746 --> 00:56:16.774]  Uh, he has done some good things, he has made some positive changes, but like I say, Chump change.
[00:56:17.135 --> 00:56:17.755]  Chump change.
[00:56:18.813 --> 00:56:43.988]  uh... for him to to really come around is going to be dangerous to him uh... barracks one weakness it seems is that he like he wants to be liked by everybody including the global elites and the fact is you can't serve two masters and he is at some point going to have to decide whether he's going to carry through on his
[00:56:45.359 --> 00:56:56.288]  Pre-election pledges to serve us, the American people, or if he's going to continue to serve those global elites that he has surrounded himself with.
[00:56:56.629 --> 00:56:57.890]  Alright, stay there, we got a break.
[00:56:58.050 --> 00:56:59.151]  I'm back with Bob Bowman.

[00:57:59.686 --> 00:58:03.668]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:03.929 --> 00:58:05.730]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:14.175]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:58:14.435 --> 00:58:19.660]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:58:19.981 --> 00:58:21.582]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:58:21.843 --> 00:58:28.189]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:58:28.369 --> 00:58:32.894]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere.
[00:58:33.134 --> 00:58:33.534]  That's right.
[00:58:59.721 --> 00:59:05.283]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[00:59:05.584 --> 00:59:06.744]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:59:06.884 --> 00:59:10.846]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around called InnerFood.
[00:59:11.166 --> 00:59:19.310]  My wife just loves the stuff and now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:23.011]  Interfood is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[00:59:23.331 --> 00:59:24.812]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[00:59:25.072 --> 00:59:27.853]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[00:59:28.073 --> 00:59:29.514]  And their formula really works.
[00:59:29.794 --> 00:59:32.335]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[00:59:32.615 --> 00:59:33.856]  Try the NutriCafe.
[00:59:34.096 --> 00:59:38.498]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[00:59:38.858 --> 00:59:41.079]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[00:59:41.279 --> 00:59:43.540]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:45.481]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[00:59:45.841 --> 00:59:48.222]  Go to www.interfood.com
[00:59:48.362 --> 00:59:49.342]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.178 --> 01:00:07.239]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.959 --> 01:00:09.060]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.701 --> 01:00:10.541]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.302 --> 01:00:12.142]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.863 --> 01:00:16.485]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.046 --> 01:00:21.149]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.309 --> 01:00:25.412]  Final segment with Dr. Bob Bowman here in studio with us.
[01:00:25.432 --> 01:00:32.797]  Coming up in the next segment for the rest of the hour, we've got Reverend Ted Pike joining us to break down the hate crimes legislation.
[01:00:34.286 --> 01:00:35.147]  It's past the house.
[01:00:35.927 --> 01:00:38.329]  And it's so draconian, it makes my head spin.
[01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:40.631]  I mean, it just outright gets rid of the First Amendment.
[01:00:41.031 --> 01:00:42.353]  Okay, Bob, you were continuing.
[01:00:42.853 --> 01:00:46.696]  You know, looking at Obama, everything that Clinton set up was a foundation for Bush.
[01:00:46.756 --> 01:00:50.739]  Everything Bush set up was a foundation now for Obama.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.260]  And Obama
[01:00:53.061 --> 01:01:00.368]  Whether it's draconian gun control, or expanding wars, or bringing in more corporate lobbyists, or banking looting.
[01:01:01.069 --> 01:01:05.393]  It doesn't matter what it is, or a tax on free speech, with all this legislation.
[01:01:05.413 --> 01:01:12.880]  I mean, it's even got my head spinning that they're moving this fast, and they're getting so much of it passed, or on the verge of passing.
[01:01:14.764 --> 01:01:21.989]  Is this the system starting to panic or in your view, I mean speak to that, you hear they're rushing things right now and why are they rushing things?
[01:01:22.049 --> 01:01:33.577]  Is it because things are going so well or is this a failing forward because they see the audit of the Fed building, they see people becoming knowledgeable about the power structure and its architecture, they see the military waking up.
[01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:35.579]  What's happening?
[01:01:36.286 --> 01:01:37.668]  Oh, I think they're very worried.
[01:01:37.968 --> 01:01:40.651]  They're worried about all of us dissenters.
[01:01:40.671 --> 01:01:46.437]  They're worried about Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich working together, old friends of mine.
[01:01:46.837 --> 01:01:49.781]  They're worried about the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:01:49.941 --> 01:01:53.705]  They're worried about Obama and their control over him.
[01:01:54.265 --> 01:02:00.109]  I think they're greatly worried and they're trying to get done what they need to get done.
[01:02:00.609 --> 01:02:03.491]  I sent Obama an inaugural address.
[01:02:03.611 --> 01:02:04.632]  He didn't use it.
[01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:08.595]  But those are the things that he ought to do.
[01:02:09.075 --> 01:02:11.317]  He needs to reverse course.
[01:02:12.017 --> 01:02:30.341]  He needs to get rid of all 1,100 signing statements of George W. Bush and promise that he's not going to do that because the Constitution doesn't give the President the power to make legislation or unmake it.
[01:02:30.721 --> 01:02:33.802]  It gives that to the Congress, the people's representatives.
[01:02:34.622 --> 01:02:35.423]  He needs to
[01:02:38.177 --> 01:02:44.259]  Do away with Presidential Directives 20 and 51, which give him dictatorial powers.
[01:02:44.919 --> 01:02:53.982]  He needs to tell Congress that they've got to repeal the misnamed Patriot Act and the Military Commissions Act.
[01:02:54.602 --> 01:03:05.946]  He has to get rid of all of the executive orders and legislation which is the foundation of martial law and the incarceration of the US citizens.
[01:03:06.305 --> 01:03:07.266]  You know, that's a key point.
[01:03:07.306 --> 01:03:10.911]  I've forgotten even making this film we're making, so please make it now, Dr. Bowman.
[01:03:11.131 --> 01:03:13.094]  I mean, with more details.
[01:03:13.114 --> 01:03:21.785]  He's keeping everything Bush is doing on the signing statements in the police state and the Patriot Act and
[01:03:22.828 --> 01:03:29.572]  Now saying, yeah, even if these detainees are found not guilty in kangaroo courts, we're still going to hold them.
[01:03:30.172 --> 01:03:34.734]  I mean, that's throw you in the dungeon, throw away the key, the bedrock of tyranny, is it not?
[01:03:35.034 --> 01:03:36.675]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:03:37.095 --> 01:03:39.276]  And he's got to do away with that.
[01:03:39.577 --> 01:03:43.759]  He's got to release all those detained without charge.
[01:03:44.319 --> 01:03:45.420]  He has to really
[01:03:47.725 --> 01:03:53.182]  Close Guantanamo Bay and tell the American people, don't worry, we'll find somewhere else for Bush and Cheney.
[01:03:55.427 --> 01:03:57.808]  I mean, he's got to make those bold steps.
[01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:01.009]  He's got to give us real change.
[01:04:01.189 --> 01:04:02.330]  Change we can believe in.
[01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:03.250]  That's what he promised.
[01:04:03.591 --> 01:04:04.831]  That's what he has to do.
[01:04:05.391 --> 01:04:09.713]  The American people are not going to be satisfied with Trump change.
[01:04:10.253 --> 01:04:11.134]  And we know better.
[01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:12.494]  Okay, well they're starting.
[01:04:13.715 --> 01:04:16.016]  President Obama's poll numbers are starting to really slide.
[01:04:17.268 --> 01:04:20.212]  And a lot of his supporters are saying, where is the change?
[01:04:20.232 --> 01:04:24.857]  This looks like more of the same, same globalist corporate agenda, same New World Order.
[01:04:25.498 --> 01:04:34.168]  What is going to happen when they try to give the Federal Reserve this fall total power, not just over banking, but over all financial operations, from a hot dog stand to a
[01:04:35.049 --> 01:04:38.571]  It has been said by some very good people, those who make
[01:05:06.578 --> 01:05:07.478]  Peaceful revolution.
[01:05:07.498 --> 01:05:09.359]  Peaceful revolution impossible.
[01:05:09.819 --> 01:05:12.160]  Make violent revolution inevitable.
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:12.640]  Start over.
[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:13.080]  That was great.
[01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:14.381]  I interrupted it for helping you out.
[01:05:14.421 --> 01:05:14.701]  Go ahead.
[01:05:15.381 --> 01:05:15.561]  Tell us.
[01:05:15.601 --> 01:05:24.125]  Those who make peaceful change impossible make violent revolution inevitable.
[01:05:24.205 --> 01:05:29.947]  I heard that many times when I was sharing the stage with William Sloan Coffin.
[01:05:30.287 --> 01:05:32.868]  And of course, he got it from the Kennedys.
[01:05:34.068 --> 01:05:35.229]  And it's true.
[01:05:36.843 --> 01:05:45.975]  The only way we're going to save this country is through a non-violent revolution.
[01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:51.001]  We need exactly what Obama promised.
[01:05:51.141 --> 01:05:53.024]  Well, I described a non-violent
[01:05:53.942 --> 01:05:54.562]  Revolution.
[01:05:54.622 --> 01:05:56.543]  Here's Ocean Spray Cranberry Drink.
[01:05:57.763 --> 01:06:04.464]  And I couldn't buy this for the last decade because it had high fructose corn syrup in it, which had been proven in a lot of studies to be linked to diabetes and a lot of problems.
[01:06:04.945 --> 01:06:07.485]  Also, for some reason, it has high levels of mercury.
[01:06:07.825 --> 01:06:08.765]  In fact, people won't believe it.
[01:06:08.785 --> 01:06:10.406]  Put the Washington Post up.
[01:06:10.666 --> 01:06:12.526]  Half of corn syrup products have mercury in it.
[01:06:13.307 --> 01:06:14.347]  And so I couldn't drink it.
[01:06:14.427 --> 01:06:18.728]  But now, suddenly, it has pure sugarcane in it as its ingredient.
[01:06:19.748 --> 01:06:23.389]  That was because the people stopped buying anything with high fructose corn syrup.
[01:06:23.769 --> 01:06:29.911]  Overnight, it's vanishing like a vapor at morning, like phantoms at dawn.
[01:06:30.391 --> 01:06:39.154]  There is a microcosm of us voting with our dollars and our ideas, and by getting the word out, person to person, and then voting with our dollars.
[01:06:39.714 --> 01:06:40.755]  Yeah.
[01:06:41.475 --> 01:06:44.036]  But right now, I am hoping
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:47.983]  That Obama will give us some real leadership.
[01:06:48.343 --> 01:06:53.849]  He's the only president we've got and I'm not giving up on him yet.
[01:06:54.709 --> 01:06:58.113]  But, you know, we can't wait forever.
[01:06:58.513 --> 01:07:00.855]  He may only have four years.
[01:07:02.037 --> 01:07:06.461]  And he's got to take action and take it now.
[01:07:09.531 --> 01:07:10.071]  Absolutely.
[01:07:10.131 --> 01:07:11.852]  I mean, I'm making a big deal out of this today.
[01:07:11.872 --> 01:07:20.375]  This is a huge victory, Bob, that this product, and many others, has high fructose corn syrup in it.
[01:07:20.515 --> 01:07:30.598]  And now, because the people are saying no word of mouth, even with the big high fructose corn syrup, Archer Daniels, meddling propaganda ads that they've been running the last year on every TV channel I've seen,
[01:07:31.318 --> 01:07:31.919]  They failed.
[01:07:32.299 --> 01:07:34.501]  Again, we have to get our spirit back.
[01:07:34.601 --> 01:07:36.462]  We have to say we don't have a broken spirit.
[01:07:36.742 --> 01:07:37.903]  We're not capitulating.
[01:07:37.923 --> 01:07:39.265]  We're not giving into your tyranny.
[01:07:39.465 --> 01:07:41.606]  We're not giving into a global corporate dictatorship.
[01:07:41.987 --> 01:07:52.075]  And with that said, your breakdown briefly on what's happening with the banking takeover, this engineered financial collapse, are they going to be successful?
[01:07:53.427 --> 01:07:58.871]  Well, they've already been successful in stealing hundreds of billions of dollars from the American people.
[01:07:59.432 --> 01:08:06.757]  It's, you know, pump all the money to the top, promise the people it's going to trickle down, and of course it never does.
[01:08:07.498 --> 01:08:08.899]  And this is a part of it.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:15.564]  And, like I said, if they're too big to fail, they're too big to exist.
[01:08:16.985 --> 01:08:17.545]  Absolutely.
[01:08:17.585 --> 01:08:22.149]  That said, just a few more quick questions while we've still got you here in studios before Reverend Ted Pike comes up.
[01:08:25.297 --> 01:08:40.887]  When you're out there across the land, when you're out there speaking to the people, I've already talked about HR 1207 to Audit the Fed having 250 plus sponsors, even if the Senate runs a procedural scam and won't let it come to a vote, now the people are saying, why are you hiding this?
[01:08:41.954 --> 01:08:43.155]  What are you covering up?
[01:08:43.255 --> 01:08:46.437]  People are now discovering the Federal Reserve is the real dictatorship.
[01:08:46.717 --> 01:08:47.918]  It sits above the whole country.
[01:08:48.258 --> 01:08:51.660]  And I'm just seeing everywhere across the political spectrum an awakening.
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:56.703]  Can you speak to auditing the Fed and speak to what you're seeing across the country with an awakening?
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:08.984]  We not only need to audit the Fed, and I certainly support that, but eventually we need to disband the Fed.
[01:09:09.065 --> 01:09:10.065]  We need to get rid of it.
[01:09:11.265 --> 01:09:16.648]  Many people say, well, giving the Fed more power is okay because we're going to nationalize it.
[01:09:16.968 --> 01:09:18.789]  We're going to make it really federal.
[01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:21.970]  I mean, right now it's no more federal than Federal Express.
[01:09:24.884 --> 01:09:31.043]  That doesn't do any good if the Federal Reserve becomes really a part of the government.
[01:09:32.477 --> 01:09:38.780]  That's going to be okay only if the government is still not ruled by these global money elites.
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:40.541]  And right now it is.
[01:09:41.321 --> 01:09:48.345]  So we have to keep spreading the message that the Federal Reserve is private.
[01:09:49.465 --> 01:09:55.008]  It has private stockholders, like the Queen of England and a lot of other folks.
[01:09:55.942 --> 01:10:00.244]  They don't put a penny of their money at risk when they loan to the U.S.
[01:10:00.324 --> 01:10:00.864]  government.
[01:10:01.324 --> 01:10:03.165]  They're not loaning their own money.
[01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:06.526]  They're just putting an entry in a ledger.
[01:10:07.807 --> 01:10:18.911]  And they're getting hundreds of billions of our tax dollars in interest payments every year when not a penny of their money is at risk.
[01:10:19.251 --> 01:10:20.952]  What kind of a return is that?
[01:10:21.512 --> 01:10:23.173]  It's infinite percent.
[01:10:24.917 --> 01:10:28.500]  This isn't even fractional reserve banking.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.422]  This is just complete flim-flam fraud.
[01:10:31.822 --> 01:10:34.604]  And through this magic checkbook, they've gained the whole world.
[01:10:34.884 --> 01:10:37.305]  So of course they want to implode the economy and get us into debt.
[01:10:37.626 --> 01:10:38.866]  That's how they get control of us.
[01:10:38.886 --> 01:10:40.688]  That's how they get the real assets.
[01:10:40.728 --> 01:10:44.230]  Well, you're traveling across the country on a speaking tour.
[01:10:44.250 --> 01:10:48.493]  Folks can find out more, of course, at the website.
[01:10:49.093 --> 01:10:51.514]  ThePatriots.us.
[01:10:51.794 --> 01:10:53.435]  ThePatriots.us.
[01:10:53.835 --> 01:10:55.996]  Dr. Bob Bowman, it's great having you here.
[01:10:56.016 --> 01:11:05.280]  We didn't have time to get into, when you started speaking out against the Star Wars program as a decapitation weapon, how you experienced the rigged game.
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:07.821]  You said GE came and offered you a big buyout?
[01:11:09.141 --> 01:11:16.868]  Yeah, I got attempted bribery, attempted blackmail, death threats, IRS harassment.
[01:11:16.908 --> 01:11:19.050]  I got three audits in two years.
[01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:21.652]  The FBI and the CIA called me in.
[01:11:23.414 --> 01:11:30.400]  Yeah, they didn't like me speaking out and telling the American people it was an offensive weapon disguised as defense.
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:32.402]  What did the CIA say when they called you in?
[01:11:33.993 --> 01:11:41.855]  Well, they didn't like the fact that I was traveling overseas speaking against actions of the U.S.
[01:11:41.935 --> 01:11:42.495]  government.
[01:11:44.016 --> 01:11:52.758]  And, you know, as if not agreeing with government actions was somehow unpatriotic.
[01:11:53.478 --> 01:11:59.140]  And, you know, this whole idea is why we have to insist on free speech.
[01:12:00.541 --> 01:12:01.021]  Attention!
[01:12:01.221 --> 01:12:16.276]  An important product from hempusa.org, micro plant powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[01:12:16.556 --> 01:12:25.000]  Micro plant powder is 89% silica and packed with a negative charge that attracts positive toxins from the blood, organs, spine and brain.
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:30.902]  This product has the ability to rebuild cartilage and bone which allows synovial fluid to return to the joints.
[01:12:31.143 --> 01:12:36.865]  Silica is a precursor to calcium, meaning the body turns silica into calcium and is great for the heart.
[01:12:37.005 --> 01:12:42.488]  There is no better time than now to have micro plant powder on your shelf or in your storage shelter.
[01:12:42.668 --> 01:12:45.469]  And with an unlimited shelf life you can store it anywhere.
[01:12:45.849 --> 01:12:50.933]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org.

[01:12:59.379 --> 01:13:04.642]  Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources and let me ask just one question.
[01:13:05.383 --> 01:13:08.445]  What would you list as the things that the federal government does really well?
[01:13:09.105 --> 01:13:11.407]  The armed forces and printing bogus money doesn't count.
[01:13:11.986 --> 01:13:17.954]  Now take that blank page of yours and list the ways that you have to protect your assets and escape the paper markets.
[01:13:18.554 --> 01:13:20.377]  The only real option is precious metals.
[01:13:20.917 --> 01:13:26.625]  For your retirement, your kid's education, or just plain survival when the whole Obama mess comes crashing down.
[01:13:27.574 --> 01:13:30.196]  You are the only one you can count on for a stimulus package.
[01:13:30.696 --> 01:13:34.639]  And I'd like to discuss a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your family.
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:39.603]  Please give me a call at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[01:13:40.723 --> 01:13:44.566]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[01:13:45.247 --> 01:13:48.529]  And together we can develop a Make Sense program before the clock runs out.
[01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:50.911]  Once more, John Swenson at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[01:13:51.071 --> 01:13:52.472]  And take charge of your future and thank you.
[01:14:00.638 --> 01:14:05.960]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:12.002]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:14:12.543 --> 01:14:18.705]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:14:19.045 --> 01:14:20.866]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:14:21.006 --> 01:14:23.407]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:14:23.487 --> 01:14:34.412]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:14:36.653 --> 01:14:37.954]  It's not about left or right.
[01:14:38.334 --> 01:14:39.735]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:14:40.195 --> 01:14:46.418]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:14:48.031 --> 01:15:01.114]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:15:01.154 --> 01:15:06.495]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:15:06.735 --> 01:15:11.356]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:15:11.756 --> 01:15:16.777]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that it could even happen again.
[01:15:17.324 --> 01:15:22.025]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:15:22.545 --> 01:15:24.466]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:15:24.846 --> 01:15:29.467]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:15:29.667 --> 01:15:30.567]  And here's the best part.
[01:15:30.787 --> 01:15:33.548]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:15:33.848 --> 01:15:37.149]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:15:37.469 --> 01:15:40.309]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:15:40.650 --> 01:15:42.550]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:43.790]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:15:48.812 --> 01:15:51.153]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:15:51.673 --> 01:15:56.195]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:15:56.515 --> 01:15:58.956]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:16:01.396 --> 01:16:06.558]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:07.218 --> 01:16:09.479]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:16:25.282 --> 01:16:27.043]  Okay, he's a very busy man.
[01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:29.484]  He does hundreds of radio talk interviews.
[01:16:29.824 --> 01:16:31.425]  True Tellers is the website.
[01:16:31.445 --> 01:16:33.025]  We'll give you the full address here in a moment.
[01:16:33.465 --> 01:16:34.446]  He's Reverend Ted Pike.
[01:16:35.326 --> 01:16:41.829]  And he fights the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, the Globalist, who openly in Europe have banned free speech.
[01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:43.270]  They're banning it in Canada.
[01:16:43.710 --> 01:16:45.431]  And I have the bills here in front of me.
[01:16:45.451 --> 01:16:46.211]  This is past the house.
[01:16:47.872 --> 01:16:49.853]  And it has language I never saw before.
[01:16:50.765 --> 01:17:09.263]  Which says, whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce, any communication, that's the internet, with the intent to coerce, intimidate, harass, or cause substantial emotional distress, and I've seen the federal judges argue, and he has the videos up on his site, maybe we'll pull some of those up in a few minutes, where they're saying, no, if you hurt somebody's feelings, we're going to arrest you.
[01:17:10.143 --> 01:17:22.530]  So substantial emotional distress to a person using electronic means to support severe repeated or hostile behavior, hostile saying I'm sick of your tyranny, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years or both.
[01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:26.212]  And then it goes on to say anyone trying to influence politicians
[01:17:27.112 --> 01:17:30.954]  Uh, anyone, uh, trying to... I mean, this is the end of free speech.
[01:17:30.994 --> 01:17:31.815]  This is the end of it.
[01:17:32.175 --> 01:17:34.396]  And they always say, oh, let's ban Nazis' free speech.
[01:17:34.736 --> 01:17:37.518]  Whether you love a Nazi's speech or hate a Nazi's speech.
[01:17:37.918 --> 01:17:40.619]  Whether you love a Black Panther's speech or hate their speech.
[01:17:40.859 --> 01:17:45.282]  Whether you like Mecha saying they're the God race and for the race everything, those outside the race nothing.
[01:17:45.802 --> 01:17:46.502]  The point is...
[01:17:47.623 --> 01:17:56.568]  They sell this idea and then they want to restrict everybody's free speech and are openly saying in congressional hearings, ban free speech, ban...
[01:17:59.392 --> 01:18:02.694]  Architects and engineers, and they put them up next to Al-Qaeda training videos.
[01:18:02.734 --> 01:18:05.396]  So, nobody has fought this like Reverend Ted Pike.
[01:18:05.436 --> 01:18:08.458]  And I saw the language in this and didn't think it could pass the House.
[01:18:08.558 --> 01:18:09.398]  It has passed, folks.
[01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:10.199]  It has happened.
[01:18:10.639 --> 01:18:13.441]  Just like the carbon bill, and just like everything else is passing.
[01:18:13.781 --> 01:18:15.402]  This is the time the new order is taking over.
[01:18:15.462 --> 01:18:19.645]  So, quick segment now, do this for the rest of the hour, maybe a little bit longer if you can do it.
[01:18:19.665 --> 01:18:20.565]  We have another guest coming up.
[01:18:21.266 --> 01:18:23.207]  Reverend Ted Pike, tell us what's happening.
[01:18:23.247 --> 01:18:26.629]  I've never seen things this ominous, America in this much peril.
[01:18:27.148 --> 01:18:38.112]  Well, actually, Alex, what you are quoting there from is the Anti-Defamation League's anti-bullying bill, which is a separate bill, which is now in the House Judiciary.
[01:18:38.432 --> 01:18:40.753]  But I saw the same language in the hate bill, correct?
[01:18:40.873 --> 01:18:43.214]  And that federalizes local police.
[01:18:43.434 --> 01:18:49.436]  Yeah, the hate bill, which is S-909, is a different piece of legislation, and that has passed the House.
[01:18:49.756 --> 01:18:52.957]  The anti-bullying bill is still in the House Judiciary.
[01:18:53.277 --> 01:19:17.462]  Now, what the Federal Hate Crimes Bill, S-909, the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, says, back in its original 1968 hate law, which was passed at the height of the Civil Rights Movement just after Martin Luther King was killed, it says in Title 18, Section 2A, that anyone, a talk show host, a pastor, even a person on the street corner,
[01:19:17.882 --> 01:19:25.510]  Who uses language that might induce or incite some unstable person to commit a hate crime.
[01:19:25.730 --> 01:19:28.674]  He could be 2,000 miles away and hear you on the radio.
[01:19:29.134 --> 01:19:39.685]  Then that original speaker can be tried as a principal in federal court right along with the active offender with a possible 10-year prison sentence.
[01:19:39.705 --> 01:19:40.266]  So you see,
[01:19:41.118 --> 01:20:09.163]  This big federal hate bill, which could go for a vote next week in the Senate, is basically a series of amendments on that original 1968 law, which was basically a hate crime, a speech law, but it really couldn't be enforced effectively because of something called states' rights and law enforcement, which prohibited the federal government from coming down any time it wanted and intervening and taking over in states' rights.
[01:20:09.663 --> 01:20:18.008]  All of those barriers, the six major barriers, will be washed away if the federal hate bill is passed in the Senate.
[01:20:18.488 --> 01:20:30.535]  And basically what it'll be doing is establishing a police state system, a perfect unity, a seamless unity between federal policing powers and local policing powers.
[01:20:32.336 --> 01:20:33.057]  Please continue.
[01:20:33.891 --> 01:20:34.191]  Yes.
[01:20:34.311 --> 01:20:49.038]  Now, the big problem this week is the Democrats have decided they are going to attach the hate bill, S-909, onto the defense authorization bill, which is up for a vote perhaps as early as next Wednesday.
[01:20:49.498 --> 01:21:01.543]  Now, we have a tremendous opportunity here now to destroy the hate bill because two weeks ago, in the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Attorney General of the United States, Eric Holder,
[01:21:02.103 --> 01:21:03.864]  Really, really messed up.
[01:21:03.904 --> 01:21:12.571]  He came in there with great prestige and for 45 minutes he was supposed to undergird and support and strengthen the hate bill.
[01:21:12.711 --> 01:21:14.832]  Actually, he did exactly the opposite.
[01:21:15.112 --> 01:21:17.154]  He shut off his mouth and he said,
[01:21:17.794 --> 01:21:23.960]  That this hate bill, contrary to what it says on the first bill, the first page of S.
[01:21:24.361 --> 01:21:30.127]  909, this bill will not protect all Americans according to race and religion and gender.
[01:21:30.187 --> 01:21:41.358]  No, he said, this is a very specific bill meant to protect only historically persecuted groups like blacks, like homosexuals, like Jews.
[01:21:42.298 --> 01:21:49.682]  So actually what this does is create a super group of super citizens, titles of nobility, here in the United States.
[01:21:50.602 --> 01:21:53.543]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.464 --> 01:21:57.145]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:59.946 --> 01:22:04.928]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:22:05.148 --> 01:22:08.930]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:22:09.170 --> 01:22:14.772]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:22:15.072 --> 01:22:15.512]  It's true.
[01:22:15.712 --> 01:22:19.934]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:22:20.134 --> 01:22:26.497]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:22:26.677 --> 01:22:29.838]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:22:29.838 --> 01:22:29.998]  I think?
[01:22:59.494 --> 01:23:00.595]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:02.675]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:23:02.875 --> 01:23:03.556]  Well, you should.
[01:23:03.856 --> 01:23:08.098]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:23:08.338 --> 01:23:08.838]  That's right.
[01:23:09.158 --> 01:23:17.602]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[01:23:17.802 --> 01:23:19.062]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[01:23:19.162 --> 01:23:20.323]  Plus, if you act fast.
[01:23:20.523 --> 01:23:26.145]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:23:26.506 --> 01:23:33.028]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:23:33.409 --> 01:23:38.591]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:23:38.911 --> 01:23:40.072]  This is real.
[01:23:40.373 --> 01:23:41.114]  Don't miss out.
[01:23:41.434 --> 01:23:49.803]  Secure a Front Sight Defensive Handgun Course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.
[01:23:50.003 --> 01:23:52.166]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[01:23:52.366 --> 01:23:55.890]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:58.974]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[01:23:59.773 --> 01:24:01.334]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:24:01.454 --> 01:24:06.115]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:24:06.195 --> 01:24:08.936]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:24:09.157 --> 01:24:11.998]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:24:12.178 --> 01:24:18.040]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:21.202]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:24:21.522 --> 01:24:28.407]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:24:28.487 --> 01:24:31.629]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:24:31.789 --> 01:24:33.450]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.
[01:24:36.932 --> 01:24:42.995]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, free stride, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:24:43.195 --> 01:24:46.777]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:24:46.797 --> 01:24:48.158]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:24:48.238 --> 01:24:48.898]  Take action today.
[01:24:48.938 --> 01:24:50.719]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:24:50.739 --> 01:24:51.799]  We all need no education.
[01:25:12.182 --> 01:25:18.326]  Folks, since I got Reverend Ted Pike on late, he's going to be with us into the next half hour of the final hour.
[01:25:18.386 --> 01:25:28.913]  Then the guest from the San Antonio newspaper who went and took a photo of the public NSA snooping base, the cyber security internet snooping base, where Big Brother reads our mail.
[01:25:29.834 --> 01:25:31.935]  They ran out and grabbed him, basically kidnapped him.
[01:25:32.135 --> 01:25:33.396]  That's coming up in the last 30 minutes.
[01:25:33.816 --> 01:25:36.118]  We're going to go back to Reverend Ted Pike to break this down.
[01:25:38.683 --> 01:25:44.268]  You know, he's always there ringing the alarm bell when they try to destroy the First Amendment, but this time they're coming the closest I've ever seen.
[01:25:44.528 --> 01:25:45.569]  We'll see if he agrees with me.
[01:25:45.989 --> 01:25:50.553]  He was explaining to me during the break that it's similar language in the cyberbullying and the hate bill.
[01:25:50.573 --> 01:25:51.614]  In fact, I have both of them here.
[01:25:52.435 --> 01:26:02.763]  But that the hate bill is even worse than the passages I was reading, so we're going to go over that and play the video clip of them admitting that Holder is saying that, no, this doesn't protect everybody.
[01:26:03.504 --> 01:26:05.766]  This only creates a select group that's protected.
[01:26:05.986 --> 01:26:13.010]  But before we go back to Ted Pike, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that are making this hour of the radio show possible.
[01:26:13.531 --> 01:26:15.872]  And one of those is MySolarBackup.com.
[01:26:15.912 --> 01:26:17.513]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[01:26:17.894 --> 01:26:19.455]  Hurricanes, snow, and ice, and storms.
[01:26:19.855 --> 01:26:22.757]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a great way to do just that.
[01:26:23.237 --> 01:26:28.060]  A solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[01:26:28.461 --> 01:26:31.683]  You get an emergency power backup kit, which consists of the PowerSource 1800,
[01:26:34.205 --> 01:26:38.027]  800 watt generator and a high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[01:26:38.387 --> 01:26:43.791]  Remember too that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[01:26:44.272 --> 01:26:46.433]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[01:26:46.793 --> 01:26:48.755]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks.
[01:26:49.798 --> 01:26:50.998]  So make your move today.
[01:26:51.399 --> 01:26:52.879]  Go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:26:52.899 --> 01:26:54.540]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:55.020]  One word.
[01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:57.721]  MySolarBackup.com or give them the toll-free number.
[01:26:58.681 --> 01:27:00.862]  Folks, you can give them a call at the toll-free number 877-327-0365.
[01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:00.922]  877-327-0365.
[01:27:00.962 --> 01:27:02.882]  And then in closing, gotta get one plug in today.
[01:27:12.674 --> 01:27:24.824]  For my films, ladies and gentlemen, my DVDs, my films have been seen by conservatively, well, the Obama deception, well over 15 million people in three months, free on YouTube and Google.
[01:27:24.964 --> 01:27:26.525]  You can go count up all the views on the channels.
[01:27:27.066 --> 01:27:30.568]  And I quit counting a month ago, so it's more than that.
[01:27:30.588 --> 01:27:32.170]  15 million views, free on the web.
[01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:37.094]  This baby, over 20 million views in the last two years, online.
[01:27:38.047 --> 01:27:39.348]  Over 20 million we know of.
[01:27:40.029 --> 01:27:41.850]  Now, I've only sold a few thousand DVDs.
[01:27:42.030 --> 01:27:42.631]  I don't care.
[01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:44.052]  I love reaching people.
[01:27:44.152 --> 01:27:45.053]  I love saving lives.
[01:27:45.173 --> 01:27:50.357]  I love people understanding the globalists are eugenicists who openly want to set up world government.
[01:27:50.377 --> 01:27:52.038]  People say, okay, we're going to live under a world government.
[01:27:52.058 --> 01:27:52.438]  Big deal.
[01:27:52.999 --> 01:27:54.200]  It's to kill you folks.
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:55.421]  It is to persecute you.
[01:27:55.741 --> 01:27:57.142]  It is to rip you limb from limb.
[01:27:57.442 --> 01:27:59.724]  This film is life-saving.
[01:28:00.124 --> 01:28:01.105]  Get the DVD.
[01:28:01.425 --> 01:28:01.766]  Have it.
[01:28:02.506 --> 01:28:05.751]  Send people the free clips online or the full film.
[01:28:05.891 --> 01:28:08.114]  Watch it in high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:28:08.575 --> 01:28:09.155]  15 cents a day.
[01:28:09.816 --> 01:28:11.479]  Then it's streamed to you in super high quality.
[01:28:11.499 --> 01:28:12.400]  You can burn it to disk.
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:13.541]  Burn it to DivX.
[01:28:13.582 --> 01:28:14.883]  Give it to people in higher quality.
[01:28:15.104 --> 01:28:17.887]  Because a lot of folks won't watch the cruddy YouTube or Google quality.
[01:28:19.093 --> 01:28:21.054]  The point is, this is high quality DVD.
[01:28:21.455 --> 01:28:25.818]  Respect yourself enough to have it in high quality if you're going to spend two hours and forty minutes watching it.
[01:28:25.978 --> 01:28:29.240]  There's an online bibliography proving every claim and document in this film.
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:32.342]  Whatistheendgame.com or endgamethemovie.com will get you there.
[01:28:32.722 --> 01:28:35.084]  The Obama Deception, the biggest film I've ever released.
[01:28:36.081 --> 01:28:49.666]  It shatters the left-right paradigm, exposes how both parties are controlled, the hate speech laws, the tyranny, the FEMA camps, the NORTHCOM, Obama being a liar, but showing people, Republicans who watch it, that Bush was a liar as well.
[01:28:50.066 --> 01:28:52.347]  This film is shattering the left-right paradigm.
[01:28:52.887 --> 01:28:54.048]  Biggest film we've ever released.
[01:28:54.368 --> 01:29:02.656]  Get it on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv or call toll free to get these films and others 888-253-3139 888-253-3139 We have also released
[01:29:10.433 --> 01:29:12.674]  A bunch of new Patriot t-shirts.
[01:29:12.715 --> 01:29:14.175]  We're putting new ones out every week.
[01:29:14.556 --> 01:29:17.958]  So check out all the new t-shirts we've added at InfoWars.com.
[01:29:18.418 --> 01:29:25.903]  We have the Socialism is Stealing shirt that shows a guy putting a gun to somebody's head who's got a bag of money stealing and saying socialism.
[01:29:26.143 --> 01:29:28.104]  There's a war on for your mind InfoWars.com.
[01:29:28.364 --> 01:29:34.288]  We've got a new t-shirt that has a cop with a billy club on the back saying don't steal the government hates competition.
[01:29:34.648 --> 01:29:36.610]  InfoWars.com on the front.
[01:29:37.450 --> 01:29:41.034]  We've got Minutemen, Coal Pepper Flag, Don't Tread on Me shirts.
[01:29:41.354 --> 01:29:42.915]  You want to meet like-minded people?
[01:29:43.256 --> 01:29:46.839]  You wear one of these shirts out in the city square or at the coffee shop.
[01:29:47.099 --> 01:29:48.861]  You're going to meet fellow Info Warriors.
[01:29:49.722 --> 01:29:51.143]  You're going to meet fellow Patriots.
[01:29:51.584 --> 01:29:53.245]  This is about us being open.
[01:29:53.485 --> 01:29:54.586]  We're mainstream.
[01:29:54.827 --> 01:29:56.348]  We're not going to shut up our speech.
[01:29:56.588 --> 01:30:01.253]  We're not going to let the DHS report saying Christians and gun owners and libertarians are terrorists.
[01:30:01.673 --> 01:30:03.814]  We're not going to let their demonization work.
[01:30:03.854 --> 01:30:05.455]  We're not going to let their chilling effect work.
[01:30:05.775 --> 01:30:11.618]  Get the shirts, get the DVDs, get the materials, InfoWars.com or watch them all in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:30:11.698 --> 01:30:11.918]  Okay.
[01:30:12.018 --> 01:30:19.161]  You're not going to see me for the next 10-15 minutes because I'm going to try to sit back and shut up and have Reverend Pike run over all the facts.
[01:30:19.221 --> 01:30:20.762]  Reverend, go back into that.
[01:30:21.762 --> 01:30:24.424]  Go back into the fact because I've read the bills and you're absolutely right.
[01:30:24.444 --> 01:30:25.364]  You're the expert on this.
[01:30:25.464 --> 01:30:25.964]  There it is.
[01:30:26.465 --> 01:30:28.726]  Federalizing all the local police further.
[01:30:29.847 --> 01:30:35.870]  Teaching them with federal training by the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center to be political officers.
[01:30:37.111 --> 01:30:49.998]  Jason Burmiss' mom was driving into New York, went through the tollway, doesn't have a transponder so they give you a little ticket card, and the ticket card said suspicious person, a yellow card, and the person said I'm giving you this card because of your 9-11 truth sticker.
[01:30:50.658 --> 01:30:52.299]  And so she was then seen as a terrorist.
[01:30:52.319 --> 01:31:01.385]  They're already beginning the no-fly, no-buy, or no-buy, no-fly bills to ban you flying if you're on a no-fly list, to ban you having a job.
[01:31:01.405 --> 01:31:04.808]  1,200,000 on it and growing each month by 24,000.
[01:31:06.128 --> 01:31:12.973]  It's this whole culture of Soviet-style secret police, commissariat, turning our local police into political officers.
[01:31:13.313 --> 01:31:19.177]  So I want you to go over that and then explain to us the hate bill versus the other bill, then later we'll play the holder clip.
[01:31:21.018 --> 01:31:23.500]  TruthTellers.org, you've got the floor, break it down.
[01:31:24.081 --> 01:31:31.627]  Well, as I was saying, Attorney General Holder has given a tremendous tool to those who want to defeat this hate bill.
[01:31:32.227 --> 01:31:49.661]  And what he said, again, is number one, that they're contrary to what the bill says on the front page, that all people, all American citizens, according to race, religion, or gender, will be protected by the federal government from violent hate crimes in the state if this bill is passed.
[01:31:50.041 --> 01:31:51.282]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:31:51.322 --> 01:32:05.067]  This bill is for those historically victimized groups, basically of white, Christian, heterosexual civilization, primarily homosexuals, blacks, even women, Jews, on and on.
[01:32:05.087 --> 01:32:12.810]  And number two, what came out in the cross-examination in the judiciary just two weeks ago was that
[01:32:13.777 --> 01:32:16.699]  Holder could not find a single example.
[01:32:16.759 --> 01:32:24.304]  He could not present any statistics that the state are not punishing violent hate crimes on the local level.
[01:32:24.604 --> 01:32:30.949]  He was again and again asked, and we have this in this 10-minute video at truthtellers.org.
[01:32:31.269 --> 01:32:35.312]  Again, Senator Sessions, Senator Colbert on this.
[01:32:35.512 --> 01:32:37.593]  Just give us one example, and he couldn't.
[01:32:37.953 --> 01:32:38.594]  And you see what
[01:32:38.994 --> 01:32:54.865]  What this video does, that we have at truthtellers.org, is it knocks the foundation out of two of the very strongest arguments which the Anti-Defamation League has convinced, not only the members of Congress though, but of state legislators, ADL,
[01:32:55.615 --> 01:33:00.357]  Trump is proud at his website, ADL.org, that it persuaded 45 U.S.
[01:33:01.018 --> 01:33:04.560]  states to adopt some version of its model and a hate law.
[01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:12.263]  And right at the beginning of the argument of the ADL throughout the 1990s, the legislators on the local level was this promise.
[01:33:12.283 --> 01:33:12.764]  Oh no!
[01:33:13.904 --> 01:33:16.966]  This bill is not favoritistic towards some groups.
[01:33:17.326 --> 01:33:20.948]  This bill will protect everyone according to race, religion, and gender.
[01:33:21.288 --> 01:33:23.710]  See, it's written right there on the front page.
[01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:26.631]  And all these legislators said, well, that's great.
[01:33:26.711 --> 01:33:27.952]  Everybody's going to be protected.
[01:33:28.352 --> 01:33:34.896]  Now, astonishingly, the Attorney General of the United States is saying, no, this is an egalitarian,
[01:33:35.456 --> 01:33:42.519]  Very discriminatory law against the 99% plus of the American people.
[01:33:42.799 --> 01:33:48.741]  This is only to protect those victims of historic Christian white heterosexual persecution.
[01:33:50.330 --> 01:34:09.355]  What we have to realize is that this is a massive scam, a massive takeover, a massive erosion of the First Amendment to the Constitution, giving us free speech, of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, which tells the federal government to butt out of states' rights and law enforcement, and of course,
[01:34:10.075 --> 01:34:17.182]  The 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which says the government can't exalt one group above the other.
[01:34:17.202 --> 01:34:26.210]  Now, what I am calling all Americans to do in the next several days is to call in to your senators.
[01:34:26.670 --> 01:34:31.415]  And also, at truthtellers.org, we have all 100 members of the U.S.
[01:34:31.435 --> 01:34:31.835]  Senate.
[01:34:32.115 --> 01:34:33.617]  Go there on the action page.
[01:34:34.415 --> 01:34:41.977]  And spend some time this week because the hate bill is scheduled to go through to possible passage by mid-next week.
[01:34:42.297 --> 01:34:43.717]  Spend some time before work.
[01:34:43.818 --> 01:34:51.600]  Spend some time during your lunch break calling all senators if you possibly can with this very simple message.
[01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:56.501]  This is an astonishing simple message, but here's what I'd like you to say.
[01:34:57.281 --> 01:35:00.722]  Ask the staffers there, have you watched?
[01:35:01.681 --> 01:35:10.523]  The shocking video that shows Attorney General Holder saying there is no equal protection under the hate bill.
[01:35:11.103 --> 01:35:14.084]  It's on the homepage at truthtellers.org.
[01:35:14.464 --> 01:35:25.966]  Now what we want to do, we want to absolutely saturate the Senate of the United States, especially the Democrats, as well as the Republicans, with the staffers, the senators,
[01:35:26.346 --> 01:35:43.450]  The aides all watching, the Attorney General of the United States now telling the whole world that contrary to what the ADL and Holder have been telling the Democrats, there is no equal justice under this hate bill.
[01:35:43.730 --> 01:35:55.193]  There is no reason for the federal government to come down and meddle in local law enforcement because the states are doing a perfectly good job of prosecuting hate crimes.
[01:35:56.098 --> 01:35:59.721]  People need to, number one, come to truthtellers.org.
[01:35:59.741 --> 01:36:04.664]  The Holder video, the Holder expose, is right there on the homepage.
[01:36:05.024 --> 01:36:10.588]  Click off and go on to a journey in the hate-billed fantasy land, according to Holder.
[01:36:10.949 --> 01:36:19.675]  And then, number two, call these numbers to your members of the Senate, and hopefully all 100 members of the Senate.
[01:36:19.935 --> 01:36:21.156]  Here's the toll-free number.
[01:36:21.176 --> 01:36:21.216]  877-851-8000.
[01:36:26.471 --> 01:36:31.836]  6 4 3 7 again the toll free number to the Senate 8 7 7 8 5 1 6 4 3 7 and the backup toll number is 2 0 2 2 2 5 3 1 2 1 again that backup number is 2 0 2 2 2 5
[01:36:50.657 --> 01:36:50.997]  3-1-2-1.
[01:36:51.017 --> 01:36:55.980]  And here again is the simple message you deliver to the staffers.
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:58.641]  And you don't even have to say you're against the hate bill.
[01:36:58.681 --> 01:37:09.305]  Just say, have you watched the shocking video that shows Attorney General Holder saying there is no equal protection under the hate bill?
[01:37:09.886 --> 01:37:13.367]  It's on the homepage at truthtellers.org.
[01:37:13.447 --> 01:37:15.248]  Now what we're finding is that doesn't
[01:37:15.908 --> 01:37:19.651]  Dozens of staffers are now watching this video.
[01:37:19.971 --> 01:37:24.755]  Dozens are reporting that they will watch it and they're going to be recommending it to their senators.
[01:37:25.115 --> 01:37:27.257]  We want a totally avalanche.
[01:37:27.557 --> 01:37:44.370]  Congress, that is the Senate, in the next several days before mark-up hearing, perhaps on Monday or Tuesday, and a vote perhaps next Wednesday, we want to knock out the pillars underneath the two of the very strongest arguments which the liberals have made for the hate bill.
[01:37:45.407 --> 01:37:57.556]  Well, I mean, inherently in Europe, it's only select groups that are protected, and then once they say, okay, you're arrested if you say that 5,999,000 Jews died, not 6 million.
[01:37:58.016 --> 01:38:00.898]  And then, okay, you're arrested if you call somebody the N-word.
[01:38:01.299 --> 01:38:09.605]  And then, I have mainstream BBC articles, BBC headlines, hundreds arrested in hate sweep, and they have secret agents that
[01:38:10.658 --> 01:38:35.631]  sit in the bars and restaurants to hear hundreds of different racial terms and then now we're hearing oh we want to add the term uh... midget to be banned by the FCC from talk radio when a midget isn't even a derogatory uh... term you know it's called midgets and dwarfs two different you know a a a midget is somebody who's proportionately
[01:38:36.471 --> 01:38:36.852]  I don't think so.
[01:38:55.313 --> 01:39:00.334]  He gave a speech saying we deserve the same rights for rural communities as homosexuals and Muslims.
[01:39:00.754 --> 01:39:04.736]  He was arrested and they said the word homosexual is hateful.
[01:39:05.276 --> 01:39:07.356]  So even scientific terms aren't allowed.
[01:39:07.636 --> 01:39:09.317]  It's at their discretion.
[01:39:09.357 --> 01:39:12.898]  So once they've done this, now they're saying climate change denial.
[01:39:13.398 --> 01:39:14.398]  You need to be arrested.
[01:39:14.418 --> 01:39:17.039]  And this is the point I want to raise here.
[01:39:18.059 --> 01:39:19.640]  I can see how I'm being set up.
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:22.981]  And I want you to comment on this and then have the floor and go over this, sir.
[01:39:23.001 --> 01:39:24.461]  But I want to inject this here.
[01:39:25.808 --> 01:39:27.049]  I'm already experiencing it.
[01:39:27.169 --> 01:39:48.163]  When Mr. Poplosky killed the three cops a few months ago in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, within two hours of him killing the cops and then giving up, there was an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette attacking me in the headline, by name, saying Poplosky was a fan and I influenced him to do this.
[01:39:49.133 --> 01:40:03.346]  Now, it then came out later that they'd gotten his comments off InfoWars, and he'd been on hundreds of sites, Fox News, you name it, and that he was actually attacking me for not being anti-Semitic.
[01:40:03.906 --> 01:40:14.996]  But the point is, I talked to the reporter, and he's a little guy who works with the local Southern Poverty Law Center, they all have their little pet reporters, within two hours of
[01:40:16.512 --> 01:40:31.099]  These cops being killed, they had gone in the computers, their operatives in the police department had fed that to the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center, but Southern Poverty Law Center specifically had then fed it to demonize me in the news.
[01:40:31.639 --> 01:40:33.039]  Same thing with Von Brun.
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:39.842]  And then now I have reporters calling me up from national publications, Psychology Today, Wall Street Journal,
[01:40:41.843 --> 01:40:47.027]  A bunch of other newspapers, where I'm not even calling them back now, going, are you making people kill people?
[01:40:47.287 --> 01:40:48.788]  Should your speech be restricted?
[01:40:48.868 --> 01:41:08.103]  So, I'm now seeing the setup, where I've got some of the biggest websites out there, I've got the biggest alternative websites, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, where it's all about what people say on my message board, or if they tell police they never heard my show, I'm being set up for arrest, exactly what the bill says,
[01:41:08.783 --> 01:41:09.023]  Absolutely.
[01:41:09.043 --> 01:41:13.807]  Now, this present bill, the Senate version, will be able to go back seven years into your past, Alex.
[01:41:13.908 --> 01:41:15.909]  Any statement you have made
[01:41:25.217 --> 01:41:40.907]  Over the past seven years, which might be construed to have influenced, aided, or abetted the commission of a violent hate crime, you can be tried as a principal in federal court, right along with that person who claims
[01:41:41.488 --> 01:41:48.713]  That over the past seven years he's heard Alex Jones say hateful or hurtful things against these protected minorities.
[01:41:49.334 --> 01:41:56.699]  And you remember David Irving was indicted and convicted in Austria for statements he made something like ten years previously.
[01:41:56.719 --> 01:41:58.440]  These hate laws
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:02.322]  I am now the number one target
[01:42:22.845 --> 01:42:26.908]  When these things happen, just briefly, Ted, what does that mean about my show?
[01:42:27.428 --> 01:42:30.390]  I don't even really get into racial stuff and religious things.
[01:42:30.710 --> 01:42:32.451]  Why do you think they're after me so bad?
[01:42:34.352 --> 01:42:37.794]  Well, they're after you because you are politically incorrect.
[01:42:38.675 --> 01:42:47.100]  And communist-style government means that anyone who's against Soviet reality in Russia was indictable and sent off to the gulag.
[01:42:48.761 --> 01:42:50.702]  This really is not just tyranny.
[01:42:50.742 --> 01:42:52.163]  This is the most hardcore
[01:42:53.826 --> 01:42:55.767]  All this hate speech stuff is from the Soviet Union.
[01:42:55.827 --> 01:42:58.787]  Explain the history of this when we get back and how we beat this bill.
[01:42:58.847 --> 01:42:59.608]  Reverend Ted Pike.
[01:43:00.328 --> 01:43:02.808]  The phone rings and the questions are asked.
[01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:04.049]  I've been so sick.
[01:43:04.369 --> 01:43:05.749]  Will the life change tea help me?
[01:43:06.049 --> 01:43:07.470]  Our answer is always the same.
[01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:08.170]  Yes.
[01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:13.591]  Toxins and chemicals from food, water and air are attacking you this very moment.
[01:43:14.031 --> 01:43:19.493]  Fight back with our all natural detoxifying tea that works immediately.
[01:43:19.913 --> 01:43:24.135]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[01:43:24.416 --> 01:43:25.396]  We use results.
[01:43:25.816 --> 01:43:30.279]  LifeChangeT's formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[01:43:30.579 --> 01:43:34.881]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[01:43:35.201 --> 01:43:38.663]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[01:43:39.063 --> 01:43:42.545]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.
[01:43:42.966 --> 01:43:43.566]  Our number is 928-308-0408.
[01:43:47.890 --> 01:43:50.191]  Again, that's 928-308-0408.
[01:43:50.912 --> 01:43:54.534]  Or you can order online at GetTheTea.com.
[01:43:54.674 --> 01:43:56.995]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[01:43:57.195 --> 01:43:59.817]  And remember, we have the cheapest shipping in the industry.
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:06.105]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:06.585 --> 01:44:13.592]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:44:14.192 --> 01:44:20.358]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:20.758 --> 01:44:22.599]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:22.739 --> 01:44:25.160]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:44:25.241 --> 01:44:36.166]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:44:36.807 --> 01:44:38.107]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:38.488 --> 01:44:39.868]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:44:40.349 --> 01:44:46.572]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:56.671]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:57.091 --> 01:44:58.272]  The people strike back!
[01:45:00.026 --> 01:45:01.167]  Does the economy have you down?
[01:45:01.347 --> 01:45:02.888]  Scared you might lose your job?
[01:45:03.028 --> 01:45:04.969]  Worry how you will provide for your family?
[01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:07.031]  Do you worry where your money will come from?
[01:45:07.231 --> 01:45:10.213]  You know that the economy is getting worse, but there is hope.
[01:45:10.533 --> 01:45:14.816]  Robert Beatles' new book, Here's What You Do, tells you what to do and how to do it.
[01:45:15.056 --> 01:45:18.398]  Even a 10-year-old can figure it out after reading this 72-page book.
[01:45:18.618 --> 01:45:19.358]  And the best part?
[01:45:19.519 --> 01:45:21.280]  This book is priced under $10.
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:22.400]  Don't be the victim.
[01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:23.221]  Be a victor.

[01:45:25.582 --> 01:45:27.223]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[01:45:27.444 --> 01:45:28.744]  Again, hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[01:45:29.625 --> 01:45:31.126]  Wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[01:45:31.226 --> 01:45:35.529]  Is your financial advisor experienced enough to combat rising interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[01:45:51.139 --> 01:45:51.179]  877-479-8178.
[01:46:03.828 --> 01:46:05.529]  We're good.
[01:46:25.697 --> 01:46:27.258]  Here is the Attorney General.
[01:46:27.398 --> 01:46:40.506]  ...meeting and quotes the Koran and the scripture and says homosexual activities are immoral and he's attacked by a gay activist.
[01:46:43.008 --> 01:46:45.969]  Well, the statute would not necessarily cover that.
[01:46:46.570 --> 01:46:53.274]  On the other hand, I think that... So is there a reason for someone to think that this is odd?
[01:46:54.090 --> 01:46:57.974]  Does that strike you as odd that one might be a crime and another one not?
[01:46:59.155 --> 01:47:02.179]  We're talking about crimes that have a historic basis.
[01:47:02.419 --> 01:47:13.571]  Groups who have been targeted for violence as a result of the color of their skin, their sexual orientation, that is what this statute is designed to cover.
[01:47:14.113 --> 01:47:15.634]  Well, I think that's part of the problem.
[01:47:15.674 --> 01:47:17.254]  The elderly are not protected groups.
[01:47:17.294 --> 01:47:19.255]  Security guards are not protected groups.
[01:47:19.295 --> 01:47:21.276]  Soldiers are apparently not protected groups.
[01:47:21.416 --> 01:47:25.017]  Some are protected groups and get special protection under this law.
[01:47:25.577 --> 01:47:26.938]  But one has to look at
[01:47:27.799 --> 01:47:31.362]  The unfortunate history of our nation.
[01:47:32.422 --> 01:47:42.850]  There are groups who have been singled out, who have been the objects of violence simply because of their sexual orientation, the color of their skin, their ethnicity.
[01:47:44.011 --> 01:47:46.532]  We have to face and confront that reality.
[01:47:47.053 --> 01:47:52.196]  That which historically has been a problem for that nation continues to be a problem for this nation.
[01:47:53.657 --> 01:47:57.620]  Alright folks, we'll play the rest coming up next hour.
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:00.362]  But the point here is, we're going to go back to Ted Pike.
[01:48:01.723 --> 01:48:06.467]  I grew up in Dallas, Texas and I had black friends on the football team and I went over to their house and hung out on the weekends.
[01:48:08.448 --> 01:48:16.134]  And a few times we were attacked by groups of other blacks going through a neighborhood because I was white.
[01:48:18.174 --> 01:48:24.340]  When whites get attacked, and there are many black-on-white crimes that are racially motivated, they don't get a hate crime charge.
[01:48:26.503 --> 01:48:27.644]  That's not happening in Europe.
[01:48:29.622 --> 01:48:33.963]  You notice, oh, America's bad, our history, i.e., white people are bad.
[01:48:34.343 --> 01:48:35.584]  And that's what this is all about.
[01:48:35.604 --> 01:48:37.164]  And it's about racial politics.
[01:48:37.544 --> 01:48:39.625]  And whites are basically almost part of the minority.
[01:48:39.645 --> 01:48:40.645]  They're mainly elderly.
[01:48:41.706 --> 01:48:44.727]  And, uh, you know, the so-called majority is elderly.
[01:48:45.067 --> 01:48:49.588]  And Laurie Conquista and others brag, you all, white people are all dying, we're going to get you, ah, ah, ah.
[01:48:50.108 --> 01:48:54.970]  And that's all cute and funny and Ford and Chevy and General Motors, you know, everybody funds that.
[01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:57.850]  Miller Brewing funds Metsch and La Raza.
[01:48:58.151 --> 01:48:59.091]  That's all okay.
[01:49:00.498 --> 01:49:05.320]  It's just, we're going to have select groups and the government's going to persecute groups.
[01:49:05.741 --> 01:49:09.022]  If a white guy kills a black guy, there's going to be a hate crime charge.
[01:49:09.042 --> 01:49:11.003]  But if a black guy kills a white guy, there's not.
[01:49:12.064 --> 01:49:14.645]  So this is the type of mind control, but it's worse than that.
[01:49:15.205 --> 01:49:26.351]  It's the federal nature of turning your local police into political officers that judge each crime off of whether it was racially or sexually motivated, but then it goes further.
[01:49:26.391 --> 01:49:27.732]  That was the old hate bills they wanted.
[01:49:27.972 --> 01:49:29.773]  This new one that Reverend Pike was just covering,
[01:49:30.765 --> 01:49:31.645]  This is a quick segment.
[01:49:31.665 --> 01:49:32.506]  We're about to go back to him.
[01:49:35.026 --> 01:49:37.047]  This thing says your speech.
[01:49:37.507 --> 01:49:41.909]  If you made somebody not like somebody else and you hurt their feelings, you're going to prison.
[01:49:41.969 --> 01:49:43.029]  This is the Soviet Union.
[01:49:43.289 --> 01:49:46.350]  We're about to break, but Reverend Pike, break down.
[01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:47.710]  This happened in the Soviet Union.
[01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:53.072]  Hate crime, sensitivity training, all of this stuff was done before.
[01:49:54.012 --> 01:49:54.953]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:49:55.053 --> 01:49:55.433]  In fact,
[01:49:56.725 --> 01:50:11.897]  Lenin in 1918 put on a phonograph record which was sent all out throughout Russia that if anyone ever even said that any of the Bolshevik leaders were Jewish, it was an automatic death sentence.
[01:50:14.279 --> 01:50:15.420]  Automatic death sentence.
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:18.603]  And again, do we have free speech in America or not?
[01:50:19.924 --> 01:50:23.727]  Well, this is going to be determined next Wednesday on how the people respond.
[01:50:24.639 --> 01:50:25.719]  Well, my God, folks.
[01:50:25.779 --> 01:50:26.620]  Total tyranny.
[01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:29.821]  No one is safe if they allow this to pass.
[01:50:29.881 --> 01:50:33.343]  And they want to turn the SWAT teams and police loose on you.
[01:50:34.023 --> 01:50:36.264]  They want to take your property, and they are coming.
[01:50:36.324 --> 01:50:37.444]  This is the Red Terror.
[01:50:37.684 --> 01:50:39.105]  Ted Pike, back in 70 seconds.
[01:50:41.546 --> 01:50:44.927]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:51:52.781 --> 01:51:54.703]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:55.163 --> 01:51:57.967]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:52:21.445 --> 01:52:23.709]  The end of the First Amendment, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:23.789 --> 01:52:25.352]  The end of freedom.
[01:52:25.673 --> 01:52:27.577]  But look, these criminals can pass this law.
[01:52:27.597 --> 01:52:28.458]  I'm not following it.
[01:52:29.753 --> 01:52:32.815]  But the point is, they're trying it, they're very close to passing it, it's real.
[01:52:32.895 --> 01:52:38.058]  Okay, Reverend Ted Pike, please continue with the history of this, and then now, what's in this bill?
[01:52:38.779 --> 01:52:48.285]  Specifically, because they're on the news admitting, and the bill says if you influence somebody by your speech, not even calling for violence, you go to prison.
[01:52:48.365 --> 01:52:53.448]  I mean, this is just off the charts anti-American, anti-freedom.
[01:52:55.234 --> 01:52:56.555]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:52:57.135 --> 01:53:01.058]  If we want to know where this bill is heading, you just have to go up to Canada.
[01:53:01.478 --> 01:53:15.927]  In Canada, in 1971, ADL, B'nai B'rith, after ten years of lobbying, they finally persuaded Parliament in Ottawa, just minutes before the Christmas vacation, to adopt their federal hate crimes law for Canada.
[01:53:16.267 --> 01:53:18.048]  That's Section 319.
[01:53:18.568 --> 01:53:22.411]  And the government also, about ten years later, adopted an anti-
[01:53:22.851 --> 01:53:42.595]  The so-called anti-hate internet law, section 13.1, and what that says is that if your speech is even likely to cause humiliation or hurt or wounded feelings in some member of a federally protected group, then that is a federal hate crime and you can have a $5,000 minimum
[01:53:45.776 --> 01:53:51.882]  Excuse me, a pride, but if you continue in such statements, you will go to prison.
[01:53:52.282 --> 01:53:57.406]  And the cyberbullying bill, as we mentioned earlier, is exactly like the Canadian law.
[01:53:57.446 --> 01:54:06.294]  It says that if you even intend to cause emotional, severe emotional distress in another person, then you can go to prison for two years.
[01:54:06.534 --> 01:54:09.736]  You don't even have to cause emotional distress in them.
[01:54:10.037 --> 01:54:11.498]  You just have to intend it.
[01:54:11.858 --> 01:54:14.960]  So these ADL laws are all thought crimes laws.
[01:54:15.001 --> 01:54:18.663]  They are very subjective, very nebulous and unclear.
[01:54:18.883 --> 01:54:24.007]  They're just wide open for expansion, clarification by federal judges.
[01:54:24.107 --> 01:54:37.798]  If this bill is passed, very quickly, contrary to what ADL tells legislators, they say, oh, this is only a bill to prosecute violent hate crimes in the states when the states can't or won't enforce the law.
[01:54:37.838 --> 01:54:40.500]  But the truth is, as soon as this bill is passed,
[01:54:41.352 --> 01:54:52.060]  And the government begins to lay down indictments against people, even for violent hate crimes, then the liberal judges will begin to pontificate from the bench.
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:58.224]  They will very quickly say, oh no, we have to do more than just protect homosexuals, Jews, etc.
[01:54:58.584 --> 01:55:00.746]  from violent physical hate crimes.
[01:55:01.006 --> 01:55:04.268]  We need to protect their delicate emotions and self-esteem.
[01:55:04.608 --> 01:55:08.051]  We will have to legislate and to pontificate
[01:55:08.671 --> 01:55:17.118]  Uh, adjudicate, I should say, against those, that verbal violence that goes across the airwaves and out of the pulpit and so on.
[01:55:17.398 --> 01:55:21.882]  So this is a very slippery slope that this hate bill will take, take us immediately.
[01:55:22.142 --> 01:55:27.646]  And again, I have to, I have to repeat, we can, we can kill this hate bill next week.
[01:55:28.066 --> 01:55:33.531]  If Americans now will call their senators today, immediately after this program,
[01:55:33.991 --> 01:55:50.121]  Call them, and just ask them, would they like to watch this shocking video that shows the Attorney General of the United States, Holder, saying, spitting it out, that there is no equal protection under the hate bill.
[01:55:50.441 --> 01:55:57.445]  Tell the staffers to go immediately to truthtellers.org, there on the homepage, you'll see the Attorney General,
[01:55:58.385 --> 01:55:58.785]  I think?
[01:56:13.513 --> 01:56:18.555]  But that's what the bill, I mean that's what the bill says, and it says the feds basically, they choose.
[01:56:18.615 --> 01:56:28.077]  Just like with the green carbon tax, the bill that's passed the house gives these federal boards, 30 plus agencies, unlimited power on anything producing carbon.
[01:56:28.337 --> 01:56:32.579]  So the media's always, it's only on big power plants and coal plants.
[01:56:32.939 --> 01:56:36.320]  It's not on you, but then you read the bill, it's on everything!
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:46.008]  And we already have enough of a chilling effect in this country, so right when people are mad, tired of the tyranny, they're creating these new political crimes.
[01:56:46.429 --> 01:56:47.290]  Yes.
[01:56:47.390 --> 01:56:49.932]  And turning our police into political officers.
[01:56:49.952 --> 01:56:56.658]  We're going to come back and play some more A Holder in testimony, and a lot more with our guest Ted Pike.
[01:56:56.718 --> 01:56:57.219]  Stay with us.
[01:56:59.585 --> 01:57:03.588]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:57:03.828 --> 01:57:05.609]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:14.116]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:57:14.356 --> 01:57:19.579]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:21.521]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:57:21.761 --> 01:57:28.105]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:57:28.285 --> 01:57:39.033]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:57:39.333 --> 01:57:39.833]  That's right.
[01:57:40.093 --> 01:57:42.395]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:57:42.655 --> 01:57:44.396]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.

[01:57:59.623 --> 01:58:05.184]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[01:58:05.484 --> 01:58:06.644]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:58:06.784 --> 01:58:10.745]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around called Inner Food.
[01:58:11.065 --> 01:58:19.207]  My wife just loves the stuff and now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his editor's choice award for best superfood of 2009.
[01:58:20.347 --> 01:58:22.908]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[01:58:23.228 --> 01:58:24.709]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[01:58:24.969 --> 01:58:27.750]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[01:58:27.971 --> 01:58:29.431]  And their formula really works.
[01:58:29.691 --> 01:58:32.233]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:58:32.513 --> 01:58:33.773]  Try the NutriCafe.
[01:58:33.993 --> 01:58:38.395]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boost the immune system.
[01:58:38.756 --> 01:58:40.957]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:58:41.197 --> 01:58:43.458]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:58:43.638 --> 01:58:45.399]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:58:45.739 --> 01:58:46.859]  Go to www.

[01:59:00.043 --> 01:59:03.564]  ...MZ in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[01:59:03.765 --> 01:59:06.185]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[01:59:06.325 --> 01:59:15.828]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life, that even when you do a great job for someone, and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[01:59:16.008 --> 01:59:21.895]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[01:59:22.215 --> 01:59:24.718]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[01:59:24.919 --> 01:59:34.630]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[01:59:34.650 --> 01:59:35.310]  I think so.
[02:00:01.593 --> 02:00:07.618]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:00:08.238 --> 02:00:11.281]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:14.083 --> 02:00:16.965]  We're talking with Ted Pike, through tellers.org.
[02:00:17.005 --> 02:00:19.748]  I'm Alex Jones with infowares.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:00:21.389 --> 02:00:28.514]  And I have the national, international media attacking me on a weekly basis in national publications.
[02:00:29.642 --> 02:00:31.323]  Saying I'm causing murders.
[02:00:32.383 --> 02:00:36.124]  You've got 300 million people in this country.
[02:00:36.144 --> 02:00:39.665]  You're going to have a few lunatics that kill folks from time to time.
[02:00:41.785 --> 02:00:43.246]  I don't deserve to be blamed for this.
[02:00:43.386 --> 02:00:44.926]  Plus, I'm not calling for it.
[02:00:45.466 --> 02:00:49.187]  And it turns out that Von Brun actually didn't like me and neither did Poplosky.
[02:00:49.707 --> 02:00:54.909]  But regardless, to say that you're guilty
[02:00:56.209 --> 02:01:03.572]  Because they say you're guilty, not even for your speech, but they say something you said may have made this person commit these crimes.
[02:01:03.632 --> 02:01:09.055]  A few months ago, I was wondering, why does the media keep trying to, with no connection, to connect me to these people?
[02:01:10.636 --> 02:01:12.716]  And their questions, are you causing them to kill?
[02:01:12.736 --> 02:01:13.597]  Do you feel guilty?
[02:01:13.637 --> 02:01:14.597]  Should you get in trouble?
[02:01:15.037 --> 02:01:16.318]  They're getting fed the line.
[02:01:16.338 --> 02:01:20.340]  Then I found out, in my case, the Southern Poverty Law Center is on my butt.
[02:01:21.755 --> 02:01:28.260]  And the ADL's been caught breaking into police stations and stealing files on people, and they're the ones that train the local police.
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:29.481]  I mean, this is brainwashing.
[02:01:29.501 --> 02:01:42.952]  And then I've seen it in the news, where people get arrested for giving the police Ron Paul videos, or my films, or get arrested for an anti-UN sticker on their car, and the MIAC and DHS report, and now Homeland Security.
[02:01:43.513 --> 02:01:48.197]  Holder has a bill where he will put you on the terror list for your political speech.
[02:01:48.877 --> 02:01:49.898]  And they're already doing this.
[02:01:50.138 --> 02:01:52.220]  It won't say why a million-plus people are on it.
[02:01:52.540 --> 02:01:59.645]  And they have a bill where if you're on the no-fly, no-judge, no-jury, extrajudicial, you're going to be on the no-buy list for guns.
[02:02:00.045 --> 02:02:03.408]  They're saying if you have bad credit, you're going to be on the no-fly list, and then no guns.
[02:02:03.868 --> 02:02:13.855]  So, it's not just the hate bill, or the cyberbullying bill, or the DHS reports, or the no-fly, no-buy, or this new bill I covered yesterday.
[02:02:13.875 --> 02:02:14.616]  I've got it here on the stack.
[02:02:14.636 --> 02:02:16.658]  I'll give you the bill number if I can dig it out.
[02:02:17.642 --> 02:02:21.044]  They're now saying, oh, and saying there's a New World Order is hate.
[02:02:21.705 --> 02:02:22.805]  That's code word.
[02:02:22.825 --> 02:02:23.846]  And we're like, what?
[02:02:25.227 --> 02:02:28.429]  Even if it was code word for something, it's your First Amendment, but it's not!
[02:02:28.890 --> 02:02:39.357]  David Icke wrote a book believing that space aliens control the world, and he was arrested in Canada, and they said space aliens is code for Jews.
[02:02:39.877 --> 02:02:45.281]  So there's also a rampant, like, Hitlerian or Soviet-style paranoia
[02:02:46.101 --> 02:02:48.623]  Where... I mean, this is a reign of terror.
[02:02:48.643 --> 02:02:49.824]  This is so un-American.
[02:02:50.124 --> 02:03:07.095]  Ted Pike, break down more of how they're federalizing our local police and can you elaborate on my point that this is just a nexus for other things in this... I keep calling it Soviet because it's particularly Soviet, of secret lists and secret arrests and no judge, no jury.
[02:03:07.155 --> 02:03:09.137]  I mean, this is incredible, Ted Pike.
[02:03:09.517 --> 02:03:16.604]  Well, it's extremely important that we defeat the hate bill, because the hate bill is kind of the flagship of other hate bills.
[02:03:16.724 --> 02:03:19.747]  It's the biggest hit on the Hydra, or it's the body of the Hydra.
[02:03:20.008 --> 02:03:20.468]  That's right.
[02:03:20.488 --> 02:03:25.994]  The big federal hate bill is a broad bill which will end free speech in America.
[02:03:26.354 --> 02:03:33.482]  But we have to realize that there are basically three civil rights hate crimes, bias crimes bills now before Congress.
[02:03:33.502 --> 02:03:35.104]  The first, of course, is the Hate Bill.
[02:03:35.964 --> 02:03:39.989]  But there's also ENDA, which is the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.
[02:03:40.009 --> 02:03:43.913]  That's now in three committees in the House Judiciary.
[02:03:44.193 --> 02:03:47.377]  The ENDA is the ADL's workplace.
[02:03:48.057 --> 02:03:55.701]  Uh, hate crimes law which makes it a federal offense to deny employment to a homosexual because he's a homosexual.
[02:03:55.841 --> 02:03:57.782]  And then that federalizes everything.
[02:03:58.062 --> 02:03:58.903]  That's right.
[02:03:58.983 --> 02:04:04.905]  And brings the feds in and weird sensitivity training when nobody is even talking or thinking about this.
[02:04:05.246 --> 02:04:08.547]  It's like forcing sex ed on third graders.
[02:04:09.248 --> 02:04:09.908]  It's perverted.
[02:04:10.585 --> 02:04:18.595]  That's right, and it also will force churches to hire homosexuals in non-clerical, non-clergy positions.
[02:04:18.735 --> 02:04:23.420]  So Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[02:04:23.721 --> 02:04:27.465]  This is the end of free association, free market, property rights.
[02:04:27.625 --> 02:04:52.141]  Yeah, now if we can defeat the hate bill this week, perhaps as early as this week, if we can flood the Senate with this request that the staffers and the senators watch this very embarrassing, very damaging video with Holder admitting there's no equal protection and there's no need on the local level for a hate crimes bill, there is a good chance we can knock it in the head this week.
[02:04:52.181 --> 02:04:57.565]  But we're going to have to have massive calling in to the Congress immediately after this program.
[02:04:57.625 --> 02:04:58.527]  Oh yes, uh huh.
[02:05:06.474 --> 02:05:09.336]  Yeah, I'm doing constantly broadcasting.
[02:05:09.896 --> 02:05:18.242]  This is coming to a head because the Senate Majority Leader says he's got to have the hate bill passed by the August recess.
[02:05:18.742 --> 02:05:22.485]  And if the arms appreciation... Because they know Obama's stalling and losing power by then.
[02:05:22.505 --> 02:05:26.827]  They've got to pass the green takeover, the carbon tax enslavement.
[02:05:27.128 --> 02:05:28.348]  They've got to pass the gun grabbing.
[02:05:28.368 --> 02:05:29.729]  They've got to pass the open borders.
[02:05:29.749 --> 02:05:32.771]  They've got to get it all by the winter.
[02:05:33.852 --> 02:05:39.479]  The reason I brought up doing interviews, I've been doing a lot of national and regional shows myself lately.
[02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:42.803]  And they'll say, Alex, what's most important right now?
[02:05:42.823 --> 02:05:45.066]  And I'll go, well, the hate bill and the cyberbullying bill.
[02:05:45.527 --> 02:05:47.269]  And I'll read the subsections on air.
[02:05:47.749 --> 02:05:50.152]  And these talk show hosts are shocked.
[02:05:50.633 --> 02:05:51.854]  They aren't even aware of it.
[02:05:52.785 --> 02:05:54.605]  Because there's such a news blackout.
[02:05:54.745 --> 02:05:56.586]  That's why we're so blessed to have you.
[02:05:56.606 --> 02:06:15.990]  So I would also encourage listeners to get the stories that Kurt Nemo has written off InfoWars.com, off PrisonPlanet.com, to get the reports off TrueTellers.org, to get the video clip from YouTube that you're linked to, and pass that on, the direct link to people, so they can see this for themselves.
[02:06:16.970 --> 02:06:19.931]  So not just calling the Senate, or is it just best to call the Senate?
[02:06:20.031 --> 02:06:36.160]  Well, right now, you see, we only have several days' time to do this, because if they have a markup session as early as next Tuesday in the Senate Judiciary, the Heat Bill then will be predestined to go forward very rapidly.
[02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:42.564]  They could have a markup session and the liberals there could vote to move it forward as an amendment.
[02:06:43.584 --> 02:06:45.526]  Why did you say Monday?
[02:06:45.606 --> 02:06:46.487]  It could be by Friday.
[02:06:46.527 --> 02:06:49.410]  We've obviously won some battles since I was reading your site Monday.
[02:06:59.608 --> 02:07:06.938]  Yeah, but you see the margin in the House, we had a massive margin in favor of the hate bill, something like 74 votes.
[02:07:07.358 --> 02:07:08.580]  In the Senate, it's different.
[02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:10.522]  It's much more dicey.
[02:07:11.644 --> 02:07:16.109]  There's probably seven or eight votes in favor of the hate bill over the Republicans.
[02:07:16.630 --> 02:07:31.026]  But what we have to do is destabilize the Democrats letting them know in no uncertain terms that if they do vote for this hate bill, that we the people, we're going to remember because the midterm elections are coming up fairly soon.
[02:07:31.066 --> 02:07:35.551]  And one of the reasons the Democrats want to rush it through is because they want to get this past them.
[02:07:35.811 --> 02:07:42.793]  This pro-pedophile hate bill is not going to sound very well in the Fallen Bites a year from now at midterms.
[02:07:42.853 --> 02:07:52.695]  They want to get this Orwellian anti-Christian legislation taken care of now, so that the family can emphasize family values for the next half of this Congress.
[02:07:52.715 --> 02:07:54.575]  So, right now is the crucial hour.
[02:07:54.595 --> 02:07:56.215]  We've got to get those calls going in.
[02:07:56.716 --> 02:07:59.576]  Again, the toll-free number to your Senator is 877-851-8000.
[02:08:04.349 --> 02:08:08.534]  6 4 3 7 again that's 8 7 7 8 5 1 6 4 3 7 and the backup toll number is 202 225 3 1 2 1 that's 202 225
[02:08:20.981 --> 02:08:24.084]  3-1-2-1, and just give them this simple message.
[02:08:24.425 --> 02:08:33.395]  Have you watched the shocking video that shows Attorney General Holder saying there is no equal protection under the hate bill?
[02:08:33.935 --> 02:08:36.958]  It's on the homepage at truthtellers.org.
[02:08:37.159 --> 02:08:39.982]  Well, I mean, Reverend Ted Pike, there is no doubt
[02:08:41.055 --> 02:08:42.516]  That these people are out of control.
[02:08:42.656 --> 02:08:46.979]  I mean, the hate bill, I agree with you, is the big hot topic right now.
[02:08:46.999 --> 02:08:48.500]  It's what they're trying to pass right now.
[02:08:48.940 --> 02:08:50.201]  But you look at everything else.
[02:08:50.241 --> 02:08:53.743]  The seizure of all energy production and all human activity.
[02:08:53.844 --> 02:08:55.144]  Taxing the carbon cycle.
[02:08:56.485 --> 02:08:57.406]  What plants breathe.
[02:08:57.446 --> 02:08:58.306]  Carbon dioxide.
[02:08:58.347 --> 02:09:00.668]  Saying what plants breathe is a deadly poison.
[02:09:00.808 --> 02:09:02.629]  Listing it as a deadly poison now.
[02:09:02.649 --> 02:09:03.610]  I mean, this is insanity.
[02:09:05.473 --> 02:09:15.421]  The start trying to start new wars, the anti-gun bills, the likes of which we've never seen, and then all these hoax articles in the mainstream saying there is no gun bills.
[02:09:15.721 --> 02:09:17.383]  You know, why are people buying guns?
[02:09:18.323 --> 02:09:24.368]  I really see this all coming to a collision, because it looks like the establishment is bum-rushing right now.
[02:09:24.708 --> 02:09:31.754]  Are they doing that out of strength, or are they doing that out of desperation, realizing that the people are becoming wise to their new world order?
[02:09:31.974 --> 02:09:32.815]  Well I think they are.
[02:09:32.895 --> 02:09:34.497]  They're doing it out of desperation.
[02:09:34.517 --> 02:09:48.752]  The ADL has global ambitions and it's in a race with the new alternative media of the internet, talk radio and so on, which is spilling the beans about their role as the architect of most of this legislation.
[02:09:49.172 --> 02:09:52.456]  But we have to realize that yes, these are all
[02:09:53.036 --> 02:10:08.961]  Other great concerns, these other bills are very threatening, but if we lose speech under the federal hate crimes bill, we will lose all our other freedoms, our freedoms to criticize these other pieces of very threatening legislation.
[02:10:08.981 --> 02:10:17.864]  So number one priority, this is kind of the beating heart of our republic, is to keep that precious free speech alive.
[02:10:18.104 --> 02:10:21.125]  The hate bill is a sword pointed at our free speech.
[02:10:21.465 --> 02:10:23.968]  Well, I agree with you, Ted, but let's expand.
[02:10:23.988 --> 02:10:25.750]  Let's say they do pass it and try to implement it.
[02:10:26.090 --> 02:10:27.672]  We've then got to fight it every step of the way.
[02:10:27.712 --> 02:10:29.234]  I mean, for those that don't know, you know them.
[02:10:29.514 --> 02:10:30.115]  I've had them on.
[02:10:30.415 --> 02:10:36.982]  It's mainstream news that in Philadelphia, preachers that come out to street corners and preach are charged with hate crime.
[02:10:37.823 --> 02:10:39.525]  By the state and taken to prison.
[02:10:40.165 --> 02:10:41.806]  And then huge court battles ensued.
[02:10:41.866 --> 02:10:44.188]  These people, this is not just our opinion.
[02:10:44.688 --> 02:10:45.589]  They mean business.
[02:10:45.629 --> 02:10:52.454]  And folks, even if you disagree with somebody coming out and protesting you, the point is, if you take their freedom of speech, we live in a tyranny.
[02:10:52.834 --> 02:10:55.756]  I mean, I don't think people realize, Reverend, you're not joking.
[02:10:56.197 --> 02:11:00.180]  In fact, it's hard to describe just how real and hardcore this is.
[02:11:00.748 --> 02:11:05.732]  Yes, and it's spreading like a cancer to all the Western industrialized democracies.
[02:11:06.132 --> 02:11:07.793]  America is a holdout.
[02:11:08.013 --> 02:11:10.635]  We still do not have a federal hate crimes law.
[02:11:11.015 --> 02:11:11.255]  A.D.
[02:11:11.295 --> 02:11:22.463]  Weller wants to internationalize hate crimes enforcement with the right to deport people like Rudolph and Zondo and others.
[02:11:22.663 --> 02:11:25.926]  They want to have you arrested if you say global warming isn't real.
[02:11:26.346 --> 02:11:26.906]  That's right.
[02:11:27.127 --> 02:11:28.067]  They're very aggressive.
[02:11:31.568 --> 02:11:35.451]  Orwellian in their desires to basically take away all of our rights.
[02:11:35.991 --> 02:11:38.353]  All right, Pastor Ted Pike, TruthTellers.org.
[02:11:38.493 --> 02:11:41.475]  Thank you for the great work you're doing.
[02:11:42.156 --> 02:11:43.317]  Let me talk to you here behind the scenes.
[02:11:43.357 --> 02:11:44.417]  I may even hold you over if you can.
[02:11:44.477 --> 02:11:46.359]  If not, we'll go to our next guest.
[02:11:46.399 --> 02:11:51.362]  But I want to talk about what it would be like under the Soviet system, because really I've studied it.
[02:11:51.823 --> 02:11:55.586]  The corporate system is more fascist, but the implementation is more Soviet.
[02:11:55.606 --> 02:11:56.947]  It's kind of a hybrid.
[02:11:56.987 --> 02:11:58.728]  What will Soviet America be like?
[02:12:00.316 --> 02:12:02.078]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[02:12:02.358 --> 02:12:05.061]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[02:12:05.301 --> 02:12:07.243]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[02:12:07.543 --> 02:12:08.324]  Here's the story.
[02:12:08.524 --> 02:12:13.129]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[02:12:13.329 --> 02:12:14.350]  Now here's the bad news.
[02:12:14.591 --> 02:12:19.436]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures.
[02:12:19.676 --> 02:12:21.518]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[02:12:21.758 --> 02:12:25.979]  Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[02:12:26.379 --> 02:12:31.581]  All this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in the health care services.
[02:12:31.881 --> 02:12:33.741]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[02:12:34.081 --> 02:12:42.784]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[02:12:43.084 --> 02:12:47.985]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[02:12:48.265 --> 02:12:50.426]  I recommend you visit this important new website at
[02:12:50.666 --> 02:12:52.167]  MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[02:12:52.367 --> 02:12:54.028]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[02:12:54.329 --> 02:12:55.549]  Or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[02:12:55.589 --> 02:12:57.130]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:12:57.411 --> 02:12:57.531]  July 8, 2009.
[02:12:57.591 --> 02:13:00.052]  Gold opened this morning at $9.1740.
[02:13:00.092 --> 02:13:03.575]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.4391, $4.7195 for the half ounce, or $2.3598 for a quarter ounce.
[02:13:03.595 --> 02:13:04.075]  That's $9.4391, $4.7195, and $2.3598.
[02:13:17.762 --> 02:13:30.171]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11,110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[02:13:30.271 --> 02:13:33.373]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[02:13:33.473 --> 02:13:36.736]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[02:13:36.816 --> 02:13:39.638]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[02:13:39.898 --> 02:13:42.639]  Minus has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[02:13:42.699 --> 02:13:45.421]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:13:45.621 --> 02:13:47.762]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[02:13:47.882 --> 02:13:50.143]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:13:50.783 --> 02:13:54.505]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[02:13:54.525 --> 02:13:54.705]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:14:00.521 --> 02:14:05.828]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:14:06.328 --> 02:14:13.317]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[02:14:13.917 --> 02:14:20.085]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:14:20.485 --> 02:14:22.325]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:14:22.465 --> 02:14:24.886]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:14:24.966 --> 02:14:35.908]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:14:36.528 --> 02:14:37.828]  It's not about left or right.
[02:14:38.208 --> 02:14:39.569]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:46.310]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:14:46.974 --> 02:14:54.759]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:14:55.239 --> 02:14:56.380]  The Obama Deception.
[02:14:56.820 --> 02:14:58.061]  The people strike back.
[02:14:59.942 --> 02:15:05.925]  We are surrounded by harmful indoor air that can easily deliver many harmful toxins straight into our bodies.
[02:15:06.186 --> 02:15:07.026]  Take a deep breath.
[02:15:07.967 --> 02:15:14.250]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria, and dangerous ozone entering your lungs?
[02:15:14.471 --> 02:15:15.091]  Have a glass of
[02:15:16.101 --> 02:15:21.343]  Can you taste the harmful chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs, and numerous other chemicals?
[02:15:21.683 --> 02:15:22.463]  Of course you can't.
[02:15:22.723 --> 02:15:27.565]  The air that you breathe and the water you drink should help maintain good health, not take away from it.
[02:15:27.885 --> 02:15:36.128]  AirAndAqua.com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and water, and they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these toxins.

[02:15:57.530 --> 02:15:58.992]  Purify your life today!
[02:16:11.318 --> 02:16:12.700]  Is it getting better?
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:17.244]  Can you imagine federalizing local police?
[02:16:17.264 --> 02:16:18.085]  It's already happening.
[02:16:18.725 --> 02:16:21.588]  And making them political officers just like the Soviet Union.
[02:16:21.928 --> 02:16:27.394]  Pastor Ted Pike, I already see the media setting me up.
[02:16:27.654 --> 02:16:31.057]  Openly saying the New York Times, they've got to put gatekeepers on the web.
[02:16:31.918 --> 02:16:35.582]  The CEO of a news group.
[02:16:37.039 --> 02:16:41.600]  Rupert Murdoch's company saying, arrest bloggers, ban free speech.
[02:16:42.321 --> 02:16:47.442]  I mean, they really are starting to figure out that we're taking them on, and so they're going to try to get nasty.
[02:16:47.983 --> 02:16:55.465]  I don't see it succeeding, but if they pass this bill, under this Soviet model that they're adopting, what will happen to Alex Jones?
[02:16:56.015 --> 02:17:10.846]  Well, the broadcasting industry is going to start receiving guidelines from the FTC that language which might induce aid, abet, and so on, according to the 1968 law, Title 18, Section 2A, will now become indictable as a federal crime.
[02:17:15.309 --> 02:17:21.896]  And it'll be in the same category as inciting to a riot or shouting, fire in a crowded theater, things like that.
[02:17:22.397 --> 02:17:31.146]  And you'll be experiencing tremendous pressure coming down to force you to become much more neutral and bland in what you say.
[02:17:31.166 --> 02:17:36.913]  Again, if we want to know what American talk radio will be like, just go up to Canada.
[02:17:37.653 --> 02:17:50.876]  Up in Canada, you can talk about gardening, you can talk about sports, or whatever you want, but you cannot criticize federally protected groups, such as homosexuals, the Zionists, and so on, in specific terms.
[02:17:50.916 --> 02:17:59.277]  You certainly cannot, say, from the pulpit, or from the airwaves, if you're Christian broadcasters, that the Jews killed Christ 2,000 years ago.
[02:17:59.617 --> 02:18:02.038]  That is considered a hate crime in Canada.
[02:18:02.478 --> 02:18:10.484]  And it's also considered a hate crime in Canada to quote Leviticus, the Romans from the Bible, saying homosexuality is an abomination.
[02:18:10.825 --> 02:18:18.391]  That will give you an immediate $5,000 fine if that pastor ever preaches again on that subject from those verses.
[02:18:18.731 --> 02:18:22.874]  He is facing contempt of court charges, which means prison.
[02:18:24.936 --> 02:18:27.638]  And everybody's so cowed that
[02:18:28.911 --> 02:18:31.873]  The police are like desperate spiders in black holes.
[02:18:32.493 --> 02:18:38.217]  David Icke comes walking in saying, I think there's reptoids from planet, you know, whatever.
[02:18:38.237 --> 02:18:40.158]  And they say, that's code.
[02:18:40.238 --> 02:18:40.918]  Arrest him.
[02:18:41.399 --> 02:18:43.640]  And David's going, no brother, peace, love.
[02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:45.301]  It's flying saucers.
[02:18:45.701 --> 02:18:48.143]  You're not even allowed to talk about flying saucers up there.
[02:18:48.183 --> 02:18:48.823]  They arrest you.
[02:18:49.203 --> 02:18:50.104]  Everything is hate.
[02:18:50.564 --> 02:19:00.531]  Yeah, and there are so many other groups who want to get on the hate crimes bandwagon, claiming they have also been victimized by white Christian heterosexuals.
[02:19:00.571 --> 02:19:07.516]  What about all the black students in synagogues and stuff where they catch them putting the swastikas on themselves?
[02:19:07.777 --> 02:19:09.678]  This is clearly a political weapon.
[02:19:10.158 --> 02:19:16.221]  Oh yeah, and the media is in collusion with this, but there is no recourse.
[02:19:16.301 --> 02:19:24.984]  I mean, we just simply have got to keep this hate bill from passing, and I encourage everybody to come to truthtellers.org immediately after this program.
[02:19:25.325 --> 02:19:30.927]  Watch the whole video, it'll make your blood boil, and then get those calls off immediately.
[02:19:30.947 --> 02:19:35.109]  Sure, and we're going to go around just a moment one more time, but the minutes we have left here,
[02:19:36.147 --> 02:19:41.452]  Let's say it passes though and they start federalizing the police more and political officers show up.
[02:19:41.492 --> 02:19:43.094]  What do I do when the police show up here?
[02:19:43.114 --> 02:19:45.717]  I guess I just get in handcuffs and go to the prison.
[02:19:45.737 --> 02:19:46.317]  That's freedom.
[02:19:46.718 --> 02:19:48.379]  I mean, this isn't America.
[02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:49.861]  I'm not going along with it.
[02:19:50.261 --> 02:19:53.725]  And anybody that tries to arrest me for my political speech is a terrorist.
[02:19:54.437 --> 02:19:57.438]  Yeah, there's a lot of big talk out there.
[02:19:57.478 --> 02:20:02.379]  I hear on talk radio people say, we're going to fight, we're going to go to jail, we're not going to submit.
[02:20:02.419 --> 02:20:10.101]  But when you're facing 10 years in prison for criticizing federally protected groups, the people shut up pretty fast.
[02:20:10.121 --> 02:20:19.704]  And the record in Canada and all throughout Europe, Australia, is that people of independence and courage and liberty become very docile very quickly.
[02:20:21.744 --> 02:20:22.685]  Then the sky's the limit.
[02:20:22.705 --> 02:20:39.263]  Then the real raping, the taking of farms, the ranches, the CPSing the kids, the brainwashing the children, the indoctrinating fifth graders like Michael Jackson would do at the public schools, just basically will be ruled by Michael Jackson snapping turtles, and that's basically the end of it.
[02:20:44.167 --> 02:20:49.411]  I would even call them liberal.
[02:20:49.451 --> 02:20:52.713]  These are disgusting, anti-American, anti-free speech.
[02:20:52.753 --> 02:21:01.278]  You know, you may hate what I say, somebody may hate what Ted says, somebody may hate what Bill Clinton says, but they have a right to say it.
[02:21:01.899 --> 02:21:03.300]  This is the United States.
[02:21:04.628 --> 02:21:11.535]  And we need to all stand up against this and just realize this is another symptom of just how rotten Washington is.
[02:21:11.836 --> 02:21:13.537]  It isn't enough they're stealing us blind.
[02:21:13.778 --> 02:21:16.540]  They want to tell us to sit down and shut up or we'll be arrested.
[02:21:16.981 --> 02:21:18.282]  This is just outrageous.
[02:21:19.624 --> 02:21:21.626]  Reverend Ted Pike, fire those numbers out in closing.
[02:21:22.006 --> 02:21:33.329]  Yeah, the toll-free number to your member of the Senate is 877-851-6437 and the toll number is 202-225-3121.
[02:21:33.469 --> 02:21:38.230]  And just ask the staffers to watch the very disturbing video.
[02:21:38.570 --> 02:21:40.711]  Listen, we're going to have you up as this develops.
[02:21:40.751 --> 02:21:42.151]  Reverend Ted Pike, thank you so much.
[02:21:42.191 --> 02:21:43.451]  Godspeed, Thought Criminal.
[02:21:43.771 --> 02:21:44.251]  Thank you.
[02:21:44.772 --> 02:21:45.612]  Thank you, Thought Criminal.
[02:21:45.632 --> 02:21:46.452]  I'll say bye to you right now.
[02:21:50.296 --> 02:21:53.282]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:21:53.302 --> 02:21:56.928]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:59.912 --> 02:22:04.875]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:22:29.872 --> 02:22:30.172]  I think?
[02:22:59.491 --> 02:23:00.612]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:23:00.872 --> 02:23:02.673]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:23:02.873 --> 02:23:03.513]  Well, you should.
[02:23:03.854 --> 02:23:08.096]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:23:08.356 --> 02:23:08.836]  That's right.
[02:23:09.157 --> 02:23:17.601]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[02:23:17.801 --> 02:23:19.062]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[02:23:19.182 --> 02:23:20.323]  Plus, if you act fast.
[02:23:20.523 --> 02:23:26.145]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:23:26.506 --> 02:23:33.028]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:23:33.389 --> 02:23:38.571]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[02:24:00.615 --> 02:24:03.219]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:24:03.620 --> 02:24:08.608]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:24:08.948 --> 02:24:10.691]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:24:11.012 --> 02:24:15.759]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:24:15.979 --> 02:24:16.960]  How much do you want?
[02:24:17.160 --> 02:24:17.921]  When do you want it?
[02:24:18.301 --> 02:24:19.902]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:24:20.182 --> 02:24:21.003]  When will you need it?
[02:24:21.263 --> 02:24:23.325]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:24:23.445 --> 02:24:24.566]  Will there be any food?
[02:24:24.786 --> 02:24:26.127]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:24:26.327 --> 02:24:31.391]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:24:31.591 --> 02:24:34.633]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:24:34.653 --> 02:24:35.674]  We're good to go!
[02:25:00.060 --> 02:25:11.132]  Way up north to Alaska Way up north to Alaska North to Alaska Go north for Russia's home
[02:25:13.531 --> 02:25:16.752]  We have a national security state that we live in.
[02:25:17.372 --> 02:25:21.774]  The narcotics trafficking yalies who control the opium supply in the U.S.
[02:25:22.014 --> 02:25:27.616]  had lost their monopoly in the 20s, so they openly lobbied to criminalize drugs.
[02:25:27.676 --> 02:25:28.636]  They controlled the police.
[02:25:29.196 --> 02:25:32.758]  They could ship the opium and then produce it into heroin into the country.
[02:25:33.518 --> 02:25:37.640]  The cocaine that was in the Coca-Cola, they could ship it in, making it illegal and make larger profits.
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:39.881]  They set up the national security state in 47.
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:47.531]  And have been raping America and destroying our freedoms ever since and using us as a great engine of evil worldwide.
[02:25:48.833 --> 02:25:51.537]  And all over the United States, it's happened to me.
[02:25:52.138 --> 02:25:52.779]  In New York.
[02:25:53.789 --> 02:25:54.630]  It's happened in Canada.
[02:25:54.670 --> 02:25:55.730]  It's happened in D.C.
[02:25:56.150 --> 02:25:57.531]  But I watch families.
[02:25:57.631 --> 02:26:04.635]  I watch Cub Scouts with cameras taking photos of George Washington at the Washington Memorial or the obelisk or the White House.
[02:26:04.695 --> 02:26:08.598]  And security guards and police would come over and erase it and gripe at them.
[02:26:08.638 --> 02:26:12.060]  It was all about bossing us and letting us know we're now slaves.
[02:26:13.921 --> 02:26:16.502]  And I saw a story in the Washington Post a few weeks ago.
[02:26:16.602 --> 02:26:18.884]  Secret buildings you may not photograph.
[02:26:19.984 --> 02:26:22.726]  And this is out of the Washington Post.
[02:26:24.745 --> 02:26:30.511]  And people are at bus stops beside major buildings that don't even have fences around them.
[02:26:31.432 --> 02:26:33.334]  And there's no sign saying don't photograph.
[02:26:34.115 --> 02:26:37.539]  And they just run up and grab you and drag you in and interrogate you and erase your film.
[02:26:40.485 --> 02:26:42.707]  And I've been in D.C.
[02:26:42.868 --> 02:26:50.455]  outside the Lincoln Memorial, a hundred yards away, right by the reflecting palm of the camera taping, and they just come up and say, turn your camera off.
[02:26:51.116 --> 02:26:52.357]  Well, I'm here taping this.
[02:26:52.778 --> 02:26:53.518]  Well, what are you here for?
[02:26:53.538 --> 02:26:54.800]  It's First Amendment.
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:55.781]  I mean, there's people all over.
[02:26:56.621 --> 02:26:58.784]  Listen, pal, and they start getting their taser out.
[02:26:59.644 --> 02:27:00.565]  It's about to get bad.
[02:27:00.585 --> 02:27:02.848]  I think I'm going to put some clips of that in this new film I'm making.
[02:27:04.036 --> 02:27:06.318]  And the Federal Reserve will run over and say, turn the cameras off.
[02:27:06.618 --> 02:27:08.840]  He'll be in a park across the street and they'll go, well, it's America.
[02:27:08.860 --> 02:27:12.563]  And they'll just go, all right, deadly force, pal.
[02:27:12.583 --> 02:27:14.444]  This hasn't even been in the newspaper, you know.
[02:27:14.464 --> 02:27:16.386]  We're about to get serious here.
[02:27:16.786 --> 02:27:18.267]  You don't have freedom, slave.
[02:27:18.467 --> 02:27:19.328]  You work for us.
[02:27:19.368 --> 02:27:20.088]  You understand?
[02:27:20.469 --> 02:27:21.549]  You pay the taxes.
[02:27:21.730 --> 02:27:22.730]  You suck my boots.
[02:27:23.571 --> 02:27:24.512]  People go, yes, sir.
[02:27:25.432 --> 02:27:25.833]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:26.894 --> 02:27:27.134]  Whoa.
[02:27:28.435 --> 02:27:29.676]  I mean, that's what it is.
[02:27:29.716 --> 02:27:30.977]  Land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[02:27:31.877 --> 02:27:36.299]  Now, the mayor begged for the NSA cyber security snooping hub.
[02:27:36.639 --> 02:27:38.180]  They're building them all over the country.
[02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:39.520]  Utah just got one.
[02:27:39.580 --> 02:27:40.781]  Wyoming's getting one.
[02:27:40.801 --> 02:27:42.401]  Dallas just got one.
[02:27:42.441 --> 02:27:43.121]  San Antonio's.
[02:27:43.141 --> 02:27:44.842]  There's just scores of them.
[02:27:44.902 --> 02:27:46.483]  Giant multi-billion dollar facilities.
[02:27:46.703 --> 02:27:47.963]  The mayor begged for it.
[02:27:48.223 --> 02:27:51.425]  The city offered to give them the land at the old Sony plant.
[02:27:51.685 --> 02:27:53.746]  See, we don't have Sony plants anymore.
[02:27:54.246 --> 02:27:56.807]  We have NSA hubs, and that's your going to be your new job.
[02:27:57.407 --> 02:27:59.589]  And you gotta have somebody, you know, one half listening to the other half.
[02:28:00.049 --> 02:28:09.756]  Now, if you try to go up there by the Walmart parking lot across the street and show them the news article, it's out of the San Antonio Current, a great weekly newspaper, kind of like the Austin Chronicle.
[02:28:11.685 --> 02:28:16.186]  If you try to show the old Sony plant, it is over for you.
[02:28:16.646 --> 02:28:18.727]  And you can be at Walmart, across the street, anywhere.
[02:28:19.007 --> 02:28:30.609]  Now this system looks at the face scanning cameras on the street corners and other NSA facilities, reads your mail illegally, and ABC News admits they listen to your phone sex if you're talking to your wife from Iraq.
[02:28:30.729 --> 02:28:33.950]  And this is all non-terror related for U.S.
[02:28:33.990 --> 02:28:34.450]  citizens.
[02:28:36.152 --> 02:28:38.413]  And it's the NSA's new data mining facility.
[02:28:38.453 --> 02:28:40.115]  This is the only market hiring.
[02:28:40.135 --> 02:28:43.156]  Domestic CIA, spies, East German society.
[02:28:44.397 --> 02:28:48.600]  And so we have the reporter, Greg Swartz, who took this evil photo.
[02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:51.322]  Now again, they're surveilling you without warrants.
[02:28:51.342 --> 02:28:52.442]  They're tracking you.
[02:28:52.522 --> 02:28:53.903]  They're breaking the law.
[02:28:53.943 --> 02:28:59.667]  But you, as a local newspaper, you can't go over there and take a photo of them.
[02:29:00.107 --> 02:29:02.389]  So we have the thought criminal on
[02:29:03.334 --> 02:29:07.218]  And ladies and gentlemen, we have to go out and expose these illegal facilities more.
[02:29:08.019 --> 02:29:11.883]  Now the key is they came off of the facility, they grabbed him.
[02:29:12.164 --> 02:29:13.125]  He's going to tell us the story.
[02:29:13.385 --> 02:29:14.927]  Mr. Swartz, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:29:15.888 --> 02:29:16.849]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:29:16.889 --> 02:29:18.851]  I've been a big fan ever since Waking Life.
[02:29:19.812 --> 02:29:22.075]  Well, see now we know why you're in trouble, sir.
[02:29:22.095 --> 02:29:23.116]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:29:24.056 --> 02:29:33.281]  So, right off Military Drive there in San Antonio, right by Walmart, you don't dare show just one of the spook factories.
[02:29:33.301 --> 02:29:34.482]  This isn't supposed to exist.
[02:29:34.502 --> 02:29:36.142]  The NSA doesn't exist.
[02:29:36.182 --> 02:29:37.183]  We're not reading your email.
[02:29:37.223 --> 02:29:37.603]  Go ahead.
[02:29:38.183 --> 02:29:50.470]  Yeah, it's strange that this facility is located directly across the street from a 24-hour Walmart Supercenter, which doesn't seem like the most secretive location.
[02:29:53.032 --> 02:29:53.953]  You know, you've seen the picture.
[02:29:53.973 --> 02:29:56.595]  It's surrounded by barbed wire, but it looks fairly innocent.
[02:29:57.375 --> 02:30:03.660]  And, uh, I just walked along the sidewalk there, took about five or six pictures.
[02:30:04.341 --> 02:30:12.987]  I even chatted with a, uh, worker who was on the other side of the fence, uh, working on, uh... You talk to a fellow slave?
[02:30:13.548 --> 02:30:15.509]  You don't talk in a prison camp, America.
[02:30:15.529 --> 02:30:17.691]  Pal, did you have permission to talk to him?
[02:30:19.433 --> 02:30:20.413]  Well, I guess not.
[02:30:20.433 --> 02:30:21.434]  That's a hate crime.
[02:30:21.714 --> 02:30:23.496]  That's your Al-Qaeda, pal.
[02:30:23.976 --> 02:30:25.157]  We gotta get rid of the Bill of Rights.
[02:30:25.217 --> 02:30:26.398]  Al-Qaeda's trying to hurt us.
[02:30:26.839 --> 02:30:29.841]  Anyways, please continue.
[02:30:29.861 --> 02:30:31.602]  So you talked to one of the fellow slaves.
[02:30:32.663 --> 02:30:37.167]  Yeah, you know, I asked him about... He said he was a contractor.
[02:30:37.207 --> 02:30:39.028]  He'd come down from Maryland, I guess.
[02:30:39.048 --> 02:30:43.072]  They can't even get local people to do this.
[02:30:45.419 --> 02:30:51.763]  And so I was almost expecting him to come to grab me then for daring to, uh, uh, speak to this fellow.
[02:30:52.444 --> 02:30:59.549]  And so then I just walked back to the Walmart and I, I almost thought, gee, maybe they're actually not going to hassle me.
[02:30:59.609 --> 02:31:01.470]  And that's when the police car drove up.
[02:31:02.250 --> 02:31:07.374]  And it was one NSA officer and one local SAPD officer.
[02:31:07.595 --> 02:31:10.477]  Yeah, again, this is a Fed who engages in crimes every day.
[02:31:10.817 --> 02:31:11.798]  They always lied about it.
[02:31:11.858 --> 02:31:14.020]  Now it's admitted everything's read, everything's listened to.
[02:31:14.040 --> 02:31:14.680]  No freedom.
[02:31:15.021 --> 02:31:15.821]  End of America.
[02:31:16.282 --> 02:31:17.102]  Total treason.
[02:31:17.122 --> 02:31:22.467]  They get actual intercepts on 9-11 or told to stand down because that's just chatter to cover the op.
[02:31:23.706 --> 02:31:31.415]  And here they are with a local cop, it's the same everywhere, to enforce their violation of the First Amendment through color of law intimidation.
[02:31:31.475 --> 02:31:35.179]  So, they pull up, what happens to the slave next?
[02:31:39.983 --> 02:31:47.290]  They just sort of detained me right there in the Walmart lot, and that's where the entire detainment took place.
[02:31:47.530 --> 02:31:49.392]  I wasn't taken to any secret facilities.
[02:31:49.893 --> 02:31:51.795]  Let me give us a blow-by-blow.
[02:31:51.855 --> 02:31:55.758]  So you're sitting there, and there's his hand on his gun.
[02:31:55.798 --> 02:31:56.559]  What does he say?
[02:31:56.579 --> 02:31:58.341]  Does he say, stay right there?
[02:31:58.361 --> 02:32:02.365]  I mean, describe these two fellas for us, these two America killers.
[02:32:03.283 --> 02:32:16.874]  Yeah, well it was, I was right about to, I was approaching my car in the parking lot to get ready to leave and when they pulled up and it was mostly the NSA officer, you know, he asked me what I was doing over there.
[02:32:16.894 --> 02:32:23.419]  They're officers, they're not public servants, it's officers, authorities, officials, just calling the royalty.
[02:32:23.679 --> 02:32:25.540]  So the royalness approached you.
[02:32:25.781 --> 02:32:27.262]  What did the royalness say?
[02:32:28.112 --> 02:32:35.075]  He wanted to know who I was, what was I doing there, you know, so I told him, well, I'm a journalist with the local paper.
[02:32:36.536 --> 02:32:38.857]  We're doing a story on your new facility here.
[02:32:39.397 --> 02:32:47.521]  Yeah, if you were a Russian spy, you'd just go to the NASA CIA NSA run Google front, like we did, and show the facility right here.
[02:32:48.201 --> 02:32:48.562]  Right.
[02:32:48.782 --> 02:32:51.103]  I'd go to Google Street View and show you the whole facility.
[02:32:51.343 --> 02:32:54.004]  They just wanted to let you know, you're my punk!
[02:32:54.384 --> 02:32:55.285]  You're my bitch!
[02:32:56.260 --> 02:32:57.361]  This is my area!
[02:32:57.421 --> 02:32:58.142]  You get out of here!
[02:32:58.242 --> 02:32:58.822]  I rule!
[02:32:59.022 --> 02:33:00.163]  You just pay my check!
[02:33:00.384 --> 02:33:00.684]  Come here!
[02:33:01.445 --> 02:33:01.905]  Great!
[02:33:02.525 --> 02:33:04.047]  Anyway, so you say you're with the local paper.
[02:33:04.347 --> 02:33:05.888]  Oh my God, that's real Al-Qaeda!
[02:33:06.169 --> 02:33:08.531]  You know, you know, the Cyber Security Command has said on record...
[02:33:09.454 --> 02:33:14.397]  They have said on record their job is to wage war against alternative blogs and media.
[02:33:14.717 --> 02:33:16.418]  And one colonel, in fact, pull this up.
[02:33:17.059 --> 02:33:19.981]  Army colonel says kill bloggers, kill US citizens.
[02:33:20.001 --> 02:33:22.943]  Now see, they're training to take on America.
[02:33:23.143 --> 02:33:28.346]  We own their property and they ain't going to be able to fight us taking over and shipping our cocaine and heroin.
[02:33:28.906 --> 02:33:33.809]  We rule America now and you're not going to stop us, you little piece of garbage!
[02:33:34.350 --> 02:33:35.571]  We're the patriots!
[02:33:35.811 --> 02:33:36.951]  Ha ha ha!
[02:33:36.971 --> 02:33:37.672]  What else happened?
[02:33:38.419 --> 02:33:41.622]  Right, and then you know about half of them... I'm sorry, start over, start over.
[02:33:41.662 --> 02:33:43.543]  So he asks, why are you here, what are you doing?
[02:33:43.583 --> 02:33:47.907]  You say, I'm with the press, and they like just go, whoa, we just found an Al-Qaeda.
[02:33:48.487 --> 02:33:51.210]  Oh my God, we just got one of them, oh my God!
[02:33:51.230 --> 02:33:54.212]  I mean, because their main mission is taking on the media.
[02:33:54.232 --> 02:33:54.873]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:33:55.273 --> 02:33:56.794]  The Cyber Command is for attacking.
[02:33:57.034 --> 02:34:00.037]  This is an attack facility, like an attack submarine.
[02:34:00.397 --> 02:34:03.059]  It's not out there doing surveillance, it's attacking the web.
[02:34:03.099 --> 02:34:03.460]  Go ahead.
[02:34:04.628 --> 02:34:09.054]  They had to do a full background check on me, and I actually have no record.
[02:34:09.194 --> 02:34:11.518]  But that was false arrest.
[02:34:11.658 --> 02:34:13.120]  I'm going to try to shut up.
[02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:13.961]  I just get so excited.
[02:34:13.981 --> 02:34:14.602]  You've got the floor.
[02:34:14.962 --> 02:34:17.486]  Blah, blah, blah.
[02:34:17.826 --> 02:34:19.268]  The royal god is talking to you.
[02:34:19.288 --> 02:34:19.869]  Tell us what happened.
[02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:25.963]  It was mostly a lot of standing around while they were looking up my non-existent police record.
[02:34:26.643 --> 02:34:32.527]  And waiting and waiting and then that one NSA guy had to hear from his superior.
[02:34:32.967 --> 02:34:34.708]  And it was just a lot of waiting around.
[02:34:34.768 --> 02:34:44.354]  I think just a matter of intimidation to show, you know, if you try to look into these matters, this is what, at the very least, this is what we're going to have and we're going to waste a lot of your time.
[02:34:44.374 --> 02:34:49.617]  If I'd had any kind of record, then they probably would have detained me for further interrogation.
[02:34:50.609 --> 02:34:59.332]  Well let's be clear here, that was false arrest, false imprisonment, like the Soviet Union when they say line up, line up comrade, I'm going to run your background.
[02:34:59.592 --> 02:35:02.013]  What are you doing taking photos of the Kremlin?
[02:35:02.293 --> 02:35:03.874]  You're in a lot of trouble now!
[02:35:04.154 --> 02:35:06.475]  But see now, we're America so we can do it.
[02:35:06.655 --> 02:35:14.498]  Did you say, ever say, hey, you know, you got my license, you don't have any right to do this, you surveil us all day, illegally criminals, I'm leaving.
[02:35:16.044 --> 02:35:16.644]  Well, no.
[02:35:16.764 --> 02:35:18.085]  I kind of played along with them.
[02:35:18.125 --> 02:35:23.389]  I thought maybe it would be... I wanted to see what they were going to do if I didn't put up a fuss.
[02:35:23.529 --> 02:35:28.752]  Maybe it would have been a better story if I had put up a fuss, but I didn't really want to give them an excuse.
[02:35:28.772 --> 02:35:30.593]  So how does this end?
[02:35:31.334 --> 02:35:33.435]  You said they did want you to erase the photos, right?
[02:35:34.144 --> 02:35:36.546]  They asked me to erase the photos, yes.
[02:35:36.826 --> 02:35:43.171]  And I said to the gentleman, well, are you ordering me to erase these photos?
[02:35:43.191 --> 02:35:46.353]  He said, well, no, I'm asking you as a friend.
[02:35:46.873 --> 02:35:50.716]  As a friend who illegally spies on you every day criminally.
[02:35:50.736 --> 02:35:51.597]  Yeah.
[02:35:52.137 --> 02:35:55.620]  And I said, well, you know, in that case, I will refrain.
[02:35:55.660 --> 02:35:57.881]  I'd like to keep these photos, you know, for the story.
[02:35:57.901 --> 02:35:58.622]  That's why I took them.
[02:35:59.162 --> 02:36:09.926]  And so, you know, eventually after about 45 minutes of standing around and checking into my background and all, they let me go with the photos.
[02:36:11.127 --> 02:36:12.247]  Did they warn you, though?
[02:36:12.367 --> 02:36:14.868]  Did they warn you to not ever come back or don't do it again?
[02:36:15.768 --> 02:36:23.111]  No, no, they didn't really say anything that specifically, although obviously they got that message across.
[02:36:24.211 --> 02:36:25.632]  Have you seen the Washington Post article?
[02:36:25.672 --> 02:36:27.533]  They did do that in Virginia.
[02:36:29.011 --> 02:36:30.092]  Right, I saw that.
[02:36:30.112 --> 02:36:38.482]  You know, it's interesting, about half of this country's alternative weekly newspapers are yet to be gobbled up by big corporate conglomerates.
[02:36:38.522 --> 02:36:43.328]  So that's something they might still fear as far as the truth actually being told.
[02:36:43.348 --> 02:36:46.291]  Yeah, tell us about the San Antonio Al-Qaeda.
[02:36:46.371 --> 02:36:47.793]  I mean, the San Antonio current.
[02:36:47.893 --> 02:36:48.514]  Evil, evil.
[02:36:49.114 --> 02:36:57.281]  I mean, I'm being sarcastic, but on record, this cyber security command says it's going to go out and attack InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:36:57.301 --> 02:37:03.045]  They say they're going to attack alternative media, and then some of their operatives have said they may have to kill us.
[02:37:03.566 --> 02:37:04.326]  That's freedom, though.
[02:37:04.386 --> 02:37:06.128]  Killing the press is what America's all about.
[02:37:06.809 --> 02:37:12.452]  Yeah, well, if you're familiar with James Bamford, that's where I was inspired to write this story by his work.
[02:37:12.492 --> 02:37:17.574]  You know, his book, The Shadow Factories, was where we first heard about this new San Antonio data center.
[02:37:18.175 --> 02:37:24.858]  And from his research, it sounds like this data center may eventually be able to hold all the information in the world.
[02:37:24.978 --> 02:37:27.419]  So, it's quite a massive facility.
[02:37:27.459 --> 02:37:36.164]  And one of the reasons they put it here is because they got Microsoft to come along and take on another nearby facility, so there's some synergy there.
[02:37:37.076 --> 02:37:39.278]  Well, Microsoft is a NSA front.
[02:37:39.298 --> 02:37:43.021]  It was founded and set up by IBM to get around antitrust laws.
[02:37:43.081 --> 02:37:44.442]  It is a eugenics trust.
[02:37:46.364 --> 02:37:50.707]  A total of over $50 billion of Microsoft money has now been given to eugenics.
[02:37:51.508 --> 02:37:59.935]  Yeah, well that would add up because the NSA did not agree to put this facility in San Antonio until Microsoft committed to do the same.
[02:38:01.456 --> 02:38:01.897]  Yeah, no, no.
[02:38:01.957 --> 02:38:04.219]  Microsoft is the NSA some.
[02:38:05.287 --> 02:38:05.567]  Yeah.
[02:38:06.327 --> 02:38:07.887]  So they're going hand-in-hand there.
[02:38:08.088 --> 02:38:08.368]  Hey!
[02:38:08.628 --> 02:38:13.669]  Hey, it's all... The guys in this facility are all shooting their kids up with cancer, virus, mercury shots.
[02:38:13.689 --> 02:38:14.509]  You know, they love it!
[02:38:14.949 --> 02:38:21.750]  They're all drinking fluoride too, so hey guys, you don't like me out on the web watching this right now, you feel real tough about all the stuff you've done to me?
[02:38:21.990 --> 02:38:24.271]  Remember, your bosses are doing it all to you, because you know what?
[02:38:24.451 --> 02:38:29.472]  I'm right and you're wrong and I know what I'm talking about and you know it too, even though you're compartmentalized.
[02:38:29.712 --> 02:38:31.592]  So just take those shots and enjoy it.
[02:38:32.674 --> 02:38:40.720]  Well, yeah, I know, as I'm sure you know, Alex, the military has been responsible for all kinds of toxic contamination of the public in this country.
[02:38:40.740 --> 02:38:45.263]  Well, they openly spray it and they take their own troops.
[02:38:45.283 --> 02:38:50.707]  They go, we'll give you three days leave if you sign this form to let us test a flu bug on you.
[02:38:50.727 --> 02:38:52.308]  And they go, sure, I'll do it for America.
[02:38:52.328 --> 02:38:55.570]  And then they murder them with nerve gas, knowing it's going to kill them.
[02:38:55.850 --> 02:38:58.552]  And then I'm against murdering the troops, so I'm bad.
[02:38:58.932 --> 02:39:00.213]  See, and you're bad too, buddy.
[02:39:00.233 --> 02:39:01.054]  You've got to be watched.
[02:39:01.513 --> 02:39:04.074]  You don't like murder in the troops!
[02:39:04.614 --> 02:39:09.015]  They dumped all kinds of chemicals down the drains and contaminated the entire neighborhood.
[02:39:09.035 --> 02:39:14.596]  There's very high rates of cancer and birth defects in South San Antonio near that Air Force Base.
[02:39:15.196 --> 02:39:16.856]  And they deny that there's a connection.
[02:39:16.876 --> 02:39:28.559]  They even have put a gag order on a scientist who came in to study the liver cancer and found that some of the cancers in the area may be attributable to living above the plume coming from the base.
[02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:31.000]  See, that's patriotic.
[02:39:31.081 --> 02:39:33.622]  Small children dying all around us is America.
[02:39:33.642 --> 02:39:39.227]  God, you're some kind of sick commie freak against children dying of cancer!
[02:39:40.293 --> 02:39:46.036]  I bet you'd like us to live in the Soviet Union where you don't have a right to... Oh, I mean... I guess that's what we're becoming.
[02:39:46.496 --> 02:39:52.899]  See, see... See, the problem is they've always denied all this and I try to have fun with it, but I'm just getting sick of it.
[02:39:52.939 --> 02:39:55.161]  I mean, brother, I was in D.C.
[02:39:55.261 --> 02:39:57.622]  and I just sent more cameras up there to do interviews.
[02:39:57.662 --> 02:39:58.282]  It was the same thing.
[02:39:58.702 --> 02:39:59.623]  You can be in a park.
[02:40:00.894 --> 02:40:05.038]  A hundred yards away from a monument, and they run over and say, don't tape it, national security.
[02:40:05.098 --> 02:40:12.345]  I mean, it's all, they've given the security guards and cops the orders to go out and humiliate and boss and enslave.
[02:40:12.666 --> 02:40:25.078]  So what you got actually at an NSA base is almost reasonable, though it's not, but in their minds it is, compared to what, I mean, they've given the orders to let us know that we are slaves.
[02:40:27.025 --> 02:40:28.432]  That's an intimidation, yeah.
[02:40:31.266 --> 02:40:34.909]  Well, you know, whether or not it will change under Obama is, right, that's the big question.
[02:40:34.949 --> 02:40:36.690]  I know you're not too optimistic about that.
[02:40:38.252 --> 02:40:40.133]  I would like to hope that there's a chance.
[02:40:40.333 --> 02:40:58.568]  I'm not saying I believe it, but a chance that maybe, just maybe, Obama has actually infiltrated the New World Order power structure, which is the only way that you can change it to get up there, and maybe will turn out to be on our side, but he can't do anything too fast or they'll take him out.
[02:40:58.668 --> 02:40:59.929]  So it's going to be a
[02:41:00.936 --> 02:41:02.157]  Uh, careful process.
[02:41:03.398 --> 02:41:06.000]  Well, you know, they say hope springs eternal, my friend.
[02:41:06.020 --> 02:41:06.780]  Yes.
[02:41:06.941 --> 02:41:11.524]  And, uh, I see you have a website here outside the San Antonio Current.
[02:41:11.584 --> 02:41:14.106]  Is that thesmokingmirror.blogspot.com?
[02:41:14.646 --> 02:41:15.627]  Yeah, that's my blog.
[02:41:16.428 --> 02:41:17.929]  The Smoking Mirror.
[02:41:17.949 --> 02:41:21.992]  I'm sure cybersecurity, I bet you're getting a lot of hits from them right now.
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:26.883]  Yeah, this story has been published pretty widely.
[02:41:26.923 --> 02:41:28.024]  A lot of blogs picked it up.
[02:41:28.064 --> 02:41:30.165]  There seems to be a great interest in this topic.
[02:41:30.405 --> 02:41:39.692]  Well, hey, listen, I'm tempted if I get some time to go down there for a film and just set up with cameras and they come up and go, yeah, you've got a big spook base violating the Fourth Amendment right here.
[02:41:39.732 --> 02:41:41.493]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:41:41.533 --> 02:41:42.474]  I'm here videotaping it.
[02:41:42.734 --> 02:41:43.515]  Get out of my face.
[02:41:44.135 --> 02:41:44.676]  I'm not your slave.
[02:41:44.696 --> 02:41:46.437]  I don't think they'll get too much footage there.
[02:41:46.457 --> 02:41:48.899]  They'll be on you in about five minutes, probably.
[02:41:49.399 --> 02:41:50.540]  They'll be what in five minutes?
[02:41:53.038 --> 02:41:55.320]  They'll be in your face in about five minutes.
[02:41:55.660 --> 02:41:56.180]  No, that's good.
[02:41:56.261 --> 02:41:57.802]  Then they'll have to arrest me.
[02:41:57.822 --> 02:41:59.483]  Because I'm sick of being a slave.
[02:41:59.723 --> 02:42:00.804]  I'm sick of their crimes.
[02:42:01.004 --> 02:42:03.406]  I'm sick of them shipping narcotics into the country.
[02:42:04.207 --> 02:42:04.847]  Absolutely.
[02:42:05.087 --> 02:42:06.188]  I'm sick of their crap.
[02:42:06.228 --> 02:42:07.349]  You're a criminal government.
[02:42:07.409 --> 02:42:08.030]  Everybody knows it.
[02:42:08.050 --> 02:42:08.810]  You're illegitimate.
[02:42:09.131 --> 02:42:16.997]  A bunch of offshore banks raping us, and now you're setting up goon centers everywhere, playing God, while your own kids all die of diseases they've shot them up with.
[02:42:17.887 --> 02:42:21.448]  I just am sick of all of them calling themselves patriots.
[02:42:21.468 --> 02:42:22.828]  You're a bunch of sicko filth.
[02:42:23.489 --> 02:42:29.430]  No, I'm saying, I'm saying we need more people to go down there and exercise the First Amendment against these goons.
[02:42:29.790 --> 02:42:30.511]  Right, right.
[02:42:30.531 --> 02:42:38.653]  Yeah, if a whole march of people went down there, then yeah, they might have a tougher time detaining everyone.
[02:42:39.505 --> 02:42:46.712]  And I'm sick of their DHS report saying there's no New World Order when I got the Pope and Al Gore coming up saying it on the other side.
[02:42:47.012 --> 02:42:49.715]  Mr. Swartz, we appreciate you coming on.
[02:42:50.075 --> 02:42:53.038]  We appreciate you doing all the great work you're doing and your coverage.
[02:42:53.418 --> 02:42:54.499]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:42:54.519 --> 02:42:55.340]  Maybe I'll come down there.
[02:42:55.360 --> 02:42:56.961]  Alright, thanks Alex.
[02:42:57.302 --> 02:42:57.682]  Thank you.
[02:42:57.722 --> 02:42:58.763]  There goes another thought criminal.
[02:43:00.603 --> 02:43:05.806]  Now that you've planted your organic garden, how will you keep the bugs away without using toxic chemicals and poisons?
[02:43:06.267 --> 02:43:10.609]  The answer is all natural insecticides from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[02:43:10.749 --> 02:43:16.493]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP to kill parasites.
[02:43:16.733 --> 02:43:25.058]  We then add a small amount of pyrethrin from chrysanthemum flowers and a mild attractant to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[02:43:25.358 --> 02:43:28.000]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.
[02:43:28.300 --> 02:43:38.787]  Our natural insecticides work in the home, on plants, and in your garden, killing pests mechanically, not with poisons, so pests can't develop an immunity and they won't harm your children or pets.
[02:43:39.168 --> 02:43:48.714]  It's effective against white flies, moths, bedbugs, fleas, roaches, crickets, and more, and safe enough to use on your pets, ridding them of fleas and other pests.
[02:43:49.015 --> 02:43:52.137]  Order now from FreshwaterOrganics.com or call 888-949-3570.
[02:43:52.157 --> 02:43:52.197]  888-949-3570.
[02:43:57.380 --> 02:44:01.581]  It is a big idea.
[02:44:01.601 --> 02:44:03.722]  A New World Order.
[02:44:04.422 --> 02:44:08.863]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:44:09.323 --> 02:44:12.124]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:44:12.164 --> 02:44:14.325]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:44:14.945 --> 02:44:17.406]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:44:18.126 --> 02:44:25.468]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:44:26.974 --> 02:44:27.118]  Yeah.
[02:44:28.464 --> 02:44:33.427]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:44:33.908 --> 02:44:37.390]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:44:37.770 --> 02:44:40.252]  Bill of Rights is making great progress for the world government.
[02:44:40.352 --> 02:44:41.493]  Most people have no idea.
[02:44:41.513 --> 02:44:42.273]  They're not after money.
[02:44:42.293 --> 02:44:43.374]  They have all the money they need.
[02:44:43.574 --> 02:44:44.315]  They're after power.
[02:44:44.555 --> 02:44:45.395]  That's what I have to teach you.
[02:44:45.696 --> 02:44:53.961]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:44:57.223 --> 02:44:58.284]  You have been warned.
[02:44:59.325 --> 02:45:00.065]  We're good to go.
[02:45:20.220 --> 02:45:29.231]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[02:45:29.910 --> 02:45:30.911]  Garden in a Can.
[02:45:31.311 --> 02:45:32.172]  It's that simple.
[02:45:32.532 --> 02:45:34.393]  Fresh, healthy, easy.
[02:45:34.914 --> 02:45:38.876]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[02:45:39.257 --> 02:45:40.177]  Ready when you are.

[02:46:03.263 --> 02:46:20.362]  Folks, it makes me so sick that all these anti-American pieces of filth are destroying our country, gutting it for foreign banks, always wrap themselves in the American flag.
[02:46:20.382 --> 02:46:22.584]  Do you want to turn us into a police state like Baghdad?
[02:46:23.786 --> 02:46:28.028]  They had all these spook factories and illegal CIA, NSA operations all around us.
[02:46:28.748 --> 02:46:32.750]  And then a newspaper comes down to take photos of it and they run out and get in their face.
[02:46:33.790 --> 02:46:36.011]  And they use the local police to engage in their crime.
[02:46:38.012 --> 02:46:38.892]  Don't you understand?
[02:46:38.932 --> 02:46:40.513]  You guys have ruined America!
[02:46:44.195 --> 02:46:46.395]  Your boss has carried out the Al-Qaeda attacks.
[02:46:46.415 --> 02:46:47.136]  I don't want to hear it.
[02:46:47.156 --> 02:46:52.196]  You're taking all our rights because of Al-Qaeda, as you say that there's secretly white Al-Qaeda everywhere.
[02:46:52.557 --> 02:46:54.537]  I mean, what a load of bull.
[02:46:56.317 --> 02:47:00.918]  Meanwhile, real Al-Qaeda works for your filthy operation, and you know it, attacking people worldwide.
[02:47:00.938 --> 02:47:10.320]  I just don't want to be a slave.
[02:47:12.179 --> 02:47:15.420]  I don't even like having to buck up against these tyrants, but I'm just sick of it.
[02:47:17.761 --> 02:47:18.682]  So sick of it.
[02:47:18.762 --> 02:47:20.283]  So sick of all their crimes.
[02:47:20.583 --> 02:47:27.766]  You put illegal spook bases in, and then you don't want the citizen slaves taking photos of it, and outside the law you're trying to intimidate us?
[02:47:28.766 --> 02:47:33.728]  That's one step away from death camps, and you've built the camps, then you deny those when you know all about them.
[02:47:33.988 --> 02:47:35.389]  You're a pack of criminals!
[02:47:36.309 --> 02:47:39.731]  And most of you idiots serving it are going to have your whole future destroyed by it.
[02:47:41.502 --> 02:47:42.142]  Now, you know what?
[02:47:42.222 --> 02:47:44.103]  I got the Pope calling for world government.
[02:47:44.183 --> 02:47:44.603]  I mean, you know.
[02:47:45.543 --> 02:47:49.705]  And saying we need to have a loving world government regulating the globalism.
[02:47:50.805 --> 02:47:52.566]  When it's the globalists that engineered all of this.
[02:47:53.626 --> 02:47:57.147]  So the globalists blame themselves for their operations and then say, oh, give us more power.
[02:47:57.607 --> 02:48:01.709]  And then I've got Al Gore saying we need a global carbon tax and that America just passed part of it.
[02:48:02.329 --> 02:48:05.070]  And that we need global governance, which means global government.
[02:48:05.290 --> 02:48:09.371]  And says to all the government officials in the room, I'm counting on you for world government.
[02:48:09.612 --> 02:48:10.792]  Go ahead and start playing the clip.
[02:48:12.915 --> 02:48:14.356]  The Al Gore clip from yesterday.
[02:48:14.396 --> 02:48:17.577]  It's up on InfoWars.com if you want to see it.
[02:48:18.317 --> 02:48:26.561]  Within one month of taking office, President Obama secured $80 billion U.S.
[02:48:26.701 --> 02:48:31.323]  for renewable energy and green infrastructure.
[02:48:32.324 --> 02:48:40.648]  And then just two weeks ago, the House of Representatives passed the Waxman-Markey bill, which
[02:48:41.388 --> 02:48:50.101]  For all of its flaws does put a price on carbon and is very much a step in the right direction.
[02:48:50.362 --> 02:48:52.625]  It achieves real reductions below the 1990
[02:48:55.239 --> 02:48:57.319]  Base level by 2020.
[02:48:58.660 --> 02:49:13.503]  And that is the threshold that many have said, including many in China, is the threshold that will dramatically increase the prospects for success.
[02:49:15.843 --> 02:49:18.044]  But it is the awareness itself
[02:49:19.417 --> 02:49:21.318]  That will drive the change.
[02:49:21.478 --> 02:49:24.398]  And one of the ways it will drive the change is through... Here it comes.
[02:49:24.839 --> 02:49:26.379]  ...global governance and global agreements.
[02:49:26.419 --> 02:49:26.719]  Pack it up.
[02:49:26.739 --> 02:49:27.079]  Pack it up.
[02:49:27.139 --> 02:49:27.840]  I want to hear it again.
[02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:29.400]  Look at this bastard.
[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:33.841]  You will pay taxes directly to him, and he admits it in Congress.
[02:49:36.042 --> 02:49:36.522]  I mean, what?
[02:49:36.782 --> 02:49:37.922]  We will put up with anything.
[02:49:37.983 --> 02:49:38.503]  Why not?
[02:49:38.663 --> 02:49:40.783]  We'll put up people bossing us around America.
[02:49:41.243 --> 02:49:44.144]  Hey, don't photograph our criminal base where we read your email, punk.
[02:49:44.845 --> 02:49:46.045]  You might be a terrorist.
[02:49:47.128 --> 02:49:48.789]  You're the terrorist and we all know it!
[02:49:49.090 --> 02:49:50.351]  You sicko freaks!
[02:49:52.492 --> 02:49:53.794]  Play that bastard again.
[02:49:53.814 --> 02:50:02.301]  That will drive the change and one of the ways it will drive the change is through global governance and global agreements.
[02:50:03.001 --> 02:50:04.482]  Oh, global governance.
[02:50:04.522 --> 02:50:06.344]  Global governance means global government.
[02:50:07.465 --> 02:50:09.507]  And the Pope calls for world government.
[02:50:09.567 --> 02:50:10.407]  Global governance.
[02:50:10.447 --> 02:50:11.969]  I've got that Reuters
[02:50:13.692 --> 02:50:15.393]  Everything else, I meant to get to that today.
[02:50:15.773 --> 02:50:16.873]  I'm gonna cover that tomorrow.
[02:50:18.994 --> 02:50:21.035]  I mean, this is just getting too insane.
[02:50:21.295 --> 02:50:24.276]  Environmental Protection Agency sets up Green Police.
[02:50:25.677 --> 02:50:31.079]  I mean, NSA, another 1.8 billion data center in another state, in Utah.
[02:50:31.959 --> 02:50:33.600]  There's total corruption everywhere.
[02:50:33.620 --> 02:50:35.481]  I'm just sick of you, Phil!
[02:50:35.501 --> 02:50:36.561]  You've stolen everything!
[02:50:36.721 --> 02:50:37.722]  You've destroyed America!
[02:50:37.762 --> 02:50:38.382]  Great job!
[02:50:38.602 --> 02:50:39.582]  Retransmit this to our staff.
[02:50:41.283 --> 02:50:42.984]  You are listening to GCA.

[02:50:50.441 --> 02:50:51.402]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:50:51.522 --> 02:50:56.164]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:50:56.244 --> 02:50:59.006]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:50:59.206 --> 02:51:02.088]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:51:02.248 --> 02:51:08.111]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:51:08.331 --> 02:51:11.273]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:51:11.573 --> 02:51:18.478]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:51:18.558 --> 02:51:21.680]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
