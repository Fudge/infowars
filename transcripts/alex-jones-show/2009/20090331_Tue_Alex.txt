[00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:08.707]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.387 --> 00:00:10.187]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.947 --> 00:00:11.868]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.528 --> 00:00:16.169]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.791]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.972 --> 00:00:24.913]  Alright, for the next 20 minutes, then I'm opening the phones up.
[00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:26.946]  The number's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:27.086]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:32.914]  We're open to phones up on any of the issues you've been covering, anything you'd like to discuss.
[00:00:32.955 --> 00:00:35.258]  But for the next 20 minutes, we're joined by Steve Watson of, uh...
[00:00:41.727 --> 00:00:44.451]  PrisonPlanet.com works for us over in London.
[00:00:44.951 --> 00:00:48.215]  Anarchist plot mayhem for the G20 in London.
[00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:58.028]  Kurt Nemo, London Independent reports extremists and anarchist groups are handing out literature ahead of London's G20 summit instructing demonstrators on how best to confront and attack the police.
[00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:12.896]  From Denver, Colorado, last year at the DNC, to Ottawa, Canada, at the SPP meeting early last year, they've been caught, the police dressed up like anarchists, leading groups of hired foundation thugs, paid for by the big banks, to attack police.
[00:01:13.317 --> 00:01:20.360]  To then show that on the news, so the police have a pretext to say, oh look, we're being restrained for a day or so, then to attack the peaceful crowds.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.324]  This is the way they demonize the demonstrators, and that covers up all the news attention of what the G20 is actually setting up.
[00:01:28.144 --> 00:01:29.685]  Obama's about to arrive in England.
[00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:33.228]  He's going to have an audience with the Queen and literally curtsy to her.
[00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:35.270]  That's in the London Telegraph.
[00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.615]  We've got him then traveling to Europe proper for the G20 meeting that Gordon Brown founded and runs, openly setting up world government.
[00:01:42.075 --> 00:01:51.062]  And then we have the London Guardian reporting the government's going to turn off the CCT cameras, claiming there's a law that they're not high enough resolution, so they're just going to turn them all off.
[00:01:51.862 --> 00:01:57.064]  So they can carry out their mischief, just like they turned them off right before they carried out the 7-7 bombing.
[00:01:57.464 --> 00:01:59.365]  Steve Watson joining us from London.
[00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:00.225]  Tell us what's going on.
[00:02:01.426 --> 00:02:02.166]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:02.906]  Good, sir.
[00:02:04.027 --> 00:02:17.491]  Yeah, okay, I think the first thing we should discuss really is concerning the media hype surrounding the supposed foiled terrorist plot in relation to the protests.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:32.590]  The Guardian reported that yesterday three men and two women aged between 16 and 25 living in the south of England were arrested.
[00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:48.122]  They raided the house and they brought in the Royal Navy Bomb Disposal Squad and it was hyped up in the media as a sort of terrorist plot relating to the G20 protests.
[00:02:48.242 --> 00:02:49.263]  It comes out today that
[00:02:50.686 --> 00:02:59.730]  What they found was, um, quote, allegedly extremist materials, but they didn't expand on what they might be.
[00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.012]  Um, yesterday they said they found explosive devices.
[00:03:04.092 --> 00:03:07.114]  It turns out now that these are fireworks.
[00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.510]  Now let me stop you.
[00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:23.453]  Mainstream government reports in the news say that a cell phone is terrorist material, that a van is terrorist material, and that soap bottles in the trash can call the anti-terror police.
[00:03:23.513 --> 00:03:25.233]  So this is all part of the hype.
[00:03:25.273 --> 00:03:26.733]  My God, they had fireworks.
[00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:27.653]  They are Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:29.094 --> 00:03:29.794]  Well, that's right.
[00:03:29.814 --> 00:03:36.615]  We've recently seen all those anti-terrorist posters that have gone up all over London.
[00:03:37.472 --> 00:03:46.820]  Saying that you should lock in each other's, lock in your neighbor's trash to see, you know, what's going on there, if they've got any chemical bottles, etc.
[00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:54.666]  Um, well, this dovetails with that, really, because it was hyped up, but it turns out these are just fireworks.
[00:03:54.746 --> 00:04:00.591]  They had plastic, um, replica guns, handguns.
[00:04:00.811 --> 00:04:01.692]  Oh my gosh!
[00:04:02.192 --> 00:04:03.273]  They had toy guns!
[00:04:03.553 --> 00:04:04.214]  Oh, please.
[00:04:04.694 --> 00:04:06.336]  This whole thing started off when
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.722]  Um, the police were tipped off by one of these men who was spraying graffiti on a wall.
[00:04:13.742 --> 00:04:31.108]  Um, and it turns out that what he, what he was spraying was the word, uh, Antifa, which is, it's basically a group that advocates, um, fighting with extreme right-wingers at protests.
[00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:32.368]  So this is all
[00:04:33.032 --> 00:04:58.705]  This is all being whipped into a frenzy and hyped up by the media, so... Yeah, you better have troops marching around in black uniforms, helicopters, face-scanning cameras, because they're zit-faced teenagers, spray-painting, oh no, give up all your rights, they have toy guns, it's all over, only the state will save us, stay there, Steve Watson, Paul Watson coming up, oh, oh, I'm scared, give up all, give up all my rights, please, save me!
[00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.311]  Attention gardeners!
[00:05:01.371 --> 00:05:03.733]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[00:05:03.973 --> 00:05:08.297]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[00:05:08.497 --> 00:05:16.384]  It's called Proto-Grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:05:16.704 --> 00:05:19.527]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:05:19.807 --> 00:05:27.350]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:33.033]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:05:33.273 --> 00:05:38.815]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:05:39.096 --> 00:05:42.337]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:05:42.637 --> 00:05:45.999]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:51.282]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Chief superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:05:51.302 --> 00:05:54.164]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:05:54.224 --> 00:05:54.464]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:05:54.524 --> 00:05:57.446]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:12.307]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:12.848 --> 00:06:19.029]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:21.150]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.690]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:34.613]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:36.957 --> 00:06:38.218]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:40.020]  It's about a one world government.
[00:06:40.481 --> 00:06:46.808]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:06:57.239 --> 00:06:58.440]  The people strike back.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.081]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:13.643]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[00:07:13.923 --> 00:07:17.204]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[00:07:17.484 --> 00:07:20.424]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[00:07:20.724 --> 00:07:22.845]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?

[00:08:01.505 --> 00:08:07.507]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.127 --> 00:08:11.168]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.888 --> 00:08:18.770]  I know we're covering the G20 and the open announcement for world government, but I just can't get over the last hour's interview with our reporters on the ground.
[00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:45.391]  In Central California, in Southern California, at the tent cities, where they're kidnapping their children, taking their Winnebago's, saying, do you have insurance for this, and taking them, but not doing that to illegal aliens, and forcing them into this FEMA camp, and then I've got the LA Times saying the same thing at another camp, in Ontario, California, right outside LA, with the same thing, taking their Winnebago's, taking their RVs, taking their children, taking their dogs,
[00:08:46.132 --> 00:08:47.455]  My God, this is hellish!
[00:08:47.615 --> 00:08:49.579]  I mean, this just is so evil!
[00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:55.691]  This is the predatory, dirtbag, corrupt, stinking state that hates the American people!
[00:08:57.435 --> 00:08:59.676]  I want to bring Paul Watson up here in a moment, and Steve Watson.
[00:08:59.696 --> 00:09:04.238]  Steve Watson, so they've got, as usual, they always have some fake terror plot.
[00:09:04.818 --> 00:09:13.001]  You know, like they said, in Miami, a group of black Muslims are planning to wage war, destroy every capital, an army of death with incredible weapons.
[00:09:13.061 --> 00:09:15.001]  And two days later, they were homeless kids.
[00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:15.682]  The FBI gave $100,000.
[00:09:16.042 --> 00:09:17.822]  They were black Christians.
[00:09:18.743 --> 00:09:26.866]  They told them, the homeless kids, to go videotape teenagers, some as young as 14, that they'd give them $100,000 if they would videotape the FBI building.
[00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:30.009]  And they said, okay, went and videotaped it and then hyped the news.
[00:09:30.409 --> 00:09:34.531]  It's the same story over and over again, but the news, when it's the big headline, terrorists!
[00:09:34.551 --> 00:09:38.452]  They just plotted a, you know, foiled an attack with dirty bombs, my gosh!
[00:09:38.472 --> 00:09:41.373]  It turns out, fireworks at their house and a toy cap gun.
[00:09:42.473 --> 00:09:43.914]  And I've seen this to Patriot groups.
[00:09:43.934 --> 00:09:48.836]  They'll raid some militia guy, they'll walk out on the news and go, look, pipe bombs and hold up jumper cables.
[00:09:48.876 --> 00:09:49.856]  I mean, they don't care!
[00:09:51.877 --> 00:09:54.498]  I mean, this government is completely criminal.
[00:09:55.993 --> 00:09:56.974]  It's illegitimate.
[00:09:57.554 --> 00:10:05.720]  Steve Watson, we've got all these headlines, but I'm turning off the CCTV cameras so people can't see the cops dressed up like anarchists attacking people.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.562]  The Foundation-funded anarchists always send us threatening emails saying we're lying about this.
[00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:12.524]  When it's all over the news, they work for the cops and have been caught everywhere.
[00:10:12.544 --> 00:10:15.106]  I made a film ten years ago about it.
[00:10:16.127 --> 00:10:18.028]  We've got all of this going on.
[00:10:18.068 --> 00:10:18.488]  We've got
[00:10:19.489 --> 00:10:22.972]  Okay, so we've got this group of kids with fake guns and fireworks.
[00:10:23.012 --> 00:10:23.832]  This has been hyped up.
[00:10:23.852 --> 00:10:26.914]  And now, as a result of this and the week-long, you know, campaign, seemingly, by the police to
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.702]  Ensure everyone that it's going to turn violent, because that's what they've been saying.
[00:10:51.203 --> 00:10:56.986]  We've got Gordon Brown coming out today saying that it's going to be violent, but we're going to deal with it swiftly.
[00:10:57.607 --> 00:11:06.212]  We've got 500... Sorry, 5,000 extra police on the streets, under something called Operation Glencoe.
[00:11:06.713 --> 00:11:09.614]  They've armed them all with tasers.
[00:11:10.615 --> 00:11:15.258]  We've got banks boarded up, shops boarded up, bankers being told not to
[00:11:16.127 --> 00:11:22.689]  Dress like bankers because they'll be attacked and strung up and skinned alive and all this kind of thing.
[00:11:22.889 --> 00:11:35.653]  And then meanwhile, the big foundation run Soviet groups, the communist groups having their own conference, they're allowed to openly call for violence and put out websites and pamphlets and nothing's done to them because they're stinking operatives.
[00:11:35.693 --> 00:11:36.113]  Go ahead.
[00:11:37.294 --> 00:11:37.774]  Well, that's right.
[00:11:37.794 --> 00:11:43.776]  We've got a load of stories out today, um, about the, the anarchist, you know,
[00:11:45.049 --> 00:11:47.510]  They're openly telling the press what they're going to do.
[00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:53.133]  They've been handing out flyers and maps and everything of where they're going to go.
[00:11:53.153 --> 00:11:58.115]  They say they're going to pretend to be legitimate protesters.
[00:11:58.135 --> 00:12:10.180]  Then they're going to break off from the group Storm the City, which is a financial district of London, and quote, hold it down for as long as they possibly can.
[00:12:11.403 --> 00:12:12.765]  So let's understand what's happening.
[00:12:12.785 --> 00:12:22.155]  We need to do a blurb off the hundreds of admissions mainstream, you know, Canadian press, US press, French press, Dutch press, where they hire these thugs.
[00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:30.584]  I've got training videos of where they're taken by the foundations and trained in Oregon three months before they then fly them into Seattle in 99s when I learned about all of this.
[00:12:30.985 --> 00:12:32.426]  Now the police on tape admitting it.
[00:12:32.967 --> 00:12:35.988]  Yeah, I mean the last major protest we had in London on this scale was when Bush came over
[00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:21.491]  Last summer, on his farewell tour, and people came out there, and there was a lot of stories then about provocateuring the MP, the anti-war MP, George Galloway, officially accused a police officer of provocateuring him.
[00:13:21.571 --> 00:13:29.196]  No, no, no, exactly, no, it was in mainstream British papers and on YouTube, because folks shot video of
[00:13:30.424 --> 00:13:39.286]  And it came out because some gay guy recognized the gay police officer, his lover, dressed up, that was one of the stories, you can pull it, I forget the name, it was like London Times or something.
[00:13:40.366 --> 00:13:52.128]  He recognized him, dressed up like an anarchist, hitting cops and yelling and calling for fights, and then his gay lover went on the news and said, that's my lover, I recognize him, and then it all came out.
[00:13:52.268 --> 00:13:53.788]  So, go ahead.
[00:13:53.808 --> 00:13:57.229]  You know, there's a whole history of it, you can go to
[00:13:58.363 --> 00:14:09.770]  Uh, Seattle, the World Trade Organization protest in 99, which was in your film Police State 2, um, you know, it's all covered in there.
[00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:22.718]  There's the SPP protest two years, three years ago, two years ago in Montebello, Canada, where we've been over that, where the hired provocateurs were outed as they had to admit that they were
[00:14:23.544 --> 00:14:25.765]  They were police.
[00:14:25.825 --> 00:14:28.886]  Royal Mounted Police, go ahead.
[00:14:29.946 --> 00:14:31.067]  You know, Genoa.
[00:14:32.227 --> 00:14:35.048]  WTO protest in Genoa in 2001.
[00:14:35.789 --> 00:14:52.075]  You got protesters being shot and run over and the Italian police taking over schools and putting people in there and then later admitting that they were claiming to be protesters, anarchists.
[00:14:53.797 --> 00:14:56.699]  Well, they just caught them in Greece a few months ago.
[00:14:57.119 --> 00:15:01.342]  The police directing guys with sledgehammers and baseball bats beating up cars.
[00:15:01.522 --> 00:15:02.242]  And they were cops.
[00:15:02.262 --> 00:15:06.644]  That's on national news in Greece that the cops are doing it.
[00:15:08.105 --> 00:15:11.327]  There was a free trade area of America's protest in 2003 or 2004.
[00:15:13.088 --> 00:15:15.489]  There was a Fortune 599 in Austin with Austin cops I caught doing it.
[00:15:21.363 --> 00:15:23.905]  Yeah, so I mean, there's a long history of it.
[00:15:24.265 --> 00:15:38.116]  So, you know, we've got the police, you know, got bomb squads being detached to houses with kids with fireworks in while these anarchists are all sort of making their plans known in public.
[00:15:38.176 --> 00:15:48.244]  And another thing that's come out of this is demonisation of the internet, because in the media they've been, you know, harping on about how
[00:15:49.091 --> 00:15:59.598]  All these dangerous, sort of, protesters that want violence have been using Twitter and using Facebook and that's how they're gonna, you know, evade the police.
[00:16:00.058 --> 00:16:04.080]  That's right, the terrorists, the terrorist extremists are using the internet.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.622]  It must be restricted immediately!
[00:16:07.322 --> 00:16:13.026]  Exactly, and this comes at the same time we've got all these debates going on about the government wanting to monitor
[00:16:13.757 --> 00:16:16.098]  Social networks like Facebook and Twitter.
[00:16:16.578 --> 00:16:22.639]  And we have the head of anti-terrorism, Cybersecurity Resign, saying the Pentagon's running the whole thing illegally.
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:38.603]  Yeah, we've got... I mean, they've already virtually got the right to monitor emails and phone calls of everybody in this country if it's deemed to be a security threat, and now they want to do the same for these social networks.
[00:16:38.663 --> 00:16:41.564]  So, if anything kicks off in the next few days,
[00:16:42.782 --> 00:16:46.643]  That's already been hyped to a point where it's going to provide them a perfect pretext.
[00:16:47.663 --> 00:16:51.964]  Steve, can I get you with your cell phone to go down and do some reporting for us perhaps Thursday and Friday?
[00:16:53.625 --> 00:16:55.525]  Well, I can, yeah.
[00:16:56.745 --> 00:17:02.947]  I mean, it's going to be, I think it's going to be intense down there.
[00:17:03.874 --> 00:17:17.906]  Now I want to go from Steve to Paul Watson, his brother also works with us, but specifically, what do you think of the London Telegraph and other articles about how all last week Obama is practicing gifts and etiquette, how to be reviewed by the Queen and to bow to her?
[00:17:21.389 --> 00:17:22.570]  What do I think about that?
[00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:23.191]  Yes.
[00:17:24.692 --> 00:17:29.296]  Well, I haven't seen any of that, but what was in the Telegraph?
[00:17:30.497 --> 00:17:31.578]  The Telegraph, yeah.
[00:17:32.372 --> 00:17:35.053]  That's the kind of thing that they'd print.
[00:17:35.654 --> 00:17:45.298]  Of course, you know, we saw when Bush came to meet the Queen, who is of course distantly related to it, it's all the same bloodlines.
[00:17:46.099 --> 00:17:53.002]  We saw the open sort of pomp and ceremony there, I'm sure it'll be along the same lines as that.
[00:17:53.891 --> 00:17:54.892]  Yeah, here's the article.
[00:17:55.212 --> 00:17:59.154]  Barack Obama's team preparing adequate gifts for President's meeting with the Queen.
[00:17:59.574 --> 00:18:07.858]  Top advisors to Obama are rehearsingly adequate in debating what gifts President will give to Queen Elizabeth when he meets the British monarch in London.
[00:18:08.499 --> 00:18:10.800]  The gifts have been selected with extra care.
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.962]  Protocol lessons on royal etiquette are being delivered.
[00:18:16.078 --> 00:18:24.063]  And a week's wardrobe of casual and formal attire set aside for the first lady who was an international style icon.
[00:18:24.523 --> 00:18:43.336]  President Obama and his wife Michelle head to London on Tuesday to start their first overseas tour in office, accompanied by an entourage of several hundred aides, advisors, secret service agents and bodyguards, and an imported cavalcade of armoured vehicles and helicopters.
[00:18:44.036 --> 00:18:44.936]  Sounds glorious, doesn't it?
[00:19:07.073 --> 00:19:10.055]  You know, we all have fun doing voices.
[00:19:10.336 --> 00:19:11.917]  Hey, Steve, you want to do your Texas voice?
[00:19:11.937 --> 00:19:13.098]  You do that pretty good.
[00:19:13.418 --> 00:19:14.959]  Get on my land, boys!
[00:19:15.059 --> 00:19:15.740]  My land!
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.181]  Go ahead and do one for us.
[00:19:18.602 --> 00:19:19.543]  I can't do that now.
[00:19:20.063 --> 00:19:20.964]  Yes, you can do it!
[00:19:20.984 --> 00:19:21.404]  Do it now!
[00:19:21.424 --> 00:19:24.126]  You have to wear the cowboy hat to do it.
[00:19:24.306 --> 00:19:26.308]  It's like an Elmer Fudd cartoon.
[00:19:26.348 --> 00:19:29.270]  I don't have the character to do that.
[00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:30.931]  Imagine a cowboy hat's now on your head.
[00:19:31.292 --> 00:19:31.832]  Take us out.
[00:19:31.852 --> 00:19:32.513]  You're on the spot.
[00:19:32.793 --> 00:19:34.454]  The curtain parts, the spotlight's on.
[00:19:34.474 --> 00:19:35.075]  Steve Watson!
[00:19:36.249 --> 00:19:38.110]  Get off my land, boy!
[00:19:41.851 --> 00:19:42.831]  Gotta have some fun.
[00:19:42.871 --> 00:19:43.591]  We love you, Steve.
[00:19:44.011 --> 00:19:45.151]  Steve, thanks for spending time with us.
[00:19:45.171 --> 00:19:47.592]  We're gonna come back to your brother, Paul Watson, okay?
[00:19:48.292 --> 00:19:49.272]  Okay, thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:19:49.553 --> 00:19:52.613]  Check out his great writing over at Infowars.net.
[00:19:52.633 --> 00:19:53.093]  That's the site.
[00:19:53.133 --> 00:19:54.314]  He completely honchos himself.
[00:19:54.714 --> 00:19:57.635]  Also does work over at PrisonBlinded.com.
[00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:58.935]  Get off my land, boy!
[00:20:00.649 --> 00:20:06.492]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[00:20:06.832 --> 00:20:12.835]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:20:13.256 --> 00:20:18.538]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:20:18.999 --> 00:20:21.080]  Starve or surrender.
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:25.282]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:20:25.742 --> 00:20:26.643]  What then?
[00:20:29.366 --> 00:20:32.187]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:20:32.427 --> 00:20:36.608]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[00:20:36.769 --> 00:20:39.589]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.
[00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:46.672]  You can now have an infinite amount of healthy vegetables like a watermelon, a bundle of carrots, or tomatoes for a little more than a penny each.
[00:20:46.852 --> 00:20:48.633]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:20:48.753 --> 00:20:54.134]  And now you can go into business with Big John at SurvivalistSeeds.com by becoming an affiliate.
[00:20:54.174 --> 00:20:56.795]  See his link at SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:20:56.895 --> 00:20:57.696]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:21:00.245 --> 00:21:05.552]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:06.073 --> 00:21:13.082]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:19.813]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:20.213 --> 00:21:22.054]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:22.194 --> 00:21:24.615]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:24.695 --> 00:21:35.620]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:21:36.281 --> 00:21:37.561]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:37.941 --> 00:21:39.302]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:21:39.804 --> 00:21:46.126]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:21:46.706 --> 00:21:54.488]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:54.968 --> 00:21:56.109]  The Obama Deception.
[00:21:56.529 --> 00:21:57.809]  The people strike back.
[00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.670]  Peter Cranshamble here from Midas Resources.
[00:22:02.971 --> 00:22:05.411]  Are you concerned about uncontrollable government spending?
[00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:07.832]  A banking system on the verge of collapse?
[00:22:08.462 --> 00:22:10.344]  Banks on the edge of being nationalized?
[00:22:10.884 --> 00:22:12.766]  Wall Street in continuous free fall?
[00:22:13.366 --> 00:22:15.688]  Scandal after scandal with hedge funds companies?
[00:22:16.229 --> 00:22:21.113]  If protecting your hard-earned savings or retirement fund is on your mind, the answer is simple.
[00:22:21.633 --> 00:22:24.155]  Secure your assets by purchasing gold and silver.
[00:22:24.696 --> 00:22:32.903]  Since President Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1971, the United States has been operating the longest-running fiat currency in the history of mankind.
[00:22:33.604 --> 00:22:36.686]  Gold has held its purchasing power for over 6,000 years.
[00:22:37.186 --> 00:22:39.388]  Contact me, Peter Kronshnabel, at 1-800-686-2237 ext.
[00:22:39.408 --> 00:22:39.388]  108.
[00:22:39.628 --> 00:22:41.209]  Once again, that's Peter at 1-800-686-2237 ext.
[00:22:41.229 --> 00:22:41.209]  108.
[00:22:41.449 --> 00:22:42.850]  While you can still purchase gold with paper.
[00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:43.531]  That is 1-800-686-2237 ext. 108.
[00:22:59.716 --> 00:23:07.802]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:23:07.962 --> 00:23:12.365]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:23:12.525 --> 00:23:17.028]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:23:17.188 --> 00:23:18.589]  It's a documented fact.
[00:23:19.469 --> 00:23:26.072]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:23:26.233 --> 00:23:38.078]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.
[00:23:38.318 --> 00:23:42.000]  FPP is now available to you from FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.441]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[00:23:45.741 --> 00:23:49.403]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.
[00:23:49.463 --> 00:23:52.944]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[00:23:52.964 --> 00:23:53.205]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:23:53.225 --> 00:23:54.825]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:23:54.845 --> 00:23:56.426]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:27.091 --> 00:24:30.434]  Jason Burmiss just ran up to me during the break and he's like, I've got it on video!
[00:24:31.515 --> 00:24:37.600]  Dick Morris and Sean Hannity last night admitted the New World Order conspiracy and the world currency and that all the conspiracy nuts are right.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.142]  See, I'm hearing that everywhere.
[00:24:40.236 --> 00:24:41.616]  Hello Alex, good to be back.
[00:24:41.636 --> 00:24:45.198]  Well, what springs to mind when I read about all these black bloc anarchist groups
[00:25:10.714 --> 00:25:15.675]  Threatening riots and threatening to attack police and buildings and stuff.
[00:25:16.535 --> 00:25:24.877]  And this is targeted specifically at the Black Block Anarchists, which we know are provocateurs, not the legitimate protesters, of which I'm sure there'll be many.
[00:25:25.758 --> 00:25:31.579]  But, you know, the question is, why are they so angry about the economic crisis?
[00:25:31.979 --> 00:25:35.440]  Most of the Black Block Anarchists, the Communists and Marxists,
[00:25:36.596 --> 00:25:40.898]  And we read that they're supposedly protesting against, quote, capitalism.
[00:25:41.859 --> 00:25:55.686]  Well, if that's the case, you know, they should be happy about how the elite have responded to the economic crisis, because everything they've done in response to it has eviscerated any notion of free market capitalism.
[00:25:55.706 --> 00:26:03.190]  You know, you've got Obama effectively firing a CEO of a private company on Sunday afternoon.
[00:26:04.375 --> 00:26:07.056]  How does that represent the interest of capitalism?
[00:26:08.357 --> 00:26:31.848]  And these people are supposedly protesting against Gordon Brown, as if Gordon Brown represents free market capitalism when he comes from a school of political thinking born out of the Labour Party, which is completely entrenched in Marxism and Stalinism, which is what a lot of what these black bloc protesters would themselves embrace.
[00:26:32.679 --> 00:26:43.264]  That's why it doesn't fit right with me, that these individuals are supposedly representative of the anger that's arisen out of the economic crisis.
[00:26:43.965 --> 00:26:57.131]  Because you have to ask yourself, how many of the Black Bloc anarchists, and again I'm talking about these Black Bloc, not the legitimate protesters, how many of them have actually been affected by the economic crisis?
[00:26:57.832 --> 00:27:00.993]  Do the majority of them have jobs and pay taxes?
[00:27:01.594 --> 00:27:02.334]  The answer's no.
[00:27:02.847 --> 00:27:06.430]  Do the majority of them own property that's losing its value every day?
[00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:06.870]  No.
[00:27:08.451 --> 00:27:17.538]  Do the majority of them have savings accounts that are losing value every day as a result of their... Well, the globalists openly finance these groups.
[00:27:17.558 --> 00:27:18.979]  We've caught them over and over again.
[00:27:19.019 --> 00:27:20.520]  They're a disgusting lot of people.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:26.944]  You've got some stupid camp followers of the Anarchists who aren't government agents, but they're government foundation operatives at the top.
[00:27:27.225 --> 00:27:28.465]  We've caught them over and over again.
[00:27:28.505 --> 00:27:29.046]  It's a fact.
[00:27:29.326 --> 00:27:38.929]  And they don't like hearing it, and they trot them out to demonize real protests, so the police can attack protests, to then create a chilling effect where normal people don't come out in mass to demonstrate.
[00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:40.350]  Right.
[00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:58.376]  And it's all about getting the middle class to support the police state, because in Britain, the middle class, who, ironically, are the prime target of the economic assault, so, you know, they're equally as brain-dead as the Black Bloc anarchists, they don't realize it.
[00:27:58.877 --> 00:28:16.287]  They're the target of the economic assault and yet a majority of them, I would estimate in this country, will cheer the police on as they crack the heads of these anarchists this week because they have distaste for these anarchists because of the things they do.
[00:28:16.347 --> 00:28:18.528]  They have no real solutions.
[00:28:18.628 --> 00:28:24.732]  It's like in your film, Martial Law, you went and interviewed
[00:28:25.276 --> 00:28:35.843]  The anarchists and the communists at the different protests there in New York, and he tried to engage in a conversation with them about what they were actually protesting against.
[00:28:36.824 --> 00:28:48.571]  And in 99% of the people you speak to, the most they're able to give you is, you know, a two sentence cliche about the evils of capitalism and the bourgeoisie middle class.
[00:28:49.672 --> 00:28:54.155]  So it's the middle class that will cheer the police on when they crack their heads that
[00:28:55.151 --> 00:28:56.332]  It certainly raised suspicions with me.
[00:28:56.372 --> 00:28:57.472]  I mean, there are people that say, well, you know,
[00:29:19.355 --> 00:29:21.316]  It's only about 60 cameras.
[00:29:21.416 --> 00:29:26.017]  If you count them all up, everybody at the marches are going to have their own cameras and stuff.
[00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:29.318]  So if they're really trying to hide something, they're not going to do a very good job of it.
[00:29:29.338 --> 00:29:31.498]  But, yeah, it's definitely interesting.
[00:29:33.439 --> 00:29:33.839]  All right.
[00:29:33.859 --> 00:29:35.640]  Anything else important to add, Paul?
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.700]  Yeah, I've got a bit more to add.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:38.660]  Stay there.
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.121]  Then we're going to take calls after you leave us in about five, six minutes.
[00:29:41.141 --> 00:29:41.441]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:41.461 --> 00:29:41.901]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:41.921 --> 00:29:43.602]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:43.642 --> 00:29:44.082]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.535 --> 00:29:53.516]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.436 --> 00:29:57.197]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:06.221]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:30:06.941 --> 00:30:12.263]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:30:12.808 --> 00:30:19.009]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:30:19.289 --> 00:30:21.130]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:23.670]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:30:23.731 --> 00:30:34.633]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:30:36.906 --> 00:30:38.167]  It's not about left or right.
[00:30:38.588 --> 00:30:40.009]  It's about a one world government.
[00:30:40.449 --> 00:30:46.775]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:30:47.376 --> 00:30:55.143]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:30:55.623 --> 00:30:56.764]  The Obama Deception.
[00:30:57.205 --> 00:30:58.386]  The people strike back.
[00:31:00.689 --> 00:31:03.050]  This year millions of people will lose electricity.
[00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:07.431]  Ice storms, earthquakes, flooding or hurricanes could leave you without power for days.
[00:31:07.871 --> 00:31:11.772]  Anyone that's ever been in a blackout knows that the first thing you need is a flashlight.
[00:31:12.192 --> 00:31:14.093]  That's why you need the Paclite.
[00:31:14.373 --> 00:31:18.814]  The Paclite is powered by a 9-volt battery and lasts up to 1,200 hours.
[00:31:19.155 --> 00:31:25.456]  It's so small it fits right in your pocket and glows in the dark, making it easy to find when you need it most.
[00:31:26.057 --> 00:31:27.257]  One Florida customer says,
[00:31:27.725 --> 00:31:35.791]  My Paclite has lasted through 4 hurricanes in 2 years, over 30 days without electricity and I'm still using the same battery.
[00:31:36.332 --> 00:31:40.475]  The Paclite comes with a 25 year warranty and prices start at just $12.99.
[00:31:40.996 --> 00:31:43.878]  It's time for you to be prepared with a Paclite.
[00:31:44.338 --> 00:31:46.220]  Visit us at 9voltlite.com.
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:47.841]  That's 9voltlite.com.
[00:31:47.841 --> 00:31:48.723]  I think so.
[00:31:59.932 --> 00:32:01.733]  Gardeners, you have the seeds.

[00:32:25.941 --> 00:32:27.542]  Manhattan fish, blood meal,
[00:32:27.842 --> 00:32:28.202]  I think so.
[00:32:52.336 --> 00:32:54.837]  Low cost and increases hay yields too.
[00:32:55.118 --> 00:32:59.200]  That's liquidorganicfertilizer.com for sale in Canada too.
[00:33:11.886 --> 00:33:16.449]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving.
[00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:20.291]  I won't even turn my head.
[00:33:22.782 --> 00:33:26.685]  Don't send your kinfolks to give me no talkin'.
[00:33:28.386 --> 00:33:30.607]  I'll be gone, like I said.
[00:33:33.229 --> 00:33:37.971]  You'd say the same old thing that you've been sayin' all along.
[00:33:38.192 --> 00:33:42.394]  Lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut till I'm gone.
[00:33:43.115 --> 00:33:47.417]  Don't give me that old familiar cryin', cussin' moan.
[00:33:50.139 --> 00:34:00.729]  Alright, let's go back to Paul Watson and your phone calls.
[00:34:01.109 --> 00:34:06.314]  Okay, Paul, the other key points you've been analyzing over at PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:08.196 --> 00:34:14.942]  Yeah, we were talking about the Black Block Anarchists and it's interesting if you read what people
[00:34:15.424 --> 00:34:37.403]  Throughout history, who have actually changed history through non-violent civil disobedience, have said about rioting, I found a quote from Martin Luther King, who said, quote, The limitation of riots, moral questions aside, is that they cannot win, and their participants know it.
[00:34:37.904 --> 00:34:43.669]  Hence, rioting is not revolutionary, but reactionary, because it invites defeat.
[00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:49.034]  It involves an emotional catharsis, but it must be followed by a sense of futility.
[00:34:50.175 --> 00:34:55.319]  And that's from somebody who actually changed society through non-violent civil disobedience.
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:06.908]  And as we've stressed on many occasions, the only thing that violent riots are going to achieve is A. To demonize legitimate protesters in the eyes of the general public.
[00:35:07.569 --> 00:35:11.792]  B. To enlist the support of the middle class.
[00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:18.954]  to the police state when they cheer on the police, cracking the heads of the anarchist thugs in response to the violence.
[00:35:20.855 --> 00:35:22.996]  They don't ever crack the heads of the anarchist thugs.
[00:35:23.036 --> 00:35:25.677]  They step back, then they attack the peaceful crowd.
[00:35:26.037 --> 00:35:27.438]  That even happened at the RNC.
[00:35:28.379 --> 00:35:35.222]  Cracking the heads of anyone, basically, if they're told it's the same group of people who are doing the violence, then they'll support it.
[00:35:35.802 --> 00:35:36.663]  At the end of the day, I mean,
[00:35:37.549 --> 00:35:46.316]  Every time a black block anarchist thug smashes another Burger King window or whatever, they're helping the very system that they claim they are fighting.
[00:35:47.096 --> 00:35:48.317]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:35:49.038 --> 00:36:00.126]  They don't achieve anything by smashing up a city for a day, they just achieve... Within a society, let's be clear, within a society that still has some freedom, where you still have a chance to peaceably
[00:36:02.204 --> 00:36:06.565]  Expose the system as corrupt to fix it, then nonviolence is the way to go.
[00:36:06.625 --> 00:36:10.726]  If it goes into like a Nazi situation, rounding people up and all that, then it goes to the next level.
[00:36:11.706 --> 00:36:15.487]  But trying to stop it from going to that next level, we want to be peaceful.
[00:36:16.767 --> 00:36:30.150]  Right, and then whenever you research who's behind the groups that have been violent, it's always cops and authorities in Italy, Canada, even in China where the Tibetans had the riots last year.
[00:36:31.064 --> 00:36:35.749]  They, uh, photographs came out of the police chief running around with machetes.
[00:36:36.149 --> 00:36:44.657]  These photographs were later airbrushed and, you know, the machetes were taken out when it was revealed that the police chiefs were all stirring up the, uh, violent riots.
[00:36:44.797 --> 00:36:53.725]  Well, what also came out, what also came out was squads of police in open air areas with a photo snap, this was confirmed, dressing like monks.
[00:36:54.861 --> 00:37:03.727]  to go out and cause the violence, so we need to do a master article that you're so good at, Paul, where we show all these confirmed examples of the state doing this.
[00:37:03.747 --> 00:37:07.209]  I mean, look at how the feds bombed Oklahoma City to get a police state going.
[00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:21.499]  You know, the people always post on the comment boards on InfoWars and Prison Planet, oh, you're a wimp, you should call for violence, but notice that they're not out committing violence, they want us to do it, but then the feds and globalists are always caught staging violence because it helps them.
[00:37:21.759 --> 00:37:23.320]  See, they're doing it because it helps them.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.681]  We're right that it's not good.
[00:37:25.982 --> 00:37:29.203]  Yeah, and I mean, violence only begets more violence.
[00:37:29.824 --> 00:37:31.464]  I mean, that's what they want.
[00:37:31.705 --> 00:37:43.030]  They want a Tiananmen Square type situation where they get the perceived justification for a complete, brutal crackdown, which is exactly what will happen, God forbid if it does.
[00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:49.314]  But if there's some kind of false flag attempt during this week's G20,
[00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:52.852]  Then that will give them all the justification they need.
[00:37:52.872 --> 00:37:55.254]  They've got shoot-to-kill orders still in effect.
[00:37:56.154 --> 00:38:02.219]  And that will give them whatever justification they need for a crackdown that goes beyond anything we've seen.
[00:38:05.362 --> 00:38:06.963]  Any other research, Paul Watson?
[00:38:08.524 --> 00:38:09.024]  No, that's it.
[00:38:09.044 --> 00:38:15.709]  I'm just... This is coming out of the Black Bloc anarchist groups themselves, and it's coming from the very top.
[00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:17.551]  They're saying it's going to be a summer of rage.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.461]  So it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:38:21.141 --> 00:38:23.683]  I'm worried about it and I don't want to see it happen.
[00:38:23.783 --> 00:38:27.344]  So, hopefully, nothing major happens this week.
[00:38:27.384 --> 00:38:32.507]  But if it does, obviously we'll be all over it like white on rice.
[00:38:34.065 --> 00:38:38.949]  Alright, briefly, PrisonPlanet.TV, we could have launched it last week, but we've been so busy.
[00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:42.933]  The 2.0 version, and we're going to add more and more features and functions to it.
[00:38:43.473 --> 00:38:46.556]  This is just Phase 1 we're launching this week, then Phase 2, Phase 3.
[00:38:47.156 --> 00:38:52.261]  Everything PrisonPlanet.TV members get, which then finances so much of what we do here, so it's a win-win.
[00:38:52.741 --> 00:38:56.644]  Paul, tell folks some of the features of the current PrisonPlanet.TV and what's coming.
[00:38:58.726 --> 00:38:59.667]  Well, with the new one,
[00:39:00.526 --> 00:39:09.331]  We've listened to what people wanted to change and what to add to it, and Andre and the crew have done an absolutely fantastic job.
[00:39:09.371 --> 00:39:10.472]  They're just tweaking it.
[00:39:10.532 --> 00:39:17.056]  It's in the final stages now to be released, probably at some point this week, and it's completely user-friendly.
[00:39:17.616 --> 00:39:22.079]  I mean, it's got searchable archives going back five years since we started it.
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.741]  For example, if you wanted to go and watch
[00:39:26.989 --> 00:39:31.630]  A show that you did where you interviewed, say, Ray McGovern, for example.
[00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:42.853]  You could just click on the page, Alex Jones Live, type in the search box, McGovern, and the video results, the search results will pop up and you can just click and watch the interview right there.
[00:39:43.153 --> 00:39:47.754]  So it's that kind of user-friendly functionality that's being added.
[00:39:48.315 --> 00:39:51.255]  And it's the same with the Alex Jones movies.
[00:39:51.295 --> 00:39:53.356]  You can flip between all the movies
[00:39:53.857 --> 00:39:59.460]  Within an instant and just click the ones you want to watch and it'll start playing immediately with the flash player.
[00:39:59.901 --> 00:40:01.342]  And you've got downloads as well.
[00:40:01.842 --> 00:40:16.591]  And of course, because it's been running since April 2004, there's literally thousands of pieces of media going back to 2004, which can also be searched by month, by year.
[00:40:17.271 --> 00:40:19.453]  So everything's right at your fingertip.
[00:40:19.912 --> 00:40:24.597]  And by the way, we uploaded some of the films five years ago in decent quality, but compared to today it's nothing.
[00:40:24.877 --> 00:40:29.502]  We're going to re-upload some of my older films in the newest, highest quality here in the next few weeks.
[00:40:29.902 --> 00:40:35.428]  We're going to have a MySpace type area that really works well and has a lot of things you can change and do.
[00:40:36.048 --> 00:40:37.390]  A message board just for members.
[00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:45.099]  There's a whole bunch of other functions we're going to be adding and now you get the two hours I simulcast the four-hour show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.663]  We're live right now the three hours Jason Berman Stein to midnight.
[00:40:48.043 --> 00:40:49.726]  Special news reports we're about to launch.
[00:40:50.547 --> 00:40:53.651]  All my films, my book, your book, my books got about a hundred copies.
[00:40:54.231 --> 00:40:54.611]  I think so.
[00:41:15.302 --> 00:41:24.529]  We have it in all these formats, the highest quality Flash, QuickTime, Windows, other systems, DivX copies, burned to disk, that play in DVD players.
[00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:26.090]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:27.291]  It's an armory of resistance.
[00:41:27.351 --> 00:41:29.013]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:41:29.053 --> 00:41:30.434]  If you've had a membership, let it elapse.
[00:41:30.454 --> 00:41:31.895]  Go get a new one, you know.
[00:41:31.955 --> 00:41:32.796]  It also supports us.
[00:41:32.836 --> 00:41:35.578]  Or if you haven't ever tried it out, it takes a minute or two to sign up.
[00:41:35.898 --> 00:41:37.059]  Get a monthly trial membership.
[00:41:37.099 --> 00:41:38.680]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:40.782]  Paul Watson, thanks for all your great work, my friend.
[00:41:41.442 --> 00:41:42.123]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:41:43.271 --> 00:41:44.111]  Good to have you here with us.
[00:41:44.151 --> 00:41:48.852]  Okay, I'm going to take calls until about 15 after, then Bob Schultz of We The People Foundation.
[00:41:48.892 --> 00:41:56.114]  We're going to start covering the private IRS, the collection agency, the scams, with a bunch of guests in the next two weeks leading up to April 15th.
[00:41:56.134 --> 00:41:58.394]  So we're starting that today, coming up in the next hour.
[00:41:58.434 --> 00:41:59.354]  Right now, let's go to calls.
[00:41:59.774 --> 00:42:01.095]  Kim in Alabama.
[00:42:01.175 --> 00:42:02.915]  Kim, thanks for holding your own the year.
[00:42:03.955 --> 00:42:04.455]  Hey Alex.
[00:42:04.995 --> 00:42:05.255]  Hi.
[00:42:06.256 --> 00:42:12.897]  I wanted to go back to Friday's show, I believe it was Friday's show, where you had Dr. Whitaker on, and y'all spoke of cancer treatments.
[00:42:14.375 --> 00:42:32.660]  I wanted to share with everybody there is a doctor in Rome named Julio Simoncini who has, he spoke at the 2008 Cancer Convention in LA and he's treating people with sodium bicarbonate baking soda.
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.741]  Three dollars worth of it and they're healed.
[00:42:36.861 --> 00:42:40.162]  But what bugs me is that not a
[00:42:40.669 --> 00:42:44.211]  Doctor in America has picked up on this and run with it.
[00:42:44.392 --> 00:43:07.928]  Well, let me just add, I mean, there's a lot of doctors that claim this or that, but it is true that pH has been found, that's why people get off the meat, get off the cheese, and they eat tons of fruit, tons of organic stuff, and you know, tons of vegetables and things, and exercise, that that's a big part of it, and mainline medical science is having to admit that more and more and start incorporating that, but yeah, I mean, there's a lot of evidence to show that.
[00:43:08.834 --> 00:43:19.122]  But if people would just go online and just do a search, how to make my body more alkaline, they wouldn't get cancer because cancer cannot grow in an alkaline environment.
[00:43:19.843 --> 00:43:20.804]  We're all acidic.
[00:43:21.404 --> 00:43:24.647]  And that's where it takes hold of us.
[00:43:26.088 --> 00:43:27.049]  That is a big part of it.
[00:43:27.089 --> 00:43:28.190]  That's a big part of it, Kim.
[00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:29.971]  Yeah.
[00:43:30.151 --> 00:43:33.454]  If people will just go, can I give you some websites?
[00:43:33.974 --> 00:43:34.194]  Sure.
[00:43:34.214 --> 00:43:35.455]  All right.
[00:43:35.535 --> 00:43:36.436]  The first one is Know, K-N-O-W.
[00:43:38.254 --> 00:43:39.634]  TheCause.com.
[00:43:40.194 --> 00:43:41.695]  Then you click on Shows.
[00:43:42.295 --> 00:43:43.495]  Then click on Dr. Simoncini.
[00:43:43.595 --> 00:43:45.215]  Alright, thank you so much.
[00:43:45.235 --> 00:43:46.296]  I appreciate your call, Kim.
[00:43:46.556 --> 00:43:50.757]  By the way, before I forget, I just want to show you the great artwork of Jason Burmess.
[00:43:51.197 --> 00:43:52.497]  I didn't know he was such a good artist.
[00:43:52.537 --> 00:43:56.598]  This is much better than my doodles.
[00:43:57.738 --> 00:43:58.158]  Look at that.
[00:43:59.799 --> 00:44:03.519]  And he's got a horrible inside joke written beside it, so I'm covering that up.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.340]  But that's some pretty good work there, Burmy.
[00:44:07.483 --> 00:44:08.824]  That's a Jason Barbas original.
[00:44:09.985 --> 00:44:11.826]  Bunch of Alex Jones originals around here, too.
[00:44:13.167 --> 00:44:14.087]  Oh my gosh.
[00:44:14.587 --> 00:44:16.409]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[00:44:16.469 --> 00:44:19.250]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in the United Kingdom.
[00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:19.991]  Matt, you're on the air.
[00:44:20.011 --> 00:44:23.073]  Hi, sir, and thank you very much for taking my call.
[00:44:23.233 --> 00:44:24.194]  I love the show, by the way.
[00:44:25.294 --> 00:44:27.596]  First time, well, second time caller, and I love your show.
[00:44:28.056 --> 00:44:31.578]  Yeah, I've just been listening to you and Steve Watson there.
[00:44:32.018 --> 00:44:33.579]  Can you turn that TV off, sir?
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.461]  Turn it off, please.
[00:44:35.501 --> 00:44:35.801]  Thank you.
[00:44:37.236 --> 00:44:38.237]  One minute, one minute, one minute.
[00:44:38.497 --> 00:44:39.998]  It's so loud, I can barely hear you.
[00:44:40.499 --> 00:44:43.061]  I'm afraid that you don't want to hear British Eastenders.
[00:44:43.922 --> 00:44:44.322]  Sorry about that.
[00:44:44.722 --> 00:44:59.494]  Yeah, basically, you see what's in the G20 Summit tomorrow, and the way that British government will put people in to antagonistic, to correct situations for innocent protesters to be hurt.
[00:45:00.455 --> 00:45:05.159]  If you go back to like the Yorkshire, I'm a Yorkshire person, so Yorkshire and England, by the way, for you, and the US,
[00:45:05.979 --> 00:45:08.140]  And I remember the Yorkshire miners' strike.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.181]  And I remember there, the government did the same thing.
[00:45:11.321 --> 00:45:14.882]  It was Thatcherism and for them people don't know who Margaret Thatcher is.
[00:45:14.902 --> 00:45:18.564]  She was a big politician in the UK, was a Prime Minister.
[00:45:19.384 --> 00:45:22.665]  And basically I grew up in the 80s and I grew up with Thatcherism as a whole.
[00:45:23.566 --> 00:45:29.828]  And I remember as a kid growing up in the 80s and the miners' strike and seeing how people were provocative and that.
[00:45:30.048 --> 00:45:35.150]  The miners' strike, working people from the northern England, northern part of England,
[00:45:35.862 --> 00:45:45.586]  And basically they would get police from the southern England to come to the northern part to dominate and obviously to start trouble.
[00:45:46.627 --> 00:45:47.587]  What's your take on that?
[00:45:47.607 --> 00:45:49.148]  What do you think will happen tomorrow?
[00:45:51.564 --> 00:45:59.426]  You know, I mean, every other time they hire thugs, it comes out always a week after the police hire thugs or do it themselves and they don't get in trouble for it.
[00:45:59.446 --> 00:46:04.368]  They just go, the police kind of go, uh, yeah, we did it, but we're going to take your rights to keep you safe.
[00:46:05.408 --> 00:46:10.130]  Uh, and then they'll arrest somebody who had fireworks at their house or somebody who had a bottle of whiskey claiming it's a bioweapon.
[00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:11.890]  Uh, you know, that's what they do.
[00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:13.351]  It's all the Tranis World terrorists.
[00:46:13.371 --> 00:46:17.512]  That's what the body scanners going in all the major airports are to scan your naked body.
[00:46:18.072 --> 00:46:18.412]  Yes, Alex.
[00:46:18.432 --> 00:46:20.694]  Thank you for our daily lesson in Anglistics.
[00:46:21.034 --> 00:46:24.176]  Listen, your show is deteriorating into some kind of radio theater of the absurd.
[00:46:24.236 --> 00:46:25.997]  With all this play-acting, hambone, histrionics,
[00:46:45.598 --> 00:46:47.760]  You're making Orson Welles look like a piker.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.861]  Well, thank you.
[00:46:49.941 --> 00:46:50.982]  I'm a fan of Orson Welles.
[00:46:51.442 --> 00:46:51.723]  Really?
[00:46:52.123 --> 00:46:57.707]  Yeah, I doubt the authenticity of those foreign speakers in your EU tape that you just played today.
[00:46:58.528 --> 00:47:00.369]  Put him on hold.
[00:47:00.409 --> 00:47:01.009]  Put him on hold.
[00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:07.174]  Sir, the European Parliament was televised on Europe and the United States.
[00:47:07.234 --> 00:47:09.396]  C-SPAN actually carried what you were just hearing.
[00:47:11.637 --> 00:47:12.638]  Pull up Daniel Hannan.
[00:47:13.079 --> 00:47:14.340]  In fact, we had that video clip earlier.
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.842]  I was going to play it, but I had to play the audio because we weren't live at prison.
[00:47:16.902 --> 00:47:18.003]  I mean, this is real.
[00:47:18.724 --> 00:47:20.986]  I mean, Daniel Hannan is real, sir.
[00:47:21.747 --> 00:47:26.571]  And, you know, I don't screen your calls, but I can't deal with this type of craziness anymore.
[00:47:28.072 --> 00:47:28.413]  Okay?
[00:47:28.473 --> 00:47:29.814]  I mean, this is insanity.
[00:47:30.254 --> 00:47:35.760]  You're saying you doubt the authenticity of the European Parliament stuff.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.141]  Is that what you're saying to me, sir?
[00:47:38.487 --> 00:47:40.388]  I said Brown and Hannon are authentic.
[00:47:40.468 --> 00:47:42.589]  The other speakers I don't believe are authentic.
[00:47:42.849 --> 00:47:47.491]  How can you have a German speaker, a male German speaker, representing a chancellor when she's a woman?
[00:47:48.592 --> 00:47:51.333]  What are you talking about?
[00:47:51.373 --> 00:47:52.834]  I don't understand you!
[00:47:53.254 --> 00:47:54.494]  What are you saying?
[00:47:55.535 --> 00:47:58.196]  I'm saying those so-called foreigners were English actors.
[00:48:01.452 --> 00:48:06.896]  I said Brown and Hannon are legitimate, but they spliced other people in there.
[00:48:07.116 --> 00:48:08.437]  That's not why I called.
[00:48:08.477 --> 00:48:09.498]  Stop, stop, stop.
[00:48:10.158 --> 00:48:15.642]  Sir, I listen to BBC Radio, I listen to Radio Prague, I listen to it all.
[00:48:16.863 --> 00:48:21.447]  It's called XM and Sirius, and I'm addicted to it because I can listen to everything.
[00:48:21.487 --> 00:48:22.267]  I scan around.
[00:48:22.587 --> 00:48:24.369]  I mean, the European Parliament's real.
[00:48:24.949 --> 00:48:26.290]  Those speakers were real.
[00:48:28.962 --> 00:48:30.863]  It's entered a new level of insanity.
[00:48:33.144 --> 00:48:33.505]  Pardon me?
[00:48:34.105 --> 00:48:35.586]  Prime Minister was the president.
[00:48:35.886 --> 00:48:44.010]  How come you didn't mention that, as you had it in your InfoWars website, that he said we're on the way to hell with our inflating our currency?
[00:48:44.511 --> 00:48:48.233]  And we're back into the 1929 to 1930s.
[00:48:48.273 --> 00:48:50.194]  But the reason why I called... Well, hold on a minute.
[00:48:50.234 --> 00:48:52.175]  Now you're accusing me of covering up stuff.
[00:48:52.375 --> 00:48:53.756]  I mean, there's hours of this I can play.
[00:48:55.106 --> 00:48:57.088]  Well, I didn't hear that.
[00:48:58.189 --> 00:48:59.069]  Are you serious?
[00:48:59.109 --> 00:49:01.031]  Hold on.
[00:49:01.071 --> 00:49:01.791]  What are you saying?
[00:49:01.831 --> 00:49:02.912]  I don't understand you, sir.
[00:49:02.932 --> 00:49:08.077]  I mean, you're saying Gordon Brown and Hannon were doing a fake thing?
[00:49:08.097 --> 00:49:09.538]  I mean, what on earth?
[00:49:09.598 --> 00:49:10.899]  And you're saying I'm doing something?
[00:49:11.219 --> 00:49:12.240]  What is it I've done now?
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:13.041]  Who else?
[00:49:13.061 --> 00:49:14.021]  Did I murder somebody?
[00:49:14.081 --> 00:49:16.703]  Or am I a reptoid?
[00:49:16.784 --> 00:49:18.465]  Or is it I work for the Vatican?
[00:49:18.725 --> 00:49:19.506]  Or I work for Israel?
[00:49:19.706 --> 00:49:20.727]  What's the new thing here?
[00:49:21.656 --> 00:49:26.600]  No, I... Drop it, I want to talk about what the Swedish... Drop it!
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:27.401]  Hold on!
[00:49:27.661 --> 00:49:32.025]  You came on my show, and there's lots of this craziness out there.
[00:49:32.085 --> 00:49:33.206]  What are you saying I've done?
[00:49:33.286 --> 00:49:34.427]  What crime have I committed?
[00:49:34.447 --> 00:49:36.729]  I mean, I'm airing fake audio here?
[00:49:36.769 --> 00:49:37.589]  I mean, what is it?
[00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:42.433]  No, I want to get to the Swedish Finance Minister, who is in Berlin.
[00:49:42.794 --> 00:49:46.316]  He was saying the same thing that the Czech President of the EU.
[00:49:46.357 --> 00:49:46.777]  By the way,
[00:49:47.353 --> 00:49:50.214]  Every six months, the presidency of the EU rotates.
[00:49:50.454 --> 00:49:53.374]  They're going to have a Swedish president July 1st.
[00:49:53.654 --> 00:49:56.375]  The Czech minister is going to have... Yeah, they got the Czech Republic guy right now.
[00:49:56.855 --> 00:49:57.395]  Yeah, right.
[00:49:57.795 --> 00:49:59.056]  So... Is he real?
[00:49:59.096 --> 00:49:59.416]  Hold on.
[00:49:59.476 --> 00:50:01.676]  Is he real when he speaks at that same parliament meeting?
[00:50:02.956 --> 00:50:03.777]  Well, yes.
[00:50:04.277 --> 00:50:09.418]  I didn't say... What I said is that those people on that tape... But getting back into this... What?
[00:50:09.458 --> 00:50:09.838]  No, no, no.
[00:50:09.878 --> 00:50:10.818]  I want the specific.
[00:50:11.578 --> 00:50:12.999]  What is wrong with the tape?
[00:50:15.518 --> 00:50:16.800]  And Brown are legitimate.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.303]  It's the other speakers who are not legitimate.
[00:50:21.926 --> 00:50:23.007]  I think those are fakers.
[00:50:23.247 --> 00:50:24.229]  I think those are actors.
[00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:26.732]  One guy was even laughing when he was reading the text.
[00:50:27.072 --> 00:50:29.235]  It sounded like a phony German accent to me.
[00:50:29.755 --> 00:50:30.176]  Okay.
[00:50:30.717 --> 00:50:31.077]  Alright.
[00:50:31.117 --> 00:50:32.318]  Well, it's good to hear from you, buddy.
[00:50:34.281 --> 00:50:34.581]  Whoa!
[00:50:34.601 --> 00:50:40.828]  I mean, we've got all this real New World Order stuff happening, and it is... I mean, they are calling for a global currency.
[00:50:40.848 --> 00:50:42.510]  They are setting up a New World Order.
[00:50:43.811 --> 00:50:46.014]  Barack Obama did fire the GM chief.
[00:50:47.295 --> 00:50:49.437]  They are devaluing the dollar and the pound.
[00:50:49.898 --> 00:50:51.319]  We're just here covering it.
[00:50:54.427 --> 00:51:14.070]  I mean it's just it's just but that guy represents a large portion of people who are just completely mind-blown so you want to stop smoking well here's what I want you to do go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf go to the cashier tell him you don't want to pay for the product you just want to take it home and try it and if and only if you stop smoking will you then come back and pay for it most likely
[00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:19.453]  If you try this, you'd be arrested, but as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the Smokefree Free Trial offer is.
[00:51:19.813 --> 00:51:26.597]  Smokefree is a complete all-natural stop smoking system, and when you call today, they'll send you a 30-day supply of the program absolutely free.
[00:51:26.877 --> 00:51:34.902]  This program eliminates withdrawals and cravings, and includes a 30-day supply of the Smokefree Capsules, a guide to living smoke-free book, and audio support program.
[00:51:35.402 --> 00:51:36.603]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:52:03.627 --> 00:52:05.752]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:06.233 --> 00:52:13.290]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:13.817 --> 00:52:20.023]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:20.403 --> 00:52:22.245]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:22.385 --> 00:52:24.807]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:52:24.888 --> 00:52:35.838]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:36.465 --> 00:52:37.746]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:38.126 --> 00:52:39.547]  It's about a one world government.
[00:52:39.987 --> 00:52:46.310]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:46.891 --> 00:52:54.675]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:55.155 --> 00:52:56.316]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:56.736 --> 00:52:57.897]  The people strike back.
[00:52:59.764 --> 00:53:01.286]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:53:01.466 --> 00:53:02.907]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:53:03.208 --> 00:53:05.450]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:10.635]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:53:11.035 --> 00:53:13.878]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:53:14.219 --> 00:53:17.702]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[00:53:18.129 --> 00:53:30.118]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[00:53:30.678 --> 00:53:32.660]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:33.981]  I use one every day.
[00:53:34.401 --> 00:53:36.843]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:53:37.103 --> 00:53:37.844]  We're good to go.
[00:54:06.044 --> 00:54:08.865]  I guess we've got another fake video clip coming up later.
[00:54:08.885 --> 00:54:12.927]  It was on Fox News Nationwide last night, but it's probably going to be fake too, according to the last caller.
[00:54:13.968 --> 00:54:21.892]  This is Sean Hannity and Dick Morris saying it's a world government takeover and the conspiracy guys are right.
[00:54:23.092 --> 00:54:26.474]  But see, Fox is so discredited now, the liberals will all see that and think it isn't true.
[00:54:27.796 --> 00:54:32.040]  But I'm listening to Liberal Talk Radio, now that I can get channel after channel of it.
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:35.163]  I'm like an XM advertisement here.
[00:54:35.884 --> 00:54:37.886]  And they're all admitting it.
[00:54:38.266 --> 00:54:39.387]  It's just incredible.
[00:54:40.208 --> 00:54:42.771]  But then the conspiracy theorists are saying it doesn't exist.
[00:54:43.151 --> 00:54:44.893]  So that is coming up.
[00:54:46.707 --> 00:54:56.462]  In the next hour, there's a really cruddy YouTube copy of it where somebody shot video off their television, but we happened to be recording it last night, so we're dumping that to the web so we can get it up here and show it to you on PrisonPlanet.tv to analyze it.
[00:54:58.516 --> 00:55:01.737]  Hey, listen, the Obama deception is out, ladies and gentlemen, on DVD.
[00:55:02.437 --> 00:55:12.041]  And not only do you need to have this incredible film, it's up-to-date, shatters the left-right paradigm, shows what the bankers are doing, lays out the world government, shows how both parties are controlled.
[00:55:12.461 --> 00:55:17.423]  This is the film you need, it has a bunch of extras on it, and your purchase also makes this show possible.

[00:55:57.255 --> 00:56:07.900]  You want to find like-minded people, you want to find out who's a listener to the show, and you're out on the town or whatever at work, this is a shirt that isn't too shocking like some of my others, but that will spur conversations.
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:15.621]  So get that at InfoWars.com as well, or by simply calling 888-253-3139.
[00:56:15.641 --> 00:56:16.061]  888-253-3139.
[00:56:16.321 --> 00:56:25.483]  You can also, at the same time, see this film at PrisonPlanet.tv in super high quality.
[00:56:25.943 --> 00:56:27.883]  Okay, let's go back to the callers here.
[00:56:28.443 --> 00:56:30.103]  Let's talk to Pat in Washington.
[00:56:30.163 --> 00:56:31.044]  Pat, you're on the air.
[00:56:31.084 --> 00:56:31.504]  Go ahead.
[00:56:31.524 --> 00:56:32.964]  Hi, Alex.
[00:56:33.824 --> 00:56:35.344]  It's a great show you've got today.
[00:56:35.364 --> 00:56:38.265]  I don't understand what that guy was saying about the tape.
[00:56:40.066 --> 00:56:41.406]  Sounds like he was smoking something.
[00:56:42.766 --> 00:56:47.627]  Anyway, I wanted to bring to your attention something called the ISDA.
[00:56:47.807 --> 00:56:49.028]  I don't know if you're familiar with that.
[00:56:49.328 --> 00:56:51.848]  The International Swaps and Derivatives Association.
[00:56:52.928 --> 00:56:56.849]  They've been around since 1985, since the inception of the idea of derivatives.
[00:56:57.889 --> 00:57:01.150]  And there's all kinds of information on that site.
[00:57:01.610 --> 00:57:09.711]  And it looks like they're planning on fixing a derivative with the performance of European
[00:57:10.729 --> 00:57:16.831]  Union States to offset the negative value.
[00:57:18.632 --> 00:57:22.253]  Yeah, they're going to start a new derivatives bubble through carbon credits.
[00:57:22.313 --> 00:57:23.134]  This is all stated.
[00:57:23.474 --> 00:57:32.017]  And Al Gore and Obama own part of the companies and it's just total conflict of interest and they're calling it a global European Union in Gordon Brown's speech.
[00:57:32.657 --> 00:57:35.318]  Yeah, there's all kinds of information on that site.
[00:57:35.338 --> 00:57:36.919]  They've got yearly activities
[00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:52.583]  Reviews going all the way back on that site and I bet if somebody that knew what they were looking at and looked through that they could see a paper trail going all the way back on their designs for the world economy on that one website.
[00:57:52.623 --> 00:57:57.905]  Well they created this fiat bubble to buy up all the real assets that implode it and make everybody indentured serfs to them.
[00:58:01.547 --> 00:58:02.187]  Good points.
[00:58:02.227 --> 00:58:03.267]  I thought that was interesting.
[00:58:03.327 --> 00:58:09.709]  It'd be really nice to see someone like Webster Tarpley take a look at that site and see if they could actually find some hard evidence from internally.
[00:58:10.129 --> 00:58:18.791]  What do you think of the Boston Globe report that they admit they took the pension insurance money and invested it in derivatives and things?
[00:58:19.511 --> 00:58:30.554]  It's completely amazing to me that not only have they planned all this stuff for the last 50 years, but now they're just openly stating it in public.
[00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:31.580]  You know?
[00:58:32.481 --> 00:58:33.202]  I hear you, brother.
[00:58:33.803 --> 00:58:34.544]  Good to hear from you.
[00:58:34.604 --> 00:58:38.449]  More calls, fourth hour, Bob Schultz, We The People Foundation, straight ahead.
[00:58:41.432 --> 00:58:42.814]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:42.874 --> 00:58:45.818]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.926 --> 00:58:51.507]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:51.607 --> 00:58:56.208]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:56.348 --> 00:58:59.109]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:58:59.310 --> 00:59:02.171]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:02.351 --> 00:59:08.213]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:59:08.433 --> 00:59:11.375]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:11.675 --> 00:59:18.579]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:18.659 --> 00:59:21.801]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:59:21.941 --> 00:59:22.281]  Call 1-800-409-FOOD.
[00:59:23.462 --> 00:59:24.022]  We're good to go!
[00:59:52.717 --> 00:59:54.639]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:57.903]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:15.841]  We are back live, hour number four, coming up in about 15 minutes.
[01:00:16.041 --> 01:00:17.441]  Bob Schultz with the People Foundation.
[01:00:17.861 --> 01:00:23.643]  The beginning of a series we're going to do the next two weeks, plus into tax time with the Private Banker Takeover.
[01:00:23.923 --> 01:00:25.883]  He'll be joining us for the last 45 minutes of the show.
[01:00:25.923 --> 01:00:28.444]  Today, right now, we're taking your phone calls.
[01:00:28.864 --> 01:00:31.004]  John, in the great state of Texas.
[01:00:31.424 --> 01:00:32.485]  You're on the air, John.
[01:00:32.525 --> 01:00:32.905]  Welcome.
[01:00:33.825 --> 01:00:34.625]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[01:00:34.845 --> 01:00:35.425]  Good to talk to you.
[01:00:36.326 --> 01:00:37.846]  I'd just like to say first, I have a
[01:00:39.607 --> 01:00:45.629]  I've got a four-month-old at home and I know what kind of sacrifices you have to do to spend all this time and energy away from your family.
[01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:50.911]  I'd also like to say I really liked your idea a couple of weeks ago.
[01:00:50.951 --> 01:00:58.673]  You were talking about having either a show or a series of shows where you just had law enforcement call in because you were saying that they always say that they never get a chance to call in.
[01:00:59.534 --> 01:01:00.694]  I think that would be really important.
[01:01:00.774 --> 01:01:03.095]  Oh my gosh, you just reminded me of another show I promised to do.
[01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:07.393]  But it's all the taxes, financial stuff that really weighs me down.
[01:01:07.433 --> 01:01:11.376]  Dealing with the infrastructure of 20 plus employees, for me it's a learning experience.
[01:01:11.757 --> 01:01:21.305]  But I promise to do a big two hour concentration camp show today, I guess I'll do it later this week, ahead of Glenn Beck's debunking of it with Popular Mechanics next Monday.
[01:01:22.386 --> 01:01:25.128]  So I've got to, I guess not go home today.
[01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:30.513]  I was planning to go see the family for about three hours, but I've made that promise and it's important to get all that data back together.
[01:01:32.572 --> 01:01:34.833]  And go over it all, but we're going to do that.
[01:01:35.173 --> 01:01:36.133]  What else is on your mind, sir?
[01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:38.594]  Nothing just that.
[01:01:38.614 --> 01:01:53.259]  You know, I listen every day and this stuff just, that last caller, not the last caller, but that guy, you know, people just debate the most ridiculous issues when, you know, the truth is right there in front of them.
[01:01:54.156 --> 01:01:59.240]  You know, I always think, I've heard you mention several times, you know, it's either tyranny or freedom.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.422]  Like, you know, once we have freedom, we can debate all this other stuff, you know?
[01:02:03.643 --> 01:02:17.373]  Yeah, and you know, it all becomes an obsession with me when we have this track record of success, a track record of telling the truth, a track record of building people up and not infighting, a track record of trying to get folks to walk their own road, just to wake up to the systems manipulating them.
[01:02:17.994 --> 01:02:21.957]  And instead, as we get bigger and bigger, I find that a lot of folks that are in the New World Order
[01:02:22.617 --> 01:02:25.100]  They're just mad at anybody who's successful, including the elite.
[01:02:25.381 --> 01:02:32.950]  They don't even want us to be successful fighting the globalists, and as we have success, that almost upsets them, and we can't be for real, because we're having success.
[01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.431]  I mean, it's a...
[01:02:35.083 --> 01:02:39.808]  It's like a plan to fail type deal that's built in, but it doesn't matter.
[01:02:39.828 --> 01:02:41.350]  We've just got to ignore it and move forward.
[01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.691]  We don't have a choice.
[01:02:42.731 --> 01:02:43.852]  This stuff's coming down on us.
[01:02:43.932 --> 01:02:45.474]  All I'm doing is putting out the info.
[01:02:45.754 --> 01:02:49.138]  We post almost everything we talk about on the show right here on the website.
[01:02:49.158 --> 01:02:51.340]  It's infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:53.282]  And it's not about Alex Jones.
[01:02:53.322 --> 01:02:54.904]  It's about the information.
[01:02:55.524 --> 01:02:55.864]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:14.929]  It's all bull.
[01:03:37.538 --> 01:03:42.500]  It's all discredited, but it just kind of mixes together in this big amalgam of delusionalness.
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.642]  And it doesn't upset me that I'm being attacked, it upsets me that these people are that crazy.
[01:03:48.402 --> 01:03:56.945]  And that that's what discredits us, is that frankly, just because the establishment lies or spins, doesn't mean that the whole mass of humanity, the establishment comes from humanity.
[01:03:57.505 --> 01:03:59.086]  You know, it just takes all kinds, but...
[01:04:00.546 --> 01:04:00.826]  I don't know.
[01:04:00.866 --> 01:04:10.175]  I mean, just knowing what's coming down on us, I can't believe that people have turned this into like a high school, who's cool, who's not, you know, and everybody hates the football captain.
[01:04:10.315 --> 01:04:12.418]  And, you know, it's so much fun.
[01:04:12.718 --> 01:04:14.319]  And folks, I'm not your football captain.
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:21.366]  I'm somebody here risking my life, busting my butt, to look at the amount of work we do, look at the dedication, look at the fruits of the tree!
[01:04:22.367 --> 01:04:24.788]  You talk to 80% of people, what woke you up with the New World Order?
[01:04:24.808 --> 01:04:25.708]  It didn't Ron Paul!
[01:04:25.948 --> 01:04:26.828]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:04:27.188 --> 01:04:30.269]  Ron Paul came on the show last year and said, half our support's been from your show.
[01:04:30.529 --> 01:04:31.690]  I didn't prompt him to say that.
[01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:36.591]  But like Rodney Dangerfield said, I still can't get any respect.
[01:04:36.631 --> 01:04:37.151]  What were you saying?
[01:04:37.852 --> 01:04:43.273]  I didn't say if they would do five seconds of research, they would find out that, you know, you put all your information out there for free.
[01:04:43.333 --> 01:04:45.174]  It's not about Alex Jones, like you said, you know.
[01:04:45.794 --> 01:04:47.014]  It's about the info.
[01:04:47.434 --> 01:04:48.355]  I hear your brother got a job.
[01:04:48.395 --> 01:04:49.235]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:55.132]  It's just we got this whole world government coming down on us, and there's all this idiocy going on.
[01:04:55.192 --> 01:04:57.014]  But that's part of the human process.
[01:04:57.054 --> 01:04:58.655]  A lot of positive things are happening, though.
[01:04:58.675 --> 01:04:59.556]  The awakening's on.
[01:05:00.256 --> 01:05:10.345]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:05:10.825 --> 01:05:11.886]  Garden in a can.
[01:05:12.246 --> 01:05:15.809]  Garden in a can is your source for premium, long-term, storable seeds.
[01:05:16.389 --> 01:05:18.151]  Garden in a can is ready when you are.
[01:05:18.411 --> 01:05:20.693]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[01:05:21.153 --> 01:05:30.223]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[01:05:30.843 --> 01:05:31.844]  Garden in a can.
[01:05:32.265 --> 01:05:33.126]  It's that simple.
[01:05:33.466 --> 01:05:35.328]  Fresh, healthy, easy.
[01:05:35.868 --> 01:05:39.813]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[01:05:40.193 --> 01:05:41.094]  Ready when you are.
[01:05:41.753 --> 01:05:45.394]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden in a Can.
[01:05:45.834 --> 01:05:48.915]  For more details, visit Gardeninacan.com today.
[01:05:49.316 --> 01:05:51.056]  That's Gardeninacan.com.
[01:05:51.456 --> 01:05:51.836]  Or call 866-598-7396.
[01:05:51.856 --> 01:05:51.916]  866-598-7396.
[01:05:51.956 --> 01:05:53.997]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:06:02.972 --> 01:06:05.093]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:05.594 --> 01:06:12.598]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:06:13.166 --> 01:06:19.371]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:19.751 --> 01:06:21.592]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:21.732 --> 01:06:24.134]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:24.234 --> 01:06:35.162]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:35.803 --> 01:06:37.084]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:37.484 --> 01:06:38.845]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:06:39.324 --> 01:06:45.672]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:06:46.233 --> 01:06:54.043]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:54.504 --> 01:06:55.666]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:56.086 --> 01:06:57.268]  The people strike back.
[01:06:59.187 --> 01:07:02.129]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:07:02.289 --> 01:07:07.512]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:07:07.812 --> 01:07:13.155]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:07:13.516 --> 01:07:14.636]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.997 --> 01:07:23.882]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:07:24.322 --> 01:07:25.944]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:07:26.144 --> 01:07:30.329]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[01:07:30.369 --> 01:07:34.994]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:07:35.395 --> 01:07:37.477]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[01:07:39.219 --> 01:07:39.980]  Keep it natural.
[01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:43.903]  Call Calbin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:07:44.363 --> 01:07:48.466]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[01:07:48.706 --> 01:07:53.890]  Try Calbin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:57.873]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:08:00.496 --> 01:08:02.717]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.278 --> 01:08:06.080]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.734 --> 01:08:15.874]  Yeah.
[01:08:32.392 --> 01:08:38.375]  Before I take a few calls and then we're going to get Bob Schultz with the People Foundation on, I wanted to play this clip.
[01:08:38.736 --> 01:08:51.182]  This is from Fox News that you're about to see of Hannity and Dick Morris admitting the New World Order global takeover and admitting that we the conspiracy theorists are right because we knew how to read government documents 10, 15, 20 years ago.
[01:08:52.563 --> 01:08:53.904]  All we are is people that did research.
[01:08:54.204 --> 01:08:55.725]  And we're evil, we're bad, I understand that.
[01:08:55.745 --> 01:09:01.248]  That's why there's all these police reports demonizing us, but now they've been forced to retract those in Missouri and other places.
[01:09:01.608 --> 01:09:06.671]  Because no, we're the patriots, we're the good guys, we're not the ones stealing your pensions like the foreign banks.
[01:09:06.691 --> 01:09:07.472]  Here's the video clip.
[01:09:08.032 --> 01:09:09.293]  They campaign as moderates.
[01:09:09.333 --> 01:09:13.714]  Did you ever think in our lifetime we'd be getting lectures from the communist Chinese on capitalism?
[01:09:14.034 --> 01:09:20.097]  That Nicolas Sarkozy and other leaders of France, that we'd be getting lectures... Criticizing us for spending so much.
[01:09:20.137 --> 01:09:25.659]  Criticizing America and warning America, interestingly, not to go down the path to socialism.
[01:09:25.959 --> 01:09:32.742]  There is a big thing that's going to happen in London at this G20 and then they're hiding it, they're camouflaging it, they're not talking about it.
[01:09:33.762 --> 01:09:36.083]  Coordination of international regulation.
[01:09:36.683 --> 01:09:43.465]  What they are going to do is to put our Fed and our SEC under the control, in effect, of the IMF.
[01:09:43.745 --> 01:09:44.165]  Oh, come on.
[01:09:44.205 --> 01:09:45.126]  Do you believe they'll do this?
[01:09:45.206 --> 01:09:46.946]  That's what was in the draft agenda.
[01:09:47.406 --> 01:09:49.747]  They call it coordination of regulation.
[01:09:50.167 --> 01:09:54.428]  What it really is, is putting the American economy under international regulation.
[01:09:54.929 --> 01:09:59.550]  And those people who have been yelling, oh, the UN's going to take over, global governments...
[01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:02.871]  They've been crazy, but now they're right.
[01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:23.881]  What they always do at these conferences is they have the center show is here, and the side show they don't want you to pay attention to.
[01:10:23.901 --> 01:10:26.723]  The center show is the size of the stimulus package.
[01:10:27.123 --> 01:10:34.087]  The real show is international regulation of the financial institutions, which is going to happen under the IMF control.
[01:10:34.407 --> 01:10:37.910]  And remember, the IMF is run by Europeans, the World Bank by Americans.
[01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:40.712]  DickMorris.com, thanks Dick, appreciate it.
[01:10:41.752 --> 01:10:45.495]  Well, I told you before I even knew this this morning, last night,
[01:10:46.471 --> 01:10:48.193]  That I'm listening to XM.
[01:10:48.253 --> 01:10:53.879]  Now I don't just listen to WAI or KLBJ 590 or the Houston talk stations, Dallas talk stations.
[01:10:53.919 --> 01:10:57.443]  I would flip through those and monitor and I would hear the talking points.
[01:10:58.945 --> 01:11:00.287]  You know, I do this in the morning, do this in the evening.
[01:11:00.307 --> 01:11:03.971]  My wife says, go get milk at the grocery store at, you know, 11 at night.
[01:11:04.011 --> 01:11:04.752]  She forgets to get it.
[01:11:05.072 --> 01:11:06.233]  I'm driving down there, I listen.
[01:11:06.493 --> 01:11:07.354]  Now I got XM.
[01:11:08.314 --> 01:11:09.275]  And man, it's just BAM!
[01:11:09.335 --> 01:11:09.715]  BAM!
[01:11:09.775 --> 01:11:10.135]  BAM!
[01:11:10.175 --> 01:11:10.475]  BAM!
[01:11:10.535 --> 01:11:19.961]  Japanese, Russian news in English, all the conservative shows, all the liberal shows, and they're going, I'm losing my pension fund, the New World Order's real, look!
[01:11:20.341 --> 01:11:24.044]  Folks, we didn't just guess there was a global currency being set up.
[01:11:24.084 --> 01:11:27.826]  We didn't just guess they were going to bankrupt the world economy by design to do it.
[01:11:28.106 --> 01:11:31.488]  We got the IMF World Bank documents in 2002 in January.
[01:11:32.028 --> 01:11:34.490]  I wrote a book about it, Dissent and the Tyranny has chapters on it.
[01:11:36.118 --> 01:11:40.140]  All we've done is try to warn people, and now it's here, they're taking your pension funds, everything!
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:41.501]  I mean, I don't know what I'm supposed to do!
[01:11:44.323 --> 01:11:51.807]  And, you know, what they don't tell you is the CFR, with almost 5,000 members in the U.S., openly calls for a world government that's been setting this up.
[01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:54.009]  They don't tell you Geithner's going along with it.
[01:11:54.329 --> 01:11:55.950]  They don't tell you both parties are controlled.
[01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:59.494]  But I guess they're going to have to now in the near future because it's all happening.
[01:11:59.514 --> 01:12:02.736]  Look, we always said, for 14 years I've been on air.
[01:12:03.116 --> 01:12:05.778]  Because I was talking to the experts, you know, the old dogs in the fight.
[01:12:05.798 --> 01:12:06.799]  I've been doing it for decades.
[01:12:06.839 --> 01:12:07.619]  Many of them dead now.
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.922]  And these were colonels and generals in the military.
[01:12:10.962 --> 01:12:13.383]  These were, you know, auditors for the IRS.
[01:12:13.423 --> 01:12:18.107]  These were people who'd been in the government, been invited into this, and that's how they knew the plan.
[01:12:19.574 --> 01:12:21.416]  And then we got the documents.
[01:12:22.176 --> 01:12:22.997]  And we knew this.
[01:12:23.617 --> 01:12:26.039]  And that's how we told you everything that was going to happen.
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:28.541]  And I made films and books and we're on record.
[01:12:29.142 --> 01:12:32.385]  And of course we're right, but we don't deserve any special credit.
[01:12:33.305 --> 01:12:34.346]  We just did the research.
[01:12:34.687 --> 01:12:42.373]  It's like I talk about the analogy is, knowing all this stuff is like knowing what's coming on TV tonight.
[01:12:42.733 --> 01:12:43.594]  It's a TV guide.
[01:12:45.834 --> 01:12:49.819]  My wife will call sometimes and say, hey, there's a James Bond movie on TV tonight.
[01:12:49.839 --> 01:12:50.400]  You want to watch it?
[01:12:51.842 --> 01:12:55.246]  Back when I had such time to do things years ago, and I'd say, yeah.
[01:12:56.087 --> 01:12:58.770]  And then I'd come home and the movie's on TV, and we'd sit around.
[01:13:00.902 --> 01:13:03.143]  You know, eat a late night dinner or whatever if the kids are asleep and watch it.
[01:13:03.704 --> 01:13:10.448]  And it isn't like she's psychic and I bow down to her and go, my gosh, how did you know James Bond was on the night or how did you know the Super Bowl was on this Sunday?
[01:13:11.188 --> 01:13:13.109]  It's all openly announced.
[01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:17.132]  All we're doing is telling you what they've publicly said.
[01:13:17.152 --> 01:13:18.773]  That's all.
[01:13:20.472 --> 01:13:35.163]  What they won't tell you at Fox is, well I guess they do now, they put out a video a month ago, we played it here, put out by Fox with all these movie stars and TV stars saying Fox movies, Fox TV, Fox, all of it is programming to accept global carbon tax and global government.
[01:13:38.976 --> 01:13:42.239]  Rupert Murdoch is at the very top of the upper echelon of power.
[01:13:42.679 --> 01:13:43.580]  He's all for it.
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:48.323]  You know, his papers and TV stations he owns in Europe push and promote this and bash the United States.
[01:13:49.124 --> 01:13:53.267]  But then here, he says none of it's going on and then bashes Europe.
[01:13:53.347 --> 01:13:55.569]  See, it's all about playing us off against each other.
[01:13:57.170 --> 01:13:58.671]  Go ahead and get Bob Shultz on for us.
[01:13:58.691 --> 01:14:04.015]  We're going to take calls too, coming up with him on with us, but for everybody that's holding.
[01:14:06.197 --> 01:14:07.598]  It's very exhausting though.
[01:14:08.956 --> 01:14:11.377]  Because I have a passion to expose this.
[01:14:12.938 --> 01:14:15.439]  And I can't control myself not to expose it.
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:23.724]  I mean, there are hundreds of stories we break, hundreds of things we cover, a lot of original documents, bills we read, we put it out first, gets a lot of attention.
[01:14:24.164 --> 01:14:31.608]  It's not, it's only because I can't control myself and I just can't stop reading and researching and documenting and going over it all.
[01:14:32.168 --> 01:14:36.711]  And I have this literal tingle in my stomach, goosebumps, you know, on my neck, hair standing up.
[01:14:39.485 --> 01:14:43.851]  Because it isn't just a global currency and a global government and global regulations and carbon taxes.
[01:14:44.191 --> 01:14:51.381]  They say once they have that in place they're going to stage a lot of more terror attacks, blaming on shadowy enemies, lock down the cities even more.
[01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:56.537]  You think people dying of vaccines is bad now?
[01:14:56.597 --> 01:14:58.018]  You think all the soft kill weapons are bad now?
[01:14:58.038 --> 01:14:59.499]  This has all just been beta testing.
[01:14:59.819 --> 01:15:01.280]  Then it gets even more horrific.
[01:15:01.541 --> 01:15:03.682]  I mean, once you're in the New World Order, it's bad.
[01:15:03.742 --> 01:15:10.226]  So, we always knew that when they finally made the big move, they've been setting it up behind the scenes for a long time, that they would have to announce it.
[01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:12.888]  And that was their strong point and their weak point.
[01:15:13.128 --> 01:15:13.969]  Their flux point.
[01:15:15.182 --> 01:15:22.089]  Where things aren't as rigid, where they're reaching in trying to remold the world, the architecture, we can reach in and stop what they're doing.
[01:15:22.249 --> 01:15:25.232]  The struggle is now, the key crossroads.
[01:15:30.714 --> 01:15:33.997]  You know, I've interviewed Bob Schultz many times, but I guess I don't have his bio today.
[01:15:34.017 --> 01:15:36.779]  I'd like to go over his bio as we go to him here.
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:38.721]  Bob, just introduce yourself.
[01:15:38.761 --> 01:15:44.125]  Tell folks a little bit about your background in corporate stuff and then how you woke up to the private Federal Reserve and the scam.
[01:15:44.165 --> 01:15:54.734]  I want to talk about the nature of it and everything, but I also want to talk about how it comes out that all these IRS agents don't pay it, most of the Congress doesn't pay it, most of Obama's administration doesn't pay it, a lot of the governors don't pay it.
[01:15:55.914 --> 01:15:56.615]  Hey Alex, great to be on again.
[01:15:56.675 --> 01:15:56.975]  Thank you.
[01:16:18.888 --> 01:16:25.350]  Got an engineering degree from one of the five federal academies, the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point on Long Island in New York.
[01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:28.731]  Have a Master's in Business and Finance from Xavier.
[01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:36.072]  Completed just about all the coursework required for a PhD in Public Administration from the Graduate School of Public Affairs at the State University of New York at Albany.
[01:16:36.252 --> 01:16:40.494]  Started my career as an engineer with the Gas Turbine Department at the General Electric Company in Schenectady.
[01:16:41.774 --> 01:16:45.775]  After a few years, moved over to the Corporate Research and Development Center
[01:16:46.687 --> 01:17:02.132]  Group of some 600 scientists and engineers, and based on some work I was doing there, the Republican governor of Connecticut, a fellow named Meskel, asked if I would go to Connecticut and start up and administer a new state agency, get some laws on the books in Connecticut in this field that I was specializing in.
[01:17:03.472 --> 01:17:05.713]  Was there for three years, did that, came back to New York.
[01:17:05.853 --> 01:17:14.575]  The Democrat governor of New York, Hugh Carey, asked if I would run a policy office and try to get some laws on the books in New York in this field that I was specializing in.
[01:17:14.635 --> 01:17:15.076]  I did that.
[01:17:15.136 --> 01:17:16.296]  I was a full-time advisor.
[01:17:17.406 --> 01:17:32.478]  To the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to hire to try and get some business principles embedded in this huge, huge public works bureaucratic program under the Clean Water Act that funds a lot of the nation's sewer and water works.
[01:17:32.498 --> 01:17:34.080]  It's there for a year.
[01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:41.326]  Was an investment banker with Prudential Bait Securities on the public finance side for four or five years.
[01:17:42.186 --> 01:17:45.009]  Started up a management consulting company and
[01:17:46.442 --> 01:17:47.483]  I don't know, I woke up when I was 40.
[01:17:49.985 --> 01:17:52.648]  Something happened in my neighborhood in upstate New York.
[01:17:53.108 --> 01:18:10.564]  I realized the government was manufacturing a crisis and had prescribed a solution that was going to benefit a few of them and their friends, but at everybody else's expense, which is bad enough, but to make matters worse, they're going to violate the law in the process.
[01:18:13.109 --> 01:18:14.610]  Tried to get some questions answered.
[01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:16.011]  They wouldn't answer the questions.
[01:18:16.091 --> 01:18:17.191]  I had to go to court.
[01:18:17.891 --> 01:18:26.456]  And a very robust decision, the highest court in the state gave us everything we were asking for under the results of a countywide referendum.
[01:18:26.796 --> 01:18:35.640]  They had brought the people to the polls by their noses, telling the people based on entirely what the government was telling them, they went ahead and approved this project.
[01:18:36.241 --> 01:18:40.183]  But we undid the results of a countywide referendum and nullified the resolutions passed by all
[01:18:41.092 --> 01:18:45.275]  The Town and County Boards in approving and financing the project.
[01:18:45.355 --> 01:18:47.196]  But that changed my view of government.
[01:18:47.236 --> 01:18:55.000]  Until then, I had been led to believe that government was always benevolent, always had the public interest up most in its mind, and that these were the good guys.
[01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:58.802]  You could trust these people except for the, you know, every now and then somebody got caught with their hand in a cookie jar.
[01:18:58.843 --> 01:18:59.903]  But all of that changed.
[01:19:01.144 --> 01:19:07.968]  And then a few years later, I was the subject of some retaliation by the town that was the lead defendant in that case.
[01:19:08.547 --> 01:19:14.630]  So now I've not only learned that government is not above manufacturing a crisis, but they can hurt you simply because they don't like you.
[01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:17.811]  They can be vindictive.
[01:19:18.791 --> 01:19:35.238]  So I decided it was my responsibility as an American to start paying better attention, to be better informed about what my rights were under the state and federal constitutions, of course, but also start paying
[01:19:35.868 --> 01:19:43.370]  More attention to what government was actually saying and doing and comparing its behavior with the requirements of our state and federal constitutions.
[01:19:43.630 --> 01:19:49.532]  And for a long time, Bob, you've been talking about the derivatives bubble, all that as well, so you've got a unique perspective on that.
[01:19:49.852 --> 01:19:55.294]  We'll get into the criminal IRS, what you've been doing since then, the We The People Foundation, all the great work you've done.
[01:19:55.994 --> 01:19:58.875]  On the other side with Bob Schultz, an amazing individual.
[01:19:58.915 --> 01:19:59.375]  Stay with us.
[01:20:00.339 --> 01:20:00.879]  You worry.
[01:20:01.239 --> 01:20:02.960]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.541]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:20:05.961 --> 01:20:07.761]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:20:08.081 --> 01:20:09.282]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:20:09.682 --> 01:20:12.883]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:20:13.283 --> 01:20:18.144]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:20:18.524 --> 01:20:21.846]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:20:22.486 --> 01:20:23.826]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:20:24.166 --> 01:20:26.767]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[01:20:27.087 --> 01:20:30.028]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:20:30.529 --> 01:20:38.714]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:20:39.175 --> 01:20:43.558]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[01:20:43.998 --> 01:20:47.700]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[01:20:48.021 --> 01:20:53.424]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:20:53.844 --> 01:20:56.746]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:20:57.247 --> 01:20:59.268]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[01:21:00.598 --> 01:21:05.829]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:06.625 --> 01:21:11.988]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:12.509 --> 01:21:18.692]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:18.993 --> 01:21:20.814]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:20.974 --> 01:21:23.355]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:21:23.435 --> 01:21:34.322]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:21:36.616 --> 01:21:37.857]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:38.277 --> 01:21:39.677]  It's about a one world government.

[01:22:37.892 --> 01:22:38.152]  I think so.
[01:22:59.773 --> 01:23:03.038]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:23:03.198 --> 01:23:07.284]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:23:07.464 --> 01:23:15.435]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[01:23:15.695 --> 01:23:16.135]  We're good to go!
[01:23:48.274 --> 01:23:51.096]  This is the end Beautiful friend This is the end
[01:24:17.754 --> 01:24:45.436]  My only friend, the end Of our elaborate plans, the end Of everything that stands, the end No safety, no surprise, the end I'll never look into your eyes
[01:24:47.056 --> 01:24:47.657]  Okay.
[01:24:49.097 --> 01:24:50.078]  We are back live.
[01:24:50.118 --> 01:24:51.739]  Bob Schultz with the People Foundation.
[01:24:51.759 --> 01:24:55.000]  It's just impossible to cover all the good work they've done.
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:25:00.223]  National ads exposing the IRS as a scam, unconstitutional, never ratified.
[01:25:00.243 --> 01:25:03.104]  IRS agents hearing it, researching it for years.
[01:25:03.184 --> 01:25:08.487]  Treasury agents going public, being indicted, being found not guilty in courts.
[01:25:08.587 --> 01:25:10.208]  I mean, this has been hellish.
[01:25:10.848 --> 01:25:16.410]  But hunger strikes, congressman involved, just an amazing individual.
[01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:18.231]  Okay, we've recapped how you woke up.
[01:25:18.611 --> 01:25:23.833]  Now, how you got into the IRS, what's currently happening, the world government coming out in the open, Bob Schultz.
[01:25:23.913 --> 01:25:25.994]  I mean, our credibility now couldn't be higher.
[01:25:26.034 --> 01:25:27.775]  It is the platinum standard.
[01:25:30.376 --> 01:25:31.216]  Yes.
[01:25:32.237 --> 01:25:39.760]  After 20 years of confronting governmental wrongdoing in New York State,
[01:25:40.822 --> 01:26:06.689]  I turned my attention to the federal government in 1999, and one of the first issues that, well, we brought an action against Clinton and Robert Rubin, who was the Treasury Secretary at the time, regarding the bailout of the Mexican peso, and Janet Reno asked the court to dismiss the case
[01:26:07.423 --> 01:26:11.305]  Based on sovereign immunity, saying that the government was sovereign, we had no right to sue it.
[01:26:11.425 --> 01:26:12.625]  Of course, we prevailed there.
[01:26:13.946 --> 01:26:16.607]  But then eventually the court dismissed the case for lack of standing.
[01:26:16.647 --> 01:26:34.095]  We brought an action against the President, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretary of Defense for applying the armed forces of the United States and hostilities overseas in the Republic of Yugoslavia without a declaration of war, as the Constitution requires.
[01:26:35.202 --> 01:26:36.543]  The court dismissed that action in 1999.
[01:26:37.824 --> 01:26:51.656]  We then turned our attention, learned about Joe Bannister, turned our attention to help him get answers to the questions that he asked his superiors at the IRS office in San Jose.
[01:26:51.676 --> 01:26:55.019]  Yeah, he was a treasury armed agent as part of their enforcement bureau.
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:59.103]  Yes, a special agent, criminal investigation division, a badge, a gun,
[01:26:59.713 --> 01:27:01.093]  He's an extremely bright young man.
[01:27:01.413 --> 01:27:02.234]  And he heard D.V.
[01:27:02.254 --> 01:27:07.115]  Kidd, he'd been there seven years, making great money, doing good, loved the whole family in law enforcement.
[01:27:07.495 --> 01:27:08.115]  He hears D.V.
[01:27:08.155 --> 01:27:11.175]  Kidd on Bay Area Radio, stops his car, writes notes.
[01:27:11.555 --> 01:27:16.216]  He's going to expose this liar about the IRS being a scam and sending money to foreign banks.
[01:27:17.177 --> 01:27:22.258]  And he did two years of research, we were the first to interview him, and boom, he found out it was all true.
[01:27:23.518 --> 01:27:23.938]  Exactly.
[01:27:24.018 --> 01:27:28.099]  And so he submitted a report to his superiors simply asking them to help him understand.
[01:27:28.504 --> 01:27:32.566]  And answer some questions, and rather than do that, they showed him the door.
[01:27:32.626 --> 01:27:33.487]  They forced him out.
[01:27:34.087 --> 01:27:39.750]  We learned about that and decided to help him get answers to his questions.
[01:27:40.911 --> 01:27:51.936]  And we went through years of attempting to get the government to address these issues and answer these questions.
[01:27:52.236 --> 01:27:56.979]  Everything from full-page ads in the USA Today, as you say, a hunger fast.
[01:27:59.023 --> 01:28:11.851]  We had press conferences covered by C-SPAN at the National Press Club, which we had Joe Bannister and Bill Benson and Larry Becraft, but to no avail.
[01:28:13.932 --> 01:28:24.178]  So that was the first of the federal issues that we attacked with petitioning for a remedy to this grievance and government refusing to respond.
[01:28:26.254 --> 01:28:31.275]  We've turned our attention, and we're still attempting, to get the government to respond to those questions.
[01:28:31.335 --> 01:28:37.077]  But along the way, we decided to start focusing on other violations of the Constitution.
[01:28:37.777 --> 01:28:50.321]  And so we've petitioned the government for a remedy to various other grievances involving violations of the Constitution, including the government's violation of the, again, the War Powers Clause under the Iraq Resolution.
[01:28:51.141 --> 01:28:55.102]  We've petitioned them for a redress of the grievance regarding
[01:28:55.956 --> 01:29:04.505]  The violation of the so-called privacy clauses by the USA Patriot Act, the Federal Reserve Act and its violation of the money clauses.
[01:29:06.026 --> 01:29:10.611]  We've petitioned over the government's development.
[01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:15.016]  All the facts suggest the government is developing a North American Union.
[01:29:16.041 --> 01:29:20.423]  Which would effectively, as you know, obliterate our northern and southern boundaries.
[01:29:20.484 --> 01:29:30.949]  I don't mind if Mexico is the 51st state and Canada is the 52nd, if they apply for statehood and they're approved and they have state constitutions that guarantee their citizens the rights that our state countries guarantee.
[01:29:30.969 --> 01:29:33.151]  That's right, under globalist systems you don't have that.
[01:29:34.091 --> 01:29:36.091]  Under the globalist systems, you don't have that.
[01:29:36.572 --> 01:29:38.032]  Bob Schultz, long segment coming up.
[01:29:38.072 --> 01:29:38.972]  Plenty of time to get into this.
[01:29:38.992 --> 01:29:42.113]  Let's talk about the latest with the IRS as they're fully discredited.
[01:29:42.433 --> 01:29:48.174]  It turns out most of the folks, literally most of the people in the government aren't even paying the stinking things because they know it's a fraud too.
[01:29:48.234 --> 01:29:48.654]  Stay with us.
[01:29:48.674 --> 01:29:49.294]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:50.275 --> 01:29:51.155]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.675 --> 01:29:53.255]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.195 --> 01:29:56.896]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:01.433]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:30:01.613 --> 01:30:03.879]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[01:30:04.039 --> 01:30:08.049]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[01:30:08.189 --> 01:30:10.094]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout...
[01:30:14.462 --> 01:30:15.343]  For the rest of you,
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:48.503]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:30:48.543 --> 01:30:53.607]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:13.763 --> 01:31:19.948]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:20.348 --> 01:31:22.189]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:22.329 --> 01:31:24.731]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:24.831 --> 01:31:35.619]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:36.411 --> 01:31:37.692]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:38.072 --> 01:31:39.473]  It's about a one world government.
[01:31:39.933 --> 01:31:46.256]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:31:46.837 --> 01:31:54.621]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:55.101 --> 01:31:56.262]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:56.682 --> 01:31:57.883]  The people strike back.
[01:32:00.157 --> 01:32:03.540]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:08.905]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:32:09.085 --> 01:32:13.869]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:32:14.230 --> 01:32:25.360]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:31.302]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:32:31.522 --> 01:32:37.585]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:32:37.785 --> 01:32:38.445]  What about you?
[01:32:38.825 --> 01:32:44.848]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:34:38.739 --> 01:34:44.021]  Also, another one of the fine sponsors that makes this radio show possible is Pmemory.net.
[01:34:44.041 --> 01:34:48.102]  You spend all this time listening to the show every day, but how much of the information can you actually recall?

[01:34:52.004 --> 01:34:52.964]  How about two weeks ago?
[01:34:54.093 --> 01:34:55.894]  And if you cannot recall it, then what's the point?

[01:35:27.083 --> 01:35:32.349]  And lastly, of the sponsors we want to thank to make this radio show possible is Survival Seed Bank.
[01:35:32.910 --> 01:35:34.391]  Survivalseedbank.com.
[01:35:34.431 --> 01:35:40.236]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[01:35:40.576 --> 01:35:46.061]  There have been times in American history, Pilgrim for example, when seeds have the highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold.
[01:35:46.601 --> 01:35:51.225]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds, waged by the global elite, who want to control us by controlling the food supply.
[01:35:51.945 --> 01:35:53.086]  Governments are storing seeds.
[01:35:53.386 --> 01:35:54.527]  The UN is storing seeds.
[01:35:54.567 --> 01:35:56.969]  Globalists of every stripe are storing seeds near the Arctic Circle.
[01:35:57.310 --> 01:35:58.190]  Why do you think this is?
[01:35:58.370 --> 01:35:58.851]  You know why.
[01:35:58.911 --> 01:35:59.671]  Control and power.
[01:36:00.592 --> 01:36:04.259]  Solutions from science is trying to get seeds out of the globalist's hands into the hands of the people.
[01:36:04.639 --> 01:36:05.681]  One seed bank at a time.
[01:36:05.821 --> 01:36:06.623]  One family at a time.
[01:36:07.403 --> 01:36:13.446]  The Survival Seed Bank from Solutions from Science contains enough open-pollinated seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:36:13.986 --> 01:36:17.668]  Seeds in the Survival Seed Bank are hand-picked for exceptional germination rates.

[01:36:22.210 --> 01:36:24.812]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com from Solutions and Science.

[01:36:25.832 --> 01:36:26.012]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:36:32.705 --> 01:36:35.707]  I want to thank our sponsors because they also make this transmission possible.
[01:36:36.147 --> 01:36:38.548]  Be sure and support our local affiliate sponsors as well.
[01:36:38.628 --> 01:36:40.649]  They make this radio show possible.
[01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:43.491]  Now, going back to Bob Schultz with the People Foundation.
[01:36:43.811 --> 01:36:57.359]  Specifically, tell folks about the work you've done encapsulating that, what's currently going on with the criminal IRS, and then tie that in, I'm sure you're up on this, how it's coming out that a lot of the government doesn't pay their taxes, including the Treasury Secretary.
[01:36:59.226 --> 01:36:59.886]  Yeah, it's true.
[01:37:00.527 --> 01:37:11.694]  We have folks in government that continue to act as though they are, you know, privileged autocrats while they enslave the rest of us, believing they're above the law.
[01:37:12.455 --> 01:37:15.717]  The rest of us can read and comprehend.
[01:37:15.837 --> 01:37:21.801]  Thousands of people continue to read and comprehend, cannot find the law that makes them liable.
[01:37:22.441 --> 01:37:24.142]  Many of them are small businessmen.
[01:37:24.202 --> 01:37:27.084]  They can't find the law that makes them, that requires them to withhold.
[01:37:27.921 --> 01:37:29.381]  Pay earned by their employees.
[01:37:29.441 --> 01:37:34.702]  We continue to... Many individuals cannot find the law that requires them to file and pay this tax.
[01:37:35.523 --> 01:37:45.445]  So they, like Joe, Bannister, and many, many others, they write their congressmen, they write the IRS, they ask them to answer these questions, help them understand.
[01:37:45.525 --> 01:37:46.685]  They get no response.
[01:37:46.725 --> 01:37:48.945]  So as free Americans, they act on their beliefs.
[01:37:49.145 --> 01:37:51.146]  As individuals, they act on their beliefs.
[01:37:51.186 --> 01:37:56.247]  Then, of course, the government comes down and, with a ton of, like a ton of bricks, and just
[01:37:57.301 --> 01:38:00.962]  Takes the legs right out from under them, and turns their lives upside down.
[01:38:01.983 --> 01:38:12.086]  And in many cases, you have some suicides, you have homes, families completely destroyed, simply because the government will not answer questions.
[01:38:12.326 --> 01:38:13.707]  Yeah, there's no due process either.
[01:38:13.727 --> 01:38:15.027]  These aren't regular courts.
[01:38:15.447 --> 01:38:16.467]  Same with family courts.
[01:38:16.527 --> 01:38:19.508]  It's just this criminal system they've set up in the last 90 years.
[01:38:20.829 --> 01:38:26.631]  Yeah, and so, you know, we learn from all of this, Alex, that individuals and small groups
[01:38:27.509 --> 01:38:28.430]  Cannot prevail.
[01:38:28.450 --> 01:38:44.542]  This guy, Mahatma Gandhi, that brought India out from under British rule, he said correctly that when the people are up against unjust and uncivil government and laws, and they are entitled to reform, as we are, they'll get it only if they follow a three-part formula.
[01:38:44.722 --> 01:38:47.224]  Because if you're missing any one of the three parts, you're going to fail.
[01:38:47.364 --> 01:38:50.527]  You need to be proactive, non-violent, and you need a mass movement.
[01:38:50.587 --> 01:38:51.768]  You need a critical mass.
[01:38:52.488 --> 01:38:54.490]  Of course, there was this fella, Martin Luther King,
[01:38:55.458 --> 01:39:02.962]  Who wrote, Jr., who wrote a piece in 1953 about Gandhi and this formula, and he said, that's the formula I'm going to follow.
[01:39:03.042 --> 01:39:05.443]  And he was able to apply it successfully.
[01:39:06.064 --> 01:39:08.405]  Proactive, nonviolent, mass movement.
[01:39:09.145 --> 01:39:15.488]  And so we've exhausted this foundation with the assistance of tens of thousands of people across the country for ten years.
[01:39:16.109 --> 01:39:18.230]  We have established a solid record.
[01:39:19.065 --> 01:39:31.934]  Of petitioning, you know, identifying with facts these violations of all of these provisions of the Constitution, whether it's the War Powers Clauses, the Money Clauses, the Tax Clauses, the Privacy Clauses, and so forth.
[01:39:32.395 --> 01:39:42.442]  We have laid out, with the assistance of constitutional scholars like Ed Vieira and Walker Todd and others, we've documented these violations, and we have
[01:39:42.987 --> 01:39:48.311]  Petitioned the government under the First Amendment, last ten words, the Petition Clause, the Accountability Clause.
[01:39:48.371 --> 01:39:53.115]  The founders put those ten words there knowing that this day would come.
[01:39:53.195 --> 01:40:00.240]  Knowing that people in government will have a natural tendency to step outside the boundaries that we the people have drawn around their power.
[01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:11.228]  And so, they have given us, right there in the document, the last ten words of the Accountability Clause, the right to petition for redress of grievances, and under those last, the meaning of those last ten words is if
[01:40:11.863 --> 01:40:14.264]  We have some evidence that government has violated the Constitution.
[01:40:14.305 --> 01:40:15.145]  We can call them on it.
[01:40:15.765 --> 01:40:17.066]  We can petition for a remedy.
[01:40:17.386 --> 01:40:19.267]  They are obligated to respond.
[01:40:19.548 --> 01:40:25.211]  If they do not respond, then we have a government that, in effect, has turned its back on the Constitution.
[01:40:25.271 --> 01:40:27.372]  We've called them on it, the servant government.
[01:40:27.412 --> 01:40:34.457]  They refuse to respond, then we have the right to withdraw our money and our resources and our support from that government.
[01:40:34.497 --> 01:40:38.499]  But, of course, as individuals and small groups, you know, you can't prevail.
[01:40:38.679 --> 01:40:40.000]  So we need a mass movement.
[01:40:40.492 --> 01:40:45.315]  We've exhausted, with this record that we've established, we have exhausted our administrative remedies.
[01:40:45.715 --> 01:40:47.376]  We've exhausted our judicial remedies.
[01:40:47.856 --> 01:40:51.318]  It's now time to take a page out of the Founders Playbook.
[01:40:51.818 --> 01:40:55.621]  They found themselves in the exact same situation that we're now in.
[01:40:56.261 --> 01:41:05.946]  In 1774, two years before they signed the Declaration of Independence, they had petitioned their government, a government that was the strongest, most powerful government on the face of the earth.
[01:41:05.966 --> 01:41:06.747]  They ruled the seas.
[01:41:06.787 --> 01:41:08.708]  They had a huge standing army here after the
[01:41:09.301 --> 01:41:16.606]  The French were defeated in the French and Indian War, and they started treating the people in our colonies differently from the way they were treating their people back in Great Britain.
[01:41:17.067 --> 01:41:23.251]  And we, the founders, they started to petition for a redress of these grievances, and they petitioned for 11 years.
[01:41:23.791 --> 01:41:30.076]  And as the Declaration of Independence says, and our petitions were repeated petitions were answered only with repeated injury.
[01:41:31.169 --> 01:41:32.031]  And what did they do?
[01:41:32.091 --> 01:41:35.757]  They decided to get together two or three of their number from each of their homes.
[01:41:35.777 --> 01:41:45.292]  And let me just add, let me just interrupt you because the more they said, hey you're corrupt, hey you're stealing property, hey you're taxing us, you're acting like thugs, you've got militarized police.
[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:49.843]  The Crown, King George III, would only beef up the number.
[01:41:50.764 --> 01:41:53.006]  Same thing happening, but now it's even worse than the British.
[01:41:53.766 --> 01:41:55.848]  The British at least weren't looting their own country.
[01:41:56.569 --> 01:41:59.051]  Now, the elite are just stealing everything.
[01:41:59.111 --> 01:42:10.340]  It's gone to a new level of corruption, where now the foreign bankers have imploded everything and have stolen $12 trillion in the last six months and are just destroying, and they're just stealing it all and running offshore.
[01:42:11.101 --> 01:42:12.222]  So now it's even worse.
[01:42:12.702 --> 01:42:17.543]  Yes, the grievances we're suffering are, as you say, much worse, okay?
[01:42:17.703 --> 01:42:19.203]  But we need to do what they did.
[01:42:19.563 --> 01:42:24.844]  The solution here is to have a Continental Congress, as they did.
[01:42:24.984 --> 01:42:28.025]  They decided, all right, look, we're going to get together in Philadelphia.
[01:42:28.185 --> 01:42:31.845]  We're going to talk about these grievances and settle on some course of action.
[01:42:32.325 --> 01:42:37.006]  Alex, they did not, as you know, they did not go there to sign a Declaration of Independence.
[01:42:37.026 --> 01:42:38.787]  They did not go there to separate.
[01:42:38.847 --> 01:42:40.787]  Maybe an exception, maybe Sam Adams.
[01:42:41.437 --> 01:42:41.817]  I don't know.
[01:43:01.385 --> 01:43:06.926]  And then reconvene in 75 and 76, and along the way things really got hot, and eventually they decided to separate.
[01:43:07.046 --> 01:43:08.987]  That's right, and that's what's happening now.
[01:43:09.107 --> 01:43:12.588]  That's what's happening now with the states declaring sovereignty, the people waking up.
[01:43:12.688 --> 01:43:18.149]  We're in the process of being reasonable, saying, look, made-off people are stealing everything.
[01:43:18.529 --> 01:43:20.789]  You've taken the pension funds and given them to derivatives.
[01:43:20.829 --> 01:43:22.610]  The government stole the government pension funds.
[01:43:22.970 --> 01:43:25.991]  Boston Globe today, look, you're criminals.
[01:43:26.031 --> 01:43:26.831]  You need to stop.
[01:43:26.871 --> 01:43:27.591]  You need to stop.
[01:43:28.351 --> 01:43:29.072]  Go ahead.
[01:43:29.552 --> 01:43:32.374]  Alex, the Constitution, as you know, it doesn't defend itself.
[01:43:32.454 --> 01:43:33.575]  It just lies on your desk.
[01:43:33.655 --> 01:43:34.936]  The government isn't going to defend it.
[01:43:35.437 --> 01:43:37.758]  We can't rely on the states to get us out of this mess.
[01:43:37.798 --> 01:43:39.760]  No, it's an animating contest.
[01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:47.866]  Yeah, and so the Constitution is going to be defended only if the people defend it.
[01:43:47.946 --> 01:43:54.191]  The first step is to get a few of our number, a few people with a proven passion for the Constitution.
[01:43:54.631 --> 01:43:55.812]  Three would do.
[01:43:56.092 --> 01:43:57.073]  Three from each state.
[01:43:57.423 --> 01:43:59.224]  With a proven passion for the Constitution.
[01:43:59.284 --> 01:44:00.284]  People of good character.
[01:44:00.704 --> 01:44:02.625]  People respected in their communities and so forth.
[01:44:03.666 --> 01:44:05.706]  As authors, scholars, activists and so forth.
[01:44:06.087 --> 01:44:08.608]  Get them together.
[01:44:08.628 --> 01:44:13.530]  150 of us meeting every day at a Continental Congress.
[01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:16.811]  Not to be confused with a Constitutional Convention.
[01:44:16.831 --> 01:44:17.811]  They're entirely different.
[01:44:18.071 --> 01:44:18.992]  But every day.
[01:44:19.172 --> 01:44:21.613]  The cause of America is still the cause of the world.
[01:44:21.653 --> 01:44:23.233]  The lamp of liberty was lit here.
[01:44:23.854 --> 01:44:24.394]  Nowhere else.
[01:44:24.781 --> 01:44:34.565]  There's great interest around the world in preserving this constitutional republic that we've been blessed with.
[01:44:34.885 --> 01:44:36.506]  And so let's get these people together.
[01:44:36.966 --> 01:44:40.087]  Let's have them every day with facts.
[01:44:40.427 --> 01:44:41.848]  No opinions, facts.
[01:44:42.433 --> 01:44:44.054]  These are the prohibitions.
[01:44:44.154 --> 01:44:45.115]  These are the restrictions.
[01:44:45.255 --> 01:44:46.076]  These are the mandates.
[01:44:46.096 --> 01:44:53.621]  Well, I think it's a great idea, but you can only have 150 and not all the kooks and infiltrators, because they'll come in and try to stir up trouble.
[01:44:53.661 --> 01:44:54.842]  I think you need to get Ron Paul.
[01:44:54.862 --> 01:44:57.804]  You need to get some of these leading state reps that have been calling.
[01:44:59.865 --> 01:45:00.285]  Exactly.
[01:45:00.365 --> 01:45:03.488]  All the leaders, including yourself, Alex, this is an invitation to you.
[01:45:03.948 --> 01:45:09.752]  All of the leaders of these Constitution-based, liberty and freedom-oriented organizations need to come together.
[01:45:10.487 --> 01:45:17.972]  I've just reserved and paid for 11 rooms at Jekyll Island for May 13th.
[01:45:18.412 --> 01:45:23.496]  Judy and I are getting on a train in New Jersey, and we're taking that train down to Jessup, Georgia.
[01:45:23.516 --> 01:45:25.577]  We're taking a ride over to Jekyll Island.
[01:45:26.161 --> 01:45:30.746]  Where we will spend all day, Wednesday and Thursday, and then take the train back.
[01:45:30.866 --> 01:45:32.587]  I've already called Ed Griffin.
[01:45:32.928 --> 01:45:34.069]  He says it's a great idea.
[01:45:34.169 --> 01:45:34.990]  I'll get on the train.
[01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:36.271]  I've called Ed Vieira.
[01:45:36.631 --> 01:45:37.692]  He says it's a great idea.
[01:45:37.732 --> 01:45:38.293]  I'll get on the train.
[01:45:38.333 --> 01:45:39.834]  And again, this could be a prototype.
[01:45:39.874 --> 01:45:42.357]  I didn't know you were going to announce this on the air, and I'll certainly come.
[01:45:43.678 --> 01:46:06.954]  It can be a prototype for even bigger ones in the future, and then to have others mimic it, to have a national debate of the people through a Declaration of Independence to lay out the swarms of bureaucrats eating out our substance, the quartered troops among us, the usurpations, the having legislatures erected in faraway lands, global government.
[01:46:07.154 --> 01:46:07.994]  You got it, Alex.
[01:46:08.154 --> 01:46:10.376]  The idea is to bring these leaders together to
[01:46:12.509 --> 01:46:13.730]  Lay out the groundwork.
[01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:19.273]  Help prepare the groundwork for, and do the groundwork for, a Continental Congress.
[01:46:19.353 --> 01:46:27.918]  A Continental Congress where you have people with a proven passion for the Constitution getting together every day with a worldwide webcast.
[01:46:28.018 --> 01:46:39.445]  So every day, their deliberations, their discussions, their debates, and then eventually their decision-making process is webcast around the world, and everything uttered in that room is
[01:46:39.864 --> 01:46:39.984]  Yes.
[01:47:01.756 --> 01:47:02.836]  Get the mass movement.
[01:47:03.177 --> 01:47:11.619]  All we can do is set up 50 state websites and have all of the information about the Continental Congress, what it is, why it was convened, what the issues are, and the progress.
[01:47:12.079 --> 01:47:13.700]  You know, all the news coming out of the Continental Congress.
[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:25.004]  Yeah, but that was state legislator leaders and others who, you know, would just be nominated by their own legislature to be sent to the original one.
[01:47:26.964 --> 01:47:29.385]  But today, Alex, I think you would admit the state
[01:47:30.291 --> 01:47:32.592]  are inextricably intertwined.
[01:47:54.703 --> 01:47:58.365]  Can you imagine the squabbling and arguing about who would go to that and the power trip of it?
[01:48:01.527 --> 01:48:05.930]  How would a state nominate somebody to send them then if it's not through the legislature?
[01:48:06.530 --> 01:48:11.934]  Here's the procedure, and on our website there is a link for the procedure.
[01:48:11.994 --> 01:48:17.718]  First of all, we say that the people that are to be nominated and chosen
[01:48:18.402 --> 01:48:22.065]  Our people have a proven passion for the Constitution, right?
[01:48:22.085 --> 01:48:25.708]  So we get all these nominations, we get all of these, you know, the full spectrum.
[01:48:25.828 --> 01:48:32.694]  We then, we are hiring a company, we pay 30 bucks apiece to find out if that person is who they say they are.
[01:48:32.754 --> 01:48:33.434]  That's all we do.
[01:48:33.514 --> 01:48:40.841]  Then we turn it over to the leaders of these liberty-oriented groups in the states to complete the vetting process.
[01:48:41.301 --> 01:48:45.384]  Then those names get placed on the state website, and then by affidavit,
[01:48:46.567 --> 01:48:52.771]  You know, paper ballots, hand marked, hand counted, people cast their votes based on the nominees that are on that page.
[01:48:53.631 --> 01:48:57.314]  And the people in the states, the people in the Freedom Movement, they know who these people are.
[01:48:57.334 --> 01:49:05.599]  And these state coordinators and their assistants and so forth, we know who they are, Alex, and they decide
[01:49:06.249 --> 01:49:09.532]  Uh, who they're going to put on the state website.
[01:49:09.872 --> 01:49:09.992]  Good.
[01:49:10.053 --> 01:49:11.474]  Well, I'll support it.
[01:49:11.514 --> 01:49:12.415]  I wish you guys luck.
[01:49:12.475 --> 01:49:13.055]  It sounds good.
[01:49:13.095 --> 01:49:14.356]  We need more stuff like this.
[01:49:15.637 --> 01:49:16.318]  So, you know what?
[01:49:16.338 --> 01:49:19.621]  I'll have you back on next week or something to talk more about because we're almost out of time.
[01:49:20.221 --> 01:49:28.148]  But this is, you know, just this is a process, the evolution, the development of the second American Revolution we hope to carry out in a freedom-oriented manner.
[01:49:28.689 --> 01:49:30.330]  Overall, Bob... Yeah, go ahead.
[01:49:30.550 --> 01:49:31.772]  Alex, mark your calendar.
[01:49:32.748 --> 01:49:36.932]  The train leaves on the 12th from New Jersey, of course it stops in D.C.
[01:49:36.972 --> 01:49:37.893]  and Richmond and so forth.
[01:49:40.275 --> 01:49:42.757]  We'll put out an article, I forget the train number, I think it's number 97.
[01:49:43.698 --> 01:49:49.423]  But anyway, it gets down there, it's an overnight trip, Judy and I have reserved a sleeper car.
[01:49:50.263 --> 01:49:57.570]  We arrive there on the morning of the 13th, a Wednesday, we're there all day, and all day Thursday, and then we take the train back.
[01:49:57.590 --> 01:49:58.691]  So put on your calendar,
[01:49:59.484 --> 01:50:04.791]  Uh, make that trip with us and, uh, Ed Viera, Ed Griffin, all of these other folks are agreeing to make that train ride.
[01:50:04.851 --> 01:50:05.752]  Join us, please.
[01:50:06.313 --> 01:50:07.534]  And we'll lay the groundwork.
[01:50:07.574 --> 01:50:10.338]  We'll, we'll deal with issues like you're raising.
[01:50:10.854 --> 01:50:16.177]  You know, how best to choose these people who will be the delegates.
[01:50:16.197 --> 01:50:19.078]  Yeah, so this is a preliminary planning meeting to then launch that.
[01:50:19.159 --> 01:50:19.539]  Oh, sure.
[01:50:19.779 --> 01:50:37.128]  Well, that sounds like some great footage anyway, so I'd like to bring my cameras and the new Obama film is going to be done by mid-May, though, and then I've got to sit off the mass-produce for July 4th, but regardless, I could put that into another film, because that's important, and to get the message out, that's our committee's, of course, fondness.
[01:50:37.148 --> 01:50:38.529]  We've got to start pushing back, Alex.
[01:50:38.689 --> 01:50:42.090]  The people have to push back, and they have to do it by the numbers.
[01:50:42.130 --> 01:50:45.811]  Without that critical mass or mass movement, you know, it's... I agree with you.
[01:50:45.911 --> 01:50:46.571]  I had no idea.
[01:50:46.591 --> 01:50:52.113]  I just said a week ago, hey, Bob Schultz, I haven't talked to him in a while, and he's gotten a lot done, so I'm very excited.
[01:50:52.153 --> 01:50:56.094]  I'd like to be involved with it and promote it and everything here on the radio, so that's very exciting.
[01:50:56.574 --> 01:50:58.295]  We'll come back with a final segment with our guest.
[01:50:58.315 --> 01:50:58.735]  Stay with us.
[01:50:59.963 --> 01:51:05.666]  People around the world are testifying that their cataracts are quickly disappearing like magic thanks to Can-C.
[01:51:05.806 --> 01:51:15.691]  The original Can-C eyedrop used in clinical trials maintains that only the original unadulterated formula is effective in reducing, reversing and slowing the occurrence of senile cataracts.
[01:51:15.811 --> 01:51:20.155]  CanSee can also assist in lowering the intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma.
[01:51:20.295 --> 01:51:27.262]  CanSee is beneficial for contact lens disorders, to treat corneal disorders, combat eye strain, can ease computer vision syndrome, and more.
[01:51:27.382 --> 01:51:33.148]  People enjoying the benefits while using CanSee report no side effects and the drops are gentle and don't cause eye burning.
[01:51:33.248 --> 01:51:41.153]  With regular use, people using CAN-C drops report a difference in their vision in as little as 30 days, and some have their cataracts completely disappear within months.
[01:51:41.413 --> 01:51:59.245]  CAN-C, that's CAN dash letter C, is available now by calling 888-212-8871, that's 888-212-8871, or order online at Nutrimedical.com, that's N-U-T-R-I-Medical.com, your source for the most powerful nutraceuticals and wellness protocols from a doctor you can trust.
[01:52:00.521 --> 01:52:05.754]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:06.563 --> 01:52:11.906]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:12.427 --> 01:52:18.610]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:18.931 --> 01:52:20.752]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:20.912 --> 01:52:23.293]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:23.373 --> 01:52:34.260]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:36.554 --> 01:52:37.794]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:38.214 --> 01:52:39.615]  It's about a one world government.
[01:52:40.075 --> 01:52:46.416]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:46.976 --> 01:52:54.758]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:55.238 --> 01:52:56.379]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:56.799 --> 01:52:57.999]  The people strike back.
[01:52:59.682 --> 01:53:07.447]  What I'm about to read is not intended to scare you, but the LA Times just reported that unemployment will exceed record 1945 levels.
[01:53:07.828 --> 01:53:10.289]  Millions are about to find themselves out of work.
[01:53:10.450 --> 01:53:10.790]  Will you?
[01:53:11.010 --> 01:53:15.893]  Look, I say this not to scare you, but to empower and motivate you to make a choice.
[01:53:16.234 --> 01:53:23.759]  You can sit around waiting for the worst to happen, or you can go to IncomeAtHome45.com right now and take control of your future.
[01:53:24.079 --> 01:53:27.402]  IncomeAtHome45.com is adding people in record numbers.
[01:53:27.583 --> 01:53:28.724]  They're looking for you.
[01:53:28.904 --> 01:53:32.848]  They're connected to a multi-billion dollar company and again, they're looking for you.
[01:53:33.108 --> 01:53:38.893]  IncomeAtHome45.com is the way real people just like you are earning life-changing money from home.
[01:53:39.534 --> 01:53:39.794]  I think so.
[01:54:03.379 --> 01:54:05.840]  You know, I said I'd take some of your calls.
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:09.260]  We did in the last hour, end of this hour, but we're just not going to be able to.
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:11.001]  So everybody call back tomorrow and we'll get to you.
[01:54:11.521 --> 01:54:13.121]  Take a lot of calls coming up in the next few days.
[01:54:13.141 --> 01:54:15.842]  It's just that this is too important with what Bob Schultz is talking about.
[01:54:16.362 --> 01:54:17.602]  Spirit of Liberty is everywhere.
[01:54:17.662 --> 01:54:18.302]  Sons of Liberty.
[01:54:18.322 --> 01:54:19.022]  Daughters of Liberty.
[01:54:19.482 --> 01:54:20.042]  Arise!
[01:54:20.082 --> 01:54:21.023]  Defend your Republic.
[01:54:21.423 --> 01:54:23.043]  They're openly announcing world government.
[01:54:23.403 --> 01:54:25.584]  Openly announcing the foreign banks have stolen all the money.
[01:54:25.604 --> 01:54:28.844]  I mean, Boston Globe, where they're stealing the pension funds.
[01:54:29.544 --> 01:54:31.285]  The government's giving the pension funds to the
[01:54:32.825 --> 01:54:33.706]  Derivatives houses?
[01:54:35.147 --> 01:54:37.229]  I mean, this level of criminality even shocks me.
[01:54:37.249 --> 01:54:38.371]  These people are so bold.
[01:54:38.851 --> 01:54:42.054]  Bob Schultz, We The People Foundation, give out the website for folks that want to visit it.
[01:54:43.215 --> 01:54:45.297]  WeThePeopleCongress.org
[01:54:47.662 --> 01:54:49.763]  WeThePeopleCongress.org.
[01:54:50.264 --> 01:54:54.627]  We have that up on the TV screen right now as we simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:55.047 --> 01:54:58.750]  We'll definitely have you back up as this develops and I'll probably take your invitation to that.
[01:54:58.770 --> 01:55:08.598]  I'm just so tied down here with work and the info war trying to just awaken the minds out there, set the fires of liberty that grow into huge infernos.
[01:55:09.098 --> 01:55:14.362]  But specifically, does it even shock you being from business to just see the lawlessness that's going on?
[01:55:17.033 --> 01:55:27.382]  It's dumbfounding that this could go on, you know, simply because 65 million people vote for somebody, you know, that we can't overturn the will of the voters.
[01:55:27.402 --> 01:55:28.923]  You know, the Constitution means nothing.
[01:55:29.203 --> 01:55:33.167]  Sorry, but that Constitution is the supreme law of the land.
[01:55:33.187 --> 01:55:34.928]  The problem is it doesn't defend itself.
[01:55:35.028 --> 01:55:35.749]  We've got to do that.
[01:55:35.849 --> 01:55:37.170]  The record is clear, Alex.
[01:55:37.991 --> 01:55:42.755]  For 10 years now, we've been establishing this record with the assistance of tens of thousands of people around the country.
[01:55:43.311 --> 01:55:53.821]  We have petitioned, we have documented these violations, as you have, but we've documented these violations of various provisions, restrictions, mandates of the Constitution.
[01:55:54.281 --> 01:56:07.994]  But, importantly, we have petitioned with the assistance of constitutional scholars, professionally, intelligently, rationally, laid it out, served them all, and our repeated petitions are being answered only with repeated injury.
[01:56:08.590 --> 01:56:13.191]  And so, the question is, what's the appropriate next step for a free people to take?
[01:56:13.251 --> 01:56:22.714]  Just as the founders had a record of petitioning for 11 years, we have this solid record of petitioning for redress, and our petitions are being answered.
[01:56:23.255 --> 01:56:24.795]  And to dream is destiny.
[01:56:24.855 --> 01:56:26.516]  We have to know this is our course.
[01:56:26.576 --> 01:56:32.177]  I mean, we have right on our side, the people are waking up, the corruption is evident, just like the Declaration of Independent States.
[01:56:32.697 --> 01:56:37.159]  This is another great solution, and I commend you with the work that you're doing.
[01:56:38.127 --> 01:56:38.708]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:56:38.768 --> 01:56:39.869]  Look forward to working with you.
[01:56:40.429 --> 01:56:40.870]  No, you bet.
[01:56:40.890 --> 01:56:44.033]  I look forward to, and I'm just glad I thought to get you on.
[01:56:44.053 --> 01:56:44.934]  I didn't even know you were planning this.
[01:56:44.954 --> 01:56:46.435]  I know you're always out there doing such great work.
[01:56:46.775 --> 01:56:55.884]  You know, overall, discrediting the IRS as a criminal group and paying for the interest on the debt, as Ronald Reagan's commission showed, I mean, that's now widely known.
[01:56:56.224 --> 01:56:59.287]  And the fact that a lot of government people aren't paying taxes, that's now widely known.
[01:57:00.308 --> 01:57:03.890]  So the establishment is just upping their looting and just saying, we don't care.
[01:57:03.970 --> 01:57:12.095]  We're telling Congress if they don't do what the executive says, they'll declare martial law, and that's mainstream news, and I have congressmen on the show who've been threatened.
[01:57:12.135 --> 01:57:14.096]  I mean, this is la-la land that's going on.
[01:57:14.336 --> 01:57:21.100]  We got in the Fed protest around the country, we got the Secret Army documents, called them and they confirmed it, that the Army Intelligence is spying on us.
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:26.183]  I mean, Army, Pentagon, you work for the bankers, we're the good guys.
[01:57:27.222 --> 01:57:28.843]  And we have an accountability clause.
[01:57:28.883 --> 01:57:29.964]  We can hold them accountable.
[01:57:30.404 --> 01:57:32.225]  We can do it constitutionally and legally.
[01:57:33.085 --> 01:57:42.311]  We just have to do it by the book, and we have to make sure that the sympathies of people around the country and around the world go to us, not the government.
[01:57:42.811 --> 01:57:49.815]  You know, we have to connect the dots in the minds of many people, Alex, and that's what the Continental Congress will do.
[01:57:50.456 --> 01:57:53.077]  Every day we will go through these violations with facts.
[01:57:53.277 --> 01:57:56.379]  Every day we will go through these attempts to hold the government accountable.
[01:57:56.864 --> 01:58:08.538]  And every day with facts, we will show that the government simply refuses, absolutely refuses to be held accountable, refuses to justify... Alright, very exciting, completely rogue government.
[01:58:09.179 --> 01:58:13.403]  Bob Schultz, with thepeoplecongress.org, we'll talk to you soon.
[01:58:13.423 --> 01:58:14.044]  Very exciting.
[01:58:14.325 --> 01:58:15.226]  Godspeed, my friend.
[01:58:15.706 --> 01:58:16.326]  Stay well, Alex.
[01:58:16.466 --> 01:58:16.786]  Stay well.
[01:58:16.986 --> 01:58:17.106]  Bye.
[01:58:17.226 --> 01:58:18.527]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:58:18.547 --> 01:58:19.707]  That's it for this transmission.
[01:58:20.907 --> 01:58:24.268]  A huge, packed, very informative show from pillar to post.
[01:58:24.808 --> 01:58:27.288]  It restarts on the internet streams one place.
[01:58:27.308 --> 01:58:30.309]  My website's InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:30.369 --> 01:58:32.889]  EnsembleCast at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.929]  One place on the web.
[01:58:34.289 --> 01:58:36.210]  All over MNFM's will be re-airing us.
[01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:37.170]  God bless you.
[01:58:37.190 --> 01:58:38.130]  Spread the word about the show.
[01:58:38.410 --> 01:58:38.790]  Take care.
[01:58:41.751 --> 01:58:43.091]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:49.940 --> 01:58:50.520]  Hello, friends.
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:51.521]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:58:51.641 --> 01:58:56.223]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:56.363 --> 01:58:59.124]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:58:59.344 --> 01:59:02.185]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:02.385 --> 01:59:07.087]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:07.327 --> 01:59:08.248]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:08.448 --> 01:59:11.410]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:11.691 --> 01:59:18.596]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:18.676 --> 01:59:21.819]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
