[00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:00.555]  We're good.
[00:00:10.058 --> 00:00:18.803]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv simulcasting the radio show over the internet at PrisonPlanet.tv with a lot of live viewers.
[00:00:18.823 --> 00:00:22.525]  I want to say hi to them and all the radio listeners as well.
[00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:31.310]  And we're going to be taking your phone calls for the entirety of this hour because if I get into any news I will get sidetracked and won't take a lot of your phone calls.
[00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.371]  I'm going directly to your calls right now at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:35.272]  Then after I do that I'm going to break down
[00:00:39.714 --> 00:00:56.382]  The psychology of Barack Obama and the media literally saying he is the one, he is the savior, he will fix everything so they can sell the public on signing on to that bandwagon to fully abolish the Bill of Rights and Constitution and bring in carbon taxes, youth brigades, all of it.
[00:00:57.342 --> 00:00:59.683]  And the new Bank of the United States, they're talking about setting up.
[00:00:59.923 --> 00:01:02.103]  There will be another private central bank.
[00:01:02.683 --> 00:01:06.445]  Just incredible things all coming down at once right now.
[00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:13.746]  Normally we wouldn't see the amount of changes, for the worse, towards the world government in ten years that we're seeing in a week or two.
[00:01:13.867 --> 00:01:16.887]  Everything is accelerated right now.
[00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:19.728]  Everything is hyper.
[00:01:20.908 --> 00:01:22.349]  It's a quickening at every level.
[00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.191]  So I'm going to be going over that and a lot of other financial news.
[00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:31.675]  Also, A&E has a new drama TV show where 9-11 truthers are terrorists who want to kill U.S.
[00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:33.877]  troops, and they're also marijuana heads.
[00:01:33.897 --> 00:01:35.738]  So the message is, if you smoke marijuana, you're a terrorist.
[00:01:35.818 --> 00:01:37.039]  If you're a 9-11 truther, you're a terrorist.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.104]  I want to go over that and play a video clip from that as well, and that ties into the Violent Radicalization Act.
[00:01:43.584 --> 00:01:43.784]  I don't
[00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.802]  Flash bang type bombing that busted a window at the Joint Armed Forces Recruiting Station in Times Square.
[00:02:09.202 --> 00:02:14.205]  Then mainstream news simultaneously with no evidence said it's probably a 9-11 truther.
[00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:16.046]  We then saw Bill O'Reilly.
[00:02:16.847 --> 00:02:17.727]  We saw Glenn Beck.
[00:02:17.767 --> 00:02:25.072]  We saw all the major channels in unison say 9-11 truthers need to be arrested and quote tortured and taken to Guantanamo Bay.
[00:02:25.672 --> 00:02:26.253]  And tasered.
[00:02:26.673 --> 00:02:29.255]  Now, that is in my film, by the way, Truth Rising.
[00:02:29.275 --> 00:02:29.935]  We show that.
[00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:36.259]  And then New York police come up and say, your cameras are guns, and your backpack is a bomb.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.162]  And they say, we know it's not a gun, we know it's not a bomb, we're gonna frame you.
[00:02:40.602 --> 00:02:41.243]  On camera!
[00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.322]  I mean, that is corruption when on camera they do this.
[00:02:45.382 --> 00:02:50.287]  So, they wouldn't be doing that if 9-11 Truth wasn't such a threat and such a danger to them.
[00:02:50.307 --> 00:02:53.290]  So, all of you out there, the millions of you spreading the word, I commend you.
[00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:56.153]  So, that is coming up later in the show.
[00:02:56.193 --> 00:02:59.597]  Also, I want to get more into all over the United States, England and Europe.
[00:03:00.337 --> 00:03:18.340]  The government is kicking old people out of their houses, and the very bureaucrats that kick them out of their houses and make them go to nursing homes, or send them to the euthanasia centers, the government hospice facilities, I'm not saying all hospice, but the main ones, are eugenics, and are euthanizing people with morphine, basically, and not feeding them.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.421]  And the Wall Street Journal's even covered that.
[00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:22.021]  This is out of the Globe and Mail.
[00:03:22.081 --> 00:03:26.082]  Council official evicted elderly tenants from bungalows, then moved herself in.
[00:03:26.442 --> 00:03:28.262]  Then it goes on to say a bunch of them are doing this.
[00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:31.084]  This is the type of stuff that we're dealing with here.
[00:03:31.464 --> 00:03:38.810]  This disgusting piece of human detritus right here on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.333]  We're showing you a photo of her on the front page of the newspaper there.
[00:03:42.734 --> 00:03:46.056]  Also, gender-bending chemicals in our rivers grow more potent.
[00:03:46.697 --> 00:03:50.440]  This is a real environmental crisis, but Barack Obama isn't going to do anything about that.
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.941]  They're not going to do anything about that in England either.
[00:03:52.842 --> 00:03:53.323]  This is
[00:03:54.932 --> 00:04:02.005]  Again, about taxing the carbon cycle of life itself to regulate all human activity to micromanage our lives.
[00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:06.272]  So, I'm going to go ahead now and I am going to
[00:04:08.818 --> 00:04:09.779]  Go to your phone calls.
[00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.921]  Oh, I just got hot news in from Kurt Nemo.
[00:04:14.082 --> 00:04:15.543]  This is absolutely incredible.
[00:04:15.843 --> 00:04:20.726]  Barack Obama has told you he's going to do a lot of things that are unpopular as soon as he gets in the first hundred days.
[00:04:20.947 --> 00:04:26.490]  Tarpley was right six months ago that it was going to be, even before he got elected, a blitzkrieg when he first came in.
[00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.454]  That's why the media is hyping him up, building him up as the savior now, so that everybody will sign on and go along with it.
[00:04:32.822 --> 00:04:35.124]  Oh my gosh, Kurt Nemo's got a story here.
[00:04:35.204 --> 00:04:48.015]  House considers repealing 22nd Amendment at Obama's request, and that would allow, of course, a foreigner to be president and so many other things.
[00:04:49.056 --> 00:04:51.077]  So we're going to be going over all of that today.
[00:04:51.097 --> 00:04:55.061]  There's a bunch of new anti-Second Amendment bills being introduced in the House.
[00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:56.322]  I mean, they're coming, folks.
[00:04:57.282 --> 00:04:57.743]  It's on.
[00:04:58.423 --> 00:04:58.804]  It's on.
[00:04:59.571 --> 00:05:12.003]  Barack Obama, when he was a state senator and a federal senator, called for total gun bans, and even wrote the bills with hand notes on them, and has said he believes it's reasonable what Chicago and D.C.
[00:05:12.023 --> 00:05:14.526]  have, which is a total gun ban of the people.
[00:05:15.246 --> 00:05:16.608]  A monopoly enforced by the state.
[00:05:17.168 --> 00:05:18.289]  I mean, I've been hit from all sides.
[00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:19.450]  There's so much that's happening.
[00:05:20.171 --> 00:05:23.574]  Let's go to your phone calls as promised here.
[00:05:24.582 --> 00:05:27.103]  Let me pull up my caller screen here.
[00:05:28.304 --> 00:05:34.268]  Let's go ahead and go back, because he was waiting last hour and he had a question and I had to cut him off because the guest came up.
[00:05:34.648 --> 00:05:40.151]  Joe in the UK, then Mordecai, Mark, Mr. X-Stan, and others.
[00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:43.633]  Okay, Joe in the UK, go ahead and ask your question again.
[00:05:43.653 --> 00:05:45.414]  Yeah, please.
[00:05:45.835 --> 00:05:52.719]  Basically, as I was saying, in view of the human rights in the New World Order, I believe
[00:05:54.054 --> 00:06:13.204]  Ultimately, because the Illuminati, as I understand it, are based on satanic and occult rituals, and part of that whole affair, is that I believe they're making preparations, as is most of the most Christian Muslim religions, to basically await the Antichrist.
[00:06:13.524 --> 00:06:14.845]  And the seat's already been built!
[00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:23.449]  Now, as I read on the web, I mean, basically in Muslim religion, which are very similar in revelation, it's called Qiyamah in the Quran,
[00:06:24.011 --> 00:06:25.812]  The Antichrist called Dajjal.
[00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:31.177]  And ironically, in the Quran it tells that he has one eye.
[00:06:31.317 --> 00:06:36.120]  That's why we see all these buildings with one eye.
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.945]  And that's why he had a degree in occult mythology, was a top scholar.
[00:06:42.105 --> 00:06:42.845]  J.R.R.
[00:06:42.905 --> 00:06:49.350]  Tolkien, you know, the evil god they worship has the one single burning eye and lives at the top of a pyramid-shaped mountain.
[00:06:49.871 --> 00:06:50.291]  Exactly.
[00:06:50.311 --> 00:06:52.453]  They throw these archetypal images in our face.
[00:06:53.217 --> 00:06:59.109]  It appears, it appears, and I want to just go into this, it appears the court get their strength through symbolism.
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:20.607]  Yes, they have a cover of Newsweek just covered with sub-genius type Illuminati symbolism about how Obama is the Supreme Leader being energized worldwide, and there's all this Kabbalic symbolism.
[00:07:21.627 --> 00:07:23.848]  If you know about the Kabbalah, and I'm for President
[00:07:24.008 --> 00:07:37.636]  Yeah, so basically, look, again, Islam and Christianity are very much similar in terms of the Qiyamah and Revelations.
[00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:44.120]  Why our Qur'an says it's like, we reveal the prophet Jesus, because it's symbolic of the Day of the Dead.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.381]  He actually comes back.
[00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:49.163]  We call him Esau in the Qur'an, and he destroys the Antichrist.
[00:07:49.611 --> 00:08:18.011]  Now what I believe is that basically the whole purpose is Illuminati and World Order for centuries has been planning to basically facilitate the return of the Antichrist and the Koran says... No, no, the United Nations admits that they are bringing in a world religious leader and that if you don't you can have whatever religion you want but you've got to worship this one leader and his image which is broadcast for the whole world to see, television, and if you don't you are killed.
[00:08:19.246 --> 00:08:23.189]  Yeah, I mean, what I'm saying is there's method in their madness.
[00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:24.249]  Do you know what I mean?
[00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:26.291]  It's not just for the power for its own sake.
[00:08:26.551 --> 00:08:30.594]  And I believe all this is systematic from the First World War, Second World War.
[00:08:30.974 --> 00:08:34.776]  It's to create the state of Israel, so they have the power over that.
[00:08:35.177 --> 00:08:42.141]  The Qur'an and the Bible both says the Antichrist will appear between Syria and Iraq, effectively Palestine.
[00:08:42.462 --> 00:08:42.662]  Yeah?
[00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:48.486]  So I believe this agenda, this occult, satanic agenda is, you know, it's called to do it.
[00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:54.552]  You know, basically, Istanbul will form a new continental.
[00:08:55.032 --> 00:08:57.454]  In 2015, Turkey joins NATO.
[00:08:58.174 --> 00:08:59.035]  Yeah?
[00:08:59.515 --> 00:09:01.156]  Sir, listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:09:01.216 --> 00:09:01.757]  Great points.
[00:09:02.097 --> 00:09:03.398]  I'm going to move on to other callers.
[00:09:03.458 --> 00:09:04.299]  Everybody has time.
[00:09:04.319 --> 00:09:05.440]  But I want to say this.
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:15.847]  From a secular position, every time I bring up Bohemian Grove, Skull and Bones, our supposed Christian conservative leaders involved in all these rituals, people say, oh, you're just a Christian.
[00:09:15.867 --> 00:09:16.728]  I don't believe in all that.
[00:09:17.421 --> 00:09:32.377]  Well, when the hillside strangler goes out and strangles women and carves a pentagram in his hand and says, you know, hail Satan, and, you know, makes the Diablo sign in court, you know, they don't say to the judge, let's let him go, we don't believe in Satanism.
[00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:36.221]  We say this guy's a psychopathic killer and he's a Satanist.
[00:09:38.834 --> 00:09:44.777]  But again, there's this disconnect with the yuppies and the humanists and the atheists.
[00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:46.998]  They say, well, I don't believe in all of that.
[00:09:47.578 --> 00:09:51.780]  Well, I mean, the world leaders do believe it, even if you don't believe it, even if you think it's all made up.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.361]  They believe they're creating this world Christ.
[00:09:54.421 --> 00:10:02.484]  They believe they're bringing in this world government with the computers, tracking everything you do, and thumb scanning, and face scanning, and national ID cards to buy and sell.
[00:10:04.185 --> 00:10:08.087]  In fact, go to YouTube and Google Joe Biden.
[00:10:10.407 --> 00:10:12.508]  Talks about microchip in the body.
[00:10:13.408 --> 00:10:23.892]  And there he is a few years ago, in testimony, when they're interviewing Justice Toledo, and they say, mark my words, you will rule on the implantable chip.
[00:10:24.572 --> 00:10:27.433]  And in Mexico, if you want to be part of the Attorney General's office, you have to take one.
[00:10:27.933 --> 00:10:32.555]  All over the world, Special Forces troops, including the U.S., many of them are being made to take the chip.
[00:10:33.959 --> 00:10:42.808]  If you want to have a job in the next 10 years in the military, they're saying you're going to have to have brain augmentation with a chip hooked into the AI system to be able to pilot the drones remotely.
[00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:44.310]  This is all being announced.
[00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:45.211]  This is happening.
[00:10:45.531 --> 00:10:46.633]  And so even if you say, well,
[00:10:47.867 --> 00:10:49.349]  It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:10:49.409 --> 00:10:59.562]  The elites, the esoteric people, they saw the Bible and they saw what John on the Isle of Patmos said and what Daniel said and so they're creating it, they're making it.
[00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:02.305]  Regardless, regardless, it's being done.
[00:11:02.886 --> 00:11:05.028]  John actually found the audio of it
[00:11:05.689 --> 00:11:12.873]  Will you IM that to the guys down here, to David down here, so that we can... In fact, they tell me they just simultaneously found it.
[00:11:13.194 --> 00:11:18.057]  Pull it up on screen for folks, and we're going to go ahead and play this clip and then go back to your phone calls.
[00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:19.277]  Well, we've got to go to break.
[00:11:19.297 --> 00:11:27.542]  When we come back, we're going to play the clip and then we're going to continue with the phone calls for everybody that is patiently holding.
[00:11:27.822 --> 00:11:28.443]  So stay with us.
[00:11:28.463 --> 00:11:31.565]  I want to talk to Mordecai and Israel and others when we get back.
[00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:37.035]  But imagine, ten years ago I'd talk about the move to forcibly implant us with chips.
[00:11:37.115 --> 00:11:40.017]  With prisoners and Alzheimer's and babies and the rest of it.
[00:11:40.477 --> 00:11:43.038]  And then now, you know, I was called a kook.
[00:11:43.178 --> 00:11:44.119]  Now it's just mainstream.
[00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:44.999]  They're going, yeah, so what?
[00:11:45.019 --> 00:11:45.819]  You gotta take a chip.
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.120]  That's how we fight Al Qaeda.
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.281]  You prove you're safe.
[00:11:48.761 --> 00:11:52.743]  In fact, I have Andy Rooney saying, you gotta take a chip to prove you're safe on 60 Minutes.
[00:11:54.338 --> 00:11:55.860]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.482]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:11:57.782 --> 00:12:00.024]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:12:00.465 --> 00:12:05.210]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:12:05.611 --> 00:12:08.454]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:12.258]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[00:12:12.685 --> 00:12:24.668]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[00:12:25.228 --> 00:12:27.229]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[00:12:27.249 --> 00:12:28.549]  I use one every day.
[00:12:28.969 --> 00:12:31.410]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.230]  We're good.
[00:12:54.676 --> 00:12:58.340]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:12:58.741 --> 00:13:04.167]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:13:04.628 --> 00:13:05.709]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:13:05.749 --> 00:13:09.794]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:13:10.434 --> 00:13:23.763]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:13:24.244 --> 00:13:29.547]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:13:29.848 --> 00:13:35.732]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:13:36.492 --> 00:13:37.833]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:37.973 --> 00:13:42.535]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:44.116]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:45.916 --> 00:13:49.718]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:13:49.738 --> 00:13:50.158]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:51.499 --> 00:14:00.523]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:14:00.883 --> 00:14:02.544]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:04.559]  But who is the enemy?
[00:14:05.059 --> 00:14:05.560]  Bin Laden.
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:06.860]  This is his ammo.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.160]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.901]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:14:10.221 --> 00:14:16.983]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:14:17.363 --> 00:14:17.803]  Some U.S.
[00:14:17.843 --> 00:14:23.485]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:14:24.205 --> 00:14:27.727]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:14:28.087 --> 00:14:30.509]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:14:54.179 --> 00:14:55.720]  These are strange new days.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.841]  Foreclosures are at record highs.
[00:14:57.961 --> 00:14:59.382]  People are losing their jobs.
[00:14:59.662 --> 00:15:01.643]  The threat of a terrorist attack looms.
[00:15:01.883 --> 00:15:04.065]  Food supplies are at an all-time low.
[00:15:04.245 --> 00:15:06.366]  And now we have a new untested president.
[00:15:06.586 --> 00:15:08.267]  The time of change is upon us.
[00:15:08.367 --> 00:15:13.050]  And to those of you who are in the know, you realize that the most difficult times have yet to be seen.
[00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:14.151]  I think so.
[00:15:34.275 --> 00:15:34.836]  Can butter!
[00:15:35.096 --> 00:15:35.316]  Call 903-356-6443.
[00:15:35.336 --> 00:15:35.957]  That's 903-356-6443 from 9 a.m.
[00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:36.137]  to 6 p.m.
[00:15:36.157 --> 00:15:37.278]  Central Standard Time.
[00:15:37.298 --> 00:15:39.000]  Or shop online at internet-grocer.net.
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.601]  Again, that's internet-grocer.net.
[00:16:04.446 --> 00:16:07.708]  There's a man going around taking names.
[00:16:08.409 --> 00:16:09.449]  Alright, we're back live.
[00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:12.471]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[00:16:14.813 --> 00:16:17.635]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[00:16:19.476 --> 00:16:22.398]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.
[00:16:22.778 --> 00:16:24.580]  Okay, let's go ahead.
[00:16:26.797 --> 00:16:27.719]  And go to this clip.
[00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:30.563]  This is Joe Biden, and then there's a bunch of C-SPAN angles of this.
[00:16:30.583 --> 00:16:40.397]  This is the one where it's on Supreme Court Justice nominee at the time, Alito, and they are
[00:16:41.738 --> 00:16:45.060]  Asking him, you know, you will rule, mark my words, on the implanted chip.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.183]  This is your new vice president, sworn in tomorrow, there with 47,000.
[00:16:49.544 --> 00:16:51.985]  Excuse me, I said 45,000 earlier.
[00:16:52.085 --> 00:16:52.506]  It's 47,000.
[00:16:53.366 --> 00:17:02.373]  More troops and police than are in all of Afghanistan right now, all to protect the emperor, to foster this image that he actually runs something, or that he can save you.
[00:17:02.733 --> 00:17:04.114]  Talk about trying to get folks hyped up.
[00:17:04.634 --> 00:17:05.155]  Here's the clip.
[00:17:05.919 --> 00:17:11.184]  Can a microscopic tag be implanted in a person's body to track his every movement?
[00:17:11.204 --> 00:17:13.065]  There's actual discussion about that.
[00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:14.586]  You will rule on that.
[00:17:14.687 --> 00:17:17.429]  Mark my words before your tenure is over.
[00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:22.553]  And so there is Joe Biden, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:22.733 --> 00:17:24.295]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[00:17:25.195 --> 00:17:27.217]  Let's talk to Mordecai in Israel.
[00:17:27.257 --> 00:17:28.098]  Mordecai, welcome.
[00:17:29.339 --> 00:17:29.940]  Hi, Alex.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:30.800]  Yes, sir.
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:31.401]  Thanks for holding.
[00:17:32.605 --> 00:17:33.665]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[00:17:34.225 --> 00:17:45.029]  Actually, I wanted to talk about something altogether different, but I've been on the phone listening to the clips that you've been playing and your talk with Jerusalem.
[00:17:46.529 --> 00:17:51.171]  I want to tell you something about myself and where I'm coming from so you'll understand what it is that I want to say.
[00:17:51.191 --> 00:17:54.572]  I consider myself a brother truth activist.
[00:17:57.633 --> 00:18:02.334]  I wrote a report several years ago on the acquiescence of the Israeli government
[00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:24.426]  Many of the things that were said in the clips that were played before, I don't agree with and I don't want to go into specifics unless you request it because it would just take too much time.
[00:18:24.446 --> 00:18:27.869]  I know you have many other callers, maybe if there's another opportunity.
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:50.930]  The clip you played from the English Jew, I agree with almost nothing that he said except for one thing that I feel very strongly about, and that's when he mentioned the manipulation of, by the Zionists, of the fact of the Holocaust in order to manipulate Gentiles into guilt, into doing things for Israel.
[00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:57.613]  I'll go further than what he said and mention the very fact of the Zionist complicity
[00:18:58.462 --> 00:19:01.505]  And help in helping the Holocaust to happen.
[00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:02.625]  Well, that's on record.
[00:19:02.665 --> 00:19:07.629]  I mean, that's scholarly publications from universities in the United States.
[00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:15.456]  In fact, they funded Hitler from the beginning and made deals to where Jews weren't allowed to go to England or New York in the United States.
[00:19:15.936 --> 00:19:19.019]  They were blocked by Roosevelt and others, and then he was praised by the Zionists.
[00:19:19.619 --> 00:19:22.822]  And then they had to pay bribes to the Zionists to even be able to go to Israel.
[00:19:23.702 --> 00:19:25.484]  And so, that's just government again.
[00:19:25.544 --> 00:19:26.625]  That's just elites again.
[00:19:27.225 --> 00:19:29.207]  Feeding on their own people in the name of saving them.
[00:19:30.208 --> 00:19:30.968]  Absolutely.
[00:19:31.589 --> 00:19:33.250]  It's a story of the elite.
[00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.192]  It's a story of... Well, you're over in Israel.
[00:19:35.292 --> 00:19:39.215]  Why did Israel get those billions of dollars from the U.S.
[00:19:39.616 --> 00:19:42.458]  to irradiate 110,000 Sephardic Jews?
[00:19:43.219 --> 00:19:44.420]  That's absolutely true.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.962]  That was the next point that I wanted to make.
[00:19:47.242 --> 00:19:49.564]  I wanted to praise you and thank you for bringing up
[00:19:50.382 --> 00:19:55.184]  The fact of the... I don't know if it can be called a genocide.
[00:19:55.784 --> 00:19:58.245]  We know why the United States gave the money.
[00:19:58.285 --> 00:20:01.966]  We know why Israel performed these experiments.
[00:20:02.006 --> 00:20:07.849]  The only thing is that people need to know that it's not just the Israelis against the Sephardic Jews.
[00:20:07.929 --> 00:20:09.969]  It's also the Israelis against the Ashkenazic Jews.
[00:20:09.989 --> 00:20:11.450]  It's the Israelis against all Jews.
[00:20:12.116 --> 00:20:18.279]  There are many, many people and thinking has been so befuddled and clouded on all the issues.
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:26.442]  Like I say... Yes, you have this Illuminati elite that sits above every group playing us all off against each other.
[00:20:27.023 --> 00:20:27.943]  It's absolutely true.
[00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:29.384]  It's absolutely true.
[00:20:29.724 --> 00:20:30.564]  I wanted to say...
[00:20:33.138 --> 00:20:37.640]  Alex, you should know that my wife and I, on all of the issues, we agree.
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:46.423]  I never call talk radio in, I don't know how many years, 25 years, 30 years of political activism.
[00:20:47.603 --> 00:20:52.585]  Your show is the only show that I will call because you're the only one.
[00:20:52.605 --> 00:20:57.687]  Even though I don't agree with everything you say, and I'll tell you why, it's because
[00:20:58.464 --> 00:21:03.107]  Some of the information that you get is from these Israeli newspapers like Haaretz.
[00:21:04.067 --> 00:21:17.775]  And for you to read that newspaper, Haaretz, and think that you know something about me, a Jew living in Israel, would be akin to me reading something in the New York Times and thinking that I understand something about Alex Jones.
[00:21:18.035 --> 00:21:21.637]  Why would Haaretz come out and admit that Israel stages terror attacks?
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.382]  Well, I'd have to see the specific article that you're referring to.
[00:21:27.442 --> 00:21:34.104]  I think that anything that Harvick does is for their own self-serving world order.
[00:21:34.244 --> 00:21:36.625]  Well, listen, call back on another day and we'll spend more time.
[00:21:36.645 --> 00:21:37.346]  Appreciate your call.
[00:21:37.366 --> 00:21:38.366]  Good to hear from you from Israel.
[00:21:38.686 --> 00:21:39.686]  More calls straight ahead.
[00:21:39.706 --> 00:21:43.308]  Stay with us.
[00:21:44.368 --> 00:21:45.289]  We're on the march.
[00:21:45.769 --> 00:21:47.369]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:51.011]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:54.614 --> 00:21:57.997]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:21:58.137 --> 00:22:03.362]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:22:03.542 --> 00:22:08.306]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:22:08.687 --> 00:22:19.817]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:22:20.197 --> 00:22:25.759]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:22:25.979 --> 00:22:32.040]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:32.901]  What about you?
[00:22:33.281 --> 00:22:39.322]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for our special price of only $39.99, with free shipping.
[00:22:39.723 --> 00:22:41.843]  Call the Berkey guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.
[00:22:45.219 --> 00:22:46.520]  That's 1-877-886-3653.

[00:22:53.943 --> 00:22:56.004]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:22:56.124 --> 00:22:58.505]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:22:58.525 --> 00:23:01.146]  9-11 was an inside job!
[00:23:01.166 --> 00:23:02.327]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:23:02.347 --> 00:23:03.987]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:23:04.067 --> 00:23:06.909]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:23:06.949 --> 00:23:10.590]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:23:20.258 --> 00:23:25.134]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:23:28.897 --> 00:23:29.997]  How dare you?
[00:23:31.338 --> 00:23:36.399]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:23:36.559 --> 00:23:39.059]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:23:39.119 --> 00:23:45.500]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.361]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:23:48.621 --> 00:23:50.601]  Or get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:23:50.881 --> 00:23:53.342]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:23:54.091 --> 00:23:58.373]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:23:58.613 --> 00:24:03.516]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:24:03.716 --> 00:24:05.017]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:24:05.217 --> 00:24:08.699]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[00:24:08.819 --> 00:24:13.982]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[00:24:14.242 --> 00:24:20.005]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[00:24:20.345 --> 00:24:22.746]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[00:24:22.846 --> 00:24:25.167]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[00:24:25.387 --> 00:24:27.508]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair and more.
[00:24:27.808 --> 00:24:28.768]  No harsh chemicals.
[00:24:29.008 --> 00:24:29.949]  No animal testing.
[00:24:30.189 --> 00:24:31.509]  I use them and love them.
[00:24:31.529 --> 00:24:33.130]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:34.471]  And I save big time.
[00:24:34.831 --> 00:24:36.051]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:24:36.071 --> 00:24:36.271]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[00:24:36.311 --> 00:24:37.992]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[00:24:46.315 --> 00:24:48.980]  Again, that number 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:11.642]  We will cover the ridiculous coronation of the new puppet-in-chief, Barack Hussein Obama, who the establishment is casting as the role of savior.
[00:25:12.602 --> 00:25:27.125]  If you just turn off your thinking cap, do everything he says, the youth brigades, the troops, the government jobs, the foreign banks openly subdividing all of our infrastructure, the Napa superhighways,
[00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:30.670]  They will save you.
[00:25:32.051 --> 00:25:37.918]  I want to comment briefly on one thing Malachi was saying, and we're going to go back to Mark, Mr. X, Stan, Charles, and others quickly here.
[00:25:38.318 --> 00:25:40.100]  These callers all bring up such key issues, though.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.142]  How do you not respond to them in some detail?
[00:25:43.484 --> 00:25:46.728]  And that issue is that
[00:25:49.969 --> 00:26:03.158]  Everything is so nuanced and complex, and you have to have the historical background, and you have to have the modern context, and then try to explain any of it is very hard to do because it oversimplifies.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:11.543]  But when I get on air and I say, when you get to the highest levels of the New World Order, you find three things.
[00:26:11.603 --> 00:26:13.284]  You find Nazi occultist.
[00:26:16.006 --> 00:26:18.067]  You find Zionist occultist.
[00:26:19.286 --> 00:26:24.531]  And then you find a group even above that, kind of this Luciferian occult group.
[00:26:25.232 --> 00:26:26.393]  People make jokes out of that.
[00:26:26.633 --> 00:26:27.894]  Oh, the German death cult.
[00:26:28.315 --> 00:26:29.636]  Well, I mean, what is Skull and Bones?
[00:26:29.676 --> 00:26:30.697]  What is Bohemian Grove?
[00:26:31.963 --> 00:26:33.724]  What is the Israeli Supreme Court building?
[00:26:33.764 --> 00:26:35.745]  What are all these obelisks and all this occultism?
[00:26:35.785 --> 00:26:36.706]  I mean, we've gone over that.
[00:26:36.746 --> 00:26:37.507]  We know what it is.
[00:26:38.547 --> 00:26:39.908]  It is the Babylon Mystery School.
[00:26:39.928 --> 00:26:48.033]  I mean, I remember ten years ago getting on air with guests and saying Madonna was doing Kabbalic rituals in front of everyone at her concerts, and for five years she's been admitting it.
[00:26:48.434 --> 00:26:49.174]  Three years or so.
[00:26:53.197 --> 00:26:56.019]  Why are they obsessed with symbols and numerology and all of this?
[00:26:56.959 --> 00:27:01.102]  And then I criticize Israel for sneak attacking the USS Liberty to try to sink it, to blame it on
[00:27:03.081 --> 00:27:04.641]  Egypt is a pretext to widen the war in 67.
[00:27:04.821 --> 00:27:06.542]  The Six Day War.
[00:27:08.322 --> 00:27:09.603]  Right out of Operation Northwoods.
[00:27:10.203 --> 00:27:11.723]  And then they're 100% culpable.
[00:27:13.304 --> 00:27:19.405]  But then I mentioned that the White House was involved, parked the ship there, wouldn't let the ship have aid, was clearly involved with Israel doing it.
[00:27:19.425 --> 00:27:20.986]  People say, oh, you're defending Israel, saying the U.S.
[00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:21.206]  did it.
[00:27:21.826 --> 00:27:23.966]  That's a psych warfare operation, folks.
[00:27:24.406 --> 00:27:25.707]  That's mental illness.
[00:27:26.207 --> 00:27:28.287]  That's intellectual dishonesty.
[00:27:28.787 --> 00:27:30.368]  That'd be like if two guys rob a bank,
[00:27:30.928 --> 00:27:32.709]  And I say these two guys robbed a bank.
[00:27:32.809 --> 00:27:34.170]  One guy's black, one guy's white.
[00:27:34.451 --> 00:27:37.293]  You say, oh look at you being a racist against blacks.
[00:27:37.353 --> 00:27:38.654]  Or look at you being a racist against whites.
[00:27:39.134 --> 00:27:42.316]  Or you're saying the white guy's guilty and the black guy isn't guilty.
[00:27:42.336 --> 00:27:42.656]  No I'm not.
[00:27:42.676 --> 00:27:44.518]  I just said two guys robbed a bank.
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.101]  But see how intellectually dishonest that is.
[00:27:49.221 --> 00:27:51.163]  Or then I make a film like Endgame and I show
[00:27:52.416 --> 00:27:57.559]  20 or 30, I don't know, 25 or so examples in the film, in just one little 20 minute segment, of eugenics.
[00:27:57.619 --> 00:27:58.219]  Killing U.S.
[00:27:58.259 --> 00:27:59.120]  troops, our own government.
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:00.621]  Nerve gassing them in tests.
[00:28:02.762 --> 00:28:04.023]  Israel being paid by the U.S.
[00:28:04.043 --> 00:28:08.685]  government to radiate and kill many of the 110,000 Sephardic Jewish children.
[00:28:09.706 --> 00:28:12.027]  People say, oh, look at you trying to make people feel sorry for Israel.
[00:28:12.587 --> 00:28:13.488]  That's not what I'm doing.
[00:28:15.041 --> 00:28:28.347]  I mean, I'm showing how evil the people are that run Israel, that they would do that to their own children, but I show how every government is doing that, because this is the religion of the New World Order, is killing and hurting innocents.
[00:28:30.127 --> 00:28:32.048]  These are sacrifices they're carrying out.
[00:28:32.068 --> 00:28:41.572]  Look at NASA, how they only launch on certain meridian lines and certain dates, and they admit it's all occultic with the trappings and the mission names, and it's all Masonic.
[00:28:44.178 --> 00:28:47.761]  Look at how the military symbols and the Congressional Medal of Honor is a pentagram.
[00:28:48.082 --> 00:28:50.204]  I mean, all of this.
[00:28:50.584 --> 00:28:56.589]  Our society is inculcated with all of this.
[00:28:56.769 --> 00:29:04.737]  And so, the caller calls in and he brings up the fact that the Zionists literally funded Hitler.
[00:29:06.069 --> 00:29:07.250]  Well, that's declassified.
[00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:17.316]  The Milner Group, Lord Milner with Rothschild funding, before Hitler was even on the scene, said, we're going to build up Germany, put a demagogue in, have him wreck Europe, then we'll go in and save the day and set up the world government.
[00:29:18.317 --> 00:29:19.737]  Out of that, they got the United Nations.
[00:29:20.138 --> 00:29:22.099]  They create the crises, offer the solution.
[00:29:24.861 --> 00:29:32.865]  So, it's not defending Israel to point out that Israel worked with Hitler.
[00:29:34.266 --> 00:29:35.227]  And that's on record.
[00:29:38.988 --> 00:29:42.170]  It's stating the facts and saying, well, what do we make of this?
[00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.111]  What do we do with this information?
[00:29:45.411 --> 00:29:47.012]  Who is the real group in control?
[00:29:47.092 --> 00:29:48.172]  What is going on here?
[00:29:49.073 --> 00:29:58.977]  And at the end of the day, the issue is, I don't hate Jews.
[00:30:00.938 --> 00:30:02.519]  And I don't hate Palestinians.
[00:30:02.599 --> 00:30:03.940]  And I don't hate black people.
[00:30:04.747 --> 00:30:09.050]  And I don't hate Arabs, and I don't hate Chinese, and I don't hate Russians.
[00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:16.274]  I don't like the evil Russian leadership over the last hundred years, ninety-something years, funded by the globalists, the bankers.
[00:30:16.695 --> 00:30:18.396]  I don't like the Hitlerian system.
[00:30:18.816 --> 00:30:20.837]  I don't like what our government's doing.
[00:30:20.877 --> 00:30:21.858]  It's an illegitimate government.
[00:30:21.878 --> 00:30:27.902]  You know, I'm seeing there's evil people team up together to take over governments, and they always use tribalism and religion
[00:30:29.355 --> 00:30:35.381]  To manipulate their own subgroup who will fight and die for them, whether it's Arabs or Jews or Israelis or anybody.
[00:30:37.323 --> 00:30:39.765]  When in the end, the greatest abuses are meted out.
[00:30:39.825 --> 00:30:44.269]  I mean, Hitler at the end of the war said, I hate the German people and they deserve to die and they're not good and I'm glad they're dying.
[00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:52.357]  And go ahead and, when he's in the bunker, flood the underground subway system, you know, flood the underground tunnels that everybody's in, kill them all, they deserve to die.
[00:30:53.798 --> 00:30:54.459]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:30:54.479 --> 00:30:56.019]  This is sophisticated.
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:57.480]  This is nuanced.
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:02.703]  It is an indictment of the Zionist regime in Israel to come out and show how they kill their own people.
[00:31:03.504 --> 00:31:06.886]  And to come out and show how they work with Hitler and wouldn't let Jews flee other parts of the world.
[00:31:07.146 --> 00:31:18.673]  Or how, on record, how the Zionists would bomb Jews in Spain and in Iraq and in Iran and drive them out of places they've been for thousands of years to make them come to Israel.
[00:31:20.649 --> 00:31:21.269]  Why is that?
[00:31:21.329 --> 00:31:22.489]  Why do they want them all there?
[00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:23.770]  It's so they can be killed.
[00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:29.731]  It's so they can be played off as genocidal pawns against their neighbors.
[00:31:29.751 --> 00:31:33.252]  And that's what Albert Pike wrote about in 1879.
[00:31:34.793 --> 00:31:37.593]  The three world wars they would engineer.
[00:31:37.633 --> 00:31:38.373]  Everything they would do.
[00:31:38.794 --> 00:31:40.354]  And it's happening.
[00:31:41.294 --> 00:31:58.845]  And so see, if we as a people, Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, whatever, liberals, conservatives, old, young, black, white, doesn't matter, say we don't want foreign banks seizing our roads and jacking up the prices and raping us when they engineered the financial crisis to begin with.
[00:31:58.885 --> 00:32:01.987]  They engineer it, they get the bailouts, and we've got to pay interest on the money we give them.
[00:32:03.962 --> 00:32:05.844]  Somebody goes, oh, you just like the Jews!
[00:32:05.864 --> 00:32:22.101]  I'm like, what does that have to do with the issue of no to the North American superhighways, no to foreigners seizing up all our infrastructure and national parks, no to the animal ID, the premises ID, no to all this regulation and control and CPS grabbing over a million children a year, and the phony drug war?
[00:32:22.621 --> 00:32:24.003]  Ah, shut up, you're government disinfo!
[00:32:24.983 --> 00:32:33.418]  No, government disinfo gets us to all fight with each other and argue over this or that or this instead of let's say no to world government, let's say no to centralization.
[00:32:34.642 --> 00:32:37.443]  Let's say no to everything the global engineers are for.
[00:32:37.503 --> 00:32:38.543]  They're for collectivism.
[00:32:38.583 --> 00:32:39.664]  They're for open borders.
[00:32:40.484 --> 00:32:41.464]  They're for surveillance.
[00:32:41.504 --> 00:32:42.525]  They're for regulation.
[00:32:42.545 --> 00:32:43.645]  They're for centralization.
[00:32:43.665 --> 00:32:44.806]  They're for regionalization.
[00:32:44.826 --> 00:32:46.186]  They're for the FEMA 10 regions.
[00:32:46.566 --> 00:32:47.707]  They're for the CPS.
[00:32:47.767 --> 00:32:50.428]  They're for getting everybody institutionalized.
[00:32:50.448 --> 00:32:52.828]  They're for drugging the population with Ritalin and Prozac.
[00:32:53.109 --> 00:32:55.970]  Now over 100 million prescriptions a year for Prozac alone in the U.S.
[00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.130]  They are for drugging us to control us.
[00:32:58.170 --> 00:32:59.331]  They want to break up our families.
[00:32:59.531 --> 00:33:01.111]  They state in their own policy reports.
[00:33:01.151 --> 00:33:02.292]  We've shown you and covered here.
[00:33:03.052 --> 00:33:03.833]  That's the issue.
[00:33:04.373 --> 00:33:05.474]  We're against the policies.
[00:33:05.514 --> 00:33:06.454]  We're against the ideas.
[00:33:06.694 --> 00:33:07.715]  We're against these wars.
[00:33:07.995 --> 00:33:10.417]  We're against gun control, victim disarmament.
[00:33:11.177 --> 00:33:15.680]  I am against everything the New World Order is for, which is all against the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.641]  I'm for the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:33:17.941 --> 00:33:18.601]  They're against it.
[00:33:18.822 --> 00:33:20.523]  Therefore, I'm against them on all issues.
[00:33:21.283 --> 00:33:35.368]  And they want to sidetrack you from waking people up about government-sponsored terror, and waking people up about GMO foods and how deadly they are, and waking people up about the fact there's no law you gotta take vaccines, or the media saying homeschooling's illegal when there's millions of homeschoolers, and it's not illegal.
[00:33:35.388 --> 00:33:36.608]  All these hoaxes they run.
[00:33:37.108 --> 00:33:46.651]  Instead of us coming together on real concrete things that we, in every poll, 90, 95, 99% of people don't want the North American Union.
[00:33:46.711 --> 00:33:48.052]  So we should come together and say no.
[00:33:49.804 --> 00:33:52.908]  98% of Texans don't want the Trans-Texas-NAFTA Highway.
[00:33:53.569 --> 00:33:57.335]  So they claim they're getting rid of it, but then they say, oh, we're actually breaking it up into multi-parts.
[00:33:58.176 --> 00:34:00.019]  So we come back and we fight them on that deception.
[00:34:00.079 --> 00:34:00.700]  We sue them.
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:01.421]  We remove them.
[00:34:01.461 --> 00:34:02.182]  We expose them.
[00:34:03.704 --> 00:34:04.686]  We remove them from office.
[00:34:06.223 --> 00:34:10.564]  We know the electronic voting machines are fraud ridden and stealing elections, so we expose those.
[00:34:11.004 --> 00:34:14.505]  We have petitions signed for a paper ballot vote to remove them.
[00:34:14.925 --> 00:34:16.086]  We get aggressive.
[00:34:16.146 --> 00:34:20.107]  We go out and we say no to the Patriot Act, no to the police state, no to secret arrests.
[00:34:20.147 --> 00:34:23.588]  We point out how the public's being conditioned to accept troops on the streets of America.
[00:34:25.788 --> 00:34:32.370]  Another example of this groupism and how they use tribalism, balkanization to divide and conquer us is Obama.
[00:34:33.502 --> 00:34:44.468]  All over Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, on the comments under the stories, people come in, and most of them are probably shills, and they'll say, you just don't like Obama because you don't like black people.
[00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:55.815]  No, I'm against forced conscription and a new national draft for the military, 18 to 24, on record, on the Obama website, and from his chief of staff.
[00:34:58.254 --> 00:35:00.755]  No, I am against open borders.
[00:35:01.115 --> 00:35:02.075]  Because the globalists are for it.
[00:35:02.215 --> 00:35:03.196]  And then we can go through the reasons.
[00:35:03.236 --> 00:35:08.858]  Deindustrialization, bankrupting the states, welfare systems and medical systems so the feds have to come in.
[00:35:09.338 --> 00:35:12.519]  Again, they wreck everything so they can then come in as the saviors.
[00:35:12.999 --> 00:35:14.840]  That's the system they use over and over again.
[00:35:19.881 --> 00:35:22.682]  It's just so utterly mindless, what's going on.
[00:35:22.702 --> 00:35:27.784]  You know, all the liberals want to prove that they like black people and aren't racist because they have all this guilt the media has taught them.
[00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:39.395]  And so then, they all pile on and go, I don't care what Obama says or does, I love him because I've proven I voted for him, and I've proven that I'm not racist.
[00:35:39.835 --> 00:35:53.042]  And then black folks are like, man, he's a brother from another mother, and this is such a great thing, and it gives us this pride, and there's that real pride there, and you wish it could be something good, but it's a lie and a fraud!
[00:35:53.362 --> 00:35:57.885]  The first thing he says he's gonna do is double the funding for forced abortions in China!
[00:35:59.898 --> 00:36:07.242]  And that's not Alex Jones, the Huffington Post of all places came out with an article two weeks ago and admitted eugenics and admitted the UN's doing it.
[00:36:07.862 --> 00:36:12.785]  And meanwhile Pat Robertson saying China's forced abortions and infanticide is what they've got to do.
[00:36:13.025 --> 00:36:15.827]  And then you've got the liberals over here saying it's bad.
[00:36:17.267 --> 00:36:23.911]  I mean, I'm now anti-black because I don't want people being sterilized or forced abortions in Africa.
[00:36:24.291 --> 00:36:27.273]  Or I'm anti-Chinese because I don't want dead Chinese babies.
[00:36:28.462 --> 00:36:29.102]  How does that work?
[00:36:29.422 --> 00:36:31.063]  See, but it's all like, hey, I'm black.
[00:36:31.103 --> 00:36:32.304]  He says, look, I'm black.
[00:36:32.504 --> 00:36:33.624]  The media says, look, he's black.
[00:36:33.684 --> 00:36:34.364]  It's change.
[00:36:36.906 --> 00:36:37.606]  There's no change.
[00:36:38.666 --> 00:36:45.309]  You know, a black cop can beat you down, whether you're black or white, and take you to a prison cell and claim you attacked him and set you up if it wasn't on camera.
[00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:54.413]  Just as much as a white cop can shoot a black guy right in the back and then hope nobody got video of it and confiscate the video and try to lie about it and then he got caught.
[00:36:55.509 --> 00:36:57.931]  Tyranny can come on under any skin color.
[00:36:58.692 --> 00:37:01.234]  And let me tell you something, folks, it's coming under Barack Obama.
[00:37:01.514 --> 00:37:03.135]  Alright, let's accelerate through your calls.
[00:37:03.436 --> 00:37:04.677]  Mark in Oregon, you're on the air.
[00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:08.300]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:37:09.481 --> 00:37:12.423]  And welcome back, and it's great to have you back.
[00:37:13.204 --> 00:37:13.744]  Thank you, sir.
[00:37:14.705 --> 00:37:17.067]  Alex, I hope you had a great vacation.
[00:37:17.107 --> 00:37:21.010]  You sound like you have as much energy or more than you've ever had, if that's possible.
[00:37:21.511 --> 00:37:22.652]  It rusted my voice.
[00:37:24.835 --> 00:37:31.817]  Well, I think it rejuvenated you maybe a little bit, you know, from all this hard work you've been doing for the last 13 years or so.
[00:37:32.677 --> 00:37:43.320]  Actually, Alex, I wanted to make a quick comment just on what the British gentleman had mentioned in his call, and then I had two quick pieces of factual information to pass on to you.
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:53.423]  The British gentleman was talking about the whole goal, if I understood him correctly, of the Illuminati agenda and its current stage
[00:37:54.068 --> 00:38:09.468]  Last stage of its known agenda, as most, all of us even lower level Illuminists are aware of, to bring the world into this consolidated one world government, is actually the same as saying they're bringing in the rule of the Antichrist, as far as their view of it goes.
[00:38:09.588 --> 00:38:11.671]  Why do you say us low level Illuminists?
[00:38:12.879 --> 00:38:20.361]  Well, I think their lower-level workers aren't privy to actually... But why did you say, you said as if we were their workers?
[00:38:20.541 --> 00:38:22.322]  Oh, no, no, I didn't mean that.
[00:38:22.502 --> 00:38:31.264]  Well, no, actually, they consider, when you talk to a Luminist, they consider those of us that are awake as on the light side of the Luminist.
[00:38:31.284 --> 00:38:32.845]  See, that's how they claim they control it all.
[00:38:33.245 --> 00:38:34.985]  And it's this balance between light and dark.
[00:38:35.025 --> 00:38:35.866]  It's funny you said that.
[00:38:38.064 --> 00:38:42.128]  I say no to that title, but they say, don't you know you're part of the Illuminati too?
[00:38:42.509 --> 00:38:43.750]  You're just on a different path.
[00:38:45.451 --> 00:38:47.413]  And they believe in all this weird balance.
[00:38:47.433 --> 00:38:48.915]  They kill a million kids, it's beautiful.
[00:38:49.696 --> 00:38:51.558]  Save a million kids, it's beautiful.
[00:38:52.819 --> 00:39:01.708]  They claim that anybody that's actually aware and knows what's going on in the universe and who wants to know and who is into knowledge, which they say is the real wealth, they claim that you're an Illuminist.
[00:39:02.509 --> 00:39:08.312]  Well, I wouldn't consider myself to be an Illuminist unless I believed on Lucifer as Almighty God of Creation.
[00:39:08.792 --> 00:39:09.272]  Exactly.
[00:39:09.452 --> 00:39:10.013]  Like they do.
[00:39:10.213 --> 00:39:11.834]  In fact, pull up that Mason.
[00:39:12.114 --> 00:39:14.595]  I want to play that video on screen.
[00:39:14.975 --> 00:39:16.376]  Mason says he loves Lucifer.
[00:39:16.476 --> 00:39:17.236]  Pull that up on YouTube.
[00:39:17.256 --> 00:39:17.896]  We're going to play that.
[00:39:17.916 --> 00:39:18.217]  Go ahead.
[00:39:19.057 --> 00:39:27.121]  But it certainly does give, I think, a very accurate picture of what the end or the goal of the endgame stage here is, and that is
[00:39:27.517 --> 00:39:32.701]  Just to bring in the Antichrist, to put it in the most succinct word formation possible.
[00:39:32.781 --> 00:39:35.224]  And any way you cut it, even if you're an atheist, it doesn't matter.
[00:39:35.264 --> 00:39:46.894]  The world leaders believe in the Kabbalah, the Babylon-Mitchell religions, the occult, Luciferianism, that's their main religion, it's on record, they're on record, and they are manifesting it.
[00:39:46.974 --> 00:39:52.118]  So even if you don't believe it's really real, they are manifesting it and making it real through their actions.
[00:39:52.178 --> 00:39:52.999]  I appreciate your call.
[00:39:55.646 --> 00:39:57.527]  Mr. X in Texas, thanks for holding.
[00:40:00.047 --> 00:40:00.327]  Hello?
[00:40:00.767 --> 00:40:01.728]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:40:01.748 --> 00:40:04.948]  If I could just have a couple minutes of your time.
[00:40:05.489 --> 00:40:08.289]  Thank you for having me.
[00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:12.750]  I know I sound young, I'm 26.
[00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:15.031]  I'm risking my life coming forward.
[00:40:17.251 --> 00:40:22.513]  I was given the CIA operative code name Mastermind in August of 06.
[00:40:24.336 --> 00:40:32.962]  The same mastermind Bush got on the air and said foiled a supposed terror plot on Dallas, which is a complete lie and a farce.
[00:40:33.522 --> 00:40:34.302]  I am a psychic.
[00:40:36.364 --> 00:40:41.727]  I did not know I was a psychic until they began spying on me and following me.
[00:40:43.949 --> 00:40:44.709]  Let me say this, sir.
[00:40:45.089 --> 00:40:46.510]  Send me your story in an email.
[00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:51.994]  A lot of folks that think this has happened have a chemical imbalance.
[00:40:53.257 --> 00:40:55.138]  And a lot of that's been artificially done.
[00:40:55.518 --> 00:40:58.239]  The public through TV, the culture is under mind control itself.
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:10.244]  But normally these grandiose things where one person is doing all this incredible stuff is a manifestation of the sick society itself.
[00:41:10.825 --> 00:41:13.186]  Okay, Stan in Missouri, you're on the air.
[00:41:15.487 --> 00:41:16.127]  Hello Alex.
[00:41:16.707 --> 00:41:17.127]  Hey!
[00:41:17.768 --> 00:41:20.909]  I guess you probably heard that they're talking about bringing back the
[00:41:21.502 --> 00:41:24.863]  Banning the old cars off the road at 10 years old or older.
[00:41:24.883 --> 00:41:26.743]  A friend of mine heard about this on CNN.
[00:41:27.043 --> 00:41:27.223]  Yep.
[00:41:27.764 --> 00:41:28.604]  And everything.
[00:41:28.664 --> 00:41:33.165]  Look, they're going to tax cows, sheep, your farms, your house, putting in new windows.
[00:41:33.345 --> 00:41:36.086]  Everything you do is going to be micromanaged.
[00:41:36.226 --> 00:41:37.986]  Everything you do is going to be controlled.
[00:41:38.966 --> 00:41:39.246]  Yes.
[00:41:39.347 --> 00:41:42.607]  A friend of mine told a couple of females about this.
[00:41:42.707 --> 00:41:47.889]  And one of them lives in her sales work, or well, she lives in Coal Camp, Missouri and works at Walmart.
[00:41:47.929 --> 00:41:49.029]  She said, well,
[00:41:49.591 --> 00:41:52.693]  They go take my old 89 car, they're going to have to kill me.
[00:41:52.893 --> 00:41:56.776]  Well, millions and millions of people, Alex, as you well know, own older model cars.
[00:41:57.877 --> 00:41:59.198]  And the cops are going to harass you?
[00:41:59.558 --> 00:42:05.323]  Yes, we know what's going to happen when you go down there to register your car and say, sorry, sir, we can't give you no license.
[00:42:06.063 --> 00:42:13.949]  But, I tell you... And they'll tell you, it's a, it's a, it's a... Well, they'll tell you... Alex, like most of the people... They'll tell you... Hey, Stan, hold on just a second.
[00:42:13.969 --> 00:42:16.791]  They'll tell you it's a privilege to drive that car when it's not, but go ahead.
[00:42:17.179 --> 00:42:18.800]  Yeah, this girl's living in denial.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.946]  All her main concern is is just going out here and buying her high-definition TV and buying Walker's Texas Rangers.
[00:42:26.587 --> 00:42:30.930]  She'd had high hopes for a teenage daughter to go to a university in Kansas City.
[00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:38.757]  Well, she met up with a shipless guy, got pregnant, living in a trailer with no running water or anything like that.
[00:42:38.837 --> 00:42:39.897]  Now she's moving her
[00:42:41.095 --> 00:42:42.796]  What will happen when the grocery stores are empty?
[00:42:42.816 --> 00:42:44.596]  What are you going to do once your food is gone?
[00:43:01.385 --> 00:43:05.207]  What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?
[00:43:05.628 --> 00:43:10.611]  Growing your own food is the only way to have real self-sufficiency and peace of mind.
[00:43:11.031 --> 00:43:18.876]  GetSeeds.net is offering an amazing special on 100 different varieties of heirloom vegetable seeds with a complete range of crops.

[00:43:54.308 --> 00:44:00.593]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:44:00.953 --> 00:44:02.715]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:03.567 --> 00:44:04.588]  But who is the enemy?
[00:44:05.128 --> 00:44:05.629]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:05.909 --> 00:44:06.910]  This is his M.O.
[00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:08.211]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:08.291 --> 00:44:09.933]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:10.273 --> 00:44:17.039]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:17.439 --> 00:44:17.880]  Some U.S.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:23.565]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:24.245 --> 00:44:27.748]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:27.768 --> 00:44:29.909]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:01.223]  Are you one of the millions of people who make New Year's resolutions?
[00:45:01.483 --> 00:45:05.066]  Are you also one of the millions who wind up breaking those resolutions?
[00:45:05.306 --> 00:45:08.389]  How would you like to keep at least one of those resolutions this year?
[00:45:08.549 --> 00:45:11.532]  Well, right now, success is one click away.
[00:45:11.692 --> 00:45:15.356]  Let this be the year you are going to protect yourself year-round.
[00:45:15.596 --> 00:45:20.801]  Pepperspray.com can help keep you safe by offering you the largest assortment of pepper spray.
[00:45:20.981 --> 00:45:21.201]  I think so.
[00:45:39.887 --> 00:45:40.528]  We're good to go.
[00:45:58.468 --> 00:45:59.930]  I think so.
[00:46:18.149 --> 00:46:21.150]  Okay, we're going to go back to Farmer Stan and more of your calls here in just a moment.
[00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:29.671]  I'm going to do a big analysis breakdown on Obama, where we're going, what this big distraction means, the big coronation tomorrow.
[00:46:31.591 --> 00:46:45.774]  Before I do that, here is a Mason, and he's got his Shriner's hat, and he's saying, I'm Lucifer, I'm beautiful, I'm virtuous, I'm good, and that Lucifer's God.
[00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:52.232]  Because they teach at the higher levels that Lucifer and Jesus are one and the same.
[00:46:53.753 --> 00:46:58.175]  And low-level masons who aren't ready for this to be revealed, they're like, oh, no, no, no.
[00:46:58.195 --> 00:47:01.277]  But after decades in there, then they're ready to have it revealed.
[00:47:01.317 --> 00:47:02.518]  That's when it's revealed to them.
[00:47:03.843 --> 00:47:05.505]  So folks will say, oh, this guy's just joking.
[00:47:05.946 --> 00:47:07.508]  No, it's in the main Masonic books.
[00:47:08.228 --> 00:47:10.151]  Manly P. Hall, Albert Pike, all of them.
[00:47:10.972 --> 00:47:12.273]  People who are Masons don't know this.
[00:47:12.314 --> 00:47:13.415]  Just go buy your own books.
[00:47:13.475 --> 00:47:14.436]  I mean, go read them.
[00:47:14.456 --> 00:47:15.818]  I'm sure they're at the Lodge for you.
[00:47:16.919 --> 00:47:17.840]  But here he is.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.562]  Here's the video for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:47:19.582 --> 00:47:21.965]  For everybody else on the radio, here is the audio.
[00:47:22.554 --> 00:47:24.175]  Lucifer, what is your problem?
[00:47:24.475 --> 00:47:25.176]  Just that, sir.
[00:47:25.196 --> 00:47:26.236]  Okay.
[00:47:26.537 --> 00:47:27.377]  I'm a Christian, sir.
[00:47:27.998 --> 00:47:30.439]  I'm pure and virtuous and wholesome and innocent.
[00:47:30.919 --> 00:47:33.001]  How can you say anything about it about me?
[00:47:33.341 --> 00:47:34.542]  Sir, you need to be born again.
[00:47:34.562 --> 00:47:36.103]  I am born again.
[00:47:36.463 --> 00:47:37.884]  Did you just say that you're Lucifer?
[00:47:38.344 --> 00:47:39.065]  I am Lucifer.
[00:47:39.085 --> 00:47:40.386]  Okay, define Lucifer for me.
[00:47:40.826 --> 00:47:45.269]  Pure, virtuous, wholesome, innocent individual that's out to help people.
[00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:46.250]  Lucifer is?
[00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:47.130]  Yeah.
[00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.931]  Say that again.
[00:47:48.051 --> 00:47:51.133]  Lucifer is a pure, holy... Virtuous!
[00:47:51.354 --> 00:47:52.094]  Virtuous.
[00:47:52.314 --> 00:47:53.976]  Now, see the Lucifer that God created?
[00:47:54.416 --> 00:47:55.136]  That's the same one.
[00:47:55.297 --> 00:47:56.157]  Oh, man, this is great.
[00:47:56.177 --> 00:47:57.378]  I'm going to put this on the internet.
[00:47:57.758 --> 00:47:58.119]  Amen.
[00:47:58.139 --> 00:47:59.580]  Oh, God bless you, brother.
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:04.644]  Because that's exactly what the Shriners and Masons teach, is that Lucifer... Lucifer is light.
[00:48:04.984 --> 00:48:05.184]  No.
[00:48:05.605 --> 00:48:06.185]  And you're confirming it.
[00:48:06.205 --> 00:48:07.086]  What about those hospitals?
[00:48:07.706 --> 00:48:08.848]  You know what, sir?
[00:48:09.348 --> 00:48:14.114]  Jesus said, many will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, we did not do these good deeds in your name.
[00:48:14.354 --> 00:48:16.456]  And you'll say, away from me, you workers of iniquity.
[00:48:16.657 --> 00:48:17.377]  I never knew you.
[00:48:18.939 --> 00:48:20.020]  Jesus said it?
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:20.721]  In Matthew chapter 5.
[00:48:23.007 --> 00:48:23.467]  Mercy.
[00:48:23.988 --> 00:48:24.188]  No.
[00:48:24.448 --> 00:48:25.309]  That's hard to believe.
[00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:27.630]  So, you're a Christian and you don't know that.
[00:48:28.291 --> 00:48:30.052]  No, I really am.
[00:48:30.533 --> 00:48:30.753]  You are.
[00:48:30.813 --> 00:48:32.174]  Because I'm pure and virtuous.
[00:48:32.354 --> 00:48:34.275]  You're pure and virtuous, okay.
[00:48:34.355 --> 00:48:36.837]  In other words, you're perfect without Jesus, right?
[00:48:36.977 --> 00:48:37.938]  No, no, no.
[00:48:38.278 --> 00:48:39.439]  Okay, tell me about Jesus.
[00:48:39.459 --> 00:48:40.179]  Who is Jesus?
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:42.601]  He's my leader.
[00:48:42.781 --> 00:48:43.782]  Is He the Son of God?
[00:48:44.022 --> 00:48:44.382]  Yes, He is.
[00:48:44.442 --> 00:48:46.184]  Is He the only worshipful Master?
[00:48:47.093 --> 00:48:47.353]  Yes.
[00:48:47.593 --> 00:48:49.474]  Have you ever been called Worshipful Master?
[00:48:49.795 --> 00:48:51.976]  No, because I've just been too busy.
[00:48:52.036 --> 00:48:52.716]  I've been working.
[00:48:53.057 --> 00:48:53.417]  Working?
[00:48:53.457 --> 00:48:54.538]  Working to help people.
[00:48:54.798 --> 00:48:55.478]  What kind of work?
[00:48:55.698 --> 00:48:58.000]  Get out of here.
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:03.883]  See, this is what a Mason confesses, is that Lucifer is light.
[00:49:07.964 --> 00:49:09.746]  Okay, back to Farmer Stan.
[00:49:11.347 --> 00:49:15.511]  You know, not just restricting and taxing and shutting down the automobiles, but taxes on beef.
[00:49:15.591 --> 00:49:22.278]  Not just a tax on having a cow, and then selling it taxes when you eat beef, because that's a high carbon footprint item.
[00:49:22.318 --> 00:49:28.964]  A lot of carbon went into feeding that cow, and then it's flatulence, the methane and the carbon dioxide, it exhales as a toxic waste.
[00:49:29.364 --> 00:49:32.447]  This is a literal tax on the carbon cycle.
[00:49:33.348 --> 00:49:37.671]  In fact, guys, Google carbon cycle for me and pull up an encyclopedia.
[00:49:37.931 --> 00:49:39.953]  I want to show people the carbon cycle of life.
[00:49:40.273 --> 00:49:41.674]  We're carbon-based life forms.
[00:49:41.714 --> 00:49:43.635]  It's a tax on breathing, a tax on life.
[00:49:44.235 --> 00:49:45.737]  And yes, all of this is happening.
[00:49:47.418 --> 00:49:53.742]  Just banks taking over everything, grabbing everything, no jobs, you'll all be on government welfare basically by the time they're done with it.
[00:49:54.182 --> 00:49:55.103]  I mean, it's just hellish.
[00:49:55.183 --> 00:49:56.424]  It's just hellish what they're setting up.
[00:49:57.084 --> 00:49:58.025]  Go ahead, Farmer Stan.
[00:49:58.814 --> 00:49:59.694]  You're exactly right, Alex.
[00:49:59.714 --> 00:50:01.535]  They want to do away with crop insurance now.
[00:50:01.795 --> 00:50:06.758]  Department of Conservation, they want to do away with coming out and building a pond for you free.
[00:50:07.418 --> 00:50:11.400]  We've got a high level of crime going down here in Pettis County today.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.522]  In Missouri, 15 businesses got broke into last week.
[00:50:15.202 --> 00:50:18.844]  And you're wanting to put the 20,000 troops out on the streets.
[00:50:19.164 --> 00:50:21.305]  You say people are living in denial with that.
[00:50:21.965 --> 00:50:26.307]  People, they think your show has become nothing more than entertainment, Alex.
[00:50:26.347 --> 00:50:27.528]  They think it's a soap opera.
[00:50:29.332 --> 00:50:30.855]  Well, I wish it was a sub, Barbara.
[00:50:30.915 --> 00:50:32.057]  It's real as it gets.
[00:50:32.077 --> 00:50:32.517]  Stay with us.
[00:50:32.557 --> 00:50:33.599]  Back in 70 seconds.

[00:50:43.971 --> 00:50:45.553]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:45.673 --> 00:50:50.279]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:53.203]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:50:53.384 --> 00:50:56.247]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:50:56.428 --> 00:51:01.134]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:01.354 --> 00:51:02.295]  If you simply prepare.
[00:51:02.495 --> 00:51:05.457]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:05.737 --> 00:51:12.623]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.

[00:51:32.541 --> 00:51:33.122]  Take action today.
[00:51:33.162 --> 00:51:34.984]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:46.784 --> 00:51:48.684]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:49.165 --> 00:51:52.125]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:56.446 --> 00:52:03.928]  Here we are, already into hour number four.
[00:52:04.688 --> 00:52:09.430]  Painted breath, by this time tomorrow, our new leader will have been sworn in for hours.
[00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:12.670]  The new coronation of the Savior.
[00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:14.831]  All our problems will be solved.
[00:52:17.193 --> 00:52:20.134]  Unless people in the public don't get behind the president.
[00:52:20.954 --> 00:52:22.195]  We are all one.
[00:52:22.275 --> 00:52:26.476]  Earlier you showed a photo from out there where it says we are all one with Obama.
[00:52:27.777 --> 00:52:31.078]  And all the pundits are saying Obama can save the economy.
[00:52:32.238 --> 00:52:36.880]  When I was on vacation last week I watched more Fox and CNN and MSNBC than I normally do at night.
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:39.221]  And I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
[00:52:39.241 --> 00:52:42.782]  It was such classical, overblown, cartoon level
[00:52:44.502 --> 00:52:45.083]  Propaganda.
[00:52:46.124 --> 00:52:59.603]  And it was just both parties, you know, all these pundits going, well, Obama's got a plan, he's got experts that can fix it, but, you know, he'll give us a great economy, everything will be fine, the people will join him and work with him and do what he says.
[00:53:00.404 --> 00:53:02.426]  And then I'd turn to the next channel, it'd be the same thing.
[00:53:02.926 --> 00:53:18.440]  Obama, he can do it, he can... I mean, normally the media acts like the two parties are fighting, and one party's got the answers and the other doesn't, and, you know, the government's not good, but the media'll help you know what to do, and the government's just stupid and makes a lot of mistakes.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:22.841]  Now it's just, he is perfect.
[00:53:23.361 --> 00:53:25.802]  So what if his new Treasury Secretary doesn't pay taxes?
[00:53:26.242 --> 00:53:27.762]  So what if most of Congress doesn't?
[00:53:28.062 --> 00:53:28.942]  That's only for us!
[00:53:28.982 --> 00:53:30.303]  We must do whatever they say!
[00:53:30.783 --> 00:53:32.684]  We must follow everything they say!
[00:53:33.024 --> 00:53:34.284]  We've got to get behind them!
[00:53:34.984 --> 00:53:36.565]  And the approval rating just goes up and up.
[00:53:36.625 --> 00:53:37.305]  It's just, ah!
[00:53:38.385 --> 00:53:40.386]  I was from McCain, but now I like him!
[00:53:40.626 --> 00:53:42.406]  I am under your control!
[00:53:42.906 --> 00:53:43.887]  Obama!
[00:53:44.367 --> 00:53:44.707]  Obama!
[00:53:44.767 --> 00:53:46.367]  It's like Body Snatchers or something.
[00:53:49.252 --> 00:53:52.114]  As the economy gets worse and worse, they'll say, gotta do what he says.
[00:53:53.055 --> 00:53:55.736]  Oh, they need another banker bailout for the subprime mortgages.
[00:53:55.776 --> 00:53:57.077]  Oh, we didn't spend the money on the last one.
[00:53:57.317 --> 00:53:57.998]  We need another one.
[00:53:58.018 --> 00:53:59.239]  We need unlimited power.
[00:53:59.759 --> 00:54:01.160]  We've gotta do whatever he says.
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:03.261]  Whatever he says.
[00:54:03.281 --> 00:54:05.403]  And if we just do it, it'll be alright.
[00:54:06.676 --> 00:54:11.619]  I mean, this is sick, and I just hate constant news with reporters going, this is wonderful!
[00:54:12.039 --> 00:54:14.000]  Oh my God, it's so great here in D.C.
[00:54:14.261 --> 00:54:15.001]  Cut to the next channel.
[00:54:15.261 --> 00:54:16.682]  Oh my gosh, it's so wonderful.
[00:54:16.742 --> 00:54:17.603]  Just smiling people.
[00:54:17.843 --> 00:54:20.424]  The reporters are all, oh, it's like heaven here.
[00:54:20.444 --> 00:54:21.025]  Look at this crowd.
[00:54:21.045 --> 00:54:26.488]  The crowd's like, and the crowd's just like, oh my God, oh, oh, I love everything, oh my.
[00:54:26.508 --> 00:54:27.669]  I mean, you look at their eyes.
[00:54:27.689 --> 00:54:28.609]  We could show you video of them.
[00:54:28.649 --> 00:54:29.309]  I mean, you've seen them.
[00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:31.471]  They're on the news, and the eyes are all the same.
[00:54:31.511 --> 00:54:34.973]  It's just like, and you'll see men and women just going,
[00:54:37.728 --> 00:54:38.751]  You know, like one face will be gone.
[00:54:38.771 --> 00:54:40.957]  And then you look to the next person and they're gone.
[00:54:40.977 --> 00:54:44.487]  And you'll see, you'll see the crowd.
[00:54:44.567 --> 00:54:45.450]  I mean, everybody's going.
[00:54:48.896 --> 00:54:58.624]  I mean, it's just everybody is just, oh, smiling radiantly and having quiet moments of reflection about how, and then person after person they cut to.
[00:54:59.084 --> 00:55:09.253]  From the night he won and had the victory speech out there, it was women and men going, oh, my problems are solved, my bills, my children's future, my health care, it's incredible!
[00:55:09.273 --> 00:55:10.914]  Everything is fixed!
[00:55:11.074 --> 00:55:12.275]  Oh, Obama!
[00:55:12.676 --> 00:55:15.578]  Oh, God, I love him!
[00:55:17.939 --> 00:55:19.280]  But the military's here!
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:21.660]  They're saving us!
[00:55:22.221 --> 00:55:30.883]  Meanwhile, all the shops are shutting down, economy's folding, everything's getting seized by foreign banks, everything's shutting down, the bankers are stealing trillions a week.
[00:55:30.963 --> 00:55:31.944]  Trillions a week!
[00:55:31.964 --> 00:55:33.864]  Stealing everything!
[00:55:33.884 --> 00:55:37.705]  And then the publisher's like, oh my god, it's so wonderful!
[00:55:38.346 --> 00:55:41.827]  Oh my god, I love you!
[00:55:41.907 --> 00:55:42.807]  I'm not kidding!
[00:55:42.887 --> 00:55:43.547]  I'm like, what?
[00:55:43.587 --> 00:55:45.388]  I'm in a Twilight Zone episode!
[00:55:47.264 --> 00:55:55.292]  I mean, this guy is bringing in the most hardcore IMF and World Bankers just to fill his administration.
[00:55:55.332 --> 00:55:56.813]  This guy right here, Timothy Gethner.
[00:55:57.674 --> 00:55:59.836]  And it's like, well, he didn't pay his taxes, he doesn't.
[00:56:00.157 --> 00:56:01.017]  So what?
[00:56:01.057 --> 00:56:02.098]  Congress doesn't pay them.
[00:56:02.419 --> 00:56:04.341]  Over 65% of Congress doesn't pay taxes.
[00:56:04.926 --> 00:56:09.933]  They just say, I don't care if it's a law, because this guy used to be involved with the IMF and World Bank.
[00:56:10.214 --> 00:56:12.497]  Of course he doesn't pay taxes to himself.
[00:56:12.778 --> 00:56:17.925]  That's where you write your checks to the Federal Reserve, the Regional Bank of International Settlements.
[00:56:18.005 --> 00:56:19.708]  You pay your taxes to him!
[00:56:20.729 --> 00:56:26.411]  And then he takes it and buys the military and the media and then charges you interest on the money you've got to pay taxes on.
[00:56:26.812 --> 00:56:27.232]  Look at him!
[00:56:27.272 --> 00:56:27.812]  It's funny!
[00:56:28.132 --> 00:56:29.033]  Look how he's predatory.
[00:56:29.073 --> 00:56:31.354]  Look how he's into being hardcore and savage.
[00:56:31.774 --> 00:56:33.494]  He's, take your cancer shots.
[00:56:33.855 --> 00:56:35.755]  Let the CPS take your children.
[00:56:36.256 --> 00:56:37.536]  Let us engineer you.
[00:56:37.836 --> 00:56:38.757]  We know what's best.
[00:56:38.837 --> 00:56:39.997]  We're the super class.
[00:56:40.337 --> 00:56:41.418]  We're in control.
[00:56:41.438 --> 00:56:42.738]  And the Baba's like, yes!
[00:56:42.758 --> 00:56:42.898]  Oh, Baba!
[00:56:42.918 --> 00:56:46.020]  And people just going...
[00:56:47.541 --> 00:56:49.503]  I'm just savoring this moment.
[00:56:49.824 --> 00:56:51.025]  For weeks, just dancing.
[00:56:51.285 --> 00:56:51.986]  Oh yeah!
[00:56:52.447 --> 00:56:54.409]  Oh my gosh, everything's so good!
[00:56:54.429 --> 00:57:00.757]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:57:01.137 --> 00:57:02.800]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:57:03.775 --> 00:57:04.796]  But who is the enemy?
[00:57:05.317 --> 00:57:05.797]  Bin Laden.
[00:57:06.117 --> 00:57:07.098]  This is his M.O.
[00:57:07.118 --> 00:57:08.380]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.141]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:57:10.482 --> 00:57:17.228]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:57:17.629 --> 00:57:18.069]  Some U.S.
[00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:23.755]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:57:24.455 --> 00:57:27.957]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:57:27.977 --> 00:57:38.182]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:57:38.422 --> 00:57:39.162]  Fabled enemies.

[00:59:20.371 --> 00:59:22.452]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.

[01:00:13.093 --> 01:00:15.615]  There it is, the Carbon Cycle.
[01:00:19.497 --> 01:00:20.038]  And uh...
[01:00:21.158 --> 01:00:30.488]  They've even, this is one of the new propaganda ones where they even have the fossil fuel production from factories and cars.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:35.302]  Which, according to the United Nations, is a tiny fraction.
[01:00:36.183 --> 01:00:37.744]  Less than one half of one percent.
[01:00:37.784 --> 01:00:39.065]  I mean, that's their own numbers.
[01:00:39.766 --> 01:00:40.946]  Has nothing to do with anything.

[01:00:44.109 --> 01:00:46.370]  They've done the calculations on this of all human activity.
[01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:48.211]  One big volcano is more.
[01:00:49.152 --> 01:00:53.976]  One gaseous explosion from a volcano puts out more CO2, take the case of Mount St.
[01:00:54.016 --> 01:00:58.659]  Helens, than all of human activity in the previous hundred years to that, conservatively.
[01:01:00.447 --> 01:01:01.687]  And what makes the grass grow?
[01:01:03.288 --> 01:01:04.748]  CO2, literally.
[01:01:05.068 --> 01:01:10.009]  What makes the plankton have a great day in the ocean so the little fishies, so the krill can eat it?
[01:01:10.049 --> 01:01:12.250]  And the little fishies can eat the krill, the little shrimps.
[01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:15.210]  But now the shrimps are with Al-Qaeda.
[01:01:16.031 --> 01:01:19.091]  The global government is doing nothing about all the true environmental crises.
[01:01:19.111 --> 01:01:19.911]  I'm going to cover this later.
[01:01:20.371 --> 01:01:22.932]  But they are doing something about the carbon cycle.
[01:01:22.952 --> 01:01:26.313]  They are taxing the entire carbon cycle.
[01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:31.911]  Bring me back up to a close-up of that so I can show the viewers here, and then talk about it for the radio audience.
[01:01:33.472 --> 01:01:39.774]  You see, you have water vapor in the atmosphere, which is composed of predominantly CO2.
[01:01:41.815 --> 01:01:44.915]  And it's one of the dominant majority gases in the atmosphere.
[01:01:45.976 --> 01:01:50.317]  And then it condenses into water vapor and rains back down into the ocean.
[01:01:50.337 --> 01:01:52.598]  Right here.
[01:01:53.928 --> 01:01:55.689]  Oh my God, it's going to kill the Earth.
[01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:57.831]  But Obama will save us.
[01:02:00.793 --> 01:02:06.318]  And then it goes back up in condensation and forms clouds again and continues.
[01:02:06.698 --> 01:02:11.061]  But the trees, look, the trees, evil trees.
[01:02:11.101 --> 01:02:16.505]  That's why a lot of the cultists that have bought into this and really believe that carbon's deadly, they're saying cut down all the trees.
[01:02:16.746 --> 01:02:17.166]  Don't believe me?
[01:02:17.186 --> 01:02:17.606]  Just Google.
[01:02:17.626 --> 01:02:18.167]  Mainstream news.
[01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:24.971]  Climate change crowd wants to cut down trees, but let's continue with the other evil things.
[01:02:25.291 --> 01:02:36.873]  They've got cows, as if there haven't always been bovine and other forms of mammals and other creatures on the land that are eating, and iguanas, and every other creature puts off methane.
[01:02:37.333 --> 01:02:39.033]  Ooh, they list those evil cows.
[01:02:40.914 --> 01:02:46.134]  The very life cycle of the earth being listed as toxic, deadly waste.
[01:02:47.275 --> 01:02:48.655]  Meanwhile, genetic engineering,
[01:02:50.416 --> 01:02:56.086]  Gender-bending chemicals being dumped into the rivers and lakes and oceans causing all sorts of deformities.
[01:02:56.487 --> 01:02:58.270]  Humans having all sorts of problems from this.
[01:02:59.446 --> 01:03:00.507]  None of that's being stopped.
[01:03:00.827 --> 01:03:02.168]  In fact, that's being turned loose completely.
[01:03:02.188 --> 01:03:06.291]  See, because the corporations can't just have a phony environmental movement to tax and regulate and run your life.
[01:03:06.851 --> 01:03:07.552]  They've got to do more.
[01:03:07.872 --> 01:03:13.596]  They need to use this as a distraction to all the real environmental crises and issues we have to deal with.
[01:03:13.837 --> 01:03:22.243]  They have to pick an issue that can be selectively enforced against the population and selectively enforced against companies, smaller companies, that the establishment wants to run out of business.
[01:03:22.563 --> 01:03:26.165]  This is a total straitjacket on the planet, the carbon cycle,
[01:03:27.026 --> 01:03:29.227]  Taxing the carbon cycle.
[01:03:29.847 --> 01:03:34.228]  There's 76% water, 75% salt, 1% fresh.
[01:03:35.088 --> 01:03:36.348]  That's really an old bad number.
[01:03:36.428 --> 01:03:39.289]  It's because there's so much fresh water in the aquifers.
[01:03:39.369 --> 01:03:40.669]  It's really more like 4%.
[01:03:40.809 --> 01:03:43.090]  So we're talking getting up close to 80% water.
[01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:46.010]  But technically it's under the surface.
[01:03:47.351 --> 01:03:49.051]  But here it all is.
[01:03:50.256 --> 01:04:00.503]  And so, they can ban and regulate and tax and control and have bureaucrats overseeing everything you do, because everything on this planet that's natural is carbon-based.
[01:04:02.064 --> 01:04:18.056]  And CO2 is not a toxic waste, because let me show you, these little evil things called trees right here, those little green things there on your screen, those put off more carbon than all our cars and all our buses and all our factories could ever do.
[01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:38.238]  Now the United Nations itself claims that the increase in temperature that we saw in the last decade, that 6% of that was attributed to less than one half of 1% and some estimates are even lower from human CO2 and other greenhouse gases.
[01:04:43.863 --> 01:04:44.544]  So there you have it.
[01:04:44.564 --> 01:04:47.005]  They're basically terraforming the Earth in the opposite direction.
[01:04:47.285 --> 01:04:52.789]  Meanwhile, there's thousands of aircraft spraying chemtrails, manipulating the weather everywhere, and devastating the atmosphere.
[01:04:53.209 --> 01:04:58.112]  And the military detonated hundreds of nuclear weapons in the high atmosphere, blowing holes in the ozone layer.
[01:04:58.593 --> 01:05:00.194]  And they're using DU all over the planet.
[01:05:00.394 --> 01:05:01.595]  But that's not an issue.
[01:05:02.895 --> 01:05:07.298]  Detectors in England and the United States, every time they use DU, picking up the DU in the atmosphere.
[01:05:07.418 --> 01:05:08.439]  Because let me show you the planet.
[01:05:08.759 --> 01:05:09.900]  Punch up the planet for me.
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:10.460]  Planet Earth.
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.201]  And we're going to your calls.
[01:05:12.961 --> 01:05:14.342]  Punch up the planet for me.
[01:05:14.963 --> 01:05:16.444]  Well, hell, it's right here on the screen.
[01:05:16.464 --> 01:05:17.425]  Here, just cut to this.
[01:05:18.986 --> 01:05:19.967]  Let me show people something.
[01:05:20.587 --> 01:05:20.947]  Right here.
[01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:23.149]  Here, I'll just pick the microphone up and come over here.
[01:05:23.509 --> 01:05:23.970]  You see this?
[01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:25.111]  This is the globe, okay?
[01:05:25.131 --> 01:05:27.212]  I'm going to come over here and I'm going to show you.
[01:05:27.232 --> 01:05:29.234]  The jet stream goes this way.
[01:05:29.995 --> 01:05:31.656]  Jet stream goes that way.
[01:05:32.437 --> 01:05:39.282]  And the jet stream actually dips in at one of the lowest points from, you know, 30, 40, 50, 60 thousand feet where it varies.
[01:05:39.843 --> 01:05:41.084]  It dips down
[01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:44.540]  Right over New Mexico, Texas and Louisiana.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:45.580]  That's its main dip point.
[01:05:45.601 --> 01:05:48.863]  You can go online and watch the satellites with the infrared of the jet stream.
[01:05:49.103 --> 01:05:58.991]  And it comes in right across Southern North America and it comes right in at New Mexico, Texas and it dumps in.
[01:05:59.131 --> 01:06:00.672]  Now, you know why that's a problem?
[01:06:02.033 --> 01:06:03.134]  You know why it's a problem?
[01:06:03.695 --> 01:06:11.101]  Because most of the detritus and the really dirty factories and the chemicals and the trash burning in China and in India
[01:06:12.518 --> 01:06:16.080]  Where there's almost two and a half billion people.
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:17.021]  No, it's more than two and a half billion.
[01:06:17.041 --> 01:06:24.206]  It'd be two billion seven hundred million, excuse me, in China and India.
[01:06:24.826 --> 01:06:27.608]  That all blows across the jet stream.
[01:06:27.628 --> 01:06:29.409]  In fact, can you guys back that video up on screen?
[01:06:29.449 --> 01:06:31.030]  I can show people for them.
[01:06:32.091 --> 01:06:34.332]  Right behind me.
[01:06:34.472 --> 01:06:35.473]  So there you have the Earth.
[01:06:35.513 --> 01:06:36.753]  Yes, that's good.
[01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:39.475]  This is a view of North America.
[01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:40.516]  No, that's a view of Africa.
[01:06:42.352 --> 01:06:46.714]  So I need a shot of the planet from the other side.
[01:06:46.734 --> 01:06:54.399]  Of course, people will probably say it's a conspiracy theory and the planet doesn't exist next, but the point is that, yeah, here's the globe.
[01:06:55.059 --> 01:06:55.439]  Now look.
[01:06:58.081 --> 01:07:02.983]  You've got the jet stream going this way.
[01:07:03.003 --> 01:07:04.444]  It's going around the planet.
[01:07:07.904 --> 01:07:27.071]  They seem to be focusing on the jet stream a lot with the chemtrail spring, but regardless of that, you've got China and India, and then you've also got the Middle East, Iraq, Serbia, and Central Asia, Afghanistan, where tens of thousands of tons of DU have been dropped and are dispersed through the atmosphere.
[01:07:27.471 --> 01:07:32.853]  That's why a lot of times you'll see orange dust on your car and it'll be on the news that that blew in from Mongolia, China.
[01:07:34.113 --> 01:07:34.854]  So back it up again.
[01:07:34.894 --> 01:07:35.894]  I'm going to show people viewing.
[01:07:36.883 --> 01:07:38.864]  Oh, yeah, here's a good shot of the United States.
[01:07:39.245 --> 01:07:39.765]  Cut to this one.
[01:07:41.046 --> 01:07:43.287]  So, the jet stream is blowing this way.
[01:07:43.307 --> 01:07:52.514]  Okay, and it goes around the world to China and comes back around the Middle East, China, and it comes back and it dumps right here.
[01:07:53.534 --> 01:07:54.375]  So it's going around.
[01:07:55.692 --> 01:07:57.976]  All on the other side of Asia and Europe and the rest of it.
[01:07:58.677 --> 01:08:04.946]  And it comes around and it dumps most of its detritus on New Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana.
[01:08:09.045 --> 01:08:15.168]  Google Live Satellite Imaging, Live Satellite of Jetstream.
[01:08:15.848 --> 01:08:19.610]  And we will show them a 24-hour rendering of the satellite the last 24 hours.
[01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:24.772]  I checked this last week, about a week and a half ago, and all of it was dumping into Texas at the time.
[01:08:25.492 --> 01:08:26.253]  But it varies.
[01:08:27.193 --> 01:08:31.635]  It varies in its dumping.
[01:08:32.255 --> 01:08:36.057]  And it dumps a little other places too, but we get the full helping of the DU right here.
[01:08:37.847 --> 01:08:40.008]  Now that's a satellite shot of North America.
[01:08:43.249 --> 01:08:49.391]  Okay, that is a jet stream, um, shot of a limited air, that's the Canadian jet stream.
[01:08:49.691 --> 01:08:52.793]  There's several jet streams, but the main, one of the main jet streams.
[01:08:53.213 --> 01:08:54.273]  Show me another jet stream here.
[01:08:56.274 --> 01:09:04.717]  I'll probably get emails saying there's no such thing as a jet stream, but the point is, I'm not kidding, they say there's no North American Union, they say there's no Trans-Atlantic Corridor, um,
[01:09:07.864 --> 01:09:08.464]  No, it doesn't matter.
[01:09:08.504 --> 01:09:09.485]  I'll find it during a break.
[01:09:12.886 --> 01:09:13.266]  You know what?
[01:09:15.147 --> 01:09:16.328]  Just Google JetStream.
[01:09:18.209 --> 01:09:18.869]  Ah, it doesn't matter.
[01:09:20.409 --> 01:09:23.571]  And I can show you how it's all dumping on you, but none of that is a real issue.
[01:09:23.611 --> 01:09:25.652]  We just need to tax the carbon footprint.
[01:09:25.672 --> 01:09:26.552]  Let's go back to the calls.
[01:09:26.572 --> 01:09:28.653]  Who's up next here?
[01:09:29.654 --> 01:09:32.095]  Charles in Florida, then Matt, Ron, Ronnie, and others.
[01:09:32.115 --> 01:09:32.715]  Go ahead, Charles.
[01:09:35.945 --> 01:09:36.185]  Alex?
[01:09:36.666 --> 01:09:37.226]  Yes, Charles.
[01:09:37.466 --> 01:09:38.227]  Hey, how you doing, man?
[01:09:38.247 --> 01:09:38.707]  What's up, man?
[01:09:39.948 --> 01:09:45.332]  Before I say anything else, I just want to tell you, I'm an African-American listener, so you do have African-American listeners, if you didn't know.
[01:09:45.452 --> 01:09:46.033]  Oh, I know.
[01:09:46.113 --> 01:09:47.193]  I know a lot of great folks.
[01:09:48.394 --> 01:09:48.715]  Listen.
[01:09:49.355 --> 01:10:02.485]  Yeah, I just want to say about my people and this whole Obama crap, and most black people, the majority of us, they can't and they just don't want to believe that Obama's not the Messiah.
[01:10:03.522 --> 01:10:09.590]  Yeah, like, uh, they don't want to, uh, excuse me, they don't want to do anything like, uh, they wouldn't do anything the news wouldn't say.
[01:10:10.436 --> 01:10:14.438]  And because of that, it's just like Bush supporters.
[01:10:14.979 --> 01:10:25.684]  Once they signed on to Bush, didn't matter if he tortured, secret arrest, destroyed the Bill of Rights, tripled the size of the BATF, it was, you know what, I'm sticking behind the Commander-in-Chief.
[01:10:25.704 --> 01:10:31.328]  And it's going to be the same thing with Obama, but with the media, just cult-like saying, he's the answer, he's the answer.
[01:10:31.608 --> 01:10:37.051]  I mean, ten times worse, so people will go, I just can't say I've been conned, I just love you.
[01:10:38.038 --> 01:10:39.658]  Yeah, for example, like my own mother.
[01:10:39.678 --> 01:10:40.639]  My own mom.
[01:10:41.319 --> 01:10:43.519]  Like, she doesn't believe me about anything I tell you.
[01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:57.983]  I mean, tell her from, like, what you say, or, like, I give her articles after article after article, and, like, she doesn't want to read it, or... I told her, like, in early August, because you had an article, I believe, like, that said the real economy, and you had listed all the stores that were closing.
[01:10:58.563 --> 01:11:05.004]  She didn't want to look at it, and I said, Mom, we need to start, you know, buying food and start saving our money, and, you know, we need to get gold and silver.
[01:11:05.124 --> 01:11:07.465]  And I was adamant about getting gold and silver.
[01:11:07.833 --> 01:11:15.278]  But see, in the end, your mother is going to say Obama's good because they're going to wreck the economy to force us onto the government dole.
[01:11:15.858 --> 01:11:17.139]  And then they'll still be the saviors.
[01:11:17.179 --> 01:11:18.600]  See how they wreck things on purpose?
[01:11:19.121 --> 01:11:21.402]  Yeah, and I would tell my mother, like, we need to get gold in the film.
[01:11:21.422 --> 01:11:24.444]  She was like, well, my financial advisor didn't say that.
[01:11:24.564 --> 01:11:25.445]  Oprah didn't say that.
[01:11:25.485 --> 01:11:26.526]  The View didn't say that.
[01:11:26.626 --> 01:11:29.748]  And, you know, my pastor, our pastor didn't say that.
[01:11:30.345 --> 01:11:31.346]  I just can't believe you.
[01:11:31.366 --> 01:11:33.027]  You know, you're not a professional.
[01:11:33.047 --> 01:11:39.533]  Well, The View and all these other shows, they didn't tell you to buy gold five years ago when it was $300 an ounce.
[01:11:39.793 --> 01:11:40.474]  It's now $850.
[01:11:40.514 --> 01:11:42.916]  Yeah, I know.
[01:11:42.936 --> 01:11:44.898]  It's so frustrating.
[01:11:45.178 --> 01:11:46.900]  I don't know why you're doing this.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:47.821]  Well, stay there.
[01:11:47.841 --> 01:11:48.882]  Let's talk more about it when we get back.
[01:11:48.902 --> 01:11:53.085]  And then I'm going to get into a bunch of news on Obama and the coronation tomorrow.
[01:11:54.506 --> 01:11:55.527]  On September 11, 2001, along with
[01:11:57.697 --> 01:11:59.978]  Hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:12:00.198 --> 01:12:01.518]  And we knew what to do.
[01:12:01.538 --> 01:12:03.299]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:12:03.539 --> 01:12:09.961]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:12:10.561 --> 01:12:19.084]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:26.272]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:12:26.572 --> 01:12:29.614]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:12:29.734 --> 01:12:34.958]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

[01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:56.784]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:12:57.185 --> 01:13:02.669]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:03.730]  That's right.
[01:13:04.051 --> 01:13:07.293]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:13:07.754 --> 01:13:13.819]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:13:14.383 --> 01:13:22.068]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:13:22.508 --> 01:13:27.311]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:13:27.984 --> 01:13:33.008]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:13:33.808 --> 01:13:37.931]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[01:13:38.591 --> 01:13:40.513]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:13:40.573 --> 01:13:40.873]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:13:41.173 --> 01:13:41.453]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[01:15:57.389 --> 01:15:59.950]  Man, this show today is just blasting past us and I do want to
[01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:06.379]  Go over the fact that they're demonizing 9-11 Truth on television saying we're terrorists.
[01:16:06.399 --> 01:16:12.109]  It's a new development in a string of activities they've been engaged in.
[01:16:12.129 --> 01:16:14.673]  I do want to break down, and I'll do it more tomorrow.
[01:16:16.243 --> 01:16:21.986]  What Obama's really doing, and the distractions within the diversions, the wheels within wheels.
[01:16:22.106 --> 01:16:26.888]  But up on screen, we did find the last seven-day animation of the jet stream.
[01:16:27.368 --> 01:16:30.290]  And I told you it dumps normally over New Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana.
[01:16:30.650 --> 01:16:33.271]  It's moved a bit east there, a couple hundred miles.
[01:16:34.252 --> 01:16:41.335]  But you can read the different graphs of the height of the jet stream, where it tends to come in and dump its particula.
[01:16:42.115 --> 01:16:44.837]  And there you have it, the jet stream coming in.
[01:16:46.211 --> 01:16:55.753]  From the west to east and right there on the screen dumping over New Mexico, dumping over Texas and then rising back up in the atmosphere over the east.
[01:16:55.773 --> 01:16:59.654]  So you see it dumping right there over the state of Texas.
[01:16:59.794 --> 01:17:02.014]  All that nice depleted uranium for you and your family.
[01:17:02.694 --> 01:17:06.095]  All that nice toxins and things from China and India.
[01:17:06.635 --> 01:17:06.975]  All of it.
[01:17:07.095 --> 01:17:09.456]  Nothing being done by the illustrious loving government.
[01:17:10.136 --> 01:17:12.396]  But they will tax everything you do and control your life.
[01:17:13.056 --> 01:17:14.837]  Finishing up quickly with Charles in Florida.
[01:17:14.857 --> 01:17:15.357]  Anything else sir?
[01:17:15.967 --> 01:17:16.968]  Yeah, how much time I got?
[01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:19.350]  Go ahead.
[01:17:20.130 --> 01:17:26.315]  I just want to say, I remember when he won the election, I remember when he talked about the public being dumbed down.
[01:17:26.335 --> 01:17:27.996]  I'm not saying my people are dumb or anything.
[01:17:28.397 --> 01:17:31.339]  Well, it's not only black folks that are watching Obama.
[01:17:31.479 --> 01:17:32.540]  Yeah, I know, I'm just saying.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:34.922]  Black folks are what, 12% of the population.
[01:17:34.982 --> 01:17:38.024]  It was white people that were the main group electing him.
[01:17:38.364 --> 01:17:43.068]  Yeah, when I went to work and I told people that I had voted for Cynthia McCain, I voted
[01:17:43.410 --> 01:17:44.450]  You just voted for Satan.
[01:17:44.530 --> 01:17:45.671]  You didn't vote for Obama.
[01:17:45.931 --> 01:17:51.732]  These are people I would consider good friends, if not associates.
[01:17:51.972 --> 01:17:53.212]  Well, she's saying he's bad.
[01:17:53.312 --> 01:17:54.233]  She's saying he's bad.
[01:17:54.673 --> 01:17:58.374]  Yeah, and I'm trying to tell them that the government is using him.
[01:17:58.394 --> 01:17:59.334]  He doesn't run anything.
[01:17:59.394 --> 01:18:01.874]  He works for them, not the other way around.
[01:18:02.915 --> 01:18:03.735]  He's just a puppet.
[01:18:03.975 --> 01:18:07.276]  He's the emcee, the spokesperson for the men behind the mirror.
[01:18:07.656 --> 01:18:08.776]  They don't want to see it.
[01:18:08.796 --> 01:18:09.636]  They can't take it.
[01:18:09.656 --> 01:18:10.316]  It hurts them inside.
[01:18:13.464 --> 01:18:21.408]  Honestly, I believe like 8 years from now, like still, people will be like, no, he was the first black president, you're racist, I'm black and I'm a racist, you know?
[01:18:22.976 --> 01:18:23.896]  He's our new O.J.
[01:18:23.996 --> 01:18:25.677]  He's our new Michael Jackson.
[01:18:25.797 --> 01:18:26.877]  Well, it was like after 9-11.
[01:18:27.118 --> 01:18:30.679]  If you weren't for everything Bush was doing, you were with Al Qaeda.
[01:18:30.699 --> 01:18:31.479]  I appreciate your call.
[01:18:31.859 --> 01:18:33.580]  It's either you're with us or you're against us.
[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:38.261]  Meanwhile, he's saying the banks are totally going to take over even more.
[01:18:38.281 --> 01:18:40.062]  I mean, this is the change.
[01:18:40.102 --> 01:18:41.122]  There is change.
[01:18:41.382 --> 01:18:43.163]  They're putting the whole New World Order in high gear.
[01:18:44.103 --> 01:18:45.684]  Let's go ahead and go to another call here.
[01:18:46.084 --> 01:18:47.565]  Let's talk to Matt in Connecticut.
[01:18:47.745 --> 01:18:48.465]  Matt, you're on the air.
[01:18:49.418 --> 01:18:50.879]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:18:51.219 --> 01:18:51.760]  Thanks for calling.
[01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:52.861]  I appreciate what you do.
[01:18:52.881 --> 01:18:56.543]  I just have two quick questions, I'll make it as quick as I can.
[01:18:57.204 --> 01:19:07.331]  First one, I was wondering, I have trouble sharing this with people, so I was wondering what is sort of the most fundamental, easy to articulate, yet impossible to dispute 9-11, you know,
[01:19:11.670 --> 01:19:15.271]  We have two different embassy heads in Canada and Saudi Arabia, U.S.
[01:19:15.311 --> 01:19:22.593]  citizens, saying that they learned, they were ordered to give the supposed hijackers visas into the U.S.
[01:19:22.713 --> 01:19:28.535]  in the months before 9-11, when they were listed as supposed al-Qaeda in the computers, and they were told, look, it's okay, let them in.
[01:19:29.416 --> 01:19:33.097]  These passports are, these visas are their cover.
[01:19:33.457 --> 01:19:36.138]  They're really CIA operatives, and then the
[01:19:37.358 --> 01:19:37.498]  Let's
[01:19:52.315 --> 01:20:08.067]  And then from there you have the NORAD drills of hijacked jets attacking the exact same buildings at the exact same time on record, and all the NORAD and FAA tapes saying, why are there all these drills going on at the same time as this is really happening?
[01:20:08.107 --> 01:20:11.329]  Why am I having fake blips put all over my screens?
[01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:14.612]  Why has somebody hijacked the computer systems?
[01:20:15.392 --> 01:20:16.113]  I mean, right there!
[01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:21.051]  Okay, that's a good one.
[01:20:50.191 --> 01:21:01.765]  And then you notice all those groups will savagely attack all the legitimate thermate research, all the legitimate bombs in the buildings research, Marvin Bush running security, Larry Silverstein saying, you know, we're going to blow the building up.
[01:21:03.072 --> 01:21:12.018]  Then those that are pushing all the other space beam theories, they will savagely attack us, try to take over the movement, and then we're nice and don't respond, they then call us agents.
[01:21:12.899 --> 01:21:15.020]  But they won't talk about those hijackers training U.S.
[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:15.720]  military bases.
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:17.822]  They'll just, shut up, it's holograms!
[01:21:20.203 --> 01:21:22.045]  And then, it's pretty sick.
[01:21:33.354 --> 01:21:35.096]  Either the state or the federal level?
[01:21:35.196 --> 01:21:35.837]  Yes, I do.
[01:21:35.857 --> 01:21:38.900]  And I'll answer that question when we return in three short minutes.
[01:21:39.481 --> 01:21:42.364]  Then we're going to get into 9-11 truth, Obama, and a lot more.
[01:21:42.404 --> 01:21:43.105]  Stay with us.
[01:21:44.366 --> 01:21:45.267]  We're on the march.
[01:21:45.768 --> 01:21:47.370]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:48.291 --> 01:21:50.974]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:23:05.163 --> 01:23:05.663]  Bin Laden.
[01:23:05.963 --> 01:23:06.965]  This is his M.O.
[01:23:06.985 --> 01:23:08.326]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:23:08.346 --> 01:23:09.988]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:23:10.328 --> 01:23:17.075]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:23:17.475 --> 01:23:17.916]  Some U.S.
[01:23:17.956 --> 01:23:23.602]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:23:24.302 --> 01:23:27.803]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:23:27.823 --> 01:23:30.603]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:23:54.636 --> 01:23:58.398]  Do you have aches and pains or suffer from indigestion or inflammation?

[01:24:47.029 --> 01:24:48.070]  Was a prisoner of doubt.
[01:25:09.818 --> 01:25:11.338]  The New World Order's not a prisoner to doubt.
[01:25:13.659 --> 01:25:16.260]  They're making their move on free humanity right now.
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:18.280]  Total dehumanization.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.841]  They believe they're taking control of human evolutionary process.
[01:25:21.901 --> 01:25:23.041]  I got a news flash for you.
[01:25:23.601 --> 01:25:25.382]  We don't compute in that future.
[01:25:26.342 --> 01:25:27.422]  You can face the facts.
[01:25:27.442 --> 01:25:31.723]  Or you can fall to the New World Order.
[01:25:33.844 --> 01:25:38.805]  As for me, I'm not going along with the merchants of death and destruction and humiliation and pain.
[01:25:40.188 --> 01:25:43.949]  I'm gonna stand with the innocents, the widows, the orphans, the little ones.
[01:25:43.969 --> 01:25:48.369]  And I'm more than happy to be chewed up, be destroyed by the New World Order.
[01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:53.410]  Because in that process, their tyranny will fall.
[01:26:06.173 --> 01:26:08.053]  The gambler understands.
[01:26:14.571 --> 01:26:16.072]  Man, it's hard to shut this song off.
[01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:19.374]  I'll take my chances on you.
[01:26:22.377 --> 01:26:23.237]  Again and again.
[01:26:23.257 --> 01:26:30.943]  These evil people are weak.
[01:26:31.823 --> 01:26:34.505]  They just don't play by the basic rules of humanity.
[01:26:37.247 --> 01:26:39.329]  They're like cancer in a body, destroying it.
[01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:42.191]  And they must be removed.
[01:26:43.666 --> 01:26:47.027]  They're coming straight on for us no matter what we do, so we might as well fight back.
[01:26:47.047 --> 01:26:50.227]  Best defense is a good offense.
[01:26:52.768 --> 01:26:56.868]  Okay, I want to answer that last caller's question and then hit two big news items.
[01:26:59.349 --> 01:27:05.350]  And I'm going to watch tonight quite a bit of the propaganda and write some notes.
[01:27:05.370 --> 01:27:09.831]  I'm going to do a big, probably 30-40 minute audio blog that will be up in the morning before the show.
[01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:14.972]  So that'll be up on InfoWars.com, my reportage on that.
[01:27:15.012 --> 01:27:16.893]  And tomorrow, I might do four, five, six, seven hours.
[01:27:16.913 --> 01:27:19.776]  I got some interviews going on out here after the show.
[01:27:20.136 --> 01:27:22.418]  And I'm on Russia Today and some other foreign news tomorrow.
[01:27:22.438 --> 01:27:28.442]  So Mike Rivera, when I'm on those channels internationally, is going to be popping in, doing news coverage here with us as well.
[01:27:28.462 --> 01:27:29.003]  I just love it.
[01:27:29.023 --> 01:27:30.024]  He looks so good on the video.
[01:27:30.044 --> 01:27:35.548]  We're trying to get more and more of our guests, you know, in studio with us via the video system.
[01:27:38.356 --> 01:27:44.578]  You know, I kind of shrink from even covering the Obama thing, though I've covered bits and pieces of it, because it's so huge.
[01:27:44.598 --> 01:27:45.518]  There's so many facets.
[01:27:45.718 --> 01:27:56.601]  I probably wrote 20 pages of notes when I was on a trip last week, and I intend to try to again go over those tonight in the audio blog, but I'll get into that here in just a moment.
[01:27:57.921 --> 01:28:05.103]  And then, of course, get into some final calls from Ron, Ronnie, Paul, and Rob, and that'll be it for calls.
[01:28:06.806 --> 01:28:16.375]  To answer the earlier caller's question, is there any action to repeal the Patriot Act or restrict it, overturn it at the state, city, or federal level?
[01:28:16.735 --> 01:28:17.816]  And let me answer that question.
[01:28:17.836 --> 01:28:22.961]  I don't like tooting my horn, but it's just a fact.
[01:28:23.041 --> 01:28:29.767]  I put out a news article back in December of 2001.
[01:28:31.969 --> 01:28:34.691]  A month or so after the passage of the Patriot Act on October 27, 2001.
[01:28:37.033 --> 01:28:43.359]  And I analyzed the bill, its attack on the First Amendment, Second Amendment, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Tenth, everything.
[01:28:44.591 --> 01:28:57.096]  And I said, what we need is people at the county and city level to reaffirm the 10th Amendment states' rights, and to go in and say, even though the feds will claim it's only symbolic, that counties and cities and states are going to follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:28:57.116 --> 01:29:00.677]  It's just a declaration that they follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and that they will not assist.
[01:29:01.197 --> 01:29:10.801]  And I got the idea from librarian groups saying, we're not going to go, you know, be part of this as a guild, and bookstores and others saying, you're not going to have a computerized list of what everybody reads, we're not going to give that to you without warrants.
[01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:14.781]  Then you've got to have oath or affirmation and probable cause.
[01:29:15.461 --> 01:29:16.741]  So that's where the original idea came from.
[01:29:16.761 --> 01:29:18.002]  I said people need to go with this.
[01:29:18.282 --> 01:29:25.864]  Some groups picked up the idea and last time I checked, Google cities or states repeal the Patriot Act.
[01:29:26.164 --> 01:29:27.305]  It'll be like three years old.
[01:29:28.365 --> 01:29:35.067]  But last time I checked, seven states repealed the Patriot Act and they said we're going to follow the Constitutional Bill of Rights.
[01:29:35.087 --> 01:29:41.589]  We're not going to, we're going to order our people in government to follow the law and to not be part of this unconstitutional monstrosity.
[01:29:43.126 --> 01:29:50.362]  And then, um, last time I checked, 800 plus cities had, uh, including Austin, Texas and many other areas.
[01:29:51.084 --> 01:29:52.827]  And that's covered in my film, The Matrix of Evil.
[01:29:54.107 --> 01:29:55.207]  Where we go down there and defeat it.
[01:29:55.887 --> 01:29:59.868]  And the city of Austin said, yes, the Bill of Rights Constitution is in force.
[01:30:00.128 --> 01:30:03.289]  And, of course, we told everybody, this Patriot Act isn't about terrorists or Al-Qaeda.
[01:30:03.589 --> 01:30:04.389]  This is for U.S.
[01:30:04.429 --> 01:30:07.249]  citizens, and this will be used against everybody.
[01:30:07.269 --> 01:30:13.070]  And it has been used in tens of thousands of drug cases, and you name it, where they go, well, we're just going to use the Patriot Act.
[01:30:13.090 --> 01:30:19.492]  We don't need no stinking warrants, where they can sneak in your house, break in, plant things if they want, without warrants.
[01:30:19.512 --> 01:30:20.472]  I mean, this is asinine.
[01:30:23.331 --> 01:30:27.172]  Especially when you know that they're shipping the majority of the narcotics in, like they ship the terrorists in.
[01:30:27.192 --> 01:30:29.213]  Again, they create the crisis, they offer the solution.
[01:30:30.773 --> 01:30:32.174]  But I've already spent a lot of time on that.
[01:30:32.194 --> 01:30:33.414]  Did you guys find one of those articles?
[01:30:36.855 --> 01:30:38.756]  Just type, Cities Repeal Patriot Act.
[01:30:39.696 --> 01:30:40.736]  States Fight Patriot Act.
[01:30:40.756 --> 01:30:41.257]  Something like that.
[01:30:42.157 --> 01:30:44.378]  I can show the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers this.
[01:30:45.098 --> 01:30:47.438]  Because obviously people have forgotten about this happening.
[01:30:50.239 --> 01:30:51.840]  Regardless, that shows what you can do at the state level.
[01:30:53.769 --> 01:30:55.991]  That said, I want to tell you about a couple sponsors that made this show possible.
[01:30:56.011 --> 01:31:00.214]  Then I'm going to get into Obama, an encapsulated analysis, and then into 9-11 Truth and then some calls.
[01:31:01.795 --> 01:31:07.479]  First off, I do want folks to know that our biggest sponsor is eFoods Direct.
[01:31:07.859 --> 01:31:10.241]  The website is eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:31:10.601 --> 01:31:13.283]  We'll put their website up on screen for you here in a little while.
[01:31:15.143 --> 01:31:21.305]  eFoodsDirect.com and I just hope that people will get prepared.
[01:31:21.345 --> 01:31:23.226]  I hope that people will be self-sufficient.
[01:31:23.646 --> 01:31:33.930]  I hope that folks will get these high-quality, grown right here in the United States, storable foods that are just so important to have, so that you're not dependent on government.
[01:31:34.170 --> 01:31:34.790]  That's their plan.
[01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:39.091]  Blow out the whole economy, bring down the society, so that your only recourse is to turn to them.
[01:31:39.792 --> 01:31:42.993]  So there's riots and things, and so the public gets sold on having trips on the streets.
[01:31:44.568 --> 01:31:47.110]  So give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:47.130 --> 01:31:47.330]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:51.094]  They'll give you free brochures or audio CDs.
[01:31:51.754 --> 01:31:57.379]  You can also go to the website and watch a lot of free videos they've got up there with all the materials and information and what's in the food.
[01:31:57.419 --> 01:31:58.180]  You can see the food.
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:00.061]  Non-GMO, right here from the U.S.
[01:32:00.101 --> 01:32:00.922]  except for the bananas.
[01:32:00.942 --> 01:32:05.806]  They have to get that up from near the, in the Caribbean area.
[01:32:06.467 --> 01:32:07.748]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:32:07.768 --> 01:32:07.828]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:11.767 --> 01:32:13.168]  Then, of course, there's a Cola Blue.
[01:32:13.208 --> 01:32:14.308]  We've got one right here in the office.
[01:32:14.348 --> 01:32:15.309]  I've got one at my house.
[01:32:15.749 --> 01:32:16.850]  What an amazing system.
[01:32:16.930 --> 01:32:18.450]  It's got seven filters.
[01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:19.011]  They corrected me.
[01:32:19.051 --> 01:32:19.511]  Not five.
[01:32:20.031 --> 01:32:23.813]  Seven filters it goes through after it just grabs humidity out of the air.
[01:32:25.454 --> 01:32:27.055]  And it condensates in there.
[01:32:28.524 --> 01:32:29.424]  And voila!
[01:32:30.084 --> 01:32:34.786]  You then have crisp, clean water with none of the byproducts that are in the major water supplies.
[01:32:34.826 --> 01:32:38.427]  In fact, I've got a news article here out of the Mail Online.
[01:32:38.467 --> 01:32:41.128]  Gender-bending chemicals in our rivers grow more potent.
[01:32:41.468 --> 01:32:51.371]  In England, the U.S., every major water supply in the United States has Prozac, Ritalin, birth control, hormones, and that's why it's killing the fish, it's making them be, you know,
[01:32:52.951 --> 01:32:55.034]  I mean, both sexes have deformities.
[01:32:55.474 --> 01:33:00.520]  A cocktail of gender-bending chemicals entering rivers and streams is more potent and harmful than anyone realizes.
[01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:01.161]  It has been revealed.
[01:33:01.201 --> 01:33:01.622]  Scientist.
[01:33:02.833 --> 01:33:07.014]  Have found an entirely new class of chemicals that is changing male fish into females.
[01:33:07.094 --> 01:33:07.895]  It just goes on from there.
[01:33:08.155 --> 01:33:08.855]  So here's the article.
[01:33:08.875 --> 01:33:11.816]  I want to show folks this article on screen.
[01:33:12.436 --> 01:33:18.358]  Anyways, Ecolablue.com or 866-585-4044.
[01:33:19.018 --> 01:33:27.381]  I mean, if you live up in northern Canada out on a farm and you've had your well tested, you don't need this.
[01:33:28.122 --> 01:33:31.503]  But for everybody else who even has wells because the rivers are going down,
[01:33:32.923 --> 01:33:36.586]  And the toxic waste from all the cities and the sewage just builds up.
[01:33:37.267 --> 01:33:41.510]  And folks are nuts if they don't have a Cola Blue or filter their water in some way.
[01:33:41.530 --> 01:33:43.571]  And this is as clean as you can get it.
[01:33:43.892 --> 01:33:46.354]  It's right out of the air.
[01:33:46.374 --> 01:33:46.774]  866-585-4044.
[01:33:47.074 --> 01:33:47.915]  ColaBlue.com.
[01:33:48.235 --> 01:33:49.216]  ColaBlue.com.
[01:33:50.877 --> 01:33:55.520]  Kind of mixed an ad in with a news article, but I happen to have that laying right there.
[01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:57.142]  I see those similar stories every day.
[01:33:58.410 --> 01:33:59.831]  Like this one, I meant to spend more time.
[01:34:00.371 --> 01:34:05.174]  They're kidnapping the old people and throwing them out of their houses in England, and then the bureaucrats move into their houses themselves.
[01:34:06.174 --> 01:34:08.376]  I covered that earlier, but this goes on in Austin all the time.
[01:34:08.656 --> 01:34:14.739]  This is one of the first things I did when I got on the air back in late 95, early 96, was fight these bastards.
[01:34:14.779 --> 01:34:19.522]  And let me tell you, you know, you tell people this is going on, and they just can't believe it, man.
[01:34:20.162 --> 01:34:26.486]  I've seen cases in Houston where if you don't pay a parking ticket, they throw old people so they can't fight back out of their house and move into the 200 grand house.
[01:34:28.888 --> 01:34:29.728]  The bureaucrats do.
[01:34:31.529 --> 01:34:32.369]  This is out in England.
[01:34:35.090 --> 01:34:37.730]  Oh my gosh, I've got all this news here I want to get to and cover.
[01:34:39.651 --> 01:34:42.872]  I can't do an overdrive today because we have folks coming into the office.
[01:34:43.272 --> 01:34:43.972]  What am I going to do?
[01:34:43.992 --> 01:34:48.333]  I don't know what to do.
[01:34:49.807 --> 01:34:56.254]  Alright, let me just be brief on the Obama, and I promise an audio blog on this, this afternoon, we post it tomorrow morning probably.
[01:34:56.274 --> 01:35:02.440]  Hell, I can probably just keep Aaron up here, poor guy, and have him upload it later.
[01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:03.842]  I can just send it over to him from my house.
[01:35:05.364 --> 01:35:09.268]  And then tomorrow, I'm going to do an in-depth breakdown of Obama, but here's the bottom line.
[01:35:09.568 --> 01:35:10.229]  Here's how they work.
[01:35:14.815 --> 01:35:19.876]  They create the staged terror, offer you the solution which you think is aimed at foreigners and truly aimed at you.
[01:35:21.777 --> 01:35:26.238]  They stage the economic collapse by design with the big central banks that have designed and engineered this.
[01:35:26.498 --> 01:35:31.540]  Then they offer the solution of unlimited tens of trillions to themselves that we've got to pay back in tax money.
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:34.780]  They say you better pass unlimited power for us in the banker bailout.
[01:35:35.841 --> 01:35:35.901]  Or,
[01:35:37.431 --> 01:35:38.993]  Uh, we will be in a depression.
[01:35:39.414 --> 01:35:51.193]  That then destroys the economy even further, which is what they want, then they don't spend any of that money, which wasn't 700 billion, they keep using that number, it's 8.5 trillion at least, to buy up everything.
[01:35:52.932 --> 01:36:04.537]  With our money that we had to pay for it in taxes and now Obama comes out and says I need even more power with a new private central bank in the United States that can just give unlimited amounts of U.S.
[01:36:04.557 --> 01:36:14.722]  currency to insurance companies, General Electric, whoever we want, buying controlling stock, buying off corporate CEOs to allow this vertical integration.
[01:36:15.242 --> 01:36:18.764]  The Rockefellers went in and took control of their oil companies again from Rex Tillerson.
[01:36:20.441 --> 01:36:24.282]  And now, ExxonMobil has announced that global warming is real, called for a global tax.
[01:36:24.382 --> 01:36:25.583]  Meanwhile, there's still people.
[01:36:25.623 --> 01:36:32.545]  You can go watch trailers for Endgame online, or go watch the interview I did with the Rothschild, where I say it's a global tax.
[01:36:32.565 --> 01:36:34.446]  And he goes, no it's not a tax, it's a conspiracy theory.
[01:36:34.906 --> 01:36:38.967]  Meanwhile, they're announcing all over the news it's a global tax, and they go, no it's not, it's a global tax.
[01:36:39.207 --> 01:36:40.768]  It's not a global tax, it's a global tax.
[01:36:41.228 --> 01:36:45.729]  And using psych warfare techniques against people, for folks to kind of go, what in the world's going on?
[01:36:47.070 --> 01:36:47.770]  Just an endless
[01:36:49.164 --> 01:36:50.806]  Tapestry of fraud and corruption.
[01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:55.051]  So again, they get everybody scared.
[01:36:55.091 --> 01:36:58.915]  They say, give up the bankers unlimited power or horrible things are going to happen.
[01:37:00.577 --> 01:37:09.307]  They then bring in Barack Obama as the savior, but this is a new wrinkle.
[01:37:10.874 --> 01:37:11.434]  In everything.
[01:37:11.934 --> 01:37:20.116]  Because normally they kind of play the left-right paradigm and demonize while at the same time building up a politician and create the illusion that they're running things and they're in charge.
[01:37:20.356 --> 01:37:22.156]  And that's happening with Obama, but on steroids.
[01:37:22.236 --> 01:37:23.796]  But there's nothing negative.
[01:37:23.836 --> 01:37:26.897]  It's just all praise and worship and he can do no wrong.
[01:37:26.937 --> 01:37:32.878]  And the key here is they say over and over again with the pundits, do whatever Barack Obama says and he will fix it.
[01:37:34.118 --> 01:37:37.279]  But the challenge, the media says, over and over again to the American people,
[01:37:38.206 --> 01:37:40.527]  Is will you do what Obama says?
[01:37:40.607 --> 01:37:41.667]  Will you help him?
[01:37:42.247 --> 01:37:47.488]  Will you come in there and by helping him, will you accept National Compulsory Service?
[01:37:47.508 --> 01:37:48.648]  You'll get a free Starbucks coffee.
[01:37:49.949 --> 01:37:51.149]  And then notice how they introduce it.
[01:37:51.169 --> 01:37:58.010]  It isn't that it's going to be work brigades or spy forces or domestic military or 18 to 24 and a new domestic military.
[01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:59.791]  That's all announced in the fine print.
[01:37:59.811 --> 01:38:00.611]  That's what they're going to do.
[01:38:00.911 --> 01:38:05.052]  But at first it's, oh, we're going to, I need all of you to help at soup kitchens.
[01:38:06.769 --> 01:38:07.874]  Well, who's against soup kitchens?
[01:38:08.296 --> 01:38:09.802]  I go and do that sometimes when I have time.
[01:38:09.983 --> 01:38:11.329]  Give money to Meals on Wheels when I can.
[01:38:12.486 --> 01:38:14.788]  But see, well, you're for soup kitchens, aren't you?
[01:38:14.828 --> 01:38:19.791]  Yeah, but I'm not for... It's like calling the Patriot Act the Patriot Act, when it's not patriotic, it's the opposite.
[01:38:19.811 --> 01:38:20.872]  Well, it's the same thing.
[01:38:21.292 --> 01:38:22.153]  This is mislabeling it.
[01:38:22.173 --> 01:38:25.795]  Well, you're for national compulsory soup kitchens, aren't you?
[01:38:26.616 --> 01:38:29.037]  I mean, you've got to roll your sleeves up and help Obama.
[01:38:29.057 --> 01:38:30.819]  That's how he's going to fix things.
[01:38:31.519 --> 01:38:37.043]  So see, on the news it'll be soup kitchens, and then, oh, and youth uniforms and kids marching around screaming,
[01:38:38.908 --> 01:38:42.469]  Hale Obama, and the mass media, the comic books, the culture.
[01:38:43.770 --> 01:38:52.512]  They've got Obama comic books, you know, where he's Superman, and Spider-Man, and he's the savior, you know, put out by Marvel Comics, going 200 bucks a piece, their first printing.
[01:38:52.813 --> 01:38:55.173]  Now into the third printing, just, oh my God, Obama!
[01:38:55.573 --> 01:38:56.474]  It's so incredible!
[01:38:56.514 --> 01:38:57.114]  He'll save us!
[01:38:57.134 --> 01:38:57.914]  He's Superman!
[01:38:58.274 --> 01:39:03.036]  Mixing false reality, the fiction reality, with reality.
[01:39:04.522 --> 01:39:07.163]  So again, Obama's coming in as the savior.
[01:39:07.243 --> 01:39:08.163]  He'll fix it all.
[01:39:08.983 --> 01:39:16.005]  You've just got to go along with the uncomfortable bad things he's going to do, like keeping FEMA camps open, closing Guantanamo, moving people to other camps.
[01:39:16.725 --> 01:39:19.085]  You've got to support all these new taxes and regulations.
[01:39:19.465 --> 01:39:21.326]  You've got to support the new carbon taxes.
[01:39:22.106 --> 01:39:23.546]  You've got to support new wars.
[01:39:24.487 --> 01:39:25.147]  You've got to...
[01:39:26.630 --> 01:39:29.452]  Support more and more bailouts of the bankers.
[01:39:29.492 --> 01:39:33.334]  And they say on the news, you know, the public doesn't like the $700 million being kept.
[01:39:33.394 --> 01:39:37.897]  They don't mention that it's secret, that they won't tell anybody where it's being held, or that it's $8.5 trillion.
[01:39:38.317 --> 01:39:52.546]  But, you know, we have to do this, and so, you know, we better go along with Obama, because, you know, he's got the group of experts that know how to fix this crisis, when it's the same group of experts, like Timothy Geithner, who engineered the whole thing.
[01:39:54.047 --> 01:39:55.588]  And who's above the law and doesn't pay taxes.
[01:39:56.516 --> 01:39:58.700]  And was told he didn't pay taxes and said, I screw you.
[01:39:59.741 --> 01:40:03.167]  Just like 65% or more of Congress every year doesn't pay income tax.
[01:40:03.387 --> 01:40:03.948]  They just go, why?
[01:40:04.008 --> 01:40:04.328]  Why?
[01:40:04.469 --> 01:40:05.009]  We rule!
[01:40:07.532 --> 01:40:09.673]  So, they're going to build him up.
[01:40:09.733 --> 01:40:11.753]  I believe the stock market's going to go up for a while.
[01:40:11.993 --> 01:40:14.674]  People are going to say, oh my God, he's really fixing things.
[01:40:14.734 --> 01:40:18.175]  We've got to get behind everything he says and everything he does.
[01:40:18.795 --> 01:40:24.296]  We've got to support the carbon tax on all CO2, methane, and every other carbon put off by life forms in every industry.
[01:40:24.336 --> 01:40:25.437]  We've got to put taxes on it.
[01:40:25.697 --> 01:40:26.617]  We've got to regulate it.
[01:40:26.977 --> 01:40:28.617]  We've got to have a guest worker program.
[01:40:28.877 --> 01:40:34.479]  We've got to have increases in foreign aid to help the starving, but really it's to euthanize them, sterilize them.
[01:40:35.359 --> 01:40:53.264]  uh... forced abortions uh... you know we've gotta get behind just like pat robertson they're all lining up the comic books the culture the media fox news pat robertson saying socialism will save us obama is the answer we've got nothing will stop him it is of the lord god told me
[01:40:54.949 --> 01:40:59.353]  And then the media, with the images of just smiling happy crowds every day, just going, Obama!
[01:40:59.873 --> 01:41:00.373]  Obama!
[01:41:00.654 --> 01:41:13.904]  Just creating this hysteria, bandwagon of, stuff's real bad, stuff's real bad, but the news says that Obama's got a plan to fix it, and if I just do whatever he says, if I follow whatever he says, it's all gonna be fixed.
[01:41:14.795 --> 01:41:28.524]  If I just do whatever Barack Obama says... And folks, making this film about Obama, working on it every day, I mean, just the depths of how evil he is, how evil his handlers are, the horrible things they're planning, how they lie, how they spin, how they break all their promises.
[01:41:28.804 --> 01:41:33.367]  This is going to be a great betrayal, a false hope, this huge Obama deception.
[01:41:33.687 --> 01:41:48.075]  But again, within that is another deception, because it's all about him as if he actually runs something, instead of the shadow government that now is at shadow with NorthCon and the ten FEMA regions openly announcing they're putting troops on the streets and spies and tattletale squads.
[01:41:48.095 --> 01:41:59.221]  And they're going to have lots of attempts on Obama's life and the dear leaders trying to fix the economy and trying to help the children, but terrorists try to strike again and, my God, they use guns and, you know what, Obama's got to restrict the guns.
[01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:09.694]  And then Obama's openly announcing, and his new Attorney General's openly announcing that they're trying to pass a law in Congress where they can ban by executive fiat through the Attorney General any guns he wants.
[01:42:10.155 --> 01:42:11.115]  All semi-autos.
[01:42:12.236 --> 01:42:13.697]  I read the bill yesterday on air.
[01:42:14.437 --> 01:42:15.338]  It's happening!
[01:42:15.798 --> 01:42:17.839]  National gun registration's been introduced!
[01:42:18.219 --> 01:42:20.661]  And it still doesn't matter, we've just gotta do it!
[01:42:21.001 --> 01:42:21.922]  He's saving us!
[01:42:22.847 --> 01:42:23.768]  And they call it change.
[01:42:24.148 --> 01:42:24.728]  More government.
[01:42:24.768 --> 01:42:25.489]  More regulation.
[01:42:25.529 --> 01:42:26.049]  More control.
[01:42:26.109 --> 01:42:27.049]  More bureaucracies.
[01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:28.210]  More welfare.
[01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:29.291]  To bankrupt the states.
[01:42:29.591 --> 01:42:30.912]  To get everybody on the government tit.
[01:42:30.932 --> 01:42:32.293]  To get everybody under their control.
[01:42:32.313 --> 01:42:36.755]  You know, I promise to get to this 9-11 news.
[01:42:36.775 --> 01:42:37.876]  So we'll do that in the final second.
[01:42:37.896 --> 01:42:39.377]  I don't have time to get to all your calls.
[01:42:39.397 --> 01:42:41.578]  For everybody that's holding, call back tomorrow.
[01:42:41.598 --> 01:42:42.459]  I'll go to the head of the line.
[01:42:42.799 --> 01:42:43.459]  I'm going to come back.
[01:42:43.479 --> 01:42:44.600]  Get into 9-11 truth.
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:46.381]  And the way it's being attacked.
[01:42:46.401 --> 01:42:49.323]  And I'm going to spend more time on this later in the week with Daniel Sinjada.
[01:42:49.343 --> 01:42:49.743]  Stay with us.
[01:42:54.424 --> 01:43:07.137]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:43:07.578 --> 01:43:14.345]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:43:14.665 --> 01:43:18.248]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:43:18.608 --> 01:43:21.791]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:43:22.031 --> 01:43:23.752]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:43:23.792 --> 01:43:29.537]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[01:43:29.937 --> 01:43:33.520]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at Infowars.com.
[01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:33.900]  I think so.
[01:43:54.207 --> 01:43:56.930]  Are you one of the millions of sinus and allergy sufferers?
[01:43:57.130 --> 01:43:58.251]  Is your nose stuffed up?
[01:43:58.271 --> 01:44:02.436]  Do you experience sinus headaches, allergy symptoms, infections, or post-nasal drip?
[01:44:02.456 --> 01:44:07.040]  Does your treatment improve your body's disease-fighting function, or are you simply treating the symptoms?
[01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:17.511]  The Sinuplus Elite Advanced Sinus Irrigation System effectively cleanses your sinuses and upper airways of all fungi, bacteria, and pathogens, and clears your sinuses gently and pleasantly.
[01:44:17.551 --> 01:44:18.051]  We're good to go.
[01:44:47.551 --> 01:44:47.951]  I think so.
[01:45:10.538 --> 01:45:13.720]  Without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:45:13.941 --> 01:45:19.825]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:45:20.085 --> 01:45:24.468]  And germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[01:45:24.748 --> 01:45:32.774]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[01:45:32.954 --> 01:45:39.599]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of healthcare.
[01:45:43.567 --> 01:45:44.569]  We're good to go.
[01:45:56.030 --> 01:46:07.834]  Okay, I want to move fast because we're almost out of time, but I was just looking at the screen earlier, another article about, you know, school superintendents all across the country say they're implementing the Obama system in their schools.
[01:46:08.714 --> 01:46:14.876]  But see, they couldn't say the federal government system really under federal control in the schools, public schools, government indoctrination centers.
[01:46:17.628 --> 01:46:18.908]  And so they say, oh, it's Obama.
[01:46:18.928 --> 01:46:27.170]  They make him the superstar, the rock star, the super Michael Jordan, the Arnold Schwarzenegger, on steroids, pun intended, culturally.
[01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:36.012]  And then they attach the whole New World Order train to him, and then he is the front man, drags it through, with the public going like this, because the economy's falling apart and they're scared.
[01:46:36.552 --> 01:46:37.893]  And they're going, Obama!
[01:46:38.473 --> 01:46:39.413]  Obama!
[01:46:39.913 --> 01:46:40.833]  Obama!
[01:46:40.873 --> 01:46:43.494]  Just bowing down like it's to some idol.
[01:46:45.285 --> 01:46:48.867]  And then they implement the total federal takeover, the youth brigades, all of it.
[01:46:49.648 --> 01:46:50.809]  We're in deep trouble, folks.
[01:46:51.489 --> 01:46:53.451]  But we may still have time to turn this around.
[01:46:54.111 --> 01:47:01.516]  Because they admit within a few months, 150 days max, the public is going to turn against him and see that it's a fraud, just like they did with Bush.
[01:47:03.277 --> 01:47:04.518]  And that's our job to do that.
[01:47:04.999 --> 01:47:06.660]  To put out the issues, to put out the facts.
[01:47:07.060 --> 01:47:08.281]  Now I want to play this clip
[01:47:09.773 --> 01:47:15.334]  It's from a new A&E show, FBI show, portrays 9-11 truthers as dope-smoking terrorists.
[01:47:15.534 --> 01:47:17.995]  This guy is buying grenade launchers to kill U.S.
[01:47:18.035 --> 01:47:18.315]  troops.
[01:47:18.855 --> 01:47:20.036]  He's a 9-11 truther.
[01:47:20.396 --> 01:47:22.056]  They also play subtle race card.
[01:47:22.076 --> 01:47:22.936]  They do it both ways.
[01:47:23.336 --> 01:47:27.878]  You know, he's a, you know, kind of a gangsterish black guy who wants to kill the troops.
[01:47:28.198 --> 01:47:29.518]  And he's also smoking pots.
[01:47:29.538 --> 01:47:31.258]  The image is terrorist smoke pot.
[01:47:31.639 --> 01:47:32.359]  Terrorists are 9-11 truthers.
[01:47:33.539 --> 01:47:45.508]  And this is an A&E program put out by Hearst Publishing that owns it, the fathers of yellow journalism, and this ties into the Violent Radicalization Act, all these national TV hosts saying 9-11 truth-tellers are terrorists with no incidents, no evidence.
[01:47:45.728 --> 01:47:47.910]  We're exposing the establishment of the terrorists.
[01:47:48.730 --> 01:48:07.254]  And this is why the Senate and the House have said we're dangerous, we've got to be dealt with, our free speech has got to be restricted, because if we expose that they carried out the terror, they have to stop staging terror attacks, and that takes their tool of hitting us with a terror attack and then posing as the savior and saying that guy did it so they can direct us into some new country to attack.
[01:48:08.474 --> 01:48:09.154]  So that's what they're doing.
[01:48:09.194 --> 01:48:10.255]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[01:48:11.175 --> 01:48:12.695]  Hey, you here for my launch cards?
[01:48:13.035 --> 01:48:16.756]  Look, man, if I could just get what I came for and, you know, I'll be on my way.
[01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:20.173]  You a truther or a sheep?
[01:48:21.454 --> 01:48:25.539]  What?
[01:48:25.559 --> 01:48:27.341]  9-11 was a false flag operation, man.
[01:48:27.942 --> 01:48:28.402]  Wake up!
[01:48:29.083 --> 01:48:31.125]  A self-inflicted wound to control the masses.
[01:48:31.406 --> 01:48:32.427]  You know there was no planes.
[01:48:33.027 --> 01:48:35.350]  All done with holograms and CGI.
[01:48:35.590 --> 01:48:38.574]  Yeah, man, look, if I can just... What's your rush, bro?
[01:48:49.562 --> 01:48:53.804]  So, and you've seen the national drug policy ads where if you smoke marijuana, you're aiding Al-Qaeda.
[01:48:53.824 --> 01:49:00.246]  So it's multi-propaganda rolled in here, and then notice the government angle I told you years ago they were going to attack us with.
[01:49:00.707 --> 01:49:02.127]  Is the CGI no-plainers?
[01:49:03.388 --> 01:49:04.368]  That's an operation.
[01:49:04.548 --> 01:49:08.610]  Now you've got idiots that are forced to multiply, that don't know they're being controlled, that are pushing that.
[01:49:09.525 --> 01:49:19.175]  And so all over TV, all over media, they're inserting, just like they insert that homeschoolers abuse their children and homeschoolers dumb their children down, when it's actually statistically the opposite.
[01:49:19.876 --> 01:49:28.304]  Just like they tell you that guns are illegal, when they're not illegal, but somebody's at your house cleaning your carpet and they see a gun case and freak out and call the police on you in Texas.
[01:49:29.225 --> 01:49:38.989]  Or people see that somebody's homeschooling and they call the CPS on them saying homeschooling's illegal because they have sitcoms and dramas where they just suddenly go, you know it's a new world order and we gotta get rid of this homeschooling.
[01:49:40.369 --> 01:49:43.591]  They just inject this, you're being attacked by propaganda.
[01:49:43.611 --> 01:49:47.112]  I mean, even if you don't believe this show and don't like me, what is the point
[01:49:48.627 --> 01:49:50.770]  In wanting to be conned and being screwed.
[01:49:51.932 --> 01:49:53.674]  Everything we told you came true.
[01:49:53.734 --> 01:49:55.897]  We've been right about almost everything, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:56.157 --> 01:49:57.799]  We've laid out the facts historically.
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:02.085]  We know what's going on and we're doing our best to fight the New World Order.
[01:50:02.245 --> 01:50:03.367]  And we need your help, listeners.

[01:50:21.816 --> 01:50:26.418]  The public is waking up to the new world order, but they're getting conned by Obama, but only for a season.

[01:50:43.953 --> 01:50:45.515]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:45.635 --> 01:50:50.361]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:50.381 --> 01:50:53.144]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:50:53.344 --> 01:50:56.208]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:50:56.388 --> 01:51:01.114]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:51:01.334 --> 01:51:02.214]  If you simply prepare.
[01:51:02.454 --> 01:51:05.376]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:05.696 --> 01:51:12.599]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:51:12.719 --> 01:51:15.820]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:16.220]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:51:18.641 --> 01:51:20.882]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:51:21.102 --> 01:51:27.186]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-stride, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:51:27.366 --> 01:51:31.128]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:51:31.148 --> 01:51:32.629]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:51:32.669 --> 01:51:33.089]  Take action today.
[01:51:33.129 --> 01:51:34.910]  The first step is getting storable food.
