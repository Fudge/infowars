[00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:08.852]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.492 --> 00:00:10.293]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.073 --> 00:00:11.953]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:16.254]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:20.935]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.416 --> 00:00:26.657]  We've got William Lewis, the filmmaker of Camp FEMA, did a great job.
[00:00:26.957 --> 00:00:28.177]  We have the film here.
[00:00:28.197 --> 00:00:30.358]  I'm gonna ask him what a few clips are he thinks we should play.
[00:00:31.707 --> 00:00:33.669]  Audio for the radio, video for the video listeners.
[00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:36.971]  Kind of a first sneak peek as well about just the trailer you just saw.
[00:00:37.452 --> 00:00:45.618]  Coming up, Blast Hour, William Lewis will continue to be with us with Gary Franchi, the producer of Camp FEMA.
[00:00:46.059 --> 00:01:00.070]  We'll tell you all about the film and they're really experts on FEMA camps, so am I. So we'll take your questions on FEMA camps, on the police state, on the cashless society control grid, tie it into the no-buy list for gun owners, tie it into the no-fly list,
[00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:08.083]  The shutting down of garage sales, the Feds going after eBay, this total control of the economy.
[00:01:09.284 --> 00:01:10.144]  That's all coming up.
[00:01:10.544 --> 00:01:13.685]  Right now, let's go to Jean, Anti-Federalist Andrew, Pat, Wayne, and others.
[00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:14.986]  Jean, you're on the air.
[00:01:15.026 --> 00:01:15.646]  Thanks for holding.
[00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:24.829]  Okay, what I want to mention is on September 25th and 26th, there's a meeting of the G20 in Pittsburgh.
[00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.690]  And they're saying no, no, no semi-automatic rifles allowed in the city at that time.
[00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.031]  In fact, that's in my stack, the print assault weapons ban for G20.
[00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:35.532]  I want to cover that.
[00:01:35.552 --> 00:01:36.232]  Go ahead, ma'am.
[00:01:36.792 --> 00:01:41.013]  Yeah, on Truthdig.org, there's a big story about it.
[00:01:41.053 --> 00:01:54.137]  But the other thing I want to mention, her name is Naomi Wolf, has done a very good, it was earlier than your material, but she details the tense
[00:01:55.117 --> 00:02:00.440]  Which a government will use to go from democracy to a fascist state.
[00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:03.442]  Yeah, we've had her on and she's been critical of Obama now.
[00:02:03.842 --> 00:02:07.765]  She's a Rhodes Scholar and she goes over the 10 steps.
[00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:09.546]  Yes, and it's all exactly what's happening.
[00:02:10.667 --> 00:02:20.513]  Yeah, and I think that this G20 meeting on the 25th and 26th of September in Pittsburgh may be the event that they're all getting geared up for.
[00:02:22.068 --> 00:02:27.814]  Well, we're going to get guest on about the G20 Assault Weapons Ban, which is all semi-automatic handguns and rifles.
[00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:33.559]  What they do is, see, for special events they say you don't have your rights, then they expand it out to everything.
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.101]  Anything else, Jean?
[00:02:36.442 --> 00:02:44.490]  No, I'm just, I'm thinking of going there, but I'm looking at this picture of the paramilitary being there, and I'm wondering if I'm going to get
[00:02:45.293 --> 00:02:47.354]  Yeah, well that's part of the intimidation.
[00:02:47.414 --> 00:02:56.356]  That's why they hire provocateurs to attack the police so they can rubber bullet the whole innocent crowd to then scare everybody into not going to political events.
[00:02:56.836 --> 00:02:58.957]  They've been caught in Denver last year.
[00:02:58.997 --> 00:03:00.517]  It's in the Obama Deception Extras.
[00:03:00.857 --> 00:03:02.878]  Admitted, the police attacked their own cops.
[00:03:03.238 --> 00:03:07.899]  They were caught in Canada a year and a half ago at the North American Union Summit.
[00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.239]  Police attacking police.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.360]  These are hardcore criminals and they never get in trouble for it.
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.841]  Ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[00:03:13.861 --> 00:03:14.521]  Yeah, here it is.
[00:03:15.868 --> 00:03:19.489]  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, assault weapon ban for G20 summit.
[00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:23.790]  Gun debate springs from city proposal to control protesters.
[00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.391]  Of course, concealed carry people are everywhere with guns, which is even more dangerous, but they don't care.
[00:03:29.671 --> 00:03:32.592]  They don't want to see people with guns out in the open.
[00:03:33.572 --> 00:03:38.193]  Because that breaks the spell that guns are illegal.
[00:03:39.784 --> 00:03:48.649]  See, they run these ads and billboards saying, report illegal guns, and all the shows are based in New York or Chicago, the dramas, where a cop finds a gun in somebody's house and takes them to jail for it.
[00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.931]  Weak-minded people see that and think guns are illegal in Arizona and Texas.
[00:03:54.632 --> 00:03:56.393]  When they're only illegal in D.C.
[00:03:56.433 --> 00:03:57.674]  and New York and Chicago.
[00:04:01.676 --> 00:04:05.758]  Pittsburgh short-lived ban on assault weapons quashed by Attorney General
[00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:13.672]  The General Assembly of 94 is still in the city's books and it may get new life under legislation driven by the next month's G20 Summit.
[00:04:14.113 --> 00:04:24.778]  A little notice clause in the proposed ordinance written by Mayor Luke Ravenstahl's administration to keep protesters from thwarting police crowd control efforts invokes the default assault weapons ban.
[00:04:25.258 --> 00:04:31.601]  The clause says no person shall possess an array of items including 37 contraband weapons listed on the ban.
[00:04:32.002 --> 00:04:32.362]  So see,
[00:04:33.638 --> 00:04:36.040]  This has been thrown out before, but they're criminals, they don't care.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.204]  For the purpose of defeating lawful removal by police.
[00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:47.887]  It's effect is a matter of debate.
[00:04:48.867 --> 00:04:53.230]  So, again, under national or local emergencies, they say you don't have a right to your guns.
[00:04:53.851 --> 00:04:59.014]  Because they're tyrant scum working for offshore banks, raping us out of existence.
[00:05:00.424 --> 00:05:07.886]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do?
[00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:13.427]  You can buy it at hereiswhatyoudo.net as an e-book for $6 or the book for $10.
[00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:16.928]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:05:17.208 --> 00:05:23.110]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.911]  This book will work for anyone.
[00:05:25.071 --> 00:05:27.332]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:05:27.553 --> 00:05:32.936]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:05:33.176 --> 00:05:34.997]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:05:35.257 --> 00:05:36.638]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:05:36.998 --> 00:05:39.260]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.903]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:05:44.263 --> 00:05:47.645]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[00:05:47.965 --> 00:05:50.106]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:05:51.087 --> 00:05:52.528]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:05:52.968 --> 00:05:53.628]  One last time.
[00:05:54.008 --> 00:05:55.689]  It's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:06:00.751 --> 00:06:02.772]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:06:02.912 --> 00:06:05.313]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:07.554]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:06:07.594 --> 00:06:09.135]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:06:09.155 --> 00:06:10.796]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:06:10.876 --> 00:06:13.717]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:06:13.757 --> 00:06:17.398]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:06:27.047 --> 00:06:31.838]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.021]  An inside job.
[00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:36.796]  How dare you!
[00:06:38.337 --> 00:06:43.201]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:06:43.222 --> 00:06:46.024]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:06:46.124 --> 00:06:52.549]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:55.172]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now.
[00:06:55.432 --> 00:06:57.434]  Or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[00:06:57.694 --> 00:07:00.176]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:08.724]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[00:07:08.964 --> 00:07:13.226]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:18.309]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[00:07:18.609 --> 00:07:25.753]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[00:07:26.073 --> 00:07:30.474]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[00:07:30.754 --> 00:07:36.336]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:07:36.776 --> 00:07:43.298]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.

[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.281]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com or call 269-409-1776.
[00:07:55.562 --> 00:08:10.596]  Well, he's produced five or six big films I can think of that have had incalculable effect out there on the web, like America Under Siege.
[00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:11.997]  The list just goes on and on.
[00:08:24.375 --> 00:08:35.324]  In Plain Sight, Beyond Treason, Washington You're Fired, his film about the big bubble, about the economy, we sell that at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:35.704 --> 00:08:44.491]  But up on screen at InfoWars.com, we have a headline article, William Lewis' Camp FEMA, now available at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:50.176]  And I'm telling you, this is William Lewis' most powerful, hard-hitting film.
[00:08:51.096 --> 00:08:52.818]  And I consulted on it,
[00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.731]  As you notice, it says featuring.
[00:08:54.751 --> 00:08:57.754]  I'm the first person featured, which I'm proud to be featured in this.
[00:08:58.255 --> 00:09:03.600]  Going over all the facts, going over the evidence, the real camps, the congressional record, where they are.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.703]  Not all the government's straw men are fake camps, they go point out.
[00:09:08.124 --> 00:09:11.407]  Alex Jones, John Stettmiller, Catherine...
[00:09:13.579 --> 00:09:20.649]  Blish, I believe you pronounce it, Michael Bagnerik, Chuck Baldwin, Constitution Party presidential candidate, very credible, and a lot of others.
[00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:29.942]  And it's Camp FEMA, it ships the 18th of September, so about 18 days from now.
[00:09:30.962 --> 00:09:36.847]  I think William's going to let us all a few days before, because we're one of the big places to get it at InfoWars.com.
[00:09:37.107 --> 00:09:40.189]  Start shipping it so folks get it on the 18th or around the 18th.
[00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.470]  On DVD.
[00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:42.491]  DVD premiere.
[00:09:42.771 --> 00:09:43.652]  Have viewing parties.
[00:09:43.712 --> 00:09:44.473]  Show it to people.
[00:09:44.813 --> 00:09:54.521]  We can stop them if they're able to see this film, because it shows how they're introducing it, how they're selling it, how the camps are good and for your safety and a wonderful thing.
[00:09:55.495 --> 00:10:03.061]  We also have it comboed up with a new film just released today, New World Order, on DVD that I'm the main person in and also consulted on.
[00:10:03.722 --> 00:10:08.025]  This on DVD with a whole bunch of extras, a giant group of extras.
[00:10:08.065 --> 00:10:09.226]  It's a film in its own right.
[00:10:10.203 --> 00:10:13.064]  Uh, as well, so you definitely want to get New World Order.
[00:10:13.264 --> 00:10:19.267]  All of this is available at InfoWars.com today or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:10:19.287 --> 00:10:26.030]  Now, for the next hour and 50 minutes, we're joined by William Lewis.
[00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.831]  Coming up in the last hour, Gary Franchi, the producer, joins us.
[00:10:29.271 --> 00:10:33.433]  They traveled all over the country to real FEMA camps, talked to congressmen about FEMA camps.
[00:10:33.493 --> 00:10:34.453]  It's just an amazing film.
[00:10:36.014 --> 00:10:45.697]  And I didn't talk to William before the show, but I'm going to find out during a break if there's a clip or two in the film that he thinks we should play here today, not just the trailers.
[00:10:46.677 --> 00:10:51.939]  But William, very exciting, and I just want to say great job on Camp FEMA.
[00:10:52.619 --> 00:10:55.020]  Hey man, I appreciate it, and thanks for having me on.
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:59.321]  You know, you have a large part in making Camp FEMA, so
[00:11:00.526 --> 00:11:07.687]  You know, don't forget to thank yourself, and I thank you as well, and I think that once people get a chance to see this, they're going to be coming back to you for some more information.
[00:11:09.228 --> 00:11:14.408]  You know, this was a million different pieces that we had to whittle down to about a thousand and put together.
[00:11:15.069 --> 00:11:27.811]  So, obviously, everything that all of our guests said in the documentary when we were shooting didn't make it in there, but I think that you'll notice you and, what, John Stattmiller, Katherine Bleich, a couple of others there,
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:45.050]  Yeah, I've got to say, Stattmiller, I've never really seen him do TV.
[00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:46.751]  He comes across really good on camera.
[00:11:47.311 --> 00:11:52.675]  So, I mean, again, the film is, you want to hand something to somebody and say, here's the proof of the FEMA camps.
[00:11:53.075 --> 00:11:56.077]  You want to give something to Glenn Beck or go to these tea parties, this is it.
[00:11:56.698 --> 00:12:04.484]  Now, I know you're mass-producing it right now, and we've already gotten some in, but we're going to get the big group in in about a week and a half or so.
[00:12:04.864 --> 00:12:09.127]  When can I start shipping these so people get them on the 18th?
[00:12:09.268 --> 00:12:12.370]  Or, William, will we be shipping these on the 18th?
[00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:21.657]  Well, it really depends on the manufacturer, and we've gotten good news that they're ahead of schedule, so you may actually be able to ship those out a little bit ahead of time.
[00:12:22.984 --> 00:12:24.325]  I can't guarantee it right at this point.
[00:12:24.365 --> 00:12:28.646]  I've got to wait a little bit further along in production, so that I know exactly what the ship date is.
[00:12:29.126 --> 00:12:36.088]  But, you know, you guys are getting a special drop shipment right to your location, so you might probably have those a couple of days ahead of everybody else.
[00:12:38.148 --> 00:12:42.290]  I don't see any problems in selling them early, or shipping them out early, or doing any of that.
[00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:43.430]  No, no, you've always done that.
[00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:45.751]  You've got, is it five or six films under your belt?
[00:12:46.951 --> 00:12:47.491]  This is seven.
[00:12:48.175 --> 00:12:48.616]  Seven!
[00:12:49.296 --> 00:12:49.656]  Seven.
[00:12:49.757 --> 00:12:51.378]  So, established filmmaker.
[00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:56.262]  First thing you ever did is you contacted me when I was making films of my own and said, hey, I'd like to come work with you.
[00:12:56.302 --> 00:12:58.404]  And I said, hey, it's me and my wife and one other guy.
[00:12:58.464 --> 00:12:59.645]  Sorry, I don't have the money to hire you.
[00:13:00.065 --> 00:13:02.868]  But I'm glad I didn't have the money to hire you because you're off on your own.
[00:13:03.328 --> 00:13:07.252]  That's what we need is lots of great people out making their own films.
[00:13:07.312 --> 00:13:09.814]  And William, I'm telling you, it's not just that I'm in this film.
[00:13:10.414 --> 00:13:12.655]  I think you've asked me a few times being others and I was too busy.
[00:13:13.055 --> 00:13:15.556]  I'm in this because I didn't have the time to make a FEMA camp film.
[00:13:15.997 --> 00:13:17.317]  I advised, I consulted.
[00:13:17.677 --> 00:13:22.219]  You just did an incredible job and you've really knocked it out of the park on this one.
[00:13:22.299 --> 00:13:23.220]  All the films were great.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.422]  I mean, look, folks, Camp FEMA is a real accomplishment.
[00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:28.942]  This has got to be seen.
[00:13:29.463 --> 00:13:30.463]  I haven't asked you this, though.
[00:13:30.503 --> 00:13:32.984]  Where are you about people making copies if they don't sell it?
[00:13:33.024 --> 00:13:33.304]  I know, uh,
[00:13:35.211 --> 00:13:38.132]  I've tried to go buy my own films or sell them on Amazon.
[00:13:38.152 --> 00:13:47.595]  We're about to start that and I can't because people claim they're their films and so I'm having to now write them letters and say you can't sell my films on Amazon because they're claiming that they own my films.
[00:13:47.935 --> 00:13:58.899]  She can get into trouble doing that but what I mean how is it gonna work kind of a blind eye of folks are handing these out to people because I want this film to go supernova on the streets William.
[00:13:59.929 --> 00:14:00.569]  Yeah, I understand.
[00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:07.554]  And, you know, we haven't put it on the website yet, and this is mainly because we just don't have the funds to make the duplications yet.
[00:14:07.614 --> 00:14:19.763]  But as soon as we start getting them coming in, we'll be able to offer really inexpensive, you know, Patriot Packs, where you can get 10 or 100 of these things at a time at a very good discount.
[00:14:20.623 --> 00:14:25.567]  And, you know, we hope to kind of go that way, the way Aaron Russo did his release.
[00:14:25.607 --> 00:14:27.268]  So I think this will
[00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:29.992]  I think this will probably be the best way.
[00:14:30.573 --> 00:14:32.276]  If you get a copy of the DVD...
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.381]  You're welcome to duplicate it for yourself and your immediate family members.
[00:14:38.421 --> 00:14:39.402]  That's not a problem at all.
[00:14:39.922 --> 00:14:43.683]  William, I've got a copy of the film coming up.
[00:14:43.743 --> 00:14:45.463]  Just start thinking about it now during the break.
[00:14:45.483 --> 00:14:45.783]  Tell me.
[00:14:46.063 --> 00:14:48.724]  So we can play a minute or two clip a couple times.
[00:14:49.104 --> 00:14:50.144]  Tell me a good spot.
[00:14:50.164 --> 00:14:51.645]  I mean, there's a lot of good spots here.
[00:14:52.085 --> 00:14:58.527]  Maybe when we're introducing the modern FEMA camps, a clip or two that we can play of the film for the first time for people here today.
[00:14:58.567 --> 00:15:02.848]  But for new listeners who don't know about the FEMA camps, tell folks about your journey
[00:15:04.091 --> 00:15:04.772]  Well, this journey began...
[00:15:17.515 --> 00:15:34.498]  Over 10 years ago, back when I was just beginning to start learning about searching on the internet for these type of things, roughly 1995 or 6, and back then, even then, the information you could find on FEMA camps on the internet, and they weren't called FEMA camps, but
[00:15:35.058 --> 00:15:35.418]  We're good to go.
[00:15:57.952 --> 00:15:58.552]  You know, a problem.
[00:15:58.993 --> 00:16:03.476]  Researching those types of things and putting them into a documentary, if I can prove them, we couldn't prove any of that stuff.
[00:16:03.496 --> 00:16:07.118]  That's why I say there's a million things that we have to whittle down to about a thousand.
[00:16:07.158 --> 00:16:07.799]  What's credible?
[00:16:07.839 --> 00:16:08.599]  What can we prove?
[00:16:08.939 --> 00:16:15.604]  That's why this documentary is so unique, because there's nothing in it that can in any way be disproved and knock a hole in something else.
[00:16:15.964 --> 00:16:25.210]  You know, the entire argument that is laid out, when people see this for the first time, they're going to for the first time realize that it's no longer an internet rumor.
[00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:26.231]  It never has been.
[00:16:27.338 --> 00:16:37.583]  All right, but you know, the whole process of getting here, you know, Gary and I teamed up on this about a year and a half ago, just shooting footage and collecting everything we needed.
[00:16:37.623 --> 00:16:41.824]  This is the first time we've had actors in a production.
[00:16:41.844 --> 00:16:47.567]  So Gary's niece, Christina Reese, plays our young victim.
[00:16:48.467 --> 00:16:56.771]  And I think this is kind of a different emotional catch to this particular documentary, which is why I think a lot of people are going to
[00:16:57.341 --> 00:16:58.001]  We're good to go.
[00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:28.572]  15 or 20 minutes of the documentary and it really is a journey down the dark side of government and where this is not likely to happen.
[00:17:28.592 --> 00:17:43.335]  Where this is going with the legislation that we're talking about that legitimizes these FEMA camps and the mindset of our leaders in Washington showing the legislation that they want to pass that demonizes people like you and me for simply speaking out about government policy.
[00:17:45.156 --> 00:17:47.818]  That's right, you can't just cover FEMA camps.
[00:17:47.838 --> 00:18:00.449]  You've got to show all the other legislation, the attacks on free speech, the government saying our number one threat is gun owners and veterans and we need to arrest them, and the police pulling veterans over and Ron Paul supporters.
[00:18:00.889 --> 00:18:06.774]  We just had a lady last hour, it happened to, and they said you got a short haircut, Ron Paul sticker, you may be terrorist.
[00:18:08.104 --> 00:18:09.965]  Yeah, I mean it's very up to date.
[00:18:10.005 --> 00:18:15.687]  People will notice news clips and things in this documentary that may only be a week or two old simply because
[00:18:29.659 --> 00:18:32.901]  You know, as we were finishing up the documentary, there were several things that broke.
[00:18:33.581 --> 00:18:35.303]  The Hal Turner story, for instance.
[00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:43.248]  We were lucky enough to be able to get that in there so that we could show people that the COINTEL operations from the 1950s, 60s, and 70s never really ended.
[00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:44.829]  They were just continued under different names.
[00:18:48.135 --> 00:18:58.904]  The Glenn Beck segment, I don't know if you really got a chance to see that or not, but I don't think it was in the first edit that we sent you, but the Glenn Beck segment turned out to be just absolutely hilarious.
[00:18:59.344 --> 00:19:13.156]  I mean, it is funny to watch, which is the reason why we had to actually stick it after the credits, so people who get the film and you don't see Glenn Beck in there, you have to wait until the credits finish and then the Glenn Beck segment begins, and we did that mainly because
[00:19:13.696 --> 00:19:14.997]  It just totally broke the mood.
[00:19:15.538 --> 00:19:21.162]  It just totally broke the spell that we were trying to set for everybody because you're literally laughing on the floor when you see this.
[00:19:21.182 --> 00:19:35.712]  No, but that's smart because it's a serious film with all the proof, with congressmen admitting it, with all the documents, all their own admissions, people saying camps are good, not just people exposing camps, and then you cut to Beck lying and saying none of it exists.
[00:19:36.873 --> 00:19:37.353]  Exactly.
[00:19:39.155 --> 00:19:40.656]  William Lewis, amazing job.
[00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:45.117]  I want to talk about how the film starts, the Japanese, what happened to them.
[00:19:45.137 --> 00:19:47.419]  I want to open the phones up too.
[00:19:47.739 --> 00:19:52.103]  We're going to take the calls that have been holding and new callers on this subject at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:52.123 --> 00:19:52.524]  Stay with us.
[00:19:52.624 --> 00:19:54.465]  It's Camp FEMA with William Lewis, the director.
[00:20:00.998 --> 00:20:02.739]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:05.921]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[00:20:05.981 --> 00:20:07.922]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[00:20:08.222 --> 00:20:08.982]  Here's the story.
[00:20:09.202 --> 00:20:13.785]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:15.005]  Now here's the bad news.
[00:20:15.245 --> 00:20:20.088]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures.
[00:20:20.328 --> 00:20:22.169]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[00:20:22.449 --> 00:20:26.672]  Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[00:20:27.052 --> 00:20:32.256]  All this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in the healthcare services.
[00:20:32.556 --> 00:20:34.417]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[00:20:34.757 --> 00:20:43.463]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[00:20:43.763 --> 00:20:48.667]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[00:20:48.947 --> 00:20:52.870]  I recommend you visit this important new website at MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:55.832]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:01.000]  Good day.
[00:21:01.221 --> 00:21:02.802]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:21:03.022 --> 00:21:03.423]  September 17, 2009.
[00:21:03.503 --> 00:21:04.684]  Gold opened this morning at $1,017.10.
[00:21:04.724 --> 00:21:08.168]  A one ounce gold coin to be purchased for $1,045.60, $522.80 for a half ounce, or $261.40 for a quarter ounce.
[00:21:08.208 --> 00:21:08.648]  That's $1,045.60, $522.80, or $261.40.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:34.263]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[00:21:34.343 --> 00:21:35.344]  Is this capitalism?
[00:21:35.584 --> 00:21:42.966]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:43.186 --> 00:21:44.146]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:44.286 --> 00:21:48.427]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[00:21:48.627 --> 00:21:49.828]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.

[00:21:56.711 --> 00:22:00.213]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.914 --> 00:22:02.595]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:22:02.915 --> 00:22:06.377]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:22:06.537 --> 00:22:08.378]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:22:08.998 --> 00:22:11.760]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.981]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[00:22:16.084 --> 00:22:16.524]  We're good to go.
[00:22:46.107 --> 00:22:48.230]  Exclusive audio interviews and so much more.

[00:23:01.798 --> 00:23:03.659]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:23:03.779 --> 00:23:10.481]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:23:10.761 --> 00:23:18.924]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:24:17.726 --> 00:24:18.828]  Run on for a long time.
[00:24:18.968 --> 00:24:21.931]  The maker of Camp FEMA, William Lewis, is our guest.
[00:24:21.971 --> 00:24:26.616]  Now I know we have Anti-Federalists Andrew, Pat, Wayne, Vincent and others holding.
[00:24:27.037 --> 00:24:27.938]  You'll be all over the map.
[00:24:28.038 --> 00:24:30.561]  William Lewis is Anti-Globalist, Anti-New World Order.
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.722]  He researches this stuff, so he can talk about any subject.
[00:24:34.182 --> 00:24:36.184]  But you might, while you're at it, want to ask him.
[00:24:36.204 --> 00:24:38.806]  I mean, they went to the real FEMA centers.
[00:24:38.866 --> 00:24:40.668]  They went and showed the fake FEMA centers.
[00:24:40.728 --> 00:24:43.010]  They put a lot of work into this.
[00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.652]  William can answer a lot of questions.
[00:24:45.712 --> 00:24:47.053]  His perspective on camps.
[00:24:47.373 --> 00:24:48.754]  You can ask me my perspective.
[00:24:48.794 --> 00:24:51.717]  I think I'm probably one of the top experts out there.
[00:24:51.777 --> 00:24:54.299]  I've in-depth studied this for a long time.
[00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:56.941]  I could even predict how Beck was going to whitewash.
[00:24:59.639 --> 00:25:01.860]  We're fully aware of how these guys operate.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.762]  But we're going to take some calls right now to get more into the film of William Lewis coming up.
[00:25:06.222 --> 00:25:11.125]  Anti-Federalist from Georgia, here on the air with our guest, William Lewis, go ahead.
[00:25:11.145 --> 00:25:19.289]  Hey Alex, I have a few comments, unfortunately nothing specifically FEMA, but I just wanted to throw them out there real quick.
[00:25:20.089 --> 00:25:27.993]  The first thing is a great documentary about what's going wrong with the one-child policy in China, and it's called China's Stolen Babies.
[00:25:28.809 --> 00:25:38.114]  Also, tonight, I wanted the viewers and the listeners to know there's a special on 9-11 conspiracies on National Geographic at 9.
[00:25:38.754 --> 00:25:43.316]  Let me just add to that that, in fact, I had that in my stack and I took it home.
[00:25:43.516 --> 00:25:45.337]  Will you get Jason because he knows where it is.
[00:25:46.317 --> 00:25:55.622]  National Geographic has apologized about their previous film four years ago about why the towers collapsed, similar to the Nova special.
[00:25:56.530 --> 00:26:04.416]  I think theirs is called Why the Buildings Collapsed, Nova's Why the Towers Collapsed, using fake data about bad steel and fire melting it.
[00:26:04.456 --> 00:26:10.902]  They've now changed their story with a new whitewash they're going to unveil tonight, but they've been forced to apologize.
[00:26:11.282 --> 00:26:15.986]  But I still have these idiots telling me why the towers collapsed and using their baloney, but go ahead.
[00:26:17.605 --> 00:26:20.066]  No, I'm sure it'll be very interesting to see what they have to say.
[00:26:21.106 --> 00:26:23.027]  Also, I just got back from D.C.
[00:26:23.087 --> 00:26:31.009]  last week, and of course there was a lot of things I could say about my trip, but I did come back with some kind of flu, and I'm happy to say I'm over it.
[00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:41.873]  And there are schwatzikas all over the Federal Reserve Building, all around the, I don't know what you would call it, but the freezes, the stone carvings that
[00:26:42.619 --> 00:26:43.079]  Absolutely.
[00:26:43.099 --> 00:26:43.399]  In the car.
[00:27:03.001 --> 00:27:07.402]  Until 1940, American school children did the Hitler salute.
[00:27:07.782 --> 00:27:11.523]  You can Google, American school children do Hitler salute at all major high schools.
[00:27:11.543 --> 00:27:12.323]  You can show you L.A.
[00:27:12.363 --> 00:27:13.083]  high school doing it.
[00:27:13.863 --> 00:27:19.264]  And they put the fasci, the symbol of fascism, the bundle of sticks with the hatchet heads in the U.S.
[00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:19.605]  Senate.
[00:27:20.185 --> 00:27:22.965]  And we were going to go that way with eugenics and everything else.
[00:27:23.405 --> 00:27:24.366]  I appreciate your call.
[00:27:24.686 --> 00:27:26.026]  William Lewis, comments on that?
[00:27:26.046 --> 00:27:28.846]  Well, who says we didn't go that way?
[00:27:29.227 --> 00:27:31.367]  They just figured out a better way to disguise it.
[00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:33.850]  And that's all I'll add to that.
[00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:35.571]  Good point.
[00:27:35.751 --> 00:27:36.731]  Andrew in Canada.
[00:27:36.751 --> 00:27:38.412]  You're on the air with the maker of Camp FEMA.
[00:27:39.432 --> 00:27:40.352]  Hi Alex.
[00:27:40.412 --> 00:27:41.352]  I'm a first-time caller.
[00:27:41.372 --> 00:27:45.613]  I've been listening for just over a year now and I'd like to thank you for waking me up first of all.
[00:27:47.334 --> 00:27:59.357]  In Canada it's funny actually because Canadians are always apologizing for everything and I actually I've gotten to the point where I just say apology accepted when they're always apologizing but I'd like to apologize to everyone out there for not waking up sooner.
[00:28:00.951 --> 00:28:07.114]  It's a very traumatic experience to wake up, and I think that that should be discussed more.
[00:28:07.694 --> 00:28:14.156]  Especially, I mean, you know, it's literally like your world is turned upside down, and I'm through it now, and I get it.
[00:28:14.196 --> 00:28:18.378]  You were calling earlier, you were saying, oh, who out there, you know, can see the whole thing.
[00:28:18.418 --> 00:28:24.540]  I can see this, you know, big machine of eugenics, which, you know, it requires humans.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.861]  The humans are the gears and the cogs of this big machine, and they can't
[00:28:28.502 --> 00:28:33.966]  Go forward with any of this, unless people, you know, willingly are part of it.
[00:28:34.066 --> 00:28:39.409]  And I guess... And they're racing to put it in place right now, because they know their time is short.
[00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:42.692]  They know the people are waking up exponentially.
[00:28:43.232 --> 00:28:46.614]  But when you really face the horror, you're like, how could I not have been involved?
[00:28:46.634 --> 00:28:53.539]  And I had an epiphany a few days ago, and I'm going to hold you over if need be, Collar, because I want you to continue to make your point, Andrea, but I want to add this now.
[00:28:54.039 --> 00:28:54.740]  I had an epiphany.
[00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:58.272]  The elites at the very top are fully conscious.
[00:28:58.792 --> 00:29:00.033]  They know the master plan.
[00:29:00.073 --> 00:29:00.754]  They know what they're doing.
[00:29:00.794 --> 00:29:13.624]  But most of their minions, I mean even senators and people, are compartmentalized and are picked by the system because they'll go along and rationalize and even believe a lot of their own propaganda.
[00:29:15.125 --> 00:29:17.587]  And that's the thing is that it's not just
[00:29:18.422 --> 00:29:27.104]  That the good people aren't awake, bad people aren't awake, selfish people aren't awake to just what this world they're creating is.
[00:29:27.764 --> 00:29:35.826]  And so all this denial, all this rationalization, all this denying what's going on is destroying human society and our liberties and freedoms.
[00:29:35.846 --> 00:29:39.787]  I want to get William Lewis' comment on that statement, then go back to Andrew.
[00:29:40.087 --> 00:29:43.208]  When we come back, then Wayne, Vincent, Sam, Virgil, and others.
[00:29:43.508 --> 00:29:45.869]  We're talking about FEMA camps for the rest of the show.
[00:29:50.874 --> 00:29:53.857]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.798 --> 00:29:57.501]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.104 --> 00:30:03.705]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:04.106 --> 00:30:09.088]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.448 --> 00:30:11.169]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.489 --> 00:30:16.292]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.492 --> 00:30:17.453]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.673 --> 00:30:18.413]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.793 --> 00:30:20.394]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.674 --> 00:30:21.515]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.755 --> 00:30:23.816]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.956 --> 00:30:25.056]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.297 --> 00:30:26.637]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.817 --> 00:30:27.878]  If there's a quarantine,
[00:30:28.038 --> 00:30:29.199]  And you can't feed yourself?
[00:30:29.359 --> 00:30:31.882]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:32.082 --> 00:30:35.266]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.666 --> 00:30:39.170]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:40.492]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.712 --> 00:30:41.332]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.613 --> 00:30:42.534]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.734 --> 00:30:43.475]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.655 --> 00:30:44.476]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.736 --> 00:30:47.498]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.778 --> 00:30:49.979]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:49.999 --> 00:30:51.000]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:01.846 --> 00:31:07.172]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.873 --> 00:31:13.220]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:19.928]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:20.228 --> 00:31:22.069]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:22.209 --> 00:31:24.609]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:35.632]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:37.873 --> 00:31:39.154]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.534 --> 00:31:40.934]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:41.394 --> 00:31:47.616]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:56.063]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.563 --> 00:31:57.704]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:58.144 --> 00:31:59.404]  The people strike back.
[00:32:03.386 --> 00:32:05.967]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[00:32:06.454 --> 00:32:08.735]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[00:32:09.095 --> 00:32:12.415]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutroversal Foods.
[00:32:12.856 --> 00:32:19.217]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[00:32:19.537 --> 00:32:23.078]  Dig into our chili with cornmeal dumplings and you'll feel like a wealthy Texan.
[00:32:23.418 --> 00:32:27.379]  Or sip a cup of warm potato cheddar soup and be soothed on a cold rainy day.
[00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:28.420]  We're good to go!
[00:32:50.247 --> 00:32:51.868]  For decades, people exposed chemtrails.
[00:32:52.028 --> 00:32:52.948]  Scientists tested it.
[00:32:52.968 --> 00:32:54.428]  Fish and wildlife people tested it.
[00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:31.158]  We've now been flying around the country for an upcoming film interviewing mayors and fish and wildlife people and government scientists and climatologists and weather weapons experts who work for the federal government.
[00:33:32.699 --> 00:33:39.003]  One of them was the head of the Naval Weapons Facility, Naval Weapons Research Laboratory.
[00:33:39.083 --> 00:33:40.724]  I mean, the head of it!
[00:33:41.554 --> 00:33:42.555]  All of this is real.
[00:33:42.975 --> 00:33:43.676]  It's going on.
[00:33:43.716 --> 00:33:57.426]  And then they just come out after this and go, yeah, we are spraying barium salts and aluminum dioxide that causes brain damage in all creatures, including not just humans, but reptile and also birds.
[00:33:59.948 --> 00:34:02.050]  So the ornithologist should be concerned about that.
[00:34:04.153 --> 00:34:06.594]  And then now they just come on and go, yeah, we've been doing tests.
[00:34:07.174 --> 00:34:19.740]  All of this was a Department of Energy test and we're doing it with partners worldwide to manipulate the weather and we are practicing to knock out different types of weather to create floods and to create droughts and
[00:34:21.112 --> 00:34:25.115]  We're terraforming and they have government textbooks for school children.
[00:34:25.696 --> 00:34:33.222]  In the last three years have come out where they just, you know, in Missouri and Texas and California teach the kids, the government is spraying sunscreen.
[00:34:33.582 --> 00:34:36.484]  That's what those trails are to protect you from global warming.
[00:34:38.386 --> 00:34:41.008]  But then all the studies show it actually increases global warming.
[00:34:41.308 --> 00:34:43.190]  Because the ultraviolet just goes right through it.
[00:34:45.372 --> 00:34:47.513]  And then bounces back up and is captured.
[00:34:47.734 --> 00:34:48.914]  Look, it's insane.
[00:34:49.355 --> 00:34:50.536]  It's just like these FEMA camps.
[00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:53.390]  It's all hidden in plain view.
[00:34:55.331 --> 00:35:13.003]  And you wake up to this and you realize you're all part of a giant project with a scientific dictatorship playing God, and you just can't only care about baseball, or your church, or fishing anymore, or whatever it is, or two-stepping at the local bar.
[00:35:13.043 --> 00:35:13.783]  I don't know what you do.
[00:35:13.843 --> 00:35:21.228]  The point is, we better... I was talking to some pretty high-powered Hollywood people last week.
[00:35:22.213 --> 00:35:23.013]  When I was in L.A.
[00:35:23.073 --> 00:35:26.074]  on a project, and they said, yeah, how do you go back?
[00:35:27.515 --> 00:35:33.237]  How do you care about any of this petty stuff anymore once you know about the New World Order?
[00:35:33.477 --> 00:35:40.760]  They want to keep you caught up in left and right and black and white and male and female and straight and gay and all these little things they have us fighting over.
[00:35:42.561 --> 00:35:46.782]  Meanwhile, or North versus South or Chinese versus America.
[00:35:47.142 --> 00:35:51.004]  Meanwhile, the global corporations are playing all of us off against each other.
[00:35:55.803 --> 00:35:57.464]  And this is the issue.
[00:35:57.544 --> 00:36:01.007]  Everything else is a side issue to the world government and what they're doing.
[00:36:01.508 --> 00:36:08.793]  I want to go back to Wayne in Canada to finish the statement he was making, and then back to the director of Camp FEMA, William Lewis.
[00:36:08.813 --> 00:36:09.194]  Go ahead.
[00:36:09.214 --> 00:36:11.175]  It's Andrew Alex.
[00:36:11.776 --> 00:36:13.777]  Andrew in Canada.
[00:36:13.817 --> 00:36:14.338]  Wayne's next.
[00:36:14.378 --> 00:36:14.598]  Yeah.
[00:36:15.599 --> 00:36:17.320]  Well, I mean, doublespeak.
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.581]  I think it's a huge thing.
[00:36:18.681 --> 00:36:20.262]  It's everywhere.
[00:36:20.282 --> 00:36:23.765]  I think people really need to learn more to recognize the doublespeak.
[00:36:24.229 --> 00:36:30.890]  You know, for example, when the President comes out and says, you know, we are achieving our goals, he's not talking about the American people.
[00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:33.331]  He's talking about his cronies, his insiders.
[00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:36.152]  You know, he's talking about that team, the elites.
[00:36:36.712 --> 00:36:43.313]  And he's just saying it to you as if, you know, people, I guess, they're expected to think that they're part of it, but they're obviously not.
[00:36:43.873 --> 00:36:45.134]  And it's all over the place.
[00:36:45.174 --> 00:36:46.054]  The writing is on the wall.
[00:36:47.381 --> 00:36:49.782]  If you want to know about chemtrails, look up in the air!
[00:36:50.262 --> 00:36:51.142]  There's chemtrails above the air!
[00:36:51.162 --> 00:37:02.865]  Well, you're right, but I mean, the politicians love to say something that's a message to their people, and they write about this in their memoirs, and then, and it has a double meaning for the sheep, for the cattle, they just love that.
[00:37:04.246 --> 00:37:10.047]  If they get something out of it, it somehow increases the rush they get from whatever this dark power is.
[00:37:10.868 --> 00:37:16.009]  But, you know, you also talk about solutions, and with regard to the FEMA camps, I actually was
[00:37:16.539 --> 00:37:32.730]  When I did wake up, I was in the middle of making an album and I ended up changing all sorts of the songs and lyrics around once I had discovered, you know, once I'd gone down the rabbit hole and discovered this, you know, this sick and twisted vision that's being played out by the elite.
[00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:44.538]  And in the second track on the album, which is called Eugene Nixon, I actually say, we got led down to the nice new safe camp to learn all about Eugene Nixon.
[00:37:45.402 --> 00:37:48.943]  We got knocked out in the greatest time to be rolling around like a pig in its pen.
[00:37:49.823 --> 00:38:00.866]  And, um, you know, people are being led down, you know, this path thinking that it's all, you know, grand and great, and they have no idea that there's a big, you know, grinder at the end of, uh... Absolutely.
[00:38:01.326 --> 00:38:02.126]  I appreciate your call.
[00:38:02.146 --> 00:38:07.908]  Well, more than that, they know something's wrong, but Bush is bad, Obama will fix it, and now, well, Obama
[00:38:08.975 --> 00:38:13.619]  Obama's bad, but only because the evil right-wingers won't let him do what he needs to do.
[00:38:13.699 --> 00:38:14.339]  It's their fault.
[00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:15.840]  We need to arrest them.
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:26.328]  I mean, I get hundreds of emails, no exaggeration today, when I look at YouTube in the comments, every third or fourth comment is, you're a racist white pig, you need to be arrested.
[00:38:26.849 --> 00:38:28.570]  You click on their channel, it's a white person.
[00:38:29.451 --> 00:38:37.817]  Or I look at local newspapers about the ObamaInfoWars.com Joker poster contest, and they're saying, these racists need to be arrested, they're dangerous.
[00:38:38.697 --> 00:38:42.019]  Well, I think that's a very touchy subject.
[00:39:01.383 --> 00:39:07.046]  Really no appropriate way, necessarily, to handle this other than to just simply judge each president on their merits.
[00:39:07.427 --> 00:39:09.428]  And I think that that's what we've got to do.
[00:39:10.788 --> 00:39:15.011]  You know, we knew Obama's record before he went into office.
[00:39:15.071 --> 00:39:19.514]  I know that you were on your radio program telling people, you've got to watch out for this guy.
[00:39:19.534 --> 00:39:20.994]  You had the Obama deception out.
[00:39:21.034 --> 00:39:24.576]  You know, there was a lot of things going on, but still, all in all, the guy got elected.
[00:39:25.137 --> 00:39:25.757]  Big surprise.
[00:39:28.659 --> 00:39:28.879]  You know,
[00:39:29.932 --> 00:39:31.092]  Touchy subject.
[00:39:31.212 --> 00:39:34.913]  I just think we should judge people on their merits, what they've done.
[00:39:34.933 --> 00:39:35.874]  That's 31-33.
[00:39:36.074 --> 00:39:43.396]  But I mean, it's so American, it's so human to criticize the corrupt emperor, the king, the leader.
[00:39:43.976 --> 00:39:46.076]  And over and over again, I have several newscasts.
[00:39:46.116 --> 00:39:48.357]  In fact, guys, will you queue up the North Texas
[00:39:49.983 --> 00:39:51.824]  Did I give you that latest TV report?
[00:39:52.264 --> 00:39:55.186]  Where they're going, I think it's wrong to show our president in a bad light.
[00:39:55.566 --> 00:39:59.228]  Thank God we got him taken down before any young people saw them.
[00:39:59.248 --> 00:40:04.491]  You know, they're acting like our supporters were posting pornography or something.
[00:40:05.652 --> 00:40:11.015]  Again, to call him a socialist, to call him a fascist, it isn't racist, it's because he's black.
[00:40:12.396 --> 00:40:15.198]  Again, they're using that as a political tool is what I'm saying, William.
[00:40:16.018 --> 00:40:16.678]  Sure, I understand.
[00:40:18.884 --> 00:40:35.812]  You know, if they feel that way, I think they're really going to hate Camp FEMA because, you know, we've got an entire segment in there dedicated to showing how Obama's putting together this youth army, just like we saw put together in Nazi Germany, which of course was outlawed at one point because they knew what it was.
[00:40:36.392 --> 00:40:38.833]  And then Hitler managed to get it reinstated.
[00:40:39.033 --> 00:40:42.555]  Their Hitler youth essentially became known as.
[00:40:44.446 --> 00:40:54.249]  Well that's why in Africa they love 10, 11, 12, 13 year old citizen soldiers because they're wild fighters and think it's all a game and will do whatever they're told.
[00:40:56.029 --> 00:40:58.870]  Well this is the great thing about getting a hold of young minds.
[00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:01.231]  You can train those young minds
[00:41:02.034 --> 00:41:06.196]  With all sorts of propaganda and have them do anything that you want.
[00:41:06.256 --> 00:41:07.697]  I mean, and how innocent, too.
[00:41:07.777 --> 00:41:12.199]  I mean, this is, you know, this was kind of the whole idea of the Youth Army to begin with.
[00:41:13.179 --> 00:41:20.782]  Those will be the spies in your community that will turn people over to the authorities because they did something that they weren't supposed to.
[00:41:21.403 --> 00:41:26.145]  You know, as innocent as a paperboy showing up to deliver the paper, see something on your desk that might be
[00:41:26.997 --> 00:41:27.277]  Absolutely.
[00:41:27.317 --> 00:41:34.840]  We're going to play a select from your film Camp FEMA here in just a few minutes and continue with phone calls into the next hour with Gary Franchi and you'll stay with us.
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.380]  But since I mentioned it and I've got
[00:41:54.961 --> 00:41:56.502]  A whole bunch of video newscasts.
[00:41:56.522 --> 00:41:57.283]  These are coming in.
[00:41:57.343 --> 00:41:59.064]  So many of them, I can't even watch it.
[00:41:59.384 --> 00:42:11.011]  A huge information war coup in that from Berlin, Germany to Tokyo, Japan, from Moscow, Russia to major capital cities in Central and South America.
[00:42:11.031 --> 00:42:22.318]  I've now been on Ecuadorian TV, other channels, the Obama... Obama as... Yeah, we're playing a clip there in the background.
[00:42:22.338 --> 00:42:23.058]  Let's hold off for a second.
[00:42:25.131 --> 00:42:28.652]  Everywhere, this is being covered.
[00:42:29.852 --> 00:42:34.373]  And it's not just because it's InfoWars.com and Obama is the joker to catch people's attention.
[00:42:35.453 --> 00:42:46.555]  Now our new contest is $1,000 for whoever makes the best poster, period, as long as it has InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com on it, videotapes putting those posters up on YouTube.
[00:42:46.775 --> 00:42:50.495]  And I will judge it off the best video about the posters and the poster itself.
[00:42:50.796 --> 00:42:53.216]  That's what's fed into the decision of who wins.
[00:42:54.571 --> 00:42:58.676]  But it's all about showing people the power of just putting up posters.
[00:42:59.017 --> 00:43:03.703]  For a decade or more before 1776, that's what our forebearers did.
[00:43:04.443 --> 00:43:09.450]  Even if they shut the web down, shut TV off, shut our communications off, which the Pentagon's announcing
[00:43:10.896 --> 00:43:20.002]  They are setting up a takeover of the internet to shut down opposition to NORTHCOM and the 400,000 troops they've now announced they plan on putting on the streets.
[00:43:20.022 --> 00:43:22.264]  They're trying a hot coup takeover.
[00:43:22.824 --> 00:43:26.166]  They've listed veterans and gun owners and landowners as the terrorists.
[00:43:26.246 --> 00:43:28.067]  You are being listed as terrorists.
[00:43:28.147 --> 00:43:28.988]  This is real.
[00:43:29.228 --> 00:43:36.293]  What happened in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia and Maoist China and Pol Pot's Cambodia and Fidel Castro's Cuba is now happening.
[00:43:38.454 --> 00:43:44.616]  Obama's new FCC head of diversity officer says they want to put in Chavez controls here.
[00:43:44.636 --> 00:43:47.557]  I mean, they're not playing games.
[00:43:48.177 --> 00:43:51.939]  And so, make whatever poster you want, get out there and put it up.
[00:43:52.859 --> 00:43:53.219]  Okay?
[00:43:53.799 --> 00:43:56.080]  And then send us the video of you posting the poster.
[00:43:57.555 --> 00:44:02.099]  Any comments on our whole poster campaign and its success?
[00:44:02.219 --> 00:44:02.779]  I did it!
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:08.163]  Showing people their power if they'll just take action with a message, with an idea.
[00:44:10.685 --> 00:44:16.049]  Yeah, posters are definitely the way to go, especially if the internet ends up getting shut down.
[00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:21.894]  DVDs obviously are a great way to go because people don't have to read, they can just pop in and watch it.
[00:44:22.254 --> 00:44:24.996]  But a poster, if you're clever enough about designing your poster,
[00:44:25.866 --> 00:44:27.969]  No, they've tried to create a chilling effect.
[00:44:28.009 --> 00:44:30.311]  They've dropped the charges on the teen or never filed them.
[00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:43.131]  Because it blew up in their face.
[00:44:43.151 --> 00:44:45.012]  They tried to intimidate and it didn't work.
[00:44:45.032 --> 00:44:46.933]  People put up more, so they backed off in Florida.
[00:44:47.353 --> 00:44:49.254]  But no, do it legally and lawfully.
[00:44:49.294 --> 00:44:50.074]  Take Hayes County.
[00:44:50.474 --> 00:44:51.635]  In fact, that article's out on the desk.
[00:44:51.775 --> 00:44:53.476]  Somebody grab it for me about the hate crime I've committed.
[00:44:53.876 --> 00:45:00.640]  It said it's not illegal that Alex Jones's listeners are putting him up in Hayes County, but we need to pass a law to make it illegal.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:01.100]  Go ahead.
[00:45:03.581 --> 00:45:07.784]  Yeah, this is the, you know, the continuation of the
[00:45:09.614 --> 00:45:15.455]  Powers in control that want to shut down opposition to their authority, their control.
[00:45:16.236 --> 00:45:26.978]  And just like we point out in Camp FEMA, these forces that are, you know, controlling our government, it's not Obama and it's not George Bush.
[00:45:27.418 --> 00:45:35.500]  You know, there's other people behind the scenes here pulling the strings because we see too many similarities in their doctrines and the way they think and the words that they use.
[00:45:36.058 --> 00:45:45.716]  That's right, there's a total congruency, and the National Security Council is the true dictatorship over FEMA, over NORTHCOM, and all presidents are just frontmen.
[00:45:47.432 --> 00:45:50.874]  Exactly, so I don't know that it really makes any difference who's in power.
[00:45:50.954 --> 00:46:06.643]  The problem that we've got here is that anyone who opposes the administration on anything, I mean literally we're talking about something as simple as immigration or abortion, things that they've used in the past heavily to divide the Republicans and the Democrats.
[00:46:06.683 --> 00:46:07.724]  Now they're coming out and saying,
[00:46:08.184 --> 00:46:08.984]  I don't think so.
[00:46:27.774 --> 00:46:29.475]  And those are the rules, I think.
[00:46:29.495 --> 00:46:37.500]  Those are the ones we discussed that are going to be used to haul those people off to these FEMA camps and contain them, keep them away from the public.
[00:46:37.961 --> 00:46:40.262]  You know, the FEMA camp will be your free speech.
[00:46:40.282 --> 00:46:45.585]  Go there and say what you need to say and you can't leave.
[00:46:45.625 --> 00:46:46.306]  Anyway, you know, it's a...
[00:46:51.618 --> 00:46:53.438]  And William, this is not your opinion.
[00:46:53.498 --> 00:47:03.541]  When they say, if your Homeland Security National ID card, now they issue a Hemispheric North American ID card, that the TV ads are on television, people are still in denial.
[00:47:04.641 --> 00:47:08.522]  If you don't pay your bills, if you have bad credit, they're going to turn the card off.
[00:47:08.542 --> 00:47:09.223]  This has been announced.
[00:47:09.303 --> 00:47:14.104]  I saw Ridge in 2002 before Homeland Security even got funding.
[00:47:14.719 --> 00:47:19.201]  In a congressional roundtable, four big tables together in a square.
[00:47:20.381 --> 00:47:21.542]  And he was explaining it.
[00:47:21.802 --> 00:47:23.483]  You're gonna have to have this ID to have a job.
[00:47:23.503 --> 00:47:25.003]  You're gonna have to have this ID.
[00:47:25.023 --> 00:47:26.424]  There'll be no underground economy.
[00:47:26.504 --> 00:47:27.885]  No garage sales allowed.
[00:47:28.525 --> 00:47:30.126]  No more roadside sales.
[00:47:30.986 --> 00:47:32.286]  Everything's gonna be controlled.
[00:47:32.306 --> 00:47:36.688]  We're gonna have TSA in the streets, at the malls, on the buses, in the trains.
[00:47:37.088 --> 00:47:37.769]  Checkpoints.
[00:47:38.369 --> 00:47:41.810]  The feds are gonna take over the local cities through the threat fusion centers.
[00:47:42.351 --> 00:47:42.951]  Through FEMA.
[00:47:43.871 --> 00:48:09.458]  And he was saying how great this was, and how, and then now they say no fly list, a million two hundred thousand and growing on it, now you'll be a no gun by list, and they openly are announcing that we'll just say you can't own a gun, no judge, no jury, you're not arrested, and their own homeland security documents leaked to us that we put out from good people inside, a federal marshal gave it to us, I'll just
[00:48:10.327 --> 00:48:10.848]  Leave it at that.
[00:48:11.609 --> 00:48:15.496]  Says, gun owners and veterans are the number one threat to America.
[00:48:15.816 --> 00:48:18.741]  It's all for the American people!
[00:48:19.042 --> 00:48:20.564]  It was never about Al-Qaeda!
[00:48:20.845 --> 00:48:22.047]  Al-Qaeda's CIA!
[00:48:22.087 --> 00:48:22.468]  Go ahead.
[00:48:25.525 --> 00:48:28.406]  Yeah, you know, you probably can add a few other things to that list too.
[00:48:29.287 --> 00:48:42.892]  Gun control, Federal Reserve, if you're against the United Nations, or North American Union, if you even mention the word New World Order, if you have a problem with your income tax, or being radio frequently identified with an RFID chip and tracked.
[00:48:43.522 --> 00:48:47.005]  That's a problem for them if you are against abortion or illegal immigration.
[00:48:47.385 --> 00:48:48.706]  Those are their main topics.
[00:48:49.147 --> 00:48:59.135]  If you're protesting the Fed, and now they're saying, if you say no to the naked body scanner, don't put your wife and kids in it, to scan your naked body, they're going to put you on a no-fly list as a terrorist.
[00:48:59.175 --> 00:49:01.938]  I mean, this government is completely rogue and criminal.
[00:49:03.159 --> 00:49:03.639]  Absolutely.
[00:49:03.939 --> 00:49:11.546]  This all ties into, like you were mentioning before, people who own private property and who believe that they're private property rights.
[00:49:12.288 --> 00:49:21.115]  Outweigh any you know federal intervention or even states coming in and saying that if you don't pay your taxes We're going to take that property away from you those types of issues.
[00:49:21.775 --> 00:49:35.205]  I know that this is really big right now in Kansas City We you know we covered the the 10th amendment as part of the conclusion in this documentary as a solution and what we're talking about of course is states rights and
[00:49:35.812 --> 00:49:45.575]  Uh, the, the citizens, the citizenry going back and, uh, electing sheriffs in their communities that they know uphold and stand for the Constitution.
[00:49:45.955 --> 00:49:50.776]  And then again, getting involved yourself, running for these local offices where politics actually begins.
[00:49:50.856 --> 00:49:56.518]  Because if you can affect, you know, if you can influence your local politics, that's where it all begins.
[00:49:56.678 --> 00:50:00.019]  And that trickles up to your state, which is where it's supposed to stop.
[00:50:00.579 --> 00:50:04.740]  But unfortunately, you know, the feds have found a way to sneak in there and try to withhold
[00:50:05.615 --> 00:50:11.657]  You know, federal aid or funding for whatever reason if you don't sign on to their new legislation or whatever they have in store for you.
[00:50:12.077 --> 00:50:12.578]  That's it.
[00:50:13.178 --> 00:50:13.738]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:13.778 --> 00:50:19.920]  We've got to say no to the federal government that itself is run by offshore private banks, openly.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:23.901]  And we've just got to say, you're illegitimate, you're criminal, it's over.
[00:50:24.122 --> 00:50:26.162]  Your NORTHCOM isn't going to march against us.
[00:50:26.742 --> 00:50:31.744]  I mean, have you seen in the AP where they're announcing 400,000 troops to now occupy the US?
[00:50:31.824 --> 00:50:33.705]  I mean, this is real, folks.
[00:50:35.017 --> 00:50:35.717]  This is real.
[00:50:36.818 --> 00:50:39.239]  And no amount of thumb-sucking or denial is going to stop it.
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:45.203]  Only getting up, getting angry, getting focused, getting Camp FEMA, getting the Obama deception, getting the New World Order.
[00:50:45.863 --> 00:50:48.084]  The new film we're also selling at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:48.104 --> 00:50:50.446]  A lot of stuff getting announced, a lot of stuff happening right now.
[00:50:50.866 --> 00:50:52.667]  Get it, get it all out to everybody.
[00:50:52.707 --> 00:50:53.667]  William Lewis is our guest.

[00:52:02.779 --> 00:52:04.880]  A new world order.
[00:52:05.581 --> 00:52:10.384]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:52:10.484 --> 00:52:12.625]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:52:13.326 --> 00:52:15.567]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:52:16.087 --> 00:52:18.509]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:52:19.274 --> 00:52:26.595]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:52:29.625 --> 00:52:35.029]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[00:52:41.493 --> 00:52:42.654]  Most people have no idea.
[00:52:42.674 --> 00:52:43.434]  They're not after money.
[00:52:43.454 --> 00:52:44.535]  They have all the money they need.
[00:52:44.735 --> 00:52:45.476]  They're after power.
[00:52:45.696 --> 00:52:46.596]  That's their after news.

[00:54:53.659 --> 00:54:54.699]  This is a great film.
[00:54:54.739 --> 00:54:55.440]  This is the truth.
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:58.380]  This needs to be seen to stop this whole agenda.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.540]  We need to make this a big film.
[00:55:00.041 --> 00:55:02.081]  Let's go ahead and go to a clip here.
[00:55:03.019 --> 00:55:04.820]  Some of the selects from Camp FEMA.
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:05.240]  Here it is.
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:09.301]  Technology has created a new brand of terrorism.
[00:55:09.762 --> 00:55:15.304]  There were persons who, for whatever reason, came to view their home country as the enemy.
[00:55:15.824 --> 00:55:18.665]  The kind of right-wing religious-based domestic terrorism.
[00:55:18.825 --> 00:55:21.026]  Disturbing news tonight about homegrown terror.
[00:55:21.346 --> 00:55:27.468]  Part of this is a big change in the White House, a new cultural experience, and some of the crazies are coming out of their closet.
[00:55:27.808 --> 00:55:32.673]  Right now it looks like there is no connection between the man arrested and any known terrorist cell.
[00:55:32.833 --> 00:55:33.394]  Homegrown.
[00:55:33.414 --> 00:55:34.475]  Yeah, homegrown, I should say.
[00:55:34.815 --> 00:55:37.097]  Folks, we've got a very serious situation here.
[00:55:37.217 --> 00:55:45.005]  I'm holding what is called the right-wing extremism, current economic and political climate, fueling resurgence and radicalization and recruitment.
[00:55:45.725 --> 00:55:50.169]  And in it we talked about the fact that they define pro-lifers as domestic terrorists.
[00:55:50.189 --> 00:56:12.367]  They put this in a Department of Homeland Security document, this official assessment, now saying pro-lifers, people that believe in end-time prophecies, people that are opposed to the administration's position on immigration, those of us that are standing up for the sanctity of life and for the sanctity of merit, all of those are now potential, and this is what they're saying, domestic terrorists.
[00:56:12.487 --> 00:56:13.989]  It's a terrorist next door
[00:56:14.649 --> 00:56:16.330]  That could be our bigger threat.
[00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:31.975]  They call people who believe in the sanctity of life, who believe in owning firearms, who believe in serving their country, the military, and coming back, who are very concerned about the policies that this nation is embarking on, spending too much money, taxing too much.
[00:56:32.235 --> 00:56:33.796]  It's all enlisted right here.
[00:56:34.514 --> 00:56:37.375]  These are the domestic right-wing extremists.
[00:56:37.755 --> 00:56:40.496]  One million names under the watchful eye of the United States.
[00:56:40.936 --> 00:56:47.018]  America's so-called terrorist watch list has hit the record number according to one of the country's most prominent civil liberties groups.
[00:56:47.318 --> 00:56:49.099]  That's a lot of people to keep track of.
[00:56:49.119 --> 00:56:50.899]  They're adding new people all the time.
[00:56:51.119 --> 00:56:55.641]  It's a secret list that you don't know really quite how one gets on and you don't know how you get off.
[00:56:59.753 --> 00:57:04.257]  They're coming out and profiling huge groups of people.
[00:57:04.277 --> 00:57:09.462]  If you voted for a certain political candidate, you should be considered a potential threat.
[00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:24.217]  And you couple that with things like the Patriot Act, where if you are a threat in their eyes, you can be held without access to judge, jury, and without access to a lawyer, or even to your family.
[00:57:25.077 --> 00:57:31.740]  That's very concerning, because we've watched our country go through and do this to brown people, you know, overseas.
[00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:37.043]  They're rounding up enemy combatants, and they're putting them in camps, and they are torturing them.
[00:57:37.083 --> 00:57:38.003]  That is a fact.
[00:57:38.084 --> 00:57:38.764]  We know that.
[00:57:41.099 --> 00:57:50.542]  In Missouri, a new document meant to help Missouri law enforcement agencies identify militia members or domestic terrorists has drawn criticism.
[00:57:51.202 --> 00:58:07.647]  The February 20 report, called the Modern Militia Movement, mentions such red flags as political bumper stickers for third-party candidates, such as Ron Paul, who ran for president, talk of conspiracy theories, such as the plan for a superhighway linking Canada to Mexico,
[00:58:08.404 --> 00:58:08.844]  Alright, head boss.
[00:58:38.815 --> 00:58:44.199]  And now they say if you disagree with... Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:47.882]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.623 --> 00:58:54.627]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.867 --> 00:58:56.649]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.869 --> 00:59:05.157]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:05.398 --> 00:59:10.623]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.943 --> 00:59:12.565]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.805 --> 00:59:19.126]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:19.306 --> 00:59:30.069]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:30.869]  That's right.
[00:59:31.129 --> 00:59:33.449]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:59:33.689 --> 00:59:35.270]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:59:37.210 --> 00:59:38.911]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.124 --> 01:00:15.408]  We've got these sneak peeks and trailers, all the rest of it up on InfoWars.com.
[01:00:15.428 --> 01:00:21.092]  If you're in for pre-ordering, Camp Fever ships out on or before September 18th.
[01:00:21.272 --> 01:00:27.857]  This film, New World Order on DVD, expanded with a bunch of great extras that I'm of course in and also consulted on.
[01:00:28.198 --> 01:00:32.201]  We're selling it available at InfoWars.com, discounted out of the gates.
[01:00:33.679 --> 01:00:34.620]  Hi, how are you Alex?
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:35.580]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:36.021]  Welcome.
[01:00:36.041 --> 01:00:36.221]  Thank you.
[01:00:36.241 --> 01:00:38.222]  I just want to let you know that my wife
[01:01:03.547 --> 01:01:19.158]  I was listening to your show for the last year and a half, two years, and I am now just becoming a believer in the last few months, but she has heard your comment about the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[01:01:20.419 --> 01:01:20.759]  Okay?
[01:01:21.119 --> 01:01:22.560]  And we both believe that, of course.
[01:01:23.581 --> 01:01:33.068]  Now, what she has done is filed an actual document with the government to claim the power of the sun, the energy of the sun.
[01:01:34.218 --> 01:01:40.060]  And we have the business number, and now we have the documents for the patent.
[01:01:54.338 --> 01:01:57.960]  The science czar says they're doing this and want to expand it.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.881]  That's hurting your crops.
[01:01:59.921 --> 01:02:00.901]  That's hurting your life.
[01:02:01.261 --> 01:02:04.783]  That's why they keep the details secret, so people have trouble suing them.
[01:02:04.803 --> 01:02:06.924]  But I think that's a way to stop them.
[01:02:06.944 --> 01:02:08.125]  Let's bring William Lewis up.
[01:02:08.465 --> 01:02:12.067]  William, that's an intriguing idea that Wayne has in Canada.
[01:02:13.728 --> 01:02:19.670]  Yeah, I guess the question is whether they would actually let you take out a patent on something like that.
[01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:20.611]  What is the patent for?
[01:02:22.728 --> 01:02:23.709]  Could you explain that a little more?
[01:02:23.789 --> 01:02:25.089]  Yeah, what is the patent for, sir?
[01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:27.151]  Okay, the patent is not for the sun.
[01:02:27.171 --> 01:02:29.192]  It's for the energy from the sun.
[01:02:30.853 --> 01:02:31.713]  Gotcha.
[01:02:32.334 --> 01:02:34.295]  As in to power a solar panel.
[01:02:36.116 --> 01:02:38.718]  Yeah, I think they only let you patent the device itself.
[01:02:39.178 --> 01:02:47.183]  You can't patent a naturally occurring thing, though that's what the GMO companies do when they alter something, then they claim ownership of it.
[01:02:48.202 --> 01:02:49.403]  But it's an intriguing idea.
[01:02:49.443 --> 01:02:52.684]  You want to write it up as an idea, Wayne, just to get people thinking.
[01:02:52.724 --> 01:02:53.905]  I think it's a good exercise.
[01:02:54.285 --> 01:02:56.626]  Send it to us at writersandinfowars.com.
[01:02:56.646 --> 01:02:57.186]  Thank you, Wayne.
[01:02:57.606 --> 01:03:01.268]  Vincent in Virginia, and Sam and others.
[01:03:01.308 --> 01:03:01.948]  Go ahead, Vincent.
[01:03:02.588 --> 01:03:04.569]  Hi, Alex and Mr. Lewis.
[01:03:04.669 --> 01:03:16.574]  Thanks for having me on down here in Virginia near Old Dominion University campus where the women are pretty and the Gardasil commercials flourish.
[01:03:19.208 --> 01:03:27.876]  I just had a couple of questions slash comments for you, Alex, and I had one for William Lewis.
[01:03:29.398 --> 01:03:35.143]  I was just wondering, I managed to get on Jason Bermas' show a couple of weeks ago.
[01:03:35.163 --> 01:03:40.028]  This is the first time I've been on yours, so it's a real big thing for me right now.
[01:03:40.048 --> 01:03:41.790]  Well, it's big medicine having you.
[01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:43.071]  Go ahead and make your points.
[01:03:44.472 --> 01:03:53.836]  Well, I was just wanting to know if you had ever, he said he had never seen the movie The Hidden Agenda by G. Edward Griffin.
[01:03:55.397 --> 01:03:56.677]  And it's an interview.
[01:03:56.697 --> 01:03:57.438]  Yeah, I've seen it.
[01:03:58.098 --> 01:03:58.558]  I've seen it.
[01:03:58.618 --> 01:04:00.139]  I heard it on AXS TV probably.
[01:04:00.359 --> 01:04:01.459]  Yeah.
[01:04:01.699 --> 01:04:04.080]  I'd seen a smattering of your movies.
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.241]  I bought a couple of them.
[01:04:05.661 --> 01:04:10.923]  And, you know, it's kind of hard to believe all that stuff without having a background like that.
[01:04:11.063 --> 01:04:13.264]  So for anybody who's a skeptic,
[01:04:14.344 --> 01:04:17.026]  Um, that's definitely one I would recommend Googling.
[01:04:17.807 --> 01:04:21.950]  Well, G. Edward Griffin, uh, is in my new Fall of the Republic film.
[01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:26.493]  I mean, Alan Watt, just, the list goes on and on.
[01:04:26.513 --> 01:04:27.694]  This film's gonna blow people away.
[01:04:28.674 --> 01:04:28.915]  Yeah.
[01:04:29.255 --> 01:04:31.356]  Yeah, I wish I made more money.
[01:04:31.416 --> 01:04:33.998]  I could get more of these movies that you guys put out.
[01:04:34.018 --> 01:04:34.319]  I love them.
[01:04:34.339 --> 01:04:37.661]  Well, just, I mean, you can, you can, you can pass the free YouTube clips around.
[01:04:37.681 --> 01:04:41.123]  Endgame, Obama Deceptions, all free in its entirety on YouTube.
[01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:41.984]  Okay.
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:47.402]  Yeah, I just had another question for Mr. Lewis.
[01:04:47.643 --> 01:04:49.764]  Alright, real fast, when we get back, you can ask that question.
[01:04:50.244 --> 01:04:51.865]  Good to hear from you there, Vincent.
[01:04:51.905 --> 01:04:57.209]  We'll come back then to Sam in the Netherlands, Virgil in Ohio, then Gary Franci, the producer of the film.
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:00.401]  Stay with us.

[01:06:31.153 --> 01:06:31.433]  We're good.

[01:08:12.413 --> 01:08:13.214]  You want answers?
[01:08:14.015 --> 01:08:15.498]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:15.538 --> 01:08:19.163]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:19.744 --> 01:08:23.810]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.032 --> 01:08:29.794]  We got about 52 minutes left of this final hour of transmission today.
[01:08:29.854 --> 01:08:31.175]  Gary Franci is on with us.
[01:08:31.195 --> 01:08:33.636]  The filmmaker William Lewis is on with us.
[01:08:33.696 --> 01:08:35.377]  I want to open the phones up.
[01:08:35.538 --> 01:08:37.839]  I had a bunch of callers on from before William got on.
[01:08:38.119 --> 01:08:39.700]  Those callers are all now been gone too.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:46.404]  I'm going to ask the people holding here, Sam and Virgil and Tony and Abel and others,
[01:08:47.288 --> 01:08:52.993]  Address questions about the FEMA camps, the martial law, the New World Order, the film camp FEMA to our two guests, please.
[01:08:53.534 --> 01:09:01.821]  Then you can bring up some other side issue if you want, but 1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to get on board with us.
[01:09:02.501 --> 01:09:03.882]  I did want to make two quick announcements.
[01:09:05.384 --> 01:09:12.049]  We've got a bunch of Don't Tread on Me cold pepper t-shirts that aren't just the snake on a yellow shirt.
[01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:13.731]  Other variants of it are coming in.
[01:09:15.482 --> 01:09:17.925]  And those new shirts coming in are going to be limited run.
[01:09:19.066 --> 01:09:24.271]  There's going to be, say, 1,500 of all sizes, and when they're gone, they're gone.
[01:09:25.152 --> 01:09:26.974]  Same thing with these Obama posters.
[01:09:28.635 --> 01:09:39.166]  We took the classic Obama joker, put fascism, put New World Order, put InfoWars.com under it, and also improved on the image by more saturating it, making it look a little bit cleaner.
[01:09:39.815 --> 01:09:53.039]  We've got better images of him as the Joker and Bush as the Joker, so those are going to be the only ones that are available in the next few weeks when we sell out of the classic Obama Joker.
[01:09:53.099 --> 01:09:54.279]  So it's limited edition.
[01:09:54.779 --> 01:10:04.222]  If you want to get your hands on it, InfoWars.com, in the Fed, that's what it says on the back, in the Fed on one shirt, another shirt says arrest the criminal, stop the criminal.
[01:10:05.851 --> 01:10:07.893]  There's some that just say InfoWars.com.
[01:10:08.393 --> 01:10:14.899]  If you want one of these classic shirts, we're making them special by saying that when they're gone, they're gone and that's it.
[01:10:17.541 --> 01:10:26.148]  So I hope everybody gets them because the media nationally has said it's racist, it's evil, it's bad, and you should be arrested if you put these up on light poles.
[01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:32.453]  Though, the State Attorney General said they're not going to charge the youth who put them up in one area of Florida.
[01:10:32.473 --> 01:10:34.635]  Because when they said they were about to arrest him,
[01:10:35.583 --> 01:10:37.204]  People put up hundreds of times.
[01:10:37.244 --> 01:10:38.565]  I mean, it's all over Florida.
[01:10:38.826 --> 01:10:45.851]  The Toronto Star told me Saturday when they called me, they said every road in the city has them.
[01:10:46.472 --> 01:10:48.814]  They said, are you behind this?
[01:10:48.834 --> 01:10:50.595]  And I said, no, it's my idea.
[01:10:51.216 --> 01:10:52.056]  But I said, no.
[01:10:52.657 --> 01:10:54.458]  She said, I mean, did you hire hundreds of people?
[01:10:54.518 --> 01:10:54.979]  I said, no.
[01:10:55.635 --> 01:11:00.258]  People are mad that the media tried to censor them and said they couldn't put this image up.
[01:11:00.618 --> 01:11:01.499]  And this is only the beginning.
[01:11:01.739 --> 01:11:03.701]  So the Joker thing is out of control.
[01:11:04.061 --> 01:11:04.681]  It's awesome.
[01:11:05.082 --> 01:11:07.203]  It lets the system know they're not going to silence us.
[01:11:07.723 --> 01:11:14.328]  With the announcements of how the Pentagon's taking the web over to quote, shut it down, and to quote, shut alternative blogs down.
[01:11:14.588 --> 01:11:16.409]  I mean, it's really happening.
[01:11:16.449 --> 01:11:18.731]  The Pentagon themselves say this.
[01:11:18.751 --> 01:11:21.853]  You know, they're freaking out in CNET News and the AP.
[01:11:21.893 --> 01:11:22.974]  It's much worse than this.
[01:11:24.588 --> 01:11:26.770]  The establishment is losing the hearts and minds.
[01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:27.871]  They're going to shut the web down.
[01:11:27.911 --> 01:11:32.055]  They're going to launch fake cyber attacks against the web and shut it down in the name of its safety.
[01:11:32.296 --> 01:11:33.617]  I've been telling you that for eight months.
[01:11:33.977 --> 01:11:35.018]  They're now saying it!
[01:11:35.499 --> 01:11:37.260]  They're now getting you ready to accept it.
[01:11:38.582 --> 01:11:38.742]  So...
[01:11:40.658 --> 01:11:45.739]  Go get the ObamaInfoWars.com posters that are up on InfoWars.com in the contest area.
[01:11:46.039 --> 01:11:46.479]  Post them!
[01:11:46.919 --> 01:11:47.679]  I've gone out and do it.
[01:11:48.019 --> 01:11:55.161]  Don't let them chill your free speech, but more importantly, and I'm done plugging this, we have a contest running through Friday.
[01:11:55.821 --> 01:12:08.503]  And I may extend it a little bit, because I'm still getting videos of people putting up the Obama Joker, and I've gotten hundreds and hundreds, and I mean, it's over 300, Curt Nemo said, and that was a few days ago, of different ideas for poster art.
[01:12:09.335 --> 01:12:11.697]  We're having a contest for the best political poster.
[01:12:12.077 --> 01:12:15.540]  Anti-war, anti-vaccine, anti-fluoride, anti-chemtrail.
[01:12:17.102 --> 01:12:24.988]  It'll be whoever makes the best poster and on any subject will judge it on what gets the message across the best, not even what issue it is.
[01:12:25.849 --> 01:12:26.389]  I'm the judge.
[01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.711]  That's half of it.
[01:12:27.731 --> 01:12:37.399]  The other half is posting it in public and videotaping it and uploading it to YouTube or another major video site and sending it to contest at infowars.com.
[01:12:38.584 --> 01:12:42.086]  That is the contest, not the hundreds and hundreds of posters you're sending us.
[01:12:43.147 --> 01:12:45.429]  It needs to be posted in public.
[01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:47.530]  And videoed.
[01:12:48.611 --> 01:12:51.213]  So the message is, we're not just putting it up about Obama.
[01:12:52.914 --> 01:12:55.656]  A lot of people have made them with Obama and Bush next to each other.
[01:12:55.896 --> 01:12:58.357]  Saying that, you know, they work for the New World Order.
[01:12:58.617 --> 01:12:59.838]  Two sides of the same coin.
[01:12:59.958 --> 01:13:00.759]  Very effective.
[01:13:02.373 --> 01:13:09.380]  Whatever, it's about showing the establishment that the people can take over the information war if we want to.
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:11.241]  That is now what's happening.
[01:13:11.562 --> 01:13:14.805]  So that said, this is why we need to put up more posters now than ever.
[01:13:15.686 --> 01:13:19.649]  Just don't do it on government property, meaning property the slaves can't touch.
[01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:22.272]  Meaning you pay the money and the government tells you how to live.
[01:13:23.564 --> 01:13:24.464]  All over Texas.
[01:13:24.905 --> 01:13:27.005]  They've called for my arrest.
[01:13:27.065 --> 01:13:28.586]  They've called it hate speech.
[01:13:29.266 --> 01:13:30.507]  Hays County, it's not illegal.
[01:13:30.547 --> 01:13:32.707]  They say it should be made illegal so I can be arrested.
[01:13:33.868 --> 01:13:36.569]  It's Spanish TV internationals calling for my arrest.
[01:13:37.949 --> 01:13:39.110]  The TV here in the U.S.
[01:13:40.370 --> 01:13:41.110]  You've all seen it.
[01:13:43.031 --> 01:13:45.332]  We boldly just said, bring it on, First Amendment.
[01:13:46.027 --> 01:13:48.389]  They were going to arrest this youth in Florida, the one guy.
[01:13:48.409 --> 01:13:53.252]  An Obama supporter came up and started taking photos saying, I'm reporting you, like a body snatcher.
[01:13:53.292 --> 01:13:54.913]  You know, I'm a Nazi, I'm reporting you.
[01:13:55.374 --> 01:13:56.334]  You know, I'm going to get you.
[01:13:56.374 --> 01:13:58.055]  First Amendment's bad, putting on a light pole.
[01:13:58.596 --> 01:14:01.258]  Obama supporters rip them down everywhere, put up ten times more.
[01:14:01.858 --> 01:14:05.921]  Here is a local newscast out of northeast Texas, pretty big town.
[01:14:07.170 --> 01:14:15.937]  Well, they're acting like a murder's been committed, or a bank robbery's happened, and they're hyperventilating and freaking out, and, oh my God, the youth, it's so scary.
[01:14:16.178 --> 01:14:26.086]  Yeah, the public schools are pushing Ritalin, Prozac, SWAT teams, drug dogs, teaching people how to be petty and mindless, government brainwashing, dumbing them down.
[01:14:26.906 --> 01:14:30.169]  We teach them to respect the local authorities and the president.
[01:14:30.589 --> 01:14:33.572]  Thank God we ripped them down before the youth saw them.
[01:14:35.186 --> 01:14:35.986]  Oh, yeah, I think.
[01:14:36.487 --> 01:14:38.608]  And then they say it was antiwar.com.
[01:14:38.628 --> 01:14:39.928]  You can see the video at the school.
[01:14:39.988 --> 01:14:41.429]  It says InfoWars.com.
[01:14:41.769 --> 01:14:45.851]  So I guess they thought they would get me by not showing InfoWars.com.
[01:14:46.212 --> 01:14:48.092]  It isn't about InfoWars.com.
[01:14:48.513 --> 01:14:52.114]  It's about getting everybody to be active and to see the power you have.
[01:14:52.355 --> 01:14:55.476]  That's what Gandhi did for 20 plus years in India.
[01:14:55.756 --> 01:15:01.259]  That's what I'm doing is showing you the power you've got to stand up to these parasite
[01:15:01.699 --> 01:15:02.159]  Trash!
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:05.342]  We're going to Franchi and everybody in a minute, but I wanted to get to this.
[01:15:06.422 --> 01:15:10.505]  Here's the local newscast out of KLTV as we analyze it.
[01:15:10.545 --> 01:15:10.965]  Here it is.
[01:15:13.027 --> 01:15:18.130]  ...depicting President Obama as the Joker started appearing in Tyler, Texas yesterday.
[01:15:18.631 --> 01:15:23.974]  The altered picture of the president was made by a college student and has since gone worldwide via YouTube.
[01:15:24.575 --> 01:15:27.977]  Up to 20 posters were put on trees, signs, and windows.
[01:15:28.437 --> 01:15:29.518]  The only message was the
[01:15:30.202 --> 01:15:31.003]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[01:15:31.063 --> 01:15:32.664]  The guys had no way to communicate it to me.
[01:15:32.684 --> 01:15:34.606]  And that's the old one from two weeks ago.
[01:15:34.626 --> 01:15:37.189]  The new one, if you see it, says video no longer available.
[01:15:54.016 --> 01:16:01.122]  And I think that got linked by Drudge, it probably crashed KLTV's site, but that one talked about how evil and bad it was at the school.
[01:16:01.962 --> 01:16:03.203]  So let's go to Gary Franchi.
[01:16:03.644 --> 01:16:17.635]  Gary, and again the producer of Camp FEMA, now available at Infowars.com, and William Lewis, I had you guys hold the last six, seven minutes through that, because do you concur with what I'm saying, or do you have anything to add, or do you disagree?
[01:16:18.334 --> 01:16:20.376]  No, I'm actually... Oh, Alex, thanks for having me on.
[01:16:20.396 --> 01:16:23.538]  You know, I'm ready to go out and hit the streets myself.
[01:16:23.658 --> 01:16:25.759]  I drove down the street in my town.
[01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:28.141]  I saw this beautiful line of trees.
[01:16:28.201 --> 01:16:28.722]  I'm like, you know what?
[01:16:28.902 --> 01:16:32.164]  Every single tree needs a no-vaccine sign.
[01:16:32.825 --> 01:16:35.807]  And, you know, I'm ready to go down to Kinko's, print up a whole bunch and do it myself.
[01:16:35.867 --> 01:16:37.528]  So, I think it needs to be done.
[01:16:39.162 --> 01:16:39.682]  Absolutely.
[01:16:39.702 --> 01:16:47.307]  In fact, I saw a newscast freaking out in Temple about somebody putting up 10penny.com, the doctor, and saying, you know, vaccines are killing you.
[01:16:47.368 --> 01:16:49.689]  And doctors going, don't say that, it's lies.
[01:16:49.929 --> 01:16:51.630]  The Gardasil's killed a bunch of people.
[01:16:52.091 --> 01:16:54.032]  They admit the flu shot test in Europe.
[01:16:54.597 --> 01:16:55.097]  I got it wrong.
[01:16:55.137 --> 01:16:56.998]  Not the U.S., but in Europe killed some people.
[01:16:57.018 --> 01:17:01.461]  I mean, Google, flu vaccine kills in Europe.
[01:17:01.521 --> 01:17:03.082]  I mean, it was London Telegraph.
[01:17:03.582 --> 01:17:07.304]  So, yeah, they're telling us we can't go out and put something up.
[01:17:07.585 --> 01:17:09.766]  We've got to just sit here and accept their propaganda.
[01:17:11.391 --> 01:17:12.171]  It's ridiculous.
[01:17:12.211 --> 01:17:15.532]  It's time for the American people to rise up.
[01:17:15.812 --> 01:17:18.353]  I'm listening to you on this end and I'm getting fired up.
[01:17:18.393 --> 01:17:19.714]  I'm jumping out of my seat.
[01:17:20.354 --> 01:17:22.734]  And I hope that everyone else listening is feeling the same way.
[01:17:22.774 --> 01:17:23.735]  It's time to stand up.
[01:17:24.095 --> 01:17:25.115]  It's time to rise up.
[01:17:25.435 --> 01:17:26.896]  You will not find me in a FEMA camp.
[01:17:27.156 --> 01:17:28.296]  You will not find me there.
[01:17:29.577 --> 01:17:31.599]  Well, that's the thing about the film you and William have made.
[01:17:31.639 --> 01:17:33.640]  It's just amazing because it covers everything.
[01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:40.965]  It proves the history of it, how they operate, the police state, the demonization of dissidents that go with it, the COINTELPRO feds.
[01:17:41.306 --> 01:17:43.247]  I mean, you guys have knocked it out of the park, Gary.
[01:17:44.128 --> 01:17:53.635]  Alex, I am a God-blessed American citizen, and I will be... I am so fed up with these elitists
[01:18:03.765 --> 01:18:19.173]  It's an attempt to chill free speech as you know and it's an attempt to shut you down and to make everybody scared to have political speech just like when they say criticizing Obama is the n-word.
[01:18:19.193 --> 01:18:22.495]  I mean they are brutally trying to silence free speech.
[01:18:22.775 --> 01:18:23.836]  William Lewis comments.
[01:18:25.793 --> 01:18:27.116]  Well, yeah, here we go again.
[01:18:27.697 --> 01:18:32.349]  I think that the poster idea is a great idea, what Gary was saying, too, about the no vaccinations.
[01:18:33.809 --> 01:18:37.291]  You know, those are some of the issues that are dealt with in the documentary.
[01:18:37.311 --> 01:18:48.737]  We try not to get really specific and say that, you know, this is exactly what they're going to do with swine flu, because we've seen this happen before with anthrax and smallpox and, you know, back in 2000 and 2003 when they wanted to vaccinate us then.
[01:18:49.158 --> 01:18:56.862]  But this is a very real scenario, and if we go ahead and start educating people through these posters that we can put up in people's neighborhoods or, you know, wherever you want to,
[01:18:58.123 --> 01:19:00.505]  That, I think, is a great way to go.
[01:19:00.705 --> 01:19:04.528]  Maybe put a website at the bottom so they can get some information on it.
[01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:06.830]  Absolutely.
[01:19:07.451 --> 01:19:13.516]  I want to continue getting into Camp FEMA, but I do want to go to Vincent in Virginia, Sam in the Netherlands, and others that are holding.
[01:19:14.757 --> 01:19:20.702]  Gary, I think Camp FEMA is going to really be effective, and that's why I'm asking my listeners to get it, to pre-order it today.
[01:19:20.722 --> 01:19:21.703]  It comes out in two weeks.
[01:19:22.501 --> 01:19:25.122]  And to show it to everybody, have viewing parties.
[01:19:25.422 --> 01:19:33.944]  Are you wanting this to be like some of the other films, like Freedom to Fascism, that you're the steward of, that are meant to be virally distributed?
[01:19:34.804 --> 01:19:36.064]  Well, we want them to get out there.
[01:19:36.084 --> 01:19:37.125]  We want the people to see them.
[01:19:37.145 --> 01:19:38.245]  We want the viewing parties.
[01:19:38.985 --> 01:19:43.966]  You know, the film is copyrighted, but we can't produce more films unless people get them.
[01:19:44.646 --> 01:19:46.987]  But we're going to provide a bulk system in the future.
[01:19:48.431 --> 01:19:52.553]  Absolutely, and we'll be part of that at Infowars.com, but they should have viewing parties and show them to everybody.
[01:19:53.313 --> 01:19:53.934]  Absolutely.
[01:19:54.354 --> 01:19:54.934]  Absolutely.
[01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:56.335]  We're gonna have to get out, Alex.
[01:19:56.775 --> 01:19:57.495]  Alright, stay there.
[01:19:57.575 --> 01:19:59.136]  We'll be right back with Gary Franchi.
[01:19:59.995 --> 01:20:07.458]  And of course, e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[01:20:07.638 --> 01:20:09.178]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[01:20:09.319 --> 01:20:13.720]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:21.403]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[01:20:21.563 --> 01:20:24.024]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire.
[01:20:24.184 --> 01:20:32.389]  And has no dangerous second-hand smoke, so it's safe for the people around you, and will save you right around 50% over smoking regular cigarettes.
[01:20:32.669 --> 01:20:36.172]  So, get rid of the ashtrays, the smell, and the smoke.

[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:53.623]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:20:53.643 --> 01:20:59.087]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:21:14.858 --> 01:21:21.023]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:23.265]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:23.425 --> 01:21:25.827]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:21:25.907 --> 01:21:36.836]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:21:37.496 --> 01:21:38.777]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:39.178 --> 01:21:40.539]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:21:41.016 --> 01:21:47.339]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:21:56.184 --> 01:21:57.325]  The Obama Deception.
[01:21:57.765 --> 01:21:58.946]  The people strike back.
[01:22:00.663 --> 01:22:01.003]  Good day.
[01:22:01.224 --> 01:22:02.806]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:22:03.046 --> 01:22:03.446]  September 17, 2009.
[01:22:03.566 --> 01:22:04.688]  Gold opened this morning at $1,017.10.
[01:22:04.728 --> 01:22:08.172]  A one ounce gold coin to be purchased for $1,045.60, $522.80 for a half ounce, or $261.40 for a quarter ounce.
[01:22:08.212 --> 01:22:08.672]  That's $1,045.60, $522.80, or $261.40.
[01:22:20.726 --> 01:22:34.258]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[01:22:34.358 --> 01:22:42.946]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:43.166 --> 01:22:44.147]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:44.287 --> 01:22:48.432]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:22:48.632 --> 01:22:49.674]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:49.734 --> 01:22:51.315]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[01:22:51.396 --> 01:22:51.756]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:51.836 --> 01:22:52.136]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.726 --> 01:23:03.728]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graff Hunter safes.
[01:23:03.908 --> 01:23:07.551]  The makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[01:23:07.671 --> 01:23:10.253]  Graff Hunter safes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[01:23:10.533 --> 01:23:14.976]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.
[01:23:15.176 --> 01:23:19.560]  Whether it's a custom-fitted vault door safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:21.541]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[01:23:21.661 --> 01:23:22.181]  We're good to go.
[01:23:41.135 --> 01:23:41.435]  We're good.
[01:24:09.199 --> 01:24:22.683]  In fact, I printed this off this weekend and forgot to bring it.
[01:24:22.703 --> 01:24:24.904]  Will you guys print me off Wikipedia?
[01:24:25.484 --> 01:24:29.125]  And I actually had read this in a book about Benjamin Franklin.
[01:24:30.444 --> 01:24:31.404]  So I know it's accurate.
[01:24:31.765 --> 01:24:42.969]  I don't just believe what I see on Wikipedia about why we have the Gadsden flag or the symbol of the rattlesnake being one of the first symbols of this country even before the bald eagle.
[01:24:44.630 --> 01:24:47.891]  And I think the founders explained it quite well.
[01:24:49.892 --> 01:24:53.395]  Because we're not looking for trouble, but we're not going to your FEMA camps, we're not your slaves.
[01:24:53.755 --> 01:25:03.563]  Let's take calls for Gary Franchi, the producer, co-producer, with William Lewis, the director of Camp FEMA, now available, first day, at Infowars.com, out of the gates.
[01:25:04.183 --> 01:25:06.645]  We have it comboed up with the Obama Deception and other films.
[01:25:07.466 --> 01:25:10.208]  Let's talk to Vincent in Virginia, then Sam in the Netherlands.
[01:25:10.508 --> 01:25:11.729]  Vincent, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:12.770]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:25:13.571 --> 01:25:19.055]  Yeah, I just had one more question for Gary or William or whoever wanted to comment.
[01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:32.047]  I have an aunt whose father was a German immigrant during World War II and when he came over he was apparently detained by the FBI for two or three days for questioning.
[01:25:32.885 --> 01:25:36.968]  Uh, just to make sure he wasn't a Nazi operative or something of that sort.
[01:25:37.109 --> 01:25:37.769]  Oh, that's nothing!
[01:25:37.789 --> 01:25:45.796]  They put tens of thousands of German citizens in camps, Japanese, and then they stole the Japanese property in San Francisco and surrounding areas.
[01:25:45.836 --> 01:25:48.898]  They were very wealthy, been here in some cases over 150 years.
[01:25:49.379 --> 01:25:51.821]  Because, you know, Japan's in the Pacific.
[01:25:51.841 --> 01:25:57.205]  I mean, you talk to these guys like talking to an American, and they raped their women and everything else.
[01:25:57.465 --> 01:25:59.247]  They put Italian-Americans in camps.
[01:25:59.307 --> 01:25:59.647]  Go ahead.
[01:26:00.916 --> 01:26:08.041]  Yeah, I was just going to ask, how do you, I mean, what do you find if you're looking at these camps?
[01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:20.069]  I can't imagine it's easy to get inside of them to tell that it's made for, supposedly for, say, illegal immigrants or possible terrorists versus American citizens.
[01:26:20.329 --> 01:26:21.230]  I mean, how do you tell?
[01:26:21.250 --> 01:26:22.991]  Here's the thing.
[01:26:23.831 --> 01:26:26.293]  The Japanese internment camps were not even built.
[01:26:27.153 --> 01:26:28.894]  When they were rounded up.
[01:26:29.475 --> 01:26:38.562]  When I spoke to internment camp survivor Sam Ozaki, a Japanese-American, born in the United States, just like us, a citizen.
[01:26:39.643 --> 01:26:42.485]  He was rounded up, bussed off to these camps.
[01:26:42.986 --> 01:26:44.427]  But the camps, like I said, they weren't built.
[01:26:44.887 --> 01:26:50.131]  They used stadiums, they used amusement parks, fairgrounds.
[01:26:51.556 --> 01:26:52.476]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:27:12.083 --> 01:27:12.563]  Exactly.
[01:27:12.743 --> 01:27:19.745]  And, you know, the gentleman's asking, what makes a... what are the specific characteristics of a FEMA camp?
[01:27:20.125 --> 01:27:24.406]  Well, you know, hey, next time you're driving past your high school, look at the fences.
[01:27:25.126 --> 01:27:29.567]  Imagine everyone rounded up inside the fences in your high school stadium.
[01:27:29.987 --> 01:27:30.287]  Okay?
[01:27:30.807 --> 01:27:31.668]  It's as simple as that.
[01:27:32.288 --> 01:27:33.368]  We're taking it a step further.
[01:27:33.388 --> 01:27:37.809]  I mean, they were using churches in Chicago to hold German immigrants.
[01:27:38.683 --> 01:27:49.425]  You know, they have the actual prison cubes, the concrete prison cubes, that they can drop, like Legos, and build them up, overnight.
[01:27:50.326 --> 01:27:52.266]  And the feds, I mean, look, this is not our opinion.
[01:27:52.366 --> 01:27:55.947]  They admit, and they're setting it up where you're going to want to be in the camp.
[01:27:56.327 --> 01:28:01.128]  Like, oh, you're starving, you're not allowed to be homeless now, you've got to live in the camp.
[01:28:03.703 --> 01:28:06.406]  Yeah, so the film breaks it down.
[01:28:06.426 --> 01:28:11.730]  You know, obviously there's the inward facing barbed wire, the guard towers.
[01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:15.414]  I mean, these are staples of standard camps that are existing today.
[01:28:15.434 --> 01:28:21.159]  But what's most importantly is, you know, they can build these camps overnight, within 24 hours.
[01:28:21.179 --> 01:28:27.044]  Look, on record, the feds built the Robert Mueller Airport, and they have a large area designated.
[01:28:27.064 --> 01:28:28.526]  I have local news admitting it.
[01:28:29.949 --> 01:28:34.992]  I mean, they take facilities that have barbed wire, and that's the camp, and there's guys with machine guns there.
[01:28:35.032 --> 01:28:35.412]  Go ahead.
[01:28:37.613 --> 01:28:38.373]  Look, I mean, that's it.
[01:28:38.713 --> 01:28:40.214]  You're saying it right there.
[01:28:40.254 --> 01:28:40.654]  The camp?
[01:28:41.475 --> 01:28:45.877]  They've taken existing camps from the Clinton administration.
[01:28:46.037 --> 01:28:49.139]  When they decommissioned all those military bases, they converted those camps.
[01:28:49.599 --> 01:28:53.541]  They've converted countless other locations across the country.
[01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:57.983]  The civilian inmate labor program that Alex was talking with us about on the break.
[01:28:59.119 --> 01:29:00.340]  There's a lot of characteristics.
[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:01.500]  Check out the film for yourself.
[01:29:02.481 --> 01:29:06.663]  And the federal bill tries to legalize and fund what's already set up.
[01:29:06.783 --> 01:29:19.949]  Everything we always said the camps were and how they worked is mirrored in the congressional bill that says the old military bases, barbed wire, local police involved, army running it, a brig, family living areas.
[01:29:19.969 --> 01:29:22.950]  I mean, this is already happening in plain view.
[01:29:23.871 --> 01:29:25.772]  HR 645, right there.
[01:29:27.573 --> 01:29:28.213]  Take a look at it.
[01:29:28.795 --> 01:29:32.378]  Meanwhile, Media Matters just say it doesn't exist.
[01:29:32.398 --> 01:29:32.778]  Stay there.
[01:29:32.798 --> 01:29:38.042]  I hope that answers your question, Vincent, Sam, Virgil, Tony, Abel, Jeff, and others.
[01:29:38.082 --> 01:29:38.843]  Your call's coming up.
[01:29:38.863 --> 01:29:41.545]  But first, I want to hear... I've been asking the questions here.
[01:29:41.565 --> 01:29:46.628]  I want Gary Franchi and William Lewis just to make any comments they want about their film.
[01:29:47.429 --> 01:29:48.049]  Camp FEMA.
[01:29:48.610 --> 01:29:49.571]  InfoWars.com.
[01:29:51.312 --> 01:29:52.233]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.693 --> 01:29:54.294]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.235 --> 01:29:57.917]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.394 --> 01:30:03.997]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.397 --> 01:30:09.382]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.742 --> 01:30:11.464]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.784 --> 01:30:16.609]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.789 --> 01:30:17.710]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.950 --> 01:30:18.711]  When do you want it?
[01:30:19.091 --> 01:30:20.692]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.972 --> 01:30:21.792]  When will you need it?
[01:30:22.033 --> 01:30:24.114]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.254 --> 01:30:25.355]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.575 --> 01:30:26.916]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:27.116 --> 01:30:32.179]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.379 --> 01:30:35.561]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.962 --> 01:30:39.444]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.784 --> 01:30:40.764]  How much will you need?
[01:30:41.004 --> 01:30:41.624]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.905 --> 01:30:42.825]  How much do you want?
[01:30:43.005 --> 01:30:43.745]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.945 --> 01:30:44.785]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:45.045 --> 01:30:47.786]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:48.086 --> 01:30:50.247]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:50.267 --> 01:30:51.287]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.427 --> 01:31:05.594]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.734 --> 01:31:10.100]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:12.123]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.543 --> 01:31:13.885]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:14.165 --> 01:31:15.207]  There is a solution.
[01:31:15.427 --> 01:31:23.450]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:31:23.851 --> 01:31:30.933]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[01:31:37.336 --> 01:31:42.939]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:31:43.359 --> 01:31:47.160]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[01:32:01.367 --> 01:32:04.328]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:32:05.384 --> 01:32:05.845]  I think so.
[01:32:23.083 --> 01:32:23.523]  I think so.
[01:32:51.115 --> 01:32:53.697]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:32:53.717 --> 01:32:54.338]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y today.
[01:32:54.358 --> 01:32:56.059]  The establishment sees the republic as a snake.
[01:32:56.259 --> 01:32:58.121]  They want to cut the head off of the snake.
[01:33:21.357 --> 01:33:28.901]  But in each of us, in each of our hearts, lives the spirit of 1776 and true liberty and virtue and freedom against tyranny.
[01:33:30.202 --> 01:33:32.764]  So activate, get involved in the Info War today.
[01:33:32.864 --> 01:33:33.644]  Spread the word.
[01:33:34.164 --> 01:33:36.005]  We outnumber the enemy a thousand to one.
[01:33:36.386 --> 01:33:38.227]  But if we stand here idle, we will lose.
[01:33:40.008 --> 01:33:43.830]  I wanted... Yeah, there's a shot of the Gadsden flag, the Gadsden flag t-shirt we have available.
[01:33:43.850 --> 01:33:50.694]  It has the Thomas Jefferson quote on the back about the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots.
[01:33:51.312 --> 01:33:52.112]  And tyrants.
[01:33:53.013 --> 01:33:55.334]  The famous yellow flag with the snake on it.
[01:33:57.295 --> 01:34:04.898]  The Marine Corps was the first to use it in South Carolina while engaging British ships, in some cases 10 to 1.
[01:34:07.099 --> 01:34:11.321]  It's now demonized by the Department of Homeland Security as a symbol of terrorism.
[01:34:13.022 --> 01:34:15.423]  But I wanted to read to you what the founders said.
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:25.665]  In 1754, during the French and Indian War, Franklin published his famous woodcut of a snake cut into eight sections.
[01:34:26.145 --> 01:34:31.449]  It represented the colonies, with New England joined together at the head and the South Carolina at the tail.
[01:34:32.089 --> 01:34:37.233]  Following their order along the coast, under the snake, the message was, join or die.
[01:34:37.593 --> 01:34:41.536]  For PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, this was then used early on in the Revolutionary War.
[01:34:41.616 --> 01:34:45.919]  So, that's when the rattlesnake was first seen, then it was picked up in 1776 by the Marines.
[01:34:48.479 --> 01:34:49.379]  By the Marine Corps.
[01:34:50.759 --> 01:34:58.481]  And writing then, as the American Revolution grew closer, the snake began to see more use as a symbol for the colonies.
[01:34:58.501 --> 01:35:00.241]  It's the true symbol of America.
[01:35:00.741 --> 01:35:09.523]  In 1774, Paul Revere added it to the title of his paper, The Massachusetts Spy, as a snake joined to fight a British dragon.
[01:35:10.063 --> 01:35:15.664]  In December of 1775, Benjamin Franklin published an essay in the Pennsylvania Journal,
[01:35:21.090 --> 01:35:25.491]  Under the pseudonym, American Gossar.
[01:35:26.772 --> 01:35:29.632]  They're doing some audio testing in there today with the new audio system.
[01:35:29.672 --> 01:35:32.433]  I don't know if people are hearing that on air, but it's hard for me to talk with it doing that.
[01:35:32.893 --> 01:35:33.753]  I'm gonna start over now.
[01:35:34.854 --> 01:35:35.794]  Try as hard as I can here.
[01:35:37.595 --> 01:35:42.676]  As the American Revolution grew closer, the snake began to see more and more use as a symbol of the colonies.
[01:35:42.716 --> 01:35:50.238]  In 1774, Paul Revere added it to the title of his paper, The Massachusetts Spy, as a snake joined to fight a British dragon.
[01:35:52.873 --> 01:36:03.819]  In December 1775, Benjamin Franklin published an essay in the Pennsylvania Journal under the pseudonym American Gausser, in which he suggested that the rattlesnake was a good symbol of the American spirit.
[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:09.322]  This is Benjamin Franklin, now known as a terrorist by Homeland Security, literally.
[01:36:09.422 --> 01:36:12.364]  I have him on video being demonized by Homeland Security.
[01:36:13.525 --> 01:36:13.805]  FEMA.
[01:36:14.385 --> 01:36:15.426]  I recollect that
[01:36:16.755 --> 01:36:23.538]  Her eyes excelled in brightness that of any other animal, and that she has no eyelids.
[01:36:23.958 --> 01:36:26.980]  She may therefore be esteemed as an emblem of vigilance.
[01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:28.520]  See, eternally awake.
[01:36:29.061 --> 01:36:31.562]  She never begins an attack.
[01:36:32.322 --> 01:36:33.323]  See, this describes us.
[01:36:33.343 --> 01:36:34.003]  This describes me.
[01:36:34.303 --> 01:36:35.784]  This describes my spirit.
[01:36:36.204 --> 01:36:42.607]  She never begins an attack, nor, once engaged, ever surrenders.
[01:36:43.147 --> 01:36:44.808]  She is therefore an emblem of
[01:36:45.766 --> 01:36:47.927]  Magnanimity and true courage.
[01:36:49.228 --> 01:36:59.735]  As if anxious to prevent all pretensions of quarreling with her, the weapon which nature has furnished her, she conceals in the roof of her mouth.
[01:37:00.396 --> 01:37:05.739]  So that, to those who are unacquainted with her, she appears to be most defenseless animal.
[01:37:06.299 --> 01:37:13.384]  And even when those weapons are shown and extended for her defense, they appear weak and contemptible.
[01:37:14.324 --> 01:37:18.646]  But their wounds, however small, are decisive and fatal.
[01:37:19.926 --> 01:37:34.032]  Conscience this, of this, she never wounds till she has been grievously given notice, and generally given notice, even to her enemy, and cautioned him against the danger of treading on her.
[01:37:34.993 --> 01:37:40.835]  Was I wrong, sir, in thinking that a strong picture of the temper of the conduct of America?
[01:37:41.624 --> 01:37:46.028]  That's what the Gadsden flag is for all you sickening, degenerate traitors.
[01:37:46.308 --> 01:37:48.330]  I was wearing one out in L.A.
[01:37:48.370 --> 01:37:55.857]  and people were shrinking in fear because I guess they'd seen it on the news and asking what it was and, and, and, and, and, what's the shirt?
[01:37:57.919 --> 01:37:58.479]  Freedom!
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:00.501]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up now and go back.
[01:38:00.801 --> 01:38:03.183]  Gary Franchi, William Lewis, you have the floor.
[01:38:03.584 --> 01:38:07.087]  Your points about your new film, Camp FEMA.
[01:38:08.055 --> 01:38:16.066]  You know, the film itself, Alex, there's a segment on there with Chuck Baldwin talking about the MIAC report.
[01:38:16.506 --> 01:38:24.357]  Okay, I'm standing there, I'm listening to Chuck, you know, we're getting his feedback on being labeled a practical terrorist.
[01:38:24.963 --> 01:38:25.903]  You know, that's in the film.
[01:38:26.384 --> 01:38:39.409]  Um, you know, I sat down with an internment camp survivor for 60 minutes as he shared his heart-wrenching story of how he had to only gather up what he could carry with his bare hands and bring into the camp an American citizen.
[01:38:40.249 --> 01:38:40.549]  Okay?
[01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:44.170]  You know, that's in the film.
[01:38:44.811 --> 01:38:46.991]  You know, the evidence is there.
[01:38:47.492 --> 01:38:49.172]  You know, the pictures are there.
[01:38:49.953 --> 01:38:50.733]  It's all there, Alex.
[01:38:51.633 --> 01:38:53.875]  And it's terrifying, but it's true.
[01:38:53.895 --> 01:38:55.817]  The American people need to see it.
[01:38:57.859 --> 01:38:59.781]  Anyway, William, take the floor please.
[01:38:59.841 --> 01:39:01.022]  I can't take the floor.
[01:39:01.302 --> 01:39:13.614]  I think beyond all the legislation that we're talking about and the mindset and the documentation that we show that our, you know, Senate Oversight Committee hearings and things that, you know, you can't disprove,
[01:39:14.698 --> 01:39:25.402]  Besides all of this evidence that we've gathered up, there's one thing we haven't talked about, and that's the 2010 Census, which is coming up this next year.
[01:39:25.422 --> 01:39:39.627]  No one is mentioning the fact that in 1940, the government collected Census information from the Census Bureau and used it to profile American citizens and know whether you were 1.6%
[01:39:41.613 --> 01:39:42.634]  I don't think so.
[01:39:55.069 --> 01:39:55.429]  I don't
[01:40:11.824 --> 01:40:12.445]  I think so.
[01:40:29.947 --> 01:40:32.010]  This is what they want to do with the American people.
[01:40:32.250 --> 01:40:39.520]  And I'm not telling you not to answer any questions from the 2,000 census taker that comes to your door, but, you know, you have to be your own judge.
[01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:45.849]  You have to decide whether you're going to say there's three people living in this house, or you're going to sit down and fill out a 28-page form that says whether you own a firearm or not.
[01:40:46.593 --> 01:40:53.261]  And by the way, they've already, phase one in the last year, we would tell people this eight, nine months ago and they didn't believe us.
[01:40:53.301 --> 01:40:54.423]  Now it's national news.
[01:40:54.763 --> 01:40:56.165]  They come and mark your front door.
[01:40:56.705 --> 01:40:57.907]  Phase two is now beginning.
[01:40:57.947 --> 01:41:00.590]  They have at least, that we know of, ten different surveys.
[01:41:01.191 --> 01:41:03.574]  One has ten questions, another has forty-nine.
[01:41:04.572 --> 01:41:06.433]  One of them has over 200 questions.
[01:41:07.054 --> 01:41:09.415]  I got the 40-something question one.
[01:41:10.276 --> 01:41:11.697]  And this happened in 2000.
[01:41:11.757 --> 01:41:13.218]  Now it's happening to my neighbors again.
[01:41:13.278 --> 01:41:16.360]  They come to your door and threaten you with a plastic badge.
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:17.841]  You have a Fifth Amendment.
[01:41:18.562 --> 01:41:20.903]  Gary Franchi, you want to tell folks what the Fifth Amendment is?
[01:41:23.405 --> 01:41:28.669]  We have the right to be secure in our persons, in our homes, in our effects.
[01:41:29.249 --> 01:41:30.610]  They don't have the right to come up.
[01:41:31.250 --> 01:41:33.512]  If we don't want to answer the door, we don't have to answer the door.
[01:41:34.932 --> 01:41:45.618]  You know, recent information has been revealed to me that they are considering having a question in the census that says, do you own a firearm or not?
[01:41:45.659 --> 01:41:45.939]  No, no, no.
[01:41:45.959 --> 01:41:46.679]  That is in there.
[01:41:46.719 --> 01:41:48.060]  That was in the news in 2000.
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:51.082]  One of the census forms says, do you own firearms?
[01:41:51.142 --> 01:41:52.263]  No, I actually got it.
[01:41:52.643 --> 01:41:54.004]  There's videos of it on the web in 2000.
[01:41:54.144 --> 01:41:54.884]  No, no, no.
[01:41:54.924 --> 01:41:56.185]  It's there, Gary.
[01:41:56.905 --> 01:41:57.185]  It's there.
[01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:05.792]  You understand, though, they have an American Business Forum, they have an American Community Survey.
[01:42:06.532 --> 01:42:08.973]  There's ten of them on their website they admit to.
[01:42:09.793 --> 01:42:12.814]  I mean, I got one asking, do you have a low flush toilet?
[01:42:13.075 --> 01:42:14.455]  Do you have stocks and bonds?
[01:42:14.615 --> 01:42:15.295]  What are they?
[01:42:16.656 --> 01:42:25.779]  And, again, under federal law, they can only ask how many people live here to a portion the number of congressmen your state gets.
[01:42:26.593 --> 01:42:31.178]  Because California has the most, Texas second, Florida third, New York fourth.
[01:42:32.519 --> 01:42:33.620]  That's all it's for!
[01:42:34.121 --> 01:42:37.524]  Not, you know, what stocks and bonds do you have?
[01:42:37.564 --> 01:42:38.685]  We have a Fifth Amendment.
[01:42:38.886 --> 01:42:40.928]  We don't have to answer the police questions.
[01:42:46.694 --> 01:42:47.074]  It's time.
[01:42:47.875 --> 01:42:49.096]  The American people need to rise up.
[01:42:49.116 --> 01:42:49.897]  They are rising up.
[01:42:50.635 --> 01:42:52.936]  People are going to town hall meetings all across the country.
[01:42:53.196 --> 01:42:55.477]  There's a town hall meeting in Skokie, Jan Schakowsky.
[01:42:55.938 --> 01:42:58.979]  Everyone, if you're in the Chicago area, go out there and give her hell!
[01:42:59.579 --> 01:43:03.041]  We're not going to take this socialist agenda coming down from on high.
[01:43:03.301 --> 01:43:06.503]  We are going to preserve and protect the United States of America!
[01:43:06.523 --> 01:43:08.444]  Stand up now!
[01:43:09.204 --> 01:43:10.985]  Gary, you were telling me during a break about how
[01:43:12.130 --> 01:43:16.333]  Remember in Texas, they said the Lloyd Doggett thing was fake, and then now they have to admit it's not fake.
[01:43:16.373 --> 01:43:22.117]  The citizens are mad at the congressman and how they threw the first few women and men out, but then that made everybody else come out.
[01:43:22.637 --> 01:43:27.241]  Just like they were trying to arrest people putting up the Obama posters, but now they've had to back off.
[01:43:27.301 --> 01:43:32.024]  They realize that we run this country, and if we'll just exercise it, it's over.
[01:43:32.104 --> 01:43:33.365]  Gary Franchi, William Lewis.
[01:43:33.665 --> 01:43:34.686]  Comments, then we're going to calls.
[01:43:35.532 --> 01:43:39.354]  Alex, you know, that lady that was demonized by the mainstream media.
[01:43:39.554 --> 01:43:43.175]  She was demonized because she stood up and held a birth certificate to her congressman.
[01:43:43.636 --> 01:43:44.036]  You know what?
[01:43:44.416 --> 01:43:45.957]  What that did, that backfired on them.
[01:43:46.297 --> 01:43:54.780]  Because when they put that out across the country, when they put that out on all the mainstream media reports and they demonized her, the good people of America saw that for what it was.
[01:43:55.121 --> 01:43:58.922]  And now they're coming out to all the town halls and she was the example to set.
[01:43:59.222 --> 01:44:00.763]  And now everybody else is standing up.
[01:44:01.043 --> 01:44:02.464]  That woman is an American hero.
[01:44:03.396 --> 01:44:06.758]  That woman is an American hero, and everybody else needs to stand up just like her.
[01:44:07.438 --> 01:44:07.959]  It's time.
[01:44:09.099 --> 01:44:20.686]  And that's the key, and I want William to comment on this, and we're going to calls from the Netherlands and beyond, is that I've always said the last illusion to fall is that we as patriots are a minority.
[01:44:21.126 --> 01:44:29.992]  And as the people put up posters and go to town halls and call into radio and go to city council and do all these things and start websites and all this be heard,
[01:44:30.902 --> 01:44:32.683]  If you're heard by one person, that's victory.
[01:44:33.223 --> 01:44:37.925]  That now everybody's seeing we're the majority and the system used to try to demonize us.
[01:44:38.245 --> 01:44:50.491]  Now they're not doing that as much because they realize, oh God, that only angers them because the mind control, the mesmerized trance that people were under is breaking.
[01:44:50.551 --> 01:44:51.111]  William Lewis.
[01:44:52.233 --> 01:44:57.074]  Yeah, people keep in mind that this country was born out of political dissent.
[01:44:57.555 --> 01:45:06.017]  You know, they may be labeling George Washington and the founders of this country as terrorists, but in the Crown's eyes, that's what they were.
[01:45:06.417 --> 01:45:08.898]  In the government's eyes, that's what we are.
[01:45:09.098 --> 01:45:10.638]  It doesn't make us in the wrong.
[01:45:10.859 --> 01:45:18.901]  In fact, I think it's quite an honor these days to be labeled a potential domestic terrorist because it says you're standing up and saying the right thing.
[01:45:19.522 --> 01:45:24.586]  So, we can't let them intimidate us into not saying the things that need to be said.
[01:45:24.646 --> 01:45:26.707]  And this woman, like Gary said, is a hero.
[01:45:26.748 --> 01:45:28.189]  We need to all be standing up.
[01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:32.412]  We all need to be protesting what's going on in our government and speaking our mind.
[01:45:33.533 --> 01:45:36.015]  Well, I want to say something else than we are going to calls, and it's this.
[01:45:39.117 --> 01:45:48.364]  In 99% of the cases, and I mean it's literally those type of numbers now, when we hear about somebody putting up an Obama poster, we hear about somebody going to a town hall, or somebody shoots the video of the town hall,
[01:45:49.053 --> 01:45:53.296]  Or cops come over and say, you can't have that anti-Obama poster, but pro posters are allowed.
[01:45:54.076 --> 01:45:56.958]  Or somebody gets punched in the face and then stands up.
[01:45:57.358 --> 01:45:58.359]  It's my listeners.
[01:45:59.279 --> 01:46:08.485]  And I want to tell the listeners of this show, you are the second American revolution against the offshore banks' tyranny and trying to usurp this country.
[01:46:08.905 --> 01:46:11.267]  You are the only resistance.
[01:46:11.427 --> 01:46:12.848]  You are wonderful.
[01:46:13.948 --> 01:46:16.410]  And it is just such a blessing and such an honor
[01:46:17.475 --> 01:46:28.618]  to be able to talk to people like you and to be able to work with all these other great liberty activists and to be the focal point show and to have Media Matters and George Soros attacking me every day.
[01:46:29.599 --> 01:46:32.820]  It is such an honor and I'm trying to live up to that standard.
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:33.800]  I know I'm not perfect.
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:36.841]  None of us have all the answers, but we don't have to be perfect.
[01:46:36.861 --> 01:46:38.201]  We just got to take action.
[01:46:38.542 --> 01:46:42.143]  We know these tyrants are out of control and get the word out.
[01:46:42.443 --> 01:46:42.843]  Gentlemen,
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:50.718]  Alex, your listeners are a crucial, crucial part of this entire revolution.
[01:46:51.414 --> 01:46:52.815]  You know, people are standing up.
[01:46:53.315 --> 01:46:54.456]  People have seen your films.
[01:46:54.496 --> 01:46:56.197]  They've seen Russell's film.
[01:46:56.677 --> 01:46:59.279]  They've participated in the Ron Paul revolution.
[01:46:59.299 --> 01:47:03.362]  This is the second American revolution, Alex.
[01:47:03.982 --> 01:47:05.523]  I am damn proud to be a part of it.
[01:47:05.863 --> 01:47:07.404]  I'm damn proud to be on your team.
[01:47:07.744 --> 01:47:12.868]  And if somebody wants to come out and demonize me because I stand up for what's right and for the Constitution, I say bring it.
[01:47:13.208 --> 01:47:15.049]  I say bring it with full force because you know what?
[01:47:15.229 --> 01:47:17.571]  That's going to galvanize me to step up.
[01:47:17.591 --> 01:47:19.712]  It's going to galvanize the people to step up.
[01:47:20.032 --> 01:47:21.813]  And that's what's happening right now.
[01:47:22.274 --> 01:47:23.294]  God bless America.
[01:47:23.334 --> 01:47:28.458]  God bless America, and absolutely, and that's what's happening is people are realizing they have power.
[01:47:28.858 --> 01:47:35.843]  The system, when it attacks myself and Ron Paul and only a few other people, nationally now, that shows who the real enemy is.
[01:47:35.903 --> 01:47:46.611]  That shows that the whole eye of the New World Order is focused into the heart of its own empire, because if it can't keep its slaves in line, it fails, it falls.
[01:47:46.991 --> 01:47:47.912]  Sam in the Netherlands,
[01:47:48.212 --> 01:47:54.633]  You're on the air with William Lewis, the director and maker, and also his producer, Gary Franchi.
[01:47:54.673 --> 01:47:55.013]  Go ahead.
[01:47:57.474 --> 01:47:58.074]  Hi, Gary.
[01:47:58.194 --> 01:48:01.375]  I've met you before, emailed you in the past.
[01:48:02.615 --> 01:48:03.915]  And hi, Alex and William.
[01:48:04.715 --> 01:48:09.836]  I would like to just say that my ancestor from South Africa was probably in the first concentration camp.
[01:48:10.617 --> 01:48:12.237]  And now there's a new concentration camp.
[01:48:12.297 --> 01:48:12.777]  It's big.
[01:48:12.937 --> 01:48:17.798]  It's called Palestine, Gaza, and Israel created
[01:48:18.277 --> 01:48:21.399]  viruses against the Palestinians, also South Africa.
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:23.381]  What else can I say?
[01:48:23.441 --> 01:48:36.690]  Concentration camps are around us and it's all from the road, Cecil Road, building that first camp in South Africa, stupid Rothschild bootlicker and
[01:48:38.976 --> 01:48:40.197]  What else can I say?
[01:48:40.437 --> 01:48:41.997]  Well, I mean, I want to hear more of what you have to say.
[01:48:42.038 --> 01:48:42.858]  You make a great point.
[01:48:43.418 --> 01:48:44.499]  Look at South Africa.
[01:48:44.539 --> 01:48:45.959]  Look at some of the stuff Israel does.
[01:48:45.979 --> 01:48:48.140]  Look at what the Russians would do.
[01:48:48.461 --> 01:48:52.022]  They just lock off whole neighborhoods and don't let food and stuff in.
[01:48:52.042 --> 01:49:01.227]  And that's what they're saying under quarantine, which they're setting the... This is the excuse for the feds to train locals to accept the lockdowns of cities, whether it happens or not.
[01:49:02.052 --> 01:49:03.835]  Is that that's how they work this.
[01:49:03.895 --> 01:49:04.936]  That's how this is done.
[01:49:05.297 --> 01:49:12.547]  Whole areas of the world are locked down and they're admitting they're turning all of America into a giant FEMA camp.
[01:49:12.768 --> 01:49:13.329]  William Lewis.
[01:49:15.307 --> 01:49:21.230]  Yeah, look, we went to, you know, the really cream of the crop when we wanted to ask these types of questions.
[01:49:21.311 --> 01:49:29.775]  I mean, obviously, you're in it, John Stapmiller's in it, Chuck Baldwin, Michael Baden-Erich, but, you know, one surprising person that we had in here is Catherine Bleich.
[01:49:32.970 --> 01:49:36.071]  Here in Missouri, she's head of the Liberty Restoration Project.
[01:49:36.091 --> 01:49:39.953]  She goes to these MIAC hearings and presents her evidence.
[01:49:40.033 --> 01:49:41.713]  I mean, she actually testifies at these things.
[01:49:42.073 --> 01:49:54.398]  We have her today at the MIAC hearing in Kansas City, entering into evidence the Camp FEMA documentary that these people, since it's been entered into evidence, are going to have to sit down and watch.
[01:49:55.054 --> 01:49:56.375]  We're very excited about that.
[01:49:56.415 --> 01:50:00.338]  Katherine is really carrying the banner of liberty and freedom here in Missouri.
[01:50:00.358 --> 01:50:02.019]  She needs to be supported.
[01:50:02.259 --> 01:50:15.568]  We've got Larry Pratt in this thing, Michael Shaw with Freedom Advocates, Charlie Meadows who gets off onto the Agenda 21, 85% reduction in population, that whole agenda, James Lane with We Are Change, Jeffrey Grubb,
[01:50:16.384 --> 01:50:21.049]  Uh, and of course, uh, you know, our-our star that we consider our star, uh, Sam Lozaki, who was the U.S.
[01:50:21.149 --> 01:50:30.518]  internment camp survivor, who's the guy who actually lived through this once before and is here to give us the warning signs, tell us what to look for, what they did to them, and how we can combat it.
[01:50:30.998 --> 01:50:34.982]  And that's what we get into, uh, that's what we get into the 10th Amendment states, right?
[01:50:35.222 --> 01:50:36.563]  Like I said, this took place at, um...
[01:50:37.914 --> 01:50:40.638]  In Oklahoma City, this was a Freedom 21 conference.
[01:50:40.858 --> 01:50:45.883]  We've got the cream of the crop talking about this stuff, and I think people are going to be absolutely astounded.
[01:50:45.903 --> 01:50:47.605]  They're going to want to get up and take action.
[01:50:47.625 --> 01:50:49.568]  These guys present the right things to do.
[01:50:50.549 --> 01:50:51.330]  Beautiful job.
[01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:55.915]  We're going to come back, let Sam finish up, then Virgil, Tony, and a few other calls with our guest.
[01:50:56.824 --> 01:51:00.847]  It's Camp FEMA, available at Infowars.com on DVD right now.
[01:51:01.327 --> 01:51:02.628]  Are you constantly tired?

[01:51:04.770 --> 01:51:07.812]  Experience muscle weakness or have problems with digestion?
[01:51:08.052 --> 01:51:10.814]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.

[01:52:01.024 --> 01:52:04.648]  When looking at your personal preparedness level, remember The Freeze-Dry Guy.
[01:52:04.768 --> 01:52:11.696]  During times of physical and emotional stress, like the uncertain times we live in today, it is vital that you not alter your diet too much.
[01:52:11.936 --> 01:52:16.982]  You should only store what you usually eat, because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored.
[01:52:17.262 --> 01:52:19.104]  Lucky for you, there's The Freeze-Dry Guy.
[01:52:19.304 --> 01:52:25.607]  Featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect, the Freeze-Dry Guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods.
[01:52:25.787 --> 01:52:30.569]  All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time.
[01:52:30.749 --> 01:52:38.993]  The Freeze-Dry Guy has been serving various government agencies as well as the private sector with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[01:52:40.074 --> 01:52:46.777]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today.
[01:52:46.957 --> 01:52:47.497]  Comparably,
[01:52:47.517 --> 01:52:48.538]  May I have everybody's attention?
[01:53:02.594 --> 01:53:05.837]  Attention please, I've come with a message of information.
[01:53:05.857 --> 01:53:08.419]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:53:08.439 --> 01:53:09.640]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:53:09.660 --> 01:53:11.301]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:53:11.381 --> 01:53:14.224]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:53:14.284 --> 01:53:17.907]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:53:27.567 --> 01:53:32.470]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:53:32.670 --> 01:53:33.991]  An inside job!
[01:53:36.212 --> 01:53:37.313]  How dare you?
[01:53:37.453 --> 01:53:43.719]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:53:43.739 --> 01:53:46.562]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:53:46.642 --> 01:53:52.828]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[01:53:53.008 --> 01:53:55.690]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:53:55.951 --> 01:53:57.933]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:53:58.213 --> 01:54:00.695]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:54:07.230 --> 01:54:09.632]  Alright, as much as I love Merle Haggard, we're going to cut him off.
[01:54:12.034 --> 01:54:13.655]  And go right back to Sam with another one.
[01:54:13.715 --> 01:54:15.237]  Sam, anything else you wanted to add there?
[01:54:16.317 --> 01:54:20.361]  Yes, I have something to say also about the Second World War.
[01:54:20.961 --> 01:54:23.423]  With the camps, the six million Jews, that's a hoax.
[01:54:24.424 --> 01:54:26.666]  And we've got to wake up to this, you know?
[01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:28.790]  What do you think?
[01:54:28.810 --> 01:54:42.337]  Well, you know, I've actually read the writings of Hitler and studied a lot of stuff, and I know the Russians have gone back on some of the stories they told, but I mean, Hitler, I mean, you do believe he executed people and ran people into pits and shot them, right?
[01:54:42.517 --> 01:54:44.158]  Because that was the Nazis' own writings.
[01:54:44.218 --> 01:54:44.538]  Yes!
[01:54:45.279 --> 01:54:45.799]  He is!
[01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:48.721]  Yeah.
[01:54:48.761 --> 01:54:49.021]  Yeah.
[01:54:50.081 --> 01:54:51.342]  Alright, I appreciate your call, Sam.
[01:54:51.362 --> 01:54:52.082]  Good to hear from you.
[01:54:53.323 --> 01:54:57.025]  All these governments set up camps, and, uh,
[01:54:58.814 --> 01:55:00.434]  I mean, that's really the bottom line here.
[01:55:00.474 --> 01:55:03.575]  I mean, these camps are real being set up here in the United States.
[01:55:04.975 --> 01:55:09.916]  And it is true, the British invented camps actually didn't start in South Africa.
[01:55:10.456 --> 01:55:11.777]  That's when it got modernized.
[01:55:12.237 --> 01:55:13.457]  The British invented camps.
[01:55:13.497 --> 01:55:16.638]  They had slave camps here in the U.S., prison ship camps.
[01:55:19.538 --> 01:55:21.999]  Andrew Jackson's mother and brother died in a camp.
[01:55:23.450 --> 01:55:24.491]  They just starve you to death.
[01:55:24.531 --> 01:55:25.412]  So the British invented them.
[01:55:25.772 --> 01:55:26.793]  Virgil in Ohio.
[01:55:26.813 --> 01:55:28.974]  You're on the air with the makers of the film, Camp FEMA.
[01:55:28.994 --> 01:55:29.635]  Go ahead, Virgil.
[01:55:30.315 --> 01:55:31.036]  Oh, hello there.
[01:55:31.696 --> 01:55:31.917]  Hey!
[01:55:32.477 --> 01:55:35.019]  I don't know a whole lot about the FEMA camps.
[01:55:35.199 --> 01:55:36.100]  I'm just learning.
[01:55:37.521 --> 01:55:44.746]  And, uh, one, you was talking about an email or a website that I could go on.
[01:55:46.628 --> 01:55:50.591]  And it's gonna be hard for you to listen if you got the radio cranked up and listen to yourself at the same time.
[01:55:51.164 --> 01:55:53.345]  No, actually my wife's got the computer on.
[01:55:53.726 --> 01:55:56.748]  Okay, well I just heard myself, so I must be going crazy.
[01:55:57.929 --> 01:55:59.830]  Specifically, what website are you asking for?
[01:55:59.850 --> 01:56:03.892]  I'd like to know a little bit more about the FEMA camps.
[01:56:04.913 --> 01:56:10.357]  And then the whole purpose of me calling today was I'm calling on behalf of my dad.
[01:56:11.057 --> 01:56:11.397]  Okay.
[01:56:12.098 --> 01:56:18.082]  And I was trying to get people to realize how evil the government's getting to even the people in offices
[01:56:18.815 --> 01:56:22.557]  Locally, like in the state of Ohio where I live, what they're doing.
[01:56:23.177 --> 01:56:23.817]  What are they doing?
[01:56:24.257 --> 01:56:27.659]  And like the parole board, they're actually stealing men's lives.
[01:56:28.179 --> 01:56:32.981]  They're changing what they were put in for and then giving them more time.
[01:56:33.001 --> 01:56:38.904]  Yeah, I've seen that around the country where they add charges you were never convicted of
[01:56:40.422 --> 01:56:42.984]  Send me a local news article on that.
[01:56:43.044 --> 01:56:46.027]  Send it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[01:56:46.047 --> 01:56:46.948]  Good to hear from you, sir.
[01:56:47.888 --> 01:56:51.872]  The film Camp FEMA covers all the documents.
[01:56:52.833 --> 01:56:54.474]  I'm in the film going over the documents.
[01:56:54.874 --> 01:56:56.796]  Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[01:56:58.097 --> 01:57:00.759]  Let me ask Gary Franchi and William Lewis this.
[01:57:00.779 --> 01:57:05.844]  Have you seen the clip of Fox Radio host Alan Combs saying,
[01:57:07.068 --> 01:57:16.026]  He doesn't even believe army.mil is a real website, so even when the government's trying to hire camp workers, they're saying it's not real.
[01:57:16.587 --> 01:57:17.968]  That's in the documentary.
[01:57:18.008 --> 01:57:20.728]  We found a clever way to introduce people to that.
[01:57:21.009 --> 01:57:28.231]  We've got Combs, his own words, on his radio program talking about it, saying that he can't find the army.mil website.
[01:57:28.311 --> 01:57:34.213]  And of course, at the same time, we are, you know, we got a camera on the computer and we're going there physically shoving people.
[01:57:34.253 --> 01:57:34.914]  Yeah, it's real.
[01:57:35.454 --> 01:57:36.534]  So yeah, that's covered.
[01:57:37.074 --> 01:57:38.915]  And I think people will find that really funny.
[01:57:39.614 --> 01:57:41.096]  See, you did so much in this film.
[01:57:41.116 --> 01:57:42.378]  That's another thing I forgot about.
[01:57:42.638 --> 01:57:47.364]  You show folks how to Google it, and then you're on the Army site hiring people to run the camps.
[01:57:47.424 --> 01:57:50.588]  I mean, there's just so much denial going on out there.
[01:57:51.727 --> 01:58:01.118]  Well, I mean, it blew our minds when just a couple weeks ago, we got a National Guard posting, you know, a job posting for internment camp officers.
[01:58:01.499 --> 01:58:04.242]  You know, I called William up, I said, oh my God, you gotta see this.
[01:58:04.843 --> 01:58:05.103]  You know?
[01:58:05.123 --> 01:58:09.649]  I mean, the film was practically finished, and then here we get this bombshell dropped on us.
[01:58:10.209 --> 01:58:11.890]  I mean, this has fortified everything even more!
[01:58:29.291 --> 01:58:29.852]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:58:30.593 --> 01:58:31.033]  Great job.
[01:58:31.494 --> 01:58:33.876]  You better start all other callers, get back to you tomorrow.

[01:58:50.947 --> 01:58:54.931]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:55.191 --> 01:58:56.973]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:57.193 --> 01:59:05.481]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.722 --> 01:59:10.947]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:11.287 --> 01:59:12.909]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:13.129 --> 01:59:19.451]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.631 --> 01:59:30.393]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.693 --> 01:59:31.193]  That's right.
[01:59:31.454 --> 01:59:33.774]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[02:00:12.111 --> 02:00:13.151]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.671 --> 02:00:17.612]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.852 --> 02:00:21.973]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.334 --> 02:00:25.314]  Well, Mr. Sheen, I want to commend you for your courage.
[02:00:25.354 --> 02:00:26.275]  I want to thank you for doing this interview.
[02:00:26.295 --> 02:00:35.037]  I want to thank you for writing that letter to the President because our country, our society, our world has no future unless people start getting involved and getting informed.
[02:00:35.811 --> 02:00:42.616]  And you've just done an incredible amount of research, going through your letter with all the hyperlinks to official government documents and mainstream media.
[02:00:42.856 --> 02:00:44.517]  This stuff really is hidden in plain view.
[02:00:45.138 --> 02:00:50.181]  And tens of millions more people are now going to find out the truth about 9-11 because of what you've done.
[02:00:50.201 --> 02:00:52.983]  So I just want to thank you for spending time with us today and what you've done.
[02:00:53.263 --> 02:00:59.468]  Well, thank you for having me, Alex, and I'd just like to say in closing that I not only
[02:01:00.851 --> 02:01:26.379]  Encourage people to read my letter, but I I challenge them to read it And I challenge them to do their own research to cross-check their facts I challenge them to ask the hard questions and wake people up, and I challenge them to demand the truth The ball is in the American people's court I mean you've you put into Obama's court giving him a chance to the right thing but regardless as you said earlier We've done the right thing just
[02:01:26.986 --> 02:01:27.826]  Asking these questions.
[02:01:28.166 --> 02:01:28.727]  It's your right.
[02:01:28.827 --> 02:01:29.367]  It's your duty.
[02:01:29.707 --> 02:01:39.110]  It is the epitome of patriotism to love your country, but to question your government and what the history we've seen of them lying constantly, being caught lying on the WMDs and all of it.
[02:01:39.530 --> 02:01:46.592]  All I can say is thank God for people like you that have courage because in serious times like this, we need good men and women.
[02:01:47.213 --> 02:01:48.813]  Thomas Jefferson said it best.
[02:01:49.653 --> 02:01:51.674]  All the evil men and tyrants need to flourish.
[02:01:52.290 --> 02:01:53.811]  Is that good men and women do nothing.
[02:01:54.252 --> 02:01:56.894]  And thanks to good people like you, Charlie, we've got a fighting chance.
[02:01:56.954 --> 02:01:58.275]  At that time, I was on CNN.
[02:01:58.996 --> 02:01:59.756]  And then, of course, you know.
[02:02:00.497 --> 02:02:02.438]  And there's one other quote I love.
[02:02:02.799 --> 02:02:03.819]  And that was by Mark Twain.
[02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:07.803]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated and feared.
[02:02:08.503 --> 02:02:10.945]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him.
[02:02:11.386 --> 02:02:13.888]  Because then, it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[02:02:14.208 --> 02:02:16.270]  And you, Charlie Sheen, are a patriot.
[02:02:16.650 --> 02:02:18.071]  Thank you for spending this time with us today.
[02:02:18.571 --> 02:02:19.072]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:28.304]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, that was the 21-minute audio interview I did a few weeks ago at his home.
[02:02:28.344 --> 02:02:31.566]  We have a video that's pretty hard-hitting.
[02:02:31.586 --> 02:02:37.790]  Aaron's been spending a week on it, and it's a video of Charlie Sheen editing it together that's coming up tomorrow.
[02:02:38.671 --> 02:02:39.251]  Tomorrow.
[02:02:40.372 --> 02:02:46.876]  We're going to be playing that, and then Charlie Sheen for a full, at least 30-minute, maybe longer interview coming up.
[02:02:48.335 --> 02:02:50.137]  On Friday, on 9-1-1.
[02:02:50.177 --> 02:02:51.838]  Today is 9-9-9.
[02:02:54.380 --> 02:03:00.004]  Now, other issues I haven't gotten to... And Richard Gage is with us 30-40 minutes or so.
[02:03:00.165 --> 02:03:03.707]  When he leaves us, Obama to seal U.S.-U.N.
[02:03:03.747 --> 02:03:04.308]  relationship.
[02:03:04.328 --> 02:03:06.870]  Barack Obama will cement the new cooperative relationship between the U.S.
[02:03:06.910 --> 02:03:07.610]  and the United Nations.
[02:03:07.971 --> 02:03:11.353]  This month, he becomes the first American president to chair the 15-member Security Council.
[02:03:11.754 --> 02:03:12.494]  First time in history.
[02:03:12.534 --> 02:03:14.396]  See, everything's being put in his hands.
[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:21.904]  Power-wise, the whole police state, the NORTHCOM, Homeland Security, all the powers being massed in the President's hands.
[02:03:22.384 --> 02:03:27.307]  The topic for the summit level session of the Council, September 24th, is nuclear nonproliferation, nuclear disarmament.
[02:03:28.087 --> 02:03:30.509]  One of the several global challenges the U.S.
[02:03:30.549 --> 02:03:33.591]  now wants to see addressed, and so it goes on from there.
[02:03:33.611 --> 02:03:38.533]  But the Council is really about controlling tax rates worldwide, controlling currency rates, and that's actually in
[02:03:40.535 --> 02:03:43.736]  The Associated Press, also McClatchy Newspapers, reporting on it today.
[02:03:44.216 --> 02:03:47.477]  A year after financial crisis, a new world order emerges.
[02:03:48.437 --> 02:03:53.118]  And they're all over the news and other reports announcing world government through and by the banks.
[02:03:53.178 --> 02:03:58.419]  So, this makes me actually not shake, but shiver.
[02:03:58.619 --> 02:03:59.700]  I mean, I just shivered.
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:01.580]  It's all so real.
[02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:06.161]  They really are eugenicists, as the White House science czar's own textbook that he wrote shows.
[02:04:06.201 --> 02:04:07.522]  They really are wicked.
[02:04:07.562 --> 02:04:09.262]  I mean, the Gardasil really is killing people.
[02:04:10.501 --> 02:04:15.322]  And I just wish all the trolls and everybody else would just spend their time warning girls about Gardasil.
[02:04:16.323 --> 02:04:18.603]  We know it's killing them and maiming them and paralyzing them.
[02:04:20.164 --> 02:04:31.207]  Three years ago I was called a kook for reading the actual, two and a half, three years ago, reading the actual documents on air from the trials of the vaccine, the human papillomavirus vaccine, when it was killing people.
[02:04:32.387 --> 02:04:33.628]  And now it's all out in the news again.
[02:04:35.962 --> 02:04:42.504]  Then articles come out in ABC News that Merck, quote, has hit teams that, quote, seek and destroy doctors and scientists that expose them.
[02:04:42.564 --> 02:04:46.045]  And Merck says, oh, that's just a joke in our internal corporate minutes.
[02:04:47.685 --> 02:04:49.146]  Man, this is serious.
[02:04:50.646 --> 02:04:54.167]  Bayer Pharmaceutical knowingly shipped out all the AIDS-tainted blood to over a million people.
[02:04:54.227 --> 02:04:57.148]  I mean, this is just incredible who we're facing.
[02:04:57.188 --> 02:04:59.049]  We've got to wake up and face it.
[02:04:59.429 --> 02:05:00.089]  Demand the truth.
[02:05:01.257 --> 02:05:06.239]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:05:06.459 --> 02:05:10.261]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:10.481 --> 02:05:16.104]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:16.404 --> 02:05:21.267]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:21.467 --> 02:05:21.907]  Number three,
[02:05:22.367 --> 02:05:27.811]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:05:28.672 --> 02:05:31.334]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:05:31.574 --> 02:05:34.977]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.098 --> 02:05:39.701]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:05:39.941 --> 02:05:45.426]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:05:45.666 --> 02:05:50.230]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:06:01.089 --> 02:06:08.538]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:06:08.839 --> 02:06:14.606]  You can buy it at Here'sWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for $6 or the book for $10.

[02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:23.797]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:06:24.158 --> 02:06:28.002]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:06:28.222 --> 02:06:33.589]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:06:33.829 --> 02:06:35.611]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:06:35.911 --> 02:06:37.333]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:06:37.673 --> 02:06:39.916]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:06:40.196 --> 02:06:44.560]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:06:44.921 --> 02:06:48.304]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[02:06:48.625 --> 02:06:51.267]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:06:51.768 --> 02:06:53.190]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:06:53.650 --> 02:06:55.772]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:07:01.343 --> 02:07:03.945]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.365 --> 02:07:09.329]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.689 --> 02:07:11.430]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.751 --> 02:07:16.554]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.734 --> 02:07:17.655]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.915 --> 02:07:18.676]  When do you want it?
[02:07:19.036 --> 02:07:20.637]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.918 --> 02:07:21.758]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.998 --> 02:07:24.080]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:25.301]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.541 --> 02:07:26.882]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:27.063 --> 02:07:32.147]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:32.347 --> 02:07:35.530]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.930 --> 02:07:39.393]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.733 --> 02:07:40.713]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.954 --> 02:07:41.574]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.854 --> 02:07:42.774]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.974 --> 02:07:43.695]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.715 --> 02:07:44.755]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.995 --> 02:07:47.756]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:48.036 --> 02:07:49.157]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:50.137 --> 02:07:55.319]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:55.579 --> 02:07:56.580]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:56.720 --> 02:08:06.564]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.904 --> 02:08:09.185]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:13.476 --> 02:08:18.462]  Well, the 8th anniversary of the tragic staged terror attacks of 9-11 is approaching.
[02:08:19.083 --> 02:08:25.491]  The 8th anniversary, I would just remind people that we were called conspiracy theorists just three years ago for saying the Gulf of Tonkin was staged.
[02:08:25.792 --> 02:08:28.655]  It's now declassified that those were staged attacks on our ships.
[02:08:29.296 --> 02:08:29.957]  To blame it,
[02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:37.241]  On the Vietnamese to start the Vietnam War that killed over a million and a half Vietnamese and over 58,000 Americans, injuring over 200,000 Americans.
[02:08:37.261 --> 02:08:45.743]  I just want to point out Operation Ajax staged terror attacks that were blamed on the government of Iran is declassified at the CIA's own history section.
[02:08:47.064 --> 02:08:53.125]  I just want to point out that it's now been declassified by the NSA that the USS Liberty attack was staged to be blamed on Egypt.
[02:08:53.989 --> 02:08:56.852]  That came out years after many people exposed it.
[02:08:57.212 --> 02:08:58.813]  Long before I was on the scene, it was exposed.
[02:08:58.834 --> 02:09:00.195]  20-something, 30 years ago.
[02:09:00.555 --> 02:09:01.356]  Well, that happened in 67.
[02:09:01.716 --> 02:09:02.837]  It was exposed from day one.
[02:09:03.378 --> 02:09:04.238]  That's now come out.
[02:09:06.140 --> 02:09:07.881]  Operation Northwoods has been declassified.
[02:09:07.902 --> 02:09:08.182]  The U.S.
[02:09:08.202 --> 02:09:09.323]  government planned to bomb U.S.
[02:09:09.363 --> 02:09:12.446]  cities and crash jets and blame it on foreign enemies.
[02:09:13.226 --> 02:09:14.367]  That's been declassified.
[02:09:15.508 --> 02:09:20.693]  And Army Field Manual from 2004 has been declassified, where it talks about how to stage false flag terror attacks.
[02:09:22.228 --> 02:09:30.235]  It's come out that six of the ten 9-11 Commission members even told the Washington Post that the 9-11 Commission was a fraud and a lie and a cover-up and needed to be criminally investigated.
[02:09:30.295 --> 02:09:32.237]  It's even been in the news but never gets any traction.
[02:09:32.637 --> 02:09:33.698]  Never becomes a big issue.
[02:09:35.119 --> 02:09:38.402]  We can't just sit here idly by and let all this continue.
[02:09:39.403 --> 02:09:43.147]  So my point is you're crazy to not know about the history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:09:43.447 --> 02:09:47.811]  You're crazy to not know about
[02:09:48.835 --> 02:09:55.579]  All the cases out there, where Hitler firebombed his own Reichstag in 33, February 27th, to get police state going in Germany.
[02:09:56.099 --> 02:10:01.743]  Or how Stalin staged terror attacks, or how the Tsarist, one of their favorite tactics was to stage terror attacks and blame it on their enemies.
[02:10:02.183 --> 02:10:07.726]  Or how British intelligence has now been declassified and caught staging many of the IRA bombings, some were real.
[02:10:09.207 --> 02:10:14.330]  Or, Haaretz and Jerusalem Post admit that, quote, Israel headline created fake Al-Qaeda groups.
[02:10:15.655 --> 02:10:16.935]  Every time there's about to be a peace deal.
[02:10:17.156 --> 02:10:20.036]  There is, of course, real terrorism in Israel going on, and it's terrible.
[02:10:20.056 --> 02:10:24.518]  But the point is, Israeli papers admit the government's been caught staging it at key points.
[02:10:26.439 --> 02:10:27.759]  That's what we're talking about here.
[02:10:28.119 --> 02:10:29.359]  And then you look at the science.
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:39.063]  The establishment likes to do these hit pieces on the science, because they know the general public aren't architects or engineers or physicists or underwriting laboratories people like Kevin Ryan.
[02:10:39.603 --> 02:10:43.284]  They can shoot a missile into a chicken coop and say it would have blown the Pentagon up.
[02:10:43.965 --> 02:10:48.429]  They can show you a three-story building and say, if we would have blown it up, we would have found debt court.
[02:10:49.590 --> 02:11:00.538]  I mean, they can do so many little things, little gimmicks, or say, we're crazy and just want to believe this, when the history that we have is a continual chain of staged terror attacks.
[02:11:01.599 --> 02:11:07.504]  Now, on the Charlie Sheen issue, and we're going to Richard Gage, this is less than 24 hours after the media picked this up.
[02:11:07.524 --> 02:11:09.205]  They picked it up first in the afternoon yesterday.
[02:11:09.225 --> 02:11:12.528]  At about 4 o'clock, we saw the first mainstream news stories.
[02:11:14.558 --> 02:11:22.520]  20 hours into this, or 21 hours into this, Fox News, Charlie Sheen seeks meeting with Obama to discuss 9-1-1 cover-up.
[02:11:25.841 --> 02:11:26.722]  Look at this story out of E!
[02:11:26.882 --> 02:11:30.703]  Entertainment, front page, Charlie Sheen, the truther, teaches Obama about 9-11.
[02:11:33.482 --> 02:11:33.702]  U.S.
[02:11:33.742 --> 02:11:34.623]  News and World Report.
[02:11:34.683 --> 02:11:37.444]  Charlie Sheen joins the Truth or 9-1-1 conspiracy theory fringe.
[02:11:37.464 --> 02:11:38.024]  Attack piece.
[02:11:38.584 --> 02:11:38.824]  L.A.
[02:11:38.884 --> 02:11:39.345]  Times.
[02:11:39.805 --> 02:11:40.925]  Top of the ticket section.
[02:11:40.985 --> 02:11:41.946]  Top political news.
[02:11:42.286 --> 02:11:42.646]  Breaking.
[02:11:42.666 --> 02:11:45.607]  Charlie Sheen demands Obama meeting on 9-1-1 cover-up.
[02:11:48.949 --> 02:11:49.549]  Here's another one.
[02:11:49.569 --> 02:11:52.630]  Charlie Sheen, fantasy 9-1-1 truth or grilling of the president.
[02:11:52.971 --> 02:11:53.371]  Gawker.
[02:11:56.072 --> 02:11:57.653]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[02:11:57.973 --> 02:12:00.674]  President Obama, Charlie Sheen, Van Jones, 9-1-1 truth movement.
[02:12:02.156 --> 02:12:03.717]  This is out of Associated Content.
[02:12:05.898 --> 02:12:07.098]  And it goes on and on.
[02:12:07.639 --> 02:12:08.179]  Here's one.
[02:12:08.199 --> 02:12:10.740]  I mean, there's just so many of these.
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:12.481]  The Houston Chronicle.
[02:12:15.823 --> 02:12:18.304]  It's just, there's just too many to cover them all.
[02:12:18.364 --> 02:12:19.244]  Very, very exciting.
[02:12:19.584 --> 02:12:23.066]  That's why Charlie wrote the letter about a meeting with the President.
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:27.663]  So that it would become a big issue of him wanting to actually meet with the President.
[02:12:27.723 --> 02:12:31.587]  That's what he talked about earlier when he was live on the show, in the tape interview we just aired.
[02:12:31.967 --> 02:12:34.429]  That's the whole point of what we're doing.
[02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:35.810]  Okay?
[02:12:36.451 --> 02:12:39.493]  Is to get people to look at those 20 points in the 20 questions of the President.
[02:12:39.854 --> 02:12:41.155]  And it was all Charlie's idea.
[02:12:41.735 --> 02:12:44.518]  Every bit of it was done exactly the way he wanted.
[02:12:45.258 --> 02:12:48.341]  And it was a genius idea, even a brilliant idea.
[02:12:48.401 --> 02:12:52.104]  Even people criticizing him and don't agree with 9-1-1 Truth are saying it was very well written.
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:56.561]  So, it's very exciting.
[02:12:56.581 --> 02:12:57.522]  Let's go to Richard Gage.
[02:12:57.562 --> 02:12:59.504]  Richard, I appreciate you coming on.
[02:13:00.485 --> 02:13:02.226]  First off, the Charlie Seen situation.
[02:13:02.666 --> 02:13:03.527]  What's your take on it?
[02:13:05.168 --> 02:13:14.076]  Well, we need people in the entertainment world, in Hollywood, talking about 9-11 truth.
[02:13:14.256 --> 02:13:17.258]  And Charlie began this, what, four years ago?
[02:13:17.278 --> 02:13:18.119]  Five years ago?
[02:13:18.139 --> 02:13:18.760]  Three and a half, yeah.
[02:13:19.670 --> 02:13:20.290]  Three and a half.
[02:13:20.330 --> 02:13:26.753]  He took so much heat for this that he had to back off until there was more support at a grassroots level.
[02:13:26.833 --> 02:13:27.954]  And we've got that now.
[02:13:27.994 --> 02:13:36.578]  We've got 830 architects and engineers backing him up, saying, yes, these buildings came down by explosive controlled demolition.
[02:13:36.618 --> 02:13:40.440]  So with all of this support and others, of course, across the 9-11 Truth Movement,
[02:13:40.740 --> 02:13:41.881]  Well, it certainly is, my friend.
[02:14:11.084 --> 02:14:12.244]  So much is going on.
[02:14:12.364 --> 02:14:15.285]  So much is happening right now.
[02:14:16.245 --> 02:14:22.786]  Let's get into... There's several new hit pieces for Discovery Channel and History Channel and A&E that are being made.
[02:14:22.846 --> 02:14:24.267]  PBS is making another hit piece.
[02:14:24.307 --> 02:14:28.228]  The British have made six in the last year and a half that I know of.
[02:14:28.268 --> 02:14:29.648]  Just absolutely ridiculous.
[02:14:30.708 --> 02:14:32.428]  All of that is going on and happening.
[02:14:33.389 --> 02:14:37.729]  And then at the same time, we have this latest big budget.
[02:14:38.090 --> 02:14:39.890]  And I was reading it was funded by Dubai.
[02:14:40.743 --> 02:14:47.106]  Our foreign country, with this really shoddy hour-long special that spends a half of it on our psychology.
[02:14:47.707 --> 02:14:54.030]  And they played all sorts of little tricks with the camera, all sorts of things they did, the way they always made it your opinion.
[02:14:54.210 --> 02:14:56.471]  We talked Sunday, but I want you to recap and expand on that.
[02:14:57.031 --> 02:15:00.853]  How you gave them all the evidence, all the facts, and they would never allow that to be shown in the show.
[02:15:01.293 --> 02:15:05.636]  I mean, really outrageous, but I think it's backfiring on them.
[02:15:05.656 --> 02:15:10.278]  And it was made by a famous production house that specializes just in hit pieces and, quote,
[02:15:11.010 --> 02:15:13.172]  Well, we've been speaking all across the country now for three years.
[02:15:41.445 --> 02:15:46.728]  We've had over 110 presentations to thousands and thousands of people.
[02:15:47.168 --> 02:15:58.654]  We've toured Europe with nine cities in Europe, and next month we're going to Japan, Australia, and New Zealand for November.
[02:16:00.933 --> 02:16:11.540]  The key senator, Senator Yukihisa Fujita, whose party just won, took over their government, basically.
[02:16:12.361 --> 02:16:13.561]  It was a minority party.
[02:16:15.663 --> 02:16:18.684]  This party is transforming Japan right now.
[02:16:18.744 --> 02:16:25.809]  It's kind of like the revolution we had, not revolution, the change we had from the Democrats to the Republicans, excuse me, Republicans to Democrats.
[02:16:26.289 --> 02:16:29.232]  So, he's bringing us to Tokyo and Kyoto.
[02:16:29.252 --> 02:16:30.132]  He'll introduce us.
[02:16:30.212 --> 02:16:39.520]  I mean, this is a huge opportunity for the 9-11 Truth Movement because he himself has been traveling around the world talking about 9-11 Truth.
[02:16:40.161 --> 02:16:45.465]  And so we're very excited to speak in 14 different cities all together in Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.
[02:16:45.525 --> 02:16:46.846]  And let me just throw a caveat in.
[02:16:48.728 --> 02:16:54.593]  As of a year ago, when he first went public and we interviewed him here as well, and he's since traveled to New York and other major cities of the world,
[02:16:56.300 --> 02:17:01.446]  He was the number three person in his party in the diet.
[02:17:01.947 --> 02:17:08.315]  Now his party, after decades and decades out of power, is now in power.
[02:17:08.896 --> 02:17:12.300]  And as you said, the president of his party is now the president of the country.
[02:17:13.101 --> 02:17:29.097]  So we need to go look at the power structure, but I believe he's number two now in the Japanese government, is a 9-11 truther who shows clips and clips of your films and clips of Professor Stephen Jones repeatedly in the Diet, in their Congress.
[02:17:29.177 --> 02:17:35.363]  I mean this, and this is all over Japanese TV, they came and interviewed me many times, but I mean this is incredible!
[02:17:38.714 --> 02:17:43.317]  I'm excited about it too, and we get to go there and be right in the middle of it and learn a whole lot more about it.
[02:17:43.558 --> 02:17:50.443]  In fact, they're booking the Diet itself, the governmental body, the building.
[02:17:50.563 --> 02:17:51.804]  We're going to be speaking there.
[02:17:52.044 --> 02:17:54.086]  That's the plan at this point.
[02:17:54.446 --> 02:18:00.771]  Not to their government, but having the public come to that place.
[02:18:01.492 --> 02:18:02.272]  Unbelievable.
[02:18:02.292 --> 02:18:06.856]  So that would be like having a huge 9-11 truth investigation in the House or in the Senate.
[02:18:07.386 --> 02:18:07.666]  Yeah!
[02:18:07.966 --> 02:18:08.607]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:18:08.627 --> 02:18:10.829]  I mean, that's pretty exciting.
[02:18:11.129 --> 02:18:15.192]  So we'll try to put something very special together for that.
[02:18:16.413 --> 02:18:25.680]  Last night, I had the opportunity to speak to a packed house of 200 at the Commonwealth Club of California.
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:27.161]  We webcast this live.
[02:18:27.181 --> 02:18:28.663]  We had 435 people listening live also from home.
[02:18:33.698 --> 02:18:34.038]  I think so.
[02:18:52.376 --> 02:18:53.398]  I don't think so.
[02:19:07.043 --> 02:19:23.739]  That I spent an hour with him highlighting the evidence of the free-fall acceleration of World Trade Center 7, you know, and the pools of molten iron that are found underneath it, and the Twin Towers.
[02:19:24.458 --> 02:19:42.706]  And all of this evidence, the massive expulsion of perimeter wall sections, 600 feet at 70 miles an hour, instant acceleration out of the side of the Twin Towers, no floors found at the bottom of the Twin Towers, pulverized concrete, 90,000 tons of it.
[02:19:43.186 --> 02:19:45.287]  Richard, we got a break here in about 15 seconds.
[02:19:45.347 --> 02:19:45.827]  Stay there.
[02:19:45.847 --> 02:19:46.608]  We're going to come back.
[02:19:46.628 --> 02:19:49.169]  Because you talked about this Sunday, but a lot of people didn't hear it.
[02:19:50.251 --> 02:19:51.612]  about this guy being a big liar.
[02:19:51.893 --> 02:19:57.177]  So, directly from Richard Gage, you're gonna hear what happened when we get back after this quick break.
[02:19:57.197 --> 02:19:57.578]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.226 --> 02:20:03.268]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:20:03.408 --> 02:20:04.168]  Spy on me?
[02:20:04.268 --> 02:20:04.549]  Yeah.
[02:20:04.589 --> 02:20:09.512]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[02:20:09.633 --> 02:20:11.114]  You should use StartPage instead.
[02:20:11.274 --> 02:20:11.934]  StartPage?
[02:20:12.014 --> 02:20:13.415]  Yeah, StartPage.com.
[02:20:13.536 --> 02:20:16.338]  The new name for XQuick, the world's most private search engine.
[02:20:16.498 --> 02:20:20.221]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[02:20:20.361 --> 02:20:23.283]  Plus, StartPage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[02:20:23.483 --> 02:20:25.865]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[02:20:26.105 --> 02:20:27.606]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[02:20:27.726 --> 02:20:27.947]  Right!
[02:20:28.007 --> 02:20:30.989]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[02:20:31.325 --> 02:20:32.865]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:33.246 --> 02:20:36.727]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[02:20:37.087 --> 02:20:40.728]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the 1 Week Start Page Challenge.
[02:20:40.888 --> 02:20:45.829]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[02:20:46.030 --> 02:20:48.990]  Try 7 days of Start Page and break the big brother habit.
[02:20:49.431 --> 02:20:50.991]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[02:20:51.191 --> 02:20:55.092]  Try StartPage.com for 7 days and start protecting your privacy.
[02:20:55.472 --> 02:20:57.053]  That's StartPage.com.
[02:21:01.004 --> 02:21:03.465]  The phone rings and the questions are asked.
[02:21:03.765 --> 02:21:04.725]  I've been so sick.
[02:21:05.026 --> 02:21:06.426]  Will the life change tea help me?
[02:21:06.706 --> 02:21:08.127]  Our answer is always the same.
[02:21:08.567 --> 02:21:14.249]  Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water and air are attacking you this very moment.
[02:21:14.689 --> 02:21:20.192]  Fight back with our all natural detoxifying tea that works immediately.
[02:21:20.572 --> 02:21:24.793]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[02:21:25.094 --> 02:21:26.054]  We use results.
[02:21:26.474 --> 02:21:30.936]  Life Change Tease formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[02:21:31.256 --> 02:21:35.538]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[02:21:35.858 --> 02:21:39.339]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[02:21:39.740 --> 02:21:43.201]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.
[02:21:43.621 --> 02:21:44.241]  Our number is 928-308-0408.
[02:21:48.573 --> 02:21:50.854]  Again, that's 928-308-0408.
[02:21:51.594 --> 02:21:55.235]  Or you can order online at GetTheTea.com.
[02:21:55.335 --> 02:21:57.676]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[02:21:57.876 --> 02:22:00.497]  And remember, we have the cheapest shipping in the industry.
[02:22:00.917 --> 02:22:02.698]  There are many guarantees in this world.
[02:22:02.938 --> 02:22:06.419]  The closest I can come to a guarantee is that the dollar is going to zero.
[02:22:06.499 --> 02:22:13.882]  During the Great Hyperinflation in Weimar, Germany, people who had worked all their lives and invested conservatively were wiped out, reduced to poverty.
[02:22:14.042 --> 02:22:16.804]  There are many parallels between the Weimar and the U.S.
[02:22:16.844 --> 02:22:17.145]  today.
[02:22:17.345 --> 02:22:18.145]  I'll send you a list.
[02:22:18.245 --> 02:22:27.072]  There are ways to protect yourself from hyperinflation, gold and silver, and legal and constitutional ways to avoid confiscation, which is becoming highly probable.
[02:22:27.272 --> 02:22:29.354]  I'm Bob Moss with Midas Resources.
[02:22:29.634 --> 02:22:34.659]  Many of the people I talked to today are aware of trouble coming, but haven't taken action to protect themselves.
[02:22:34.819 --> 02:22:39.763]  There is, in fact, a financial tsunami coming, and it could fall upon us quickly with a little warning.
[02:22:39.904 --> 02:22:40.764]  Don't procrastinate.
[02:22:40.804 --> 02:22:41.445]  Protect yourself.
[02:22:41.725 --> 02:22:42.326]  Call me today.
[02:22:42.426 --> 02:22:43.106]  Bob Moss at 800-686-2237.
[02:22:43.126 --> 02:22:43.587]  Extension 111.
[02:22:48.151 --> 02:22:53.915]  That's Bob Moss, Midas Resources, 800-686-2237, extension 111.
[02:22:54.696 --> 02:22:59.819]  Again, that's Bob Moss, 800-686-2237, extension 111.
[02:23:01.441 --> 02:23:02.842]  It is a big idea.
[02:23:02.862 --> 02:23:04.963]  A new world order.
[02:23:05.684 --> 02:23:10.507]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:23:10.587 --> 02:23:12.348]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:23:13.389 --> 02:23:15.571]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:23:16.181 --> 02:23:18.625]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[02:23:19.367 --> 02:23:26.680]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:23:29.704 --> 02:23:34.687]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:23:35.148 --> 02:23:38.630]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:23:39.070 --> 02:23:43.513]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:23:43.573 --> 02:23:45.234]  In Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:23:45.254 --> 02:23:46.475]  You have been warned.
[02:24:06.029 --> 02:24:07.330]  They came and took it all away.
[02:24:07.590 --> 02:24:25.704]  Look at all these articles from people watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, LA Times, Fox News, Reuters.
[02:24:31.383 --> 02:24:36.725]  Houston Chronicle, breaking Charlie Sheen demands Obama meeting on 9-1-1 cover-up.
[02:24:38.566 --> 02:24:41.627]  Again, if he just came out for 9-1-1 Truth again, there wouldn't be as much attention.
[02:24:41.647 --> 02:24:45.549]  But he comes out and wants to talk to Obama, it ignites a massive debate.
[02:24:45.589 --> 02:24:49.770]  That was his idea and it's much bigger than the last time he went public.
[02:24:49.931 --> 02:24:51.871]  24 hours into this, it is just exploding.
[02:24:53.452 --> 02:24:54.232]  Very, very exciting.
[02:24:54.252 --> 02:25:00.975]  Going back to Richard Gage, because I have this article here, Richard, I want to get back into the science and this guy saying, promising you he'd put
[02:25:02.395 --> 02:25:08.721]  Your science and your evidence in the film, and even showing you a rough cut that did have it, and saying that was the cut.
[02:25:10.202 --> 02:25:20.913]  But have you seen where the federal government is going to indoctrinate kids on 9-11 and how the Police State and Patriot Act are good as part of 9-11 federally funded courses in the public schools?
[02:25:21.573 --> 02:25:23.095]  No, I'm not aware of that, Alex.
[02:25:23.815 --> 02:25:24.736]  We're going to cover that later.
[02:25:24.756 --> 02:25:26.098]  We'll continue.
[02:25:26.158 --> 02:25:26.758]  So recap.
[02:25:28.044 --> 02:25:33.631]  Creative Differences, the production company that did the piece for National Geographic TV, the hit piece.
[02:25:33.671 --> 02:25:35.553]  First they said it wasn't a hit piece, it was going to be fair.
[02:25:35.834 --> 02:25:37.075]  They promised they'd show your science.
[02:25:37.215 --> 02:25:37.596]  Continue.
[02:25:38.396 --> 02:25:56.204]  Well yeah, they brought us down for the first interview and I just mentioned before the break that we carefully laid out all of this information for them and they're asking very intelligent questions and they're nodding and he was aware that we were telling the truth and he was very impressed by it.
[02:25:56.324 --> 02:25:58.405]  I have to tell you that this guy knows
[02:25:59.085 --> 02:25:59.886]  What's going on?
[02:25:59.926 --> 02:26:06.431]  This is not some kind of unconscious skepticism or something.
[02:26:07.312 --> 02:26:21.683]  Four months later, we're invited back because he wants to show us the rough cut because he has had criticism in the past where he felt, he said people have thought that they're
[02:26:22.356 --> 02:26:25.757]  Their interviews were taken out of context and so forth.
[02:26:26.098 --> 02:26:37.362]  So he brings us back, and actually, I'm watching myself in the rough cut with all of this evidence, and I'm delighted, because, you know, we're talking about molten metal.
[02:26:37.562 --> 02:26:41.644]  We're talking about nanothermite chips found in the dust.
[02:26:41.704 --> 02:26:44.845]  Very high-tech stuff, not made in a cave in Afghanistan.
[02:26:44.885 --> 02:26:50.067]  I think your next hour's guest, Steve Jones, will be talking in detail about that.
[02:26:50.836 --> 02:27:01.824]  But I told him about the small, previously molten iron spheres the size of a human hair that are found in all the dust samples, ignited thermites by chemical analysis.
[02:27:01.924 --> 02:27:03.765]  Anyway, all of this was in there.
[02:27:06.427 --> 02:27:07.468]  We're delighted, right?
[02:27:08.329 --> 02:27:12.092]  And then he brings out these experiments that he's done.
[02:27:12.112 --> 02:27:22.281]  Emmerich, who's really nothing more than a defense contractor at New Mexico, because they're like Lawrence Livermore Lab or something.
[02:27:22.602 --> 02:27:24.463]  All of their money comes from defense.
[02:27:25.024 --> 02:27:26.185]  They're on the government payroll!
[02:27:26.747 --> 02:27:27.408]  That's for sure.
[02:27:27.929 --> 02:27:29.912]  And so they have these three experiments.
[02:27:30.132 --> 02:27:33.617]  They never talked to us about what experiments they might be doing.
[02:27:34.758 --> 02:27:38.143]  They didn't get our input at all.
[02:27:38.163 --> 02:27:39.985]  We're just watching these experiments.
[02:27:40.006 --> 02:27:43.711]  So they lure you back to see the rough cut and it's these experiments?
[02:27:44.847 --> 02:27:52.971]  Yeah, then we see the rough cut, and we're delighted with what we were shown of ourselves, and then these experiments come on, and we're going, what the heck is this?
[02:27:53.051 --> 02:27:57.434]  Because we're... And by the way, they're videotaping your response.
[02:27:57.454 --> 02:27:59.155]  They're like, come see the rough cut, now come in here.
[02:27:59.415 --> 02:28:01.116]  We want to show you some other clips.
[02:28:01.136 --> 02:28:02.476]  I mean, is that how this happened?
[02:28:02.516 --> 02:28:03.897]  And then really they're videotaping you?
[02:28:04.297 --> 02:28:11.521]  Yes, and the intent was not that they were going to use our responses in the final version.
[02:28:11.541 --> 02:28:13.142]  The intent was that
[02:28:13.857 --> 02:28:14.497]  What did he say?
[02:28:16.058 --> 02:28:19.480]  We just want a record that you're happy with what you saw, basically.
[02:28:19.820 --> 02:28:21.781]  So this is a manipulation, clearly.
[02:28:22.482 --> 02:28:39.091]  And I have to tell you, this thermite experiment, for instance, where they, excuse me, the beam, where they put this 8-inch tall I-beam across 500 gallons of jet fuel and light it,
[02:28:39.986 --> 02:28:53.071]  But a 3,000 pound load in the middle of this I-beam, and we have in a couple of minutes temperatures rising very high and causing the failure of this beam.
[02:28:53.711 --> 02:29:05.136]  Well, first of all, had they talked to us, and even if they didn't talk to us, they should have known that NIST, in their investigation, hired Underwriter Laboratories to develop
[02:29:05.854 --> 02:29:13.241]  An exact replica of the floor truss system with a composite deck of concrete and metal decking.
[02:29:14.422 --> 02:29:21.287]  And they had under laboratory conditions, ASTM E-119 is the test number.
[02:29:21.568 --> 02:29:28.714]  They put 2,000 degrees of fire under the truss and twice the known amount of loading on top of the floor system.
[02:29:29.692 --> 02:29:30.153]  Stay there.
[02:29:30.233 --> 02:29:31.033]  This is scientific.
[02:29:31.093 --> 02:29:32.234]  I don't want to interrupt this.
[02:29:32.294 --> 02:29:34.656]  Yes, the underwriting laboratories found it wouldn't happen.
[02:29:35.016 --> 02:29:38.498]  But see, one of their members goes public, releasing their report.
[02:29:38.518 --> 02:29:39.119]  They fire him.
[02:29:39.139 --> 02:29:40.320]  That's Kevin Ryan.
[02:29:40.380 --> 02:29:40.860]  Stay there.
[02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:44.482]  We're going to come right back with architect and engineer Richard Gage.
[02:29:45.563 --> 02:29:47.264]  Just powerful information.
[02:29:47.304 --> 02:29:47.745]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.667 --> 02:29:52.568]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.048 --> 02:29:54.649]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.570 --> 02:29:58.272]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.084 --> 02:30:05.088]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:30:05.328 --> 02:30:07.110]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:07.330 --> 02:30:15.618]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:15.859 --> 02:30:21.084]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:21.404 --> 02:30:23.046]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:23.266 --> 02:30:29.610]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:30:29.770 --> 02:30:40.538]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[02:30:40.838 --> 02:30:41.338]  That's right.
[02:30:41.598 --> 02:30:43.900]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[02:33:00.171 --> 02:33:05.434]  I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride.
[02:33:14.197 --> 02:33:21.798]  Okay, Richard Gage, Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth's Founder.
[02:33:44.514 --> 02:33:46.534]  We got broken up by a couple of breaks there.
[02:33:47.095 --> 02:34:06.759]  Recap what happened with the production company with the television piece that just aired last week on the National Geographic Channel and then conclude in summary exactly what you're saying here and then I have the question to ask after you're done.
[02:34:06.779 --> 02:34:10.180]  Okay, so we have
[02:34:10.857 --> 02:34:11.758]  I think so.
[02:34:30.039 --> 02:34:43.648]  NIST, of course, in turn, threw that test out and claims a 42-inch sag, by the way, to justify their column failure theory, which they needed in order to get Larry Silverstein his $5.68 billion.
[02:34:45.990 --> 02:35:03.846]  But the point is that instead of doing something scientific like this, we have National Geographic, Robert Erickson of Creative Differences, hiring Emertek, a defense contractor, to show everybody, theoretically, how this building
[02:35:06.989 --> 02:35:07.309]  I'm good.
[02:35:26.266 --> 02:35:29.448]  90% of that jet fuel was expelled and exploded outside the building.
[02:35:29.468 --> 02:35:32.329]  The rest burned up, according to the official story, in just 10 minutes.
[02:35:32.730 --> 02:35:36.091]  So all the jet fuel did was ignite a normal office fire.
[02:35:36.471 --> 02:35:39.613]  Those temperatures don't get to be above 1,200 or 1,400 degrees.
[02:35:40.173 --> 02:35:47.297]  And even then, there's no evidence for temperatures over 500 or 600 degrees in the towers.
[02:35:47.941 --> 02:35:51.162]  So, this whole thing from start to finish is just ludicrous.
[02:35:51.222 --> 02:36:04.388]  And this, by the way, this I-beam is not interconnected with several other beams like in a normal office building where the heat is conducted away from the heat source throughout the columns and beams in the building.
[02:36:04.808 --> 02:36:15.152]  Which is really the reason why we never have had a steel frame high-rise building collapse due to fire because of this incredible conduction ability and interconnectedness.
[02:36:15.212 --> 02:36:16.233]  It's a huge heat sink.
[02:36:18.459 --> 02:36:35.011]  This experiment and the other ones were set up to fail and manipulate the American people into thinking that this is science versus, obviously, these architects and engineers who are simply conspiracy theorists.
[02:36:35.819 --> 02:36:46.345]  But last night at the Commonwealth Club, we carefully laid out all this evidence and he said, okay, at the end, which side is conspiracy and which side is science?
[02:36:46.405 --> 02:36:47.486]  So we have a show of hands.
[02:36:47.946 --> 02:36:48.426]  Guess what?
[02:36:49.727 --> 02:37:02.534]  90% of the 60 people who were either believers of the official theory beforehand or who were unsure, 90% of those 60 people were convinced of the evidence for explosive control.
[02:37:02.594 --> 02:37:04.516]  Okay, to be clear, you've got 200 people,
[02:37:05.777 --> 02:37:09.861]  At this meeting, I guess you asked before who believes the official story, who doesn't.
[02:37:09.881 --> 02:37:11.542]  You're saying that's how you know it was 60 people?
[02:37:11.562 --> 02:37:12.363]  That's right.
[02:37:12.823 --> 02:37:21.190]  Okay, so they raise their hands, 60 saying, I believe the official story that 19 guys coordinated from caves in Afghanistan did this.
[02:37:21.631 --> 02:37:22.391]  Okay, great.
[02:37:23.612 --> 02:37:30.278]  And then at the end of it, you're saying 90% of those 60 people now believe the engineering, now believe your information.
[02:37:31.027 --> 02:37:44.457]  Yes, and the numbers are 20 and 40, so that there's 20 people believing the official story before, 40 who were unsure, but 90% of those totaling 60 believed in the explosive control demolition theory afterward.
[02:37:44.497 --> 02:37:46.599]  And it's like that at every presentation, Alex.
[02:37:46.619 --> 02:37:52.664]  90% And you give most of these presentations, correct me if I'm wrong, to architects and engineer groups.
[02:37:53.502 --> 02:37:55.205]  Well, I, I, not mostly.
[02:37:55.405 --> 02:38:00.192]  No, we do visit local architecture and engineering groups, and generally... Well, that's what I meant.
[02:38:00.213 --> 02:38:04.820]  You said you've made a whole mission out of... I mean, how many architects and engineer groups have you talked to?
[02:38:06.257 --> 02:38:08.239]  There's been about a dozen now.
[02:38:08.739 --> 02:38:11.041]  Okay, well, what happens when you go to those?
[02:38:11.601 --> 02:38:20.547]  Oh, it's fascinating because you get people who, first of all, most of them know nothing about the third worst structural failure in modern history.
[02:38:20.587 --> 02:38:28.693]  Building 7, 47-story skyscraper collapses to its own footprint in six and a half seconds and their jaws drop.
[02:38:29.033 --> 02:38:37.001]  And by the way, NIST had always said freefall didn't happen, but then they were forced now to go ahead and say, okay, there was freefall involved.
[02:38:37.021 --> 02:38:44.149]  And they've given five, six different stories and had to recant their previous reasons that Building 7 collapsed in their own NIST reports.
[02:38:44.169 --> 02:38:45.030]  I'd like you to speak to that.
[02:38:45.350 --> 02:38:51.757]  And even National Geographic on the eve of this newest hit piece said, oh, our last
[02:38:52.722 --> 02:39:04.750]  Reasons for the towers collapsing with pancake we were wrong about that, but now we've got a new idea So they're they're the one because they say in the piece their stories never changed the government stories never changed But in truth their story continually changes.
[02:39:05.250 --> 02:39:05.550]  Oh, yeah.
[02:39:05.931 --> 02:39:18.899]  Yeah, it's always changing in fact They wouldn't have changed if it weren't for members of a you know, I'm a truth David Chandler physicist and Stephen Jones calling them publicly on their on their press conference and
[02:39:19.259 --> 02:39:24.123]  Okay, I want to go back for a moment and we'll continue going over this, debunking them.
[02:39:49.002 --> 02:40:03.471]  The maker of the television show, who I've talked to on the phone, he's always trying to get me involved in these shows, there's several shows, a JFK and a 9-11, and I tell this production company, no, I know you're deceptive, you're known as the most manipulative out there, that this is your specialty, and the guy laughs.
[02:40:03.591 --> 02:40:04.472]  I'm your friend!
[02:40:04.552 --> 02:40:06.473]  No, I want to show your side!
[02:40:06.533 --> 02:40:12.477]  And the JFK thing comes out, and it's a total fraud, you know, the most skewed to the official story I've ever seen.
[02:40:13.428 --> 02:40:20.573]  And so that's why when I was warning you, I was saying, Richard, this is, you know, months ago, when you were doing the interviews, I said, this is not a friendly piece.
[02:40:20.613 --> 02:40:21.734]  You said, no, he's listening.
[02:40:21.794 --> 02:40:22.714]  He says it's going to be in there.
[02:40:22.735 --> 02:40:23.415]  He promises.
[02:40:23.995 --> 02:40:25.136]  Have you talked to him?
[02:40:25.757 --> 02:40:29.859]  Which you now say that, you know, that you clearly, that he lied to you.
[02:40:30.280 --> 02:40:33.082]  The question here is, are you going to put a public statement out on him?
[02:40:33.602 --> 02:40:35.383]  Are you going to, have you called him?
[02:40:35.443 --> 02:40:36.284]  Have you talked to him?
[02:40:38.661 --> 02:40:43.645]  Interestingly enough, he has sent us the transcript for both of these interviews.
[02:40:43.705 --> 02:40:51.211]  So, it's clear that we have the evidence that he had all of the evidence.
[02:40:51.651 --> 02:40:52.552]  You need to post that.
[02:40:52.612 --> 02:40:53.632]  You need to post that.
[02:40:53.652 --> 02:40:55.994]  I'd post the whole transcript.
[02:40:56.335 --> 02:40:57.235]  He'll claim you edited it.
[02:40:57.776 --> 02:41:02.479]  I would post that and then let everybody write about it to show he's going, oh, I promised this would be in there.
[02:41:02.880 --> 02:41:04.501]  Oh, I mean, just unbelievable.
[02:41:05.726 --> 02:41:06.266]  Oh, totally.
[02:41:06.466 --> 02:41:08.167]  And we will... When are you going to put that out then?
[02:41:09.207 --> 02:41:10.388]  We'll get it out within a week.
[02:41:10.768 --> 02:41:11.408]  Good, good.
[02:41:11.448 --> 02:41:15.570]  Well, I'm going to be in New York for the whole next week, by the way.
[02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:17.210]  We'll be at Ground Zero.
[02:41:17.550 --> 02:41:19.791]  Hopefully, you'll be there in the morning.
[02:41:19.811 --> 02:41:20.751]  Unfortunately, I can't.
[02:41:20.791 --> 02:41:24.893]  I've got a bunch of stuff I'm working on here with the Charlie Sheen developments.
[02:41:25.393 --> 02:41:25.673]  Yeah.
[02:41:25.933 --> 02:41:27.373]  Well, I'll take your place, Alex.
[02:41:27.473 --> 02:41:29.994]  I'll be out there talking to people.
[02:41:30.014 --> 02:41:30.994]  There'll be a lot of cameras.
[02:41:31.014 --> 02:41:31.314]  Good, good.
[02:41:31.334 --> 02:41:32.454]  You're a great leader in this fight.
[02:41:32.954 --> 02:41:43.556]  Yeah, no, I'm finishing my film, Fall of the Republic, in the next week and a half, and I am working on just absolutely piles of work, but I would love to be there with you.
[02:41:44.197 --> 02:41:49.017]  Ah, well, I'll be at the two conferences there, the We Demand Transparency conference at St.
[02:41:49.057 --> 02:41:51.198]  Mark's and the Bowery, the 11th and the 12th.
[02:41:52.899 --> 02:42:01.442]  And in Real Change Conference, the 11th and the 12th also, Luke Rutkowski's We Are Change group is having some great speakers as well.
[02:42:01.582 --> 02:42:14.886]  So, I encourage everybody to come out to New York who can and support us and support these incredible truthers who have given so much to wake up the American people.
[02:42:15.306 --> 02:42:15.826]  Well, they have.
[02:42:15.946 --> 02:42:17.546]  Now, run through some other bullet points.
[02:42:19.947 --> 02:42:28.790]  I mean, you were trying, we went to break, also getting into underwriting laboratories, has this internal report where in the underwriting they tested fire making the building fall.
[02:42:28.830 --> 02:42:31.892]  It had to be a special building, because FEMA and the command centers were there.
[02:42:31.932 --> 02:42:48.418]  They went in and even added more strength, this super building, CIA, Defense Intelligence, IRS, Army, FBI, I mean, the whole thing's a... the second biggest CIA compound outside Layla in the U.S., they admit, and then magically it falls in its own footprint
[02:42:49.113 --> 02:42:51.916]  You brought that information about underwriting laboratories to them, but they don't care.
[02:42:51.957 --> 02:43:01.728]  They went and got a steel of unknown strength, an alloy, put a big weight over it, with the white tips of the flame, the very hottest part, hitting on it long-wise.
[02:43:01.748 --> 02:43:03.370]  Uh, just amazing.
[02:43:04.201 --> 02:43:12.404]  Yeah, and obviously it's going to fail with 3,000 pound point load right in the center span of the beam.
[02:43:13.685 --> 02:43:15.365]  It's designed to fail.
[02:43:15.406 --> 02:43:16.466]  It's designed to show.
[02:43:16.486 --> 02:43:23.769]  So when it does fail, I can imagine half of the public watching goes, oh, that's what happened to the World Trade Center.
[02:43:23.869 --> 02:43:24.809]  I see it failing.
[02:43:25.209 --> 02:43:26.290]  It's like sheep, you know?
[02:43:26.710 --> 02:43:28.611]  But the fires had almost completely burned out.
[02:43:28.631 --> 02:43:36.674]  There were people in the holes waving for help seconds before they just shatter and the building just, you know, just it's it's it's unbelievable.
[02:43:37.214 --> 02:43:37.834]  Yeah, in the South Tower.
[02:43:37.854 --> 02:43:41.156]  It's like watching a volcano explode and saying there was no pressure underneath it.
[02:43:43.217 --> 02:43:48.999]  In the South Tower, the fires were going out after only 56 minutes.
[02:43:49.359 --> 02:43:51.720]  According to the fire department, according to the fire department.
[02:43:52.754 --> 02:43:57.776]  Yeah, well, uh, Orio Palmer had reached the 78th floor and he says there's two isolated pockets of fire.
[02:43:58.137 --> 02:43:59.417]  We can put it out with two lines.
[02:44:00.098 --> 02:44:16.185]  And, uh, ten minutes later, uh, the, the, the, the, uh, hundred first responders are witnessing and documenting in their oral recordings sounds of explosions and flashes of light at the onset of the collapses, like a belt wrapping all the way around the building.
[02:44:16.245 --> 02:44:18.226]  It was as if they had detonators!
[02:44:18.366 --> 02:44:19.747]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[02:44:20.603 --> 02:44:23.065]  Yeah, that's a quote from the fireman.
[02:44:23.706 --> 02:44:38.599]  And we have news reporters on the ground, 2,000 feet away from this, ducking from the incredible sounds of explosions, which we don't hear on any of the reports.
[02:44:39.359 --> 02:44:42.942]  They systematically take out the sounds of explosions.
[02:44:45.444 --> 02:44:55.730]  Well over a couple of hundred witnesses talking about these incredible explosions and then debris flying everywhere out of the sides of the Twin Towers.
[02:44:56.331 --> 02:45:01.133]  As I mentioned, 600 feet flying laterally at 50 to 70 miles an hour.
[02:45:03.584 --> 02:45:06.886]  And so, this is a gravitational collapse.
[02:45:06.926 --> 02:45:13.228]  We would expect to see 110 floors stacked up at the bottom of each of these buildings.
[02:45:13.328 --> 02:45:15.849]  Guess how many floors we see at the bottom?
[02:45:16.460 --> 02:45:16.660]  Continue.
[02:45:41.095 --> 02:45:53.502]  Well, so I explained very carefully to National Geographic what FEMA found and what FEMA documented in their Appendix C of their May of 2002 BPAT report.
[02:45:54.363 --> 02:45:54.783]  Steel.
[02:45:54.903 --> 02:45:55.824]  Two steel samples.
[02:45:55.964 --> 02:45:59.346]  By the way, the only two steel samples saved from Building 7.
[02:46:00.947 --> 02:46:09.752]  But these two steel samples, they document intergranular melting, rapid oxidation, sulfidation, and even evaporation of the ends of these beams.
[02:46:10.612 --> 02:46:12.734]  The firemen have never seen this before.
[02:46:13.134 --> 02:46:14.356]  So how did this happen?
[02:46:15.056 --> 02:46:24.965]  And so they conclude, FEMA, that their best hypothesis as to how this building came down has only a low probability of occurrence.
[02:46:25.406 --> 02:46:26.767]  Well, what was our hypothesis?
[02:46:27.147 --> 02:46:27.568]  Fire!
[02:46:28.328 --> 02:46:33.213]  And some damage from the beams of the World Trade Center North Tower when it went down earlier that morning.
[02:46:33.931 --> 02:46:39.152]  So what happens to this entire... Oh, further research investigation is necessary.
[02:46:39.693 --> 02:46:51.996]  But unfortunately, though, for those hoping to resolve the issue, all of that steel has been recycled to China, and FEMA had ordered the recycling of that steel.
[02:46:52.276 --> 02:47:00.338]  They've denied this, but those who do this research end up citing FEMA for giving these orders.
[02:47:01.316 --> 02:47:02.837]  So, they didn't save the steel.
[02:47:02.857 --> 02:47:07.998]  You always save the steel in any kind of a collapse, so you could thoroughly understand exactly what happened.
[02:47:08.458 --> 02:47:11.439]  Now, this takes over the investigation after May of 2002.
[02:47:12.340 --> 02:47:18.002]  What did they do with this appendix C, documenting the melting of steel?
[02:47:18.482 --> 02:47:19.362]  They throw it out.
[02:47:19.702 --> 02:47:28.565]  It is not in the final report at all, in World Trade Center 7, that came out in November of just last year, seven years later.
[02:47:29.125 --> 02:47:34.687]  So, they've basically, systematically destroyed even more evidence.
[02:47:35.728 --> 02:47:39.469]  They do not want us to know about molten metal or melting of steel.
[02:47:39.529 --> 02:47:44.812]  In fact, John Gross denies the pools of molten iron, as it turns out to be.
[02:47:44.832 --> 02:47:47.533]  Stephen Jones and others analyze it, turns out to be molten iron.
[02:47:47.613 --> 02:47:50.394]  And we have all the videos of the firefighters saying it was like a...
[02:47:51.354 --> 02:47:59.937]  Foundry with molten metal running everywhere we can play the clips, but they're cussing including fire captains But I mean it was just everywhere
[02:48:00.805 --> 02:48:00.985]  Yeah.
[02:48:01.305 --> 02:48:01.846]  Yeah, it was.
[02:48:01.946 --> 02:48:04.247]  And there's dozens and dozens of witnesses.
[02:48:04.347 --> 02:48:05.487]  There's photographs.
[02:48:05.607 --> 02:48:06.168]  There's videos.
[02:48:06.648 --> 02:48:10.450]  It's all in my film, Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:48:10.470 --> 02:48:12.231]  The people really need to get it on Infowars.com.
[02:48:12.251 --> 02:48:16.253]  It goes through the whole history of this and the modern events, and that's how you really wake somebody up.
[02:48:16.333 --> 02:48:18.174]  I understand you're an engineer, you're an architect.
[02:48:18.574 --> 02:48:20.035]  That's an important area of research.
[02:48:20.615 --> 02:48:23.836]  I try, and I was very impressed by Terror Storm.
[02:48:24.097 --> 02:48:24.837]  Very impressed.
[02:48:24.877 --> 02:48:28.259]  Well, my point is that, though, there's the other angle where we all see the science in it.
[02:48:28.279 --> 02:48:28.879]  Well, thank you, Richard.
[02:48:29.591 --> 02:48:37.915]  We go at the history of it, that they've done this over and over again, and that helps people get past not imagining that government would do this.
[02:48:37.975 --> 02:48:39.396]  Government isn't like the rest of people.
[02:48:39.436 --> 02:48:40.016]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:48:41.135 --> 02:48:45.237]  Yeah, it's disturbing because, you know, all of this evidence is clear.
[02:48:45.317 --> 02:48:51.100]  As I mentioned to 90% of the people I talk to, they end up agreeing with us and signing our petition.
[02:48:51.460 --> 02:48:53.161]  But they say, well, what do we do now?
[02:48:53.181 --> 02:48:57.022]  And I'm going, well, we're architecture engineers.
[02:48:57.083 --> 02:48:58.423]  We can carry you this far.
[02:48:58.483 --> 02:49:02.205]  We can give you the evidence that the media, the government, has not given you.
[02:49:02.705 --> 02:49:08.588]  You can see for yourself that this points to something other than some kind of Al-Qaeda attack.
[02:49:09.209 --> 02:49:22.708]  Uh, you have got to do the research, and TerrorStorm provides an excellent background as to how these things have been systematic, as you mentioned earlier, with governments inciting wars for profit and control.
[02:49:24.991 --> 02:49:27.914]  They want to know, well, you know, how do we talk to people?
[02:49:28.955 --> 02:49:32.599]  Because this is a psychological problem for every American.
[02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:34.160]  Well, it is.
[02:49:34.220 --> 02:49:35.562]  Richard, we're almost out of time.
[02:49:35.582 --> 02:49:36.883]  I want you to be able to finish that last point.
[02:49:36.923 --> 02:49:38.905]  But again, have you talked to the maker?
[02:49:38.925 --> 02:49:42.088]  You've got the transcript, but have you tried to call the guy and say, you lied to me?
[02:49:42.649 --> 02:49:43.790]  Or is he taking your phone calls?
[02:49:44.330 --> 02:49:46.392]  No, he'll talk to me.
[02:49:48.534 --> 02:49:49.836]  We've emailed a couple of times.
[02:49:49.916 --> 02:49:54.140]  I have not presented him with a major confrontation at all.
[02:49:54.520 --> 02:49:58.344]  I'm trying to put my ducks in a row, and now I'm packing up for New York.
[02:49:58.404 --> 02:49:59.445]  It's going to be very difficult.
[02:49:59.465 --> 02:50:00.827]  It's going to take a little bit of time.
[02:50:00.847 --> 02:50:01.187]  I understand.
[02:50:01.227 --> 02:50:05.111]  Next week you're going to get back, focus on it, have a plan, and then come out with it.
[02:50:05.131 --> 02:50:07.854]  Well, I think it's important to people when they Google the name of this company.
[02:50:08.574 --> 02:50:08.915]  No.
[02:50:09.515 --> 02:50:10.376]  Who they're dealing with.
[02:50:10.396 --> 02:50:11.457]  I mean, I did some research, Tom.
[02:50:11.477 --> 02:50:13.538]  I was like, no way am I talking to you guys.
[02:50:14.019 --> 02:50:15.680]  Because I've been around similar people.
[02:50:17.282 --> 02:50:19.804]  When I had the History Channel people here, I knew it was a hit piece.
[02:50:19.824 --> 02:50:22.085]  But when they were, they said, oh, this is fair and we like you.
[02:50:22.126 --> 02:50:23.787]  At the end, they just laughed at me in a parking lot.
[02:50:24.608 --> 02:50:26.629]  And I had the British crew say they were being fair.
[02:50:27.550 --> 02:50:33.575]  And at the end, we went to a Chinese food restaurant and they wrote on a fortune cookie as a joke.
[02:50:33.595 --> 02:50:34.416]  They said, here, open this one.
[02:50:34.436 --> 02:50:35.236]  It's yours at P.F.
[02:50:35.296 --> 02:50:35.617]  Chang's.
[02:50:35.697 --> 02:50:37.038]  And it said, you're dead.
[02:50:38.410 --> 02:50:40.672]  With another British crew, and then I said, is this a joke?
[02:50:40.712 --> 02:50:43.574]  And they said, whatever, we don't like you, and got up and left.
[02:50:44.054 --> 02:50:49.078]  I mean, it was just like, they wanted me at the end to know, look, we punked you, we're nasty, we're black ops.
[02:50:50.139 --> 02:50:52.000]  And we love the New World Order.
[02:50:52.020 --> 02:50:53.221]  It's just basically what it was.
[02:50:53.281 --> 02:50:53.801]  Richard, stay there.
[02:50:53.821 --> 02:50:54.942]  I want to say bye to you on the other side.
[02:50:55.282 --> 02:50:56.003]  Plenty of events coming up.
[02:50:56.023 --> 02:51:00.706]  I'm going to get into this world government news, and Professor Stephen Jones is coming up.
[02:51:00.746 --> 02:51:01.447]  So much has happened.
[02:51:02.423 --> 02:51:07.284]  When it comes to emergency preparedness, you know it's the responsible thing to do for you and your family.
[02:51:07.825 --> 02:51:12.526]  You also know that preparedness, though a necessity, can cost hundreds, even thousands of dollars.
[02:51:12.946 --> 02:51:17.667]  Unfortunately, in these tough economic times, most cannot get ready for emergency situations.
[02:51:18.148 --> 02:51:20.708]  For many, preparedness has been placed on the back burner.
[02:51:21.128 --> 02:51:22.749]  This year has been tough for everyone.
[02:51:23.209 --> 02:51:26.170]  But that doesn't mean you shouldn't have any less of a chance in a crisis.
[02:51:26.750 --> 02:51:29.915]  That's why Ready Reserve is offering wholesale pricing to the public.
[02:51:30.296 --> 02:51:35.784]  When you're ready, give us a call, and we'll work with your budget and family size to help you grow your preparedness needs.
[02:51:36.245 --> 02:51:37.747]  The worst thing you can do is nothing.
[02:51:40.111 --> 02:51:40.411]  I think so.
[02:52:04.375 --> 02:52:09.804]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:52:10.205 --> 02:52:17.758]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:52:18.527 --> 02:52:25.589]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:52:25.970 --> 02:52:37.373]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:37.713 --> 02:52:41.235]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:41.675 --> 02:52:43.575]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:43.936 --> 02:52:47.797]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:54:10.582 --> 02:54:10.882]  U.S.
[02:54:10.942 --> 02:54:15.304]  News and World Report has the meanest hit piece I've seen by Peter Roth.
[02:54:15.364 --> 02:54:16.445]  I'm gonna try to get him on.
[02:54:18.026 --> 02:54:19.806]  We have the former German defense minister.
[02:54:19.846 --> 02:54:21.887]  We have one of the top people in the Japanese government.
[02:54:21.907 --> 02:54:22.868]  What is he, number two or three?
[02:54:25.169 --> 02:54:37.555]  We have all these scientists, all these engineers, all these physicists, all these military people, all these firefighters and police, the majority of the victims' family groups.
[02:54:37.575 --> 02:54:38.315]  We've had them on the show.
[02:54:39.139 --> 02:54:43.121]  The heads of the group saying the majority of our members at least half or more believe it's an inside job.
[02:54:43.141 --> 02:54:43.841]  That was three years ago.
[02:54:44.181 --> 02:54:47.882]  We have a New York Times poll, 94% believe the government's lying about 9-11.
[02:54:48.363 --> 02:54:53.605]  Charlie Sheen three years ago on CNN, 83% in their poll agreed that there was a cover-up.
[02:54:54.365 --> 02:54:55.265]  We're the majority!
[02:54:55.646 --> 02:54:59.687]  And you have this tiny cabal trying to make us feel like we're bad, we're stupid, we're evil.
[02:55:01.428 --> 02:55:06.090]  And when Charlie had this idea for 20 minutes with the President, I had no idea how big it was going to get this quick.
[02:55:06.130 --> 02:55:06.850]  I mean, it's just...
[02:55:07.972 --> 02:55:09.033]  It's just off the charts.
[02:55:09.133 --> 02:55:15.259]  I mean, we're talking 24 hours into this and it is just everywhere.
[02:55:16.820 --> 02:55:19.583]  And Charlie, again, is focused.
[02:55:19.603 --> 02:55:21.885]  He has to, you know, contractual agreements.
[02:55:21.925 --> 02:55:24.127]  He wants to focus on his TV show.
[02:55:24.167 --> 02:55:27.010]  They do the rehearsal tonight, shoot it tomorrow, air it Monday.
[02:55:28.191 --> 02:55:28.832]  Two and a half men.
[02:55:30.009 --> 02:55:33.031]  But next week, he's taking time out on Friday to be here.
[02:55:33.571 --> 02:55:35.293]  And I've asked him, I said, go ahead and do TV now.
[02:55:35.313 --> 02:55:36.694]  But he wants to focus and try to do that.
[02:55:36.994 --> 02:55:39.195]  He may do some stuff on the set.
[02:55:39.215 --> 02:55:41.457]  He's not sure if he can duck away on TV.
[02:55:41.497 --> 02:55:42.297]  I've told him, go for it.
[02:55:43.578 --> 02:55:45.680]  National TV is in the works.
[02:55:46.700 --> 02:55:47.541]  And a lot of other stuff.
[02:55:47.761 --> 02:55:50.323]  And some other things behind the scenes that I don't even want to get into.
[02:55:51.023 --> 02:55:52.904]  I'll let Charlie talk about it on Friday if he wants to.
[02:55:52.924 --> 02:55:54.105]  But God, he's got a lot of courage.
[02:55:55.806 --> 02:55:56.587]  Man, this is real.
[02:55:56.607 --> 02:55:58.028]  I can't believe I'm going up against these people.
[02:55:59.042 --> 02:56:02.364]  But I mean, you can't back off when you know they're murderers and did this.
[02:56:02.745 --> 02:56:05.787]  Richard Gage, in closing, you're going to be in New York speaking twice.
[02:56:05.807 --> 02:56:08.949]  People can find out more at Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[02:56:08.989 --> 02:56:09.809]  What's the best website?
[02:56:10.450 --> 02:56:14.552]  Yeah, it's AE911Truth.org.
[02:56:15.053 --> 02:56:17.194]  Stands for Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[02:56:18.095 --> 02:56:20.216]  AE911Truth.org.
[02:56:20.316 --> 02:56:23.979]  And I think, by the way, Alex, National Geographic did us a favor.
[02:56:24.399 --> 02:56:26.981]  That hit face was so bad that even
[02:56:27.461 --> 02:56:36.446]  Thinking people will see the major, obvious attempt to slander the truth movement and actually look at us and find out what the heck's going on.
[02:56:36.546 --> 02:56:44.410]  And that weird woman's voice, that weird woman's voice going, truth is... Then when she talked about the other people, she had a normal tone.
[02:56:45.231 --> 02:56:47.352]  And it was like a snake voiced it or something.
[02:56:48.092 --> 02:56:49.873]  And it's just an absolute travesty.
[02:56:49.893 --> 02:56:51.094]  Do me a favor, I'm gonna let you go.
[02:56:51.474 --> 02:56:52.715]  Mr. Gage, we appreciate your time.
[02:56:53.355 --> 02:56:59.479]  Contact me in a week or so, when you're ready to release those transcripts of what really happened in the interviews, where he's promising he's going to put that out.
[02:56:59.839 --> 02:57:03.461]  I'd like to have you on the air to expose that, to just show the deception.
[02:57:03.722 --> 02:57:04.602]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:57:05.123 --> 02:57:05.783]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:57:05.903 --> 02:57:06.884]  I'll see you on the road.
[02:57:07.264 --> 02:57:08.845]  Alright, amazing individual, Richard Gage.
[02:57:08.865 --> 02:57:10.186]  We appreciate him coming on with us.
[02:57:10.206 --> 02:57:10.966]  A lot of courage.
[02:57:11.026 --> 02:57:13.047]  Been through a lot that he doesn't talk about.
[02:57:13.067 --> 02:57:13.928]  Ah, man.
[02:57:14.388 --> 02:57:14.568]  Hmm.
[02:57:16.229 --> 02:57:18.051]  I haven't really even thanked any of my sponsors today.
[02:57:18.071 --> 02:57:20.272]  We're coming up with Professor Stephen Jones at 8 After.
[02:57:21.141 --> 02:57:23.403]  I want to hit some World Bank news, World Government news.
[02:57:23.423 --> 02:57:25.484]  I mean, just look at this, McClatchy Newspapers.
[02:57:25.524 --> 02:57:27.966]  But I wanted to zoom in on that while I'm plugging this.
[02:57:27.986 --> 02:57:29.747]  I want to tell you about eFoodsDirect.
[02:57:29.827 --> 02:57:31.468]  This is the best storable foods company I've found.
[02:57:31.508 --> 02:57:33.289]  I bought from three or four other places samples.
[02:57:33.750 --> 02:57:38.173]  One big load had MSG in it, genetically modified, packaged in foreign countries.
[02:57:38.833 --> 02:57:42.736]  Well, that is not the case, ladies and gentlemen, with eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:57:42.896 --> 02:57:45.778]  And they're the biggest outfit out there and the longest continually operating.
[02:57:46.744 --> 02:57:51.207]  And so they give you the best deals, and they package their food every month.
[02:57:51.367 --> 02:57:53.169]  It wasn't made 10 years ago or 5 years ago.
[02:57:53.589 --> 02:58:07.900]  So, high quality, what I have in my storable foods area in my garage, lasts more than 10 years, and climate controlled, 10 years in your garage, your attic, efoodsdirect.com, efoodsdirect.com, the letter E, then foodsdirect.com, or 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, and all these crazy times.
[02:58:12.563 --> 02:58:17.567]  If we do turn into Argentina like the Associated Press has Top Economist saying we are, you're going to need to have storable food.
[02:58:18.027 --> 02:58:19.088]  I hope that's not the case.
[02:58:19.988 --> 02:58:20.729]  Maybe we can stop it.
[02:58:21.029 --> 02:58:22.530]  The point is, it's an insurance policy.
[02:58:22.630 --> 02:58:25.612]  eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:58:25.993 --> 02:58:32.938]  Don't forget also, I've been so busy I've been plugging the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com with all the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the ball caps.
[02:58:33.238 --> 02:58:34.399]  That funds our operation.
[02:58:34.439 --> 02:58:35.219]  We need your support.
[02:58:35.259 --> 02:58:40.903]  If you believe in what we're doing, make a purchase of the great information today at InfoWars.com or subscribe to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:58:43.516 --> 02:58:45.579]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.120 --> 02:58:49.285]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today!
[02:58:51.530 --> 02:58:56.473]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:59:21.750 --> 02:59:22.070]  We're good.
[02:59:54.378 --> 02:59:56.280]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.760 --> 02:59:59.682]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:03.446 --> 03:00:06.268]  The best of times, the worst of times.
[03:00:06.508 --> 03:00:07.809]  So much happening.
[03:00:08.029 --> 03:00:11.052]  For those that don't know, we have Charlie Sheen live on today with us.
[03:00:11.072 --> 03:00:14.495]  We also aired that 21-minute interview I did.
[03:00:20.267 --> 03:00:27.833]  A few weeks ago at his home, a video interview I did with him is going to be airing tomorrow and he'll be live with us on the air again Friday for 9-11.
[03:00:27.913 --> 03:00:37.740]  And he's going public for the 9-11 families who called for a new investigation, for the six 9-11 commission members of the ten that come out and said it's a fraud, a lie, a hoax.
[03:00:39.222 --> 03:00:41.844]  We're doing this because we want to get the truth out.
[03:00:41.864 --> 03:00:44.045]  I want our children to live in a free country and a free society.
[03:00:44.486 --> 03:00:46.307]  Hitler used staged terror to get control.
[03:00:46.407 --> 03:00:48.228]  Stalin and Lenin did it to expand control.
[03:00:48.649 --> 03:00:49.169]  Mao did it.
[03:00:49.189 --> 03:00:49.930]  The Tsars did it.
[03:00:51.534 --> 03:00:54.656]  So many other governments do it, and the criminals running our nation are doing it.
[03:00:55.636 --> 03:00:58.037]  And people need to face those facts and demand the truth.
[03:00:58.938 --> 03:01:04.480]  Professor Stephen Jones is going to be coming on in about 30-35 minutes, and I am going to hit all this World Bank, World Government news.
[03:01:04.500 --> 03:01:06.461]  Let me just hit on some of it now, but I want to be honest.
[03:01:06.481 --> 03:01:12.764]  I want to dig into my stack from yesterday that was taken off my table, which is good.
[03:01:12.784 --> 03:01:14.265]  The guys clean up my pigsty in here.
[03:01:14.305 --> 03:01:16.626]  It gets really messy, but I had a bunch of articles
[03:01:17.734 --> 03:01:18.574]  In my stack.
[03:01:18.934 --> 03:01:20.035]  Oh, here's yesterday's stack.
[03:01:20.695 --> 03:01:27.777]  Where they're openly announcing Argentine-style collapse for the United States.
[03:01:30.018 --> 03:01:33.059]  And where all of this is coming out.
[03:01:33.099 --> 03:01:40.282]  And so I'm going to go over that and when Professor Jones leaves us, I'm going to cover that in great detail.
[03:01:41.862 --> 03:01:43.683]  But, I mean, here's one from today.
[03:01:43.703 --> 03:01:47.024]  A year after financial crisis, a new world order emerges.
[03:01:48.027 --> 03:01:55.611]  And then here's another one, Obama to seal US-UN relationship, the first US president to be a president, and the head of the International Security Council.
[03:01:56.632 --> 03:02:04.216]  And he's also the head of the National Security Council here that runs the FEMA camps, Homeland Security, the 400,000 troops the Army openly says they're going to put on the streets of America.
[03:02:04.736 --> 03:02:06.537]  They're doing acclimation drills everywhere.
[03:02:07.429 --> 03:02:10.811]  Running checkpoints for PR things that they think the public will buy.
[03:02:10.871 --> 03:02:13.792]  Helping people at car wrecks with the jaws of life.
[03:02:14.612 --> 03:02:16.413]  Searching people for alcohol and drugs.
[03:02:16.733 --> 03:02:17.453]  Totally illegal!
[03:02:17.533 --> 03:02:19.454]  Regular Army, regular Marines, confirmed.
[03:02:21.115 --> 03:02:24.597]  I mean, the establishment really wants to take over so they can loot and rob the country.
[03:02:24.617 --> 03:02:26.898]  It's like when a bank robber comes in, says, hands up.
[03:02:27.278 --> 03:02:28.898]  Tells the security guard, drop your gun.
[03:02:28.938 --> 03:02:29.619]  Put your hands up.
[03:02:29.639 --> 03:02:30.919]  I mean, they want our guns.
[03:02:30.939 --> 03:02:31.760]  They're saying, hands up.
[03:02:31.780 --> 03:02:32.920]  They've introduced the bills to do it.
[03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:34.661]  They're saying, hands up with the Army.
[03:02:35.382 --> 03:02:38.323]  The good news is the Army's full of a lot of good, awake people.
[03:02:39.563 --> 03:02:40.163]  In many respects.
[03:02:40.183 --> 03:02:42.623]  Though they're hiring a lot of illegal aliens and foreigners and criminals.
[03:02:43.204 --> 03:02:44.384]  Now, that's pretty scary.
[03:02:44.864 --> 03:02:48.285]  It's kind of like what the government did shipping in the drugs in the 70s and 80s in Miami.
[03:02:48.305 --> 03:02:53.065]  I was watching a documentary, Cocaine Cowboys, about that jogging on the treadmill this morning.
[03:02:54.386 --> 03:02:58.747]  And it had everything I already knew, but there it was in video with the police saying it and admitting it.
[03:03:03.303 --> 03:03:05.785]  Because of the crime wave, they then got rid of all the rules.
[03:03:05.845 --> 03:03:08.606]  Police could be drug users and be on the force.
[03:03:08.646 --> 03:03:14.650]  And police, then it turned out, it said a whole new, the entire new class got killed or went to prison.
[03:03:15.410 --> 03:03:23.095]  The program shows cops saying the entire new class, I think I said of like 1980, 81, I forget, in the film, all died or went to prison.
[03:03:23.755 --> 03:03:24.956]  They were all dealing drugs.
[03:03:25.016 --> 03:03:28.078]  Of course, I mean, it's a $500 million a year industry in the U.S.
[03:03:28.138 --> 03:03:28.398]  alone.
[03:03:29.651 --> 03:03:37.593]  And you can launder that money, so it has that multiple value of the fact that they can launder it and the banks can loan out 10 times for every dollar they've got.
[03:03:38.494 --> 03:03:43.875]  And then the BBC just calmly admits the US is guarding their poppy fields, but so the Taliban doesn't get it.
[03:03:44.796 --> 03:03:51.398]  And then you see opium production go up 10, 11, 12-fold last time I checked from the liberation of Afghanistan.
[03:03:51.838 --> 03:03:55.759]  It's about controlling opium, which is another 500 billion globally.
[03:03:56.539 --> 03:03:59.602]  Produces over 80% of the world's opium that's turned into heroin.
[03:04:00.843 --> 03:04:02.544]  So it's just pouring out of there.
[03:04:03.785 --> 03:04:06.407]  And... Then I hear local police.
[03:04:06.687 --> 03:04:10.390]  One local cop's got a radio show and... He's a nice guy, I've met him.
[03:04:10.711 --> 03:04:13.673]  But he gets on air and says, I just can't believe that officers would deal drugs!
[03:04:14.174 --> 03:04:15.735]  I can't believe the government would deal drugs!
[03:04:15.755 --> 03:04:16.676]  What are you talking about?
[03:04:16.776 --> 03:04:17.376]  Serpico!
[03:04:17.496 --> 03:04:17.817]  All of it!
[03:04:17.957 --> 03:04:18.497]  LAPD!
[03:04:18.517 --> 03:04:21.600]  I mean, how many times have the police...
[03:04:22.543 --> 03:04:26.930]  And the government, the CIA, how many times have CIA aircraft crashed full of cocaine and heroin?
[03:04:26.950 --> 03:04:30.535]  And then they put people in jail if they get caught using it.
[03:04:30.555 --> 03:04:31.637]  I mean, it's a sick joke.
[03:04:32.178 --> 03:04:34.341]  We have to admit the government ships in the drugs.
[03:04:34.821 --> 03:04:36.444]  We have to admit they're staging the terror.
[03:04:36.804 --> 03:04:38.367]  So they can then set up the police state.
[03:04:38.891 --> 03:04:40.752]  Then they got the military involved in the war on drugs.
[03:04:40.772 --> 03:04:42.434]  Now they're going to use the military on the American people.
[03:04:42.974 --> 03:04:44.795]  They got the military involved in fighting Al-Qaeda.
[03:04:44.836 --> 03:04:49.859]  Now they say, oh, Homeland Security document that we broke says we're going to use the Army against you.
[03:04:50.120 --> 03:04:55.844]  And then we get sent secret documents and they break in mainstream news where the Army's watching me, Ron Paul, and others.
[03:04:55.904 --> 03:04:57.665]  I mean, the Army is watching me?
[03:04:58.246 --> 03:04:58.806]  What for?
[03:04:59.707 --> 03:05:01.108]  I'm calling for peaceful liberation.
[03:05:01.892 --> 03:05:04.494]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.894 --> 03:05:09.857]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:10.217 --> 03:05:11.958]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.278 --> 03:05:17.101]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.281 --> 03:05:18.182]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.442 --> 03:05:19.203]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.583 --> 03:05:21.164]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.464 --> 03:05:22.285]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.525 --> 03:05:24.607]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.727 --> 03:05:25.848]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:26.068 --> 03:05:27.409]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.609 --> 03:05:32.673]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.873 --> 03:05:36.056]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.456 --> 03:05:39.919]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.259 --> 03:05:41.259]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.480 --> 03:05:42.100]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.400 --> 03:05:43.300]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.500 --> 03:05:44.241]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.441 --> 03:05:45.281]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.521 --> 03:05:48.282]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.582 --> 03:05:50.323]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.343 --> 03:05:51.263]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.868 --> 03:06:06.055]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:06.195 --> 03:06:10.541]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:10.721 --> 03:06:12.564]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:13.004 --> 03:06:14.346]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.626 --> 03:06:15.648]  There is a solution.
[03:06:15.868 --> 03:06:23.894]  InterHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:06:24.294 --> 03:06:31.380]  Try their InterFood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[03:06:31.760 --> 03:06:37.424]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health major.
[03:06:37.805 --> 03:06:43.389]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[03:06:43.809 --> 03:06:47.614]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[03:06:47.955 --> 03:06:54.183]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.
[03:06:54.203 --> 03:06:54.643]  866-762-9238.

[03:07:01.340 --> 03:07:05.642]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[03:07:05.862 --> 03:07:08.283]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[03:07:08.423 --> 03:07:09.183]  He was devastated.
[03:07:09.303 --> 03:07:17.967]  But it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[03:07:18.107 --> 03:07:23.989]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[03:07:24.309 --> 03:07:26.810]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[03:07:27.011 --> 03:07:29.372]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[03:07:30.532 --> 03:07:36.736]  And he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[03:07:37.116 --> 03:07:47.523]  MZ wants to tell you about a low cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[03:07:47.683 --> 03:07:51.646]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[03:07:51.706 --> 03:07:54.468]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[03:07:54.688 --> 03:07:58.309]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[03:07:58.469 --> 03:08:01.010]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[03:08:03.311 --> 03:08:08.912]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:32.896 --> 03:08:37.517]  We've got Professor Stephen Jones coming up here in just a moment with us.
[03:08:37.537 --> 03:08:48.881]  I do want to tell you about one more of the sponsors that has made today's show possible, maybe several, tend to not get to these until the end of the show, and they're so incredibly important.
[03:08:49.281 --> 03:08:50.321]  One of them is a Kola Blue.
[03:08:51.482 --> 03:08:54.663]  This is just an amazingly high-quality atmospheric water generator.
[03:08:54.683 --> 03:08:55.683]  Well, they've got a whole line of them.
[03:08:55.703 --> 03:08:57.563]  They've got huge ones they sell to governments and militaries.
[03:08:57.603 --> 03:09:02.505]  They have a small one for the home, looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on top of it.
[03:09:03.180 --> 03:09:15.467]  It grabs water out of the air from panels in the back, puts it through seven filters, including reverse osmosis and carbon, and then has a UV anti-bacterial light in the stainless steel tank inside.
[03:09:16.308 --> 03:09:20.490]  The Ecolablue 28 machine will allow you to get off the grid.
[03:09:20.511 --> 03:09:21.691]  You can get solar panels.
[03:09:21.731 --> 03:09:25.093]  They sell a converter that goes with it that works just for their machine if you have solar.
[03:09:25.534 --> 03:09:27.094]  Very inexpensive to get that converter.
[03:09:27.715 --> 03:09:28.775]  Ecolablue.com.
[03:09:30.237 --> 03:09:46.229]  O-L-O-V-L-U-E dot com, acolablue.com, big banners up on infowars.com and prisonplotter.com, or give them a call at 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043, acolablue.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:09:47.529 --> 03:09:51.232]  The atmospheric water generator for your home or office.
[03:09:52.313 --> 03:09:57.797]  Going now to Professor Stephen Jones, who four years ago,
[03:09:58.709 --> 03:10:00.370]  Now, How Time Flies went public.
[03:10:01.131 --> 03:10:07.897]  Stephen Jones, a retired professor of physics, has published papers in Scientific American, Nature, and Physical Review Letters.
[03:10:07.937 --> 03:10:18.886]  His peer-reviewed papers on the collapse of the World Trade Center towers, all three of them, when only two were hit by airplanes, is being widely read and has been translated into Spanish, French, and Japanese.
[03:10:19.146 --> 03:10:24.651]  It's available at the journal of 911studies.com, along with 26 other scholarly letters regarding the events of 9-11-2001.
[03:10:26.678 --> 03:10:39.230]  His ongoing research includes experiments with thermites, along with electron microscope energy spectrographic analysis of dust and slag from the WTC.
[03:10:40.525 --> 03:10:42.265]  And we really appreciate him coming on.
[03:10:42.306 --> 03:10:49.187]  He's here today to debunk the debunkers who lied to Gage and said, oh, we're going to show you talking about this evidence.
[03:10:49.727 --> 03:10:51.708]  Showed him a rough cut and said, this will be in the show.
[03:10:51.948 --> 03:10:54.268]  They have transcripts of that now, proving it.
[03:10:54.649 --> 03:10:55.729]  They gave him the transcripts.
[03:10:56.009 --> 03:10:59.930]  This same group is known for doing hit pieces on, quote, conspiracy theorists.
[03:10:59.950 --> 03:11:00.710]  It's their specialty.
[03:11:01.090 --> 03:11:02.350]  Creative Differences is the name.
[03:11:02.370 --> 03:11:04.651]  And they also did this ridiculous thermite.
[03:11:04.671 --> 03:11:08.432]  I mean, I've seen thermite tests where they put a cup of it over on an engine block.
[03:11:08.951 --> 03:11:10.312]  And it melts right through in seconds.
[03:11:10.372 --> 03:11:17.375]  I've seen... But this thermite barely even sparked, but just for a few seconds, saying there were hundreds of pounds on it.
[03:11:17.975 --> 03:11:19.015]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:11:19.936 --> 03:11:25.278]  And then they acted like explosive thermite didn't exist, nano thermite, super thermite.
[03:11:25.298 --> 03:11:26.238]  I mean, this was crazy.
[03:11:26.598 --> 03:11:28.259]  When we have all the patents and the rest of it.
[03:11:28.539 --> 03:11:30.460]  So I wanted to get Professor Stephen Jones on with us.
[03:11:30.480 --> 03:11:31.520]  Professor, it's great to have you.
[03:11:32.041 --> 03:11:32.621]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:11:32.721 --> 03:11:34.922]  It's great to be with you again here today.
[03:11:36.414 --> 03:11:38.275]  Okay, briefly recap.
[03:11:38.455 --> 03:11:48.858]  Most people know who you are, but for those that don't, how you got into this and then let's get into Thermite, Thermate, the different samples, what it shows, how it fits with the NIST report, fits with the firefighter testimony.
[03:11:49.139 --> 03:11:49.859]  Break it down, sir.
[03:11:50.339 --> 03:11:51.599]  Okay, sure.
[03:11:52.660 --> 03:11:57.181]  Well, to begin, let me start with the Journal of 9-1-1 Studies that you mentioned.
[03:11:57.501 --> 03:12:00.342]  We now have over 100 papers and letters.
[03:12:01.183 --> 03:12:03.484]  So the list has grown dramatically.
[03:12:03.524 --> 03:12:04.584]  These are all peer-reviewed.
[03:12:05.553 --> 03:12:07.593]  And I encourage people to go there.
[03:12:07.613 --> 03:12:27.717]  Of course, we also have the papers that you mentioned in more established scientific journals, technical journals, civil engineering journals, and of course, the Open Chemical Physics Journal has our latest paper with Neil Herrod, Jeff Ferrer, myself, and a total of nine authors, I think.
[03:12:34.645 --> 03:12:36.685]  Let's see, my other phone was ringing, Alex, sorry.
[03:12:36.705 --> 03:12:37.766]  That's okay, sir, go ahead.
[03:12:38.866 --> 03:12:54.509]  So, yeah, it's been quite an adventure trying to explain to people the difference between nanothermite or superthermite, same thing there, compared to ordinary macrothermite.
[03:12:55.169 --> 03:12:59.630]  And I'll tell you, I explained that very carefully to the National Geographic people.
[03:13:00.570 --> 03:13:02.831]  And they did get some of that straight, but
[03:13:03.635 --> 03:13:14.979]  You just couldn't seem to bring it to admit that, you know, here's a form of thermite that's nano thermite that's distinctly different from ordinary thermite.
[03:13:15.059 --> 03:13:21.281]  And the nano thermite is explosive and be tailored to be a high explosive.
[03:13:21.982 --> 03:13:24.763]  And they just they just didn't do it.
[03:13:24.783 --> 03:13:29.364]  And then, of course, this test they did, you mentioned that, where they piled up ordinary thermite.
[03:13:29.384 --> 03:13:30.745]  They didn't even put sulfur in it.
[03:13:31.601 --> 03:13:36.904]  That would have been interesting if they'd done at least that, which I talked about in my first paper.
[03:13:36.924 --> 03:13:45.530]  And you and I talked about thermate, which is the sulfur added to thermite, at some length, explaining the difference.
[03:13:45.570 --> 03:13:54.696]  But of course, the sulfur observed in samples of World Trade Center steel, observed by the guys at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and published.
[03:13:56.197 --> 03:14:01.180]  That great mystery, the New York Times said, how did the sulfur get in the steel?
[03:14:04.123 --> 03:14:07.884]  Sorry, clearing my throat a little here, but yeah, so they didn't even add sulfur.
[03:14:08.324 --> 03:14:11.385]  And of course, they didn't test nanothermite at all.
[03:14:12.085 --> 03:14:23.247]  And they kept saying, I just was reviewing that this morning, the NatGeo program, and they kept saying, well, thermite is not explosive, will not explode.
[03:14:24.167 --> 03:14:31.589]  Well, excuse me, there is a form called nanothermite that will explode, and so, you know, they
[03:14:32.355 --> 03:14:35.317]  Totally obfuscated that important point.
[03:14:35.737 --> 03:14:37.799]  And, you know, I kept hammering that.
[03:14:38.179 --> 03:14:42.082]  They did quote me on that in the program briefly.
[03:14:43.103 --> 03:14:51.189]  But, of course, their test had nothing to do with what we're talking about in the nanothermite paper.
[03:14:51.789 --> 03:14:52.690]  Nothing whatsoever.
[03:14:52.710 --> 03:14:54.111]  No correlation at all.
[03:14:54.531 --> 03:15:01.416]  And I told them, I was really upset when I heard about that in March, that they're proposing this, well,
[03:15:01.789 --> 03:15:02.490]  Well, not supposedly.
[03:15:02.510 --> 03:15:04.991]  I've already done the experiment.
[03:15:05.592 --> 03:15:06.592]  I called it pathetic.
[03:15:06.672 --> 03:15:14.098]  I said, this in no way represents my views to stack up a bunch of ordinary thermite around a steel column.
[03:15:14.858 --> 03:15:16.640]  I never said anything like that.
[03:15:17.320 --> 03:15:22.544]  We're talking about nanothermite in this paper and thermate, which is sulfur added to thermite.
[03:15:23.284 --> 03:15:25.146]  It looks like that was also present.
[03:15:25.886 --> 03:15:29.769]  Good evidence for that was the sulfur in the World Trade Center steel sample.
[03:15:30.922 --> 03:15:37.163]  But to do it with ordinary thermite, and the way they did it, is just ludicrous.
[03:15:37.243 --> 03:15:39.944]  And of course, I told them, it's a straw man argument.
[03:15:40.024 --> 03:15:40.464]  It's not.
[03:15:41.144 --> 03:15:47.965]  It supposedly represents my views, but in no way comes close to what I have stated.
[03:15:49.245 --> 03:15:52.386]  Well, I want to get into the science with you, Professor, today.
[03:15:52.706 --> 03:16:00.007]  But first, did they hold out in a dishonest way to you in the way Richard Gage, who I think has the highest credibility,
[03:16:00.595 --> 03:16:11.697]  I mean, he doesn't like to get in fights, he doesn't like to be nasty, he puts up with a lot of crap, he's a genteel person, scholarly like yourself, but I mean, he said this was a complete lie, a complete deception, a complete fraud.
[03:16:12.517 --> 03:16:22.279]  Well, you know, I think that there are certainly some elements there that I would have to say that Nat Geo was disingenuous.
[03:16:23.219 --> 03:16:29.840]  I mean, I said, look, NIST just can't seem to admit that there is a form of
[03:16:30.489 --> 03:16:31.489]  We're good to go.
[03:16:42.950 --> 03:16:49.452]  Oh yeah, they say repeatedly, they don't even know if it exists, even though you have all the patents and NASA uses it, missile separation.
[03:16:50.012 --> 03:16:58.955]  I mean, it just so happens the Pentagon has a lot of, and their scientists just so happen to have those patents, and you've got a bunch of NIST experts that are the few in the world on it, but no big deal.
[03:16:59.436 --> 03:17:12.400]  And you know, there's data published, as we quoted in our nanothermite paper, we published from Livermore National Laboratory, for example, till it's done and gash and those
[03:17:13.138 --> 03:17:15.700]  I mean, you know, as you mentioned, the very ultra-fine iron and aluminum.
[03:17:15.800 --> 03:17:20.564]  This is not something that happens as the building falls down to get this complex mix of
[03:17:38.544 --> 03:17:40.025]  Ultra, ultra fine.
[03:17:40.285 --> 03:17:45.226]  This is very exotic, and from sample after sample after sample, you find the same signature.
[03:17:45.867 --> 03:17:46.987]  That's exactly right.
[03:17:47.507 --> 03:17:59.191]  And so, for them to obscure all that, particularly after my... Actually, I was just pleading with Robert Erickson to please get this straight.
[03:17:59.871 --> 03:18:02.732]  NIST can't seem to admit it, but surely you can.
[03:18:03.733 --> 03:18:07.394]  That there's a difference between incendiary thermite
[03:18:07.822 --> 03:18:08.042]  I don't
[03:18:24.477 --> 03:18:38.060]  Well, I know you don't get into the Pentagon, but firing missiles into fiberglass chicken coops, and I recognize that's what it looked like out of a farm supply, a fiberglass little thin thing and blowing it up with a pound of plastic explosive and saying a missile would have blown the whole Pentagon up.
[03:18:38.100 --> 03:18:42.061]  I mean, this was, this was just, I mean, I was watching this and I couldn't believe it.
[03:18:42.721 --> 03:18:45.701]  And they would go, the science, the truthers.
[03:18:46.582 --> 03:18:52.823]  And they would like, off the page, have it all crooked, the word truther, even on your name tags to make you look... Right.
[03:18:54.004 --> 03:18:58.130]  And they wouldn't have the camera shots as nice with you guys, but then with their experts they would.
[03:18:58.150 --> 03:19:01.556]  I mean, we had History Channel do this to us.
[03:19:02.978 --> 03:19:06.523]  They would do stuff like, I would give a speech to a stand-alone crowd of 600 people.
[03:19:07.847 --> 03:19:08.627]  Yeah.
[03:19:08.647 --> 03:19:08.968]  Uh-huh.
[03:19:08.988 --> 03:19:09.068]  Yeah.
[03:19:29.781 --> 03:19:30.742]  He's not popular.
[03:19:30.782 --> 03:19:32.143]  That's what psychology today did.
[03:19:32.183 --> 03:19:36.325]  They said Alex had no fri... You know, basically Alex says he had friends, but we couldn't prove it.
[03:19:36.626 --> 03:19:39.628]  Alex said he has a good family life, but he wouldn't let us talk to his family.
[03:19:40.268 --> 03:19:44.211]  You know, when I have a great family life and great friends and great high school.
[03:19:44.571 --> 03:19:45.652]  It's a little too wild.
[03:19:47.013 --> 03:19:48.173]  It was a little too fun.
[03:19:48.193 --> 03:19:50.175]  You know, but, uh...
[03:19:51.567 --> 03:19:56.890]  But I mean, again, it's meant to sell the idea that we're like these outcast coops when we are the majority.
[03:19:57.170 --> 03:19:58.411]  Professor Stephen Jones, stay with us.
[03:19:58.431 --> 03:19:59.852]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[03:20:01.653 --> 03:20:06.976]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[03:20:07.536 --> 03:20:12.159]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[03:20:12.659 --> 03:20:13.299]  That was then.
[03:20:13.880 --> 03:20:14.520]  This is now.
[03:20:15.181 --> 03:20:17.362]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[03:20:17.882 --> 03:20:23.527]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time audio and video.
[03:20:23.947 --> 03:20:32.774]  The DigiNet sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, on lawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings, proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[03:20:33.155 --> 03:20:35.917]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[03:20:36.617 --> 03:20:40.600]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[03:20:41.100 --> 03:20:42.121]  Video never lies.
[03:20:42.621 --> 03:20:43.762]  Watch Big Brother back.

[03:21:09.888 --> 03:21:11.509]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:21:11.609 --> 03:21:18.136]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state, it wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:21:27.777 --> 03:21:33.084]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:21:33.725 --> 03:21:35.047]  An inside job.
[03:21:36.434 --> 03:21:37.495]  How dare you?
[03:21:39.076 --> 03:21:43.939]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:21:43.959 --> 03:21:46.760]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:21:46.860 --> 03:21:53.284]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[03:23:02.051 --> 03:23:03.652]  Food security from eFoodsDirect.
[03:23:03.792 --> 03:23:06.114]  The most valuable protection your family can have.
[03:23:06.354 --> 03:23:07.575]  It's a scary world we live in.
[03:23:07.855 --> 03:23:11.958]  Schools closed, businesses shut down, and reports of death all from the swine flu.
[03:23:12.218 --> 03:23:15.500]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.
[03:23:15.900 --> 03:23:23.265]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper due to the nation's $12 trillion debt, which is why gold is now over $1,000 an ounce.
[03:23:23.705 --> 03:23:26.267]  According to the Atlanta Fed Chief, unemployment is actually 16%.
[03:23:27.688 --> 03:23:31.891]  And the solution for every one of these threats to your family is food security from eFoodsDirect.
[03:23:31.991 --> 03:23:32.871]  We're good to go!
[03:24:02.114 --> 03:24:05.997]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[03:24:06.317 --> 03:24:12.222]  Would you stand tall and strong if you saw the things that were wrong?
[03:24:12.262 --> 03:24:15.184]  Well, Professor Stephen E. Jones did.
[03:24:31.309 --> 03:24:36.692]  Kind of like Galileo saying that the earth orbited the sun, not the sun orbiting the earth.
[03:24:37.792 --> 03:24:39.273]  And the truth is coming out.
[03:24:39.293 --> 03:24:40.193]  The system is scared.
[03:24:40.233 --> 03:24:51.178]  Professor Jones, do you agree with me that, or give us your take on this, that we see all these new hit pieces coming out now because they understand 9-11 truth has just continued to grow and didn't go away.
[03:24:51.238 --> 03:24:53.839]  It wasn't just a political thing of bashing Bush.
[03:24:54.460 --> 03:24:57.101]  That staged terror is something that people really understand now.
[03:24:58.884 --> 03:25:00.826]  I do agree with you there, Alex.
[03:25:00.966 --> 03:25:05.730]  I think that we are making progress worldwide, not just the United States.
[03:25:05.971 --> 03:25:13.117]  I mean, Niels Herrod, Professor Herrod in Denmark, gets calls from all over.
[03:25:13.738 --> 03:25:18.242]  He told me that he's been in the media a great deal in Europe.
[03:25:18.523 --> 03:25:22.747]  So I know that in Europe, people are waking up, including Russia.
[03:25:23.370 --> 03:25:25.311]  Of course, and other countries.
[03:25:25.371 --> 03:25:36.396]  In this country, it seems like, you know, every September 11th, we're coming up again, two days, and we get this burst of interest, which is good.
[03:25:36.956 --> 03:25:44.860]  But like you say, then, like the Nat Geo program, we get this mocking, basically, calling us truthers.
[03:25:45.320 --> 03:25:51.062]  And look at these guys' psychology, you know, psychoanalyzing us, that we're so paranoid.
[03:25:51.122 --> 03:25:52.403]  I mean, that was the term they used.
[03:25:54.431 --> 03:25:55.992]  As if we can't do science.
[03:25:57.232 --> 03:26:05.657]  That's the beauty of science, as I've repeated, Alex, is that anyone, regardless of belief system, can get the same result.
[03:26:05.937 --> 03:26:17.263]  If anyone will take a dare here, look at the World Trade Center desk, you'll see these chips that are red on one side, gray on the other, very distinctive.
[03:26:17.896 --> 03:26:20.938]  Then do the test that we did, and you'll get the same result.
[03:26:21.259 --> 03:26:25.182]  Yeah, you're finding the nanothermite itself unignited.
[03:26:25.722 --> 03:26:36.010]  The one issue that had any credibility, the one shred watching the program several times that I thought had any basis, was this claim, well, your chain of custody.
[03:26:36.050 --> 03:26:41.594]  But you have FEMA coming in two days after, locking it down, saying federal crime to even take photos.
[03:26:42.035 --> 03:26:44.477]  They cut up the steel, ship it off.
[03:26:45.419 --> 03:26:50.122]  You and others were able to go to the different states and cities that have gotten it, you know, to build memorials with it.
[03:26:50.143 --> 03:26:53.405]  You were able to get it from people that owned homes or apartments nearby that were still wrecked.
[03:26:53.425 --> 03:26:53.625]  Right.
[03:26:53.645 --> 03:26:57.968]  I mean, speak to that, because you've got a bunch of different places you've gotten this.
[03:26:59.109 --> 03:26:59.649]  Absolutely.
[03:27:00.370 --> 03:27:04.353]  We've studied in detail six samples now, if I count correctly.
[03:27:04.433 --> 03:27:11.438]  Four are reported in the paper, but we've been looking at more samples, and they all have the same signature.
[03:27:12.157 --> 03:27:19.959]  of the red-gray material, these chips that still blow up, the red material side blows up after all these years.
[03:27:20.879 --> 03:27:29.380]  And let me say, in the paper we make an effort to spell out the chain of custody for those samples that we reported on in the paper.
[03:27:29.900 --> 03:27:37.622]  We pointed out the distinct chemical similarity, the chemical signatures being the same in all four samples.
[03:27:38.237 --> 03:27:43.019]  So really, this basis, maybe someone could, what could it be?
[03:27:43.039 --> 03:27:45.060]  They salted these samples?
[03:27:45.600 --> 03:27:53.203]  How could they reach these independent collectors and New York citizens who did save some of the deaths?
[03:27:53.263 --> 03:27:57.925]  And I've heard of others since, and I had a call this morning, another fellow had saved some deaths.
[03:27:57.945 --> 03:28:02.206]  So, you know, people were saving it as a souvenir, nothing else.
[03:28:03.667 --> 03:28:06.268]  And to suppose that they salted these,
[03:28:07.170 --> 03:28:07.410]  Yes.
[03:28:39.476 --> 03:28:46.179]  This is actually at a memorial at Clarkson College in New York State.
[03:28:46.979 --> 03:28:52.061]  Like I say, there are these samples around, and this one happens to be at Clarkson.
[03:28:53.242 --> 03:28:57.103]  I contacted an individual who lives nearby.
[03:28:57.123 --> 03:29:01.805]  She contacted the fellow that actually put the memorial together.
[03:29:03.426 --> 03:29:04.706]  He does welding.
[03:29:05.327 --> 03:29:06.367]  So he put that together.
[03:29:06.880 --> 03:29:19.269]  He collected for us, for her and then she sent it to us, a sample right off the steel of the actual primer paint that was still on the World Trade Center steel.
[03:29:21.070 --> 03:29:26.433]  So we tested this primer paint and it's not the same as these red chips, not at all.
[03:29:27.114 --> 03:29:31.777]  All of the primer paint samples show potassium, magnesium, and zinc.
[03:29:32.578 --> 03:29:34.199]  None of the
[03:29:34.975 --> 03:29:35.255]  Chips?
[03:29:35.355 --> 03:29:38.156]  When you... I'm talking about when you get a fresh surface for both.
[03:29:38.917 --> 03:29:39.157]  Right?
[03:29:39.517 --> 03:29:40.117]  Paint and chips.
[03:29:40.157 --> 03:29:41.138]  Look at the fresh surface.
[03:29:41.518 --> 03:29:42.478]  Professor, stay there.
[03:29:42.518 --> 03:29:43.279]  We gotta break.
[03:29:43.319 --> 03:29:49.081]  Come back and continue with that on the other side as we debunk the hit piece put out by National Geographic.
[03:29:49.441 --> 03:29:50.141]  Stay with us.
[03:29:51.902 --> 03:29:52.862]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.883 --> 03:29:54.903]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.824 --> 03:29:58.525]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.391 --> 03:30:05.392]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.632 --> 03:30:07.412]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.632 --> 03:30:15.914]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:16.154 --> 03:30:21.376]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.716 --> 03:30:23.336]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.576 --> 03:30:29.902]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:30.082 --> 03:30:40.852]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:41.132 --> 03:30:41.652]  That's right.
[03:30:41.913 --> 03:30:44.235]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[03:30:44.475 --> 03:30:46.076]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[03:30:47.998 --> 03:30:48.619]  We're good to go.
[03:31:01.897 --> 03:31:03.578]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[03:31:03.878 --> 03:31:07.320]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:31:07.501 --> 03:31:09.382]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:31:09.402 --> 03:31:12.724]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:31:13.044 --> 03:31:18.547]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[03:31:18.827 --> 03:31:22.770]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[03:33:27.655 --> 03:33:28.776]  That's all there is.
[03:33:30.377 --> 03:33:34.961]  CNN, just watching it during the break, is saying they may be getting the people off the plane.
[03:33:35.621 --> 03:33:34.961]  999!
[03:33:35.641 --> 03:33:36.782]  You knew something would happen.
[03:33:37.663 --> 03:33:38.764]  Can't wait till this day is over.
[03:33:38.784 --> 03:33:40.426]  The globals are obsessed with numerology.
[03:33:40.486 --> 03:33:41.847]  Flip 999 over.
[03:33:42.647 --> 03:33:43.208]  What do you get?
[03:33:43.228 --> 03:33:45.029]  Of course, we're coming up on 9-11.
[03:33:46.331 --> 03:33:47.752]  I don't believe in that stuff, but they sure do.
[03:33:49.201 --> 03:33:52.604]  We're going to recap all the huge new developments with the Charlie Sheen exclusive interviews here.
[03:33:52.644 --> 03:33:53.605]  He was live today.
[03:33:54.105 --> 03:33:55.746]  That's coming up in the first hour of the show.
[03:33:55.766 --> 03:33:58.749]  I didn't announce it right at first, but he popped in at the bottom of the hour.
[03:33:58.769 --> 03:34:03.292]  And we aired a, in its entirety, a never-before-heard interview I did with him a few weeks ago at his home.
[03:34:03.893 --> 03:34:07.115]  That 21-minute interview aired in the second hour.
[03:34:08.517 --> 03:34:17.704]  And so that is all coming up again at the retransmission points at InfoWars.com and on your local AM and FM stations, Global Shortwave, WWCR, and the satellite.
[03:34:19.232 --> 03:34:25.114]  Going back to Professor Steven Jones and the 10 minutes we have left with him, then I'm going to cover financial news and some other issues.
[03:34:25.534 --> 03:34:29.695]  Professor Jones, you were making a point about... Right.
[03:34:29.995 --> 03:34:32.816]  So you got the paint that was on the steel, not the same thing?
[03:34:33.456 --> 03:34:33.616]  Right.
[03:34:33.696 --> 03:34:35.036]  It's not at all the same.
[03:34:35.436 --> 03:34:39.658]  It's very distinct from the red-green chip material.
[03:34:40.238 --> 03:34:48.620]  Yeah, the paint, just to recap that, as we looked at it using the electron microscopy system,
[03:34:49.444 --> 03:34:52.646]  And, uh, x-ray dispersive spectroscopy.
[03:34:52.806 --> 03:34:53.527]  That's that term.
[03:34:54.847 --> 03:34:58.249]  And, uh, I tell people that will be on the quiz, you know.
[03:34:58.310 --> 03:35:03.333]  And, you know, I appreciate when people make an effort to understand some of the things that we're trying to do.
[03:35:03.373 --> 03:35:05.694]  We're probing with electron beams.
[03:35:06.414 --> 03:35:09.696]  We're looking at the, uh, material that's in the dust.
[03:35:09.756 --> 03:35:13.359]  We're finding this pyrotechnic or explosive material.
[03:35:13.779 --> 03:35:16.761]  You know, I think people understand that that is significant.
[03:35:16.801 --> 03:35:18.762]  It shouldn't be there in quantities like that.
[03:35:19.522 --> 03:35:29.646]  I mean, this is an office building, for heaven's sakes, and the one sample was collected within 20 minutes of the fall of the second tower, the North Tower.
[03:35:30.247 --> 03:35:33.348]  So this cannot be contaminated by cleanup operations.
[03:35:34.088 --> 03:35:38.910]  There were no cleanup operations 20 minutes after the second tower collapsed.
[03:35:39.710 --> 03:35:43.792]  This was a fellow, Frank D'Alessio, scooped that up, got that dust.
[03:35:44.593 --> 03:35:48.034]  We found an abundance of these red grape chips in that sample.
[03:35:48.524 --> 03:35:53.628]  And his friend, what's his name, Breidenbach, also testified.
[03:35:53.668 --> 03:35:55.289]  We have their testimony on tape.
[03:35:55.329 --> 03:36:04.156]  The chain of custody is clear, straight to me and Jeff Ferrer, Dr. Ferrer at BYU.
[03:36:04.196 --> 03:36:17.246]  So, again, when we compare the primer paint, this is from steel, in a monument at Clarkson College in New York State, compare that primer paint with these red grade chips, they are not the same at all.
[03:36:18.055 --> 03:36:21.236]  The primer paint always shows zinc in abundance.
[03:36:21.256 --> 03:36:22.297]  There's a reason for that.
[03:36:23.017 --> 03:36:26.158]  And always shows potassium, always shows magnesium.
[03:36:26.238 --> 03:36:28.239]  This is a fresh surface now.
[03:36:28.259 --> 03:36:33.601]  You break off a chunk and you look at the edge so that you're not talking about dust now.
[03:36:33.621 --> 03:36:40.223]  You're talking about what's in the actual material.
[03:36:40.263 --> 03:36:47.366]  So the paint shows those elements, zinc, potassium, magnesium, always, whereas the red
[03:36:48.104 --> 03:36:49.765]  What are the chips?
[03:36:50.266 --> 03:36:51.767]  Are you saying it's nanothermite?
[03:36:51.907 --> 03:36:53.208]  And you wouldn't put
[03:37:15.559 --> 03:37:16.600]  Accelerant.
[03:37:16.620 --> 03:37:20.603]  You wouldn't put something explosive as fireproofing on buildings.
[03:37:20.963 --> 03:37:21.844]  Absolutely.
[03:37:22.404 --> 03:37:23.485]  No, absolutely not.
[03:37:23.545 --> 03:37:25.106]  It's a very dangerous material.
[03:37:25.827 --> 03:37:29.189]  You wouldn't want to breathe it in either, Alex, I might say.
[03:37:29.670 --> 03:37:33.693]  It's another, like asbestos, it's one of those bad actors that was in the dust.
[03:37:33.833 --> 03:37:35.554]  The EPA told us it was safe.
[03:37:35.574 --> 03:37:39.197]  Of course, you know, as an example, the government lied to us.
[03:37:39.937 --> 03:37:43.480]  And in that case, the whistleblower, Nikki Tinsley,
[03:37:44.292 --> 03:37:50.637]  Was the EPA General Inspector and she blew the whistle on the EPA for lying to the people about the safety of the dust.
[03:37:50.677 --> 03:37:53.899]  And by the way, seven years ago they would call it a conspiracy theory.
[03:37:54.019 --> 03:37:56.301]  You said Tina Todd Whitman was covering up for Bush.
[03:37:56.861 --> 03:38:00.444]  Later it came out that one of her reports said the dust is dangerous in the first week.
[03:38:00.964 --> 03:38:02.686]  The White House said shut that down.
[03:38:02.986 --> 03:38:03.506]  That's right.
[03:38:03.747 --> 03:38:11.032]  And the EPA Inspector General Tinsley, she spelled that out and wrote that up in a report and it got into the press.
[03:38:11.784 --> 03:38:15.807]  I think it was in 2003 that that truth came out about what the EPA had done.
[03:38:16.267 --> 03:38:24.493]  So, you know, it's a clear example of where the government, high-level, White House, you'd say, has lied to us.
[03:38:25.554 --> 03:38:28.877]  And so now here we have, we're having to ferret this out.
[03:38:28.917 --> 03:38:34.921]  NIST refuses to look for explosive, or explosive residues in the World Trade Center dust.
[03:38:35.001 --> 03:38:35.862]  Well, we've done so.
[03:38:36.582 --> 03:38:38.964]  And we challenge them to do so, you know.
[03:38:39.952 --> 03:38:42.373]  But they have just adamantly refused.
[03:38:42.873 --> 03:38:47.634]  And their excuse is, well, if you look for something that isn't there, you won't find it.
[03:38:47.654 --> 03:38:48.794]  And I'm saying, excuse me?
[03:38:48.834 --> 03:38:52.275]  How do you know it's not there until you look?
[03:38:52.915 --> 03:38:54.355]  But it's just really remarkable.
[03:38:55.015 --> 03:39:07.258]  And if I may throw in another one, which of course was missed by the Nat Geo program, that is the freefall acceleration of World Trade Center 7 for over two seconds.
[03:39:07.338 --> 03:39:07.998]  And that's over 100 feet.
[03:39:09.753 --> 03:39:12.035]  It was measured by David Chandler.
[03:39:12.555 --> 03:39:20.802]  I looked at this too, but to David's credit, he plotted the data, you know, and showed this is essentially free fall.
[03:39:21.302 --> 03:39:23.324]  And then he and I both challenged NIST.
[03:39:23.544 --> 03:39:30.309]  Remember last August they had this forum where you could send in questions by email, which I did and he did.
[03:39:30.329 --> 03:39:36.094]  We both challenged them on their statements about the rate of fall of the World Trade Center 7.
[03:39:37.455 --> 03:39:38.876]  And sure enough, NIST
[03:39:39.520 --> 03:39:41.401]  This is a little bit to their credit.
[03:39:41.441 --> 03:39:43.102]  They came back and plotted the data.
[03:39:43.342 --> 03:39:44.042]  It agrees.
[03:39:44.183 --> 03:39:47.204]  It lines up with free fall acceleration.
[03:39:47.264 --> 03:39:50.886]  It lines up with what David Chandler and I were trying to say.
[03:39:51.987 --> 03:39:57.950]  And so they admitted that, but to their great discredit, they did not go back and say, well, this is really strange.
[03:39:57.970 --> 03:39:59.971]  That means there's nothing impeding the fall.
[03:40:00.131 --> 03:40:01.151]  That's what free fall means.
[03:40:01.171 --> 03:40:02.052]  There's nothing in the way.
[03:40:03.038 --> 03:40:05.820]  Yeah, you've got hundreds of thousands of tons of steel and concrete.
[03:40:05.860 --> 03:40:08.902]  These beams don't just give up and disappear.
[03:40:09.082 --> 03:40:12.124]  Their mass alone would slow the roof down, but nothing slowed it down.
[03:40:12.764 --> 03:40:15.466]  Now that takes explosives to move this material out of the way.
[03:40:16.466 --> 03:40:22.230]  It's a prime evidence for explosives, along with the red chips that we have found.
[03:40:22.830 --> 03:40:31.115]  But what NIST did, they swept that data, they showed that plot, but then they say, oh, this is consistent with our computer model, and that's the end of that.
[03:40:31.155 --> 03:40:32.616]  We're not going to discuss it anymore.
[03:40:33.866 --> 03:40:46.934]  And so, you know that the computer model, which they will not let us test, I mean, it just can't be, Alex, that having hundreds of thousands of tons of material in the way and you get free fall.
[03:40:47.494 --> 03:40:58.121]  Unless they took that out of the computer model, which actually you can do in a computer simulation, but you can't do that in real life unless you use explosives to move the material out of the way.
[03:40:58.961 --> 03:41:01.743]  But underwriting laboratories, in their own report,
[03:41:02.609 --> 03:41:06.190]  Said that they did fire testing for similar things and it didn't make anything collapse.
[03:41:06.410 --> 03:41:08.131]  And it didn't fail, did not fail, right?
[03:41:08.231 --> 03:41:09.672]  Kevin Ryan pointed that one out.
[03:41:10.632 --> 03:41:15.133]  And he lost his job over making that one public, as I recall that was the issue.
[03:41:15.974 --> 03:41:16.354]  That's right.
[03:41:16.374 --> 03:41:22.356]  You were persecuted, no doubt, and given out of your professorship, even though you were one of the top lights at that university.
[03:41:23.636 --> 03:41:25.837]  Huge developments and discoveries in your own right.
[03:41:26.377 --> 03:41:30.479]  But the truth is the truth and God loves you for what you've done and the American people do.
[03:41:31.485 --> 03:41:35.227]  I hear there's a film coming out soon with a lot of the material that you've presented in it.
[03:41:36.827 --> 03:41:38.048]  With material that I presented?
[03:41:38.948 --> 03:41:39.828]  Included in a bill?
[03:41:40.409 --> 03:41:41.389]  No, no, in a film.
[03:41:41.429 --> 03:41:41.829]  I'm sorry.
[03:41:41.849 --> 03:41:42.610]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[03:41:42.890 --> 03:41:43.270]  A film.
[03:41:43.310 --> 03:41:43.550]  Yes.
[03:41:43.850 --> 03:41:44.891]  Yeah.
[03:41:45.231 --> 03:41:47.512]  Dylan Avery and his guys are doing one.
[03:41:47.532 --> 03:41:48.672]  Is that the one you're talking about?
[03:41:49.212 --> 03:41:52.494]  Well, there's that one, but I've seen other stuff on the web.
[03:41:52.534 --> 03:41:55.815]  I guess a lot of people are just taking your material then and making films.
[03:41:55.835 --> 03:41:58.116]  That is very, very exciting, Professor.
[03:41:58.652 --> 03:42:02.620]  Yeah, and you know, again I have to emphasize it's not just me, Alex.
[03:42:03.081 --> 03:42:06.248]  I worked with Neil Tarrant and Dr. Ferrer.
[03:42:07.285 --> 03:42:12.490]  Kevin Ryan, Frank Leakey, Brad Larson, you know, Danny Farnsworth.
[03:42:12.530 --> 03:42:17.775]  These are a lot of serious engineers and physicists and scientists that have a lot to lose.
[03:42:18.356 --> 03:42:21.138]  And I remember you talking about the professor at BYU.
[03:42:21.379 --> 03:42:23.381]  He just said, well, I'll look at it.
[03:42:23.761 --> 03:42:25.303]  And then, of course, he found what you found.
[03:42:25.883 --> 03:42:27.705]  And we all wish this wasn't true.
[03:42:27.785 --> 03:42:29.206]  I wish this wasn't the case.
[03:42:29.447 --> 03:42:29.687]  Right.
[03:42:30.047 --> 03:42:40.093]  Uh, but I mean, I wish three years ago I had medical doctors on and they said, look, in the trials of Gardasil, human papillomavirus vaccine, it's killing girls and maiming and paralyzing them.
[03:42:40.433 --> 03:42:40.634]  Right.
[03:42:40.654 --> 03:42:51.100]  I went on air and talked about it and got made fun of by the media and then now it's all over the news everywhere I turn, uh, where the human papillomavirus shot is killing or maiming or paralyzing people.
[03:42:51.160 --> 03:42:53.842]  I mean, we're just, we're just trying to tell the truth here.
[03:42:53.882 --> 03:42:55.282]  It's not enjoyable, I'll tell you.
[03:42:55.783 --> 03:42:59.325]  I totally agree with you and it does, uh, there's a personal cost.
[03:42:59.989 --> 03:43:00.909]  As you and I both know.
[03:43:01.950 --> 03:43:05.972]  I wanted to ask you, Alex, if I can turn the tables just for a minute.
[03:43:06.692 --> 03:43:12.034]  I'm really curious what you're finding out about this vaccine for the swine flu.
[03:43:12.054 --> 03:43:17.417]  And I'm sorry if I changed the topic, but I just gotta ask you that question.
[03:43:17.577 --> 03:43:24.080]  Do you have any, I'm sure you have some strong feelings, but any advice on what we can do about what's coming down the pike?
[03:43:24.571 --> 03:43:35.020]  You know, there's so many pieces of political data, socioeconomic data, so many medical doctors and scientists and virologists I've interviewed and all the different perspectives.
[03:43:35.701 --> 03:43:41.847]  It's almost like I've over-analyzed it to the point of, we know it's a lie, we know it's a fraud.
[03:43:42.307 --> 03:43:48.713]  We knew in January they were gearing up for quarantines, mass graves, federalization, NORTHCOM to put 400,000 troops on the streets.
[03:43:50.737 --> 03:43:52.578]  And we saw all these movements in January.
[03:43:52.639 --> 03:44:00.204]  I went on air and said, I believe it's flu-related, because emergency managers in Chicago and in Indiana were telling me this, and in upstate New York.
[03:44:00.244 --> 03:44:02.506]  Then I got secret documents and published them.
[03:44:03.387 --> 03:44:05.128]  And we said, this isn't a drill.
[03:44:05.228 --> 03:44:09.291]  They're not using this just as a cover for federalization.
[03:44:10.692 --> 03:44:13.174]  The banks are financing this worldwide.
[03:44:13.234 --> 03:44:19.379]  It's kind of a way of, they want to worldwide shut everything down during the economic implosion they're engineering in the fall.
[03:44:20.037 --> 03:44:21.538]  That they're going to use this to clamp down.
[03:44:21.558 --> 03:44:22.759]  I said that in January.
[03:44:23.679 --> 03:44:25.280]  Then in April, the flu popped up.
[03:44:26.361 --> 03:44:27.381]  We said regular flu.
[03:44:28.022 --> 03:44:30.063]  Kills over 36,000 people every year.
[03:44:30.103 --> 03:44:32.144]  Why are they fear-mongering over a few deaths?
[03:44:32.184 --> 03:44:33.345]  Now it's over 500.
[03:44:34.505 --> 03:44:36.567]  Why did it come out in the wrong year?
[03:44:36.627 --> 03:44:37.367]  Wrong time of year.
[03:44:37.387 --> 03:44:38.168]  Wrong hemisphere.
[03:44:38.328 --> 03:44:38.708]  Why?
[03:44:38.728 --> 03:44:40.069]  I had a virologist on.
[03:44:40.109 --> 03:44:42.570]  It was in BBC News saying it's a manufactured flu.
[03:44:42.990 --> 03:44:43.991]  We can look at its pedigree.
[03:44:44.031 --> 03:44:45.212]  Intelligence came out of nowhere.
[03:44:45.252 --> 03:44:45.912]  It's been engineered.
[03:44:45.952 --> 03:44:47.413]  Part human, part bird, part pig.
[03:44:48.934 --> 03:44:49.054]  And...
[03:44:50.720 --> 03:44:57.464]  So the question is, is it just engineered hype to get federalization in place as a cover without a bunch of death and forced inoculations?
[03:44:58.064 --> 03:44:59.925]  Or is it a cover just to sell a bunch of vaccines?
[03:45:00.105 --> 03:45:01.146]  Or are they really planning?
[03:45:01.166 --> 03:45:02.987]  Do they know it's going to mutate into something more deadly?
[03:45:03.687 --> 03:45:09.670]  Vaccine trials in Europe have killed a bunch of people with different flu vaccines in the last year, namely bird flu.
[03:45:10.751 --> 03:45:14.373]  There's internal CDC reports that have come out admitting
[03:45:15.533 --> 03:45:20.435]  Uh, that this could cause that Gillian Bernays disorder and nerve degeneration and even death.
[03:45:20.815 --> 03:45:25.657]  That happened in 76 with the same type of swine flu that popped up at a military base after inoculations.
[03:45:26.797 --> 03:45:28.298]  But people don't seem to be buying this.
[03:45:28.378 --> 03:45:31.739]  Remember back in 2002, they tried the model state self-emergency powers act.
[03:45:32.019 --> 03:45:39.842]  Tried to order all first responders, nurses, doctors, police, firemen, 14 million total, the LA Times reported, to take these inoculations.
[03:45:41.304 --> 03:45:42.604]  And for smallpox.
[03:45:43.525 --> 03:45:46.707]  But then Tommy Thompson wouldn't even take it, so the whole thing fell apart.
[03:45:46.727 --> 03:45:53.132]  So they keep trying this, but usually when it's just a hype thing they're doing, they don't build up all these assets.
[03:45:54.052 --> 03:45:58.796]  And so, I think it's an ace in the hole for them to release something else if they want.
[03:45:58.836 --> 03:46:07.962]  I mean, we know it's staged, but at a certain point then, we know what they're saying is a lie, we know it's staged, but we don't know what their exact playbook is.
[03:46:09.166 --> 03:46:10.708]  Or exactly when.
[03:46:11.789 --> 03:46:17.714]  If I could interject, too, one thing I really appreciate about you, Alex, is your personal research.
[03:46:17.774 --> 03:46:22.437]  I'm sure you have a team, but you have these facts right at your fingertips.
[03:46:23.138 --> 03:46:26.541]  And I think it's great on a variety of subjects that correlate.
[03:46:27.302 --> 03:46:30.584]  And the second point, I really appreciate that about you and your program.
[03:46:30.925 --> 03:46:35.969]  The second thing I wanted to say was that I get asked, I was just asked the other day,
[03:46:36.639 --> 03:46:40.621]  Oh, you know, maybe 9-11 was an inside job.
[03:46:40.721 --> 03:46:44.222]  I mean, maybe his government knew about it or let it happen, you know.
[03:46:44.262 --> 03:46:46.103]  But what difference does it make, really?
[03:46:46.143 --> 03:46:47.163]  I mean, it's over with.
[03:46:47.243 --> 03:46:47.683]  It's past.
[03:46:47.723 --> 03:46:48.744]  It was eight years ago.
[03:46:49.204 --> 03:46:59.868]  And I said, look, these same people, the puppeteers there, if you get the big picture, it's not over.
[03:47:00.504 --> 03:47:17.081]  And the sooner we wake up, the sooner we can do something to change our republic, to have this renaissance that we need to clean up these guys, if we possibly can at this late date, and stop them.
[03:47:17.161 --> 03:47:20.305]  It's not going to stop just by burying our heads in the sand and saying,
[03:47:21.278 --> 03:47:21.759]  Exactly.
[03:47:21.779 --> 03:47:27.503]  I mean, every time I think about getting shut up, getting put in prison, getting killed, and I'm not trying to get sympathy here, folks.
[03:47:27.564 --> 03:47:34.609]  I mean, it's, it's, it's, I don't even tell you a tenth of the stuff that goes on behind the scenes, but I live in like a James Bond movie, but I'm not James Bond.
[03:47:34.629 --> 03:47:35.490]  I'm just an average guy.
[03:47:36.411 --> 03:47:43.477]  And, the, whenever it's overwhelming or I wake up at 3 a.m., like, not even fear, but more just gripped by the enormity
[03:47:44.258 --> 03:47:46.200]  I think about my children, but other people's children.
[03:47:46.240 --> 03:47:46.800]  And you're right.
[03:47:47.101 --> 03:47:50.443]  These sickos that did this are going to continue to stage events.
[03:47:50.464 --> 03:47:51.905]  They're going to continue to do wicked things.
[03:47:51.945 --> 03:47:53.426]  It wasn't George Bush that did this.
[03:47:53.466 --> 03:47:55.808]  It was the National Security Council.
[03:47:55.828 --> 03:47:57.710]  It was the private corporate takeover above them.
[03:47:58.440 --> 03:48:02.783]  The CFR wrote manuals how they needed big catalyzing terror events and Cheney did.
[03:48:02.803 --> 03:48:03.823]  Right.
[03:48:04.184 --> 03:48:05.144]  And I'm in this.
[03:48:05.184 --> 03:48:09.507]  When I got involved 13 and a half, 14 years ago, I had no idea how deep it was, how bad it was.
[03:48:09.907 --> 03:48:10.807]  I was naive.
[03:48:10.928 --> 03:48:12.689]  I was just standing up for the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[03:48:13.589 --> 03:48:16.131]  And now I realize I'm point of no return.
[03:48:16.291 --> 03:48:17.011]  I can't go back.
[03:48:17.211 --> 03:48:18.372]  Plus, none of us can go back.
[03:48:18.792 --> 03:48:22.975]  Even if people live in denial and say this isn't happening, you can't go back.
[03:48:23.035 --> 03:48:24.876]  You can't go back once you know the truth.
[03:48:27.173 --> 03:48:28.314]  Yeah, I felt the same way.
[03:48:28.794 --> 03:48:35.858]  When I learned about this, it was actually spring of 2005 when I first saw World Trade Center 7 coming down.
[03:48:35.878 --> 03:48:40.220]  And the way it came down, I pulled out my stopwatch, you know, and I was reading and analyzing.
[03:48:41.401 --> 03:48:44.863]  And, man, it just hit me like a ton of bricks.
[03:48:44.923 --> 03:48:49.685]  And then, you know, I'm reading this, what was the name, PNAC report that came out in
[03:48:51.710 --> 03:48:54.092]  Well, it came out just about a year ago.
[03:48:54.132 --> 03:48:57.034]  September 20th, 2000, rebuilding America's defenses.
[03:48:57.154 --> 03:48:57.455]  Right.
[03:48:57.815 --> 03:49:04.380]  So just one year before 9-11, 2001, and I think, man, these guys are talking about American empire.
[03:49:04.921 --> 03:49:06.782]  And they're not even, you know, hiding it.
[03:49:06.822 --> 03:49:12.407]  They want hegemony, domination, using United States military power.
[03:49:12.727 --> 03:49:17.311]  And they say we've got to have a Pearl Harbor style event to do it.
[03:49:17.611 --> 03:49:18.432]  Pearl Harbor killed 3,000.
[03:49:18.472 --> 03:49:19.352]  9-11 killed right at 3,000.
[03:49:19.433 --> 03:49:19.533]  Yeah.
[03:49:21.983 --> 03:49:30.985]  I mean, yeah, and so anyway, it hit me and, you know, a lot of my family now have awakened to this situation.
[03:49:31.325 --> 03:49:32.686]  Awful situation, really.
[03:49:32.726 --> 03:49:35.566]  But, you know, there are some things we feel that we are doing.
[03:49:36.126 --> 03:49:38.407]  It's not totally pessimistic, is it?
[03:49:38.807 --> 03:49:43.088]  People like you and I are speaking out and doing what we can.
[03:49:43.148 --> 03:49:47.009]  And then, you know, I always like to encourage people to get food storage.
[03:49:47.967 --> 03:49:50.629]  I'm sure glad I bought some gold and silver a few years ago.
[03:49:51.549 --> 03:49:52.970]  Gold just went over $1,000 an ounce.
[03:49:52.990 --> 03:49:54.551]  Do you see that?
[03:49:55.452 --> 03:49:55.952]  Yeah, I did.
[03:49:55.972 --> 03:49:57.093]  We told people to buy it when it was $300.
[03:49:58.093 --> 03:49:58.974]  But we're not perfect.
[03:49:59.014 --> 03:49:59.354]  We try.
[03:49:59.374 --> 03:50:00.355]  I mean, I buy gold.
[03:50:00.435 --> 03:50:01.115]  I've got guns.
[03:50:01.155 --> 03:50:01.775]  I've got food.
[03:50:02.136 --> 03:50:03.136]  I'm not looking for trouble.
[03:50:03.276 --> 03:50:12.422]  I just know that when you leave us in the final segment, I'm going to hit the news where top economists are in major news saying the dollar will probably die in the next two years.
[03:50:12.782 --> 03:50:14.363]  We will probably be like Argentina.
[03:50:14.583 --> 03:50:15.864]  I'm not the one saying that.
[03:50:16.494 --> 03:50:18.475]  But we knew years ago they were planning it.
[03:50:18.896 --> 03:50:25.120]  Professor, I'd like to have you back sometime just on your political beliefs and ideas, because I found this very refreshing discussing it with you.
[03:50:25.200 --> 03:50:27.261]  Fire out the websites for folks.
[03:50:28.162 --> 03:50:29.222]  Okay, websites.
[03:50:29.963 --> 03:50:34.906]  Let me start with journalof911studies.com.
[03:50:36.087 --> 03:50:42.371]  And that has over 100 peer-reviewed papers, and then plus it links to our three major papers in it.
[03:50:42.391 --> 03:50:43.211]  We're almost out of time.
[03:50:43.251 --> 03:50:43.892]  Fire out the other.
[03:50:44.812 --> 03:50:45.313]  Oh, boy.
[03:50:46.921 --> 03:50:51.806]  Gosh, uh, STJ911, AE911truth.org.
[03:50:52.486 --> 03:50:53.047]  Professor?
[03:50:53.207 --> 03:50:55.189]  Oh, one more thing, quick, Alex.
[03:50:55.209 --> 03:50:58.192]  We're starting up a scientist for 9-11 Truth.
[03:50:58.772 --> 03:51:00.894]  That should be out here next week, I hope.
[03:51:01.255 --> 03:51:01.575]  Awesome!
[03:51:01.675 --> 03:51:03.176]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[03:51:03.356 --> 03:51:04.798]  What does humidity mean to you?
[03:51:05.118 --> 03:51:07.340]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[03:51:07.801 --> 03:51:12.505]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[03:51:12.907 --> 03:51:15.748]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[03:51:16.108 --> 03:51:32.012]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[03:51:32.552 --> 03:51:34.573]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[03:51:34.873 --> 03:51:35.873]  I use one every day.
[03:51:36.293 --> 03:51:38.734]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[03:51:38.934 --> 03:51:39.494]  I think so.
[03:52:02.302 --> 03:52:07.626]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.346 --> 03:52:13.690]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.231 --> 03:52:20.395]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.715 --> 03:52:22.556]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.696 --> 03:52:25.078]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.158 --> 03:52:36.106]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:38.347 --> 03:52:39.608]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.028 --> 03:52:41.409]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.870 --> 03:52:48.114]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:52:57.047 --> 03:52:58.188]  The Obama Deception.

[03:53:01.696 --> 03:53:03.619]  As gardeners, we can all relate.

[03:54:22.961 --> 03:54:23.562]  We're good.
[03:54:49.440 --> 03:54:52.162]  All right, folks, this is Ted Anderson stepping in for Alex.
[03:54:52.202 --> 03:54:59.285]  He asked me to just come in and remind everybody that he will be live on Sunday from 4 o'clock to 6 o'clock.
[03:55:00.346 --> 03:55:03.708]  He also, you know, been watching the gold and silver market.
[03:55:03.748 --> 03:55:10.231]  And obviously, if he were here today, he would say, I want to have Ted Anderson up to talk about what's going on in the gold and silver market.
[03:55:10.292 --> 03:55:11.852]  It's such a hot item at this point.
[03:55:12.873 --> 03:55:13.573]  Gold today is at $1,008.
[03:55:13.613 --> 03:55:14.654]  Seen a high today of $1,018.
[03:55:20.106 --> 03:55:37.276]  And interestingly enough, last Monday I was on the air with Alex, and I was talking about how I thought that maybe very shortly I would be looking at a goal at $1,009 and figuring that that is going to be the bottom side of the market rather than the top side of the market.
[03:55:37.336 --> 03:55:45.361]  At that time, we were fluctuating between $9.00, about $9.95, seeing a market peak of about $1,008.
[03:55:47.006 --> 03:55:50.127]  So far we've hit $1,021 an ounce for gold.
[03:55:50.607 --> 03:55:58.710]  The market peak for the all-time high that it's ever been before was $1,030 about a year and a half ago.
[03:56:00.531 --> 03:56:08.513]  Now with what's going on in the marketplace today, today I mean I'm looking at the news and there's some positive signs of the economy.
[03:56:09.294 --> 03:56:10.134]  What does that mean?
[03:56:10.214 --> 03:56:12.755]  I mean do we have positive signs of the economy for real?
[03:56:13.907 --> 03:56:40.196]  One of the things that I can say indications that if the unemployment starts to go down What you're going to see is you're going to see a further deterioration in the world markets and the reason is this We created all this tarp funds 700 billion dollars and of course has turned into trillions of dollars now and The printing presses have been running full speed ahead in Washington DC and with all that that's going on the Chinese are very concerned about
[03:56:40.896 --> 03:56:58.008]  Obviously in other nations as well, but the Chinese are the big one Chinese are very concerned about the United States dollar and How well it'll hold value in the future now China has been selling us their goods and services Well, we all know that everything's made in China nowadays most of everything I should say
[03:56:59.068 --> 03:57:04.291]  And we've been shipping a lot of dollars over there, so they sit on about 3.3 trillion dollars of U.S.
[03:57:04.331 --> 03:57:09.934]  currency in the form of either paper notes itself, bank deposits, or U.S.
[03:57:09.974 --> 03:57:10.974]  government securities.
[03:57:13.175 --> 03:57:19.739]  Now China has been considering trying, you know, trying to lighten up their load and getting away from the U.S.
[03:57:19.779 --> 03:57:22.600]  dollar, and that's why you're seeing this U.N.
[03:57:23.101 --> 03:57:25.602]  coalition to form a basket of currencies, you know,
[03:57:26.671 --> 03:57:29.153]  Once that really happens, the United States is doomed.
[03:57:29.594 --> 03:57:43.045]  Because the only reason why the United States has been able to enjoy prosperity in the last 20, even 30 years, is because of the fact that we've been able to sell our debt to foreign countries.
[03:57:43.085 --> 03:57:43.886]  We all have heard that.
[03:57:44.427 --> 03:57:46.128]  We're selling our debt to foreign countries.
[03:57:46.168 --> 03:57:52.794]  We're able to take their earned money, inject it into our system, and keep our economy going in the form of a loan.
[03:57:52.914 --> 03:57:54.055]  Now we owe them all this money.
[03:57:54.887 --> 03:57:56.507]  And we have trouble.
[03:57:56.587 --> 03:57:58.628]  So what I do is call Midas at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:57:58.688 --> 03:58:04.949]  I have the Walking Liberty Halves.
[03:58:04.969 --> 03:58:07.070]  Alex asked me to hold those throughout the weekend.
[03:58:07.150 --> 03:58:07.610]  I'm gonna.
[03:58:08.190 --> 03:58:08.750]  They're still at $8.69.
[03:58:10.490 --> 03:58:11.951]  We have the Franks at $2.36.
[03:58:12.011 --> 03:58:14.451]  British Sovereigns at $2.91.
[03:58:16.312 --> 03:58:17.712]  Take and move your money into gold.
[03:58:17.732 --> 03:58:19.732]  That's all I can say at this particular time.
[03:58:19.792 --> 03:58:21.853]  If you're sitting there with cash,
[03:58:22.352 --> 03:58:23.612]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:23.632 --> 03:58:25.313]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:52.145 --> 03:58:57.129]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:58:57.349 --> 03:59:01.153]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:01.373 --> 03:59:06.978]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:07.278 --> 03:59:12.142]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:12.342 --> 03:59:12.843]  Number three,
[03:59:13.243 --> 03:59:18.685]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:59:19.545 --> 03:59:22.206]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[03:59:22.446 --> 03:59:25.847]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
