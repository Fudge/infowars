[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.681]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:09.024]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.428 --> 00:00:16.068]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.729 --> 00:00:17.789]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.611]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:21.092]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.832 --> 00:00:22.753]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.773 --> 00:00:27.056]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.596 --> 00:00:31.639]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:40.698]  Alright folks, we are live at PrisonPlanet.tv!
[00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:47.585]  And I am just honored to be sitting in for Alex Jones for a whole week.
[00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:50.937]  And he much deserved vacation.
[00:00:51.177 --> 00:00:53.479]  If you don't know who I am, I'm Jason Bermance.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.862]  I've produced a couple films out there, Loose Change being one of them.
[00:00:56.943 --> 00:01:02.408]  I wrote and directed Fabled Enemies, both readily available over at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.372]  And right now, we've got a guest on from Gun Owners of America.
[00:01:07.412 --> 00:01:09.834]  This guy was heavily involved in the Buchanan...
[00:01:11.087 --> 00:01:12.348]  campaign for the presidency.
[00:01:12.368 --> 00:01:18.111]  We played a Buchanan clip earlier today where we have Tom Blankley talking about how we need conscription.
[00:01:18.132 --> 00:01:18.652]  That was back in 2007.
[00:01:18.892 --> 00:01:24.596]  He just launched a book yesterday called Grits where Fox and Friends is praising the idea that we have a
[00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.532]  Mandatory military for all people 18 years old and above.
[00:01:29.552 --> 00:01:30.212]  I think it's 18 to 25.
[00:01:30.412 --> 00:01:32.233]  You've got to serve at least two years.
[00:01:32.273 --> 00:01:32.774]  How lovely.
[00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:36.956]  And we also had a caller earlier asking about a carry and conceal permit.
[00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:46.962]  You know, I know it varies from state to state, but in my state of New York, it's almost impossible to get a conceal and carry permit unless you're a, you know, former law officer or a former military officer.
[00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:49.003]  And even then, it's not guaranteed.
[00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:50.164]  So, welcome Larry.
[00:01:50.184 --> 00:01:50.744]  How are you today?
[00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:53.866]  We've got a fisher cut date real fast for the capital advance.
[00:01:55.016 --> 00:01:56.398]  Okay, maybe we don't have him on.
[00:01:56.418 --> 00:01:57.519]  We have somebody in the background there?
[00:01:59.021 --> 00:01:59.882]  Alright, we'll wait one moment.
[00:02:01.344 --> 00:02:01.804]  Let's see.
[00:02:02.986 --> 00:02:10.715]  Until we get him on, I want to talk one more time, I guess, about this Obama climate change czar who has socialist ties.
[00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:21.975]  Carol M. Browner, President-Elect Barack Obama's pick as Global Warming Czar, was listed as one of 14 leaders of the Socialist Group's Commission for a Sustainable World Society.
[00:02:22.035 --> 00:02:24.497]  That's the Commission for a Sustainable World Society.
[00:02:24.737 --> 00:02:31.001]  Whenever they're calling for a sustainable world society, and people like, you know, Gordon Brown are the heads of it.
[00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:32.721]  You know, we should play that clip.
[00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:33.341]  We got a couple minutes.
[00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:36.102]  Can we play that Gordon Brown New World Order speech again?
[00:02:36.642 --> 00:02:42.844]  You know, Gordon Brown is so pro-world government, it is mind-boggling to me.
[00:02:44.244 --> 00:02:49.986]  It's more than mind-boggling to me that people don't understand that the New World Order is real.
[00:02:50.046 --> 00:02:52.706]  It's on the cover of their newspapers there.
[00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:55.427]  And this is him before he's even elected.
[00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.774]  Um, you know, this is the guy that's the successor to Tony Blair.
[00:02:59.794 --> 00:03:04.862]  You don't see him in the press as much as you did with Tony, but we only saw Tony because we were in a war crisis.
[00:03:05.062 --> 00:03:05.784]  Let's go to that clip.
[00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:13.571]  about the biggest restructuring we have ever seen, not just of the global economy, but of the global order as a whole.
[00:03:14.371 --> 00:03:22.653]  And 200 years ago, a famous British Foreign Secretary said that the new world had been called into existence to redress the balance of the old.
[00:03:23.513 --> 00:03:30.795]  In 1990, another old world ended, dominated by the Cold War, and people talked then, in 1990, of a new world order.
[00:03:32.941 --> 00:03:35.424]  What they actually meant then was a new political order.
[00:03:35.824 --> 00:03:47.156]  And what was not foreseen then, but is obvious now from everything that we see and do, what we experience in every day of our life, is the sheer scale and speed and scope of globalisation.
[00:03:47.176 --> 00:03:50.759]  And it's only now that we can begin to understand that the world order
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.541]  We're good to go.
[00:04:13.576 --> 00:04:27.546]  I suggest that the countries that are going to succeed are those that combine flexibility, free trade, open markets, with proper stewardship of the environment and investment in education, infrastructure and innovation.
[00:04:28.206 --> 00:04:42.336]  And the question for us is how we meet and master all these challenges to ensure that Britain enhances its competitiveness in the process and realises what I believe is our destiny of success in this new world order.
[00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:44.637]  So, in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.200]  Well, there you have it.
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.182]  He says New World Order, I think, three more times in 20 seconds.
[00:04:51.843 --> 00:04:54.425]  That's what this, you know, sustainable society is about.
[00:04:54.445 --> 00:04:58.048]  It's about a global government, global tax, and that's why Obama appointed this woman.
[00:04:58.368 --> 00:04:59.188]  We'll be back after this.
[00:04:59.248 --> 00:05:00.229]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:01.890]  I am Jason Vermas, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:13.191 --> 00:05:18.517]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[00:05:18.957 --> 00:05:20.699]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.721]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[00:05:23.362 --> 00:05:26.945]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[00:05:27.366 --> 00:05:30.890]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.995]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of
[00:05:40.418 --> 00:05:43.740]  Selling your keychain is a great way to surprise a potential attacker.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:52.344]  Mr. Defense carries the largest selection of stun guns, air tasers, knives, swords, batons, survival spy and tactical gear.

[00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:12.872]  It is a big idea.
[00:06:12.892 --> 00:06:14.994]  A New World Order.
[00:06:15.694 --> 00:06:20.278]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:06:20.618 --> 00:06:23.400]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.682]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:06:26.222 --> 00:06:28.664]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:29.405 --> 00:06:36.730]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:39.747 --> 00:06:44.690]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:45.191 --> 00:06:48.693]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:49.053 --> 00:06:51.535]  Build a paradise and make great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:51.635 --> 00:06:52.776]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:52.796 --> 00:06:53.556]  They're not after money.
[00:06:53.576 --> 00:06:54.657]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:54.857 --> 00:06:55.578]  They're after power.
[00:06:55.598 --> 00:06:56.518]  That's what they're after these days.

[00:07:05.704 --> 00:07:06.165]  Endgame.
[00:07:06.465 --> 00:07:08.026]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[00:07:08.506 --> 00:07:09.567]  You have been warned.
[00:07:11.088 --> 00:07:14.869]  Do you have aches and pains or suffer from indigestion or inflammation?
[00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:17.550]  Are you tired of feeling restless from insomnia?
[00:07:17.891 --> 00:07:24.914]  These symptoms are produced by negative toxins, but with the correct information, understanding and care, you can cleanse them from your body.
[00:07:25.234 --> 00:07:30.276]  Allomaster.com would like to help you begin the road to recovery with aloe vera.
[00:07:30.376 --> 00:07:39.080]  For over 4,000 years, aloe vera has been known for its therapeutic and healing properties and is widely recognized as the plant that helps alleviate minor burns.

[00:08:05.564 --> 00:08:09.467]  That's 1-800-934-2563 today.
[00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:18.615]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:19.235 --> 00:08:22.198]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:34.892]  Alright folks, we are back.
[00:08:34.972 --> 00:08:36.393]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:38.876 --> 00:08:43.161]  And you know, why do I keep harping on global warming?
[00:08:44.142 --> 00:08:48.867]  I think yesterday we ended the show with a clip from the Great Global Warming Swindle.
[00:08:49.508 --> 00:08:52.691]  Or we did that the other day and somebody else called up about the Great Global Warming Swindle.
[00:08:54.574 --> 00:08:55.414]  It's a patent piece.
[00:09:15.086 --> 00:09:24.556]  Who is the President of Gun Owners of America, a non-profit lobbying organization formed in 1975 to preserve and defend the Second Amendment rights of gun owners.
[00:09:25.076 --> 00:09:26.338]  See folks, these are the real deal.
[00:09:26.378 --> 00:09:27.219]  They're not the NRA.
[00:09:27.259 --> 00:09:33.085]  They're not all about gun regulation and grabbing your semi-automatic and automatic weapons, but they're pro-Second Amendment.
[00:09:33.385 --> 00:09:34.446]  Larry, thank you for joining me.
[00:09:34.947 --> 00:09:36.308]  Well, it's a pleasure to be with you.
[00:09:36.328 --> 00:09:36.989]  Thanks for having me.
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.361]  No, thanks for coming on the show.
[00:09:39.861 --> 00:09:48.325]  You know, we had a caller earlier today asking about conceal and carry permits, and I know that it differs from state to state.
[00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:51.066]  You know, in New York, where I live, it's awfully hard to get one.
[00:09:51.086 --> 00:09:53.407]  I believe he was out of South Dakota.
[00:09:54.028 --> 00:09:57.769]  Do you know anything about the regulations there?
[00:09:57.789 --> 00:10:07.454]  As far as conceal carry regulations are concerned, because there are two states that happily have none, you just carry as a matter of right Vermont and Alaska.
[00:10:08.046 --> 00:10:16.192]  But South Dakota is certainly among the most easy to get the permit, and a huge percentage of the population.
[00:10:16.232 --> 00:10:28.601]  At one time, I think there was something like at least a tenth of the adult population has such a permit, which is partly explainable because it has been on the books.
[00:10:29.282 --> 00:10:30.743]  Their law has been on the books so long.
[00:10:30.783 --> 00:10:37.648]  And we see that every year that there's something like this on the books, more and more people get around to taking advantage of it.
[00:10:38.414 --> 00:10:46.641]  And, you know, the pity is that Americans have grown accustomed to thinking that we can't do something without the government telling us that we can do it.
[00:10:47.302 --> 00:10:57.951]  We think it's better to have a permit law than a prohibition, but we certainly think it's much better still to have something like Vermont or Alaska where no permit is needed.
[00:10:58.635 --> 00:11:01.217]  Yeah, and it's not like crime is out of control in Vermont.
[00:11:01.237 --> 00:11:04.359]  In fact, it's one of the nicest places that I visit up in the Northeast.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.842]  When I get out of upstate New York, it's gorgeous, the people are great.
[00:11:08.082 --> 00:11:13.106]  You would never really know that, you know, people were carrying weapons, because it's just so second nature.
[00:11:13.126 --> 00:11:14.487]  There is no real violence there.
[00:11:15.027 --> 00:11:26.416]  I asked a police official one time, and they're state police, because it's an issue that comes up when you're talking to politicians and police officials, not necessarily rank and file,
[00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:33.437]  In other states, and especially when concealed carry, making it easier for concealed carry legislation comes up.
[00:11:33.897 --> 00:11:40.380]  I said, so how do you guys handle the fact that there's no computer database available to the state police when they pull somebody over?
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.681]  Otherwise, they're approaching a suspect.
[00:11:43.142 --> 00:11:49.445]  How do they handle not knowing whether or not the guy has a concealed carry permit since you don't have them?
[00:11:49.485 --> 00:11:54.767]  He said, well listen, any police officer, regardless of what his computer is telling him that
[00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.051]  The person he just pulled over, whatever.
[00:11:57.591 --> 00:12:03.114]  Oh, he has no concealed carry permit, therefore I can go up there chewing bubblegum and looking at the stars.
[00:12:04.255 --> 00:12:05.855]  You know, he's putting his life in his hands.
[00:12:06.616 --> 00:12:18.262]  And he'd better assume, he doesn't have to be a jerk about it, but he just better be on his guard that the guy could be armed, because the bad guy isn't going to be in the system anyway.
[00:12:18.914 --> 00:12:19.434]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:19.494 --> 00:12:24.956]  The guy that's actually going to pull a gun on you isn't going to be the guy that has the conceal and carry permit.
[00:12:24.976 --> 00:12:32.458]  He's going to be the guy that has warrants out for his arrest and knows it, and knows if he has an interaction with this cop more than five minutes, that he's going to jail.
[00:12:32.498 --> 00:12:38.040]  And that's when you see... I mean, I see him all the time when you're watching Spike TV and you're watching these confrontations.
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.841]  It's never a guy with an actual permit.
[00:12:39.861 --> 00:12:43.762]  It's the guys outside of the car, you know, waiting for the officer to move and then they shoot him.
[00:12:44.355 --> 00:13:13.660]  In fact, the one advantage that I can think of, and it's a temporary advantage, I would like to think, of having concealed carry permit holders is that when you do the research and you find out what the crime rate is among those folks versus the rest of the population that does not have them, the folks that are carrying concealed and have a permit to do so have about 90 to 95 percent less violent crime than the rest of the population.
[00:13:14.136 --> 00:13:26.759]  So when we hear how much that we're putting people in danger to give everybody the opportunity to be carrying a gun, we should think that the proper answer is, oh, well, good.
[00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:37.522]  Let's see if we can expand it because, frankly, wouldn't lowering everybody's crime rate to 95% like the existing carry folks, wouldn't that be a worthwhile objective?
[00:13:38.391 --> 00:13:43.855]  You would think that, but the numbers are always fudged and the fear is always predicated in the media.
[00:13:44.095 --> 00:13:46.477]  Oh, these people with guns, they're dangerous.
[00:13:47.097 --> 00:13:53.421]  And they want to control us, and obviously control is a bit more problematic if everybody's armed.
[00:13:53.581 --> 00:13:56.503]  Ask George III, wasn't that a bit of a difficulty?
[00:13:57.544 --> 00:14:00.987]  Absolutely, and that's why you see this attack on the Second Amendment.
[00:14:01.547 --> 00:14:02.307]  I'd like to get your
[00:14:03.556 --> 00:14:05.437]  Your views on this incoming administration?
[00:14:05.677 --> 00:14:10.238]  We're now a week away from the Obama administration being sworn in.
[00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:18.441]  Just telling me that there's only seven days until Obama is not a settling thing to think about.
[00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:23.663]  I know you're right, and it hasn't been exactly a bullet cherries under bush, hardly.
[00:14:24.107 --> 00:14:27.448]  But Obama, yeah, it's unsettling.
[00:14:28.168 --> 00:14:29.809]  And why is it so unsettling for you?
[00:14:29.929 --> 00:14:40.353]  I mean, obviously you have the people that went out and bought guns, there's record sales out there in ammunition, thinking that he's going to come after their gun rights, and I think that's a real fear.
[00:14:40.373 --> 00:14:48.176]  I can see him going to the people and asking for this, and then the media portraying it in such a way that we really don't have a choice.
[00:14:48.216 --> 00:14:50.717]  That's how many people are behind this Obama movement.
[00:14:51.957 --> 00:14:59.920]  Well, Obama's got a record as a state senator, especially, because he was there for a while, as a real gun banner.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.802]  He doesn't think people should have guns unless they are working for the government.
[00:15:06.743 --> 00:15:13.366]  And if I had to choose between groups of the population, I would say everybody except those working for the government.
[00:15:13.406 --> 00:15:14.326]  After all, they work for us.
[00:15:14.366 --> 00:15:15.407]  They don't work for the government.
[00:15:15.627 --> 00:15:17.327]  They're supposed to be powered by the people, yeah.
[00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:17.988]  Yeah.
[00:15:18.328 --> 00:15:21.109]  So if we're going to be disarming people, which I'm not advocating,
[00:15:21.493 --> 00:15:23.214]  Then it ought to be those that work for the government.
[00:15:23.234 --> 00:15:24.114]  Let's get this straight.
[00:15:24.394 --> 00:15:29.576]  They work for us, and they should do whatever it is we tell them, even if it's a bit goofy.
[00:15:30.357 --> 00:15:33.898]  And they can always not work for us if they don't like those terms.
[00:15:34.118 --> 00:15:40.261]  So we've got a guy that's really anti-gun, and he's got a background that you just can't get away from.
[00:15:40.321 --> 00:15:45.463]  He's tried to do what so many politicians do and sound like he's a man of the middle.
[00:15:46.083 --> 00:15:49.585]  I think he's simply playing the Hegelian dialectic.
[00:15:50.543 --> 00:15:55.427]  Votes one way, he talks another, and he makes you think, oh good, he's finally come to his senses.
[00:15:55.827 --> 00:15:57.409]  So your guard goes down and wham!
[00:15:57.809 --> 00:15:59.630]  The synthesis is, gotcha!
[00:16:01.352 --> 00:16:15.343]  So this guy has put in, for example, as a nominee for Attorney General, the fellow that was there at the Justice Department during the joyful events of Waco.
[00:16:16.304 --> 00:16:19.687]  He's the guy that went and
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.469]  Try to get the Puerto Rican terrorists to accept a pardon.
[00:16:25.649 --> 00:16:27.031]  They had not been seeking one.
[00:16:27.352 --> 00:16:32.701]  They thought it would somehow stain the pristine nature of their
[00:16:33.519 --> 00:17:01.015]  uh... just cause you know they'd only shot a few uh... uh... people uh... in an invasion of uh... washington in the congress but you know that's a little little stuff like that a long time ago and so they'd actually deliberated whether or not to accept the pardon from clinton and this was something that holder himself did and it bypassed even the normal pardon office in the clinton administration so this guy
[00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:13.318]  Is somebody who works around the law, works around established procedures, and he does it to benefit people who are convicted of murder and mayhem.
[00:17:13.678 --> 00:17:17.099]  Meanwhile, he would like to put average gun owners in jail.
[00:17:17.159 --> 00:17:26.864]  He signed on to the friend of the court brief, along with Janet Reno, that was opposing the overturn of the D.C.
[00:17:27.244 --> 00:17:27.804]  gun ban.
[00:17:28.345 --> 00:17:42.090]  He was in favor of people not being able to protect themselves, and obviously there's a penalty in the district, and pretty much even now, yeah, you can have a handgun if you crawl over glass, stand on your head, and do a few other ridiculous things.
[00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.391]  You might be able to get your permit in the District of Columbia.
[00:17:45.691 --> 00:17:47.892]  Well, Holder thinks that's just fine.
[00:17:47.912 --> 00:17:49.292]  The more difficult, the better.
[00:17:49.472 --> 00:17:50.033]  Impossible?
[00:17:50.313 --> 00:17:50.873]  Better still.
[00:17:51.633 --> 00:17:53.194]  At least possible legally.
[00:17:53.614 --> 00:17:56.635]  Obviously, the crooks got their guns quite readily.
[00:17:57.122 --> 00:18:05.287]  in the District of Columbia, but I really don't think that bothers these folks because they don't see crooks as a threat to them and to their system.
[00:18:06.228 --> 00:18:08.649]  I didn't say our government, their system.
[00:18:08.969 --> 00:18:16.134]  They see crooks as people who are on the margin and not with any political agenda.
[00:18:16.514 --> 00:18:24.159]  They view people like Alex Jones, like Gun Owners of America, as having an agenda that's opposed to theirs.
[00:18:24.739 --> 00:18:26.260]  That's what bothers them.
[00:18:26.752 --> 00:18:28.133]  They want to control us.
[00:18:28.433 --> 00:18:32.397]  They don't care about controlling the criminals because they're largely irrelevant.
[00:18:32.857 --> 00:18:35.940]  But we're not, which I guess is somewhat of a compliment.
[00:18:36.581 --> 00:18:38.863]  They don't bother about things that are irrelevant.
[00:18:39.503 --> 00:18:40.644]  But this is Eric Holder.
[00:18:40.724 --> 00:18:44.027]  This is the first nomination out of the box, if you will.
[00:18:44.928 --> 00:18:50.713]  Unconstitutional as it may be, he still will be the nation's chief law enforcement official.
[00:18:51.517 --> 00:19:15.632]  And he will have at his control and at his discretion the bureaucrat levers of power that will enable him to do what Bush has been doing to manufacturers and owners and dealers and I suspect it'll even be more brazen, more harmful, more people in jail, more innocent people in jail than even now.
[00:19:16.992 --> 00:19:23.155]  This is going to be a very rough ride, and I don't see the Republicans holding.
[00:19:23.895 --> 00:19:44.063]  You have to have basically all 41 of them to make anything slow down in the Senate, and so far they haven't been doing very well at all in early votes on the Obama agenda, and you've got just enough that'll flake off that I think we're going to be in real trouble.
[00:19:44.943 --> 00:19:54.928]  I'm Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America, and when we come back I want to talk about that District of Columbia Supreme Court ruling, because in the media it was championed as a win for gun owners.
[00:19:55.148 --> 00:19:57.109]  Oh, you can have guns in D.C.
[00:19:57.689 --> 00:19:59.690]  You only have to do all this to get it.
[00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.452]  See, it was all about regulation, because like he said, the true criminals don't get permits.
[00:20:03.732 --> 00:20:06.774]  It's the Alex Jones Show, Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:10.763 --> 00:20:11.983]  I am so frustrated.
[00:20:12.083 --> 00:20:14.224]  I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[00:20:14.424 --> 00:20:14.704]  What?
[00:20:15.004 --> 00:20:17.584]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[00:20:17.764 --> 00:20:19.024]  I read something and forget.
[00:20:19.184 --> 00:20:20.345]  I forget people's names.
[00:20:20.445 --> 00:20:24.085]  I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[00:20:24.225 --> 00:20:25.866]  I... Okay, slow down.
[00:20:25.966 --> 00:20:28.406]  Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[00:20:28.546 --> 00:20:35.587]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum in deodorants, genetically modified foods, the way the education system taught you.
[00:20:35.687 --> 00:20:37.127]  It's all meant to dumb you down.
[00:20:37.308 --> 00:20:38.828]  You know, I can remember everything now.
[00:20:39.048 --> 00:20:39.968]  Even entire books.
[00:20:40.208 --> 00:20:40.408]  What?
[00:20:40.488 --> 00:20:40.789]  How?
[00:20:41.049 --> 00:20:44.252]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[00:20:44.312 --> 00:20:47.975]  Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.
[00:20:48.096 --> 00:20:57.364]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information, including entire books, after they complete just 60 lessons.
[00:20:57.725 --> 00:21:02.909]  And they offer a no-questions-asked, no-time-limit, money-back guarantee.
[00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.410]  Wow.
[00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:04.391]  What's the website?
[00:21:04.651 --> 00:21:07.915]  Now don't forget, it's pmemory.net.
[00:21:08.115 --> 00:21:10.057]  The letter P, memory dot net.
[00:21:20.239 --> 00:21:21.259]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:22.300]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.580]  This is his ammo.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.941]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:24.961 --> 00:21:26.601]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:26.941 --> 00:21:33.704]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:34.544]  Some U.S.
[00:21:34.584 --> 00:21:40.246]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:40.926 --> 00:21:44.407]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:44.427 --> 00:21:47.228]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:22:10.856 --> 00:22:11.196]  Good day.
[00:22:11.356 --> 00:22:12.917]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:22:12.997 --> 00:22:13.397]  January 13, 2009.
[00:22:14.998 --> 00:22:16.519]  Gold opened this morning at $821.70.
[00:22:17.099 --> 00:22:21.201]  One ounce gold coin can be purchased for $846.29, $423.15 for a half ounce, and $211.57 for the quarter ounce.
[00:22:21.241 --> 00:22:22.061]  That's $846.29, $423.15, and $211.57.
[00:22:28.368 --> 00:22:30.469]  The dollar has fallen to 65% of the euro.
[00:22:30.569 --> 00:22:31.529]  Erosion accelerates.
[00:22:31.609 --> 00:22:38.572]  Mainline talk show hosts are trying to hold on to their support of the conservative movement, keeping focus on the Republican agenda and playing into the hand of the globalists.
[00:22:38.672 --> 00:22:41.873]  Dr. Corsi interviewed Robert Pastor of the American University.
[00:22:42.013 --> 00:22:48.216]  With the sleight of hand and incremental implementation, Pastor admits to the North American Union is being forced upon us.
[00:22:48.656 --> 00:22:53.018]  Corsi uncovers the CFR's plan to build a North American community similar to the EU.
[00:22:53.338 --> 00:22:58.220]  In his report, The North American Union Isn't Going Away, Corsi exposes the deception and trickery.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.842]  Call for your report today, 800-686-2237.
[00:23:01.922 --> 00:23:05.003]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[00:23:05.103 --> 00:23:05.383]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:05.403 --> 00:23:05.583]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:10.672 --> 00:23:20.440]  SouthSummit.com is the place for top name brand knives such as Kershaw, Spyderco, Cold Steel, Gerber, K-Bar, Boker, Leatherman, and more.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.563]  South Summit has one of the largest selections of self-defense products on the web.
[00:23:24.683 --> 00:23:34.531]  Knives, stun guns, police batons, pepper spray, LED flashlights, emergency kits, binoculars, and tactical gear are just some of the great products found on SouthSummit.com.
[00:23:34.591 --> 00:23:39.135]  Receive discounted prices on camping and preparedness products from Camelbak, Kelty, and Eureka.
[00:23:39.175 --> 00:23:39.635]  I think so.
[00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:03.530]  800-234-8654.
[00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:03.770]  That's 1-800-234-8654.
[00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:04.170]  Independence!
[00:24:30.728 --> 00:24:31.569]  What a novel word.
[00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:32.591]  Independent.
[00:24:32.791 --> 00:24:34.433]  You do things on your own.
[00:24:34.614 --> 00:24:35.335]  Free human being.
[00:24:35.415 --> 00:24:36.076]  Sovereign human being.
[00:24:36.096 --> 00:24:36.737]  Who knew?
[00:24:36.877 --> 00:24:40.822]  Before we go back to Larry Pratt of Gut Owners of America.
[00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:46.191]  I want to talk about one of our great sponsors out there, survivalistseeds.com.
[00:24:46.732 --> 00:24:47.932]  Really no gimmicks, folks.
[00:24:48.732 --> 00:24:50.333]  If you want food, grow it yourself.
[00:24:50.353 --> 00:24:53.674]  You can get some of the best seeds out there over at survivalistseeds.com.
[00:24:53.694 --> 00:25:03.778]  They help us pay the bills, and they help people have real food, and we're going to talk about that in about an hour or so when we have Jonas Stolzwitz and Maurice Thompson on.
[00:25:05.427 --> 00:25:16.534]  But you know, it's always nice to have the insurance policy and where I live in upstate New York, I've got like a small little garden and it's actually fun for me and my four-year-old niece to go out there and pick some tomatoes.
[00:25:16.594 --> 00:25:18.956]  She loves it and she picks the snap peas off the wire.
[00:25:19.637 --> 00:25:21.998]  It's fun and then we go have a nice good salad or dinner.
[00:25:22.038 --> 00:25:23.279]  It's good stuff.
[00:25:23.299 --> 00:25:24.600]  Survivaloftheseeds.com.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.262]  Alright, let's go back to Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America.
[00:25:29.203 --> 00:25:32.585]  Larry, before you tell the listeners about this D.C.
[00:25:32.785 --> 00:25:35.307]  Supreme Court ruling that I believe happened over the summer,
[00:25:36.147 --> 00:25:38.248]  Why don't you tell people where they can get their information from you?
[00:25:39.109 --> 00:25:41.450]  GunOwners.org, best place to go.
[00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:57.918]  You could call us toll-free at 888-886-GUNS or 888-886-GUNS, but the place where you get direct access immediately to the information we've got is at GunOwners.org.
[00:25:58.058 --> 00:26:04.802]  You'll find, in fact, I think we still have it for today maybe, a commentary that I did on this DC
[00:26:05.523 --> 00:26:06.063]  We're good to go.
[00:26:33.999 --> 00:26:35.040]  We're in a desperate fight.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:27:02.616]  If he becomes the Attorney General, it's just one more sign that the Republicans are not going to be of any help, that they don't have it figured out yet, that they have been so successively unsuccessful in the last elections, several elections really, because they have decided to become Democrat-lite and, you know, the base doesn't want Democrat-real.
[00:27:03.047 --> 00:27:04.348]  Or Democrat-lite.
[00:27:04.809 --> 00:27:10.094]  They want something that's constitutional, that stands up and opposes these guys.
[00:27:10.214 --> 00:27:17.721]  And the Republicans are still not, by and large, I mean there are exceptions, but most of them have not gotten the message.
[00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.071]  Yeah, I don't think they're going to get the message either.
[00:27:21.252 --> 00:27:24.374]  Well, they're not called a stupid party for nothing.
[00:27:26.015 --> 00:27:30.618]  Well, both parties at this point seem so amalgamated into one agenda.
[00:27:31.059 --> 00:27:35.522]  I mean, even the debates are just, you know, they're milk toast.
[00:27:35.962 --> 00:27:46.045]  You know, it seems like they'll say, not only will they say one thing, but you know, they'll lean towards somebody, but they don't actually take a real position saying, hey, this is what's going to happen when I'm in the presidency.
[00:27:46.385 --> 00:27:52.987]  It's, we'll see what we can do, and of course you have the right to own a gun, but then they don't tell you about all these regulations that are going to come with that.
[00:27:53.247 --> 00:27:58.809]  So why don't you discuss that DC, basically what you have to do to get a gun in DC now.
[00:28:00.069 --> 00:28:05.611]  Well, first of all, we can say that the Heller decision did one thing that was particularly helpful.
[00:28:06.676 --> 00:28:10.957]  It said that the Second Amendment does actually protect an individual right.
[00:28:11.437 --> 00:28:13.078]  Now, we knew that all along.
[00:28:13.158 --> 00:28:15.399]  The Constitution said that all along.
[00:28:15.959 --> 00:28:22.881]  But the importance of the Supreme Court saying that is that the lower courts have to deal with that.
[00:28:23.081 --> 00:28:29.943]  If they don't, that on its face becomes an appealable issue and makes it easier to get bad
[00:28:30.802 --> 00:28:54.073]  Decisions at the lower federal court level brought to the Supreme Court That's going to be important because there's a lot of things that the Heller decision Did not touch on and it means that they're still up for grabs and there's going to be a lot of litigating Between now and when the cows come home The Heller decision said two things which were really the only two things in front of the court.
[00:28:54.133 --> 00:28:59.536]  So in fairness Which is kind of hard for me to do but in fairness to the court
[00:29:00.359 --> 00:29:04.061]  That's what they should have done, was to just simply rule on those two things.
[00:29:04.401 --> 00:29:06.562]  And they came to the right conclusion on both.
[00:29:06.962 --> 00:29:29.573]  It's unconstitutional to ban handguns, and it is unconstitutional to require the encumbrance on other allowable guns, the long guns that the district so graciously allows people to have, had to be encumbered with a trigger lock, and they had to be kept in a safe, and if they were ever brought out,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.602]  And used for self-defense the way the law was written, that would have been breaking the law.
[00:29:34.982 --> 00:29:42.266]  Yeah, it just seems so ridiculous that I'm supposed to keep my gun in a safe if there's something going on in my house.
[00:29:42.866 --> 00:29:47.129]  I mean, I might have to reach for it in a time I don't have time to punch in a code.
[00:29:47.489 --> 00:29:47.829]  Who knew?
[00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:48.989]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:50.530]  I'm Jason Bermas with Larry Pratt.
[00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:51.471]  We'll be back after this.
[00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:53.071]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:02.350]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.831 --> 00:30:04.432]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.452 --> 00:30:08.135]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.938 --> 00:30:12.379]  Attention.
[00:30:12.719 --> 00:30:15.381]  This is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[00:30:15.761 --> 00:30:22.207]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:30:22.847 --> 00:30:23.508]  Here is why.
[00:30:24.309 --> 00:30:34.296]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:30:34.757 --> 00:30:37.139]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:30:37.499 --> 00:30:39.580]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:40.101]  this fall?
[00:30:40.601 --> 00:30:41.102]  Don't wait!
[00:30:41.522 --> 00:30:45.145]  Learn the food shortage skills that can keep you and your family alive in a crisis.

[00:31:06.114 --> 00:31:06.314]  Act now!
[00:31:11.221 --> 00:31:13.244]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:31:13.384 --> 00:31:15.787]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:31:15.807 --> 00:31:18.390]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:19.612]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:31:19.632 --> 00:31:21.254]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:31:21.354 --> 00:31:24.158]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:31:24.178 --> 00:31:28.503]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, the UDC.
[00:31:37.525 --> 00:31:42.407]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:31:46.181 --> 00:31:47.521]  How dare you?
[00:31:48.602 --> 00:31:53.683]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:31:53.703 --> 00:31:56.483]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:31:56.583 --> 00:32:03.005]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:32:03.045 --> 00:32:05.625]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now.
[00:32:05.865 --> 00:32:07.866]  Or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[00:32:08.146 --> 00:32:10.646]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:32:12.367 --> 00:32:13.327]  Hello, I'm Steve Shane.
[00:32:14.127 --> 00:32:17.450]  Many have been afraid they needed their food supplies before the election.
[00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:24.476]  The inauguration, not the election, is the deadline given by the Obama insiders for completing your food supplies.
[00:32:25.177 --> 00:32:36.987]  Joe Biden and Colin Powell both stated that shortly after the inauguration, possibly the 21st or 22nd of January, the new president would be forced by an international incident to make some unpopular decisions.
[00:32:37.968 --> 00:32:41.851]  This functions as an important deadline for getting any food you intend to have.
[00:32:42.472 --> 00:32:49.577]  The unpopular presidential decisions will likely affect restriction of transportation and availability of food distribution.
[00:32:50.517 --> 00:32:55.540]  Order any remaining food needed no later than four weeks before the inauguration to allow for shipping.
[00:32:56.141 --> 00:33:00.163]  Late orders cannot be guaranteed delivery by this deadline for disaster.
[00:33:00.684 --> 00:33:02.064]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633
[00:33:15.117 --> 00:33:18.118]  Alright folks, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.138 --> 00:33:19.918]  I am Jason Burmas, sitting in for the week.
[00:33:38.698 --> 00:33:46.881]  And, uh, you know, I hope you go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and get a hard copy of Fabled Enemies and make ten copies and hand them out.
[00:33:46.921 --> 00:33:51.423]  Or get a hard copy of Alex Jones' Endgame and get ten copies and hand them out.
[00:33:53.344 --> 00:33:55.825]  You know, hold a screening, get the information out there.
[00:33:56.917 --> 00:34:04.082]  Because it's through human communication that we're able to relay these ideas and people actually do start to think for themselves.
[00:34:04.122 --> 00:34:05.163]  They do question things.
[00:34:05.903 --> 00:34:12.627]  And that's what we need now more than ever when we have a president coming into office that expects sacrifice and service.
[00:34:12.647 --> 00:34:18.952]  When you have Rahm Emanuel coming in saying that he is for mandatory conscription of 18 to 25 year olds.
[00:34:19.432 --> 00:34:22.094]  And now you have this new book being published called Grits.
[00:34:22.734 --> 00:34:26.717]  Uh, this guy's been on the trail now for two plus years talking about conscription.
[00:34:26.757 --> 00:34:28.698]  Tom Blankley out of the Washington Times.
[00:34:29.058 --> 00:34:31.580]  And it's all about programming you to be for it.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.802]  And, uh, I'm worried about it.
[00:34:33.822 --> 00:34:35.363]  A lot of people are behind Obama.
[00:34:35.643 --> 00:34:44.649]  And like I said, especially when I'm in New York and I'm going through the mall and I just see shirt after shirt and hat after hat of Obama or yes we can.
[00:34:44.709 --> 00:34:45.930]  And these aren't election shirts.
[00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:51.033]  These are like fashionable, like hip hop style jackets, shirts, like $35 hats.
[00:34:52.834 --> 00:34:54.455]  You know, the culture is being brainwashed.
[00:34:55.235 --> 00:34:59.437]  All right, let's go back to Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America.
[00:34:59.977 --> 00:35:02.158]  Larry, why don't you tell people how they can get this information?
[00:35:02.178 --> 00:35:03.419]  What's the website and the number?
[00:35:03.439 --> 00:35:11.162]  And then I'd like you to tell me, why is it so hard for a New Yorker to get a carry and conceal permit as opposed to these other states?
[00:35:11.222 --> 00:35:19.566]  I mean, I've often wondered why it is that my buddy who was in the National Guard couldn't get a carry and conceal permit once he got back from Iraq.
[00:35:20.848 --> 00:35:38.796]  Well, GunOwners.org is where you're going to find the information about what we're up to at the federal level, the congressional lobbying that we're doing, particularly to draw people's attention to the alerts that we keep a log of the current ones right there on the home page.
[00:35:38.816 --> 00:35:48.540]  So when you go to GunOwners.org, you'll be able to see the things that we're working on, the things of concern, and what people can do about it with a few easy clicks, sending off email.
[00:35:49.268 --> 00:35:54.630]  To their senators, their representatives, whatever is the appropriate recipient here in Washington.
[00:35:55.110 --> 00:36:02.053]  In New York, you had something that went on the books relatively early in this country, a Sullivan Act.
[00:36:03.694 --> 00:36:05.935]  In my mind, it has a rather ironic history.
[00:36:06.495 --> 00:36:11.157]  The name Sullivan might suggest correctly.
[00:36:11.667 --> 00:36:39.567]  that the uh... namesake is irish it was an irish state senator sullivan who was importuned by some of his criminal constituents the irish mafia as it were uh... that they didn't like the influx of these italian mafia coming in from southern europe and uh... they were basically hittin' on the turf of the fellas that were already there and they didn't like it and so they
[00:36:40.756 --> 00:36:59.900]  In the name of crime control, the constant handmaiden of these Scalawag politicians, in the name of crime control, they enacted the Sullivan Act, targeting, basically, even though the language was general, targeting these Italian mafia that needed to be controlled.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.660]  Well, it shows that even crooks can be stupid.
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:07.281]  Here they are, willing to break the law, six waves from Sunday, and they assume
[00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:35.088]  that a gun control law is going to disarm their opponents but when the politicians worded it naturally they worded it as a general matter so that persons and people and citizens of New York so forth were the targets and the initial impetus behind the law has been long forgotten and instead of the Italian mafia being the target now it's the free citizenry being the target
[00:37:35.472 --> 00:37:41.718]  Which is the way politicians really like it, and there just hasn't been the horsepower to back it off.
[00:37:41.798 --> 00:37:50.366]  You can find similar laws in other states that have actually been pushed back.
[00:37:50.507 --> 00:37:59.135]  Virginia had one that for years was being applied in a very arbitrary fashion by local judges.
[00:37:59.679 --> 00:38:20.683]  And even though, for instance, Oliver North was able to show that terrorist Abu Nidal actually had a contract out on his life, the courts decided, oh, right before an election that he was running for Senate, you might say, that he wasn't a person of good enough character to be able to get a concealed carry permit.
[00:38:20.983 --> 00:38:28.565]  Well, after that fiasco, we got then State Senator Virgil Goode, who later went on to serve with distinction in the U.S.
[00:38:28.585 --> 00:38:29.425]  House of Representatives,
[00:38:30.049 --> 00:38:35.590]  to change the concealed carry law so that discretion was taken away from these judges.
[00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.771]  That's something that needs to be done and would help enormously in New York.
[00:38:40.171 --> 00:38:47.912]  If you just made it into the kind of law you have in Virginia, it wouldn't be quite as good for other reasons, but it would help enormously.
[00:38:48.592 --> 00:38:55.314]  If you go in, you make your application, they can't prove that you're a crook or, you know, some other disqualified person.
[00:38:55.554 --> 00:38:57.614]  They gotta give you the permit.
[00:38:58.001 --> 00:39:03.244]  And that's what we did to take it away from the judges in Virginia.
[00:39:03.284 --> 00:39:06.606]  We've just never been able to do that in New York.
[00:39:07.226 --> 00:39:08.327]  Yeah, New York's a tough one.
[00:39:08.847 --> 00:39:17.492]  Larry, in the next 90 seconds, why don't you tell gun owners out there, people who are pro-Second Amendment, what they can do today to help ensure their gun rights for the future?
[00:39:18.052 --> 00:39:22.475]  Well, I think it's important that the people not stop speaking out.
[00:39:22.595 --> 00:39:25.076]  If the politicians think we've gone away,
[00:39:25.728 --> 00:39:33.031]  They're going to just be all the more unaccountable and unconcerned about the opinion of folks back home.
[00:39:33.852 --> 00:39:52.921]  There's been a reluctance so far on the part of Democrats, in particular, to initiate anti-gun legislation unless they can get the NRA to support it, thus baptizing it, making it respectable, not even really gun control, as long as it has that kind of
[00:39:53.266 --> 00:40:17.261]  across the spectrum support and we've got to make enough noise that no matter what the NRA does the politicians will understand that they're still playing with fire the same fire that burned them in 1994 when the Democrats lost control of the Congress over the gun issue and when Al Gore lost the presidency over the gun issue now
[00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:31.039]  The Republicans need to hear from folks at home as much as the Democrats, because the Republicans have never figured out that if it hurts their opponents, then it would benefit Republicans to make their opponents vote on it.
[00:40:31.819 --> 00:40:40.401]  That's something that is going to be harder in this Congress, because the rules are not favorable and they're not changing them in our favor.
[00:40:40.882 --> 00:40:45.463]  But nevertheless, the Republicans need to hear from folks who don't agree.
[00:40:47.404 --> 00:40:57.106]  Orrin Hatch right now is the guy that's selling out the cause on trying to fight Eric Holder's nomination as Attorney General.
[00:40:57.206 --> 00:41:13.449]  Orrin Hatch has already broken ranks with the small Republican caucus, and if we don't have his vote, we won't be able to, unless we can get a Democrat from somewhere, mount an opposition to Eric Holder through a filibuster threat.
[00:41:13.889 --> 00:41:15.389]  Thank you very much, Orrin Hatch.
[00:41:15.711 --> 00:41:17.786]  The quote, conservative from Utah.
[00:41:19.301 --> 00:41:21.963]  Well, Larry, it's politics as usual in my mind.
[00:41:22.003 --> 00:41:23.584]  They say one thing and they do another.
[00:41:23.624 --> 00:41:24.865]  I thank you so much for joining us.
[00:41:24.925 --> 00:41:28.807]  It's Gun Owners of America, and I want to shift gears right now.
[00:41:29.268 --> 00:41:33.991]  We only got a couple seconds in between, but I want to play this Metallica video.
[00:41:34.851 --> 00:41:36.432]  I think it's important for people to see.
[00:41:36.833 --> 00:41:44.458]  It brings up a lot of the things that we talk about, from eugenics to chemtrails to, you know, the light that is not light is here.
[00:41:44.478 --> 00:41:45.398]  All right, let's play the video.
[00:41:45.418 --> 00:41:48.521]  PrisonPlanet.tv is where to watch this, folks, if you're a subscriber.
[00:41:48.541 --> 00:41:49.101]  All right, hit it.
[00:42:03.288 --> 00:42:05.890]  Of course, technical difficulty for some reason.
[00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:08.591]  Do we not have this loaded up?
[00:42:11.312 --> 00:42:13.573]  I could have swore that we had it loaded up.
[00:42:15.815 --> 00:42:18.256]  Of course, of course it's not going to work, right?
[00:42:24.227 --> 00:42:26.909]  Well, folks, I really, really want to play this for you.
[00:42:27.249 --> 00:42:28.891]  I don't know why it's not playing.
[00:42:28.931 --> 00:42:31.693]  Maybe we can refresh the page and hopefully it'll come up.
[00:42:32.333 --> 00:42:35.836]  But really, again, I mean, it's got a lot of interesting things in it.
[00:42:36.656 --> 00:42:40.599]  And, you know, for them at the end to play actual news clips of, here we go.
[00:42:41.219 --> 00:42:41.680]  There we go.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:42.540]  Boom.
[00:42:42.981 --> 00:42:44.021]  Alright, let's get the volume on it.
[00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:47.824]  Do we have the volume on it?
[00:44:37.147 --> 00:44:40.230]  Luck runs out.
[00:44:42.873 --> 00:44:45.736]  Crawl from the wreckage one more time.
[00:44:45.776 --> 00:44:48.139]  Horrific memories whiz the mind.
[00:44:48.439 --> 00:44:50.902]  Dark, rutted, cold and hard to turn.
[00:44:51.222 --> 00:44:53.705]  Path of destruction, feel it burn.
[00:44:53.925 --> 00:44:56.208]  Still alive, incarnation.
[00:45:38.591 --> 00:45:38.651]  Ha!
[00:46:05.564 --> 00:46:06.485]  Yeah, we're good.
[00:46:13.889 --> 00:46:15.751]  The dark runs out.
[00:46:18.373 --> 00:46:23.678]  The light that is not light is here to crush you out with your own fear.
[00:46:23.958 --> 00:46:26.580]  You hide, you hide, but will be found.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:31.464]  Release your grip without a sound.
[00:46:31.564 --> 00:46:35.207]  Still life, immolation.
[00:46:35.227 --> 00:46:36.328]  Still life, infamy.
[00:46:36.388 --> 00:46:38.450]  Hallucination, heresy.
[00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:39.211]  Still you run.
[00:47:14.465 --> 00:47:15.525]  I think so.
[00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:47.769]  We're good to go.
[00:50:06.764 --> 00:50:08.867]  Yeah.
[00:50:54.986 --> 00:50:58.932]  Alright folks, we're going to be back after this with the Chemtrail News portion of that.
[00:50:59.013 --> 00:51:00.916]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:13.811]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[00:51:14.312 --> 00:51:18.875]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with the reflective spray.
[00:51:19.335 --> 00:51:21.196]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[00:51:21.276 --> 00:51:22.437]  We are under the microscope.
[00:51:22.617 --> 00:51:26.460]  Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:30.022]  But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.
[00:51:30.282 --> 00:51:33.384]  Have a fighting chance with SprayYourPlate.com's Photoblocker.
[00:51:33.564 --> 00:51:34.205]  We're good to go.
[00:51:48.664 --> 00:51:49.305]  I think so.
[00:52:10.882 --> 00:52:17.284]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:17.644 --> 00:52:19.625]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:20.285 --> 00:52:21.325]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:21.845 --> 00:52:22.365]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:22.646 --> 00:52:23.546]  This is his ammo.
[00:52:23.606 --> 00:52:25.006]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:25.026 --> 00:52:26.647]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:27.007 --> 00:52:33.749]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:34.149 --> 00:52:34.589]  Some U.S.
[00:52:34.629 --> 00:52:40.291]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:40.971 --> 00:52:44.514]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:44.794 --> 00:52:47.276]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:10.674 --> 00:53:11.094]  I think so.
[00:53:29.053 --> 00:53:29.333]  I think so.
[00:53:58.291 --> 00:54:02.132]  Ask yourself, why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?
[00:54:02.372 --> 00:54:04.733]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[00:54:04.893 --> 00:54:06.714]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today!
[00:54:06.754 --> 00:54:09.935]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:54:10.995 --> 00:54:18.937]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:54:22.398 --> 00:54:23.799]  From one killer band to the next!
[00:54:24.867 --> 00:54:26.467]  Metallica Rage Against The Machine.
[00:54:26.487 --> 00:54:29.008]  The Info War continues, folks.
[00:54:29.068 --> 00:54:30.628]  And why did we just play that Metallica video?
[00:54:30.648 --> 00:54:33.669]  Well, we're going to play the very, very end of that horror show.
[00:54:33.689 --> 00:54:38.609]  But if you saw it at the very end, you're on PrisonPlan.TV, you saw them put up the chemtrails.
[00:54:38.649 --> 00:54:44.470]  And the chemtrails is what killed the larger part of the zombie population, because it had chromium and barium in it.
[00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:48.371]  But now, at the very end, they're going to play actual news reports.
[00:54:48.411 --> 00:54:48.731]  Listen.
[00:54:50.051 --> 00:54:51.151]  Bring it back, guys.
[00:54:56.013 --> 00:54:57.094]  ...now getting widespread attention.
[00:54:57.134 --> 00:55:00.176]  It seemed like some mornings it was just criss-crossing the whole sky.
[00:55:00.216 --> 00:55:05.039]  They were just, it was just like a giant... Recently, News 12 had the sample tested at a lab.
[00:55:05.399 --> 00:55:05.959]  The results?
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.721]  A high level of barium.
[00:55:08.961 --> 00:55:09.882]  6.8 parts per million.
[00:55:10.342 --> 00:55:13.063]  More than three times the toxic level set by the EPA.
[00:55:13.083 --> 00:55:17.426]  But at the same time, they added the caveat that proving the source is a whole other matter.
[00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:20.191]  Proving the source is a whole other matter.
[00:55:20.211 --> 00:55:23.054]  Well, who else would be able to have planes in U.S.
[00:55:23.134 --> 00:55:26.117]  airspace other than the United States government spraying chemicals?
[00:55:26.577 --> 00:55:34.125]  And again, they spin it as to the arsenic and the barium in there are basically to thwart a Russian plot to zombify America.
[00:55:34.965 --> 00:55:36.146]  I don't care for that spin.
[00:55:36.206 --> 00:55:37.227]  I don't like that spin.
[00:55:37.267 --> 00:55:46.695]  But there's a really crazy music video from the Tunguska event to Russian Eugenics to Chemtrails all being intertwined.
[00:55:46.735 --> 00:55:48.576]  I encourage people to check that out.
[00:55:48.616 --> 00:55:49.777]  We've got a few minutes for calls.
[00:55:49.797 --> 00:55:50.978]  I know a lot of people have been holding.
[00:55:51.279 --> 00:55:53.280]  And then we're going to go to Jonas Stoltzfitz in the
[00:55:54.401 --> 00:55:57.764]  Top of the hour and then after 30 after, we're going to have Maurice Thompson.
[00:55:58.264 --> 00:56:01.367]  We'll take your calls again at the bottom of the last hour.
[00:56:02.007 --> 00:56:04.529]  Let's go to Bob in California.
[00:56:04.589 --> 00:56:05.390]  Bob, what's on your mind?
[00:56:07.172 --> 00:56:07.732]  Yeah, how you doing?
[00:56:07.772 --> 00:56:09.614]  I was actually calling for a question for Larry.
[00:56:09.654 --> 00:56:10.574]  I don't know if he's still on.
[00:56:10.995 --> 00:56:13.016]  He's not, but maybe the next time we get him.
[00:56:13.117 --> 00:56:14.037]  What was your question for him?
[00:56:14.057 --> 00:56:18.381]  The question was actually, I wanted to know his opinion on apple seed rifle clinics.
[00:56:18.781 --> 00:56:21.844]  And because the gun culture is so divided, I was going to ask
[00:56:22.583 --> 00:56:28.645]  If they're doing any cross-pollinating with other organizations, such as Appleseed or any others, try to come up with a unified front.
[00:56:28.945 --> 00:56:30.566]  Well, I would throw him an email.
[00:56:30.606 --> 00:56:35.688]  I'm not quite sure I know Alex plans on having him on again when he gets back, so hopefully we can answer that question then.
[00:56:35.728 --> 00:56:37.989]  Let's jump to Robert in Texas.
[00:56:38.089 --> 00:56:39.009]  Robert, what's on your mind?
[00:56:39.889 --> 00:56:40.370]  Jason.
[00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:40.990]  Yes.
[00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:42.430]  Great to talk to you.
[00:56:42.891 --> 00:56:43.771]  First time caller.
[00:56:43.791 --> 00:56:44.851]  Cool.
[00:56:45.672 --> 00:56:50.694]  I called with a question for Mr. Pratt, but I'll just go ahead and put the issue out there.
[00:56:52.847 --> 00:57:11.084]  Fifteen years ago, here in Texas, I was felonized for a DWI, and according to the penal code of the state of Texas, five years after I have done my time, whether it was in prison or completed parole, I'm allowed to own firearms again.
[00:57:12.926 --> 00:57:18.070]  But, of course, federal law says that for the rest of my life, I am to be defenseless.
[00:57:19.812 --> 00:57:33.302]  So, what I was going to ask Mr. Pratt, and I guess I should put it out there, is I wonder if there's any organization out there at this time, as far as a Second Amendment organization, who is pursuing that legally.
[00:57:33.343 --> 00:57:44.711]  Because, you know, with the Heller decision, I know they threw the felon thing in there, but they said that the Second Amendment was a God-given right, the same as freedom of religion or freedom of expression.
[00:57:45.572 --> 00:57:48.614]  So, you know, if that's the case, how can they take it away from me?
[00:57:49.522 --> 00:57:50.422]  That's a great question.
[00:57:50.663 --> 00:57:50.963]  You know what?
[00:57:51.283 --> 00:57:53.004]  I would say go to Gun Owners of America.
[00:57:53.464 --> 00:57:54.204]  Send them an email.
[00:57:54.805 --> 00:58:00.247]  Larry Pratt is a lot more prevalent than me with his gun owner knowledge.
[00:58:00.768 --> 00:58:04.049]  Being a Second Amendment advocate, that's about all I know.
[00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.990]  I don't really handle a gun.
[00:58:05.330 --> 00:58:09.392]  I got a .22 in my house that's my roommate's and he's a hunter.
[00:58:09.512 --> 00:58:11.113]  That's why we have that there.
[00:58:11.293 --> 00:58:12.714]  It's deer season not so long ago.
[00:58:14.717 --> 00:58:15.739]  I wish I knew a little bit more.
[00:58:15.759 --> 00:58:18.624]  Alright, let's go to Brandon in Canada.
[00:58:18.664 --> 00:58:19.446]  Brandon, what's on your mind?
[00:58:19.466 --> 00:58:21.449]  How you doing, Jason?
[00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:22.210]  Good.
[00:58:22.952 --> 00:58:23.513]  Quickly, Brandon.
[00:58:23.533 --> 00:58:24.494]  We've got about 30 seconds.
[00:58:26.128 --> 00:58:27.468]  Okay, you want to put me back on hold then?
[00:58:27.889 --> 00:58:28.269]  I can't.
[00:58:28.749 --> 00:58:29.089]  You know what?
[00:58:29.229 --> 00:58:29.930]  I will put you on hold.
[00:58:29.970 --> 00:58:31.771]  We'll take your call at the top of the hour.
[00:58:31.811 --> 00:58:34.833]  Then we'll go to Jonas Stoltzfitz and Maurice Thompson.
[00:58:35.173 --> 00:58:39.876]  That's right, they're SWAT teaming people who are trying to sell you healthy milk.
[00:58:39.956 --> 00:58:40.496]  Imagine that.
[00:58:40.536 --> 00:58:44.359]  We're just going to take it, put it under government control, cut out the small farmer.
[00:58:44.399 --> 00:58:46.640]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:59:00.942 --> 00:59:02.523]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:59:02.644 --> 00:59:07.227]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:59:07.387 --> 00:59:10.129]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:10.349 --> 00:59:13.211]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:13.391 --> 00:59:18.094]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:18.334 --> 00:59:19.275]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:19.455 --> 00:59:22.378]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:22.698 --> 00:59:29.604]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:29.704 --> 00:59:32.807]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[01:00:03.647 --> 01:00:05.548]  Waging War on Corruption.
[01:00:06.028 --> 01:00:08.949]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:19.733 --> 01:00:26.196]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[01:00:27.056 --> 01:00:29.457]  And we'll be going to Jonas Stoltzfus in a moment.
[01:00:30.638 --> 01:00:37.543]  Back in May, the Feds launched a, this is off World Net Daily, by the way, Gestapo raid over raw milk.
[01:00:37.563 --> 01:00:43.687]  They went in and took $30,000 worth of milk, cheese, and other, and butter.
[01:00:43.707 --> 01:00:46.689]  I mean, basically they took this guy's farm away from him.
[01:00:46.729 --> 01:00:48.110]  They took his product away.
[01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:49.671]  They took his way of life away.
[01:00:50.752 --> 01:00:51.733]  And since then,
[01:00:53.217 --> 01:01:01.101]  Jones and Judy Stoltzfitz have started the Pennsylvania Independent Consumer and Farmers Association in a direct response to that.
[01:01:01.842 --> 01:01:03.303]  It's just a crazy undercover sting.
[01:01:03.323 --> 01:01:04.443]  We'll get to him in one moment.
[01:01:04.483 --> 01:01:06.224]  Brandon, you called in.
[01:01:06.244 --> 01:01:07.025]  What do you want to talk about?
[01:01:07.685 --> 01:01:14.109]  Well, I just want to know, what is the majority of Americans going to do when the Constitution is put on hold?
[01:01:14.229 --> 01:01:18.931]  I know up here in Canada, our moron of a Prime Minister just corroded Parliament to the 26th of January.
[01:01:20.953 --> 01:01:25.235]  Basically, he's got veto power, he can do whatever he wants between now and then, sign any agreements.
[01:01:26.055 --> 01:01:30.116]  And it wouldn't be, you know, privy to the people because Parliament's not in session.
[01:01:30.636 --> 01:01:34.298]  So I just want to know, when the massive crisis happens, what's the majority of the people going to do?
[01:01:34.318 --> 01:01:37.319]  Are they going to stand up and fight when these government terrorists come kick in your door?
[01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:38.771]  Or what?
[01:01:39.291 --> 01:01:39.771]  I don't know.
[01:01:40.051 --> 01:01:43.174]  I mean, I expect a lot of them to lay down, to be honest with you, Brandon.
[01:01:43.234 --> 01:01:44.795]  Have you seen that guy, J.J.
[01:01:44.835 --> 01:01:45.395]  Johnson?
[01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:47.136]  He was on C-SPAN.
[01:01:48.257 --> 01:01:49.318]  He was from Ohio.
[01:01:49.738 --> 01:02:01.987]  They kept calling him a Nazi because he was a black man and he was, like, stainless and we're starting to build, like, not compounds, but the people in the communities are, like, arming themselves to protect themselves because they have rights.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.281]  And they're not going to lie down and die for this.
[01:02:20.649 --> 01:02:39.890]  uh... you know the public mindset against the second amendment against malicious against uh... you know communes and you know they made david correction by the way i'm no crash fan into you know hit him being a religious not into an excuse to kill a bunch of women and children so you know i i don't expect much of an opposition from the american people i thank you for the call
[01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:43.512]  Alright, with that said, we have Jonas Stolzfus on the line.
[01:02:43.532 --> 01:02:44.673]  I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[01:02:44.893 --> 01:02:48.196]  Out of the Pennsylvania Independent Consumers and Farmers Association.
[01:02:48.776 --> 01:02:53.460]  And they started this group, you know, really right after this raid in May.
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:56.342]  Why don't you just give us some background on this raid, Jonas?
[01:02:57.223 --> 01:02:58.404]  Well, some background.
[01:02:58.504 --> 01:03:02.146]  Actually, Alex, there were three raids altogether.
[01:03:02.166 --> 01:03:05.409]  One happened, give or take August.
[01:03:06.751 --> 01:03:10.234]  Uh, $20,000 or so of stuff and equipment was taken.
[01:03:10.254 --> 01:03:17.360]  Another, uh, the next spring, again, about $20,000, $25,000 worth of stuff was taken.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:32.692]  And the third one then, after an undercover agent by the name of Kirk, that's K-I-R-K from the Carlisle State Police Barracks, went into Mark Knolt's farm and, uh, went in with an old beat-up pickup truck.
[01:03:34.049 --> 01:03:45.236]  And the parents weren't home and so he talked to the children, a young man, and used my name saying that, he said, I'm new in the area.
[01:03:46.116 --> 01:03:50.359]  And Jonas and Judy said that this would be a good place for me to buy raw milk.
[01:03:51.719 --> 01:03:53.340]  Now there's a witness to this whole thing.
[01:03:54.441 --> 01:04:01.045]  And he settled for two gallons of raw milk after giving his sob story about being new in the area and knowing me.
[01:04:02.787 --> 01:04:07.468]  And when he left the site, he said, uh, say hello to Jonas for me.
[01:04:08.488 --> 01:04:11.629]  And promptly took the milk to the PDA.
[01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:14.310]  They confirmed, yes, it was raw milk.
[01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:20.471]  And they promptly, within a very few days, came and raided him again.
[01:04:20.491 --> 01:04:22.831]  This time they got $10,000 worth of stuff from him.
[01:04:24.072 --> 01:04:30.693]  So we have an ongoing case of harassment and persecution
[01:04:31.778 --> 01:04:39.630]  Uh, here's a farmer with 10 children working hard, making a living, making stuff that people want to buy.
[01:04:40.431 --> 01:04:45.759]  People of their own free will come down his driveway and pay him good money for this stuff.
[01:04:46.451 --> 01:04:51.714]  He can make a living, but the state thinks that he has to have permission.
[01:04:51.754 --> 01:04:57.637]  The state wants to regulate not only what we do in our lives, but what we put in our bodies.
[01:04:58.237 --> 01:04:59.538]  And that's what this is all about.
[01:04:59.578 --> 01:05:00.398]  We'll be back after this.
[01:05:00.418 --> 01:05:01.379]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:05:01.459 --> 01:05:03.240]  I am Jason Bermas, InfoWars.com.
[01:05:11.215 --> 01:05:14.857]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:05:14.937 --> 01:05:20.539]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:05:20.659 --> 01:05:24.721]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:05:25.001 --> 01:05:27.282]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[01:05:27.462 --> 01:05:33.344]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[01:05:33.404 --> 01:05:34.064]  We're good to go!
[01:06:02.691 --> 01:06:05.515]  GoldenFLAX.com or call 800-387-5516.
[01:06:05.555 --> 01:06:08.299]  That's 800-387-5516.
[01:06:08.719 --> 01:06:10.602]  Free shipping included.
[01:06:10.622 --> 01:06:17.691]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:06:18.051 --> 01:06:19.714]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:20.866 --> 01:06:21.707]  Who is the enemy?
[01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:22.728]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:23.008 --> 01:06:24.030]  This is his ammo.
[01:06:24.050 --> 01:06:25.371]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:25.411 --> 01:06:27.033]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:27.393 --> 01:06:34.140]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:34.981]  Some U.S.
[01:06:35.021 --> 01:06:40.667]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:41.367 --> 01:06:44.870]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:47.673]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:07:11.326 --> 01:07:14.607]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:07:14.767 --> 01:07:18.848]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:07:19.028 --> 01:07:30.451]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:07:30.691 --> 01:07:36.513]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:37.374]  We're good to go.
[01:07:59.906 --> 01:08:03.510]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:22.509 --> 01:08:23.790]  Alright folks, we are back.
[01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:24.811]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:24.871 --> 01:08:29.055]  I am Jason Vermas, filmmaker of Loose Change and Fabled Enemies, sitting in.
[01:08:29.876 --> 01:08:31.697]  Before we go back to Jonas Stolzfus.
[01:08:32.816 --> 01:08:36.699]  Look, I gotta give another disclaimer, I guess, for this Metallica video I just played.
[01:08:36.719 --> 01:08:42.063]  You know, I played it for the PrisonPlanet.tv audience because it covers eugenics, it covers chemtrails.
[01:08:42.983 --> 01:08:50.929]  You know, for a platinum-selling artist to cover these issues and to play actual news clips at the end of their music video is newsworthy.
[01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:55.872]  So all you listeners out there that think this has turned into some kind of hard rock metal show, it hasn't.
[01:08:55.953 --> 01:08:57.594]  We played one song in four hours.
[01:08:58.134 --> 01:08:59.875]  I apologize to anybody we offended.
[01:09:00.976 --> 01:09:03.258]  Alright, let's get on to bigger and better topics.
[01:09:03.298 --> 01:09:10.122]  The fact that the federal government is trying to regulate what we can eat and put into our bodies, and they're going after all these organic farmers.
[01:09:10.643 --> 01:09:17.667]  They want us to eat these GMO foods that are full of poison, and they want to put the small-time farmer out of business in general.
[01:09:17.908 --> 01:09:25.313]  If they can't control them with their surplus farming and having them destroy their corn crop, then they have no use for them, and that's why we've seen
[01:09:25.993 --> 01:09:29.434]  Just really a demise in this country of the family farm.
[01:09:29.474 --> 01:09:33.936]  I live in upstate New York and more and more people every month have to give up their family farm.
[01:09:33.956 --> 01:09:35.317]  It's pretty crazy to me, Jonas.
[01:09:36.157 --> 01:09:36.837]  It's really bad.
[01:09:37.538 --> 01:09:39.258]  Did you know about the Sharon Palmer case?
[01:09:39.758 --> 01:09:41.019]  No, please enlighten us.
[01:09:41.039 --> 01:09:41.319]  Okay.
[01:09:41.699 --> 01:09:49.402]  Sharon Palmer, single mom, California, goat farmer, makes goat cheese for sale in a farmer's market.
[01:09:49.862 --> 01:09:51.023]  She has 12 children.
[01:09:51.621 --> 01:10:03.211]  Just, I think it was December 18th, an undercover agent, here's another case of undercover agents, come into her farm that she had just moved to from another location, and begged her to buy cheese from her.
[01:10:03.351 --> 01:10:07.995]  Oh, she said, I can't sell cheese, you'll have to go to the farmer's market to buy it, because I can't sell it here at the farm.
[01:10:08.876 --> 01:10:14.941]  Well, he, may never get to the she, I forget, talked her into it, finally said, okay, I'll give you some cheese.
[01:10:15.962 --> 01:10:19.505]  So she gave the person some cheese, the undercover agent left,
[01:10:20.154 --> 01:10:25.717]  Sharon left a few minutes later, went down the road, and very shortly was arrested and brought back to the farm.
[01:10:25.797 --> 01:10:33.802]  Only to discover she was swarmed with undercover agents, enforcement agencies, which went over her farm to check it out.
[01:10:33.862 --> 01:10:35.543]  Meanwhile, they handcuffed this woman.
[01:10:35.563 --> 01:10:36.243]  Did you get that?
[01:10:36.463 --> 01:10:41.926]  Handcuffed her like a criminal druggie and threw her back in the back of their car.
[01:10:42.867 --> 01:10:43.687]  The Kreese Cruiser.
[01:10:44.208 --> 01:10:46.209]  Then took her in, kept her overnight.
[01:10:46.549 --> 01:10:48.310]  The children were deported off to relatives.
[01:10:49.315 --> 01:10:51.156]  Well, the goats were left to fend for themselves.
[01:10:51.417 --> 01:10:52.217]  Kept her overnight.
[01:10:52.718 --> 01:10:52.978]  Alright.
[01:10:53.358 --> 01:10:53.838]  In jail.
[01:10:54.199 --> 01:10:54.599]  For what?
[01:10:55.119 --> 01:10:55.860]  Selling cocaine?
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:56.120]  No.
[01:10:56.541 --> 01:10:59.022]  Selling goat cheese.
[01:10:59.283 --> 01:10:59.943]  Did you get that?
[01:11:00.484 --> 01:11:00.864]  Food.
[01:11:01.544 --> 01:11:03.306]  We got something really wrong here.
[01:11:04.008 --> 01:11:09.589]  It's the fact that our undercover agents are spending time on this.
[01:11:09.629 --> 01:11:12.870]  It's not like anybody's complaining that they're getting sick from the food.
[01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:15.531]  The food is probably the healthiest food that you can get.
[01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:23.092]  It doesn't go through all these processes where they put all these nasty preservatives.
[01:11:23.132 --> 01:11:28.533]  You can't even pronounce half the things that are in your food now.
[01:11:29.153 --> 01:11:30.834]  Even when you're buying produce, when you're buying
[01:11:32.074 --> 01:11:32.875]  Beef or chicken.
[01:11:33.415 --> 01:11:37.457]  A lot of that meat is now cloned when you go to Walmart or Price Chopper or these bigger chains.
[01:11:37.697 --> 01:11:42.760]  Your best bet is to go to these farmers market and now the government is trying to regulate that so it's impossible.
[01:11:43.381 --> 01:11:44.061]  It's really bad.
[01:11:44.481 --> 01:11:53.727]  The story, the complete story on this Sharon Palmer case can be picked up at thecompletepatient.com if anyone's interested.
[01:11:54.367 --> 01:11:57.649]  Very, very, a lot of details are interesting.
[01:11:58.249 --> 01:12:01.151]  Mark McCarthy made a comment on that
[01:12:02.209 --> 01:12:06.752]  Um, on that case, he said, this is totally, totally, totally ridiculous.
[01:12:06.812 --> 01:12:10.775]  We have, what we have here is tyrants posing as police officers.
[01:12:10.895 --> 01:12:15.838]  We have, we have people who have no conscience posing as police officers.
[01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:17.219]  It's really, really bad.
[01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:25.064]  It's like we are descending in some locations into like a Gestapo Nazi Germany situation.
[01:12:25.645 --> 01:12:27.326]  It's really, it's really bad.
[01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:35.390]  And you know, a lot of people can't even think that way because they honestly believe in this, you know, new president, hope, and change.
[01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:48.381]  I mean, it's been all over the television, but they don't realize that, all right, for instance, you know, a few months back a teacher got in trouble because he created his own Obama Youth Corps of young African American men, and just bring it up yourself.
[01:12:48.421 --> 01:12:51.044]  I mean, he's got them chanting Alpha Omega and, you know,
[01:12:51.824 --> 01:12:53.306]  I'm gonna do this for Obama.
[01:12:53.346 --> 01:12:54.607]  So they don't see that.
[01:12:54.667 --> 01:12:56.228]  That's like a Nazi youth.
[01:12:56.288 --> 01:13:00.933]  I mean, Obama gave his global citizenship speech in Berlin, Germany.
[01:13:01.333 --> 01:13:03.415]  You know, this guy is a front for the globalists.
[01:13:03.495 --> 01:13:09.921]  I think you're gonna see not only regulation of food everywhere, but you're just gonna see a massive regulation of everything from our economic system to
[01:13:11.081 --> 01:13:13.742]  I mean, possibly our roadways and our toll roads.
[01:13:13.762 --> 01:13:15.942]  I mean, they're talking about a new New Deal.
[01:13:16.203 --> 01:13:21.084]  You know, this is something that was done in the Great Depression, or to bring us out of the Great Depression, by Roosevelt.
[01:13:21.144 --> 01:13:24.325]  And now, the news is prepping us that we're in this other Great Depression.
[01:13:24.345 --> 01:13:33.688]  You'd think, in a Great Depression, when people are going to have a hard time making money and buying food, that you'd want a lot of farms in this country to provide that food for people.
[01:13:33.728 --> 01:13:37.729]  But no, the government would rather regulate it and ship in poison for us.
[01:13:37.809 --> 01:13:38.369]  Why is that?
[01:13:40.316 --> 01:13:41.297]  It's unconscionable.
[01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:43.079]  I don't understand it.
[01:13:43.179 --> 01:13:44.560]  But we can fight back.
[01:13:45.301 --> 01:13:46.322]  We can fight back.
[01:13:46.382 --> 01:13:52.788]  There is an organization called Farm to Consumer Legal Defense Fund who is defending Sharon Palmer.
[01:13:53.329 --> 01:13:58.734]  This organization, along with the Buckeye Institute, is defending the Stowers in Ohio.
[01:13:59.315 --> 01:14:00.696]  And they can use help.
[01:14:01.411 --> 01:14:03.712]  Anyone has a buck or two they can send to these places.
[01:14:03.732 --> 01:14:05.854]  They can use help because we have to fight back.
[01:14:05.874 --> 01:14:07.715]  We've got to push the government back in this thing.
[01:14:08.195 --> 01:14:09.756]  We've got to push the government back.
[01:14:10.036 --> 01:14:15.199]  I want you to give out some websites and phone numbers how people can help because, you know, now is the time.
[01:14:15.239 --> 01:14:17.360]  It's not to wait six months from now when it gets worse.
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:24.024]  It's already as bad as it could possibly get when, again, you have undercover agents going to small Mennonite farms.
[01:14:24.504 --> 01:14:26.565]  You know, I have a large Amish community where I am.
[01:14:26.625 --> 01:14:29.046]  I still go to the farmer's market, even where I live.
[01:14:30.307 --> 01:14:32.729]  Which is about an hour away from where the Amish farmer's market is.
[01:14:32.769 --> 01:14:34.690]  We have a farmer's market every week.
[01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:36.972]  And you can go get fresh produce.
[01:14:37.012 --> 01:14:39.493]  That might not be around six months or a year from now.
[01:14:40.394 --> 01:14:49.780]  Well, the primary agency that's fighting against the government on this is the Farmer to Consumer Legal Defense Fund.
[01:14:50.761 --> 01:14:51.661]  You can Google that.
[01:14:52.142 --> 01:14:54.123]  Find out where to send some money to to help them out.
[01:14:55.264 --> 01:14:58.486]  And we need to contact farmers
[01:14:59.395 --> 01:15:00.575]  On where to buy stuff.
[01:15:00.855 --> 01:15:02.696]  And there's national organizations.
[01:15:02.816 --> 01:15:08.837]  LocalHarvest.com is a clearinghouse for farmers to advertise their stuff on.
[01:15:09.478 --> 01:15:10.938]  RealMilk.com.
[01:15:12.658 --> 01:15:17.419]  Clearinghouse for finding where you get good stuff, good raw milk.
[01:15:17.539 --> 01:15:22.461]  Information about our PICFA organization is info at PICFA.org.
[01:15:22.541 --> 01:15:25.722]  That's the Pennsylvania Independent Consumers and Farmers Association.
[01:15:26.342 --> 01:15:27.582]  We are battling
[01:15:28.462 --> 01:15:33.784]  To get the government out of the consumer-to-farmer relationship.
[01:15:34.224 --> 01:15:39.226]  If I can sell you a tomato or a carrot, I can sell you a quart of milk.
[01:15:39.306 --> 01:15:40.647]  It's my right as a farmer.
[01:15:41.127 --> 01:15:44.548]  If I want to buy it from a farmer, it is my right to go to him to buy.
[01:15:44.568 --> 01:15:51.311]  This thing of having to have permission to do what we've been doing for 10,000 years is totally unconscionable.
[01:15:52.577 --> 01:15:54.258]  Well, it shows the expansion of control.
[01:15:54.278 --> 01:15:57.499]  You know, it shows that they're never, ever, ever satisfied.
[01:15:57.519 --> 01:16:00.941]  They're not even satisfied with selling the majority of the public poison.
[01:16:01.241 --> 01:16:03.742]  They now want to sell all of the public poison.
[01:16:03.922 --> 01:16:09.705]  And why don't you just talk to some of the dangers of these GMO foods and why you should actually go to a farmer's market.
[01:16:09.745 --> 01:16:13.047]  Why you should buy fresh milk and produce from your local farmer.
[01:16:13.787 --> 01:16:20.130]  Well, the GMO things and the stuff that Monsanto has been passing off on the farmers to inject into their cows
[01:16:20.657 --> 01:16:23.237]  So they give more milk at the BHT.
[01:16:24.458 --> 01:16:27.358]  Those things are so, there's so many unknowns.
[01:16:27.398 --> 01:16:40.220]  There is one known thing about the BHT, and that is 10% more women, a woman has at least a 10% higher possibility of getting breast cancer if she drinks milk rather than whether cows have been injected with this Monsanto growth hormone.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:50.162]  And there are very, very clear evidence, there's very clear evidence that the roundup that comes through the grains and the product
[01:16:50.953 --> 01:17:00.596]  That are sprayed with this stuff, comes right on through the finished product, and the poison in the Roundup comes right on through and affects the people who eat it.
[01:17:01.176 --> 01:17:04.657]  The problem with this is, most people are not aware of it.
[01:17:05.137 --> 01:17:11.539]  They just are not aware of it because the news media is squelching information, getting back the BHT.
[01:17:12.259 --> 01:17:20.221]  About a year ago, there's two really good journalists on Fox News put together a documentary
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:28.105]  On this BHT and they were forced to change it, forced to change it, forced to change it because Monsanto was a big advertiser on Fox.
[01:17:28.505 --> 01:17:30.546]  Well, they ended up losing their job.
[01:17:30.986 --> 01:17:33.828]  Never to get the thing published, Monsanto controlled the airwaves.
[01:17:33.988 --> 01:17:35.749]  And that's on, which documentary is that?
[01:17:35.789 --> 01:17:46.376]  I've actually seen that documentary where they were local reporters and they tried to report on it again and again and again and they were eventually let go and then they won a lawsuit against the news agency for wrongfully firing them, correct?
[01:17:47.028 --> 01:17:47.588]  That's correct.
[01:17:47.829 --> 01:17:48.729]  I think that's correct, yeah.
[01:17:48.949 --> 01:17:58.456]  Yeah, no, I'm all, man, I wish I could remember what doc it was, because it was a really good doc and it shows you the control that these, you know, GM, like Monsanto is the devil, folks.
[01:17:58.516 --> 01:18:00.857]  I mean, these guys do not have your best interests at heart.
[01:18:01.098 --> 01:18:11.485]  They're not only about a bottom line, but they're literally about genetically modifying what we eat and put into our bodies and having total and complete control over what goes inside of us.
[01:18:12.205 --> 01:18:13.426]  Have you heard of Steve Hicks' case?
[01:18:13.835 --> 01:18:15.696]  No, no, definitely not.
[01:18:15.836 --> 01:18:25.099]  Steve Hickson, a seat cleaner out in Illinois, his place was broken into, his address book, etc.
[01:18:25.239 --> 01:18:36.103]  was gone through, and I figure he had possibly had a GPS put on his seat cleaning machine that tracked him to every one of the customers.
[01:18:36.504 --> 01:18:42.926]  Now, his customers are being served with papers being sued because Monsanto
[01:18:43.533 --> 01:18:45.755]  Thinks they're using Monsanto's seed.
[01:18:46.275 --> 01:18:48.137]  Probably isn't even the case.
[01:18:48.517 --> 01:18:51.519]  The seed cleaners are being, it's an attempt to put them out of business.
[01:18:51.679 --> 01:18:56.323]  FDA has found seed cleaners to be a source of contamination, which is crap.
[01:18:56.823 --> 01:18:58.985]  Seed cleaners merely clean the seeds, right?
[01:18:59.625 --> 01:19:06.591]  And so FDA is saying, well, we've got to put these guys out of business because they are going to contaminate the seeds with their seed cleaners.
[01:19:06.711 --> 01:19:10.754]  What they're really doing is cleaning the seeds for using next year.
[01:19:10.774 --> 01:19:12.055]  However, with Monsanto,
[01:19:13.223 --> 01:19:19.747]  You gotta buy new seed every year, and you gotta pay them their legal fee every year.
[01:19:20.607 --> 01:19:24.910]  Monsanto is putting people out of business, and the yield doesn't get any better.
[01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:37.738]  Have you heard anything about over in India where these farmers bought this BT cotton seed and it didn't work, and the farmers in India are thousands of them drinking Roundup to kill themselves because the stuff didn't work.
[01:19:38.378 --> 01:19:41.240]  Or rather, the BT cotton just didn't yield like they said it was gonna.
[01:19:41.846 --> 01:19:45.488]  And they're going, they're killing themselves just to get out of there, out of debt.
[01:19:45.828 --> 01:19:46.588]  It's really sad.
[01:19:47.229 --> 01:19:55.093]  That is really sad, but you know, it just shows you a brutal corporation like Codex, I'm sorry, Monsanto, is there to put the little guy out of business.
[01:19:55.113 --> 01:20:02.517]  And when you see Codex Elementarius being pushed and, you know, basically supposed to be pushed by 2012, we may not have a choice what goes in our body.
[01:20:02.737 --> 01:20:06.839]  It's P-I-C-F-A dot org, InfoWars dot com, PrisonPlanet dot com.
[01:20:11.039 --> 01:20:11.419]  I think so.
[01:20:29.731 --> 01:20:30.391]  We're good to go!
[01:20:58.786 --> 01:21:03.287]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:21:03.327 --> 01:21:04.808]  And we knew what to do.
[01:21:04.908 --> 01:21:05.948]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:21:05.968 --> 01:21:11.590]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:21:28.323 --> 01:21:35.307]  EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:21:35.647 --> 01:21:42.451]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:21:42.751 --> 01:21:45.813]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:21:45.913 --> 01:21:51.156]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:21:51.697 --> 01:21:54.218]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:21:54.753 --> 01:22:00.617]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[01:22:00.797 --> 01:22:03.359]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:22:03.719 --> 01:22:08.662]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:22:10.928 --> 01:22:14.771]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:22:14.811 --> 01:22:16.052]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:22:16.212 --> 01:22:19.794]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:22:20.094 --> 01:22:22.596]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[01:22:23.016 --> 01:22:24.758]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:22:25.078 --> 01:22:27.399]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:38.889]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:22:40.570 --> 01:22:42.872]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:22:42.932 --> 01:22:46.014]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[01:22:46.214 --> 01:22:48.636]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-BILLION.

[01:23:09.966 --> 01:23:11.468]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:23:11.668 --> 01:23:13.110]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:23:13.410 --> 01:23:15.653]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:23:16.093 --> 01:23:20.839]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:23:21.239 --> 01:23:24.062]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:23:24.423 --> 01:23:27.927]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[01:23:28.317 --> 01:23:40.300]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:42.861]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[01:23:42.881 --> 01:23:44.181]  I use one every day.
[01:23:44.601 --> 01:23:47.042]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:23:47.302 --> 01:23:48.043]  We're good to go.
[01:24:24.102 --> 01:24:52.475]  Legalize it Don't pasteurize it Don't homogenize it Just legalize it It's a long-standing tradition And it's great in the kitchen Part of a healthy diet Everyone should buy it
[01:24:54.272 --> 01:25:18.881]  It sustained our ancestors Must not be sequestered Raw dairy keeps you fed Let's all reap the benefits So legalize it Don't pasteurize it Don't homogenize it Just legalize it
[01:25:24.234 --> 01:25:38.706]  Alright folks, we are back.
[01:25:38.766 --> 01:25:40.508]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:25:40.808 --> 01:25:43.110]  And that's David Eisen with the Real Milk Song.
[01:25:43.951 --> 01:25:50.837]  Hopefully all you people that called in and hated on me for having Metallica on will now forgive me for having
[01:25:51.914 --> 01:25:58.518]  The Real Milk Song and Jonas Stolzfus of the Pennsylvania Independent Consumer and Farmers Association.
[01:25:58.718 --> 01:26:01.620]  That's P-I-C-F-A dot org.
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:08.664]  And, you know, these guys are on the front lines for trying to get you non-GMO fresh foods.
[01:26:09.184 --> 01:26:10.145]  You know, not only milk.
[01:26:11.152 --> 01:26:12.933]  Not only cheese, but produce as well.
[01:26:13.474 --> 01:26:21.760]  And it's all under attack from these big corporations and the federal government sending in sting squads, you know, undercover police officers to try to entrap people.
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:26.904]  Like, literally begging to sell a... for a woman farmer to sell a block of cheese.
[01:26:28.385 --> 01:26:29.506]  That's what the feds are up to.
[01:26:30.066 --> 01:26:32.048]  You know, you think that they're fighting terrorism all the time?
[01:26:32.108 --> 01:26:32.228]  No.
[01:26:32.468 --> 01:26:34.129]  They're here to go after the common man.
[01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.950]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:38.753]  I mean, it's just unbelievably... Jonas, how are we going to overcome this?
[01:26:40.011 --> 01:26:40.351]  Dave?
[01:26:41.072 --> 01:26:43.954]  Yeah, I was thinking about my buddy David just got done singing that song for us.
[01:26:45.696 --> 01:26:49.960]  The way we overcome this is to get into action.
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:53.663]  First of all, find a farmer and buy from them.
[01:26:54.503 --> 01:26:55.724]  That way he can survive.
[01:26:56.805 --> 01:26:59.528]  And of course, I gave you a couple of websites on how to find a farmer.
[01:26:59.648 --> 01:27:01.990]  LocalHarvest.com, RealMilk.com.
[01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:06.874]  Go to your local farmer's market, get to know the people, talk to them.
[01:27:07.711 --> 01:27:11.514]  Because there's where you will get food that will help you stay healthy.
[01:27:12.975 --> 01:27:15.897]  A moment ago, you talked about them going after the consumers of this.
[01:27:15.937 --> 01:27:18.059]  They went after somebody's list of customers.
[01:27:18.179 --> 01:27:20.160]  I mean, that is just crazy to me.
[01:27:20.721 --> 01:27:21.922]  And how did this even come about?
[01:27:23.123 --> 01:27:31.429]  Well, in this case, it's Monsanto going after the seed producers and going after the farmers who are keeping their seed and using it over again like they've been doing for centuries.
[01:27:32.049 --> 01:27:35.172]  This is Monsanto attempting to get control
[01:27:35.825 --> 01:27:37.907]  of the seeds and thus the food.
[01:27:39.208 --> 01:27:40.769]  But that's a great, great big thing.
[01:27:40.829 --> 01:27:49.435]  But we can fight back as consumers by demanding that our government labels the food that is made with GMO.
[01:27:49.535 --> 01:27:50.937]  Right now it's about 90%.
[01:27:51.537 --> 01:27:54.239]  But the consumers have a right to know how that food is made.
[01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:55.840]  They have a right to know.
[01:27:56.321 --> 01:28:04.547]  But as consumers wise up and educate themselves as to the health deficiencies that this halfway food
[01:28:05.431 --> 01:28:09.853]  is given us, and this is why we have such a health problem in this country.
[01:28:10.293 --> 01:28:13.735]  We are not eating nutrient-dense food.
[01:28:14.175 --> 01:28:22.419]  The Weston A. Price Foundation has been pushing the idea of eating properly, eating wisely, eating healthy.
[01:28:23.479 --> 01:28:29.182]  There's so much research that proves that this is the right way to go.
[01:28:29.302 --> 01:28:32.963]  Now, some of the problem is with the GMO is that no one's researching it.
[01:28:33.463 --> 01:28:34.724]  We are all guinea pigs.
[01:28:35.724 --> 01:28:38.507]  That's a great way to put it.
[01:28:38.547 --> 01:28:51.401]  We are all guinea pigs for this, and not only that, but we live in such a fast food culture that, you know, sometimes five nights a week these kids are eating McDonald's and Burger King, and then when they send their kids off to school, they're eating Lunchables.
[01:28:51.501 --> 01:28:54.544]  I mean, folks, there's literally almost nothing
[01:28:55.265 --> 01:28:56.326]  There's a pretty much documented fact
[01:29:24.773 --> 01:29:31.479]  That passionate homogenized milk will foster earache in infants and young children.
[01:29:31.959 --> 01:29:34.141]  It makes infants and young children get earache.
[01:29:34.461 --> 01:29:39.606]  Where if you would feed those infants and young children raw milk, then they'd be much healthier.
[01:29:40.426 --> 01:29:43.229]  We had a case of a foster child at our home.
[01:29:44.109 --> 01:29:45.210]  We kept her for about three weeks.
[01:29:45.230 --> 01:29:46.391]  We were going to keep her for about two weeks.
[01:29:46.511 --> 01:29:47.132]  Interim seal.
[01:29:47.967 --> 01:29:52.649]  She came to our home and she screamed 18 hours of every day for about two days.
[01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:54.689]  I told my wife... And that was all due to the milk, Jonas.
[01:29:54.729 --> 01:29:59.351]  Jonas Stolfitz of the Pennsylvania Independent Consumers and Farmers Association.
[01:29:59.811 --> 01:30:01.232]  P-F-I-A-C dot org.
[01:30:01.272 --> 01:30:02.072]  We're on the march.
[01:30:02.572 --> 01:30:04.153]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:04.173 --> 01:30:07.794]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:11.087 --> 01:30:19.476]  There is growing evidence that Americans would have better health and a lower incidence of cancer and fibrocystic disease of the breast if they consumed more iodine.
[01:30:19.556 --> 01:30:30.267]  Neutriodine iodine is formulated to work with your body to help to stimulate proper hormonal balance and can assist in detoxification from fluoride, bromide and chloride toxins.
[01:30:30.527 --> 01:30:34.550]  And helps provide protection from radioactive iodine from nuclear fallout.
[01:30:34.690 --> 01:30:39.533]  Nutriodine is made with a proprietary high energy field from pure crystalline iodine.
[01:30:39.613 --> 01:30:42.614]  Nutriodine should be used by all ages every day.
[01:30:42.775 --> 01:30:46.577]  If you suffer from chronic fatigue, low thyroid, and mitochondria function.
[01:30:46.657 --> 01:30:48.898]  Or if you just want to feel better from day to day.
[01:30:49.038 --> 01:30:50.919]  Nutriodine drops are for you.
[01:30:50.979 --> 01:30:52.741]  There are several forms of iodine.
[01:30:52.841 --> 01:30:55.122]  Nutriodine is the only trusted source.

[01:31:11.335 --> 01:31:17.720]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:19.762]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:20.917 --> 01:31:21.757]  Who is the enemy?
[01:31:22.278 --> 01:31:22.778]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:23.078 --> 01:31:24.058]  This is his M.O.
[01:31:24.078 --> 01:31:25.359]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:25.439 --> 01:31:27.099]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:27.439 --> 01:31:34.182]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:34.582 --> 01:31:35.022]  Some U.S.
[01:31:35.062 --> 01:31:40.704]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:41.424 --> 01:31:44.905]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:44.925 --> 01:31:47.706]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:21.509]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:23.051]  Garden in a Can!

[01:33:17.213 --> 01:33:19.114]  Alright folks, we are back.
[01:33:19.134 --> 01:33:20.094]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:20.114 --> 01:33:21.515]  I am Jason Burmas, sitting in all week.
[01:33:21.535 --> 01:33:26.597]  We just got done with Jonas Stolzfitz of the Pennsylvania Independent Consumer and Farmers Association.
[01:33:45.555 --> 01:33:46.637]  But that's not the end of the story.
[01:33:46.677 --> 01:33:51.023]  We actually now have Maurice Thompson of the Buckeye Institute.
[01:33:51.943 --> 01:33:53.144]  And they were called to action.
[01:33:54.264 --> 01:34:11.011]  Basically, the Buckeye Institute's 1851 Center for Constitutional Law, today took legal action, that was in December 17th, against the Ohio Department of Agriculture and the Lorain County Health Department for violating the constitutional rights of John and Jacqueline Stowers of Lorain, Ohio.
[01:34:11.271 --> 01:34:15.173]  The Stowers operate an organic food cooperative called Mana Storehouse, biblical reference.
[01:34:16.113 --> 01:34:24.076]  ODA and Lorain County Health Department agents forcefully raided their home and unlawfully seized the family's personal food supply, cell phones, and personal computers.
[01:34:24.096 --> 01:34:32.719]  See, they don't just take your phone, they take your food, they take your phone and your technology, really just like not only crippling your business, but your day-to-day life.
[01:34:32.759 --> 01:34:33.639]  They're really nice people.
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:37.621]  The legal center seeks to halt future similar raids.
[01:34:37.661 --> 01:34:38.141]  I hope so.
[01:34:38.301 --> 01:34:40.742]  I hope that the Buckeye Institute can do that.
[01:34:41.242 --> 01:34:43.083]  The complaint was filed in Lorain County Court.
[01:34:43.963 --> 01:34:48.884]  Of common pleas, the use of these police state tactics on a peaceful family is simply unacceptable.
[01:34:49.624 --> 01:34:59.006]  Buckeye Institute President David Hanson said, officers rushed into the Stowers' home with guns drawn and held the family, including ten young children, captive for six hours.
[01:34:59.246 --> 01:35:02.687]  See, this is a farmhouse family.
[01:35:02.947 --> 01:35:04.847]  I mean, ten kids and they have a farm?
[01:35:05.107 --> 01:35:08.168]  God forbid they feed their kids with the food they grow.
[01:35:09.318 --> 01:35:13.704]  This outrageous case of bureaucratic overreach must be addressed and I couldn't agree more.
[01:35:14.686 --> 01:35:16.148]  Mr. Thompson, thank you for joining us.
[01:35:16.809 --> 01:35:17.069]  You do.
[01:35:18.852 --> 01:35:22.417]  Why don't you first tell people about the organization and then how they can get involved.
[01:35:23.547 --> 01:35:24.027]  Absolutely.
[01:35:24.067 --> 01:35:26.648]  Well, our organization is the Buckeye Institute.
[01:35:26.748 --> 01:35:29.808]  I run the 1851 Center, which is our legal arm.
[01:35:30.308 --> 01:35:52.212]  We litigate constitutional issues that basically implicate people's rights to be left alone by the government, and that comes in a myriad of forms, including lower taxes, less government spending, less government regulation, property rights, and the right to contract issues, like we have here, police state-type issues.
[01:35:53.948 --> 01:36:04.835]  The Buckeye Institute itself is also a think tank, so it writes policy papers and argues for limited government across multiple areas.
[01:36:05.176 --> 01:36:08.878]  Also, education reform is an important issue we focus on.
[01:36:09.899 --> 01:36:15.443]  The best way to get involved is probably to go to our website, which is www.buckeyeinstitute.org.
[01:36:15.996 --> 01:36:16.457]  We're good.
[01:36:35.501 --> 01:36:47.638]  And there they'll also be able to view our legal filings in the case, and follow the case as it proceeds through the courts, and also our press release, which gives a nice, much shorter description, and is much easier to read than the legal filings themselves.
[01:36:48.442 --> 01:36:51.744]  Yeah, it's absolute insanity that they raid a family of twelve.
[01:36:51.824 --> 01:37:03.412]  I mean, you know, the adults, the ten kids, they hold them hostage for six hours, they take not only their food supply, you know, but the food supply they're going to live off, basically their way of living, and then that's not enough.
[01:37:03.432 --> 01:37:11.617]  You know what, we're going to take your phones and your computers, we're going to see who your customers are and who you're contacting, and they're probably going to run, you know, undercover SWAT teams on them as well.
[01:37:12.353 --> 01:37:20.358]  Well, the one thing that you neglected to mention, your otherwise excellent introduction of the issue, was the reason for this raid.
[01:37:20.999 --> 01:37:37.289]  And I think that a lot of your listeners, I think I've been on the show before, and a lot of your listeners may already be familiar with the issue, but this is a case where a group of police officers show up and engage in SWAT-like tactics, force their way into the house with guns drawn.
[01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:41.432]  The lead officer is an officer of the Violent Fugitive Task Force.
[01:37:42.413 --> 01:37:47.935]  And the family is rounded up and held while multiple agents come in and comb over the entire property.
[01:37:48.835 --> 01:37:50.776]  But the lead-up to that is just as important.
[01:37:50.876 --> 01:37:56.277]  And it's important that your listeners understand what precipitated this raid.
[01:37:56.297 --> 01:38:01.099]  And these people aren't crack dealers.
[01:38:01.299 --> 01:38:03.819]  They're not engaging in any kind of violent crime.
[01:38:04.519 --> 01:38:09.541]  Their crime, in the government's eyes, was doing business without the proper license.
[01:38:10.387 --> 01:38:11.748]  Yeah, and selling a dozen eggs.
[01:38:12.148 --> 01:38:12.909]  A dozen eggs.
[01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:14.791]  That's correct.
[01:38:14.871 --> 01:38:28.162]  That was the only transaction that the government used to justify this raid and to argue that this is a retail food establishment doing business without a retail food establishment license.
[01:38:28.797 --> 01:38:29.838]  That's totally insanity.
[01:38:29.858 --> 01:38:32.039]  I mean, you can go get a dozen eggs for less than two dollars.
[01:38:32.099 --> 01:38:37.901]  Here they are spending thousands of dollars to ruin a family's way of life, really.
[01:38:37.941 --> 01:38:42.323]  I mean, what are these guys supposed to do without their crop, without their food?
[01:38:42.543 --> 01:38:44.164]  They have a family of ten to feed.
[01:38:44.704 --> 01:38:45.625]  I mean, this is just...
[01:38:46.465 --> 01:38:51.149]  It's beyond insanity, and like you said, you know, these aren't crack dealers, this isn't somebody with a meth house.
[01:38:51.489 --> 01:39:00.816]  These are people who are genuinely trying to help other people stay healthy, and doing so in really a constitutional manner, and that's why your institute has taken to the cause.
[01:39:02.017 --> 01:39:03.658]  Well, that's absolutely correct.
[01:39:04.218 --> 01:39:12.204]  To provide a little bit more background, what the Man of Storehouse basically is, is a family-run farm and food co-op.
[01:39:12.985 --> 01:39:14.706]  What the family does
[01:39:15.479 --> 01:39:30.226]  Is that they take orders from their neighbors, other members of the co-op, and it is a private co-op, so this is not a, you know, a Giant Eagle or a Kroger's where anybody can walk in off of the street and purchase food, which is important since there are no arms-length transactions.
[01:39:30.286 --> 01:39:34.127]  Everybody that's a member of the co-op knows exactly where the food comes from.
[01:39:34.288 --> 01:39:44.072]  It comes from local farmers, mostly Amish and Mennonite farmers in this very rural area, and they've sought out the Stowers family in the Manistore house.
[01:39:44.574 --> 01:40:04.264]  Because the Stowers family has connections to farmers who engage in farming practices that all these people have sought after and approve of, namely pesticide-free produce, grass-fed cattle, grass-fed chicken as well, pastured chicken.
[01:40:06.245 --> 01:40:09.547]  So these people have been sought out, and they've freely entered into a contract
[01:40:10.123 --> 01:40:12.563]  with the Stowers for the provision of this food.
[01:40:12.583 --> 01:40:14.364]  What they do is they order in bulk together.
[01:40:14.824 --> 01:40:29.327]  You and I may not be able to either afford or store a 55-gallon drum of wheat or the meat from one entire cow, but if we purchase it together, we can each afford it, and then we can split it up as well and then have a place to store it.
[01:40:29.887 --> 01:40:36.268]  That's the premise of a co-op, and that's exactly what has been going on up with the Manor Storehouse.
[01:40:37.193 --> 01:40:39.695]  Uh, and this is of the most fundamental type of behavior.
[01:40:39.715 --> 01:40:48.020]  This is the kind of behavior that many people engage in in this form and other forms of the country today, and that certainly our grandparents engaged in.
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:56.165]  You know, how many of us don't have a grandparent that maybe drove down the road to buy some local produce from the local farmer at one time or another?
[01:40:56.673 --> 01:41:00.656]  Yeah, my grandfather had his own little, you know, little, it wasn't much of a farm.
[01:41:00.696 --> 01:41:06.740]  I mean, he'd grow his own produce in the back, and it's something we used to do together when I was a small child, and then we'd harvest it together and we'd eat it.
[01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:10.423]  I mean, he used to grow watermelons and cucumbers and carrots.
[01:41:10.443 --> 01:41:18.348]  It was actually a nice thing to do, and then, you know, you actually have food that you can feed your kid or your grandkid with a clean conscience.
[01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:19.269]  God forbid.
[01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:26.074]  Sure, and the government's argument, and this is an argument by many state governments, not just Ohio's these days,
[01:41:26.801 --> 01:41:38.572]  Is that that kind of activity should be licensed and requires a retail food establishment license, which is the same kind of license that a very large commercial grocery store is required to have.
[01:41:39.553 --> 01:41:53.165]  And what this really gets us into, and I think the Alex Jones Show is excellent for always having individuals to discuss federal constitutional law on, but there's a very important conflict here that's going on in the state.
[01:41:53.977 --> 01:42:03.343]  And this is between something called the police power, which is the state's ability to regulate things, and our fundamental constitutional rights.
[01:42:04.324 --> 01:42:14.711]  And these two are conflicting, and courts aren't always making the right call on these issues, and that's one of the reasons the Buckeye Institute's 1851 Center came into existence.
[01:42:16.877 --> 01:42:19.298]  A lot of people may have heard of this term, police power.
[01:42:19.778 --> 01:42:20.859]  What does this really mean, though?
[01:42:20.879 --> 01:42:23.860]  It actually has nothing to do with the police themselves.
[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:30.482]  What this is, is the power that government has to enforce laws against people who injure other people.
[01:42:31.163 --> 01:42:45.068]  In other words, most of us believe in the Lockean social compact theory of government, that we were all free individuals first, and we had rights from God, and that we had inalienable and natural rights from God, and that we came together and formed governments
[01:42:45.859 --> 01:42:49.723]  Only to protect ourselves from injury from others and to protect our property.
[01:42:50.184 --> 01:42:53.187]  That that was the fundamental, original reason for government.
[01:42:53.727 --> 01:43:00.855]  And so, instead of engaging in vigilantism, we delegated to government the authority to enforce these rights on our behalf.
[01:43:01.476 --> 01:43:02.577]  That's the police power.
[01:43:03.037 --> 01:43:05.440]  And that's really the only legitimate power of government.
[01:43:06.331 --> 01:43:16.836]  You know, you juxtapose that with our natural rights, our rights to be free, to use and to acquire property, and for adults to enter into contracts that are voluntary.
[01:43:16.856 --> 01:43:34.125]  And there's no question here that state governments don't have the authority to regulate this type of behavior, and that our fundamental rights are certainly at issue in these kinds of cases, dealing with these kinds of contracts and this type of property.
[01:43:35.055 --> 01:43:51.921]  And this is certainly the type of behavior that the people engaged in at the time the Constitution was founded, which is also important because most states have residual rights clauses that indicate that rights are retained by the people where they're not delegated to government.
[01:43:52.581 --> 01:43:57.663]  And we have one of those at the federal level, it's called the Ninth Amendment, and most states also have those.
[01:43:58.203 --> 01:44:02.204]  What that means is that your constitutional rights aren't just the rights
[01:44:02.765 --> 01:44:04.827]  They're specified in the Constitution.
[01:44:04.847 --> 01:44:13.833]  They include also unenumerated rights that are so infinite that they couldn't all be imagined and put into paper, as James Madison said when he passed the Ninth Amendment.
[01:44:15.194 --> 01:44:19.018]  Absolutely, and you know, this is a grab for more power.
[01:44:19.058 --> 01:44:21.581]  So I want to know, number one, where is this case at?
[01:44:21.641 --> 01:44:23.604]  Obviously, it's a relatively new case, the Stowers.
[01:44:23.624 --> 01:44:25.766]  And then how can people get involved to help this family?
[01:44:25.786 --> 01:44:31.352]  Because I'm sure they're going to need help, not only on the legal end, but if they took all their food, they're probably going to need some financial help as well.
[01:44:31.612 --> 01:44:32.594]  How can people get involved?
[01:44:32.634 --> 01:44:35.257]  How can people help the Buckeye Institute and the Stowers family?
[01:44:36.281 --> 01:44:36.582]  Sure.
[01:44:36.702 --> 01:44:40.406]  Well, first off, your first question was as to the status of the case.
[01:44:40.886 --> 01:44:45.151]  We filed our complaint approximately one month ago, not quite that long ago in fact.
[01:44:45.231 --> 01:44:46.753]  So it is a relatively new case.
[01:44:47.053 --> 01:44:48.715]  The raid was just on December 1st.
[01:44:49.857 --> 01:44:55.283]  And at that time, soon after the raid, the prosecutor, the local prosecutor up there,
[01:44:56.162 --> 01:45:02.424]  Um, got on the media and dumped his chest and indicated he was going to be filing charges against his family.
[01:45:02.944 --> 01:45:07.005]  So we, uh, that, that certainly caught our attention along with the rate itself.
[01:45:07.586 --> 01:45:15.188]  So we, uh, we decided we would beat the prosecutor over the courthouse and go ahead and file a lawsuit against them before they filed anything against our clients.
[01:45:16.288 --> 01:45:18.689]  Um, right now our complaint's been filed.
[01:45:18.909 --> 01:45:20.870]  We're awaiting an answer from the government.
[01:45:21.810 --> 01:45:21.870]  Uh,
[01:45:22.782 --> 01:45:29.185]  From that time, maybe about a month from now, maybe a little longer than that, a preliminary injunction hearing will be held.
[01:45:29.626 --> 01:45:30.826]  And that'll be a full-blown hearing.
[01:45:30.846 --> 01:45:38.250]  We'll have a chance to hear from these officers and from these government agents as to why they did what they did, which should be very interesting.
[01:45:38.690 --> 01:45:46.174]  And at that time, the judge will also have an opportunity to enjoy the behavior
[01:45:46.923 --> 01:45:54.088]  of the government, and to stop them from doing this, at least preliminarily, while the case proceeds over the course of normal channels.
[01:45:55.909 --> 01:46:04.876]  As to what your listeners can do to get involved, I would certainly urge them to speak with the ODA about this matter.
[01:46:04.896 --> 01:46:06.977]  You know, there are a number of bad actors here.
[01:46:07.578 --> 01:46:13.882]  The local health department was certainly a bad actor, and the Lorain County Health Department certainly deserves some flack.
[01:46:14.625 --> 01:46:16.566]  As does the Ohio Department of Agriculture.
[01:46:16.606 --> 01:46:20.547]  They treated this like a drug raid from the outset and a drug investigation.
[01:46:20.587 --> 01:46:21.628]  They surveilled the family.
[01:46:21.648 --> 01:46:25.229]  They went undercover and lied to the family to try to become a member of the co-op.
[01:46:25.949 --> 01:46:36.553]  And ultimately, the Ohio Department of Agriculture agent got those eggs that you mentioned earlier by staying at the family's house for two hours and refusing to leave without them.
[01:46:36.573 --> 01:46:40.214]  And so finally, they just gave him the eggs and he slapped some money down on the table.
[01:46:40.654 --> 01:46:42.195]  And that was the alleged
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:47:10.878]  Retail transaction that you referred to there are a lot of bad actors here that deserve a lot of flack and of course ultimately the governor of Ohio is in control of the Department of Agriculture because it's an executive agency so he deserves some heat as well and it would be good for the court to know that people care about this case because you know there are judges are elected prosecutors are elected and that's the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas that's currently handling it and the sheriff up there is elected so that's important
[01:47:12.469 --> 01:47:17.654]  Perhaps more fundamentally than that, we're always appreciative of donations here at the Buckeye Institute.
[01:47:17.994 --> 01:47:20.197]  The website, again, is buckeyeinstitute.org.
[01:47:20.897 --> 01:47:25.081]  And the more donations we receive, the more cases like this we can handle.
[01:47:25.922 --> 01:47:34.971]  And that's quite important, because these paramilitary-style police raids are on the rise, and they're on the rise even in contexts like this, where there's
[01:47:35.715 --> 01:47:38.237]  Only an administrative infraction at issue.
[01:47:38.977 --> 01:47:47.643]  And we want to head these off to the past before they become nationwide and before they become police's regular way of doing business in this country.
[01:47:48.784 --> 01:47:54.248]  So that will be quite important if you'd like to see us handle more cases like this one.
[01:47:56.309 --> 01:48:00.692]  Other than that, the phone calls are great and the family could also use support.
[01:48:00.812 --> 01:48:04.655]  And if you do donate in your market for the family, we can get that support to them as well.
[01:48:05.792 --> 01:48:06.413]  Absolutely.
[01:48:06.513 --> 01:48:10.176]  So, listeners, you know, this is a case that you do need to get involved in.
[01:48:10.196 --> 01:48:12.638]  Like you said, you want to head these off at the pass.
[01:48:13.178 --> 01:48:20.545]  And, you know, the Buckeye Institute, they're institutes that are few and far between with limited, you know, amount of people on the staff.
[01:48:20.605 --> 01:48:27.470]  I know I'm in an office with a limited amount of people on the staff, and it really is only through your funding that we're able to do more.
[01:48:28.111 --> 01:48:32.775]  And this is something that could probably go on court for a year or two, isn't it?
[01:48:33.757 --> 01:48:45.783]  Well, the way that these things typically work in Ohio, and I think in most states, is that trial court judges are kind of the low man on the totem pole, and they're very risk-averse.
[01:48:45.863 --> 01:48:50.805]  They're very unlikely to make a significant constitutional decision on their own.
[01:48:50.985 --> 01:48:58.529]  So a lot of times, we will win these cases eventually, but you're right, a lot of times we'll win them in the appeals court, or even at the Supreme Court.
[01:48:59.353 --> 01:49:01.734]  Um, we can't always win them at the trial court level.
[01:49:02.134 --> 01:49:09.415]  So it's true, these cases do take a lot, a lot more resources when you're asking the court to find the government's action unconstitutional.
[01:49:09.455 --> 01:49:11.915]  Because, you know, the court ultimately is part of the government, too.
[01:49:12.416 --> 01:49:16.476]  They're highly deferential to the government, more so than they should be under the Constitution.
[01:49:17.537 --> 01:49:25.118]  But they're highly deferential, especially to local governments, um, you know, because those are the people they bump into in the hallway, you know, in the courthouse every day.
[01:49:26.337 --> 01:49:38.309]  Exactly, they all collude with one another and you're right, when you are taking on the establishment, when you're taking on the government, especially at a local level, your chances are not so great at, you know, being able to end the case and end it constitutionally.
[01:49:38.329 --> 01:49:48.659]  You often do have to go to the appeals court or a higher court in order to do so and that takes a lot of funding folks, it takes a lot of time, a lot of patience, and it takes institutes like the Buckeye Institute
[01:49:49.099 --> 01:49:52.721]  To take these on, because most people, you know, most people are in the dark about all this.
[01:49:53.021 --> 01:49:54.801]  They don't even understand why it affects them.
[01:49:54.821 --> 01:50:09.107]  Well, when you can SWAT team an entire family for a dozen eggs, and that family includes ten children, and they treat it like a drug raid, like this guy is, you know, selling ecstasy from his front door, I think there's a huge problem with that.
[01:50:10.128 --> 01:50:12.489]  And that really is the whole story, by the way.
[01:50:12.509 --> 01:50:15.470]  Some of your listeners might be thinking, well, there's more to this.
[01:50:16.350 --> 01:50:17.271]  But there really isn't.
[01:50:18.604 --> 01:50:26.992]  Under the Fourth Amendment, one's home is his castle, and he's entitled to a certain amount of dignity and privacy and respect within that home.
[01:50:28.234 --> 01:50:36.562]  You know, it was the British soldiers showing up at your front door and writing their own search warrants after speaking with you if they didn't like your answers.
[01:50:37.223 --> 01:50:41.427]  It was ultimately one of the events that pushed the colonists here in America over the edge.
[01:50:42.348 --> 01:50:47.492]  And so you can't really, you cannot really put a price on how important these protections are.
[01:50:48.173 --> 01:50:48.613]  Absolutely not.
[01:50:48.673 --> 01:50:52.016]  In this case, the family was not dangerous and they were not going to destroy the evidence.
[01:50:52.757 --> 01:50:56.359]  And we are fighting for that right to protect people's homes.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.922]  Maurice Thompson of the Buckeye Institute, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:50:59.942 --> 01:51:01.704]  We're going to take your calls in the last segment.
[01:51:01.744 --> 01:51:02.925]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:51:03.025 --> 01:51:03.966]  I am Jason Bermas.
[01:51:04.046 --> 01:51:06.027]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:51:11.124 --> 01:51:23.849]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:51:24.269 --> 01:51:31.032]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:51:31.372 --> 01:51:34.953]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:51:35.333 --> 01:51:38.534]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:51:38.735 --> 01:51:46.237]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[01:51:46.637 --> 01:51:51.839]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:51:52.039 --> 01:51:54.940]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the
[01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:55.701]  I'm good.
[01:52:11.059 --> 01:52:14.042]  So you've finally decided you're going to stock up and store food.
[01:52:14.362 --> 01:52:16.483]  But why settle for bland, tasteless food?
[01:52:16.944 --> 01:52:18.005]  Why settle for less?
[01:52:18.365 --> 01:52:19.626]  There is an alternative.
[01:52:19.986 --> 01:52:21.447]  InternetGrocer.net.
[01:52:21.728 --> 01:52:24.870]  Enjoy the most delicious, storable food at amazing prices.
[01:52:25.211 --> 01:52:28.813]  Enjoy creamy, delicious, real cheddar cheese in a can.
[01:52:29.114 --> 01:52:31.916]  Indulge in real canned meats and real canned butter.
[01:52:32.216 --> 01:52:38.983]  Storable meals from InternetGrocer.net will bring such variety and flavor you won't be able to tell you're actually eating storable food.
[01:52:39.183 --> 01:52:41.245]  You can purchase by the can or by the case.
[01:52:41.525 --> 01:52:44.208]  Choose a variety pack or an entire year's worth of food.
[01:52:44.468 --> 01:52:49.593]  InternetGrocer.net has non-hybrid seeds that will produce delicious food for you and your family.
[01:52:49.873 --> 01:52:51.494]  Ensure your food supply for years.
[01:52:51.894 --> 01:52:54.476]  Find out just how delicious storable food can be.
[01:52:54.496 --> 01:52:54.796]  Call 903-356-6443.
[01:52:54.816 --> 01:52:55.077]  That's 903-356-6443.
[01:52:55.117 --> 01:52:55.497]  Open from 9 a.m.
[01:52:55.517 --> 01:52:55.677]  to 6 p.m.
[01:52:55.777 --> 01:52:56.538]  Central Standard Time.
[01:52:56.558 --> 01:52:57.718]  Or shop online at internet-grocer.net.
[01:52:57.738 --> 01:52:58.819]  Again, that's internet-grocer.net.
[01:53:10.894 --> 01:53:14.275]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:53:14.416 --> 01:53:19.618]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:53:19.798 --> 01:53:24.580]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:36.085]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:53:36.485 --> 01:53:42.029]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:53:42.249 --> 01:53:48.334]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:53:48.514 --> 01:53:49.175]  What about you?
[01:53:49.555 --> 01:53:55.600]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.122]  Call the Berkey guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.
[01:54:01.482 --> 01:54:04.423]  That's 1-877-886-3653 or simply click on the banner at GCNlive.com to order online now.
[01:54:28.593 --> 01:54:36.939]  I'm probably going to get calls about that one, too.
[01:54:36.999 --> 01:54:39.361]  Johnny Cash leaving us out in this last segment.
[01:54:39.381 --> 01:54:45.985]  Remember, you can get the entire four hours again over at InfoWars.com right after this broadcast.
[01:54:46.005 --> 01:54:47.907]  We play it on a loop every day.
[01:54:48.547 --> 01:54:50.769]  That means you get us six times a day, folks.
[01:54:50.809 --> 01:54:51.989]  How many people offer that for free?
[01:54:52.009 --> 01:54:52.450]  Not many.
[01:54:53.050 --> 01:55:00.655]  And two hours of video broadcast for the PrisonPlanet.TV subscribers might explain that Metallica song that I played for most of you guys.
[01:55:00.715 --> 01:55:02.276]  I can't believe all the calls we got about it.
[01:55:02.636 --> 01:55:15.644]  But when you're talking about Eugenics, when you're talking about Chemtrails, and you're a platinum-selling band, arguably the biggest band in the world, that's right, Metallica now, yeah, the Rolling Stones, they're gonna die soon, okay?
[01:55:16.144 --> 01:55:17.104]  They're not going to be around forever.
[01:55:17.144 --> 01:55:17.725]  Metallica?
[01:55:17.785 --> 01:55:18.665]  They're going to be around.
[01:55:18.685 --> 01:55:20.886]  They're probably the biggest band in the world.
[01:55:21.406 --> 01:55:26.147]  And when they're having social commentary on chemtrails, I think it's important, especially when they're pro-chemtrails.
[01:55:26.748 --> 01:55:27.928]  That has to be exposed.
[01:55:29.409 --> 01:55:38.352]  I want to remind listeners that Tyranny Crusher 1, that's Tyranny Crusher 1 right there on eBay, is going for around 47 Gs right now.
[01:55:38.412 --> 01:55:40.732]  We need the money to expand.
[01:55:40.752 --> 01:55:42.053]  There's a lot of empty offices here.
[01:55:42.293 --> 01:55:42.673]  Who knows?
[01:55:42.733 --> 01:55:43.373]  Maybe it does well.
[01:55:43.393 --> 01:55:45.094]  Jason Burmess comes down to Austin, Texas.
[01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:47.272]  And, uh, he makes this home.
[01:55:47.292 --> 01:55:49.895]  We'll pump out twice as many movies, folks, I promise you.
[01:55:49.935 --> 01:55:53.639]  If I come down here, either that or I'll die an early death from no sleep at all.
[01:55:55.831 --> 01:55:56.191]  All right.
[01:55:56.752 --> 01:56:02.094]  Remember, Tyranny Crusher 1, if you've got the money out there, I know there are some pretty big celebrities that listen to this show.
[01:56:02.114 --> 01:56:07.077]  I don't know if they stay tuned for me, but if you're listening out there, we could use the scratch over here.
[01:56:07.217 --> 01:56:10.819]  Everything gets put into new offices, new films.
[01:56:10.839 --> 01:56:11.239]  There it is.
[01:56:11.259 --> 01:56:12.300]  There's Tyranny Crusher 1.
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:14.601]  And just the expansion.
[01:56:14.621 --> 01:56:16.782]  I mean, Aaron works so hard here.
[01:56:16.822 --> 01:56:20.524]  Rob works so hard to see them both get the office that they deserve.
[01:56:20.584 --> 01:56:21.044]  It's great.
[01:56:22.783 --> 01:56:25.425]  We've got Jaren here now.
[01:56:25.525 --> 01:56:27.006]  Paul Hartman's been here for a while.
[01:56:27.586 --> 01:56:28.507]  He came in over the summer.
[01:56:28.527 --> 01:56:30.268]  It's just an expanding, great crowd.
[01:56:30.868 --> 01:56:35.912]  And if you want us to expand, you want us to get slicker, you want us to reach more people, we need that support.
[01:56:36.112 --> 01:56:37.993]  And why not own Tyranny Crusher 1?
[01:56:38.193 --> 01:56:39.434]  This is a real piece of history.
[01:56:40.275 --> 01:56:42.576]  Alright, let's go to the last three callers.
[01:56:43.537 --> 01:56:46.539]  You've got less than a minute to make your point, folks.
[01:56:46.839 --> 01:56:48.440]  Carla in Pennsylvania, what's on your mind?
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:55.002]  Um, I just was wondering what happened to your friend that made the first video with you.
[01:56:55.022 --> 01:56:57.523]  Are you talking about Dylan and Cory?
[01:56:57.543 --> 01:56:59.864]  Uh, I think his name's Cory.
[01:56:59.884 --> 01:57:01.625]  Yeah, yeah, they're still around.
[01:57:01.645 --> 01:57:06.287]  You know, uh, Cory's in college right now and Dylan's out in California working on some other project.
[01:57:06.327 --> 01:57:09.968]  I don't know if it's going to be Patriot related, but everybody's still working.
[01:57:09.988 --> 01:57:11.169]  Um, you know, I'm working on...
[01:57:12.122 --> 01:57:15.683]  Now my second film outside of the Loose Change series.
[01:57:15.723 --> 01:57:24.905]  I'm working on Invisible Empire, but you know, I've also put that on hold while I'm down here to work on the Obama film because it's an important film and I love Alex Jones' films.
[01:57:24.925 --> 01:57:26.705]  You know, I got to help out.
[01:57:26.725 --> 01:57:30.066]  Yeah, well, we haven't heard much from them lately, so I was just wondering.
[01:57:30.466 --> 01:57:32.286]  Yeah, no, they're out on the internet.
[01:57:32.306 --> 01:57:33.966]  Go check out MySpace.com.
[01:57:33.986 --> 01:57:34.687]  You can get a hold of them.
[01:57:34.947 --> 01:57:36.047]  I thank you for the call, Carla.
[01:57:36.367 --> 01:57:38.447]  Alright, let's go to Tom in Pennsylvania.
[01:57:38.507 --> 01:57:39.267]  Tom, what's on your mind?
[01:57:40.548 --> 01:57:41.088]  Hello, Jason.
[01:57:41.488 --> 01:57:41.768]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:43.195 --> 01:57:45.617]  I had a comment on the milk thing.
[01:57:46.097 --> 01:57:54.265]  A way for this to be handled other than the co-ops is for the people who are actually going in to get milk to
[01:57:55.051 --> 01:57:57.312]  Buy cows from the guy.
[01:57:57.613 --> 01:57:59.414]  That way you're getting your own milk.
[01:57:59.614 --> 01:58:00.834]  You're not buying milk.
[01:58:00.875 --> 01:58:02.415]  You're not buying unprocessed milk.
[01:58:02.455 --> 01:58:05.777]  You're buying a cow and you're using your own product.
[01:58:05.938 --> 01:58:07.058]  You know, that sounds great, Tom.
[01:58:07.098 --> 01:58:14.363]  Unfortunately, most people do not have a shed to keep that cow, nor a willing son or daughter to go milk that cow in the morning.
[01:58:15.523 --> 01:58:19.545]  I mean, it's a great idea, you know, you live in an apartment that's also going to be a tight squeeze, you and the cow.
[01:58:20.145 --> 01:58:26.388]  I think that, you know, in general we should probably just stop prosecuting farmers for farming and selling us food that's good for us.
[01:58:26.448 --> 01:58:28.009]  That's probably what we should do.
[01:58:28.989 --> 01:58:31.030]  Folks, I want to thank you so much for joining me today.
[01:58:31.050 --> 01:58:32.611]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:32.851 --> 01:58:33.631]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[01:58:33.651 --> 01:58:41.314]  Remember, you can get my films, Fabled Enemies, Loose Change, Final Cut, and Alex's films, Endgame, 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising, over at Infowars.com right now.
[01:58:41.835 --> 01:58:42.335]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
