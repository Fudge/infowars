[00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:08.127]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:08.768 --> 00:00:09.588]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.309]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.512]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.092 --> 00:00:20.194]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.935 --> 00:00:23.076]  Well, we just had Governor Jesse Ventura
[00:00:23.476 --> 00:00:30.503]  Back on, he happened to be with us last Friday, and then Lord Monckton came on, saying that ClimateGate is an absolute fraud, it's all a scam.
[00:00:30.923 --> 00:00:33.986]  He was, a few years ago, on the bandwagon with them.
[00:00:34.446 --> 00:00:36.748]  He was fooled, he's now admitted he was fooled.
[00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:38.250]  He's very angry.
[00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:46.858]  A lot of supporters, well-meaning supporters of this fraud, are now waking up en masse, thanks to the work and the research.
[00:00:48.474 --> 00:00:49.034]  of course.
[00:01:08.146 --> 00:01:10.487]  The UN is calling it the most important summit in history.
[00:01:10.507 --> 00:01:13.348]  YouTube says our future is being decided in Copenhagen.
[00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:14.489]  They're pushing it.
[00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.191]  Lord Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount of Monckton and Brinchley.
[00:01:19.774 --> 00:01:30.420]  Has worked at all levels of government, has been a top journalist, has a scientific organization advising governments and corporations, was one of the chief advisors to Margaret Thatcher.
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.600]  The list goes on and on.
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.201]  He really needs no introduction.
[00:01:33.941 --> 00:01:36.262]  But Lord Monckton, we got a break in three minutes.
[00:01:36.283 --> 00:01:38.324]  We'll come back with plenty of time to break this down.
[00:01:38.404 --> 00:01:43.226]  But first off, the climate gate blew up even bigger than I thought it would.
[00:01:43.246 --> 00:01:44.787]  It is collapsing.
[00:01:44.827 --> 00:01:48.789]  You are now there at the center of these crooks trying to
[00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:58.195]  Well, it's almost as though Climategate hadn't happened, to be honest.
[00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:05.820]  The vast majority of the world's mainstream media have still not really said what's in the Climategate email.
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.544]  They may have mentioned it once or twice, as the BBC have, but they've not given it anything like the coverage it deserves.
[00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:27.418]  Given the magnitude of the draft treaty, which is under consideration here, when I went into the conference yesterday to ask for a copy of the treaty, I went to the UN documentation centre and said, right, I want the current draft of the negotiating text.
[00:02:28.498 --> 00:02:31.140]  And they looked at me as though they were baffled.
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.023]  You know, the librarian there who had stacks of papers behind her in various languages, she just looked as though she'd never heard of it.
[00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:43.955]  So I insisted and it took about 10 minutes and they consulted each other and there were three or four of them arguing over it.
[00:02:44.335 --> 00:02:46.396]  None of them would produce the document.
[00:02:47.097 --> 00:02:55.300]  So I then did a quick interview with a passing TV camera and came back to the attack and I said, look, I know this treaty exists because this is what the conference is all about.
[00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:57.661]  It's discussing a treaty draft.
[00:02:58.402 --> 00:03:00.483]  And they said, oh no, we've got no such thing.
[00:03:00.583 --> 00:03:04.564]  And I said, well, you have and I want it and I'm not going to be put off.
[00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:07.966]  And if I am put off, there will be an international diplomatic incident.
[00:03:08.433 --> 00:03:15.375]  And only then did they produce a stack of papers two inches thick, a thousand pages, most of which was just a complete element.
[00:03:15.415 --> 00:03:24.838]  But right at the bottom of the stack, when I plowed my way through it, I found hidden the draft or the current draft of the treaty.
[00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:31.240]  And once again, they are desperately trying to conceal from everybody here the magnitude
[00:03:31.713 --> 00:03:33.073]  Of what they're attempting to do.
[00:03:33.434 --> 00:03:35.994]  They really are aiming to set up a world government.
[00:03:36.034 --> 00:03:39.235]  They no longer use the word government in the treaty.
[00:03:39.655 --> 00:03:41.136]  I think we've frightened them off that.
[00:03:41.536 --> 00:03:56.140]  But all the institutions of this world government, and the enormous powers it's going to be given over free markets, to tax the American economy to the extent of 2% of GDP, to impose a further tax of 2% on every financial transaction.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.981]  That could come to a very large percentage of GDP overall.
[00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:02.566]  And to close down, effectively, the West.
[00:04:02.726 --> 00:04:06.247]  Transfer your jobs, if you're listening to this, to third world countries.
[00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:16.871]  All of that is still in the treaty draft, even after all the negotiating rounds, even after the fuss that we've all made to try to make them rethink, and even after climate change.
[00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:33.579]  Well, this is just devastating information, so this appears to be breaking news because I've been doing searches every hour for the latest draft text and the media was saying it wasn't released.
[00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:36.722]  There was this Danish text dealing with the
[00:04:38.263 --> 00:04:41.185]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to tpr20info.com.

[00:05:59.315 --> 00:06:01.516]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:06:02.076 --> 00:06:04.958]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:15.283]  We have the fraudulent ClimateGate emails from the head UN-affiliated climate center in East Anglia.
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:24.507]  We have the fake hockey stick, the lies about the Arctic completely melting, the lies about polar bears and penguins can't swim.
[00:06:25.007 --> 00:06:31.253]  I'm seeing billboards all over Copenhagen saying, save the polar bears, they're going to die.
[00:06:31.293 --> 00:06:32.114]  Complete fraud.
[00:06:32.695 --> 00:06:35.777]  Big billboards of little girls saying, please don't let me drown.
[00:06:36.118 --> 00:06:38.180]  The most base, mindless,
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.522]  Fraudulent information.
[00:06:40.602 --> 00:06:50.110]  Holdren saying 13 foot sea levels when the UN themselves says what 7 to 21 inches and then that itself based on a fraud.
[00:06:50.851 --> 00:06:55.875]  We have now Lord Christopher Monckton because he is a member of the House of Lords went in
[00:06:56.636 --> 00:06:56.816]  I think?
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.124]  So just that's got the third world now reeling, threatening to back out.
[00:07:20.164 --> 00:07:21.946]  The Saudis are calling for investigations.
[00:07:22.326 --> 00:07:23.367]  So much is happening.
[00:07:23.648 --> 00:07:30.014]  I'm going to attempt to go over all of this in the next 51 minutes with Lord Christopher Monckton, again, graciously joining us.
[00:07:30.294 --> 00:07:34.117]  So I'm going to try to just sit back, sir, and let you chronicle.
[00:07:34.157 --> 00:07:36.279]  You're there at Copenhagen.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:47.312]  But also the good news, UN climate chief does say hacked emails are damaging, but as you said, they're like the cat caught with a canary in its mouth, going on about its business like it's no big deal.
[00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:52.078]  They're trying very very hard to pretend that climate change didn't happen.
[00:07:53.323 --> 00:08:00.510]  People who've come to the conference don't really know that it happened because most of the mainstream media have still really not said what's in these emails.
[00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:07.557]  And what is happening is that the mainstream media have done themselves terrible damage by signing up to this climate nonsense.
[00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:17.980]  And then by firmly refusing to admit that Climategate was happening, admit how serious it was, and simply inform their readers of what was actually in these emails.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:30.332]  Admissions that while they're telling us, as the Met Office did just today, that today is the warmest decade since records began 150 years ago, privately what they're saying in the emails, the Climategate emails, is, hey look,
[00:08:30.632 --> 00:08:37.253]  We've got a temperature which in fact has been falling, and we can't explain why, and it's a travesty that we can't explain why.
[00:08:37.473 --> 00:08:44.715]  So they're saying one thing to us publicly, to maintain the scare, making them rich, and that's what's called fraud, it's criminal fraud.
[00:08:44.975 --> 00:08:51.236]  And on the other hand, they're saying privately, oh dear, oh dear, we can't account for the fact there's been no warming for the last 15 years.
[00:08:51.256 --> 00:09:00.298]  I mean, that is, it's very serious, this disconnect between what they're saying among themselves privately, and what they're admitting to us publicly.
[00:09:03.374 --> 00:09:04.135]  Absolutely.
[00:09:06.197 --> 00:09:20.129]  Talking about criminal investigations, Lord Monckton, we have Senator Inhofe calling for it, the Saudis calling for investigations, and the Saudis have pointed out the United Nations, the progenitor of this fraud, they can't run the investigation.
[00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:28.617]  No, they can't, because the United Nations is thoroughly compromised in all this, because the climate panel that it created via the United Nations
[00:09:29.107 --> 00:09:29.728]  Thank you very much.
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:50.881]  We're good to go.
[00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.891]  It's a very, very serious matter and there's no way the UN can be allowed to do this.
[00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:20.693]  I think this has got to go to district attorneys in the United States and it's got to go to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service in the United Kingdom.
[00:10:20.933 --> 00:10:33.736]  It's already gone to the Information Commissioner because there are plain admissions in emails there over the years that they have been planning to avoid disclosing information to other scientists, which is contrary to the scientific
[00:10:34.296 --> 00:10:36.938]  That email clearly constitutes a serious criminal offence.
[00:11:03.971 --> 00:11:10.136]  For which the highest possible level of financial penalty is allowed for by the Freedom of Information Act 2000.
[00:11:10.856 --> 00:11:16.941]  And the person who wrote that email, whom I won't name on the air because it's not fair to him, he is now going to face criminal charges.
[00:11:18.002 --> 00:11:25.988]  He is, I think, going to be indicted, convicted, and he won't be imprisoned because we don't imprison people yet for these offences.
[00:11:26.028 --> 00:11:27.990]  I think the law's going to have to change in the light of this.
[00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.072]  But he will certainly be subjected, as will his institution.
[00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:42.243]  Well, you're a member of the House of Lords, the upper chamber of your parliament, for those that don't know, Lord Christopher Monckton.
[00:11:42.584 --> 00:11:48.992]  Are you saying that the inside information that you're getting from government is that he will be prosecuted?
[00:11:49.881 --> 00:11:58.066]  No, because the government would be most improper if it were to involve itself anyway in whether or not to prosecute somebody.
[00:11:58.126 --> 00:12:04.529]  That is a function entirely of the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is an official who has to be independent of government.
[00:12:04.789 --> 00:12:09.492]  And also, I myself, although a member of the House of Lords, do not have the right to sit or vote.
[00:12:10.152 --> 00:12:16.456]  No, no, I understand, but I'm saying you're saying you believe he will be charged?
[00:12:18.077 --> 00:12:20.539]  I think it is certain that he will be charged.
[00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:36.068]  I myself, together with Professor Fred Stinger, who founded the US Satellite Weather Service many years ago, have written an official complaint to the Information Commissioner asking him to look into this, as has one of the people who had made a frequent information request.
[00:12:36.449 --> 00:12:38.330]  Now, the person who made that information request
[00:12:38.792 --> 00:12:39.715]  Has been answered.
[00:12:39.795 --> 00:12:41.279]  We have not yet been answered.
[00:12:41.796 --> 00:12:53.684]  And if I don't get an answer in the next few days, and as soon as I get back from this COVID-19 Conference, I will be arranging for questions to be put down in the House of Lords about why the Information Commissioner isn't doing his job and replying to his correspondents.
[00:13:12.656 --> 00:13:13.757]  It's worse than that.
[00:13:13.997 --> 00:13:32.064]  It's also against every rule of science, because the only way science can work is if people who publish results on which the largest tax increase and the largest abandonment of freedom ever conceived is about to be negotiated here at Copenhagen.
[00:13:32.444 --> 00:13:41.268]  They have not been sharing their results and their computer programs and their data with other scientists so that those other scientists can check them.
[00:13:42.009 --> 00:14:02.535]  All of this has been done behind closed doors so that they could get away with what turns out to be not just an information offense, but also a very serious scientific and financial criminal fraud for which a very long sentence in prison is the appropriate remedy.
[00:14:03.236 --> 00:14:10.998]  And what I have had is requests from two immensely senior professors, one in the United States and one in Canada,
[00:14:11.516 --> 00:14:16.821]  But I should draft for them complaints to the British police because they don't know how we do it here.
[00:14:16.841 --> 00:14:18.322]  They want me to do that for them.
[00:14:18.602 --> 00:14:20.744]  They will make sure that I've got all the facts correct.
[00:14:20.784 --> 00:14:28.470]  They've both sent me a large amount of information about the facts in their case because they're named in these emails in the most uncomplimentary way.
[00:14:28.731 --> 00:14:39.800]  And it's very clear that a plot to devalue their scientific research by unfair and foul and dishonest means had been engaged
[00:14:40.376 --> 00:14:44.178]  By the conspirators who have been talking to each other in these emails.
[00:14:44.678 --> 00:14:55.242]  So I will be going to see the police superintendent in the East Anglia Constabulary who is heading up the investigation into who the whistleblower is and whether he should be prosecuted.
[00:14:55.322 --> 00:15:05.867]  I can tell you from now he won't be prosecuted because we have legislation which allows whistleblowers to bring criminal offences to the attention of the public in this way without suffering any penalty themselves.
[00:15:06.431 --> 00:15:08.692]  So the whistleblower will not be prosecuted.
[00:15:08.932 --> 00:15:31.398]  However, I will be saying to the police officer that there is clear and systematic evidence of deliberate wide-scale fraud right across the meteorological community in NASA, in NOAA, in the University of East Anglia, in Penn State University, in universities and institutions of learning right across the world.
[00:15:32.065 --> 00:15:39.800]  We're a small coterie of malevolent scientists and they come across as very nasty people in the way they write about everybody else for this reason.
[00:15:40.502 --> 00:15:41.424]  They're very nasty.
[00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:05.068]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:16:05.208 --> 00:16:09.614]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:16:09.734 --> 00:16:11.577]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:16:12.017 --> 00:16:13.359]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:14.681]  There is a solution.
[00:16:14.901 --> 00:16:22.907]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:16:59.858 --> 00:17:04.101]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:17:04.401 --> 00:17:05.021]  Number one.
[00:17:05.321 --> 00:17:08.483]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:17:08.744 --> 00:17:09.304]  Number two.
[00:17:09.604 --> 00:17:14.147]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:17:14.507 --> 00:17:14.948]  It's true.
[00:17:15.248 --> 00:17:19.811]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:17:20.111 --> 00:17:20.671]  Number three.
[00:17:20.931 --> 00:17:24.233]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:17:24.534 --> 00:17:28.236]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:17:28.436 --> 00:17:28.977]  Number 4.
[00:17:29.217 --> 00:17:31.580]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.364]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:17:35.664 --> 00:17:35.884]  Number 5.
[00:17:36.465 --> 00:17:40.389]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:45.375]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:17:45.655 --> 00:17:49.679]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:51.400]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:17:51.621 --> 00:17:53.703]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:17:53.863 --> 00:17:56.205]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:18:00.319 --> 00:18:02.920]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:08.282]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:18:08.663 --> 00:18:10.383]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:18:10.703 --> 00:18:15.526]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:18:15.706 --> 00:18:16.666]  How much do you want?
[00:18:16.886 --> 00:18:17.626]  When do you want it?
[00:18:18.007 --> 00:18:19.607]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:18:19.887 --> 00:18:20.728]  When will you need it?
[00:18:20.968 --> 00:18:23.029]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:24.269]  Will there be any food?
[00:18:24.509 --> 00:18:25.830]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:31.116]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:18:31.296 --> 00:18:34.500]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.385]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:18:38.705 --> 00:18:39.706]  How much will you need?
[00:18:39.946 --> 00:18:40.547]  We don't know.
[00:18:40.847 --> 00:18:41.749]  How much do you want?
[00:18:41.949 --> 00:18:42.690]  All you can get.
[00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:43.691]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:18:43.951 --> 00:18:46.714]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:18:47.015 --> 00:18:49.638]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:18:49.858 --> 00:18:50.659]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:04.505]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:19:04.645 --> 00:19:09.011]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:19:09.171 --> 00:19:11.034]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:19:11.454 --> 00:19:12.816]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:19:13.076 --> 00:19:14.118]  There is a solution.
[00:19:14.338 --> 00:19:22.363]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:19:22.763 --> 00:19:29.848]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[00:19:30.228 --> 00:19:35.892]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health major.
[00:19:36.252 --> 00:19:41.835]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:19:42.275 --> 00:19:46.077]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[00:19:46.417 --> 00:19:53.580]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.

[00:20:00.836 --> 00:20:03.722]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:20:04.443 --> 00:20:07.650]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:15.537 --> 00:20:17.818]  The propaganda looks like it's directed at three-year-olds.
[00:20:18.159 --> 00:20:20.660]  Pictures of children saying, please don't let me drown.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:33.347]  Isn't it important to get these charges rolling while Copenhagen's going on because that will really blow up in the establishment's face and that's why they're panicking because they know they've been engaging in all this crime.
[00:20:33.467 --> 00:20:41.891]  Earlier last week, I'm sure you're aware of this, you're always a few steps ahead of us or more or several leagues ahead of us, it's now coming out that the UN
[00:20:43.072 --> 00:20:51.359]  Of course, there's been a lot of evidence that one of the people who is very prominently named in the emails, indeed one of the people exchanging these emails,
[00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:10.110]  I think so.
[00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:32.500]  The UN said in its 1995 report, and this was what the scientists, around a thousand of them, had signed off on.
[00:21:33.101 --> 00:21:38.689]  What they said was, there is no detectable human influence on global temperature.
[00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:42.175]  We can't find any, we don't know when we will find this.
[00:21:42.671 --> 00:22:00.675]  When I read his reports, his essays, when I look at his documentation, when I see him speak on television or radio, the way he lays it out is so amazing because it's such a huge subject and today he's going right at the fraud and he was finishing up with the fraud and the criminal investigations.
[00:22:01.155 --> 00:22:10.681]  And how it's premeditated fraud to establish a collectivist world government controlled by large financial interests that literally are setting themselves up as emperors of the planet.
[00:22:10.881 --> 00:22:11.941]  And you were finishing up, sir.
[00:22:12.261 --> 00:22:23.408]  But in the time we've got, I then want to get into the fact that you went and demanded and bent the will of these Copenhagen UN bureaucrats to cough up
[00:22:23.988 --> 00:22:30.669]  The latest secret version of the treaty with taxes on money, financial transfers.
[00:22:31.129 --> 00:22:33.050]  I mean, this is off the charts.
[00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:37.331]  Then we've, I want to get your take on the propaganda on the ground there.
[00:22:37.351 --> 00:22:41.271]  I want to get your take on what all the scientists are out there talking about.
[00:22:41.612 --> 00:22:47.093]  How many people will die and starve to death if even a small amount of this is implemented?
[00:22:47.453 --> 00:22:49.853]  What the biofuels has already done.
[00:22:49.873 --> 00:22:52.294]  I mean, this is so monstrous.
[00:22:52.874 --> 00:22:53.634]  Please continue.
[00:22:53.934 --> 00:22:55.735]  Right, where would you like me to start?
[00:22:56.015 --> 00:23:09.402]  Yes, I was just saying that I have these two eminent professors who've asked me to put a case to the police, and as soon as I get back from this conference, I will be going to see the senior police officer, the police superintendent in the East Anglia Constabulary, investigating this matter.
[00:23:09.842 --> 00:23:11.923]  I will be laying their report for him.
[00:23:12.063 --> 00:23:20.628]  I will be asking for a two-hour briefing so that I can brief him on the background to this fraud, because, you know, if you're a police officer, you're not a climatologist.
[00:23:21.184 --> 00:23:21.945]  And it's being announced!
[00:23:48.368 --> 00:23:51.730]  It's being announced to coincide with Copenhagen.
[00:23:52.531 --> 00:23:55.133]  Absolutely, of course it was announced to coincide with Copenhagen.
[00:23:55.553 --> 00:23:59.555]  And this is clear politicking, again, of the worst kind.
[00:23:59.936 --> 00:24:15.466]  But the technical document on which that is based contains a graph lifted from a UN document and not checked, which pretends to suggest that the rate at which global warming is happening has been accelerated.
[00:24:16.053 --> 00:24:20.774]  Over the last 150 years, and particularly in recent years, the last 25 years.
[00:24:21.134 --> 00:24:43.979]  Now that graph is based on a well-known scientific fraud, it's a statistical fraud in fact, called the Endpoint Fallacy, where you take a stochastic data set, that's one where you have to guess which way it's going to jump next, temperature like that, it doesn't follow an ordered curve, it jiggles up and down a lot, and stochastic data sets like that are highly sensitive
[00:24:44.864 --> 00:24:48.405]  Precisely the point at which you start and end your trend line.
[00:24:48.985 --> 00:25:11.393]  And the UN has used this fact to try to convey an entirely false, entirely bogus and fraudulent impression, which has been recited over and over again by ignorant politicians, that the rate of warming is itself accelerating and the EPA, instead of checking independently, as I wrote and told it to do,
[00:25:12.226 --> 00:25:19.893]  Instead, just lifted this material out of the UN's, as we now know, orally-tasted document without bothering to check it.
[00:25:20.193 --> 00:25:28.340]  And guess who was the lead author of the part of the UN document which produced this bogus graph?
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.163]  It was none other than one of the conspirators in the Climategate scandal.
[00:25:32.603 --> 00:25:39.209]  So we can tie all these people together in a series of frauds that now links in the EKA itself.
[00:25:39.750 --> 00:26:03.210]  And because the director of the EPA did not respond, she didn't even answer the submissions that I and many others put in, she herself is now going to be indicted for fraud because she's made herself part of the fraud by being warned that she was relying on documents that were themselves fraudulent, such as this graph, which is plainly fraudulent.
[00:26:03.911 --> 00:26:07.394]  And we know she used it because it's in the technical document that she published.
[00:26:08.035 --> 00:26:18.262]  And instead of withdrawing that, putting in a supplementary document saying that we still believe we're right but we can't rely on that graph anymore, she has done nothing about it.
[00:26:18.322 --> 00:26:27.207]  She has therefore become part of a very serious international scientific and financial fraud and she will have to go and go to jail.
[00:26:28.354 --> 00:26:28.754]  Amazing.
[00:26:28.794 --> 00:26:36.097]  Lord Monckton, is this not, as many researchers and scientists are billing it, the greatest scientific fraud of history?
[00:26:36.137 --> 00:26:44.060]  ClimateGate caught green-handed cold facts about the hot topic of global temperature change after the ClimateGate scandal.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.202]  He joins us from Copenhagen, Denmark.
[00:26:47.242 --> 00:26:49.203]  In extreme demand there, obviously.
[00:26:49.443 --> 00:26:53.524]  We're very fortunate to have him with us here today.
[00:26:55.385 --> 00:26:59.187]  Lord Mocton, again, there's so many subjects to talk about.
[00:26:59.207 --> 00:27:13.055]  I want to get into the leaked treaty that you went and demanded and were able to get the latest leaked information with the Danish techs that has the third world figuring out they're being bamboozled and defrauded by this gaggle of scam artists.
[00:27:13.596 --> 00:27:15.077]  I also wanted to talk to you about
[00:27:15.817 --> 00:27:28.122]  Your ideas for the troops out there to not, you know, get orders from headquarters, but to go to the sound of the guns, what we can do globally to expose and fight this fraud now that we're beginning to rout them.
[00:27:28.363 --> 00:27:29.683]  What about civil suits?
[00:27:30.043 --> 00:27:33.665]  You have all these scientists that were persecuted, that had their papers blocked.
[00:27:34.065 --> 00:27:37.047]  You have these scientific journals that were intimidated.
[00:27:37.388 --> 00:27:42.472]  That right there is a serious civil matter trying to destroy people's careers.
[00:27:42.752 --> 00:27:49.237]  Couldn't civil suits by parties defrauded or taxpayers around the world being defrauded by this lie?
[00:27:49.377 --> 00:27:58.144]  Isn't everyone in the world a plaintiff to sue the United Nations, to sue East Anglia, to sue the EPA, to sue Goddard Climate Center?
[00:27:58.564 --> 00:28:00.686]  I mean, your take on that, Lord Monckton?
[00:28:01.547 --> 00:28:02.988]  Right, I think that, of course,
[00:28:03.539 --> 00:28:09.605]  Anyone has the right to sue, but what you need to do is be very careful to use the proper procedures.
[00:28:09.766 --> 00:28:14.390]  The first thing is that we're dealing here with a criminal rather than a civil matter.
[00:28:14.871 --> 00:28:16.533]  These people have committed crimes.
[00:28:17.013 --> 00:28:19.936]  Serious, imprisonable offenses.
[00:28:19.976 --> 00:28:22.479]  You would call them felonies rather than misdemeanors.
[00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:28.111]  These are crimes for which you can go to prison, and should go to prison if you commit them, for a very, very long time.
[00:28:28.451 --> 00:28:49.415]  Particularly in view of the effect that these crimes are already having on poor people around the world, who are being killed in large numbers by starvation, as a result of policy of Western nations, including the United States, to take, in the case of the United States, one third of its agricultural land out from growing food for people to eat, and into growing totally unnecessary,
[00:29:00.899 --> 00:29:04.900]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.741]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:29:07.881 --> 00:29:09.822]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:29:09.962 --> 00:29:12.103]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:29:12.203 --> 00:29:13.743]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:29:13.863 --> 00:29:18.165]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:29:18.305 --> 00:29:20.687]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:29:20.887 --> 00:29:26.710]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecolablue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.

[00:29:31.694 --> 00:29:34.435]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:29:34.515 --> 00:29:37.157]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:29:37.257 --> 00:29:44.402]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[00:29:44.702 --> 00:29:48.384]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[00:29:48.424 --> 00:29:48.665]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:29:48.685 --> 00:29:50.606]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:30:00.629 --> 00:30:04.871]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[00:30:05.171 --> 00:30:05.791]  Number one.
[00:30:06.091 --> 00:30:09.273]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.513 --> 00:30:10.093]  Number two.
[00:30:10.373 --> 00:30:14.935]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.275 --> 00:30:15.715]  It's true.
[00:30:16.016 --> 00:30:20.578]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.878 --> 00:30:21.338]  Number three.
[00:30:21.698 --> 00:30:24.981]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:25.281 --> 00:30:29.764]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:30.004 --> 00:30:32.366]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.767 --> 00:30:36.149]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:41.153]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.373 --> 00:30:46.137]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.417 --> 00:30:50.459]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:32:02.196 --> 00:32:05.817]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:06.157 --> 00:32:14.298]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:15.038 --> 00:32:19.059]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:19.659 --> 00:32:30.481]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:31.101 --> 00:32:40.104]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:40.624 --> 00:32:45.686]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:46.046 --> 00:32:53.229]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:53.549 --> 00:32:56.290]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:33:00.908 --> 00:33:03.772]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:33:04.493 --> 00:33:07.697]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:11.926 --> 00:33:18.812]  Take Haiti, where they live on mud pies, made with real mud, costing 3 cents each, a pinch of butter, a pinch of salt.
[00:33:19.172 --> 00:33:23.776]  You take the mud, you mash it all up, lay it out in the sun, dry for 6 hours, and sell it to your neighbour for 3 cents.
[00:33:24.316 --> 00:33:27.899]  That's what they're living on, or rather, dying on, in Haiti now.
[00:33:27.979 --> 00:33:38.908]  I was telling this story last year to a conference of government and opposition representatives in Madrid, and a lady in the front row burst into tears, and I said, I'm sorry to offend you, but it is a rather terrible thing that's happened.
[00:33:38.928 --> 00:33:40.790]  She said, I've just come back from Haiti.
[00:33:41.218 --> 00:33:46.242]  Now, because of the doubling of world food prices, they can't even afford the price a month high.
[00:33:46.602 --> 00:33:49.725]  And they're dying of starvation all over the place, she said.
[00:33:50.025 --> 00:33:51.146]  And she was heartbroken.
[00:33:51.386 --> 00:33:57.872]  She said, the reason I'm crying is that you're the first person in the Western world I've ever heard mentioning the plight of the poor.
[00:33:58.332 --> 00:34:00.634]  She said, I'm so grateful, I just can't tell you.
[00:34:01.221 --> 00:34:01.641]  Well, sir...
[00:34:12.910 --> 00:34:24.136]  In the complete financial accounts of the Climate Research Unit, how much grants they've had, and how vastly the amount of grants have increased since they began peddling this scientific knowledge.
[00:34:24.216 --> 00:34:25.556]  And they're working with oil companies!
[00:34:25.656 --> 00:34:36.342]  While people die of starvation in a dozen regions of the world, and there are food riots in those regions too, hardly ever reported in any major Western news medium.
[00:34:36.622 --> 00:34:38.763]  It is a scandal of the worst proportion.
[00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:41.004]  Our own fellow creatures,
[00:34:41.616 --> 00:34:49.639]  are being killed by starvation because these people have lied and made up the science and hidden it so that nobody else could check.
[00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:50.399]  Sir?
[00:34:50.439 --> 00:34:51.840]  It doesn't get worse than that.
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:35:09.247]  Going back to the question I forgot to repose at the start of the break, is this the greatest scientific fraud in history, A, and then B, we also now have in the emails where they're meeting with Dutch Royal Shell, with BP, with Siemens, and others saying, oh, they're...
[00:35:09.727 --> 00:35:11.488]  Right, let's start with that first question.
[00:35:11.548 --> 00:35:16.631]  It follows from my last answer that a fraud on an international scale, which has already killed millions by starvation
[00:35:36.833 --> 00:35:39.814]  The oil companies and other major corporations feverishly working with the climate scammers.
[00:35:39.834 --> 00:35:40.154]  That's right.
[00:35:40.174 --> 00:35:44.035]  This is because they've become so frightened of the United Front
[00:36:06.195 --> 00:36:12.018]  That the world's governing class has put up, saying we are going to peddle this climate nonsense regardless of whether it's true.
[00:36:12.678 --> 00:36:21.983]  That they've decided, I think cravenly, and I've told many of them so, that they'd better just give in and belong with it and try and make as much money as they can out of it.
[00:36:22.503 --> 00:36:24.844]  I think it's disgraceful and I think they're shareholders.
[00:36:24.864 --> 00:36:26.325]  There, there is a case for civil suit.
[00:36:26.745 --> 00:36:33.869]  Shareholders of companies who have done deals of this kind with the fraudsters of the UN and among the politicians and among the scientists.
[00:36:34.269 --> 00:36:35.810]  They do deserve to be sued.
[00:36:36.266 --> 00:36:43.549]  By their shareholders for not protecting the best interests of shareholders and every director of a major corporation is required by law to do.
[00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:46.871]  So I think that is indeed a disgrace.
[00:36:47.571 --> 00:36:51.673]  But what I'd like to do, if I may, is to turn to what is in this draft treaty.
[00:36:51.693 --> 00:36:52.153]  Yes, yes.
[00:36:52.173 --> 00:36:54.874]  About the amount of money that they want to take from you.
[00:36:55.214 --> 00:36:56.235]  And, sir, let me stop you.
[00:36:56.335 --> 00:36:57.195]  Let me stop you briefly.
[00:36:57.215 --> 00:37:06.940]  For those that don't know, and I've been searching every hour and checking during the breaks, you are the only person, and you first, several months ago, ferreted out the secret draft.
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:09.721]  Perhaps you can remind us how you were able to get that.
[00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:15.984]  And then... That's a friend of mine called Willie Shute at the Harvard Smithsonian Institute for Astrophysics.
[00:37:16.468 --> 00:37:22.872]  Who reads everything, bless him, even that which is produced by the forces of darkness in this matter.
[00:37:23.152 --> 00:37:25.734]  And he got onto the U.N., a very obscure U.N.
[00:37:25.754 --> 00:37:30.837]  website, the website of the Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties.
[00:37:31.757 --> 00:37:39.462]  And he found what said it was a note by the Secretariat, but he noticed it was a much too large file just to be a note.
[00:37:40.421 --> 00:37:45.606]  So he looked at the file, and it was a two-page note, but attached to it was 186 pages.
[00:37:45.986 --> 00:37:50.070]  And that was the first draft of the Treaty of Copenhagen.
[00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:53.073]  The title of the file did not say Treaty of Copenhagen.
[00:37:53.213 --> 00:37:55.095]  There was nothing to indicate what this was.
[00:37:55.355 --> 00:38:01.381]  And had he not been diligent in reading everything, spotting the size of the file, neither he nor anybody would ever have found it.
[00:38:01.501 --> 00:38:05.485]  And they would have been able to say, if we had subsequently said, oh, but we had no idea,
[00:38:10.408 --> 00:38:11.008]  Okay.
[00:38:12.068 --> 00:38:18.309]  Okay, now that said, again, recap.
[00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.170]  This is breaking here on air.
[00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:22.430]  You have the latest version.
[00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:25.951]  You're going to go over what's in it for everybody right now.
[00:38:26.731 --> 00:38:29.192]  This is breaking information right now.
[00:38:29.272 --> 00:38:30.692]  Lord Monckton, you have the floor.
[00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:37.554]  Now what I'm going to do is to give you just that bit of the treaty which talks of part of the financial arrangement.
[00:38:37.935 --> 00:38:42.218]  I have never seen a treaty as expensive as this one for the West.
[00:38:42.258 --> 00:38:43.999]  It's only the West that's going to pay.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:49.783]  All the third world countries have been bought so they will sign the treaty because they think they're going to get money out of it.
[00:38:50.084 --> 00:38:52.245]  But it's going to cost the West a fortune.
[00:38:52.666 --> 00:38:53.706]  Here's what it says.
[00:38:54.207 --> 00:38:55.928]  Developed country parties.
[00:38:56.328 --> 00:39:00.031]  That's what they call countries like the United States for instance.
[00:39:00.501 --> 00:39:07.926]  are going to have to pay a tax of anything up to 2% of gross national product.
[00:39:07.946 --> 00:39:12.389]  To give you an idea of how big that is, Britain, that's half the best defence budget.
[00:39:12.749 --> 00:39:19.073]  That's how much they are going to confiscate to fund this vast new government that they're setting up.
[00:39:19.133 --> 00:39:25.957]  I haven't yet counted how many interlocked new bureaucracies there are to constitute this government, but I think it's around 700.
[00:39:26.818 --> 00:39:28.739]  I'm going to try and do a more exact count later.
[00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:34.734]  Then they're going to be levied on their greenhouse gas emissions.
[00:39:35.335 --> 00:39:39.099]  They're going to auction allowances to emit greenhouse gases.
[00:39:39.119 --> 00:39:43.163]  And if you don't buy an allowance to emit greenhouse gases, you won't be allowed to emit them.
[00:39:43.443 --> 00:39:52.212]  You could find that your local electricity company has to shut down because it can't afford to buy the right to emit this harmless gas into the atmosphere.
[00:39:52.652 --> 00:40:02.498]  There's also going to be a uniform global levy of $2 per tonne of CO2 for all fossil fuel emissions.
[00:40:03.658 --> 00:40:04.959]  So that is really enormous.
[00:40:05.199 --> 00:40:19.467]  There are going to be levies on emissions from international aviation, specifically an international air passenger adaptation levy stroke green levy on every airfare, except on journeys that go in or out of poorer countries, of course.
[00:40:20.147 --> 00:40:21.008]  There's going to be
[00:40:22.131 --> 00:40:30.834]  A 2% share of the proceeds on various kinds of UN doggles towards giving money to third world countries.
[00:40:30.854 --> 00:40:32.995]  They're going to tax the money they're going to hand out.
[00:40:33.535 --> 00:40:38.777]  There's also going to be a global levy on international monetary transactions.
[00:40:38.817 --> 00:40:39.817]  That means everything
[00:40:40.239 --> 00:40:43.462]  Transfer of money across borders will be taxed.
[00:40:43.582 --> 00:40:49.406]  They no longer say, as they did in the original draft, what rate that tax was at, but they keep in mind 2%.
[00:40:49.486 --> 00:40:53.249]  That's on top of the 2% tax of GDP that they're going to charge anyway.
[00:40:53.730 --> 00:41:06.700]  There's also going to be, get this, penalties or fines for non-compliance of developed country parties, that's the United States, etc., with their emission reduction and financial resources commitments.
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:08.522]  That means if you don't cut
[00:41:09.099 --> 00:41:11.721]  Your economy down to size and cut your carbon emissions.
[00:41:12.321 --> 00:41:28.812]  Or if you don't pay the vast amounts of money that I've just read out for these various categories, which admittedly some of them are listed as options, but nevertheless we're looking at very, very serious amounts of money here, then there will be a police force effectively.
[00:41:29.172 --> 00:41:34.095]  This government will have the right for the first time ever in an international organisation
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:35.721]  A total global government takeover.
[00:41:35.781 --> 00:41:36.642]  Global government, sir.
[00:41:36.662 --> 00:41:38.243]  Is this total global government?
[00:42:03.052 --> 00:42:07.253]  This is total global government, but on a scale which is simply unimaginable.
[00:42:07.273 --> 00:42:20.776]  I mean, the cost of all these extra boards and panels and technology funds and this and that, that's going to come out of general taxpayers' money over and above the various individual financial provisions I've just read out.
[00:42:21.176 --> 00:42:26.777]  We're looking at a grab for absolute power and absolute financial control worldwide.
[00:42:27.197 --> 00:42:29.418]  And global authorities over-travel?
[00:42:29.458 --> 00:42:30.799]  Tracking where everybody goes?
[00:43:01.405 --> 00:43:05.048]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:43:05.068 --> 00:43:08.431]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:43:08.671 --> 00:43:13.455]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:43:13.475 --> 00:43:19.701]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:43:19.861 --> 00:43:22.103]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:43:22.603 --> 00:43:22.923]  Tim Geithner?
[00:43:22.943 --> 00:43:23.364]  Bernanke?
[00:43:23.444 --> 00:43:24.084]  They're arsonists!
[00:43:24.124 --> 00:43:25.385]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:43:25.405 --> 00:43:27.647]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:43:41.536 --> 00:43:48.525]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:43:48.825 --> 00:43:57.937]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:44:00.646 --> 00:44:03.247]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:44:03.647 --> 00:44:08.609]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:44:08.969 --> 00:44:10.710]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:15.832]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:44:16.012 --> 00:44:16.993]  How much do you want?
[00:44:17.213 --> 00:44:17.953]  When do you want it?
[00:44:18.333 --> 00:44:19.934]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:44:20.214 --> 00:44:21.034]  When will you need it?
[00:44:21.294 --> 00:44:23.355]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:44:23.495 --> 00:44:24.596]  Will there be any food?
[00:44:24.836 --> 00:44:26.176]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:44:26.357 --> 00:44:27.417]  If there's a quarantine,
[00:44:27.557 --> 00:44:28.738]  And you can't feed yourself?
[00:44:28.898 --> 00:44:31.420]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.822]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:44:35.202 --> 00:44:38.704]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:44:39.025 --> 00:44:40.005]  How much will you need?
[00:44:40.245 --> 00:44:40.866]  We don't know.
[00:44:41.146 --> 00:44:42.067]  How much do you want?
[00:44:42.267 --> 00:44:42.987]  All you can get.
[00:44:43.187 --> 00:44:44.028]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:44:44.288 --> 00:44:47.050]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:47.710]  Call 1-800-409-5633.

[00:44:49.532 --> 00:44:50.552]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:44:57.917 --> 00:45:06.521]  5, 6, 3, 3.
[00:44:59.678 --> 00:45:06.521]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:45:06.661 --> 00:45:08.602]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:45:08.742 --> 00:45:10.883]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:45:10.983 --> 00:45:12.503]  And it's available right now to you.

[00:46:01.088 --> 00:46:04.231]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.
[00:46:06.303 --> 00:46:18.393]  If you or a loved one suffer pain or take prescription drugs for pain, then you need to visit TPR20info.com and get TPR20, the effective pain relief cream, without the harmful side effects of prescription drugs.

[00:47:00.942 --> 00:47:03.810]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:47:04.533 --> 00:47:07.742]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:12.166 --> 00:47:38.457]  Expanding on that, now we have the Danish leaked memo that they've been passing around, and I have that draft here, and it talks about, this is even upsetting some of the UN bureaucrats in the third world countries, that the power will be held by the IMF, the World Bank, and other quasi-private organizations, so we have a private corporate structure directly looting the population.
[00:47:38.798 --> 00:47:39.458]  Why is this
[00:47:40.298 --> 00:47:46.400]  Horrifying the third world toadies that have since been taken over by the IMF and World Bank.
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:59.464]  They want the UN to run everything because the UN they now see as simply a sort of socialist cash generating machine, a cash cow for third world countries.
[00:47:59.724 --> 00:48:06.706]  The UN no longer serves any purpose except first its own enrichment and then a little bit of trickle-down.
[00:48:07.336 --> 00:48:10.318]  After it's spent all that it wants on its own vast bureaucracies.
[00:48:10.358 --> 00:48:12.138]  And you know there are 200 of those already.
[00:48:12.459 --> 00:48:15.020]  At least 200 represented here at this conference.
[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:15.860]  Unbelievable.
[00:48:16.841 --> 00:48:23.784]  Alphabet soup of acronyms for these different, you know, UNEPs and WMOs and WFFs and this and that.
[00:48:24.605 --> 00:48:25.405]  Hundreds of them.
[00:48:25.825 --> 00:48:36.851]  And all of that being paid for almost entirely by the taxpayers of the West and occasionally letting some money trickle down to third world countries whose leaders therefore want to get this money for their own
[00:48:37.304 --> 00:48:38.085]  We're good to go.
[00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:13.674]  The reason why the third world countries are annoyed about this is because it isn't their friend the UN that will be running things.
[00:49:13.974 --> 00:49:18.597]  It's the much stiffer, much more business-like World Bank and IMF.
[00:49:18.993 --> 00:49:39.777]  Now, of course, the trouble is that from the point of view of Western countries, whether it's the UN or the World Bank and the IMF that's running this world government, one astonishing characteristic, and I've looked right through this treaty and I can confirm this, it's just the same as in the previous draft, the word election, democracy, ballot, vote does not appear anywhere.
[00:49:40.097 --> 00:49:45.958]  The one thing that's quite clear is that these enormous powers of taxation and interference
[00:49:46.593 --> 00:49:55.819]  Enormous amounts of levying this and taxing that and funding the other are all going to be without any representation at all.
[00:49:55.839 --> 00:50:09.767]  Now, the old principle, as you know well, on which the US Constitution is founded, is that there should be no taxation of any citizen unless the body taxing that citizen represents that citizen by being elected by him.
[00:50:09.907 --> 00:50:12.309]  No taxation without representation, it's called.
[00:50:12.782 --> 00:50:20.467]  But this world climate body, this world government, is not going to be elected by anyone.
[00:50:20.547 --> 00:50:31.574]  It's going to be a self-appointed, self-perpetuating bureaucracy, just like the EU commissars who now run the European Union and make 90% of our laws.
[00:50:31.634 --> 00:50:32.755]  We have a parliament, of course.
[00:50:33.055 --> 00:50:34.697]  It's more or less completely redundant.
[00:50:34.757 --> 00:50:37.159]  We might as well let it go into the tent.
[00:50:37.439 --> 00:50:51.331]  But they're now trying to use that model and have it on an international scale with no election, no ballot, no vote, no right to call these people to account, no right to question them, no right to remove them, no right to replace them.
[00:50:51.732 --> 00:50:54.054]  This is a test of democracy worldwide.
[00:50:54.534 --> 00:51:07.838]  So when the United Nations says this is the greatest moment for world government, this is the year of the establishment of global governance as the head of the EU and as Ban Ki-moon, the head of the UN Secretary General, has said, they really mean it.
[00:51:08.598 --> 00:51:11.199]  And so we now stand here at the precipice.
[00:51:11.259 --> 00:51:12.939]  You are there in Copenhagen.
[00:51:13.259 --> 00:51:14.560]  Here's the big question.
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:17.721]  What do you predict is going to happen?
[00:51:19.441 --> 00:51:26.242]  If we lose this and they do get ratified, then we start fighting it at the national level, what do you see happening?
[00:51:27.102 --> 00:51:31.003]  That this treaty has been through several negotiating rounds.
[00:51:31.923 --> 00:51:48.066]  And yet, although they've taken out the word government, because I've screamed at them and you've screamed at them and everybody's screamed at them, all the mechanisms of government, all the funding sources, the funding streams as they call them, or funding windows in the latest phrase, sounds very coy but actually it means
[00:51:48.453 --> 00:51:50.274]  Ways of raiding the taxpayer's pocket.
[00:51:50.875 --> 00:51:57.779]  All of these things are still in place and have not only survived the previous draft but have been considerably amplified.
[00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:09.127]  So what we're looking at is, I'm afraid there's no other way of putting this, it is a worldwide conspiracy by the governing class against the governed.
[00:52:09.767 --> 00:52:12.289]  By the big boys against the little guys.
[00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:14.970]  By the rich against the poor.
[00:52:15.171 --> 00:52:17.232]  By the strong against the weak.
[00:52:17.941 --> 00:52:27.450]  And if you're a little guy doing your honest job of work to protect and pay for your family, you have good reason to be very frightened at this moment.
[00:52:27.931 --> 00:52:41.604]  And if you think that our kind host and I have been winding each other up and frothing at the mouth about something that's just another global government conspiracy theory, I just have three words.
[00:52:42.535 --> 00:52:44.075]  Read the treaty.
[00:52:44.416 --> 00:53:00.460]  After a lot of the fuss I've made, there is a chance that by now, if you go onto the UN Framework Convention website, which I think is unfccc.int, then you may be able to find this treaty now in draft.
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:04.661]  Because I have made quite a big stink about it not being immediately available when I asked
[00:53:05.575 --> 00:53:09.657]  I think they have been shamed now into putting this up on the web.
[00:53:09.717 --> 00:53:11.557]  It'll probably still be quite hard to find.
[00:53:11.737 --> 00:53:30.705]  Why don't you all have a look if you doubt in any way what I've been saying to you about the magnitude and breadth of the scope of this treaty, the powers and the wealth that it will transfer from you and your country to an alien, unelected,
[00:53:31.118 --> 00:53:41.004]  We're looking at a communistic bureaucracy with power to control all free markets worldwide, with the power to levy taxes on every financial transaction that crosses an international border.
[00:53:41.264 --> 00:54:00.535]  We're looking at an enormous, enormous communistic government, which in its sheer scale is disproportionate to any conceivable threat from CO2, particularly now that we know by measurement that all of the UN models were wrong and CO2 is simply harmless.
[00:54:01.118 --> 00:54:04.739]  It's an outrage, and I'd like to tell you, if I may, what you should do about it.
[00:54:05.719 --> 00:54:18.962]  As soon as you have finished listening to this program, you must dive for the telephone, and you must telephone the US Senate, and you must demand to speak to your senator, or to one of his senior staffers.
[00:54:19.062 --> 00:54:24.203]  Do not be farmed off with a receptionist, a switchboard operator, a secretary, or an intern.
[00:54:24.656 --> 00:54:40.524]  You must speak to a senior staffer or to the Senator himself, and you must bring both of the Senators for your State, and they'll tell you on the switchboard who those Senators are, and you must say, the Treaty of Copenhagen shall not pass.
[00:54:41.024 --> 00:54:50.989]  The more of you do this, the more vigorously you do it, the more plainly, but always politely, you put your point to your Senator and to his senior staff.
[00:54:51.348 --> 00:54:55.350]  The more likely it is that the Senate will refuse to ratify this treaty.
[00:54:56.151 --> 00:55:19.064]  And even though there are various backdoor ways by which Obama has already said via his staff during the election campaign that he would try to circumvent your Constitution by going round the back and allowing the treaty to be enacted into domestic law by a simple majority of both houses, or simply by signing it by his executive authority,
[00:55:19.548 --> 00:55:19.868]  I think?
[00:55:38.101 --> 00:55:59.805]  ...are told this treaty shall not pass, so that if any of these backdoor ways of pushing the treaty through against the will of the Senate are tried, the Senate will, if necessary, exercise the power that it has to establish the impeachment of your president, if he does try what his staffers said during his campaign for election, that he would try.
[00:56:00.085 --> 00:56:01.386]  So it's up to you now.
[00:56:01.686 --> 00:56:07.787]  You only have ten days left of being a free country with a constitution of your own.
[00:56:08.393 --> 00:56:17.138]  Because once he signs that treaty, and with his Nobel Peace Prize, and the millions of keening zombies screaming at him here in Copenhagen, he will sign anything.
[00:56:17.819 --> 00:56:20.840]  Once that happens, then it's bye-bye to your Constitution.
[00:56:21.221 --> 00:56:26.984]  It's bye-bye to the freedom which America has long been a beacon to the world.
[00:56:27.104 --> 00:56:29.145]  It has offered this beacon of freedom to the world.
[00:56:29.485 --> 00:56:34.228]  Now, you are in immediate peril of losing that freedom.
[00:56:34.508 --> 00:56:37.090]  However extreme what I'm saying to you may sound,
[00:56:37.671 --> 00:56:40.413]  Every word of it is verifiably true.
[00:56:40.453 --> 00:56:45.037]  That is the intention of your... I'm going to call in your Communist... Big Brother.
[00:56:45.117 --> 00:56:47.358]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:47.438 --> 00:56:49.140]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:50.020]  You want answers?
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:52.302]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:52.362 --> 00:56:55.785]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:56.525 --> 00:57:02.546]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

[00:57:08.308 --> 00:57:19.470]  And out of the gates, we are simulcasting the full four hours of this Friday radio show, live at Living Color via television at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:50.157 --> 00:57:55.324]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:57:55.464 --> 00:57:59.850]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:01.833]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:58:02.273 --> 00:58:03.615]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:58:03.895 --> 00:58:04.917]  There is a solution.
[00:58:05.137 --> 00:58:13.159]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:58:50.029 --> 00:58:54.252]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.572 --> 00:58:55.193]  Number one.
[00:58:55.493 --> 00:58:58.635]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:58.915 --> 00:58:59.476]  Number two.
[00:58:59.756 --> 00:59:04.319]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:04.659 --> 00:59:05.120]  It's true.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:09.983]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.284 --> 00:59:10.744]  Number three.
[00:59:11.084 --> 00:59:14.387]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:14.667 --> 00:59:18.430]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:19.391 --> 00:59:21.772]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.153 --> 00:59:25.495]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.616 --> 00:59:30.539]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:30.759 --> 00:59:35.523]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:59:51.095 --> 00:59:54.096]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:59:54.696 --> 00:59:57.977]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:04.099 --> 01:00:04.739]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.399 --> 01:00:06.519]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.179 --> 01:00:08.300]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:09.760]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:11.421]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.081 --> 01:00:15.662]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.262 --> 01:00:20.303]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.914 --> 01:00:23.275]  I'm good.
[01:00:24.302 --> 01:00:40.325]  We are live on this Friday the 11th day of December 2009 and out of the gates we are simulcasting the full four hours of this Friday radio show live in living color via television at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:00:40.905 --> 01:00:53.047]  Congressman Ron Paul is scheduled to join us in the next segment but they are voting today up on Capitol Hill so that may fluctuate it does routinely when he is on Capitol Hill.
[01:00:55.401 --> 01:01:01.175]  You know, I've talked for years about how the global government plan is only the beginning.
[01:01:02.608 --> 01:01:25.428]  The United Nations documents, the Club of Rome documents, Council on Foreign Relations, State Department memorandums, biological diversity assessments, hundreds of government-funded textbooks, call for a planetary regime, that's a quote, planetary police state government, that's a quote, planetary dictatorship, that's a quote, to carry out eugenics.
[01:01:26.633 --> 01:01:28.194]  This is what makes the whole world tick.
[01:01:28.795 --> 01:01:31.277]  It's why the license plate reading cameras are going in.
[01:01:31.337 --> 01:01:35.781]  It's why the CPS is interrogating all of your children and training them to spy on you.
[01:01:36.482 --> 01:01:38.103]  It's why the family is under attack.
[01:01:38.143 --> 01:01:44.849]  It's why our industrial society has been de-industrialized by design, publicly announced by the United Nations.
[01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:48.533]  And we're now going into the next deeper phase of this.
[01:01:49.861 --> 01:02:03.465]  The Chinese government officially yesterday, in the largest paper in the country and at the Copenhagen Summit, called for a planetary regime to force a one-child policy to begin with.
[01:02:04.185 --> 01:02:17.469]  Simultaneously, papers across the world, TV news networks and others, called for a one-child policy to cut the carbon footprint, the deadly carbon dioxide now listed as a chemical toxin.
[01:02:18.149 --> 01:02:20.590]  Even though plants breathe it, humans exhale it.
[01:02:22.051 --> 01:02:33.335]  And so we're going to be going over the latest on Climategate, the latest on the establishment of world government, and what this world's going to look like if these people succeed, and I want to break down the phases of control.
[01:02:37.512 --> 01:02:49.888]  It just has really hit me hard again last night and this morning how serious this is, how dire this is, how criminal and just viciously controlling and selfish the planetary controllers and their minions are.
[01:02:52.782 --> 01:02:56.483]  We need to have a call to arms peaceably in the Infowar.
[01:02:56.543 --> 01:02:57.924]  A call to the Infowar.
[01:02:58.664 --> 01:03:02.466]  To really call these people out for what they are, bloodthirsty killers.
[01:03:02.626 --> 01:03:07.127]  They're already killing people all over the planet, thanks to starvation and cutting off water supplies.
[01:03:07.527 --> 01:03:14.230]  And I want to detail their plan today, after Congressman Ron Paul leaves us.
[01:03:15.623 --> 01:03:23.028]  Of course, Bob Chapman will give us his once a week visit on the economy as well as he does every Friday for part of the third hour.
[01:03:23.068 --> 01:03:26.370]  We'll also have open phones later in the broadcast.
[01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:27.530]  They're not open yet.
[01:03:29.371 --> 01:03:32.874]  But here is the mainstream news article, China Daily.
[01:03:33.094 --> 01:03:34.855]  That's their big paper, government paper.
[01:03:35.395 --> 01:03:38.117]  Population control called key to deal.
[01:03:39.077 --> 01:03:42.720]  China says they'll sign on if the new planetary government
[01:03:43.675 --> 01:03:46.737]  Implements a one-child policy.
[01:03:49.499 --> 01:03:53.923]  So we're going to be going over that after we come back.
[01:03:53.983 --> 01:04:01.608]  Also, the National Post out of Canada says the real inconvenient truth, the whole world needs to adopt China's one-child policy.
[01:04:01.988 --> 01:04:06.512]  Scores of other papers are announcing children are evil carbon blobs.
[01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:18.601]  And of course ABC News is reporting that children are being taught in public schools under a UN program with UNESCO when they should die, that their carbon credits run out at age 11.
[01:04:19.741 --> 01:04:24.703]  And of course, the National ID Card under treaty will keep a tally of your carbon credits.
[01:04:24.823 --> 01:04:26.923]  So that is all going into place.
[01:04:26.943 --> 01:04:28.044]  We're going to go to a quick break.
[01:04:28.404 --> 01:04:32.405]  We have Congressman Ron Paul on the line with us from Washington.
[01:04:32.425 --> 01:04:36.766]  And we'll go directly to Congressman Ron Paul on a host of issues.
[01:04:37.126 --> 01:04:38.707]  Government takeover of health care.
[01:04:39.267 --> 01:04:41.728]  His audit of the Fed bill.
[01:04:42.708 --> 01:04:45.069]  Obama getting the peace prize.
[01:04:45.709 --> 01:04:51.271]  The communist Chinese calling for a planetary regime to enforce one-child policies.
[01:04:51.772 --> 01:04:57.934]  We'll talk to the congressman, the leader, in the fight for liberty and freedom globally, straight ahead.
[01:04:59.793 --> 01:05:02.395]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:02.795 --> 01:05:07.758]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:08.118 --> 01:05:09.879]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:10.179 --> 01:05:14.982]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:15.182 --> 01:05:16.083]  How much do you want?
[01:05:16.343 --> 01:05:17.104]  When do you want it?
[01:05:17.484 --> 01:05:19.085]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:05:19.365 --> 01:05:20.186]  When will you need it?
[01:05:20.426 --> 01:05:22.508]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:05:22.628 --> 01:05:23.749]  Will there be any food?
[01:05:23.969 --> 01:05:25.310]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:30.574]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:05:30.774 --> 01:05:33.957]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:05:34.357 --> 01:05:37.820]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:39.160]  How much will you need?
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.001]  We don't know.
[01:05:40.301 --> 01:05:41.201]  How much do you want?
[01:05:41.401 --> 01:05:42.141]  All you can get.
[01:05:42.341 --> 01:05:43.182]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:43.422 --> 01:05:46.202]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:05:46.483 --> 01:05:48.643]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:48.663 --> 01:05:49.683]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:01.437 --> 01:06:07.458]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:08.059 --> 01:06:11.099]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:15.280]  Big Brother.
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:17.061]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:17.721 --> 01:06:18.821]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:19.481 --> 01:06:20.301]  You want answers?
[01:06:21.062 --> 01:06:21.862]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:22.622 --> 01:06:26.323]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:26.803 --> 01:06:30.844]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:06:32.279 --> 01:06:35.780]  Okay, we've got him until the bottom of the hour, unless the bell rings.
[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:37.960]  There's a vote at 12.30 Eastern.
[01:06:38.501 --> 01:06:41.821]  We've got Ron Paul for the next 20 minutes.
[01:06:42.061 --> 01:06:55.825]  I want to first play a clip for the Congressman of the Herman Van Rompuy, the head of the EU, saying that the carbon tax and this treaty will be the birth of world governance.
[01:06:56.505 --> 01:07:01.429]  And then I want to play Al Gore saying the same thing and get the congressman's take out of the gates on that subject.
[01:07:01.709 --> 01:07:03.711]  Here is the new head of the EU.
[01:07:04.091 --> 01:07:10.537]  9 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis.
[01:07:11.538 --> 01:07:17.923]  The climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet.
[01:07:19.156 --> 01:07:21.739]  Okay, and he goes on for many minutes after that.
[01:07:21.779 --> 01:07:26.903]  Here's Al Gore saying that environmentalism is the key to global governance.
[01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:30.587]  Here is Al Gore, former Vice President Al Gore.
[01:07:31.388 --> 01:07:33.550]  But it is the awareness itself.
[01:07:34.929 --> 01:07:36.830]  That will drive the change.
[01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:42.771]  And one of the ways it will drive the change is through global governance and global payments.
[01:07:42.791 --> 01:07:43.452]  OK.
[01:07:43.472 --> 01:07:47.533]  Congressman, for 30 years you've warned of global government reading their own documents.
[01:07:48.153 --> 01:08:01.437]  I have the Danish text leaked of the treaty calling for global governance, global authority over all air travel, over the oceans, 2% tax, flat tax on all GDPs, paid to the IMF and World Bank.
[01:08:03.398 --> 01:08:20.130]  No way, and in a way it may serve to our benefit because the people are going to wake up just as our federal government fails.
[01:08:20.170 --> 01:08:29.217]  You know, we hear more about nullification and secession and I figure that when the federal government fails or the money fails, there's going to be a lot of independence declared.
[01:08:29.844 --> 01:08:38.722]  So even though they're bold and they're making these plans, they're not going to be effective and it may serve our purpose in waking up the people.
[01:08:39.389 --> 01:08:47.356]  They've been pushing this for a good many years, but you know, 20 years ago approximately, when the Soviet system collapsed, they quit using the word socialism.
[01:08:47.837 --> 01:08:54.703]  But they shifted over toward this environmental effort, claiming that they could get government control through this.
[01:08:54.763 --> 01:09:03.571]  And they have done an amazing job infiltrating our public school system and indoctrinating our young kids and young kids going home.
[01:09:04.191 --> 01:09:04.851]  We're good to go.
[01:09:25.333 --> 01:09:40.712]  I've interviewed literally hundreds of reporters that have been at these different globalist summits, including five or six the last few days at Copenhagen, and they say that there's a sense of desperation and panic by the big banks, predominantly, that are funding this private corporate global government.
[01:09:41.512 --> 01:09:56.485]  Sir, do you agree with me, or perhaps you can elaborate on the fact that now that they've been revealed, because we did our job in the face of ridicule and exposed their global government plan, that now because they've been exposed, they're coming out in the open and being more bold and honest about it.
[01:09:56.565 --> 01:09:58.527]  I mean, what's your take on why they're so bold?
[01:09:58.587 --> 01:10:00.108]  Well, I think that could be it.
[01:10:00.148 --> 01:10:01.950]  They have to be more aggressive.
[01:10:02.461 --> 01:10:18.813]  But in many ways, though, people are backing off from this because some major candidates have been supporters of cap-and-trade and have taken their names off the bill, so they're starting to understand this.
[01:10:21.054 --> 01:10:22.375]  You know, audit the Fed thing.
[01:10:22.415 --> 01:10:27.959]  You know, just look how the establishment come down hard and Bernanke hiring lobbyists and him writing editorials.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.461]  It hasn't seemed to help their side.
[01:10:30.481 --> 01:10:31.842]  They're still on the defensive.
[01:10:32.222 --> 01:10:33.583]  But we are in a struggle.
[01:10:33.703 --> 01:10:34.624]  There is no doubt.
[01:10:34.704 --> 01:10:35.784]  And they are going to get tougher.
[01:10:36.525 --> 01:10:40.067]  And right now, too many of them have too much power in different governments.
[01:10:40.167 --> 01:10:46.472]  And if they take this next step that they can exert power with a world government and a world military,
[01:10:47.232 --> 01:11:10.090]  Uh, which is partially here already, then we're in very big trouble, but I tend to want to be more optimistic, thinking that the people will wake up and we have the tools, still the radio, hopefully that'll last, and still we have the internet, hopefully that'll last, but they're capable of closing us down, so this is vital that we wake up as many people as possible, as quickly as possible.
[01:11:10.768 --> 01:11:17.930]  Congressman, you brought up the fact that the Senate is now saying they're probably not going to ratify the treaty, even if Obama signs it.
[01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:34.234]  That may be a red herring to make us stand down, but then it looks like it may be real because, as you know, Obama, two days ago, was in the Associated Press, headline, Obama threatens command and control, and tells Congress, the real boss in our system of government, the three
[01:11:34.694 --> 01:11:39.824]  Three pillars of government, legislative, executive, judicial, saying I don't care if you don't pass this.
[01:11:40.085 --> 01:11:43.451]  The EPA is going to implement this by executive fiat.
[01:11:44.113 --> 01:11:49.778]  Yeah, and that goes to show what they can do, you know, on a system that we've allowed to be created.
[01:11:50.199 --> 01:11:53.982]  You know, the executive branch has tremendous powers, and the courts won't help us.
[01:11:54.343 --> 01:12:04.012]  They write regulations, they have the force of law, and it reminds me of that statement, stroke of the pen, law of the land, kind of cool, and that's how powerful presidents are.
[01:12:04.072 --> 01:12:09.197]  They write executive orders, they write signing statements, and they do what they want.
[01:12:09.964 --> 01:12:22.193]  And this is why the movement is getting very, very disgusted and saying, you know, they keep talking about nullification and secession and that growth is going to continue.
[01:12:22.513 --> 01:12:24.494]  In closing, congressman, some good news.
[01:12:25.115 --> 01:12:26.756]  You got 311 sponsors.
[01:12:26.796 --> 01:12:27.877]  It's passed out of committee.
[01:12:28.337 --> 01:12:29.038]  Audit the Fed.
[01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:29.818]  The Fed's admitted.
[01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:31.559]  You audit us, you'll destroy us.
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:34.161]  In the last three minutes we've got left, sir.
[01:12:34.601 --> 01:12:35.502]  Auditing the Fed.
[01:12:35.542 --> 01:12:36.603]  Give us a report on that.
[01:12:37.395 --> 01:12:45.018]  Okay, I think most know that last week it was put into a bank regulation bill, which is a monster of a bill.
[01:12:45.518 --> 01:12:50.981]  When it came out of the committee, I voted against the bill because I don't vote for a few good things when there's a lot of bad things in it.
[01:12:51.021 --> 01:12:56.203]  But my amendment won by 42 to 26, which was a major victory.
[01:12:56.543 --> 01:12:58.424]  It's on the House floor at this moment.
[01:12:58.564 --> 01:13:00.465]  It will be voted on at the end of the day.
[01:13:01.185 --> 01:13:01.826]  Unbelievable.
[01:13:08.365 --> 01:13:10.066]  And the auditing provision will be in there.
[01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:19.509]  The real work needs to be done in the Senate, so if anybody knows where their Senator stands, try to urge the Senators to get on that same bill.
[01:13:19.549 --> 01:13:23.751]  I think it's 604, and there's 30 in over there.
[01:13:23.811 --> 01:13:37.056]  There's been several Senators that have put a hold on Bernanke's reappointment, unless they have a vote on 1207, the auditing bill, in the Senate.
[01:13:37.583 --> 01:13:40.345]  So sir, this is a massive victory.
[01:13:40.505 --> 01:13:46.991]  I mean, today it looks like they're gonna probably pass it in the House, it'll go to the Senate, and then the fight's in the Senate.
[01:13:47.011 --> 01:13:48.272]  This is incredible news!
[01:13:49.025 --> 01:13:50.806]  Yeah, it's big.
[01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:53.968]  We have no idea, you know, exactly what will happen.
[01:13:54.008 --> 01:13:58.371]  There'll be a lot more resistance in the Senate, and the Fed still has time to do all that they do.
[01:13:58.871 --> 01:14:03.554]  But nevertheless, I think you're correct in describing this as a major victory for the people.
[01:14:04.794 --> 01:14:07.136]  I mean, the grassroots got this done.
[01:14:07.336 --> 01:14:08.657]  I didn't twist arms.
[01:14:08.717 --> 01:14:10.618]  I have no clout up here in that sense.
[01:14:11.218 --> 01:14:16.781]  But we have 313 on there, all Republicans and a lot of Democrats.
[01:14:17.361 --> 01:14:25.505]  It's really a great testament to what can happen when the people come together because this is not a conservative Republican bill.
[01:14:25.565 --> 01:14:35.710]  I mean, it's liberals and populists and libertarians and constitutionalists have all come around to believing enough is enough and the Fed is too big and too secret.
[01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:41.613]  And we finally identified it as the real shadow government instead of Republican and Democrat puppets.
[01:14:41.633 --> 01:14:43.854]  You've been working for close to 30 years for this.
[01:14:44.235 --> 01:14:47.256]  Even if we don't have victory this year, we're a hair away.
[01:14:47.636 --> 01:14:50.858]  It'll be assured next year as the crisis accelerates.
[01:14:50.878 --> 01:14:51.519]  Do you agree with that?
[01:14:51.679 --> 01:14:54.600]  Yeah, I don't think they'll be able to ever.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:57.302]  If they squelch us, it'll just make it a bigger issue.
[01:14:57.822 --> 01:15:04.726]  And the problems are going to get worse and they will know where to look and they have to look to the Federal Reserve System to find a real source of our problems.
[01:15:05.006 --> 01:15:06.647]  Well, Congressman, I salute you.
[01:15:06.707 --> 01:15:10.310]  Your book is a bestseller in the Fed and bookstores and on Amazon.com.
[01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:12.471]  Go to CampaignForLiberty.com.
[01:15:12.711 --> 01:15:15.113]  Go to all the great sites of Ron Paul supporting.
[01:15:15.133 --> 01:15:17.654]  Thank him for running for president a few years ago.
[01:15:17.715 --> 01:15:21.157]  That really helped focus this Coalition for Liberty and Freedom.
[01:15:21.177 --> 01:15:25.900]  And I know I'll talk to you again early next year, Congressman, with your once-a-month check-in with us.
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:27.141]  Thank you so much.
[01:15:27.581 --> 01:15:31.484]  And get out there and cast that vote for the bill you wrote and introduced.
[01:15:31.784 --> 01:15:32.665]  We salute you.
[01:15:32.905 --> 01:15:34.606]  And what a great Christmas gift, sir.
[01:15:34.966 --> 01:15:35.226]  Thank you.
[01:15:35.506 --> 01:15:36.186]  Good to talk to you.
[01:15:36.206 --> 01:15:37.987]  Thank you so much, Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:41.228]  Absolutely amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:41.828 --> 01:15:43.008]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:15:43.268 --> 01:15:44.728]  Yeah, world government's coming in.
[01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:46.249]  But the war's on.
[01:15:46.289 --> 01:15:47.209]  We're fighting back.
[01:15:47.529 --> 01:15:48.429]  Our numbers are growing.
[01:15:48.449 --> 01:15:49.390]  We're having victories.
[01:15:49.690 --> 01:15:51.670]  We're learning we can stand up against bullies.
[01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:54.831]  Like when you finally go ahead and punch that bully in the nose, his nose breaks.
[01:16:00.307 --> 01:16:05.494]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:16:05.614 --> 01:16:10.020]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:12.003]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:16:12.423 --> 01:16:13.785]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:16:14.045 --> 01:16:15.087]  There is a solution.
[01:16:15.307 --> 01:16:23.329]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:17:07.235 --> 01:17:08.475]  No, this isn't science fiction.

[01:18:00.011 --> 01:18:04.253]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:18:04.553 --> 01:18:05.174]  Number one.
[01:18:05.474 --> 01:18:08.636]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:18:08.896 --> 01:18:09.476]  Number two.
[01:18:09.756 --> 01:18:14.319]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:18:14.659 --> 01:18:15.119]  It's true.
[01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:19.942]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:18:20.262 --> 01:18:20.803]  Number 3.
[01:18:21.083 --> 01:18:24.366]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:28.409]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:28.850]  Number 4.
[01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:31.752]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:18:32.153 --> 01:18:35.536]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:18:35.836 --> 01:18:36.357]  Number 5.
[01:18:36.617 --> 01:18:40.540]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:18:40.761 --> 01:18:45.525]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:20:01.178 --> 01:20:04.059]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:04.759 --> 01:20:08.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:09.301 --> 01:20:20.884]  Beyond their plans to devastate the economy for global consolidation, a new international framework of draconian law is being constructed to establish a system of neo-feudalistic serfdom.
[01:20:21.584 --> 01:20:24.925]  Remember, it was Bill Clinton who gave us NAFTA.
[01:20:26.806 --> 01:20:30.147]  And it was Al Gore, the hero of the environmental movement,
[01:20:31.192 --> 01:20:38.776]  Who was the hatchet man for the Clinton administration to cram NAFTA down the throats of a reluctant Congress.
[01:20:39.577 --> 01:20:44.299]  Now this is a good deal for our country, Larry, and let me explain why.
[01:20:44.759 --> 01:20:51.543]  Al Gore, who carried the ball for NAFTA and GATT, is now one of the top standard bearers for the elite's agenda.
[01:20:52.704 --> 01:20:53.504]  I didn't interrupt you.
[01:20:53.804 --> 01:20:54.825]  Okay, guys.
[01:20:56.276 --> 01:20:58.840]  Well, maybe it just... Is this... NAFTA.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:20:59.380]  Why?
[01:20:59.761 --> 01:21:06.309]  Huge numbers of manufacturing jobs left Canada, came into the United States because of a 15% wage differential.
[01:21:06.349 --> 01:21:07.991]  We pay our workers less in Canada.
[01:21:09.105 --> 01:21:15.927]  Now, when you've got a 7 to 1 wage differential between the United States and Mexico, you will hear the giant sucking sound.
[01:21:15.947 --> 01:21:18.547]  There's a political lesson, there's a business lesson.
[01:21:18.987 --> 01:21:34.031]  He serves as the front man for the carbon tax cap and trade scheme, which will not only increase taxes on every American, but will also transfer our national sovereignty and rights to a tyrannical world government, all in the name of saving the Earth.
[01:21:36.682 --> 01:21:44.586]  Is the legislation that we are discussing here today, is that something that you are going to personally benefit from?
[01:21:44.846 --> 01:21:55.571]  If you believe that the reason I have been working on this issue for 30 years is because of greed, you don't know me.
[01:21:55.871 --> 01:21:58.472]  I've been willing to put my money where my mouth is.
[01:21:58.532 --> 01:22:02.414]  Do you think there's something wrong with being active in business in this country?
[01:22:03.377 --> 01:22:06.980]  I am simply asking for clarification of the relationship.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:07.341]  I'm proud of it.
[01:22:07.361 --> 01:22:08.041]  I'm proud of it.
[01:22:09.462 --> 01:22:10.663]  My name is Dr. Tim Ball.
[01:22:11.304 --> 01:22:12.365]  I'm a climatologist.
[01:22:12.385 --> 01:22:16.869]  I have a PhD in climatology from the Queen Mary College, University of London, England.
[01:22:17.589 --> 01:22:27.058]  And I've been studying climate both with my nine years in the Canadian Air Force, where it was essential to flying, and then after that at the university.
[01:22:27.118 --> 01:22:30.801]  So it's essentially been the whole theme of my career.
[01:22:32.352 --> 01:22:34.575]  Initially we were called climate skeptics.
[01:22:35.296 --> 01:22:37.178]  I said, but all scientists are skeptics.
[01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:39.922]  If you're not a skeptic, you're not a scientist.
[01:22:40.803 --> 01:22:47.612]  And then when that didn't work, then they came out with the charge that we were climate change deniers.
[01:22:48.653 --> 01:22:54.096]  And I remember when I was first called a denier and it was in the Times of London in England.
[01:22:54.296 --> 01:23:01.899]  And of course the word denier was clearly deliberately chosen because of the Holocaust connotations of that term.
[01:23:02.579 --> 01:23:10.443]  So it was not only a charge that you were ignoring the truth, but you were doing it in a very evil way.
[01:23:11.323 --> 01:23:14.445]  And of course I laugh about that now because
[01:23:15.445 --> 01:23:19.189]  My whole career has been anything but a climate change denier.
[01:23:19.650 --> 01:23:24.595]  I've spent my career trying to educate people to how much climate change is naturally.
[01:23:24.615 --> 01:23:31.262]  So I'm anything but a denier, but of course that is part of the politics.
[01:23:31.562 --> 01:23:34.103]  Under the Nazis, there was something called race science.
[01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:40.065]  They had a lunatic theory of eugenics, the Aryan heritage, and all the rest of this.
[01:23:40.465 --> 01:23:42.646]  Absolute crackpot pseudoscience.
[01:23:43.326 --> 01:23:48.689]  There was no empirical measure or empirical test for the validity of those theories.
[01:23:48.729 --> 01:23:49.269]  They simply
[01:23:50.169 --> 01:23:54.971]  Asserted them, and if you were a professor who stood up to them, then the Gestapo would come and take you away.
[01:23:55.371 --> 01:23:57.933]  We are perilously close to such a situation right now.
[01:23:58.333 --> 01:24:07.337]  Any academic, any other figure standing up to say, the global warming theory of Al Gore is a piece of crackpot nonsense, is in danger.
[01:24:07.397 --> 01:24:11.899]  You'd be fired from a government job, and in many universities, your job would be in danger.
[01:24:12.279 --> 01:24:20.212]  And of course, it's also part of what's called ad hominem, that if you can't defeat the person's argument rationally, you start attacking the person.
[01:24:20.873 --> 01:24:26.162]  And we see that with these terms, and we see it with Al Gore calling them flat earthers.
[01:24:26.784 --> 01:24:31.628]  Congressman, you began by denying that there is a consensus on the science.
[01:24:32.429 --> 01:24:34.291]  There is a consensus on the science.
[01:24:34.451 --> 01:24:41.978]  You must have been listening to our testimony that we've had for the last few days with dozens of experts that have come in who have given completely different views.
[01:24:42.058 --> 01:24:45.661]  Well, there are people... I would encourage you to go back and look at the testimony.
[01:24:45.681 --> 01:24:46.542]  This committee's heard.
[01:24:47.042 --> 01:24:52.888]  There are people who still believe that the moon landing was staged on a movie lot in Arizona.
[01:24:53.843 --> 01:24:54.984]  And neither of us is one of those.
[01:24:55.044 --> 01:24:56.904]  And I know you like giving those cute anecdotes.
[01:24:57.044 --> 01:24:58.345]  This is not a cutesy issue.
[01:24:58.365 --> 01:25:03.167]  We're talking about export millions of jobs out of our economy, out of our country.
[01:25:04.087 --> 01:25:13.491]  Richard Lindzen, the MIT professor of atmospheric physics, said it many years ago when he said, the consensus was reached before the research had even begun.
[01:25:14.532 --> 01:25:19.494]  And then scientists like myself that stood up and said, hold on a minute, I got problems with it.
[01:25:19.774 --> 01:25:21.695]  Oh, paid by the oil companies.
[01:25:21.735 --> 01:25:22.775]  Don't trust that guy.
[01:25:23.735 --> 01:25:27.480]  What the international scientific community is saying is correct.
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:31.125]  There is no legitimate basis for denying it.
[01:25:31.485 --> 01:25:35.027]  Now, you hear the consensus argument, well, the majority of scientists.
[01:25:35.468 --> 01:25:43.413]  What they're always talking about is, and originally the IPCC was about 3,600 scientists, it's now down to 2,500.
[01:25:44.053 --> 01:25:45.754]  That's the people they're talking about.
[01:25:46.395 --> 01:25:51.218]  But when you look at it, most of them are bureaucrats, they're not scientists at all.
[01:25:51.818 --> 01:25:55.160]  And very, very few of them are actual climate experts.
[01:25:55.781 --> 01:26:00.063]  Now, the consequences of that, and whether that's because of man-made CO2,
[01:26:01.457 --> 01:26:02.619]  I think they're debatable.
[01:26:20.547 --> 01:26:24.190]  It's unbelievable to me that they can come out and ignore the sun.
[01:26:25.752 --> 01:26:28.994]  Everybody knows the sun goes in, it gets cool.
[01:26:29.295 --> 01:26:29.995]  You notice that, right?
[01:26:30.175 --> 01:26:36.141]  You have an eclipse, the temperature drops and the birds start to get excited and so on.
[01:26:36.161 --> 01:26:45.709]  And when you look at the seasonal changes with the sun, how you can suggest that the sun is not a factor is really quite remarkable.
[01:26:47.096 --> 01:26:52.703]  Giving us false scientific information is not going to clean up our environment.
[01:26:53.864 --> 01:27:01.994]  Speaking with a lot of promises and innuendo is not going to help clean up our environment.
[01:27:02.755 --> 01:27:05.278]  The globalists have co-opted the environmental movement.
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:12.810]  There are a lot of real environmental problems we face like genetic engineering where they're splicing plants, animals, insects, you name it.
[01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:14.772]  Toxic waste dumping in the ocean.
[01:27:15.433 --> 01:27:19.740]  No one wants to breathe bad air or drink toxic water.
[01:27:20.845 --> 01:27:23.027]  But the global carbon tax has nothing to do with that.
[01:27:23.548 --> 01:27:25.389]  It's a tax literally on breathing.
[01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:28.352]  Go out on the street or talk to your friends, your neighbors.
[01:27:28.813 --> 01:27:32.116]  Ask them, hey, should we ban dihydrogen monoxide?
[01:27:32.656 --> 01:27:33.837]  It's bad for the environment.
[01:27:34.458 --> 01:27:38.702]  The average person will sign your petition calling for the banning of water.
[01:27:39.443 --> 01:27:39.903]  That's right.
[01:27:40.544 --> 01:27:42.245]  Dihydrogen monoxide is water.
[01:27:42.926 --> 01:27:45.889]  It's the same thing with table salt, sodium chloride.
[01:27:47.230 --> 01:27:52.114]  And that's exactly what the establishment is doing with carbon dioxide.
[01:27:52.494 --> 01:27:53.695]  Ooh, dioxide.
[01:27:54.075 --> 01:27:56.437]  It has this scary sounding name.
[01:27:56.978 --> 01:28:00.540]  But the truth is, it's one of the four elements of life on this planet.
[01:28:01.561 --> 01:28:05.805]  Oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight.
[01:28:06.710 --> 01:28:14.196]  The idea that carbon is a pollutant is essentially a way of saying that humanity is a disease or a cancer that ought to be wiped out.
[01:28:14.216 --> 01:28:14.957]  Genocide.
[01:28:37.386 --> 01:28:50.315]  People have argued in this environmental coterie around Obama, around Holdren, the theoretician of de-development who is now the science advisor of the White House, really the anti-science advisor.
[01:28:50.815 --> 01:28:56.779]  They've argued that babies are carbon monsters, carbon machines.
[01:29:02.267 --> 01:29:05.888]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:29:06.228 --> 01:29:14.349]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:29:15.089 --> 01:29:19.130]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:29:19.710 --> 01:29:30.532]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:29:31.152 --> 01:29:40.174]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:29:40.674 --> 01:29:45.715]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:29:46.116 --> 01:29:53.297]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:29:53.597 --> 01:29:55.998]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:30:01.474 --> 01:30:05.098]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:30:05.478 --> 01:30:08.502]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:30:08.722 --> 01:30:13.507]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:30:13.527 --> 01:30:19.794]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:30:19.934 --> 01:30:22.177]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:30:22.697 --> 01:30:22.977]  Tim Geithner?
[01:30:22.997 --> 01:30:23.418]  Bernanke?
[01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:24.118]  They're arsonists!
[01:30:24.178 --> 01:30:25.439]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:30:25.459 --> 01:30:27.701]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:30:41.593 --> 01:30:45.517]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:30:45.978 --> 01:30:48.561]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:30:48.881 --> 01:30:57.991]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:31:00.694 --> 01:31:03.295]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:03.695 --> 01:31:08.677]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.038 --> 01:31:10.758]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.078 --> 01:31:15.901]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.081 --> 01:31:17.041]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.261 --> 01:31:18.001]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.382 --> 01:31:19.982]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.262 --> 01:31:21.103]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.343 --> 01:31:23.404]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.544 --> 01:31:24.664]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:24.884 --> 01:31:26.205]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.405 --> 01:31:31.491]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:31.671 --> 01:31:34.875]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.256 --> 01:31:38.760]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.081]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.321 --> 01:31:40.922]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.222 --> 01:31:42.144]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.324 --> 01:31:43.065]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.265 --> 01:31:44.066]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.326 --> 01:31:47.087]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.387 --> 01:31:49.568]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.588 --> 01:31:50.588]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:59.690 --> 01:32:06.519]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:32:06.659 --> 01:32:08.602]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:32:08.762 --> 01:32:10.885]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:32:11.005 --> 01:32:12.527]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:32:12.667 --> 01:32:16.973]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:32:17.113 --> 01:32:19.494]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[01:32:19.694 --> 01:32:25.497]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecolablue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[01:32:25.697 --> 01:32:30.439]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[01:32:30.499 --> 01:32:33.240]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.

[01:33:01.355 --> 01:33:02.536]  Coast to Coast.
[01:33:02.896 --> 01:33:04.277]  Direct from Austin.
[01:33:04.958 --> 01:33:08.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:08.786 --> 01:33:11.368]  This is absolutely anti-human doctrine.
[01:33:11.588 --> 01:33:19.793]  They use the environmental movement to promote their real agenda, which is globalization and federalization and power.
[01:33:21.055 --> 01:33:26.518]  The advisor to Gordon Brown wants to exterminate one half of the population of the British Isles.
[01:33:26.558 --> 01:33:29.020]  Now that's something Hitler might have tried to do, or Stalin.
[01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:30.220]  They didn't succeed.
[01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:31.361]  Will Gordon Brown do it?
[01:33:31.641 --> 01:33:35.143]  You can read this in the statements of these lunatics.
[01:33:35.584 --> 01:33:40.907]  Radical environmentalists, fanatical Malthusians, tree-huggers, whatever you want to call them.
[01:33:41.307 --> 01:33:49.572]  This is an ideology of genocide which can be documented exhaustively, ad nauseum, out of their own statements.
[01:33:51.314 --> 01:34:01.862]  When Gore said the science is settled, that raised red flags amongst the media, and then also amongst a lot of other people that sort of knew that that wasn't true.
[01:34:01.922 --> 01:34:09.367]  Other scientists started to look at it, and of course the more they looked at it, the more they realized, no, science is never settled.
[01:34:09.608 --> 01:34:15.012]  What is coming down now is environmentalism, is nothing but phony science.
[01:34:16.255 --> 01:34:17.656]  Nothing but phony science.
[01:34:18.217 --> 01:34:26.344]  And if we really believe in the environment, if we really believe in freedom, if we really believe in truth, we need to get some straight answers.
[01:34:26.824 --> 01:34:30.888]  Now, the Kyoto Agreement, of course, was reached in the city of Kyoto.
[01:34:32.109 --> 01:34:37.033]  And what was interesting was several things came out of that.
[01:34:37.093 --> 01:34:41.477]  But the first thing was that not
[01:34:42.452 --> 01:34:49.075]  Well, all countries had to participate in Kyoto, but not all had to take action.
[01:34:49.656 --> 01:34:53.278]  Only the developed nations were required to reduce their level of CO2.
[01:34:53.818 --> 01:34:56.159]  The developing nations were excluded.
[01:34:56.179 --> 01:35:06.365]  Now, of course, at that time, China was, and in some ways you can argue it still is, a developing nation, so it wasn't required to meet any targets under Kyoto, nor was India.
[01:35:06.685 --> 01:35:08.486]  The US, of course, held out.
[01:35:09.417 --> 01:35:10.898]  And what's interesting is that the U.S.
[01:35:10.958 --> 01:35:18.222]  Senate voted 95 to nothing against the Kyoto Accord, even though Al Gore was the vice president at the time.
[01:35:19.142 --> 01:35:23.845]  And lucky for him, he didn't have to cast the deciding vote.
[01:35:24.525 --> 01:35:28.467]  But so it was 95 to nothing against it because the U.S.
[01:35:28.507 --> 01:35:32.829]  Senate saw, no, this is a socialist distribution of wealth.
[01:35:33.169 --> 01:35:35.130]  This is going to cost jobs and economy.
[01:35:35.871 --> 01:35:37.512]  And so they scrapped it completely.
[01:35:38.294 --> 01:35:40.835]  We're now told that you have to buy carbon offsets.
[01:35:40.915 --> 01:35:49.460]  In other words, if you have sinned by having a carbon footprint and by carbon emissions, you've got to buy a carbon offset, which is usually a scam.
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:52.702]  Somebody claims to have planted an acre of grass in the third world.
[01:35:52.782 --> 01:35:53.482]  It never happened.
[01:35:53.502 --> 01:35:55.863]  They take your money and laugh all the way to the bank.
[01:35:55.903 --> 01:36:00.646]  But they're telling you that in order to cleanse your guilt, you've got to buy a carbon offset.
[01:36:01.656 --> 01:36:02.817]  Talk about carbon polluters.
[01:36:02.837 --> 01:36:03.537]  You talk about them.
[01:36:04.098 --> 01:36:16.767]  It's my understanding that back in 1997, when you were Vice President, Enron's CEO, Ken Lay, was involved in discussions with you at the White House about helping develop this type of policy, this trading scheme.
[01:36:17.267 --> 01:36:18.868]  Is that accurate?
[01:36:18.888 --> 01:36:19.589]  Is it inaccurate?
[01:36:19.709 --> 01:36:20.609]  It's been reported.
[01:36:23.397 --> 01:36:31.921]  I don't know, but I met with Ken Lay, as lots of people did before anybody knew that he was a grown-up.
[01:36:32.001 --> 01:36:42.746]  And clearly, you can see why so many of us are concerned about this type of cap-and-trade energy tax that would be literally turning over this country's energy economy.
[01:36:42.766 --> 01:36:44.587]  I didn't know him well enough to call him Kenny Boy.
[01:36:44.927 --> 01:36:54.950]  Well, but you knew him well enough to help devise this trading scheme, and obviously we know what Enron and these big guys on Wall Street like Goldman Sachs, and I know you've got interest with Goldman Sachs.
[01:36:55.150 --> 01:36:55.330]  No.
[01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:58.211]  Well, that's been reported.
[01:36:58.251 --> 01:36:59.271]  Is that not accurate?
[01:36:59.331 --> 01:37:01.452]  No, I wish I did.
[01:37:01.592 --> 01:37:04.693]  You're partnered in companies with executives from Goldman Sachs.
[01:37:04.713 --> 01:37:05.233]  Well, if you're not.
[01:37:05.653 --> 01:37:09.534]  Al Gore has got to be the greatest con artist in modern history.
[01:37:10.182 --> 01:37:11.943]  This guy claims he invented the Internet.
[01:37:12.363 --> 01:37:13.864]  Even though it's on record, he's a liar.
[01:37:14.164 --> 01:37:15.025]  And he got away with it.
[01:37:15.585 --> 01:37:20.167]  He was the pitchman that successfully sold, as Vice President, NAFTA and GATT.
[01:37:20.468 --> 01:37:25.590]  It's lowered the standard of living in the United States and Mexico and almost completely de-industrialized our country.
[01:37:26.331 --> 01:37:32.914]  Now he's saying you should pay him and his private company, set up by Enron, a carbon tax on breathing.
[01:37:33.595 --> 01:37:36.016]  Look, if you want to buy Al Gore's propaganda, go ahead.
[01:37:36.656 --> 01:37:39.638]  But before you do that, you should at least look into the claims he's making.
[01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:49.643]  There was a meeting in the White House in 1998 between Al Gore and Bill Clinton, Ken Lay and Lord Brown.
[01:37:50.204 --> 01:37:51.444]  OK, well, who were these people?
[01:37:51.484 --> 01:37:56.326]  Well, we know the president, the vice president, Ken Lay, of course, was the president of Enron.
[01:37:57.166 --> 01:38:06.770]  And Enron was a major, major player in the carbon credit, carbon trading, and in fact, stood to make an enormous amount of money out of it.
[01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:09.391]  And so it was part of
[01:38:11.138 --> 01:38:13.120]  I think part of the collapse of Enron.
[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:18.443]  And Lord Brown, of course, was the head of the largest oil company in the world.
[01:38:19.164 --> 01:38:31.812]  And they were looking to buy into this, as is happening now, where the energy companies are becoming the big promoters of, oh, we got to go green, we got to go to alternate energies and all of this stuff.
[01:38:32.452 --> 01:38:37.536]  They saw a business opportunity and leapt onto it and one that would make them look green again.
[01:38:39.264 --> 01:38:54.096]  When it came time for the 1,200-plus page greenhouse gas emission and carbon legislation to be voted on, the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, would not let the Republicans, or even members of her own party, see the bill until minutes before the vote.
[01:38:55.597 --> 01:39:04.365]  Republican Minority Leader John Boehner engaged in a rare House filibuster and read shocking section after shocking section from the legislation.
[01:39:04.805 --> 01:39:05.706]  I really hate to do this.
[01:39:06.653 --> 01:39:15.886]  Well, when you file a 300-page amendment at 3.09 a.m., the American people have a right to know what's in this bill, and have a right to know what we're voting on.
[01:39:23.715 --> 01:39:24.375]  Page 48.
[01:39:25.095 --> 01:39:41.659]  Each Building Code Enforcement Department receiving a grant under Subsection A shall unpanel a Code Administration and Enforcement Team consisting of at least one full-time Building Code Enforcement Officer, a City Planner, and a Health Planner or similar officer.
[01:39:42.139 --> 01:39:45.960]  I can take you to Chickasaw, Mercer County in my district.
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:50.941]  They don't have one full-time person that works for the village.
[01:39:51.181 --> 01:39:51.761]  Alright, not one.
[01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:57.734]  Look at the mandate on every city, village in America, right here in this bill.
[01:39:59.316 --> 01:40:07.683]  We're not only going to tell you what the codes are going to be, but we're going to tell you how many people you need to hire to enforce this.
[01:40:08.023 --> 01:40:08.744]  Page 41.
[01:40:08.804 --> 01:40:15.309]  Determine any geographic area within the contiguous United States that lacks a federal power marketing agency.
[01:40:16.155 --> 01:40:21.018]  Because, you know, we can't move power around the country without a federal power marketing agency.
[01:40:21.659 --> 01:40:24.801]  We do it today, but now we have to have a new government agency to do this.
[01:40:25.782 --> 01:40:31.566]  All California housing standards are now going to be imposed on every American community.
[01:40:32.886 --> 01:40:37.450]  You don't have the right to have your own building standards in your community or in your state.
[01:40:37.890 --> 01:40:38.550]  Hell no!
[01:40:38.590 --> 01:40:40.672]  The federal government's going to tell you what they are!
[01:40:41.252 --> 01:40:47.937]  It quickly became clear why Pelosi and the Democratic leadership were desperate to keep the contents of the bill secret before the vote.
[01:40:48.607 --> 01:40:58.512]  Now, because of this underlying bill, the federal government will virtually have control over every aspect of lives for the American people.
[01:40:58.992 --> 01:41:03.314]  It is time to stand up and say, we get to choose.
[01:41:03.715 --> 01:41:06.316]  We choose liberty or we choose tyranny.
[01:41:06.456 --> 01:41:07.396]  It's one of the two.
[01:41:07.857 --> 01:41:12.739]  The underlying bill represents the tyranny and the intervention of the federal government.
[01:41:13.019 --> 01:41:13.820]  It's our choice.
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:15.981]  What will we choose today?
[01:41:16.001 --> 01:41:19.142]  Will we choose liberty, or will we choose tyranny?
[01:41:19.502 --> 01:41:24.544]  And I know that we'll be facing the single moms that heard from last summer.
[01:41:25.025 --> 01:41:27.006]  They can't afford the gasoline bill.
[01:41:27.326 --> 01:41:29.066]  They can't afford the propane.
[01:41:30.607 --> 01:41:31.868]  You didn't do a great thing.
[01:41:32.128 --> 01:41:39.691]  You hurt some really decent families struggling trying to make it, and this is gonna be their death knell.
[01:41:39.871 --> 01:41:40.732]  It breaks my heart.
[01:41:40.792 --> 01:41:41.412]  I yield back.
[01:41:41.872 --> 01:41:43.473]  It is, of course, a carbon tax.
[01:41:44.807 --> 01:41:51.515]  On economic activity, farming, manufacturing, real production here inside the United States.
[01:41:52.055 --> 01:42:05.030]  It would tend to shut down even those miserable remains of an industrial economy that we still have after the collapse of the Detroit automakers and their related subcontractors and so forth.
[01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:09.973]  Every home and business in the United States will be federally regulated and controlled.
[01:42:10.353 --> 01:42:16.638]  Mandatory home inspections will be carried out by federal inspectors, and it's all at the expense of the homeowner.
[01:42:17.219 --> 01:42:19.621]  In New York, they're called the environmental police.
[01:42:19.901 --> 01:42:23.684]  On this day, a surprise visit to a market in Brooklyn's Chinatown.
[01:42:24.184 --> 01:42:25.906]  And every day you're not in compliance.
[01:42:26.126 --> 01:42:27.547]  You face huge fines.
[01:42:27.964 --> 01:42:28.384]  Go to page 235.
[01:42:28.444 --> 01:42:35.791]  The Secretary may set and collect reasonable inspection fees to cover the cost of inspections required.
[01:42:36.311 --> 01:42:40.555]  So number one, they can come in, the federal government can come in, inspect your house, and send you the bill.
[01:42:41.075 --> 01:42:49.182]  And if they find that you're out of compliance with this new federal code, the Secretary shall assess a civil penalty for violations of this section.
[01:42:49.823 --> 01:42:50.923]  And then further, go on to page 236,
[01:42:52.885 --> 01:42:58.708]  Each day of unlawful occupancy shall be considered a separate violation.
[01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:05.532]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to tpr20info.com

[01:44:00.703 --> 01:44:05.890]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:44:06.010 --> 01:44:10.416]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:44:10.536 --> 01:44:12.399]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:44:12.819 --> 01:44:14.181]  You don't have to cooperate.

[01:45:00.609 --> 01:45:04.852]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:45:05.172 --> 01:45:05.773]  Number one.
[01:45:06.073 --> 01:45:09.255]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:45:09.495 --> 01:45:10.076]  Number two.
[01:45:10.356 --> 01:45:14.919]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:15.720]  It's true.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.563]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:45:20.864 --> 01:45:21.324]  Number three.
[01:45:21.684 --> 01:45:24.966]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:45:25.266 --> 01:45:29.009]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.749]  Number 4.
[01:45:29.989 --> 01:45:32.351]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:45:32.751 --> 01:45:36.133]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:45:36.434 --> 01:45:36.634]  Number 5.
[01:45:37.214 --> 01:45:41.137]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:45:41.357 --> 01:45:46.120]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:50.445]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:46:01.069 --> 01:46:03.670]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:46:04.091 --> 01:46:09.053]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:46:09.414 --> 01:46:11.135]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:46:11.475 --> 01:46:16.277]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:46:16.458 --> 01:46:17.418]  How much do you want?
[01:46:17.638 --> 01:46:18.399]  When do you want it?
[01:46:18.779 --> 01:46:20.380]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:21.480]  When will you need it?
[01:46:21.721 --> 01:46:23.802]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:46:23.942 --> 01:46:25.042]  Will there be any food?
[01:46:25.283 --> 01:46:26.603]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:46:26.803 --> 01:46:27.864]  If there's a quarantine,
[01:46:28.004 --> 01:46:29.186]  And you can't feed yourself?
[01:46:29.326 --> 01:46:31.869]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:46:32.049 --> 01:46:35.253]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:46:35.654 --> 01:46:39.158]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:46:39.459 --> 01:46:40.460]  How much will you need?
[01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:41.321]  We don't know.
[01:46:41.601 --> 01:46:42.522]  How much do you want?
[01:46:42.703 --> 01:46:43.444]  All you can get.
[01:46:43.644 --> 01:46:44.445]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:46:44.705 --> 01:46:47.466]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:46:47.766 --> 01:46:55.049]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:46:55.289 --> 01:46:56.310]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:46:57.150 --> 01:47:08.155]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:14.887 --> 01:47:27.934]  It's funny because when I tell people what I do for a living, the first response usually is, you're with the environmental police?
[01:47:27.954 --> 01:47:29.515]  There is no environment in New York City.
[01:47:29.755 --> 01:47:35.278]  With this new power, the Green Mafia can take over the entire economy through selective enforcement.
[01:47:35.728 --> 01:47:41.931]  We know, Madam Speaker, that this national energy tax will cost the American people $2 trillion.
[01:47:42.251 --> 01:47:42.912]  We know that.
[01:47:43.372 --> 01:47:50.356]  We know this will result in a loss of 2.5 million jobs every year for the American people.
[01:47:50.676 --> 01:47:51.376]  We know that.
[01:47:51.856 --> 01:47:56.139]  We know this will result in a reduced standard of living for Americans.
[01:47:56.599 --> 01:47:57.439]  We know that.
[01:47:57.979 --> 01:48:00.561]  What is the point and what's the benefit?
[01:48:01.243 --> 01:48:14.422]  The same central banks that have stolen more than 50 trillion from national treasuries across the planet are now creating a new derivatives fraud through the cap-and-trade carbon tax system that dwarfs their previous Ponzi schemes.
[01:48:15.305 --> 01:48:19.948]  We've just watched a financial meltdown in this country, the likes of which hasn't been seen in some time.
[01:48:20.389 --> 01:48:27.253]  Now, if people like credit default swaps, they're really going to like the carbon swaps that are going to occur and the carbon future swaps.
[01:48:27.694 --> 01:48:34.699]  We spent a full day in this committee last summer talking about the manipulation of the energy futures market in oil.
[01:48:36.383 --> 01:48:49.169]  We're going to create, I fear, another such system that people who have an inclination to react dishonestly to systems are going to actually have a new opportunity.
[01:48:49.309 --> 01:48:50.170]  Is that not a problem?
[01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:55.692]  A select group of central banks are lobbying for the same legislation to be passed worldwide.
[01:48:56.172 --> 01:49:03.556]  Once the so-called green economy laws are in place, only global megacorporations and their subsidiaries will be allowed to do business.
[01:49:05.322 --> 01:49:19.270]  Van Jones, Barack Obama's first green job czar, has stated repeatedly on the record that the new green economy is only a cover for a complete revolution against capitalism and the total redistribution of wealth.
[01:49:20.256 --> 01:49:34.685]  But what Van Jones doesn't tell his sad followers is that the elite are bragging that the modern green movement was designed from its creation to destroy the middle class and transfer all wealth into the hands of a super elite.
[01:49:35.185 --> 01:49:37.226]  They're not doing this to uplift the poor.
[01:49:37.647 --> 01:49:42.590]  No, the goal is to enslave the planet and usher in a new dark age.
[01:49:44.753 --> 01:49:52.530]  Every nation on earth is in the process of, or has already passed, its own set of carbon tax laws and regulations.
[01:49:53.351 --> 01:50:03.836]  If their plan is successful, every nation on Earth will not only pay tribute to the powerful world government, but every facet of human life will be regulated by the technocratic global planners.
[01:50:04.656 --> 01:50:13.820]  Under the carbon tax scheme, China, India, Mexico, and over 150 other nations are exempt from the global tax system.
[01:50:14.301 --> 01:50:18.022]  You see the bankers already own and control the third world.
[01:50:18.503 --> 01:50:21.204]  Their final target is the middle class of the West.
[01:50:22.831 --> 01:50:29.337]  Once they've dismantled the economies of the United States, Europe, and Japan, they believe no one can stand in their way.
[01:50:30.038 --> 01:50:34.422]  In short, the New World Order is a global corporate takeover.
[01:50:34.923 --> 01:50:41.429]  In their global corporate state, there is no room for individuality, sovereignty, or independence.
[01:50:43.593 --> 01:50:55.215]  As their program begins to face more and more opposition, lawmakers and supporters of the man-made global warming hypothesis want laws to be passed, making it illegal to question their theories.
[01:50:58.016 --> 01:51:11.719]  Recently, the head of Greenpeace was forced to admit that the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps grow in the winter and shrink in the summer, and that this is all part of a natural process driven by the tilt of the Earth and the Sun.
[01:51:14.056 --> 01:51:21.779]  The cosmic radiation coming from space, the amount reaching the Earth, is affected by the strength of the Sun's magnetic field.
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:28.642]  So the magnetic field of the Sun is almost like a gateway controlling the cosmic radiation reaching the Earth.
[01:51:30.383 --> 01:51:35.065]  The magnetic strength of the Sun is also related to the number of sunspots.
[01:51:35.866 --> 01:51:41.028]  So they are directly related to changes within the inner structure of the Sun.
[01:51:42.605 --> 01:51:49.388]  The amount of cosmic radiation reaching the lower atmosphere creates more cloud.
[01:51:49.909 --> 01:51:54.431]  And cloud forms you need to have what are called condensation nuclei.
[01:51:55.566 --> 01:52:04.309]  That is, little particles around which water can change from water vapor or gas into water droplets, minute particles that are visible in the form of clouds.
[01:52:05.009 --> 01:52:19.755]  We've known for a long time that there was more cloud than the amount of particles in the atmosphere, because we assumed it was clay particles and salt particles that were creating this condensation process.
[01:52:21.629 --> 01:52:22.790]  But there was this gap.
[01:52:23.650 --> 01:52:26.912]  We now realize, of course, it's the cosmic radiation that's doing it.
[01:52:27.512 --> 01:52:36.275]  What the cosmic radiation is doing, controlled by the magnetic field of the Sun, is putting up a... it's like putting up a screen in the greenhouse and blocking out the sunlight.
[01:52:37.396 --> 01:52:39.897]  And of course that then affects the temperature of the Earth.
[01:52:40.817 --> 01:52:45.419]  That's why there's a relationship between the sunspots and the temperature on the Earth.
[01:52:45.799 --> 01:52:47.300]  So we now know the mechanism.
[01:52:48.697 --> 01:52:50.239]  But they completely ignore that.
[01:52:50.619 --> 01:53:08.020]  More than 31,000 scientists from across the United States, including more than 9,000 PhDs from the fields of climatology, atmospheric science, earth science, and hydrology signed a petition rejecting man-made global warming as a scientific fraud.
[01:53:08.681 --> 01:53:14.906]  This shattered the hoax of the so-called consensus that the mainstream media had been pushing for years.
[01:53:15.287 --> 01:53:20.131]  That every scientist on Earth believed that man-made global warming was a fact.
[01:53:23.414 --> 01:53:30.280]  If the people are able to block their carbon tax takeover, the elite's agenda to establish a planetary world government will collapse.
[01:53:31.906 --> 01:53:39.851]  To force their unpopular agenda upon the planet, the controllers are racing to complete the construction of their police state control grid.
[01:53:40.572 --> 01:53:50.618]  Borrowing from tactics used in the past by communist, fascist, and other totalitarian regimes, every form of classical textbook tyranny is now being implemented in the West.
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:57.863]  In the United States, the central government is federalizing local police.
[01:54:00.205 --> 01:54:05.579]  State and local officers are in a great position to collect important information on terrorists and their allies.
[01:54:06.281 --> 01:54:08.707]  And the Terrorist Screening Center stands ready to help you.
[01:54:09.875 --> 01:54:15.578]  This video, produced by Homeland Security, is required viewing for all departments in the U.S.
[01:54:16.498 --> 01:54:25.583]  And with the teamwork of local, state, and federal law enforcement, we have an excellent opportunity to see the picture and solve the puzzle before these terrorists can strike again.
[01:54:26.543 --> 01:54:32.686]  State, county, and city police now take their marching orders directly from DHS and FEMA.
[01:54:33.367 --> 01:54:39.430]  The videos and training manuals turn peace officers, once guardians of the republic, into secret police.
[01:54:39.986 --> 01:54:40.787]  See way down there?
[01:54:41.547 --> 01:54:43.268]  There's a woman taking photos of the dam.
[01:54:45.009 --> 01:54:48.371]  Someone called 9-1-1 and reported a suspicious person.
[01:54:48.852 --> 01:54:51.293]  As you guessed, she's gonna be a Category 3 hit.
[01:54:51.834 --> 01:55:00.079]  And since it's very important that we don't let her know that we know, both the dispatcher and the officer need to make sure she doesn't hear the radio traffic.
[01:55:00.579 --> 01:55:00.959]  Stand by.
[01:55:00.979 --> 01:55:02.921]  If I could ask you to wait right here, please.
[01:55:02.941 --> 01:55:03.361]  Sure.
[01:55:07.446 --> 01:55:14.894]  Everyday items and activities are listed as proof that you are sympathizing with shadowy boogeymen of terror.
[01:55:16.095 --> 01:55:20.159]  Of course he's going to keep his eyes open for anything interesting or unusual in the car.
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:28.608]  That would include cameras, binoculars, video equipment, GPS, maybe things like sleeping bags that suggest they're living out of the car.
[01:55:29.417 --> 01:55:39.126]  From their inception, Homeland Security and NORTHCOM were set up to dominate the people and the states, not to fight the CIA-created Al Qaeda.
[01:55:41.268 --> 01:55:54.361]  Patriotic members of the military and law enforcement, at great risk to their lives and careers, have sent this filmmaker federally and internationally produced law enforcement manuals, textbooks, documents and videos.
[01:55:56.718 --> 01:56:05.207]  The MIAC report, distributed to Missouri law enforcement, lists gun owners, libertarians, constitutionalists as potential terrorists.
[01:56:05.548 --> 01:56:15.479]  The federally written document went on to list Ron Paul, Bob Barr, and American flag bumper stickers as dangerous paraphernalia linked to white supremacists.
[01:56:16.818 --> 01:56:27.094]  Even before 9-11, FEMA was quietly indoctrinating local police to have a hatred of the Founding Fathers and everything our constitutional republic stands for.
[01:56:27.675 --> 01:56:29.899]  Who was the first terrorist organization in the United States?
[01:56:32.546 --> 01:56:32.826]  Who?
[01:56:32.966 --> 01:56:33.987]  You mean Thomas Jefferson?
[01:56:34.027 --> 01:56:36.089]  You mean George Washington?
[01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:36.729]  Paul Revere?
[01:56:36.749 --> 01:56:39.792]  These guys right here... Let me ask you something.
[01:56:39.832 --> 01:56:41.753]  Did they try to scare people?
[01:57:05.104 --> 01:57:12.549]  In the old Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, and Maoist China, the police main job was not fighting crime.
[01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:19.094]  In totalitarian forms of government, the police are political enforcers, or commissars as they were known in Russia.
[01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:25.393]  It's their job to spy on the public and to intimidate the exercise of free speech.
[01:57:26.594 --> 01:57:31.997]  Once a climate of fear has been achieved, the public begins to self-censor, to shut down.
[01:57:33.078 --> 01:57:43.044]  Once the people have been intimidated to withdraw from the field of intellectual battle, the tyrants have a free hand to expand their oppression and looting of the helpless serfs.
