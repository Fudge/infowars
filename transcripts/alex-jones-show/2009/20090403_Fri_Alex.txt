[00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:00.970]  Impossible.
[00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.014]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:09.656]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:16.067 --> 00:00:19.591]  Alright folks, we are live and streaming at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:20.732]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:21.913]  I'm Jason Burmas sitting in.
[00:00:21.973 --> 00:00:23.554]  I do my own little show here on the network.
[00:00:23.574 --> 00:00:25.036]  It's called The Info Warrior.
[00:00:25.056 --> 00:00:26.677]  It airs from 9 to midnight.
[00:00:27.138 --> 00:00:30.982]  If you missed last night's show, I had Patrisse O'Neill on for about 90 minutes.
[00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:32.163]  He was an excellent guest.
[00:00:32.463 --> 00:00:36.167]  You can get the podcast over at TheInfoWarrior.com or you can check us out
[00:00:36.887 --> 00:00:46.438]  On the YouTube, we broadcast three hours of live TV over there, so I'll be doing five hours of TV and seven hours of radio today, really just covering all the top news.
[00:00:46.498 --> 00:00:52.826]  Really, the G20 is the biggest news in my mind, even though we have a massive shooting right outside of my hometown.
[00:00:53.146 --> 00:01:07.049]  And all this weird stuff happening in upstate New York lately from the Schenectady mayor wanting to declare martial law to this massive shooting at the American Civics Institute of people who have come to this country and legally, you know, want to become real citizens.
[00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:08.790]  I mean, people that go through the process.
[00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.010]  All right, we're going to take your calls.
[00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:18.272]  We're going to go to Ned, Michael, and Martin, but first I want to go to Thomas because he's in the UK and I know that's a big old phone bill.
[00:01:18.552 --> 00:01:19.232]  Thomas, what's up?
[00:01:21.613 --> 00:01:21.913]  Yes, sir.
[00:01:25.253 --> 00:01:26.013]  Thomas is he there?
[00:01:26.694 --> 00:01:28.134]  Going once, going twice.
[00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:29.035]  Yes, you there?
[00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:31.636]  Alright, let's go to Ned in Florida.
[00:01:31.676 --> 00:01:32.617]  Sorry, Thomas, I tried.
[00:01:32.637 --> 00:01:34.097]  Ned, are you on the line?
[00:01:35.898 --> 00:01:36.178]  Hello?
[00:01:36.558 --> 00:01:36.919]  Yes, sir.
[00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.740]  How are you doing, Jason?
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.280]  Good.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.440]  Good.
[00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:48.624]  You guys were just talking about what people can do, besides spreading the word, waking people up.
[00:01:50.475 --> 00:02:01.024]  Do you think that it would be a good idea to write our Congress people and the Senate and let them know where we stand and that we're fully aware of the plans?
[00:02:01.865 --> 00:02:05.027]  Well, I think that it's always good to have a coordinated effort.
[00:02:05.047 --> 00:02:07.349]  It doesn't hurt to call these organizations.
[00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.051]  You know, you call your local Congressman.
[00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:10.532]  One of my friends is big into that.
[00:02:10.572 --> 00:02:12.194]  He's been doing it for years and letting them know.
[00:02:12.234 --> 00:02:13.475]  I mean, that is an effective way.
[00:02:13.795 --> 00:02:15.316]  But I find that if you can find a
[00:02:16.932 --> 00:02:20.415]  A common letter that you and others can write up and agree upon.
[00:02:20.835 --> 00:02:25.119]  And they get, you know, hundreds or thousands of these faxes a day signed by different people.
[00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:27.080]  I think that that's the most effective.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.742]  But really, I mean, it's almost beyond that.
[00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:37.569]  I mean, we all know that the majority of our Congress and Senate are bought and paid for by these, you know, these lobbyists and special interest groups.
[00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:38.950]  So, you know, they don't care.
[00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.632]  I mean, they should be screaming bloody murder right now, Ned.
[00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:49.051]  Well, Ron Paul, I mean, you know, we've got him in there, and there's a couple others, Sanders and... I forgot the other guy's name.
[00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:55.775]  Yeah, because Sanders and Ron Paul are about the only ones out there currently in the Congress that are saying anything.
[00:02:56.915 --> 00:02:58.556]  And Sanders is a senator, by the way.
[00:02:58.616 --> 00:02:59.837]  I shouldn't say he's in the Congress.
[00:02:59.877 --> 00:03:00.217]  He's not.
[00:03:00.517 --> 00:03:01.078]  But yeah, I mean...
[00:03:01.838 --> 00:03:04.121]  Yeah, we just need to step up and mobilize, man.
[00:03:04.822 --> 00:03:09.948]  First of all, we have to say that even if they tell us to do something, we're not going to do it.
[00:03:09.988 --> 00:03:15.836]  I think there's going to be a big test on 9-11 this year now that GiveX passed, and it's officially a holiday.
[00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:18.098]  It's a National Day of Service and Remembrance.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:44.142]  going to be his youth brigade coming out party basically this national service corps is going to have memorials around the country for nine eleven you know for further politicizing this program and they're also going to be going undoing knocking talks and trying to recruit people people have to say no and we have to have counter demonstrations exposing people to the truth about nine eleven and the truth of what they're taking part of in this national uh... service corps which is just
[00:03:44.882 --> 00:03:45.662]  It's scary, man.
[00:03:45.963 --> 00:03:47.083]  All right, thank you for the call, Ned.
[00:03:47.323 --> 00:03:48.424]  Let's jump to the next caller.
[00:03:48.464 --> 00:03:50.144]  Let's go to Michael in Texas.
[00:03:50.184 --> 00:03:50.724]  Michael, you're up.
[00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:52.625]  Hello, Jason.
[00:03:52.645 --> 00:03:53.586]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:54.206]  You got it.
[00:03:54.226 --> 00:03:56.027]  I want to follow up on your last caller.
[00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.890]  I think the front lines are at the individual state capitals.
[00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.371]  I've been to many states here, 50 states.
[00:04:07.851 --> 00:04:12.153]  The Tenth Amendment resolutions that have been addressed are submitted in many states.
[00:04:12.193 --> 00:04:14.354]  People need to go to the capitol.
[00:04:15.425 --> 00:04:17.046]  And thank the sponsors of the bills.
[00:04:17.406 --> 00:04:18.127]  Talk to the people.
[00:04:19.167 --> 00:04:29.352]  Suggest that the representatives reach out to the county sheriffs in their district and get them involved in this.
[00:04:30.433 --> 00:04:33.995]  And just stay on that.
[00:04:34.035 --> 00:04:35.355]  We need to keep this up front.
[00:04:35.936 --> 00:04:37.857]  The many info warriors need to do that.
[00:04:38.057 --> 00:04:38.757]  Go to the capitals.
[00:04:38.797 --> 00:04:43.960]  The people that live in the state capitals of their state should go to their capital and
[00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.791]  Don't be afraid to approach
[00:05:00.222 --> 00:05:00.442]  I agree.
[00:05:00.502 --> 00:05:06.424]  Here in Austin, at the Rotunda, on the floor of the Capitol, right there in the center of the Rotunda, it says, the Republic of Texas.
[00:05:29.102 --> 00:05:30.603]  I mean, it's already there in stone.
[00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:45.569]  And, uh, you know, I think if we stay on these people and go to the co-sponsors also of the bill, you know, here in Texas, I think there's like 30, 30 or 35 co-sponsors and just go and thank them and have them reach out to their sheriffs and their districts.
[00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:50.872]  And the more, I mean, the county sheriffs is, is, you know, in the individual counties is where we're going to get the power at.
[00:05:51.492 --> 00:05:55.594]  And if we can get the sheriffs involved in this, I think that we can, can, uh,
[00:05:56.676 --> 00:05:59.839]  Well, Sheriff is usually an electable office.
[00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:03.561]  This is another example of how you can take back your government for and by the people.
[00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:07.504]  It's not just about running for Congress or state senator or city council member.
[00:06:07.564 --> 00:06:08.325]  Run for Sheriff!
[00:06:09.045 --> 00:06:09.966]  They're sovereign.
[00:06:10.386 --> 00:06:11.647]  They have power over the feds.
[00:06:12.268 --> 00:06:15.930]  They can kick them out of the county and not let them in.
[00:06:21.343 --> 00:06:31.670]  I just think we really, you know, we just can't sit, now that these bills, these resolutions have been introduced in these many states, we just can't sit back and let them, you know, let them sit there and pass through.
[00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.373]  We've got to get in there and show those representatives that they have a lot of people behind them.
[00:06:36.393 --> 00:06:38.915]  Michael, we definitely have to be more proactive in Show Initiative.
[00:06:38.955 --> 00:06:39.835]  I thank you for the call.
[00:06:40.436 --> 00:06:42.757]  Let's jump to Martin in California.
[00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:43.317]  Martin, you're up.
[00:06:43.718 --> 00:06:44.358]  Hey, Jason.
[00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:45.239]  How are you doing?
[00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:46.299]  Good.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.122]  Hey, I was listening a couple days ago about
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.002]  Everything going on in Sacramento.
[00:06:53.925 --> 00:07:00.274]  I'm really interested in journalism and things like that.
[00:07:00.294 --> 00:07:02.897]  I was wondering if you guys need an extra guy on the ground over there.
[00:07:02.917 --> 00:07:04.600]  I mean, I work for free.
[00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:12.555]  I mean, I'm the wrong guy to be talking to you about it because I'm not the one that coordinates, you know, where you would send the videos and whatnot.
[00:07:12.855 --> 00:07:23.540]  But if you're close to Sacramento and you want to do some reconnaissance work over on, you know, the tent cities and what's going on down there, I would contact Rob D. at InfoWars.com.
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.921]  Just go shoot it anyway.
[00:07:25.021 --> 00:07:26.282]  I mean, if it's good, we'll use it.
[00:07:26.322 --> 00:07:27.762]  That's basically what we do.
[00:07:27.782 --> 00:07:31.304]  And not only do we comb over YouTube and whatnot to see what's out there,
[00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:34.146]  But some people will have already done it and sent us.
[00:07:34.186 --> 00:07:35.447]  I mean, we can't report on everything.
[00:07:35.467 --> 00:07:36.408]  We can't take everything.
[00:07:36.768 --> 00:07:41.452]  But we do encourage people to become their own info warriors and, you know, do real journalism.
[00:07:42.093 --> 00:07:50.480]  By taking a camera, going and documenting the event, and then getting the people that it's affecting's opinions, you know, the people that are actually in there.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.622]  That's more journalism than 90% of the mainstream media is going to do anyway.
[00:07:54.682 --> 00:08:00.305]  So, you know, we encourage that type of behavior whether or not, you know, we'll definitely use it or I can coordinate it.
[00:08:00.365 --> 00:08:00.685]  I can't.
[00:08:00.986 --> 00:08:02.446]  RobD at Infowars.com.
[00:08:02.466 --> 00:08:03.607]  Martin, I thank you for the call.
[00:08:04.027 --> 00:08:05.648]  All right, let's jump to our next caller.
[00:08:05.668 --> 00:08:07.869]  Let's go to Denise in Illinois.
[00:08:07.889 --> 00:08:10.211]  You're up.
[00:08:10.231 --> 00:08:10.651]  Hey, Jason.
[00:08:10.671 --> 00:08:11.271]  How's it going?
[00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:11.791]  Good.
[00:08:13.072 --> 00:08:14.293]  So here's what I'm calling about.
[00:08:14.313 --> 00:08:18.375]  As an info warrior myself, I've been using Facebook
[00:08:18.993 --> 00:08:24.136]  To post as many things as I can possibly get my hands on from YouTube, from everywhere.
[00:08:24.156 --> 00:08:26.578]  I've taken some things from Alex.
[00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:30.460]  I put, you know, as much as I could.
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.462]  I have about 130 friends on my page.
[00:08:33.362 --> 00:08:41.467]  Do you know that about two of them have anything, no, any idea at all about what I'm talking about?
[00:08:42.028 --> 00:08:46.851]  They don't believe in the 9-11 conspiracies, which is actually not a conspiracy.
[00:08:46.891 --> 00:08:47.451]  It's the truth.
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:56.067]  They don't have any clue about so much, because I think music has gotten in people's minds so much.
[00:08:56.267 --> 00:08:58.108]  The television, music, the internet.
[00:08:58.569 --> 00:09:06.035]  They're keeping themselves so preoccupied with absolutely everything but the truth, because the truth, it's scary.
[00:09:06.115 --> 00:09:07.396]  Yeah, it is scary, you know?
[00:09:07.996 --> 00:09:17.044]  But I've been doing this for, I don't know, 10, 11, 12 years, looking up stuff, because when I was little,
[00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:21.544]  I remember some very odd things, you know, from my childhood.
[00:09:22.404 --> 00:09:30.630]  So I asked a man in my later years what the scars on my arms were and what all these different marks on my body are.
[00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:34.493]  And he gave me a book called The Biggest Conspiracy Theory Reader.
[00:09:35.413 --> 00:09:43.319]  Well, just yesterday, or the day before, on my Facebook page, I posted an MKUltra CIA video post
[00:09:44.048 --> 00:09:50.870]  And today, Facebook has sent me a message saying that if I continue to post, my page will be cancelled.
[00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.811]  Well, that is just terrible.
[00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:57.373]  I mean, that just illustrates the fact that, you know, they're trying to censor the Internet.
[00:09:57.653 --> 00:10:00.635]  And for those that don't know what MKUltra is, I thank you for the call, Denise.
[00:10:00.895 --> 00:10:07.199]  This is the Mind Control Ultra program that was semi-declassified during the 70s.
[00:10:07.219 --> 00:10:09.140]  You can read a lot of them on PDF files.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.822]  A lot of those files were destroyed, but I mean, it goes over everything from LSD to
[00:10:15.043 --> 00:10:16.745]  I mean, I don't even know how to describe it.
[00:10:16.845 --> 00:10:20.189]  Some people knew that they were going to be subjected to experiments, some people didn't.
[00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:29.320]  It's not only about LST, it's really about controlling the masses, it's about psychological warfare, it's about one of those nexus points that we talked about earlier.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.124]  Remember, if I were doing a class on New World Order 101,
[00:10:33.365 --> 00:10:39.027]  You know, the three main subjects would be, you know, the monetary system, perpetual debt, the Federal Reserve, things that are going on there.
[00:10:39.628 --> 00:10:43.709]  The eugenics programs, what's in the vaccinations, the foods, how they're dumbing us down.
[00:10:44.009 --> 00:10:45.790]  The third, of course, would be false flag terror.
[00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:51.572]  And, you know, the Hegelian dialectic, problem, reaction, solution, and how they motivate populations.
[00:10:51.652 --> 00:11:00.116]  And their three main modus operandi are, you know, think tanks, lobbyist groups, foundations, things like the CFR, the Bilderberg Group, those types of things.
[00:11:00.536 --> 00:11:10.386]  And then you have your government organizations, the NSA, the CIA, the FBI, you know, Continuative Government, the shadow government that's out there, and then of course the PSYOPs, Psychological Warfare.
[00:11:10.546 --> 00:11:16.172]  It's not a mistake that they found members of the CIA in the newsrooms of CNN.
[00:11:17.413 --> 00:11:22.736]  Most of your news is intelligence run by design.
[00:11:23.056 --> 00:11:28.720]  It is total and complete propaganda to keep you in the dark.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.401]  Do you understand?
[00:11:31.421 --> 00:11:32.202]  The talking point
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:38.065]  of a new world order in Bloomberg, in C-SPAN, in CNN.
[00:11:38.646 --> 00:11:39.667]  This is all by design.
[00:11:39.687 --> 00:11:40.908]  They're getting you used to the idea.
[00:11:40.948 --> 00:11:42.510]  Global government's here to stay, folks.
[00:11:42.991 --> 00:11:44.252]  And they just announced it at the G20.
[00:11:44.312 --> 00:11:46.094]  We're going to go to the rest of your calls.
[00:11:46.154 --> 00:11:48.256]  Danny, Michael, David, and more on the other side.

[00:14:02.781 --> 00:14:05.363]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:14:05.971 --> 00:14:08.095]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:14:08.576 --> 00:14:15.608]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:14:16.152 --> 00:14:22.337]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:14:22.357 --> 00:14:24.579]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:14:24.719 --> 00:14:27.141]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:14:27.221 --> 00:14:38.170]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:14:38.803 --> 00:14:40.083]  It's not about left or right.
[00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:41.844]  It's about a one world government.
[00:14:42.324 --> 00:14:48.686]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:14:57.488 --> 00:14:58.648]  The Obama Deception.
[00:14:59.069 --> 00:15:00.249]  The people strike back.
[00:15:02.834 --> 00:15:08.315]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:15:08.335 --> 00:15:08.876]  and the world.
[00:15:09.136 --> 00:15:12.597]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:15:12.997 --> 00:15:19.218]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:15:19.498 --> 00:15:21.279]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:29.461]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:15:29.741 --> 00:15:34.182]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:15:34.442 --> 00:15:39.984]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:15:40.264 --> 00:15:42.264]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:15:42.445 --> 00:15:45.805]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you, free of charge.
[00:15:46.126 --> 00:15:48.226]  Dial 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202, or visit our website at ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[00:15:55.128 --> 00:15:55.449]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:33.178]  Alright, folks, we are back.
[00:16:33.218 --> 00:16:34.259]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:16:34.279 --> 00:16:35.720]  We're going to continue to take your calls.
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.584]  But before we go to the next caller, I want to thank one of our great sponsors.
[00:16:41.104 --> 00:16:42.766]  It's HomeGain.com.
[00:16:42.806 --> 00:16:44.307]  That's HomeGain.com.
[00:16:44.347 --> 00:16:46.429]  Gain is in G-A-I-N.
[00:16:46.489 --> 00:16:50.552]  Here is the Home Gain monkey for all the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:16:50.612 --> 00:16:51.773]  Very lovable monkey.
[00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:52.393]  So what is
[00:16:53.314 --> 00:16:53.954]  HomeGain.
[00:16:53.974 --> 00:17:01.076]  This is a place where you can get started buying or selling a home, finding a realtor, or getting any real estate questions answered.
[00:17:01.376 --> 00:17:07.317]  All you need to do is type in your home address and you will get a free instant estimate of your home's value online.
[00:17:07.578 --> 00:17:11.418]  It's a great way to be able to value the monitor of your home, and again, it's free.
[00:17:11.519 --> 00:17:13.499]  It's HomeGain.com.
[00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:17.700]  That's HomeGain.com, and here is the Home Gain monkey.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.181]  We thank them so much for their support of this great program.
[00:17:22.901 --> 00:17:24.362]  All right, let's continue to go to your calls.
[00:17:24.622 --> 00:17:26.923]  I believe we are on Danny in Texas.
[00:17:27.023 --> 00:17:27.664]  Danny, you're up.
[00:17:29.745 --> 00:17:29.985]  Hello?
[00:17:30.385 --> 00:17:30.785]  Yes, sir.
[00:17:30.805 --> 00:17:33.086]  How you doing, Jason?
[00:17:33.407 --> 00:17:33.627]  Good.
[00:17:34.447 --> 00:17:34.687]  Good.
[00:17:35.228 --> 00:17:42.011]  Listen, I have an idea that was sparked this morning by an article that I read in Forbes Magazine.
[00:17:42.572 --> 00:17:43.252]  Okay.
[00:17:44.252 --> 00:17:50.536]  About some corporations who were watching a couple of cases
[00:17:51.309 --> 00:17:54.270]  That has to do with the RICO law.
[00:18:14.807 --> 00:18:17.468]  And I apologize, because I get so tongue-tied when I get on here.
[00:18:17.488 --> 00:18:20.770]  It seems like I can't think fast enough about what I need to say.
[00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:32.855]  But anyway, long story short, cut to the chase, what it hit me was that, I mean, we're desperate for a place to start to stop these people.
[00:18:33.855 --> 00:18:34.295]  Desperate.
[00:18:34.616 --> 00:18:42.499]  And what hit me was, well, you know, I happen to think that, why couldn't we go in with a
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.661]  I don't think so.
[00:18:58.988 --> 00:19:00.889]  Well, let's just look at that on it's face though.
[00:19:01.209 --> 00:19:06.012]  All class action lawsuits of any kind of like real financial stability take years and years and years.
[00:19:06.232 --> 00:19:07.653]  Man, we don't got years and years and years.
[00:19:07.893 --> 00:19:10.914]  They literally announced the new world order yesterday.
[00:19:11.255 --> 00:19:15.237]  They announced that they're no longer going to have these trade barriers.
[00:19:15.777 --> 00:19:19.799]  They announced they were going to go after third world countries that weren't in on the game.
[00:19:20.059 --> 00:19:21.019]  I mean, this is it, man.
[00:19:21.219 --> 00:19:26.161]  I mean, they announced three weeks ago that they were going to print up a global super currency for quantitative easing.
[00:19:26.401 --> 00:19:28.622]  And this is the establishment of it right here.
[00:19:28.842 --> 00:19:34.424]  So even if we sue these guys, first of all, it looks like they're putting us under an international court system.
[00:19:34.684 --> 00:19:39.766]  What we need to do is we need to say we need to put in instead of a civil court.
[00:19:40.666 --> 00:19:43.027]  We need to file legislation that we're not going to take part in this.
[00:19:43.307 --> 00:19:50.449]  For instance, there's a woman out of Minnesota, a congresswoman, who has filed a bill that says that the U.S.
[00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:53.030]  cannot drop the dollar as the world currency.
[00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.771]  She's against the global currency.
[00:19:54.831 --> 00:19:57.832]  It's basically a bill ensuring that the global currency doesn't come here.
[00:19:58.152 --> 00:19:59.473]  Or at least to the state of Minnesota.
[00:19:59.493 --> 00:20:00.153]  Will it get passed?
[00:20:00.193 --> 00:20:00.714]  Probably not.
[00:20:00.914 --> 00:20:02.314]  Has it gotten any immediate attention?
[00:20:02.375 --> 00:20:02.575]  No.
[00:20:02.855 --> 00:20:03.735]  But it's a step forward.
[00:20:03.755 --> 00:20:07.097]  I just think that civil cases probably aren't the way to go.
[00:20:07.137 --> 00:20:12.821]  I'm not discouraging people from trying something like that, but I feel like legislation is the better way.
[00:20:12.881 --> 00:20:13.941]  I thank you for the call, Danny.
[00:20:14.301 --> 00:20:16.563]  All right, let's go to Michael in Toronto.
[00:20:16.643 --> 00:20:17.483]  Michael, you're on the air.
[00:20:18.784 --> 00:20:19.044]  Hello.
[00:20:19.504 --> 00:20:19.865]  Yes, sir.
[00:20:20.885 --> 00:20:21.085]  Hey.
[00:20:21.365 --> 00:20:25.008]  First of all, I'm a big fan of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:25.108 --> 00:20:26.949]  I've seen all of the videos.
[00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.253]  You know, we're very, very, very much interested in everything you have to say.
[00:20:32.114 --> 00:20:37.218]  I'm a Canadian, and there are some substantial differences between the U.S.
[00:20:37.238 --> 00:20:48.467]  system and the Canadian system, and we've been largely socialist up here for a long period of time, and have national health care, and have, you know, been supported by our government.
[00:20:48.828 --> 00:20:54.993]  And I just have a couple questions about the differences, and hope that Canadians aren't getting a bad rap here.
[00:20:57.586 --> 00:21:00.989]  Our economy is great in comparison to the U.S.
[00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:08.214]  I mean, we've got a fairly stable real estate market, you know, a banking market.
[00:21:08.274 --> 00:21:09.495]  None of our banks have gone south.
[00:21:11.176 --> 00:21:12.417]  And I'm just curious.
[00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:19.022]  Part of the reason is that I've spent a good portion of my life supporting globalism in my job.
[00:21:19.883 --> 00:21:25.087]  I'm one of those guys who, when you call your bank and somebody in India answers, it's probably my fault.
[00:21:25.859 --> 00:21:26.760]  Well, hold on.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.302]  I'm going to hold you over, Michael.
[00:21:30.322 --> 00:21:33.484]  I want to get your perspective on why you were pro-globalism.
[00:21:33.764 --> 00:21:34.965]  I used to be pro-globalism.
[00:21:35.025 --> 00:21:35.806]  I'm thinking, great!
[00:21:36.226 --> 00:21:37.427]  We're going to harmonize the world.
[00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:38.367]  One world government.
[00:21:38.387 --> 00:21:39.168]  We're all going to be happy.
[00:21:39.188 --> 00:21:40.229]  It's going to be democracy.
[00:21:40.249 --> 00:21:41.209]  We're going to feed everybody.
[00:21:41.229 --> 00:21:42.030]  We're going to clothe everybody.
[00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:42.990]  Everybody's going to have a home.
[00:21:43.571 --> 00:21:46.073]  It's going to be democracy worldwide, but that's not their plan.
[00:21:46.413 --> 00:21:49.155]  When you look at what it really is, it's about eugenics and control.
[00:21:49.315 --> 00:21:50.295]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:21:50.315 --> 00:21:51.296]  We'll be back after this.
[00:21:51.536 --> 00:21:52.417]  Infowars.com.
[00:21:56.472 --> 00:21:59.144]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:02.276 --> 00:22:03.677]  So you want to stop smoking.
[00:22:03.737 --> 00:22:04.857]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[00:22:05.017 --> 00:22:07.778]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[00:22:07.898 --> 00:22:11.720]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.422]  And if and only if you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it?
[00:22:15.662 --> 00:22:17.603]  Most likely, if you try this, you'd be arrested.
[00:22:17.663 --> 00:22:21.604]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the Smokefree free trial offer is.
[00:22:21.985 --> 00:22:24.766]  Smokefree is a complete all-natural stop smoking system.
[00:22:24.886 --> 00:22:27.567]  And when you call today, they'll send you a 30-day supply of the program.
[00:22:27.867 --> 00:22:28.728]  Absolutely free!

[00:22:45.282 --> 00:22:48.204]  Join the tens of thousands who have quit for life with Smokefree.

[00:22:49.204 --> 00:22:51.105]  This is a limited time offer, so call 1-800-426-6186 now.
[00:22:51.125 --> 00:22:52.886]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:23:05.746 --> 00:23:07.887]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:08.588 --> 00:23:13.931]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:23:14.471 --> 00:23:20.655]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:23:20.955 --> 00:23:22.796]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:23:22.936 --> 00:23:25.338]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:23:25.398 --> 00:23:35.144]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[00:23:35.604 --> 00:23:36.325]  That's fascist.
[00:23:38.586 --> 00:23:39.867]  It's not about left or right.
[00:23:40.247 --> 00:23:41.648]  It's about a one world government.
[00:23:42.108 --> 00:23:48.432]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:23:57.277 --> 00:23:58.438]  The Obama Deception.
[00:23:58.838 --> 00:24:00.119]  The people strike back.
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.362]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[00:24:04.989 --> 00:24:07.951]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:11.732]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[00:24:12.093 --> 00:24:18.296]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[00:24:18.676 --> 00:24:23.718]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[00:24:23.899 --> 00:24:30.622]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[00:24:30.922 --> 00:24:31.803]  Need something more?
[00:24:32.004 --> 00:24:35.668]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.

[00:25:29.289 --> 00:25:31.410]  Alright, folks, we are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:32.151]  I'm Jason Burmess.
[00:25:32.231 --> 00:25:41.156]  Remember, I do a show nine to midnight, five nights a week, central time here at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[00:25:42.337 --> 00:25:48.780]  Michael, you were saying, you know, you were the guy at the bank that sent you overseas to somebody else, and you were pro-globalism.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.761]  Why don't you expand on that?
[00:25:50.281 --> 00:25:51.462]  Well, not precisely.
[00:25:52.062 --> 00:25:54.124]  I'm part of a consulting group that
[00:25:55.496 --> 00:25:58.838]  Essentially, it looks at jobs in the U.S.
[00:25:59.098 --> 00:26:08.783]  and Canada that are typically unwanted and economically not viable for most people in this country.
[00:26:10.564 --> 00:26:23.430]  We look at options for corporations to be able to find an alternative for shareholders in order to reduce costs and hopefully pass some of those savings on to consumers in America on Main Street.
[00:26:24.779 --> 00:26:36.522]  This has been going on for a long time, and I'm not being critical of the globalization issue.
[00:26:36.842 --> 00:26:45.185]  I do understand that there needs to be certain people in charge of it, but my point is that globalization in itself is not a bad idea.
[00:26:45.205 --> 00:26:49.746]  The people who are in charge of it and their intent, absolutely.
[00:26:50.219 --> 00:27:01.319]  Can influence the outcome of that, but by fear of some of the rhetoric that goes on the internet and elsewhere about globalization.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.442]  It's actually going to, you know, take us away from the benefits of it.
[00:27:05.462 --> 00:27:06.503]  I absolutely agree.
[00:27:06.543 --> 00:27:07.723]  What are the benefits of it?
[00:27:07.743 --> 00:27:08.444]  That's what I want to know.
[00:27:08.464 --> 00:27:10.725]  The benefits of globalization are really, really simple.
[00:27:11.145 --> 00:27:22.751]  Other than sharing information, you know, openly and freely sharing information, I feel like, you know, obviously there are certain things that you'll have to import or export from places because you just can't get them anywhere else.
[00:27:23.012 --> 00:27:28.455]  But it seems like you can almost build infrastructure anywhere within countries.
[00:27:28.575 --> 00:27:29.095]  But go ahead.
[00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:31.456]  Yeah, no, no, I totally agree.
[00:27:31.476 --> 00:27:43.467]  I think the issue is when you take a look at war and you take a look at the things we've been fighting over for, you know, centuries, which involve territory, a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:27:43.507 --> 00:27:47.390]  It's all been about people living.
[00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:54.416]  It's been about people being able to say, hey, I can go to the store, I can buy stuff, I have some kind of capital or some kind of currency.
[00:27:54.912 --> 00:28:05.441]  That I can go and do stuff with, and I agree that there's issues with the currency and the way that it's controlled, but at the end of the day, cooperation amongst people is critical for the world.
[00:28:06.281 --> 00:28:17.731]  And this is the delineator that I see between the truth movement and, you know, the powers that be, which probably are quite evil and have ill intent.
[00:28:18.511 --> 00:28:19.232]  I don't deny that.
[00:28:20.093 --> 00:28:23.956]  What I'm saying is, unless people on the right side of the movement
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.180]  I don't
[00:28:39.062 --> 00:28:43.566]  Then we're in bigger trouble than we are with these guys at the top.
[00:28:57.438 --> 00:28:57.798]  That's right.
[00:29:19.626 --> 00:29:26.850]  This is the reason that people were given AIDS in this country and yours through Factor VIII injections from Bayer and nothing is done.
[00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:34.215]  It's because when you listen to somebody who's not even at the top like Ted Turner talking about a sustainable community and globalism, it means killing a bunch of us.
[00:29:34.475 --> 00:29:35.255]  I thank you for the call.
[00:29:35.295 --> 00:29:40.318]  That's my biggest fear is that this eugenics and this sustainability is in part with globalism.
[00:29:42.339 --> 00:29:44.922]  Am I against building a more global internet?
[00:29:45.522 --> 00:29:46.563]  Not as long as it's free.
[00:29:46.903 --> 00:29:50.547]  You know, I would love to have more communications with people overseas.
[00:29:50.567 --> 00:29:53.730]  You know, a decoder or, you know, a language translator.
[00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:56.192]  You know, not have to use Rosetta Stone to understand everything.
[00:29:56.212 --> 00:29:58.093]  I would love all that stuff, but is it plausible?
[00:29:58.854 --> 00:30:02.497]  And when you see what their steps are, it's just like a, you know, zeitgeist addendum.
[00:30:03.598 --> 00:30:07.202]  In the second half of that, he's talking about all these great technologies that do exist.
[00:30:07.967 --> 00:30:11.831]  You know, wind, solar, electromagnetics, all that stuff's real.
[00:30:12.351 --> 00:30:17.857]  But the elite aren't going to give it to us en masse until they can control it and make a profit on it.
[00:30:18.823 --> 00:30:24.967]  And really have consolidated their power in such a way that there are less of us to consume that stuff, because they don't want challenges to their power.
[00:30:25.348 --> 00:30:33.113]  I mean, on the surface, Addendum looks like this one-world society where we're all going to love each other, but when you start getting into it, they want a one-world hive mind.
[00:30:33.333 --> 00:30:35.034]  Watch the World Wide Mind out of PBS.
[00:30:35.074 --> 00:30:37.276]  It gives you a good idea of what they want there.
[00:30:37.676 --> 00:30:43.540]  You know, all of us with a brain chip, you know, in cyberspace, communicating each other telepathically.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.842]  I mean, this is really what they discuss.
[00:30:46.522 --> 00:30:51.325]  And if you think that's going to be for the general populace because they love us so much, it's not.
[00:30:51.805 --> 00:30:54.207]  You know, they want to offer us this utopia globalism.
[00:30:54.267 --> 00:30:55.788]  It's not what they have in mind for us.
[00:30:56.108 --> 00:30:57.509]  And you know what they do have in mind for us?
[00:30:57.529 --> 00:31:00.510]  This story is over at PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[00:31:01.191 --> 00:31:02.652]  I almost forgot to talk about it.
[00:31:02.672 --> 00:31:05.473]  This is a document out of New York State, nonetheless.
[00:31:05.633 --> 00:31:06.714]  All this stuff out of New York.
[00:31:07.514 --> 00:31:07.735]  April 4, 2007.
[00:31:07.795 --> 00:31:09.336]  So this document is about two years old.
[00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:20.214]  They're in the process of updating and collecting some very important information to our database regarding bio-attacks and massive disasters.
[00:31:20.234 --> 00:31:25.276]  You see, this is to cemeteries seeing if they can house massive graves.
[00:31:25.836 --> 00:31:26.937]  We're talking 950 people per acre.
[00:31:26.957 --> 00:31:27.937]  Let me repeat that.
[00:31:27.957 --> 00:31:28.697]  950 dead bodies per acre.
[00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:39.740]  And they're talking about thousands and thousands of acres and they want to know whether these cemeteries can hold all these people.
[00:31:40.041 --> 00:31:43.621]  Why are they getting ready for mass death if they don't have it in mind for us?
[00:31:44.001 --> 00:31:45.182]  I don't think they're killing themselves.
[00:31:45.822 --> 00:31:47.982]  All these people that say there are too many people in the world right here.
[00:31:48.322 --> 00:31:51.683]  Look, this is that Clinton administration official.
[00:31:52.183 --> 00:31:53.283]  Someone under Hillary right here.
[00:31:54.223 --> 00:31:56.824]  Earth's population already exceeds limits.
[00:31:57.204 --> 00:31:57.244]  Oh!
[00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:03.771]  Oh, and the reason we have all this global warming, too many people doing too much stuff according to Ted Turner.
[00:32:03.792 --> 00:32:05.012]  We're going to turn to cannibals.
[00:32:05.332 --> 00:32:08.033]  Eight degrees hotter, no crops, nuclear war.
[00:32:09.373 --> 00:32:09.913]  Ridiculous.
[00:32:09.973 --> 00:32:13.034]  It's all an excuse to bring in this globalist agenda.
[00:32:14.174 --> 00:32:15.415]  All right, let's go to our next caller.
[00:32:15.455 --> 00:32:17.415]  Let's go to David in Indiana.
[00:32:17.455 --> 00:32:18.296]  David, you're on the line.
[00:32:19.576 --> 00:32:20.276]  Yeah, hello.
[00:32:21.136 --> 00:32:21.457]  Hello.
[00:32:22.197 --> 00:32:22.557]  Yes, sir.
[00:32:24.037 --> 00:32:26.378]  Yeah, I've been an info warrior now for about 12 years.
[00:32:27.415 --> 00:32:33.439]  And the first film I've seen 12 years ago was by David Wagner called Barbed Wire Over America.
[00:32:35.019 --> 00:32:46.066]  And basically that's when I realized that everything that I've been taught in public school and everything that I've had as my belief system was basically false.
[00:32:47.046 --> 00:32:54.991]  And that public school is nothing but an instrument of mind control to brainwash young people and that's what
[00:32:55.946 --> 00:32:59.967]  Obama, he's gonna use that national service just like Hitler did.
[00:33:00.894 --> 00:33:07.535]  He's going to use it the same way Hitler did, and basically have a Hitler Youth Corps.
[00:33:07.975 --> 00:33:11.136]  I totally agree with you, and I think people need to understand this.
[00:33:11.476 --> 00:33:17.877]  You know, whereas in George Bush and his administration, when they wanted people to get behind them, they didn't use Bush as an image.
[00:33:17.917 --> 00:33:19.738]  They used the flag after 9-11.
[00:33:19.958 --> 00:33:23.318]  And everybody saw the red, white, and blue all over, and that was their symbol.
[00:33:23.338 --> 00:33:27.499]  What's really scary is with this guy, with Obama, it's not the flag they're using.
[00:33:27.819 --> 00:33:29.040]  It's the Obama logo.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.020]  It's his face.
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:31.021]  It's his swagger.
[00:33:31.101 --> 00:33:31.881]  It's his attitude.
[00:33:32.321 --> 00:33:38.404]  It's literally a youth that is being indoctrinated, not into an idea, but into a person.
[00:33:38.884 --> 00:33:43.166]  And I can't agree with you more that, you know, these schools are nothing but indoctrination centers.
[00:33:43.206 --> 00:33:45.287]  And it is a real big kick to the chest.
[00:33:45.327 --> 00:33:51.450]  It knocks the wind out of you when you start to realize how much brainwashing has gone on in your individual life.
[00:33:54.042 --> 00:33:56.404]  Yeah, and Obama, he's nothing but a demagogue.
[00:33:56.444 --> 00:34:00.446]  He's parading around like he's the champion of the common people, the middle class.
[00:34:01.026 --> 00:34:03.348]  And he's just another agent of the New World Order.
[00:34:03.408 --> 00:34:07.391]  He's finishing the job that George W. Bush didn't finish.
[00:34:07.991 --> 00:34:13.094]  He's giving this economy the final shove over the cliff so they can starve us into submission.
[00:34:13.655 --> 00:34:17.377]  Because what they're going to do in this country, they're going to try to starve us into submission
[00:34:18.089 --> 00:34:24.254]  With fear and with bad economics and all them tactics to get us to go along with their program.
[00:34:24.294 --> 00:34:31.419]  Well, they're offering, and I thank you for the call, they're offering full-time service through this Give Act for those people who don't have jobs that want to join.
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.161]  So this is going to be the new jobs.
[00:34:33.181 --> 00:34:35.883]  You know, it's not just the Department of Homeland Security that's going to expand.
[00:34:35.943 --> 00:34:37.044]  It's not just the Youth Corps.
[00:34:37.324 --> 00:34:40.427]  It's these jobs for national service.
[00:34:41.587 --> 00:34:42.968]  Full-time volunteerism.
[00:34:43.803 --> 00:34:49.187]  Well, you can't be a full-time volunteer without some kind of an income, so obviously this isn't really going to be volunteerism.
[00:34:49.227 --> 00:34:54.952]  It's going to be new bureaucracies set up to worship this administration and its ideals.
[00:34:55.012 --> 00:34:56.093]  I mean, that's the bottom line.
[00:34:56.473 --> 00:34:57.754]  All right, let's jump to our next caller.
[00:34:57.794 --> 00:34:59.316]  Let's go to Juan in New York.
[00:34:59.396 --> 00:35:00.156]  Juan, you're on the line.
[00:35:01.217 --> 00:35:01.838]  Hey, Jason.
[00:35:01.878 --> 00:35:02.458]  What's going on?
[00:35:02.838 --> 00:35:03.219]  How you doing?
[00:35:03.879 --> 00:35:04.240]  All right.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:13.027]  I mean, I called because, you know, I'm trying to do the right thing here and disseminate information amongst people that I know.
[00:35:14.301 --> 00:35:17.802]  And uh, you know, just the people at work and my family members.
[00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:24.305]  It seems that, you know, the mainstream media has really got these people's minds in a stranglehold.
[00:35:24.965 --> 00:35:39.230]  Every time I, when I talk to like an older individual at work, he tells me, you know, he's receptive to some of my ideas, but then he reversed to the, uh, to the Limbaugh line that it's all the Democrats doing this.
[00:35:39.731 --> 00:35:40.671]  And I keep trying to,
[00:35:41.457 --> 00:35:44.960]  Uh, come across the people by telling them they're both the same people.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:45.701]  You can't tell.
[00:35:46.161 --> 00:35:50.725]  I mean, uh, I just need some, I just need some guidance.
[00:35:51.052 --> 00:35:53.032]  You need some ammo for the Info War, right?
[00:35:53.573 --> 00:35:55.533]  How do I break this left-right paradigm?
[00:35:55.593 --> 00:36:00.674]  How do I tell them that both the Democrats and the Republicans are controlled without them scoffing at me?
[00:36:00.734 --> 00:36:03.255]  First of all, you're probably at a disadvantage because you're a younger guy.
[00:36:03.275 --> 00:36:04.335]  You sound like a younger guy.
[00:36:04.675 --> 00:36:07.196]  And everybody who's older, they already think they know it all.
[00:36:07.216 --> 00:36:10.277]  They don't want some young punk telling them what's going on.
[00:36:10.677 --> 00:36:11.337]  What I would do
[00:36:11.937 --> 00:36:12.337]  I think so.
[00:36:33.234 --> 00:36:36.839]  Try to explain to the guy that Clinton was brought up by Bush Sr.
[00:36:36.919 --> 00:36:40.864]  He ran cocaine for him in the 80s through the Iran-Contra scandal.
[00:36:41.024 --> 00:36:42.686]  You've got to break these barrier lines.
[00:36:42.806 --> 00:36:49.014]  I think that YouTube videos and movies, since nobody reads anymore, really do speak the best language.
[00:36:49.034 --> 00:36:50.555]  But if you're talking to some older people...
[00:36:51.937 --> 00:37:05.308]  I just, I don't have it here in front of me, but there was this CFR document from May of 2008 laying out this entire plan for global governance, basically all the economic stuff that just happened to the G20 and explained to him, hey, this is an organization of both sides.
[00:37:05.668 --> 00:37:07.310]  They predicted this thing was going to happen.
[00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:08.150]  They engineered it.
[00:37:08.471 --> 00:37:09.852]  It's right here in black and white.
[00:37:09.932 --> 00:37:11.153]  Please take the time to read it.
[00:37:11.453 --> 00:37:12.494]  You just got to be persistent.
[00:37:12.554 --> 00:37:15.657]  Not everybody's going to turn around in a day or a week or a month or a year.
[00:37:15.937 --> 00:37:17.158]  Sometimes it takes a long time.
[00:37:17.198 --> 00:37:18.159]  I thank you for the call, Juan.
[00:37:18.599 --> 00:37:21.200]  All right, let's jump to Chris in Louisiana.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.340]  Chris, you're online.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.340]  Hi, how you doing?
[00:37:24.621 --> 00:37:25.021]  Good, man.
[00:37:26.481 --> 00:37:33.163]  Look, I just wanted to call, I was calling, I've watched Endgames and the Obama deception recently.
[00:37:33.183 --> 00:37:33.763]  Uh-huh.
[00:37:34.683 --> 00:37:44.465]  And they really opened up my eyes to a lot of things that I see going on in the management of our natural resources here in South Louisiana.
[00:37:45.086 --> 00:37:45.206]  Mm-hmm.
[00:37:47.648 --> 00:37:55.386]  I'm wondering, like, what is it that someone that lives in South Louisiana can do to curtail some of this raping of the environment?
[00:37:55.745 --> 00:37:59.607]  Well, first of all, you've got to find out what legislation is passed in your area.
[00:37:59.627 --> 00:38:09.233]  You know, in Tennessee, they're already putting in this $2 billion carbon credit system because they believe the carbon credit is inevitable and we're going to have it.
[00:38:09.253 --> 00:38:10.593]  So you have to fight things like that.
[00:38:10.853 --> 00:38:16.216]  You know, when they're trying to tax you on the flatulence of your cattle or your livestock.
[00:38:16.236 --> 00:38:20.279]  Yeah, that's a big issue in South Vermilion Parish here.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:32.085]  Well, you have to get some... You're a constituent of these other people, so you have to get a local representative, somebody in your Congress or State Senate, to propose some kind of legislation that's going to help you.
[00:38:32.365 --> 00:38:33.246]  And then you have to publicize.
[00:38:33.266 --> 00:38:34.566]  You have to get your neighbors on board.
[00:38:34.587 --> 00:38:36.547]  You have to say, look, this is really what they're doing.
[00:38:36.768 --> 00:38:44.331]  I mean, they just passed another bill, this big Land Grab Act, which was an amalgamation of 160 other conservation bills.
[00:38:44.711 --> 00:38:49.714]  In this G20 communique, they openly state that climate change is irreversible.
[00:38:50.074 --> 00:38:50.154]  And
[00:39:09.804 --> 00:39:10.504]  Get behind it.
[00:39:10.704 --> 00:39:12.485]  Go to your city council meeting.
[00:39:12.805 --> 00:39:14.226]  Go say, this is what we want.
[00:39:14.286 --> 00:39:15.286]  Go vote on these things.
[00:39:15.647 --> 00:39:17.287]  Just become more proactive.
[00:39:17.507 --> 00:39:20.309]  You'd be surprised what you can do when you leave your house.
[00:39:20.349 --> 00:39:21.449]  I thank you for the call, Juan.
[00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:23.330]  That was Chris, I'm sorry.
[00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:24.410]  I thank you for the call, Chris.
[00:39:24.691 --> 00:39:26.952]  Let's jump to Brad in New Hampshire.
[00:39:26.972 --> 00:39:27.652]  Brad, you're on the line.
[00:39:28.332 --> 00:39:29.233]  Hey, how you doing, Jason?
[00:39:29.533 --> 00:39:29.753]  Good.
[00:39:30.893 --> 00:39:34.735]  I'd just like to touch base on what you were saying about population control.
[00:39:35.255 --> 00:39:39.257]  I don't think people get the magnitude of what these people are about to do.
[00:39:40.009 --> 00:39:42.671]  I mean, they want to kill 80% of us.
[00:39:43.412 --> 00:39:45.534]  And you know, this is no delusion, nothing crazy.
[00:39:45.894 --> 00:39:47.656]  I mean, they've stated it in their documents.
[00:39:48.196 --> 00:39:52.600]  Alex has said it a million times, you've said it a million times, but people still don't get it.
[00:39:55.356 --> 00:40:02.305]  We can play video clip after video clip of all these people talking about a sustainable society, talking about how there's too many people in the world already.
[00:40:02.826 --> 00:40:04.048]  I don't know what doesn't click.
[00:40:04.468 --> 00:40:07.893]  Look, they put AIDS in the Factor VIII.
[00:40:07.993 --> 00:40:12.679]  They put cancer viruses, SV40, in the polio vaccines.
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:13.620]  We're good to go.
[00:40:37.034 --> 00:40:40.338]  And they're cutting it with a poisonous heavy metal called mercury.
[00:40:40.619 --> 00:40:41.179]  I don't know.
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:42.741]  You gotta be brain dead.
[00:40:42.761 --> 00:40:47.027]  I mean, we almost had this argument with Tarpley at one point when he was here, you know.
[00:40:47.447 --> 00:40:49.951]  Oh, there's a boogeyman behind every corner, Tarpley.
[00:40:49.971 --> 00:40:52.073]  I go, listen, Tarpley, it's not a mistake.
[00:40:52.634 --> 00:40:59.516]  That they send out a bird flu vaccination to 14 other nations and it's killing a ferret.
[00:41:12.839 --> 00:41:14.720]  Well, Jason, here's another point I'd like to make.
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.501]  I was living in Hampton, New Hampshire, and right next to Hampton is the Seabrook Power Plant.
[00:41:38.189 --> 00:41:44.390]  And every night, all of a sudden, I'd see a helicopter light flashing out on the edge of a place called Boar's Head.
[00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:45.891]  They'd fire a flare.
[00:41:46.491 --> 00:41:50.551]  They'd square around the flare a few times and then just take off.
[00:41:51.532 --> 00:41:55.152]  And I saw this night after night after night for months.
[00:41:55.873 --> 00:42:00.193]  And then maybe a year later, I was driving through Portsmouth at night with my girlfriend.
[00:42:00.213 --> 00:42:01.834]  Somebody actually saw it with me for once.
[00:42:03.703 --> 00:42:05.624]  All of a sudden, I see this helicopter light come on.
[00:42:05.845 --> 00:42:09.327]  You know, there was nothing in the sky, and all of a sudden, the flashing light and the red light come on.
[00:42:09.808 --> 00:42:14.591]  They fire a flare, and this was right over the old Air Force base that we had up here.
[00:42:14.611 --> 00:42:15.172]  Mm-hmm.
[00:42:15.752 --> 00:42:16.833]  So what do you suspect this is?
[00:42:18.975 --> 00:42:19.335]  I don't know.
[00:42:19.355 --> 00:42:28.982]  I think they're checking wind direction for a possible attack on the Seabrook plant, or... You know, I just think it's funny that they would do something like this near the Seabrook plant.
[00:42:30.003 --> 00:42:30.243]  Mm-hmm.
[00:42:30.323 --> 00:42:31.124]  Oh, that sounds interesting, yeah.
[00:42:32.605 --> 00:42:38.587]  You know, that's usually the prevailing wind in the direction which they shot it from, which is usually a southwest wind sweeping across that way.
[00:42:39.287 --> 00:42:40.447]  Brad, I thank you for the call.
[00:42:40.487 --> 00:42:41.567]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:42:41.587 --> 00:42:42.608]  We'll be back after this.
[00:42:42.648 --> 00:42:45.508]  We're live right now, folks, over at ThePrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:42:45.548 --> 00:42:48.489]  Get a membership, watch the Obama Deception, Fabled Enemies, today!
[00:42:48.889 --> 00:42:49.269]  And this!
[00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:51.370]  Back after this, InfoWars.com.
[00:43:02.748 --> 00:43:04.190]  Are you embarrassed by your legs?
[00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:06.292]  Are your legs sore and irritated?
[00:43:06.573 --> 00:43:09.777]  Millions of women suffer from leg pain due to varicose veins.
[00:43:10.037 --> 00:43:14.683]  When varicose veins prevent you from living and enjoying your everyday life, you need VaniLuxe.
[00:43:14.983 --> 00:43:20.250]  VaniLuxe is a dietary tool formulated to restore naturally beautiful legs from the inside out.
[00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:28.332]  As part of your healthy lifestyle, Vaniolux promotes antioxidant action throughout your body to calm varicose veins and support fit legs for life.
[00:43:28.613 --> 00:43:34.414]  Vaniolux has helped women all over the world relieve varicose vein pain and restore the confidence to bare their legs.

[00:43:39.936 --> 00:43:42.318]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:44:05.712 --> 00:44:07.837]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:44:08.338 --> 00:44:15.392]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:44:15.916 --> 00:44:22.102]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:22.442 --> 00:44:24.324]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:24.464 --> 00:44:26.886]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:44:26.967 --> 00:44:37.937]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:44:38.547 --> 00:44:39.827]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:40.207 --> 00:44:41.608]  It's about a one world government.
[00:44:42.068 --> 00:44:48.390]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:56.772]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:44:57.232 --> 00:44:58.392]  The Obama Deception.
[00:44:58.813 --> 00:45:00.013]  The people strike back.
[00:45:01.946 --> 00:45:12.034]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:45:12.514 --> 00:45:13.575]  Garden in a can!

[00:45:35.154 --> 00:45:37.015]  Fresh, healthy, easy.
[00:45:37.555 --> 00:45:41.498]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[00:45:41.898 --> 00:45:42.798]  Ready when you are.

[00:45:53.565 --> 00:45:53.605]  866-598-7396.
[00:46:18.417 --> 00:46:19.939]  We are back!
[00:46:20.099 --> 00:46:24.845]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:46:24.945 --> 00:46:27.488]  I'm Jason Burmas sitting in.
[00:46:28.129 --> 00:46:29.671]  Looking for a love train, folks!
[00:46:35.417 --> 00:46:35.618]  Hey!
[00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:42.011]  See, if that was what globalism was all about, I'd be all about it.
[00:46:42.031 --> 00:46:44.492]  We'd be joining hands, we'd be a big disco party.
[00:46:44.752 --> 00:46:46.172]  That's not what globalism is about.
[00:46:46.192 --> 00:46:55.476]  It's about people, like, their hands turning yellow as they die and they cough things up and they realize that they've been poisoned by the eugenicists, by the globalists.
[00:46:55.556 --> 00:46:56.276]  That's what it's about.
[00:46:56.296 --> 00:46:58.817]  I wanna play this clip.
[00:46:59.858 --> 00:47:03.485]  Coming up at the 8 after break, I'll do a little intro into it.
[00:47:03.545 --> 00:47:06.450]  Max Keiser was on Paris TV and it's a long clip.
[00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:09.615]  We're probably going to play the whole thing because everything he says is relative.
[00:47:09.856 --> 00:47:12.540]  He not only brings up the controlled coup d'etat,
[00:47:13.626 --> 00:47:16.069]  through the financial institutions that just happened.
[00:47:16.529 --> 00:47:21.314]  But he relates it to 9-11 and the collapse of Building 7 and the Twin Towers.
[00:47:22.255 --> 00:47:24.718]  Basically, it's the controlled demolition coup d'etat.
[00:47:25.018 --> 00:47:28.041]  And that article is over at theinfowarrior.com.
[00:47:28.082 --> 00:47:30.784]  We do about, you know, we do one or two blogs a day over there.
[00:47:31.385 --> 00:47:39.048]  I'll try to hit up the important information, but Max Keiser killed, and he killed so much that we're going to be having him on the Jones Show, I believe, on Monday.
[00:47:39.428 --> 00:47:46.931]  He'll be joining us, and then he'll be on my program, The Info Warrior, which is the nighttime program, 9 to 12 Central, on Wednesday.
[00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:48.471]  Very important stuff.
[00:47:48.591 --> 00:47:54.994]  All right, let's take a couple calls in this final segment of the third hour, and then we're going to go right into the fourth hour.
[00:47:55.874 --> 00:47:57.155]  And Max Keiser's clip.
[00:47:57.175 --> 00:48:00.497]  I mean, folks, he breaks it down so eloquently.
[00:48:00.757 --> 00:48:05.320]  And when I heard him say it was a controlled demolition coup d'etat, I just could not.
[00:48:05.501 --> 00:48:07.082]  He's like, this is all being controlled.
[00:48:07.122 --> 00:48:08.282]  I don't think you understand.
[00:48:08.302 --> 00:48:09.243]  They're gutting the dollar.
[00:48:09.263 --> 00:48:12.966]  I don't want to do a bad impersonation of him, but he's got that kind of a voice.
[00:48:13.326 --> 00:48:13.506]  All right.
[00:48:13.526 --> 00:48:16.788]  Let's go to, I believe we are on Joshua in California.
[00:48:17.389 --> 00:48:17.949]  Josh, you're up.
[00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:19.630]  Oh, hey, Jason.
[00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.950]  Wow.
[00:48:20.311 --> 00:48:21.351]  I've been calling him for a while.
[00:48:22.972 --> 00:48:23.152]  Yeah.
[00:48:24.772 --> 00:48:28.175]  I really appreciate everything that you guys are doing.
[00:48:28.715 --> 00:48:34.499]  It's interesting, like, my dad, Roger Friedman, was on the Brady Plan.
[00:48:35.019 --> 00:48:36.580]  He wrote The Brain Trust for it.
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:47.227]  He was, like, best friends with Peter Grace, and one of the founders of the Bilderberg Group, and head of the Knights of Malta, and had, like, a really, well, interesting childhood.
[00:48:47.247 --> 00:48:51.330]  I'm not going to get into all that, but, yeah, I mean, you were talking about the eugenics and stuff.
[00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:52.211]  It's just crazy.
[00:48:52.431 --> 00:48:53.872]  I read the Medical Apartheid book.
[00:48:54.851 --> 00:49:03.377]  I'm here in Southern California and I listen to your show every day because I have a home office and it's totally like you said.
[00:49:03.397 --> 00:49:12.023]  I mean I'm up in the hills of California right above Los Angeles and I could see them come and do the spraying because I know where the military base is.
[00:49:12.083 --> 00:49:13.344]  It's off kind of like
[00:49:14.329 --> 00:49:16.231]  I want to see it to the west.
[00:49:30.928 --> 00:49:45.840]  And that, you know, it's a figment of our imagination, is utterly ludicrous and, quite frankly, disgusting that humanity allows it to happen, to have us be ostracized and demonized for pointing out something that is so relatively easy to be seen in the skies as the planes put them up.
[00:49:47.281 --> 00:49:48.102]  Totally crazy.
[00:49:48.302 --> 00:49:49.383]  Like, exactly.
[00:49:49.403 --> 00:49:50.184]  It's so true.
[00:49:50.224 --> 00:49:56.709]  I mean, they... You can't even get information on it, I mean, except for stuff that, um, you know, journalists, you know,
[00:49:57.443 --> 00:50:05.626]  Hardcore journalists like yourself dig out and I mean this sky is like perfectly clear every day and then it's just filled with tic-tacs and you see them.
[00:50:05.646 --> 00:50:08.207]  There's these weird satellites, right?
[00:50:08.267 --> 00:50:10.808]  Satellite dishes right on like the 5 and the 210 highways.
[00:50:12.717 --> 00:50:20.984]  And you'll see clouds in like totally strange geometrical shapes that are just unnatural, like right by where the satellites are.
[00:50:21.064 --> 00:50:22.345]  Well, you gotta wonder what they're doing.
[00:50:22.365 --> 00:50:23.546]  I mean, is that a part of HAARP?
[00:50:23.626 --> 00:50:24.147]  I don't know.
[00:50:24.227 --> 00:50:26.629]  I know they're spraying something in the air and you can see it.
[00:50:27.249 --> 00:50:29.291]  And it's got aluminum oxide and barium in it.
[00:50:29.391 --> 00:50:30.132]  More heavy metals.
[00:50:30.232 --> 00:50:31.793]  What is going on in this country?
[00:50:31.833 --> 00:50:33.214]  What is going on in this world?
[00:50:33.394 --> 00:50:34.615]  We'll be back after this.
[00:50:34.635 --> 00:50:36.357]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:36.397 --> 00:50:38.679]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.

[00:50:51.923 --> 00:50:53.483]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:53.623 --> 00:50:58.244]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:50:58.344 --> 00:51:01.105]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:51:01.305 --> 00:51:04.166]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:04.346 --> 00:51:10.227]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:51:10.427 --> 00:51:13.387]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:13.667 --> 00:51:16.288]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift storable
[00:51:16.548 --> 00:51:17.028]  I think so.
[00:51:46.688 --> 00:51:47.688]  Take action today.
[00:51:47.828 --> 00:51:49.649]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:56.510]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:59.771]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:25.251 --> 00:52:25.991]  All right, folks.
[00:52:26.111 --> 00:52:28.672]  Well, we've been covering this story since it broke.
[00:52:29.812 --> 00:52:36.114]  I had my cop buddy on the line over break and I talked to him and he was confirming four deaths to me.
[00:52:36.754 --> 00:52:39.775]  And now CNN is reporting at least 12 dead.
[00:52:40.535 --> 00:52:42.376]  CVS is saying 13 are dead.
[00:52:43.036 --> 00:52:44.996]  I don't know if the gunman is still at large.
[00:52:46.377 --> 00:52:47.977]  No, the gunman is amongst the dead.
[00:52:48.417 --> 00:52:49.738]  It looks like law enforcement
[00:52:51.101 --> 00:52:56.374]  Law enforcement got to him, but that's 13 confirmed dead right now after this hostage taking.
[00:52:59.141 --> 00:53:02.522]  First of all, it scares me because it is very close to home where I am.
[00:53:02.922 --> 00:53:08.164]  Second of all, it scares me for the implications of this and much more gun restriction.
[00:53:08.204 --> 00:53:12.465]  I mean, it's mainstream news now out of Colorado and elsewhere.
[00:53:12.485 --> 00:53:25.029]  We had a caller calling from Oregon yesterday that ammunition, because people are worried, because people see what's going on with the economic strife, they're not sure if they're going to have a house, if they're going to be dealt with fairly, ammo's gone through the roof.
[00:53:25.669 --> 00:53:27.350]  It's up two to three hundred percent in sales.
[00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:30.591]  We did cover all those stories of all the firearms they sold.
[00:53:30.651 --> 00:53:38.794]  It seems like the only small business owners in this country that are making any scratch at this point are the gun dealers and the ammo dealers.
[00:53:39.855 --> 00:53:52.380]  And I would really hate for more regulations, more restrictions to come on regular American citizens because of what one person did.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:54.121]  I mean, again, we don't have all the facts on this.
[00:53:55.103 --> 00:54:03.169]  I'm sure a lot of this will flesh out over the weekend, and Alex will probably be covering it on the Sunday program.
[00:54:04.429 --> 00:54:06.211]  Alright, let's continue to take your calls.
[00:54:06.231 --> 00:54:08.792]  We are on Paula in Illinois.
[00:54:08.872 --> 00:54:09.713]  Paula, you're on the line.
[00:54:10.854 --> 00:54:11.134]  Hello.
[00:54:11.955 --> 00:54:17.358]  Hey, I listen to Alex just about every day, except for when he gets those right-wing Christians on, I can't handle it.
[00:54:17.819 --> 00:54:21.181]  But I have a little bit different perspective I want to share with you.
[00:54:21.201 --> 00:54:22.021]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:54:22.742 --> 00:54:23.763]  I think that we've had a
[00:54:24.998 --> 00:54:26.299]  Uh, a world order.
[00:54:26.459 --> 00:54:29.821]  Well, we've had a world currency since the end of World War II with Bretton Woods.
[00:54:29.901 --> 00:54:31.222]  It's just that it's been the dollar.
[00:54:31.602 --> 00:54:41.248]  A gold standard in 1972, they immediately aligned with Saudi Arabia to have oil back the dollar.
[00:54:41.288 --> 00:54:45.530]  So the dollar has been the de facto world currency since 1945.
[00:54:46.351 --> 00:54:49.473]  What I think we're seeing now is the other countries rebelling.
[00:54:49.933 --> 00:54:51.174]  And the same with, um,
[00:54:51.653 --> 00:54:54.775]  The same with the corporations ruling the world.
[00:54:54.815 --> 00:54:55.896]  That's not new.
[00:54:56.016 --> 00:55:08.406]  That's happened since 1945, with IMF and the World Bank coming in and ruling the third world countries for the benefit of US capital and also international capital.
[00:55:09.126 --> 00:55:19.314]  And what the New World Order that Bush was talking about was when the Soviet Union was no longer around, that the United States would then control the entire world, both militarily, economically,
[00:55:20.639 --> 00:55:23.262]  I think the New World Order has been around for a long time, is what I'm saying.
[00:55:23.282 --> 00:55:23.522]  No, I agree.
[00:55:23.542 --> 00:55:25.044]  It's not that they're trying to put it in.
[00:55:25.905 --> 00:55:26.585]  We've had it.
[00:55:26.705 --> 00:55:27.206]  We've had it.
[00:55:27.226 --> 00:55:30.369]  It's just that as Americans, we haven't really... They're announcing it more.
[00:55:30.489 --> 00:55:31.831]  You know what I mean?
[00:55:32.512 --> 00:55:34.994]  Obviously, it's been in the works for over a hundred years.
[00:55:35.235 --> 00:55:37.277]  We highlighted Hitler's book, H.G.
[00:55:37.317 --> 00:55:39.960]  Wells' book, all these institutions that you just talked about.
[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:41.661]  You didn't talk about some of the other ones.
[00:55:42.142 --> 00:55:42.823]  I don't see it that way.
[00:55:42.843 --> 00:55:44.204]  I see it as a staged mechanism like Sarkozy saying
[00:55:59.722 --> 00:56:01.543]  Oh, we're not going to get anything done.
[00:56:02.083 --> 00:56:03.924]  I'm going to leave this conference right now.
[00:56:04.185 --> 00:56:05.325]  And then he's smiling at the end.
[00:56:05.365 --> 00:56:12.249]  No, this is definitely, though, to shift gears away from the United States as being the dominant country.
[00:56:12.669 --> 00:56:14.230]  It's about globalism in that respect.
[00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:15.551]  I don't think it's anybody rebelling.
[00:56:15.891 --> 00:56:22.695]  I think it's the fact that the United States' time has come, and now we have to amalgamate it into the North American Union to further
[00:56:23.175 --> 00:56:24.616]  This globalization process.
[00:56:24.656 --> 00:56:26.338]  I think the New World Order is an idea.
[00:56:26.658 --> 00:56:27.659]  I think it's a process.
[00:56:27.999 --> 00:56:35.645]  I think that when you have world leaders like Gordon Brown at the G20 Summit actually announcing it, however, it's becoming more in the public eye.
[00:56:35.945 --> 00:56:41.110]  And you may see it as an actual institution or government organization in the near future.
[00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:42.231]  But have we been living under it?
[00:56:42.271 --> 00:56:45.153]  You're damn right we've been living under it for quite some time now.
[00:56:45.433 --> 00:56:46.614]  Paula, I thank you for the call.
[00:56:46.854 --> 00:56:51.938]  We're going to go to Veronica, John, Adam and others on the other side after we play a little Max Keiser.
[00:56:52.739 --> 00:56:55.741]  It's the Alex Jones Show, PrisonPlan.TV, InfoWars.com.
[00:57:02.204 --> 00:57:03.464]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:57:03.504 --> 00:57:08.847]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:57:09.087 --> 00:57:13.729]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:19.132]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:57:19.679 --> 00:57:24.381]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:57:24.901 --> 00:57:26.841]  They call it the Survival Seed Bank.
[00:57:27.222 --> 00:57:31.823]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:57:32.023 --> 00:57:32.923]  And here's the best part.
[00:57:33.144 --> 00:57:35.904]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:57:36.205 --> 00:57:39.506]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:57:39.826 --> 00:57:42.667]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:57:43.007 --> 00:57:44.908]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:57:45.228 --> 00:57:46.148]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:57:49.807 --> 00:57:51.588]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:58.553]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:57:58.874 --> 00:58:01.315]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:58:02.496 --> 00:58:07.820]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:08.321 --> 00:58:15.326]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:58:15.882 --> 00:58:22.084]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:22.464 --> 00:58:24.304]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:24.444 --> 00:58:26.865]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:26.945 --> 00:58:37.888]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:58:38.513 --> 00:58:39.814]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:40.194 --> 00:58:41.574]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:58:42.035 --> 00:58:48.377]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:58:48.957 --> 00:58:56.741]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:57.221 --> 00:58:58.361]  The Obama Deception.
[00:58:58.781 --> 00:58:59.982]  The people strike back.
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:04.941]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:59:05.102 --> 00:59:10.364]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:59:10.624 --> 00:59:15.967]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:59:16.347 --> 00:59:17.467]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.828 --> 00:59:26.732]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:59:27.132 --> 00:59:28.774]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:59:28.974 --> 00:59:33.139]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[00:59:33.179 --> 00:59:37.824]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[00:59:38.205 --> 00:59:39.887]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[00:59:42.049 --> 00:59:42.810]  Keep it natural.
[00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:51.295]  Call Calbin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[00:59:51.515 --> 00:59:57.018]  Try Calbin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[00:59:57.578 --> 01:00:00.680]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:00:03.082 --> 01:00:05.243]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:00:05.843 --> 01:00:08.705]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:13.637 --> 01:00:16.570]  Yeah.
[01:00:18.175 --> 01:00:20.316]  Alright folks, we are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:20.376 --> 01:00:21.616]  I'm Jason Burmas sitting in.
[01:00:22.136 --> 01:00:24.417]  We're live at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:00:24.437 --> 01:00:28.298]  We're going to continue to go to your calls, Veronica, John, Adam, and Mark.
[01:00:28.318 --> 01:00:31.600]  But first, I want to play this Max Keiser on Paris TV clip.
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:33.360]  Folks, he sets it all here.
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:43.804]  He names the criminals, who they are, what should be done to them, and how they are controlling this implosion of the economy like a controlled demolition coup d'etat.
[01:00:43.884 --> 01:00:44.484]  Hit it, Jaren.
[01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:51.019]  Well, joining me now on the phone is Max Keiser, the journalist and broadcaster, live from Paris in France.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.286]  Max, Goldman and Morgan now subject to regulation.
[01:00:54.446 --> 01:00:58.533]  Isn't this what critics of their highly geared dealing have been demanding for years?
[01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:02.311]  I'm not so sure, Ashton.
[01:01:02.331 --> 01:01:07.336]  I think this is a great way for them now to hide any close examination of their books.
[01:01:07.456 --> 01:01:09.938]  I think this is actually in the cards from the beginning.
[01:01:10.219 --> 01:01:13.081]  Because, as you know, Morgan and... J.P.
[01:01:13.121 --> 01:01:17.926]  Morgan and Goldman Sachs have been involved in a tremendous amount of...
[01:01:18.606 --> 01:01:21.147]  Let's call it euphemistically money laundering over the years.
[01:01:21.647 --> 01:01:32.050]  And now by becoming a commercial bank, I believe that this is going to insulate themselves from any real close examination because they're going to be behind the firewall, behind Hank Paulson's firewall.
[01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:34.971]  You know, Hank Paulson has effectively hijacked the U.S.
[01:01:35.011 --> 01:01:35.691]  financial system.
[01:01:35.711 --> 01:01:38.492]  He's no different than the 9-11 hijackers as far as I'm concerned.
[01:01:38.872 --> 01:01:41.313]  He's a financial terrorist and he's taken the U.S.
[01:01:41.353 --> 01:01:46.955]  banking system to the edge of the abyss, all for the benefit of the shareholders and his cronies.
[01:01:47.936 --> 01:02:06.134]  But doesn't the new regulatory provision, because they will now be holding companies, mean that we can expect loads of SEC, US Treasury officials all flying around the world to Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs' offices, checking all the records, interviewing the staff, checking on probity?
[01:02:08.325 --> 01:02:26.973]  Yes, but at the same time, as this coup d'etat has taken place and given Hank Paul some dictatorial powers to determine what is fact, the information that should be disclosed or not disclosed, combine that with Bush's dictatorial powers to declare a state of emergency at the drop of a hat, I don't think any of this information is going to see the light of day.
[01:02:27.233 --> 01:02:31.234]  It's just like, you remember Building 7 on 9-11 is where they had all those Enron records?
[01:02:33.355 --> 01:02:38.357]  Those twin towers collapsing was kind of a cover to keep those records from being examined.
[01:02:38.917 --> 01:02:42.258]  These guys will stop at nothing to keep their dirty laundry a secret.
[01:02:43.859 --> 01:02:52.422]  Even all the auditing companies, all the auditing companies that now these banks will have to be scrutinized by under federal law?
[01:02:53.991 --> 01:02:55.272]  To what auditing companies?
[01:02:55.432 --> 01:03:02.594]  The ones that have been discredited for the last ten years and gone out of business, like Arthur Anderson, who's auditing Enron, for example?
[01:03:02.835 --> 01:03:07.336]  The auditing companies, the rating agencies, the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve Bank, this is a criminal syndicate.
[01:03:07.376 --> 01:03:08.877]  This should be investigated under RICO.
[01:03:09.197 --> 01:03:12.098]  These guys are wholesale thieving of trillions of dollars.
[01:03:12.738 --> 01:03:18.701]  The rest of the world, unfortunately, or fortunately, will wake up to the fact that they should probably get out.
[01:03:19.241 --> 01:03:19.701]  Of the U.S.
[01:03:19.741 --> 01:03:25.544]  dollar, because that's the only tether between the rest of the world and this criminal syndicate on Wall Street headed up by Hank Paulson.
[01:03:25.824 --> 01:03:32.667]  So once they figure that out, the dollar goes into permanent decline, and the rest of the world will escape this nightmare of U.S.
[01:03:32.847 --> 01:03:33.407]  banking.
[01:03:34.168 --> 01:03:37.289]  You know, Hank Paulson has become kind of like a Colonel Kirk's character.
[01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:38.230]  He's gone insane.
[01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:39.570]  Nobody can stop him.
[01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:46.073]  They need to send like a Martin Sheen guy up the river to find him and take him out, because he's taking the entire U.S.
[01:03:46.113 --> 01:03:47.894]  economy into oblivion.
[01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:51.947]  At the very least, will they at least have to pay more tax?
[01:03:52.067 --> 01:03:58.029]  Because after so many years, people have been saying the Goldman Partners, when it was a partnership, they paid very little tax.
[01:04:01.791 --> 01:04:07.894]  Are they going to be extradited from some low-tax country with a non-extradition agreement?
[01:04:07.914 --> 01:04:09.715]  They're not going to stick around in the U.S.
[01:04:09.735 --> 01:04:14.097]  when the Americans are going to have their pitchforks ready to go in and take back their country.
[01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:15.377]  They're not going to stick around for that.
[01:04:15.457 --> 01:04:16.978]  That's for somebody else to do.
[01:04:17.779 --> 01:04:21.000]  Will the poor of America now be able to open current accounts?
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:24.862]  Grandmothers with, you know, $10 to spare at Goldman Sachs brunch.
[01:04:29.084 --> 01:04:32.926]  Ashton, I don't think you're getting the full picture here.
[01:04:33.526 --> 01:04:44.911]  In order to bail out these crooks, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve will flood the economy with trillions of dollars, which will take the value of the dollar down to zero.
[01:04:45.311 --> 01:04:48.912]  Sure, you can open an account at Goldman Sachs with your $100 retirement fund.
[01:04:48.952 --> 01:04:52.893]  Unfortunately, that $100 won't buy you toilet paper.
[01:04:53.253 --> 01:04:57.114]  Toilet paper is going to be, you know, this is more valuable than the U.S.
[01:04:57.134 --> 01:04:58.935]  dollar in a few weeks' time.
[01:04:59.515 --> 01:05:00.235]  $100 a sheet.
[01:05:00.295 --> 01:05:00.555]  This is $100.
[01:05:00.595 --> 01:05:03.096]  I can make dollars right here all I want.
[01:05:03.116 --> 01:05:03.296]  Here's $1,000.
[01:05:03.436 --> 01:05:04.936]  Here's $5,000.
[01:05:05.236 --> 01:05:05.376]  Here's $1,000,000.
[01:05:05.517 --> 01:05:08.177]  It's all going to complete zero.
[01:05:08.217 --> 01:05:09.438]  It's like the Weimar Republic.
[01:05:09.678 --> 01:05:10.998]  They'll say, have all the money you want.
[01:05:11.058 --> 01:05:11.678]  How did they do that?
[01:05:11.698 --> 01:05:12.979]  $500 billion doesn't make any difference.
[01:05:14.599 --> 01:05:15.521]  We're just all worthless!
[01:05:15.741 --> 01:05:18.186]  How did they pick this $700 billion figure anyway?
[01:05:18.226 --> 01:05:23.977]  Because there were some estimates of $1.3 trillion, then there was a $500... Where were they getting these numbers from?
[01:05:26.391 --> 01:05:32.155]  The $700 billion is an arbitrary sum, and it's not the extent to which they can launder this money.
[01:05:32.195 --> 01:05:36.198]  It just means that they can't go exceed that level at any given moment of the laundering scheme.
[01:05:36.419 --> 01:05:37.379]  Let me tell you how it works.
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:48.448]  In other words, they got the $700 billion slush fund, they can buy a mortgage for 50 cents on the dollar to help out their banking buddies, and then they can resell it for some other chump for 20 cents on the dollar, book a loss.
[01:05:48.968 --> 01:05:56.152]  For the American public, take it off the $700 billion, excuse me, $700 billion slush fund, and then repeat the process over and over again.
[01:05:56.232 --> 01:06:04.217]  And they can keep the circular motion of this money laundering scheme, multi-national Ponzi scheme going, but now it's like, it's a controlled demolition.
[01:06:04.257 --> 01:06:06.739]  It's not unlike 9-11, which was a controlled demolition.
[01:06:07.099 --> 01:06:08.820]  This is a controlled demolition of the U.S.
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:09.480]  banking system.
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:13.803]  Hank Paulson has become the arsonist and pyromaniac in chief.
[01:06:14.203 --> 01:06:15.043]  His job is to
[01:06:16.604 --> 01:06:17.924]  Floor by floor, take the U.S.
[01:06:17.964 --> 01:06:19.365]  banking system down, take the U.S.
[01:06:19.405 --> 01:06:26.147]  dollar down to its absolute zero, and do so without upsetting his Chinese masters, his Middle Eastern masters.
[01:06:26.587 --> 01:06:27.527]  And he's a tyrant!
[01:06:27.607 --> 01:06:31.849]  Under the Constitution, Hank Paulson qualifies as a tyrant and should be taken up on charges.
[01:06:31.909 --> 01:06:39.731]  Under the Constitution, it's a constitutional obligation of every American to get Hank Paulson into a court of law as a tyrant!
[01:06:40.185 --> 01:06:42.327]  Well, you were talking about a question of timing.
[01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:45.329]  By the way, Building 7 is a bit more controversial.
[01:06:45.830 --> 01:06:47.631]  We'll have to save that for another time.
[01:06:48.132 --> 01:06:59.461]  But as to the timing, as long as the Chinese don't withdraw their dollars, does that mean that they could just stave off a real systemic economic collapse in the United States till after the election?
[01:07:02.515 --> 01:07:07.779]  I think that the word from China was that they were going to start dumping U.S.
[01:07:07.819 --> 01:07:08.219]  dollars.
[01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:33.856]  Let's continue to go to your calls.
[01:07:33.896 --> 01:07:35.858]  I believe we are on Veronica in Canada.
[01:07:35.898 --> 01:07:36.918]  Veronica, you're on the line.
[01:07:37.479 --> 01:07:37.999]  Hi, Jason.
[01:07:38.019 --> 01:07:38.339]  How are you?
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:38.960]  Good.
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:39.881]  That's good.
[01:07:40.281 --> 01:07:45.284]  I work at a health food store, and I'm always trying to inform everybody about silver.
[01:07:45.305 --> 01:07:48.127]  Because silver, that can kill a lot of things.
[01:07:48.227 --> 01:07:49.307]  It can kill the aging flu.
[01:07:50.809 --> 01:07:52.650]  The colloidal silver is what you're talking about, right?
[01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:53.591]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:07:54.591 --> 01:07:55.532]  And ionic as well.
[01:07:57.053 --> 01:07:59.895]  And we got this letter at the store last night.
[01:08:00.035 --> 01:08:00.696]  It's a short letter.
[01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:02.460]  Please be informed.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:10.442]  Now, I don't know if it's just from the supplier or not, but this is from our supplier, but I don't know if they're the only supplier that got this letter or not.
[01:08:10.962 --> 01:08:15.083]  Please be informed that effective immediately... Excuse me.
[01:08:15.523 --> 01:08:21.845]  You are to withhold your entire inventory of Silver Solution products from Mission Falls Ionic Silver Solution from retail sale.
[01:08:22.425 --> 01:08:25.405]  This is a directive that has been issued to us straight from Health Canada.
[01:08:25.966 --> 01:08:27.886]  I'm sorry, my voice went all of a sudden.
[01:08:28.564 --> 01:08:29.625]  You know, I've been hearing this.
[01:08:29.665 --> 01:08:36.650]  I actually got a couple of calls before you on my other show, and I thank you for the call, Veronica, that they seem to be regulating colloidal silver.
[01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:43.195]  And a lot of people have said, you know, this kills a lot of things like bird flu, Morgellons, and other types of diseases.
[01:08:43.215 --> 01:08:47.057]  So is this them trying to restrict our access to something that will keep us healthy?
[01:08:47.518 --> 01:08:48.298]  More than likely.
[01:08:48.639 --> 01:08:50.320]  If you have anything more, if you know that this is
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:51.460]  Let's jump to our next caller.
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:53.441]  Let's go to John in California.
[01:08:53.461 --> 01:08:54.361]  John, you're on the air.
[01:08:54.561 --> 01:08:55.701]  Hey, it's all Burmese all the time, man.
[01:08:55.721 --> 01:08:56.461]  This is great.
[01:08:56.481 --> 01:08:56.941]  How you doing?
[01:09:20.755 --> 01:09:23.216]  Um, so I wanted to say thanks for everything.
[01:09:23.336 --> 01:09:26.456]  I've been pretty much using all your resources, all the Prison Planet TV stuff.
[01:09:26.516 --> 01:09:29.617]  I've been going through Tarpley's books, now I'm reading Russ Baker's Bush book.
[01:09:30.577 --> 01:09:34.338]  Man, what an amazing, amazing, amazing compilation that is.
[01:09:34.378 --> 01:09:42.740]  But I wanted to call and talk to you about, um, about the occult, you know, because I heard somebody call the other day and you were like, it's like white magic, black magic, this and that.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.341]  And you know, I mean, a lot of people that do use magical type practices are
[01:09:49.434 --> 01:10:04.558]  Funnily enough, being validated by quantum science, because the behavioral type stuff that happens in say, like a magic spell or a meditation or whatever you want to call it, actually happens on the atomic level, and they're finding these things like these non-local principles,
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:06.301]  Um, in quantum physics, you know?
[01:10:06.321 --> 01:10:09.844]  So it's interesting, though, like, these mystery religions are being sort of validated.
[01:10:09.924 --> 01:10:10.745]  Well, let's just say this.
[01:10:10.885 --> 01:10:12.887]  I mean, let's put it in this perspective.
[01:10:13.067 --> 01:10:17.911]  Alchemy used to be, you know, not only, you know, this occult ritual type stuff, but it was science.
[01:10:18.212 --> 01:10:18.652]  You know what I mean?
[01:10:18.692 --> 01:10:19.773]  These things were intertwined back in the day.
[01:10:19.793 --> 01:10:21.595]  No doubt, no doubt, but it was meta-science, you know?
[01:10:21.675 --> 01:10:31.103]  And they would even say, like, there was people that thought that it was a code, you know, that alchemy, the search for the Rose Cross, for instance, was a code for a man having sex with a woman, becoming God, creating life.
[01:10:32.939 --> 01:10:37.544]  Also, I'm not giving validity or not, I'm just saying we do have freedom of religion under the Constitution.
[01:10:37.584 --> 01:10:54.560]  Oh yeah, and I'm not trying to control anyone's religious beliefs, I just put it out there that look, I'm not pro-occult either side, and I think a lot of people that do these white magic practices are kind of fooling themselves into believing they're part of a different spectrum of the people that do the black magic stuff.
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.281]  You know what I mean?
[01:10:55.481 --> 01:11:11.331]  Yeah, it's possible, but I mean, I was raised Catholic, like Roman Catholic, and I didn't dig on it at all, so... And then I started to do some of this, like, ritual magic type stuff, and I'm not super into it, but I've gone to some different masses and met a bunch of cool people, and I've really had some spiritual experiences that have, like, brought me cool things.
[01:11:11.771 --> 01:11:24.620]  So, what I'm saying is, like, you know, the word occult itself is kind of like, you know, there's no value judgment to have on it, just like globalism, you know, because I think that globalism, and I, not like the zeitgeist thing, or certainly not killing 90% of us,
[01:11:27.102 --> 01:11:28.486]  Have you ever read Buckminster Fuller?
[01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:30.790]  No, I haven't.
[01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:33.371]  Man, this guy's book's called Synergetics and Synergetics 2.
[01:11:33.431 --> 01:11:41.513]  He basically, I mean, he invented the geodesic dome and all these different metals that are banned for use because they would be too strong, you know?
[01:11:42.173 --> 01:11:42.613]  Interesting.
[01:11:43.234 --> 01:11:44.434]  John, I thank you for the call.
[01:11:44.534 --> 01:11:45.774]  I'll definitely check it out.
[01:11:45.794 --> 01:11:49.795]  You know, I'm not necessarily against anybody because of their religious beliefs.
[01:11:49.855 --> 01:11:52.716]  I just feel like you look at the guys at the top, they're into the occult.
[01:11:52.756 --> 01:11:53.536]  Why is that?
[01:11:53.556 --> 01:11:54.937]  Maybe there is something to it, folks.
[01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:55.337]  Who knows?
[01:11:55.397 --> 01:11:56.557]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:11:56.957 --> 01:11:58.458]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:02.754 --> 01:12:05.136]  This year millions of people will lose electricity.
[01:12:05.496 --> 01:12:09.520]  Ice storms, earthquakes, flooding or hurricanes could leave you without power for days.
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:13.863]  Anyone that's ever been in a blackout knows that the first thing you need is a flashlight.
[01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:16.165]  That's why you need the Paclite.
[01:12:16.445 --> 01:12:20.909]  The Paclite is powered by a 9-volt battery and lasts up to 1,200 hours.
[01:12:21.249 --> 01:12:27.534]  It's so small it fits right in your pocket and glows in the dark, making it easy to find when you need it most.
[01:12:28.155 --> 01:12:29.356]  One Florida customer says,
[01:12:29.816 --> 01:12:37.858]  My Paclite has lasted through 4 hurricanes in 2 years, over 30 days without electricity, and I'm still using the same battery.
[01:12:38.398 --> 01:12:42.539]  The Paclite comes with a 25 year warranty and prices start at just $12.99.
[01:12:43.059 --> 01:12:45.939]  It's time for you to be prepared with a Paclite.

[01:13:23.223 --> 01:13:27.967]  In fact, if you call and order their free MIDAS report, MIDAS Resources will pay you!
[01:13:28.067 --> 01:13:33.552]  This detailed report will provide you with financial history on the safest and most profitable areas to invest in.

[01:13:49.685 --> 01:14:01.350]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[01:14:02.811 --> 01:14:08.033]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:14:08.841 --> 01:14:14.203]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:14:14.703 --> 01:14:20.905]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:14:21.205 --> 01:14:23.026]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:14:23.186 --> 01:14:25.566]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:14:25.646 --> 01:14:36.370]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:14:38.832 --> 01:14:40.073]  It's not about left or right.
[01:14:40.493 --> 01:14:41.894]  It's about a one world government.
[01:14:42.354 --> 01:14:48.698]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:14:49.259 --> 01:14:57.064]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:14:57.524 --> 01:14:58.685]  The Obama Deception.
[01:14:59.105 --> 01:15:00.286]  The people strike back.
[01:15:02.094 --> 01:15:05.357]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:15:05.538 --> 01:15:09.602]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:15:09.782 --> 01:15:17.750]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water,
[01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:21.211]  Without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:15:21.431 --> 01:15:27.312]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:15:27.572 --> 01:15:31.933]  And germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[01:15:32.233 --> 01:15:37.074]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper.
[01:15:37.174 --> 01:15:40.235]  With a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[01:15:40.435 --> 01:15:47.056]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of healthcare.
[01:15:51.303 --> 01:15:54.004]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A Silver dot com.
[01:15:54.184 --> 01:15:54.784]  Or call 888-213-4338.
[01:15:54.804 --> 01:15:54.844]  888-213-4338.
[01:15:54.864 --> 01:15:55.984]  And help us win this battle.
[01:15:56.044 --> 01:15:56.845]  Come you masters of war.
[01:15:56.865 --> 01:15:57.925]  Here to build the big guns.
[01:15:57.945 --> 01:15:59.385]  Here to build the death planes.
[01:15:59.425 --> 01:16:00.466]  Here to build all the bombs.
[01:16:22.293 --> 01:16:34.922]  I can see through your mask.
[01:16:36.283 --> 01:16:38.104]  Alright folks, we're back at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:38.124 --> 01:16:39.986]  We're going to continue to take your calls.
[01:16:40.026 --> 01:16:41.587]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in for Alex.
[01:16:42.167 --> 01:16:46.170]  I'll be doing my own little live show tonight, taking your calls from 9 to midnight.
[01:16:49.727 --> 01:16:52.169]  Let's go to Adam in Canada.
[01:16:52.469 --> 01:16:53.030]  Adam, you're up.
[01:16:54.471 --> 01:16:56.493]  Are we on, Adam?
[01:16:56.673 --> 01:16:57.334]  We're on, Adam, right?
[01:16:57.774 --> 01:16:58.114]  Yes, sir.
[01:16:58.174 --> 01:16:59.776]  Hello?
[01:16:59.796 --> 01:17:00.196]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:17:00.857 --> 01:17:01.137]  Oh, hi.
[01:17:01.217 --> 01:17:01.937]  How are you today, Jason?
[01:17:02.258 --> 01:17:02.418]  Good.
[01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:04.319]  That's good to hear.
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:08.683]  The theme of today, or some of it I've noticed from the callers, is on how to wake people up.
[01:17:09.904 --> 01:17:11.426]  And I've been finding a lot of trouble myself.
[01:17:11.966 --> 01:17:15.269]  I've only been awake six months, about a year.
[01:17:15.939 --> 01:17:24.104]  And I find it really difficult to convince people of what's going on, mostly because whenever you say anything, you look like you're crazy.
[01:17:24.124 --> 01:17:26.005]  You know what I mean?
[01:17:26.145 --> 01:17:32.288]  We've all been programmed to think that conspiracy theorists are nuts and they believe in aliens and all that kind of stuff and draw those kind of connections.
[01:17:32.869 --> 01:17:38.432]  And I just, I wanted to talk about ways to wake up people that are close to you or people that you know, slowly.
[01:17:38.452 --> 01:17:39.092]  Sure, sure.
[01:17:39.753 --> 01:17:40.393]  How do I do it?
[01:17:41.114 --> 01:17:41.774]  Yeah, how do you do it?
[01:17:42.236 --> 01:17:48.441]  All right, well, I mean, first of all, technology is a double-edged sword just like anything, just like the guy called in the occult, I guess.
[01:17:48.481 --> 01:17:50.683]  You know, it can be used to do good or harm.
[01:17:51.084 --> 01:17:52.385]  So I use it to do good.
[01:17:52.425 --> 01:17:58.810]  In other words, you know, I have stuff on my phone that I can break out in a moment's notice if I get into a conversation with somebody about something.
[01:17:59.050 --> 01:18:07.357]  I usually also feel someone out, see where their perspective is and where they're coming from, you know, get their opinion first, and then try to find a common viewpoint to
[01:18:08.198 --> 01:18:08.458]  I think?
[01:18:31.929 --> 01:18:38.291]  I would also, you know, definitely try to show that this supersedes left and right and show some of the scarier stuff.
[01:18:38.351 --> 01:18:48.055]  I think that the implantable microchip is, you know, the Verichip and, you know, the RealID Act, RFIDs are one of the scariest things out there and they're very, very easy to prove to people.
[01:18:48.155 --> 01:18:55.158]  I mean, I can pull up a chip for sale right now on eBay that I can order, have within a week, and if I want, inject myself with.
[01:18:55.238 --> 01:18:56.398]  I mean, that's a privatized one.
[01:18:56.418 --> 01:18:59.859]  But then, there are these other programs, you know, I like to pull up the clip from 2004
[01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:13.823]  When Peter Jennings is admitting that 144 Mexican workers in the National Security Agency over there took chips for secure places at the workforce, you know, to gain access.
[01:19:14.123 --> 01:19:20.025]  So I try to find common points that are going to scare everybody or get everybody to at least take a look at that information.
[01:19:20.365 --> 01:19:25.306]  And another thing that I often tell people, friends and family, you know, have the card game at your house.
[01:19:25.706 --> 01:19:25.906]  We're good.
[01:19:40.971 --> 01:19:42.432]  I'd always been into hip-hop.
[01:19:42.452 --> 01:19:46.473]  Something prevalent throughout hip-hop culture was the idea that drugs were brought in by the government.
[01:20:07.833 --> 01:20:09.194]  And I always thought it was nonsense.
[01:20:09.354 --> 01:20:15.658]  I even heard of Alex Jones like 10 years ago at a girlfriend's father who was a crazy guy.
[01:20:15.678 --> 01:20:16.799]  I thought he was crazy.
[01:20:17.219 --> 01:20:19.521]  He showed me a radio program by him and stuff like that.
[01:20:19.541 --> 01:20:20.321]  I always thought he was nuts.
[01:20:20.701 --> 01:20:24.424]  First time I ever heard the loose change, I thought you were crazy.
[01:20:25.004 --> 01:20:36.932]  And then what really changed was I was just scanning through some news documents and it was something about absolutely proven that in the 1980s the CIA flew cocaine into LA.
[01:20:37.535 --> 01:20:38.316]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:20:38.376 --> 01:20:47.362]  Well, what they were doing is they were taking cocaine and marijuana from South America and then they were trading arms, but they weren't even... See, they would use plausible deniability and proxy nations.
[01:20:47.702 --> 01:21:02.353]  In other words, they would have Israel round up all the weapons from the Czech Republic and other parts of, you know, Romania, all these places in Europe, and then they would take the weapons and they would give them to the Contras, again giving us plausible deniability, but it was all run by our intelligence organizations.
[01:21:02.373 --> 01:21:03.694]  This came out in hearings.
[01:21:03.754 --> 01:21:05.175]  People got convicted of it.
[01:21:05.535 --> 01:21:08.857]  To say that it's a conspiracy theory is absolutely ludicrous.
[01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:15.159]  We had multiple pilots go public and say that they not only flew them into the United States, but they flew the drugs into U.S.
[01:21:15.319 --> 01:21:17.280]  airbases where they were protected and paid.
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:17.861]  Go ahead.
[01:21:18.441 --> 01:21:20.482]  And that's exactly what woke me up with.
[01:21:20.502 --> 01:21:26.705]  I sat there and I went, well, there was this something that I didn't believe in for so long that I thought was just silly, you know, mumbo-jumbo.
[01:21:27.025 --> 01:21:29.226]  And then you find out that it's absolutely true, 100% illegal.
[01:21:30.327 --> 01:21:35.429]  What other crazy things have I heard about or nonsensical things that I've passed off as?
[01:21:35.489 --> 01:21:40.991]  Well, it shows you that all this information is important and that we can't drop these types of issues because they use them again and again.
[01:21:41.031 --> 01:21:46.054]  If it's the drug war that woke you up and brought you into all this, try to find something like that for other people.
[01:21:46.094 --> 01:21:50.035]  Remember, play on their beliefs at first and then bring them across.
[01:21:50.055 --> 01:21:50.996]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:21:52.096 --> 01:21:52.996]  We're on the march.
[01:21:53.477 --> 01:21:55.077]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:55.097 --> 01:21:58.699]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:02.253 --> 01:22:03.434]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:22:03.614 --> 01:22:05.876]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[01:22:06.016 --> 01:22:10.019]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[01:22:10.179 --> 01:22:13.862]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:22:13.942 --> 01:22:22.409]  If you agree with one guy screaming about global warming instead of 650 climatologists who know the Earth is cooling, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:22:22.509 --> 01:22:26.132]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[01:22:26.352 --> 01:22:30.776]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime,
[01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:39.331]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:23:05.712 --> 01:23:07.833]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:23:08.333 --> 01:23:15.377]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:23:15.919 --> 01:23:22.082]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:23:22.483 --> 01:23:24.324]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:23:24.464 --> 01:23:26.885]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:23:26.965 --> 01:23:37.931]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:23:38.547 --> 01:23:39.827]  It's not about left or right.
[01:23:40.207 --> 01:23:41.628]  It's about a one world government.
[01:23:42.068 --> 01:23:48.410]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:56.772]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:57.232 --> 01:23:58.392]  The Obama Deception.
[01:23:58.813 --> 01:24:00.013]  The people strike back.
[01:24:01.798 --> 01:24:06.640]  The new multipolar inline and portable water system new from HempUSA.org.
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:15.244]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source rendering chemicals harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[01:24:15.464 --> 01:24:20.166]  Imagine a softer smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system and brain.
[01:24:20.387 --> 01:24:27.270]  There are no filters to buy and it can be taken anywhere making it our number one new product from HempUSA.org.
[01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:30.011]  This water system will descale all piping, hot
[01:24:30.291 --> 01:24:30.732]  We're good.
[01:24:44.124 --> 01:24:44.444]  I think so.
[01:25:15.051 --> 01:25:16.152]  All right, folks, we are back.
[01:25:16.212 --> 01:25:17.292]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:22.315]  We're going to continue to take your calls in a moment, but I just want to thank one final sponsor today.
[01:25:22.895 --> 01:25:24.456]  Survivalistseeds.com.
[01:25:24.556 --> 01:25:25.736]  Survivalistseeds.com.
[01:25:25.976 --> 01:25:30.078]  Now you can grow your own healthy food for just four pennies a pound and break free of the NWO.
[01:25:30.479 --> 01:25:37.302]  Our sponsor, Survivalist Seeds, has now drastically reduced their prices for heirloom seeds at www.survivalistseeds.com.
[01:25:37.722 --> 01:25:37.962]  Hey, bro!
[01:25:38.002 --> 01:25:38.582]  How you doing?
[01:26:04.611 --> 01:26:08.053]  My impression is that, I call it the reign of the beast.
[01:26:08.834 --> 01:26:14.757]  And my gut impression is, I'm not even remotely worried about people like you.
[01:26:15.397 --> 01:26:23.162]  I'm concerned about the people who think themselves Christian, because they fall lockstep with everything they've been programmed into.
[01:26:23.182 --> 01:26:24.423]  You're a Berean.
[01:26:25.063 --> 01:26:33.688]  You trust what you can verify and substantiate, and when somebody questions your questioning, you go, why is it you have a problem with me asking a question
[01:26:34.292 --> 01:26:36.473]  About this thing that you maintain is so important.
[01:26:36.513 --> 01:26:39.474]  Why is it that you insist that I take what you have to say at face value?
[01:26:40.614 --> 01:26:50.737]  And, um, that's the thing I want to clarify, is that from my point of view, and of course people are free to disagree, is that we're looking at the reign of the beast.
[01:26:51.077 --> 01:26:56.279]  And the beast is not going to come to power because he's so open and honest about what he's really about.
[01:26:57.019 --> 01:27:04.041]  He's going to come to power because he's slick and smooth and charming, and like I tried to explain to my dear, demented parent,
[01:27:04.915 --> 01:27:12.617]  The more smooth and eloquent a politician's rhetoric is, that means you have to crank up the gain on the bull spit detector.
[01:27:13.257 --> 01:27:23.199]  It means you have to be all the more careful about what are they saying, because politicians are relying on us taking their stated goals at face value.
[01:27:23.319 --> 01:27:31.260]  Oh, by the way, my site is doyoulovejesus.org, and I'll be the first to admit I'm trying to get it rebuilt, because it's a mess right now.
[01:27:34.861 --> 01:27:39.569]  You understand that the word agnostic and the word ignorant are of the same root?
[01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:45.017]  That you're not just concerned about... You want to be able to test things and verify things.
[01:27:45.198 --> 01:27:47.562]  It's not that you have a problem with the Christian religion.
[01:27:47.582 --> 01:27:49.024]  You have a problem with the apostate.
[01:27:50.669 --> 01:27:51.810]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:27:52.110 --> 01:28:05.422]  I have a problem with people telling me I'm less of a human being if I believe this or I believe one way, and I just feel like we're never going to be able to defeat these guys and try to bring back the Constitution and Bill of Rights if we're bickering over things as petty as religion or race
[01:28:05.942 --> 01:28:06.042]  Amen.
[01:28:06.062 --> 01:28:06.943]  So, you're going to be on tonight?
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:29.981]  I am going to be on tonight, my man.
[01:28:30.121 --> 01:28:33.683]  I'll tell you what, I imagine you probably have other callers.
[01:28:33.743 --> 01:28:51.594]  Again, doyoulovejesus.org, that's the letter U, and I'm trying to get it to where it's not the embarrassment that it is now, and I gather we can continue this discussion later, because I believe the Apostle Paul, name sound familiar, had warm memories of the Bereans when he wrote, test everything.
[01:28:52.295 --> 01:28:57.238]  Including, you know, because the thing is, I look at how people have accepted things at face value,
[01:28:58.064 --> 01:29:02.006]  As though truth were a democracy, and I'm like, no it's not!
[01:29:02.826 --> 01:29:09.909]  And God's not going to ask my advice on Judgment Day about your soul any more than He's going to ask your advice about mine.
[01:29:10.089 --> 01:29:17.533]  So why are we hung up about my opinion as to where any particular person or set of persons is going?
[01:29:18.013 --> 01:29:20.294]  Why don't we just try to live out a genuine message?
[01:29:20.934 --> 01:29:25.156]  You see, the thing is, tough love is essentially we must be accountable to each other.
[01:29:25.872 --> 01:29:28.175]  I just wonder why we seem to be so powerless as a society.
[01:29:49.776 --> 01:29:55.501]  Call these people out on the carpet and do something with them as far as bringing criminal charges against them.
[01:29:56.081 --> 01:29:58.023]  We know who the players are.
[01:29:58.063 --> 01:30:02.087]  We know who these people are that are perpetrating these crimes against this republic.
[01:30:02.687 --> 01:30:09.453]  And also, I'd like to say that it's just unbelievable how much time is wasted.
[01:30:10.051 --> 01:30:10.371]  I don't know.
[01:30:35.439 --> 01:30:36.539]  Let me give you an example, man.
[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:38.421]  Like we have organized before.
[01:30:38.601 --> 01:30:42.864]  In fact, a lot of the grassroots organizations out there are the originators of this Tea Party idea.
[01:30:43.185 --> 01:30:45.246]  Now, we don't have a mainstream television network.
[01:30:45.727 --> 01:30:46.688]  We have a message.
[01:30:46.728 --> 01:30:50.971]  You know, we have radio shows like this one, shortwave, internet stuff, websites.
[01:30:51.011 --> 01:30:52.872]  We don't have an O'Reilly Factor.
[01:30:52.893 --> 01:30:54.374]  We don't have a Glenn Beck.
[01:30:54.634 --> 01:30:55.595]  And Glenn Beck goes
[01:30:56.095 --> 01:31:02.138]  And C is that a lot of people are nervous, a lot of people are unrested, a lot of people want to trust the establishment no matter how corrupt they are.
[01:31:02.478 --> 01:31:05.480]  And he uses that to organize those people.
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:08.481]  And it's controlled opposition and they get those in the masses.
[01:31:08.501 --> 01:31:11.523]  So I still think it's very important that we wake people up.
[01:31:11.843 --> 01:31:15.625]  And if you're talking about organizing, you know, let's infiltrate these organizations.
[01:31:15.685 --> 01:31:17.686]  I'm encouraging people to go down to San Antonio.
[01:31:18.226 --> 01:31:24.292]  On April 15th, to this Tea Party, bring copies of the Civilian Inmate Labor Program document with you.
[01:31:24.332 --> 01:31:25.473]  I'm going to be bringing the copies out.
[01:31:25.493 --> 01:31:26.614]  I'm going to be handing them out to people.
[01:31:27.095 --> 01:31:29.977]  And let's try to get these people into our organizations.
[01:31:30.609 --> 01:31:34.292]  You know, because we all talk about we need to organize, we need to do this.
[01:31:34.772 --> 01:31:39.315]  We do know who some of the players are and we have tried to organize things.
[01:31:39.335 --> 01:31:48.462]  I mean, you know, we put Ron Paul out into the public eye and really gave him a push so that he was one of the last real candidates in the primaries.
[01:31:49.002 --> 01:31:53.986]  You know, I think it's all about getting a unified message and bringing more people into the fold.
[01:31:54.386 --> 01:31:56.147]  Go ahead.
[01:31:56.167 --> 01:31:58.809]  Even get voted for and that's what's going on basically.
[01:32:00.616 --> 01:32:02.017]  I'm going to start my own revolt.
[01:32:02.278 --> 01:32:04.499]  This year I'm not going to file a federal tax return.
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:07.201]  I'm not going to fund my own destruction from now on.
[01:32:07.221 --> 01:32:11.965]  And if all the American people got pissed off and said, I ain't funding this crap no more.
[01:32:12.365 --> 01:32:18.050]  I'm not going to fund the destruction of my own country and fund these criminal people and not file a federal tax return.
[01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:19.631]  They can't put us all in jail.
[01:32:20.091 --> 01:32:21.292]  And if they try, who cares?
[01:32:21.553 --> 01:32:21.953]  Bring it on.
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:23.841]  I'm with you there, Glosser.
[01:32:23.861 --> 01:32:24.701]  I thank you for the call.
[01:32:24.741 --> 01:32:26.482]  All right, we've got a bunch of callers from Indiana.
[01:32:26.522 --> 01:32:27.943]  Let's go to George in Indiana.
[01:32:27.983 --> 01:32:29.083]  George, you are on the line.
[01:32:29.504 --> 01:32:41.910]  Hey, Jason, I know you've seen probably all the videos, but my chin hit the floor when I seen this latest one on YouTube about Bush in the school right before they started to read The Pet Goat.
[01:32:42.301 --> 01:32:43.682]  Yeah, well let me stop you right there first.
[01:32:44.222 --> 01:32:50.786]  Before that, his brother Jeb Bush had declared martial law in a state of emergency in Florida two days before 9-11, okay?
[01:32:51.447 --> 01:32:56.470]  There was a weird instance where someone wanted to photograph Bush in the very beginning.
[01:32:56.530 --> 01:32:57.950]  People have said, you know, was this a
[01:32:59.051 --> 01:32:59.531]  I don't know.
[01:33:25.481 --> 01:33:27.624]  I think 9 eastern time that evening.
[01:33:42.265 --> 01:33:45.129]  And Andy Card comes in and he tells him something.
[01:33:45.189 --> 01:33:48.673]  People have speculated, oh it's the second tower or oh we're under attack.
[01:33:49.254 --> 01:33:55.902]  He sits there for another 15 plus minutes before he leaves with his security force.
[01:33:56.122 --> 01:33:57.323]  Now that tells me two things.
[01:33:58.484 --> 01:34:02.328]  Number one, it tells me that this is not a surprise, otherwise he would have left immediately.
[01:34:02.368 --> 01:34:06.731]  And number two, it tells me that the Secret Service must have known he was safe there.
[01:34:07.352 --> 01:34:07.612]  Okay?
[01:34:07.852 --> 01:34:13.937]  If this was a real attack, if this was a real terrorist event, you've got hijacked airliners, you've got threats to the President, you'd get him out of there.
[01:34:13.957 --> 01:34:16.039]  It was highly publicized where he was in Florida.
[01:34:16.339 --> 01:34:24.787]  But they put all these things into play, like the martial law and, you know, the school photo op in Jeb Bush's state, on purpose.
[01:34:24.847 --> 01:34:25.107]  Go ahead.
[01:34:26.712 --> 01:34:31.773]  Now this adds the icing to the cake, because it was done in a cult-like fashion.
[01:34:32.453 --> 01:34:48.557]  This latest video on YouTube is the kids saying words that the teacher is pointing onto the board, and they always had the sound off on this, but what it's saying is, Kite, Hit, Steal, Plane, Must.
[01:34:49.117 --> 01:34:52.477]  That's a cultish for, Kite, Plane, Must, Hit, Steal.
[01:34:53.117 --> 01:34:55.898]  In other words, the planes were remote-controlled, like a kite,
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:35:02.401]  And if you watch this video, you can see Bush almost turn into the devil.
[01:35:02.641 --> 01:35:04.102]  I mean, you wouldn't believe the facial expression.
[01:35:04.142 --> 01:35:05.162]  I've seen the video.
[01:35:05.202 --> 01:35:05.622]  I've seen it.
[01:35:05.642 --> 01:35:06.542]  Listen, I've seen the video.
[01:35:06.582 --> 01:35:07.803]  I know exactly what you're talking about.
[01:35:07.843 --> 01:35:08.603]  It's very unnerving.
[01:35:08.863 --> 01:35:10.783]  You know, he's reading my pet goat.
[01:35:10.903 --> 01:35:12.444]  Is that a symbolism for Baphomet?
[01:35:12.784 --> 01:35:13.604]  Very possibly.
[01:35:13.904 --> 01:35:14.904]  You know they're into the occult.
[01:35:15.184 --> 01:35:16.525]  I try to stick to what I can prove.
[01:35:16.605 --> 01:35:17.245]  Is it interesting?
[01:35:17.285 --> 01:35:18.505]  Yeah, it is interesting.
[01:35:18.545 --> 01:35:19.726]  I thank you for the call, my man.
[01:35:20.086 --> 01:35:22.746]  All right, let's go to Brandon in Indiana.
[01:35:22.826 --> 01:35:24.747]  It's the trifecta of Indiana calls.
[01:35:24.827 --> 01:35:25.747]  Brandon, you're on the line.
[01:35:27.304 --> 01:35:33.726]  Well, I thought I'd mention something about all this occult talk.
[01:35:33.846 --> 01:35:35.966]  Really, it's just an operating system.
[01:35:37.306 --> 01:35:40.447]  You can't demonize the system.
[01:35:40.787 --> 01:35:45.228]  It's ultimately the people and what their goals are.
[01:35:45.588 --> 01:35:54.551]  Most of the people we're referring to, their goals are basically to destroy human will and humanity itself.
[01:35:56.971 --> 01:36:04.637]  I'd like to draw everybody's attention to... I mean, I believe mostly how they're doing what they're doing is through contracting.
[01:36:05.497 --> 01:36:06.818]  Everyone's got free will.
[01:36:07.759 --> 01:36:16.165]  They offer these benefits, they offer these contracts, and I'll just tell you, Indiana, Mitch Daniels has been privatizing all of our benefits.
[01:36:17.826 --> 01:36:22.750]  But people are basically signing their rights away to the government, and they see that as their
[01:36:24.415 --> 01:36:26.297]  Ability to do what they will with you.
[01:36:26.317 --> 01:36:31.101]  If you're going to give your rights to them, then they're going to do what they want to do.
[01:36:44.482 --> 01:36:45.803]  We do have one weapon though.
[01:36:45.823 --> 01:36:47.964]  It is in the Uniform Commercial Code, an explicit reservation of rights.
[01:36:48.024 --> 01:36:48.845]  You basically sign
[01:37:13.956 --> 01:37:17.597]  Your name and you write without prejudice above your name and underline it.
[01:37:18.257 --> 01:37:19.377]  It's in the commercial code.
[01:37:19.397 --> 01:37:20.498]  It's how they operate.
[01:37:20.518 --> 01:37:21.958]  The court system uses it.
[01:37:22.918 --> 01:37:24.699]  But the thing is, you need to know what you're doing.
[01:37:24.719 --> 01:37:27.000]  We're talking about common law, right?
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:28.260]  Yeah.
[01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:28.960]  Yeah.
[01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:31.401]  I mean, you can set all these declarations out there.
[01:37:31.421 --> 01:37:36.062]  There's a film out there called Hijacking Humanity that has a large section on common law.
[01:37:36.322 --> 01:37:37.702]  I encourage people to check that out.
[01:37:37.983 --> 01:37:39.023]  Thank you for the call, my man.
[01:37:39.103 --> 01:37:39.303]  All right.
[01:37:39.343 --> 01:37:41.003]  We got a few more callers on the line.
[01:37:41.023 --> 01:37:42.624]  Let's go to Jordan in Texas.
[01:37:42.664 --> 01:37:43.204]  Jordan, you're up.
[01:37:44.008 --> 01:37:44.708]  Hey, what's up man?
[01:37:44.748 --> 01:37:47.309]  Hey, I need to get your thoughts on something real quick.
[01:37:48.649 --> 01:37:54.450]  This summer, actually June, I'm going to a wedding with my family in Cozumel.
[01:37:55.870 --> 01:38:00.331]  Do you think that it's something, do you think I'm going to lose my head?
[01:38:00.571 --> 01:38:02.271]  Where are you going to this wedding?
[01:38:03.092 --> 01:38:04.632]  In Cozumel, Mexico.
[01:38:04.892 --> 01:38:09.113]  And I got, you know my brother said he would go if you guys okayed it.
[01:38:11.610 --> 01:38:13.231]  Listen, you can't live your life in fear.
[01:38:13.251 --> 01:38:15.893]  There are plenty of people that go out into danger zones and return.
[01:38:15.933 --> 01:38:17.114]  Is Mexico a dangerous place?
[01:38:17.154 --> 01:38:17.995]  In some places, yeah.
[01:38:18.675 --> 01:38:19.836]  Is the Middle East a dangerous place?
[01:38:19.856 --> 01:38:20.757]  In some places, yeah.
[01:38:20.977 --> 01:38:22.418]  But you can't live your life in fear.
[01:38:22.658 --> 01:38:26.581]  I mean, there are people that go on vacations, they get bit by a spider, they get malaria, they die.
[01:38:26.841 --> 01:38:28.002]  Is that how you want to live your life?
[01:38:28.042 --> 01:38:29.043]  In total and complete fear?
[01:38:29.263 --> 01:38:33.086]  Listen, man, go, have a good time, and just be aware.
[01:38:33.106 --> 01:38:36.849]  I hope you don't come back dead, because then I sound like a total douche.
[01:38:38.230 --> 01:38:38.891]  I'm just saying.
[01:38:39.111 --> 01:38:40.371]  You can't live your life in fear.
[01:38:40.952 --> 01:38:46.675]  I wouldn't be going into a war zone where there are guns firing all over the place, but you should be able to go to Mexico.
[01:38:47.855 --> 01:38:48.356]  You heard that.
[01:38:48.436 --> 01:38:49.276]  Pack up your family.
[01:38:49.296 --> 01:38:50.097]  We're going to Mexico.
[01:38:51.778 --> 01:38:52.478]  Good luck, man.
[01:38:52.918 --> 01:38:53.378]  You got it.
[01:38:53.398 --> 01:38:56.240]  Alright, let's go to Jason in Missouri.
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:56.980]  Jason, you're up.
[01:38:57.861 --> 01:38:58.481]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:38:58.921 --> 01:38:59.342]  Good, man.
[01:39:00.562 --> 01:39:01.623]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[01:39:01.663 --> 01:39:05.885]  I've seen loose change and I've used it to wake up a couple of good friends of mine.
[01:39:08.762 --> 01:39:14.244]  It's great to see other people get the same feeling out of it that I did.
[01:39:14.985 --> 01:39:25.749]  I was calling because lately I've been noticing a trend, even with the people that I've woke up, is that people are just repeating what you say, or what Alex says.
[01:39:26.089 --> 01:39:28.510]  I don't necessarily have a problem with that.
[01:39:29.110 --> 01:39:33.812]  My problem comes from people not actually going and looking for themselves.
[01:39:35.329 --> 01:39:36.350]  I have a big problem with that.
[01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:38.293]  I think that you need to verify everything I say.
[01:39:38.333 --> 01:39:41.136]  I'm not going to get everything 100% right, neither is Alex Jones.
[01:39:41.476 --> 01:39:49.004]  And that's why, basically what I do before I come into every show is I just go scan the regular news wires.
[01:39:49.044 --> 01:39:52.168]  I go to routers, I go to MSNBC, I go to Fox.
[01:39:52.728 --> 01:39:54.529]  I go to the Telegraph and I go to the Guardian.
[01:39:54.549 --> 01:39:56.010]  Those are my big five sites now.
[01:39:56.350 --> 01:39:58.672]  Other than that, I also check my MySpace and my Facebook.
[01:39:58.692 --> 01:40:01.934]  So a lot of the information I present here really isn't even my own.
[01:40:02.334 --> 01:40:08.799]  It is coming out of the mainstream media, but it's really coming out of all the little info warriors all across the country that are sending me this stuff.
[01:40:09.599 --> 01:40:16.984]  For instance, Section 1710 of the Give Act, I wouldn't have known about that unless one of my callers came in and said, listen, you need to
[01:40:17.344 --> 01:40:19.005]  Well, that's kind of how I feel about it, too.
[01:40:41.624 --> 01:40:48.345]  comes up to somebody who's not awake and just completely recites word-for-word what was said on the radio show.
[01:40:48.806 --> 01:40:53.146]  Great, you've said what you've heard, but you have nothing to back that claim up at all.
[01:40:53.847 --> 01:41:01.008]  You may not have a date, you may not have anything that's actually tangible to prove to somebody.
[01:41:01.448 --> 01:41:08.590]  And then, I mean, if you actually have studied something and you are educated on it, you have no problem defending your point of view.
[01:41:08.730 --> 01:41:09.610]  And people kind of
[01:41:10.279 --> 01:41:15.649]  Respond better to someone who's confident with what they're saying and a lot of people are like well, why can't I wake this person up?
[01:41:15.689 --> 01:41:19.917]  Well, it's because you're you're not completely awake yet yourself in my eyes
[01:41:20.717 --> 01:41:25.139]  Well it took me a long time to get to the point where I was comfortable doing this on a massive level.
[01:41:25.179 --> 01:41:27.299]  It took me a short period of time.
[01:41:27.319 --> 01:41:31.141]  I got a pretty good memory to try to take some of these facts to my friends and my family.
[01:41:31.441 --> 01:41:37.203]  But like you said, it's very difficult when you're just sitting there talking to somebody and you don't have the article right in front of you to back up.
[01:41:37.243 --> 01:41:42.485]  It's gotten a lot easier with the advent of cell phone technology, wireless internet everywhere, laptops.
[01:41:42.765 --> 01:41:44.166]  I appreciate you taking my call, man.
[01:42:05.632 --> 01:42:13.217]  Like I said, I've used your movies and Alex's movies to wake up people and I'm going to keep doing that until it's outlawed.
[01:42:36.392 --> 01:42:39.553]  Anderson Cooper saying, wow, they declared a new world order.
[01:42:39.573 --> 01:42:42.094]  A few people in the United States are pretty concerned about that.
[01:42:43.234 --> 01:42:48.235]  No kidding we're concerned about it because a new world order means less for us and more for them.
[01:42:48.576 --> 01:42:49.696]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:49.856 --> 01:42:50.436]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[01:42:50.456 --> 01:42:51.216]  We'll be back after this.
[01:42:51.276 --> 01:42:52.657]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:43:02.344 --> 01:43:05.726]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:43:05.866 --> 01:43:11.088]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:43:11.269 --> 01:43:14.070]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate.
[01:43:17.585 --> 01:43:27.587]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.

[01:44:02.345 --> 01:44:07.590]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:08.368 --> 01:44:13.712]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:44:14.253 --> 01:44:20.437]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:20.737 --> 01:44:22.559]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:22.739 --> 01:44:25.101]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:44:25.181 --> 01:44:36.069]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:44:38.374 --> 01:44:39.635]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:40.035 --> 01:44:41.416]  It's about a one world government.
[01:44:41.896 --> 01:44:48.240]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:45:02.011 --> 01:45:02.872]  Detoxify.

[01:45:22.557 --> 01:45:28.098]  The liquid zeolite formula, Humic, helps to remove chemicals, toxins, and fluoride, bromine, and chloride.
[01:45:28.258 --> 01:45:32.220]  Add Malignant Block to stimulate these two detox and anti-cancer protection.
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:36.541]  Green Tea Supreme to bind ionic toxins and protecting DNA and membranes.
[01:45:36.581 --> 01:45:36.861]  I think so.
[01:46:06.204 --> 01:46:07.485]  Alright folks, we are back.
[01:46:08.345 --> 01:46:10.527]  It's the Alex Jones Show, final segment.
[01:46:11.027 --> 01:46:13.349]  And joining us now, Alex Jones.
[01:46:13.469 --> 01:46:14.229]  Alex, what's up?
[01:46:15.490 --> 01:46:19.113]  Hey buddy, I've been taking care of business all day and I've been taking my children fishing.
[01:46:19.853 --> 01:46:23.195]  And I was listening to the show and that last caller was a nice guy.
[01:46:24.276 --> 01:46:28.919]  But I don't completely agree with him.
[01:46:28.939 --> 01:46:33.182]  By that I mean, I don't think we should spend all our time
[01:46:35.114 --> 01:46:42.117]  Uh, being too worried about how we present things, or obsessing, or trying to convince those.
[01:46:42.397 --> 01:46:50.381]  Hey, if people want to have all their 401Ks stolen, and want to live in a world government, and want to have their goods confiscated, I mean, we've been doing people a favor.
[01:46:50.941 --> 01:46:59.544]  You know, we're doing something for humanity, warning all these stupid, self-serving, foolselves, arrogant, foolish people.
[01:47:01.434 --> 01:47:04.495]  You know, I feel sorry for that guy who's trying to wake folks up and they give them problems.
[01:47:04.995 --> 01:47:10.356]  But, you know, I give people documentation, evidence, hardcore facts, and they still deny it.
[01:47:10.877 --> 01:47:13.797]  And so I say to that guy, or to others, just move on.
[01:47:14.318 --> 01:47:14.838]  Move on.
[01:47:15.098 --> 01:47:16.878]  There's always people that want to be suckers.
[01:47:16.898 --> 01:47:18.339]  There's always people that want to be slaves.
[01:47:19.719 --> 01:47:25.761]  I don't think people are running around regurgitating what they heard on InfoWars.com or on the radio show.
[01:47:25.881 --> 01:47:26.501]  All we do is
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:37.108]  Cover legislation and documents and have guests on and literally 98% of what we cover on the radio is posted on the websites.
[01:47:38.069 --> 01:47:41.212]  And so no, we have the higher standard of journalism.
[01:47:41.272 --> 01:47:43.314]  We have the higher standard of documentation.
[01:47:43.634 --> 01:47:44.995]  We've done a fabulous job.
[01:47:45.316 --> 01:47:49.880]  It's the mainstream horror media that's now trying to play catch up.
[01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:54.564]  And so I think the most important thing relaying information to people is to be confident
[01:47:55.380 --> 01:48:02.803]  And to say, listen, we have a world government coming down on us, and we've been right all along, and we need to point that out to people.
[01:48:03.864 --> 01:48:13.528]  Look, who even needs to wake up one of these arrogant nobodies who is on a power trip thinking that, you know, they run the planet and the establishment doesn't have anything over on them?
[01:48:13.548 --> 01:48:24.353]  I mean, who wants to wake up somebody that doesn't instinctively know that government's too big and that tyranny's out of control and that freedom's under attack at every level of society and that we're in serious trouble?
[01:48:25.853 --> 01:48:29.174]  Listen, 5% won the Revolutionary War against Britain.
[01:48:29.194 --> 01:48:31.195]  We got way more than 5% right now.
[01:48:31.695 --> 01:48:39.097]  And so the main thing is just to go out and wake up those that want to be woken up, but also say no, no, no to this system and call for the arrest of these bankers.
[01:48:39.437 --> 01:48:40.938]  Jason, I appreciate you filling in today.
[01:48:40.958 --> 01:48:46.499]  You'll be back live tonight, 9 to midnight, on the Genesis Network and Sommelcast and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:48:46.519 --> 01:48:48.460]  And I'll be back live Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:59.710]  On the abbreviated Sunday Show and Monday I'm doing a big two-hour presentation on the four-hour show ahead of Glenn Beck and Pompeo Mechanics debunking the FEMA camps.
[01:48:59.950 --> 01:49:04.735]  And I told folks a month ago he was going to debunk them and they were like, no, he says they're real.
[01:49:05.115 --> 01:49:06.517]  He's going to expose them.
[01:49:06.577 --> 01:49:07.798]  You don't sit, Jones.
[01:49:08.888 --> 01:49:10.449]  No, I wish Glenn Beck was for real.
[01:49:10.509 --> 01:49:11.730]  I wish he was joining the team.
[01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:14.932]  But the guy called for Ron Paul supporters to be arrested a year ago.
[01:49:14.952 --> 01:49:17.874]  He's total New World Order, so that big expose is coming up.
[01:49:17.894 --> 01:49:19.415]  Burmas, great job on it.
[01:49:19.455 --> 01:49:20.516]  I really appreciate you filling in.
[01:49:21.141 --> 01:49:22.122]  Thank you, Mr. Jones.
[01:49:22.542 --> 01:49:30.307]  Yeah, I mean, he also associated us with Tim McVeigh types that we're going to pull off the next terror attack in the United States, completely trying to demonize us.
[01:49:30.547 --> 01:49:33.169]  I mean, Glenn Beck is a shill among shills, folks.
[01:49:33.229 --> 01:49:37.652]  If you buy into that guy, I feel bad for you and I might have a bridge to sell you as well.
[01:49:37.972 --> 01:49:40.294]  All right, let's go to one final caller.
[01:49:41.034 --> 01:49:41.855]  He's out of the Ukraine.
[01:49:41.875 --> 01:49:42.435]  I got to take him.
[01:49:42.455 --> 01:49:43.956]  Let's go to Eric in the Ukraine.
[01:49:44.256 --> 01:49:45.597]  Eric, you got about 30 seconds.
[01:49:45.637 --> 01:49:45.957]  Go ahead.
[01:49:47.418 --> 01:49:49.460]  Hi, this is Eric from Kiev, Ukraine.
[01:49:50.461 --> 01:49:52.142]  I just want to speak about freedom a little bit.
[01:49:53.663 --> 01:49:57.426]  What I found, I moved to Germany, Bavaria, in 1990.
[01:49:57.546 --> 01:50:02.250]  I was luckily one of the 10% of Americans that had a passport.
[01:50:02.370 --> 01:50:02.891]  I got out.
[01:50:03.831 --> 01:50:04.852]  And it changed my life.
[01:50:05.332 --> 01:50:07.594]  And really, you know what's so great about Europe?
[01:50:07.614 --> 01:50:08.515]  There's so much freedom.
[01:50:09.387 --> 01:50:12.530]  You can just travel wherever and get so much culture and life.
[01:50:13.271 --> 01:50:14.572]  Eric, I wish I could have kept you over.
[01:50:14.752 --> 01:50:15.753]  We're at the end of the show.
[01:50:16.494 --> 01:50:17.735]  Let you get that little blurb in.
[01:50:17.795 --> 01:50:19.536]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:19.576 --> 01:50:22.299]  The rebroadcast begins in about 40 seconds, folks.
[01:50:22.339 --> 01:50:30.746]  If you missed anything about the G20, about Anderson Cooper talking about a new world order, about Max Keiser and the controlled demolition coup d'etat, it's on the way.
[01:50:31.007 --> 01:50:32.028]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:32.228 --> 01:50:34.350]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[01:50:42.686 --> 01:50:47.529]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:47.569 --> 01:50:50.491]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:51.852 --> 01:50:53.432]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:53.573 --> 01:50:58.195]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:58.295 --> 01:51:01.037]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:51:01.257 --> 01:51:02.838]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line.
