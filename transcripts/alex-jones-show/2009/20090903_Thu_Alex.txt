[00:00:02.148 --> 00:00:14.541]  Day after day, alone on a hill, the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[00:00:15.022 --> 00:00:20.808]  But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool.
[00:00:21.377 --> 00:00:33.511]  Okay, we are now simulcasting the radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv and Living Color at PrisonPlanet.tv for the balance of the rest of the broadcast today.
[00:00:34.212 --> 00:00:41.261]  Coming up, I have Pastor Steven Anderson that's made international headlines saying that he's praying that Obama dies.
[00:00:42.327 --> 00:00:47.129]  I think that's a mistake, but I think Pastor Anderson, who we've talked to many times, is a good guy.
[00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:55.313]  I understand that's in the Bible, it's biblical, but it really plays into the hands of the establishment, wanting to crack down on our liberties.
[00:00:55.353 --> 00:00:57.014]  But Pastor Anderson's coming up.
[00:00:57.434 --> 00:00:58.235]  We'll discuss it.
[00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:00.196]  I got the national media calling me.
[00:01:01.056 --> 00:01:02.997]  Wanting me to go on national TV and comment on it.
[00:01:03.118 --> 00:01:12.684]  I want to, instead of just hearing little clips and edited soundbites, we got Pastor Anderson coming on here, and we're probably going to have Chris back on too, the black gentleman with the AR-15 on his back.
[00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:16.026]  He goes to Pastor Anderson's church.
[00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:18.788]  I didn't really point that out when I knew it a few weeks ago.
[00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.011]  I was kind of cringing, knowing the media would probably find it.
[00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:26.795]  But now it's all over CNN, Fox, all over ABC, CBS.
[00:01:27.135 --> 00:01:27.816]  That's coming up.
[00:01:27.876 --> 00:01:31.940]  We got Steve Quayle coming on about the flu, the quarantines, the forced inoculations.
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.062]  The government now admits they're gearing up for this.
[00:01:34.162 --> 00:01:37.606]  I don't know if they're going to carry it out, but they're certainly saying they plan to.
[00:01:38.783 --> 00:01:39.764]  So that's coming up too.
[00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:52.013]  But for the next 25 minutes or so, Mankal Muller, syndicated radio talk show host, joins us to talk about a host of issues, but originally I wanted to get him on because the British news and the U.S.
[00:01:52.053 --> 00:01:52.854]  news has been reporting
[00:01:53.891 --> 00:02:04.097]  They, uh, rich groups, rich, uh, rent big, big, uh, former palaces, uh, hotels, and they have big satanic orgies and, and do open ceremonies.
[00:02:04.898 --> 00:02:08.740]  And, and the British News has been, uh, reporting on this.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:15.004]  The San Francisco Chronicle reported on them drinking blood, defecating on stage, the mayor involved.
[00:02:15.484 --> 00:02:16.305]  You know, years ago.
[00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:17.545]  I mean, this stuff really happens.
[00:02:17.646 --> 00:02:23.930]  Eyes Wide Shut is based on Bohemian Grove and other real events that I've actually infiltrated, and Skull and Bones.
[00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.671]  But those are homoerotic.
[00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:26.932]  Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove.
[00:02:27.212 --> 00:02:27.993]  This is with women.
[00:02:29.053 --> 00:02:37.940]  But equally bizarre, Man Cow, because he's influential and TV show host and radio host, he got invited to one, so I wanted him on about that.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.461]  That's coming up in a few minutes, though.
[00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:43.744]  I wanted to discuss first something he's been talking about, and that's Van Jones
[00:02:44.344 --> 00:03:06.191]  And other people, and Obama and Rahm Emanuel introducing legislation for forced compulsory service, asking the Obama people to go knock on doors and twist people's arms, and the White House was going to have a national telecast to public schools called Obama Education, asking the kids to rally and support his agenda and to speak to their parents.
[00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:09.852]  Now, you dovetail that, and we have all these clips coming up the next hour, I'm going to play them.
[00:03:10.532 --> 00:03:13.314]  With Obama's czar shock admission.
[00:03:13.354 --> 00:03:14.394]  We have the clip coming up.
[00:03:14.474 --> 00:03:15.295]  Green jobs.
[00:03:15.655 --> 00:03:17.116]  Goal is complete revolution.
[00:03:17.136 --> 00:03:19.077]  A takeover of the economy.
[00:03:19.117 --> 00:03:20.458]  An end of capitalism.
[00:03:21.318 --> 00:03:24.880]  And to get the youth admitting communism.
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.461]  This isn't me.
[00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:26.301]  This is his czar.
[00:03:26.781 --> 00:03:30.744]  And then that dovetails with Al Gore saying your parents are backwards.
[00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:31.924]  Question their beliefs.
[00:03:32.565 --> 00:03:34.246]  Your parents are like people against
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.241]  Ending segregation.
[00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:58.737]  Look, Obama is still going to speak to the kids.
[00:03:58.817 --> 00:04:01.859]  They have pulled back on some of what they were going to do.
[00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:13.806]  They were going to ask children afterwards, and this was going to be mandatory for everybody from kindergarten to, you know, graduating high school, that they would have to sit through this Obama agenda.
[00:04:14.446 --> 00:04:22.131]  You picture this, and something Pol Pot would do, or something that little Kim would do, Kim Jong-il over North Korea, and you would then have to
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.004]  Every child in public schools in America would then have to write, what can I do to help Obama?
[00:04:28.044 --> 00:04:31.026]  What did I think of what Obama had to say?
[00:04:31.046 --> 00:04:35.210]  And parents have reacted very strongly, so now they have softened it.
[00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:46.739]  But yeah, the agenda... You know, Alex, it's so funny to me when we're talking about fascists or communists or radical Kenyan Muslims without birth certificates or whatever your audience wants to think Obama is.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.821]  But certainly these are big government people.
[00:04:50.202 --> 00:04:53.605]  And have they been lost on the irony of calling everybody czar?
[00:04:54.646 --> 00:04:55.947]  Do they not know irony?
[00:04:56.167 --> 00:04:57.768]  They name everybody czar.
[00:04:57.808 --> 00:04:58.789]  It's hysterical to me.
[00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:09.999]  But I mean, Chris Matthews says if you question 26 aides, when people questioned that under Bush when she had like 15, or if you question Pelosi's jumbo jet, it's racism.
[00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.642]  They're playing the race card to inject it.
[00:05:12.702 --> 00:05:13.943]  And I want you to comment on this.
[00:05:14.483 --> 00:05:27.595]  And then now, all over the news, they're saying we're liars, there's no call for compulsory youth, when Rahm Emanuel, the White House Chief of Staff, is on C-SPAN not once, not twice, but three times.
[00:05:27.975 --> 00:05:29.897]  Obama's on TV five times.
[00:05:29.937 --> 00:05:34.842]  We've dug out all the videos, saying he wants compulsory military, domestic,
[00:05:35.482 --> 00:05:36.503]  I don't know.
[00:05:51.673 --> 00:05:54.995]  Yeah, well, I mean, race is going to be very easy for this president.
[00:05:55.155 --> 00:05:57.696]  I saw it when I had 10,000 people show up for my tea party.
[00:05:58.056 --> 00:06:01.077]  I've attended two of these town hall meetings about health care.
[00:06:01.097 --> 00:06:05.299]  And of course, if you dare to question Air Obama, you're called a racist.
[00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.959]  It's ridiculous.
[00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:12.442]  But yeah, this would have been, they wanted kids to write letters, every kid in public schools, how to help the president.
[00:06:13.803 --> 00:06:15.524]  And then after the speech, they were
[00:06:16.306 --> 00:06:22.068]  They were supposed to talk about, here's the subject, what the president wants from me, the big video screens, everything you're talking about.
[00:06:22.188 --> 00:06:24.429]  Look, America is getting wise to it, Alex.
[00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:25.689]  You need to know this.
[00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:29.150]  I get very depressed, and then I went to these town hall meetings, I went out on the streets.
[00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.251]  Hope and change have morphed into creepy and overreaching.
[00:06:32.632 --> 00:06:36.973]  Commie boy here out of my city of Chicago is no longer fooling America.
[00:06:36.993 --> 00:06:39.174]  Look at Fogbee, look at Rasmussen, CNN.
[00:06:39.214 --> 00:06:40.554]  I mean, CNN, come on!
[00:06:41.174 --> 00:06:42.455]  Commie News Network right there.
[00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:45.716]  CNN today is saying that he's lost independence.
[00:06:46.396 --> 00:06:51.019]  I understand people not wanting to be part of what Bush was doing, the big spending, the Republicans.
[00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:52.900]  I was sick of Bush's spending.
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.982]  But so who are you going to identify with?
[00:06:56.442 --> 00:07:06.108]  This Democratic Party independent gave this guy a shot, he overreached, and I think they're ready to send him and his strong-arm goons back to Chicago.
[00:07:06.636 --> 00:07:10.477]  Well, Mankell, I agree with you, but I want your take on this.
[00:07:10.617 --> 00:07:17.360]  I think the real reason, if you really study the Rasmussen and Gallup polls, he's as low as 39 in many demographics.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:25.943]  His highest demographic is 45 in these different polls, but the average is about 42, and he's losing close to a point a week.
[00:07:26.443 --> 00:07:33.525]  This is the fastest drop of any president eight and a half months into their administration since Gallup and Rasmussen existed.
[00:07:34.886 --> 00:07:39.527]  So this is record crashing and burning because people are finding out he's a hoax.
[00:07:39.967 --> 00:07:46.189]  The evidence I'm getting is the reason people are really waking up to him, even his former supporters and hardcore liberals.
[00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:51.974]  Is that they realize he says he isn't for gun control, but the bills are all public.
[00:07:52.274 --> 00:07:55.897]  He says he doesn't want to restrict free speech, but the bills are introduced.
[00:07:56.158 --> 00:08:06.707]  He says he doesn't want Hitlerjugend, but the bills are introduced and he's calling for them to stand in stadiums before jumbotrons and be given marching orders.
[00:08:09.049 --> 00:08:11.550]  Alex, can I play a little something for you down the phone line here?
[00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.370]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.092]  I mean, you know, this is one of my favorite moments from Obama.
[00:08:15.212 --> 00:08:23.455]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we set.
[00:08:24.125 --> 00:08:31.208]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:08:31.368 --> 00:08:34.289]  I mean, I'll tell you, they wanted to start like a crystal lock with me.
[00:08:34.369 --> 00:08:38.611]  The acorn goons were there when we had, you know, we had 10,000 people that are sick of high taxes.
[00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:42.952]  These same people, by the way, were fed up under Bush, were sick of the big spending.
[00:08:42.972 --> 00:08:47.254]  Yeah, oh no, this guy wants a private army to do his bidding.
[00:08:47.554 --> 00:08:48.214]  It is frightening.
[00:08:48.254 --> 00:08:49.555]  It's the same thing with these bars.
[00:08:50.075 --> 00:08:51.716]  These stars are not elected.
[00:08:51.736 --> 00:08:52.536]  They do whatever they want.
[00:08:52.556 --> 00:08:58.798]  How about the diversity star with the FCC, who came out and said he admired Chavez and how Chavez destroyed radio.
[00:08:59.158 --> 00:09:11.623]  Now today, this new Senate bill, I'm sure Alex Jones is already all over it, but they are declaring that under a cybersecurity emergency, what that is, they're not going to say, but basically the president
[00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.271]  You know, I love all these young people.
[00:09:14.291 --> 00:09:17.052]  Obama's, he's cute, he can read a teleprompter!
[00:09:17.513 --> 00:09:21.334]  And they love that this was the first internet American Idol president.
[00:09:21.755 --> 00:09:30.319]  And I wonder if the youth that were so enamored with Obama, even though they don't know history or anything he stands for, the fact that this president is trying to seize the internet.
[00:09:30.859 --> 00:09:32.960]  I wonder seriously if his comrades will wake up.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.761]  Yes, we must take the internet!
[00:09:35.681 --> 00:09:37.142]  I mean, you know, click your heels together.
[00:09:37.162 --> 00:09:38.342]  Heil Obama!
[00:09:38.743 --> 00:09:41.264]  This is real and it is frightening.
[00:09:42.267 --> 00:09:47.942]  No, absolutely, and that's my point, is that he denies his agenda while it rolls forward and...
[00:09:49.955 --> 00:09:55.981]  I think it's going to cause revolution in this country and I think that's what the social engineers want.
[00:09:56.501 --> 00:09:57.802]  They want this to get violent.
[00:09:58.182 --> 00:09:59.143]  I don't want it to get violent.
[00:09:59.504 --> 00:10:00.304]  I don't want it to get violent.
[00:10:00.324 --> 00:10:01.245]  I want people to wake up.
[00:10:01.566 --> 00:10:02.606]  I want the men of America.
[00:10:02.647 --> 00:10:05.990]  I know there's estrogen in our water bottles and I see a lot of feminized men.
[00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.272]  I'd like men to grow a set.
[00:10:08.312 --> 00:10:13.837]  I'd like men to be men again and vote these clowns out of office and let's get back to cowboy logic and common sense.
[00:10:13.897 --> 00:10:15.078]  I don't want any blood to be shed.
[00:10:16.425 --> 00:10:33.414]  Well I agree with you and I think the establishment, well I mean all over the country we've caught their unions on video coming up and beating people, beating black people that are against the government takeover of health care, attacking women and now in California
[00:10:34.748 --> 00:10:42.931]  A pro-Obama person went into the crowd, attacked this man, and bit his finger off.
[00:10:43.572 --> 00:10:45.252]  It's unbelievable.
[00:10:45.832 --> 00:10:48.954]  But I mean, listen, I have been reading their websites.
[00:10:49.094 --> 00:10:51.455]  They are saying, burn my house down.
[00:10:51.855 --> 00:10:55.256]  The Obama supporters are saying, come after me.
[00:10:55.956 --> 00:10:57.897]  I know they're saying, come after other people.
[00:10:57.937 --> 00:10:59.518]  They're saying, get us off the air.
[00:11:00.198 --> 00:11:05.422]  Uh, they're trying to bully the owner of, uh, Whole Foods saying he doesn't have a First Amendment.
[00:11:05.703 --> 00:11:08.305]  I mean, they really are, they're trying to boycott.
[00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:09.165]  How about that?
[00:11:09.706 --> 00:11:10.446]  How about that, Alex?
[00:11:10.506 --> 00:11:12.248]  Is your wife into the whole Whole Foods thing?
[00:11:12.628 --> 00:11:13.208]  Yes, we love it.
[00:11:13.549 --> 00:11:20.354]  Oh, I mean, everything is so expensive and we really found out that organic and all of these different words they use, uh,
[00:11:20.914 --> 00:11:22.215]  It's a lie.
[00:11:22.696 --> 00:11:24.237]  You know, everything is grown in the dirt.
[00:11:24.297 --> 00:11:24.958]  It's organic.
[00:11:25.619 --> 00:11:27.400]  But we're willing to pay triple everything.
[00:11:27.441 --> 00:11:30.143]  My wife is, of course, you know, I spoil the woman.
[00:11:30.564 --> 00:11:31.665]  And she loves Whole Foods.
[00:11:31.745 --> 00:11:38.611]  And boy, every time I'm there, some liberal is trying to sell me on some kind of a... You know, let me... Quickly, a quick Whole Foods story.
[00:11:38.631 --> 00:11:39.452]  Can I tell it?
[00:11:39.472 --> 00:11:39.812]  30 seconds?
[00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:40.373]  Sure.
[00:11:40.673 --> 00:11:45.198]  They wanted me to give $200 to buy school supplies for kids in the ghetto.
[00:11:45.798 --> 00:11:54.268]  And what we found out is the money that was given to school supplies to the kids in the ghetto, they didn't put any restrictions on it, so they were buying video games and then tennis shoes.
[00:11:54.569 --> 00:11:56.631]  So I said to the guy, so you really should.
[00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:57.993]  I said, sir, I'm not interested.
[00:11:58.313 --> 00:12:00.275]  And he goes, well, here's the pamphlet anyway.
[00:12:00.296 --> 00:12:02.178]  I said, sir, I don't want the pamphlet.
[00:12:02.538 --> 00:12:15.291]  So the liberals just love Whole Foods, and now their head guy, the head of Whole Foods, it's his company, he's come out and said, I don't want any part of Obama's commie care, and now they're upset, they're saying, boycott Whole Foods, but they have no idea where to go!
[00:12:15.632 --> 00:12:16.893]  It's pretty hilarious, really.
[00:12:16.933 --> 00:12:17.834]  Whole Paycheck Foods.
[00:12:18.174 --> 00:12:21.478]  Where are the liberals gonna shop now, Alex?
[00:12:21.538 --> 00:12:22.379]  I feel awful for them.
[00:12:23.442 --> 00:12:31.192]  Well, to be clear, ManCal, cross-species genetically engineered crops do have sterolins engineered into them.
[00:12:31.212 --> 00:12:32.374]  They're pharmacological.
[00:12:33.135 --> 00:12:38.742]  Do you really think a cucumber at Whole Foods is any different from Safeway or Dominic's or any other store?
[00:12:39.435 --> 00:12:44.099]  If you study... No, they certainly have some stuff that isn't really organic in there, but overall it's better.
[00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:46.700]  And you're right, it is a racket.
[00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:56.968]  Hold on, it is a racket to a certain extent, but it moved us into demanding local and organic, and it's a power of choice, and I think overall... Well, here's the deal.
[00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:11.322]  I'm against the boycott of Whole Foods because the establishment is trying to boycott Rush Limbaugh, boycott Glenn Beck, boycott Whole Foods to punish people's First Amendment to create a chilling effect.
[00:13:11.342 --> 00:13:16.748]  So even though I disagree with a lot of what Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck say, I'm supporting them.
[00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.412]  Well, that's right, and you know, that's what people seem to forget.
[00:13:19.452 --> 00:13:22.214]  It's your free speech as long as it's what you like.
[00:13:22.915 --> 00:13:24.817]  And it's really gotten frightening.
[00:13:24.917 --> 00:13:28.380]  It used to be equal rights, and of all four equal rights, but now it's special rights.
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:33.264]  I have two twin daughters, as you know, four years old, and because they're white,
[00:13:33.944 --> 00:13:34.965]  Well, it's a new classism!
[00:13:50.434 --> 00:13:54.977]  And look, let me ask you about Glenn Beck, because Glenn Beck is a fan of mine.
[00:13:55.097 --> 00:13:55.837]  Glenn Beck likes me.
[00:13:55.857 --> 00:13:57.198]  He's always been very complimentary.
[00:13:57.578 --> 00:14:01.461]  I just find him very disingenuous sometimes, although I think he's trying to do good things.
[00:14:01.801 --> 00:14:03.422]  He just cries a little too much for me.
[00:14:03.462 --> 00:14:04.383]  I'm more of a man.
[00:14:04.703 --> 00:14:05.023]  I don't know.
[00:14:05.043 --> 00:14:05.764]  What do you think about that?
[00:14:19.833 --> 00:14:21.415]  I don't know.
[00:14:27.287 --> 00:14:29.429]  You think he's actually done it?
[00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:44.661]  Look, all I know is I predicted two months before he did it that he would go show the Indiana train station the thing we debunked in 1996 and that he would say that okay there's no FEMA camps because we went and showed you one of the fake ones out there.
[00:14:44.701 --> 00:14:45.562]  That's a straw man.
[00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:50.166]  When we sent Glenn back, registered mail, and had our listeners email him by the thousands,
[00:14:50.666 --> 00:15:13.927]  The civilian inmate labor camp program, the Houston Chronicle, the New York Times, the government purchase orders, the congressional hearings on the FEMA camps, the bills introduced, and then he had popular whitewash, Hearst Publishing, yellow journalism captains on to say it didn't exist, and he said arrest Ron Paul supporters, use the army on them, when Ron Paul had a chance to win.
[00:15:13.987 --> 00:15:16.469]  So I see him as a Benedict Arnold, yes.
[00:15:16.989 --> 00:15:19.614]  But wait a minute, then why is the left so against him?
[00:15:19.654 --> 00:15:21.117]  Why are they against him?
[00:15:21.137 --> 00:15:29.112]  That's a controlled left-right paradigm and there's certainly fissures in the structure and... I'm confused.
[00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:34.898]  Are you confused by a Don King fight where both boxers are bought and paid for?
[00:15:35.098 --> 00:15:36.138]  No, no, no.
[00:15:36.198 --> 00:15:38.819]  Look, I was, remember Morton Downey Jr.?
[00:15:38.879 --> 00:15:41.500]  I was his co-host his final year and it was all fake.
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.841]  I've done over 100 episodes of Springer.
[00:15:43.861 --> 00:15:46.222]  Springer used to broadcast in the building where I do my radio show.
[00:15:46.662 --> 00:15:50.143]  And you know, WWE, I saw Hulk Hogan and the Iron Cheek.
[00:15:50.263 --> 00:15:50.903]  I get it.
[00:15:50.963 --> 00:15:55.345]  I get it that the Republicans and the dummy craps are the same.
[00:15:55.585 --> 00:15:58.346]  The puppet master, the corporations, and the globalists, I get that.
[00:15:59.735 --> 00:16:04.656]  Well, I'm just telling you, Glenn Beck knew concentration camps were real, man-cow.
[00:16:05.156 --> 00:16:10.097]  He knew they were real, and he was given the evidence, and I predicted what he would do.
[00:16:10.597 --> 00:16:13.198]  I said, he's going to do this, and he did it.
[00:16:14.358 --> 00:16:16.779]  And I want to like Glenn Beck, okay?
[00:16:16.839 --> 00:16:18.339]  I'm not here to alienate people.
[00:16:18.779 --> 00:16:24.640]  I know his audience is my audience, so I'm defending him because I'm not going to let them use him.
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.661]  You know, I don't think Glenn Beck... I'd like to punch him in the face.
[00:16:30.034 --> 00:16:31.395]  I just said that.
[00:16:31.475 --> 00:16:32.396]  I got nothing to say.
[00:16:32.456 --> 00:16:38.039]  I mean, I... Look, I... Yeah, I got nothing, Alex.
[00:16:38.139 --> 00:16:38.719]  I got nothing.
[00:16:38.739 --> 00:16:44.623]  Do you think Glenn Beck prances around in a cooking apron and knits?
[00:16:44.683 --> 00:16:49.726]  Because that's what... I mean, that's okay if men are... He's that kind of guy, but... Is that what you're saying, Mad Cow?
[00:16:50.967 --> 00:16:52.468]  I don't even know what I'm saying anymore!
[00:16:52.968 --> 00:16:54.069]  Alex, my head hurts!
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:01.382]  I'm saying that I think, uh, I tend to have real emotion on this program, and the people that call, I believe, are genuine.
[00:17:01.442 --> 00:17:03.842]  And I assume that you're a sincere individual as well.
[00:17:04.303 --> 00:17:11.824]  I just find it, um, a little bit disingenuous as a guy that's seen his TV show and had him on this radio show, and he's very complimentary of me.
[00:17:11.844 --> 00:17:13.805]  He's been nothing but nice to me, so I feel like a jerk.
[00:17:14.125 --> 00:17:20.227]  But I think he cries on cue, and it's a little ridiculous, and I think it's a little bit fake.
[00:17:21.867 --> 00:17:23.189]  And that's all I was saying.
[00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:40.353]  Mancow, I think for real, you're a maniac.
[00:17:40.373 --> 00:17:44.494]  And I think you are for real, for real, a maniac.
[00:17:44.534 --> 00:17:46.315]  I don't think you're controlled opposition.
[00:17:46.355 --> 00:17:51.696]  No, I think you're controlled by your own wild self.
[00:17:51.736 --> 00:17:52.137]  Stay there!
[00:17:52.157 --> 00:17:55.538]  I'm going to come back and talk about the satanic event you went to.
[00:17:55.858 --> 00:17:56.318]  Stay with us.

[00:18:57.858 --> 00:19:05.024]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:19:05.404 --> 00:19:07.086]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:19:08.024 --> 00:19:09.045]  But who is the enemy?
[00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:10.066]  Bin Laden.
[00:19:10.366 --> 00:19:11.347]  This is his ammo.
[00:19:11.367 --> 00:19:12.668]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:19:12.708 --> 00:19:14.389]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:21.475]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:19:21.875 --> 00:19:22.316]  Some U.S.
[00:19:22.356 --> 00:19:28.001]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:19:28.701 --> 00:19:32.182]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:19:32.202 --> 00:19:34.362]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:19:58.903 --> 00:20:03.269]  EJSeed.com would like to offer all listeners the Big Seed Deal.

[00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:13.433]  Mancow says it's really happened to him, and I know about these parties in LA, San Francisco.
[00:21:14.033 --> 00:21:15.113]  I know about them in San Diego.
[00:21:15.153 --> 00:21:15.994]  I know about them in England.
[00:21:16.014 --> 00:21:17.214]  It's now made national news.
[00:21:17.254 --> 00:21:18.554]  It's been in the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:21:18.875 --> 00:21:20.775]  Blood drinking, crapping on stage.
[00:21:22.056 --> 00:21:23.796]  Mancow got invited to a party.
[00:21:23.836 --> 00:21:25.097]  They didn't tell him what it was.
[00:21:25.717 --> 00:21:27.237]  Big sex party in a warehouse.
[00:21:27.658 --> 00:21:29.558]  Mancow, tell folks about what's going on.
[00:21:33.285 --> 00:21:34.146]  Just a little bit, okay?
[00:21:34.166 --> 00:21:35.267]  Let me just set this up.
[00:21:35.467 --> 00:21:40.692]  Comic-Con now is the place where everybody in Hollywood has to unveil their errors.
[00:21:40.732 --> 00:21:44.675]  They have to show all the new stuff, and the who's who of Hollywood is there.
[00:21:45.116 --> 00:21:53.603]  And there were people, and I don't want to incriminate anybody, because I think a lot of these big-time Hollywood people, and I'm talking about every name you know,
[00:21:54.684 --> 00:22:00.548]  I think they might have gotten suckered into it like me, so I don't want to cast negativity on them, although some of them look like they were having a lot of fun.
[00:22:00.568 --> 00:22:04.170]  So I was invited to this party called the Sanguine Party, which is the color of blood.
[00:22:04.931 --> 00:22:06.192]  And I think I'm saying it right.
[00:22:06.232 --> 00:22:06.892]  Does that sound right?
[00:22:06.932 --> 00:22:07.332]  Sanguine?
[00:22:07.552 --> 00:22:08.113]  Is that the word?
[00:22:08.133 --> 00:22:08.533]  Yes.
[00:22:08.913 --> 00:22:11.375]  And the cab driver said, no, no, look, I'm from San Diego.
[00:22:11.395 --> 00:22:12.916]  This address doesn't exist.
[00:22:12.996 --> 00:22:15.097]  And I went out, and we drove around, and we couldn't find it.
[00:22:15.117 --> 00:22:15.558]  It took an hour.
[00:22:15.578 --> 00:22:16.758]  No, no, this is the address.
[00:22:16.838 --> 00:22:17.519]  I have a ticket.
[00:22:17.559 --> 00:22:19.840]  This is the... And there was a homeless guy outside.
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.761]  He goes, hey, are you here for the party?
[00:22:22.242 --> 00:22:22.422]  What?
[00:22:23.427 --> 00:22:24.787]  You've got to be kidding me, there's nothing around.
[00:22:24.847 --> 00:22:34.590]  I was led down a corridor, there was another corridor, there was different chambers I went through, and what I walked into was like something out of a horror movie.
[00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:44.493]  There were nuns, people dressed as nuns, with their women... nuns, but with the... the outfits were cut so that their private areas were revealed.
[00:22:45.464 --> 00:22:51.166]  There was one guy who was a very feminine man who was kissing other men and he was dressed as the Pope.
[00:22:51.866 --> 00:22:57.727]  And it was an unbelievable costume and across it, across the hat, the word dunce was written.
[00:22:59.008 --> 00:23:02.349]  There were people biting each other until they bled.
[00:23:02.429 --> 00:23:04.029]  There was sex acts going on.
[00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:05.010]  There was lots of drugs.
[00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:06.010]  The lights were...
[00:23:07.208 --> 00:23:09.830]  We're strobing, and it basically, to me, was very satanic.
[00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:13.853]  Now, I had a girl who looked very much like my wife.
[00:23:13.953 --> 00:23:14.874]  It's an unbelievable look.
[00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:19.397]  You know, this Jessica Albatype, long black hair.
[00:23:21.078 --> 00:23:27.283]  She had no top on, but little black panties with an angel's face and black leather chaps.
[00:23:28.078 --> 00:23:28.699]  You run a Hellfire Club!
[00:23:48.772 --> 00:24:03.361]  I don't know Alex, for the life of me I don't know and I will tell you that I ran into a man who was one of my informants from the government who refers to himself as David X and he investigates these things and I didn't know he was there and I still don't know what he looks like.
[00:24:03.801 --> 00:24:10.646]  But I left and he called me and he's an informant for me for the show and he doesn't use his real name and he said, I'm glad you got out of there.
[00:24:10.666 --> 00:24:11.346]  I said, who are you?
[00:24:11.666 --> 00:24:12.086]  Who are you?
[00:24:12.126 --> 00:24:12.767]  How did you get my number?
[00:24:12.787 --> 00:24:13.808]  And he's the guy with the government.
[00:24:13.828 --> 00:24:17.410]  He says, that woman that was dancing towards you was a shifter.
[00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.411]  And I said, well, how do you know?
[00:24:19.431 --> 00:24:20.152]  How did you see me?
[00:24:20.172 --> 00:24:20.952]  It was the darkness.
[00:24:21.333 --> 00:24:22.654]  That woman that was trying to do to you.
[00:24:22.694 --> 00:24:23.575]  Thank God you got out of there.
[00:24:23.595 --> 00:24:24.315]  She was a shifter.
[00:24:24.715 --> 00:24:26.737]  And I think about David Icke, who you've had on your show.
[00:24:26.757 --> 00:24:27.418]  I've had on my show.
[00:24:27.438 --> 00:24:31.541]  You know, there are some people believe that there are these people that are not what they seem.
[00:24:31.861 --> 00:24:34.103]  They look good, but underneath...
[00:24:34.543 --> 00:24:36.805]  Pure evil.
[00:24:36.845 --> 00:24:42.849]  This David X guy is probably one of these people running a PSYOP on you, man.
[00:24:42.929 --> 00:24:48.213]  That's all this Satanism is, is a bunch of psychiatry, psychology, witch doctor phlegm phlegm.
[00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:54.858]  Witch doctors 5,000 years ago would give you an hallucinogen, you'd flip out, they'd tell you you're now my slave.
[00:24:54.878 --> 00:25:01.783]  It's just like, you know, in voodoo where they give people the zombie drug that makes them think they died.
[00:25:02.144 --> 00:25:03.885]  It's all just mind control crap.
[00:25:04.045 --> 00:25:05.045]  Well, let me tell you something.
[00:25:05.105 --> 00:25:08.086]  I actually had someone get inside my dreams.
[00:25:08.266 --> 00:25:13.487]  I actually had someone that was able to place themselves in my dreams, and they were influencing my dreams.
[00:25:14.687 --> 00:25:16.327]  I did some things to prevent that.
[00:25:16.567 --> 00:25:19.048]  I put a dampening field in my bedroom.
[00:25:20.748 --> 00:25:23.608]  Mancow, you're something else today, aren't you?
[00:25:24.128 --> 00:25:27.569]  Listen, I know about these parties, but I want to talk about who you saw at the party.
[00:25:28.109 --> 00:25:28.709]  I can't.
[00:25:28.809 --> 00:25:29.309]  I won't do it.
[00:25:29.689 --> 00:25:32.590]  This is Mancow, Republican stalwart, supporter of George W. Bush.
[00:25:34.282 --> 00:25:36.122]  We'll be right back in one minute with Mary Kay.
[00:25:36.162 --> 00:25:37.383]  I'll stay with us.

[00:25:48.004 --> 00:25:53.185]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:25:53.305 --> 00:25:57.666]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:25:57.826 --> 00:25:59.686]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:26:00.107 --> 00:26:01.447]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:26:01.727 --> 00:26:02.767]  There is a solution.

[00:26:53.558 --> 00:26:56.320]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:02.867 --> 00:27:07.030]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:27:07.691 --> 00:27:08.511]  You want answers?
[00:27:09.272 --> 00:27:10.213]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:10.833 --> 00:27:14.536]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:15.037 --> 00:27:19.080]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:20.643 --> 00:27:23.385]  Mancow, I know these parties go on.
[00:27:23.425 --> 00:27:26.907]  I've been told by people in Hollywood... I went to one!
[00:27:27.167 --> 00:27:31.210]  No, no, no, but I know it's come out in the news, but then you start getting off into this other craziness.
[00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:36.413]  You're telling me a guy during the break would... Well, I mean, tell the story briefly.
[00:27:36.733 --> 00:27:38.293]  Well, look, I went to this party.
[00:27:38.493 --> 00:27:46.735]  It was a big deal in San Diego at Comic-Con, and it was all kinds of evil stuff and mockery of nuns and sexual acts with the Pope, and it was really evil stuff.
[00:27:46.755 --> 00:27:47.615]  There was bloodletting.
[00:27:47.655 --> 00:27:49.215]  There was sex going on, drugs.
[00:27:49.735 --> 00:27:56.717]  And as I was leaving, this guy who's called my show over the years said he saw me there and that there was this... He called himself David X. I don't know his real name.
[00:27:56.757 --> 00:27:57.697]  I don't know if he's legit.
[00:27:57.797 --> 00:28:03.278]  I can't... And he said that he saw a woman there, that he was the shifter, and he was looking at this all for the government.
[00:28:03.398 --> 00:28:03.758]  I don't know.
[00:28:04.458 --> 00:28:05.238]  Okay?
[00:28:05.338 --> 00:28:11.261]  And then that led into my next point was, uh... Look, remote viewing.
[00:28:11.761 --> 00:28:15.722]  I have done... Alex is so involved.
[00:28:16.002 --> 00:28:21.685]  Timothy Leary set me up with a guy who was involved with the S-Movement, another guy named Bob Hamilton out of Carmel, California.
[00:28:22.325 --> 00:28:24.186]  And I started to do these exercises.
[00:28:24.206 --> 00:28:25.166]  They said it would take years.
[00:28:25.206 --> 00:28:27.947]  In a couple of days I was able to make my mind leave my body.
[00:28:28.187 --> 00:28:28.767]  Have you ever done it?
[00:28:29.888 --> 00:28:30.508]  No comment.
[00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:32.390]  No, no, no, no.
[00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:33.670]  And I was completely sober.
[00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:35.191]  I hadn't smoked any weed or anything.
[00:28:35.551 --> 00:28:40.131]  And I was able to put my mind in another room.
[00:28:40.672 --> 00:28:50.993]  So if you believe in remote viewing, I had a caller, a listener to the show, who was telling me what I was reading before I went to sleep, what I was doing before I went to sleep, what magazines were on my night table, and what I was dreaming.
[00:28:51.533 --> 00:28:52.834]  And this began to terrify me.
[00:28:52.854 --> 00:28:58.515]  When I say a dampening field, I went to sharper image, and I got a white noise machine, and I crank it up every night.
[00:28:58.835 --> 00:29:00.975]  And this guy has not been able to enter my dreams.
[00:29:01.664 --> 00:29:02.865]  Look, it's true what I'm telling you.
[00:29:02.885 --> 00:29:10.087]  There was a listener to my radio show, and he would talk to me in my dreams and then call me and say, hey, last night we talked about this.
[00:29:10.888 --> 00:29:12.048]  And it was evil.
[00:29:12.608 --> 00:29:14.149]  It scared me like you can't believe.
[00:29:14.249 --> 00:29:15.589]  I had to take drugs to go to sleep.
[00:29:15.649 --> 00:29:16.790]  I had to get a prescription of Ambien.
[00:29:17.902 --> 00:29:20.324]  Uh, and, in fact, I'm still trying to get off that.
[00:29:20.624 --> 00:29:31.335]  I, like Rush with Oxy, I started to develop a real habit here, but I just, I was so terrified to go to sleep because of this remote viewer, this listener to my program who'd invade my dreams.
[00:29:31.916 --> 00:29:34.418]  And, uh, it's true, and you can laugh at me and say it's not true.
[00:29:34.438 --> 00:29:35.039]  I'm telling you, sir.
[00:29:35.459 --> 00:29:38.982]  No, no, I just, you know, you're usually serious, you screw around some.
[00:29:39.002 --> 00:29:41.924]  I know about the parties, and that's even come out in the news.
[00:29:41.944 --> 00:29:47.529]  I mean, remember, like, in, like, 1998, it came out with the mayor and they were crapping on stage?
[00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:52.373]  Oh, well, how about Mayor Willie Brown and, you know, the, uh... 49er party?
[00:29:52.433 --> 00:29:57.737]  Yeah, I mean... No, no, I mean, that was, I mean, you were on the air, and you actually lived in San Francisco then, didn't you?
[00:29:57.757 --> 00:29:59.759]  Yeah, and look, Willie Brown is a fun guy.
[00:29:59.819 --> 00:30:03.162]  He'd be a fun guy to go to a party with, and these people were doing
[00:30:03.662 --> 00:30:05.543]  Basically, you can read about it.
[00:30:05.583 --> 00:30:09.046]  It's in a book called the Bible, and it was the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:30:09.086 --> 00:30:11.768]  That's what it was like there in San Francisco.
[00:30:11.808 --> 00:30:14.249]  No, that was in the San Francisco Chronicles, I believe.
[00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:16.150]  Absolutely true!
[00:30:16.551 --> 00:30:19.773]  And I had the number one show in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose.
[00:30:20.053 --> 00:30:27.218]  And I was also... Alex, let me quickly... I hosted the premiere of 8mm with Nicolas Cage.
[00:30:27.658 --> 00:30:33.002]  I left the movie and all my friends and family went, that's the most stupid, ridiculous, unrealistic movie.
[00:30:33.982 --> 00:30:36.585]  I'm telling you, I saw things like that in San Francisco.
[00:30:36.605 --> 00:30:38.446]  That movie was very, very accurate.
[00:30:38.787 --> 00:30:44.652]  And Willie Brown was going to these parties, and I'm telling you, it was... It was kooky, my friend.
[00:30:46.173 --> 00:30:48.375]  I'm not saying there were stunt films being made with Willie Brown.
[00:30:48.395 --> 00:30:52.879]  I want to make that clear, but... Hey, why don't you ask Nick Cage about the stingray tattoo on his ankle?
[00:30:53.239 --> 00:30:53.980]  Let me ask you this.
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.141]  Did you see the movie Knowing?
[00:30:57.077 --> 00:30:58.538]  Oh, brother, I highly recommend it.
[00:30:58.598 --> 00:31:00.159]  Everybody, my wife told me to see it.
[00:31:00.199 --> 00:31:01.440]  Charlie Sheen told me to see it.
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:02.901]  Oh, well, Charlie Sheen's right.
[00:31:02.981 --> 00:31:06.183]  Knowing is a fantastic movie, and they didn't advertise it right.
[00:31:06.623 --> 00:31:08.104]  They didn't sell what it really was.
[00:31:08.725 --> 00:31:09.905]  It's a good one, Alex.
[00:31:09.925 --> 00:31:10.386]  You'll like it.
[00:31:10.606 --> 00:31:10.966]  No, I know.
[00:31:11.006 --> 00:31:11.907]  It's a Rapture film.
[00:31:12.647 --> 00:31:14.989]  Well, or is it?
[00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:17.550]  Or is it?
[00:31:19.932 --> 00:31:20.232]  I wonder.
[00:31:22.301 --> 00:31:23.762]  Mankow, you are something else.
[00:31:24.122 --> 00:31:26.823]  Mankow.com, it's always wild to have you on.
[00:31:26.843 --> 00:31:28.983]  We appreciate you joining us.
[00:31:29.043 --> 00:31:30.464]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:31:30.924 --> 00:31:33.745]  Can I say one final thing?
[00:31:34.005 --> 00:31:34.245]  Yes.
[00:31:34.385 --> 00:31:36.026]  Do you mind?
[00:31:36.106 --> 00:31:38.327]  We were brought up in schools, never again, never again.
[00:31:38.347 --> 00:31:40.727]  Well, never again is happening again.
[00:31:40.747 --> 00:31:44.048]  We better wake up to what this president really is and speak up for Israel.
[00:31:46.189 --> 00:31:48.130]  Alright, Mankow, thank you for coming on the show.
[00:31:49.636 --> 00:31:51.197]  There he goes, Mancow Muller.
[00:31:51.858 --> 00:31:56.341]  We'll come back and talk to Pastor Anderson, who's making national news.
[00:31:56.421 --> 00:31:56.941]  Stay with us.
[00:31:58.302 --> 00:32:03.286]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:32:03.506 --> 00:32:07.309]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:07.529 --> 00:32:13.153]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:13.434 --> 00:32:13.914]  It's true.
[00:32:14.094 --> 00:32:18.297]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:18.517 --> 00:32:19.018]  Number three,
[00:32:19.418 --> 00:32:24.861]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:32:25.702 --> 00:32:28.384]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:32:28.604 --> 00:32:32.826]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:33.126 --> 00:32:36.769]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:32:36.969 --> 00:32:42.472]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long-time sponsor of ours.

[00:32:58.544 --> 00:33:01.147]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:33:01.547 --> 00:33:06.512]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:33:06.873 --> 00:33:08.615]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:33:08.935 --> 00:33:13.740]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:14.901]  How much do you want?
[00:33:15.121 --> 00:33:15.862]  When do you want it?
[00:33:16.243 --> 00:33:17.844]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:33:18.125 --> 00:33:18.945]  When will you need it?
[00:33:19.206 --> 00:33:21.208]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:33:21.408 --> 00:33:22.489]  Will there be any food?
[00:33:22.709 --> 00:33:24.050]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:29.313]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:33:29.513 --> 00:33:32.695]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:33:33.095 --> 00:33:36.557]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:33:36.917 --> 00:33:37.898]  How much will you need?
[00:33:38.138 --> 00:33:38.758]  We don't know.
[00:33:39.038 --> 00:33:39.959]  How much do you want?
[00:33:40.159 --> 00:33:40.879]  All you can get.
[00:33:41.079 --> 00:33:41.920]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.941]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:33:45.221 --> 00:33:46.982]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:33:47.002 --> 00:33:47.923]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:34:03.177 --> 00:34:05.818]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[00:34:06.239 --> 00:34:08.520]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.202]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutraversal Foods.
[00:34:12.642 --> 00:34:19.026]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[00:34:19.346 --> 00:34:22.888]  Dig into our chili with cornmeal dumplings and you'll feel like a wealthy Texan.
[00:34:23.228 --> 00:34:27.170]  Or sip a cup of warm potato cheddar soup and be soothed on a cold rainy day.
[00:34:28.319 --> 00:34:28.719]  We're good to go.
[00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:29.259]  We're good to go.
[00:34:29.319 --> 00:34:30.379]  We're good to go.
[00:34:30.439 --> 00:34:31.260]  We're good to go.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:31.940]  We're good to go.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.640]  We're good to go.
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:33.400]  We're good to go.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.520]  We're good to go.
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.001]  We're good to go.
[00:34:36.021 --> 00:34:36.441]  We're good to go.
[00:34:36.461 --> 00:34:37.481]  We're good to go.
[00:34:37.521 --> 00:34:38.541]  We're good to go.
[00:34:38.561 --> 00:34:39.302]  We're good to go.
[00:34:39.322 --> 00:34:39.922]  We're good to go.
[00:34:39.942 --> 00:34:40.582]  We're good to go.
[00:34:40.602 --> 00:34:41.162]  We're good to go.
[00:34:41.202 --> 00:34:41.702]  We're good to go.
[00:34:41.722 --> 00:34:42.562]  We're good to go.
[00:34:42.582 --> 00:34:43.363]  We're good to go.
[00:34:43.383 --> 00:34:43.943]  We're good to go.
[00:34:43.963 --> 00:34:44.823]  We're good to go.
[00:34:44.843 --> 00:34:45.463]  We're good to go.
[00:34:45.483 --> 00:34:45.943]  We're good to go.
[00:34:46.003 --> 00:34:46.743]  We're good to go.
[00:34:47.223 --> 00:34:48.164]  We're good to go.
[00:34:48.184 --> 00:34:48.924]  We're good to go.
[00:34:49.144 --> 00:34:49.684]  We're good to go.
[00:34:49.764 --> 00:34:50.904]  We're good to go.
[00:34:50.924 --> 00:34:51.664]  We're good to go.
[00:34:51.865 --> 00:34:52.225]  We're good to go.
[00:34:52.265 --> 00:34:52.925]  We're good to go.
[00:34:52.945 --> 00:34:53.585]  We're good to go.
[00:34:53.625 --> 00:34:54.165]  We're good to go.
[00:34:54.205 --> 00:34:55.265]  We're good to go.
[00:34:55.285 --> 00:34:56.046]  We're good to go.
[00:34:56.266 --> 00:34:56.966]  We're good to go.
[00:34:56.986 --> 00:34:57.866]  We're good to go.
[00:34:57.906 --> 00:34:58.006]  We're
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:07.463]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:35:08.123 --> 00:35:08.944]  You want answers?
[00:35:09.724 --> 00:35:10.745]  Well, so does he.
[00:35:11.265 --> 00:35:14.888]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:15.448 --> 00:35:19.551]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:35:26.138 --> 00:35:31.241]  Alright, we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv, simulcasting with the syndicated radio Transmission.
[00:35:31.561 --> 00:35:46.148]  This is first and foremost a radio show, but we bring it into the living color dimension of television, so we can document, show you video, show you articles, government documents, have guests in studio, add that added dimension of the visual.
[00:35:47.669 --> 00:35:52.211]  For the rest of the hour, we are joined by Pastor Steve Anderson, who I really admire.
[00:35:52.592 --> 00:35:54.273]  FaithfulWordBaptist.tv.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.001]  FaithfulWordBaptist.org.
[00:35:59.221 --> 00:36:01.142]  He's the fella that got beat up.
[00:36:02.442 --> 00:36:05.363]  They have checkpoints all over the country, over 100 miles in now.
[00:36:05.583 --> 00:36:09.904]  From Vermont to Washington State, Texas, Arizona.
[00:36:10.224 --> 00:36:11.985]  And the illegal aliens, they just wave them through it.
[00:36:12.625 --> 00:36:24.028]  In fact, it's come out in San Francisco Chronicle of all places, that they just take the illegal aliens and when Homeland Security does do a staged raid a couple times a year,
[00:36:25.077 --> 00:36:28.578]  You know, the tens of millions will arrest usually about a thousand at some meat packing plant.
[00:36:30.818 --> 00:36:31.418]  That's the M.O.
[00:36:31.458 --> 00:36:32.619]  in the last five years we've seen.
[00:36:32.899 --> 00:36:34.539]  They take them and then give them a government job.
[00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:35.979]  They actually take them to get a green card.
[00:36:35.999 --> 00:36:37.500]  I mean, that's been in the news.
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:43.601]  So Mr. Anderson, Pastor Anderson, started saying, look, you know, you don't get to search my car.
[00:36:43.721 --> 00:36:43.941]  No.
[00:36:44.501 --> 00:36:46.502]  You gotta have a warrant.
[00:36:46.582 --> 00:36:47.722]  There's no probable cause here.
[00:36:47.742 --> 00:36:52.043]  And so they took him out and beat the living daylights out of him, split his head open, really tore him up bad.
[00:36:53.615 --> 00:36:56.637]  Now, since then, I've watched a few of his sermons.
[00:36:56.677 --> 00:37:00.040]  He's a listener of the show, and I agree with what I saw.
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:06.985]  I understand what he said biblically, and I understand God's judgment.
[00:37:07.946 --> 00:37:09.407]  And I'm even upset on air.
[00:37:09.487 --> 00:37:16.072]  I hope that CPS kidnappers and government child molesters, when they're always getting caught, I hope God will deal with them.
[00:37:16.833 --> 00:37:20.735]  Because at a very innate, instinctive, and spiritual level,
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:30.663]  My instincts are, when somebody threatens me or somebody says they want to hurt me or my family, I innately want to crush them.
[00:37:31.043 --> 00:37:33.224]  It's not some vengeful thing, it's just an instinct.
[00:37:34.884 --> 00:37:36.545]  And it's a sense of justice, spiritually.
[00:37:37.825 --> 00:37:43.887]  But, the way the media can edit things together, like I'm always calling for non-violence, unless it's to defend yourself.
[00:37:43.907 --> 00:37:50.849]  But psychology today says that, lies and says the FBI and Secret Service are after me for threatening the President.
[00:37:52.248 --> 00:37:53.769]  And that I'm calling for violence.
[00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:56.932]  And I'm calling for my followers to be violent.
[00:37:57.892 --> 00:38:00.254]  I mean, they are trying to set me up.
[00:38:01.916 --> 00:38:03.357]  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's done this.
[00:38:04.523 --> 00:38:11.405]  And I understand at an innate, wholesome level, all this corruption and evils around you, you want to physically confront it.
[00:38:12.025 --> 00:38:13.386]  Or you want to ask God to confront it.
[00:38:13.646 --> 00:38:18.507]  I'm just saying, and I want to talk to Pastor Anderson in a moment, we need to be aware of how this is being manipulated.
[00:38:18.867 --> 00:38:23.709]  One of the worst shows on CNN, this guy's always putting out propaganda, this guy's attacked me several times.
[00:38:25.052 --> 00:38:27.777]  Uh, distorts what he said, distorted what Chris said.
[00:38:27.797 --> 00:38:30.663]  Did you notice these are like two, three second clips out of context.
[00:38:30.963 --> 00:38:33.708]  So I wanted to have Pastor Anderson up so he can respond to this.
[00:38:33.728 --> 00:38:34.410]  So here is...
[00:38:35.407 --> 00:38:39.709]  We'll play part of this CNN clip so he can respond and analyze it right now.
[00:38:39.749 --> 00:38:40.190]  Here it is.
[00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:47.894]  So many of you have been contacting me about the ugly and hateful tone that's being used against the President of the United States.
[00:38:48.054 --> 00:38:54.757]  What appear to be a growing number of events around the country may be now eclipsed by what I'm about to share with you.
[00:38:54.878 --> 00:39:04.523]  This is a pastor, albeit of a small church in Tempe, Arizona, who said this over the weekend about the death of Senator Ted Kennedy and about the President of the United States.
[00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:07.411]  I want him to be a martyr.
[00:39:07.752 --> 00:39:08.773]  We don't need another holiday.
[00:39:09.214 --> 00:39:11.458]  I'd like to see him die like Ted Kennedy of brain cancer.
[00:39:13.223 --> 00:39:27.548]  On its own, that story could be seen by some as the ranting of a madman, but when connected to the increase of threats against the president, as detailed to us by several sources, it becomes a story of some national significance.
[00:39:28.088 --> 00:39:30.969]  And here's another reason that story becomes more important.
[00:39:31.569 --> 00:39:37.111]  You know who was sitting in the church when Pastor Steven Anderson suggested that the president should die?
[00:39:37.671 --> 00:39:40.652]  Let me show you, because it also goes back to our previous reporting.
[00:39:41.052 --> 00:39:41.452]  This man.
[00:39:41.992 --> 00:39:45.454]  You're going to tell me that I'm supposed to pray for the socialist devil
[00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:10.327]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:40:33.976 --> 00:40:42.161]  Now, it's true, Obama took the restrictions off, forced abortion money for China and India and infanticide and abortion money for Africa.
[00:40:43.422 --> 00:40:49.305]  But see, it's okay for the eugenicists to write their textbooks about how they want to sterilize us and abort us and drug our water.
[00:40:50.146 --> 00:40:55.049]  Assaulting us that way because they do it real sweet and loving with a liberal voice, that's okay.
[00:40:55.589 --> 00:41:01.293]  But if you say you want God to punish people that are killing millions of babies, you're bad.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.562]  Now, the establishment believes in all this.
[00:41:04.602 --> 00:41:05.743]  That's why they're upset by it.
[00:41:06.224 --> 00:41:09.167]  And they also want to demonize everybody else who's criticizing Obama.
[00:41:09.187 --> 00:41:10.348]  They want to radicalize this.
[00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:14.872]  But I do have to say, Pastor Anderson, we're going to play the rest of the clip.
[00:41:14.892 --> 00:41:18.096]  They've got the Secret Service on there, talking about do you need to be arrested.
[00:41:18.776 --> 00:41:20.098]  Clearly, it's your right.
[00:41:21.557 --> 00:41:26.903]  Uh, to, you know, say that you, you know, when they ask you, do you want harm to the President, you go, no, I'd like God to deal with him.
[00:41:27.283 --> 00:41:35.451]  They beg the question, and then they distorted it, and the way it's cut so short, it's clear they didn't want fully what you and Chris to be said said.
[00:41:35.531 --> 00:41:40.677]  So, before I even criticize you, I'm saying the way they present it, it doesn't come off well.
[00:41:41.538 --> 00:41:43.319]  Explain to me what you fully said.
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.561]  Thanks for joining us, Pastor.
[00:41:46.121 --> 00:41:46.882]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:41:46.902 --> 00:41:47.522]  I appreciate it.
[00:41:48.003 --> 00:41:49.044]  We appreciate you.
[00:41:49.104 --> 00:41:52.166]  Are you referring to the Ted Kennedy comment or the sermon?
[00:41:53.367 --> 00:41:56.270]  Well, I mean, both of it, because they're clearly taking little bitty clips.
[00:41:57.090 --> 00:42:01.014]  What did you really say in the totality, in full?
[00:42:02.155 --> 00:42:04.457]  Well, basically, here's what the whole sermon was about.
[00:42:04.497 --> 00:42:05.978]  Here's what all my statements were about.
[00:42:06.438 --> 00:42:07.800]  God is a God of justice.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:12.724]  God is a God of whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
[00:42:13.479 --> 00:42:32.863]  And, you know, Obama and other presidents before him have been guilty of murder, have been guilty of using my tax dollars to fund abortions in America and abroad, infanticide, forced sterilizations, murder, all these horrible things, and I said that he should reap what he sow.
[00:42:32.883 --> 00:42:36.403]  You know, I don't understand why this is even such a big news story.
[00:42:37.083 --> 00:42:40.124]  You know, you can pick up the Bible in any Dollar Tree across America,
[00:42:41.264 --> 00:42:49.791]  And yet, people are shocked that somebody's actually preaching what the Bible says, which is that murderers should be tried and executed, which is what the Bible teaches.
[00:42:49.851 --> 00:42:52.193]  And, you know, I use the example of Charles Manson.
[00:42:52.674 --> 00:42:59.880]  Charles Manson never physically murdered anyone, yet he was given a death sentence in the state of California for being a part of murder.
[00:43:00.632 --> 00:43:13.123]  For, you know, basically inciting people to murder, and that's exactly what I would put Obama in that category by taking my tax dollars, making these executive orders that slaughter, you know, unborn and newborn babies.
[00:43:13.584 --> 00:43:18.308]  He's a murderer, and therefore he should be punished as such, and I made it clear in the sermon.
[00:43:18.348 --> 00:43:20.871]  This is, of course, what they'll never play on the TV.
[00:43:21.571 --> 00:43:27.458]  All the different times in the sermon I explained that, you know, our battle as Christians is not against flesh and blood.
[00:43:27.478 --> 00:43:28.980]  We're not going to take up arms.
[00:43:29.441 --> 00:43:31.083]  We're going to let God take care of it.
[00:43:31.523 --> 00:43:33.185]  Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord.
[00:43:33.946 --> 00:43:37.851]  And in reality, prayer is the exact opposite of taking things into your own hands.
[00:43:38.562 --> 00:43:43.963]  It's praying that God will step in and carry out justice on these evil people who are destroying our country.
[00:43:44.003 --> 00:43:47.544]  It's not us going out and threatening to kill them.
[00:43:47.865 --> 00:43:50.345]  That Rick Sanchez has been lying.
[00:43:50.785 --> 00:43:52.606]  Let me expose to you one of his biggest lies.
[00:43:53.266 --> 00:43:57.307]  The first time he ran the story, he said, we've been trying to get him on the show.
[00:43:57.387 --> 00:43:59.148]  We're trying to reach out to Pastor Anderson.
[00:43:59.568 --> 00:44:03.949]  When in reality, I had agreed to do a live interview on the show and they canceled me.
[00:44:04.509 --> 00:44:07.850]  And then they go on TV saying that I'm not going on there.
[00:44:09.791 --> 00:44:14.894]  That's happened to me probably more than 20 times with CNN especially.
[00:44:15.434 --> 00:44:27.761]  They will say, oh we had Mr. Jones but now he's refused to be here with us and I've been in the car driving to the satellite uplink and they say they don't want you now and take you back just so they can jerk you around.
[00:44:27.801 --> 00:44:28.721]  They're just bastards.
[00:44:30.563 --> 00:44:31.503]  That's exactly right.
[00:44:32.283 --> 00:44:36.446]  And so it's amazing to me that people are so shocked
[00:44:37.159 --> 00:44:44.344]  When the Bible, the Bible's been around for a long time, and you know, praying for someone to die is not something that I made up, okay?
[00:44:44.364 --> 00:44:59.935]  There are about 18 psalms in the book of Psalms, which contains 150 psalms, which contain curses on God's enemies, and praying that they'll die, praying that they'll go down quick into hell, I mean, Psalm 55- Why don't you go over a few of those today?
[00:44:59.955 --> 00:45:02.257]  Pastor, why don't we read a few of those scriptures together?
[00:45:03.257 --> 00:45:03.857]  Okay, sure.
[00:45:04.257 --> 00:45:23.484]  Because the thing is, people want to make this about me personally, and they want to make it an attack on me personally, and I'd like to see some other pastors stand up and get on the firing line with me, instead of, you know, hiding their head in the sand and running away scared, you know, and leaving me to take all the heat alone for the Bible, which has been around for thousands of years.
[00:45:23.944 --> 00:45:25.705]  Let me read a scripture for you from Psalm 5515.
[00:45:27.677 --> 00:45:36.600]  The Bible says, Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell, for wickedness is in their dwellings and among them.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.841]  As for me, I will call upon God, and the Lord shall save me.
[00:45:40.482 --> 00:45:41.422]  Now, I didn't write that.
[00:45:41.802 --> 00:45:47.324]  That's David speaking, and he's praying that God will send these wicked people to hell.
[00:45:48.084 --> 00:45:50.965]  And a lot of people will try to say, well, that's just David talking.
[00:45:51.005 --> 00:45:51.926]  That's man's word.
[00:45:52.771 --> 00:45:53.431]  No, my friend.
[00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:55.152]  The Bible is written by God.
[00:45:55.292 --> 00:45:56.292]  I'm a Baptist preacher.
[00:45:56.352 --> 00:45:57.913]  I believe the Bible is God's Word.
[00:45:58.533 --> 00:46:06.176]  And in Acts Chapter 4, when they quoted the Book of Psalms, they said, Well, spake the Lord God by the mouth of David the prophet.
[00:46:06.756 --> 00:46:08.156]  But David was a prophet of God.
[00:46:08.176 --> 00:46:11.437]  He was speaking God's Word, not just his own words out of his own heart.
[00:46:11.998 --> 00:46:18.800]  And that's one example in Psalm 55, 15, and 16, where he's praying that they'll die and go to hell.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:19.680]  And here's the thing.
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:21.521]  I don't have the power to send anyone to hell.
[00:46:22.259 --> 00:46:27.309]  I'm just praying for him to die and whether I want him to go to heaven or he's going to hell anyway.
[00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:28.912]  That's not even my decision.
[00:46:29.773 --> 00:46:34.242]  You know, I'm just praying that he dies so that other human lives could be saved for the greater good.
[00:46:36.578 --> 00:46:47.289]  Well, let's go over some more of those, so CNN can have a problem with the Bible, and actually in Canada, in England, in Europe, they are trying to ban hundreds and hundreds of passages similar to the one you just read.
[00:46:47.889 --> 00:46:49.931]  We know why they want the hate crime legislation.
[00:46:50.892 --> 00:46:54.336]  But this is the Bible, and I know a lot of phony Christians have a big problem with it.
[00:46:54.796 --> 00:46:56.478]  That's why they love the New World Order.
[00:46:58.464 --> 00:47:01.508]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[00:47:01.869 --> 00:47:06.114]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[00:47:06.315 --> 00:47:08.497]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[00:47:08.838 --> 00:47:13.724]  According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[00:47:15.086 --> 00:47:22.370]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.
[00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:24.691]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.

[00:47:58.795 --> 00:48:00.676]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:48:00.897 --> 00:48:02.077]  September 3rd, 2009.
[00:48:02.538 --> 00:48:03.518]  Gold opened this morning at $9.8620.
[00:48:03.879 --> 00:48:09.242]  A one ounce gold coin to be purchased for $1014.08, $507.04 for a half ounce or $253.52 for the quarter ounce.
[00:48:09.282 --> 00:48:09.663]  That's $1014.08, $507.04 or $253.52.
[00:48:18.422 --> 00:48:31.932]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[00:48:32.032 --> 00:48:33.033]  Is this capitalism?
[00:48:33.293 --> 00:48:40.659]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:48:40.859 --> 00:48:41.840]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:46.123]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[00:48:46.303 --> 00:48:47.384]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[00:48:47.404 --> 00:48:48.405]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:48.605]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:48:48.665 --> 00:48:49.065]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:48:49.165 --> 00:48:52.368]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:49:05.271 --> 00:49:10.633]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:49:11.153 --> 00:49:17.355]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:49:17.635 --> 00:49:19.456]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:49:19.616 --> 00:49:21.996]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:49:22.076 --> 00:49:32.960]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:49:35.268 --> 00:49:36.529]  It's not about left or right.
[00:49:36.929 --> 00:49:38.349]  It's about a one world government.
[00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:45.132]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:49:45.692 --> 00:49:53.475]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:49:53.955 --> 00:49:55.095]  The Obama Deception.
[00:49:55.535 --> 00:49:56.696]  The people strike back.
[00:49:58.883 --> 00:50:07.549]  Did you know that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, and your congressional candidate, Robert Beatles, wrote a 72-page book on how to become wealthy?
[00:50:07.869 --> 00:50:10.331]  It doesn't matter if you are poor or wealthy.
[00:50:10.511 --> 00:50:11.892]  This book is for you.
[00:50:12.252 --> 00:50:17.335]  The book tells you how to create and protect your wealth, and it's called, Here's What You Do.
[00:50:17.655 --> 00:50:21.398]  You can buy it for only $6 at here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:50:21.618 --> 00:50:23.559]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:50:23.879 --> 00:50:26.081]  Again, here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:50:26.421 --> 00:50:27.102]  Buy it today.
[00:50:27.922 --> 00:50:29.003]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:50:29.163 --> 00:50:33.546]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:50:33.706 --> 00:50:39.430]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:42.952]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:50:43.172 --> 00:50:45.794]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:50:45.894 --> 00:50:50.817]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:50:50.957 --> 00:50:51.178]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:50:51.198 --> 00:50:52.599]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:51:05.684 --> 00:51:10.645]  We're going to play a little bit more of this CNN clip coming up in the next segment with Pastor Anderson.
[00:51:14.505 --> 00:51:22.927]  But you've got the military under Bush's lies, kills over a million Iraqis, admitted 18 years of sanctions.
[00:51:24.045 --> 00:51:25.546]  Nobody wrings their hands about that.
[00:51:26.527 --> 00:51:33.873]  Obama poses as this great guy who loves the African people and he's expanding the abortion and forced abortion against them.
[00:51:34.493 --> 00:51:35.214]  That's on record.
[00:51:35.935 --> 00:51:39.357]  And he also called for killing babies after they're born.
[00:51:40.518 --> 00:51:43.381]  If they're accidentally born in partial birth abortion when they're nine months old.
[00:51:43.821 --> 00:51:44.922]  And he's on record.
[00:51:44.942 --> 00:51:47.304]  He really called for that when he was a U.S.
[00:51:47.344 --> 00:51:48.405]  and state senator as well.
[00:51:49.437 --> 00:51:51.219]  But why did anybody care about these babies?
[00:51:51.299 --> 00:51:54.101]  I mean, I know Obama's a complete puppet.
[00:51:54.421 --> 00:51:55.823]  He's not the real King Herod.
[00:51:56.263 --> 00:51:57.844]  He's not the real King of the Philistines.
[00:51:58.585 --> 00:52:06.372]  I understand in this more sophisticated game that he's just a puppet and they get sympathy off this, but taking a pastor out of context,
[00:52:08.348 --> 00:52:11.390]  Who's reading, I guess, what do you call those prayers?
[00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:12.171]  Imperpetory?
[00:52:12.211 --> 00:52:13.932]  Or what's the term for prayers?
[00:52:13.952 --> 00:52:21.717]  A lot of people use the term imprecatory, which comes from the word imprecation, which is to curse someone.
[00:52:22.958 --> 00:52:26.361]  Okay, so what are some of the other things in the Bible that they'd like to burn?
[00:52:28.049 --> 00:52:35.613]  Well, you know, first of all, the part that I actually preached in the sermon that they're all outraged about was actually Psalm 58.
[00:52:36.554 --> 00:52:38.275]  And I can read a part of that if you want.
[00:52:38.295 --> 00:52:40.236]  This is where my sermon basically came from.
[00:52:40.456 --> 00:52:41.117]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:52:41.217 --> 00:52:43.818]  It says, this is Psalm 58, verse 6.
[00:52:44.178 --> 00:52:46.380]  Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth.
[00:52:47.273 --> 00:52:49.834]  Break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Lord.
[00:52:50.314 --> 00:52:53.216]  Let them melt away as waters which run continually.
[00:52:53.636 --> 00:52:56.837]  When he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.
[00:52:57.518 --> 00:53:05.161]  As a snail which melted, let every one of them pass away, like the untimely birth of a woman that they may not see the sun.
[00:53:06.164 --> 00:53:10.786]  And then verse 10 it says, "...the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance.
[00:53:11.206 --> 00:53:17.849]  He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked, so that a man shall say, Verily, there is a reward for the righteous.
[00:53:18.029 --> 00:53:20.350]  Verily, he is a God that judges in the earth."
[00:53:21.411 --> 00:53:28.894]  Now, you know, I didn't write that, and yet I'm taking heat this week, last week, the week before, for those words.
[00:53:29.234 --> 00:53:34.697]  For preaching those words and applying them to the person whom they most definitely apply to.
[00:53:36.969 --> 00:53:40.791]  But, Pastor, I understand you're preaching the Bible here.
[00:53:40.831 --> 00:53:44.113]  You have a right to do it, and I understand why you're saying what you're saying and what you're doing.
[00:53:44.153 --> 00:53:46.914]  I'm not, you know, I've defended you when they beat you up for no reason.
[00:53:47.634 --> 00:53:50.736]  The TV host acts like you're some type of criminal that deserves it.
[00:53:51.096 --> 00:53:53.557]  He then has people on basically calling for your arrest.
[00:53:53.938 --> 00:53:54.798]  We're going to cover that.
[00:53:55.578 --> 00:54:02.702]  But, just politically, and I understand you and others standing up to him is starting to intimidate the establishment.
[00:54:02.942 --> 00:54:06.144]  They realize there's millions of Americans now who are just ready for a fight.
[00:54:07.903 --> 00:54:09.864]  And who are sick of mincing words.
[00:54:10.704 --> 00:54:12.965]  And so maybe it's the right course you're taking.
[00:54:13.205 --> 00:54:17.647]  Just instinctively and politically, Obama is a front man and a puppet.
[00:54:17.667 --> 00:54:21.088]  The establishment want him as a shield to take the arrows.
[00:54:21.849 --> 00:54:30.232]  And certainly you can't mince your words knowing that they're going to edit them and take them out of context as they did.
[00:54:30.872 --> 00:54:33.013]  But I just think that
[00:54:33.971 --> 00:54:35.272]  I definitely see your point, but here's the thing.
[00:54:35.292 --> 00:54:35.813]  I'm not a politician.
[00:54:54.685 --> 00:55:02.828]  So, I don't care what happens politically, because the way that I run my life, and the way that I pastor my church, and the way that I preach, has always been the same.
[00:55:03.288 --> 00:55:08.070]  And it's preach the Word of God, preach the truth, and let the chips fall where they may.
[00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:11.071]  That's what any man of God, any preacher, should be doing.
[00:55:11.431 --> 00:55:13.872]  And not weighing, oh, well, how are people going to use this?
[00:55:14.212 --> 00:55:15.413]  Are people going to like this?
[00:55:15.453 --> 00:55:16.633]  Is my church going to grow?
[00:55:16.673 --> 00:55:17.774]  Am I going to lose people?
[00:55:18.154 --> 00:55:19.194]  To me, that doesn't matter.
[00:55:19.334 --> 00:55:23.656]  What matters to me is, did I obey God when He told me as a preacher to preach the Word?
[00:55:24.116 --> 00:55:37.164]  No, I see what you're saying, because once you start giving in, we now have gelted preachers saying, take the inoculations, go to the FEMA camps, clergy response team, tyranny's good, let the government take your children.
[00:55:37.204 --> 00:55:51.412]  I mean, they're now openly federalized, and just like Hitler or the Soviet Union, once you begin to adulterate it, you become a tool of the establishment, and now most churches, I've been to them, are absolute organs
[00:55:51.932 --> 00:55:57.014]  I mean, you feel the spirit of the world more in church now than you feel it even on the street.
[00:55:57.295 --> 00:56:03.437]  I mean, I can't go in those churches because it's just so... the spirit of the world is so strong in them.
[00:56:03.457 --> 00:56:04.558]  I mean, do you know what I'm talking about?
[00:56:05.071 --> 00:56:05.851]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[00:56:05.871 --> 00:56:07.152]  You're exactly right.
[00:56:07.572 --> 00:56:09.273]  And it's exactly what you just said.
[00:56:09.713 --> 00:56:18.377]  When you start to trim the message of the Bible, when you start to tone it down, when you start to back down and compromise, there is no end to it.
[00:56:19.277 --> 00:56:24.380]  Once you get in the habit of compromising, you're going to keep compromising and watering it down.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:28.521]  And most churches today, Alex, let's face it, are a rock and roll concert.
[00:56:28.902 --> 00:56:30.142]  They're a social club.
[00:56:30.562 --> 00:56:32.163]  They're a motivational speaker.
[00:56:32.463 --> 00:56:34.144]  They are not a real house of God.
[00:56:34.244 --> 00:56:35.845]  Well, it's a place to pick up women.
[00:56:36.606 --> 00:56:39.508]  I mean, growing up in Dallas, if you wanted to go pick up women, it was church.
[00:56:39.588 --> 00:56:41.930]  I mean, that's the party club.
[00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:43.031]  Stay there, Pastor.
[00:56:43.051 --> 00:56:43.711]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:49.036 --> 00:56:49.936]  We're on the march.
[00:56:50.437 --> 00:56:52.038]  The empire's on the run.
[00:56:52.979 --> 00:56:55.661]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:57.836 --> 00:57:03.003]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:57:03.143 --> 00:57:05.106]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:57:05.226 --> 00:57:07.509]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:57:07.669 --> 00:57:09.532]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:57:09.952 --> 00:57:11.314]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:57:11.574 --> 00:57:12.616]  There is a solution.
[00:57:12.836 --> 00:57:20.862]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:57:57.824 --> 00:58:01.805]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:02.065 --> 00:58:03.845]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:04.065 --> 00:58:12.347]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:58:12.587 --> 00:58:17.809]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:58:18.129 --> 00:58:19.749]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:58:20.009 --> 00:58:26.312]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:58:26.512 --> 00:58:37.257]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:58:37.557 --> 00:58:38.037]  That's right.
[00:58:38.317 --> 00:58:40.638]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:50.241]  Be a part of the revolution today!
[01:00:08.115 --> 01:00:13.298]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[01:00:13.578 --> 01:00:18.740]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.501]  We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'.
[01:00:21.721 --> 01:00:24.723]  There wasn't as many... The rest of the hour we have Pastor Anderson.
[01:00:24.763 --> 01:00:26.104]  We appreciate him joining us.
[01:00:26.124 --> 01:00:29.465]  Steve Quayle next hour on the flu.
[01:00:30.686 --> 01:00:31.326]  The end of the show.
[01:00:31.366 --> 01:00:33.147]  I'm going to break down psychology today.
[01:00:35.592 --> 01:00:38.514]  Was we done a more deep analysis of the hit piece on me?
[01:00:38.714 --> 01:00:39.535]  And again, it's not about it.
[01:00:39.675 --> 01:00:41.536]  It's not, we're not covering it because it's a hit piece about me.
[01:00:41.837 --> 01:00:50.563]  We're covering it because it's a case point analysis study of their deception, their lies, and they're just predatory activity.
[01:00:51.844 --> 01:00:59.270]  Before we go back to Pastor Anderson and play more of this CNN club with, you know, calls for the police to come after him for reading out of the Bible.
[01:01:00.285 --> 01:01:06.731]  Before we do that, I did just want to let you know that we have an online video bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:10.494]  And we also have a lot of apparel now that really gets the word out.

[01:02:55.792 --> 01:02:59.555]  We can still take mail there for another month, but that's just a drop box I've used for years.
[01:02:59.955 --> 01:03:01.216]  No longer used in one month.

[01:03:18.168 --> 01:03:23.250]  This is where I've chosen to get my high-quality, storable foods is eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:28.152]  You need to be self-sufficient with firearms and food and water filters.
[01:03:28.432 --> 01:03:29.873]  They have high-quality water filters.
[01:03:29.893 --> 01:03:31.433]  They have little boogie packs.
[01:03:31.453 --> 01:03:33.854]  They have three-day supplies, month supplies, year supplies.
[01:03:34.214 --> 01:03:36.395]  This is non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[01:03:36.515 --> 01:03:40.017]  Recently, in the last month, it's one of the biggest outfits out there, one of the oldest.

[01:03:49.723 --> 01:03:51.805]  Okay, going back to Pastor Anderson joining us today.
[01:04:02.052 --> 01:04:07.915]  And we'll also give you a chance to visit his website, faithfulwordbaptist.org.
[01:04:08.335 --> 01:04:11.456]  Okay, in this piece, you've undoubtedly, sir, seen the CNN piece.
[01:04:11.496 --> 01:04:12.997]  I'm going to play a clip of it in a moment.
[01:04:13.837 --> 01:04:15.778]  They're basically calling for your arrest.
[01:04:16.881 --> 01:04:20.786]  And you are saying, you know, do you want harm of the President?
[01:04:21.266 --> 01:04:24.170]  And you say, no, I want God to punish evildoers.
[01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:27.373]  And then you quote the Bible, but they don't tell people it's out of the Bible.
[01:04:27.874 --> 01:04:33.801]  Psychology Today, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and others, they say I'm calling for violence when I'm not.
[01:04:34.461 --> 01:04:36.664]  So, my only point is,
[01:04:37.705 --> 01:04:38.446]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:04:38.506 --> 01:04:46.553]  They were reporting last week that they had confirmed and were sure that I'd already visited by the Secret Service, and I hadn't, but just yesterday,
[01:05:04.346 --> 01:05:05.928]  I was visited by the Secret Service.
[01:05:06.448 --> 01:05:10.351]  I wasn't there, and I, you know, called them and said, I don't have any comments.
[01:05:11.312 --> 01:05:19.079]  You know, which is, you know, always the right course of action, is not to talk to the police, not to talk to them, you know, without an attorney, and so forth.
[01:05:19.539 --> 01:05:25.745]  But I think that CNN, with all their pushing, is probably the ones who prompted them to finally come by.
[01:05:26.606 --> 01:05:31.330]  And when the Secret Service came by, they said that I wasn't being charged with anything, that I hadn't broken any laws.
[01:05:32.557 --> 01:05:34.798]  That's what they told, you know, the people that they spoke with.
[01:05:34.838 --> 01:05:36.719]  Yeah, but CNN is hoaxing that you have.
[01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:38.940]  So do they talk to the secretary or somebody?
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.260]  Exactly.
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.521]  That's exactly right.
[01:05:42.401 --> 01:05:46.663]  So, you know, the bottom line is that, like you said, they take everything out of context.
[01:05:46.703 --> 01:05:59.609]  And it's funny because whenever they did these interviews, I also lavished a lot of criticism and rhetoric on Bush and Cheney, but they don't want to report that because they want to make it about a right versus left issue.
[01:06:00.149 --> 01:06:03.910]  Like it's the right mainstream... Yeah, they want to play us off against each other in the left-right paradigm.
[01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:11.292]  They always, just like all the Republicans that are pro-New World Order, pro-NAFTAGAT, pro-war, they're being booed off the stage at their own events.
[01:06:11.592 --> 01:06:14.733]  The media will not report on that.
[01:06:15.274 --> 01:06:17.734]  Local radio, KLBJ has, that's it.
[01:06:18.094 --> 01:06:23.176]  They will not report that all over the country that everybody's sick of the entire government.
[01:06:23.496 --> 01:06:26.517]  They've got to make it about Obama and then say it's racism.
[01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:38.824]  Exactly, and that, you know, they want to make me out that I'm some kind of a, you know, extremist Republican, that it's just against Obama, and that where was I during the Bush administration?
[01:06:38.864 --> 01:06:41.727]  You know, I've been preaching the same things for years, Alex.
[01:06:42.308 --> 01:06:45.292]  I preached this exact same sermon on Obama.
[01:06:46.397 --> 01:06:55.825]  The day, a few days after he was inaugurated, I preached the exact sermon on Obama, and it was downloaded from our website thousands of times, and yet there was no backlash on it.
[01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:57.266]  Because I'm going to tell you the truth about this.
[01:06:57.827 --> 01:06:59.909]  This is all as a result of the Border Patrol thing.
[01:07:00.449 --> 01:07:02.751]  And a lot of people don't realize that they're not putting it together.
[01:07:02.991 --> 01:07:07.916]  Ever since I released that video on YouTube of the Border Patrol beating me up and tasering me,
[01:07:08.587 --> 01:07:11.830]  There have been just one form of harassment after another.
[01:07:12.270 --> 01:07:16.794]  I'm getting pulled over all the time, and they're not even giving me a ticket, just harassed by the police.
[01:07:17.594 --> 01:07:23.539]  Other times, they're writing me bogus tickets, and then I go to court, and the ticket was never even turned in by the police officer.
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:29.464]  And, you know, now they're scouring my sermons and trying to attack me on the television.
[01:07:29.784 --> 01:07:34.188]  It's just one thing after another, and it's been ever since this whole Border Patrol incident.
[01:07:34.833 --> 01:07:37.714]  You know, I've been harassed continually in my personal life.
[01:07:38.074 --> 01:07:39.775]  It's just one thing after another.
[01:07:40.075 --> 01:07:42.736]  Well, it's like the clip from Antz.
[01:07:42.816 --> 01:07:44.776]  In fact, YouTube that clip.
[01:07:44.816 --> 01:07:52.339]  It'll be something like Antz standing up or from Antz, you know, if one ant stands up, they all stand up.
[01:07:52.739 --> 01:07:53.539]  And the grasshopper
[01:07:54.978 --> 01:07:58.260]  Lieutenant is saying to the commander, he says, there's plenty of food here.
[01:07:58.921 --> 01:08:00.322]  There's big piles of food.
[01:08:00.862 --> 01:08:04.904]  Why are we going over to the ants and making them be our slaves when we don't even need them?
[01:08:05.525 --> 01:08:08.827]  And he said, listen, those ants outnumber us 100 to 1.
[01:08:09.768 --> 01:08:12.409]  And if they ever stand up, our way of life is over.
[01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:14.571]  It's about power and control.
[01:08:15.151 --> 01:08:23.937]  And the image of you saying, no, you're not going to search me 50 miles away from the border randomly with your fat dog that gets a biscuit every time it false alerts.
[01:08:24.257 --> 01:08:25.398]  Bring the dog back out.
[01:08:25.799 --> 01:08:26.759]  I don't have any drugs.
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:32.043]  You're a classic pastor like Paul who goes and puts tile in and is a carpenter.
[01:08:32.363 --> 01:08:34.785]  You're driving back from California, you know, doing your work.
[01:08:35.225 --> 01:08:36.405]  You're not putting up with it.
[01:08:36.825 --> 01:08:43.767]  And they now put our children through their naked body scanners and store their naked images on the computer for biometric scanning.
[01:08:44.227 --> 01:08:46.767]  They now are training us more and more to be slaves.
[01:08:47.248 --> 01:08:52.169]  And they know if they start having a revolt of the ants, it's over for them.
[01:08:52.489 --> 01:08:57.550]  And so they are scared to death of people that say, I am not your slave.
[01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.490]  It's over.
[01:08:58.850 --> 01:09:00.150]  I'm not cowed by you.
[01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:01.290]  I've done nothing wrong.
[01:09:01.611 --> 01:09:03.531]  And when you try to oppress me, you're a criminal.
[01:09:05.737 --> 01:09:05.977]  Right.
[01:09:06.037 --> 01:09:09.162]  And they're trying to punish me and break me down.
[01:09:09.822 --> 01:09:18.714]  And they're trying to just basically make my life as miserable as possible by, you know, trying to ruin my business, trying to ruin my church, trying to, you know, ruin my life.
[01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:19.775]  But you know what?
[01:09:20.476 --> 01:09:21.598]  They just keep on trying.
[01:09:21.618 --> 01:09:22.118]  But you know what?
[01:09:22.599 --> 01:09:23.720]  I am not going to take back
[01:09:24.461 --> 01:09:26.182]  What God said thousands of years ago.
[01:09:26.202 --> 01:09:29.723]  You know, who am I to contradict God Almighty?
[01:09:30.443 --> 01:09:34.325]  And so, these people can say what they want, but you know what?
[01:09:34.365 --> 01:09:36.666]  It's not going to change what the Bible says.
[01:09:36.726 --> 01:09:48.150]  These Christians, who are basically spoon-fed by their pastor, a few choice scriptures from the Bible, a few feel-good sermons, who've never read the Bible cover-to-cover, Genesis to Revelation,
[01:09:48.775 --> 01:09:49.857]  You know, they're ignorant.
[01:09:50.217 --> 01:09:51.359]  They think I'm hateful.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:53.542]  They think I'm wrong.
[01:09:53.662 --> 01:09:54.223]  But you know what?
[01:09:54.243 --> 01:09:58.870]  The Bible makes it clear that there are people that we should not be praying for their good.
[01:09:59.311 --> 01:10:03.657]  God said three times in the book of Jeremiah, pray not for this people.
[01:10:04.338 --> 01:10:08.142]  He said, because of their wickedness, he said, if you pray for them, I will not hear you.
[01:10:08.502 --> 01:10:21.174]  I know, and what is this weird thing that Hitler and Stalin did, where they say, it's Romans 13, pray for your leaders, but when the founding fathers and everybody else stood up against tyranny, I mean, that is completely false doctrine.
[01:10:22.785 --> 01:10:29.108]  It's definitely false doctrine, and it comes from just a very narrow view of the Bible, where they've heard a few feel-good passages.
[01:10:29.488 --> 01:10:34.050]  You know, they've heard the part about Jesus telling you to love your enemies, which I do love my enemies.
[01:10:34.150 --> 01:10:35.430]  I only hate God's enemies.
[01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:38.732]  I only hate the violent, wicked, evil-doers of this world.
[01:10:39.052 --> 01:10:41.073]  I don't hate my personal enemies who do me wrong.
[01:10:41.273 --> 01:10:45.695]  You know, the people who beat me up at the border patrol checkpoint, I prayed for them.
[01:10:45.915 --> 01:10:47.435]  You know, I asked God to forgive them.
[01:10:47.495 --> 01:10:48.776]  I don't have any hard feelings toward them.
[01:10:49.176 --> 01:10:50.137]  They're not the problem.
[01:10:50.157 --> 01:10:51.378]  They're just brainwashed.
[01:10:53.159 --> 01:10:57.582]  It's the people up top that are evil, and they're the ones who God needs to judge.
[01:10:57.863 --> 01:11:03.767]  I was saying to the guys in uniform, forgive them, father, for they know not what they do, because they're just brainwashed.
[01:11:03.807 --> 01:11:04.908]  They're just following training.
[01:11:05.408 --> 01:11:06.749]  They grew up on TV or whatever.
[01:11:06.769 --> 01:11:08.751]  They don't know what's really going on.
[01:11:09.574 --> 01:11:28.363]  But the bottom line is this, okay, people have a very limited understanding of what the Bible teaches because they're not reading it cover to cover, and they're going to a church that's more interested in popularity, building a bigger building, making more money, and is not interested in really telling them what the Bible actually preaches and teaches.
[01:11:28.683 --> 01:11:29.343]  That's the problem.
[01:11:32.383 --> 01:11:35.565]  Well, this is really creepy on CNN with them calling for your arrest.
[01:11:36.126 --> 01:11:36.706]  I mean, look at this.
[01:11:36.806 --> 01:11:38.728]  I see these kind of articles every day.
[01:11:39.448 --> 01:11:42.811]  Democratic Party official accused in satanic rape, kidnap.
[01:11:43.211 --> 01:11:47.814]  Woman, husband said to shackle victims to beds, keep them in dog cages without food.
[01:11:48.855 --> 01:11:59.621]  And how many CPS workers, how many Homeland Security officials, how many people investigating child abuse, it turns out, aren't just child rapists, they're Satanists.
[01:11:59.701 --> 01:12:01.902]  I mean, these people are everywhere.
[01:12:02.242 --> 01:12:04.103]  This is the religion of the world.
[01:12:04.423 --> 01:12:07.665]  In fact, guys, show this video for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:12:07.685 --> 01:12:08.665]  Here's the article right here.
[01:12:11.046 --> 01:12:12.207]  We just lost the pastor.
[01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:13.067]  We're going to get him
[01:12:17.489 --> 01:12:24.792]  Back on the show, right now, coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:12:25.913 --> 01:12:42.361]  But, you know, even if you're not a Christian, the point is the establishment is always saying, you shouldn't have a religion, God isn't real, but then you find out the elites who are saying they're atheists, nine times out of ten in my research, they turn out to be a cultist who are Luciferian or Satanist.
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:50.082]  And they're really obsessed with all the voodoo and all the superstition and all this, you know, religiosity.
[01:12:51.842 --> 01:12:53.323]  But again, here's the article.
[01:12:53.603 --> 01:12:57.464]  Democratic Party official accused in satanic rape, kidnap.
[01:12:57.564 --> 01:13:00.465]  Women husband said to shackle victims to beds.
[01:13:01.905 --> 01:13:04.946]  Keep them in dog cages without food.
[01:13:05.919 --> 01:13:15.425]  A Democratic Party official and her husband are facing charges in connection with alleged satanic rituals involving the kidnap, rape, and starvation of another couple in North Carolina.
[01:13:15.806 --> 01:13:27.353]  Joy Johnson, 30, a vice chairwoman of the Durham County Democratic Party and vice chairwoman of the Young Democrats, made an appearance in court yesterday after she and her spouse, Joseph Craig, were arrested Friday.
[01:13:27.393 --> 01:13:34.218]  Craig, 25, is charged with second-degree rape, secondary kidnapping, and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon in an incident in January and another in May.
[01:13:34.818 --> 01:13:37.303]  Johnson is charged with two counts of aiding and abetting.
[01:13:37.323 --> 01:13:43.254]  According to published broadcast reports, prosecutors said a man and a woman met Craig through a shared interest in Satan worship.
[01:13:44.301 --> 01:13:52.044]  Although the couple never consented to any physical abuse, Craig allegedly shackled his victims to bed, keeping them in dog cages and starved them inside his home.
[01:13:52.564 --> 01:13:56.086]  Police said he beat the man with a cane and a cord and raped the woman.
[01:13:56.106 --> 01:13:57.266]  See, it's all about power.
[01:13:57.646 --> 01:14:01.788]  And it's always pot-bellied, weak chicken necks that seethe with weakness.
[01:14:02.448 --> 01:14:05.529]  And that's why they love getting control of public schools and kids.
[01:14:06.169 --> 01:14:09.191]  And that's why the old wives' tales are, the Satanists come for your kids.
[01:14:09.431 --> 01:14:09.871]  They do!
[01:14:10.471 --> 01:14:12.132]  They hate innocence, they hate goodness.
[01:14:13.834 --> 01:14:16.857]  They tell us to be nice and just stand down and go along with their crap.
[01:14:17.798 --> 01:14:20.140]  I'll tell you this, I'm not standing down to their crap.
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:21.321]  We have Pastor back.
[01:14:22.021 --> 01:14:23.222]  Pastor, we lost your phone.
[01:14:25.344 --> 01:14:34.272]  Constantly, we see the Satanists and what they're doing, and they always say, oh, oh yeah, we're into the occult, but it's not satanic, and then I've gone and investigated it.
[01:14:34.473 --> 01:14:38.576]  It's always manipulation, control, domination, mind games.
[01:14:38.837 --> 01:14:40.138]  You look at these occultists,
[01:14:42.089 --> 01:14:44.793]  It's almost identical to psychiatry and psychologists.
[01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:50.100]  And then I discovered this is just a brand of occultist manipulation and mind control.
[01:14:50.341 --> 01:14:52.163]  These are just control freak scum!
[01:14:53.285 --> 01:14:54.367]  Pastor, your comments?
[01:14:55.652 --> 01:15:07.298]  Hey, you're so right, and it's amazing how I grew up as a Baptist, and when I was a child in Baptist churches, there was all kinds of preaching against the whole modern psychiatry, psychology, the dope.
[01:15:07.779 --> 01:15:11.040]  There was preaching against the one world government, the mark of the beast.
[01:15:11.881 --> 01:15:13.902]  I'm just wondering, where has that preaching gone?
[01:15:14.602 --> 01:15:17.544]  Because you're right, the modern psychology is satanic.
[01:15:18.414 --> 01:15:24.198]  And, you know, Satanism, they start the kids on it early with the Harry Potter, you know, and then it goes from there.
[01:15:24.639 --> 01:15:32.344]  And they teach them that witchcraft is fun, it's cool, you know, to perform spells and to... Well, I'll tell you, in high school this stuff was rampant.
[01:15:32.985 --> 01:15:39.750]  And these people were all control freaks, screwed up, their parents were into it, and these were just unhappy, screwed up people!
[01:15:41.061 --> 01:15:43.243]  And you know, I'm tired of them trying to run my life!
[01:15:43.263 --> 01:15:49.488]  If they want a war, they're going to get one, and these little bastards never figure that out until they squeal and beg.
[01:15:50.408 --> 01:15:53.431]  And, you know, we don't take any pleasure in when they go into the fire.
[01:15:53.471 --> 01:15:54.311]  It's a sad thing.
[01:15:57.514 --> 01:15:58.575]  Comments on that, Pelosi?
[01:15:59.835 --> 01:16:00.516]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:16:01.096 --> 01:16:03.598]  And, you know, I just want to say this.
[01:16:03.618 --> 01:16:08.022]  I don't know if you remember this, Alex, but do you remember what Jesse Jackson said about Obama?
[01:16:11.261 --> 01:16:23.349]  Well, the one that I wanted to draw attention to was the clip a while back where he didn't know that the cameras were rolling and he said, you know, I don't want to say it on the air because it's kind of obscene, but he said, I want to cut his blank off.
[01:16:23.850 --> 01:16:26.652]  Did you ever see that clip of Jesse Jackson saying that?
[01:16:26.672 --> 01:16:26.792]  Yes.
[01:16:26.852 --> 01:16:31.455]  And it's amazing how, you know, I'm just praying a prayer out of the Bible.
[01:16:32.670 --> 01:16:43.401]  And all this fire, all this outrage, why aren't people flipping out about, you know, what Jesse Jackson said, which was obscene and which was actually a direct threat, saying, I want to do this to him.
[01:16:44.362 --> 01:16:51.450]  Well, that's just because Jackson, who led Martin Luther King out to the balcony, is a total globalist and just jealous of Obama.
[01:16:51.730 --> 01:16:53.412]  I mean, the elites all hate each other.
[01:16:54.648 --> 01:17:10.713]  And here's the thing, I'm just kind of a handy guy for them right now, to pull out right now, and I'm basically the guy that they're using to get people mad at Christians, to get people mad at Baptists or Fundamentalists, or people that are, you know, libertarian-minded.
[01:17:10.973 --> 01:17:20.916]  They're just kind of pulling me out and demonizing me, and they can find all the, you know, incendiary clips in my preaching and use them to get all the sheep all fired up and mad.
[01:17:21.276 --> 01:17:21.796]  But you know what?
[01:17:22.056 --> 01:17:24.157]  I'm sorry, I'm not going to sit there
[01:17:25.093 --> 01:17:28.854]  And preach my sermons according to what's going to happen politically.
[01:17:28.874 --> 01:17:30.794]  You know, whatever's going to happen politically is going to happen.
[01:17:30.814 --> 01:17:31.435]  That's not my job.
[01:17:31.455 --> 01:17:32.075]  I'm not a politician.
[01:17:35.095 --> 01:17:38.656]  Well, in the past the establishment can cow us with all of this.
[01:17:39.937 --> 01:17:46.098]  I hope the establishment realizes that if they stage terror attacks and try to blame it on us, this is going to get out of control for everybody.
[01:17:46.778 --> 01:17:51.139]  So I just want things not to become escalated.
[01:17:51.179 --> 01:17:53.220]  But, you know, it's all in God's hands as you say, Pastor.
[01:17:54.321 --> 01:17:58.422]  I want to come back and get into the whole issue of firearms and members of your church.
[01:17:58.762 --> 01:18:04.204]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:18:04.464 --> 01:18:05.725]  And we knew what to do.
[01:18:05.745 --> 01:18:07.545]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:18:07.785 --> 01:18:14.207]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:18:14.807 --> 01:18:23.330]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:18:23.717 --> 01:18:30.522]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:18:30.823 --> 01:18:33.865]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:18:33.985 --> 01:18:39.229]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:18:39.769 --> 01:18:42.391]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:18:42.852 --> 01:18:49.417]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[01:18:52.346 --> 01:18:52.727]  I don't know.
[01:19:09.318 --> 01:19:09.959]  We're good to go.
[01:19:39.138 --> 01:19:39.939]  We're good to go.
[01:19:58.211 --> 01:20:01.194]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graff Hunter safes.
[01:20:01.394 --> 01:20:05.018]  The makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[01:20:05.158 --> 01:20:07.741]  Graff Hunter safes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[01:20:08.021 --> 01:20:12.466]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.
[01:20:12.646 --> 01:20:17.071]  Whether it's a custom-fitted vault door safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[01:20:17.151 --> 01:20:19.033]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[01:20:19.173 --> 01:20:19.533]  That's right.
[01:20:38.626 --> 01:20:41.747]  Steve Quayle is coming up for a full hour in T-minus six minutes.
[01:21:09.292 --> 01:21:21.182]  I want to get Pastor Anderson and Chris, the fellow with the AR-15 strapped to his back, back on the show coming up in the next few weeks as this develops, as they are doing a massive demonization campaign.
[01:21:21.922 --> 01:21:25.805]  And the point is, the police don't mind the guns out in the open, because that's people's rights.
[01:21:26.306 --> 01:21:28.107]  The police are worried about the hidden guns.
[01:21:28.888 --> 01:21:30.289]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:21:30.309 --> 01:21:31.570]  There's concealed carry everywhere.
[01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:32.831]  It's just asinine.
[01:21:34.092 --> 01:21:38.375]  By the way, this Sanchez fellow from CNN was at WSVN-TV.
[01:21:40.103 --> 01:21:40.263]  I don't
[01:21:57.645 --> 01:21:59.665]  The Morning Joe with Scarborough.
[01:21:59.725 --> 01:22:01.366]  I mean, a lot of these guys are compromised.
[01:22:01.406 --> 01:22:02.486]  I think that's what's going on here.
[01:22:03.106 --> 01:22:09.688]  You know, separately, the White House is withdrawing calls for students to help Obama, but he's still going to start these video addresses.
[01:22:10.268 --> 01:22:17.369]  Remember back in the early 90s, they put in TV sets for Channel One, and it was connected to this weird foundation with the government?
[01:22:17.889 --> 01:22:20.390]  And now the President will, I need your help, children.
[01:22:21.290 --> 01:22:22.270]  Work with your President.
[01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:24.111]  Help your parents understand.
[01:22:24.171 --> 01:22:25.131]  And now he is
[01:22:26.286 --> 01:22:32.528]  Czar is saying that green jobs is an incremental takeover of the society and economy.
[01:22:33.008 --> 01:22:34.348]  And we have the clips.
[01:22:34.368 --> 01:22:35.428]  We're going to play this coming up.
[01:22:36.629 --> 01:22:40.050]  We have the clips here of Gore saying, question your parents.
[01:22:40.090 --> 01:22:41.090]  Your parents are bad.
[01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:43.171]  They're lying to you about global warming.
[01:22:44.571 --> 01:22:46.251]  They really are trying to take over our families.
[01:22:46.732 --> 01:22:47.772]  Comments on that.
[01:22:48.932 --> 01:22:50.393]  I mean, this is the revolution.
[01:22:50.693 --> 01:22:51.973]  We're not the revolutionaries.
[01:22:52.353 --> 01:22:55.514]  These foreign offshore banks are the ones trying to take over our society, Pastor.
[01:22:56.519 --> 01:23:02.062]  Right, Alex, and I've actually been explaining to people for years that we are not the revolution, we are the counter-revolution.
[01:23:02.562 --> 01:23:12.068]  We're not trying to change our form of government, we're trying to get back to what our government's supposed to be in the Constitution, and there's a left-wing, communist takeover going on right now.
[01:23:12.108 --> 01:23:14.169]  That's the revolution, and we're the counter-revolution.
[01:23:14.649 --> 01:23:17.751]  And, you know, the public schools have already been a brainwashing center for years.
[01:23:18.351 --> 01:23:22.036]  So, you know, now they're just adding a little video fireside chat with Obama.
[01:23:22.576 --> 01:23:28.023]  It's just more of the same that they're getting the whole rest of the day in these, you know, left-wing agenda government schools.
[01:23:28.964 --> 01:23:30.866]  So it's probably nothing new for them.
[01:23:33.209 --> 01:23:36.072]  Well, I mean, it's overtly
[01:23:38.152 --> 01:23:38.752]  It's unbelievable.
[01:23:38.832 --> 01:23:40.913]  I can't believe how fast it's happening.
[01:24:04.437 --> 01:24:08.761]  You know, I mean, I would have never believed one year ago that we'd be where we're at right now.
[01:24:09.581 --> 01:24:15.446]  It's unbelievable how fast it's happening, and I think the good thing about how fast it's happening is that it's waking people up.
[01:24:15.607 --> 01:24:25.775]  Because a lot of people that I talked to maybe a year ago, a year and a half ago, they were still just kind of drinking the Republican Kool-Aid, and they thought everything was wonderful, but you just get the Republicans elected.
[01:24:26.256 --> 01:24:27.717]  But now you're talking to those same people.
[01:24:27.757 --> 01:24:29.959]  They're starting to realize that the whole government is corrupt.
[01:24:30.883 --> 01:24:37.965]  And the good thing about Obama getting elected and this going so quickly is that it's shocking people into reality.
[01:24:38.946 --> 01:24:44.988]  And they're not asleep at the wheel like they were with George W. Bush, who was pretty much doing most of the same policies as Obama.
[01:24:45.588 --> 01:24:54.251]  Obama has accelerated it so much that at least people are waking people up and, you know, the frog is about to jump out of the hot water because it's getting so hot so fast.
[01:24:55.253 --> 01:24:55.994]  Well, more than that...
[01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:25.831]  He's smart bombing weddings and funerals in Pakistan and Afghanistan, expanding wars, funding abortion worldwide, forced abortion.
[01:25:26.472 --> 01:25:28.452]  I mean, he's a front man for a gang of killers.
[01:25:29.032 --> 01:25:31.672]  And so it's a way to make him the victim.
[01:25:31.712 --> 01:25:32.053]  You're right.
[01:25:32.393 --> 01:25:33.393]  Pastor, God bless you.
[01:25:33.413 --> 01:25:34.473]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:25:35.333 --> 01:25:35.753]  Thanks.

[01:25:48.271 --> 01:25:53.275]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:25:53.475 --> 01:25:57.277]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:25:57.498 --> 01:26:03.122]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:26:03.422 --> 01:26:03.882]  It's true.
[01:26:04.062 --> 01:26:08.285]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:26:08.485 --> 01:26:08.986]  Number three,
[01:26:09.386 --> 01:26:14.828]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:26:15.688 --> 01:26:18.329]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:26:18.589 --> 01:26:22.010]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:26:23.111 --> 01:26:26.712]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:26:26.952 --> 01:26:32.433]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:19.061]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:27:20.781 --> 01:27:21.842]  Best-selling author.
[01:27:21.862 --> 01:27:24.282]  Syndicated radio host.
[01:27:25.103 --> 01:27:25.623]  Patriot.
[01:27:26.203 --> 01:27:28.104]  Steve Quill joins us for the next 60 minutes.
[01:27:29.104 --> 01:27:29.464]  Steve,
[01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:37.532]  I know we've covered the basics on the flu, the background, the preparation, the different scenarios that could unfold.
[01:27:38.293 --> 01:27:42.214]  You've been doing it since 1996 saying you believe that was the vehicle they were going to use.
[01:27:43.114 --> 01:27:50.697]  We saw them setting up the mass graves, the crematoriums, the federal takeover drills, the forced inoculation preparation in December, January, February.
[01:27:51.277 --> 01:27:56.119]  So we really got concerned in April when they mobilized and launched the fear-mongering
[01:27:57.586 --> 01:27:58.926]  Is the virus really deadly?
[01:27:59.247 --> 01:28:00.687]  Is it the cover for something else?
[01:28:00.867 --> 01:28:03.168]  Are they gonna have mega-deaths like they're saying?
[01:28:03.588 --> 01:28:08.850]  Now they're announcing quarantines, forced inoculations, lockdowns.
[01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:12.071]  400,000 troops the Army's announced they want to put on the streets of America.
[01:28:12.311 --> 01:28:13.871]  From 4,000 last year to 20,000 in January to 40,000 in April to now 400,000.
[01:28:19.494 --> 01:28:21.897]  Uh, they're really pulling out all the stops.
[01:28:22.418 --> 01:28:25.582]  So I don't want to just... I mean, people understand something's wrong.
[01:28:26.003 --> 01:28:31.230]  The question is, will they just use this fear-mongering as the cover for a federal takeover?
[01:28:31.671 --> 01:28:34.295]  It's perfect with the flubbing worldwide for a global UN.
[01:28:35.717 --> 01:28:38.900]  Take over to be coupled with an economic collapse in the fall.
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:44.065]  If we expose their agenda, will they back off and not carry it out?
[01:28:44.946 --> 01:28:46.127]  What are the different angles?
[01:28:46.227 --> 01:28:55.036]  I want to cover every facet, but first, in the three minutes, four minutes we got before break, just recapping with your intel what we're facing.
[01:28:56.084 --> 01:29:08.929]  First of all, Alex, the 400,000 troops, I caught a lot of flack from people when I said there are that many foreign troops here, meaning NATO troops and other third world countries that have been literally hired by our government for this very position.
[01:29:09.349 --> 01:29:13.450]  On record as stating on your show a number of times, 345,000 were told to me by special operations people.
[01:29:15.791 --> 01:29:16.493]  No, you're right.
[01:29:16.513 --> 01:29:17.274]  In fact, I forgot.
[01:29:17.314 --> 01:29:18.236]  I am interrupting.
[01:29:18.556 --> 01:29:24.167]  You said three months ago and then a month ago, on this show, 340-something thou, and now they're saying 390-something thou.
[01:29:27.213 --> 01:29:27.693]  You got it.
[01:29:28.154 --> 01:29:29.435]  So, and let me share this.
[01:29:29.555 --> 01:29:38.684]  The thing that's important, everyone needs to watch the universities and different schools around the country because we're seeing clustering of lockdowns and quarantining, Alex.
[01:29:38.704 --> 01:29:40.745]  This is exactly how it was meant to go.
[01:29:41.126 --> 01:29:52.957]  Interestingly enough, most of these universities have at least a microbiology department, but it's fascinating that when you do it in a university setting or a school setting, you have in essence a contained group
[01:29:53.397 --> 01:30:05.426]  So if something gets out of the hands of the handlers who have initiated this and intentionally released this flu, then the point is that you've got a very captive audience and you can do what's necessary at the time.
[01:30:05.606 --> 01:30:12.831]  I believe that the whole thing that we saw earlier this year, as you and I both were on record stating this, is not the real thing.
[01:30:13.351 --> 01:30:14.932]  This is a scare tactic.
[01:30:14.972 --> 01:30:24.135]  You remember, you had me pray, and we prayed, and the bottom line is all the people out there, by the way, Alex, are praying for your safety right now, and I just got an email saying that you'd ask for prayer.
[01:30:24.175 --> 01:30:36.019]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's never been more important than you to keep Alex and his family in your prayers, and I'm telling you this, Alex, this is going for it, but it's going for it in a different way, and this is important for people to understand.
[01:30:37.799 --> 01:30:49.102]  The amount of intel coming into me from all my sources of helicopters landing in the desert southwest of the United States, different states, and European and foreign bikers.
[01:30:49.162 --> 01:30:52.262]  I'm talking about motorcyclists, usually on BMWs or foreign bikes.
[01:30:52.542 --> 01:30:57.543]  No, no, that's confirmed in NLE09, troops from 14 countries, FEMA.gov.
[01:30:57.984 --> 01:30:59.404]  You got it, but here's what I'm saying.
[01:31:00.124 --> 01:31:04.185]  There are eyewitnesses, and these are credible and multiple sources.
[01:31:04.545 --> 01:31:05.326]  We're good to go.
[01:31:27.422 --> 01:31:36.125]  Well, I remember you in February talking about how they were getting ready for the flu, and trucks moving around, and weird shipments, and here we are!
[01:31:37.286 --> 01:31:37.586]  Right.
[01:31:38.406 --> 01:31:43.288]  Well, I think the thing is that we're there now, and so again, this is something that I think is important.
[01:31:43.408 --> 01:31:44.269]  Are they going for it?
[01:31:44.449 --> 01:31:45.129]  Absolutely.
[01:31:45.209 --> 01:31:52.472]  Never, never miss a chance to utilize a good crisis to bring about the new world order, but there's something that's happening in the last... Stay there, stay there.
[01:31:52.512 --> 01:31:53.752]  Finish up with the motorcycles.
[01:31:54.392 --> 01:31:54.613]  Okay.
[01:31:54.633 --> 01:31:55.593]  When we get back, stay there.
[01:31:58.527 --> 01:32:01.128]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:01.528 --> 01:32:06.490]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:06.851 --> 01:32:08.591]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:08.911 --> 01:32:13.714]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:13.914 --> 01:32:14.874]  How much do you want?
[01:32:15.094 --> 01:32:15.834]  When do you want it?
[01:32:16.215 --> 01:32:17.815]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:18.095 --> 01:32:18.916]  When will you need it?
[01:32:19.176 --> 01:32:21.237]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:21.377 --> 01:32:22.477]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:22.717 --> 01:32:24.018]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:24.238 --> 01:32:29.304]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:29.504 --> 01:32:32.688]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:33.089 --> 01:32:36.593]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:36.913 --> 01:32:37.894]  How much will you need?
[01:32:38.155 --> 01:32:38.755]  We don't know.
[01:32:39.036 --> 01:32:39.957]  How much do you want?
[01:32:40.157 --> 01:32:40.858]  All you can get.
[01:32:41.058 --> 01:32:41.919]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:42.159 --> 01:32:44.922]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:45.202 --> 01:32:48.325]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:48.345 --> 01:32:49.106]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:57.571 --> 01:33:01.553]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:33:01.813 --> 01:33:03.594]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:33:03.814 --> 01:33:12.098]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:33:12.338 --> 01:33:17.561]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:33:17.881 --> 01:33:19.502]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:33:19.742 --> 01:33:26.066]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:33:26.266 --> 01:33:37.012]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:33:37.312 --> 01:33:37.772]  That's right.
[01:33:38.072 --> 01:33:39.012]  We're good to go.

[01:34:59.890 --> 01:35:05.902]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:35:06.524 --> 01:35:09.490]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:25.711 --> 01:35:32.287]  Alright, Steve Quayle, recap what your intel's saying they're deploying with motorcyclists.
[01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:36.681]  Are they deploying something, or are they receiving a vaccine?
[01:35:36.701 --> 01:35:43.664]  No, Alex, they're being given the bio-agent to release at a coordinated time across the country.
[01:35:43.684 --> 01:35:49.267]  Because, look, everybody knows that in the late summer, going into the fall, there's a lot of guys that are biking on the roads.
[01:35:49.307 --> 01:35:55.570]  But what's fascinating is the ability of the bikers to draw less attention than, let's say, Humvees or
[01:35:56.150 --> 01:35:59.593]  Dark Denali's or Yukon's or Suburbans or whatever.
[01:35:59.633 --> 01:36:03.917]  So what is interesting to this though is I believe there are multiple strains.
[01:36:03.937 --> 01:36:05.519]  This is what people have got to understand.
[01:36:05.939 --> 01:36:11.825]  There are multiple strains that have been developed to check all along the efficacy
[01:36:12.425 --> 01:36:13.366]  We're good to go.
[01:36:35.723 --> 01:36:39.185]  All Eastern Europeans, and they basically got very nervous.
[01:36:39.225 --> 01:36:43.108]  He also had his 45 tucked into his pants.
[01:36:43.148 --> 01:36:46.890]  And when they saw the pants, they all looked at the head.
[01:36:49.152 --> 01:36:54.435]  The bikers that weren't the leader looked at the leader for basically his indication of what to do.
[01:36:55.596 --> 01:36:57.198]  Put his hand out like do nothing.
[01:36:57.578 --> 01:37:02.242]  So the point is is that what I think that people have got to understand is is that the clustering.
[01:37:02.262 --> 01:37:03.864]  Now here's what everybody's got to understand.
[01:37:04.404 --> 01:37:13.713]  There are specific specific intel links that go to Kansas University and some of the other universities of specific scientists here
[01:37:14.233 --> 01:37:15.774]  Now let me stop you!
[01:37:35.447 --> 01:37:47.431]  They are now this week having quarantines over people having the flu at universities all over the country to beta test in a controlled area where they just show up and tell the young students you can't leave.
[01:37:48.091 --> 01:37:56.413]  The states are passing laws to conform with the executive order that conforms with World Health Organization level 6 martial law rules.
[01:37:56.974 --> 01:38:01.175]  So the point is the safety is off, the trigger is cocked, the tyranny gun
[01:38:02.035 --> 01:38:23.228]  is to our head and yes we've confirmed and had guests on universities all over the country months ago and then reports weeks ago are having National Guard regular army doing drills of locking down the universities so clearly they were drilling to have that be the beta test to show everybody a lockdown
[01:38:24.088 --> 01:38:42.932]  So everyone is acclimated so we see the phasing and the scripting even before April when all of this started with the emergency managers at the city and county level in Indiana and Illinois and New York on this show and with the documents as the feds were saying flu will come this year millions will die
[01:38:43.192 --> 01:38:44.513]  There will be mass graves.
[01:38:44.553 --> 01:38:45.454]  This is not a drill.
[01:38:45.814 --> 01:38:48.736]  Now the question is, are they planning to go with a real flu?
[01:38:49.156 --> 01:38:51.077]  Or will the pathogen be in the shot?
[01:38:51.437 --> 01:38:53.399]  Or will it be in both to scare people?
[01:38:53.679 --> 01:38:57.021]  And some of the vaccines, not in some of the other different releases.
[01:38:57.061 --> 01:38:59.623]  We know top virologists have said it is an engineered flu.
[01:38:59.963 --> 01:39:02.505]  Or is this just the fear-mongering of the flu?
[01:39:02.805 --> 01:39:12.351]  The cover to get the NORTHCOM assets and other centralized command systems and other nations in place under the cover of the flu hysteria.
[01:39:13.035 --> 01:39:13.816]  Well, let me say this.
[01:39:13.896 --> 01:39:17.919]  It's going to be an integration of the flu to cover the financial disaster that's in the making.
[01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:25.166]  And you can't separate the fact that the international elite want to rid the planet of the population.
[01:39:25.206 --> 01:39:30.150]  You and I have done years and years of validation and verification of all their different statements.
[01:39:30.610 --> 01:39:32.132]  Now we have, in the last 48 hours, China
[01:39:33.773 --> 01:39:44.495]  Uh, firing a shot across the financial bow, basically saying we won't take any more of America's junk paper, declaring the whole class of financial instruments as derivatives, as junk.
[01:39:44.935 --> 01:39:46.215]  And gold is exploding?
[01:39:46.635 --> 01:39:47.455]  Gold is exploding.
[01:39:47.515 --> 01:39:49.536]  And what that, why that's critical, Alex, is this.
[01:39:50.216 --> 01:39:53.277]  The idea is that America was raped, pillaged, and plundered.
[01:39:53.297 --> 01:39:58.017]  And everybody that knows their pirate history will know that after you've raped, pillaged, and plundered, what do you do?
[01:39:58.057 --> 01:39:59.378]  You burn the cities, okay?
[01:39:59.878 --> 01:40:01.298]  And what's tragic is that
[01:40:02.043 --> 01:40:19.934]  I don't believe people in this country recognize how in the hell, and it's hell, literally the abomination that rises from hell, can we send all our troops to Afghanistan and Iraq and meanwhile we're importing foreigners and we're seeing the pre-positioning of mini-materials all over the country?
[01:40:19.994 --> 01:40:22.175]  You remember all the crap I caught when I said
[01:40:22.595 --> 01:40:27.959]  There are, you know, 345,000 people in this country, and all of a sudden now it's stated.
[01:40:28.039 --> 01:40:30.180]  So how do you get that when the U.S.
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:32.722]  military is saying, we don't have enough men to send over there?
[01:40:32.742 --> 01:40:35.263]  But all of a sudden, the magic number, 395,000 show up.
[01:40:38.205 --> 01:40:40.386]  Well, I mean, NLE09.
[01:40:40.446 --> 01:40:43.528]  Guys, put FEMA up on screen for people at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:40:43.868 --> 01:40:45.969]  Radio Lister could just Google NLE09.
[01:40:46.409 --> 01:40:49.411]  And the top link that comes up is FEMA.gov.
[01:40:54.193 --> 01:41:01.795]  I've had, Alex, since you and I did the last show together, when I was on with you last, I've had multiple law enforcement and military contacts
[01:41:17.459 --> 01:41:24.962]  Absolutely, tell me that they're noticing foreign observers assigned to the Sheriff's Department, the Highway Patrol, State Patrol, whatever you call it.
[01:41:24.982 --> 01:41:28.483]  But one of the guys said, Steve, he said, look, I'm XSF, Special Forces.
[01:41:28.543 --> 01:41:30.543]  And he said, I know I hit her when I see one.
[01:41:30.784 --> 01:41:32.004]  He said, I was one!
[01:41:32.464 --> 01:41:34.545]  And I said, well, and I'm just making this name up.
[01:41:34.585 --> 01:41:35.465]  His name is not Mike.
[01:41:35.525 --> 01:41:37.246]  I said, well, Mike, then you know what he's there for.
[01:41:37.326 --> 01:41:44.529]  And here's what this man, who's a former Special Forces, a major law enforcement, and a hero to the law enforcement community, said.
[01:41:44.869 --> 01:41:51.272]  He said, I know he's here to take out us after we've been ordered to do the unconstitutional and the immoral.
[01:41:51.652 --> 01:41:54.173]  And he said, me and my men are not going to do it.
[01:41:54.233 --> 01:41:55.894]  So, Alex, what I'm saying to you is this.
[01:41:56.534 --> 01:42:06.837]  The pre-positioning of foreign observer slash assassins has already been integrated into many, not all, but many of the law enforcement agencies across the United States.
[01:42:07.117 --> 01:42:17.220]  That is, you and I have spoken about Marcus Wolff, we have spoken about Yevgeny Primakov, we have spoken about the Department of Homeland Security hiring them, and these are standard.
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:18.582]  We're good to go.
[01:42:29.905 --> 01:42:33.550]  I would imagine he's going to comfort them during the flu.
[01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:35.192]  This is going to be the whole kickoff.
[01:42:35.232 --> 01:42:36.233]  He's not saying that.
[01:42:36.674 --> 01:42:37.935]  In fact, I'm glad you brought that up.
[01:42:37.995 --> 01:42:38.816]  I want to do that now.
[01:42:38.896 --> 01:42:44.723]  Van Jones, who works for the White House, he's a czar over communications and community organizing.
[01:42:45.204 --> 01:42:47.366]  The tens of billions they're handing out to these groups.
[01:42:48.167 --> 01:43:00.115]  We're getting videos, reports, local news, them in the red and black uniforms, knocking on doors, threatening people on video, beating people up at town halls, biting fingers off, Associated Press.
[01:43:00.215 --> 01:43:02.597]  I mean, folks, you cannot make this up.
[01:43:02.637 --> 01:43:07.140]  We have Al Gore on audio saying, don't, you know, report on your parents.
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:09.201]  They're liars about global warming.
[01:43:09.261 --> 01:43:10.002]  You know best.
[01:43:10.702 --> 01:43:15.645]  We've got Obama to address the students, asking for their help in his agenda.
[01:43:15.706 --> 01:43:17.467]  I mean, folks, you cannot
[01:43:18.147 --> 01:43:21.228]  Again, I can't believe this is happening in America.
[01:43:21.248 --> 01:43:23.749]  I mean, even though I knew it was coming, it's now here.
[01:43:23.809 --> 01:43:32.652]  It's kind of like, the bully says he's meeting you after school, the school day's over, you walk out, there he is, he weighs 50 pounds more than you, and the fight's on.
[01:43:32.672 --> 01:43:38.954]  I mean, the bully is now about to punch us in the nose, his arm is moving, and
[01:43:40.094 --> 01:43:43.296]  And then the Media Matters says I'm a criminal and none of this exists.
[01:43:43.617 --> 01:43:50.982]  Here is Van Jones, the community organizing bully, saying on syndicated radio what's happening.
[01:43:51.022 --> 01:43:51.382]  Here it is.
[01:43:56.045 --> 01:44:01.547]  That we don't understand the relationship between minimum goals and maximum goals.
[01:44:02.607 --> 01:44:22.154]  Right after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat, if the civil rights leaders had jumped out and said, okay, now we want reparations for slavery, we want redistribution of all wealth, and we want to legalize mixed marriages, they'd come out with a maximum program the very next day, they'd have been laughed at.
[01:44:22.814 --> 01:44:24.535]  Instead, they came out with a very minimum program.
[01:44:25.315 --> 01:44:26.836]  Yeah, we just want to integrate these buses.
[01:44:27.736 --> 01:44:30.658]  The students a few years later come out with a very minimum program.
[01:44:30.698 --> 01:44:32.999]  We just want to sit at the lunch counter.
[01:44:33.399 --> 01:44:38.261]  But inside that minimum demand was a very radical kernel.
[01:44:39.053 --> 01:44:46.794]  That eventually meant that from 1954-1968, you know, a complete revolution was on the table for this country.
[01:44:47.235 --> 01:44:50.235]  And I think that this Green Movement has to pursue those same steps and stages.
[01:44:50.635 --> 01:45:03.198]  Right now we're saying we want to move from suicidal, grey capitalism to some kind of eco-capitalism, where, you know, at least we're not, you know, fast-tracking the destruction of the whole planet.
[01:45:04.018 --> 01:45:05.258]  Will that be enough?
[01:45:05.798 --> 01:45:06.619]  No, it won't be enough.
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.126]  We want to go beyond systems of exploitation and oppression altogether.
[01:45:11.466 --> 01:45:12.327]  But that's a process.
[01:45:12.808 --> 01:45:21.840]  And I think what's great about the movement that's beginning to emerge is that the crisis is so severe in terms of joblessness, violence, and now ecological threats.
[01:45:22.438 --> 01:45:24.199]  I don't know if you guys know Van Jones.
[01:45:24.239 --> 01:45:25.980]  Van Jones is... This is his house, apparently.
[01:45:50.086 --> 01:45:52.408]  Van Jones!
[01:45:53.329 --> 01:45:56.693]  Van Jones, we were so delighted to be able to recruit him into the White House.
[01:45:56.733 --> 01:46:07.063]  We've been watching him really for, he's not that old, but for as long as he's been active out in Oakland and all of the ways that he has, the creative ideas that he has, and so now we've captured that.
[01:46:07.123 --> 01:46:09.766]  That's the White House and him in the White House and them thanking him.
[01:46:10.186 --> 01:46:11.307]  The issue here is
[01:46:12.088 --> 01:46:14.670]  This is not communism or for the people, even if you believe in that.
[01:46:14.690 --> 01:46:21.335]  This is big banks openly say they're going to take over the whole economy and then those parasites you see are going to move into the middle class.
[01:46:21.375 --> 01:46:24.778]  Your houses, your land, your daughters are theirs, your kids are theirs.
[01:46:25.178 --> 01:46:34.746]  And coming up, we finish up with flu, I'm going to play Al Gore, I'm going to play Obama, I'm going to play them all saying, and Rahm Emanuel, kids report on your parents.
[01:46:35.166 --> 01:46:37.008]  Kids, don't do what your parents say.
[01:46:37.348 --> 01:46:39.310]  This is the most savage assault
[01:46:40.347 --> 01:46:48.178]  And now on giant telescreens, the President's going to start addressing your kids and telling them to literally come after you.
[01:46:48.739 --> 01:46:51.944]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've already got their goons beating people up everywhere.
[01:46:52.985 --> 01:46:54.988]  Our guest is Steve Quayle, SteveQuayle.com.
[01:46:55.088 --> 01:46:56.510]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:46:59.056 --> 01:47:08.045]  If you or your parents are 62 years of age or older and a homeowner, RMApply.com has a message that is vitally important for you and your family.

[01:47:53.814 --> 01:47:56.996]  That's 713-551-1155 today.
[01:47:57.156 --> 01:48:04.940]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:07.001]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:48:07.955 --> 01:48:08.976]  But who is the enemy?
[01:48:09.496 --> 01:48:09.997]  Bin Laden.
[01:48:10.297 --> 01:48:11.258]  This is his M.O.
[01:48:11.278 --> 01:48:12.639]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:48:12.659 --> 01:48:14.301]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:48:14.661 --> 01:48:21.407]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:48:21.807 --> 01:48:22.248]  Some U.S.
[01:48:22.288 --> 01:48:27.933]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:48:28.633 --> 01:48:32.115]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:48:32.135 --> 01:48:34.275]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:48:58.362 --> 01:49:03.845]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[01:49:04.326 --> 01:49:05.046]  Think about that.
[01:49:05.086 --> 01:49:07.748]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[01:49:08.208 --> 01:49:11.170]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:21.216]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious tasting, chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants.
[01:49:21.676 --> 01:49:27.241]  Unlike hard-to-digest pills, Choose for Health is a convenient chewable which allows for better digestion.
[01:49:27.501 --> 01:49:28.522]  The choice is yours.
[01:49:28.682 --> 01:49:33.946]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can better digest.
[01:49:34.287 --> 01:49:35.027]  Choose for Health.
[01:49:35.307 --> 01:49:39.091]  The world's first superfruit, sea vegetable, antioxidant chewable.
[01:49:39.351 --> 01:49:41.813]  Whole food nutrition, not rocks and shells.
[01:49:42.814 --> 01:49:44.015]  1-800-210-1922.

[01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:04.444]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:50:04.484 --> 01:50:05.004]  and the world.
[01:50:05.264 --> 01:50:08.726]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:50:09.126 --> 01:50:15.370]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:50:15.630 --> 01:50:17.412]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:50:17.652 --> 01:50:22.895]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[01:50:23.075 --> 01:50:25.638]  With double enamel cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:50:25.879 --> 01:50:30.304]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:50:30.585 --> 01:50:36.132]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[01:50:36.412 --> 01:50:38.415]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[01:50:38.575 --> 01:50:40.838]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[01:50:41.158 --> 01:50:41.938]  Free of charge.
[01:50:42.258 --> 01:50:42.559]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[01:50:42.579 --> 01:50:42.639]  1-800-453-2202.
[01:50:42.659 --> 01:50:44.959]  Or visit our website at ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[01:50:44.979 --> 01:50:47.020]  Factory direct, wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:47.720]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[01:51:09.147 --> 01:51:13.710]  Folks, they say there's no national compulsory service as they introduce the bills.
[01:51:15.071 --> 01:51:17.693]  They say there's no anti-gun bills as they introduce them.
[01:51:17.713 --> 01:51:20.055]  They say there's no FEMA camps as they're openly billed.
[01:51:21.416 --> 01:51:24.398]  This is a military tactic, and so is the incrementalism.
[01:51:26.019 --> 01:51:27.320]  And they admit they're doing it.
[01:51:28.655 --> 01:51:32.437]  And they admit they're coming out to talk radio and they want to have Chavez-style control.
[01:51:32.477 --> 01:51:34.338]  That's the head of the FCC diversity unit.
[01:51:34.958 --> 01:51:38.819]  It's time to say no in free speech at every level and every way.
[01:51:38.839 --> 01:51:45.262]  And if they shut down talk radio and shut down the internet, you've got to put posters up and you've got to put up micro-FM and AM.
[01:51:45.282 --> 01:51:46.403]  We've got to fight this tyranny.
[01:51:47.563 --> 01:51:53.186]  I mean, I'm calling for people to really gear up and get serious and to not back down from this tyranny.
[01:51:54.028 --> 01:51:55.109]  It's your First Amendment right.
[01:51:55.749 --> 01:51:56.930]  These people mean business.
[01:51:57.010 --> 01:51:58.971]  Every other country's been overrun and culled.
[01:51:59.751 --> 01:52:04.014]  Now it's happening to England and the United States and Canada and Australia.
[01:52:04.674 --> 01:52:08.056]  Our once great free countries are completely falling to classical despotism.
[01:52:08.417 --> 01:52:15.100]  You heard that wicked, wicked Van Jones admitting total redistribution, total communism.
[01:52:15.441 --> 01:52:16.461]  But that's not really what it is.
[01:52:16.521 --> 01:52:19.483]  It's the banks putting us all in slave camps.
[01:52:19.863 --> 01:52:20.884]  He is a slave master.
[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:26.340]  Steve Coyle, your comments on that?
[01:52:26.741 --> 01:52:28.721]  Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't want to interrupt you.
[01:52:28.741 --> 01:52:32.222]  Well, I think the thing is, I'm glad you played that clip, because here's the deal.
[01:52:32.843 --> 01:52:46.807]  When you've got someone that's a head of the Treasury who doesn't pay his income tax, and then you get an announcement that the IRS is going after delinquent taxpayers who have lost their jobs or basically had to forfeit their houses, this is the ultimate Hegelian dialectic.
[01:52:47.247 --> 01:52:52.009]  If Americans do not stand up with their free speech, and I've got to tell you, Alex, concurrent
[01:52:52.329 --> 01:52:53.370]  We're good to go.
[01:53:16.884 --> 01:53:20.307]  A president coming to address the school kids on debate?
[01:53:20.848 --> 01:53:22.709]  How dare he make his appeal?
[01:53:22.749 --> 01:53:25.192]  That's exactly what the Hitler Youth was based on.
[01:53:25.612 --> 01:53:30.056]  And ladies and gentlemen, they steal terms, reinvent the meaning, and then go after it.
[01:53:30.096 --> 01:53:41.606]  Like Alex, for instance, when they're claiming that anybody who believes in a conspiracy is in need of psychiatric help, it's the freaking psychiatrists that have screwed up more lives than they've solved.
[01:53:41.706 --> 01:53:43.628]  And I'm standing by that statement.
[01:53:44.048 --> 01:53:50.852]  If I sit on your show, they identify, they vilify, make you a villain, then they nullify to destroy.
[01:53:51.232 --> 01:54:00.518]  Ladies and gentlemen, the greatest takeover is not the physical, first of all, it's the spiritual, and it's followed by the financial.
[01:54:01.098 --> 01:54:11.825]  One, when you abdicate your God-given freedom and cease to speak out against evil, it's very soon the chains that you choose to ignore are those that
[01:54:12.305 --> 01:54:13.807]  Well, that's it about corruption.
[01:54:13.827 --> 01:54:23.198]  When you've studied history, and listen to what Steve Quill is telling you, when you study history, you begin to learn and realize that once you give in to corruption, it immediately races downhill.
[01:54:23.798 --> 01:54:25.000]  And that's what the founders said.
[01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:29.284]  They said the level of tyranny you will live under is the exact amount you will put up with.
[01:54:29.885 --> 01:54:30.386]  Absolutely.
[01:54:31.727 --> 01:54:34.430]  I know it's never really happened here, but it's happened everywhere else.
[01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:36.552]  This is real tyranny.
[01:54:36.892 --> 01:54:41.617]  This is line us up in pits and shoot us in the back of the head.
[01:54:41.897 --> 01:54:49.044]  This has put us in work brigades with little control freak dirt bags riding around on horses, the cattle prodding us.
[01:54:49.124 --> 01:54:50.085]  I'm sorry, Steve, go ahead.
[01:54:50.345 --> 01:55:00.153]  Well, first of all, I've been on record as telling the people in the military there's a war going on, even to the point of taking down four of America's heroes in a Blackhawk over Denver.
[01:55:00.194 --> 01:55:15.567]  Now, Alex, that's mainstream news, but what people don't understand is those brave men in the Blackhawk wouldn't go along with the plan to basically get rid of 25 to 50 million Americans, then jump to the Intelligence Committee, which I've been telling everybody behind the scenes.
[01:55:16.207 --> 01:55:19.409]  Based on the information coming to me that there's a war going on.
[01:55:19.749 --> 01:55:24.072]  And even to the point where someone in the former National Security Agency just a couple weeks ago...
[01:55:25.006 --> 01:55:32.472]  Quit, Alex, and now he's running for his life because he said, I will not be a part of the death of 25 to 50 million Americans.
[01:55:32.873 --> 01:55:33.653]  Now, look at this.
[01:55:34.214 --> 01:55:37.236]  People say, well, the economy is turning around, the economy is turning around.
[01:55:37.576 --> 01:55:44.022]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you watch the mainstream news, you are absolutely in the brain dead group already.
[01:55:44.442 --> 01:55:50.127]  You cannot think for yourselves because you are accepting the fact that someone will tell you what's going on.
[01:55:50.467 --> 01:56:05.295]  Instead of doing your homework to say, how can this be that the stock market is at record levels when unemployment is absolutely being multiplied, when we've got the situation where the Chinese basically said, to the American investment community, go to hell.
[01:56:05.595 --> 01:56:08.297]  Your financial instruments are total trash.
[01:56:08.577 --> 01:56:09.657]  Alex, do you know what that means?
[01:56:09.978 --> 01:56:11.819]  That means $1 quadrillion
[01:56:12.779 --> 01:56:13.019]  Steve!
[01:56:37.828 --> 01:56:38.569]  Steve, stay there.
[01:56:38.589 --> 01:56:41.450]  We're going to come right back to you after this quick break.
[01:56:42.171 --> 01:56:46.533]  I want to look at how you see this unfolding into the fall and winter.
[01:56:47.174 --> 01:56:48.895]  And do we have any effect on changing it?
[01:56:48.915 --> 01:56:49.695]  We're on the march.
[01:56:50.216 --> 01:56:51.797]  The empire's on the run.
[01:56:52.737 --> 01:56:55.419]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:57.853 --> 01:57:03.039]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:57:03.179 --> 01:57:07.524]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:57:07.704 --> 01:57:09.546]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:57:09.967 --> 01:57:11.348]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:57:11.609 --> 01:57:12.630]  There is a solution.
[01:57:12.870 --> 01:57:20.893]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:57:21.274 --> 01:57:28.356]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:57:28.737 --> 01:57:34.399]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:57:34.779 --> 01:57:40.364]  I love their Nutri Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:57:40.784 --> 01:57:44.608]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:57:44.948 --> 01:57:49.312]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.
[01:57:49.332 --> 01:57:51.154]  866-762-9238.
[01:57:52.415 --> 01:57:55.718]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:57:58.046 --> 01:58:03.049]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:58:03.269 --> 01:58:07.052]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:07.292 --> 01:58:12.895]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:58:13.195 --> 01:58:13.636]  It's true.
[01:58:13.836 --> 01:58:18.058]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:58:18.259 --> 01:58:18.759]  Number three,
[01:58:19.159 --> 01:58:24.622]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:58:25.463 --> 01:58:28.104]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:58:28.365 --> 01:58:31.767]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:58:32.867 --> 01:58:36.510]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:58:36.730 --> 01:58:42.233]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:58:42.473 --> 01:58:45.455]  You can get more information at www.solutionsfromscience.com.
[01:58:45.635 --> 01:58:47.017]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:58:47.158 --> 01:58:48.700]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:51.244]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[01:58:51.504 --> 01:58:54.128]  So go to MySolarBackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[01:58:58.516 --> 01:59:05.343]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[01:59:05.643 --> 01:59:21.558]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[01:59:21.858 --> 01:59:27.000]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:33.502]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[01:59:33.722 --> 01:59:37.364]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[01:59:37.624 --> 01:59:40.205]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[01:59:40.305 --> 01:59:45.667]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[01:59:45.987 --> 01:59:48.589]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:59:48.669 --> 01:59:50.850]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:59:50.891 --> 01:59:53.332]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:59:53.392 --> 01:59:57.755]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[02:00:05.881 --> 02:00:09.083]  We're going to continue with Steve Quayle five minutes into the next hour.
[02:00:10.219 --> 02:00:25.366]  Then for 20-30 minutes or so, we have Chuck Baldwin's running mate who was at the MIAC report hearings in Missouri about the feds making local police secret police, listing gun owners, veterans, Ron Paul supporters, libertarians, Christians as terrorists, period.
[02:00:25.906 --> 02:00:26.727]  So that's coming up.
[02:00:27.627 --> 02:00:30.709]  Then we've got the lady out of Lubbock suing Obama.
[02:00:31.903 --> 02:00:36.987]  Over using the fake name Barack Obama when it's very Sotero on his passport.
[02:00:37.588 --> 02:00:40.850]  So whether he was born in Kenya or not, the issue is he's got a fake name.
[02:00:41.110 --> 02:00:42.511]  This guy's a total mystery man.
[02:00:42.752 --> 02:00:45.774]  We're going back to Steve Quayle to break down how he sees things unfolding.
[02:00:46.114 --> 02:00:53.220]  And if, in his expert opinion, I really respect Steve, he thinks we have ways of changing this or having another outcome.
[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:54.401]  I think we do.
[02:00:54.801 --> 02:00:58.284]  But I'm not sure about that or I want his take on it.
[02:00:58.324 --> 02:01:00.706]  But for the next three minutes, I drug Ted Anderson in here.
[02:01:01.874 --> 02:01:04.296]  Ted Anderson bought a bunch of gold and silver when it was $905, $911, $915, $920.
[02:01:04.476 --> 02:01:06.257]  And he's got different groups at different prices.
[02:01:06.277 --> 02:01:07.017]  Gold is at $993 plus today.
[02:01:07.037 --> 02:01:08.298]  Gold is up.
[02:01:25.285 --> 02:01:29.108]  Just a massive amount today.
[02:01:29.188 --> 02:01:32.031]  Gold is up over $13.60 today.
[02:01:32.751 --> 02:01:35.013]  It's up over $50 in the last week.
[02:01:35.613 --> 02:01:44.381]  It is pushing $1,000, and that's... Steve was starting to talk about, well, we'll get Steve to take it, but Ted goes on this, because Steve's also a big researcher on the economy for years and a big supporter of gold.
[02:01:46.943 --> 02:01:49.664]  But a lot of things are happening with the economy right now.
[02:01:49.804 --> 02:01:52.585]  The dollar is doing strange things.
[02:01:52.605 --> 02:01:54.166]  The economy's doing strange things.
[02:01:54.206 --> 02:01:55.886]  The media's saying everything's wonderful.
[02:01:56.547 --> 02:02:00.588]  They wanted to fearmonger to get you to give up all your liberties and freedoms and accept the Bank of the World.
[02:02:00.928 --> 02:02:10.712]  But things are deteriorating so fast, now they're telling you everything's great, but Main Street is contracting while they dump trillions into the stock market, which is now starting inflation going.
[02:02:11.252 --> 02:02:12.433]  That was on the news today.
[02:02:12.733 --> 02:02:17.416]  So I want to bring Ted Anderson up from Midas Resources because he can't hold this much longer.
[02:02:17.476 --> 02:02:28.642]  Ted, tell folks why we see gold exploding 30 years in the business, Midas Resources, and then tell them about the gold and silver you've got at the super lower prices than the market is now.
[02:02:29.383 --> 02:02:33.064]  Well, the bottom line is the world market does not want to have U.S.
[02:02:33.144 --> 02:02:37.166]  dollars as the main exchange for currency across the globe.
[02:02:37.526 --> 02:02:39.267]  They're trying to get away from that factor.
[02:02:39.707 --> 02:02:42.188]  The United States is printing money like crazy.
[02:02:42.228 --> 02:02:47.210]  The TARP money and everything that's gone into the bailouts, that's why you're seeing gold and silver go up.
[02:02:47.530 --> 02:02:52.652]  The velocity of that money is entering into the marketplace and pushing up commodity prices.
[02:02:53.172 --> 02:02:56.835]  Right now, gold is just peaking at $1,000 an ounce.
[02:02:57.135 --> 02:03:06.782]  Alex, the only reason why I didn't change my prices today is not because I have the inventory so much anymore, it's because I haven't had time to catch up to what's going on in the marketplace.
[02:03:06.822 --> 02:03:08.083]  It's going crazy right now.
[02:03:08.483 --> 02:03:11.685]  So, I have my prices still posted at yesterday's prices.
[02:03:12.066 --> 02:03:16.569]  I won't have it like this tomorrow, unless if gold takes a big dive, and I doubt that'll happen.
[02:03:17.089 --> 02:03:20.170]  But we are sitting right now with those Lakota coins at $19.70.
[02:03:20.690 --> 02:03:28.212]  Silver was close to, what, $13.50 when I put them there, and it's over $15 an ounce.
[02:03:28.572 --> 02:03:29.392]  And we have gold.
[02:03:29.592 --> 02:03:31.493]  The francs right now are $2.16.
[02:03:31.533 --> 02:03:35.934]  I mean, that's down when gold was about $9.20, and now gold is sitting at $1,000.
[02:03:37.094 --> 02:03:37.435]  Thank you.
[02:03:53.311 --> 02:03:57.256]  Now explain to people the different levels on the different gold and silver offers briefly, Ted.
[02:03:57.497 --> 02:04:00.761]  The different levels you bought in at, and then you're passing those savings on.
[02:04:00.781 --> 02:04:03.385]  You're not raising prices like all the other gold and silver brokers.
[02:04:03.685 --> 02:04:05.287]  You've got it on hand right now.
[02:04:06.068 --> 02:04:07.850]  At prices they can't get it anywhere else.
[02:04:08.251 --> 02:04:17.297]  Well, that's the reason why I'm saying that, Alex, is because of the fact that I have been buying into the dips, and we've seen $9.45, we've seen $9.13, we've seen $9.16.
[02:04:17.617 --> 02:04:19.838]  And when I see that coming around, I do buy.
[02:04:19.879 --> 02:04:26.523]  I try to get in contact with any wholesalers that I have, or anybody that has supply, and I try to buy as much as I can.
[02:04:26.943 --> 02:04:34.308]  Just due to the fact, I mean, most normal circumstances, you wouldn't do this, but I just know that gold will come back around every time they beat it up.
[02:04:34.768 --> 02:04:43.420]  I get in there and I buy, because it only makes sense to me that it's going to come back around again, because we haven't solved the financial problems of this country, certainly not yet.
[02:04:43.860 --> 02:04:45.943]  And right now is a great opportunity to be getting in.
[02:04:46.224 --> 02:04:52.192]  Plus also I can say, surely, without a question, like for instance, just take that Lakota coin for example.
[02:04:52.632 --> 02:04:56.975]  The last time I priced it, I would have to put them at $20.40.
[02:04:58.116 --> 02:05:05.822]  If, indeed, I just price it off where silver is right now, just take, let's call it $15.50 an ounce, that's going to put that closer to $21.50.
[02:05:05.862 --> 02:05:07.223]  That's what the market has done.
[02:05:07.243 --> 02:05:08.243]  You're using technical terms.
[02:05:08.264 --> 02:05:09.725]  Per ounce, you bought gold at what?
[02:05:18.447 --> 02:05:28.732]  Yeah, well the gold that I picked up, it was around that $9.11 to $9.16 level when I was picking up Franks and selling them for that $216 level in the British Sovereign Reserve.
[02:05:28.772 --> 02:05:32.594]  So most of this gold was bought at the $9.15, $9.16.
[02:05:33.075 --> 02:05:37.857]  You're selling it with that factored in at the $9.92 plus level.
[02:05:38.137 --> 02:05:40.158]  Folks, give Ted Anderson, Minus Resources, a call.
[02:05:40.178 --> 02:05:41.479]  They'll be there until midnight tonight.
[02:05:41.499 --> 02:05:41.639]  800-686-2237.
[02:05:41.659 --> 02:05:41.699]  800-686-2237.
[02:05:47.362 --> 02:05:47.682]  I think?
[02:06:09.253 --> 02:06:10.394]  80-something bucks cheaper.
[02:06:11.135 --> 02:06:14.517]  So again, 800-686-2237.
[02:06:14.557 --> 02:06:17.820]  Ted Anderson, thank you so much for popping in with us.
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:19.221]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:06:19.401 --> 02:06:19.781]  You bet.
[02:06:19.841 --> 02:06:23.324]  Steve, I apologize for making you hold for the last four minutes, but I know that's important.
[02:06:23.344 --> 02:06:25.866]  You were getting into the economy, but we went to break.
[02:06:25.886 --> 02:06:31.530]  I wanted to get into flu and the overall picture, how you see this unfolding and how we can hopefully stop it.
[02:06:31.931 --> 02:06:32.971]  Any chances we've got of that?
[02:06:33.012 --> 02:06:36.034]  But briefly, gold, what's your view on what's happening with the economy?
[02:06:36.482 --> 02:06:44.270]  Well, the bottom line is it's the engineered collapse of the Western banking system, and again, to all the pundits who said it would never happen, it's happening.
[02:06:44.790 --> 02:06:51.978]  And the situation is, again, Alex, to put it into perspective, the Chinese have just stated who owns the most U.S.
[02:06:52.078 --> 02:06:54.560]  dollar foreign reserves is China.
[02:06:54.620 --> 02:07:00.106]  China's taken those reserves and is buying all the natural resources around the world, rightly so.
[02:07:00.766 --> 02:07:16.479]  At least one thing people ought to understand about the Asian mentality, even in that world of China and Hong Kong, etc., is you still have a certain honor amongst those who trade on an international basis.
[02:07:16.559 --> 02:07:17.420]  When the United States
[02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:18.681]  We're good to go.
[02:07:40.817 --> 02:07:44.219]  Look, the international discount on dollars is already up, I'm told, to 40%.
[02:07:44.519 --> 02:07:47.461]  In other words, if you want to dump a billion U.S.
[02:07:47.521 --> 02:07:50.382]  dollars for something else, you're going to take a 40% hit.
[02:07:50.883 --> 02:08:00.168]  Most of the money, if not all the money, that was gone into the TARP program and everything else to bail out the banks, listen, the middle class is being destroyed.
[02:08:00.468 --> 02:08:01.468]  Let me make it simple.
[02:08:01.689 --> 02:08:03.069]  Basic economics 101.
[02:08:03.630 --> 02:08:09.333]  If you don't have a job and don't have money, you can't buy a house and you can't have any fun.
[02:08:09.773 --> 02:08:11.154]  You can't go recreating.
[02:08:11.174 --> 02:08:11.994]  You can't do anything.
[02:08:12.014 --> 02:08:16.096]  That's why the hotels are crashing.
[02:08:16.116 --> 02:08:17.237]  They're going into receivership.
[02:08:17.617 --> 02:08:18.297]  Restaurants.
[02:08:18.738 --> 02:08:20.839]  Everybody is running out of cash.
[02:08:20.899 --> 02:08:25.321]  And even Cerebus, one of the biggest hedge funds, just denied access to the funds.
[02:08:25.381 --> 02:08:32.384]  I've been telling people, if you have an IRA, TO, 401K, any of those defined benefit plans, you're going to be locked out of them.
[02:08:32.444 --> 02:08:36.026]  And today, one of the stories that posted on my website, stevequayle.com,
[02:08:38.107 --> 02:08:41.573]  Is the fact that different hedge funds don't have the money.
[02:08:41.933 --> 02:08:42.835]  Real simple, Alex.
[02:08:42.895 --> 02:08:45.218]  Here's the easiest thing to tell everybody.
[02:08:45.699 --> 02:08:50.647]  Every single bit of capital in the United States has been pledged or stolen.
[02:08:51.989 --> 02:08:53.409]  Pledged or stolen.
[02:08:53.710 --> 02:09:01.512]  And all we're doing is creating more debt, monetizing the debt, and then slumping the responsibility for the debt off on the taxpayer.
[02:09:01.832 --> 02:09:03.333]  They're spending like there is no end.
[02:09:03.353 --> 02:09:03.933]  So what do we have?
[02:09:03.973 --> 02:09:09.054]  We have the Amaro, or we jump into an Asian-backed commodity basket of currencies.
[02:09:09.434 --> 02:09:16.217]  Brazil, Russia, India, China could come up with a brick basket of currencies with a partial commodity backing.
[02:09:16.537 --> 02:09:17.237]  But here's the deal.
[02:09:18.057 --> 02:09:24.198]  There's a famous statement that money and gold go from weak hands to strong hands.
[02:09:24.578 --> 02:09:27.279]  And the strongest guys on the block right now are the Chinese.
[02:09:27.319 --> 02:09:28.939]  Jimmy Rogers has warned about it.
[02:09:29.419 --> 02:09:31.780]  A lot of us have been warning about it for 15 years.
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:38.521]  But when you're ahead of time, no one believes you until the time, and when the time comes that they're seeing with their own eyes, you know how they respond?
[02:09:38.761 --> 02:09:39.662]  They deny it.
[02:09:40.082 --> 02:09:40.762]  They deny it.
[02:09:40.822 --> 02:09:44.123]  But they can't deny when they don't have anything in their checking account.
[02:09:44.223 --> 02:09:45.883]  Alex, when this thing goes down,
[02:09:46.403 --> 02:09:47.164]  And there will be.
[02:09:47.344 --> 02:09:55.833]  I have in my possession the letters that have been initiated by a specific bank holding company to inform their clients.
[02:09:55.853 --> 02:09:58.075]  This is not internet bull, but you know what?
[02:09:59.176 --> 02:10:03.540]  Basically, everyone will be given a certain amount of money to withdraw from their account.
[02:10:03.841 --> 02:10:06.443]  They quote an executive order that's already been signed.
[02:10:06.944 --> 02:10:09.066]  All safety deposit boxes will be seized.
[02:10:09.146 --> 02:10:10.047]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:10:10.487 --> 02:10:19.537]  This is coming, and just because it didn't happen on the 26th, I can tell you point-blank that they are getting ready to tank the economy, the international bankers.
[02:10:19.557 --> 02:10:24.222]  300 million Americans have been raped, pillaged, and plundered.
[02:10:24.262 --> 02:10:27.705]  Now they're going to go to India and China and do the same thing there.
[02:10:27.725 --> 02:10:30.969]  But the Chinese are onto their game, and they're not going to buy into it.
[02:10:33.331 --> 02:10:35.932]  Steve Quayle, is there a way to avert this?
[02:10:37.392 --> 02:10:47.015]  Walk through your view of what's going to happen with the flu, how they could use that as a cover for their overall economic collapse, and to roll out their military forces.
[02:10:47.395 --> 02:10:49.476]  Well, I think, Alex, you've just said it.
[02:10:49.716 --> 02:10:51.437]  It's all going down at the same time.
[02:10:51.557 --> 02:10:53.077]  Too many people think of linear.
[02:10:53.117 --> 02:10:58.459]  When you read the writing on a basketball or baseball, it goes over the entire surface of the ball.
[02:10:58.899 --> 02:10:59.859]  I think we're good to go.
[02:11:24.186 --> 02:11:27.188]  Bioweaponers, that's the one they also are worried about.
[02:11:27.228 --> 02:11:37.033]  That's why all the scientists, I know you had a show on or mentioned my list of dead scientists, they were dead because they either worked on it or could have said to everybody, hey wait a minute, this is genetically altered.
[02:11:37.373 --> 02:11:38.994]  So the thing is, is that it's happening.
[02:11:39.034 --> 02:11:47.058]  There's a story on the BBC, it's on my front side of my news site today, stevequayle.com, Alex, that we're all being mutated, okay?
[02:11:47.178 --> 02:11:47.699]  Mutated.
[02:11:47.979 --> 02:11:50.380]  In other words, all of the environmental toxins,
[02:11:50.740 --> 02:11:55.263]  All the food toxins, all the genetically altered binders that are being put in.
[02:11:55.323 --> 02:12:01.347]  First of all, the thing that I want to say is this, is that we can stand against this thing, but we cannot stop it.
[02:12:01.388 --> 02:12:07.632]  Because again, my, and here's where you and I will differ, we are in a period unlike any other period in the history of time.
[02:12:08.032 --> 02:12:19.260]  It's not the end of the world, but it is that time when the New World Order, and Alex, I think you just said it about 30 minutes ago, you've spoken against it so many times, and you've done a fabulous job.
[02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:34.367]  But when it's here, it is here with such a ferocity in your face, but the thing that hurts, I don't know if it hurts you, it breaks my heart that people who should have been fighting it instead of fighting us, now they're in deep doo-doo, okay?
[02:12:34.687 --> 02:12:37.228]  Because there's nothing that's going to pull them out.
[02:12:37.348 --> 02:12:46.372]  In essence, unless America repents, and this is my final statement on this, on the order of Nineveh, our days are numbered.
[02:12:47.973 --> 02:12:50.414]  Let's talk about the other thing the Chinese did in the economy.
[02:12:50.434 --> 02:12:51.715]  This is critical, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:12:52.095 --> 02:12:56.458]  Hong Kong has demanded London return their gold to Hong Kong for safekeeping.
[02:12:57.178 --> 02:12:58.839]  Saudi Arabia has done the same thing.
[02:12:58.919 --> 02:12:59.479]  Guess what?
[02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:10.926]  With all the funny business in the Bank of England and all of the different bank holding companies and gold holding banks in London, they're going to be hard-pressed to be able to produce it.
[02:13:11.066 --> 02:13:11.947]  So guess what?
[02:13:12.387 --> 02:13:13.748]  Once that is found out,
[02:13:14.088 --> 02:13:15.829]  The price of the metal should explode.
[02:13:15.949 --> 02:13:19.210]  It doesn't surprise me if they try and hit gold $100 from the high.
[02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:22.752]  We may see $1,000, $1,500, $1,100, then it'll go down a week.
[02:13:23.092 --> 02:13:27.434]  But the next time it's going into Martin Armstrong's numbers and he's talking $5,000 gold.
[02:13:27.834 --> 02:13:37.698]  The point is, is that those who trusted the system, they were like the willing accomplices to a massive gang rape.
[02:13:38.058 --> 02:13:39.499]  But Steve, I want to go back.
[02:13:39.519 --> 02:13:40.279]  I want to go back to flu.
[02:13:40.299 --> 02:13:43.220]  I've been reading where they say it's a DNA therapy.
[02:13:43.260 --> 02:13:44.721]  One of the five vaccines that changes our DNA.
[02:13:44.741 --> 02:13:45.541]  That isn't a vaccine.
[02:13:45.561 --> 02:13:46.842]  That's some type of weird mutagen.
[02:14:06.991 --> 02:14:08.812]  It's monster-making, Alex.
[02:14:09.052 --> 02:14:15.734]  Look, they're also putting in, ladies and gentlemen, remember when we were sold the horse manure and your governor went along with it on Gardasil?
[02:14:15.754 --> 02:14:18.294]  Do you know how many people are dying of Gardasil?
[02:14:18.694 --> 02:14:21.535]  They're also putting in birth control.
[02:14:21.895 --> 02:14:23.036]  It is eugenic.
[02:14:23.116 --> 02:14:25.276]  It is genetic sterilization.
[02:14:25.636 --> 02:14:30.898]  The entire human genome that is responsible for reproduction is being tampered.
[02:14:30.918 --> 02:14:34.039]  So when the BBC says, you know, that 70-80 mutagenic
[02:14:35.259 --> 02:14:35.659]  I think so.
[02:14:51.008 --> 02:15:02.776]  And in his image and likeness, the devil wants to destroy that image and likeness and reproduce, if you will, a civilization, a population of cyborgs and mutants.
[02:15:03.176 --> 02:15:07.158]  And that's why the Human Genome Project was funded in its entirety.
[02:15:07.479 --> 02:15:12.382]  That's why all the secret government block projects, and I know you don't like to talk about some of that.
[02:15:12.402 --> 02:15:15.724]  No, no, no, but as crazy as it sounds, all these top
[02:15:17.202 --> 02:15:29.617]  Bioethicists, all these top futurists, Ray Kurzweil, they all say that, that they're going to merge with machines, and then the elite's going to get rid of all the rest of us, and they really do believe this.
[02:15:30.179 --> 02:15:33.640]  Well, yeah, they're like Terminators with retro rockets, okay?
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:43.762]  The bottom line is that, look, I wrote the book, Genetic Armageddon, and people just even, and again, I say this because if the Christians were the salt of the earth, okay?
[02:15:44.082 --> 02:15:59.046]  Look, Alex, you have done, and I say this not in a flattering way, but in a way of recognizing what you have done with all your movies and laid it out, videos laid it out, all your appearances, everything you've done, all your radio interviews, all the people you've interviewed, you've laid it out for everybody,
[02:15:59.206 --> 02:16:07.891]  But isn't it fascinating that having done all that, that still the anesthetizing of the American public is so strong?
[02:16:08.331 --> 02:16:10.153]  And you say, okay, how can that be?
[02:16:10.173 --> 02:16:11.393]  Well, it's real simple.
[02:16:11.713 --> 02:16:24.001]  Because ladies and gentlemen, they are controlling everything you see, everything you hear, everything you think about, everything you feel about, and they're doing it in a masterful way.
[02:16:24.481 --> 02:16:27.623]  Trillions of dollars have been spent on mind control.
[02:16:27.663 --> 02:16:30.024]  Not just MKUltra and the stuff you talked about, Alex.
[02:16:30.444 --> 02:16:33.886]  But there are so many dark projects, black budgets.
[02:16:34.246 --> 02:16:40.469]  And so, ladies and gentlemen, in the name of Jesus, those of you who are called to be Christians, you must stand up.
[02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:42.550]  And Alex, you asked me the bottom line question.
[02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:43.511]  We are.
[02:16:43.531 --> 02:16:46.413]  You called your video End Game, okay?
[02:16:46.813 --> 02:16:48.354]  And we are in the End Times.
[02:16:48.735 --> 02:16:55.160]  And whether people believe in the Book of Revelation, or... And I say to people, how could I have been right all these years?
[02:16:55.620 --> 02:17:04.347]  And I'm saying that, and contrary to my critics, so far ahead of time, my worldview was given to me by the Living God to warn His people, okay?
[02:17:04.767 --> 02:17:09.010]  And a warning is only as effective as people pay attention to it.
[02:17:09.090 --> 02:17:09.891]  Your videos
[02:17:10.271 --> 02:17:19.459]  And as things get scarier and scarier, well I was doing some consulting for Jesse Ventura for his new TV show and I was doing research as they wanted stuff about
[02:17:36.661 --> 02:17:37.683]  Mind Control Towers.
[02:17:52.475 --> 02:17:57.642]  That DARPA is already testing different frequency systems to calm the public.
[02:17:58.022 --> 02:17:58.623]  Mainstream news.
[02:17:58.643 --> 02:18:07.334]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.
[02:18:07.574 --> 02:18:09.937]  For 15 years, people have trusted AlkaZone.
[02:18:09.957 --> 02:18:17.161]  AlkaZone, the simplest way of keeping the body in pH balance, getting rid of acidic waste buildup, and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.

[02:18:58.268 --> 02:18:59.950]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[02:19:00.271 --> 02:19:03.715]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:19:03.896 --> 02:19:05.758]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:19:06.359 --> 02:19:09.123]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:19:09.423 --> 02:19:13.148]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding.
[02:19:13.148 --> 02:19:13.528]  We're good.
[02:19:43.168 --> 02:19:43.388]  We're good.
[02:19:58.675 --> 02:19:59.215]  You worry.
[02:19:59.355 --> 02:20:01.436]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[02:20:01.716 --> 02:20:01.997]  Hi.
[02:20:02.257 --> 02:20:04.738]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[02:20:05.038 --> 02:20:09.300]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[02:20:09.600 --> 02:20:11.781]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[02:20:12.061 --> 02:20:15.123]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[02:20:15.403 --> 02:20:17.124]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[02:20:17.344 --> 02:20:19.865]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[02:20:20.125 --> 02:20:23.547]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[02:20:23.847 --> 02:20:27.889]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[02:20:28.249 --> 02:20:32.050]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[02:20:32.350 --> 02:20:38.352]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[02:20:38.692 --> 02:20:40.833]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[02:20:41.033 --> 02:20:42.714]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[02:20:43.154 --> 02:20:47.355]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:20:47.815 --> 02:20:48.456]  Start now.
[02:20:48.716 --> 02:20:49.676]  Knowledge is power.
[02:20:50.436 --> 02:20:51.237]  Better take action.
[02:20:51.437 --> 02:20:52.397]  I think a storm's coming.
[02:21:01.665 --> 02:21:03.346]  The Globalists stage 9-11.
[02:21:03.867 --> 02:21:08.592]  They have engaged in eugenics in Africa, killing at least 50 million people with HIV alone.
[02:21:09.913 --> 02:21:15.178]  They have been caught nerve gassing foster children, our own troops, all declassified.
[02:21:16.738 --> 02:21:20.360]  Cancer virus is in the vaccine, so I won't put anything past them.
[02:21:20.841 --> 02:21:28.346]  We've never seen a massive military-police-state buildup like we've seen before April and the first flu fear-mongering began.
[02:21:28.786 --> 02:21:32.869]  They used that as their cover to get more stuff in position, because they couldn't keep it secret.
[02:21:34.381 --> 02:21:38.025]  I hope if we get the word out, speak out, warn people, they won't go for broke.
[02:21:38.545 --> 02:21:45.912]  Obama demanding the kids, you know, go in and start getting orders from him on big plasma screen TVs in sports stadiums.
[02:21:46.373 --> 02:21:47.954]  I mean, right out of 1984.
[02:21:51.518 --> 02:21:53.580]  I mean, this is really happening.
[02:21:54.679 --> 02:22:00.904]  And then Major George Soros funded publications like Media Matters saying, I'm a liar, none of this is happening, as they announce it.
[02:22:01.184 --> 02:22:02.465]  That's a military operation.
[02:22:02.585 --> 02:22:05.247]  As they're attacking their broadcasting, we're not attacking.
[02:22:05.928 --> 02:22:08.790]  I mean, that is a military operation right there.
[02:22:09.731 --> 02:22:14.894]  That's when you know they're going for broke, when they just start lying, knowing it's going to blow their cover with a lot of people.
[02:22:15.555 --> 02:22:20.419]  They don't care because they got missiles locked onto the Republic, and they're now going for broke.
[02:22:20.799 --> 02:22:22.780]  I'm seeing every indicator they're going for broke.
[02:22:23.721 --> 02:22:33.329]  If we get the word out, we may get a reprieve, or it may lessen whenever they pull, but it's almost like as we awaken to them, that just almost more ensures they're going for broke.
[02:22:34.470 --> 02:22:35.471]  It's just so incredible.
[02:22:35.611 --> 02:22:39.134]  So, Steve, what's the time frame then?
[02:22:39.454 --> 02:22:41.416]  Because they've backed the fear-mongering back.
[02:22:41.716 --> 02:22:45.439]  They were saying September, the government was saying they were going to start the forced inoculations.
[02:22:45.479 --> 02:22:47.020]  Now they're saying late October, November.
[02:22:47.340 --> 02:22:50.283]  Why are they moving the timetable back, or is that a ruse?
[02:22:51.007 --> 02:22:54.910]  I don't believe it's a ruse, but I call it moments of mercy, and I'm serious about that.
[02:22:54.990 --> 02:23:05.819]  Number one, you know, the Bible indicates, and look, I know you get a lot of flak when I talk about this, Alex, but tonight I wanted you to understand, I'm having Romy, my intercessor, come on my show.
[02:23:06.339 --> 02:23:09.962]  She's normally going to be on on Thursday at my five o'clock mountain.
[02:23:11.864 --> 02:23:15.327]  I'm going to ask her to pray for you and your family as well as others.
[02:23:15.928 --> 02:23:17.209]  I'm serious about this, Alex.
[02:23:17.570 --> 02:23:22.836]  The deal is that God has always moved in response to faith.
[02:23:23.476 --> 02:23:24.417]  Even Abraham.
[02:23:24.818 --> 02:23:27.601]  Could there have been any righteous people found in Abraham?
[02:23:28.141 --> 02:23:32.044]  Sodom and Gomorrah, the hand of the Lord would have been stayed, but here's what I want to make clear to everyone.
[02:23:32.545 --> 02:23:36.508]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot murder the babies that you've murdered.
[02:23:36.608 --> 02:23:38.649]  Now we get the government we deserve.
[02:23:39.050 --> 02:23:43.113]  We kicked Jesus out of the schoolrooms, now we got Obama in the schoolrooms.
[02:23:43.513 --> 02:23:48.275]  We've got every Christian symbol covered up by every presentation of Obama.
[02:23:49.456 --> 02:23:54.198]  I don't know who that lady is in Lubbock, but if any of you know her, give her a hug for me.
[02:23:54.598 --> 02:24:02.402]  Because ladies and gentlemen, when you reject truth and the ultimate source of truth, all you're left with is lies building upon lies.
[02:24:02.462 --> 02:24:03.943]  And Alex, what we're doing, okay?
[02:24:04.323 --> 02:24:06.964]  We can't stop it, but we can by time.
[02:24:07.024 --> 02:24:09.986]  We can by moments of mercy, by interceding.
[02:24:10.486 --> 02:24:11.127]  We're good to go.
[02:24:30.706 --> 02:24:31.947]  We're good to go.
[02:24:49.815 --> 02:24:54.236]  You speak not out against evil, you are basically siding with evil.
[02:24:54.497 --> 02:25:14.023]  And I gotta tell you this, 90% of the evangelical church, everyone that gets together on Sunday, doesn't understand that they sit peacefully, listening to some guy behind the pulpit, and everybody out there in the world of Luciferians is plotting their death, their destruction, and their annihilation.
[02:25:14.639 --> 02:25:19.200]  Well, we know that it's an info war, a war on for your mind, a war on for your soul.
[02:25:19.260 --> 02:25:20.660]  They're trafficking the souls of men.
[02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:23.121]  And the globalists are into the occult.
[02:25:24.141 --> 02:25:30.262]  And it's, it's, it's, this is Hitlerian, Stalinist, all rolled into one that we're facing.
[02:25:30.643 --> 02:25:33.163]  They're clearly moving on every front.
[02:25:33.583 --> 02:25:34.283]  This is it.
[02:25:34.343 --> 02:25:35.764]  This could be the big one.
[02:25:35.864 --> 02:25:36.424]  Stay with us.
[02:25:40.285 --> 02:25:41.285]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:25:42.759 --> 02:25:45.140]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:25:48.242 --> 02:25:50.863]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:25:51.263 --> 02:25:56.246]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:25:56.586 --> 02:25:58.327]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:25:58.647 --> 02:26:03.469]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:26:03.649 --> 02:26:04.570]  How much do you want?
[02:26:04.810 --> 02:26:05.571]  When do you want it?
[02:26:05.952 --> 02:26:07.534]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:26:07.834 --> 02:26:08.655]  When will you need it?
[02:26:08.916 --> 02:26:10.978]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:26:11.098 --> 02:26:12.220]  Will there be any food?
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:13.782]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:26:13.982 --> 02:26:19.049]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:26:19.249 --> 02:26:22.374]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:26:22.814 --> 02:26:26.318]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:26:26.638 --> 02:26:27.619]  How much will you need?
[02:26:27.859 --> 02:26:28.480]  We don't know.
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:29.681]  How much do you want?
[02:26:29.881 --> 02:26:30.602]  All you can get.
[02:26:30.802 --> 02:26:31.643]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:26:31.903 --> 02:26:34.666]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:26:34.946 --> 02:26:36.708]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:26:36.728 --> 02:26:37.649]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:26:50.692 --> 02:26:52.597]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:26:53.078 --> 02:26:55.864]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:27:12.113 --> 02:27:13.654]  We are back live.
[02:27:13.674 --> 02:27:15.435]  We lost Steve's line.
[02:27:15.515 --> 02:27:16.756]  We're trying to get him back on.
[02:27:16.896 --> 02:27:33.128]  And we're going to continue our discussion of the whole secret police system being set up with Chuck Baldwin's running mate, the Constitution Party, who was at one of the investigative committee meetings in Missouri with Representative Guest, who we had on yesterday.
[02:27:33.148 --> 02:27:34.249]  So that's coming up.
[02:27:34.409 --> 02:27:38.752]  I do want to tell you about one of the sponsors of the show that's made this radio show possible today.
[02:27:40.031 --> 02:27:41.852]  That's new silver solution.
[02:27:42.272 --> 02:27:45.333]  People all over the world are discovering the benefits of supernatural silver.
[02:27:45.353 --> 02:27:50.494]  It's just super nano-sized ployle silver.
[02:27:51.094 --> 02:27:56.796]  This powerful new nanotechnology is a natural antibiotic and preventative against infectious germs and disease.
[02:27:57.236 --> 02:28:00.957]  Silver is one of the oldest natural antibiotics and it's non-toxic.
[02:28:01.257 --> 02:28:06.079]  We've had medical doctors on that say it's really great for virus and bacteria.
[02:28:07.519 --> 02:28:09.000]  Visit their link on InfoWars.com.
[02:28:10.526 --> 02:28:10.786]  Let's do it!
[02:28:41.686 --> 02:28:47.609]  Look, in my experience the globalists will back off with an operation if we expose it.
[02:28:48.429 --> 02:28:59.374]  But I keep telling people it's in the executive orders for quarantines, it's in the executive orders to lock down cities, it's in the executive orders to have forced inoculations under a level 6.
[02:28:59.554 --> 02:29:06.817]  And I told you in April we were under level 6 because I had the state documents from the state of Texas health authorities meeting with the feds.
[02:29:07.477 --> 02:29:09.658]  I gave you documents with names and phone numbers on it.
[02:29:11.018 --> 02:29:13.659]  And then the media responded saying, saying what document?
[02:29:14.179 --> 02:29:16.080]  So we have that information.
[02:29:17.701 --> 02:29:23.123]  So they're definitely planning on this, though it seems like the public isn't buying into it.
[02:29:23.583 --> 02:29:26.744]  So, Steve, in closing, we lost your line.
[02:29:26.984 --> 02:29:33.587]  Steve Quell dot com, really appreciate you having the courage to talk about this and to come on the show and all your years of work.
[02:29:33.847 --> 02:29:35.348]  The last two minutes we have left with you, sir.
[02:29:36.186 --> 02:29:37.667]  Okay, Alex, here's what's going on.
[02:29:38.007 --> 02:29:50.816]  We're getting all kinds of reports from behind the scenes in the deep pool that the Gwinn Towers that have been operational for some time, you and I have talked about them over the years, not only can they be used to calm people, but in fact they can be used to cause agitation.
[02:29:50.936 --> 02:29:54.999]  In other words, in order to spark the Civil War, the Illuminati crave.
[02:29:55.019 --> 02:29:57.841]  Now, they want a massive blood sacrifice.
[02:29:57.881 --> 02:29:59.322]  You have documented through your
[02:30:00.143 --> 02:30:00.964]  We're good to go.
[02:30:17.382 --> 02:30:23.465]  And that's what they're telling about, that this is the idea is a massive sacrifice.
[02:30:23.505 --> 02:30:32.309]  So when the Bible and the book of Revelations talks about pretty much before Jesus comes there's going to be 3 billion people destroyed, they're going to do it in whatever way.
[02:30:32.329 --> 02:30:38.372]  The hemorrhagic flu is the ultimate, ultimate viral infestation that will
[02:30:38.912 --> 02:30:49.662]  Basically satisfied the bloodlust of the Luciferian vampires, and that's why there's 400,000 Northcombe-born and mercenary troops already in their bases.
[02:30:49.742 --> 02:30:50.964]  The time frame is now.
[02:30:51.404 --> 02:30:53.486]  And see, this is the hard part, Alex.
[02:30:53.626 --> 02:30:54.567]  I shake my head.
[02:30:54.647 --> 02:30:55.528]  I know you do, too.
[02:30:55.928 --> 02:31:01.654]  I know when you go home at night, you sit and you talk to your wife, you try and have, you know, just a normal time with your kids, hug them, love them.
[02:31:02.054 --> 02:31:14.700]  But it's in the back of your mind, these are absolute monsters out there trying to rob you and I and every other father and every other wife and every other child and every parent of their children.
[02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:22.664]  And that's the thing that, I don't know about you, but when I say it makes me crazy, it literally infuriates me that people sit back
[02:31:23.224 --> 02:31:25.325]  Steve Quayle, Steve, amazing interview.
[02:31:25.826 --> 02:31:29.387]  I hope everybody does pray and gets involved so we can avert this happening like Nineveh.
[02:31:29.648 --> 02:31:31.589]  We'll continue to track this as long as we can.
[02:31:31.609 --> 02:31:32.449]  SteveQuayle.com.
[02:31:32.469 --> 02:31:33.690]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:31:33.710 --> 02:31:34.670]  Bless you, Alex.
[02:31:34.710 --> 02:31:37.492]  We're going to pray for you tonight on my show.
[02:31:50.936 --> 02:31:51.877]  Thank you so much, Steve.
[02:31:51.897 --> 02:31:52.657]  We'll be right back.
[02:31:53.017 --> 02:31:54.418]  Continuing to break all this down.
[02:31:54.438 --> 02:31:56.039]  The times that drive men's souls.
[02:31:57.640 --> 02:32:02.803]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:32:02.943 --> 02:32:04.844]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:32:05.024 --> 02:32:07.305]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:32:07.465 --> 02:32:09.326]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:32:09.746 --> 02:32:11.107]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:32:11.367 --> 02:32:12.408]  There is a solution.
[02:32:12.628 --> 02:32:20.653]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:32:59.899 --> 02:33:03.222]  A new world order in the near future.
[02:33:04.537 --> 02:33:07.179]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:33:07.199 --> 02:33:09.381]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:33:10.441 --> 02:33:12.683]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:33:13.223 --> 02:33:15.665]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:33:16.406 --> 02:33:23.711]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:33:26.741 --> 02:33:31.704]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:33:32.185 --> 02:33:35.667]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.

[02:33:57.422 --> 02:33:58.122]  Hello, friends.
[02:33:58.162 --> 02:34:01.165]  This is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[02:34:01.305 --> 02:34:11.173]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned, pure, handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.
[02:34:11.474 --> 02:34:15.177]  Go to 5starsoaps.com or click on their link at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:15.397 --> 02:34:17.179]  They have been a longtime sponsor of ours.

[02:34:21.182 --> 02:34:23.344]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[02:34:23.744 --> 02:34:28.892]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Pure Soap products.

[02:34:53.937 --> 02:34:55.639]  You will never use anything else again.
[02:34:58.761 --> 02:35:00.962]  He's that directs a political talk.
[02:35:01.523 --> 02:35:04.305]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:35:09.525 --> 02:35:15.609]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, I'm going to break down psychology today's hit piece against me.
[02:35:16.209 --> 02:35:28.597]  And just talk about psychiatry and psychology itself, how it's always used by the communist Chinese, by the Nazis, by the East Germans, by the Soviets, and now in the U.S.
[02:35:28.617 --> 02:35:36.982]  I mean, they say I'm a schizophrenic, there's no world government, there's no New World Order, there's no eugenics, there's no John P. Holdren.
[02:35:37.745 --> 02:35:39.406]  That's not in the Associated Press.
[02:35:40.166 --> 02:35:43.967]  And then they've got all these ads admitting the drugs they sell in here make you commit suicide.
[02:35:44.787 --> 02:35:50.169]  I mean, these are some dirty, rotten people who just play games with people and screw folks up.
[02:35:50.990 --> 02:35:51.890]  So I'm gonna go over it.
[02:35:54.453 --> 02:35:55.473]  And they know it, too.
[02:35:55.553 --> 02:35:57.794]  They think it's funny how they prey on people.
[02:35:58.494 --> 02:36:04.095]  How they run the public schools and brainwash people and teach the kids how to commit suicide through suicide education.
[02:36:04.475 --> 02:36:06.896]  Death education that actually makes more suicides happen.
[02:36:07.276 --> 02:36:09.396]  Because it puts the idea in the kids' heads and teaches them how to do it.
[02:36:09.856 --> 02:36:10.737]  That's all coming up.
[02:36:11.577 --> 02:36:15.618]  But I wanted to bring up Darryl Castle, former vice presidential candidate, to Chuck Baldwin.
[02:36:16.698 --> 02:36:20.859]  And we appreciate him coming on with us.
[02:36:23.069 --> 02:36:23.870]  Very interesting fellow.
[02:36:24.230 --> 02:36:26.353]  He's a commissioned officer in the United States Marine Corps.
[02:36:26.373 --> 02:36:30.397]  He served for four years during the Vietnam era after leaving the Marines.
[02:36:30.417 --> 02:36:42.610]  He went to graduate school in history at ETSU and then entered Memphis State University Law School where he graduated with a doctorate and he also runs a private firm.
[02:36:43.513 --> 02:36:43.993]  That's right.
[02:37:06.664 --> 02:37:17.551]  Ron Paul's a terrorist, gun owners, veterans, number one threat in the DHS and MIAC report, and he went to one of the state hearings with the legislature on this last week.
[02:37:17.931 --> 02:37:29.139]  So we thought we'd get him to pop in to talk about this in light of federal marshals going public, saying they've been ordered to put innocent people at airports in databases just to show a terror threat.
[02:37:30.157 --> 02:37:36.380]  And now the Attorney General's saying, if you're on a no-fly, over 1,200,000 on it, you'll not be able to own guns.
[02:37:36.480 --> 02:37:44.464]  So, we also have FBI training videos for local police saying, if somebody's got a cell phone, put them in a terror database for life.
[02:37:45.344 --> 02:37:48.686]  So it's just the total federalization, the police being turned into secret police.
[02:37:49.577 --> 02:38:00.693]  Just, and now you've got Obama openly saying on October 8th, the kids will all assemble in America with big screen TVs and auditoriums with him, asking them to serve him with his agenda.
[02:38:01.093 --> 02:38:04.618]  Al Gore at auditoriums, we're going to play this audio later, it's up on the website.
[02:38:05.359 --> 02:38:13.244]  Saying that your parents don't know what they're doing, global warming's real, your parents are bad, like people that wanted to keep blacks as slaves.
[02:38:14.004 --> 02:38:20.428]  I mean, we're entering a vortex of Soviet Nazification.
[02:38:21.028 --> 02:38:23.770]  And I wanted to talk to Darryl Castle about this.
[02:38:23.830 --> 02:38:25.250]  Mr. Castle, good to have you on with us.
[02:38:25.551 --> 02:38:26.091]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:38:26.131 --> 02:38:27.752]  It's good to be with you.
[02:38:28.882 --> 02:38:36.525]  All this going on, you heard me just break this down, your take on being listed as, I guess, kind of a terrorist commander?
[02:38:37.265 --> 02:38:41.047]  Well, yes, I guess that's right.
[02:38:41.867 --> 02:38:54.012]  It was rather stunning to see, really, but they did apologize for that listing and withdraw the report, but I'm afraid that it's still there under some deeper
[02:38:57.349 --> 02:38:58.209]  Well, absolutely.
[02:38:58.249 --> 02:39:02.191]  Missouri, of course, was just a clone of federal, and that came out in the DHS report.
[02:39:02.911 --> 02:39:10.893]  Tell us what it was like when you learned of this in the campaign, that Ron Paul stickers, Chuck Baldwin stickers, Constitution Party stickers.
[02:39:11.293 --> 02:39:13.274]  Go ahead and pull people over, ask them questions.
[02:39:13.674 --> 02:39:16.535]  Ron Paul supporters being stopped at airports now and asked about it.
[02:39:17.215 --> 02:39:19.376]  And then going to these hearings, what you learned?
[02:39:20.202 --> 02:39:29.610]  Well, the interesting thing for me about the hearings was the back and forth with the legislators and the questions that they asked me after I spoke.
[02:39:30.570 --> 02:39:47.704]  But listening to the testimony of the police officers that they had there and how they used this report and what they thought about the entire MIAC process and that sort of thing was fascinating because they had two police captains from the Kansas City Police Department
[02:39:48.598 --> 02:40:03.784]  Both of them are fine officers, recruiting poster type officers, and one of them is directly in charge of MIAC and abusing it, and he talks about how they need it for officer safety.
[02:40:04.724 --> 02:40:18.390]  It's vital information that they just have to have, and that the real problem, these officers thought, was that this report was distributed to civilians that did not understand it and who should not have had the information.
[02:40:19.506 --> 02:40:19.987]  I think so.
[02:40:39.517 --> 02:40:45.100]  But let me just add, sir, we have the training videos, and we broke the MIAC report, we broke the DHS.
[02:40:45.661 --> 02:40:50.544]  They're putting you in databases as a terrorist or a terrorist supporter.
[02:40:51.224 --> 02:41:05.233]  This is now up on our YouTube channel, but while we're talking, maybe you guys can roll some of the video in the background, because for those who just joined us, we also simulcast the radio show as a TV show, but we have this FBI training video where they're putting you in databases
[02:41:06.793 --> 02:41:15.476]  And now with this news out, it's being used as a chilling effect, and the Attorney General's saying, no judge, no jury, no way to ever get off the list.
[02:41:16.097 --> 02:41:21.018]  If you're listed as an extremist for being a veteran or a gun owner, you don't ever get to own guns anymore.
[02:41:21.659 --> 02:41:34.143]  Well, they told us, one of the legislators told me in this hearing, he said quite forthrightly that if you got on the terrorist watch list, they gave the procedure for getting off
[02:41:34.887 --> 02:41:36.268]  Well, I'm not like bragging that we were broken.
[02:41:36.308 --> 02:41:45.434]  I'm just saying we get sent all this material, and it's, if you know the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, as I know you've studied it, and if you know tyranny, this is the most hardcore
[02:42:04.284 --> 02:42:04.764]  Tyranny.
[02:42:05.204 --> 02:42:07.185]  I mean, it's like the Hope Diamond of Diamonds.
[02:42:07.265 --> 02:42:09.726]  It's like the Henry Ford of Ford.
[02:42:09.807 --> 02:42:11.927]  It's the Adolf Hitler of Hitler.
[02:42:11.967 --> 02:42:18.330]  I mean, it's the most hardcore, vicious, horrible type, and it's really happening.
[02:42:19.311 --> 02:42:20.051]  It really is.
[02:42:20.111 --> 02:42:30.496]  And this report, as I testified the other day, in my opinion, was designed to radicalize the police against legitimate mainstream political activity.
[02:42:31.451 --> 02:42:37.814]  To create an atmosphere of fear and intimidation, and it seems to be succeeding.
[02:42:39.875 --> 02:42:54.483]  Yeah, if they win, I mean, if we stop saying, OK, we're for the Second Amendment, OK, we're for controlling the borders, OK, we're against abortion, because we're going to be put on a secret police list and can't fly, or Homeland Security's saying have a job or own a gun, I mean, this is it.
[02:42:54.523 --> 02:42:56.364]  If we give in to this and shut up, they win.
[02:42:57.270 --> 02:43:05.613]  Well, that's exactly right, and that's why I'm spending so much time traveling around the country talking to anybody that will listen to me about it.
[02:43:05.993 --> 02:43:15.536]  It is terrible, and it's difficult to understand that it's actually happening right here in front of us, but it's amazing to watch and to experience.
[02:43:16.155 --> 02:43:32.161]  Well, when you were an officer in the Marine Corps back in the 70s, could you have ever, because I know this is what people were taught about the Soviet Union, could you have ever imagined the police would be federalized and secret police and the number one threat for homeland security and NORTHCOM would be veterans and gun owners?
[02:43:32.761 --> 02:43:44.225]  No, I could never have imagined that, but they did tell us when they sent us to the Far East that if we didn't go over there and fight them in the Far East, the Communists would be crawling up the beaches in California.
[02:43:44.975 --> 02:43:46.296]  As it turns out, they were right.
[02:43:48.999 --> 02:44:01.010]  Well, I mean, have you seen this, that Obama's going to make all the kids in the country muster before him with big movie screens as he, as he quote, asks them for help with his agenda?
[02:44:01.070 --> 02:44:03.252]  I mean, I'm pinching myself.
[02:44:03.412 --> 02:44:06.034]  I mean, I can't even believe this, Mr. Castle.
[02:44:06.054 --> 02:44:07.756]  That's Adolf Hitler type stuff.
[02:44:08.116 --> 02:44:09.958]  I mean, I can't believe any parent would
[02:44:11.263 --> 02:44:15.487]  Would allow their child to be subjected to that type of brainwashing, but apparently they will.
[02:44:17.549 --> 02:44:19.691]  Well, where does the Constitution Party go from here?
[02:44:20.151 --> 02:44:21.272]  I mean, but they didn't stop with you.
[02:44:21.312 --> 02:44:24.896]  They said Bob Barr and the Libertarians, and they're pretty milquetoast.
[02:44:24.976 --> 02:44:28.939]  I mean, I mean, I mean, is the is the milkman?
[02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:31.702]  I mean, are they going to list Apple Pie as terrorism next?
[02:44:32.102 --> 02:44:33.684]  Well, Ron Paul, a sitting U.S.
[02:44:33.724 --> 02:44:35.325]  Congressman, was also listed.
[02:44:35.726 --> 02:44:37.167]  He's a fairly calm individual.
[02:44:38.053 --> 02:44:39.654]  Uh, and a lot of people support him.
[02:44:39.734 --> 02:44:44.977]  In fact, over 270 congressmen have endorsed his, uh, Audit the Fed bill.
[02:44:45.037 --> 02:44:47.258]  So, you know, he's really not that dangerous.
[02:44:47.338 --> 02:44:50.940]  But, uh, these folks are, uh, they're amazing.
[02:44:51.020 --> 02:44:52.061]  I'm telling you.
[02:44:52.241 --> 02:44:53.161]  I suppose you're right.
[02:44:53.781 --> 02:44:55.402]  If you don't agree with them, you're a terrorist.
[02:44:55.422 --> 02:44:56.543]  That's what it comes down to.
[02:44:58.186 --> 02:44:59.987]  I do think it's backfiring on them, though.
[02:45:00.027 --> 02:45:11.536]  I mean, Americans have enough memory of tyranny, at least from Hollywood, of what it looks like, and people that are veterans that have seen it around the world, that I... But these people aren't stopping.
[02:45:11.576 --> 02:45:13.778]  They say they're going for broke.
[02:45:13.818 --> 02:45:15.919]  So, how do you think this is all going to end?
[02:45:18.921 --> 02:45:22.144]  I somewhat follow the line of reasoning that your former guest had.
[02:45:24.466 --> 02:45:27.608]  And so, it looks terrible.
[02:45:28.533 --> 02:45:29.253]  We're good to go.
[02:45:49.684 --> 02:45:50.624]  Well, that's another thing.
[02:45:51.085 --> 02:45:58.048]  October 8th, because they're still doing this Obama thing, everyone should not send their children to the government schools, at least on that day.
[02:45:58.708 --> 02:46:01.509]  I mean, there should be a big sick day that day, you're right.
[02:46:03.650 --> 02:46:09.613]  We need somebody to go ahead and go, though, and maybe send a hidden camera with their kids to, like, imagine the footage of that.
[02:46:09.633 --> 02:46:12.854]  I guess they'll show it on the news, the kids, like, swearing allegiance.
[02:46:12.874 --> 02:46:16.076]  I mean, it says that to the President, not to the Constitution.
[02:46:17.543 --> 02:46:22.686]  You can go back and see films of that from the 30s when Hitler spoke at his gigantic rallies.
[02:46:23.346 --> 02:46:28.068]  It's so reminiscent of those types of things that you see on the History Channel now.
[02:46:29.309 --> 02:46:32.510]  Yeah, the History Channel, known as the Hitler Channel, that's all they cover.
[02:46:32.530 --> 02:46:37.152]  Yeah, in fact, he made them swear allegiance to him above the Constitution.
[02:46:39.870 --> 02:46:45.693]  Again, we can play clip after clip of the President calling for national compulsory domestic paramilitary service.
[02:46:45.733 --> 02:46:49.335]  Stay there, Mr. Castle, a VP with Chuck Baldwin Constitution Party.
[02:46:49.735 --> 02:46:50.576]  He was at the hearing.
[02:46:50.596 --> 02:46:56.039]  I want to hear a little more about his testimony, his view, and what he'd like to see happen with these reports.
[02:46:58.320 --> 02:46:59.821]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:47:00.001 --> 02:47:01.442]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:47:01.742 --> 02:47:03.963]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.

[02:48:56.637 --> 02:49:01.020]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:49:01.420 --> 02:49:06.903]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:49:07.484 --> 02:49:07.984]  That's right.
[02:49:08.304 --> 02:49:10.585]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:49:11.986 --> 02:49:18.070]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:49:18.610 --> 02:49:26.295]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:49:26.756 --> 02:49:31.599]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:49:32.239 --> 02:49:37.243]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:49:38.043 --> 02:49:42.146]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:49:42.546 --> 02:49:44.727]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:49:45.408 --> 02:49:47.589]  Make sure that you secure your future.

[02:49:58.436 --> 02:50:03.919]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[02:50:04.159 --> 02:50:05.500]  And we knew what to do.
[02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:07.261]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:50:07.502 --> 02:50:09.163]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film.
[02:50:10.359 --> 02:50:13.866]  It finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.

[02:50:23.430 --> 02:50:30.215]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.

[02:50:33.678 --> 02:50:38.902]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:50:39.462 --> 02:50:42.084]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[02:51:21.658 --> 02:51:23.159]  Sir, just in a few minutes we've got a legend.
[02:51:23.179 --> 02:51:24.300]  I appreciate your time today.
[02:51:27.963 --> 02:51:30.265]  What else happened during the testimony?
[02:51:30.285 --> 02:51:35.609]  We heard there was testimony about provocateur, anarchist, and then complaining they couldn't get anybody to do anything illegal.
[02:51:37.010 --> 02:51:39.112]  What are some of the other areas?
[02:51:40.213 --> 02:51:46.258]  Well, the focus of the hearing was really on how can we prevent this?
[02:51:47.082 --> 02:51:48.283]  from happening again.
[02:51:48.323 --> 02:51:56.067]  This legislative committee in Missouri is set up to look at ways to prevent this type of political profiling and so forth.
[02:51:56.787 --> 02:51:58.007]  So that was the direction.
[02:51:58.068 --> 02:52:00.509]  The police testified that they needed the information.
[02:52:01.509 --> 02:52:06.912]  And every single person who testified other than the police talked about how bad it was.
[02:52:08.233 --> 02:52:12.915]  And there were some of the legislators were very much on our side and
[02:52:13.826 --> 02:52:20.570]  Essentially tried to feed us questions that would allow us to elaborate on our positions and that sort of thing.
[02:52:20.650 --> 02:52:27.133]  But I have no doubt that this report is still out there under a deeper classification.
[02:52:27.733 --> 02:52:34.577]  And I tried to address with the committee that what I was really concerned about is the mindset of the people who wrote this thing.
[02:52:35.437 --> 02:52:40.400]  And the fact that even though they may apologize, the information is still there.
[02:52:41.271 --> 02:52:44.673]  The police still have it and that entire mindset still exists.
[02:52:45.473 --> 02:52:51.817]  And so they are profiling legitimate political thought that's protected by the First Amendment.
[02:52:52.497 --> 02:52:57.860]  And they are radicalizing the police against legitimate political action and political thought.
[02:52:58.640 --> 02:53:08.586]  And it does create an atmosphere of fear and intimidation in the minds of people who live in Missouri who might have a Baldwin Castle bumper sticker or a Ron Paul.
[02:53:09.232 --> 02:53:10.753]  That was my take on the hearing as a whole.
[02:53:35.506 --> 02:53:37.087]  Well, where does it go from here?
[02:53:37.127 --> 02:53:41.188]  I mean, do we just allow America to turn into the complete tyranny?
[02:53:41.789 --> 02:53:44.290]  I mean, the police come and are defending it.
[02:53:44.330 --> 02:53:45.330]  They think it's normal.
[02:53:46.050 --> 02:53:55.975]  We've just incrementally gotten so deep into corruption that this is the new America and they just admit, yeah, we put innocent people on list and you don't have rights anymore, no judge, no jury.
[02:53:58.068 --> 02:54:04.011]  And they built this whole Homeland Security apparatus saying it was for foreign terrorists, and now they say, oh, it's really for you!
[02:54:04.031 --> 02:54:05.432]  The American people!
[02:54:06.352 --> 02:54:09.214]  Well, I'm afraid that, Alex, that that's where we are.
[02:54:09.354 --> 02:54:11.655]  And I expressed that view to the committee.
[02:54:11.715 --> 02:54:13.416]  A couple of the legislators asked me.
[02:54:14.656 --> 02:54:20.039]  One lady in particular said, well, given your ideology, what would you have us do?
[02:54:20.099 --> 02:54:23.861]  What would your suggestion be for how we deal with this type of thing?
[02:54:23.901 --> 02:54:24.561]  And I said, well,
[02:54:25.490 --> 02:54:40.963]  I suggest that you ferret out this information, where it came from, and fire everyone who tested and had anything to do with it, and that you do what you're obligated to do, which is protect the liberty of the citizens of the state of Missouri.
[02:54:41.904 --> 02:54:48.030]  I think this whole apparatus should be taken apart, this whole MIAC apparatus, and never assembled again.
[02:54:48.590 --> 02:54:51.933]  And you should sever your relationship with these various fusion centers.
[02:54:52.628 --> 02:54:52.768]  Well,
[02:55:22.170 --> 02:55:28.314]  Look, this is classical tyranny, and the police and the military have to understand that this isn't a game.
[02:55:28.374 --> 02:55:30.916]  This is real, hardcore tyranny.
[02:55:31.076 --> 02:55:32.497]  This is a real takeover.
[02:55:33.358 --> 02:55:35.979]  And this is the real destruction of our republic.
[02:55:36.740 --> 02:55:40.863]  And people just better decry this and say no, and do something about it.
[02:55:40.903 --> 02:55:42.564]  We can't allow this to continue.
[02:55:42.864 --> 02:55:45.065]  We can't just give in to this inchworm effect.
[02:55:45.446 --> 02:55:51.950]  I played Van Jones, the White House community organizing head, saying they're gonna have total redistribution of wealth,
[02:55:52.891 --> 02:56:01.778]  Total, the FCC diversity chief says they want Chavez style censorship and that they're going to do it all incrementally.
[02:56:02.359 --> 02:56:10.465]  I mean these people are for real and it even shocks me that we've got real hardcore tyrants but it's here.
[02:56:11.766 --> 02:56:18.972]  It's here and it's now and unfortunately my impression from the police who testified at this hearing is that they
[02:56:20.666 --> 02:56:24.188]  Those were good men, but they really don't understand the problem.
[02:56:24.909 --> 02:56:34.454]  They don't understand why this type of thing is bad, and where it's taking them as police officers who are out there supposedly protecting and serving.
[02:56:35.375 --> 02:56:37.096]  It's totally and completely sick.
[02:56:37.936 --> 02:56:40.458]  Mr. Castle, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:56:40.498 --> 02:56:41.259]  We'll stay in touch.
[02:56:41.519 --> 02:56:42.139]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:56:42.159 --> 02:56:42.839]  I appreciate it.
[02:56:43.300 --> 02:56:43.580]  You bet.
[02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:46.161]  We'll be right back with a huge news blitz and other key info.
[02:56:46.181 --> 02:56:46.662]  Stay with us.
[02:56:48.188 --> 02:56:51.175]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:56:52.117 --> 02:56:54.824]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:56:57.585 --> 02:57:01.566]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:57:01.826 --> 02:57:03.606]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:57:03.826 --> 02:57:12.108]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:57:12.348 --> 02:57:17.570]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:57:17.910 --> 02:57:19.510]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:57:19.770 --> 02:57:26.095]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:57:26.295 --> 02:57:37.044]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[02:57:37.344 --> 02:57:37.845]  That's right.
[02:57:38.105 --> 02:57:40.427]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[02:57:44.070 --> 02:57:44.570]  6043.
[02:57:44.190 --> 02:57:44.570]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[02:57:44.590 --> 02:57:48.172]  Or visit A Cola Blue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.

[02:58:01.201 --> 02:58:01.641]  It's here!
[02:58:01.842 --> 02:58:06.606]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:58:06.986 --> 02:58:14.613]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:58:15.339 --> 02:58:22.381]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:58:22.762 --> 02:58:34.185]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:58:34.505 --> 02:58:38.027]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:58:38.467 --> 02:58:40.127]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:58:40.728 --> 02:58:44.569]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:58:58.010 --> 02:58:59.271]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:59.311 --> 02:59:04.676]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:59:04.897 --> 02:59:09.521]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:59:09.921 --> 02:59:10.322]  It's true.
[02:59:10.402 --> 02:59:14.946]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:59:15.501 --> 02:59:20.185]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:59:20.705 --> 02:59:22.647]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:59:23.027 --> 02:59:27.631]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:59:27.831 --> 02:59:28.732]  And here's the best part.
[02:59:28.952 --> 02:59:31.694]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:59:31.714 --> 02:59:35.337]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:59:35.657 --> 02:59:38.480]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:59:38.840 --> 02:59:40.721]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:59:41.062 --> 02:59:41.982]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:59:46.992 --> 02:59:49.316]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:59:49.857 --> 02:59:54.365]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:59:54.685 --> 02:59:57.070]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:00:15.669 --> 03:00:20.210]  We're good to go.
[03:00:48.940 --> 03:00:52.302]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live here.
[03:00:52.322 --> 03:00:54.463]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:00:54.543 --> 03:01:00.787]  I want to tell you about a couple of the sponsors for making the show possible this hour, and then I'm going to get into psychology today.
[03:01:01.167 --> 03:01:07.351]  I briefly got into it yesterday, but I want to just concisely go over it here coming up in just a few moments.
[03:01:08.311 --> 03:01:11.338]  First off, though, survivalseedbank.com.
[03:01:11.358 --> 03:01:18.352]  In a real-life crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[03:01:19.138 --> 03:01:24.260]  There have been times in American history, Pilgrim for example, when seeds have the highest value of any barter item.
[03:01:24.680 --> 03:01:31.522]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds, waged by the global elite, who want to control us by controlling the food supply.
[03:01:31.842 --> 03:01:42.046]  By the way, I have a AP article today about the head of the UN, Mr. Moon, visiting one of the, quote, secret seed vaults at the North Pole.
[03:01:43.766 --> 03:01:45.767]  It's just, just, just, just incredible.
[03:01:46.971 --> 03:01:49.496]  Because every time I read this ad, I get an email saying I'm making that up.
[03:01:49.596 --> 03:01:50.638]  No, we're not making that up.
[03:01:52.341 --> 03:01:54.365]  Just absolutely amazing.
[03:01:54.405 --> 03:01:56.288]  In fact, here it is, AFP.
[03:01:56.930 --> 03:01:59.615]  UN boss visits global seed vault.
[03:02:00.931 --> 03:02:02.372]  Side issue, I'm plugging a sponsor.
[03:02:02.392 --> 03:02:03.934]  If you don't want to believe it, fine, don't.
[03:02:04.394 --> 03:02:12.381]  The point is survivalseedbank.com, high quality survival seed banks, non-GMO, non-hybrid, survivalseedbank.com or 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, survivalseedbank.com.
[03:02:12.401 --> 03:02:12.661]  Continuing.
[03:02:23.160 --> 03:02:25.121]  Here, ladies and gentlemen, Front Sight.
[03:02:25.701 --> 03:02:34.106]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza, the founder of the Front Sight Firearms Training Institute, is offering a free handgun and five days of firearms training to my listeners.
[03:02:34.546 --> 03:02:41.030]  This offer is only available for a limited time because Dr. Piazza is literally paying his own money out of his pocket to be able to offer you this deal.
[03:02:41.050 --> 03:02:42.811]  And it won't last forever, so listen up.
[03:02:43.331 --> 03:02:51.614]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Frontside Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[03:02:52.154 --> 03:02:56.756]  Act fast and they will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[03:02:57.236 --> 03:03:02.618]  If you believe now is the time for you and your family to be armed and trained at levels that exceed even law enforcement military standards.
[03:03:02.998 --> 03:03:07.240]  Frontside provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[03:03:07.720 --> 03:03:11.502]  Thousands have already taken advantage of this opportunity, and you should too, so don't miss out.
[03:03:11.822 --> 03:03:13.342]  The website's Frontside.com.
[03:03:13.362 --> 03:03:15.063]  Again, that's Frontside.com.
[03:03:15.463 --> 03:03:18.124]  F-R-O-N-T-A-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[03:03:18.404 --> 03:03:19.165]  Check them out today.
[03:03:20.725 --> 03:03:28.849]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let me now go ahead and get into psychology today, as I promised that I would do.
[03:03:32.185 --> 03:03:40.028]  And I'll get my guys to zoom in here while I'm talking so people that are watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, not just listening to the radio, can actually see this.
[03:03:40.288 --> 03:03:41.508]  Here's psychology today.
[03:03:42.069 --> 03:03:46.890]  This guy called me back in, that was like three months ago.
[03:03:49.471 --> 03:03:50.652]  So I guess May or so.
[03:03:52.128 --> 03:03:58.711]  But he calls me and he says, oh, interesting phenomenon about your show, we're interested in it, and I said, this is a hit piece, they say I'm a schizophrenic.
[03:03:59.231 --> 03:04:02.653]  And he said, no, but that's, you know, paranoid, like a schizophrenic.
[03:04:03.573 --> 03:04:17.419]  And I said, well, no, I mean, the standard thing in the Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, Communist China, and even here in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, right up to the 80s, was you would take poor families' kids and sterilize them, and if they complained, you'd lobotomize them.
[03:04:18.139 --> 03:04:21.161]  And then he laughed and said, we didn't do that, so I sent him links
[03:04:22.315 --> 03:04:30.618]  To public lobotomies where they would stick an ice pick through the corner of the eye back into the brain and he would then laugh about that and deny it.
[03:04:31.499 --> 03:04:34.580]  And I told him about psychiatry used by Hitler and he'd laugh at that.
[03:04:34.600 --> 03:04:37.161]  I told him about eugenics and he would laugh at that.
[03:04:37.181 --> 03:04:41.003]  I'd tell him about population control and UN documents and I'd give him links.
[03:04:41.883 --> 03:04:55.045]  He'd laugh about that, and he'd list a document that we listed that calls for using food as a weapon and starvation and sterilization, and he just says the doc- he doesn't say the document doesn't say that, he just says it was a boring policy report.
[03:04:57.475 --> 03:05:06.577]  And what they are is they're control freak yuppies, mainly, who statistically have the highest mental illness rate and the highest suicide rate of any profession.
[03:05:06.898 --> 03:05:10.118]  They're always caught raping their patients.
[03:05:10.198 --> 03:05:14.740]  It's not a real medical system, either psychiatrist or psychologist.
[03:05:15.300 --> 03:05:17.540]  They just prance around drugging everybody.
[03:05:17.560 --> 03:05:22.302]  They've got hundreds of new designations the last few years, many of them for
[03:05:23.782 --> 03:05:26.064]  If you don't trust the government, it's a mental illness.
[03:05:26.424 --> 03:05:28.085]  And they say that in this article.
[03:05:28.926 --> 03:05:34.230]  They say that, well, chemical imbalance in the brain makes you not trust the government.
[03:05:34.690 --> 03:05:36.292]  And that it leads to schizophrenia.
[03:05:36.352 --> 03:05:39.014]  And that they know that that's a certain chemical in the brain.
[03:05:39.934 --> 03:05:41.115]  And they're talking about me!
[03:05:41.536 --> 03:05:42.616]  They didn't test my blood.
[03:05:42.656 --> 03:05:45.138]  They didn't test the dopamine levels in my brain.
[03:05:45.158 --> 03:05:47.160]  They didn't do a biopsy.
[03:05:50.100 --> 03:05:52.081]  They didn't do a cab, they just make this up.
[03:05:52.121 --> 03:05:55.322]  I mean, I'm here with the articles, with the textbooks.
[03:05:55.662 --> 03:05:57.263]  It's the same game, though.
[03:05:57.523 --> 03:05:58.884]  They know it's all real.
[03:05:59.844 --> 03:06:01.425]  I mean, we sent them the government documents.
[03:06:01.825 --> 03:06:08.108]  It's just like the White House saying, we don't want National Compulsory Service, we don't want forced youth brigades, it's all conspiracy theorists.
[03:06:08.448 --> 03:06:10.389]  Media Matters and George Soros attacked me.
[03:06:10.669 --> 03:06:15.351]  Daily Costs, Think Progress, all these government-run groups.
[03:06:16.550 --> 03:06:26.559]  And then the President's going to address the school kids and ask for their help, and they got City Year in red and black uniforms and Secure Corps training with M-16s to quote, take on right-wing extremists.
[03:06:26.619 --> 03:06:33.985]  And you've got Van Jones saying we're going to incrementally take over for total redistribution of wealth from the White House.
[03:06:34.045 --> 03:06:35.687]  And we've got Al Gore.
[03:06:35.747 --> 03:06:39.110]  You can just Google it and you'll pull up him at a town hall.
[03:06:39.870 --> 03:06:44.695]  At a middle school, telling the kids, your parents' beliefs are wrong.
[03:06:45.075 --> 03:06:46.577]  It's like racism before.
[03:06:46.597 --> 03:06:48.218]  It was young people that fought racism.
[03:06:48.238 --> 03:06:49.219]  They always mix that in.
[03:06:49.620 --> 03:06:50.881]  Climate change is real.
[03:06:52.262 --> 03:06:57.487]  I mean, they introduce legislation that says National Compulsory Service, Rahm Emanuel's on tape saying it.
[03:06:58.788 --> 03:07:01.211]  But they'll just laugh and say, it doesn't exist, you're schizophrenic.
[03:07:02.639 --> 03:07:04.961]  But this isn't working anymore.
[03:07:05.642 --> 03:07:06.583]  People are seeing through it.
[03:07:06.603 --> 03:07:18.795]  You have this profession of witch doctors from 150 years ago, founded in Germany, because the Prussians wanted to literally have mind control slaves for the military.
[03:07:19.135 --> 03:07:19.916]  That's on record.
[03:07:19.956 --> 03:07:22.319]  Kindergarten, all of it, was designed for this.
[03:07:22.379 --> 03:07:23.380]  Our whole current system.
[03:07:24.824 --> 03:07:25.584]  And this is history.
[03:07:25.984 --> 03:07:28.145]  And look at the first page of Psychology Today.
[03:07:28.485 --> 03:07:31.966]  It's this psychotropic drug where this woman's a wind-up toy.
[03:07:32.126 --> 03:07:33.567]  I've seen the TV ads for this.
[03:07:34.587 --> 03:07:42.929]  And when she takes the drug, she's suddenly a smiling, happy zombie now.
[03:07:45.950 --> 03:07:47.651]  And it's got the drug over here.
[03:07:48.897 --> 03:07:51.939]  And, you know, they have to go on and admit, oh, it increases suicide risk.
[03:07:52.699 --> 03:07:56.281]  And then you flip in some more, and they've got some more drug ads.
[03:07:56.361 --> 03:07:59.463]  And, again, these are the high priests that are going to teach you to be okay.
[03:07:59.503 --> 03:08:02.265]  And they're going to explain to you how the universe works.
[03:08:02.305 --> 03:08:12.771]  And you've got Amplify, that's a drug that you take for the other psychotropics that cause your psychotic break.
[03:08:13.609 --> 03:08:20.053]  And then they've got a thing about old world order 9-11 and it's all about being trendy and how to get women and how your brain works.
[03:08:20.453 --> 03:08:21.874]  I mean, this is like for control freaks.
[03:08:25.156 --> 03:08:28.838]  And it's got all these ads.
[03:08:28.858 --> 03:08:30.039]  You'll be a psychologist.
[03:08:30.059 --> 03:08:31.800]  You can make lots of money doing it.
[03:08:31.820 --> 03:08:36.883]  And they've got other ads here for drugs and how great atheism is.
[03:08:40.683 --> 03:08:41.563]  It's just amazing.
[03:08:41.743 --> 03:08:43.164]  And then you get to this page.
[03:08:43.244 --> 03:08:45.485]  Page 36.
[03:08:47.586 --> 03:08:49.366]  And it's a two-page drug ad.
[03:08:49.386 --> 03:08:49.366]  36.
[03:08:49.846 --> 03:08:51.607]  I mean, 35 and 36.
[03:08:54.568 --> 03:08:58.149]  Now, if I was talking to this psychologist and brought this up, he would just not say anything.
[03:08:58.189 --> 03:08:58.830]  Or he'd laugh.
[03:08:59.190 --> 03:09:01.531]  And I'd go, does that ad exist?
[03:09:01.591 --> 03:09:02.331]  And he would just giggle.
[03:09:03.820 --> 03:09:04.761]  And say, oh, you're upset.
[03:09:04.781 --> 03:09:05.721]  Are you having a moment?
[03:09:05.801 --> 03:09:07.582]  I mean, this is just a mind game.
[03:09:07.602 --> 03:09:09.043]  These are just scam artists.
[03:09:09.083 --> 03:09:09.964]  I mean, it's a joke.
[03:09:10.364 --> 03:09:11.845]  But they find weak-minded people.
[03:09:11.865 --> 03:09:13.206]  They prey on the kids in the schools.
[03:09:13.466 --> 03:09:19.629]  The New Freedom Initiative, government's own documents, they got leaked in 2005, said that their plan is to put half the school kids on drugs.
[03:09:19.930 --> 03:09:23.091]  That New Freedom is about diagnosing basically everyone as mentally ill.
[03:09:25.453 --> 03:09:32.217]  And then it says right here, Lamictal,
[03:09:34.079 --> 03:09:40.161]  Arelemictal, ODT make, this is like a candy, it tastes good and dissolves in the mouth, they say, it's psychotropic.
[03:09:40.782 --> 03:09:45.604]  May cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, 1 in 500, a lot higher than that.
[03:09:46.504 --> 03:09:47.344]  Studies actually show.
[03:09:47.704 --> 03:09:55.187]  Call a health care provider right away if you have worsening depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or thoughts and actions about suicide.
[03:09:55.408 --> 03:09:56.928]  And you actually read the full insert?
[03:09:57.428 --> 03:10:02.010]  I mean, it's delusions of grandeur, psychotic breaks, wanting to murder people.
[03:10:04.454 --> 03:10:11.397]  And it goes over to the next page with even more of the horrible effects, just scores of them, just absolutely horrible.
[03:10:11.917 --> 03:10:13.257]  This is like jumping off a cliff.
[03:10:14.438 --> 03:10:17.999]  Now they know that when you take these drugs, you're going to have more mental problems.
[03:10:18.019 --> 03:10:22.681]  And the average person that goes on one, ends up on four at a time on average.
[03:10:23.301 --> 03:10:27.163]  And remember, when they have foster kids under their control, 68 to 69% national average, they put on the drugs.
[03:10:31.260 --> 03:10:34.101]  Now, I mean, is that normal to put 69% of people on drugs?
[03:10:35.661 --> 03:10:47.804]  Then it says, dark minds, and it says, I didn't have any friends in high school, and I didn't want to give them friends' names, or family's phone number.
[03:10:48.745 --> 03:10:52.466]  Like I'm a liar, that my family doesn't want to talk to them, or I wouldn't have my friends.
[03:10:52.806 --> 03:10:54.826]  The guy said it wasn't a hit piece, right away it was.
[03:10:55.566 --> 03:10:57.287]  And I said to the guy, I said, I wouldn't
[03:10:58.148 --> 03:11:03.293]  Put my friends or family on the phone with you, you know, knowing that you lied and this is a hit piece.
[03:11:06.535 --> 03:11:07.816]  But he doesn't say what I said.
[03:11:07.857 --> 03:11:10.659]  He just says, Alex didn't have friends.
[03:11:10.679 --> 03:11:12.040]  So it's all about being popular.
[03:11:12.461 --> 03:11:15.723]  See, but through him, the priest, I can find enlightenment.
[03:11:16.464 --> 03:11:18.546]  And I'm not in a junior high argument.
[03:11:19.287 --> 03:11:21.609]  It's actually embarrassing how popular I was.
[03:11:21.669 --> 03:11:23.110]  It's actually embarrassing.
[03:11:27.276 --> 03:11:29.457]  That, I mean, the way I was in high school.
[03:11:31.397 --> 03:11:34.818]  I mean, I really cleaned up the last year or so and got straight A's and got out of there.
[03:11:34.838 --> 03:11:42.760]  But I mean, it was, you know, the cheerleaders and drinking and fighting and having a great time and camping and just, you know, just it was a giant party.
[03:11:43.360 --> 03:11:45.800]  I mean, but the point is, is it doesn't matter.
[03:11:46.661 --> 03:11:47.641]  That isn't for me.
[03:11:47.861 --> 03:11:50.401]  That's for the weak minded, mainly women that read this.
[03:11:50.822 --> 03:11:52.442]  Oh, look, Alex Jones isn't cool.
[03:11:55.051 --> 03:11:58.734]  I mean, it's just total junior high mentality, and it's just lie after lie.
[03:12:01.136 --> 03:12:08.321]  And they quote Louis Black of the Chronicle, who's always made up stuff about me.
[03:12:08.341 --> 03:12:16.167]  This is a guy who writes full-page editorials in his own rag paper, you know, with stories in between the porno shop ads.
[03:12:17.708 --> 03:12:20.212]  That says that Sintra is not Spanish owned.
[03:12:20.232 --> 03:12:23.778]  Just totally has disdain and contempt for his readers.
[03:12:23.818 --> 03:12:25.080]  Thinks they're complete morons.
[03:12:26.262 --> 03:12:28.566]  We're all conspiracy theorists to some degree.
[03:12:28.706 --> 03:12:31.831]  We're all hardwired to find patterns of threat.
[03:12:34.904 --> 03:12:42.806]  And it says, information is the conspiracy terrorist's weapon of choice because if there's one thing they all agree on, it's that all the rest of us have been brainwashed.
[03:12:43.506 --> 03:12:47.227]  The facts will plainly reveal the existence of conspiracy, they believe.
[03:12:47.688 --> 03:12:51.208]  And while all of, I mean, look at Blackwater with rape rooms and murdering people.
[03:12:51.469 --> 03:12:53.289]  We said that and got called conspiracy terrorist.
[03:12:53.989 --> 03:12:56.390]  Cheney wanted to stage terror attacks, now declassified.
[03:12:56.610 --> 03:12:57.790]  We were called conspiracy terrorist.
[03:12:57.810 --> 03:13:01.191]  We said the NSA was spying on everybody, now that's declassified.
[03:13:01.411 --> 03:13:03.792]  We said Obama's setting up youth brigades, now it's admitted.
[03:13:04.212 --> 03:13:05.213]  We're right about everything.
[03:13:05.233 --> 03:13:06.314]  We go off the documents.
[03:13:09.216 --> 03:13:14.599]  All while all of us tend to bend information to fit our pre-existing cognitive scheme.
[03:13:14.940 --> 03:13:16.441]  Oh, everybody bends information.
[03:13:16.521 --> 03:13:16.841]  No, sir.
[03:13:17.742 --> 03:13:19.623]  Conspiracy theorists are more extreme.
[03:13:19.963 --> 03:13:21.324]  They are immune to evidence.
[03:13:21.865 --> 03:13:22.165]  Really?
[03:13:22.205 --> 03:13:23.446]  You're the one that's immune to evidence.
[03:13:23.926 --> 03:13:32.232]  Disconnecting, contradicting information or seeing it as proof of how clever the enemy is at covering things up.
[03:13:35.031 --> 03:13:44.021]  Conspiracy theorists exist on a spectrum from mild suspicion to full of paranoia and brain chemistry may play a role.
[03:13:49.046 --> 03:13:53.451]  Dopamine rewards us for noting patterns and finding meaning in sometimes
[03:13:54.554 --> 03:13:55.574]  In significant events.
[03:13:55.594 --> 03:14:01.557]  Yeah, there's a saber-toothed tiger in those woods and you see him moving and pick up the pattern and can tell that's a big cat.
[03:14:01.877 --> 03:14:03.877]  That means you survived and passed your genes on.
[03:14:04.217 --> 03:14:06.678]  But I don't know how the genes of these psychologists got passed on.
[03:14:06.858 --> 03:14:10.840]  They could have a cat right in front of them and say, that's a conspiracy theory because they live in denial.
[03:14:12.680 --> 03:14:15.722]  It's long been known that schizophrenics overproduce dopamine.
[03:14:15.742 --> 03:14:16.582]  See, we're schizophrenic.
[03:14:17.372 --> 03:14:24.876]  The earliest stages of delusion are characterized by an overabundance of meaningful coincidence, explained Paul D. Morrison of R.M.
[03:14:24.936 --> 03:14:28.118]  Murray, an institute of psychiatry at King's College, London.
[03:14:29.339 --> 03:14:34.702]  Jumping to conclusions is a common reasoning style among the paranoid.
[03:14:35.885 --> 03:14:39.027]  Find Daniel Freeman and his colleagues also at the Institute of Psychiatry.
[03:14:39.067 --> 03:14:41.728]  Indeed, there are no coincidences in Jones' world.
[03:14:42.128 --> 03:14:45.530]  In a scene from the Obama deception, Jones dives into the belly of the beast.
[03:14:46.190 --> 03:14:48.531]  The hotel where purported conspirators will be meeting.
[03:14:48.792 --> 03:14:51.333]  It was in the news that world leaders were there setting policy.
[03:14:51.593 --> 03:14:53.694]  The Bilderberg brags they set policy.
[03:14:53.994 --> 03:14:55.155]  We were being followed.
[03:14:55.475 --> 03:14:57.296]  They did pull a fire alarm to blame it on us.
[03:14:57.336 --> 03:14:58.577]  They told us they were going to do it.
[03:14:59.317 --> 03:15:02.759]  And I told that, he just thought, he told me on the phone,
[03:15:03.559 --> 03:15:05.920]  That he didn't even believe there was a meeting going on.
[03:15:06.180 --> 03:15:18.884]  I mean, I was literally, he believes, schizophrenically stumbling around the hotel with news cameras and that there weren't black cars, there weren't sedans, there weren't Secret Service, there weren't guys pointing machine guns at us.
[03:15:20.085 --> 03:15:23.866]  I mean, I was having a full-on, total hallucination.
[03:15:28.027 --> 03:15:29.728]  And people reading this believe it!
[03:15:30.528 --> 03:15:32.729]  He just talked about schizophrenia and now I'm having a
[03:15:37.401 --> 03:15:39.643]  And the thing is, they cold-bloodedly know it's true!
[03:15:40.063 --> 03:15:43.326]  They just... it's total scam!
[03:15:44.367 --> 03:15:45.248]  I mean, who do they prey on?
[03:15:45.308 --> 03:15:46.469]  School kids with their drugs!
[03:15:48.490 --> 03:15:52.434]  I mean, this is in between ads where it says it makes you commit suicide!
[03:15:54.892 --> 03:16:00.394]  You understand this guy over the phone denied that the lobotomies were done at public fairs with ice picks?
[03:16:00.414 --> 03:16:06.636]  I mean, you can just Google ice picks, lobotomies, and it just, it's NPR, AP, Reuters.
[03:16:06.916 --> 03:16:08.076]  He just, it didn't true!
[03:16:09.036 --> 03:16:10.137]  It didn't true, he said!
[03:16:15.672 --> 03:16:19.956]  Jones says that he has been visited by the FBI and Secret Service, but can't discuss the interviews.
[03:16:20.296 --> 03:16:25.200]  Well, he asked me if I've ever been visited by the Feds, and I said, yeah, but it's a court case, gag order.
[03:16:25.561 --> 03:16:26.441]  I told him!
[03:16:28.043 --> 03:16:29.804]  He knows that in federal court cases.
[03:16:30.465 --> 03:16:33.868]  And it's now in the AP, and it's now in Wired Magazine.
[03:16:35.249 --> 03:16:36.590]  And he doesn't care, folks.
[03:16:36.650 --> 03:16:37.291]  He just says,
[03:16:38.511 --> 03:16:39.172]  It's so sick.
[03:16:39.793 --> 03:16:43.577]  Jones says that he has been visited by the FBI and Secret Service but can't discuss the interviews.
[03:16:44.017 --> 03:16:48.822]  It may be that the federal agents, in fact, want to evaluate whether he is a threat to the president.
[03:16:49.554 --> 03:16:51.356]  And then he goes in and talks about Richard McCaslin.
[03:16:51.917 --> 03:16:53.298]  Then it says, the war continues.
[03:16:53.338 --> 03:16:58.965]  In a video promoting the Obama deception, Jones urges, we know who they are, we know what they are, we know what has to be done.
[03:16:59.265 --> 03:17:02.569]  I'm talking about peacefully, in that section, getting the word out.
[03:17:02.829 --> 03:17:05.813]  He cuts it out and makes it look like I'm calling for violence.
[03:17:06.213 --> 03:17:09.557]  But he preys on his little stable of readers.
[03:17:10.558 --> 03:17:15.981]  Who don't understand this, desperately trying to keep them on the reservation so they can sell them their drugs.
[03:17:16.241 --> 03:17:17.101]  And they brag right here.
[03:17:17.161 --> 03:17:19.842]  They go, hey, we're a fast-growing business.
[03:17:20.943 --> 03:17:22.444]  Go to the Chicago Business School.
[03:17:22.984 --> 03:17:26.986]  One of the top ten fastest growing professions is psychology.
[03:17:27.006 --> 03:17:27.726]  See, it's a business.
[03:17:28.026 --> 03:17:36.090]  Recruiting their priest corps to go out and sell the drugs for their Thulse of Doom mind control system.
[03:17:36.812 --> 03:17:38.093]  Candy for the kids.
[03:17:38.113 --> 03:17:41.215]  Look, candy Prozac that makes you commit suicide.
[03:17:41.275 --> 03:17:41.676]  Right here.
[03:17:42.096 --> 03:17:44.618]  It's candy that tastes good and dissolves in the mouth.
[03:17:44.658 --> 03:17:47.120]  I mean, you couldn't make up something this bizarre.
[03:17:47.360 --> 03:17:50.122]  And then he says I'm lying about doing lots of interviews with the media.
[03:17:50.583 --> 03:17:55.046]  He just, I mean, it's just, you know, you are the liar and the fraud, sir, and everybody knows it.
[03:17:58.029 --> 03:18:02.332]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[03:18:02.553 --> 03:18:04.954]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[03:18:05.115 --> 03:18:14.542]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[03:18:14.702 --> 03:18:20.588]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[03:18:20.889 --> 03:18:23.391]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[03:18:23.592 --> 03:18:33.282]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[03:18:33.422 --> 03:18:34.003]  I think so.
[03:18:58.044 --> 03:19:05.609]  Robert Beatle's new book, Here's What You Do, was written for anyone who wants to survive the upcoming and ongoing financial storm.
[03:19:05.809 --> 03:19:10.712]  Get prepared and go to here'swhatyoudo.net and buy the $6 book.
[03:19:10.872 --> 03:19:16.416]  He is also trying to help us by running for Congress to stop the thievery and loss of liberties.
[03:19:16.656 --> 03:19:21.241]  Please arm yourself with his guide and go to hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[03:19:21.361 --> 03:19:23.363]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[03:19:23.524 --> 03:19:25.125]  Hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[03:19:25.366 --> 03:19:27.608]  Again, hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[03:19:27.808 --> 03:19:29.310]  Wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[03:19:29.430 --> 03:19:33.735]  Is your financial advisor experienced enough to combat rising interest rates, taxes, inflation?
[03:19:33.955 --> 03:19:37.579]  Stop guessing and go to the expert, Robert Chapman of the International Forecaster.
[03:19:37.679 --> 03:19:38.079]  We're good to go.
[03:19:58.829 --> 03:20:04.131]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:20:04.651 --> 03:20:11.633]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:20:12.213 --> 03:20:18.375]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:20:18.815 --> 03:20:20.656]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:20:20.777 --> 03:20:23.198]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:20:23.278 --> 03:20:34.246]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:20:34.866 --> 03:20:36.147]  It's not about left or right.
[03:20:36.547 --> 03:20:37.928]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:20:38.409 --> 03:20:44.613]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:20:45.299 --> 03:20:53.061]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:20:53.561 --> 03:20:54.681]  The Obama Deception.
[03:20:55.122 --> 03:20:56.402]  The people strike back.
[03:21:05.404 --> 03:21:07.925]  You know, coming up in the next few weeks when I have time,
[03:21:10.137 --> 03:21:24.097]  This is a case point example, because when people Google the name of this quack pseudoscience, 150 years ago you could pull up a trailer and sell snake oil of opium and tell people it would cure cancer.
[03:21:25.541 --> 03:21:27.802]  And that's when psychiatry and psychology was set up.
[03:21:27.983 --> 03:21:35.487]  It's just a total quack thing that's grandfathered, and they just make really dangerous drugs and push them on people and work with the government.
[03:21:36.048 --> 03:21:39.510]  And they're a bunch of quacks and the government's always loved them and used them to oppress people.
[03:21:40.030 --> 03:21:41.051]  They're just scam artists.
[03:21:42.011 --> 03:21:43.232]  And I've had enough of them.
[03:21:43.292 --> 03:21:45.514]  I mean, this is a dissolve-in-your-mouth, tastes-good,
[03:21:46.596 --> 03:21:55.345]  Easy to swallow, pleasant tasting form of drug like candy that dissolves in your mouth and it makes you commit suicide.
[03:21:56.225 --> 03:22:03.653]  And then the next page, they are attacking me saying I'm crazy and then saying I'm a liar.
[03:22:05.532 --> 03:22:07.813]  Saying I'm a liar about everything.
[03:22:08.573 --> 03:22:12.994]  And using primitive mind control on innocent people that are reading this.
[03:22:13.415 --> 03:22:15.795]  Going, hey, this is a magazine mainly targeting women.
[03:22:15.815 --> 03:22:17.516]  That's who they mainly prey on, women and children.
[03:22:18.316 --> 03:22:19.257]  They're predators, folks.
[03:22:19.297 --> 03:22:20.437]  What's a big cat go for?
[03:22:20.497 --> 03:22:23.558]  Goes for small, goes for female, goes for weak.
[03:22:24.558 --> 03:22:25.859]  I'm just sick of you, man.
[03:22:25.879 --> 03:22:28.640]  You make me... Because it freaks me out that they know they're lying.
[03:22:28.840 --> 03:22:29.320]  That's what's...
[03:22:30.250 --> 03:22:35.111]  I mean, I know there's evil out there, but just to see them enjoying conning people.
[03:22:35.552 --> 03:22:45.054]  Look, I see right through you guys, and we're going to fight you as hard as we can, but God, they're having their way with the kids in the schools right now.
[03:22:45.074 --> 03:22:55.277]  Remember the head of the state psychiatry said in my film Endgame, said, oh, we got 69% of the kids on psychotropics, their foster care, because they have bad genes.
[03:22:55.557 --> 03:22:56.477]  These are eugenicists.
[03:22:57.238 --> 03:22:58.218]  The last three minutes here,
[03:22:59.650 --> 03:23:03.371]  We're getting a lady coming up tomorrow, the next day, who's following the suit on Obama.
[03:23:03.391 --> 03:23:04.691]  We got our wires crossed on that.
[03:23:05.852 --> 03:23:09.693]  Rebroadcast starts in a few minutes with Steve Quayle and all the other guests we had on today.
[03:23:09.713 --> 03:23:12.414]  We had the pastor on that the media is demonizing.
[03:23:13.794 --> 03:23:15.315]  Great job to the producers and the crew.
[03:23:16.675 --> 03:23:17.835]  Big news coming up next week.
[03:23:17.855 --> 03:23:19.076]  I'm just going to leave it at that for you.
[03:23:19.396 --> 03:23:19.776]  Huge.
[03:23:20.536 --> 03:23:20.836]  Huge.
[03:23:21.116 --> 03:23:21.596]  Biggest ever.
[03:23:22.697 --> 03:23:23.037]  Tuesday.
[03:23:24.217 --> 03:23:26.358]  May even do it Monday, but just keep your eyes open.
[03:23:26.934 --> 03:23:28.835]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up in the last three minutes.
[03:23:28.915 --> 03:23:37.421]  Ted, since you were on, gold went from $9.80 to the $9.93 and is going up.
[03:23:38.261 --> 03:23:44.805]  You bought gold at the $9.05, $9.11, $9.14, $9.15, $9.16, depending on the different gold offers you've got.
[03:23:45.245 --> 03:23:48.908]  Silver's up, what is it, over a dollar today.
[03:23:49.608 --> 03:23:55.532]  Explain to people, you bought gold and silver when silver was a couple bucks cheaper and gold was
[03:23:58.414 --> 03:24:01.876]  $70, almost $80 less and you're passing that saving on.
[03:24:01.976 --> 03:24:04.318]  No one can get a deal like this anywhere, Ted.
[03:24:04.778 --> 03:24:05.659]  Well, that's true, Alex.
[03:24:05.699 --> 03:24:07.259]  I can tell you right now, I went out to lunch.
[03:24:07.319 --> 03:24:09.301]  Silver was at $15.50.
[03:24:10.161 --> 03:24:11.542]  I came back from lunch, it was at $16.50.
[03:24:13.843 --> 03:24:16.544]  Silver currently right now is at $16.31.
[03:24:16.924 --> 03:24:19.845]  Gold has hit a high right now at $9.9870.
[03:24:20.245 --> 03:24:22.045]  The market is going wild right now.
[03:24:22.085 --> 03:24:23.025]  It's breaking upward.
[03:24:23.425 --> 03:24:25.306]  It's not surprising for me to see this.
[03:24:25.386 --> 03:24:26.486]  It's right on time.
[03:24:27.206 --> 03:24:33.068]  With as strong as it is right now, I'm expecting to have even greater results this fall than I expected earlier.
[03:24:33.408 --> 03:24:41.410]  And I can just tell you, as a trader and being involved in the precious metals for as long as I have been, this is a sign that the prices are going to be rising.
[03:24:41.850 --> 03:24:45.811]  Because we had a support level at about 945 here recently.
[03:24:46.171 --> 03:24:51.773]  The sellers ran out of gas at about that level, and then the buyers would take over and start to move upward.
[03:24:51.933 --> 03:24:55.494]  Well, notice Bloomberg and the elites are saying gold's got a rocket tied to it.
[03:24:55.854 --> 03:25:01.256]  Regardless, people can buy gold at almost $80 less per ounce than it was a week ago.
[03:25:01.636 --> 03:25:03.157]  Ladies and gentlemen, you can't beat it.
[03:25:03.177 --> 03:25:03.217]  800-686-2237.
[03:25:03.237 --> 03:25:03.277]  800-686-2237.
[03:25:10.299 --> 03:25:11.339]  Don't procrastinate.
[03:25:11.359 --> 03:25:15.040]  The Brokers will be there past midnight, Central, tonight.
[03:25:15.360 --> 03:25:16.921]  Ted, how long can you hold this deal?
[03:25:16.961 --> 03:25:19.621]  Well, I'm telling you, I'll hold this deal into tomorrow, but that's it.
[03:25:19.681 --> 03:25:21.081]  I can't hold it any further than that.
[03:25:21.181 --> 03:25:22.122]  Prices will go up.
[03:25:22.162 --> 03:25:23.842]  This is it.
[03:25:23.862 --> 03:25:25.582]  This is it.
[03:25:25.602 --> 03:25:26.063]  800-686-2237.
[03:25:26.103 --> 03:25:27.703]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones Special.
[03:25:27.723 --> 03:25:31.804]  You'll pay $80 more an ounce.
[03:25:31.824 --> 03:25:32.104]  800-686-2237.
[03:25:32.224 --> 03:25:33.304]  Great job to the crew.
[03:25:33.624 --> 03:25:35.425]  That was out of the park today on the Info War.
[03:25:35.625 --> 03:25:36.665]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:25:38.018 --> 03:25:43.080]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[03:25:43.680 --> 03:25:47.002]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[03:25:47.822 --> 03:25:52.824]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:25:53.024 --> 03:25:56.825]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:25:57.045 --> 03:26:02.668]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:26:02.968 --> 03:26:06.009]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name
